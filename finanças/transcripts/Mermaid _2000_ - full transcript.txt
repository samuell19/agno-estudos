♪ DESI: Once upon a time, there was a mermaid, and she liked to play with real people on top of the water, but her daddy said that she was very naughty, and so he went away. You have been very naughty, mermaid, and now you must be punished. The mermaid was very sorry, and she promised never to be naughty again, and she swam away forever looking for her daddy. TRISH: Desi! Hi. Come on in, honey. We have to get ready. Desi spilled milk. That'’s all right. [ sniffles ] Desi'’s grandma'’s here. Did she bring pizza? Yes. Now, you go ahead and eat. I'’ll clean this up. Can Desi go play? Eat your pizza first. Is Desi'’s mommy crying? I'’m just tired, honey. Now, go on and eat your pizza before it gets cold. What happened? Oh, she just dropped her milk. Is she any better? It'’s just a phase. The doctor said it'’s just a way of putting herself outside of her pain. She'’ll grown out of it and stop talking that way. Four months is a pretty long phase, referring to herself in the third person as though she'’s somebody else? She'’s doing the best she can, Mom. I know, honey. I'’m just concerned for her. So am I, Mom. So am I. [ violin playing "Twinkle Twinkle Little Star" ] Is that all of it? Everything but this little girl and her violin. Honey, you'’d better hurry out to the barn if you want to say goodbye to Tex. Desi doesn'’t want to say goodbye. Oh, honey, Mr. Henderson will take good care of him. Now, come on and let'’s go, huh? Want me to take your dolly? Aren'’t you going to lock up? You know, it'’d serve the bank right if we burn this place down. Aw, you'’re better off out from underneath it. We built this place, Mom.

I don'’t know if I can do this alone. You'’re not doing it alone. You'’ve got your family here. We'’re not going to let anything happen to you. I don'’t know what to tell her, Mom. Well, you'’ve got to tell her the truth. She wants to see him. What am I supposed to say? That he'’s never going to come back. You can'’t hide that from her, honey. I'’m not trying to hide it from her, but I want to do this in a way that won'’t hurt her too much, so she can try and accept it. She'’s never going to be able to accept it until you do, sweetheart, and it ain'’t easy to accept. What'’s his name again? Steve Stutts. Don'’t you remember him from high school? He works for Quaid now. He offered to help us unload today. Oh, yeah. He looked familiar. It'’s been so long. Quaid likes him a lot. He says he'’s a real hard worker.

That'’s right, sweetheart. Where is he? You remember what I told you? He'’s in heaven. RHONDA: That'’s right, honey. Where'’s heaven? A long way away. What do daddies do in heaven? Is that where they work? Maybe, honey. I don'’t know. Can Desi go see him? Oh, it'’s not that easy, Des. People can'’t just go there. Why not? Well, it'’s not on the earth, where we live. How do daddies get there? What do you think? An angel came and took him. That'’s right, honey. Why is his picture here? This is a very special place. When we want to think about your daddy, we come here. It'’s kind of like his mailbox to heaven. You understand? When will the angel bring him back? Desi, Daddy'’s not coming back. Once people go to heaven, they have to stay there. But even though he went away, we can always come here to talk to him. But Daddy wouldn'’t leave without saying goodbye. [ Rhonda sighs ] Oh... [ Desi crying ] You okay, Des? Sweetheart, why are you crying? Desi had a bad dream. [ sighs ] Are they going to come and take you, too? Who? The angels. Are they going to take you to be with Daddy?

[ door slams ] Quaid... Sorry. What a day. Say, Rhonda, the lasers on the duster are going to be down all next week, you know, and I'’ve got to seed Rocky'’s whole spread in one day. I was thinking, as long as you'’re around anyway, why don'’t you come out and do some flagging for us? Well, it ain'’t up to her, girl. You can bring Des. Fresh air would do you good. Besides, I'’m paying. I'’m not a charity case, Quaid. You'’ve got to pay somebody. Besides, you will earn it. I haven'’t flagged since I was 14. Like falling off a log. Do us good to get out of the house. Besides, you can teach the little one the tricks of the trade. [ glass breaks ] Desi? ♪ Desi, are you all right? DESI: Desi'’s all right. Open the door, Des.

Place is falling apart, huh? [ grunts ] Oh, Desi. TRISH: Oh, honey. Well, what are we going to do with her? Desi wants to cut her own hair. You already did that, young lady. Short is the only answer I can think of. Now, why did she do it, anyway? We'’re not sure. Desi wants another chance. Desiree, I don'’t understand. Why are you being so naughty? She wanted a haircut. [ sighs ] Well, that'’s fine, but you have to ask Mommy or Grandma. Yeah, you know, scissors are very dangerous. She looks so different. Yeah, it'’s a change, all right, but we'’ll get used to it. I'’ve had enough changes. Anything else? Check, please. I'’ll take that. You don'’t have to do that, Mom. It'’s my pleasure. [ sighs ] Yeah, changes. That'’s what it'’s all about, you know. I just want things to be predictable. I hate to be the one to break it to you, honey, but life just isn'’t predictable... and if it was, it would be damn boring. You never know what'’s coming around the next corner. You can stay in bed all day long and still get struck by lightning, so I figure you may as well get on out there and start living again. You know, Mom, I can'’t deal with what'’s going to happen five minutes from now. I'’m just taking it as it comes, so stop pushing. Honey, I didn'’t mean to push you. I was just trying to help. This isn'’t something you can just fix. I know. I wish I could. Look, I know you have to grieve. I just hope that you remember that eventually, it really will be all right. Everything isn'’t going to be all right. Mother, I'’m 25 years old. I have a daughter and no husband, no job. I lost my house. Everything. I'’m living back home with my mother. Maybe that'’s all right for you, but I was abandoned. [ crying ] What I'’m suggesting to you is that if you could stop focusing on what you don'’t have, you might find the grace to be thankful for what you do have. Like what? Well, like a family who loves her, for one thing. An adorable little girl. The good sense that God gave you. You weren'’t abandoned. Abandoned is when your husband walks out on you with your two little girls. Even though he lives not more than 300 miles away, he acts as though he never even had a family. That'’s abandoned. [ chuckles ] Oh, Mom. I'’m real sorry you lost Ken, honey, and I know you'’re going to miss him for a long, long time. But you know in your heart that he never stopped loving you. You remember that. I wish I had that, instead of spending the rest of my life wondering what I could have done differently to make your daddy want to stay. How'’s that ice cream, hmm?

Is that why her daddy went away? What? Because she was a naughty girl? Honey, come here. Listen to me. Daddy didn'’t go away because you were a bad girl. You'’re not a bad girl. Sometimes you do naughty things. Everybody does. That'’s not why Daddy went away. Then why? Why did he go with the angels? [ sighs ] I don'’t know, honey. It was just his time. Desi wants to see Daddy. Desi wants to talk to him. Desi wants to say goodbye. I know, honey. I do too. [ door opens ] Ooh. What'’s this picture you drew? Can you tell Grandma what you'’ve got there? That'’s Daddy in the clouds. He cries when he misses us, and that'’s when it rains. Desi, you know it'’s all right to cry if you'’re sad. Desi doesn'’t want to cry. Desi doesn'’t want to be sad. Well, yes, I understand, but I'’m saying if you are sad, it'’s all right to cry. [ sighs ] Does Daddy really have a mailbox to heaven? What do you mean, honey? In the place by the white fence? Oh, the cemetery? Well, that'’s a place where we remember Daddy. Where the mailman comes from the clouds? In a way. Maybe a mailman comes for our thoughts and memories and good wishes.

You thirsty? Yes, sir. You want a drink? Mountain Dew, please. Well, what do you know? How did you do that? Magic, I guess. Sometimes Papa Quaid gives Desi free ones. He has the keys. There you go.

Oh, honey, even though we'’re writing this letter to Daddy, he'’s not ever going to be able to come home. I don'’t want you to think that he is, okay? Okay. The real reason that we'’re doing this is just so that you can get your feelings down on paper, and so that you can share things with Daddy as if he was here. Desi knows, Grandma.

I think they do, yes. Desi used to have a pony named "Tex." [ sighs ] Hello? Hello. Look, I don'’t want to intrude, but I have a couple of tickets to the county fair this weekend, and I thought Desi might want to come along with me. If you'’re asking for a date, why don'’t you come out and say so, then I can politely say "no" and we'’ll be done with it. It'’s none of my business, but I think Desi'’s a little too young to date.

It was not a bad idea to help her express what she felt. All I'’m saying is I'’ve been out over these fields for a lot of years, and I ain'’t seen Peter Rabbit yet. This is not about Peter Rabbit. It'’s about feelings. You remember what those are, don'’t you, Quaid? Feelings? Mother, all she'’s going to be is disappointed. Well, hello there. Hello. Do you have any mail for us today? You beat me to the punch. Let me see. You going to be sure to get this all home, now? Yes, sir. Careful, now. Thank you. Des? Desi? Hey, kiddo. What you doing? Honey. Honey, why are you crying? Nobody took Desi'’s letter to Daddy. Return to sender, huh? I'’m sorry, honey. The wind must have blown it away again. But Desi thought Daddy would read her letter. [ sighs ] Grandma told you, honey. That'’s not why we wrote the letter. Why, then? So you could put your feelings that you'’re feeling on the inside on the outside. That way, they wouldn'’t stay locked up in your heart and keep you sad anymore. Are you sad anymore? Sometimes, but when I am, I come outside and I listen to the breeze and I imagine I can hear Daddy whispering to me. What does he say? That everything happens for a reason, and that somewhere down the line, it'’s all going to work out. Anyway, listen, I'’ve been doing some thinking, and I'’ve decided that if you still want to, we can go to the fair. How does that sound? Desi could go on the ponies? You can go on whatever you want.

"Dear Desiree Leanne, Happy Birthday. I hope we'’re not late, but if we are, hope you had a terrific day. I guess you must be wondering who we are. It'’s a long, long story, but here I begin." What is this? It'’s okay, I promise. "It all started one morning when my husband went duck-hunting... and guess what he found? No, it wasn'’t a duck. It was a mermaid. Actually, it was the mermaid balloon that you had sent your daddy in heaven. It wasn'’t until my husband returned home with the balloon that we read the note you had attached to it. Well, at first we thought maybe we should put it back where we found it, but after we read the note again, we realized your daddy had already received the balloon and was sending it back so someone would find it. He wanted someone to find it so they could send you something for your birthday. There are no stores in heaven, so your daddy wanted someone to do his shopping for him. I think he picked us because the name of our community is '’Mermaid,'’ and also, we have three children, and our oldest daughter'’s birthday is also in January. [ sniffles ] I know your daddy would want you to be happy and not to be sad. I know he loves you very much, and will always be watching over you. Once again, happy fifth birthday.

Quaid, I think you need to have this thing looked at. Forget about it. You made the papers. What? What? Look at this. You'’re celebrities. "Magic balloon proves dreams do come true." Honey. Desi, that'’s you. "As four-year-old Desiree Gill watched the silver helium balloon float up and away with a note to her daddy in heaven, she knew she'’d get a reply." "Her mother and grandmother weren'’t so sure, and were amazed when they got a letter from a family in Prince Edward Island, Canada, nearly 3,800 miles across the continent." "Wade MacKinnon, who lives in a community called '’Mermaid,'’ found the balloon while duck-hunting, and his family responded in kind. Desiree has only one wish left... to see the magical land of mermaids, and to meet her new distant de facto miracle family on Prince Edward Island on the east coast of Canada." H, I, J, K, L, M, N... O! O, that'’s right. Can you do that? Good job, sweetheart. That'’s excellent. Very good. Desi, there'’s someone to see you. Hello. Special delivery for Desiree Leanne Gill. RHONDA: What'’s this? It'’s all for the little girl. She told me she was waiting on some mail. I just didn'’t figure she'’d get it all on the same day. Well, see you tomorrow. Bye. Thank you. These letters are all for you, Des. "Dear Desiree, Our family was so deeply touched by the story of the balloon and your friends on Prince Edward Island. We hope this will get you there a little sooner. All the best. Sincerely, Schmidt." There'’s a check here for $20. "Dear Gill family, After reading your story in the Examiner, we wanted to help Desiree with her wish to meet the MacKinnons, so we collected some money in hopes of fulfilling the dream." [ sniffles ] Are these all from Yuba City? Not all, but a lot of them. Look, Mommy. A balloon. They'’re all like this. "Dear Desiree, I know you lost your daddy. How was your birthday? My birthday is in September. I want you to see your new balloon friends, so here is my allowance. Love, Tessa. P.S. Please come back to school and tell us about Mermaid Lake."

No need to ruin a perfectly good cup of joe with something that comes out of a cow. [ chuckles ] Black as August road tar is the way I like it. You know, where we live near Yuba City is a hunter'’s dream. We know a lot of hunters, and when they go hunting, that'’s pretty much all they'’re out to do.

[ chuckles ] And, Donna, the way you told the story in your letter so Desi could understand, I don'’t know how to tell you how much that meant to her... meant to us, really. Well, it meant a lot to us, too. WADE: "Blinded by tears, the mermaid fell overboard into the sea. Without her tail, she couldn'’t swim. She sank deeper and deeper into the darkening ocean. All at once, the black sea was filled with sparkling light, and three beautiful angels appeared beside the mermaid, lifting her out of the water. '’By sparing the prince, you'’ve earned a place with us,'’ said one of the lovely creatures. The mermaid'’s heart filled with joy, and with a smile, she flew off with her new friends into the light. The End." Where does the light go, Wade? It goes to heaven, Desi. The mermaid went with the angels to heaven? In the book, yeah. Mommy, Daddy'’s with the mermaid? Is that right? Well, honey... [ clears throat ] They both went into the light. There we go. Went to the light with the angels, and now he'’s safe, and he didn'’t forget me.
