A lot of traffic accidents on Valentine's yesterday. Luckily, they were all minor and not serious. A driver claimed his car suddenly teleported. A guy said he was riding a bicycle but suddenly found himself on the ground and his bike gone. Taipei City's Valentine Chemistry Contest was won by a couple who claim they saw a woman disappear into thin air. It's Valentine's Day, not Halloween! Miss, can I help you? I want to report something. Report what? I lost a day. What did you lose for a day? A day. Huh? A day disappeared. A whole day disappeared? Yes Where did you go? Nowhere Did you suffer any injury? Look at my arms. And my face. So sunburnt. You must have been at the beach all day. I didn't go to the beach. Then you must have slept in all day. How did I get sunburnt then? So which day did you lose? Yesterday Yesterday... Was yesterday important? Very important. Valentine's Day. Valentine's? That's ridiculous. I think so too. My Missing Valentine The One Who Disappeared "Me" I've always been a little quicker than everyone else. If others are trains, I'm the high speed rail. Stop. Yang Hsiao-chi. Again? Are you messing up on purpose? You always start too early. Five laps. Sucks I didn't do it on purpose. You know what? Being too fast is a curse. Yang Hsiao-chi. Let me do it. Ready... Yang Hsiao-chi! Ready... Yang Hsiao-chi! Are you rushing to be reincarnated? I probably was quicker than others in being reincarnated. "Dad" Mom: Finished? I laugh at jokes too early too. "Me" "Others" 1, 2, 3. I even blink too early when taking photos. Sir, don't count 1, 2, 3. OK, let's take another one. Keep going. Oh Made no difference. It never failed. A few head shots later, I'm suddenly 30 years old. Even now I wake up just before the alarm. That's right. A sleeping beauty must wake herself up. Then I have to work with that airhead at the post office. You slept over at your boyfriend's place? Being young is great. Your back's not even sore. Something wrong with your back? My essential oil works wonders. There's nothing wrong with my back. I just talk too much. Nothing works wonders on me. Look, here they come again. Wife hunters. Third group this month. What can I help you with? Oh, two packs of lucky rice. Lucky rice...? In the store room. How can you still be so clueless? All you do is "Uh oh". Uh oh... Please wait a minute. OK Ability is unimportant. Beauty is most important. Isn't she pretty? Look at her figure. You can tell she's a good girl. She's got a boyfriend. She's taken. Doesn't matter. She's fair game until she marries. Madam Counter No. 8 is also single. Want to check her out too? No thanks. Oh man. What did I do to deserve this? Beauty is whole life insurance. I am accident insurance. Accidentally roasted every day. Add you on Line. Add your ass. Sorry, I can't do that. I look right and want to slap her. I look left and wonder if that's my future. No, I should be looking forward. When I look forward, I see a weirdo who mails a letter every day. Standard mail, NT$8. Why don't you use the mailbox? Why don't you use the mailbox? Huh? Is this all my life will ever be? Reminds me of a quote I saw online: "Love yourself, because no one will." "Undelivered" Oh Rushing home to "cook"? We're eating at a night market. What are you doing for Valentine's? We're going to a rock concert. How nice. How many tickets? Two. My boyfriend snatched them up. Men are so useful. Quite useful indeed. You should get one too. OK, hurry home and cook. Night market. Remember to turn up the heat. Add some spice. Toss it around. Make it tasty. 5,6,7, 8... Sawadee kha, how are you? I am a Thai shrimp Jumping around in the water I live at a shrimp market Sawadee kha, how are you? I am a Thai shrimp I have a small wish A holiday in Pattaya Thai shrimp, Thai shrimp I smell best on a BBQ rack Thai shrimp, Thai shrimp Fried, grilled, roasted or hotpot Thai shrimp, Thai shrimp Forget about gout and allergies Thai shrimp, Thai shrimp Eat them all until there's none Stop running.

Oh~ Thai shrimp, Thai shrimp I smell best on a BBQ rack Thai shrimp, Thai shrimp Fried, grilled, roasted or hotpot Thai shrimp, Thai shrimp Forget about gout and allergies Thai shrimp, Thai shrimp Eat them all until there's none Round of applause. You've all been great. Everyone gets an A+. Thank you. See you all tomorrow. Well done. Bye! Miss Hey Why are you running? You want me to pay tuition? No! I came to tell you my dance lessons in the park are free. You're welcome to join. I've got terrible rhythm. I can't dance. No way. You look really fit. Your coordination should be pretty good. First time anyone has called me fit. Your makeup is fantastic. Doesn't come off with sweat. I'm not wearing makeup. Oh No wonder you look so natural. Natural beauty. Really? Miss This is my card. I teach dancing at the park to promote exercise. Today's my second day. It's not my day job. What do you do? I work in blockchain. Which chain? It's hi-tech. I'll explain it to you next time. It's OK, I won't get it anyway. You live nearby? I work at the post office over there. I come here for exercise after work. What kind of work do you do? Postal service. Packages, letters, lots of random stuff. Do you do insurance? Yeah, we mainly do life insurance. I happen to need life insurance. I don't have a post office bank account either. I should go set it up. Come look for me. Sure I'll go look for you. Sure Remember to come to class tomorrow. OK I'm going this way. I'm going that way. Bye Just one? NT$10 Miss You only bought one fish stick but you're taking all the free soup. "@♪&♪ % &@ &"$%:"@ What nationality are you today? Women live here, you know. Where? Where did you get that? Online How much? NT$290 So expensive? For three. Nice... What are you spraying? Bug spray. A bug kills bugs. I am Pixel Man. Valentine's is in a few days. Lovers from the classic fairy tale are about to meet again. For hundreds of years. Same place and same time. It can actually get quite boring. They're probably just on their smart phones the whole time. Events like Valentine's Day are awkward. It might be quite fun for couples. But for single people, it might be a form of pressure. For the heartbroken, it's basically rubbing salt in the wound. But like it or not, it's still coming. Last year's Valentine Chemistry Contest was a big hit. I heard they're running it again this year. First prize is 20,000km plane tickets and NT$200,000. Couples should go sign up. Let's stop talking about Valentine's today. Don't want to irritate all the single people. Let's talk about loss. Everyone has lost something before. Listeners are welcome to call in and share their most unforgettable experience of loss. Dad Where are you going? Buying tofu pudding. Why are you carrying a spatula? Huh? Um... I was waiting at home for you to come back for dinner. Your mom's not home. Take it back for me. I want tofu pudding too. Get me a serve. Oh Add mung beans. Mm OK Goodbye Bye "Three Days Later" It's been three days. He hasn't come home. He hasn't gone to work either. He's disappeared. No contact at all. It's OK, three days isn't that long. He'll be back in a couple of days. The last thing your father said was that he's going to buy tofu pudding? Yes, I told him to get me one with mung beans. "One Month Later" Tofu pudding. I've been to nearly all of Taipei's tofu pudding stores. None of them saw Mr. Yang that night. "Hubby, please come home!" Don't worry. We'll keep searching. We've had three-month missing cases where they came home in the end. Sis We lost a dad. Will someone else find a dad? Will they give him back to us? "Seven Months Later" Mrs. Yang. Uncle! Hi Have some ice blocks. Thank you. Thank you. Officer Lee. You're here. Thank you. How come you're suddenly moving? I've thought it through over these past six months. If someone really wants to hide from you, you'll never find them. Taipei's cost of living is too high. I'm taking the kids back to my parents' home in Hsinchu. Thank you for all your help. Don't mention it. It's our job. Take my husband's stuff. No We can't take people's things. Radio I want this. What a rude child... It's OK. We can't take people's things. Giving away all of dad's stuff is weird. This I thought chubby-faced Officer Lee would become our new dad. But he didn't. We'll be right back after the commercials. Don't go anywhere. No. 85 to Counter 8. Sir, we're up to No. 85 now. Your ticket says No. 57. So? It's my turn now. I went out to buy something and my number passed. You picked it up off the ground. I just saw someone toss it. When did you see me pick it up off the ground? Am I that type of person? I'm a college professor! I didn't say you were any type of person. Keep talking. I'm not saying anything. Keep talking and I'll file a complaint. Sir Go ahead! Please line up. Who are you? I'm No. 85. It's my turn. Don't push in. What are you doing? Excuse me. Sir What do you need? I'll serve you. What kind of service is this? Yes... Wait! I haven't gotten my stuff! I'm going to file a complaint. Sawadee kha! How are you? I want to open an account. Thanks Don't let such people bother you. Doesn't bother me. I'm used to it. You really want to open an account? Yeah And I came to tell you I'm not teaching tonight. Do you want to get insurance too? I'll get my colleague to open your account, then I'll help you with insurance. Give me your ID and name stamp. Stamp? I didn't bring it. Give me the info first. I'll read it over at home and do it next time. I think this policy is good for you. "Movie after work tomorrow?" "Moving too fast?" "I thought you had fast rhythm." OK See you tomorrow. Whatchu looking at? Hi, I'm Pixel Man. What is true love? A perfect connection between two souls? Or chemistry that makes your heart skip a beat? Is there really someone like that out there for you? Let's listen to a song I like. Hope you like it too. How do I tell you what I feel inside? I've been thinking all night Thinking so much it's embarrassing When I see you, I can't speak at all All I can do is lower my head Say you're the only one I think about My mood is like the spring breeze All I can do is write an express love letter Ah ~ Blackout But I haven't saved my file! Excuse me. That guy in the glasses keeps looking at you. No. 20 to Counter 7. Thank you No. 23 to Counter 8. Hi Miss Did you order lunch? I made it myself. Try it. You made it? Don't scold me if it's not tasty. I would never. I'll pick you up after work. Bye I'll treat you to lunch. Really? I'm fine. I'm fine. That movie was hilarious. It really was. The lunch you made was delicious. Thank you. You're welcome. What are your plans for Valentine's? Nothing. I've never celebrated Valentine's in my life. You? What are your plans? No plans. No? Liar. You look like you celebrate Valentine's every day. No way. I used to have a girlfriend. Two years ago, she died of leukemia. You must be very sad. Were you going to get married? I grew up in an orphanage. I've always wanted a warm home. You're an orphan? I don't have parents, but the orphanage was my home. I go back to visit whenever I have time. I donate half my income to them every month. Because I like kids. I like playing with them. But... there's a five-year-old girl there now named "Hearty". She has a congenital heart disease. Doctors say unless she gets a heart transplant, her life will always be in danger. Poor thing. Heart transplants are expensive. I've started saving money for her. That reminds me. Taipei City is running a Valentine's Day event. Valentine Chemistry Contest. First prize is NT$200,000 and 20,000km plane tickets. If we win first prize, we can start a heart transplant fund. What's the contest? Video of last year's contest is online. Here It's just a teamwork test. Not very hard. Something like this. Look OK What do you think? Is it too late to start practicing? No problem. We should start now. Let's go over there. Come, get your things. Let's go practice. Come on. Come on. The first test is a three-legged race. Let's put our stuff to the side. Here Let's start. Come I'll be on this side. OK OK? Try it on your own first. OK, go. 1, 2, 3, 4. Then... jump after 4. Jump, OK. Go 1, 2, 3, 4. Jump 1, 2, 3, 4. Jump, like this. Try with our shoe laces tied? OK. OK? You sure? Yep OK. Hold on. OK Should we lock arms? OK 1, 2, 3, 4. Jump Wait Get back up. Slower... Almost there. Slower... OK, keep going. Go... Quick! 1, 2, 3, 4. 5, 6, 7, 8. 1,2, 3,4... My bus. Wait! Are we really going to compete tomorrow? Isn't a bit ridiculous? Come on, why not? Won't cost us anything. You're really going all out. No, I just want to grab the opportunity. What opportunity? Ah The opportunity to help the little girl. 9 o'clock tomorrow morning. See you at Songshan Cultural and Creative Park. Oh no. My car's at the shop. I can't pick you up. It's OK, I'm used to catching the bus. Then I'll meet you there tomorrow. Don't blame me if we lose. Come on, we'll win for sure. Don't stand me up, OK? I won't. Pinky swear. Tired? Thank you. I live in this alley. Are you inviting me up? Sure My place is very small and old. Better not. It's OK. I was just kidding. I had a great time today. See you tomorrow. OK, let's win this. Mm Bye Wait Hi, everyone. I am Pixel Man. Tomorrow is Valentine's Day. Have you found someone yet? I have! Our call-in segment will start soon. Those who haven't found someone still have a few hours. Hurry! Good luck. Good luck to you all! Hello? Miss Please turn down your radio volume. Let's take our first call. Hi, I'm Pixel Man. I got through! My first time and I got through! Hi, how are you? What's your name? My name is Yang Hsiao-chi. Tomorrow is Valentine's Day. What are your plans? Got someone? Yeah, or else I wouldn't be calling. You talk so fast. I'm impatient. So, tell us where you're going tomorrow. I'm going to participate in the Valentine's Chemistry Contest. Seems a lot of people are participating. I heard it's quite fun. Is he your husband or boyfriend? How should I put it? I've only known him a few days. You are indeed impatient. You've only known him a few days yet you're spending Valentine's with him. You're under his spell. Not exactly. You should at least like him then. He's a pretty good guy. In what way? He... is healthy and likes to exercise. He's honest and kind. Let me tell you. He's had a very hard life, yet he's still passionate about helping others. Wow, let me guess. He must be very handsome. He's quite handsome, and very humorous too. I feel like I've accumulated 30 years of happiness, and it's all exploding at once. I never thought happiness could be like a truck charging towards me. OK, happy lady. I hope you win tomorrow. Yes, I will. Thank you. Happy Valentine's, everybody! Thank you. Bye. Bye. Thank you. Some say life is composed of many memories. Dating is creating memories. You're in their memories, they're in your memories. That's the best thing "Will happiness truly come?" But your precious memories could also mean nothing to them. That's life. "It will." Whether it's bitter or sweet, whether you're single or taken have a great Valentine's Day tomorrow. Goodnight Guess what color I'm thinking of? Pink Correct Baby, guess what color I'm thinking of. Yellow Correct We're winning the contest for sure. Guess what I ate last night? Beef noodle soup. I did! Let me guess what you ate last night. You ate... Tomato spaghetti, 6-piece chicken bucket, surf and turf pizza, BBQ ribs, and a brownie. How did you know? You ate all of it? All of it! You're amazing. 8:35 Excuse me, where's the Valentine's Day event? Huh? The Valentine's Day event is over. Isn't registration at 9am? It was held yesterday. Yesterday? Isn't it today? Today is Valentine's Day. Valentine's was yesterday. What's wrong with you? How is this possible? Today is Sunday, right? Miss Today is Monday. Huh? What day is it today? Monday How? What's up with you? Why is your face so red? Doing a blush commercial? How did you spend Valentine's Day? With whom? Nobody Whose body? "Valentine's Contest Winner Announced" Standard mail, NT$8. Oh, it's heavier than usual today. NT$24 This... Sorry Needs one more. Thanks Huh? Bye Ma'am Did Teacher Liu come today? Haven't seen him. Don't think he came, right? Haven't seen him. Thanks Yesterday... Was yesterday very important? Very important. Valentine's Day. Valentine's? That's ridiculous. That's why I'm reporting it. Fine, I'll open a file for you. Do you have any kind of ID? Driver's license or healthcare card. Yang Hsiao-chi. Can you help me look for someone? Who? A man named Wenson Liu. We had a date yesterday and he didn't show. He's still missing and I can't find him. Miss He's not missing. He just stood you up. Hi, I'm Pixel Man. We talked about losing things a few days ago. For me, losing socks is the strangest. You usually only lose one sock. Logically speaking, these two socks should get along quite well. Why would one run away from home, never to be found again? Is there a mysterious black hole in the house or a fourth dimension that it just fell into? How are you...? Not too good... Let's listen to a good song, then take calls from our listeners. Who tripped the breaker again? Sorry I was baking sausages in the oven. The fuse is blown. Go buy a new one with me. Oh Who are you?! Why are you in my closet?! I'm a gecko. A what? G.E.C.K.O. As in gecko. Gecko! You don't look like one. This BBQ mosquito is so crispy. Your name is Yang Hsiao-chi, right? Mm Here What's this? These are all your things. Huh? This is your first pacifier. The doll from when you were 3. I don't remember this doll. There's a lot your don't remember. Did I lose this many erasers? Erasers are the easiest to lose. So why do you have so much of my stuff? The job of a gecko is to patrol people's homes and put away the things you have forgotten. Then categorize them for safekeeping. It's kind of like... recycling collection? Similar, but not exactly the same. But why do geckos do this? How would I know? I was born into the job. Hurry up, I'm exhausted. I'm retiring today. 038? Keys often get lost too. When you lose something at home, it doesn't mean you didn't pay attention to it. What about my dad? He's been gone for over 10 years. No one paid attention to him even back then. Where is he? He's in... here. He's playing chess. Evidently. Where is this? Can't say. Why not? Gecko's are territorial. We don't share private details of our landlords. You geckos care about privacy too? Of course. The apartment you're living in now is managed by my nephew. He's over there right now. Say hi. Hi Can I ask one more question? Last question. Can love disappear? Forget it. I shouldn't be asking a gecko about relationships. All love is self-hypnosis. You're very negative. Reminds me of my past. You've been in love before? Of course. Do you think geckos are cold-blooded creatures? Huh? Aren't you? Are we? You are. What does that mean? Get out of here, I'm closing up. Last question. Really, last question. Move back. It's really the last one. Why did my Valentine's Day disappear? Gramps, you're amazing. You can fix anything! No big deal. Let me bake some sausages for you. Hsiao-chi, it's your lunch break now. Oh Sir What's the deal with that photo? How did you get that photo? You look familiar. You're the girl in the photo. Yes, I'm the girl. But why do you have that photo? Someone came in to develop it yesterday. Took a lot of photos. That one was my favorite, so I asked him if I could hang it up in the store. He said OK. What was he like? Huh? You don't know the guy who took your photo? Is he dark, muscular and has facial hair? No He's an old customer named A-Tail. Skinny and no facial hair. But that day, his face was swollen like a pig's head. Pig's head? Yeah Do you have his phone number? No, I don't. Hey, what are you doing? Sir, you know where this was taken? Where? I'm asking you! Why are you asking me? Why wouldn't you know where it was taken? I just don't! I can't tell. Looks like the beach. Look here. Looks like oyster shells. Oyster shells. Which beach? Yunlin and Chiayi have more oysters. Sir, can you give me this? Give it to you? But I like this photo. Look at it. Much prettier than the real you. I'll buy it off you then. Buy it? Fine, I'll give it to you. But next time come develop your photos here. OK, thanks. Thanks. Hey, the frame! Let me have it too! Crazy woman. Oh? Wedding photo? Where did you take it? Show me. Show your ass. How can I help you? I want to apply for a PO Box. Rental NT$300, deposit NT$400. Total NT$700. His face was swollen like a pig's head. Pig's head? Yeah Has the weirdo been here today? Who? The one who mails a letter every day. No Miss Oh All done, thanks. "A day disappeared. A person also disappeared." "And there's a photo of me. My eyes were actually open in it." "I had never been to that place. What is going on?" Hsiao-chi, why are you here? I came back to get something. I'm heading back to Taipei. Bye! Stop! Here Thanks At least have a meal before leaving. Why are you so sunburnt? Why didn't you bring your boyfriend to show me? I don't have a boyfriend. How is that possible when I made you so beautiful? You're so lame! Be more proactive. If you see one you like, just mount him. Is that what you did with dad? How else? He's so slow and shy. My flower would have withered from waiting. If you saw dad again, what's the first thing you'd say to him? F♪♪k you I love you? Shut up! Listen Learn from me if you encounter relationship issues. F♪♪k you Ah, yes. Haven't you been writing a novel? Is it a romance or horror? Something about black holes... A day that disappeared... Some photograph... I don't get any of it. How do you know all this? I saw it on Facebook. You have my Facebook? I've been liking all your posts. What name do you use? Amy You're Amy? I can't be Amy? You can... you can... OK, I'm full. I'm heading off. So soon? Wait Wait for me. Don't run! Yang Hsiao-chi! Take some home with you! No thanks, I've still got some. Bye Amy! F♪♪k you "Oyster bed" "Wenson Liu" F♪♪k you Manager Can PO Box number identify the branch? Nope. What do you want? Hsiao-chi, it's your lunch break now. OK If that weirdo comes in when I'm having lunch, make sure you let me know. Sure Call me. I need to go to the bathroom. If that weirdo comes in, remember to let me know. Manager, I'm taking annual leave. Hsiao-chi, I'm going to submit my... I'm taking annual leave. Fine, hang on. I wrote this. That new poetry contest. Finance, insurance and parcels. Liquor, rice, and masks for facials. Yada yada, we got it all. People come and go, all fulfilled. I'm talented, right? But I'm still missing four words. Help me out. I'm taking annual leave. Are you rushing to go on a bind date? Yeah yeah. So? Four words. 1, 2, 3, 4. 1, 2, 3, 4, we got it all. Thanks Sir, how much for this one? NT$400 a day. NT$400? What about this one? Also NT$400. This one? This one's smaller. Just NT$200. NT$150 No can do. Auntie, give it to me for NT$100. No! My mom uses that to buy groceries. Come on. NT$100 OK OK. Auntie, do you know where this is? No idea. Excuse me. What other post office branches are around here? My luggage! Miss, can you move over a bit? I need to use the ATM. You are embarrassing. What a sleepyhead. Go sleep elsewhere. Sorry "How have you been? It's been another six months." "Thinking about the time we spent together makes me so happy." "Wu Kui-tai" "Post Office" "Secret Base" Is this for real? How far is this place? "This is my last letter to you..." It was only after reading those letters that I remembered him. The Missing Story Grandpa, don't move. Hurry up. Are you done? Grandpa is busy, can't you see? When I was little, people called me "Turtle". Ready... Because I was a step slower in everything. Rock, scissors, paper. Paper Too slow again! Not playing with you anymore. No one liked to play with me. I could never catch mosquitoes. I don't know why, but even my watch was slower. I also discovered that the second hand only starts moving after I look at the clock. There must be some secret. We've all learned how to subtract, right? If the planet was about to explode, Wu Kui-tai would definitely miss the spaceship. Who decided and 60 seconds in a minute? Is a second the same duration for everyone? Earthquake It's gone. Sometimes I wonder if the talking clock service is punking me. 59.9 seconds. I've changed jobs many times. Ended up as a bus driver. Because the bus speed limit is 40km/h. I can take my time. But I still get a lot of complaints. I'm the depot chief and also your uncle. You being so slow makes it hard for me. Speed it up. Time is precious. I don't need to save time. I always feel like time is slower for me. And I'm getting more and more of it. It's like saving money in a post office account. But... I don't go to the post office to save money. No. 66. No. 67 to Counter 8. She probably doesn't remember me. I've known her since I was little. Hi After saying goodbye that time, I didn't see her again until high school. Why did you slam on the brakes? What are you looking at? You have PE class today? Open the door! I'd catch the same bus as her on purpose. Sometimes I'd wait for her after school. She never noticed me. Bye In the second half of 11th grade, I didn't see her for several days. I found the courage to write her a letter. But before I could give it to her, she disappeared... Until last month, when she suddenly reappeared. "Reappeared"” Why did you slam on the brakes? After finding out she works at the post office, I decided to mail her a letter every morning. No. 108 to Counter 8. Pick her up after work at night. Thanks Uncle I want to switch to the afternoon shift. Why? I want to learn English. Learn English? When did you become so motivated? It's my turn now. I went out to buy something and my number passed. You picked it up off the ground. I just saw someone toss it. When did you see me pick it up off the ground? Am I that type of person? I'm a college professor! I didn't say you were any type of person. Hey Keep talking. Keep talking and I'll file a complaint. Please line up. Who are you? Don't push in. Excuse me. Sir What do you need? I'll serve you. I'm going to file a complaint. Sawadee kha! How are you? I want to open an account. No. 87. No. 87. Let's swap. You go first. Thank you. No. 88 to Counter 8. Standard mail, NT$8. Why don't you buy some more stamps? Then you don't have to keep lining up. Just toss them in any mailbox. Thanks "Movie after work tomorrow?" Come on. You really want to roll around in bed all day? It'll kill me! Fine I'll head over now. Love you. Honey Honey, wait wait. Honey, wait wait. What? The lunchbox I made you. You forgot it. Thanks Bye Ouch! Bye I'll wait for you tonight. No. 20 to Counter 7. Thank you. No. 23 to Counter 8. You made it? Thank you. Don't scold me if it's not tasty. I would never. Pick you up after work. Bye No. 24 to Counter 8. Standard mail, NT$8. Oh That... Are you a photographer? Huh? You come in carrying a camera every day. Oh, yes. Mm, yes. Driver, why aren't we moving? Yeah, there's no one boarding. Hurry up. What's going on? Can you just start driving? This driver loves to delay. He's always like this. The engine is overheated. Driving now is dangerous. Huh? You may choose to change buses. We've been waiting for ages. What kind of bad luck is this? It's gonna blow. Everyone off now! Now! Now! Now! Why are you driving off then? Hey Wait up. Do you always walk this fast? I'm just worried the movie's starting. Not yet. Slow down. Follow my rhythm, OK? 1,2, 3,4... 1, 2, 3... slow down! Wait for me. That movie was hilarious. It really was. The lunch you made was delicious. Thank you. You're welcome. What are your plans for Valentine's? Nothing. I've never celebrated Valentine's in my life. You? What are your plans? "Uncle: Where the hell are you? Call me ASAP." Sorry Mate Do you think this is a parking lot? Or do you think your bus is invisible? It's broken. Its invisibility function is broken? Is that it? What are you doing? They're sending someone to fix it. But I've waited a long time already. Show me your license. Oh Ridiculous No. 17. Yes, Sir. Accident on the corner of Xiangyang Road. OK, I'll head over right away. I'll give you 10 minutes. If you're still here when I get back, I'll fine you immediately. OK Let's check the time. Mine is slower. Shut up, or I'll come back in five minutes. OK Sorry Ridiculous Do you think you own the road? Wait! Thank you. Are we really going to compete tomorrow? Isn't a bit ridiculous? Come on, why not? Won't cost us anything. You're really going all out. No I just want to grab the opportunity. The opportunity to help the little girl. What happened there? Thanks I live in this alley. Are you inviting me up? Sure My place is very small and old. Better not. It's OK. I was just kidding. I had a great time today. Uncle: 18 missed calls Wait Thanks Driver Please close the door. We need to take care of some business. Not bad, young man. Quite muscular. No wonder you're popular with the ladies. Hey This is my big sister. She wants to talk to you. Wenson Liu. You said an orphan girl needed a heart transplant and borrowed NT$500,000 from me last time. Has she had the transplant yet? "Hearty" passed away. Really? When did this happen? After you gave me the money, I passed it on immediately to the organ agent. But when we rushed to the hospital, the doctor told me it was a... duck's heart. I was swindled. How could you be so foolish? How many times do you have to be tricked? Listen My sister is an accountant. She worked hard to make that NT$500,000. You could have scammed anyone. But you just had to scam this innocent, honest and beautiful girl. Three days. NT$3 million. Huh? Why NT$3 million? NT$3 million is too much. You... Three days. My sister doesn't like violence. If you don't pay up in three days, I'll make your life miserable. Let's go. My sister doesn't like violence. But I really love violence. I love nothing more than violence. Stop it! Enough! Are you OK? Go! Sis Count yourself lucky. What are you doing? Paying the bus fare. Thugs don't do that! You really should follow the rules. You're embarrassing me. We're gangsters! I'm fine. What? Are you nuts? Who are you? Stop it. My first time and I got through! Hi hi hi. What's your name? My name is Yang Hsiao-chi. Tomorrow is Valentine's Day. What are you plans? Got someone? Yeah, or else I wouldn't be calling. You talk so fast. I'm impatient. So, tell us where you're going tomorrow. I'm going to participate in the Valentine Chemistry Contest. Seems a lot of people are participating. I heard it's quite fun. Is he your husband or boyfriend? How should I put it? I've only known him a few days. You are indeed impatient. You've only known him a few days yet you're spending Valentine's with him. You're under his spell. Not exactly. You should at least like him then. He's a pretty good guy. In what way? Good guy? You're just a con man! He is healthy and likes to exercise. Lunatic! He's honest and kind. Let me tell you, he has really moved me. He's had a very hard life, yet he's still passionate about helping others. Cramp! Cramp! Let me guess. He must be very handsome. He's quite handsome. Let's see how handsome you are! Not the face! Don't scratch my face! And very humorous too. Will this broadcast ever end? I feel like I've accumulated 30 years of happiness, and it's all exploding at once. I never thought happiness could be like a truck charging towards me. OK, happy lady. I hope you win tomorrow. Yes, I will. Thank you. Happy Valentine's, everybody! Thank you. Bye. Bye. Thank you. Who the hell are you? Are you insane? I'm warning you. Leave Yang Hsiao-chi alone. Or else I'll kill you. Lunatic! You're a lunatic! If you don't leave her alone, I'll never leave you alone. NT$1 million. NT$2 million. NT$3 million. Some say life is composed of many memories. Dating is creating memories. You're in their memories, they're in your memories. That is ideal. But your precious memories could also mean nothing to them. That's life. Whether bitter or sweet, single or taken, have a great Valentine's Day tomorrow. Goodnight Hello Hi Hello Hello Is anyone there? Yang Hsiao-chi. I'm going to take you somewhere. My secret base. It's been so long you've probably forgotten. We had a long weekend in fifth grade, remember? My parents drove us down to Taichung for a holiday. There was a multiple car crash. A lot of cars collided. Including the tour bus you were on. My parents died. I was seriously injured. You had a concussion. We stayed in the same hospital room. Remember? I was so sad every day. You kept consoling me. Encouraging me. Can you see? Mm Can you breathe like this? Mm Like this? Mm Does that tickle? Tickles Does that hurt? Hurts Are you almost dead? I don't know. Don't worry, I'll save you. You were discharged first. You said we have to write to each other to see if we've grown up properly. Grow up quickly and become a great person. Good luck, OK? I didn't know where I would be living. I remembered my dad left behind two PO box keys. He rented those PO boxes. I gave you one of the keys. We made a promise to write to each other regularly and post the letters to that PO Box 038. Hsiao-chi, let's go. I'm going now. Bye Remember to write. Good luck. Bye. Bye After you left, I started writing to you. Time passed really slowly. Please, can you mail this for me? After I was discharged, I went to open that mail box. There were 2 letters from you to me. The rest were all from me to you. It made me so happy. But I also realized, you were living so far away. There's no way you could come to open the letterbox. I was so naive back then. I later stopped getting letters from you. But I still kept posting letters and postcards to that mail box. My grandpa lived by the beach up ahead. When I was bored, I'd run here with my dad's camera and take photos everywhere. Thinking about my parents. Thinking that I must go to Taipei to find you one day. Seeing the 30-year-old you made me very happy. Even though you've forgotten me, and though we only spent a few days together in our childhood. But without you, I don't know how I could have made it through that long and difficult period. Waiting to grow up. Waiting to see you again in the future. That was what motivated me to keep going. Thank you. Thank you for always being there for me in my heart. Stopping at Yongan Fishing Harbor? Yes You know her? How come you can move? Why isn't anyone else moving? This is my second time. Second... The world stopped for 24 hours. If you put NT$100 into a bank account each day, after 100 days, how much have you saved? NT$10,000 Wrong There's also interest. Huh? You'd have accumulated interest. You're probably like me. Each day, we get a few more seconds than regular people. After 10, 20 years, we accumulate interest of a full day. Does anyone lose a day? If some can get an extra day, some can a lose a day. That's really how it works? Do you understand a lot about this world? No Me neither. Hsiao-chi That day, I lied and said I was going to buy tofu pudding. Actually, I wanted to find a building and jump off. But, in that moment, something strange happened. The world suddenly stopped. Everyone stopped moving. Only the wind was still blowing. I thought it was very strange. So I didn't jump. I wandered around. If I was tired, I'd lie down in the middle of the road and sleep. I thought, if the world started moving again, I wouldn't mind being run over by a car. After I woke up, I left. I decided to ignore this world. In the 10-plus years since, I worked odd jobs everywhere, traveling, drawing, trying to find myself. Find it? A derailed train is still a train. It can't turn into a plane. So why didn't you go home? I couldn't. You can stop here. Oh Can you help me buy a tofu pudding for her? What topping? Mung bean. Ok Can I take a photo of you two? Happy Valentine's Day. Baby That lady disappeared. Why did it change to old man underpants? So early? Boss, I've got photos to develop. What happened to your face? Handsome, right? Yeah, handsome. Take a seat. I really got an extra day. Today is the real Valentine's Day. I'll give her the final letter and photo tomorrow. It's time to let her go. If I keep this up, I'll become a deviant. She still has a long life ahead of her. She has her own life to live. I should wish her well. Standard mail, NT$8. Oh, it's heavier than usual today. Sorry, needs one more. Thanks Huh? Bye The left side of the banner is lower. "363 Days Later" Hello, Miss. I want to mail this. Hi Ma'am, what is this? Smells pungent. Oh, this? Dried oysters. I'm sending them to my grandson in Taipei. This needs to be sealed. What seal? I don't have a pet seal. No, you need to seal it up. Then package it in a box. Oh, that's so troublesome! Please prepare it at home first. We do sell cardboard boxes here. Sorry. What a hassle! Never in my life have I heard of this seal. I'll post it for you when it's ready. So annoying. Forget it! In his last letter, he said he was leaving to find the life he wants. He hasn't appeared since. So I transferred to Dongshi to see if he'd send any more mail. So moving. How much longer will you wait? Don't know. See if he posts again. It's been a year. Yeah, a year. Hsiao-chi, it's Valentine's again tomorrow. How do you plan to spend it? Mm Skipping it like last year would be pretty good. Better than eating noodle soup alone at home. Don't say that. Being single isn't too bad either. Thanks for sharing your story. No matter what, I still have to wish you a happy Valentine's Day. Be happy. Thank you. Bye Ma'am, I told you yesterday you need to seal this. It's still the same. I didn't expect it to be you again. I thought someone else might let me do it. Fine, I'll do it for you. To this address. OK To Taipei? That's NT$65. All good. You're not a bad person after all. I've always been a good person. Thank you. Bye Bathroom break. Standard mail, NT$8. (To "Mist" Yang Hsiao-chi) So many wrong characters. Someone asked me to give this to you. What is it? Tofu pudding with mung bean. What for? When you finish work, I'll tell you a story. "Love yourself, because someone out there loves you."
