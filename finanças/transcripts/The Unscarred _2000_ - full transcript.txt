Yeah! Johann. They're both going to be sick. OK, guys, what do you say? Keep going. Sorry, Raf. That's not funny, Travis. Don't blame me. Johann started all these. Oh, don't blame it on the Wienerschnitzel. Come on, why don't you quit so Raf and I can go off and settle this. And don't be ridiculous. Rafaella doesn't go for the dumb, obnoxious type. Oh. Oh. You know what, you both grow up. The victor no spoils. Yeah! Yeah! Amazing. During the season, he doesn't touch a drop, now look at him. And the baseball star is not in the field tonight. 385, average batting championship, I will beat your ass on any field, rich boy. Come on. OK. Let's go again. OK, guys, after second. Money's on Mickey. Yeah! Yeah! My Rafaella, darling, you look absolutely stunning when you're annoyed. Let's go loser. No stalling the inevitable. You know, this is childish. You guys promised to take me home hours ago. I'm leaving. Ciao. Raf, wait a minute. Mickey, as the responsible one, I really should save you and your liver by declaring myself the winner. Raise your glass. Come on. Johann, explain to him. Oh, come on. Your old man [audio out] out of this one. You quit, you lose. Actually, it's you snooze, you lose. Hey, Rafaella. [laughs] And you just lost, sucker. Thank you. Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you. What? No, please, please, you're too kind. Thank you. Oh, bull fucking shit. Man, you cheated. That's not fair. Come on, sit the fuck down. Let's finish this. To late, Mick. Love is in the air. I said sit down. Relax, Mick. It's just a fucking game. Somebody wins. Somebody loses. No one gives a fuck. You are right. Who gives a shit. [cheering] Come on. [interposing voices] This is one bet you're going to lose. I really don't want to have to hurt you, Mick. [cheering] Come on, [inaudible]. Get up. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. Now it's over. Whoa. Pay up suckers. I'll decide when it's over. [screams] Mickey. Oh shit. Somebody call an Ambulance. [music playing] Yeah, give me Cincinnati and Atlanta 10. Right. Cleveland and Toronto at 5. Give me Saint Louis and Chicago at 10. Who's pitching for Chicago? Yeah, give me 10, Mickey. Yeah. No. No. And San Francisco and LA, put 5 down on the first game. No, I don't want the second game. Just the first. 5. Right. Who's pitching for the Mets tonight? No. No. Just give me 10 on the Yankees. Look, I'll make the bet. You just place them. Right. Where are you going to be later. No, I'll give you a call. Right. [background chatter] [music playing] Hey, [inaudible]. What do you want? [inaudible], wants to see you. What does he want? How the fuck should I know? Hey, sport. Where have you been? I've been trying to reach you. I tried to call you Tuesday night. Tuesday? You don't got my cell number? No. I'll have to give it to you. Anyway, I heard you took the Yankees over Boston today. Where did you hear that? I got to tell you that's a sucker bet because Cohn's got nothing left. What is this? This must be a mistake, Mickey. Because this ain't even covering the bet. You know you're up to 90k now, sport. That ain't playing money. What are we going to do about this? Tommy, if you could just wait... Wait? I'm a man who doesn't like to wait. I'm into kind of like immediate gratification. You know what I mean? Yeah, like a baby. Yeah. That's it. Like a baby. You know I've been telling Dougie Fingers for a week now not to take any more action from you. And this morning, what do I find? I find that he's been taking action from you. Kind of... It's not your fault. It's his. He disobeyed. Never placed a bet with that prick. Let me show you something. I don't think your bet went through today. All right, Mickey. Here's the deal. This thing ain't squared by early next... Call it, Tuesday. All bets are off. You know what I'm saying? You're going to pull this shit on me after all these years? One thing ain't got nothing to do with the other. Tuesday is end game. We ain't settled up by then, well, there's a lot of things that could happen. Tuesday, sport. [inaudible] [music playing] Travis, did you reach him? Oh, for Christ's sake's. How many times have I asked you for a favor? Yeah, is Brannam in there? When is he coming back? Is your daddy there? Shit. That's absolute bullshit. Your daddy. You owe me that money for six months you little prick. Put him on the phone. Because I want it now. The what? Is your mommy there? I'm telling you I need it by tomorrow. Put your mommy on the phone. Covered your ass on a bet you fat fuck. Cock sucker. But what? If I come down there I'll reap your right... Richie cheap motherfucker. No, Carol. It's a business opportunity that's just popped up. No, it's nothing like that. Just need a few dollars. I'll get it back in a couple of months. I promise. Right. Right. Right. Right. [music playing] No, I understand. I understand. Hello, Mickey. It's a weird delay. Jesus Christ, is that you, Moore? Yeah, it's Travis. What the hell time is it? It's 11 o'clock. So what the hell's going on, buddy? I don't know. You called me chief. You won't believe where I am. I have no idea. Berlin. Berlin? Yeah, I'm in Berlin. I'm standing here with Johann. Johann Holt? Yeah. How is that Kraut son of a bitch? He's good. He's good. He's good. I was over here on business. I haven't seen him in shit so long. Anyway, I just dropped in. I have the address with me. Yeah, why not. Unbelievable. So when are you coming to join us? Come over there? Yeah, we want to see you. Yeah, I'll have my pilot refuel the jet. I'll be right over. Look, I'm serious. We're serious. It's been 20 years, Mick. We want to see you. Here I am hanging out with Johann in Germany like I've never been away. So come over. Close the circle, old times, and all that bullshit. I can't come over there. I got too much business here. Ticket is on me. Still quick with the checkbook, huh? Come on, Mickey. We want to see you. It's been too long. Everybody is hear. Me, Johann, Raf. Come on. We'll have a blast. [music playing] Hey. You look great. Mickey. Look at you. Hey, look at you. Give us your bag. Hey, welcome. Long time, huh. So how was your flight? Yeah, I could use some sleep. I'll bet. It's unbelievable. This place hasn't changed in 20 years. This is probably the only place you'll recognize around here, Mick. Mickey, there it is. The last time you saw that there was a wall in front of it, remember. Unbelievable. So this is the East? Yeah. I always wondered what this place looked like. A wall comes down, another goes up. People don't change. How's Rafaella? Oh, she's fine. Should be at the house. She won't be around much this weekend. I think she's babysitting her niece and nephew. At least, at night. I'm not sure. How's the kid? Off at Stanford. Just like us. Studying in the States for summer session. He'll be 20 years old in two months. So how about your wife, Mickey? What was her name? Which one? Number one or number two? I'm not sure. Neither am I. What about your wife? What was her name, Lori? Lauren, yeah. Yeah, that's over too. Too bad. What about the kids? Well, it's a long story. I mean, I don't get to see them as much as I'd like but it is what it is, you know? I hear that. It looks like the rebuilding the whole city. Yeah, almost. A few years you won't recognize this place. And you got a piece of all this, huh? It's been a good year. I got a contract to design a new building for the Stadt's Bibliotech. What's that? A library. A library? Yeah. You never saw the inside of a library in school. [laughter] I told you. It's amazing. You won't believe it. The nightclubs. The parties. The women. Everything's open all night. It's an exciting time right now. Tell him. Johann. He's right. It is. I'm thinking of getting a place here myself. Berlin's going to be the New York of Europe. Just what we need, another New York. [laughter] Welcome to my home. It looks like Jersey. Be patient, Mick. Things aren't what they seem. I used my contacts to grab this place before anyone imagined it was livable. This way, Mickey. This used to be a metal works factory for the GDR. They used to move lead through here. Temperatures right. So welcome to my wine cellar. Come. I redesigned it from the ground up, putting in all new plumbing, wiring. It works. It wasn't easy getting past all the bureaucracy. But what the government doesn't know won't hurt them, right? We spent seven years fixing and repairing it. Taking out the machines and the equipment. Putting in the floors, the gallery. Raf and I did most of it on our own as much as we could anyway. From the outside no one knows we're here. You might say it's our own secret hideaway. Unbelievable. Hey, Mick, grab a shower. We're going out, yeah? We got two nights to tear the city down. Where can I wash up? You are up here on the left. Now got and get clean so we can go and get dirty, yeah. Sounds good. [music playing] Are they here? Yes, they are inside. How are they? They seem fine. How are you? I'm fine. Everything's fine. I'll be done in a minute. That feels good. When are you going out? In a little while. Where are you taking them? An Indian restaurant. Mickey hates Indian food. I know. [laughter] So what do you think? Some place. Yeah, he knows where he's been. Mickey, you are sure, no drink? Maybe later. Cheers. [music playing] Hello, Michael. Look at you, as beautiful as ever. How are you? I'm good. And you? I'm good to. Well, who would have ever thought we'd all be together like this again, huh? It's been a long time. Well, we should get going or we miss our reservation. Are you joining us? No. I'm going to my sister's. But you all have fun. And Travis, don't get into too much trouble. Bring my husband back home safely. [non-english speech]. Mickey, this way. We take the street entrance. Hey, guys. This way. [chatter] Come on, guys. [music playing] Let's have a drink at the bar. Hey! Hey. Hey, you. Oh, hey. Fucking zoo in here, uh. Fucking not enough. OK, here we go gentlemen. 1, 2, it's called the shotgun. Pill on the tongue, drink, bang. Hey, come on it's the Millennium. Don't tell me you're too old for the next century. It's been too long. We should have done this years ago. I know. Good to see you man. Good to see you. I want you to meet somebody. Actually, some buddies. Come on. This is Catherine and Anke. Ladies, Travis and Mickey, my friends. How are you doing? Good. I get some more drinks. Hi. Hi. Hi. So you want to dance? Oh, I'm really not a good dancer. Oh, come on. We go dancing. Come on. That was pretty fast. Too fast. It's just I've been out of the game for a long time. Welcome back. I really can't dance. You're going to dance. What was your name again? What? Your name. Munich. But I've been here for three years. Your English is excellent. I studied in New York for one year. I studied in Berlin like 1,000 years ago, but I can't remember any German. Has anyone ever told you that you're not bad looking. Oh, thank you. Hey, how is your friend enjoying Berlin? Excuse me. Here, Mick. I see he hasn't lost his touch. Yes, some things don't change. So everything's fine with you in the States? Yeah. Travis told me you work in a factory. Yeah. What do you do? I'm a machinist. What's that? I work on machines. Get one more. In a minute. Be comfortable. It's fantastic. Did you make this? No, it's prefabricated. You can make it, right? Yeah. Anyone for a nightcap? Yeah. [inaudible] Mickey, what will it be? Bed. Got to get some sleep. Things change, huh? Mickey is always the last man down. You OK? Yeah. Are you tired? No. You want to go home? No. Let's sit down. [chuckles] [music playing] I had a feeling you guys would get along. We can stop whenever you want. No, I like this. So my kissing is good. We don't have to hurry. I'm just a little nervous. Just kiss me. Just a minute. [screaming] Fuck. What the hell was that? What happened? Mickey. What happened? We were just on our way to bed and the railing just collapsed. Jesus Christ. Oh my God. I think she's really dead. What the fuck is going... Holy shit. Jesus. What happened? What happened? We were barely... she just fell back and down. What were those fucking pills? Nothing. Downers, that's all. Mickey, what am I going to do? She's dead. What the fuck happened? Did you have an argument? Were you kidding around? I don't know we were just... We were kissing, that's all. What, you were humping her against the railing? It's a strong railing. It's not that strong. So what does that mean? It means it wasn't a strong railing. We have to call the cops. Tell them what? And tell them it was an accident. The sooner we call them the better. No. Not until we exactly find out what happened. You can't call the cops. Why not? Why not? Because you got a drugged out dead girl here. Two millionaires and an American. That's why. He's right. But it was an accident. What if the police don't believe it was an accident? Huh? What are you going to do then? It's criminal liability. He built this place illegally. The railing breaks. The next thing... That's enough with the fucking railing. You call the cops and you'll be building your library in prison. Fuck you. Use your head. I'm sorry, Johann. Sorry shit. We're all in this now. And I'm not going to fucking jail. I feel sick. So what are you going to do, chief? I don't know. Truly, I don't know. No. Don't touch anything. Leave her alone. Look how he is. Go on. [coughing] Mickey, we got to talk. I don't think I can go through with this. I don't think you have a choice. Wait, what are you doing? Mickey, help me get her into the lift. We put her in the wine cellar for now. Johann, she's a person. Her name is Anke. I know who she is. The problem is what she is. I'm not going to pretend that this didn't happen. Shut up, Travis. Shut the fuck up. Let's go. Well it's heavier than she looked. Just pull it open. Go check on him. I'm afraid he's going to do something stupid. Well, that wouldn't surprise me. Shit. What is it? You forgot this. And this. Give it to me. Shit. What is it? I have to replace the table. Where the hell are you going to find a table? I'll get one at the place where I bought it. They are open? Yeah, in about one hour. Oh, shit. What am I going to tell Raf. What if she comes home, calls? I'll go get it. Where is this place? It's near zoo station. I'll give you the address and cash. Travis, you come with me. Watch it. You got it? Yeah. I don't know where the hell we are now. She was just 20. Enough with the girl. Just give me directions. Oh, no. Oh, shit, we're in Kreuzberg. How the hell did we get there? Here. Go. Left. Now, left. Go. Go. [honking] You take it easy. You're going to kill somebody. Christ, you haven't changed. What was that Romanian girl's name? Remember the one you knocked up. She wanted to marry you. You took off. I had to convince her to get an abortion. What the hell was her name? Torella. Right, Torella, good fuck. Will you please slow down. Mickey, watch out. [honking] What are you doing? Shit, do you have any cigarettes? No, I stopped. We've got to talk. About what? Some things have been bothering me for a while. And what's that? Ever since the accident... Oh, Jesus Christ. Why do you have... Ever since you fucked up my arm... What is it, Mickey? I'm not paying you enough? I didn't say that. You're generous. Yeah, I'd say the $40,000 a year is generous. I paid for your surgery. For your expenses. I paid for everything... But why the fuck do you have to bring up then? $40,000 a year. Yeah, $40,000 a year is not bad. But I could have had a multi million dollar baseball contract. You never even tried to do anything with your life. You just pissed it away on all season baseball. It's not your fucking business what I do. What do you want from me? $100,000 cash ends it. Ends what? I forget the past. I forget last night. What are you talking about? The dead girl. [chuckles] You got to be kidding me. You still think the police will believe it's an accident? It's the truth. Not if I saw you push her off, it's not. You wouldn't do that. I wouldn't, huh? $100,000, it's over. They'll never believe you. I think they will. You want to take that chance? Don't forget Johann and Rafaella go down to. You are a fucking bastard, you know that? You could have just asked me for the money. Do we have a deal or not? Yeah, we have a deal. Good. Where do we go? Here, take this left. What the hell do they want? Shit, we're a one way street. Don't do anything crazy. Just let me handle it. [knock on window] Come on. [non-english speech] Driver's license, registration, please. See if there is a registration in there? [non-english speech] Wrong street. [non-english speech] Please, just step out of the car. Please, just step out of the car. I heard you the first time. What are you... What are you doing? We need to stop. Mickey. Do you believe it? Slow down. Slow down. [siren blaring] Fucking insane. Man, slow down. Slow the fuck down. You're fucking mad, man. Slow it down. Why don't you calm down. Stop. Slow down, will you? Will you fucking slow down. You're going... shit. No You see them? It doesn't matter. They got our plate number. How far are we from the house? Close. Take this next right. It's over, Mickey. I'll decide when it's over. Jesus, what took you so long? We're in trouble, Johann. The cops. What do you mean the cops? Hey, don't fuck me. The cops? We got pulled over and he took off. What happened, Mickey? It was nothing. Oh, fuck. Is Rafaella coming home? Yeah, sure. She can't be here. She can't come here. Oh, yeah, good. Then you call her. Tell her that she can't come to her own house. Tell her about the girl and the body. Mickey, tell me about the god damn police? [door bell ringing] Ask them yourself. Shit. You go upstairs. Keep out of sight, now. What are you going to do? Shut the fuck up. [door bell ringing] What are they saying? I don't know. Huh? I don't know. It's got to be someone from the club last night. Here? He's looking for the girl. What are they saying? [non-english speech] Mickey, Travis. Who the hell is that? It's the bartender from last night. He's looking for his sister. Jesus. He found some broken glass on the floor. What did you do? I panicked. Now, what are we going to do? We got to get rid of her. Is there any of that tape left? Yeah. Yeah. In the kitchen. I'll get it. Here it is. [door bell ringing] Shit, the cops. Put him upstairs. Hurry up. [music playing] Shit. Jesus. They don't sound happy down there. What did they say? [mumbling] Jesus, what you do that... He had no business coming here to begin with. What are you saying now? There is no getting out of this. Why don't you just stop it. They don't have shit. They need a search warrant, don't they? This is Germany, not the US. They can do whatever they want. Shit, this has gone too far. Let's just tell them. What? Let's just tell them what's happened. Let's tell them the truth. I'm going to fucking jail because of you. Don't fucking move. I'll bust your fucking head open. Mickey, Travis. What the fuck is going on here? They leave? Yeah. He hit him. What? You're something, you know that? Mickey, you shit. They suspect anything? Of course, wouldn't you? Why did they leave? I told them there was a mistake. That my car was in the carport. Doesn't make sense. I told them it was stolen. I had to file a goddamn report. Fuck that. Do it tomorrow. I intend to. What if they're watching the house? They're not going to watch the house over a stolen car. What are we going to do about this guy in here? Nothing. Now where are we going to dump the girl? I don't know. Maybe... maybe the channel. Tie them up with bricks, ropes, something like that. Sink to the bottom. I don't know, this is crazy. I don't like it. You haven't liked anything so far. Yeah, that's because what we're doing is wrong. It's evil. What's wrong is us going to prison because you fucked it up. How hard were you fucking her to the banister? I told you, she leaned against it and she fell. It wouldn't break from only leaning somebody. That's all I was fucking doing. Knock it off. We're wasting time. Yeah, that's right. [music playing] Wait a minute. Mickey, what the hell are you doing? Come on. Are you fucking crazy? You want this lying around? [inaudible] I saw how you took care of it. What the fuck was that? Shit. Wait here. What are you doing? What are you doing? Wait here. Is there another way upstairs? I don't know. What do you think he's going to do. [gun shot] No. He came at me, Mickey. Somehow he got free and came at me. I only wanted to scare him. I even didn't pull the trigger. This thing went off by itself. I only wanted to scare him. You all right? Give me this before you hurt yourself. My God, what have I... You had no choice. He would have went right to the cops. Go downstairs. Go downstairs. Mickey, get the girl in the car. I'll clean up the mess. Give me the gun. What? Give me the gun, Mickey. It's a murder weapon. We have to ditch it along with the bodies. No loose ends. Give me the gun. Let's go. Mickey, I need you to come with me. Come here. This guy is ready to crack. You leave him here alone, he's going to call the cops. We killed a kid. You see. It's over. It is horrible and I can't even say it. I knew him. He was a good kid. That's it. No more. I can't believe this. [chuckles] What's wrong, Moore? This is how you got through life. You never cared who you fucked in the past. Why care now? Because I made mistakes when I was younger, Mickey. I'm a different person now. Come on, let's go. I know the place. It's a factory. I designed it. It's by a bridge. It's traffic. It's noise. It's perfect. Jesus Christ, I can't believe myself. I won't do it. And you can't make me do it either. Maybe you'd like to join them? Yeah, maybe. Well, that can be arranged. Stop. God damn it. Stop it for one second. We're supposed to be friends. We came here to do something. Not this. That's me, over finished with. Fucking pussy. God, damn you. God, damn you, Mickey. Come on. Stop. Can I trust you? I know this is madness. But we're in too far. I need to trust you. You really want to go through with this? I would prefer not to but what choice do we have? Then show me that you're certain? Look me in the eyes and tell me that? Because this is our way out now. Let's go. Shut up. Johann, tell me. I'll listen to you either way. Let's do it. Let's do it. Mickey, you wait here. Travis and I get rid of the bodies. No, fucking way. We all go. I want someone for when Rafaella's coming home. I'd rather not leave Travis alone right now. You're going to be able to control him? Travis, let's go. [music playing] Johann. Johann. Michael, I wasn't expecting you. Where's my husband? They went for a drive. When will they be back? I have no idea. No. It's been a long time since me and you have been alone together. I'm getting dressed. Can you leave me alone. We have to talk. Let me get dressed first then we can talk. I want you to leave, now. Let's go. You look like you're going to be sick. I'm worried, Johann. There are too many loose ends. It's going to catch up with us. No, it won't. Just remember what's at stake, focus on that. We can do it. Everything will be fine if we can only hold it together. Let's go. Come on. Rafaella, should be home by now. Is this Alex? Where did you get that? I think he has your eyes. Michael, don't do this. What if I told you that I want to see him? What? What if I told you that I want him to know who his real father is? God, damn you. Why? Alex is a beautiful boy. Why do you want to hurt him? I don't want to hurt anybody. Then why would you do that now? Because I think he should know his real father is. We had an agreement. I pay you $10,000 a month to stay away from him. Not to come to Berlin for a visit. I was invited, remember. Alex was never to know who you are. That was the deal. Yeah, that was the deal. But now I want to see him. All of a sudden. You could never be a father to him. But Johann can, huh? Yes. He's a good father. He's a loving father. A loving father and a murderer. What are you talking about? Let me tell you a little bedtime story about the loving father. Travis picked her up at the bar and brought her back to the house. I went to bed. I heard a scream. The next thing I know a girl is dead lying in a pool of blood. It was your husband's idea to wrap the body and dump it somewhere. I wish you could have seen your husband and Travis, the way they wrapped the girl up in that plastic. Very meticulous. Check the date on that receipt. [music playing] I heard something upstairs. I open the door, your husband put the gun to the kid's head and pulled the trigger just like that. Not even blinking. I tried to stop them, but they wouldn't listen to me. That's where they are now. Getting rid of the body. You like that story. Brother and sister dead. Just like that. What do you think of the loving father now? I don't believe you. I think you do. It's no use, Michael. You can't make me hate my husband. I already hate you too much. $100,000 cash. US, not Deutschmarks and I disappear forever. Husband stays out of jail and the kid can go on believing the fucking fairy tale you told him. The day will come where you will have to pay for all the things you do to people. Yeah, well, until that day comes just get me the fucking money, all right. Let me go. Do you know why you hate me so much because you are just like me. I'm nothing like you. Mickey. Mickey. Any problems? No, it's done. What was done? We went to get some vegetables for dinner. Did you get some bread, Johann? We shouldn't have left him alone. He's fine. He opens his mouth we're fucked. What are you talking about? It's all going according to plan. He can't be trusted. First chance he gets he's going to run to the police. Travis won't do that. He won't, huh? So what are you suggesting we do? I don't know. What do you think we should do? I just hate the fact that they think that I've abandoned them. And God only knows what Lauren tells them when I'm not there. Give it some time. Once the children are older, they will see it all in a different light. Yeah, maybe you are right. I just never thought the breakup would be as acrimonious as it has been. The thing of it is that I tried to make it work. I mean, I really tried. I don't know. Maybe I never really loved her. I don't think I ever loved anyone as much as I loved you. So by the time I got there [inaudible].. So what did you guys do last night? What did we do? What did we do? This is just... we just hung out. Are you still painting? What was it, watercolors? Mostly etching now. I like the way the ink sinks into the grooves. Just like blood. I don't think I'll ever get my fingertips clean. Travis, you don't seem to be yourself tonight. Me, why do you say that? You look frightened. No, no. It's just maybe I was just thinking a little bit. What are you most frightened of? What am I most frightened of? What do you mean? What a strange question, Bela. He doesn't have to answer. I just was wondering. What are you afraid of? A lot of things. There is the sound that one of the shadows makes in the wind. It bangs against the windows and I just think for one second that my whole world is coming apart. You never said anything. I don't know why. I just thought of it. I'll fix it in the morning. I'll take it down. No, that's not it. It's OK to be that scared because I reach out and you're there. And it all goes away. Jesus Christ. Why don't you stop it. Don't you ever feel anything, Michael? No. I had that cut out of me a long time ago. So anyone for coffee? Yeah, I'll take one. Mickey? Raf? When are you going to tell me what you did? What do you mean? This bartender you shot. Jesus, Trav. I leave you alone one hour. Mickey told me. Why did you fucking open your mouth? Why did you shoot him? Tell me. I panicked. It was an accident. To begin with it was an accident and it was my fault. Where are the bodies? Johann, I love you. That will never change. Now, where are the bodies? We decided to put them in the river. In the river? We tied them up with bricks and rope for sinking. Do you think that's enough to keep them down? Are you all crazy. Those bodies will rise. The tide or the boats could loosen them up. Rope will rot. What are you talking about? They still have air in the lungs. Air pockets in their clothing. They were wearing clothing, weren't they? Unless they're tied down with something more permanent, cement or chains, eventually they will float to the surface. She's right. How's that? It's simple physics, Michael. One mistake and we all go down. God damn it. Did anyone see you? Do you know exactly where you dumped them? Yes. Right at the old barge at the Bahala factory. We have to fish them out. What? We can fill the car with bricks and some chains. And we need something to fish them out with. We have to hurry. Raf, I'm so sorry. So am I. Let's go. Hey, just a moment. Just remember what I said. You better get your ass down at that bank first thing in the morning. I don't want to stay in this goddamn place any longer than I have to. Hey, Mickey. You know how when you were a kid, when you are standing beside a merry go round. It looked like it was moving so slow that you could just reach out your hand and slide right up onto a horse. We're almost done, Travis. I promise. But it's not. It's all moving too fast and you get yanked down. You cannot pull yourself back up. But you're afraid to let go. Jesus Christ, you don't know when to stop, do you? Get the chains. Let's make sure they came up first. I don't see a goddamn thing. Just turn around. What are you doing? Cleaning up. I wore gloves. You picked up the pieces with your bare hands. What the hell are you talking about? Your fingerprints are everywhere, Mickey. Very sloppy. You took the gun, the murder weapon, and put your prints all over it you arrogant bastard. That wasn't even part of the plan. The elevator camera only films the back of the lift. You're the only one on this tape. On Friday night I left the club and dropped my wife in the country. It was a wonderful night, wasn't it honey? At the house while Travis was passed out, you made a play for Anke, as is your nature. And the poor girl paid with her life. While I slept you cleaned up, hid the body, and then laid in wait. The brother arrived. You shot him and came here to dispose of the bodies. They're not here, are they? They are somewhere safe just in case. In case of what? Huh? What are you going to kill me? No, Michael. We are here to give you a choice. Oh, yeah. What's that? Raf told me about Alex half a year ago. You son of a bitch. It's a ticket home to New Jersey. Use it. Here's your stuff. You're going to need it. What if I tell the police the truth? Who do you think they will believe? Works out perfectly for every one. You get to live. We get you out of our lives forever. You're a parasite, Mickey. You didn't know when to stop. And if you ever try to contact Alex, I will kill you as you stand. Let's go. Travis, you drive. OK, Mickey. Your choice. Through that gate is freedom, your life. Or you stick around here and go to jail forever. So... To us. To life. To death. Hey, look who is here? Hi. Hi. The dead. So did it work? Of course, it worked. It was my plan. It worked to perfection. Did he really believe it? [music playing] [screams] I have to admit. I really like the kissing part. Yeah, that was pretty good. How about a sequel? I always like sequels. You know that ass hole really hit me. Sorry about that, Chris. [inaudible] for 20 years. Never again. I still don't know what I'm going to do with the police. I have to hide it in the street somewhere. I hope they find it. You better hope they return it. But your car is worth getting Mickey out of our lives. How about the look on his face when he saw the gun on him. I almost laughed out loud. [chuckles] And that was worth 20 years of his shit. I'm glad [inaudible]. Bye. Bye. See you. I guess I'll see you. See you later. Hey, I'm going to grab a shower. Hey, Travis. No, no, you cannot do this. Just give me five minutes for now. We haven't even started celebrating? Oh, hey man. [music playing] You are out of wine. I'll get you some more. No, I'll get it. No, you're too drunk. You'll fall on your face. Besides I have better taste. Your taste [inaudible] can mix [inaudible].. Raf, is everything all right down there? [breathing heavily] I'm coming. Mickey, what are you doing, man? Sit down. Put the fucking knife down. I said sit down. Enough fucking games. I want $100,000 cash and I want it now. Let Rafaella go, Mickey. You're not going to get anything like that. I swear to Christ, I will cut her fucking throat. I can get that kind of money now. Everything is closed. Whatever you've got this goddamn fucking house, cash, jewelry, I want it now. Hey [inaudible]. Sit down. I said sit down. Where is Moore? He's not here. Moore. He is not here, Mickey. Put the fucking gun down. Did you think I was just going to get on a plane and have you frame me for murder and forget about it. They're not dead. The fuck are you talking about? The girl, Anke, she's not dead. The bartender is not dead. He's not even her brother. They're actors. They're still alive, Mickey. Shit. It was a play. A play to get you out of our lives. He's telling the truth. Shut up. Sit down. I'll call them. [gun shot] The next one goes in her fucking head. Man, man, calm down. Let's talk this through. Sit down. [inaudible] Mother fucker. [gun shot] Mother fucker. Raf. No. You stupid fucking son of a... It was me. It was my fault, me. Leave them alone. I told them it was a game. You stupid fuck. A harmless way to get rid of you. And now it's over. Please go home. Fucking useless animal. [echoing chatter] [music playing]
