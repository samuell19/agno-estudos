"Osaka, 1994" It's a man. Hey! Are you okay? Aren't you the guy from upstairs? Hey. Hey! Ambulance... Mister? Could you please... take me to the Shogi Hall? What? Wait. Don't fall out! Please hurry. I'm running late. All right. "Shogi Hall" To the right. Over there. Here you are. Are you okay? Excuse me. Who was that guy? "Ryu-oh Tournament: Tanaka versus Murayama" Murayama Satoshi, rank seven. You have the first move. "Satoshi - A Move For Tomorrow" "Satoshi - A Move For Tomorrow" Murayama? It's me, Egawa. I'm coming in. Hey. Seriously? You aren't even dressed yet? We need to hurry. Is this suit okay? Not on the shogi board again. You will earn the Shogi God's wrath for this. I'm merely making shogi a part of my life. Shogi God would be pleased. Stop talking and get changed. He did it. —Who? —Habu won the Meijin Tournament. "Habu Yoshiharu went against the great Yonenaga Kunio." "In game six of the seventh match at the 52nd Meijin Tournament" "Habu took the game on his 86th move." "He won four games out of the six, and got his first Meijin title." "He has now won five out of the seven titles in professional shogi." "The shogi world welcomes a shot of new blood" "in the form of an army of young geniuses dubbed the 'Habu Generation'." "We have Moriuchi Toshiyuki, Sato Yasumitsu and Goda Masataka from Tokyo." "From Osaka, we have Murayama Satoshi." "The giant who aims to beat them all." They are calling you the giant from Osaka. An army? That sounds ridiculous. All right. We're running out of time. Three more pages. Come on. You're the star today. "Murayama Satoshi Promotion Celebration" Satoshi has advanced to rank seven. I'd like to thank you again for all of your support. It all began 10 years ago. Mrs Murayama came to me asking me to take her fourteen-year-old son as my pupil. It feels like just yesterday when they came knocking on my door. Right, Mrs Murayama? Yeah. Time goes by so quickly. Where's Satoshi? I heard he's on his way. This is bad. I think everyone has cottoned on to it. Satoshi is late so I'm trying to buy some time here. I'm just a third-rate shogi master. I get this a lot. Finally! Rescue Mr Mori from behind the lectern. Murayama! My pupil's poor timing is making me sweat bullets. What took you so long? Did you have a fever? I was in the middle of a manga. Really? You've got to be kidding me. Anyway, go on. Without further ado, let's hear from Murayama Satoshi. Hello, I'm Murayama Satoshi. Somehow I made it to rank seven. It took me a year too long. I wasted too much time. But I'm not unhappy. I honestly don't know how I managed to get here. But I know the fight has just begun. —From here on... —Egawa. It's nice to see you. How's your tournament score? Eight wins, four loses. It's going all right. How old are you? I'm 23. Then it's not going all right for you. You only have three more years to become a professional. We need another of Mori's pupils in the professional ranks. That's what our club wants! For the next three years, it's do or die. Buck up, all right? I don't need you to tell me that. Lastly I'd like to thank Mr Mori, my parents and my doctor, Dr Yamamoto. As you may know, my teacher is only a third-rate shogi master. The only things he taught me were how to drink and play mahjong. That's Mr Habu. The new Meijin sure is charismatic. Are you feeling okay? Sakata Karen? Here. Yamazaki Yoshitake? Here. Please go for your match. —Takahashi Shinji? —Move the king. Nakashima Akihiko? —Please go for your match. —Okay. "Osho Tournament: Murayama versus Habu" It's time, Murayama. Please make the first move. —Let's have a good game. —Let's have a good game. He's aiming for a mate. But his opponent is Habu. He will see through Satoshi's moves. Thirty seconds. Forty seconds. Fifty seconds. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven... Fifty seconds. One, two, three, four, five, six... I admire his precision in the game's final moments. Forty seconds. Fifty seconds. One, two, three, four, five, six... I've lost. On his 126th hand, five-title holder Habu wins. I got a little worried halfway through. I didn't expect your pawn strike to 8-C. What about the knight move? It's nephrosis. Nephrosis? It's a kidney disorder where proteins leak into the urine. Symptoms include water retention, fatigue, fever, shortness of breath and low blood pressure. In the worst case scenario, he may have difficulty passing urine. His blood could clot which could be fatal. Mrs Murayama. Yes? Why didn't you bring him in sooner? This illness can't be cured, your son will have to live with it for life. Your negligence has made things worse. You need to be in bed or the fever could get worse. —No. —Satoshi! I don't want to! Hey, Satoshi. I bought you something. Look. Checkmate! Darn! One more game! One more! Yes! I've won three times in a row! Three wins! How is he? That game really took a toll on him. Can you check my temperature? I'll die if it goes above 40ºC. It's 39.2ºC. You won't die just yet. Mr Mori? I'm going to Tokyo. What? I'm going to Tokyo where I can play shogi around Habu. It's now or never. I'll beat Habu and win the title of Meijin. Oh no. The fever got to his head. You're in no condition to say that. Who's going to take care of you in Tokyo? I think that's a great idea. Mr Mori? Egawa, I told you I like the beef bowls from Yoshinoya. It has to be from Yoshinoya. Miniyon for cream puffs, Mitchan for okonomiyaki, and Tokugawa for katsudon. They're the best in their field. Right, Mr Mori? You're right. All right. Ouch, my back... Don't strain yourself, Mr Mori. I'm fine. You know what? Satoshi is the only pupil who would make his master pack for his move. Oh... I found it. "Payment for August" I can't believe he still has these. He cherishes these more than anything else. Mr Hashiguchi from the Federation will take care of him in Tokyo. You have nothing to worry about. Thank you. It's getting really cold. Yeah. The latest volume of "Playful Kiss" that I pre-ordered... We don't have it in yet. I don't need it anymore. You found a copy? No. I'm moving to Tokyo. Really? That's amazing. That will be 460 yen. You should be able to get a copy easily enough in Tokyo. In areas like Jimbocho. Not that I've been there before. If you ever come back, please visit us again. Sure, I will. "Second-hand Bookstore" "Sendagaya Station" Hey, Murayama! I found several apartments within walking distance to the Shogi Hall. I hope one of them will be to your liking. Hashiguchi, this is my bankbook and my seal. I was told to give you my important documents. Okay... Find me in the editorial department if you need these. Oh, I need you to fill out a survey for our shogi yearbook. Oh. Do I really have to fill one out? Everyone does. Oh. I don't see the point of it. It's not about having a point or not. Oh. This is nice. I'm not staying beside a graveyard. Here it is. What's wrong? These stairs... Too much? When I'm sick, yes. How is it? Come in. Oh, I think this apartment is for women. I've always wanted to live in a fancy apartment with a security camera. Really? It doesn't suit you. Well, I think it does. —This is a little unusual. —Don't worry. This will look like home soon enough. Are you sure? Don't worry. "Shogi Hall" That's Murayama Satoshi. The one from Osaka. So, this goes here... Hey, he's staring at us. Should we talk to him? We'll only be a bother to him. As I was saying, the gold... The gold is here, then push a pawn here... He took the silver. Take the silver on 7-I. Then push the bishop to 3-E. That would be a mate. But if you drop the gold on 6-H followed by the rook and the knight, you still can't have a mate. I see. A combination move with the bishop will win this game. I prefer this move. But if this goes here... So it's the rook... Which means move your rook to 3-H. I dodge. Next is gold. —I escape. —Here's my next move. King takes it. Promote the rook. I escape. I drop the silver. Knight takes the square. Follow by... I see. Retreat then drop the pawn. There's still a chance. There is? I can't read ahead. Murayama? What do you think? I would like to hear your opinion. Mate it. How? Mate it. Are you sure? Don't patronise us. Hey! Tell me how to mate it. Hey. How can you not mate it? You lost fair and square, Arazaki. You don't know that yet. They're still playing. That's not the point. You drink too much and your nails are filthy. You know what? You have to aim for the top. —Another one. —Sure. We all want to be the best. Any fool can want it. The key is knowing how to achieve it. The noodles here in Tokyo are awful. Say what? Especially the udon noodles. That's what everyone from Osaka says. You should try soba noodles... Folks in Tokyo are an unfriendly lot. Nobody spoke to me until you showed up, Mr Tachibana. Well, our young pupils are too awed to approach the great Murayama Satoshi. I came to Tokyo to be the Meijin. Warn us when you change the subject... I have to beat Mr Habu to do that. One game with Mr Habu is worth twenty wins. Arazaki, beating you is just one victory. You're still young, there's no need to rush. I'm not like you people "You people"? Show Mr Tachibana some respect. You're an idiot. A real idiot. Shogi is a game of kill or be killed. That's the life for shogi players. You're so rude... I'm going to take a leak. I can't believe you could laugh about this. He's an interesting guy. —Welcome. —Mr Tachibana. —The game's over? —Yes. Murayama was spot-on. The game ended at the 117th hand. You asked Murayama about the outcome? You know what, Arazaki? Beating you only counts as one win... I heard you the first time! Murayama? Murayama? Man, he's such a pain. —Come on, get up! —I'm sorry. —The bill, please. —Certainly. "Osho Tournament: Habu versus Tamura" "Oi Tournament: Murayama versus Arazaki" Arazaki, rank five. Your time is up. From now on, it's one minute per move. He's really good. I've lost. —The fight started with the pawn to 6-E. —Thirty seconds. I was too late. Not at all. I nearly lost the game there. —But I didn't enclose it... —Forty seconds. Yes, I see. "Shogi Hall" I've lost. "Habu wins all seven titles!" "What an accomplishment." "Habu Yoshiharu wins the 45th Osho Tournament," "beating champion Tanigawa Koji in their fourth game." "Habu has achieved the unprecedented in winning all seven shogi titles." "I didn't expect to win four games in a row." "I was able to perform to the best of my abilities in all four games." "My desire to win seven titles distracted me at times." "I hope this victory will help me overcome the pressure to win." "This amazing accomplishment..." "has influenced shogi fans all over the country..." I've drawn up the document. Could you check it for me? Okay. This looks good. Thank you. "Murayama: A fruitful first year" "Habu: Unstoppable genius" Seriously? Habu married Hatada Rie! "Habu marries idol and achieved his eighth victory" They are calling it his eighth victory. Who cares? —Good morning. —I was such a big fan! King to 7-H, then silver to 8-I. Then retreat king, exchange 6-H with the silver and use it to mate. That's a mate if the king stays. Good morning. Good morning. Excuse me. Thank you. Have some. Thank you. —Richi (A ready hand). —Chi. Chun. I win! —How many points, Hajiri? —Two dora tiles and a self-drawn tile... —Three more bonus tiles. —Doubling. Winning all on your own. All right, Hashiguchi loses three points. Next game. Let's start. —Do I look weird in this? —Not at all. That's... quite a shirt. What matters is you like it. Yes. I'll go with this. Excuse me. We'll take it. Hey, we're here. Darn it! Not in my new car! Don't worry. I'll never get in your car again. Bloody hell. You got some on me. You forgot what this game is about. No wonder I couldn't figure it out. I see... You have progressive bladder cancer. We need to remove your bladder. One of your kidneys is not functioning. The other kidney is failing. How did you let this happen? Well, I was busy playing shogi and mahjong. It pains me to see you in denial. You know your condition better than anyone else. You know what will happen if you continue to ignore this. —Good evening. —What's up? Mr Tachibana versus Murayama? —Who's first? —Mr Tachibana. It's a tough game for Mr Tachibana. He's not his usual self. Losing the game would mean a demotion. His A-class status is on the line. It's probably the pressure getting in the way. I'm talking about Murayama. You need two to play shogi. Of course. But Murayama isn't looking at his opponent's chess pieces at all. What is he looking at? I've lost. A complete failure. Can we skip... the post mortem? My apologies. I didn't put up a good fight. No worries. "Murayama makes his way to the final tournament" This is no good. Satoshi is winning too much. "Murayama proceeds to the final tournament" "Murayama wins five games in a row" "Murayama can't come to the phone right now." "Please leave your name and message at the tone." "This is Harada from the Urology Department." "I tried calling many times. You've missed your pre-operation tests." "Please call us immediately." "Press 'seven' to delete this message." "Your message is deleted." Here's your order. —Pick up the order, please. —Got it. Corn and potatoes with butter? —Yes. —All right... Here you go... sorry to keep you waiting. Excuse me. You're back. Just for a little while. How are you? How's Tokyo? Are you getting used to it? Well... It's okay, I guess. I can't live outside of Osaka. Have you read anything new? What are you reading now? Oh yeah. I bought these during my trip to Arima. It's delicious. Would you like to try one? —I'll... —Yes? I'll come back another time. "Shogi Hall" Murayama? Why are you here? It's my turn. Why do you play shogi? Excuse me? Tell me. What about you, Egawa? I asked you first. I'll tell you if you tell me. Okay. I just happened to find shogi. They called me a prodigy back home and it's been twenty years since. So, it's your turn to answer. Not fair, you said you'd tell me. Murayama. Thank you... for practising with me today. Well... I'm very grateful. I managed to get to rank three. If I lose the next game I'll have to resign. And I'll die... Don't worry. Everyone dies someday. What concerns us right this moment... is our next move. Rank Three League, game fourteen starts now. Have a good game... Thank you. Fifty seconds. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine. Four, five, six, seven, eight, nine. Fifty seconds. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, —Nine... —I've lost. That's no good. Let's go. Sorry about all that whining. I feel much better now. Good to know. I've come to terms with it. I have no regrets. It was a great dream while it lasted. You're right. You have a long life ahead of you. I've dedicated my youth to shogi. This experience will help me move on. I learnt many things along the way I couldn't have known otherwise. You should take a break and... Satoshi, you drank too much. I envy you, Mr Mori. You can play shogi for fun and get paid while you're at it. —Watch your mouth... —Playing shogi is painful for me. Healthy people have no idea how I feel. That doesn't mean playing shogi ought to be painful for everyone. Shut up. You died on the chessboard today. I don't want to hear from a loser. No more. You've had too much to drink. —Why? —Stop talking. —What do you mean? —That's enough. What do you mean? How much was it? It's my treat. —Thank you. —How much was it? It's okay, I got it. No, I want to pay. I have the cash. Money means nothing to me. What are you doing? I have no need for it. So let me pay. How much was it? Stop it, Satoshi. Money may be important to the living. But it means nothing to a dying man. Stop that. Cut it out! I've put my life on the line for shogi too! Like hell you did! "A second life"? That's what losers say! What a depressing life! Satoshi? I'm running out of time. I want to win! I have to win! I must become the Meijin. Satoshi? Satoshi. Satoshi? Hey. Satoshi? Hey. Satoshi. You look like a kid. Satoshi, look this way. Come on. This way, please. Watch your steps. Today, Murayama, rank eight, will challenge Habu, the four-title holder. They are neck and neck with six wins and five losses. I hear the fans are very excited about this game. —Yes, they are finally facing off today. —Indeed. I believe Murayama has his mind set on beating Mr Habu. —He's very driven. —Right. How would you describe Murayama's style in one word? Murayama's shogi in one word? Wild. Passionate. It's hard to sum it up in one word. —How are things? —It's tough every day. Were you up late last night too? —Thanks. —Don't mention it. —How is it? —I couldn't stand the tension in there. You could cut it with a knife. Whose side will the Shogi God take? Rook to 7-E. What? What's going on? What a dangerous move. —I agree. —He might lose. No, I don't think so. I didn't see that coming! What an amazing move. Who would have seen that coming? Habu must be reeling from this unexpected move. Thirty seconds. Forty seconds. What a move! That's awesome gameplay from Murayama. This is amazing. Forty seconds. —Fifty seconds. —I've lost. Come on. Eat to your heart's content. Is it good? Hi. —Yes? —Well... Will you be turning in soon? Why do you ask? If it's okay, would you like to go for a drink or something? Just the two of us. Outside. Let's go. —Really? —Of course. Good evening. —Hello. —Welcome. —Thanks. —Beer, please. Certainly. —Please. —Thank you. I found this place yesterday. It's rustic and very nice. I bet you're tired of eating gourmet food. Not at all. Plus, the owner here doesn't bother you at all. —Welcome. —I bet he knows who you are. But he won't show it. I love this eatery. Good evening. —Are you Mr Habu? —Yes. May I have your autograph? Sure. Here. Thank you. "Playful Kiss"? It's a manga. You've not heard of it? No. You don't read manga? No, not at all. Do you play mahjong? No, I don't. Horse racing? Never. I like chess. Do you play? No, I don't. We have completely different hobbies. Here you go. More beer, please. —Another bottle? —Yes. —Mr Habu. —Yes? I have two dreams in life. One is to become the Meijin and then live a quiet life without shogi. My second dream... Yes? To fall in love and get married. I see. But I can't. Not with this body. My time is running out. But... At least once before I die I want to be with a woman. Here you go. But if it wasn't for this body, I wouldn't have known shogi. And I wouldn't have the chance to play with you. God works in mysterious ways. He always have me blindsided. Mr Habu. Yes? You and I... Why did we choose shogi? I don't know... But... when you beat me today, I was so devastated I felt like dying. Not wanting to lose. That's everything to us. Mr Habu. The ocean that you see is different from what everyone else sees. Sometimes I get scared. If I dive too deep, I fear I might not be able to surface. But... But with you, I feel like we might make it. I wonder what we'll see there. Let's go there someday. To the depths of the ocean. Yes. Do you see the shadow right here? This is a malignant tumour and in your case, it's at stage 3B where cancer cells have pervaded the bladder wall. The tumour is in a tricky position. The only option is to surgically remove the bladder and prostate. Satoshi? Did you know about this? —Why didn't you tell me? —It's my own problem. —Doctor. —Yes? How long will it take to recover from the surgery? That depends on how you define recovery... Just be straight with me. You'll need at least three months rest. You won't be able to compete for a year. That won't do. I finally caught up with Mr Habu. A year would put me behind. Listen to me. Even if the surgery goes well, you're a young man. Which means the chances of a recurrence within the next three years is 50%. Doctor, what will happen... if he opts not to have the surgery? He'll have three months to live. Satoshi, this is bad. It's checkmate. You understand what's at stake here. What about anaesthesia? Of course. You'll be given general anaesthesia. I'll agree to the surgery if we can do it without anaesthesia. Anaesthesia dulls the brain. I need to stay sharp for shogi, so no anaesthesia for me. You want us to remove your bladder and prostate with you fully conscious? I'll endure the pain. No way. That's impossible. I can do it. Enough... it's enough! My son has made it clear. He doesn't want to undergo the surgery. He's going to live life on his own terms. And then he's going to die and leave us behind. Tomiko. Yes. Okay. Sure. What's up? Yonenaga is mad at you again. He said you've been badmouthing him. Did I? I don't keep track of what I've said. You should trim your fingernails. I can't bring myself to do it. To trim my nails or my hair. They're growing, and that's proof they are alive. That has to mean something. Are you not feeling well? I've never been well. Forty seconds. Fifty seconds. One, two, three, four... six, seven, eight, nine, ten. Mr Murayama? Murayama Satoshi falls from A-class. Open the door. Somebody! Open the door! Open the door! Let me out of here! —Wait! You'll break the door! —Open the door! Somebody! Hurry up! Hurry! Hurry! Let me know if you need anything. Mum. I'll do the surgery. I'll never have kids. I'll never have my own family. Sorry. I'm sorry, Satoshi. I couldn't give you a healthy body. Satoshi, I'm going out. Do you need anything? No, I'm fine. Your urine bag? I'm good. "Shogi Yearbook Survey" "Hobbies: Music and reading" "Your motto: Losing is winning" "Ideal type of woman: Someone with a good personality" "If God could grant you one wish, what would it be?" —Right? —Yeah, it's good. —Better than anything I've had. —I told you. If you want a beef bowl, you can't go wrong with Yoshinoya. Miniyon for cream puffs, Mitchan for okonomiyaki, and Tokugawa for katsudon. I have a list. Make sure to order it with egg and miso soup the next time. Got it. Oh, yes. One more thing. I want a "misso" when I die. "Misson"? Is it tasty? It's not food. "Misso", as in a private funeral. You can hold a funeral in private? I don't know. But that's what I want. All right. I'll look into this "misson". Please do. And it's "misso", not "misson". Yeah, I get it. What are the two of you laughing about? It's men's talk. We can't tell you. Right, Dad? Oh, you guys... Hello. Hello. "Shogi Yearbook Survey" "If God could grant you one wish, what would it be?" "Get rid of God" You know what? It feels like we're back to when Satoshi was little. Hubby? Satoshi is still recovering from his surgery. But we've never gone on a family trip before. That can wait. He needs to rest and recuperate first. Yeah. Good night. Tomiko! I got my testicles removed. I don't even need porn anymore. I feel like a new man. His recovery is astonishing. I think he's in serious pain. The doctor is opposed to this. Excuse me. Four-title holder Habu's toss. Three pawns. Habu goes first. We'll break for dinner and resume at seven. It's going to get more intense with the exchange of the rook. Things are going to get interesting. A break in concentration can lead to an unexpected move. I agree. Excuse me. Excuse me? When will the game end? When one of them loses. This is too taxing on Mr Murayama. Then it's game over. Satoshi will lose. This bear-in-the-hole play is brilliant. Hey. Come here. Look. He's playing an excellent game. Murayama, rank eight, your time is up. From now on, it's one minute per move. If it wasn't for this body, I wouldn't have known shogi. And I wouldn't have the chance to play with you. God works in mysterious ways. He always have me blindsided. Thirty seconds. Mr Habu. You and I... Why did we choose shogi? I don't know... But... when you beat me today, I was so devastated I felt like dying. Not wanting to lose. That's everything to us. Thirty seconds. Mr Habu. The ocean that you see is different from what everyone else sees. Sometimes I get scared. If I dive too deep, I fear I might not be able to surface. But with you I feel like we might make it. I wonder what we'll see there. Let's go there someday. To the depths of the ocean. Yes. Fifty seconds. One, two... Fifty seconds. One, two, three... The battle raged on in the silence of the room. The nurse was on standby in the waiting room. Everyone's eyes were fixed on the screen. Fifty seconds. One, two, three, four... Fifty seconds. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven... Fifty seconds. One, two, three, four, five, six... Fifty seconds. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven... Fifty seconds. One, two, three, four, five, six... That's the deciding move. Yeah. Satoshi will win with pawn to 7-B. That's right. This is it. The game that began at 10.00am came to an end at 1.43am. Five, six, seven, eight.... Murayama made a devastating mistake that brought the match to a sudden end. Forty seconds. Fifty seconds. One, two, three, four... Thirty seconds. I've lost. Let's go. To the legendary treasure island. The ocean splits. I have to hide the cave. —Dad? —Yes? What's happening to me? —Mum? —Yes? Can I count on you? Yes. You're very straightforward. Yeah. Just what's happening? Pawn to 3-D. Silver to same position. Pawn to 3-C. Knight to same position. Not good enough. Oh, man... Excuse me, I just got a call from Mr Mori. What is it? Hello, Arazaki? Well... Satoshi passed away just now. Satoshi. You did great. His colleagues from Tokyo will be coming tomorrow. Habu came to see him earlier. Is that right? He said he had a game in Osaka and couldn't stay long. I see. It was five months after his last game with Habu. On 8th August 1998 Murayama Satoshi, rank eight, breathed his last. In the month following his battle with Habu Murayama fought and won five B-class ranking matches. He won back his A-class title. Each of those five games was a masterpiece. Each proof of his life on earth. They were also a testament to... Murayama Satoshi's passion for shogi. "...testament to Murayama Satoshi's passion for shogi." Egawa? Yes? Excuse me. Take Murayama's memorial issue to Sankyo Press. Sure. Murayama will be furious if you drop it. Yes. "Shogi Hall" "Murayama Satoshi passed away at age 29" "Total score: 356 wins and 201 losses including 12 defaults" "He achieved six wins and eight losses against Habu Yoshiharu" "Murayama was posthumously awarded shogi rank nine"
