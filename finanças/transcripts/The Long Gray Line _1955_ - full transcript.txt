Good to see you, Marty. What's this all about? Marty says his business is pretty urgent, Mr. President. Urgent, sir. It couldn't be more urgent. They've been counting their fingers, sir... and they find I'm over 7 0. They want to retire me after 50 years-- the ungrateful-- So I got Chuck-- I mean, General Dotson-- to fix it for me to see you, sir. Fifty years in the army is a long time, Marty. It is, sir, and then again it isn't, sir. It took me 30 or 40 years just to get the hang of it, you know. Now that everything is going smooth... it would be throwing away my training... a waste of the taxpayers' money, sir. Go ahead and smoke your pipe, Marty. I'd hardly know you without it. Thank you, sir. We Mahers take our own time about getting old. Over 7 0 I may be... and I wear glasses for fine print these days... and maybe I have put on a pound or two here or there... but I tell you, sir, I'm in better shape now... than I was that morning 50 years ago... when I rode the milk train up the Hudson... not knowing what I was getting myself into. I walked up that hill... a young lad, fresh off the boat. Halt! Who's there? Martin Maher from Ireland, your honor. Advance, Martin Maher, to be recognized. Recognized? How would you be recognizing me? I only set foot in this country last night. Corporal, another mick waiter. All right, come along, Paddy. Martin's the name. Ross Craig, Tipperary. What is this place? Is it maybe a prison? Or is it a loony house? This is the United States Military Academy. What a fine ruin it'd make. All right, pick up your feet, Paddy. Martin's the name. Do they have to wear iron braces to stand like that? That's the way cadets stand. That's part of the discipline. You could shoot off all their noses with one bullet. These men are being trained to be United States Army officers. They come here for discipline, and that's what they get. Where did they all go? You'll see them all at breakfast, Paddy. Pick up your feet. Martin's the name! How's the cow, mister? She walks. She talks. She's full of chalk. The lacteal fluid subtracted from the female of the bovine species... is highly prolific to the eighth degree, sir. That is the situation with the cow. - Where's my milk, mister? - Milk for Mr. Bullock, sir. - Get the wrinkles in that chin. - Coffee for Mr. Van Ennes, sir. - What's the definition of leather? - The definition of leather. The fresh skin of an animal cleaned and divested of all hair, fat... be immersed in a solution of tannic acid, chemical combination ensues. The gelatinous tissue is converted into a non-putrescible substance... impervious to and insoluble in water. This, sir, is leather. Come on, Paddy. Please. Let's get going. Please, now, go on. Come on! Come on, Paddy! Pick 'em up! Pick 'em up! That will come out of your pay! Vegetable plates are 1 1 cents each. Cups are seven cents. Saucers are four cents. Pie plates are nine cents. Soup tureens are 94 cents! Five o'clock for you too. Be back at five. Five o'clock. Back at five. There's nothing there for you. Do you know that you've been here two months... and you owe three months' pay for breakage? 'Tis a slave I am. 'Tis a slave I am. Working meself to a shadow and not a brass farthing to drown my sorrows. Come on back. Come on. I know I'm a fool to do this, but there's $3 of my own money. It's something you can jingle in your pockets... but not to get you in much trouble though. Thank you, your honor. 'Tis not every man has three dollars' worth of kindness in his heart. - Thank you kindly, sir. - You're welcome. Go on. Go on with you. Thank you kindly, sir. Rudy Heinz! 'Tis a fine soldier you look, all spit and polish. - When do you go on furlough? - Not before you pay me that five bucks. Five bucks? The five bucks I lent you to send to your dear old father in Ireland. Curious thing. I don't remember it at all. You were cold sober when you handed me that story! Let's have it! Rudy, I-- I've got terrible news for ya. You must wait a few months till I can balance me assets with me liabilities. You'll work out every chip of that if it takes the rest of your life! - Me? - Yes! I'm going to attend to Corporal Heinz over there. He'll do some time in the guardhouse for this. Time? Time-- Is that all you'll do to him, lock him in the guardhouse for a bit? He's in the army! That's all I can do! Come on. Get a broom. Get this up. Hurry up. Get it up right now. Hurry up. Go on. I will obey the orders of the president of the United States-- I will obey the orders of the president of the United States-- and the officers appointed over me-- and the orders of the officers appointed over me-- according to the rules and articles of war-- according to the rules and articles of war. - Your second enlistment? - No, sir, my third. This last year I've had a little tough luck. I've been tending bar-- - You? - Farm, sir. - You had previous military experience? - Yes, sir. I welcome you men into the United States Army. It's an army with a proud record of devotion to peace, victory in war. Here at West Point, you're at its very heart. You'll be in daily contact with the cadets of the corps. Your superiors expect you to conduct yourselves accordingly. Questions? Sir, I'd like to ask a question about breakage. If a man was to drop, say, a cannon-- Corporal Heinz! Right face. Forward. Column, right. Captain, darlin', we're going to be in trouble if the British should suddenly-- Corporal Heinz! All right, pick up your feet. - Good evening, Mr. Larson. - Are we back to mister again? By the end of the last hop, we were Nell and Whitey. This is another evening, but it's still young. Good evening, Mr. O'Carberry. - Where's Peggy? - Isn't she here yet? She left hours before the train. Her father let her take the new automobile. Eighty miles in one of those things and driving at night! She must be out of her mind! You two go on. I'll wait here. Go on. You'll miss the first dance. O'Carberry is it? There was a man by that name in Tipperary once sold my father a horse. My O'Carberrys have been away from Ireland a long time. Good thing too. Yeah, the ones that stayed are a bad lot. The horse was a stolen horse. Good evening. Stolen from the police barracks, all praise to him. Good night, gentlemen - Good night, Whitey. - Good night, Nell. Good night then. I'll write. - You been here all this time? - I'm still waiting for Peggy. If she's half the girl you tell me she is, you've no cause to worry. - This is Marty Maher. Whitey Larson. - How do you do, sir? If you have any trouble with horses, drop around and see Marty. - He's in the infantry. - Naturally! He knows horses. You don't think they'd put him in the cavalry, do you? Well, come on,Jim. Five minutes to taps. - Good night, Marty. - Good night, sir. - Good night, Marty. - Good night. Peggy, darling, I was so worried about you. I was afraid you had an accident. I spent the evening in a blacksmith shop getting this thing fixed. Peggy, I love you! - That cadet's off-limits. - Cadet, sir? I see no cadet, sir. I don't think that you do either. I never thought I'd live to see the day. The time we'll have tonight. You can walk through that village in 20 minutes. There's nothing to do. Me friend Jim O'Carberry... walkin' punishment. Corporal Heinz, permission to speak. - Take it easy. - Shoot. I'm here to tell you to your face you're a dirty informer! All right, break it up! Break it up! That fellow with the right cross, he's good. He's good for ten days in the guardhouse. And him gettin' off scot-free. I'll beat him to a pulp when I get out of this, the dirty informer. And you trying to lie out of it... telling me you turned yourself in. I'm sorry. I did report myself. I don't believe it. At the hop, we're on our honor not to go off-limits. I went. I had to report it. You do something wrong and get away with it... and nobody the wiser... and then you have to go and tell them that you broke the rules? That's it, only it's breaking your word that's the honor offense. Even the commandant could see how it happened. Before I knew what I was doing, Peggy was in my arms... and I was engaged to be married. Engaged to be married. The beauty of it. It fills my heart with joy, locked in a dungeon though I may be. They're letting you out today. What's the good? They'll only think up some new persecution to torment me poor soul. You're to report to the Master of the Sword. Master of the Sword? Captain Koehler. He's a swell officer. Master of the Sword? All right, get in here. I'm Captain Koehler, Master of the Sword. You're a rotten soldier. No soldier at all. Slovenly, undisciplined... insubordinate, bad tempered... and full of cute tricks. While I'm Master of the Sword... there will be no guardhouse rats around my cadets. You like to use your fists, huh? - Yes, sir. - Let's see you use them. You mean I have permission to hit the captain? You have permission to try. Go ahead. I'm interested in boxing, not dancing. I need a man, Marty. Would you like to work for me? That I would, Captain, darlin'. All right, let's get a shower. Good morning, Marty. Where's Captain Koehler? Captain Koehler? - He's in the boxing room, ma'am. - Thank you. - Hello, dear. - She's a perfect jewel. Take over the boxing class. - Marty! - Sir! The boxing class. Ten-hut! At ease! Ten-hut! At ease! Quiet now. The purpose of your instruction in boxing is threefold. A cadet must learn to take punishment as well as to give it. We're training you to be officers... and preparing you for positions of authority. This being the case, we don't pull our punches. We'll now have a demonstration of the value of footwork. Mr. Lummox. Mr. Lomax, sir. Yes, well, Mr. Lomax, would you get up into the ring, please? Well, now, I will now give you the benefit of me experience. Watch the position of the hands... and note the footwork. Well, now, Mr. Lomax... you now have permission to try to hit me. Permission to speak, sir. Go ahead. Is that uniform regulation? It's me issue, sir. Of course, the tailor took a tuck here and there. I always say, sir, if a man's a soldier, he should look like a soldier. Sure. - Sir, that foreign girl? - The what? The greenhorn with Mrs. Koehler, the one with the petticoats and shawleen. It's Mary O'Donnell. She's our cook. Good too. Is she indeed? Sir, you know the devil himself finds work for idle hands to do-- You know I'm not a man to go hanging around saloons. - What? - No, sir. I'm sober, industrious. - Are you all right? - Yes, sir. Is there was something I could do around the house to help Mrs. Koehler? - I'll ask her. Thank you. - Not at all. At any time. - Carpentry. I'm handy with the drains. - Fine. Thank you, sir. This is very homey, Mary O'Donnell. You icing the cake and me cleaning the drains. Like I was saying, us kids never learned our ABC's. We learned our ZYX's. My father insisted we learn the alphabet backwards... like Z, Y, X, W, V, U, T, S, R, Q, P, O-- I'll wager you can't do that. My father was a man of very strong opinions... as many a bloody-nosed schoolmaster has learned to his sorrow. A cut of fresh-baked cake, a cup of black tea and a pretty girl to talk to. A girl with a pretty voice too... supposin' for all I know. You can turn on the water now. Did anyone ever tell you you're a pretty thing, Mary O'Donnell... with your red hair and your fine, big feet? There's no girls in the world like an Irish colleen. Tipperary? Donegal? When first I laid eyes on ya, I found myself thinking... there's a girl. Look. Look how fine it runs out. You don't have to worry anymore about anything slipping down the drain. I'll be only too happy to come back at any time and clean it out again. Turn off the water! Turn it off!. Ya blasted idiot! Who told you to-- Your nice uniform! I'm sorry, ma'am. My remarks were not meant for you. They were meant for that chowderheaded Mary O'Donnell. I thought you two were having such a nice visit talking about Ireland. Talking, did you say? Talking! To now I didn't think she could talk at all! She's shy. She's been telling me what a fine workman you are. Did she now? I wasn't sure she even noticed I was here. She told me there are half a dozen things need fixing. I was going to have a carpenter in, but she insists you can do it much better. Honest now? Cross my heart. In spite of the fact that your heart seems to be on the right side... I'll stop by in the morning, ma'am. Thank you. Well, now, this is a happy accident. I'd no idea I'd find you here. No idea at all. Do you come to watch the review every Saturday? I said, ''Do you come to watch the review every Saturday?'' That's my friend Jim O'Carberry. First captain he is. I'm like a father to him. ComeJune week he'll be graduated. They'll be married in the chapel, him and his Peggy. Jim and Whitey Larson have been after me to stay for the wedding, but... I'll not be here. I said, ''I'll not be here.'' Me enlistment's up next week, Mary O'Donnell, and I'll be leavin'. There's some things I'd like to talk over with ya. After the parade, we could get a boat and go for a row on the river. Captain Koehler would be glad to give me a pass... seeing as it's the last one I'll be asking for. What do you say? Would you look at that? Sandwiches, apples and bananas-- peacen of cake. - Sir! Have I permission to speak? - Go ahead. If you got down on your hands and knees, I wouldn't take a pass from ya. This is the last review you'll see. Aren't you going to stay for the finish? You are leaving next week, aren't you? Sir, the way certain matters stand now, I wouldn't think of leaving. I'm on my way right now to reenlist. October winds Lament around The castle of Dromore But peace is in Her lofty halls Though autumn leaves May droop and die A bud of spring Is that you with the terrible bronchitis, Mary O'Donnell? You'll sit still and listen to what I have to say. You're too empty-headed to see it, but I've had the afternoon to think it out. You're the victim of a devilish plot. Captain Koehler, that beady-eyed horse thief-- Him and his friends from Milwaukee have got it all cooked up. The end will be yourself in the arms of that knuckleheaded Corporal Heinz. I'll not have it. I'm giving you your last chance. I'll have just two words out of you, my girl. It'll be yes or no. What do you say to that? - I say yes-- - None of your beating around-- - What's that you say? - I said yes. You said yes? The first word ever I hear out of you, and it's yes. Why didn't you talk to me while I worked my hands to the bone just to be near ya? Why would you never even give me a hint before I reenlisted? - Captain Koehler told me not to. - Oh, he did, did he? He said you were that full of arguments, that we'd only fight if I talked to ya. And that'd be the end of that. Full of arguments. A sweeter man than me you'll never find. When did you ever hear me utter a cross word, ya addlepated flibbertigibbet? There you go! And before you've even as much as kissed me. Before I've-- There's something you've got to know. What with one thing and another I've not been able to lay by much money. We'll make out fine. That we will. We'll save our money till we can go back to Tipperary and buy McGinnerty's pub. Back to the old country? Where else? With me old father and me young brother Dinny. They'll be that proud of me fine, healthy wife. Things are cruel hard in Ireland now. Things are cruel hard for the poor everywhere. But not for them who owns a pub in a hard-drinking locality. I'm happy here. This is a fine, proud place. Just being here, just being the littlest part of it... my heart's lifted up. I'll tell you what. I'll help you save the money. You can bring your father and your brother out here. Here? Himself? The old man? Him that's lived free all his life? Bring him here to West Point among the regulations-- It hasn't done you any harm. Captain Koehler says you're a better man for it. He's bragging about it? You know the new married quarters over by the parade ground? He's arranged for us to have one of the houses. The truth? You mean, with the electric lights and the hot and cold and the-- How is it that he's fixing quarters for us before I even-- Why, that Koehler! Of all the underhanded, conniving-- He and his wife put you up to this, and there's the proof. Is it sorry you are already, Martin Maher? It's sorry I'll never be, Mary O'Donnell. Good evening to you, Mary O'Donnell, woman of the house. I've gone over the account with that thieving bank, and there's $300 missing. I've matters of importance to talk over with you, madam. Forty-three dollars and twenty-six cents is all they say we've got. Butter wouldn't melt in their mouths. It was all your idea putting the money in the bank. If we'd left it behind that loose brick-- I drew out the $300 myself. - Did you now? - I did. The money I was putting by for our passage to Ireland? I did. Did you buy some diamonds maybe or a grand piano? That money-- Dadyo. Sure 'tis out of my dreams to look upon the face of my beloved father again. Since the day I turned my back on the green hills of Ireland... and crossed the wide wild sea, I've prayed for this thing. And now to see you here in me own house. Blessed is the day that brings you here. Blessed is the good woman I married... with her scrimping and scrubbing and putting away the money-- Will you have the decency to stop eating while I'm offering you the welcome? Go ahead, boy. Go ahead. Dinny! 'Tis a grown man you are. Proud I am to have you for a brother with yourself that grand looking. Corporal stripes they are. He's just after being promoted. Corporal, huh? I was just thinking meself, maybe I ought to join up too, huh? - That with your permission, sir. - That you will not. Do you know what this means? Four years of my life in the ashcan for each one of these. It's off to New York in the morning for you, bucko, to learn a trade. A good bricklayer, a bad bricklayer-- Any bricklayer at all makes more than they pay my boss... and him a great leader of men... a grand officer like Major Koehler, USA. I had a talk with him today. You did, did you? And what did you have to talk about with that beady-eyed horse thief? You might as well face up to it. There's not a cadet in the corps that can't kick the stuffing out of you. That blackhearted major tipped them off to a few of my weak points. - He's taking you off the boxing. - What? He wants you to have more time for the football and baseball. - That's my pipe. - And a fine pipe it is too. He thinks you'd make a grand instructor for the swimming. Instructor for the swimming? Me that can't swim a kick. Swim? Why, that blackhearted-- Be quiet. Shut up. Do you have the Irish, woman of the house? I have. Then 'tis for you to say the words. And may God bless this house that shelters us... and may He bless this grand country that offers us hope. Swimming. You be careful, Major. Be careful, Major, darlin'. Now repeat your instructions. In swimming, there are four things to master: confidence, timing, relaxation and breathing. The breaststroke is the best-- Repeat your instructions! In swimming, there are four things to master: confidence, timing, relax-- Repeat your instructions! How can I swim in all this water, Major, darlin'? Repeat your instructions! In swimming, there are four things to master-- Now, then, in swimming, there are four things to master: confidence, timing, relaxation... and breathing. The breaststroke is best for swimming with a pack and rifle on your back. We execute the breaststroke by the numbers. - You tired, mister? - No, sir. All right, then, you're first. Come back here! Come up out of there! Just a minute, mister. What kind of swimming was that? - The Australian crawl. - Was it now? Are you an Australian? - It's the fastest stroke there is. - So I've been told. Shall I get you a pack and a rifle and see how fast you'll swim with them? You'll swim the breaststroke here. I was showing you I don't need swimming lessons, so I can be excused. Excused is it? You'll not be excused. We'll need you for the swimming team. With your permission, I'll talk to Major Koehler. You've not my permission. You'll not be wasting the major's time. - I'm tellin' ya. - Sorry, sir. Go easy. Sundstrom's had enough trouble. And asking for more, flaunting the authority I hold over him. He's way behind in his studies. Take it easy. He plays football. - How many of you are left? - Five. Half of you get in the water. Keep rubbing it, my boyo. Keep rubbing it. Corporal, I told you I'd talk to Major Koehler. I'll save you time and tell you what he'll say. Sports here are a part of your training. If you can make a team, you'll make it. You'll swim, Mr. Sundstrom. With those shoulders you've got, you'll be out for football in the fall. If I'm here next fall. So you've decided you don't like West Point, huh? Look, I've wanted to come here ever since I was that big. Joined the regular army to get in. Beat my brains out cramming for exams. I didn't figure on the classwork. I can't keep up, not even if I work 2 4 hours a day. But I won't wait to be busted out. I'll resign, go back to the ranks. Well, now, from the ranks, are ya? Look, now, there's such a thing as overtraining, you know? What you need, my boy, is a change from the books. My wife serves a stew and hot biscuits fit for the saints in heaven. A few ladles of Mary O'Donnell's stew will do your classwork a power of good. You'll be welcome for supper come Saturday night. And no beans. All right. Look. I think it's working. New fuzz. Like peaches. That's it. Keep rubbing it, morning, noon and night. In no time at all, you'll have hair like an elephant. Help! He can't swim! Well, now, in swimming there are three things-- I don't understand it, Mr. Sundstrom. It isn't like Martin to be late. - Where the devil is Martin? - I don't know. Perhaps I could run down to the saloon-- You will not. Keep away from me stew! - If ya ask me-- - I am not asking ya. Half the onions are missing. The gravy's so thick a mouse could trot on it. Oh, me buns. They'll be destroyed. Take them out then. I'll not be kept waiting in me own house. Come to the table, Mister-- God bless you. - What's your name? - Sundstrom, sir. Oh, well, come on. Do you smell Mary O'Donnell's Donegal stew? - Look who I brought you. - Kitty, me love! Just happened to meet her on my way home. She kept me waiting with her primping and powdering. Miss Katherine Carter. We call her Kitty. May I have the honor to present Mr. Sundstrom. What's your front name, Red? James on the roster, but it's been Red ever since I can remember. Well, good evening, Red. Come on, the two of ya. Sit down there. Come on, dear. - All right, sir. - There you are. - Sit right down. - Thank you. Come on! Do we eat, or don't we eat? You're coming out to help me. Come on out to the kitchen. I made the mistake of telling her once I was a waiter. Never dropped a dish. Me idiot son. Oh, dear. It's working. Go on. Down with ya. You wouldn't believe it, but Kitty's a college graduate. She's teaching the youngsters at the post school. She's that bright. When I was a lad, a girl that cluttered up her head with education... was sure to turn out flat-chested and with a squint. Well! What was that thing you were going to stay in your room and study tonight? Orthographic projection. Whatever it is. What will you bet Kitty's got it all at her fingertips? The worst thing about higher math is getting over the panic. It's not so hard once you get confidence and relax. How about cylindrical coordinates or conic sections or parametric equations? They're not too difficult. Sure, it's like swimming, for instance. It's a matter of confidence, timing... relaxation and breathing. - Indeed now. - If I can help you, Red-- Thanks, but I don't see how you could. You and Kitty can both work here in the house. Did you know I can spell Massachusetts? You can start tomorrow. It's Sunday, and you've the day to yourself. - I'm free tomorrow, if you are, Red. - Well-- Of course he's free. Get your books and meet her in the morning. I'm not a case you're going to cure in one treatment. I'm down in all of my subjects. Once we start, it'll-- And once we start, we'll have to keep right on. I'm not afraid. You're sure you don't mind? Of course she doesn't mind. She's only too happy to do it. - Isn't that right? - Right. That's settled. It'll be a grave disappointment to me, me girl... if this young fellow isn't up in his marks and playing football next fall. Save me a piece of the cake. Me young friend's about due. Where do you go off to every evening? I go walking with this young friend of mine. A nice young fellow he is. Happy for a word of advice from me long experience. - Who is it? - I don't know. - Would you excuse us, please, a minute? - Certainly. It's a woman! Great Gogarty. It's the superintendent. Thanks be to Gogarty. It's not a woman. I'll never forget that rainy day in 1 9 1 3... when for the first time we played the little school from the far west. - Good day to you, General. - Good day. Sit right here. Thank you, sir. Looks like a bad day for the Irish. - Are you a betting man, General? - I might make a little wager with you. - A dollar. - A dollar. Notre Dame. It's the name of a French church, not a football team. - Did you get a bet down? - I finally managed. - Twenty-five dollars. Even money. - Even money? What did you do, find a lunatic? My father. Sorry. Army, time out. Play ball. - Touchdown. - Does that hurt? It's Chuck. Get in there, mister. - You all right? - Put him down there. Doctor. Get in there, Buck. That left hand is weak. There goes my chance for all-American this year. In the second half, the sun come out, and with it went my fortune. - Time! - Dorais for O'Rourke. - Rockne for Glennon. - Play ball. Something happened never before seen in football. Did you see that, sir? It's illegal. It's a foul. It's baseball. It's legal, all right. Is there something wrong? A forward pass? Red, get in there and break it up. Touchdown! The fightin' Irish. Robbers! Thieves! Football? You dirty scoundrely bunch of north of Ireland-- - Good evening, Father. - Good evening, my son. Let this be a lesson to you, my boy. Betting against Holy Mother, the church. At ease, men. Well, gentlemen, we came up against a new kind of football today. I'll say only this... that I'd rather have you learn a lesson than win a ball game. When you become officers and you're in combat... the only thing that you can expect is the unexpected. Learn to deal with it. If this game today taught you that lesson... then I don't care what the final score was. That's all, boys. Get your showers. Half the sportswriters in New York were in those stands today. I don't want to read tomorrow's papers. How is it with your studies? Don't worry. I can squeak through the rest of the season. And after this season? After Mr. Walter Camp has maybe picked you for an all-American? Then what? Major Koehler said to me the other day-- ''Marty,'' he says-- ''That Chuck Dotson's more than a good athlete. He's a good man. He'll make a fine officer.'' - Did I hurt you? - What you did, or what you said? Either. That Colonel What's-his-name-- the one that teaches military engineering-- He tells me you'll not get by your midyears. I hear you're as far down in your other work. You seem to talk a lot about me. What a man's got on his mind, he can't keep out of his mouth. Did you come to West Point to be a football player or an officer? It'd be fine if you could manage both, but it's plain you can't. You've worked me over enough Marty. I've made a bit of money betting on Army with you running touchdowns. It'll not be the same without you. Without me? Major Koehler will think none the worse of ya. All you'll have to do is say to him, ''Major, I've been thinking it over. If I keep on with the football, I'll be busted out. So I've decided to quit the team... and get on with what's more important.'' You'd better get dressed. It's getting late. - Chuck, how's that ankle? - It'll hold up fine, sir. Considering he won't be straining it from now on. Major, why do they have to be so hard with the studies? This is West Point. Yes, sir. That's what Chuck was sayin'. That's why he's quitting the team. - Sir, I-- - I know, Chuck. Go on. Get your shower. We'll have a cup of coffee. Come have a look! How are you? - It's not all yours? - Indeed, it is. I was out seeing what it would do on the road and landed up here. - It's gorgeous. - Have a run around with us. Himself's waiting for his tea. - Is there enough for me? - We always have plenty. There's no telling when Martin will bring home a platoon of cadets. Dadyo! Look who's here and wait till you see his new motorcar. I'll get the tea. I was out for a spin in me new car, so I thought I'd come by-- - I saw it! - It's a fine car-- power of 3 5 horses. True. It cost me a great deal of money. - Your head cold? - No, sir. Stuck it under the bed. Is it your habit to go around looking like a rum seller? A rum-- I'm a businessman now. My firm is doing general contracting-- Contracting what? Get out of me way. - The tea's ready. - And about time. He's doing wonderful, Dinny is. That's true. My firm is expanding-- Who gave you permission to sit down? I'm sorry, sir. But it is true. There's a place there for Marty too. It's the chance of a lifetime. - Sit down. - Yes, sir. I've been too long in the army. What have I got to show for the years? There's things a man wants his wife to have. There's things I want my wife to have. Even this furniture is government issue. Did you ever hear me complain, Martin? We know that, but, look, Mary. Marty here can make three to four times his sergeant's pay the first year. If we stay here, there's nothing to look forward to. Year after year-- There's no end to the money a man can make. Will you step into the other room, girl? So you've nothing to look forward to, huh? I'll tell you what you've got to look forward to. Sometime next spring your wife is going to bear you a child. A child? A child. And why is it for you to tell me? Has she no tongue in her head? God bless you. A child! Are you sure? In the spring, do you say? - Will it be a boy or girl? - How the devil would I know? - Get on with ya. Come on. - Yes, sir. Ever since I first set eyes on West Point-- ever since I first saw the young men of the corps-- Sure you told me I was a silly woman for talking about it, but... if our son should be born here... where you've worked so hard-- After the time we've waited, after what the doctor told you... it's enough for me that we're having a child at all. I'm praying it will be a boy. Who's to say one of these days... his name might be in the yearbook too? I'll pray with you. You're a wonderful woman, Mary O'Donnell. Go on with ya. Stop it, Red. You're not the expectant father. Will you sit down? Mr. Sundstrom, will you take charge of Marty, please? - Sit on his head, if you have to. - Me, the father of it all. Come on. Confidence, timing, relaxation and breathing. Nothing to it. This is no time for being funny. - You all right? - Fine. I'm the grandfather of a boy born about two minutes ago... 6 pounds, 1 1 ounces-- Trust you to be the first to find out. They make me stay here while you-- A boy! - I'll just be-- - I gave her a sedative. She had a hard time, but she's all right and the baby's fine. You'll see them in the morning. A boy. You're the father of a son. It's a great day. Sure I'm on me way to becoming an ancestor. It's been a strain on me. Red and I have to meet some people. Bye-bye, Papa. Good night. Well, then... we'll be needing our rest... after the great thing we've done this day. Have you thought of a name for the boy? You've all the saints to choose from. Well, I had it in mind we'd name him after you. With your permission, sir. You have my permission, son. Martin Maher, the Third. You'd better get yourself a little rest. I think I'll sit up a while, Da. I think I'll go upstairs and say me beads. God bless you, my boy. Good night, Da. Come fill your glasses, fellows And stand up in a row To singing sentimentally We're going for to go In the army there's sobriety Promotions, very slow So we'll sing our reminiscences Of Marty Maher, oh The father of a proud cadet Is Marty Maher, oh We all got together and picked out a present for Martin Maher,Junior. The Third. Correction, Martin Maher, the Third, the class of-- - '36. - The class of 1 936. Since he's detained elsewhere this evening... we hope you'll accept this cadet saber for him. May he wear it with pride and with credit... to his parents and to the corps. Well-- Well, now-- - Congratulations. - That's great. Congratulations, Martin Maher, the First! Wouldn't you have felt silly if it had been a girl? I gave 'em me solemn promise it'd be a boy. You'll find boodle in the kitchen, and there's ice cream in the box. Of men we can offer a charming variety Far renowned for learning and piety Still I'll advance you without impropriety Father O'Flynn is the flower of them all Here's a health to you Father O'Flynn Slainte and slainte and slainte again Proudest of creatures and tenderest teacher And kindliest creature in old Donegal - Now a jig. - Come on! The police. It's the doctor. I was just saying to myself a minute ago... what would the celebration be without the doctor? - You'll come in and join us, sir? - No, not right now. Can I see you a minute? Let's go, fellows. Come, I venture to give you me word Never the likes of his logic was heard Down from thayology into mythology Mother of God. The poor little tiny thing. But you said he was all right. How could he die so quick? A baby,just a few hours old-- I've got to get over to the hospital. We're not going to tell her tonight. She'll sleep through till morning. I'm sorry, Marty. Hey, you're off-limits! Come on. Let's get out of this. Let's go. Leave me be. Let me alone. You're off-limits, all of you. And we're gonna stay off-limits until you come back with us. Come on. I'll take the flowers and put them in water for you. - Ten minutes. - Thank you, sir. Forgive me, Martin. Forgive you? For what? The doctor says... that I can never have another. Try to find it in your heart to accept the will of God. Would you be moving my bed up to the window? So that I can look out. It was a cruel, hard thing. But we're so much better off than most. We have so many fine boys here... and it's almost as if-- Or would they only be putting in mind... of the son we had for such little while? Is that the way it is with you, Martin Maher? So that you wish you could go away from here... and never have to look at them again? This is no time to talk about it. Me just starting a new enlistment. What I wish or what I don't wish. That was the spring the Lusitania was sunk... and all of a sudden a lot of people wanted to know... how good the training was at West Point... what kind of officers we were turning out. They came and took a sharp look at the class of 1 9 1 5. Charles Edward Dotson. Chuck Dotson. Never did make all-American... but he was well up in his class for graduation. Timothy Aloysius Shannon. Mike Shannon. A fine river he was named after. Vicente P. Lim. Vicente P. Lim. First cadet from the Philippine Islands. Omar Nelson Bradley. - Congratulations. - Thank you. George Edward Stratemeyer. Congratulations. James Alward VanFleet. Congratulations. Joseph Taggart McNearny. Congratulations. Dwight David Eisenhower. Congratulations. 1 9 1 5. Ah, that was the class the stars fell on. The long gray line marched on. The class of 1 9 1 7 didn't wait forJune week. The country was at war, and they were needed in a hurry. Two days! That's no honeymoon at all. We'll have our honeymoon when the war is over. Excuse me Mrs. Sundstrom. Excuse me, ma'am. May I have my first salute from you? Second Lieutenant Overton. Sir. - Bye, Marty. - Bye. Bye. Let's get rolling, Red. Cherub wants to be the first second lieutenant into Berlin. I'll be back by Wednesday, dear. May I have a salute too? So long. Good luck. Come on, Red. Bye-bye. Will you stop your blabbering at all the boys? Will you shut your mouth? All aboard! Next stop, Berlin. Bye! Bye-bye. There you are. I found you at last. I've been all over the post. Whatever happened to my application for transfer, Colonel, sir? I've been meaning to talk to you about this. Instead of my disapproving it, why don't you just tear it up? Does the colonel think I'm not soldier enough for the fighting? You're needed here. One of us has got to stay. Lieutenant, my orders, please. Yes, sir. That does it, sir. Thank you. Orders. I am to set up the training program in all the new camps. I can't even wait for my replacement. You mean there's to be a new Master of the Sword? That's right. And he'll need you to keep things running for him... while you break him in. Your place is here. I know I can trust you with our cadets. It was on my conscience, sir... watching the young ones go off... and me, a soldier trained. Nobody'll ever question the courage of the Mahers. Come here. - Age: 42. - And a bit more. Height: six feet four and a half. - That's correct. - Weight: 200 pounds. That's true. Da. Come along, Da. Colonel Koehler wants you to stay here and help me. Well, Tommy, you know where to find me when you want me. Sorry, Mr. Maher. God bless you, young gentlemen. God bless you, every one. Hi. It's a shooting war. Babies. I saw it. Such a nice little fellow. Too small to make the football squad... so he carried the water bucket. Rudy Heinz too. Sergeant Major Heinz. - Kitty, darling! - Mary, dear. Will you look who's here! Oh, you look fine! Do you have any news from Red? - It's good to be home. - Take Kitty's bag up to the spare room. Would you put a cushion behind Kitty's back? - I'm just fine. - Go on now. Tell me about New York. Did you have a nice place to stay? Would you set the table for tea, please? An apartment. I want you to come and see it one of these days. - There's a terrible draft on Kitty. - I like fresh air. The shawleen. Put it around her knees and make her comfortable. - Really, I'm very fine. - I'd like to ask just one question. - What do you hear from Red? - Will you put the water on for tea? I only have two hands, woman. What would you like me to do first? Get rid of that stinking pipe. You ought to know better. - I love the smell of his pipe. - About Red. Tell me. What do you hear from him? I had a letter a week ago. He and Cherub Overton spent a weekend in Paris. Can you imagine Cherub in Paris? That baby. Tell me, did you walk all the way from the station? - Should you be doing that now? - Of course! Walking is good for me, quoth the doctors. Doctors! New York. Is that a place to be raising a baby? I'm not looking that far ahead. Who knows where Red will be ordered when the war is over? He was in Honolulu while he was an enlisted man... and he's hoping we'll be sent there. Just think of it. The sun and all those palm trees. Now, tell me, where's himself, Old Martin? Oh, he's working overtime, he is! - Working? - Yes. A new batch of horses came in. With Major Gillis away, it's up to him to see that nobody cheats the academy. Don't forget to get the cookies out of the icebox. I bet Old Martin was never happier. You know himself does the work of two young men. You'd think if he stopped for a minute the kaiser would have us surrounded. Well, I'm glad I'm not the kaiser about now. I've had that Blackjack Pershing after me... and it's a very uncomfortable feeling. Don't forget the cakes and the cookies, and put on the tea. Tea, cakes, cookies. And me boys over there, fighting. What are you doing with me convenience? Mary, the armistice has been signed! The war's over! Thanks be to God. Take it away. You can burn the whole house. Get it on with you. Oh!Just a minute. What the devil you doing down there? Take it away. Oh, Mother of God. The finest young men in the world. We bring them here... train them, teach them. Duty, honor, country. Then send them out to be killed. I'll have no more to do with it. Kitty and the baby. We must go to them. Can you get a pass, Martin? I've got furlough time coming up. After that, my enlistment will be over. We'll go see Kitty, and we won't come back. That's enough of your wild talk. I never talked saner in my life, sir. Dinny'll have a job for me. I'll call him to come up and get us in the morning. We'll find a little place in the city for the three of us. I'll not go with you. I slept me first night in America on this post... and I'll sleep me last night here. And if they've got a bit of ground in the cemetery... I'll rest happy sleeping at West Point forever. I ask for your blessing, Dadyo. You'll always have that, my boy. Subsist. Ah, sure, he's grown so big. God bless you. He's got a grip on him too. Why, he's the spitting image-- Payment in full for Red's life. This came special delivery from Senator Hale. Everyone's been so kind. It was in all the papers. I got letters from people I don't even know. Flowers, even. Do you know what this is? It's an appointment to the academy... for ''the son of Captain James N. Sundstrom... effective at such time as he may be ready... to follow in his father's glorious footsteps.'' He must be a kind and understanding man that-- What right has he to decide my son's life for him? They took his father. That's enough. They didn't take his father. Red worked hard to get to the Point, and harder to stay there. He became what he always wanted to be, a professional soldier. And professional soldiers are trained to die. Is that it? No, they're trained to do a job. Some die young and some don't... but they all give their lives for their country. They're ready when they're needed. They set the example-- and their wives. Yes, their wives must set the example too. I wanted little Martin to go to the Point. There was no time, Mary. Not even in letters. If I only would have known what Red would want-- Ah, sure, you don't have to make up your mind now, love. Not today or tomorrow or even next year. No. Look. I'll tell you what. Mary and me will stay over the night in New York... and tomorrow morning you come back to the Point with us. You pay us a nice, long visit. You and the little fella, huh? You'll have to call Dinny. Of course. He'll drive us up. And I'll have to ring up that blackhearted-- Major Whitney, filling in as Master of the Sword... and see what inducement he'll offer me to reenlist. With the oath I will now administer... you will become members of the United States Corps of Cadets. Raise your right hand. Repeat after me. I-- - Say your name. -James N. Sundstrom,Junior. Do solemnly swear that I will support the Constitution of the United States... and bear true allegiance to the national government. That I will maintain and defend the sovereignty of the United States. And that I will at all times-- obey the legal orders of my superior officers-- and the rules and articles governing the armies of the United States. Say, ''I do.'' Ah, Red, me boyo. Mr. Dumbjohn. Halt. - Sloppy posture. - How is the cow, Mr. Dumbjohn? Sir, she walks, she talks, she's full of chalk. The lacteal fluid extracted from the female-- Let's have the definition of''leather,'' Mister. If the fresh skin of an animal, cleaned and divested of all hair, fat... and other extraneous material be immersed-- Mr. Dumbjohn, forward, march. Gentlemen. You're wasting your time with that plebe. I taught him all the tricks meself. Just like I taught you, Mr. O'Carberry, and your father before you... and his father before him. And you too, Mr. Shannon... and your father and his grandpappy-- God rest his soul. - So long. - Bye-bye. See you later. Four proud and happy years, those were... watching young Red grow from a plebe... into a first class man to make your heart beat high. Why did you have to go and sit down again? Take your pants off, love, and I'll press them for you again. Trousers, and I haven't got time. I'm in charge of the hop committee. Will you please hold still! Good night, Mom. Good night, Mary. Good night, Marty. Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death... I will fear no evil... for Thou art with me. Thy rod and Thy staff, they comfort me. I have been asked to make an announcement. At dawn today... Japanese aircraft attacked Pearl Harbor. While there's been no official word... it is assumed the United States... is now at war with Japan. Our fathers'God To Thee Author Of liberty To thee We sing Long may our land Be bright With freedom's Holy light Protect us By Thy might Great God Our king Amen I've gotta talk to you. Get on with it, boyo. It can't be as bad as all that. On my Thanksgiving leave... Carol and I were married. I must have been crazy. The whole thing was crazy. Listen, we were only married four days. Then her parents had it annulled. I'm not married now. You broke your oath. But an annulment. The law says the marriage never existed. It makes no difference. You've the honor code to face up to. How could you take your fine career and throw it in the gutter? You, of all the cadets that ever lived. Maybe because it was all handed to me. I didn't come to West Point like the rest of them. They dream about it when they're kids... and they work and sweat out the appointment. Like your own father did. If they haven't got what it takes, they're washed out. The ones that get through know what the Point means. I guess I didn't. Until now, huh? This is my last year. With the war, they're sure to speed up graduation. Once we're in combat--- It's between you and your conscience. You'll have to decide what's the best to do. Better be getting back. You'll be late for your formation. Yes, love. You're coming right over? Martin and I'll be waiting for you. Fine. Bye. What is it? What's the matter? It's Kitty. She's coming right over. She sounds like she's worried, maybe. You've not been telling her about Red? I have not, indeed. But you've had me half distracted this whole week... with the worry that you'd go blathering it out yourself. It's over and done with, Martin Maher. The marriage has been annulled... and there's no need for anybody to be knowing anything about it! Do you hear me? It's over and done with. I know about it... and my heart's like a lump of lead. I can't even look the other cadets in the eye. I'll not stay here... and see him walk up and take his commission. Him that's dishonored himself. I'll not do it, do you hear? I'll not have it on my conscience. I'll put in for retirement... and I'll tell Red why. That boy has been like me own son. Everything that I wanted my son to be. And if you do him any harm, if you harm one hair on his head, I'll-- I'll never forgive you. - Hello. - Mother of God. It took me quite a while to decide. Then I had a long talk with Mother and a short talk with the commandant... and a few words with the recruiting sergeant. I'm very proud of him. - You're proud of him. - I'm a prize recruit. A letter goes with me that says I don't need basic training. I'm ready to ship out. Yes, well, this calls for a celebration. A cup of tea or-- If I miss my train, I'll be AWOL. Wait. I'll put on me clothes. I'll go to the station. There's no time. But subsist, man! Good-bye, Mary. Wait a minute. The recruiting sergeant gave me a tip. He said the main thing in the army is not to start off in trouble. Yes. It was on the tip of me tongue... to give him the same advice myself-- I remember-- Good-bye. - Good afternoon. - VI Ps. VI Ps, is it? Sir, the brigade is formed. Thank you, gentlemen. The review is about to begin. But first I'd like you to see this plaque to Colonel Koehler. - The first Master of the Sword. - A what? Master of the Sword. Established a fine tradition here. And there is Sergeant Marty Maher... who has done a great deal to carry it on. - Hello. - Good afternoon, sir. Now, gentlemen, I think the review is about to begin. You work here, Pops? - Aye, I do, sir. - Did it ever occur to you... as an American citizen with a vote... that a place can be so overgrown with tradition... that it loses touch with reality? - How was that again, sir? - I'm talking about tradition. Why those same silly uniforms have been worn for over a hundred years. It's time for more realism here and less tradition. Why, man, we're at war! Our boys are dying in battle. Pardon me, sir, but how old are you? Why, 42. I'm the youngest governor in the United States. - You don't say so, sir. - I do. Youngest-- Who do you think is leading our men in battle? I mean leading them? Standing out there under fire, saying, ''Follow me.'' Where else would the West Pointers be, when there's dying to be done? And who's making the plans, directing the war? Eisenhower, let us say. Douglas MacArthur,Joe Stilwell... Omar Bradley and Georgie Patton. Do you think generals like that just happen? They do not. They're made. They're made, Mr. Alderman or Tax Collector. - They're made right here at West Point. - What's your name? Martin Maher, sir. And you'll find the name in the book. There's no use glaring at me like that, Colonel, darling. You'd have said the same thing yourself. Mary O'Donnell. What are you doing out of bed? What are you doing all dressed? I'm going to the parade. Are you out of your head altogether? That walk and the climb back up the hill after. - The doctors-- - Doctors! I want to go. It'd be half over before we got there. You'd not enjoy it. The place is crawling with governors and aldermen... and dogcatchers and-- All right. Tell me now. What is it that you've been up to? Well-- Nothing that I'm ashamed of. That youngest governor, what's-his-name. Sneering at the academy, he was. And nobody but me to tell him what he's too blind in his eyes to see. So I told him. I remind you what himself used to say, Old Martin. There's a time and a place for assault and battery. Well, I'll not take back a word. Let him go and report me to the superintendent. And he will too. As fast as his hands and knees will carry him. There. That's right. Take off the hat, now. What is it, Mary, darling? Help me out to the porch. But shouldn't you go back to bed? Help me, Martin Maher. Come along now. Let me put this here. Now sit down. Lean back, comfortable like. I'll go get your medicine and the shawleen. I'll be right back. Hey, merry Christmas! - Well, come in. Pirelli, Kennedy. - Hope you don't mind our barging in. That's quite all right. I wasn't expecting visitors. It's a business call. We're the press. A special football number of''The Pointer.'' A review of last season, prospects for next year. Fine. You'll have to pardon the poor house. It isn't as spick-and-span-- - What's burning? - The eggs! - Oh, my gosh. - Wait, boys. I can do that very well. - Sit down. We'll handle the K.P. - I don't need any help. You're gonna pick us an all-time army football team. - Right. - You mean from the beginning till now? - That'll start a Donnybrook. - The front-page box. ''Marty Maher's All-time Team.'' Well, it's a fine way to make 1 1 friends and 1 0,000 enemies. Keep out of that, Mr. Pirelli. I can do that very well. I grew up doing this in my old man's delicatessen. - Where's the bread? - Right over here. Thank you. If he were only here to argue with, Colonel Koehler would-- Who's he? Colonel Koehler! - Merry Christmas! - In the kitchen. And wipe your feet. For quarterback, now. Charley Daly's my man. - D-A-L-Y. - Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas, Mr. Dotson. Merry Christmas, Mr. Stern. - What is all this? - Present for you from Dad in Belgium. For me? It's a Dotson family custom to give presents Christmas Eve. Well, now. This wouldn't be one of those booby traps, would it? Let's see. Look at that. - Boy, it's a beauty. - Sure is. Think of him taking time to send me a present from Belgium... and him with a division to command. Well, now, where was I with me selections? Charley Daly. Me all-time quarterback. Forty years, and never a man touched him since. How about my old man? That's just what I mean. I'm treed like a toad. Your father, Chuck Dotson, would have made all-American but for me. But then, who'd be commanding that division? Halfbacks, now. Paul Bunker, and I'll have no arguments... and Elmer Olliphant. Take it down. O-L-L again-I-P-H-A-N-T. Come in, whoever you are. And wipe your-- Hey, Pete. And Red Cagle. We can't leave him out. - You got visitors. - Big brass. Big brass, you say? Who could that be? The superintendent? Who could it be? Georgie Patton? Casey Widemyer, perhaps. Merry Christmas. We've come home. What can I say, and the tears in my throat? You look fine, buckalo. - Take your coat, Sergeant? - Mrs. Sundstrom? Thank you. There's my bag. Thank you, son. Tell me-- Are you home for long, boy? It's just a convalescent leave. As soon as my leg's fixed up I ship out again. The Pacific, maybe. Professional soldier. I've been saving these. I wanted you to pin them on me. Captain's bars? Attention! Battlefield commission. - Well, I-- - Sit down in your favorite chair. - No, I don't-- - Oh, sit down. Red'll sit down too. - Lean back. You comfy now? - Fine, thank you. Pillow! - Come on. Hurry. Oops! - I don't want the pillow. Martin Maher, when was the last time you ate? - Well, I had a little-- - You. - Pirelli, ma'am. - Hit that chow line. You, K.P. - Holy Moses. - On the double, quick. Everyone. Oops. Come on. - No, Kitty, I don't want the shawl. - Yes, you will do it. - Come on in with the tree now. - Merry Christmas. Put it right there. - Wait a minute. I don't want a tree! - I wanted it. I haven't had one in a long time. The ornaments are underneath the cellar stairs... in a box called Bushmill's Irish Whiskey. - Bring it up, will you? - Coming through. Get that food now, 'cause he needs it real badly. Oops, be careful of the coffee. Come on! Will you bring those ornaments, please! Hurry up. - Marty, now put the bars down. - Here are the ornaments. - Let's go. - Here we are. Jingle bells,jingle bells Jingle all the way Oh, what fun it is to ride In a one-horse open sleigh - Jingle bells,jingle bells - Wait a minute! Come, fill your glasses, fellows And stand up in a row To singing sentimentally We're going for to go In the army there's sobriety Promotions, very slow We'll sing a merry Christmas To Marty Maher, oh Oh, Marty Maher, oh We'll sing a merry Christmas To Marty Maher, oh So, you see, sir... it's been my whole life. Everything that I treasure in my heart... living or dead... is at West Point. I wouldn't know where else to go. I have West Point on the phone for you, sir. You talk to them, Chuck. Find out what the snafu is up there. - Yes, sir. - I-- I've taken up a great deal of your time, sir. I hope I'll always have time for old friends. - Thank you, sir. - Come and see me again. Okay, Buck. Fast as we can. See you. Here. I almost forgot. Tell him to rub this in well, morning, noon and night. - Did you have permission to leave? - No, sir. - Even sign out? - Well, I was that excited-- What are you, a recruit? You're AWOL! I'll have to fly you back to save that fool neck. Let's go. It's that blackhearted Master of the Sword. - Director of Physical Education. - Airfield. Wait a minute-- You should know enough by this time not to absent yourself without leave. - Sir, I don't understand-- - Come with me. Listen, sir. The tune they're playing. - It's the tune-- - This is for you, Marty. The cadets asked for it. You're at attention. For me, sir. It's been a great day for Marty. It's been a great life for Marty. If only Old Martin and Mary were here. They are here... and the others.
