Come on, Marcus. Come on. Come on. I mean, it's really good, but you... you gotta fingerpick those. Strumming ain't gonna cut it anymore. Look. Check it out. Gotcha. Can I... Can I hit that? If we don't hit a new demo on this first pass, then we're toast. Mmm-mmm-mmm. Stop it with that. It's not new. Oh, "You don't have to be an athlete to sweat." That's the campaign. "You don't have to be an athlete to sweat, Sports Aid." Done. My God, that's... You're a genius. I gotta go to Steven's show.

You got a D, son. Hey, Mom. Hey. How'd they like it? This next one... This next one, I did not write. Aww! But I think you'll dig it anyway. I met the gal who did write it on top of a water tower in a rainstorm in Poughkeepsie. I was 19, and I was off my face on a bottle of the hard stuff, stumbling through this field when it started to come down, kind of rain you could choke a frog with. So I ducked under this water tower for cover, when all of a sudden, I hear this girl screaming down at me. I look up, and she's all the way at the top, and I can't tell if she's in trouble, enjoying herself, or just a downright loon. So I figured I'd better investigate. Whoo! I thought I was gonna die climbing up that thing. When I got to the top... I see Miss Drunken Angel sitting across from me. I think, "Maybe I'm already dead." And that, my friends, was the night I met my wife. Do not let the get-up fool you. She is deep, deep, deep, deep undercover these days. At heart, she's still the same sexy loon she was when we were 19. Yeah! Come on, Maggie.

It's none of our business. Steven! I know. Just... ...didn't have to fucking sleep with him, all right? I know what you like. Hey, Jake! Jake, take it easy, huh? This is none of your concern, Steve. I know. It's none of my business. Just come over here. Talk to me for a second. I'm okay, Steven. I know you are, hon. I'm okay. I just wanna talk to Jake. Come on, man. Take a walk with me. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. Dad! Shit. God... Can we get some help over here? Fuck! It's okay, hon. Come on. It's okay. Just walk away. He's all right. Come on. Let's get you out of here. Come on. I'm sorry. Hey! Dad! Dad! Dad! Somebody do something! Somebody help, please! Please! Please! Marcus. What are you doing there? Mm, I was hungry. Uh... how can you eat? Sorry. I'm sorry. You're hungry. Of course you're hungry. I could make you, um, eggs. No. Could make you a grilled cheese with... There's no bread. Cereal? But with what? Vodka. I could make you an excellent plate of saltines and peanut butter. Fine. Thanks, Phillip. No, I just need some time to get some stuff organized. And Marcus is having a rough time, so I should be here for him. Give Blake those accounts for the week. Tell him it was so sweet of him to check in and that he'll do great. Also send me the keynote on Sports Aid when it's up. Keep me in the loop, Phillip. Thank you. Jane called, Mom! She and Seamus are coming to take us to the store. What? Why? You said we'd go shopping, and they offered. Fine. I can't believe your house isn't full of food. When my mom died, my kitchen was like an encyclopedia of casseroles. Oh, but you didn't have a reception. No. All these people we barely know have been calling our house and shit, people I don't even remember, like from the church I went to when I was a kid. It's none of their business. Exactly. Even like Jake's fucking brother, Ted, the guy who works at Quickie Lube, yeah, he calls the house to tell me "how good of a man your father was," and how he "ain't gonna make any excuses for his brother, but..." That's fucked, man. And I'm like, "Leave me alone, dude. My dad hated you, and your brother ruined my life." Yeah, my dad hates that dude too. I'm sorry, man. I didn't mean to... Oh, no, no. It's cool, man. They're trying to finish three campaigns by the end of the week. That Doritos thing is a mess. But we did get Russ Leatherman to do the V.O., which was pretty cool. I don't know who that is. Oh, you know. You just don't know that you know. That looks incredible. The rucola and the basilico are from the giardino. Do you know who Russ Leatherman is? No. Should I? Hello, and welcome to Margaret's phone. If Margaret is the name of the person you wish to speak to, speak now. The Moviephone guy? We went for drinks after he did the voice-over and made him record our outgoing messages. Cool, Mom. Pretty cool. Yeah. It's meant to be ironic, Marcus. Pasta's really good. Marcus made it after the game. Damn. I'm sorry. How was it? It was pretty good. I got a goal. And two assists. Sporting thighs and pesto. College is gonna love you. By then, it'll be the guitar that gets 'em. Girls do love a guitar. Dad says it always works for him. Well? It works. I gotta say it still works. Marcus. Marcus. Hey! I know you and your dad were playing guitar, and I know he... he would want you to keep it up, so... Now? Yes, now! Come on! Um, okay. Uh... Play the guitar, Marcus! Uh, okay. This is, uh, a C. There's a G. Don't you know any actual songs? Um... Never mind. Just do what you were doing. I wanted to hear a song. Yeah! Ooh! Aah! Shit! Are you okay? He's okay. Here. Here you go. Ha ha! Shit happens when you tussle with the trash can, tiger. Oh, hey, Marcus. I didn't see you there, man. How you holding up, son? You know, you got a lot of people praying for you. Know that. Barbara and I, we just feel awful about it, you know? You know, Jake's my baby brother and all, but ever since he came back from the war, he just goes off on a damn dime. Hey! Hey, motherfucker! Those are my new Dickies! Hey! Ooh. Yeah, okay. Yeah, it is. It is. You should come in. Hey. Hey. You're not going in? Nah. Oh, come on. Don't be a fraidy-cat. Seriously, Tracy, no. Okay. Sorry. I-It's fine. I'm just not really feeling it right now. I get that. Whoo! Damn, Marcus! Shut up, Tony. The view? Really? Okay. I guess so. Your mama's so fat... I don't even know. I... I got nothing. I got nothing. Oh! Shit. Wow! Oh, my God. Shit. Hey. Well, what are the chances? I guess they're pretty good. Why didn't anyone invite me? I was at home. May I use this chair? Thank you. I tried to make the chicken pockets that your mom made me buy, but... whole house smelled like grease, so I said pancakes. You know. Hi. Hi. Oh! It's okay. It's okay. Oh, I'm so sorry. Don't worry about it. I'm so sorry. Come on, Mom. What can I use to stop it? Okay. We should go. I'm terribly sorry. We should go. Okay. I feel awful. It's okay. We'll get some pancakes at home. We don't have pancakes at home. Excuse me. Get a little bit of pancakes with syrup. We're gonna go now, okay? I left my coat. I'll grab it later. I'm not going outside with a fucking coat on. Sorry. Hey, Margaret, I-it's Grace. Uh, Phil asked me to check in to see again if you wanted to approve the presentation reel on Sports Aid before it goes out to the client, so, um, he just wanted to make sure that you were in the loop. That's foul. It's better for my stomach. Are you watching this? No. Hello, Mrs. Lang. This is Charles from L.I.C. Leasing. I wanted to touch base regarding the payment schedule on your 2016 BMW. If you could just give me a call back on my direct line, I would greatly appreciate it. Hi, Margaret. It's Jackie. I'm just wondering if we're still on for that yoga retreat next weekend. Look, I know... Howdy, stranger. How you doing in there? You know. We're going to get food. You wanna come? Uh, no, thanks. Um, I've got some things I gotta do, cleaning and stuff like that. Okay. Wait here for a second. Here. Mom?! Hey, Mom! Hey, Mom, could you come up here and help me with something? Yes. Ooh. Yes, Marcus. Everything here is on auto-pay? Um... I think so, yes. Um, what about the account that you put your paychecks in? Uh... Ooh. I c-can't do that. The mortgage is not paid, Margaret, so I want you to sit in this chair and help me, okay? Is there a file that says "checking" on it? I think I could find it if it said "checking" on it. Don't do that. Okay, fine. I'm sorry. Please just come sit in this chair, and help me, okay? Look, I'll get your vodka. Just don't move. I'll sand the floors and get toilet paper. And the fucking tree stump. I almost hit it again today. And the fucking tree stump. I'll take care of it. You'll see. I'll stick my chest out and handle it. You picking up? Uh, yeah. Right, yeah. Of course. Get you the keys to the truck. Thanks. Hey, I just, uh, you know... Fuckin' people, man.

Oh, my God. Fuck. Marcus! Can you tell me what this is? I'm sorry. I had to pee after the game. I forgot to take my cleats off. What did I tell you about this floor? I don't know. You don't know, or you don't remember? What do you want me to do, Mom, cut my fucking feet off? All right, enough. Enough. Don't get smart. It's not my fault! I'm not the bad guy!

We get that a lot. Take your time. You know, so she claims she kicked me out 'cause I didn't clean the roof. Heh. I know it wasn't 'cause of that. So, you know, one night, when I was high, um, I got this grand idea I should go clean the roof right now, you know? So, uh, that's what I do. And, uh, I could hear her yelling at me, but, uh, I wasn't done, so I didn't say anything. I just kept scrubbing that fucking moss off the roof. So, yeah, it must have looked a little weird when she came round and saw me up there, especially since it was the middle of the night. Man, I don't know, man. I mean, I... Like, my skin itches, and I'm... I'm scared as hell, but I think... I think that this is better. So I got four days today. That's right. Four days, man. Hi. I'm Nancy. I'm an alcoholic. Hi, Nancy. Hi, Nancy. I'm really grateful to be here today. I'm grateful for my sobriety. And I want to say welcome to anybody new that we have. So I put my phone number on the first page, okay? Use it anytime, day or night. Mine's in there too. Thank you. I know this must be super hard with your situation. Excuse me? Oh, you probably don't know. I'm Tony and, uh, Paul's mom, Nancy, Nancy Biddle. The boys were really worried about you at the Waffle Stop. Hmm. But listen. We all have our stories, or we wouldn't be here. I tried to steal a horse once. You did what? I did. Sorry about that. We're running a bit behind. But then, we're always running a bit behind. So when you testify, gotta be very straightforward, what you saw, who was there, what they did. You made a statement to the police. I think so. You did, but for the sake of clarity, we're gonna need to walk through it one more time. You ready? No. Sorry? I'm sorry. Okay. I'm ready. You are? Hi. Shh. Marcus, sweetie? Your mom is here. What do you want? Hey. Um, there's a preliminary trial next week, so I-I thought that maybe, you know, you'd want... I don't want to. No, I'm sure you don't want to. If I saw that guy again, I'd bash his fucking skull in. Marcus... What? I'm just gonna leave this here. Just in case. Look, they're gonna open up his war record. They're gonna talk about PTSD. Bunch of bull. Hey, no argument here. Look at Butch Rose. He was out there same as Jake. Same battalion. Exactly! A-And now he's running his dad's dealership, and he's doing great. Are we doing this thing? I'm just stating... Let's do it. So right in the middle of this guy's shit-talking, Seamus whips his dick out, and I'm like, "What the fuck, man?" Right? But then he starts pissing on the dude right in the back of his leg, and of course he starts swinging on Seamus, and I figure I better do something, so I grab this two-by-four, and I hit him right in the skull. It made this crazy sound, like a... like a hollow pop, like the dude's head was empty or something. That's crazy. Yeah, that's a crazy story, Marcus. Anyone want anything?

I am actually gonna go home, yeah. Want some company? Really? Really. It's really good. You think so? Yeah, I do. You did that with a chain saw? And a chisel. Where does someone learn to do something like that? I took Sculpture in college. Who didn't? Thanks. So you're staying with Seamus? For a couple weeks now. Shit got pretty hectic at home. Ah. Thought you might be hiding out from the cops. Why? You know. For beating down that Quickie Lube guy. Nah. Cops around here are weak, man. Couldn't do shit if they tried. You know that guy Jake, the guy who killed my dad? Well, they're not gonna do shit to him. That blows. That's why I'm gonna do it myself. What the fuck? Dude, you can't smoke in the house! Seriously, what are you thinking? Can you leave? Don't. Yeah. I think I'm gonna leave now. Bye. Man, can we talk? Sure. Look, I know you're going through a tough time, but... It's all good, man. I'm just gonna go stay somewhere else. I don't want you to stay somewhere else. I want you to stop acting like a... a douche. What? I put the cigarette out. Yeah. Okay. I want you to stay somewhere else. Hey, Kevin, I just wanted to say that I agree with you. This thing could go south pretty quickly tomorrow. They paint him as a war hero, you know, one who got ruined by the war, a jury of his peers might let him walk. It could happen. It could happen. We just all gotta be prepared for the fact that it could happen. Dad! Hey, Dad! Hi. I've been really fucked up, you know. I know. I wanted to apologize... and say that you didn't do anything wrong. I know. I need you to know that whatever happens, you didn't do anything wrong. Wh-What do you mean, "Whatever happens"? Nothing. I'm sorry. Um... I'm really fine, but I've... I've gotta go. You're going to the trial? Mmm-hmm. You want company? No. Marcus, you came. I'm gonna go up there. You know what? I thought maybe that you'd want to sit over here by... I love you, Mom. I love you too. Hey, Jake! Jake, take it easy, huh? This is none of your concern, Steve. I know. It's none of my business. Just come over here. Talk to me for a second. I'm okay, Steven. I know you are, hon. I'm okay. I just wanna talk to Jake. Come on, man. Take a walk with me. All rise. Be seated. Before we continue, Mr. Walters, you wanted to address the court? Yes, Your Honor. Go ahead. I want to plead guilty, Your Honor. You understand, Mr. Walters, that this plea precludes your right to a trial? Yes, sir. And that you're pleading guilty to murder in the second degree? Yes, sir. Mr. Young, you've spoken with your client? Yes, Your Honor. Guilty plea is accepted. Okay. Something more? Yes, Your Honor. If possible, my client would like to make a statement. Go ahead, Mr. Walters. I know that I can't change what happened... but if I could take back one second of my shit life... it would be that one. I just... I got nothing.

I think you feel better being mad at your mom than just plain old sad about your dad, and I get it. Mad, you can do something with. You can punish somebody with it, but I want you to listen and listen good, kid. You have one life. You had one dad, and he's gone. You have one mom, and she is not, and she's trying, and while you're busy wallowing over here because nobody knows the kind of pain that you're in, I have a friend who just lost her husband who might be able to understand.
