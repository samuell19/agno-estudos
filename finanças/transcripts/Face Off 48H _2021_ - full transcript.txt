Hey, is there something engraved here? Why didn't you sold it to get the money for mom? Son, we had lived together for a long time but we had no child. When we found the White Aquilaria Crassna, we prayed on it and then we got you. That's why I engraved your name, and your date of birth on it, and used it as a present to give to your mom.
