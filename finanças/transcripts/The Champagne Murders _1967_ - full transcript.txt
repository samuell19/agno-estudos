Strictly for a credit card. That's it. Uh, hold on, let me just slide in there. Listen, I don't even know you! Come on, that's it. Boo. My name is Paul, what's yours? Michelle. Michou. Nobody asked me my name. You come here often? No, it's too crowded. My name's Christopher. Would you like me to leave, maybe? Wonderful, wonderful, wonderful. Well you're wrong. I'm a charming person. All my friends'll tell ya that. Paul, remember that bit about the last shall be first, and the first shall be last. Last shall be first, first shall be last. No hard feelings. No hard feelings, forget it. Mmm. I think... Get these... Just be a good girl. Don't be like that. You crazy or something, come on! Take it easy, would you? Did you get her legs? Don't be a hog, give me some, will ya? We've done everything we could for you, Mr. Wagner. You mean I'm cured, Doctor? Don't overdo it at first. See your friends. Try not to worry. You tell me your family's champagne firm runs itself. That's fine, you can devote yourself to having a good time. This is a prescription I promise to take. By the way, if the depression recurs, particularly if you suffer any more blackouts, you can always come back to us. All right. Good bye. That was a Pyrrhic victory. A what? So much for your education. How did you find out about the American buyers? Oh, I don't know, I heard Christine tell Jacqueline. Er, no, Christine told me so herself. That's when it costs the winner more than the loser. I thought she never talks business with you? Oh, she does when I listen. Generally I don't wanna know. Denise, the bags. Oh. Yes, but she sent you out to play while she had her little talk, hm? True. Ah. She knew you'd tell me. And that means she wants me to know. Well you had to know sooner or later. Are you coming to Hamburg with me? Have you asked her? I haven't had the chance, she's locked in her office all day. She doesn't sleep there? No, but she's working on it. Thank you. And I thought I'd done you such a favor. Meaning? Greater love hath no man than this, to provide his friend with a rich wife. Some favor. Look out! Ooh, you remembered! The out-buildings, the chateau, the wine stores at the vineyards, and the material, the cellars. And of course these offices where we are right now. And the trademark. Yes. Mr. Locoum is particularly anxious about the brand name. Wagner Champagne. Trademark, doesn't make any difference what you call it. It concerns the very intestines of this whole deal. A business as eminent as this one naturally commands a big price. That goes without saying. One might say it is more than a business, it's part of the national heritage. But it's so lovely outside, it seems such a shame to keep you in here. Shall we go out and I'll show you around? Oh, we'd be delighted. We shall be back later, Jacqueline. The rest can wait till then. This way. Well, here we are. The famous Wagner vineyards. 700 acres of land. These people have worked here all their lives. As you see we stick to the traditional methods. The cellars are 12 miles long. We have about 25 million bottles down here. Most of them are ready for shipment. As you know, it takes between three to six years to turn out a quality champagne. And of course, we sell our product all over the world. The estate dates back to the 17th century. Did you know that? I know a guy, a very nice guy. Sweetheart, they don't make 'em any nicer. He bought up a great newspaper. Everything went fine for him and this newspaper, except for one little thing. He forgot to buy out the name. Now he's standing on the street corners. He's a bum. When I see him, I slip him a dime. Very good friend of mine, do you know what I mean? Well now I'm sure Madame Belling, let's put it this way. You own the whole works, you see, but Mr. Paul Wagner still has the name. You're gonna have to talk him out of it. I don't say this isn't a good setup as it stands. I love the old things. But, who can afford to be sentimental? You can't, I can't. I'm not asking you to be sentimental Mr. Locoum. I don't have to. I shall simply persuade him. But um, I just need a little time. How much time? Well, let's say six months? You said six months a year ago. A year ago Mr. Wagner was still in hospital. His accident left him... A little strange. Strange, you mean he's crazy? Well, I think probably Madame Belling means he's emotionally disturbed. I don't get it. He's been somewhat given to fantasies. Oh but don't worry about that. One just needs to tackle him at the right moment, that's all. You mean he's still crazy? Mr. Locoum is trying to say... She knows what I mean. He's very, very cooperative. You'll get on very well together, I'm sure. I'm sure. Sure, sure. Paul, can you hear me? Paul, I wanna talk to you. Come on, Paul, I know you're there. Don't play around. Leave him alone. Why should people have to answer bells? I was only trying to remind him to come to dinner this evening. Don't worry, he's coming. Ah, the car. Little car. Hm? Mr. and Mrs. Chaussoe-Larent. It's your turn Miss Pelletier. Countess Dubreuil. Mr. Pelv..., Mr. Pelvous. No, he's too much of a bore, cross him out. - What? - Cross him out. - What? - Dressmaker. - Dressmaker. - And you made that lovely dress - you're wearing at the moment? - Yes. - Very pretty. Very, very smart... - Oh, really! Of tomorrow or the day after. Now, you've chosen general knowledge. General knowledge, and this means that our questions will be in a general category. Now what I need is a general. Comprises all kinds of questions, scientific, technical, and questions on general culture. - Are you ready? - Yes. Well, Miss Pelletier, and now for our first question, which is a question on painting. - Do you like art? - Oh yes. These kidneys are half cold. I can't eat them like this. Take them away and reheat them. Did Gauguin go to live at the Kloanec Inn and gather around him one of the most famous schools in modern painting? Hold it, Louis. Gee, mine are very good, dear. She answered right off the bat. How 'bout you, Paul? Oh, very good, excellent. They're really fantastic. I love them. All right, all right, all right. Bring them back. And what about General Poitier? Why yes, of course. Put him down. Boy, it's gonna be some party. Everybody with one foot in the grave. Why don't you ask some young people, for Pete's sake? Why not ask Denise? Paul, how 'bout Denise, she's fun. Oh, yes, yes. Is she a friend of yours? Yes. Would you like her to come? Oh, yes, why not? Denise. Denise? Denise Vaillant. And Evelyn. She's amusing, you know her. Well all right. Evelyn Wharton. Geometry, Miss Pelletier, how do we find the surface area of a triangle? By multiplying the base by the height, and then dividing by two. Top of the class! Bravo, bravo, bravo. I'm sure all our viewers... Oh, and we mustn't forget the Delacourts, and the Bremont d'Orvilles. Who discovered the laws of universal gravitation? You must know that, Jacqueline. I haven't forgotten them, sir! I mean about the laws of gravity. Think of an apple. A nice red apple which suddenly falls! Newton, sir. Yeah, Newton. Time's up. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Leave Jacqueline alone. How can I do anything with this racket going on? Yes, of course you did, but you've got stage fright. You have to answer in time. Let's change the subject. We'll change to something a little easier. - Miss Pelletier, what is a sampan? - A sampan. - A sampan. - Oh, everybody knows that. It's the name for any small boat in the China Seas. Too easy! - Five seconds... - Perhaps Miss Pelletier doesn't share your passion for boats, Chris? - Mm-hmm. - Time's up. So, you do listen. You always say you don't. How could you know her name was Miss Pelletier if you didn't listen? - Sneaky. - Well, I can't help listening! It's like a circus in here. One comes to dinner in the hope of finding a little peace and quiet. And all I hear is this infernal machine going on all the time! Jacqueline, turn it off, will you? Turn it off, Jacqueline. Can you tell me the name, or rather... There's never anything on on Tuesday. Tuesday's the worst. Oh this made me laugh. "Mrs. Harve Coignard, Mr. Jean Coignard and Mrs. Grissette, "et cetera, et cetera, et cetera, "are grieved to announce the death of Mr. Harve Coignard..." What sort of an evening is this? I'm invited to dinner and all I get is a business consultation and TV quiz. Don't you wanna talk to me anymore? - Or isn't there time for that? - See you again together with our viewers next week. Let's all say once again bravo, for her difficult and brilliant victory, to Miss Pelletier. And I'm sick of her, too! A film by Luis Bu√±uel, La Mort en ce Jardin. Oh, shut up! I broke it. Well, I think that'll be all for tonight. We'll continue it in the morning. Of course, good night. Good night. - Paul? - Hm? I've got something rather urgent to say to you. Come this way into the drawing room, will you? Lucky it's Tuesday. I wish you'd believe me when I say that I'd give anything if you and I could only... Could get together. It seems so foolish not to work together when we both share the same interests. I thought you didn't like mechanical mice? Why do you persist in playing dog in the manger? Uh, translate that, please. You know perfectly well what I mean. All right, I admit your name does carry some weight. And you're dying for it to be yours. You never give up, do you Christine? Well at least I fight to some purpose. You just fight to make things more difficult for yourself. Look for instance. How much do you earn as representative of the Champagne Makers Association? Oh, not a tremendous amount. But enough to feel free to travel around. The day after tomorrow I'm off to Hamburg, for instance. You're going to Hamburg the day after tomorrow? Day after tomorrow. Okay, okay. Wouldn't it be better to work together? I told you 20 times already, no! And your stupid pride won't let you change your mind, will it? Right! Paul. - What? - Your place is here. Even though I do hold a majority of the shares. Thanks to your father's little swindles, right? Well at least he left you your name. Well, he could hardly do anything else. I mean the champagne is still called by your name. Yes. Isn't it maddening? - Paul. - Yes. I've got a proposition to make you. I thought you would. Well, go on. Three million. Would that interest you? Old francs? Certainly not. New ones? I'll have to think it over. All right. I'm quite prepared to bargain with you. You're right. Your name is worth it. And I'm willing to pay you very dearly for it. Yes. Upstarts yearn for nobility. - Are you referring to me? - No, no, no, no. To the two buyers you've been hiding from me for a week. Huh? I'm sure they must've offered you a good price for the Wagner name. Hm. Wagner is associated with stature and tradition. But with the Belling Trademark. Even though the champagne is the same, what does the bottle matter as long as the contents make you drunk? But then your Americans don't think like that, do they? It's me they want , not you. If I accepted, I would want five million, Christine, darling. Then you accept? Oh, no, oh, no, no, I told you I would think about it. Very well. That's all right. There's plenty of time. Coming to my little party? Will your two buyers be there? Of course, it's for them I'm giving it. And if the business is settled, Chris will get his yacht. Ah! Chris' yacht. Chris? Chris. Chris. Chris! Chris... Chris. Chris! Darling, I think I've pulled it off. Oh that's wonderful, I'm so happy for you, dear. What's that? Oh, it's just the maid, she's running my bath. Get rid of her, darling. Uh, leave by the other door will you please, Catherine, I'm not dressed. I'm sorry, darling, I don't really feel too well. I'm tired. It's always like this when I haven't had enough television. Down here will be just fine. Come on, I might enjoy it. What a waste. I got plenty more. You're an extraordinary young woman. Yes. And very, very expensive. Oh, who cares about the money? Me. Oh, Mr. Locoum, I didn't see you arrive. How delightful to see you. And Mr. Clarke, how are you? I see you've met Miss Wharton already. We're old friends. Mr. Locoum and Mr. Clarke have both been made Knights of the Champagne Makers Association. - An historic event. - A very great honor. Come and talk to me about big business. Do let me take that from you. Yes, thank you so much, oh. - Oh. - Madame. Sorry. Uh, may I offer you a drink? Yes, I'd be delighted. Let's go to the bar. I'm fascinated by big business. Naphthalene balls. Naughty. That could be managed. Of course, my real interest is alcohol and chocolate. Uh, darling go and get me something to drink, will you? Some of that delicious champagne over there. Do you know who that is? - Mm-hmm. - Our prospective buyer. We really went through it, then. Yes, yes, but it was a clean war. Whereas last time... When the hostess is happy, the party will swing. Of course I'm happy. - Aren't you? - Yeah. What can I do to make you happy? Anything you like. Anything? Anything. Oh. What would Chris say? You know perfectly well that what is Chris' is also yours. Isn't that the true meaning of friendship? Madame, the Bishop has arrived. Duty before pleasure. Yes, yes, yes, it was a real war. We were men in those days, we took a beating, oh yes, yes. You have to be a real man to stand that and fight. Well there are wars and wars, but that one, you knew you were fighting. Never needed before. Where is she? In the arms of the church. May she find peace. - I was wondering if you were going to talk to me. - So was I. You know, I know all about you. You had that rather nasty accident. Oh, it doesn't seem to have impaired anything. Oh, well I'd like to see that proved. I have a little studio in Paris. I give parties, but they're much naughtier than this. I'll let you know. You don't waste time, do you? It's in such short supply. Who's that little brunette over there? Oh, she's just a secretary. Well she needs encouragement. I know just how she feels. Lesson number one, don't look so sad. You have everything. Just think, "I'm beautiful", hmm? Hmm? May I get you a drink? No, I'll get you one. And now we never know where to go. The whole Riviera has become impossible. Circulate, don't just stick around in a corner! I want you to be sweet to the Bishop. He loves Americans. I don't wanna be sweet to the Bishop. Now, who wants something very badly? How do I know you won't change your mind? You're hurting me. You promise? Yes. - Will you promise it? - Yes, I promise. Well cross your heart and spit. Oh, I cross my heart. Spit, then. Hi, Bishop! Yes? Huh? Oh, yes. After giving the matter much thought, I find that I don't like champagne. How's it going? - Oh, I'm so sorry, I just... - Oh, Mr. Clarke. Oh, well you can meet Mr. Wagner. Yes, the elusive Mr. Wagner. I'm very happy to meet you. Not elusive, Mr. Clarke, not elusive. It's just that we move in different circles. Yes, you might say that we are different, eh? But soon to interlock, I hope. It's a wonderful party. Just, just a lovely place to give it in. That grand chateau. Don't you think so, Mr. Wagner? I was born here. Oh yes, that's right. That's absolutely right, you know. I'm glad you came. This party has all the joy of a public hanging, doesn't it? I'm sorry you're not having a good time. Are you? Good evening, General. Drop dead, General. I'm on duty, Mr. Belling. Well if you're on duty, come on and amuse me. Smile, console me. See the people, see them laugh, see them drink, see them fall on the floor. Where would you like to be? Oh, well, where would I like to be? Scaling the seven hills of Rome, maybe, or, eating sea food in Salt Lake City. Huh? Or water skiing in the shadow of the pyramids. Anywhere but here. Well, I haven't had much chance to travel. Oh, I see. Well, uh, maybe we could take a little trip right now. Come on with me. But what if my boss needs me? Come on with me, I said. I wanna tell you something. What this party needs is a climax. Oh, well you're the one to give it that, eh? You've got me cornered. Very well, I'll provide the surprise. Wait just a moment. Oh, great, great, great. Great fella, huh? - Yes, isn't he? - Yeah. Oh! Don't do that, please. You know, you're not so bad, Jacqueline. Please. No, please. Please. Shh, shh, shh. Oh, stop it Christopher. Mr. Belling to you. Jackie! Jackie, would you believe it! I'm sorry, madame, you must be mistaken. Isn't he marvelous? And what about Cannes? And Genoa? And Corfu? And what about Athens? In '61, on my yacht? Ungrateful boy. Uh, madame, my name is Christopher. It's true then, that I love Greece. Its only drawback is that it casts a spell. It keeps you from seeing straight. I can see that watch straight enough. A platinum Audemars Piguet. A little gift to stand the test of time. He was a poet. I never could resist a poet. Would you like something to eat? Yes, I would. A plate full of those bony little Greek fishes. What did you call them? - Mees Mitt Nut? - Why is everyone avoiding me? Madame, I'm afraid the season's finished. I suppose I'm not rich enough for you. Ah, such a convivial atmosphere. Do you agree just between us, the prospects for this year's crops are wonderful? A vintage as good as '52, wouldn't you say? - Yes, yes. If an amateur's prayers... Why not? Promote wishes into facts... Ladies and gentlemen, will you please come in. I have a surprise for you. - Come in, come in. - Come in. - Follow me, everybody. - Come on. Come on, come on, closer, closer. You come over here. Chris? Your Grace, General, next to the Church. That's salable, in America that's a very good sign. Yes, you're right, you're right. Watch this. Yes! That's Belling Champagne! Taste the Belling Champagne. Will you stop it! I'm sorry. That is not champagne. And it stinks. Oh, Mr. Locoum I'm sorry! Whoopee, whoopee! Hey, hey, Paul, what are you crazy? Tell your wife to keep her five million, and I'll keep my name! Yeah. What? Nobody wants any? Come on. Is it a bad year or something? People like that should be locked away! Oh, shut up. Oh, hey, hey! You! Very funny. Funny. Look what you've done. Did I do that? Yes, you did that. Am I still invited to one of your parties? Hey, you're getting me all wet. Boy, that was a lousy thing to do. Why lousy? It gave the party a lift. I couldn't care less about the party. But what chance have I got now of going to Hamburg with you, with Christine upstairs working up her nervous breakdown of the month? And what makes you think that? Your chances may be better than ever. Oh, sure, she'll just be in the mood now for handing out little presents. It was for you that I did it. Just think, if I'm gonna carry on like that, she'll need someone to keep an eye on me. Someone to act as a good, steady influence. And what makes you think that someone could be me? Persuade her, talk her into it. Convince her that you've got her interests at heart. Well I do. Right? As long as they're the same as mine. You're worrying too much about this, dear. Remember, these are businessmen. When they want something badly enough they don't give it up simply because they've been splashed by a few drops of liquid. Why should it matter, anyway? They make the stuff. - You mean to say it was Viva Cola in that bottle? - Yeah. How do you know? Well I just guessed, it's the same color anyway. Oh, no. It's not going to work, I can feel it. Of course it will. You wait and see. Oh, I forgot to tell you. There's a marvelous bargain in Hamburg right now. A 28 meter yacht with its crew, and every conceivable piece of equipment. I thought it might be smart just to go there and have a look at it before it gets snapped up by somebody. A fine time to talk about that after what happened tonight. You should get away from all this for a while. You're gonna crack up if you keep on driving yourself the way you do. We both need to get away on a long trip. Remember that marvelous time when we just went drifting around the Greek islands? You used to eat platefuls of those little silver fish. What were they called again? Merithes. Hm. You know perfectly well it's impossible for me to get away now. Why not? Even without the American deal we could still drop all this and have a marvelous life together. Why spend the best years of your life chained to your desk at the mercy of people like those two monsters, hmm? Hamburg? Did you say Hamburg? Yes, darling, there's a marvelous bargain there now. That's where Paul's going. - Is it? - Oh, yes, he did mention something about Hamburg. You could be very useful to me for a change. If only you could talk to him, make him understand. - Ah, that's not easy, you know. - Well, you could try. At least you could keep an eye on him and stop him making us look like a lot of fools all over Europe. Yes. You're going to go to Hamburg. Well I wasn't planning on going immediately. Oh, but you must. Well I don't really think I can do it right now. Leave that to me. - And, if you're very clever... - Mm-hmm. There might be a little present for you. You know, I've never really liked little presents. What about a big one? All right, I'll go. - Yes? - Yeah. This place is dead. Yeah, on Saturdays it's worse than France. - Let's go, come on. - Wait a minute. You know, when I'm home, I'm convinced that boats, ships, are the one thing in the world I wanna see. Then, when I see them... Oh yes, I know that old refrain. Nothing is worth getting, and no place is worth... No, no, it's not exactly that. Something, something aggravates me when I see them close, too. Oh, you've got the Hamburg blues. No. It's because... They are what they were intended to be. They fulfill their function. At least back in the days when I was Jackie, and I worked at the Carlton Hotel, when I worked the Carlton Hotel, I fulfilled a function, huh? Anybody could rent me, do what they liked with me. And Christine did, with a bit of help from me. I still remember those old women and their greasy cocktails. All their Brandy Barbeloes and Singapore Slings. I can taste them to this day. And if you didn't drink them, they were offended. No tip. Well, but at least you graduated to champagne. - Oh yeah. - Yeah. Yes, now I'm Mr. Belling. The Champagne King. Yeah. That's an empty title, if ever there was one. Who is he? I haven't changed. Where's the... The thing that justifies my life? Doing nothing is a very tough job. It calls for a lot of concentration. I think you've done a very good job on yourself. When I first met you, you were a good-looking mess. Now, you've learned to do nothing with, with uh, distinction. It's a work of art. Come on, let's go. You go ahead. I wanna stay here a little while. All right. I'll see you tonight, where we arranged. We've been waiting here for hours. I'd like you to meet Fraulein Hildegarde. She's a lovely thing. Good evening. Ah, have drink? Yes. Would you like a girl? Why not? Leave it to me. My friend would like a girl. Uh, uh, uh,. Maiden. No, that's a nun. Uh, hostess, hostess. I know. Ah, but, extra, something special. Not just any old deutsche bimbo. Something... There, that one. - Ein moment. - Which one? I got an instinct for this kinda thing. Good evening. - Have a chair. - Well, here she is folks, wonderful. Yes, yes. Do you speak English? Oh, nein. A little. Not very important. You, you, very pretty. Do you like champagne? - Champagne? - Yes, do you like it? Oh, yeah... Well. Well, let's have some. Bottle of champagne please, my good man. Mmm. Make it Wagner, '55. Never on Saturday. Oh, I see that idle chatter will get us nowhere. What's your name? Me Paul. Me Paula. No, me Paul. Me Paula. She's called Paula. Oh! Let's drink to it. That was one of the most heartbreakingly beautiful conversations I've ever heard. Well that's a good beginning. Dance, madame? Paul and Paula will now take to the floor in one of their, yes, their inimitable numbers. Come on. Hey, what's happening back there, huh? Listen, I'm dead tired, let's go back to the hotel. That's the river bank, it's a romantic night. Hey, I need some fresh air. Let's walk around. No, no. Whiskey, whiskey at my place. Don't go to sleep now, I can't carry you. Hey, oh, come on! Yes, come on! - Let's walk. - Home. - Ha! - Oh, no! I like this place. I like this place! The grass feels good. Maybe shoes were the beginning of the whole trouble with people. Feet started to sweat as a protest. And the rot set in. I hate trees. Trees. Very pretty. Whoopee! Chris! It's Christine, she's coming upstairs! What? Oh, no, that's not funny Paul. Not. No, no. Ahoy, Lydia. Lydia. Not bad, what do you think dear? Mm, how 'bout Caroline? That's pretty. Too old fashioned, but I like it. Hey! Why don't you call her Christine after me? Erm, darling, it sounds more like a training ship than a yacht. Idiot. Anyway, there's plenty of time to think about that. Oh, I want every detail to be exactly right, dear. I thought you'd given up sugar? Oh. Tell me, you didn't answer my question last night. What question is that? How did he behave himself in Hamburg? Who? Paul? Who do you think? Oh, fine, fine, I guess. We, uh, just went to a restaurant. I showed him the docks and uh, that was it. You didn't discuss the business, now? No, no. No, no, no, no, no. I get the feeling, you know, he doesn't really like it when you try to force his hand too much. Yes? Why, what'd he say? And how is Jacqueline this morning? Very well, thank you sir. Nothing urgent, Jacqueline? I don't think so, ma'am. It's from Evelyn. Yeah, I know. You going? Oh, I might drop by. What's the meaning of this? I can't read German, darling, what does it say? It says that a young girl was murdered in Hamburg and someone seems to think you know something about it. What could I know about it? That's what I'm asking you. Do you know this girl? Darling, how should I know her? I'm not asking you why you should know her. But do you? No. No, I... No, I've... Never seen her before in my life. I don't believe you. Why should anybody send me a thing like this if there were no connection? Where does it come from? I can't make it out. But it was sent from France. I'm sure you know something about this. Darling, you're making a whole six act play. Now, look, do you think that the person who sent me this is gonna stop there? They're gonna send me some more and they're gonna give me more details. Now, you'd be much better off to tell me the whole thing. Now, my dear. Have you met this woman before? Good, well, now tell me. Where did you meet her? I didn't meet her. What I... Well what? I didn't have anything to do with her. But you know somebody who did. - Who? - I... I think, I think... That Paul may have been with her for a time. You mean you know he may have been with her for a time. And, and you, were you with them? Well we just had a drink together. And then what? Then I went back to the hotel. And you left Paul with her? For how long? Darling, what do I know? I just went to sleep. I see. The whole night. Well, well, well, well. - You're sure you had nothing to do with her. - Aw, come on. Come on, and Paul couldn't have had, either. He was dead drunk. It's a, it's a terrible thing. Ah, well, I'm no so sure. I think it's a very good thing. What are you gonna do? I'm gonna see your friend. Don't you tell him I told you. Lydia. Paul? Oh, what a surprise! I'd hoped that we weren't on speaking terms. Whatever made you think that? So, all my work went for nothing. Never mind. I shall have to dream up something else. Ah, you've got off to quite a flying start already. Oh yes? Oh, yes. Sit down. Hamburg. What a neat little stunt you pulled off there. I don't care much for puzzles before breakfast. Not even German ones? Quite a pretty girl. But of course newspaper photos are often deceptive. What are you talking about? Oh. What's it say? Oh, I'm sorry, I'd forgotten you were so bad at languages. Well, apparently, they found this young girl in the early morning. Someone had strangled her with a black stocking. And... That someone had apparently spent the night with her. Who did you get this letter from? A well-wisher... Who prefers to remain anonymous for the moment. And what did Chris tell you? Everything of course. After all, I am his wife. Well now, if I were the police, I'd be very interested to know that Fraulein... Fraulein?... - Paula. - Fraulein Paula's last client had undergone 17 shock treatments as a result of an incident with a strangled girl. Then why don't you inform them? Well, I wonder. Well, it must be because we're so fond of you, Christopher and I. And of course I believe that certain things should remain within the family, don't you? Yes. And also, I believe one favor deserves another. I get the point. You'll keep your mouth shut if I agree to sign. Well, it sounds like a reasonable exchange. Don't you think? Well, think it over. There's no great hurry. Or is there? Well, I must be going. Christopher hates to be kept waiting for breakfast. Are you trying to scare my customers? What do you want? I have to talk to you. You look dreadful. Get rid of him. I can't. Did you have a good time in Hamburg? I'm still waiting for your post card. Tell me... Do you think... Do you think there's something the matter with me? Go on. What do you mean go on? Well, tell me what's on your mind. Oh, we can't talk here. Why don't you buy me a drink when I close up? No, no, no. I have to speak to somebody now. Well can it wait for an hour? Look, look. You know me. You think I'm the kind of person who could do things, I mean terrible things, without even knowing that I'd done them? You mean if you were dead drunk? No. Not necessarily. Or yes, yes, I suppose I do. Do you have some engines, the electric ones? They're over there in that corner. Oh, thank you. Look, what's all this about being drunk and disorderly? Oh, no, no. - It's more serious than that. - What's the matter? - I can't suggest anything... - Look, I wouldn't have come at this time of day! You're hurting me! Be careful! Scotch, a double. What are you doing here? You mad at me? What are you doing here? I've got my spies everywhere. Christine made me tell her, you know. She's very good at that kind of thing. Well, what's it matter? It doesn't matter. Police can't pin anything on you. I mean... She'd have found out sooner or later. Christine won't say anything. Leave that to me. You know, you don't look so good. I better stick around. No. No, you don't. - I want to sleep. - And then... We'll go to Evelyn's little party together. Waitress. I'm not in the mood for parties. I'm not leaving you alone, buster. Give me another. Double. It's the best thing to do, don't you think? You just get depressed, hanging around on your own. Oh no, I, I need to sleep. Tell you what I'm gonna do. I'll let you sleep now, but you gotta promise to come to Evelyn's later. You're starting to talk like your wife. Okay? No! You got here too late. They're all asleep. A little piece of pepperoni and the secret is to put bacon with beef only, and never with mutton! And all of a sudden, you're in the top ten, and where do you go from there? Down! That's mathematics. But China's got nothing to do with it. It's the big oil people who are the ones to blame! Oh. It's too easy to put everything onto the party. Oh, oh. You don't realize that it's happening. And then, suddenly you find that the price of a kilo of asparagus has literally doubled. Hey, it's about time you showed up. I got a great thing going back here. No questions. See you later. So you did come. Yeah... You know, when I like someone, I'm a monster. And my instinct is to devour and I want more... And more... And more. Now, tell me all about everything, hm? What do you want to know? Little things like what'd you eat for breakfast? Hey! Watch it. Let's talk about me. Oh, yeah. That's a good idea. Who's that girl? Never ask that question in this house, not even afterwards. I know her, I've seen her somewhere, recently. But I can't think where. Well she's an actress, sort of a... No, no, no, no, no. I know her. All right, you know her. I hate her. I loathe her. Well, what's the matter with you? I know where it was, it was... What difference does it make? You haven't seen my husband, have you? - Come here. - Leave me alone. - Where? - He went over there. Where do you find all these creatures? Under rocks. They come out at night. Have a drink. - Leave me alone! - That wasn't very friendly. You want a kick in the pants, huh? That depends. Pardon me, come on... - Get away! - You have a very perverted friend. Come with me, Peppino, come with me. You monster! Get away, all of you! Ooh, violence. Now are you satisfied? We're all alone. Isn't that what you want? What do I want? Come on. Don't move. Stay furious. I'm quite calm now. Stay calm. But... Just give me... A little expression. Sorry. I'm, I don't feel it any longer. Give me some expression! You're not very funny. Oh, oh, yes I am. I am terribly funny. Oh, God, if you knew how really funny I am... And you're ridiculous. If you could only see how ridiculous you look. Get out. Get out of here. I took you for a man but you're nothing but a pathetic imitation. Get out! Never say that to me again. Let go of me! You're crazy! Get away from me. Stay away from me. I like my husband very much. When we're on our yacht. Just the two of us, with a Greek crew, I think. They make the best sailors. Oh, but a French cook. Okay, when? When? When? When can we get away? - Not just for the moment. - Not just for the moment. You've been saying that for months. We have to wait till this business is settled. We'll be old by then. Absurd. Anyway, you're not so badly off here, are you? It stinks of champagne. Plenty of people would love to be in your place, you know. I don't see why. Darling, what's the matter with you? You were so sweet when you woke up. It's you, hm? Hm? It's like being married, I don't know, it's like being married to a computer. What's more, I spoke to Paul. If you think you can refloat that American deal, you're barking up the wrong tree. So why can't we get out now? That's not what's keeping me here. Oh no, no, it all gives you such a kick, doesn't it? Empress of all you survey, plus me, your humble servant. I'm getting tired of your promises. Things have gotta start going my way now, and if they don't... And if they don't, what? I need some new shoes. And if they don't, what? You want one thing and I want another so what are you gonna do about it? You're not gonna get anywhere with me by trying to force my hand. - Oh, don't, don't, don't. Please, spare me the pain of that dreary, dreary old song. You know perfectly well that everything that I do, I do for you more than for me. Sure, sure, sure. One day I'll realize and I'll be glad. One day when I'm dead and buried, six feet under in my grave, I'll be glad, do you hear me, glad, glad. From Paris now, a news item that will without a doubt sadden all art lovers, whether French or foreign. The celebrated British artist, Evelyn Wharton, well-known in Paris for the very brilliant reception she has given and also for her truly great talent as a sculptress was found this morning, strangled in her studio in Paris. At the present moment, the identity of her assailant is unknown. Paul. Come on, Paul, let me in. Paul, the police can't prove anything. They don't know who was at the party. I'll say you left with me. Christine will say the same thing. It's so stupid. Why does a girl like Evelyn matter, anyway? We've gotta stick together, that's the important thing. Right, Paul? I shan't need anything more tonight, thank you. Very well, madame. Goodnight. Goodnight. Isn't Chris here? No. Or Jacqueline? No. Where is she? She's gone to Paris to fetch some things for me. Oh, but she'll be back any minute. You're alone, then. Yes. Why? Oh, there's something I've gotta tell you. I, I know already. And Chris does, too. It seems... That I've, I killed... Evelyn. I remember nothing about it. She, she was lying next to me when I woke up. Same thing must have happened with that German girl. I thought I was cured. Come in. But instead... It's getting worse. The attacks come more and more often. I, I'm going back to the sanitarium. Huh? Maybe they can still do something. Maybe? I'm not afraid to give myself up to the police. Don't think that. But that would just mean a very big noise in the papers. The result would still be the same. They'd still have to lock me up for treatment. And the scandal would close this place down. I take it you don't want that, do you? So what I came to ask you is this. Can I count on you and Chris to say nothing? Or better still... If they ask any questions, to say, to say I came back here with you both. Huh? Yes, we can say that. We could say that... Under one condition. You murderous little... Paul, wait till I've spoken to Chris about it. He, we... Get some paper and write down the Act of Transfer. I'll sign it. My name doesn't mean anything to me anymore. I'd have given it to you for nothing, if you hadn't tried to bargain. Oh, go on, go on. I thought you'd have been more eager. Yes, come in! Good evening, Mrs. Belling. - Jacqueline, oh it's you. - It took a long time. - I'm sorry to be so late. - But you're back at last. But the traffic was terrible, you know? The important thing is that you're here. Oh, would you be so kind as to type me up a document,... - Of course. - ...before you go to bed? Well, you can have the morning off tomorrow. Thank you. Thank you. That's it, there. There it is, ma'am. Thank you. You may go now. Good night. Now, if you'd be so kind just to sign it? There. Thank you. I fell. I remember falling. I... I remember... I went out like a light. How could I have killed Evelyn? I was paralyzed. I remember! What the hell are you doing here? Don't worry. I've locked the door. I've been waiting for you. We can't stay here. She's... In bed. Don't worry. Let's go upstairs. Come. Chris? I'm not crazy. Chris? Christine? Christopher! Jacqueline! Jacqueline! Chris? Jacqueline? Its Christine. She's dead. Quick. What... What are you doing here? What, what did you say? Christine is dead. What do you mean she's dead? Did you kill her? Of course he did! Who are you? And now he wants to kill us! No, Chris! He's a maniac! Kill him! Chris, you don't believe that. It wasn't me. It never was. None of them! How could you do it? You must really be crazy. Oh no, no. I'm not crazy. I know that now. I am not crazy. Watch him, he's dangerous! When I left her last night, she was with Jacqueline! - Kill him! - Jacqueline can tell you. - Kill him! - Now where is she? Can't you see he's crazy? Who is this woman? Where's Jacqueline? Kill him! No. Poor Chris. You're right, darling. It's just that I was so frightened. He's mad. Now, give me that gun. I'll do it for you. Wait a minute. Where's Jacqueline? All right, tell him. Tell him where Jacqueline is, Chris. Paul, how can you be sure you didn't kill Christine? I know it! I know I didn't kill her! I didn't kill anyone! Where's Jacqueline? I don't have to justify myself to you. Why don't you tell him? Are you ashamed? It was his idea. It as all a big joke and everybody fell for it. Aw, the things he promised me, Paul. If you only knew. "It will be just for a little while", he said. "And then... "We get all the money." You're lying, baby. You're lying. Yes. Take a good look. It's the last time you see the little secretary. I gave up my career for him. He'd land some old bag and push me aside. Until he needed me again. Yeah, we had some high old times together. I can tell you. You know that I love you, Chris. I did it for you. You mean you killed Christine? Yes. And... The other two as well? Yes, my love, for you. Listen to me, Chris. They'll think he did it. That's why I killed those two sluts. I worked it all out. Get rid of him and it will be as we've always wanted it to be. Give me the gun. We'll be free. No more lying. Let me have it! No, no! No! Oh, no! There's nothing to be afraid of! Blame him! Stop! Stop! Stop it, you'll kill her! - Stop, she fixed me up... - He made me whore for him. - ...with old whores! - Stop it! He made me whore for him. Chris! I stole from Christine and she loved me! You killed her! You're a monster! She killed Christine! Chris, stop it! Stop it! - My money! - All my money! - Money! - You'll kill her! - All my money! - Money!
