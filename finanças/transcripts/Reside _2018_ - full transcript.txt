Spirits are memories that refuse to fade away. They drift in the void of eternity... waiting for the moment to return. RESIDE Come. Come in. Don't be afraid. Come in. Don't be afraid. Don't be scared. Come now. Enter! Don't stop. Keep chanting. Keep going. Don't stop. Keep chanting! Kruea, go close the doors! Do it now! It's done, Madam. From now on, you must not open the front doors. What's just happened, Madam? A glitch. But everything's under control. Let's call it a day. You can leave. Madam! Come on! Shit, the lights go out every time it rains. Like in a horror film. What the hell! No reception. It still worked fine this morning. Now what... No phone. No Wi-Fi. Damn it. Are you all right, Prang? Sit still or the bleeding will get worse. Are you hurt? It won't kill me. Just cover the wound and I'll be fine. What about Madam? Is she all right? No. I've never seen anything so disturbing in my entire life. Don't say that. You're freaking me out. Auntie. By the way... - Who's that? - What? I don't know. Madam won't tell us. The lights are back! Finally! No, Krit! Madam told us not to open the doors. Open the doors! It's me! Dej! Soy. Dej! Dej, what took you so long? I'm sorry. My car got stuck in a mud hole on the way up here. It was raining like crazy. The road downhill has been cut by flash floods. We'll be stranded here for a while. Where's Madam? What happened? See for yourself. Come with me. During the ritual this morning something happened to Madam. We're at our wits end. It's good that you're here. Only you can handle this. Who're you? What do you want? Uncle Krit! Quiet! What's going on? It's quiet now. Dej, is everything okay? She's safe now. Krit, please remove these sacred threads. A stray spirit possessed Madam's body. Now it has left her. But it's not going anywhere and still wandering inside this house. Whoa, looks delicious. It's hot, careful. We have to get out of here. We can't just sit around doing nothing. Didn't you hear what Dej said? The road's kaput. We can leave the house but we can't go down the mountain. There must be a way! Help me think. We can't lounge around as if we were on a vacation. Watch your mouth! No one's on a vacation! I didn't say it was you. Why are you acting up? Acting up? Well, you'll act up too - if I spill the beans about... - What? What're you going to say? Stop it! Calm down, boys. At least we still have some food left in the house. Nop sit down and eat. Where's Dej? Infinity Spiritual Center, 2006 Dej! I've brought you boiled rice. Hot and tasty. Thanks... but I'm not hungry. You must eat something. Your hand is ice-cold! And you're still soaking wet. Go get changed, you'll get a fever. Come with me. I can't remember much... Not his face but I sure remember his smell. I was very young then, I didn't know what that smell was. When I grew up, I realized it was the tobacco smell. Aunt Kruea told me my father was a chain-smoker. When he came home, he'd kiss me on the cheeks. Until today I still remember how he smelled. Isn't it strange? My mother raised me. But... I keep thinking about my dad. Sometimes I even dream about him. It's funny... Do you think... Madam will be all right? Don't know. She should be. She'll wake up soon. She must've been through something like this before. It's so scary. Well... have you ever seen... a real ghost? Never. Me neither. And I don't want to. Like, I'm totally scared of ghosts. I wouldn't have joined this center had it not been for my aunt. Okay, put your shirt on. Prang! Dej! Prang! What happened! What happened! I heard my baby. Stop! You're imagining things again. I really heard our baby calling me mother. Nonsense! It's impossible! Prang. Please, Prang. Prang. Prang! Prang! Prang! Prang! Who are you? How did you get in? Is it gone? Yes, but you guys have to watch out. It'll look for another body to reside. Prang! Prang! Soy! Soy! Soy! Soy! Soy! Tada! I was just practicing! You brat! This isn't funny! - Little devil!, This isn't the time for a prank! - It hurts, auntie! I was just joking! - This is no time for a joke! - I want to lighten up the mood! Lighten up my ass! What an idiot! The nerve! Playing pranks on us now! Won't you stop it, huh? I told you to stop, you brat! Aunt Kruea... Back out! Soy! Leave my niece alone! Don't mess with my father! Father! Soy! I'll run you through everything that has happened. This morning... Madam performed a ritual to summon a spirit... to return to that body. But she didn't know that stray spirits had also slipped through the doors. Where were they from? What do they want? That I don't know. But my guess is... they're vagabond forest spirits that haunted the area. Madam's chanting accidentally woke them up. And now they're wandering inside this house... trying to kill us one by one. Why? Why do they have to take our lives? Seems like... they're preparing our bodies to receive another spirit that's trying to come in here. Spirits are like smoke that rises from a charred body and drifts around like nomads. The thin, weak smoke is quickly blown away by the wind. But sometimes the smoke condenses and refuses to fade away. As if they're waiting for the right moment. In the world of spirits there's a hierarchy, just like in the human world. The largest number of them are the spirits that died a tragic death. Victims of wars or deadly plagues. Or those killed in grisly murders. The violent horror of their dying seconds rattled the souls and left them hanging. These spirits grow stronger and refuse to dematerialize. They wander aimlessly drifting in all directions like smoke. The rootless spirits that died by such death will never find a home. They haunt forests and mountains. Waiting for the moment to return to where they once lived. The location of our center is in the path where these spirits travel. That's why I told you over and over to keep the front doors closed. Or these spirits will sneak in. But Madam herself left the doors open during the ritual. That's how the wandering spirits got in and attacked us. To summon a spirit, she had to leave the doors open. Or what she was calling wouldn't be able to enter. Now I'm curious... whose body is this? Why was Madam so determined to resurrect it? No! We shouldn't touch anything! The ritual isn't completed. If we disrupt it, something even worse might happen. In any case, we're stranded. We have to wait for Madam to wake up, then we can think of something. In the meantime, we need to protect our center and make sure no more spirits can force their way in. How is she? High fever, still unconscious. She called out to her mother though. Was she close to her mother? The girl has a sad childhood. Her mother died when she was 3, so I took her in and raised her. She has no other relatives. I'm her only family. She told me she couldn't remember her father. Did he die when she was little? He's still alive. He left her mother when she got pregnant. Never showed any responsibility, maybe never saw his daughter's face. But... Soy told me that when she was a girl, her dad liked to cuddle her and she remembered the smell of his cigarettes. I told her all of that... and she imagined a version of her childhood that wasn't real. She's like that because she never had a father. Do you know where her father is? Yes, I do. In prison. Really? What did he do? Do you really want to hear the story? Promise me you won't tell Soy. I don't want to ruin her memory. Prang! Look what I've found in the kitchen. What a surprise to have found a fine booze in this grim place. Come drink with me. Will you? It's getting dark, and I'm afraid of the dark. Prang. I've been wondering... how come a modern woman like you ended up in this spiritual center. It's so creepy. Really, aren't you afraid of ghosts? I am. But... what's scarier than the ghost is the human. Humans are the scariest creatures. Well... it's getting chilly after all day of non-stop rain. Whisky will warm us up. Care for a shot? No. I already quit. Her mother found out that he'd moved to Lampang with another woman. She went to find him. Not to bring him back, but to ask him to come and see his daughter. Because the girl kept asking where her dad was. They talked but ended up fighting. He got violent. That asshole... lost his temper. And stabbed Soy's mother to death. He was arrested and sent to prison. He's still... serving his time. Does Soy know any of this? No. I told her that... her dad disappeared when she was a baby and her mom... got hit by a car and died in Lampang. That's all she knows. Are you the elder sister of Soy's mother? No. I'm that asshole's sister. They lie in wait and ambush someone whose mind is weak. The smell of fear lets them know who's their target and when to attack. They'll possess that weak mind take over the body and reside there forever. So To beat them... you have to beat your own fear. So... what exactly is a spirit? A spirit is a memory. Vestiges of memory that live on after the body has decomposed. A spirit will always return to the person with whom it has a bond. If we have a deep bond with someone, when that person dies, they'll still reside in our minds, clinging on to us. They'll make themselves visible, walking, moving... smiling, laughing, crying. They'll live forever in our memories. Even though only we can see them. What if it was a painful memory? When we die... will that bond remain? Painful or happy memories... always connect us with someone. That means... death is not such a terrible thing. It's just a transition, a phase, an ongoing journey. Yes. That's what we call... a spirit. Prang. You scared me! Where were you last night? Why didn't you come home? Didn't I? Just answer me. I won't get mad at you. Did you sleep with Soy? Are you crazy? Just answer me, where were you last night? And why do you have a dozen missed calls from that girl? Prang... Did you sleep with her? Prang... The girl's young enough to be our daughter. Soy. Soy... Soy... Soy... What're you doing here? Come back inside! Come in. Soy... Mother... My mother's here to see me. Soy! Get in here! Let me go! I'm going to my mother! Soy! What're you doing! What're you doing to Madam! - Let go of me! - What're you doing to Madam! Dej, Stop! Stop! Let him go! What're you doing Nop, get out. - What're you doing? - He's trying to kill Madam. Who? Nop? - When? - Just now, I saw it! Bullshit. Why would he do that? Why? Why are you defending him? So what people are talking about is true. Talking about what? Talking about what? Tell me! Are you cheating on me? What the fuck is this! Let her go! Don't hurt Prang! I want her body! Mom, I'm hungry! You're all going to die! Mother! My child! Don't come near me! No! Some people try to act cool, but everyone knows what he's done. What! What the hell are you babbling about? Just watch your back. Don't let me catch you red-handed. Mother! Soy! Please wake up! Prang We have to run. This place is overrun by devils! We have to go now! Nop! Stop! That's not Prang! Auntie. Auntie. Take Soy into the living room. Nop! Nop, come in here. Nop! Where are you taking my child! My child! Soy... Soy. Prang. Auntie... You're awake... You're awake... Auntie... I'm so scared for your life. Prang... Prang... Prang. Dej. I'm pregnant. You've changed. You don't love me anymore. Dej. Dej. Can you get up? Slowly. What're we going to do now? There are three spirits terrorizing us now. The spirits of a father, a mother and a child. The Mother is locked out. But she'll try to break in to be with her child. It must be... around here somewhere. But we can't tell where it is and whom it will possess next. So you have to be careful. For God's sake! I've been extra-careful! It can enter any one of us at any time. Even Madam fell prey to it, these spirits are so powerful. Yes, but when Madam wakes up, she'll find a way to thwart them. Soy! Dej, help! Help me! Something pulled my legs, help me! I'm here, don't worry. You're safe now, I'm right here with you. Dej, watch out! Mother! My child! Little devil! Go back to hell! Go! What? What? What're you talking about? No! It's not true. No! Leave my niece alone, devil! Auntie... Get out! Get out! It's me, Soy. Stop! Don't come closer! What have you done to me? Soy... I'm hurt, please help me. I beg you, don't come any closer. I'm in pain... Soy, I'm sorry. Are you hurt? I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. Please forgive me. Auntie... I didn't mean to. I didn't... Am I dying? No, my child. No... When I die, I'll become a ghost. But I don't want to die. I'm scared of ghosts. My child... Auntie... I love you. I love you, my child. Mom. Mom, is that you? You're here for me? Soy! Soy! Filthy scum! I dare you to possess me. Enter me! Enter me! I have nothing left to lose. You want our bodies, right? Enter me! Enter me! Come and take my body. Wretched evil! Aunt Kruea, no! So you're here! Do you know what this is? Auntie! A sacred dagger. I will send you back to hell! Auntie! Prang, are you all right? Stop! Don't come near me. Prang, what's wrong? I said get the hell out! This is me, Dej. Dej? I don't know what you are. You may be the spirit that took over Dej's body. I'm clean. You have to trust me. Shut up! I don't trust anyone! You... All of you conspired to deceive me. A herbal drink, good for your pregnancy. Dej! Our new disciple, Nop. May I join you? - Cheers! - Cheers! Madam hired me to blackmail you. She wanted you and Dej to break up. But I can't do it... Because I love you. You've betrayed me... I know what you're up to. I have enough proof to put the blame on you. Never forget that. That hag killed my baby. If you really love me, let's run away together. But you have to do one thing for me first. You said you were curious Why Madam was so determined to perform the resurrection rite. And she was tight-lipped about the identity of that corpse. Or maybe... You've known all along who it is but kept the truth from us. Haven't you? Answer me! Prang... I have no idea... what you're talking about. Sure, Madam. I'll do that. What was that about? Madam didn't tell me. She just wants me to call everyone. It must be urgent. I can ask Dej what it's about. No, Soy! We do what Madam tells us to, no questions asked. Why isn't that hag dead? No way! Maybe she played a trick on you! Aunt Kruea just called. Madam calls a meeting at the center tomorrow morning. Impossible. I... I already did it. Didn't you know they're lovers? The baby wasn't yours. It was the devil's baby! Bullshit, mom. Why do you hate her so much? I want you to inherit the center from me. That's why you can't have a family. Enough! I'll run away with her. I'll get away from you! I want to live my own life! Son, don't do this! Don't do this! I already did it. How? A 30-year-old Thai man was found dead by drowning... Kruea, tell everyone to meet me at the center tomorrow morning. I need their help, it's important. The ritual to summon a spirit back to its body... is extremely dangerous. We won't attempt it unless it's absolutely necessary. It requires a strong collective mind-force to succeed. You're a ghost just like us! No! It's not true! Come. Come in. Don't be afraid. Come in. Enter. Don't be scared. Enter. Come in. My child! Mother! Prang. Dej. Dej! I've never stopped loving you. Now or ever. Remember that... A spirit will always return to the person with whom it has a bond. If we have a deep bond with someone, when that person dies, they'll still reside in our minds, clinging on to us. They'll make themselves visible, walking, moving... smiling, laughing, crying. They'll live forever in our memories. Even though only we can see them. Get out, you wretched! Leave my son alone! Mom, where's dad? Your dad won't come back again Why won't he come back? He's dead, he was killed in a war. Dad! Don't cry, child, soon we'll follow him. Be strong, this too shall pass. Remember this tree, this is where we died. One day in the future, you, me and your father will meet here again. Remember. My son... Mom. You're all right now. The worst is over. Let's get out of here. Painful or happy memories... always connect us with someone. That means death is not such a terrible thing. It's just a transition, a phase, an ongoing journey. Yes. That's what we call... a spirit.
