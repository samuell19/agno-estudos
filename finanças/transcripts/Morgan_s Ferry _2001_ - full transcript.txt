[crickets] [bird chirping] VONNIE (VOICEOVER): What I know now is that fate will always find you. No matter that I cut myself off from the world not singing a song, not caring to. I believed nothing could ever hurt me again. [laughs] That was before fate stumbled into my yard and walked through my front door without knocking. [music playing] [water sloshing] Wait. Goddamn. Go this way. No. Shit. DARCY: We could've followed that gravel road. We wouldn't have to cut through this goddamn jungle. It's a swamp, you idiot. Sam, my foot's real hurt. Get in. Hold on. Push him in. For god's sake, row. [inaudible] that way. Get the rope on, Monroe. Gah. Go, go, go, go, go. [sirens] SAM: You in? [sirens] Gah, shit. We're going the wrong way. Monroe, we're going the wrong way. Shit. Nowhere. We're in the middle of nowhere and it's your fault. MONROE: Shut up, Darcy. Oh, shit. God. Whoa. Damnit. Oh, shithead. Yah! God. Shit. Shit. Boat's full of water. DARCY: Sam, there's a hole and the boat's sinking. Oh, just plug it up then. [music playing] Ah, shit. [heavy breathing] MONROE: Damn! Shit. [birds chirping] What do we got? Nothing. All right. Let's go. Come on. Shit. OK. Shit. (WHISPERS) Look. Sam. Shit. Sam, look. [thud] Huh. Goddamn it. Damn. Why'd we have to cut through this goddamn graveyard? Shut up. [inaudible] Look, somebody opening up a fresh grave means there's somebody around here. It's open but it ain't fresh. That dirt's dried out. Get out from there. Y'all can go chase spooks. Me, I'm going to go in there and see if there's a can of beans and a mattress left in that dump. There was light. VONNIE (VOICEOVER): What happened that late October changed most everything. Not on the outside, of course. In town, mothers of ornery and high-spirited daughters still tell them to mend their ways, less they end up like crazy old Vonnie. I guess some things will never change. [door handle jiggling] [crash] [gasps] Darcy. VONNIE (VOICEOVER): But what I'm talking about is bigger than all that. I'm talking about how what I feared most found me. What I tried to shut out, broke in. It's like I called it on. Y'all going to have to come an understanding about who is in charge here. Yeah? It sure as hell ain't you. Fellas. Food. In the kitchen. Uh! You live here alone? Mm. We're going to eat and we're going to leave. You make me mad, it's you that'll be sorry. You understand? [heavy breathing] SAM: Hey, Monroe? Say, why don't we just eat and get on out here? Where you going? Get in there. DARCY: Come on. MONROE: You want her to go running for the Sheriff? SAM: It's going to be sunrise. Let's change these clothes and get out of here. DARCY: I'm going to get me something to eat first. [pots banging in kitchen] MONROE: Where's a radio at? [bags rustling] [radio stations changing] Wilbur, you there? They must have took Elnora's boat. They must have took Elnora, too. Nah. She's in the hospital. That cut on her foot mending right. They'll be making for the ferry lickety split. Get Nub out of bed. Wake up everybody on Old River Road. Tell them to keep an eye out. [nature sounds] How far you reckon it is to Morgan's Ferry? Must be at least 30 miles from here. Well, I can't wait to get across that river. No more bosses, no more dogs, no more picking them goddamn potatoes all day long. So what are we going to do what that lady? Lady. Damnit! Awh, shit. Now look what you've done! Now she'll be back with the sheriff and the sheriff will have dogs! - She's gone. I don't need you. No? You needed me to break out, didn't you? Needed me to get all mangled in that wire! I don't need you now. Hey, them dogs ain't going to have any trouble finding us now, Monroe. I'll find a way to throw them off. Oh, always figuring, ain't you? Always talking, always knowing all the answers! Yeah, well someone's got to and you ain't smart enough. You get this through your head. I ain't going back. I'm out and I'm staying out. Anyone gets in my way, I'll kill them. [rooster crows] [cow moos] VONNIE (VOICEOVER): It seems crazy now, but fate makes you do strange things-- things you couldn't explain to other people, or even yourself. I don't know why but nothing was going to make me leave. Don't you have good sense, lady? Get out of my garden. Even a slug knows enough to be scared when it ought to. You should know. Monroe, you said she wasn't important. Maybe she is. Can we just get out of here? I don't know why you didn't go for the sheriff, lady. But I ain't giving you another chance. You didn't give me the first one. Me and my friends money. What you need is more than money. I ain't asking, I'm telling. You ain't doing no good, Monroe. You can do better? Where's the cash? I don't keep cash. Everybody keeps cash. Can't keep what you don't have. Can't keep what you do have from the looks of it. Oh, shut up. Sam. SAM: What? DARCY: She's got to have some money around someplace. You make her talk. Thought you wanted me to shut up? Shut up! SAM: What am I supposed to do? [sighs] All right, look here. Suppose I told you that-- I've had it with this shit. SAM: Monroe. [horn beeping] Who's that? Vonnie, you OK? My cousin and her husband drive out here a couple of times a week to see if I'm OK. When they get out, we'll get their car. [horn beeping] They ain't getting out. Vonnie! Damn. She could strip paint off the walls with that voice. Why ain't they getting out? VONNIE: Never do. SAM: Why? VONNIE: Don't like them, don't matter. Come on. Still here! Okie dokie! Damn. Morning, parson. [honking] SAM: Why don't-- why don't they pick up a phone? Why do they drive? Don't have one. Monroe. Who's that? It's hard to say. Can't see from here, can't come over there because you tied me up. [knocking] [humming] Good day to you, sister. How do? I have here, the word of the Lord. Can't save your soul if you don't know how. [laughs] To tell you the truth, I ain't particularly worried about my soul right at the moment. PARSON: Earthly troubles pale beside the threat of eternal damnation, sister. Probably. But suppose I was having some troubles in this world. What then? Everything you need is right here. Good. Um, say, where's that part that talks about folks being where they're not welcome? You mock me, sister? Oh, Lord God, Jehovah, who hast sent me forth to minister to the weakened, and the heathen, and the unrepentant, give me the strength to meet Satan face to face and triumph in the name of Jesus. Argh! [heavy breathing] Where's your car? Died out on the road. The Lord took it. Now I see why. Oh, sweet merciful Jesus-- Shut up. PARSON: --thank you for saving me from being the instrument by which these jailbirds-- Shut up! Shut up! Shut up! [inaudible] MONROE: Gah. [crack] Uh! The hell did you do that for? Monroe! Put him in that dug up grave. Come on. [music playing] VONNIE (VOICEOVER): I don't know why I just didn't send the parson on his way like I did my cousin and her husband. I guess one part of me was looking for salvation and the other just couldn't help tempt the fury's. Seems like I've been doing that my whole life. My daddy, rest his soul, could attest that. Hey. Did you ever notice how dumb women are? Leave it be, Darcy. And never shut up, neither. Just keep on running at the mouth like anybody in their mind wants to hear them yammer, yammer yammer! Would you quit and give me a hand so we can get him in face up? Oh, just dump him in. I ain't touching no dead preacher. That ain't respectful. We got to do it right. - Well, I ain't touching it. - Argh. Mm. Uh! Nothing I hate worse than a preacher. VONNIE: I reckon you do look a might peaked. Probably your conscience. Ain't either. You just keep your mouth shut and we'll get along fine. What you want ain't worth a bucket of spit. Hey! Keep your hands to yourself. Yeah? What you going to do about it? [crunch] Ow! [screaming] VONNIE (VOICEOVER): In a peculiar way, I have that little weasel to thank for everything that happened. I mean, they were about to head out. It's not that he saved my life exactly. It's more that I was wasn't really living before. DARCY: Oh! Ow! It's-- oh, it's broke! All right now. DARCY: It's broke. I know it's broke. That bitch broke my broke foot! Shh. Calm down. DARCY: Oh! Ow! SAM: Now that ain't broke. No, it feels fine. No, it feels like it's broke is how it feels! [motor turning over] Come one, now. Put it down. What you doing, Sam? I got to lie down. We got to see you can walk, Darcy. Shit. [motor turning over] Oh. Put a little weight on it. Oh, Sam, put me on the couch. Put me down. I can't do this. Monroe, she broke my foot! Come on. We got to push the car to get it started. You, too. DARCY: Easy. After you. MONROE: I said you, too. If you get it started, he won't wait for you. He's just going to drive off and leave you here. MONROE: Push the damn car. Why don't you get out and push and she can steer? That's the stupidest idea I ever heard. Well, it ain't no stupider than letting you do it. All right, on three. 1, 2, 3 push. [music playing] [motor sputtering] [backfire] [backfire] VONNIE: [sighs] Dead. Get back in there. It's dead, Monroe. [motor turning over] MONROE: Got to find that money. [music playing] [rustling and glasses breaking] Damnit. I told you keep an eye on that woman. You ought to quit wandering off like that. Needed some fresh air. Y'all stink to high heaven. Why ain't-- why ain't you scared? This is my land, my home. I won't back down from a bunch of thugs. I ain't a thug. Mm-hmm. Sheriff just saw you smiling and slapped you in the county jail for being too good-natured. Judge and jury come along and say, yes, siree, that there boy, well, he's just too nice. We'd better put him in the county farm. Of course, I could be wrong. Being mean does take some intelligence. All right. You've got no call to make fun of me. I'm just trying to make sure no one gets hurt. Bit late for that. You shouldn't talk about people like they're worthless, you know, because that ain't right either. Woman's crazy. [music playing] Are you ever planning to get up off my sofa? I wouldn't be on your damn sofa if you hadn't broke my damn foot! Don't eat out of the pot. Is that for me? Mm-hmm. If you eat at all, you're going to sit at the table proper. Damnit, lady. You got no good sense! You got to get up sometime unless you want us to leave you here when we go. And when's that going to be? When you tell me where the money is. Don't have any money. Anybody got a house on a farm, got to have money. [crickets] [sighs] [door handle jiggling] Hmm? [loud banging] [crash] [clothes ripping] You should have given us the money, lady, so we could go. SAM: You are not fit to live, Monroe. Get your hands off of me. You don't want to mess with me. I sure don't but I will! You don't got to go killing everything just because it don't go your way. MONROE: I wasn't planning on killing her. [door slams] [heavy breathing] [rooster crows] [music playing] [cow moos] [horse neighs] [chickens clucking] Morning. Why ain't you gone? Because Darcy can't walk. VONNIE: : That may be stopping him and you, but I don't imagine that's what's keeping the big fella. Yeah, Monroe still thinks you holding out. Me, I think you about broke as us. We're going to be leaving soon. Good. I'd stay downwind of the sheriff if I was you. Maybe next time you'll get lucky. DARCY: I can't do this. My foot hurts. SAM: Now, we got to get cleaned up. Can't get very far looking like his. Besides it might make you feel better. DARCY: Well, I ain't going to strip in front of her. You got nothing I want to see. [water sloshing] After I get dried off and dressed, I'm leaving. Can't leave me, Monroe. Pfft. Hey, Miss Vonnie! Peabo here. What? Is the old man blind? SAM: He must be. VONNIE: : How do, Peabo? How's the back? PEABO: Old, like the rest of me, Miss Vonnie. Your turnips come up yet? VONNIE: Yeah. Well, they're working on it. PEABO: You hear about them jailbirds escaping? VONNIE: Sure did. PEABO: Mm. Here's my list for Mr. Levitt. There you go. What? VONNIE: Sorry, I just gave you the wrong list. That's all. PEABO: Oh. VONNIE: Just tell Mr. Levitt the usual, OK? Yeah. You know the sheriff and his men are stomping all around there in the woods up there near my place. He said they're going to work their way from there, clear down to the ferry. I bet the gators got them boys in the swamp. VONNIE: Suppose so. You best be getting on. PEABO: All right. Well, I'll be back along by sunset, I reckon. (SINGING) If I had wings like Noah's dove-- You're not kill him, are you? What in the hell are you doing? Trying to get that [inaudible] to shut up. What the hell is the matter with you? That could be us on that wagon getting the hell out of here. You know they'll be setting the sheriff between us and the ferry. Where else you want to go? Back to the farm? In to town? [horn honks] [background conversations] [nature sounds] So whose clothes am I wearing? My daddy's. Oh. That him? VONNIE: Yep. Never knew my daddy. Never knew anyone who was kin to me. Could be you didn't miss much. What did he do to make you hate him so much? Say, why was that grave open? My daddy dug it for me when I was born. Said there wasn't any point in saving any money for my school because I might be stupid. And there wasn't any point in saving any money for my wedding because I might be mean and ugly but this thing here, this was the one thing he was sure I needed sooner or later. If it was up to him, it would have been a lot sooner. Monroe. Monroe! MONROE: Shut up. We got to take that wagon. MONROE: Sheriff's still out there. Could be he's moved on. He don't find us where he's looking, he's going to look someplace else. PEABO: (SINGING) Wade in the water. Wade in the water children. We're sitting ducks here, Monroe. At least with the wagon, we got a chance. PEABO: (SINGING) --water. Children wade in the water. God's going to trouble the water. Oh, I say, wade in the water. Say! Miss Vonnie, Peabo is back. I'm right here. Oh. Don't ever let them tell you that moonshine is as good as store bought because it just ain't so. [laughs] Hmm. They here, ain't they? Ah! Come on, Darcy. Come on, Sam! MONROE: Darcy, get in. DARCY: Come on. We're on our way now. (LAUGHING) Old mule don't know how to go to no place but town and home. They'll be back. There's a fork in the road right up here around this bend. The road to the left will take us right to the ferry. Once we get there, y'all going to have to find us a car and me a doctor. [nature sounds] I told you. That old mule got out-stubborned to death. Tell that nigger to stop staring at me. He ain't staring at you, Darcy. He's blind. Blind, my ass. Look at him. What you staring at, boy? Digger coming for you. You can't hoo-do me, old man. Digger coming. Daddy spent his whole life trying to hoo-do me with that jeezy shit. Happiest day of my life was when they put him in the grave. Ain't no crazy old [inaudible] starting on me now! Come on. [music playing] Hey. You know, yesterday I was unhitching Peabo's mule and putting him in the shed. And Darcy really didn't want to wait but I did it anyways. I-- Peabo will appreciate that. [sighs] That's him getting up now. You want to go upstairs and help him find his way down? DARCY: [coughing] Look, I know you're not used to helping anyone but that little weasel out there on my sofa, but it isn't as hard as you might think. DARCY: Sam. SAM: In a minute, Darcy. Now! I said in a minute. DARCY: I have to go to the bathroom now. Forget your friends, one of these days you're going to find yourself forgotten. You best remember, I'm the only one ever treated you like family in this world. Me and you taking care of each other all these years. You lose sight of that? All you see is that old nigger and that crazy woman? Their not your long lost momma and daddy, Sam! Them two will turn you into the sheriff faster than a snake can swallow an egg and never think twice about it. Shut up! I had done had a craw full of that shit. What do you think the whole world should not have nothing better to do than worry itself sick trying to find ways to make you happy? Let me tell you something. I figured it out, it can't be done. And I am sick of trying. MONROE: Ah, shut up, you two. Tell him he's taking me to the ferry. He can hear you. I take all of you or none. You ain't exactly in a position to lay down rules. You kill me, who is going to take you to the ferry? [music playing] [rooster crows] VONNIE (VOICEOVER): After daddy died, I remember feeling relieved to be alone and this was sort of the opposite. Somehow the quiet seemed a lot louder after all that yammering. Funny how the body gets lonely. [music playing] [horse neighs] Let's go. Go [inaudible]. Shit. Monroe! Get off. Get off. [punching sound] [grunting] Uh. SAM: Come on. [music playing] I think this is yours. Mm-hmm. CARLEEN: Vonnie! Vonnie! You OK, Vonnie? Why's the parson's car still here? Momma, he took me tomahawk. Neh, neh, neh, sissy. Daddy, make him stop. All right now, children. I told you not to-- CARLEEN: Vonnie! I'll be. CHILDREN: No! Give it! She's never come out of the house before. What do you reckon she wants? I don't know. CHILDREN: This is mine. Now, kids, stop that this minute! I want you to sit down and behave for your cousin, Vonnie. You hear? How do, Carleen? Joe Ed. Evening. Y'all care to come in and have some tea? [laughs] I don't mind if I do. Mm-hmm. That's mighty fine tea, cousin Vonnie. CARLEEN: Mm-hmm How come you got your sofa cushions on the porch instead of the sofa? Will you two please stop acting like poor white trash before I snatch you bald-headed? I hear tell some men escaped from the county farm. Oh my, yes. And Sheriff Barnwell says they are real dangerous-- a murderer and two armed robbers. Had the dogs out looking for them but they lost the scent in the swamp. He figures they'll head to the river so he deputized a couple of the Johnson boys to keep an eye out on the ferry, but ain't nobody heard nothing yet. Those jailbirds could be right outside the door and nobody would never know it till it was too late. Why in the world this town let them put-- VONNIE (VOICEOVER): You think I would have known better than to look to my kin for solace-- or even a little company. Like I said, sometimes fate makes you do things you can't explain. Of course, now I know. I was waiting on what came next. Been looking in the wrong direction. [music playing] Whoa. We real close. I can smell the river. All right. We'll wait until dawn and then we move. Monroe? Monroe! FERRY MASTER: Dark night, huh boys? We got some [inaudible] coffee. You know, the escapees could be real close by. You gonna see 'em. They could sneak up here real quiet. [bang] [laughs] [nature sounds] [metal pipes falling] [gunshot] Turn the wagon around. [gunshot] Do it. [gunshot] [heavy breathing] [gunshot] I ain't going back. [gunshot] FERRY MASTER: This man's dead. You boys better hope you got the right one. You're in a mess of trouble. Them badges don't give you the right to shoot whatever moves. SAM: They shot Monroe He's dead. Whoa. The ferry was guarded. They shot Monroe. Shoot him, too? No. [inaudible] graveyards, niggers that shy. Come on, Darcy. Ow. [inaudible] Step coming up right here. Mm-hmm. [footsteps] [screen door opening] [singing quietly] He just gave up all of the sudden. Man, I shouldn't have yelled at him. Nobody ever died from getting yelled at. Ain't nobody ever took care of me but Darcy. He doesn't take care of you. Always telling you you're stupid, making you wait on him. He's looking out for himself, not you. He can't help the way he is. You don't know nothing about it. It's not your fault. Probably gangrene. Come on, Darcy, you got to eat. [raining] And he will rule them with a rod of iron! As the vessels of a potter will they be broken in shivers. Whoa. Darcy. Be watchful and strengthen the things which remain, that are ready to die! - Shh. Hey. What-- what's he saying? Whoa. The Revelation. DARCY: Four beasts had each of them, six wings about him, and they were full of eyes within! For the great day of his wrath has come! The great day of his wrath has come! SAM: What's he saying? DARCY: The great day of his wrath has come! SAM: Quiet, Darcy. DARCY: Please Father, forgive me my sins! Please Father, forgive me my sins! SAM: [inaudible] [music playing] VONNIE (VOICEOVER): You can call it serendipity or happenstance with the stars. It's so clear to me now. But what I couldn't know then was that I was getting closer to the reason why those three broke in through my front door and no one else's. He's going to hate being on top of a preacher. Aren't you going to say anything? Eh. He hated all that stuff. Still don't seem right not saying anything. Lord, he wasn't much. He was kind of angry but meant no harm. His daddy was a preacher. Lord, forgive this here sinner and take him to your bosom, if you've a mind to. Amen. Hmm. Sure is a lot of people in that grave. Mm-hmm. That boy out there-- Which one? Dead one or the live one? The live one. He ain't a problem to nobody but himself. Just thought you might like to know. Finished? Mm-hmm. Mighty fine, Miss Vonnie. Sure do appreciate what you've done for us, Peabo. I won't forget it. See you next month, Miss Vonnie. So what you going to do now? Can I stay? Sheriff's no fool. He'll just start at the river and work his way back. Yeah, well it's a big stretch to cover. It could take some time. A day, a week, it all comes out the same. When he comes for me, I'll go with him but until then, I would like to stay. I don't know what you think those badges entitled you to do, but you're goddamn lucky it was the right one you shot. Man didn't even have a toothpick on him and you put seven bullets in him. If I come back out here and find another dead man you morons are using for target practice, I'm going to fry your butts. You understand? Do you understand? I know these boys here don't know shit from Shinola but you ought to have more sense. DALTON (OVER RADIO): Sheriff, you've got to pick up. Go ahead, Dalton. DALTON (OVER RADIO): Coroner McKeen was here. He wants to know if you can come by. He found something on that dead escapee. He wants to talk to you about it. Now, I can meet you there. - Stay where you are. I'm leaving here now. DALTON (OVER RADIO): Well, I can meet you there. I said, I'll take care of it. Billy Ray, don't ever do that again. Don't ever call me down that way in front of folks, especially not them boys. You watch them boys closely, Caleb, or I'm going to do more than call you down. You can travel a lot faster now that you're alone. Mm-hmm. Cities and people, high times beyond the river. Yeah, I reckon. Where were y'all heading? Eh, you know, cities, people, high times. And what were you planning on doing once you got there? [sighs] Well, you know Darcy was doing all the planning. He'd been in Memphis once. I've never been there. Still want to see it? Yeah. I reckon Memphis would be just fine. Sure. You can give Elvis Presley a run for his money. Oh, come on. Which room am I supposed to take that anyway? Whichever one you want, except mine. You know, I never had a room of my own, and I want to thank you. [music playing] [snoring] [hammering in the background] Come on, now. I could do that for you. You hungry? Yes ma'am. You ever do this kind of work before? I've done just about everything that makes you sweat and don't pay good. Hey. Someone's coming. Miss Vonnie. VONNIE: How you do, Sheriff? SHERIFF: Parson Williams car doing out front? Broke down. SHERIFF: Where's the parson? Wherever he got to after he left here. Johnson boys killed one of them convicts out at the ferry. Good. One less to look for, then. He wasn't wearing convict clothes. Is that so? His shirt had your daddy's initials in the collar. Whatever happened to Vonce's clothes? Gave them away after he passed. Who'd you give them to? Some tramp that was passing through. Then how'd that shirt end up on a convict escaped only a few days? I don't rightly know, Sheriff. Well-- How come you didn't tell him I was here? How come you didn't come out? [music playing] [sizzling] [water running] Sheriff won't be coming this soon. Ain't looking for the Sheriff. I'm going to see if it's going to rain. Want to see if that patch holds. Dinner's getting cold. [laughs quietly] You ever been any place but here? Town. You ever wanted to go someplace else? Not much. [sighs] You happy? Don't think about that much either. Miss Carpenter. No need to call me miss. I'm not that much older than you are. Ma'am? My name is Vonnie. There's no need to call me ma'am neither. Vonnie, your kinfolk coming back here anytime soon? Lord, I hope not. That Carleen, she could talk the hind leg off a donkey. They stopped by the other day after y'all left. Why didn't you tell them about me, and Darcy, and Monroe? Couldn't get a word in edgewise. [raining] [music playing] [knocking] Come in. Well. I know. [music playing] [hammering] [birds squawking] Joe Ed. What's that, Joe Ed? Where'd cousin Vonnie get the money for hired help? I don't know. CARLEEN: Morning. How do? Who's that? A boy that's passing through. Well, what are you paying him with? Room and board. We'll, it's dangerous taking in strangers, cousin Vonnie. You remember what happened to the Watleys over at Moss Fork? They took in that hired man and he-- --and he took an axe to them because a voice told him to. I'll be OK. Thanks, y'all, for stopping by. Come on, Carleen. I got that, uh, Lions Club meeting to get to. You reckon they'll tell? Depends if they figure it out. - How smart are they? - Not very. Can I help you folks? - Is Sheriff Barnwell here? - No ma'am. He's out at the ferry. You got pictures of those men that escaped from the county farm? You seen them? One of them, maybe. Don't know until we see the pictures. DEPUTY DALTON: Well? And you're sure Sheriff Barnwell is not around? Uh, ma'am, if you've seen one of these men, it is your duty as a citizen to report it to the nearest law enforcement officer, and that would be me. CARLEEN: Him. We have seen him. [music playing] You don't have to work all the time. Don't know how to do nothing else. You should be careful. She can be dangerous. You a good girl, ain't you? Yeah. She used to belong to Earl Shurtleff two farms down. She kicked him in the head and ran off. SHERIFF: Now, Miss Vonnie, your kin say you got a man out here-- a man I'm looking for. I had a boy out here help me around the place. Where is he? Gone. Where to? You keep on asking me where everybody is, Sheriff. If they're not here, I don't know where they are. Leave in a hurry, did he? I wouldn't say so. Just finished up and moved on. It's funny how he finished up and moved on right after Joe Ed and Carleen saw him. Are you calling me a liar? No, ma'am. It's mighty peculiar, is all. How old is this boy? I'd say about 30, maybe 35. No boy at all, then. Have a name? I reckon. Didn't ask. If this boy of yours is the one I'm looking for, he's a dangerous criminal. He robbed a gas station over at Webster's Landing. Near about scared poor old Jake Finley out of 10 years growth. Jake Finley would be scared of his own shadow. It don't make it right to pull a gun on him and take his money. No, it don't, sir. You understand, I'd like to have him back. I know you do, Sheriff. I'd like for you to come to town with me and look at some pictures. Seems to me that Carleen and that dishrag of a husband she's married to already identified that boy. Yes, ma'am. But I'd like for you to identify him, too. Sheriff, I have a lot of work to do here. Now if you want me to go looking at pictures, you're just going to have to bring them on out here. I'll do that. Could have gotten yourself in trouble doing that. I'm going to head back into town and he's going to pick me up on his way back out here. [sighs] You could try to make the ferry. Monroe got himself shot trying to make it-- Monroe was a fool. PEABO: (SINGING) Rocking my soul in the bosom of Abraham. Rocking my soul in the bosom of Abraham. Oh, rocking my soul. Mm-hmm. Hey, mule! Hey, Miss Maggie! [music playing] [deep breath] PEABO: Miss Vonnie. Miss Vonnie! Peabo's here. Oh, Miss Vonnie! Hey, Peabo. Hey. I heard the sheriff pass by my place. Thought you might have a need of me and the wagon and this old mule. (SINGING) If I had wings like Noah's dove, I'd fly up the river right to the one I love. Fare thee well, my honey, fare thee well. [humming] You mean to tell me, you left my cousin out there all alone with that-- that criminal? Now calm down, Carleen. There wasn't anybody there but her. He probably threatened her and she was scared to tell you! Don't seem likely. Now that's the truth, Carleen. I mean Vonnie would be likelier to hand that boy his head than be scared of him. Carleen, if I thought that Miss Vonnie was in any danger, I'd be there and not here. Well, what I want to know is what do we pay our taxes for? We did our duty. We came and told you what we've seen and I, for one, expected you to get out there and protect my kin! Well, I did tell miss Vonnie that I'd come back by and have her look at these pictures. I was going to do it tomorrow but if it'll make you feel better, I'll do it right now. [music playing] Miss Vonnie? Miss Vonnie, it's Sheriff Billy Ray Barnwell. [music playing] Stop right here. How do, boys? Caleb around? This is a stupid idea. Listen, if we can't outsmart the Johnson brothers, we deserve to get shot. Well, how do, Vonnie? How do? Ain't seen you since your daddy's funeral. I have a boy here, needs to get across the river. First run's at sunup. Be about 30 minutes. You come on and have some coffee, huh? You know, we had a shooting out here some nights back. Them fellows over there, they killed one of them escapees. So I hear. Thank you. And the sheriff ain't been able to find the other two. Must not be looking in the right place, then. I reckon. Had a good idea, putting men out here to guard this place. Only way out at this end of the county is by ferry. If I was to spot one of them convicts, all I got to do is pick up the phone and call the sheriff. Dalton. Deputy Dalton. [neighing] [crash] [car turning over] Damn. [music playing] Morning, Bobby. Can I use your phone? Yeah. CALEB: Hey, young fellow. Over here. First run's at sunup. Looks like sunup up to me. [music playing] [ringing] Don't worry, boys. They'll ring back. Come with me. Come on, there's freedom across the river. Freedom is where you belong and I belong here. But I do thank you. And I hope with all my heart that you find your belonging place. When I get across, if anyone ever asks me if I got family, I'm going to say, yes, I do. And they're right here Morgan County. [music playing] [laughs] VONNIE (VOICEOVER): It's not so much that I miss him-- that would be too simple. It's more that everything feels different now. I mean, it's the same farm and people in town still call me crazy old Vonnie. I never knew how a choice could show you to yourself. I guess daddy was right after all about me needing that grave. But he'll just have to be content for now with the present company. [music playing]
