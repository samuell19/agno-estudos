I'm floating gently through the sky. It feels so good. And...I'm naked. I'm always naked. I feel just like a little girl. I stretch out my arms and legs, and fly across the sky. But I'm a little embarrassed. I am naked, after all. Is someone watching? Tell me! I'm floating. Like a cloud. It feels so good. Don't move! Yes. Stay like that. Then... ...very slowly. Um...it's like electricity. - Pleasure? - Yes. I feel that pleasure...all over my body. No! That's far enough! I even see him in my dreams. My clothes get blown off. And I go straight to outside. Please. Tell me. How can such a heavy thing fly? FLIGHT ATTENDANT SCANDAL HOLD ME LIKE A BEAST PRODUCER: YOSHITERU YŪKI I'm an assistant purser. I preside over a ten-person cabin crew. SCRIPT: HISASHI WATANABE OSAMU MURAKAMI I manage in front of the crew, but the truth is... ...flying terrifies me lately. I can't fly. It must be stress. CAST: KEITO ASABUKI TOMOKO AI MAKOTO YOSHINO SHIGERU MUROI DIRECTOR: MASARU KONUMA - See you. - Bye. What are you doing? You're a real son of a bitch, aren't you? What the hell? You're kidding always. I didn't do anything. I want a man like a Lockheed L-1011. YS-11 for me. Like a potato. Flying makes me sleepy. How about you? Me? Uh, well, I... Hi. Good work. You all look tired. Don't say that! Don't party too much. LET'S HAVE A "MIDNIGHT FLIGHT" TOMORROW. FROM, YOUR PILOT PRINCE Dead head. Yep, really dead. Jetlag hits you hard, Aya. It's not right. We flew to San Francisco yesterday and got back to Tokyo today. But somehow three days have passed. Where did that extra day go? Sleeping at the bottom of the ocean. So we're Rip Van Winkle? You're Rip Van Dinkle. Do you ever stop talking? Okay, but anyway... If it takes three days, I have to make up that sleep. You're low-energy. I feel great. You're just glad your first flight is over. Bah! Yours was only six hours. What're you saying? At least we can shit talk outside of work. Right! That's our Assistant Purser. What? You never complain about work. We should forget about work on our days off. Really? I feel like I'm still flying! When you girls hit 2000 hours you'll know what I mean. - 2000 hours? - It happens fast. I'll be married before then! Take it easy! You have to get 10,000 hours first. Shut up! Flight attendant's uniforms are like marriage magnets. Men are brand-oriented, too. - For wives? - Yep. Tomorrow there's a mixer. In uniform. A mixer? A company singles party. The men are elites at a big trading company. Are you coming? Aya's coming too. Yeah, I'll come. I'm staying with you tonight. I'm going to get drunk! I hope we find nice guys in the next three days. Okay, anyway, let's enjoy! Cheers! Come on. Hold on tight. Hey! Get your palm read! It's your lucky day! I'm very accurate! Really spot on! Please! It won't take long. Hey! I hate fortune telling. If it was just a fortune telling, it wouldn't come true. Just kidding. Welcome home. How was traveling? Did you have lots of sex abroad? You got fucked by a big black guy, didn't you? Jeez. Now, look. Let's check you out. Just like before. You don't have to get up. That's right. There's plenty of time. Take off your bra. Show me your pretty breasts. Slowly... ...massage them. Moan if it feels good. OK? Look at your panties. There...look how wet you are already. You're dripping, aren't you? Put your finger in. Touch yourself inside. I like your moans. Spread your legs. I'm gonna put it in. That's right... It's so good. Thrust your hips more. More! More! M-- Hey, wake up. Wake up! Wakey, wakey! You wanna go to the mixer, right:? Oh, yeah... Are you okay? That's not the toilet! It's coming into focus now. You're seventeen. Young leaves that is no longer a virgin. You were longing for him. - Your gentle art teacher. - Yes. Then... You gave yourself to him. No... It was an upperclassman in my club. In the clubroom after everyone left. And? And...it was really painful. It felt like a stake being driven into me. Honestly, I still wonder if it was a stake. A stake? Didn't you talk about Cézanne? What about Renoir? It hurts! The second time... ...didn't happen for a while. When I fingered myself... ...I noticed the movement. It felt so good. For a while, I gave up men... ...for my hand. You mean... ...masturbation felt better? I want you to repeat after me. OK? I like masturbating! Come on. Look at the sky. It's so vast it's almost sad. Are you embarrassed about being small-minded? Say it. I like masturbating! You're almost free. Just one last step. It'll be a full recovery. Wonderful! I wonder what youth is. Now, take it! Your happiness! Don't let it go again! No! My youth! Hello? No answer? Oh, where you going to? Not "you." It's "she." Let's take off without her. - Let's go. - Yeah! How do you like these? These? It might be a bit much. - I think they'd suit you. - Really? Hey, girl! It's your Pilot Prince. Hm? Did you fall asleep? Misako. I'm gonna open the door. Wrong girl. No! I knew this was a bad idea. You idiot! Misako. Forget it. Won't you? Let me go! Misako! Pilots and flight attendants... ...we're all in this together. So, please. Forget about this. We trust and love-- Hey... Hey. Go home. I'm never flying with you again. Misako. I'm sorry. I'm a bad man. Just get out! - I'm going! - If you don't... ...I'll cut off your cockpit! My coat. Here's your damn suit! Welcome. Excuse me. - I'll take that one. - Yes. I can only sell you this medicine if you have a doctor's prescription. No... The one next to that. The digestion aid? Yes. Let's eat! I'll have this, this, and that. This one, too. Thank you. Bullseye! I was right! I predicted that you'd appear here around this time. Cheers! Well, what happens next? I'm glad you asked. Sit down. You're cold! Let's see. I see...the sky is opening up. It relates to your job. Well? Am I right? Is it a blue sky? Yes. You got one right and one wrong. It's my job, but my blue skies are gray now. A storm's on its way. - There's nothing good. - Seems so. Seems so... There's one good thing. And it's really good. Romance. A fateful meeting. In the state of Miami. The city of Florida. - I think. - Dummy. Florida is the state. Oh, really? Anyway, it'll be a rainy night in Miami. Romantic, right? You're winding down from a day on the beach. Standing by the window. Through the palm trees, comes a tropical rhythm. A tall man appears. He wears a white tie. A red rose is in his hand. A masculine, handsome man. Thanks. Fantastic! Wonderful! You've given me hope to carry on! How about some hot sake, too? Let's go! Come on. I see. Your job is tough. Oh, not at all. Everyone looks out for each other. Yesterday was my first flight. You must've been nervous. Yes, terribly. But I'm not nervous now. Let's keep it that way. - Oh, I shouldn't.. - Please, I insist. Anyway, that's a hell of a uniform. You charmer. But it must be hard at times. Yes! Um, this one time... We can't use the toilet often, even though it's right there. She got a bladder infection. How embarrassing. I see. You have to suffer in silence. Terrible! There should be job equality in such a glamourous world. You're the ones with glamourous jobs. No, we're just ordinary salesmen. But you travel the world! We were in London last month. Oh, how wonderful! London's great. I love it too. There's that Trevi Fountain. Well, we travel all over the world, so you might say... ...we're international traders. Then we're air servant. Please excuse me a moment. Jeez, Miki... Why am I this wet? Hey, stop it! I'll yell. Go ahead. Scream. Is anyone there? Please help me! Help! Please stop! Somebody's coming. Help! Stop it! No... You went in! You went in! What'd you expect? Of course I did. Can I ask you something? Whatever you want. What's your annual salary? No less than six million yen. Six million... Do you plan to live with your parents after you marry? I'm the second born, so no. I... I want to... I want to marry you. I'm gonna come! - Come! - I'm coming! You look good in uniform. And your skin is so beautiful. Hey. Come on. I feel it! Yeah. Yes. Please. Please more. More! - Is it good? - More! Fuck me hard! Come on! Take me! Well? Am I harder than a foreigner? Yes, more! God, yeah! Nothing beats this instant udon after drinking. Picky eaters don't like other brands. Yeah. Want coffee? I like to mix Maxim, Nescafe and UCC. It's great. You won't go back to coffee shops. You're a picky eater. I guess. That's what you call gourmet. Do you ever have a recurring dream? - I get shot by yakuza. - That's dark. Surprised, huh? Flying. - Sometimes. - The experience. If I'm flying, the Yakuza are shooting. You know, you're sexy when you're eating. No one's ever told me that before. Really? Make some coffee. I'll mix the Maxim, Nescafe and UCC. - Creamer, too! - Yep! No. I said no. Ah, of course! We can't! No good! No good! Well... I'll change first. Let's see...first. 0.5 grams of UCC... One gram of Maxim... And one gram of Nescafe. And there we have our coffee. Hey. Hello? I don't believe you! Bang! This is my famous coffee from last night. Please enjoy. P.S. I'm worried. I can't remember. Nothing weird happened, right? From, Noto. Yo. Misako. I'm sorry for yesterday. I was tired. I never would've done that. I've been so into work lately. I want to fly all the time. From moment we land... I want to take off again. Even so... If you hadn't stopped me... - I would've... - Stop. I know a good doctor. Misako. Misako. We always end up like this. Pull! Go! Pull! Go! Pull! Pull! You're good. That's scary! It's so loud! Now, aim carefully. Are you ready? Go! Let's head back. You have work tomorrow. Shut up! I'm shooting until I hit one! What's wrong with you? This is the last one. I did it! You hit it! Let's go eat. Guess who! No! - Later. - Let's do it now. What are you doing? Wait! Don't go! Step on me! Won't that hurt? Please do it! Stop it, you weird perv! Don't be like that, baby! Step on me! Stop it! Marry me... Not yet? Not yet? Come! Quick! Pull! Pull! You can't hit it if you don't concentrate. Why don't you focus on something else? Even without concentration... ...I won't miss at this distance. Pull! Excuse me. I'm calling about the flight tomorrow. Yes. Could I be switched to the Miami crew? Miami. Oh, I see. So, you can't do it? I understand. Okay, okay. Yes? Let's do it again tonight, baby. Do what? You know what, baby. Who is this? It's me! Oh, jeez, is this Toshi? Take out your tits. Take off your panties. Okay! In return, you take off your pants. Okay! Well, Toshi. It's okay. Talk dirty to me. Then I'll be really horny when I see you later. I feel it. Toshi. Are you hard? Yeah. I'm big and hard. Toshi, you're too big! You're gonna rip me open. Oh, Toshi. Go deeper. Deeper... Oh, God. I'm gonna come. No! Don't come yet. I'm moving you. I can't! I'm coming! I'm-- Me too. Say you're gonna kill me. I'm gonna kill you. Kill me! Kill me! Hey! What are you doing? What are you doing?! No! You're very pretty. Don't embarrass me! Oh no. You need a bit more. Because you're so pretty. Oh, you! - Oh, um... - Who's that? I hate you! You're wrong! Hey! Let me explain! - Wait! - Wait! Come back! - Stop it. - Let me go! Don't go! Come back! Let go! Let me go! Stop it! Stop it! - It hurts! - Let's go! I can't! I want off! I can't take anymore! Misako! - Did you sleep well? - Of course! What's wrong? You look sad. It's nothing. I know! Let's have a drink. I know a good place. I have to deliver this first, though. Wait here a minute. Hi. Here's your present. Well, look at that. How are you? Catch! What the hell? Hey! Cut it out! Give it back! Oh, shemale! Give it back to me. - What's going on?! - Give it back! Leave her alone. What are you? How could you... This is bad. This is just meat. It can't be... Inside. There's something inside! You see? It's steak from New Zealand. Give it back! The drugs are hidden in here! - What? - Drugs? My meat! Wait a second! Quiet! Sir, this is it! That was expensive! Unbelieveable! I know it's in here. In here. It has to be. Come out! Come out! Come out! Shit! This is... Damn it! It's meat. You idiot! I'm sorry! I'm so sorry! We're out of a job. What was that about flight attendants smuggling drugs?! You idiot! You made me dress up like this! Chief! Wait a minute. - What about us? - I'm sorry. I'll replace it. I'm sorry. Mr. Noto? It's you. You're an undercover cop. I'm sorry. You were my charge. Then... ...that woman was suspicious. Goodbye. Wait! Please... I'm always screwing up. Romance. A fateful meeting. On a rainy night in Miami. - What? - Look. MIAMI A tall man appears. Wearing a white tie. Holding a red rose. No way! Right? So good. He's a pretty rare catch. He's tall, under 30... He has a company... ...and his own condo. It's pretty rare for second born sons. Those pedigree guys got nothing upstairs. Jetlag? No. It's hard to sleep with a man and getting some sleep at the same time. - Sorry I'm late. - Good morning. Sorry. Hey, how about this for the next mixer? Grand Henaclesh. - Looks nice. - Right? I checked all these. Oooooooh! - What happened? A special kiss. - Do we know him? She won't say! Very suspicious! Good morning. - Good morning. - Good morning. - Did you enjoy your time off? - Of course. It was great! We have to hurry or we'll be late. Yes! Hurry! Ladies and gentlemen, we are pleased to have you on board. We will take you to your destination. Your captain today is Michio Takayama. I am your assistant purser, Misako Yumeno. Ladies and gentlemen, the seat belt light is now turned off. Please relax and enjoy your flight. THE END
