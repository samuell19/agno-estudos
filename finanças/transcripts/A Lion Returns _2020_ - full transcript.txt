[instrumental music] [female vocals] What do you want? I wanna see Mum. Hey, Ahmed. Omar. How's your Mum? She's coping. Can you guys leave us alone for a minute? Sure. You want to see Mum? Yeah. I don't want to cause any trouble. I just want to see her. You know Dad's here? When did you get back? How'd you get back in the country? I got your text two days ago and then nothing. Now you're outside the house. He'd kill me if he knew I was here. Don't tell him. He's lost all respect in the community, Jamal. At the Mosque they talk about you. He pretends he doesn't hear 'em, but when he does, he says he has nothing to do with you. You know, people think the apple doesn't fall far from the tree. Well they should be ashamed of themselves for doing nothing while our brothers and sisters are getting slaughtered in our lands! And you've stopped the slaughter have you? Is that why you're back? Crusade's done? [Jamal] You don't know nothing. I know you fucked this family up. I'm repulsed by what you've done, but you're my brother and... As far as Dad's concerned, you don't exist. And where are my shoes? What shoes? My shoes you took with you. I ditched 'em overseas. Why? I saw the video. What are you talking about? You in Syria. Did you get blood on them? You proud of yourself, what you did? OK, you're not saying anything so I'm gonna go. Wait! Just tell me how she's doing. It's a little late now, isn't it? Stop being a fuckwit. Just tell me how she is. She's going into palliative care on Monday. What does that mean? It means a week, ten days. You've put us through hell. I'm not here to fight with you. I just want to see her and go. You picked the worst time for it. - She's my Mum, Omar! - Our Mum, our Mum, Jamal. You know what I mean. Just do this one favour for me, please. What makes you think I owe you anything? I'm your brother. Oh, is that it? No, the brother I had was smart enough to know right from wrong. I know what's right from wrong, that's why I went over there. It's right to butcher the innocent, is it? It's right to uphold the word of the Prophet. Oh, I'm so sick of all you fundamentalists manipulating the words of our Prophet as justification for killing innocent people. Well I'm sick of you hypocrites doing nothing for our cause! Jihad is a duty. Clearly you're not going to see any reason here. And I'm glad, 'cause anger is necessary to win this. Win what? Do you even know what you're talking about? More than you'll ever know. What was it that did it, huh? What was it? What did they say to you that made you leave your family, friends, life? You've been brainwashed. You want to talk about brainwashing? Let's start with brainwashing that happens every day in the Western world via the news media, corporate sponsored news media that you've been fucking fooled by! Jamal, everybody's inside, and pretty soon they're going to wonder where I am. So if there's nothing else... I'm not leaving until I see her. I told you, it's impossible. You'll just make things worse. It's Eid al-Adha. You don't come back on a day like this just because it suits you. Another time maybe. It has to be now. You said she's only got about a week. Just one last time and I'll go. That's your solution? Come back here after what you put us through, make us look you in the eye, and then take off? I told you I did what was right. I did this was for you, for Mum, for Dad, and all the Muslims in the world! All the Muslims in the world, really? You're speaking for all the Muslims in the world now? You're delusional. And then you put Mum through hell. You put all of us through hell. I had the Feds come to my work Jamal, to my fucking uni! I'm a lecturer in Middle Eastern political science. Do you know how bad that looked? I've strived for fifteen years to educate myself, to elevate myself, to achieve something worthy and significant. And the moment I get there, you do this shit. How do you think it looks to the... How do you think it appears to the Dean, when an Arab professor gets questioned about his brothers radical extremism? How does it look to my peers, to my students? All you care about is your reputation, Omar. They're killing Muslims over there! Look what happened in Myanmar, thousands of Muslims slaughtered We've been persecuted for too long. And the time has come when we stand up and show the world that we're not gonna sit back and take it! Do you hear yourself right now? You sound like an IS propaganda video. You're the one killing other Arabs. You're the one killing your brothers and sisters. They're not true believers. They're all Kafir. Say's who? Why do you keep believing all these people? All this mindless ideology and rhetoric, it doesn't make you right. And just because you use big words, and have a degree or ten degrees, it doesn't make you right! You have now clue what's going on over there, Omar. All you have are certificates. And you know what? Bottom line is, you're ashamed. Ashamed? What am I ashamed of? Being Muslim. Be careful what you say. [Jamal] No, it's worse than shame. Deep down inside you denounce Islam, and you're a fucking Kafir! What the fuck are you doing, huh? You'd shoot your own brother? For what? For who? What's happened to you? Look after yourself. Omar. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Please, I wanna go in. OK, then go. Go inside. I'm sure everyone would love to see you. Like you haven't done enough damage already? And why are you carrying that around? Just... Can you get me in? Not after you snap like that. You gotta be fucking kidding me. I said I'm sorry. And besides, why do you want to see us now anyhow? Eighteen months ago you called us infidels. You have a wife and son. What about them? Heidi's stopped covering up. Khalil goes to kindergarten and tells his friends his dad's in the Lebanese army. Other kids parents won't invite him to birthdays or anything. They get... we get looks everywhere we go. So people look! So what? That's our family. You're that boy's father. I don't wanna get into this right now. It's my family, OK? I'm here for one thing, and that's to see Mum and... What? Dad? You think Dad wants you here? And if Mum was so important to you, you should've thought about that before you took off. You're the one that's probably killed her. What? That's not true. All the stress, sleepless nights, she can't eat, she can't move. If I can see her, I'll make it better. It's too late. Just ten minutes max, and I'll go. Hm. Omar, please! Not while Dad's here. Talk to him. He listens to you, he always has. In his eyes, you're the good son, the smart one, never did anything wrong. He respects you. Respect is something you earn, Jamal. And you earned it. Always playing by the rules, being part of the system. No Jamal, by treating people with some decency. - You know what that is? - Oh, here we go. Stop trying to tell me how to live my life. You're always trying to prove that you're better than me. You've always escalated everything into some personal attack or agenda against you. Because it is. Dad never thought I would amount to anything. Well now look at me now. I'm doing something worthwhile, righteous, with a purpose, and he should be proud. [Omar] That you've become a terrorist? No! I'm not a fucking terrorist, OK? Stop believing that bullshit. This is more than just Dad. This goes way back. You remember what happened after September 11, what they used to call us at school, at soccer? "Terrorists, Muslim pigs, sand nigger, towel heads..." Kids call each other names all the time. Yeah, but we just sat back and copped it. It's no reason to hate the world. You tolerate it. And that's your problem, Omar. You tolerate too much. That's the difference between you and me. I won't tolerate it anymore. Let me get this straight. You're holding on to some pent up rage from being called names in the playground? You're still not getting it. It's not about me! It's about something bigger than that. It's about the demonising, the racism, and the oppression behind the name calling. Violence is not the way to defend your beliefs, Jamal. There are peaceful ways! Really? You're up against corporate fucking espionage, years of global media strategy aimed at demonising Arabs! That's not the point. You're choosing to fight violence with violence. There's no other way to win. If you come with me to the meetings you'd know first hand what's really going on over there. It's not something you can read about. We need our own land, our own Islamic territory. They weren't meetings. They were brainwashing sessions. You don't know anything about it. The same people that got in your ear and had you get on a plane, are the same people having Sunday barbecues and enjoying the free Australian sun while you pull the trigger. At least that's something I could do. What? Fight, I could fight. You're unbelievable. And my shoes, where are they? I already told you. I got rid of them. I wore 'em out. Who's side were you on? The right side. You know, one night I was checking out clips from Syria, and what all you puppets were doing over there, and I see footage of a group of radicals proclaiming the work of Allah, whilst simultaneously shooting a line of young Arab men in the back of the head. And that's when I see them. The shoes. The ones I bought you for your birthday. In the background, standing there, holding a black flag, proud... Suddenly it's all real. I've seen first hand what you've turned into. I knew it was you. Your face was covered, but I can tell by the way you move and hold yourself, your body and the shoes. You still don't get it, do you? [Omar] Get what? Everything you live for, everything you teach is for the privileged. Your people are suffering across the world, being attacked and squashed. Afghanistan has been bombed to the shithouse. Six million Syrian refugees, a million dead Iraqis. Libya and Yemen are a mess! And you, and your students, and all those big mouth Arabs, sit around and talk about it as if you have the solution. But what the fuck are you actually doing? Nothing! You're all white washed Arabs! So yeah, I took those shoes, and I put them to good use. The world doesn't see it now, but in time they will see that our actions are the true will of Allah. Look around you! The world's going to hell. There's a war coming, and it's us versus them. [Omar] Who's them? You're the one that's made them into refugees. You're the one destabilising the Middle East so America and it's allies are the strongest - in the region. - Bullshit! Come on Jamal, wake up! You're being lured by a mythical fantasy of a Caliphate. Can't you see that? You're doing the dirty work for the West. Can't you see that? You're the one killing your brothers and sisters, Arabs, Muslims, children, farmers, for them! They're not believers. They don't want to follow Sharia law and the way of the Prophet. Can't you see your actions are contradicting your very words? Can't you see that? Amazing. You've always been a follower. Always getting into trouble, mixing with the wrong crowd. Teachers used to tell me, "your brother's a troublemaker your brother's a menace." But I know the real Jamal, the kid I used to walk home from school, you remember? My friends and I always used to walk ahead of you because we were older and cooler, and I didn't want them to think I had to look after you. But there was this one time you got into a fight with a bunch of boys, you remember? Yeah I remember, I was outnumbered. I saw them knock you down and kick the shit out of you. And I know you saw me just stand back and watch. Then when we got home, Mum belted you because your uniform was dirty. And you lied and told her you fell in a ditch or something. Why didn't you tell her the truth? I can't remember. You sure? Kids only lie if they're to blame, and it wasn't your fault. Why did you lie? Maybe if I told her the truth, you'd cop it for not sticking up for me. That's right. How times have changed. She's afraid of you. [Jamal] What? Mum is afraid of you. [phone vibrates] Why don't you answer it? What do you mean she's afraid of me? I'd never hurt her. She's afraid of who you've become. If I can talk to her, I'll explain, she'll understand. Understand that you've beheaded innocent people? [Jamal] No! I didn't behead anyone, OK? I can tell you that much. You don't know what happened over there, Omar. [Omar] Then tell me. Not until I see her first. She's spent her whole life protecting you. No matter what you did, she still loved you. Yeah, but Dad never did. Uncle Yahya cared more about me more than he did. What did you expect? You were always getting into trouble. Mum had to call Uncle Yahya to protect you from Dad. If Dad knew half the shit you got up to, you'd be dead. Maybe you'd be better off if I was. [Omar] What's that supposed to mean? Huh? Uncle Yahya was the only one that cared about me. [Omar] Because you kept getting in trouble. No, Omar. It's 'cause I fucking tried to end it. [Omar] What? I didn't want to be here anymore. [Omar] What are you talking about? I was sixteen. I wasn't in a good place. I was fucked, unhappy. I called Uncle Yahya and he called me... he talked me out of it. Uncle Yahya... That's when you started going to the Mosque. Why didn't you call me? 'Cause you were at uni man, and we weren't even talking. I'm still your brother. Or you could've gone to Mum. Nah, that would've killed her. And you don't think what you're doing now is? She'll understand. What could you possibly say to her to make her understand? [loud thump] Woah, woah, relax! Jamal, you're not telling me something. What's going on? How did you get back in? You either said you were there for humanitarian aid or you're a fighter. And if you're a fighter, you must have used someone else's passport. Was it someone that you killed? Was it someone that you killed, Jamal? Omar, stop! Look, will he freak or will just ignore me? Dad? He'll freak. Why can't he just give me a moment? I just wanna see Mum. Omar, please! Do this for me. Please, just this one last time, I'm your brother, this is important. [phone rings] Yeah? I'm just dealing with some work stuff. Start eating. I'll be there soon. Not long. OK. Jamal, if you want me to help, I need to know what happened. Jamal? Did you find what you were looking for? Did you achieve what you wanted? What about your life here? What life? Work for some rich white cunt, get married, have a kid. Well, I did that. Nothing changed. It came back. I wanted it to finish, to end. But this time God gave me a purpose, a mission. So what? You're going to go back? It's complicated. Jamal, you're my brother, and I still care for you. But I can't listen to anymore of this. I... I have to go. [Jamal] Don't go. Omar please, I'm begging you. I'm desperate. I've done some things. I've seen some shit. I need to see Mum one last time, please! First tell me what happened. Why? Why do you wanna know? Because I'm your fucking brother. Oh man... At first it was unreal. It was exciting, the guns, the training, the mountains. We marched from village to village taking over each one like Crusaders, like Muhammad's army. No one stopping us, no one bombing us from above. Alhamdullah. Spare me the triumphs Jamal, please. I've heard and read the conquests. Well, you asked me. We were in Northern Syria. We took over a little village called Abu Qilqil, near Manbij. We'd separate the men and women. We'd make the men convert. And if they didn't, they'd be tortured. Or they'd be shot and thrown into ditches. And the women, especially the young ones... How young? Fifteen, sixteen. See you gotta understand, Omar, a lot of these guys were just out of prison, from Saudi Arabia, you know? The Saudi's released thousands of the worst of the worst criminals into Syria. Thieves, murderers, rapists, killers, and these guys haven't been around women in years. And there was Bosnians, and Chechens, Moroccans, Algerians, from Yemen, all mixed in. We're all just young guys out to create our own state, our own promised land and our own Caliphate, and cleanse it from all the disbelievers and the corrupt dictators that don't believe in the true prophet Muhammad. What did you do with the women and girls? Most were converted, kept for duties. Some were sold to warlords, and the others were kept for pleasure. Pleasure? Yes, slaves. That's when I saw this young girl. She wouldn't be more than fifteen. Fifteen? Yeah. They shot her father and her brothers, and they sold her Mum to another crew. And why'd they sell her mother? So she wouldn't see what her daughter would go through. She was kept in a room 24/7. Guys would go in every hour and do whatever it is they wanted. [Omar] And you? No. I didn't. I said I didn't. What stopped you? Why not just be one of the boys? 'Cause she was fifteen man, just crying, just fucking crying, bro. I didn't wanna... I went there to fight, not to... I entered the room. She was lying on the bed face down, feet barely touching the ground, crying. I walked up to her, and she looked up at me, and she just begged me, "Please, please, no more." She looks up at me with these big brown eyes... This young girl... She pleaded with me, and I didn't even consider doing anything. That's when I saw the blood, between the sheets, on the sheets, between her legs. I thought to myself, what kind of human being could do this to such a young child, just a young girl born in the wrong place, the wrong time, the wrong war? I gave her my water, and I told her to put her clothes on and I was going to get her out of there. [Omar] Did you? Yeah, that night. And that's when it all got too much for me. The bombs started, and we had to move further up north towards Turkey. [Omar] Is that when you got out? Yeah, that, and when I found out about Mum. [Omar] How'd you find out? Don't worry, I found out. [Omar] What now? [whispers] What do you mean? You're gonna have to turn yourself in, Jamal. For everybody's sake. Can you get me in? Let me go inside and see what's going on. They've probably all started eating. Are you going to talk to Dad? I can't promise anything. I'll try. I'll try, cause I know Mum would probably want to see you. Thanks, Omar. Stay in the car. I'll come back and let you know. [Ahmed] Jamal, you OK? [soft instrumental music] [Islamic call to prayer plays] Jamal's here. He's outside. Down the road in a car. I don't understand. How? He wouldn't tell me. Look, I don't have all the details, and I don't have much time. But I need you to do something for me. I need you to get everyone out of Mum's room and help me keep Dad in the backyard. - Omar... - Listen, we can't... We have to make sure Dad doesn't see him. Can you do that? Omar, maybe we should call the police. Leave that to me. Look, he just wants to see Mum first, OK? How can you trust anything that he says? And all the kids are here. He's my brother. And your brother's a terrorist. If he spent one day fighting over there, that makes him a killer. Tell him to go, please. He's already done enough damage. I know you're worried. Look at me, I know you're worried. But he's not going to cause any trouble, OK? Now please, will you help me get them outside? Should I tell Heidi? No one needs to know. I don't want him near the kids. [call to prayer continues] [indistinct conversation] OK, Dad's in the back with all the other men. OK. Maya's gonna get all the women out of Mum's room. So we don't have much time. Once they're all gone you can go in and see her. Is Heidi here? [Omar] Yes. And Khalil. OK. OK. Just wait over there. Make sure no one sees you. [speaks Arabic] Now what? I want to have a word with Mum. Just make sure no one comes in to the room, especially Dad. Why are you helping him? If you don't call the police, you're risking yourself by aiding him. It's my fault. I saw the signs, I should've done something. Now you can. Call the police. Let him see Mum first, and then I'll talk to him about that after, OK? - Where's Heidi? - She's in the room. We should tell her. She has a right to know. Not yet. I hope you know what you're doing. [Woman] Kids! Come inside the house! What's going on, Omar? Nothing, I just want a private moment with her. Let me know if you need anything, OK? I will. Thank you. Just give me a sec, sorry mate. Why are the women coming out? Did something happen to Mum? She's fine. She's fine. Uncle Yahya, I need you to do me a favour. I need you to go down, hold Dad and keep him out here. Don't want him in the house. Just want you to keep him out here. - Can you do that? - Why? Just keep him out here. Jamal's here. Where? [Omar] Out the front. It's OK, he's not going to cause any trouble. - I'll go to him. - No, no, no, listen. I just need you to stay here with Dad. He just wants to see Mum. Then what's he going to do? Not sure, he's gonna have to turn himself in. Not here? At the moment, first thing, I just need to get him in and out of the house, alright? OK. Let me know if you need me to talk to him? [Omar] OK I will. Thanks, Uncle. Scared the shit out of me, man. She wants to see you. Jamal, she's very sick. Please be careful with what you say and be gentle. Of course. Most of the women are in the backyard. Auntie Fadia and a couple of the others are in the living room. And Dad? He's in the back also. Uncle Yahya's keeping an eye on him. Uncle Yahya? [Omar] Yeah, I told him. What's wrong? What did he say? He said he wanted to see you, but I told him to keep an eye on Dad. Why did you tell him? [Omar] I told you, I needed someone to keep an eye on Dad. Fuck. It's OK. He won't say anything. - Where's Heidi? - Inside. You want me to tell her? Khalil saw me. Did he recognise you? OK look, just let me do a final check, just give me another five minutes, alright? What are you doing here? Just take it easy. Khalil mentioned you were here. I thought he was joking. I can't be seen, so please come here. Let me talk to you, please. You don't have to be scared. How did you even get here? You're on a watch list. - Let me explain. - What did you... Please. Come here. No, please don't. What are you doing here? I'm here to see my mother. And you don't even tell me you're here? How long have you been back? You look beautiful. I don't know what's happening, Jamal. I don't know what to say. What have you done? It's not important. Don't tell me it's not important. I'm your wife, and you just left us. No word, nothing. What have you done? I'll tell you everything, but now's not the time. It is the time! You can't just do and say whatever you please and expect me to passively agree. Tell me that you didn't kill anyone! Jamal? Look, I don't want to talk about it right now. And you're still my wife. Heidi, stop... - Answer my question. - It's not the time. Did you? Habibi, it's really complicated. I thought about you and Khalil every day. Did you? And what about all the sons of the mothers that were being killed? It's not that simple, everyone dies in conflict. Do you know... - No! No! - Shh. Shh. No! Get off me! Do you know how hard this has been on me? Do you realise how hard this has been on me? Do you realise that? Do you realise how hard this has been on me? And on Khalil? Raising a child on one's own, do you know how hard that is? Do you know? Or did you just, did you just not care? Did you just not think what I would go through? I'm sorry, Heidi. Oh, you're sorry? Now? What did you think was going to happen, huh? What did you think was going to happen, how did you see this ending? I mean Jamal, what answers were you looking for? Can't you see? Don't you see what you've done? Don't you know your dad will kill you if he sees you? - He won't! - And my parents, they want nothing to do with your family! Jamal, tell me how this is going to work. Do you know that they're watching me as well? They come over, and they ask me questions. Me! They say, "Where is he?" "Have you made contact?" "Are you sending him money?" They'll find you. I mean, what am I supposed to say or do? I can't hate you. Because I've tried that. And I can't love you, because that's wrong. I never did any of this to hurt you. I don't know if you believe this, but I still love you. No, if you loved me, you wouldn't have left. But you were gone before then, weren't you? It wasn't about you, it was about me. - I was going through something. - I know, I know. You shut down, you withdrew, Jamal. I found the tablets. We should've talked about it. I would've understood. Well, in time you'll understand that I was following God's will. Do you really believe that? It's his will, don't question it. But don't you question it? Didn't you question leaving me behind? No matter what, I'm still your husband. Abandoning me does not make you a husband. I converted for you. But I cannot pray to the same God that you do, Jamal, I can't. I can't do that. Don't say that! It's wrong. How dare you. Can't you see what you're doing is wrong? You don't understand. Well then explain it to me! Explain it to me, explain it to your father. Explain it to your son! I will, but not right now. Why did you stop wearing your scarf? Why? Why do you think? I cannot keep defending this religion Jamal, I can't. After what happened in London, I can't keep defending it. I have to see my Mum. What about us? You say we don't understand, Jamal, but you've damaged this family, and your actions, they have consequences. I just need to see her. And then? No matter what, I'm still your husband. I could hate you easier if you weren't. But that's thing, you see. I keep remembering all the good in you, Jamal. I remember why we fell in love. And I remember how loving you were with Khalil. But I don't know now, I don't know. I'm sorry, Heidi. OK, look. I did what I had to do. What does that mean? It means I took a stand. And I fought for something right, for a cause. Your cause has done more harm than good. Only God can judge me on that. Why don't I believe you? If I ask you to forgive me... Habibi, come here. I thought I told you to wait inside. I'm your father, Khalil. Say hello to your father. Hello. I love you, my son, I missed you, my little lion. Did you miss your father? Yeah. Come here. He's just confused, Jamal, we all are. I know. In time, you'll forgive me. For leaving us, or for what you've done? For everything. You should go inside. Why don't you go inside. Before people start looking. I'll talk to you later. It's OK. Go. It's alright. Come with me. No. Just Heidi, my boy, and Omar. I heard you were coming back. Allah is proud of you. Thanks, khalo. But what are you doing back here? I got a message from Abu Al Hamid, the day you left Syria. I was told that you were to be kept isolated until we were ready. You shouldn't be here. It's going to be alright. You can't abandon this, Jamal. A lot of people are relying on you. I have to see my mother. The longer you stay here, the more risky it becomes. Jamal. Do you get that? - Yes, I do. - Really? Jamal, there's a lot at stake. I know, I just need some time to see her, please? Does she know you're here? Omar told her. She wants to see me. This is crazy, it's too risky. Listen, you need to have strength and a strong resolve. You remember the darkness that surrounded you? You almost succumbed to it. You reached out to me and Allah showed you what your purpose is. And now you're a warrior. Doubt is weakness, and weakness will destroy you. Us. - I'm not weak. I just... - What? I want to make sure I'm doing this for the right reasons. You are doing it for the right reasons. This is why you are here, this is what your purpose is, for that great honour. Yes, I know. I just want to make sure it's the right thing. Do you realise what the implications of this are? Abu Al Hamid is a very powerful man. He finds out that you're here, and that you're having doubts, you put your whole family at risk. A... A betrayal like this is punishable. So Jamal, you need to get out of here. You need get back to where they're keeping you. Seeing my Mum is important, she doesn't have much time. We know that, but you're on a path. Something's not right about it. I thought we were a religion of peace? That's the Shetan inside you talking. No, it's me. This is me talking! Your fear is human. Your will is of God. And that's brave. You saw firsthand what was happening over there. It takes people like us to make sure that the message continues. There's still time to fix this, Jamal. Just, just go now. I know you'll make this right. - Come on. Let's go. - [Omar] Yahya. He's alright. Um, look, he needs to get away from here. I can take him. He wants to see Mum. If you don't want your father to find out that he's here, he must leave now. It's OK, just make sure he stays in the back. I don't think that's a great idea. I think it's best he comes with me now, and I'll bring him back when everyone's left. Not a bad idea, Jamal. I'm not leaving until I see my Mother. Uncle Yahya look, he'll go in and see her, he'll be about ten minutes. So just go keep an eye on Dad for me. Alright. I'll find you later, yeah? Just don't be long. OK, we don't have much time. What? What? Uncle Yahya. What about him? He won't tell Dad. OK? Let's go, come on. [chatter and children playing] [female vocals] - Just wait over here. - OK. [speaking Arabic] Come on, let's go. Jamal. Jamal! Come on, let's go. Let me go in by myself, please. OK. [female vocals swell] Just go inside. Just go inside, I'll talk to him. [traditional music] [crying] [pensive music] People are getting suspicious, Omar. Heidi wants to see him. She did. Dad did too. What? How? Jamal was waiting outside Mum's door about to go in. Dad came in and saw him. I have to talk to him. It's not a good idea. There are way too many people out here, babe. Omar, I know he's your brother, OK? I get that. But you can't protect him anymore. Maya please, out of everyone right now, I need you on my side, OK? Please. I am on your side! I am! You're just not thinking logically. I know you better than that. Hey, I'll talk to Heidi, I'll tell her to give him a minute... Thanks, thanks. And you, you and her just stay near the door, - make sure no one comes. - Yeah. Leave it to me. Hey Omar, what's going on? What are all the women doing out here? My Dad and the others are asking? It's alright. Mum's not feeling too well, bro. It's OK. Just let them know it's all good. - OK, I'll let them know. - Alright [coughing] [sorrowful music] Hey. Can I get you anything? I just need to talk to him. I need to find out what he wants to do. What about what you want to do? Everyone's labelled him a terrorist. I just see the father of my child. Of course he is. And that's OK. But he's here and we can't change it. I know. We just have to let him talk to Mum, and we'll figure out what we do next. OK? I know, I just, I need to do the right thing by Khalil, he's confused. Heidi, it's a difficult situation to be in, no one expected him to come back, or be here. Well then even if he has changed, how could I forgive him, or even trust him? You don't have to figure it out now. We'll let him see Mum, you two work it out later. He's not well. I mean, I found his antidepressants. He needs help but he's not going to ask for it, because he's, he's got too much pride. They're both stubborn. You know that. One thing I know about Omar, is his family is the most important thing in the world. We just have to let Jamal... Hey, is everything OK? I'm worried about Dad. How long is he here for? Not long. Can I go in? You will. Just let him have his moment. Sure. Hang on a sec. You OK? How long you gonna be? Not long. Heidi's outside. Alright, tell her not to leave and I'll see her. OK. He'll see you again before he goes. Where? I don't know, but he will. Hey. Thanks, habibi. How is she? Yeah, she's OK. She wants to see Dad. Not now, surely? - It's for Jamal. - I think so. Here. I've gotta go. What's Jamal doing? What's he thinking? You must talk some sense into him to get him to get out of here. Uncle he's not, he's not thinking rationally. Something happened to him over there and he's not dealing with it well. It's best he leaves immediately, right after he finishes speaking with your mother. I know, I know. But he's not well. I'm concerned now. I don't, I don't understand what he's thinking. Look, you know I need your help. He, he trusts you, you've always been there for him. Of course. You're my family. I will always be there for you both. Should we call a lawyer, hand him in? Let me organise it. You just take care of your mother. Heidi's gonna probably want to go with him. That's fine. OK, and what about Dad? Has he said anything to you? No. Nothing. Mum wants to speak to him. You want me to tell him? No, let me first. No. I'll go. No, no. I know my Dad. He won't be swayed. I just want to get a sense of what he's thinking. Alright. Alright. Listen, I think you should go inside and get your brother ready to come out with me. And I'll see what I can do with your father. Alright, please, just reason with him. Make him understand! Even if we get them together for a few minutes. This situation is not looking good for any of us, Omar. The longer he stays, the more furious and unpredictable your father is. OK. Good boy. You're a good boy. How you doing? Yeah, alright. Did you talk to him? Yeah. [phone vibrates] [traditional music] Ready? Yeah. Let me quickly check what's happening. Omar! Talk to him again, please? I'll try. [mournful music] Do you want me to do it? Can I talk to you for a minute? Come on. Where's Omar? He's out back, talking to your father. Jamal, you're best not to be seen. So you know nothing about his return? I told you, no. Why are you asking? Because he confides in you. You have no idea why Jamal went over? Omar, why are you asking me all this? Clear your head of this nonsense, OK? We're wasting time. Listen. Go, speak to your brother and get him out of here. Do you understand? - You did it. - Do you understand? Omar! Your brother loves you, we all love you. But the longer you stay here, the more you put us all at risk. [traditional music] - Let me talk to him. - No, no! Please Jamal, stay here. OK? We don't want this situation escalating, we've been through enough. Just wait inside until Omar comes back. He wanted to come out. He thinks you're going to turn him in. What's he doing? No good, man. He wants you out of here now. Such a fucking stubborn cunt. - Fuck it. I'll go! - No, Jamal! Listen! - No, no, Jamal, please! - No Jamal, baby, please! Please, come on, let's just leave, now, let's go. It's not worth it, OK, bro? Habibi, come on. Come on! No! No one's coming with me. Stay with Mum, stay with Mum. Stay with Heidi. Jamal, come on. Let's go. Jamal. Jamal! Come on! Jamal, let's go, let's go! - I love him, Omar. - I know you do, man. Just give him some time, we'll sort it out. Let's go. I just wanna tell him I'm sorry and to forgive me. I know man, but now is not the time, let's go. Please man, we gotta go. We have to go. Let's go. Listen, your father's going to call the police any minute! - You need to leave here now. - Let's go. Jamal, come on. Come on. Let's go. There's people waiting for you, Jamal. - I'm not going nowhere! - Fucking come on, Jamal! - I'm not going nowhere! - Listen to me! - You need to leave now! - Not until I see him. Jamal! Look I'll go through with it. I'll do it! I'll stick to my word! But not until I see him. He doesn't want to... What do you mean "stick to your word"? What's he talking about? - I don't know! - What's going on? - Go through with what? - Jamal? Something... - Jamal? Hey. - What's going on? Tell me? Are you doing something? Is he on a mission? - Go through with what? - Is he on a mission? Don't be stupid! Jamal, tell him! Hello? Hello? Police? [Yosef] Yes. My son, Jamal Alamein. He's here, yes. Please come and get him. It is the same address. Thank you. Jamal. Jamal, what are you doing? Gimme the gun. Look at me. [Omar] Jamal? Jamal. Give me... Jamal... - [Yahya] Jamal. Please. - [Omar] Jamal. Gimme the gun. - Don't do it. Don't do it. - Jamal look at me. - [Omar] Jamal give me the gun. - [Heidi] Jamal, no. - [Omar] Give me the gun! - [Yahya] Jamal, give me the gun. [Omar] Jamal, please. Don't do this. Jamal. Give me the gun! Jamal. [All] Jamal! [sorrowful music]
