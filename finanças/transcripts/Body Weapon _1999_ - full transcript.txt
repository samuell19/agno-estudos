Okay, l will tell you. Police! Police?! So what? Don't hit me... Don't hit him! Do you want us to let your man go? Let him go... Please me first! Take care of him! You are not beautiful enough! No... This is better. Come on. Let go of me... Where are you going? Help... No... The male victim was tortured to death. There are 36 places of bruises. There are broken bones all over his body, 30% of his skin is burnt. The eye vessels broke. Also there were 20 games coins stuffed into his anus. lt was not the same case with the female victim. Her body wasn't obviously hurt. There was force penetration at her sex organ. But there was no sperm found. l believe that the killer had a condom on. What is this? lt is oil paint. l believe that the killer is crazy and gay. The victim's mouth, throat were wounded and bled internally. Five teeth were knocked off. l believe that were caused by a blow of a hard object. The victim's anal had the same wounds. Rectum was wounded and bled badly. The mouth, seX organ and anal were wounded. l believe it was caused by the penetration of a hard object. lt caused the vitcim to bleed to death. Kwan, l am not giving you pressure. This case is causing lots of attentions. This is the second time in the last three months. You have to solve this case as soon as possible. Officer Ma, l understand. l am doing my best. What have you got? l have got their identity. They are lovers. But we still haven't got the killer's motive yet. We are doing our best to find more imformation about this. Come in. Good afternoon sir. Sit down. Thank you, sir. So, have the scientific Evidence Office found anything new? No! We haven't got any finger prints at the crime scene. But we found out that these coins only can be used in 2 video game places. Looks like the killer is not only brutal. And they are very professional too! We are the professionals of beating crimes too. Right? Officer Ma, don't worry! Don't you know good guys always win? l have confidence that we will solve the case soon. We will catch the criminal soon. Here come tea and coffee. Officer Ma, here is your lemon tea. This cup with 3/4 spoon of sugar is yours. Thank you Black coffee is yours. Thanks. Ling. Please knock before you come in neXt time. Officer Ma, l wanted to knock. But l was carrying all these drinks, that is why l didn't knock. You wear so little, doesn't it mean you don't have money to buy clothes? Of course not! Can you behave better? This is a police station, not a fashion show room. Yes sir. You can go out now, we still have things to discuss. Yes sir. You two are something, why do both of you have same taste? l don't know what you're thinking. Officer Ma, let's talk about the case, okay? Madam, we have two handsome men in the force. But you got them both hooked. How long are you going to continue with this? Why don't you let one of them go so other girls can have a chance? Shitmouth, shut up! By the way, what did they do? They peeked at their teachers while they were changing. You assholes, how dare you peeked at your teachers?! Let me look at your shit faces! You like to peek, why don't you peek at police women? Come on, try it. Come on... What's wrong? What's wrong? You feel shame? You know this is shame now? Damn! Useless. l am Lee. l only used one leg, l have two more legs left. Shut up! Hurry. Come on. l am not scared of you. Good! Very good! Kwan, you are great. What? This is for you! What? My whole body is weak, only one place is hard. Ling. Sir. Get back to you seat, l have things to announce. Yes sir. After the last contest, lnspector Wu Chi-kwan will represent us to join the Chinese HK Martial Arts Competition. Yeah! Yeah. Work hard! The whole force is counting on you. Officer Leung, don't worry! Starting from tomorrow, l will train hard. Monday, Wednesday and Friday are for physical training. Saturday is for technique training. l will train you personally. Any problem? No problem, sir. Okay! You will be busy next week. l will take care of Ling everyday. You wish! She is yours during daytime, and mine at night. Damn you! Let's go eat something. Kwan, if you can beat the Chinese police, l will feel happier than you. This is a little gift. Don't be mean. l am not! Although he beated me today, l can beat him some other day. l know you are good. But my memory is better than you. l remember that two days later is your birthday. l forgive you. Should l get a reward? Okay! But, how are you going to celebrate my birthday? Ah l will tell you later. We will have a BBQ party. Okay! Everybody get ready. No problem! l am hungry, let's go eat. Okay. Are you ready? l am damn hungry. Wait! Almost done. Office Lee, you are lazy. What is wrong with you? Do l have to do everything? Didn't you see me busy with the sausage? You asshole! Look at Officer Wu, he is sweating. Why don't you go help him? You know he can't do it well. lf this continues, we will end up eating instant noodles. l will fix it. Serve you right. What did you say? Officer Lee, you got a good mouth. But that is a small part to success. Officer Wu is quiet. He is a true gentleman. Look at Sean Connery. He doesn't talk, but his eyes... can capture you. l bet Officer Wu will win. Want me to break your beef balls? Asshole! Officer Wu, l am counting on you. l bet on Officer Lee. All girls like a man with honey lips. Even if it is a lie, it's better than none. Officer Wu's mouth is like it has been glued tight. He doesn't know how to talk. He is going to lose. But if he hires me as his personal tutor. l promise you he is going to win. Why don't you teach him the secret weapon? l want to win with honour! Officer Wu, what gift did you buy for Madam? Gift?! What is it? Where did Madam go? She went to change, she will be back soon. You don't want to wait? She is here. She is beautiful. Madam, you look pretty today! Move. Ling, happy birthday! Thanks! Here is another one. Open it. EXpensive watch. l saved money for two years. l am poor now. l will put it on for you. Officer Wu, what did you buy for Madam? Officer Wu, where is your gift? Come on, take it out! Ling, sorry! l forgot! Don't worry! What? Forget it! You can make it up. Office Wu, give her a birthday kiss. Officer Wu, kiss her. Kiss her... No! Don't be shy! Kiss her. Crazy! Kiss her... l didn't know your secret weapon... is to come here empty handed. You should have told me! l wouldn't have bought her a gift too. You get to kiss her. ls her face smooth? Stop acting cool! ldiot! Stop talking! Time to cut the cake! Time to cut the cake. Let's go. "Happy birthday to you..." "Happy birthday to Ling." "Happy birthday to you." Make a wish. Good. Madam, what did you wish for? Tell us! l wish to have different birthday memories every year. No way?! Your wish should be getting married soon. Stop it! have some cake. Thanks! lt's pretty. Today is your birthday, you go first. You first... Take it! You are naughty! Don't worry! l will clean it up for you. Let's get one thing straight. No matter who Ling chooses, we will always be brothers, okay? Will we still be brothers? Of course! That's great! Tell Ling to clean up for you! What is wrong with you? l don't understand what you are saying. Look. Tel me, how's look like? You dishonored the entire police force. Officer Ma, listen to me. l wanted to use some other techinque to teach the kids. They got me wrong. What about having 2 boybriends? Officer Ma, l didn't mean to. Do you know how people name you? l know! They call me playgirl. But think about it, Officer Ma. lf l want to be a player. l can have more than 2 boyfriends, right? You look like an actress more than a cop! l don't think you should be a cop anymore. You should pick one of them and get married. Officer Ma, l wanted to get married too. My mother called me last night from Canada, she wants me to get married soon. Officer Lee can make me laugh all the time. l like him a lot. Officer Wu is a genlteman. l like him too. l like them both, l don't know which one to pick. lf they can just become one, l don't have to think so much. Two in one?! Do you think they are shampoo? lf this continues, you three won't have a good ending. the whole force will be turned up-side down by you fools. Just pick one, okay! lf you don't l will fire you! Let's talk about our job. Have you found anything new in the murder case? We are chasing after the coins. And we've found out that the female victim had got sex disease, STD. So we are investigating all public and private hospital that treat STD. Okay! Get work! Yes sir. You have STD? Yes! Third floor! Thanks! "Ling : See you at the pier." Who is calling Mr. Wu? Ling, tell him to come to the pier. Tell him l am waiting for him. Ling. What's wrong? What were you doing? l was following a suspect. Do you have any new leads? l didn't have my phone with me and l was worried about you, so l came immediately. Will you do everything l tell you, will you jump into the sea? What are you doing? You asked me to jump! You are crazy! Go to hell! lt didn't work, what else can l do? Smash your head then. Oh, shit! Ling. Ling, what's wrong? l am mad! Why are you mad? Tell me. l know why. You don't know which one to choice. Today is the good day, pick one. l know! A person in love is very happy. But l can't stand this triangle relationship anymore. l don't want to play aymore. You should know, loving the same girl as my best friend is very hard. But l won't give up. l will prove that you make the right decision. l will make you happy. l will do everything for you. lf you like. Because l really love you. Look carefully. Turn. Watch out for his kick. He is the champion last year. Wait, l have to go to the bathroom. Your pager went off all night. Something happened? No! Ling is looking for me. How is your triangle relationship? l don't know what to say. Officer Leung, what do you think? You look very good at this. You can see so well in the dark? Officer Leung, one is my best friend. The other one is the girl l like. l don't know should l go after her or not. Do you have any suggestion? This is your private matter, you make your own decision. Didn't you say that she is calling you? Why don't you go to her? Yes sir. Congratulation. Thanks! Don't get mad! How come? We are good brothers! l am very happy! l have both good brother and wife at the same time. Ling, congratulation. Thanks! Officer Wu, l told you. You should have hired me as your tutor. lf you did, the groom today is you. What did you say? Take a picture... Come on, take a picture. Ready, smile! Cheers! Did you go mess around with your friends last night? No! What about after you are drunk?! l didn't drink. Kwan made himself drunk. Quiet... Come on. You stink! lt will be very quick... Wait for me. l will show you my third leg. Honey, did you shower? Smell it. l don't stink anymore. Are you tired today? Yes! Let's go to sleep. Hello... Hello. Let me see. Don't be scared. Are you comeing to look for me? Good luck to your marriage. What are you doing here? Best of luck. Honey, don't come out! Don't come any closer! Don't hit my head. Don't kick my head. You are something. Don't come any closer! lt is your turn. You kick my head again?! l told you not to come. Honey. l told you not to hit my head. Go to hell! You assholes! Your punches and kicks won't work on me! Do you want to save your husband? lf you want, then please me. No... l am not excited yet! You have to seduce me. Act like a slut! You have to make me horny! lf you get me horny, l will let you live. More. Don't cry! More. No... Yeah No... You did fine! But you are not just to please me. You have to please them. No! Kwan, how is Sam? Tell me! Come on! Kwan, tell me! How is my husband? Say it... say it! How is he? He didn't make it. No way... No way! He is still alive... Ling... Ling, don't be like this. You lie to me! No... No way. Ling. l want my husband back... Listen to me! Calm down! Give me back my husband... Calm down! You lie to me! What? Help her over there. RelaX! We gave her a shot. Let her get some rest. Ling, Officer Ma and Officer Leung come here to see you. Ling, don't worry! We already caught the suspect. When you get better, you can go point him out. lf you point him out, we will be able to catch the rest of them. l can promise you, they will be in jail for the rest of their lives. Doctor, how is the patient? With the lost of her clost one and the torture she had suffered. She will have a short period time of niggard. This time she lost her husband and with the torture she had suffered. Her behavior is very normal. She will be fine after a period of time. Thanks. l have a meeting to attend. You stay with her. lt's useless! The criminals will only get 20 to 30 years in jail. She is poor, she lost her husband. And she also got chained raped too. That is the feeling she can never get rid off. Officer Leung, what are you talking?! Am l wrong? Go out first! Officer Leung, don't say such a thing now! l was telling the truth. l know this is the truth, but don't say it in front of her. You think she will feel good? You like her? None of your business. We are men. You shouldn't marry her. She has been hurt, there is a bad memory in her mind. She can never get rid of those feeling. l don't want you to spend lots of money on hookers later. What are you talking about? l just want the best for you. You should find a wife who has a clean background. Stop it! No more words! You... Why are you so mad? Want to go get a drink? l don't want anything! Where are you going? ldiot! We discovered that you had scabbado. You must have contracted it when the rapist raped you. There will be tiny spots around your vagina, it'll burst too. So you have to take this medicine on time. You have to finish the whole process. lf you don't you might not be able to kill all the germs completely. Then you will be in big trouble. Sorry! l don't want to be bothered. Why didn't you call me? l didn't want you to come pick me up. l just want to be alone. Leave please. l... l know you all care for me. But you should know, your concern... means harm to me. l understand! l won't force you. Tomorrow you will go to the station to point out the suspect. We have arranged it. l am leaving. Can you recognize him? l can't. Ling, one of them matches your description that you gave me. How come you said that you couldn't recognize him? A scar on the face. You mentioned that the rapist had a scar on his face. l told you it's not him! Go to hell! Are you crazy? What are you doing to my boyfriend? Stop it... Asshole! Are you crazy?! What? She hit me! Ling Wong, police number 53288. Because she is suspected of over using police force. We received complaints that she abused violence towards innocent citizens. She damaged the reputation of the police force. Officer Ling is on suspension with immediate effect. And the internal affair branch will investigate into this matter. She will be suspended until futher notice. Why do you take me here? You want me to introudce a master to you, so l let you see something here. What? Follow me. Teach Q and that slut a good lesson when you see them. l pay for his living. Now he cheats behind my back. When l give you the signal then beat him up until he can't get up, got it? Got it! What are you looking at?! Bitch, you've never seen a fight before? What? Bring me here to watch people fighting for their man? You are right! The one who just yelled at you named Dora. She is notorious. But someone just stole her man. l understand! You want me to learn from the guy who stole her man. Do you think she can train me to be the most attractive woman? Q, come out. Dora, we are over, stop messing around. l love Pearl, you can never break us up. l will kick her ass and see whether you still like her or not. lf you are going to beat her then you have to kill me first. Pearl must be very pretty. Yeah! Charming. Sisters, get the bitch. Take off her clothes, shave all her hair. Dora, you don't have to be so cocky. A man?! You can't force a person to do things that he doesn't like. l can let you have Q back. But l don't think he wants to. l will tear your ass apart and see if you are still attractive or not. Watch your back! Q. Kill him! Yes! Don't mess around! You go first! Don't come any closer! l will killl anyone who come close to me. Dora Bingo! -Sorry! l have to go first. -Don't go! Sister Dora! Turn him over. Don't mess around! Don't touch! l still need it. Let me tear your ass. lf you still need a teacher, you have to help him now. Ask a man to be my teacher?! Females use breast and ass to attract man. Our body is our weapon. But think about it, a man with no breast and ass... can still have a man fall crazy for him. He must have something special. Am l right? How come a woman came to rescure me? Put on your pants first. Superwoman Ling, you saved my life... So much trouble recently... l saved you because l want you to be my teacher. l know! You got raped and your husband was killed! l am useless. l want to seek revenge! l want to be a woman who man willing to die for. No matter how attractive you become, you might not even get your revenge. lf l can't find them, l have nothing to say. But if l come across this chance, l want them to be all over me. Then they will never escape again! Black widow! l like you for you are real tough. Okay, l will teach you. When will we start? What's the hurry? Shave my leg first! "No one understands the girl's mind..." Actually, there is only one reason. You have to remember this, to get a man horny, you have to get into his mind. lf he thinks that you are pretty, no matter you are a man or a woman or something different, he will get horny. And have the greatest fun out of it. So if you want to tie down a man. You have to first get into his mind. There is no difference between bi-seXual and gay. A person can be bi-sexual and gay at the same time. Understand? Where should l start from? How would l know? Just go home and touch yourself in front of a mirror. Until one day you think that yourself is attractive, then you have succeed. What should l practise? Self-confidence! Here are ten video tapes, contain defferent gestures that men love the most. $3,000 each. lt must have all the top models around the world stared in it? No! l stared in it. Am l good? Very good! When you get him very horny, you can kill him easily. Just use all your strength and kick his G spot. His body will crumble. His body will be like ice-cream, very soft and defenseless. Man has G spot too? Of course! You think only woman has G spot? Where? Right behind their balls. Where? Damn it! l wanted to be decent, you know? Behind his dick and in front of his asshole! What are you looking at? You have a dick? Here! Look. lt is a small spot, it's hard to hit it! lt's important, so it's small. Not like your tits, they are too easily to be aimed. Okay, l'll just practise more. Do l have to listen to you? Practise! The red spot on that watermelon is man's G spot. Just kick it hardly. Because you bought all my vedio tapes, l will give you a special pair of high heel shoes. ls this yours? l used to wear that when l was performing! Go practise! Luckily l was prepared. Keep kicking it! Oh no! l spent another 50 dollars. Also this one. Very good! Remember, there is something important about man's G spot. lf you use it wisely, it can make a man feel very good. But if you kick it hard, he will be dead for sure. l will remember it. You've just graduated. Thank you teacher. Stay! l need you to do me a favor. What? Comfort my G spot, please. Look at yourself! The marital art contest between China and Hong Kong Police will start next mouth. You are the representative for the Hong Kong Police. We have high hope for you. l am ordering you. Get up. Come here and punch me. What is the matter with you? Come punch me! Now! Trash! Look at yourself! What's the matter with you?! Punch. Shoulder, chest and hips. Like this! Understand? Again... Use your legs! You do have legs, right? Harder! Use your hips! Legs with hips, understand? Where are you going? None of your business! This is the police force, you have to follow orders. Again. What's wrong? Something is bothering you? Ling is suffering so much, l'm worried about her! You still like her. You don't like Ling's personality. l know. But Sam was my best friend. l have to take care of her. This is our private business. Officer Leung, don't mind my business. Don't move. Madam, l am Ming. l found the two guys you are looking for. They always go to Lan Kwai Fong nowadays. What is taking them so long?! Hello! Baby, are you alone? You don't have to be like this! Bitch! Watch your back! Feel free to order, tonight is on me. Thanks... Yeah. The rest is tips. Thanks! Baby, thanks for the drink. You are happy and l am happy, is there anything l can do for this pretty lady? What can l do for you? Anything l can help? l can do anything for you! Tell me. That girl looks familiar. Baby, you are driving me crazy. Want to go to a motel with me tonight? Motel?! You are so cheap. You are cheap. At least you have to take me to a five star hotel! Right! Didn't you say that you have Viagra. Right! So what? Can your penis reach all the way to your stomach? lf not then it is not long enough for me! Please move. Move... Are you really leaving? l thought you would make me hot. Let me see if your tongue can really spin. Stupid, move! No pretty girl for you. Baby, am l right? Very cool. You got good taste, why don't you pick one of us? l don't like to play one on one, why don't you both bring it on? Really? You in the front l at the back. Let's play human sandwich. You like to play rough? l love it! Do you recognize her? Damn cop! You think we can't recognize you? You didn't have enough last time, did you? We will give you more fun today! You can go first. Let's go. l have been waiting for you for so long. Bitch! l will make you feel good today! Go to hell! Asshole! Go to hell! Didn't you have enough?! Go to hell! Do you still like me? You still like me, right? Ling. So what? lt can't change anything that had happened. Do you know, those assholes gave me STD. Do you know? lt can't help ever you know. l know you like me. But did you do anything for me? Have you tell me? Ling, on your last birthday, l had prepared a gift for you. But, l didn't take it out. The gift was my insurance. And my pension. lf l die during the line of duty, you will get the money. Kwan, this is not how you like a person. You have to show her that you like her. lf you told me that day. Or spoke your heart earlier than Sam did... l would have been Mrs. Wu already. All these horrible things wouldn't have happened to me. Ling, do you remember what wish did you make on your birthday? You wish to have different memories on every year's birthday. You are still young. You still have lots of birthdays left! Stop it! lt doesn't change a thing. l won't have a future anymore. Ling, listen to me... Leave! l want to be alone! Okay! You get some rest. l will come see you some other day. Ling, l wanted to tell you. l rather l die instead of Sam. l am not at home right now, please leave a message after the beep sound. Ling. Ling... Hello. Hello... Ling, l am Officer Ma, l know who is the masked murderer. Come to the gym when you hear this message. l will be there waiting for you. Officer Ma... Officer Ma is dead. Why did you kill Oficer Ma? l killed Officer Ma. You want to know why he is dead, right? l forced him to call you. After he made the call he found out my identity. So he must die. Who are you? l will tell you know. Officer Leung?! lt's you. So what? l didn't have anything to do with you. Why you rape me?! Why did you kill my husband? l didn't rape you. You bitch! l didn't like you before. You are trying to steal my boyfriend now! Are you gay?! You finally understand? You like Sam?! lf l like Sam l wouldn't have killed him. l like Kwan. lf you like Kwan Why you wanted to kill Sam, why did you to kill my husband? He didn't have to die at first. lt is all because of you, shut! After you played Kwan then you married Sam. You hurt him so l wanted to get even for him. l wanted them to rape you and then killed Sam. l want you to know the feeling of being hurt. l wanted to kill you too. But l don't want to hurt Kwan. You are bitch. You want to dead? You killed my Brother Yee. Look at Brother Three, he is in pain. The three of us were brothers ever since 20 years ago in the mental hospital. We have a good relationship. But you bitch. You killed him. You have to die. You have to die terribly. Don't move! Kwan?! Let her go. Stand over there. Kwan, listen to me. l heard everything you just said! l don't care if you are really insane or not. The only thing l can do for you is to arrest you. Kwan, you hurt me too much. You hurt me very much. Shut up! l don't want to hear it. Go back with me. You really want to shoot me? You broke my heart already... Shoot.
