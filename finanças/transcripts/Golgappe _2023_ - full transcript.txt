Praise thee, the Sun God! "Hail Lord..." Sorry, Lord. My moustache doesn't need to point up in your presence. "Hail Lord Almighty..." Jaggi isn't up as yet? Jaggi, you idiot! Why aren't you up as yet? Do you plan to get up when the bed kicks you out? Get up! "You take all our worries away." "Hail Lord Almighty..." Jaggi! You have to do all the chores. You have to do the dishes - and clean this place. - Someone make him stop. We don't have a maid. You will have to do all the chores. I'll kill him one day. Best revenge would be to fry you in a wok of boiling hot oil. "We get whatever we want." "All our sorrows go away." "All our sorrows go away, Lord" What? Stir the wok. It's easy... There is no milk in the wok. What do I stir? Stop holding that and start making some money. I don't know about making money, but try to argue with me again and I will certainly slap you, that too hard. If you would talk to customers instead, you too would make some money for yourself. I can only make money if you get any customers. Whom do I force to buy our sweets? Punditji, your sweets need to be powerful for the customers to come here. Powerful? Should I add energy pills in them? You should be powerful. I am powerful, aren't I? If I want, I can see dirt. Then why do you have me here. Just fill this place up with dirt and end the story. Nothing here is worth selling. Like you are worthy. You must be the first employee to badmouth the things you sell. What is wrong with fresh sweets. - Fresh sweet, huh? - Yes. Look at this. This looks like it was made pre-independence. Even the bus and the road was made pre-independence. They still work, don't they? This won't work. That Barfi? It has turned so yellow that I had to say it was made from gram flour to sell it. And these Ladoos? They are so hard that you can use it to nail something into the wall. Tell me what is harm with having hard Ladoos? Tell me one benefit of them. There will come a day when there is a fight at my shop. We will then use these Ladoos as stones. You will realize your mistake the day... You will realize your mistake the day these Ladoos send you to prison. Why do you need to make sweets with fake milk? Use some sense, you idiot. If you doubt my talent then give me what you owe me. Let's settle my account. I have it all on my fingertips. After deducting charges for your stay, food, drinks, it's Rs. 30,737. Fine, I will give you a discount of 37 rupees. Give me 30700 cash. Give it here. Give you what? That's what you owe me. Why do I owe you? I haven't seen real money since the time I have started working in your shop. After demonetization I don't even know whose face is on the currency notes anymore. Your mother's photo is on them. Didn't they have Bapuji's photo on them earlier? You guys will never change. You two fight like old hags whenever I come here for my money. Why? Do you get billed for our fights? No, I don't. But I do feel pity on you. Let me give you a free advice. You should distribute pamphlets along with the newspapers. Start doing home delivery. It will be good for your business. You will be able to return my money. They keep fighting all afternoon. Hey? What he said makes sense and is powerful. I think he is powerful. Want to join him? I regret joining you. Joining anyone else would be better than joining you. Join away then. I'll go prepare the matter for the pamphlet. Good riddance. Hello, Mom. God bless you, son. May you succeed in life. How's your work at the bungalow going? Work is great, Mom. I think I will have to clean all the bungalows. What? I had made so many bungalows. I need to look after them too. I am sure your boss must be happy with your work. He is so happy that he wants to give me a promotion of 30,737 rupees. But I refused. I said I'll take all the money at one go. Thank God! I will pray to God that you two always share such a good relationship. By the way, Neetu, your fiancée is here. Here, talk to her. Here. I'll go make us some tea. Talk to him, dear. Hello? Hi. How are you, Neetu? You don't talk to me anymore. Looks like you have fallen in love with the city. It is all because of love. You don't know what kind of Gol Gappes I am making for your love. Wrong phrase, the one to be used there is popadums. Everyone makes popadums. I feel I should always keep making Gol Gappes for you. You can make whatever you want, but my parents cannot wait anymore. They have already fixed three dates, but you keep postponing. I do that for a reason. How can we get married so soon? I want to have a wedding that the world watches. Bye. I'll talk to you later. Look... Help her up. You will have to admit her. She will get an injection every day. You should go to the counter and deposit 10,000 rupees. What? - You alright? - Deposit the money, I'll prescribe the injection. Okay, so I will get a room ready for her. Deposit 10,000 rupees at the counter. Okay. How will you arrange for that kind of money, son? If you want, I can ask them to give you a 10% discount. No, I just need to make a phone call and 100,000-200,000 will be deposited into my account. Don't worry, Mom. Your son will take care of everything. Okay. If you still need any help then let me know. I will help you. No, we have everything with the grace of God. We have a lot of money. If you need any help in getting a promotion then tell me. I'll just need to make a phone call. No, thank you. God bless you, son. Don't feel shy, dear. Let us know if you need any help. - Sure. - Yes. Let me know. It's not a problem. Mom, you wait here, I'll go and withdraw some money. - Okay? - Okay. Excuse me, please wait. You were saying that you could get me a 10% discount? If you can then it would be of great help. You just had to make a phone call, didn't you? What happened? You forgot the phone number or the account number? You know that my mother doesn't keep well. I was pretending to be rich in front of her. Actually, my mother sewed clothes to raise me up. I don't want her to know that I am unemployed. If you can help me then I'd be grateful. Fine, I'll try to get you 20% discount. You can deposit 8000, can't you? Wait, wait. If you could have it reduced some more? Fine, I'll try to get 30% discount saying that you are related to me. - Okay? - Hear me out. I was trying to say the more you can get it down the better. Fine. How much money do you have? 750 rupees. You should take her home. Treatment is a little expensive out here. It's not so. I will get her treated here. Even if I have to sell my kidney for it. No, that's not what I meant. Where are you from? Janetpur. Then buy these injections from the market. They are cheaper there. I will inject them to her on my way home. Are you sure? That works for you? Thank you. "Looks like she is covered in the hue of my love." "I can see love in her eyes." "Looks like she is going to open her heart out for me." "Looks like she is going to say yes to me." "Looks like she is going to say yes to me." "Now my name beats in her heart." "Now her love for me is visible in her eyes." "Beats in her heart." "Now my name beats in her heart." "Now her love for me is visible in her eyes." "My eyes always seek her. She too is going to fall for me." "Looks like she is going to say yes to me." "Looks like she is going to say yes to me." "Her bangles inform me of her arrival." "Her fragrance in the wind lets me know of her presence." "Of her arrival." "Her bangles inform me of her arrival." "Her fragrance in the wind lets me know of her presence." "She is going to express love through her eyes." "Looks like she is going to say yes to me." "Looks like she is going to say yes to me." Hello? Why is this beautiful face sad? It's not good to joke all the time. Then tell me what the right time to joke is. I will say my jokes then My family has stopped me from going to the hospital. That's a good thing. Your "Home Delivery" business is doing well. You come here every day. My family is getting me married. I see. They are getting you married. I am unnecessarily getting my mother shot for you and your parents are trying to find you a groom. Why is wrong? Am I not a man enough for you? Who will agree to get his daughter married to an unemployed man like you? Hello? Don't call me unemployed. I got a job. For real? Yes. Then I will talk to my parents. You should visit tomorrow morning. How about 5:00 am? You are not going for a morning discourse. You are going to meet your bride's family. Come over at 9:00 am. Fine, we will be there at 9:00 am. He is my brother. - Hello, Brother. - Hi. - She is my sister-in-law. - Hi. Hello, Sister-in-law. - Please have a seat. - Thank you. Neetu, where's your father? He has gone for a bath. Oh, I see. Jasneet, you too have a good look at him. She is your sister-in-law. It is better if you don't put this responsibility on me. I wouldn't have married you if I were smart. You ruined my life. Your father hasn't returned from his bath. Where has he gone for a bath? Kapal Mochan? Bathroom! Oh, I see. Hello, Father. No, son. I haven't said yes yet. You should address me as uncle. Oh. Hello, Uncle. Hi. What do you do, son? My shoelaces came off, so I am tying them. He means what work do you do? I see. Oh. I got offers from a couple of places, but I wanted to work at a place that makes you proud. - So, shall we take thing forward? - Why? Let's sit and discuss everything. He is talking about the marriage proposal. Oh, I see. Please, go on. We can only talk when Mother comes. But Neetu said her mother is dead. He is talking about your mother. I see, my mother. My mother? She will come. Don't worry. Hail Mother Goddess! Sister, kids these days make their own decisions. They just seek their parents' consent as a formality. It is not a bad decision, Brother. They make a nice couple. Okay then, if you like our girl then we like your boy. You won't find a girl as smart as Neetu even if you look for one with a lamp. That's the same case with me. Once there was a power outage in the village. Everyone kept looking for me with candles and lanterns in hand, but they couldn't find me. They kept looking for me. It was a joke. Jokes aside, everyone wants their daughter to marry into a nice family. Our girl is a naïve one. No! No. You are wrong, Brother. They are naïve before they get married. After marriage they become clever witches. Right, Sister-in-law? It was a joke. Yes, you are very funny. Now tell me, when do we schedule the wedding? You can keep it for tomorrow. It's not like I have to give her a dowry. I have to take dowry from her. It was a joke. Stop joking or they will refuse this match. When do we schedule the wedding for, Uncle? Don't call me uncle. Daddy then? When do we schedule the wedding for, Daddy? We will schedule the wedding. What is the hurry? You should first go to the city and settle down. - Excuse me. - I mean get a job. Look, I cannot tolerate anymore injections. He likes your daughter. He made me take more injections that a patient who is bitten by a dog gets. Brother, if you don't want them to get married so soon, then we should get them engaged at least. Okay, let's get them betrothed. "We have fixed the wedding date." "We have asked the goldsmith to make gold bangles for you." "We have fixed the wedding date." "We have asked the goldsmith to make gold bangles for you." "It feels like love is in the air." "She will soon be my wife." "She will soon be my wife." Hey! Which world were you lost in? How about doing some work? Keeps dreaming all day. What else can a poor man do other than dream? A poor man's dreams can come true if he works. I don't think I can buy a helicopter by cleaning your dishes. I think the beedi (cigarette) seller next door is doing better than us. He makes 2000 every day. You want me to stop selling sweets and start selling beedis? You won't even be able to sell beedis. I can only become rich using a shortcut. I just need to find that shortcut. Here's the shortcut. What is this? Get this pamphlet printed and have it distributed with the newspapers. Chawla Clinic, for piles treatment. We provide guaranteed non-surgical treatment for all kinds of piles. Dr. Paramjit Singh Chawla. Address: Near Gurudwara Singh Sabha, flat no. 1054. Check, is everything correct? Don't blame me for printing it incorrectly. It is fine. Just print them quickly. The newspaper guy will collect it from here. I'll print it. You seem to be in quite a hurry. Hi, Rinku. Hey Jaggi, what brings you here? You print pamphlets so I came here to get pamphlets printed. What else will I come here for? Don't get hyper and tell me what you want. Punditji wants to publish this pamphlet to expand his business. Print it. Know that it will increase his work and your tension. - How is it so? - What do I say? My boss too wanted to expand his business. He put some pamphlets distributed with newspapers. Now we have so much work that my child is sleeping when I leave home, and my child is sleeping even when I return home from work. I fear that if he sees me when he is awake, he will call me uncle. The rest is up to you. I'll print them if you want me to. It is my job to. Keep it there. Hello? Rinku? - Yes. - You wrote the wrong number? I wrote the wrong number? Yes. Where you sleeping? All the pamphlets have been printed. Change it. I'll have to change it on all of them. 'What are you waiting for?' 'Change the number before your relationship with your fiancée changes.' Okay. Yes, yes. Fine. 1000 more pieces. Okay. Okay. You'll get them day after tomorrow. Okay? Okay. Here, print it. - Okay, bye. - Okay, bye. Hello? Doctor, the bleeding won't stop. I have piles since three years. I am fed up of it. How many times have I told you that this is Nathu Halwai's number and not some piles doctor's number. Call back again, and I'll hit you with my slippers. Shameless! What is this? Your Gol Gappas are leaking. I cannot fix the leakage. Just have it. You can drink the water later. I need to fix the leakage in your mind. Hello? Doctor, I am in trouble. Piles are hurting me. What should I use? You should apply red chilies. Idiot! "Oh Jaggi!" Stop! Stop! Stop! Can you tell me where lane number 2 is? Lane number 2? Go straight then take a left and then a right. Then another right and another left. After taking the left, the lane on the right side will be lane number 2. I am confused. Oh, I see. Then do one thing, follow me. I too am going there. It is not right for a boy to follow a girl. Why don't I go with you? I know you won't refuse me. Here, hold my bag. Here. I know you will take me along. Don't worry, I'll share the fare. You know what? My father got transferred here. He bought a house here thinking then he'll shift us here, but God called him before he could call us. Later I learnt that he had given that house to his friend on rent. Now his daughter, Roopy has taken over the house. She behaves as if she owns the house. Look at me. In spite of having my own house I have to stay at Nathu Halwai's place on rent. How is this fair? What does that girl think of herself? I'll teach her a lesson once I meet her. I had told my father not to trust anyone so easily. But he didn't listen to me. Stop! Stop! Stop! Look, this is my house. Thank you very much. Look, you two are poles apart. You are angel. You let me share your rickshaw. And that witch deceitfully took over my house. You too are going here? Did that witch take something of yours as well? I am that witch. Look at this house again and I will break so many bones so badly, that even the doctor won't understand which bone belongs to the hand and which bone belongs to the leg. But this house belongs to my father. Then tell your father to come and get it. But he passed away. He is settled in heaven. Let us settle here. Leave. I will take my house back. Forget taking the house back, I challenge you to try to enter it. Act smart and I'll send you to where your father is. He thinks he is an honest man! I am not a coward! I swear upon my dead father, I won't leave the house till I don't get my house back. Father! What mess have you gotten me into? [Prayers] 'Oh God, please have mercy.' 'Help me get my house back.' My slippers? Hey! Wait right there! - Wait right there! Stop! - Hey! Hey! Hey! - Stop! Thief! - Listen to me. - No! - Police! Stop! - Are you mad? - You don't know who I am. Listen to me. What is wrong with you? You don't know who I am. Stop! Stop! Give me my slippers back. Give me my slippers back. Stop. Listen to me. Give it back. Give it back. - Tell me, what is it? - Give me my slippers back. Hey! Hey! Hey! You want the slippers? Here, where them. Hey! Hey! Hey! - You are mad. Stop it. - Get lost you slipper stealer! Stealing at God's abode! This is a city of thieves. Let me wear the slippers and file a complaint with the police Why don't they fit me? How did they shrink? Oh no. They indeed belonged to him. There he is. He stole my slippers in broad daylight. What times have come! Now you cannot even step out of your house wearing expensive slippers. What are you waiting for? Catch him! - Stop! - Get him. Oh no. Catch him! Make sure he doesn't escape. Make sure he doesn't escape. I hope he didn't change the straps. Huh? No, they are real. What mess have I gotten myself into? I am so dead. Nathuram, you took the money saying you'll give it back in three days. I need the money back desperately. My mother isn't feeling well. I need the money more than he does. Here, I am begging to you. Return my money first. My wife is expecting. Sir? Where does Mr. Nathuram stay? Everyone knows he always stays in trouble. Tell me what is troubling you. I am here from Mansa. So that's troubling you? No, my name is Pali. What's troubling you? That you are from Mansa or that your name is Pali? No, I want a room on rent. I see. Wait. Your mother is expecting, right? When did I say my mother is expecting? You just said your mother is expecting. I said that. I see. Your mother is expecting? My wife is expecting. How is that my fault? Wait. Doctor, I have piles since six months. It hurts a lot. What should I do? Punditji, should I paint? No, first use a sandpaper. A sandpaper, Doctor? Yes, use a sandpaper. Then clean the surface and if that doesn't work, use chalk and sand. Idiot! Don't call back. Disconnect the call. So your mother has piles? Piles? No. I want a room on rent. Then whose mother has piles? Raise your hand. We are here to collect our money. Okay. You will get your money. Don't worry. You will soon get your money back. But when? In a couple of days. I fold my hands request you to please leave. Let me run my shop. Let me make some money. - You will get your money in a couple of days. - We'll be back in a couple days, Mr. Great Shopkeeper. So you want a room. You will get the room, but you will have to pay 2000. Not a penny less or more. 2000? I don't have that kind of money. Then I don't have a room. I am desperate. Please give me a room. I won't even give you a brick if you don't pay me. How can you expect me to give you a room. I took pity on someone like you and gave him a room. Now he refuses to leave. 2000 is final. That's it. I don't have that much. I just have 800 rupees. Give me that. I'll collect the rest. That should be enough to get me liquor tonight. Come with me. Come on. Or will you come after I give the room to someone else? Okay. Let's go. You gave me 800 rupees. As far as the room is concerned, that's your room. That one. A boy is already staying there. You will have to share it with him. Mr. Nathuram, can I have a room for myself? I cannot sleep with someone else. If you cannot sleep, I'll come by to sing you a lullaby. King of Kalinga says he cannot sleep. Give me that room. Mumtaz, my darling, why don't I make you a new Taj Mahal for 800 you gave me? Don't you dare look at that room. It was taken by a theatre artist. He didn't pay rent for 6 months. I didn't give them their things back. Come, let me show you the washroom. Come with me. This is where you relieve yourself. And that's where you have a bath. - Punditji? - Yes? Give me a bucket of water. Why do you want water for? To wash my hands. Why don't I come inside and wash it for you? You cannot use the tap water inside? We are out of water because of leakage. Go, help him. Me? I won't wash it for him. Who asked you to wash it? Give me the bucket of water. Hurry up, Punditji. Go. Be a good boy. It will be difficult to wash it off once the stuff dries. Hurry up. It's soap water. He'll be able to wash it off quickly. Hurry up. Do you want to go in? Then what are you waiting there for? Come with me. I'll show you where the kitchen is. Okay. That's our kitchen. And this is the place where you will clean the utensils. Huh? I'll clean the utensils? Why do you think I gave you 1200 rupees discount? I will recover the money by making you wash the utensils. You thought I'd clean your clothes? Thief! Thief! Thief! Thank God we have thieves in our house. - Where are the thieves! - Thief! Thief! Thief! - What are you doing here? - What are you doing here? - You two know each other? - He stole my slippers. That's the first time I have heard about it. He stole my slippers today. You will learn a lesson when he will steal yours. Get out of here. Leave! Get out! Get out of here. - Get out of here. - Hey! Hey! Stop acting like a monkey. He paid me rent. He will stay here. I gave him 800 rupees. Really? I will pay his rent. Get out. Hey! Hey! Hey! Stop it! You will pay his rent huh? You cannot even pay your rent. You hide under the seat to avoid the bus conductor. He says he will pay rent. Get this straight, Punditji. Either he or I, only one of us will stay in this house. Fine then he stays. Go away! - Punditji? - Yes? I raised you like a father! Get lost! I prefer to disown a son like you. - Go away! - Really? Then I am going. - Get out. - I'll leave for good. Go. Or do you want me to drop you to the railway station? He is shameless. I'll punch you. - Why did you come back? - I won't leave. - Why? - I will leave only after paying my rent. Oh no. That means you will never leave. No, I am not going anywhere. Hello? Hello. What were you doing? Just working my legs. What? I was in the office. Office? So late in the night. Yes, was settling an account. I couldn't sleep so I thought I should call you. I wouldn't let you sleep anyway. I would trouble you in your dreams. Do you only plan to visit me in my dreams or you have plans to meet for real too? Soon. Okay listen, my brother and father are coming to the city tomorrow. Ask them not to come tomorrow. I have to go to Kota tomorrow. - Why? - To make a coat. To buy stones for the bungalows. Don't you know even that much? I'll be back in 50-60 days. I mean I will come back the day after tomorrow. Why don't you just say that you are differing the meeting. This won't last for long. Hello? Hello? Hello? Hello? - I think signal is bad because of the fog. - Hello? Hello? I need to go! - Jaggi! - I need to go! I need to go! Jaggi! What is this nonsense? You are shameless. Learnt from the best. Come out. I need to get to work. I have constipation. You should go do it in the fields. Son? This isn't an ATM that you are standing guard to it. Mr. Nathu, he was washing his clothes outside. He saw me and went inside. I need to go to work. Give him a chance. He paid rent. Come out. He needs to go somewhere. Everyone leaves one day, Punditji. No one can stay forever. Look, he is lying. He isn't doing anything in there. If you don't trust me, give me your phone. I'll click a selfie for you. You are elder. Why don't you go inside and check. You want an elder to see that first thing in the morning? Trying to take advantage of my age, huh? Get lost. Mr. Nathu! Mr. Nathu! Mr. Nathu! Jaggi! Wait, I'll teach you a lesson. Here you go! Wait, I'll teach you a lesson. You are doomed! There you go! Wait! Wait, I'll teach you a lesson! Stop! Mr. Nathu! Mr. Nathu! Mr. Nathu! Oh God! - You killed me. - Mr. Nathu! I told you Jaggi is bad. Go catch him! - Jaggi! - I am dead! Catch him! Jaggi! Catch him! Jaggi! - I won't spare you! - Wait! Listen to me! "Gol, Gol, Gol!" Mr. Nathu! Catch him! Catch him! Catch him! Catch him! Let me go! Catch him! - Let me go! - Beat him up! You hit me. You hit me. You hit me. Punditji, a girl. Pick it up! I cannot pick her up, she is heavy. Punditji, pick up your pajamas. Pick it up. - Whose? - Yours. Pick it up. Pick it up. Hello. It fell. Punditji! You guys are getting me embarrassed. Hurry up, Punditji. Done? I can come back later. No, come in. Have some tea. We do this every day. Our fights never end. Who are you? I'll tell you. She is a witch. Huh? Such a beautiful witch? She is the witch who took over my house. I think she got scared. She is here to give me my house back. Come here. Me? Yes, you. Come here. Don't make me kill you. Get this straight. I came here to tell you that decent people like in that society. If you go there and create a scene then I will be your worst enemy. Take this document and sign it. Sign on it? What will you write on it? I'll write that you have sold that house to us. You have taken the money for it. Have you lost your mind? I am not scared of anyone. I'll make you vacate the house. Even if I have to go the high court for it. Sign it. It will be better for you. You will sign, that too in prison when you'll be booked under section 420. My mother asked my father for a divorce. He gave it to her. But he didn't let go of my mother. It is a family tradition. We can die, but we don't let go of our possession. That house belongs to my father. I won't leave it. Never. Not at any cost. Is it so? You won't be able to walk if you step foot in that area again. Why? I'll break your legs. Got it? Sister! Feisty sister! - Hear me out. - Why are you following me? I am telling you, there is no use begging me. I won't leave the house at any cost. Hear me out. I won't listen to anyone. You thought I am all alone? I won't let anyone step inside that house. Just hear me out. No, you listen to me. I won't leave the house and that's final. That's what I am saying. Don't leave the house. You stay there. You have possession. The one who has the possession owns the house. The buffalo belongs to the one who has the stick. Sister, I came to tell you that you have my full support. Don't try to flatter me. I don't need your help. Fine, as you wish. I came to tell you that I could get him to sign that paper. But as you wish. Goodbye. My angel brother? Yes, you. Yes? Will you really help me? My aunt's sister was just like you. She is dead. I think her soul will rest in peace if I help you. Okay. Get him to sign this blank document. Consider it done. You won't just get his sign but an witness sign too. - Really? - Yes. Thank you. Have it. Come on, have it. What is wrong with you? Some drink when they are happy, some drink when they are sad. I drink because I don't have a father or a brother. I am your father, son. You are not. You didn't take long to disown me. Pundit, you never loved me like a father. Don't cry. Don't cry, son. I am your father. You want a drink? Yes. Here, have it. What is it, son? My father would have hit me with his slippers instead of giving me a drink. You say you are my father? Fine, I'll fulfill that wish as well. You... Tell me, am I your father now? Yes, you are. What is it, now? What is wrong? I don't have a brother. I am your brother. But you are my father. Nonsense! My brother would have hugged me. He would have loved me. Oh God! Who will I tie a Rakhi to? Don't cry, son. Don't cry. Make him your brother. Ask him. Son? Be his younger brother. Hey? He agreed! Thank God, I got a grown up brother, and a readymade father. Now find a mother. What is it, son? I will find myself a mother, but what if you two back out? - You don't believe me? - I don't. Do you want it in writing? Yes, give it in writing. Give me a paper. Give me a paper. You have it in your pocket. You cannot be trusted. What if you back out? Here. Sign here. Where? Where? Here. Right here. Over here. Sign it. Nathu. - Enough. - Let me write Nathuram. - That's enough. - Here. His too. - What? - Ask him to sign it. Sign here, son. Sign it before I make you leave the room. He doesn't consider me as his brother. Sign it. Write your name. "Gol Gappe! Gol Gappe!" - Yes. - That's enough. - Now I have it in writing. - "Gol, Gol, Gol!" You are my father. I have a family. Father! My son! My baby! "Gol, Gol, Gol!" Hello, Dr. Chawla speaking. I want 3 portion of Gol Gappes and 10 samosas and 1 kilo ladoos. How many times do I need to tell you that I treat piles and not a confectioner! Call me again and I'll file a complaint against you. Sweety! Sweety! - Mangu? - Yes? Where is my wife? Ma'am? She is over there. Sweety! What is it, Doctor? Am I a doctor or a confectioner? What do you mean? I had distributed pamphlets with the newspaper to get more patients. But all I am getting are some weird phone calls. Some want Gol Gappes and some want samosas. Why are you so angry? What is wrong? Look at Dr. Gupta. He has made a three-storied clinic using his fake degree. Who is stopping you? You make a four-storied clinic? Really? Why don't I build a Taj Mahal instead? Sweety, how many times do I asked you ask 2 million from your father? We cannot keep asking him for money. We got a car thanks to that. We got a house thanks to that. I don't understand what is wrong with asking for it now? I cannot do it. If you have trouble treating patients at home then work in a hospital. Okay. The main piles doctor of the city, Dr. Paramjit Singh Chawla should take up a job? Am I not a doctor? Don't I work under someone? You should work hard to have make your own clinic. Don't you see the hard work it takes to ask money from your father? You are blind! Mr. Chawla! "Mr. Chawla!" A pauper yet a mister. That's Dr. Chawla. A famous doctor in the city. He is loaded. Let's kidnap him. Hmm. Let's ask for 1 million rupees. Who will arrange for the money if you kidnap him? Idiots, the principle of our business suggest, the more innocent person you kidnap the more money you get. Let's kidnap his child. But he has no children. He has a wife, doesn't he? Yes. Let's kidnap his wife. Today, I won't leave without my Rs. 200,000! Pali! Come on out! I won't leave without the money! I am decided! I will either die or kill someone today. Come on out! Give me my money. What nonsense is this? Okay, this is nonsense? Give me my money back, 200,000 rupees and I'll stop this nonsense. I will get what I want. 200,000 for what? She says what 200,000? Your husband took it from me when your father-in-law died. He owes me 200,000! What husband and father-in-law are you talking about? I am not even married. Well done. You two are a couple made in heaven. He's a cheater and you are a gamecock. He secretly got married and didn't even inform me. Do I eat a lot? Is this what you call a friendship? Pali! Come on out! I see, you are talking about Pali? - Yes. - I'll break his legs! Don't you dare! Don't you dare say anything about my best friend's legs. Only I can break his legs. Sister-in-law, didn't Pali mention me or the money he took from me? Don't address me as sister-in-law. I am not your sister-in-law. How else do I address my best friend's wife? Should I call her aunt? Leave before I call the police. Call the police. Call the Celestial Judge! I won't leave without my money. I am sitting right here. Stand up. Don't trouble me. I see! You took my money and I cannot even trouble you? Pali! Come on out! Pali doesn't stay here. He stays at Nathu Halwai's place. He doesn't stay here? He stays at Nathu Halwai's place? I am sorry. Forgive me thinking that I am your only single brother-in-law if I have said anything untoward. Okay, bye. Pali! Do you know where Pali is? Which Pali? I don't know. You don't know Pali? Do you know where Pali stays? No one knows about Pali? Does anyone know where Pali stays? Does anyone here know Pali? Where does he stay? Do you know where Pali stays? He died last week. How can he die? He can only die from my hands. He owes me 200,000 rupees. I won't let him die. He says Pali is dead. - Yes? - Brother? Which Pali? Pali whose mother's natal house is in Malot. The one whose aunt ran away. He is hiding at some Gol Gappa place here. Okay! What if I take you there? Be a good brother and take me there. Please, Brother. You will beat him up? I'll turn him black and blue. I am not my mother's child if I don't. "He went out for 12 years and came back with a bear." "Get on my bicycle and I'll be happy to take you there." - God bless you. - Pali, I am bringing your uncle with me. Come with me, Uncle. Wait, wait, wait. God bless you, Brother. Pali, my brother. Pali! Pali! Pali! Look, your relative is here. Pali! Who is it? Shamsher? Your uncle is here. You dog! Don't you have any shame? You took the money from me and came here to hide? You thought I won't find you? I can find you even if you are hiding in hell! No! Don't fight. Just talk it out. Take it easy. Take it easy. Give me my money back. I want to get my sister married. You took that money from me and came here to hide. I will kill you. I don't know how, but give me my money back. - Give me my money back. - Hey! Give me my money. Who are you? Why are you hurting that kid? He is not a kid. He is a cheater. Don't interfere. If anything happens to you, I'll become an orphan. You are old. What if you get hurt? We don't have money for treatment. Let them fight. Let them settle their account. Don't interfere. Look, he too is saying that you don't interfere. Move aside. - Give me my money back. - Let him go. Don't hurt that money man. Let him go. Damn it. Ruined the fun. Are you going to stop or do I hit the ladle on your head? You were hugging him while drunk. "He is my brother!", you said. What kind of a brother are you? He is my brother. But he won't mend his ways. He owes him money. Yes, he does. What does he owe you? Ask him. He asked for 200,000 when his father died. I like a fool gave him all the money I had saved for my sister's wedding. After that, he came here hid himself. He doesn't want to pay me back. Have some shame. You know what my sister said when I went looking for you? She said, "Brother, even if it means that I don't get married," "but you shouldn't force Pali to pay you back." She considers you as her brother. Be a good brother. I am begging you. Please give me my money back. I won't be able to get my sister married otherwise. She will have to stay home. Be a good brother, please. - Enough. - I beg to you. I plead to you. Be a good brother, and give me my money back. Don't do this. I'll pay you back on Friday. Which Friday. This Friday. Trust me. She is not just your sister. She is my sister as well. If you don't give me the money on Friday, on Saturday, I'll come here with my men. - No. - I won't kill you, - I will kill myself. - No! Then those men can take my dead body away. Be a good brother, I am begging you. We need to get our sister married. Our honor is at stake here. Okay, bye. Thank you very much, Brother. You came to me like God. Bye. My guarantee ends on Friday. Otherwise, be here on time on Saturday. Bye. Are you going to win a lottery on Friday? Then how will you arrange for the money? I'll arrange it somehow. I have faith in God. Oh God, don't break his trust in you. Hello? Why don't you call me? How can I call you? I am so busy with work. Lovers have to work. Ranjha too collecting Heer's dung for 12 years. He collected Heer's cattle's dung. Listen? I'll bring a band along the day I come to marry you. I don't care how you come, I just want you to come. You know what my family says? They say that you have changed after going to the city. I haven't. I am just busy in work. You can come and see if you want. That should work. If you cannot come here, we can come there. We'll come there tomorrow itself. Hello? Are you serious? No, I don't want any excuses. - We're coming there tomorrow. - Hello Neetu, listen... Hello Neetu, I... Hello? You have gotten yourself into a big mess. Roopy! Roopy! What is it? You want me to leave this house to you? You want to live her? I already live her. You have forcefully taken possession of this house. I am talking about give it to you permanently. What do you mean? I mean I am ready to sell this house to you for only 200,000. I am ready to sign the document if you'll give me the money. You have already signed the document. You have nothing to do with this house. You don't believe me? Wait here. Look at this. This clearly proves it. 'Jaggi, you cheater!' What are you doing? I got rid of it. Now get this straight. Either vacate the house till evening or give me 200,000 rupees. Otherwise, I will be your worst enemy. See you in the evening. Huh? Jaggi? Come on. Come with me. Hello, sir. We seek your blessings. Hey! It's okay. Neetu, Daddy didn't come? His gets cramps in his feet. No problem. We have carpenters working inside. We will get him a wooden leg. I mean, I... There he is. Look at this. I got a contract to build this bungalow. I have become a famous contractor. Come this way. It belongs to someone else. Have a look. Have a look. Jaggi, when will you pay us? Money? I will pay you. Be patient. Come on. Come with me. Good job. Well done. Daddy, isn't it beautiful? It is a beautiful bungalow, son. I didn't make it, masons did. I think you should raze your bungalow. I'll build a similar bungalow in just 3 months. No, son. My daughter is about to get married. I need to the money. Your daughter isn't going to run away. You can get her married later. Your bungalow is more important. Think about it. Will it look nice if the roof leaks when your son-in-law comes over? I am just joking. Enough of jokes. Let's get to work now. That reminds me, I have 25-30 people working under me, but not even 20 showed up. Look, what times have come. Here I am! I seek your blessings, Uncle. I seek your blessings, Mr. Jaggi. Mom? Mr. Jaggi's Mom? I seek your blessings, Mom. Who is he? I... I am one of the 20-25 people who work under him. His favorite worker. - I see. - Right, Mr. Jaggi. My boss? Mom, you know he is such a liar, such a liar... Listen to me! Listen to me! Listen to me! Wait! Mom, you know he is such a liar he didn't even tell me that you are coming over. Look at the love. He is folding his hands before a worker. That's our Mr. Jaggi for you. Should I tell Mom? Mom, I used to have a small house here. But your son deceitfully made me sign that place to someone else. Gave it away in charity, didn't you, Mr. Jaggi. Then he bought me a bigger house. He is very generous. Boss, you bought me a house. Now, how about you give me my salary? Come on, come on, come on. Only 400 rupees? It's okay. I'll take the rest from your cashier. Rich people don't carry too much cash anyway. Jaggi, if I wanted, I could have exposed you. But I am not a scoundrel like you, who likes to turn others' joy into sadness. I can never forget what you did to me. Okay, Mom, see you around. Bye, Uncle, see you around. Bye, boss. Halwai! Well done! Well done, my boy! I am Halwai now, huh? Not Mr. Nathuram anymore? I guess I will have to ask you to pack your bags as well. You know Shamsher's sister will never get married. Why? You didn't get the money from where you were supposed to? I cannot kill the one who is already dead. I am their only child. She is paralyzed. Tell me, where can I take her in this state? You mean her state is worse than ours? Life has put all of us in a tight spot. But some scoundrels, people like him, prefer to lie to their family. He is making his mother and his fiancée dream big, whereas he cannot even afford to fix a flat tire! He is a liar! He is deceiving his mother! A mother who gave birth to him! Should I kill her by telling the truth instead? Should I tell a mother who raised me by cleaning utensils, that her son too cleans utensils out here? My mother thinks her son has a nice job. She just wants to see me get married. I can lie to make my mother happy. I can kill anyone if I have to. I... I love her a lot. I don't want to lose her. If you had told her the truth, then she would have... Please forgive me for lying to you and hurting your feelings. Fools! There is no one in this world who is not sad. I have experienced that sorrows decrease and happiness multiplies when shared. Let's celebrate today! Let's celebrate so much that it makes all our sadness disappear. "Today, I shall make all the worries disappear." "Today, your buddy will ace this for sure." "Your buddy will ace this for sure." "Today, I shall make all the worries disappear." "Today, your buddy will ace this for sure." "Today, we get drunk and drown our worries away." "Today, we get sloshed and trouble our neighbors." "This group of single men..." "This group of single men will party all night, girl." "This group of single men will party all night, girl." "This group of single men will party all night, girl." "It's time to celebrate..." "She rocked my boat," "She rocked my boat," "when she winked at me while washing clothes." "She rocked my boat," "when she winked at me while washing clothes." "Today, friends will get together and celebrate." "We will talk about our girlfriend and our baes." "We will talk about them." "Today, friends will get together and celebrate." "We will talk about our girlfriend and our baes." "Some will get drunk." "Some will sing." "We will make a lot of noise tonight." "This group of single men..." "This group of single men will party all night, girl." "This group of single men will party all night, girl." "This group of single men will party all night, girl." "This group of single men will party all night, girl." Hello? Bagga speaking. Your wife... We have kidnapped her. Good job. He thinks it's a joke. Listen? Don't disconnect the call. Your wife is with us. If you don't believe me then hear my voice. Please! Help me! Please! Please! Heard her? Neetu? If you love your wife, keep 1 million ready. I'll call tomorrow night at 10 and tell you where to deliver the money. Don't inform the police. Otherwise, your wife will be fed to the dogs, Chawla! Punditji! Pali! Wake up! Get up! - Get up! - I cannot drink anymore. I am sloshed. Forget the drinks. My fiancée has kidnapped the goons. I mean goons have kidnapped my fiancée. They kidnapped your fiancée? Yes. Some Bagga had called. He said he has kidnapped my wife. I need to keep 1 million ready if I want her to live. Forget 1 million, you cannot even give him 10 rupees. Let's go inform the police. No! No! No! We cannot do that. Bagga said, "Don't inform the police." "Otherwise, your wife will be fed to the dogs, Chawla!" What did he say? "Don't inform the police." "Otherwise, your wife will be fed to the dogs, Chawla!" What? Don't you understand? How else do I say it? Bagga said, "Don't inform the police." "Otherwise, your wife will be fed to the dogs, Chawla!" Who the hell is Chawla! The piles doctor! Your wife too has piles? - No. - Then who has piles? This conversation is going to give me piles. I don't understand anything. But I understand everything. Now make us understand. - Punditji? - Yes? Remember, we distributed pamphlets with newspaper to expand our business? But to avoid extra work, I had replaced our number with the piles expert Dr. Chawla's number. Chawla's wife got kidnapped and we received the call. It happened because of our phone numbers got interchanged. That's why I used to get calls where people used to say it burns. Some used to say that it won't stop bleeding. I never got a call for sweets or samosas. You idiot, do you have any idea how much loss I incurred because of your stupidity? Punditji, what if I compensate your loss in many folds? How will you compensate me? I can compensate you, but for that, we will have to play a small game. Are you expecting your mother to come here to play Ludo in the middle of the night? Hear me out. God knows who needs to get what and when. It is our turn now so He is giving it to us. Look Bagga called us thinking we are Chawla. We will call Chawla pretending to be Bagga. We will collect money from Chawla and give it to Bagga. That's it. We will collect money from Chawla and give it to Bagga. Then what will we get? Peanuts? "Oh Jaggi!" That's when Jaggi's plan comes into motion. Look, Bagga has demanded 1 million from Chawla. We will demand 2 million from Chawla. We will give 1 million to Bagga and get Chawla's wife back. The balance 1 million gets distributed between all three of us. "Gol Gappe! Gol Gappe! Gol Gappe! "Gol Gappe! Gol Gappe! Gol, Gol, Gol!" No! This is wrong! Then get ready to get thrashed by your uncle. Stupid, you will always regret if your friend's sister's wedding gets called off. Punditji, you too should start thinking about renting a house. Someone will soon take possession of this house. All our problems will go away if we get those 1 million rupees. You are right. I am with you, son. Mr. Nathu! Don't listen to him. He will get us into trouble. Do you have any other option? What do I need to do? "Gol, Gol, Gol!" Phone. Phone? At this hour? Here, Pali. Talk like a goon. What do I say? Talk about my wedding. Talk like a goon. Talk to him! Hello? This is Pali speaking! Bagga! Bagga! This is Bagga Bagga speaking! Only once Bagga! This is only once Bagga speaking! Don't you know how to talk like a goon? I didn't train to be a goon. You talk to him. It's okay. Don't worry. I will talk to him. - You will talk to him? - Yes. My maternal uncle was a dacoit. I stayed at my mother's natal home till I was in the fifth grade. Don't worry. Call him. - Should I? - Yes. Who is it? Hello? Chawla! - You are Chawla, right? - Yes. You don't know who I am. No, I don't. This is Jagga speaking! No, I am Bagga speaking! I don't care. I treat piles patients only in the morning. He didn't get scared. He disconnected the call. - Huh? - Yes. Hello, Mr. Chawla! Hello? Hello? Hello? Hello? Mr. Chawla? Here, talk to Mr. Bagga. Okay. Chawla, you are under an oath. You cannot disconnect the call without hearing me out. This is Bagga, the notorious goon speaking. We have kidnapped your wife. Sweety? Looks like he has gone to inform the police. I was too scary, wasn't I? It's okay. Hello? Sweety? What is wrong? Where's my wife? She isn't back from the hospital yet. - Really? - Yes. Her duty was supposed to end at 12. Why do you look so scared? No, you go. You go. Hello? Hello? Hello? Hello? Talk to him! - Hello? - I will do as you say, Mr. Bagga. Please don't hurt my Sweety. How can I not hurt your wife? Sweety! Sweety! If you love your wife, keep 2 million ready. 2 million? I'll call back and tell you when and where to deliver the money. Thank you. - Help! Help! - Yours faithfully, Bagga, Bagga, Bagga! Bagga, brother! Hear me out! Hello, respectable Mr. Bagga? I managed to scare him. "Gol Gappe! Gol Gappe! Gol Gappe!" "Gol Gappe! Gol Gappe! Gol, Gol, Gol!" "Gol Gappe! Gol Gappe! Gol Gappe!" "Gol Gappe! Gol Gappe! Gol, Gol, Gol!" Roopy? Hmm? God has fixed everything. We won't need to worry about the money any more. Why? Did you hit a jackpot? Something like that. As soon as I get the money, I will get your mother treated. We will vacate your house once Mom gets well. You don't need to leave the house. Why? Because I don't want you to vacate the house. "Today, you have become special for me." "You have become my hope." "You have become my belief." "My heart has decided," "Never to let you go." "I haven't seen God," "He too must be just like you." "I haven't seen God," "He too must be just like you." "Today, my heart is singing with joy." "My dreams and desires are about to be fulfilled by my beloved." "My dreams and desires are about to be fulfilled by my beloved." "Your presence fills the air with a pleasant fragrance." "I haven't seen God," "He too perhaps must be just like you." "I haven't seen God," "He too perhaps must be just like you." "Like morning dew on the petals," "My beloved too refreshes my day." "I don't remember how my days or evenings go by," "From the time I have fallen in love." "I cannot sleep," "And I don't want to sleep." "I haven't seen God," "He too must be just like you." "I haven't seen God," "He too perhaps must be just like you." "My heart skips a beat whenever I see you. "My soul will feel alive if you become mine." "I pray to God for your wellbeing." "My days and nights are filled with your love." "Don't break my heart," "I want to spend the rest of my life with you." "I haven't seen God," "He too must be just like you." "I haven't seen God," "He too perhaps must be just like you." Daddy. What is it, son? You sounded worried over the phone. Is everything fine? Nothing is fine. Sweety... Sweety? What happened to Sweety? She hasn't returned from her shift last night. Bagga, the goon, has kidnapped her. Kidnap! Why? What does he want? Money. How do I arrange for the money? Don't worry, son. We will support you. How much money is he asking for? Give him whatever he asks for. Money is not more important than Sweety. How can I ask for 4 million rupees from you? 4 million? Hmm. They will kill Sweety if we don't give them 4 million rupees. Arrange for the money. If anything happens to my daughter, I won't forgive you. Don't worry, I'll arrange for the money. Thank you, Daddy. Thank you, Mummy. Come on! Hello? Bagga speaking. Hi. Hmm. Are the goods ready? We always have a ready stock of 5-7 kilos. Stop blabbering. I am talking about the money. Oh, the money! Yes, the money is ready. Have you ever seen Chawla? Huh? - Ask him. - You...! Mr. Bagga, have you ever seen Chawla? No. Then how will you recognize him? I mean how will you recognize me? I will recognize you when you will come alone. Listen? Tomorrow at 05:00 am, meet me behind the government school with the money. Okay. One more thing. If you inform the police, I'll cut your wife into pieces-- You'll cut my wife into pieces and feed it to the dogs. I know. You are smart. Bye. Tomorrow at 05:00 am, behind the government school. Answer it. Hello? Chawla! This is Bagga speaking. Yes? Meet me tomorrow with 2 million rupees, behind the government school at sharp 05:00 am. Not 05:00 am, that's when Bagga will come there. - Ask him to come sooner. - Yes, yes, yes. Yes. I just learnt that we have other things to do at 05:00 am, that's why be there 2 hour before 05:00 am, that is at sharp 03:00 am. Okay, okay. Why are you calling him 2 hours early? Where will we do there for that long? What okay, okay, huh? It is easy for you to say okay. What will we do there for 2 hours? That's why be there at sharp 04:00 am. One more thing. If you act smart, then I'll cut my wife into pieces and feed it to the dogs. Would you like to hear your wife? Yes. Then here you go. Make some noise, you scoundrels. Make some noise. Wake up! Wake up! Wake up! Your husband wants to hear you. Wake up! She won't wake up because she is unconscious. But you can hear the hungry dogs we will be feeding your wife to. Bark like a dog! Hungry dogs! Heard them? At sharp 04:00 am. What did he say? What did he say? He agreed! Check it. Hello, sir. Come, Mangu. What brings you here? How is Mr. Chawla doing? I am here to talk about him. Is everything fine? Nothing is fine. His wife hasn't come home since last night. Mr. Chawla too is worried, because someone has kidnapped her. Kidnapped her? I heard everything last night. Mr. Chawla isn't telling anyone because he is scared. You should do something. Don't worry, I will do something. Inform me as soon as you learn anything. Okay. - Go home. - Okay. - Sukhchan? - Yes, sir? Keep an eye on Dr. Chawla. Where he goes, who he meets, what he does. I want information about every move he makes. Okay, sir. I don't care. I won't give you extension. Your Friday is over. Today is my Saturday. I will take the money from you today. Tell me whether you are giving me the money or not? If you are not giving it then I have four men with me. These four people will take my dead body from here today. Have some shame. You cheat! You liar! Today because of you, I will... Give it here. I will die today. Look Brother, I have seen many people die because of taking debt. You have to take the money from him. Why are you dying? Shamsher, you don't need to die. I have arranged for the money. Money is coming! Money is coming! Money is coming! Money doesn't have tires on them to come here on their own. He acts like he has trucks running in Dubai. Shera, I think he is a fraud. - Should we take care of him? - Stop! Stop! I said no! No! Look Brother, I heard him talk. He said he wants all the money on Monday. Right? Listen to me. Remember, I was the one who brought you to him on my bicycle, on the first day. - Yes. - I took you to him right? - I gave you the guarantee till Friday? - Yes. I am extending my guarantee for 2 more days. Now my guarantee lasts till Monday. - Happy? - Okay? He is right. I swear on you. Oh, God! He once again swore on me. Come here. Come here. I get into trouble whenever you swear upon me. Shera, you are taking too much time talking to them. If there is time for you to die then can we go have a cup of tea? Stop! This is the last warning. If you don't pay me this time... Listen carefully. You have to hit my head with a stick and kill me. Shera, if we are anyway going to come back then can we keep this here? - Why bother carrying it here every day? - No! This man cannot be trusted. He will sell this as well. I will die right here. The place will be filled with dead bodies. I will forget everything! I will die! I will die right in front of your shop! - I'll die for sure. - Bye, Uncle. All you guys, all my creditors, I want you to write down what I owe you on a book and come over tomorrow. I will repay all of you. When will I repay you? - Tomorrow. - Hmm. Tomorrow all of you should come to my house, bathed, without eating anything. I will settle everyone's account. One more thing. Bring your poor relative along with you. It's not like I can take the money with me after I die. Pali, how much do I owe you? 50,000 rupees. That's all? I'll give you 100,000 rupees. You owe me 50,000, not 100,000. Then you will owe me 50,000. Then I'll come to your house every day to ask for money. Then you'll know how bad I feel when you show up to my house early in the morning to ask for money. Are you sure we will get our money tomorrow? Sure? When I will kidnap your wife, you will beg to me and say, "Mr. Nathuram, here's 2 million rupees." "Please give me my wife back." But I won't return your wife. What woodwork do you want me to do, Nathu? What are your daily wage charges? 600 rupees. Take 1200 rupees. But you should call me, Mr. Nathuram and not Nathu. Mr. Nathuram. Right. This bathroom... I think, I should put an expensive wooden door on it. Fine, I'll put an expensive wooden door on it. Give me the money. I'll go and get the wood from the market. You need to start the work from tomorrow. I'll give you all the money tomorrow. Then tell me, which expensive wood should we use here? Use sandalwood. It will also keep the room fragrant. Mr. Nathu! It's almost 04:00 am. Let's go collect the money. I am gathering the sacks to collect the money. I am not gathering them to get vegetables in them. It's money, not coal. - Let's go. - Let's go. Wait. Listen? What are you wearing? Scheme. So that no one can recognize us. Oh nice! No one should recognize you, and they should beat me up so much that I become unrecognizable? No! Mr. Nathu, we brought one for you as well. - Okay, okay. - Wear it so that we can leave. Let's go. Let's go hurry up. I am right behind you. Damn it! - What happened? Mr. Nathu? - Someone broke my skull open! - Are you alright? - I am dead! Where is your face? Where are you hiding? Your eyesight is fine. You have worn the cap wrong. I cannot see anything. I lost my eyesight. Wear it correctly. Wear it correctly. Look. Look, how handsome you look in it. Don't worry. Everything will be fine. I have arranged for the money, son. Here, go and give it to them. Let's go with him. I am not going for a picnic. I am going to save Sweety, Mom. Son, I suggest you should reconsider your decision. DSP is my friend. We can call the police if you want. We can. But if they see the police with us and hurt Sweety... No son, go alone. - Go. - It contains 4 million? You don't need to ask. It contains 4 million rupees. - Let's go, young man. - Get in. Step on it, boy. Mr. Bagga? I am Bagga. Good evening, Mr. Bagga. Talk in your mother tongue. Hello, Mr. Bagga. Where is my wife? Where is the money? Let me see my wife first. You still haven't seen your wife? We haven't come here with a wedding proposal. Don't try to act clever. Give us the money and you will get your wife. Please, let me see my wife first. Stop saying that! Do we look like marriage brokers to you? We are kidnappers. Give us the money. I'll give the money only after you show me my wife. Your wife isn't a sweet which we can make instantly. Brother Bagga, looks like he won't agree. Should I shoot his wife? No. Don't shoot my wife. Take the money. The pistol? Put it in your pocket. Give it here. Open and check whether it has money or clothes in it. It has money in it. I still don't trust him. Count the money. Sometimes they give less money or worn out notes. Sit down. - Give me 2000 rupees notes. - Count. Come on. Come on. Give them here. Oh no! - Police! - Police? - Damn it. - Police? - We are doomed. - Run! Don't you dare try to run! I will shoot you! Real police, Brother. We are caught. What's with this monkey cap? Take them off. It's quite cold out here. We will catch a cold. Don't worry. I will give you steam in the police station. Steam? More police? Give me the bag! Arrest them. No! Let it be. Don't arrest them. No, listen to me. Who asked you to come here? We are here to help you. I don't need your help. I just want my Sweety back. Don't act childish. Your wife will be fine. They will run... - Get them! - Let's go! Run, Punditji! Walking isn't enough, Punditji! Start running! My legs are quivering out of fear. How can you ask me to run? Punditji! Where do we turn? It's not like you need to turn on an indicator. Turn at the next turn. Let's go! Let's go! There they are, sir. They are getting away. Stop or I will shoot you. Don't shoot! Don't shoot! - Everyone in one voice... - Hail Goddess! - Everyone in one voice... - Hail Goddess! - Louder... - Hail Goddess! - Everyone in one voice... - Hail Goddess! - Louder... - Hail Goddess! - Everyone in one voice... - Hail Goddess! - Hail Goddess! - Hail Goddess! - Hail Goddess! - Hail Goddess! - Hail Goddess! - Hail Goddess! Run! Run! Run! I don't understand, how did the police come there? Police is bound to come when you kidnap someone's wife. You cannot expect a money order! - Hail Goddess! - Hail Goddess! - Hail Goddess! - Hail Goddess! - Everyone in one voice... - Hail Goddess! Get out of my way! Sukhchan! Save me, Goddess. I will give you a golden dome. He doesn't have enough money to buy an umbrella and he is offering an dome. Punditji! How many times have I told you not to trust him? Look, he got us into trouble. - Hail Goddess! - Hail Goddess! Give way. Move aside. They left. Hail Goddess! Hail Goddess! Hail Goddess! Hail Goddess! - Hail Goddess! Hail Goddess! - Thank God! Hail Goddess! Chawla didn't show up, boss. It's okay. He will have come. Should I shoot her? Wait. She is a woman and not an elephant that makes you more money when dead. She is worth 1 million alive. She has no value as dead. Let's talk to him. I am worried about her. I hope they don't hurt her. Don't worry. Nothing will happen to Sweety. Kidnappers want the money and we are ready to give it to them. By the way, son, the money? It is safe with me. If you want, I can give it back. We don't want the money. We want Sweety. We would have gotten her back if the police hasn't showed up. But... who called the police in the first place? I'll answer it. - I'll talk to him. - You got us into trouble. Now go and talk to him. - Okay. - Go. I'll go and talk to him. Hello? I am Bagga speaking, Chawla. Hello. We were waiting for you. Why didn't you come? You took my wife away. A lot of laundry was pending. I started washing clothes. I was too late by the time I realized I need to be somewhere. I thought you must have left by then so I didn't bother coming. I was helpless. You were helpless? I'll show you what helplessness is. Look, I will give you another chance. If you don't show up this time as well, I'll cut your wife into pieces and feed it to the dogs. Okay. I'll call again and tell you where to meet me next. Okay. Bye. Yes? What does he say? He said I'll cut your wife into pieces if you make such a mistake again. He'll call again and tell us where to meet him. Listen... this time we will go there prepared. You...! You are trouble! You will get us killed! Why do you want to kill a poor man's wife? Look, I am begging to you. Fear God. We don't want that kind of money. Your shortcut almost got us arrested. We were going to die trying to get rich. Only a stupid dog or a donkey would do as you say now! You inauspicious fellow! Why were you born like this? We would have been in prison if not for my good fate. You know they give stale bread with watered down lentils in prison? Like you eat a feast out here. Heard that! I told you not to trust him. You got drunk and made him your son. Your son almost got us killed. I will rather polish shoes, collect cow dung, drive a rickshaw, lose an arm and beg at the station than do this bad thing ever again. I don't understand, why do need to worry when I am here? He's calling! He's calling! - Don't let him answer it! - You answer it! You answer it! Let me go! - I cannot breathe. I am dying. - I won't let you go! - Let him go! - I won't. Don't answer it! - Answer it! - Don't answer it! - Answer it! - Don't answer it! Hello, Mr. Dacoit. Let me tell you the truth. None of us is Chawla. This isn't Chawla's number. We were just joking. Doctor, it has been hurting a lot since many days. It is bleeding profusely as well. Where do I go? What should I do? Set your bum on fire and you will soar high. You dog! You rascal! How many times have I told you not to call on this number? Call here again and I will shoot you and break your head. Disconnect the call, you dog! Thank God for this day, Brother. I trusted you and fixed my sister's wedding. Here's the wedding invite. Bring your friends along as well. You know how happy my sister? She said, "Brother, didn't I say my brother Pali can never cheat me." Is everything fine? Hmm. Brother, I have put my faith in you and fixed my sister's wedding. Please don't disappoint me. Don't worry. God resides in the house where a wedding takes place. I don't care if God shows up. Just make sure that you show up. If you don't show up, I'll show up at God's place. Don't say that, Shamsher. Your sister is getting married. It's an auspicious occasion. I forgot in all that excitement. Okay bye, I'll get going. I have a lot of work to do. We also have to set up the kitchen. Okay bye, I'll get going. Let's go. Be a good brother and attend the wedding. Hmm. I'll jump into boiling hot oil and die if you don't attend it. No. I don't care if I turn into a fritter. Be a good brother, okay? My honor is at stake here. Be there. Let's go, Brother. So, should I begin the work? You will pay me 1200 per day, Mr. Nathuram? 1200? Call me Nathu. Why? It is not as easy to kidnap someone else's wife as people think. What are you saying? You said you want to install a sandalwood door here. Sandalwood? I am thinking of selling this iron door too. Let me know if you have a client who wants it. I think we will replace it with a curtain. That will bring in light as well as fresh air. What do you think about my scheme? We are here as you requested, Mr. Nathuram. We have bathed and haven't eaten anything. Why haven't you eaten anything? I am not going keeping a prayer meet here. No, Mr. Nathuram. I think you forgot. You asked us to come here today. - You are going to pay us. - Pay you? But I didn't organize any prayer meet. Why should I pay you? Don't worry, we have a lot of money lying inside. Just tell me which currency notes would you prefer, 100 or 2000? Give whatever you want. Just pay us back. I will, Brother. I will. Wait for some more time. Wait some more? Give us our money back We are begging you. Nathuram, you had said that we should collect our money today. Now I am saying that I don't have the money. I had got the money, Brother. I was counting it but the police showed up. Then? They took the money away. They were going to take me away. I had to run to save my life. He won't pay us back. Looks like we will have to take over his house. Look Nathuram, we will throw your things out and take over your house, if you don't give us our money back. How will he pay you your money back when he couldn't pay me money for painting the house. Doing good never pays nowadays. Remember, we will take over your house. Let's go. I'll want Jagga as my servant. I don't care who takes over the house. Will they keep insulting me like that every day? Looks like I will have to rent another house. Who knows who will take over this house! They want to keep tenants! This house is the only ancestral property I have. I think I am about to lose it. I don't know how will God forgive me for calling off a poor man's sister's wedding? Come, let's fry fritters in water. Oh yes, I have to make sweets with water as well. Come on, Punditji. We need to make Ladoos with water as well. God wanted to make someone rich. He threw a bundle of money in front of him. When he came close to it, he closed his eyes. He said, "let's see how a blind man walks." Some people are honest to their core, even if it breaks a poor man's sister's wedding. Even if a poor man loses his house because of it. Even if someone's wife dies. Why should they bother? Listen up. If Bagga calls again, I will tell him the truth. I'll ask him not to call here again. We are honest people. What will I do all by myself anyway? It's not like I have anyone's support. I am with you. Mr. Nathu! Mr. Nathu, listen to me! Mr. Nathu, don't trust him. He will get us into trouble. I too am with you. - Hello? - Bagga speaking, Chawla. Hello. Meet me at the old factory, tomorrow at 10:00 am. - Listen? - Yes? If you make another mistake... I know. You'll cut my wife into pieces and feed it to the dogs. Forgive me. I won't do this mistake again. Bye. Stupid. Bagga said, we need to meet him at the old factory, tomorrow at 10:00 am. Hello? Why did you disconnect the call before I could finish? Disconnect the call again and I'll cut you into pieces. What? Now you will have to pay me double the money. 2 million instead of 1 million. What happened? We are getting 2 million from them. What will we be left with if we give them all of it? A rattle? You are a fool. You should have thought about it. He said 2 million and you couldn't say no? You should have bargained a little. It's not like I am buying a dress that I'd bargain. We are fake goons. He is a real goon. I am asking what we will get out of this? Forget that, I am wondering how will I escape Shamsher? Hey! We are stupid. Why? We too should raise the ransom like he did. What say? We should ask for 2.9 million. - Damn it! - No! He doubled it, so we too shall double it and ask for 4 million. "Gol Gappe! Gol Gappe! " "Gol, Gol, Gol!" Hello? Bagga, the goon, speaking. Yes? You betrayed us. It is not my fault. I don't know who informed the police. We had to face trouble because of you. Get this straight. Okay. If you love your wife, then this time you will have to give me 4 million instead of 2 million. That's too much. Fine, then let's settle at 3.9 million? 4 million! Be a goon! 4 million and not a penny less! Where do I need to come? At Nathu Halwai's shop. Don't give him our address. Behave like a goon. Behave like a goon! Not here, you stupid! Meet me at the old factory at sharp 10:00 am! Bagga is coming at 10! Not at 10:00 am! Note down the time. Meet me at sharp 8:45 am! Okay. One more thing, kiddo. If you act smart or inform the police, I'll cut your dogs into pieces and feed it to your wife! Hail Goddess Bhavani! Hail Goddess Bhavani! Son? What did he say? He said we will have to pay for calling the police. We will have to give them 6 million instead of 4 million. 6 million? They keep increasing the ransom. Fine, I'll take 4 million and go. I'll try and request them. They might agree. Okay. That is better. Mummy, what if they don't let her go? It's not we can take the money with us when we die. Give them the money. Sweety is our only daughter. Everything we have anyway belongs to her. What do you say, Daddy? Should I try with 4 million rupees? No, I'll arrange for another 2 million. Yes. Sir, I don't understand one thing. Dr. Chawla is a friend of yours. Then why isn't he seeking our help? It's obvious, Sukhchan. Kidnappers scare people so badly that they don't seek help even if they want to. We will have to be on our toes this time and make sure that the kidnappers don't escape. Okay, sir. Keep your head low. Police should think that it's me. Daddy, take him along and divert police's attention. I'll go and get Sweety from the old factory. - Okay. No. I am feeling scared. Should I slap you? You didn't feel scared while informing the police? My daughter's life is in danger because of you. Get in the car. Let's go. He is feeling scared now. - Sir... sir I am feeling scared. - Get in. I am feeling scared, sir. Bye, Daddy. We won't take any risk this time. We barely escaped the last time. Yes. We won't go empty handed this time. Should we take 2 kilos of mangoes with us? If we need to take something along then why not take Barfi from our shop? We have a lot of left. I am talking about weapons! Well done, Tipu Sultan. The weapon you used to cut onions with is also blunt. He wants to take weapons with him. Then let's take broomsticks with us. We are not going to clean Chawla's house. We are going to collect the ransom from him. Fine, first tell me, what should we wear this time? I had worn an Achkan at a wedding. It suits me well. We are not going for Dr. Chawla's wedding. We are going to collect ransom money from him. Tell me what disguise we should take today. I'll take care of that. How? "Gol, Gol, Gol!" Come in. Come in. Come in. The person these things belong to didn't pay me any rent. So, I didn't give him his things back. Today, these things will help us. This should work. You want to wear a sari? You will lose both this sari and your honor if the cops chase you. Let's wear this. Punditji? This is good. Hey! - This won't... - No, no, no. This crown belongs to Lord Rama. We cannot do shady business while wearing it. It is a sin. Hail Lord Rama. How about this? That's too many people. He wants only one person there. Take it off. I don't get it! Then what will we wear? We... will... wear that! We will wear that! "Gol, Gol, Gol!" We won't spare you anymore! - We will break bones! - Stop! We have reached. We have reached the enemy's house. Everyone get ready! Friends! Brothers! Relatives! And cooks! We are here to collect the money and we will only return after taking it. My sister is getting married in the morning. That cheater still hasn't given me my money back. Brothers, first things first, we will all keep our voices down. Got it? He will run away if he hears us coming. So, no one will make any noise. - What will not make any? - Noise! No! Shh! Cooks, you have to go after Pali and not sweets! - Who will you go after? - Pali! Quiet! Fine. I will go inside now. Let's go. Wait. Blessed are those...! - Who take the name of Lord! - Shh! Keep it down. He is here with a tractor and trolley full of people. He is big plans. For? For Pali! What do you mean? Your uncle is here with his wedding party. Ask them to go back. None of us wants to marry him. This is not the time to joke, Punditji. His uncle Shamsher is here with the entire village. What do I do now? What can we do? Let me think. Think. Hello? We have been deceived, sir. Dr. Chawla sent his servant in the car instead of him. - What? - Yes, sir. Find out from the servant where Dr. Chawla is. Okay, sir. Pali, where are you? - Give us our money back! - Pali? Come on out! Where are you? Give us our money back! Where are you, Pali? Pali! Where are you hiding? Come on out! Are you his uncle? I am not his uncle. I am his friend. You are his friend? Then give us our money back. I too have to take money from him. He doesn't pay back. He refused to pay it. He didn't refuse. He will pay it back. Why will you pay me back? He means when we get our money, we will make sure you get yours as well. - He won't pay it back, that rascal. - Brother! Don't cuss. He isn't cursing you. He is cussing Pali, the dog! That dog! Wait, wait, wait. - Brother? - Wait, let me talk. Tell me something, why are you dressed up like this? Why are you wearing a disguise? To make sure you don't recognize us. What do you mean? He means that, Pali, that dog doesn't run away after seeing. Brother! Brother! Wait, he owes them money too. Let's get together with them and look for Pali. Right! You do one thing, look for him inside. We'll go and look for Pali outside. Okay? - Let's go, you dog! - Let's look for Pali inside. Pali! Pali! Pali! Come out from wherever you are hiding and pay us! Are you going to come out or not? - Brother? - Shh! Keep it down. You will make him run away. He ran away, Brother. That tall guy was Pali. Couldn't you tell me any sooner? I kept saying "Brother, Brother!" You should have said "Pali, Pali" instead. Let's go before he runs away. He didn't pay me today either. He fooled me again. He ran away! I won't spare him today! No matter where he goes! - Follow him! - Go! Go straight away! Let's go! Wait, Pali, I am coming to take my money! Give me the bag. Where is my wife? Don't ask too many questions. The matter got escalated because of your wife. - Give us the money. - How can I trust you guys? This world works on trust. When we kidnapped your wife, we trusted you to pay. Give it here. Can I come with you, Mr. Bagga? Hey! Don't get too friendly with Bagga, the goon, otherwise I'll fry you like fritters in boiling hot oil. Zip it. Keep quiet and sit here. Just like beggars wait outside a temple. Let's go. - Keep quiet and stand here. - Please hurry back. "Oh, Jaggi!" Open the bag, Pali. Spilt it into two. - Hurry up. - Open it. - Take this. - Take it. Here. Make sure there are no torn notes in there. Here. We have spilt it into two bags. You have 2 million and I have 2 million. You have 2 million. He has 2 million. What did I get? - A rattle? - Mr. Nathu! We need to give half the money to Bagga, don't we! - I see. - Yes. Be careful, Jagga. If Bagga kidnaps you as well, we don't have money to pay the ransom. - We will have to sell a kidney. - We won't have to sell a kidney. We have this. I'll rather sell your kidney than part with it. Hello? Take care of the money. Don't start counting them here. I'll go and get Chawla's wife. Okay. Okay. Huh? "Oh, Jaggi!" I found one. The other two too must be around. So you are finally here, Chawla? Yes, I am Chawla. Why are you wearing a disguise? So that no one recognizes me. Did you bring the money? Yes. Get her. Look at that. They don't have money to give me, but they have money to buy a woman. Just order us. We will kidnap her. Wait! Be patient. Wait! Untie her mouth. Step aside! He is not my husband! Get him! He is a cop! Hurry up! He will run away! Stop or I'll shoot you! Stop or I'll shoot! Shots fired! I hope Jagga is not hurt. Mr. Bagga! Drop your gun! Gun! Mr. Bagga! Mr. Bagga, let it go! - Let it go! - Let me go! Jagga! Help! Jagga! Help! Let me go! Mr. Bagga, let go of the gun! No! Punditji! Help! Let me go! Don't shoot! Mr. Bagga, I apologize! Please, my darling brother! Mr. Bagga, drop your gun! Don't shoot! Even your threat is enough to kill me. Mr. Bagga, drop the gun! Move aside! "Gol Gappe! Gol Gappe!" "Gol, Gol, Gol!" "Gol Gappe! Gol Gappe! Gol Gappe!" "Gol Gappe! Gol Gappe! Gol, Gol, Gol!" Mr. Bagga, please forgive me! - Please forgive me! - You! Get them! No one can lay their hands on Pali, except me. - I am coming! - Wait. Wait. Let's go from there! From there? Let's go! - You...! - Hey! - Blessed are those... - who take the name of Lord! Run! - Come on! - Run! How dare you touch my friend! Pali! Your friend Shamsher is here! Shamsher, you? There is a lot of danger out here. Leave right away. I'll give you your money back. I don't want my money. I want my friend. Money has no value in front of my friend. Well said! Can you repeat that? I don't want my money. I want my friend. Money has no value in front of my friend. Oh Shamsher! My brother! Now watch what your friend does for you! How dare you hurt my friend! Come on! Come on! Come on! Get down! Get down! Get down! I won't! Do as you please! - He went that way! - Where did he go? "Oh, Jaggi!" Sorry, sorry. Punditji, whose side are you on? I am on your side, son. Then why did you hit me? Good thing I didn't break your skull open. You didn't break my skull open, but you could've put a hole in my chest What are you saying! Catch this! Not me! Catch this! I am coming up there. I am coming! I am coming! I got him. Get him down. Lift me up! Hold my hands, not my legs! Save my honor! Stop laughing or I will shoot you! My pants! Mummy! Help! "Gol Gappe! Gol Gappe! Gol Gappe!" "Gol Gappe!" Punditji, it's you? Don't make me hit you. Let's go. "Gol, Gol, Gol!" It's okay, it's okay. Get up. Get up. Get up. Get up. - Punditji! - Hey! I just want to help you, son. - You want to help me? - Yes. Then don't do anything. Why shouldn't I do anything? Then you won't give me my share. I will do something or the other for sure. - You want to do something? - Yes. - Then follow me. - Okay. Jaggi! Mr. Nathu! I got their bag as well! Let's go break their legs! Don't make me break your jaw. If fools grew horns he would have plenty of them. Listen to me. We have the women we came here to save? - Yes. - We have our bag? - Yes. - We have their bag as well? - Yes. - Then why go in there? - Let's go! - No, no, no. It is cheating to take their bag with us. Punditji, it's not like you are getting poor girls married. They too are goons. Let's go. Let's get out of here. Mr. Nathu, don't listen to him. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. How are you hurt my friend! How dare you! No one should even think about running away. Arrest them. Where's the other bag? Over here. Give it here. I'll take care of the money. You take her to her husband. No! You take her to her husband. I'll take care of the money. Give them here. Push the wedding car, Brother-in-law. Let's go. Don't worry, Sister. I'll untie your hands once I reach there. Brother-in-law must be waiting for you. Sweety! Sweety! - Are you alright? - Yes, I am fine. Where's Mr. Bagga? He is gone to kidnap someone else's wife. - We are busy. - Okay. What kind of a knot is this? - Let me open this one as well. - Yes. Sweety, my child? - Sweety? - My child? - Are you alright? - Mummy! Thank God, my daughter is alright. We were worried about you, dear. Where is he? Mr. Nathu? We did it! We got the money! We are rich! Why so sad, Punditji? We are rich, Punditji! Where are the bags, Punditji? Where are the bags, Punditji? Tell us! Where are the bags? Over there. Huh? Don't worry. We will show you the bags and the police station. Call Dr. Chawla. Okay, sir. Remove your masks. Take them off. Come here. We got the culprits. You got your money back. Here's your 4 million rupees. 4 million? We gave them 6 million. Yes. Tell me where the balance 2 million rupees? Sir, we had asked for 4 million and these bags contain that. I swear, we didn't even take money for tea from in there. No, you had asked for 6 million and we gave you 6 million. - Yes. - Daddy, we got Sweety back safe and sound. Don't bother about a million or two. Let's go. Okay, bye. No son, we should know where that 2 million went. - Yes. 'How many times have I told you,' 'ask for another 2 million from daddy.' Sweety, are you doubting me? No. Oh, thank you. No, I am sure it's you. Sweety? I had no other option. You know how important it is for me to have my own clinic. He was stealing from his own wife? Mr. Chawla, you can solve that matter at home. - Take them away! - Wait! Daddy, they aren't the real kidnappers. They saved my life. What are you saying? - Yes, we are helpless people. - Yes. Why else would anyone do this? Yes, Daddy. Your daughter wouldn't have been here if not for them. Please don't get them arrested. Hmm. We got our daughter back, Inspector. We don't want to file any complaint. You should let them go. Fine. If you don't want to file a complaint against them, then we don't have any personal enmity with them either. But be careful next time. - Yes. - Let's go, boys. Thank you, sir. Bye. Sorry, sir. We made a mistake. Please forgive us. Okay, bye. Let's go. Wait a minute. Stop. Mr. Chadha, we would have managed, even if the kidnappers had taken all the money, right? They need our help. You are right. Yes. Nothing is more important to us than our daughter. Let's help them out. - Wait. - Give it another thought, Daddy. I have decided, son. Don't interfere. Take this. You can keep this. Take it. It's a small thank you. Take it. Let's go. Let's go. - Let's go. - Come, my child. Come, my child. Look how generous he is. He is not generous. He took the other bag with him. Thank God we didn't get arrested. And we got more money than needed. Right? "Gol Gappe! Gol Gappe! Gol Gappe!" "Gol Gappe! Gol Gappe!" "Gol, Gol, Gol!"
