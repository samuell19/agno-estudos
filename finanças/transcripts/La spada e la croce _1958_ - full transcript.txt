Listen to me, I have news of great importance! What is it?. -The Emperor Tiberius has sent a special emissary to Judea. He is landing this very moment on some secret coast. Why such secrecy?, why did he not land at Caesarea?. That's a decision I believe did not come from the Roman emperor, rather it's a political move conceived by Pontius Pilate. What do you mean?. -It's simple, the arrival of the special emissary from the emperor in such a critical moment as the present can only mean that Pilate's methods of governing are not pleasing to Rome. And according to you, the Roman governor is trying to hide his weakness?. Certainly. Pilate is weak, but he is intelligent. He knows the advantages the Sanhedrin and King Herod will have in dealing with the new envoy. Doesn't Caesarea have a port?. What is Pontius Pilate afraid of, having us land in a place like this?. I am only a soldier Gaius Marcellus. It is my duty to obey the orders given to me. A very convenient pretext, though not answering my question. You have been in Judea thirty years Claudius Africus. And no one should understand the reason behind certain orders better than you. No one should understand the reason for my silence better than you. (laughter) Alright, alright. An official landing in Caesarea might have given rise to rumours of disagreement between Rome and her prefect in Galilee. There are those who might have taken advantage of such a situation. Enough. Give the order to go ashore. During our journey you can tell me more fully about these mysterious precautions. Hey, hurry up down there!. In Rome there's much talk of a certain Barabbas. What do they think of him here?. Is he the liberator he pretends to be or just a common thief?. He calls himself the liberator, but I think you will find that nothing here is quite what it appears to be. You're something of a philosopher. -Just a soldier. Perhaps a tired soldier. Well, as an old soldier have you anything you could suggest?. I would suggest that you investigate a man who calls himself Jesus of Nazareth. How many men does he command?. -None, he is a rabbi. A preacher? Do you suggest I have something to fear from a mere religious fanatic?. -Perhaps not. Thirty years in Judea may have warped my judgment. There they are Barabbas. Now we can seize the tribute to Caesar. Eight cases of silver and gold. How do you know?. -If you had my sources of information you'd be Barabbas. Let go of this horse. Let go!. Stay back!. Leave me alone!. -Let go of my mistress!. How many cases?. -Seven. Well there ought to be one more. Go and find it. If it's not found you'll pay with your head. Here it is Barabbas, we found it. - (laughter) I told you there were eight. Put it with the others. Hurry. This money is the taxes of your countrymen Barabbas, don't take it, they'll only have to pay again!. Let him go. I'll take care of him. Where are you going?. Come on back here!. No, don't kill me Barabbas!. -This will teach you. So this is Barabbas. Is this how you free the kingdom of Judea?. Robbing caravans and attacking your own people?. Mary Magdalene, Hanan's mistress. You knew I was in this caravan, how did you know?. The great fame of your beauty is not exaggerated. And how did you know which caravans to attack, is Hanan your informant?. (laughter) Hanan?. Do you think it likely that I would be on friendly terms with the aristocratic nephew of the high priest?. So it is Hanan. Well, now you're under my protection. You should be grateful to me you are still alive. Barabbas!. -Where did he attack you?. On the hills, by the dry river. The caravan from Damascus.. they robbed the tribute.. for Caesar. How far is it from here?. -We can get there before dawn. Have a taste of this wine. It's really very good. Oh, maybe you'd like to taste it right from my lips. Pig. You call me a pig, you who sell yourself for a bag of gold. Ah, you choose well. You have eyes only for the rich. I am rich!. And I can afford to pay you if I wish. But why should I pay you?. You're my prisoner. If you won't come to me for love, I'll take you by force. How about it?. Barabbas, Roman soldiers!. Forward, kill them!. Surrender Barabbas. -To Romans, never!. Get away Barabbas. Kill him!. Follow me!. We will meet again Barabbas!. -Find me in Jerusalem!. Who are you? What are you doing here?. I was part of the caravan Barabbas attacked. What is your name?. -They call me Mary, I'm from Jerusalem. That's a bad wound. I'll bandage your arm. What is that you're putting on?. -Herbs. Caustic oils, something we natives use to help the healing. You are very beautiful. Familiarity with Jews is not allowed Centurion. You have laws that say so. It may be against nature, but it is the law. It's a stupid law. How can a law of the great Caesar be stupid?. You hold it against me then, that I'm a Roman. Of course not. You hold it against me that I'm a Jewess?. -Nonsense. I gave up the idea of superiority of one people over another many years ago. In fact, it was a man from your country who convinced me. A very clever, cultivated man. His name was Hanan. He's the nephew of the high priest. Have you heard of him?. -There are many nephews in Israel. If I ever come to Jerusalem, will you be easy to find?. Perhaps. What would you think of me if I chose to violate one of our antiquated laws?. I would think of you as a man. You must rest now. Your soldiers would be obliged to kill me if you don't get well. -I wouldn't want that. I'll be back tomorrow. You fool. You should not be seen here. Are you afraid the Romans will find out we're friends?. Friends?. -Well, we have an agreement. You might ask me why I risk my neck to come here to see you. Why did you?. That caravan I attacked is in Roman hands, they caught us completely by surprise. Many of my best men were killed. You let a hundred thousand coins slip through your hands?. Are you more interested in the money than Mary of Magdalene?. Mary?. -Yes, she was in the caravan too. She also is in Roman hands, and she knows of our connection. How could she now?. She's a shrewd woman. For a price she'll talk to the Romans. She wouldn't. Of course. I'm forgetting about your irresistible charm. How could she possibly betray you?. However at the moment she's in the desert with the Roman centurion Gaius Marcellus. -Gaius Marcellus?. You know him?. Well then you know what he's like. You see Mary has a weakness common to courtesans: for men. And in the case of this one, I think she could even fall in love with him. Get out. I'm going. But, if Mary or anyone else betrays... -Get out!. We were supposed to be in Caesarea three days ago. The men are beginning to grumble. What goes on in there does not set a good example for the legionnaires. Hold your tongue. Gaius has forgotten the orders of the emperor. I told you to hold your tongue. What's troubling you?. I was thinking of a girl. Her name was Judith. She died at seventeen. Very sad. -Oh but, she deserved to die. How was that?. -She fell in love, that was her crime. She wasn't sure whether it was the uniform of a young legionnaire, or if it was a true love.. How could she know anyway at seventeen?. Her parents tried to keep them apart. But, they met once more promising eachother it would be for the last time. That night, in the square before the temple... she was stoned to death. The soldier was dishonoured, sent away. She was a jewess, he was a Roman?. Yes. Does this disturb you, Mary?. Marcus!. Why was that signal blown?. -I've given orders to break camp. Why, what's happened?. -The jewess has gone. Gone?. You let her go!?. -I helped her go. You fool, this is insubordination. Marcus, you don't understand. -Yes, you love her. This my good friend is most unfortunate. You know your duty as well as I. You there, get the horses ready. We're leaving at once. Martha!. Lazarus!. Where are you?. Mary, I'm glad you've come back. -Lazarus. I am so glad to be home. -We were terribly worried, they told us the caravan you were travelling with was attacked. Who told you?. -I did. Oh, how did you know?. -I would like to speak to you alone. How did you know? Barabbas?. I only hope the Romans don't come to the same conclusion. You were afraid I might go to the Romans, and lose you Hanan?. Oh and, your dear friend Barabbas tried to seduce me. I have great faith in your discretion. I imagine you were most gracious to the Romans. I'm tired. Come back here. I am not your slave. Remember that. I'll do as I please. I am going to Caesarea for a few days. When I return let us give a banquet to celebrate your homecoming. As you wish, but not here. My sister and brother don't approve, you know that. This is our house. This is where we shall receive our guests. I have read Rome's criticism of my administration in Judea. In effect, Caesar considers me a failure. The charge I must admit, is regrettably true. I'm sure you exaggerate the intent of the report. My wife Claudia agrees with it. The language is a little more diplomatic perhaps, but the meaning is the same. Rome is well aware of your achievements as an administrator in Spain, Alexandria and elsewhere. Yes of course, but that was Spain and Alexandria, as you say. But this is Judea, centurion. It is an improbable land, defying the reason of a practical man. That is to say myself. Are you saying that we who have conquered the world cannot manage these few acres of desert?. -I am suggesting that I do not have the solution, but I am always ready to accept one. The military's prepared to restore law and order as the first step. I approve, continue. -We will wipe out the bandits. Restore communications. -For my part I will give you every sort of cooperation within the limits of my power. Perhaps you can tell me why this land is so difficult to administrate. In a word, they want their freedom. Can't they see the benefits of Roman rule?. Believe it or not but they can't. What makes it more complex is that King Herod wants freedom on his terms. The Sanhedrin will have it on its terms. Then there are hosts of demagogs, rabbis and whatnot, who exhaust the people on their terms. Is this Jesus of Nazareth among the latter?. He is one of the newer rabbis, a radical from Galilee. Those who have heard him have found him rather convincing. Why are they shouting?. What are they doing?. They're trying to pull down the Roman eagle!. They object to the emblem of Rome set up before their synagogue. Away with the Roman emperors!. Is the eagle an insult to their God?. -Perhaps. But remember, here Caesar is preeminent. The emblem was placed there to prove it. This demonstration is in your honour Gaius Marcellus. This must be suppressed. -If you would like to try. With your permission. This is holy ground. This effigy is a grievous insult to our Lord. Tear it down!. Thus the emperors will be cast into hell by the Lord, the God of Israel. Down with the enemies of the Lord!. The Roman oppressors have taxed our people, they despise our religion!. Watch the eagle crumble into dust!. Watch ye people of Zion!. Hanan, you here?. I came to Caesarea for a few hours only. May I hope for an audience with you?. Audience? why all this ceremony?. We will be friends as we are in Rome. Here you are a Roman giving orders, I as a jew must obey. But since you consider us to be friends, let me give you my opinion of what has been happening. It was a peaceful demonstration. Why did your soldiers intervene?. -They desecrated the emblem of Rome. Placing an emblem of Rome in front of a synagogue was a provocation. You can make amends to some extent by freeing those taken prisoner. We cannot afford to display weakness at this point. I trust in your good judgment, and our friendship. You there, little boy. Come forward. You are only a child. How did you get involved with these rioters?. Answer me. Well young man, what have you to say for yourself?. I brought him here!. It is I who should be punished. But mark my words, Pilate. A great revenge is at hand. He who shall free the people of Israel is already among us. Soon the Roman standards will be swept away from the land of Judea. The penalty for this lack of respect, will be one hundred lashes. Take him away. He's only an old man who believes in his God, you can't punish him for that. I think that's good advice, accept it. Your purpose a little while ago was to deal firmly with this rabble. Now you are defending them?. You're the governor. The final decision is yours. Wait. Bring him back here. Tell me, who is he who is going to free the land of Israel?. It is he the holy books speak of. He has appeared amongst us. All Judea speaks of him and his miracles. The lame walk and the blind see. Rome will stop this fanatic. The spears of your soldiers will bend like reeds in the wind before him. And the bronze of their armor will be softer than wax. Enough!. Out with them!. Take them away. You saw them, you heard them. In your opinion what are these people?. Are they madmen, fanatics, or are they genuinely devout?. I don't know. I have no idea. You're a wise man centurion to admit that you do not know. Since John the Baptist, they've never been so excited about a new prophet. Would you care to investigate this further centurion?. It is my duty. But, what about the prisoners, what will you do with them?. I can't set them free. Roman authority has suffered a serious insult. But it is always so, they insult us, we put them in prison, and nothing changes. Why don't you exchange them... for the head of Barabbas?. Yes, that might be an excellent solution. Go to the Sanhedrin in Jerusalem to discuss the ransom for the prisoners. I'll join you in a few days in time for the passover. The Roman envoy is in Jerusalem to negotiate with the Sanhedrin. May the Lord give freedom to our brothers. What is this Roman's name?. -Gaius Marcellus. He came to Judea a few days ago. Later I shall go back to the temple and bring you news. Mary, is it he?. Yes. Remember that he is a Roman. -He saved my life. To me he's different from the others. -What are you going to do?. I don't know. I hope by now the good intentions of the governor Pontius Pilate are clear to you I hope also, that you are convinced of my good will. We thank the governor of Rome for his clemency which gives us hope that these violent times will finally come to an end. It is our wish and our promise, to hand Barabbas over to the justice of Rome as soon as possible. May the Lord grant us his help so that our imprisoned brothers may go free. Thank you Gaius, you gave me proof of your friendship by helping to free those Jewish prisoners. -Maybe I have stumbled into good fortune, but we are most interested in capturing Barabbas. Ah speaking of Barabbas. People say that when you encountered him, you also met a beautiful woman. -How do you know?. (laughter) Soldiers never keep a secret. What is her name?. -She calls herself Mary, she's from Jerusalem. Probably a courtesan, Jerusalem is full of them. If you knew this woman, you wouldn't say so. Sorry, I didn't know. Still I hope that love will not prevent you from having a little harmless fun. A courtesan friend of mine is giving a feast. I would like you to come. I can't refuse an invitation from an old friend, but I'm a Roman and your religion... -Ah cover your self with a cloak. The lady of the house won't mind. Let him go. Mary, I was afraid I would never find you again. Why did you run away?. -I thought it would be best for both of us. I believe we should stay apart. But today when I heard you were in Jerusalem, I realized I had to see you again, to explain. -You know that I love you. No, please. -What are you afraid of?. With me... You needn't ever be afraid of anything. Pilate is my friend, and the emperor Tiberius as well. I'm not afraid of them. -Then what are you afraid of?. Of myself. Of you. Me? Don't you know how much I love you?. Don't you understand I would do anything for you. You will come with me to Caesarea, to Rome. You will not end as Judith did. How good it would be if we could love one-another, always. There's nothing to prevent us. No... The time is not right. Gaius... You must promise me one thing. -Anything. I must leave you. Promise me you won't try to find me. When the time comes I'll find you I swear to you. -I can't promise that. But you must. Don't ask me anymore. Just know that I love you. And trust me. Welcome. Our friend is not yet ready to receive you. But I'm sure you will find her as lovely as your lady of mystery. Good evening. This is a friend of mine from Rome. -Welcome. Oh, here comes the slave. Bind him securely. Who is he?. A follower of the Nazarene. A man preaching goodness and purity. But what's he doing here?. I am curious to see if our hostess can convince him that sin is more amusing than virtue. That man is a holy man. You are committing a sacrilege. God will punish you Mary. -Stop it you're hurting me!. Why should God punish me?. He made me what I am. Don't blame the Lord for your sin, blame the devil and yourself. You have put your beauty at the service of Satan. Well if I am Satan's daughter, I might just as well live as a sinner. Give him up, Mary. Give up Hanan. -Oh Martha stop it!. Hanan's jealousy is growing day by day. You know it. Well, I'll do as he wishes, until the moment I can be free of him once and for all. Get out of here now, quickly. All of you. I have a reason now. Gaius Marcellus?. What's wrong?. Oh she's pleading for that holy man. She's afraid I might contaminate him. Mary. -Oh Martha please leave us alone. A present for you. It will make your dance very exciting. Why the mask, doesn't my face please you any longer?. You've a beautiful face, but wear the mask. So you won't distract me from the dance. Are you ill?. No... I am ready. What's wrong, is she ill?. -I don't know, I'll go see. I am sure it's nothing serious don't worry. In just a few moments friends, a new dancer will perform for you. Mary. Gaius. You're shameless. Your own religion forbids ludeness. Well now you know. Yes, I am Hanan's mistress!. Everybody knows it!. Please leave me alone. I didn't know she was the mystery woman. It was a waste of feeling. That's why you invited me. -Magdalene is my mistress. How was I to know she was the same woman?. The original deception was hers, it is part of her profession. Gaius, please. I'm Martha, Mary's sister. Please do not leave hating her. She is not bad believe me. There's good in her. Is that what the Nazarene teaches, bad is really good?. I forgive your blasphemy. It's best that you don't see Mary again. But please, try not to hate her. Magdalene... Magdalene... Mary!. The man from Galilee. He called me. -No, it was you who called Him. Why should a saint come to a sinner?. -Sinners need Him most. The lost sheep is dearer to Him than all the others. You've missed Ruth's dance. She failed too. The man must be made of stone. Come downstairs, everyone's expecting you. No don't touch me. Has seeing Gaius Marcellus upset you so much?. No one must ever touch me again. I swear it. No one. She is drunk. When she feels better, send her downstairs. I'm foolish to be afraid. It couldn't have been the man from Galilee. Someone has cast a spell over me. The Lord's messages are not witchcraft. Martha... Set the holy man free and make sure no one hurts him or harms him. Do you want to speak to him?. -No. Just send him away. Tomorrow, I'll go to the temple like everyone else. But you are mad. You know that you are not allowed in the temple. They'll stone you if they find out who you are. I must. I must pray to the God of Israel. Let's go back, Mary. Please. This one is finer. Isn't that Mary of Magdalene?. -It is Mary of Magdalene, look at her!. This is a sacrilege!. Lazarus said only you can save her. Please come. But why did she go to the temple?. -No one has been able to convince her that it is madness. But, I can't go in there. I am not of your faith. They will not say anything to a Roman. Only you can keep her from being stoned. Stoned?. You have offended the Lord. Do not hope to escape his wrath. The courtesan from Magdala!. -She has profaned the temple!. You shall atone for this with your death!. You have offended the Lord. Do not hope to escape his wrath!. There comes Jesus!. The man of miracles!. Jesus of Nazareth. The great healer. She is a sinful woman!. She has just profaned the temple!. According to the law of Moses she must be stoned. Tell us, what are we to do with her?. He, that is without sin amongst you... Let him cast the first stone. (laughter) I won again. Now I want to see five, come on, five's my lucky number. Wait, don't touch the dice. Alright it's your throw. Go on. Barabbas, there's someone to see you. He's waiting outside. Well, I thought you said we shouldn't be seen together. I've come to warn you that the Sanhedrin has promised to surrender you to the Romans. You must leave Jerusalem at once. You would like that wouldn't you. If you're anxious to be crucified stay. The mountains would be safer. Why are you so concerned about me?. -You're of no use to me in prison or dead. I value your life. You value more the money I bring you. -Naturally, you know very well that together we thrive on trouble. Yes, the more the waters are agitated, the richer we get. Good, you're learning. -Thanks friend for the warning but I'm staying here. I feel more secure. Do as you like. Forgive me but my mistress cannot receive you. I have orders not to let anyone in sir. -Let me pass. Mary is ill. -Don't tell me your sister is ill, I know her sickness. She's been infatuated with the Galilean ever since she met him at the temple. What is she going to do?, bury herself in her room?, read all of his preachings?!. -You are a Roman, you believe in other gods. -Never mind what I believe in!. The Nazarene can help Mary. If you love her, don't stand in her way. I also can help her!. Please wait, please. Gaius has come back again. He wants to see you. You have no reason to avoid him. He truly loves you and will understand everything. Why make him suffer?. -Don't you see Martha?. If I were to accept his love, he would suffer all the more. Why?.. Why do you struggle against your will?. Surely the Nazarene has taught you differently. The Nazarene!. Enough of this talk of the Nazarene!. You must not speak like that. He is the messiah. The messiah? Are you mad?! You and all the others who believe in him!? Why would the real messiah come to me?. He has forgiven you, Mary. His forgiveness means nothing to me. I know what I am,... ...and I know how I'll end. Is this how Romans force themselves on a woman?. Why didn't you bring your legions? Say something. You're the conqueror. Mary... One day you said you were afraid of me. Remember?. You were afraid that my love for you would die if I knew the truth. That has not happened. We'll go away together, we'll forget about this. No, I won't let you!. Please go away!. Mary... -You know who I really am!. Besides... You mean nothing to me. You never did. Don't go on!,... This is my love. Hanan pays for all this. I belong to him. You love him. You're an impossible woman, but then, I'm an impossible man. We belong together. Together... We'll invite our old friends. I'll buy you anything you want. I'll take you away from here. Your life is my life. You'll be yourself again. Why are you looking at me like that?. You know that Lazarus is ill, you can't leave him now. Yes I know, but I can't stay in Jerusalem any longer. I simply cannot. You are trying to escape. God is everywhere. You can't escape Him. He lives inside you. Alusha, Sarah and Miriam!. Quickly!. Pack everything. We're leaving. Silence. I have walked all day. I come from a distant village and I am old. I must see Jesus. -So must I. I have both my wife and son. -I have seen Him, I have heard him preach. I remember every word. Do not raise your voices. The Master is praying. He is very tired, you must be patient. Tomorrow he will listen to every one of you. Welcome Martha. Why are you so late. You should have come sooner. I will try to find some shelter for you and your brother. Thank you, Judas Iscariot. But I better take him home. -No, we must stay. Do you hear?. Tomorrow He will speak to us. We have time. Have faith in Him, and he will never forsake you. Martha is right Lazarus. Jesus never forsakes anyone. Not even the wicked. What are you doing here!? Do you want to have the Romans breathing down your necks?. Get away from here!. -We're not doing anything wrong, we're here to see Jesus. -The Galilean. Hah! The Galilean! The messiah of tramps and beggars!. I think we ought to elect him our chief! The kingdom of Judea will have its freedom on the day the fish learn to swim on dry land!. How would this messiah of yours stand up against this sword of mine?. Let's see if he has the power to stop this! Let's see which is stronger. Words or the force of arms!. He might distract the Romans' attention from you. Better him than you. You're right. You're fools!. You are all fools!. Following a greater fool than yourselves! Come on, make way!. We'd better go home Lazarus. No.. I must see Jesus. I say Hanan, where have you left your charming mistresses?. I have only one, here she is. The most fascinating of all. Is that Magdalene you were kissing, or her shadow?. What are you thinking about?. Where are you, Jerusalem, Caesarea or Rome?. What difference does it make where her mind is?. Her beauty is still here. With me. That's what counts. Don't touch me!. I've had enough!. Have you lost your senses?. -I want to return to Jerusalem. To whom? Do you think I don't know why you are acting like this?. Not all men are disposed to tolerate you as I do. Oh you've given me everything Hanan, except understanding. I am warning you. If you go now, I'll not take you back again. Even if you come begging at my feet. You needn't worry. I have had enough of begging. Go on with the dance!. Gaius Marcellus is in Caesarea. What do you want with him?. When will he return?. -I don't know. Even if I did, I'm not sure I would tell you. One moment. I know you love him. But surely you must realize the danger you risk?. Even if you don't fear for yourself, you must consider him. I know only too well what you say is true. Perhaps it would be better if you say nothing of my coming here. What's happened?. Speak up!. Is it Lazarus?. -He is.. dead. Stop!. Wait!. It's too late. He so wanted you to come. He hoped to see you for the last time. Martha... God has punished me. Punished me by taking Lazarus. You mustn't say that. -It's true!. If god had willed otherwise, Lazarus would still be with us. We all understand your grief, but no one can ever raise the dead. Why didn't you go to Jesus before it was too late?. Where was your faith?. You have called me, Mary Magdalene?. You have come. Lazarus is saved. Your faith has saved him. Lazarus... Lazarus... Come forth. Listen to me brothers, and remember my words. We are truly the elect, the people chosen by god. The kingdom of the Lord is at hand, as it is written by the prophets of old. It is He who we have awaited so long. Our bondage is at an end!. Praise the Lord of Israel!. The day of our deliverance is finally at hand!. He is truly the messiah!. Listen to my words brothers and praise the Lord!. What's happening? Seems everywhere people are gathering in the streets. There's much excitement about this Jesus of Nazareth. They're talking about his latest miracle. They say he has raised somebody from the dead!. (laughter) What foolishness. No, this time it's true. They even know his name. Lazarus of Magdala. What did you say his name was?. -Yes Lazarus, the brother of the jewess. Before the miracle she came to look for you. Why didn't you tell me immediately?. -At the time I thought best not to. But now I no longer know what is right and what is wrong. Where is Mary Magdalene?. -She's gone to see the Galilean. Where?. -At the house of Simon the Pharisee. Jesus is his guest. Gaius!. Look! Why does she humiliate herself in this way?. Is she now a slave?. -No, Mary loves Jesus. Oh, so that's the reason?. -Yes, but hers is not an earthly love. But what kind of love is it then?!. It is the love that comes from the soul, pure and everlasting. If you cannot understand it, at least respect it. Please, try to forgive her, and let her follow her own way. -If she prefers this love... Martha, I warn you for your own safety, and hers. There are many who believe this messiah to be an impostor. They will act accordingly. They've never acted this way, not even at the coronation of their King. They must be mad. -There must be something to this man or they wouldn't make such a fuss about him. Gaius.. If you wish to go I can control the situation. If there's a sign of rebellion, charge into the crowd. If the Galilean resists,don't spare him. -But they are only children and old people. I'm sure your informers have exaggerated the danger of this man. I didn't ask for your opinion. It is the custom in this country to make seditious utterances against Rome, as it is the custom to eat unleavened bread during the passover. These cries that have been heard may be no more important than that. Even so, you have seen the masses of people who are in movement. Only one small spark is needed to set them off. Excellency. Hanan has come as an emissary from the Sanhedrin, seeking an audience with you. He's accompanied by an emissary from King Herod. Have them enter. Claudia, I beg of you to keep your feelings under control. Remember that you are the wife of the governor of Judea. Yes.. The Sanhedrin wishes to express its... -Come to the point! There's no need for ceremony. What does the Sanhedrin want of me?. I have been instructed to inform you that the priests are ready to condemn Jesus of Nazareth, unmasking him in front of the people as a false prophet. They seek to know what you, as a representative of Rome intend to do. You know where I stand Hanan. I will not interfere with matters purely religious. But if this man is proved to be a rebel against Rome?. Then I shall be obliged to act. We have clear evidence that the Nazarene plots rebellion against the authority here. -Against Rome?. Yes, your excellency. Give me the proof. Your name?. -Ezra. Where you a follower of the Nazarene?. -I was. Why did you give it up?. -Because the followers planned to rebel. Against whom?. -Against the King, against the Sanhedrin and Rome. Come closer. Why are you in chains?. -I was misled. Have you been promised your freedom?. But you expect to obtain it?. -I hope that the King will be generous. Well then?. -There are others who will testify to the conspiracy against Rome. -Rome will do its part. Gaius Marcellus will do what is necessary. We all are ready to eliminate those who threaten the peace of Jerusalem and defy the power of Rome. Hanan... I have been told that the Galilean is hiding. Do you know where he is?. One of his disciples is ready to betray Him. It is just a question of money, as is everything. Twenty six, twenty seven, twenty eight, twenty nine, thirty. Where is he?. -Follow me. Why aren't you asleep?. I can't sleep. I'm afraid. Afraid? Even when we are so close to Him? -It's for him that I am afraid. I have such a feeling of dread. As though something was going to happen. I seem to hear the sound of footsteps. Many of them. It's the sound of marching. Marching... It's the soldiers. They're here. The soldiers are here!. Gaius, you can't arrest him!. He is innocent!. You've come back sooner than I expected. -Help me, Hanan. Help me. They've arrested Jesus. You could use your influence to save Him. The Galilean is in Roman hands, he is helpless. Hanan... You loved me once. Perhaps you still do. Everything could be as it was before. Only save Jesus. Save Him. What a fool you must think I am to accept such a proposition. Forget Jesus, He is doomed. -No he must be freed!, I must free Him. Even if I have to go to Barabbas. You are to take this to the centurion Gaius Marcellus. You here Mary Magdalene?. I am here to ask your help. -My help? Why not Hanan's, is he tired of you?. -I want you to go to the Antonium fortress and free Jesus. -Jesus, why, can't he free himself?. He's good at miracles isn't he?. Now I'm supposed to deliver the deliverer of the kingdom!. Here is everything that I have that is of value. Mmm, there is no limit to a woman's generosity. Magnificent. Then you will save Jesus?. -The messiah?. (laughter) The messiah!. Here is the real messiah of Israel!. This is the real power and strength with which David, Saul and Judith drove out the enemies of the Hebrews!. The Romans!. We are surrounded!. Cowards!. Would you rather die with an arrow in your back?! Defend yourselves!. Barabbas!. I am here!. So we meet again centurion!. -Surrender Barabbas!. Come and take me!. I want to see how a Roman fights!. Stop!. Now we have an old account to settle. Here, Gaius. Pilate wants you alive. This cave has always been safe. Who's betrayed me?. A friend of yours. Magdalene... I came here to find help to free Jesus. Now I don't know where to turn. Does he really mean that much to you?. -Gaius, I have loved you deeply. Had I met you before, perhaps my life would be different. But this love I feel for the Nazarene, surpasses any feeling I've ever felt. Your sister Martha tried to tell me, but I would not listen. Only when I took that man to prison, did I begin to understand. Gaius, Jesus doesn't deserve to die. He is innocent. Come, I will take you to Him. Why are you doing this?. -I don't know. I shall never know. Why does Herod wish that I alone should pass sentence?. The King has left the fate of Jesus in your hands, Excellency. You cannot condemn him. It would be a crime. He does not speak of violence. He commands the people to love, not to hate. He tells the humble, that they shall inherit the Earth. The poor? The humble? They shall inherit the Earth?. Rome will fall under the impact of that idea. It is an idea that will never lead to peace It will breed irresistible violence. Love is violence? Is peace violence? No, peace is peace. And if the consequence is that Rome should fall down, then let Rome crumble to the dust. Must I be a traitor to save your god?. We can trust Him, Master. He has faith in You. He will help you to escape. No, Mary. My destiny has already been decided by my father. That which is writ, must be fulfilled. It is unjust that you should die for our sins. Do not condemn, Mary. Each man does what he thinks is right. We must forgive... Forgive, and love our neighbour. Only so will you live in the peace of the Lord. You have done everything in your power to save Him Mary. There's nothing more... You can't destroy yourself to keep a memory alive. I can't give up my faith, even for you. I will carry the word of Jesus to those who have not heard it. Jesus will be forgotten after his death. No... It is by his death he will begin to live. His faith will live forever and ever... Fansubbed by Nefasto @ Cinemageddon. Friday, September 23, 2011.
