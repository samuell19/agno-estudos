That was Foreigner with "Double Vision," this is WBRE, the Roar. Big Bear's home for classic rock. I'm Midday Mike and at the top of the hour, we're giving away two free lift tickets and ski packages. Yeah, The Roar is, uh, doing our part to help keep this little mountain town alive. We may be locked down, but the slopes are open. We're on life support up here, folks. So, call in, give me the phrase that pays, and you and one lucky friend could be shredding the gnarly powder. And even if you don't win, come on up to the mountains, safely, get some fresh air, spend some money at one of the few remaining restaurants or gift shops and pay us a visit before they shut us down for good. In the meantime, David Bowie wants to take a trip on... a Gemini starship. Aw! Clean bill of health. Does that mean I can take this off? You're clean. Fuck, they really poked my brain. - But this is so worth it! - It's worth it. It's worth it. Oh, it's nice to see you! You guys, sorry to bust this up, but I've got some bad news. But, uh... someone's gonna have to be the middle spoon! Let's do this! Oh, my God, are you real? Can I... Is it okay... Come here. Yes, oh my God, buddy! Hey! It's been like what? Ten years? I mean, it feels like ten minutes, but it's been like ten years. This is insane. I mean, really though, guys? Is this real life? Are we on Zoom? Dude, I don't even wanna hear it. Okay? No Zoom, no Internet, no nothing. Just nature. Breathe it in! Whoo! Oh, my gosh, guys. I'm so happy we're here. Even if it is with you jerkoffs. Aw, you're so sweet. - I'm gonna go grab my shit. - All right, see you guys. Grab your shit. I'll help you. I brought all the groceries. Whoo! I'm hungry. - You get the chewy bars? - Yes. Is there a coffee machine here? Yeah, we got one. As long as you have marshmallows. - Yes. Of course. You know how Mike likes his marshmallows. Would you like some tea? Some tea? Would I like some tea? No, I'm okay, thank you. - Hmm. - Hmm. - Well, this is fine. - I know. This is, like, so different from my quarantine life. I'm just, like... Have you guys ever skied before? Are we gonna have bears at this lake? - Like? - Like karaoke, or like dancing or the movies? - Shall we dance? - Shall... shall we... Oh no. Oh, oh, okay. Guys, it seems like there's a lot more to do in this town during the summer, like jet ski, wave running, fishing, sailing. Mountain biking. All they have in the winter is skiing. - Okay, what type of dance? - Are you leading? Oh yes, my mom made me do the ballroom dancing. Okay, show me the ballroom dancing. Do you out, and that. Like this. They have a pirate ship here. Where do you get a pirate? Okay, how about salsa? No, no, I don't do salsa. - You can do salsa. - I don't! Just shake your hips. Yep, you have hips. I don't have like, it's like a... it's like that, isn't it? Like. Back and oh, oh. Ooh, ooh, ooh! Guys, got the fire going. This is weird. Like, what are we doing? I mean, it's like we used to do this all the time, but I don't know how to do it anymore. You know, my apartment was actually closing in on me, like, I was getting so claustrophobic. I am so happy to be out of L.A. I know, like, if I jerk off one more time, they'll put me in the Guinness book... Okay, all right. Relax, okay? Chill. I deserve some recognition. There's a lady present. Okay? - Thank you. - It's been a lonely few months. No, I get that. But you were hanging out with Lisa, right? - What? - Yeah. Who's Lisa? L-I... - It's Jill. - Yeah, that's I... Okay. - Yeah. - Who's Jill? J-I-L-L. Jill. I got excited there for a minute. I was like, "Did I black something out?" - You had Jill. - Like, who's Lisa? I would love to meet Lisa. - Keep looking. - Or anybody for that matter. You'll find your Lisa. Do you have an Only Fans? No. But if you had an Only Fans, I'd support you. Maybe we should start one up. - Thanks, man. - I have an Only Fans. - What? - Yeah, but just for my feet. Hit me with that link, yo! I thought I saw that. I thought I recognized those feet. They're beautiful. Guys, do you know that I voted for the first time? - Oh! - What? I know, random. But I just wanted share. - Welcome to the club. - Thank you. Did you vote for the turd sandwich or the shit fiesta? I actually don't remember. If you voted for Kanye, I swear to God... I'm actually really excited about the jury duty. - What? - Yeah! That's not something to be excited about. Do you have that in the Philippines? After being in quarantine for that long. I want to be in a room full of strangers! Okay. Fair. I could see that. You're not going to like it. No, it's not something to be excited about. But something you get out of. - Yeah, - Not get into. I've made every excuse in the book to get out of it. I'm actually surprised that Katie even let you come. Yeah, I thought you were going to have to skip out like a little bitch. Uh, we're actually not together anymore. - What? - Oh, fuck. What happened? Quarantine was rough. You know, just wasn't meant to be. Shit. So, you think I can get a refund on that wedding gift? Yeah, I'll see what I can do. All right. Do you want any of this? Yeah, I smoke. Pass that shit, yo. - He likes it. - No matter how high or fucked up you guys get tonight, I'm dragging your asses out for a hike in the morning. - Let's go right now. I'm ready. - I'm game. He's the one you need to worry about. I've been hiking. I've been to Runyon. You took dates to Runyon. That's what you do. Well, yeah. You know, I used to in my former life. Do you have hiking shoes? I've got shoes that I can hike in. Did you bring those rock shoes to hike in? Dwayne The Rock Johnson made a line of shoes. - I like it. - I knew it. I knew it was that. Go into the snow with those shoes. - I can do whatever I want. - Let him learn. Let him learn. The Rock makes a quality product. And I... If you slip, my trip will be made. - Fuck you. - I really missed you guys. We missed you too. - To being together. - Cheers. - Missed you guys. - Love you guys. It's hike o'clock. What's up? Good morning, Mr. Sunshine. Good morning, sir. All right. I got all my supplies, water, granola bars. What's this gonna be, like, a half hour, 45 minutes? Wow. Look at you. You want to be our Sherpa? You want me to grab you a tall stick outside? - Oh, I'd love one. - Hey, buddy, we're in Big Bear. Not Nepal, okay? You know, it's just such a joy to be hung over with other people and not alone, sad in my apartment. Well, drink lots of water. Keep hydrated. I brought water. - It's gonna be a long hike. - I just told you that. God. It's a gorgeous day. I'm so happy we're here and not in L.A. Yeah, it's all right. Really? Can't you feel that crisp air? Seriously, when's the last time you guys were like actually outdoors? You guys wanna go back in any time soon or? Oh, really? Constantly complaining. Come on. - I mean, it's just we've been out here for, - like, 20 minutes. - Can we enjoy this? All right. It is kind of nice. See, we told you, it's nice. I understand why people become tree huggers now. You have hugged every tree that we walked by. Give it a rest. Hey! Guys, wait up. It's not much farther, Mike. Keep it up. I'm having flashbacks to my youth. Should've worked out more in your youth. Okay, it's a little... it's a little steep. Everyone be careful. Do you need help, Sarah? No, I'm good. Thank you. I feel like I'm gonna slip on a fucking pinecone. You got it, back there? Yeah, I'm fine. Thank you. I'm good. I'm kind of already dreading, like, this trip being over. - Seriously. - This is so nice. I just think I'm more of an indoorsman. Hey, what's your take on Bigfoot, Michael? - Bigfoot? - Yeah. Come on. Why are you lagging? Keep up. - What's your take? - Is that your... Is it your backpack? None of you have stuff. Why do you have so much shit? I've brought supplies. Yeah, you volunteered to bring everything. Boy Scouts are always prepared. Don't complain after you volunteer for something. I didn't get very far in the Boy Scouts, but I did learn to pack stuff. I call first shower. There better still be hot water. That's totally fine with me because you need it the most. Oh, hilarious. - Ew! - Oh, what is that? Coyote shit? Ew, I just got these. That is not coyote shit. Hey, calm down. Stop squishing them. It's like an insect nest or something, I don't know. I've never seen an insect that's like that. Yeah, me either. Let me see. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! What are you doing? - Don't touch it. - Hey, relax, relax, okay? What the fuck could it be? Something you don't want to mess with. Yeah, because you know so much about the great outdoors, right? - Expert. - If that's an insect nest, just don't touch it. Danny, I said... I said don't touch it. Jesus! I didn't touch it. Here, wrap it with this. It's like it reached out and stung me or something. Well, great. You know what? That's our cue to just go back. You just mess with someone's art installation. Seriously, dude, you wanna go find some poison ivy to roll around in? Oh God, you know, you idiot. If this is a horror movie, you're dying first. Oh, I'm gonna touch it! Idiot. Come on, guys. Danny, come on. What did you ever see in Mark? First of all, he was really funny. Yeah, in a fucking not funny way. I think he was funny. Yeah! He was funny? Like Nick Jonas hosting SNL's funny. Which, by the way, it wasn't. It's like Nick Jonas being cast in Jumanji 2. - He was in Jumanji? - He was. That movie is much better than it has any right to be. I'm just saying. - I love The Rock. - I guess, like, if you're that cute, you don't need to... Okay! All right, Jesus. First of all, it's none of your business who I date. Second of all, what is this? - Sassy! - You have so much baggage. You have so much baggage. - So much baggage. - Mark baggage, Nick Jonas. - Who's next? - Well... - Give me my comics. - Should I burn them? - No! Do not burn those! - To keep warm? Don't burn my shit. - What did you bring? - I brought stuff. Useful... well, first aid kit. - Okay, that's useful. - Yes, thank you. I've been camping before. I grew up camping. - You know this. - What is this? That is my camping knife. It's for cutting wood and stuff. Ooh! Dude! What are you... Don't just... You can't just... What you doing? Stop that. - That is sharp. - It is sharp. You keep that because you're... clearly very skilled with a blade. - Really? - Yeah. I mean, you never know when you might need it. I'm so cold. Yeah, well, that's because you don't have the blanket on. - Silly. - Help! What the fuck was that? Help! Help! There's a crazy dude out there. - I'll scare him off. - No, dude, don't. It's fine, it's fine. Michael, I don't think that's a good idea. - I do this all the time. - Michael, don't! Michael. Hey! Whoa. Dude, you okay? Sarah, call 9-1-1, this guy needs help. Sir, we... What the... Please. - Just help me. - Hey, stay down there, man. Just try to describe what's happened. There's a stranger outside. We're in a cabin, and he seems hurt. He's bleeding. - Just let me... - Hey man. Hey, just stay down there, okay? We're gonna get you some help. Ma'am, calm down. Does he have a weapon? - How severe are his wounds? - I don't know what's happening. Can you just come here? Send someone out, please. - It's happening! - Okay, Whoa, whoa. He's screaming. It's okay, it's okay. They're coming for me. Please. - Don't come on the porch. - Please. - What's happening outside? - Sir? Sir, we're going to help you out. Oh, God. Oh, God! Fucking Jesus Christ! Please! Yeah, I don't... I don't know what happened. He was really banged up, though. You know, it's tough with the drugs up here. Oh, yeah, yeah. Well, thank you again, officer, for... taking care of that so peacefully, it was really kind of scary there for a minute. Yeah. What brings you two up here? Getting a little stir crazy in your pen? Yes, definitely. Well, thank you very much, officer, for your help. I'm just gonna go inside and check up on our friend, Danny. Okay. Yeah, yeah. All right. - Thank you. Be safe. - You have a good night. - You too, goodnight. - Have a good night. Yeah, it's... it's bad up here. - You can't... - Oh, yeah, yeah. We try. We set up programs, but at least we were able to take care of that. For sure. You can take your mask off. He's gone. Oh no, I can keep it on. That's fine. Take your mask off. - Okay. - I'm sorry, I... I didn't mean to spook you, I just... - No, no. - We're, like, six feet apart. - And I wanted to see your face. - No, it's just, in L.A. I never take it off, so... Uh, I heard her say, your friend, is there... There's three of you up here? Yeah, yeah. Our friend's not feeling so hot, so we're looking out for him. Expecting any more company? - Gonna throw a little rager? - No! No, we're just trying to keep it small. You know, we... we just came up, the three of us, and we all got tested beforehand, so we're being as safe as possible. That's nice. It's nice with the Airbnb, business are still coming up there. Great to see some fresh faces. Oh yeah, for sure. Well, uh, I'm gonna go in. - Thank you. - Yeah. No, - I don't want to hold you up. - Thank you. Be safe. Be careful. Thank you again for everything. And, uh, you have a good night, officer. Have a good night. Thank you. That cop really weirded me out. I know, I don't know what's worse. Crazy Bob or creepy cop. Well, this trip turned out way more eventful than we planned. No shit. Thank God Danny was there to back me up, though. Yeah. Guys, I'm not feeling so great. I think I'm just gonna hit the hay. All right. Jesus, Danny, your finger! That looks awful! Dude, that looks fucking terrible. You want me to call creepy cop back? I will. - He's not doing anything. - No, no, no, no, no, it's fine. It's fine, guys. I cleaned it, I washed it, I'm just gonna... wrap it in some Neosporin or something, okay? Danny, are you sure you're okay? That looks really bad. Yeah. Yeah, guys, I'm fine. Honestly, the hangover's worse than the finger. So... Night. Goodnight? That looked really bad. You know what? Let's... Let's just make him go to a doctor tomorrow if he's not feeling well. Yeah, I mean, the hospital's, like, a 35 minute drive from here, so... Let's just do that. Okay. Should we make out? What? Come see the baby. - Hey, Danny boy. - Hey. Whoa, are you okay? Not great, but my fever broke, so... I just need some sleep. - Are you sure? - Yeah, yeah. Thank you for checking. Okay. Rest well, okay? - Goodnight. - 'Night. Danny. Danny, come feel the baby. Am I going blind? Oh, hello. Slide over. Okay. Hey, are you up? Mm-hm. Uh, I think we should, um... tell Danny. Already talked to him before the trip. - You did? - Mm-hm. And... he seems cool about it. Huh. Yeah, I'd... I'd better talk to him. There's no Wi-Fi. Or signal. Hey, dude. So, um, I just... Danny? Danny? Danny? Danny? I have absolutely no service. So... Danny's gone. What do you mean he's gone? Well, he's not in his room. He's not in the house. He's not on the deck. He's fucking gone. Maybe he drove to the hospital early this morning, - but why wouldn't he wake us? - Well, his car is here. What? I mean... Maybe he took an Uber or... called an ambulance or something? No, no, no, no. We would have heard an ambulance. Where could he have gone? I mean, I was gonna make breakfast. Where is he? Can you shut up? Put on pants. Let's go look for him. Damn it, fine. This sucks. Danny! Why would he go out into the woods? I don't know, but he took his jacket and his boots so he's probably fine. Let's just put on a movie and Postmate some Denny's. No, I have a bad feeling about this. We should just go looking for him. - Okay. Fine. - You can get Denny's after. Yeah. Great, fine. Freezing. God. Danny! Danny! What do you wanna eat later? I don't know. See what's in town, probably Denny's, but... Danny. Danny! Where are you? This dickhead. You know, this would actually be kind of a nice second date, if we aren't looking for our stupid friend. - Jesus, it's so muddy. God! - Danny! Danny! Danny, if you could show yourself before I get frostbite, that would be awesome. Danny! Danny, come on, let's get breakfast. At least I'm getting my steps in. Come on! I'm hungry. Danny, where are you? So pretty out here. It is. I'm just saying, if we don't make it out of here, I'll let you eat my body. I think we've progressed that far in our relationship. Can you be serious for a second? - It's starting to get cold. - I am serious. The sun is going down, we still have found this idiot. This is the biggest pinecone I've ever seen in my life. Do you remember what type of jacket he was wearing? No, I don't know. It's gray or navy blue or something. Danny! Sun's going down. Ow, what! Jeez. This is getting really trippy. This isn't like him. Danny! - I'm getting really cold. - Met too. Where is he? Danny! There's still no service. Damn it. What's going on? Sarah, we can't stay out here. The sun's going down, we gotta go back. Danny! Where are you? We should just drive up to town and maybe ask that cop for help. Okay, but we have to go. Come on, let's go. Come on, Sarah. Danny? Danny! Danny! What? Danny? You have got to be kidding me! Who is... Oh, my God! Danny? - What the hell? - Danny! Thank God you're all right. Where were you? Dude, you've been gone all day. We thought you were dead. I don't know. I just... needed to clear my head a little. And I did. - What? - That's it? That's fucking it? Dude, we've been outside in the freezing cold looking for your ass. Okay, all right. Calm down. Danny, that's really messed up. We thought you were dead. We were about to go to the police, the park ranger. I'm sorry. Shit. I am so sorry. I... woke up at, like, five this morning and... I just needed to be alone. Oh, you woke up at five AM and decided to go for a hike. You didn't tell the two people you're staying with where you might be going? That's fucking insane, Danny. Do you need us to call someone? Do I need to call Katie? Maybe she can come sort you out. - Fuck. - No. Katie, don't... No. Michael was just worried, okay? Are you sure you're okay? Yeah, I'm a lot better now. Oh, yeah, just going hiking at five AM like a normal person. Normal shit. Nothing to see here. Fuck! That was really weird, Danny. It's just... it's just been a really tough year, you know, quarantine was just kind of just the... the tip of the iceberg. Everything has just been really fuzzy lately. And... Well, you know what? Let's just calm down. It's not a big deal. We're all safe, let's just enjoy the rest of our time together. Okay? Let's chill. - Right? - Yeah. Yeah, I'm sorry, man. I... I... Shit, I could use the exercise. I'm just really fucking cold. Ooh, it's chilly out here. Hey. Want a hit? No, I'm good. So... Michael and I, we're... kind of a thing now. Great. I'm happy for you two. And don't worry, it's not gonna be like a third wheel kind of thing... Okay, Danny. Hey. What's up? Everything okay? Yeah, Danny's just being a dick about us. Oh, Okay. Shit. Let me go talk to him. - I mean... - It'll be okay. Hey, dude. What's up? So, you and Sarah? Yeah. Are you gonna be, like, okay with that? It's all good. Good, good. I've gotta admit, I was kind of worried about telling you. I mean, you know, how we were back in college... Were what? Well, we were basically dating. No, I don't. What are you talking about? We lived together. You saw her practically every night, I mean, it's not like we tried to hide it or anything. I don't remember like you do. Dude, what is your deal? This whole trip I've been trying to, like, reconnect with you. Did something happen with Katie? Why don't you talk to me, huh? I don't remember. I can't remember. Do you hear me? - What's going on? - Okay, that is it! He is fucking crazy. He tried to just choke me, Sarah. I'm out of here. Trip over. Come on. Okay, fine. You know what? But I'm out of here tomorrow. See ya. Danny, what's wrong? Nothing. How's your finger, by the way? Danny, your finger. God damn it! - Can you calm down? - You know what? You weren't seeing him, Sarah. You didn't see him out there, okay? I went out to try to talk to him. And he's forgetting obvious shit. And then he tried to strangle me, okay? He was trying to hurt me. - I get it. - I just... I can't be around that. Michael, you know, Danny's been through a lot. Oh, fuck that. We've all been through a lot. Okay? He's been super weird, and I've been trying to be normal about it. But he is off running around outside by himself. We're out there looking for him, like maniacs. Like, there's no excuse for that. Michael, can you... can you wait one minute - and just listen to me. - What? What? What can you say? What? Danny and Katie have been trying for kids. - Yeah, I know that. - They've been trying for years. Sure. And now they're not together, I get it. - Michael! - What? Katie had a miscarriage. Fuck. And... I'm sorry, I wasn't supposed to tell you, but... Danny... tried to take his life. What? Why wouldn't you have you told me that? I don't know. It's not my business to say, and I knew how you would react. Oh, oh. You knew how I'd react. Like what? Like, ten years ago react? Like, you still want to bring that up? - Fucking jerk. - Like a jerk. Oh yeah, that's right. I get fucking strangled, and I'm the fucking jerk. You know what? Get out. - Okay, I'm sorry. - Get the fuck out! - I'm sorry! - I didn't mean it that way. Fine. All right. Danny? Danny? Danny, come on, come back. Oh, fuck this. Sick of the drama queens. Bullshit. Guys? Nobody made coffee? Danny? Michael? Can you guys get over this already? We only have a few days left. Come on, let's enjoy it. Sarah? Sarah! I think something happened to Michael, Sarah. Sarah! Sarah! are you okay? I just want to help. Where you going, Sarah? Sarah! No use running, Sarah! Sarah! This'll all be over soon. Okay. Okay. Okay. Please. Mike! Michael. Mike. Michael? Michael... Michael, no... [sobbing Sarah! Sarah. This is not gonna hurt a bit. Sarah! Come on out. Sarah. Sarah. What are you? You know what we are. We're everywhere. We're all around. I didn't touch it! It's like it reached out and stung me or something. You weren't seeing him, Sarah. You didn't see him out there. He's forgetting obvious shit. They're coming for me. Great to see some fresh faces. We will replace...
