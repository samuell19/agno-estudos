[MELLOW MUSIC PLAYING] [CROWD SHOUTING AND CHEERING] [MAN PANTING AND GRUNTING] [GRUNTING] [GRUNTING] [GRUNTING] [GRUNTING] [CROWD] Aw! [MAN DISTORTED] Get up! [REFEREE] One... two... three four... five... six... ["LET ME CALL YOU SWEETHEART" PLAYING] What made you fall in love with an old man like me? - [SIGHS] I have no idea. - [BOTH LAUGH] We should turn in. All right. Early Stake Conference? President Smith's coming... - Right... that. - Yeah. - Yeah. - Okay. [INDISTINCT CHATTER] [BOYS] Hey, champ! [PRESIDENT SMITH] Willard Bean. Brother Willard Bean... Brother Willard Bean, will you please come to the stand? [INAUDIBLE CONVERSATION] [MOUTHING] What happened? What was that about with President Smith? He needs to see us right now. He mentioned something about a mission. A mission! You've already been on three missions, and we're just married! You're right. You be sure and mention all of that to the Prophet. [PRESIDENT SMITH] It's so nice to see you again, Willard, and Sister Bean, it's wonderful to meet you. I was so pleased to hear of your marriage. Now... here is what I wanted to speak with you about. Eight years ago the Church purchased the Joseph Smith farm. We are just now able to take possession of it. We need someone to live there and take care of the farm and re-establish the Church in that area. And when you stepped through that door today, it was like a voice said to me, "There's your man!" So I am extending a call to you and Rebecca to serve as missionaries and caretakers for the Joseph Smith farm. In New York? I discussed it with the Twelve and we agreed that it would be far too expensive to move the farm here. When would you like us to leave? [PRESIDENT SMITH] So, you'll accept the call? - [WILLARD] Of course, President. - Wonderful. [REBECCA] And for how long will we serve? [PRESIDENT SMITH] I think five years should do it. Now... this has been a hostile area for us. So your job will be to show them that we are good folks and... we can fit into their lovely community... as well as helping us to secure other precious Church history sites. [WILLARD] Thank you for the trust, President. But it's been 85 years since the Church left there. [CHUCKLES] All must be forgotten by now and surely can't be too bad. We heard you was coming. They heard we was coming! Brother and Sister Bean, may God go with you. Excuse me, kind sir! Can you direct me to the Joseph Smith farmhouse on Stafford road? [TENSE MUSIC PLAYING] [SIGHS] Well... he seems nice. Heeyah! You know, sweetheart, I may have to show these people a thing or two to get 'em to accept us. Now let's not start with that. I'm just sayin' people will respect a man who's willing to fight what he believes in. Willard... were any of Joseph and Emma's children born in the Smith farmhouse? I don't know, sweetheart. Why you ask? Oh, I just think it would be fun to know. I can find out. Do you think they have a good doctor here? I haven't been feeling too well. Oh, I'm sorry. You know what it is? It's all this travel. It happens to me, too. Trust me, this has never happened to you. [HAPPY MUSIC PLAYING] I think I'll have this for another seven months or so. Whoa! Rebecca! Are you...? [LAUGHS] Sweetheart! Yeehaw! [LAUGHING] Our life. Yeah. Yeehaw! I love our life! [LAUGHS] Look at this. Well, there it is. [TONGUE CLICKING] Where angels talked and prophets walked. [TONGUE CLICKING] - All right, dear, here you are. - Thank you. - I'll go get the front door for you. - Okay. - You good? - Uh-huh. I'll be right back to help you. [CLEARS THROAT] Sweetheart, you know what I forgot to do? I forgot to tell you this morning how beautiful you are. [REBECCA LAUGHS] - Look at it. - [SIGHS] We can do this. - I hope so. - We'll be just fine. We will be. - I'll give it everything I have. - All right. [REBECCA] Just be patient with me... while I'll try and make friends here. You will, dear, you're wonderful. All right, you ready? You can do this. I'll go take care of the rig. [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING] [SIGHS] [REBECCA] Everything all right? It's wonderful, thank you. You know, with that seed money we were given, we should be able to get this farm back on it's feet and running. [KNOCKING ON DOOR] Well, circle the calendar... we just got here and we already have our first visitors. Gentlemen! Welcome! Come in. [TENSE MUSIC PLAYING] All right. It'll be fine. [CLEARS THROAT] Well, happy to make your acquaintance, good neighbor. My name is Willard Bean. We know who you are. We'll say our piece, Mr. Bean, and be gone. As citizens of this community, we had a meeting this evening. It is the feeling of all who live here that you are to leave Palmyra. We drove you out of here years ago and you're not coming back. So, you best be on your way. Well, I'm sorry to hear that. So, we come out here hoping to... fit in with you good people and be an asset to the community. We hold no ill feelings for what your people did to us 80 years ago, though it was wrong and always will be. [SIGHS] So... you listen to me. We are here to stay... even if we have to fight our way. Now I could take you one at a time or three at once, whatever makes you happier. Well, come on! - We'll be back! - I'll be here. [MEN WHISPERING INDISTINCTLY] Willard... do you think you may have been too bold maybe? What? No. Honey... [CHUCKLES] didn't you feel the love just... [INHALES] - Flowing out of me? - [LAUGHS] Not really. [WILLARD HUMMING] [REBECCA EXCLAIMS] Sweetheart, you all right? Yes, I just, um... do you need something, dear? I'm heading to town... probably be the better part of the day into the night. So, it's best you not wait up for me. Into the night? Sweetheart. You needn't worry. We're being protected. - Love you. - Love you. [DOOR CLOSES] [BELL CHIMES] [INDISTINCT CHATTER] Good day, gentlemen! I am in need of a part for the singletree for my buggy and I was wondering if you had any available? Any at all... [WILLARD SCOFFS] It seems like such a simple question. Uh, we have those parts... but they're not for sale, uh, at this particular time. Oh, all right. Can you give me some idea as when the particular time will be that they are available? Well... I suspect... it all hinges on... who's wanting to buy 'em. [WILLARD LAUGHS] As I mentioned, I'm the one needing them, so I reckon I'll be the one buying 'em. Well... then they're not for sale. [TENSE MUSIC PLAYING] Then I'll just purchase them in Macedon today. Maybe they're not so particular about who they take their money from. And thanks for everything! [BELL CHIMES] [DOOR CLOSES] [MAN] Hey, Mormon! Seen any angels lately? [LAUGHING] I understand you Mormons believe in baptism by immersion. Yeah, we do! And we also believe in the laying on of hands! [MEN EXCLAIM] - Boogidy, boogidy! - Go, go, go! Pleasure to meet ya, neighbor! Thanks for the baptism. [KNOCKING ON DOOR] [KNOCKING ON DOOR] Good evening, ma'am. We are ministers and these ladies are school teachers. We have just been to a ministerial convention. We passed by Mormon Hill... and we thought we would drop in and see this place and hear a bit about Joe Smith. Please come in. - Good evening. - Good evening. My husband is in town, but I would be happy to share with you the story of the Prophet Joseph Smith. This is the home where the Prophet Joseph brought the plates after receiving them from the angel Moroni. [TENSE MUSIC PLAYING] He was a liar and a cheat, wasn't he? [SHOUTING INDISTINCTLY] [REBECCA] They came as if they wanted to learn... [SHOUTING INDISTINCTLY] But in reality they came to taunt and hurt. I felt darkness invade our home... it was thick... and it had power. I began to pray for help. At that moment, I felt the presence of someone standing beside me... everyone in the room fell silent. I bear testimony... that Joseph Smith was a Prophet of God and I feel his presence in this home... even now. Anyone who prayfully seeks will know also. He taught as the Savior did... preaching love and forgiveness. Apologies for our actions, ma'am. I felt the Prophet Joseph's love... and that's what seemed to turn them around. Dear... we are being protected. [WHISPERING] That's her. [KNOCKING ON DOOR] Pardon me, ma'am. I was told someone in this house is a nurse. Would that be yourself? Lovely. I will be having a child in a few months and I'm in need of a nurse to assist me... [WOMAN] Go back to Utah where you belong! I know it would be somewhat of a bother. I would take as little of your time as possible, but... I know who you are, Mrs. Bean. Nobody here is going to help you. I did not train in child delivery to help a Mormon! - No! - I can't tell you how happy it would make me to know that you would come and... [REBECCA CRYING] I think we're all alone. Sweetheart, we won't be. We won't be. Shh! It'll be all right. [REBECCA] For our many blessings we thank thee and acknowledge thy hand in our lives. We pray that the way may be opened for us to receive the help that we need with the baby that we are about to bring into this world. These blessings we ask for in Jesus' name, Amen. Amen. Thank you. You know, it occurs to me... there is one possibility for a mid-wife we haven't even considered. Really? Who'd that be? [MOUTHS] You. [SCOFFS] Becca... a man can't be there when the baby is born! He can if there is no one else. [SIGHS] You can't do this for me? You've delivered horses and calves before. [SIGHS] Sweetheart, you're not a cow. Thank you for noticing, dear. [HUMMING] - I'm in love with you... - Moo! [KNOCKING ON DOOR] Howdy, neighbor! We're the Beans. We just... Wait a minute. Is that... Is this what they've been doing to you? [KNOCKING ON DOOR] Good morning, we are Willard and Rebecca Bean... Well, that was uncalled for. That was uncalled for. Big tough guy! [COW MOOING] Hey, Mormon! I been meaning to tell you, what a gaul... [COW MOOING] Church you belong to. There's nothing worse on this earth than an idiot Mormon... and you can just take your... [COW MOOING] And your visions and your glories and you can just collect yourselves up - into a bright red sack and head straight back to... - [COW MOOING] And while you're there why don't you make friends with the devil. Because you and him, you're gonna be around each other for a long... [GRUNTS] [MOOING] [PRESIDENT SMITH] Brother Bean, please know that the First Presidency and the Twelve pray for you daily. Your mission is in the forefront of our minds. We are desirous of you approaching those who own the Hill Cumorah and asking their selling price. [WILLARD] Hey, good lookin'! You one of them Mormons? - Through and through. - [LAUGHS] Have you come to drive me away? Well, yes, I have. Get in. [PLAYFUL MUSIC PLAYING] - Where are you taking me? - You'll see. Is it all right for us to be here? I just thought it was time that we visit the site that President Smith wants us to purchase. But the current owner may not be so pleased about us being here. Oh, what do they care? They got better things to do than worry about two strangers... [GUNSHOT] [MAN] Hey! Hey, you! What do you think you're doing? See? They don't mind. They already sent their welcoming committee! - Are you those Mormons moved into the old Smith place? - [WILLARD] We are. We just wanted to walk to the top of the hill if that's all right. It ain't all right. It ain't even close to all right. And there ain't no Mormon gonna set foot on this hill again... never! Now you need to climb back in that ratty buggy of yours and get on outta here before I do some real damage to ya! All right, we'll be on our way. First... I wanna thank you for your warm welcome to your friendly village. We had heard it was going to be really difficult for us here, but... well, you've renewed our hope and faith in humanity, so... We're Willard and Rebecca Bean. Happy to be your new neighbors. Never! All right, well, Rebecca, we should go, we shouldn't dilly dally all day here in the good company of this gentleman. Oh, neighbor... I don't think I caught your name. Never! - Do you think "Never" is his first name, or last name? - [BOTH LAUGH] It's hard to say. Idiot Mormons. [REBECCA] How do you do it? How can you remain so positive... when everyone despises us? [CHUCKLES] Practice. When you serve a mission in the South in the 1890's, you have plenty of practice. Were they mean to you? Oh, not so much mean to me as they were to the Elders we replaced when we got there. What did they do to them? Killed them. Killed them dead? [GLASS LANDING ON TABLE] What did they do to you? [MAN] Get out of here, you Mormons. Get out of here. [MAN] Show us a sign! Show us a sign Mormon boys! We want to see a sign. Lemme put it this way... You boys say you got the true religion. Well, you better show us a sign, or we're gonna show you a sign of some real nice southern hospitality. [CROWD SHOUTING, LAUGHING] All right, all right. I will be more than happy to oblige you with a sign. First... my companion, he hasn't been out here very long, right. He's not used to this sort of thing. So, would it be okay if we sent him down the road a bit... and then I'll be happy to show you boys a sign. - Okay. - What'd ya say? All right, all right. Elder Tanner, you... go ahead and make your way down the road. I'll, I'll be right after you. I'll be right behind ya. [BIRD CAWING] All right. [WILLARD] So... it's very evident to me... that you are very well versed in Bible and in the scriptures because you know... that the Lord has shown... many signs. The sign I'm gonna show you is... it's a heavenly sign... and it's a sign that's been passed down from time gone by. I... am gonna strike you blind. [MAN] What? [MAN] Whoa, whoa. [MOB LEADER] Ow. I can't see! I can't see! That's 'cuz you're blind! Run Elder! Run for your life! - [MOB LEADER] I can't see! - [MAN] Get those Mormons! [CROWD SHOUTING] Go, go. Go. [TANNER] Do you think we can outrun 'em, Elder? [WILLARD LAUGHS] I only have to outrun you! Ooh. Wait, I'm kidding. [GUNSHOT] - Wait, I'm your senior companion. - You have to wait! - [GUNSHOT] - You didn't. - I did. - You didn't. - I did. I told my mission president, J. Golden Kimball, I said, "I will turn the other cheek, if they can hit the first one." [BOTH LAUGHING] [SIGHS] That's what I said. That's what we got to do, sweetheart. We just got to keep swinging. Just, just keep swinging. True story. [KNOCKING ON DOOR] [REBECCA] I'll get it! [FOOTSTEPS TOWARDS DOOR] [DOOR OPENING] [REBECCA] Hello. [ETHEL HACK] Mrs. Bean, I understand that you have been trying to find someone to help with the delivery of your baby. [REBECCA] That's right. [ETHEL] I am not a trained nurse but I have done some attending and I would be happy to assist. You know who we are, correct? I know you're good people. My brother was curious about the Mormons and so he went to Utah to see for himself. He enjoyed it so much he moved there. And so here I am, happy as a lark to help in any way. [REBECCA] Thank you so much. The baby is due any day now and we have a room upstairs for you to stay in. [EHTEL] I'll just go back home and pack my things and be back this afternoon. Don't worry, Mrs. Bean, everything is going to be just fine. Thank you so much. [REBECCA] Thank you. Willard! She's going to help me, sweetheart. She's gonna help me. So does this mean I don't get to be in with you when you have the baby? No, Willard. She's going to help me. [MOUTHS] Thank you. That is wonderful news... wonderful. - [BIRDS CHIRPING] - [ROOSTER CROWING] [BABY CRYING] [FOOTSTEPS ON STAIRS] Mr. Bean, you are the father of a beautiful, healthy baby girl. - I am? - Yes, Sir. And I think it's about time you two decided on a name for her. Oh, we know her name. Her name is Palmyra. [WILLARD LAUGHS] Look at her! She's beautiful! She is beautiful! I'm ready, daddy! Yes you are. You look beautiful! - [PALMYRA LAUGHING] - Oh, there you go. I will see you cuties back here in an hour. All right, dear. [DOG BARKING] Come on Palmyra, - let's go buy some girl things. - [WILLARD GRUNTS] All right, ladies. Have fun. I'll see you later. [DOG BARKING] Hello puppy! Hello little puppy! [MRS. RHODES] Stop! Don't you dare touch my dog. Don't you ever touch my dog again. I'd advise you to keep control of your child, madam. No Mormon is ever allowed to touch any dog in Palmyra. Sweetie, I'm sorry. She's not very happy, is she? We have a lot more animals than she does. We'll let her pet our animals if she ever comes to our place. Maybe that will make her happy. Yeah? Okay. Come on. [WILLARD] So, Mr. Sexton... what would you consider a fair price for the hill now? I'd love to sell you the hill... but it has to be on my terms. Of course, and what would that be? Same as before, one hundred thousand dollars. A hundred thousand. That is still too much for my church to handle. We can do thirty-five. Hmm. I understand. You know I don't own the entire hill. James Welch has that smaller farm on the west side. Have you met with him? Yes, we have. We call him "Never." Haven't heard him called that before. Well... that's the way he introduced himself to me... from the back end of a shotgun. Between he and me, Mr. Bean, it looks like you've got your work cut out for you. Yeah, I suppose I do. But what happened to make you so late? Did you get lost? I met with Mr. Sexton and then I had to go all the way to Macedon to get the part I needed. You mean they ran out of parts in Palmyra again? No, they ran out of manners again. Is there something going on at the Hill tonight? [WILLARD] Haven't you seen that before? Nope. Nope. Yeah, they're digging up the hill. They're looking for gold. They dig even though they don't believe? They believe in gold. [INDISTINCT CONVERSATION] It looks pretty. Yeah, it does, doesn't it? [CHILDREN TALKING] Excuse me. I'm Rebecca Bean - and this... - Yes, we've, um, been expecting you. And your name is? Palmyra. Don't worry. You'll make friends soon. This will be fine. Class! Take your seats, please. Thank you. We have a new student in our class this year. Her name is Palmyra. [LAUGHING] And my name is Chicago! [CHILDREN LAUGHING] Take your seat please, dear. [MILDRED DEWEY] Now, class, there is much to cover this year. You first graders are going to have to work very hard to keep up. It won't be easy - but it will be well worth the effort. - [CHAIR MOVING] Every day I will expect you to come back with your homework prepared, all your T's crossed, all your I's dotted. And always, of course, it's very important you stay in your assigned seats and that you follow our class rules. Now, who can tell me, what is the newest state in The United States of America? Who knows? Who knows? June. Uh, Opalohma. No. Eldon? - Ummm... - No, that's not it. [CHILDREN LAUGHING] - Columbia? - Arizona? Very good, Columbia. [MILDRED] Now, Arizona became the 48th state of the United States of America on Valentines day... [BIRDS CHIRPING] [MAN] Ma'am? Looks like you could use a little help. Ma'am. [REBECCA] Thank you. My husband's away working hard himself and... having enough wood for the kitchen can sometimes get left behind. Oh, I've never been afraid of hard work. I also know a little something about being hated... even before... people get a chance to know ya. I have a piece of fresh baked pie right there in the kitchen. I'll be right back with a proper thank you. You're good people. [REBECCA] You're so kind to give your help. I don't mind the work I have to do, but... firewood is harder for me than most of my other chores. Now you just hold for a bit while you... [CHILDREN TALKING] We will begin this morning by reviewing our multiplication tables. One times seven is... [ALL CHILDREN TOGETHER] Seven. Two times seven is... [ALL CHILDREN TOGETHER] Fourteen. Three times seven is... [ALL CHILDREN TOGETHER] Twenty-one. Four times seven is... [ALL CHILDREN TOGETHER] Twenty-eight. Five times seven is... [ALL CHILDREN TOGETHER] Thirty-five. [MILDRED] Six times seven is... [ALL CHILDREN TOGETHER] Forty-two. [MILDRED] Seven times seven is... [ALL CHILDREN TOGETHER] Forty-nine. [MILDRED] Eight times seven is... [ALL CHILDREN TOGETHER] Fifty-six. [ELDER GATES] Sister Bean? I'm Elder Crawford Gates and this is Elder David Adams. And Elder Bob Bitner and Elder Gordon Hinckley. We've just finished our missions and are on our way home. Would it be possible to spend the evening here before we catch our train tomorrow in Rochester? Certainly, Elders. You're welcome to stay. Why don't you leave your suitcases and I can have our daughter take you out to the Sacred Grove while I make your rooms ready. Palmyra! We have Elders to take care of! Hello, Elders. [PALMYRA] This is the Sacred Grove. Lots of these trees were here then... but they're older now. We don't know right where he prayed, but somewhere close by. So Heavenly Father and Jesus were here, too... and talked to him... and told him what he should do. I think it was a good thing that Joseph Smith prayed here... don't you? Yes... it was a very good thing. [ELDER GATES] Thank you for the tour, Palmyra. You did such a wonderful job... I would like to give you... this. Is this a nickel? Yeah! A whole nickel. Thank you... but... can I have a dime instead? A nickel isn't enough? Well... I don't know how to pay my tithing with a nickel, but I can with a dime. Try this. [ELDER GATES] Sister Bean, did you know you're famous? The word is out in all the missions, "Don't go home until you've had a meal from Sister Bean at the Smith Farm." This is the best food I've had since leaving home. There must be so many who come here. How do you do it? Elders... I have something to share with you regarding your question. There was a hot summer day and we had had a lot of visitors. We'd just had Alvin and I had to carry him most the day just to get my work done. [BABY CRYING] The Apostle, Elder Talmage, was here and we'd had a wonderful evening but I was so exhausted, I was in tears and I still had much to be done. Everyone was in bed and asleep but me. Finally I got ready for bed. I was crying about my hardships when this dream or... vision came to me. [KNOCKING ON DOOR] [DOOR OPENING] [REBECCA] There was a knock at the door and a very handsome young man was standing there. I just knew he was another missionary that had come to see us. He and Elder Talmage seemed so happy to see each other... and talked about wonderful things while they were eating. The spirit was so peaceful... and they seemed so happy to be together. After the meal, I put Alvin to bed and went and talked alone with the young man. He told me how sweet and well behaved my children were and I was so happy about that. He walked into the hall... and as I went to wish him goodbye... it was the Savior that stood before me... in all his glory. I couldn't tell you the love and the sweetness that he had in his face. He said, "Sister Bean", if you go about your work every day as you have done this day, you will be equal to it. Remember these missionaries represent me on this earth, and all that you give unto them, "you give unto me." Elders, you ask me how I can do it, day after day, and year after year. How can I not do it? I know who you are. And all that I do for you... I do for Him. [SOFT MUSIC PLAYING] [CHILDREN PLAYING OUTSIDE] [CHILDREN PLAYING OUTSIDE] [CHILDREN PLAYING] Hey, Palmyra, you wanna play? [PALMYRA] Okay. - [PALMYRA GRUNTING] - [CHILDREN LAUGHING] Everything all right, dear? In town, I heard Mr. Sexton died. - Oh, no. - Yeah. With him gone, I don't know if we'll ever be able to obtain all of Cumorah. His heirs, they hate the Church. Pledged they'd never sell at any price. Maybe it's time to stand aside and... let the Lord take it from here. Yeah. - [DOG BARKING] - [FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING] Palmyra? Is that you? [PALMYRA SOBBING] Honey, what happened? Nobody likes me. Oh, sweetie. I'm sorry. [PALMYRA] Why can't somebody just be nice to me? [REBECCA] Oh, my little angel. I'm so sorry we've done this to you. I don't have any friends either. I just have Daddy and I have Alvin... and I have you. But I don't have anybody to play with. Oh, sweetie. These are good people. We just have to give them time to know that we're good people, too. We just need to keep being nice. I'm sick of being nice. [REBECCA] Oh. There was another little child that used to live in this house who didn't have any friends either. Do you know who I mean? - Joseph Smith? - That's right. And he just kept trying and trying. Yeah, and then they killed him. That's right... - but not you. - [PALMYRA SNIFFLING] [GRUNTING] Oh. [THUDS] [REFEREE] One, two... three... Willard? [ROOSTER CROWING] Willard! Willard. Willard. Did you hear me? Oh, sorry. Yeah, we've been here six years and they still hate us. I'm trying to do everything that's right and... maybe I'm doing something wrong. I don't know. Maybe it's time to do what you do best. Irritate you? Put out a challenge. Right. Challenge the entire town to join the Church? No. To get in the ring with you. Really? Really? Maybe we'll make some friends. [UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING] This is going to be perfect. This is exactly what we're going to need. - Are you going to have an issue with... - Not at all, thank you. [UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING] Afternoon. I'd like 50 copies of that. How are you? Come and see the Mormon get beat up. Here you go. Hope you come! Come watch my dad beat up people. Hi. ... Have a good day. Here. Good job, honey... Sweetheart. One thing I was thinking about with your boxing exhibition... Mmm-hmm. You know you're slightly older now. Mmm-hmm. Before you get back in the ring again, you may want to do a little exercising? Just a thought. Time just... has a way of slowing us down. Whatever you think's best. [UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING] - [PANTING] - Drink it. - Drink it? - Yes. Mommy... Don't be scared. - Mmm... Oh... - Yay. - Thank you. - Yeah. Very good. That's it. - That's it! - Willard! You know, we were just playin'. Whoo-hoo! - [CONTINUES HOOTING] - [GUNSHOT] Hey! I told you to git! - Get on out of here, you idiot Mormon! - Oh, no, oh, no, oh, no! [INDISTINCT CHATTER] [CONTESTANTS CHATTERING] [REBECCA] Please be careful, dear. I'll be careful not to hurt 'em too badly. I certainly hope this works and we make some friends. All right. Well, the show must go on. All right. All right, all right! Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your attendance. I am Willard Bean. You know me as "the idiot Mormon." [CROWD CHUCKLING] But I am also known as "The Fighting Preacher." - [CROWD LAUGHING] - [MAN] Yeah, we'll see. The rules of the event tonight are those of the Amateur Boxing Association. Three rounds, winner by knockout, otherwise a draw. All right... let's get this started. Who's our first challenger? - [MAN] Buster! - [CROWD CHEERING AND APPLAUDING] How are you, good sir? What's your name? Buster. Buster. Buster, did you come with anybody tonight? All right. Boys, you stay seated till I give you this sign. All right? Got it? Perfect. Ready to get started? All right. [CROWD CHEERING] [WOMAN] Let's go, let's go. Go Daddy! [CHEERING] Buster, get him! Hit him! [CROWD] Oh! Oh! Oh! [MAN] Get up! [MAN] Get up! All right, next challenger. - [MAN 1] Big Hank. - [MAN 2] Come on, come on. [MAN 3] Big Hank, Big Hank. [MAN 4] Get up, let's go. [LAUGHS] I remember you. Just here for some good old fashioned fun. Uh... [CHUCKLES] Hopefully, there'll be no offense. [GRUNTS AND GROANS] - [CROWD GASPING] - None taken. You know, for me, boxing's a very Christian sport. I give much more than I receive. [CHUCKLES] All right, who's next? - [CROWD APPLAUDING] - You look good, hun. [GROANING] [CROWD] Oh! ["LET ME CALL YOU SWEETHEART" PLAYING] [FIGHTER YELLING] - [CROWD BOOING] - [MAN] What a show off! - [BELL RINGS] - [THUDS] [CROWD BOOING] Boogidy, boogidy! [LAUGHS] All right, who's next? [CROWD CHEERING AND APPLAUDING] Let's go. [CROWD JEERING] Oh, looks like we're out of challengers. Anyone else? - Anyone? - [MAN] Mormon show off. Thank you for your attendance! I hope you enjoyed the Fighting Preacher show. [CROWD BOOING AND COMPLAINING] Just because you're a good fighter, doesn't make you a good man. [GROANS] You're no preacher. Well, golly, that was a success. [PANTING] [SIGHS] I don't know what else to do. [SIGHS] Maybe we should just throw in the towel, go home. Daddy, maybe you should just be nice. Be nice? That's what Mommy always says. Maybe sometimes, the best way to fight is with love. [REFEREE'S VOICE ECHOING] One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine... [BELL ECHOING] [PANTING] Are you all right, lad? Not looking good, Mr. Bean. I'm going to have to call the fight. No. No, no. [PANTING] I got it. I got it. I just... I got to change tactics. [PANTING] I'll do it. I'm fine. [PANTING AND SNIFFLING] I'm fine. - [PANTING] - [MAN] Go get him! Sweetheart? You and Palmyra are exactly right. My approach to what we're doing back here is... It needs an adjustment. We're gonna change tactics, we're gonna do the Savior's way, - we will... - [SNORING] [SIGHS] Thanks for listening. [CHUCKLES SOFTLY] Good talk. Sweetheart, I have an idea. This should be ready. Oh, boy. It's beautiful. Let's put this on the table. All right. Thank you, sweetheart. Oh, and don't get shot. - Yes, dear. - [DOOR CLOSES] Can't you get it through your thick skull? No Mormons on this hill. Now, unless you made a recent change in your religion, that means you. Silly me. I forgot. [GRUNTS] Thanks for the reminder. I said "never." Do you like pie? What kind of pie? Apple. Maybe. Now git! It's still warm. It's all yours. From the missus. Good to see you, neighbor. Know that he recognizes your struggles, and loves you, and is there for you... Mrs. Rhodes? - Mrs. Rhodes? - [MUFFLED] Who is it? - It's Rebecca Bean. - Who? Rebecca Bean... from over on Stafford Road. Come in. I'm upstairs. Mrs. Rhodes, I'm told you're not doing well. Not so good. I brought you some potato soup. Oh... you darling. Uh... how do I know you? You know, I live at the Smith farm over on Stafford Road. I love to make soup. My mother used to say, "Soup heals the body and the soul." Mmm... that's lovely. - [WILLARD] Have a good day. - Well, thanks. - Here, squash. - Thank you. - Have some beans? - Thank you. Have a good day. I have some beans for you. Have a great day. - Nice to meet you. - So nice. That was a nasty wind. [CHUCKLES] Any other damage around here I can help you with? What are you doing? Mending fences. [KNOCKING AT DOOR] [BETTY SUE] Come in. Mrs. Webster? I'm volunteering with the Red Cross. I'd like to help you and your new baby. [SNIFFLES] Come in. [REBECCA] Hi. I've come to offer a gift of clothing and to help you in any way that I can. I hope this will make your baby feel better. You've been here before. Do you remember me, Mrs. Bean? Yes, Mrs. Webster. I'm happy to see you again. I'm happy to see you, too. Mr. Bean? I am Charles Collins, this is my wife, Maude. We'd like to speak with you. May we come in? Please. Nice to meet you. I've seen you around. Through the laying on of hands, the Lord wants you to know that he loves you. And although it seems at times hard to see, he's never going away. I bless you with health and with strength that your body may respond to those treatments that have been given you, that you may find happiness in the meantime, that all might be well, that you might feel the presence of your Heavenly Father helping you through this. [CHILDREN CHATTERING AND LAUGHING] You make the best soups, Mrs. Bean. Mrs. Rhodes, did you ever have any trouble with your children at school? Oh, just the same as everybody else, I guess. Some of the children giving your girl some problems? For sure she can't be mean back to them. We're all going through the same things. It seems to me, nothing's as good as treating others the way you'd like to be treated. The golden rule. [SOFTLY] Though... be so careful. Well, what are you two up to? Mommy's helping me be nice. Be nice? Sweetheart, are they still being mean to you at school? Honey, I will show you... a left hook that will teach them a thing or two. Come with me. Come on. Come on. What? Oh, right. Okay, well, you two carry on. Hey! So I'm supposed to like you because you give me pies? No, you're just supposed to eat the pie. [CHILDREN CHATTERING] [RATBOY] Oops. [MILDRED] We will begin now by practicing our handwriting. Get out your paper and pencils. Your handwriting, children, is of utmost importance. That is why we practice it every single day. People will judge you by your handwriting before they even meet you. So it is absolutely essential that all of your "T's" be crossed correctly, all your "I's" dotted, all your letters formed with precision in articulate, absolutely correct form. Otherwise, people may gain an incorrect impression of you before they even have the opportunity to meet you. Here in this class, we form the foundations of character, of your future life. [WATERMAN] I appreciate your help with that shed. One more gust and I think it'd be gone. Nothin' to it, Ben. [BOTH PANTING] You need to know, Willard, we're good folks around here. [PANTING] I know that. I see it every day. But all the bother we've given you, it's just the way we've been brought up. It's us trying to do what we think is right. I understand. It's... We're all trying to learn, right? At least we ought to be. I hope you don't mind me asking, Willard, but we all wonder, are you a polygamist? [CHUCKLES] No, sir, I'm not. My Daddy was. He had three wives and... I'm one of 30 of his children. Thirty kids? [LAUGHING] Imagine that. Pretty tough getting a turn at the outhouse, huh? [LAUGHING] I suppose so. Yeah, polygamy ended years ago. But I will tell you this, my friend. Rebecca's my second wife. You don't say. My first wife was Gussie. She was a lovely lady. I just, uh... I didn't give her her just due. I was always working, or... boxing, or... gone. And some man started flattering her, and... showing her attention, and just... being there for her. So she left me. I divorced her. And, uh, she and the mister got married soon thereafter. Not long after that, he started beating her. Six months into their marriage, he took her life. I should have done better. [SIGHS] But Rebecca... [CHUCKLES] she is wonderful. She is my sweetheart. I'm just... trying to do better. Last year, President Harding won the election over James Cox by a landslide. And now some people are saying their vote didn't matter and that it never matters. Let's talk about that. Does one vote... make a difference? Who has an idea? - I do. - Go ahead. I think every person's vote matters. And... why is that? Because even if everybody else thinks different and you're just one person, you're still a person. And other people should listen to what you say too, because you still have feelings. [KNOCKING AT DOOR] Can you play? Momma, can I play? [REBECCA] With who? My best friend! [BOTH GIGGLING] Our first baptisms in 90 something years. - Thank you, Brother Bean. - Oh no, thank you, thank you, thank you. - Oh, hey, have I told you two about Church callings? - I'm so happy for you. No? I must have forgot. I'll be in the barn. [TELEPHONE RINGING] [TELEPHONE RINGING] Oh, no. Now what am I supposed to say? [WHISPERS] Hello. - [LOUDLY] Hello! - Not so loud. - Just regular. - [KONGER] Mr. Bean. This is Mr. Konger. I am the lawyer handling the estate of Pliny Sexton. Hello. - Yes, Mr. Konger. - Not every time. Just... [MR. KONGER] I'd like to meet with you about the Mormon Hill property. Would it be possible for you to come down to Mr. Sexton's old office? Certainly, let me just finish what I was doing. [MR. KONGER CHUCKLES] I, uh, think you'll want to come now Mr. Bean, while you still have the chance. All right, I'm on my way. Good? [WHISPERS] Oh, boy. The last heir who was antagonistic toward the Mormons has passed away and the remaining heirs are currently in the position of just wanting to get rid of it. Now, I know you've made an agreement with Mr. Welch on the other portion of the hill, which frankly, I don't know how you pulled that one off. Well, I can assure you, it had more to do with love and kindness than it did with money. [SCOFFS] I still don't get that, but in any case, are you still interested? At what price, sir? The price you've always held to. In that case, Mr. Konger, we are very interested. Very good. I'll get the paper work to you as soon as... Daddy, I think I heard the mailman. The mailman came, Daddy. Do you need anything? No, thank you, Palmyra. - What's wrong, sweetheart? - [SNIFFLES] "Dear Brother and Sister Bean," For 25 years, you and Sister Bean have labored faithfully as missionaries in Palmyra, New York. With appreciation for your loyalty and faithfulness, we now extend to you an honorable release from your assignment. With love and immeasurable gratitude, "President Heber J. Grant." [SNIFFLING] [REBECCA SIGHS] [WILLARD SIGHS] [WILLARD] Where'd it all go? [SNIFFLING] It was a week ago that we arrived here. Now they want us to go home? [INHALES DEEPLY] We've come to love these people like family. Rebecca, what's happened to our life? [REBECCA SOBBING] The time passed away, and also our lives passed away, like as it were unto us a dream. [THOMAS WINEGAR] When they settled on the Smith Farm, some of our citizens, me included, started a tirade with the object of getting rid of them. But when they proved to be good citizens, we learned to tolerate them, then admire them and respect them, and now we love them. Willard was at first denied membership into our organization, then later on becoming our President. It is with reluctance that we now bid farewell to the kindest family that ever lived in Wayne County. Willard has a way about him that seems to turn enemies into friends. His fearless demeanor, it just seems to rub off, and we all wish that we had what he has. Willard and Rebecca also found time to raise their family. Both Palmyra and Alvin graduating from our High School as Valedictorians. The Mormon Church may think it knows what it's doing by sending them back, but we don't think so. [ALL LAUGHING] They couldn't have found another man who could have done the things that you have done here. And if we went to the civic club today to take a vote as to whom is the most popular man in Palmyra, it most certainly would be Willard Bean. Goodbye. [THOMAS WINEGAR] They have won a warm spot in our hearts and will ever forever live in the memory of this generation. Love you. Thanks. Goodbye. [THOMAS WINEGAR] Willard and Rebecca, we absolutely hate to see you go. [JAMES WELCH] Don't leave! Never! [THOMAS WINEGAR] May God bless you and go with you... in all that you do. Eight, nine, ten. Out! Ladies and gentlemen, the 1905 middle-weight champion of the world, - Willard Bean! - [CROWD CHEERING] ["LET ME CALL YOU SWEETHEART" PLAYING ON RADIO] [TITLE MUSIC PLAYING]
