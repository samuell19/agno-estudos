COME TOMORROW Evgenia TASHKOVA - Citizen! - Girl, where are you going? Well, let’s go out first! - My bag. - There, over your bag. Throw it here. Pima. - To whom is the porter? - Thank. - Young lady, let me help you. - No. Well, well, you so many things have been imposed on yourself. - Let's... - No. - What is it?! - Oh! Well, it’s because you won’t reach you. Why bother? There is a call. Right. - But I did not know and did not see. - So what? - I am to you. - Yes? So here, probably, this one lives here, like him... like him... Now... House twenty three, apartment eight. And here... what's the name... Surname... forgot. Well? But! I probably put it in the basket. Now. - What are you looking for? - A letter. - Good evening. - Oh! - Good evening, Yuri Borisovich. - Is that what guests are to you? - Yes, I don’t know. - Oh, what a dog, but... Where is it? After all, it was the same. - Well? - Do you know who wrote the letter? Who! He works in our school as a manager. Ivan Kirillovich his name. He was a supply manager at your school when you studied. - Where did you study? - In Zaporozhye. Here you go! So this is when it was. - And then he moved to us. - I do not remember. He stopped at your passage six years ago. Two days, what? Well? Ivan Kirillovich his name. - Ivan Kirilych. - Ivan Kiri... - Ah... - Remember? - So he wrote you here? - Yes of course. Ivan Kirilych. - Hm-yes. Well, come on in. - Oh! It’s good that you remembered. And then right at least scream. Well, I have no one in Moscow except you. Shout straight. Well, how is he, a supply manager something alive? Alive, why should he? Works. - And what is it with you? - Where? - Well, this is yellow. - This is honey. - Well, in Moscow there is no honey, or what? - So it's mine. Home. What is your name? - Frosya. - Yeah. Well then, let's drink tea then, Frosya. Then you get tired of the road. You need to rest. Nothing. Are you passing, Frosya? Or come? No, I came to Moscow. Where did you come from? - From Yeltsovka. - Ah, where is it? This is in Siberia. Here, for tea. - It's good there? - Good. Calmly. And there is no crush. Oh water! And you don't have to carry it, but we have wells. Here you pull it there, pull it... Oh! My shoulders hurt. Today I dragged things all day. After all, while you find... Didn’t you like it in Moscow? How to say... It is vain. Uneasy. And the head is popping. - What village are you from? - I'm not from the village. The village is nearby - Yeltsovka. Eight kilometers from us. And I'm from the apiary. My aunt was a forester. Oh oh. What kind of dirt is this? - No clay? - Yes. - And for what? - So it is. Unclear. Something I do not see your wife. Where's she? Really, where is she? I do not have a wife. - But there was. - It was. - You must have left her. - No, she left me. But! Why? Frosy, you ask too many questions. I won’t do it again. And who is cleaning everything up here? A woman lives here alone, like a mistress, today she is a day off. Yeah. Unclear! - Do housewives have a weekend? - There are. There are... - Well, Fros, come on. - Oh, they presented a whole jug. I do not drink. I remembered! Kolya is cognac. - Your name is Nikolai Vasilievich. - Yes! - I got everything, everything said about you. - Well, how is he there? The manager is alive? Oh yes, already asked. Well, what are you going to do in Moscow? Protrude. Oh, No. What I speak is. You still need to learn. Why are you laughing? I performed every Saturday at my place. Well, you have not heard. What are you laughing at? - Not heard, but laugh. - I was just joking. What institute are you going to enter? - Artist. In which? - There are many universities in Moscow. - A lot of? - A lot of. Why so much then. Ah, not enough artists then. No, I do not know. I would not say that. - Quite the opposite. - So what, a lot of artists? This is already worse. Well! What is this? Everyone sings, what? - Ah, to sing? - Well yes. So it’s at a music institute or at a conservatory. Yeah. Well, is there a voice, huh? - I do not know, I was in the village. - Was in the village? Amusing, amusing. And you are a good person, you see. How could this wife leave you... If you want to eat... look in the refrigerator. - Do you hear, Frosya? - Yeah. I'll be back soon. Something Marya Semyonovna is not. - What is it? - Where? - Yes, on you. - This dress. - Mom's day off. - Hm-yes. You don’t go anywhere without me. Get lost. And here I come, and we will go with you to the institute or to the conservatory. If anyone calls me, you say, I will be in an hour and a half. Ahhh... Ahhh... - I went to swallow an egg. - But? - And why? - That the voice sounded better. - Why, does it sound bad? - But? - I say it sounded bad? - Do you like it? - And you? - What? - But not very. - Why are you standing here then? - What? - Listen... And what are you protecting her? What, is she your dear aunt, or what? Aunt, aunt... Stand here. - But? - Yes, why are you, deaf, what? Why are you listening to this, huh? - I am? - Yes. Ah... the door is closed. I see that it’s closed. What's your business? - Where are you going? - My suitcase is there. - What ?! - Things, things, a suitcase. Ah stuff! Yes? Ah, Kolya, hello. So, dear, it's not I who came late, it's you who left early. Yes. Ah... Yeah. Yes. Okay. Well? What are you worth? Come in. - Are you Frosya? - I am. - And how did you find yourself behind the door? - As I got out, she slammed shut. Slammed shut... Oh, how much dirt! You leave for one day, and he looks like a clutter. - Or did you start to get out? - Yeah. In vain. They hurt dirt like a mess. - Who? - Painters. Artists too. And ours, you know who? Sculptor. Even worse. Endlessly wears this clay, and then... stones. - And let's litter. Will you - No, we just drank. After all, before that, I lived with the artist. He really loved to be praised. He painted all landscapes. Here, it used to put a sackcloth, brush on it with a brush, steps aside and looks. I forgot how he called this sackcloth. Man... manber. Dirt spreads on it, then takes a knife, and scrapes it all. Then he will shout to me: "Marya Semyonovna, come here." Well, I think, finished, then... I’ll come up and throw up my hands: "Father, I’m done with it." "Mm, good!" Then I silently stand before her. He loves it even more, you hear? Oh, oh-oh-yo-yo-yo! Mama! Fathers, fathers! Let's get it in the corner. - Maybe you can glue it? - What are you ?! He will come soon? No, he has a meeting, you’ll go to the conservatory tomorrow. So, this same place is completely whole. This place also needs to be removed. Come on, take it! Well! Bring it on! Shove it, shove it into the corner. Bet, bet. No, he’ll notice anyway. It was painfully big. And how did it please you? There wouldn’t be any one to smash. After all, how many I beat them, I’ll put them wider and nothing. - What is it? - These are, so to speak, the thoughts of the artist. Ah, good thoughts. Oh, how many of them. Why are they so small? - And then he makes them big. - Ah... I'll tell him myself. Now I'll bring a broom. Natasha, is that you? Hello. I could not come yesterday. I'm sorry. I waited, but you would have called. - Sorry, that's not all. - Lyuda. - Yes, what do you want? - I still ordered... Meeting? Again? If you heard what they said about me now, you would probably stop loving me. - Ah, pygmies... - Hello. Hello. Yes, Boris has arrived. It seems like they’re going to arrange a car wash for me. I'll tell you later. Boris? I don’t know, I don’t think, we are friends after all. On the contrary, I only hope for him. - Where are you going? - I am? Received came. I realized. You should have come later. And now, go, and the tours have all passed. Home, home. Next year now. - Did Natasha pass? - She comes after us. - Don’t worry, for God's sake. - But I don’t worry. - Why is your hand trembling? - Tours... what's this? Tours then? Tours... But the devil knows them. Tours, yes tours. Well, sort of sifting people through a sieve. Sow, sow, and then turn. Only here, they don’t always stay big either. And you did not have time, and okay. You’ll be healthier! I do not like it here. I thought it would be easier here. Someday I will reach retirement. What is there! In winter, with these fingers, so swoop, you can’t raise your hands. And in the summer - tears. Some here are all faint of heart. Cry... Why cry? They do not understand, therefore they cry. The unfortunate ones are those who stayed here. Talent... After all, look for it... But if hedgehog is not there, have you already taken it? Here you have an unhappy person for life. Why are you silent, huh? Separation from her soul is full of longing... - Get dressed? - You are welcome. - Thank you. - You are welcome. - All the best. - Goodbye. Good luck. - Who is this? - Our professor. - Singing? - Singing. Wait a moment. Wait a minute! Hey wait! - Wait. - You to me? I need to shout: "Hey, Professor Sokolov!" What is your name? What is their name? - Why do you need me? - Yes, that's the main thing that was needed. - I wanted... I need you... - Thank you. - I wanted to... - See a girl, if you are relative to admission, now it's too late. - Late. - Late, the reception is already over. Finished... And if you are on other issues, then tomorrow. - Tomorrow? - Tomorrow. Good luck. And when is it tomorrow? At what time? At six o'clock! At six o'clock! Borka... Can you imagine? Hoping for a friend... The one I trusted unlimitedly suddenly fell upon me as an enemy. He literally stamped my feet as a friend, of course, and with a desire you see save... dying talent. He stated that I defamed the topic of labor. But listen, Kolya, because he used to say... Who is he, after all? Provincial with two or three decent jobs. Arrived... Let's see, see what he can do. He didn’t differ either in discipline or by will, more practicality... - No, Kolya, he used to... - Accused me of being isolated from life, huh ?! He’s everywhere, you know, he’s driving, and I... Yes, why is my work worse? Well, why are you so upset? I am? What are you... But in general... He was very convincing. Hello mother. I send greetings to Kolka, Mane, Katya, Helen and Mishka. Greetings to Uncle Styopa, Aunt Anfisa, Pakseeva Nure and her mother, Daria Ivanovna, Savinov, if they have not left yet. Vale Konevoy, Bolgov big greetings, grandfather Trofimych and Egor, Sanya Sergeyev, and his father, that he brought us hay in the winter. Gavrilina Kate - did she get married or wasn’t she? Gathered before leaving... Aunt Martha was telling a lie No one here is washing the streets with soap. There is asphalt all around, a car is watering the streets. There are many cars and many people. Horror how many people. Go to the back of the head for each other, one in one direction, and the other in the other, without end. And no one says hello. The Kremlin saw. It turns out to be brick made of red brick. I don’t know what to write to myself. There is nothing to write. But of course, I won’t come back. Where have you been? - I walked around the city. - Um. Hm... Of course, we won’t get into the theater now. Well, well, let's go eat something. - Get ready. - Why, looking at the night? Yes, and why go? Here... I have it all. Well, then we will. Now get ready - let's go to the restaurant. - To the restaurant again? - No, I will not go. Come on. He still will not get rid. Okay. I will go. - Are you ready? - Yes. - And Mom’s... a day off? - Nah... - Do not wear? - Nope. Well, let's go. - Good evening, Svetlana. - Hello. - Hello. - Hello, my name is Natasha. - And me Frosya. - Have you met? Yes. Go. - I have a cutlet in Kiev. - What will you be, Frosya? And I only have tea, six glasses. Mom and I always drink tea after the bath with raspberry jam. Or at least... five. Chicken Kiev, steak with blood, chicken, tobacco, something from the snack to your taste, a bottle of dry wine, one hundred and fifty grams of cognac, and... third - then. - What about tea? - Bring it. - Tired? - Not really. In general, you get more tired of meetings than of work. - And you do not go. - You can’t. I am the person in charge. - And Frosya was sad for something. - No. - No? - Good restaurant. Why are these numbers here? - These are the prices. - Prices ?! Let's get out of here. Come along. - Let's go dance, Frosya. - Yes, here it is... No, I won’t go. And look, they’re dancing. Frosya came to conquer the world. Let her be lucky. I drink for you, Frosya. - I do not drink. - It’s a sin not to drink for your happiness. Thank. This one is smaller. Ah, tea! Thank you. Can I have bread? - Drink some wine, Frosya. - No. Let's go home. And then I have to get up early tomorrow. Why is that? I would cook at home. Why get up early? And the professor said that he accepts at six. - So it's evenings. - Yes? Who comes to the institute at six in the morning? Yes, maybe this is not what he said. - Then who? - In vain I came here. In vain. The exams are all over, I was late, too late. Frosy, how late? What are you saying, Frosya? My mother said to me: "Why are you going so far?" And I did not obey. I went. So late. Moreover, I knocked a woman out of you. Which woman? And here, that big one, with a spatula, stood. So... to smithereens. True, she was... But still the same thing. One clay I guess how much went... I... somewhere I saw one. At the station, what... If I could buy, I would buy. Well, who will sell it? You have a lot of them there. Well, what are you, Frosya? Is it worth it because of this upset? So it all worked out together... - Do you want me to go tomorrow? - Where to? In the Institute? No no. If you go there, then I won’t go there anymore. Let's go home. Come along. And in what, will we put all this together? - A little bowl... - Frosya! Well, let it go. We will wait for you. Marya Semyonovna will open it for you, and I will spend Natasha, okay? - Okay. - Goodbye, Frosya. Goodbye. - What are you doing? - I remembered about tea. Six glasses. - I like her. - Me too. There is something... real. And who are her parents? Father died a year and a half ago, was a forester. They lived in the forest with the whole family. They have six children. He did not die, but went hunting and did not return. The bear broke. Now mother is in his place. - You say how she is. - So she told me. The village is eight kilometers away. I went to school every day. Yes... How far she is from everything... And maybe we are far from her. Um... maybe... - Why are you here? - No one opens. Well... I will undress. Ah, Professor Sokolov... Here I am to you... You wanted, no, I wanted... If you are regarding admission, now it's too late. - Late. - Late, the reception is over. - Finished... - All the best. - It is now tomorrow. - What is this to understand, again tomorrow? And you said yesterday when you climbed on a bus. - So I told you everything yesterday? - Yes. Or maybe on another issue? What do you want? - Protrude. - What? - Well, to speak... - To speak? - Oh, I didn’t say that... - Uh, mother, it’s not you who came here. Here is an institute, they are studying here. They come here, they don’t act here. Come next year, we'll see. All the best. Just look, don't be late anymore. Hello. Hello. My name is Konstantin Sergeyevich Stanislavsky. And this is my friend - Nemirovich-Danchenko. Yes... - I heard something about you. - Well, it's natural. Only you are painfully young. We are members of the selection committee. Yes, and here I am, and Vladimir Ivanovich... Are you free now, Vladimir Ivanovich? - Yes, perhaps, perhaps. - So Vladimir Ivanovich is free. - We could listen to you. - Truth? Oh, thanks. - Yes! - Oh, thank you so much. - And you? You are a singer? - Yes? No, I only want more. - To want is to be able! - You see. Well then, let's go? - You are welcome. - I ask you to. - Oh! Here, thank you. - Come in, come in, please. Well, what will you sing to us? - Ah... what is needed? - Are you from Yakutia or directly from the tundra? I am from Yeltsovka. - And what's that? - And this is in Siberia. Ah, then something Siberian, ditties, jokes. Or... You know, there are such songs... - Oh well... - Oh well? - Well, such songs... - What? - Well, some... - Ah! This is probably... Finnish knife, dog... - Stop! Fine. - Not that, huh? Se très joli chanson! (Great song!) Come on, Vladimir Ivanovich will play along with us. He is a great specialist in folklore. I beg! - And where is Frosya? - Getting ready for the second round. Someone is listening to her there. In general, everyone should do what he can, and not what he wants. In vain she came here. And then in our time - Frosya! What it is? Fossil. Stone Age. Funny and wild. On the contrary. This is exactly what you are missing now. - What? - Sincerity. In my library, I often ask the question: "Have you read this?" And if I ask with irony, I almost always get the answer: "Yes!" And why? You see, I didn’t read it. You are doing interesting experiments. Yes. And that's what a person is older... the older he is, the sooner he’s ready to lie, than seeming ignorant. Well, all this requires proof. What, for example, am I lying? - You? - Yes. Well, here, for example, you say one thing to your colleagues, and another thing to me about them. - Right. - And in art... Right. You know, I thought, what if I die today... ... in the evening, huh? What will remain? It? Or that? It has gone. It is mediocre. For this, I have already received everything. It has come. Made a woman with a paddle. Somewhere there is a place where, you see, they cannot do without it. And some bears make rams in marble. My workshop turned into a feeding trough. Look... some dead people are standing. Art must be living, real, so that the soul worries, so that everyone can stand and think. And what's that? Vulgarity, mummers. A miserable fake for the truth. - What happened? - Today I was in Boris’s workshop. He was a secret from him, like a coward. No, I'm not shocked, I'm crushed. All my life I just did that I was going to do something. And Boris... Boris does! This is the truth of life: the same people, the same images? But how are they made... We need to start all over again and honestly. Here the girl gives some kind of funny concerts, have you heard? - Well, sir! I ask you to. - Yes, there she is. Is this something, a lot of so many people have accumulated? Could not do anything. Everyone wants to listen to you. - Yes! - Vladimir Ivanovich, please. - Konstantin Sergeyevich... - Vladimir Ivanovich... - Konstantin Sergeyevich... - Vladimir Ivanovich... - Frosya, please! - Please! I'm not at home. Whoever called. Yeah. Yes? There is none, no. - And I will not know when. - And I will not know when. Some man... - Who's there? - Yes, I am, I am. Come in. Ours, ours, then the second day only: oooh, rrrrrrr! I never saw him like that. Which dog bit him. And you came and sit. Do not poke in there. Maybe he’s angry that you... ruined him. The second round passed. And what about tours? A tour is... sifting people through a sieve. Frosy, come here! Well, go, nothing. Do you like something... here? Like. This one. Yeah. Good. Well? How are you? Konstantin Sergeyevich said that everything will depend on the third round. - Tomorrow. - It's funny, honestly. Well, how can one hope for something? Do you really think that he is serious? Funny, just funny. No, I wish you happiness... of course... Konstantin Sergeyevich, who is this? Who is it? Stanislavsky. Stanislavsky died in 1938. And not knowing this is simply indecent. - Listen, is it you again? - Me again. - This is amazing. - Yes. I do not agree with you, Alexander Alexandrovich, You can teach a donkey to sing! Depends on the teacher. Maybe it’s possible, Marya Gavrilovna, but why? However, I never succeeded. Ah, you are such a joker! Thank you, Alexander Alexandrovich. All the best, bye Marya Gavrilovna. - Hello. - Hello. Hello. Hello. What is this performance? Ah, well! Come with me. - Veronika Vasilievna. - Yes? Can't you give me 10 minutes if you take your time? - Of course, please. - We need to listen to one figure. - I have to! - Well let's go. - Hello. - Hello. - Hello. - Practice, practice. Sorry! Lunch break. - Hello. - Hello. - Hello. - Hello. Well then, dear, time... - Hello, Alexander Alexandrovich. - Hello, and here what? - It should be... listening. - Ah! - But we can concede. - In no case, do it. - We will find a place, I think. - Well, of course. When you lower a note from your forehead, it does not sound. And when you connect the nose with the chest, then it sounds. So I connected the nose with the chest - I have it like a pipe. Wow! From here to here. Hello. Alexander Alexandrovich... Ah, ah! Do you hear? Ahhhhhhhh... My friend, my friend, why are you so broke? After all, classes are going. Sorry. Alexander Alexandrovich, the room is free now. - Do you think it’s free? - We just finished there. - I feel better in the hall. - Well then, let's go to the gym. You are welcome. Well! What will we sing? And what do you say, then we will sing! What do you want then? Yes, I actually do not need anything. You need it, you sing. Just go ahead. Go ahead. - No, it’s better for me here, more convenient. - Well, good, good, start. Russian folk song. "Along the St. Petersburg" Folk music, words, I don’t know whose, probably, also folk.

One hundred different tricks, and certainly And I insist on my own. I'm in front of no one Not orobey And it will be the way I want.

Here, this is completely useless. - Thank you, Veronika Vasilievna. - Wait! Can you sing something out loud? - Can you get it even louder? - Ltd! When I spoke at my club, I heard it on the board. Well, tearing your throat is not a tricky business, everyone can do it. You say, everyone is not everyone at all. - I was singled out for the show alone in the district - What were you doing in the area? What did I do? Sang, what did she do. - And did not scold you? - On the contrary, praised. - Well well well! And so, and praised. - I do not know, admired. - Well, you say, I do not fit? - No, I won’t tell you. - And then, I’m coming up. - That's what... - Come on... - Tomorrow? - Tomorrow? - No, why tomorrow? Day after tomorrow. - An hour at four. Will you find me? - I'll find it. - Good. Come on, Veronika Vasilievna. - Yes goodbye. Goodbye. Well, Burlakova Frosya, be healthy. - Thank you, and you do not get sick. - I will try. It’s not for me to tell you, Alexander Sanych. Late. - Reception is over. - Yes, come tomorrow. - What are you saying? - No, I grumble like an old man. There are no seats. And without a scholarship, we cannot take it. I can’t do anything, even if I wanted to. What is it? We drive around the Union We seek out talents, spend time, spend money. Then a man comes, he comes! Exceptional stuff! We cannot accept him, even if he is at least seven spans in the forehead. Because, you see, late, the reception is over. Renix. - What is a "reenix"? - Nonsense, I say. Nonsense ?! But read it. Just received yesterday. Order... Oooo... It’s easy for you to live, Denis Ivanovich, everything is decided for you. - And, in the end, you answer. - And I answer. - But you can’t do anything. - I can’t do anything. But it’s necessary to do, Denis Ivanovich. But? How? - I don’t know, Alexander Sanych. - M-yes. What are you doing? - What? - But? I wrote a letter. Oh you... On, read it. Write about me, read. Read it! WASTE TALENTS My only job. The work of the third course. She really was made for people. - What are you doing? - They gave a place in the hostel. I will work and study at the institute. - Are you leaving? - Yes. I would wait until I wake up. I would drive you by car. Yes, I’ll go on foot. Why is he still sleeping? Before morning, just fell asleep. I’ll look at the butts... Father! I immediately realized that the night did not sleep. An abnormal person has become. But it was normal. I'll go. Thank you very much. And tell him, thank you very much. - Is it far from the hostel? - You have to go by bus. On the 108th. You won’t get it. Leave at least half. - Nothing. - Stupid you, God grant you health. - Drop in to us. - I'll come back later. - Hello. - Ah, hello. I'm in a hurry very much. What, I need help, probably? Well, let's. Do not... - Where to carry? - To the bus. - So far away. - Yes. - Well, how does the aunt of an egg swallow it? - That the voice sounded? - And you, why, live near here? - Yes, our hostel is here. I’m also moving to the hostel. I was accepted to college today. In which? In the agricultural? - No. - In the construction? No. In the theater, probably. The artist? - Now, after all, everyone goes there, huh? - No. And yes. Well, well, beautiful too. Then you better get a taxi with such things. - Well, Small, with bags in the trunk. - Never mind. Sit down. Goodbye. - Why did it jump out of you? - Where? - Yes, there! - Twenty cents. Already? Wait a minute! Stop it! Well, who does this? Well, who does this? Well, how can you grab the wheel! - Do you have a lot of them? - Only one copy. - Please. - You are welcome. Now I’ll go and call the policeman. Let him rule it will find on you. You are silent. Let me help you. - You arrived quickly. - Yes. Taxis are a good thing! Wait, I need to buy a book. A very necessary book. Can you lend me or do you... have absolutely nothing? - How much do you need? - The ruble is sixty. Turn away. A very necessary book, I've been looking for it for a long time. - I will return it to you tomorrow, I will certainly return it. - Here! - Two rubles. - Thank. - It's time to dine. - And where is Frosya? I ran somewhere in the morning, then came, packed my things and left. They took her to college. - How long has she left? - From half an hour. Boots, look, I forgot my boots. She eco thinks to look for something that broke something from you? The girl is painfully annoying, I noticed. Find some similar. Take and buy. Will not buy. I messed up a little there. You clean, please. - And where to bring the money? To the hostel? - Yes. No, come better to the institute. And when do the lectures end? Three o'clock? Come to the four.

What are you tearing up? Do you think the board of the collective farm will hear you? Voice, mother, this is not a singer yet. Voice is a tool! We must learn to own it. Let's say you win a great piano in the lottery. - Then will you become a pianist? - But do you win? - No, I say if you win? - You won’t win by anything. Mom and I got two tickets. They won nothing. So it would be better if our Mishka bought a hairbrush. You are a dense girl, Burlakova, it’s hard to talk to you. Yes! Let's do it better. You are welcome. My song flies with supplication Quiet at night In the grove light foot You come my friend! When the moon is noisy Leaves at a late hour Leaves at a late hour And no one, oh my dear friend, Won't hear us He will not hear us. Hear in the grove sounded Songs of the Nightingale. Their sounds are full of sadness They pray for me. They understand all the languor, All the longing for love All the longing for love... And inspire tenderness They are on me, They are on me. Give you access You to your soul And on a secret date You come quickly You come soon! Come quickly... - I am listening to you, Denis Ivanovich. - Here's the thing, Alexander Sanych. Some of your... so to speak, students take offense at you. Yes? They are offended that they are not Chaliapins and not Nezhdanov, as I understand it? Prickly you are a man. They are offended that you pay little attention to them. And give more time to your four students. Ah, there you go! And to whom personally, let me ask you? - In particular, this new student. - Clear. Who else do you know? And why do I devote to them, you know? Yes, we know them very well, Alexander Sanych. And I understand that everyone can have their own likes, so to speak, antipathies. - But in the interests of pedagogy... - In the interests of pedagogy of all my students, I would leave only this four at the institute. That would be in the interests of pedagogy. But Alexander Sanych, we must teach them and must educate... I do not want to cultivate mediocrity. I don’t want to understand? Enough of this rotten impartiality! No need to litter our profession. And so... Alexander Sanych... You can not worry, Denis Ivanovich. Within the curriculum I practice with all students equally. - Well, that's great. - Unfortunately... But for additional classes in your free time I challenge those I find necessary. - Here you go! Now everything is clear to me, so to speak. Can I be free? Yes, yes, Alexander Sanych, please. Open. Discover! Burlakova, open immediately! What's going on here? Where to? - What are you doing here? - I am? I walk down the hall, I see a free audience, let me work out a little... Suddenly, you twitch, twitch... What? Out! - Che? As you said? - Out! Get out of college! To the doctor soon! Today you are really... early. Where are we going? Okay. Are you cold? Yes... And the truth is said, you have some kind of artist there, not a sculptor tore all his paintings, drove his wife out of the house, and he left somewhere, he drank there and... lost his mind, right? Some kind of nonsense. With fat people rage. Yes... Do you notice? As soon as we meet, we begin... ... about paintings, about artists, about musicians... Yes, endlessly talk about... vocal cords... it's not interesting. And generally speaking... Well, what do we have in common? You don't even give a damn that I hang around here every time for two hours. I'm waiting... What am I waiting for? Why are you silent? But? What? - Why? - Sore throat. - Voice ripped off. - How? - I took a high note. - What for? What for? What a note ?! So... You and the cold be harmful, probably? Well, go home. Go, go. Frosya. - I ask you to. - Sit. Sit down. - Have you been to the hospital? - Why? No. That is, I was really sick for a very long time. Yes? And now, gradually recovering. - You are so thin. - Unshaven is simple. Does it really matter? But now I have many happy days and nights. - Do you work at night? - Yes. And you have changed. Highly. Absolutely. - Yes? - Yes. May be. I searched for myself for a long time, traveled a lot and worked hard. And it seems to me that I am something... It seems that I found something. But I don’t know if all this is true. You have to look in art, right? You know, an artist cannot stand still. - Come on in. - Alive. - Take this. - Thank you. Come to us, Frosya. - Natasha will be very glad. - I can't. You can’t talk. I'm sick. Ohhh! And I thought you would sing to us. I have never heard you. But let's go sit with us anyway. Today we have a small holiday. I will also be very pleased. Believe me. No, I’ll warn everyone, and the singer will only be silent. Come along. Boris. Already here. No, Sasha, do not pause here. And here: "As I want...", do not accelerate so fast. Sorry, wait a minute. Who's there?! - It's me. - Oh, whom I see! - Burlakova in person. - Hello. Where are you from, dear child? How is the voice? Nothing. The doctor said that you can do. Well, very good. Now we will begin to study a little. - Who do you want? - Can Burlakov? You. Go on. Come back in an hour, let's get started. - You are welcome. - Thank. Frosya, I'm from Kostya. He is leaving today. So, he asked me... - Here, pass it on. - Where to? I don’t know where. To practice, perhaps... He asked, I passed. Kostya! Kostya! Shout, please: "Kostya!" Shout: "Kostya!" "Kostya!" Louder. No, big one... Where to where are you? Get away now from the train. Girl, get away from the train. Kohl love, so without reason... Kohl threaten, so in earnest, Kohl scold, so hot Kohl chop, so much so! If it’s bold to argue, Kohl to punish, so for the matter Kohl forgive, so with all my heart, If the feast, so the feast is mountain! - So how is it? - In my opinion, nothing. - How do you say? - In my opinion, nothing. Nothing. Nothing good. In my opinion, bad. What are you thinking today? - I dont know. - So I do not know. And you need to think about what you are singing about. We must live with these thoughts, this music! Put the suitcase down! You came here to study, and take the trouble to work like a horse! You can not, do not want to - leave! The time of easy successes has passed. It will pass soon, it must pass. - Clear? - Clear. What, are you in any kind of trouble? Yes... I will ask all over again. THE END OF THE FILM
