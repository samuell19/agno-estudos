- Good morning, Mr. Martelli. - Morning. Fill her up. - Very well. L'ASSASSINO aka 'The Lady Killer' Hello? Oh, it's you. I'm still in bed. Yes, I'm better now. I've slept ten hours straight. Now I'll take a bath and head for Lucca. I just needed a good sleep. I don't know whether to drive or go by train. Yes... of course. Of course, darling... But you'll see... Hello?! You'll marry a man who's worn-out. I'll ring you as soon as I get to Lucca. Yes, I love you. Now go back to sleep. Sir... This is the car. The engine's still warm. - Where is he? - Those are his windows. Please don't make a mess. - Are you the janitor? - Yes, why? - Listen here... - Do you know this guy? - That's Marcus Aurelius. - No, this one. - That's Mr. Alfredo Martelli. Take the lift to the third floor. But who are you? - Good morning. - Good morning. - Martelli, the antiques dealer? - Yes. - I'm Margiotta. Pleased to meet you. Sorry, but I didn't expect customers so early. Please come in. Don't stay by the door. There's a lot of you. Are you from a company? I guess you've been to my shop. But I keep my favourite pieces here at home. Come in. I was burning the tips of my hair. A remedy against hair loss. Do come in. Browse around while I dress. - We're in a hurry. - Are you Sicilian? Agrigento, Taormina... Beautiful places. - But we've settled in Rome. - A long time ago? We're from San Vitale Police Headquarters. About time the police cared about their decor! I bet there's a lot of work to do. As a single man, I have to rely on my housemaid... Let's see where... Sir... that's my bedroom. It's not for sale. Excuse me, Sir... - What are you doing? - Going away, eh? - I can leave any time. - Then stay with us a while. - Why should I? - You'll find out later. You'd better come to Headquarters. Of course. Why not? No! Let's have a chat here. I'll order coffee and croissants. No, you'll have to come with me. May I? - Tell me what this is about. - I'm not allowed to. But I have to go to Lucca... Besides, where's the thing... I mean, the warrant? Don't worry, it's all legal. Do you realise you can't carry out a search? We have a warrant. Get dressed and follow us. I'm not taking orders from you. In fact, I'm going back to bed. It won't take more than half an hour. - Does it worry you? - No, my conscience is clear. You know what? You won't force me out of here. After you. Please, after you. They showed me a photo... I had no choice but to confirm it was him. Here they come! Make sure Mr. Martelli never finds out... - Good morning. - Good morning. - What's happened? - Where are they taking him? - Here they come. - I'd better go. Please, be patient. Go with him. - Let's go. - Where? Make yourself comfortable. Please don't move from this room. - He's here. - Really? - Keep him waiting. - Okay. Listen, can't I walk up and down the corridor? Why are you so keen to visit our offices? Inspector Palumbo... Inspector Palumbo... I'm Alfredo Martelli. - Who cares? - What a nerve! Where's he gone? That guy insulted me! That's an abuse of power. - Easy... - Easy, my foot! I've put up with this long enough. I don't believe this! Being dragged here as if I were a murderer. You'll sort it out with the Inspector. I guess he has priority over my shop. Do you know how much I can miss out on in an hour? Millions... They'd never understand how I earn a living. An honest living... Where are you taking me? - I could be tailed. - What have I got myself into?! Give me a hand. - Still a Party member? - No, no more politics. - Still voting for us? - Of course. - Who's this guy? - The son of the late Cesare. Hi, there. You shouldn't trust anyone who comes around. You've got the best bed in the house! Water in his belly. I doubt he'll survive Christmas. Meanwhile, I have to look after him. - That's why I'm selling. - It's all rubbish. Steal something better. I'd rob the Central Bank, but I haven't got the training. I've been too busy working. - Is he taking oil? - He needs an undertaker. - Who's this other guy? - The same guy as before. - There's nothing here. - Have a good look around. What's the matter with him? - He's off his rocker. - I can see that. - What's this? - A clock. I can see that myself. Where did you get it? I delivered some coal to an old countess. - She refused to pay me. - You got the clock instead? - Yes, plus a knock on the head. - You hit her? - Why not? - How much? - It's up to you. 4000 maximum, just to help you out. Aleandro, we got 4,000 for the clock. Is that another guy? Why is everyone queuing up at the door? - Take him to a home. - He doesn't want to go. Lend a hand. We said 4,000, didn't we? It's still cheap. What if he carks it? You're right... Hold this. Here's 5,000. Have a drink on me. If anything happens, don't call me, I'll call you. Nice clock. What period is it? 19th century, lmperial. Gilded... Well-sculpted figures, plus a very unique sound. - How much? - 150,000 lire. Mr. Martelli... Watch your manners. Well? I'm Palumbo. Your name rings a bell. From time to time we end up in the papers. Actually, someone kept calling out your name. My dear Martelli, that's not unusual around here. This is a lousy job... In here, you feel like an inmate. You're right - I don't even know why I'm here. - Sit down. - Thanks. - Do sit down. Unfortunately, the cops here are 50 years behind the times. They think anyone coming here is at least a murderer. Go on, leave us alone. A lousy job, my dear Martelli. It's a question of attitude. They can't tell a decent person from a crook. - I thought so... - Actually, it's more than that. It's not just a matter of being competent. The issue is much more important than that. Of course. It's a constitutional issue. We must acknowledge that enquiries must comply with certain basic freedoms. Obviously. So... you're an antiques dealer. Yes, I have a shop near the Spanish Steps. - Do you own the shop? - I do now. - And before? I was in partnership with a lady. Mrs. De Matteis, who's now restoring the Sangri-La Hotel. - De Matteis... Did you say De Matteis? - Yes. You've had the shop how long? It must be five or six years. - What were you before? - Still an antiques dealer. I had a smaller shop on the Via dei Coronari. So as not to be disturbed. - Rag-and-bone trade? - No, just a smaller shop. Antique furniture wasn't so trendy at the time. Check out the Via dei Coronari. - An antiques dealer, eh? - Correct. A nice business. I almost envy you. I did quite a few jobs before that. - I even attended acting classes at the film school. - Oh, really? - Are you married? - No. - Engaged? - Yes. - Who to? - Do I really have to... - I'm afraid so. To Miss Nicoletta Nogaro. The daughter of the industrialist... Nogaro, the pharmaceuticals manufacturer. Are you officially engaged? Of course. We're to be married this year. Inspector Palumbo... Inspector Palumbo! Would you kindly explain why I'm here? My dear Martelli, show some patience. This is a complicated case. We can't just rush through it. We must understand who you really are... go over your whole life. - You're from a family of anarchists, right? - Me?! Your grandfather was an anti-fascist. - Is that a crime? - It was back then. - Back when? - When Fascism ruled... Grandpa, the fascists are after you. They'll give you a hiding. Go home. I'll take care of it. I did warn you... Boy, were you scared! I was only joking. Mind you, Inspector, I'm proud of my grandfather. He was the only genuine anti-fascist in his village. You're often in trouble for not honouring your bills. It happens when you run a business. - What's that got to do with it? - Don't worry. - I said it was a lengthy case. - How long? - It depends. Then I'll have to make a call. I should have been in Lucca by now. - Who are you calling? - Mrs. Adalgisa De Matteis. I have unfinished business with her. - Go ahead. - Thank you. Hello, Sangri-La Hotel? Get me Adalgisa. It's Alfredo Martelli... That's none of your business! Inspector Palumbo speaking. It's all right. I know you want to leave me. You can spare me all your stories. You're a cheat, that's what. A cheat. You always were. Go on, say you don't need me anymore. Did you think I didn't know? You don't need me anymore. You used me to climb out of the slums. Without me, you'd still be a rag-and-bone man... the poor wretch you were and still are. You don't remember that, do you? Go away! Get out of my sight! I'll kill myself, because I've got the guts to do it. First you should soak your wrists in warm water. How did it happen? Just try to calm down. By the way... a few minutes ago, you tore up a business card. What business card? You took a business card from your jacket. You tore it up and threw it in a vase like this. Then you changed your mind and took it back. Yes, it's just a silly thing. Here. I can't believe she's dead. I can't believe it. "Martelli, Accountant." Why did you tear it up? Is that important? From now on, everything may be important for you. I'm not an accountant, but... to make my mother happy... I told her I'd got my certificate. So she had these made up by the local printer. A long time ago... Then she died. Then I thought... I could be had up for false pretences... It's weird, I know. As you know too well, Mrs. De Matteis was murdered. Murdered?! Are you mad? Now do you realise you're in trouble? We know you were the last person to see her... last night, at her hotel in Tor San Lorenzo. Yes, I went to see her, but... That's all I know. - Were you her lover? - Of course. Everybody knows that. Mind you, our love affair was virtually over. All my friends know that. In the past few months, I saw her only two or three times. Murdered... Then why did you see her last night? Wait... Hold it right there. You're getting it all wrong. I can assure you... I give you my word of honour. - Did you kill her? - No! Did you leave her dead or alive? Dead... I mean, alive! Don't try to confuse me. You're the one who's panicking. I spoke to Mr. Nogaro, the fiancee's father. The girl's been missing since this morning. All right. So it was Adalgisa De Matteis who financed your new shop. Yes, she loved me. - No harm in that. - Did you love her? Coming to see the Roman ships? It's a waste of time. We're going back to Rome. - Bye, Nicoletta. - Bye. - Staying with us, Nicoletta? - But you have company. In your case, three isn't a crowd. - Sure I'm not disturbing you? - Not at all. - No... - Then I'll come with you. - Who's that dumb broad? - Alfredo! Don't you play dumb. You know she's filthy rich. Why did the Germans destroy these Roman ships? Because they're Germans. Why such big ships on such a small lake? The Emperor kept them there just to make love on them. Day and night. Night and day. Just to make love on them. Have you ever made love on a boat? - I've never tried. - Would you like to? I love going out on boats... The same goes for making love. Adalgisa doesn't like it. She gets seasick. It's not just boats. Many things make me sick. I know... Those bronze strips strengthened the ships' sides. To protect them. They're like abstract paintings. - So your name's Nicoletta. - Yes. Those Romans sure had big hands! You seem to be enjoying each other's company. Yes, I'm really having fun. Adalgisa... Don't tell me you're even jealous of silly girls. Can't you see she's just a twit? Why? I like her. She's young, nice and rich. I'm going for a drive. I feel like being alone. You stay with her. Well? Aren't you happy? When you're like this, you offend me. Okay, go for a drive. - What's happened? - Nothing. She's a strange woman. Were you in love with her? Answer me. Were you in love? - Yes, very much. - Then why did you split up? Many reasons. It's not that simple. A relationship can end just like that. - It was she who left me. - Here. - She was older than you. - That's right. - She must have been jealous. - Yes, she was. Yet she was pushing me to marry a younger woman. I see... Dear Martelli, you're an enviable man. I understand you made her suffer. She didn't need any special reason to be unhappy. And you made sure she had plenty of reasons... to the point where she had to leave you. After all, your shop was well established. - I won't even answer that. - Of course. Miss Nogaro is wealthier than the deceased, isn't she? Mrs. De Matteis was starting to hinder your plan. I loved Adalgisa, not her money. That's it. That's enough. I'm neither a pimp, nor a criminal. I feel tired and ill. After all, it wasn't some dog that was killed. Bring the gentleman in. Inspector Palumbo, I want to go home. I really loved Adalgisa. If you think I just wanted to use her, then you're wrong. Besides, I feel ill. Call someone, do something. I'm not staying here! I'm not staying here. That's it. So you're Mr. Morello, the husband of the deceased. Do you know each other? If you believe him, then what's the use? - He's got it in for me. - How do you know? - I know your intentions. - Come. You'd like to see me dead. You even hated Adalgisa. - Sit down. - Don't believe what he says. He has a vested interest in accusing me. - You know each other well. - We used to be close friends. - And now? - Obviously not. - How long since you saw him last? - Five years. A strange friendship... You know very well I didn't run away with your wife. - I even wrote to you. - I didn't open the letter. You used my position to widen your network of contacts. He pretended he was a friend... I even begged her on my knees. "Adalgisa, I beg you. Don't leave me." All to no avail. She's moved into a hotel. It all went smoothly for eight years. She won't tell me why she did it. She might be in love with another man. You talk to her. She'll listen to you. Find out what she wants, what she's missing. See if she wants to travel. She can't keep living in a hotel here in Rome. I love her. Besides, there's my reputation. Don't blame me. It was he who insisted. After all, he's a friend. He worries me, you know. This is an important decision. Have you thought it over? Thinking... always thinking. I'm tired of thinking. I'm tired of the same old faces, the same old friends. You're no longer a spring chicken - you must know the consequences. Listen... What are you going to do? I'll go into business. Set up a fashion house... Do you have another man? Adalgisa... I'd rather not be here right now. Something funny is happening to me. I desperately feel like kissing you. Don't be childish! - Alfredo... Alfredo! - Yes? You see, Alfredo... I can't stop half-way. If I start something, I go all the way. Adalgisa... I never imagined it would come to this. What a funny hairdo! I've had it since I was a kid. Is that you, Morello? Yes, I've spoken to her... She's here. Don't worry. It's all taken care of... You're not engaged. The girl's father doesn't even know you. - I don't know him either. - You lied. You said you were getting married. Yes, I lied. It wasn't any of your business. We agreed to marry. Her father will know in time. The girl's been missing since this morning. - "Missing"? - That's right. Did you live in this suburb for long? Yes, but I haven't been back for 10 years. - Why? - Because it's sad. My father died here and Mum went back to her village. It brings back bad memories. There's the murderer... Move it... Clear out. Come on. This way. Did they find her in the gazebo? Why did you sell part of the hotel to her? I'd overstretched myself extending it. And how much did Mrs. De Matteis contribute? 30-40 million, I think. She paid off my debts... and became the owner of most of the hotel. After all, she saved me from bankruptcy. Would you mind repeating why you visited her last night? I already told you. I needed a loan. Of course... I needed a couple of million for a small restaurant nearby. Something that would let me make a fresh start. When was she supposed to give you the loan? Today or tomorrow. She promised it to me a week ago. Why did you see her last night? I'm always around here directing work. - I'm a partner and part-owner. - I see. Was she alone when you got there? - No, she was with someone. - That was me. The weather's clearing up... Dear me... Let's try to speed things up. Did you hear what happened? Who is she? Tell her to go away. Do I really have to go in? I didn't even see my mother after she died. The body's already been taken away. I say! Nice place. Mrs. De Matteis must have been a strange woman... slightly eccentric. She liked beautiful things. Perhaps lately she had been a bit strange. This was the first room she renovated when she bought the hotel. - Really? - Poor Adalgisa... Poor Adalgisa, you say... She was so happy... Maurice, come here! Good boy... He sensed his master was here. This is Maurice, the dog I told you about. Last night I was going to take you with me. What do you expect? That I keep your dog to satisfy your selfishness? Here comes the list of grudges... You'll start with the dog and end with the bills. You, again! Sorry to bother you, but I must insist. I said it would be all right. It's just that I need that money urgently. Look, right now I'm busy. I can try later. I'd hate to miss out on this bargain. It could be a matter of hours. Even minutes. If it's so urgent, you could try someone else. I'll see you at the usual time tomorrow morning at the site. Goodbye. Do you expect me to believe you came here just for the dog? Right? I was surprised too when she rang, but I did come because of the dog. I swear it. She wanted me to take him back. Maybe he reminded her of an uneasy past... or maybe it was an excuse to see me again. She knew how fond I was of the dog. This is the first room I've renovated to live in. - Do you like it? - Nice. Listen... Don't tell me you asked me here just because of the dog. No, it's not just the dog. I heard you don't have the money to pay me back for those bills due tomorrow. Anyway, you needn't worry. You're too kind. I was going to ask you for an extension. I've brought you this watch. - Why? - Because. Because I care about you. It's become a sort of habit with me. Besides, I haven't seen you in quite a while. Come here. See how I still love you? Whereas you... with that handsome waiter... Why are you like that? I like him. Weren't you a bit like him? It's natural to have a weakness for youth. Why are you surprised? When I think about you and Nicoletta... I feel happy. You may not believe me, but when I'm with Nicoletta, I feel as if I'm cheating on you. That's why I like you. You still believe in loyalty. Whereas it's lust alone that guides us in our actions. Marry her. Get me Mrs. De Matteis' waiter. The dog... that's all we need. You take care of the dog. Come over here. Now... Tell me something: Did you see this man leave? No, I saw him when he arrived. Did you hear that, Martelli? Listen to me... Who gave you this? She did. "Adalgisa, Lose Me Not." - Hardly unique. - I know. I'm not suggesting it was you. Anyone could have done it. He was in Rome, whereas you were right here. Now go. - Don't you agree? - I guess so. But if he saw me, it means he was here too. After you got here, he went to Rome. We've checked it out. How come I'm the only one who can't have an alibi? Let's not forget that Adalgisa... I'm not being cynical, I'm just defending myself... After we broke up, she was fair game for anyone who'd dare. So, why not last night too? Last night, eh? Let's leave it at that. Palumbo... Why don't you listen to me and clear this up, once and for all? What do you mean? What is there to clean up? - You claim that last night you came here... - True. And that you had intercourse so that she'd keep the dog. It may seem ridiculous to you, but it's the truth. Last night you had a fight over these bills, which were due today. Not at all. We did not have any fight. You even put on an act, phoning from my office. I was ringing her to buy out her share of the shop, actually. - Do you have that money? - Of course I do. Not much in the bank, but a lot of credits to collect. - Credits, eh? - Yes, sir. Only you were to gain with these bills gone! Not true. Adalgisa must have torn them up. She was strange at times. Maybe a fit of generosity... - Were you back together? - No. What was the last thing you talked about? We talked about my prospects of marrying Nicoletta. Adalgisa realised our romance was over. Maybe she thought that if I married a woman, who in her eyes posed no threat, our affair could continue after my marriage. Thus risking your marriage of convenience. That's not true. - When did you leave her? - While she was asleep. - She looked like she was. - She was asleep! No... She was dead. You know... I really don't have the money. What they told you is correct. You see, all I need... is a month's extension. - I'm working on a deal... - Aren't you silly! I hadn't even lodged them with the bank. I thought so. - Where's the knife? - What knife? Where did you hide it? I ate it. I used to work in a circus. Very funny. Where did you hide it? I have an aversion to knives. Guns and poison are okay, but knives are out. You're almost 35. A grown-up man. - And tired too. - Come with me. Come on, move. - So you're refusing to help us? - That's right. I'm prepared to go to jail. But only for resisting arrest! Fair enough. Let them take a sniff of him. - What are you doing? - Hurry. Stand still. Don't move. I'm cold. May I have a blanket? Actually, I'm hot. Go and have some coffee. You! Bring some coffee. - Has Nicoletta been found? - No. You don't like me, do you? Frankly, no. I don't understand weird people like you. Is it clean? So you regard any self-made people as weird. Anyway, you have nothing to worry about. I'm unbiased. What a lovely sunset. Do you prefer the dawn or sunset? - Dawn, definitely. - Of course. - Listen, Palumbo... - What? They said the dog was barking when Adalgisa was killed. That proves my innocence. That dog would never bark at me. - If you fought with its owner? - No. I'm positive. - Want to bet? - This isn't the time. - Let's try it. - Leave me alone. - That dog won't bark. - You, come here. Where is it? Find that dog. Who's got the boss' dog? Maurice! No, not here. On the other side. In the bathroom, where she was found dead. You'll pretend to stab the young lady. Make sure you scream. Scream loudly! Okay? Come on. He might bark if he sees you. Okay, close them. Give me a break! Can't you see it's me? Then you're an idiot, too. Maurice... Incredible! - He's just playing, Inspector. - Sounds like barking to me! But... Palumbo... What do you reckon that dog's doing? - Barking. - He's just being friendly. He may be upset over his owner's death. - You asked for it. - I have to prove it wasn't me! - Inspector! - Palumbo, don't go away. - Our dogs found this. - What is it? - Stale bread. - The builders saw a vagrant. - A vagrant? - A man in the garden. Try to find him. Get Martelli. Come with us, Martelli. Find that vagrant. He could be the murderer. Inspector... It wasn't him. He's always been kind to me. Good. - Alfredo... - Go inside; it's cold. Inspector! Believe me, this girls' crazy. What is it now? I worked as his maid. He treated me like a daughter. He had a doctor see me almost every day. I see. Very good. - He's innocent. - I'm sure he is. Inspector... Why won't you listen to me? - I killed her. - Get lost! - I'm the murderer. - Let's go. - After you. - Hurry up. My boss is innocent. Alfredo is innocent. - Even with your maids, eh? - What do you think I am? Then why did you fire her? - Adalgisa needed her. - She was jealous. She'd never be jealous of a maid... Why is she so keen on you? Because she's simple and I treated her well. - We'll check it out. - Go ahead. Sign here. Thank you. Now follow me. Carmelo! Here. - This is it. - Where's the bed? Over there. I want pyjamas. Quiet. Go to sleep! What's the time? Why? Will you be late for an appointment? I want to talk to my lawyer. And I want mineral water. I can pay for it. Hey, this isn't a train carriage! Is there a toilet here? Or is that an extra? Well? May I have a cigarette? A match, please. Thanks. Thanks... It's freezing in here... They're all against me. Not one of them believes in my innocence. Except Rosa. She's the only one. But why accuse herself of the murder? How silly! Carletto, are you in a daze? - Have you ever... - No, never with maids. If I had one like that, as soon as I got home, I'd lock the door. Would you like to see her naked? - I'd love to. - How about a career change? Rosa, how's your finger? - More or less the same. - Show it to the doctor. Right... This should be treated, you know. Show me your foot. Do you have blood circulation problems? - I don't know. - Let the doctor examine you. I'm embarrassed. Aren't you undressing? - A cigarette! Want one too? - Yes. - Make it two. He must have spotted our candles burning. Shut your face and give me a smoke. We have guests. Good evening. Definitely the candles, or else a tip-off. - Yes, a tip-off. - Shut your face. Have you just come from the outside? We're not talking to you. With a face like yours, I'd be mad to. - He's a police informer. - Are you crazy? No, you're wrong. He doesn't have that look. - What's your name? - Martelli, why? - Martelli? - So? You're the one who killed the old bag. - Four stab wounds... - Yes, the photo! What photo? In today's paper your photo was this big. You were the guy on the right. Now I recognise you. - Show me your face. - Hands off! The old bag, the photo... What do you want? I was reading about you when I was arrested. You've sure had an eventful life! But you disappoint me. All that for an old bag. Martelli... Sex or robbery? - Cut it out. - That was the headline. Anyway, if the murder wasn't the result of a conspiracy... or a robbery... - What's your name? - Martelli! You're a smart guy. You're better off confessing. - Confess, it's better for you. - He's right. You can claim you were jealous... and that she was cheating on you. Cop this, you bitch! Mind your own business. I have nothing to confess. In that case, shut up and sleep. When they come for you, you'll wake up anyway. - Who's going to come? - Who do you think, Martelli? From now on, they'll turn you inside-out. What do you mean? They'll get you to talk and remember things. They'll ask you all about any contacts you have. And you can't lie. They'll probe for anything. They'll question everyone who knows you. Shove off! I taught him in primary school. He was a gifted kid, but also a bit of a rascal. He gave his mother so many heart attacks... When he moved into the building... all the light bulbs started disappearing. I forgot to tell you something. One day they killed Pippo. - Who's Pippo? - My cat. I immediately suspected him, because he couldn't stand Pippo. He was the first to try a Marlon Brando cut. Crazy! Alfredo at film school? Give me a break! I got him a job as an extra. He had to say one line. Instead of "He died last month," he said "He monthed last die." We were conscripts together. He was obsessed with knives and bayonets. He threw them into the doors. One day he just missed the sergeant. "Good riddance," he said. He was so cynical. He had a shop across the road from mine. Mine was a fine shop. Martelli called it competition. In my book, it was theft. Not to mention the rumours he spread. He even said I was a poof... He destroyed me. Of course these paintings are fakes. - Everyone does it. - What does Martelli pay? 50,000 lire a month for 50 paintings. - Then he makes a profit. - How? - He sells them to Americans. - Martelli exploits him. - Fakes should be reported. - But I can't afford originals. Look how well it's done. Besides, he's such a likeable fellow. He's the only exciting man in Rome. - The one on the left. - Hey, you! Now it's my turn. But I get all mixed up. - They can trick you. - Move! I'm scared. I'm going to talk. I'll spill the beans. Did you know they use the cross-fire technique? "Cross-fire"? All of them questioning you at once. Cut it out! Shove off! It wasn't me who killed him. We just wanted to take some sleepers. Then the guard came up holding a lamp. He saw us. You killed a man? I don't know. Maybe... A river of blood... A black river! It was him. That friend of mine. He hit him on the head with a sleeper. - Blood isn't red, you know. - So what? It's pitch black. Help me... Help me! Get lost, you scum! - Come on. - Where are you taking me? Don't worry. We all care about you. - Come on. - Go. Come on. Hey, got a smoke? Sit down. Relax... Do sit down. Are you hungry? No. Did you know Mrs. De Matteis was pregnant? No. How long since you last had intercourse? - I've already told Palumbo. - Tell us too. One year, more or less. And last night? - That's right. - What do you mean? What I meant to say is that between the two of us... there was a special relationship... We were very close, but that didn't mean... - Martelli, get to the point. - But this is my style! Excuse me... You gave this watch to Mrs. De Matteis, didn't you? - Yes. - When? Last night. When you arrived or left? Was anyone present? - Look... - Answer me. Shortly after I got there. We were alone. Thank you. Sounds logical, doesn't it? We found this heel in your car. It belonged to the victim. You're lying. This proves you'd been seeing her lately. Some things have been in my car for years. It doesn't matter. Keep going. - About what? - Your sexual relationship. I was saying... I'm tired. I can make love to a woman... without feeling committed to her. Without a moral engagement, so to speak. But not if she gets pregnant. That's why you killed her. I can't take anymore. Alfredo! Nicoletta! Nicoletta... Why bring her into this? - What have they done to you? - Nothing. I was worried about you. Where have you been? Miss Nogaro, why didn't you meet Mr. Martelli last night? He wasn't well, so he went to bed. Please sit down. How can you be so sure? He told me. I'm sorry, Nicoletta. I feel so embarrassed. At last someone believes you. Now you know the facts, what do you think of him? - He probably had a reason. - Yes, an urgent call. Why did you run away from home today? To avoid arguing with my father. So your father doesn't approve of your engagement? - That's my business. - Why were you at the paper? - What paper? - They'd asked me for a photo. This one in your swimsuit? I hadn't seen it published in the paper. - Nice... but why? - That's enough. Don't worry. It mentions you as well. Miss Nogaro, you may go. Things will sort themselves out. I believe in your innocence. - Please, Miss... - Go now. They'll release you soon, you'll see. Miss... - Why are you here? - Your father's downstairs. We're taking you to the airport. They want you to leave. I'm far from perfect. Quite the opposite. I have many stains on my conscience. I'm not ashamed to tell you. In these last few hours... I've realised just that. To achieve wealth... to satisfy my selfishness... I took a few shortcuts. We figured that out. For example, you see... You said this heel wasn't really important. - To me it is. - What do you mean? It brings back memories... Something I still feel guilty about. It was selfishness, or indifference... Adalgisa happened to be there too... Stop. What is it? An accident? - Let's have a look. - Someone's dead. Wake up. Can you believe it? He needs a sniff of vinegar. You're all witnesses, right? - I saw nothing. - He wanted to commit suicide. He threw himself into my path. You saw that. Come back here. He's driven off... - Luckily I was going slowly. - Adalgisa... - Come here. - He was walking slowly... He jumped in front of me and I hit the brakes. We need a doctor. He could be serious. Look at him. There's no blood or anything. He opened one eye. I saw him. So you're not unconscious. He must be drunk. What are you up to? Do you want to destroy me? He's faking. Nonsense. He's in bad shape. He's just blind drunk. It was his fault... I don't believe it! That guy's a nutcase! - So? - We can't just let him go. What do you want to do? He was acting. Did you see him open one eye? What does that prove? If he weren't acting, he'd have opened both. Let's go. Why jump under a truck at 2 in the morning? Any time's a good time to cash an insurance premium. Let's go home and sleep. I'll drive. Spare me your cynicism. Did you expect him to die to prove his good faith? Let's go, Adalgisa. It's late. Damn it! My heel's snapped. There you go. - Let's follow him. - Stop being a do-gooder. I beg you. - I'll give him some money. - So he can drink it. Stop it. - There he is. - Look at him stumble along. - He won't move. - Blow on the horn. Slow down, you'll scare him. Here's 10,000 lire. Take it. Come here. He's too proud. - Where are you going? - What? You scared him off. Reverse and catch up with him. I guess it's a nice game. Let's play it all the way. Why don't we adopt him? He's a pretty face. Someone jumped off the bridge! I don't believe it. It's the same guy. He managed to kill himself. He wasn't drunk, after all. Poor devil... So, what's your point? Maybe I could have helped him. He was probably just a lunatic. Martelli, save your breath and confess. Here's our old Martelli. Just think, we could spend our lives together. From Regina Coeli Gaol to Porto Longone Penitentiary... and finally to Procida Island Prison. A life full of excitement. The wardens help you off trains, take care of you... You become a sort of public servant. See? We've confessed. - We got it off our chests. - Leave me alone. Now they treat us like true gentlemen. Look, Martelli. They even gave us cigarettes. Want one? - Have you got 50,000 lire? - Leave me alone. I'm tired. You can buy an alibi. The night you killed her... say you were staying at the Hotel Aurora. Shut your filthy mouth! Cut it out! You just write a note... telling them to hand me the money. "I'm in trouble. I need it to get out of jail." Get lost! Open up! - You're a murderer. - Confess! There's no way out for you. You have to confess. - Confess! - You're a murderer! You have blood on your hands, just like us. Confess! What are you waiting for? Let me out. - Open up. - Martelli wants to confess. Warden, open up! Let me out... I want to confess. - I'll confess. Bastards... - Take him away. Hear that? - The trams are running. - It's a new day. - So? - So what? I have nothing to confess. Okay, I did tear up the bills, but I didn't kill Adalgisa, believe me. And move me to another cell, or anything could happen. - I'll do something silly. - Take him away. - Cigarette? - No. Mr. Martelli... Don't tell me you're still here! I can't take anymore. This has been the worst day of my life. I've got such confusion in my head! I'm here because of you, did you know that? Because of me? Why? Because of the watch. I claimed that when Adalgisa came to the door... she had on the antique watch you gave to her. Whereas you told the police... that you gave it to her after I'd left. I told the truth... Are you sure? I no longer know what I'm sure about. Anyway, don't worry. It's my scalp they're after. Yes, but in the meantime I'm being held here too. It doesn't worry me, but it's my mother... She's very old, almost 80. Give her a shock like this and she's history. Because I'm a sentimental guy. I never even got married, as a sign of respect to her. But such feelings no longer exist. Go on, answer. You must take care of your business. Let it ring. It could be important. Hello... Who? My mother's in Rome? Why didn't she call? She's afraid? My mother's in Rome; I must see her. - How are you? - I'm well. Why didn't you call me? The coach trip and all... You're no spring chicken. Rome's changed so much in 10 years! Yes, it's changed. - I visited your father's tomb. - That's good. Look... Let's go somewhere else. - Will you show me your place? - We'll see. This suitcase weighs a ton. What have you got in here? Fit for a trip to America! Alfredo... I came to see your place... and we've ended up eating out, like two gypsies. - I would have cooked for you. - I have builders in the house. There's no kitchen, no chairs to sit on. When it's finished... That's if I ever come again. I'm old, you know. I don't think I'll make it. - Want some lobster? - No, save the money. Go on, eat up. - Aren't you eating? - I'm not hungry. See, Alfredo? Night's fallen already. We'll go now. Hurry. Get on the coach. Go on. It's only a three-hour drive. Why don't you visit me? You and your lectures... You know how busy I am. When I settle down, I'll come and visit you. Give me a kiss. Bye. Look after yourself. What now? It's not working. Go and sit down. Wake up. Come on. Let's go. Come with me. - Not again! - Come on. No, leave the blanket there. Come on. - Sign here, please. - Where are you taking me? Home. You're free. - Free? - Yes. Free. - You mean, really free? - Yes. Having been refused a loan, and feeling he had been cheating by her, he waited for Martelli to leave the hotel. What gave his game away? He's no longer with it. Or it wouldn't have been easy. We only had vague clues. It could have been anyone. It's such a strange world... A woman with such a complicated life... How did you catch him out? - His version about the watch. - Can we take a shot of him? Yes, bring him here. She wasn't wearing a watch when she first spoke to him. He saw it later that night, when he went back to demand the loan. By then Martelli had left. After she offended him, being a megalomaniac and a lunatic, he killed her. Dead! The blood-stained knife was still in his kitchen. Go on now. Make it snappy! Quickly. That's enough. Stop it. That's enough. Try to understand. That's enough. Your time is up. No, not me. This is nothing to do with me. What about Martelli? Martelli... He's a decent lad. Hey... Are you hungry? Here. Have it all. A coffee. - That's that antiques dealer. - He must have been released. Only today, after one year, have I been able to speak about that day. And to you, of all people. A sense of embarrassment kept me from discussing it earlier. On my release, I had only one goal... To change my ways, Nicoletta. And have you changed? A year has gone by, and yet... I'm no longer myself. I feel the burden of my responsibilities. Even now, you see... towards you, Nicoletta... I feel a sense of guilt. For bringing you to places like this, for our clandestine meetings... I'd like to offer you only what is beautiful. It's depressing, believe me. That murderer was right. Such feelings no longer exist. We're just animals, darling. What are we supposed to do? Hold me tight, darling. If you'd looked for me earlier, by now we'd be husband and wife. Listen, Alfredo... - There's something I have to tell you. - What? Before coming here, I told my husband all about us. Nicoletta... Nicoletta... Why did you do that? Why do you women have this lust for clarity, this eagerness for morality? Now there are three of us who are suffering. What good is that? Nicoletta... Didn't we have enough complications, enough scruples? I lied to you. I didn't tell my husband anything. Bye. Nicoletta! Hello... Bornicchia car dealers? Yes... Yes, I tried it. It seems to be all right. But I'm not so keen on the design. Half-American, half-ltalian... No... How much is it, anyway? What? Hold on... Do you know who you're talking to? The lady killer!
