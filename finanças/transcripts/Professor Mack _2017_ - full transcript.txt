Enjoy your winter break, and some of you I'll be seeing next semester in my math statistics class. Enjoy! Bye. Enjoy. You, uh, you will be teaching the statistics class, right? Last I checked, yeah. - I'm in. - Good. - I think we're all in. - Good. Speak for yourself. - Go ahead on. - Hater. No, enough of that. - Oh, okay. - I don't see nothin' to hate on. Yeah, okay. - You guys enjoy. - Wait, I... Okay, babe. Enjoy. Hey, beauty. Oh, her eyes cut into your soul. Girl, she is a child. What is up with her? - I know, right? - Might be a little stalker. - I think so. - Oh, God. So let's go out tonight and get turned up and party. - I'm ready. - You ready? I'm ready. Suits and cologne, baby. Uh-uh. Drinks, and maybe dancing. All right, but you're gonna let me have some fun. Come on, please, don't be that Rosalyn tonight. - Oh, come on, what-- - They're-- Ros, they are not ready. And despite how long I've known you, neither am I. Well, I need you to get ready 'cause we about to turn it up. - Okay. - Okay? - Yes! - What are you wearing? Something cute and sexy. Okay. I'll have to match that. - I'm gonna go grade these papers. - All right, baby. Real good music here. So what time is the tasting tomorrow? Um... 11:00. - 11:00? - Mm. Did you tell them to bring my favorite strawberry coconut cake? Yes, yes, I did. Rosalyn... no. - No, what? - Ooh. - You see what I'm talkin' about? - Yes. - No. - Baby, come on! I'm just flirting. Just a little. Whatever. - Excuse me. - What can I get for you? Whatever the gentleman's having over there. Plus next Friday's drink as well. - Awesome. - Mm-hmm. So you just gonna buy a stranger a drink? Come on. Men do it all the time. And besides, he won't be a stranger for long. You know, he's hot. - Where are you going? - To smell his cologne. That is some freaky shit. - Hi. - Hi. So... Since when did women start buying men drinks? I didn't know there was a rule. I didn't know there was a rule either, but I was... I've never had a random woman buy me a drink before. Then, maybe it's time for you to change your surroundings. Are you always this bold? Yeah. Let me see. What is it? Alberto... Yes. - Are you kidding me right now? - Yep, yep. What's your name? Rosalyn Mack. Professor Rosalyn Mack. And to my colleagues... - Doctor Mack. - Okay, Doctor Mack. It all makes sense now. Are you calling me a mack? No, this drink and you walking over to me naming my cologne the way you just did called you a mack. Okay, it's not that serious, but, um... - You are? - Lance Outlaw. - Outlaw? - Mm-hmm. - I like it. - Hmm. Hey, baby, how you doin'? Can I get a little sugar? You lookin' real sweet right now. Ugh. All right, maybe next time. Ugh. I guess this is the part where you ask me for my phone number. Are you... does it look like I ask for someone's number? - Certainly I chase people. - I, I... - Well, I'm a lady, all right? - I see that, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I just... I mean, with the drink and everything it just seems like... you do this kind of often, so, that's all. No. Your cologne and your sweater called out to me. They called out to me. - Really? - Mm-hmm. From way over here? Yes. Okay, Doctor Mack. I'll play along. What did my cologne and my sweater say? Let me see. Get it over here. Like it talks to me. So let me see, um... It says, "I'm single, and I'm looking for a very special woman to fill that void." Wow. Okay. I'm almost afraid of how smooth you are. That was funny. Really? No. Hi, there. Looks like you've lost your friend here tonight. Uh... I'm married. - You're married? - Uh-huh. Well, maybe I can help you in some business things. Perhaps I could give you my card. Yeah? Uh... okay. - So, Doctor Mack. - Mm-hmm? Are you single? Yes, by choice. By choice? What do you mean? I'm helplessly in love with the alpha male. - The alpha male? - Yes, the alpha male. Confident enough to handle my approach, which you already have. Mentally able to handle what I don't want. Right? Will fight for me, and he'll win. Yeah. Easy attention. Of course, I have to win. His walk, there's strength in every step. Yeah. He's always in a position to call the shots. And, he gets the ladies. - Oh, okay. - Yeah. - He gets the ladies, yeah. - Cool, that's good. So what does all of that have to do with you being single? I love the alpha male so much... I'm dating, I'm having fun. I just... I have friends. It seems like you love men as much as men love women. No, no, not men. - The alpha male. - The alpha male. - The alpha male. - Right. So... I take it that since you approached me that you plan on adding me to your circle of friends, into your single life? Something like that, right? I just bought you a drink. - That's all. - You came over and sniffed me. - I sniffed you? - Yeah. You came over here, invaded my space, and you sniffed me! That was funny! Well, you're lucky that you smell good. - You're lucky I smell good. - My God! Really? Like, this is a public place. - I can sit where I want to sit, right? - Mm-hmm. Now, are you sure I can't get no sugar? I'm a young, unemployed entrepreneur, but I still got money. All right. Ugh! Well... you also said that the alpha male can handle what you don't want. What's that? Commitment. Commitment, I can't be tied down, I can't be asked all these questions. Like, if I'm with you, I'm with you, right? Like, all this other stuff. Like, if I'm entertaining Joe Blow, it's just he and I, just relishing the moment, wing it! - Just live! - Just wing it, okay. - Live. - Okay, look, listen. Normally, guys don't tell women about other women that they're seeing. I mean, we try to at least make them feel like they're the only one. That is until you guys get caught. - Right, you right-- - Until you get caught. Look, I'm not trying to get all in your business, or anything like that, but, do you, um... do you tell these alpha males about the other alpha males? I'm single. - I'm single. - I get that part, but, do these guys know about each other? I don't owe them anything. I'm a single lady. Um... yes, hi, that was my last card, actually. Could I... Yeah, thank you very much. Ugh! Okay, so, with all of these alpha males, do you, um... Bang, bang, me love you long time? Bang, bang, bang. No, I don't. I was just... I was playin'. I was just playin'. No, but, if I want to cuddle... there is someone on speed dial. If I want to go to dinner, there's someone pulling out my chair. Right. And, drinks and conversation... Me. Yeah, for now. For now. And... next Friday. I might be here. - You might be here. - I might be here. - Then I might see you. - You just might. - I might? - Yeah. - Okay. Cheers. - Yeah. Cheers. Thank you for the drink. Mm-hmm. - You're welcome. - Mm-hmm. - It is nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you too. - Mr. Outlaw. - Attorney... - Oh! - ...Outlaw. Attorney, oh, ow, ow! - Yeah, mm. - Yeah. Smells so good. Well, thank you. I'll see you next Friday. Chris. - Chris! Come on, get up. - Rosalyn, I need sleep. Ayesha and I have stuff to do this morning, all right? That's good. You should go do that. I'll let myself out. Uh, no, I don't think so. You gonna go through my bras, and try to sniff my panties and stuff. Technically I already have that luxury. I'm just sayin'. Come on, get your stuff. And make sure you take everything, all right? - Come on. - My bad. Yeah. I don't wanna get you in trouble with David. Or was it Stephen? Oh, maybe it's the new guy, Lance. You know you just broke rule number two, right? I just said their names. I didn't ask for any details. So, no, I didn't break rule number nothin'. Please don't say their names ever again. Why did you add someone new to the equation, anyway? I just tell you too much, you know that? I tell you too much, and I should have never told you about this stuff. You told me because you trust me, and none of them have your heart the way that I do, so... That's it? Okay. I told you because I've known you for a long time, and I thought I could be honest. Can I ask you a question? Yep, just don't ask me anything about them. All right. I'm nothin' like these other men that you date. You know, the big-time lawyers, the doctor that you dumped last year. The dude that owned that team in Canada somewhere. I don't even know where the hell it was. - These alpha men. - Mm-hmm? And then, there's me. Just regular, old, vanilla ice cream, no sprinkles. Chris. - Yep. - So why do you keep me around? Come on, now. Just, come on, get your stuff. Can you go? Hurry. What role is Lance playing? - You're kidding me. - Lance. - Stupid name. - Yep. Get your stuff and go. You know... what if I told you I was falling in love with you? Hmm? - I'd say you broke rule number one. - Man, fuck your... - Oh? - F your rules. Oh, I'm so glad you caught yourself. I love you, and I don't know what to do. So there. First thing you could do is just get those emotions in check. Well, my emotions have a mind of their own, so... I'm gonna say this one time. And then I'll be done, then I need you to go, seriously. I just don't have time. I don't have time to commit. I mean, I'm trying to open my school, you know? Teach, and everything else, I just don't have time for it. Let me have dinner waitin' for you when you get home. Don't do this, Christopher. - A candlelit bath, glass of wine. - You're only hurting yourself. - You're only hurting yourself. - Deep tissue massage, - essential oil. - Okay, you know what? You need to stay away for a while, 'cause I need you to pull yourself together. I mean, this is actually, this is crazy. Goodbye. Go. - Rosalyn. - Nope. Okay, goodbye. Rosalyn, talk to me. Oh, my God, are you kidding me? Fine. All right. Until next time, Cruella de Vil. Yep. Girl, I know she's going to love your stuff. I hope so. You know how brides are, though. I know, but you come highly recommended, you know? It'll be all right. Ayesha, you're gonna love her stuff! I'm ready. I have wine! Okay. All right. - Would you like a little? - Just a little. - Ah, you little lightweight. - Yes. - Ah! - Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. She's the turn down one. - Ah! - Oh, let me have some fun. Would you like some wine? You know I can't do that, I'm working. Girl, Jesus had a little wine while he was working. Right? I'll just pour you a little bit, okay? Just leave it there for you. - Just a little. - Okay. All right, so what kind of cakes do you have here for us to taste? - I have tons-- - The strawberry coconut? - Strawberry coconut cake? - Strawberry coconut. I didn't know nothin' about strawberry coconut cake. What? Rosalyn, you didn't tell her to bring a strawberry coconut cake? What are you talk-- I didn't tell you what cake she was gonna bring. - Yes, you did! - What? When you were undressing that man with your eyes at the bar. Well, there you have it! If I'm eyein' a guy at the bar, you invadin' my privacy, huh? I mean, for real! I mean, he was hot! - Y'all is silly. Ladies, listen. - I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I have some amazing things for you to taste today. Now, it may not compensate for your strawberry coconut cake, or whatever it is that you wanted, but, I do think you will love them. And you know what? My job is to make sure you're very happy with your wedding. I can't believe you. Somebody cares. Oh, that's terrible! Will you forgive me, please? - Yes. - I'm sorry. I'll give you this one. - Okay. - You can hand her that one. - There you are. - Okay. Mm, I think babe is gonna love this. It's actually the number one pick of most brides. This is good! I like it! Better than that damn coconut cake. You know what? I can't with you. No! But it's okay. It'll do. Ha-ha. She just don't wanna give in. Rosalyn, Judy does not want to hear all of that. Oh, yes, she do! Judy wanna hear it all. She said Judy wanna hear it. And that's enough. - Okay! - She gonna wish she hadn't. Okay, look, you're gonna have to keep up, 'cause this is gonna go real fast. - Hold onto your seat, all right? Look... - Okay. David doesn't know about Stephen, Stephen doesn't know about David. No one knows about Lance. And Christopher knows about all of them boys. Oh, my goodness. - It sound like a movie! - Mm-hmm. - Okay, okay, okay. - It damn sure is. Hold up. I have a serious question to ask you. Mm. You 'bout to kill my vibe. - No, I'm not. - Okay, okay, okay. What? Why is it that Christopher knows about all these men that you're seeing? Hmm? Why you all lookin' at me like that? Like, what? I mean, what? He's my... best friend. Yeah. You don't love him? Of course I love him! Yes, like, I mean, as a friend. Yeah, and that's it, Rosalyn? Look, it's simple. It's just... Christopher and I, you know, we have amazing sex. Yeah, amazing sex, yeah. Elaborate! Like... That kind of sex. - Like, oh! I'm gettin' it in sex. - Girl, wait, no. - Do you get the chills the next day? - Girl, it's like a igloo. You know what I mean? It's so, oh, my God, it's amazing. So it just blossomed into this wonderful friendship. It works for us. - Yeah. - Yeah. I mean, but come on, do you want a relationship with him? Girl, please, I don't want a relationship with anybody. Not with anyone? Stephen? - What about Stephen? Hmm? - Mm-hmm. Stephen. That, yeah, Stephen, um... he's a great guy. He reminds me of just living life, you know? - Life? - To the fullest. And he takes the moment, he seizes it, he travels the world. And he just, oh, my God, he spoils me. I mean, the gifts, it's like a freakin' meteor shower. It's beautiful, I love it. Okay, yeah, but you don't love him. - What? - But he sounds like a good man. Girl, why? Because he buy me gifts? Girl, anybody could buy me a gift. Like, really? Like, for real. Okay, so, speaking of that, David. Um, that's a different type of person. You know, he's, he's a great educator, you know? And a great father. I would love a man like that. There's just not that many good ones out there anymore. He's definitely one-of-a-kind, you know, but when we're out, he does this one thing that just freakin' irritates me all the time. Like, it's the craziest thing! Like he always talks about his daughter every single time. Like we can never have a real conversation. He just always interrupts me about his daughter! I don't know, that sounds kind of sweet to me. Oh, really? I'm gonna give him your number, how 'bout that? - Uh... - Oh, okay, yeah. I know, you're engaged. I'm just kidding. I'm just kidding. All right, so what about this Lance? Lance, okay, well, it's kind of new. I mean, Lance is new. Do not tell me you are sleeping with three men at the same time? Um... I'm gonna need you to put your wine down, because I don't think your hearing is working. I don't think your ears are working. Girl, I never said I was sleeping with all of those men. I never said that. But, they take you out, they buy you lavish gifts. - As they should. - They take you to fabulous places. - As they should. - And you ain't sleepin' with 'em? I didn't say none of them, I said not all of them. Yeah, not all of them. You know? But, listen... if you value yourself, you don't have to devalue yourself. You know what I mean? And, they want to make me happy. And so, they already know that if a man won't do it, another man will. And, guess what? I'm the damn mack in this place. - So I'm just sayin'. - Damn! Okay. I'm just sayin'... it's good. Speakin' of that, what about the sex? The sex, yeah. I'll have to pull it back on that and probably go into some of them sites or something, I'm not sure, 'cause, I mean, you know, Christopher's talkin' about this love stuff, and it's just freaking me out. Like, it's really freaking me out. - Rosalyn! - Are these men, you know, are they pressuring you for sex? You... I would say no, but you know what? Just the other day, and I meant to tell you this, like, Stephen was like, he can't move, or he's lickin' his lips, and he's doin' this. I didn't know if he was like a little rabbit or what. - Like, I was like, well, yeah! - What? I didn't know what was going on, but I was like, "Yo!" He was... Kind of fast. - Like it was steak. - I'm just kidding! I'm embellishing it a bit, I'm embellishing a bit. I have a delivery for Doctor Rosalyn Mack. I'm Doctor Mack. - Sign right here, please. - Okay. - Thank you. - Thank you. - Have a good one. - You too. What is this? Oh. This is so sweet. Oh. This is beautiful! Oh, my goodness. How sweet. - Hi. - How do you like the dress? It's beautiful. I love it. Wear it for me Saturday night. You're coming home? Yeah, my plane lands first thing Saturday morning. I'll see you Saturday. And I'm gonna send my chef over. I would like to have a beautiful meal in your home. I'm tired of us always going out when I see you. Thinkin' that it would be a nice change of pace. I love that. I would absolutely love that. Oh, God, do you know? I'll be havin' this dress on, and these pumps, waiting for your arrival. I'll talk to you soon, baby. Bye. Babe, how are your wings? Did you like them? - Are they good? - Oh, they were delicious. - Good! - They were fire! - I knew you would like this place. - Yeah. Wings are everything, right? You know, speaking of like, I forgot to tell you what Kayla did today. Oh, what did she do? She read an entire book to me. - The entire book? - Three years old. - Genius. Beast mode. - Oh, my... that's awesome! I mean, you're smart, that's where she gets it from. You know I'm borderline genius, baby. You are so funny. That's not right. Shoot. Babe, so your basketball players, and students, like, how are they? They cool. Hey, I want you to take a look at this. - Okay, okay, okay. - Take a look at that right there. Oh, my God, look at her! She's so cute! - Supermodel. - She's beautiful. Yeah, yeah. Can't wait to get her an agent. Okay, I can see that. A star. You know I can't wait for you to meet her. I would love to meet her. You would be a great second mom to her. Oh, wow, Mommy. She even got your eyes a little bit. Look at that. Yeah, I can see the resemblance. Then, hopefully, we can start makin' our own children together. Oh, okay. - Oh, baby, you're so sweet. - Don't do that, come on, now. You know better than that. What's wrong with you? - Come on. - What just happened. - Okay. - There we go. - There's my baby. - Okay. I'm gonna go to the restroom, babe. Okay, cool. I'm gonna call my mom, check on Kayla. - Okay. - Have her video chat me. Hey, Ma. Hey, put Kayla on the phone. I'm gonna video chat with her. I know you don't know how to-- She knows how to do it, she's a genius. Hey, baby! Sorry. Daddy loves you. You okay? I'll be home soon. You want a kiss? Okay, one kiss. Mwah! Double kiss. Mwah, mwah! Triple? You said triple? Okay, okay, here we go, here we go. Mwah, mwah, mwah! Quadruple? Girl... Mwah, mwah, mwah, mwah! Okay! I'm sorry. I know I'm late. Forgive me. That's all right. That's okay. That's okay, my friend kept me company. - Your friend? - Mm-hmm. Okay. So... what are you drinking, anyway? Um, this is one of their finest grown man drinks. - Grown man? - Mm-hmm. Someone forgot to check your ID. - Yeah, yeah. - That's funny. That's funny. I bet I could drink you under the table. - Absolutely not. - No? I think you might be a little intimidated. - By you? - Oh, yeah, absolutely. The way you talkin' you need a sip of this drink. - Go ahead. - Uh, no, thank you. - I'm a wine woman. - What can I get for you? Nothing, thank you. We're not drinking tonight? No. Late dinner. Date? Late dinner. Mm-hmm, late dinner, okay. All right, I'll play along. How are you doin' tonight? I'm great. - Yeah. I'm great. - Yeah? So, tell me, any exciting new cases? What? I wouldn't say exciting, but there is one that is... it's giving me a run for my money. You know? And to be real. I think my client did it. All of the evidence points to him, so... - I don't know. - What is he accused of doing? - Oh, come on now, Professor Mack. - Okay, okay. - I just, I tried. - I can't tell you that. - Okay. - But, I will say this... I just think it's a case of a guy falling in love with the wrong woman. Ah. - That can happen. - That can happen. - That can happen. - Yeah. Are you the wrong woman? I can be. - To the wrong man. - Oh, I heard that. - Uh-huh, to the wrong man. - Mm-hmm. But, I can be a fabulous friend. And a great confidant to the right man. - Mmm. Got it. Got it. - Yeah. Mm-hmm. So how about breakfast Saturday? - I would love to. - Okay. All right. Good, good. You got a special place in mind? Anywhere your money takes us. Oh, is that right? - Yeah, yeah... - Okay. ...I don't know your pockets look like! Know what I'm sayin'? Why do I get the feeling I'm getting into something that even my firm can't get me out of? I don't know. But I guess you'll give me a call whenever you and your firm figure that shit out. Okay? - All right, all right. - I'm out. Gotta go. I'm starvin'. Mm, starvin', starvin', starvin'. Hey. What are you doin'? Of course you are. Don't you feel like gettin' me a Johnny Donnie Pastrami on rye with a pop? Whatever, Okay. I'll see you when you get here. Bye. Delivery! Hi! Did some really short but extremely greedy lady order a fat-ass pastrami sandwich and a diet soda? So it kind of seems like she's eating healthy. - Is that what happened? - Oh, wow, you're funny. You know I'm fightin' it. - But, do you win? - You'll let me win. No, I might let you land a punch or two, I don't know about winning. Get in this kitchen, 'cause I might kick you back out. You know what? It is pastrami day at the soup kitchen, so I'm just gonna go ahead and get this-- Get back in here with my food and stop playin' with me. My brother shows me a picture of this girl who has a Coca-Cola body, okay? - I mean, she was stacked. - Okay. Smooth, brown skin. Curly hair, like a legitimate ten. All right? I pull up to her house. Dressed to the nines, all right? Like she is-- Murder, She Wrote, just killin' me, ten times. - I am dead. - She was real gorgeous. From a distance she was everything. From a distance? Like, what are you talkin' about? Okay, shorty got in the car. All right. She had a god damn Jheri curl. - She did not! - I'm talkin' about a real curl, girl. Like '80s curl. You could smell the newness of it too. Like, she had just took the rollers out, you could hear the juice. - Like... - Ew! And you know what? She probably brushed it up in a bun, had little baby hairs on the side. - Did you say baby hairs? - Yeah. Those ain't baby hairs no more. She was 35 years old, come on! Brush that shit up with everything else. You gotta let that go, girl! I mean, but, did you go out with her? I said she was stacked, right? Course I went out with her. You know how I like it. - You know how I like it. - Oh, yeah, I know you do. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - Oh. Oh, excuse me for a second, okay? - I need to take this. - Mm-hmm. Hello? I'm gonna have to go. I gotta get dressed. Really, Rosalyn? 'Cause it seemed like we were having a pretty nice time. I mean, we were, but Ayesha wants to try on some dresses. Like, her wedding dresses, or something like that, you know? Shit, how long have we known each other? A long time, why? But, my girl needs me. - I'm just gonna-- - No, no. That's not what I'm gettin' at. You don't have to lie to me. - What are you talkin' about? - That was David. Yeah. I saw his face before you answered the phone. Okay, um, I'm sorry. - I am, but I do have to go. - You don't have to lie to me, and never should you feel like you have to lie to me. Like, a man, a partner, a real life partner is supposed to bring out the best in you. Lying to a man to be with him? That's not your best. I'm sorry, but I gotta go, and I'll just, I'll call you later on tonight, okay? - I'll just call you tonight. - No. No? No. You're gonna sit down. And we're gonna finish this food. You're gonna work on these papers that you need to get these grants so you can open up your own school, Doctor Mack. Wow. When did you get all authoritative? I mean... - I gotta-- - Rosalyn, sit down. Please. I guess I can cancel. Okay. Hey, David. I'm gonna have to cancel, I can't make it. Yeah, okay. Bye. Thank you. So you're telling me that this woman had activator all over your new leather seats? All over the damn headrest. - Oh, that's bad. - Absolutely! And she tried to call herself sneak, wipin' it off on her way out. How did she do that? Okay, so she kept her hand on the headrest as she got out of the car, right? And then, she tried to drag her fist across the headrest, like her skin was supposed to soak up the Jheri curl juice. - That's hilarious. - The whole time I'm watching her do it. I'm like, "Really, please, go ahead. I dare you to wipe that off with your skin." - Oh, God. - Just nasty. I don't-- so, I mean, did you see her again? I was up first thing in the morning waiting for my car to get detailed. Hell, no, I didn't see her greasy self again. Are you kidding me? And she didn't call you? To do what? Pay for the car detail? She knew she greased up the car! - That's terrible. - Ol' Rick James-ass self. That's crazy. You're crazy, you know that, right? What? Nothin'. Why are you looking at me like that? Like what? Like a movie? Yeah. Like a sexy movie? Is it? It's sexy. Classic. Black and white film. Kept in a secured room in a library. With love and honesty being the only keys to unlock the door. You know that was corny as hell, right? But, it was good. It was cute, you're lucky you're cute. - I know, I am cute. - Oh, my God, you're crazy. You're lookin' nice, you're lookin' good. So how'd you sleep? Mm, like a baby. - Yeah? - How about you? I had a couple hours of sleep. You know, paperwork, cases, they usually keep me up at night. - I can imagine. - Yeah. So... Miss, Doctor, Professor Mack. Yes. - You have any children? - No. - No? - I want a son, though. Okay, all right. Marriage? Mm, mm. - Eventually. - Right. - Yeah, eventually. - Yeah. When do you think you'll be ready? Perhaps after I open my school. Get it up and running. Sounds like a good plan. You got a lucky guy in mind? No, no, no, no. No, no, I haven't met my husband yet. How do you know? Believe me, a woman knows the man that she's gonna spend the rest of her life with. - Mm-hmm. - Mm-hmm. I swear, all of you say the same thing. You know what? I hate to rain on your false information parade, but the woman does not choose a man. The man chooses the woman. I always choose my men. Oh, is that so? You talkin' about your toys? - Your boy toys? Yeah. - Toys? Toys? I bet they do everything you tell them to do, don't they? You must know them personally. Just for the record, you're not adding me to your little circle of friends, okay? - No? - No, sorry. Okay. Conversation is always good. You know, I mean, listen... don't take me wrong, but, women, you don't... How do I say this? You think with your heart. Not with your mind, okay? A lot of times, women, your hearts are all twisted up. Have you dealing with and falling in love with men that aren't any good for you. You know, stuff like that. I don't get that. So I guess that every woman that you've been with has been good for you. No, no. I'm not sayin' that. But, if I do find out that she's not right for me, I dismiss her. The same way a judge does with cases against my clients. You are slick. Most outlaws are. You know, these guys, these men that you deal with, - the ones that you chose? - Oh! I don't think that they see anything in you, or about you, in them. They just love the idea of having a beautiful, sexy, educated woman who chose them by their side. Nothing else? No. All right, so, these men. Mm-hmm? Mm-hmm? I don't sleep with them. Yet... they're there whenever I need them. - Oh, any time? - Push a button. - Any time? You've got to be-- - On call! - Are you serious? - Every time. - They just sittin' around waitin' on you? - Yeah, yeah. Dry. Let me tell you somethin'. Every man you ever met has at least ten women on speed dial just in case one of them calls themselves holding out. We're not sittin' around just twiddlin' our thumbs waitin' on you. - Well, my life works for me. - Oh, I'm sure it does, but listen. Now, you, and it's obvious, you are a beautiful woman. Right? Beautiful. Sexy, educated, I mean, fine. Why not just be that woman? I didn't know I was being anyone else. Like, I thought I was being that woman. You know what I see? I see that there's a reason that you feel the need to have a list of men in your life. I love strong, dominant men. - Yeah. - No, no, that's not it. - No? Okay. - That's not it. That's not it. So... What is it? Since you all of a sudden know me so well. - What is it? - Slow down. Tell me this. Did you have a father at home when you were younger? - No. - Brothers? - I'm an only child. - Ah, okay. - Uncles, male cousins? - Yes. - But, I didn't spend much time with them. - Why's that? My mom moved away when I was three years old. She divorced my father, we moved here to Chicago, okay? And, I don't have any family. Hmm. I see. I see, I see. You're asking me a million and one questions. And the only thing you have to say is, "I see." I'm thinking. You're thinking. This is actually really, really funny to me. - This is, this is funny. - It's funny? - Yeah, it's-- - These men that you're seeing? You see them as father figures. Oh. Is that your analysis of my love life? Your love life? There is no love in your life as far as I'm concerned. - Oh... - Your not having a father in the home when you were growing up is why you have so many men in your life right now. Oh. Aw, where you goin'? Home, counselor, I have things to do. - Oh, did I hit a nerve? - Oh, come on. I wouldn't allow anyone to do that. Oh, okay, so I didn't read you at all, right? - Inaccurately, yes. - Okay, listen... stop tryin' so hard to be a man, and pick your money up. Breakfast on me, okay? Enjoy. Okay, all right. You have a good one. Mm-hmm, you too. Yeah. Love playin' in your makeup. I know! And hopefully I'm doin' a great job. But he bought me this wonderful dress. - Stephen did. - He did? Yeah, he did. Hopefully I'll look fabulous in it. But... let me tell you what Lance said the other day, okay? He asked me a thousand questions and reminded me of somebody else. Yeah, I wonder who that is. - Oh, really? - Oh, yeah. - Me, huh? - Oh, he did. I'm serious. - What'd he ask you? - Girl, well, let me see. Before or after he told me that he wouldn't be joining my little circle of men. - He said that? - He said that. - Wow. - Yeah, but, and then... He calls himself, "Reading me." He basically is like, "Well, do you have any men in your life?" And, I'm like, clearly I do. Like, I mean, you know. He's like, "In the household?" And I'm like... I didn't know where he was going with it, right? So then, I'm like, "What?" He's like, "A father." I'm like, he went there. - Wow. - Wow. - He actually said that? - He actually said that. And so, I'm like, "I really didn't know my father." You know, "I'm an only child." And so, he's like, "That's it. That's it. You're looking for a father figure in these men." I'm like, "Are you freakin' kidding me?" Can you believe he said that to me? - Oh, Lord! - Yeah! Rosalyn, what did you say to him? Girl, I left him sippin' his damn tea! And I looked back, and his-- probably little finger was up. You know what I'm sayin'? Like, for real, then... I went in my purse. Left him sitting there with my purse and dropped $20 on the table. Turned around, and he goes, "Pick up your money." You know, "You're tryin' to be hard. Tryin' to be like a man. Pick up your money." - So, you know. - Rosalyn. - What? - I think you finally met your match. Girl, please! He doesn't mean anything to me. Girl, I got a hot date. I need to get out of here, 'cause... he clearly means nothing. I'm gonna go see my man. Hopefully I look great. Your makeup looks beautiful. - It's, um... Okay! - Go get him! Oh, hi! Hi, oh, okay. Oh, babe. Good evening, Doctor Mack. I am Badi. I am Mr. Thompson's new servant. Okay. I present to you Mr. Stephen Thompson. - No, Badi, you're not a servant, you're... - Don't argue! - Okay. - ...an assistant. Okay, I... okay. I, uh, I just acquired, as a majority owner, a new African American concierge app, and she's one of the people. - That's wonderful. - You look amazing. - Stunning, baby. - You like? This is the dress. - Yes. - Oh, I love the roses. - I love the roses. - Badi. Badi. - Badi! - I love them! - Yes, yes! - Okay, Badi, Badi, no, Badi. Badi, pick up the roses, please. Okay, okay. Badi. No. Oh, I know that move. Oh! Pop it! Okay! - Oh! - Badi, no, no, no, okay. - Oh, okay. - Please, pick up the... - Thank... - Oh, my God! That was like-- That was amazing. - Baby. - She's a little over zealous. - But, um... - No! That was fun. Mr. Thompson, would you mind if I be excused while the two of you enjoy this wonderful meal I prepared? Why, certainly, Bayo. Madame. You've been wonderful. You have. Oh, so gracious. Thank you. Thank you. Enjoy. That feels so good. You're gonna make me do somethin' to you that I don't wanna do. You can do anything to me you wanna do. Really? Look at you in this black dress. You're gonna make me get you a collection of little, tiny black dresses. - Yeah? - Yeah. And heels? For every dress. It's not too late. We'll just go tomorrow. I missed you so much. You too. Two months, it felt like it was killing me. I would be in boardrooms, and just fallin' asleep. Couldn't concentrate. It was just... But I know you pulled it together. I mean, that's what you do, right? These meetings are worth millions of dollars. You know I know how to close a deal. I made millions, yeah. I'm so proud of you. It's nothing, it just adds to my worth, that's all. You're so modest. You're so modest, I love it. I call it humility. - Humility? - But, that's for my baby. - No. - That's for my queen. - Your queen? - My queen. How long are you here? About two weeks. I'm meeting with an investor in the Philippines, and then I move on to Dubai, then I'm back to Costa Rica. - Costa Rica. - Yeah. Meeting with a couple of marketing companies out there. Then a couple of private airlines. That's amazing! You're doing your thing. I love it. I'm so proud of you, babe. I was hoping while I was here that me and you could, um... I don't know, maybe go on a little mini vacation. - Little mini vacation? - Palm Springs. Vegas, Cabo, maybe. Baby, you are so busy. You're so busy, like, we don't have to fly. We can stay here in Chicago. Chicago! We can do some stuff in Chicago. We can. We can go to lunch. There is some... diners here. We can have fun in Chicago. Hmm? Rosalyn, what's going on between us? Huh? What are we doing? Talking. No, no, no, no, what are we doing? What are we doing between me and you? I mean, we've been doing this for a year. I don't know what you mean, babe. I travel, maybe two, three weeks at a time and... when I come back I want to see my woman. I'm here. I'm here, babe. Are you here? - Yes, babe. - Yeah? - I'm here. - Show me. Show me. I tell you, I show you, right? - Whoa. Show, oh, that. - Show me. - Oh, show... - Oh, yeah. Oh, that. - Yeah, I've been patient. - Okay, okay. Have you? Really? You've been patient? I eat, sleep, think Rosalyn, yeah. I was told that no man just twiddles his thumbs, like... you don't twiddle your thumbs, do you? What does that have to do with me? Babe, come on. I mean, 'cause if you're not getting it from me, you're getting it from someone. Hey, who told you that? Whoever told you that, they... it's bad advice. You should fire them. 'Cause not every man works like that. I mean, look at me. Really look at me. I shower you with gifts. I do. When I'm not in a meeting, I'm on the phone with you. You have the keys to... - everything. - I know, babe. Including my soul. And you know, if you wanted to go on any business trip with me, you could go. My entire life is open to you. I'm just... I'm not ready, babe. - I'm not ready. - So when? When will you be ready? I don't know. I'll let you know, babe. - I just need more time. - Another year? Yeah, another year, like, I... I just need more time, babe. More time, please? No, baby. No? I'm sorry, I just can't wait forever. I need you to wait. I need you to wait. Like, I just need, I want it to be special. I want it to be so special. - I don't want special. - It'll be special. It'll be special. It'll be special. I don't want special. I want you. Will you give me you? I just need more time. I trust you. I'll wait. I'll wait. I won't ask you to make love to me, I know that... you'll come to me when you're ready. It's your move to make. Thank you. This hot chocolate is good. I know, it's really good. The only thing missing from this is my baby Kayla. She loves her some hot chocolate. I'm sure she does. - Man, man, man. - You know... that's actually why I wanted to talk to you. We can't do this anymore. You don't wanna meet my daughter? No, that's not what I'm sayin'. Your daughter's adorable. I mean, she's adorable. I just don't want to waste your time anymore, you know? It's like, you always talk about your daughter. You know, we don't even have a normal conversation without you interrupting me about your daughter. I love the fact that you're, like, heavy in her life. I think that's great. But you have to have a balance. It's just not normal. You know, I think you might need some therapy. - Therapy? - Yes. What, because you have a PhD, Doctor Mack? You think you can analyze me? That's not what I'm sayin', David. I just-- you need a balance. I mean, it's just not normal. I think there might be some... medication for this. Medication. You know, Doctor Mack, I truly hope you find real love. But you could have texted me this shit. It's the coldest day in Chicago and you got me here tellin' me this. Oh, oh, you just pat me like a puppy... Oof! Good luck. Take care! Hey. Are you busy? Oh. Professor Mack. Come on in. - Thanks for seeing me. - That's no problem. How are you? I am... workin'. I know, I see you. So... what can I do for a player? I am not a player. - No? - No. I don't know, Professor Mack. You seem like the real MVP to me. Can you relax on that, please? Oh, excuse me. What's wrong, one of your alpha males giving you a hard time? No, I'm just... I'm tired. - Oh, yeah? - Yeah. Tired from what? I've been seeing these three guys. Uh-huh. One knows everything about me. The other two are... - clueless. - Hmm. So this one guy. - Christopher. - Christopher, okay. - What does he know? - Christopher and I dated years ago. Mm-hmm. And, when we broke up... we remained friends with benefits. He's the only one I've been sleeping with. - Okay. - Okay, well, he knows about the other two. He wanted to know why I added you to the mix. - Added me? - Yeah. What are you talking about? I mean, I hope you corrected him on that. - I will! - You will? - Yes. - You need to hurry up. Anyway. I was with Stephen last night. And he is... he's a wonderful guy. He is, he's, he's a great guy. Mm-hmm. Hmm. - Are you in love with Stephen? - No, no, no. I'm, I'm... I'm in love with Christopher. Rosalyn, why are you really here? Seeing the love in... Stephen's eyes, you know? And just... knowing I'm gonna ultimately just hurt him. That's... That's the only reason? That's it, that's the only reason? Nothing about fixing Rosalyn, is that all? It's... it's all about fixing Rosalyn. It is, I mean... Let me just say this first, okay? I... they weren't supposed to fall in love with me. All right? I mean, Stephen had all of these girls. All these girls, and I was okay with that, because I wasn't looking for a relationship. Okay, so, at one point... they were living the same lifestyle that you're living now. And then things changed with them, they wanted to get into something more serious with you. But you're still the same Rosalyn that they met. Am I right? Yes, but, I mean... kind of. Stephen fell in love, and that changed everything. I couldn't tell him about who I was with, who I was seeing. And, he was like, "Oh, it's either them or me." You know? And, he's splurging on me. He's spoiling me, and he wanted me to choose. And so, I just made him think he was the only one. Okay. All right, I got it. You know, I'm just, I'm done. I'm done, I'm done... Stephen just professin' his love, and Christopher is... Shows me every day. Every day. You're lookin' to settle down. Right? I guess so, yeah. I am. With Christopher. Why do you say Christopher? Why do you think I said Christopher? Look, we both know you're not tryin' to be somebody's stepmother. - No, not right now. - All right, so we can take that idea and throw that out. - Right? - Okay. You say you're not in love with Stephen. And you said that you and Christopher are friends, you're lovers, and you love him. I do. So... I don't know, Professor Mack. Seems to me you've already made your choice. Rosalyn, this is nice. I don't know what the occasion is, but this right here? - Nice! - It's no occasion. Just wanted to cook for you. Well, then why are you so dressed up? You could have told me it was gonna be formal. I'd have put on a blazer or somethin'. You know your boy's got some clothes, I mean... - You're fine, okay? - Mm-hmm. The way you eatin' that food, though, it's like you haven't eaten in a couple days. - It's good! - Okay. You know I love your cookin'. You need to cook more often. You can't find your ass in that big-ass kitchen you got. Christopher? - What's up? - I'm ready. You're ready for what? A relationship. Us. Are you serious right now? Yeah. I am. Get the fu-- Shit. It's about god damn time! You got me jumpin' through hoops to be with you, woman! I know you love me. - Yes, I love you! - I know. I love your big head, I love your big feet, I love all of you, woman. Big head, big feet? You know I don't have big feet. So you agree that you have a big head. Oh, you go ahead and keep it up. Listen, all I'm sayin' is that I go to sleep, my head's on one pillow, I wake up, your head's on all the pillows. That's, that's not normal. It's like a two pillow head. It's at least above average. You gotta give me that. - I'm just sayin'. - You're lucky I like you. - Love. Lo, lo, lo, love. - Like. Like. - Okay, whatever. - Oh, my God! Oh! Life is good, finally! - It is. - I start my new job on Monday. I can finally start building, - saving for a home. - A new job? What are you doing? Oh, um, you are looking at a dental assistant. What? Like, you have to have a degree for that. Oh, wait, hold on. I think... What's in my pocket? It's a... - Bla-dao. - What is this? Wow! Congratulations! Oh, my... What? You're graduating in June with a BS in dentistry? Once I graduate, I'll start looking for a better job, while I'm pursuing that Masters. I'm speechless. Wow. Thank you, thank you. - Why didn't you tell me? - I wanted it to be a surprise! I did all of this for you and me, baby. For me? Yeah. Look, acting is nice. I love it, okay? But, when there's no work, there's no work. Baby, there are so many things that I want to do for you. But when I don't know where my next dime is coming from, I can't go splurgin'. I know that. Look, I get it! You know? If I had the money that Stephen or one of them had, we'd have been together for mad long. That's okay, no big deal. We together now, they gone, it's just us. I win. - Wow. - Bam! So that's what you think about me? Like... You think it takes money to win me? Uh, news flash, you like nice shit. Hello? I can dig it. You work hard. You deserve nice things. Ain't nothin' wrong with that. I couldn't spoil you, so you needed your Davids, and your Stephens and your Lance, whatever, doesn't matter. Like I said, they out the picture, it's just me and you now. Plus, I'm about to have that bread, so we gonna be good. Uh-uh-uh. I win. I love you. I love you. I know. And it is fuckin' awesome. But we can't be together. We can't be together. I mean-- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. We can't, like, you know every detail of... every date, every, I mean, everything I've done with the other guys. You would question every move I make. Whoa, whoa, whoa. No, no, no. - You wouldn't trust me. - Hold on. You can't just say that. You can't just read me, and put words in my mouth. You don't know that's gonna happen. If I leave the house, you'll wonder where I'm going. - Who I'm gonna go see. - Whoa, whoa, eh... You'll question my every move. - Yes, you will, babe. - No, no. You got me all wrong. I know and love you. There's a big difference there. You don't see that? I trust the hell outta you, Rosalyn. The fact that you would even tell me about all these other guys, that means everything. You don't get that? We can't be together. We can't be together. I mean, I... I wanna leave the old Rosalyn behind. Yeah, you can do that. You can do that, and we can move forward together. That is an option. What are you talking about? No, it's not. It's not. I... I want to start a new relationship, like new, without my past, without-- leave it all behind. Like, I can date the other guys, and they wouldn't even know the old Rosalyn. Okay, what the fuck is happening right now? I don't get it. Are there cameras somewhere? What's-- I don't get this. What... Okay, why, why are you dressed up? You know, why, why did you cook dinner? Why am I here? 'Cause there's no easy way to tell you that I'm just not gonna see you again. I can't see you. Are you fucking kidding me? Wow. Wow. You... You're not kidding. Oh, my, okay. Oh, my fuckin' God. Okay, you know what? Wow, all right, look. Thank you for this delicious food. This was fuckin' top notch, okay? And I wish you the absolute best in your life. I really, I really hope things work out for you. But, you know what? When they don't work out... with whatever rich dick it is that you decide to be with, please, just do me one favor, one small, one small favor, like a really fuckin' small favor, don't fucking call me. You wanna know why? Because my heart can't deal with anymore of your fucking bullshit! That's what you got a doctorate in. A PhD of bullshit. Go fuck yourself. I hope you die alone. - Interesting. - What? So you broke it off with David? Yep. Yeah, finally. Oh, how did he take it? I think he was fine. 'Cause, like, when he walked away, he just pat me on my head like a puppy. I mean, he did, it was the craziest thing. Hmm. So, what about... Stephen? I'll be seeing Stephen later. - Yeah. - Christopher? What is it? I hurt him. I hurt him so bad. How did you hurt him? I told him I didn't want to see him anymore. You know, um... That I just wanted to... move forward and not be reminded of my past. He would always judge me, you know? So you completely let him go. What's wrong? He would never see me again, you know? Never, I mean, he would never forgive me for that stuff. And it's just... I had to let him go. You're embarrassed, huh? I mean, I would be too, just a little. Because no woman, no real woman of class, dates all those men like that. I mean, I was gonna say somethin' to you as your friend, but... I was scared. I didn't know if I should say somethin', or just let you find out on your own. Sometimes lessons are the best experiences. I lost him. If you love Christopher, why don't you just be with Christopher? I can't see him again. He didn't... It's over, I can't see him again. It's over. I let him go. What am I gonna do? Just go out there and go get him. If you love him the way you say you love him, go find him. Tell him you love him. I can't. I can't. Ros. Why are you crying? If you like that decision you made, and you were confident in it. It's over. He's gone. He's gone, okay? He's gone. I made a mistake, all right? I made a mistake. And he's gone. I can't change that. I can't change that. - He won't forgive me, it's too-- - Ros. It's too late, do you understand? It's too late. - No, there's always second chances. - It's too late! It is. He doesn't want to see me. I'll never see him again. I'll never see him again. So what now? I don't know. I don't know. I'll never see him again. I hate to see you like this. Thank you. Oh. - You're beautiful. - Always for you. How was, um... Bayo and Badi, I think? Was that the name? Um... they are way too much. - I like them. - You know they are way too much. I like them. They're funny. I actually acquired their company. - The parent company. - Nice! Oh, wow. But this seemed urgent, so I didn't want to really... - Is it urgent? - No, not urgent. Like, have a seat, baby. Is everything all right? Do you need help with that? Everything's... actually great. Yeah. Um... - Um... - It's good to hear that. When do we leave? How quick can you pack your bags? Wait. - You're serious? - I am, babe. I'm ready. I'm ready. I wanna take a chance. Yeah. You just... - you completed my life just now. - Oh, babe. - Oh, baby. - Oh. Baby! - Oh, babe. - Oh. Oh, babe. - Oh! - Oh, babe. Oh, babe. Oh, my God. - Babe. - Oh, my. Oh, I can't wait for you to meet my family! - Oh! - No, we are gonna tra... I'm gonna have my queen next to me everywhere I go! Every time that I sign the dotted line, baby. We're gonna have three or four kids. Oh, four, four kids! Oh, baby, I'm not building just to be building! We building this for my children's children! - Oh! - Oh, my! Quit your job. - Baby, quit my-- - No, just quit your job. - Quit it! - Quit my job? - Yes, baby. - Wait a minute. Baby, you will never work another day in your life. Babe, but what about opening my school? Oh, fuck that shit! Wait a minute, I wanna do that shit! What are you talkin' about, "fuck that shit"? - I wanna do it... - Baby, listen, it's okay. Look, look, baby. You will be a home provider. You will take care of the children. You'll do a little dishes, maybe a little dishes, a little cleanin'. That's... housewife. It's a housewife? Baby, you, oh, it's gonna be beautiful. Okay, okay, okay. Um, somethin' to get right. Right, yeah. Oh, big, white house. Yeah, if you want that shit. Oh, that is so sweet! Oh, my God! White picket fence. - White picket fence, all right. - Yeah, white picket fence! - That's some white people shit, but cool. - Yeah! And a big tree with a tire hangin' on it. Yeah, get that shit too. Treehouse? - If you-- yeah! - Treehouse? I mean, I ain't building no treehouse, but I know some contractors. I actually saw a beautiful treehouse in Cape Town. - Gorgeous. Wood, maple. - Oh, it was beautiful? - Gorgeous! - What? Oh, babe. There's nothing like a father helping his kids build a treehouse. Well, um, I wouldn't be helping my children build a treehouse because I'm on business. That's where you fit in. - Right? - Ooh. Baby, home provider, - we're talking about building a legacy. - Oh, a housewife. Kingdom building. - Last name. - Stephen, Stephen, Stephen. - Can't wait for you to be my queen. - Stephen, Stephen, stop! Gorgeous. Oh, whoa! You're... this is too much. This, this fairytale. Like, you have this all planned out. Without even asking me what I want. It was good, though, right? It's good. No, to who? To who? You're askin' me to like... stop working. Quit my job, not open my school. - Like, every-- - Okay, okay, okay. All right, all right, look. We'll get to that later. All right? It's okay, for right now. No, no, we won't, like, you've thought this out so carefully planned. And, you deserve that life. I deserve the life that I want. I deserve the life that I want too. Okay. Rosalyn. I'm a businessman, I'm willing to negotiate. Now it's a contract? Huh? Like, no, this, this... this was a bad idea. It was. I should have followed my heart. Like, I... Should have followed my heart. I love you. - I love you. - I love you. - I do, I do. Um-- - I love you. I'm just not in love with you. I thought that when we got together and became one, it would change. Ow... Okay. Okay. - Whoo, oh, shit. - Oh, oh. Okay. Okay, um, I thought when we became one it would change. And you're a wonderful guy. You're so, you're a wonderful guy. - Okay. - Hoo. Do you need some water? Um... um... Okay, okay, um... So, so, hey, um... but this settling down, four kids, quit my job? - That wasn't my, oh, oh... wait. - Wait a minute. - Wait a minute. - Okay. - Wait a minute. Wait, wait, wait. - Babe. - Wait, wait, wait. - Babe. What do you, what do you mean that, that... you're not in love with me? I'm sorry. Like, I mean, I'm just trying to be honest. I'm not tryin' to hurt you. So now you're tryin' to be honest. Don't be mad at me. Let's think about this, right? You're gone all the time. Like, you're here a month every now and then. And then, you pop in just a couple days, and then you're gone again. Like, you're not here with me. You said that you understood me. I... You're right. You're absolutely right. And if you could have told me that before, Rosalyn, I probably would have made some steps to get myself in order. Oh, okay. I'm so sorry. Mind if I have some wine? - Um, sure. - Oh, thank you. Please. No. You should invest in some aged grapes. - Oh, okay. - I bid you adieu. Oh. Let me get my fucking scarf. - Stephen, take care. - Goodbye. Okay, okay. Um... Bitch. - Hi. - Hey. So what do you want? To give you this. Thanks. - Chris, wait. - For what? So you can twist my damn heart in knots again? No, no, um... I love you. - And I want us. - Look, I ain't got time for this. I've always loved you, okay? I've always loved you. I just didn't want you to judge me. I'm not playing these games. Look, okay. I want to be with you, all right? I just don't want to be reminded of yesterday. Like, I don't want you to remind me of the old Rosalyn. I already told you I wouldn't. I told you that I would never judge you. That the only thing that I ever wanted, was my Rosalyn. Wanted? Look, was, want, wanted. It's all the same. But these games? Look, I'm out there trying to better myself. I got a lot on my plate right now. I don't have time for this back and forth between me and you. I was running, okay? I was running, and I just don't want to be reminded of the old Rosalyn - and who I was-- - Hey. You already said that. At this point, you're just repeating yourself. I wanna live in the now, not yesterday, you know? Would you forgive me, please? I see you. We are gonna make a great power couple. Babe. The world ain't ready for us, Doctor Mack. - They're not? - Mm-mm. - I get my own, personal dentist? - That's right. We'll keep that mouth all kinds of pretty. I love you, Rosalyn. I love you.
