This is Malibu, California. Home of the rich and famous. My friend bought this house two weeks ago. He said, he likes the ocean view... But I know he just wanted to be on top of the mountain. If you think this is gonna be one of those stories about love and money. Well, you're right. Hi. - They made up other cases, you know. - Yes, I know. Why did you wait? 'Cause your court date came up. The judge hears the foster parents case for permanent custody. Okay, where do I sign? I wouldn't be so flip, if I were you. Don't you care about your daughter? They don't want to give me my daughter back. I wonder why I have to go through all this bullshit! Yeah? I don't give a fuck. - Name? - Vargas, three people. I don't see any Vargas here. I'm Anna Savagery Petrol Bederman Mc Ivers Vargas! Open the damn gate immediately! - I'm his mother! - Excuse me, Anna Sergeyeva... Welcome! Open the gate! I remembered Anna, of course. ! Was one of her ex-husbands. She was a beauttiful young Russian ballet dancer. She left me, long ago. Oh, stop it! As you can see she's held on to her looks! Take your hands off me! Don't touch those suitcases! Just, what do you think you're doing? - Alex, go find your brother! - I don't know, where he is. Mrs Anna Sergeyeva. Welcome to Malibu. Deema, I demand you stop these men! I'm sorry but they have their orders. It's our normal procedure. Who is giving these orders around here? - Me. - I demand to see my son! He sleeps. That's Deema, Oleg's right-hand man. They call him JID for Job Is Done. And he was certainly doing his job that day. We all had to grin and bear it. After all, Oleg was supporting most of us. Including Jane and me. Oh, I'm he sick looking one in the wheelchair. Darling! You look wonderful! Anna, I love you, but you're such a liar. - Well, Alex, how was Peru? - It was alright, I guess. Alright? It was fascinating! So exotic, it set my head to spin! That was the altitude, mama! Michael, Jane, I'd like you to meet Miguel Vargas. - Bueno, mucho gusto. - Pleasure. Encantado. I met him in Lima. His English is practically non-existent, but love is a universal language! Te quiero, te amo! Well, wow, twelve million dollars. I think my son is crazy! Of course, he is crazy. That's why we love him! - The view is lovely, don't you think? - Yes... Auntie Annal. Oh, hello! Anna didn't like to talk about her past. Maybe that's why I didn't know, she'd left a son behind in Russia. I met Oleg years later at the Blackjack table in Las Vegas. We were both serious gamblers, 50 we got along. OK. Yeah, but lately my strengths has deserted me. When Oleg asked me to the party, I wanted to say no... But I'd heard he was in trouble, 50 I showed up. And I wanted to wish him a happy new year. It's alright now... - Tails. - Heads! This is my lucky night! - James, happy new year! - A happy new year! - I have to talk to you. - About what? 1 got a call from Moscow... There's a problem. Relax. There's always problems in Moscow. I'll take care of it. Welcome! The piano is incredible! Can't believe, you bought that for me? You look beautiful tonight, oh my god, where did you get that dress? Don't be so coy, darling, when you know you've bought it for me. I'll buy you hundred more if you want. Aren't you in a wonderful mood, Oleg? Alex, you look great also! How do you like my new house? It's quite lovely. It needs remodelling. I know that... Well.. I'd better make my announcement before I change my mind. I've decided to retire. Alex is taking over the business. What are you talking about? Alex has a career in music. Mama, Oleg and I discussed it, I want to do this. Never! Never will you be involved in his dirty business! Anna, please calm down. Every business that Oleg has an interest.. In is completely legal and operates within the international code. Fuck the code! I know who he does business with! Gun runners and dope peddlers! But mama, I never made money from drugs. You're aliar! Mama, why are you acting like this? - Oleg, I'll talk to her later. - Alex, this just does not concern you. You have no right to do this! Mama, I want to have alife! Can't we discuss this like normal people? I really don't want to upset you tonight. We're together... - Do you like the house, don't you? - I hate this house! I hate it! I hate everything it stands for! - I'll never live here and neither Alex! - Oh, come on. We're leaving tomorrow. Now you listen to me! I bought this fucking house for you! If you ever want to see another penny from me, then you're going.. .To fucking live here and we're gonna be a fucking family! And that's an order! Happy new year! Happy new year! Let's go, come on. Happy new year! Over my dead body! You have any presents for us? Sure, sure. - Michael! - Yeah. - Oleg, what a wonderful party! - Thank you. What have you got here? The Cote d'Azur West? Well, we've got only one life to live! I don't know. - Sorry! - It's alright! Happy new year. Hi. - Hi. So looks fantastic?! - Yes, very good job. - So, good, you're happy? - Yes. - What? Huh? - Just a second. - Give this to your crew. - Oh, thank you. Happy new year! Who is this? - Don't fuck with us! - Fuck you, you fucking asshole! Mama, I'm sorry. I acted so badly. Oh, darling, I've completely forgotten about it. Ah, this is Miguel. - Miguel: this is my son Oleg. - Encantado, mucho gusto. You might as well know right now... We're married. Oh, congratulations. It is an honour to be amember of this family. - We are honoured to have you. - Thank you, darling. I'm so excited about the new year. So many good things! - Can I talk to you for a minute? - Sure. What is it? Alone. Sorry, mom. - Haven't you changed your mind? - No. What do you want to talk about? This is kind of embarrassing, but... - Mom needs money. - What's the matter? Nothing... It's Miguel... What did she marry that fucking Miguel for? Well, you know, mom's hot! - What's he do? - He's some kind of freedom fighter. Freedom fighter? He's a gigolo! You know how much she spent in the last year? Four million dollars! And I gave it willingly. But I will not pay for Miguel! You pay for him, if you want! Hil - You kissed me! - You look great, Oleg. - Thank you. - Can I have a word with you? - Sure. My wife wants to bring her two brothers over. - I already brought over them! - I know...

I don't remember. Don't torture him, Michael! You were the third! Remember, Miguel is number five! Yeah... [ hope, we can find time to get a little game going. Of course. How's the book coming? Oh, I'm struggling with the ending. Make one up. A happy one. - People want happy endings. - That's good advice. I'm leaving you alone, guys. You know... She cheated on me for years and she stopped when I got sick. She's been perfectly faithful. And we're finally happy together. This is the best time of my life. Ca you do me a favour? Go, ask her to dance. So, I can watch her dance. I hear you stopped screwing around? Did he tell you that? Of course. We are family. Well, it's true but don't tell anyone. I don't want to ruin my reputation. Okay? What does the doctor say? The doctor say six months. You have enough money? We can't take anymore of your money. Well, he doesn't have to know. Tell him it's for the book. Great party! - Alex okay. - Yeah. Oleg, what are you going to do now? - Daddy, I got youl! - Go on or I'll smack the both of ya! I'll bet you can't get your uncle Oleg!

But it's the first time this year, Michael. I mean... you know? You're still a goddamn slut! Alright, mister dying man, let's see what you got. Bye-Bye! Now you own the house. Well, I still have the stables and the beach. No, you can't have everything. True? Okay, true. I kinda wish you had. It's rather be you, keep it in the family. Truth? Of course. I'm worried, Michael. I think somebody's after me. I can't believe your getting paranoid after all this time. Things have changed, Michael. 1just lost the beach. You know I always wanted to have my own beach. Now you have it. Congratulations! Thank you. Let's go for some bathing beauties on the beach? No. That's it. It looks like my luck is running out. Oh, my kid! He's so cute! Oleg was such a good little boy. I forgot how talented you were... Just like me! You're drunk, mama. Go to bed. You can order your grooms here, not me! Mama, you promised! I refuse to spend another night here in this house... You look awful. You have alousy life. What happened to you, Oleg? What the fuck do you think happened?! You left papa and me, you didn't call us, nothing! You forgot about us! I had to watch papa drink himself to death. I was only aboy. You hear me?! A boy! I was only a child, I was fourteen! - You didn't want me! Never! - No! Iloved you. Iloved you. What do you know about love, anyway? You've never loved anybody in your whole life! You're right. Nobody taught me how to love! 'Cause nobody loved me! You left me and went off to fuck some guy! Don't talk to mama that! You don't understand what's going on. - So stay out of it! - Don't, don't...! Ever...! Mama, please! I need you. Mama, please... stay with me! I want a family. Mama, please... don't leave me... - Mama, please! - I can't... I can't... Mama, why don't you stay?! Because you'd rather fuck that gigolo? Why did you have to marry him for? Because I wanna fuck him! - Don't call her a whore! - Leave him alone! Vamos! Fuck all of you! Get out of here! Get up. I don't need any help. I'm sick of all this family shit! Oh, shit! - Uncle Anatoly, get up please! - Don't worry. - I have come to ask you a favour. - Yeah, it's about your wife's brothers. - Yeah. - I remember. So, tomorrow I'll let you know my decision, okay? I know you'll do right thing for your family, Alex. - Okay. - Thank you. - You wanna sit and watch the show? - No, thank you. My wife will kill me! That guy is always kissing me. Allthe time. I hate it! Oh, you're fired. Hey, don't play with guns. It's not a toy. Fuck you! I didn't know you're the boss. Yeah, I'm the boss. Yeah, who is this? - Where is the letter? - It's empty. - I don't get it. - I know you don't. - But we understand. - You understand what? If you get an empty letter in Russia it means someone wants to kill you. - Who? - We don't know. - We have to find out. - We can handle this. No, Alex; you're out. No, I'm with you on this. - I can help you. - You can't. My people will help me. They know what to do. You trust this smiling bastard more than me? Watch your mouth, Alex! - I don't want you involved. - I can do this! My decision is final. You're out. - Can you explain what's going on? - Just a second, James. - Sasha, it's me. - Ican't talk. - You owe me a favour, Sasha. - I don't know nothing. - Just tell me, is it Jamal? - Oleg, don't call me anymore. I can't work like this! Look... I sent my people to negotiate this deal. But I want to make some other arrangements... Tell me what's going on, Oleg. Listen, my friend... It will be all over by tomorrow. Don't worry. Yeah, it's me... Okay. What happened, honey? What do you think? I don't know. I went to a Catholic School so that kind of thing doesn't bother to me. - Do you believe in her? - No. I don't believe in anything. That's terrible! How can you live your life not believing anything? Easy! Then what's the problem? I don't know. There's two thousand there... - It's enough? - Sure, I mean... - We didn't do anything. - Iwanna play a game with you. Okay, what kind of game? I don't do kinky. This isn't at all kinky. You just have to watch. It's called... Russian Roulette. Relax! - You want more money? - Yeah. - Okay? - Yeah. Here's the game. You have to bet that money I gave you on... Whether I live or I die. - What do you mean? - I mean... You have to bet when I pull this trigger, I'm going to live... Or I'm going to die. I can't do that... - I don't think I like this game. - It's very Russian. Come on, raise your bet. What's it going to be? Four thousand, says you die, you crazy fuck! Sorry! This just wasn't your lucky night! You cheap asshole! You knew! No, I didn't know. Yeah, [ know... I'm just a helpless fucking... Slut! Soaml! Have you ever been faithful to someone you're really in love with? Never. See him? Crazy about him. - How could you be faithful? - He's beautiful. Oh, God, they all are! Can we try again? I thought maybe you'd like to play that game again. I didn't get a fair chance. Take the money and get lost. Thanks. Deemal. Deemal. I'm here, boss. What the fuck's going on, huh? What do I pay these people for? Cockroach killers. Job is done. Great. Arms up! Okay. Hi. Pacific Exterminator. It looks like you had quite a party, last night. Well, you know I can't start spraying until someone cleans this mess up. - Nobody is here who can do it. - What about you? I don't do dishes. Oh, we'll have a bit of a problem then. How about an extra hundred to clean up? Yeah, sure. I can use the money. - You need money? - Yeah, most people do. - Don't you? - No. I'm more the philanthropic type. I bet you'd rather be out by the pool, too, huh? No. Not much for lounging around. How do you relax then? - I don't. - Not even when you're asleep? No. - So, how owns this place? - 1do. You do? No, I don't. I forgot... Ilost it to a friend at blackjack. - Oh, you're gonna have to move now? - No. I'll win it back this afternoon. Where are you from? - What's your accent? - Guess. - Hmm... Russian. - Yeah. Listen... How would you like to make another four hundred? - Cleaning up the rest of your house? - No. A quickie. I don't think you're up for that! You're right, but I'm willing to try. I think you're gonna have a lot more luck with those girlies at the pool. You know, I've never fucked a cockroach killer before. Nice, I've never fucked a Russian! So? It's not your lucky day. Eight hundred. - Oh, Jesus, you're so desperate! - Yes, I am... Believe me, I am. Look, I have a lot of cleaning to do... So, you can help let me do my job... Or you can, you know, go screw, whatever... Okay. Okay, what? Alex! Oh, my God! - Are you feeling okay? - Yeah, I'm fine. Why? You look nervous. You like to take advantage of people, don't you? This is a lot of work for a hundred bucks. Why am I always such a sucker! - Uncle Oleg! - What? - Come out and play with us! - No, not now. - Please! - Not now! - Who're you? - She's a cockroach killer. - She is? Can we kill some cockroach? - No, not now! - Please! - Isaid no! Get out of here! - Please! - No, get out of here you little brads! - You're mean! - We don't like you anymore! Usually I like those kids. - What's the matter with me? - I don't know. "Lisa". - That could be a Russian name. - My grandparents are Irish. Kind of a shitty job for a girl named Lisa, isn't it? Yeah. It's a shitty job. You know what my favourite movie is? I've no idea. - "Microcosmos". - Never heard of it. It's a beautiful French movie about bugs. - You're kidding me. - No, I'm serious! I love bugs. I hate bugs. So? - Are you ready to get to work? - Yeah. Hi, Alex. - What are you doing up so early? - It's three o'clock in the afternoon. Are you busy right now? Can it wait until later? Sure. If this is it, Oleg, I'll say goodbye now. What are you talking about you old cheat! I have to play you again! I want my house back! Easy! It's too late. - One more bet? - Sure! You're not going to die. You're gonna lose this bet, too! The year was getting off to a bad start. For all I knew I was a dead man... Laying there gasping my last, 1 was still thinking about Oleg. He was up on the mountain, playing some fast cards... And I didn't know how much more he was gonna lose. Hey! What were you doing in there? - Who're you? - I'm asking the questions here. Who're you? - I'm the exterminator. - Yeah? Yeah. What were you doing in my brother's bedroom? I was looking for cockroaches, but there weren't any. Misty, but still beautiful. I hate the fog. It's depressing! Mama, you have to leave. The car is waiting. Tell him he's no longer my son. Alex and I will not visit here again. - Let's not part enemies. - Now go get Alex so we can leave. I love you Anna, but I don't take orders. You may think, I'm a gigolo, Oleg, but it is not so! I've been watching you. Your men, they can't protect you! You must hire people who know how to fight in the mountains. You must wire the borders. Booby trap they call it. Do you speak Russian. Okay. I'm a fighter, Anna. Oleg, come quickly! He's going to kill her! Come on! I'm a fucking exterminator! - They sent her to kill you! - It's not true! - It's not true! - I saw her coming out of your room! Now, she could have placed a bomb in there. So, stay out of your bedroom! I went to your bedroom because I was looking for cockroaches! Shut up! - I'm just doing my fucking job! - Oleg, [ know it's her! - Can't you see that? - It's so absurd! - She was searched when she arrived. - Yeah, by you! I was body searched, my whole fucking van was turned. He betrayed you, shut up! He made a call, right? He called her to kill you! He's fucking mad! Anna, Anna, come back! Please! Please! Somebody call the police! My God, what's going on? What are you doing with that gun? Untie that woman! - Stay out of this, mama! - Don't you dare talk to me that way! Oleg, listen to me, I'm your brother. - Can feel that you're in danger now. - Do something! - He's gone crazy! - I have to protect you! Then shoot her. What? - She came to kill me! Shoot her now! - Oh, my God! - Oleg, You're an animal! - I am, mamal Miguel, get her out of here. I've a little girl! She's six years old! - Do it. - Her name's Loril. - Do it! - Please, I'm begging you! Please! - Icant... - Why not? You're so sure she's the one. Why are you doing this to me? I can shoot her. Who are you? My name is Lisa Powell. Iwork for West Coast Exterminators. Please... - Don't hurt me. - Give me the gun. - It's your last chance. - No. - Shut up. - I was wrong. - Don't shoot her. - You sure? - Yes. - Please, just call my company. Just call the company and ask them. You wanna play with guns then you must be ready to kill! You understand? Kill and if you were wrong, fuck it, it's still the right thing to do! I'm sorry, do you have a Lisa Powell working for you? Just a second... She work for them. They said, she's out on a job in Malibu. Untie her. It seems we've made a mistake. But my brother thought he could be me for a day. A real Russian! Fuck you! I've never wanted to be anything like you! I hate you! You can take this house and this business, you shove them up your ass! - Why are you leaving? - What? - You have a job to finish. - Fuck off! I'm sorry. - Do you have another job now? - No, I don't. - Will you have a cup of tea with me? - No. You're crazy! I don't want to be alone right now. Well, the police will be here soon, so you'll have plenty of company! You wouldn't do that. You're right, I wouldn't. Where's Alex? How do you say? He's gone. Te llamo. - Hi. You go north for a while? - Sure. I'm not myself today, too much stress. What you're usually a better person? You don't believe me? No. I can prove it to you. Why brother? The world is full of liars, Lisa. When three people are talking, two of them are liars. That's a fact. What about when two people are talking? Do you wanna know, who's lying now? - Doesn't matter. - It matters. I lied a lot... it's very tiring, Lisa. So I decided to change my life. But I need Help. Can you help me, Lisa? I don't think so! Say to me: "Oleg, you can change". I don't even know you, it's... Just say those few words. Oleg, you can change. No, you didn't mean it. Oleg... You can change. What's going on? Let go of me! - She's fucking crazy! - Let me go! - I'm sorry! - Bobby, take the girls. - May I say something? - Yeah. Please, I advise that you to stay in the house until I secure the boundaries. - My men will be here tonight. - Okay. - Would you mind? - No, help yourself. I love caviar. I used to eat it all time. - So what happened out there? - People get excited at parties! You shouldn't leave your gun lying around. You're right. - Are you in trouble? - Maybe. - Bad? - Could be. I should go. No, stay. Why? I told you, I'm lonely. I need somebody. - 1l pay you! - How much? - How much do you want? - A lot. - And I'm not gonna fuck you. - It's a deal. Ilike being with you. I had so many plans for New Years Eve... - But everything was fucked up. - Mine wasn't so hot either! Can we start again? Unbelievably beautiful woman! What? I don't know how to explain... But you're a fucking unbelievable woman! - You look okay! - I'm trying! It's a little big. You look better in it than my ex-wife. Next drink. It's called a crazy Russian! - What's in it? - Champagne and vodka. Oh, God! You should make a wish. Okay. - What did you wish? - Iwished, I got my daughter back. Let's drink to your daughter. - What's her name? - Lon. - She doesn't live with you? - She lives with her foster parents. - Well... to Lori. - To Lori. What did he say? He wishes you good appetite. What is it? It's Russian pelmeni. In champagne sauce. How do you like your crazy Russian? It's dangerous! - Are you married? - No. Then we're both free people. I think, I'm a little drunk. - What is she doing here? - She was a gift. - From whom? - One old friend. - Am I a prisoner, Oleg? - Yeah, it looks that way. - Then, I guess I'm staying. - I'm glad. Oh, really? I wanna a guy, that's not gonna lie! Or cheat on me. Let's go to Tahiti? Okay, why not? - Lisa, open the door. - Leant.. Come on! Goodnight. Very professional. Job is done. I love that! Come here. Happy New Year and please leave a message. Oleg, your tow guys didn't make the flight. I thought you should know... They were found shot dead in the parking lot at the airport. You have aleak. - I've to go, now. Will you take me? - Where? - Mexico. - How much? - You do everything for money? - Not everything. Stop, please. - Did you finish the job? - Yes. Everything's fine? - Where's Oleg? - He's asleep. - Okay. - Okay. Abrame la rella! Pull over for a second. What's up? Ilike the ocean. I've been thinking about Tahiti. It wouldn't work out. Too many complications. Oleg! What? Look at me! You don't want to shoot me in the back? What are you waiting for? You should have killed me when you had the chance! Why? We had a good time, didn't we? You know what's funny. - What? - Think I love you. - Do me a favour? - What? It doesn't matter. - Give me a quarter. - What? Give me a quarter. I have a nickel. Heads or tails? Heads. Yeah? Job is done. God, where some people die... 1 guess he knew what he was doing. In the end who knows who wins and who loses. Me, I'm okay. The doctors gave me another six months on top of the six I already had. The life is beautiful, that's what Oleg used to say. I miss him... Funny thing about his house and the beach and the view. It can be foggy as hell in California. And most of the time you can't see a damn thing.
