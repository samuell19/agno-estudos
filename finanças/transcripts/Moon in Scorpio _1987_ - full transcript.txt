Moon in Scorpio... What does it mean? Moon in Scorpio... I don't know. Moon in Scorpio... ♪ Like a child longs for learning ♪ ♪ We waited for our time ♪ ♪ Rising brightly and gently ♪ ♪ Just as the Sun ♪ ♪ Our dreams like the morning will shine ♪ ♪ So please don't wake me till it's over this time ♪ Requested to complete their visits. All visitors are requested to complete their visits. Dr. Thompson, you're needed in the lab. Dr. Thompson, you are needed in the lab. Excuse me, could you help me for a second, I got a question for you. Excuse me, can you help me please? Hi, there. I work for a pharmaceutical company. I'm a salesman I was wondering if you could help me find... the entrance to the clinic? You do work here, don't you? What's the matter, oat got your tongue? Aagh! Dr. Kirkland, code blue in ward five. I'm sure you're both aware of the situation we have here. Aware is hardly the correct description. This incident is of such a nature that it could shake... the very foundations on which this hospital stands. The patient seemed fine. There was no outward signs of relapse... or any sign of agitation at all until that night. Damn, Vietnam war has certainly provided us with plenty of patients. What's the difference? If it's not the war... it's the goddamn arms race, nuclear pollution. Always something to drive people over the edge. Be that as it may... the handling of dangerous patients left in our charge... rests firmly on the shoulders of this staff. Now the police obviously have no clue... as to the patient's whereabouts. So, I've taken the initiative of bringing in... a private investigator to assist in the matter. I've hired Richard Vargas. Richard Vargas? He's almost crazy enough to be a patient here himself. Which is precisely why I brought him in. He knows how these people think, where they go. He may succeed where the police have failed. I seriously doubt it. And I seriously doubt if you're in any position... to be giving an opinion, nurse Mitchell. Besides, our reputation in this community is at stake. This is Richard Vargas from the Saint Annial Hospital. We're coming aboard. Going down below deck. Looks like we got a live one down here. Aaargh! I do hope you're feeling better today, Miss Carlisle. - Miss Carlisle? - Missus. Mrs. Allen Trumont. Beg your pardon, I didn't realize you were married. I'm widowed. Yes, doctor. Allen and I were married... in Oregon just a few days ago. Please forgive me, Mrs. Trumont... but I have to ask you a very difficult question. Yes. Do you remember trying to kill a man yesterday? Allen is dead. They're all dead, Mrs. Trumont. Your husband, his friends, all of them dead. Yes, I know they're dead! They're all dead, gone, finished. Please, Mrs. Trumont. I was there. I was on that boat. Yes, I know you were on the boat... and I know you've gone through a terrible ordeal... but please try to understand my situation. I'm trying to shed some light on what happened out there yesterday. Now I have to ask you again. Do you remember trying to kill a man who came on board the boat? I didn't kill them! I didn't kill them! I didn't mean to suggest that you did. What I'm interested in knowing is what happened. What happened out there? It was going to be our honeymoon, Allen's and mine. It turned out to be war. Another war for the survivors. Allen, Mark, and Burt, he said they were his friends... you see, his best friends. Three men living with... a war they couldn't forget. Like bombs going on inside their brain. See they had been in Vietnam together. You want to know what happened? I'll tell you what happened. My honeymoon turned out to be a nightmare on a death ship. Ghosts, ghosts popping up everywhere... and a killer sailing with us. Sick, this sick, brutal, barbarous assassin. Please, Mrs. Trumont, calm yourself. Now, I want you to sit calmly, and tell me exactly what you remember. Charlie one. Start pursuit. Charlie five, repeat you position. Three friends. These soldiers who were friends who had shared a great horror, a massacre. Women, children, and all of it for nothing. Mark, the quiet one, Burt, the good soldier, the man of action. And Allen, the man with all the doubts, the philosopher. Of course, I knew about Allen's time in Vietnam. Not all the details, but I knew there had been terrible, traumatic things that had happened to him there. Hold it, Burt, it's just a girl. She's a goddamn gook that wants to kill me. Jesus Christ, Burt! You're a pussy. Never call me a pussy. Afraid to die? No. You afraid to blow that bitch away? That's right, you pussy. It was the happiest day of my life. Allen and I were man and wife. We were very much in love, you know. Allen is... ...was the most unusual man I've ever known. The wonderful combination of great strength and great... sensitivity. The man I'd always dreamed of and I found him... and we were married, Mr. and Mrs. Allen Trumont... off to a beautiful life together... Now will you tell me what the surprise is? Surprise? Well, don't you remember? You'll see soon enough. I am going to make you the most beautiful salad you have ever tasted. Oh, god, baby what happened? Nothing, get me a band-aid. Why don't you let me clean it? I'll clean it for you. You're the strangest chick I ever met. Where the hell did I find you? I found you. Remember? Did I tell you the moon is going to be in Scorpio? No, you didn't. But who the hell cares. You better get that scratch bandaged up, Mark. You're gonna need all your strength for this boat trip. Oh, god I'm glad I'm awake. What is it? A really strange dream. It was about this person. Actually, it was a man, but I couldn't see his face. Did you know that you're forbidden... to dream about any other man from now on. Well, it wasn't about him. It was about this woman. She had a tongue like a snake. She was kissing him all over. It was scary. Sounds wonderful. - Oh, yeah? - Yeah. Ooh, like this? I'm trying to drive, honey. Allen, Allen, it's the police. Dammit. Troubles? No, officer, we just stopped to check the map. Where you heading? - California. - New York. Let me see your driver's license. Do you have any ID, ma'am? - She's my wife. - We just got married. Congratulations. If you're going to New York, it's back that way. If you're going to California, it's that way, west. But you can't stay here. Have a nice trip. - Thank you. - Thanks. I thought we were going to New York. Now I wouldn't lie to you about going to California... especially in front of an officer of the law. Is that the surprise? It's one of 'em. Oh, Allen, that's just great. I have nothing to wear in California. Hey, you won't need anything. - You're gonna be on a boat. - Oh, no don't tell me you booked us... on one of those Princess cruises. We are sailing to Acapulco. Acapulco! Good, I always want to go to Acapulco. We're gonna be sailing on my old buddy Mark's boat. A sailboat? What about your fear of water? Look, Linda, I wanna confront this fear and overcome it. But I don't wanna talk about it right now. Who else is gonna be on this boat? Burt and his girlfriend Claire and Mark and his new girl Isabelle. Oh, Burt and Mark, your old buddies, your old pals. They were my best buddies. I mean, we were in 'Nam together you know that. They were... but they're not now. I don't see why we have to go sailing on our honeymoon with those guys. Hey, what the heck, Isabelle made the invitation. Isabelle invited you. Oh, no, no, she invited both of us for our honeymoon. Honeymoon? Sounds more like an army reunion. Originally we planned on a trip to the East Coast Where I grew up. Allen had never spent anytime there. I want to share this honeymoon with you, just you and me. I didn't know that the plans had changed. Allen kind of sprang the news on me when we got into the car. News? What news? That Mark and Burt, and their girlfriends... had planned a cruise for us on Mark's boat. Allen's best friends. God, I should've known better. It was insane. I knew I should never have agreed to it. I mean it was madness, and it was all my fault. I mean, nobody, nobody goes off on their honeymoon with war buddies. I knew deep in my heart that it was a mistake... and it was all my fault. Now, Mrs. Trumont, it was not your fault. I should have known. I should have known. Should have known what? That Allen wasn't ready for it. He just wasn't ready for any of it. I saw him looking at something... and I realized it must be the pool. He was afraid of the water, for one. Something happened to him in the water over there. Come on, Allen, let's check in. I knew as soon as we were in our room, he wasn't himself. Wasn't himself? What do you mean 'wasn't himself'? No. His eyes would glaze over. Something else took over... some troubling memory... something to do with water. The pool. Something violent? Something horrible. Something that kept coming back to him. Why are you doing that? What? Cowering. I'm not cowering. I'm hiding. You're not afraid of me, are you? Afraid? Of course not. I'd never do anything to hurt you. I can't help what other people do. If someone is doing something wrong, you should obviously try and stop them. I did try. I didn't just stand there. I tried to stop them. Well, I am trying to start something here... and I need your help. What's the matter? Wait here a minute. I was scared for him, for both of us, but I let it go. Our honeymoon... could wait. The future was ours after all. So you dove into the swimming pool? You didn't try to find somebody to help him? Yes, of course. I wanted him to know that I was there. I thought that might help him. See after all, we were going out to sea... and I wanted him to know that he could count on me. Let me out of here! Let me out of here! You'll be sorry, I'm not kidding! Clean the head. Claire. Claire. Don't ever do that to me again. Don't ever talk to me like that again! What did you say? I said I loved ya. Burt, honey. Can't we go out? Can't we party? Here we are in the Marina with all these clubs and restaurants. I wanna go dancing. No dancing... and no party... and no fun. Look Claire, it's working. Burt, honey, I'll do something real nice for you if you take me out? Will you quit drinking? Yes. Will you quit swearing? Yes. And will you quit hitting me? Yes. You promise? I promise. Then I will take you out to dinner... right after I finish drying the dishes. See everybody gone be here tomorrow and... and I promised Mark we'd clean up his boat. Are you listening to me? And another thing, I want you to cutback on your drinking. Are you? Are you listening to me? Claire, I want you to be on your very best behavior... and not drink so much.

Well, shortly after he bought the farm... somebody broke into his house and ransacked the place. What does that mean? Williams lived in LA. So our patient has gone to Los Angeles? Exactly. So now what? So I'll go down there... and I'll see if any of the salesman's stolen property has been pawned lately. Maybe I can pick up a lead. Well, when you do, call me. And make it soon. I got your number, chief. Told you, he's nuttier than a fruitcake. Well, we felt happy, and both of us were now looking forward to the trip... water or no water. The ocean sure looks pretty at a distance. Look at that. Most things do. Allen. Hey, Allen over here. - How you doing? - How you doing? - Good to see you. - Give me a hand here. Welcome aboard you all. - You must be Linda. - And I'm Burt. - Hello. Here we are over here. Where's Mark? He's on the boat with Isabelle. I'll tell you something, she's really something else. He's got himself hooked up. Well, she's beautiful. But she has taken over. When I call him on the phone... she always answers and says he's not there. - So talk to him. - Sounds good to me, man. Well, this is it. Why don't you guys follow me. Come on. Allen, Linda this is Claire. Oh, hello, Claire. Can't you put your top on? We're not even out of the harbor yet. Well, don't look then. The floating honeymooners, welcome aboard. Though I can think of a lot better place to start a honeymoon... than on a bachelor's boat. Lay off the hooch, will you? The sun isn't even over the yardarm. Aye, aye, captain. We were admiring the boats. But the water's terribly dirty, isn't it? That's where the money for the boats comes from, honey. No dirty water, no money, right, Burt? Well, I wouldn't know, Claire. I don't deal in dirt. Let me show you where you sleep. Follow me. Come on, honey. Burt's gonna show us where we're gonna sleep tonight. You got it. Hey. - Hey. - How you doing, man? - God, I'm glad you could make it. - You haven't changed at all, man. You neither. - Hey, Linda. - Yes, hi. It's okay that I kiss the bride, huh? Well, now that you asked... He didn't give you a razor burn, did he? This is Isabelle. Yes, that's right. We spoke on the telephone. - Hi. - Hi. Hello. I'm Linda. Hi, Linda. I want you to make yourself at home. My boat is your boat. Alright, don't ask for anything. Anything you want is yours. Come on, why don't you go below, get yourself comfortable. Well, this is where you guys sleep. But I'm having a boat built, Allen. It's a lot bigger than this and the accommodations would be a lot better. You're not having any boat built. You haven't made a nickel in your life and you never will. I'll tell you what, Burt, if I had a rich old man, I'd be sitting right here with you. Well, maybe she'd rather my daddy didn't have any oil... and I'd have to work to survive. Maybe she does worry about pollution. Well, maybe she should stop polluting herself. Allen, why don't you just keep your stuff down here... and come up on deck and put it away later, huh? Oh, it was beautiful boat, and everyone seemed very nice. But I... I was uneasy. You remember the time Mark stole all of our beer. Sorry about that. What about those three young ladies that I met. Shh. - How's your new book coming? - It's coming along, almost finished. How's your personal life? Murder. What do you mean 'murder'? What'd you do kill somebody, Mark? My sister was raped and killed... in her own bedroom. Come on. Want to know how it happened? Exactly how it happened? First, he slit her throat so she couldn't speak. Then he put a pillow over her face to sop up the blood. Then he raped her, over and over again. He stabbed her, over and over again. Even while she was dead, kept stabbing her. These olives are good, you know. You want some? Well, who the hell would wanna do a thing like that and why? He was a vet like us. Said the war made him crazy. What happened to him? We got him all right. Made sure the same thing happened to him. - He got stabbed. - What, you raped him? You bet. What chapter is this new book, Mark? Oh, look, everybody. Burt cleaned his plate. Here kitty. I guess, I'll clear off the table. Here let me help you. No, it's alright, Claire. I can take care of it, thanks. What happened to Allen and Linda? It's their honeymoon. The first night, you know. I'm gonna go check on 'em. Well, looks like it's just the two of us. I think, you should go to sleep now. I'll just be a few minutes. Wait for me in bed. I tell you it was like the landing at Normandy beach. D-day at tuna beach. Christ, I never seen so goddamn many tuna fish. And all that blood. I tell you we were pulling in one every second. Yeah, what a fishing day that was, Unlike this. Well, I'm gonna pack it in. I'll see you later. Nice night out tonight, ain't it? Seen you on the boat there. It's a mighty great craft. You all taking off pretty soon? Hey. Hey, that's kind of neat. What is it? Oh, there you are. There's going to be a full moon tonight. Why don't we sail?

This is Khorda. - Good news, doc. - You found the patient? Close, found the stolen car. I should say the cops have found it. But where's the patient? I don't know. I figured that they must have gotten on one of these boats down here. I'm in a Marina. Well, you've got to find them. I'm working on it. I'll do a check on the Marina's log... see which boats have left out of here. I should be able to narrow it down pretty quick. Well, see that you do. This game has gone on far enough. Keep your shirt on, doc. I'm almost there. Well, thank god for that. So, we set sail. I watched Allen fighting his fear. I could tell he was struggling, but I thought he was doing better. So I didn't fret, I just kept an eye on him. The others didn't seem to know about his fear... or if they did, they didn't take it too seriously. They were doing their own thing. We were all trying to relax and get to know one another. I'll take over for you, a break. Thanks, Mark. Whoa! Allen! Take the wheel. You okay? - You gotta be careful, man. - I almost fell in the ocean. I know, we all gotta be careful. Suddenly something happened. Allen almost fell off the boat. I couldn't tell if it was Mark's doing or an accident, or his own fears working. But I started to feel that maybe all was not well between these old friends. You know, when I came home I went through the same thing you did, man. Yeah, one year. Then a friend of mine said "Go out into the ocean..." and I floated around for two weeks. And I started thinking. 'Do I wanna live?' 'Do I wanna live in the past?' How do you do it? You just get that thing inside you, man. You find that spot... and you don't let anybody beat you. I'll help you, huh? I'll help you. You got the boat, you got the ocean. You got a good woman by your side. It's gonna be fine, man. Stop looking for justice. Be your own justice. I started resenting the fact that we were here on this boat. I started resenting the whole thing. I wanted to be with Allen on our own somewhere else. Did you know I had plans to be in New York right now? Really? I even had a list of all the shows I wanted to see. Les Miserables, Little Shop of Horrors. Is that so? I had no idea we were going on this boat trip. Well, then this is a big surprise. And I don't like surprises. I like everything in order according to my own plans. I don't like to be on this boat. Well, why are you telling me all this? Because you invited us, and I wondered why? The sails are down. We'll just drift around awhile. Drift? Well, it's standard procedure. We'll drift about six miles out of course and tomorrow I'll bring us back on. Things were better by the afternoon. Everyone seemed to be trying to smooth things over... you know, the tensions of the day. There was a brief moment of peace. Didn't last long. I'd like to propose a toast. To my dear friend, who's like a brother to me... and I'm real glad you're here and his beautiful wife. Welcome aboard, Allen. Thank you, Burt. Not bad. Hey, Claire. What? Honey, don't put that gin on the ice cream. Why don't you cutback on the ice cream 'cause it's not good for your figure? Shut up. You should talk, you look like a beached whale... the way you walk around this boat pulling your pants up... because they won't fit over your fat gut. You drink too much. Oh, really? Well, have some more then. Have some more ice cream, and have some more booze. Okay, I will. - Yeah, have some goddamn more. - I will, watch me. - Ooh, it's about to the very top. - Aye. Let's see how fast you can drink it? Let's see how floored you can make me one time. Back off. You know, you should talk, Burt. Not only are you a physical loser, you're stupid. I'm telling you don't eat anymore of that. Watch me. Come on see. And watch this. Let's see how high I can fill it. Let's see how fast I can drink it. Somebody want a piece of cake? I'd love it. Have some yourself. - Come on. - Here's to you. Here's to nothing. Why don't we cut the cake, huh? Come on. I'll cut it for you. Look, I guarantee you, you give her sometime by herself... and tomorrow morning everything's gonna be all right. Guaranteed. Why don't we just turn around in the morning and go back? What are you kidding? Don't worry about Claire, she'll be fine. Why don't you say we turn in? Oh, yeah, the sun really took a lot out of me today. Hey! Hey, what about the cake? You eat the cake. I'll go to bed, yeah. - I'm going to sleep. - I'm too full. Claire! Claire, it's time for beddy-bye. Claire! Claire! Time for beddy-bye. I've had it with you, Burt. Stop it, leave me alone! The moon was full and I remember listening... to the peaceful sounds of sea water on the hull. Cut it out, Burt. Oh, cut it out, Burt! I said out it out! The next day was gorgeous. I woke up feeling wonderful. Everything looked fresh and calm... and I noticed that Claire wasn't there. Where is Claire? Probably sleeping. Oh, I'll go and wake her up. You know what they say about guys with big feet? It's true. Like my foot? I can't find her. I'll check it out. She was gone. Vanished. There was no sign of what might have happened. Nothing. Suddenly all my... my fears came back. My sense of foreboding. Something terrible was going on right under our noses. Dr. Boyer, you're wanted in... Where was it leading us? Who was behind it? You are wanted in the emergency room. Where was it going to end? Who knew where it was going to end? Did you, Mrs. Trumont? Did you know? You're a fool, doctor! I didn't know anything! But did you kill Claire? No, I didn't kill Claire. Didn't kill anyone. Something had taken possession of that boat... a killer spirit, a possessed soul, one who liked to kill. Mark. Hey, Mark, she's not down there. Get on the radio and get a hold of the coast guard, will you? Shit. Mayday, mayday. Mayday, this is the up priority. Do you read me? Dammit. What's the matter? The radio is dead. What do you mean the radio is dead? Give me the toolbox. It's in that cabinet behind you. Do you read me? Mayday, mayday. This it? It was like someone had woven a spell... that was coming over the boat, an evil curse. Mayday, mayday. Do you read me? Is this it? You better go upstairs and see your husband, he doesn't look too well. Mayday. Do you read me? Allen. Allen, are you alright? Of course, not. I can't find Claire. No, I mean, have you been sick? No, why? I feel so horrible about Claire. I've never been in a situation where someone... fell overboard or died or anything. And all that drinking and arguing. Keep looking, Isabelle. The radio's not working, I'm gonna go check the antenna. What about the auxiliary? Somebody tampered with it. Now, who the hell would mess with the radio? Maybe Claire. She was kind of drunk last night. You know you've been tough on her, you should take care of her a bit. Shit, Mark. That's my goddamn business. Everything on this boat is my business. Claire is goddamn overboard, Mark. She's overboard, you hear me? Pick up the sails. Come on! Forget about that we'll use the engine. All of a sudden there was no radio, no main sail. There's no key. No key to the motor. We were adrift, helpless. Are you afraid of the water? Death was well served that day. What do you mean death? The day when the village was attacked. The people did not die willingly. Mark told you about that? The moon is in Scorpio. What do you mean by that? Many things. Revenge. Retribution. It is a time of great light and great darkness. No one can be trusted. Who are you? You know very well who I am. So what are you hoping to find down there? See if anything's caught in the prop. I'm not leaving till we find her. I had a feeling something bad was gonna happen. But what if we don't find her? Tell Mark to take us back, okay? We're not going to find her. We knew she was dead. Everyone knew that. It was like a huge weight over all of us. So Mark dove into the sea hoping to find something underneath the boat, right? Well now, weren't any of you suspicious? The girl was dead! Well, yes. Um... I did think... that Burt... you know, he'd done something stupid. They were at each other like two roosters all the time. We all had a heavy heart and wandered around below deck... like zombies, numb and afraid. We were right to be afraid. Prop's clean. Hey, what the hell are you doing? Burt! Burt, come here, I think something's happened to Mark. What's the matter? - It's Mark, I don't see any sign of him. - What do you mean? He's not on board? Well, he was here. Dammit. He must be overboard. I'd better go down and check on him. Oh, Burt, please be careful. Please. Jesus Christ, Mark. Oh, God, [knew he was gone, dead. Mark was dead now just like Claire. Somebody was doing this to us. Somebody was killing us one by one. One by one. - Come on up. - I didn't see a trace of him. But he's gotta be down there. You wanna go down there and look for yourself? - Oh, no, no. - I didn't think so. Well, what are we gonna do? We're going to drift. That's when I started suspecting everybody... a death ship, a drifting death ship. Don't you feel it, Linda. The vibes on this boat are terrible. My dreams were worse than ever last night. I can feel evil. It's inside me. It's inside all of us. I look up at this boat, and I see a coffin. I look at that sail like a shroud. You're driving yourself crazy. Now you think I'm crazy, huh? Some honeymoon. What time is it? It's 10 o'clock. The moon is in Scorpio, you know? What's that supposed to mean? It's a time of trouble, anger, and fear. It's a beautiful moon. Is that for Allen? No, it's for me. Allen's asleep. Well, I swear he's still a little kid. He's still afraid of the dark? And you're not? No, I'm not. What about you, Isabelle? Aren't you afraid? What do I have to be afraid of? The Moon is in Scorpio, you know. Well, I'm going to bed. You know, you're the weirdest person I ever met... with the exception of Allen. Where the hell did you come from? I said where'd you come from? You know where I'll be. I'm going to bed too. Allen, Allen, what are you trying to do? Allen, Allen, what are you trying to do? Are you trying to kill me? Oh, my god, I'm sorry. I have to get some air. Allen tried to strangle me. He was having a nightmare, but I didn't know what to think anymore. He had tried to strangle me. Then he left. Went up on deck, he said he needed to breathe. Allen? Allen? Allen! It's over, Mrs. Trumont. The nightmare is over. You're alive. You've survived the most cunning, and dangerous killer... this hospital has ever had to deal with. He was right. Allen was right. We're doomed, all of us. It was like a coffin. I want to live. I don't want to die! Mrs. Trumont, please. I'm married now. I want children. Mrs. Trumont, calm yourself. I wanna live, I want my husband, I want Allen! Mrs. Trumont, please. Now, please sit down. You're safe now. Everything's going to be all right. Yes. You'll see life will begin again for you. It will be good to you this time. You're a beautiful woman. You have a good life ahead of you.
