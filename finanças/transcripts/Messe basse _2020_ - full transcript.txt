THE LODGER FOR MY BELOVED FATHER 20 YEARS LATER Sugar? Not for me, thanks. You're moving here for your studies, is that right? Yes. I want to be a nurse. So thanks for renting me the room. Do you know anybody here? No one. I went to school in the Vendée. Oh, where? Saint-André-Goule-d'Oie. Funny name! Where exactly is it? No one has ever heard of it. It's in the middle of nowhere. There must be some tourist site or local curiosity. No. Yes, there's a big rock in a field, balanced on another. It moves if you push it. People like to have their photo taken with it. -It sounds original. -Yes! You know, Julie, this is a pleasant town but it's full of students and there's a lot of temptation for girls like you, which can hamper your studies. Don't worry, I seldom go out. Neither do we. I go to bridge once a week, otherwise Victor and I stay quietly at home. It's crazy out there. Julie, I think Victor has caught cold. He's just taking a hot bath. I'll pop to the pharmacy. When he's done, be a dear and clean up the bathroom. Thanks! Thanks for tidying up. Everything is perfect! It's only natural. Talking to you cheered him up. Who? Victor. He told me all about it. He thought it was so funny that you tried on his cap. I hope it hasn't made you want to switch careers. No. Don't tell me that's your dinner. At your age, you need to eat. And we have steak and kidney pie. Serve yourself some. No, thanks, I'll be fine. Oh, have some, just to please me. I forgot my pancakes. You should have asked for a knife and fork. I knew you'd like it! Yes, it was delicious. I'll pack you some in Tupperware, for tomorrow. No! No need. There's nothing to heat things up with there. Even cold, it's delicious. While I get that ready, be a dear and take that to Victor for me. Oh, sorry. Quiet! Please calm down and pay attention. Remember inexpensive dummies are on sale at the campus store that will allow you to practice at home. You. Show us the correct protocol when washing a noncommunicating patient. Here's the care plan and all the patient information. Pretend it's a real person. Hello, Mrs. Boisseau. My name is Julie, I'll be washing you today. Let me pull the cover down. I'll remove your glasses. Now close your eyes. Relax. I'll start to rinse you down. Don't worry, I'll be very careful. ENJOY! Want to play? No. Only I saw you grab my ball, so... I'm just kidding. It's gone everywhere. A real mess. Wait, what is this? Is it edible? Yes, it's steak and kidney pie. It's English. Does it wash off, from your hands? I hope so! What's your name? Julie. That's cool. I'm Manu. -You're studying medicine? -Nursing. -You do medicine? -Yep. Hey, Manu, come on! I'm coming! Here. Have you nothing else to eat? I can go fetch you something. -No, thanks. -Sure? So you're not eating! I wasn't very hungry. Well, Julie, see you around. Hey, chill! Julie, come see! It's sensational. Beautiful, isn't it? Do you recognize it? It's Saint-André-Goule-d'Oie. Your rock. It seems your story inspired Victor. He knows what it means to be far from home. I think you're his new source of inspiration. But let's be clear, his favorite subject is his wife. Victor! You'll soil the chair! I don't think I've ever seen him without paint stains. Sometimes he annoys me. But after 50 years, it's not going to drive us apart. You're drenched! Oh no, I'm fine. You can't stay like that. Sit down. This will relax you. You'll never feel cold again in this. I couldn't, it's too nice. Of course you can. I have lots of others. Anyway it suits you. Victor bought it for me in London. It was always a little tight on me. Amazing, it's like new. Oh, it isn't new! I've only worn it once or twice. Thank you. It's beautiful. Well, thank you. Very much. It was nothing. Very much. It was a pleasure to bring you home on my bus-boat. Likewise. Captain. "Likewise, Captain." Ah! Likewise, Captain. Or rather "Sir." At ease. So you live here, with your parents? No, I live with an elderly lady. -But I won't stay for long. -Why not? Because... Elizabeth is a little unusual. You mean...? No. No, it's nothing. She's just rather old. Okay. -Well, see you soon. -Yes. -Bye. -Bye. Sorry. Are you coming to the Pharma party? I don't know. Come along, it might be fun. Okay, I'll see. Work permitting. Hello. -You're the new girl? -Yes. Living here really isn't a good idea. -You should find somewhere else. -Why? It doesn't bother you that my mother chats with a suit? No, of course not. Actually, do you know why she's like that? After the accident, she never accepted my father's death. You really ought to find another place. But your mother is so kind to me. It's good for her to have help. If there's ever any problem... call me. Thank you. Don't believe everything she says. Elizabeth. She said some horrid things! Come and rest. I need to clean up. It's nothing, leave it to me. Come to your room. Thank you for the flowers. Good night. Julie! Victor has just got home. Come and give us a hug. Just one day apart is too much for us. Fortunately it doesn't happen often. It's true but... it wasn't always like that. He used to go away for long spells. He loves his job so much. Forging links with Brazil. He loves that country. He even suggested we move there. But my whole life is here. On day, I told him I couldn't go on this way. What did he say? He accepted it, out of love. That's a photo from his last trip. He sent it to me to tell me he was returning. See how happy he looks. Ever since, we've never been apart. HELLO THERE, LAD. I HOPE YOU CAN JOIN US TOMORROW NIGHT! Elizabeth? Yes? Lunch is ready. We'll be right there. He loves his food. See how pleased he looks. Is all well in the studio? Don't ask, all that posing exhausts me. Victor has convinced himself that I'm prettier with bare shoulders but I get so cold! I'm sure he'll do a beautiful painting of you, as usual. You're right. I'm unbearable. I don't know how he paints such pretty pictures from such a model. You're a beautiful woman, Elizabeth. I do alright for my age. But when Victor paints me... it's something else. I've become his creation. Do you have a lover, Julie? -No. -Well, well. What does that little smile mean? You're hiding something. No, really, I don't have anyone. Julie, don't be like other young people, who have lost all sense romanticism. Isn't love... the most beautiful thing there can be? You deserve a beautiful romance. I need to tell you about some important plans. The 21st is our golden wedding anniversary, mine and Victor's. 50 years of marriage. Just think! I want to surprise him. I'd like to give him some nice scent. He loves that. But at my age, my nose isn't as sensitive as yours. I'll go. And I'll fix a meal too. I can put my dress on. -What do you think? -You look delightful. Thank you so much, Julie. You're an angel. Whatever you do, not a word to Victor. I promise. Hey, Julie, are you okay? -Good, you? -Yeah. A drink? Yeah, I wouldn't mind a... soda? A soda...? A soda! I'll fetch you one. Can you dance? It's a slow number. It's not like we're getting married. Biggus Dickus, the Pharma god, bids a welcome to the newcomers! I demand 20 victims: virgins and maidens. -I don't want to! -We have no choice. Maidens, on your knees. Micro Dickus. Ready for the handout? -Of course! -Let's go. You're impatient to start but no cheating will be tolerated. Everyone is ready? Yeah! Wait! Will you do it? Now what's this? Someone is defying Biggus Dickus! For those who haven't understood, the first be-sheathed banana wins. Three, two, one... let the orgy commence! You really have an amazing wife. Your love is beautiful. My mother should have done the same. When my father died, she threw away all his things. Burned all his photos. She thought that forgetting would stop her suffering. Instead of that, she sank into grief and never got over it. But in your case, it's as if she never lost you. It's funny actually, I feel your presence a bit more every day. I've seen your vacation videos. There's one where you're reading on the beach. Is it in Brazil? This port is really good. Did I drink yours? I need to stop. When I think about that seedy campus and all those pathetic guys. You should have seen them. THE SEA ROUTE BY JORGE AMADO Julie? Yes, Elizabeth? What's going on? I heard a noise. Don't worry, it was just the wind. Ah. Good night. Good night. My love, I yearn to hold you in my arms, I know you suffer in my absence. Crossing the oceans used to bring me so much pleasure, now leaving you is unbearable to me. But I have made up my mind, I want to live beside you every day. The promise of it keeps me going until the moment I can once again look into your face. Okay, Julie? I'm sorry about the other night. I know I screwed up. Don't worry. Anyway I was tired. I saw this in a store, it reminded me of the boat-bus. Thank you. Can I buy you lunch tomorrow? -I can't. -Wednesday? I'd rather we didn't see each other. Okay. May I help you? Yes, sorry. I'm looking for some scent for a friend. Any particular brand? No, I don't know. I saw you looking at "Emprunte". It's a scent for... determined men, who demand the best. Ooh, it's powerful. Yes, like I said. No, that won't do. Alright, may I ask your friend's age? Well, that's hard to say. 20? 40? 60? 80? No, not that old. Okay, how about "Panorama"? Rock 'n' roll, stylish, a hit with young men. Do you have anything less violent? Less sporty, you mean? It's just that he's pretty timeless. He's an artist, he travels a lot. He's in his own world. At the same time, he's rather... unsettling. How about this one? BRAZIL HEART Pass it on. Sorry. Everyone ready? We'll pick up from where we stopped. I'm going to the hairdresser's. Victor is so glad to be having tea with you. He doesn't know about the anniversary party. Don't breathe a word! No. Victor, are you there? The book yesterday, was that you? Did you want me to find the letter? "The promise of it keeps me going until the moment I can once again look into your face." Victor? What's going on here? Mrs. Dardelin! What's this music? What have you done to him? Take this. My darling! It'll be fine, it'll be fine. I just wanted to play him some music. These things are reminders of a past he must put behind him. At a certain age, you need to forget, or else live with open wounds. Julie! Yes? Come and join us. Do you like port? I think so. It's Villas-Boas. Our favorite port. Thank you. It's a very rare wine. I imagine you've never had anything like it. No. Julie, I'm sorry, I need to sort out something that might make you uncomfortable but I've always disliked ambiguous situations. We had a long chat this afternoon. Victor confessed to me... that it was he who suggested a dance. Victor, I think you have something to say to Julie. You promised. Summon up your courage. I'm sorry, Julie. That's good. I'm proud of you. I know he can sometimes be insistent with the ladies. At his age, I understand the need for reassurance. That's one less. Julie. Yes? Julie? Yes? Is Elizabeth with you? No, she must be in her room. Ah, okay. Julie? Yes? I loved dancing with you yesterday. You're not saying anything. I don't know what to say. I'm alone. You can speak without fear. You touch me deeply. You make me feel alive. How about you? What are your feelings? I... I don't know. You inspire me, Julie. You make a beautiful model. May I ask you a question? Yes. What do you think of me? Attractive. Really? I'm pleased. Elizabeth? Victor? I know you're there. Give me a sign, something, anything! I swear I'll understand. What are you trying to tell me? Right, so... Funny, he really reminds me of someone. Isn't it Mr...? -Dardelin. -Dardelin, yes! I remember him coming when my dad ran the store. We used to frame the portraits he did of his wife. I think the poor woman has gone crazy since. Sorry, maybe you're related. Not at all. A customer's daughter worked for her and told me some awful stories. What happened? I don't remember exactly but it ended very badly. There! Here. Where have you been? Do me a favor and get rid of all this. I'm going to bed. -What about our dinner? -I've already eaten. But your surprise... What surprise? Your anniversary. The girl who had that room before you went out every night, got up at lunchtime every day. How I laughed the day the results came out. Refocus on your studies, Julie. unless you want to return to your country home. Pervert! Get out of my room! Victor! Aren't you ashamed? What are you doing, sniffing underwear? Are you fucking her, like you did the other one? I won't tolerate it! She makes me sick! Disgusting! Elizabeth? What do you think? Not bad for a 73-year-old. I want to be exciting too. I can arouse men too! THINKING OF YOU. SEE YOU TONIGHT. VICTOR. You need to forget, or else live with open wounds. "Crossing the oceans used to bring me so much pleasure, now leaving you is unbearable to me." The letter wasn't received. It's a letter you never sent. I won't let you leave me. You can't, I love you! Victor, no! Julie? Julie! What have you done to your hair? Don't you like it? Clean up downstairs, I must get ready for my bridge tournament. I'm going out tonight too. I've no time for your stuck-up old woman's problems. How dare you talk to me that way! Didn't you say I deserve a beautiful romance? You're right. It's the most beautiful thing anyone can experience. Get out! Don't worry. We're leaving tonight. You slut! Hello. Delivery for Mrs. Julie Moreau. Does she live here? Yes. Great. Please sign here, with your finger. Thank you. There. Goodbye. WITH ALL MY LOVE, VICTOR Lying vixen! Julie? And don't come back, bitch! I won't be home late. Mrs. Dardelin, you're wanted on the phone. Excuse me. Hello? Hello? Who is this? Good evening, Elizabeth. Julie, stop playing games. You feel no remorse? You don't care that you killed me? My coat, please. But the match isn't over... I wish to go home! Victor? Victor, please... open the door. We swore we would be together for life. I didn't mean to hurt you. I'm sorry. I'm sorry you had to go through all that. Don't blame yourself, she was sick long before she met you. She must be happy to be with him again.
