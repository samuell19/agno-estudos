Ready for the shot? Congratulations. Welcome to Arista. - Thank you. - Thank you. Cissy. Thank you. Thank you, Clive. John. Thank you. Thank you very much. Congratulations. Now, if you don't mind, I want to get acquainted with my new artist and learn about her musical tastes. Okay. Alone would be great. It's what I was trying to-- Okay. Yeah. So, do you write songs? No. Have you ever tried? Mm-mm. Is that okay? Yeah. We'll just get people to write them for you. Now, what kind of songs do you like? Hm. Great big songs. "Great big songs"? Yeah. All right, great big songs. Yeah, that you almost can't wrap your arms around. Songs that are like climbing a mountain, that'll stretch me vocally, that-- I really gotta sing my raggedy ass off to sell. Gospel? Country? Black? White? All the above. All the above? Mm-hm. All of them. A great song is a great song. And you are 100% correct on that. Okay. So, then, what we're gonna do is we're gonna hire the finest songwriters in America-- In the world, to write a great big vocally-ambitious song for a great new vocally-ambitious star. What do you think? Believe they'd do that for me? No. But they'll do it for us. Okay, so-- Can I-- Can I ask you something? Yeah, you can ask me anything. I'm an open book, Whitney, just so you know. Even though people say that the text size is so small that you need very strong glasses. What do you wanna know? You went to Harvard? Law, yeah. What was that like? Well, stressful. Actually, anxiety attacks. I had-- Right here, darling. Sure. Thank you so much. Thank you. You're welcome. But, you know, you work through it. I worked through it. How? Uh, how? Exercises. Breathing exercises. I do that too. Yeah, but I did it, of course, you know, away from everyone because-- You know, you have to remember that in those days, and this was a long time ago-- In those days, you couldn't admit that there was ever anything wrong with you. And can you now? I want to tell you one thing, dear Whitney, before we begin. I never get involved in the personal lives of my artists. I am not a babysitter, I'm not a camp counselor, I'm not a rabbi. I know music. I have an ear, and I have an instinct. And in this respect, I can serve you. And I will be there for you at any hour. Okay? Okay. To you. Congratulations. Thank you. Mm. Okay. Let's test that ear. He said he can get me on TV, and we drank champagne. And, Mommy, he called me "vocally ambitious." You let her come out looking like this? She ain't got a dress? She needs to start wearing a dress. I told her to dress up. Why? These are my nice jeans. Nice jeans? Yeah, well, it's just me. Yeah, well, they don't wanna see "just you," and being Nippy ain't gonna get it. And you need to take her wig shopping. If she's gonna go all the way, hair short as mine is not going to get it done. You're a princess. With that voice and the looks, you could be America's princess. Start looking like one. Tough business, baby, I know. I'm just gonna sing.

And good night! Well, it's a criticism I increasingly hear from callers. That I'm not Black enough? No, your music. Your music isn't Black enough. What would you like me to say? The truth. Aren't you selling out? Whew. You've got a lot of nerve asking me that. That's what my mother tells me. It's a valid question. A common criticism of you and your music. That you're a sellout. That you're not a real Black artist. You're about to walk out, aren't you? No. You'll be walking out before I will. How do you respond? If I'm not a Black artist, what am I? You tell me. Look, I don't know how to sing Black, and I don't know how to sing white either. I know how to sing. Music is not a color to me. It has no boundaries. Why somebody gotta say something dumbass like that? I mean, who said that? That's just bull. And it makes me angry, actually. It's hateful and uninformed. Why I gotta be what someone wants me to be anyway? Sing what I want to sing. Be how I want to be. Reach as big an audience as I can. Isn't that what art's meant to do? My whole life, "She ain't Black enough. She ain't white enough." Well, how about, "She's not obedient enough"? How about, "She ain't fearful enough"? Hm. Hm. Well, you heard it from Whitney herself, ladies and gentlemen. Was that too much? Hell no. All right. Morning, Max. Mr. Houston. Look at this. Here you are. Good morning. Thank you. Use it wisely. Anna. Are you a businesswoman? Yes, I think so. What does a businesswoman do? Well, what does a businesswoman do? She says what she doesn't want. - Good morning. - And she knows, primarily, what she wants. That's a pretty tough thing to have to determine sometimes, you know? Most of the people that work with me, the people I have known for many years, you know, they're people, competent people I can trust to look out for me and to do their job well. But it's hard sometimes to make the transition from being the friend to the boss or from the boss to the friend. Or from the daughter to the boss or the boss to the daughter. You know, you have to wear different hats at times. So, you are a tough cookie? Sometimes. Always? Not always, no. Sometimes. That means sometimes. Daddy, what is it? I want you to fire her. Robyn is a nobody. The Bible tells us, "Do not be misled. Bad company corrupts good character. Walk with God, not the devil." Daddy... I need her gone. Daddy, there is nothing going on. She is a bad influence. And the press is talking too much trash. It's damaging the brand. Do you understand? Since when-- Since when did your little girl become "the brand"? I missed that. Your mama would have killed to become a brand. We just couldn't get her there. I'm not firing Robyn. I need her. I need somebody I can trust 100%. You can trust me 100%. Or you better damn do. Now you go do as I tell you. I'm the manager here. I know you are. You work for me. You don't say. Daddy... ...I do. How is that, to become the boss of your own family? Of your brothers and their wives? Of your own father and mother? Or are you still the "little girl" sometimes? Sometimes. Now, look here, you stupid, little broad. Don't you talk to me like that. I'll talk to you any way I like. You know who I am? You think I let dames get away with anything? Yes? Clive, I wanna do a movie. What? A movie. Why? We'll find you a movie. Sure. Okay. Night. - You didn't ask but you wanted. - I did my share. What about you? Who do you think you are, you can be so particular? You're nothing. You get funny with me, and I'll throw you right back to that crummy dance joint where I found you. How are you feeling? Here she comes. Whitney! There she is. Whitney "Whitey" Houston! Whitney "Whitey" Houston! Pay no attention. Come on. Shame on you! Shame on you! Whitney "Whitey" Houston! Whitney "Whitey" Houston! Who was that? I don't know. Come on. No, I don't wanna talk to nobody. Mrs. Houston! Just stay focused. Keep it together. What's going on?

What the--? What are you doing? Yo, I'm not even playing around, man. You better chill. I'm not. Hey, hey, hey. What's up? Oh, no. I'm so sorry. I'm really sorry. You're Bobby Brown, right? Yeah. Yeah. What about it? I got a question for you. And what's that? How old are you? Old enough. He's old enough. He's old enough, you know. He's old enough. Ladies and gentlemen, our host, Anita Baker. She looks so good. So good. The nominees for the best music video are... Janet Jackson, "Control," Michael Jackson, "The Way You Make Me Feel," Whitney Houston, "I Wanna Dance With Somebody," Whoo! Jody Watley, "Looking For A New Love." Are they booing me? And the winner is... The winner is Janet Jackson, "Control." Keep it together. Hey, hey. Don't even worry about it. You're Whitney Houston. All right? They dogs. Give me a pen and a business card. You got to be prepared. You know, the kind of success that you're enjoying, that the Black stations ain't got no control over and they don't own, it drives 'em crazy. Oreo. They calling me an Oreo. If they wanna see Black, I'll show 'em Black. No, you don't. Don't you go changing nothing. You keep on doing what you doing, 'cause what you doing ain't nobody ever done before.
