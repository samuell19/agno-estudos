A T THE BEGINNING OF TIME, MAN WAS GIVEN DESIRE- SO THA THE COULD DISTINGUISH- ILLUSION FROM REALITY. Väinämöinen! sampo, my son. What news? Many warships are coming, with many men. They are from Pohjola. Louhi is a powerful woman. she has created in her mind- a world into Pohjola where material things are valued. Will there be war, Väinämöinen? Will they destroy the village of Kalevala? Many have drunk from the cup that has no wisdom. Let us go to Smith Ilmarinen. He forges the shapes of our minds. And blows life into iron and bronze. THE SAMPO NEEDED TO BE FORGED. Bring me the sampo, the miracle mill. It is our key to wealth. Whoever lays it at my feet will get an armful of silver- and one of the daughters of Pohjola to wed. When morning dawns we will storm the gates. Thor! Thor! Thor! FINLAND 20 1 3. You brought me here just for this? -You have to see it. There is only beautifully woven illusion. Imaginations of our damaged minds- that produce happiness just one short moment at a time. What is this? -A lecture about the spirit. A study of what life is all about. We have woven the world around us- and make-believe that it is true. But everything is just a beautifully woven illusion. Which also- is just make-belief. Our imagination. The conquerors of the world are waiting there- and their CEO doesn't bother coming to work on time. I've been clearing things out. -Are you crazy? Don't you realize that it's all clear? sorry, I have some suspicions. Be as sick as you like, but don't screw this up. Try to stay sharp. Kurt will cut you some slack, you are his son. I'm not his son. We've taken over most of the banking business in this country. We transferred our national treasures, the crown jewels, to the Swedes. And the People's Bank is now owned by the Danes. We have our man in the Union- and in the governing bodies of international trade. We can already control most of the European Internet and money traffic. Our CEO needs to be punctual. sorry, I was meeting with Wahlroot from the legal department. He's an old hand at selling Finnish assets. Even he is worried. sampo, you can't get cold feet at this proud moment- when I am about to present something unforeseen. When the new biometric wireless links are brought to people's use- an era of new networking will begin for humankind. Through biometric authentication- our machine can automatically get in contact with the human mind. And as a bonus, their bank accounts, schedules, porn sites, are accessed,- everything that today's machine of consumption requires. It is perfect virtual reality. We sell reality that people can adjust to their liking. Excuse me, but shouldn't we look at the matter more deeply? Why are you pitching only for virtuality at a time- when we should be bringing people closer to reality? What? You think you're some kind of a prophet of business life? The sails are set already, Sampo. We have our ways. You have to remember, The swedish Brotherhood has a lot of power. I'm warning you. -About what? You wanna make us all poor? -Might teach you a lesson. Jokkeri! Tell them Sampo's woman is in labor. -Okay. What's troubling you? I know the situation is intense- but it happens in big families, we just have to deal with it. We don't want to upset the Brotherhood. We all know what that could mean. Are you threatening me? -Look at the real facts. Don't turn your eyes inward. You won't find anything there. Even the philosopher Karl Marx believed- that the structures of economy regulate human consciousness. You won't find any spirit in this world. Only material- shaped by capitalistic practice. THE BEGINNING Louhi, why do you bring a message of war? Kalevala hasn't sought power, nor taken it from anyone. We have no riches. You know we live only for knowledge. Ilmarinen, is it true- that you have forged a miracle mill that can fill every desire? It is true that Ilmarinen has forged a miracle mill. It is a masterpiece, with the power of iron and force of the human mind. Never has anyone seen the likes. We want it. If you give it to us we won't burn down your village. You can't have the sampo. You stupid old man can't see what is happening in the world. A new time has begun, with new thoughts, a great storm. We will take the sampo and burn your village down. Antti... You walked over me. It was an accident. Riitta is in labor. I'm sorry, I didn't see you. Are you hurt? sampo... What's wrong with you? I don't know. You have to pull yourself together. Your future wife needs support, not weakness. I'm not under your care anymore. -You didn't want it. I don't know what I want. Things just happen. Everything I do is out of my control. Is it because of the baby? -We're not playing it clean anymore. I'm scared. -Of what? This is the happiest time of your life. Don't be scared of having a child. It's an opportunity. I'm talking about the firm! You always get it wrong. Aino... I just got the message. It gave me such a fright. No need to worry. The child is safe and all is well. THE PAST What do you think about the genealogy chart I had made? We're almost royalty. That's all? -Want me to become a count? My family can be traced all the way back to Harald Fairhair. Father says we hail from Väinämöinen. -He's told you that bedtime story too. Harald Pantyhose, like all the other scandinavian kings,- descended from the in Finns, the kings of Karelia and Kainuu. You're mocking me. -Perhaps. But we're stuck on a history written by our conquerors- and unable to prove our own interpretation of that history true. How would you know? -Father told me. Leave him out of this. Don't even mention his name. Your father is full of shit. -Nice black pudding. I hear you want to resign from the executive board. You do understand that's impossible? Nothing's impossible. Of course it would complicate things- and certain parties could get upset. But it's not an impossible thought. Kurt will never allow it. Aino. What are you doing here? -I invited her. I thought it would be nice to get together. Just a small family gathering. since when has Aino been part of the family? since the beginning. Before you started tagging Riitta along. You two have always been close. I would have wanted to see you as a couple. Even when you were little, you loved playing together. shouldn't you be reconsidering some of your choices in life? I am. Riitta came along and she's pregnant. so much for that. Things happen. This is inevitable. I have to tell you, you'll be passed over as an heir- if you don't start thinking with your brain. I wouldn't want that to happen, but you leave no choice. You have to understand, there's a lot at stake here. I can't believe this. Kurt with his threats, and now you're blackmailing me. Fucking hell! I'm not a moppet. ILLUSION Did your father send you to kill me? Lower your bow, Louhi, I want to talk. speak, son. We've had enough of Kalevala's peace, my father's songs. Just empty words. Our souls long for actions. We want to be part of the new world. Many of us want to see over the seas. You know the power of Kalevala. Joukahainen is a strong man. He'd make a fine ally. He's also my friend. And he longs for fame. Give me something to convince him with. If that is your wish. What are these worth? she spoke of lands with rivers of honey- with weapons that our swords cannot pierce. They say that people in the far lands can fly like birds. Fly, like gods. she also spoke highly of you, Joukahainen. said a man of your grit ought to be the warlord of Kalevala. Me? A new age is beginning, brought by Louhi. That is clear. She has strong allies. What do you think about Sampo? -He's a good guy... Cut the crap, you know what I mean. -Sure he's a bit high strung. He's never been like me. He's got no balls. Same as his dad. Keep an eye on him. This is no time to hesitate. How far are you willing to go if things get complicated? All the way. You know that. I'm not here to play around, I'm here to get rich. Good, keep your eyes open. You look hopeless. -I'm on the edge. We all are. But you mustn't back down now. You can't mess with Kurt. -I know. You'll be all right, we're brothers. One falls, the other catches him. I have to go. Kurt is breathing down my neck. Don't let me down, sampo. Joukahainen, bowman from the village of Kalevala. Tell him to stop staring or I'll feed his eyes to your dogs. At ease, mighty warrior. -Speak, I am here. A power shall rise from behind the seas. With its help we can conquer the Cape of Pohja, Kainuu and Karelia. We've heard about you, Joukahainen... And that there are no other chiefs in Kalevala than Väinämöinen. On the coast we have converted scores of people. some by force and some by bribes... We want to see you ruling the lands of Kalevala. We'll give you a power and wisdom Väinämöinen knows nothing about. Louhi also wants to give you something to seal our alliance. This Kalevala cannot give you. We know you are aware of the skills of the daughters of Pohjola- since we've also travelled the ancient path of The Mother. But this is our time, a time for wealth and love. I shall give you this maiden, if you are a man and not a coward. Coward? No such word. The girl is as fine as can be, ready and willing. But not to be given before a man proves his worth. What do I need to do? Tell me quick! If you're man enough to rise against Väinämöinen- by crude force or cunning, you will get the girl. If you become chief we can share the riches and joys of war- and you will have more fame than the gods. Rise against Väinämöinen? I wouldn't have spoken, had the thought not crossed my mind. He's a sting in a young man's mind. Always has his say, hears not a word from others. I could try. I think I am up to the task. For I know a spell or two myself. so why not. Thor! Thor! Thor! Väinämöinen... That's my part. I came straight from the theatre. Father... I'm losing my mind. I feel like I smell of sin. This is one hell of a time bomb. Millions in money, all those countries,- and the Swedes, as always, involved... Fucking hell, Väinö. Is this what they do in this field? Go ahead, cry. Like your mother, when she's troubled. What should I do? Go to church and pray for forgiveness? That's where all the hell broke loose. The horror of ignorance. First they declare you a sinner, create the shame. Then it is cured with alcohol. You started desiring things, I've tried to curb it since you were little. But desire has great powers. What do you mean by desire? -Desires separate you from oneness. The one who desires is already "'other''. That's where it starts. socrates? We cannot escape anything. You heard Louhi's words, Kalevala is in danger. We must ask help from the higher powers of war. sampo. -Yes. Find Kullervo. Set out tonight. Kullervo? But he has left Kalevala to live alone in the woods. He is not a bad man, he just can't help his nature. In his heart he still belongs to the holy tribe of Kalevala. He will come when asked. -Which way should I go? Go east, where there are hazel forests, and deer. He hunts them. But if the woods have possessed him- you must end his days or he will end yours. What brings you here? -I want to speak with you. Any chance of a drink? I could use one. Nope. -Of course not. But some blueberry juice could cool your liver. It's on the table. What's wrong? You didn't come here just for a drink. Listen, Väinö, this is a bit hard for me. You're almost like a father to me, but I need to level with you. The situation has got so bad. -What situation? I don't know what you've been telling sampo, but he's a total wreck. This is not good at all. The way things stand- people are going to start going down if he doesn't get his act together. What about such concepts as conscience, moral and patriotism? I knew it! You are behind this. I warned you already. If I have to get nasty, I will. When people want to make a lot of money, someone always loses. And I haven't talked with sampo about money. Morals, yes. Which you also used to have, when you fought at the gates of Kalevala. Are you insane? -Don't you remember? In the business world the fast eat the slow. Even a cute little ladybug sucks the blood of aphids. Capitalism is a system inherited from insects, the strong eat the weak. You don't look like a ladybug to me. Väinö, this is the last warning. If the shit hits the fan, you'll be in for it, too. Take my word for it. -In for what? Either the air force or the submarine department. And one option is the shredder. Look at yourself. Can you see? It's that goddamned juice. -No, it's you. Don't you see what you've become? Do you remember? Well met, Joukahainen. Glad you gave a warning before the snag caught the fisherman. You're a man of many words, like water off the duck's back. But can your power stand up to this new age? Who knows. The young men are restless, tired of listening to old men's tales. New age... Do you sing the songs of the new age? Do you turn the wheel of time,- decide when an age is new, and when it becomes old? Joukahainen, your knife is too long for scaling, and you like to swing it. Trash around, young bull. Fight for your life. Fight against your ancient mother. so sinks a man into the earth he has risen against. steady old Väinämöinen, hot is my young blood. Name your price for saving my life. What can you offer when there is nothing that I want? The Mother gives me everything I need. There is nothing in this world that I desire. You can have my sister, Aino. she is pure and pretty as a flower. Young and tender, you couldn't want for a better wife. she hasn't been wedded away, she hasn't wanted to go. Her heart is still open for you. -So, your sister for your life? You have my word. Release me from the suck of earth. I accept your word, not for my sake- but for the happiness of your sister. Are you mad at me for not marrying you? I've always loved you. I wish I could explain. Really? But you wouldn't understand. Your brother and I are in deep trouble. He'd even die for you. And I'm the one to blame. set yourself free. start all over with Riitta. That is no way to live. You have to do what you want,- not what others want you to do. Or you'll fall completely apart. I have to tell you something. It may be hard to believe, but Riitta... she was assigned to me. It's hard to explain but I need to look after her. Love comes in many forms. And when it comes, there's nothing you can do about it. It's not like that. I have to take care of her and make sure- that she can deliver her child in peace. I feel like I'm asleep, although I know I'm not. What are you saying? -I'm not her man. I knew it! You came complaining to Aino- but this time it won't work. I won't let it happen. The whole family is crazy. He and his father, acting like ghosts. But they can't fool me. If you screw this up now I'll stand up against you. You can calculate what that means. What are you saying? -Things are getting pretty intense. Now when we should be playing it so cool- that even our shit will come out as icicles. Antti... Open the door. No closed doors in this house! I'm telling you as your father. You're not my father. -It's enough that you're Riitta's son. Enough for what? You're our child. -Child? In theory I am still the head of this house. so what? You can't see how lucky you are. We've given you everything, computers and all. A computer is a tool. It makes the world go round, in case you haven't noticed. What are you hiding there in your room? show me what you've got. Are you a fag? How should I put it? You have everything I never had, a home and a mother who loves you. And I am your friend. You don't know what it's like to live in hatred. What do you know about hatred, born with a gold spoon in your mouth? spoons don't make for better homes. You know about the hostility between my father and mother. You have some kind of hostility issues? It's like a shadow one can't get rid of. And that's why I'm telling you, don't get stuck on it. Don't cling to hatred. -Me? You pretend this is about me, but you're only thinking about yourself. There's more to me than money. I'm not some tycoon, like my brother Jokkeri. He's not your brother. Why do you insist- on making everyone a member of the family? My father has taught me that we are all sisters and brothers. Your father is your best part. Listen, sampo. surely you should understand what a tricky situation I'm in. I shoulder a lot of responsibility. Of course I understand. The Brotherhood, and the firm. I hope everything's fine. Everything's fine, we're just waiting for Riitta's labor to begin. I want to show you something. No thanks. Joukahainen. He is ordained to guard the holy secret. I've wanted for a long time to share something with you. I know you're interested in ancient things. You're intrigued by knowledge. Our goal isn't actually financial. We're searching for knowledge, understanding of the universe. Knowledge that can rule life itself. sampo: I present. My son. In front of you stands a so-called miracle. You know our national epic. -The Kalevala. I'm of ancient descent and my ancestors' first- arrived here to conquer new lands. And to bring a new era with them. And in their conquests, they came across it. A miracle in the village of Kalevala. -The sampo. Here in Finland there was also magical, ancient knowledge. It all culminates in this machine. Kullervo, don't shoot. It's me, Sampo. I have a message from Väinämöinen. I wish no harm. Väinämöinen says that your heart is pure and you belong to Kalevala. Maybe one can't hide from one's destiny. We all have our own destiny. But mine is quite harsh. It hasn't given me many joys. I find the forest animals more friendly than people. This is a good place for me to be- for there's a fire in me that sparks easily. We are under great threat. Louhi has joined forces with the unknown. Their swords are nearly knocking on the gates of Kalevala. We need the strength of a great warrior. And you are of the ancient gods. That I know, even though my name has been shamed. I wasn't aiming at you... You said you are friendly with the forest animals. The ancient tradition of Kalevala is that the prey will come- when the hunter calls it by the spirit. Everyone knows about sacrifice. -Sampo, what have you done... What savage have you become to kill without spells or asking? Your face is the face of a beast. Is your own heart pure? And why is Kalevala in danger? Who has spread the evil thoughts? You are in the force! In the force! Jokkeri, take Sampo out for some fresh air. sit there. Can't you see that what is going on in there is evil? All that... We are all pushed to our limits. Let's just take it easy and everything will be fine. Then we can party. -I need to get home. I can't let you go, Kurt is very nervous... Why would I run away from my own home? I'll lose my mind, if I can't go home. And we really can't afford that. sampo, sampo... Don't let me down- or Kurt will kill me. You are my brother. I don't know where to begin. It's like having a rope around my neck. A child is coming into the world, an innocent life. Like future itself. I'm about to do something that could endanger the whole future. You're a man. Do what you have to do. I don't understand any of this. If we have to live two lives- then one of them is a lie. I have to go. You look so serious. -I'm going to blow the lid on Kurt. How can I help? I'm sorry. -Why? I'm leaving all this with you. -Me? If you could pass it on. It's all in these envelopes. I can't stand the responsibility anymore. For some reason, this is how it has to go. It's up to you to do it or leave it undone. Cry not, young bride. This is a day of joy. There is no man greater in Kalevala than Väinämöinen. A great soul, a seer. Don't look at the form, look at the greatness. And stop snivelling. You traded your sister away. -I had to. I suppose it's an honor... -Should I have lost my life instead? Aino's heart was elsewhere already. Now she has given it all up. Väinämöinen used magic spells. I had to give her. But I'll show him I'm not a man to put down without revenge. Enough! Revenge is a fire that burns fiercely. Welcome to the house of feast, welcome to the bride's lair. Here awaits your other half, here awaits your bride. Here is a fine house, here is a fine maiden. Her eyes have seen no other man, her hips are untouched. We praise you, son of The First Mother. It is a great joy and honor, welcome. Mother of the bride, I thank you. My intentions are good. My son is hot-blooded, but he keeps his promises. Would you like to speak with Aino before we begin? That is why I came. Aino, I am no ordinary man. I would never take anyone against their will. I wish you no harm. I came to take you back to the sacred lands of Kalevala. Away from this oppression. Away from the craving, away from vanity. Away from the world of Louhi. -You are a great man. A man of the gods. Your thoughts are otherworldly. But what know you about a maiden's desire? Of the secrets of her heart? They are as sacred as the sacred knowledge of life. What would I do there, with no love, no heart? It has been taken from me. It will do you no good to stay here. This world leads nowhere. I want to take you to the safety of Kalevala. Away from the trampling feet of the world. There you can live free and be happy. -Happy? How could I be happy in a place where my heart feels no joy? I already gave it away, and now it is cut in half. Which side would I live on? In dreams? Not in the love of my heart. Oh, what did you do, my brother? You killed your sister. stole her life. My thoughts are pure, and my actions alike. I never wished any ill. But I can't make you see what I see myself. Farewell. Good morning, dearest. something wrong? I'm exhausted. so much has been happening to me lately... The way Sampo's been acting. -I showed him something yesterday. I confided in him. I think he'll come to his senses. We'll try to make him understand. I just feel so strange. shit. Bloody hell. Kurt, darling, what is it? Your son has leaked it all to the press. Do you understand? Your bastard is dead. Now he's a dead man. There's no way around it. But you can't just go kill someone. Really? What the hell is going on here? Daddy! -This is hell. Dad, hey. I told you I understand things a little better now. so now I'm pissed off to see you walk in just like that. You selfish pig didn't even bother to knock. Revenge can take long, even thousands of years. It's a force that drives the soul until the deed is done. What are you talking about? While your mother is giving birth! she's not my mother. I just needed her. Don't talk about your mother! You must take the children away. They need to be saved. They cannot stay, because we don't know how things will turn out. They are our people of the future. They trust you. Bring nothing with you, and leave at once. Take him, too. He will carry on your blood. But remember, they are all the beginnings of a nation- that will once have great significance in the world. Where will I take them? -Follow your heart. The enemy will kill you all if you get caught. FROM THE PAST COMES THE EVIL- BUTALSO RIGHTEOUSNESS, AND THE MEASURE OF HEROISM. Father... I'm scared. Ancient souls took upon the form of humaneness,- sacrificed themselves for a play where they needed to learn to know. Damn it, father. This isn't theatre. We're all in real danger. Kurt is a fanatic who'll do anything to have his way. I know. We are living in a time when the masks are shed. Do you know why I'm here? Could it be that thing I saw on the news? The scandal. The phone's been ringing off the hook. Why aren't you at the hospital? -Will Sampo go to jail? You are Kullervo. -Who? You brought revenge and bitterness here- but it's time to let it go. I can see through your new body. You are going to hurt the baby that will be born. That spirito-psychological shit of yours doesn't interest me. You think everything comes free? That there's no repayment for the burning hatred in your soul? It doesn't work that way. Don't tell me what to do, you old fool. No one has ever stopped me. Time has already stopped you, Kullervo. You can't move on. Right. Kullervo, indeed. Do you think you won't have to face what you carry within? Our actions pile up until time finally reaps its harvest. And your time is now, you cannot go forward. Time itself is coiling around you like a rope. Can you feel its weight, Kullervo? Like a stone in your stomach, like a rope on your neck. Unless the rope is cut off it will strangle you. What do you want, Väinämöinen? -Your life. You can't stay here. I want you to come with me to Kalevala and make a choice. Only then can you conquer anger and forgive those who have wronged you. I am free. What can I do for you? Your brother isn't here. It was I who went to the press. I came to tell you myself. Everyone else is innocent. I've kept an eye on you, and decided to put end to it all. You're wrong, Kurt. The world can't let people like you cause any more destruction. What is that? The truth you are looking for. And now you have the privilege to face it. You will get to the root of the truth. Put her in the machine. stop or you'll just make it worse. Who the fuck cares? I'm doing this for fun. You asked for it! Kurt will send you to the cold room. That's a fact. The truth is out already. You still have no idea who you're dealing with? When was the last time you felt like a man? Did something good? Defended something real and made sacrifices for others? I work for my family every fucking day. You've been toilet-trained like a poodle. When you kiss ass, gold bars fall out. When you cash in on your soul, your wife sticks by your side. But when the chips run out- will she still stick around, and say: ''We can move to a cabin- with the kids and live on pea soup? Honey, we'll be fine.'' But if you just once speak up against the board of directors- when they are selling your homeland, you'll get canned. When can you stand with a clear conscience and say:- I did the right thing, because it was right? I'm a fine man. THE END The evil is here. Welcome! Väinämöinen, this is what you have searched for thousands of years. The sampo, the miracle mill. How simple you are, Kurt Tutler. You think the truth is there. After thousands of years you still don't understand- that what you possess is just an illusion. It truly is Smith Ilmarinen's masterpiece. A miracle made by the heavenly forger. An illusion of the human mind, a continuum of endless desires. Who do you want to be the first to go? A long time ago in Kalevala they created desire to shape the mind. They had to create a form for time- and show what will happen when the shadow takes over. Kurt, you are the manifestation of that new mind. And is the bullet that will fly from this barrel just an illusion too? Let's hope so, or it'll blow your head to pieces. Väinämöinen. Here is my sister Aino- whom I have killed twice in my ignorance and hatred. Here she is. The one you've been waiting for thousands of years. Her soul wants to return with you to Kalevala, where she belongs. I will end this now. Traitor! HA TRED IS THE LASTENEMY. I did it. I fulfilled my destiny. I completed my task. Now my heart is pure. It sings with joy. Mother. Mother of mine. Carry me into the light. I who have lived in darkness. Mother. My mother. I shall rest at your feet. Kullervo is with us in Kalevala. Kullervo is dead, and soon you will be, too. That's not for you to decide, since you don't exist in reality. You're just an image of my hatred, your body is only my shadow. Your kingdom is only death. You're a dream forged by smith Ilmarinen's human mind. Now that I will return to Kalevala, you will disappear. No, you will disappear. You don't know the power of a woman. We give life, but we can also take it away. ITHAS BEEN WRITTEN: WHEN THE EVIL DIES A CHILD OF GOD WILL BE BORN. HUMANKIND WILL RISE TO A NEW CONSCIOUSNESS. Riitta? Are you my mother, the goddess Ilmatar? My son, Väinämöinen. It is time for you to start a new era- when people will gain back their consciousness. You know the way through death. You know the secret of life. You know the path to eternal regeneration. Am I the one who has to be born again? When we become one again- all the marks of otherness are shed. You will become new and pure. You will no longer belong to anyone. You will be all. THE NEW CONSCIOUSNESS MEANS PERCEIVING THE TRUTH- FROM WHERE EVOLUTION BEGINS TOWARDS PERFECTION.
