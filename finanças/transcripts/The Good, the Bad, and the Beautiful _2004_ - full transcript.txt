[strumming, Western music] [whooshing] [upbeat, strumming, Western music] [gun blasts] [upbeat, strumming, Western music] [gun blasts] [upbeat, strumming, Western music] [whooshing] [upbeat, strumming music] - You're a fine looking girl. I'd like to get your number and take you out to dinner, and you know, a couple movies, you know, get your number? Are you taken? Ah, that's too bad, I'm single-- [conversation fades] [cheerful, ambient music] [people chattering] - Hey cowboy, if I didn't know better, I'd say you were becoming a regular around here. - Well, taking a shine to your fine establishment. - Yeah, that's nice. Hey, usual? - [McCoy] Yeah, what the hell. - All right. - Annie working tonight? - [Bartender] Oh, that's what this is all about, huh? - Well, when you're only in town for a week, you can't afford to be pussyfooting around, you know? - No, you can't. - [McCoy] You've got to make your feelings known. - Yeah, you do. - So is she? - [Bartender] Is she? - Working tonight? - Yeah, I got her cleaning some bottles in the back. She'll be out. - [exhales] Good. Why don't you go ahead and hit me again there, partner. - You got it. [door clatters] - Guess who's back and asking about you. - Let me guess, tall, dark and Texan? - Mmhmm, over at the bar. - Fourth night in a row, he looks like the generous type too. - Mm, what do you have to lose? [laughs] - [laughs] Nothing at all, sister, nothing at all. [cheerful, ambient music] [people chattering] Hey, gonna hang at the bar all night or do you want a table? - Well, what I'd really like is a nice, quiet dinner date with you, Annie. - Well, I have Tuesday off. - Mm, I'm afraid I'm gonna be about a million miles away come Tuesday. - [sighs] That's too bad. - Hm. Yep. [sighs] It's uh, kinda slow in here tonight, don't you think? - Uh, yeah, damn slow. Annie, why don't you uh, take the rest of the night off if you want. - Well? - I want. [people chattering] [cheerful, ambient music] [distant siren wailing] [glasses clink] [cheerful, ambient music] - Annie, I'm usually not this forward, but I'm just gonna be heading back out west tomorrow and I didn't wanna miss the opportunity to tell you how special I think you are. - You know, that's one of the sweetest things anyone's ever said to me. - Well, it's true. - So, tell me a little about yourself. - Well, my daddy got into the oil business, back when I was a little boy, and uh, we kinda made it into a family business. And that went right fine, and I grew up a little bit and I had the idea that, well, we needed to diversify a bit. So, we got into the cattle business. Well that went right fine, 'til the cattle drank the oil. They all died. So we're back in the oil business now. We uh, went ahead and bought up a town and things like that. - Town? - Yeah, I own a town. - You own a whole town? - Yeah. - Wow. [exhales] I've always dreamed about something like that. - I'd sure like to get to know you better. We have such little time. - Well, there's always tonight. - Tonight? - Yeah, my apartment's just down the street. - Well I'd be right honored. - Shall we? - We shall. [McCoy sighs] [upbeat, rhythmic music] [distant siren wailing] [door rattles] [Annie sighs] [keys clink] - So, can I get you a drink or something? - Uh, no thank you. I'm thinking that we oughta just circle our wagons. - You are in a hurry, aren't you? [McCoy chuckles] [Annie squeals] [laughs] R.J.! [laughing] [upbeat, strumming music] [heavy breathing] [upbeat, strumming music] [people chattering] [cheerful ambient music] [phone ringing] - Hello? - So, how's it going? - He's still here. - Hm, brought him to your place, huh? Were you very naughty? [chuckles] - Yeah, I really knocked him out. - [Stacy] Is he staying over? - He is out like a light. I mean, he's really out. [hand squeaks] [thumps] I think he's dead! Oh my God. - Dead?! - Uh yeah. He's dead. - As in, dead dead? - Real dead. Oh shit, I'd better call a medic. - Oh, okay bye. [phone clicks] She fucking killed him. [phone beeps] - [whines] Why me? Why is it always me? [phone clicking] [Annie sighs] [women whispering] - Hi. [sighs] I'm sorry to put you through this during your time of grieving, but the sooner we get on with it, the sooner you'll be able to get it on. With it. - Oh, I understand, I think. - Were you uh, long-time friends? - Well, not really, but we were close. - I see. Uh, well Mr. McCoy's will was rather specific about how his estate would be settled. - Well, to be honest with you, I'm kinda surprised I'm even here. - It reads uh, and I quote, in as much as a fellow never knows who's gonna turn yellow and run when the going gets tough, and I can't rightly know who will stand by me in the very end, I hereby bequeath my entire estate to whomever is next to me at the time of my death. That's you. - Are you saying that Annie inherited all of Mr. McCoy's estate? - Well, that would be the case. - I'm rich, [laughs] I'm rich! - [Lawyer] Not quite that easy. - [Together] Oh? - From what we can determine, Mr. McCoy's holdings consisted mainly of the Devil's Ring Casino in Nevada. - Casino? - [Lawyer] Yes, that and the Lost Diamond Mine. - Diamond mine? - Well that's what it's called. Actually, the Lost Diamond Mine is a silver mine. - Who cares, silver, gold, I'm not picky. - Well here are the deeds to the Devil's Ring Casino and the Lost Diamond Mine, and in the packet is some money, whatever was in his pockets at his time of passing. - Thank you so much. - Please be advised that the Lost Diamond Mine is actually lost, no one's been able to find it in 100 years of searching and it's said to be haunted. There's a map in there, but the map is 150 years old. So undoubtedly, it's worthless. - Well, check and double check. - At least you own a casino. [laughs] - You wanna go to Nevada? - [Stacy] Thought you'd never ask, come on! [laughs] [lawyer sighs] [sniffs] [upbeat, twangy music] - [Annie] Imagine, being able to walk through the doors of your very own casino, snap your fingers and everybody jumps to serve you. - [Stacy] Mm, free shrimp cocktails. [laughs] - [Annie] My own personal slot machines. - [Stacy] Cheap hookers. [laughs] - [Annie] Hot, desperate gigolos. [Stacy laughs] There's one problem, though. I think that we're lost. - [Stacy] No sweat, just pull over and ask for directions. - Oh, check this guy out. [twangy banjo music] Hey Gomer! Which way to Devil's Ring Casino? [upbeat, twangy music] Don't strain yourself. [upbeat, twangy music] [quiet, mysterious music] [gravel crunching] [quiet, mysterious music] [birds chirping] [quiet, mysterious music] [Annie yawns] - Well, I wonder how much further it is to Devil's Ring. - [sighs] I don't know, but my ass is killing me. - This looks like a lovely place to die. [chuckles] - You're kidding me. Even the ghosts have pulled up stake and moved on. - Wow. Uh, Annie, look. [snare drum rim shot] - Oh dear. - Oh dear, oh dear. - [sighs] Why me? Why is it always me? - [Wyatt] Having car trouble? - Oh, [laughs] no. We were just looking around. - Well this ain't no place for women to be poking around here. There's dangers here y'all don't want no part of. - Danger? - Yeah, dangers, like rattlesnakes and Chihuahuas and orangutans, big as your hand. - Bigger. Really, this ain't no place for ladies. - [laughs] Well, thanks for the warning, guys, but Annie here, she owns this whole town and everything in it. So uh, you can just go ahead. - [spits] [laughing] You hear that? Owns Devil's Ring, you hear that, Wyatt? - Lock, stock and barrel. - You don't say? - I do say, inherited it from R.J. McCoy. - Old R.J., is he uh. - Get the picture? - Well, this ain't no place to be spending the night, not with all them spooks flying around, shrieking, making all kinds of crazy noises. - Noises. - So why don't you two little ladies come up to the big house and visit with the boss? Him and and R.J., they were like that. - [laughs] And which one was R.J.? - Well R.J. was uh, damn. [Annie laughs] Why don't you two funny ladies come up to the big house anyways? I'm sure the boss would like to meet you. - Oh, [sighs] I guess I'll check it out. - Yeah, you know what, I'll put the luggage in there and I'll have a bed waiting for you when you get back, okay? - All right, you can tell me what horror awaits me. - Yeah. [laughs] - All right, let's go. [Stacy sighs] [horse whinnies] [strumming music] So were you and R.J. close? - [Wyatt] Mm. [laughs] - Well, I guess you could say old R.J. and J.R. Were opposites, yeah, but friendly opposites. I was the yin to his yang, you know, the salt to his pepper, the bacon to his eggs, the Roy to his Trigger, the Starsky to his Hutch, the Moby to his Dick. - Mm. - That's why I really couldn't understand that when he died, he would leave everything to, well, forgive me for saying, a complete stranger. - Well I think that he was afraid of who was gonna cut and run when the going got tough. - Well that makes sense, doesn't it? Now you may not know this but, old R.J. and I had an agreement that if one of us died, well the other could buy their property. What do you think of that? - I think it's too bad that he's not here to ask. - [chuckles] Well it's, that's true, isn't it? Now tell me, have you heard uh, something about uh, little place called the Lost Diamond Mine? - Yes, we're gonna start looking for it tomorrow. - [chuckles] You're gonna look for it? [laughs] She gonna look for it. [laughing] Now, I don't know if you're aware of the fact that for the last 100 years, trained professionals, men, have tried to find that mine, men, with dredges and machinery and know-how and knowledge and the knack to read the land. Mineralogists, genealogists, OBGYN's, no one could find that mine in 100 years. Now, what makes you think, you, little Miss Get 'Em, gonna sashay on into this territory and walk in there and find the Lost Diamond Mine? [laughing] - We have a map. [wolf howling] - Good answer. Hm. Well, you know what? Why don't we just do a neighborly thing here, I'm gonna give you a very generous amount of money, yes dear, just a moment, I'm going to give you a generous amount of money for that worthless piece of property. Now, what do you say to that, huh? - I have to wonder why you'd be so kind as to do that. - Well, it's real simple, you know, I mean uh, [clears throat] you know, our properties, they sort of butt up to each other, yeah, and uh, well I had always figured I would bulldoze that ugly, old, rundown ghost town anyway and let my cattle sort of spread out a little bit. You know, nobody likes a narrow cattle, thin, scrawny, limp cattle. They like strong cattle, you know, it's a lot easier to catch 'em and brand 'em, you know. - Well, I'm afraid that I can't fully entertain your offer until I've had time to investigate exactly what it is that I've inherited. - Uh, [clears throat] That's fine, thank you. [sighs] Well, you haven't even heard my offer yet. - I'm sure I will, in a few days. - Well, suit yourself. [clears throat] Oh uh, by the way, uh, if you've heard, there is a uh, terrible curse on that area up there, called the Devil's Ring. That whole area, there's some sort of a strange, ghostly spirit to that area, and it's, it's filled with dark, demon-y, little biting, squiggly little things with gnawing teeth that'll come and get inside your underwear and gnaw on your privates. - Oh, thanks for the warning. - Well, you're welcome. It's what neighbors do, huh? Well you'll uh, have a good night, and I hope to see you real soon. [Annie sighs] Well girls, if you'll excuse me, I think uh, we're gonna have to go outside, do a little man talk, huh boys? Why don't you uh, make yourselves comfortable? Boys. [match snaps] [J.R. sighs] - you want us to tar and feather her? - Tar and feather. No, you crazy, tar is up to $52 a barrel. No, we gotta come up with something craftier now. - Hm. - Gotta get a hold of that map to the Lost Diamond Mine. - We can scare 'em off. That always works. - Yeah, you're both real scary. Well whatever we do, that girl's gotta sell that property in two days. You got me? - Yeah. - How many days? - Two days. - How many? - Two? - Good. [slaps arm] - What's up? - Not what's up, but uh, what's going down, yonder. [Wyatt chuckles] [gentle, quiet music] [men clatter] [gentle, quiet music] [owl hooting] [insects singing] [wolf howling] [insects singing] - Oh, do you think everything about this place being haunted is true? - No, don't be silly. There's no such thing as ghosts. [upbeat, twangy music] Gomer, shut up! [women sigh] See, I told you, nothing to worry about. - Yeah. [women sigh] [insects singing] [playful, suspenseful music] [men yelling] - [Wyatt] Hey it's me, it's me, it's Wyatt. Here. Scare ya? - You scared the hell outta me! [mutters] - [Wyatt] Well, let's hope that it works on the girls. Where's my hat? [men yelling] [Wyatt clattering] - [Ringo] Sheesh, you all right? - [Wyatt] All right, come on, let's go. They're just a couple of girls. - Woo! - Sheesh. [men mimicking ghosts] [owl hooting] [men mimicking ghosts] - Annie. Annie, wake up! - What? - Listen. [playful music] [men mimicking ghosts] What kind of animal makes that noise? - Huh? A dead animal. [gasps] Look! Oh my God! - [Ringo] Wyatt, where you going? Yo, hey Wyatt, this way. [men mimicking ghosts] - [shuddering] Are they, are they ghosts? - Well it ain't a clan rally. [playful, spooky music] [men laugh] [men mimicking ghosts] [playful, spooky music] [gentle, Western music] [hooves pattering] - Ha! Ha ha! [gentle, Western music] [men mimicking ghosts] Whoa, ha. [upbeat, Western music] [men mutter] - [Ringo] Look at that! [men screaming] [gun blasts] [men screaming] [gun blasts] [men screaming] [gun blasts] [upbeat, Western music] [hooves pattering] [upbeat, Western music] - What the hell just happened? - I don't know. I, I think the fireworks are over for tonight. - [labored breathing] Good. [sighs] I'm beat. - Me too. [twangy, strumming music] - Gomer, shut up! [sighs] Okay, goodnight, Stace. - Goodnight, Annie. - [Together] Goodnight, R.J. - Okay. [sighs] [insects singing] [twangy, strumming music] - Oh. [laughs] [Ringo yelling] - God! Oh, this is so gay, Wyatt. [labored breathing] - Where'd you get the tattoo, Ringo, and who the hell's Ryan? [Ringo yelling] - Just get the goddamn bullet out and nevermind you about Ryan, okay? - I missed it. - Oh! - It seems to be going in deeper. [Ringo grunting] [swishing broom] - Ew. - [sighs] What a mess. Maybe I should just sell this place to J.R. Masterson. [sighs] I mean, I don't see what value could possibly be in it for me. [sighs] - I don't know, but someone who wants something as bad as he does, that makes me suspicious. - I know, I mean, he was practically drooling over it. - Yeah. Who was that woman last night? - I don't know, but she even scared the spooks. - Actually, I thought she was hot looking. [women laugh] - Definitely agreed. - [clears throat] Morning ladies. - Oh, [sighs] Mr. Masterson, you sure are light on your feet. Didn't hear you coming. - [chuckles] Yeah, I'm sorry, next time I'll be sure and holler real loud. - What brings you our way? - Well, I just wanted to make sure you both, [sighs] doing fine, you know, make sure that you didn't have any problems at night. - Well, we did have a bit of a ruckus last night, but [sighs] turned out okay in the end. - Ah, well, I heard about that. You know, it's a long time since I've been up here. Place sure has changed a lot since I've been here though. [laughs] Now it's just a big, old dump. Like a big, old tinder box just waiting to ignite, isn't it? - Yeah, a tinder box, but a tinder box with potential. - Yeah, lots of potential. - Oh, potential. Well, you two little ladies gonna clean this whole place all by yourself? [laughs] - This corner of it, yeah. - Well good, real good. - Well, if you don't mind, we've got some work to do. - Oh, oh, that's fine, that's fine. Oh uh, just wanted to remind you of that offer I made you, it still stands. Might save you a whole lotta trouble and time. - [chuckles] Yeah, don't worry, we'll keep your offer in mind. - Well, I never worry, ladies. Good day to you. [twangy, strumming music] [pattering hooves] Wyatt, Ringo, you two nitwits think you got what it takes to get this job done? - Ready and willing, boss. - All right. Only this time, boys, I think we're gonna try a little different approach. - Different approach? - Yeah, yeah, here's what you're gonna do, you're gonna start by befriending those young girls. That's right, get real cozy like, help 'em with their chores and then when they least suspect it, I want you to steal that map and you bring it back to me, you hear? - Yeah, I get it, it's like uh, reverse paralysis. - Just do it, will ya? - Yes sir, you got it, J.R. - Oh and boys, I want you to wait a full half an hour before you ride on in there, you hear me? Don't screw up. See you boys. [pattering hooves] [strumming music] - Two Bit says this map is what everyone's so excited about. - Well it sure isn't the view. [laughs] - Well, I'm going to put this someplace they'll never sniff it out. [laughs] - Good luck hiding it there. [pattering hooves] [horse whinnies] - Well, well, well, look what the gopher dragged in. [pattering hooves] - Morning, ladies. - What's shaking, handsome? - Thought you might need some help lifting stuff. - Well, [sighs] I guess so. [claps rail] This rail here could use some work. You boys got tools? - Yeah, you got some tools over there in that blacksmith shop over there. - Great, let's go find 'em. - They're right over yonder. - Okay Slick-- - My name's Ringo, ma'am. - Come on, follow me. [twangy, strumming music] [Annie sighs] - Well, this place looks like it's being held together with cobwebs, but it's home for now. - Never dared venture inside here before. - Well, I found a room upstairs, I think if I fix it up, Stacy and I can bunk down there tonight. - You two girls sleep together? - [slaps chest] It's not like that, you pervert. Not yet anyway. You coming? - You bet. - Back yonder is the blacksmith shop, all the blacks and the smiths used to get together and pound nails. - Oh Jesus. - No, Jesus wasn't into pounding nails, that was the Romans. - Hey, look over here. - Yeah, what do you got over there? - Hm, see something you like, cowboy? - Uh, sorry ma'am, I, I didn't mean to be staring. - Yeah? How about now? - Oh now, now I meant to be staring, oh yeah, and I'm staring. - You know, [sighs] why don't you show me how they pound the nails out West. - Sure thing. First you're gonna need this hammer over-- - No, not those kind. Like this. [upbeat, sexy music] [door clatters] - Woo! [crow cawing] This place sure does give me the creeps! - Well, at least it's indoors. I did not wanna spend another night outside. - You know what? I think this used to be the room where the hookers used to hang out, back in the day. [book thumps] - Ew, um, just how old is this place? - Goes back to the late 1800's. It was just a small wagon stop at the edge of town where people would rest up before moving on to California. - A real boom town, huh? - Not exactly, but when some folk discovered silver in the mines, this place did heat up a might. - So that's where the Lost Diamond Mine comes in. - Well, that's more of a legend really. Biggest thing about that is the idea that a local outlaw named Calamity Kate hid her stash of loot out there in them mines. - Calamity Kate? - They say she was one tough lady. They say she robbed dozens of stagecoaches, banks and trains. They say her ghost still haunts this place, protecting her treasure in the Lost Diamond Mine. - All this talk of ghosts and spooks, there's no such thing. - I wouldn't be so sure about that. - So, is that why J.R. Masterson wants this place so badly? - I reckon he'd love to bulldoze this whole place if he thought he could discover the lost mine shaft. - Isn't he afraid of the ghosts? - He don't believe in that sort of thing, but I do. - Poor, poor Ringo. Don't worry, I'll protect you. - Yeah, but who's gonna protect you? - [sighs] Why don't we uh, check out that couch and make sure it's safe to sleep on? - Couldn't hurt. - [laughs] That's what you think. [Ringo shudders] [groans] - Careful. Real careful. - Oh. - What are you looking at? Hey-- - I've never seen one of these before, close up. - Hey, that's cold steel. - Oh, [giggles] I like it. - Careful with that. It's a man's weapon. It's long and hard. - Yeah? I'll show you a woman's weapon. [buttons patter] [Ringo whimpers] [cheerful, strumming music] [pattering hooves] [cheerful, strumming music] - Thought I gave you guys fair warning last night. Maybe you don't hear so good. - Um, who are you? - I'll ask the questions. - That's the, the girl who shot me last night. - What's going on here? - You boys have got to the count of 10, you're outta here. - Don't bother counting. [Ringo whimpering] [upbeat, strumming music] - You ladies are too trusting. Those boys ain't the brightest prairie dogs in the hole, but they sure know how to follow orders. [exhales] You got that map? - Yes. - Good. Now, let's get out of the middle of the road, huh? [pattering hooves] [twangy, strumming music] [pattering footsteps] This is the old VIP room. Guests of a wealthy manner were finely entertained here. [laughs] Parties went on for days and days and days and days. 'Til the money or the booze ran out, that is. [chuckles] - Well, sounds like you know this place well. - I did. Once. - Well who are you? - Well that doesn't really matter now, does it? - [laughs] Yeah, it does. I mean, you just don't know who you can trust. - Well, I got me some land over the hill there, but that J.R. Masterson bought up every speck of land in this place except mine. I hate that bastard. [gun clicking] [exhales] And those damn polecats that work for him. We agree to disagree. - For a minute there, I thought you might be a ghost. - Ghost? [mimics a ghost] I mean, [laughing] really girls, would a ghost kiss like this? [twinkling music] [gentle, quiet music] Woo! [horse whinnies] [J.R. exhales] - Now let me get this straight, you say that, [clears throat] yesterday she shot you in the ass. - No no no, that was me, boss. - That was him. - Oh, she shot you in the ass and then today, come back again and she run both of you off. - She's incredibly fast, boss, I mean, she's so fast. [mimics shooting] [J.R. laughs] - Let me see if I can assess what's going on here now, evidently, for the last two days, these two little girls have been kicking your two big, tough asses all around the place. Am I right or not? Yeah well, I guess that calls for more drastic measures. - You mean? - What do you mean, "You mean," you don't even know what I mean. You don't know what I was gonna say when I said, "I mean," you know what I mean? You know? - All right, boss. - All right? No, what I mean is a little tit for tat. - Tit for what? - Tit for tat! Map for muff. One of you is gonna go in there and you are gonna kidnap one of those girls and hold her for the map. - Oh. - Which one? - I don't give a rusty fart which one. Just go in and do something right for once in your miserable lives, all right? 'Cause I am tired of being nice, I am tired of being nice. [shudders] Oh, I wanna be evil. I wanna be evil. [shudders] Just do it. [twangy, strumming music] [gun clicks] [twangy, strumming music] [shuffling footsteps] [Wyatt exhales] [shuffling footsteps] - Hate to do this, but, [gun clicks] hands up. - What? - You are now my hostage. - [sighs] You are so dead. - We'll just have to see about that. Let's go, move it, move it. [rustling hay] [cows mooing] [clanking metal] [rooster crows] - Hold it right there, sweetheart. - What do you want? - Uh, taking you prisoner. - [sighs] So what's the plan? You gonna kidnap me and ransom me for the map? - Yeah, that's it. - Aren't you forgetting something? - Like what? - Like my new friend who's got a pistol pointed at your head. - Ha, that's funny. [pistol clicks] - Take his gun, Annie. Hold him up here. I think we got some trouble outside. - This isn't loaded. - Yeah, I know, I didn't want anyone to get hurt. - You know? [slaps arm] Maybe you're not such a bad guy after all. You want the map? Why don't you strip search me for it? [Annie chuckles] - Got any front pockets? - Don't you think I'd hide it somewhere much more creative? [clattering items] Wyatt, you bonehead. Let's take a roll in the hay. [upbeat, sexy music] [heavy breathing] [Annie laughs] [heavy breathing] [upbeat, sexy music] [birds chirping] [twangy, strumming music] - Come on over. [pattering footsteps] [birds chirping] - Well I've about had it with you bitches. Now, I want you to hand me over that map right now, otherwise little Miss Goody Two-Shoes here is gonna be turned into prairie dust. - Tough talk, Masterson. Let's see if you can back it up. Annie, bring him out! [Wyatt clattering] - Ow! Ow, ow. Ow. - [sighs] Wyatt, you are dumber than paint, you know that? - Yes sir, I am. - 'Cause you are so dumb, you think that MCI is a rapper. - Dumb I am sir, yes. - You're so dumb, you think that Taco Bell is a Mexican phone company. - It's not? - You're so dumb, if you saw a sign that said, "Wet floor," you'd do it. All right, what do you want? - Exchange, send Stacy over here, we'll send back your trained monkey. - Ha, I always get the short end of the deal, don't I? All right, you win. [sighs] Go ahead, send her over. [shuffling footsteps] All right, no bring Wyatt over. - Can I have my gun back? [thumps hat] Oh, my hat. Ow! [clattering footsteps] Nice meeting ya! [pattering footsteps] [birds chirping] [whistling, Western music] - Well now, seems to me there ought to be some way we can settle this thing. - The only way I know how. [upbeat, Western music] - Whoa, [laughs] just you and me then, huh? [upbeat, Western music] - On the count of three. [upbeat, Western music] One, two-- [horse whinnies] [gun blasting] [J.R. laughing] [gun blasting] - Sorry about that, but I never was much good at playing fair. [upbeat, dramatic music] - Three. [gun clicks] - Wait a minute, I just shot you, you, [playful, dramatic music] good Lord, good Lord, you, you must be the ghost of Calamity Kate! [horse whinnies] [playful, dramatic music] All right, I'll get you! If not now, I'll get you at the sequel! [stammering] What are you waiting for? - [Wyatt] Oh my God, it really is the ghost! [shudders] [Ringo shuddering] [playful, dramatic music] [women breath a sigh of relief] [Kate sighs] - That was unreal, you scared 'em silly! - I mean, he really thought that he shot a ghost. What did you use, a bullet proof bra? - What's that? - You know, that thing that keeps you from getting shot? - [chuckles] I'm afraid not. - You really are the ghost of uh-- - Calamity Kate! - Yeah! - Well, my friends call me Katherine. - Oh my gosh! [laughs] - Wow! [laughs] - You still got that map? - Yeah um, what do you want me to do with it? - Well, you plan on looking for my treasure? - No, not if you don't want us to. - Good, well if I were you, I'd burn that map and head on home. - Consider it burned. - Well, I gotta go. See y'all later. Oh, by the way, thanks for the hot, steamy sex. It was to die for. [laughs] - You're welcome. [quiet, Western music] [hooves pattering] - Um, Annie? - Mmhmm? - Let's go home now, okay? - [laughs] Good idea. [Stacy laughs] [engine humming] [playful, twangy music] [horn honks] [shuffling footsteps] [upbeat, strumming music] [cheerful, upbeat music]
