is cursed well get the out of here it's true a long time ago some ugly-ass kid named jason drowned in this camp his mom worked here she blamed the counselors but nobody believed her so she went nuts ended up killing a bunch of people because of it sounds like they deserved it yeah well she didn't get everyone this one girl thought back cut that bitch's head clean off that's not even the best part i don't want to know the best part of course you do a lot of people around here say jason came back the night his mom died he murdered three times as many people as she did but they killed him too they say his body is still buried in this camp somewhere which is why nobody's coming in here and why we're safe we just need to wait it out until nightfall and slip out through the cracks rest up sundown's in two hours why don't yes me i was just there serena is that you you're around isn't funny yes so come on please god damn it's like somebody just walked on my grave i still can't figure out why they'd go this way to begin with i wouldn't know if they do decide to split up this would be the place to do it you know i probably should go and try and find bear soon yeah i'm just curious why
