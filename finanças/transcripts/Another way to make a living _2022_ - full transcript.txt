He'll be right there. How's it going? Moritz! Come here, buddy. Let me look at you. You look great! Rita can you get your brother and me something to drink? Come sit down. I'm proud of you for keeping quiet. You can count on me Milan, you know that. Yes, yes, I know. There's so many rats out there nowadays I have to be careful. Eddy told me you were here with a buddy from prison. Just for a quick beer. Hey relax, everything's fine. I'm glad if you meet new people. Do you trust him? Yes. Good. Maybe you can introduce us sometime? Listen, I had you come here, because I need Eddy, Mike and you to do me a favor. Shoot. There's a few guys on my case, and I need to take care of that soon as possible. You'll do this in the daytime. Money only from the registers. Moritz, I wouldn't ask this of you if it weren't important. There's no other way. Ok I knew I could count on you. How's Anna? I haven't seen her in a long time. Good. Good. Not much longer, and we'll really have something to say here, Moritz. You know he's not going to let you go. We'll make it, ok? Maybe Eric can help us. Instead of just running away you're pulling others into this? Do you think it's that easy? Why do you think we are in this fucking situation? Fuck. And how is Eric supposed to help you? I'll explain later. Which brings us to the third and final rule. If you fall you get back up again and fight. Never stay down never. Your future is in your own hands. You're almost half an hour late. Yes I'm onto something, and it got a little late yesterday. New bakery and gym you're writing the articles. Hey, can you do that yourself, please? That is your job! We're a local paper and not "Die Zeit" or some other fancy paper. Don't even start that discussion! How long have we been friends now? So now what? I'll finish the article about the bakery tonight. Eric, it's not that. What is it then? I'm sentenced to 12 years for murder. Multiple robberies drug possession insurance fraud. I would have told you eventually. That's not the point. You know that I always wanted to write something about organized crime and... you just don't understand that. Why? Because the stupid editor-in-chief of the awful local paper knows nothing about good journalism? You know I didn't mean it like that. I just don't understand what you have against it. It's crazy to walk into a jail on an impulse to write an article on gang crime without any preparation whatsoever. I will not print this for your own protection. I want to publish this as a book. Even if that's your dream it doesn't work that way. How long has this been going on? A few months? Can't you see how rushed this is? Everybody always wants everything immediately, whatever the cost. How do you know that he told you the truth in jail and doesn't just want to grab the money? I interviewed several different men in jail who were all connected to organized crime in some way. Moritz was the most interesting so untypically quiet and reserved. We had made the deal that I would pick him up after his release. He was only in jail for a few months, because they had evidence of blackmail. And even though we had met several times I don't think he was sure he could trust me until this moment. He asked me to drive him to a bar where he wanted to meet his buddies and that we would discuss everything else later. But Moritz didn't want to tell me, who he was meeting there and why that was so urgent. Wait here. I couldn't stand to wait, I needed to know who he was meeting. Can I get you something? No, I don't think so, thanks. On that day I met Eddy and Mike. Milan will be happy that you're back. He can use any help he can get at the moment. He wants to expand the business and is acting like the big clan boss. If you ask me it would be best if everything stays as it is. You have to admit that is good! What you're doing is dangerous do you get that? Did they notice that you were recording? Or the bartender? So maybe they did after all? The bottle is not on the house by the way. Looks like they want something from you. Thanks. Hey be careful. Eric this is Eddy and Mike. Pleasure. So, are you just as relieved as our hero over here? Didn't you learn anything at college? You have the responsibility to protect your sources. In the recording you can explicitly hear that he asked you to wait in the car. And you just ignored it. I hope for your sake that Moritz has the same enthusiasm for this thing as you do. I hope Milan leaves you alone for a while now. Is something wrong? Hello!? Did you notice a guy lately when you were hanging out at the bar? Approximately this tall with eyes like this. Okay!? No, why? Strange guy. Do you trust him? Not a bit. And Milan? He Just sees another guy he can chase around But I don't know… The food is so spicy, you can't even tell that it's already cold. One of your new friends? You don't have to worry. Moritz is not someone you need to be afraid of. I was actually thinking about the others. What if they find out about it? They won't. What makes you so sure? I just know. After I had met Moritz at the bar a few times he suddenly stopped calling for several days. I thought for a moment that he had told Eddy and Mike something about it. So I drove to his place after work, to see if everything was really ok. I'm gonna go upstairs now, ok? Mh mh. You're so absent-minded today. I'm just thinking. About? What if we left everything behind us? A few days before we had a fight because he didn't tell me about Milan's, his bosses, plans. You want to know what a friend told me? It doesn't work that way. Hello, are you listening to me? That robbery yesterday, was you, right? No idea what you're talking about. The next time you do something like this, I need to know about it! Why? Because people want to know what goes through someone's head before that. I can tell you right now. You're about to shit in your pants! That's not enough. I don't have time for this right now. When he saw me, he lost his nerves immediately. I have no idea whether he was scared, or if it was because of his sister, who was visiting him. It was she who told me that the two of them had been working for Milan for several years now. If I don't open the door… What are you doing here? We wanted to meet four hours ago… You can't just show up here, ok? - I... - What if Eddy had been here, huh? One look in your fucking notebook and we're fucked! Calm down! Everything ok? We know each other already. I knew her from the bar, but I didn't know that she was his sister. Ok, I need to get going. You're gonna drive my sister home, right? Half-sister. Of course. Who was that. An old buddy. Did something happen? No, he's just driving Rita home. Ok. Is everything alright? Yes, why? You're so quiet. I'm often quiet. You really wouldn't have had to drive me. Don't worry about it. Would you like to come in for a drink? Okay! I know, it's a little messy. What would you like to drink? You don't seem like the type of guy that would hang out with my brother. I'm sure you have a good job. I know, I shouldn't have done that. So she texts you regularly? Are you seeing her? I thought I would get to Moritz easier through her and would maybe find something out that he didn't tell me yet. It's nice here. I like to go here when I find the time. How far are you? What do you mean? The book. It's ok Moritz told me about it. Does anyone else know? I don't know maybe his girlfriend, no idea. Are you sure everything's ok? I'm just worried about him. They won't notice anything. There are no names or anything in the book. By the time I have a publisher he'll be long gone. I'm sure he'll help you, too. That's not the point. They're demanding more and more of him. What do you mean? You should break it off with him, before you get too involved in this yourself. I can't do that. I really can't do that. And why not? A lot depends on this book. Your brother is counting on it. I can't believe you told her what you're doing. Moritz would have told her anyway! I just hope he didn't tell his girlfriend Anna anything yet. You do know how unprofessional that will look if you really publish this book. Does Moritz know? No. It's better if it stays that way. Do you have to leave again? What do you think? And why don't you stay here for a while? You know that. And when are you coming back? You're annoying! You're a jerk Eddy, do you know that? Sure. Is Rita here? Ok I'll try again later. "THE LOCAL" Ok guys, do you have everything? Can't you see that? Or isn't it enough? Yes, yes, of course. Where's Moritz? Everything alright? Listen the handover is tomorrow. We have everything we need. Don't let anything go wrong! You should probably really take someone with you. What about the guy that Moritz brought along the other day? Oh, I don't know. Moritz trusts him. And now? A construction site for many years now. The perfect money laundering site along with the bar. How many of them are there? Enough. Not all of them belong to Milan though, he couldn't afford that even if he likes to pretend he can. He actually doesn't have that much to say. That's why he is trying with all his might to climb the ladder. And he's succeeding. Why did you let yourself get pulled into this? Fast money. I just sort of slipped into it somehow. Milan is sick of keeping his head above water with little jobs. He wants to reposition himself completely. Away from the Marihuana sales and blackmailing. Milan wants to rule the clubs. So that's why they're meeting with Viktor to make a deal. Forty-thousand in cash. Deal. Viktor produces his pills abroad sells them to Milan and in turn, Milan keeps out of the cocaine business and everything else. You can arrange the rest with my contact. But the money is not enough. Milan has a problem that no one is allowed to find out about. And not one cent less, is that clear? Of course not. That's where Mike, Eddy, and Moritz come in. The men that he trusts. Moritz I wouldn't ask this of you if it weren't really important. They're only a few people, and Milan can't afford to lose another one to the police. We can't forget, Milan is just playing the big drug boss. So they can't just go and rob a jewellery store or a bank. The money has to come from somewhere else. What? We're going in there? Yes, man. Milan was talking about some kind of place but not this one! If they find out that … Calm down! Nobody's gonna find out. Just don't make any mistakes. Does everyone know what they have to do? Ok, then let's go! Milan wants to get the money from the competition. But since they're also working with Viktor, that can never come out. On the floor now! Sit down! Sit down, asshole! Get up! Move! Now! Fill it up! What are you waiting for? Yea chill, man! Put the phone down! I said put the phone down! Got it? I would've shot every single fucker in there if necessary! But he has no other alternative. You're playing with fire! Yes, but this could be a huge story. That may be true, but you're stumbling head over heels into this thing that you don't even fully understand! If Milan is as power hungry as you say… Yes, but he's only playing the big drug boss. You don't know which lines he would cross to get there. You're just saying this, because you can't stand to work alone at a local paper. Come on, why don't you believe that everything will be good in the end? We're going around in circles! Yes, you're avoiding my question. You'd rather focus on how it is to be a successful author than put your energy into the actual work! I thought you believed in me. I do but please think about your way of working. You seriously offered me to write an article without even… Do you know how hard it is to write an article about this bakery? This woman just didn't have anything interesting to tell me. And her oh so special bakery looked like any other bakery. Sorry that I can't offer you a Pulitzer article. Come on, that's not the point and you know it. What is the point then? Tell me! Come on, spit it out! I just don't want to end up dissatisfied in the editorial office like you. So that's what you think? Just because you're dissatisfied, I have to be, too? I was so happy when they gave me the job. I love running a little local paper at my age. You came to me when you didn't make it into the big publishing houses. So don't let it out on me, if your life didn't turn out the way you imagined it. Didn't you hear about it? There was an armed robbery just around the corner. And the robbers? Gone! But there's a woman who claims to have talked to one of them. Sorry I have to go. You know, Eddy and Mike are horrible people, but … I've been through so much with them. That kind of creates a bond, you know? You should break it off with him, before you get too involved in this yourself. You should break it off with him, before you get too involved in this yourself. You should break it off with him, before you get too involved in this yourself. You should break it off with him, before you get too involved in this yourself. Hey. Hey. Listen, I... It's ok. I keep listening to one of the recordings over and over again… You should break it off with him, before you get too involved in this yourself. Maybe she knows something doesn't that concern you? What do you mean? That's one of the last recordings from when is it? Two weeks. You know, Eddy and Mike are horrible people, but … I've been through so much with them. That kind of creates a bond, you know? Don't you think he might have caved in and that's how she wanted to tell you? No, I don't think so. Does she know you're recording your conversations? No. What if she finds out? Here. I know how you feel about the whole thing, but I really care about your opinion. If you could look at the first chapters maybe... You know I've always stood by you. I'm just asking you to look it over, and here on the last pages there are more connections... Based mostly on one source, an errand boy. But I told you that Milan and Co think that Moritz and I know each other from prison and that they're planning this deal. Moritz just called me. Milan wants me to be a part of it. You said yourself that one source wouldn't be enough. Don't push this on me now! This is the only possibility to get deeper insights. You're putting yourself, Rita Moritz, his girlfriend and maybe even me in danger do you understand that? All I ever wanted to do was to write an exciting article. This is the jackpot. I'll see to it that nothing happens to anybody. I promise. But the way you're doing it is careless! You're seeing an informant's sister! Who also happens to know about everything. If you keep acting so carelessly everything's gonna come out! Celine, they're not gonna… Stop saying you have everything under control! I'm gonna go there, Celine! If you do that, you can pack your stuff and get out of here. Celine... I'm sorry! Listen Milan wants you to come along. If we go in there, there's no turning back. But that's good! Do you understand what that means for you? I didn't conduct interviews in jails for months only to back out now. Let's go in there, this is the best thing that could've happened. And you don't think that maybe someone will ask you how you got to your sources? If you end up in jail that won't help us at all! Then I'll just write about some past deal that an anonymous source told me about. Alright then. Well my friend, everything ok? Of course why wouldn't it be? You tell me. Very good, you brought him along. Great to have you with us. You will be a big help to us. That guy gave you the envelope with the drugs, right? Of course. And where is the money for the fucking pills? Milan I wanted to give you the money next week. Next week? Because, mm, I have some problems at home my son is sick. Oh, I'm sorry. Do you wanna fuck with me, or what? One more time and you're dead, you bastard! Call me when you're done. Does that fucker have to come along? You will survive. If he fucks up, I'm gonna beat him up. "THE LOCAL" What's wrong? Never seen a gun before? Keep calm, it's not the first time. Is this always how it goes? That's just show. Come on! I'm glad you found your way here. Can we please get down to business right away. Where are your manners? I can't believe Viktor is doing business with you. You're just a handful of crooks. Hey Boss that guy over there looks familiar. Who? That one? No The one next to him. From prison maybe? That's what I wanted to show you before. You were right from the beginning. But you should still think about what your buddy Moritz has to do with it. Because I don't believe that he didn't know anything about it. Do you happen to know where he is? Is he maybe even here? Who wants to know that? He really fucked up big time! I really don't know what you're talking about. What is that? Read. Fuck... Did Moritz know about this? I asked you if he knew! I think so. Fuck! Nothing could go fast enough for you! You're still talking to me, is that clear? I'm sure we can talk to Viktor. And the problem with that little editor-in-chief… is solved. Did anybody see you? Nobody. Why don't you drive away for a few days. No idea where. Just let me fix this shit first. This is not gonna go well. Are you hungry? I have to go. Coffee? I really can't. You show up in the middle of the night and now you just have to go without giving me a reason? What happened last night? Will we see each other later? Ok… What's that got to do with giving up? This is complete madness! We can't finish this thing we're about to get busted. Moritz, the first draft is almost finished That won't help us if we have bullets in our heads! Can I get you anything? He's waiting in the back. I'll bring you to him. You really fucked up! One of your guys totally flipped out! Are you telling me that I don't know how to do my job? Are you saying I don't have my people under control? What are you? A fucking consultant manager!? You know, I've been asking myself where did you get the money from? This nice young man came and asked me "Viktor do you know anything about the robbery at my store?" Do you know something? No idea. That son of a bitch is lying! The nice young man says you're lying. Ok Listen, what happened is really shitty. Keep the cash. Couldn't Milan fill the gap now? Milan is a careless fucker. He doesn't have his business under control. And not his people, either. Tell me one reason why I shouldn't pull the trigger now. What do you need? More money? Money? I've lost one of my men. How much is my pain worth? I'll tell you what I need. New smugglers. Are you fucking with me? Listen I'll keep the drugs the cash and I'll take care of your business in the future. Do you think you can convince Milan that this is the right decision for him? You're really trying to fuck with me. Psssh Of course. Anything else I should know? No. Is Moritz in the bathroom? He's not here. Hey Moritz. How did you get in here? Did you forget that Milan is paying for this apartment? What do you want from me? What do you know about this Eric guy? What happened to your face? Nothing. A little accident. Where are we going? We found out that Eric is a rat. APARTMENT! SOMETHING'S WRONG… I don't know who you're talking about. Don't lie to me! Are you ready? Did something come up? I really don't know. Why so quiet? Just tired. Does it have something to do with the others? After everything that happened, you still want to go through with this? Tell me where Moritz is! You would've just had to tell me where he is! Where is he! Eric, it's escalated. As soon as they find something out it's over! You… you're in this just like the rest of us. Everything's gonna be ok. Get out! Get out, Moritz, I don't want to have to say it again. And now? Just go ahead! Go! Eddy, what are you doing? I knew from the beginning that something was wrong there. - Eddy, I can explain… - Shut up! Did you really think you'd get by with this shit? Eddy, please… Anna was a lot stronger than you! What...? LET'S MEET AT YOUR PLACE And he really didn't call you? No. He's caused a lot of problems, that I have to pay for now! If he contacts you, do yourself a favour and call me, ok? I'm sorry about what happened. Don't worry about the costs for the funeral. I think it's ok for you if we keep you on our radar for a while now, right? It's better that way. ANONYMOUS How long do you still want to keep writing your book?
