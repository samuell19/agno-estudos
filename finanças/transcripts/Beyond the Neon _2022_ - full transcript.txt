I'm a nurturing person. I am a mom, so I just-- I love humans and people, and so watching somebody else go through that is... extremely hard. You're a mom? I am a mom. I don't care what people say, I am still a mom. My son was murdered by my pimp when he was two years, eight months, and 13 days old. Why? I didn't show up to an appointment. Have a seat right here, please. Before we get started, can I get you anything? -Glass of water? Coffee? -Uh, no, thanks. I'm good. Great. Okay. Like I said before, we just wanna get some information from you. If you can please state your name for the record. What's up, guys? Joey Salads here, and, uh, this is my school photo. What's up, guys? Joey Salads here. What's up, guys? Joey Salads here and today we're gonna be doing a prank to see if people will let me free. Can you guys let me out? Can you let me out real quick? Can you let me out?. Leave the bag. Yo, that's my bag, dude. Get back here. Oh! Mind your baby, it's hitting my damn foot. Go! So, my crew and I, we started out doing pranks, and then it evolved into social experiments. It's Joey Salads here and today we're gonna be doing a social experiment. It's a social experiment comparing two different situations, and you can interpret it however you want. Want some more candy? Yeah? Okay, come with me. We'll go get more. Oh my God! Where are you girls going? - Where are you going? - To the after-party. -You gonna come? -I like your car. What after-party? Why'd you girls get in a car with me? Do you even know who I am? I could have been an abductor. I could've raped you guys. I could've done something horribly wrong with you guys. -Are you driving? -Why does it bother-- What is it-- is it a problem? -'Cause you're clearly drunk. -So, what does that mean? -You can't drive drunk. -What are you, are you cops? - I'm not a cop-- - So, who the are you if I drive drunk? You know, we're clearly doing a video on-- What the is this about? Come on. Uh, 20 minutes. -20 minutes. -I waiting no 20 minutes -for a cab. -Can you come-- Let's go in for another drink and wait for the cab. -Are you buying the drink? -I'll buy you a drink -while we wait. All right? -I'm down for that... Please drop this video a like and share it because it could possibly save a life. I'm Joey Salads and thanks for watching. Still rolling. Keep walking back, though, 'cause it's-- it gets awkward when I stop. It's gonna stop in a minute again. Let's see what happens. What's up, guys? Joey Salads here. Now, you may have seen these cards being handed out all the time on the Vegas Strip. I set out with my friend, Lisa, who's actually seen on this card, who's been in the industry for 16 years, to expose the truth about the prostitution ring behind these very cards, and what we found was very, very scary. And I'm about to share that footage with you right now. Check it out. All right. So, right now we actually, uh, got some of the cards from off the street and we're gonna call one of the numbers on one of them and get one of the escorts to show up. Hello? Yeah. I got one of the cards off the street and I wanna-- -Yeah. -Order a girl. Sure. Where are you staying, honey? I'm in, uh, uh, uh,. Okay. And is it just you? -Yeah, it's just me. -Okay. I can send you over the girls. It'll be $150 to get the party started, anything after that is discussed between you guys. -Are you ready now? -Yeah, I'm ready. What's the room number? So, she's gonna knock at the door and then you just answer. She's gonna come in and you're gonna hand her the money. And then she's going to probably go into the bathroom and then she'll come out and she'll sit down on the bed. That's how, like, normal escorting gigs start? -Yeah. -They come in, they take the money, they go off on their own, -they come back, and-- -Yep. -All right. -And it goes from there. -All right. Ready. Let's do it. -Okay. Test. - Hey. - Hi. - What's up? - How are you? I'm good. Good. How are you? -I'm great, thank you. -All right, cool. -Want me to pay you now? -Yeah. -Here you go. -Thank you. I'm gonna just take a moment really quick. All right. Here, sit-- sit right over here. So... Instead of, you know, doing things, is it all right if I just ask you a couple questions instead? You wanna-- you just wanna talk? Yeah, I just wanna talk. Is that all right with you? -All right, yeah, whatever. -Sure? Mm-hmm. I'm just curious... why are you doing this? -Like, what? -Like why are you-- Oh, uh, for school. Trying to pay your way through school? -Yeah. -What school do you go to? Uh, University of Las Vegas. -What's your major? -Nursing. -Nursing? -Mm-hmm. If I give you an extra $200, do you think you can tell me the truth... about why you're really doing this? So, how did you get involved in all this? What got you started? You have some sort of, like, fetish or something? -You like story or do you-- -I'm-- I'm just looking-- I don't understand what I'm supposed to do right now. I just wanna know. I'm just curious to know why someone would be involved in this. Um... I don't know. I was-- I was 18. I had just gotten kicked out by my foster parents and, uh-- Mm-hmm. I guess I was struggling a little bit and I met, uh, this guy and he's my boyfriend now. Um, he takes care of me and that's kind of that. So, you met a guy who takes care of you, but you have to... go out and do stuff like this? Does he make you do this stuff? Yeah. I'm-- Is it something you wanna do? Is he really taking care of you if he's making you do this stuff? Where are these assumptions coming from? I'm just curious. 'Cause it sounds like-- it sounds like it may not be your choice to do this. -Is it? -But it is my choice. You chose to do this 'cause you wanna do it? No. No? Since it-- since it doesn't seem like something that you wanna do, why don't you just stop? You should-- it's not that simple, even if I wanted to stop. You can't just get up and leave and-- -No? -not look back? No. What would happen if you do that? I don't have money. I can't just leave. What if I was to help you out and give you some money and help you get started? No. I-- You can figure out a way. I'll help you. I can help you in anything you need. If you wanna get out of this. -We can go right now. -They could kill you for this. Why are you going? Where are you going? Because this is-- I've gotta go. I can't be here. Asking me to answer those fucking questions. Are you going back? I mean, you don't have to go back. Just-- I-- I can't be here, okay? -And you can't be fucking-- -Why-- why do-- why are you-- - I don't even know you. - Don't follow me. In the footage, she refused to come with me. I even asked her, like, "Hey, I-- I-- I'll help get you back on track. I'll give you money, I'll help you find a job." And she just stormed out. Well, why would she wanna entertain that when every man that's ever presented herself in her life has wanted something from her? How-- how much money do you think she makes in a night? -Like, what's the average? -well, most quotas is anywhere from a thousand and up. So, it all just kind of depends on the trafficker you're dealing with. How much percent does she get to take from that? - Nothing. - Nothing? How many people actually make it out? One to 2% of us make it out. The majority of these women are statistically destined to... To be murdered. -To be murdered. -Mm-hmm. I don't know. I was-- I was 18. I'd just gotten kicked out by my foster parents and, um... I guess I was struggling a little bit and then I met, uh, this guy and he's my boyfriend now. Um, he takes care of me and that's kind of that. You chose to-- You do this 'cause you wanna do it? No. No. No. Tracy's on her phone again. What are you doing? You on break? Tracy? Oh, what? What's wrong? What's wrong? Hey, are you okay? I found my sister. What? Your sister's an escort? Okay. Rolling. When I disrespect a police officer, let's see how people react. - Hey, excuse me. - Yes. You're a female officer, right? Hmm. Officer. Yes. -You're a female though, no? -What can I do for you, sir? Uh, what does that mouth do? -Excuse me? -Yeah. You're a female, no? Maybe you should learn some respect-- I wanna see what those-- Oh! Oh! Oh, God! Oh, what the fuck was that about? All right. All right, all right, all right. Should we cut? Yeah. Damn dude. You all right? They keep running away, huh? They don't give a fuck. At least they didn't record like the last people. Yo. I gotta dump this card. Felix has gotta take a dump. Hey, that's good. That was good. That was good. Bro, it's shit. -What? You don't like it? -Nah, bro. We keep doing the same shit over and over again. Just stupid prank, stupid prank. What happened to what we used to do? We used to do some ground-breaking shit. -Get people talking. -Yeah. Get people sharing. We're not doing that anymore. Yeah. Well, we can't. I mean, we gotta keep it so PC now. We gotta say, "Fuck it," bro. It's gonna get taken down, then. There is all these messages we've been getting on that old escort video. I-- I've been reading those. It's-- Some girl, she's probably just trying to get money off of us. The one-- Wait, who? The one who says it's her sister? -Yeah. -How can she even tell when the face is blurred? I don't trust that shit. She's probably trying to siphon our audience. If anything, just tell her to prove it. So, I get messages all the time about my videos. But this girl, Tracy, she reached out and she said the escort in the video was her sister. I blurred her face. There's only one way she could have known. Told you not to touch my stuff. Dude, that's my curling iron. Stop! I'm almost done. Oh my God! I thought we were gonna hang out tonight. Wow! I'll let you borrow my jeans. -The black ones? -Yeah. They're not gonna fit you anyway 'cause you're so short. We're practically like the same height. Uh, no, we're not. I almost burnt myself. She sent a picture, too. That's her. We need to find her, reunite them and we'll have the most viral video we've ever had before. This is it. Wait, you wanna go back to Vegas on some sort of vigilante rescue mission? - Mm-hmm. - This is serious shit. People get murdered for fucking with this. And that's-- that's why this is gonna go so viral. Do you know how heartwarming this video will get? This will get hundreds of millions of hits, reuniting these two on camera. No, you don't get it. You're fucking with somebody's business. This is our business, too. We're doing this. Set up a meeting with Tracy. We're doing it. Hey, Tracy, it's Walter. We're on the way now. We'll be there at 2:00. Hit me back if you need anything, all right? Later. Ugh. Sorry, I was supposed to get off earlier, but, um, I got stuck. Let me introduce you to my mom. Uh, just gimme a sec. Mom, they're here. I told you to get ready. They wanna talk to us about Kyla. There's nothing to talk about. I don't want anybody in my house. Mom, look at me. They're here to help. Okay? They talked to her. The police haven't even done that. I don't care. Calma. Get them outta my house. Excuse me. So, my name's Joey and I met your daughter, Kyla, and we think that she's in danger. What do you mean? Here. Joey Salads here-- Wait. Wait, wait. I haven't shown her that yet. I met this guy. He's my boyfriend now. He takes care of you but you have to do stuff like this? What are you-- what are you trying to say? She's a-- Well, no, no. We-- we think that she's being forced to do this. How could you not tell me, Tracy Diane? Sorry, I-- I'll figure out a way. I'll help you. I can help you with anything you need. We can go right now. Oh, I've seen enough. Let's stop recording. It just doesn't make any sense that she wouldn't have reached out. Her boyfriend tore this family apart. Hey, um, save it for the interview. -Do I look okay? -You look great. And relax, okay? We got you on this. So, when did you notice something was off? I was having medical issues. I had to go into assisted living for eight months. Kyla was only 17. She wasn't allowed to stay here alone. She only had to live in a group home for a little while. We-- we had no choice. Did you have to do foster care, too? Actually, I was abroad studying on a scholarship. I didn't wanna give up that opportunity. That was around the time that she met Banks. - Banks? - Her boyfriend. We always hated living here and wanted to leave. He kind of seemed like her way out. That was from the last time that we really hung out. We weren't on good terms. Um, every time we talked, it would just be a big argument. You know, I left everything to come home and all she cared about was Banks. Lo siento, mija. I just miss her so much. I don't wanna get my hopes up anymore. Ms. Collins, I know this is difficult, but I've met Kyla. I've been in the same room as her. I can tell that she feels trapped. So, my team and I are gonna do everything that we can do to find her, let her know that she's loved, and let her know that there is a way out. She hasn't gone with you before, why would she go with you now? Do you have to do that? It's after hours. -I don't know. It's fucked up. -No, come on. Let's go. - Come on, let's go. - Come on, come on. Before it changes. Like 6:00, you think? -That early? -We gotta get there. It's only a four-hour drive. But you know that Joey's gonna make us bring Tracy? No. She's such a liability. She can't come. Yeah, we'll find her in Vegas and reunite them back here. Why not? Yo, up here, motherfuckers. What's up? Hey, what's your code again? I don't really care. We'll do the video, but Tracy can't come, bro. That's the whole point. It's gonna get views. But what if Tracy gets hurt? I'm gonna do all the dangerous stuff. As soon as we find the sister, we just reunite them. What are we supposed to do with Tracy in Vegas until then? Or what if her sister doesn't wanna be found? Like, Tracy totally abandoned her in foster care. Well then, that's the video. That's real life. That's what's happening. -It's a win-win. -Bro, it's a bad idea. What? You wanna go back to tasing me in the bar? Or making stupid gold digger pranks? You have a brother. Don't you have sisters? Yeah. Wouldn't you wanna be there if it was them? Hey guys? Okay, look, if you ask me if Kayla's gonna be living with anybody, it is gonna be her sister. So she has to be coming with us. Like, it is what it is. I'm sorry, guys. And see how people react, and, and that's what generates a lot of shock value. But you guys do more than pranks, right? I mean, I've seen videos with, like, messages. Yeah. Yeah. Those are the social experiment videos. So those are more serious than the pranks. Do you guys ever get into trouble? I mean, all the time. If we're not getting in trouble, we're not doing our job right. But at the end of the day, when the video's done and produced and out there online, the people viewing now know how to react to these real-life situations that can actually help people. -Like Kyla? -Yeah, like Kyla. Okay, so this is the number we called before for the escort service -when we got Kyla. -Nice. $69. Cute. It's the price to get the girl to the room, and then you gotta tip. Someone knows a lot about escorts. We shot that video with the escorts in Vegas. Okay. And I was in a bachelor party once, and the guys ordered an escort. What? I didn't call. I just can't imagine having to do that for a living. And then giving the money to someone else after? No way. She was always way more caring than me. She was better with my mom too. I remember this one time when we were kids we had all these traps for mice in the garage, and one day I go in there and there's a dead mouse caught in one of the traps. And she wrapped the mouse in a towel, like, so carefully and then she asked-- she asked if we could put padding on the traps, that way it wouldn't hurt the mice as much next time. Oh, I have to pee. We're here. We're here. I'm gonna go do a lap around the casino and text you when I'm done. Okay. Try not to draw attention. No cameras. Hey guys. So they wouldn't let me check in with the unmarked cards. I had to use my personal... - Joe? - But here it is. Shit man! We can't be leaving footprints like that. What do you mean? You never know who's paid off, I said there's so much. Like you have to go outside the casino. Oh, shit, bro. Okay. So I don't know. A little to the right. We gotta see the door right there. Yeah, that's, that's better. Perfect. All right. Felix. Got audio levels, camera is locked, and it's transmitting signals. So I think we're all good, bro. Cool. Uh, 4K USB cam? That one over there. Uh, put that one on the table. All right, can you guys hear Joey in there? Test. Test. Yeah, I can hear him. - Marlow? - Marlow, come here. - Marlow coming here? - Sid, really, bro? Come on! - Sorry dude. - Thank you. So escape route number one, okay? Second floor here of the west wing, all the way to the back self parking garage, all right? Side entrance. But what if we can't go that way? But what if I knew you would say that and made a second route that won't show. God. So we'll hop the monorail over to Sid's SUV, okay? Probably just overkill, but, uh, it's precaution. Is that it? Pretty much. We're ready to go. Let's do this. All right, dude. Looks good. - Are you guys rolling? - Oh, yeah. All right, cool. All right. So we're gonna be calling this number and we're gonna be asking for Sasha. - Sasha? - Sasha is her alias, uh, and, uh, you know, she's not gonna go by her meal name. Yes. I'm looking for one of your girls. Uh, she might be working tonight. Sasha. She's got long dark hair. All right. The card number is... 8 4 3 2 8 9 0 4 8 2 8 4 8. Oh my gosh! All right. Hey, are you okay? You all right? It's just like a lot. They're, like, selling my sister. Well, this is gonna be the last time. Sorry, I'm just trying to pad the mouse trap for you. Come on, let's go get your sister. All right guys. Come on. Come on. Get in the surveillance room. Let's go. No, no, you gotta go. - Hey. - Hey. Hi. How are you? Good. So your real name is Sasha. - What happened? - Marlow? It-it's the signal. The walls are too thick. -Come on. -I know, I've already set it. It's fro-- it's fro-- Why are you doing that? Why are you doing that with your fingers? -Come on. -Mm! Wait. Damn it! The Sasha I'm looking for-- -It's not her. --has dark hair. Forget about her, baby. How much fun do you wanna have tonight? Listen, do you know Sasha that works for the same company as you? I'm trying to find her. I don't know Sasha. It's only me tonight. Her real name is Kyla. And I believe she's being forced to work as an escort and I'm trying to find her. Are you a fucking cop? Listen, I gave you $400. The least you can do for me is just-- just answer and help me out. Am I being detained, or am I free to leave? I--I just-- I just need you to answer-- Stop! It's not what you think. -What the hell is going on here? -My sister's missing. - Please. - Stop. Let her go. Let her go. Her name's Kyla. Kyla! Damn it Tracy! Well, it's exactly what we are afraid of. It's cool, bro. We're just getting started. It's different seeing them in real life. Not just some photo on a card. I think that's the goal. If they seem too human, it'll ruin the illusion. Plus, I'm out 400 bucks. - Get out, go. - She's here. She's here. She's back, she's back, she's back. - Get down. - Don't stop rolling. - Hands up! - What the fuck-- Put your hands where I can see 'em. We still may have some camera feeds. Oh, oh, oh. Chill. Chill. Chill, chill, chill. -Oh, damn! -Oh! Oh, christ! What are you doing? Are you fucking kidding me, bro? Dude, gotta be fucking kidding! -Fuck. -Oh, God! Let's see what this creep is up to. You're in shit. Up. Get up. - What's the charge? - Move. Move! What is the charge? Bitch. It could have been anything. It could have been my personal credit card that was on file, or the Russian escort. It could have even been the bellhop or the security guards, or even the ride share. Everybody's in on this from the top-down. And somebody on the inside... tipped them off. Shh! Shh! Down. Shh! Quiet! Hey, we got him. - Shit! - We gotta go! We gotta go! We gotta go! Go ahead. Through here. Go, go, go, go. Sid, Sid, Sid, what happened? -Go, go. Go through. -Okay. Wait. Guys, wait. Oh my God! What about Joey? -We have to wait. -We have to go. -Listen to me: We have to go! -Why are we running? -Leave! -What about Joey? - Go! - Sorry. Wait. Hold on. Hold on! Let's go, let's go! Don't worry about that. Just stay focused right now, okay? I just feel like it's my fault. Yeah. It kinda is your fault, all right? You ran in and you can't do shit like that. I'm sorry. Okay. So what are we gonna do now? We gonna get another hotel somewhere? Don't worry about what we're gonna do. We just gotta get the hell out of the street right now. Feel like I have a target on back with this gear. Hey, I know-- I know someone who can help. Now arriving at-- Yo, Marlow, Marlow! What's up Marlow? How are you? Yeah, Yeah. Uh, yeah. So you're cool with five of us? -They're--they're cool. -Yeah, yeah. It's cool. That's cool. You got-- Yo, what's with the cameras? Long story. Uh, hey guys, this is Sunday. Hi, Sunday. Tracy. -Nice to meet you. -You're good. So that's your ex, huh? Very ex. Oh, uh, they're just fucking around. They're not recording. Hey, yo, yo, yo! Sunday? Sunday? No, don't shoot. Don't shoot. They're not recording. It's good. They're not recording. It's good. -Same old tricks, huh? -Never know what they gonna do. Oh, fucker! That's a pretty name. Tracy? -Tracy. -Tracy. -You from around here? -No. -Where you from? -Not here. -No. You like music? -Mm-hmm. Well, you gotta come to my studio. You gotta hear my boy Space. He's pretty nasty, I'm telling you. Really? Wow! Cool. Mm-hmm. - You got a pretty smile. - Yo! So no arrest records online yet. Oh, but should we post about it? #freeJoeySalads... again? Hey, bro, thanks for letting us chill. Yeah, it's all good man. It's all good, bro. -Sunday, right? -Yeah. High Sunday. Oh. You have a collect call from an inmate at Clark County Detention Center, press one. - They've charged me. - Hey, Joe. - I can't hear you. - Joey? Bro, they fucking charged me for impersonating a police officer. It's bullshit! These charges won't stick. I'll see you tomorrow. All right. Bye. - Yo, Sunday. - Ah, I'm out, Papi. I-I'm late. Um, you always got that good , though, Papi. I appreciate that. And you guys, you guys are pretty cool too. Um, especially-especially you. Ay, ay, ay. Here. I'm gonna give you my card. I want you to call me. -Thank you. -Yeah, we get together and we hang out? All right, Tracy? Cool. Yeah. Yo, we're bopping. - Oh, shit. I need to go man. - Yo. All right. So what's the deal of this guy's business card? -Nothing. -Okay, look, so this reminded me -of Lisa's escort card. -Mm-hmm. Okay. Kyla probably has a card out there somewhere, right? So if we find the card, then we find my sister. Maybe. So we just left the strip and you guys wanna go back? It's where the escort cards are. -Yeah. -I feel like the cops already have description of us anyway. Yeah. And Joey's supposed to be the one doing the risky stuff, and now you're pushing Tracy back out there. No, no, no. This is my idea, okay? And we-we'll be fine. It's just two of us. Plus I changed my clothes. Hey, it's better than staying here at the drug dealer's house. He's not actually a drug dealer. That's just his side hustle. He's actually a rapper and could I have connections or-- Oh, God! He's a rapper? -Yeah. -Oh, come on! -What? -That's so cliche. -What? -Okay. Why don't you stay -with the rapper or dealer-- -Yeah, maybe I will. Okay. See if he has any connections for Kyla. Yeah. Have fun on the strip. You know, the south side of the, like, I don't understand that so I couldn't tell you. Where's the strip? Is this not the fucking strip right here? This is Paradise Road? There's another one right there, guys. -Go get it. Right there. -Go, let's go. Thank you. Can I get a few more? Thank you. Two more? Thank you. Can I get a few more? Can I get some? Thank you. Thank you. Can I have some? Thanks. Like, some of them look like they could be. No, it's Asian. Like there was one that I had seen-- No. Now I feel like a slapper. Can I get some please? No? Nice tank top. Can I get one? What the fuck? I'm feeling a little uncomfortable, but we still have to get some. Like, we don't have nearly enough. I've looked through the cards briefly and, like, I'm not seeing Sasha anywhere. You know? Oh no. What? -Dude... -What? We only got like, I don't know, 3 or 4 more. They won't give me more than a few. Like maybe two at a time and it's like-- We gotta change this real quick. Let me get that. Thanks, bro, I'll be right back. Yeah. I get the white ones for you on Friday. You better. I see you, bro. I see you. Make sure you cut me outta that. You know what I mean? So you know what's been weird to me is, like, all these escorts we've seen so far, like, none of 'em are strung out. Well, think about it: like if you sell dope, you get paid and you're out of dope. But if you sell girls, you get paid and you still have the girls, you know what I mean? And just sell 'em over and over? It costs more to get 'em addicted, you gotta cover that, you know what I mean? It's better just to get in their head. I was about to bounce to the studio if you want to get them, bring the cameras, record me while I'm in the booth. And you chop it up like old days. I mean, those guys aren't just gonna volunteer information. Old tricks. -Oh, God. -Look at this kid on the bike. He just gave that guy a bunch of cards. Right there on the bike. -Okay. -Follow him. Is it just a bunch of escort cards in those bags? Wait, I see him, I see him there. Right there. Hey, bro? Hey, where'd you get all the escort cards? Who gave 'em to you? Who gave you all the escort cards? Don't worry about it. Just go in. Hey. Hey. What's up man? Yo. Hey you guys remember Marlow? -Gabriela, this is Marlow. -What's up? She a artist though. She's super fire. -Real shit. Real shit. -That's cool. Chill, chill, chill. They all good. They don't care about any of this. They're just here with her. They're gonna get me doing my thing in the booth. It's all good. Good? You wanna get your boy in on this? Yeah, let's go. Why is this kid running? That's him. That's him right there. Yeah, that's him. He's right there-- Hey! This kid wouldn't run if he wasn't hiding something. Damn! He's fast. -Why you running bro? -Don't lose him. Hey! Stop! I got kids! Wait! Wait! -Move! -Go, go! Careful! Watch out! What? Damn it! Where the fuck did he go? Wait, wait, wait. Tracy? Tracy, wait, wait, wait! Look! Tracy, here's the bike. Hey, over here! Hey, over here! - Okay, let's go. Let's go. - Where'd he go? So Sunday said you might know how to find this girl I'm looking for? I dunno anything about branded girls. -Branded? -Yeah. Her tattoo. Wait, what's her tattoo mean? She's someone's property. -How'd you get it? -You got it! You got it! Get us the fuck outta here! Drive this car! -Why? -'Cause they're fucking-- Damn, dude. Fuck! -Drive! Drive! -He has a wrench. Fucking go! -Go on, drive! Drive, dude! -Let's go, motherfuckers! -Just fucking drive! -I'm driving as fast as I can. -Fuck dude! -Dude, run the stop sign. Keep going. We lost him. He's gone. He's gone. -Are you guys okay? -What did you do? -That was him. He got away-- -That was the kid? --and we caught up to his bike-- Yes. Runs like a man. He's got a fucking wrench! We got the bag though. Ouch! Shit! Same tattoo. Got it! I don't know. They went to go get a lap dance? Girls are trafficked at the strip clubs. They've branded like cattle. All you gotta do is find the one with the right brand. Like, I've never really even been to a strip club, I don't even really know what to do. It's gonna go a lot farther if a girl goes in than a guy. The dancers are gonna feel more open and trusting -and their walls are down. -All right. So put this down the front. And sort of, like, in between the-- the red. -In between? -Yeah. -Won't they see it? -It's all right. Don't worry. Don't worry, don't worry. Okay, come here... And then I'm gonna attach this to your necklace. -I got it. You're good. -Okay guys, let's-- let's make sure we got some levels. Uh, check, check. Uh, going to find some tattoo-- -Louder. -Going to find some tattoos. -Louder. -Check, check. You charged 'em? Okay, here you go. Oh, yeah. -How you doing, Tracy? -Okay. Do we gotta feed? Uh, yeah. -Oh! -Yeah, we're good. Wow! It connects to your phone? -All right. -Guys, we're good to go. -Save my wife and me one. -Thank you. -Can I get you anything, honey? -Vodka rocks, please. Yeah! Whoo! Well, hello, beautiful. -Hello, yourself. -You come here alone?. -I'm looking for a friend. -I can be your friend. Let's go somewhere private. Yeah! Hey! Let's do it! Let's do it! Hello, lady. Those guys were not it. Uh, this looks a little short. They were fucking wasted when they got here. I give it 15 minutes before the girls complain. How do you expect me to find sober clientele this time of night? That's your job, isn't it? Not my problem. Give me my money, cunt! Oh hell no! Keep rolling. Oh! Get the fuck off me! Why don't you mind your fucking business. You made it our business! -Hey, hey, don't touch her. -Get the shit off me! Hey! Hey! Hey! Practically every girl in here has a dollar sign tattoo. Sorry. Do you know Banks? Mm... I think there's an ATM out front. No, his name is Banks,. Banks? Are you fucking with me? -No, no. You don't understand. -No, you don't understand. -We're done here. Security? -Please, I'm sorry. I'm going. I'm going. Don't come back here, you fucking dyke! - Wait, wait. Oh, oh, oh. - You guys, get outta here. All right, all right. We're getting outta here. I'll call the police and I'll tow your car. Get going. Hey, look over there. Uh... Um... Huh? Why don't you just get a whiskey? Unless they have mezcal. Come here.. Wait, hold still. Thank you. You're dripping all over your fucking shirt. - Yeah. - Are you okay? -Well, I'm okay. -Okay. Oh, sorry. You look like shit, Tracy. All right? Yeah. I think the bleeding stopped. Okay. Um, guys, if you, uh, you guys want out, I understand. -Are you giving up on us? -Shut up. No! Like, I'm gonna get you guys hurt. -Really hurt. -This shit happens all the time. Joey's always getting beat up. Death threats on the rag. So you're the new Joey. You're bleeding all over the fucking bottle. Sorry. I'm sorry. No, but seriously. Look, seriously, just shut up and pass the bottle. There he is. - What are you doing? - God! Looking for Kyla. You turned the cameras on? If I find her, I wanna be on camera. - How is your little... - Hmm. -It's gonna scar. -Yeah, it's alright. At least it wasn't my brother, or you. Tracy can take a hit. Yeah, I was kind of noticing that. - She's crazy. - Yeah. I'm the one who messed up. How so? I told that dancer about Banks, and now he could know we're on to him. -He could know you're onto him. -Ugh! I know. I'm so outta my league. This is why we need Joey. Don't worry about it. I am worried about it. This is super dangerous. I have no idea how we're gonna pull this off, but I'm happy to be doing something important. And I'm glad to be here. I'm glad you're here too. I wonder how many of these girls are actually being forced to do this? How are you doing with all this, Tray? My sister used to call me that. Do we have to film this? Joey said to film everything, so. Yeah. What? I can't find anywhere to sell us a bulletproof vest. -Bulletproof? -Yeah. She had a gun pulled on her last night. We had to protect ourselves. Have you tried this mom-and-pop shop called Vest World? No. I'll send you details now. Okay. Listen... I've been hit by a bull before. I've been chased by people. I even received thousands of death threats online. But it's normally my face that's out there. And I was still locked up in here, so my crew needed a way to protect themselves. -It's the right address, right? -It says we're here. Um, Tracy-- Tracy? You can't just walk away. Tracy? Did you eat today? - Huh? What? - Yo Walter-- I put frozen dinners in the freezer for ya. Check this out. I told you, we can't come back yet. I'm sorry -Ma'am. Excuse me. -Can I help you? Sid, get back. Get back. Can I ask what you're doing on this particular street? Nothing. Why? Is there any reason why you're by yourself? I have a friend coming. Am I being detained? No. I just wanna give you something... just in case. You be careful out here. Take care of yourself. Uh, hey man. Yeah. We're here at your store, Vest World. Yeah, we wanna buy some bulletproof vests. Um, level 3-A. Oh, shit. What did he give you? Is that a ticket? Um, nope. Looks like he thinks I'm a prostitute. -What's Destiny House? -I don't know. I just don't understand why you can't sell us the vest if it's not illegal. Look, I'm responsible for the people I sell them to. If you were to get caught up in some shit, I don't need the fingers pointed back at me. I'm sorry. It's just too much liability. Please, please. There's gotta be something you can do. We need to find my sister. Look, she's somewhere here in Vegas being trafficked, okay? And these guys are putting everything on the line to find her. We got a gun pulled on us last night. We need protection. I'm sorry about your sister. Hope you find her. I just can't take the risk. Come on man. You don't want the cash? I'm sorry. -Damn it! - Nice try, Tracy. - Asshole! Hold on, I have an idea. Where's that flyer? So we're in the middle of the desert at this, uh, weird location waiting for a representative from this organization to come bring us to Destiny House. It's a safe house for women who've been trafficked. And, yeah, we called the number on the flyer. We're gonna actually meet with the founder, Annie Lober. They won't let us record going in, so I guess just cut for now and, yeah. Cut for now, bitches! Yeah, we're with them. Uh, for Annie Lober. Can we go? -Hi. -Hi, it's Walter. -Hi, Walter. Nice to meet you. -Hi. Nice to meet you too. -Thanks so much for this. -You're welcome. -Welcome to Destiny House. -Thank you. This is our little retreat to take care of the ladies that get out of sex trafficking in Las Vegas. We are in a very secure location, and we make sure that none of the ex-traffickers -know where the girls are. -Right. And so this is a very safe haven for them to recover from. -Gotcha. -So you wanna see the property? -Yeah, please. That'd be great. -Yeah, very peaceful. Yeah, it is very nice over here. Girls can go swimming. We have exercise. The girls have equine therapy. A little bit of tennis and cooking classes. -Everything else like that, so. -Equine with horses? - Yeah. - Nice. We love the horses. The girls love horses. So any meetings that we need with the community or with different states or Washington DC, so-- -Mm-hmm. -This is where like the hub is. I call it the beehive. This is your main facility? Yeah. The traffickers found three of the girls that we had in one of our homes, and they came into the home and they brought guns, did drugs, and then proceeded to have sex with several of the ladies. We had to shut that house down 'cause these were not nice guys. So what about here though? We've never, to date, had this property compromised. -Do you have security here? -Yes we do. -And they're packing. -Yeah. We've got cameras everywhere. So if you're gonna be on our property, you will be filmed. -Right. -Do these girls-- Do you know or do they ever talk about, like, reaching back out to their family? One of the things that the traffickers focus on is relationship. And if they can get into the girl's heart, they got them for their life. Because once the heart is involved, with that relationship and they love that person, or that person becomes their mama figure or their father figure, they're hooked for life. It's really important that ladies and victims of trafficking have a safe place to land, a safe place to go. Oh, you can't film over here, please. Stop. We have a tattoo remover artist that takes off the tattoos, and in phases. That shows ownership for that stable of women towards that one trafficker, and if they are passed around, they can actually charge each trafficker a fee. So your tattoo artist might have seen this brand before? Yes. Very possible. She's like, "I wanted to break free, I wanna break free, but I don't know anything else." -Right. -And she was being under a lot of pressure, and being trafficked that way. Complex trauma is debilitating. It is a lifelong sentence in a lot of people. -Am I right or wrong? -Yeah. It can last years, and part of your brain shuts down. Sexual trauma is-is serious, especially developmentally. What's. like, the worst kind of therapist that they could get? I don't even wanna say. Can I say it? Gives them a bunch of drugs, "I don't wanna hear your problems. Take this, take that, take this, and call back in six months and tell me how you're doing." Well, by then they'll be dead because they'll kill themselves. Because trauma does not get healed by drugs. -By pills. No. -Nope. She-- No she didn't-- she didn't see-- Hey, I wanna introduce you to Rhonda. Yeah. Hi Rhonda. Hi. Nice to meet you. I've known her for 27 years. She's like the business. She runs everything when I'm not around and when I'm here. The reason why I've known her for so long is because... I was what's known as a phone girl. Uh, when she was a high class call girl, I used to send her out on the calls. -That was my job. -When she was working? Yeah. Yeah. -Hey, Marlow? -Hey. Um, I was just talking to the survivors, and it sounds like they wanna talk to us. -Really? -Mm-hmm. They think that they would do it on camera? If I-if I ask you a question and you don't want to answer it, you don't have to. If we need to stop at any point, if we need to cut, no problem. And, uh, we'll just start from the beginning. Um, yeah, I think we're ready. Are you guys about set up? -Yeah. We're all set up. -Okay. Oh, my earliest memory, I was four years old. - Four? - I was four years old when I first remember my parents selling me. So I worked for my biological parents until I was, uh, 17. Did you ever try to get away? There wasn't any getting away. How do you-- how do I trust a police officer who I just serviced the night before, right? Or a pastor going to a different church and then I walk in and one of their deacons is a client from two weeks ago. And so, I didn't see any hope in getting out. So I met my ex trafficker in. I had did a photo shoot that was for a magazine that was based out here, um, in Vegas, and I'm from California originally. And actually it was on a website called Model. The trafficker that I had, um, you know, wines and dines you, buys you clothes, does this and that. Treats you, takes you to all the fancy expensive restaurants, go buys you designer bags, whatnot. He is well known in the music world, and modeling, and he has his own agency that he runs. An escort agency, he has so many girls. Oh, when I was about 16, um, I was dating a guy and, like, months later he came to me, "If we wanna make something happen, you know, you need to like get some money and--" He told me that we're gonna build an empire together and, you know, it said before when you really love someone, you're just so manipulated you think that you guys are in this together. Oh, 100%. I think there's more mental manipulation than there is anything else. Even just their threats with their words of, "Bring me this much money or else." Finding your family, pulling your family up on their phone. How much money would you make? It depends on how long I would be out, but $1,000 to $1,500 a day. You don't really sleep. I might lay down for three hours, if that, but you're always working. You have enough time hopefully to get a baby wipe, get some mouthwash, and then get back to it. And people have weird fetishes. When guys either want you to pee on them, poop on them, get other guys semen, pour it on them. I've had condoms break. I've had the guy laugh at me and stick his fist up and pull the condom out, and throw it. When dads bring their kids in, their sons, to say, "This is how you treat a woman," that is when I-- I've had many, many be-beatings because I'm like, "I'm not doing this. This is a 14 year old boy who doesn't need to see this." I got my tattoo September 28th. Two hearts, the key in the middle. It's like a locket and has his initials, J M. And it says eternity. That's that font on it, so it's like his brand. It's kind of like kidnapping. "Too bad you're mine. You're my slave. This is how it's gonna go. You're gonna pay me or you're gonna die." It literally robs you of who you are and what you're destined to be. I've seen him text my mom and seen her reply, and he would say, "I'm gonna kill you" and all this stuff. "Kill your whole family if you keep trying to mess with Ashley." I am a mom. I don't care what people say. I am still a mom. My son was murdered by my pimp when he was two years, eight months and 13 days old. Why? I didn't show up to an appointment. These girls don't even realize that they're being brainwashed. The traffickers force them to fall in love with them. The traffickers own everything from them: their passports, their IDs, their birth certificates, their money, their property. Everything is owned by the trafficker. And then if that fails, the traffickers force them to get pregnant. This way they can threaten the baby and use the baby as leverage. "Oh, you didn't make a few thousand dollars today? We're gonna hurt the child." And a mother will do anything to protect her kids. It's called breeding. -I was not expecting that. -Yeah. I don't blame you for anything. If it were... if it were my sister, I would be jumping into traffic and doing whatever it takes to get her back too. -Kyla needs our help. -Yeah. Well, what if Kyla doesn't really want out. And, um, she thinks she's building an empire with Banks. Then what? I don't know. Those girls are not doing all of this for the money. You know, they're doing it 'cause they think they're-they're getting love from it. Kyla didn't feel loved. Tracy? Tracy? Hey, hey. Stop, stop, stop. Hey listen, you gotta stop beating yourself up, okay? Yeah, that's fine. No, we're not trying to start anything. That's why we came to you 'cause we can't trust the cops out here. I don't wanna say anything in front of the camera. I might know somebody who you can help you out. -Write this number down. -Uh, yeah. Yeah. - You're ready? - Okay. Yeah, I'm ready. 7 0 2 4 6 6 9. All right, thank you. Hey, we got a lead on the vest. If we stop now, then it's all gonna be for nothing. Okay? So let--let's just go, okay, and make this right. -Okay. Okay. -Okay. -I love you, T. -Thank you. I love you too. I guess we are. Let's call mom on speakerphone right now. Fudge. We wanted to give you a call. What are you doing today? Um, I got my hair done, went to McDonald's this morning some and then I-- Oh! Hey, Uncle Bobby told us-- Uncle Bobby told us you had lunch together. Yes we did. Had a wonderful, wonderful lunch time together. -Great. -Good story. The end. Yeah. We love you. We were just thinking about you and had a quick minute and wanted to just holler at you. - Hola, hola, hola. - Well... -Don't die, boys. -We'll do. Love you. Bye, bye. Bye. - Um, do my. - Oh, shit! Oh, man. -Oh, this is where we wanna be? -Left, yeah. I don't want him seeing you, and um, just shoot-- just shoot us. Shoot out the window. -All right. -Bye. tattoo. What's his name again? Mario. Should we get in depth? A tattoo that looks like that. We're looking for any connections to my sister. If, uh, we find someone with a tattoo the same as hers, maybe she'll know how to find her. Check this out. Dollar sign. Double lines. - Wait, you know who this is? - That's Samantha. -No? -That's her? Wow. She's not afraid of being on social like this? A lot of these girls have social media profiles. I wouldn't have thought that working girls - could have accounts. - Have you ever seen anything on social media you wanted to buy? -It's all marketing. -Hold on, hold on. There's a picture here of Kyla with Samantha. Okay. Shit, she's tagged. Oh, my god! That's her? Careful. Wait, so that's-that's Kyla. -I'm gonna DM her. -No, no, no. Don't DM her. It should come from Joey's account. Just remember... she's his property. How you doing? Holy shit. -The white Mr. T. -All right. -Look at those chains, dude. -Nice. Easy. Easy. You got the vest or not? Yeah, I got the vest. Hey, why you asking so many questions, man? -It's the real deal. -Okay. Yeah. Um, and the other five? -What? Five? There's six in total. What the fuck do you need six for? God! Shut up! What the fuck? Yo, bro, you there? Is that a camera? Are you fucking filming me? Yo! Hey, I'm gonna blur your face. That fucking camera. The fuck you gonna blur my face. Stop fucking with. -What the fuck is going on? -Oh shit! Hello. Let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go. Yo, stop kicking around. I'm at the police station, come pick me up and let's get back to work. - I'm free bitches. - Whoo! What's up, bro? What's up, pal? -Welcome back. -Great, dude. Bro, what happened to your face? It's gaping more than my ass. Oh, nice, dick. Listen, we got her bro. We got her. Well, we have a plan to get her tonight. Well, let's go get her. What else did I miss? Oh, you don't wanna know. Um, yeah, so we found her profile and have been messaging her from your account. Uh, she said that she's gonna... Look at those scumbags. Pull up right behind them. -Hey. -Hey. So she just confirmed, Kyla's gonna be here at 10 o'clock tonight. -Nice. -Yeah. -If it's even her. -Oh, come on. What? We get to a hotel, we call a number, we expect someone and they send the complete opposite. We go a freaking blonde last time. Like I'm just not trying to get my hopes up. Sure. Can we just speed this up a little bit? Check in already? -I'm prairie dogging over here. -What? -All right. -I gotta poop. All right. You can do it 'cause Kyla's gonna be here at 10 o'clock. All right, Joey, can you just talk your mic for me? Test, test, testicles. This whole fucking city is a testicle. Yeah, well if your bail wasn't two grand, we'd be staying in a nicer hotel. Not to mention mention Marlow's lap dance. That was totally a business expense. Marlow got a lap dance and I fucking missed it? All right guys, come on back. We're good. We're good. Are you okay? It's just the closest we've got so far. I'm gonna go in first. I'll feel out the situation, but you gotta wait for your cue. Yes, definitely. God, how did guys ever get used to ordering escorts? It still feels so weird to me. You probably get used to after a few hundred times. -Right, Walter? -What do you mean? -Oh, shit. -Thanks a lot dude. -Thought they knew. -Knew what? Did you guys have some sort of escort entourage? No, dude, I just-- I used to work and coordinate for this company that did, like, bachelor parties in LA and Vegas. - You coordinated? - Yeah. I, I coordinated like, for, you know, bottle service and escorts and whatever. -I told you this. -You told me it was once. It's not like I was sleeping with them. Look, I don't need you guilt tripping me more than I already feel, okay? - Please stop! - Holy fuck, guys! Somebody just posted this with the new hashtag. Kyla? Don't hit me, please-- You gotta stop the conversation. Don't hit me! You wanna fucking talk!? please stop. You wanna talk about life here on camera? I am not on camera, please. Yeah? Fucking on camera now, whore. Think I like doing this? I can't. Baby, don't. Please, I love you. Get up, bitch! Please no! This is what happens when you talk to people, okay? It's from six months ago. He knocked out a 95 pound girl. And he wanted to blame that shit on me. What kind of fucking man is that? I can't even imagine how many other girls are going through that same exact shit. What are they supposed to do? Just put makeup over the bruises and go right back to work? All right, everything over here is rolling. Hold on. This was over here. Here we go. -Hello? -Move. So, Joey, where are the cameras? -It's her. -No, Tracy. No, no, no, no, no. No, Tracy. Ah, dipshit. Listen, you were blurred out in that video. -Nobody was supposed to-- -Fuck you! I went through hell because of you. So where are they? Where are the cameras? -Kyla? -Tracy? I can't believe it's really you. I thought you were dead. - Oh, my God. - How are you here? -How are you here? -I've been looking for-- I've been looking for you for seven years. You're so tall. Okay, listen to me. Listen to me. This is really important. You have to leave right now? No. We're here to get you out. -I can't go. -What? Yes, you can. Look, there's a safe house. Okay. There's a safe house. We can take you there. It's gonna be fine. The last time I tried to leave, he said he'd kill you and mom. He's not gonna do that. Tracy, he has photos of you at your job, okay? -You have to leave. -No, no. -Come with me. -Please. You have to leave, okay? -No! -Tracy. He's gonna-- He's coming. Whoa! Who's coming? -Banks? -Banks? Banks is here? Wait! Wait! Kyla, no! No, no, no, no. Come on, come on. Wait, wait, wait! Stop! Joe! Stop! -No, Tracy. -No, you don't understand. - Wait! Tracy, no! - Tracy! Kyla, stop! Stop, stop, stop. Shit! Get the truck. Get the truck! Come on, come on, come on. Um, I think it's just a flesh wound, but we really gotta get her to a hospital. -I'm fine. -Whoa! Shit! At least we know the vest worked. Feels like I got hit by a fucking train. I know. Hold on. I'm doing a U-turn. Hold on. God! I shouldn't have DM'd her from Joey's account. -I'm such a fucking idiot. -I shouldn't have ran after him. -Guys, I'm sorry. -It's my fault. I fucked up. It's my fault she got away. -That's Kyla's. -That her phone? What? -Fuck! -What? They're using it to track each other. Wait, so they can track us right now? We're tracking them. -Turn right. -Right here? Oh, shit! Is that the van? - Is that the van right there? - Shit. Stay back. We gotta get eyes in there. I'll be on channel four. Shh, you guys are fucking loud. Bro,. Let's go. On the move. Wait. Get my back? Get my back? Joe, what are you doing? Is he on the roof? Joe, what are you doing? Get down. Careful guys. Someone's coming out. Is it Kyla? Wait. Kyla? No, it's a guy and-- and two other women. Felix, meet me in the back. Careful, Joe. Felix? Meet me in the back, Felix. All right. They're gone. Should we call Banks? No. I got it. Are you sleepy? Are you sleepy? Yeah. Yeah. All right. Well, past somebody's bedtime. Oh. Oh, shit. - Hmm. - Walt, they're coming back. What? It's okay. It's okay. -Who the fuck are you? -I'm one of Banks' guys. Guys, the van's coming back. Joey? Tracy's outside, we gotta go now. Come on. Tracy's outside? Is she okay? She's gonna be okay, but we just gotta go. Come on. Wait. What? Sasha, what's happening? Is this the guy that Banks wanted? Listen, we gotta go. Come on. Wait. You're leaving with this guy? No, no, no, no, no, no, no. You can't leave me here. Hurry the hell up in there. Imagine what Banks would do to me when you're gone. Come with me. Okay? Come with us. Seriously. Get outta there. -He's coming back. -We gotta go. -Please. Please. -Come on. Let's go. Hold on. I can't leave without my daughter. - Daughter? - Come with us. - Take Kenzie. - We gotta go. Let go of me! Kenzie. They're pulling up! We're running out of time. We gotta go. Kyla, come on! Come on, Banks! Let's fucking go! You didn't think I would find you? Well, I fucking found you. Come at me, bro! You're hiding behind your fucking girls? Tracy? Tracy? Tracy? No! No! No! No! She just bled out on the grass. Why should I trust what you're telling me? It's all on camera. It's all recorded. Just go watch the footage. So, you don't feel responsible? I'm not the one buying those girls.
