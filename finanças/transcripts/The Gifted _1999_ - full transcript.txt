(gentle ethereal music) - [Eddie] When I was a young boy, my father would tell me this story. It was about a famous conductor, the greatest conductor that ever lived, he would say. My older brother Nick and I would listen as he passed down this tale of wisdom, one that was previously passed down from his father and from his father's father, and so on. This famous conductor would step up to the podium and twist the baton between his fingers. (audience applauds) And then he would reach into his pocket and pull out a small piece of paper. Unfolding the paper, he would gaze at its contents. A silence would hush through the auditorium, and it set the musicians afire with burning curiosity. One final look, and he'd put the paper away. He would then raise his baton high, and with a sudden flick of the wrist, down it would come, slicing through the air to fire out the first downbeat. Every performance, the same paper would appear, and its contents remained a mystery. A mystery, until the inevitable happened. People from miles around came to pay their respects. Kings, queens, heads of state, countless music lovers, and of course the many musicians that served him faithfully throughout the years. One by one, they all stepped up to the open casket, and without exception, they were all amazed at what they saw. Neatly written across the paper was the following simple inscription, "Violins on the left and cellos on the right." (train horn blaring) (tense orchestral music) My name is Eddie Fontaine, and this is my story. (tires screeching) - [Nick] Help us. - [Driver] Next time, piano man. You play, you pay. (Nick gasping) (tires squeal) (melancholic music) - [Eddie] That's Nick, my older brother. He was having a really rough time. But things weren't always so tough, you know. You see, in the beginning, he had it made. He was destined for greatness. (fast paced piano) He was born with the gift of music, and, man, he had the touch. A true child prodigy. Nobody could play the piano like Nick. Music just seemed to flow right from his fingers. Everything seemed to come natural to him. He had all the luck, all the luck in the world. Until that fateful day a few years ago, one year to the day after our parents died, the day he took me out to celebrate my birthday. The day both our lives changed forever. (crowd chattering) (pool balls thudding) - $200, pay up. - Ah. - Billy, Billy, not so fast, buddy. Hey, you've been hustled, man. - Ah, I won. - You've been hustled. (men yelling) (blows thudding) (glass shatters) - [Mr. Dee] You're dead, piano man. You're dead! You're fucking dead! (floor thuds) ( playful music) (ball rolling) (distant siren wailing) (tense music) (ball thumps) (tense classical music) (footsteps thumping) - [Eddie] The bloody initials on Nick's pool cue kept the judge and Sheriff Matlin smiling as they sent my brother away to prison for two long years. - Billy! Billy! You're dead! You're dead, piano man. You're fucking dead. (door slams) (dog barking) - Nick. Nick, get up! Nick! Get up, come on, you gotta come in the house. - Get in the house, man. - Come on. Come on. - Get in the house, Eddie. I don't need help! Go in the house, man, all right? - Nick, you need to come in the house. - I'm all right. I need a drink. (chuckles) - [Eddie] Nick was spending a lot of time lately trying to escape his recent past. For me, it was all a giant wake-up call. Music was my only ticket out. (thunder rumbling distantly) (dramatic classical music) (thunder rumbling) (dramatic classical music) (thunder rumbling) (dramatic classical music) (playful music) - Mariooch! - Nicky! - What you doing, man? - Ooh, what happened to your lip, man? - Ah, just a little mishap. - Just one shot, Nicky. - Yeah? - Yeah, I can't leave the bottle, you know, right? Linda's old man has been complaining about the tabs again. Not just yours, everybody's. It's been tough. - Oh yeah? Mario, things have been tough all over. - Holy wow. - Leave the bottle. - (chuckles) I'll leave bottle. I'll leave you two bottles. (Nick sighs) (Mario whistling) (cash register dings) (classical piano music) Just make sure the seats are as good as your brother says they are, all right? If they're past the second exit, I don't want 'em. You can't hear the cellos past the second exit. I mean, where's the point? Am I right, Nick? - Whoa, who's that? (lively jazzy music) - Why don't you stick around and listen? They're from across the river, Nick. Pretty damn good. See that guy she's talking to, the boyfriend? - Yeah. - He's the thick one. This guy, Nicky, he's insane, man. I mean, he uses all 88s, this guy. (scoffs) He's definitely got the touch. - The touch? The touch? How the hell would you know whether or not he had the touch? You still think cellos are center stage. - How would I? - Yeah! - Mario Fiaco, frontline tenor and distinguished graduate of St. Paul's choir. How would I know if a piano player's got the touch or not, is that what you're really. - Give it up, Mario. You're a hack! You're a hack, you'll always be a hack. You're a hack. - All right, look, so I ain't so gifted, all right? I can live with that. I mean, I got, I got my job, and I got my health, and I don't have to drink 'em away, either. It's guys like you, Nicky. (scoffs) It's guys like you and your brother, man, you guys got it tough. - Brother. He's lucky, he doesn't know what he's got. - [Mario] Oh, the kid, he knows, he just, he just don't let up. - [Nick] Yeah, he's got the gift, all right. He's got it. (soft classical music) (church bells tolling) - [Instructor] Class dismissed. (footsteps thumping) - [Sister Angelica] Yes, Eddie, what is it? - Uh, I wanted to talk to you about this thing. - About what? Speak up, young man. Is it your brother? - No, no, no, nothing like that. It's, it's about this. - You do know this is just an audition approval, don't you? You have a lot of work to do before this becomes a winning ticket. - Yeah, I-I realize that. - Do you also realize what winning this would mean? It means you could get out of here. You could see the world. - Yeah. - Look, Eddie, you have a gift. And now, like any other great artist, you have to recognize that. It's just like money. Either you control it or it controls you. Now, the same thing with talent. You have to take control, and you can rise above with the angels or you can fall from the sky and burn with it in hell like your brother. (sharp tense music) Eddie, I'm sorry. Eddie, I didn't mean to say that. Eddie, please, you know how I feel about your brother. Eddie, wait. (happy violin music) (tense music) (bow clatters) (footsteps thumping) - Eddie? Are you all right? - Oh, yeah, I'm fine, I just got a lot on my mind. - I heard what Sister Angelica said. She didn't mean it, about your brother and everything. - Yeah, well, it doesn't really matter, does it? I know he's a loser. - Don't talk like that about your brother, Eddie. - What are you doing here anyway? I'm trying to rehearse. What do you want from me? - (scoffs) I don't want anything from you. I thought maybe you'd want someone to talk to, that's all. I'm sorry if I'm bothering you. Go ahead, rehearse. Don't let me stop you. - Sara, wait. (jazzy music) (players chattering) - What's matter with you, man? You're up. Melvin, you're up. - Hey, come on, could've been worse. He could have tried both shots. (chuckles) Maybe you fellas ought to stick to darts or cards. (balls clatter) - Just as a hobby. - If I would've known you guys were beginners, I never would've started a back pocket game. (balls clatter) It's just not enjoyable to play for fun. I'd be happy to teach you fellas. (balls clattering) - For a reasonable price, of course. - [Both] Pay your dues or sing the blues. - Here you are, sir. - Telly, my darling. - Oh, buona sera. - [Carla] Drinks for two. - Sorry, darling. I have to see your ID. - Here you go. - Hm. Is that all you got? - Yeah, I'm new here. (chuckles softly) - Oh, sorry. Telly, this is Vicky. She's out here for the school year from Louisiana. - Nice to meet you. - This is Telly, he owns the place. - Hi, Telly, nice to meet you. - What year were you born, Vicky? All right, all right. (hand smacks) Nevermind. What's the use? (classical violin music) (Eddie exhales) - Wow, that was really good. I had no idea that you played the piano. - Well, it was my first instrument until I tried the cello. I just think strings are more. Uh, well, they just seemed to have more emotion to them. (upbeat jazzy music) - [Nick] Just hear me out for a sec. - We don't want to hear what you have to say. We just want our money, man. - You'll get your money, man. You'll get your money, even if I have to pay for it myself. I mean, come on, give me a break, the guy's sick. I mean, he's a cripple, what am I gonna do, break his legs for the money? - No, you'll just have to loan it to him then. - (scoffs softly) I was afraid you were gonna say that. - I think I know those two guys. I think I've seen them over at Jackson's. But don't tell Nicky that I've been there, I don't want him to know I've been hanging out at Jackson's. - So that's Nicky. That's the piano man. (Vicky giggles) - Okay, all right, j-just give me a second, I'll be right back, okay? Come on, man. - What? - We lost fair and square. You owe me money. - I'm not gonna do it. - What do you mean you're not gonna do it? What, do you expect me to pay your bet? - Yeah, I expect you to pay my bet, - Well, I'm not going to, - you got me into this, - give me the money! - so you do it. - What's the matter with you? - You knew I was sick, I wasn't gonna. - Who cares? You made a bet. - Deal with it. - Okay, look. Here's the deal, he doesn't have the money, but I'll cover him, all right? Do me a favor, all right? Here's the money. At least give me another chance. I mean, come on, d-don't make me look like a jerk in front of my girlfriend. One more game, double or nothing. Come on. - Okay, it's a deal. - Deal. - Deal. - Under one condition. - What's that? - He plays too. - Deal. Deal? - Deal. - Okay. You know what? For this game, I think I'll use my own cue. (playful music) - See, Vicky? I told you they were hustling those two idiots. (Vicky laughs) (playful music) (balls clashing) - Plays a lot better when he's not drunk, huh? What was that you said? Uh, "Pay your dues or sing the blues"? - You're good. - When he. (Vicky gasps) (both giggling) - Carla! - Hi! - You look beautiful. (kiss smacks) (Carla laughs) And you! You look beautiful! (hand smacks) - You don't look. - You know I look, that's why you dress the way you do. - This is my cousin Vicky from Louisiana. Say hi, Vicky. - Hello. - No, say it with your accent. Your accent, Vicky. - Well, hi there, Mr. Nick. How y'all doing tonight? - Ooh! (Carla laughs) - That's more like it. - The pleasure is mine. - Here you are, ladies. - Telly, put it on my tab and bring me a scotch. - You're so sweet when you're winning, honey. (kiss smacks) - There ain't no booze in here. Hey! How come there ain't no booze in this drink? - 'Cause I think you ain't old enough to drink, honey child. - What kind of hospitality y'all serving around here anyway? - You know what, Telly? She is correct. Now, I happen to know another bar, and I know the bartender very well, and he is far more accommodating. What do you say we take our money over there? Yes? Good. Telly, keep the change. (Carla sighs) - Dammit, Sara. Don't you see, Sara? (bells chiming) He's just like his brother. Certain things don't change, that's just the way it is. When you get older, you'll understand what I'm trying to tell you. - How old, Dad? As old as mom was before she left? - (grumbles) Don't bring your mother into this. This is completely different. - How? Like what happened when you. - Don't. Don't you say it. If you do, I'm not gonna hear you anyway. - Well, I'm not listening to you anymore either, Dad. - Well, you can tell me you're not listening, but I know damn well you can hear me, so don't make me repeat it. You stay away from this Eddie Fontaine. He's just gonna throw his life away, just the way his brother did. - Hey, Mario! - Come here, come here you. How're you doing? (kiss smacks) - Mariooch, I want you to meet Vicky, this is Carla's cousin from Louisiana. Say hello to Mario. - Oh, Vicky from Louisiana, how are you? - Hi, Mario! (giggles) - What can I get you guys? - Two Long Island iced teas, and, uh, gimme a whiskey, the whole bottle. Mario, - Yes? - I am on a winning streak. - Oh, Nicky, keep going, keep going. - Hey, Nicky. - What? - I want some. - You want some what? - Oh, come on, you know. I wanna get some. - No. - Come on! - No. No. No, no, no. - You got the money! Let's celebrate your big win tonight. - No. No. And besides, you got your cousin with you, come on. - Oh, forget about her. The only reason she's here is 'cause she's an embarrassment to her parents. So come on. Come on, honey. Let's just get some. - No. - And don't worry about her, she is never gonna know. - I haven't done this shit in months, and neither should you. - Fine! I'm outta here. - Carla, would you just. - Forget it! - Get your shit together? Come on. (woman singing) (Vicky shouts happily) Hey! Whoa.

What is it with your type of woman? - My type? - Yeah. Type, I mean, you know, is it a childhood thing? Did your old man smack around you and your mom so much you got to like it or think it was acceptable? I mean. Or does it turn you on? Is it a physical thing? - What would you know about a physical thing? - I've been around. - Oh yeah? - Yeah. - So you know about getting abused by someone you're supposed to care about? - Must I be so specific? - I get it. You wanna stick with the small talk, the round around. Well, you know, that's the point right there, nobody ever wants to get to the fucking point. - Well, hey, sometimes the point can be awfully sharp. - Oh, listen, Nick. Nick Fontaine. You know, I know all about you. I know about the pool hall and all the missed opportunities and. (Mary sighs) So you gave up the piano for a cue stick and a cheap one-night hustle. You know, I can deal with that. - Wanna know why I quit the piano? Hmm? I'll tell you. Everything everybody said, it's true. I was a gifted kid with the touch. I was living the fantasy. Then something happened, reality crept in. I was tired of being lied to. Better yet, I was tired of lying to myself, you know? Thinking I was gonna wake up one day and be happy. You know, "Hey, go for it, Nick!" "Hang in there, man, it'll happen." "Come on, Nick, hang in there." Well, I hung in there, till the rope choked the youth outta me, and then it was going for the rest of my life. And then something happened. You see, I thought it was the devil stepping in, but now I realize it was just plain fate. I mean, what else can you call three brick walls and a steel door for a home I didn't even ask for? (train whistling) - [Nick] Whoa, rain train is moving! - Come on, slow down! Why are you speeding? - Because we gotta get to the crossing, or else the shortcut won't be a shortcut. (thunder rumbling) (train horn blaring) (crossing bells clanging) (playful music) Whoo-hoo! (laughs) - Slow down. (screams) (playful piano music) - Whoo! (playful music) (crossing bells clanging) Yeah! - That was so close! - That was close! Freedom train is still on track, can you feel it? (thunder crashes) - Freedom train? What are you talking about? - Oh come on! I know you felt it. I saw you felt it. Why do you think they call it the freedom train? - I have no idea, but am I supposed to feel good by this, or are you trying to make me feel good by trying to get us killed? - What do you mean killed? Who's killed? I wasn't trying to get anybody killed. Well, I'm dead, are you dead? Hey, squeeze me. Squeeze me! Let me know if I'm killed. Come on! Squeeze me! - Ow! - All right, I'm alive! I thought I blew it there for a second. Hey, Mary, you're taking this all wrong. That's the freedom train. When I was a kid, I used to dream on getting onto that train and never getting off till the wheels stopped rolling. Yep. You know what I'm talking about. I saw that you felt it. - Felt what? - Come on, admit it. Your heart's pounding, right? Freedom train is fearless, baby. And the wheels, they ride on Rearden steel! And the tracks run in both directions. (thunder crashes) So I ask you, think about it. Who is John Gault anyway? (Mary laughs) - [Eddie] Like a lightning bolt, she was there. It was great to see Nick smiling again. Maybe his luck was finally changing. (melancholic music) (thunder crashes) - This was an important place when I was growing up. I'd come down here with the gang, you know, see who was chicken and who wasn't. (Mary laughs) That wasn't even an issue for me. Come on. - Where are you going? - I knew I wasn't chicken. That wasn't even something I had to worry about. Me, I didn't even have to take the test. - Oh, what test? - Oh, the test. Yeah, come here. Watch yourself. See, these trestles, they were different for me. They were different for a few of us. Like Louis Arnell. Went to college, the guy made his mark. (Nick chuckles lightly) Tommy Saplinski. The trestles were definitely different for Tommy Saplinski. The guy would howl when the train came over. (Mary chuckling) Train would go, he would. (imitates howling) (Mary laughing) Still howling now. He's a lawyer up in Stratton. (chuckles) Last time I saw the guy, he'd sprayed this black stuff on his head to cover his bald spot. He said he couldn't win a case without it. - What about you? (thunder crashes faintly) - Hey! That's just it, it wasn't about me. It was about all of us. See, we'd come down here around midnight, you know. When the full moon was casting its spell. We'd psych ourselves up in the car, right? Then when we got here, everybody would have second thoughts, except for me, of course. But then, in the distance, we hear this train whistle. (train whistles faintly) What was that timing with that? (Mary laughs) That to us, well that's the freedom train. You see, you hear that whistle, all the talk becomes real, becomes reality, and you gotta make your move. So the brave ones, you know, we'd shimmy on out this way, and we jump out on the railroad ties. And you see, you have to avoid the fifth tie, you have to jump before or after the fifth tie. And we'd hang until the train came over. - Are you crazy? - And if we didn't make it, we'd fall to certain death. (thunder crashing) - You guys were crazy. - You wanna give it a go? Mary, come on, the train's on the way. - I know! - Oh, don't tell me you're chicken. Don't tell me you're chicken, Mary. I mean, come on! Whoo hoo! Come on, Mary! Come on! What are you, chicken? Come on, don't be a chicken, go for it. - Will you get back here? - Come on, Mary. You can talk the talk, but can you walk the walk? You're just like everyone else. It's easy. You can point your fingers, slap your tongue, - You're crazy! - and think you know exactly what to say. But Mary, the book has no meaning unless it's read, and you can't feel the magic unless you listen to the music! Come on, Mary! (crossing bells clanging) Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Whoo hoo! Come on, Mary! Yeah! (Mary screaming) (train rumbling loudly) (rain pattering) (thunder rumbles) (gentle playful music) (drawer clattering) - Holy shit! (Vicky screams) - Who the hell are you? - Who am I? Who are you? (light clicks) - Eddie! A little wild, huh? That's cool. I can dig wild. Eddie, this is my friend Mary. Mary, this is my little brother Eddie. - Hi. - And you are, uh? - Vicky, Nicky! It's Vicky. - Hey, Vicky, you remember Nick. Don't you? Hell, it's only been a few hours since we were all together. Vicky and the two of us, that is. Hey, honey, what took you so long to get home? You know how lonely I get when it rains. - Eddie, don't you have a rehearsal or a performance tomorrow? What are you doing having a party the night before you have to play? Why don't you show these two nice, young ladies that you let in the way out? - Forget about it, Nick. Looks like you got a performance of your own going on. I know the way out as well as in. Come on, Vicky. (footsteps thumping) - What are you doing to me? - I didn't let them in. (melancholic choir music) (guests applauding) - Sister Angelica, students, let me introduce to you Dr. Yurgas Weisberg and pianist Kurtis Kuergorian. - Thank you, Sister. Young ladies and gentlemen, it is my pleasure to see that you not only have faces of angels but voices to match, and I look forward to your performance tomorrow. - Now, Sister Angelica, if you will excuse your class, the professor and I will step up to have a meeting with you. - Yes, Mother. (bell ringing) All right, class, don't forget about those ticket sales, and I expect to see you all tomorrow night. (church bell clanging) (students shouting distantly) - Eddie. - Yeah? - I just wanted to say thanks. - For what? I'm not carrying your books, am I? - I found the ticket. - Oh, that. Oh, well I didn't realize I was giving you two tickets, you know? What I wanted to do is ask you to go, but I guess, I don't know, I guess I didn't know how to ask you. - No, it was my fault. It's just, I sped out of there when I found out what time it was because I knew my dad was supposed to be there already. Can I call you after school? I wanna go, but, um. - You know, yeah, that's cool. Oh! (Vicky exclaims) Oh, I'm sorry. - Oh, that's all right. It was my fault. I just haven't gotten used to campus yet. You know what I mean, Eddie, being from down south and all. - You two know each other? - Well, we, we don't really. - Eddie and I sort of bumped into each other last night by accident. My head is still throbbing. It was quite a night for me. - Vicky, this is Sara, and Sara, this is Vicky. - Nice to meet you. - The pleasure's all mine, honey child. I'm sort of new here, and I need to get to know all the kids I can. - Oh, have you tried the preschool across the street? (bell ringing) - Is that the bell? Are we already late? My schedule is so confusing. - All right, you have gym class, which is. - Gym class. I know where gym class is, that one I know. - Oh, okay. - Hm, that's easy, that's where all the football players hang out. - None of which I bet you know on a personal basis. - Oh, well, you got me on that one. Anyway, we have to go, Eddie, because you know how Sister Angelica abhors tardiness. (Sara chuckles) - (chuckles) Right, tardiness. Uh, well, it was nice seeing you again. - Oh, the pleasure was all mine, Eddie. Thank you for your help. Us Southern girls have always counted on the kindness of strangers. (Eddie chuckles) - What? - [Sister Angelica] All right, class, let's turn to page 27, bar 23. (pages shuffling) ( gentle choir music) (door slams) (door banging) - Nick! Nick, open the door! (door banging) Nick, let me in, goddamn it! (door banging) - Carla, would you relax? It's open! (door slams) (feet stomping) (doors slamming) - All right, where is it? - What is it, Carla? Where is what? - Don't play dumb with me, Nick. I know your IQ, I've been reminded of it way too often. - I didn't know you were keeping score. - Just give it to me! It's mine! I paid for it this time. - Yeah? Did you pay for it this time with cash? - Fuck you, Nick! You got a lot of balls talking to me that way. Remember, you were the one last night sucking titty. I was here, remember? Practically caught you in the act. - If I recall, it was your cousin Vicky with my little brother, Carla. - You know, (door slams) I could give a shit about them. In fact, I'm happy for Vicky. It's you and that barroom slut that I'm having trouble with. What'd she do, sing you a lullaby last night after I left the bar? - Where do you come off coming in here and talking to me like this? I don't see a ring on my finger, do you? Do you see a ring? - Well, maybe that's just the trouble, Nick. - (laughs) Not gonna get me into that conversation again. - Look, just give me my stuff, Nick. I know that you have it. I left it in your bathroom last night, and I know you found it, so just give it to me! Just give it to me before I rearrange your furniture. You know I can do it, and you know I will. - I said no, but you just had to go find a sugar daddy, eh? You know, buy you some candy, make you feel good. Well, why don't you spend the night with him? You know, pay him for his time. 'Cause Carla, it's too late, it's already halfway to the Atlantic. - What? - I flushed it. - You asshole! (glass shatters) (both yelling) (things smashing) (Carla sobbing) I need it, it was mine! You selfish son of a bitch. (weeps) (church bells tolling) - Wait, wait, wait. What did I do? - You don't know? - No, I don't know. I mean, it's not like we're going out or anything. Oh, all right, I've noticed you looking at me. - I don't believe you. I've been looking at you? - Yeah. (Sara scoffs lightly) - All right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, I've been looking at you too. So what? - I like the way you put that. Tell me, Eddie, how much bubble gum can a girl chew at one time? - I don't know. - A lot. Or didn't you notice? Oh, that's right, you were too busy looking down her top. - Sara, you know what? I don't need this shit. I ask you out on one date, and you think we're married already. God, and I thought I was doing you a favor. - Doing me a favor? My father was right about you. You are just like your brother. - See? He said that. He said that, didn't he? See? I told you. I was right, your father don't even know me except for the other day, and already he's giving me the slow burn. You know, that's a bullshit grudge he's playing with. - It's no grudge, Eddie. Face it, manslaughter is a reality. Just try and ask the victim. - Hey, listen, me and my brother Nick were both in the wrong place at the wrong time. Anyway, Nick paid his debt to society. - It's an open-ended debt, Eddie! - We are close this time, Mary. I mean, we're close, a lot closer than when we were back in Phoenix. I mean, you just gotta believe in me. - Marty, I'm tired. I'm tired of hearing your stories, and I'm tired of playing the same old songs. What's gonna make it different this time, huh? - You just gotta believe in me a little bit longer, and I swear, I will take you with me all the way to the top. Look, girl, I know you're the one with the voice. I've believed in you all the way. So just try, okay? Just try and believe in me just a little bit longer, and I swear, I swear to you, I will make it happen for us. It's gonna happen so fast, your head's gonna spin around. And look at this. Got a little of this for right now. Cheer you up, make you feel better! (Marty chuckles) Come on, babe. You know you love this. Here you go. Come on. Mary. Come on. Well, look, I'll see you out there? - [Mary] Yeah, I'll see you out there. - Okay. (Mary sniffs deeply) - Mario, can we please get going? We're gonna miss the first number. - All right, all right, I'm coming, I'm coming. Look, you mess this up, Peter, and her old man is gonna kill me. And that just means that I'm gonna have to kill you. You got that? - Look, Mario, I'm doing you a favor. Now, do you want me to or not? - Okay, I-I'm sorry. It's just I can't forget the last time you did me a favor, Peter. It cost me over $2,000. - I told you, somebody put acid in my drink. - I know, I know, Peter, and even though I didn't go to Vietnam, I'm being affected by Agent Orange here! Just please, please, please hold the fort until I get back, all right? Now, you got my number. If there's a problem, beep me, okay? Beep me, Peter. - I'll beep you! - Beep me! - And don't forget the umbrellas in the tropical drinks, Peter, okay? - Jesus! C-can you believe this guy? Like he's the only one who works for a living. Shit, if my old man would've gave me this place instead of giving it to my sister, this'd be a real bar. Shit, Mario just got lucky. He married into it, you know. I mean, that, that's all that happened. You think it's easy to go out and get a job nowadays? I mean, it's tough all over, right, Nick? Here, this one's on the house. - You know, no thanks, Peter. I'm not thirsty tonight. (gentle music) (classical music) (melancholic music) (musicians chattering faintly) (lively piano music) - Nick. Nick! - (chuckles) Hey, Eddie, how you doing? - What are you doing here? - I'm just hanging out. - Hey, I got an extra ticket. You wanna go check it out? - No, man, tonight's your show. But go on, don't be late. (musicians chatting faintly) (audience chatting) (faint music) (footsteps thumping) (gentle music) (lively piano music) (lively classical music) (audience applauding) - Hey, what are you doing? Come on, hurry up! (melancholic music) (doors slamming) (dial tone ringing) (phone rings) (receiver smacks) (phone rings) (receiver smacks) (phone rings) (receiver smacks) (phone rings) (phone clatters) (melancholic music) - [TV Character] And I'm here to make sure everyone gets their fair share. - Come on, Eddie, tell me the joke. Please? - No, no. It, it's not even a joke, you probably wouldn't even get it. - I'd get it! Hell, just cause us Southern girls talk funny doesn't mean we're stupid. Come on, try me. Tell me what's so funny about the right side and the left side. Come on, try me! Go ahead! - All right. All right, all right. - I get more than you can imagine. - All right, all right. All right, there was this conductor, and every time he would step up, he would pull out a piece of paper and read it. - He reads it, a-and what does it say? - No, no. I'll get to that later. Anyway, the story goes on. - [TV Character] After all, (thunder crashes) it's just an illusion, right? - "Violins on the left and cellos on the right." You get it? (train whistle blares distantly) - Wait a minute, you hear that? Listen! You got a penny? - A penny? - Yeah, you got a penny? Come on, check your pockets, I need a penny. - Yeah, I think so. (coins clattering) - Come on! Come on. - Where are you going? - Let's find a place to put 'em on the track. - No. - Come on, come help me! Come on! - Vicky, I don't. - This'll be fun, come on! - No. I'm serious, I don't think you should go out there. - What's the matter? You chicken? (thunder crashes) (coins clinking) (train horn blaring) (train rumbling) - [TV Character] It's all in the eyes of the beholder. (Vicky laughing) - Did you see that? Did you see how close that was? Shit. (thunder crashes) (playful music) - I'm really sorry I didn't take you all the way home, Eddie. If it hadn't been raining, I really would have. My cousin Carla would kill me if I had ruined her car. - No, that's all right, really. I'll walk, I don't live far at all. - You can stay here! That's it. I'll give you a ride to school tomorrow. That's it. You could do that. It's all right, I'll give you a ride tomorrow morning. I'm sure my cousin Carla would let me borrow her car. You know, she's been so depressed recently after she's been fighting with your brother that she never even comes out of her room. Now, you wouldn't want me to get all depressed like your brother got her, would you? - Uh, didn't. Uh, didn't you say Carla was locked in her room? - Like I said, she's been in there for days. She's got that manic depressive thing or whatever. She never goes anywhere. Why don't you just focus in on me? Relax and take in this Southern hospitality. You see these pennies? This is for good luck. Here, take it. Maybe you'll just get lucky tonight. - [TV Character] The mind is a terrible thing to waste. Isn't that true, Doctor? (thunder crashes) (tense dramatic music) - Carla! Carla! Carla, honey, are you here? Oh, what a mess! (melancholic music) God, look at these pictures! (tense music) (water dripping) (clock ticking) (tense music) - [TV Character] Coming out after five years. Finally, success. Oh, it feels great. (laughs) Yes, I can't believe it's going. - [TV Character] Dr. Jekyll, Dr. Jekyll, are you there? (busy signal beeping) (door knocking) Dr. Jekyll, are you all right? (distant thump) - Listen, just stay here, wait for Carla to show up or call. If she shows up, call me, and if I see her, I'll call you, okay? - Okay. (knob rattles) (rain pattering) (tense dramatic music) (Eddie panting) - Come on, breathe! Breathe, come on! (Carla coughing) (thunder crashes) (thunder crashes) (gentle music) - It's all right, man, it's all right. She's in my bedroom sleeping it off. I got her on the steady. Everything's cool. - Oh, you got her on the steady now? Oh, that's great, Nick. - Not now, Eddie. - Why not? We all know each other. Once again, you're just in time. - Eddie, knock it off. - No, really, everything's fine, Nick. You know what you're doing. I'm cool. - You listen to me. Ever since Dad died and Mom checked out and all of that, I've been taking care of myself. Now, I don't need a nanny, and I'm not gonna take this shit, Eddie. - Nick, I told you, everything's cool. You know what you're doing. - Yeah, I do know what I'm doing. I know what I'm doing every minute of every goddamn day. You walk on broken glass long enough, you learn to walk with your head down. - Yeah? Well you should know 'cause you haven't lifted yours except for a stiff drink at Mario's for as long as I can remember. - What? How long can you remember, little brother? Can you remember 40 years? 'Cause I can. - Oh, don't even start that shit. Don't start that shit. No, you want? I don't remember. I don't remember, 'cause I'm too busy thinking about my future, and I haven't thrown it away like you, and I don't intend to. Not for you, not for a long pair of legs from Louisiana, not anybody, Nick. - You listen to me, you little ungrateful son of. - You listen to me, Nick! I'm tired of the promises and the lies! I just ran through the pouring rain from Carla's house. So I was with her bonehead cousin Vicky, who's lost in the fucking fog looking for answers. She said Carla was a little depressed lately. I think she used the word melancholy. Nice word for insanity, don't you think, Nick? - Man, what am I supposed to do? I can't keep Carla from doing what she wants to do. What's the matter with you? You know, I'm not her old man. You know the story, she just hooked onto me, and the rest is history. - Well you keep jumping on her grave, and you're both gonna be history. Nick, you know what I found in her house today? I found her sketches and paintings thrown all over the room, ripped and slashed, the eyes were cut out. She's a fucking loony, Nick. She had a suicide note written on her bathroom mirror in lipstick, and I guess she decided to come over here and recite it to you personally. (phone ringing) That must be Vicky now. I told her I'd call her the minute I found Carla. Listen, you talk to her. Tell her everything's fine, everything's business as usual, 'cause personally, I don't wanna explain nothing else to her. Nick, one more thing before I go. Don't try and help me no more, okay? Why don't you try and help yourself? 'Cause I'm getting out while there's still time. I'm not afraid to walk up to the plate. - That's good, I'm happy for you, Eddie, that's freaking great. Let me tell you something. Those pitches come really fast, and even the best of us can get hit by a curve ball. - Thank God for me the Russians aren't good at baseball. (melancholic music) (thunder rumbles) (melancholic music) (switch clicks) (TV buzzing) (switch clicks) - I'm leaving now, but before I go, I just want you to know one thing. I wanted you, Nick. I wanted you way more than you could ever imagine. I followed you. Yeah, I followed you until I got lost. I gave it all up for you, Nick! Every step. - Carla, don't, just hold on, don't you try and put this on me. Now, we are all responsible for our own lives. I never lied to you. I never told you I could give you anything that I couldn't. Now, I am sorry for you, but you have got to get yourself together. I spent two years in jail, and believe me, it changed everything. - Sure, Nicky. Everything changed, all right, but you see, it didn't matter. I loved you. - No, you never really loved me, and I never really loved you. Trust me, w-we were just at the same place at the same time. Christ, I was a shadow for you to box with till the sun went down. That's all, that's how it was. - Sure, Nicky, whatever you say. But look at me, Nicky. Look at me. My knees are bending, and I'm tapping on my wall. (sniffles) Goodbye, Nicky. - Don't do this to yourself, Carla. Carla! - [Carla] (sobs) No! (door slams) (note playing) - Nyet, nyet, nyet! (Kurt speaking Russian) - Wait a minute. Hush it. I'm the piano tuner here, Russian. If you think you can tune the piano, then you tune the piano, and I will play the piano. Okay, Russian? (Kurt laughs deprecatingly) - You will play. - Now go along on home. - You will play (speaks Russian). That's funny. - Go along on your merry way, Russian. (note playing) (classical piano music) (cane taps) (engine rumbling) (door thuds) (engine hums) (soft somber music) - Come on, Sara, talk to me. What do you want me to say? I'm sorry. - Nothing. (somber music) - [Announcer] Next up, Sara Matlin. - Oh my God, I can't believe they're calling me already. - You'll be fine, go. (somber music) (gentle classical music) - What'd you think, honestly? Was I okay? - You were brilliant. You'll definitely get a callback. (birds tweeting softly) (clock ticking) (water dripping) (playful violin music) (intense dramatic music) (sharp tense music) (deep dramatic music) (soft melancholy music) (footsteps thumping) (soft music) - I'm sorry, Eddie. - [Eddie] I blew it. I blacked out. - Don't think about it now. (soft romantic music) (cane thumping) (nun shouts) (sharp tense music) - This is God's home you are invading with your devil's reach. How dare you. Get out! Get out! (cane bangs) Get out, out! (thunder rumbling) (radio chatter) (tense music) (gentle piano music) - Hell, Mary, all this girl wanted to do was paint pictures. Then one day, Nicky comes along. This was before he whacked that bozo over the corner pocket and went to jail. Nicky had a straight job back then delivering bottled water. - (laughs) No way. - I swear to you, you believe this? Nicky? (Mary laughs) - He's got a delivery to this guy's house. He's hiking up the driveway, and he looks up upstairs window and sees Carla standing there, totally whacked out of her bird, nude. I mean, she's gonna jump. She's gonna jump and end it all. So Nick, Nick drops the bottle, man runs up to the front door, bangs on it, puts his fist through the fucking thing, makes his way upstairs and grabs her just as she's about to jump. She falls back in his arms, and Nick wraps her up in a blanket and takes her home to sleep it off. You know, I guess Nicky's been helping her sleep it off for a long time now, man. I guess this time she just didn't want to wake up. You like that story? You like that picture? That's what Carla was painting before Nicky found her, and now she's finished. (clears throat) How we doing, Gus? Good, it looks good, man. - Hey, Mario. - Would you look at me while I'm talking to you, please? Do you know that cousin of the woman who got killed? - Yes. - Yes, well, I had her come downtown and make a statement. And regardless of what you may think, it seems that Nick Fontaine may have had something to do with Carla's death. - (scoffs) I love it. Somehow you're gonna twist suicide into murder? (thunder crashes) - Hey. How you doing? - (exhales) I'm all right, how are you? - I don't know. Better for worse. Had my last fight with Marty anyway. - Really? - Of course, I still gotta deal with him as far as business goes. - Yeah, well, business is business. - [Mary] Yeah, and a hell of a lot of work. - You know what they say about work, don't you? - No, what? - When your work is work, you're in the wrong line of work. - Nick, I'm, uh, I'm so sorry about what happened with Carla. I don't know what to say, I'm just so sorry. - You know, it's amazing how she looked at me the last time I saw her, you know? I could see it in her eyes. I never should have let her go. - Why do you say that? - I don't know, maybe it's what I want to hear myself saying. I would have had to wake up with blood on my hands either way. The funny thing about death, it looms over us our whole lives, but when it comes to someone you know, it leaves a mark on you forever. - Nick, it's not your fault. You just gotta give it some time, and it'll pass. - Mary, I gave it all the time I could spare. Now, it's not just Carla, it's my whole life. When I used to compose, everything would fog over, you know? Literally. You know, I'd drift away, and I'd wake up in the middle of the song, I'd look down at the keyboard, I-I'd watch my hands dancing over the ivory. You know, and the only thing that would stop it was a rest between the notes, it was. Just seven notes, Mary. Just seven simple notes played a billion times. - Nick, slow down! - A billion different ways. - Just take it easy. - But. - It'll pass. (crickets chirping) (thunder rumbling) - Waiting. (ice clinking) You should look at all the time you've spent waiting. It would shock the hell out of you if you added it all up. - If you're waiting for Dad, it might be a while. - I came to see you, actually. I talked to your father already. - Great. - How's school? How's the violin coming? - The cello is fine. - You walk into a room, and you light it up with all your glowing innocence and your little girl charm. You and your just-right figure and your just-right hair (exhales) and your perfect little lips that don't take the time to say anything because you are too afraid that you won't say just the right thing. So instead, you slip open your thin legs, and you tuck your little man between them, and you slide your bow across his neck until he cries out in his soft, deep, sexy voice. And he does the talking for you, and oh God, he is so damn good! - You are disgusting, Mother. You're sick! - So they say. - Yeah, they do. You better just leave. Dad will be home soon, and you know he doesn't like you being here! (door knocking) Eddie! What are you doing here? - I need to talk to you. Is your father home? - No, he's not home. Come on inside. - Is that your mother? - Do me a favor, don't even ask. - I looked all over school for you today. I thought you got in trouble too. - I didn't go in today. What trouble are you talking about? - Oh, you didn't hear? - Hear what? - Well, it's all here in black and white, or should I say red? - What is this? - Well, I thought you got one too, but I guess I'm the only one who got qualified. Seems like my display at tryouts plus our little bell thing got me two strikes. And plus Nick and Carla, I guess guilt by association got me strike three. Anyway, I'm kicked out. - You're kicked out? - Yep, Mother Cierus, that bitch, she had it out for me since day one. - Well, she can't do this! There has to be a vote or something. What did Sister Angelica say? - Who cares? - I care, that's who. Did you talk to her? Did you even try? - Look, it's over, all right? Just like everything else. It's not about talent or hard work anymore. And I ain't got any, just like my brother Nick. - Well, isn't there anything we can do? Maybe your brother could talk to Sister Angelica or something. - (scoffs) Yeah, that'll be real good. We'll have Nick sleep with Sister Angelica for a favor. Nick's a loser. It started when we were kids, and he wind up in jail, and in the end, his girlfriend Carla killed herself. I warned Nick about Carla, and he didn't listen. So instead, he waited on line like everybody else waited on line. I knew this was gonna happen. I knew something like this was gonna happen. Well, fucking motherfucker, (fist banging) - Stop it, Eddie! - I knew this shit was. - Stop it, Eddie, stop it! You're gonna break your wrist! What is the matter with you? (playful music) (men whispering) (dial tone humming) (keys beeping) Just because you play the violin great doesn't give you the right to throw your life away. I am tired of looking out. - I don't wanna hear it. - For everyone else. (sighs) You better just leave. I don't need another runaway in my life. (latch clicks) (door slams) (Sara crying) (jazzy music) (phone ringing) - (groans) Man, what the hell? Hello? - Hey, Nick. Mr. Dee, he's here. He's here. - Are you sure it's him? - Yes, I'm sure, Nick. Yes, I'm sure. I'm sure as Spin is in a wheelchair. Yes, he's here, he just got in. I don't know. I don't know, but, b-but I tell you, I'm, I'm sure it wasn't for good behavior. - I want you to go see Fisheye, he's gonna give you a package. And I want you take that package, put it with all the money you can get and put it in our special stash, all right? Now listen, don't wait there for me 'cause I may not get there till late. Go to Spinner, tell him I said I need his stash. He'll complain at first, but he'll come through. Look, I-I never wanted to talk about this, but I think this is the time. Look, and I know what it takes to hold back your cards, man, and I just want you to know I appreciate you, all right? Bye. - Shit. I finally save up enough money to get laid, and I gotta give to the goddamn guy I won it from. Here, it's not gonna get him far. Hey, if you keep staring at him, he's gonna come over here and ask you if need a goddamn ride. Now get the hell outta here. - Oh shit. (stammers) He's coming over here. Oh fuck. Oh shit. - Now's your chance, get the hell outta here. - Okay. - You're kidding me. Really? Uh, yeah, all right. You know, all right, all right, bye. You know, nobody tells me shit anymore. I mean, I cannot believe they let this fucking monster outta prison. I thought he was doing like 500 years or something. Yo, Marty, where the hell's Mary? Is she here yet? - Mary who? - Whoa! (hands slapping) Whoa, is it me, or did I hire an entire band here and not just a duo? - No, she'll be here, don't, don't worry about it. - No, no. She has my truck, that allows me to worry about things, you understand? She better be here and soon. (engine rumbling) (melancholic music) - Listen, Mary, um. Look, thanks a lot. I just gotta take care of this last thing before I split. - Yeah, sure. You don't wanna leave anybody hanging, I can understand that. - Look, Mary, I'm sorry. You know, this thing goes way back. It's just a matter of time before this guy catches up with me, you know? You got a good thing going with the band. - Look, uh, I said I understood, Nick. You just take care of yourself, that's all, okay? (door slams) (engine rumbling) - You were so close, Nick. - Yeah, well, there were just some crossroads along the way, and I just had to check them out, that's all. Hell, and besides, I-I like playing pool better than I like playing the piano. - (chuckles) I could never figure that out. Why pool? - Why the piano? (thunder crashes) Well, I don't know. First, maybe I just wanted to make my own choice, you know? I mean, piano, when I was a kid, it was a gift. I didn't even think twice about it. But pool, that was something I could choose. You know? That was my game. You know, when I first started playing the piano, you know, w-when I first realized that I was different, when, uh, when I realized what the touch was and that I actually had it, (chuckles) I used to think I was, I was special. You know, I thought the touch was reserved just for a few, for, for the lucky ones. You know what I'm talking about, like the Mozarts, you know, people that could lick the envelope and seal it before they died, you know? But then after a while, I realized there were others, and they just were unlucky. You know, like the people who painted pictures that no one ever saw or the ones that wrote the words that no one ever took the time to read. I'm talking about Carla and Mario and half the musicians who play dives like The Music Box night after night. These people live on a dream that may never come true. Well, I started to think about that a lot, and it was scary. You know, I mean, w-was I gonna be one of the lucky ones or was I living somebody else's dream? And I was a kid, (thunder rumbling) I was getting shoved here and pushed there. I was promised everything by a bunch of nobodies. I was getting nothing from everybody. (chuckles) My old man. They say it's lonely at the top. Well, I experienced that. They say it's lonely at the bottom, I experienced that too. One day, I'm popping a cork out of a bottle of champagne with my father. Before I know it, I'm scraping up change for a pint of beer. It's what you do in between that's the tough part. And all the time, I didn't have a choice. And besides, it just, it just got so easy, you know? I mean, i-it got to the point where I, I could hear a song, bang, I could bang it out in a minute. I wanted to write, I just put my fingers down on the ivory, boom, it was done. The challenge was gone. What was left for me was fear. It was the fear of my future, it was the fear of the unknown. One day, (chuckles) by accident, I wandered into this pool hall, you know, and I-I just wanted an escape, but, uh, but I got lucky. I could feel it right away, you know? I mean, you know, it's like I touched the felt on the table, I put the chalk on my hands, I could smell it. There's no long-term fear in a pool hall. You know what I'm saying? You know, anything can happen at any time. W-when you're at the table, you know, and your elbows are on the felt, and you're looking down the cue like it's the barrel of a high-powered rifle. Your brain's making out geometric angles and spin patterns for every ball. You cock back the cue, and that's the time, that's the time minutes don't count and seconds don't add up because you're living for the moment. Boom! You take the shot. It's either in or it's out. You win or you lose. And besides that, no matter how good you are, and I am pretty goddamn good, you still gotta deal with the people across the table 'cause they could beat you at any time, no matter how good you are. And that's something every pool player has to deal with. So I used to have my piano, now I have my cue. Difference is when you're playing a game of pool, the bullshit and the uncertainty ends at the end of the game when you look up at the score. - I guess maybe you're right. Maybe it's not the game you're playing, maybe it's just the people you play it with. (thunder rumbling) I guess that's why I'm here. People are my crossroads, this is my pool hall. - Well, Eddie is at that crossroads, Sister. And please, promise me you're gonna help him, he needs you. - And what do you need? - (laughs) Me? I don't need anything. I just need time and some chalk. - It's really easy to lose track of time. It's even harder to find it. Where are you gonna look? - Everywhere but at a clock. (chuckles) And that reminds me, do me a favor, (Nick sighs) give this to Eddie when you think the time is right, okay? - And how am I gonna know when that is? - You'll know. - Look, Nick, it's too late. He's already been expelled from the auditions. He's not gonna get another chance. - Jesus Christ, Sister, have a little faith. Come on, promise me you're gonna help him. You told him yourself, anything can happen with a little love and a little faith. And what is love but the morning sun and the twinkle of the evening stars? (train rumbling) - I mean, screw Mary. I mean, she's just tits and ass for this band. You know it, and I know it. (jazzy music) (door slams) I mean, let's face it, guys, we're trying to make a living here, right? I mean, screw her and her, what, art shit. (Marty groans) I mean, we know what sells, right? - Whatever you say, Marty. - Jimmy. - I don't know, man. - Jimmy. Jimmy. Come on, Jimmy. I'll tell you what, for you, I'll keep in a couple of her originals, for now. But once we start making some real money, we phase them out. (Marty puffs) She won't even notice. - You think she's that stupid? - Yeah, I think she's that stupid. (rain pattering) (thunder rumbling) - Yes, Mother, but I really. - Please, Sister. I have given you every opportunity to state your case, and I'm sure that you have used it wisely and well and that you are now ready to receive my rebuttal. Fair enough? (rain pattering) (thunder rumbling) (brakes squeak) (rain pouring) - Who's there? - Hey, Joey. What are you doing out here, Joey? You seen Nick? Hey, you're looking good. Joey, how you doing, buddy? Good to see you. Hey, you're looking good. What are you doing out here, Joey? - N-nothing, I-I'm just, I'm, you know, I'm, I'm, I'm picking up some stuff. - You're picking stuff up? - Stuff, yeah. I just came down to pick up some stuff. - Hell of a night to be picking up some stuff. - (stammering) I just, you know, I-I-I. - Joey. You seen Nick, Joey? Seen Nick? - Uh, n-no, no. No, I swear. - I heard you calling him, Joey. - (stammers) N-no, I swear to God, I haven't seen, - No, no? - I haven't seen him. - You're gonna take me to him, man. (Joey stammering) You're gonna take me to him, Dee, I don't know where. - Or you're gonna be dead in this trestle! (blow thuds) (Joey shouts) (engine rumbling) (wipers thumping) Talk to me, junk man. I heard you, talk to me. Now, you talk to me, buddy. Where is he, junk man? I followed you from that corner pocket, and I followed you all over town! I followed you to that car lot, and I'm tired of you leading me in circles! Now where is he? Now get up. Get up, man. Get up. What's the matter, Joey? You're having a hard time walking? Come here, I'll help you, Joey. (blow thuds) (Joey groans) I didn't mind you as a spectator. (blow thuds) (tense music) But when you started to lend a helping hand. (blow thuds) (Joey groaning) That wasn't fair. 'Cause we both know that Nick Fontaine could never have taken out my brother on his own! (thunder crashing) - Nick? Come on, get in, I'll give you a ride. (train horn honks) (train rumbling) I'm heading over to your house anyway. I've got to talk to Eddie. - Thanks, but I'm not going home. Uh, do me a favor, before you turn on Main, just drop me off on the railroad tracks, I'll walk the rest of the way. - Where are you going? - I'm leaving town for a while. - Does Eddie know you're going? - No, but I'll, uh, I'll contact him in a few days. (thunder crashes) - You gonna tell me what's going on? (train rumbling) - You know why I'm going over to see Eddie? Because I made a mistake. And you're making a mistake too if you leave town. (door slams) (engine rumbling) (car thuds) (Joey groaning) - Oh my God! Joey! - What is that? What is that? Stop the truck. - Are you okay? What happened? Talk to me. Can you talk? - What happened? What happened? - I don't know! I was just with Nick, and I-I dropped him off. I-I started to pull away, I thought I hit him. - You were with Nick? Where'd you see him go? Where? - I don't know. He went down the tracks, and he had a duffle bag, He said he was going out of town, and he said that Joey would tell you where he was going. - Nicky, Mr. Dee's gonna kill him. - What? - What? - Mr. Dee's gonna kill Nicky. You gotta get Nicky. (coughs) Nicky, somebody's gonna go get Nicky. Mr. Dee's gonna kill Nicky, he's gonna kill him. He said he was gonna kill him. What are you talking about, Joe? - I should have told you. I should have said something to you. I know that you didn't, you didn't mean to do it. You blacked out. Your brother said not to say anything to you. - What do you mean? What do you mean? - That night, don't you remember? (cue whacks) The cue stick. You killed that guy. (cue whacking) You killed that guy. You hit that guy, Eddie. You were crazy. Your eyes, you should have seen it. (eerie music) Nicky said that you didn't know what you were doing. (cue clacking) (eerie music) Make sure, make sure Mr. Dee doesn't kill him. Eddie, make sure he doesn't die twice for you. Make sure your brother doesn't die twice for you. - I have to go find Nick before he leaves. (thunder rumbles) - Nick, what are you doing? Nick, what are you doing? Were you just gonna leave like that? No, no goodbye, no nothing? Nick, don't be an asshole, talk to me, man. - What is it to you? Huh, Eddie? Huh? What is it to you? Huh? You see this? You see this? Everything I got in my life fits in this little bag and this thin case. I am finally getting outta here. I'm getting on the freedom train, and this time, nothing is gonna stop me. Not you, not Mary, not prison, nothing! - Nick, I understand, Nick. I know! I know, I hate the bullshit too. Mary told me everything, Nick. I know about Joey. - What happened to Joey? - Well, Mr. Dee beat him up really bad. He was looking for you, Nick. He kept his mouth closed for you. - Son of a bitch. Did Joey have a bag or a box or anything with him when you found him? - No. - Good, he stashed it. I'm gonna get it, and I'm gonna - Nick, come on! - fucking blow Mr. Dee away - Nick, come with me. - if he so much - Nick, I'll get you - as comes near me. - a plane ticket, man. Nick! - [Nick] Will you just leave me alone? - Come on, Nick, please. Nick, I'll get you a plane ticket, Nick, I got money. Nick, I know about the pool hall. I know I hit him and you took the rap. (melancholic music) - Yeah, Eddie. Yeah, I took the rap. You see, though, don't get confused. Your brother's not a hero. You see, I'm a coward. See, I always knew I didn't have what it takes to go the ride, but uh, I thought you might. So you want to help me, you want to pay me back? Just promise me you're gonna make it, man. Just promise me you won't let me down 'cause you got a long ride ahead of you. And with a gift like yours, you can't afford to let it go like I did with mine. You understand? You promise me you're not gonna let me down, 'cause I'm gonna be thinking about you every time I hear a melody that makes me cry or a song that tells the truth or anytime I lose my way or anytime I meet somebody who knows exactly what they want outta life and will do anything they can to get it. It's easy, man. All you gotta do is go up to the plate and take your best shot. Y-you may strike out, you may even lose the game, but at least you're gonna be a player. Now look at me and promise me you're not gonna let me down! - All right, Nick. I won't let you down. (thunder rumbling) (melancholic music) - Remember, violins on the left and cellos to the right. (thunder crashes) (melancholic music) - [Eddie] As it turned out, thanks to Nick, Sister Angelica got me another audition. (happy music) When I walked up to the plate, I felt Nick was there with me as I read his final reminder. (lively classical music) That time up, I hit a home run. Six weeks later, I was touring the world with the Moscow Symphony Orchestra, and man, it was great. I couldn't wait for Sara to come and join me for my performance in Rome, the most romantic city in the world. As for Nick, he finally took that ride on the freedom train, and get this, he started to play the piano again with someone who really cared. Everyone has a turning point in their life. That was mine. I don't know if I ever could fully repay Nick for what he did, but I do know that every time I play my music, I try.
