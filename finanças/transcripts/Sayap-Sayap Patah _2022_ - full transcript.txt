When someone doesn't prevent something evil, it means they support it. Oh, Dad, but what can I do to help? Relax, my child. You'll understand one day. Let me fight the evil for now. I want to be like you, Dad. If you want to be like me, study hard, don't skip school, love your mother, and don't buy snacks too often. But I love veggie fritters, Dad. Okay, I'll buy you veggie fritters. Dad, what was that sound? I'm scared. Relax, my kid. I'll protect you from the white wolf. Noisy. You're even prettier when pregnant. How about you keep being pregnant? Nonsense. You should get the morning sickness for me. No way. I prefer having the cravings. -Cravings for what? -For you. I'm not like you who craves fritters. I'm going to the doctor today for a checkup. Can you accompany me this time? I think I can. What time will it be? It's okay if you can't. If there are any issues, I'll let you know. Kun? Are you calm? Of course, Wan. We've done this several times. Aren't you calm? I am… But? I can't stop thinking about my kid. She starts school soon? She does. She's in a cute phase. But I'm curious about your wife. Ratih? I mean, doesn't she ever angry or worry about you? My wife's angry all the time. She's calmer than me. Really? Such a great wife. My wife needs to learn from your wife. Hey, what about him? Aryo? He's such a junior. Okay. -What time will he come out? -In half an hour. -The situation's clear? -Clear, Commander. Ridwan, Kuntadi, stand guard on the uphill road. -You, at the junction. -Yes, sir. Aryo will guard the exit. -Tell me when it starts. -Yes, sir. Stop and raise your hands! Don't move! Spread your legs. -Clear. -Clear. The bag's clear. EAST JAVA PROVINCE, SURABAYA CITY Murod, do you know why we're detaining you? Involvement in Leong's new member recruitment. Charity box theft in East Surabaya. Use of terrorism funds. Involvement in the assembly of the Puri Ratu Hotel bomb. Death toll of 25. Is that correct? You can speak in Jakarta. Mrs. Nani Sudarmaji? Please, come in. I'm nauseous and I feel pain here. Is the pain in the lower abdomen? That's right. Did you do any excessive activity? No. I did normal activities. Let's have a check. You have preeclampsia. Your blood pressure's very high, and that's accompanied by abdominal pain. This will be risky for your pregnancy and the baby if you're not careful. What should I do? Don't think too much. Don't get stressed. It'll help you during this pregnancy. Peace be upon you. Peace be upon you too. How was it? Sorry I couldn't accompany you. What did the doctor say? Everything's okay? It is. Thank God. I thought something bad had happened. But you have no pain and nausea anymore? No. I'd like to ask Mbak War to stay with me here. Who's Mbak War? Our neighbor. She used to work with a midwife. Why don't you ask your mother instead? It's tiring for her. Okay. But I'd like to meet her first. I don't know her yet. When will you have the time? Hello? Yes, sir. Is that so? Okay. Yes, sir. I'm leaving, okay? Yes? Please, come in. How's your work? Good. Have a seat, please. Wait a minute, please. Here's the remote. The vest? Here. Is it connected yet? Not yet. I haven't put the batteries yet. Put it on. You. Come here. Who are you? Her name's Desi. She's an orphan. She's my niece. She's still a kid. Are you married? Not yet. Syid. You've learned that our goal is heaven. The noblest goal. And my duty here is to help you to reach that goal. I WON'T BE LONG AT THE OFFICE. LET'S GO TO BUNGKUL PARK LATER. LOVE, AJI POLICE Any information about the empty house? I got it. Do you want me to give it to you? -Okay. -Yes, sir. According to intel, there is only a teenage girl in the house. -Status clear? -It's still being checked. But Aryo understands it the best. -All good, Yo? -All good, sir. Aryo never focuses when it's about women. What about Erlina? EAST JAVA POLICE DEPARTMENT -Let's go help them. -Okay. He needed to read it. -Ji. -Hello. How are you? Welcome to Surabaya. -Hi, miss. How are you? -Good, Ji. -May I help you? -You may. Thanks. Kun. Help process Miss Gendis' document. -How's Surabaya, Ji? -Hot. Nani likes it here? She's complained that she feels hot since she's heavily pregnant. -How far along is she? -Seven months. That's big. You should move to Jakarta. I'd love to, but it's not up to me. Easy-peasy. Help him. Give a recommendation. I can do that. But there are still seven more suspects. You can handle it. Every case we've had, my junior Aji could handle it. -"Junior"? -He was my senior, miss. His class was the worst. They're dizzying. He and Hendro were the best. Hendro is in Mako now. -What's his division now? -The event division. That's bad! -I bet he examined your work back then. -He did. I'm leaving, okay? Miss. Please investigate something for me. I have a guy inside, but we can't find him. -Who is he? -Sigap. Okay. Thanks. -Pay a visit to my house. -For sure. -We'll be waiting. -Okay. -Send my love to Nani, okay? -Okay. Thanks. Aji? Are you at the office? Ruslan and Gendis were here from Jakarta. They sent you their love. Gendis asked us to pay a visit to her house. You promised to take my call at the office. I just want to say that your origami is adorable. Really? I made it early in the morning. Can I help you, miss? Aji? Aji? Aji! Ruslan. Hello? Yes, sir. What do we do? We continue. There was an explosion at the Surabaya Police Headquarters. It was a suicide bomber. The explosion occurred at the building entrance. It is reported that the perpetrator was a woman. The victims are family… Aji? Oh, God! Three civilians are reported dead. -Three police also died. -Okay. I'm going to wait for you here at home. Okay. Aji. Plan one is done. We're already halfway in our fight. But something's still bothering me. I'm worried about this kid. I think he needs some reassurance to continue our fight. Give him to me. I'll make him assured. That's what I mean. Where is he? Syid? Rosyid? -Yes? -This is Mr. Abu. Abu Toyib. He's my best friend. Go with him. Don't contact me for now. Rosyid, pack your things. We need to move soon. NANI, MY LOVE, I MADE YOU YOUR FAVORITE FRIED RICE. WAIT FOR ME TO COME HOME! Hello? Yes. The CCTV files have been sent to your phone. Dul. Who was the guy followed by Kuntadi and Ridwan? Rosyid? A new recruit? Connected to Leong? Who was the woman? Niece? Whose niece? Rosyid's niece? MOBILE BRIGADE CORPS HEADQUARTERS, DEPOK -Excuse me, Commander. -Come in. Hey! Return me to my cell! He's so noisy. Open it. Why did you shout? -Seno, remove his blindfold. -Yes, sir. Until when? A long time? A long time for what? That I'll be here. Return me to my cell. Here is better. The cell is small. Here is spacious. Have I been moved here permanently? No. But you'll stay here for now. I've been here doing nothing. And what are you going to do in the cell? It's the same, isn't it? You do nothing there anyway. Take a seat. Sit down. If you're not gonna sit, I'm gonna go out. Ask Ari to bring us fritters and tea. Yes, sir. Sitting is more comfortable. Standing is exhausting. You don't need to shout. You're pissed off, so you make others pissed off too. -Here. Put it here. -Here, Commander. Fritters and tea. I had fritters and warm sweet tea brought for you. I'm moving your handcuffs to the front, so you can eat. -I'm going to go out. -Yes. You can drink this and eat this. Do you know him? No. What about her? No, sir. -What time is the football match? -Soon. If you don't know, I better go home. I better go home and watch football. Sir? Where are you going? I'm going to watch football. Liverpool's playing. You stay here. -Bye, Sen. -Okay, sir. -How was it? -Hey. Let him be for a while. Let him get tired. -Ignore him, Dis. -Yes, sir. -You took him from Surabaya? -Ruslan and I. Ruslan still owes me Padang rice. -How can you still remember that? -How's Aji doing? Members of Aji's squad became victims of the bombing. Ridwan and Kuntadi. Ridwan used to be posted with me in Pangkal Pinang. I remember his wife loved to make brownies. Excuse me, sir. Aji said that information from Murod is important for their movement in Surabaya. I hope we can get it from him. OUR CONDOLENCES FOR THE DEATH OF INSPECTOR RIDWAN -Peace be upon you, sir. -Peace be upon you too. Please go in. She's inside. Ratih. I thought I was ready. I thought I was ready. I thought I was ready. It hurts. Hey, kid! Don't play with firecrackers here! Play with them somewhere else! It's too noisy! Oh my God! Don't play with firecrackers in front of my house! What were you doing?! Please be patient, honey. Is that all you can say to me? What else do you want me to say? I don't know. I'm not trained in how to deal with this kind of situation like you are. Trained? -You know this is the risk… -The risk of your job. I know that. But I also don't know. That's the problem. What do you mean? I'm confused. You're confused? Or you don't understand? You don't understand. You don't know how it feels to be a wife who doesn't know whether her husband is safe or not out there! I cook for you every day, but I don't know whether you'll eat it or not. I don't know what I need to prepare for you. A blanket or a burial shroud? I've made up my mind. I'm going back to Jakarta. I'm going to have my baby in Jakarta. You can come and see your child when you have the time. What are you talking about? Why are you making a decision without even discussing it first? -What are you going to Jakarta for? -What am I here for? For me! For our child! How do I make sure you and our child are going to be okay in Jakarta? Who says we're going to be okay here? What are you talking about? Nani, you can tell me everything. Let me tell you something. The doctor told me I have preeclampsia. My blood pressure's too high. I may lose my baby. I can't be stressed. I can't be tired. You said you were fine. You lied to me. How could you lie to me in this situation? Your breakfast is on the table. Don't forget to eat it before you go to work. I've also put some dishes in the fridge. You just need to reheat them. My taxi's waiting outside. I'll let you know when I arrive at my mother's. Peace be upon you. Peace be upon you too. -Mom. -Nani! You're finally here. Here you are, my grandchild. Are you by yourself? I don't want to trouble Aji to take me here. Let him be. Come in. I've cooked for you. -What have you cooked? -I've cooked lodeh. Is this the place? So, Jamal… do not have doubts in your heart. Because your sacrifice means so much to us. Answer me. It involves the people you love. -Yes? -Ji… Confirmed. Yes, sir. Police! Put your hands up! Lie down! Lie down! Lie down! Lie down! Get up! Freeze! Stop there! Don't move! Put your hands up! Commander? Seno is still in critical condition. There's another piece of news. Sigap's dead body has been found. -Good night, sir. -This way. LAMPUNG PROVINCE, BANDAR LAMPUNG CITY -Man of the hour. -Sir. -Are you good? -Good, sir. You're skinnier. You haven't got any food? -Ready to go, sir. -Go in. -Is it healed yet? -It is, sir. -The journey was good? -It was, sir. -Rosyid, isn't he? -Rosyid. Rosyid, 23 years old. Highest level of education, junior high school. Wait, you didn't attend high school? My son is about your age. Didn't you want to attend high school? -I wanted to. -Why didn't you, then? My uncle told me to work first and study later. Uncle? Where's your father? He died. An accident, last year. Take it off. Rosyid. We know about Leong. About his movement, who he is, and his plan. The bombing the other day was his plan, wasn't it? You were instructed by him and you did it. So, I want you to tell us everything so we can solve the problem. Or do you want to eat first? We have soto. Noodles. Burgers. Why is he crying? Hey… Sir. Don't cry. Shush. I just want you to give us information to help us solve this problem. Okay? Can you? -Peace be upon you. -Peace be upon you too. Ji. -When did you arrive? -This morning. -Is Nani here? -She's inside. Come in. Why didn't you tell me you were coming to Jakarta? For work? How long will you be here? I can't be long here. Have you heard the news about Leong's arrest? I have. Thank God. -Hi. -Hello, honey. So exhausting, especially with this big belly. BABY PLAYARD ASSEMBLY MANUAL The wolf who wants to kidnap the baby bear runs into the woods. Papa bear looks for him in the wood, but he doesn't find him. He asks the trees, the wind, and the river, to help him find the wolf. -Is this the white wolf? -This is the bear. -This is the wolf -This one? What's white about it? I couldn't find a white one at the shop. Is Mom here? -No? -No. So, what now? What are you talking about? You're in my territory now, Mr. Leong. You can't do anything anymore. I know that your fight is fictitious. It's useless for anyone. Even for your men. It's only for your own advantage. It's fictitious for you. It's a reality for me. A trivial matter for you can be my everything. This is my way. This is my choice. What can you do about it? Oh, that's why. Your choice is like a kid's. If you aren't allowed to buy a snack, you get mad. If you don't get the toy you want, you sulk. If you're not taken for a walk, you roll around. -Enough! -If you never get attention… you look for it anywhere. Enough! What are you? -A kid! -Enough! Damn it! What do you want now? This is my choice. And this is my territory. -Let's see later. -I'll wait for you. Have you sliced the tomato? -Not like that. -Like what, then? Look. -I see. -Then slice into three parts. In cubes! I forgot. -Okay. Okay. -Okay? Rib soup. This was the dish I missed the most. Poor Aji. Next time, tell me if you want it and I'll send it to Surabaya. You don't need to send it to Surabaya. I'm reassigned to Jakarta. Aji! Are you serious? Mom! What is it, Ji? Mom. Her water's broken. Let's take her to the hospital. I've talked to the doctor. The doctor predicts it'll be in 12-20 hours. So, you still have a lot of time. It's not gonna be long. Yes, sir. Sorry, I can't go to the office. I'm at the hospital. My wife's about to give birth. Her water broke. Yes, sir. I'm asking for your permission. Thanks so much. Yes, sir. Thank you. Just go to the headquarters. Just go. This is your first day of work. No. I prefer to be here. I want to make sure everything's good for you. We still have another 12 hours. I have already gotten permission. Do you know? It turns out there's a fritter vendor in front of the headquarters. -How do you know? -Someone told me. Who? -You're making this up. -There is. Buy me fritters. Please. You go to the office for a moment, buy me fritters, and then come back here. Please. -Do you really want them? -I do. Fritters. Are you gonna be okay? I'll go to the office for a moment, make a report, and then I'm going to buy you fritters. If anything happens, ask Mom to call me, okay? For sure. Fritters. Do you want to drink? No. Thank you. -Good afternoon. -Good afternoon. The Surabayan has arrived. Hello. How are you? Just relax. Isn't this your first day here? If you want to, accompany me and Gendis to interrogate Murod today. -Since you were the one who caught him. -Yes, sir. We're going to dig up info about Sigap. Yes, sir. But I can't be long. I have to… -You're finally here. -Yes, miss. How are you? I'm fine. I'm going to move Rosyid to another cell. Is he starting to be more cooperative? Okay. Join us later. -I'm going to take Murod out. -Okay. Come on. -I hope you love it here. -Yes, miss. Ji, take this to Mr. Adi. Yes, sir. Mr. Adi, right? -Hello. -Aji. -What's this? -Padang rice from Ruslan. I've been waiting for this. Let's eat together. -Please, you eat it. -You won't eat? -Later. -I'll eat later too then. -How's… -Excuse me. They're waiting for you in the next building. -I'll go there. -Yes, sir. Ji, how's Nani? Nani's doing good, thank God. She's in the hospital. She's going to give birth. -Your first baby? -That's right. So, what are you doing here? I'm going to the office for a moment. I still have another 12 hours. Don't do this. This is a crucial moment for Nani. You know how our work is. Do people back home know? Nobody knows when you're going to come or go. Yes, sir. Ji, I'm amazed by you. But for this matter, this is a matter of life and death. -Yes, sir. -Nani needs you. Because things can change every second. Yes, sir. Have a little discretion. Yes, sir. Nani left me in Surabaya. See? -That's it. -Lack of time together. She said lack of attention. I couldn't give her a lot of my time. You have to prioritize Nani and make time for her. Yes, sir. She needs you, Ji. -Congrats on your first child. -Thanks, sir. -Go to Nani now. -I'm leaving, sir. -Thanks for bringing me the Padang rice. -Yes, sir. HONEY, I'M COMING SOON… HONEY, I'M COMING SOON TO THE HOSPITAL. I'LL BRING YOU FRITTERS. -Ji, why are you still here? -Yes, sir. -Hurry! -Yes, sir. -I'm going, okay? -Yes. Hey! Yes, sir… Hey, you at the front! Please check if my package has arrived! Is there any package today? Hey! -Package. -Hang on. I'm going to check it. Let me hold him. Rosyid, you're safe here. -La Umane. -Yes, ma'am? -Take care of Rosyid. -Yes, ma'am. Guard him. Okay, ma'am. Thanks. -Friends. -Yes, ma'am? -Take care of Rosyid. -Okay, ma'am. You're safe here. Okay? Don't think about it. Miss Gendis is a nice woman. She helped me. Other prisoners beat me up. Thank God she saved me. If it wasn't for her, I don't know how I'd be right now. Why were you beat up? They said my faith wasn't strong enough because I said I regretted joining my group in Poso. Who knows the level of someone's faith? Are they God? That's the thing. I don't know how they knew, or if they were just messing around. Maybe they saw my ugly face and felt I was a good target. La Umane. Rosyid. Hey, my package! There's no package. Liar! Where's my package? Open it, Zis. I told you. There's no package. Liar. -I just checked it… -Liar! Okay. I know you killed Sigap. When did you know he was our guy? May I ask for a glass of water? -Yes, Mat? -There's a breakout. Miss, someone choked my partner. Mat? Rahmat? Rahmat! Mat! Ji, there's a breakout. -Guard him. -Yes, sir. Sir… -Stay where you are! -Stay where you are! -Hello? Yes? -Commander! We have a breakout! Dis? Dis! A breakout? Hold it! Move that! Ji! Aji! Quick! Hold it! Freeze! Stay where you are! Hold on! Do you realize where you are? Damn you! Get out, get out, get out! Get out, get out, get out! Come on! Syid! Come on! Do you want to rejoin them? Let's go! You go. I'm going to stay here. I still have loads of sins. Syid… -Dis. -Aji, Mr. Adi… Save Aji… You have to hold on, Dis. Hold it, Dis… Save Aji… A riot has broken out in Mako Brimob's jail, Kelapa Dua, involving officers and prisoners. We still don't have information about the cause. The riot in Mako Brimob, Kelapa Dua, was caused by a package. Calm down, Nani. That took place in jail. Your husband isn't in jail, is he? A riot has broken out. Right now, the riot… Aji is in the same complex as the jail. We're doing a persuasive approach with one of the people responsible inside. That's all the info I can give you for now. RIOT IN MAKO BRIMOB What's wrong? Is it time? Wait, okay? Murod. Murod. Murod. What you did stains this fight. It disgusts me. You said you had faith. But just one interrogation and you're already singing. Listen! Don't do what he did! He wants heaven, but he doesn't want the test. Scum! You, bring him here. You… Some of you, stand guard outside. Who is this? Mr. Leong. It's Sadikin here. What? What are you doing? Your squad cornered me here. You're a captain of a sinking ship. You still have a choice to let go of the lifeboat to save lives. We are angry. You cornered us. I told you. This is my choice. You'll see. -Aji, Mom. -Yes. -Mom, call Aji. -Okay. Hey, you. What's your name? You scum! Let us go! Your baby's crowning. Come on, you can do it. Push. Come on. Take a deep breath. Push. Come on! Push! Take a deep breath. Push. Come on! Push! Push. Hey! Do you know where Sadikin's house is? Come on! Push! Do you know where Sadikin's house is? Who is his wife? What are his children like? Tell me now or I shoot your head. Even to the death, we will never sacrifice our families! That's the difference between us and you. -Yes? -Mr. Leong. Sadikin. -Yes. -Please let go of one of my officers. As proof that they're still alive. Otherwise, I can't keep holding my squad back from attacking you. If your squad comes any closer, it will not only be your friends here who die. I will also finish off your family. I will let go of all of the hostages. I will also send their corpses! Mr. Leong. If you kill us… our squad will come in and finish you off. You better surrender now. Let go of the hostages. Hey! Do you think I'm afraid of death? We were ready for death from the start! Dying fighting is better than wasting time in jail. Do you know who Sadikin is? Do you know? Tell me, or else I will kill your wife and child. Bang! Keep pushing… One more time, okay? Take a breath. Scum! One of you will die. Commander Ruslan. Commander. No! Kill me! No! No! Kill me! Kill me! You coward! -Kill me! -Hey! Ruslan, you have to go home. An ace. Bring him out. Ji! No, Ji! I don't want to! No, Ji! Send my love to my wife and child! I don't want to! Tell them not to wait for me to come home! No, Ji! You should tell them yourself! You should tell them yourself! Let us go! The act of terrorism at Mako Brimob has been handled by the police.
