- Far, far away, in the mountains, far beyond the Blue Range, there lies a mighty mountain, a mountain no one alive dares approach, for legend says that deep inside the mountain a gruesome troll lies asleep. The troll is known as the Mountain King. According to the legend, only one thing can wake him, if the princess has not been married off before her 18th birthday. - Kristin, are you ready? Kristin! - Whether it was the princess' wish or not, all kings always found a bridegroom for their daughter before it was too late. - Welcome. - Oh Kingly Honor and Your Grace, with copious yet unostentatious jouissance, I Prince Frederik of Denmark in matrimony, your daughters hand, I do accept. - Ahem, these are just simple peasants, my liege. They don't really understand your sophisticated language. - How you doin'? It's nice to be here. The huge bear was running straight for me. But I am a brave man, so I threw myself at the bear. And then I wrapped my arms around its neck and squeezed and squeezed until the bear lay dead in the grass. Kristin! - No. - Kristin, listen to me! I am the king and as the king I command you to marry this Prince Frederik! - You just don't understand, do you? I don't want to get married! - Tomorrow is your birthday, and you will get married! Take this. - If the legend is true and the princess is unmarried on her 18th birthday, the Mountain King will awake and abduct her to his mountain. There she will be his slave. Kristin? - For the rest of her life. - Kristin? Kristin! - Hello? - Yeah, now we're even. Hi. I'm Espen. You don't have to shake hands. It's a silly custom, if you think about it. What about if we just shook hands from side to side? No, I got a better idea, get this, if I stand on one leg-- - My God! Do you always run your mouth? - Only after a near-death experience, then yeah it's possible I might talk a little-- - If you keep talking, then you might just have another one! - Whoa, look. You hungry? I've never seen anyone eat that fast before. - I haven't wanted to eat in quite a while. - I sure wanna eat now. So where are you going? - I have to be on my way now. Thanks for the food. - But. But I don't even know what your name is. - Who knows what the future holds? Perhaps, we'll meet against some day. Giddy-up! - Good morning, brothers. - What do you mean, good morning? We've been up and working since dawn. - Yeah, that's right. - Well, there's more to life than work. Hi, dad. - Well, boys, the vulture had a feast. Didn't I ask one of you two to put up a scarecrow? - Wasn't that Espen's job? - Yeah, Espen was gonna do it. - I hope you at least got what I ask for at the market, huh? - Yeah. Oh. Hey, you wont' believe what happened. This girl came riding by-- - Espen! - I swear to God and I fell into the river. - Enough! Boys, go get the bow and some warm clothing. - We were working all day. - All we had to eat was watery porridge. - That's why we're going hunting. - Really, can I come along? - No! - Listen, we all have to pull our weight around the house. And you gotta grow up. - Yeah. - Good. I want you to stay here and just look after the house. I don't want you-- - I could try-- - No, I want you to do nothing at all. Nothing, got it? - Yeah, I got it. - That's my boy. - Here. Sit on your butt and poke in the ashes. That's all you're good for. - Trolls. I'm not scared of trolls. No! No, no, no! No! - Of course, we're prepared, and what we don't eat, we can sell. - I can explain. I was just sitting in there poking in the ashes, when I heard heavy footsteps and I it was a troll. - Espen. What have you done, Espen? - But it's true. I mean, at least I'm pretty sure it was a troll. - You scatter-brain. You Ash Lad. - It's no use. Everything's ruined. - It was the only picture of her. - Good day, simple peasants. Have you seen a princess ride past here? Riding upon a majestic horse. Long, brown hair, stunningly beautiful, the princess, not the horse. - We haven't seen her. - What about you? - No. - He lies, my liege. - Let me snap his neck! Hey! - Loosen your tongue! - If you go and snap his neck, you idiot, how will he talk? Why didn't you tell me what you know? - Hey! I wouldn't pay attention to what this boy says. All he does is make up stories. Before we arrived, he told us he saw a troll yesterday. - So he believes in this old folk tale, huh? - Believes in the old? - Folk tale. - Fo? - Folk tale. - What folk tale? - That the princess will be abducted by a troll, if she isn't married before she's 18. - The king has promised that he who finds the princess will get her and half the kingdom. - Mm-hmm, that's right, she's mine. - And he's willing to give her away to just anyone? - The princess is gonna marry me, as soon as I find her, everyone knows that. And we are wed, she will without a doubt know her place. Simple peasant folk. - Here, this is all I have left. You two have to find the princess. Our only hope is to get the reward. It's the only way we can afford to rebuild the farm, or else all is lost. - What about me? - From now on, you're on your own. - But I can help you, I can stay and be your. - If you wanna help me, then it's best if you just leave. - Dad, please, let me just don't-- - No! Go. And don't come back. - Per, Per. - Hmm? - Come on. - Oh, look what I just found! - What'd you find? - A mirror, cracked. - What are you picking up junk like that for? - You might need it, you never know. Hey, look at this. - What'd you find this time? Argh! Get rid of it. - Gotta be good for something. - Help! Help! Help me. - Someone needs our help. - We gotta get moving. - If someone's in distress, we can't ignore it. - We have enough problems of our own. - All thanks to you. - Hello! Help me! - I'm gonna see who it is. - Come on, Pal. Come on! Farewell, Ash Lad. - Hello, help me. - I hear you. - Help me. Help me. Come closer. - Hi. - Thank heavens. I was just going to chop some wood and my nose got stuck. - Nose? - Don't stand there, staring at me like a nincompoop. Help me! - I'm sorry. - Hey, let go! Stop, stop! You have to use that hatchet. - Oh, I see. Okay, so you want me to chop off your nose. - Chop off my nose, are you insane? Use it to widen the crack! - All right. - Here, I have stood for the longest time. Food, I have had none. Water, I have had none! - Ah, I don't have much, but I've got this soggy potato. - And what brings a boy like you so far into the forest? - I'm looking for the princess. - So it's come to pass! The Mountain King has take her, just like the myth always predicted he would. - Isn't that just a fairy tale? - Don't you know, my boy, there's always some element of truth in every fairy tale. Ah, but you should forget it. There's nothing you can do for her now. - Wait! Saving the princess is my only hope, or I'll never be able to return home. - Boy, heed now! According to the ancient myth, there is only one sword that can penetrate the skin of the Mountain King. This sword is called Tvay-geer. - Where can I find it? - Forget it, it's too perilous! - Please, I have to know. - That sword was lost many years ago in an abominable marsh! That marsh is a place of evil. - And the marsh is where exactly? - I will give you my map, because you were kind enough to help me. This map will show you the way to wherever you want to go. - Thanks. - You must inquire of the map. - I have to... Map, show me the way to Tvay-geer. - That's not good enough, you must ask politely! - Pretty please. - Farewell then, Ash Lad. Ouch, my nose! - Listen to me, Kristin, I am the king. I command you to marry. - You just don't understand, do you, I don't want to get married! I do not want to get married. - Maybe it was a band of robbers that took her. - Band of robbers, there are things in that forest so bad, we don't want to think about them! - You are talking about that troll again. You know that's just an old myth. - The troll is going to force her to marry him, you know? She'll have to slave away the rest of her days. - Your Majesty! Your Majesty! Your Majesty. We found her horse, or rather the remains of it in Fern valley. And that's not all, because we also found this. - What in God's name is that? - Me thinks it's a tooth. - The Mountain King! - You know, yesterday I was hating porridge. - What? - Today, I'd given my left foot for a spoonful. Think they belong to anyone? - Nobody would notice if we just take one. - Each? - Yeah, one each. It kind of is a bit strange. But they're very good! - It's the best apple I've ever had. - Our apples are tasty? - We didn't know, we thought we could take 'em. - Where we come from there are all the apples you could ever want to eat. - Ever want to eat, whoa! - Wanna join us? - Hmm. - Yoo-hoo! - Come on, come with us. - Hurry up. - Where where are all the apples? - One more bite, then you'll see. - Espen! Espen! - Hey. Come sit with us. There's plenty to go around. - Let us never leave here. - How are you? Maybe think of eating another apple. Come on, eat it. Come on, eat some. There you go. I do so look forward to marrying you. Here you go. I'm so glad you came here to see me. Do you think I'm beautiful? - My dear brothers. Hey, I love you guys! - And we love you! - Come on, let's go check out our new home, yeah?` - And let all this food go to waste? Go to waste? - We'll have plenty of time to eat later. We're gonna be here forever. - Yeah! Excuse me,, could we be excused? - Yes, go off and enjoy yourselves. And we can make lots of tasty little delicacies for you. - Come on! Come on, come on. Come on. - My goodness, this place is such a palace. - Look at that. - Come on. - Where are we going? - We have to get out of here. - Why, we have everything we need. - It's all an illusion. The apples were enchanted. - Espen, why do you always destroy everything that works. First, you burn the house down, then you take us away from these delightful young ladies. - Wake up! - Now, we're getting married! - Run! - Don't go, I told you we were getting married! - Come on! Forest nymphs. - You won't get away! - Darlings, don't leave us. No, no, come back! No, don't leave us! Come back here! - Come on, come on! - No! - Thanks for saving us, Espen. - Don't worry about it, but if you see pretty girls with cow tails again, keep walking. - If trolls exist, why haven't we seen them before? - They turn to stone in the sun. They only come out at night. - How do you know that? - That's just the way it is. - Is there anything I should know about? Are there dragons? - Dragons? - What about unicorns? - Don't be stupid. - Why is that any more stupid than trolls? - That's just absurd. A horse with a horn, come on, we have to focus. First, we have to find the sword, and then we find the princess. - Try. - Mmm. Raw meat, my favorite food! - Oh my goodness. - Look what I found. - Yarn. What are you gonna start knitting? - You never know. - I'm not gonna make it. - Pal looks tired. - We're almost there! - Oh my God. Wait for me, wait. - Pal! Pal! What's going on? - Without food and drink, our hero cannot think. - Pal, we can't afford this, come on. - Well, it's a good thing that one of us was born with a sense of how to manage a budget. Espen, I want you to go over there and order us three large beers. And three bowls of sour cream pudding. And with a plate of cured ham on the side. And three large cinnamon rolls. - We don't really need those. - Without a cinnamon roll our hero cannot defeat the troll. If I don't get something to eat, I'm gonna hurt someone. Espen. - Brute, we've been telling you all along, you idiot. - Here you go, here's your wine. - Finally, want me to die of thirst? - One for you. And one for you. - Wait. Wait, wait, wait, wait. Just a second. Does this wine here smell like fresh fart to you? - Smells of fart. - Not just fart. Feet, sweaty socks, and a hint of gonads from a bull, yeah. Let me check. But mostly fart. Serve me some decent wine or I will buy the whole place here and burn it all to the ground. And that would be a gift to the world, thanks. We have to find the princess before someone else, otherwise we're lost. - Do you think the Mountain King has her? - That's so dumb, Little-Jan, there's no such thing as goblins or trolls. - There you go. - And three sour cream puddings with a plate of cured ham on the side, and three cinnamon rolls. - Yeah, I'll be right over. - And keep the change. - Thanks a lot. - You're welcome. - My lord. - What? - Guess what I just saw. - Cheers, brothers. - So can you show us the map? - Yeah. Ahem, map, show us the way to Tvay-geer, pretty please. It shows the way to the marsh that old lady was talking about. The sword must be in that pond. - That's what I call magic. - So that's where we're going then. - We need to get that sword in order to rescue the princess. - So we meet again. I think I forgot to introduce myself. Prince Frederik. - Espen, Ash Lad. - I apologize for being so gruff last time we met. I'm supposed to marry the princess. We're head over heels in love and she means everything to me. So if you have any information that might help me find my beloved fiancee, I would see to it that you are richly rewarded. - Just how richly rewarded? - There's enough here to rebuild the farm, even more than that! - Yeah. So if you know anything or happen to possess a let's say a magical map for example. - What a coincidence because we happen to - If you two really are so madly in love, then how come she chose to run away from your wedding? - Tell me where she is! - I'm sure we can come to an understanding here. Espen, give him the map. - Hmm. - No. - Hey, give him the map. - Hand it over now! - Give me it. - Go on, give it to him. - No. - Sorry, excuse me. - Give him the map. - Hi. - Ahem, here. That's three puddings. Three cinnamon rolls and some dried ham on the side. Careful, it's very hot. - So, where were we? - Espen? - Get them! Get them now! - No, no, no, no, no, no. - Where are you going? Hey, come out! - Ha, ha! - Catch! - Ha, ha. - Hmm? - I know you're there. Now, I've got you! - Give it back! - You just put your foot in it. - No, Espen, you're the one who put his foot in it, right? - No. Really just put your foot in it. - No, no! Mommy! - Come on! - I think we lost them. - Good. - There they are, get them! - Run! - Go! - You couldn't hit the broadside of a barn, could you? Could too! - You hit the tree! - Argh, stand still, will you? - Get them! It's over. Even Gunnar can hit you one with this close. Just give me the map and maybe I'll let you off with a couple festering wounds. - Do you remember when we jumped off that burned roof as kids? - What? When I broke my arm? - Yeah. - No, no, give him the map! - I'm bored. Kill them! - No, no, no, no. We'll give it to you. We'll give it to you. Here. - Hmm, yeah, come on. - Now! - No! - Be careful, my liege, watch out! - Damn it, to the horses. Christian, come! Christian! - Why didn't you just take the money, huh? We could've gone home now! - I couldn't do that, the princess needs our-- - The princess is not our problem! Are you so naive? Do you really she'll marry you? - No? - But now you made an enemy out of Prince Frederik himself. - Yeah, so what? - So what? He once strangled a monstrous bear with his own hands. - You know, I heard it was two bears. And his hands were tied behind his back when they attacked. - Are you sure there weren't three, and that he was blindfolded as well? - You know what your problem is? You don't realize that your actions have consequences for others. Every time you don't do your chores, it means twice the work for the rest of us. We're out there breaking our backs every day, and you don't even lift a finger! Our family would be so much better if you were not a part of it. - Hey, hey, calm down. Per, stop it! Stop it, Espen! Hey, stop. Stop it! Espen. Per! - Give me the map! Give it to me! Give me the map! - Per, come on, why don't you just can't you two just get along? He doesn't know what he's doing. - He's like a little child. He doesn't wanna grow up! - Hey, look what I found! - What did you find now, Espen? - An old bearskin. - Ah, you wanna take a flea-ridden bear hide up the mountain? - One man's trash is another's treasure. - Told you so. - Just give him a break. He saved us from the nymphs and the prince. And he brought a map. - Wait, wait! I know I have to marry you according to the legend. I know that! But I can't get married without a wedding dress! There won't be any wedding till I get one! - For God's sake, turn around. - Something's wrong with the map. What do we do now? - We'll just have to search for that pond. - Per! Pal? - Why couldn't the sword have been lost in the Bostie milkmaid's marsh instead? - Sh! We're not alone. Where's Espen? - He was right behind us a moment ago. - Espen! - What a pleasant reunion! Well, we can just pick up where we left off. Oh yeah. Where's the other one, huh? - Dead, hit a rock when we jumped into the water. Where is he? - He's dead! - I'm not asking you, runt! - He's not talking to you. - Where is he? Hey, where is he? - Per! Pal! I found it! - Do you think they really wanna kill us? - Stay calm, Pal. They don't know who they're dealing with. Get ready. - Ready, what do you mean? - Hey! Excuse me, there is something I forgot to tell you. - What? - Come here and I'll whisper it to you. I have a sore throat. Come on. - Hmm? - Pal, now! Come on, giddy-up. Come on, horsey, giddy-up, go. Come on. - You are dead. - What do you think, huh? - Very good idea, but I think we should now - So if anyone needs to take a leak, do it now. Gunnar. - Yeah. - You have to go? - No, don't have to go. - But do you think you'll have to go in about five minutes, and then we'll have to stop because of you? - Hard to say. - Then excuse yourself, hurry up! - A bear! A bear, it's a bear, it's a bear! Bear! - Bear, bear, bear! Should I get my crossbow? - Well, it's not like you're known for hitting things with your arrows. - You killed a bear with your hands once, go do something! - Well, that was a different kind of bear. - That's one very odd bear. - Hey! - A bear. - Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah. You are either the most courageous or the stupidest person in the world. Map, please be so kind as to show me the way to the hall of the Mountain King. Oh yes, yes, yes. Your darling brothers were kind chatty in your absence. - Yeah, they really were chatty. - I have no idea what's to come inside that mountain, but one thing's for sure. And that's you and your idiot brothers will be the ones to have the honor of making that discovery first. - What about Kristin? - I'm gonna marry her, how often do I have to say it? But make no mistake, if she defies me again that I don't mind ruling on my own if I have to. Tragic hunting accidents have often been known to occur in royal circles. - Great rescue, dear brother. - You should have seen Per's attempt to escape, while you were missing. That was something to ride home on. - Pal. - Why have we stopped? We know where we have to go. - Because my lowbrow friend, if the legend of the Mountain King really turns out to be true, then the troll hunts at night. All we have to do is wait until the sun comes up, when it's bedtime for little trolls. Then we'll just stroll into the cave and. - Let us drink a toast. To the future king and the future kingdom of Frederik the Wise and Brave. - You forgot handsome, but handsome's important. I'll let it slide. - I am so hungry, I would give anything to eat some fried duck right now. - Don't look, Pal, it just makes it worse. - Hey Frederik, you can't expect us to do heroic deeds on an empty stomach. - Fair enough. If you can reach it, then you can have it. - Yeah, that goose is yours. - That's a good thing. - That was good, wasn't it? - It's funny because they're tied to a tree and they have no chance to reach it. - Yes, that is why it's funny. Mm-hmm, you're absolutely right. Oh it's so funny. - What do you think dad is up to now? Do you guys think we'll ever see dad again? I miss him. - Come on. You wanna play that silly bear game again, with me, huh? I'm not dumb. I'm smart. Aren't I? - All three of them are here, right? - Good point. - What is that? Run! Run! - Hey, come back here! Come back here! - We gotta do something. Per, give me the stone. The stone! The stone. - Come on, stretch yourself. Yeah, okay. One, two, three. Aha, great. - Espen. Espen! Do it now! Come on, come on! Espen! Espen, now! - Run! - Pal! - Stay here, protect me. Christmas bonuses for all! - What do you mean Christmas bonuses? - Oh no! I hit him. - Espen. We're here, over here. - My hands, get this off my hands. - Now get mine off. - What's that smell? - I brought the goose. - Are you out of your mind? - What? - You're appetite is going to be our undoing. - Sorry! It's almost like I can still smell it. - Christian! - My liege. I won't abandon you. - I was afraid that thing had gotten you. - No, I'm pretty sure I managed to shake it off. - Oh you idiot, you led it straight to me. - I just wanted to protect you. - Christian. Christian. - My liege. - You've served me well. I wish to thank you for many years of faithful servitude. And for this, one last self-sacrificing act on my behalf. - What? Everything's fine! - Oh no, no, no, no, no. Mommy! - Do you think the troll is gone? - I don't know. - Hey, hey! - Pal! Pal! - Pal! - Help me! - All of this it's my fault. - I know I complain about you a lot. You're always daydreaming. And you can't hammer in a nail without tearing the whole house down. But you're really special. You are extraordinary. You have a feel for things others don't. You can do impossible things. Just in the last couple of days I've seen you fence with princes. Then I watched you read a map that was enchanted, and you outwitted forest nymphs. Pal needs us now. And this this is your world. When we go there, I'll be just as lost as you are back home. - Yeah. - So just tell me what to do, and I'll do it. No, no, no, no, no. No, no, no, no! No! I'm gonna die in here! Oh my darling, thank goodness! I thought I was gonna die here. I've come to save you. - Well, you're not really doing a job of it! - You have no idea what I've been through since you ran away. It's been one awful thing after another. - But you don't like getting your hands dirty, now do you? - No. I did it all for you. No matter what you may think about me, I care for you. - That's not the least bit true. All he wants is the throne. What's true is that he said he'd kill you after you were married. - No! Lies. This common thief tried to rob us while we were sleeping and-- - He's the one who stole from us! - Do you really expect the princess to believe some nameless scoundrel instead of her own fiancee? That was cool. Who are you? - I'm Pal. I live with my father on a farm with my brothers, Per and Espen. We set out to find you but that wasn't easy, because you were stolen by a troll. Hold on. - Then we were going to come-- - Did you say Espen? - Mm-hmm. - Red hair, vest, irritatingly positive. More courage than wits. - Yeah, that's him, yeah. - Did he talk about me? - Yeah, he said you're not really good on a horse. - Anything else he said about me? - Well, in the last few days, we were so up to our necks and stuff that there really wasn't much time for small talk. - And you think he will come and save us? - Look what I found. - Great. - Look, fireflies. - We gotta get going. - Do you trust me? There must be something here we can use. Glass jar. - Amazing what you can do with an honey jar. - Age before beauty. - Watch your mouth. Besides, you have the sword. - The hall of the Mountain King. Is that Pal's shoe? - Yeah. - Looks like a labyrinth in there. What do we do? - Better take some precautions, so we can find our way out again. - You do have your moments. - It'll take us years to search all these tunnels. - Espen. - Hey! - Espen? - Look what I found. - Espen. - Are you ready? - Yeah. Are you guys ready? - Yeah. - Yeah. - Kristin. Wait till your father hears about this. Nobody treats Prince Frederik like this. - Would you prefer to stay here? Do you want that? - Yeah, yeah. - Thank you. - Sh, sounds like he's coming back. - Hello, what's going on up there? - Sh! - I can't hear you! - Sh! - Don't tell me to shush, pull me up! Thank you, finally, my God. - Wait, wait, wait, please stay. No! - The sun's almost up, then we're safe. - Almost is not good enough, come on! - Wait, he'll catch up with us. We have to climb, get up the mountain. The higher up we are, the sooner we'll be in the sun! - Good idea. - Let's go, let's go! Hey, hey, wait for me! Wait for me. Oh no! The troll is coming! Oh no! Help me! Help! Help. Help me! What an idiot! Espen! - What do we do now? - This is my world. - Espen! - Espen! Per, no! - Don't do, no! - Per! Per! - Per, Per! Per! Per! Per, wake up, wake up, Per. Per. Per. Per, wake up. Espen, you have to do something. - Distract him! - Hey, over here! It's me you want, right? - The sun. Come on, come on! - I hate this forest. Hey! Hey there old woman! Oh my God, your ugly. - What do you want? - The palace, know you where it is? - The palace. That way, keep going straight. - Aha! A thousand thanks. - Idiot! - Outside. - Majesty. - Hmm. You know, for a messenger, you're really in pretty lousy shape. - Outside, outside. - Father, father! I want you to meet my friends. And one of them in particular. If it weren't for Espen, I wouldn't be here right now. - Yes, yes, yes. I guess you boys are here to ask for the reward, right? - A reward? What kind of a reward? - No, we sort of promised that whoever saved you would get-- - Ruling a kingdom sounds like a lot of responsibility for a simple farm boy like me. I'm only asking for enough money to save our house and land. - Yes, of course. - Just a sec, Your Majesty, yeah. Hi. So if I've understood correctly there is then an open position as king and Kristin's husband, because I wouldn't mind doing that, I mean in fact I could imagine-- - Pal. Yeah, sure thing. - Yeah. - Dearest subjects, there will be no wedding today or tomorrow. My darling Kristin, you may marry who you want, when you want. - And if I never want to? - I would highly advise you not to test your luck at this moment. Kristin. - Aw, big hug! - No, no, no big hug. Go for a run! - Is it possible for a couple of hungry wanderers to get some porridge? - You're back. Welcome home, son. Welcome. I'm sorry. - Me too, dad. Hey, dad. - But this is... You actually did it? - It wasn't us. It was Espen. - We just helped. - Your mother, she would've been very proud of you, Espen. - Call me Ash Lad. - Oh cut that out. All those nasty things I said, I was angry. I didn't mean it though. Listen, that name is a burden. - But I've gotten used to it. I think I'll keep it. - Ash Lad. Need some more. - It's here. Here, dad. - A break. - Oh, let me fix this. Here's another one. Bye. - See ya. Bye. - Goodbye. - I guess we'll have to work without him then. - Ouch. Ow! Boy, your riding really hasn't improved much, has it? - Do you wanna come with me or not? - Come here. - Yeah!
