Shit, they have forgotten the coupons for the toilet paper. I think we have everything. Fien, could you take care of the trolley? - Damn. - Mom, what are you doing? Yeah, I'm sorry, I was going in reverse and... Yeah, you know, I'm sorry. Sorry? What good is sorry gonna do! - You'll have to pay up, madam. Pay up. - Why? What do you mean, why? Do you see that dent in my truck? That's gonna cost a pretty sum. I hope that little wreck of yours is insured? Hey, some respect. Who says it's my fault? Hey! You were the one going in reverse. You didn't look in your rear-view mirror. - Why are you here with that monster of yours? - I know that kind of trick. - Trick? - You can't fool me. - Get your European accident statement. - Where is that dent? - Madam, you're looking at it. - That? You call that a dent? - While my trunk... - OK, don't start. Don't start. I know women like you. They're all the same. Sir, madam. It's always better to stay calm. I am calm. It's Mister Viking with his ten tonner who isn't calm. - You must be having your period? - And I bet you're still living with your mother. Madam, sir. - Now I get it. - What? Men with trucks. The bigger the car, the smaller the stick. Have you ever looked in a mirror? It's not just your car that looks used. - You want me to call the police? - Sure, make the call. Calm down. There is no need. We can settle this amicably. Forget it. We're not going to do anything amicably. Just make that call. - God damned. Crazy bitch. - Mom... Back in the car. Mommy is fighting. I have a proposition. I leave, you leave, and we forget the whole thing. - And my trunk, who's gonna pay for that? - It's only a scratch. You're gonna wait here with me till the police arrives. - You and your European accident statement. - Let me leave. My stracciatella is melting. - Your what? - My stracciatella. My ice cream. No one calls me a crazy bitch. Women. All leeches. I'll tell you a little something, you shit-ass driver. You sit there high and dry in your seat, but you can't see what happens around you. Everything around your truck is a blind angle. In fact, you are blind. You think you see everything in your truck, but you see nothing. And today you haven't seen me. Today I was in your blind angle. - What's your name? - Is that any of your business? - It doesn't hurt to tell me. - She's called Matty. - Back in the car, damnit. - I've got something for you. Just a second. What is that? Oh, no... - Someone wants a lolly? - Give it back. Come on. - From Italy. - Leave my children alone. - Italians make good lollies. - I'm not listening. They're from Milan. You know how they say lolly in Italian? - A lecca-lecca. - Now don't start a conversation. I'm not talking to you. I don't know you and I don't want to know you. You can call me Johnny. Matty. - Nice name. Short for Mathilde? - What are you doing, prince charming? - Come on, calm down a little. - And he's hitting on me too! - Woman, don't be so hysterical. - You are a first rate asshole. Oh, no, I can't believe it. Well, well, well. Johnny. Oh, my, they know you. Just one last signature here. - Here? - Yes, there. - You want to have a copy of that? - You can mail it too. That's good. That is settled. Bye. John, your turn. Come on, get in. John, why don't you join us one more time in the car. - Hey, you. - Dad. Hey, dad. - Why are you so late? - We were in a crash. - Yeah? Mom's fault? - It was a ten tonner. And the driver's name was Johnny. - Oh, and don't bother giving me a hand here. - Did a truck hit the back? No, I hit that truck with the back of the car. Again six years of no claims. - Two policewomen stopped by. - Oh, yeah? - Could you take a look at that? - You have to take it to the garage. How is school going, my little guy? Don't let them mess with your head. I'm doing great. - They already give us sex education. - Oh? Hey Matty, I have to go. Sure, you can't let what's-her-name get worried. Just take your backpacks. Daddy is a bit impatient. - And Vera? Where is Vera? - It's Friday evening. - Yes and? - She is almost seventeen. - What do I still have to say to her? - Mom. Here. Go to the car already. - Make sure to be careful! - Yes, yes. - And what else? How are you doing? - Fine. - How is what's-her-name? - Gail. - Oh, yes, Gail. I always forget. - Good, good. Very good. Must be exhausting at your age, no? - Gail is pretty adventurous. - What did you expect? So young. Matty, please. But the time to iron your shirts she doesn't seem to have. I still love you a lot too. Do you know that? You know that? Go on. The adventure is waiting. Vera, please. Vera, turn that down. Hello? Who is this? Mom, are you taking a bath? No, a big black guy is giving me a massage. A certain Johnny. Hi, Mr. Johnny? My mom can't talk on the phone. She's taking a bath. Yes, maybe in half an hour. No, wait. How did you get my number? You read it on the police form? And why are you calling? Yes, no, you shouldn't have said that. You have the manners of an asshole. What? No, you don't have to come and fix my trunk. I'll find a garage. What? No, but... Just walk to Italy and buy a lolly. - Asshole. - Got lucky? You don't want to know. Fifty, seventy, ninety. Ninety five and twenty three cents. There you go. - That's precisely right, my dear. Thank you. - Bye. Hi Matty. How is your health? - OK, Mr. Jacques. - There are a lot of tears in the world, aren't there? - How many? - 354. He was young. 62. Cancer. One in three, these days. - It's because of Chernobyl. - 354, that is 128,50. It will be a beautiful funeral. With Bach during the service. - I'm happy it's not Vivaldi anymore. - Too many violins, isn't it, Mr. Jacques. - Right, Matty. You understand my trade. - 128,50 plus 1,5 euro. And your receipt. See you soon, Matty. See you soon, Matty. He can't wait till the next one drops dead so he can come and see you again. He once asked me out to dinner. It's like the Last Supper. You don't think that's funny? What's going on? What's going on? My husband is going through his midlife crisis, my oldest daughter through puberty... my youngest thinks she's going through puberty and my son can't seem to get there. And my car has to be fixed. My life is all tears. It's Werner, isn't it? How long since he left? - Five months, two weeks, three days. - Don't keep track. It's not healthy. And there are always more fish in the sea. You have to go out more. He'll be back Nicky. I know him. - With that young little thing... - Passion lasts six months tops. - Then it's over. I know everything about it. - That means he still has two weeks to go. You're keeping track again. I don't know if I can keep taking it all. Let me tell you something. People are always stronger than they think they are. - In hindsight maybe. - Of course in hindsight. If you would know it in advance... Ask me something, mom. - Mom. - Fien, not now. Mom, please. One question. How long untill the potatoes are cooked? Mom, serious. - Will I win the lottery? - OK. - Vera, do you want to set the table? - In a minute. - You've just lived through difficult times... - Really? - And you have to think positive. - They are only cards, OK, mom? Vera, what do you know about that? - Blood sausage, again. - Your brother needs blood. Peter is autistic. Come on. He just needs to leave the house from time to time. - Mom, your last card. - What idiot calls at this hour? Vera, would you go and check? The star. That actually means a shooting star. - You can make a wish. - Hello? - So that's a good card. - Who? - I think dad is downstairs. - Ah, the truck driver. - Damn it. - Yes, just wait. Go away or I'll call the cops. - What's wrong? - It's for your trunk. - What? - The trunk of your car. - You have no right to be here. - I'm here for your trunk, that's all. - I'll find a garage. - I do it for free. - What? - I do it for free. Give me ten minutes and I'm out of here. - The car is over there. - Fien, go inside. OK, perfect. Shooting star... Mom, your blood sausage. How is it going? - I can take it to the garage instead. - That won't be necessary. What are you cooking? Blood sausage. How is your bumper? Have you gotten over it yet? - Yeah, yeah. I've smoothed the dent out. - Some dent that was. But I guess whoever touches your truck, touches you? - My truck is my life. - I knew it. - Without trucks the world would stop turning. - So you're important. Blood sausage. - Anything else? - Sorry? Well, blood sausage... With potatoes? Applesauce? - Yes. - Anything else? - Some mustard. - I knew it. - What do you mean, you knew it? - Mustard gets into your nose. You can't smell anything, or taste anything anymore, and it makes you cry. There you go. You want some blood sausage too? No mustard. Vera, give me your plate. Water? - Or a beer? - No, water is good. There you go. I cooked it too hard, but it's the taste that matters. - Vera? - Yes. There you go. - Enjoy your meal, everyone. - Enjoy your meal. Just perfect. Someone some mustard? Sorry. - Do you like 'em? Planes? - Yes, I want to be a pilot. Nice profession. Pilots are the truck drivers of the air. - Do you need a hand? - No, I'll do the dishes later. - Ask me something. - Why? Well, I will draw three cards. The first is the past, the second is now... and the third is the future. But you have to ask something. - What does my future look like? - OK. The devil... Moderation. The charlot. That is the conquerer. It means you will conquer something, get lucky. - If you look for it yourself. - You won't get it on a silver plate. - Don't pay attention to it, they're only playing cards. - No, they are real cards. - Coffee? - Yes, great. - Thanks. - What have you got there? - That? - Yes. Who is Nathalie? - Vera, please. - I can ask, can't I. Nathalie was the love of my life. - Is she dead? - No, no. She's in good health. How many of those tattoos do you have? I only have one heart. - Thanks for the food. - Thanks for the trunk. Would you let me pass? Thank you. - Still busy? - It seems to never end. Say... You feel like going for a drink with me? Some time. - Why? - Just, for a drink. Johnny, my life is fine like this. - How old are you? - Twenty nine. - I am forty three. - So? Do I have to spell it out to you? I don't know. I'll say you're my mom. We'll go for a drink once. - Only once. - OK, OK. Sunday evening? Sunday evening. Sunday evening, right? - Mom. - Bye. - Next time you'll go along to your dad's. - Why? - He's still your dad. - So? I don't like it there at all. With that Gail-woman. Yes, I understand. Hey, little guy. - How was it? - Good. We went shopping in Antwerp with dad and Gail. It was so cool. Really. - Just go upstairs. We'll be right there. - OK. Hi, honey. Hi, Vera. - Everything alright? - You bet. Mom is going out tonight. Yes, with a tough Viking. - How old is he again, mom? - Come on. When will you take care of our divorce? - Why the rush? - Rush? I won't wait until the end of your midlife crisis. You have to make a decision. Either sign the papers, or come back home. It's alright, I'll... I'll go and take care of the papers then. You want to have your cake, eat it too, - and fuck the baker's wife while you're at it. - Vera, tell her to stop. Stop doing what? Your shirts still aren't ironed! - And then you're surprised I'm not coming back. - What did you say? Nothing. Forget it. - I want some more time. - Time? To teach her how to iron? You've had five months and three weeks of time. I want to go on with my life. Hey, Vera, tell me, who is the Viking? Not my type, personally, but mom has some catching up to do. Guys, turn down the TV, will you. - I'm back in an hour. - You're not going out like that, are you? - Why? What's wrong? - Wait. I think it's OK. So. That. - That? - Yes, and then this skirt. And... wait. - That too? - Yes, but don't loose it! I like it. OK, I'm off. Do you want me to drop you off somewhere? - Well, see you on Friday. - How long since you've met? The... You... Johnny? Since Friday. Since the accident. It's the truck driver? Why, you want to see him? Hey, is that your mistress? - Damn, what a beautiful woman. - Come on, boys, take it easy. - You look good. - No need to start imagining things. The only reason I'm here is to piss off my husband. So not for my body? My husband lives with his girlfriend. This little 22-year old doll. - He was her teacher, once. - Teacher? Drawing. He teaches drawing at the academy. He's very talented. He makes beautiful things. I still love him very much. So don't start imagining things. Well, if you don't feel like being here, you don't have to stay, you know. - One red wine and I'm off. - OK. A glass of red wine, and a glass of water. My wife lives with her boyfriend too. I was on the road too much, with my truck. And she started seeing this lawyer. One of those real ones. With a mansion in Latem and a Mercedes on the porch. - For how long? - A year and a half. And you haven't met anyone else? No, I've been living like a monk for a year and a half. I don't trust women anymore. Women are leeches. They use you and throw you out. - Then what are you doing here with me? - You are different. I had noticed immediately. When you said I was blind. That everything around my truck is a blind angle. I thought that was beautiful. Right. You're a wise woman. Not wise like in Ghent, fun. That too, but... Wise like an owl. - An owl? - Well, yeah. You get the idea. Johnny, let me tell you something. If there's one thing I don't need in my life, it's another guy. My life is complicated enough already. I want to go home. I'm coming with you. - That cap looks good on you. - It's my daughter's. It makes you look a little Italian. - Hey, never mind being subtle. - I was just looking at your ankles. You have nice ankles. You deserve an elegant pair of shoes. I'm not sleeping with you. Not in a million years. - Do you hear that? - What? - The mustard bottle. - Ah, piss off. Now what's the problem, exactly? It's a beautiful evening. You are beautiful. And yet you have to pour mustard on everything. To make sure not to taste anything, not to feel anything. Like they say in Italy, una notte senza amore e una notte perduta. Come again? An evening without love is an evening lost. We're not in Italy. We are in Ledeberg and there is no love. I look at you and I see the Mona Lisa. Look. If you smile only a little, I don't feel like being on the road anymore. With my truck and my horizon. I feel like being with you. You are my Mona Lisa. I'm as crazy about you as Da Vinci was about his Mona. God dammit, just say that you want to sleep with me. No really, my intentions are nobel. You are full of shit. - And besides, Da Vinci was gay. - Serious? And that Mona Lisa, that girl isn't smiling. She's really sad on the inside. She just tries to hide it. She's trapped. She's stuck. - And how do you know all of that? - My husband. - You don't understand me. - You just want to talk me into bed. - That is not true. - Just admit it then. OK. - OK. - What, OK? Well yes, you're right, about that talking you into bed. - So you admit it. - Yes. Then just say so. Well, I would like to... - You know. - It's alright. What do you mean? I told you already, it's OK. OK. And now what? - It's a bit small, isn't it. - You don't have a lot of room. Hey wait. I just ironed that one. Oh, I'm sorry. Just a second. Sorry. - Is the door locked? - No, that would set off the alarm. - But can no one hear us? - No, don't worry. - And isn't it against the law, in a truck? - Do you always talk so much? Did you like it? - Are you crying? - No, I got something in my eye. - Where? - Do you have a tissue? Hold on. - There you go. - Thanks. Da Vinci gay. I never would have thought. And Mona Lisa trapped... Inside herself... I want to go home. - But... Already? - Yes, I have to go to the bathroom. Now. - Wait. Do you have everything? - It's alright. You go. - Hey, no kiss? - Silly. What if the neighbors see us! I just want a kiss. - I'm going. - Straight home! Fool. Are you still watching TV? Peter, Fien. Come on, up to bed. - Mom, it's almost finished. - Look, now it is. Tomorrow is a school day. Hop. Come on. How stupid, it was almost finished. Good night. - My little monkey. - Mom. Good night. - So it was fun. - What an idiot. - Nothing happened? - Happened? - Vera, you don't think I... - Mom... You've got your t-shirt on inside out. Mom, he's ten years younger. I felt it too. - How embarrassing. - Sorry, sorry. - He won't move in here, would he? - Vera, please, it was nothing. - Nothing. I mean, it was just... - Normal? No, the opposite of normal. I never did anything like that... with a guy... You know. So don't take that as an example, OK? It was only once. Once. Don't worry, I believe you. - Well, good night then. - Good night. Pico bello. - Mr. Jacques. - Hi Matty. - That's not much, is it! - Only twenty. She's one of those lonely creatures. 88-years old. Died quietly, like a candle. Her son lives in Spain. It can't be too expensive. It's his lucky day then. Only seven euros and twenty six cents. And how are things? Your health? Fabulous, Mr. Jacques. Fabulous. - There you go, your change and your receipt. - Thanks. See you soon, Matty. - Bye, miss... - Mr. Jacques. Tell me... Did you have sex yesterday? Not with that truck driver? What a slutty girl you are! And how was it? Did you go all the way? What did he do? - Nicky... - I always tell you everything too, don't I? Was it good? And Werner? I know. Actually, I don't know. Hello? Who is this? I can't hear you. - Who? - Johnny. Johnny Camione l'Amoroso. You still remember me? Yes, vaguely. - What's up? - I'm on my way to Italy. - Congratulations. - I have to go to Milano. - I'm still in Ledeberg. - I'm back on Friday. - So? - What size shoes do you have? - Why? - I want to buy you shoes. - Italian shoes. - I'll buy my own shoes. From Brantano. That's Italian too. Yes, but I know what shoes will look good on you. Johnny, yesterday, that was once. Only once, OK? Don't start imagining things. You still didn't give me your size. - I have to go. - I'll bring them on Friday. - I won't be in. - Do you know what they say in Italy? - Ti amo. - And do you know what they say in Ledeberg? Kiss my ass. Dad. We're making a meat stew. Hi, Fien. Hey big guy. You had the kids last weekend, didn't you? - Yes. But we have to talk, Matty. - Did you decide? No. I have information about your Johnny. I will go and set the table, OK? Johnny Vermeulen, that's his name, isn't it? - Yes. Yes. - He has a record. - Did he drive through a red light? - No Matty, he's an alcoholic. He did time for bar fights, and he hit his wife so bad she had to go to the hospital. She was there for two weeks. I know that from a good friend at the police station. I'm worried about you, Matty. And about the kids. Hey, you understand, right? I don't have anything with that Johnny-guy. Werner, don't. I think a lot about you, baby. We were good together. - Weren't we? You and me? - Oh, Werner. You have to decide. This week. I can't take it anymore. I will decide. Oops. Oh, sorry. How embarrassing. - Hi, Vera. - Dad. - Everything alright? - Yes. And you? Everything alright. I have to get going. See you soon, OK? Say hi to Gail, dad. - I will, Vera. - See you. What was he doing here? I'll explain later. Sit down. Then tell him he has to leave you alone. Mom, he was in jail! Mom, stay here. I had to guess about your size. I thought a small 37. I have a large 38. Did they fall off an Italian truck, Mr. Johnny? Thanks. - Enjoy your meal. - Enjoy your meal. Great stew Matty. Really good. Mr. Johnny, how often did you go to jail? Eat. Three times. Yes, the third time I got a discount. I did stupid things when I was young. But I was young then, right? You're still young. In school I was the one who got punished too. Even if I had done nothing wrong. And with your wife, you did nothing wrong there too? Vera. That's enough. That happened. That's true. I'm not hungry anymore. Good night. Vera still isn't back. - Are they OK? - They're small, but it's alright. - What happened to your wife? - To Nathalie? While I was on the road, she was lying in bed with that guy from Latem. One night she was talking in her sleep. Yes, Maxime. Please, Maxime. Then I knew. The next evening, I ask her, who is Maxime? I don't know any Maxime. Her face red like a tomato. And I... I shouldn't have drank so much. I used to drink too much. Then she admitted that this Maxime-type was her boyfriend. For three months already. Can you imagine? Three months. Then I lost it. What did you do? It was terrible. Sometimes it's hard to know your own strength. But I never wanted to hurt Nathalie. It was because I loved her so much. So you hit her out of love? - So? - Well, what do you want me to say. I shouldn't have been drinking. Maxime is a lawyer. You can imagine what happened. The divorce was pretty favorable for her. Two weeks in the hospital. OK, but at the same time she got herself a new pair of boobs too! I don't think that's funny. Since then I quit. I still have my truck. And I have you. Johnny, I'm ten years older. And I already have a man. - I never met anyone like you. - I want peace. Peace. I want my husband to come back. I want my life to go back to how it used to be. - And what about last Sunday? - Sorry. - That was not what you said last Sunday. - Sorry. - Matty, you're such a beautiful woman. - Fuck. - Come on, come here. - I used you. There you go, that's it. I used you. I wanted you. And now it's over. Finito. You understand that right? I drove more than a thousand kilometers today in one go. And with every line on the road, I got closer to you. Matty, you are my horizon. Johnny Camione l'Amoroso. Matty Mustard. But I like the shoes. Come here, you fool. Vera. - Some more coffee? - Please. Mr. Johnny, can I read your cards again? - Go ahead. - Fien, why don't you read my cards this time. OK. What's your question, mom? - Will I be happy? - Well good morning. Vera. - What time did you come home? - Late. - I was at my lover's. - Your lover? I'm almost seventeen. I can have a lover, can't I. If he has manners and he uses a condom. Make sure he uses a condom. The world. That's the best card, but that's the past. The devil. That means a great challenge. And then the lovers. That's a good card. That means everything will be alright if you listen to your heart. My heart. OK, I have to be at work in ten minutes. I'll be back after lunch. Vera, will you take Fien to her ballet class? And clear the table if you want. Peter, you'll look after yourself, right? Come on, guys. Bye, Mr. Johnny. Come on Vera, we're going to be late. Nice machine. - I used to read Buck Danny. - I've got the whole series. - What's your favorite? - Nineteen. The Tiger of Malakka. Not the one with Lady X, right? - What's your favorite? - Buck Danny against Lady X, of course. Do you have anything important to do, this morning? - Look at that, so many! - 560. - A woman who was well loved. - How did it happen? - An accident involving a person. - What do you mean? She threw herself in front of a train. About forty. Married. And kids, of course. How does something like that happen? She must have snapped. Yes, that will be 203 euros and 28 cents. And how are things, how is your health? Alright. Thank you, Mr. Jacques. After all, that's what matters, right? See you soon Matty. Miss... Hi, I'm here with certified mail. - Can I see your ID please? - Sure. I'm ready to snap, but I won't go and jump in front of a train. - What are you saying? - I don't know what to do. Choose dear, choose. Nicky, he is 29 and I'm 41. And he has a record. - I know, I know. But is there a spark? - Yes, there is. You're running away from yourself, Matty. - Is it serious, the two of you? - And what about you? Keep it polite, please. Well yes, actually. Yes. Then ask him for dinner tonight, OK? OK, but I don't think you are ready. - These days I'm ready for everything. - OK. We're eating chicken casserole, OK? - What is Peter doing? - Out with Johnny. - What? - Yes, there was a note. - Where? - Here. I am out with Johnny. See you, Peter. - Oh, it's you. - Who did you think it would be? Johnny is out with Peter and I don't know where to. - And you let them? - They can be back any moment. - What do you want? - I think I have decided. You think so or you are sure? What's wrong? Gail and I had a fight. Because... Because I told her I want to go back. To you. She wants to build her life with me, but I'm not up for that. I can't give her that. It's too intense. Could you come back home with me? I want to have that peace back. Matty, I want to draw your portrait again. I want... if we could... to go on where we left it. You and me, Matty. Toi et moi. Ensemble. I can't live without you. I know that now. Now I see. Some sense of timing you have. Peter? Hey mom. - Hey dad. - Big guy. Where did you go? Where did you take my son? Our. Our son. Mam, it was so cool. I saw a Beluga. An Airbus Beluga. And a Tupolev. And a 747. Really, it was so cool. - I'm John. - Werner, Peter's dad. - It was so amazing, dad. Really. - Oh, yeah? But you know... I promised we would go to a big Spitfire-show together, right? That's what we'll do. You'll be stunned. Come, Peter, let's go inside. Johnny, you stay over for dinner, right? - When will your boyfriend be here? - About now. - So you're a truck driver? - Yes. - And you teach drawing. - Yes, at the academy. He likes the evening classes. - Great chicken casserole, mom. - Thank you my angel. - Is that it? - You can start with that. Sorry. - Enjoy your meal, everyone. - Enjoy your meal. I often drew Matty. Yes, in the past. - Beautiful. - This is a sketch. With carbon. I don't know if you can see that, but it's a really particular technique. I like working with carbon. It's so primitive. Primitive, indeed. There are a lot of nudes down in the basement. Yeah.. I've always wanted to exhibit them. - And the title, My Matty. - Don't you dare. And Gail? Do you have beautiful drawings of her too? Vera, please. I wouldn't want to teach drawing. Even if I could. I need more movement. Action. Listen, let me tell you something. I love Matty. - Me too. - What future can you give her? - And my children? - They don't need to hear this. I think they should know. Alright? I'm sorry, baby. - How's the pay, as a teacher? - Johnny, you too. Stop it. - I'm just asking. - I teach children to make beautiful things. I bring out the best in them. That's not a profession. It's a vocation. - My job is a vocation too. - There are a lot of cowboys out there, no? That's a myth. If there is an accident, we always get the blame. Hey buddy, I read the news too. If someone passes me on the highway at 120km/hour... I'm surprised, stunned even... that there are not even more fatal accidents. Johnny, Werner, can we just eat? But you never got hit by a truck in the back of your car, right? - Matty did. - Wait a minute, that was not my fault. The police didn't see it that way. - Of course, those cops were chicas. - What are you saying? Female police officers, but that doesn't matter. It does. - They have something against me. - Why would that be? - So I'm a danger on the road? - I didn't say that. - I didn't say that. - OK, we're done now. - With me, he didn't drive too fast. - Say that again? With me, he didn't drive too fast. - That would be too bad. - Yes, done. - Mam, dad... - That is so typical for an intellectual. You know what my dad always used to say? All those intellectuals have one thing in common, they know nothing. - And your dad was a philosopher? - He switched train cars here in Moscou. - That explains it all. - What is that supposed to mean? - Nothing. - I think the chicken casserole is delicious. - Peter? Fien? Vera, sit down. - Switching train cars... He was proud of it. Just like I'm proud of my truck. At least it's useful. Not like messing around with carbon. You're insulting me. - Speaking of primitive. - There's only one who is primitive here. Shit. You're kidding. I'm leaving. I'm going to do the laundry. By the time I come back, I want all of you men out of my house. They're both gone. Johnny left first. He went to wash his shirt at his mom's. And dad first helped with the dishes. Then he just stood there for a bit longer. Because he thought you might come back any time, but you didn't. So then he left too. Just come home. It's late already. Why did you bring a girl over? So? What was that again? Why do you have to be special? I'm just in love. You're still a child. You just don't understand me. Being in love is different from humping a driver in the back of his truck. You know, when I was your age, I knew one thing for sure. I would be happy. No one would mess with my business. No one would fuck with me. Not with me. No, I would be happy. I would be fucking happy. When I met your dad... I was nineteen, he twenty three. - Mam, I don't need to know all of that. - No, I want you to know. Your dad and me, we were in love. I saw him and he saw me and we were both lost. We couldn't keep our hands off each other. And the sex we had! Every day. - Every day, until we were exhausted. - Mom, please stop, it's so embarrassing. I still hear him say, please, stop. - My cock is all numb. - Mom, please. And he was funny. And smart. He held the door open for me when we went somewhere. And he could draw so beautifully. I knew. He was the one. With him I wanted to have kids. With him I wanted to grow old. With him I would be happy. Today I have to restrain myself not to jump under a train. - Mom, please, don't say that. - I'm going crazy, Vera. Totally crazy. I didn't ask for this. I want a normal life, you understand? A normal life. Please, mom. And Johhny who keeps knocking on my door. What am I supposed to do with that? Is he the one who makes you unhappy? No. He doesn't make me unhappy, no. Come on, let's go. His mom doing his laundry... - You don't fancy him, do you? - Oh, mom... Men and me... And besides, you're the grown-up. You have to choose. Hey. And? Did the stains come out? My mom said to let it soak for a bit. With some Blanc Nuclear. - And your shoes? Not too small? - It's OK. Mom... Mom, I'm hungry. Come on. Serious? Really? - Are you sure? - We should make a toast to our future. A special moment. Come here. Cheers. - You're gonna lose, you're gonna lose. - Who says that? Just wait and see. - And Werner? - He can draw some other woman's portrait. - And two spaghettis. - Thanks. You're gonna lose. I'm telling you. That nap will pep me up. - Hey mom, can we have doughnut bolls? - No guys, you just had food. Johnny. Nathalie. Wat are you doing here in Ledeberg? - The market is for everyone, no. - You have no market in Latem? - With the fancy people? - Johnny, bonjour. Oh, I remember you. From court. Mr. Lawyer with his dirty tricks. - Quiet! In your basket. - What did you say? - Come, we're going. - Come on, we too. Beware of his tricks. - What kind of tricks? - Lawyer's tricks. You fuck us from behind and in the dark. Just like my Nathalie. - From behind and in the dark. - Come on, we're going now. Take him away. He has been drinking. It's in his blood. - Fuck, dammit... - Stop. Stop. - Did you hear what he said? - Stop or I never want to see you again. What is it? You're gonna throw me out too? - That was my wife, after all. - But you're with me now. I'm with you. - Come, just leave him with that old cunt. - Hey. - At least I'm all real. - This scar is real too. - Now I'm getting him. - No. Stop. - Try me. I'm calling the police. - A smack on the face is what you'll get. Look at me. Look at me. If he lands you in the hospital as well, give me a call. I'm a lawyer for battered women. - Johnny. - Well, well. Trouble, Johnny? Now look who's not talking anymore, isn't that right, Johnny? You didn't change a bit. Not a bit. I'm sure he has a nice explanation. - And that's your car, sir, I presume? - Fuck. I will get you. You don't know what you're getting yourself into. You lost your truck. - Matty. - Hey. You can stay a bit more. They're too small anyway. A hundred euros. Yes, a traffic accident. Two victims. - Not even twenty years old. - How many letters are those? Here is 550 and there another 400. I need two receipts. That makes 344 euros and 85 cents. And how is your health? You're a little pale today. - Thanks. - We still need to go and have dinner once. - Yes, the Last Supper. - What? We will, some time in the future. That's what I like to hear. Look, I'm all happy now. See you soon, Matty. Miss... What are you here for? Penalty stamps don't exist anymore. Matty, how are you? - My car wasn't seized. - Congratulations. - I want to send a letter. - Sure. Let me check the weight. - I didn't write it yet. - Sir, there's a line behind you. I would like to buy one of those special cards. One that says, I'm sorry. That says what? Sorry. - With or without music? - With. We don't have those. And without neither. Sorry, sir. Next. Something up? I'm starting to understand why my daughter is into women. Madam, women need men like a fish needs a bicycle. I think you've been a little harsh on him. - What? I can't hear you. - I'm saying you were a little harsh on him. No need to feel sorry for him. Men only want one thing. - And I should know. - It's for your pension, right? - Werner is coming back. I have decided. - Are you sure? - Johnny is not my future. - We all end up in a letter like that. It's the only future you can be sure of. Believe me. Hey, thanks. Mom? Hand me your plate. Enjoy your meal. It's really good. Look. I can stay. No, you can come tomorrow. There is no rush. You and me, right, Matty? You and me. Mom, I'm going. - Mom? I'm going. - And where are you going? I'm seeing Iris at the Terminal. At the Terminal. Why don't you walk with me? - What do I do if Johnny is there? - Nothing! Just ignore him. What are you gonna do, stay inside for the rest of your life? Everyone makes mistakes Everyone can be wrong No one is perfect Or always sure of everything - Everything OK? - Yes. Hi. Oh, no. Mom, just ignore him. Matty. I'm here with my daughter and her girlfriend. Werner will be coming home tomorrow. - Can I buy you a drink? - No, thanks. - Johnny, come here. - Go on, your buddies are calling. - I'm leaving for Italy tonight. - Bye. I don't know if I will be back. Hey, Johnny. - Just one, and then we're off. - Mom, we just got here. I'm going to the bathroom. Can I have another beer? - You want one too? - Yes. Hi. Two beers and a red wine. - So Iris, are you still in school? - Yes, first year nursing training. I want to specialize in palliative treatment. - Palliative treatment? - Mainly talking to people. - Oh, right, those are the people... - That are about to die, indeed. And why? Isn't that heavy? Yes, but it's so real. You know? Those people really know they're dying. They're so real. Because people learn from their own mistakes Another warm round of applause for Devos Daisy. We all make mistakes. True words. Thank you, Daisy. And from this moment of joy, we're going into a moment of romance. Someone asked me, can I sing a song for someone here in the room? I don't know who it is. But we'll find out soon. I'm not gonna say any more. I'll just introduce him. Here is Johnny Vermeulen. Applause! You gotta be kidding me. Damn it. What a fool. This is super-mega-embarrassing. It's pretty real, I think. Come on, let's go. Give him a warm round of applause. Johnny Vermeulen. What a great voice, what emotion. Applause. Johnny Vermeulen. But the night is not over yet... Mom, can I show Iris my room? Please. Thanks. Matty, what are you doing? Stop it. Stop. - Now look at that. - You're like a kid. I can't even go out without you making me look like a fool. Mona Lisa, my ass. - Is that why you came over? - Yes. And to say you have to leave me alone. I think you are coming for something else. You're still a baby, you. A baby. You and me, there is no way. - Please, just calm down. - I'm not your Mona Lisa. - Stay out of my life. Leave me alone. - Calm down. - I'm serious. - Calm down, I'm telling you. If you tell me to calm down one more time, I'll smack you in the face. - Go ahead. - I swear I'll smack you. You can't. Fuck. Now you're not laughing anymore, are you? Johnny Camione l'Amoroso. You dare to hurt me. Dare you, god dammit. I don't know how to explain this to my mom again... You're such a fool. And you're such a crazy bitch, you. Look at that. You can hardly look through them anymore. Poor you. - Well, I guess I have to leave. - When will you be back? Wednesday. - Will you stay over for dinner? - And what about your husband? I'll send him a text. Hey Matty, I wanted to ask you... You think it can work? You and me? Ouch, my nose. Fool. Hi, Matty.
