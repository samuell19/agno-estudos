Reuven's Garage. Hi, Shmulik, what's up? It's almost done. Toufik! Shmulik asks if the car will be ready by 4:00 p. M. Sure, no problem. - It's okay for 4:00 p. M. - Dad, come have a look! We'll fix the brakes and take it to Vehicle Inspection. Okay. Come over. - Toufik! - What? - You want to drive me crazy? - What's wrong? How come you didn't tell me there's an oil leak? - I told you. - Oh yeah, when? - Like hell you did! - Meir, drop it. Who cares? It's not my problem that you don't listen. I'm fed up. I always get the screwed-up cars. Hassan will help you. Meir, just finish it. - Pull... - He heard perfectly well. Meir! - I'm going to lunch. - Come on... I'm starving. Hurry, the Mitsubishi's waiting. Why do customers keep calling me? Can't I leave you guys alone for five minutes? What's going on, Mali? Why isn't anyone working on Yossi's car? - It's... - Where is Meir? A part was missing. He went to... Now? He couldn't order it this morning? Yossi's a worrywart. It'll be ready on time. Call your brother. - When will you be done? - In 15 minutes. Okay. - Hassan, are you done? - I tightened the pipe. Is it ready? - If Meir's not back, take it for inspection. - No problem. - Well? - I left him a message. He didn't pick up? - He didn't answer? - I guess he didn't hear. - Where's the stamp? - Upstairs. Yossi was already in a bad mood yesterday, and I warned him. I'd told Meir it was urgent. - Where's the lemon? - And? And what? Go on. Finish your story. Get to the point. It's a good thing we have Toufik. He finished in no time. Meir jerks off for two days. Toufik is done in 30 minutes. That's your point? I had to give him a discount. The job was done. Why'd you give him a discount? Because! I lost 300 shekels today because of him. You know exactly what needs to be done. That was after spending the whole day at the accountant's. And? I didn't understand a word of what he told me. I kept getting calls. Unhappy customers... and Meir wasn't even there. How can I do business like this? Turn off your phone. Is that so hard? What if you called? Which shampoo did you use? The green one you bought me. Your dad is so handsome! Aren't you eating? Where's the spoon? I give you responsibilities and you don't give a damn. Why not? You think that's how you run a garage? Where were you? If you want to run the place... ...you stay there all day! That's how you run a business. Where were you? Who cares? - I can't run a business like this. - Why are you shouting at me? - You made me lose 300 shekels. - It's my fault? 300 shekels is nothing? Reuven, we said we'd deduct it from his salary. Some salary! - Stay here! - I'm not hungry. I've had it with him, Reuven. - I'm sick of him. - Ossi. The garage is our means of living. It's all we have. Who'll take over? "Hassan and Sons"? Very funny! Reuven! You're not concentrating. - Harder. - Here? Right here? Press harder. Do it right. You're just stroking them. - What? - Press harder. Meir... Meir? Mali, would you? Would you, darling? Your father's hopeless. - Are you going out? - Yes. Turn that down, Meir. Meir! Press harder. Now he's hungry. Don't eat all of it! Well, sit down. I'm off. - Hold me. - Bye. Bye. Are you sure? What? Sure of what? Maybe we're making a mistake. You call this a mistake? Come on! This, a mistake? It's the most beautiful thing in the world. God is great... At last! Where were you? Don't you have work to do? The Subaru's ready. I'm going out for an hour. What do you mean "going out"? - I have to go out. - Nissim's car isn't finished. He's coming at 4:00 p. M. There's time. You don't do your errands on our time. I'll hurry. No big deal. Since when do you leave in the middle of the day? Knock it off, Meir. I have something to do. I don't care. You have a job to finish. Do it on your own time. Meir, he has an errand to run... - Shut up! - Hey, don't talk like that. Speak nicely, okay? She's my sister. I'll talk to her however I want. Get under the car. I'll be back in an hour. Toufik! I'm serious. You're not leaving. - Leave him alone! - Shut up! Watch it, you bastard! You know what? If you leave, don't come back! Son of a bitch! You stay out of it! Are you in charge here? Fucking son of a bitch! He's gone! This is a certified translation of your civil status. You'll need the original to get married abroad. Here you have the address of City Hall. It's on the third floor. A clerk will help you. You can get your marriage certificate stamped there. Our driver will take care of it the same day. You can get it in Israel too, but it takes about a month. It's all written here. - It's in Hebrew, is that okay? - Yes. I'm not sure you know ...about our special deal for guests. 220 dollars for four people, two rooms. Nice... It's just us. One more thing. Toufik? I don't know if anyone told you about the El Al service. You can check in your bags the night before the flight. That way you won't lose time on departure day. with security controls. Thanks. It's okay. Well, congratulations! Hello, Reuven's Garage. Yes, we do. It depends. Exactly. It depends on the damage... Hey, what's going on? What? You think this is a whorehouse? Get back to work. I told you not to come back. What are you doing? You don't work here anymore. Don't touch the car, you don't work... What's going on? He splits when he feels like it. So what? He decided to go for a stroll around Jaffa. He goes out during work hours. ...and shouts like he's the boss's son! I told him not to come back. - You said what? - I fired him. Fired him? Are you crazy? Have you lost your mind? Since when do you fire people? Who'll work? You, by yourself, for the whole garage? Yeah. Who does the work? That Arab? Don't talk like that. Okay, back to work. - You too. - He doesn't work here. What do you mean, "he doesn't work here"? Get out! Get out of my sight! This isn't kindergarten! Hassan, pick that up. Tomorrow I won't be in until 2:00 p. M. You let him do what he wants. But you keep tabs on me. The Arab carries on like Allah's CEO, and you let him. He had some errands. It happens once in a blue moon. You never have errands to run? Today you got there at 10:00 a. M. And left at 2:00 p. M. I left? You threw me out! Try paying me like Toufik! Work like him and I'll pay you double. He was gone for four hours. Left me with two cars on my hands. Four hours and you say nothing. But you yell at me? Wake up, they're screwing you. - One day your garage will be gone. - Yeah, sure. Playing the big shot! "Meir, I have something to do. " "Meir, I have an appointment. It's urgent. " Those dogs are squeezing us dry. That's enough! Trusting an Arab... I told you to fire them both long ago. Didn't I? Why did you say "four hours"? He went out for one hour, that's all. Why should I do that stinky Arab's work? Do your own work for a start. Because I do nothing? I didn't mean that. You work. But don't talk like that. Why didn't you mean "that"? It's time we were honest. We give you a salary. It's more than other parents do. - Some salary! - Where are you going? Sit down! I told you to sit down. If you want to eat, sit down. I won't have you terrorizing us. If you want to eat, you sit down. If you don't, you can get lost. Without the food. Get your elbows off the table. - He does it on purpose. - Stop it, Ossi. Shut the fuck up! All he knows is insults! The big hero... You're disgusting. Just like your room. You stink like your room. No girl would come near you. Stop it, shut up! "Shut up, shut up... " - Calm down. Come here! - Shut up! Don't talk to your mother like that and don't break plates! See how he talks to me? Come back and apologize. He can't talk to me like that. - How can you allow it? - I don't. Stop it now. Did you hear him? The way he talked to me? Did you hear? The boy is a plague! I'm telling you. I don't want him in this house anymore. This is my house. Do you hear me? This is my house! Now get out! I want you out of here. Did you hear me? Get out! Did you hear me? Who do you think you are? Who do you think you are? Answer me. I'm your mother! Loser! I've put up with your shit for 20 years and this is the thanks I get? Start packing! Ossi, stop it. Ossi, please. - Don't you dare defend him! - I'm begging you. Please stop. - Don't defend him. - I'm not! Don't defend him. Get up and start packing. You're not staying another minute. Get up! - Calm down, I'm going. - Where are you going? I'm going. Get out of my way. That's that! Idiot! Loser! Mom. Dad's asleep. Let's go to bed. - Good night. - Good night. - Good night. - Good night. Hi, Meir. You're not answering. I think you can come home. Mom's calmed down. Don't get too drunk. See you tomorrow. Bye. - What's up? - Meir might sleep at the garage. - You think so? - Yes. Be careful if he's there. - Are you okay? - Fine. Bye. It's open. Meir. Wake up, you're at the garage. I'll make you some coffee. I threw up. You're here too? - Mali, are you ready? - Coming. Did Meir leave you a message? No. He didn't sleep at home. Where are the keys? He'll have a hangover again. Bye, darling. Mali, we're late. She hasn't had her coffee. Let's go! Lucky me! Hassan, turn that radio off. Turn it off. Let's see about this car. - This needs to be replaced. - No problem. - And the pump? - That too. One more. My car's been overheating all morning. I have an important meeting. I've only got 10 minutes. - This your first time here? - Second. - Are you from Jaffa? - No, Tel Aviv. - Is it smoking? - I don't know. It's overheating. Hassan! He'll check it. We need to finish this one first. - How did you get here? - I stopped a lot... - Yes, what is it? - The car's overheating. Check the radiator... - Hurry, please. - Fifteen minutes, tops. - Meir, now? - No, tomorrow! - Have a drink. - No, thanks. Let him work. He knows what he's doing. He's a good worker. Meir, please. We have to finish up. He'll do this first, then he's free. - The client's coming... - I've had it. He'll do this first. - Don't touch my father! - You're pushing me? Don't touch my father! - Stop it! - Move! That's enough! Come here! Stop it! Let go of me! Let go! Meir... What's going on? Is that at our place? Move away, come on! Move back! I'm the owner. Let me in. What happened? Meir... Toufik! Hassan? Please, sir. Lift him up a little. - What happened? - We don't know yet. No one can tell me what happened? Easy does it, guys. Meir? Would you tell me what happened? Did he fall? From falling? - Sir, one minute. Follow us. - The police are here. Hassan? One moment, miss. Can't anyone tell me what happened? I'm his father! I'm his father! Excuse me! What happened? Can someone tell me? - It's Meir. - I know that. Be more specific. What happened? He slept at the... Garage. He and Toufik had a fight this morning. And... And what? - What? What happened? - It's not good, Ossi. - What happened to him? - I don't know. Dad, can you pull over? - What? - Pull over for a second. - I have to throw up. - One moment. Just a second. You okay? It's here. The operating rooms? - Hello, may I help you? - Wolf, Meir. Right. I'll get the doctor. Dr. Cohen, the Wolf family is here. Take a seat. She's on her way. - Is he still in surgery? - The doctor will explain.
