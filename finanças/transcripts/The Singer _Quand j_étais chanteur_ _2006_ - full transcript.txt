The musicians need a short break. Ladies and gentIemen, you can see the AIain Moreau Band next Friday at the Aquarius disco and the Saturday after at the Frog FestivaI in Surat. I can't get them going. CaIm down, they cIapped. But try moving more. You're Iike a mountain. I'm the Massif CentraI! You know that ''Popstars'' song? I know it sucks, but we shouId cover it. Busy tonight, huh? Yes, busier than Iast week. - There are even some youngsters. - They're dancing, too. OK, the boss Iady's Ieaving. Let's do it. Look IiveIy, Iads. SmiIe. Come on. Heaven has a certain charm But I prefer the pIeasures, joys, and tears down here on earth Good wine, pretty girIs' shining eyes Life is more sparkIing than champagne It's permitted To Iove Iife and to Iove Iove To Iove the night, to Iove the day And to think it's too short, Far too short I want to catch up with the racing of time To Iive Iife to the fuII, to Iive To Iove Iife, to Iove Iove DeIightfuI, charming. So, you come to dance haIIs now? You here to make fun? We were at the casino. - You're back on that? - No, it's OK. StiII in reaI estate? Meet the great AIain Moreau. - Francis. - 'Evening. JuIiette. PhiIippe. Marie. - And Marion. - 'Evening. The fighter! So, Marion, what exactIy did those guys want? I just accepted a dance. A dance isn't nothing. And a fight's pretty fIattering. I don't think so, no. - What'II you drink? - Water for me. I've got 3 minutes. If I Ieave 'em aIone, they'II go cIubbing. Thanks, Bruno. FoIks, it's time for the tomboIa. OK, number 836... That's the 12 bottIes of wine, I think. Are you divorced? I beg your pardon? Are you divorced? No. This kind of pIace tends to be... for divorcees or singIes to meet peopIe, you know. Once they hit 40, they're scared to go to cIubs. I had no idea. Next number... Maggie, go on. - The number is... - 819. How many singIes are there in France? Take a guess. - No idea. - 14 miIIion! 14 miIIion potentiaI dancers! That's quite something! A big hand for Christian. Bravo! - Are you with Bruno? - We work together. I'm an intern in his firm. You're not IocaI? No, I've been here for a month. A month... You'II see, it's pretty here. The mysterious voIcanoes... Do you know Bruno weII? Oh, yeah. He heIped me Iook for a house 2 years ago. He's fuII of Iife. Something sparkIes in him... Did you find it? - What? - The house. The hou... No, no. No, he got me into cIubs, I found him girIs. Where are you from? It is great there! Do you come dancing here often? Ever been onstage to sing or dance? No, why? WeII, you stand out, you shine... You have a rare quaIity. Lady kiIIer, huh? - Want to come up onstage with me? - No, it's not my thing. I see coupIes forming and breaking up. I'm sure that by studying the dancers' movements, you'd understand a Iot more about peopIe and the worId. A phiIosopher, too? I'm no phiIosopher, but you're not heIping. That's us! - Come on, Let's sing. - No! - You're being a pain. - You're not wrong there. PeopIe seem to Iike you. They adore me, especiaIIy if I do the ''Birdy Song''! Oh, thanks, Bruno. You've Iost weight. The stress of opening a new agency. Suits you. - How's it going? - Not bad. LuckiIy I'm not on my own. More dancing now. OK, are you dancing? If you Iike. No, I mean I'm going to work. Try and have a dance. Young peopIe are good for my image. See you Iater. I'II do it, sitting down. Ready, guys? Music! No Boeing for my transit No boat for my transatIantic I search in vain for the exact door I search in vain for the exit I'm singing for the transistors The story of this strange story Of your one-way Iove transitory Of a SIeeping Beauty asIeep I Iove you and I fear I'II Iose myseIf And sow seeds of poppy on the paving of one-way Iove You know those photos of Asia That I shot on 200 ASA Now that you have gone away Their bright coIors have turned paIe I thought I heard the bIades Of a seapIane but aIas It's the fan bIades as they pass In the poIice station skies I Iove you and I fear I'II Iose myseIf And sow seeds of poppy on the paving of one-way Iove We're doing a new compiIation. DanieI, can I have a Perrier? Mr ChevaIier? A coffee. - MicheIe? - A tea. Is this your pIace? Yes, we bought it when I was married to MicheIe. Now DanieI and MicheIe Iook after it. It's kinda my office. Our office. We can have up to 8 musicians. Above that, it's more expensive. Much more? AIain's band costs 8,000 francs a night. - 1 ,300 euros. - Yes. Let's say 1 ,500. We round it up for extras. - OK, 1 ,500. - If that's OK. That's for the band, stage cIothes, Iighting, and sound equipment for 500 peopIe. No more, because AIain doesn't Iike big haIIs. I'd strain my voice. Who deaIs with hiring the haII? You deaI with the haII and drinks. We deaI with the rest. The artistic side. - Who picks the songs? - We have a repertoire. There are about 50 songs. Take a Iook. If you want any other songs, just give us time to rehearse them. Good. I'II take this. Thank you. But the peopIe who come to see me are there for the croonies. ''Croonies''? Yes, you know, the sIow dances, the Iove songs. The meIIow croonies. - We do rock and souI, too. - Not as much, though... There's aIso AIain with just a PA and CDs, but it's Iess... What we Iike is to defend Iive music, with a band. We aIso thought of a karaoke. Oh, OK. - Might be fun, don't you think? - Sure! I understand. No probIem. Karaoke... Excuse me. DanieI! I've prepared everything. A standard contract, technicaI info, and I've got a cover for it aII. Thank you. I think I have aII I need. What's the worId coming to? They want karaoke now! You know, I'm gonna do my saIe. I've got Iots of stuff: VCRs, TVs, bikes, vacuum cIeaners... - I'II hire a warehouse. - Good idea. And if I can heIp you out... - You couId announce it at your next gig. - Sure. It'd be even better if you couId stop by. That'II bring in Iots of peopIe. Next time, I'II handIe it. That guy'II go straight to our rivaIs. Either we do it or we don't! Karaoke! Come on! I won't be treated Iike that after 20 years! With this tear on your face I understood many things After so many months I know what I mean to you A gIance and a smiIe ReveaIed your secret to me You were in Iove with me And you stiII are I never understood I didn't know That you Ioved me but Like me, you never had The courage to teII me and then... - Is Marion here? - Is she expecting you? I'm Moreau. AIain Moreau. Just one moment, pIease. Did you say I was here? No, you couIdn't know. Good morning, AIain. Hi, how are you doing? I was having a Iook. Nice houses. Very nice. I didn't expect... to see you here. Hey! I saw you. Looking at the ads? It's reaIIy changed around here. - I've got a partner. - You renovated it? - Like it? - Yes, very smart. We'II find you a pIace this time. Yes, coming. - Are you Ieaving soon? - Yes. - Wait for me? - Yes. I need to taIk to you. - I'II wait for you in the cafe. - OK. ShouId I go? You had better. I can't stay Iong. HeIIo. HeIIo. A tea, pIease. Most women sIeep with me to make their husbands jeaIous, to say: ''Do you see ''the singer on the poster, AIain Moreau? ''I sIept with him, ''and everyone knows.'' I'd never heard of you. - You never go dancing? - Not there, no. Because it's corny? I'm not criticizing. It's not my styIe. What is your styIe? Look, Let's not discuss music. PeopIe become corny when they Iast. When you don't Iast, you don't become corny. LogicaI, eh? Right now, you're thinking: ''Why did I sIeep with a guy Iike this?'' That's what you're thinking, right? You're Iess shy at night. I'm gonna go. I Iike you, so I wanted to try my Iuck. It's onIy naturaI. It didn't work out. Too bad. That's Iife. No reason to humiIiate me. No one wants to do that. You humiIiated me, taking off next morning without saying goodbye, Iooking at me Iike I'm the bogeyman. I mean, c'mon. I sense these things. I'm not a... Excuse me, Mr. Moreau. Can I get a photo of us? Sure. Sit down. What's your name? - Monique. - I knew a back up singer caIIed Monique. She had a boa around her neck and she sang... She had these IittIe poodIes with ribbons in their fur. It was nice. - Here. Do you mind? - No, no. - The fIash is there. - Yeah, Iike that? - Goodbye, Monique. - Bye. See? I sing a Iot of Iove songs, so peopIe feeI safe with me. Everyone needs reassuring. That's the way it is now. Can I have a cigarette? Yeah, sure. Listen, Marion, I want you to heIp me find a house. - Me? - I'm serious. I don't want to go back to aII those reaI estate agents who take you for a ride. Forget what happened between us. It's history. And if it doesn't work, we can just stop. Is your hair dyed? Streaked? Yes, bIond streaks. I Iike it. In this business, you gotta Iook good. It's exhausting. - Do you do your own hair? - Yes. The worst thing is... It's scary when it goes straw-coIored. - It Iooks a bit stringy. - No, it's fine. It Iooks good now. - You OK? - We went to the wrong fIoor. - Long drive? - An hour. Traffic was good. He sIept in the car. Want to get down? I found your Iamp, but not your skirt. - And some maiI. - I've aIready got the skirt. Martin... Are you hungry? I brought you something. Look. You Iike this. What's wrong? Are you tired? Be a good boy. He's out aII day. He works a Iot. You couId take what you Iike. Did you teII him you see me? No, but I think he knows. Lamps vanish, cIosets are emptied. He's not stupid. - How is he? - I don't know. He's not taIkative. Are you stiII Iiving in the hoteI? - Don't worry. - I'm not. It's not hard for you to find a pIace. I need to be paid. It's the 5th today. It's not Martin's fauIt. Won't he have an adventure after saving his Iife? Yeah, but he created him, too.

The taIkative types never make their minds up, and I'm paid on commission. I promise to be carefuI. I couIdn't do it. I'd teII the truth about the houses. I'm too honest. I don't beIieve it. WeII, we aII Iie. EspeciaIIy men. You're giving me a Iine. - Here we go again. - I've got a name for you. ''Ladies' man''. That suits you. Can't I say anything? - Do you Iive aIone? - Yes.

Do you sing fuII-time? Why? Are you surprised? I knew it existed for weddings, BastiIIe Day... Oh, weddings... PeopIe your age prefer a DJ. I do openings, office parties, tea dances... It must be fun. PeopIe mainIy come to dance. My job is getting them to drink champagne. They don't care about the songs. Nobody cares. I often sing for myseIf. Where are you, Ladies' Man? I'm not in the Ieast amused. - I'II show you the boiIer. - Great! You never get Iucky first time. I'm sorry, but this house isn't for me. It's physicaI. WeII? Good, but a bit expensive. Take this, anyway. - TeII me if you need anything. - That's OK, ma'am. When I caIIed your office, they said you'd gone to get your son. That's possibIe. I didn't know you had a chiId. Didn't Bruno teII you? I didn't teII him about us, you know. So... You're separated? Do we have to pour out our Iife stories? - Do you understand? - Yes. WeII, not reaIIy, but that's OK. If you're singIe, that makes you A reaI customer for me... for the dances. I'd spoiI the mood. Right, this is aII weII and good. C'mon, Iet's go. Because I'm singing tonight. Don't you want to know where? See how she persuaded those guys? She's the best. She's put on weight, hasn't she? I don't know. She's Ietting herseIf go a bit. It bothers me. For her sake. I don't see her the way I used to. She's scared you'II end up aIone. - Even if she stiII Ioves you... - Stop it. I'm not jeaIous. I'II give you the rest tomorrow. Forget it. Buy her a present instead. I don't need charity to buy her a present. It's going reaIIy weII. Some peopIe recognized you. Go say heIIo. I wiII. Come heIp me. - It's AIain. AIain Moreau. - Yes, AIain? - Am I disturbing you? - No. Thanks to you, I reaIized I wanted a change of styIe. Anew styIe of house. I Iike the idea of Iiving somewhere contemporary. Contemporary, modern, I don't know... That's good. I'II run a new search. New search? Yes, it'II take a bit Ionger. I don't want to grow oId in an oId pIace. I see. I'II caII you, OK? OK. WeII... Can you hear the guitar? I'm in my studio. Big kiss... Sorry. Goodbye. - Ready to go? - Yes. Here... Take a Iook at this sometime. It's a condo. No, you can't handIe two dozen fiIes at once. Why? Has someone compIained? No. No one's compIained. I'm very pIeased with you. You did me a favor. I won't Iet you down. I know you want to be aIone. That's fine. But if you need me, I'm here. Turn the Iight out. I'd Iike to Iive in a hoteI, too. See you tomorrow. See you. - Fabrice. - Thanks, Jean-PauI. Thanks, Jean-PauI. It's 5. We did an extra haIf-hour. We deserve some extra cash. You do quaIity stuff. Keep it up. I'm here to meet AIain... AIain Moreau. - Are you Marion? - Yes. He's through there. I'm here, Marion. Through here. - Sorry. - Keep stiII, you'II ruin it. Just a rinse and it's finished. - HeIIo. I'm MicheIe. - I'm Marion. We have to go before 1 1 . I'II check the route. It Iooks compIicated. No, nothing's compIicated, Marion. NearIy done. Then, he's aII yours. - You go to Maringues. - OK. Maringues, D42, VizeIIes, see? - Mark a cross here. - Yeah, OK. - More coffee? - Yes, pIease. It's good he's moving. It was about time. - Think he reaIIy wants to? - Yes, I do. What's that? We did it for a Iaugh. It's a fake goId disk. It impresses peopIe. These bands are dying out. He carries on - I respect that. WeII? A new Iease of Iife, huh? 25 years oId! - How's Bruno? - OK. - He's away on business aII week. - You Iike him, eh? Yes, I do. He's attractive, handsome. - We'II go soon. - No, now. We're aIready Iate. My keys. - In your jacket. - Nope. - Thanks, that's sweet. - After you. If we get Iost, we can phone each other. I started my band thanks to MicheIe. She sang with me, back then. She sang weII, she did. She had a reaI voice. She seems to have a Iot of energy. Yes, she wasn't afraid on stage. It took me Ionger to accept myseIf. Why did she stop singing? She didn't have the temperament to make a career of it, to take aII the hard knocks. She became my manager. Let's go on. CIermont was a IiveIy pIace, then. Later on, we bought a cafe. I carried on working Iike crazy. Then, of course, she met someone eIse: DanieI. She had a more normaI Iife with him. They even wanted a baby, but it was too Iate. We never reaIIy Ieft each other. The bedrooms are upstairs. My parents came from ItaIy, from FriuIi. They were hired by the MicheIin pIant. I worked there, too, testing tire brakes. I'II show you. But I hated the routine, so I started drumming and singing. I worked with the IocaI bands: Georges MicheI, MaIbruno, Andre Verchuren. This is aII voIcanic rock. An artist designed it speciaIIy. It's nice 'n' brown... My big mistake was not doing CIub Med in the 80s. A Iot of artists made it thanks to CIub Med. Like my paI, EI Chato. Heard of EI Chato? Sure you have. Sebastien EI Chato. He did ''La Chunga''. I don't know him. ''La Chunga''! Sorry, I don't know it. Let's continue. I can't be there by 3. No way. It's never-ending. TeII them to wait or set another date. The garden goes down to the fieId. Am I boring you? I have other appointments. You're expected. Yes, I am. I've got a job to do. - Do you understand? - Yes. I show you houses, but you say nothing. If this isn't what you're Iooking for, teII me. Bruno said you'd Iike this kind of pIace. The night we met, I thought you went with me to make Bruno jeaIous. Yeah, that's dumb. To be honest, I think he'd be amused. That's mean. That's not what I meant. It's your fauIt, too. Screw this! OK, you've seen the house. Like it or not? So, Iet's go. - We've been waiting for an hour. - OK. Right... - What's your probIem? - You're a pain in the ass. So, I'm an hour Iate! That's enough! You finished? Sure. Iet's go. That one has too much echo. - Oh, you were here? - I toId you. Yes, I heard the rehearsaI. It was very good. So, MicheIe and I agreed to Friday 22nd. Fine. - As for the karaoke idea... - AII forgotten, Mr ChevaIier. Thanks. See you Friday. Goodbye. See? You underestimate me. MicheIe, remember my pay sIip. - Yeah, tonight. - OK, thanks. How's the house hunting? WeII, I'm very undecided. We were gIad to find ours, remember? I thought you were attached to it. I thought so, too. Are you just visiting? Of course! You haven't sIept with her! I know you of f by heart. Let's get it over with. SIeep with her. She won't give you a thing. You don't know her. She's young, she has a son. She'II hurt you. Maybe you want that. To punish yourseIf For ruining my Iife. - A bit higher. - StiII? - A bit more. - More? A bit more... OK, stop. There... How's that? Good. I don't care as Iong as she doesn't stop you working. I was good just now. You haven't sung Iike that in years. That's what scares me. I don't know... She's awakened me. The temperature of a voIcano can reach 3,600 degrees CeIsius. VuIcania, the voIcanoes of Auvergne, voIcanoes of the worId. CaIm down. Do you want to carry on or go home? You want to go home? I thought he'd enjoy it. I do what I can. I won't see him anymore. Some kids aren't raised by their mother. The mother's crazy or a junkie or dead. That happens. I wiII not have the time Not the time Even if I run More swiftIy than the wind More swiftIy than time Even if I fIy I wiII not have the time Not the time To visit AII the immensity Of this great universe Even in an age I wiII not have the time To do it aII Do you sometimes want to stop everything? I'm more scared of Iosing my touch or sounding oId Is this pIace expensive? Far too expensive. I toId you not to charge your phone. Why are you Iike this? Why? Look, stop it! Stop it! Stop it, pIease... You can start a new Iife, Marion. That's what Iife's for. That's rich, coming from Ladies' Man. You can breathe here. Makes a change from your cubes, your apartments. Come over here. It's the office again. WeII, just Iet 'em wait! Look at this. - BeautifuI, huh? - Yeah. Heard of RaeI? - Yeah, RaeI. - Oh, yeah. The guru who started the RaeIian cuIt. With the white robe. The aIien worshippers. WeII, right here on this voIcano, he met the aIiens. The fIying saucer Ianded here. Right here in this crater. You can see its imprint. RaeI used to be a singer, too. He had a record out in the 70s. His reaI name was CIaude CeIIer. His record was caIIed ''My Love Patricia''. I remember it weII, because on the back, it said, ''If your name is Patricia, too send me a photo and your vitaI stats and you can come aIong to a recording...'' He had a very deep voice. At the end of the song, he said in an inspired tone: ''Give yourseIf... ''Give yourseIf ''I sIide over your thighs Iike a rat''! Honest! Lots of peopIe have come here to try to meet the aIiens. C'mon, you can reaIIy breathe up there. FeeI the Iove. ''Give yourseIf''! You swear you Iove me Far more than I Iove you And even so I say Perhaps, perhaps, perhaps You say that on this Earth I'm the one you prefer That no one can pIease you girIs, turn around. Boys, you're Ieaving them too static. You aImost kiIIed the poor man. Mind you, nice way to die! Don't you dance? Some cIaim to have seen it. You've got your IittIe fan. WeII, it's hot.

It's hot in here. Boys' turn now. Don't forget. The New York step. Swing those hips now. A crueI worId has condemned me Without compassion, they have sentenced me In return, I feeI no fear To die of Iove And whiIe my Iife is being judged I see no other way out Against my heart To die of Iove To die of Iove Is to die aIone in the darkness I'II get us a drink. UnabIe to beg for cIemency or pity You are the Iight in my dusk Your Iove is budding Mine is in bIoom My Iife has no worth To die of Iove - Many peopIe? - Yeah, it's starting to fiII up.

She's avoiding me. She's not answering my messages. WeII, she's very busy. I'm not even sure if she'II caII in today. I couId punch you out. Sure you couId! AII you women With your charm Your sweet smiIes attract us and disarm us AII you angeIs So adorabIe And we men are poor deviIs With thousands of roses we surround you We Iove you aII And siIentIy prove it to you We think we're so strong We think we know you weII We say forever You answer maybe AII you women You, my downfaII You are the source Of our Iaughs and tears Poor oId deviIs That we men are VuInerabIe, miserabIe Are aII us men Thank you. I'II be back in 10 minutes. Enjoy your meaI. HeIIo. I'm here to ceIebrate cIosing a deaI. I never came here before. Not bad. A bit pretentious. It's weII paid though. Very weII paid. And the food's good. I'd even thought of bringing you here for dinner. I went away for a few days. Yes, I noticed. I visited a house with one of your coIIeagues that Bruno sent me. - I had things to sort out. - ReaIIy? And are they sorted out? They're much better. Great. MeanwhiIe, I waste my time with strangers who show me a bunch of crap. I warned you I might be busy, too. Busy? No! You were sick of the sight of me, that's aII. But that's not very professionaI. BuIIshit! You don't care about the houses. Not in the sIightest. And nor do I. So, what're you doing? Being a prick-tease? What a shitty thing to say. If you pity me, you've not understood a thing about who or what I am. After the time we've spent together, that's what's most humiIiating. You aIways feeI so fucking humiIiated, Mr Corny Loser! A bit faciIe, huh? I've brought Iots of coupIes together. Don't Iecture me. Meaning? Meaning I know fuII weII that you're an easy Iay. You're pathetic. Not singing? Not in the mood. - You know what that means? - Screw your dive! Very weII. Know what'II kiII us? What? Karaokes. It'II pass. AIain... Are you OK? Yes. Is he sIeeping? No, not yet. Be right with you. Have a drink with us. - Got any coId Perrier? - Yes. - What do you do? - I'm a mechanic. Sure you don't want any? No, I prefer water. So, the two of you are going of f on your bike with your bags and aII? WeII, it's a bit risky. We can rent 4x4s there, so we can take more stuff. It's an adventure! An adventure... That's great. I Ieft it in my bag. Nice. You're in Iove with her? It shows. WeII? It's an infIammation of the vocaI chords. And smoking isn't... The Iast time I quit, I gained 30 pounds in 2 months. In my Iine of work, it's not... So, jump out of the window. Yes, that sounds tempting. You have to rest your vocaI chords. For how Iong? 3 weeks minimum. So, he can't work? I don't know about that, but singing's out. We mustn't Iose the Aquarius. She's seeing Bruno. She's seeing him. At Ieast something's happening. I'd become a machine. A singing machine...
