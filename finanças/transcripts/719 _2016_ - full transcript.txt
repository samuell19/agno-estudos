Today. With Guillermo Ochoa, Lourdes Guerrero. MEXICO CITY SEPTEMBER 19, 1985 Seven in the morning, six minutes and 45 seconds, local Mexico City time. Last night, the governing board of the Autonomous University of Mexico failed yet again to come to an agreement regarding who will be appointed chancellor for the 1985-1989 term. The second work meeting started at 4:00 p.m. and ended at 8:40 p.m. Even though the meetings are confidential, it emerged that the 15 members of the governing board welcomed Mr. Jaime Martuscelli, the university's scientific research coordinator, and Mr. Daniel Resendiz, secretary of the National Board of Science and Technology, and former director of the Engineering Institute... There he is. -Good morning. -Elsita... -Martin. -Good morning. Good morning. Good morning. How are you doing? Good morning. Irmita. Good morning, Martin. Morning, Mr. Martin. I know what it feels like, getting to the office this early! Why aren't you training? They called us very early today, you know. Oh, but you've got to train. With some training, you can be like Juan Paredes or even Carlos Zarate. You are raving mad, Martin! I'd rather be like Zaragoza or Pintor. All of them bantam weights. No, bantam and super weights. It's not the same thing! A good bantam weight will succeed anywhere and an idiot will lose everywhere. And a dirty old man is a dirty old man everywhere, too! See you later, Mr. Martin. Yeah! What's up, Mr. Martin? Good morning. Goodbye, sir! -Good morning. -Good morning. Juan. -Good morning, sir. -Good morning. Take these folders to Mr. Landa Silva's office. Tell Lia, his secretary, that I sent them, okay? But sir... What? The thing is, Mr. Esquinca asked me to take these documents to the main administrative office before he arrived to the secretariat. Don't worry, I'll tell him you had to take Mr. Landa Silva's documents first. You'll do Esquinca's... Mr. Esquinca's errands later. -Yes, sir. -Do it now! Yes, sir. I'm on my way back. Juan. They gave me your rattle back, it's hopeless. I can't believe it. Good morning, Martin. Good morning, sir. Why are you still here? Well, you see, on the one day everyone is early, the other guy hasn't arrived. That's not right. Don't you have an envelope for me? Let me check. How's your arm? No, it's my leg. Oh, by the way... If you sign a form for me, I can get treatment at a public hospital. Of course. Fidel, please remind me to tell my secretary to write a letter for Mr. Martin. Yes, sir. Hmm? Go to the car and get me the paperwork for the chief secretary. It's a medium-sized envelope, it must be in the glove box. Yes, sir. Ouch! -Oh, honey! -Is she all right? Yes, thank you. Why do you wear those heels? Didn't you say we had to look smart? Monica, please. Look, I've known your mother my entire life, okay? Yes, I know. And you inherited her place. She gave it to you because she loves you. Because it's one of her assets. I know. And that's a lot, mind you. Having a position here is a big thing, it lasts for a lifetime. You'll never have to go looking. I'm not looking for anything. You think I can't tell? Can't you see how everybody looks at you? Those who look at you when you dress like that are not good for you. Hey, you're very young. Have some self-respect, girl. What? You wanna have kids already? Come on. Come on. Allow me. Careful. Good morning, sir. Good morning. Mr. Martin! Good morning, Ruth! -Here you are. -Thank you. How's your leg? Well, it gets stiff when I sit for long hours. And who's the young lady? I'm Monica Toledo, I work on the fourth floor. Oh, really? The fourth floor? Who do you work for, Miss Toledo? Um, well... She's helping me with the files. She's actually Mr. Compean's new secretary. Wow! Another big boss, right? No way, sir. He manages the archives. You are the big boss! Well... -We're going to work. -A pleasure. A pleasure, good morning. Oh, dear! It's an earthquake. Don't be afraid, it will pass. Don't be afraid, we're staying with you. Now, the time... It's seven in the morning, 19 minutes... You'd better leave the building, sir. Seven in the morning, 19 minutes... Slut! There are still a few tremors... Calm down, it will pass. Help me! Help! Help! This can't be happening to me. Help me! Help! Help me! Fuck! I'm trapped! No way! Help me! Help me! Help! Fuck... Martin, Martin... I'm Doctor Pellicer. I'm... I'm trapped. A beam fell on my legs. It hurts. Can you move, Martin? Does it hurt when you breathe? Doctor? Yes, yes. Doctor Fernando Pellicer. The lawyer? Yes, that's right. I'm a doctor. Are you in pain, Martin? Can you move? I can move my head a little. Oh, I can move my arms, too. I can't even get up. I'm... I'm here, with my desk. And? Can't you get out of there? Can't you come closer? You've got my flashlight there? Did you hear? Did you hear something? People have been screaming. Help me. I'm here! -Hang on, Martin. -Help me! Please, help me! Please, help me! Is there somebody out there? I'm stuck! Calm down. Calm down, Martin. Calm down! There's nobody! Shhh... Listen! Can you hear? It's the others. They're trapped here. Hmmm. They'll come soon. It won't take long. We're underground. This is an accident. This is an accident. Help! Help! Is there somebody there? It's Juan. -Mr. Martin? -Yes! It's me, Juan! Can you hear me? Ah, I'm stupid. Of course, he can hear me! Where are you? I don't know. I was on my way out of the elevator. I can't see anything. I tried to run, but something fell on me. I think the roof fell on us, Juan. I'm... at the elevator door. There were two more people with me. See if you can break free, Juan. No, don't move! Why not? Oh, God! Are you okay? Something went through me. I hadn't noticed. Don't move! Stay still, calm down. Take deep breaths, that you can do! Remember, don't move. That will ease the pain. Breathe. Can somebody hear me? Who is this? I'm Nadia Ramirez. I'm a cleaner. Say again? She's one of the cleaners. Nadia! Are you okay? Nadia, I'm a doctor! Can you move? Can you see anything around you? Anything? I can't see anything. Everything's dark. Where is my sister, Irma? She's a receptionist. Irmita, of course. She's not here, ma'am! Are you sure, sir? Irma! I have a flashlight, she's not here. Please, look more carefully. Irma! Calm down, Nadia. Calm down. Did you see the light? But where is she? Irma! I saw her, sir! I saw her. Where? Do you see her there? I saw her, sir! Nadia. If she doesn't answer, she probably fainted. We are stuck here, we can't see any further. Maybe, she isn't even here. Yes. Uh... Several people managed to leave. I'm sure she did. I'm sure they're trying to figure out a way to get us out of here now. Irma! Answer, please! Irma! Irma! Are you there? Irma! Can you hear me? Irma! There's nobody here either! Who is it? Carlos Diaz. Irma and I work on the same floor. You often say hello to me. I think I know you, too. I'm Martin Soriano, the guard. Carlos... Yes. Were you... near the entrance a while ago? No. I was one of the first people to arrive. I was on the fourth floor, I work here, I'm telling you. All the way to the fourth? Seriously? Yeah, why? We're on the ground floor. You fell down four floors. I've hurt myself real bad! Martin, he fell from the fourth floor. Everything fell down, the whole building fell on us. Seven floors crushed us. It was a very strong earthquake. Indeed. Worse than the one we had in 1957, when the angel statue fell down. You probably experienced that one, too. Didn't you, doctor? Doctor? What's wrong? Doctor? Doctor! What's happening? The whole building fell down! Calm down! On top of me! The fucking building fell on top of me! Calm the fuck down, doctor! What? Don't get upset. You're the big boss, we need you. We've got to get out. How the fuck are we going to get out? We have to hold on until they get us out, it's the same thing. Yes, they've got to get us out of here. Hey, I think it's true. We fell down. You sound so close! I'd heard more people a little while ago! They must have fainted, I don't know. Or maybe, they died. Shut up! Don't say that, ma'am! Did the others die? Maybe, I don't know. They can't hear us. They fainted or something. Help! Help! Please! Shut up, Juan. -Shut up. -I don't wanna die. Shut up! Shut up! -Don't you get it, boy? -I won't shut up! Calm down, you lot! We are alive! Some people might be dead, but... maybe others just fainted. Maybe they are being rescued, maybe... we will be rescued soon, too. We must hold on! Right, doctor? Doctor? It will take them a while to finish digging. We must be deep down below. Everything must have fallen down. There's a massive amount of debris, furniture... They have to move that first, before they find us. The whole building fell down on us. Let's see. I don't wanna die here. Mr. Martin, do you have a flashlight? Can we borrow it? We can't see anything. I'm too far. It fell near the doctor's hand, otherwise we wouldn't be able to see anything either. Besides, we are covered in debris, there is no way we can bring it to you. Well... If we can't move. Fuck! Hey, Carlos! What are you doing, Martin? There... Juan? Nadia! Carlos! Has any of you got anything? Some tool, anything. Not me. What am I supposed to have? I had my mop, but God knows where it is now. I have a radio! Really? Yes, a small one. It's small enough to fit in my pocket so that nobody steals it. It's in my blazer. I couldn't even take my blazer off. Just don't get mad at me, doctor. Huh? What? You told me off the other day 'cause I was listening to it. What do you mean? Did I tell you off? And now you don't remember! Is it within your reach, Carlos? Can you take it out? Yes. My hand is on... Let me see... I've got it! It's in my hand now. Turn it on, Carlos. What? Is it on now? Yes, it's been on for a while. We can't hear anything here. We must be way down. I've turned up the volume to the max! But it's a tiny radio. Let me see if I can find a station. It's hard, I can't see anything. You hear it? It's Jacobo on the news! Jacobo Zabludovsky? It sounds like it was pretty bad. Some buildings fell down. Others are damaged or have broken windows. My God! But some places fell down indeed. What do you mean "places"? Several buildings? So, it wasn't just this building? This one was stronger. Stronger than the other one you mentioned. They say another one is collapsing down on La Fragua street! Right now? They say it's a lot worse than they had anticipated. People are trapped in places that caught fire. Oh, my God! The Continental Hotel! But what do you mean places? How many? Which ones? They haven't specified, they are looking around the city. And the rest of the country? It can't be. Of course not, it's not Armageddon. No earthquake can be this strong. Well, it was strong and lasted a long time. No, but... The radio station, for instance, it's still working. No, it didn't fall down, surely! Listen, they were saying there are no emergency services. Some people are doing what they can, but... The police, the ambulance service and the fire brigade are not helping. They're not making it. What do you mean they're not? I don't know! Are you sure he said that? It's on the radio. I'm sure they said that, I mean... Some people are helping out, but... Maybe many buildings collapsed down indeed! I'm going to turn it off for a bit. To save some battery. We can turn it back on later. Me too! What are you doing? Nothing. 7:19. What? 7:19 in the morning. That's when the earthquake started. At 7:19. How do you know? That was the time. Don't cry, doctor. I'm not crying. I didn't say goodbye this morning. What? I didn't say goodbye to my daughter. Don't worry. She must be all right. I didn't want to wake her up. She was on her way to school when that happened, surely. How old is she? Five. Does she go to school already? Well, it's a kindergarten. I'm sure they are looking after her at school. I don't know her teacher's name. You'll see her soon. I didn't say goodbye. Don't cry, doctor. I said I'm not crying! Briefly summarizing what I've seen in Mexico City, the number of injured people is very high. We don't know how many people have died. This is the worst tragedy that the city has suffered in this century and perhaps, in its entire history... Hey! The number of fallen buildings... This seems to be the worst earthquake we've had. People are trying to help, but we've yet to hear anything from the police or the fire brigade. The Regis fell down. And that building where we used to have breakfast. The Supermilk? Yes, that one. They haven't mentioned this building yet? No. Hail Mary, full of grace. Our Lord is with thee. Blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus. Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us sinners. Now and at the hour of our death, Amen. Here... Here is... Doctor, can you hear that? I fell asleep. Listen. What? What's up? There's someone outside. What's that? Listen. -There's somebody. -What do you hear? -I hear voices. -Do you hear them? Mr. Martin... Here, yes... Yes? Who is it? Many thanks. Mr. Martin. I'm thirsty. I'm in a lot of pain. Hey! Hey, lady! Hey! What's happening? Thank you. What's happening? Wait, Juan! Hey! What do you see? What? Lady! Are you being rescued? Is Carlos with you? No, he's not here. I think he... He must be near Mrs. Nadia. I fell and hurt myself. It's... I don't know. Did I faint? I think you... I think you fainted. I thought we'd already heard everyone who was still alive. What's your name? I'm Dr. Pellicer! Els... Elsa Delfin, from the second floor. No! There is no Elsa on the second floor! The one on the second is Eloisa. Is that you, Elsita? Is that you? It's Eloisa, from the second floor! No, there's no Eloisa either! Yes, it's Elsa Delfin from the second floor. What's your name, ma'am? Say where you are. Do you hear me, ma'am? They're coming. They're coming? -Who? -Who's coming? -Who is it? -What? Do you see anything? No, nothing! Is there anybody there? I'm here! Ma... ma'am! Elsita, you must be above us. -Eloisa. -It's near a... Tell us what's going on, ma'am! Elsita? Is there anybody... Elsita? Her name is Eloisa! There is no Elsita, her name is Eloisa. Yes. She receives my paperwork. It's Elsa! -I know her. -Don't be stubborn, Juan. There is no Elsa! I take the paperwork to her office! It's me, Juan. Who are you talking to, Eloisa? -I'd thought... -Tell us! ...you wouldn't hear me. Turn the radio on, Carlos. Let's see if there's anything... They've come to rescue us! We're here! We're here! -Further down! -There is nobody! -Shut up, Juan. We can't hear anything. -Is there anybody there? Look carefully. Nadia, look carefully. She's alone. Here, please. There must be somebody! Please! There's nothing in the news about this place. I don't know who... Who else... There is nobody! Nobody's coming to rescue us! Elsita, can't you hear... Is that you? Elsita! There is no Elsa, for God's sake! Ma'am, do you see light? Do you see the light? Do you see the light, Elsita? Can you hear us? Do you see the light? Who is it? There is nobody. No one's coming. Light? Do you see light? Yes, I can see the light. They're calling us! Can you see anything, Juan? No, I see nothing! And you, Mrs. Nadia? Me neither. No one is coming to get us! -Listen. -Yes, there is light. Tell them we're down here. We're down here! We're deep down! Help! Shut up, will you? ...the angels... What did they say? Did they say anything? What? Ma... Ma'am, Juan, Carlos, did they say anything? Do you see them? Dad? Mom? Oh, no. -What? -What's happening? No, no, no, she's... She's delirious. I'm sure it's a concussion or... Or she's just waking up, but she's delirious. I told you! I told you. I don't know. Nobody's coming. What if she's not delirious? What if she's being rescued? No, no... It's not that, it's... She's... She must have had a concussion. I don't remember the song. There's no one with her. Nobody's gone that far down. But what if? I don't remember The Angels' song. Which one? Which song is that? Why? Are you not gonna let me through if I don't know the song? Is that permanent? Something similar happened to my gran, she had for a year. Yes... Oh, Juan! Well, I'll sing another one. It's just that... Sing another one, Elsita! I've got a rock on my head. There... Sing another one and it'll be fine. Just try to remember. I remember one. ♪ Mary, mother Mary ♪ What are you doing, doctor? Elsita? Hey, is her name Elsita? That was her name. Carlos! You'd better... turn the radio on, Carlos. Elsita! I'm gonna put new batteries in, doctor. Before the ones it's got die out. The light has gone dim. How are you gonna give them to me? If I don't put them in now, I'll never be able to. If they fall far from you, you will at least see where they are. Fuck! I've got it. Can you hear me, Elsita? No. Fuck! Fuck, you threw them way too far. She died, didn't she? I can barely move. You shouldn't have thrown them at me. -I threw them good! -No, you didn't. We're all gonna die. Thank God I threw them at you because I could have kept them. You should have kept them, at least they wouldn't be wasted. We're gonna die of hunger or thirst! Please, give me some light! Shut up, Juan. Shut up, Juan, for fuck's sake! Now the battery is lost in the rubble and we'll run out of light, thanks to you! How can you say shit like that? Hey, what's wrong with you? I'm scared, I'm in pain! I never wanted this fucking messenger job! Don't fuck with me, Juan! You know what? I never wanted this fucking job either! Forty years! Thirty-five years before the doctor was transferred from the old building. Forty years! Being treated like dirt, earning peanuts. And two weeks before my retirement, two weeks before I took my TV home, so that I would never come back here... You have no idea. You have no idea... what it feels like. Besides, I'm worse off than you. You'll get better as soon as you come out. We all wanna get out. We're all trapped. Just like you. We're all hungry and thirsty, and we're all scared. Screaming is of no use. What do I do, then? Why are you still asking me? Hang in there! We must hang in there. There's nothing else to do. You're alive, we're alive, too. Get some rest. Close your eyes. And say something, so that you don't fall asleep. Tell us some story. Juan. Juan! I don't want to speak. Well, you've gotta say you don't want to speak. We can't see you, so we're not sure whether you're throwing a tantrum or not. All right, then. I didn't know you worked at the other building. Yes, the one on Bucareli Street. Then you knew my brother? Yes, I knew him. I don't know why we moved to a different building. The other one was closer to home and the arena. Actually, I do like coming here. To the new building? To work, I like coming to work. There's no one home. I'm always on my own. Everybody knows me here. At least there's people to talk to. And your family? They left a long time ago. Where to? At least you've got your daughter. I've only got my boxing matches and my TV. I don't want to retire, doctor. Let me see what I can do. Thank you, doctor. See, Mr. Martin? You do like your job. And I hate being here. Is there somebody there? Can anybody hear me? Is there anybody there? Speak out, please! - Do you hear that? - Can anybody hear me? Yes, Juan. Can you hear that? Juan, what do you hear? Get us out of here! -Hey! We're down here! -Down! Hey! Doctor? Are you okay? What's going on? We'll get you out! We're here! Martin, Martin... Martin, they're here! Calm down, sir. Don't worry. They're coming to help us, Carlos! They're coming! -Help! -Here! Martin. We're down here! Help us! We're getting out. They came to rescue us, Martin. -We're down here! -Here! There's five of us alive. We're five! Help! Here! Down here! We're five! Down here! We're down here! We're here! Please, get us out! Here! We're five! We're alive here! We're down here! Help, please! Help! Down here! Tell them, daddy, tell them! Doctor, are you all right? Did he die? No, he's not dead. What happened to him? He lost the flashlight. I didn't lose anything. It rolled down, I didn't do anything. You lost the flashlight and left it on. Is your flashlight still working? Well, yes. But since the doctor lost the flashlight and left it on, we'll soon be left in the dark. You know batteries run out, don't you? I didn't lose anything, it just rolled down! How can it just roll down? You lost it. End of story. If we're left in the dark, it is all your fault. Well, we're even then. -Even, you say? -Yes. You lost the batteries, I lost the flashlight. Don't talk crap, doctor! What's wrong with you? You don't know who you're talking to! I'm talking to the moron who left us in the dark! What? What's wrong with you? I'm still your boss, even if we're down here! Hey! Stop fighting! Well, he is the doctor who left us in the dark. Don't complain, Mr. Martin. We've been in the dark since the earthquake started. You never gave us any light. Hey. What, Juan? I'm very thirsty. Hang in there, Juan. They can't take much longer. They've said that digging has started. When did they say that? A little while ago. I tried to tell you, but no one listened to me. Look, see if there's anything near you. Anything within reach that may be used as a container. What for? Try to find one. There are glasses nearby. They're all broken, but one of them is fine. I can see some more bits and pieces. There's an ashtray here. But it's flat, is it any good? I don't know, maybe. We can drink our own urine, in order to survive. -You should try that. -What? No fucking way. A sergeant said the same thing when I was in the army. You can do that to survive, if there is no water. It's disgusting. Particularly when it's all foamy and... Yuck! Hey. Listen. Listen, please. I don't have anything I can use to drink my own urine, but those who can should give it a shot. You'll live for a longer time. It's easier to die of thirst than to die of hunger. Oh, no... No... No, I won't drink anything. Fuck! There. Fuck! Believe it or not, Mr. Martin, I'm jealous of you. I'm gonna throw up. Ma'am? How horrible. Well done, Mrs. Nadia. I'm jealous of you, too. Doctor? Remember how I threw the batteries at you? You mean, how you lost them? Oh, give me a break! I can lend you my cup. Get ready and I'll do it. Very well, Mr. Martin. You can throw after all. Hey, you didn't clean it up. What could I clean it with? Me, your servant? Thank you. Watch out for the boa, otherwise you'll be traumatized. You have to give it back, okay? Otherwise... Shit! What? Did you drink it? What does it taste like, doctor? It's coming again! Fuck! Nadia? Juan? Carlos! Can you hear me? Can you hear me? Doctor? Juan? Carlos? Nadia! Answer me! I'm here! Carlos? Juan? Juan, are you okay? I'm here! Carlitos! Carlos! Carlos? Carlos. Carlos! Calm down, doctor! -Are you there? -Carlos! -Carlos. -Carlos! Oh, no! Doctor! Do you see the light? They're rifts. They're the rifts. Huh? Juan! Nadia! There's a light! There's light! Light? Did you say light, Mr. Martin? You mean lamps, Mr. Martin? No, it's light. Sunlight. Filtering through the rubble, it's light! They're coming to get us out. It's all my fault. It's all my fucking fault. What are you saying, doctor? Nobody would have come at seven in the morning two days ago. But I summoned everybody. I did because... the chief secretary said he'd make a surprise visit. I'm responsible. It's all my fault. It's all my fucking fault and here I am. Stuck underground. Hey. At least 200 people must be dead now. I wonder how many people are trapped here and we can't hear them. Calm down. Calm down, doctor. There's light, they're coming. No one could possibly have known. I mean, how was this supposed to happen? It's the worst earthquake we've had in this country. If instead of having it three days ago, we'd had it any other day, five or six people would have died. How were you to know? I should have known, fuck it! Of course not. What's wrong with you? What's wrong with me? Well, I'm here trapped under God knows how many tons of rubble, in a building from which I unlawfully made millions of pesos. It was built by my father-in-law's building company and I helped him get all the permits. I approved the budget. I got my share of the money that motherfucker stole by using cheap, third-grade materials. The architects told him it would hold, that it was okay. I'm not an architect, I don't know how you assess that. And I couldn't care less. How could I know that one day we'd have this earthquake? Right, because we never have earthquakes in Mexico City! How could you possibly envision that? Are you happy now? Don't screw with me, Martin! You don't understand! And what do you expect us to understand? It's not like you don't have enough money already! Pack of thieves! What do you care? It's public money! Don't be a shameless bastard! I wasn't aware you'd done that. I mean, there's a lot of other things... Everybody knows who you are! Well, everybody knew! 'Cause now, most of them are dead. And it's your fault! Hey, what's wrong with you? Why do you always do that? Why do you always steal everything? Didn't you hear? I feel responsible. It's of no use to me! It's of no use to Mr. Soriano, who was about to retire. It's of no use to the dead. Cunt, slave-monger, thief! Much more comfortable to sit down all your life until you retire, right? Waiting for us to hand feed you. There, in your stinky desk. Your fucking father's stinky! And so is the father-in-law whose ass you kiss! It's better than working your ass off! I can aspire to better things and won't spend my life depending on a filthy pittance. Fuck off! You fuck off, motherfucker! When they get us out of here, I'm going to bust your fucking ass! Aww. When they get us out of here, he'll heal well at a U.S. hospital. As if nothing had ever happened. That's the way it is, that's the way it's always been. Perhaps, he'll even get a promotion! Maybe the chief secretary died in one of these buildings. and needs to be replaced by someone else. I want my cup back, motherfucking thief! Look for it, it may be near the batteries! Wuss. Useless piece of shit. Moron. I'm not the worst of them. There are officials above me who are way worse! Do you guys watch soap operas? I do, Mr. Martin! Why? Many politicians in Mexico City. Legislators, secretaries, governors. I like Jose Jose. I like listening to The Bukis. My father-in-law is the worst of them all. He's a motherfucking corrupted bastard, but won't die! Get out of town! You don't believe me, do you? That cunt did the same thing in at least three more buildings. ♪ My loneliness ♪ ♪ There are so many Misfortunes killing me ♪ They run Over each other ♪ And, as they try To kill me ♪ They pile Upon each other ♪ And that's why They can't kill me ♪ ♪ Oh, loneliness ♪ Happiness, where is it, I wanna find it ♪ I like this younger singer. Yes, Emmanuel! I love to see him. No, I hate that one. Yes, I like that song of his, the one that goes... Calm down, Nadia! I've just remembered. My favorite song of his is the one that goes: "Everything collapsed..." What are you doing? Don't be childish. Are you giving me the silent treatment like a schoolboy? Talk to me, what are you doing? Do you like cigarettes? What? Do you smoke? Not regularly, but... I do treat myself on occasion. Why? Do you like the occasional big cigar? Is that a double entendre? Not at all. I like Cuban cigars. The originals from Havana. And where do you get those? Are they illegal imports? Of course not, I can get them directly from Cuba. I only smoke local cigars. It's what one can afford. Boy, do I remember when they went up from 70 cents to $1.50. What a mess! What are you doing? What are you looking for? Look, I'm talking to you because I can't kick you out. We have to coexist. You should have thought about that before making this cheap-ass building! I had a lighter, but God knows where it's gone. But if I had it, I'd be smoking my cigarettes. And now what? Well.

And further South, on San Juan de Letran Avenue, the scene is devastating. It's as if a bomb had exploded. The earthquake that took place at 7:19 in the morning, measured 7.3 on the Richter scale... The Red Cross has not received reports of people trapped in the metro lines, there isn't any news on.

This morning's earthquake, today's earthquake has stung us the deepest way, it's a wound that has been bleeding nonstop for the past four hours.
