This is probably a mistake. Lately I seem to specialize in mistakes, and this trip is probably no different. Not that I had anything better to do. Saturdays in L.A. were nothing special. Sunday through Friday was even worse. Maybe one drink. Maybe two. Maybe three and get back on the plane to L.A. Well, no. I got this far. Hey, somebody else is in there. You mind sharing a ride? Yeah, I mind. Thought I'd ask. It's their money but you'd save a couple of bucks. I still mind. Where to? Castle lodge on the Nevada side. I know where it is, but it ain't open. Gaming commission closed it down about a week ago. You better try someplace else. Everything's going to hell. You know that. I think I'll buy a cabin in the mountains and never come down. You're a cop, ain't you? No, I'm not a cop. Baloney, you're not a cop. Not that it makes any difference to me, mind you. But I can tell. Here we go, pal. Good-bye, California. Hello, Nevada. Those guys at castle lodge-- if I were you, I wouldn't trust any of them. What do you care what I think, huh? Not much. Don't get snotty, mister, 'cause I don't care about your tip. You see, I speak my mind. Besides, you're a cop. Cops are lousy tippers. The man said he wanted to discuss something of a confidential nature. "Confidential to who?" I asked. "You'll be paid for your time." "Why me?" I wanted to know. "What's it got to do with me?" "Look, buddy, somebody wants to do you a favor." I couldn't even remember the guy's name. Hey, you're schillman, right? I'm smiley cappell. I'm sorry I couldn't get down to meet you. Here. I'll take care of this. Some place, huh? Why don't you take a look around if you want? I'll take your bag inside. Cops are lousy tippers, but crooks, they do it big. See you around, pal. Mr. Charnock's tied up right now, but I let him know you were here. That's alright. I'm in no hurry, mister... Smiley. Everybody calls me smiley. What does everybody call you? My name is Harold. Yeah, but I mean what does everybody call you--schill? Sometimes. Well, you came to the right place. Let me see if I can find a room for you. Lord knows we got plenty of them. Thank you for coming, Mr. Schillman. Believe me, I appreciate it. Especially since I couldn't tell you then why I wanted you to come. I hope it was no inconvenience. No. I wasn't doing anything important. Please. I know exactly what you were doing. I know quite a lot about you, Mr. Schillman-- that you were a good cop and an honest one. I'm not a cop anymore. I'm aware of that. I also know the circumstances which led you to resign and the events which followed. That's a nice way to put it. I was fired. Look, Mr. Charnock, I tried to kill myself, except I missed. I spent three weeks healing in San Diego general. Then the court sent me to the vacaville medical facility for 90 days' psychiatric examination. You mind if I walk around a little? Not at all. After you were released from vacaville, you moved to Los Angeles, where you went to work for the credit finance corporation, repossessing cars by day and drinking yourself into a stupor at night. You've been picked up a number of times for drunkenness by the l.A.P.D., but never booked. Professional courtesy. You've done a lot of work, but I think you wasted your time. Why don't you hear the problem before you decide? Okay. The Nevada state gaming commission claims to have evidence that a skimming operation was going on in this casino-- sufficient evidence to close US down. My license has been suspended-- something the commission does not do lightly. Is it true, this skimming? No. It wasn't skimming. Money was being taken illegally, but I knew nothing about it. Except they suspended your license. Because it's my responsibility. This casino runs on my license and my reputation. The commission closed US down 11 days ago. The next day, my wife disappeared. That's why I contacted you. I want you to find her. Do you think she was involved? I don't know what to think. I only know that she's gone, and I don't know where. She may be in trouble. She may need my help. That's my wife. Her name is Caroline. Why me? Because I think you can find her. A failed cop... A failed suicide... Even a failed drunk. I don't buy it, Mr. Charnock. The police would ask questions. A private investigator might get carried away. I can't afford that. I don't want any questions, Mr. Shiillman. I just want you to find my wife, let me know where she is. And watch her until I get there. I'll pay you $10,000, and you'll forget that it ever happened. $10,000. She left in her car, headed for San Francisco. It's a white rolls Royce convertible with Nevada plates. That shouldn't be too difficult to trace. I own an apartment in San Francisco. Caroline spent a good deal of time there. I'll have a car for you in the morning. How are you? Water's warm if you want to take a dip. No, thanks. I got the steam room fired up. Maybe you'd like to have a nice sweat, little rub-down massage. You'll feel like a million bucks. Thanks just the same. If you change your mind, pick up any of the phones and ask for Rudy. That's me. The girls will know where to find me, day or night. 24-hour service. I'm impressed. And they say good help is hard to find. Oh, it is. Take my word for it. It was a joke. I don't like jokes. You're a friend of Mr. Charnock's. You get what you want when you want it. What do his enemies get? That's not real funny, either. Three days on the wagon was making me irritable. I felt like damaging the white t-shirt, but the L.A. flight was already gone. That left me with nowhere else to go. I guess he just doesn't feel sociable. Yeah. He just doesn't want to intrude. There's nobody in the whole world like Carl charnock. Let me tell you. When you get to know him better, you'll know what I mean. I'll take your word for it. Don't. That's one thing I don't kid about. Why do you think he hired you? 'Cause he heard you were a good guy who needed a break. He mentioned a few other reasons, too. Listen... You tried to bump yourself off, right? Now see, that means something to char. You might say, he's got a feeling for that because he knows what it's all about. His first wife ruthie... You know how many times she tried? Eight. He had her watched around the clock. He'd drive her to the hospital, get her pumped out. He lived with that for years. So what finally happened? Ruthie... She finally did it. But I'll tell you something, he always loved her. He never stopped. That was 10 years ago. See what I mean? And, uh, what about the second Mrs. Charnock? Caroline? He married Caroline two years ago. Surprised the hell out of all of US. He never even told me about it. But if it makes him happy, that's all that matters. You don't like her. What? Come on. No, no, no. Caroline is a... Caroline's a high-class lady. Her and me, well, we just don't talk the same language. Could she have anything to do with the stealing? Now you sound like a cop. You were hired to find her, schill, not to find out. Remember that, why don't you. Oh, ho ho. Company's here. Hello, smiles. Let's go. Hey, fay. You're looking beautiful. Just beautiful. This is the guy I was telling you about. I'd like you to meet a friend of mine Harold schillman. They call him schill. This is lady fay Reid. Hi. Hi. Well, do I pass, or do I just get by? You'll do. Since you two seem to be hitting it off, I've got some business to attend to. See you later, fay. I could use a drink. What's it going to be tonight, folks? Rob Roy, on the rocks. Rob Roy. How about you, Mr. Schillman? Oh, hell. Let me have a beer. Okay. Is it always that hard, working your way down to a beer? I don't know. I haven't been trying it for very long. Does it show that much? I've seen worse. You from Vegas? Is that what smiley told you? Just guessing. Bad guess. I live in L.A. I used to live there, but I left right after the big earthquake. Were you there? I heard about it. Yeah, everybody heard about it, but I was sitting right on top of it. But that did it for me. I thought the whole world was coming to an end, so I just left. Good-bye and the hell with everything. I just got in my car and headed north. I was that scared. And now? I like it here. No smog, no traffic, and no earthquakes. Come on. Let's see if you have any gambler's luck. It's on the house. My pleasure. Thanks. Here. Go ahead. No, you go first. I already know my luck. Good or bad? It gets by. Go ahead the machines. Tell all. I hope not. Oh. Heh heh. Welcome to the club. You're sure in a hurry, aren't you? I like to get it over with. Winning is something you do slow so you can enjoy it, but losing, I do it as fast as I can. Is that how it's done? Yeah. Why? Haven't you been doing it right? I guess not. You feel better? Much. How about some Blackjack? What will we play for? Love. That way everybody loses. Let me have your room key. Give me a couple of minutes. Come on in. The water's fine. I finished your drink. Congratulations. You know, nothing's going to happen. That's what they all say. I really mean it. It's been a long time, and I... Well, I'd rather not talk about it. Okay. Other than that, it's been swell. Can I spend the night? I don't want to go home. Why? I don't want to be alone. I won't bother you. Besides, I'm a quiet sleeper. And I'm a nice person. That's $1,000 in expense money. You can count it if you want. I could never do it like you do. Mr. Charnock's private number. Call him collect, anytime, day or night. Mr. Charnock's address in San Francisco-- the apartment. The car's out front. The key's are in it. Anything else? If there is, you'll hear from me. Hey. How'd it go last night? Beyond your wildest dreams, smiley. Beyond your wildest dreams. No taxi yet? No taxi yet. Well, I could give you a lift. [Fay] How far are you going? [Schillman] San Francisco. You could drop me in vallejo. It's on your way. It's just before you get to Oakland. What's in vallejo? My sister. And my kid. How would you get back? Oh, somebody will give me a lift. That's no problem. You married? Not anymore. Kids? No. My little boy's 10 years old. Wesley Jordan Reid. That's some fancy name for a kid. His father was an actor. That probably explains it. Sebastian Reid. You ever hear of him? He did a couple of pictures and worked in television a lot. What does he do now? He teaches meditation and self-hypnosis. Sounds phony, huh? It's a living. That's what you think. He's always broke. He hasn't paid me a dime of alimony, but we had fun. That's what counts. Yeah, that's what counts. Listen, if you want me to be quiet, just say it, but don't cut me up, okay? Sorry. It just came out that way. You remind me of my first husband Joe. I was 17 when we got married. How many husbands have there been? Just two-- Sebastian and Joe. Joe hervey. We're still friends. All three of you? Oh, go stuff it. The traffic caught US outside Sacramento, and seeing as we didn't have much to say, fay curled up and went to sleep. That gave me plenty of time to think. Except I still didn't know what I was getting into. Vallejo! Vallejo! You're home. Oh. Oh, yeah. Okay. Well, uh... Thanks for the ride. Well... Oh, listen. Uh...here. Here's the number... In case you don't have anything better to do. Wesley! Hi, honey. Hi. Mrs. Charnock just get in? She's expecting me. In the garage? Yeah. She's thinking about selling the rolls. I'm thinking about buying it. You don't look like someone that buys a car like this. You look like a cop. You know that's a funny thing. You're the second guy in two days who's told me that. Then we're both right, me and the other guy. You take care of Mrs. Charnock's car while she's in town, don't you? It would be worth 20 bucks to find out what kind of shape it's in. Car's in good shape. She just get in? It ain't worth it, buddy. You know it. You know, you're right. She'll probably tell me herself for nothing. Hey, that's a private elevator, buddy. That's okay I don't mind. I told myself the car could have been in the garage for the past 11 days, but somehow that didn't seem right. And if Caroline was in the apartment, then nothing would make sense. I had one more chance to climb out of the hole I had been in for over a year, maybe my last chance. It made me nervous. [Knock knock] Mrs. Charnock, my name is schillman. Your husband hired me yesterday. He wanted me to find you. He thought maybe you'd... Now that you've found me, Mr. Schillman, why don't you come in. Have a seat. Thank you. So my husband hired you to find me. Yes. He was worried about you. Hadn't heard from you. Didn't know where you were. Carl told you this... Personally? That's right. I spoke to my husband this morning. He called at about 10:00. However, he didn't mention anything about you. Well, he must have had an awful lot on his mind. Carl has known exactly where I've been since I left the lodge. I speak to him every day, usually more than once a day, and he didn't say anything about hiring you. How do you explain that, Mr. Schillman? Why don't we call Mr. Charnock and let him explain it? My husband has been under a lot of pressure these past days... Terrible pressure. I'm sure you know all about it. Yes. The commission suspended his license. Would you like to make that call now? Oh, Carl's reputation, his whole life depends on the outcome of the commission hearings. The anxiety is unbearable, and when you consider his behavior in that light... How much is he paying you to find me, Mr. Schillman? A lot of money. And you did it so quickly. Well, Carl is a very generous man. He'll pay you whatever he agreed to, but I'm sure you can understand the importance of keeping this episode entirely confidential. I hope you can assure me of that. Oh, sure. I have no one to talk to. Nice place. Yes, it is. So why don't you go home, Mr. Schillman, and forget all about this? Your check will be in the mail within the week. I promise you. [Schillman] Yes, I'm in San Francisco. I found your wife. Yes, I'm sure it's her. What are you doing, playing games with me? She told me she talked to you this morning, she talks to you every day, sometimes twice. She said you knew where she was all the time. She wanted me to go home and forget about the whole thing. You better get down here. You're welcome, Mr. Charnock. Son of a gun, this is some mess. So...what do you think, Harold? About what? What do you think about what? About this. You saw the whole thing, right? You're an eyewitness. I saw her fall. And you're the only one, Harold. So what do you think? About what? Harold, don't start that again. I don't want to hear that anymore. I want to know what you think. You think she fall? You think she jumped? You think she was she pushed? I wanna know what you think? I don't know, inspector... Carmona. Inspector carmona. And you remember that. Now, Harold, you got to think something. Let's see. You come here. You talk to the guy in the garage. Then you come up here and talk to the lady. Right. Then after you talk, you go downstairs... And minutes later, you look up, and here she comes. What did you say to her, Harold? Look, inspector... Carmona. I know-- inspector carmona. I can remember your name. You can remember mine. Mr. Charnock will be here in a little while. I'll talk to him before I talk to you. No, Harold. That's not right. You're not a lawyer. You're not a priest. You're not a doctor. You're not even a licensed p.I. You got no privileged conversations. But that's the way it is. Obstruction of justice. Harold, that could put you in the caboose. All I'm asking for is a little time, inspector. I owe Mr. Charnock that. Harold, you see that shoe? That shoe gives me a lot of trouble. You know why? Because she wasn't wearing it. If the lady had been wearing both shoes when she hit, then I wouldn't have so much trouble. You know how many steps it is from that shoe to the edge where she went off? Seven, and I got small feet. You think she walked seven steps with one shoe off? I don't know. I know you don't know, Harold. I am asking you what you think. I think I should wait until Mr. Charnock gets here and talk to him. I'm going to have your buns, Harold, if you give me any more problems. You know... I'm 34 years old... A minority race, and a homicide inspector. Now you know all about me. Fair enough? Tell me about you. Who are you, Harold? I already told you. Details. You didn't give me any details. Like, you look at me, you know my name is carmona. You think I'm Mexican. Wrong. I'm Cuban. What's a Cuban doing in San Francisco? I didn't like Miami. Now, come on, Harold. Harold schillman, anglo-Saxon protestant. Last employer-- credit finance company, Los Angeles. Okay? Distinguishing marks. You didn't say anything about distinguishing marks. How'd you get that one? From a gun, inspector. .38 caliber. Hurt. Inspector? [Siren] Mr. Charnock, I'm inspector carmona. Somebody here would like to speak to you. Just wait here. Harold. I'm sorry, Mr. Charnock. I'm very sorry. Yes. Thank you. This is the eyewitness, Mr. Charnock. Do you know him? Yes. He doesn't want to talk to me until he talks to you. That's alright. You hear that, Harold? He says that's alright. I'd like to speak with Mr. Charnock privately. I'm going to give you exactly 10 seconds, but that's all. What shall I tell them, Mr. Charnock? Do you want me to wait? Shall I keep quiet? Maybe you can tell me what's going on around here? Did she jump? I don't know. It looked like it. Why? I don't know, Mr. Charnock. The only thing I do know is that this is making me sweat. And I don't like to sweat. What shall I tell them? The truth. Okay. The easy way would have been to go along with whatever story the police wanted, but $10,000 bought a lot of loyalty. If charnock wanted me to tell the truth, I'd tell the truth. Simple. Except I didn't know what the truth was. Think he'll be alright alone? No. I offered to fly up with him. Maybe sometimes it's better to be by yourself. Maybe. What are you going to do? I'll drive back up to Tahoe in the morning. They're going to need you for the inquest. You've got my statement. Maybe they want to ask some questions. Maybe I want to ask some questions. I need answers. You're all I got. That ain't much. I'll tell you what you call me in the morning. Where're you going to be? I dunno, I'll find a place. Well, you call me. You call me or I'll come find you. And take my word for it, Harold you wouldn't like that. This carmona is trying to hang a murder on me. Have I been set upas the biggest patsy in the world? Fay? Fay, this is schillman. I thought maybe you'd like to finish that drink. Yeah. I remember what you said-- nothing better to do. Neither have I. The, uh, red rooster inn... On mission road. Don't worry. I'll find it. 9:30 is good for me. Yeah, I'm glad I called, too. [Soft jazz playing] [Cash register rings] What happened to fighting the good fight? Or is that just ginger ale? Brandy and soda. And what are you having? Try to remember. Hi. Hi. A Rob Roy on the rocks for the lady, and I'll have another of these. You're really going to do it, huh? It just might be possible. Did you have a nice day? You didn't. Was little Sebastian or whatever his name is happy to see his mother? Wesley. Sure. He's always happy to see me. We had a terrific time how's your sister? My sister's fine. You're really in trouble, aren't you? No. Just making conversation. Um...you want to tell me what happened, or am I supposed to guess? You are supposed to sit there and be friendly and drink your drink. I'm friendly. Now what? I'm driving back up tomorrow. You want a ride? Sure. Short visit. Long enough. Just tell me if you're in trouble. No trouble. The job I was working on just didn't work out well. That's all. Oh, for Pete's sake! It's Joe, my first husband. Good old Joe. Joe! So, how's my baby? What are you doing here? I was just passing through. I was going to call Gloria tomorrow morning, see if you were in town. You're looking really good, faithy. Really good Joe, I want you to meet a friend of mine. Harold schillman, Joe hervey. Harold. How are you? I don't want to use up any more of your time. I'll give you a call in the morning at Gloria's. You are staying there. Yeah, not too early. Okay. Nice meeting you. I'm sorry. I didn't even know he was in town. Where is he usually? L.A. Joe keeps moving. That's nice. You didn't like him. Not particularly. Who's Gloria? Your sister? Uh-huh. Why did you want to see me tonight? Well, I guess it was my turn not to want to be alone. You and me, we have a history now. Well, I like you. Is that enough? Where are you staying? In a motel down the road. Let's go there. Why? We'll get a bottle. It's cheaper. And it's private. Come on. Just a little bit of heaven. Or somewhere. Relax. Make yourself at home. Glasses are in the bathroom. Motels are funny that way. She talks. She laughs. She mixes drinks. She does it all. You look pretty pleased with yourself. No. But I am glad that you're here. And if I wasn't? I'd feel a lot worse than I do now. What happened today? Tell me. Was it that bad? Caroline charnock killed herself. I saw it happen. Dead? My god! Dead. How? She went off the terrace. Straight down. She killed herself. Oh, it's been done. But Caroline charnock? Did you know her? Yes, I knew her. She sure was pretty. Rest in peace. I'm sorry. I didn't know you were friends. I wouldn't have, uh... Not friends. I knew her, that's all. You're going to be staying up in Tahoe? No. I'll just go and give them their car back and finish things up. Then what? I don't know. Back to L.A., I guess. Why? Why not? Is your wife in L.A.? Uh, your ex-wife? No. You never see her? I never want to. It was bad, huh? No, it wasn't bad. It...really wasn't much of anything. Then it turned to garbage, to filth. Wow! I really pushed the right button there. No buttons. I mean, uh, forget it. Okay. Did she walk out on you? No. I walked in on her. You mean with another guy? That's right. Right in the middle of it. I came home one day while I was on duty. I never did that before. There they were in my bed. She was looking at me over his shoulder. She's screaming because I had the gun out. Pointed it right at her. He's rolling off onto the floor like he's trying to hide, so I pointed it at him. She's still screaming. So I pointed it back at her. I knew I was going to kill somebody. I just couldn't decide who. It turned out to be me. You tried to kill yourself? The bullet bounced off. Lousy angle. Why didn't you shoot them? Why didn't you shoot her? Why you? I don't know. Doctor-- psychiatrist at vacaville-- kept asking me that. He kept asking me why I went home that day, kept trying to get me to admit that I knew I'd find them, that I was trying to catch her, that I wanted it to, that I wanted it to happen. Well...maybe he was right. But you don't feel that way now. You wouldn't do it again. Lady, I don't feel any way now. I wouldn't let you. I'd never let you. [Shower running] Uh. Yeah. I'd like to call police headquarters in San Francisco. I don't know the number, but they probably have a central line. My name is schillman, room 36. Thank you. I'll hold on. I'd like to speak with detective inspector carmona, please. Homicide division. Thank you. Hi. How do you feel? More or less alive. Did you put me into bed? We kind of helped each other. Don't you remember? It's, uh, all pretty blank. That happens to me. Inspector carmona, please. This is Harold schillman. We made love. Do you remember that? That must have been somebody else. I remember. Inspector. Yes. You asked me to call. You want to talk about suiciding? Listen, I got it all the time. And I got no reason to think that Caroline charnock suicided herself, except for you saying that she jumped. I didn't say she jumped. I said I saw her fall. Well, maybe you got a reason for saying that... Maybe you're involved. If you are, Harold, you're in big trouble. So if you've got something else to say, now's a good time. Now is a perfect time. That's all. That's not good enough. You gonna do better than that. You didn't get to be no police sergeant by saying, "that's what it looked like." You had thoughts then. I want you to have thoughts now. You run a check on me? You bet I did . They say you were a pretty good cop... Till you got in over your head and started slacking off. Letting your friends down. And ended out on your own. What else did they say? That ain't enough? You got drunk... And you've been falling around ever since. They say that you're all messed up now. Ever since you tried to blow your brains out. Why'd you do that? Well, you had to be there. Are they right about you, Harold? They're always right. Maybe you ought to try and change things. Why don't you start right now and stop horsing me about that suicide story. That's what it looked like. I don't want you saying that anymore, because it's making me think that maybe somebody's paying you to be that kind of witness, and that could mean real trouble, serious trouble. I was paid to find her, that's all. Easy money, huh? Maybe you got suicide on the brain, Harold. Maybe that's it. Would you like me to change my story, inspector? I want you to start thinking like a cop again. Want you to use your head. One shoe on the edge of the terrace-- think what does that shoe say to you? Not one little thing. If she got dragged and pushed, one shoe comes off easy. And what do you do with that shoe afterwards when you see it? You leave it right there. Isn't that what you would do? Because it would look pretty funny if that shoe came after her 10 seconds later. Now what do you say? I don't know. Then I'm going to tell you. Two shoes and a depressed lady makes it suicide. One shoe and a not-depressed lady makes it murder. That's how it's going into the books, Harold-- murder one-- until somebody proves to me different. You got proof? Only what I saw. Not good enough. I'll tell you something else. I don't think I like you anymore, Harold. You're no accident, not like some tourist walking down the street. You're in there, you're in there right up to your buns. And I might even have to get you, Harold. Carmona was pushing me, and I was resisting, just the way I resisted in the hospital. It wasn't that I was withholding information, but that I didn't have any. That's what was troubling carmona. Now it was troubling me. "Think like a cop," he said. I haven't done that for a long time. I'm not sure I can. Still interested in buying it? Price ought to be about right. I'll take that answer now. What time did Mrs. Charnock get in? Yesterday it was worth 20 bucks. Yesterday I was generous. Today I'm in a hurry. That's your problem. I got all day. You got 10 seconds. I'm not going to ask again. Tough. Ah! Ah! You're crazy! Last chance. Morning. 10:00. Yesterday? Yeah. Now let me go. When was the last time you saw her before that? About a month ago. Was she alone? Yeah. Now let me go! You're breaking my neck! He'll be right with you. Where the hell have you been? Why? Haven't you heard? They're saying now that Caroline was murdered. Lousy reporters here all afternoon. How's charnock? Not good. He's keeping it all bottled up inside. It could tear him apart, schill. Wide apart. Better let him know you're here. Honey, could you get me charnock, please? Got couple of messages for you. Uh, char, I hate to disturb you, but I thought you should know that schillman just got here. Okay. He wants to see you. Now. I'll take you over there. Where? The schvitz. Tell you gotta little something going with fay, huh? You think of everything. I do my best. Take your choice. You're an unpleasant jerk. Anybody ever tell you that? All the time. Yesterday when you said that Caroline had jumped, I couldn't believe it. Not Caroline. I know about suicide. You asked me once if I thought Caroline was connected with the problems here. I said I didn't know. But in my heart, I suppose I did know. I just didn't want it to be true. So her death, Mr. Schillman... Her death is still involved. I want the answers. Where did she go when she left here? Why did she run away? I want to know who killed her. Rest for a while. He wanted to know who killed her. Suddenly, I was no longer just working for Carl charnock. Now I wanted to know who killed Caroline. And I didn't even know who the hell she really was. Her name was Caroline Selby when we met. That was about 2 1/2 years ago. And after that? Caroline told me certain things-- that she had no family, that she lived in New York before moving to L.A., that she'd been a photographer's model. But I never pressed her. I didn't want to know the personal details. Married before? No, but she was an experienced woman. However... The life we began together was a new life. What came before that didn't matter. It does now. Yes, now it does. I won't need to know everything, Mr. Schillman, only those things-- I understand. What about just before she left? Was there anything different, anything unusual? No. She knew what was going on. Mr. Schillman, everybody knew. When was the last time she had her car serviced? Just before she left. Why? Well, the mileage should be on the invoice. I could check that against the mileage on it now, find out how far she went. Yes, I see. $10,000, as we agreed. The check is certified. You were hired to find her, and you found her. What you do now calls for a new arrangement. I think this covers it all. It doesn't, but an additional 15,000 will. I've always found it better to pay my debts. Owing is far more costly. I called fay from up in Tahoe and said I'd drive down in the morning. She said, "come on down tonight." What the hell. I had no place else to go. [Loud music playing] Hi. Come on in. I'm Gloria. Fay's...Little sister. You are schill, aren't you? Yeah. I'm schill. Then come on in. Hey, schill. Nice to see you. Hi. Listen, faithy went to the can. She'll be out in a minute. I'll fix you a drink? No, thanks. You just drive down? You made pretty good time. How are things up at the lake? Quiet. Come on. Have a little drink. We're just sitting around, talking about old times. Faithy went out and bought a bottle of Brandy just for you. Well, in that case... So what's going on in Tahoe? I didn't see much of anything. Hi. I missed you. I bet. Faithy was really worried about you. [Fay] Gloria. Well, you were, honey. That's all you talked about all day. You've got a big mouth. Look...can we get out of here? Sure. What is it? Honey...tell me. Nothing. You've got too much on your mind, that's what it is. Yeah, probably. And you're tired. You're thinking about her? About who? Caroline. I am now. It's really hard to believe that she's dead. You know, you said she killed herself, but on the news, they say it was murder. Maybe it was. But you're the one who saw it happen. Yes, I seem to be the one. How well did you know her? Mmm...just... You know, not really. She never was very friendly, even when I first knew her in L.A. What was she doing then? I don't know. She was just around. We used to know lots of people then. You and who? Joe. I was 17 when we got married. Just a dumb kid. Can you imagine? 17? Did Joe know her, too? I don't know. Probably. It was a long time ago. I never saw her again until after she married Mr. Charnock up in Tahoe. All those strings. What strings? Tying everybody together. I don't get it. Even you. You're still working for him? Yeah. Yeah, I'm still working for him. Why don't you turn out the light? Little fay's just bushed. Little fay and Caroline in L.A.-- another coincidence. The answer had to be with Caroline. Carmona's probably right. Two shoes--suicide. One shoe--murder. Wow. Some people really know how to live. Oh, I didn't mean it like that. [Schillman] Mean what? Well, Caroline being dead and... It just sounded bad. Oh, forget about it. What are you doing, honey? Just looking. Did you find something? Let's go find out. Go on. Take a look around. You sure nobody's here? [Loudly] Anybody here? See? It's spooky here. That's where she went off. I don't want to see it. Now what are you doing? Caroline's car had, um... 7,461 miles on it when she left Tahoe. It now has 8,544 miles, which means she drove... 1,183 miles. Correct? If you say so. Divide that in half, you come up with 591.5. What's about 500 miles from San Francisco? L.A.? Where Caroline used to live. It's about 500 miles to Las Vegas, too. Why would she go to Las Vegas? Why would she go to L.A.? I don't know. You want to be a secretary? Sure. Call this number-- canyon rolls Royce in Beverly Hills. Ask for the service manager. Tell him you're calling for Mr. Schillman of hartman insurance. Ask him if he recalls servicing Mrs. Caroline charnock's white rolls Royce convertible with Nevada license plates within the last two weeks. What's hartman insurance? If he says yes, call me. Where are you going? I'm just going to look around. Mr. Schillman? Mr. Howard is on the line. I'll take it in here. Mr. Howard. Harold schillman. I'm glad we finally located you. Yes. Mrs. Caroline charnock's rolls Royce-- do you happen to have the invoice handy? I'll hold on. Every little girl's dream. Right out of a magazine. Not your style, huh? Do I look the type? Neither did Caroline. Yes, Mr. Howard. I'm right here. Was it the air conditioner pump that you replaced? The car only had 8,000 miles on it. Yes. I see. I understand. I just wanted to be sure. Oh, one more thing Mr. Howard-- what address did Mrs. Charnock give you in Los Angeles? What hotel? Uh-huh. Okay. Thank you. No. No problems. You've been very helpful. Thank you, Mr. Howard. Now I suppose you think you're terrific. Well, you must admit I'm getting better. Oh! Uhh! Ha ha! The door was open. I closed it, inspector. Well, it wasn't locked, Harold. Wait for me in the other room, will you, honey? Who is that? What is it, Harold-- you want to make it in a dead woman's bed? What is that? Some special kinda kick? We all have our little idiosyncrasies, inspector. Yesterday you come here and you kick the beans out of the garage attendant. Today you mess around with the lady's car. Then you and your friend come up here. Just what are you up to? I came up here to make a phone call. Is that why Mr. Charnock gave you the keys-- so you could use the phone? It's not against the law. That's very funny. Harold, you should tell me what you're doing. Because it won't be so very good if I have to guess. I'm working for Mr. Charnock, inspector. Still or again? Just doing a few odds and ends. Are you lying to me, Harold? Ask him. I'm asking you! Withholding evidence from the police is worth five years, Harold, remember? That's not like some crummy section 502 drunk charge that they don't even process because they all feel sorry for you. Now, we've still got a murder to solve, Harold. Remember? You ever think of going back to Havana, inspector? Tsk. All the time, Harold, all the time. Wow! The way he walked in like that. I didn't know who the hell he was, and there we were on the bed. Didn't you think that was funny? Yeah, it was funny. Except you're not laughing. Now what do we do? First I drive you back to Gloria's. I'm flying down to L.A. For how long? I'll be back tomorrow. Well, then, let me come with you. That way I can be sure you come back. When I hold on, I hold on tight. My car was in the parking lot at l.A.X. The battery was dead. It took an hour for the tow truck to arrive and another hour to fight traffic to the adriatic hotel. It didn't matter anymore why charnock had hired me. Now I wanted to do the job. It was more than just having something to do. It was making me feel alive again. You won't forget about me, will you? The manager around? Police? My name's schillman. I'm Mr. Krueger. You're the manager? Assistant manager in charge of security. Just the man I want to see. Regarding? A few questions about Mrs. Caroline charnock-- she left here a few days ago. Yes. I'm familiar with the situation. The hotel would of course appreciate as much discretion as possible. There's been no publicity so far. Why start now? You wouldn't mind if I looked around her room? Would you? I'm afraid that suite is occupied. What about a copy of her bill? Phone calls, messages, visitors, anything else you've got. I'll get the file. It's all there. I hope so. Hate to make two trips. What about the phone calls? There's a list. There's no way of tracing the local numbers she dialed herself. Just the toll calls and the one long-distance. Those were all made on the day she arrived. Long-distance to where? Nevada. I believe you'll find that to the number of castle lodge. Visitors? No. However, she did receive a letter which was forwarded to the San Francisco address. I knew you'd tell me something. Hello, Marilyn. It's me--schillman. Yes, I know I was fired. Well, tell him I quit, but, uh, do me a favor anyway, will you, just for the fun of it? 555-5185-- run a tracer on it, and I'll call you back. Oh, come on. Sure you can do it... If you really want to. Okay. Uh, that was Sebastian. Just passing through in the parking lot? You were in there long, and I had to talk to him. You seem to have ex-husbands everywhere we go. Sebastian. He doesn't give a damn about the kid. All he cares about is himself. He knows I need the money. Or I'd never ask. You told me he's always broke. Not that broke. He just bought himself a new car. That's what made me so angry. He said if I really needed money, I could make it easier than he could. How much do you need? You don't like it when I talk about that, do you? I'll give you some money. If you don't want me to, I won't do it anymore. What do you want? What do you think? Then don't worry about the money. I won't. [Thunder] This is how you live? It's where I live. Make yourself at home. Marilyn, this is schillman again. Did you get it? You say it's a pay phone in the valley? Well, that's a dead end. Ew! Thanks, anyway. [Hangs up telephone] Good lord. There. You feel better? Listen, I'm one swell housewife, so don't mess around. How can you drink it like that? You get used to it. Getting used to something doesn't make it good. It's terrible. You know, when I was a kid, I used to love beer. Joe used to say I was a cheap date, and I really looked young then. So when we went out, I could never get served. For somebody who doesn't like it, you do pretty good. The story of my life. Pour. You want to fly back to San Francisco with a hangover? That's tomorrow morning, and who cares about tomorrow morning? Listen, Mr. Schillman, I'm going to tell you something. You go right ahead. I changed my mind. Good. So do I. You're easy to get along with. That's what they tell me. Well, I'm easy to get along with, too. Don't you think so? Good old easy-to- get-along-with fay. And good old easy-to- get-along-with schill, except...you get mean sometimes. I never do. Except I hate your ex-wife. So do I. And you hate Sebastian and Joe. I do? You ought to, especially Joe. I was 17 when we got married. When I was 18, he turned me out. You know what I mean? The first time for money. Good old easy fay. Good old dumb fay. Huh. Just a cute little kewpie doll who believed anything. I really thought I was living the life, going to parties, meeting all sorts of people, like miss Caroline Selby. Huh. But I was just another loser, just another dumb broad, living easy and thinking just because Joe bought me a Mercedes convertible that the party and the people were going to-- were never going to end. I'll tell you something about that car. After I left Joe and moved in with Sebastian, Joe came over one night and poured sugar in the gas tank. How about that? The one really nice thing I had, and he had to ruin it. [Sigh] As if Sebastian was any better. That earthquake is the best thing that ever happened to me. Got me the hell out of here, and for a while, I thought it was going to change everything, and maybe it would have. Then I ran into-- then I met somebody in Tahoe. Do you hate me? I couldn't live if you hated me. I swear I'll never do it again. Never. Don't hate me. The letter was waiting there in Caroline's polished brass mailbox forwarded from the hotel in L.A. No one had bothered to look. Dead people don't get mail. You must really like it here. It's the only place I know. You were so bombed, I'm surprised you remember. Late night. I felt it all coming together now-- all the pieces sliding into place... Or almost all. I wondered what fay's story would be this time. You lied to me, didn't you? About what? About, uh, making love. Yes. Why? Because I guess I wanted it to be true. It doesn't matter, schill. I've had enough sex to last me the rest of my life. I don't care about it. Okay. That's the only lie. Okay. Forget it. Look what I found today. What is it? Look. Oh, my god. Recognize anybody? Caroline. So she made a stag film. You didn't know about it? No. I swear I didn't. I wish I did. She used to act like the fanciest $500 trick in town, and the rest of US, well, we weren't in her class. So she was hooking, huh? You bet she was. Joe was setting up dates for her until I found out. Oh, ho. I blew my cork over that one. Joe backed off. Caroline just disappeared. I didn't see her again until Tahoe after she married Carl charnock. You'd think she'd be a little nervous running into me. Not Caroline. All she said was, "how nice to see you again." Did you tell Joe about that? Yeah, but that was a couple months later. He wasn't very interested. Maybe he already knew. It was right after Caroline disappeared in L.A. That Joe went to jail, isn't it? How did you know about that? I ran a check on him. He did two years in chino. And it was all his own fault, too. Getting involved with those crooks-- I told him he was crazy. But he said it was going to be easy money. Those guys stole everything in sight. And Joe got caught. So, what did you do while he was away? That's when I met Sebastian Reid. Then after Joe got out, it was all over between US. What are you doing, schill? My job. Mr. Charnock is expecting me up there tomorrow, and he wants me to tell him who killed Caroline. Do you know? Who? You think it was Joe, and that's why you're asking me. Where is he, fay? You know what you're asking me to do? You don't have to tell me. But if I don't? Okay. Going somewhere, Joe? What are you doing here? I work for Mr. Charnock. Didn't fay tell you? I don't know. I don't remember. She just called you, didn't she? What are you talking about? Nobody called me. Joe, look, I used to be a cop. 18 years in San Diego. I got into some rough action down there, but I never lost. I haven't met the punk who could take me yet. Oh. Congratulations. Joe, I can beat you. I can hurt you. Hey, I'm a lover, not a fighter. You're a pimp. You turned fay into a whore. Okay, I'm sorry. What do you want me to do? I want the rest of the film. What film? You're making me very angry, Joe. I'm going to take it all out on you. Now give me the film. Look, what the hell. It's in the trunk. How much did you get, Joe? How much do you want? Look, i--i was just trying to scare her. You did a hell of a job. Aah! What do you think you're doing? Shut up! [Sirens and radios] Seems like you make trouble everywhere you go, Harold. Don't talk like that, inspector. I'm doing a good job. What did you burn? A roll of film. A hotel employee tried to stop him and an another witness says the guy that got killed tried to run away from him. You make it really tough, Harold. I can explain everything. I bet you can. Well? Go ahead. Once upon a time... Book him! Wait a minute. Bring him back here. You make me lose my temper, Harold. I'm sorry. Last chance, so do it right. The dead man is Joe hervey, a pimp from L.A. He's got a record. Years ago, he had a high-class hooker named Caroline Selby. She quit the business and showed up in Tahoe, respectable as hell. Six months later, she married Carl charnock. He knew absolutely nothing about her past. You making this up, or is this real, Harold? After the wedding, she ran into somebody who knew her from the old days. She couldn't wait to tell Joe the news. Joe saw the gold and went for it. Caroline was afraid to tell her husband, so she paid Joe to keep his mouth shut. She kept on paying until finally it got too hot and she panicked. Slow down. Slow down. Caroline drove down to L.A. To tell Joe hervey the good times were all over, but Joe didn't let go so easily. When she came back here, he followed her and put pressure. That's when I showed up. Caroline told me the easiest lie that came to her mind with, probably, good old Joe hiding in the bedroom. After I left, Joe tried to frighten her by dragging her to the terrace, except she went over. All of a sudden, you remember all of this. Explain yourself. Well, I figured it out. "Start thinking like a cop." That's what you said. Full of holes, Harold. Full of holes. Joe hervey is a piece of meat. You burned the blackmail evidence. You got no proof, Harold. A cop needs proof. So I'm a little rusty. Harold, what am I going to do with you? Inspector, you wanted me to book him? I rehearsed my speech all the way up to Tahoe, trying to make it sound better than it was. There was no way to make it sweet. You're not going to like what I have to say. I don't expect to. Your wife was a hooker in L.A. Hey, schill, you don't-- she made a stag film. Joe hervey had it and he was blackmailing her. I burnt the film, all except this. There. No more film. No more Joe hervey. That's it, huh? I got more. Do you want to hear it? Let it alone, char. Don't torture yourself. I'll handle the rest. Not this time, smiley. Why don't you lay off, pal. Enough is enough. Take your money and go home. Buy yourself a bathtub full of booze. It's up to you. I'm listening. When your wife drove down to L.A., one of the first things she did was call back up here. That's number one. Number two--Joe hervey was hitting her hard for a lot of money. She had to get it somewhere. Three--fay Reid is Joe hervey's ex-wife. She knew Caroline in the old days, but when she mentioned seeing Caroline up here, Joe already knew it. Alright. That's one, two, three. Go ahead. Add them up. I'm trying. If fay wasn't the only one who knew Caroline, then it figures whoever she called must have been Joe hervey's pal, someone who could help her get the money-- pay him off a lot of money. Now, where would you get a lot of money around here? The casino cashier. Tough place to get into, but not for you. I have the keys. I suppose Caroline could borrow them long enough to make copies. I suppose so. Come on. If Caroline went anywhere near that cashier, everybody up here would have heard about it. But what if Caroline gave the keys to her old friend to help her get the money, and the old friend decided to keep the keys and help himself, knowing that Caroline couldn't do anything about it? Ah, that's a mighty big what-if. I've got another one. What if Caroline thought the only way to stop her old friend was to tip off the gaming commission that the casino was being skimmed? Who is it? I'm just guessing. Maybe smiley can help US. Why me? Well, you never did like Caroline. You made it very easy for me to find out about her past. All you had to do was introduce me to fay. You know something, schill? You took all the wrong steps, but you got there. I didn't know anything about Caroline's past. I mean, sure, we didn't get along together, but I wasn't looking for anything like that. It was something else. See, uh... I figured out that she was f-fooling around up here right under your nose. I didn't know how to tell you. How do you tell somebody something like that? I figured that, uh, you'd, uh, you'd get mad at me or that you wouldn't believe me, and, uh... I would have to leave. I got nowhere else to go, so I didn't say it. I couldn't say the words, char. I didn't do anything. And then when it got worse, uh, there was nothing else I could do. Hey. Howdy. You scum. What did I do now? I checked with the girl on the phones. She remembered. You got a long-distance call the day after the casino shut down. So what? It was my wife who called you. Why would she call me? Let me get a couple of boys to soften him. Forget it. You waited too long, Rudy. You had a chance to run. You should have taken it. You got nothing. You were sleeping with my wife. You were blackmailing her. You can't prove it. Oh, yes, we can. You're so dumb, I bet you've still got the keys. What keys? Why don't we take a look through his room? Put the gun down, Rudy. How far do you think you could get? Far enough. You're not going anywhere. No! There wasn't anything I could do, not for the living and certainly not for the dead. Joe hervey and smiley, both of them had a run at death, but not Caroline. There was so little cause for her to die. There's a job here for you if you want it. No. It just wouldn't feel right. I understand, but if ever you do want it... $15,000. What are you going to do? Go home. I'll have someone drive you to the airport. No. I'll just call a cab. Smiley...jumped in front of me, didn't he? Yeah. Maybe that was his atonement. Atonement? For not telling you, for not saying anything. Maybe it was an accident. Smiley was with me for 30 years. That's a long time. You could give me a lift. If you want to say no, then just say it. It won't kill me. You called him, didn't you, fay? You called Joe up and told him I was coming so he wouldn't be there. Yeah. I had to. I knew him so long. I couldn't just... No, I guess you couldn't. I'm, uh, leaving this place, moving back to vallejo, raise my kid. I'm trying real hard to make you like me. I like you, fay. Yeah. Well, maybe if one of these days... Maybe you'll call. You have the number. [Horn honks] I had a feeling it might be you. I heard there was a lot of excitement up here before-- shooting and everything. And you tried to tell me you weren't a cop. Baloney, pal. I know a cop when I see one.
