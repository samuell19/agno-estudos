You know you're not welcome here. How much? It's less than expected. We've been doing these little scams for years. We need to aim higher. Why are you dressed like that anyway? We need more. Is it ever gonna be enough? Something's missing. Yeah, maybe a proper plan dude. Shoot. You guys... You guys go! I'll distract the cops. Go, go, go! I consider myself a very intelligent person but at times I make mistakes, I'm honest. It's true, I'm a liar. Let's say that often I'm confused. I don't know what I do or why I do it. Does that make sense? No. None of this makes sense. Your honor, we have seen this defendant in the courtroom way too many times! This time the state wants him behind bars. Mr. Gibson, have you learned anything from what happened? Yeah that running away isn't always the best option. You decided to defend yourself without an attorney. I don't need attorneys. I don't need anyone! I have the impression you're not giving the necessary importance to this hearing, or to this court! This is an offense to the entire judicial system. He is clearly deserving of some kind of punishment. Rehabilitation, not punishment. So you were in foster homes - for years? - Yeah. Since my dad killed my mom. It was a car accident but I don't remember much about it. But you still have a grandmother? She had a breakdown after what happened and I never saw her after that. She lives in Kentucky but I don't think she remembers who I am. It's been many years and she has that thing that makes you lose your memory. So I sentence you to house arrest at your grandmother's residence for two weeks. You-you can't do that! It's my courtroom! And I'm old enough to do as I please. Two weeks in the middle of nowhere?! Let's make it four weeks. I hope that'll be enough to make a difference. Pastor John, let me help you. What about my bags? I work for your grandmother, not you. Mmhm. She gave you more food for the homeless? No, no, it's for the town fair. Although it's been decades since we had one. We can't give up hope. You always need to stand firm in the faith. Be courageous. Be strong. First Corinthians Chapter sixteen, verse thirteen. - Who are you? - Jesus Christ! Are you really Jesus? No I'm your grandson, Chris. Oh. Chris. Well Chris, you're just in time for tea. Ah Joe. Could you please make some tea? We have company. Yes ma'am, with pleasure. Look honey, what I found. Remind me again, who are you? Chopin! Come here, kitty. Come here pretty kitty, and eat a cookie. Careful, Ms. Melody. This tea is hot. Oh, how lovely. We haven't had a visitor in quite a while. Well, I just love tea time. Beethoven! You haven't eaten a thing today. Come here and eat at least one cookie. Come here. Come here. Come kitty. Come, you haven't eaten a thing all day. I hope you'll feel at home here. I'll be OK. It's already a major upgrade for me, I never had my own room before. Yeah, well, this is not your room. So, kindly refrain from moving or touching any personal items. Dinner will be served at 7. Sharp. Right. What's there to do around here? You're gonna need to help me with the farm and your grandmother. - Hey Joe? - Yep. What's the Wi-Fi password? There ain't no internet here. Excuse me. Can you keep a secret? Yeah, sure, grandma. Come. I show you my treasure. Come on. Come on. It looks like someone has a thing for corn. Corn was domesticated in Mexico over 10 000 years ago. The deeper you go the better the corn. Of course, you have to have the right amount of water too. We have the biggest corn farm in Kentucky. - Really? - I'm the queen of corn. I think... Who cares about all of that anyway? Chris! Chris! Oh my God, I'm glad you're ok. Finally getting some signal out here, but just getting all your messages now. - How's Kim? - Oh, she's good. She's actually right here with me. You guys gotta drive down here as soon as possible. - What's going on? - Yeah, drive where? To the wonderful countryside of Kentucky! Why? I finally found the treasure we've been looking for. Ah. Ms. Melody, you play really well. And that tune is beautiful. It's Mary's favorite. Tomorrow we'll all have breakfast together. I'll make French toast. You'll see how she devours it. Yeah. It's time to go to bed. Okay. Chris! Wake up! There's work to do. Here you go. Right here. There's so much to do around here. Yes. This is only the beginning. Property runs on for hundreds of acres. This whole property belongs to Melody? Yep. I better go change, I smell like a... Animal? Yeah. Let's say I was gonna say that. Hey, just be quick, OK? Sorry guys, I got no signal, but I'm on my way to meet you. I hope you get this. How do you like it today? It's the same everyday. Well some days are better than others. Do you remember when we were young, we used to run around all the time? Things were different then. We were free. We were always smiling. I don't remember you smiling while running away from that dog, What was his name? - That was George's dog, Tobias. - Tobias. And every night your mom was making soup for everyone. She was keeping us all warm. All those good things have been forgotten. Can we help you? No, I'll pass for today, I don't need a makeover. Oh wait actually, can you help me? Can you help me hide? Did you forget about your grandmother? No, I'm not the one with Alzheimer's. I run every day. Well please get in the car. We need to get to the hospital. - But I'm all sweaty. - Would you just get in? Ms. Melody, how do you like your grandson's new look? Pretty. Remember, you're not on vacation. Yeah well there's nothing but weeds here anyway. What happened to all the corn? I grow enough to feed our animals but... these fields used to grow enough corn to feed the whole town. Kept the whole town working too. Your farm is really big. Are you still in charge grandma? Of course not, Mary is. You help your grandmother get inside. I'm gonna park the car. Ms. Melody, good morning. I've been waiting for you, running a little late today. I guess it's my fault. Couldn't find an outfit? It's a long story. And you are...? I'm Chris, her grandson. The butler should be out there parking the car. OK, uh... that is for you. Oh, come on. C'mon, c'mon, don't be like... don't be like that. Easy. Easy does it. Calm down. Calm down. Easy. Shhh. Oh. Hey, hey. Look... look who just came to see you. Hey, you know, I suspect you made all that noise just to get her attention, huh? He always calms down when you come Ms. Melody, you see? - We are all here for you. - That's right. Who was that patient? That was George, he's your grandfather. My grandfather? I didn't even know I had one. There are probably many things you don't know Chris. Does she even remember him? She may not remember his name but you never forget love. Will my grandma be like him? George is very ill. He's no longer independent, that's why we're keeping him here under observation. On the contrary, Ms. Melody's disease is progressing but at a much slower rate. We feel that the therapies that we're doing are really working. Is there cure for Alzheimer's? No. But with science, each day counts. Oh here he is. I'm sorry doctor, I was parking the car. I'm glad you finally made it. There are certain things I'd rather not deal with. Well... these things concern your grandmother. Look at her. She's such a treasure. Hey! Finally! We've been waiting for hours. Welcome to real America. Welcome to the middle of nowhere. Yeah my worst nightmare. I missed you guys. We missed you too. I missed you the most. So, what are we doing here? Yeah please tell me you've got a plan. - What do you see? - Nothing. No, you need to see the potential. Don't you see it? I see a way to get our real island. It turns out my beloved Grandma owns one of the largest corn farms in the entire South. Our island... Truth doesn't exist. We create our own versions of reality that are all different from each other. Welcome to Bluegrass Farmers Bank & Trust. And who do I have the pleasure to speak with? I'm Chris, Melody's grandson. And this is Kim, my fianc√©e. In general, the mind chooses what it wants to see, but in a magic trick, it comes down to what I choose to show you. Well, I think what you're doing for your grandmother is admirable. 'Cause it's all just a confidence game. It's all just a matter of turning your attention to something else while I distract you from the trick. Well, howdy, folks! How are you doing? Where is the manager of this fine establishment? Let me go take care of the... that situation. Well, now, see... I hear you talking to me, and yet I still don't have my problem fixed. Alright? What does it take to get some help around here? Well, congratulations. You've just been added to Grandma's account. Oh. Ah, oh boy. Sorry for the interruption. Can you please just verify that I've been added to the account? My lawyer in New York should have already taken care of this. You are on the account. But I still need Joe's signature or Melody's password to give you access. My grandson liked magic. He did tricks. Well, magic isn't real, so... Why do you say that, honey? Cause happy endings don't always happen. Well, if it ain't happy, it ain't the end. Hey grandma, what are your favorite numbers? Oh, definitely four. Do you have a password or a series of numbers you remember? I really like eight. But I really don't know if it's really one of my favorites. Grandma, it's fine. It's fine. All good. Let's forget about this. Hey, where have you been all day? You know I could have you arrested. Hey Joe, my grandmother seems to really like you and need you, and we're both very thankful for what you do, But let's just make something clear: You're just an employee. Yeah, and you should remember why you're here. Don't you ever get frustrated when Melody can't remember anything? Look, she doesn't remember certain things but she remembers about her family and the past. You see, Ms. Melody is slowly disappearing. Alzheimer's disease starts by making you lose your short term memories, then you find yourself not being able to dress, brush your teeth, hold a fork, untill you become bedridden. You should pay more attention to your grandmother. You might actually learn something about her. Anyone for popcorn? - My favorite as a kid. - I know silly. You're always in my prayers. - You remember who I am? - Of course I do. You... You are you. - Are you sure? - Well, who else could you be? Jesus! Exactly. And grandma would do anything for him. I think we need a bit more of a traditional look. Here we go, after all he was born in Middle East. Maybe something a little more classical. Oh c'mon, that's like too far back in the days. That's a baby. That's it! That's the one. - That's the one. - That is you. I mean, look at resemblance. Yeah. OK, so, maybe you guys can add a little magic touch, just to make it a little more believable. Maybe a like, a wig or a costume? While we're at it, let's ask the local pastor which verses of the Bible talk specifically about money, wealth, will, generosity... And what are you gonna do? This time, I'll do the most difficult part. I'll get into the part. These are the only wigs I've got for sale. Um... How about that one? You are pretty. You have no reason to hide. Oh, I was just... Well, never mind about that. I loved dressing up in these when I was a kid. - Hello pastor. - Hi. I need to find out which chapters and verses of the bible talk of generosity. You're getting a calling? No. No, this is for Chris. Well you give your friend Chris a message for me, it's important you tell him that I'm here whenever he wants to speak. I wish we could spend the rest of our lives not wearing any makeup. Just be us. How do I look? Great. Oh, just in time. Costume's clean, and ready. Ah I don't know what to say. Me neither but hopefully the Holy Ghost will tell me soon. Proverbs 19:17. "He who gives to the poor also lends to the Lord, and He will reward them for what they have done." I should give everything to the poor. Indeed, Chris is poor, very poor and he runs a charity to help other kids who are poor just like him. You should change your will. I know what you are after. It was mine. Could you take it to Mary? Ms. Melody. - Joe. - I'm home. Yo! Why didn't you take the necklace? It's gotta be worth at least a couple of thousands. It's worth more. It belonged to my mother. Ms. Melody? Where are you? Go, just go. Just go, just go! Wait, Kim. Kim, stay. - I need your help. - Ok, ok. No, no, no. Hey. Hey. It's OK. That's a tough one to remember. Hey, I think it goes like this, right? You're gonna need a lot of help to fix this. No. You gotta help me with the plan. We have to make this work. - What's that? - Hm. A chest? No, this is a treasure chest. Yeah there's even signal up here. It's magic. One of your lovers? It was my father. You know I never got to meet mine. Dads, who needs them. You got that right. So to try get her to remember the password, we should try to make her remember her past and family. We need to get in her mind. - I see you've already met. - Oh yeah, she's already told us all the bad things about you. Do you know Mary? Alright I need to get going. I need to get to the city hospital. No! It's alright, it's nothing to worry about, it's just a routine checkup. I want George. I'm sorry Ms. Melody I just can't take you today. Please. Hey, we can take her. After all, we're family. Alright, I'm gonna leave the car with you. You do me a favor alright, keep an eye on him for me, please. - I'll be back in a little bit. - Ok. Oh honey, look what I found. It's beautiful. Ms. Melody, how nice to see you. Do we have a visit scheduled for today? Grandma just wanted to see George. We're about to have music therapy. I like music. Do you still play piano? I play piano. Yes and so beautifully, we would love it if you played for us. Oh no, no. I'll meet you in the common area. Come on, Grandma, let's go see George. I think these patients need more medicines than they do prayers. Well once you choose hope, anything 's possible. What is that some quote from the bible? No. Actually, it comes from Superman himself: Mr. Christopher Reeve. Let's go outside. Oh, no, no. He can't. But we can. We just spoke to the doctor, she said everything was fine. Well, if the doctor gave her approval, who am I to say no? Can you find the missing one? - Melody - Um... George? Don't worry it's only missing, but... look, it's right here. So what about my tip. Well I-I-I can't find the key. What are you talking about? The key... to the... safe. Oh, look. Oh, Bach, look. Yo, there is no key. Yeah we looked everywhere. So what 's the plan now? I don't know, I'm out of ideas. You know I could just disguise myself as Joe and go back to the bank. No, it's too risky. So I could just find some dirt on Joe. I mean, it can't be that difficult. What are you talking about? Our main obstacle so far has been the power of attorney. Joe has it, and he shouldn't it. It should rightfully belong to Chris. Well what do you plan to do then? You continue with her emotional recall or whatever it is you wanna call it and you leave the house to me. Are you you wanna do that? I got this. - Now I remember everything - Nice Grandma. Hey, what do you remember? How much I love living on a farm. Do you all remember when you were young and hip? We're still young, and hip. This is a nice store. Well this salon belongs to you, Ms. Melody. I do your hair here every week. Maybe we could try a new hairstyle? No, no, let's go see Pastor John. You know from the side you really do look like Jesus. Do ever think about God or what we're doing here. What, are you becoming religious? No, I just... I don't know, sometimes I think about... our purpose. Why don't you just talk to him? What's the matter with you? Not in the house of the lord. I'm sorry I wasn't going to answer it anyway. It's his father. He just doesn't want to talk to him. Pastor John. Pastor John, what are you doing here? Shh. - Oh my God... Is she... - Sh. No, no, no, no. It's OK. The doctor said it was just normal tiredness. The kids probably forgot to give her some water. Here. You know, I told Chris to watch out for her. And he did. And he meant well you know. I think it's time for Ms. Melody to go out and create some new memories... That she won't remember anyway. Yeah but somebody will. And they will cherish them. It is an experience worth more than all the money in the world. Can I have my drink back now? Did we really play with the goats? Yeah, and we still smell like them. Oh... Well I'm happy. That's good grandma. Don't scare us like that. What else makes you happy? Oh, barn dances and bobbing for apples. We had so much fun. Mama and Daddy would waltz all around the floor. I had a new dress, midnight blue. Daddy spoiled me rotten, mama said. At night you could hear the corn grow. You remind me of someone, I just can't think who. We had a beautiful boy. I loved playing piano for him. Sweet, honest as the day is long. Told me when he stole a cookie. Oh, he was so good. I wonder what happened to him. I'm so happy that you decided to bring Ms. Melody to our music therapy class today. She likes to make people happy. It shows. You're doing great. He's playing along with Ms. Melody. Look, Ms. Melody, he wants to play. Hello. FBI. No, no, there's no need to panic. My name is special agent Fox, Nick Fox. I'd like to ask you a couple of questions. Well what about? Mr. Agent Fox. What do you know about a man named Joe? Joe? Well, he takes good care of Ms. Melody. Well, yes. That's actually why I'm here. The FBI is conducting a special investigation to determine if he qualifies for a social commitment award. That's a great idea! But it's a federal secret, OK? Well, that's about right, since he's the original "secret man". How so? Well, he just dropped out of the sky one day. He just appeared, like... like Mary Poppins. But everybody in town likes him. And... I think he deserves an award. Thank you. How can you live surrounded by so much pain? It's not just pain. Awww. In John chapter twenty-one, verse sixteen: Jesus told Peter to "Feed my sheep". Or rabbit! Where's Jerry? Still looking for dirt on Joe. Hey how you doing man? That'll do it. - Whoa! - I'm so sorry. - You alright? - Oh yeah. Yeah I'm alright, you alright? - Yeah I'm great. - You sure? Grandma, what are you doing up? I can't sleep. Mary is not home yet. Here... take these, whenever you're scared, - try to remember... - What? that you're not alone. Where are we? This was the original farm homestead. Your grandfather built it, it's been in the family for generations. That's George, your husband. Do you remember? Of course I do. He's a hottie. My Mary. This is where she got married. Right here at the cabin. Something happened. They put me in the hospital, and a little boy got lost. What happened to the boy? - Oh Joe. - It's alright. - Joe... - It's alright, Ms. Melody. Who is that lady? Who is she? Ma'am, calm down. Why is she staring at me? Why does she have that sad face? Oh, c'mon. It's time to go. No. No! And who are you? What are you trying to do to me? Tell me. Tell me! It's alright. What are you doing? Tell me. Tell me! No! No. C'mon. Shhh. It's OK. It's OK. Hi, yeah... Melody's house. No, Joe is not here... OK, I... I understand. Don't you all cry for me when I go. Nothing lasts forever. Leaving is part of life. You'll leave too when you're done serving your sentence. You know, it's hardest for those left behind. But George is in a much better place. I see this every day, but you never, you never get used to it. I wanna... pray. Play. Yes, let 's play, let's play Ms. Melody, c'mon. We are gonna play, We are gonna play. We are gathered here today to remember George, and to celebrate his life. Ashes to ashes. We return to where we began: Innocent and free. George will always live in our memories. "For everything there's a reason, and a time for every matter under heaven: A time to be born, and a time to die; a time to plant, and a time to pluck up what is planted." Ecclesiastes three: one-two. Hey Joe. My condolences. Now, I'm confident you'll give the power of attorney to Chris first thing in the morning. Otherwise everyone 's gonna know your little secret. We need to talk. Play tricks. We're all here. We're not all here. We can't change the past. - I am my past. - That's your choice. That's my choice, really? This is a choice? You don't know anything about what I've been through. You don't know anything about me. Are you sure about that? Did you really think you could fool anyone, me or the bank manager? We've all been here for you. We're trying to help you. You had the courage to complain about your father so much. My father? I hate my father. He killed my mom and to me, he's dead, too. Have the courage to call him and tell him how you feel, before it's too late. After I got out of prison, I read in the newspaper that your grandma was looking for some help. See, for all those years, behind bars, all I could think about was your mother. The accident. All the pain that I had caused. Prison wasn't enough... Getting sober wasn't enough. I had to make it up somehow. So I changed my identity, you know? I changed my whole life. And I decided I would take care of my mother-in-law, your grandmother. This whole time, you've talked about honesty and respect, but look who's talking. To me, you were nothing then, and you're nothing now. Oh God. Joe... Joe! Joe... Joe, Joe. Joe! Help, help! Are you alright son? Am I your son, too? So, you found out. Everybody knew... but me? I'm the one who married your mom and your dad. You're kidding. Well, I do have a certain age, you know. And I even could've married Melody and George. He was a great man, you know? I'm so lost. You need to have faith, son. There cannot be light without darkness. Don't forget. - What's faith? - Faith? Faith is a choice you make. You need to have faith that all of this is worth it. In order for that to happen, you need to have faith in yourself. - Chris. - Kim? - Your father he... - I already know. That's not what I meant. We took him to hospital. He lied this whole time. He spent so many years of his life trying to make it up to his mother-in-law, - because of... - You can say it: Because he killed my mom. You know it was an accident. He put the most important thing first. He put family first. I just don't think he forgave himself. Joe's heart is beginning to fail. What's wrong with it? He didn't tell you? He's needed surgery for a long time, and now he's getting beyond the time limit for that. Why didn't he do it? He refused treatment. As long as we can get him transferred to a specialized center, where a new heart is available, there is still hope. We'll get him through this. Where's Joe? Don't worry, he's being monitored. Let's just go to bed. - Chris. - Yeah? Do you remember that time, you gave me pneumonia? Yeah. Because you made us stand all night in the rain. It seemed like a good idea at the time. I don't know why I listen to you. I don't know either. We've had some good times. Yeah. Yeah, we have. Most ridiculous outfit? Remember that time, - Sexy cop! - I knew it! - Bachelorette party. - Yeah. I stole their hearts. So ridiculous. We're kings of the island. Yeah... Yeah we are. Now and forever. Yeah. And we're family, Chris... Right? Yeah. When are we going home? Grandma, what are you doing up? This is for scared. Joe'll be fine, you won't be alone. No, no, you. Who will look after you when we're gone? Grandma... I've never asked you this but... How's Mary? Mary... Mary's fine. Did you see her? Oh! Look what I found, honey. Ah. It looks like you made it. Are you ready? Ah Mr. Gibson, I need you to insert your key. Mr. Gibson? I gotta go. I know. Are you ever coming back? The big day has arrived. They're gonna transfer you to the city hospital for your surgery. How's Ms. Melody? She's doing just fine. Chris is taking really good care of her. It's you we need to take care of now mister. Everything's ready. It's time to go. It's a forget me not. It's a beautiful necklace. It's very special. My husband gave it to me, I think. And you gave it to Mary. It was Mom's. Was? Yes grandma. Mom is dead. Really? - Yes. - I see her. I see her in you. She lives in you. This is yours. This is yours. Please, don't ever forget. Oh, hey. The house looks nice and fresh, brand new. We're headed to the city hospital right now. You tell Joe, when he wakes up, that next Sunday I'm gonna be preaching the prodigal son. Bring him back home safely. - Thank you, Pastor John. - You be careful. C'mon. Mr. Gibson, where are you? You were supposed to be in cout this morning. Aren't you back in New York City yet? I'm sorry. I have something more important to take care of right now. Mr. Gibson, I have only one question for you: what makes all the difference? It's a familiar feeling. It's something that I forgot but not really something I couldn't remember that I had but I know I don't really make any sense but you know what I mean? Yes, I know exactly what you mean. And I wish you luck. - Ah! Free! - Oh. I'm free! Oh my... Grandma! Will you find out what floor he's on? Joe? - Oh. Where are you going? - We need to see Mr. Gibson. - He's in Intensive Care. - Visiting hours are over. Come back tomorrow. - Grandma, are you OK? - Melody? Look, my grandma is fainting! - My grandma is fainting! - Code blue, main entrance. I repeat: Code blue, main entrance. - Grandma, are you okay? - Oh... Stop, please. I feel much better. It's OK. I got this. Thank you very much! Hi. We're looking for Mr. Gibson. He's... He's my father. Room 215, at the end of that hallway. Joe. You're a good man. Don't you forget. Chris... Dad. I'm sorry. I just didn't know how to... Believe me, I never forgot you. Surgery is gonna go well. We're all here for you. Just make sure you recover quick, 'cause we gotta go. Go? Where? Home. In the end, Melody was right: It was enough nurturing, giving water, and taking care of what's important... with love, day after day. Grandma's farm started to run again, and I decided to use it to give life to a project I'm very fond of. The moments we share bring us close, give us meaning and purpose, make us happy... and become memories for most of us, unforgettable. Without realizing it, Melody turned my entire world upside down. She taught me love... and the magic of life. She brought people together. And she changed all of us. Forever. She'll always be part of us. She'll always be... remembered. Thanks to her, I found the real treasure everyone was talking about. It's important we do our best... Not to forget.
