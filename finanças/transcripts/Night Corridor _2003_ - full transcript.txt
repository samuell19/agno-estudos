Mr. Sam Yuen, who will receive our Best Foreign Artist of the Year award. Mr. Yuen, thank you so much for being with us. We are very happy to have you here. Originally I have planned a speech for you today, but I've just found out that my brother had an accident yesterday in Hong Kong. For the past few years, I have been struggling... to be an artist here. My brother is the only one who has supported me. So I would like to dedicate this award and my photos to my brother. Thank you. I'm sure you're there. But it really doesn't matter. I just want to tell you... your brother was in an accident... and is in a coma. Come back to Hong Kong or not. You decide. Well, this is of no use now. You never answer any of my letters. Vincent, I knew I'll never see you in London, and now I'm going back to Hong Kong. Ah Hung, when you sent me money last month, you told me you were really scared... when you woke up from your nightmare and found our mother... Who are you? This is my mother's house. Who are you? You must be Sam. You didn't say you're coming back! I come to see my brother. Your brother is dead. I am SlNGH, your stepfather. Where is my mother? She's gone to the funeral You want to use the toilet? No. When will she be back? No idea. How long have you lived here? It's none of your business. I'm her son. I am her husband. And you, any more questions, go talk to your mother. I don't know. He just suddenly came back. What should I tell him? Don't tell him. It must remain a secret. Then you also must keep the secret What secret? Why are you here? Father Chan is here to help us. Your brother has died. We just came back from the funeral. Don't worry. It's okay. Oh, my goodness. Have I done evil? Has Jesus abandoned me? I must have done evil! No... Sam is so upset... only because his twin brother is dead. You hypocrite. Get out! Calm down. He's here to help us, good boy... I don't want his help. I'm returning to England next week. Back to England? Where's the money coming from? I have no money. I have nothing. Please don't go! What are you saying? You've used up all of father's money. You, who made him kill himself. He never gave me money! I had nothing to do with his death! Stop...I better go. If you need me, call me. Sorry, so sorry, Father Chan. So sorry... You think I was responsible for your father's death? Because of him I am so poor today! You treat me like dirt. Shame on you! I was the most popular nightclub singer. I earned so much. Who do you think your father was? He was just a driver. He didn't want me to work. I gave up so much for him. And you think I made him kill himself? You are so wrong! How popular I used to be? They treated me so well. They gave me money. What have I left now? So shame on you! What do you want? First you messed up my life. Now you're messing up my mother's. I agreed with your mother not to tell you. How could your brother support you... on such a low-paying job? How much did my brother owe you? Money is not the problem. You must finish your studies. Why are you so kind to me! Honestly, your mother and I really want to help you. Since I was a child, you say you want to help me. Now, I'm all messed up. Let's forget the past. You better return to England Tell me did you ever touch my brother? Father, the Cardinal is here to see you. It's urgent. Yes or no! Did you touch him? Here are all your records - stealing, fighting etc. Is that all? Yes, that's all. Where's the money? No, I have none. No money? So tell me. How come you have money to send Sam to England? Do you want your bad secret to come out? Do you know how many years you can end up in prison? Who would believe you? Do you want me to get Sam to go to the police? He's not in Hong Kong. You're lying! Well, since you were my Principal in school I'll give you a few days to think this over. If you don't agree I'll announce your bad secret on my radio program. I cannot live without you Though you only love yourself I'm waiting for you Why don't you care about me? I cannot live without you Though you only love yourself I'm waiting for you Why don't you care about me? I cannot live without you Though you only love yourself I'm waiting for you Why don't you care about me? I'm waiting for you. Where have you been? Sing with me! You better sober up. Sing with me! Come on! Where have you been all night? I've been waiting for you to sing with me. I know you must have been out with women. Which one do you like? Bring her to me. Don't leave me alone ever. I'm afraid to be alone. Look! A monkey! Don't bring the monkey back home... Ah Hung, get rid of the monkey... I am not Ah Hung. I am Sam! Don't mention that bad guy. I am not Ah Hung. I am Sam! Stop mentioning that bad guy! Sam makes Ah Singh leave me. I can't live without him. Sam is useless. Studying art. Useless. And you have to support him! So bad. I cannot live without Singh. Come on. Ah Hung, let's sing. Like old times. Let's sing. Where's your uniform? The neighbors say you are so handsome in your uniform. My friends all say you are so cool in it. Let's sing. Like old times. Let's sing. I'll get the music. You go and put on your uniform. Don't forget the hat. Remember to put it on. You go and put on your uniform. Okay? And I'll get the music now. Come out soon. Now I understand why you only took Ah Hung and left me in the dormitory. Father Chan messed me up. You messed up Ah Hung. And now... he's dead. Does this uniform... make me Ah Hung? Sam Yuen. Your books are way overdue. The fine already is $66. Please return them. How come my face was torn off? Nightmare A costume party? Just a few days ago? Excuse me. These books are overdue. Oh, Sam Yuen. What's taken you so long? You know me? You're Sam Yuen, aren't you? I am, but I think... you have mistaken me for my brother. Your brother? What are you talking about? My brother is Ah Hung. Why don't you check it? You're confusing me. I know you so well. Your library card is written... Sam Yuen Look at your library card. See? How can that be? Let me check your lD card. I have no lD card. I gave it to my brother to keep. Why did you do that? Your brother must have used it. Anyway, the one you met was my brother. So, do you have another proof of identity? Oh, I see. When you go home, ask your brother why he did this. Let me make a photocopy. What's become of your brother? He died. In an accident, a few days ago. Really? I'm so sorry. Is this club open every night? Yes, before the 1 997 handover, we were very busy every day with parties, concerts, etc. But we will have a Christmas party in a few days. Who started this club? A merchant in the 1 9 th century who sold paintings. But actually the boxes of paintings... really contained opium for China. There's the men's room. You go. I've to make the photocopy. Meet you in the library. Okay. Wild monkeys kill country park attendant Oh, is the dead here Ah Hung in the photo? Impossible! How can monkeys kill Ah Hung? How could the newspaper spell his name wrong? So cold here. Very cold! Go inside or you'll catch cold. Are you okay? Yes, just a headache. Sit down. Have a rest. Do it slowly... Have a rest. Can I keep that newspaper? It's old. I'll leave it here for you to read. What's wrong? Oh, you've got a fever. You're so hot. Let me give you some pills. Do you think monkeys can really kill a human? It depends on the type of monkey. A large one, like a gorilla, can do. Here, take this. Look at this. Here's my name. Sam Yuen. Really? My name! Let me see. Then it's you who died, not your brother! How can this be? Think about how this could have happened. Start at the beginning. Do you know exactly when your brother died? Sure. That day. My exhibition opened. In London. Last Thursday. But you told me your brother died in an accident! I don't know who to believe. It's morning! Wake up! I have to go. I'll photocopy the newspaper for you tonight. Well, when I was sleeping, I heard some music. Oh, yes. Maybe it was my radio. Oh, will you come to our Christmas party? No, thanks. Do you know my brother very well? Did you notice if my brother ever brought any friends here? Oh, I remember. There was a beautiful girl... with him every time. I can't recall now. Her name? I'll remember when I see her. You come back tonight and I'll tell you. Okay. Thanks. You look so tired. Better go home and have a rest. Okay. Thanks. Not at all. That day, while making our rounds, we lost sight of your brother. We looked for him everywhere and finally found him on the ground with monkeys all around him. His head was bloody and his arms and legs... were torn off. One monkey even ran off with his ear. It was horrible. Oh, you're back! Come here... Today is Singh's birthday. He's brought all this food. Come on, join us. All's fine now. I've talked with Singh. We are a family. Let's be happy together. Singh, go get Sam a beer. Sit down... Why didn't you tell me... Ah Hung was killed by monkeys? Who said that? Come on, sit down. Are you behind this? Answer me. Don't be foolish! Ah Hung was torn to bits by the monkeys. Father Chan told me not to tell you. It's him! What are you all talking about? Ah Hung was using my name. How long was this going on? Calm down man! Shut Up! Don't be like that! People think I'm the one who died. Don't touch me! Hey! Tell me how my brother died. I'm late for the Cardinal Ah Hung used my name. People think I died. Why are you still here? Leave Hong Kong now! Of course you want me to go. You're afraid I'll tell your secret. Did Vincent contact you? Don't go to see him, I beg you. It's only between us. It's been years and it's over. I'm an old man now. Do you want me to go to prison? I can't control myself. What's that to do with my brother's death? It's him. Vincent killed your brother. Why did he do it? He's possessed by the devil. He controlled you from the beginning. That day, I went to your brother's grave. Vincent was there. He turned towards me. Can you believe what he was doing? Eating a human hand! I tried to flee but he chased me Father Chan. There are reports you have abused boys. If this leaks out, the church is in trouble. I also know you have made videos with boys. I can pretend that I don't know. But this is your problem so you must solve it yourself. Late at night, you are so lonely. You are looking at her... and want to say how much you love her. You are obsessed by her beauty. But it's not easy to be with her. She is just a figure... in the painting. This is the story a listener told me. These are the books your brother borrowed. The previous record has been deleted. What is this radio program? Vincent Sze's program - Strange Nights, Strange Secrets'. Have you heard it before? No. Ah, I contacted the girl for you. Did she know of my brother's death? Yes, I told her you are back... only for a week and want to see her. It sounded like she doesn't want to come here. Let me speak to her. Oh, no. That's not necessary. She finally agrees to come, but tomorrow night at 1 2. Thanks. Whenever. What's her name? I better stay here tonight. I don't want to go home. I can hide here and no one will find me. I'll only be safe here. I don't even know this old man's name, but I trust him. He reminds me of my father. the only one... whom I could confide my deeper secrets to. You don't know my name. It's Mr. Luk. Did you just have a nightmare? Don't worry too much. Let me get you some tea. No thanks. I'm leaving. Don't forget to come tomorrow. The girl will be waiting. What's her name? Miss. Chan Sau Bing. Why is my past coming back to haunt me? Why is Vincent's voice again? Why can I not forget him in my life? Did he really control me from the beginning? Somebody's watching us while we were playing football. Was that Virginia from St. Mary's? I don't know her. Don't expect me to find girls for you. Don't be angry! I'm not. Jealous? Father Chan said no girls can come into the dormitory. Why bring up Father Chan? He nearly kicked me out! Remember? You caused trouble. Not him. Why stand up for him? If not for me, Father Chan would still be after you. If you can't live without him, go back to him! I'm hungry. Let's go get something to eat. Please sign... Okay. You're so handsome! So cool! Autograph! Thank you... See you next time. Bye bye. When someone is upset,... You are so lonely. You are looking at her... and want to say how much you love her. You are obsessed by her beauty. But it's not easy to be with her. She is just a figure... in the painting. This is the story a listener told me. He said every day he would go to the gallery... to look at this painting, wishing she could be alive. He asks how they could be together. He also wants to tell her... why he's so obsessed with her. This is Mr. Luk, the librarian. I remind you to come tonight. Chan Sau Bing will be waiting for you. Chan Sau Bing will be waiting for you. If you don't feel well, have a rest. You must take care of yourself. I'll do the work for you. Stop! I said don't do that! Stop! Don't do that! Sam, is that you? That day before he died, Ah Hung came. It was the first time we slept together. A day later... Don't blame yourself! It was only that day that... he told me he had a twin. How long did you know Ah Hung? A few months. I took my students to the country park. Suddenly, some monkeys rushed out. I was scared. Your brother saw this and used his gun to frighten the monkeys. He held my hand and asked if I was okay. Later he even picked up a cute monkey for me to touch. So you fell in love with him? Do you think of me now as my brother? Yes. Since my brother died, I feel lost. I feel like I'm falling into an abyss. Look at me. Tell yourself that you will be all right. Yes, I'll be all right. I'll be all right. Your brother is dead. Father Chan told me not to tell you. Then it's you who died, not your brother! Did Vincent contact you? It's him. Vincent killed your brother. This is City Radio. If you want a radio schedule, press 1. If you want to speak to someone, press 0. City Radio. I'd like to speak to Vincent Sze. He hasn't come in yet. Call him during his program hour at night. Before Ah Hung died, he appeared often in my dreams. He seemed to want to talk to me. Talk about what? You won't understand. He seemed to want to replace me! There's only one Sam Yuen in the world. No one can replace you. Why did Ah Hung tell you I am already dead? Don't over-react. I can't bear this any longer. Let me stay with you. I'm not ready for this. You said you'd let me help you. Let me solve my own problems. Next week I'll return to England. Don't go! How can I find you? Oh, your brother left this at my place. You keep it. He left this in my bed that night. I must go back to school. I must see you tonight. Tonight is Christmas Eve. I must go to church. What about midnight? I'll wait inside the library. Ah Hung was using my name. How long was this going on? Why did you lie to me? We were only born a few minutes apart. How can you compete with me? We were only born a few minutes apart. How can you compete with me? What can I do if I remain here? In your presence, I'm nobody! What can I do if I remain here? In your presence, I'm nobody! If you are Sam, who am l? What do you want? My brother wants you to fuck him! What are you doing? I'm sick. Go see a doctor! You're too early. There's a party going on. The library's closed. But I'm meeting Sau Bing. What time? Midnight. It's only 9 o'clock. The party will be over by then. Go for a walk. But don't forget... to come back at midnight. Gimme a light? Today's headline says... an American cardinal abused his student twenty years ago, and was sentenced to 20 years jail. A church in Hong Kong also received such complaints today. You may wonder why I mention this. Well, I have a friend who was abused by a priest. My sources tell me his name is Father Chan. Vincent, I ask you. Do you still consider me your most intimate friend? Have you forgotten? Every night Father Chan came to me. You were there. You wanted me to help you stay in school. You don't recall? How come you used my name to blackmail him? You never replied to any of my letters from England. I can't live without you. I really...Iove you. Dammit! I've told you so many times... not to interrupt me while I'm on air! Eat your soup. After tonight can we leave this place? Wait until tomorrow. After you're pregnant, I'll take you home to rest. Okay? Eat the soup. Can you let him live? Did you fall in love with him? Vincent. Sam! Why did you hang up on me? I didn't hang up. What are you doing? Wait! Stop! Why did you kill my brother? Did you really have a brother? Are you crazy? I'm not crazy. You promised to join me in England. You promised to go to the airport. I'd been waiting but you never came. So long ago. How can I remember? You've forgotten? The night my father killed himself, you held me in your arms, comforting me, and you promised to take care of me forever. Now. Do you remember? Sam, people change. No, you can't change. What exactly do you want? I want you to...fuck me. You are crazy! Do you know? I can't love anyone else. Only you. Can you let him live? Did you fall in love with him? Father Chan. What are you looking for? A tape. Wait for Sam to come back. The tape has my name and Sam's on it. Father Chan. Some people say... you are a pedophile. Is that true? Did you ever touch Sam? Why should I do that? I raised him. He's my son! What? I am his mother! He's my son. Your son? Your son Ah Hung is dead. He took over Sam's identity and was killed by the devil. What devil? It's all your fault. You committed adultery and had the twins with another man. You wanted to get rid of your husband. Did you think you could hide these things? Your dead husband plotted revenge with the devil. Luckily, he asked me to take Sam away or he'd die too. Don't threaten me. I'm not threatening you. This tape is the proof... of the covenant between the devil and your dead husband. I must burn it and Sam will be safe. What happened? I killed someone. What are you talking about? Don't leave. I'll hide you. They will find me. No, this is my father's place. You're safe here. Let's go see the painting. My father said... a famous European painted it. Really? It's rumoured the devil commissioned it, but the artist later refused. Why did he agree at first? A covenant with the devil cannot be cancelled. And so? Are you scared or do you want to see it? Okay. Sure. How about your family? I have a mother and an elder brother. Really, an elder brother? What's his name? He's dead. Dead? Did you kill my brother? Who are you? I am Olivia, Mr. Luk's daughter. I've been waiting for you all my life. Vincent is dead. You are a free man now. I helped you. Now, you help me... or my father will kill me. Why choose me? Why? My father said only you can make me pregnant. Don't leave! My father will kill you. Oh! You're back. Father Chan was here yesterday. What're you looking for? Father Chan is dead. Have you seen my passport? It can't be true! How can he be dead? There wasn't anything wrong with him last night! Don't ask. Let's find the passport and get out of here. Where are you going? Where? Your brother is dead! You can't go! I must go! I won't let you go! No! Get away! Don't touch me! What do you want? Don't touch me! Don't shoot! Don't shoot him! Give me my passport! What 're you talking about? If you hurt him, I'll kill you. How do we know where your passport is? Oh! I see. When you go home, ask your brother why he did this. Give me back my passport. Your passport is useless now. You cannot control your life. I only do what has been arranged. It's my life. I can control it! How can you control it? Did you ever hear this story? When an eagle gives birth to two chicks, the stronger kills the weaker. You're stronger than your brother, so we choose you. Shut up! Let me see Sau Bing! How can I release her? She is going to have your baby. It's not my baby. It's yours! Okay. You can have the mother. I will keep the baby. Isn't that perfect? Damn you! Where is she? She's in the painting. You are lying! Why should I lie to you? Then wake her up! Wake her? Who do you think you are? You are just the worker bee. You've completed her mission. Now you'll die! I will die with her. No! Do you remember the whole thing from the beginning to the end? That day. My exhibition opened. In London. Last Thursday. I had a nightmare. Sam, Sam, I'm sure you're there. But it really doesn't matter. I just want to tell you... Your brother has died. What's his name? Did you really have a brother? He's dead. Dead? This was painted by Fuseli in the 18th century. Can you guess who this monkey represents? This one? He is the devil. Who would believe that? Let's go. Are you having a nightmare?
