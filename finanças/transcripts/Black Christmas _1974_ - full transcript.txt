Oh, by the way, how come I was the only one there working tonight? We were there this afternoon, Barb. A likely story. - How's it look? - Yule-ish, very yule-ish. Have you got your Santa Claus suit ready? Yeah. What time the little bastards arrive? - At one o'clock. - Terrific! Hello? Pardon? Who? Barb, it's for you. Long distance. Oh, great. Hang on, I'll take it in the other room. Could you guys shut up in there? I can't hear a damn thing! Hello? Mom, hang on, I can't hear you. Operator, I can't hear… what's coming from the other end. Can you…? Yeah. All right, let's see. Party's over! Come on, all the men out! Come on! Bye-bye! No, operator, I still can't hear anything. Hi, Mommy! I can hear you now. No, we're just having a little party. No, I've had a couple. Oh. come on, I'm not drunk. No, no. Um, I have some stuff to do in the afternoon, and then I was just gonna get the seven twenty train into the city. Goodnight! Bye! Oh, come on. You got to be kidding! Why can't I come, too? Well, who the hell is he? Good night. You're a real gold-plated whore, Mother, - You know that? - See you next week. Okay. Hey, call before you come. I'm gonna have to get my parents used to that. I'll just get a couple of my friends and we'll go, uh, skiing. - Goodnight! Bye! - Yeah, sure. I'll be fine. I'll see you around. Hey, Chris, wait up! I'll give you a ride. Put the Christmas music back on. Anyone want to go skiing for a few days? Yeah, sure, Barb. My mother's taking a place up at Mount Holly's. Anyone else want to come? - Yeah, sounds like fun. - Great. How 'bout you, Clare? Uh, no thanks, Barb. I've made some another plans. I'll get it. Hello? Hello? Hello? Hey, quiet! It's him again! The moaner! He's expanded his act. Could that be one person? No, Clare, that's the Mormon Tabernacle Choir doing their annual obscene phone call. Let me lick it! Let me stick my tongue on it and lick it! You… You pig cunt! Yeah, you pig cunt! You pig cunt! Let me lick it! Lick it! Lick it! Let me lick your pretty piggy cunt! Pretty pig cunt! I'll lick your pretty pig clit. I'm like a tuna farm, baby! Mmm, not bad. Suck on my juicy cock! I'll come over. I'll come over and you can… You can suck it. Suck it! Okay? Listen, you pervert! Why don't you go over to Lambda Chi? They could use a little of this. You piggy cunt, you want my fat cock. Oh, why don't you go find a wall socket and stick your tongue in it, that'll give you a charge. I'll stick my tongue up your pretty pussy! You fucking creep! I'm going to kill you. Well, Super Tongue strikes again. Fastest tongue in the west. That was sick! I really don't think you should provoke somebody like that, Barb. Oh, listen, this guy's minor league. In the city, I get two of those a day. Maybe. But you know that town girl was raped a couple of weeks ago. Darling… you can't rape a Townie! You really are too much, Barb. Oh, come on, this is a sorority house, not a convent! I'll see ya later. I'm gonna go pack. Come on, Clare. She didn't mean anything. No, really Jess, it's okay. I have to finish packing anyway. Hasn't she had enough trouble fitting in here without you getting at her all the time? Come on. I know a professional virgin when I see one! Hey, can I get a hand out here? Speaking of professional virgins… Here we have the Queen of Vaudeville circa 1891. Where have you been? I've been shopping. You know how big the store is and how spectacular it is this time of year. I never saw such a bunch ofjunk! Mrs. Mac, come in the other room! We've got a surprise for you! There you are. Where have you been? Mrs. Mac's been looking all over for you. Oh, little puss! Hello. Go on, now! Got some things to do. Oh, let's see. Claude? Is that you, puss? Kitty? Who is that? Who is it? Claude? Who is that? Who is it? Oh, girls… it's really beautiful. It's gorgeous and the color and everything. No, it's really lovely. I've got about as much use for this as a chastity belt! Aw, come on, Mrs. Mac, put it on. Put it on? Oh, come on, I'm not going to bed! Come on, please. Yeah, put it on! Put it on. Anything for you girls, because it's Christmas. Hey, you bet! Okay, girls, party's over. Let's get this junk cleaned up. Oh? Oh yeah, come on. Everybody takes a little something, it won't take long. Come on girls, just a little cooperation. Let's just get you up, 'cause you're tired. You really are! Good night. Before… booze. There you are. Good night, good night. Merry Christmas! Jess, you girls are just too good to me. Oh, nonsense, Mrs. Mac. Hello? Hello, is Jess there, please? Yeah, wait a second, Peter. Jess, it's for you. It's him. Hello? Hi, how's the party? Oh, it was good. Too bad you couldn't make it. I've been… I've been practicing for four days straight. I am really, really wiped out. Yes, I know. Jess, clear… You won't forget to put out the lights? You've got to find some time. I've gotta talk to you. You sound funny. What's the matter? Nothing's the matter. I just wanna talk to you. Why don't you tell me now? Because I wanna talk to you, face to face. Jess, I haven't been to bed in three nights. I'm just not the mood to be playing games. Look, Peter, we'll talk about it tomorrow, okay? Okay. I'll be in Room 30, all day. All right, I'll see you around two. I didn't mean to sound short with you. I… I guess I'm just exhausted, okay? Yeah, it's okay. I love you. I know. See you tomorrow. Yeah, well, good night. Jesus, I wouldn't wear this to have my liver out! Clare? Clare? ♪ Little baby Bunting' ♪ ♪ Daddy's gone a-huntin" ♪ ♪ Gone to fetch a rabbit skin ♪ ♪ To wrap his baby Agnes in ♪ - Oh, thank you. - That's okay. I'm sorry. I should have been keeping a better watch on them. I think so. Yeah, well, I said I was sorry. Excuse me? I hate to bother you. I can see that you're busy. But I wonder if you could help me. You see, I was supposed to meet my daughter here at one o'clock. It's… it's half past now, and she's still not here. Her name's Clare Harrison. Do you know her? Clare Harrison? Yeah, I think so. I know she lives in a sorority house. It's… it's called, um… Pi, uh, Kappa Sig… Ch, of course! Yeah, well, Kappa's our sister sorority. Uh, some of the girls are over here today, but I haven't seen Clare. Uh, the place isn't far. I'll tell you how to get there. Ho, ho, ho, shit! Santa! Please. Look, she's supposed to be going away with me for the weekend, goddammit. Well, we decided that we would go skiing for a few days. Yeah, and I've been looking forward to this for three weeks. Bitch! Isn't Santa naughty? Ho, ho, ho, fuck. I just don't know, Mr. Harrison. Her clothes are all packed and ready to go. I'll bet you'll find her over at the common room. They're having a party there today for underprivileged children. Yes, I know. I'm very disappointed in this atmosphere, and I intend to do something about it. Who's this? Um, uh, that's, uh, a friend of Clare's, a very nice young man from the town. Uh, Chris Hayden. I didn't send my daughter here to be drinking and… …picking up boys. Oh, Clare is a good girl, Mr. Harrison. I wouldn't want you to get the wrong idea about that. She is a good girl. I'm sure you'll find her at the fraternity house. As a matter of fact, I could show you the way. I-I have to go to a store near there. If you wouldn't mind giving me a lift. I know where it is. But I'll be glad to give you a ride. This is very kind of you, Mr. Harrison. I'll just get my bag. "I didn't send my daughter here to be drinking and picking up boys." Tough shit! Am I supposed to be responsible… for the morals of every girl in this goddamn house. These broads would hump the Leaning Tower of Pisa, if they could get up there. I do my best. I don't know what the bastards expect of me. Christ's sake! Claude? Is that you, Claudekins? Claude? Here kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty! Come on, Claude. Come say goodbye to Mommy! Is that you, Claude? Oh, Jesus! Claude, look what you made me do! Come on, Claude! Here kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty! Come on, Claude! I gotta go! Here, kitty! Oh, goddammit, Claude! You little prick! This is very kind of you, Mr. Harrison. Think nothing of it. ♫ I'm pregnant. What? I'm pregnant. God, Jess, that's fantastic! I don't want it. You don't want it? No. I want to have an abortion. You can't make a decision like that. You haven't even asked me. I wasn't even gonna tell you. Jess. I want us to have a baby. - Peter, I can't! - Oh, Christ, Jess. Don't you ever consider anyone but yourself? I've thought this out very carefully, and I know what I'm gonna do. Do you know how important this afternoon is to me? Yes, I do. Why don't you just get out of here. Jess! I want to talk to you tonight. There's nothing to discuss, Peter! I think there is! I'm not gonna change my mind! We'll see. Will you be there at nine o'clock? Yes. Okay, I'll see you tonight. Yes, dear. I'm sure there's nothing wrong. Yes, I've just been talking with a friend of hers. She's going to call around for me. Here, need some more, huh? Yes, well, if we don't have any luck, I'll go to the police. Yes. Well, I don't think I'll be home tonight. It's a bit late to head out now. I think the lil' bugger's schnockered, son of a bitch. - Eh, Shortie? - Yeah, goodbye, dear. You are, aren't ya? Hello? Hello? Hello? Oh hell, not again! Billy! Billy? I'm sorry, you have the wrong number. What your mother and I must know is… Where did you put the baby? You've got the wrong number. Where did you put Agnes, Billy? Look, I'm telling you, you have the wrong number! What your mother and I must know is" Billy! You guys can never get it together with a… Look, I really don't think you're taking this as seriously as you should. I mean, honestly. We may hear a non specific… Hold it, hold it! Jesus! Could you just give it to me one at a time? Well, what the hell are you planning to do about it? You… shut up! You know, for a public servant, I think your attitude really sucks. Shut up. Now, Mr. Harrison, if you're convinced your daughter is missing, you can fill out one of these forms. I don't know if it's any consolation, but 90 percent of the time girls who are reported missing from the college, they're at a cabin somewhere, with a boyfriend. Thanks, but that's not much consolation. Oh, here, Mrs. Mac, let me help. Thank you, dear. You know, we got to get Mr. Reynolds to fix this door. I must have called that son of a bitch a hundred times about it. Oh, Mrs. Mac, there was another one of those calls just now. Oh, was there, dear? It was weird! Some woman screaming, then a man wailing. Uh, Clare Harrison's father was here today. Oh, really? I'm sorry I didn't get to say goodbye to her. Well, you still might. Clare didn't meet him where she was supposed to. Uh, I thought she went over to the fraternity. Where is it? Eureka! Excuse me. Could you give me the number of the sorority house? Please. Yeah, sure. It's, uh… Fellatio… 2-0-8-8-0. What? Fellatio. It… It's a… It's a new exchange. I'FI'_'IEI'-. That's a new one on me. How do you spell it? Capital 'F', 'E', little 'I', 'I', IAI, UT', II', IO.- Thanks. Don't mention it. Chris! Hi, what's up? - Have you seen Clare today? - No, she went home. No she didn't. No one knows where she is. Are you serious? I thought maybe she was with you or at least you might have heard from her. No, not since last night. Well, her father came to pick her up at 1 o'clock today, and she didn't show. So he went down to the police station with Phyl and Barb. What happened? - They didn't take It urlously. - Why? I don't know. I think they figured she was shacked up somewhere. Well, um, she's out for Christmas holidays, but… there was a band practice over at the high school this afternoon, and… Janice plays the clarinet, and, uh, when she didn't come home, I-I thought Melody Green, that's her… best friend. And, uh, they hadn't seen her all day. She's only 13 years old, Lieutenant, and… my husband's a trucker, he's out on the road, and so I came over here. Yeah, well, is it really so unusual for her to be just a few hours late, Mrs. Quaife? Oh, yes. She should have been home at noon. We were gonna buy a present for her father. Nash, you stupid son of a bitch, you got a big goddamn mouth! What the hell are you talking about? Hi Chris, how's your brother? Ken, I gotta talk to you. What's up? I want to know why nothing's being done about Clare Harrison being missing, and why this… idiot gets away with saying the things he does? You're a friend of Clare Harrison? Yeah, I've been taking her out. Oh, this is Jess, Ken. She lives in the same sorority house as Clare. All right, come on in. Sergeant, bring me the file on the Harrison girl. And take care of this. At least you should try to eat something, Mr. Harrison. You know, starving yourself isn't going to help the situation at all. No, thank you very much, Mrs. MacHenry, but I just have no appetite. I feel I should be doing something, but I don't know what. Well, why don't you just try to stop worrying? The best thing you can do is stay right here. I'm sure she'll call or show up soon. If I just knew what to do. Did you know… it's a very little known fact, but… did you know that there is a certain species of turtle… there's a certain species of turtle… that can screw for three days without stopping. You don't believe me, do you? Well, I mean how could I make something like that up? Uh, Barb, dear, I… I… I… No, really, they just three days, 24 hours a day. Whoomp! Whoomp! Can you believe that? Three days? I'm lucky if I get three minutes. Do you know how I know this? Because I went down to the zoo, and I watched them. It was very boring. Well, actually, um, I, uh, didn't stay for the whole three days. I went over and I watched the zebras, because they only take 30 seconds. Premature ejaculation! You think it's my fault, don't you? Barb, stop it! Don't shit me! It's what you're all thinking. Why don't you just come right out and say it? You think that I drove her away… and if she's dead, you're gonna blame me. Barb, for God's sake! Well, that's what we're all thinking why doesn't someone just come right out and say it? Barb, dear, you've had too much to drink. Mr. Harrison… I don't give a shit about Mr. Harrison! I'm sick and tired of everyone in this house insinuating stuff and not coming out with what they mean. Barb, why don't you go upstairs and lie down for a while? Shut up! And you leave me alone, goddamn you! You think it's my fault, don't you? You've been implying it all afternoon! Barb, you're drunk! Go to bed! Yeah, sure. Fine. - Any news? - Yes! Where's Mr. Harrison? Uh, he-he's in the dining room. - We won't be long, Mrs. Mac. - All right, dear. See you later. - Uh, Phyl, - Yeah? Phyl, listen, I'm sure Clare will be all right. I hope so. And I just want to tell you that I'm going to go to my sister's for the holiday… …so I might not be here when you get back. That's okay. Look, just check in on Barb before you leave, could you do that? Of course, I will. And you bundle up. We'll be all right, Mrs. Mac. Mrs. Quaife… and Mr. Harrison have asked me to extend their thanks to you for coming out on this cold night to help. Now, Mrs. Quaife has told us that Janice most likely came through this park… on her way home from school today. So, the first thing we'll do is comb the park. When I tell you, I want you all to assemble on the south edge of the park with your assigned officer. Then, we'll just walk through the park. Spread out evenly! Don't bunch up. There'll be two sets of dogs leading the way. Just spread out and follow them. George and Carly… stay out on the flanks. The fumes 'II mess up the dogs, and don't go more than ten miles an hour. Or you'll be no use to us. Now if any of you find anything, I want you to send someone out immediately to report it to me. Is that clear? Are there any questions?

Why didn't you say something? Yeah? Well… you scared the hell out of me. Too. What was all that yelling about? I was upstairs having a little sleep. Hope you don't mind, but it got a little cold out there waiting for you. - Sorry, I was late, Peter. - Yeah. Clare Harrison is missing. I was out with the search party looking for her. - Yes, hello? - How noble. I want to report something. No, I don't want to hold! How did the recital go? How do you think it went? Peter, what kind of a game are you playing? I thought you wanted to talk. So why don't you quit attacking me and we try to have a rational, adult conversation? Yes, now stay on the line! Okay! Now calm down, lady. Let's have the story. Oh, yeah? What's the address? Six Belmont Street. How many calls? Well, did you call the phone company? Oh, yeah? Well, miss, we're very busy here. There's been a child murdered in the park. I don't know when we can get them out on it. It's probably just one of your boyfriends playing a little joke. Yeah. Well, I'll report it and try to get a man on it just as soon as possible. I'm sorry, Miss. Jess, what's wrong? A little girl was found murdered in the park. What? The search party that was looking for Clare found a little girl murdered. And Clare's still missing. Look, Clare's all right. Is she? Now listen, Jess, I know you're upset. But I've got something to tell you. Mm-hmm. I'm leaving the conservatory. - Petor. - Now, you just hear me out. Will you hear me out, please? Now, I've lived in one room for eight years, and I'm tired of it. I'm tired of having to line up behind six people every time I wanna take a bath. I've had it. I'm quitting the conservatory, and we're getting married. Well, say something. Do you remember when we first met? You told me about your wanting to be a concert pianist, how it was your greatest dream, and I told you about some of the things that I wanted to do? I still want to do those things. You can't ask me to drop everything I've been working for and give up all my ambitions, because your plans have changed. Be realistic. I can't marry you. Sure you can. What does it change? We could be married. You could still do anything you wanted to do. Peter, I don't want to marry you. All right. What about the baby? I didn't want to bother you with it, sir. Well, you didn't. Six Belmont Street, that's where your daughter lives? Yes, it is. A high school girl's been murdered. Mr. Harrison's daughter is missing. And now at the house where she lives, the other girls are getting obscene phone calls. Don't you think we ought to look into it, Nash? Well, Lieutenant, I guess, sure. Thank you, Lieutenant. Yeah, thanks Ken. Sergeant Nash. Could I speak to you for a minute? Yeah… sure, Lieutenant. What's this? That's the number at the sorority house. Fellatio? Yeah, it's the new exchange, llFll-"Ell. The new exchange? Yeah, fellatio. One of the girls that was in this afternoon gave it to me. She gave it to you? Yeah. Nash, I don't think you could pick your nose without written instructions. I know. Something dirty, ain't it? You selfish bitch. You're talking about killing our baby as though you were having a wart removed. Now, can you see why I didn't want to tell you? What the hell are you trying to do to me? What are you doing to yourself? Jess, Let's get one thing straight. You are not going to abort that baby. Peter, you're not gonna tell me what I can and cannot do. Jess, if you try getting an abortion… I think you'd better leave! If you try getting an abortion… I said get out! You're gonna be very sorry. Hi, Peter. I'll get Jess. - Jess, are you okay? - Yeah, I'm okay. Any more news? No, but there's some people here to see about the phone calls. Jess, this is Lieutenant Fuller, and, I'm sorry. Uh, Graham, Bill Graham. Are you the person who called the station today? Yes. I would like to put a tap on your phone. But we'll need your written permission to do that if it's okay with you? - 0kay. - Okay, Graham, You can go ahead. And I'd like to see Clare Harrison's room. - Sure. - Where's the telephone? Uh, there's one in the living room and one here in the hallway. Clare's room is up here. How many girls live in this house? Uh, usually ten. Hello, this is Lineman Graham, at Six Belmont. I'm working line 559-6114. Great. This afternoon, I got a call from a woman that I thought was a wrong number. But then she started screaming at me. Who was the last one here to see Miss Harrison? - I think I was. - When, approximately? Last night, about 10:30. Is this the way she left her room, as far as you know? Yes. What's this? We were having a party last night. She drink a lot? No, hardly at all. Does she have any emotional problems, anything like that? No, not Clare. Who was she seeing besides Chris Hayden? - No one. - Sure of that? So, you were the last one to see her sometime this morning? - Last night. - Right, last night. Well, did anyone see her this morning? - I didn't. And all the others girls have gone for the holidays. Can I get a list of their phone numbers where I can reach them? Sure. There's one in Mrs. Mac's room. - Who's Mrs. Mac? - She's the house mother. Is there anyone else in the house right now? Yes, another girl, Barbara Coard. She's upstairs asleep. Um, she's not feeling too well. Is she the one that was at the station today? Noah. Noah, we“. ht her shop. Okay. Were there any deliveries yesterday? Or was anyone working in the house, anything like that? No, I don't think so. Mrs. Mac would know. Is her sister's number on this list? Yes. Graham, how's it going? You about finished? Yeah. What I've done is, I've tapped this phone, so that when it rings, it'll ring at the station house, too. At the same time, I'll be at the phone company checking on the location of the source of the call. Are there any other phones in the house? Yes, the house mother has a line. Yeah, but it's another number, and there haven't been any calls on it You're gonna have to keep this guy on the line as long as possible. We got a mechanical system here and it takes a while. I know It's not very pleasant. But- Uh, girls, can I show you something? - See the car outside? - Yeah. We got one of our men In It, so you've got nothing to worry about. Yeah, sure. I just know Clare is dead. I can just feel it. Oh, come on now, Phyl, we don't know that. Poor Mr. Harrison! I feel so sorry for him! Hey, hey. How's Chris? Oh, he's okay. You know Chris. Oh, God. I'm sorry, Jess. I guess I'm just exhausted. I've been taking these pills for my cold and they knock me out. Will you be okay if I go up to bed? Yes, of course. Are you sure? Yes, go up and get some rest. Call me if there's any news. IWlll. Thanks. - Good night, Phyl. - Good night. ♫ Yeah, everything clear on your end Jeff? Okay. Sure. Uh, yeah. Now look, I'm gonna need about 10 more minutes. Now be sure you tell those people again they gotta keep this guy on the line. Right. 'Cause he hasn't worn his hat for the last two days. Yes, we certainly will look into that. Thank you very much. Jesus! Graham's nearly ready at the switching station. Now, when the phone rings at the house there, this one will ring, too. The transmitters have been removed, so, uh, we won't pick anything up at all from this end. Great, thanks. Lieutenant, the men are here from Scarborough.

If you laugh, Buchanan, I'll bust you to boy scout, I swear! If you think it was Peter, then why didn't you just tell the police? Well, because I'm not really sure. Well, he should be stopped. Whoever it is should be stopped. God, Jess, I haven't had a minute's sleep around here. There's been so much noise in the house. What the hell was all that yelling about? Barb had an asthma attack. She was having a nightmare. Is she all right? Yes, she's fine. She's sleeping now. He repeated almost word for word what Peter said to me tonight. Couldn't it just be a coincidence? Oh God, Phyl, I don't know. I'm so confused. Oh, look, Jess, I really don't think it could be Peter. You know, I don't like Peter much, but I don't think he's that sick. I don't believe Peter would do this. He's so gentle most of the time. Oh, God, Phyl! You know, I'm really getting scared? Look, are you sure that cop's still out there? Yep, he's there. Hello? Jess? Yes? Oh, God, please help me. Oh look, Peter, don't cry. We can straighten things out. There's nothing to get so upset about. - Yeah? - It's Bill Graham. You want me to trace that one? Yeah, try and get it. Right. Jess, Jess! We can't kill the baby! Please, Jess! We can't kill the baby! Peter, where are you? Please, Jess! You know how I feel about the baby. Don't do this. Jess, don't hurt the baby! - Stop this, Peter. - You want our baby… I know you do. I don't want to hurt this baby. Jess, please! Peter, please tell me where you are. I'm sorry. Yeah, the call's just aren't long enough! Right. Yes? Jess, Lieutenant Fuller. Do you want to tell me what that's all about? - You listened to that? - Yes. What did he mean about killing the baby? Jess, it's important that you tell me. I'm pregnant. I told him I didn't want to have the baby. When did you tell him this? Today. Just today? You're sure? Yes. "We can't kill the baby", that's a strange way of putting it. Peter's an artist. He's very high strung. Neurotic, maybe? No. No more than a lot of people. Jess, are you telling me the truth? I've got a feeling you're holding something back from me. Now, I don't want it to be Peter. But if it is, he needs help. Do you know what I mean? The sooner, the better. Now, look, think back. Was Peter with you any of the times that you got one of these calls? Yes! Yes, he was here! He was at the house tonight when the first call came! That's right! It couldn't be Peter! Phyl, it couldn't be Peter! He was here! Well, he's obviously upset about something. I'd like to talk to him. Can you tell me where I might reach him? Uh, well, he lives at Baker House. Uh, but when he gets like this, he usually goes down to the Recital Hall at the Music Conservatory and plays. Look, Jess, if you get any more calls, you're gonna have to keep him on the line longer. You're not giving us enough time to get a trace. I'm trying, you know, it really upsets me. Alright, of course. Look, you're doing fine. I'll talk to you later. Okay. Thank God! I knew it couldn't have been Peter. Well, what can I tell you? We covered the entire campus area. They're working their way toward the lake now. Where do we go from there? Start 'em out on the south end of town, have them work their way through town on a house-to-house. Jess, do you want one aspirin or two? - Two, please. - Okay! Jess! Jess! What are you doing? Some kind of a search party. Yes? Sorry to scare you, Miss, but we're with the search party. Well, what do you want? Well, we wondered if you'd seen anything peculiar tonight. Well, not until you got here. Well, they scared the shit out of me! Sorry, miss, but you do know there was a girl killed in the park tonight? Yes, we heard. Well, we're just helping the police to look for the killer. Well, we'd ask you in, you know… But our dog died last night. Oh, wow. Well… well, we don't want to bother you at a time like that. Uh, we were just wondering if you noticed anything suspicious here tonight? Oh, no. Sorry. Well, you just keep your doors and windows locked, and. uh, and you'll be safe. - Okay. - Do you understand? - Thank a lot. We will. And remember, there might be others from the search party around. So, don't be afraid. We'll be around seeing that you're safe. Thank you very… Remember to lock those doors and windows, now. - Okay, then. - Bye now. I'd rather face the killer! Seriously, do you realize this is the only door and window in this whole house that's locked? Get that Dean of Admissions on the phone. Tell him I want all records on a "Peter Smythe“, a music student, and have a car meet me out front. ♫ Barb? Are you awake? Agnes. Phyl! Are you there? Phyl! - Hello? - Hi! You pig! You fat pig! You pig! You bitch pig! Look at your little baby! No, Billy. No! Ouch! Help! Help! Help! Billy! Billy! Where's the baby? Where's Agnes? You left Billy alone with Agnes! - Billy! - Where's the baby? Where's the baby? Billy! Billy! Lieutenant! The guy's on the phone again! Come on, Billy's sick! I know you're there, nasty Billy! You answer me this minute! Mommy! Mommy! - Come here! - Mommy! Where's Agnes? Agnes! Give Mommy the baby! Baby's all right, Mommy! You have to find her. This is Graham. It's group 140, terminal 55. …Agnes in. Lieutenant Fuller? Yeah, Nash. What is it? Uh, phone company's on the other line, sir. They say they got a trace on this one. Yeah, let's have it. He says the calls are coming from number six, Belmont Street. For Chrissakes, Nash, you got it wrong. That's where the calls are going into. That's where they're coming from, too, sir. ♫ Oh, shit! Jennings? Jennings? Jennings! Jennings! Jennings, where the hell are you? Yes, sir. Look, I can't get through to Jennings. I want you to call that girl. Nash, be calm. Don't tell her that the guy is in the house. Just tell her to put down the phone and walk straight out the front door. I'll be there in five minutes. And Nash, if you blow this, I'll kill you. Phyl? Phyl! Where are you? Please answer me! Hello? Who is this? It's Jess. Uh, Miss Bradford, uh, this is Sergeant Nash. Are you the only one in the house? No. Phyl and Barb are upstairs asleep. Why? All right. Now, I want you to do exactly what I tell you without asking any questions, okay? No, no, no questions. Now, just put the phone back on the hook, walk to the front door, and leave the house. What's wrong? Please, Miss Bradford, please just do as I tell you. Okay. I'll… I'll get Phyl and Barb. No, no, no! Don't do that, Jess! Jess, the caller is in the house! The calls are coming from the house! Jess! Jess, get out! And don't go up there! Don't go upstairs, Jess! Miss Bradford! Miss Bradford! Miss Bradford? Miss Bradford? Barb. Phyl! Oh, please. answer me! Phyl! Barb! Please, answer me! Please, answer me! Please! Oh! Oh! ♫ Barb? Phyl? Agnes. Agnes, it's me, Billy! Agnes, Agnes, don't you tell what we did, Agnes. Jess? Jess? Are you all right? Jess? Jess, are you in there? Jess! Jess? Jess? Jess? Jess, is that you? Jess, are you in there? Jess? Jess, is that you? Jess, why didn't you answer me? What's all the yelling about? Jess, you had me worried. What are you doing down here? Jess? I knew it. I knew it in my gut. It was that kid. Why would Peter start killing people? I don't know. He must've made a call after… After each murder. It's hard to believe Jess would kill anybody, much less Peter! And she's under. How long do you think it'll be before I can talk to her? Just a couple questions. Well, she'll be out for at least four hours, pretty groggy after that. What time do her parents get here? A couple of hours. They're driving down from Unionville. I'll stay with her till then. With the condition she's in, I wouldn't count on talking to her before tomorrow afternoon, if I were you. Has anybody notified Patrick Cornell? - Who? - Uh, Phyl's boyfriend. Uh, Lieutenant! I think we're gonna have to take these bodies to the morgue in Lincolnville. The hospital doesn't have facilities to handle this many at one time. All right, tell the coroner, they have to get started on the autopsies right away. Then notify the parents for identification. Yes, sir. Uh, I think that about wraps everything up here, sir. Uh, state lab guys will be here in about an hour, they said. Uh, reporters, sir, and television news guys. They want pictures. Get them the hell out of here! Tell them I'll meet them down at the station, would you? All right, guys. C'mon! Move back downstairs! Is the Bradford girl being charged with… How 'bout a picture? All right, you guys. Come on, back off! Back off! Yes, the girl's father's upstairs but he can't tell you anything. Would you keep it down, please? We've got a sick girl in here. Come on, get out! Cowards! - Let's go, come on! - Come on, move it! He's in shock. Help me get him downstairs. He's got to go to a hospital. You should be all right, Mr. Harrison. She's gonna be back! I know it! Okay, give us a hand, here. Hey you! Nash, will you see that everything's wrapped up? All right, Lieutenant. will do. Hey, Lieutenant! Hey you! Come on! Out! Out! You want to spend the night in the can? Move! Jesus! What's the matter with this guy? He's suffering from shock. We have to get him to the hospital. Can you get us a car, Nash? Yeah, yeah, let's go! All right, McCloskey, you heard what the Lieutenant said! Right. Agnes! It's me, Billy!
