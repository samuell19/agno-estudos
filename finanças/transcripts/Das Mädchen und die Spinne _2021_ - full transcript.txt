Bedroom, Room, Bathroom, Kitchen. Printing: Floor Plan Lisa. pdf. THE GIRL AND THE SPIDER Hello? Second floor. Can you help with the drawers? In a minute. Hello. - Hey. Where have you been? Looking for parking. I finally found one. Okay. How's dad doing? - Fine. We'll see. He might show up. Hello. - Hello. Wow, folding doors... Quiet! Quiet! That dog is scratching the door. Did you bring the curtains? - Yes. Where's Mara? In the bathroom. Hello. Hello. And the bread buns? I brought those too. There’s mould in the bathroom. Mould and crying babies. - Hello. Have you got herpes? - Yes. Here... A present for you. The floor plan. Thank you. You’ll catch her herpes. Does it still hurt? No. I'm sorry. Quiet! Quiet! A year ago, we were on that bike trip. - Right. Once we lost sight of each other in a small town. I looked everywhere for you, in the streets, in the cafes. Suddenly, there was a fountain. I sat down next to it and closed my eyes. The water was splashing quietly. I almost fell asleep. Suddenly, I was surrounded by kids, jumping around and laughing. Some sat right next to me, as if I belonged to them. It was nice. I just sat there and listened to them. And wondered where you are, what you're doing. Suddenly, it fell silent again. I looked around, but the children had gone. As if the fountain had swallowed them up again. Just like that. The water continued to splash quietly. The wind was blowing little droplets away. As if they had never been there. Never. And then you found me again. Yes, then I found you again. You were sitting in a cafe, smoking. I watched you from afar. You looked beautiful. Free and beautiful. Do you have a cloth? Let go! Can you help me in the bathroom? Okay. Markus isn't helping? He's on his way, with the couch. Can I wash my hands? Thank you. Can I have one too? Hey Jan! Are you coming? What are you doing? Who are you? Eleni. Do you live here? - Yes. Do you like to draw? - Yes. Are you going to help us clean? - No. Do you want some bread? - Yes. Do you live upstairs or downstairs? Downstairs. Can you help me with the curtains? - Yes. How long have you lived here? Could you pass me the hammer? Here. - Thank you. What's your name? There really is mould in here. On the tile joints? - Yes. Astrid. How do you remove it? With a box cutter. Have you got one here? No. Idiot. And who are you? - Kira. Kira is helping us clean. This is where you’re hiding. - Hello. Karen. From downstairs. - With the baby? And the dog. And the cat! - That's right... And the cat! Hello. Hello! The previous tenant used to babysit them. I see. Hello. - Hey, hello! And your name is? - Lisa. Welcome neighbour! Hello. The cat is playing with the baby. And you are? My roommate. You're both moving in? - No, just me. The wardrobe is up. It's wobbly. - Yes, the floor is crooked. The previous tenant left a wardrobe in the cellar. Really? Was she nice? Yes. She was a flight attendant. So, she's flown away now? Exactly. And you've flown in. - Yes, I have flown in. I'm having a party at my old flat, you should come! I can't, I have the kids. - See, if you feel like it. Do you have mould too? - Yes, in the bathroom. You don't happen to have a box cutter? Yes. I'll bring it right up. Thank you. The cat scratched the baby. Now the baby's dead. Should I pile these in the stairway? Yes, that’s fine. Did you make that? Yes. On the computer? Yes, on the computer. When I went to print it, the PDF was suddenly jumbled. Jumbled? Yes. All the letters and lines were all scrambled up. It looked pretty. The symbols were in a chaotic order... The letters didn’t make sense as words anymore... So, I closed it and reopened it and suddenly, it went back to normal. The letters were words again. And the lines marked the floor plan again. I kept closing and opening it, hoping it would happen again. But it never did. Not even once. I thought PDF documents are unchangeable. It was a malfunction. Jan? Are you coming? You're bleeding. It wobbles. Lisa had conjunctivitis, once as a child. I put teabags on her eyes. She lay there quietly and didn't move. She had teabags for eyes. I sat beside her, until she fell asleep. Suddenly, it was so quiet. As if she'd stopped breathing. Then I got up and left. In the living room? Yes. Can you help me carry? - Me? It won't take long. Thank you. Bye. Bye! Hello. Hello? The box cutter. At your place... Is someone new moving in? The baby is screaming. I can't hear anything. Yes, it's screaming. Into the living room? - Yes. Hello. - Hi. Yellow? The colour of jealousy. - And of madness. Karen. Her new neighbour. Markus, her roommate and slave. I could do with one of those too. Here. Great. Now I can fight the mouldy tiles. Or kill your slave. Irina is moving in on Sunday. She asked if we could help her. Can you help me with the table? - Yes. Will you hoover up the drill dust, dear slave? My pleasure, Milady! Mother! Stop that! We have to get going. Quiet! Quiet! Don't touch anything! Where's the fuse box? - In the kitchen. I'll turn the light on. - Okay. The dog chewed the cable. I have to pee. Quiet! Quiet! Well, the fuse box is working fine. - At least that's something. The baby is screaming. You're right. Now it's screaming. It's a shame, it's not you moving in. I'm sure we would have fun together. Bye. Happy moving! - Thank you. Why did you pour coffee on Kira? Dogs get thirsty too. The kitchen counter is scratched. You're right. Here, if you ever need a job done. Jerzy Kowalski. Jurek. Jurek. Thank you. Okay, then. See you soon, Astrid. - Good bye, Jurek. Bye. Bye. Could you come a bit later tomorrow? Yes, that’s fine. - Great! I'll message you. Are you coming tomorrow too? - No, not tomorrow. Okay, maybe see you later. I'll see. - It'll be fun. Shall I take the cardboard down? - Yes. Hello. These band aids are breathable. Anything else? - No. That's 3.90. And your change. - Thank you. Good bye. - Bye. Are you going to help me? Is that mine? I didn't know, I still had it. You dyed it. - I know. Don't you want this anymore? - It's broken. As a kid, you used to have a down jacket too. Really? I told you, it had little birds inside it. And if you were really quiet, you could hear them. And if you pull a feather out, a bird dies. And did you ever pull one out? Probably not. - Yes. You did! But after that, the jacket scared you. You kept thinking about the little dead bird, trapped inside. Can you help me here? We'll take the doors off first. She's always refilling shelves. Like a robot. You're right. The other day, I saw her in a cafe. She was there with a friend. She suddenly seemed so lively. Like she was a different person. Are you going to help us? People will be arriving soon. Now, every time I see her, I remember that. Her laugh, that day. Can you go feed the cat? Her cheerful eyes. And I wonder what her voice sounded like. Are you a songbird? A nightingale! I sing when everyone else is asleep, so that my beauty is mine alone. Beauty can't be conserved. Not even a nightingale's. Behold! The queen has left her throne. The blue blood has gone to my head. I understand. Are you coming down for a smoke? Queens don't smoke! One last one! The tree of us, on my balcony. I have to pack. People will be here soon. I'll come! You can manage the wardrobe without me. Hamid! Stop it! That's not funny! Stop that! Quiet! Coming! - I'm sleeping! I'm not! Tea? Have you seen the cat? No. Did she run away? - I can't find her. Hi Kerstin. Hi Markus. I'm feeding the neighbours' cat. Without your glasses? They broke. You've got something... Kerstin is turning into a chicken. And you, a snowman! You're right... And I, a snowman. And together you're a snow hen. Now you're an Indian. I've always wanted a chicken. Will you lay eggs for me for breakfast? Of course. I'll squeeze out as many as you like. Warm, round eggs. Warm... round... eggs. Oh, shit! When are they back? - Next week. Do you miss them? - Yes. Is everything okay? - A door slammed shut. And shattered the glass panel. And woke Nora up! Who lives here? The Kramers. They're on holiday. Markus is feeding their cat. Right, the cat! Maybe she's upstairs. With Mrs. Arnold. Right. Why? The cat went missing once, for a few days. But they found her again. - Yes, at Mrs. Arnold's. At Mrs. Arnold's? - Yes. One day, the neighbour saw cat food in Mrs. Arnold’s grocery bag. Even though she doesn't have a cat. The washing machine is playing up! It's traumatised... by your underwear. In ecstasy, more like! That's Nora, my roommate. The queen of the night. During the day, she sleeps. And at night she silently roams the apartment. Every other day, she goes to the gym at nightfall. Darkness is her skin. The night, her best friend. And sunlight, her death. What happened? Astrid took the wardrobe apart. Hello? Hello. She was at my door. There she is! Thank you. Bye. Bye. Now, he's a chicken too. Right. Now he's a chicken too. So the neighbour found cat food in Mrs. Arnold's shopping? Yes. After that, she always thought that her cat was with Mrs. Arnold. She couldn't stop it. Especially at night, she thought, she could hear her cat's meow through the ceiling. Then she went to the janitor, he had keys to every flat. He laughed and said she was crazy. But one day, he went into Mrs. Arnold's flat and found the cat. Right. He picked up the cat and returned it to the neighbour. The next day, she saw Mrs. Arnold in the stairway. Mrs. Arnold tried to smile. But she had tears in her eyes. Then she disappeared silently in her apartment. Will you take my washing out? Yes. Since then, some nights, I think about Mrs. Arnold. How she sits alone in her big room and thinks about the cat. And her big bed. Perfectly made up, in the empty room. Are you coming? Hello. Hello Emma! Bye Mara. Bye. See you tomorrow. See you tomorrow. Bye. Your piercing. Yes, I took it out. Now you have a hole under your lip. Can you squirt wine out of it? I'm sure I can. Stop it! My blister will burst. The handy man is here! You came after all. Who's that? He helped at Lisa's today. Something funny happened yesterday. I was in my room, while Lisa was on the toilet. We're out of toilet paper! Coming. She asked me to bring her a roll of toilet paper. Instead of giving it to her, I walked past the door. From left to right... From Lisa's point of view. Then I walked past a second time. This time, walking back, from right to left. And eventually, a third time. Suddenly, Lisa had to laugh. When I walked past the door, the second time, Lisa wasn't looking. She thought that I walked from left to right twice. Without turning around in between. Like a ghost. Can you imagine that? That's what made her laugh. Markus is moving out too, soon. Hello. Hello. Another beer? Yes. You too? No. I'll be right back. Can I roll myself one too? Yes. Thank you. Good morning. - Hello. Good morning. Morning. - Morning! What about dad? He couldn't make it. Did you tell him, not to come? - Of course not! We'll see, he might still come. Coffee? - Yes, please. Hello. Hello. I knocked my head on the window. Good morning! - Morning. Now you've got a herpes blister too. Thanks for that. - Something to remember me by. Here, I grew it myself. Thank you. Pretty. Has the van arrived yet? - No, Jurek isn't here yet. My clothes. They want to get drunk. Are you taking the lamp too? - Yes. Can you get the ladder? I'm taking the coat rack too. - I know. Can you help him carry? - No. You’re covered in fluff. I left a paper tissue in the wash. Stupid. Coffee? Yes. Here. - Thank you. Was the party good? - Yes. Are you taking the dishwasher? - Yes. It's mine. Can I help you? - No. Can I put Lucky in your room? I have to go to the car. Yes. I hope Irina is more relaxed emptying the dishwasher. I hope she can stand living with you. You'll stay in this dump until you kick the bucket. Fuck you! Later. First, I'm moving out. What are you doing? Have you got dirt on your forehead? What are you drawing? I'm decorating Lisa's new flat. - Are you an architect? Yes. No, you're not. You're right, I'm not. What are you then? A liar. A drawer. Did you draw this? No, a girl at Lisa's new place. Will Lisa come visit us? I'm sure. I had a dream last night. We met up in town. You looked good. Older, but good. We talked and... we laughed. You said, you were tense. You pulled up your sweater and... I gave you a massage. Your shoulders... Your back... Then I noticed a smell. Your smell. That your clothes and your skin are dirty. I wanted to stop touching you, but I couldn't. I just continued, pretending I hadn’t noticed. But you noticed. That something was different. You looked at me. You tried to smile. But you had tears in your eyes. Then I left. I brought some blankets. For the furniture. Hello. Hello. I bumped my head. - On the window. Yes. It opens when there's strong wind. Hello. Hello. Why are you wearing a wig? Because she's the blue queen. - Because she's crazy! Hello. Careful! Hi! - Everything okay? Yeah. What's wrong with your shoes? They squeak. They sing. The air cushions must be broken. Really? Are you coming? I'll take a look at your window. When I was pregnant with Lisa, I often dreamt, my hair fell out. One day, I cut it short, and had this wig made out of it. In case, one day, I really lose all my hair. And every time, I had that dream, I got up and looked at it. How it was lying there... Motionless. Like a... small... animal. But now, you don't have that dream anymore? No. I don't have that dream anymore. Is this mattress coming too? No, the new girl is taking it. The table too. Should I take the table apart? - No, it's staying here. Hello. Hello! Up so early, nightingale? My nest is occupied. Are you ready to take off again, beautiful bird? Ready to crash and fall. Where's Markus? - He's in the cellar. Can you pack that? Are you going to help? Mother! Are you taking the piano too? - No. It belongs to the chamber maid. What chamber maid? - She used to live here. I only ever heard her. Playing on her piano. Like a ghost. To me, she was a friend. Didn't she work in a hotel? That's right. In the restaurant. She didn't enjoy it though, because she didn't like talking to people. Every time, she took an order, she was so nervous that she forgot everything. So, they sent her to clean the rooms. She had to check, if the rooms were cleaned properly. At first, she liked it, because she didn't have to talk to anyone. But after a while, she got bored. She wanted to clean the rooms herself. That was her favourite thing to do. Every time, she walked into a room, something was different. The furniture had moved. The room had a different smell. She found that fascinating. One day, she was fired. She was very sad. She stayed in her room and hardly ever played the piano. And suddenly she disappeared. And where did she go? On a cruise ship, where she could clean rooms in peace. Since then, her piano is here in the room. And her things in a box in the cellar. Maybe she's still somewhere on a ship, and at night, in her cabin, she thinks about her piano. How it's standing in her room, someone playing on it. Maybe one day, she'll come back. Maybe. Hello. - What are you doing here? The door was open and I... - Are you going to help? I can. Excuse me. Did you sleep well? Who are you? Jan. Your roommate told me, you'd be up here. Is she awake? But not dressed yet. I think you'd like her. Did he sleep at hers? Yes. You stink. Every flower has its scent. Now you don't stink anymore. You're my deodorant. And you’re my rose. Hello. Hello. What's wrong with the vacuum? It got chewed at. - By Kira. Exactly. Hello. - Hello. Can I roll myself one? - Yes. Here. From up here, everything looks different. Buzz buzzing the fly comes in... From ear to ear, humming. What happened to your piercing? You without your glasses. Me without my piercing. Less is more. We just have to be careful, it doesn't turn into too much. Or too little. It's a shame. What is? That you're moving away. I'm not moving away. Markus! You lied. I lie without batting an eyelid. And I make droplets, without opening my mouth. Bravo! Do it again. No. - Please. No. My ex left me, because I kept squirting wine through my hole. I understand. What would make you leave her? Her restlessness. She'd constantly compare me to other men. Ask herself, if I'm worth it. I'd always be scared of losing her. With time, you'd start comparing her to other women too. To spite her. And that wouldn't be enough. So, I'd have to kill her to fall in love with someone else. But I'd wish she wasn't dead. So, we could be crazy together. Forever. And that would be normal for both of us. And sometimes, she'd squirt wine out of the hole under her lip. And it would drip onto your beautiful chest. And she'd lovingly stub out her cigarette on it. And I wouldn't even feel it. No pain. Because she'd do it so lovingly. Do you know why I came to the party yesterday? You wanted to see me. I thought that... - That I liked you. There's a fly there. I don't like you. But maybe the fly likes you. I'm going to kill it now. Now, no one likes you. Can you give me a hand? To take the curtain down? Everything is falling apart. Now I'm a ghost. You're right. Now you're a ghost. How are you getting on? The hinge is jammed. Some windows don't want to be shut. You just have to force them. Then they shriek loudly. Really shrill. Until it drives you crazy and you shatter the glass with your fist. And then it's quiet again, and the window open. Until someone comes to fix it. Then a hand comes, strokes his arm, his shoulder, his neck. Until he turns to stone, and leaves the window be, forever. And the window is happy then. And so is he. It fell down. The other day, I wrote you an email and something strange happened. Really? A death cross suddenly appeared in the email. A death cross? - Yes. I realised that I accidentally pressed a keyboard shortcut. The T and Alt keys. Of course, I deleted the cross right away. And I tried the shortcut again. Again, the cross appeared. But this time, it was intentional. Which you deleted too. Yes. I deleted that one too. Otherwise, you'd have sent me a death cross. Or two. It's strange. I've never felt like you're my mother. The sound system is broken. Does the chamber maid not want her piano back? No. She buried it here. This room is its coffin. Where are the blankets? They're here! - Can you bring them down? In a second. - I'll unscrew the hose... He's taking a look at the washing machine. I'm the one paying him! Why are you carrying it downstairs? - I'm moving out. And why? - Because. Shit! Why is she moving out? Because you're annoying. - Give that back! Yes! - No. Yes! It gives you cancer. Hey Emma! - Quieten down! Let go! Quiet! Why does she never leave her bedroom? Because she has no skin. She can't protect herself. Isn't she sad all alone? Yes, she is sad. She longs for people. But she melts into other people, like liquid lava. And the separation is so painful, that she breaks apart. That's why she stays in her dark room, until one day, she won't wake up. And until then, all she feels is her loneliness... her desire and her pain. Nothing else. Have you got the keys? Right, the cat! Here. Markus broke the neighbours' door. Yes. Yesterday, when I was airing the flat out. Okay, I'll take a look. Can you hand me the screwdriver? Thank you. You're welcome. The blankets. It's working again. Right, it's working again. I like you. She's waking Nora up. Hello. Hello. Can you hand me that bottle there? The bottle. Thank you. What's your name? I should get going... Your name? Jan. Bye. - Stay! No. Stay! Can you bring me that shirt there? Get it yourself. Do you know why she brought you to me? No. Yesterday, I was at the gym. I was sitting at a machine and I... I was doing this exercise. I could only look in one direction, because I had to repeat the exercise. And there was a man in front of me. I had to look at him, the whole time. Even though I didn't want to. He was handsome. His skin... The way he moved. His hair. I realised that I would think about him at home. And that I'd hate having to think about him. That's why I wanted to look away. But I couldn't. I had to repeat the exercise. She brought you to me, to torture me. Because she knows, that I will keep... thinking about you. About your skin... Your hairline... Your smell. And that I'll sleep until she comes back and wakes me. To then keep thinking about you. Every time I wake up, I'm amazed, how many there are. Men like you. And she finds them all. She finds them all and brings them home to me. Stop that! Emma! That's enough now! Stop it! Stop it! Emma! Stop it now! Come. - Are you crazy? Hello. Hello. Stay. Markus! Markus, are you coming? Are you two crazy? - Could you be any louder? Shut your mouth! It's not funny! - Hey! Pop sleeping pills! Asshole! Listen, don't do that again! Close the door! - Emma, what are you doing? Stop that! Enough! Let me go! - Get away from there! Quiet! Quiet! Quiet! Are you crazy? What are you doing? When I was a girl, there was a spider in my room, right above my bed. When my mother wanted to take it away, I started screaming at the top of my voice. My mother asked me, what was wrong. I told her that the spider, came to visit me every night. Only then, could I fall asleep. So, she left the spider there? Yes, she left it there. Until one day, it was gone. All that was left, was its web. But then, that disappeared too. Are you coming? We have to go. Since I'm on this ship, I feel dizzy. It's always swaying. I stagger and am amazed I don't fall. Amazed that no one falls. And I ask myself, how the candle sticks in the saloon don't tip over. How the vases don't slide over the table edge. The lamps don't crash against the walls. Everything seems magnetic here. As if a secret force, were holding everything together. The ship's own force. Like a majestic castle, it glides across the waves. Floating peacefully through a dream. My dream. From which I keep waking up. Because the sun brightly pierces my eyes, grabbing into the ocean. So, there I stand. Motionless. As the ship continues to float across the glistening water. Only at night, does it let me shut my eyes. And rocks me gently to sleep. I then imagine the whales, the starfish, the anemones. All those wondrous creatures I'm floating above. And I imagine, one day, to sink down into it. Into this dark kingdom of silence, that is calling out to me. But for now, I stumble on, through the corridors. Through the saloons, the cabins, while I wonder, if anyone else notices that everything is swaying. Maybe the passengers that come and go, who stay behind as traces, in my hazy head. Only the seagulls are always there. Constantly. My friends, outside. They squawk horribly. I think about my piano. I imagine someone playing on it. Accompanying the song of the seagulls. And I look out at the sea. A smile on my face, because I imagine someone standing next to me, as the moonlight settles around us. And so, we stand. Listen to the seagulls squawk, as if they were singing a song. An unusual song. A song, for us alone.
