A seeing-eye dog is trained... to safely guide the blind One morning, five puppies were born at the home of Ms. Mito Mr. Tawada? It's Mito from Tokyo Labradors are either pure black or white, however... One of the puppies had a spot on its belly, very unusual for a Labrador This was Quill Hello, Mr. Tawada? This is Mito Good puppy... Hello, Mito here May I speak with Chief Tawada? Mr. Tawada? I've 5 new born labradors and I'd like my puppies trained as guide dogs Impossible. The mom is too ordinary The qualities we are looking for... are hereditary Slowly... Are you sharing? Behave... Hello, Mr. Tawada. It's Mito again OK, you win. But just one Mr. Tawada... How do I choose which one? They're all so smart Try calling them Come! Come! Good puppies! There's technique in choosing potential guide dogs The ones that come right away are out Those are too active The right one is the one that... stops and looks as if to ask "What's the fuss?" You are not... an ordinary puppy So be good! This was Quill's first parting Here it is Thanks All papers are done. Made it alive? When it's 45 days old and ready to leave its mother the puppy is brought... to the "puppy walkers" before it's taken to the training centre They're volunteers who raise puppies till their first birthday Like foster parents Puppies will learn to be humans' friends First there was R for "Ran", then J for "Jonah"... Let's use Q for the 3rd one Good idea! Q for... Q-taro! They must also give the puppy a name Quill: Large stiff feather Very cool Quill Qoo! Qoo! Scared? Unhappy? I feel the same way They are very excited to welcome Quill Here we are! Looks a bit tired It's the drugs for the flight What's this cross? It's a spot Looks like a flying bird Indeed You shouldn't scold this puppy Why is that? It's not the right way to teach puppies This is your home, Qoo And this is the garden Under their loving care... the puppy will learn... to love and trust humans and to be humans' friends He's waking up This is the first game Quill learned Puppies grow remarkably fast at this age Qoo!
