(crowd chatting indistinctly) (plane roaring) [President Trump] We're honored to have the Crown Prince with us. Saudi Arabia's been a great, great friend and a big purchaser of equipment and lots of other things, and one of the biggest investments of the United States. (traffic humming) (contemplative piano music) [Anna] I'm a US intelligence officer. Well, actually I'm not, but I spent just over two decades thinking I was. What I was and still am is a spy. I'm not rich. I don't fly on private jets. I don't even fly business class. I look and act entirely ordinary. This is the story of how I found out who I really was, how I became what I am now. Why are you here? [Leila] He isn't coming. [Anna] I've got a car. Is that backpack all the luggage you have? [Leila] Yes. [Newswoman On Radio] Are motivated purely by the attack on the United Kingdom, the attack on a British citizen, and his job. This is the first time... They came and took him in the middle of the night. I was in the bathroom. I don't think anybody knew that I was in there. How long have you known, about Daniels? We were going to get married. [Anna] Do you have any money? Yes, some. I'm gonna need you to leave that, okay? Go. [Newswoman On Radio] We have provided medical services. Some of these from the United States and the mainland. We're meeting with doctors, ongoing various levels of testing and at any point if someone feels like they are experiencing some symptoms that are similar to the symptoms that others affected have experienced, they can then go in for testing. But beyond that, I'm not gonna discuss the specifics. [Anna] I just spent four years in Saudi Arabia. Two days prior to my arrival in Los Angeles, nearly all the members of my crew were killed. By whom I did not yet know. I was lucky to make it out. I was saved by a discovery made by my commanding officer, Roger Daniels. He was who I was supposed to pick up from the Los Angeles airport. Instead, I was met by a woman who, however caring, should not have known of Daniels' intention to flee. (traffic humming) (contemplative piano music) (phone ringing) He's gone. His fucking girlfriend came. I know. You did the right thing. She'll be safe. We'll make sure of it. - [Anna] Yeah. I'm gonna take care of everything for you. We'll send somebody. (girl screaming) Tomorrow we'll have lunch and then we can talk. - Yeah. - [James] As long as you need. Sure, James. [James] I promise. Of course. (Anna panic breathing) It's not your fault. One, two, three, four. You know what, Daniels? I haven't told you my name. Daniels, Daniels, do you wanna dance? Thought you said you ain't married. Do you wanna dance? [Daniels] Take your hand off her. Thought you said you ain't married. I ain't married. Boop! Whoa, all right. I ain't playing games with you. This some kind of swinger's thing, huh? Bartender. Keep it. Fuck this shit. How are you? You were hard to find. Oh. Does that ruin your night? [Peter] Here. Here. You know what? Let's get the fuck out of this shit hole. The drinks are shit. Goodnight. You know what, buddy? This is for you. All right, come on. (sirens wailing) - Here. - Just put it over there. Please. Will you just open this in front of me? (Anna sighing) You got it? - Got it. 6:00 am. Yes, sir. We should probably go to bed. Yeah. Good luck. What? You're not staying the night? Goodbye. (Anna laughing) Oh. Because you're married. Never stopped you before. Hmm. You're a coward. (Peter sighing) (alarm clock buzzing) (water running) (traffic humming) (lighter flicking) (engine revving) Never seen you before. (turn signal clicking) Oh, you're not gonna talk? [Driver] I've only been told to drive you to S. You know who I am then? [Driver] I do. [Anna] There must be some rumors about me. [Driver] Some. Hello. Hi. Is 34 not joining us? 34 is no longer assigned to you. We worked together before. Do you remember? Iraq? Yes. So you're S now? Yes, 35. Has Daniels been found? He's dead. You arranged for him to board the 4:15 flight? Yeah. Yes. The woman, did you know her? Yes, uh, socially. I thought they might have slept together, but I, um, I didn't understand the extent of it, no. Well, it is unfortunate that your crew was not more discreet. You lost seven. Yes, the whole cell? And then you fled. So, no one left in Jeddah. I think that the best option for everyone concerned at this point would be for you to simply retire. 34 promised to convert the mission from NOC to Official Cover to provide for a pension for when the mission was over. The mission is not over. You have failed, again. And I'm sure whatever was promised to you was based on some form of success. The agency has no record of you, Miss Broad. You are not an agent. You are a petroleum engineer. In light of recent events, I'm sure you can agree that due to the size, the intimacy of the industry, I am not, um, hire able right now as an engineer. You're the only other employer I've ever had. I have less than $2000 left. You, you have consistently earned a very generous combined income. What's not in those pages that you need me to say? Is there not one that says I'm a fuck up? I'm asking for some compassion from someone who's been in the field, who understands that sometimes you, you can't come back once you've gone out. Please. (Anna sighing) Please. The King's children are mostly fuck ups. So he keeps them in the palaces. Or they can go to school in America. The Saudis, for a number of years, have employed the same tutor in Los Angeles. His current pupil is one of MBS's half-sisters, and evidently they are very close. Okay. This tutor has been identified as being susceptible to women, although rather inept with them. If you were to, say, become his girlfriend, for instance, that might provide an advantage to the stability of our alliance. Isn't there something that's more aligned with my background? [S] You said yourself you're unhireable as an engineer. Well, I just expected different from- Oh, you think we have something in common. Well, Miss Broad, take my advice. This is a very generous offer. No need to decide on this call. And you want to keep James as your point person, we can arrange that or a fresh start all around. Sometimes that's best in a situation like your own. I trust, I like James. [S] Good. We're done here. [Anna] I could've retired 10, maybe 12 years ago if it weren't for the thousands of hotel old-fashions and a Middle Eastern coke habit. All these old men knew I was high. [James] Hey. [Anna] But James was the only one who'd stay out with me, walk me home, not want anything out of it. I tried recruiting him myself couple of years ago. Just offered him a job. He didn't really know from whom. But, uh, cover story was great, fantastic salary. Just a little feeler for him, but he totally shot me down. Met this woman in law school and, uh, fell in love with her. He was supposed to follow her to New York. For some reason she decided to go without him and left him with a broken heart. Something like that. He's a lawyer and a tutor? Well, no, he's essentially just a tutor. I mean, if the kids go to USC or UCLA, he tutors them. If they go to Pepperdine or LMU, he winds up taking their classes for them. The families give these enormous donations. The schools are not too particular. Was first in his class at Cambridge. Senior Wrangler. Smart kid. But I can't get over this idea that he's kind of dopey. Sort of like a hopeless romantic. I didn't do this to become a whore. Sweetie, you did this for the same reason that everybody does. You were too arrogant to take on a regular job, and the agency gave you the opportunity to live the life of an unfettered narcissist. I mean, really. You get to live this whole make believe life. It's wonderful. It's fun. There's no reason pretending it's anything else. Yeah, it hasn't felt that way. It hasn't in a really long time. Well, then fuck it. You know, the problem with most people is it takes them entirely too long to realize that their future is a great, big bag of nothing. I was promised a pension. Then you leverage it. This whole business is about finding an opportunity, just one opportunity, and then you pounce. Life is full of unintended consequences, both good and bad for everybody. His name is Camden. It's up to you. How soon can you get me a wire? Monday. If you need some cash today, just ask. I'm asking. [Announcer] The red, white and blue. It's a beautiful sight tonight, isn't it? It spells freedom, tonight. (crowd cheering) [Anna] When I first saw him, I resented the fact that no one mentioned that we looked alike, as if it weren't the key motivator in their thinking of me. I hated him for this, and I hated how he echoed the worst parts of myself. A loner. Dour. Drawn to the places he least fit in. He was shy like me, too. He followed a group of girls for over an hour trying to muster the courage to flirt. (crowd chatting indistinctly) (soft dramatic music) Okay. There was something romantic about how he played his piano for himself. Turned out the lights for no one. Read for no one. I followed him like this for weeks. Seeing what he did, where he went, what I could use against him. The more I plotted, the more nervous I became, as if attraction can only be seeded with strangers. Uh, I'll have a large dark roast. Large dark roast, please. Good, good choice. Thank you. [Barista] You're welcome. Hey! Fuck. [Fahda] Camden, my god. How long have you been out here? Mo! - [Camden] Not long. Good afternoon. (speaking in Arabic) No one offered him a drink? No, they did. I'm good, thanks. I was thinking it's probably good timing for you to go and take the test for yourself tomorrow. I've devised a plan for today. Is there a problem for our arrangements for tomorrow? No, no, it's just- What? Some of the others in your cohort are ruffled at times. I think it's good if you give the next one a go. Yes. We will talk about this very soon. I have a gift for you right now. You will be very happy. For your hard work. Thanks, that's really not necessary. No, no. You are lonely. Makes me sad. Mo is sad, too. So, we go out tonight. We rent you a club. Club corner. Wahid looked into a club, then realized, where are all the people coming from? So, we'll do a club corner. I don't think that's wise. Such a public place. I'm trying to help you. Thank you. (sirens wailing) (upbeat dance music) (pulsing dance music) What is it that you do? Huh? What do you do? [Tammi] He's a writer. [Camden] I'm a writer. We're influencers. (Fahda laughing) (pulsing dance music) Will you excuse me, please? (pulsing dance music) (crowd noise) [Anna] I've never seen you here before. [Camden] I've never been here before. Do you come here a lot? [Anna] Yeah. I'm out here like almost every night. You wanna go for a smoke? Okay. Thank you. Why did we come out here and not the smoking area? It's super crowded in there. And everyone wants to bum a cigarette. Good thinking. (Anna clicks her tongue) (people talking indistinctly) So did you come here with anyone else? Yeah. Should we join them after we finish? Okay. [Woman] Oh, go ahead. You guys going in? Uh, yeah. [Woman] Okay, go ahead. (pulsing dance music) [Mousa] No strangers. I know her. [Mousa] From where? She lives in my neighborhood. [Anna] It's okay. No. I never ask for anything. I can vouch for her. (pulsing dance music) These aren't my friends. They're okay. I mostly prefer to be alone. Do you want me to leave? No. I do have to go to bed soon, though. (pulsing dance music) Do you want my number? You want, you want to see me again? Give me your phone. I'm Camden. I'm Anna. (phone ringing) (phone beeping) Hello? Are you comin'? Oh, wait. ID? Really? ID. No, don't close that. Welcome back, Ms. Bin Sal man Al Saud. - [Camden] Thank you. - [T.A.] Yeah. (door slamming) (ring tone chiming) Hello? All right. All right, I'll be there. Those that wish to harm her majesty have produced compromising photographs, oral sex with a business associate. They were taken at the club? I don't remember. Please, talk to them. This is something I know you can fix. Will you talk to them? Yes, of course. What if I can convince them to hand them over without payment. (Wahid chuckling) I don't think, but yes, whatever's good for the family. (suspenseful music) (keyboard clicking) (phone ringing) Anna. I was just calling to see if you wanted to do something. Yeah, I have to work tonight. Tonight. Okay. Yeah, yeah, I guess. I have to meet a guy later at a coffee shop, but then we could meet there afterwards. Say, 8:30? (women laughing) Hi. Hey. Do you wanna go someplace else? Yeah. Cool. I know this, this bowling alley that's only open for special events, and it doesn't have a security camera. You wanna break in? I'm kind of in this risk aversion period right now. Oh, okay. Um, well, it's safe, that's what I'm saying, but I, you don't have to trust me. I, um, I'll go wherever you want. (suspenseful music) [Camden] Nice Vorax. [Anna] Thank you. How did you know that? [Camden] I don't know. [Anna] Yeah, you do. My dad was a locksmith. You wanna ask me something? I don't know. [Anna] Come on. You can ask me anything. What's your favorite smell? (chuckling) I say anything and that's all you got? What are your views on blackmail? Roses are my favorite smell. It's a cliche, but cliches are good. That's why they're cliches. And, uh, I think blackmail should be legal. No one thinks that. Why not, though? It's a free market exchange. Well, blackmail typically involves an exchange setting with a bilateral monopoly over normally highly emotional stakes. And there's the advertising element. Well then don't advertise. No, I mean the law. Its main purpose is publicity. (lock clicking) [Anna] What should I put? [Camden] What do you mean? [Anna] For the scoreboard. [Camden] Oh, um. I'll just take the yellow ball. No, I meant initials. Wait, have you never bowled before? Uh, no. [Anna] Holy shit. Really? I'm sorry. No, no, no. No, it's good. I'm just, I'm honored to introduce you to such an apple pie pastime. Do you want me to teach you? Okay. [Anna] See these two arrows right in the center? [Camden] Yeah. Aim right between those two, but to the right a little bit, okay? Yeah. Okay, um, watch this. One step, two step, forward, release on the third step. Got it? Yeah, should I go? Sure! (ball thudding) (pins clattering) Holy shit! I'm an amazing teacher! You are? No shit! Did, seriously, did you? You were part of some, like, high school league or something? No, no, I wouldn't joke about something like that. Well, then you're just a fuckin' prodigy. Here I go. (ball thudding) (ball thudding) Okay, that was just a warm up. I mean, I would get to go twice either way, technically. The only reason you went once is 'cause you couldn't go again, so. I don't mind. You can go as many times as you like. Well, that's not really how it works. Okay, but we're just doing this for fun, right? Doesn't matter. Well, what's the, what's the point of that? I just want you to have a good time, that's all, and just not worry about me. Okay. (ball thudding) (ball thudding) Okay, that was just a warm up. You're doing great. I probably just have beginner's luck. [Anna] Uh. Okay, are you fucking with me still? No. That's just how I feel. I like to tell the truth. I know that's not always the best way sometimes, though. What? What? Nothing. No. Seems like you want to say something, so say it. Do you wanna leave or whatever? Just, if you want to, just say it, okay? Get it over with so we don't have to waste time here. It's just, I don't feel comfortable with people very often, but it's not as bad with you. It's not as bad with me. No. [Anna] We talked late into the night, sharing the sort of details that seem untrue when you first meet someone. To my own weakness, I found myself telling the truth. How I'd left home early, how my mom died young, how I never knew my father. Where'd you grow up? His Italian father was 72 when he first had him, which made me assume he must've been kind or at least romantic. Which is where my mother's still lives. [Anna] His mother's American, but chose to raise him in Europe. I ran to LA. He came as a writer seeking roots he never had. I want to write a novel about it one day. At least I want to. Do you have something like that that you want? Yeah. Where did you grow up? The Badlands. You know where that is? Of course. (Anna chuckling) I always wanted to go. And then I moved to China. Then a whole lot of other places. And I haven't been here really long. China. Yeah. Why China? Well, um. Where I'm f r om, if you wanted to see the world or do something really exotic, you became a petroleum engineer. (chuckling) So they had a, they had a pretty good school for that there and it was free. So, you've seen a lot of the world? Mmm. Yeah. Do you wanna have a family? I don't think I do. Do you? I don't even know if I still can. Never really tried, so. I guess... I don't know. I don't think I ever did. Really? I do want to get married, though. Never gotten close. Have you? Nah. Maybe I got close once, but it's hard with my job, travel. Where do you live in LA? Well, I am currently staying in a shitty motel until I figure that out. Sorry. Yeah, kinda sucks. What if I stay with you tonight? Oh, I, I don't think so. That was stupid. Forget that I said that. I'm just thinking, I don't think I've ever had someone sleep before. I only have one pillow. It's no big deal. I don't even need a pillow. Would you like to sleep the night? Yeah. (Anna chuckling) (kiss smacking softly) Okay. (kisses smacking softly) (Anna chuckling) What are you reading? I'm not reading it. "Jane Eyre". So it's just academic decoration? No. Then you're reading it. I'm not reading it. I read it when I don't feel well. But I feel good now, so I'm not reading it. You can just tell people you're reading it. They won't know why. Okay. Goodnight. - Goodnight. (Anna gasping) [Anna] Don't touch me! One, two, three, four. One, two, three, four. [Camden] I'm sorry. [Anna] Fuck, I'm sorry. I should go. [Camden] It's okay. [Anna] No, it's fine. I should go. (Anna panic breathing) [Camden] Are you going to Uber to our cars? [Anna] Yeah. [Camden] Can I come with you? Yeah, of course. You're sweet. What? You're sweet. You're a sweet person. You are, too. (Anna chuckling) Bye. Thanks. (door closing) (engine starting) (Anna sighing) Fuck! (window whirring) (contemplative synth music) (phone ringing) I just wanted to, I just wanted to say you didn't do anything wrong. I just, I, I have problems that make it difficult for me to sleep in places I don't know. [Camden] That's okay. You sure? I understand. I've got some things that I struggle with, but I'm working on them. Last night made that easier for me. Can I buy you dinner tomorrow? I don't think that's a good idea. Okay, um. [Camden] I don't have any plans, I just, I'm on call, that's all. Well, you're on call. You get a call, you get up. Will you come with me? I'd like that. [Anna] Okay. Okay, uh, well, I'll, uh, find us a place. Bye, Camden. Goodbye, Anna. (soft dramatic synth music) [Anna] I wasn't thinking clearly. I wanted an out and found escape within his book, lying to myself that somehow hours lost within it sufficed to some deep form of research. This reminded me of Jeddah. How I'd get lost for days just walking, pretending, being someone I'll never be. (soft dramatic synth music) (door closing) (traffic humming) [George] This movement on blackmail. Why wasn't it properly logged? [Camden] Because it's not real. It's not your call. If it happened, it's real. Has to be an inside job. Fahda knows it. Wahid, the bodyguard, is a crook. They'd kill him if he wasn't supplying their drugs. The only blackmail that's going on is between Fahda and her bodyguard. They're both just jerking each other's egos. I have a personal favor to ask. What? It has to be off the record. I need to check someone out. A girl I met. Secretly, not just through the VPN. It's personal? Is that okay? How's Julie? I don't like you, Camden. I never have. You're odd. But you got my daughter into Stanford, so you just tell me what you want and I'll let you know when we're even. Okay. I'm exploring getting out. [George] For how long? For good. I'm tired, and because I can. You think I'll have a problem? Probably not. You're a contractor. It's been a long time, though. Yeah. Float it for me, will ya? Okay. Log it or don't. Just, I need to know that it's honorable that it's from the top, from Tom. I understand. Thanks. It's the rundown on everything that I know. (Anna laughing) There's something I want to say. Is that okay? [Anna] Yeah, what? I lied to ya, and it's stupid, so I just wanna get it out there and say it. I'm sorry. Okay. My father was not a locksmith. (Anna laughing) Oh, wow. I'm sorry. And? That's it. That's... Oh. Maybe it's stupid. It's stupid. I'm just trying to do this right. Thank you. ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪ ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪ ♪ Happy birthday, dear Camden ♪ ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪ (employees clapping) (Camden blowing) Please. Oh no, you first. It's for you. How did you know it was my birthday? When we first met, you remember that they carded us on the way back in? Well, I saw it then. So, um, how do you know about lock picks? It's just a hobby. [Anna] Mmm. (paper rustling) (pen scribbling) I'm so sorry. I just, I had a feeling I remembered that I didn't want to forget. It's okay. So, what did you do today? Did you talk to your mom? That's okay. (phone buzzing) This is work. [Anna] It's okay. Fahda? A party? Thank you. Yeah, I'm with somebody. A woman. Would you like to go to a party? Okay. (Mousa speaking in Arabic) Camden and his guest. (loud synth music) Please, have a drink. Two whiskeys, please. (Fahda sniffing) [Fahda] Please. I'm all right. Not the crystal. Half line of K, half line of coke. Very mild. Please, you are my guest. What? Why do you hang out with him? [Camden] Fahda. [Fahda] What happened? We're on spring break, no? Why do you hang out with him? What do you mean? I mean what I say. This man, he's a loser. You're pretty, normal. Women don't want to touch him. I've even bought him girls, and he still makes them go. He's never have a girlfriend, ever. I'm sure that's not true. Except Adrian. Allison, Allie. Yeah, she was crazy, no offense. My cousin was going to law school. Camden met Allie in class. You were going to go run off to New York with her. What happened? You know. Just, just life. Just life. I don't know. It doesn't matter. The feeling wasn't there. Fuck you. You don't get that. Look at you. I think that's noble. I think he's amazing, so fuck you. Fuck me? [Anna] Yeah. This is a good one. This is a good one, Camden. You hold on. You remind me of my mother. This is a very good thing. Good. Now we go on a mission. For revenge! Fahda, no. Oh, no, Camden must go. It's his job. He's my guardian. That was bad. I'm not supposed to say that. I'm sorry. But now we go. Do you, do you want to go or? It's spring break. This is a good one. You, take a picture of us. Come. [Stripper] One, two, three. Camden, do you feel like this is your home? For a time. Not permanent? Where do you want to go? I have an idea. Oh. This is your home, I tell you. Well, no one knows what tomorrow brings. What? Just, anything can happen tomorrow. Anything can be true tomorrow. Right. When I was a child, we would learn English on Friday mornings. This is our weekend, so it sucked. Every year we would get a new teacher, but the same books. And in the beginning of every book, no matter the level, there would always be this chart on the inside cover. 10 words that only exist in English. Cheesy, trade-off, hillbilly. A few others. But the second from the bottom was always, I never forget, serendipity. Serendipity. This is wrong. It's not even an English word. The word is an Arabic word, (ser-end-ib). It's even more an Arabic concept, as well. The development of good events by chance for chosen ones, kings. Every year I would tell my teacher this, to change this. Every year it stayed there in the book. So, what did this teach me? Huh? What? You must always question. Nah, whatever. That the truth is irrelevant. Yes, exactly. It is who is in power that matters. That is tonight's theme. What are we doing? Mousa? Your employer has her heart hurt, so we're going to kill the woman's dog. What? Miniature Siberian Husky. Bitch loves this dog, so we'll kill it. No, let's sleep on this and talk about it in the morning. We can go to the all night spot in Korea town that you like. But we're here. Bring me her head. I'll be back. Hey man, what the fuck? There are certain things I can't do. This isn't Egypt. There are cameras everywhere. Relax, relax, it's just a dog. Mousa, I'm tellin' ya, this is too much for me. You're a little older than he is, no? I mean, this is a good thing for you. He likes you. (car passing) Will you excuse me? Enjoy yourself. He's my bitch. I'm kind to him. Don't worry. You parked on a residential street with your diplomatic plates. No problems then. (car door closing) Sorry, no women here. She's fine. Okay, you're in charge then. Up there, second floor. Dog sleeps on the balcony. I'll be right there. Go. You can wait here. Hey, what is your job? I'm a tutor. No, really, what is your job? I keep them out of trouble. And you're killing dogs? I'll do a better job. It's less work for everyone else, for me tomorrow. Do you wanna do this? It's not my call. No. Listen, motherfucker. This is West Hollywood, California. This guy's not decapitating a fuckin' husky for you or for your fuckin' boss. Cannot leave without the dog head. Hey, you are a fuckin' idiot. Just tell her the dog wasn't outside and you'll come back tomorrow, and then go by yourself a dog corpse or whatever from a fuckin' vet. (Wahid speaking in Arabic) I don't want to hurt anyone. (dog barking) Tell Fahda thank you for a wonderful party. Thank you for the invitation. (dog barking) (soft piano music) Where do you consider home? Nowhere yet. You? My grandfather, he lived on a remote farm in southern Italy. There's no one left there now. Can't sell it because all the properties in the area are vacant. There was a diaspora there after World War II. I went there once when I was 14. Figured I'd always end up there in the end. When I imagine it in my mind, I see a, a river and a lake and a trail. I don't know why I said that. I know you didn't say there was. Have you ever hiked on the Potomac River? No. Are you sure? It's, it's a very long river, all the way to the Chesapeake. Why do you ask? Where I went it was a border river. Virginia on one side, Maryland on the other. Lots of small islands right next to it. Nothing? No, I don't know. How many islands are there? Minnie Island, Wades Island, Chautauqua Island. I don't know, maybe a dozen. No? I went to school there once for a few months. I went to school for a few months once. But not there? There are other campuses. Maybe there aren't. It doesn't matter. If something starts off as one thing and becomes another? I'm going to retire. [Anna] Why? I can. I want to. If I left tomorrow, would you come with me? Shift's up. Still here? Still here. (blinker clicking) [S] Hello. Hi. This is good. This is very good. We've been monitoring your field time, as well. They've welcomed you in, yes? A bit. Well, this is, this is very good news for you, Anna, and I think now we are prepared to offer you some real security, and I know that's what you want, and that's what I want for you. If you don't mind, I'd prefer from this point on being more specific on that. Yes, of course. I couldn't agree more. These things should never be left to assumptions. Well, we see a real opportunity for you here, and we are prepared to offer you in exchange $250,000 in cash, sole ownership of an apartment in Moscow. I don't know the exact value of that, but it's considerable. And an officer's pension, retroactive from your years as an NOC. Thank you. That, uh, it's more generous than I, uh. How long's the job? Well, could be as short as a day or a few weeks. James is drafting the logistics. And what are the risks? Well, there are risks to anything, as you know. There may be very little, but there is concern that you might have to stay out of the country afterwards. For how long? Eh, could be forever. I mean, we don't know at this point. It's simple. It's just a risk. Similar to Daniels. So, James will fill you in on all the specifics. This was a good day for you, Anna. Don't you forget that. You should feel good. Feel good, all right? Past is the past. Come on, eat something. It's supposed to be a celebration. Jesus, all right. Well, I'm glad I ate. You order food and then you start talking and there's questions and everything. The food gets all cold. I hate that. Anyway. Don't open it here. Inside there are three vials and a polyurethane brush. The liquid is latex-based. Use the brush to coat your hands thoroughly before handling the vials. I would do it maybe three, four times. It dries clear, it's matte, very, very hard to see. The others are VX. Do you know what that is? Yeah. All right, you take one of the VX vials. You put one of Camden's hairs inside and then you hide it in his apartment. You hang on to the other vial. Then later on when you're with the princess, preferably when she's partying or something, you coat your hands and then you rub them here underneath the soft, fleshy part of her underarms. You don't just shake hands, because the skin here is too thick, won't work. And the objective is? It's to kill her, yeah. How is this similar to Daniels? Anna, you should know by this point. In the army, an enlisted soldier can never become a commanding officer, and it's not to do with intelligence. It has to do with empathy. An officer can never fully understand the trials that his orders place upon his subordinates, or he wouldn't be able to give them. So we killed Daniels? You know, I think you're feeling very guilty, and I really don't think you have reason to. Right. What if I don't? If I retire now? Don't underestimate the power of a self-fulfilling prophecy. Remember when you first recruited me? Yeah. I miss Beijing. The way it used to be. Pirates. Pirates and thieves. When you get recruited, there's a, there's a brief moment when you ask yourself is this real? Are you the CIA? I mean, you're just saying it. Would it have mattered? I think what matters is that you're, you're in a place like that and you haven't spoken fast, you haven't spoken English really fast to anyone in 10 months and you just feel it in your stomach, you know? And then you meet another American and you're like, wow. You know what eggnog is. And it's stupid, I know, but guaranteed bond. [James] You were a good friend. Who benefits if a Saudi royal dies on our soil? Don't, don't do that, okay? You won't last. Nobody can. And if I refuse, with Camden, the hair? Look, this is your best shot not to live the rest of your life in hiding, all right? You could sell that apartment for $2, maybe $2.5 million. This is your golden parachute, sweetie. Don't you see? And you don't want to fall out of a plane without a parachute. Love is not a real thing. There's survival, and the opposite. Don't be a fool, Anna. You're right. (tense dramatic music) [George] I have a report. It's private for now, but it can't stay that way. It's likely she's on you. [Camden] Counter or domestic? I'm not certain. Has she ever lived in Saudi Arabia? I'm just guessing. Don't know. Could she be Chinese? Perhaps. Or Russian, or corporate. Last month an American engineer named Roger Daniels came into our consulate in Jeddah. He said he'd been part of a CIA cell there for the last 13 years, and that six of the cell members there were put out by Russian operatives. There's no possibility that he ever worked for us, or even for a contractor. There's a lot of people. No. His org understanding was too off, the way he was paid, sanctioned bank. The first one in their cell to go out. Actually, we did it. She was a Moscow HP we were working to flip. Our guy got careless and she flagged him. We fucked up. We believe the other five cell members were killed by their own to prevent defections. We didn't know this when he came in, so we cut him loose. They killed him, too. He was headed here, still believing he was one of us. So he didn't even know who he was working for? No. It's been a long time since we've seen something like this. There was a second woman in the group. We think she still might be alive. And that's Anna? Have to see the reports to know for sure, but he and Anna studied in Beijing at the same university at the same time. They were the only two native English speakers in the program, so there was likely a bond. I'll have to log it either way. I know. Anyway, the Crown Prince has asked for your help. You mean Tom has? No, MBS did. He's having trouble with a journalist. It's personal. There's a family connection. And he thinks you're good with family. Also, the guy has American children. He wants you to broker a negotiation. It's a compliment. If you do this, the agency has no problem with you leaving. That is from Tom. How can I be sure? I just told you it's from Tom. No, I mean the girl. I might love her. For fuck's sake. I don't know. Get caught doing something horrible. She sticks around, then you'll know it's not mutual. You'll know you're just a job. Hey! What if I don't do it? You're just a contractor. (soft dramatic music) [Camden] Hi. [Anna] Hi. (music is turned louder) Is this real? Yeah. [Camden] I'd like you to come with me. When? A week or two. There's a lake. It's more of a pond, but. I'm sure it's great. Will you come with me? (soft synth music) You all right? Yeah. (suspenseful dramatic music) (water running) (Anna exhaling) (suspenseful dramatic music) What are you doing? We can't see each other anymore. It's just, it's not possible. Because this isn't real? No, I'm not attracted to you. Are we the same? It's just not mutual. That's all! (phone buzzing) I'm sorry, I really am. (phone buzzing) (phone buzzing) (phone buzzing) (phone buzzing) Hello? Hour and a half. I'll be there. [Anna] It takes two people to make you. And then it's just you. My life had been mostly a fantasy. I guess some people are just destined to do it alone. (soft dramatic music) [Newswoman] Oil prices have plunged more than 10%, even after OPEC decided to- [Saudi Royal] Thank you for coming so late. Whatever we can do. There is a cousin in my family. His children live in San Diego. He has done very well in business, which has made him very impulsive. And now he considers himself a journalist. Unintentionally, he continues to do my brother great harm. I'd like him to work with us. Understand? I do. Yes, I believe you do. Have you been to the kingdom, Camden? No. Some day. [Saudi Royal] This isn't you? That's me. This woman, I know her. She's friends with this cousin. She lives in Jeddah. She just looks like somebody else. That was just some girl from the club. I'll look into it, but it's nothing to worry about. It's just a common face, I'm sure. It's late. Come here. (traffic humming) (phone ringing) [Phone Recording] At the tone, please record your voice message. When you are finished recording, you may hang up or press pound for more options. (suspenseful dramatic music) (door thudding) (cart rattling) (suspenseful dramatic music) [Camden] Anna? (suspenseful dramatic music) (sound of movement) Anna? (sirens wailing) (suspenseful dramatic music) (loud rock music) (suspenseful dramatic music) (traffic rumbling) (suspenseful dramatic music) (Camden and Cashier speaking in Spanish) (suspenseful dramatic music) It was a job. [Camden] I know. I never had anything to, um, to look forward to aside from my job. But I quit my job. That's what I quit. And I don't want you to remember otherwise. You can still come with me. I can't, though. I wish I could. I need to be here. What are you doing here? Waiting to die. (Camden scoffing) Is that a choice? Yes. A choice that's already been made. I wish we'd met like this. In a bar. And then I would've... I would've known that there's something more. You should leave. If I could go today, now, to the farm, should I? Yes. Go right now. No one knows about it, where it is. I've kept it off the books from the beginning. It's from a different time there. It's outside all of this. We could go together. [Anna] I can't travel. My IDs, they've shut them all off, I'm sure. I know a guy who does that. He owes me a favor. [Anna] Don't. Don't. Don't do this. I made this choice. I'm asking because it's what I want. It doesn't matter what you know or what you didn't know. I didn't. I didn't. It doesn't matter what you knew. It's about what you do, now. (sound of someone entering) A man is going to come over here, and he's gonna ask me to leave with him and I am gonna leave with him. Stand and go now or he'll take you, too. - Come with me. I want you to be with me. I can't force you to, but if it's mutual, you can. (soft dramatic music) (Anna sighing) (alarm sounding) Anna! Stop! Anna! (sirens wailing) Go. (gun firing) (sirens wailing) (footsteps clomping) (subway train whooshing) [Announcer] The red line train for North Hollywood. The Red line train for North Hollywood. (door alarms sounding) (soft dramatic music) [Announcer] Now arriving Civic Center, Grand Park Station. Exit here for LA City Hall, LA County Superior Courts and Hall of Administration, the Music Center, Disney Hall, and the LA Cathedral. (doors opening) (soft dramatic music) You'll be all right. (camera clicking) He'll take off without you, either way. You sure? I'll make sure. [Camden] It'll be wired to you by next week. It's okay. It's better to play this like I don't know anything. (clock ticking) Thanks, George. Look through it. A car will pick us up at 4:00am, drive us to Van Nuys airport. A hired flight will take us to San Francisco. I've used him before. We have to take a commercial flight from SFO to Rome. Do you think we'll be safe in San Francisco? [Anna] Yeah. You sure? No, but we should be. This woman, Allie. You were gonna move to New York with her. I was. But you didn't when you found out she was like me? That they sent her? No. She was a civilian. How do you know? She didn't have that look in her eyes. She'd never been alone. No. (morning traffic humming softly) (Camden sighing) (soft synth music) (coffee maker running) (plane rumbling) (soft piano music) (Newswoman speaking in Italian) (Italian) - Buon pomeriggio. [Grocer] Buon pomeriggio. Um, uova, due dozzine. Torta di marzapane. Ha del burro non salato? Si. - Grazie. - Prego. (gentle piano music) (seagulls squawking)
