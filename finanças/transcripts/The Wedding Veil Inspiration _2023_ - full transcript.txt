Mm, something like that. You don't have to ask the mirror who's the fairest in the land. You live with the international authority on your beauty. Oh-ho... you are smooth. - "Ciao." - Ciao. Buongiorno. Hey, do you remember that gorgeous Venetian mirror we saw when we were on Murano? With the funny shop owner? Oh, yes! "You will have six children." I am willing to compromise with five. No, I'm serious. If I could have figured out how to fit that mirror on an airplane with me, it would be hanging on this wall right now... It was so beautiful. Yes. What is that? What is that smell? - No! - Uh, I don't know. Oh, cappuccinos? Like every morning. No, something else. What is that? Come, find out. Cornettos! I woke up early, so... How early did you wake up? They take hours to make. Early enough... to drive down to Gianni's and buy them. So funny. That's the exact same recipe that I use. There you go. Thank you. Mm. Why did you get up so early? Are you nervous about the opening tonight? I should be, but I'm really not. I feel confident in our product line. Matteo's learning the business quickly. The store looks good. Your wife will be there to help you. My wife will be there to help. I love your confidence. I wish I could borrow some. I think you are very confident about your job. If Nancy retired today, and you were promoted to take her place as Department Chair, which part of her job couldn't you do? Mm... I can do all of it, and if not, I know where to find the answers. See? You are confident, but Nancy gets inside your head, pulls up a chair, and tries to convince you the sky isn't blue. Heh. Okay. I know you don't love Nancy, but she has been a good mentor to me. I don't dislike her. My only problem is the effect she has on you. Well, on us. On us? What do you mean? I mean, us... Our life, children. You've been promised this promotion, but she never seems to actually retire. I just resent someone else having that much control over our lives. Perfect timing! Thank you. Hmm! ♪ Mm-hmm-mm ♪ What is it? From Nonna. For you. Oh! What? Oh! This is gorgeous. What? Oh, let me read the card. Wow. - It's in Italian. - Uh-uh. No, go ahead. You can do it. "Dearest Emma... I... made this... for you to wear to the..." "Inaugurazione." In-aug-ur-a-zione. - Like a party? - Right. Yeah. Tonight. "I wish to be there..." "I wish I could." " Vorrei." "Wish I could be there, but remember... When you wear my lace, you wear my love." - "...My love." - Ohh... Nonna! I miss her. I miss her, too. And you are going to be beautiful in this. Thank you. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Stop! Stop! Stop! You're scratchin' up the walls! Here. You need a fork. - A fork? - Yes. A fork. Like... that. Now let me see the painting. Ah... See? Life hacks. Serious, Matteo... you spend too much time watching videos. And you spend-a too much time a-scratching up our walls, ah! - Caffè? - Sì. Andiamo, dai. And we'll see you next week. Wow. I know, right? This class is a lot. I know it's been a while, but do you remember if your Intro to Art History class was as, uh... Rowdy? No. Well... maybe. We had that one kid who kept getting food delivered to the class. Remember him? - Vividly. In my nightmares. - Oh! Well, you know how it is. They all just want that General Ed credit, so they can get back to their Business and STEM classes. Mm. Yeah, I remember my intro class in Italy. They were bored, too. They were a lot more polite about it, but still... bored. Then I started focusing on art that was actually relevant to them, and they perked right up. Oh, I know that's your plan here, too. Those kids are gonna love Art History by the end of the semester because of you. Oh... we'll see. And don't worry about grading the essays until the weekend. And if you don't have time, I'm happy to do it. Ooh, would you mind doing it? I met this really great guy and we're going to the Upper Peninsula this weekend. We're gonna hike, and take a bunch of pictures, and camp under the stars. Really? No. Of course not. I'm going to be at home all weekend, alone, eating box mac-and-cheese, and scrolling through, trying to find a documentary I haven't seen twice. I will grade the papers. Thank you. - Mm-hmm. - Confession? I love box mac-and-cheese. My Grandma Bea used to slice up hot dogs into it, so that's my favorite way to eat it. Best comfort food ever. Although, the leftovers do not heat up well. I'm sorry, you have leftover mac-and-cheese? I don't even understand what that means. You probably have leftover wine sometimes, too. Whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Let's not get carried away. Can I show you something gorgeous? Absolutely. Paolo's grandmother made this for me to wear to the opening tonight. That is... perfection. Nonna is so good at this. Hey... do you want to come tonight? Yeah! We could hire you to take pictures. And... there's gonna be good food. Food? Catered by Il Pirata. Do not toy with a starving grad student. Free food. Those words... Those words right there... those are the magic words. I will be there after my last seminar. Okay, I'll see you there. I'm gonna head down and start to help them set up. Emma? A moment? I'd like to discuss the article you proposed. Actually, could we... Could we do it later? I'm just headed down to House of Stefano for their opening. Won't take but two minutes. My office, please. Oh. Okay. "Two minutes." "Two minutes..." Emma! - I'm so sorry I'm late. - Finally. I got stuck at work, and Nancy just kept... Oh, no. What happened? I forgot... Nonna's lace! - It's okay. - It's just sitting on the desk at work, I'm sorry... It's okay, it's okay. Come here. I have something to show you. What? The veil? Where did you... Where did you get this? How did this get here? We brought it, of course! It can't be an opening of the House of Stefano without its most famous work. And its biggest fans! Oh! You came! Of course. We wouldn't miss it. Did you bring the baby? No, he's in Boston. Peter says they're gonna order a keg, shoot some pool, and watch the playoffs. That sounds like a great weekend to me! Did you meet Matteo, Paulo's cousin? - We did. - Yeah. He just moved here from Florida. To help with the family business. He has yet to spend a winter in Chicago, though, so we don't know how long he'll stay. Oh, I'll be fine. I've got some socks and a jacket. You're gonna die. Okay, everyone! It's time to mingle. I kid... because I care. - Is she? - She's all right. You have to try these. - Thank you. - Oh, what's in them? No idea. Just eat them. - Mm! - Mm! Right? - Mm-hmm. - Mm-hmm. This caterer is amazing. Remind me to text Nick and thank him for the recommendation. You know, that is Nick's superpower... In any city, he knows the best Italian food. You want a good burger... You're on your own. You want the best tortellini? Ask Nick. Oh, you were right. Matteo is such a good guy. - Isn't he? - Yeah. Paolo's so happy to be working with him. - Mm. - Aw. Hey! You made it! Hi. Uh, wait, is this the veil? This is the veil. Avery, Tracy, this is the Lily. Oh, hi! Oh, Lily, it's so nice to finally meet you. You're not just a disembodied voice in Emma's office. It's really nice to meet the two of you, too. Wait, so I'm... I'm conflicted about the veil. On one hand, I really want to photograph it, but on the other hand, I feel like I should stay far, far away. Aww... Oh! It's all yours. I have heard too many stories about that veil. I'm gonna stand way over here! Stories? What kind of stories? You didn't tell him? Tell me what? The veil has a past. The veil has "a past"? "The veil" has a past. Ooh. Tell me more. Oh, wait. Is this one of those "new guy" initiation things? 'Cause... No, it's a... - well... - Avery. - Yeah. - Let him have it. No, no, no, no, no. You're the professor. Go! Oh... okay. Well, this veil was made in the 1800s by House of Stefano in Burano, Italy. It was made for a bride named Arianna, who would go on to become the "Contessa di Marco". There's even a little "A" embroidered somewhere on there for her. Oh... Ooh. Now, the House of Stefano thought the veil had been destroyed in a fire... but, um, through this complicated... journey of... of forbidden love, and women helping each other in their most vulnerable of times, the veil made its way to San Francisco, where Avery, Tracy, and I bought it... even though none of us was even considering getting married at the time. We just, uh... loved the lace. Anyway, when we bought it, the shopkeeper told us that there is a legend attached to this veil. Anyone who is in possession of this veil... will find true love. Even though none of us really believed it at the time... Well, technically, Avery believed it. Oh, I believed every word of it. True. And then, the next day... and I mean this... The very next day... Avery met Peter, who is now her husband and the father of her son. It's true. It's all true. I mean, he did think I was marrying someone else because I was carrying around a wedding veil, but it was complicated. Long story short, it all worked out, and the rest is our history. And then... when Tracy brought it to New York, she took it to a tailor to have a little tiny snag repaired, and... I just happened... Oh, right. I-I met my husband. And, when I took it to Italy to research its origins, that... is where I met Paolo. This veil is the reason we opened House of Stefano in Chicago. Emma wanted to be here, and I wanted to be wherever she was. Mm. So... that's just part of the story of Arianna's veil... so far. Aw. Look at this. Look at what Peter just bought him. Oh! Little gym shoes! - Oh, they're so cute! - Right? He said he kicked 'em off immediately, along with his socks. He just wants to be barefoot all the time. Because he's a smart kid! I can't believe you forgot this. - I know. - Let me see. This lace is just exquisite. It's even better in person. I feel terrible. It's just sitting on my desk at work. Nancy just... she gets me flustered. You think she's doing it on purpose? No, I think it's just how she is. Maybe she's just afraid of retiring, and-and she's just looking for reasons not to. What? She doesn't wanna retire so she's just giving Emma extra work? So she feels like she's not qualified or ready to be the Department Chair? I don't... yeah, maybe. I'm sure we'll figure it out. I-I have plenty of time. I'm home! - Oh, congratulations. - Yeah! Thank you. Grazie. Are you happy? Seemed like it went so well. Ah, così, così. I'm disappointed that several clients didn't come. Maybe I shouldn't have scheduled it during the playoffs. By the way... Thanks for the veil story. It broke the ice. My pleasure. Mamma mia, what is this? You don't like our food? - No! - It's not that. We're just only here one night. Yeah, and we can't come to Chicago and not have a deep-dish pizza. It's a tradition. Tradition? But that's not even pizza. Yes, that's pizza. A big flying saucer. This is pizza. I agree with you. However, I am just grateful at this point that it doesn't have pineapple on it. Oh, I don't ever wanna see pineapple on my pizza ever again - for my natural-born life. - Excuse me. Pronto. That's all just for show, because every time I have leftovers, it somehow magically disappears out of my fridge. Ooh, maybe you have a little house elf. Ooh-hoo. I hope I have a little house elf. If I do, can he do some cleaning and some laundry, if he's gonna eat all my... Hey, are you okay? That was my sister, Sophia. They're taking Dad to the hospital. - Excuse me. - Yeah. What do you want to go? What do you want me to do? Tomorrow... I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. Okay, I booked you a flight out of O'Hare. Leaves in three hours. Window seat. Are you sure you don't want me to go with you? Thank you for offering, but let me see what's going on first. But if you could check on Matteo? Yeah, I can do that. He's going to drive me to the airport, so I can run through some last-minute things about the store. You just take a breath. Could be nothing, right? Right. Yes. I think he'll be better by the time you get off the plane. Okay. Thank you both. I'm glad that you are here with Emma. Of course. Yeah, we'll keep your dad in our prayers. Thank you. - Okay. - Bye. Bye. Call you soon. Okay. Ti amo. I thought I heard you up. - Hi. - Any news? Well, I'm tracking his flight. He is... somewhere over the Atlantic right now. Are you two having fun without me? You know how I struggle with F.O.M.O. What's going on? Sophia added me to the group chat, but nothing so far. This is one of those "no news is good news" - scenarios, isn't it? - Absolutely. Yeah, definitely. Anyway, since I was awake, I figured I would do some work. So what's going on? Reading an article about the veil, actually. I was late to the party because Nancy told me she wants me to publish just one more time before she hands over the reins. I know. I know, and if it's not this, it'll be something else, and then it'll be something else, and then it'll be something else, but... the story of the veil's so interesting, I figured I should record its history. Yeah. Do you want me to leave it when I go tomorrow? I mean, I feel like it's time to... you know, for someone else to have it for a while. Yeah, I'm happy to keep it at the store with the christening gown. I don't think Matteo will mind. So, what's the story with Matteo anyway? Why did he leave Miami? Oh... a tale as old as time... Broken heart. - Aw. - Oh. Yeah, he had this relationship and it went on far too long, and then he just kept trying, kept trying, and then she moved away, and then they tried to do the long-distance thing. Oh, I know how that situation goes. Exactly. So, Paolo went down there for business, they reconnected, and Matteo was ready for a career change, and Paolo's delighted. You know how he is about family. - Aw. - Yeah. Of course. Wait a second. Is that your five-year plan? Yes. Yes, it is. Of course. I still keep it. I just revise it every five years. Do you know what I think is the funniest thing about your five-year plan? Uh, are you going to say "everything"? Yes, actually, you're right... It's everything. But, really, the funniest thing is... that the best thing that ever happened to you... Meeting and falling in love with Paolo... Isn't even on your list! Yes, it is. Oh, yeah. He added it and didn't tell me. - Let me read it to you. - What? Wait, I love this! I found it, yeah. Here we go. Ahem. "Meet a dashing and exotic Italian... " Oh! "Who sweeps me off my feet and makes me forget other men even exist." Can you even? I mean... I just... What? Just this! It just makes me so happy. It reminds me of the good old days, you know? We were in college, and we were just sitting around, in our jammies. Except remember, we would make those brownies in a mug? - Oh... - Oh, yes. Oh, the best. Here, give me my phone. Mm. Selfie! - Oh. - Come in tight. Okay. Everyone say "brownies". Okay. Of course. One, two, three... Brownies! Oh, I love that. Send that one to us. Aw. I think I might actually have some brownie mix in my pantry right now. Good morning. Any news yet? They did a procedure... and now he's resting. We'll know more soon. I'm so sorry. I really wish I could be there with you. Me too. So... how are you? Good. Tracy and Avery just left for O'Hare this morning. I'm gonna go down to the shop this afternoon, check on Matteo. Thanks. And right now, in your honor, I am doing absolutely nothing other than enjoying my coffee. I'm proud of you. I-I... I agree. Yeah, I feel... I feel the same. Thank you. Next time. Nancy sits in these meetings all day, every day. I don't know how she does it. 15 minutes in, I feel my soul start to leave my body. Thank you for coming last night. Of course. It was actually a lot of fun, and now I can cross "Attend the grand opening of a lace store" off my bucket list. Actually, the lace is kinda cool, isn't it? It really was. I mean, it was a good... What are you... what are you doing? Oh, you just got a little Charlotte over here. She's a beauty. A "Charlotte"? - Yeah, a spider. - A spider? Okay. Uh, how... how big is it? - She's substantial. - Substantial! Oh! Uh... uh... What are you... What are you... What are you doing with it... Her? Just taking a little video. Whoa! She's not dangerous. You know, spiders... they're just not really my favorite. Okay, do you want me to relocate her to some place that's a little more... not your office? Mm-hmm. That's exactly... Okay, yeah, got it. What I'd like. That would be wonderful, and I think right now would be a great time to take a quick, spontaneous visit over to the lace shop to see how Matteo's doing. - Do you want some company? - So, I'm just... That would be wonderful, yes! Once you get the spider just out of the office... Where did you... What? What's going on? Um... Charlotte has gone rogue. Rogue? Yeah, I don't know where she is. And I'm out! Oh, come on! She's just a little spider! She's more afraid of you than you are of... ah, well, I guess that last part's not actually true. I think that's a... Here, let me. Thank you. Oh. Hey. - Hi. - Yup. So, I... I told them not to touch the veil. Is that the right call? Oh, 100% the right call, but... - Okay. - Who are they? I don't know. It's just been a constant stream of people all day. Everybody wants to see the veil. Do you think we should move it somewhere more secure? No, I don't think so. They've been really respectful. I am so confused. How do they know about the veil? Uh, somebody mentioned something about a video online. I was gonna check it out later tonight. Video? What vid... Lily? Hmm? What video? It's her. It's "Everyone's Favorite Art Historian"! Everyone's Favorite... what? Wh... Anyone who is in possession of this veil will find true love. Don't be mad. I'm not mad, but... "Everyone's Favorite Art Historian"? That's just what they do on there. There's, like, "Everyone's Favorite Wafflemaker", and "Everyone's Favorite Appliance Repair Woman". Oh, I follow her! Did you see that one about, um, the dishwa... - The dishwasher pods? - pods? Yes, yes! - I did. I had no idea. - I know, me either! What is "on there"? What is this on? Where is this? Oh, it's called "Clack". It's an app where people upload their videos. So, it's a new social media platform? Brand-new, but the videos are supposed to be more, um... what's the word I'm looking for? Uh, socially redeemable? "Socially redeemable." There's lots of knowledge sharing and beauty. Travel tips. Goofy pet videos. Goofy pet videos! Okay, I'm not mad, but I'm not comfortable either. You really should've asked me first, Lily. I know. I'm sorry. But if it helps at all, it is not on the same channel as my other videos. You know, the, uh... the "Charlotte" ones. Who's Charlotte? Uh... can we take it down? Sort of. You have 100,000 views. 100,000 views? Uh-huh. And it's been shared. A lot! So even if we take it down, it is... everywhere. Emma, this is just my humble opinion, but I think you should leave the video up. I mean, the opening numbers were not that great, and this video is bringing people in. They may not be buying anything, but it's bringing them into the store. That gives me an idea. Everything you have on the floor right now is wedding and expensive items, to attract the large vendors and other high-end customers, right? Right, yup. It's our traditional business model. I almost sound like I know what I'm talking about, huh? I bought it. Did you see that box at the warehouse with the lace barrettes and the fans... the small pocket squares from Italy? Yeah. Okay, what if we set up a display with just those small items? Because that's the type of thing that the walk-in traffic might actually buy. A little piece of the House of Stefano? That's actually a really good idea! Yeah, I like it. Great. Well, then, regarding the video... I don't love it, but if it has the potential to help Paolo, I am okay with you leaving it up. All right. I'm going to head home... and I'll see you tomorrow. - Okay. - 'Kay. Oh, hey, what was the thing with the dishwasher pods? Oh, you don't put 'em in the detergent thingy. It gunks it all up. Yeah, you just put it in the utensil caddy. That's a good tip. Hmm. Call me if you need anything. And I am nobody's favorite art historian. Well, she's my favorite art historian. Yeah, mine too. All right. Hey, do you know anything about setting up a small display? I do, actually. - Really? - Mm-hmm. - Follow me. - Okay. Hi! So, what's the latest? Well, they inserted some stents, and he has to take it easy for a while, but he's going to be fine. Okay, I'm so relieved. Me too. Look, I'm going to stay a few more days to help Uncle Vittorio, okay? Yeah, of course. So, what's going on there? Well, I can never, ever, ever go back in my office because a massive, mutant spider lives there now. So, there's that. Just burn it down! Yes, that's exactly my plan. Oh, and I went into the shop today, and you are never going to guess what Lily did. And he's dating a model... because, of course, he is. Awesome. Whoa! Why? Why, why, why? Why are you doing that? No, no, no! Stop it! Stop! Stop! Why are you doing that? Oh! Thank you. For sure. Oh, just... Oh, pardon me, excuse me. Emma? Oh, good morning. Perfect timing. Listen, I would like you to start coming to staffing meetings with me. They can be heated at times, but I'd rather we both go together for a while, and then I can transition them to you. Of course, yes. When are they? Tuesdays, two to four. I'm so sorry. I can't do that. I have a conflict. That's when my intro class is. Oh, no, I gave Jason Moore your intro class for the rest of the semester. Uh... It's just that Jason teaches right out of the book, and I promised these kids that they would... No, it's a GE class for most of them. They'll be fine. I only have two classes this semester. Yes, and once you're Department Chair, you won't have any. Oh, by the way... They called an impromptu budget meeting for tonight. They're bringing dinner in. Can you stay? Could I dial in? I'm supposed to... I would rather you be there. I need people to see you more so that they start coming to you instead of me. Okay, yeah. Uh, I can do that. Good talk. Thank you for restocking that. I can't believe how many of them you've sold already. So many! Did you order more? Yeah, a bunch this morning. Great. Oh, there's Emma. Hey. It's so busy. Right? It's great. How's the new display doing? Great. Thank you for the idea. I'm so glad. - Lily... - Mm-hmm? The veil doesn't really work like that. I think you're safe. Ha. Respectfully, you do not know that. I am very susceptible to things. - Okay. - Excuse me? - Hi. - Hi, again. You talked about the veil before, but what is this gown here? This is actually my husband's christening gown, along with several generations of Di Stefano babies... but really, it's so much more than that. This little gown offered us an important clue in understanding Arianna's story. If Arianna never had a child, why would she keep a Christening gown in her trunk with her dearest possessions? This is going on Click again, isn't it? "Clack," and yes, it is. - Lily... - Keep talking, keep talking. Keep talking. Let me show you this little detail over here... You're home! Amore! What? Hi. I missed this face. What happened? Why are you here? Uncle Vittorio has everything in hand, so I just jumped on a plane, but I can only stay a few days. That's okay. You're here now. I swear, the machine was broken! You just don't have the touch. Thank you. So, how is Papa? Mm, happy to be home, but he's taking all of this a little personally. I guess finding out you're not Superman anymore can be humbling. Mm. You know what? I stopped by the glass store. Your mirror is still there, and the shop owner asked me how many children we have now. No, he didn't! He did! And he's holding that mirror for you because you loved it so much. It's meant to be. Oh... okay. Well, maybe we can sell the house, and use the money to cover the cost of shipping it here. That's impressive financial planning. Piccolino. I'm so glad that Paolo is back. Matteo has a stack of questions saved up. So, are you and Matteo becoming friends? Friends? Sure. What you are thinking... no. I didn't say a word. Yeah, but you thought it, and I can read your mind. It's just that you guys were standing right by the veil. Ah! Ba-ba-ba... no! Don't... Don't... Don't do that, please. Okay, okay. Let me just ask you one question, and then you can tell me to back off. Is Matteo your type? Oh... is the handsome, hardworking, funny guy with the model girlfriend my "type", is that really... She's not his girlfriend anymore. Okay, Emma... ha. I make videos of cool bugs. I change my own oil. I climb on rocks. I'm collecting clips of "cool moss" patterns. Wow. Yeah. I walk in this park every day just to feel the grass, and I like myself just fine, but I also know that men don't always... Well, let's just say I'm not usually attractive to the type of men who likes women who ask them... what shade of cotton-candy pink nail polish goes best with their Gucci bag. I think you might be making some assumptions about Matteo. And I think you might be making some assumptions about my dating life. It hasn't been painless. I'm sorry. I just think you're amazing. And any guy would be lucky to date you. Okay, thank you. You're very kind... heh... And because you are so kind, now is probably a good time to tell you that I read your article on the veil and I didn't like it. Wha...? Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! - What? - Huh? What? Uh, I read your article on the veil and I did not like it. No, no, no, I heard you, but what's... what's wrong with it? Um... it's fine. You know, it's... it's full of facts, so that's... good. "Fine," factual, and "good"? - Uh-huh. - Wow. Well, you know, um, the history of the veil is more than just names and dates. It's more than just a list of facts. Yeah. Have you read the comments on your videos? No. There is no joy to be found in Internet comment sections. Okay, normally, that is very true, but just this once, I think you should. Look, I know about "publish or perish," and I know that you really want this Chair position, but Emma, when you are out there doing your own thing, bringing your passion... that is how you engage people in the history of art. Yeah, but that's not how the university works. I know, and for the record, I do not like TA'ing for Professor Moore... Your intro class is miserable now. Great. Okay, well... aside from that one really bad typo on the first page, your article's fine. What? What really bad typo? You misspelled "veil". Good meeting, everyone. Thank you. Ahem. How's the article coming? Oh! Uh... well, I'm just in the middle of an edit, so I'll have a first draft over to you soon. Do you have time to, um, go over the curriculum for next... No, not right now. Um, some of the students told me about a video of you... so I asked them to show me. You were in the lace store talking about the history of a wedding veil. That's right. I'd like you to stop making these kinds of videos. Any videos, really. It's not against university policy. No, I just don't like them. It's simply not what we do in this department. If you have something else to say, write another article. And she doesn't own you. The university can't tell you what to do. Actually, they can. I mean, in certain circumstances, but not this. They... They love videos, documentaries, that sort of thing. This is... This is Nancy's reluctance to change. Emma, I have something important to ask you. Okay, I'll marry you. Again. Sorry. What... What... What's up? You know Nancy's never going to retire, right? She's going to pass away sitting at her desk when she's 110 years old. No. This is her final semester. I even had to give up my intro class because she passed another meeting to me, so, it's... it's happening. But do you love it? I did not love giving up my intro class. No, but... I mean all of it. You don't seem to love it anymore. What if you walked away? Went somewhere else? Why would I do that? I've worked so long to get here, and now I'm almost there, so why would I go somewhere else? Where would I go? I... Italy. Emma, I... I'm sure Natalia would love to have you back at the university, and you loved teaching in Italy. Or no? Paolo... what is this really about? Emma... Papa's heart problem was a wake-up call for Uncle Vittorio. He asked to work part-time in a position that allows him to travel. That's wonderful. I think that's wonderful, but... Emma... give me your hand. Papa needs to retire. And if Papa retires, and Uncle Vittorio semi-retires... someone has to run the business, and that's me, and I cannot do that from Chicago. I have to move back to Italy and take over the family business, or... we will have to sell it all. But there has to be someone else. What about Sophia? She's already picking up Uncle Vittorio's marketing responsibilities. There's no one else. It's only me. Well, that's a much bigger suitcase than last time. Two weeks. Three at the most. I will talk to them, I promise. Maybe I can split my time. It's just that I did long-distance once before, and it did not go well for me. I know. But he was the wrong man. We will figure this out. Okay? Okay. Yes? I have to go. I know. Ciao. So, did you guys talk about moving back to Italy again? Not really. I... I assumed we would, but years in the future, after we've raised the children we don't even have yet. I don't know. I don't really know how to solve this. You'll figure it out. You know you are "Everyone's Favorite Art Historian." Okay, so you saw the videos? Of course! We love them. You are just a natural teacher. And I know you think being Department Chair is the right path, but... Speaking of... Nancy's on the other line. Okay, call us back tonight. Okay. Love you. Love you. Good morning, Nancy. Um... Hi! Welcome to the House of Stefano. How can I help you? Wow, that's a beautiful piece that you've chosen. Bye! - Whew! - Whoo. That was over the top. Thank you. Of course. You know, I came here just to see if I forgot my sunglasses here. That was four hours ago. Yeah, but you were busy, and that wasn't just the small stuff. I sold two shawls and a tablecloth! Yes, you did. How do you know how to do that? Do what? Just jump in with customers when you don't know anything about lace? My parents have a hardware store. One of those local shops that has literally everything, if you know where to look. I love places like that. Yeah. So, what, you were like the free labor? Yeah! All of us were. I'm the youngest of four. You get really good at working with the public really young, so, I guess customer service is just customer service, whether it's lace or hex nuts. I know. What do you got? These, and these. Okay! So, these are mine... - Okay. - But, fun fact... I like these better. - Really? - Yes. Well, I'll tell you what. Mm-hmm? You come back in a month, if nobody else has claimed them, these bad boys are yours. Oh, ho! Okay. That works for me. Thank you. Great. Oh, here, let me. Ahem. Okay. There you go. Oh, your... here. Okay. Bye. Lily? Yeah, hi. Oh! Hi. Look, I know you're joking with the whole trying-to-avoid-the-veil thing, but be honest. Do you think there's any... Do I think it's really a magical talisman? Yeah, something like that. Well... Matteo, I think that life is cruel... and difficult... Yeah. But I also think there's beauty... and love and magic all around us, if we just take a second to see it. This veil was just sitting in a shop before Emma and her friends saw it, and because they saw it, the grace of it flows through their lives. So... you can call that magic, or... enchantment, or mysticism, or... the power of suggestion, or even a freakishly coincidental string of good luck, but... I prefer to think of it as the universe righting itself... when you least expect it to. And that's probably way more than you wanted to hear. Um, so, why don't you unlock the door, and let me out of this lace palace? Sure. Absolutely. What, are you not leaving, too? No, I, uh, I-I've been packing up the veil at night and taking it home for safe-keeping, just 'cause some of the folks have been getting... Overly enthusiastic? Yeah. Well, that's... smart. Okay. Well, good night. Lily...? Yeah, hi. There's this restaurant that just opened up down the street, and they claim to have better Cubanos than they have in Miami. Mm, that sounds like a suspicious claim. - Right? - Yeah. So, I was gonna go this week and see if they could back it up, and I'm wondering if, um... you'd like to come with me? Okay. Sure. Okay! Okay. Cool. Well, have a good night. Goodnight. Bye. Goodnight. Hi. I know, it's been two days. I'm sorry. And it has been three days. Are you okay? What's wrong? Nothing's wrong. I'm just really busy. Not buying it. I sent you three pictures of Daniel. I've sent you two articles I thought you would find interesting. And a link to a pair of shoes I love. And a hilarious penguin video! Well, all penguin videos are hilarious. You always respond, even when you're busy. You always find time to send at least a heart or something. Yeah, you're doing that thing where you get vague when you're feeling overwhelmed. What? I don't get vague. No, you do, actually. Where's Paolo? Is he back yet? No, he is still in Italy for at least one or two more weeks. How are you handling that? Uh... Someone's at the door. I'll call you later? Do you promise this time? Yeah, yeah, I will. I promise. Hi. Emma di Stefano? Yeah? This is for you. I didn't order a pizza. Well, congratulations. You just got a free pizza! Thanks. What are you doing? Oh, God. Is this still about that little spider? It's not little. "Substantial". The word you used was "substantial". She's long gone. Hey! Speaking of cool bugs... That's not a thing. Come on now. Charlotte's cool. Be nice. You will not believe what I saw in the park this morning... A giant swarm of ladybugs. Oh. Do you know what they call a herd of ladybugs? It's probably not a "herd". - Oh. - No. They call it a "loveliness". - Really? - Can you believe that? - A "loveliness"? - "A loveliness of ladybugs." - Oh. - I know. You know, sometimes, the people who are in charge of naming things really get it right. Hmm. So, I did something last night that I did not think I was going to do. I read all of the comments on the two videos you posted about me. They're nice, aren't they? Most of them were quite lovely. So...? So, what video are we doing next? We are not. Why not? Emma, this could be a whole thing. Mini-stories. You have so many views already, and you weren't even trying. Well, I've been asked not to continue them. By who? By Nancy? Mm. Since when does Nancy get a vote in your personal life? It doesn't really matter. My brief stint as Everyone's Favorite Art Historian is officially over, and... Is that... What is in that? Is that Charlotte in that cup? Yes. - She was on my desk? - Mm-hmm. I thought you said she was long gone. I lied. Do you wanna know the exact moment I decided I wanted to T.A. for you? No, I... I'm gonna tell you. It was freshman year. You were talking about the difference between museum art and the type of art that you walk past every day, and you don't even notice, how art and history are so interconnected. You don't need to walk through some museum to experience them. That's when I realized how accessible art could be, if you just knew where to look. It was inspiring. You were inspiring. But I guess it's time for your budget meeting. Let's go, Charlotte. And then there's the Art History major? And then there... yep. Yes, they're all very, very jealous of my success, but you know how families are. I'm the youngest, and I'm the only girl, and... the weird one. Yeah, but we all... We get along pretty well. So, what's the verdict? Oh, on the Cubano? - Mm-hmm. - No. - No? - No, I don't think... I'm sorry. I mean, it's nice being this far from home, it's like a little taste of Miami, so... - Oh. - Yeah, what'd you think? Um, well, this is my first Cubano, so it's the best one I've ever had. - Come on! - Yeah. Have you never been to Miami? I have never been to Florida. You serious? Oh, wow, I gotta take you sometime. We'll go to Little Havana and we'll have some real food, and then I'll take you to the beach, of course... Ahem. And then, um, my friend just got this boat... Uh, talk to me about you and Paolo. How did you decide to come up here and start working for him? Um... not much to tell, really. He just... he needed help, so. Okay. Seriously? Emma. - Oh, good morning. - Good morning. I was wondering if you would wait for me? There's something I'd like to discuss with you. Of course. Can I have a black coffee, please? So, it's basically 20 minutes at 350, and then you glaze them once they cool. Well, that sounds delicious. Mm! Oh, the grandkids love them. Mm-hmm. Nancy... I feel like you might be avoiding something. Well, I am. Um... it's a difficult issue to address, especially with another woman. Emma, I've always enjoyed your style. My style? Yes, your taste in clothing... The bright colors. Oh. You always look like Andy Warhol and Georgia O'Keeffe are going to a Holi festival together, but you have to know, it's just not an appropriate look for a Department Chair. Now, before you argue with me, I... I don't care about other departments. I care about our department and the image we present, and if we're going to be taken seriously... Art History has an uphill battle already. Let's not make it harder than it has to be. Mm. Mm, good talk! Mm-hmm. Enjoy your day. Okay, yep. I will send the contracts over to him this morning. Bravo. Good. Listen, I need a favor. Really? Okay. I cannot believe you have recruited me to your life of crime. This is breaking and entering. There's no "breaking". Paolo told me where the key was and what the code is. It's just "entering". Who even keeps a key under a flowerpot? Paolo? Come on. How much time do we have? Um, 20 minutes until her class ends, five minutes in her office, 10 minutes for her to walk home, if nobody catches her. So, our window is 35 minutes. Okay. You start in here, and I'll set up out back. Okay, backyard is done. This looks amazing. - Let's get out of here. - Yeah, okay. - Wait-wait-wait! - What? Music. Go, go, go! All clear. Go, go, go. Just walk normal! Be yourself! I don't know what means. Those are two different things! Whoa! - Oh! - Shh, shh, shh! - Okay. - Okay. Okay. Hello? All right. So, what's next on our, uh, crime spree? Oh, there's a wing place nearby. You're talking about Lord of the Wings? - Yes! - Where you have to sign the waiver if you order them spicy? Yes. That's the one, yeah. You wanna go do some damage, mainly to ourselves? Um... you know what? I... Sorry. I have to go. Um, but have fun, and remember that... cold milk helps with the heat. Heh! Are... Are you sure? Scusi, signorina? Paolo! Is this seat taken? Oh, this seat? Um... well, I don't see any other tables around, so, yes, you could sit here. Although... you look familiar to me. Were you following me? No, but I get that a lot. I see. You were fortunate to get this table, right by the water. That's not easy in Venice. Yes, it's very beautiful. May I... pour for you? No, thank you. I think I could do it. And to what are we toasting? All'amore. To love! To love. And tell me, sir, are you in love? Sì. Very much so. Well, she is a very lucky lady. No, I am lucky... and she has exquisite taste, except for one questionable position on pizza. - Hi, there. - Hey. So... I had a lovely date with my husband last night. He informed me he had a local operative, so just wanted to come by and say thank you. Well, I don't know what you're talking about, but you're welcome. I know you miss him, but he's gonna be home soon. Hey, Emma? Can I ask you a question... about Lily? Sure. Okay. So... I like her. And we've been out a few times, done a little light breaking-and-entering... Oh, did you? Mm, just a little bit, but like, we're out, we're having fun, we're talking, we're connecting, and then all of a sudden, she throws up these walls. Yeah. And I know she mentioned "Charlotte" the other day. Is Charlotte, uh, a girlfriend? Or an ex-girlfriend, or somebody that... No, Charlotte's her code word for spiders. For spiders? Mm-hmm. I really adore Lily, and nothing would make me happier than to see the two of you together, but I really think you just need to talk to her. I-I will tell you, though, that she often goes to Grove Rock Park in the mornings. - Okay, thank you. - For what it's worth. Hey, quick question. Are people still coming by just to see the veil? Oh, yeah. They love it. Everybody wants to buy it, or rent it. Hi. Ciao, amore. Did you have dinner? Not yet. Um... I wanna ask you something, and I want you to tell me the truth. Of course. How is the store doing? It's early, but breaking into the U.S. market has been hard, but honestly, our numbers look good, 'cause of the small walk-in sales. Okay, so I wanna run something past you. It's a really bad idea, and I need you to tell me that. It's a really bad idea. No! You have to listen first, then you can tell me. Okay. So, I have been looking at all the pictures Lily took of people checking out the veil on opening night. People like this come into the store every day. Sì. We know the House of Stefano created Arianna's veil originally. So, you guys own all the rights to the design. What if... you began creating replicas of Arianna's veil? Hmm. It's a classically beautiful design. That's why Avery initially noticed it. So, I think people will want it, even if they don't know the history. Okay, continue. And for those that do think the veil is special, even though they'll know they're buying a replica and it doesn't have the same legend attached, I think maybe they'll still want it, too, even if they're not planning on getting married any time soon. Who would buy a veil if they're not getting married? Well... Of course. Never mind. And I thought we could even customize it with their initial, just like the original, and you could call it "The Arianna". The Arianna... I think it's brilliant. Let me ask Sophia about it from a marketing perspective. What-what was that word you just said? Br... It started with a "B"? Which one? "Brilliant," was it? I think that was... I think that was it. I don't remember. No, no, no, I think you do remember. Hey! I went over the essays for your seminar class, and I wasn't sure about a few of them, so when you get a minute, can you make sure you agree with my notes? - Of course. - Thank you. Are you okay? Did someone die? No. Why? Because you look sad and you're dressed for a funeral. No, I am dressed for the job I want. You want to be a defense attorney? Ah... very funny. Can I talk to you about the videos? I have to take them down? It's okay. I understand. I am surprised that you got away with it for as long as you did. No, no, no, no. Leave them up. It's okay. Okay. I wanted to ask you... do you really believe these videos are a way to get people interested in everyday art? I do, and I was thinking, do you remember that one class where you talked about the World's Fair in Chicago in... whenever it is? - 1893. - 1893! And they built the White City for the exhibits, but they didn't design the buildings to last? Right, but if you know where to look, there're still pieces of it all around Chicago. Exactly! That is everyday art. We could make more videos. We could make more videos... but you cannot be dressed like "Everyone's Favorite Funeral Director". Okay. I really like this idea... Mm-hmm. But I know Nancy doesn't. So, my question to you is... If I decide to make more videos... Mm-hmm? - Are you in? - I'm in. You can think about it. I'm in! Don't have to decide right away. I'm in! I am in! Just let it marinate. I took three seconds, and it turns out I'm in. Hi. I was just about to head home. I won't keep you. I just talked to Sophia about your idea. We'll do a trial run and see. So... what are your plans for tonight? Well, I was gonna do one of my online-chat dinners with Tracy and Avery. I haven't really talked to them for over a week. Eh! Mamma mia... A whole week? That's a long time for us. And speaking of long times... when are you coming home? Not much longer. That's... I gotta go. Emma? Pronto. Finally! We're starved. You forget our tummies are on East Coast time. What are you doing here? Well, you did start to do that vague thing again... So, we flew in for the night. We felt like maybe you needed us. Oh! I really do. Did someone die? Um, I don't think so. And then, I kinda hung up on him. It was not my finest moment. All right, well, let me help you with that. I can only imagine how hard this is, but you guys are so, so good together. I mean, there has to be a way forward. I know. This is gonna sound crazy, because I'm the woman who will never leave New York, and probably, also, it's pretty hypocritical of me, but, um, why stay in Chicago? I mean, your family... Your parents moved to Florida. You love Italy, you love Paolo's whole family. If you were there, you would have a million babysitters all lined up. Oh, I can co-sign to the importance of that last point. Wildly important. So, what's keeping you in Chicago? My job. I've worked so hard to get where I'm at and... it just feels like Paolo's choosing his job over me. Oh. That's kind of what I'm doing, huh? I'm choosing my job over Paolo. A little. Can I ask you a question? After you got married, did you change anything on your five-year plan? No, not really. Okay, so that's kind of the point. He has his goals, and you have yours, but what is it that you guys want as a couple? You know we love you, and we are in awe of your determination. It's very impressive, but you are making decisions for two people now, you know? And it's okay to not want something because you have something, or someone, that you want more. I really hate meetings. Oh! We know. We know. And then Nancy gave... when she gave away my intro class, I wanted to cry. And my videos... They're so good! Right? That's what I think. That is the most Emma thing I've ever seen you do, truly. Ever. I just can't... I can't... How am I supposed to just tell Nancy, "Oh, just kidding," after everything she did to prepare me for this job. Emma? You can. You can tell her "no". I'm back! Ah! I'm so sorry about the take-out coffee. My machine is possessed. Nonna's lace is so beautiful. - Ohh. Isn't it? - Yes. I just keep forgetting to wear it. - Thank you. - Look at this. There's a little embroidered "E" for "Emma". What? I never saw that! She's the sweetest. - She really is. - Thank you. - You're welcome. - So pretty. Oh, no, you guys. The car is here. Oh, no! Already? Yes. I thought it was, like, 15 minutes out, but it's here. I can't believe you only came out for one night. - I love you. - Always. You needed us, so we came. Yeah, it's what we do. - I love you. - I love you. Okay, well, we have to go. - My rating... - Okay. Can we take some of those for the road? Oh, take them all. - Avery. - Love you. Okay, no spilling in the car, though. Okay? Hi. Oh! Um... uh... whoa. Ha-ha! Hi. I, um... meant to do... all of that. I wish I had, like, a judge's card to hold up. I'd give ya a 9.8. Not a perfect 10? No! You'd need to break your camera or a key limb for a perfect 10. Um, so... listen. Yeah, okay. I dated a woman in Miami, but it didn't work out. Actually, I guess that's not fair. It ended well for her, because she's engaged to him now. Oh! Ouch. I'm sorry. And I made a vow, on the spot, to never get serious again. And for a year, I didn't, but now... I'm sitting in this park, and I'm thinking about breaking my vow... but I just have one problem. Just one? Just one. See, there's this woman, and she's different in all the right ways. She checks all the boxes. But she runs kinda hot and cold. We're having fun, we're getting close, and then she's running the 100-yard dash to get away from me. Yeah, that's a protection thing. She has... I... have dated men in the past and it's always ended up with some sort of disconnect... I guess, between who I am... and who they want me to be. Well, maybe you just dated the wrong men? They seem like the right men at first, you know? And they... they don't come with a warning label, so, by the time you figure it out... um... I know. I know what you mean. It's like, um... if you just try harder, then you can love enough for both of you. Yeah, that's exactly how it feels. So... here's the deal. Ooh... We can give up. Or... we can take a chance. Just for today. We can worry about tomorrow later. So... I just want to be clear on this. We're dating just for today? Yeah. Just for today. Okay, I'm in. Okay. I will date you just for today. - Great. - Mm-hmm. Did their visit help? Well, it gave me some clarity, but... Look, in the end, I'm not sure it matters. I've committed to this, and Nancy has spent a lot of time mentoring me, and now she's finally ready to retire. I can't just back out now. Emma. The best we can arrange is three weeks here in Italy, and one in Chicago. I know, it's not ideal, but for now, it's a solution. No, that's not a solution. Look, I know how this goes. That works for two months, and then you're postponing just by a week or two, and then a couple months later, you miss it entirely, and then you're not picking up when I call you, and then... Amore. I told you, when we were in Italy, I can't do long distance. I don't want to do that again. This isn't just a business decision for me. Papa's illness showed me that I live too far from my family. I thought I was your family now. Let's talk about this later. We've got a problem. Oh. Uh... yeah, what's wrong? I just got the final budget for next semester, and there's no getting around it. You're gonna have to let someone go. Even if you retire? Even when I retire, yes. We're still one person over. Now, I recommend that you let Carissa go. She's our least-experienced professor, and she cancels more classes than anybody. But that's because she has two-year-old twins. Mm-hmm. Well, it's your decision. I'll need it by tomorrow. Nancy? I... made my decision. Oh, that was fast. I want to fire myself. I'm so sorry. I know you've done so much, but I don't want to do this job. It's... It's... It's not me, and... Finally. Just... Finally! Finally. I've been waiting for you to realize this. - You knew? - Mm, yeah. Emma... you have so many talents. Putting up with bureaucracy? Not one of 'em. Oh! Well... why didn't you say anything? You know, I've never had any success telling someone that their dream is not the right fit for them. You needed to figure it out for yourself. I'm glad you finally did, 'cause... I was running out of ways to annoy you. Goodnight. Ohh! Are you leaving me? Paolo. What are you doing here? I flew home to work all this out. Where are you going? To Italy, to come find you. I am never leaving you. Oh, I love you so much. I talked to my family, and we thought that... - Mm. - Why are you shaking your head? I'm not even done talking. Because all you have ever wanted to do is run your family business, live in Italy with your family, have a bunch of kids running around, some local wine, maybe get your own boat, and explore the coast. That is true, yes, but I don't want to do any of it without you. And I don't want to be the reason you don't do any of it. Let me show you something. What is it? Your five-year plan. Watch this. No more five-year plan. Except for this part. Of course... Of course. And... I'm pretty sure I quit my job today. Emma! And I plan to do it officially in the morning. Why? I'm done letting other people make our decisions for us. Good to know. Anything else? Mm. Yes. Do you remember those videos about the veil? Mm-hmm. Lily and I plan to expand those into a series. Art and history are all around us, and I think we should be talking about them. Of course, because you are... Oh, you're gonna say it? "Everyone's Favorite Art Historian". Oh, you really... Oh, wow. You too? Are you done? Or there are more surprises? No, I'm done. Oh, wait! Ah! Matteo is in love with Lily. - Wait! What? - Yes! We left the veil in the shop! What did you think was gonna happen? ♪ You asked me to sign my name ♪ ♪ On a piece of paper ♪ ♪ In black ink ♪ ♪ So I signed it "P.S., I love you" ♪ ♪ Whoa-oh-oh ♪ ♪ You're finally in my life ♪ ♪ Whoa-oh-oh ♪ ♪ You're finally in my life forevermore ♪ ♪ Whoa-oh-oh ♪ ♪ You're finally in my life forevermore ♪ Go! I am not prepared to admit to the power of the veil, but I will say we have been to a lot of weddings lately. Oh, okay! How's Matteo doing in the store on his own, with you guys in Italy? So well, and the replica veil has become a best-seller. I love these long weekends where we get to be together, and we get to hear all about your videos. And we can go antiquing. And we can hear about you living in Italy. And we can go antiquing! And we can make a reservation for brunch. And we can go antiquing! Perfect. Speaking of antiques... do you remember that Venetian mirror that I love? Oh, you sent us photos. Mm-hmm. Paolo bought it for me for my birthday! - Really? - What? Yes. It's so beautiful. Please tell me you can come out and see it soon... and me? Of course! Of course we'll make that happen. You know, I'm thinking, though, that it might have an interesting history that you need to look into. Hmm... you know, I was actually thinking the exact same thing. - Of course. - Matteo and Lily are coming to Italy for their honeymoon, so I thought I would do some research, and maybe we could do some videos while they're there, - because... - Because you are... "Everyone's Favorite Art Historian!" You're gonna do it every time? Yeah, we're gonna do it every time. Every time! Speaking of honeymoons, though... Oh, I know, okay? We'll make it happen. We will. We also need to decide where the veil's going next. Do you guys think it's time for it to go back to New York? To Nick's sisters? Have I dropped enough hints? Yes, I would love that, if I could take it to them. Then it's settled. Oh, but what about the christening gown? Do you want me to send that to New York, too? I... think I should probably keep that with me in Italy for at least the next seven months or so. Are you...? Oh, my gosh, that's amazing! Best news. Aww. Time for our toast. Two champagnes and one bubbly apple juice. Ahh... to friendship. To the veil. And to all the amazing women who have worn it. Aw! So, in the first hour of meeting Paolo, he helped me buy a ticket for the vaporetto... True. Helped me with my Italian... Also true. - Found my lost ticket... - Yes. Saved me from falling into a canal... Naturally. Helped me find the lace shop that made my veil... My shop. - And bought me coffee. - "Espresso". So... naturally, I fell in love with him. These things happen in Italy. Ciao!
