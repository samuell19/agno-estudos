Are you ready now? Yep. Smile. Oh, sorry. Smile again. APPLAUSE My name is Trinity Porter and I am Miss Nude Sydney. I'm Summer Stevens, Miss Erotica Australia for 2007. My measurements are 36... sorry, fuck! My name's Ellashaye, I won Miss Nude Tasmania. I am Jessie Jackson and my hobbies include ballet, forensic science and body sculpting. I'm Suzie Q, I'm from Sydney. I'm Miss Nude New South Wales. My name's Mackenzie and I'm Miss Nude Hobart. The Miss Nude Australia is a pageant that is so credible and so bona fide that it helps the girls to progress. I love watching rugby union and I love reading. Strippers can read. Yes. Girls, uh, can I just have five minutes of your time here? Can everyone just turn their phones off? This is very important to you because I'm going to explain the judging criteria, and what I'm going to read to you now is exactly what we say to the judges every night. Word for word, this is read to them. So you'll know what the judging criteria is and exactly what they're judging on, okay? Now, the judges, the first thing we say to them, "These contestants have invested a lot into this pageant. "You have a responsibility and obligation "to bring the same concentration, organisation and effort "as the contestants. "We're not judging biggest breasts, we're not judging the longest legs, "nor are we judging the tightest arse. "Her face - is it a natural one, "or does she just flash her pearly teeth? "Her hair - is it healthy and does it complement her face?" The bottom line of the competition is that it is a beauty pageant. There's a $20,000 prize to one of you. Thanks very, very much for coming and all the very best. It's such a unique week to be able to go out there and be naked and keep a smile on their face and put on such a fantastic performance. It's just amazing. The Miss Nude Australia is the pageant that is the mother of all pageants. Makes you feel like a movie star when you're not really a movie star. Anyone that's made it through to the Miss Nude Australia in any particular year, it means that they've done really well in their own state. Oh, my God! You feel like you're standing there for ever, you're getting this big... your teeth are getting... your jaw's getting sore from the big smile. I love to see the girls being so competitive. The costuming and the music and the presentation of their shows is just amazing. There's no... there's no hidden agenda. It's entertainment, of good quality and good standard. Something to tell the grandkids. The girl who's just got that little bit more and that little bit of oomph is going to be the winner. The girls to watch out for and why? Everybody. Yeah, I like tattoos. It's a fighting fish. It's not quite finished yet. My mother, oh! She never has one nice thing to say about it. When she saw it, she lost it, she was so pissed off! We do not want to speak about the tattoo. I spent a fortune with baby powders and creams to make sure that she was perfect, and I could not believe that she would get such a hideous and gross, deformed-looking, out-of-control, ghastly, vomitous, you name it... I can't think of enough hideous adjectives to describe that gross thing on her arm. That turns her from being very classy to yuck! I don't like it. Hi. So, I'm taking everybody back to where it all began. Now, something that you might notice about this place is there's a pole out the front. When I first said that I was going to be a stripper to my parents, they weren't surprised at all because I'd spent hours and hours and hours spinning and climbing and mucking around on the pole out the front, and it was always the family joke that I would become a stripper. Well, certainly the standing joke in the neighbourhood when Lori was little, because she loved swinging on the pole out the front of our house, the standing joke was that she'd be, could possibly be, a pole dancer. So while we were shocked that the reality came about, the other half wasn't. LIVELY GUITAR MUSIC My biggest problem is... it's not something that I want to tell my mother and father and the grandparents more than anything, that that is what she does. This was our fashion parade catwalk Mum used to make us do little shows on when we were younger. It was good practice for Miss Nude Australia when we're doing our parades. I just think of old times and off I go. Costume. Skirt. Shorts. Bra. G. Jacket. How could I forget my prop? How nice. HONKS Formal wear. Check with jewellery and shoes. Yep, and me. That's it. I'm so excited! I've never been to Adelaide! This is my little kitty playhouse and I use it during my show to kind of crawl amongst... and, you know, do some sexy little poses. Yep, it's not going to fit, I'm telling you. Having any title is beneficial but, you know, when you book in a gig, you're wanting somebody special, and when somebody says "How about Miss Nude Australia?" people are just... they jump at the chance, they absolutely, you know, they want to see the best of the best. You are, that's what the title says. Ladies and gentlemen, Miss Nude Australia 1995, here at the Crazy Horse, here's Juicy Lucy! OLD-FASHIONED FRENCH SONG The pageant's been going since... it started in '91, the pageant. We were very lucky to have Miss Nude World here, Heaven Lee. She came out from the States and she awarded the girl with her crown and with her sash. Miss Nude Australia 1991, which was a lady called Michelle Lane. If they're very focused and they really know what they want out of the industry, whether they want to have recognition or whether they want financial, it's all here for them. Morgan Summers, she was Miss Nude South Australia, Miss Nude Australia, Miss Nude World, Miss Nude Universe, all virtually within those 18 months of this girl winning the South Australia's... Went ahead and won every possible pageant. OLD-FASHIONED FRENCH SONG Ultimately it comes down to the fact that strippers or exotic dancers are just regular women who do something slightly interesting as a job. It doesn't mean, all the time, that they're prostitutes, it doesn't mean they're on drugs, that they're not intelligent, it doesn't mean they don't have other options in their life. The majority of them choose to do it because it's something that they love to do. It doesn't mean you can grab their arse, it doesn't mean they're going to have sex with you. I don't know what... It doesn't mean they're a slut, anything like that - it's just their job, okay, and they usually love it, so... HONKY TONK MUSIC This was the first time I entered Miss Nude - look at that. Miss Nude New South Wales, Miss Petite, 2003. I was really bad. My bedroom. My pole. Can't do much on it because you end up with one foot in the cupboard and the other one, like, out the window, but you can try. I don't think you have to be a straight-out exhibitionist to be an exotic dancer, but I think you do need to have some element of some... that same thing that actors have, that they want to perform and have people look at them and that kind of thing. I don't know - I have this secret theory that we're just dancers who, you know, couldn't cut it or just realised that we'd never earn very much money as dancers. So, you know, if we take our clothes off, hey, we can make a living out of this. To all the women out there who are offended by what we do, we're just like you. Yeah, you know, I get up, I eat breakfast, I walk the dog, I pay my bills, it's the same thing, it's just my way of paying my bills is slightly different to you. My current boyfriend I met in a strip club, so technically the first thing he knew about me before he even knew my name was that I was an exotic dancer, but it has still been a source of much contention in our relationship, unfortunately. He doesn't like my job at all. At all, at all... But even after all these years he doesn't seem to quite understand that it's not real. I understand that most people out of the industry don't get that it's fantasy. But he's been to shows and everything with me and seen me do same thing over and over and over and still thinks that it's, like, this real... like I'm this crazy sexual person or whatever, and he's like, "I can't reconcile that with who you are off stage." I'm like, "It's not real." But that said, I don't think any guy is going to like other men looking at his girlfriend naked, really. And I don't know if I want a guy who's like, "Yeah, that's totally fine, whatever," kind of thing. You know, I want someone to care about me enough to say something. But at the same time I don't want it to destroy my relationship. Miss Nude Australia is one of the most... if not the most, sort of prestigious exotic dance pageants, and just to make it into the Australian final is... I'm really excited about, it's really cool to finally be down here in Adelaide. This is called a lyra, which is basically a hula hoop that you hang from the ceiling, except it's stainless steel. For this comp, I'm going to try a new thing. I'm trying out naked lyra, so it's going to either end really badly or look really cool. I would love to win it, just because of the opportunities that it presents. You can approach international clubs and that kind of thing, which means more travel opportunities, more chances to work overseas. But it hooks up there, so you'll keep it up all through, or will it be put up? It's like a big hula hoop, so it's just going to have to stay up there. So we'll have to attach it away... like, up? Yeah, Karen mentioned... Yeah? You've got to be careful that nothing distracts those judges. That you've got their attention from the time you come on stage till you actually take your bow at the end to leave the stage. So when the guys come on - the girls want tarpaulins put down in the middle of the show or a bath put on, something like that, it takes away from you. ROMANTIC MUSIC Maybe I should take the sock off. Shoe and sock. Your tattoo. That would save you heaps of time. Stand on my toe, shoe, sock, then I wouldn't even have to go down. Don't want to watch the other girls in case it puts me off. I get all intimidated. They're all pretty good. Some competitions, you feel that you're sort of cut out to meet the criteria. I don't 100% feel that I am cut out to meet the criteria of this competition. If it was purely a performance thing, I'd probably have more of a chance. But because of this whole beauty pageant side of it, and me... I don't know if I'm a beauty queen. I'm trying. BURLESQUE-STYLE SONG My interests are boxing, dancing, singing and sex. Five-star hotels, boys... Sleeping, shopping, having sex.. I just pretend that when I'm on stage, I'm having sex with the Invisible Man. That's my style. (Laughs) That's why I'm Jessie Rude. Initial entrance to the stage is with a glamorous costume. As glittery and as feathery as possible. You know, very Vegas, very Parisienne-type sort of costume. Following that, they start unrobing with the second track, by the third track they're down to their bikinis. There is a certain amount of floor work they do and of course now they do a lot of work on the poles as well. Being able to create an amazing presence up on stage, and to dance and to disrobe and to be up against, you know, all the finalists, from every state, is an amazing ability. WOMAN SINGS: # I'm supposed to be a lady... # It makes them concentrate more on their performance and their act, rather than just being explicit and, "Here's my boobs. "Here's my fanny, have a look," you know, sort of thing. Then it's more about the performance of the show. It all adds to the grand finale of them being naked and then entering the birdbath or the shower at the end here. WOMAN SINGS: # A bit of hanky panky and some how's-your-father # Is right up his street, his cup of tea # Right up his street, you wait and see # I'll tickle his feet and then he'll marry me. # For me, dancing, really dancing and taking clothes off at the same time, is perfect for me, it's the perfect formula for my dancing. Just being cheeky. They started it. Really, really love what I do. I get a little bit passionate about it. ROMANTIC FRENCH SONG I like the era when ladies were ladies and men were men. I like that. I wish it would go back to that. I would like to be stuck in the 1940s, you know, there's all the wives wearing curlers and they're feeding the animals and smoking in their dressing gowns, but they all look a million dollars. That era where everyone was beautiful and everyone took pride in their appearance and men slicked their hair back, and they're all handsome looking. I like that era, that's something I wish I had've been a part of. This is all I've done for six years so, to put a costume and to take it off, it's really the art of taking it off that I'm interested in. Anyone can take their clothes off but can you do it... with a bit of style or a bit of class or a bit of something... We get to wear costumes, and the music and everything's beautiful, but this is the things in the industry that people don't know about. You know, you can show up at a buck's party and do your thing and there's always going to be one in the crowd that gets... makes himself feel better by making you feel like this. You know, because he's got issues of his own that are not dealt with. So that annoys me, you know, that you go out there to be an entertainer and yet there's someone to drag you down. There's always one guy that wants to degrade you or speak down to you and has no idea of who you are in real life. I'm really sick to death of guys thinking they're above these girls. We're there to do a job, you pay us to go there. You don't have that right. No one has that right to speak to anyone that way. The photo work is totally different to stripping. When it comes to nude modelling, it's you and your photographer and your stylist on the day. If you go to a group of strangers and try to do something like this, well, when you get naked, you don't know, yeah, so it's good. If you have a good network and a good support base, you'll be fine. This is my magazine that come out last week. It's not on the shelves any more, it just got sold out. So if you have a look... Are you allowed to have nudity on this? This is the layout of it all. So, my interview, if you read this it shows that... It's got nothing smutty in it or anything yucky. It's not my personality. So this magazine is only topless. Yes, you're fully nude, but there's no open leg work in this. This is all closed leg. And I've done People magazine. That comes out later on in the year. This is the first photo shoot I've done since I had my breast implants done. This magazine, Penthouse, is open leg. That's where I went straight into the deep end, straight to Penthouse. SUBDUED PIANO MUSIC I think it takes a certain type of person to have it in them to love to do what they do. But I love dancing, I was a ballroom and Latin dancer as a child, from the age of 12. My father teaches rock 'n' roll. My dad has never set foot in a strip club. He's never... no. That industry, he wouldn't even know where to begin with it. Imagine him walking into the Crazy Horse and seeing all the things that are going on there, on stage - that would blow his mind. Blow his mind. If I knew that I could tell him and he'd be fine with it, then I would. But because I know the devastation... Because he would go, "I've done something wrong." You know, like, "Why would she do this? "Is it because of the divorce? Is it because..." You know, parents blame themselves when their children do things that they wouldn't, that aren't what normal kids do. He would be proud to see me in my costumes. The whole start of it would be awesome! You know, the whole... Perfect! Soon as those boobs come out, "Hang on! Put them away!" You know? No, no, no! My dad always says to my girlfriends whenever he meets them, "My daughter, she's such a wonderful dancer. "She's so incredibly talented." My dad is actually right. I really can dance, but... I take my clothes off at the end of it. My connection with the Crazy Horse goes back... coming up to 27 years ago, actually. I was employed here as the resident choreographer back in 1980, '81, and have been here ever since. You are creating a character, you're creating... You are, you know, the minute, the minute my wig goes on and my lipstick goes on, I'm not thinking the way Joseph thinks any more. I'm thinking the way that Madame Josephine is thinking. And, basically, you know, it's... And you've got to think about the way you hold your hands, the way you speak, the way you project yourself, you've got to think feminine, you've got to think female. And basically, that's how it all works. Because it's a character now, it's not Joseph any more. You've created that character, and that character is Madame Josephine. I'm scared of my eyelashes, I am! That's beautiful. You've got beautiful tits, by the way. (Woman laughs) They are absolutely gorgeous! Almost as big as Madame's, but yours are big. Are they your own or are they silicone? They're mine. They're your own? Au naturel? They are beautiful. Are you single or married? Married. Married. Oh my God, the husband must be in awe. He loves them! He loves them! Does he do the... what do they call that, Spanish? Or, yeah... That's my mum. That's your mum? That's all right! She's got big ones too, but yours are bigger, though, aren't they? Madame knows exactly what to say... in the right way to make a girl push harder, to strive harder. She tells it the way it is. She doesn't beat around the bush. The way it is is the way it is with her. You know, I do show a lot of compassion towards the girls and for the work that they're doing, it's just amazing. Whether it's a birthmark or whether it's a little bit of cellulite, or whether it's, you know, too much... too much of a good thing over the winter months. You know, a bit of winter warmth on our body, that's... They're exposed, and it's exposed to criticism. Therefore, you can come backstage and see someone really upset over something that a punter has said, and I feel for that. So I take time out in explaining to the person that, you know, even myself as an entertainer, you know, you... there are people that have had one too many drinks or they're just generally unkind people. "You judge a human being on her skills and talents, "not on any outside prop or special effects. "These will be scored on how well "the contestant utilised these tools "and not how fancy or expensive they are. "You score down tattoos or defects if they bother you personally. "If these tattoos or defects do not detract "from your idea of a beautiful woman, ignore them. "If they bother you, score them accordingly." This is our DJ information sheet. So, what lighting we want during our show and what sort of songs and what times. I'm going to sit into the crowd, get them to take my socks off. I've got little bobby socks on. I'll get them to touch my feet so they feel they're part of it. Da-da da-da! Cutesy, cutesy. Yep. Knickers off when it goes "Wild thing". Take my knickers off. The run of the show's been done, and just the final details are being prepared. All the girls now know where they're performing this evening and what order they're performing. Number seven. You got last. Suzie, you get last every single time! Every time. JOSEPH: It is a bit chaotic, but let's hope... First night, let's hope it runs smoothly. We're looking forward to it. One more time, ladies and gentlemen, let's put our hands together for the very, very beautiful ladies at the Crazy Horse this evening. I think I can hear them ready backstage. Let's put our hands together, audience, come on, a bit of... a bit of excitement in the audience! FRANTIC FRENCH SONG What I like, seeing the girls competing, they... it gets to about Thursday, they know the cut's going to come the next day. FRENCH SONG CONTINUES They pull out any trick that they could possibly pull out, you know. We take it seriously. I certainly don't look at judging it and being able to just tick a box and think, okay, well, let's just get this over and done with. FRENCH SONG CONTINUES The girls get judged nightly on the best legs, best butts, most luscious lungs, hottest body and sensuous woman. So basically, those categories, there are awarded trophies for each of those categories. The main sheet that the judges have got, they score the ladies on facial beauty, on body, pole work, personality and talent and the beauty queen image. All scores out of 10, and they're added up. This is where the high and the low scores, where judges being preferential etcetera, hard on some, easier on others, that's how we... it has to be, that's how you sort them out. But you can see tonight, there's very, very little, very, very little in this competition. So the judges are now judging for hottest body, Madame. Yeah, I know they are, and they're all looking and it's great because it sort of gives them a... They've seen them individually and now they can actually see them all standing together and so it gives the judges a good window of... You know, of basically judging correctly because only one girl can win Australia's Hottest Body, Morgan. Yes, they can. Only one girl will be awarded that title tomorrow night. But of course there is Australia's Hottest Legs, Most Luscious... Luscious Lungs. Yeah, Best Buns! That's my favourite one. Is it? I will admit, the best way to judge a lot of girls' bums would be to get them all to stand there and look at their bums. But it is quite, like, I know this is going to sound funny but, like, standing up like meat. Because we have different judges each night, a different girl could win any time, like, it just depends entirely on what the judges want. Like, you might have a bunch of judges that like natural boobs, or ones that just like big fake boobs. So what happens is, when they cut you here they push the implant through, they cut your breast tissue away from your actual rib cage. They put the implant in and your breast tissue covers it. So when you feel them, it's my breast tissue you're feeling, you don't feel the implant at all. You don't know where it starts and where it finishes. So I have to massage them for 15 minutes every day, and it's fun anyway. It's nerve wracking being, like, kind of a pale-skinned redhead with real boobs, up against, you know, these amazing, like, blonde goddesses with surgically enhanced boobs and everything, and their beautiful tans and everything. It's a bit intimidating. Dad was all for it, Mum was completely against it. When I told her, she was crying which... I never felt so bad. It is her life. So, you know, scars and unattractive bits and pieces, you don't want them. Yeah, so we kind of had a bit of a moment and I said "No, don't worry, Mum, it's going to be okay. "It's going to be okay." And off I went to Thailand. Great hospital - Yanhee International with Dr Pitch. They were really, really nice. And went in and did it, and there they were and Mum was quite surprised at how nice they came, not too big... Yeah, I was, I was happy... happy when I saw her. A, that she was alive and she wasn't riddled with some overseas disease. She goes "Oh, do you want a look?" Of course I said "Yes, I do." And I was pleased that she hadn't gone Dolly Parton or Pamela Anderson and turned herself into some sort of plastic-looking ridiculous person. I hate people asking "Do you get turned on "while you're on stage or when you're doing a show?" Like, if I'm upside down in my hoop or whatever, and I'm, like, 10 metres above a concrete floor, I'm really not thinking about gettin' off. The most amusing type of audience member is the guy that's looking in your eyes and then making a really big deal of having eye contact with you. They're like this, you're doing whatever you can and they're like this the whole time. You turn away for two seconds, perhaps open your legs, you turn back and their view's right there. Like, it's very funny. Every time, every time. I noticed last night watching in Adelaide that there doesn't seem to be a lot of laws about open leg work and things like that, whereas in WA it's a lot stricter. I don't know whether that means we're backward and they're ahead of us, or whether we're ahead and they're backward and behind us - I'm not sure which. But I noticed that it's quite a bit different over here. Which I think puts our girls at a disadvantage, actually, because they prepare their shows and perform their shows in WA to our crowds and to our standards and then they come here and say, "They're allowed to do so much more here." And they have to actually adapt their show a little bit to try and compete with the other girls. I want to see you at the Moulin Rouge. Where it's all, you know, really glamorous and elegant... Yeah. Full on and whatever. They don't get nude enough for me. Oh! Okay. It's nude enough for me, but anyway... It's your pink bits, so what can I say? Whether you go into clubs, pubs, people that come to competitions or book you for private shows, you get such a mix. They're young, they're old, they're, you know, Lebanese, they're Asian, they're Australian, they're politicians. They're B-grade celebrities, they're fathers, they're brothers, 95% of them are fine, they all just want to see a beautiful girl doing a good show at the end of the day. I got a request to go and do a show in an intensive care unit in a hospital. I got a phone call saying, "Ellashaye, you've been requested, they want you. "We don't know exactly what's going on there, "but we know it's an 18-year-old boy and we know he's dying, "and he's requested for you to do a show there." SOMBRE MUSIC So we walked into the hospital and I met the boy's... As I was going into the room, his mother come out. I don't know if you've ever seen a mother who knows that she's going to lose her son... Oh God, I'm going to cry. There's nothing that you will ever see in your whole life, to know... to see that look on someone's face. And lose their son, and you're going to go in there... I don't know if it's the only time he's ever seen a naked girl, but you're going in there to someone's deathbed, literally. And they said to me "Look, he's dying of a brain tumour, "he's got a few days left to live, he's on life support, "he's had a stroke on one side of his body." On one side of the room there's all these friends, young boys, you know, they're like, "Yeah, the stripper's here!" On the other side are his family who are absolutely devastated. So I don't know if you can understand, or begin to imagine, what it's like to have two different energies. Yeah, these boys are mourning their friend, but it was like they weren't accepting what was actually going on. Like, I took my glove off and I gave it to him and one of his eyes would open and he knew who I was and what I was doing in there, he knew exactly that connection of, "I know what you're doing. And you know what I'm doing." Something I've never experienced in my life. So I did the show... and I left... and I lost it when I walked out of there. It gutted me to think that that was it. You know what I mean? I was never going to see that boy again and that moment that we had, that acknowledgement that he was there and I was there, it was pretty full on. And then four days later, I got a message from the agency. The family had texted a message to the agency just saying, "We want to thank Ellashaye for her time in doing the show, "but we want to let you know that he's passed away, "but we're truly thankful." If someone asked me to do that again? I don't know if I'd do it. Good morning, Crazy Horse. Yeah, hi. This is Trinity from the Miss Nude competition. I'm just calling to see whether I've made it into the finals tonight. Ah, yes, you are. I did? (Squeals) Yay! Hi, this is Mackenzie. I'm ringing to find out about the finals. Yeah, unfortunately you didn't make it into the final. Oh, okay. You're still required to be here at 8-ish for the parades. Yep. All right? All right, thank you very much. Bye... Nah. Really? Oh well, that's it. It's not exactly the career choice I would have chosen for her, and I was flabbergasted when she initially told us. PHONE RINGS Good morning, Crazy Horse. Hi Jared, it's Dee. How you going? You're in the final. So we'll see you tonight at 8 p.m. All right? Bye. That was Dee, Danielle Dare. She's happy. I'm proud. I really am. Shut up or I'm going to hit you. Be more, like theatrical. Get out. It's sort of like, (flat) "Who's this? Dee, you made it." Why don't you go "Hi, Dee! Congratulations! You've made it!" How about a bit of... If they were like that on the phone I might be a bit more jovial. Understand that they're ringing because their lives are on the line. They're ringing to think, "What am I going to hear at the other end?" But if they hear a happy person, maybe they'll think, "Oh wow! He sounds happy. He's going to give me some happy news." Instead of (flat) "Oh, you made it, you're in the final." Just something... "Hi, Dee." All those acting classes that I paid for you all these years obviously haven't worked, have they? Yeah. Sort of throughout the day I just got some messages from different groups of people - we've sort of pieced together... I think we've figured out who six of the girls are who've gotten in, but I don't know who the final two are. Find out tonight. At the end of the night there's going to be one very happy person there tonight - very happy. Whether the audience agrees with it, whether the... the agents and club owners agree with it, that's besides the point. One girl is going to be a very happy girl and we'll just rely on what the judges' decision is going to be. Shall we go to the club now? Are you excited? MAN SINGS FRENCH SONG My God, I'm freaking out, and I'm not even in it. I'm so excited. It's so good. FRENCH SONG CONTINUES You know, it gets really tense. I go through it every year and I've been through it every year. When it comes to the announcements of, you know, the awards at the end of the night, oh, that's nerve-wracking! First! Praying to the stripper gods. Somebody else has got to take it over. All the best to her. She needs it. It's a hard year. If you're your own boss, then it's a lot easier for you I guess, but if you work for a club, then they make sure that you've... you perform a lot. And it begins. Thank you very much. Good evening, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Crazy Horse in Adelaide and Miss Nude Australia 2008. Another one, Morgan! Oh, another week, and what a fantastic week it's been here. The girls have been fantastic. FRENCH SONG CONTINUES Good luck, everybody! The girls backstage, how is it tonight? Oh, you know, it's a bit nervous, anxious, excited. It's all the good stuff. I'm very much relieved. I'll shove it on the next person. Seriously... I'm done. You are going to have a great night, let me promise that much to you. Yes! The line-up is absolutely fantastic. Go Perth! Go WA! Yeah! All right, ladies and gentlemen and judges, we'll start tonight's entertainment here at the Crazy Horse... As a performer, I guess there really is nothing more thrilling than having the yes factor, and that's what I really brought to this competition - is the entertainment factor. First contestant on stage. We need rousing applause for the very beautiful... Trinity Porter! BURLESQUE-STYLE SONG Things come to those who wait, but only the things left by those who hustle, and I don't want to get the dribs and drabs, I want to hustle and I want to get the good jobs and win the competitions and, you know, make the most money and do what I can so when it's my time to finish up I can finish up on a high. Go, Trinity! APPLAUSE, CHEERS It's always hard going first. Any showgirl will tell you that, it's so hard going first. Because it's early in the night, it's early in the shows, you know, so people aren't sort of used to everything so it's just kind of... I... yeah. Sorry, I'm just so nervous. Yeah, it's so hard. But I think I did awesome. I never do a bad show. With a big round of applause, come on, let's hear it for Ellashaye! FRENCH SONG I'm enjoying myself. It's the first time I've ever competed for this sort of thing. The presentation has to be immaculate. Everything counts, everything. I own that stage, that's mine for 15 minutes. I'm going to rock it and that's it, end of story. (Laughs) I've never had sex with a sponge like that ever in my life. Not like that. We've done it before, but never like that. Hope it will respect me in the morning. Like, if you're not out there watching everybody's show and everything that you're doing, you're backstage, and you hear the crowd, like, roar at certain points and you're like, "My God, what is she doing? "Is she doing some amazing thing I'd never have any chance of doing?" FRENCH MUSIC With a big round of applause, come on, let's hear it for Suzie Q! My best asset in my performance is kind of characterisation. Like, I like to play kind of characters, at least at the start of my show. SOLEMN MUSIC MUSIC BUILDS I'd love to win Miss Nude. I feel I'm at a point in my career where I seem to be doing really well. (Laughs) And this would just help sort of push me up to the next level. MAJESTIC MUSIC I chucked in more acrobatic stuff. I was like, "I've got to do some acrobatic stuff" and I was a bit puffed when I came off stage, not enough sexy stuff, not enough sexy face. I do have a couple of favourites, but you've got standouts as far as personality, standouts in body, you've got standouts in, you know, as far as beauty queen. You know, they all stand out in their own segments. There's probably no one that actually stands out in all categories, but it's going to be a tight... there's going to be a tight competition. Miss Nude Australia 2008, Hottest New Talent. Let's put our hands together for Trinity Porter! The one perhaps something that in the back of my mind I worry about long term is... nice men don't usually marry strippers. So from a long-term point of view, I'm hoping that once she's had enough of what she's doing that she does meet somebody who can appreciate her intelligence and her enthusiasm and her strengths and appreciate what she's done without judging her. You know, I'm not going to be doing this for ever. I'm not going to have a firm arse for ever, my boobs aren't always going to be, you know, not everything's going to be perfect, so I need to make the best of what it is now and then, like, I don't know, I want to succeed and I want to make a career out of it, so I guess I do need to look at it as a business. I am a product, I need to sell me. I'd... you know, I'd rather her be married to Prince Harry or something like that. But that's not where she's going, so what can I do about it? Nothing. Just love her. Okay, Miss Nude Australia, Entertainer of the Year, with a big round of applause, ladies and gentlemen, it goes to Ellashaye! Miss Entertainer of the Year. I'm really, really happy with it. It's well-deserved, for sure. Thank you, I really appreciate it. I'm truly, truly happy with it. Next year I'm going to come back. I don't feel I left with anything that I didn't deserve or anything, because I gave it my all. And I showed who I was and so I'm leaving my mark on the industry, and a positive one. I'm not going to be the girl washed up with a drug problem or anything like that, because it's not all negative, and it's not all positive. But it's a lot of fun. All right, ladies and gentlemen, this is the one, this is the biggie. Ladies and gentlemen, Miss Nude Australia 2008 winner, with a big round of applause, let's hear it for Suzie Q! WILD APPLAUSE POIGNANT PIANO MUSIC He's going to be asleep. Still asleep. Wake up, dude, come on. It's difficult. His latest thing is that he doesn't want me to become a diva, and that's why he's putting me back in my place. I'm like, "No, dude, you're putting me down." That's different. So much for the excited "Hi!" You know what, I deserve someone who's going to love and respect me and I've said to him, if you're up for that, if you can do that, that's cool, we can make something happen, but if you're not, uh... (Girls chat) GENTLE MUSIC Thank you very much. 45 Gs in one year. How much better does it get? $45,000 this girl's won. GENTLE PIANO MUSIC Yeah, I can't believe I won best bottom. Strange. Anyway, apparently I have a nice bum. I think it can be a very sexy experience for the viewers, but I think... I don't know... in an ideal world isn't it more about appreciating, like, the beauty of the female form? No, it's not, is it? It's just about them getting turned on by a sexy girl doing sexy things. Damn. Captions (c) SBS Australia 2009
