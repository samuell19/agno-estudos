Can you take your school bag? - Yes. Right, you take that, and I'll take this. Can you manage? Take your time. There! Oh, sorry! What the hell are you doing here? Daddy! Thomas, come to me. Hey, kiddo. Look who's here. It's been a long time. I just want to eat you all up. Thomas, come to mummy... Thomas! Are you OK? - I'm fine. Right then, do you want to box? That's enough, Jan. - For real, OK? Show me what you can do. Listen, now! That's enough. Calm down. - Harder. Come on, show me. Come here. Stop it! Stop it! Come here. Come to me. - Leave him be! Come here! Let go of him! Shit. Didier? It's Pascale. Listen, call me back as soon as you can. Jan is here. He's still here. It stings. Shit. Where's my cup? - Why the hell are you still here, Jan? Do you know where my cup is? - You promised you'd leave. I've been thinking. I'm staying, Pascale. Mummy, why are you breaking plates? Daddy, why's mummy... - Ask her yourself. Because your father's crazy, Thomas. That's why. Why are you crazy? Because I've decided to stay. Daddy says he's staying. - Yes. Do you know why he's staying? - No. Because he loves your mummy. Come here. There goes my cup. Don't touch it. Are you alright? Here, sweep it up. Thomas, take this. OK. Is mummy angry? Yes. She's angry. But you mustn't worry. Even if mummy's angry, I love her. Forever. Even if she doesn't want me any more, I still want her. See? Could you live without mummy? - No. Neither can daddy. You mustn't worry. Daddy'll make it all alright. You'll see. It'll all work out in the end. Hey! How are you? Wow, looks great. I think we're ready. Look, Didier. We're Indians, and we're not afraid of anything. You're the bear. - I don't want to play right now, Thomas. Oh, go on. You be the bear. - I don't want to. Go on. This is where you sleep. You can hibernate here. We'll come and visit you. Maybe... we should hunt the bear? Don't you think? No, he's a kind bear. We'll go and visit him for tea. Do you think so? I think we ought to hunt him, before he eats us all up. - No... We've got to kill him. - We'll have tea with him. You think so? What are you doing? I've had enough. Let's go back. We'll call the cops and have him evicted. Enough is enough. - I can't leave, Didier. I'm sorry, but... Work it out with him. Give me a call when everything's settled. I'm sick of it. Wait, Didier. Please, wait. This is our home. He's got to leave. I can't do it on my own. So? I can't live with your mother any more. I'm sorry. I just can't. Thomas, come to mummy. - Why? Don't talk back. - I don't want to. Thomas, come here right now. Come on. Right, what's going on, Jan? I don't get it. You said you were leaving. I'm still here. - You agreed. It was all settled. You can't just change your mind. - Why not? You were at the lawyer's. You signed. We were all agreed. I changed my mind. I'm staying. - But you signed! I made a mistake. - What is this, Jan? It's not possible. - Yes, it is. It could happen to anyone. You were unfaithful to me, weren't you? You can't do this, Jan. - Yes, I can. You took everything I have! That's not true. - It is true! But you'll never take my son. If I have to leave here, I'll break everything. I'll do myself in. That's what you want, isn't it? You want me dead. Mummy. What's wrong, Thomas? - No, go away. Go away. What's going on? - Go away. Wait, I'll get you some other trousers. Can I come in? - Yes. Here. What's wrong? Eh? It doesn't matter. Here you are. Wait, don't put it on straight away. Wash yourself. You've done a wee-wee. Take your underpants off. There... Alright? Wash yourself. No, take everything off. There you go. It's cold. - Too cold? Wait. It's hot. - Too hot? No, it's alright. - Is that alright? Stop! - Wait. No, I killed you. You've still got that one. But that's my last man. - It's my last man, too. There's another one, here. - There're only two left. They're talking. I'm sorry about earlier. It was... a bit over the top. Pascale always goes too fast. She stops too soon. Me, I... I stop too late. That's the way it goes. It's not easy. There's not much left. - There's nothing left. Daddy says he still loves you. I don't love him any more. Is daddy angry? - Yes. But are you still friends? Just a teeny weeny bit? Yes, a teeny weeny weeny bit. So daddy can stay? No, he can't. We argue all the time. Besides, Didier's here now. Yes, but he can stay too. Thomas, it wouldn't be a good idea. What would you like to eat? Take a few more. Go on. No, you must eat it. - Go on, Thomas. Do you want some water? Yes, a little bit. Stop. There. - I'm going to tell you a joke. Go on, then. I'm listening. What's invisible and stinks of carrots? Thomas, could you pass me the pâté? Pass me the pâté. - The clock's ticking: tick, tock... Thomas... What's invisible and stinks of carrots? Thomas, pass me the pâté, please. Well? Don't you know? What? - What is invisible and stinks of carrots? No, I don't know. - A rabbit fart. What's pink and swings around all the time? What's pink and swings around all the time? Do you give up? What's pink and swings around all the time? Give up? - What is it? You give up? - I give up. A bubble-gum stuck on Tarzan's arse. Have you heard the one about... about... Oh yes, about the cat... - Enough of the jokes now, Thomas. Would you like a piece of cake? About the cat... - Thomas, do you want some cake? There's this cat who does a pooh in the desert, but he doesn't know what to wipe himself with. You don't know what he can use? - I don't know. What's the matter, cat got your tongue? Maybe he's using it to wipe his bum! - That's enough of your jokes. Where on earth did you learn such filth? Wait, I've got another one... - That's enough, stop it. No, no, no. I've got another one... - Be quiet now, alright? Be quiet. That's enough, we've had a good laugh. Toto's teacher says... - Thomas, please. ...count to 10. One, two, three, four... six, seven, eight, nine, ten. - Thomas, listen... You've missed one, Toto. Sorry 'f I've missed anything, Miss. Thomas, please. Have you had enough to eat? Really! What bad manners. Thomas, that's enough. Calm down. You're much too excited. We're stupid, aren't we? Aren't we stupid? I don't think it's funny. We've had a good laugh, but it's over now. - Slice of bread. You want some more bread? You're sure you'll eat it? Do you want this little bit? It's nice and fresh. Chocolate on one side, honey on the other. - No more jokes. I'm starting... - Thomas, stop. Are you listening to me? You stop it, now. Stop telling your jokes! Thomas, listen to Didier. There... Listen, you're way too excited. You'll go straight to bed if you don't watch out. You can go and calm yourself down in the kitchen if you don't stop. Listen, Thomas. I'm asking you to stop. Is that clear? We're stupid, aren't we? - Now stop it. Stop it, OK? Stop now. No, that's enough. OK? Sorting stuff out? - Yes. Your stuffs on the other side. There. You can have it. - No, thanks. You can keep it. What? Are you planning on having children... with Didier? What's going to happen with Thomas? I can't live without him! He's all I've got left. We could try again. Go and see Didier. Screw him. I won't say a word. Listen, one day he'll shit his underpants too. Stop it, now. - Ten years from now he'll be old like me. Stop it. You're so tiresome, Jan. Everybody leaves you. It's not surprising. You're impossible to live with. You're selfish. I stayed for a long time. I wanted to help you, Jan. But it's over now. I loved you. I loved you so much... Let go of me. You disgust me now. No, no! Stop it! Let go of me. - Bitch! Filthy cunt! Let go of her! Let go of her! Will you be alright? - Hello. I've got my license. Alright, alright, turn again. Let go of her! Stop it! Stop it, and get out! Get the hell out of here! I don't know... This is the right place. Jesus... What's going on? Is Jan here? Jan's still here. He's gone crazy. Is he in the house? - Yes. But it was all agreed. - I know. Where is he? - In there. He went completely crazy. He's been here since this morning. We've just had a fight. Should we come back later? - No, don't be silly. How did it happen? Crazy bastard! What should we do? - Shall we unload? Why not? I'm damned if I'll let him stop us. I'm sorry. I'm really sorry. I don't want to see him. Come on, that's enough. It's over. I don't know, put it down there. Get the hell out of here, Jan. Put that here, that's fine. Just put it in front of the house. Stop it! - Come on, calm down! Cool it. Calm down. What do you think you're doing? Finish unloading. I'm really sorry. Really sorry. Pascale, that's enough. It'll be alright. I'm so ashamed, Didier. - There's no need. It'll be alright. Let's finish up. We'll be off, then. I'm sorry. So sorry. - It doesn't matter. Jan, don't stay here... Where are the keys? - In the ignition. Don't stay here. It's not doing any good. Thanks for everything. - Ciao. Stephan, you can... - Let's go. I'll take you to the station. We'll take you. Come with us. - Come on, Jan. It's for the best. It's over. - We'll have a coffee, talk things over. For heaven's sake, Jan... If there's any trouble, give us a ring. It's alright. Don't worry, we'll take care of it. Ciao. Yes, it's at Be... Bre... Becharprez. Becharprez, number 1. In Grand-Halleux. Yes, if you could send somebody, or a team, round. Right, thank you. Goodbye. They say they'll send somebody round. What are you going on about? - Bippety boo. That's silly. How many tadpoles will live? Here? - Yes. I don't know. How many do you think there are? I don't know. - How many do you think? It would take years to count them. But if it takes years, they'll already be toads and frogs, and they'll already be dead... I think there are so many that not many of them will survive. No, it's not possible. - You see. What if they all survived? All of them? Then there'd be... There wouldn't be enough room in the meadow. Nobody in. - No? Have you seen the motorbikes? - Yes. Are you going round the back? - Yes. Hey, a dead frog! You didn't... What... We were touching it. The way he said that... We'll get it out. Wait. You're not going to... Go on! Wait. Are you alright? Hey, Thomas, are you alright? - Only joking. Don't ever do that again. I don't believe it. Let's throw him out. Hey, what's going on here? What's that baddie doing? I'm going to catch you. What? I'm going to... rip it off... Stop that. - No! Let go of him. Stop it. - No, let go of me! Let go! Let go! Thomas, stay here. No! Let go! - No. Stop it, Jan! - There! Daddy, daddy, daddy! Thomas, it's going to be alright. - Daddy! Daddy... There now, there now. Calm down. Why did you throw him out? I want him to stay! Time for bed, Thomas. No! - Thomas, please. It's time to go to sleep. - No, I don't want to. Come with me. Come on. - No. Come with me. - No. You're tired. No! - Stop shouting. Do you still want to stay? Yes. Really? I've had enough. Thomas! Hey! Little rat! Hey, little rat. Daddy? I'm coming. How? How are you going to come, sweetheart? Get the ladder. - The ladder... Come on, jump. Are you alright? Listen, sweetheart, in fact, I've come to say goodbye. I'm going away. What about me? - You? You have to stay. Somebody has to look after mummy. I don't want you to go. Neither do I. But I think it's better that way. Why? I'm tired, kiddo. - Tired? Yes, tired. Are you tired, too? - A little bit. Come here. It could be a while before I see you again. Are you going on holiday? I'm going on holiday too. - Are you? First I'm going on holiday to Spain, with mummy and Didier. Then I come back. I'm going to visit Saint-Nicolas. Then I come home and I'll wait for you at the door, until you come back. You'd better not. I'd prefer you to grow into a big rat! Why don't you want me to come? Because... I don't want you to come with me because... it's too far. Further than Spain? Much further. It's cold. Come here. Are you leaving on a plane? Yeah. I think so. I think I'll fly. I want to fly too. Me too. You want to fly, do you? Come on then, climb aboard. Help! Thomas? Where's Thomas? My arms are hurting! Stop it. Are you alright? Thomas! Go on, go on. Go on. - No, I want you to stay with me. No, go on. - No, take me with you. Go to mummy. Go now! Go to mummy! Go on. - No. Go on, now. - Thomas! You must go! - With you. Take me with you. Come on, come on.
