In 1917, I enlisted to fight the Huns in France. Good men died around my back. And I saw no reason for it. The rules we followed were lies. And they did not apply to those who created them. I swore that if I returned home, I would never follow orders again. Part as soldier. I came home as an outlaw. He lived from one assault to another. A good day was spent sleeping. And a good night was spent running without looking back. I lived this life for 10 years. Until that set me up. It all started with an accomplice. LIVING AT NIGHT Albert White's side was playing high stakes poker And our accomplice left the back door open. Three two one. Give us the fucking money. - Do you know who owns this? - Get in here! Do you know who this game is, asshole of lightning? "Have you ever heard of Albert White?" - Keep talking. Girl, come here! Would you like a drink to accompany the robbery? No. Just the money. Put it in the bag. Come on. In the bag. With style. What is your name? Emma Gould. And yours? - Are you going to stick a sock in my mouth? "That's right. A sock? In the mouth? It was never used and I would not lie to you. That's what liars say. Quick, open it. Just a quick... Attention to this type. That's right. Put your fucking hands on the table. Great. All right, boys. Let's go. You really have tomatoes. Slow down. Do not drive as if we had done something. Calm. We did well. It was a good blow. Yeah, it's all mine. Yes. It can live. - Yes, lightning Irish. - Stop it. Drive. Good afternoon. I 'm Albert White. You must be Joe. Coughlin. It is good to associate a face with the name. This is Brennan Loomis, a friend of mine. How are you doing? You're too smart for what you're up to. To steal trifles with two Italian fools. They are your friends, but those caramanos are stupid. And they will not reach 40 years. Take the time you want. But you can not work on yourself. Not in this city. Albert was gathering the troops. There was a war over rum. Dermot, give him a word. Albert White Leads Irish Mafia... Brennan, keep an eye on him. ... and the Masc Pescatore Iiderava the Italians. It was an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth. The deadliest year in Boston's history. White's crew set fire to rum trucks. Then a guy from Masc Went home with a girl that no one had ever seen. There was no winner. Just a lot of confusion. I wanted nothing to do with Albert White and his war. But he had no choice. His girlfriend was my accomplice. And I was in love with her. He would kill her if she tried to leave him. And he would kill us two times in a row if he knew we were together. But we were in love and we were stupid. And whenever he was out of town, we were together. We fit perfectly. Revenge on me when I least expect it. - You're just saying nonsense. - Do not say anything. I know what you like to hear, I'm not stupid. Like the back of your hand. Can I keep you company? Sorry, old man, we're waiting for a person. Do not. Emma, this is my father. Tom Coughlin. Dad, this is my friend Emma Gould. Good to meet you, Miss Gould. Can I sit down? Where are you from, Miss Gould? From Dorchester. No, before that. It's obvious that she's Irish. My whole family is from Cork. Seriously? What is her maiden name? Do not know. Do not know? She died. My mother is dead, so... So, what does it do? This restaurant is really dude, is not it? I know how my son earns his living. I assume that if you came in contact with him, It was during a crime Or an establishment full of fringe. Do my questions make you embarrassed? I do not know what you're talking about. And to be honest, I do not care. I'm saying that's the kind of girl you run into with criminals. The fact that the criminal is my son is not in question. The point is he's my son. And I have feelings that lead me To question the wisdom of having a type of woman Which is done consciously with criminals. - You got it? - Enough, father. It's ok? My uncle told me about a policeman he paid for, called Coughlin. And you? Is your uncle your name Robert? And everyone knows him for Bobo? No, the police you're referring to are EImore Conklin. It is in Savin Hill. He receives payments from illegal establishments such as Bobo's. I rarely go to Dorchester. Still, as deputy superintendent, I'll be happy to be interested in Bobo. I'll do the makeup again. Was that necessary? I did not start it, Joseph. Do not criticize me for how I ended up. I've been a police officer for 37 years. And I learned, above all, one thing. Do you know what it is? Is it going to be a long story about the old homeland? Do not. What you give to the world always comes back to you. But never as predicted. I'm sure not. Undeserved trust in what we ignore Always has the brightest brightness. I think I deserved enough. She is quite beautiful. Yes it is. Other than that, I do not understand what you see in it. Why is it from Dorchester? That does not help. Her father is a pimp. The uncle killed two men. But I could turn a blind eye to it, Joseph, if she... She does not pretend to be something she is not. Maybe she's just asleep. Thank you for coming. You should get into his bed tonight. what? He looks at me like I'm trash. We are not people. We are just the Goulds of Dorchester. We make the lace for your cursed curtains. Heaven! You know that... Do not you dare touch me. All my life I have been looked down upon with arrogance, By people like your father. We are no less than you. I never said they were. But he said. Fuck that, okay? I love you. You think love is so simple. Can be. Heaven. - Come here. - I do not want. - Leave me alone. - Am sorry. Am sorry. I want to leave. - It's ok. It's ok. Can I have two pennies? Thanks. FACTS MADE TO MEASURE Joe Coughlin. I was invited. Put your arms around like this. I have to search him. You may come in. Joseph? Joe Coughlin. Yes. Much like it. Do you know who I am? I know enough to come when they call me. My name is Maso Pescatore. Control the North End And the alcoholic beverages that come from Florida. I'm a man With the lives of other men in my hands. But the truth is That I am a simple carcamano of the old homeland. Today, my only rival It's Albert White. When it ceases to be, We will see the end of the struggles that devastate this city. I have nothing against you. But I'm not involved with gangsters. Not with a seducer like you. You make small robberies and assaults, But you're not a gangster. "So, what are you?" - Do not know. One out-of-there, I guess. I do not want to get into this life. How many things, good and bad, come to us, Whether we want them or not? For example, One of my men saw you with a young lady. It was not quite a lady, but a maverick puttana Involved with Albert White. So it does not matter what you want anymore. You're in this life. And this can only end in two ways. First, You get to Albert and kill him. Monday, I tell Albert about the girl. And he kills you first. As I said, I'm not a gangster. I've killed enough in this life. Want to tell a rumor to your enemy? Make yourself comfortable. If I kill Albert White, Someone will come to take his place. And I'll be stuck with the Pescatore mafia for the rest of my life. I stopped kissing hands for a long time. Good afternoon. Do you think he told Albert? No. I'd already be dead. Creed. We could leave. Where would we go? To a hot spot. My brother Danny lives in California. At where? Do not know. I have not spoken to him in 10 years. He sent postcards to say that he was working as a double And trying to be a writer. I was going to California. But I do not know much about honest work. "Who said anything about honest work?" - Great. No, we do whatever we want. We'll go wherever we want. We will sleep during the day. I have a job in Lawrence on Saturday. Then I'm free. Free to leave? Yes. Free to leave. I have to go and see you-know-who on Saturday. - Fuck you. - That 's the idea. Come on. What is the alternative? You want me to go to the Charles River? I'm going to meet Statler with him on Saturday. It excites him to see me when he has the woman next to him. Then he's going to Detroit for a week. Do you think you can get on the Statler at 19:00? I think I can get by and be at the Statler at 7:00. Shut up! The assault on Lawrence's bank would allow us to go to California. That's right, that's what I thought. Let's go. LAWRENCE CITY BANK What are you doing? The cops! Watch out! Rays! Out of the way! - Rays! - Shit! Get out of the fucking front! Bófia! - Come on. - Go! Get in the car! Go! POLICE Shit! I walked almost a mile, stole a car in North Reading And replaces it with a Dodge I found in Somerville. I returned to my childhood home and pondered the alternatives. MASSACRATED POLICE The story appeared in all the evening editions. The third police officer killed was state police And sent someone to a stop near the forest. It had to be Dion. PRESS - To be continued. - There is a service elevator. I can not believe you came! - What could I do? - To run away. - Where? - Do not know. And what people do. I do not do this. Come on. Shit! Why are you crying? Because I love you. Then smile. I can not. Do not. Of course, as you die, You will tell yourself that you did it out of love. Do not. You feel guilty about what you do And you spend your life waiting to be punished for your sins. Good Here I am. Joe, I'm so sorry. She regrets. We all lament. Get her out of here. You said you did not kill him. Albert, that was the deal! - Do not worry. "I would never have brought you here..." You think I'm going to be humiliated by a whore? Came to me And they said that a fool is putting horns on me. You're lucky you did not cut your tits and toss you into a bin. Take her to the car, Donnie. - No! Joe, I'm sorry! Albert, do not kill her. You should be more worried about what I'm going to do to you. Albert, do not kill her. What the hell do you care? She just betrayed you. Please. I was not sincere. She said if she gave you up, I would not kill you. But we both know I have to kill you, do not we, Joe? And then. I'm going to kill her too. Let him stay. Let's get out of here. Now you're a cop, Joseph? I did not kill anyone. Your friends were going to take you on your last trip. Dad, they're gonna kill her. We will not kill you, Joseph. But some of my colleagues want to talk to you. Listen, please. Father! They're going to kill her. She's in the car with Donnie Gishler. Do not know what material is his skull, but not is bone. Two weeks in a coma. There is no cranial bleeding, no loss of memory or speech. It has the nose and half of the ribs split. It will take time to stop urinating blood. You may come in. Dad, where is she? Did you find her? I followed her and Donnie Gishler. His car pulled off the road and fell to the sea at 21:20. Beverly's agent dived for them. He was in hospital for a week with hypothermia. She was Albert White's girlfriend. He betrayed you. Yes, he betrayed. And then? I'm crazy about her. Madness is not love. I watched your marriage for 18 years. It was not love. Do not. Was not. Anyway, she died. She's as dead as your mother. God has it. They caught Paul in St. Albans, about 10 miles from the border. Several agents chased him. He was hit by at least 14 shots. It's little for a cop killer. What about Dion? It is possible that you have reached the border. You were the son who should shorten the distance between me and your mother. Did you know that? I knew the distance. People do not heal each other. And they never cease to be what they have always been. Sometimes we have some luck. Do not waste your luck mourning her death. We create our luck. Sometimes. At other times, it is she who creates us. If he finds himself guilty, I shot the death penalty of the equation. Three years of effective sentence and 20 years of probation. Three years? Three policemen died. And he did not kill them. He may be the son of a deputy superintendent, But you'll know the interior of the Charlestown prison well, believe me. Chief Inspector, I was demoted yesterday. So we can put that question aside. I have no illusions. I'm a practical man. The photograph is of a door of a semi-detached house in Back Bay, Where he has spent some time with a young man of Mexican descent. If you change the location of your relationships, I'll know in an hour. I'll see what I can do. This has little interest to me. I gave myself as guilty of complicity in an armed robbery And I was sentenced to three years and four months in the prison of Charlestown. If my father had lived another two weeks, I could have been fired. I had a guaranteed life And he was going to live it. I would use the Masc and his hatred for Albert to begin. It's funny how things change. What happened to the conversation about not being a gangster? Now you come looking for work. I have nothing else. I do not want to be a gangster. But I work for an if so get to Albert White. From what I learned in prison, He's still the right man for it. We banished Albert White from Boston, as you know. Now he is trying to attack the rum operation in Central Florida. He wants Tampa. It's true, I could get somebody Committed to ending Mr. White. So, I'm the right man. Your duty should always be First with the Pescatore family and then with you. Do you accept that? It seems fair to me. I just need one guy, Dion Bartolo, from my old group Help me handle it. It's good to have someone you trust. There, it is very hot. This does not bother me. You never felt such heat. I spent some winters in Charlestown. I like the change. And he puts the narcotics around. Starting with Tampa. Frank Ormino heads for Tampa. He will decide that he does not want headaches. When will you decide that? Ten minutes after you get there. I see. "Will we be equal partners?" - No. Frank Ormino is an equal partner. But think about what will happen to you. I think it works cheap. Can you tolerate an Irishman on your side? We're in America. I've had to put up with worse. I realized that it is not enough to break the rules. We must be strong enough to create our rules. Hello! Joseph! Such as? - Look at you. - It's for you! I'm sorry about your father. And I for your brother. Thank you. Listen, When Lefty Downer met me in Montreal And told me that the Pescatore wanted me to work for them, I thought it was bullshit. I thought later That if one can deceive the devil is my former partner. - Look at this. - Fuck you! Do you look at me for this? First you. Stop fucking. I work for you now. Chief Joe Coughlin. Under the seat you find a friend. Welcome to Ybor, the Harlem of Tampa. Cigars built it. What are you smelling? They are probably cakes or empanadas. The rest of Tampa leaves Ybor alone. To them, we are a date of stupid Hispanics and carcamanos And we can do whatever we want if we leave them in peace. It was to be believed that we all had a good time, But that's not what happened. The Italians and the Cubans do not give themselves. But Cubans hate Hispanics And Hispanics find Cubans an arrogant half-breed Who forgot who they were when they were released in 1898. Cubans and Hispanics despise Puerto Ricans And everyone, even all, shit for the Dominicans. The Italians only respect you if you came on the boat. How are you, ladies? And whites think we care about them. You're a workaholic here. DOCTOR'S OFFICE The port of Tampa. COLLECTION AND SHIPPING TERMINAL SUL Who is it? Fireplace. Thank you, JT. Good job. There is a network of tunnels so under the city. "Who owns this warehouse?" - It was Frank Ormino. What do you mean, "was"? Ormino has had some holes for days. Was fast. See this. The best there is! It has to be about 85 degrees Celsius. Yes, these babies never lie. We do not want people to die when they drink this. We made lots of drinks in the prison toilet. It seems like two essential ingredients are missing. - Which are? - People and molasses. Yes, we have a problem. - What? - Our distributor. He has not brought anything. What is the problem? The boats have sunk. - What's his name? - Gary L. Smith. - Gary EIIsmith. - No. Gary L. Smith. In the middle, it's an initial. Do not know. He wants them to use it. And something of the southerners. Is not it just for being an idiot? Both. Thank you, Girl Roe. It must be Maso's new discovery. Something of the sort. - How are you doing? - Good. What brings you here? I was asked to take over the affairs of Frank Ormino. I hope it's not permanent. - No offense. "You did not offend me. Because? People like to deal with acquaintances. And nobody knows him. I see. So, who suggests? I have no ambitions, But to maintain continuity, I would do this for some time. We are concerned about the attack on the last three supplies. It was the Cubans. Why not go to a new supplier? "It's not that simple." "Why not?" Because everyone pays tribute to the Suarez family. It's the Cubans who have the club in 7th, right? Let's also talk to them. You do not realize how things are done here. I'll deal with Mr. Suarez And with his sister. We're arranging a meeting for tomorrow night, about 9:00. Great. Now, Gary L., tell me this. Do you work directly for Albert White? Or is there some intermediary I should know? what? We marked your bottles. what? We marked what was distilled here. And all the shipments that have been lost in the sea Somehow reached the clandestine bars of Albert White. Can you explain that? No. I do not understand. Dion showed me his house on the way here. It has a beautiful house. You gotta pack that shit up to send it anywhere. Where I go? Are you fucking her? What? Who? - Girl Roe. - What? - He's fucking her. - No doubt. - That's right. - Come on. A siesta with Little Girl Roe. Sweetness in the morning Sweetness in the... I do not care who fucks. You have tickets here. It's for the Seaboard train at 11 PM today. I do not care who it takes, but you have to go on that train. Wait, gentlemen. - Wait there. - We can do it another way. I can hit you with my head on the floor like a bowling ball. But let's make this easy. Get on the train, Gary L. Or we'll have to shove it under him. Listen, I think... We could... Come on, folks. Gentlemen, we can... Let's talk a little more. This is... Mr. Co... FRANCIS ORMINO DEAD TO POLICE SHOT SEARCH FOR WITNESSES Girl Roe! When did you mark the bottles? What the hell are you talking about? You've always been with me. Did you see me tag bottles? No! I saw that it was a lie. Dion Bartolo. Yes for sure. This way. Mr. Esteban is waiting for you. Mr. Suarez, it's good to see you. Allow me to introduce you to Joe Coughlin. - It's a pleasure to meet you. - Equally. Drink something. Thank you very much. I never agree with Hispanics that lighter runs are better. Of course, we Cubans align Because of our obsession that the clearer the better, in everything. Dion, Joseph, my sister, Graciela. - Very good. - We have already met. My mistake. Of course we know. Yes, we do. How are you doing? Hi how are you? Much like it. God, this rum is fantastic. It would be good if we could sell it in the north. When your country treats you as adults. There is no rush. We would be out of work. It was Esteban who took them. - The working people of Miami. - Very well. It's a hobby. Maybe I'll photograph it one of these days, Mr. Coughlin. Do not know. The fewer photos of me, the better. I agree with the Indians on that. Speaking of captive souls, They told me That Mr. Gary L. Smith was seen joining Seaboard Limited, With his wife in a luxury carriage And that master bitch in another. Never know. Sometimes we need to change the scenery. Is that why you're here in Ybor? To change scenery? I'm here to distill and distribute illegal rum. A difficult task for your erratic imports. We do not control the sea. The sea is good from here to Miami. We know nothing of the boats for Miami. Sir, Famosa assures me that the sea has been calm. Mentioned the Lord Famous To think that we can steal the routes. Do not. I mentioned the Señor Famous to assure you Who, from now on, can work directly with me And can charge me a higher value. "What do we get in return?" - Access To the policemen and judges of the Ormino, now controlled by us. Most would not want anything to do with you because you're Cuban. And you want exclusive access to our molasses? No. You just can not sell it to White. He's a paying customer. We never had any problems with him. I know Albert White. I thought you would rather deal with someone who treats you as human beings. This may cause bloodshed. It sure will. These are very advantageous conditions. We received Albert White. The local sheriff wanted to talk to us. Apparently it was customary there Talk about how we would break the law before we did it. What kind of man is the boss? It's a cop. So it's stupid. Other than that, not bad. What are you doing? Do not touch things like that. The sheriff arrives and sees a werecat playing his papers. This is Figgis. Please sit down. I will not insult you And ask the nature of your business. So you will not have to insult me and lie to me. You think it's fair? It seems fair to me. Is it true that you are the son of a police captain? Yes sir. Fought abroad? On France. Long live the Marines. Yes sir. And so it was. I was a soldier and then U.S. Marshal. I have killed seven men in my life. Truth be told, Their faces haunt me almost every night. Keep the business north of the 2nd, South of 27th And east of Nebraska And we will have few reasons for discord. Sounds good to me. I know we live in a rotten world, But it's because I breathe corrupted air And I live with corrupt men, Never make the mistake of thinking That I am corruptible. I will not make that mistake. Very well. Heaven. Sorry. I thought you were alone. That's all right, Loretta. These gentlemen were on their way out. Honey, your manners. Yes father. Girl Loretta Figgis. I like it very much, girl. I 'm Joe Coughlin. Dion Bartolo. Loretta will start a long train ride today. It is fashionable. - California. - Really? She's going to be a star in Hollywood. - It's just a test, Dad. - No. An agent came here. And chose some girls. My brother is there. Is your brother in Hollywood? As far as I know, is double. It falls from the horses. It was a taste, girl. Boss. Gentlemen. "Do not you really want a banana?" - No thank you. "No fruit in Boston." - I know. Looks good. what is it? There she is. - See this. - Yes? Hello good afternoon. - How are you doing? "Good. And you?" Excellent. The girl and her brother have already decided... Not yet. We are still pondering. It's ok. It would be a great change for us. I understand. Of course. It is not easy to change. There are several types of changes. Where I've been staying, We played a lot xad rez And this is the kind of change in which you take your pawn to the bottom of the board And he becomes a queen. There is not much to ponder. - I play chess. 11093; Yes. My father taught me. Perhaps you should remember that the pawn and the king They go to the same place at the end of the game. At the end? It is not the end. This is the game. You can even catch fire at the end. I want to win during the game. It tickles me that wins most games. Not yet, but I intend to win. Why do not you keep me company? Some say drinks are just a side business. Seriously? In fact, I've heard rumors that they give most of your money. Much of it for Cuba. And you think it's stupid? Stupid, no. But it's not my cause, that's all. And what is your cause? The distribution of illegal rum. And that no man should command in the life of another. If you control the rum market, you will be a king. I still have to deal with Albert White. But how will you retain power after conquering it? Because? Do not you think I'm strong enough? I do not know if it's cruel enough. And if it is, I will be very sad Powerful men do not have to be cruel. But usually they are. Tell me something. Do you think there are noble men? I have nothing against noble men. But, rarely, they pass the 40 years. My father died for Cuba. My mother died heartbroken. He used to say to me and Stephen: "One does not truly live "If there is not something for which he would die." He seems to have been a good man. And was. We will never be lovers. No? Because? We will not be lovers. We conquered the rum market and lived like kings. You know what? Very well. Come on, hurry up. The banks went into crisis. Jobs were scarce. But addiction, it seemed that was to the proof of Depression. All right, come on. The Suarez-Coughlin partnership created rare stability. We bribed Albert's types in Central Florida To lower their weapons. When Albert wanted to attack us, he had to use Miami guys. And when they appeared, we surprised them. Albert was on the run in Miami And there was not a bar in Central or North Florida where we did not sell. Go get something inside and turn off this shit. It's ok. For the ground! Down to the ground, now! For the ground. Already! For the ground! This is what happens When Catholics try to sell alcohol here. The type name is RD Pruitt. We'd better go looking for him. He is part of the KIan. And then? So are five million types. The Klan has a lot of influence. They are late only with the fourth class. They'll love you. A Catholic who works with blacks and lives with a Cuban. The biggest problem is the RD brother-in-law. Who is he? Chief Figgis. Joe Coughlin. I do not shake hands with papists. No offense. It did not offend me. Would it help if I told you that I have not been in a church for years? Very well. RD. Realize you're causing trouble in Ybor. As well? We heard you're assaulting places. I do not know anything about that. I'm just kidding. You know. RD. He is a business man who came to deal with business. I suggest you talk to him. This man sells illegal alcohol. And fornicates with blacks. It has to be covered with tar and feathers. I will not do business with him. I'm just kidding! Hold a joke, right? Of course I can. As long as it does not become a joke, right? You like Parisian, right? What if I like it? Maybe you can give him 10% of the house's revenue. - Would do it? - Would make. Good. I should be worth more than 10%. What were you thinking? In 60. 60%? The biggest club in town? That's right. For what, exactly? My friends could see him with better eyes. What friends? 60%. Son, I'm not giving you 60%. I'm not your son. I'm not nobody's son. It saves the embarrassment to your father. - What? -15%. I beat him to death. Excuse me? You know, Seems like a fair deal to me. Would you go up to 20? I think 15 is pretty good for doing nothing. Good. It's a fair deal And please accept me. How do I get my share? Pass the Parisian. On the second Tuesday of the month, at 7:00 p.m. It was a pleasure, Mr. Coughlin. Irv. Looks like we have a deal. The guy is stupid like a door. I do not understand what Maso wants. The arrests fell 70% And revenues rose 300%. I do not like you sending a kid over here to supervise us. No! We do not need supervision. Digger wants to review the casino option and check progress. Only that. He's going to inform the old man. It's nothing special. Do not exaggerate. Maso will listen to what his son tells him about a new casino. Do not worry. Why did they call it "Digger"? Because he's an idiot. They only let him dig ditches for the corpses they kill. - Seriously? - Yes. That's great. I outlined a plan to invest in a casino With shareholders in Sarasota, At the development site of the new Ritz. The Ritz Hotel and Casino. Top. Excellent. ... to the casino. A top resort. An extraordinary experience, whether you like it or not. Such a violent branch Was surprisingly full of guys who just wanted to put food on the table. Digger was not one of those guys. Is here. The Volstead Law will not last forever, right? What are we going to do when Dry Law ends? Play. We use our contacts to check it out. And we are the only ones in a position to manage it. On here? It will be. Ritz Longboat Key. I spoke with the owners last week in Sarasota. Why did they let us in? They can not legalize the game and can not manage a casino. They are the owners and we run the casino. We split the profits into socks. Hold on. Do we have any magic wand that changes the laws? Hear that they have cleared the bingo. It is a step, a prerequisite. We have to do something. -and then... - I know. It was a prerequisite. Your grandmother can come and play in the church. Bingo! I've got people bribing inspectors in Tallahassee and Sarasota. I have types on top of Senators and Finance inspectors who play. If we check the game, We get rich. Legally. Long-term. I also have a lot of good news. But I like you. He's a very smart boy. Masc was crazy about the casino. He would call every day, as if the idea were his. It was addressed to "Sir Joseph Coughlin, Black Fucker." Inside, a note that read: "Sixty percent." Same note. The same message. We're doing what we can, but he's protected. His roots here are too deep. It's time to start digging. Good afternoon, gentlemen. Virgil Beauregard. How can I help you today? We hope you will persuade RD Pruitt to win. Not much can do that. We would try. Why? His self-preservation. He has to stop attacking my clubs. Clubs? What kind of clubs? Bridge? Because I belong to the Greater Tampa Rotary Club And I do not remember seeing him. I've come to talk business with you. And you want to play? "Is that what I want to do?" - Listen, Is the Great Wizard of Ku KIux Klan around here. Congratulations. But you think we've come this far To let some late cocksuckers press us? If you think we are, you're making a fatal mistake, son. We are clerks, bankers, Police officers, delegates and... We even have a judge. And if he's stupid enough to fight us, Let's fall on top of each other. And of all that he loves. Are you threatening me with people who are more powerful than you? Exactly. What the hell am I talking to you about? Came to my house. I decided to spare you the trouble of picking me up. 75 witnesses. None want to talk. Do you want a beer? It's non-alcoholic beer, but it's not bad. I'd love to. Thank you. I need DR, boss. I already expected you to say that. You know what happens if you do not help me. No, I do not know. There will be more corpses. More articles will be written such as "Cigar City Massacre". And the boss will be away. And Joe, too. Perhaps. The difference is that when you are away, Someone will put a bullet through your head. I will not betray my wife's brother. I do not want to do this. Do what? I do not want to do what I'm forced to do. I do not force you to do anything. Yes, it does. what? She did not make it to Hollywood. He stayed in Los Angeles. It can not be. Now you have a special doctor. She is fine. What kind of doctor? Kind of freeing people from heroin, Irv. Never treat me by my baptismal name. Treat me to Chief Figgis As long as we have to deal with each other, be it days or years. Do we have a deal? I did not do this to you. Tell Your Price To tell me where my daughter is. She is in a clean and safe institution. And I will not tell her where she is until... Up until? RD, you're going to talk to the boy again. And there is nothing more to discuss. Yes, it will be just us two. On Longboat Key, Next to the Ritz. Tonight, at 10:00 p.m. When will I know where she is? As soon as I leave this encounter with life. Do it yourself. what? If you're going to kill him, Be a little man and pull the trigger. It is not worthy to have others do what they fear to do personally. It's ok. As for me, it is not difficult to pull a trigger. Hello, RD. Where is my brother-in-law? He did not come. Guys. This is sly. If you take your eyes off that weapon, Believe him he shoots. It's not likely. Are you a man of your word? It depends on who I give it to. Did not you come alone, as I told you? Dammit, RD, that would ruin the fun. Where are they? I knew this could be the biggest casino in the United States When the Dry Law ends? The Dry Law will not end in a God-fearing country. The country is crawling. Banks are sinking and cities are bankrupt. Because we have a Communist president. Because there are no taxes on alcoholic beverages. That is why the state will change the laws to legalize the game. It can be a part of that. I do not want to be part of anything with you. How much does he pay you? Who? Albert White. How much does he pay you to attack my bars? He's doing a hell of a job for him. Yes, I accepted his Catholic money. Know why? Because I would do it for free. You're a pest. You, you black whore And your filthy caramanian friends. I'm going to take over the Parisian. I do not want 60%. I want everything. I'll control all your clubs. I'll take everything you got. Maybe I'll even go by your house. And tear that whole black before he cut his throat. You still did not realize, But you're leaving town, boy. You just forgot to pack. It's ok. Now. Rays. Shit. Shit. Get the car. It's ok. - Let's get you to a doctor. - Rays. It hurts. Yes. It hurts, but it will not kill you. - Shit. - Right there. Shit. Rays. We should not have shown him the photos. What pictures? To Figgis. We had to do this to get this bastard. The price was too high. I think it was you who targeted me. - What? - I killed him before he fired. - It was not me. "It could not have been anyone else. - Fasani was behind. - It was him. No, the Fasani came from there. - Fasani came from here. - I was back there. It came from this angle, like this. I was here. - I killed these bastards. - You got me! - Bring more but the fucking car. - It's ok. It will be an excellent casino. - Right? - Yes. Albert was paying the DR to attack us. But when we killed members of the Klan, The Klan took it to heart. They wanted to kill me in the hospital, but we had guards on the door. When the men of the Klan left, Dion had them followed. The subsequent succession of beatings, bombings and homicides Ended the power of the KKK in Tampa. - How do you feel? - I am fine. These? Thank you. There will never be another. Irv's wife left and took her son with her. No one saw Loretta for the rest of the season. Can I have your name? Do you want to marry? what? We're married, are not we? Graciela Isabella... I do not remember them all. Monday tuesday "Stupid I do not have so many names. - Waiting. Graciela Coughlin. You're the best thing that ever happened to that name. I bought buildings. Do we get married and suddenly buy buildings? Yes. I bought three from the Perez factory. What are you going to do with them? I want to shelter abandoned women and children. It's important, Joe. What happened to the cause of Cuban politics? I fall in love with you. You limit my mobility. Come here. I love you. After months of imprisonment, Loretta left the house and declared that she would only wear white. A decision made for her by Jesus Christ, With whom I was now married. It's a terrible business. Her sermons were a success. And her vision for Tampa, clean of sin, It did not include a casino. What is the problem with this preacher? There's no problem. Everything will work out. Nothing can jeopardize the casino business. Of course, Maso. I agree to 100%. Do whatever it takes. I'm going to talk to her. I'll do whatever it takes, okay? Make sure that the problem disappears. I do not want to hear anything else. It's ok. Thank you very much. You do not have to listen hidden. Ask me anything you want about the deal. And I'll tell you. It's your business, it's not mine. But it will be. I'll tell you everything you want to know. Yes. When I came here, I just thought To take revenge and make money. Now, everything I do, every step I take It is for both of us and to protect our future. You have to understand that. But if these steps make you, Little by little, another person, You will cease to be you. It's you, except for the bad things you did. It's almost you. I want you. And you have me. You got me. Come here. You have me. REPENT YOURSELF ABOUT GOD The game destroys the spirit. Amen. WHERE WILL ETERNITY PASS? We heard a lot Of personal freedom. But when we saw the barbarity of man And we were her targets... We realized Which is simply freedom for the player. For him to waste the Lord's gifts, Using them for themselves. Amen. The personal freedom It's freedom Of a murderer. From a seducer! A wolf Who wants to remain in the midst of the sheep. I ask you, Is your virtue cheap? - No! No it's cheap! "It's not cheap." Is your virtue cheap? No, it's not! My virtue has always been very cheap. What virtue? And they intend to build a game den On our fringe! No! But we condescend. There is only one way to solve this. With her nearby, the casino will not be approved. If the casino is not approved, -We are both plotted. - I'll handle this, okay? - Mr. Coughlin! - Girl Figgis. What a pleasure. Thank you very much for receiving us. Excellent sermon. - Excellent. - Fantastic You know my father. Boss. And this is Mayweather. He will take the good news and preach it in the south. Pleasure, sir. It's my pleasure. How nice. You have to hear this in Miami. - Do a good job. - I'll try. Great. How can I help you? I wanted to talk to you for a moment. I hoped I could Talk a little about the Ritz. My dad says he was a good man. I did not know it was not any more. You do a lot for the people here. But we both know that his good works are mitigated For their wicked deeds. Do we know? Profit from the addictions of others. With weakness, laziness, and idiotic behavior. But you can get rid of it. I do not want. Of course you do. Girl Figgis, you're a lovely woman. And your story is fantastic. No wonder your herd has tripled. It has increased fourfold. Never have so many drinks been consumed as in the past ten years. People do not want to be banned from drinking. The same applies to fornication. People want her And they do not want you to forbid them to do so. Nor should they forbid. Excuse me? If people want to fornicate, why would they stop them? What if they want to do it with animals? Do you? Excuse me? Do you want to do it with animals? Some want it. If it carries on, the disease will spread. I do not understand the relationship between alcohol and fornication with animals. All sins are intertwined. They are all against the will of God And, as such, equally offensive. I apologize. I think we started bad. I just came to ask you Would be willing to omit The casino issue of your sermons And, in return, We brought a business here. This will create jobs, Which will reduce sins Associated with poverty and inactivity. We could contribute to the church. Hell, we even built some churches. If God rewrite the Bible to consider the game virtuous, I will stop talking about it. But until then. We can not choose our sins, Mr. Coughlin. I can not do it. what? She's going to end this shit. Can not you do it? I know. No one touches you. This is a mistake. Whom you say. You want something to drink? We are fine thanks. We know they are busy and we do not want to waste time. Let's not invest in the casino at the Ritz. Are you sure? Am sorry. There is too much publicity. A woman who preaches in the light of a tent? Yes, because the casino would represent only 2% of our shares. And we can not seem to be a company of Irish and Italian Catholics Which turn Protestant girls into drug addicts. The people I work for will be very angry. We will not be pressured or deceived. We are an institution. We can not be bribed or attacked, Because I just represent the veiled interest Of an administration. We are the lords with lands of this country. We do not intend to give up part of the country Which cost us immense taming and colonizing To give it to Catholics, Jews, OR carcamanos. It's just a bigger and better scheme. Only that. Keep the money in your hands and out of the hands of people like us. All these people, OS neg POS, On whose back marked the submission of this country, And the immigrants who came here with nothing And worked endlessly, Believed when they were told they could succeed. And one day, perhaps no longer in my time, They will realize this. But I'll tell you what. I'd hate to be you. Among those people And What they deserve. Good luck to you. Idiot! It would have been a fantastic casino. You'll get another chance. Things come and go. Not all. Announced on the radio when we got back. President-elect Roosevelt vowed to sign the Cullen-Harrison Act as soon as he was elected, ending Dry Law . - Hello, Girl Figgis. - Mr. Coughlin. - Can I ? - Yes . - Just a little? - Please sit down. You look very good. I see you're not dressed in white. It's almost white. Want a menu? Thank you very much. Can I have some coffee, please? Of course. Thank you. Why does my country hate so much? I'm a bad guy and he's the police chief. Things are like this. No. He liked you. He said you were Ybor's eldest. Did he say that? What did you do? To him? We had photos. And he showed them. I showed her two. How many? All. Let's all go to hell. I do not think Loretta is going to hell. You know what I learned While I've been To surrender my soul to God? what? This is a paradise. Right here. We are in it now. So, why does it look like hell? Because we did shit. After my trials, I slept in my childhood bed. I felt safe again. I missed that. I do not know if God exists. But I hope so. And I hope you're kind. It would be fantastic, would not it? Yes would be. It does not seem to despair. Is there a secret? No. There are no secrets. I have my wife. That's enough. What if I lose it? What are you going to do now? As well? He caught me. Prevented the construction of the casino. Iei could not do it. People do not either. The Klan could not. It was Loretta. I did not eradicate alcoholic beverages. No. That was too much. But he stopped the game and, before him, was guaranteed. I did it, did not I? Yes it was. What's your dad going to do? To sit in his chair, I guess. Blind in anger Because men touched his daughter as he touched his wife. It's worse. He walks around the house whispering a word, over and over again. What word? Repent. Repent. Give it some time. Maybe it will. We heard from Boston. All three trucks arrived well. Same bribes as last week. No problem. Great. And Loretta Figgis cut her throat yesterday. what? Yes, they say they did it at home, in the boss's bed. I have to admit. She had the courage. I would not be able to. I do not know, some things are meant. Hell, I could have done it three months ago. And did us a favor. It's too late. DEATH OF A MADONNA Do you blame yourself? She went west like a lot of girls. It was targeted by predators. It was not you. It was men like me. Men who get drinks, girls... They get drugs. One hand washes the other. We are not responsible for others. In fact, it is insulting to think that we are. Look at these people. If this man die drunk, Is it our fault? When did you take this picture? A month ago. You are sure? I took this photo a month and three days ago. Why 7 Because that woman died in 1927. There's never been anyone like you in my life. And one day, I'll be good enough for you. Sure it is it? You tell me. Did you tell Graciela? Of course I did. Oh my God. Did not you tell your wife? Do not. I do not tell you anything. But you're dumber than me. What you said? "Sorry, honey, the girl I've cried for years "Is not dead. She's in Miami. "Do not make a scene." When are you going? - Where? - As well? You figured the girl you love is 320 km away. When are you going? Maybe after solving this with Maso. Great. You'll have something to live for. What does that mean? He and his people will occupy half the train. It's a big entourage. Fights. I'm not worried. He does not gain anything in killing us. We made 11.5 million a year with rum alone In the fucking city of this crap. Why would he kill us? We only sent him sacks of money to his mansion in Nahant. The signs do not please me. "What signs?" - We lost the casino. We have never advanced to narcotics. And you're Irish in a world full of Italians. You will enter a building that is all of it. I can not hide a weapon. Anything. You're going to go blind and stay out. Are they enough signs for you? I need you to do something for me. You're going to spend some time in Miami. How long? Do not know. Not much. I do not want to know your address. Give it to Dion. When the time comes, he tells me where you are. And I'll get you. To find out if you're as cruel as you have to be? I think so. Joseph. Even if you win this battle, there is so much violence in what you do. Come here. Gino, where do you live now? In Neponset. Did you get settled? Two children. A mugliera, 'a casa. Everything. Do you have kids? I do not have any. It's never the right time. This way. How are you, son? Good. Faust, see if Dion needs anything. How have you been? Good. And you? I have more good days than bad days. Great. Was this tart that spoiled the casino business? Yes, it was her. So why did not you kill her? There would be many problems. It was not because of it. You're not a killer, Joseph. You're a crook indeed. That's why you did not kill That puttana makes peace. Do you know how much money this gave before I got here? "How much do you give now?" - But it's just rum. You forgot the girls and the narcotics. I devoted myself to rum because it was more profitable And added four houses. Yes, but you could have added more. Maso, listen... Mr. Pescatore! I control Ybor and Tampa. Have you ever had problems? You did more than that. You controlled the whole coast. Isolaste the Albert. You put him in a corner of Miami. I've been looking at the books. You gave us strength here. But does agorajá not want the Irish? What can I be? What I tell you. Before you hit a fist in the mouth. You can be consigliere. Show Digger how this works, introduce you to people. Teach him to fish. But you have to take a cut. What kind of cut? Digger takes your share. Listen, Mr. Pescatore, I think it's a fantastic idea. Digger takes over here. Let's control Florida and conquer Cuba. But my part has to be more or less the same. There is no power in being a foreman and extorting the stevedores. Did you ever think that's the point, smartass? Need me. I built this. You would be useful to us. But I feel a certain lack of gratitude. Me too. You work for me. Not for the Hispanics or black people you live with. If I have you clean my fucking toilet, guess what you do? I can kill your girlfriend's whore And burn your house if I feel like it. Do you want to be the foreman? Or clean the shit out of my toilet? I accept applications for both functions. I think I'm the foreman. Beautiful boy. Do you want to have dinner tonight? We have some reserved places. You know what I like about Albert White, Joseph? what? Is that he also knows Tampa. That means no one needs you, you idiot. My luck has changed a bit. Me and Maso understand each other. When from this casino business cable, he asked me to help his son. And that was just the beginning. You know, You have to trust the people you work with. We did not go into it to stay second. To support the wrong horse. It is. Did you think you were going to eat tomorrow and see the sunshine? You were wrong. See you one last time, because you're going to die now. Hang on. Albert, I have something you want to see. If he did not see this, he would regret it for the rest of his life. He would never forgive himself. She is dead. Does it look dead to you? Where is she? It's in the picture, Albert. - Where is where is? - I loved to tell you. But he loved to get out of here alive. It is old. - It's an old photo. - That's what I thought. But notice the guy, in the corner, with the newspaper. It was last month. Tell me or I'll kill you. I loved you too, Albert. How do you love that woman? Yes. Is it black or Hispanic? Both. No! Where the hell are they? Why do not you ask Albert? He knows Tampa. You know why molasses and the rum that comes to Florida Are you in Tampa, Maso? Because of the tunnels. What tunnels? Those who pass under this neighborhood. That's how they bring the alcohol. That's where my men are. Your men are guarding the front door. But let's not go there. Let's attack him, Masc. But let's get underneath. Go! Go! Did you check the room? All. The whole floor. Seppe, take another look. Chief, they saw the Coughlin down there. Does he have any scratches? A blow to the head. I do not think we can expect him to die of septicemia. I do not think we have that much time. It's hard for a man To have such a stupid son. It's all empty, boss. Guard the door and the stairs Like Roman centurions. You can fill one for me. Where were you hiding? Hidden? When Seppe checked the room. I was sitting here. I asked him if he wanted to work for someone who will be alive tomorrow. Is it enough? That's what I want to put an idiot like Digger in charge. We had something good here and spoiled it all in one day. Do you know how many people died here because of your bullshit? Maybe someday you'll have a baby and you'll understand. What will I understand? How is my son? Your son is dead. They were going to kill us all. They were going after us. You know that. They did not expect to get old. I do not expect it either. I had something prepared to tell Albert before I killed him. Too late. Very well. I do not want more deaths today. Do any of you want to die? No, Mr. Coughlin. Anyone who wants to go back to Boston has my blessing. Can go. But if anyone wants to stay here, Where the soil is warm and the girls are beautiful, We have jobs. But I'm out of it. You want to talk to the boss? Talk to him. Now, he's the boss. Is there any question? Great. To Graciela. Come on. Clean this crap. Dion was the leader for eight years. And he was right. He did not grow old. Say what you have to say. What happened? Had the accident and decided to take advantage? Do not. So what? What happened, Emma? When the cop came after us, Told the driver we would only escape if we were thrown off the bridge. But he did not listen to me. And then? I gave him a shot. We fell into the water and I swam to the shore. I ran to the nearest house. He was a fisherman. He did not care to welcome me. Did not you want to contact me? If he showed up, they would kill me. I owed you nothing. I've cried for years. Why do not you tell me how you want me to feel? Maybe if my father was a police chief in a good part of Ireland. But I had to get away like I could. Have you ever loved me? We had a good time, Joe. There were special moments, of course. But you wanted it to be something it was not. what? A lie. We are not children of God. We do not live in a fairy tale with true love. We're fucking dancing for life do not run away. I'm free, Joseph. If you want to stop by, you're always welcome. We always had so much fun. I do not want to be free. Come on. We always wanted that. That's what you wanted. And now you have. Goodbye, Emma. We build Graciela's houses For abandoned women and children who had nowhere to stay. We named my father to our son. But he was thoughtful, like his mother. Yes, Tomas. Where are you going? Where are you going? Repent. Repent. Repent. Repent. Come here, dear. Let me get you. Repent! Repent! - To as as! - Repent! Repent! Repent! Repent! You are fine? Do not. Do not. Do not. Heaven! Do not. Oh my God, no. ON EARTH RIDERS OF THE EASTERN HILL On Saturdays, I take my son to the movies. A little German is creating problems abroad. But I do not think there is another war. No one has anything to gain. My son loved the movie. It was about an honest sheriff in a corrupt city. HORSES OF THE EASTERN HILL He kept saying he wanted a badge when he grew up. REALIZATION MONTGOMERY QUINN ARGUMENT DANIEL COUGHLIN It's my brother. That's my brother's name. It's your uncle. In the afternoon, we caught perch and sea bass. One day, my son asked me: "Where is heaven in heaven?" And I told him what Loretta had told me. "This is paradise here. "We're in it now." LIVING AT NIGHT LIVING AT NIGHT ENCODED BY: VRXX
