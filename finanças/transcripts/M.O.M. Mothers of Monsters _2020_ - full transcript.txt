- Where are we gonna find it? - Jacob, what did you do? - What? - Did you mean to hurt it? - What? - Did you hurt it on purpose? - What's "on purpose"? - Did you mean to kill it or was it an accident, sweetheart? Daddy and I want to know. Look at me. Jacob. Just turn the camera off. Just turn it off. - This is the kind of shit I come home to. Seven pairs. Seven pairs. Sounds bother him. Certain sounds, anyway. Like high heels on linoleum. Yeah, well... I'm keeping track of this shit now, Jacob. I'm recording it. - I hate you, mom! - You hear that? That's Jacob blowing a fit because I told him he had to reimburse me. You wanna monster out, that's fine. Monster out. - Leave me alone. Fucking psycho. - Yeah, I'm a fucking psycho. 'Cause I told him, until he reimburses me, he's not getting his PlayStation back. I'm recording this! Jacob. It was seven pairs. - I didn't touch your stupid shoes. - What? - I didn't touch your stupid shoes. - Very funny. What did you throw? What smashed? - Nothing. You're the one "monstering out", okay? Just take a bath or something... Welcome to the worst town in America; Parma, Ohio. - Hey. I am here interviewing the aloof new boy of the school, Jacob Bell, everyone! Save "hi", Jacob. Stop it! - My name is Abbey. I live in Parma, Ohio-- Oh shit! I'm thirty. Well, mid 30s. Mid to late 30s. Not 40... Definitely not 40. My name is Abbey. I'm 42 years old. I'm a single mom. My son, Jacob, he just turned 16, which is... Well, that's a handful for any kind of mom. The thing is... Jacob is... I think he is, anyway... I think he's going to... This is stupid. - Dude, we gotta get outta here. We're gonna get arrested, bro. What are you doing? - Natural selection. - Oh, don't even play like that, bro. You're gonna cause a fucking accident or something. Oh fuck! Shit! Get the fuck out of here, bro! Dude go, go, go! - Look at this. If this was just for his geometry assignment, why would he draw himself, huh? "To demonstrate scale" my ass. And here, look at this. Why would a 14 year old boy even have this, huh? What kind of kid wants to turn his pellet gun into an automatic weapon? Bump stocks were not invented for fucking air guns, I'll tell you that. I'm sorry, I just... I don't understand why there aren't more resources out there to deal with this kind of thing. I reported him two years ago. And yeah, they launched an investigation, put Jacob under surveillance. "Your son provided a rational explanation "for every offense." That's what they said. "Rational explanation." Now I'm the bad guy 'cause Jacob served time in a diversion program and we had to move. Again. He's already in therapy, so couldn't blame me for that one. My mom spent a shit ton in legal fees to get all this stuff back, too. God forbid it goes on his record. She's like, "You don't wanna be the boy who cried 'wolf', do you?" I'm like, "No, mom. "I don't." By the way, the boy who cried wolf got eaten by the fuckin' wolf. - We were talking about how to get more bang for your buck out of everyone's favorite AR-15. And with you guys shooting the .223s or the 5.56s, everyone knows-- - Sleeping Jacob is my favorite Jacob. He had almost a two hour tantrum. Worked himself into a fit. Now he's sleeping. Honey, I don't think you can climb on that! - There are all those babies living in there. - That's somebody's-- That's a birdhouse. No, no! Babies, no! - There are baby birds in there. - Let go, now! - What? - Let go. - That's why that bird is swooping at your head. - They're very upset. - Walk away! - You know that's illegal, right? - The light's red. - What are you recording me for? - I want to capture that miraculous transformation you make. When you're alone in the car with mom to when you're not alone in the car with mom. - For what; for who? Hey, Detective Kelly, remember me? Mom's freaking out again. - Knock it off. - She came home totally hammered and she cut up all her shoes. She's probably gonna say I did it, but just for the record. Later. - You're disgusting. Look me in the eye and say that again. - You were drunk. You cut up your shoes. Again. Fucking go already. - Well, he knows I'm recording, so. Technically, he's still in the car with mom. This may be the "other Jacob" emerging. The fake Jacob. The thing is, he doesn't fit the profile of a... I mean he has friends and gets good grades. His teachers like him. Except from that one jerky science teacher, everyone loves the fake Jacob. To be honest, every time they tell me I'm wrong, that I'm exaggerating his symptoms, I feel this enormous sense of relief. I mean, what if it is me? What if Jacob is okay? "Psychosomatic projection", I think they call it. It's when you experience this trauma as a kid, this extreme fucking trauma and you project that on your husband, your kid, your parents. Then I think, "What if it's not me?" What if it's genetic? Sometimes when I look in his eyes I get this replay, this instant fucking replay of Jerry, and I imagine him in that Mustang with his sawed off-- - Pickup and drop-off only, ma'am. - Thank you! Sorry. This is his room. When he's not at school, this is where he spends most of his time. All of his time. This is Adolf. Hi! Last one died, so this is Adolf Junior. Or Adolf Junior Jr., maybe. As you can see, he plays a lot of video games. I think that's pretty normal. I mean, is that normal? Spend five, six hours a day? I don't know, just... Shooting people. People say it's normal. People. What's not normal, is this. Are you kidding me? Jesus. - Talk American. - Would you like me better if I was British? - No. - Hey, you've gotta help me with my science project. - It's so easy. - It's not easy for all of us. Aren't you supposed to be really smart or something? What are you doing? You're such an asshole! - Whatever. He's fucking old anyway. - Why? You think we should just kill off all old people? - Yes! That is a good idea! - Oh Whatever. - See? You're already halfway done with your science project. - Fucking jaw off... - Say what you just said. I'm serious. Say what you just said. - Stop already. - Knock it off. - Chill, mom, seriously. - Let go. Ow, you're hurting me. - I'm not even touching you. - Jacob! See, that's exactly what I'm talking about. Okay, I got this when he was around two of wetting the bed with his diapers on. I caught him taking them off, pissing the bed, and putting his diapers back on again. Little creep. Shit, where's the charging thingy? Testing. All right... Okay, so it's May 4th, 2018, by the way. Jacob should be home any minute. If his PlayStation isn't back in his room, he's gonna rip my jaw off. That's what he said, "I'll rip your fucking jaw off." Look, I know. I know I'm not handling this well; I know that. He can't keep breaking my shit. He's not a little kid anymore. I know, I know... I'm a mom. I'm a mom-- Hey. - Mom... What the hell is this? - Sign it, and I will give you your PlayStation back. - Are you fucking joking? - Lose the attitude, Jacob. You can pay me back a little bit at a time. Why are you calling me? - Why do you think? - I'm not recording you. - Where is it? - It's not in there, Jacob. - Where the fuck is my PlayStation? I told you; I warned you! - And I told you if you sign it, you will get it back. Jacob, don't do that. God, if you could just not be a little shit for once... Okay, you know what? I'm out. I'm not doing this with you. Okay-- Jacob! Stop it now! No! - I'm sorry. - I know. - So, what was the worst day of your life? - Jesus... Probably the day my stepmom moved in. - Why? - I don't know. Because it just meant my mom wasn't coming home and it made everything like really final. And she sucks. She's the worst. - Want me to just kill her? - Yeah, Jacob, fantastic idea. Thank you. So, is it true you moved here because you got kicked out of Riverside? - Is that your question? - Yeah. - You and everybody else. Ask me something original. - Okay, what's with the long sleeves all the time? - What's with all the fuckin' push-up bras? - Whoa, it's truth or dare. You have to answer. C'mon-- - Stop it. It's a stupid game. - Okay, and this is his Risperidone. It's kinda like an antidepressant. Well, actually it's an antipsychotic but that's a bit much. He takes that with the Carbamazepine, which is for seizures. Well, that's wrong. I mean, it's not wrong, it's just not why he takes it. Adderall, 15 milligrams of this every morning. For his, y'know-- His attention deficit. Can you hear me now? - I can hear you just fine. Your face just keeps freezing up. Why can't we just talk on the telephone? - You look fine, mom. - Yeah, look at my hair! Let me get some lipstick on. - Listen, mom, Jacob's gonna be home soon. Could you just-- - I'm listening, honey. I'm just getting my lipstick thingy. - He's having the tantrums again. The other day, he pinned me up against a wall and I couldn't get out from underneath him. - Well why would you let him do that? Boys aren't supposed to wrestle with their mothers. That's what fathers are for. - No, don't. Don't do that. - What? What'd I do? I didn't even say his name. - We weren't wrestling, mom. He was angry, okay? - Well he's a teenager. Teenagers are moody, especially boys. All those hormones. - No, this wasn't hormones, mom. His eyes, they were blank, detached. He looked like... He looked like Jerry. - I don't wanna do this again, Abbey. - I know you don't want to do this, mom. I don't want to do this either, but what if they were wrong? I mean, mom, if you could have done something to stop Jerry, you would have done it, right? - You don't even know what you're talking about! You were a baby. - I was twelve. - I don't wanna talk about this. - Mom, there must have been some kind of signs. You must have noticed something. - I can't believe this is happening again. Are you taking your medications? - Yes, of course I'm taking my medication. - But they're not helping? - They're not helping Jacob. Jesus, mom. - Okay, what did you find? Did you find something? - No, I don't... He's cutting up my shoes again and the nicks on his arms. - New nicks? - No. I don't know. I mean, mom, what if he hurts me? What if he hurts someone else? - Abigail, the things you're saying... What you're implying, it's very serious. - I know! - I don't think you should tell anyone. - I'm telling you, mom. - And I believed you the last time, all the way to the end. Universities look for that kind of stuff. I know they say they don't, but they do. And all those medications you have him on, they all go on his record. I warned you about that; If something bad happens and Jacob takes the fall. - No, mom, I'm trying to prevent something bad from happening. - Maybe you should talk to Howard. You remember Howard? Howard's a vault. - 'Kay, you know what, mom? I gotta go. I'll call you later. - Abigail, you're not sure, are you? - I'll call you later. - Call who later? - Is that Jacob? Honey, is that you? - Nana? What up, Nana? - Oh my god, you're gigantic! So handsome! - Aw, c'mon now, Nana. You say that to all the boys! - What a horrible face. Uncross your eyes! - Nana, my eyes are stuck! I'm gonna be cross-eyed forever! Oh my god! Nana, no! Hey, thanks for the birthday cash you sent. That was awesome. - I wanted to get you a present, but you're so hard to shop for these days. - Oh, so get this. Urban has these killer combat boots. You can order them online and everything. - Urban... Urban what? - Here, just type in this website, ready? - Oh no, no, no. I can't. Just buy the boots with the birthday present I sent. - What if you set me up with a credit card and I'll hook you up with a dope-ass Snapchat account where you can see what I'm doing like every five minutes. - Don't listen to him, mom. - Yeah, you may have gotten bigger but you haven't changed a bit! - Is that a yes? - No, you can get him a credit card when he's 18. - Deal. But I better put a limit on it. - Did you just hang up on her? Why would you do that? - When I'm 18? Please. - Jacob? Jacob, I know you're down here. Jacob, honey? - Ah! - Oh my god! Jesus, you scared... God damn it... Are you in my robe? - Shipping out your Eczema cream, but we couldn't retail your-- For the cosmetic moisturizing gloves because it looks like your mom's credit card expired. - He install this himself? - I don't know, I guess he must have. - Man, you got a smart kid on your hands. - Yeah, thanks. I really appreciate it. - Yeah. - God, it smells like crap in here. Like burnt rubber or something... His baby pictures. He was six when he started drawing these. As you can see, they've been rescued from the trash a few times. I asked him if that was me; if that was Jacob in Mommy's belly. He said no, it was Nana; he didn't know who the baby was. I mean, if that's Nana, then who's the baby? I never told him about my brother. I never told him about Jerry. Anyway... Oh, nice, Jacob. Oh, Jesus... Shit. Oh my god! Shit, shit, shit! No, c'mon, get back in. He feeds these to Adolf, that's all. What the... Jesus Christ... Holy shit. What the fuck did he do to it? Oh, Jesus... I suppose you're gonna find a rational explanation for this too, huh? My name is Abbey. I'm 42 years old. I'm a single mom. I think my 16 year old son is a psychopath. I'm not trying to prove it anymore. By the time, I'm sure it'll be too late. I'm not doing this for the authorities, either. No, I'm... I'm making these videos for you. For all you other moms out there who know deep down that your kid is a bad kid. But you still love him. Because he's your son. We're gonna look for signs. We're gonna look for patterns, you and me, and together, we're gonna figure out if you are "that" mom and if your kid is "that" kid. I mean, let's face it. If I'm wrong, if these videos never see the light of day... But if I'm right, if you're watching this, I'm already dead. I'm not saying therapists can't help, but do your own research. And not just on the internet either; there are books, interviews, published studies. Okay, so there's the usual stuff; the lack of empathy, antisocial behavior, pathological lying. That's a big one. But then there are the more subtle signs like chronic conspiracy theories or racism. That's a big one. NPV, Narcissistic Personality Disorder. I hope you're writing this down. I guess you could always just rewind. By the way, if you're not a mom with a troubled kid and you're watching this, you're a psychopath too. Have some fucking respect. - You're crazy. I don't know, man. - This is Jacob Bell coming to you live with the electro shock challenge. We got a electric dog collar that I stole from my stupid neighbor and this should pack a pretty heavy punch to my jugular. So let's try some levels. Let's start with... Eight. - An eight? Oh shit, man. You are out of your mind! - Pussy. Three-- - I don't know about this, man. - Two, one. - Oh shit! Bro, are you all right? - That was fucking awesome! - What kind of supplies. - Well, the science lab is missing some specimen pins, closures, sodium hydroxide, a container of formaldehyde. - Great, so if I hadn't stopped by today I'd just have to guess why my son got detention? - We sent the letter. - I told you that's not my signature. - Listen, is this gonna go on his record. - His record? No, this stays in his file until he graduates. - I don't know why you guys are still teaching dissection anyway. It was banned in the Riverside district two years ago. - It's not about dissection, really. It's more about electric muscle stimulation; teaching the students about the human body. - Great. - Look, Jacob is a very gifted student. I wouldn't worry so much about what's in his file, just put it into conversation with him. Transparency is key with this sort of thing. - Of course. I'm so sorry to have barged in. - Which parking lot are you in? - Where are you going? Well, he's not going to Greg's house, that's obvious. What is he doing over here? What? Oh no... No, no. I mean, it's not like he can get a gun. Right? All right, well, it's on. I can't figure out how to do the "record" thingy. Spy camera number one; kitchen cam. Okay, so kitchen cam is housed in this nifty little electrical outlet thingy. Kitchen cam, meet living room cam. Looks like a normal digital picture frame, right? Except, see that little pinhole right there? That's actually a camera. The best part? It's motion activated. Same deal with the one I'm putting in Jacob's room. Jacob cam. So these new cameras will let me see what Jacob's up to when I'm not home. Okay, here we go. Hi Dr. Arden. I'm sorry, I completely lost track of time. - No worries. You remember me? - Of course, yeah! - I watched that clip you sent; that video from Jacob. When did this start? This behavior? - When he was a baby. An infant. He didn't like to be touched so he'd just lay there screaming at me. I mean, I was always his mom, you know? His hero, his protector, but by the time he was 14 I didn't know who he was anymore. - I understand he received counseling at the time. - He's been in counseling since he was seven years old. He was drawing these disturbing pictures with this baby with this knife and, I don't know, some kind of bloodbath. - Your mother mentioned that, yeah... Do you remember the pictures you used to draw when you were a young girl, Abbey? - No. - Yeah, your mother, she didn't want them in the house. - I'm sorry... - What's that? - I was kinda hoping we could just talk about Jacob. - Of course, of course. Was he ever diagnosed as CU? Callous and unemotional traits? - No. - Has he ever been hospitalized. - No, he's pretty much outsmarted every therapist he's ever had. - Do you think Jacob is really capable of harming you, Abbey? - I don't know. I mean, I keep having this crazy dream where I'm standing on a stool in the middle of the living room and there's something around my neck. Like a rope, but not a rope. Smoother than a rope. I've wet myself, I know that sounds crazy, but my pajama bottoms are wet. They're itchy. - How did you get up on that stool? - I don't know. All I know is that something has happened. He's done something really really bad. - Who? - Jacob. And he's giggling, laughing like he's proud of what he's done; he's won, somehow. Like the joke's on me. I just kinda wanna step off the stool. - Do you? - What? Oh, no. No. - I'd like you to consider, for a moment, that it's not Jacob who put you up on that stool. - What? I put myself up there? I wrapped a cord around my own neck and strung myself from the ceiling? - Is there any chance that in this dream it was Jerry who put you up on that stool? - Seriously? - I don't want to rule out any possibilities, that's all. - I can't believe this is happening. Of course this is happening. - The fact that Jacob just turned 16 is significant, Abbey. That's the same age that Jerry was when he-- - Yeah, you know what, I get it. The last thing I need right now is someone else telling me that I'm the problem. Fucking asshole. Fuck. Look at the rest. Not bad. It looks like a smoke detector, right? Safety first. Okay, so it's Monday, 3:30-ish. It's smaller than his, I know, but when we moved it was his turn to get the big closet. Hey, take a look at this. Eh? That, my friends, is a live feed. I couldn't figure out how to get you, mister nanny cam, to hook up. You're too old. You're incompatible or something. Don't take it personally. Yeah, see, look. That one went off 'cause no one's in the living room or the kitchen. Now I think Jacob cam is still recording, because, do you see that in there? That, my friends, is a birthday present from dad. Belated, FYI. It is an aquarium with a couple of rats. I'm not joking, that's what he wanted. We're supposed to be getting him gym shorts and a 200 watt transformer, whatever the hell that is. We've been at this store all of five minutes and Jacob is already MIA. Surprise. Just show me the cover. - Greg's mom let him get this when he was, like, 12. - Well I'm not Greg's mom. - What's with the drives? - Oh, um... For my photos. - What photos? - You know, for work. Real estate listings, open houses. This says 18 and over, Jacob. - What listings? You haven't sold a property in like a year. - I can't let you get this. Get something else. - Like a PlayStation? - Actually, I was thinking maybe instead of paying me back we could work out a different kind of deal. - Like what? - I don't know. Maybe we could talk, have a conversation. - About what? - I don't know, anything. Whatever comes up. You know, 15 minutes a day for like, I don't know, a week. - Five days? - Seven. - Four. - Fine, five. - How 'bout we have a conversation right now for an hour and 15 minutes and I get it back today? - Starting tomorrow, Jacob. Hey, honey, turn right. Your transformer thingy should be in aisle four. What do you need it for anyway? Hey, can you slow down? - Conversation starts tomorrow, mom. - Oh c'mon, Jacob. - So you moved here with your mom, right? - Yup. - Well, where's your dad? - That's enough. Your turn. - C'mon. - How do you like being filmed? - Oh, come on. - How do you like it? Yo, I'm in the street, Jacob. That's dangerous. Stop, I'm serious. Fucking dick. - No, I already uploaded all the footage on an external drive and I can't view it because I keep getting this error message that says, "operation not allowed". I need what program? You guys are real crooks, you know that? - Hi. - Jacob? - What's that? - I didn't say anything. - Your face keeps freezing. Can you hear me? - Yeah, I can hear you. Can you hear me? - What's that? - I said I can hear you fine. - Mom. - What? Why can't you hear me? - Gotcha. You thought this is a live feed, right? Here's a little tip. If you don't see your image in the bottom right hand corner, it's not live. It's prerecorded. So even though it seems like we're having a conversation right now, we're really not. Sike! I'm totally kidding. I'm using this new program Greg has. What's it called, dude? - What's what called? - This new program they're beta testing that's better than Google Hangout or whatever. He said it's called "Smart Chat for Idiots", I guess. Mom-- - That's not funny. - Mom. - What? - Do you know why it's called that? - No, I don't. It's probably a spinoff from the whole "For Dummies" franchise. - Oh and guess what I'm doing right now. - I don't know. You're talking to me, sort of. - Eh, wrong, try again. - You're fucking with her, right? - The "F" word is not okay, Greg. Right mom? - Who are you messing with? Are you messing with me? - Jacob! - Jesus Christ! Fuck off. - I'm hanging up right now. - Topic number one. How many idiots can there really be in this world? - And this does not count as one of our conversations, FYI. - I mean, we've got Greg here. He's clearly an idiot. And then there's... Well, there's you. You're an ever bigger idiot than he is. Because even though I actually told you this wasn't live, that it couldn't be unless you saw your own image in the bottom right hand corner, you're still talking back to this prerecorded video, aren't you? Sorry to break it to you, mom, but the only part of "Smart Chat for Idiots" that's real is the idiot part. And that would be... I bet there's a little part of you that still wants to believe this is live. Am I right? "Jacob is live." "Snapchat me." "I'm one of the cool moms." Well guess what. You'll never be one of the cool moms because you're a fucking idiot. One convo down, only four to go. So why don't we meet back here tomorrow? Same time, same-- Place. You still there? You better be. Because I'm holding up my end of the bargain. Because that was our deal and I want my fucking PlayStation back. Mom! - One sec! - You got another package! - What? What did you say? Oh, probably just my Eczema cream. - You should really be wearing your mitts. So what'd you think? - On what? - The video. - I thought it was mean. - I totally got you. - It's not funny, Jacob. You called me an idiot in front of your friend. - He's not my friend. - What do you mean? What happened? Jacob? - How many minutes left? - Don't be like that. Fine, fifteen starting now. - Cheater. Volt 100, meet mom. Or maybe this is Volt 200. - So what happened with you and Greg? - Nothing. - Can we just talk for a minute? - We are talking. What's that thing? Um, I just thought I'd put some pictures up. So what happened with you and Greg? - Is that on a digital loop or something? - Digital what? Can you stop doing that? Stop pivoting. Just talk to me. What happened with you and Greg? Did you guys have a fight or something? - Doesn't matter. - Of course it matters, he's your best friend. - No, he's not. He's a lowlife circumcised douche bag. - What? - How many photos are in this thing? - I don't know, twelve, maybe? - Who took this one at the beach? Dad? - Probably. Jacob, what do you mean by circumcised? - He's even a shitty photographer. - Jacob! - I don't know, mom. Circumcised, like they cut the tip of his dick off. - So? - So he's a fucking Jew. - So? - I totally remember those gay pajamas. - Jacob, what do you care if Greg is Jewish? - Why do you get to ask all the questions? So how come my inheritance is contingent on me going to college? Doesn't Nana know by now that college is a total waste of time? What did you major in, again? Psychology? - What's your point, Jacob? - Hasn't it ever occurred to you that college is just a scam perpetuated by none other than, well, dumbfuck parents? - Jacob... - Isn't it a little strange that right before a kid turns 18, right when their parents still have legal authority over them happens to coincide with the exact age of your average would-be freshman? Right in that unbelievably little convenient pocket of time, kids get coerced by their own parents into a nationwide, bonafide, institutionalized Ponzi scheme. Wow, you look shit faced in that one. - Wanna know why I think you should go to college? 'Cause I think you're really smart. - So what do I need college for? - Because it's a great place to, you know, figure out what you're good at, what you want to do in life. - Total propaganda. I already know what I'm good at. - Yeah? What are you good at, Jacob? - You don't know? - I think you're good at a lot of things. - Name one. - Well I think your good at science. - Not according to Mr. Fuckner. - Yeah, can we talk about that for a minute? Why you got detention from Mr. Buckner? - You want a hint? - No, Jacob. I don't want a hint, I want you to tell me. - Ow, fuck! It fucking bit me! - Oh my god, honey. Let me see! - Ow, ow, ow! My finger, it's bleeding everywhere. - I can't see. Which finger? - Gotcha. See mom. I'm good at psychology. I don't need a fucking degree. - What is wrong with you? - Mom, your alarm. - For your information, Nana's mother was Jewish. So technically, you're a Jew too. - Seriously, can you shut it off? It's really fucking annoying. - Hello? Hi. Yes, I heard. What? Oh my god. Is Greg okay? Well, if he's too afraid to admit Jacob did it, how am I supposed to talk to him about it? Well, no, I understand, but maybe we should file a police-- No, of course, I understand. Hey, maybe I could come by. No, sure. Look, I'm so sorry. The boys were playing with a gas mask. Someone put formaldehyde in the air canister. Boys. Boys, boys, boys, stop! Jacob! You're not in trouble, sweetheart. She just doesn't want you to throw it at her. Jacob, don't throw that at her. - No! - Don't throw it! Jacob-- Hey. - What's on your face? You look like a freak. - So where you going? - Stalker. Listen, I think you should spend this weekend with your dad. I bought you a bus ticket. - Fuck, mom, I'm 16. - 3:00 p.m. tomorrow, you're on a bus to see dad. - Mom? - Launched a joint air strike with the United States and France against Syria. White Power marched through the streets of Charlottesville without hoods and without shame. This is the largest national rally in over two decades. There's a lot more of us than this country realizes and we're done hiding. Did you see that? They maced me. This is war! We'll kill these people if we have to. Perfect storm of easy access to guns, ongoing cuts and-- - Yes, yes, I am spying on my son. I never told him about my brother. I never told him about Jerry. - Weirdo. - Standing on a stool in the middle of the living room and there's something around my neck. What the fuck did he do to it? Jacob! Stop it now! What if it's genetic? - No! - The boy who cried wolf got eaten by the fucking wolf. - Dude, go, go! - Jacob cam. - Remember me? - Jerry. My name is Abbey. I think my 16 year old son is a psychopath. - Well, actually, he's at his dad's. I told you, Frank was fine with it. He's not missing any school. It's Friday. That's him on the other line, I gotta call you back. No, Frank. Mom, I didn't dump him on anyone, okay? Can you give me a fucking break? Hello? Shit... Hello? Hello? Hey, Frank, sorry about that. I was just-- What do you mean? No, I dropped him off at the station at 2:45. Fairview. Well did you actually go down and pick him up or did you just-- Hold on. Jacob! - See, if I was surrounded by six or eight of these things, would I stand a chance with them? Well there's no problem. If you have a gun, shoot them in the head-- - No, I don't know, it's just... The television just went off for some reason. Just bear with me, Frank. Don't hang up. Jacob! Yeah, he's here. Turn it down. - What? - Your stereo, turn it down. He's supposed to be with you... Frank. - Hello? Obviously. Oh really? On a scale of 1 to 10, what's scarier? Me not calling or mom standing in front of me with a butcher knife? - It's not a butcher knife. It's not a butcher knife! I was making a salad; it's a salad knife. - Jesus... Can we have some privacy, please? Dad? - Shit. Define "privacy". Butcher knife. Please. - I don't know. - Shit. - Oh my god, yes. I know, but, y'know, she's my mom. - Unbelievable. Jacob's saying he didn't want to leave me alone. That he was worried I might "freak out". Oh shit. Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit... No... Look, I know I shouldn't have pawned him off on his dad for the weekend, but I just needed to clear my fucking head, okay? It's not like I can turn him in. He'd probably say the lizards were already dead and he was just doing a science experiment. You know Greg is never gonna rat him out. Pun intended. So what does that leave me? I just wish I could talk to him. But he doesn't know how to talk. He never really learned. If you can still talk to your son, talk to him before he hates you for allowing him not to. I mean, let's face it. Even if I could turn him in, I probably wouldn't. For the same millions of reasons you can't. Y'know? One more school, one more semester, one more doctor. One more chance. Jacob? Can we talk? I wanna talk. I wanna listen. Jacob... Sweetheart, you still have my phone. Jacob? Jacob? Jacob. Unlock the door! Jacob! You think this is funny? Unlock the fucking door. Oh no, no, no... Oh fuck... Oh fuck, oh fuck, oh fuck... Okay. Jacob, honey. Okay, I understand you're upset about the, you know, about the cameras, but I didn't show anything to anyone. I promise, okay? So just unlock the door, okay? I'm not mad. I won't be mad. Damn it! Damn it! You think your mother's stupid? You think I'm stupid? Fuck you... All right. Let's see if we just-- Jacob! Jacob! Jacob! Jacob! - Sorry about the whole chair thing. It's for your own protection. Volt 100 tried to escape too. Three times, to be exact. I haven't figured out the exact voltage yet. Didn't wanna risk it for your sake. I like your movie! I'm not crazy about where you were going with the ending, though. I mean, where were you going with it? Did you really think I'd shoot up my school? So lame. We can do better than that. So here's the deal, mom. Mom! Mom. Good. I've cloned your screen, FYI. And everything in your room is hot so I wouldn't try anything stupid, okay? Nod or something. Good. So this might be very hard for you to believe but I'm actually not a psychopath. I mean, if I was, don't you think you'd be dead by now? And for your information, I legally can't be diagnosed with anything more than sociopathic tendencies. Under 18. Brain's... Still developing. Of course, Jerry was 16 too, so technically he wasn't a psychopath either. But seven kids... That's jacked up. The internet doesn't keep secrets, mom. So here's what's going to happen next; I'm going to come in there. I'm going to remove your gag, you're not going to say anything. You're not even gonna open your mouth. Got it? Then I'm going to untie your hands and you're going to use this to record a new ending to the movie. Part one. "My name is Abbey. "I'm 42 years old. "I'm a single mom and my son is not a psychopath." You have to really mean it, mom. "I'm the one with problems". Pause; you have to pause after that part. You have to really reflect for a minute. "I'm the one who needs help." Pause again. I mean if you could get a little teary-eyed for this next part, that would totally, totally sell it. "I'm the one who told Jerry to do it. "I'm the psychopath." Think you can do that? - Somebody help! - Sorry, but that's the deal, mom. Non-negotiable. Then you turn the camera off, I tie your hands back up, I go into the other room and I play back the recording, and if I like it, if you do a really really good job with it, then I upload the footage to a protected cloud server and you, you get to come out of your room! I'm gonna delete the other footage. Or most of it, anyway. And if you ever mess with me again you'll be the one in a fucking diversion program. Cool? Memorize it. - Jacob. Jacob, please. My name is Abbey. I'm 42 years old. I'm a single mom and my son... My son is not a psychopath. I'm the one who needs help. I'm the one who told him... Who told Jerry to do it. I'm the psychopath. - Out-fucking-standing. Arms. - Jacob, please. - Arms. - You have what you want. I'm not gonna tell anybody, just let me sit here until you come back, okay? - Final warning. - Jacob, you said that was part one. What's part two? No! No! No! Stop it! What is that? Jacob, stop it right now! - I didn't wanna do that. Why did you make me do that? Shit. I didn't wanna do that. I didn't...

Jacob. I'm pretty sure you can see me through this. When I turn it on, anyway. I don't see any other cameras around here, so... Listen, I just... I just wanted to tell you that I know what I did was a really really shitty thing to do. And I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I made a mistake. Moms screw up sometimes. And I screwed up. And I know I should have told you. I should have told you about Jerry. He was 16. Papa bought him this car, this old beat up Mustang. Jerry used to take me out in it for rides with the windows down, and the engine was so loud it used to just drown out the whole world. Nobody else existed. Just him and me. We all knew he was hurting. He was keeping to himself a lot and his eyes changed. It's like they stopped looking. They stopped seeing. But you know, if you need help, you ask for it. That's how it worked in my family and he didn't ask. He didn't ask... Then one day he took a shotgun down to Bridge Creek where all the kids would be making out in their cars and no one knows why he did it. But all of a sudden he just came flying out of that Mustang and started shooting. Kids. Classmates. Everybody; anybody. No reason. No reason. Just because he could. Seven kids. Seven. None of them survived. He blew them to pieces. And the thing is... I didn't hate him so much for killing those kids as I did for putting a gun to his own head before I had a chance to say goodbye... Before I got one last ride in that Mustang. Well... I was just a kid... Barely 12. But the thing is, honey, sweetheart, you are nothing like him. You are nothing like Jerry. You couldn't kill anybody, Jacob. I know that; I know you can't. You're not capable of it. I don't believe that you are. I don't believe that you are. I love you, honey. Your mommy loves you. I do. I'm so sorry... I'm so sorry. Okay... Jacob. Jacob, honey, I'm thirsty. Your mother needs some water. I'll, um... I'll turn my back to the door. Please don't take my sunshine away. What do you want from me? - Hey, Nana! Yeah, yeah, mom's just taking a nap. I'm sorry, I gotta run. - Help! Help! Somebody help me! He's gonna kill me! He's gonna fucking kill me! Help me! Help! Help, please, help me! Help me! Mom! - That was really stupid, mom. - Jacob. Jacob. Jacob, you have to stop this right now. How long have I been in here? How long have I fucking been in here, god damn it? - Part two. - I'm not gonna say that. I'm not gonna say that. - I'm warning you. - No! I'm warning you! Is this what you want? Is this how you want your movie to end? - That's gonna hurt, mom. Go ahead. It's not gonna kill you. It'll just, you know... You're making this a lot more difficult than it has to be. Turn the camera off, turn the camera back on, say your lines, turn the camera back off again. That's it. Ta-da! No more closet. - I don't believe you. - You're mumbling. Talk into the camera. - I don't believe you. - Don't you get it? I'm trying to fucking help you. You were never supposed to be in the closet this long. That wasn't part of the plan! That was not part of the plan! Fuck... - Oh! No! Oh, baby... Sweetheart, you're sick. You're sick... You need help; it's not your fault. It's not your fault. I can help you. Mommy can help you. - You sure about that, mom? - Somebody help me. Please... Help... Help! Somebody help me... Help me? Somebody? Somebody help me. Jacob... Jacob. Jacob. Let me out. Let me out... Jacob? Jacob? - Mom? - Look at my hands. Look at them. Why are they getting better? Why are they healing? What were you putting in my meds? Listen, I have to ask you. If I do this, if I say the lines, you gonna kill me? - I'm not gonna kill you, Mom. I'm not gonna kill anyone. You are. Part two. "Jacob's not going to kill me. "He's not going to kill anyone. "I am." - Jacob's not gonna kill me. Jacob's not gonna kill anyone. I am. - Pretty pathetic, mom. Might even be worse than your bullshit melodramatic "Jerry never said goodbye" monologue. Follow the directions. Power off, power on, say your lines, power off again. And sit up already, you look like a zombie. - And then what? - Then I transfer the footage and I set an alarm. When you hear the alarm, that means you can come out of the closet. - And then what? - I don't know, mom. I'll be at school by then. I mean, the most obvious choice would be to get up on the stool and y'know. - Jacob. This movie is not gonna end the way you want it to. - Oh really? How's it going to end? - Jacob is going to let his mother out of the closet. He thinks it's too late for that, but it's not. And together, they are going to erase the footage, all of it. - "They" are? Hm... What a snooze fest. Okay, how 'bout this? How about Jacob threatens to do exactly what his mother always feared he would do, sort of like a self-fulfilling prophecy or, what did you call it? A psychosomatic projection! Dude, that's good, write that down. Okay, so Jacob says something like, "Hey, mom. "Record your lines or I'm gonna take a gun to school "and mow down the entire freshman class." C'mon, mom. You don't want those kids to end up like Jerry's pals, do 'ya? I'm totally kidding. Look, there's nothing really to negotiate here. I mean we both know you're gonna climb up on that stool. I mean, how could you not? "I'm the one who told Jerry to do it. "I'm the psychopath." Of course, if you don't have the balls to go through with it you could always watch this little video I made for you. Oh, and I'll have the drives with me so don't even bother. Say your lines. Say your lines! Mom, just say your lines. Say your fucking lines! - Jacob... Jacob? - Mom? You scared me. I thought you... I don't know, I thought something happened or... Are you okay? Your camera is faced the wrong way. - I'm not gonna do it. I'm not gonna say the lines. I'm sorry. - What the fuck? - I can't let you get away with this. - What are you doing? Mom, stop. Don't! - Goodbye, Jacob. - Mom, don't-- Mom? Mom? Fuck! Mom? Mom, mom, mom... Please, please, please... Mom? Why did you do that? Okay, okay... Fuck! Fuck... Okay, okay, okay. Come on... Shit, shit... Think, think, think... Think! Nana! Nana... Nana, uh... Nana. Na-na... Something's wrong with mom. She, uh... She's... She's covered in wires and something happened. Her body is... What the fuck is happening? What the fuck is happening to me? What the fuck is happening to me? What the fuck is happening to me? What the fuck is happening? Mom? - Ah! What's so fucking funny? - You're the baby in the pictures! You're the baby with the knife! - No I'm not. I'm not! I'm not the baby! You're the fucking baby! - 911, what's your emergency? 911? Is anyone there? Hello? Hello? - My name is Abbey. I'm a single mom, and my son is a psychopath. - Are you in any danger right now, Abbey? - No. - Is your son in danger? - I killed him. I killed my son. - Is this a prank? - No. - All right. You said you killed your-- - Check the videos. It's all there. - Okay, all right. You're on East Wilcock, is that right? Ma'am? Ma'am, stay on the phone with me. Stay on the phone. Help is on the way, ma'am. Stay on the phone with me, help is on the way. Ma'am? Are you there? Stay on the phone with me, ma'am. Help is on the way. - Sike. You didn't think I actually wanted you to kill yourself, did you? Look, I saw that footage and I freaked out. Okay, I didn't know what to do and I guess I just wanted you to feel the way I felt. Okay? I know things went a little too far and I didn't mean to hurt you and I'm...
