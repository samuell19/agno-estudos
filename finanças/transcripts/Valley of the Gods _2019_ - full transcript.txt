Will you kill me As you're leaving? Erase my name, erase my face Take your sins and dreams Somewhere else And bury our love In a secret place Will you burn down your life To start all over again? Throw away my favorite dress The one that's hidden In your suitcase You turn red wine Into sweet blood You put me under your spell Under the moonlight Life was so intoxicating This is the death of a love To foretell You watched our love Shyly, slowly You turn red wine Into sweet blood Whoo! Ah! Hey! Ah! What are you doing? Are you all right, sir? Welcome to another edition of Navajo Nation News. Today we will be talking with Chief Tall Bitter Water about uranium crisis regarding our people. Also in studio, joining us, Chief Engineer from Wes Tauros Engineering Company, in charge of mineral extraction, Mr. John Previs. Chief? We call this yellow dirt, leetso. It's a monstrous layer... that poisons men's lungs and women's wombs. It's only harvest of a thousand abandoned uranium mines. Uh, your concerns, uh, Chief, are in the past. Uh, there are no tunnels involved now in our process. This is a completely safe and effective process and I can assure you that it risks no ones' life. Anything that man makes is not completely safe. Anything. Navajo men are dying of radiation-related diseases. Many sick ones are denied compensation. The United States Department of Justice delays and quibbles while the widows are married to their dead men. I can't speak for the United States Department of Justice, I can only speak for our company. Uh, and in speaking so, I can tell you that there is no statistic or scientific evidence to support your position. All you're doing with this protest is blocking your people from their ability to prosper. Without our company, where else is your economic growth going to come from? You... Your company will be making money from... And so will you, and that's the whole point. But that's not, that's not the point I'm trying to make. The point I'm trying to make is that we've lived here for many years. How have you lived? How? And how do you live? That's the question. - Yeah. Yeah. - And that is the way - that we know how to live. - Hey, get it? - Joining us via live - Shut up. is John Kazubowski. - Shut the fuck up! - John, you've heard what's happening here in the studio. What are your comments? What I could gather here from BLM people, the sale of Valley of The Gods to Wes Tauros is completed. And Tauros Engineering has a green light to move their equipment in. Wes Tauros will not get our land. Our gods will never allow it. Bring us the dough, man. Bird Face must know. Whoa, whoa, whoa. The Valley of The Gods is the foot of our mountains. What are we gonna do if we turn the Valley over to them? Hey! Oh. If somebody takes everything out from your legs, how can you stand up? Grandpa, these are just fairytales. Shut the fuck up! Hey! - What are you doing? - You're so beautiful. Sweetgrass. And you can't even give me my son. Hi. It's been a long time You're just as lovely Can I get something to drink? As you used to be How's your new life? How much is it? Means so much to me What's that, darlin'? How am I doin'? I'm doin' all right Except I can't sleep And I cry all night Till dawn What I'm trying... You... You want to fuck us good, huh? And if you should ever Find it in your heart To forgive me Come back, darlin' I'll be waiting for you You'll be okay. Grab me on both sides and we step back. Whoo! Whoo! Whoo! You, you fantasize about your life and in the meantime, we don't even have a child. Every week, it's the same thing with you. I, I, I need to concentrate. I'm a writer. I am an artist. You don't even use a cellphone, you don't use a computer. You... You live in a fantasy world and I live in the real one. And last week, I really, I really felt... I felt free. Like I could see myself in the world from a different perspective. I could fly. Ah. It was a dream birthday gift. Yes, I know. Uh... And thank you for that. Who is that? Hi. - Can you help me? - Ah. Stop. I see, okay fine. Well, then, maybe don't come back. All right? That's all. Bye, John. We should emphasize that Tauros Engineering's technologies supplies carbon-free power. Over the last century, we have been enslaved by oil and other fossil fuels. In our campaign, we have to stress that oil is the past. Uranium is the future. The buzzwords to stick to are "safe and reliable energy‚Äù as well as "promoting jobs and security in a struggling Navajo community." Excuse me, John. This is your job. You were supposed to do it. You're the copywriter. Do you think there could be a positive side to this? Hm? You're now free to do all the things that you ever wanted to do. Perhaps you could write that novel. You remember that wonderful story you told me about the richest man on the planet? And those crazy Navajo legends. You remember that? But I can't do anything right now. Don't you understand? Anything. Well, you must do something. Go back to your paying job or take a cruise around the Caribbean? You must find something to occupy your mind. Maybe do a PhD in baseball statistics. Whatever it takes. But you must not sit at home and do nothing. Why not? It feels good, waiting for the final quake to wipe this goddamned place out. You must overcome this fear of being outside. Walk through your fears to conquer fear. That's what the, uh, the mystics say. Try doing something that you're afraid of doing and then... you will lose your fear of it. Bullshit. I'm afraid to jump from the tenth floor, so I'm supposed to jump to beat that fear? Do not exaggerate what I'm saying to an absurd proportion. But everything's absurd. This city, politics, entertainment, sports... Have you noticed the black sun that's shining over LA? It's not white, yellow, or gold, it's blindingly black. And you know why? Because it shines over the land of the dead, who roam it entombed in their cars. And when they get a moment to themselves, they line up to watch a movie with a guy flying about in the air. Every Bond or Cruise in it jumps from the tenth floor every couple of minutes and somehow lands safely. Doesn't even bust his tendon. And people buy that. John, let me ask you a question. Why is it that you cannot live with the absurdity of this? Like the rest of mankind. Or is it that you want to conduct a war against the absurd? In which case, try to outdo it. If you want to destroy the sense of absurdity, use the absurd. Meaning? Well... do something that makes no sense to you. Take all your pots and pans for a hike. Walk backwards, go out into the deserts and talk to the rocks. Do whatever you need to do, but... John, do it. In your world of admirers Lovers, and hangers on Bathroom mirrors, ghosts And fleeting friends Your SOSs Your emotional messes And your dramas without end Your victories, wardrobe full of clothes you never wear A vase of daffodils in your window It's here I met graveyard Of my dreams The ones I didn't wanna know Buried in the darkness Sitting naked in your chair Ah! Oh. So what's life like just sitting here? I've seen you here before. Is this your favorite spot? This is the worst spot. The worst spot? Why? I lost my women there. This is everything I got. Get some food. Thank you. My baby. My baby... will get you all. Don't be afraid. Come closer. Lower your head. We need to scan your eye. We know everything about you. ...believe that the future belongs to young people, and the imagination to create a better world. Whoo! Don't worry, sir. They won't harm you. Mr. Tauros is very pleased that you have honored him with your presence, sir. I hope that sir shall like it here. We have a modest room reserved for sir, sheets of paper arranged the way sir likes them, and a fountain pen. We know how sir hates writing on computers. How do you know so much about me? Oh, before we admit anyone into Mr. Tauros's residence, we take every possible precaution. I'm sure you are aware of how many pitfalls await the world's richest man. And Mr. Tauros does not like armies of security guards. That would drive him to suicide like his idol, Elvis. Can you imagine that, sir? Poor Elvis sitting day and night in Graceland with his henchmen, and what was there to do? He just ate, got fat, and wasted his voice on mundane conversations about the narrow horizons of his protectors... Mr. Tauros loves art and had statues made of all the people who were or are dear to him. If he likes you, sir, perhaps your likeness shall find a place here. Who's that singing so beautifully? Ah, that is Madame Norman. She's preparing a concert for Mr. Tauros. And that, sir, is Madame Sara. Mr. Tauros's beloved wife. She is with Leelee, Mr. Tauros's daughter. Sadly, they both died in a car accident. This is your room, sir. I do hope you like it. And here are some loose leaves, as you like them. And a fountain pen. Mont Blanc, like yours. Yes, pen is good. Has blood. Blue blood. Is there anything else you would like, sir? No. Should hit the sack. In that case, sir, I shall turn up your bed. Good night, sir. Good night. Laura! No! No! Ooh... The first man brought soil from the hole in the sky, and he planted our mountains. And he covered them with a sheet of daylight. And he covered them with some grey clouds. And all the mountains, he nailed down with the sharpest of the rainbow. For when the mountains walk, earth trembles. Give me back my son. Take him. See if you can. It's based on the J. Paul Getty's release form. Sign here, please. You must be feeling very lucky. Why? After all, you've been selected from among 273 applicants. You have very similar features. The same neckline, breasts, hands. Sign here, please. I'm doing it just for my son. - How old is he? - Eight. I have to get him back. You will, you will. What kind of stone is this? That's the stone of my son. Of your son? Yes. From his kidney. She's ready, sir. What's this? A museum. A museum of poverty. In his teens, Mr. Tauros wandered aimlessly across the country. He was so hungry, he ate reeds. Yes. He got to Las Vegas, lived in a hovel. Somewhere on the Strip, he found a paper bag full of dollar bills. I guess he had luck with it. Wes Tauros? Wes Tauros indeed. These pieces of junk are more precious to him than the finest Venetian china. The famous... Wes Tauros. What would you like me to do? Madame, you should lay face down. You're staying? Yes, Madame. For a threesome? Please, Madame, don't be vulgar. Lie face down. What would she do? Fucking hey, man! What are you doing? You're violating our holy place! Do you know what this is? This is our fathers' holy resting place. And you just woke them up. Do you know what that means? - Hey, Grey Horse, come on. - Huh? Grey Horse. "Our fathers"? Since when did you care about this stuff, huh, man? In a few days, this won't be a resting place anymore. Get it? Fuck you, Bird Face. - Yeah, fuck you too. - Who are you? Reservation Police. Are you okay? Never been better. Show me your driving license. Well, it's... It's burned. Maybe, I don't know. God! Goddamn it, fuck! You're under arrest then. Frisk him. Get up. Let's see what we got here. Credit cards. Four hundred bucks. A lot. Keep the cash, keep the car. Keep whatever you want, just leave me alone, please. Are you trying to bribe the law enforcement officers? Hey, book him. Feel like he just stunk up the whole freaking valley. Fucking great. Got Laura Ecas, attorney at law. Is she your lawyer? 'Cause you're gonna need one. She's my wife. Tauros loves to hear singing. He's been silent all his life. No. I heard it was since his wife and kid's death. When will Tauros finally arrive? You never know if he's going to show up to anything. He's buying Navajo Country for their uranium ore. He may no longer be the world's richest man. Sound like he's been overtaken, I've heard. You're supposed to be dead. I saw your sculpture in the garden. Really? Apparently, you died in a car accident, along with your daughter. I don't have a daughter, just a son. And he's fine. A few people have already mistaken me for Tauros's wife. But you look exactly like her. Madame, I'd like to invite you to the garden for the catapult display. You were supposed to introduce me to Mr. Tauros. That is why I'm here, sir. May I offer you my arm, Madame? Thank you, I'll stay here. But I insist, Madame. I'm not in the mood. Madame, do you know what mood spelled backward is? And now if you will excuse me, we have a surprise for you. Honored guests, ladies and gentlemen. Mr. Tauros welcomes you all most cordially and is delighted that so many of you have come. For the requirements of this evening, a team of engineers led by Mr. Tauros himself have built a catapult. What are you doing here? ...in 500 years of... Same as you. I was invited. ...of Leonardo da Vinci. Maybe Mr. Tauros wanted to meet someone who writes about him. Mm. And you need some spice? In a moment, we shall see whether it works as we attempt to fire from it a certain superfluous item from the famed Tauros collection. This is the Phantom V, in which Queen Elizabeth rode during her royal visit to Bermuda. And here is our host himself, Mr. Wes Tauros. I'm scared. Don't be. This catapult's solid. It's not the catapult, stupid. It's this Bluebeard's castle. He locks his guests in cages and turns them into stone. Let's go. I'm sorry, I can't. My wife will be here soon. You won't get out of here on your own either. Idiot. Who's there? Laura. What are you doing here? Because you're still my husband. I don't want you doing anything stupid. Did you bring your desk out here? Our desk. John, stop. - I love you so much. - No, stop. I miss you. I missed you. No... The rock grew as tall as a tower and it reached the temples of the gods. Dusk covered the windows. Darkness covered the houses. And the gods lacked breath, as did the sheep in the fold. The sleeping rock has taken all the rain clouds and put them in his head. For when the black storm comes, the sleeping rock will awaken to avenge his people. Here in the center, your spirit lives. The green spots are sacred mountains. The yellow, cities that eat our land. Do you hear? It's the wind that gives us life. The very wind that comes out of our mouths when we breathe and speak. When it ceases to blow inside us, it can make us speechless, so that we die. All the stones hold the breaths of those who lie underneath. No! What did you tell them? Huh? How am I gonna see my child now? It's your fault. My fault? They accused me of telling you the details. Details of what? How am I meant to communicate with him if he's mute? There are many ways of communicating, sir. As a writer, you should know that well. I'm sure you've heard of the Taj Mahal. On the other side of the river was to stand a twin Taj Mahal, but a black one. That didn't happen 350 years ago, so now maybe I'll put it there. I'm awaiting permission from the Indian government. You speak. Well, you should know, you write about me. You've kept it absolutely secret. Not at all. We spoke before, remember? - That was you? - Yes. - At the crossroads? - Yes. Yes. I exist as two people. At least two. A public and a private. Some people create their avatars in a virtual world, I created mine in a real one. And I use my double for public functions, just like Howard Hughes. Howard Hughes didn't have a double. Oh, yes, he did. This guy who wandered around two floors of a hotel in Las Vegas wearing Kleenex boxes. Didn't particularly look like him. Meanwhile, the real Hughes was tending his garden on Martinique. I suspect you live a double life as well. Now most of us do. We are the masters of fiction in our lives. Hughes thought up the idea of a double, so he could live in peace, but I can only feel peaceful when I'm reduced to nothing and lying in my grave. What mattered most to Hughes was his garden. To me, it's my own debt. And buying Navajo land. Valley of the Gods, to be precise. And not to buy, but to open it up for mineral exploitation. Uranium. Toxic stuff. Mm. Mm-hm. Why do you keep your guests imprisoned? I am trying to help these lost souls get back to themselves. But tell me, why are you here? What exactly do you hope to find out? Simply? What does it mean to be the world's richest man? What is it to have all that power? To be able to do... anything. Do anything? Despite what you may think, very little. Money only complicates things. Regardless of how much money I have, I can't bring back my wife... or my daughter. Rather it's you who has the power, and with a stroke of a pen, you can... disarm, or maim, or Kill... or open all the cages. Do you want to? Whoo-hoo-hoo! May your fertility flow onto the soil, and your strength let us make new soil. Holy soil, mountain soil. Mother Snake twists around the mountain bed. People howl through the night like coyotes in cages. May the sickness of your head turn to cloud and go to heaven. May the sickness from your hand the black earth take. Whatever sickness she has, take away, grandpa. Now the sun is risen, and ll am woman. I wear my heart where my people can see it. I had bled for centuries of love. None of it wasted, none of it lost.
