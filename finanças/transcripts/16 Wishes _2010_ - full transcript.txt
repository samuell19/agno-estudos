It's going to go on our family Web page. - No. - Come on sweetheart. Make a wish. Okay. You know what I wish? I wish my dear sweet family would finally understand they can't just barge into my room any time they want. I'm not a kid anymore. I need privacy and boundaries. I need my own space. I've been looking forward to this day all my life and now that it's here I wish you would all just get out and stop spoiling it. Love you. I don't know. Ow. Ow. Ow! Eww. I'm 16 finally. Today is going to be... magical. Told you she wouldn't like it. I don't understand her. She's probably nervous about her Sweet 16 party. Oh Bob the party lights. They're in the garage. I'm on it. Wow. Thanks. Ah-ah. It's for your sister. Too yellow. Too blue. Too pink. Too nighttime. Too daytime. Too... Fifteen. Perfect. Hey Abs. Hello. Knock much? What?

When I'm 16 I'll have the best party ever. Hey that's private. Yeah not really. You honestly thought you'd get all this today? I'm an essentially hopeful person. The first one's hilarious. When I'm 16, I'll meet Joey Lockhart. V Joey Lockhart. He's an international pop star with about a bazillion fans. Why would you even wish that? - I was 7. - You were delusional. You were 5 and wore a cape to school. The other wishes are more realistic... like... wish number 3. I'll... decorate my room the way I want. No no no. Sassy. Mm. N-N-Not a good idea Abs. Why not? If you decorate your room the way you dress... ouch. Ucch. And what's with the mug shot on 16? It's not a mug shot. It's Logan Buchanan. Your crushed on the quarterback? How can you say. For your information he's also in the drama club and once attended Chess Masters. I know. I was there. He wanted to buy my chem notes. He's perfect. And if I get my wish he'll talk to me today. Aah! Ha ha ha! Ohh. Krista Cook. Cool car. It's perfect! I love it! It's not cool. It's terrible. I don't know what I did to deserve this. Why was Krista of all people born on the same day I was? Yeah that must be annoying how she always gets better stuff than you for her birthday. ♪ Ohh... ♪ I don't know why she hates me so much.

How long will it take to get them out? Several days. A year at the most. A year? Oh. I managed to save this. Ohh. This can't be happening not to me, not today. Daddy I left some clothes in my gym locker. Please please please drive me to school. I don't think so Pumpkin. Sweet. Hey Krista. Hey can I ride? Hop in. Buckle up. Great. I'll just take the bus. By myself on my birthday. Hmm. Here. Mm. Thanks Jay. You look pathetic. Nice to know I can count on you to state the obvious. Sorry about your house. How'd you know? Krista texted the entire junior class. That's just peachy. What's this? Happy Birthday? Not really. Come on. It's beautiful Jay. Where's the other half? Best friends forever. Oh Jay that's sweet. Do you like it? I love it. It's the best thing that's happened to me all day. That bad huh? Yes. I've been planning for this day for eight years. I mean this was supposed to be the day I started acquiring all of the wonderful things that come with being grown up... things like freedom and privacy and respect. But what do I get? Wasps. Wasps. Even my backyard is infested. Where am I going to have my Sweet 16 party? You could use my basement. Ew. No. All right. Well the day is young. Good things could still happen. Like what? Like taking the bus? I hate taking the bus. This is the worst birthdays in the history of birthdays. Today wasn't supposed to be like this. Today was supposed to be... magical. Abigail Jensen? Y- Y-Yes. This is for you. Happy Birthday sweetie. - Don't open it. - Why? Real mail is delivered to your house not your bus stop. So? It could be a bomb. It's not a bomb. It's a birthday present. And I'm opening it. "Make a wish light a candle and watch your Sweet 16 birthday wishes come true." Great. Candles. Not even a stupid gift card. Wait there's something else. Hold this. What are you doing? Read wish number 8. "When I'm 16..." I'll have my own car, preferably RED. I'm lighting one of these candles. What if something bad happens? What if something good happens? And look if it's a joke the worst that can happen is we take the bus. Here. Ladies and gentlemen Joey Lockhart! You Abby Jensen?

I've had a crush on him since I was 7. When I'm 16 I'll meet Joey Lockhart. What are you talking about? It's wish number 1. Look Jay. The candles work. Yeah but we're still stuck taking the bus. Maybe not. I lit candle number 1 and wish number 1 on my list came true. I think the numbers on the candles correspond with the numbers on my wish list. Give me number 8. When I'm 16 I'll have my own car preferably red. No way. Way. Check it out. Gosh this is fun. I can't believe it. This is my dream car. It's all yours sweetie. Want to drive? Yes. No. Come on. I have my permit. My dad lets me practice in the Hasty Mart parking lot all the time. Yeah at midnight when it's empty. Abby when a total stranger drives up to you on the street and offers you a car you can't just take it. She's not a total stranger. You look very familiar. Well we're not doing this. Why not? Yeah why not? Because... you don't have a driver's license until you take the test after school. Good point. I'll drive. You two get in. What? Not until you tell us who you are. I'm Celeste. I'm here to make Abby's 16 wishes come true. Oh. Well that explains pretty much exactly nothing. Come on Jay. This is the most wonderful amazing magical thing that's ever happened to me. 50 years from now when you're looking back at your life don't you want to be able to say you had the guts to get in the car? I'm going to regret this. Yes! Get your stuff. Come on. Get in the car. All right go go go. Just so we're clear you're some kind of magical being like an elf or a fairy? Sure. Why not? - You don't sound so sure. - Jay. You just do birthdays or other events too? He babbles when he's nervous. Why don't you relax Jay and enjoy the ride? Hold on. Yahoo! Whoa! Mommy! Whoo! That was awesome. Have we landed yet? What's it look like? - What does what look like? - Her home planet. Sorry Jay. The only alien planet you'll be visiting today is high school. I already have my license. My dad has connections at the DMV. Yo Logan check out that ride. Hey Jensen did you get new wheels too? Uh... Yeah. These are my new wheels which I bought myself for my birthday which is today. Cool. No way this is yours. What can I say? I'm a saver not a spender like you. Oh man. I got to make some bank. Umm... What are you doing? Saving you from more humiliation. What? I'm not humiliated. This is the best birthday ever. Look. Wish number 15. When I'm 16 I'll have the best party ever. If the candles keep working like this my party's going to be sick. Hey party tonight at my house. You're all invited. It's okay Come on. Come on. It's okay. It's okay. Want to make some cash? Yes. Put these up everywhere. Meet me at the voting table after first period. ♪♪ Okay. You go find some real clothes to wear. I'll tell Miss Hackl you got a late time. - Okay! - Thanks Jay. Ugh. Ew. When I'm 16... I'll have cutest clothes in school. For me? Thank you. Okay. Wish number 2. All right. Okay. What? What's going on? Come on. Uh Miss Duffy. Jensen. I'll take that. Keep it up Theodore and you'll be president one day. You really think so? Absolutely. Ohh! So you can tell the future too? Oh no. Just gave Ted hope. Come on in. So what's up sweetie? What's up? You know what's up. That's why you're here pretending to be the counselor. Why didn't that stupid candle light? Because of the rules. The rules? Oh boy. You don't get out much do you? What are you talking about? The candles are magic and all magic has rules. One candle and one wish per hour. You lit candle number 1 at 7:58 this morning and Joey Lockhart showed up. Then you lit candle number 8 at precisely 8 A.M. Your wishes were two minutes apart but within different hours. Oh. So now I have to wait... - 27 minutes. -... - before I make another wish. Great. You could have printed that on the box you know. Any other magic candle rules I should know about? Only one but it's a doozy. The magic in the candles expires at midnight tonight so no more wishes after then. Oh and all the wishes you've made by then become permanent. At midnight. Yeah. So at midnight that gorgeous car out there is mine forever? Absolutely. And in 261/2 minutes I'll have cuter clothes than Krista Cook. Yeah. She really can't stand you. Oh. You know about that? I shouldn't do this but... Read for yourself. ♪ Oh yeah ♪ Oh, no. I couldn't. Well maybe just a page or two. I suggest 1023 and 37. Oh. Be a little more careful where you light those puppies. Thanks. Hmm. Whoa. Good stuff? You have no idea. Thanks for voting for me. Krista! I know you've loathed me since we were 8 years old but I didn't know you've been keeping score. Where did you get that? From the Birthday Fairy. Right. Give it to me. When we were 10 I had my first sleepover so you decided to have one too but you paid everybody to come to yours. You have no right to read that. It's mine. Well then why is it all about me? When we were 12, I entered the school talent show with my baton twirling act. So you entered too juggling 12 batons. Every year you' competed with me and every year you've won. You've tortured me since the grade. Can you just give it a rest? Don't play innocent with me. You know what you did. And for this I'm going to make sure nobody comes to your party. Here. What's this? It's an invitation to my Sweet 16 birthday party tonight. Everybody's going to be there. Now if you'll excuse me I have some campaigning to do. Krista you don't need to campaign. You're the only name on the ballot running for president. Well then I'm sure to win. Why are you doing this? You're not even interested in student government. And you are? - Well I... - I didn't think so. Ahem. Hey Krista. So they said you needed help with something? Hand these out for me. Sure. Thanks. She's doing it. She's ruining my birthday. Again. Just don't let her get to you. You're right Jay. I'm going to put an end to her reign of terror. Right about now. List. Hurry. When I'm 16 I'll have the cutest clothes in school. Hi-hi. Celeste it's beautiful. I know right? I've been waiting for you to make this wish. I just love shopping especially when it's free. I don't even know where to start. That's what I'm here for. Now close your eyes and let me work my magic. Ever since the third grade whatever I did Krista did better. She's never satisfied unless she's winning and I'm losing. But today I decided she's t going to make me miserable anymore. I have a plan and this wish it's the first part. Would you say Krista Cook always has the cutest clothes in school? And shoes and handbags. Not anymore. That top is not an original you-know-who is it? It is. Shut up. Oh those shoes are so to die for. I hate you. Want to have lunch near us? Sure. Yay. I totally just want to sit next to that handbag. You mean this handbag? I got it for my birthday last year. You're not all that Jensen. Yoo-hoo Abby! I'm so sorry. Give me that old thing. This one's so hot it hasn't even come out yet. Thank you so much. I'll just ship you the rest of the collection when the infestation's over. Auf Wiedersehen. I know what you're doing and it's not going to work. I'm just trying to have the best birthday of my entire life. Well good luck with that because it's not over yet. All right everybody. On the track in five. Late again Jensen. Yes, Miss Duffy, I am late. I had to go back to my locker for this. I see. That's still no excuse for tardiness but that is a beautiful bag. It's for you. - Me? - Mm-hmm. I was saving it for your Christmas present but look it matches your track suit perfectly. Ha ha! It actually does. Happy Monday. Well Happy Monday to me. Well ladies what do you say instead of running killer laps we all have a nice friendly game of volleyball? Way to go Abby. Come on. We need her. Jensen! Get out here!

Yeah that's so true. That's so true. - Makes my day. - Yeah. You wanted to see me Mr. Smith? Yeah. Yeah. Ms. Cook, the election's over. How can it be over? A lot of people haven't voted yet. Actually we had a 100% voter turnout. Whoop! Ooh! What's going on here? Good morning students! I'm very pleased to announce the winner of the most votes for the Student Body President is Abby Jensen! Yes! I just want to thank everyone who voted for me and made this dream possible. No. It's not possible. Her name isn't even on the ballots! Let... go. That is all. Whoa. Wow. You all right? Abby was a write-in. Better luck next time Krista. Ha! I finally beat Krista Cook. Had a little help. I know. Isn't it amazing? This day just keeps getting better and better. Yeah for you. I know right? ♪ Oi ♪ ♪ Java ♪ ♪ Oi ♪ Can we just do this experiment? We both need extra credit. Nah. I'll just give the teacher some strappy sandals and a pashmina. No. Just give it a rest.

And now all of a sudden you're Student Body President? What can I say? The people spoke and they wanted me. The candles spoke and you have no idea what you just wished for. Yes I do. Being president is like an honor. Being president is an important job Abby. It should do to someone who really wants it. Oh like who? Like Krista? No. Well I'm sure I'll do just fine. I'll have you to help me. Come on. You can't be mad at me. Why not? Because it's my birthday. Because we're best friends. Because I'm Student Body President and I get free lunch. Ta-da! Ah! No way. Ah! Way way. Every day. Now hand over your goofy glasses and let your commander in chief buy you a sandwich. What kind of sandwich? Any kind you want. Come on. There she is! You see? Ha ha.

Not to rain on your birthday parade Abs but Vegas? That's not really your style. And your basement is? Hey I have foosball. Good point. Look this is my one and only Sweet 16 birthday party. I...

Aw, that's sweet. But we're kind of busy right now. Your turn dear. What's the use? 22 cards in my hand and I still can't play! Can't this wait? Of course it can. What's up? Aah! Well um... I have something important to discuss with you and I thought if you really listen to me... you might... understand. Bob. What? I'm listening. We're listening. Even if it sounds crazy? I listen to your father all the time. What's that supposed to mean? Go on sweetheart. When I woke up this morning I was 16 years old. I thought this was going to be the best day of my life. And then, this Birthday Fairy appeared and gave me these. Would you look at this hon. Well that brings back memories doesn't it? What? What memories? Your father took me to the Lucky Duck Chinese Restaurant on the night you were born. I had the orange chicken. We thought it was an omen. We always felt so lucky to have a daughter as wonderful as you are. Really? Really. Then you'll understand when I say... I need to come back and live with you and go back to school.. I'm not ready to have my own apartment and my own job. Please tell me you understand. Abby... look behind you. Ever since you were a little girl all you wanted was to be exactly what you are now. Beautiful and independent. I remember the day this photo was taken. You wanted a grown-up birthday party. All dressed up in my high heels and pearls. You were never happier. But being grown up is different than dreaming about it isn't it? Yes. We understand you. You do? Of course. You're scared your childhood is over and with it - all the best times of your life. - Yes! You probably want to just turn back the clock and start over. Yes! Yes! That's exactly what I want to do! - We know how that feels - Yeah! So, then I'm still your little girl? You'll always be our little girl Pumpkin... Ow! Ah! Look! Wasps! Time to go Pumpkin. Drive safe. What? And don't forget these. But... I thought you guys understood. We do understand Adulthood could be tough. Sometimes it gets a little buggy. Bye now sweetheart! - Love you! - Love you! So that's what that feels like. Hi Logan. Hey. Cool ride. Yeah. You said that this morning. Huh? So... what are you doing here? Party. Right. I wasn't invited. Huh. - Hey! - Yeah? - Will you do something for me? - Sure. Take a picture of me with your car. Auw!

You're my best friend and it's my 16th birthday and I got these magic candles at the bus stop and this big car pulled up and Joey Lockhart got out - and kissed me... - I-I-I don't know her. Okay!? You were there! You saw him! Let go. Not until you listen to me. Give me five minutes. Four. Okay. I know this is hard to believe, but we're best friends and I can prove it. So? Look at your key ring. "Happy Sweet 16. Love Jay." You gave this to me this morning. For my 16th birthday. Abby. You remember? I think so. So, you believe me? Yeah. I do. He believes me! Wh-Whoa. Volume. This doesn't change anything. And when midnight comes I'm stuck like this forever. Here lemme see the list. Here ya go. Okay. You've used 1,2... 7,8,9... - Skip ahead. I can't believe you wasted a wish on sushi. I was 8. I had a very unsophisticated palate. Had? You're a great best friend, Jay. I know. Okay. C'mon. Okay. So, Most of these are kind of useless since you're already an adult. That leaves 15 and Logan Buchanan... - Yeah about that... 15 was always my favorite. "When I'm 16 I'll have the best party ever." But... you're not 16 anymore. Hey. I... kinda have to make an appearance at Krista's party. Do you, maybe... want to come with me? Not as my date or anything. No. Of course not. Well? I'd love to go with you, Jay. Okay. Great party. Ladies first. Mike? Give a shout-out to my big sis Abby everybody. You're super old Abs but you're still cool! So Mike can really play? Yeah. Something just clicked with him this year. He got serious about playing guitar. He's getting paid really well for this gig. Wait. Did I miss something? I mean besides senior year? Jay you're here! Hi! I'm so glad you could make it! Yeah. I'm... I'm Abby Jensen. I know silly. We're neighbors? Yes. Neighbors. Your party looks awesome. Thanks to your parents. They found all these amazing decorations in their garage after their house was infested by wasps. I guess they were left over from your Sweet 16 Party but never got used for some reason. Any way, they just gave them to me! Lucky you. I know right? Oh! And you're just in time for the big celebration. Thanks for coming everybody! Man this is a dream come true for me. What's happening? Jay Kepler ladies and gentlemen. Our new Student Body President! Thank you. I want to recognize my campaign manager Krista Cook. What all of you don't know is that I really wanted this but I was too afraid to try. I couldn't have done it without your help Krista. Thank you so much! - 1234... Have fun okay? - Mm-hmm. So you're Student Body President? Yep. I was Student Body President. Oh! Yeah. Weird. I thought with me out of the way Krista would win for sure. Krista? She's hates competition. Krista? Our Krista. Yeah. I think without you in her life she, just didn't have a reason to compete for anything. She's... kind super helpful a good listener and a great friend. You guys would like each other.

I didn't order a pizza. I know. I just thought you could use a friend. Oh sweetie. Dry those tears. I'm starving. You are? Sure us... magical beings have to eat too. This day didn't go like I thought it would. I can't believe I wasted my wishes on things like beating Krista Cook. Yeah. She's pretty nice now that she is not out to destroy you. Don't rub it in. She's a really good friend to Jay. Better than I was. I didn't even know he wanted to be Student Body President. How could I have been so thoughtless? All I could think about was... having parties and clothes and popularity. I can't believe those things were so important to me. You were 16. But I didn't appreciate it. Ever since I was little I wanted to grow up. I thought it was the only way to get what I wanted. I guess I didn't realize what I already had. You still have this little number. Wish 16. All those years I saved it for something really special. Of all the wishes on this list this is the one I wish I could change. Wow that gum is still really fresh. Maybe the rules don't know about gum. There's only one way to find out. I wish I could start this whole day over again. Surprise! Happy Birthday Abby. Look. Your first 16th birthday picture. Oh! This is a great picture! This is the best picture I've ever seen in my entire life! Thank you thank you thank you! You're welcome Pumpkin. Make a wish sweetheart? I wish for exactly this. Everything is perfect. Wasps! Yeah. I saw one crawl up the AC vent. No not one. Thousands! Nesting up there for 16 years! Sweetheart we know. No you don't know. You can't possibly know that the house is going to be totally infested and the wasps will take over the cars and you and Dad'll have to live in the driveway but then... Joey Lockhart will come and kiss me and I will get candles and wishes and... some really gorgeous clothes and everything will look like it will be okay. But then I will make a really stupid wish that I didn't mean to make and I will have to grow up and live alone and miss my party and this will turn into the worst 16th birthday in the history of 16th birthdays! You have to call the exterminator now! Okey dokey. All done. Whoo that was some wasps' nest. Celeste? Hi Abby. You know her. Yeah we just met this morning. When Abby called me. You're very lucky I showed up when I did. So the wasps are all gone. Like they never happened. Everything is going to be okay? Better than okay. Wait. What do I owe ya? Consider it a Sweet 16 gift. Happy Birthday Abby. Thank you. For everything. Go on down and start making that special birthday breakfast you have planned for me Mom. I'll be right there. ♪ Da na na da na na now! ♪ ♪ Da na na da na na now! ♪ Hey! This is for you. I was saving it for my Sweet 16 party but I think you need it more. Whoa! For what? A real guitar. I think you're really talented. Thank you Abs. I love you Mike. Thanks for the yummy breakfast Mom and Dad. Love you! - Love you too. - Love you too. Krista! Krista! Wait! Get back. We need to talk. I have nothing to say to you. I have one quick question. No you cannot have a ride. I don't want a ride. I want to understand. What did I ever do to you? Go away. No. Not until you answer me. Why don't you like me? You really don't know do you? Not a clue. It was in third grade. Jay and I were best friends. Then you moved to town. It was my birthday. Jay and I made a pact... Cheese! Best friends forever! Yeah! I stole your best friend. On my birthday. After that Jay and I did everything together. Without me. That must have been so horrible for you. It was. I can't imagine how you felt. How I felt? I felt... like a loser. Krista, if I could turn back the clock and change that day I would. I am so sorry. You are? Any chance you can forgive me? I don't know. I made my own vow that day. Which was... I vowed to win at everything so you'd never get anything you wanted ever again. Wow. You did a great job. Thank you. Hey, imagine if you used your powers for good instead of evil. Like what? Do you really want to be Student Body President? Honestly? No. It's exhausting having to win all the time. Well, If you want to drop out I know somebody who would love to take your place. Hey Krista. Hey Abby! Boys. Cool ride! Thanks! Weird. You're a terrible best friend. - No I'm not. - Yes you are. I had to take the bus by myself. Where were you? I got a ride. You two. In one vehicle. And it didn't like explode? Nope. We have a surprise for you. Why? It's not my birthday. - No it's mine... - And mine... And all we want is for your dream to come true. What dream? You're now the only person running for Student Body President. So you'll win for sure. Think so? - Absolutely. - Absolutely. Jay Kepler ladies and gentlemen. Our new... Student Body President! Go Jay! Thanks everybody. Let's hear it for the hosts of this little party Abby and Krista! Happy Sweet 16 to the both of you - Look who's here. - Huh? Look! Logan Buchanan, he's so gorgeous! You really like him don't you? Yeah. I thought you liked him to make me suffer. Making you suffer was a bonus but I would have liked him anyway. Well... I happen to know he really likes you too. - Really? - Really. Go talk to him. About what? Ask him about the red sports car he wants to drive someday. Okay. - Hi! Logan. - Hi. Thanks a lot for coming. Thanks. You look great. You too. Happy Birthday Abby. Yes it is.
