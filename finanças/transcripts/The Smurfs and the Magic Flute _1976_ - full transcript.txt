Once upon a time... No, no, it wasn't once upon a time. This story takes place in the Middle Ages, that's all. Alright. So this story takes place in the Middle Ages. On that day, there was a great festival being held in the kingdom. The tournament's starting! Hurry up... We can't miss it! Hurray! Hurray! I've won! I've won! But you, Sire, you've lost your bet. You've lost, Sire. Oh? Hmm. I thank you, Your Majesty. Ah, there's Johan. He's the one who'll be carrying my colors in the next contest. And who will this young boy have to face? Johan? He'll be jousting with The Black Knight. Here he comes now. Sire, would you consent to bet with me? I'd like to put 10 crowns on The Black Knight. Hmm... Alright, it's agreed. What happened? Where am I? Hurray! We downed him! We downed hi! Victory! Hip, hip, hurray! Giddy-up! Now tell me, Sire, who is this...? Ah, yes, of course. Excuse me. But who is that odd little man? Pirlouit? Yes, he's a funny little chap, isn't he?! For example, he thinks that he's... ...that he's a musician... and... Oh no! And what's more, he sings! Noble lords and gentle ladies... Hear the moving and triumphal ballad... ...which celebrates the win of my friend, the gallant Johan. Now you must all believe... with a crash and a bang and a fall. Now you must all believe that into battle with Johan... ...that into battle with Johan.... ...you really can get hurt with a crash and a bang and a fall. You really can get hurt if you fight the old quintain... ...if you fight the old quintain. With colors flying proud, with a crash and a bang and a fall. With colors flying... ...to fight the great Black Knight. The great black knight. If this ode has brought you joy with a crash... ...and a bang and a fall. If this ode has brought you joy, I'll sing it all over again. I'll sing it all over again. Sire. Sire, I've been told a merchant has arrived at the castle. Do you wish to see him? A merchant? Yes, I do! Wait for me. I'm coming. No, no, no. Sir Pirluit is the one I want to see. I have a few little things here that will interest him very, very, much. You have things to sell to Pirlouit? Yes, Sire. That is correct, Sire... to Pirlouit. Very well... Go and fetch him, at once. Right away, sir. Well, what's that? Can you eat it? No. It would be indigestible. But wait, I'll show you. You won't believe your eyes, when you see this little wonder. But I shan't keep you in suspense any longer. Enough babble, gaggle and prattle... Look at these splendid objects! And the prices...! My prices are cheaper than any competitor. Like this, for example, it's a harp from Ireland... ...with cedar-wood embellishments. Oh, but just listen to these melodious chords. In addition... this beautiful example, with its mellow sound. So mellow! And this lute, which sings like an angel. And this... this... I've forgotten what you call it. But it sure makes a lot of noise, eh? I also have a... a hurdy gurdy... a triangle... and a, uh, a flute. Shameful! You're crazy! Don't you realize...? Pack all this up! Hurry up, or else...! Scram! Get out of here! If ever you're fool enough to come back... ...with your filthy rubbish, I'll have you hanged! Phew! We had a narrow escape. I believe the merchant wants to see me. So where's this merchant? Well, the fact is... Exactly. I think he wanted to compliment you on your... musical abilities. But as he was in a great hurry, he had to leave. And so that's the way it is. Oh, what a shame...! A shame for him, anyway. I would have played him my new dawn serenade. I performed it last night, remember? And guess why it was so melodious. Because I attached a new mute to my instrument. And you, Sire, what do you think of... Oh, Sire. You've fallen down. Are you hurt? Not at all. Wait, Sire... I'll help you up. Leave me alone... I don't want to get up. I'm very happy as I am. But Sire, you're not really going to stay there, on the ground, are you? And why not? Why, it's very, very comfortable on the ground. Yes, very comfortable. I even think I'll take a little nap. Pirlouit, go and fetch me a royal cushion for my royal head. I'll run, Sire. No, no, Johan, not you. I said Pirlouit. Pirlouit, you go. Me? But why me? Because I ...! Go on... Be quick about it! Hurry up, Pirlouit. Phew, he's gone. Quick, help me up. You don't want to sleep anymore? Don't talk nonsense! Does one usually sleep on the ground? Yes, just now, you said you wanted to. Yes, but that was then... not now. Pirlouit was here. Hm, just look at what I was lying on. A flute. It must have fallen off that confounded merchant's wagon. We must destroy it. Come, come, there's still a fire in my room. We'll use that. And what's more, this flute is not very well made. Have you seen it? It's only got six holes. And in it goes... Good riddance! Sire... Come and see. Someone's making fun of me in this castle. Johan! The fire! Quick, quick, get out! Get outside! Fire! The king's room is on fire! A fire in the king's room? Hold on, Sire. I'm coming! But this is a jug of wine! A nice drop of wine! Feeling better, Your Majesty? It is done, Sire. The fire is out. Ah, very good. Very good. Yippee! Johan, just look what I found in the ashes... a flute! Not the flute?! Yes, it's a flute. But it isn't a flute like any other. It's only got six holes. How I'd like to know who the idiot was... The vandal who threw it into the fire. Such a fine instrument. Oh, sorry. It must be sooty. Pirlouit... Pirlouit... Hand me that flute immediately! It's no good. Are you sure it's the same flute I threw in the fire? Without any doubt. How come this flute didn't burn? I don't know. But... but why was the smoke green? I don't know. I don't know either. It's witchcraft. I'm beginning to believe it. There... It's quite clean. I'll try it out. Fantastic! But I really must let everyone in the castle hear it. You slowly pour the fresh cream, and then after that... Hey, hey, there's the seneschal. Hello there, Mr Seneschal! Look, I have found a flute. Have you really? Listen to this... I'm going to play you a little tune. Alright, but just a very short tune, then. I'm... I'm in a very great hurry. Alright. Stop it! Look here...! How dare you jump around when I am playing! Oh, I can't understand it. I couldn't help it... It's witchcraft! Witchcraft? Oh, yes, witchcraft. Is that a bad joke? All right, Mr Seneschal... And yet... Wouldn't it be marvelous if...? Oh, there's that old stuck-up, Dame Gripe. Let's see... Hello, Dame Gripe. Hello. I hear that you like dancing. Dancing? I wouldn't do it for anything in the world. Goodness me, it's true. This flute really is magical. Do you realize what that means, a magic flute? Oh, you rascal! Left, right, left, right, left, right, left... Play a little louder. I'm afraid I'm rather hard of hearing. So I danced and danced, without being able to stop. You, Dame Gripe? You actually danced? Yes, Sire. I danced. Johan! Hey Johan! See? Save yourself! She's quite nimble for her age. Sire, Johan, the flute, it's magical. People begin to dance whenever I... Listen, Pirlouit, your joking's gone on long enough. You don't believe me, eh? All right, here goes! Oh, no, Sire! What's happening? Pirlouit, stop! Stop! Do you believe me now? Admit that it really is fantastic, eh? Do you realise what I can do with it?! Left, right, left, right, left, right, halt. Guards, seize that man. Who, me? But why? Well, what's he done? Sire, this person has disturbed public order. He has thrown discredit upon the entire army... ...by using a fiendish flute. He must be thrown into prison. Oh, yes? Well, come and get me. Sire, Johan, block your ears. Oh, what's the flute done? What's happened to them? Are they dead? No, don't be alarmed, Sire. They simply fainted. They seem worn out. Worn out? But I only played a few notes. Yes, but with a magic flute. If I understand it correctly, if you listen to this flute... ...for too long... ...you fall asleep. Hey, that's right... Isn't that fantastic? No. This instrument is a terrible threat. It must be destroyed. Pirlouit! Hand me that flute immediately! I have many other things. I've got musical instruments. I've got a selection here, without equal. And what prices... what prices! Prices defying all competition. Here, look at this horn. Just listen to its sweetness of tone. But haven't you got anything smaller? Yes, of course. The flute. Here, here you are. I've got the very thing here, a flute... ...which is... I've lost it! Oh, it was a unique flute... ...with just a small defect. It only had six holes. But I do have... Hey there, landlord! Alright, I'm coming. You said you had a flute... A flute with six holes? But I lost it. Early this morning. In the king's castle. At the king's castle! Yes, I'm sure of it. But... but I also got a horn and a very pretty drum, and also... Landlord, have my horse saddled. Ah, it's the "Ballad of the Gentle Lady." Master Pirlouit? That's me. My name is Torchesac... Mathieu Torchesac. I liked your singing very much. I'm told you play many instruments... ...very delightfully. Oh, yes. I've got a whole collection of them. - Would you like to see them? - Oh, very much. Who is that man who is leaving with Pirlouit? A traveler. He asked us for a bed for the night. Well, I don't like the look of him. And I've also got some castanets... ...and a viola de gamba. The one I like, is the flute. The flute! Ah, I have one. But it's not like other flutes. It's only got six holes. Really? And when I play it, everyone begins to dance. Oh, no! Yes, yes. Come and see... It's in my room. And what did Papa Smurf say? He said we could smurf in Pirlouit's room. It's here. There it is. Oh, smurf! Missed it. Quick, let's smurf out of here! Let's smurf away. Here we are. Come in, you'll see. Hey, there it is! And you say this flute will set anyone dancing... ...who listens to it? - Come off it! - It's true. Just you listen. Stop it! Stop it! Well, do you believe me now? It's really amazing. Would you allow me to play it, just for a bit? Well, it's just... alright then. But you must promise to stop the moment I ask you to. It's a promise. Oh, no. When will Pirlouit stop all that racket? Master Pirlouit, would you please not... What's happened? Wait. I'll untie your bonds. There. Oh, my gosh. Ruffian, thief, rascal, swindler, knave... ...bandit, blackguard! Where are you hiding, scoundrel? Come here, you miserable brigand... I'll have your guts! You've made me dance. I'll make you dance too... ...at the end of a rope. You rascal, I'll cut you in pieces! Sire... someone's stolen my flute. Oh, have they? Pirlouit, what's happening? That... that man, Torchesac... he's stolen my flute. Oh, that's not so serious. But yes, this is a magic flute. And those who hear it are overwhelmed. That Torchesac is a thief. And he's sure to use the flute to rob people. Oh, dear me! But this is very, very serious. We must... we must find this Torchesac. What are you waiting for? We're there, Johan. We have found him! 1,502, 1,503. Oh, the thieves! 1,500... There he is. Bandit, swindler, robber. Just you wait. Johan and Pirlouit! You're gonna pay for this! My flute... give me back my flute! Torchesac, you're a thief and a swindler. Just wait till I get my hands on you! Giddy up! Johan! Johan, quickly, wake up. Where's Torchesac? He's hopped it. We must catch him. It's not worth it, Pirlouit... so long as he has the flute. We must find a way to break the magic spell. Oh, yes, but how? Let's see... Homnibus. The wizard, Homnibus. Of course! Let's go. Let's see, what says the book of magic spells. Grow, little plant, grow. Go on, go on. Pull yourself together! There! More! More! Go to it! I've done it! Mr Homnibus. Mr Homnibus, Johan and Pirlouit have just arrived. What a nice surprise! Prepare us a good meal, Oliver my boy. Unfortunately not, my dear friends, I cannot help you. No one knows the secret of the flute with 6 holes... Well, apart from the Smurfs, of course. The what? The Smurfs. This Smurfs? The Smurfs? What on earth is that? They're the ones who made the flute with 6 holes. Oh, then we could go and ask them to help us. That's impossible. Why's that? No one knows the road which leads to the land of the Smurfs. There might be a way to get there but... But... But what? Well, we'll try doing it by hypnokinesis. By hypno what? Hypnokinesis. It's a science which enables you to duplicate your personality... ...and transfer it to another place. Sit down. Let's see here now. "Treatise on..." No, no, no, it's not that. "Theorems of Alchemy." No, no, no, it's not that. "Witchcraft in 3 Easy Lessons." No. Pirlouit, don't touch anything! Ah, there, I found it. "Hypnokinesis." What are you going to do to us? Hardly anything. You are simply going to be made to sleep. What, again? And you will wake up in the land of the Smurfs. Look at me, at me, into my eyes. Sleep. Sleep. Sleep. Sleep. Sleep. Johan. Hey, Johan! Where are we? Well, if Homnibus didn't make a mistake... ...it must be the land of the Smurfs. Where are they all, these smurfs? Hello? Where are you? Just you watch where you smurf, you smurfs. Pirlouit... over there! Well, look, if it isn't Johan and Pirlouit! What nice smurf brings you here? Papa Smurf will be delighted to smurf you. Do what? Smurf along. Smurf me. I'll smurf you up to the village. What's he going on about? I think he said we should follow him. And all the smurfs take on the smurf... ...and smurf the smurf that I smurfed you. Hey, smurfs, Johan and Pirlouit are here! Johan. Johan and Pirlouit, they're here. They're here. We must smurf that to Papa Smurf. What's all this fuss about? Hey, hey, ho, ho, ho. Calm down, calm down! Let's go to greet them. There's Papa Smurf... he's "Big Smurf" Well, if he's "Big Smurf"... then I must be "Huge Pirlouit". You are both most welcome here. Hello, Big Smurf. We have come to ask you... Where to find the 6-Smurf flute.... Ho, ho, be quiet. Go smurfing somewhere else. They really are too much. Just because they're 100 years old... ...they think they're grown up. 100? So, what age does that make you? I've had my 542nd birthday. Well, you don't look it. Come, I'll show you around the village. We came to ask you... It's funny... You're all the same. How do you recognize each other? Yes, we all look alike... and yet... They all look the same. They look the same. They look the same. So how can it possibly be that each has a personality? This one for example has a charming weakness. He's actually known as the gourmand smurf. I'm the best smurf in my particular line... Stuffing myself is my personality. Just look at those smurfs... they're a very odd pair... smurf peasant and poet... But these two don't care. I cultivate rhyme... Full of clever ideas. Being a damned good smurf is our personality. If a smurf is too proud to do any work... ...that's the lazy smurf! Whenever I get the chance... ...to smurf out of doing any work... That's my personality. While the handyman smurf can fix anything at all... ...he is always helped by the clumsy smurf. Look at this machine which I devised all on my own. You just smurf on a lever... That's my personality! When all of the smurfs look the same... all look the same... all look the same. But they don't only have qualities... ...they each have their own personality. Singing and dancing and singing some more... ...means our festive smurfs will never disagree. I'm very fond of music, and fun and jollity... To smurf and dress up is my personality. He's really quite cute... although he's acts tough... We do love the smurf that we like to call Gruff. Well? I don't like personalities. He has a conscience and a sense of duty... ...but our 4-eyed smurf often talks too much. I should always smurf the proverb... ...that a smurf in the hand is worth two in the bush. And a rolling smurf gathers no smurf. And besides, it's by smurfing with you... When he closes his fist it looks like a hammer... ...it's because of his strength, the muscle-man smurf. I'm a nice sort of smurf... But bug me, and I'll punch you in the smurf. That's my personality. All of the smurfs look the same... all look the same... all look the same... You need to get to know them well. They haven't all been shown to you... ...and we can't quote them all. But we all have our personali... personali... personali... ...personality. I imagine you'd like a small glass of raspberry liqueur, eh? Oh, yes, sure! Do come in. Make yourself comfortable. Make yourself at home. Oh, I'm sorry! Just a moment. Cheers! Cheers. Well? Well... We've come to ask you... There they are... coming back. Papa Smurf, Torchesac continues to pillage and smurf. We've tried several times to smurf the flute from him. But... but we just can't resmurf it. Keep on smurfing, and don't smurf him out of your sight. Right. Now you were saying... That what we've come to ask you is... If it's possible to stop the affect of the flute with 6 holes. Alas, no. What we could do is to make you another flute, so... ...you could fight with Torchesac on equal terms. Oh, yes! That's a great idea. Oh, yes. Hear me, smurfs! We're going to smurf another flute. Yes, and afterwards we'll smurf a party. That one. To work! Stop! Smurf up there! Give it to me... It'll go a lot faster. It's a smurf smurf smurf. It's a smurf smurf smurf. When we smurf, do we smurf, daily smurf smurf smurf. Smurf smurf smurf. La la la la smurf. Smurf smurf smurf, he's a smurf smurf smurf. When we smurf, do we smurf when there's nothing... to smurf smurf smurf. Hey, what? Now what's happened? Look. The tree's been felled. They worked all night. Hmm. And now what? Now a party. Now you look, it's the heart of the tree... ...which is used to smurf the flute. Oh, the heart. Come now, to work. Would you like me to give you a hand now? Very well, then! Hi, Pirlouit, how's smurfing? It's smurfs. It's smurfs! Johan! I've got it. I understand. The language of the smurfs, is easy... You just swap words with "smurf" or "smurfing". Sure? But of course. You listen... I'm going to ask for a glass of water. Little smurf, I'd like to smurf. Ah, smurfing smurfie would like to smurf. To smurf? To smurf? To smurf. I don't like to smurf. To smurf you need a smurf. That's it, to smurf I must have the smurf. A smurf? A smurf? A smurf. I don't like to smurf. This it it, your smurf. What do you mean my smurf? This is it, the smurf you asked us for. That's not my smurf. Ah, but yes, a smurf, a smurf if you smurf when you want to smurf. No, listen to me. I wish to smurf a smurf. A smurf, that's all I want. A smurf? One smurf. Two smurfs. I don't like smurfing. We went to some smurf the smurf and smurfs that you asked us to smurf. Me, I never asked for a thing in me bob. The smurf who smurfs doesn't look at all like that. You can do that smurfing here. A smurfy smurf. No. But yes. Just listen to them, I got the smurfy smurf. Not the smurfy smurfs. It is just to smurf I want, a smurfa smurf that I can smurf. A smurf? Two smurfs? Three smurfs? Me, I don't want three smurfs. Is it a smurf you really want? A smurf. I want a smurf. But no, I want to smurf. I don't like people who can't up their minds. - At least let's agree, - if you want to smurf... So why didn't you ask for a smurf? That's just what I did. But you made us smurf, smurf with a smurf When you smurf, you must be quite smurf. "To smurf", is not quite smurf. "I smurf." "You smurf." "He smurfs." I don't like smurfing. Grammatically, the irregular verb... ...takes an S in the second person singular... When you speak smurf you must ensure to agree with with the past participle... What we smurfasise, is smurf clearly, and smurfs will always smurf. 20 times, re-smurf your smurf! I don't like to smurf my smurf. What's his smurf? I really can't tell you. But he smurfed us all. Do you feel ill? - There you are. - A smurf. Two smurfs. No more smurf! Here we are, the flute is ready. And now... And now can we finally smurf it and have our little party? Listen, we can't really deny them this little pleasure. They've worked so hard, haven't they? For sure. Yes, but let's get a move on. Wake up! Wake up! Wake up! But... but what are we doing here? It can't be! Why on earth have you brought us back, for goodness sake? It's too early. It's that I was worried. It's now been three days. All was going so well. The smurfs were just about ready to give us another flute. Quick, put us to sleep again. Very well... Sit down again. Now look straight into my eyes... into my eyes. It's no use... I can't manage to do it. I'm extremely tired. Oh no, you can't be. You absolutely must return us to the smurfs. At least try to send ME back. No, ME ! Come on. All right now, look at me, straight into my eyes... Into my eyes, into my eyes. That's clever. You put him to sleep. Oliver. Meanwhile, the devil only knows where we can find Torchesac. 5,432, 5,433. There's the castle of that brigand Mortaille. Ah, 5,435, 5,436, 5,437. I'm telling you to taxes raised again! Seigneur Mortaille, it's not possible. You'll bring ruin to your castle. The king might intervene and... I don't care. I need lots more money. Money? Here's some. Torchesac! You leave us. You rogue. Haven't I told you never to show your face here again? Worried, are you, that I'll tell your people... ...about all the pillaging we've done together? Shut up! Come this way. Well... I've come to put a proposition to you. I want to raise an army to invade the country... ...and become master of the whole kingdom. But to wage war, you need a lot of cash. Money? I've got it... lots of it. You there, bring in my chests. Well, you want to command my army? That's right... But we'll have to find some men. I just don't have enough. I know an island... Where you can get mercenaries who'll do anything for a few gold coins. Really? Whereabouts? Look here... The port of Trominack is here. And my island is there. Yes... I see. Besides, I intend leaving for Trominack immediately. A ship awaits me there. I'll be back here in about 10 days, Could you see? No, I couldn't. Come on! Well? All's well. He's asleep. Help! Johan! Pirlouit! Oh, come quickly. Come here. Outside there are... things! Thingumajigs! Goodness me... It's the smurfs. Ah, there you are. As you disappeared, we've brought you the flute. Now you'll be able to smurf that nasty smurf, Torchesac. Hurrah! Does it work? Oh, yes. It does work, exceptionally well. Papa Smurf, he's smurf and smurfing with smurf. What's happened? Torchesac is going to smurf in Trominack... ...to go and smurfs some smurfs. What's he saying? Come on, it's simple. He's explaining that Torchesac is off to Trominack... ...to keep himself warm by picking winkles. No? No. Torchesac is sailing from Trominack... ...to go and recruit some mercenaries. Trominack? Maybe we can still catch him. Come on, Pirlouit. Come on, smurfs! No, no... We're not all going there. I'm only taking a few volunteers. You, you, and you. What about us? What are we going to smurf, while you're away? We'll smurf a little party! We'll smurf a little party! The last chest is aboard, Seigneur Torchesac. We're ready to sail. There's his wagon... But where is he? Hey! Have you seen the man who was driving this wagon? A little fat man, with an ugly face. A little fat man? Yes. With an ugly face? Yes! And he was driving that wagon there, yes? Yes! Do you know where he is, for goodness sake? Aye, that I do be knowin'. He did go aboard that there boat over there. Oh. No. Aye, but they ain't told no one where they was agoin'. There they are. What's happened? All is lost... Torchesac is gone, and no one knows where he's going. Yes, someone knows... His accomplice... ...the wicked Seigneur Mortaille. Yes, we were there. And he smurfed him where he was going on the map. But we couldn't smurf out where it was. Because he had his back smurfed to us... ...and we couldn't smurf out what he was smurfing. Want did they say? Oh, come on... It's very clear. They're saying... OK, you can explain later. Where is Seigneur Mumford's castle? It smurfs a few leagues from here. I've got a plan. I need ink, a pen, and parchment. You, Pirlouit, go and find the fisherman. Tell him to stand by to sail. Yes, what is it? A message, Seigneur... A message? Gimme! "Come and join me as quickly as you can, you know where. A fisherman will be waiting at Trominack. Show him the way to go. I'll explain later." And it's signed Matthew Torchesac. Have my horse saddled. Hurry! There he is! He's coming! I am Seigneur Mortaille. Your boat is ready? Oh, yes, Seigneur! Come aboard. Head westward. I'll show you where we have to go. I'm sick. I'm going to die. Yes, yes. What do you mean, yes yes? All right, no no. That's better. I'm sick. So... all OK? Begorrah, aye! It's your Mortaille there, who don't look too 'appy. If only 'e knowed who sent 'im 'is message. I'm sick. Come now, be brave. You'll be smurfing better. Of course... it'll soon go away. And yet I smurfed him against his eating herring with strawberries... ...and smurfed cream and small onions and little bits of... Look out! I'm sick. No! No... Don't sit there... It's dangerous! Get up quickly. Go on, quick! Oh, I'm sick. Wait for me here! I'll be back by nightfall. Quick, Pirlouit... we mustn't lose sight of him. Good luck! Good smurfing! And a special bonus of 20,000 crowns... ...when the men reach Mortaille's castle. Right. Torchesac... Mortaille! What are you doing here? Where's he gone to? But I never wrote this letter. Then who did? The man with the boat... He'll know something about it. Come on! They're well smurfed up! That's for sure! That's for sure! We can return all this gold stolen by Torchesac. Yes, and as for us, we have two flutes with 6 holes... One for you and one for me. - We'll have such fun, eh? - No, Pirlouit... These flutes are far too dangerous. As soon as we return to the castle, we must return them to the smurfs. Agreed? I guess so. He's understood. Basically, he's a jolly good little chap. But it's Johan! We're going to smurf a little party! Hey... What? What? Louder! I'm a bit hard of hearing, you know. Papa Smurf, did we smurf them both? Yes, yes, thank you. It's smurf. Where is Pirlouit? Pirlouit? Yes, you're right... Where has he got to? Not so fast, kid. I haven't quite finished. It's the spitting image of the other one. Just in time. Pirlouit! It's Pirlouit! Pirlouit! Here it is, Papa Smurf. We can hand you back the two flutes. Here's one. And here's the other. You're doing the right thing. These flutes could have only brought you trouble. Ah, that's quite right. That's exactly what I said to Johan here. Now the time has come for us to return to the land of the smurfs. Maybe we'll smurf again one day. Who knows? Goodbye. Goodbye! Oh no! Can't be true! I made a mistake. I gave them back the magic flute! Subtitles by FatPlank
