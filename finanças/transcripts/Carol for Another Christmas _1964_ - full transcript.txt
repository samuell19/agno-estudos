Good evening, uncle Dan. Fred. I wonder if we could talk for a moment. Well, I was planning to get to bed early tonight. This won't take long. Coffee? I'll have Charles bring another cup. No, thanks. Well, now, nephew, which one of your many causes brings you out into the snowy night, huh? Some ubangis with the yaws? Some perverted mass murderer who's seen the light and wishes to assume his rightful place in society? As an alternative to the electric chair. No, no, that was... That was last year, wasn't it? Was is it this time? A movement to donate the Mississippi River to the Sahara Desert? You can do better than that. Not on a full stomach, I can't. Not before coffee. I'm here about one of your causes. What about Jack Harris? Harris? Jack Harris? I, uh... I don't know the fella. Professor John Harris? You know him. Look, Fred, we usually wind up our little discussions yelling at each other. Now, let's get a quiet start this time, all right? Jack just called me. The university board of trustees canceled his credentials for the cultural exchange program. Ah, yes, yes, that Harris. Yes, I I heard that decision. It was your decision. You just said it was the trustees'. I'm not even on the board. The words were theirs, but the voice belonged to a high powered ventriloquist named Daniel Grudge. You sit here at that desk, throw your voice through a telephone, everybody jumps... Bankers, politicians, newspapers, universities. This coffee is cold. Now, why should a little thing like this sit so heavily in your tender tummy, Fred? "Little thing"? Uncle Dan, you know what this project has meant to all of us on the faculty, to the whole university. Everything from the raising of our own pedagogical standards to international recognition to... We've worked on it for an entire year. It's been cleared by Washington, cleared by the other end, and now you come along to dump it all. Why? Why should you object if one of our professors spends a year studying and teaching abroad? Yes, abroad. Poland, wasn't it? Your professor Harris was to spend a year in Poland at the university of Krakow, was it not? Stop asking me questions you know the answers to. Would you care for a drink? No, thanks. And in exchange for our professor Harris, the university of Krakow in Poland would send to our university one of their boys, whose name, even if I knew what it was, is probably unpronounceable. Korzeniowski. It's really quite easily pronounced. That's what's known these days as a "cultural exchange." You know, Fred, for a fairly talented professor of history, you seem to be a little naive as to the current political climate of the native country of this professor whatever his name is. Are you serious? Stop asking me questions you know the answers to, nephew. Do you know what he teaches? Do you know what Korzeniowski and Harris both teach? 18th century European literature. What's that got to do with politics? I don't know. And I'm not interested in finding out. Get smart, boy. We've been digging his kind out of the woodwork for years. You don't really expect me to be a party to inviting one of them in here, now, do you? Oh, no. No, he stays on his side of the fence, and Harris stays on ours. Get used to the idea. When you finally go, that'll be your epitaph, won't it? "Here lies Daniel Grudge, on his side of the fence." Well, get used to this idea, uncle. There are certain fences the world can no longer afford. Quite a wall through Berlin, I've heard tell. Exactly. A fence. And who put it there? You think it's right? All right, Fred. Turn it off. Right now. There's only one side I'm on... First, last, and always... Our side. Don't you ever forget that. And spread it around. I want all the members of your various domestic and international orders of the bleeding heart to know precisely where Daniel Grudge stands. Because any time you and/or one of your fuzzy fellow do gooders tries to get me, or friends of mine, or my city, state, or my country, involved in any of your so called causes, then I intend to be there every time with a body block that'll throw all of you flat on your involved butts. Now, get out. Merry Christmas, by the way. Yeah, so it is. And tonight, especially tonight, I'm in no mood for the brotherhood of man. Do you mind? I've heard that speech. And heard it. Oh, I've had it with you, Fred. With all of you, I've had it, right up to here. Mind your own business. And let everybody else mind theirs. Your responsibility happens to be your classroom, not classrooms in Krakow, Poland; Butte, Montana; or Johannesburg, South Africa. Do you insist upon making it a better world? Won't you die happy until you do? Do you insist upon helping the needy and oppressed? Is that some kind of an itch that you can't stop scratching? Then tell them to help themselves. Let them know the cash drawer is closed and make them believe it. You'll be surprised how much less needy and oppressed the needy and oppressed turn out to be. But you've heard that one before. And heard it. No, I can't change you, and you can't change me. So just stay out of my way, Fred, out of my house, and out of my life. Uncle Dan. Uncle Dan, this is Christmas Eve, a very special night, apart from everything else, for you and for me. All my life, we've disagreed about most things, you and I, but there's one thing we both have in common, someone we cared the world about... Your son... My cousin, Marley. May I have that drink now? The one solitary thing on this earth that I cared anything at all for. And to what end? So that his life could be snuffed out? His fine young body turned into a bundle of bleeding garbage, in return for which, I'm sent his dog tags, some medals, and a 12 word telegram? Something for something. I give them a son, and they give me back his effects. That, I submit to you, is a lousy bargain. Nobody could argue that. The point is that kind of bargaining has got to stop. Oh. And who's gonna stop it? Armies of professional plea coppers, like you? Your kind mouth the platitudes that get us into war. His kind go off to fight them. You might raise that point with one of your debating societies. The point that, every two decades, we seem to pay for your indiscriminate affections with the lives of our sons. Those indiscriminate affections, as you put it, is simply the acknowledgement that all men have sons, that grief for the unnecessary dead is not exclusive to this country, this town, or to the house of Grudge. Mine is exclusive. It concerns me. Forgive me, uncle Dan, but I feel you mourn the death of Marley less than you mourn your personal loss of him. You keep his room like a shrine. You set a place for him at dinner each Christmas Eve because he died on Christmas Eve. Those things are for you, not for him. Who cares who they're for? I'm the one who feels the pain. And you'll go on feeling it, nursing it even, until you realize the true tragedy, the tragic insanity of Marley's death. Not that your son was killed by another man's son, but that mankind still allows such dying to happen. It wasn't his war. No war is anybody's war! I'm not talking about anybody. How do we stay out? By getting ourselves involved with the same people, the same problems, the same places? None of them our business? Is that your answer? Involvement? A hophead's pipe dream in which everybody... Yellow, black, and white... Gets thrown into one pot, and out comes a stew called world brotherhood, which mankind lives forever in... in peace and putrefaction. Is that your answer? No, not even close. But it's the way you keep putting it. Maybe for some very private reason, you have to keep telling it to yourself that way. At any rate, as you said, I sure couldn't change you. Thanks for the drink. And I have a Christmas present for you, Fred. Call it a contribution, if you like, to all your causes, involvements, exchanges, cultural and otherwise, whatever terms you apply to international freeloading on our pocketbook. If you have this overpowering concern for everybody everywhere in the world, here's your answer. Just you put your effort, sweat, and faith into developing the fastest bombers and the most powerful missiles on earth. They'll provide a lot more security for our young and for the rest of the world's young, than all your debating societies, forums, treaties, pacts, and other forms of surrender and handout. That's quite an answer, uncle Dan, for today. But what about tomorrow? Of course, you'll grant all other nations an equal right to put their faith and sweat and effort in trying to make their bombs faster and more powerful than ours. Just let them try it. Each behind its own fence. Each capable, eventually, of destroying everything and everybody else. And each uninvolved with the other. Uninvolved with us? I'll settle for that. Just let them know we have the biggest and the fastest. Just let them know we're not too chicken to use them. Peace on earth, goodwill to men. To all men, by the way. Marley?

Hey, what do ya say, chief? You're Grudge, huh? Daniel Grudge, right? Where, uh... What is this, some kind of a troop transport? Yeah, you might call it that. On its way. From France? One of our stops. Well, where else? You name it. Meet the troops. They're dead. Killed in action. Chateau Thierry, belleau wood, the marne. How you gonna keep them down on the farm after they've seen Paris? They saw Paris... Very briefly. Lafayette... They were there. You talk like the a.E.F. What's your name? I'm all the a.E.F.S. Also b.E.F.S, the poilus, the huns, the russkies, et cetera. Gallipoli, the crimea, even Waterloo, if you care to go back that far. You get the picture, chief? I'm all of them. I'm the one who rallied around the flag, any flag, all flags. See what I mean? Yeah. Yeah, no names and all names, huh? You know, I haven't heard that one since the radio programs in the '30s. Your name is Joe, Tony, Izzy, pat... All one and the same. America the melting pot, right? Wrong. I'm not getting across to you. I can see that. Who said only america, sport? I'm the dead, all the dead. We're quite a stew, you'll have to admit. Still, nameless as I am, I've got a terrific title... The ghost of Christmas past. How's that hit ya? It doesn't. No, I don't look like a ghost, huh? Do you want to make your point? It's damp out here, and I'm uncomfortable. Uncomfortable? You, chief? Why, I've been given to understand you were an old salt. That was 20 years ago when I was in the Navy. I'm afraid you still don't comprenez vous. Not 20 years ago. 20 years from now. This is 1918. Capiche? It was a long war for some of these boys. And short for some. And a short life for ours. Which ones were yours? Can you pick them out? We didn't belong in that one, either. "Made the world safe for democracy," did they? That's what they were told. They sure as hell gave it a try. Look, they change the hats, they update the slogans, but it's the same old shell game. Like clockwork. Every 20 years, somebody rings a fire bell 10,000 miles away, and out comes uncle Sam's expeditionary sucker brigade. Is that what they are? Suckers? Is that what your son's gonna be? My so... My son? My son will be a victim, just as these men are our victims of somebody else's war. You kill me, chief. You really do. If it isn't valley forge or the Boston tea party, you leave it strictly alone. Your big gripe is what? 'Cause every 20 years, American boys got to climb on troop ships and head out for someplace else? It rubs you raw. So what else is new? 60,000 limeys die in flanders. 100,000 frogs catch it at verdun. The Germans march through Belgium, and Austria declares war on Japan, but who cares? It's a nice summer. Boston's gonna win the world series. So we'll rock on the front porch and swat flies. Do I translate you right, chief? Better than American blood. Infinitely better than American blood. Amen, I grant you. If it were possible. But it ain't possible. War is also a contagious disease, Mr. G. And until we can stamp it out entir... Nobody... nobody ever found a way to do that. Right. But is that any reason to stop trying? One thing we do know... The only chance to keep this particular disease from spreading is to keep talking. So long as you talk, you don't fight. Simple? Look, I bump a guy on a street. He bumps me. We stand there. We argue. He gives me lip. I give him lip. But when we stop talking, we start swinging, and then we bleed. Then we got problems, like... winding up dead. I recognize the commercial, but it's no sale. Oh, I'm not selling ya, pal. I'm donating to you, free of charge. Remember the... Excuse the expression... League of nations, sport? That was gonna be the point there, remember? I would have been opposed to the league of nations. Of course you would. And you were, so you blew it. A bunch of fancy characters with top hats and monocles. "We're not buying any of that, right, Mr. G? No sale." We've had it with foreigners. We've had it with... With "making the world safe for democracy" and the rest of the slogans. So we tell them to drift. We're sitting this one out. That's how you keep wars from happening, right, Grudge? Don't get involved, right? Well, is it? Tell them. They'd like to know. Wasn't that how you kept the world from a second world war? Uninvolvement, stay isolated? Wasn't that how? Well, tell them! Well, obviously, if we hadn't become involved, why, they wouldn't be here. No, they... they wouldn't be here. They'd be back in their hometowns. What was left of them. Buried, right where they fell. Another ship? Also on her way. I can just make out the deck. Those are American soldiers from my war. Nicely put, chief. They're the sons. These are the fathers. Yeah, after 1918, we got sick of war, fed up. All those American kids getting blown to pieces, out of sight in foreign places with strange sounding names. So for the next 20 years, we closed our eyes and decided what we couldn't see wouldn't happen, right? 'Course, we don't want to take all the credit, do we? I mean, we weren't the only ones playing shut eye. When old Adolf walked into the rhineland, France didn't want to get involved. Italy pulled down a window shade when Hitler took Austria. England wasn't about to involve herself when czechoslovakia went under. And Russia kept the phone off the hook while Poland was destroyed. And before you knew it, everybody was singing, "don't rock the boat" while it sank slowly to the bottom. So, they died at other places on other dates. Don't you tell me you're not selling anything. Now, you listen to me. Nobody... nobody, mortal man or dressed up ghost, can convince me that every time there's a war, we have to step in and finish it. Now, you listen to this. The next one... the next one, we don't bring up the bucket. We stay home. We stay on our... Our side of the fence. Talk about your old time radio shows. Seems to me, I heard that one before, too. Hey, you want to know something, pal? That ocean you call a fence keeps nothing out anymore... Except fish. It's a lousy stream of water now. It's about as wide as a ditch. A couple of supersonic bombers can spit over it. An icbm will leave it behind. You don't want to get involved. Sport, you got a job ahead of you. You really got a job. You got to disinvent the airplane and the missile and the submarine and a litte old thing called the bomb. It. See what I mean? You don't want to get involved, you got to give back the 20th century, if you can find a chump to take it. But isolation? I got news. That went out with gas light and 50 cent steaks. It's for the dinosaurs, isolation. And closing your eyes... That's for sleeping. Also at certain times, it... it leads to dying. Convoy. Hundreds of ships, thousands of ships. Loaded with boxes, chief. China, Ethiopia, Spain, Latvia, Hungary. Undeclared wars, police actions. Some minor league insurrections. All the way back, chief. All the way back as far as anyone can remember... And still farther. But it all boils down to somebody stopped talking... So they fought... So they bled... So they died. Hey, wouldn't you think, sport... With all the brains we got on this earth, the way we build things and cure things, and invent stuff on Tuesday that wasn't possible on Monday... Wouldn't you think we could come up with something that could keep a kid from getting killed at the age of 18? Ghost? Sir? Where do they go? The ships, I mean. Where do they go? Nowheres. Like I said, just on their way. Why, Mr. Grudge? You... you want to throw a wreath or something? We've reached your port, Mr. Grudge. This is where we get off. In here. What's in there? A place you should remember. A place... A foreign place you had a feeling about one time. I doubt it. Do you, chief? Well, maybe you just don't remember too good. Not only where you've been, even what you say, like, "let them know we're not too chicken to use that bomb." They already know that, Mr. Grudge. Do you remember any better, Grudge? Hiroshima, right? Hiroshima. I was here in September 1945. I was off my ship. I came here. Of course, this is only your memory of it. It wasn't quite as clean as you remember. Well, they did quite a job. They cleared away all the dead real quick. They only left the... silence. You recognize the officer, chief? [ Girl singing in Japanese why, it's me. It's me 20 years ago. It's me when I came here that afternoon. The daffy tricks memory plays. Some things we think we forgot... we only misplaced. Would you like to get out here, sir? Good morning. Do you speak English? Yes, commander, I do. Grudge is my name. My cruise is in Yokohama. This is lieutenant Gibson. She's attached to our headquarters there. Tell me, doctor, who has that lovely voice? That is sachiko. It means "child of happiness." Sachiko. Doctor, was she... She was one of the group of schoolgirls. They were clearing away fire lanes when the bomb fell. Would you care to meet them? They're very lonely here. They enjoy company. Thank you. I must tell you that when the plane flew overhead, these children looked up at the sky. Their faces were upturned to the blast. They suffered what we call flash burns. It is a term we use to describe instantaneous thermal radiation. How badly were they burned? They have no more faces, commander. I told the young ladies that you're American naval officers, and you've come to... to wish them well. Uh, doctor, I I know it's not much consolation, but at least we can hope that their children will... Children, commander? These girls? Excuse me. Lieutenant? Sir. Never seen a burn case before? Several times, sir. I was at the Bethesda naval hospital. I was there after coral sea, after midway, after samar. I saw a lot of burn cases. And when you saw them, did you run? The burn cases I saw were American sailors, commander. They had been fighting an enemy. They weren't schoolchildren. The distinction is most subtle, sir. I'll give you that. But, my god, there is a difference. What about the kids at Pearl Harbor who looked up toward the sky? Or malayan kids? Or Chinese kids? Sympathize all you want, lieutenant, but keep your perspective. The president of the United States found it necessary to drop that bomb because there would have been 500,000 American casualties and a couple of million Japanese dead had he not dropped it. Harsh as it may sound, in my book, that makes simple arithmetic. Commander, I wouldn't debate military planning with you. I'm just suggesting that we are standing in the middle of what was once a city where, on one given morning, 100,000 people were killed. People, commander. That's almost as many deaths as the confederates had in four years of civil war. Quite apart from anything else, sir, doesn't that suggest to you that, from this second on, if the world ever decided to go to war again, it could kill itself off in a couple of afternoons? Doesn't it suggest, sir, that... maybe... Maybe war is obsolete now? Just... just do me one favor, would you please, commander? Don't call it arithmetic anymore. Fujiko? Koshiko? That's kou. Koshiko and fujiko were his sisters. That's where they were that morning. Whenever there's thunder now, they always remember. Dear god. Look, son, you take it easy, huh? Everything's gonna be all right. You understand me, huh? It's just a little thunder. Come on. Give me a smile. Come on. Little more. Attaboy. Thank you. "If thine enemy be hungry, give him bread to eat. If he be thirsty, give him water to drink." Your enemy thanks you, commander. It's starting to rain, Mr. Grudge. I remember the rain. A yellow child is a black child is a white child is a child. Can we agree to that much? Where to now? Through there, Mr. Grudge. Oh, I've been there. This time, it's... it's another place, like every place is another place. Are you coming with me? No, sir. I'm then. In there is now. Grudge, isn't it? Daniel Grudge! Join me in a snack, won't you? Potluck, I'm afraid. This table, my chandelier. You have an eye for possessions. Glad to see it. Little Turkey, Mr. Grudge? Drumstick, wing? Baked ham, perhaps? Candied yams, suckling pig? I find myself overeating at Christmas. Thanksgiving, too. A tradition of overeating, as it were. You don't make sense to me. My apologies, Mr. Grudge. I thought you knew. I'm the ghost of Christmas present. Representing what, gluttony? If you like. No, I I represent the human race, Mr. Grudge. So, to a certain extent, does gluttony. Also starvation... I represent that, too. You might say that I'm as close to being a walking, eating image of the human race as it's possible for a man or a phantom to be. Part of me feels a gnawing hunger. Part of me is satiated. I'm warm, contented, healthy, but much of me shivers in the cold. Now I understand. This is where I get my lecture about the haves and the have nots. Mankind includes extremes, Mr. Grudge. Extremes, yet some people living alone in a 24 room house, and 24 others living in one room. Some eating high off the hog... And some simply not eating at all. Not at all. Displaced persons. Today, more than 20 years after... Quite a few of them still around. The barbed wire set. How can you eat like this when you know that they're right there, staring at you? Why not? Well, it takes a special breed to stuff himself in front of starving... You hit the point there, old boy. You really did. It takes a special breed, indeed. But you see, I don't happen to be a breed, Mr. Grudge. I'm a ghost. I don't have a heart. I don't have a soul. No nerve endings, no brain center. I'm just a reflection. But then, I've already told you that. Shall I now tell you how many times you've stuffed yourself while 2/3 of the world starved in a cage? Here. Throw them a bone. Don't you talk to me like that. I have feelings. Nothing on this earth could force me to eat while starving people watched me. Watching makes all the difference, what? You never saw them while tearing into your mashed potatoes. They weren't actually there when you buttered your bread. There. Better, Mr. Grudge? Appetite back? Do... sit down. You're gonna have to explain the logic of man to me, Mr. Grudge. For example, tell me how you come about your selective morality, this ease with which you strip off your conscience like an overcoat and let your satisfied belch drown out the hunger c
