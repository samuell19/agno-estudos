Gentlemen, please wait. Go, go, go. There go our wheat thins. Right. You're right. Are you part of the organization? We're COMTEG. We just... We just pick up and deliver. Yeah. Pizza. Chinese food. Relax, Mr. Vorodny . I'll be your guide tonight. Thank you. Are you connected with the CIA? The what? The CIA . What's the CIA ? Circumcised Italian-Americans. Chinese inbreds... That's no shit. We don't know nothing about the CIA Not really. Not too much. We're a private intelligence agency. Where do we go from here? You're going to a duck farm. We're going to party. Sixty-three, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73. What do you think, George? A bottle of Greens couldn't get me past 50. I concede. That's a copout. You deserve the best, baby. You belong to Mike. Okay, folks, the party's over. Let's go. Gotta go to bed. You want me to wake you up? Well, you wind up with the paper. Come on, sweet thing. Try something that'll help you. Let's go. 5:00. Let's go. 5:00. Let's go. Oh, man. Please, five more minutes. They screwed us out of 20 minutes yesterday. Better get going. I gotta shower and shave. Here's your juice. You can shower there. Let's go. Well... excuse me, honey. I got some news. Yeah? What is it? Bad. Bad news. Bad, bad news? What is it? You feel all right? It hurts a bit. You okay? What'd you do in there? What's the matter with you? Ridin' on that blue river train ridin' on that blue river train ridin' on that blue river ridin' on that blue river ridin' on that blue river train give me $100. What can you do with this stuff now? It's monopoly money. Just get rid of it. Yeah. What do you think of that little chick you just left in bed? Pretty nice. You're a fag, you know. She thinks we're a couple of fags 'cause we split the rent. Not me, buddy boy. Why not? I'm a nosy bastard. I was snooping around in her purse. I came across this very important document. You see, now that's why girls don't go for you. You're always doing stuff like that. That's really bad news. "Dear Miss Summers, "your pap test returned and is negative. "But you do show conclusive evidence of vaginal infection. "Please call for an appointment to see me as soon as possible. "Respectfully yours, Dr. L. Wolfberg." Oh, God. Dirty guy. Dirty. Oh, Dr. Wolfberg. Holy Jesus. What does vaginal infection mean? That don't have to mean nothing. Vaginal infection means she's got a disease. It's a disease. Flipper. What's a purple grackle go like? Give me the Maryland state bird, man. Why didn't you stop me, man? “What? Why didn't you stop me? From what? From going on. You know, I think you deserve a round of applause. Ramona I hear the mission bells a-call... Are you gonna... Ramona come on. Keep singing. I hear a song caress you Vaginal infection? I'm gonna be sick. The bums are late. Our bums or someone else's? That's your signal. Sing it out! I said sing it out! Genie with the light brown smash. How would you rate her from one to ten? He's a good man. Not like you, you dirty rat bastard. Why'd you leave me in there with her all night without telling me? I know you don't have any prejudice. Besides, I knew you were sleeping. I didn't wanna disturb you. I'll get even. You'll never get a chance. Coming in, Scotty. Okay, one at a time. Come in. Sorry we're late. Yeah, sure you are. Yesterday we ran 20 minutes late, and now you guys are damn near 40. Hey, we watched some horny ducks on the late late infrared show. Ever see a duck make it, Mike? I don't wanna talk about it. Wait a minute. I don't wanna talk about it. It's a good show. It's not a great show, but it's a good show. See you tomorrow. 3:00 sharp. And how are you, Mr. Vorodny? Impatient. - Today... - Today what? I was supposed to have been taken out by Wednesday. That was part of my agreement. Well, we're not the CIA We don't know nothing. We're hired to protect the goods, and you're good to somebody. Think of us that way and you'll stay alive and be a lot happier. I've been told you've never lost one of us yet. Well, you're wrong. Mr. Gunther Rachman. Rachman hanged himself. I ain't talking to you. Look, I was only kidding, grouch. I had 50 of these printed up. All I have to do is fill in the blank. What? You mean that's not for real? We've passed them all over north beach. Oh, my God. So you think that's funny? Think that's funny? I thought it was pretty funny. I don't. You're safe now. Dirty guy. I've requested a town in Oregon. Crazy world. One more foreigner in a small town somewhere with a pension. I've asked for a town where I can raise hops. Without hops we would have no beer. I will call myself Thomas Mix. Do you like the name "Mr. Mix"? You're a ward of the CIA, Brewmeister Mix. Ask them. You all look alike, you young mercenaries. No matter what country. We're all idealists. Think we do it for the money? I don't feel very well. Maybe it's our water. You have no idea what it's like to live in a closed society. I guess I don't. How you doing, man? Who's watching the store? Come on. What, are you nuts? Come on. What're you... You just retired, Mike. Enjoy it. You can't wait out here. We'll page you as soon as we know anything. Okay. I'm gonna go over and check the instruments. Better get gloves on. I wanna check the wound. Got the drop sheet on that side? Gently. Two, three. Bring him up. Okay. Gurney out of the room. We'll get some gloves on. I'd like some orthopedic instruments. Doctor 2: Irregular pulse. Yes, go ahead with... I'll check the elbow. Check his knee. The bullet is probably out. Patella is completely shattered and the knee seems completely unstable. We need a double prep and double draping. How's his pressure? It's fair. All right, that's good enough. We better start the elbow. We're gonna need some irrigation. We at least try here. Would you hold his arm? Can we have our irrigation now, please? Okay. We'll go out and scrub. An irrigation tank. And a sponge. You want me closer or further? How is he, Joe? Pretty good. We'll be waking him up shortly. Soon as we get the cast on, you can wake him up. When we finish, we'll transfer him over. We're running low on water. Bring the Gurney in. Gurney. Slip the shorts off. See if you can lift him up. Slowly and gently on three. Two, three. Watch his arm here. Okay. You all set? All right. Get ready to transfer him. - Careful. - Three. Get his IV. Over. It's time to take your vital signs. You're in I.C.U. I'm gonna take your blood pressure. Just relax. You belong to me now. It's all right by me, honey. Care for a little more ham? No. How about some tomato? Hey, hey. I wanna hear something. Didn't hurt you there, did I? Slip it. Put this on my ear. Here you are. You gotta stick it in your ear. I gotta what? You gotta stick it in... You gotta stick it in your ear. Yeah, right. There you go. I don't hear nothing. It's all over. - Wait a minute. - Call my mother. Oh, say, can you see all right, all right. Let's see if you're still alive. Oh, yeah, it's still ticking. I think you're all right. All right. Gonna take that garbage out of here? No more of this garbage. Okay. You coming back? You know it, sweetheart. We're gonna be seeing a lot of each other. Well, I'll just be hanging around. Hello, Mike. Aw. Hey, gentlemen. Well. I asked them to hang me out there on that clothesline. Thought I'd dry out faster, you know. They're giving me some good-feeling stuff, I'll tell you that. I'm learning all about that anatomy. Like, femurs, patellas, fibulas. All that good stuff. I talk to them at night. No autographs yet? I'm saving the first spot for my roomie, but he hasn't come by to sign it yet. We turned over every rock. Nothing. Whoever made him a better offer is keeping him off the market. Yep. He sure was sweet. Not one wrong move. Just can't figure out why he didn't put that third one in my head. He's your buddy cat. Yeah. Yeah, I guess you're right. Well, he owed me one. Well, let's hear it. It's in the plus column. Normal grade five disability's a thousand a month. Mr. Weyburn thinks he can get you 1,500. Oh, that's nice. I'm coming back full-duty. Sure, but in the meantime be thankful you're working for a private company and we turn a profit. If you were still with the government, you'd be getting 200, and the GI bill. I'm your number one boy, Mr. Weyburn. Numero uno. I got that in writing from you, along with a nice Christmas bonus. Remember? My father was a minister. That's what he wanted me to be. Who cares? Who cares? I checked with the staff doctors, Mike. I also called a friend who is considered to be one of the best orthopedic surgeons in the world. He's says given a year maybe you'll be able to walk up a flight of stairs. That leg of yours will never be anything but a wet noodle. You're humpty-dumped. Face it. Thank you very much for cheering me up. Oh, thanks for the flowers. Very lovely. We'll stop in from time to time. Anything particular we can send you? Yeah. Some hash and a couple broads. You guys got connections, don't you? Under the circumstances, that seems appropriate. You may feel as the stitches come out. I hate a guy that's always right. Don't know how good a knee you're gonna have, but the scar is beautiful. This is gonna hurt a little bit. Swell. You're right. Hold it, hold it. Wait. There's something grabbing me on the elbow. No. On the bottom. Just take the cast away. You all right? It's all over. I got a headache now. That's a beautiful one too. I don't feel that. How come? Well, you probably severed some nerve from the skin, but that'll grow back. I hope not. I like not feeling it. Down again. Okay. All right. Now, let's try some leg-raisings. Up. That's good. Pull it up higher. Higher? That's far enough. Lett... Try to lower it yourself. That's it. You got it. All right. Good. Good. You got it. I'll redo it. See. Look. Well, it's... Forgot about my good right. All right, that's enough for one day. Got someplace else to go? Something else to do? My time is your time. Okay, Amy, lift his leg up. You may feel a little discomfort as it goes over the knee. Yeah, scar's a little tender. All right. Little higher. There it goes. You understand, we're gonna hook a boot on to this? Yeah, right. This here, to your arm. Good. Okay, tighten up the velcro. Okay, you got five, 10. Now let's try 15. Let's see that one. Try a little higher. Higher. Higher. I thought I'd just stop up. Here. Well, don't. Go on. Get out of here. Go on. Here. - Taste it? - Yeah, thank you. Yeah, that's good. Yes, I'll take it. Thank you. I'm sorry. It's okay. Don't worry about it. I've always wanted to take a bath in champagne. It's okay. It's locked. What's wrong? Did it jam on you? It's all right. Thank you. Thank you. It's okay. It's all right. Thank you. It's all right. I'm sorry. First you put your left leg close up tight then you move your right crutch further to the right you bring your legs together nice and tight then you do if, do it through the night then you take your your crutches without despair you take them in your hand and you throw them in the air and that's what I call up your bird looks like you're ready. Well, all right. Not bad. Where's the bedroom? Upstairs. Can you make it all right? Nothing to it. What, are you nuts? Hey, come on, Mike. Take it easy. You're trying too hard. Hey, man. Thought you were in a wheelchair. Forget rolling around. Let's get to work. - I need it. - I need it too. Excuse me. How you doing, my friend? All right, cap. I'm already started. Would you like to have a little... what's your usual? Carrot juice these days. Listen, Mike. I gotta tell you. Weyburn and the others, what the Hell do they know? They think you're becoming a ridiculous spectacle driving yourself like this. And just to show you how screwed up the world is becoming, would you believe that heroism has become old-fashioned? No, really. All the traitors, the terrorists, they're gonna get the sympathy now. That's how Hansen made his move up. The hansens of the world are in. And the cleft chins and true hearts are out. Weyburn will never put you back in harness. No way, Mike. And, if you don't mind, don't drop around the shop. The higher-ups don't like it. And it makes the boys nervous, you know, clump clumping around. Doesn't fit in with the muzak. Well. If a guy can't blow up his best friend, where's the morality in the world, cap? You're wearing it. Mike, listen to me. You limp, right? You'll limp the rest of your life. You're a cripple. When you get that straight in your head, I want you to come to my office, and I'll give you a decent, dignified job. How about it? I just want to get closer to George. God. So you find him and you zap him. Will that change Weyburn's mind? Will that give you back your knee and your elbow? No, no. But wherever they are, I know they'll be a lot happier. Well, I'll see you, cap. I'll just limp on out of here. Yeah. Oh, I'm sorry. Hey, I'm sorry. I caught you in the mouth. You all right? I won't be playing the violin again. - Put that mother back where you point it. - Like this? See, man, that's not right. All I have to do is... Okay? Flex up like this. That's an instant reflex. You hit a guy there, he's not gonna lose any sleep. But use the same block you made, pivot toward me. Bring your, bring your hip toward me. Right. Right. Bring your elbow to my temple. You'll spill my brains. Let's try it. - Try it? - Yeah, let's go, man. Boy, you're getting cocky, huh? Same old dirty self. Western airlines, flight 419 from Mexico City now arriving gate 39. COMTEG tape library. Hold on a second, please. Mr. Collis . Collis here. Your friend O'Leary's in the office. Come on up. O'Leary? What does the son of a bitch want now? Everything, as usual. Right up. Feed the rest of that railroad projection through. Be back in a few minutes. Talking to them isn't enough. Their longevity lies within the context of your communication. Oh, I know. I know. I know. I even recite the love sonnets of Elizabeth Barrett Browning to the poor thing. It's probably dying of boredom. Danny, how are you? Did you ever consider, my dear cap, how much energy you've wasted over your 47 years mustering up that good fellow smile and that insincere handshake? What the hell corner has he painted us into now? The CIA Gives us 11 percent of our gross. We can live without it. Then give me 10 minutes of your time. Surely 11 percent of your gross will buy me that, now won't it? Why so unusually hostile, cap? Hansen sold out. He killed one of our most important clients. Your client, by the way. He shot up our top man. You still think we were behind that? Why not? What aren't you behind? Would you like it book, chapter and verse? Or just the morning paper? I can read. So what have you got for us now? San Francisco airport this morning. It'll be in the papers by now. They didn't quite match the massacre at Tokyo airport, but it looks like they gave it a nice try. Yuen Chung, the clear target of a rather substantive assassin group defended himself with his usual skill. Chung? I thought somebody had taken care of him. Just a question of time. But it's not in the national interest that it should happen either today or for that matter, tomorrow. It's especially central that it doesn't happen under any circumstances within the confines of the United States. What happens to him Friday after he's gone is no longer our concern. Who tried to kill him this time? We're not quite sure about that yet except it's something off the far east circuit. We've had word that Negato Toku may be in the country. Who in the hell is he? Godfather of all the ninja assassins, but he's never been outside Japan, as far as I know. Well, if he is here, you can understand, it's either for compelling personal reasons or he's been paid a lot of yen. The point is, we do know that Yuen Chung is here. We've got to keep him alive until he connects with a ship. The position of our agency is, for once, manifestly clear. We don't wish to and will not become involved any further than we already are. Then why should we? We don't want Yuen Chung killed in the United States. Right now we can't afford the publicity. You still haven't given us a reason why we should take this on. All right. The clincher. We've had word that after the chop suey at the airport this morning, the Japanese assassin group had been augmented by a backup team, an American expert. George Hansen. We just took the job. San Francisco's a beautiful place. Try to adjust. Be happy here. Hold it! You're not authorized here. Let me see your identification. Officer, will you look at this? Will you let them by, please? Let's go. Wait a minute! What's going on here? Hold it! Gary. May I see your identification, please? Thank you. I want a first-rate team on the job before dark. Where do they pick up on your boy? When you have the team assembled, call my office. You know the number. I'll give you an address. Give this to Locken, cap. Let him pick his own team. Let him sub-contract it himself. In fact, give him the complete responsibility. What about the window? Win a few, lose a few. You'll pay for it, right? We'll take care of it. I'll pay a buck to the first guy who gets my cane back. Hey, dude. Thank you. Very impressive. Well, thank you. At close range. What happens when your opponent is 20 feet away holding down on you with a 12-Gauge pump gun? Well, I guess I just shoot him with mine. Where would you get it? Same place you got yours, you jackass. We need to talk. Donnie, I'll call you guys later. Thanks a lot, huh? Take it easy. Bye-bye. Bye-bye. How you doing? Hello, cap. You're looking good. Yeah. Feeling good. Well. Well, you're back in, Mike. We need you. Why? Amy. Would you excuse us for a minute? Who's my sheep? An Asian politician. All you gotta do is keep him alive until we can get him out on a ship. - When do I start? - Now. First you'll need a driver and a backup. What for? Me and my cane. You're up against a team of international assassins. You need all the firepower you can get. On top of that, the entire San Francisco police department is looking for your man. He left some debris at the airport this morning. I'll guess I'll get Mac and Miller. One's retired and the other one's crazy. COMTEG won't stand for it. Am I calling the shots? How much time have I got? 5:00. And when does East meet West? Our contractee will let us know. You call me when you're set, two minutes to 5:00. Well, I'm gonna need some things. Get them. Is there a bullish market on Asian politicians? Oh there's, um... There's someone on the visitors team we'd like you to tag for us. George Hansen has finally surfaced. He's shopping for the oriental. Well. Why up here? I like it up here. You like it. I guess that's good enough. Still dealing in original sin? Waiting for a shipment. Brand new AK-47s. Best combat rifle in the world. Got a buyer, but the guns are running late. Well, I got something a little better than clay pigeons for you. I heard they retired you. No, not yet. I don't think your company'd hire me. They got me tapped as a psycho. Well, they just don't understand you, Miller. You're not a psycho. You're the patron poet of the manic depressives. I'll give you 500 a day. How many days? Don't know yet. Can't be too long, though. I don't think anybody can handle three days of what we got. Well, I need a little vacation. Besides, you always did enchant me, Locken Oh, did I? Well, hell, we'll just pick out some furniture and get going. Meet you at Mac's garage, 1874 Fuller. How are you, Mac? You look okay, for a robot. Yeah, well... I owe it all to 3-in-1 oil. You know, I come to the hospital, and then I still wrote you. You don't write back. Your right arm doesn't work either, huh? You know how hard it is for me to write, Mac. Look, you got a couple days you can give me? Like... From now till the day after tomorrow? What are you up to, Mike? Same old thing. I thought you were out of that for good. Well, it's a chance to get Hansen. That's very bad thinking, Mike. I already took the job, and I need you. Unless you want them to get me. How are you, Josephine? Hi. Here's your coffee. It's hot. Why do I need them? There not for you. They're for her. Here. Oh. Thanks, Mr. Davis. I need something heavy. Something fast. Something that will blend in. I'll go put these in water. Okay. Something heavy? Hmm? Yeah. Pst. Is this it? Remember him? Sam from the company. How are you, Sam? Good to see you. Loose muffler jacket. I got it bolted down. Thank you. Well, it blends in, all right. What else has it got that makes it so charming? Gas tank is tucked under the rear seat. Steel-plate wrap-around, reinforced bumpers. And it's a fully blown engine. How come we never used this before? I just got it, Mike. Some union guy put it all together. Bulletproof glass. And then they shot him in bed. I got it from his widow. I thought you kissed the business off. Why'd you buy a buggy like this? You know, maybe I appreciate a good machine. I used to think what I did was nice and necessary, you know? What the hell do I know? Miller. Partner. Who's the clown behind the tool rack? You know this fella? That's Miller. He's with us. He's our rear gunner. Josephine was robbed a couple of times last month. I'm sorry. Nice place like this. May I see it? What, are you Wyatt Earp? I got something better if you want it. No, that's fine. Old weapon. Slow rate of fire. Heavy. Hard to aim. Nice chrome. What's your first name, Miller? Jerome. - What? - Jerome. Jerome? Jerome. Come on. Let's go. Oh, hey! Do I got time to change? No. We'll clean up later. Come on. You have to sign this right here. It won't go out if you don't. Can I have a clean shirt? I'm gonna go away for a couple of days. I thought you said you were gonna give up that profession for good. I'm gonna be gone a couple of days. If anybody calls. I'm sorry, Josephine. You know how it is, don't you? Okay. What's the matter with Josephine? She's upset 'cause I'm leaving. No. She called me Mr. Davis. Whenever you're around, she calls everybody Mr. Davis. Remember? Just like the old days. Okay, this'll just take a second. You guys behave yourselves, huh? Jerome? I know a lot about you, you know that? Don't hurt anybody just for fun, okay? That's not nice. How would you like me to take that 45 and shove it where it belongs, cabby? Do you like stewardesses? Sometimes. All right. Here's where you're going. Front entrance, 39 Grand Avenue, back entrance, 46 Waverly Place. Ask for Mr. Yi okay. Moving. Head to Sacramento. Right on grand. You apparently planning to work in close? That's right. You just handle the perimeter. Why not, partner? I'll be with you on the perimeter, Jerome. I don't know what I'd do without you. Hey. Don't stick that muzzle up in the air like that, man. The whole world'll see us. My backup, Hamilton. You'll find everybody there. Does his crowd have this yet? Had to hand them the Xerox. Cap, this is going to make for too much clutter. Exactly my feeling. I told Mr. Collis that I strongly object to his bringing you into this. My group, the ninja, work much more quietly. They're clowns. That thing they tried at the airport this morning was a three-ring flop. Your people may be black belts or whatever, but if they get in my way, that's a promise. It's a matter of indifference to me who eliminates Yuen Chung . However, Mr. Collis, simply as a matter of racial pride, if my group, the ninja, handle this matter and become personally involved, and if your man fails, you and I will have to renegotiate our arrangement. There it is, George, the bottom line. I won't let us down. I don't believe for a second that you'll lose out either way. In fact, you probably sent for this group. That's your style, cap, setting people against each other. Mr. Collis. Have you visited your Swiss francs lately? Your deposits have arrived on time. Thank you. This is it. Okay. We're gonna take them out this way. Let's go, Mac. Take me around front. All right. Jerome, you watch those ledges over there. My buddy likes those down angles. That's his favorite lick. I prefer the up angles. Love to watch gravity at work. The client is obviously not a pro. Anybody can fire into those windows from across the street on the roof. Rifle, grenade, anything. We'd better take them out to the country where we can lay a control zone. You know a place we can stow him? Yeah, sure do. George and I did some aerial photography on this place, along with a lot of footwork a long time ago. Keep that thing down if you can. You know what I mean? Okay. Here. Hand me my case, will you? Now, look. You cover me to the door, Mac. And keep your eye out for any police cars, right? Right. Here. Take this, let me know what's happening. Yeah. I get it. I'll bring my man out the back as soon as I can. Cover me. Okay, here we go, Jerome. Whoa. Thank you. I was told to ask for a Mr. Yi. I'm the one you're asking for. Hey, who are you? Who are you? Tommie, that's enough. Hold it. Let's keep it clean and simple. No subtitles, please. Your guest is waiting. - I'm Yuen Chung. - How do you do? - She's my daughter. - How do you do? Is this your whole party? Why should we trust you? Don't. Die. Who's paying you? Who's asking the questions here? I am. Who's paying you? A private company. COMTEG. Well, what do you think? This place is indefensible. Any attack in force would finish us. Mike? Mike, a cop is coming. Okay, we're coming. Hold it. Hold it. You know Locken? I'm with Locken . Jerome, what are you doing? Nice friends you have. There's a garbage truck blocking the alley. Yeah, so what? So, there ain't no garbage cans on the street. Let's go. Holiday Inn, please? I'm occupied, miss. Hey, Mike? _shh. Hold it. George is up on the roof by the billboard. He's got someone else with him too. Right. Hold up. All right. Let's go. Hold it! Are you gonna be surprised when you see my gun permit. Throw the gun over there. No, I can't do that. It's got a hair trigger. And if I throw it over there, there's a lot of people up here who are gonna get hurt. Throw it. No, hold it, Jerome. Jerome, don't pull down on a cop. Do what he says, Jerome. Are you crazy? Now you just made me an accessory. Mike. There's a garbage truck blocking the alley, and no garbage in sight. I wish Miller were in it. Forget it. He's no cop. What do you mean he's no cop? Look at his gun. Tell me that's not a nine millimeter star, and I'll kiss your ass. Just from that, you knew that? San Francisco police department packs regulation Smith and Wesson .38s. That's all. Come on, Jerome. Pull her in tight when you squeeze. She likes to buck. - All right. - I'll run for the tool kit. Watch it. Yeah. Maybe it would be better to wait here until the real police come. I don't give a damn what you want. If you want to live, get in that cab. Go on, move it! Go on! Get them out of here! You just want me to leave you here? I said get out! I thought I told you to get out of here! I'm not going. Come on. Get me out of here. Get me across the street. I want to get George. - Are you here to help us or not? - Shut up! Are you listening to me? What's the matter with you, Mike? All right, get us past that truck. Come on! We've gone through this. Get ready, Jerome. Mac: How'd you like that? Stay down! Stay down! Stick your foot in it, Mac. Mac: Whatever you say. What are you, Stirling Moss? Come on. Get out of here! Hey, we're going. Watch it. Watch it. Watch it. I'd say the first round was Locken's. I misjudged him. His anticipation was better than mine. There's a credo at the company I forgot to remember. Always operate on the "six p" principle. Proper planning prevents piss-poor performance. Don't be hard on yourself. I had a clear line on him, but missed. How do we find him now? Finding him is not the problem. Getting inside his defense work, that's what the problem is. Where do you think he'll go? I don't know. Code 33. In pursuit. Yellow cab, number 265... Step on it a little, Mac. Come on, man! I thought you had something in this machine. Do it! Lovely. That's it. What are you slowing down for? I don't like it. Something's the matter. What's that, Mac? I want to check something. There's a rattle in the back. Come on. Hurry up. Ooh. What is it? It's a bomb. What? What are you talking about, "bomb"? Near the exhaust. Our old buddy, Sam. Get it out of there! I'm working on it. Oh. A cop. Here . Stash this under there. Hi. Need a tow or something? Drive shaft. I think I got it, thank you. Want me to call the auto club? I'll have it fixed before they get here. Patrol unit one, patrol unit one, your location, please? Patrol one to headquarters. What do you got in that bag? Primer cord, plastic, shape charges... No, I mean something that's not lethal. Everything is lethal. Woah! Look, things are bad enough. Y'all step out of the car where I can see you. I'm not gonna ask again. I want everybody out of the car. Yes, sir. Just hold on. Easy. Don't shake the car, Goddamn it. All right. You. Underneath, get your hands where I can see them. No. Look, I'd like to show you some I.D. Yeah, I'd like to see everybody's I.D. In a second. Now's a second. Get your ass out of there, before I drag you out by your heels. No. Hey, this bomb will go off. Please. Bomb? What bomb? This bomb. This bomb. Here. What the hell do you want me to do with it? - That's not a bomb. - Sure it is. That's an old piece of muffler. Hold it a minute. Look. That's the timer. It looks like it's set to go off two minutes from now. Everybody get back. What do you plan on doing with that thing, officer? I'm gonna throw it as far away from here as I can. Woah, ho, ho, ho. I wouldn't do that. That'd kill everybody. That's plastic with a detonator and it's got a maximum range of a hundred yards. What should I do with it? Well, see that bay right there? I'd run down there and chuck it in there. We'll wait for you here. Listen, officer, I'd sure run. What a dummy. Come on. We blew our cover. What? Can't risk driving another mile. Christ. Now what are you gonna do? Well, we're just gonna have to do things my way. I'm gonna take your catch and take it the pier over at Bethlehem steel. We're pulling out at 8:00. We'll deliver at 3:00. Will she be waiting? I'll have her standing by. And in the meantime, I'll arrange for the transfer. Yeah. Put the phone down, cap. No more calls. I'll see you in your office... Just put the phone down. I just wanted to... I said no more calls. Excuse me. I just want to go to the bathroom. Sit down. It's in your imagination. I expect you to get Chung out to sea tomorrow. I consider it nothing more than a routine matter. Keep working. Which department? Which department? Don't answer the phone. Thank you. IBM stock. Oh, it's going down. That's bad management. Well... it's not my problem. We're in the hotel business anyway. What about plastics? Condoms? Anything in there about condoms? Um... I saw that just a moment ago. Good. Wait a minute. Which department? Distribution. Make a note of it. Haven't you fixed that damn thing yet? This I don't believe. The stock's up. They don't even have a company. Don't answer the phone. No, I'm not gonna. Work. Hungry? Now that you mention it. App. is down. Well, it's getting late, and I'm tired. You can do this for me, huh, cap? I'll bring you a nice mess of catfish. I'll see you in a couple of weeks. Good-bye. Hello. Where the hell have you been? I've been busy. You know the pier at Bethlehem steel? I know where it is. I worked it four years ago with Mike. You'll be there. I'll be there. You know, my dad trusts you. It's not like him. Why not? I'm one of the beautiful people. Got lots of girls? Yeah, tons of them. I send my extras over to Turkey for harem duty. I'm a virgin. Well, that's... that's very nice. I really don't have time for your confessions right now. Look, kid. I don't want this to sound too harsh but to tell you the truth, I really don't give a shit, all right? Stand by the bow line. Too many damn windows, partner. Yeah, well, let me worry about it. You stay on the outside. I'll go on the inside. Listen. Call Ben and Donnie. Tell them to meet me here at the shack a half hour before dawn, all right? Okay. Soon as we get all secured. Right. I'm gonna need an extra man to stay here with the boat. I will. Give him a shooter, will you Miller? I won't need anything. Another Kung Fu expert? Don't underestimate him. Yeah, well look. As far as I'm concerned, I don't care if he runs for president and winds up in Arlington. Miller, you stay out here up high. Sorry to tell you, pal. Yeah. Yeah. All right. The rest of us inside. Let's go. Move it. Let's go. You stay with the boat. Take it down easy. They're loaded. Okay. All right. Come on. Come on. Let's go. Let's go. Go straight to the back. There's a staircase. Go upstairs. Put a light on if you can find one. We'll wait down here. Hey, this is a mouse trap, Mike. Go on, please. You're using them as bait. They're here. They sure are. He'll be here. I know him. I can just feel it. Is that why you made him put the lights on upstairs? He really blew you apart, didn't he? Whatever he does dictates the way you go. You're getting to be his prisoner, Mike. Up here. You're wrong, Mac. Never had it more together in my life. You know what makes me laugh? Since 5:00 this afternoon, you've been getting shot at, stabbed at, yelled at. You broke enough local ordinances to put yourself on ice for 100 years. And how many dead people so far? Just that one dude. Course, Miller got his limit. Oh, yeah. I know the rationale. Self-defense. God and country. Another assignment in national interest. This one does have a little fringe benefit. Damn it, Mike. You're so busy doing their dirty work, you can't tell who the bad guys really are. Don't worry. I know who the bad guys are. Anybody that tries to hurt me. They're all trying to hurt you, Mike. All the Goddamn power systems. All the wheelers and dealers at the top with their gin and fizzes. They need guys like you to do their bloodletting while they're busy making speeches about freedom and progress. They're all full of bullshit. Not one power system that really cares about us civilians. Okay, that's enough. Will you take a little air? Set one of those automatics at the back door. Now check the back, all right. You take the boat, and check out the catch. I'll go this way. What the hell are you doing? Where are you going? Going out to use the night. To use the night. Isn't that adorable? Hey look, I've got a maniac out there with a 30.06. He's gonna blow you apart if you take 10 steps. He'll have to see me first. Look, kid. Look, do me a favor, will you? Go over there and do the tiger claw and the crane stance and the chicken wing and all that other crap in the corner! Because out there, it's no good. Look. You're her father. Can you talk to her, please? She's been shot at before. What kind of whacked out family is this? Jerome! Don't shoot! It's that whacked out chick in a wet suit! Can you hear me? I hear you. Well, get your finger off the trigger! Okay. Okay. That's great. Now, if Hansen's within a mile of us, he knows exactly where we are. It must be true about you people. You don't care whether you live or die, right? Of course we do. It's in the manner of living and of dying one finds relevance. Oh, so that's how you're gonna do it? You're gonna go back to your country to die? Who's gonna keep you alive when you're there? I don't need an army. I'm not a revolutionary, nor do I want power. We heard that before. Wait a minute. I understand it now. You see, he wants to go back to die on his own native soil. It's that salmon-up-the-river shit. Every country, if it hopes to become a democracy, needs at least one voice raised in opposition. I happen to be selected. Let just one other person hear my voice. That is a beginning. It's enough. I'll give you this. All the other sheep I've dipped have always been running away from their countries. You're the first one I've met that's jumping back into the frying pan. That's what I was telling you before. You're risking your life keeping him alive, and getting him back someplace where they're gonna finish him off anyway. And why do you have to drag your daughter along? Huh? Shouldn't she be in a convent or something? For the same reason, Mr. Locken , you were not able to keep her from going outside. Hey! Mac, do me a favor. Run a check on the back again, will ya? Then check on the boat. I'm very glad that I'm not your insurance broker. But you are. I am? Well, you better check your Goddamn policy. And pick up a weapon. 'Cause all that philosophical bullshit's not gonna get you on that ship tomorrow. Now, pick up a Goddamn weapon! Bullshit! Mike! I got the girl. Tell her father to come out. And you and Mac and Miller go out into the light. Further out. Otherwise, she takes three straight into her inscrutable smile. Let's go, now. Mac. What, you go through her purse yet? Not yet. I haven't had time. I thought for the right price, you always had the time. You're right, man. I got the right price. Like me to cut you in? Don't be stupid, Mike. What do you mean? What do you mean, what do I mean? We both work for the same guy. Collis ? Don't feel bad. I got the highest buy-out figure any of us ever got. I set a new standard. Look at it that way. Well... Well, this one is Bora Bora for the next five years. The good life in the sun. Put it down, Mac. Go on. Why didn't you kill me? I like you, Mike. We've been there, man. If it hadn't been me, it would have been somebody else. Shoot him! He happens to have a gun at your head. You wouldn't shoot an 18-year-old girl, would you? You bet I would. You bet I would. You believe this, George? It's lovely, isn't it? So all I got to hear now is a little Chinese soap opera. Shut up! Shut up! I've notched every one of these little .38s myself, you know. Well... Be quite a scene now if we all started shooting, wouldn't it? Be something else, wouldn't it? Where's Miller? Miller? Come on down. Shit. I'm coming. Hurry up. Look, Mike, I got nothing against this girl here and I'm dead-set against killing you. It's the chinaman I want. It's his problem. It's his kid here. So give him to me. I'll see if I can hustle Collis into boosting my fee. Give you a nice piece of it. But, Mike, if you don't work this out with me, we're both screwed. Collis has a Mixed bag of killers backing me up. For all I know, he sent them over here after both of us. Well, win a few, lose a few. Now, stay right where you are. Put your pistol down. Put your cane down. I hear you've gotten pretty good with it. I'll see you again, George. See you. Where are you going, Mike? Where are you going? Mike? Phew! Close, partner. Close. He didn't mean it, Jerome. Yeah. Yeah? Let's go back in and get comfortable. Of course, the optimum would have been a confession from Collis himself. With Hansen dead, we don't have a witness but at least it's a step in the right direction. Look, I don't give a damn about that. That's your department. I just want to know what the hell I'm supposed to do now. I'm sure as hell not gonna follow Collis's rendezvous plan. He's gonna find out that Hansen blew it, and send the rest of that pack down on us before I can get Chung out to sea. Listen carefully. Tomorrow morning, get over to Suisun Bay where the mothball fleet is anchored. Line G. Queen Victory. And wait. I'll have transportation for you around 12:00 noon. All right. 12:00. Oh, and Mike? Yeah? I want you to know I'll get Collis . And when I've nailed him, his job is yours. District supervisor. How does that sound? What do you got there, an upper? Downer. Maybe I ought to have one, huh? Where the hell have you been? We've been looking for him all night. Come on. Let's go. Let's go. Come on, you guys. Give him a hand with the staysail. Hold on. I'll give you a hand. Something funny. Something funny. Who the hell's paying for this graveyard, anyway? I don't like it, partner. Don't like it at all. I don't like it either. We'll go around, tie up on the other side. Hey, Mac? Yeah? Take over, will you? Yeah, I'll take the wheel. Stand back. Why don't you go check that Uzi and the other stuff? Hey, why don't you take the kid down below and stay there. Stay there till you hear from me, all right? Mac, cut it to starboard! I got it, Mike. Ready to dock. Listen, if something don't sound right to you, take off. Right? - Okay. - Let's go, Mac. Mac? I'm coming. Yeah. Hold it. I knew it. Collis ! Yeah? I got Chung down below on a ship. Any funny move, he's got orders to take off! Let's talk. Let's go. Keep your eyes open, boys. Yeah. Park it over here, Mac. Right on time. After all we put you through since yesterday, you look spectacularly unruffled. An old war horse. Well, the ship should be here in about half an hour. Hansen told me, you know. Why not? You were buddies. Everybody pays you, don't they? I mean, our side, their side. Sides, sides. All full of shit! They all want the same thing, to be in charge. You think your oriental friend is any different? He's just another ambitious politician. Listen. So you blew my top boy right away. You can take his place. Right now. With a... Ow! Ow! Slow. Yeah. Nice, round 50 grand in it for openers. Fifty? How come their side pays so much higher than ours? This Asian politician pays top dollar. Don't be stupid! You know I'm covered. Come on! Hey, Milt, they're not supposed to go. You just retired, cap. How's it feel? Hiyaah! Behind you, Mike. Mac, here we go again. Hiyaah! Hmm. Hold it. Don't you people ever listen? I told you to sit tight down there, didn't I? I thought it was good that we came. Chung! Now! I hear. Hold it. That's it. He's going to the S.F.P.D. It's over. You got it? Some things you don't talk away. You don't push away. My country grows many like toku. I'll shoot the guy, Mike. No, please don't! If I don't survive, I'm not the man that's needed. I never heard so much bullshit in my whole life. How are you going to save your people standing toe-to-toe with this mother? Huh? We didn't go through all this stuff the last three days to stand here and watch you get killed. Come on, Mac. No, please. Many times, man's decision betray their confusion. One must develop clear roads to follow. - Give me. I'm gonna shoot him anyway. - Mike. Don't. Please. “Who cares? What are those outfits, anyway? I don't know. Ritual gowns, maybe. Goofy-looking things. Lay me seven to five. I'll take the little guy. Locken! The cutter's on its way. Use Collis's boat. Pick up the cutter in mid-channel and put our client aboard. Collis is finished, thanks to you. Take a few days off, then come in and we'll start you up in your new job. And congratulations. I thought I was supposed to see my clients home. Put them on the cutter. That's our only responsibility. Mike. When are you gonna listen to me? He used you. Weyburn used all of us to clean up some office politics. How much would we make if we went back with you? Nothing. Nothing. That much, huh? Well, that takes care of that. Walk away. Come with me. Be a civilian. You're not going to stay with this son of a bitch, Weyburn, after he set you up too. That's all he knows. Yeah, you could be half right. Weyburn ... Before this poor fellow here got hurt so bad, he owed me some money. See, and he gave me his boat which I thought was a very, very nice gesture. I guess 'cause he felt so bad. You understand? So, I'll see you. What are you doing? How many times did I tell you? How can I take you anywhere looking like that? Look how dirty you are. Why don't you clean up? Excuse me. Bye. You don't know "bye," huh? Get me to a hospital! All right, fellows. Get him on my boat. Are you gonna tell me? Tell you what? Where we're going. Don't know where we're going. Don't know where we've been. But I know where we was wasn't it. What? Let's go bananas. All right. Let's cast off. Okay. Casting off all lines. - How did it go out there? - It went. Come on. Let's get out of here. Your transportation is waiting. What about Josephine? Leave her for Mr. Davis. - What? - Yeah. On. What's the matter?
