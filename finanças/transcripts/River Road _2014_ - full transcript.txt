In the early centuries C.E. the nomadic Tangut, Khitan, Tibetan people roamed Central Asia vying for control of the region. In the late 9th century the kingdom of the Sari Uyghur was powerful in the Hexi Corridor of the Silk Road. By the 11th century the regime had been destroyed by the Western Xia dynasty leaving the Sari Uyghur people scattered throughout the Corridor Today, 14,000 descendants of the ancient Sari Uyghur still live in the Hexi Corridor. In 1953, they were officially named the Yugur ethnic minority, meaning wealth and stability. Don't bring any more water We've broken some drills already They used to drill 4 or 5 meters deep for water Now we can't get any water for 10 or 20 meters People are digging wells everywhere for new farmland There are too many wells, and there's not enough water The water level has fallen. Now it's almost run dry Sell your sheep while they're still fat Otherwise, you won't get a good price. Dad, here's your medicine. How do you feel? The same. I'm not going to die It makes no difference if I take it or not I live close to town There's no need for you to get me medicine How is your wife feeling? I had to sell half my herd to pay the doctor You should look after her anyway I will make sure that Bartel comes to see his mom this summer Is there water in the fields so the herds can graze? We can't stay there very long The grasslands closer to the town are drying up Better fields for grazing are further away We walked along the river for days before we found a meadow with water Most of the grasslands are protected by conservation It's getting hard to do an honest day's work as a herdsman Be persistent Too many young people have sold their herds and become farmers Crops are being planted on the grasslands Wells are everywhere But the wells are nearly dry and so are the lakes Some people are trying to mine gold or have gone to the city for work. They will never herd again It's a pity. When I was young cows and sheep grazed on the grassy meadows. That wasn't a long time ago We can't stay very long on the new pasture We must go further away to find water Summer vacation starts in another month If you herd further away from town I'll look after Adikeer for you I'll give him food and a little money Dad, don't come with me any further The herd hasn't been out to graze for days My wife is waiting for me to bring her medicine Dad! I found this balloon box on my way here Give to Bartel but don't let Adikeer know Okay The touch of mother's hand is always gentle Ever since I can remember my mother's gentle hands sewed new cloths for me When I left home for school my mother's gentle hands silently packed my bags All her longing and endless love accompanied me on my journey Children! In addition to identifying the main themes of each paragraph also write down the lines of this author that evoke images of tears streaming down your face and an aching heart when you think of those gentle yet tired and withered hands of your mother This shirt seems to fit Bartel Hello How much for this shirt? That one? 50 yuan No way! Fatty's mom bought the same shirt last week for only 40 yuan That's true. 30 yuan for a child's shirt is enough I'm not selling it for less than 50 yuan! Bartel! Bartel! Dad is buying you a new shirt! Bartel! Dad's bought you a new shirt! Dad, didn't you buy me one? No. Let's go What about me? Your brother will grow out of it by next spring. You can have it then Why do I always have to wear Bartel's hand-me-downs? That's not fair Don't behave like this. Stop crying. You're not little anymore Dad! Odorji! That's unfair! Tell your wife to take this medicine Make sure you give her the drops the same way you used to do If you don't see any improvement you should take her to be examined in the city hospital Wait! I need to tell you something Your father came to buy pills a few days ago He's not been well lately You'd better take him to the hospital to be checked Okay Don't waste your money Listen to your teachers You must dry the meat and cheese so they don't go bad Go back to class You can come home next month for your holiday Don't forget to pay the camel fees Take it all! I don't want anything from our father My grandpa cooks me great meals everyday Your father found this on the street He only found one so he wants you to have it But don't tell Adikeer Your parents want you to go live with them. Your mom is very ill This summer I will take you to them You must go to see her Don't blame Adikeer It was your grandma and I who felt that your mom was finding it difficult looking after you when she was pregnant We felt it was better for you to live with us We thought that when you were older you could go back to live with your parents and brother Even though they treated me like their favorite guest and gave me everything I wanted I still cried for you and Grandma at night They had no choice except to bring me back here I was four when Grandma died. They didn't want you to be lonely so they left me here with you You've told me this so many times Grandpa, did I get it right? It happened because your mom was pregnant with Adikeer before you turned one She couldn't look after you because she was having another baby My parents don't care whether I'm around or not. Isn't Adikeer enough for them No matter what, you have to go to see your mom this summer I promised your dad I would take you to see her this summer Grandpa, why are you here? I came to get medicine and also to pick you up Let's go, Grandpa Go get your younger brother. We'll go home together Adikeer Adikeer, come here! Come here! You will stay with us this weekend and come back to school on Monday with your brother Let's go Do you like school? No Why not? If I wasn't in school, I could ride horses and herd sheep In school I feel like a sheep Oh, you like to herd? I wish I could grow up faster. I want to be a herder like Dad and go wherever I want Grand[a, why doesn't Dad herd closer to town? The grasslands closer to town are getting drier and drier The pastures further away from town are more fertile Herdsmen always live near the lusher pastures Grandpa, why aren't the grasslands here as lush as the ones far away? The grass is getting old like me It's sick and needs to rest Bartel, share your toys with your brother Adikeer, eat some cheese and jerky Grandpa, where's my balloon box? It's underneath the drawers I thought you didn't like the balloon box I found You didn't find it. Odorji found it. He only found one and he gave it to me I'll take you to Sandaoliang meadow tomorrow Many balloon boxes have come down there You're lying, Grandpa. They haven't found any in Sandaoliang They've only dropped in the desert on the west side Where are you going? To pee Deep in the meadow there lived a family They are the Huda family They have many cows and sheep One Two Three Four Five Six Count them all Oh, the sheep are in the meadow Sir, please give me handful of wool The river carries The blessings of our ancestors Please bless our children and help them find their way home The meadow expands like a father's embrace The river flows like a mother's love The green grass is disappearing The rivers are drying up Students. We've just learnt the method of rounding-off to get the approximate answer Let's do an exercise Suppose today's exchange rate is one dollar to 6.21 yuan Alright. Your mom has 600 yuan How many dollars can she get? Can you calculate this? Yes Do it Please calculate to two decimal points Adikeer Why isn't your brother here? I don't know Go to your grandpa's home after school. Tell your older brother to come to my office Okay He's delinquent and has a bad attitude He's been absent from school for two days Sit down Time is up. Pass your exam papers to the front Hand them in quickly Quickly, please! Hurry up! You should study harder instead of cramming at the last minute Give them to me Have I got all the papers? Yes We're on holiday! We can go home! Why did you hang this on my camel's neck? Can't you see it's making his knees beed? Your came; was running wild without the block My camel is used to roaming freely. He goes where he wants, eats what he likes but you hunt this block on him. He can't run anymore You brought your camels to our region. Yugurs should observe our rules here Let's go Give me the camel fees for this month. Give them to me You're a pretty bad tempered kid Bartel, we're grownup enough to look for Mom and Dad on the prairie Let's go together Grandpa said you must visit Mom this summer Mom misses you! She only misses me because she's dying. Where were Mom and Dad when Grandpa died? If you don't go home, Grandpa's soul can't return to the grasslands. His soul will be lost forever. Bartel! We can take Grandpa and Grandma's portraits with us They will protect us on our journey home I packed up everything Dad bought you and the rest of the jerky and cheese It'll be enough for us on the way home If you want to stay here you can still come back after the summer holiday Bartel! There used to be a river here. This is fun! Stop drinking so much water. You're wasting it We should stop and rest. We can set out when the sun goes down Bartel, did you see that? No Bartel. The sun is setting. We should go Don't look for water there Dad and I took this route in the spring. The well has dried up Hey! Look! It's Fatty! This could have been his family's house Bartel! Are you scared? Stupid Dad and I passed by this village in the spring There were still a few families living here But now they've all gone Bartel, let's stop! We're lost! Bartel! I think we should head east Why should I listen to you? Dad told me to always follow the river So which river do you want to follow? I've been following the river! I don't need to listen to your garbage Dad and I walked this path to and from school every spring and summer You should listen to me! We've been guiding the camels Now let's let them loose Grandpa said camels know where to find water So let's see where they head and we'll follow them Heh! I know where we are. Dad and I always passed this empty house Bartel. Come and join me by the fire It's much warmer here If you don't want to there's still more dung. You can make your own fire Isn't it better if I freeze to death? When I was little they didn't want me I'm only going home because I told Grandpa I'd see Mom The murals describe Emperor Wu of Han sending his ambassador Zhang Qian to the Tocharian Kingdom of the Western Regions to find out the origin and significance of the statues The gold statues were presented to Wu in 120 BCE after his campaign against the nomadic Xiongnu of Central Asia Bartel! Bartel! Bartel! Have you seen my camel? Adikeer! Run faster! Mom, bring me the nose stud for the calf Alright. I'm coming Here you are I told you not to fight over your mother's milk Bartel, don't hit your dad Stop! Listen to me! Your camel will be okay If mt camel wasn't sick we wouldn't have found this place We spent summers here. The grasslands were as beautiful as gold Your camel's dying anyway. Let' kill it so we can drink its blood I hope you die of thirst! I told you not to drink so much water but you didn't listen to me Grandpa said that camels have an amazing memory They go back to their birthplace when they're dying We don't have any more water and we've miles to go Who do you think you are? Don't tell me what to do If Grandpa didn't make me promise to see Mom this summer I would never go back You think I like traveling with you? If Mom wasn't sick and didn't want to see you so much I wouldn't have asked you to come with me Everyone loves you more than me! Every winter Mom sews new wool into clothes for you and Grandpa What about me? You bastard! I hate you! We are the same! I hate you! Shit! Damn it! The favorite! Asshole! It's all your fault! If you weren't around they wouldn't have sent me to live with Grandma and Grandpa Why are you blaming me? If it was up to me I wouldn't have been born into this family Everyone likes you the best Why'd you throw sand into me eyes? You're a piece of shit! You deserved it! I hope you die. Shut the fuck up! That doesn't hurt much. He'll be fine Hey camel. Look at me I punched Adikeer hard in his chest I'm fine. He was faking it Don't you think so? Stupid camel, you're on his side Don't cry Your younger brother won't die Excuse me, Lama Have you seen a little boy a bit shorter than me? Can you give me some water for my camel? There's barely enough water for the lamas Let alone for your camel I still have several days to travel. My camel will die without water Mao Lan Yes? When you give salt to our camels can you also give some to this boy's camel? Okay You came just in time You would find no one in this temple if you came tomorrow All the lamas are going to other temples in town There's no need for this temple anymore Where did you come from? I came from the town My grandfather lived on the prairie close to town but his well ran dry He asked someone to dig a new well but there was still no water after digging 25 meters So Grandpa sold all his sheep Then we all have to go to town to find someplace with water Are you alone? Adikeer was with me Then why are you alone? Where's Adikeer? Where are you going? To his home to see his sick mom Where is his home? Adikeer says it's where the grass is lush Come here, boy Do you want water? Come with me Boy The scroll you're looking at is called "Gratitude towards Parents" Parents are dear to us They give us life. They raise us up The rivers, like our mothers, are drying up The prairies, like our fathers, are becoming impotent To live a life of gratitude you must pray for your parents This is how you repay them their love Let us pray for the recovery of your parents and our lands My child. Your father did not come to pick up you because he continues herding and is fighting to stay on the prairie We must respect him Child. This's my camel, now you can have it May Buddha bless your journey home I have something for you Go! I'll wait here for you till the day when the grass will be lush and you shall return You catch it. Dad gave me one You can't suck on that Mom says they use balloons as urine bags on planes It's true. I'm right! So when you pick it up did you see urine in the balloon? Whenever Mom cooked she always thought about you and left lots of food for you, even if you weren't there When Grandpa and Grandma came back with you and then when you left with them again Mom became very sad and wouldn't speak for days Here. You can try it No! it doesn't work like that. Do it this way First, put the string on your fingertip Then wrap it around Throw it down like this Got it! Give it to me! Here you are Hooray! We've found water Bartel! Come here! It's too hot. I'm going swimming! Bartel, aren't you hot? Come and join me Come in! Hurry up! We're almost home. There's water here If we can get home before dark Mom will cook dinner for us Mom said that the sheep she helped birth are yours The sheep that dad helped birth will be mine After we arrive home We'll have our herds and can go herding with Dad Uncle, what are you doing here? Mining for gold
