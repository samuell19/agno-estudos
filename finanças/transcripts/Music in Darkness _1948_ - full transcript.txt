MUSIC IN DARKNESS Based on the novel by Dagmar Edqvist Fire! Score. Attention! Change! - I'm not dead. - It is a pity. - I am not dead. - Poor Bengt. I think your brother is regaining consciousness, Miss Vyldeke. No! Perhaps I should call the doctor. - Blanche? - No, it's me. Would you like some water? Why don't you raise the blinds? - Schr?der Residence. - It must be for me. - Yes? - Agneta? Hello, dear. Where have you been? Why didn't you come back? My boat won. - And you're not here. - Are they all there? Yes, all the gang. Wait. Gang, it's Agneta. Did you hear that? They all say hello. It's been a magnificent day A sky so blue and the white sails. Can you imagine it? - Yes, I can see it. - Why aren't you here? - Only because your brother? - I can't leave Bengt yet. - I fear that he could? - How is Bengt, by the way? - Blanche is pretty depressed. - Really? She's no good as a nurse, nor to sacrifice herself, but? - In her own way, she loved him. - Loved? She wants to speak with you. Hello, Agneta. You will think that I was a coward for giving back the ring to Bengt. You thought that, didn't you? It was the only way out for us. Bengt is so smart. That is? He knows how sensitive I am. I'm sure he understands that I can't see him after that. Your time is over. That was Einar, who sends greetings. It's your turn, right? Here. 2000, great! You're cheating. Do you know how humiliating that is? - Just trying to cheer you up. - I don't want compassion. - It's? - I know. This is unbearable. Everything that I do bothers you. Bengt! It's as warm as in summer and the air is as clean... - as in autumn. - How many see it as a blessing? - Yes, how many? - See what the paper says. Greed makes a man break the commandments. - And then he takes his own life. - It was his life, after all. Beatrice thinks that suicide is murder. A crime against life. - We don't know what was happening to him. - Everything can be overcome. Pain and suffering are part of God's plan. - Maybe it was desperation. - Desperation? That is a momentary attack of impatience in the general plan. What's this? Bengt's watch has arrived. - Is it easy to read the time? - No Yes it is. And today he got a machine to write in Braille. Who am I going to write to, myself? - How are the exercises? - Bengt didn't feel like it. When Agneta leaves, we'll go on with the lessons. Right, Bengt? Yes. Augustin will bring the car as soon as we have coffee. Yes, Beatrice. Do you have everything, Agneta? I'm glad Bengt is staying. I don't know what we'd do. Anything wrong with the car? It's a reliable car. But it takes its time to start. Isn't that Ingrid? How are things at home? - My father has died. - Darling, come, tell me. Bengt? Mr. Vyldeke could do it. Ask him, if you want. This is Ingrid. Her father will have a funeral service. But there's nobody to play the organ. Could you do it? How I am going to do it? Bengt, it's time to begin. Bengt? Roy, Roy. Come. It thought it was the dog and it turns out to be a kitten. - It's just me. - What's "me doing on four legs? - I am mopping the floor. - Right. - Excuse me, I thought you had finished. - Almost. Please go on, it doesn't bother to me. D? E? F? - What's wrong? - Nothing. It's just that I'm like a six-year-old. I can't read. Do you know what that is? Of course. - Wait, are you going out? - Going to get some milk. - Can I go with you? - Yes, let's go. - Where were you? - I was greeting some acquaintances. What you are doing now? Dog roses. They're frozen and delicious. I was sure you'd like them, Mr. Vyldeke. - Would you like some berries? - I'll wind up in a ditch. I'm sorry, I forgot. You don't like these either? Good afternoon, Ingrid. Good afternoon, Mr. Vyldeke. I've been wanting to call you for some time. I'm Kerman. - He is the vicar. - So I've heard. Very funny. Have we had the pleasure?? - I heard you at the funeral. - Yes, you played the organ. I was looking for you afterwards. - How you are, Ingrid? - Well, thanks. Come see me when the... testament thing is solved and we'll speak of your future. Well then, come see me any time. If you want me to lend you a book? Why not? Ingrid reads well. - She could read them out loud. - I hadn't thought about that. Where the impenetrable darkness... covered that which it tried to understand. It was then when love came to free my soul. - And to those of us who love has ignored? - Don't say that. Darkness and silence had been my only experience. During a time I felt tormented... and I struck the wings of my soul against the bars that kept me locked. Now I delight? Now I delight in the robust and liberating feeling of being able to think, act and look for whatever is above me. You're laughing at me! - No, not at you. - Of course you are! No, I assure you. Please, go on. No, please. - I'm an idiot. Shall we go on? - Really? Tell me then, what was so funny? - Nothing. - I want to know what it was. You read the words in quite a monotonous manner. - And how should I read them? - As you speak. - I can't do it. - Try it. There was something here that I liked very much. Here it is. It's no longer true a single class has access... to the paradise that is knowledge. Its doors? Its doors remain open... to the poorest inhabitants of streets and alleys. - Isn't that beautiful? - But, is it true? I'd like it to be true. - She doesn't want us to go on. - We'll continue tomorrow. I'd love that. The candle? - It's out. - Take my hand. I'll take you. The scent of lavender. It's Mrs. Schr?der's sheet closet. I have recovered the fine sense of smell I had as a child. The truth is that I recognize people by their scent. - Do I smell nice? - Yes, like calfskin, like sweet milk. - Thanks for the pleasant evening. - Thanks. - You've read for quite a while. - We had permission. - We'll read many books. - Nothing good will come of it. You're a farmers' daughter, as worthy as the city folks. They may be high class, but that doesn't make them? Have you already become vain and conceited? No, just checking if I feel the freckles when I do this. You're crazy. ? access to the paradise that is knowledge. A right that the state recognizes as universal. is the right to learn. To learn? That's what I want. To stop stuttering or feeling ashamed. Get up, Ingrid. It's getting late. Have you gone mad? Getting naked to wash? That's the way it's done. Louise? - Can you give me an advance payment? - What for? I want to buy a sweet smelling soap. Like eau de cologne! Bring five kilos of flour and two tins of anchovies. - I made you some tea. - Thanks. Thanks. for? a pleasant afternoon. - Ingrid, did you write this? - Yes. - How the heck did you do it? - I saw how you did it. Funny. I've been trying for months and still can't do it... and you learned in five minutes. I don't know how I did it. I only know how to use the keys with printed letters. It was nice of you. Thanks, calfskin. Calves do it all the time. They did it at home, when I tended to them in the mornings. They have very rough tongues. To: the Director of The Royal Academy of Music. - Is there money attached? - No, just the form. I wish there was some chance of being admitted. You play so well. I get goose bumps when listening to you. No, try again. No, no. Quick, but not staccato. - I don't know to do it better. - Yes you do. Once again. I thought that you'd like some coffee. Just what we needed. It's amazing how that girl has improved. - She's very committed. - Yes, she's very sweet. - You need a wife to take care of to you. - To take care of me? Thanks. I could marry the servant. You should be ashamed of yourself! There's worse around. - In addition, she may not want you. - I have no last resort. ROYAL ACADEMY OF MUSIC RESTAURANT NEEDS PIANO PLAYER INQUIRE AT THE RITZ HOTEL - I'm Vyldeke. You need a piano player. - Well, an early riser. Take this! Bring me a beer! Make sure it's cold! What a wild time last night. Play the piano so that I can hear you. - Where is the piano? - Where is the piano?! - Are you drunk or pulling my leg? - Can't you see that I'm blind? If you had my hangover you'd know that I can't see much. - OK, let's listen to something. - What should I play? Something nice. No, I said something nice, not that noise! Yes, that's better. So says Klasson. He's my violinist. Not that I like it. I know what my customers want. It's a first class restaurant, Mr. ? - Vyldeke. - Right. I hire the musicians so that my customers get what they want. - Is this what they want? - Exactly! I'm glad you know black music, for dancing. Me, I prefer Grandfather dances the waltz.. It's not what I had in mind. But you never know, maybe women will like him. Tell me, Mr. Vildenberger or whatever, what are your conditions? - The normal ones. - 400 a month? Free food. All first class. A free beer per day. But lodging is your own thing. Although I can look for something for you. - And you must wear a tuxedo. - Not in the morning. - Why not? - Because I'm not a waiter. Heard that? I'm not a waiter.. Musicians are a conceited lot. This one takes the cake. What's wrong with wearing a tuxedo in the morning? - It's not elegant. - We'll talk about it later. - Will you sign the contract? - Yes, of course. A letter! - Do you want me to read it? - Yes, please. What you are doing? Me? Mi? What's this here? - Mira? - Miramar. My dear Bengt: thank you for your welcome letter. We're glad that you are well and that you have a boy who helps you. It's pretty quiet, here in Mir? In this damned place! ? since you left, only us old folks remain... and little Ingrid who's studying in order to graduate. But Augustin and I have each other. And even old age and solitude have their charm... when you are part of the great plan. - The great plan.. How stupid. - Shut up and continue. Lots and lots of hugs... your old friend, Beatrice Schr?der. We have to go to the restaurant quickly. - Damn door! - Hey, easy. Welcome to our business. Have a good time. - You look ridiculous with that sweater. - Yes, Sir. I'm trying to make this a modern and elegant place... and you look like two old sausages. He has no sense of humor, Klasson. - Ave Maria.. - I don't have the score. It's not enough that I look ridiculous, I also have to play with an amateur. - Can't we play decent music? - They'll throw us out. Here it comes. The maiden's prayer.. - He can't come in here. - Where is he going to eat? Her mother works and his father disowned him. Hj?rdis? What a sense of humor you have. Is there anything interesting in the newspaper? No, nothing. Have some more, Mr. Vyldeke, people could get pricked by you. - Have you been pricked, Hj?rdis? - Miss Hj?rdis to you. Damn Paganini! Behave with Hj?rdis, she can be a witch. Why do you all hate each other here? It's the owner's fault. Everything around him is poisoned. He's the devil. You're obsessed. He's a hippo, but he's not easy to hurt. And if you want to hurt him? You'd give your immortal soul to hurt to him... for all the times that he's stepped on you and spat on you, but you can't, nothing penetrates the hippo. Something is broken within you. But, what's this? We can't stay here. What a woman! - Let's eat at least. - I flatly refuse. There has to be a better place than this. - Let's go. - As you wish. Angel hair. Dyed, of course. - No, it wasn't dyed. - How do know you that? Can you lend me a ten? - Don't give me a five. - They're tens, got them at the post office. - They're all fivers. You're wrong. - I don't think so. Somebody is robbing me. I'll go to the police. He's the owner. We're his slaves, we have to accept it. - I won't accept it. - Remember one thing. It's better to be deceived by malice than by pity. I came to see if you needed anything. How long have you been conning me? It wasn't me. How do you know? Damned little crook! No, help! Let go of me! Help! Help! Have you gone mad? Look at his clothes! And you gave him a black eye! Hit him! Hit him! Yes, that's it. The police will find out about this. It will cost you dearly, little rich man. He's been stealing from me. He's confessed. Only because I was scared. You have no evidence. - Shut up, idiot. - There you have it. He hasn't stolen anything. Right, Evert? - No. Help me, mother. - Let's go, let's go. You'll hear from us. Shut up, brat! Well, dear Vyldeke. This is unfortunate. - Very unfortunate. - Yes, it is. - The boy's mother is upset. - I noticed. But if I put in a word for you, perhaps she'll accept an apology. - You want me to apologize? - Wouldn't that be the best thing for all? It would just end up as an unfortunate incident. All this was carefully planned. Let's get it over with. Do you have any evidence? Who knows if you didn't change the bills yourself? - It's your word against Evert's. - And who will they believe? That's what you will say. - And what about your accusation? - The fight? - That boy deserved a punishment. - And that's not the worse. You don't know how that poor mother felt? when she saw you struggling with her son, the torn clothes? - It's a crime. - It wasn't that bad. You speak as if I had assaulted a girl. I understand. This is what you've been plotting. A beating is what you deserve. I'm glad that you're being reasonable. You see, an accusation is as good as another. It doesn't matter if one is true and the other false? Of course not. Good bye then. It's time to come down and play. - Should I help you or should I call Evert? - I'll never go there again. Interesting news. What about that contract we signed last week? - I'll be there. - That's better. Good bye. In those days in which Nils Holgersson flew with the geese... there was a wild duck in the lake. It was a young bird that had only lived for a summer, an autumn and a winter. This one was his first spring. It had returned recently from North Africa... and had reached the lake so soon... that there was still ice on its surface. Hello? Vyldeke, I am Hedstr?m, the music director. - Hello. - Go on, I have only one question. - Why did you come to the school? - To be the piano tuner. I just found out that you're a musician. The Academy doesn't think so and I'm sick of restaurants. I'd rather be poor than play in restaurants. I give a course for church musicians. - What good would it do me? - To take the organist exam. - And to work in a small parish. - With few people. An easy place to move around, a job I'm familiar with. Is it not dishonest to choose that profession? I'm not a believer. When a priest is devout, the organist is an atheist, and vice versa. - When does it start? - You can start now. And don't be satisfied with the secondary exam, shoot higher. - What do you say? - I can't. - I just want to exist, that's all. - You have no right to be so modest. The blind community needs you. Your example will help them a lot. I can't. I don't want to. Don't insist. All right? The place is so small that when Sylvia writes on the table... I'm on my knees next to the drawer. - Ingrid! - Bengt! They're friends of mine. - Larsson. - Nord. - Vyldeke. - We were at the exams together. Now they will do the baccalaureate. - In our free time. - A correspondence course. - It's difficult, right? - Language is complicated. - Do you go to blind school? - Yes. Pardon me for meddling. Am I being a nuisance? No, not at all. It's a surprise. - I have to go to the newspaper. - Me too. Good bye. - Good bye. - Good bye. - I recognize this. - It's the same coat. Can I lean on your shoulder? How did you recognize me? I recognized your voice like when you see a familiar face in the sun. It's such a great joy. - Aren't you glad? - Yes, of course. No, that's not true. Did it bother you that I frightened away your suitors? I could have left with them. So? And why didn't you answer my letters? It seems trivial. But I didn't know how to address you. It's only logical that you thought I was an idiot. For me it wasn't easy calling you Bengt, but I had to do it in front of them. You were always Mr. Vyldeke. - My little Ingrid, darling? - I'm not little nor dear. I don't want people calling me "the servant to my back. I never said that. You said it. I'll be satisfied with those of my class. Ingrid! Wait a while and listen to me. Whatever I did, isn't it enough revenge... to contemplate our present situation? You're going up the social ladder, and I am going down. You'll soon be a teacher with a good position in society. I'm a tuner or a cafe musician or something of that sort. Bengt, enough, please. I feel terrible when you say that. The best thing is to learn to accept the truth. It won't be the truth about you. No, perhaps not all the truth. I hope. - Ingrid? - Yes? If you knew how sweet, how authentic you are, then nobody could hurt us, no matter what we did. - It's raining. - It's been for a while. What shall we do? I live close by, if you want to come. It's a very decent home, don't worry. I'm curious, what color is the wallpaper? It's something between the color of oats and green. Difficult to explain. At least it's not brown due to the tobacco. Remember when I used to read in Schr?der's kitchen? I was so scared. - You used to preach to me. - Shame on you. How I wanted to hear you voice again. I'd love to read to you, Bengt. - I'm sure you're very busy. - We can help each other. They almost rejected me at the school for not knowing how to play the piano. You can help us, the boys and me. - Ah, really? - Yes, with language. The wretched ones have to unite. That's what Ebbe says. You're broke, right? Good. So we are both at the same level. I've been wanting to be myself with somebody for a long time. - And I? - No. You haven't missed me. I've noticed it with great grief. Ingrid, how do you look now? - Do you mind if I touch you? - Of course not. I have a straight back. I no longer slouch my shoulders like before. I think the girl has grown up. - And she's very beautiful. - Think so? You didn't think that before. You didn't even know I existed. I always paid attention to you. I realized it later. - Ingrid? - No, Bengt. - Are you afraid of me? - It's not that. I must go. - I hope to see you again. - We've agreed on that. - Good night, sleep well. - Good night. - You're not going to clean it that way. - It thought you weren't going to come. - We had so much to talk about. - I'm sure. You never spoke about him before. It was in the Schr?der's house, long time ago. Poor wretch. He would be better off dead. He plays very well. He could help you with your French, by the way. Alpha cosine minus beta cosine is equal to minus two times the alpha sine minus beta divided by two. ? minus two times the alpha sine divided by two. Alpha cosine? It's me, Vyldeke. Feel like talking? I can't sleep. Neither can I. It's hard to get used to this. There's no difference between day and night. It's hard, but you get used to it. Really? Do you believe that? No, I believe you're right. You never get used to it. Just thinking that we'll never see the light of day any more? - Nor darkness. - Nor darkness? No. Light and darkness are words without sense. All cats are brown in the dark". - Something like that. - You learn to work with brushes... although your hands yearn for a hammer. Yes, it's hard. That's not even the worst thing about it, neither is being flat broke. What is the worst thing? To be separated from Elsie. - Is she your fianc?e? - No, my wife. We're just married. Just married! And this has to happen! What am I going to do? What are you complaining about? You have a woman waiting for you. Think about the rest of us. That is if Elsie can wait for me. Elsie is so cheerful and full of life. - I can't even write to her. - I'll help you. But I won't be able to read her letters! I have two here. This is driving me crazy! They can help us at the school. You don't know Elsie. Do you think it's right for a teacher to read this? I think she sent a picture with her last letter. This can't be anything else. - What is that? - A picture of the future. You shouldn't laugh about something so serious. Are you that something so serious? I'm not laughing. You'll be a great man. - This is not about me. - I understand you. You'll achieve great things. - Ingrid? - You're hurting me! - You've become quite delicate. - You know that's not so. - You think that I'm a peasant. - I want to be alone tonight. - Don't you ever want to be alone? - No, I don't want to be separated from you. - I don't think I have any secrets. - Don't you? - I don't know? - Something to do with that man? - Do you have to behave this way? - Is the subject sacred? You're behaving badly. Very badly. OK, we'll drop the subject. No. I want to be alone. What strange ideas you get into your head. - You're not upset, are you? - No, I think that there's nothing you can do. You're so sweet. - Time to leave. - Let me, you don't have to serve us. I'm sorry. I forgot my manners. Do you mind if I pound the keys? I've been practicing for months and still not improving. Of course not. Do it again and you'll see. The muscles get tight from sitting down for so long. - Ebbe has to cut down a tree. - Start with a plant. - How about a little arm wrestling? - OK. Now? Watch out for the furniture! - You fell like a tree. - You've given me a real beating. - Thanks. We're leaving. - The female takes the winner. - Why did you say that? - It's a joke, can't you see? - Ingrid is very sensitive lately. - Watch out for the blind. - They suddenly see things. - What's going on? This is getting melodramatic. Who can understand you two. Don't bother! Out, both of you. As you wish, it'll be my pleasure. - Have you seen my other shoe? - No You're lucky to have invited Ebbe. Anton always steps on you. Where could that shoe be? What you will do if the director asks you to dance? - Hello! Wake up. - What? - Do you think he'll come? - For sure. - Will there be enough sandwiches? - I made at least one hundred. You're hopeless. - You've got my shoe on. - Jesus! - You'll soon be a teacher. - I'm off. - Weren't we going together? - Yes, later. - Bengt! - Hello. - How are you? - All right. - Are we still friends? - Sure. I'm sorry about being so grouchy the last time. - Isn't your dance today? - Yes, I'm on my way. But I wanted you to see me before. You smell nice. Are you dressed already? - New Dress? What color? - Blue. - Like a forget-me-not? - No, like a bellflower. And I'm wearing daisies in my hair. - You'll think that I'm an idiot. - I think you look marvelous. Hopefully? - Don't you want to come? - No, you know I can't. - You would be the best dancer. - I would disappoint you. But I can walk with you a while. Bengt, why were you so nasty the last time? - Rivals don't get along. - Ebbe doesn't see you as a? Not as a rival. It would hurt his pride as a healthy and strong man. - That's unfair. - Possibly. Ebbe is not only Ebbe. He can see and thus turns me into an inferior being. But you're not. - He hasn't spent a single sleepless night. - What do you know about him? His father was sentenced for murder. He had to feed his family. Another point for Ebbe. Why am I talking about this? I was right about your relationship, wasn't I? Ingrid? - Hello. - Hello. I imagined you would be here. There's a good concert on the radio this afternoon. - We could listen to it together. - No, I don't have the time. - You don't have the time? - No, Elsie is coming tonight. Really? How nice. - Come to the station to greet her. - No, I can't. Yes you can. We can have a good time, the three of us. - No - Of course yes! Come with me. All right. - I don't know why I had to come. - Shut up. The train has arrived. Watch out! - What happened? - I heard somebody shout. - You seem strange. - Everything is strange tonight. Watch where you're going! Follow me. Where are you going? My God, a rat. Why didn't he get rid of them before? This is a dump. What do you want? Don't stay there. Leave! I can't stand it any longer. Bengt. - I've been looking for you. - Ingrid. I had the feeling you were lost and I couldn't find you. I thought that I would never find you again. Why did you run away? Watch the tone. Ingrid is not your property. - This is between Ingrid and I. - I'm also involved, I believe. Bengt! Thanks. This is the first time that you treat me like a normal person. Nobody can come between Ingrid and I. - Are you saying we can't get married? - Exactly. I advise you to drop this ridiculous idea. You can only stop it until she's of legal age, but we will live together. I know the way to keep that from happening. If you are the decent man that I believe you are. How? By threatening us with eternal damnation? I hope you realise that this is not pleasant for me. But as Ingrid's tutor, I have to think about her welfare. Now I'm begging you, don't take advantage of her. Le her finish her studies. You'd be doing her a disservice otherwise. Then she can make her own choice. - I've already made it. - Maybe he's right. I'm not a girl. I know what I'm doing. I've seen too many hasty marriages. I don't want you to become a bitter wife in an unhappy home. We won't be unhappy. Only if we're separated. Right? Look at it rationally. When will you graduate and get a job? - Within three years. - How will you live until then? - I have a scholarship. - And I have a pension and some help. - Does that seem promising to you? - We're better off together. Your problems won't be solved by an exam. - You need a job. - Of course. I know the council and the parish. People aren't charitable when employing the handicapped. - Am I wrong to study? - No, of course not. But you can't expect any good to come from all this. In all of Sweden there's only one blind organist. This whole education thing is a farce when the moment of truth arrives. - I didn't say that. - I have a right to try. Sure. You have an obligation to try. I must be allowed to fight for what I love, for Ingrid. - Again with that? - Yes, so it is. Please don't be angry. We're serious. We want get married. - Are you rejecting my advice? - Yes. Very well. We'll send out the invitations. Nein, nein? Rein muss Es sein. Augustin, what's with that flag? Strange, never happened before. - I don't understand. - Somebody will have to climb. Thank heavens you fixed it. I hope it's not a bad omen. - If it starts off badly? - And if you're a little kinder? Don't always feel like it. Isn't it nice of the Schr?ders do this for us? Nice? I respected you because you wanted to be a teacher. I'll go on with my studies. Not when you complicate your own life this way. Nothing's been complicated. - Aren't you pregnant? - No Why are you getting married then? The flag is stuck. Louise thinks I'm pregnant. - Surely there'll be a problem with the cake. - Listen to me. Let's get out of here. We'll escape in Augustin's car. And you'll be my lover for the next 80 years. Do you think they'll accept us as organists in the country? - We've struggled so much to get married. - That's true. - We convinced the vicar. - Yes. - That's why I'm scared of him. - Scared? He'll whisper in my ear: do you know what you're doing? You're taking Ingrid's life away. " No? I, Bengt Vyldeke Take you Ingrid Maria Olofsson... as my legitimate wife... to love you in sickness and in health. And as a symbol of our love I give this ring to you. I, Ingrid Maria Olofsson... take you, Bengt Vyldeke... as my legitimate husband to love in sickness and in health. And as a symbol of our love... I give this ring to you. Do you want to quit now? Too late. The train has left the station. - Can you hear the wheels? - I can only hear your heart. Bengt! Are you aware... we're leaving together? Yes. And this is not just any train. No. subtitles MB (scalisto) for KG.
