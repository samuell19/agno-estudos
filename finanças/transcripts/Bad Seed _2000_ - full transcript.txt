I am sick of this bullshit rain. Where is my umbrella? You said we could talk tonight. I'll be back in five minutes. We can talk about it then. I don't see why this can't wait a few minutes. This always happens. Emily, I have a headache. I'd like to get a fountain coke. Where is the umbrella? We have coke here. I know. I'd like a fountain coke. I told you. Coke out of the can tastes like coke out of the can. Preston, this can't wait. Where is that umbrella? I'm losing my fuckin' mind. Where... it's important! I'll talk about it as soon as I get back. Listen to me. Forget the coke. Forget the umbrella. I need to talk to... You know what? You're right. Forget the umbrella. I'm gonna go out. I'll be right back. Preston, I'm having an affair. I'm sorry. I had to tell you. I couldn't keep hiding it. Jesus Christ! I tried to say something before. It just happened. He flattered me. He flat... who? Who flattered you? - You don't know him. - Try me. - It's not important. - I think it's important! - Preston, I love you. - Thank you for your honesty. I'm sure it must have been hard on you to come clean. Don't do this, Preston. Don't yell. I thought I had a problem earlier when I couldn't find my umbrella. Now I hear my wife is having an affair. Was having an affair. Was having... Were you trying to get my attention? You got my attention! You didn't even notice I was gone in the first place! I didn't... so it's my fault? You're having an affair, but it's my fault. What is it? Can I talk to Emily, please? Who is this? Can I speak with Emily? - Who is it? - You can tell me who this is. Give me the phone. Hold on! Give her the goddamn telephone! You're the guy, aren't you? Jonathan, why are you calling? Jonathan? That's your name? You write me a letter saying it's over just like that? I'm not going to discuss this now. You will discuss this now. Where do you get off talking to her... would you hang up the phone! Fuck you, Preston. Just because you're too blind to realize what you've got... Doesn't change the fact that I'm the one that loves your wife. I'm the one who shows her that every single day. You're the reason why she came to me in the first place. Jonathan, stop it! Preston? Preston, wait. I want to talk to you, Preston. And there's no end in sight for this rain. Local forecast calls for light to moderate showers... In the puget sound area for the better part of the week. We're closing in on 7:30, folks, so stick around. I got a whole new single from... Emily? Emily, I'd like to talk. Emily? Emily? God! Emily? Oh, god. God. Oh. Will you get in here, please? She's got bruising around the neck. Looks like she hit her head. We got a subdural hemorrhage. Significant bleeding. Get her to the Van. Attention, all units. Can I get all available units... Officer! Wait! The man had an orange car. You saw someone? No, but I saw his car. He had an orange car. Do you know what kind of car it was? No. And after all that, you don't know his last name? Jonathan's all I know. I had never met him before tonight. I hadn't even heard of him. You're sure she was seeing him? I'm sure. Dr. Valentino to the O.R., please. Dr. Valentino to the O.R., please. Paging Dr. White. Dr. White, call your office. Lower. Nurse, we need more dressing. Stand by. We're holding on here. Going lower. Nurse, we need more dressing here. More? There's pressure on the skull here. All right. That's better. Hold that. Give me another light over here. Bring that over here. Bring it up. Open the goddamn door! You don't mind if I come in your house, do you? I got a couple of questions I'd like to ask you! I'd like to ask you what happened to my wife! I want to know what happened to her! You fucked up, pal. You got the wrong guy. Do you know what I did this morning? I spent my brother's 23rd birthday wiping the blood off of his pillow. Did you know he was retarded? Couldn't even brush his own fuckin' teeth! That's why there's a camera in his room, so I could monitor him... Just like a little baby. Let me tell you something about your wife... no... Shut up! That's the police. They'll go away. No, they won't. Fine. Who's that? Come on in, Randy! Get rid of him. Hi, Randy. I'm sorry we missed the reception. It's okay. We're on our way out of town. We have to go see my mother. Tess made lasagna for you. I'm going to put this in the fridge. Great. I don't think we've met. I'm Randy. Nice to meet you, Randy. How do you suppose he's holding up? He's doing okay. Are you sure? Did you go out to the cemetery? I didn't make it. You a friend of the family? You know Emily? Yeah. Oh, you know both of them? Where are you from? You from down at the, uh... Did you work with them? No, no, no. I know them from before. From before? Listen, when he does that lasagna, tell him high temperature. You get those nice crispy... We were having... I'm sorry. I've got to run myself. Yeah, yeah. Mr. Tylk, Tacoma police. Open the door. Mr. Tylk, we just have a few questions. Will you open the door, please? All units, be advised. 187 suspect, white male, six-two, brown hair, brown eyes. Last seen wearing red jacket and gray pants. Last seen at 423 reegan street. Last name is tylk. "T" as in Tom, "y," young, "l," Lincoln, "k," king. Responding to party stating suspicious activity at 1800 hours. Suspect fled scene. Currently wanted for questioning. Be advised, code six-David. 187, copy. Goddamn rain. Hello? I swear to god I'm going to make you suffer. How did you get this number? Your wife. What are you looking for? Where are you? Close enough. How'd you find me? I followed you from the diner. I knew you'd go there to think. You always go there to think. Worked out for me though. Every time you sorted things out over a corned beef sandwich and a coke I was fucking your wife. What do you want from me? I want to watch you suffer, then die. I'm going to the police. Yeah. Fine. You go to the police, I'll give them a copy of our home movie. You know the one where you murder my brother? They've already got the tape. The police are at my house right now. They won't find anything. Tape's not there. Wait a second. What the hell is going on? What the hell are you doing in my kitchen? Hey! Hey! Hey! What the fuck! Where's the tape? Where is it? Gonna kill me like you did my brother? Where's the tape? Where is it? Come on, murderer! Pull the trigger. Do it! Open sundays, 10:00 till 7:00. Shut the door, will ya? You're letting all the hot air out. Uh, you open? I'm awake. My name's Preston tylk... Do me a favor, will ya? Will you walk straight from the door to this chair and take a seat? It's awfully warm in here. I'm from Florida. The wife moved me out here and then dumped me. Cold air chaps my lips. That's why I like it hot. I hate the rain. Me too. Before we go on, I should let you know a few things. I get a lot of nut jobs that walk in here. Pimps, whores, junkies, winos wanting to get in out of the rain. Since I am a 24-hour operation, I take certain precautions for my safety and yours. Am I clear? Yeah, yeah, I think so. Good, because I store a gun under my desk. It's easy for me to grab, and right now I have it pointed at your dick. Please don't get alarmed. After we converse and I feel more comfortable, I will extend to you the courtesy of placing both of my hands on the desk. This does not obligate you to hire me and certainly does not obligate you to stay. Now, my business card says Richard, but you may call me dick. Now, please, tell me. What is your situation? I'm trying to find something, and, uh, well, I'm being blackmailed. How? Videotape. Videotape. Of what? Well, I can't actually say. I mean, that's why I came to you. I just need help finding the tape... I can help. I can help. I can always help. That is, I can always help someone with deep pockets. - Do you have deep pockets? - How much? To find the tape? Yeah. $300 deposit. I get $30 an hour. That's a lot. The police are looking for you, aren't they? Why do you say that? 'Cause they've been talking about you on my scanner all night. They think you killed your wife. I didn't. Do you have any proof of that? I don't think that this is gonna work out. Do you have any evidence who did do it? Who might have done it? Thank you for your time. I appreciate it. I'm sorry if i... If I were you, young man, I wouldn't walk out of here. I think you need my help. How's that? You can't go to the police because you're being blackmailed. You can't stop the guy who's blackmailing you because he's got you by the short hairs. If I were a betting man, and I am, I would bet that once you had the tape... You can go to the police, clear your good name and they'll catch the real bad guy, right? Something like that. Then I'm your man. Please, sit down. Have a lemon wedge. I will match or beat any price out there. I offer the most competitive price in town. However, I will need a $200 deposit, and my rate is $30 an hour. That, I'm afraid, is just not negotiable. You just said you needed $300 for the deposit. I'm cutting you a deal. It just all sounds kind of like a sales pitch. The most unique animal in the world is a u.S. Marine. The second is a police officer. Let me tell you why. Marines take orders. They go into combat, and a lot of them die. Police officers do the same thing, only they look for answers. Whether it's the right answer or not doesn't matter. They leave that for the jury to decide. They just need an answer. For a man in your situation, that can be a very dangerous thing. You better face it, Mr. Tylk. Your number is up, and you need help. Now, if there's someone out there with incriminating evidence you want found, I'll find it for you, no questions asked. But, as I said, my rate... Well, that's just not negotiable. - I've only got about $160... - I'll take it. There's a little place just south of town, the blue spruce. Get a room. Don't answer the phone, and don't answer the door until you're sure it's me. I'll be there in the morning. Okay. You will have the rest of my money, won't you? Okay. August 3. I met a woman at the bakery today. She looked sad, empty, but at the same time, she's absolutely gorgeous. Not gorgeous in a sexy way, but in a genuinely pretty, classy way. She came in for a poppy-seed muffin. August 26. I saw Emily again today. That's her name... Emily. She's been coming in for about a week now. You know when certain people walk into your life and just control a room? She's one of those people. September 4. I did it. I finally got the nerve to walk up to her and say, "look, I know I'm a stranger to you. "I won't be offended if you slap me, but I've got to ask. May I take you out for dinner?" I swear I about swallowed my tongue. Emily came over for dinner, and we had a great time. Ended up fooling around all night. Just kept getting more and more intimate. It was light when I closed my eyes and dark when I opened them. Emily has a husband. Never had that happen before. How slimy. It's so weird. I mean, to feel that close to someone and realize they're sharing that intimacy. I feel a bit betrayed. I don't know if I feel guilt or pride. But Emily wants to be with me and not her husband. What a character. I wonder what he'd do if he knew that she felt this way about me. Brought you some clothes, coffee, doughnuts. You have the rest of that dough you owe me? Now, did he try to call you last night? He called twice last night. I didn't answer it though. But he knows I'm here. How do you know it was him? You just said you didn't answer it. I feel that he's watching me. He's not wasting any time, huh? All right, now, listen, Preston, I want you to pay careful attention to the background. See if you hear anything. Trucks, music, birds, anything like that. If he asks you, tell him you're alone. Hello? You should have seen the look on your face last night. Did you tell the detective how you destroyed the murder weapon? How did you get this number? I called the front desk. Let me talk to the detective. He's not here. Goddamn it, Preston! Quit fucking around and put him on the phone. - He wants to talk to you. - What? He knows you're here. Yeah? So you decided to help my friend, huh? Yeah, that's right. What do you want? I want you to leave him alone. He's a big boy. Let him fend for himself. I'll pay you twice what he's paying you to walk away. Pretend you never met Preston. Twice, huh? That's a very interesting proposition. However, I have met him, and he is my client. It's not worth it, dick. You're in too much danger. Let me be the judge of that. What do you think I am? Somebody you can offer a bribe to and then I'm going to disappear? Let me tell you. The most unique animal is a United States marine. Is that a yes? I told you I already have a client. If you'd like to hire me, I'm going to be tied up for the next few days. However, give me a call at the end of the week, I'll see if I can't fit you in. I am a 24-hour operation. Do what you want. But nothing's going to stand between Preston and me. If I have to drive a knife through your heart to get to his, I will. You think you're going to drive a knife through my fuckin' heart? I'll take that same fuckin' knife and stick it right up your ass! What'd he say? Cheap, idle threats. Means nothin'. Well, this is it. What are you doing? Find out where he's calling from. Operator. What city, please? Yes, Tacoma, Washington, please. 253-195-2240. Would you give me a cross-check on an address, please? I have an address listed at 609 1/2 north Jefferson street. That's listed to a Mr. Jonathan Casey. Thanks. That's where he's at. 609 1/2 is upstairs. Must be some kind of a loft. He probably already left. We'll stick around a little while longer. I just don't feel that this is a very good idea. You're right. Let's go in. Shouldn't we knock first? Somebody could be inside. I always found it a better policy... Not to knock while you're committing a burglary. Psst! Hey. I've only got one pair, so don't touch anything with your left hand. I told you to mind your own business. Put your hands up. Put your hands up. We're leaving. He's not going anywhere. Shut up! What's going on? Come in! Shut your mouth! Come in! Come in! Come in! Come in! - Where's the tape? - Why would I tell you that? - Where is it? - Fine. Shoot me. You'll never get the tape that way. No, no. Don't shoot, Preston. Don't shoot him. - Where's the fucking tape? - Shoot me already! No! Don't! Don't do anything stupid, Preston! Don't listen to him! All you want is the tape. I don't doubt you're crazy enough to pull the trigger. But think about it first. The cops are on their way up. You two broke into my place. You're spilling blood all over my floor. My employee saw both your faces. Have fun explaining this. Pull it out. Oh, Jesus Christ. Pull it out. Dick, hold on. I'll do it. Hold on a second! Come on. We got to move. Come on. We gotta get out of here. We gotta move. Put this under your arm. Move! Move! Go! Go! Take point. Take point. Let's go. Move! This is a bad idea! There's nothing much we can do about it now, is there? That guy saw our faces! Will you calm down? I said there's nothing we can do about it! Let me drive the car. I gotta think! Goddamn. - Did you get the tapes? - Yeah. Let me just think. I'll get US some help. - Dick. - Hello, Dillon. You can't be in my room! You owe me money, you shit! I mailed it yesterday. Bullshit you mailed it yesterday! Don't lie. What happened to your hand? Who's this? He's my friend. He needs your help. Sorry to hear that. Get out of my apartment. We need your expertise. No, no, no. No way, dick! You do this for me, I'll wipe out your debt. - I wouldn't know where to start. - Start what? Who is this? He's a medical student. Premed, dick. The kid is a genius. He's gonna fix your arm. He's just a kid. I said no! How old are you? 19. - Come on. - I haven't passed anatomy yet. I'm in a spot here. Unless you can cough up with the money you owe me, you better find some ointments and tools and start fixing his arm. We're bleeding all over! You make it sound like fixing a car. Just do it, okay? I'm sorry! Do it now. Come on. You're getting carried away. Get your hands off me! Jesus Christ! Are you going to fix his arm? You're lucky there's an exit wound. The bullet's not still in your arm. Great. Yeah, it is great. All right, man. Ow! Sorry. This is going to burn a little. Oh! Would you quit eating those? They're expensive. How's your fiancee? huh? The girl, the one I was following. How is she? - We broke up. - You broke up? Why? She wasn't seeing that other guy. I told you. She found out I hired you to follow her. She broke up with me. - Said I broke her trust. - She dumped you, huh? Hmph. I really feel bad about that. Don't lose too much sleep over it. Affairs of the heart are always tricky, always tricky. Don't make it too tight. All right. You'll cut off my circulation. I won't cut off your circulation. Emily and I are getting more serious. At least I am. I think about her every day now. Never been this consumed by anyone. Emily came over today and met art. They really hit it off. I think he trusted her smile. I sometimes envy the way he sees the world. Everything is so simple and pure. It's refreshing. She talked about Preston today. He still doesn't have any idea what's happening. He's so consumed with himself that he doesn't even realize she's gone. - Guys? - What is it? They followed US here. Shit! What the fuck? Shut up, Dillon. Got a car? No. I mean, yeah, but you can't use it. Give me the keys. I already helped you guys out. Give me the keys! I fixed you up. Now I'll owe you. That's how it works. Give me the fuckin' keys. You can't use my car. Come here. Look out there. See that blue dodge diplomat without the hood? See the police? Listen carefully. You have just harbored a fugitive. You gave care and refuge to two men who are wanted by the police. If I go out there and get arrested, I'm going to tell the police you are the one guy we could turn to. On the other hand, if you help US get out of here, I won't remember your name. Remember this. Where's your car? The blue Volkswagen. That one's mine. Jesus Christ. That's only two stalls away from our car. Why don't we take that? Where the fuck did you... Watch how you talk to me! Is there another way out? The north door. I like the north door. That's where you're going to pick US up. Pick you up? In what? In your car. There's cops all over it. If you can't get your own car away from a policeman, then I'm up shit creek. We all know what that means, don't we? Confidence. That's what builds a man. Use your bean. Get that car. Two guys we've been looking for. One's a white male. What's up, man? Hey. This is a crime scene. What do you need? Uh, nothing. This is my car. I was trying to get it out. What happened here? Shit. Just keep walking. Keep walking. We got a tip about a couple of guys we're looking for. Maybe you can help US. One's a white male... no, there's just college kids around here. And girls. Lots of girls. If I see anything, I'll be sure to call campus police. Or should I call you directly? I don't know how it works. Avery! Avery! Avery! Look, man, just turn around! Let me talk to you! Get his other hand. Bring it back. Don't fight US, buddy. Head down. Hey! How's it going? All right. Everything all right? Hey! Get out of my car. Shh. Be quiet. What's going on? Watch the arm, please. Yeah, watch his arm, will you, please? Who are you? We're the police, and we need your car for police purposes. The police are over there. We're special police. Okay, wait one second. All right. Tell me something. - I don't know what to say. - Tell me why you like me. You flatter me. How? I feel beautiful when I'm with you. Pretty. I like that. It's not my charming disposition that drives you mad? Yeah, I mean all that too. But you know what it is? It's just always really new with US. We laugh. What about Preston? Jonathan... Jonathan, don't do that. I'm just asking questions. I love Preston. He's just really absorbed in his work. Which is fine. He loves his work. We've changed. That newness... Just wore off. It never came back. I don't want to talk about it anymore. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to bring up anything. That's fine. That's fine. I just... turn it off. Come on. Okay. All right. You sure? Yeah, it's off. Don't worry about it. No, I don't think so. Why not? I'd do anything for another chance. What really happened, Preston? I didn't even know she was gone. Well, if she was so important... If she was so important to you, and he killed her, why haven't you gone to the police? I killed Jonathan's brother. I didn't mean to. It was a mistake. He killed my wife. I understand if you tell the police. Preston? Preston? Preston? Preston, open the door. Preston? Preston, open the door! Come on, Preston! Open the door! Oh, Jesus Christ! Preston! Open the goddamn door. Open the door, Preston. Jesus Christ, Preston! Open the door! Preston! Preston! I was married for 12 years. Then one day my wife decided that it just wasn't working anymore. Before she took my daughter and moved to Florida, I'd see her every once in a while at a movie, at a restaurant. I remember... Seeing her with a guy... Or a couple of guys over the years. Who they were really didn't matter. Just that it wasn't me, you know? I saw her in a grocery store one sunday morning. She was with this guy, and they were buying bacon and eggs, just like we used to do. I felt... That that should be me, that no matter what... He wouldn't know her as good as I did, even though he was taking my place. What I'm saying is, I... Know how you feel. What happened to your daughter? hmm? Your daughter. You said she took her. Yeah, she did. She was with her mother in Florida for quite a while, and then she went away to school to study art design... In London, england. We never really kept in touch. She always heard Jackie's side of the story. Thought I never wanted to visit her. That wasn't the case. I just never had the dough. So it's been a long time? Goin' on eight years. Take a look at this. - She's getting married. - Yeah. Yeah. Oh, I would never give her away or anything. No, no, no. That's her stepfather's job now. But she did invite me. When is it? The 28th. Gee, you know, dick, that... Congratulations. I'm... Is it in town here? Oh, no. She lives in London now, you know. When do you go over there? I don't know that I am. But, I mean... wait. What are you saying? It seems like you gotta go, right? No, see, you don't understand. It's... It's like I'm not her father anymore. You see, uh... I would feel strange, awkward. It wouldn't be right. Hello. I'm sitting here, and I can't think of anyone I loathe more than you. But I want to be humane about this. I want to be fair to anyone who actually cares about you... Because I wish somebody would have been fair with me. You call any friends, any family you may have. You tell them whatever you like, but you say good-bye. You're gonna die tonight. Call him back. Hang up the phone. There's no answer. Hang up the damn phone! Call again. Jesus Christ, he's in the next room. Dick, it's locked! Look out! Dick! I'll get the car! Hold him, Preston! I'm coming, Preston! Get him, Preston. Get this bastard. Where is it? Where's the tape? Where's the... where's the tape? I got it. I got it. Fuck. That's for my hand, you asshole! You want to put that thing away? So where we going? Be quiet. Maybe I know a better route. This is a fine route. Just keep going. Preston, could you turn down the heater? I'm starting to sweat. I like it hot. Make it hotter. It's giving me a headache. If I got to take away every thing that matters to you, I swear I'm gonna break you. Hey. I'm gonna kill you. Shut up. Do you condone what he did? The guy's a murderer. You know what he did, and you're gonna help him get away. How does that feel? It makes me feel real good. Now just shut up. Do you know how he did it? While my little brother was asleep. You better stop. He was sleeping, and Preston broke in... And smashed his skull with a bookend until he stopped moving. He buried the body, drove back home and forgot that it ever happened. And you know about it. You're sick. Maybe if I was Preston, I'd do the same thing. That makes it okay? I know what you're capable of. You don't know shit. I know what jealousy does to a man. Shut up! You're a fucking prostitute anyway. You get paid for your services, and you do any fucking thing he says. What about the truth? Does it mean anything? That's not why you get paid, is it? No, it's not. But I do get paid to check into the background of assholes like you, to see if I can't dig up any dirt, which I did. So be careful. I might know more than you think I know. You don't know anything. I know about your brother. I know you hit your seven-year-old brother so hard... That you made him a fucking vegetable. I know that you felt so bad that you spent the next 14 years looking after him. So don't sit there and spit morality tales out to me because I know better. Now keep your fucking mouth shut! Honking Hey! He took our car! He had a gun. Wait here. I'll go get help. We can't move. Hey! We've had an accident out here on highway 18, a couple miles out of town. We've got a station wagon upside down in the middle of the road. The passenger's with me, says he's all right. In local news, police continue their search... For suspected felons Preston tylk and Jonathan Casey. Both men are considered prime suspects and are wanted for questioning... In the murder of tylk's wife Emily. Although witnesses confirm Casey was at his sugar bee bakery the night of the murder, his sudden disappearance has since made him a key suspect in the killing. Anyone with knowledge of the case should contact the Tacoma police department... Or your local law enforcement agency with information. Art, pick up the phone, all right? Look, if you're there, pick up the phone, okay? I want you to go to bed. Try to get some sleep. You can't be mad at Emily. She didn't mean what she said. She was just mad. It was like a mistake. I don't want to hurt her. I just got angry too. Just go to sleep. We'll have birthday cake tomorrow, all right? Art, why aren't you picking up the phone? I'm gonna come home and check on you soon, all right? I'll be there soon. 7:26 P.M. We're closing in on 7:30, folks. Art, pick up the phone. I'm at the bakery now. I'm gonna come home and check on you soon. I'll be there soon. 7:26 P.M. You can't be mad at Emily. She didn't mean what she said. Art, why aren't you picking up the phone? 7:26 P.M. You're late. I'm here. Where's dick? You sound upset. Where's dick? He's not dead. Where are we? Nowhere. That's the point. Jesus Christ. What? You're gonna light me on fire? Is that it? I know about your brother. You don't know shit about my brother. I know he killed my wife. What did you just fucking say? I said I know about your brother. I know that he did it. Don't try to blame this on my brother. What are you talking about? He killed Emily. No, you got mad when she told you about US, and you killed her. That's not true. I got angry, but I left the house. Art broke in while I was gone. You're bullshitting me. I'm not. Art broke in while I was gone. You called him at home. He wasn't there. I heard the answering machine. He was asleep. He wasn't asleep. It was 7:30. He was at my house, strangling my wife... Because she said she was leaving you for me. Shut your fucking mouth! Is that why you're doing this? You think I killed Emily? Shut your mouth! Help! Preston! Help! Preston! Guess this is it here, huh? Yeah. I suppose you're free and clear now. Yeah, I know. You get that money? I did. I did, yeah. Listen, I appreciate that. Because sometimes it's very difficult to collect. I'm sure. Yeah. All right. Take care of yourself. Tacoma police. My name's Preston tylk. I've killed a man. Hi, Preston. Hi. How are you holding up? I'm all right. Good. Did you tell these people I talked you into giving yourself up? Yeah, I did. But we both know that I didn't. They don't know that, though. I mean, dick, you didn't do anything wrong. Look, I, uh... This is what I deserve. I got you something. - Write this down, okay? - Yeah, hold on. Okay. Okay, I got it. What is it? - Reservation number. - Reservation number for what? Your daughter's getting married, dick. She invited you to her wedding. You bought me an airline ticket? Dillon made the call. Dick, you know, don't mess this up. She's too important to you. I... I just don't believe that you did this, Preston. You wouldn't have bought it for yourself. You wouldn't even have gone. I probably won't be able to go anyway. You know me. Find a way. Thank you, Preston. Thank you very much. I... Thanks. Look... I better get going. Yeah. Yeah. Hey, dick, they... Find Jonathan? No. No, they... They don't know where to look for him. Hey. Do you remember how you wouldn't eat the peanut butter and jelly sandwiches... If I cut them in half... Because you said they were "broken"? Do you remember how we used to watch TV on mom's old couch? Did you really think that I was gonna be happier without her? I tried to fix it. I tried to make him realize what he did to you, but, art, I can't make him sorry. I drove by the house, and there's police everywhere... Going through all of our stuff. I can't go home. I don't know what to tell them. What, that I love my brother? So many questions. I just thought maybe I could make things different somehow... But I can't bring you back. Without you and Emily... I feel like I'm the only one left here. They all want answers, and I hate that. I hate that feeling. I've never known what it's like to not take care of you, art. I don't know if you're waiting or if you need help... Or maybe everything's okay where you are now. Move away from the car now! I can't face this by myself, art. I don't want to stay here alone. Put it down and put your hands up now! Closed-captioned by captions, inc. Los Angeles
