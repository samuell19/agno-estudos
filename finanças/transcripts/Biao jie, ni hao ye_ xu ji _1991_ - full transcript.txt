Hello, uncle wu since my return, I've done well in hk and learned much about hk police management so I am the chief of detectives in lien ping and teaches at a training centre besides sheng I have an excellent martial artist helping me out investigations and training Since China's open-door policy, we've had many foreign visitors so we security officers must learn some foreign language when a foreigner is dissatisfied with something he would say sheng, tell them how yes if a foreigner were hit by a car and was painful he would say, "oh, shit!" Oh, shit! Say "good morning" as greetings before noon good morning if I meet you, I say "I meet you" I meet you if you meet me if you meet me what would you say? You meet I you meet I what if we both meet him? We say "we meet him" captain, what does bbq mean as said by most Hongkong men? Bbq is the name of a bridge in Hong Kong it is picturesque and warm as spring most families enjoy barbecuing over there on Sundays it was named bbq because someone in this name liked barbecuing he was burnt to death while barbecuing there so people called that place bbq to commemorate him well, all for today next week I'll teach you German What's the best weapon to catch a thief? A gun wrong, a thief is still innocent until he is proved guilty therefore, don't use guns unless absolutely necessary besides, we must not only be powerful in attacking we must endure the agony when getting hurt we must never disgrace the public security bureau hsu hu, ready yes god, you fight harder! Fight!

A swollen mouth and a flat nose imply one with learning right, bald above and contraction below show fickleness and inertia demonstrates an evil mind this is physiognomy, not an autopsy it's a waste of time and efforts no, these data are most useful at least it deepens our understanding of the deceased What's this? Crumbs from camphorwood last year a furniture plant making camphorwood chests emerged in this town the deceased might have been there let me question the factory secretary you know him? No - Never seen him? - No tsai, have you ever seen this man? No How many men have you got in your factory?

Go Wait for me Sheng what are you two doing alone? She wants me to teach her esp your eyes are all red you may have lost your chastity if I had returned later what good is chastity? One sperm equals 7 drops of blood chastity is for a lifetime once gone, it never returns why are diamonds so valuable? Because they are rare if you lose your chastity, you lose your esp how are you going to repay your country who cultivated you? How do you know no chastity means no esp?

It feels at ease when the uneasy clouds roll by a fairy cave by nature presents infinite landscape at a dangerous peak the following are lei feng's maxims a revolutionary should place revolution above anything else and dedicate all himself to the party cause only then can he be happy what are you doing? Not my fault, you lean over by yourself not your fault? Of course not crazy, don't ever tell others about it who? What has become of this?
