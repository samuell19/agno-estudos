As the Earth continues to heat up and devastating droughts and famine plague the population, science is looking for a new planet on which human life can thrive. And it finds that in year 2063. The blue indicates water. The red is oxygen. This is our best chance to find a habitable planet. One we can colonize and so ensure the survival of our species. With the deteriorating situation here on Earth, it's essential we send a scouting mission as soon as possible. The voyage there will take 86 years. So, the crew will reproduce onboard the ship, and their grandchildren will be the ones who reach the planet. Nobel laureate in physics, say hello to MIT bio-engineer. Our first challenge was finding 30 qualified crew members able to cope with the stress of prolonged confinement. That and the knowledge that they won't be coming back. Our solution, breed and raise our own crew. Train them in isolation so they won't miss Earth. Then the next step is to assess when they'll be ready to go. The younger they are, the longer we can conserve resources and extend the timeline of the mission. But they will be on the ship alone. And while I have every confidence in our education and management system, I'm most concerned that they be able to combat the dangers they may face along the way. Some we're just beginning to understand. Decontamination complete. - Richard! - Richard! Richard. How would you solve that one? Good. Sleep well, Christopher. Sleep well, Sela. Sleep well, Zac. I'm scared. Of what? I don't know. There's nothing to be scared of. You're safe. I want to go with them. It's a one-way trip, Richard. There is no coming back. You'll die up there. I'll die down here eventually. Seems the same to me. The whole reason we're raising them this way is for their mental health. So they don't miss wide open spaces, sunlight, people. Now you, on the other hand, are going to have a hard time dealing with... I wouldn't miss a thing. It's not part of the plan. I know, I know, but think of it like this. You'll be able to launch sooner if I go with them. Four years instead of seven. Someone should be there to raise them. To protect them. You know I'm right. T-minus 15 seconds. We are go for launch. 13, 12, 11... Switch from GLC to OBC. ...6, 5... Go main engines. ...3, 2, 1... - All right. - You good? Yeah. - Good luck. - Thank you. Hatch closing. TEN YEARS LATER You are the link between past and future generations and have been entrusted with the survival of our species. You will have children onboard the ship, and your grandchildren will be the ones to reach the planet. On-ship reproduction will occur via artificial fertilization and incubation during each generation's 24th year in order to maximize resources. Well, we're the first generation, so we won't ever see the planet. We'll never know what they discover. That's true. Our lives are unimportant. No, your life, my life is as important as anyone's. Here or on Earth. Let me show you something. Not supposed to let anyone see these. That is my father and his parents. My grandparents. I never knew them, but I know they lived an honest life. You know, they took care of their family, they provided for the future. That's all any of us can do. What's up? There's a toxin in the irrigation water. Well, replace the filter and test it again. It's coming from us, it's in our urine. Yeah, it's from something we've eaten. Are we eating something toxic? Maybe toxic for a plant that relies solely on water, but you're stronger than that. What is it? What's the chemical? I don't know. Just change that filter. Hey. What do you make of this? It's an ingredient in something we eat. Why would that be unavailable? Let's go. How'd you get past the firewall? By connecting directly to the processor. It's the same way I got into the design plans. - Hmm. - Try "Nutrition." It's not there. Is it some kind of vitamin? Maybe medication. Here we go. "...the active ingredient in daily beverage A.02." "Combine with blue alkaline syrup "to counter stomach irritation." Blue. It's the blue. "...effect is enhanced when consuming it with food." What effect? I thought it was just an enzyme for digestion. "...personality becomes dull and docile..." "...eliminates sexual desire and sensation..." "...decreased pleasure response..." Decreased pleasure response? I want increased pleasure. They're drugging us. So they can control us. Pacify us. They don't want us to reproduce naturally. They don't want us to have sexual relations. So we don't feel what that feels like. And so we don't overpopulate the ship. To conserve food. I don't care. I'm not drinking it. So, Richard lied to you. The mission lies. What else aren't they telling us? Well, Christopher found a hidden compartment. In the ship's plans. Where is it? In Pod-23. Unmarked behind a wall. What's inside? I don't know yet. Don't tell Richard you went off the blue. He's going to force them back on it anyway. Yeah, maybe. By then, we'll know what it feels like. What does it feel like? Has anything changed since you stopped? - Yes, but... - Where's my pleasure? Here. Ow. A little jolt. - A bolt. - A bite. You know that's a waste of electricity. Go away. So... What have you been thinking about since our last session? Nothing. Come on, nothing? Well, I guess I was wondering why do you lie to us? What do you think I lied about? Well, I found out that... What? There's an unmarked compartment. Pod-23. Well, mission withholds certain information for various reasons. You know, even from me. It's not quite lying, but I get what you mean. How'd you find it? I just did. What's inside? I don't know. I don't know. It must be for the third generation. But why's it hidden? Aren't you curious? I am... It's probably reserved for them. It's for your grandchildren. That's a profound thought. I mean, you're going to have children, and you're going to have grandchildren. What do you think about that? Yeah, they're normal kids. They're sensitive and smart which means they know when I'm not telling them the truth. And that's my point. I want to be honest with them about everything. Otherwise, they'll lose faith in me. So... I'm going to need a quick response from you on this. That's all for now. Sela? What? You look different. I'm the same. No, you're not. Neither am I. What are you talking about? I don't know. You've changed. Everything about you. Yeah, I've grown up. That's exactly what I want to talk to you about. You have, but you're not feeling what I'm feeling. No grabbing, Zac. I wasn't grabbing. Easy with the hands. You know the rules. Yeah! Yeah! C'mon. I hate those noises. Anything? No. So what's causing the sounds? Richard says it's the cooling and contracting of the ship when we power down. I don't think the temperature differential is enough to affect the structure that way. Plus, Richard's a liar. So what is it? You think it's something on the outside, don't you? If there's life on the planet, why not out here? What else can explain those sounds? What is it? Sage. Plant that grows in warm climates. Pine needles. - It's beautiful. - Hmm. You see that? He can touch her. But I can't. We've lost contact with Earth because overnight there was a malfunction in the LCT transmitter. I'll have to go exterior to fix it. Zac will come with me. And the rest of you know your roles. Right here. - Here you go. - Thanks. This sensor goes on your wrist and it attaches here, but it's tricky because it can come loose, so just make sure... Make sure you pull the cuff over the inner sleeve so that it... Hey! Hey! Hey! What's happening here? Zac, what are you doing? You're going to lose food rations if you don't tell me what's going on. You okay? I'm fine. Zac! Zac. Zac. Phoebe, have you seen Zac? No. But I heard what he did. Has he done anything like that before? I don't know, but he stopped taking the blue. Are you sure? I saw him pour it out. Christopher. You seen Zac? You heard what he did? Oh, you think that's okay? No. Good, I'm glad to hear it. He's not taking the blue. Are you? Why would I? It's a drug. You're drugging us. Mission made a decision to administer medication to help with impulse control. To prevent exactly this kind of thing from happening. It's the only way to deal with living like this. We didn't ask to be here. Nobody chooses what they're born into. But you have to find a way to live your life. You gotta decide what kind of person you want to be. You gotta try to be good. Why? We're just gonna die in the end, so why can't we do what we want? What's the difference whether we're good or not? - There's a big difference. - Well, I don't see it. Are we still doing the repair? Yeah. C'mon. All right, put this on. - Why? - You're coming with me. I don't want to go. Look, I get that you're angry, but I need your help with this. And the sooner we fix it, the sooner you can voice your objections to mission control. I'll back you up. Depressurization in progress. 90%. 80%. Kai, you ready in the systems room? Yes. Control room set. Med Bay on 1 with vital signs. Depressurization complete. Opening hatch. Who's with him? Christopher. We're at junction box 1. Starting the repair. Shut down power to LCT 1 transmitter. Copy that. LCT 1 shutting down. Opening junction box 1. Copy that. LCT 1 repair complete. Going to LCT 2. Copy that. LCT 2 shut down. There it is. It's just the ship. Richard told us what it is. Do you see anything? Because there's nothing there. Richard! Richard! Richard! Do you read me, Richard? - What happened? - I don't know. Switching to emergency power. Check the breakers. We have a fire in the systems room. Navigation errors. I don't know. We're trying to check. Negative. No effect. Communications. The whole system's down. We're not transmitting or receiving. No, keep the oxygen. We're going to go again. It's not working. Are you pronouncing him dead? It says the chief medical officer should note the time of death. Okay. 14:35 ship time. I just don't understand. What actually happened? You didn't see it? I was facing the other way. There was that sound. Creaking. Just before it happened. Was anyone watching the monitor? Yes. We didn't see anything. I did. And? What'd you see? It looked like... Like a force jumping into him. What do you mean? Like a meteoroid? He means something else. Something alien. What? It's okay. It's going to be okay. What's going to happen to us? We'll be okay. Whatever it was, it was on the outside. We're safe inside the ship. But without Richard... We were going to be on our own at some point anyway. It just happened early. If we keep it together, we'll be all right. System restarting. Did you get an image? Everything recorded is gone. So we can't see what happened? The fire in the systems room destroyed the surveillance archive. The program says we need to choose a new chief officer. I'll be chief officer. I'm head engineer now, it makes sense that I be chief. Well, what about Sela? She's head medical officer. I don't want to be chief. It says everyone gets a vote. We have an election. And the new chief officer is... Christopher. - Congratulations. - Thank you. First thing we have to do is repair the damage. The LCS is down, so we won't be hearing from Earth until we fix it. We're on our own now, but we can work our way out of this. We'll need the entire crew in the damaged area working on the repairs. The fire knocked out most of the systems room. We'll look at electrical and communications first. Pull out all the burned equipment and replace it. Then we'll work on the surveillance system. Try to get it up and running so we can see what really happened to Richard. Okay. Edward said the fire destroyed all the surveillance. Yeah. The connections are burned. But maybe the drives are still intact. Hey. You okay? Yeah. What are you doing in here? I'm supposed to destroy his personal archive. Why? It's in the program. They don't want us to see it. Do I have to do it? Yes. Of course. That's Richard when he was ten. That's his sister. That's his parents. His parents... We only have genetic donors. It's the same. Is it? We still get our natures from them. Why did he show you all this? He wanted someone to talk to. What else? What do you mean? We saw... We saw him touching you. And we thought that you and Richard... I didn't do anything with Richard. We were just friends. He showed me his things. He would tell me about his life. But why? He felt alone. Day 1,240. I'm not gonna be able to keep up the count... It's hard to explain. On one hand, I... I didn't feel like I had anybody at home. The kids seemed like my only relationship, so... I didn't want to lose that. And then, on the other hand, I believe it's a noble mission, in the great tradition of exploration. You know... What's out there? Why are we here? Where are we going? I won't get to see the answer, but maybe I can move us a little closer to it. But I think the real reason why I came is, I wanted to make sure they're okay. And I want to protect them. Protect us from what? Everything okay? Yes. How's it going with the surveillance? Not sure yet. Where is everyone? Hey, what's going on? Why isn't everyone at their jobs? We have to repair the damage. We have to secure the ship. What are you doing in here? Bit of an emergency. That short circuit cut the power to the refrigerators. We're doing everything we can to get them back before we lose any food. Oh. Somebody should have told you. - Can you fix it? - Yes. But there's a bunch of food we need to eat before it goes bad and... I was thinking we could have a party. A feast. What for? To celebrate our new chief officer. Don't drink the blue. Don't drink it. Why not? Zac says we shouldn't. It's medication to control us. - Richard. - Yeah. Kai! What are you doing? Get out of here now. Everyone go! Get out. Just remember, Richard isn't here to protect you. I don't need him to protect me. Is she all right? She doesn't want me to touch her. Sela? You in there? Looking for Sela? She's in the Med Bay. I just saw her. Hi. Everything all right? Yeah. Sela? Stop. What are you doing? What does it look like? Looks like you got here fast. Get out. Wait. - Whoa. - You're just like him. No, you don't understand. He was coming in here to get you. I was trying to help you. Why don't you help the rest of the crew? It's getting out of control. You're the leader. You should do something about it. Why'd you do that? What? You knew I was going to find Sela, and you went right to her. You need to leave her alone. You think 'cause you're chief officer, - you can tell me what to do? - No. - Good. - I'm telling you as a friend. Stay away from her. I'll do what I want. Kai! What are you doing, Kai? What's up? No, I'm good. Tayo... Tayo, get down from there. Don't sit on the table. That's right. You're not supposed put your feet where you're eating. Shut your face. All right. That's enough. - Kai. - What? No, no, no! Stop! Stop! Let go! - Let go! - Let it go. - Let it go! - Come on! - Let go! - Stop! Let's get them treated. And then I want everyone in the common room. There's no more fighting. It has to stop. It's not how we resolve our conflicts. Do you understand? Also, some of us aren't doing our work. No one's maintaining the ship. Why should we if no one else does? Because if you don't, who will? It isn't fair. We have to repair the damage and safeguard the ship. I want everyone finishing those two jobs. The ship is secure. We've done our job. Then everyone should be in the systems room. No. Now we're working on the food supply. This is more important. More important than food? No, you're wrong about that. You haven't been working on the food anyway. You haven't been doing anything. No one has. And if we don't, the mission won't survive. Who cares? We won't make it anyway. But somebody will. And it's our job to support them. To lay the groundwork. For our grandchildren. Who cares about them? We'll be dead. Listen, we're going to get that whole section up and running, and everyone's going to work on it. I don't want to work in the systems room. - Why not? - I just don't. He thinks the alien is living in there. What? That doesn't make any sense. It's on the outside. He says we brought it inside with Richard. Christopher brought it in. Now it's hiding in the damaged area. That's not true. I, for one, don't know if there is an alien. Who cares what you don't know? If we repair the damage, we can watch the surveillance video and see... Shut your fat, pus-filled face. I've got a right to talk. You talk too much as it is, you bloated, wheezing blister. Zac, she can talk. You shut up, too. Who are you? Telling people what to do. I'm chief officer. Why should that make any difference? Because I was chosen. It's in the program. It's in the rules. Who cares about the rules? Zac! Come on. We're strong, we can do what we want. Stop it! Both of you. Stop! I'm not listening to Christopher anymore. He's chief officer. You're not a commander. - You're not a leader. - I'm trying to keep us on track. Anyone who wants to follow me can. - I'll make more food. - That's our food, too. And I'll protect you from the alien. Especially if he's inside the ship now. You're just trying to scare them. Are you calling me a liar? Zac, why are you doing this? We need a new leader. He doesn't know how to feed you. He can't protect you. And I'm not going to listen to him anymore. Anyone who wants to be a part of my group is welcome. We'll have more food, so we're strong... Strong enough to fight the alien, strong enough to kill it. Anyone who wants can come with me. What if Zac is right about the alien? If we can just get that surveillance drive, then we can see what really happened. You don't think it's living in there, do you? I don't know. What are you doing? Nothing. Where's Christopher? I... I don't know. Who's in the systems room? No one. You all stay here. Don't let anyone come in. What do you think? What's through there? What is that? - Get behind it. - Try to close the door. Go! Go! Go! Close it! Close it! What was that? What happened? What was it? The surveillance drive. - There was really something in there? - What was it? - I don't know. - Not Christopher? - No. - What did it look like? It was dark. We couldn't see. Okay... Start shutting down the transmitter circuits now. It's pretty damaged. You can't see anything. - Copy that. - Let's try a different angle. I can clean this up. It's not as bad as it looks. Everything all right? No. What is it? Zac and Kai were in the systems room right after you left. They said they saw the alien. - They fought it. - What? It wasn't there when I was inside. And the room looks destroyed. There are pieces of the surveillance unit everywhere. The alien did that? Or they did it themselves. It doesn't matter. We have all the data right here. But if it was Zac and Kai, they did it for a reason. To destroy the record. Who's with him? Christopher. It was supposed to be me. Richard looked for you. All right, go into LCT 2. Copy that. Shutting down LCT 2. You should give him a little zap for his trouble. For my trouble... A little spark. - A sting? - A stab. You could do it. - I know I could. - He'd be surprised. He'd be shocked. You hear that? Yeah, it's just the ship. He knew it was the ship all along. This one? Yes. He didn't feel it. Nothing. Is he touching the cable? Yes. But his gloves are insulated. Murder... Don't mention this to anyone. Not until we decide what to do. How could Zac do that? Why have they all gone crazy? Maybe they haven't. Maybe this is what they're really like. We have our rules that keep us in line, but deep down, maybe this is our true nature. No. It can't be. I'm not like that. You're not like that. You're not. And the crew will be on our side once they know the truth. I'm not so sure. They don't care anymore. Sometimes, I don't either. You care. I know you do. I should leave you alone. No. I want you to stay. Time to wake up, Sela. Go away! Oh, we're not going away. We're coming in. What are you doing? What are you doing? I see I'm breaking up a nice little thing here. What do you want? We're having a celebration. Right now? Yes. Sela's invited. I guess you are, too. Come eat. If you want. Don't if you don't. - You okay? - Mmm-hmm. Get some food. You must be hungry. All right, listen up, everybody. Now I know we've had some disagreements in the past. We're going to put all that behind us. I'm chief officer now, and that's the way it's gonna be. From now on, we'll do the work, but we'll do it when we want and how we want. We'll make the rules, and anyone who breaks them will have to answer to me. The alien's somewhere in the ship. We'll fight it again if we have to, and we'll defeat it. You'll be safe now 'cause I'll protect you. Hey, what are you doing? Sit down. Richard was killed at 13:58:37. - Copy that. - He was electrocuted. Shutting down LCT 1. Who's with him? Christopher. It was supposed to be me. You should give him a little zap for his trouble. A little spark. - A sting? - A stab. - This one? - Yes. He didn't feel it. Is he touching the cable? Yes, but his gloves are insulated. Zac killed Richard. There is no alien. Not out there, not in here. There's only Zac. He's been lying to you the whole time. But now you know the truth. You've seen it with your own eyes. Zac should go to his compartment while we consult the program. Then we'll decide what to do. It's true. I did it. I killed him. But I did it for you. I did it to protect you. I did it because I saw the alien in him. The alien was in Richard, and then Christopher brought it inside. That's not true. He shouldn't have. He knew something was wrong, but he did it anyway. He brought the alien into the ship. Just watch the rest of the video. You'll see he's lying. I killed Richard to protect the crew, but now the alien's inside the ship somewhere. We need to find out where so we can stop it. So we can kill it. That's right. We'll kill it. We'll take back control. We've been drugged and betrayed and programmed by liars, but we're not going to follow the program anymore. We can't escape this life, but we won't just lay down and give up. We won't be afraid. We won't be terrorized. We'll fight back, we'll find it! There's nothing to find. Where is it now? First, it was inside Richard. Now maybe it's hiding in someone else. One of you. It could be you. Or you. Or you. We'll kill it. Yes. We'll find it and kill it. - Kill it. - We have to find it. - It could be you. - Or you. Or you. Or him. It's him. - It's him! - Him... It's him! It's him. Him. Get him! Stop! Stop it! It's okay. He had the alien inside of him. - I don't know. - He did. Don't worry. Unless it's you who has it inside. No. It's not me. Grab anything that can be used as a weapon. Scalpels, scissors, anything sharp. We have to arm ourselves to fight. We need something that will make him back down. Maybe we should just give up. We can't give up. But there's nothing we can do right now. We accused him of murder. He's not going to forget that. We should join his group. I mean, that's all he really wants anyway. Maybe later we can detain him. That's right. When things calm down. Eventually, things will calm down and be okay. Right now, it is too dangerous. We can't stay separate. There's no way to fight him. We don't have any weapons. Weapons. You know where they are. I do? He said you did. - Who did? - Richard. I was watching his video diary, and he said you knew about the weapons. Chief. Wake up. Was it the alien? It was Christopher. Must be for the third generation. When they reach the planet. No, these are for us. Chief. They want to join us. Why should we let you? What else can we do? Is the alien inside you? There isn't an... No. It's not. Where're they hiding? There they are. What are they holding? Weapons. And we just have this. That's not going to help us. Maybe it will. We can say we want to join his group. Like Anda and Alex. He'll never believe it. All we need is a moment. Why? So we can get close. And then what? And then I'll kill him. Kill him? Or he's going to kill us. - No, he's not. - They're moving. They cut the power. - What do we do? - We stay in here. No. We should go out there, talk to them. Tell them we don't want to fight. And then... They're here. Don't do anything. Don't resist. Grab him. Get off me! This way. Wait! Wait a minute! Get back, Sela! Zac. You can't stop us. Let me talk to you. What for? Privately. You can say whatever you want to say right here. I want to be with you. You want to join my group, or you want to be with me? Both. I bet you do. I do. I'm glad you've finally come to your senses. I have. I'll do anything you want. I'm sure you will. Only problem... ...is I don't want you to. You want to be with me, but I don't want to be with you. Maybe someone else does. But not me. Have you all gone crazy? Have you? Don't you see? All of this is against our nature. This is not who we are. This is who we are. But we don't have to act this way. We can think. We can decide to be different. Shut up, you genetic defect. We can decide which is better. - Shut up. - Shut up. Let me speak! We're trying to make sense here, and you're not listening. Shut up. - Shut up. - Shut up. Shut up. Shut up. Which is better? To have rules and agree, or... Or to run wild and fight? To run wild. Do you want to listen to reason and figure out a plan, or do you want to... You see? You see what I can do? Which way? You go that way. I'll check down here. This way. Check in the vats. Check in the refrigerators. Tayo. Check in there. No way they could fit. Check all of them. This one's been opened. Move back, Tayo. - What? - Get out of the way. Zac, that's for our food. Go see if we got them. We should stay... Check the drawers, try to find something. Next to you, in the cabinet. They're in the Med Bay. Hey! You're okay. You're okay. Get into a space suit. If we go out, we'll never get back in. Close hatch. Close hatch. Close hatch. Emergency oxygen released. Enter closing code. Hatch closing. Oxygen level 70%. Oxygen level 50%. - Oxygen level 30%. - No! Pressurize now. Pressurize now. Hatch stopped. Tayo. Put your guns down. Zac's gone. How do we make sure it doesn't happen again? So tomorrow we go. And as we begin our journey, I think about the world we are leaving behind. And how I've seen it at its best and its worst and how we'll have our own bad times. I mean, they're coming. There is nothing I can do about it. But I also know that you will prevail. And our best will live on. That we are worth saving. And the new Chief is... Sela. We are voting on everything now. Trying to reach consensus. It's not easy, but it's how we want to move forward. And we've decided to not go back on the blue. We feel that it is the best course of action. That we can do better. Hey, Chief, we just started those updates. Still been having headaches? She just kicked.
