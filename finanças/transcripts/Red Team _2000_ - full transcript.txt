(ominous music) - No, I'll be right there. (somber music) (beeping) - [Security Voice] Alarm armed. (ominous music) (police commotion) - Jesus. - So what do you think? - I'd say she's dead. - Brilliant deduction, rookie. - It's your turn. - Uh uh, I did it last time. - I did it the last time. Remember the worms? - I remember the worms. - No tongue. - It's our boy. My gift. - Thanks. (ominous music) - Wait, hold it, hold it. Freeze. Freeze. - What is it? - I don't know. Can you give me a bag? Be more careful, huh? Cops. Probably thought it was shit. - It probably is. (ominous music) (ominous beat music) (office commotion) Hi. - We're busted. - Okay. (man laughing) - Seriously! I'm interviewing this guy, right? He's very upset about his mother's disappearance. He's going on and on about hos much he misses her. The whole time he's playing darts. I mean, he's pounding these darts into the board like a son-of-a-bitch. So I ask him, I says, "Hey, can I see a picture of your mother?" He goes off to get me one. So I snag one of the darts, just a hunch, right? I give it to forensics. They find nine new traces of blood on the handle. We arrest the guy. He breaks down. Turns out, he's been using his mother's severed head as target practice though, huh? How about that? Hey, glad you could make it. Hope we didn't interrupt your busy schedule. Reed, run the Serial Killer Apprehension Program. (typing) (beeping) - [Reed] Ready. - Go. - Currently we've got 38 cases working. (beeping) Boise, Idaho 1988, Irving, Texas 1992. These two plus three more. Tim Cartwright is the perp. He got sentenced to death yesterday at 3:15. - [Captain] Anything else? - Isn't there always? Port Everglades Strangler. (beeping) He's been pinpointed and they're moving in right about now. (computer beeping) And the Silencer hit again this morning. - The Silencer? - [Reed] Hey, all the good names were taken. - You find anything? - We may have found something, sir. - We'll let you know. - Yeah, you do that. All right guys, let's get out there and save some lives. Red Team, my office. Now. (somber music) - Bought you time, kid. - I want some action, Steph. I'm sick of IDing dead bodies and doing research all the time. I always get the paperwork. - Copy that. I'll check it out. (police siren alarming) (ominous music) (police siren bleeping) - Hey. (somber music) How did you know to call us? - I remember this old APB on an albino-eyed guy, so we took a quick set of prints and, boom, you came up. - Thanks. (ominous music) - [Chandler] Look at his eye. - That's our guy. Guess we can close some cases today. - Yeah, I guess so. I'm gonna take a look around. - Come on. Tik tok, tik tok. Look, I don't plan on being stuck in Hicksville any longer than I have to. - What's the rush, city girl? - City girl has a hot date and she plans on keeping it. - I got a job to do. Give me a few minutes. (police commotion) - Gee, thanks. (ominous music) (foreboding music) Jason! Come on! Let's go! - This is no accident. - A piece of thread does not equal a murder. - Steph, he was tied to the steering wheel, okay? The thread wasn't normal. Somebody sent him off the bridge. - Yeah, well that piece of crap killed eight women. If someone did kill him, then we should give them a freaking medal. - He was murdered. - Believe it or not, there's a whole world of people out there who don't kill other people. Where people hand candlelit dinners. Maybe a little sex. They have fun. (laughing) (ominous beat music) Can you finish that report on your own? - You got some primping to do? - As a matter of fact, yes. - All right. - Thank you. (knocking) - Be careful, huh? - Jason, my dates always go off well. If they try anything I don't like, the cuffs come out. - And if they try something that you do like? - The cuffs still come out. (Steph chuckling) - Dinner, sex, fun. No, I think I'll take door number two. (beeping) Serial killers. (somber music) (computer beeping) (ominous music) (computer beeping) That's odd. (computer beeping) (keyboard clicking) Unknown? (beeping) I-15 Killer. No kills for the last two cycles. Why? (ominous music) (beeping) Half Moon Killer. But none for the last 8 months. Why? (beeping) Eight missing serial killers in the last 18 months. That's impossible. (dog barking) Two died of accidents and six seem to have just stopped killing. - Stop? They don't just stop. It's not in their pathology. Why would they? (computer beeping) - In class, all this stuff seemed so distant. What makes a serial killer? The execution? The method? - The choice. - The choice. - They choose. They see something. Panty lines, blonde hair, whatever. They see it and they want to control it. To own it. Then they recreate their fantasy. Usually getting more and more violent. Then they take trophies of their kills. But you know this as well as I do, Jason. The FBI and I didn't recruit you for your debonair sense of style. (chuckling) What's up? - It's just that one of the accidents was a little suspect and I would like to take a look at another one. Motel room suicide. - I need all the info. Pictures, reports, the whole deal. Always the prepared student. - Always looking to impress the best professor. - And? - And the greatest field agent of all time. Until I came along, of course. - Wise ass. Hey, am I getting paid for this? - The usual. - All right. (computer beeping) - You ever get sick of these guys? - I did. Day one at the academy years ago. (chuckling) But somebody needs to catch them and obviously now I can't. But with the help of this old Betty, I can learn everything about them and you can catch them. (computer beeping) There you go. (ominous music) That's ones off, right? Suicide? - Yeah. So? - Well, remember what I taught you. Don't look at everything as a whole. Step back and see the individual pieces. - Zoom into the gun. (ominous music) - 45. - One of the most powerful handguns made. - Your point? - The recoil from that gun would've sent his arm back. There's no way he could still have it in his hand. Somebody killed this guy, Randal, and the Wild Dog Man. There may be six others. (foreboding music) (phone ringing) Hey. How was your date? - Handcuffs got a workout, but I'm all right. Forensics came in. - And? - Stuff under her fingernails, dried plant matter. The Lady's slipper orchid, to be precise. Here it is. Doesn't grow anywhere near by. There's only one placer in town that sells it. - Let's go buy some flowers. - There you go. (ominous beat music) Here. Dead girl from the monastery. - She was pretty. - "Was" being the operative word. - Remember that guy yesterday? - Yes, Jason. Actually, yesterday is still pretty clear to me. - What if he was murdered? What if there was someone out there killing serial killers? Serial serial killer. - No. - Just like that? "No?" - Well first of all, he wouldn't be a "serial serial killer." Because that's redundant. He would be a "serial killer killer." - Okay, whatever. I'm asking you a serious question here. - Well, I would say more power to him, okay? Or her. - Steph, I'm not joking. - You actually believe this don't you? I mean, you actually do. - Yes. - Okay. You convince Heywood and you convince me. Now, is there anything else? Then fine. Then it's your turn. I don't understand why I get the ones with no tongues and you get to buy flowers. It's not fair. (somber music) (water spraying) - May I help you? - Yeah, I need some flowers. - Any particular occasion? - It's an apology. - An apology. Those seem to be some of our best sellers. Trust me? - Sure. (somber music) You Mr. Keller? - The one and only. Here. These have "I'm sorry" written all over them. - Thank you very much. - You're welcome. - Here you go. I'll see you next time. - Are we overcome by emotion? - I'm a sensitive guy. I get to keep them clean. - Find something? - Probably not, but I'm gonna have to check for prints anyways. (ominous beat music) - You want me to believe that there's someone out there killing serial killers. - Yes sir. A serial killer killer. It's a classic organized personality. He chooses his victims based on certain criteria and then he hunts them down. - Well how does he find them? - That I don't know. But what I do know is that we have two dubius accidents and six very unlikely disappearances. - Disappearances? - We have six serial killers who've stopped killing. Their MOs haven't shown up anywhere. - Proof? - I found this in a cut on Wild Eye's wrist. What that is is a dissolvable surgical suture that didn't dissolve. What I think happened was that he was murdered, tied to the steering wheel and then sent over the ledge. Whoever did it wanted it to appear like it was an accident. Also in the motel room suicide case, the deceased was found with a 45 caliber still in his hand. - So? - Well the force from that shot woulda knocked that gun halfway across the room. - Agent Chandler, tell me exactly what is it you want me to do. - I want you to respect my hunch and let me run with this. (laughing) - God damn. I don't know whether to slap you on your back or upside the head. - Sir? - This is good. Crazy but good. - Thank you, sir. - I'll tell you what, you and Dobson come over to Red Team on a trial basis. Work with the big boys. (chuckling) - We'd like that very much, sir. - And lose the sir shit. The name is Heywood, use it. Upload everything you've got on this serial killer killer. I'll review it and let you know how to proceed. - Thank you. Heywood. - Now get out of here, I've got work to do. (door closing) Serial killer killer. God damn. (computer beeping) - Killer, huh? Figures. - What? - [Jason] Our pal, the florist. - [Steph] Yeah? - Prints didn't match his name. His real name is J.B. Gaines. - And? - And he used to work for a home alarm company. Did two years for breaking and entering into the houses that he wired. - Really? - And that's not all. (ominous music) - Chandler. Dobson. Let's go. - We're getting called up from the minors for the night. - You serious? - I'm serious. - Time to play with the big boys. - That's right. (intense music) - Okay, this is what we got. Freddy Whiteside. Six killings. Four states. Four stabbings. Two victims battered to death. My sources tell me that he's at his girlfriend's house. - Oh god, his girlfriend. Hope they have a good time together. - Questions? (intense music) Let's go! Let's go! Hustle! (ominous music) (plane zooming) (intense music) - I don't think so, lady. (laughing) - Drop the gun, Freddy! Just relax. (Freddy laughing) Easy, buddy. Drop the gun. Drop the gun! Don't make it worse for you. (intense music) Heywood! (Freddy laughing) He's moving! (engine rumbling) (booming) (crashing) - Garcia, check it out. - Steph! You all right? You all right? - He definitely dead. (ominous music) - You did the right thing. I'm wanna show you something. Patty. You see her? Her face? Freddy Whiteside loved this woman. (eerie music) Just think how he treated the others. Jason, we do what has to be done. I want you on Red Team on a permanent basis. We can use a man like you. Just you. - Would be an honor, sir. - Welcome aboard, son. Welcome aboard. (sniffling) (doorbell ringing) - Just a minute. Who is it? - Jason. You feel better? - No, I feel stupid. I can't believe I let that guy get over on me. - We all make mistakes. - I don't. - I talked to Heywood. - And? - He wants me to join the Red Team. - Jason, that's fantastic. Oh. You. He wants you to join. Well, I don't know what I expected. I mean, I fucked up today. - Oh come on, Steph. - Shut up. I don't have enough room in this apartment for you and your sympathy. It's okay. - What do we do now? - We? (chuckling) I think as of right now, we're not partners anymore, are we? - I guess not. (sighing) - Well, the least you can do is ask a girl for dinner. - Would you like to go out to dinner? - When? - Tomorrow night. - I think I might be free.

Why not the office? - Not everyone is so adept at breaking in to encrypted government files. - Voilà. It's all yours. (beeping) Nice guy. - Let's see. History of abuse. Attacked a priest at 13. Went to juvy at Saint Elizabeth's. Can we get into the Saint Elizabeth records? - Let's see. (ominous music) (computer beeping) Oh, no. Lost in a fire in 1980. Never put on disk. - Oh shit. - Who is this guy? - You ever hear of the Silencer? So he was here at Saint Elizabeth's? - Oh yes, Mr. Gaines was here. He spent four years in our company. - And? - And what? He was borderline. They only put him here after his mother admitted that she couldn't take care of him. And that altercation with the priest. - And what kind of disposition did he have? Was he timid? Was he outgoing? - No, he kept to himself. He had a place for everything and everything in its place. Obsessive-compulsive. - Obsessive-compulsive, huh? - Yeah. - Did the other kids accept him? - They terrorized him. It was horrible. And then there were the cats. - Cats? - He was obsessed with these cats that ran wild on the property. One day they all just disappeared. We kept finding them for years after that. Dead and wrapped in flowers. (pleasant piano music) (chuckling) - Thank you. Nice wine. - I haven't been in law enforcement my whole life. - No? - No, I actually... My family used to be caretakers on a vineyard in Napa. - Wine people. - Poor people. (laughing) - So when did you decided to break the cycle? Go for the government paycheck? - I studied criminology in college. That's where I met Randal. And then I got into the bureau off his recommendation and that was that. - Shall we go? - No desert? Are you sure you wanna do this? - Yeah. I'm sure I wanna do this. (somber music) (moaning) (phone ringing) - Fuck. - Not tonight. - Is that yours or mine? (phone ringing) - Yours. (phone ringing) - God. Chandler here. (ominous music) Yeah, Heywood. I got it. I'll be right there. I gotta-- - Bye. Tell you one thing, this girl's going to bed. - You're torturing me, you know that. (keys jingling) - If you get back before dawn, let yourself in. (somber music) (intense music) - Okay guys, listen up. This is what we got. Walter Ringler, 37. Pedophile. Lead to 13 disappearances in 3 states. 18 hours ago, a 10 year old drops out of sight within 2 miles of Ringler's house. - The locals talk to Ringler? - Sure. But he played dumb. They've got no ground for support. - So what's our jurisdiction? How can we just-- - You on the team? - Yes, sir. - You got questions? - No, sir. (ominous music) (fire crackling) (sizzling) (intense music) (thudding) - Going somewhere? (thudding) (groaning) - Where's the kid? The kid? (groaning) (thudding) Let's get him. Agent Chandler. Get the kid, put him in the van. (intense music) - Are you okay? (intense music) (Ringler whimpering) (Ringler yelling) (lock beeping) All right. You'll be safe in here. Be right back here to get you, okay? (intense music) (Ringler yelling) (suspenseful music) - Come on! Come here! How does it feel, huh? - Heywood! Heywood! (ominous music) (groaning) - Leave the watch. (yelling) (thudding) (ominous music) - What happened? - He tried to get away. Stupid bastard. We tried to cuff him but he fell off the bridge. Have you ever captured a serial killer? Huh? - No. - Exactly. Let's get that little boy and take him home. (ominous music) (lock clicking) (dramatic music) - You were gone a long time. Everything okay? - It was strange. - Did you get your guy? - Yeah. It was weird. He's dead. - You stopped a serial killer from killing again. - Yeah, but Steph. - But nothing, okay? You saved innocent lives. Come here. (dramatic music) (ominous music) (office commotion) - Sit down. Cigar? Cubanos. Can't beat them. - They're illegal. - Technically. - Technically? - So, how are you? - I'm fine. - I was looking for you earlier. - I've been real busy. - I thought you'd like to know that that little boy has been reunited with his parents. - That's great. - That guy almost got Reed. - Yeah. - Yeah. Luckily, we stopped him. - Luckily. - Red Team, we look out for each other. (ominous music) So, what're you working on? - Gaines. - The Silencer. What do you got? - He seems to fit the profile that behavioral sciences cooked up. - Childhood abuse, mutilation of animals. I've seen your report, but you've got nothing on him. - I don't have a goddamn thing on him. - What's his pattern? - Kill every three months. The last one was his fourth. - You think he's ripe for a visit? - I don't know-- - You don't trust your hunch? - I think that I would like to start with a tail before I jump to any conclusions. - Done. You're excused, Agent Chandler. (ominous music) - Remember my mark? My serial killer killer? I found him. - Who? - Heywood. - Bullshit. - Randal, last night I saw Red Team throw a man off a bridge. - Self defense. - No way. He was totally defenseless. - Look, I worked with Heywood for 22 years. If it wasn't for him, forget this wheelchair. I'd be dead. - We both know that those accidents were not accidents. Since then, two more missing serial killers have turned up dead, both of them were on Heywood's beat. Four more missing serial killers who've just decided to stop killing. Now you're the one who always taught me, serial killers do not just decide to stop killing. It's not in their pathology. And today, Heywood asked me if I wanted to pay a little visit to J.B. Gaines. - But? - No, but nothing. He's using me to get to Gaines. Red Team is not justice, Randal. These guys are nothing more than an execution squad. - This is unbelievable. Jason, you've gotta be careful. - I know. Somehow I've got to get to Director Wexler. - Not yet. We need hard evidence or Heywood would crush us. I'll hack into their system and get it. Meanwhile, you've gotta play along. Pretend you're still with them. Because if they find out you're not, you're dead. (foreboding music) (door closing) (ominous music) - [Gaines Voiceover] Dear Jason, I do hope you like the flowers. They're lovely, aren't they? The way they open up to the light and just breathe like women. They can be had, you know? They can all be had. See you soon. Love, your special friend. (ominous music) (beeping) - [Security Voice] 12 hours, 14 minutes of activation. No intruders. (thudding) (intense music) - Maybe I shoulda called first. - I didn't know it was you. - Chinese? - I'm not really in the mood right now. - Come on, it's only 1:15 in the morning. (ominous music) - I just got a nice little present from our friend, Gaines. - Lady's slipper orchids from your favorite florist. (chuckling) Sweet guy. Jason, what's going on? Are you trying to tell me that the head of the serial killer apprehension team and his elite agents are personally responsible for at least nine murders of suspected serial killers? I don't know what to say. That's crazy. It can't be true. - No, I know it's crazy. But it's true. - Does anyone else know this? - Randal's helping me gather the evidence. - And he believes this? - Yes. - I still don't believe it. - Last night, Heywood, Reed, Warshofsky and Garcia had this guy on top of this bridge. Four elite FBI agents, right? Could've easily apprehended them but you know what they decided to do instead? - What? - Throw him off. - What? - They murdered him, Stephanie. The FBI murdered him. We murdered him. - Can you prove it? - Yeah. (ominous music) (office commotion) ("Happy Pill" by 16 Volt) - [Gaines Voiceover] I told you we'd meet again soon.

I shot back. I thought it was Gaines. - But it wasn't? - It was a setup. They guy was bound and gagged. - What're you gonna do? - I'm gonna keep gathering evidence on Red Team and try and turn them in. There's nothing else I can do. (computer beeping) - No trace of Gaines. No credit card receipts, ATM withdraws, nothing electronic traceable in the last 72 hours. - Can you get me into Red Team's computer? - You locked out? (computer beeping) - Not a problem. (keyboard clicking) Let's see what I can do. (computer clicking) (ominous music) Here we are. I'm in. (computer beeping) - [Jason] File erased? - They're on to you. (beeping) - [Jason] What's that? - They're tracing me. (beeping) - Get out, Randal. - I'm trying. (beeping) I don't know if I can get out in time. - Randal, they can't find me here. (ominous music) - Come on, Randal, hurry. (beeping) - I'm trying. Almost. - Come on. - Almost, almost. (alarm beeping) - [Stephanie] Randal. - [Jason] Randal! - I'm trying! Almost. (intense music) Got it! (beeping) And we're out. - They trace you? - No way. I hope. (ominous music) - Stephanie, I'm going after Red Team. You gonna back me up? - Yeah. I'll back you up. - Thanks, partner. - All right, we start at the top. You bring Director Wexler some preliminary evidence and you keep in abreast. - Makes sense to me. - You can have that arranged? - Absolutely. (plane whooshing) (ominous music) - I'm nervous. - Relax. - Sector 4. Perimeter secure. - Agent Dobson. - Sir. This is Agent Chandler. - Agent Chandler. Dobson briefed me. Good work. You have my full support. - Thank you, sir. - You and Dobson stay under cover. Keep me apprised. Until we see how deep this goes, it's imperative that you say nothing to anyone. - Yes, sir. - Understood? - Yes, sir. - Evidence? Thank you. Randal Brookes is helping you? - Yes, sir. - Good. I'll be in touch. (intense music) (groaning) (whimpering) (thudding) (groaning) (ominous music) (thudding) - [Security Voice] Warning! Warning! (gun clicking) - Good evening, Jason. - [Security Voice] Warning! Warning! - Come here. Come here. That's a good boy. - [Security Voice] Warning! - Turn off the alarm. Come on. - [Security Voice] Warning! Warning! Alarm disarmed. - Isn't this fun? - Hey, Jason. You're home early. - We've been waiting. - Why? - Big why or little why? - Big why. - Because we do what needs to be done. The men we kill don't deserve to live. Everyone one of them dead is innocent lives saved. - Not to mention millions of tax dollars. - No, I mean why me? - Well you were gonna talk, Jason. We can't have that. (foreboding music) Let's go. (glass shattering) (intense music) (groaning) (door clicking) (ominous music) - What're you doing here? - Gave me your keys, remember? - What happened? - Well, I went home only to find Warshofsky and Garcia waiting in my place. - What? - Red Team is trying to kill me, Steph. - All right. What can I do to help you? - You gotta call Wexler. Now! - Give me the phone. (phone dialing) (dial tone buzzing) (ominous music) - Well? - Done deal. He's on his way. - Thanks. - Come here. What do you think you're doing until then? - Um, probably trying not to get killed. - Yeah? - What're you doing? (somber music) (moaning) - Hey! (gun clicking) Hope I didn't interrupt anything. - Stop. (gun clicking) - Sorry to spoil the party. - Took you long enough. (menacing music) Jason, I've been trying to tell you, these are the guys with the white hats. You joined the wrong team. - Stephanie's been with the Red Team for quite some years. Although her work with us has been a little more circumspect. Now get up. We've got a date with a friend of yours. (ominous music) - Can't hold your liquor? (thudding) - Jason. I want to thank you for leading me to another serial killer. You two know each other. - Now what? - Let's see. You've been following Mr. Gaines for quite some time and then you've cornered him, started fighting and killing each other. Then this place goes up in flames. One dead serial killer and one dead serial killer killer. - That's a nice plan. - Don't. I'm sorry it had to be this way but you made the wrong choice. I tried to stop you. I tried to show you the right way. - No regrets? - No. No regrets. - You won't be needing this. (ominous music) Sorry I can't do this myself. (booming) (electrical popping) (fire crackling) (suspenseful music) (groaning) (thudding) - It seems that your friends have ensured our demise. I've always been a true believer in fate, Mr. Chandler. - I've always liked to choose my own. Don't try anything. (suspenseful music) (knocking) Fate. Move. Get in there. (suspenseful music) (coughing) - I'd love to find your boss and get my watch back. - Son of a bitch takes trophies. Go! Get down that hole! (groaning) Come on. (intense music) (explosion booming) No (dramatic music) (sobbing) I'm sorry. (foreboding music) - Hello. You're rather attractive, aren't you? Your complexion is lovely. - You're supposed to be dead. - I've been dead since I was 13. - Heywood's gonna be here any minute. - You know what I can do to you in a minute? Step into the light. Lift your head up. Lift your head up! Now swallow. I'd put ice on your throat so you didn't feel the blade. - What can I-- (shushing) - Don't talk. (ominous music) - How's it going, Steph? - Jason? - Don't worry, he's cuffed to the chair. I saw Randal. Murder anyone else lately? How do you like my new partner? (gun clicking) You see, things aren't always what they seem, you know? - You think you're rooting something? Huh? You think you're striking a big blow for justice in America? - Actually, yeah. Yeah, I do. - For who? Huh, Jason? For who? For some lawyer who plea bargains a murder to a misdemeanor. Or what about the rapist who gets out because the cop's warrant expired at midnight. Or the tax payers who provide three meals a day and cable for killers. Huh? You tell me, Jason, for who? - I do it because it's the law. Or do you even remember what that is? Innocent until proven guilty. Does that ring a bell to you at all? What about the one time that you're wrong, Steph? What about the one time you kill that innocent man whose life would've been saved by a trial? By justice. - Red Team's gonna eat you alive and chew on your bones. Don't you get it? They're-- - Serial killers. Yeah. They torture people. They kill them and they enjoy it. Now I wonder what that's like to be the judge, the jury and the executioner. You know what you're gonna do? You're gonna get on the phone and you're gonna call Heywood. You're gonna tell him I have you and you're gonna have him meet me at my house. You understand? Do it. Call now. (dial tone buzzing) (phone beeping) (suspenseful music) Home sweet home. Get out! - What about me? - What about you? We're expecting company. - So? You're uncuffing me? Why? - The enemy of my enemy is my friend. - Why should I help you? - Because they're coming for the both of us. When we get done, I got a nice little blonde present waiting for you. Move. Move! (suspenseful music) (intense music) (thudding) Still walk and point? Don't suppose you wanna tell me where the other ones are. - Fuck you! (thudding) - Didn't think so. (intense music) (gun clicking) - Drop it. I got him. South center house! Not today, Chandler. - Where is she? - She's inside. (intense music) (gunshot booming) (yelling) - You having a party without me?! - You better not have killed them. - Lying low like you told me. Besides, I don't care much for me. - Yeah, I know. - Maybe I've make an exception! (gunshot booming) (glass shattering) (suspenseful music) - Maybe not. Is he gonna die? - Maybe. - Enough to kill your friend in there. - You'd kill him anyways. - That's right, but now I'm really gonna take my time. - This could all end, Heywood. You can turn yourself in. - For what? For doing my job? You see what these people do. There isn't anyone on this planet that's gonna put me away. Not one! And no one's ever gonna know. (gunshot booming) (yelling) (intense music) - It's over, Heywood! (groaning) (yelling) - Let's let the boys play. You and I need a little quiet time. (intense music) (groaning) (thudding) - It's not over until it's over! (groaning) You know, I thought I knew you Jason. I thought you had the heart of a hunter. But no, you're just a bureau-fucking-crat! A desk jockey and now I'm gonna have to fucking kill you! (suspenseful music) (yelling) (thudding) (ominous music) - I'm sorry this is going to be so quick. I'm usually much more considerate. (groaning) - Gaines? (suspenseful music) (Stephanie yelling) (shushing) - It took so much. But I have a little remedy for that. Feel the cold steel against your skin. Open up. Open up! (Stephanie screaming) - Gaines! Gaines! Freeze! Drop the knife! - You said I could have her! You promised! - I lied. - Then it looks like it's gonna be two for one. Or none at all. (suspenseful music) (Stephanie screaming) (gunshot booming) (groaning) (ominous music) (Gaines laughing) Feels so good. You love it, don't you? I can see it in your eyes. Do it. Pull the trigger. The power. Do you feel the power? To silence them all. Do it. You love it, don't you? Silence us all. Do it. Do it! Finish me! (groaning) - You're under arrest. (helicopter buzzing) (police sirens alarming) (dramatic music) - You're going down, Jason. You're going down hard. - No regrets, Stephanie. Remember? No regrets. (police sirens alarming) (dramatic music) (somber music) - Mr. Chandler. - Director Wexler. - I'm sorry you're leaving us. You were a good agent, Chandler. - Thank you, sir. - You did what had to be done. (ominous music) ("Refabrication" by Ryeland Allison)
