- Subtitles - Lu?s Filipe Bernardes There they go, Bob. The next generation of racing drivers. It'll be a few years here before they'll be competiton. Better hide your laurels, Bob. One of these kids is liable to grow up and steal them from you. If that kid don't watch out, he'll turn over. He won't turn over, that car's weighted. It's a lucky thing for him you built it for him. He's a great kid, I hope he wins. And if he breaks his neck, it's because he's trying to be a big shot like you. - Yeah. - Oh, that reminds me, I was talking to Maggie and she says you ought to be stepping out in your own hood. You ain't gonna get anywhere being a mechanic for Griffin. Attaboy! Come on, Johnny! Come on, let's go. These races are bad for my blood pressure. The kid drives like a veteran. Let's go give them the glad hand. - Well, I guess I out-classed you. - Go on, you were just lucky. - Yeah? And you're a sorehead. - Want to make something of it? Yeah, I think I will. - Why, you... - Hey, come on, hey! Come on, you kids, come on here, cut it out. Hey, wait a minute here, cut it out! He called me a sorehead, I ain't no sorehead. Nobody can call me a sorehead and get away with it. Alright, alright, alright. Fighting won't get you any place. Come on, Johnny, I want to talk to you. Come on. Aw, I'll pin his ears back. Don't you know you'll never get anywhere socking people? Yeah, but you got to admit that was a swell race I drove, huh? What started the fireworks? Seems that Johnny called somebody a sorehead. - How did you like the race, Miss Sanford? - You were great, Johnny. Yeah, won't be long before I'll be driving one of your father's cars. Well, go on, kid, get cleaned up and get back to the shop, we got a lot of work to do. Right. You know, you did a good job on that car, that motor had plenty of zip. - Thanks. - Should have been a good job, he's been putting all his spare time on it. You know, Storm, it might be a good idea if you put some of your spare time... ...on that car I'm supposed to drive. After all, that race is a little more important to all of us. Don't you worry about that car, it'll be ready by race time. Oh, I'm not worrying too much about it, if that car isn't the way I want, I can get another mechanic. Oh, will you two boys stop throwing mud pies at each other? After all, Bob, nobody else is complaining about what Wally does with his time. Oh, well, let's forget it. Come on, let's go, shall we? Well, if you're in such a frightful hurry, why don't you run along? I want to look at these midget cars. Do you mind? Do I mind? Come on! It's getting kind of cold, ain't it? After we have a look at the cars, supposing I was to get up enough nerve... ...to ask you if I could drive you back to the shop? What would you say? - Well, supposing you ask me. - I'm asking. Well, I'm going. Say, um... have you been playing any poker lately? I never play poker. Well, If I was you, I'd get in a good game, ...because I got a hunch you'd be lucky at cards. - Why? - Because I got another hunch... ...you're gonna be unlucky in love. You know, these midget races are good publicity. It gets people interested in racing. I wasn't watching the race. This coming race at Fairfield means a lot to you and your dad, doesn't it? A great deal. And I'm glad you're here to help us. I'm sure you and Bob can bring us home a winner. Your friend Bob and I don't gel very well. I know. Sometimes we don't gel very well either. Why, I thought that you and Bob were... Well, really good friends. Oh, no. We've known each other a long time. That's about all it amounts to. Well, I think I can light that torch again. Oh, the bulldog on the bank and the bullfrog in the pool. I wouldn't mention it, Mr. Sanford, ...unless I felt it was for the good of everybody concerned. Well, I've never had any trouble with Wally. I'm sorry haven't been getting along with him. He and I just don't talk the same language. I don't trust him. That's pretty thin excuse for firing him, Bob. Well, I think it's important as driver of the car I have a mechanic I can get along with. I mean, a man who really puts some time in. He seems to be more interested in these midget racing cars. What does it matter? After all, he's done a lot of work, and good work. And his outside interests haven't interfered with his work here. He's also done a lot of talking. Telling people he thinks he's a better driver than I am... ...and he ought to be in the driver's seat instead of me. That's kind of funny, he don't seem like that kind of person. Another thing, Mr. Sanford, he also has a slight inclination to hit the bottle. I don't think that's a very good habit in a mechanic. I don't want to go into a big race with a man who has to have a bottle of liquor... ...to bolster his nerve. You're right about that, Bob. Let's go see Wally. All right, sir. I've worked on this thing all night, I sure hope it fits. Oh, it'll fit. - Ah, right on the nose! - Say, you know, you're getting good. You're telling me? Just a modest schoolboy, I know. Alright, tighten it down. - Oh, the bulldog on the bank... - And the bullfrog in the pool. - Pat! - Yes, Dad? - Hello, Bob. - Hello, Pat. Well, Dad, put a little rainbow around your shoulder. The car'll be finished tomorrow and we'll have nearly e week to try her out in. Good. I wish you'd go upstairs, Pat, and check some invoices that came in. Alright. There's no special rush about that, is there? Yes, there is, Pat. I wish you'd attend to it. - Okay, Dad. - Here, Willy. - Storm, I want to talk to you. - Okay. I understand, Wally, you've been doing a lot of talking. Telling everybody you're a better driver than Bob here. No, I haven't said anything like that. Maybe it just got around. I don't want a mechanic who thinks he's better than I am. Say, you two are taking a long time to tell me I'm fired. Now, Wally, I don't want any friction. Another thing, I don't like your familiar attitude toward Miss Sanford. She can take care of herself. If I get out of line, she'll tell me. Yeah, you are out of line and I'm telling you. - I haven't heard a word you've said. - Well, maybe you'll hear this. Paste that in your scrapbook! I'm sorry, Mr. Sanford. You're through, Storm, check out. I've got a habit of getting around to things. And I'm going to get around to you, Griffin. Some day, some place. Say, listen, you ain't gonna get any place socking people, you know that, don't you? - Yeah, you're right, kid. - Sure. I'm gonna quit too. I don't like working here anymore. No, you don't, you're gonna stay right here. Soon as I get set some place else, I'll take you with me. - What am I gonna do here? - Hey, do I hear you squawking? What a right hand that guy's got. Come in. Well, what happened to that grin I left you with? I'm checking out. What goes on, Wally? Well, to put it very clearly, I let Mr. Griffin have it, so I'm fired. - Did Dad fire you? - He's right. If the racing driver can't get along with his mechanic, then the mechanic better clear out. - What about the driver clearing out? - He's usually more valuable. Well, so long. And lots of luck. - Well, the motor looks all right. - But that don't mean nothing. A lot of all-right things about this car. It's a pretty sweet chariot. Where do I come in? I made a place here for you as my mechanic. I want to be sure I don't lose any races. I'm with you, Griffin. If we're gonna clean up at Dayton and we can't afford to lose any races. Don't worry, when this car loses a race, I won't be in it. If a guy passes you on the drag you stand a pretty good chance of losing. Nobody's gonna pass me. I built up a new angle, simple and effective. What is it? Wait a minute and I'll show it to you. Now look at this. Now, suppose a driver's coming up fast. And I catch his front wheel in-between my two wheels just like this, see? Locking wheels, hm? Liable to mean curtains for both of you. Yeah, but I got another idea. Come in. Gosh you look pretty. What was the trouble between you and Wally? Oh, Storm's all right, a good mechanician. As a matter of fact, I wouldn't want anyone better. If you'll forget about it, I'll tell you some good news. I don't want to forget about it. What was the trouble? Same thing that's always been the trouble with me. I'm in love with you, Pat, always have been. Is that the reason for Wally being discharged? Don't be angry with me for that. After all, you know, I got the sock in the jaw. - Let it go at that. - Suits me. - How about having dinner with me tonight? - I don't think so. Oh, I figured it as a sort of pre-celebration of our winning the race Thursday night. - Let's wait till we win it. - Oh, we'll win it, all right. Don't you worry, that silver helmet's just as good as mine right now. And you know you mustn't be angry with me because you've got to present it to the winner. Yes, I know. Uh, the lady would like to finish her make-up. I think the lady has a mad on. You're right, Bob, the lady has. The preliminary two-lap event which you've just witnessed has been won by Bob Griffin, the northwestern racing champion. And now, while the mechanics are busy in the pits tuning up the cars... ...for the main event of 75 laps, the Silver Helmet, the preliminary trophy, will be presented by Miss Patricia Sanford, daughter of that famous race-car designer Martin Sanford ...whose cars has twice won the Dayton 500-mile classic. Car driven by Bob Griffin, Mr. Sanford-designed and Sanford-built car... which raced tonight for the first time on any track. Miss Sanford is now presenting the Silver Helmet. And believe you me, it's no tin derby. I'd like to crown him myself. - Great race, Bob. Congratulations. - I told you I'd win this helmet. How about giving him that kiss, Miss Sanford? Give us a break, will you, Miss Sanford? Okay, why not? Watch close and you'll see the real prize for winning this preliminary event. Bob Griffin took that kiss big. What a pair. The northwestern driving champion and the prettiest girl north, east, south or west. They sure make a pretty couple. She's alright. But that guy Griffin is so crooked he couldn't hide behind a corkscrew. - Is that one of your cracks? - Yeah. You wanna make something of it? - Plenty. - Hey, wait a minute, Sir Gallahad. - You're heading for a gale. - Yeah? Where here she blows. You keep out of this, Bud! Which one of you guys wanna go with me? I don't, I don't... it's alright, officer. They know each other, just a friendly wrestling match, that's all. I'll take a fall out of you after the race. Okay, and bring Griffin along too. I owe him something. Why weren't you out here helping with this car? These palookas made a crack about you and I wouldn't stand for it. Listen, Griffin. You try any of your usual stuff on our driver tonight, I'll see that it's the last race you ever drive in. - Is that a promise? - It is. - Are you Wally Storm? - Why, yes, I am. - My name's Bud Keene. - How are you? - Fine, how are you? - What's up? My name's Hanson, I'm one of the judges here. Yes, I know who you are, Mr. Hanson. Mr. Neville put in a request for you, he wants you to drive his car tonight. H-He wants me? What's happened? His driver Hatfield, turned up sick and he doesn't want to take a chance. Now, he needs a driver, and he wants us to okay you. Well, holy smoke, why don't you give me the okay so that I can drive it? You're in, Storm, now hurry up and get ready. - Oh, gee, thanks, Mr. Hanson. - Good luck. Thanks again. Oh, boy, what a break, what a break! Let's go, pal. Maggie'll get a kick out of this. Pat, I'm gonna drive in the main event against your car. - Wally! - Well, that's good news. Don't you try to crowd me, Griffin. - Don't worry, you'll be too far behind. - Oh, yeah? Wally, if you've got a better car than ours, you'll win. Come on, Bud, let's wheel her out. Look out for that guy, Bob, he's a dirt-track driver. Okay, Curley. Don't forget, you and me got a date after this, sweetheart. Don't you forget it! The cars are now being shoved off to the start of the main event, going down on the south turn, coming around the back straight away, they're jockeying for position. Pretty quick on the mark-turn now, they're coming out on the front stretch, sweeping down the starting line and they're off! Bob held the pole at the turn. I told him to take the pole position on the first turn. That's where more than half the races are won. Nothing to it. He'll have him before he's gone half the distance. He's got the best car, that's something. - How do you like it, greasehog? - Cut that out, Curley. - Watch that second car, Bob! - Take number 1 on the first turn! Sort of goofy to yell yourself hoarse when they can't hear a word. Wally's doing wonderfully well. He's been driving on flat franks, that takes nerve. - All he needs is experience. - What he needs is a new car. He's driving a second-rate motor against the best cars in America. And the leaders ain't got rid of him yet. He's gonna take him on this lap. He'll have to leave before he comes around again. Look out, Wally, look out! He's going to drive Griffin off the track. No, he ain't, Griffin's trying to squeeze him. Hey, wait a minute, where are you going, young fellow? Why, I'm going in. Wally Storm's a buddy of mine. Now you just run along with you there. Yeah, but I gotta get in. I got something to tell the judge. Oh, so it's his honor you want to talk with. Well, then, just run along now. On with you, now, go on! Get along with you there. Good morning, sir. Raise your right hand. Do you solemnly swear to tell the truth, the whole truth... ...and nothing but the truth, so help you God? - I do. - What is your name? - Charles Taylor. - Sit down, please. What is your occupation, Mr. Taylor? Racing mechanic. I'd like to ask you to tell the exact words you heard the defendant, Mr. Wallace Storm, say to the deceased, Bob Griffin, just before the race started the night of the wreck at Ascot. Wally Storm said he'd get Bob Griffin, and he did. - We object, Your Honor. - Objection sustained. And the words "And he did" are hereby ordered stricken from the records. What did the defendant say to the deceased? Storm swore he'd run him off the track. Said it'd be Griffin's last race. I have here exhibit F. A diagram of the race track marked with a point at which the two cars came together. Point out where you were standing. I was standing right here by the inside rail. About halfway between the starting line and the first curve. About 150 yards from the crash. Now tell the jury in your own words exactly what happened. Well, Storm was coming up fast, He, um, cut in between Bob Griffin's car and the inside rail. Griffin pulled over to give Wally room to pass... But Wally didn't pass. He said he was going to run Bob Griffin off the track. Tell the jury the exact words you heard Wallace Storm... ...say to Bob Griffin just before the race started. He said he'd run Griffin off the track. He said it would be Griffin's last race. Said it would be Griffin's last race. Look, be a pal, will you? I want to go in. Now get along with you. I'm not going to be telling you again. All right, all right. Wait a minute, where do you think you're going? - I'm a witness for Griffin. - Where's your subpoena? Oh, I left that home. I'm a half hour late. Raise your right hand. Do you solemnly swear to tell... What are you doing here, Johnny? Why, I just crashed the gate. - How's he coming? - Shh! Now, Miss Sanford, were Mr. Storm's services as a mechanician satisfactory? Well, then what led him to leave your employ? He was discharged. Isn't it a fact that the deceased, Bob Griffin, was responsible for the defendant being discharged? Objected to. Calling for the conclusion of the witness. Objection sustained. Didn't the defendant tell you that he and Bob Griffin had had a fight? Yes, when he came to tell me goodbye. Did you hear him say to Bob Griffin... ...that he would run him off the track the night of the race? You'll have to answer, Miss Sanford. Yes. And just before the race in which Robert Griffin was killed, did you hear the defendant say to Bob Griffin... "This will be your last race."? He said if Bob crowded him it would be his last race. Now, Miss Sanford, isn't it a fact... ...that the defendant and Bob Griffin were jealous of each other? - Objected to. - Objection sustained. In your presence, did the difendant have a fight with the deceased? Answer yes or no. - Yes, but, um... - Did the defendant knock the deceased down? Well... yes. And you discharged the defendant. Yes, I thought it best. What, if anything, did the defendant say to the deceased at that time? Answer the question. He said he would get around to Griffin some day. After you knocked him down and Mr. Sanford had discharged you, did you say to Griffin you would settle his score if you ever met on the race track? Something to that effect. And the night Griffin was killed, you told him it would be his last race? I told him if he tried any rough stuff, I'd run him off the track. But I didn't. What happened on the track was an accident. Rather a convenient accident. You knew that Miss Sanford and Griffin were close friends. - Yes. - They'd gone with each other for years. She told me they'd known each other for years. Now isn't it a fact you were jealous of Griffin? - No. - Were you in love with Miss Sanford? Yes. That's all. Be seated. Has the jury reached a verdict? We have, Your Honor. The defendant will rise. We the jury find the defendant guilty of murder in the second degree. Take it easy, kid, you got ten years to shovel this coal. Yeah? If you keep going like this, you'll be weaving baskets in a year. Well, what difference does it make? If I could only do something for him. I can't figure it out. It's all to mixed up. Well, Wally had everything against him. That's all Maggie and I keep talking about. Yep, when I seen him taken away... Ten years, for what? I know how you feel, Bud. It's awful. I don't think so much about Griffin. The way I look at it is he got his for all the things he's done to other people. I keep blaming myself. Pitying myself for having to testify against him. I didn't want to. Well, when they slap those old subpoenas on you, you gotta go. This guy Taylor certainly developed a love for Griffin all of a sudden. If he hadn't sworn to those warrants, none would have happened. Accidents like that happen all the time on the tracks. He wouldn't even talk to me. Just kept looking at me. Don't let that fool you. He's in love with you. - I wish I could believe that. - You ought to go out and see him. No, I've written to him, but he hasn't answered. I guess he doesn't want to see me. Well, that's that. The bulldog ain't on the bank no more. In stir. The best man I ever knew, best friend, best mechanic, - plenty of brains, got what it takes. - Please, Bud! You won't see me around here no more either. I'm going up there. - Up to the prison? - Not far from it. I got an idea he'll be needing things. Pipe tobacco, books. He reads books. Ain't much he don't know. And what kind of work are you gonna get up there? I got a job with a company that does trucking for that stir. - What about Maggie? - Huh? Oh, Maggie, oh, she'll tag along, can't get rid of that girl. What are you and Mr. Sanford gonna do? Keep on building cars, I suppose. That's too bad, it's a shame. Well, I'll be going along. Any message? When you see Wally, Bud, tell him I'll be up to see him soon. Sure, kid. And tell him I'm for him a hundred per cent, will you? You bet your life I will. Thanks. So long, kid. So long, Bud. Johnny, you're not so friendly to me anymore, what's the matter? There's no sense in kidding, Miss Sanford. I think I'd better quit too. I don't like working here anymore. - Well, I'm sorry. - Yeah. - I'm sorry too. - Listen, Johnny, you mustn't blame me. It wasn't my fault. No, it ain't you so much. It's everything around here. Since Wally's gone, well... The place gives me the creeps. You know, I can't help thinking there's a tie up with... ...what I seen and what happened to Wally. What did you see? It was the day Wally was fired. I was in the tool shop and I saw those two no-good guys... Wait a minute, what no-good guys? Griffin, your driver, and Curley Taylor. I don't know what you're talking about. Look, they were standing right here where we are. And I couldn't hear nothing they were saying, but... They kept looking at that bolt. - Which, this one? - Yeah. Well, that's funny, that bolt doesn't belong there. Well, it was there, and they kept looking at it. Somebody put it there. But what for? Well, it was there then. And they held the tire up against it, something like this. It doesn't make sense. Oh, Dad, you frightened me. Look here. Did you ever see that bolt before? - No, what's it for? - And who put it there? Well, if you didn't, one of those two guys did. Wally locked his front wheel in here. That's how one of the mechanics at the trial explained the accident, but Wally's wheel didn't block, his tire blew out. It still doesn't make sense. Could that bolt puncture a tire? It might, but I hardly think so. Take it off. Sharp as a razor. - I've got an idea! Come with me, Johnny? - Where? Where are you going, Pat? I'm going to find the tire that was on Wally's wheel... ...and then I'm going to see Judge Alcott. - Come on, Johnny! - Right! Come on, let me in on it. What are we going to Curley's place for? Well, ever since the night of the wreck, the right front tire of Wally's car has been missing. I've got a hunch that Curley Taylor's got it... ...and I'm going to perform just a little bit of petty larceny. Remember we won't be much good to Wally if we end up in jail. I don't think we will. You see, Curley's got that repair shop. Yes, but... how do you know nobody'll be there? I telephoned him. Nobody's there. That's why we're going. Wait a minute. You mean you're gonna break in? Hey, you can't do that. You're a girl. That's why I got you, Johnny, you're my bodyguard. Think you can make it if I help you up? I guess so. Let's go. - Shh! - Alright. As soon as I get in, you go out front and I'll open the door. - All right, now be quiet. - I will. If there's anybody in here, I ain't doing a thing. Honest, not a thing. Come on in, there's nothing to be afraid of. Look! There's Curley's locker. Come on. It's locked. Try this. Johnny! It's the right size, 600 by 17. - Look, it's all ripped. - Johnny, it's it! My knees feel weak. - Come on, let's get out of here. - We'll take it to Judge Alcott. Gee, that's swell for Wally, cause I hear that prison foood is terrible. Come on! Can you arrange for a new trial? Well, I hardly think that will be necessary. I'll arrange for an appointment with the governor. - Boy, that's swell! - Thank you so much, Judge. Not at all. And I'm quite sure that it's only a matter of a day or two... ...before you'll have a complete pardon for Wally Storm. I'll telephone for the governor immediately. Tell him I said hello, will you? - Yes, I'll do that, son. - Goodbye. Goodbye. You see, Your Excellency, Wallace Storm was not responsible for the death of Bob Griffin. The device on Bob's car caused the wreck. It's a wonder both of them weren't killed. A regrettable blunder of justice. Judge Alcott's letter, the new evidence... ...and what you tell me show conclusively that Storm is not guilty. Then you will pardon him? Oh, I don't know how to thank you, what to say. You see, this means a great deal to me. I can thank you for the State if you can suggest a way. I should very much like to deliver the pardon to the warden at the penitentiary. I'll arrange for a messenger to go with you. Thank you so much. Seems like a mighty long way to carry this little box. Might have waited to carry it on a regular trip. Well, if you don't want to go, I'll pick you up on the way back. Tell the truth, I kinda likes goin' to the penitentiary. Makes me feel free. Yes, sir. Free. What's in this box? Oh, it ain't nothing much, just a cake my girl baked for Wally. Why are you troubled, Mr. Keene? I saw you go in a big shop and come back with this box. You all the time talking about your gal. I've been on this truck, let's see now, two weeks and I never seen her. - What's she look like? - She's pretty. And her name is Maggie. That's a nice name. Maggie. You're making it tough on the rest of us. --- Looks like you got something on your mind. If it's a dame, she'll be gone when you get out of here. - Forget her. - Nobody to forget! Nobody to remember. - What did she do to you, kid? - Nothing. Stop measuring this boiler with your eye. Those guards can read your mind. Eddy's right. Forget it, kid. Forget the dame. She ain't been to see you. She's passed you up. Alright, lower away. Take it easy. # And away we'll go # # Shuffle on to, shuffle on to # # Shuffle on to Buffalo # When I put this truck in the garage tonight, I'm through. How come you're through? Well, Maggie's getting sore about my being away all the time. Same thing about my gal. She's all the time ragging me. Now tonight I'm supposed to take her out to play bridge. Yeah, I know how it is, kid. If I had anybody up there to help me unload this truck, I'd let you go. Well, how come you gonna need me? Ain't you got more than 1000 prisoners up there to help you unload thus truck? That's right. Well, when I get to the next gas station... Alright, here's good enough for me, Mr. Keene. - So long, Mr. Keene. - Have a good time. The warden will see you now, Mrs. Roberts. Thank you. - Hello, Jim. - Hello. - Sorry to keep you waiting, Miss Sanford. - We've been waiting an hour now. - Didn't the governor telephone? - No, we had a little trouble after supper. What's the matter, didn't they like their chow? No, they got started while they were taking an old boiler out of the boiler room. We're not too late. The warden will release Mr. Storm tonight. - Mr. Storm? - Number 984. He'll be set free as soon as the warden gets the pardon. I have it right here. - Thank you... very much. - You're welcome, Mrs. Roberts. Pardon me. - What's that all about? - Trouble somewhere. Do you hear that? He'll never hear anything like that again. It's the prisoners yelling. Somebody has escaped. Come on, get on out of there. A con came out in your truck, don't lie about it. If he did, I didn't see him. I was in there all the time, I was in the prison. You was there, I was talking to you all the time... ...they was loading and unloading my truck. Watch him, Pete. - Black inside you can't see a thing. - There's room for two men in that firebox. That's where you'll find him, in that firebox. No, there's nobody in there, Cap. Well, I got one sure way of finding out. Hey, you, 984, if you're in there and know how to yell, I'm gonna shoot. Stand clear. Here goes. Well, if he was in there and had a gun, he can't use it now. He ain't in there. Come on. There's just one more place, under the driver's seat. - Already looked in there. - Oh, look again! He must have come out on your truck, that's the only way he could've gotten out. Wish I'd have known it, there's a reward for catching those guys, ain't there? Yeah, well, if you'd have caught this guy you'd have had a broken skull. He's one of those quick-thinking guys with plenty of stuff behind him. Glad I didn't get him. Alright, buddy, scram. Come on, boys. The bulldog on the bank. And the bullfrog in the pool. - Okay, Wally? - Okay, Bud. - Anybody around? - No. - Gee, that was a close shave. - I'll say it was. Come on, we gotta get busy. We gotta take off that contraption and put back the gas tank. You and I are going for parts unknown as soon as we get to Frank Field. Say, what are we gonna do when we get down there, Wally? We're going to change our names and burn up all the tracks in South America. It's a nonstop fight out of this country. You'll keep on going till we find a country where they can't bring you back. You've thought of everything, Bud. Oh, it wasn't me, it was Maggie, she planned it all. - Oh, good old Maggie. - Come on, let's get going. Okay. Este nuevo chofer es un demonio! Mira! Pero va a se matar! Est? pasando a todos como si fueran parados. This new timer is a daredevil! Oh, but he's gonna get killed! He's passing them all as though they were standing still! Oh, the bulldog on the bank... Bulldog Banks? And the bullfrog in the pool. Dad! I've got some interesting news for you! What is it? I've got some interesting news for you! Well, I could appreciate some these days. Well, if you're worried about winning that race at Dayton, forget it. I wish we had a driver who could win it. - I know one who can. - Name him and I'll get him. Bulldog Banks? Never heard of him. - He's the winner of the Argentine National. - That's a good recommendation. Dad, Bulldog Banks is Wally Storm. What? The papers say he's been driving in South America for the last two years. Wally probably went down there because there's no extradition. And remember, Daddy, he always used to sing... ...he bulldog on the bank and the bullfrog in the pool? You're right, Pat. I'm gonna write a letter to this Bulldog Banks... ...asking him to drive this baby in the Dayton 500 and we'll see what happens. As much as I'd like to see him, Pat, he'd be crazy to come back and take a chance. I've got a hunch he'll come back. I'm gonna write that letter. - Que quiere usted? - Tengo una carta para el Sr. Bulldog Banks. - Bulldog Banks? Si, adentro. - Est?? Se?ores, por aqui. - Que quiere usted? - Una carta para el Sr. Bulldog Banks. - Para el se?or Banks, verdad? - Perdone, debo entregarsela personalmente. Est? al?, cerca del bar. - Comprende? - Comprendo, comprendo. - The gentleman's now buying... - Perdone. Una carta para el Sr. Bulldog Banks. - Bulldog Banks? - Si, se?or. Bull... Mr. Bulldog Banks... Alright, I'll take it. Here's another for you, Wally, must have followed you all over the circuit. - Who's it from? - Oh, I haven't any idea yet. He's always getting love letters, always getting... Nobody ever writes me love letters, nobody except my good old Maggie. Aw, forget it, Wally, it can't be that important. Come on, I'll make you a first-class slipper-picker. It's about the Memorial Day races at Dayton. Almost forgot there ever was such a race. Did you get an offer to drive there? I don't suppose you'll ever see that racetrack again. Why not? - Why not what? - Why won't we see Dayton again? Oh, that... you know why. Uh, pardon us, will you, please? Come on, Bud, I want to talk to you. Ahem... you, um... you like it down here, don't you? Sure I like it. But you would like to go back, wouldn't you? - To see Maggie. - Oh, I'd like to see her, but I get a letter from her once in a while. I never see any of them. You know, I don't believe there is any Maggie. What are you talking about there ain't no Mag... Sure there's a Maggie. My Maggie's got it on all the girls down here. Whether there is or isn't a Maggie, I've grown to like her. It must be nice to have a girl. Even if she's only in your imagination. - What's got into you? - Nothing. Well, you were having a swell time until you got that letter. - Who's it from? - Bud, we're going to drive in that race at Dayton on Memorial Day. You haven't lost your mind, have you? They'll put you back in stir again. We get away with another one like we did before, we ain't cool dude. You're leaving by plane tonight. I'll follow a little later. I suppose there's no sense arguing with you. Uh, two martinis. Bud... This letter is from Patricia Sanford asking me to drive her car in that race. So we're going. Well, that's different, why didn't you say so? - I don't blame you for taking a chance. - If you leave here tonight, that'll give you just about a week to drive her car and test it. I'll stay here until the last minute. Then I'll hop into Dayton just in time to drive in that race... ...and hop right out before anybody has a chance to pick me up. - Here's to it, Wally. - Here's to it, kid. Extra. Special programs here, 25c. Names of the drivers and the numbers of their cars. Souvenirs as well as programs, 25c. A capacity crowd is here today... ...and the spectators are right up on the edge of their seats. Well, it won't be long now. The two favorites in the betting ring today are... ...a foreign car manufactured be Peugeot, and two American cars, one of which was designed by a woman. She's the daughter of the famous racing car designer Martin Sanford... ...and is the only woman in the state who holds a racings mechanician's license. Now, her driver, an American, is Charles "Bulldog" Banks. winner of the Argentine Gran Premio Nacional and racing champion of South America. Can't wait much longer, Miss Patricia. All the time I was designing this car I was thinking of Wally, Bud. I wanted him to drive it. I wish you'd wrote him that. He figured you didn't know who he was. How about it? If I tell you he ain't gonna show up, he ain't gonna show up. Come here. - How much did you put up? - As much as I said I would. I'll keep this. I'd put up more if I were sure the Sanford car was out of the running. The car ain't out of the running, but the driver is. If he ain't in the hoosegow now, he soon will be. How did you fix it? I got wise to this Bulldog Banks as soon as I seen Bud Keene. - I tipped off the cops. - Sure the cops will pick him up? Pick him up at the airport if they haven't done it already. Where do you think you're going, kid? Why, I'm gonna sit with Judge Alcott and Mr. Sanford. - Oh, no, you're not. - Why not, I got my ticket! - Why didn't you say so in the first place? - Come on, let me in. Goodbye, Johnny. Sure made that trip in a hurry. I'll say I did. I just got back from Frank Field... and he ain't landed yet, but the cops are waiting there to nab him... - Shh, that'll do, sit down. - Yes, but how's Wally gonna get here? - Wally? - Yes, Judge, Wally Storm. That's why I wanted you here today. I'll explain the situation. You see, my daughter Patricia has the idea that Wally Storm... Hey, Sam, you might as well gather up your tools... ...and pick yourself a good place to watch the race from. - Okay. - Hey, boys. I've just seen the judges and we're going to start the race with a substitute driver. I'm going as mechanic and you're going to drive, Bud. - Let's step on it, boys. - Yeah, but Miss Sanford, I... You've got a racing driver's license, haven't you? - Yeah, but... - Get in there and do the best you can... ...till Wally comes. South American flash Bulldog Banks has failed to show. Bud Keene mechanician will drive the Sanford special. Miss Sanford herself will occupy the extra seat. - Hope you ain't jittery, Miss Pat. - Not any more than you are, Bud. Let's go, boys. That's funny, wish I was in that seat. - A better man than you is in this seat. - Wish a better one than me was in this one. Here they come around the turn out into the stretch all naturally bunched. Coming down the stretch to griddle that old 500-mile grind. They're coming down to get the starters flag. There goes the flag! They're off! They've started! Looks like we've had this long trip for nothing. - Who's driving in your place? - No one. Must have defaulted. Wait a minute! Bud Keene's driving. He's in the seventh place. Good boy! Miss Sanford's in the mechanician seat. That's swell. Alright, step on it, Louis! That substitute driver for the Sanford car is driving high, wide and handsome, Too wide. He and his little mechanician have dropped back to eighth place, but they don't lack nerve. They're trying to hold out to the tails of the leaders. And listen to the shout of the crowd when they pass! Five coming up! Stay next to the rail, don't let him get inside! How I wish Wally was here! You're doing swell! Let her out, you're doing 140! Yeah, but I can't keep her on the track at 100! Gotta go in the pits! Tires! Keep going, they're alright! Wally's trying to get here, I know it! Well, he won't help much now! It isn't too late! Keep up that pressure! Airplane overhead! Don't look! Alright, Louis, let her down in the infield! - I don't know whether I can make it! - Take a chance! Okay! He's circling lower! Wally wouldn't waste time. He'd go somewhere and land. He's going to land, look! Don't look! Go to the pits! Hurry up and hop off before they grab you. Bulldog Banks has just made an appearence in an airplane... ...and has landed right in the center of the infield. Yessir, that is something! - Hello, Wally, glad you're here! - Hello, Pat, glad to see you. I couldn't do nothing in that track, it's like ice. - You did alright. - Well, get in here, we're ready to roll. She knows more about this car than I do. Listen, I gotta take a lot of chances, I don't want you to. Forget it, let's go, boys! They're pushing the Sanford car out of the pits right now. Now we'll see if this man lives up to his reputation. Wait and see. The cops will drag him off the track and take him to the hoosegow. They're taking the first turn and look at him take it! This is a driver! Now he's going up through the field in the back stretch, boy, oh, boy! Calling car 34. Car three four. Pick up Wallace Storm. Wallace Storm. Alias Charles "Bulldog" Banks, racing driver. Now driving in the Dayton 500. Described as follows. American. 6'1'', 187lb, brown hair, small dark moustache, escaped from the penitentiary June 6th, 1933. Take no chances, boys, that is all. Oh, boy, what a break! We'll get to see part of that race! Yeah, it's a swell a break, I gotta go pinch the guy that I got a bet on! Come on, Wally! Come on, Wally! Take him on the turn! Why didn't you take him on the turn? Say, ain't you on the wrong side of that track, lady? Got over here and couldn't get back. My brother's riding with Cy Porter. Well, that's different. I suppose all these mechanics was giving me the razz when I was driving. They were not, they were pulling for you. Wish I'd been in that car with you. Yeah? Come on, Wally, attaboy! So you see, judge, that's how it happened. Let's wait till after the race, Sanford, I'm getting too big a kick out of this. Did you come up all the way from South America just to win this race? You don't think I came up just to drive through a fence. I don't care. I wouldn't be here if I wasn't ready to go places with you. There's one place you didn't go with me. To prison. You're wrong. I was in the warden's office the night you escaped. Bringing me cigarettes? - Bringing you a pardon. - Huh? Look out, watch the track, we're doing 118. You ruined it all. They've been after you ever since for jail-breaking. Pat. If I wasn't riding, I'd make a demonstration right now. - Well, give a demonstration of driving. - Okay! Hold on to your hat, here we go! Say, did we come out to see the races or make a pinch? In the first place, I can't arrest a guy that's going 120 mph. Second place, he ain't going anywhere except around in circles. Third place, if he does try to get away, they'll pick him up in an ambulance and fourth place, I don't wanna miss this race. - I got dough on him. - Suppose he wins for you. Win or lose, I'll slip the bracelets on him. Of course, if he does win, I'll do it kind of gentle-like. Well, what are you going to say now? Those radio cops are gonna wait until the race is over before they arrest him. That means we lose. Maybe I can fix that too. - What's your name? - I don't like my name. You won't like it either. Let's skip it. If we're going to go together steady, we'll skip nothing. Alright... Bud. My name's Maggie. Maggie? Am I glad to hear that. Maggie. Pardon me. I want to speak to Judge Alcott. - Alright, Curley. - Thanks. Pardon me, Judge, I guess you remember me, I was a witness in one of your cases. Oh, yes, I remember you. - Taylor, isn't it? - Yes, that's right. Charles Taylor. What do you want? I want to tipo you off about this guy Bulldog Banks. Oh, you're going to squeal, eh? This is the guy I was telling you about, judge. He's the mug that was talking to Griffin in our shop that day. And he's the one that framed Wally. The boy doesn't know what he's talking about, judge. - Suppose we just forget it. - Just a moment. - Officer! - Yes, sir. Come here, please. - Officer, I want you to make an arrest. - Yes, judge, who is it? This man, on suspicion of a felony in the case State v. Stone. - Hey, wait a minute, you can't do this to me. - Come on! Oh, yeah? Well, he's doing it. Nice going, judge. Nice going. Bulldog Banks is right on the tail of the Italian driver. Both of them have broken the track record. Since he started driving, Banks has averaged 114mph on a slippery track for 160 laps. His little mechanician is with him again. She rested for 50 laps. The Bulldog has less than two laps to pass Giuseppe Aldressoni. And does that Italian stick to the pole! Come on, he's passing 4! Come on, Wally, come on! Get up there, Wally, attaboy! Here they come down the stretch to that good old checkered flag at the finish line. Banks has a chance to win a lot of money, to say nothing of the glory. They're neck and neck! Hu puts on a burst of speed! Shoots out in front, leaves his rival behind and shoots toward the line! There he goes over! Banks wins! Everybody get away from this car! I'm sorry, but you'll have to come along with us. What for, speeding? - Oh, howdy, judge. - How are you... Nice going, Wally! Don't worry, Miss Stanford, your dad and were talking to the judge and everything is jake. Johnny, if I ever get married and you're not to old, I'm going to adopt you. Oh, boy! Miss Patricia, I want you to meet my girfriend Maggie. Well, how do you do? Bud, I'll never doubt you again. Wally, Miss Sanford said if I ain't got a long gray beard... ...when you ask her to marry you, she's gonna adopt me. - Wally, I did no such thing! - Kid, you're adopted! - Subtitles - Lu?s Filipe Bernardes
