Raise the flag. Ready? Alexandria! What? We've arrived in Alexandria! Bye, Mr. Ragab. Ragab! Will you return with us? No. Fynn wanted to remind you of the hot potato tray. I remember it. Why all the hurry? I just told him. Tell him to send it hot. Okay, Mr. Ragab. I'll send it hot tomorrow morning. Don't forget, the ship departs at 10 a.m. I'll send it before sunrise. Safe travels! Welcome! -The Winch is back, guys. -Welcome back, Winch. Shake hands. How are you, Morsi? -Welcome. -Welcome back, Winch. How are you, guys? I missed you, guys. -Welcome back, Winch. Where were you? -Hi. In India, China and countries with elephants. You must've traveled around the world. From east to west, there's no place that I haven't seen. You must've had fun, Winch. As much as I could. I missed you, guys. Will you stay or will you go travelling again? Only God knows. Welcome back, Winch! Welcome back, Winch! Welcome, Ragab! Don't forget to serve tea for Mr. Antar. Okay, chief. Don't fight them, boy! I told you, okay, chief! You just say that, but you never listen for real. Here's your coffee. Where is the tea, Gouda? What's wrong, chief? Serve the tea, boy. Do you need anything else? Oh, God! Oh, God! Mr. Ragab! Mr. Ragab is back, chief! I wanna kiss the ship that brought you back. Thank you, guys. -I wanna hug him first. Welcome back. -I missed you, guys. -Ragab! My dear! -Hi. Welcome back! My dear mom! Welcome back, Ragab. Welcome back, my son. Don't do that, chief. Be strong. I missed you, Ragab. You've been away for three years! Enough crying and kissing in front of the guys, Mom. What guys? Let me kiss and hug you. Okay, Mom. You're still so young in my eyes. Yeah, Mom. Don't you dare think about travelling again. Are we going to talk here on the road? Shouldn't I rest and have some coffee? Answer me, will you go travelling again? No, dear. I'll tear up my passport for you. May God please your heart as you've pleased mine. I'll please your heart and let you rest. I came back with a good sum of money. You'll get a break from work, and... Are you looking for Hamedah? She is serving tea at the end of the pier. I'll go to her, Mom. Get her and come to the ferry. Okay, Mom. This sharbat is on me, chief. May I drink sharbat at your wedding, Gouda. Trill, chief. Stop, Gouda. Trill, chief. Please. O Allah, bless Muhammad. Hey, boy, behave or I'll make you. I'm your servant. What servant? Behave for your own sake! I can't control myself, Hamedah. A fire is burning in my heart. Your heart? May it hurt! I'll put out the fire in your heart, you shameless, mean, crude... Let him be! Ragab! Ragab! Where were you? How are you? When did you get back? Don't hit me, isn't it enough that you beat up that man like that? No. If someone doesn't keep themselves within bounds, I'll beat them up. Yeah, you're the same strong girl. A girl who is... O God, bless the prophet. If you hadn't sent me a photo of you, I wouldn't have known you. And your uppercut is... crafty. And you'll like my headbutt. That too? Yeah, do you wanna try me? For what? Let's be nice. Come and tell me where you've been. There's no place I haven't traveled to. I've been to all corners of the world. Mr. Ragab. The chief went to the ferry and wants you to follow her there. Tell her we're coming. What's up? What are you looking at? Nothing. You seem like... Do you wanna follow that guy? Oh, you! Mom. -Come here. Come here, girl. -Mom. Hurry up, Mr. Ragab. The ferry leaves soon. Wait up, we're coming. What? Ragab! Welcome back, Ragab! Uncle Ismail! Welcome back, long time no see! How are you, Ragab? I missed you, Uncle Ismail. I missed you too, I wanna talk with you. At your service, chief. I'll visit you at your house. It will be my honor. Give it to me. Welcome. This is a good day. Behave, girl. Sit down. Oh, God! God is one! There are men here, sit down. Shame on you! You scared the girl. She dances! She's happy about you, so she dances. She's not a little girl anymore, she has grown up, Mom. You upset her, go and make up with her. Go on. Hamedah. Hamedah. Oh, God! Why all this hatred? What's wrong, girl? Did someone bother you? Hamedah. Answer me or I'll hit you, I swear. That was a long time ago. And now? If you do, I'll hit you in the leg with the end of my shoe. Did you forget the old days' beat-downs? Not anymore, if you bother me, I'll bother you back. "Behave, girl!" Do you think you're still that little girl who nobody can stand in the way of? What happened to me then? All the time I was traveling, I was asking myself, "Has she changed? How is she doing? Will I find the same girl? Or..." Or what? What? I missed you. You only missed one thing. What do you mean? My auntie's mulukhiyah. I've wanted a dish of it so bad. I'll make it for you today with rabbits. Then we're good. I love your auntie's mulukhiyah. Do you wanna hear the truth, girl? I didn't miss mulukhiyah or any other food. I only missed the fruit. I mean... You mean what? You, girl. You behave then! I was always thinking about you, "How is she doing? What does she look like now? Is her hair long? Or has she cut it? Are her eyes still black? Or have they become honey-colored?" So that's why you've been gazing at since you got back. I hadn't guessed I'd come back to find that you'd grown this beautiful. So was I ugly when I was younger? You were just a little girl. Yeah, an unripened fruit. That's a good one. Hit it. Oh, God! Greet him, that's Mr. Mamdouh. -Who? -Just wave. Welcome back, Winch! I'll visit you. Welcome! We will be pleased! -We will be honored! -We will wait for you! Yeah, we will wait for you! Wasn't he abroad? No, he wasn't, he's working with his dad at the company. Mamdouh is working! In a very high position. The same Mamdouh who I used to walk with and fix his motor, has become... Their manager. In his father's position. But he's still the same person, a humble one. You know him well. He is our customer, he has a daily share in the restaurant. What does he have? Beer? No, Kushari. I deliver it to him daily. He invited me once to the speedboat and we went around the whole port. He was driving too fast. Wow! Really? How are you, Hanafi? Your father, mother and the manager are upstairs. Fill it with four gallons. Okay. Your favorite guy came back. -Who? -The Winch. Really? I missed him. Why is Mr. Mamdouh bothered? When someone takes a manager's job, it's to work, not to rest. And Mamdouh can do it. He is my son, and I know him well. Good morning. -Good morning. -Good morning. Why are you talking about me? The lady thinks that I disagree with you being the company's manager. For two months I've been the manager only by name. The actual management is in your hands. God forbid, sir! All the employees know that you're the manager. When I ask any employee about anything, he replies, "I don't know, ask Mr. Ezzat." Sir, starting tomorrow morning, all specialties will be under your control. And starting tomorrow, I'll be in the office at eight o'clock. Yes, sir. Would you excuse me? Don't forget to come to the party this afternoon, Ezzat. How can I forget, sir? -Peace be upon you. -Peace be upon you. Peace be upon you. Why did you push the man like that? What would happen if he got angry and left work? Business would be interrupted. So what? He has his excuse, he can't get a hold of him. He just takes the speedboat out all day long on tours around the port. I don't do that for fun. I try to connect with the workers, to find out what their demands are. -But I can't. -Mamdouh. Starting tomorrow, you must take your position. Even if that man leaves the company. That would be better. Excuse me. See you later, dear. I can't keep him unoccupied until his hopes are ruined. Let's see what he does. He'll do well. But encourage him instead of discouraging him, Fadel. Let's go and see what they've accomplished. Let's go. What? Did the house change? No, but hasn't it got smaller? See you later, skipper. You were gone for a long time, my son. What's this? This is for Mom. And this... This is for you. Shame on you! Am I a little girl? How could I have known that you would get angry like this? Anyways, does this backup work? They are very light. Now we're talking. I told you not to stare like that, or I will stumble and fall. They are from Hong Kong. The girl who you stole them from, was she pretty? They are new, they cost three rubles. Keep them on! -They will wear out. -I'll buy you another pair. -Will you go travelling again? -Yeah. Go travelling then. Why? Where will he go? No, Mom. I'm staying to work. I will control the pier. Take this and put it in the safe. Behave, boy. I swear I missed you. Watch out for the shoes. I'll go and show them to Zubaida. What's this for? For the future. We're in good condition, thank God. Keep it to give it to your bride-to-be. Keep it safe then. Oh, my God! I'm sorry! On the contrary, you wouldn't be you if this didn't happen. Have you seen what Ragab brought me? -Who is that Hamedah? -It's Mr. Mamdouh. Mamdouh. I'm coming fast. Are we going to stay like this? Stand up. -Okay. -Stand up! Welcome, Mr. Mamdouh. Welcome back, Winch. Welcome, Mr. Mamdouh. Give me a hug. I'm here to greet my friend with the language we're used to. Give me your hand. Hit it. Wow, you've gotten good. Ragab. I want you to fix my big yacht. Are you going travelling or what? Yes, I'll get married. Take a cigarette. Take one. Will you take the bride-to-be onboard? God willing. Light it. Excuse me, Mr. Mamdouh. Enough with this Mr. Mamdouh thing. Light it. It's your fault that I smoke, you taught me. How are you going to leave work and go travelling? Work isn't important. You're the manager now. What manager? Leave it to God. Nobody cares about me. They are right, 'cause you're just a kid. -Behave, girl. -Let her be, we're used to each other. Here you are. A manager! Are you kidding me? How could you understand these matters? I'm smart. Oh, God! This juice is very good. What juice? It's called hibiscus tea, boy. Cheers. Cheers. Thanks. I'll be working as a manager starting tomorrow. I'll hire you as a foreman. All workers love you and will obey you. -I need your help. -I'm all yours. Then you'll have done me two favors that I won't forget. This is one of them, what's the other? When I nearly drowned and you saved me. Do you remember? I remember. Can I count on you? Count on God. Later. Later. Go, Hassan. Didn't I tell you he was kind? He hired me as a foreman. None of our company's ships have departed on time, because your work is poor. Everything can be fixed, Captain. If the ship doesn't depart on time at 10 a.m. tomorrow, the contract with your company will be terminated. Here. What's this? -A warning? -Yes, a warning. Hey, Monem. How did it go? I made Ismail and his men think they're gonna get fired. And what did they do? They are very angry. Look. What did you tell them? I told them Uncle Borai was waiting for you in the office to sign the contract. Well done. Is it right that you chose Borai? Was I the one who did that? After 20 years of work, you fire us in this mean way? I'm doing the impossible. Very good, Monem. This is the first step. There's more to come. The coffee, Hussein. Give it to me. Will you drink your coffee here? No. I'll drink it then. The captain gave us a warning. Good. Now Ismail and his men think that we no longer need their services. Yes, of course. So now they won't work or load the ship. Of course. And the ship won't depart on time. Yeah. And the captain will carry out the warning and we lose their line. And Fadel goes out of business. And the new manager, Mr. Mamdouh, too. Why not? A manager! After working with him for 20 years and sacrificing my youth and life, he brings in his spoiled son and makes him a manager. Yeah, so he seizes the work as his father seized the company and its daughter. Let him be the manager of nothing. But Borai and his men must be ready. What? Borai is waiting for you inside, and his men are on the pier. When the others see them, they will lose their minds. And it will be a big fight. Get down there and make the situation worse. Okay. -Welcome, Chief Borai. Congrats. -Hello, Mr. Ezzat. The boss won't hire anyone but you. We will fire Ismail and his men. Are your men ready? -Very. -Be careful, Borai. Ismail's men might pester you. O God, bless the prophet. I'll run them over with my new Jeep. Yeah, when I say your name, I want-- Everything will be done before you even say my name. -Peace be upon you. -Peace be upon you. Do you want me to send you the Jeep tomorrow, to take it for a ride? No, thanks a lot. Don't mention it. Turn the engine on, Bomba. Come and see, it's beautiful as a bride. -Come on, Bomba. -See you later. They want to stop the work. Why? And then what? Will they keep Uncle Ismail, or will they bring in Borai or someone else? Do you think we should do nothing? We would destroy everything over their heads. And over the company owners' head. We wouldn't be real men if they fired us and hired someone else. Is that Borai? Go, Bomba. You trying to run us over or what? Excuse me, guys. The brakes are a little bit off. How are you, Uncle Ismail? Praise be to God. I'm sorry, that's life. Ups and downs. When pigs fly. Behave, girl. Never mind, Ragab. Treat her kindly. Welcome back to the pier, Winch. Thanks. What do you intend to do, Ragab? I'll work. Really? Do you hear that, guys? Ragab says he'll work. What's up, dirty boy? Are you gonna talk to me like that? Ugly men curse Sultans. Excuse him, there's no time for this. I need you, Winch. I'm entering a big load of work and I'll need lots of men. Don't ignore the work process, Chief Borai. Preparing workers comes after receiving work details, not before. The work is assured, Chief Ismail. Let's go, boy. When pigs fly, Borai. Shut up, girl. What? Didn't you hear what he said? He's rude. Not as rude as you. Go to the chief and make her talk to him. Are you shutting me up? Go to the cafe. Did you hear what they said? What, chief? Will we do nothing? They have been threatening us with Borai for three months. He must've taken the job. It's clear from what he said. If that's true, we will do something about it. You must interfere and settle this matter, Ragab. Mamdouh is your friend, and he loves you. With one word you can settle this. I don't care about the job itself. But it'd be a shame for it to end this way. Is Mr. Ezzat standing with us or with Borai? He is standing with us, and he fought with us a lot. Talk to him then. I've talked to him many times. I'm embarrassed to talk to him again. He always says that the matter isn't in his hands. Leave it to God, but it'd be better to understand this stuff with Mr. Ezzat before we talk to Mamdouh. Mr. Ezzat. Mr. Ezzat. -Mr. Ezzat. -What? What's up? -We forgot a very important thing. -What's that? The Winch is back today. -Ragab? -Yeah. So what? Ismail is close with Ragab as you know. And Ragab is close with Mr. Mamdouh. Uncle Ismail may ask him to fix the issue. And they may find out that we're the cause of all this. Okay. He is coming with Uncle Ismail. What's the name of the girl we once saw with Mamdouh on the speedboat? Ragab's relative. Her name is Hamedah. His cousin. Okay then. Leave Ragab to me and get down with the rest of the men. He's coming. I said okay, you go! Can we see Mr. Ezzat? Firing people for no reason is forbidden. Enter. They were our men for a long time. You don't know Borai, sir. Borai isn't like us. And his men will rebel fast and misbehave. If you insist, then it's settled. Yes, sir. What a shame! Welcome. How are you, Ragab? Have a seat, why are you standing? What seat? I'm so annoyed. Did you hear my call with Mr. Fadel? That's unjust. May God treat him accordingly. Uncle Ismail has worked well with him for 20 years. Why then? How would I know? Borai is the one on his mind now. If I had known, I would've talked to Mamdouh. Did you see him? He came to the house to welcome me back. Mamdouh came to your house! Yeah, why are you surprised? We grew up together and we're close friends. Good for him. Did Mamdouh, the spoiled boy who loves speedboats and trips, come to see you at home to welcome you back? Maybe. Why wouldn't he? Maybe. By the way, how is your cousin Hamedah? Fine. I haven't seen her in a while. I was at sea once and saw her on the speedboat with Mamdouh. With Mamdouh? On what occasion? Hanging out. Getting some fresh air. Ragab. Stay away from the problem with the workers. We were saying that Fadel was bad, and it turns out that Mamdouh is worse. That's strange, Mamdouh was like you, son. And you're at your friend's place. See for yourself. Ragab, my son, don't judge a book by its cover. And be careful. Keep the people you care about safe. That's strange. None of them told me. They can't tell you. They are afraid and ashamed. Mamdouh is disloyal, you can't trust him. You know that they are close and will figure something out. Here he comes, the Winch is here. -What did he tell you, Ragab? -He doesn't seem happy about it. What did he tell you? Answer us, tell us. I swear I won't give you a dish! Will you give me a kushari dish? No. No. Okay, wait. Oh, God! Give it to me. Give it to me. -Take it. -Oh, God! Have you lost your mind, girl? Isn't that a shame? It's a shame because it didn't hit your face. Give me another one, come on. That's good. You'll find the rope in the back. Tie up the boat, and I'll be with you in a second. Wow, chicken or turkey isn't as tasty as this kushari. Excuse me, but there are some people who have poor taste. I don't like all kushari, only the one you make. I like eating it with this small spoon, in this small dish, with this red duqqa on it and when we're alone. You confuse me. I brought you a bucket of paint. You won't find anything like it, even in America. Take this for now, chief What about the rest of the check? When will you pay it? Things will get better soon, chief. Get better soon? We'd like to inform you that the call for the Asr prayer is at 2:35 p.m. Cairo local time. Where's Hamedah? She took the food for Zubaida's workers. Do you need something, dear? No. Mr. Mamdouh. Here is the paint. Are you happy now? Yes, I'm happy. I'm happy because you thought of me. -Tell me, where did you steal it from? -No. Please tell me. From your dad's warehouse. Behave, Hamedah. I'm not insulting you, it's true, it's from the company's warehouse. What if the warehouse keeper caught you? Leave it to God. Do you want me to steal a speedboat for you? Oh, God! This is a good example of how good our guards are. Don't mind it. I'm the youngest thief on the pier. I'm honored. -Hamedah. -Yeah. Does Ragab know that you're here? No, why? He might get upset. Why would he? I'll tell him that I brought you the paint. -Mr. Mamdouh. -Yeah. Is it true you have a party tonight? Yeah, right. So will you be late for the guests? Seems so. What? It seems so! And won't your mom get upset with you? Your mother. Won't your mother get upset with you? Yes, she will get upset. Oh, God, aren't you afraid? I'm shaking. No, Mr. Mamdouh. You shouldn't. Who would make the good people wait? What do you mean by "good"? The rich people. Those are people who tire themselves and others out, and they are not happy. I don't like fake lives. I like living freely so that I'm not deprived like my dad. Shut up, are you kidding me? Is your rich dad deprived? He is deprived of laughter from his heart, the ability to say whatever he likes and even from cursing. It seems like the kushari was rotten. You mean I'm rambling a little bit, right? A lot, not a little bit. Thanks. Go to your mom or she'll get upset with you. Your mother! Won't you behave? What? So, you have a mother who does everything and throws you a party, and you upset her! May God keep your mother for you. I wish I had a mother. Why? Isn't Ragab's mother... May God keep her for me. She raised me and tired herself. But that doesn't mean I don't want to have a mother. A real mother. And a father. And a brother. I'm ready to be your father and brother and... And my mother. Anyone you wish in this life. Will you do everything I say? Ready. Give me a ride then. Let's paint the cutter first. We'll be late. It's the big cutter. Oh, God! What's up, Abdu? He's not in his room, madam. And his suit is on the bed. Didn't he call? No, madam. -Once he comes back, let me know. -Okay, madam. Where's Mamdouh, Auntie? At the company working, but he'll be here soon. So he threw this big party and went to work! Excuse me for a moment. Of course. He was afraid we wouldn't load it on time. -How is that possible? -I told him it was nonsense. -He's a good man. -Mr. Ezzat. -Yes, madam. -Is Mamdouh working at the company? His work starts there tomorrow. That's strange. He's not at the company or here, where is he? Don't worry about him, madam. Young men are like butterflies, they always fly around beauty. As if you know where he is. The speedboat is nearby and lots of people know him. It's none of our business. When he starts work tomorrow, then it's our business. -Thanks. -You're welcome. -Can I have a word with you, Fadel? -Of course, madam. Come in. Come in. What's wrong, Ragab? I'm here... Do you want Mamdouh? He talked to me about the yacht's motor. And I wanna talk to him about a few things. Mamdouh isn't here, Ragab. You're the one who should tell us where he is. When you see him, tell him the guests are asking about him. Who is that Ezzat? Is he Ragab? Yes, he is, sir. I was told he came back today. Yes, sir. What a shame! I wish I could welcome him back. He came to assure me about work. What's up? Up till now, everything was good. Very good. And when Mr. Mamdouh starts working, it will be better. Please, Ezzat. Take care of him. It goes without saying, sir. I've made all the preparations. Thanks. What will we do after sitting around like this? Tell us if there will be a night shift. Be patient, guys. Those guys aren't going to end this well, chief. Ragab is here, let's hear what he has to say. What can Mr. Ragab do? He is Mr. Mamdouh's friend. What's the news, Ragab? Did you meet Mr. Mamdouh? His car is outside. You must find a solution for us. Where? Parked on the pier outside. And he took the speedboat out to sea. Why didn't he go after him? What's holding him back? These men are very upset. You asked us to wait for Ragab, what did he do? He came back empty handed. Here's Mr. Ragab, should we be happy? If one of you has something to say, keep it to yourself. And whoever doesn't like it, tell me. What's up, boy? What were you whispering about? Nothing, Mr. Ragab. Don't act dumb or I'll break your neck. Where's Mr. Mamdouh? He went out with the speedboat a little while ago. Alone? What's wrong with you, Ragab? Mamdouh is a straightforward and decent man. How do you know that we're talking about Mamdouh? What? You're so good. Real friends. What will we do now? Should we start the night shift or wait? Do whatever you want. There's no power but of God. Hamedah. Hamedah. What? What's that in front of you? Guess. I don't know. It's a gift, and you can't have it unless you guess what it is. Didn't I tell you if you gave me another gift I'd be upset? It's a little something, for the paint. I stole it. For stealing it then. -Let me see. -No, guess. Harissa. It's not food. Clams? You're close. Just show me. Is this for me? Will I wear it? Will it fit me? Come. This dress shouldn't be hidden away. What? Do you know what I imagine while you're sitting there? What? I imagine you as a princess. Don't make fun of me, please, there are no princesses now. Every guy has a princess in his dreams. He imagines her as he likes. And I... I'm strange. The princess in my dreams looks exactly like you. Your looks, your voice, your moves and even your laugh. Is that even possible? Princesses have servants, clothes, and palaces. They can read and write, and they don't get beaten everyday like me. She looks like you in every aspect. Your dreams are so poor. Don't think about her and these dreams, let's stay awake, it's better. My name is Hamedah and my late dad's name is Haji Abdel Dayem. We're poor people. -How do you know -Whose daughter could I be? A king who was passing by our neighborhood and I fell out of his pocket? Maybe, why not? Maybe you're a mermaid who came out of the sea. -Why? Do I smell like fish? -Oh, God! Excuse me, Mr. Mamdouh. You say beautiful things, but... Come back, Hamedah, where are you going? I'll take it off and put it back in its box. It's the cause of everything, I'm not fit for this. Hi, Mr. Ezzat. I'm Monem. Your guy is furious. Very furious. With a little push he'll destroy everything. What? I'm the one to push him? Find someone else to do it. I can't. He wants to fight the air around him. What are you saying? What? The workers stopped working. Uncle Ismail? He is too upset. Where should I meet you? Okay. I'm waiting for you. You're funny. Enough, girl. Once we arrive, jump and tie the speedboat to the dock. What? You're the one who should do that, not me. You have to get off first, aren't I a princess? All I can think about is you stealing the paint. Isn't it better than stealing money? Come on, get off, fast. Ragab. I painted some good paint! Get away from here, slut! I said go away! What have you done? Have you lost your mind? Where were you? -Answer me! -We were painting a boat at the pier. -You're admitting it! -Do you want me to lie to you? How could you take her out with you on the speedboat? Why not? Really? In public? In front of everyone? Is that what upset you and made you hit her like that? What? Are you acting dumb? Ragab, did you forget that we're friends? We were friends. And we will be relatives, don't worry. I'll marry her. Who said so? I love her, Ragab. And I'll marry her. You? I'm ready to sacrifice everything for her. Do you think you can buy her with your money? Mamdouh, the son of a very wealthy man, marries a poor, orphan girl like Hamedah! Why? That's too old a story. That's what will happen. That marriage can't happen. Why, brother? You should be happy that someone good loves and wants to marry her. She's my cousin, and I can't let anyone get near her. Ragab. Do you love her? Love her? Do you love her? Who is she for me to love her? I traveled around the world. And you! Would you sacrifice everything? You're nothing without the money that came to you out of nowhere. I won't let you buy her. Say that you love her too. You're jealous. You love her. Answer me. I've been working in hell for three years for her. How could I have known it was for her? Did you tell me? Did you tell her anything before you left? Answer me. I told you, she's my cousin. Yeah, so you took her for granted till it suited you. Did you tell her that you loved her? Did you tell me? You! What are you? You took advantage of my absence, right? It's my fault that I worked like a slave. Busy. Blind. A nice opportunity, right? A nice opportunity! There's no need for those bad thoughts. I'll tell you one thing. I can't live without her. All I want is to marry her and make her happy. And that will happen. And me? What about me? That won't happen. I'll kill her. That can't happen. I'll kill you both. Kill me if you want, but that won't stop me from loving her. And what will you get out of that? Hamedah will have a rough life and you will be imprisoned. Think about it, Ragab. Let circumstances decide between us. Of course, you're sure of your money. No. I'm sure of my heart. Have you lost your mind? Coming back with Mamdouh? So what? I delivered the paint to him, should I have swam back? You're a grown up now. Everything you do, Ragab should know about it. Ragab treats me like an animal. When I say anything, he hits me. Mamdouh tells me that I'm a princess. Oh, my God! What's this child's talk? You're all gonna drive me crazy and make me leave. He came back just to hit me. Who? Ragab, who do you think? You deserve it, he's teaching you to be polite. Thanks. I'm already polite. I swear, I'll smash his head in! You can't. I can. Are you back to hit me again? I'll kill you. Enough. How could you get on the speedboat with him? Oh, my God! He's gonna kill me! Answer me. You know. No, I don't know. So now you hit me, and a long time ago you used to make me carry gasoline containers for Mr. Mamdouh. And you asked me to bring kushari to Mr. Mamdouh. And the paint we stole together for him. And all that playing and laughter was for whom? The customs officer? What were you doing with him today? He was rebuilding a boat. I stole the paint for him from his dad's warehouse. And I took the bucket and a kushari dish to him and then we worked, he painted the cutter and I rebuilt it. And when we were done, he brought me back. I was a little too late and then you slapped me, we're even. Stop this rudeness, stop it! Don't hit me, I'm telling you! You've seen nothing. I'll kill you and throw you to the fish. Go inside. Why are you rambling right now? What's bothering you? Poverty! Do you know what poverty means? What poverty? We're in good condition, praise be to God. Good condition? Like this broken chair? Like this unstable table? Or like this new divan here? Good condition! For three years I've been deprived of the sun, family, and love. Working like a slave in the dirt and coal. Buried for months. I only got out when we arrived at a port. You're back now, and in good health, my son. We're back together, praise be to God. Shut up, Mom. You know nothing. What's there to know? Why are you so upset? How will you benefit from this? Its benefit is that it reminds me that people must be hated. Oh, my God! I stock up hatred so that I never forget what people do to me. We are not the poor people who can be kind to other people. Why would other people love us? Only wealthy people are loved! Come in, Mr. Ezzat. Come in. What? Are you eating? Don't bother yourself. I wanna have a word with you. What? What's wrong? Why are you angry? Is there something wrong? No, have a seat. I'm honored. I swear I won't stay in this house! -Go inside, girl! -Mom! What's wrong, Ragab? Did something happen? No. Have you lost your mind? What have you done? I swear I won't stay here. Where will you go? Do you have any other home but this one? I'll even sleep on the pier. Whoever wakes the demon up, gets lost. Wait till we see what Ezzat wants from my son. Ask him, how would I know? He's deceitful. I've known him my whole life. He is evil. Those people must be taught a lesson. What did Ismail and his men do to be replaced by Borai and his men? May God avenge them. And Mr. Mamdouh pretended to care about us. He turned out to be worse than his dad. He wants to buy the whole world with his money, Mr. Ragab. Of course you care about the interests of Ismail and his men. Of course. They can threaten Fadel now. If the loading is late tonight Fadel and his son will lose the company. Okay? -So you have... -What do you want from me? ...to make the workers stop loading. Borai's men will work. Why? When do workers agree to do each other's work? This can't be. Once Fadel hears about this, he will renew the contract with Ismail immediately. The ship won't be loaded. I like you. This is their only chance to stay in business. And your chance to take revenge on Mamdouh. It's Ismail and his men. What? Talk to him outside. I don't want anyone to see me here. Why? I'm too embarrassed to see Ismail because I couldn't help him. I'll meet them outside. Don't let them load the ship. Don't forget that you're hitting two birds with one stone. You're doing this for their sake, and you're making Mamdouh go broke to get even. So that nobody is better than the other. What's wrong, Ragab? We're counting on God and on you, then you leave us and go home! This is no time to count on others. Did you meet Mr. Mamdouh? Listen, guys. Those bastards betrayed you and signed a contract with Borai. Tonight is your last day of work with them. There's no power but of God. Do you accept betrayal? All your life's work. If it's present-- Don't upset these men, my son, Ragab. There is an employment office, and there's law. And God is just. Tonight is your chance. If you miss it, you lose. If you stop loading, Fadel will renew your contract with the company. No, Ragab. Stopping the loading process leads to prison, it's accountability and going out of business. And that is never a good thing. I'm telling you, Uncle Ismail. I'm responsible. You're controlled by the devil now. I don't know what happened to you. Get to work, guys. If we stop, Borai will work immediately. His men are ready. And who was this made for? For women? Let's do it tonight. Don't lose everything with this madman. Not me, you want them to lose by staying sane. I'm a madman as you said. And all of them are madmen. But we should only be servile for God. We were humiliated. What did we gain? Be stationed on the pier and cripple the work. And if Borai and his men advance, make yourselves known to them. What can happen, will happen. -Let's go, guys. -Stop it, you guys. Listen to what I'm saying. There's no power but of God. My word is gold. And I do what I want. I'm very happy with you, you're a born foreman. Didn't I tell you? I told you that Ragab was a fine man. My office is open for you at any time. At this company or any other company. I like chivalry. But beware of Mamdouh. I don't care about people like him. I crush people like him between my teeth. The kind of people who only wanna chase girls and flirt with them using their eyes and smooth hair. And if he tries to stop me, this pocketknife will cut him. You're right to be angry with him. But now you should focus on the workers. Whatever, I won't let him go. I must kill him! I must kill him! Did you hear what Mr. Ragab said? You're the reason, who kills someone over work? It's all because of you. Ezzat will make Ragab lose his way. I must warn Mamdouh. You should care about your relative, your cousin. Who do you think I care about? I don't know. You're the one who can calm him down. But if you want to look at the high classes, then may God compensate me for you and for raising you. Whoever looks at the high social classes, their necks are bent. What happened to you? Wake up. Where are you going? Anywhere. Listen, girl. Hamedah. Come back, Hamedah. Wake up and come back, Hamedah. Come on, Monem. And if Ragab wants me, call me on my Yollanda Yacht. Good luck, champ. Thanks. Be happy. He is very happy with your deed. Where is Hamedah? Yes, my son. I'm asking about Hamedah. Where is Hamedah? I'll search for her, my son. She went out? She must've gone out. Maybe-- No, I know where she went. -She went to tell Mamdouh. -Ragab. -That's not important. -How do you know? She got worried about him. She went to tell him. It's okay. We will meet. Calm down and let’s drink two-- Ragab! Don't worry, chief. I'm with him. Please, son, look after him, he's a little bit upset. Of course, chief. See you later. See you later. -Good night. -Good night, madam. -Good night. -See you later. Good night. We were honored. Lady Nadia, Souad's party is on Saturday-- Bring their car, Abdu. Will Mamdouh come this time, Auntie? Apologies, he's busy these days. Since he became the manager, nobody has seen him. The manager! No, it's just-- Anyways, I'm-- -Answer that, Mamdouh. -Necessarily, Souad always asks about you. Be sure that next time I won't be late, Miss Souad. Anyways, congrats on the new job. Thanks a lot. We're very happy for you. Thanks a lot. Go to the back door. Mom. Mom. Was that the one who made you late for the party? Have you sunk that low? Come, come in. What brought you here? What's this on your face? Come and wash your face. Now's not the time for that. There's no time, you must understand. What's this? Grease? Grease or tar. Just listen. Just wait until I bring you-- Oh, God! Will you listen or should I go? At least clean your face. What's wrong? What happened? Ragab has lost his mind, he wants to hurt you, be careful. -What could he do to me? -What could he do? Don't underestimate him, Mr. Mamdouh. His pocketknife is always on him. And why does he want to kill me? I don't know, ask him. No, don't ask him. Please don't stand in his way tonight. Are you worried that he would kill me? -Would you be sad if I died? -Died? Oh, my God! It would be a calamity if Ragab killed you. If it was Ragab, a fever or falling from a window, what would be the difference? What do you mean? I mean you're worried about him, not about me. Say that. He has a good heart. But he becomes a madman when he gets upset. He will go to prison. Don't worry about him. Do you want a glass of lemonade? What lemonade? In his rage, he made the workers stop working. Is all of this because he saw you with me on the speedboat? I wish I hadn't got on it with you. He was furious at home. He talked to you about it at home! Some people were inciting him. That devious man, Ezzat, who you trust with everything. Ezzat? Did Ezzat go to Ragab at home? Yes. He pretended to be his friend and incited him. I'll hit him if I see him at the pier. What's this workers' matter? That devious Ezzat told Ragab that you didn't need Uncle Ismail and would assign work to Borai. The workers are gonna fight at the pier. Go and see for yourself. Thank you so much, girl. You rest here and I'll go and check it out. What? Rest where? I'm going home. Okay, but take care of yourself. Don't worry about me. I'm strong. You take care of yourself. Don't worry about Ragab. Everything can be fixed with one word. Unemployment is evil. If you had given him responsibilities, he wouldn't have met that bitch. "That bitch?" That bitch that you don't like, we owe her a lot. She came to warn us about a disaster that's about to happen. The trust you put in Ezzat has paid off eventually. What did Ezzat do? He destroyed everything while we were unaware. He made Uncle Ismail think that you didn't need him anymore. He made Borai think that he would replace him. And the result is that work has stopped, and the workers will revolt. Why did Ezzat do this? Wake up. Ezzat hates us and intends to bankrupt us. Call the police, do something. No, I must check this out by myself. Are you still gonna check it out? I must stop Ezzat now. Where are you going, Mamdouh? To the pier, how long can we stay asleep for? Be careful, Mamdouh. Call me once you get there. Call you! What's this? What's this? Get out. Get out. Get out. Oh, my God! What? You are a bully and a criminal. You're a bastard. Calm down. If I know for sure what's between them, I'll calm down. For three years, Ragab, he had her all for himself. -Monem. -Yes. What would happen if I stabbed him with a pocketknife? You'd be hanged. They would destroy you. He would deprive you of her while you... Whoever deprives me of her, I'll kill them. She's my relative. I raised her. She slept on this arm lots of times. That bastard tempted her with his talk. Women don't get tempted by talk. Maybe by gifts. Haven't you once seen a bracelet on her or an earring? A bracelet? An earring? No, I haven't. She must be hiding them from you. If she's hiding them, then there's something between them. Search and you'll find out. Search? Shame on you, Ragab. They fooled you. Dad, the workers aren't here, and the captain gave us a warning. Ezzat is the reason. I don't know yet. Ragab incited them. -Yeah. -Okay, see you later. Well done, Ragab. You too stand in my way. Okay then. -Ragab's mother? -Ragab, Mr. Fadel. Come in, what's up with him? Ragab returned today after traveling for three years. I haven't seen him for three years. Yeah, I saw him, but I didn't catch up to him to talk to him. I can't believe he's just returned. And I can't endure his absence again. Why? Does he intend to go travelling again? Travel? I wish. I'm worried about him going to prison. Prison? Why? Ragab insists on killing your son, Mamdouh. Killing Mamdouh? He must've lost his mind. Mamdouh? Don't you think about anyone but Mamdouh? What about Ragab? Don't you ever think about him? I've endured our mistake alone for 25 years. Shame on you. When are you going to stop being ashamed of him? Can't you be kind to him? He is your son as he is mine. Ragab is your son, he needs you. Isn't it enough that you left me alone? Lower your voice, please. Lower my voice? Are you afraid that the lady might hear? That fear of yours made you abandon your son for 25 years. But I can't see my son, my own flesh and blood, go to prison in front of my eyes. I'll do the impossible to fix this problem. Come, don't worry. But wait, you didn't tell me. What's the reason? Why does he want to kill him? Your son is greedy, Fadel. All this wealth isn't enough for him, so he desires Hamedah whom Ragab loves. Okay, I'll go down there and see him by myself. Keep Mamdouh away from Ragab. I'm telling you. Tonight we will remind Alexandria of Hamedo, Fares, Bendaa and Abu Khatwa. We will meet, Mr. Mamdouh. At your service. You're right on time. Ragab, don't be reckless. Try to stop me. I'm here by myself to reason with you. For what? We're not enemies. And we're not friends. I didn't do you wrong. Will you attack me as you attacked Hamedah and hit her? Can't you tell your friends from your enemies anymore? Ezzat fooled you and persuaded you to make the workers revolt. The workers' interests are my responsibility. The workers must continue their work or the police will intervene. Mr. Mamdouh is threatening you, guys. Run like rabbits. It's my fault. I should've talked to the man who appreciates responsibility. Where is Uncle Ismail, guys? Next to the fishing boat. I'll go to him. -Where are you going? Afraid to fight? -Business interests are more important. Come here. Where are you going? Come here, coward. Hello. What? What? This meeting must not happen. Move and strike now. Even if you have to kill one of them. Don't ask me how. Yeah, kill. Take the Jeep. If he hadn't had the car with him, they would've got his body from the morgue. He had enough, guys. Come on, guys. Don't argue. Go to your seats. Go on. And you, Ragab. Go home, so that you can have a look. As I told you, when you look, you find. Where are you going? You go home, none of your business. Give me my jacket. I was told I could find Uncle Ismail here. Where is he? He's praying right there. Uncle Ismail. Uncle Ismail. Uncle Ismail. Uncle Ismail. Uncle Ismail. Uncle Ismail. What happened, Gaber? -Mamdouh killed Uncle Ismail. -What are you saying? Mamdouh killed Uncle Ismail. Mamdouh. Here is Mamdouh's car. -He's the one who killed him. -Infidels. -Oppressors. -Let's go, guys. Go to bed, Auntie. You spent the whole night sitting in damp conditions. The sun is rising and Ragab hasn't come home yet, Hamedah. Ragab. My dear son. What's wrong? Are you hurt? It's nothing, Mom. Have you calmed down, Ragab? Yes, Mom. You go to bed. What's wrong? What's wrong, Ragab? Leave me alone and go away. Should I leave you bleeding? What's all this kindness? Save it to show it off in front of people. I don't care about people. Maybe someone you care about. I don't care about anyone. Maybe me. Of course, it's me, right? Did you give me a chance to show you that I care about you? Good girl. So you just didn't get a chance. If that weren’t the case, it would be me. Me, Ragab, not someone else. Do you hear what she's saying, Mom? She's telling the truth, my son. Really? So Hamedah loves me. It's clear from her sweet talk. I can't do sweet talk. Sweet talk is for the cinema. You know the cinema too! You've been. I've been. The girl in the cinema said to the boy she loves, "I wish I were a part of you, I wanna be inside your heart and soul." It's nonsense. But sweet. Ragab. Why are you irritable like this? People's actions make me angry. Bad people. You're like this. When someone talks to you, you either fight or joke. How do others talk? How would I know? Tell me. I don't know. It's love. You grew up and knew love. Like all people do. And do you love? Like all people do. Can I tell you who... and when? A long time ago, without anybody knowing. Really? And nobody notices me, as if I don't have a heart. Since when? I have a heart too. It's true, I don't show it, but my heart ached a lot. One year? Two years? Three? Three, right? When I was absent. Even before that. Every time I think, my heart beats so hard. Not a bad beating, but a very good beating. And when you were absent-- How long was it before that? Ragab. Behind my back too? What do you mean? Behind my back with the traitor who pretends to be my friend? No, Ragab. Never. You're wrong. Really! Behind my back. Did he buy you with this, slut? You're wrong, Ragab. I'm talking about you. About me? And what are these? What did you do for him to give them to you? And what was the price that you paid to him? He fooled you and told you that he loved you. People like him don't know love. Maybe he has lots of things to give you. But I'll give you love. Leave me alone! Is this what you want? You're drunk. I have nothing to give you but this. A long time ago, my gift was my hard work, health, and kindness. They didn't work with you. Maybe this will work. Get off me! Calm down, Ragab. She's a slut! A slut! Take these. Check these out. Check these out. A slut. A whore. I've been traveling for three years and dying from missing her. For three years, I never thought of anyone else but her. And the slut is fooling around with Mr. Mamdouh. Those mean cowards. They took advantage of my absence to have fun. And when I returned, wow, they smiled at me and hugged me. They fooled me! She showed me that she loved me. It was like a dream come true. I dreamed about it every night. When I was thinking about that slut. Why would she love me? I can't flirt with my eyes, and I can't dance. Good morning, madam. Would you like to dance? This is the tango. A small gift for you. No, watch out. My pants will rip. An earring, a necklace. And this Ragab, how could she feel that he has a heart? What would his gift be? Some clams? Some sand smelts? Or maybe a sugar doll! Isn't that all that he owns? This Ragab doesn't get loved. Do you understand? He doesn't get loved! Are you listening? A heartless human. He is a hard rock who doesn't have a heart. Why are you doing this to yourself, son? Do you love her that much? Yes, I love her. Is it inappropriate to love her? But the girl only loves you. Of course. And as proof of that, she betrayed me once I returned. She loves me to the extent of humiliation in front of Mamdouh and all the workers. The day I returned from traveling, she went out with him to paint the boat. She made all the workers talk about me. I can't look them in the eye. The whole pier is laughing at me! I'll kill her. I'll kill her. Ragab. Where are you going, Ragab? Are you drunk? Are you drunk, Ragab? No, Ragab. No! Uncle Ismail was killed. Ragab, what's all this? You go inside. His name is Ezzat Khalil, officer. He's the one responsible for everything, sir. Thanks. Did you send for Ragab or not? Leave him alone, Ragab. Let the water clean you, bastard. Ragab, he could drown. So what? Why are you doing this, my son? Mr. Ragab. You're needed at the office. The boss wants to see you. Tell him to get lost. Wait, he'll go to him. Go to him, my son. I'll go to him! Please go to him. Not for their sake, but for me. I beg you. And what do you have to do with all of this? May God guide you, my son. Go to him and you'll understand. It's a simple request, don't embarrass me. I beg you. Forgive me, God. You'll understand everything if you hear him out. And, my son, whatever happens between you two, don't forget that everything I did my whole life was for you. What's that noise? I don't know. Go and check it out. What's wrong? Uncle Ismail was killed. Mamdouh killed him. -That can't be. -People saw him. We're searching for him, and we will catch him. We will cut him into pieces, him and whomever stands in our way. Did you see him? No. Come, get in, fast. Where are you going? Just get in or they will see you. Stay with him, don't leave him alone. No. You stay here, Hamedah. -Or the man-- -Just get in, there's no time for this. Don't leave him alone, Hamedah. Don't worry. How can you guys think like that? Don't be reckless. Is that believable? This is madness. Make room, please. Come in, Ragab. Yes, sir. Ragab. There's an important matter I wanna talk to you about. I need you, Ragab. What a great honor! Ragab, you've never talked to me in this tone. What is up? I'm fed up with you, your son and your deeds. What do you want from me? Why did you send for me? Do I work for you? The way you treat your workers is enough. Ragab, stay a real man, as you always have been, and don't let anyone fool you. I won't get fooled. No, Ezzat has fooled you and the workers, and he will cause a revolt. And I've never thought to give work to anyone other than Ismail's men. Your words have no value now. Believe me, Ragab. Ezzat did all this for his own interests. -And above that... -What? If we had more time, I'd explain to you. Give it time, it's early in the morning. Mamdouh is in danger, and you must save him from it. Really? Oh, poor man! You must save him, Ragab. Should I be the one to save him? Why? Is he dear to me? Does he hold me dear? Is he my friend? More than a friend. Mamdouh is your brother. Of course, now we're all brothers, but only in times of need. No, Ragab. You have to believe me. Mamdouh is your brother. My brother? How come? Is this a new trick? It is the truth, Ragab. And I'm your dad. My dad? Yes. You're my dad, and you abandoned me for 25 years? I'll explain everything to you later. Were you ashamed of me for 25 years? Forgetting about me? Deleting me from your life? Let me explain to you, my son. Why didn't you say something? What did I do to you? You left me for 25 years to live in misery and poverty, me, and my moth... So my mother... Ragab. Ragab, please. Now you're begging me. Kneel! Ask for mercy from the one you've been cruel to. Mamdouh is in danger. Mamdouh is your brother. What's your kind? What are you made of? What do you have here? Is all this because your son is in danger? What about me? If I were in his place, would you care? Would you ask about me? You're worth nothing to me with all your power and wealth. I'm ashamed of you. I disown you! You're right. All the workers are searching for Mr. Mamdouh and want to kill him. Ragab. My son, did you hear? Mamdouh is in danger, save your brother. My brother? Don't disgust me. Guys, Hamedah helped Mamdouh escape on a boat out at sea. Come with me to catch them. We're almost at the dock. Once we arrive, take a company car and go home. And you? I'll return to make sure Ragab is okay. You love him. Anyways, thanks for your help. I'd give my eyes for you, Mr. Mamdouh. None of this was your fault. -Tell us where Mamdouh is, Ragab. -We'll cut him into pieces. -He betrayed him. -A coward. Declare the oneness of God, guys. There is no deity but God. He escaped. Ezzat caused discord among you by lying. The company is innocent, and the truth will prevail. Uncle Ismail's men will work. And will they resurrect Uncle Ismail? His blood won't be spilled in vain. There will be an investigation. But Mamdouh is innocent. What investigation? That will take a long time. Ragab betrayed you, guys. Turn, there they are. Look. Paddle towards the sailboat. Skipper! Skipper of the Tawakalt Ala Allah boat! Help us, skipper. Help us, please. Throw the rope. Take it, skipper. Give it to me. Mamdouh. You coward. Where will you escape to? Yeah, we must get him down here. We're under your protection, skipper. Don't worry, come here. We want that man, skipper. Go back, nobody comes near here. They are under my protection. What protection? He is a criminal, a killer. Go back, nobody violates the law of the sea. Go back. I'll get him down, make room. Can you call the police? Okay, I'll send Mourad for the police. -Mr. Mamdouh! -What? Who's that? Stop Ragab, he's fighting with your father and wants to kill him. That criminal, where? At the company, come with me. Stop or I'll hit you with this lantern. -Don't listen to him, Mr. Mamdouh. -Shut up, girl. You shut up, you harmful, devious man. Aren't you the one who came to Ragab at home? And the other bad man, Ezzat, was with you, and you both turned him on Mr. Mamdouh and his dad by lying. Please don't listen to him. They came to Ragab at home and talked to him. And now he wants to get you down there to the workers so that they kill you. Don't go down there, Mr. Mamdouh! You criminal. Watch out for the fire. Come here. Get Mr. Mamdouh. The fire will catch you, come here. Get Mr. Mamdouh. Mamdouh is burning! Let me go. Mamdouh is burning! The company bought the Winch, guys. Shut up, boy. I'm always a real man, and I don't betray my co-workers. You were on our side when you went into the company. And you were furious. Don't listen to him, guys. Ragab, Mamdouh is burning! Your brother is on the boat. Save your brother. Let me go! Ragab! Ragab! Ragab! Guys, Mamdouh is innocent. Monem is the killer. Ragab! -Ragab, Mamdouh is burning. Save him. -How is that possible? -Excuse me. -Yes. You're under arrest. Me? Why? Don't you know? Oh, I know. What a shame. Get to work, guys. The ship must be loaded today. Come on, guys, let's get to work. Hamedah. From now on, Mamdouh owes you his life. Me? Come with me. You must complete your favor and give me a chance to return it to you. Well done, Winch. Well done. Come with me. Come with me. Wait. We will be right behind you. Hassan! -Well done, Ragab. -Well done, Winch. Wait for me there. You saved him. That was true chivalry. Ragab. Come. -Where to? -I want a word with you. What can I say, my son? Come with me. From now on, you have a home and a father. You'll live with us forever, Ragab. Ragab. Answer me. I'm an old man now, and I live with regret, Ragab. Forgive me. Who am I to forgive you? Only God forgives. How could God forgive me if my own son won't forgive me? You're my son, Ragab. Did you tell anyone that? Did you tell Mamdouh? I'll tell everyone. You won't tell anyone. I'd rather be fatherless than let people know that my mother... Ragab, where are you going? The ship I returned onboard is departing now. I'll travel my whole life. And will you leave your father? My father died. Hamedah. What are you doing here, Hamedah? Hamedah is one of us now, Mamdouh. I chose her for you. I wish. But her heart has already chosen. Go to Ragab, Hamedah. You love him. And you are all he has. As you wish, my son. Ragab. Answer me, my son. Shame on you, Ragab. I have nobody but you in this life. I couldn't believe that you'd finally returned, Ragab. Will you leave me and go traveling again? I'm living for you, Ragab. Who else would I live for? I'm your mom, Ragab. I can't, Mom. Forgive me, Mom. Ragab. Are you returning with us? My poor son. Will I live to see you again? AMBULANCE Hamedah. Hamedah. Ragab is going to go traveling. What are you doing here? Hassan! Come on, go after him. But clean yourself up. Hassan! Drive her to the pier fast. I hope she catches up to him. Ragab! Ragab! Ragab! Ragab! Ragab! Ragab! Ragab! Ragab! Ragab! Come back, Ragab! Come back! Ragab! Come back! I won't do it again, Ragab! I swear I won't do it again, Ragab! THE END Subtitle translation by Kamel Samir
