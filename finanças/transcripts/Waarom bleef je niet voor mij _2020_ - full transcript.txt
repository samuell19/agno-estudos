WHY DIDN'T YOU STAY FOR ME? It was suicide. Suicide, that was it. Mom jumped in front of a train. I can hardly believe it. Bye. I’m afraid I’m the only one. Ten years later, I meet you guys. You're making the same journey I'm going to ask you the questions Dad hanged himself as hangman. Like that game. I found that weird, I said that to my mom and she said: 'It's not that funny in real life, because then you don't have a dad anymore.' He put a bag over his head, so the gas stayed near his head. And because of the garden hoses connected to two helium tanks... ...he inhaled enough helium to fall asleep and then he passed away. He took a lot of pills, He had come up with a step-by-step plan. At first he wanted to cut his wrists, but it didn't go deep enough. He had a rope to hang himself, He had something else. Then he wanted to use the rope... ...but he died of those pills before he had a chance to use it. He hanged himself. In the hallway. I used to be daddy's girl. But now I'm mommy's girl, Do you know anyone else No, just you. Who do you talk to Just to my mom, actually. And other than that to no one. Does anyone know how it happened No, no one. For a long time I thought I was the only one. Were there things you didn't want to know about how your dad died? No, not really. I didn't want to know yet, FOREST OF ANGER I don't want people I don’t want them to think Are you angry? Yes, I was angry for a long time because he did that, but... ...when you can't be happy anymore... ...I probably would have done When dad stopped living, ...because he could have just talked But I also thought he was courageous, because he dared to stop living. What would you have preferred him to do? Gotten help. Even if... ...that help wouldn't have worked... ...I'd be a lot less angry. When you have a child... ...it's difficult for that child when that person isn't there anymore. That child might get depressed and might not want to live anymore either. That child should have a nice life too. You shouldn't ruin it for that child. Do you think your dad ruined your chance of having a nice life? Yeah, a little bit. I've never been angry at my dad I'm actually glad he did it, because now he doesn't suffer anymore. He would never have been happy. So it's better that he isn't suffering anymore. WATERFALL OF TEARS Did you notice anything I'd been noticing for a while... ...that he was sad or angry sometimes. But I didn't know why. I knew that he was ill. But that's all I was told, Later on I was told Sometimes I knew for a little bit that he didn't want to live anymore... ...because he didn't feel comfortable in his own skin and so on. I thought: 'He's just having a bad day.' But that wasn't true. It was like that for him every day. When you have the worrying disease, you can't think straight, you get tired. At some point, you don't want to breathe anymore. When you don't breathe, you die. Sometimes I think: Then I have weird thoughts about myself, even though that isn't necessary. My dad probably wanted to protect me from what was going through his mind. That's probably why he chose to leave. What are you afraid of? For instance, that he didn't love me enough, or that it was my fault. Why do you think your dad did it? I have no idea. It's more like... It was so bad that nothing was able to make him happy anymore. So, yeah. We weren't able to either. I keep thinking: I was able to cry, I could if I would, I don't want mom to cry. That way she doesn't have to cry. When I cry, That's why I hardly ever cry, or I go and cry by myself somewhere. In a corner. I've cried enough. MOUNTAINS OF CONCERN Because dad died... ...I've become more afraid that something will happen to mom. That she'll die as well, and that I'll have to manage on my own. Sometimes I'm worried... ...that something will happen to mom, because I have only one parent left. I kept thinking about the fact... ...that my dad had died. I was afraid my mom would die as well. I feel afraid when I sleep in my own room. When I sleep here, So then I can sleep in peace, because I see my mom next to me. Then I know everything is fine. I want to be up a bit. You go to sleep and I'm going Like always. Oh, no. OK, nighty night, honey. What if you have an accident? I won't have any parents I worry about that. When I'm at after-school care, you call when I can come home. What if you call an hour later? Then I'm afraid that something Come here, honey. Oh, sweetie. My sweetheart. MIRROR LAKE I don't trust my own sadness. Is it normal sadness? I wondered whether the sadness The sadness kept returning. I was afraid of doing the same thing. I was afraid of persuading myself to commit suicide as well. I was very afraid of that. Sometimes I wonder whether this is the beginning of the worrying disease... ...or am I just worried? Do you want to be like your dad Yes. He's my role model. In what way are you like your dad? - That I can pretend to be happy... ...even when I don't feel so good inside. A lot of people say that up to here I'm like my dad and the rest is like my mom. We have a neighbor who looks like him. So, for instance, when I look out of the window and I see the neighbor... ...I think: 'Huh? Is that dad? Sometimes I think: 'Hey, he looks like dad.' Because he has the same hairdo... ...and exactly the same hair color. But when I look at his face, Then I think: Huh? He really looked like dad. Then my heart beats very fast But then I think: No, it isn't possible, it isn't dad. NEST OF MEMORIES My dad found this. My dad found this too. A Roman jar. I also have this round stone. Completely round. This snorkel was my dad's. I was allowed to snorkel with it too, but eventually it cracked. I still love her, Dad's ashes were scattered in the dunes. We didn't go back there after that. Mimi. When I go there, UNKNOWN TERRITORY OK, here you go. We’ll just try to sleep here, right? Kiss. Hug. I really want to sleep in my own room again. Then I can have sleepovers ...without worrying. Go to sleep. Nighty night. Sweet dreams. Just like you guys, I often felt lonely. But we're making the same journey. I don’t know what’s ahead of us. But we just keep going. A step each day. How often have you been expelled? - Never. Nada. Not even once. And I've never had a failing mark. I'm so proud. Thank you. We have priority, madam. Sorry, madam. Special thanks to all the brave children ...for sharing their stories
