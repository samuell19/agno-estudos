found some. - Thanks. - When's your appointment? Uh, not until 12 o'clock. Oh! You've got a few minutes. You're sure you don't want me coming with you? Don't worry about it. I don't have to meet my next client until 2:15. It's okay. Mike said he would try to make it. Okay, so where is he? Have you even told him, bren? He said he would try to make it, Meg. Okay. I should probably get going. Are you sure you don't want me there? I'm sure. It's probably just a follow-up appointment anyway. Right. Ms. Lee? Brenda? I know this prognosis can seem daunting to say the least. There are resources here at the hospital available to you Throughout treatment. Now aside from the breast cancer diagnosis, You also carry the brca1 gene mutation, Which could be passed down to any children Should you have any. So if you do, let them know So they can be tested as soon as possible. How... How long? this is not a guarantee, But based upon cases I've seen similar to yours, If you were to do nothing, the odds of you surviving this Are slim. Nine months. Maybe ten. This is an aggressive form of cancer, And what I recommend as soon as possible is surgery, Chemo and radiation. Oh, shoot. Are you just now returning from lunch? I'm sorry, my appointments took longer than I thought they wo... That's the second time this week you've had an appointment Take longer than you thought it would. Yeah, I'm sorry. I'll-I'll make up the-the time. Yes, you will. Bren, what happened? are you okay? no. Is it... Yes. - I'm coming over. - No. No, no, I'm fine. No, you're not fine. I am, I really... I'm okay. mike's here. How'd he take it? Hey. Hey. It'll be all right. We're gonna get through this, okay? Okay, bren? okay. And listen, I-I don't care what time it is, If you ever need anything, you let me know, yeah? Meg, there... There is something I need To a... Ask you for. Of course. What is it? I need you to help me find someone. Who? these overnight shifts are killing me. maybe a cushy office job like yours Would be better on my back. Well, sitting all day isn't good for you, either. Yeah? Well, neither is standing. How did your, um, thing go yesterday? Uh, the dentist appointment? It was a doctor's appointment. right. How'd that go? I have to get ready for work. Hey. Hey, guys. Not gonna get any views if you don't have Anything to say, Talia. Great! Thanks for the insight, Tobias. Yeah. Yeah, sure. Talia, remind me again why you dated Tobias? I think most everyone here would agree That drywall has a more interesting personality. You'll never let me live that down, will you? - Sorry, no. - We had a lot in common. And then he stole your idea. I mean, do the editors really think an in-depth piece About body positivity came from that brain? Look at him. Did you see how many hits it's gotten so far? Mm, don't remind me. The worst part is all the big bosses Have been singing his praises ever since. Whatever weird alternate dimension we're in, I want out. look, I just need to come up with a concept he can't Steal, then everyone will see him for what he really is. A trust-fund baby with major daddy issues And an obsession with obnoxiously printed shirts? - A fraud, Morgan. - Right. That, too. Look, he's gonna get what's coming to him, okay? I'm a big believer in karma. You know, we should be kind to ourselves right now. Okay. Are you serious? Oh, come on! Hey. Can I help you? - Talia Carroll? - Yeah. I'm... Brenda lee. Your birth mother. Uh, uh... Can we talk inside? How did you find me? My friend, she, she helped me. She's a social worker. I-I-I found you months ago, but I... I-I-I have something important to tell you. Can, can we talk inside? Why would I let you inside my home? I don't even know who you are. Wait! Talia, please. what? Five minutes. triple-negative. Never even heard of that. me neither. Apparently, it's not very good. Well, I mean, no cancer is, but... You know what I mean. So what's your plan? - Plan? - Yeah, like, what now? Chemo? Radiation? Herbal teas? Uh, well, uh, Possibly a-a mastectomy. Why possibly? Well, my doctor and I are discussing all the options. What other options are there? Well, that's pretty much the only one at the moment. Seems pretty simple then, either get the surgery or don't. Well, there are a lot of moving parts to this. But you're getting it done, right? Yeah. Definitely. Yeah. So... So, um, the reason that I'm here Is because, uh, the, um, Gene mutation that I have, the one that causes the cancer, It could possibly be... Hereditary. And I, I thought I should let you know, So that you could get yourself checked out. I thought it was... I-I thought it was a good idea to tell you in person. Okay, well, thanks for going through all this trouble To find me just to tell me that I could have cancer. Thanks a lot. I'm sorry. no, I'm sorry. This is a little much, I mean, it's not exactly How I pictured our first meeting. Tell me about it. I gotta go grab that real quick. Um, make yourself at home, I guess. - hey, mom! - Tal. Okay, where are you? Is the traffic really bad or something? Oh, my god, I'm so sorry. I totally blanked about dinner. that seems a little odd, concerning We texted about it this morning. I know, I know. I'm sorry. I got distracted by work. Um, a new feature I'm writing. Okay, well, you know what, I'm gonna wrap you up a plate. - And I can be there in 30. - No! I mean, ha-ha, that deli where you accidentally Knocked the waitress over is just up the street. I'll go grab something from there, unless you wanna join me. oh, my god, no, that's the last thing I wanna do. I'm never going back there again, That was so embarrassing. - I was absolutely mortified. - Me, too. knocking over all those plates, that poor girl. Uh, yeah, sorry, mom. I-I gotta go. Tal? Hang on one sec. - Sorry about that. - I should really get going. Uh, thank you so much for letting me inside. You have a lovely home. Can't take all the credit. Well, my parents helped. They insisted, there's no way I could afford this On my peasant salary. That's good to know. Wait. Wait. So, do you wanna, maybe, exchange numbers or something? Oh. Sure. Okay. Okay. Great. Um, give me your phone and I'll-I'll put myself in. Oh, um... There. - Can I ask you something? - Sure. I don't really know how to say this without sounding weird, But how much time do you have left? Oh. Uh, well... I, uh, don't really know. Your doctor couldn't give you a time frame or anything? I can't imagine how that must feel. So what are you gonna do? What's your plan outside of treatment? W-well, the last three months was just about Building up the courage to come knocking on your door Once I found you. But now that that's done, I... I don't know. What else is there? Well, why don't we start with dinner tomorrow? You wanna go to dinner, with me? Yeah. I mean, unless you're busy or something. Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no. - I-I mean, no, I-I'm not busy. - Oh, okay, great. Whe-where do you wanna go? Uh, I usually grab a-a-a burger At, at burger hut or-or-or a sandwich at Gerry's. - Those are good and fast. - Okay, those are options. But what about something different? Something new? Like, what? Chez marcel's? It's a nicer place, on Johnson street. Do you know it? Tomorrow, six-ish? - Why not? - Okay. - See you tomorrow then. Okay. - Okay. so what's she like, this shiny new mom of yours? She seems... Reserved. A little uneasy. But I mean, I was feeling the same way, too. It's just so weird, seeing her in the flesh, Standing in front of me. And it makes perfect sense. This is kind of major for both of you. Totally. You know, it's funny. When I asked her what her plan was for the whole cancer thing, She didn't seem to have one, she said she wanted to find me To tell me about the gene, and that was it. So she's got nothing? No back-up plan? - No trick plays? - Nope. - No hail Marys? - Nada. Like, not even a bucket list. Talia Carroll, there it is. There what is? The article that's gonna kick Tobias' idea-stealing ass Three ways from Sunday. A breast-cancer bucket list. I don't know, Morgan. Doesn't that seem a little exploitative? - No. - Okay, maybe not to you. But to, like, to a normal person. uh, Tal, listen, readers know a heartfelt story When they read it, and what I'm seeing Is a young woman reconnecting with her dying birth mother, Helping her live the rest of her life to the fullest. Someone give this woman her Pulitzer, stat! It just seems in bad taste. But this is your story, from your perspective, no one else's. How-how is that in bad taste? You are not gonna mess this up. Tal, this is it. This is your story. Do you have a reservation? Uh, um, yeah. I-I think for two, Under Talia Carroll. There. Gotcha. Right this way. Brenda! Hey! - Hi. - Hey. Oh? Sorry I'm late. Work is nuts. No, don't worry about it. So excited! - How's it goin'? - Good. I will give you two a few minutes to look over the menu. - Um, are you ready? - Uh, uh, sure. Okay, um, I will start with a Caesar salad, Then I'll have the steak, medium rare, With roasted potatoes on the side. Excellent choice. How about you? Uh, uh, the house salad, please. - All right. - What? No, no, no, Brenda. - Order whatever you want. - Are you sure? Yes! Look, if you want the 32 ounce porterhouse, go for it. um... I'll just have what she's having. Sounds good. It'll be right out. Thank you. Mm... - Thank you. - Mm-hmm. So who do you have supporting you during all this? A partner, siblings, other family? Well, there's my friend, Meg. Uh, she and I have known each other forever. It's nice to have someone in your life like that. - Mm-hmm. - Where'd you guys meet? At school. Uh, she was studying to be a social worker And, um, and I was taking art history. We met up in a liberal arts class. We just hit it off. Twenty years later, she's working for the state And I'm, uh, in data entry. Is Meg all you have? Well, there's mike, but... Is mike your husband? Uh, no. No, no, no. Uh... We've been together for a long time, but... I don't wanna bore you with the details. No. No, you're not boring me at all. I mean, I wanna hear everything. I wanna know about you, I wanna know about my, um, your family. Like, were you born here? Have you always lived in the city? I immigrated with my parents from Beijing About 35 years ago, And I've never really lived anywhere else. I've never really traveled anywhere else either. Um, are your parents Still around? They passed away when I was 11. I'm so sorry. Hav... Did you have someone to take care of you after that? Just myself. My... I was in foster care until I was 18. Start you two off with some bread. Main courses will be right out. - Thank you. - Yeah. Is my dad around? His family Wouldn't let him get involved. They said that, uh, having a child out of wedlock Would be a stain on their family's reputation. So he had to choose either them or me. I was young and terrified And... All alone. I didn't wanna drag you into all of that, So I, I did what I thought was best for both of us. Was it? I've been really lucky. Um, I love my job, I may even be able to pay off My student loans in the next 40 years or so. w-w-what do you do? Um, I work at repeat media. It's a website that covers news and culture. - I'm a writer. - Oh, a writer? - Well, that sounds fun. - Yeah. It is. Um, I work in the lifestyle department, So I get to tackle articles on political issues And city issues and feminist issues. I've got a lot of issues, apparently. And, uh, your parents... Are they good to you? Yeah. They're really good people. They adopted me when I was only a few months old. I never felt like I wasn't their daughter. Let me show you. Okay. we were being kinda silly. Yeah. How did they tell you about the whole adoption thing? Um... They were always pretty open about it. If I ever asked a question, they would answer as honestly As they could, plus, it was kind of obvious That I was adopted. I mean, we don't exactly look alike. so... All right. Two steaks, medium rare. Can I get you ladies anything else? Um, I think we're good. Thank you. - Enjoy. - Thanks. That's all you get for all that money? It's no wonder I've never eaten here. so yesterday you mentioned not having Much of a plan during all this. Is there anything that you've always wanted to try, But have never been able to do? Like, like skydiving Or dog-sledding or bungee jumping? Things like that? Uh, no, I've never really thought about it. What do you think about... A bucket list? Excuse me? Haven't you always wanted to Make one, to do all the things That you've always wanted to do, But were too afraid to try? I, I don't know. Yes! It'll be fun, I promise. I-I could help you. I mean, we could do it together. I-I don't want to interfere more than I already... No, no, you're not interfering, you're not interfering. Um, okay, what is the one thing in life That you've always wanted to do, but have never had the chance? uh, uh... I don't know, maybe, um... Uh, not have to worry about money. Okay, um, number one, withdraw my savings account. I don't know about that. I mean, go big or go home, right? Well, if I spend all my money, I wouldn't have a home. - Oh. Sorry. - that's okay. Okay.

Yeah, like, I should've said something, right? I should've fought. Instead, I just let him do it. I'm not gonna let him do it again. - Screw you, Tobias! - Oh, my gosh. Here, here, try it, try it, try it. Uh... Uh, I-I-I'm sorry, I don't think I can do this. No, you can, you can, okay? Just forget about everything you're afraid of. Focus on the moment. Live for now.

No one is going to walk all over me. no one is going to walk all over me. No one is going to walk all over me. No one is going to walk all over me! - Not anymore! - Yeah! say it! Say it! Say it! Say it! Say it! Say it! Say it! Say it! Say it! screw you, Kevin! ♪ I'm so in love with me ♪ Screw you, Kevin! ♪ I'm so in love with me ♪ ♪ so so so so in love with me ♪ ♪ I'm so so so so in love with me ♪ We got to go! Abort the mission! ♪ I'm so I'm so in love with me ♪ Where's the beer? I... Oh, I, I was, uh, running errands. - I forgot. I'm sorry. - Oh, god. what, again? You know, you've been conveniently Forgetting a lot recently. Where are my photo albums? I don't know. I-I left them right here on this table. - You must've moved them. - I didn't! - They were right here! - I don't know! I guess they disappeared after I took the initiative To clean up around here, so we don't live in a pigsty, bren. I'm-I'm sorry, I've just been so bus... No one's gonna walk all over me. I'm dying, mike. What are you talking about, bren? I have breast cancer. That, that's not funny. It's not a joke. Look at me. look at me. Don't you notice anything different? This didn't just happen overnight, you know? what? When, when did you find out? A few months ago. And you never bothered to tell me? Oh, my god, Brenda. Brenda, what's the matter with you? - Excuse me? - You should've told me. I could've, we-we could've done something. - Like, what? - I don't know! Something! Well, it's a little too late for that now. Well, how long? I don't know, months, maybe. Well, how could you do this to me? - To you? - What, all those... What, all those mammogram reminders from your doctor That you just tossed in the trash? If only you had gone! They could've caught it sooner. You know what, this all could've been avoided If you weren't so selfish, so stubborn, so bull-headed! If I would've known about this earlier, This would all be different. You know what? You're right. This is all your fault. Yeah. You might've made me go and get tested And the doctors might've found it sooner. Maybe early enough to save my life, even. But I still wouldn't have been happy. And I haven't been happy, mike. I haven't been happy for a very long time. And I would've been stuck in this one-way relationship, At this dead-end job, paying for this house, Because you keep getting fired from every single job! And I would have continued living exactly as I always have, Without purpose! But not anymore. Not with so little time left. Bren, wait. Wait, just, just, just, stop, stop, stop! Be rational for a minute, bren! No! You stop! I am being rational. I have never thought more clearly In my entire life. Oh. can I come in? Yeah. Come on in, Brenda. Have a seat. I'm glad you came by, actually. I've been looking over your personnel records For the last several years that you've been with the company. And during that time, you have hardly taken any sick days, Your work's never been late And you've always been prompt. That was up until a few months ago. So tell me, Brenda, what's changed? The world will keep on spinning long after I'm gone. Excuse me? A lot has changed, Kevin. I realized in the last couple of months That I need to be more proactive in my life... I need to make changes, And that I have the capacity To make those changes. Life is just a bunch of little moments All wrapped up together. And when I look back at those moments for the last time... I don't wanna think about all the time that I wasted here. I'm sorry? Thanks for everything, Kevin. I quit. You know, you're really not all that bad of a guy. We probably could've been friends If you weren't such a jerk. Oh. And, uh, sorry about the tp. Wait. The tp? an-and-and I just walked right out of there. I didn't even look back. It was like This wave of energy washed over me, And-and I just felt so, well, For lack of a better word, alive! Are you sure that was a right decision? Oh, I have enough savings to last me for a while. Wow! Ha-ha. That does not sound like something you would say. The Brenda I know is work, work, work, no play. Well, maybe this is the new Brenda. You know, I, ever since I found Talia, I just, I see things from a different perspective. - How's that going? - Oh. Mm! It's going amazing, Meg. Yeah, and we-we started this bucket list, And ever since then every day is getting better and better. I'm doing things that I never thought I would before. And some of the things I do by myself, But most of the things I ask her to come with me. And it just feels so right. Bren, you know I love you. You know I'd do anything for you. But this whole thing with Talia, I mean, don't you think it's too much too soon? - What do you mean? - Well, look. You just came into her life, which is great. You're spending all this time together, which is also great. But think about it, bren, what's going to happen when... If you're gone? She's lost you once before. How do you think she'll handle losing you again? That's why I decided to get the treatment. What? I called Dr. Boyer and we are planning it As soon as possible. And was this all because of Talia? I realized I have something to live for. Come here! Come here! Okay, okay, okay, okay! Okay. Viva! Viva! - Viva! - La vida! - La vida! - Salut! - Todo. - All of it? - Oh, jeez, okay. - Todo. - Mm! - Ah! oh, yeah. okay, okay. - Hey, dad. - hey, kiddo. Just calling to see if you can make supper tonight. Sorry, no. I've got some major deadlines I need to hit. who knew writing personal essays Could be so stressful? Hey, um, listen. Is everything good with you these days? - Yeah. Why are you asking? - well... Don't tell her I said anything, but your mom Is pretty worried about you. Like, normal, you know, you haven't made a family dinner In months, you're working all the time. You don't even come by to steal toilet paper anymore. I am running low, now that you mention it. - we got plenty. Just... - um, I gotta go. But I promise I will make this up to the both of you. Next week. Pizza. My treat. Okay, but seriously, call your mother. All right? And, uh, looking forward to pizza. - talk soon, sweetie. - Okay. Goodnight. Hey! I thought we would try Something special. Oh, making! - It's a surprise! - Okay. The jiaozi fen, the dumpling flour makes it So that the dough doesn't stick. Mm. Jiaozi fen. - Jiaozi fen. - Jiaozi fen. perfect. - Okay. All right! - Okay. Teach me how to do this. - Okay. So you take the dough. - Okay. And then I press it in my palms, Make it flat. There we go, okay. And then I hold it with my left hand, And with the right hand I'm gonna roll the pin Like that, okay? - You got this? - I got... Yes. - Okay. You try. - Okay. - Okay! - There we go. Okay... If I turn it in. Okay, I got this. I can... I don't know how I'm gonna work this. Okay. I don't got this. Okay, here, let me help you salvage this. So just, there we go, put some pressure on the edges like that. - Okay. Okay. - Just push a little harder. Okay. Here we go. okay, maybe not so hard. that's so ugly! I'm just gonna let you do it. - Look, I can salvage this. - Yes. - Just... - There we go. Okay. I got it. I got this. There we go. well... Where'd you learn how to make these? I used to do this every Chinese new year with my mother. Yeah, she always complained that I stuffed it With too much filling. Uh, there's no such thing as too much filling. Oh. Exactly. Gosh, I haven't done this in forever. But it's like riding a bike, you know, you never forget. when was the last time? Not since she died. Then I tried to do it after the fact, but... It was just too much. I couldn't do it. That must've been hard, losing them both. How did it happen? We used to go boating Every summer on sterling lake. and when we'd get to the point Where we couldn't see land anymore... My father would cut the engine And drop the anchor And just let us drift. I still remember, on windier days, The boat would rock... And it was so easy to just... Fall asleep. On that day... I decided to go into the water while my parents were resting. And I got far way from the boat... When I heard the engine... From the other boat. And I turned around just in time to see the impact... are you okay? I just... I lost my breath for a second. I'm sorry you had to go through that alone... And that you grew up without a family. I used to think about you a lot. Like, who you were, If I had your eyes or your smile... Why you gave me away... You know, when you first showed up at my door, I was anxious. I remember thinking, like, "why here? Why now? Why, after 23 years, did you decide to barge into my life Like you belonged there from the start?" I mean, I had a great childhood. I have parents who love me. I didn't think I would ever need to have you around. But now... I don't remember what life was like without you in it. I am so sorry. I've never been more sorry for anything in my entire life. I know. I know. It's okay. hey, Tal? - hey, honey, we're here! - oh, my god! Oh, my god! Okay. Okay. Ah... Mom! Dad! What are you guys doing here? - We brought dinner. - Are you cooking? 'cause it smells delicious. - Who's your friend? - Um... Um, let's talk in my room for a quick sec, yeah? Dad, can you put the food on the table, please? Sure. Yeah. Plenty for everybody. Um... Okay. Mom? Wait. What are you doing here? - I should get going. - No, no, no, no. You don't have to go anywhere. Don't have to go anywhere. Okay? We, we were just making dumplings. Like, what does it matter? What does it matter? I mean, you lied to us. And on top of that, your birth mother Is standing in your house? Uh, when were you going to tell us that you found her? Well, she found me. She's, she's sick. She has cancer. Look, I'm sorry that you're unwell, But, um, can you just please tell me How the hell you found my daughter? okay... My friend, she's a social worker. Are you kidding? Oh, wow, that is so reassuring! You know, maybe you can get me her name so I can go to her home And thank her. I'll just show up unannounced. Better yet, why don't I just call her supervisor? What do... Look, nobody needs to get in trouble here. Yeah, everybody, let's just take a minute. - Let's take a breath... - I'm not gonna take a breath! Mom, can you please relax? She had every right to find me... - Given the circumstances. - Uh, you lied! Because I knew you'd react exactly How you are right now, okay? Yes, but the article you're writing, is that a lie, too? No. That, that wasn't a lie, okay? I have been struggling ever since Tobias stole my idea. And so when Brenda showed up, I-I had to explore it. And I've been writing about her, About the bucket list her and I created, About how I could have the same Cancer-causing gene mutation that she has. Okay, back up. Gene mutation? What are you talking about? - Talia... - Uh... All this time we spent together Was just content for your article? No. No, no, no. That's not, that's not what I meant. That's... Brenda? Are you okay? Brenda? oh, my god! Brenda? Oh, my god. Brenda? Mom, dad, call 911. What is taking so long? Where is the doctor? Honey, I'm sure Brenda's gonna be fine, okay? These things, they just take time. Talia, you mentioned earlier Something about the cancer being... - Hereditary. - Yes. That's why she came to find me, To tell me that I could have the same gene mutation, That I should get tested. And have you? no. Oh, Tal. you have to go get tested. This isn't something that you can just flake on Or sweep under the rug. You really have to, like, just... Mom! What? What have I done wrong now? I'm sorry that I haven't got tested. I'm sorry that I lied. I'm sorry that Brenda's fighting for her life Somewhere in this building while we sit here arguing. You know, this is taking too long. I'm gonna find a doctor. Talia, don't... Just... Hm... likely fainted due to stress, the toll That the cancer's taking on your body. Were you experiencing lightheadedness all day? it's been on and off for the last Couple of weeks now, but nothing like today. I see. So... We ran some tests To see where your body's at, and... The cancer is progressing, Brenda. We need to act now before we can't do anything at all. How soon? Tomorrow. I, I know things are moving fast, But if we don't have surgery or start treatment tomorrow, It's the difference between life and death at this point. You have to try. - Okay. - good. - Okay. - Good. Now you rest up. Tomorrow's gonna be a big day. Tal, it's okay. I'm really sorry. For what? For not telling you about her... And for everything. Yeah, well, I'm the one who should be apologizing. I don't know. Just when I saw her, it felt like She was trying to take you away from us. That would never happen. You're my mom. Mm... what is it? I just don't want her to leave me again. Like, the way that I feel when I'm with her, yeah, It's the same way that I feel when I'm with you Or with dad. You know, Nothing is ever going to change between us And how we feel for you. No. Hey, kiddo. You'll always be our daughter. Listen, I will always be your mother and Brenda... Brenda will always be your birth mother. We'll just have to set an extra plate for the holidays. Yeah. I love you, guys. Thank you. - Have a good day. Yeah. - Thank you. - Good morning! - hi. How can I help you? Can I get a pass to Brenda lee's room, please? Brenda lee? - L-e-e? - Yes, that's correct. Mm, sorry, but it looks like that patient Was released earlier this morning. Wait, what? Are you, are you sure? Dr, Boyer, did you release Brenda lee this morning? - She released herself. - But isn't her surgery today? - She canceled it. - Wait, what? - She canceled it. - That doesn't make any sense. Why would she do that? In the short time that I've known Ms. Lee, She never said anything more than she needed to say. I assumed it was her way of processing the diagnosis. I have seen this with other patients. They wait until the last possible moment, Thinking they'll be the ones to cheat fate. Seldom works out that way. No, no, but she was saying that, like... I tried to get her to commit. I really did. I thought today was the day, and I thought seeing you here Would help convince her that surgery was the right way Forward, but when I went to her room this morning to prep, She was fully dressed. She said she didn't wanna go through with it. Why? She said that she had nothing left to live for. paging Dr. Boyer to emergency. Dr. Boyer. we are out of options and we're out of time. When you see your mother again, please tell her that. - Hey. - How are you feeling? Better. You don't have to say that. You're not better. And you're not going to get any better Unless you get the surgery. I mean it, bren. Look, nobody asks to be put in a situation like this. Nobody wants surgery or months of chemo, To lose their hair when the outcome isn't a guarantee. But if there is a chance, even the smallest sliver, That you could come out alive, wouldn't you wanna try? I just don't see the point anymore, Meg. I have nothing left. Maybe if you hear it from someone else, then. Why didn't you tell me that you were the one Putting off your surgery? This whole time I thought you had exhausted every option, But you hadn't bothered to do anything? - H-how did you know that? - I was at the hospital. I stood outside your door. I heard everything. - You wouldn't understand. - Try me. Look, I am exhausted. You need to leave. No. I'm not leaving. You owe me an explanation. - An explanation? - Yes. Why did you leave the hospital? Why did you skip out on your surgery? Why do you want to die? Look, I have better things to do with my time. Better than calling your daughter and telling her you'r... More important things than calling the daughter Who was just using me for source material. That's not true. Your story only has one ending, Talia, And now that that's in sight, You don't have to dig for content anymore. - You don't mean that. - Your story's over, Talia. You can go. All I ever wanted was to know you. I'm glad I gave you up. Why? Because if I hadn't, You would never have lived up to your fullest potential. I would've ruined you, just like I ruined myself. That's not true. You have a good life. I mean, you can still have a good life. There's so much more to do. We could do it together. I am not gonna let you sit here and watch me die, Talia. Do you understand? You need to go. - No. - Now! Go! Get out of here! Go! Mm... - Here. - Thank you. You know, I've known Brenda for a, a really long time. She's always been this quiet, Reserved woman, Capable of so much more than what she has. The thing with Brenda is that she feels like She doesn't deserve anything better Because she's worked hard her whole life And hasn't had a break. She kind of lets everyone use her like a doormat, And accepts that as how it should be. She's never seen how it could be. I don't understand. These past few months, they've been amazing. I've only ever seen her happy. Never once did it seem like she wanted to die. Well, look, Brenda is a master at bottling her emotions. You know, I think she, she had to turn them off to survive After her parents died. Right. Her parents. But ever since you've been in her life, Something's changed. There is a, a spark, a-a flame. It-it wants to ignite, but it needs a match to light it. You are that match, Talia. You need to keep pushing her. You need to show her that life, it's worth living. Where are we going? You'll see. - Hey. - hm? we're here. Uh... it's beautiful. yeah, we used to come here when I was a kid. Haven't been back in years. Everyone's always too busy. Wait, is, is that a... No. Number six, get back into the water. - Talia, I can't, I can't. - Of course you can. - I can't do this. Please don't... - you can't or you won't? I know it's scary. I know it feels like your chest is caving in And the air's getting sucked out of your lungs. But you are not alone here. Okay? Not anymore. Let's do this together, okay? Just you and me. Come on. You okay? Come on. So, how long do you really have? I don't know. Maybe months. And why do you want to die? This... This life just... Wasn't what I pictured for myself. I just thought I would be someone Of more value... Someone with a purpose. Not just a 40-year-old woman with a bank account. I've just been coasting along, A ghost in my own story. What about me? You were never supposed to be part of this. I just wanted to warn you about the gene mutation, So, so that you could do something about it Before I could. But you can do something about it, and you should. Look, I heard the doctor say that there's a chance. Okay? Even if it's a small one, you have to take it. There's so much we missed out on. Twenty-three years of nothing, Of me wondering who you were, why you didn't want me. And now you're back, only to say goodbye? You can't leave me with these last few months And then just disappear forever. - Talia... Please. - No. You have to try. Okay, mom? Please, mom? Okay. Okay. I'll try. Okay. Okay. And, Talia... I want you to publish your article. You sure? I am so proud of the woman that you've become. Regardless of what happens to me, I'm just so glad that a part of me Will live on through your words...
