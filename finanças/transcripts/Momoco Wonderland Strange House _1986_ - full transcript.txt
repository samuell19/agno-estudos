Oh, I just can't think straight anymore. My sister's out late again. Not even back before dawn. It's just awful. I don't like staying up until morning like this. I'm too scared to sleep when I'm alone, so I force myself to stay awake I just wish she'd cut it out. Huh? I'm home! Oh, it's you. What do you mean? Who did you think it was? It came out again. Oh, it's the same old ghost. It's true. I just got strangled, you know. There's something wrong with you, huh? You think I'm sick? It's you're desires, I'm sure. You just don't believe me. It's not like that. All you've been doing is studying for exams, you don't have a boyfriend, and, with your unhealthy lifestyle, aren't you just hallucinating? It's not a hallucination. I mean, I've never seen anything like that before. That's because you're always partying, so you're never home in the middle of the night That's not true! I was at home two days ago, right? By the way, do you have any experience with "that"? Huh? You're pretending you don't know. "That". You know, "that". Of course not. Never? I knew it. What about you? What experience do you have? Wow, amazing. No way! Huh, you've gone that far? Jealous, aren't you? Pervert. Regardless, you should have more fun. Let's do it tonight, already! Well then, good night, Rika-chan. Come home early tomorrow, okay? Sure, sure. Not getting enough action, huh? Isn't that Rika? Let's go together! Rika! Rika, are you free right now? I guess. Want to come by for a bit? What? There's this secret spot. What is it? Well, let's get psyched up! Let's go, let's go! Pretty good, isn't it? For sure. The cone's delicious too. This is terrible. Doesn't it taste good? What's wrong, Rika? Not doing so well, are you. No matter how many times I eat it, this ice cream tastes terrible. Rika, aren't you studying too much? That's not true. But you're completely oblivious to everything else. It's a bit suspicious, isn't it. It's definitely suspicious. Hey, isn't it weird? All of that. Hey, what are you talking about? Be quiet! That's said, how many ice creams are you eating? Four. If you don't stop you're gonna get fat. It's okay. I'm watching my calories. What do you mean? I'm on a diet. Diet? Starting when you're an adult is too late. Trying to diet with ice cream? Sounds like a joke! I see. So you're parents aren't around, Rika. What? They're dead? Idiot. Of course not. They're out on business. Transferred, right? That's right. To Kyushu. That's why you feel lonely. Yeah, I guess. But don't you have your sister? The thing about that... without parents around, she goes out partying and doesn't come home. Ah, she's a college girl, that's right... She's moving forward in life, you know? So you're by yourself at night, huh. More or less. Well, how about I sleep over at your place next Saturday, Rika? Oh, me too! I'll come too. How about you? Oh, um. I'll ask my mom! It's okay. You don't have to come. I'd like that, but... But what? You have something on Saturday? It's not that. They'll come out again, won't they. Huh? What will? Molesters? No, it's not that. I don't really understand, but... Could it be... Cockroaches! Shut up! What on earth is it... Could it be... Yes. a ghost? I'm home. What's going with Ritsuko? As I thought, she's not coming after all. Oh well, what can you do. Why don't we get going? But she's always causing trouble, isn't she? It's just the same as always. Hey, is Rika's house far from here? Let's see... About 10 minutes, I think? I wonder if Ritsuko knows the way? She'll call me later either way. Ah! Hey ho! What were you doing? We were waiting for you the whole time, Ritsuko! But I got here early, you know. What are you talking about? Cut it out, already. It's all good, right? Let's get going! Seriously. You're absolutely unbelievable. Ah. This is it. What? But it's just a normal house? You're right. Hey. Do you think it'll really show up? Who knows? You really came. What's with the sad face? It's not like that. Tonight, I'm making you curry, okay? Wow. Amazing! Wow. It's a pretty big room, isn't it? It's beautiful. What a luxurious residence. Mmm. Tastes good! It's true. It's delicious. But I can't believe it. It took four hours to make curry rice. I'm the one who can't believe it. I was mixing in the spices the whole time. The key to today's curry was frying the cardamom, cinnamon, and cloves in oil. Why did you fry them in oil? That's how they do it in India. I asked, "why" did you fry them like that? Please ask someone from India. Ritsuko. Huh? What is it? Nothing. Hey. Are all five of us going to sleep here? Why don't you sleep in another room? No, I'm scared. But you won't wake up. I came all this way to see a ghost, you know. That's right, Rika. What happened with the ghost? Hmm... Hey, do this up. Oh, sure. Oh? You have quite the chest, don't you? Don't touch! Megumi's still not here. I wonder if something happened. I'll go check. Sorry to keep you waiting! Don't open the door so suddenly. You scared me. You thought it was a ghost? Idiot. Ah. Did someone come to the bathroom earlier? No one went there. That's strange. I got the feeling that someone was there. Stop it. That's creepy. It's just your imagination. You can see it in the class picture from the trip, standing behind Eriko, they say. What's that? A ghost, of course. What sort? They say it looks like a baby. A miscarriage? No, that's something else. Cause he's a playboy. Hey, what's a Miss Carriage? Hey, hey. This girl may look great on the outside, but her head is totally empty, you know. No. Stop that. Wow, she really has a big chest, doesn't she? It's her only redeeming quality, you know. It's enough to bring a man to tears. Ritsuko, I want you! Ah. We shouldn't! Hey. Megumi's been a while, hasn't she. That girl always takes her time. I'll just quickly check on her. Leave me alone. Hey, Megumi? Are you there? Megumi? Help me! This is bad. Get up. Megumi was... What's happening? Megumi was eaten by the toilet She was eaten by the toilet Who? Megumi. Well, Megumi's just slow. That's not it! Just leave me alone. Oh, is that so? Huh? Ah, that's fine then. Yes. Sorry for the bother. See, she didn't come home. So it wasn't a lie. I'll try calling everywhere I know. Hey, wait. Hello? Rikka, you know what happened to Mayumi? What's wrong? She's not here. I don't think she went home because she left her bags. Maybe Mayumi was eaten by a toilet? No way. I'm serious. I want to believe you, but I can't. Do you want to look for her with me? Okay. Sis! Pardon me for the intrusion. Excuse me, is your father or mother here? What's wrong? Mr. Officer. Will you believe what I tell you? Come here. There's a monster up here, huh. There was. And it ate your friends. You don't believe me? You think I'm crazy, don't you? In any case, just follow up with the head branch, okay? You don't believe me. I mean, I just came to do a check-in on the residence. So, for things like this, the appropriate department should handle - Seriously. I thought I was going to die. I mean, I was scared... Sis. You believe me, don't you? If you don't believe me. Hey, what are you doing? I'm dying. Please stop. I mean, you don't believe me. I believe you. Trust me! You're lying. Don't be so rash. If you keep living, there will be many good things waiting for you. Right? You don't know all good that's out there. It would be such a waste, right? I'm good without knowing those things. Dummy... That's because you're still a child. The second floor. It's my room. There's no mistake. There's nothing here. Shhh. It's in that closet. That's strange. So you don't remember anything? No. But I do remember there was this strange animal. Everybody? Yes. I don't understand at all. I shall make my way back to headquarters, then. I'm going home too. Move. Well, be careful, okay? Bye bye. Well, I'll start to get going now too. What? I totally overslept I'm also meeting somone, you know. You're planning on leaving me alone in this house? But everyone was fine, right? Right? See ya! Since then, my sister stopped going out at night and started staying home. Since then, those strange incidents stopped altogether. Perhaps my feelings of loneliness brought about those incidents. That's what I think. Happy birthday to you. Happy birthday to you! Happy birthday dear Rika-chan. Happy birthday to you. Hello. How was Stranger House? It was our first time acting, and it was very difficult, but it turned out to be a very good experience. Everyone did their best, and we had a fun summer vacation. What I find the most enjoyable these days is going to location shoots, or when I'm happily enjoying the local food by myself. What kind of girl am I? Selfish and absent-minded, I suppose. Something like that. What type of guy do I like? Someone who's kind, trustworthy, and has a nice face. I think someone who is kind and understanding is good, after all. With height and stuff I'm not so... I like it when they're not too tall. Around...173cm is a good height. You know, when it comes to kindness it's not just someone being kind by doing something for you. It's more like when, in a tough situation, you're like, "Oh, what a kind person!", or, "Isn't that nice?" you know? I think. In the future, for example, if it's cool, what I'd like do. I'd study and all that, but mostly stay 13 years old. Also, I like erotic photography and the poses involved So, it would be nice to stay involved with that, but I want to do my best to study and become a teacher. I want to do a lot of things. And I'm still a teenager So I want to try my best to do that. Well... I think for me... When people first meet me they usually see me as just a regular girl. But the truth is, I'm actually the kind of girl you'd call a bit of a weirdo. Walking around town with my friends, we'll go into a shop, and when the music in the shop is playing I'll start singing by myself and everyone says to leave the shop. So there's lots of times I end up all alone. My preferences? Someone who takes my worries and concerns seriously and thinks about them earnestly. Someone like that who I can feel comfortable around would be nice. The most interesting thing right now is... Hmm. I like riding motorcycles. Motorcycles... To put it simply... It's because they're fast and cool. Well... I'm kind of obsessed with motorcycles, but someone who looks good on a bike is nice. In the future, I definitely want to become a solo rider. Um... Summer vacation and all, I wanted to go somewhere, but it was canceled. At first, I was a bit disappointed, but I was able to become closer with everyone, so it was a lot of fun. Summer's coming up. It's basically already summer. At the next cultural festival, we'll be playing in a band, but we're putting our all into it and... it's really fun to be doing that right now, but before that, we have a test and I'm not really looking forward to that. As for my personality... It's similar to Ritsuko's character, I'm a bit reserved, but I might be a bit different from everyone else, But I don't think it's a bad thing. My type of guy is someone who, well... My favorite celebrity is Nakamura Toru, but I really just want someone who can protect me. And I really like guys who play sports too. What's most fun for me right now... Going shopping, hanging out with friends, and just walking around town chatting with them without any set plans. At today's picnic shoot, It was so much fun talking and playing with all our friends. I hope all of us, including you, who watched Stranger House, can see each other again soon. Bye for now!
