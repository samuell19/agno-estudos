Subtitles by demonseye We have India 114, 116, and 260 in position. Flight 104 is 500 yards in trail, waiting for your go. That's it, right there. There's our guy. Begin your final approach to the target. Flight 104, copy that. Shit! Walter! Walter, wake up! Customs. What? Who? We need the fucking bag. Where the fuck is the key? Tighten that line. Now secure the other side. Easy, easy up. Okay, okay. Hurry up. C'mon! C'mon, put it in the bag. C'mon! Pull this up. Come on, come on. Let's go, let's go! Go, Andy. Stop! Federal officer! Don't move! Excuse me. Excuse me, y'all. Can I have everybody's attention? I wanna do a quick toast to the bride and groom, Danny and Shelly. Congratulations. I can't believe it, man. I'm fucking married, Chris. Danny, I know. I was standing right there with you. Look, what about this fucking guy? He's my best friend, best man at my wedding. Doesn't even remember that this is where my reception was. Thank God he's sober. You don't remember? No, I remember throwing up on Kate's shoes. Yeah, I remember, too. I apologized for that. Everybody, do it like this. I mean, you were like the Lennon and McCartney of smuggling. How do you smuggle a fucking Ferrari? And where do you hide it? We didn't. We let customs seize it in port. Gimme your phone. You take the guts out. The transmission, the wiring system... Take all that shit out, hide it inside other containers. So, when customs auctions off the car, he gets himself a Ferrari for next to nothing. He just bought the empty shell? Yes, he got the empty shell... at the auction. And then we... - sell him the missing parts. - ...sold him back... the guts. And he's got himself a new Ferrari for less than you paid for that piece-of-shit Honda. It's a nice Honda. Yeah, that's why you live in it, right? Because it's a nice fucking Honda. Can I dance with my wife? Hey. What's up, buddy? Can I get another one o' these when you get a chance? - Hey, Chris. - Church, hey. How you doin', man? Long time, no see. Where you been? Well, I'm... livin' out in Algiers now. The fuck are you doin' out there? Well, it's nice, I like it out there. It's good for the family. A guy like you don't belong in Algiers, Chris. What are you doin' for work? Started my own business, settin' up alarm systems. Fill that up, will you? Your old man gettin' jailed freak you out? Huh? I guess. That, and having a wife and two little boys, you know? Yeah. You gotta stick to what you're good at, though, Chris. Listen. I offered to take care of that ship captain for your dad. He said no. Anyway, Chris, if you're ever thinkin' of gettin' back in, let me know, okay? Yeah? - Yeah. - Good. I don't even know why we're doin' this in the first place. Just trust me, okay? It'll be... it'll be cool. We try to run, it will make it worse. Where are these guys? Here we go, here we go. Be cool, now. Here we go, here we go. Hey, man. Customs boarded us, we had to dump the package. You did? We had no choice. Right? Nothing we could do, man. That's it. What did I say? I told you it was cool, huh? Come on, man, let's get the fuck outta here. Hello? It's my brother. What happened? Is he okay? - No. We gotta go now. - What? Walter is in surgery. What the fuck happened, Andy? It was an accident. You know what? You're a shitty liar, so don't even fucking try. Look at me when I'm talkin' to you. I was runnin' somethin'. We got boarded... and I dumped it. You dumped what? - The coke. - Oh, fuck. It was over 10 pounds. For who? For Tim Briggs... and those guys. They're gonna kill me. Andy, they're not gonna kill you. It was a lot of stuff. I'm sorry. Oh, you should be fucking sorry. Is he all right? No, the little fuckhead was runnin' something and he dumped it. Now he owes. Who? Who's 'e owe? Tim Briggs. Ask around, see what you can find out, all right? - How is Kate? - Not good. I can't believe he did that. When I quit, I told him to stay away from these guys. Please, if you had anything to do with this, just tell me right now. - I just told you. - Okay. He's my little brother. I know. I'm gonna take care of it. I got you. - I'll call you in the morning. - Okay, no problem. Good night. So, you said King Security put the system in? That's right. A lot o' good it did. Nah, it's a decent system, but your locks are a joke. Anybody who knows the response time... is gonna be able to get in and out. Can you excuse me for one second, sir? Yes. - What's goin' on? - It's about Briggs, Kyle's brother. Yeah, and? I don't know. Hold on. Guys! Guys! How are we doin' today? Is-is, uh, my office still gonna be done last week? You havin' a nice mornin'? Good! Briggs got outta prison two months ago. He hangs out at the Old Point Bar. I'll pop over there after I'm done work and see if I can talk to 'im. Sorry about that, sir. The cameras are nice and small, they'll fit right up there in the corner. Oh, shit! Chris Farraday, back from the dead, man! Yeah! Good to see you, man. Oh, shit. This man was a world-class smuggler here. You were fuckin' Houdini, man. Yeah, he used to run with my brother... God rest his miserable soul. Too bad your, uh, your skill didn't rub off on your shithead brother-in-law. No, no, I know, he's a fuck-up. - Mm. - But he's my wife's little brother. I was hopin' you understand it's family, maybe we could work something out. Well, I don't kno... What do you wanna work out? You wanna work out somethin' with me? I mean, I can figure out a way to pay you back the buy money. No, that's worth 700 grand to me. - Oh, come on, man. - No, come on, man. You're gonna try to charge me full freight for a bad run? Customs boards the boat, you dump that shit. You know how it goes. You know how many passes I gave your brother in his day? Yeah, I hated my brother. Well, what do you wannna do, a payment plan? What, do I look like a bank to you? No, I was just hopin' you could be fucking reasonable, here. Hey! This ain't your world anymore, man! You're a tourist, you can't trade on status you don't have. I got bills to pay. You know, when people fuck that up, that's their fuckin' problem. You think that's funny? That is, you got bills? - I like your outfit. - I liked your brother. We're here today, that's the important thing, huh? So, you know, learnin' to... let go and let God is what's been pullin' me through all of this. You're gonna have to talk me down before I fucking kill Briggs. Probably be better off. I'm one drink away from the worst day of my life. What should I do? ... sittin' in this circle that's had that same thought, right? That's all you gotta do, is work the steps. I'm not doin' another run. No fucking way. I could probably get us the buy money, no problem. No, I finally got somethin' goin'. I'm not gonna chance fuckin' it up. It's not going away, Chris. Somebody wanna share? Sebastian? Wanna share a little bit with us? - Okay. - Oh, yeah. Go do your thing. You don't wanna stick around? No, I get far too emotional hearing that story. - Hey, everyone, I'm Sebastian. - How are you doin', Sebastian? - What the hell happened? - Walter died last night. Briggs came to the hospital. He said it was all on me. I keep getting calls, Chris, and they're talkin' about how they're gonna fucking torture me. I'm shippin' out in the next couple o' days. I'm not comin' back. Do me a favor... and don't tell Kate. Not until I'm gone. When I stopped doin' runs, you promised me you were gonna stay out o' this shit. What do you want me to say, man? Not a fuckin' word! I didn't have anybody to tell me I was fuckin' up. You do! And you put your sister and the boys in this shit? What the fuck is wrong with you? Whoa. You don't come to my fuckin' place. I just came to tell you that I'm gonna have your money within a month. Just stay away from Andy. I ain't waitin' that long. Well, I ain't payin' if he's dead. If a guy dies owin' somethin', his family inherits the debt. So, I'll give you two weeks. If not, I'm gonna come after the both o' you. Then, all the way down the line. I'll come askin' your wife for it, your kids... You think you're the only guy with a fuckin' gun? You'll get your fuckin' money. But if you ever mention my wife and my kids again, you're done. You hear me? You are fuckin' done! Daddy. Oh, it's okay, sweetie. Go back inside. It's okay, sweetie. Daddy and I were just playin', okay? It's okay. Yeah, we're just playin'. - Me and daddy, we're just... - Yeah, we're playin'. - Get up there. - Okay. Yeah, we'll play again. Daddy's okay. It's all right. What the fuck you lookin' at? You stay in the car, I'll go talk to 'er. Okay. - Hey, Chris. - Hey, how are you? Come with me. - Hi. - Hey. Everything okay? Yeah, I just wanted to talk to you for a minute. Okay. I gotta get on the ship with Andy and try to fix this. Are you fucking kidding? What am I gonna do, let 'im go alone? No, we're gonna think of something else. There's nothing else to do, okay? I hate to tell you, but that little dumb fuck has put us in the worst possible position, okay? And if they don't get the money from him, they're comin' after us. So what else do you want me to do? You know what I don't wanna do? I don't wanna fucking visit you in jail like we're visiting your dad, and raising those kids on my own. Oh, so it's my... I don't wannna fight with you about this, okay? I know what I'm doin', all right? Will you just trust me? Please? Nothing's gonna happen. - All right? I promise. - Mm. That shitbag Briggs was here a couple o' years. He tried to smash some guy's head in with a cinder block. Look, I mentioned this to Sebastian. We're doin' another run. Can you get me on your old boat? You mean the Borden? Remember when you were little, you and Sebastian, you're... you broke into McTier's warehouse, stole all that Mardi Gras jewelry, and you came back to the house with a great big box of them beads? You thought they were diamonds. You were grinnin' like you just won the fuckin' lottery. And you said... "You don't have to work on that boat no more." I always think about that. The proudest day of my life was when you turned legit, and you started your own business, and you got outta the life. I-I-I know... you gotta do what you gotta do. I got it. Family is family. I'll get you on the boat. But you get in... you gotta get back out. Me and Andy are shippin' out to Panama with the Borden. - The old man's boat? - Yeah, he got us on. What about captain Camp? I know, I know. Don't worry about it. - What's this? - What's what? Every time I come here, you got new shit. I'm gettin' it together, I'm gettin' the place ready. It's a bad-ass coffee table. That is not for shoes. I must be outta touch. I don't know what's bad-ass anymore cause this looks... cheap-ass. You're turnin' into "The Birdcage". I mean... So, who do we know in Panama? You gonna see... you gonna see Ruben? Dude, no drugs. What else... what else has that kind of profit margin? - Edwin's in Panama. - Currency? We have to bring back a shit-ton to make it worth our while. All right, so I'll bring back a shit-ton. Okay, 15 million on four stacks this big. It's like the size of a Mini Cooper. - But where you gonna hide it? - That's my problem. I need the Borden's crew manifest. Oh, God. You gotta be kidding me. Oh, I like Tarik Mortin. He's a horrible chef, but he's great on runs. Le Cloud's a fuckin' drunk. Newlywed? Yeah. He's not great on runs, but we've known him a long time. Olaf's solid, we need somebody in the engine room. Well, it's no A-Team, but it's the best we can do. Come on, work your magic. Make the call. Get me a TWIC card. Hi, sweet pea. I need you to push through a TWIC card for Chris Farraday. Hey, I got your message. It only took you three years to call me? Are you back in business? No, no, no, no, no, no. I need something, though. Remember our last run? The funny money? I need that exact same shit by next week, but a lot more. Four times as much. And we need a van big enough to transport it, okay? Okay. I'll be here. - Come on, Mikey! - What's funny money? Huh? No, nothin'. Tha... that's just work stuff for dad. Have you ever been convicted of espionage? Just answer "yes" or "no", we'll get through this really quickly. No. Sedition, or conspiracy to commit espionage, sedition, treason? Together? I received your shipping application, Mr., uh.. Lakowski. Mr. Lakowski. Uh, senor Lakowski, I'm getting you a 20-foot standard dry... Would you like us to load it? No, I've got somebody to take care of that. I just need the container. Okay, we'll leave the container standing by for you at the port of Panama. And what are you shipping? A van. Here you go. It takes money to make money, baby. Thank you. - Don't sink, daddy. - Okay, buddy. You're gonna miss my playoff game. I know. I'm sorry. Your mom's gonna take lots of pictures for me, okay? You guys are in charge till I get back. I love you, guys. Just come home, okay? Thank you for doing this, Chris. - I love you. - Love you, too. It's gonna be okay. ID, please. Finger on the scanner. - Captain Camp... - Get the trunk. Get that Captain's carpet cleaner up to the bridge. John, you wanna give me a hand? Hey! You're up top. I get the bottom bunk. Yeah, no kiddin'. Don't act like you don't like this shit. Why, is it that obvious? I love it, but don't tell your sister. All right, come on. You can get your beauty rest later, let's go. My arm, my arm. Keep an eye out. Hey! Someone's comin'. What's up, Chris? Hi, Chris. Ha, ha, Chris. Look at this motherfucker. - Olaf. - Good to see you, man. What's up, Tarik? You okay? What's up, man? - How's your folks? Everybody's good? - Yeah, good, good. That's a hungry man's appetite. This is real good. How you doin', buddy? What the fuck are you doin' on my ship? Did you even check the goddamn crew manifest? How the fuck you let Bud Farraday's spawn aboard my ship? DHS cleared 'im. He was added at the last minute. All right, I'm demotin' him to ship's boy. Yes, sir. You scrub dirt and stay the fuck outta my sight. Otherwise you might have an accident... and wind up in the drink. Show 'im where the carpet cleaner is. - Yes, sir. - Follow me, man. Oh, man, carpet cleaner. Let's go, rug doctor. Oh, you got promoted, huh? They gave you some new stripes on there. I'll be ship's boy. You're still captain's bitch boy. Yeah, yeah. - Okay. - Yes, sir. Oh, everybody's drinkin' tall boys, and nobody's fuckin' workin'. So, what's up, man? You bringin' the vaptain in on this or what? Fuck, no. Well, I remember talkin' to your pops in this same room. He said that same shit. We know how that turned out. - Do you trust me or not? - I do. I do. So what are we runnin'? A shippin'g pallet loaded up with 5,000 uncut sheets of super notes. Best counterfeit money can buy. And just how the hell do you think we're gonna stow that much shit? You worried, buddy? I mean, where is the faith? What, I lost my stripes now? I gotta start from scratch? - Exactly, that shit's void. - No problem. Come on, I'll show you. What do you think? Looks good. Chris, you're a crazy fucker. Not bad, huh? Sixty cubic feet. No fuckin' way. No, it's bigger than 60. Ah, shit! Yeah, man, this is much bigger than 60. We got company. Quick, quick, quick! Hey, what are you doin'? Chris, stop! Andy, be quiet in there. Come on, come on, come on! What the hell are you doin' in here? Oh, I needed a scraper. We noticed some mold in the lower hull. The bleach wasn't cuttin' it, so... Well, you shouldn't be dickin' around in here. Get goin'. I was just tryin' to keep it clean for you, boss. Hey, Chris! Chris! Bring it right back up. Bring it right back up! Come on, you got it! You got it, come on! I can't do it. Goddamn. You gettin' on? No. Do you want me to put you back in the box? That's not funny. I could have suffocated in that box. "I really could have..." Leave the kid alone, man. How are gonna pull this shit off? - We're delivering 300 or so containers. - Yeah. We're pickin' up 500 or more. We're not gonna be in port that long. So we gotta drive out to Chorrillo, see Edwin, load up the bills, and then drive back to the boat during rush hour. It's gonna be tight, but we're gonna be good. It's gonna be too tight. We're cuttin' it close. Might not have enough time. We'll buy more time. - Controllable pitch propeller. - Oh, yeah. Pitch propeller. - Can you drain the oil supply? - The hydraulic chamber won't work. That's the point, stupid ass. Look. We can do it while being towed to the locks. It'll buy us a couple of hours. - Okay? - I don't know. I hate when we fuck with the boat. What? I said, I hate when we fuck with the boat. - Take it easy, big bear. - Olaf, fuck with the boat. Take it easy. Easy. What the fuck? Tarik. That motherfucker will eat you. Okay, out you come. You wanna get any of these for me? - Do we have to? - Yes, mom. Yeah? Okay. Hello? Can I help you? Well, you're pretty. - You wanna play? - Okay. Bye, asshole. Pay the money, just like you owe me. What the fuck are you all lookin' at? You like that, huh? Get your fuckin' hands off me! Come on, put the knife down. Put the knife down. Put the knife down. Leave my mommy alone! Get the fuck back over there! Sit your fucking ass down! It's okay, I'm just playin', now. I'm just playin'. Yeah, don't cry. You seen a gun before? You want it? There ain't gonna be no playin' when I come back next week. You can tell your husband that. - You want this? - Get out! - No! - What the fuck? Get the fuck outta my house! Get the fuck outta my house! Put that thing down, man! You don't think the police are gonna be comin' now? Get the fuck outta here! I didn't mean to shoot at 'im. The little shit hit the gun. You wanna send me back to the farm, you stupid bitch? Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, God. All right, careful. Not too much. - We don't wanna jam it. - Got it. Chris Farraday, to the bridge. Here. - Hey. - He's on his way. Not too much. All right. I-I wasn't getting reception on your cell. Chris, these guys came to the house. They-they.. they had guns. Jesus, are you okay? Are the boys okay? Yeah, we're okay. We're freaked out. I think one of 'em was Tim Briggs, Kyle's brother. I didn't call the police, I don't want them here asking questions. Call Sebastian, okay? Yeah, okay, I will. All right, I love you. Call 'im. Trouble with the missus, Farraday? You want me to talk to 'er for you? Hey, guys, you okay? You had a scary day? Mm-hm. You know, why don't you guys just come and stay at my place? They're not gonna be back, but just for my own peace of mind. You think? Really? Okay. Slow ahead. I said, slow ahead! Reduce to half speed! Why are we not slowin' down? Oil pressure's down. All right. Keep an eye on that temperature. Full astern! Full astern, captain. - Yeah, captain? - Full astern! We're gonna hit the fucking dock! Well, I'm tryin', but I got no pitch control. The fucking prop is jammed! You drained too much oil out! I didn't want you to crash the boat! What? Come on! I'm not gettin' any oil pressure! Let go the port anchor! Jesus, fucking... Let go the fuckin' port anchor! - It's not moving! - Did you release the brake? - Get outta the way! - Move! Turn starboard! Too late! Hard to port, Luke! Hard to port! I'm gonna have to kill the engine! Fucking... We're gonna hit! What the fuck is goin' on around here? - What the fuck happened? - Propeller jam. - Someone tampered with it. - I don't think so. Someone tampered with it. - Sorry about that oil thing. - Don't worry about it. It'ill buy us a little more time. Hey, Michael, look. It's like a spaceship over here. Wow, Sebastian, it's amazing in here. Yeah? It's comin' along, right? Forgot you haven't been here since the renovation. Hey, don't touch that. Fellas... you hang on to this. Okay, that's good. Good aim. Hey, everything okay? Yeah, we're at Sebastian's. The boys okay? Yeah. You in Panama already? Yeah. Keep your phone on you. I love you. I love you, too. I'll call you on my way back. We're almost there. - Hey! - Whoa! You know, you got a lot o' pussy in here. Good to see you, man. - Everything good? - Yeah. Good, you got the cash, the van? - Si, si. - Cool. Yeah. Whoa. - What, you don't trust me? - Oh, I trust you. Esta bueno? No, it's no fucking bueno. Andy, wait here. Danny, come on. Hey, what is it? What are you doin'? I need some iodine. The ink is OVI, the layers are right, but that paper felt different. Hey, que pasa? What's goin' on? You better hope I'm wrong. You fucking idiots didn't print this on starch-free paper. I'm sorry, man. This is the best I have. I don't have time for this. I told you on the phone, I needed exactly what you sold me last time. Gonzalo. Gonzalo has it at the warehouse. What, Gonzalo? That-that little shithead who works for Jesus? No. There's no more Jesus. Gonzalo's runnin' things now. Why didn't you send me to him in the first place? You fucking playin' games with me? Are you fucking playin'... I tried! But he doesn't want anybody goin' there! No, no, no. We're goin' to the warehouse. Let's go. - No, no, no, no, no. - Let's go. Chris, please. Chris, man, look, take the van, man. I'm sorry. Come on, Mikey! Man, the sun's really killin' me. - That kid is big. - He is. - Number 11 is a big kid. - Hold on, I got to take this. Okay. Hello, what's up? He didn't have 'em. Aa... All right. Well, I guess... you're gonna have to bring in some candy. I'm not bringin' in drugs. Just go and see Ruben. - I told you. I'm not bringin' in drugs. Okay? - It's not an option. Chris, Chris, Chris, I'm beggin' you. Please. Chris? Yeah, Chris? Put 'im in the fuckin' van. You know, you come back empty-handed, Andy's gonna get fuckin' hit, and you're still gonna have to come up with the goddamn money. Look, I'll figure it out, okay? Just keep Briggs away from my family, please. Yeah, of course. Hey, I got a little problem at work I gotta take care of. See you later, buddy. - Bye, Sebastian. - Everything okay? Yeah, everything's fine. You got your key? Yeah. I'm tellin' you, man. You know, this... Stay away from Gonzalo. He's been acting crazy lately, you know, since he became a boss. Stay away from 'im. Chris, we should've listened to 'im. We got less than an hour to get back to the boat. It ain't gonna work. It'll work. I mean, do you even know where Gonzalo's warehouse is? We're in fucking Chorrillo right now. I'm lookin' for something to remind me. We're gonna find it. Here we go. Here we go. Look, right here! Here! - Mortin. - Yeah, cap? - Where the hell is Farraday? - Don't know, cap. Didn't know I had to babysit 'im today. Didn't get the memo. Don't piss me off, Mortin. You'll be flipping shit-burgers at McDonald's before you can say "minimum wage". I'm sorry, cap. Sorry. That little visit you paid Kate, the kids, Chris' family? That's my family. You stay away from them. Are we clear? Hi, Sadie. Hi. You know, if you had hired a real smuggler instead of Andy, our package would have come in when it was supposed to. You know, I-I'm really sorry about that. Do you know how fucked up things are for me right now? I know. He said he knew what he was doin'. I didn't know he was his, you know, his brother-in-law. Hey, man, this is way more high-risk than I originally anticipated. I got a wife now. I like my wife. Yeah, I got a wife, too, okay? And don't worry about Gonzalo. I know 'im, he's a little fuckin' punk. Don't worry about it. Oh, yeah? I heard stories about this dude cuttin' people's heads off and shit. I'm lookin' for Gonzalo. Hey, Andy. Stay in the van with the bag. Danny, it's all good. I know this guy, c'mon. You have one new message. Hey, fuckhead, I'm watchin' your sister's kid play soccer. You don't call me back, I'm gonna walk out on that field and put a bullet in 'is head. Chris. Don't... Stop talkin'. Like I said, I want you to take the buy money and go to that address, and talk to a gentleman named Ruben. If you ever wanna see your little nephew again, you take the package and you bring it back, all right? - Hey, is that a wolf? - That ain't no fuckin' dog. Excuse me, senor. Do you mind? Where is he? Where is my old friend Farraday? Bring the van around. Sorry for showing up unannounced. Edwin was tryin' to play games with me. - Where's my buddy Jesus? - We fed him to the wolves. What, literally? I am the new Jesus, cabron. - Good to see you. - You, too. What do you think? It's all mine, motherfucker. All those assholes who thought I was shit? They're dead por culeros. We're taking down a truck. It's a big one. An armored truck. - You wanna join us? Huh? - Are you serious? Andy? Andy! Oh, fuck! Andy! He charges... Michael, not in the house. We're guests. Look at young daddy. He shoots! He scores! Go find your mom. You ain't fuckin' around, huh? Looks like you're ready for anything. You goin' to war or something? I told you. We're taking down a truck. Fucking rock and roll. No shit. You got all these guys. What the fuck's in that truck, man? You wanna know? Then maybe you should show these assholes how it's done. No, look, I... I'll give you the super notes for free. Yeah, thanks anyway. But, look, I got... I got a boat to catch, so... Come on. Don't tell me you don't miss this shit. I got two kids now, man, you know? My cowboy days are over. C'mon, Danny! - The money's gone. And... and Andy. - What? What the fuck are you talkin' about? You come in here and treat me like an asshole? No, primo, I wouldn't do that, man. I should fuckin' blow your brains out. That offer still stand? We ride with you... I get the super notes for free? Yeah, there's something you can do for us. Grab their wallets. Give 'im your wallet. Give me their IDs. We're being fined every minute longer we sit here, captain. Yep. We gotta take that... - Captain. - What's the status? Pitch propeller overheated. It needs oil. We're workin' on it. You got 10 minutes! It's Olaf. Chris, you got 10 minutes. That's not long enough. Have Tarik delay the loading. Look, just stall 'em for as long as you can, okay? Get here. I'll do what I can. See, Chris? This is exactly what I didn't wanna happen. Exactly. I mean, what are we supposed to be doin' here? Blockin' the truck. Right. Right. That's-that's awesome. We're blocking the truck. That's... Like human speed bumps. - Tell my wife that... - Will you shut the fuck up? Look, we're gonna get through this, okay? I'm not tellin' your wife shit! Okay? Ready. They're coming. Put your seatbelt on. He's comin' down. Here we go. Fuck. - He gonna slow down? - Yeah, he's gonna slow down. - You said he's gonna slow down! - Look, he's gonna slow down. He's not slowin' down! Shit! Fuck! Are you all right? Oh, my God. Oh, fuck! Get down! Danny, you okay? I need you to hold containers D, E and F, until I say so. I'm-a pay you 100 dollars, yeah? Fuck! You gotta be fuckin' kiddin' me! Fuck! Get down, Chris!

That's the last container that was boarded. Go on. Anything? No, sir. Smells like it was just cleaned. All right, seal it up. Customs will take it apart when we get back home. I need to tell you... Are you out of your fuckin' mind? Are you fuckin' crazy? Where's the money? Where is it? It's gone! I had to use it. What? Where's the money? What are you tryin' to... What did you just say to me? - I had to use it. - You're fuck... You what? I had to use it. It's in the ceiling. No, you fuckin'... How fuckin' stupid are you? I came out here to help you, to risk my fuckin' freedom and my wife and my children for this? Huh? Motherfucker. What the fuck am I supposed to do with all that? You gotta be the dumbest motherfucker... He said that he was gonna kill Michael. What? You have one saved message. Hey, fuckhead, I'm watchin' your sister's kid play soccer. You don't call me back, I'm-a walk out on that field and put a bullet in his head. Get the bag. - You all right? - Yeah. You all right? You all right? Yeah, yeah. I'm fine. I'm sorry. Calm down, calm down. - Chris. - Hey. Everything okay? Boys all right? Yeah, they're sleeping. What's up? Everything okay? Is Andy okay? Yeah. Don't worry about it. Is Sebastian there? Um, yeah, he is. Do you want me to get him for you? No, no. No, it's okay. Go back to sleep. I'll call you in the morning. Okay. I love you. I love you, too. Chris? Chris, I've been tryin' to call you. What's goin' on? Yeah. Andy picked something up. Really? I thought we weren't doing that. I didn't have a choice. Thank God for Andy taking the initiative, though, huh? Too bad I'm not bringin' it in. Thinkin' of dumpin' it in the sea, actually. Why would you do that? Then we'd all... we'd all be fucked! Take it on faith. I need to talk to you. Something wrong? I told you I would call you with an update. You got a few more days left... before I cut your head off and stick it up your ass. You're asking me, "Is there anything wrong?" Well, I got... I got somethin' comin' in. - You don't sound so sure. - I'm sure. It's comin' in. Flying solo ain't for sidekicks, Abney. I fuckin' warned ya. When you first came to me... for help in keeping your little business afloat, I fuckin' warned you. I said, "You've got to know your limitations." "Don't live beyond your fucking means!" I don't normally do this fucking shit. Tellin' you what's gonna happen when you don't pay. What's the fucking point? You know the rules, right?! Right. You take care, Abney. Jack, neat. Somebody's off the wagon. I want you to go see Kate. Man, I thought she was your family. You know, I mean i-if you wanna fuck his wife, you fuck his wife. But don't waste my time so you can play hero. Chris is falling apart out there. He's gonna dump the package. Don't touch 'er. Just... get her attention. All right. Yeah. Oh, man. Do you think it's gonna work? - It's gonna work. - You think so? - Did you take science in school, Tarik? - Yeah. Then you should know salt dissolves in water, bitch. Are you leavin' soon? Yeah, Sebastian's droppin' the boys off. We're all goin' home. Oh, that's right. Chris is comin' home. Yeah. So, you'll be all smiles in the morning? I hope so. You get outta here, I got it. Good night. - Good night. - Good night, baby. - I'll lock the door. - Thanks. Oh, my God! Get the fuck away from me! My friend will be here, he'll kick your... I'm gonna be perfectly fuckin' clear. You call your husband, you tell 'im not to dump it in the water! You tell 'im that you, Michael and Eddie are all depending on him. Do you understand me? Do you understand me?! Stay away from my kids! - He's got a gun! - Whoa! What are you doin'? What are you doin'? Hey. You all right? Honey, I want you to get in the truck with me. The kids are inside, all right? You smell like alcohol. Yeah, I had a drink. You're drivin' my kids around drunk? Are you fuckin' kiddin' me? Relax. What did he say to you? Come on, get out. We're going in my car. - What's happened? - Let's go. Kate! Guys, get back in the car. Kate... What are you doin'? Kate! Kate! Get in the truck. Fuck. He knew the kids' names. Hold on, you're breakin' up, okay? Let me go outside. Oh, fuck. Cell service sucks here on the river. Hold on, I'm goin' outside. Hello? He told me to tell you... No, hold on. I can't hear you. He told me to tell you not to dump it in... He told me to tell you not to dump it. Who did? Who? The asshole who came to the house! Who the fuck told 'im? What? The boys okay? They're here. We're at Jeanie's. Kate? Hello? Chris, please come home. Chris? Chris?! Hey, how did it go? We boarded up the front window. The cops took a report. They're lookin' for the guy. - All right. - They wanna talk to you. Yeah, yeah. I'm-I'm gonna... I'm gonna go by in the morning. They wanna talk to you now. Yeah, but, uh... we have no stuff. I-I-I gotta go to Sebastian's to get our stuff. Would you mind watching the boys for a second? Look at your forehead. You sure you don't need me to take you to the hospital? No, it's just, uh... It looks worse, uh, it look worse than it is. It just hurts. Like a bruise, you know? I think I should go now before I can't. You know what I mean? I'll see you in a little bit, okay? - Goodbye, mom. - Love you. - Be good boys. - Bye. Sebastian? Did you tell Briggs I was gonna dump it? No. I didn't tell nobody. Don't lie to me. Chris, I'm not fucking lyin' to you. I didn't say shit. - Where did you get the drugs? - From... a guy called Ruben. Sebastian? Hey. Hi. I'm just, uh, gettin' our stuff. You hungry? Let me make you some food. No, I can't. - The boat's not comin' in. - I gotta get back to the boys because Chris will be back tonight. No, he's not. He's not comin' home tonight. I mean, the boat's not comin' in for, like, I don't know, tomorrow. I mean, Chris told me that I had to take care of you, so I'm gonna take care of you. Sebastian, you're not hearin' me? We'll be fine, okay? Yeah, we're fine. - Okay, good. - All right. Good. Give me a hug. - Okay. - Okay. It's been such a big day. What the fuck are you doin'? Nothin'. I'm not doin' anything. I'm tryin' to give my friend a fucking kiss. What's your problem? What's your problem? Kate, come on. Look, I mean, did you even see this? Did you even see this? - Stop it. - Kate. How long have we known each other? You know what? Get your hands off me! Kate? Kate! Leave me the fuck alone! Kate! Kate! Jesus Christ. Kate! I'm tryin' actually to have a conversation with you, and you're actin' like a fucking child. Okay. Good. Why don't you just walk away from the door, and let me get outta here. An ungrateful child. A little fucking brat, who's not grateful for... You want to talk to Chris about what a fuckin' bitch I am? I'm gonna fucking call 'im on the phone right now! Don't call Chris. Don't call Chris. Sweetheart, I love you, but open the door. - I'm calling Chris! - Don't mess with his head now! Why don't you fuckin' tell 'im? Shit! Honey, I'm sorry. You okay? Kate? Kate, it's not funny. Stop fuckin' around. Fuck. You're gonna be okay. You're gonna be okay. Shit. Kate? Kate! Kate! Hey. I know what you did. I know Briggs works for you. You stay the fuck away from my family, or I'm gonna kill you. You hear me? Just bring in the package. Everything's gonna be fine. I'm not bringin' in shit. You'll never see that fucking package. You know, I didn't know about... I can't believe you. You fuckin' played me. I'm not playin' you. This... I'm comin. I'm comin' for you. Okay. Captain Camp. Sebastian. What do you want, Abney? Chris Farraday is runnin' shit. Okay. He's gonna dump the package. If you make sure he doesn't, I will give you his share. Jesus, Abney. You are one cold rat bastard. All right. But if Farraday don't give it up, I'm gonna call in the dogs, and your package is gettin' seized. No, he'll tell you where it is. He won't risk doin' time. Next time you wanna run shit on my ship, you do it right and pay a fare like everybody else. - Where is it? - Where's what? You're runnin' somethin'. I know you're runnin' somethin'. I'm not runnin' anything, captain. - You wanna play that way? - Check. This is your one chance. You give it up now, or you want me to call CBP? I'm not runnin' anything. Your wife asked me to bring some Panamanian dog shit home for her to eat and rub in her fucking cunt... - Fuck you, you piece o' shit. - ... but I didn't have time. You dumb-ass motherfucker! This is how you want it? Yeah, this is how I want it. You wanna go down just like your dumb-ass daddy, you piece o' shit mick? Fuck this. You made it now, motherfucker. Right? Whatever it is, CBP is gonna find it. Yeah, he's in the cafeteria. You're clear. Come on, come on. Shit! Pick up the phone, buddy. Customs and Border Protection, Port of New Orleans. It's Redmond, line two. Redmond. Yeah, John, I got a good tip. Somebody's makin' a run on my ship. Really? All right, listen up, guys and gals, I want an interdiction team ready for deployment in 20 minutes. Let's go. Flight 104, copy that. Three minutes to contact. Ready. Standing by. Holy shit! Well, it was good while it lasted. Who the fuck called the cavalry in? Inspection, please! All crew! Everybody. Who's in here? Welcome aboard. All right, gentlemen, sit down. What the fuck is goin' on? Larry, check the ceiling. Take it down. Wow! Look at this. There's nothing in there. There's nothing in there? Shit! That's enough. A tarp. Tool box with nothing in it. You said you thought it smelled funny, right? - Yes, captain. - Mm-hm. Maybe it's just been cleaned. That's about it. Could be coverin' up something, maybe? Could be. Watch your step. Put the carpet cleaner in the trunk. You got it? Just put it right there, that's fine. Fuck. Oh, shit. - The van in D-7. - What about it? We're takin' it apart now. But you can just save us the trouble, and tell us what's in it. I would love to help you, but I don't know what the fuck you're talkin' about. Do you think we're stupid? And who is Jib Lakowski? Well, it says right there, he's the guy shippin' the van, so maybe you should talk to him. He died in 2004. Then I guess he's not gonna need the van, huh? What's up, Houdini? You got somethin' for me? What are you talkin' about? Come on, man. Just give it to him. Just... What the fuck are you talkin' about? Come on, man! Yeah, I didn't think so. Say goodbye to Andy. - Chris! - Shut the fuck up! Chris!! Don't fuck me, man! What are you doin'? Chris! Run, Andy! Fuck, Briggs. Pull the fuckin' trigger! You don't get your dope if I'm dead. Here. This is it right here. - Right here? - Yeah. What, you got your grandma sellin' cocaine? It's my friend's place. You better not be messin' around, I'll put a bullet in your face. All right, take it easy. C'mon. - Is your friend home? - Quiet. Trust me, you don't wanna wake this fucker up. One, state your position, please. 211, responding. We have a home security alarm triggered at 452 King Drive. Hey, you got some rich friends, man. Come on. Shut that door. Whoo-ee! That's some world-class smugglin' right there, man. Yeah!

I'm gonna take a piss, I've been holdin' it since I got off the boat. All right, you do that. It doesn't wanna come out, man. They make it stubborn... Who the hell are you? What the fuck are you doin' in my goddamn house? Go back to bed, old man. Shit, it's Five-O! Get the fuck out! Pack that shit up, man. Dumbshit. Jeanie, is Kate there? She's not pickin' up her phone. Are the boys with you? Yeah, the boys are here. She left a while ago. Said she was goin' to Sebastian's to get their stuff. Listen, if she calls you, tell 'er to call me right away. Absolutely fuckin' ridiculous. Never seen these idiots before in my life. That one dumbshit right there is bleedin' all over my couch, and they're cuttin' up their drugs. Kate? Kate! Sebastian!

You guys have milked this fuckin' job long enough! Hold it! We're pouring over on the south corner. Take it over there. What the hell's goin' on here? I thought we were doin' the other side. Why you movin' the cement truck? You're blockin' the fucking trucks. You send guys to my house? Huh? I trusted you with my wife and my kids. And I fucking loved you like a brother. Where is Kate? Where the fuck... is Kate? One... more... fucking time. Where's Kate? She's gone. You okay, Seb? Whose phone is this? Who left their phone here? Turn that fuckin' thing off, now! Chris? Oh, my God!
