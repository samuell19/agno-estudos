Lots of love! What? You little mutt! - Come back here! - Oh! Bring back my gyros! Hey, watch it! Excuse me. Pardon me. Whoa! - Hey! Bone-headed pooch! - Sorry! Ruh-roh! Dispatch, I've got a stray dog on a tube of compressed meat. Repeat. I have a grand theft gyro in progress. Hey, slow it down! Huh? Yikes. Whoa! Hey! Zoinks! Like, slow down, dude. ♪ Show me the meaning of being lonely ♪ ♪ One is the loneliest number ♪ ♪ Lonely ♪ ♪ I'm Mr. Lonely ♪ Hello, I'm Ira Glass. Welcome to another episode of my new podcast, Friends, Who Needs Them? You Do. This week's challenge, put yourself out there. When the hand of friendship is offered to you, take it. You can do it. Now, go. Make some friends. Excuse me! Coming through! Dude! Whew! Huh? Make friends. Check. Nice to meet you, Shelly and Sandy. How was your day? Oh, you want me to start? How polite, Sandy. Well, I told my mom I was meeting my pals at the beach. So, if she asks, this technically counts as a playdate. But it's all good. I like eating lunch by myself. And hanging out by myself. And playing ping-pong by myself. I lose a lot of balls. Ahh! I gotta warn you, it's got gummy worms, tater tots, and ketchup leather. Hmm. I know. No liverwurst. It's not like me to forget the protein. Yeah, I get it. Nobody likes my sandwiches. Whoa! Mm. Is that peppercorn? Sand. - There you are! - Ahh! This mangy stray's done enough damage for today. He's coming with me. He's not a stray. Is he your dog? He is, like, totally mine. If you wanna be. I'd like that very much. Okay, then. What's his name? I don't have one. His name's... - Snacks. - What? Snacks? Uh, I mean... Scooby! Middle name? Dooby? Last name. Doo. All right. If the dog has a middle name, there's no punishment for damages or theft. I don't like it, but them's the laws. Well, have a good day, sir. Mr. Dooby-Doo. I'm Norville, but everyone calls me Shaggy. Raggy. No, it's Shaggy. That's what I said. Raggy. We'll work on it. Shaggy, you and your new friend better hurry up if you want to trick-or-treat. Yay! Okay, Mom. Let me show you my room. I mean, our room. Who's that? This is Blue Falcon. He's half-man, half-falcon. Well, mostly man. All man. I guess it's just the suit that's falcon. And his wonder dog sidekick, Dynomutt. Like, they solve crimes and save the world together. Cool. Ooh! What's this? - It's a bed. You sleep in it. - Huh. Soft. I've never had a bed before. In fact, I've never had anything before. I, uh... I ran out this afternoon and I got something for you. I know we just met and I didn't wanna seem too desperate or, you know, come on too strong, but... I love it. I promise I'll never take it off. Thanks. Thank you! Trick or treat! I love Halloween! And may I say, you sure look good in that costume. Ranks, Raggy. It's all in the hips. Whoa! Jackpot! Big house, big candy. Like, no way, bro. That's the Rigby house. It's haunted. Let's get outta here! Mine! Hey! Give it back! Yeah! We worked hard for that free candy. This stuff will rot your teeth. Yeah. Don't you know Halloween is just a marketing ploy by Big Corn Syrup? Yeah, we're okay with that. Ruh-roh. Your blood sugar will thank us. Are you guys all right? Yeah. They just hurt my pride. And my tail feathers. Let me give you a hand. I'm Fred. - This is Velma. - Hi. - And that's Daphne. - Hey. I'm Shaggy. And this is Scooby-Doo. Nice to meet you. Cool Wonder Woman costume. And are you... Harry Potter? I'm Ruth Bader Ginsburg, obviously. Which house is she in? Hufflepuff? She's a Supreme Court justice. Oh. Slytherin. Come on. Let's go get your candy back. Wait, that's the Rigby house. It's haunted by a ghost. Ghost? Ghost or no ghost, it's Halloween. No one should go home without their candy. Uh... Okay. We'll go in the haunted house this one time, but we're not gonna make a habit out of this. Right, Scoob? Right. Hello? Anybody home? This living room feels more like a dying room. Here you go, Shaggy. Great. Thanks a bunch. Let's go. It's the ghost! Guys, there's no such thing as ghosts. Hmm. Uh... Girl dressed like Judge Judy, I don't think this is a good idea. Huh? - The ghost! - Go get help! Aah! Come on, hurry! Guys, we gotta do something. - Quick, upstairs! - Come on, let's go! Daphne! Whoa! Run, Daphne, run! Fred, look! Uh-oh. Velma! Got it. Hey! What are you... Oh. Oh. Huh? Gotcha. Jeepers. It's a Halloween mask. Mr. Rigby! Uh, guys? I think we just found the world's smallest Walmart. Man, this guy stole a lot of stuff! Bag it all up, Frank. He's going away for a long time. I would've gotten away with this if it weren't for you meddling... Congratulations, everyone. We just proved this house wasn't haunted, and busted a perp. And even better, we got our candy back. Not bad for a bunch of kids. Maybe we should do this again. - I like it. - I'm in. What do you say, guys? We're in. I mean, like, how many scary monsters could there be? ♪ Scooby-Dooby-Doo ♪ ♪ Where are you? ♪ ♪ We got some work to do now ♪ ♪ Scooby-Dooby-Doo Where are you? ♪ ♪ We need some help From you now ♪ ♪ Come on, Scooby-Doo I see you ♪ ♪ Pretending you Got a sliver ♪ ♪ But you're not fooling me 'Cause I can see ♪ ♪ The way you Shake and shiver ♪ ♪ You know we got A mystery to solve ♪ ♪ So, Scooby-Doo Be ready for your act ♪ ♪ Don't hold back ♪ ♪ And, Scooby-Doo If you come through ♪ ♪ You're gonna have yourself A Scooby Snack ♪ ♪ That's a fact! ♪ ♪ Scooby-Dooby-Doo Here are you ♪ ♪ You're ready And you're willin' ♪ ♪ If we can count on you Scooby-Doo ♪ ♪ I know We'll catch that villain ♪ All right, everybody. I would like to pose to you all the question of questions. What's next for Mystery Inc.? Ooh, I totally have the answer. Lunch. No, Shaggy, I think what Fred means is that... I was also gonna say lunch. Guys, guys, guys. The Mystery Machine needs a whole new... Needs a whole new everything, and I'm never gonna get that smell out. I told you I needed a walk. It's time to turn Mystery Inc. into a real business. What do you mean? Like, carry a briefcase, and wear a tie, and pay taxes? Wait, have you not been paying your taxes? I handle our accounting. Look, we're ready to take on bigger cases, scarier villains, and creepier mysteries, but that takes money. Fortunately, we found a possible investor. Oh, whoopee, a diner. I'll have a napkin and some hand sanitizer. Whoa, man! It's Simon Cowell. ♪ In the shallow ♪ ♪ In the shallow ♪ ♪ I'm off the deep end Watch as I dive in ♪ Uh, congratulations, gentlemen. You are terrible. How does he do that? See, he's mean, but he makes it fun. We appreciate your interest in Mystery Inc., Mr. Cowell. Every successful group requires hard work and determination. Identifying potential is what I do, and you have got it. Fred, you're the tank. The muscle. - Cool. - Daphne is the people person. The empath. - Aw. - And Velma's got the smarts - and technical savvy. - Thanks. But you two aren't even listening. You're eating a clownishly oversized sandwich. Like, sorry, man. You lost us at, "Hard work and determination." But you got us back at "sandwich." Look, a group can only be as strong as its weakest links. Bottom line, I can't invest with these two involved. But, Mr. Cowell, Shaggy and Scooby are our best friends. Yeah, and like, what's more valuable than friendship? Literally, anything. You can't count on friendship. People change. And when you get into real trouble, friendship won't save the day. Like, we don't need this, Scoob. Let's bounce. Yeah, we know when we're not wanted. No. - Ugh. Wait. - Come on, guys. He didn't mean it. No fries for you. Hmm! You believe the nerve of that dude? Simon Cowell thinks friendship won't save the day. What does he know? Yeah, he's not that smart. Just sounds like it, because he's British. Good point, Raggy. As long as we have each other, we'll be just fine on our own. Right. Yes! Eyes? Raggy, look. - Huh? - The pin. It has eyes. Oh, Scoob, I know it feels like everyone's judging us today. Even the bowling pins. But don't freak out on me, bud. Uh... What's the hold-up? The ball return won't return our ball. Huh. Oh, there it is. Zoinks! Like, what is going on? What are those things? I don't know, but they don't look friendly. No offense, but I think I liked you better as a bowling ball. Me, too. Look out! Whoa! No running. They're coming. - What now? - Follow my lead. Who's hungry? Check out the specials. So, like, what are you guys in the mood to eat? And please don't say human. Or dog. Okay, Bowling Alley Yakitori. And how about you guys? Hot wings to share? Uh-huh. Got it. And for you? Oh, no! We're out of calamari. This way, Scoob! Huh, I always wondered what was back here. Underwhelming. All units. Attention, all units. We have a 4-1-5 in progress at the Takamoto Bowl. "Tiny violent shape-shifting robots chasing a man and a dog in a bowling alley, linen store or car wash." Wow, the police really do have a code for everything. The Takamoto Bowl? That's where Scoob and Shaggy hang out. Oh, no. Let's go. Did we lose 'em? Pretty sure we didn't. Yikes! Looks like this is goodbye, old buddy. We never saw Paris. Huh? Oh, man, dig that crazy elevator. You okay, Scooby-Doo? Yeah. I'm good. Whew. Where are we? Dude, hang on. Do you realize where we are? - No. - Look around, man. The clean, modern aesthetic. The cool blue color palette. - We're in... - IKEA! ...the Falcon Fury! Did you say IKEA? Nope. I said Falcon Fury. Just like you. Gentlemen, welcome aboard. I'm Dee Dee Skyes, pilot of the Falcon Fury. - Well, we're Scoob... - Scooby and Shaggy. We know. Follow me. Who sent those robots? It's this guy named Dick Dastardly. Shocker! He's a psychotic supervillain. He's trying to you. Scoob, somebody thinks we're important enough to... It's nice to be wanted. Mm, I hear that. Oh, wow! - Look! Look! - Wow. Yes, I know it's super cool in here, and I would totally let you guys press random buttons, but they told me we need to move. Seriously? We're doing this now? Ooh. Is it him? Is it him? Yep. He likes to make an entrance. Ladies and gentlemen, since the dawn of time... ...the falcon has been worshipped as a symbol of freedom and victory. Now, a new kind of falcon rules the sky. And he is one bad mamma jamma. Blue Falcon! Ooh, yeah! Welcome to the Falcon Fury. Hang on, hang on. Turn on the lights. Where are my balloons, Dee Dee? When I say "Falcon Fury," that's supposed to cue the balloons. Keith, what is the deal up there, man? I missed the cue. Duh. You've got one job, pal. Anyway, welcome aboard, I'm Blue Falcon. No, you're not. Yes, I am. I told you I wasn't going to be the only one who noticed. No, Blue Falcon's suit has a bigger red "F" on the chest, and it's way less, uh, scaly. They're feathers, all right? And it's called an upgrade. This ain't your daddy's Blue Falcon. I think you mean this ain't your daddy's Blue Falcon. Allow me to introduce you to Blue Falcon's large adult son, Brian. Dynomutt! Oh, him you recognize? Well, sure, man! Dynomutt is the dog wonder. Blue Falcon doesn't go anywhere without him. And yet here I am. Without him. Ow! What was that for? Making sure this isn't a dream. You're supposed to pinch yourself. - Ow! - Ow! - Oh! - Ow! Ow. Finished? - Ow! - Yes. - Wait, Brian... - Blue Falcon. - If you're Blue Falcon now... - I am. - Does that mean... - Yes. Regretfully, my father has moved on to a better place. Oh, no! What? Oh, no, he's not dead. He retired to Palm Beach. We still miss him very, very, very, - very, very... - Oh, no, he's glitching. No, I'm not. Let me finish. ...very, very, very much. It's Dastardly. He must have tracked you here from the bowling alley. Let's move it, people. To the Falcon Nest. Like, hey, wait up! Nobody gets away from Dick Dastardly. Right, Rottens? I need what's on that ship, or I'll never get my treasure. Do not fail me. Dee Dee, take the helm. Ready, sir. You might want to buckle up. And if you get sick, puke on Brian. Punch it, Dee Dee. Hang on. - Zoinks! - What's this guy's deal? Look, the hot goss on my fan site is that Dastardly's collecting the three shells of Seabiscuit... It's skulls of Cerberus, Brian. We went over this. He's got one skull. Our mission is to make sure he doesn't get the other two. Like, what do those creepy skulls have to do with us? No idea. Hold tight. - I can't shake him. - Try the shake button. Ooh, I'll take a chocolate shake. Vanilla, please. - There is no shake button. - Well, there should be. All right, Rottens. Launch the harpoons. Incoming! What is going on? Well done. Reel them in. Dynomutt, can you reverse the polarity of the tractor beam? Of course, but that would make... - Reverse on my mark. - On it. Now! Why have we stopped pulling in that ship? Oh, no, no, no. No, no. No! Argh! Drat! Whew. Are you guys okay? Yeah, but, like, if you want, you can pull over and drop us off here. We'll walk home. Dastardly could have finished us if he wanted to. I think he wants you guys alive. I knew you two were important. It would be safer for you if you joined us on our mission. It would? Ring, ring! Ring, ring! Ring, ring! Ring, ring! Boop! Hello? Oh! Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Well, of course. Uh, guys, adventure's calling, and it's for you. Hello, adventure. Yes, will you take my name and number off your list? But, Raggy, this is our chance. Yeah, maybe you're right. We can show everyone we're not the weak link. Uh, Mr. Adventure, sir, it's me again. Uh, my partner is intrigued by your offer, but I'm still on the fence. We're gonna have to call you back. Bye-bye. Click. - You really wanna do this? - Uh-huh. Well, I'm not gonna let you do it without me. After all, there is no "I" in Scooby and Shaggy. Wait, is there? No, all good. We're in. That's what I'm talking about! Now, I've got a few waivers for you guys to sign. Oh, great. Great timing, Keith. Thank you! Well, uh, the robots attacked this talking dog and a gangly dude that had this habit of using the word "like" at the start of every sentence. Almost as if he was some middle-aged man's idea of how a teenage hippie talks. Oh, that's Scoob and Shaggy all right. So, what happened? I don't know. They seemed pretty bummed out. I guess their friends dumped them in a cold-hearted way or something. And then this blue light came down from the sky and beamed them up. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Shaggy and Scooby were taken? Yeah. I'd have to assume that if they were with their friends, they wouldn't have been kidnapped., I can't... I can't breathe. Whoever those friends are must be carrying a ton of guilt on their shoulders right about now. Okay, can you skip the emotional punishment and describe the robots, please? Yeah, sure. Uh, they looked like what's in this box. Whoa! Guys, this thing is increíble. It's fully autonomous and capable of modifying its external appearance. I'd like to shake the hand of whoever created this. And then, you know, throw that hand in prison for trying to kill our friends. Right? Am I right? Ew! Is that... a hair? Maybe this can lead us to our culprit. What are you doing? You're touching it with bare fingers. Grow up, Fred. Do you know how many stray hairs the average human eats every day without knowing it? If it's more than zero, I don't wanna know. It's more. Much, much more. Huh. Trace amounts of mustache oil. 12-year-old Scotch. Ugh. Is the bad guy my dad? There are also some microscopic soil particles. Composition is a mix of arsenic, selenium and... Coppertone SPF 50. Anything over 30 is a waste. I'll see if the combination of these elements matches a geographical location. And... Bingo. Dastardly Demolition. Per county records, last known owner is... Dick Dastardly. What would a creep like that want with Scooby and Shaggy? Hmm. Well, let's see what the police department database has to say. Ooh. Quite a rap sheet. It looks like he's wanted for the theft of archeological artifacts from a dig in Peru. Tatty bye. That looks like a giant dog skull. Weird. It gets weirder. He also stole the genealogical records of a dozen dogs from the Global Kennel Club. And apparently he's been stealing Netflix by using his mother's account. That is not fair for the rest of us who have to pay for Netflix. You have to pay for Netflix? This will not stand. Let's go get that Dastardly dude. I just needed you to retrieve one simple canine, so I could get my treasure. Now, were the missions a failure? Pinhead. The question was rhetorical. Of course it was a failure because you failed me. You are responsible for my suffering. Oh, sorry. You're sorry? You certainly are. And I thought my last sidekick was worthless. At least he had a backbone. And fur and a wet nose. But you, whoa-ho-ho, you've lowered the bar to new depths of craven ineptitude I didn't even think were possible. That's not a compliment, you aluminum imbecile! You're not a partner, you're a disgrace, a lemming, a boot-licking... ...suck-up. An example must be made. I want you to know this is going to hurt me a lot more than it's going to hurt you. No, not really. Let this be a lesson to you all. If you're going to be a sniveling suck-face... ...you're going to look the part. Forget you mechanical morons. I'll fetch the key myself. To find the second skull, I'm searching every possible location with high fossil density. Brian! Quit putting filters on your selfies and get in the game. Whoa, whoa, what do you think I'm doing? I'm putting my social media feelers out there, Dynobutt. Found it! The second skull? No. Even better. The Falcon Fridge. FYI, you are officially out of... everything. Yes! I love these guys. I'm busting my tail to save the world for him, and he loves the guys who brought treats. Prepare your taste buds for a Scoob-Shag specialty. Whoa, whoa. You put jalapeño peppers on your ice cream? Heat and sweet. It's our signature dessert. Heat signature! That's it! You guys are geniuses! We're geniuses. Take that, Simon Cowell. The supernatural energy in that skull would give off a specific heat signature. All we gotta do is locate that spot. Boom! The skull is in the Gobi Desert. Incorrect. I just found out where the skull is, and it's not in the Gobi Desert. It's in Romania. Like, how do you know? A hero never reveals his secrets. I believe you're thinking of magicians. I'm always thinking of magicians. But if you must know, I got a DM from one of my fans who gave me the locayshe. Brian, those are a lot of words no one your age should be using. Sir, this could be a trap set by Dastardly. If it was a trap, why would Anonymous use his own name? Wait, do you think "Anonymous" is the name of a person? Well, based on your tone of voice, I don't any more. Sir, we really should go to the Gobi Desert. I hear you. You make a valid point, but we're gonna do my thing, okay? To the Falcon Nest. Brian, last time you listened to someone on the Internet, you thought Tinder was an app that delivers firewood. Velma, what do you got? I built a sequencing program to cross-match the biographical data that Dastardly stole from the canine registry against Scooby-Doo. Good thing I'm the tank, because I could not do any of that. Any leads? All the dogs, and Scooby, seem to be related. Jeepers. If I take Dastardly's work and follow the trail... Whoa! Scooby-Doo is the last descendant of Peritas? Who's Peritas? He was Alexander the Great's dog. Okay, so, Scooby is related to some ancient dog. - So, what does that mean? - I have no idea. Guys, this is our most important mystery ever. Yeah. This isn't about some guy in a rubber mask. It's about one of us. Fred, how much longer to Dastardly Demolition? I know a shortcut. Hustle, you two! We haven't got all day! Second thoughts? Honestly, buddy, I'm on my 4th or 5th thoughts. Oh, man. This amusement park isn't very amusing! According to Anonymous, the second skull should be right here. Hey! Did Dastardly get the anonymous tip, too? You dim-witted do-gooders! I've already retrieved the second skull from the Gobi Desert. Gobi Desert? Hmm. Where have I heard that before? Oh, right, me. Okay, Brian, we've had our differences, but this is the moment where we stand together and... Run! Classic Brian. Dee Dee, you cover Scooby and Shaggy. I'll run interference. Stop right there, you filthy animal. And your dog, too. This way! Aw. Weak link, my butt. Whoa, dude! What do you want with us? I don't care about you. You're not remotely important. It's the dog I need. Raggy! Stay! Sit! Heel! Did nobody train this thing? Oh, hey. Look, I know it looks like I'm hiding, but this is actually a superior vantage point! Whoa! Scooby-Dooby-Doo? Where are you? Come on now. Don't be scared. I love dogs. I had a dog myself once. He was an ill-tempered brute with a ghastly underbite, who stunk and caused me endless headaches. He's lost now. Is he chipped? Forget about him. It's all about you. You, my friend, are special. You see, within you lies a key. What... I don't have your key. No pockets. No. You are the key. Join me, Scooby-Doo, and I will show you how to harness your destiny and become the most important dog in the world. No, thanks, Dastardly. Oh, please. My friends call me... Dick. Rokay, Rick. No, I'm not a Rick. I'm a Dick. With a D. Rick. With a D. D-D-D-Dick! R-R-R-Rick. Dick, Dick, Dick! Drat. Brian! Do something! - Like what? - Like drop some F-bombs. Hey, man, whoa, let's keep it PG. No. Falcon bombs! You know, my utility belt has so many little pouches. - They're right there! - Ah! 12 trillion volts, brother. - You wanna throw it? - Do I ever! F-bombs away! Here, boy! Where are you? You're mine, Scooby-Doo! Sit. Good boy. You can start screaming... now. Follow that dog. - Brian! - Raggy! Whoo-hoo! I hate the loops. Give me that dog! - Raggy! - Scooby! Everybody say, "Hashtag foxy Falcon." Hashtag foxy Falcon! Drat! Not again. Dastardly will be back. Please tell me you got some leads. Dastardly said I was the key. - The key to what? - Ah-ha! - I knew this guy was special! - Why? Because the bad guy said so? Exactly! What did Dastardly say about you? Well, I believe his exact words were, uh, "I don't care about you. You're not remotely important." And, "It's the dog I need." Harsh. And then he shot me through the wall. Really harsh. But, on the bright side, your friend is super important. Now let's get that dog a hero suit! - Huh? - Shouldn't we be focusing on finding that third skull before Dastardly? Or why Scooby is so important? - It could be a clue to... - Details. All right, first things first. Come on, Scooby-Doo! - Cool. - Uh... Right behind you, Scoob. Drat, drat, and double drat! What is it? Scooby-Doo's friends. How perfect. Send me their location immediately. Oh! Huh? - Like, what's wrong? - I don't know. Oh, looks like that old collar's in the way of the chest panel. Huh? Hmm? Whoa. Awesome! What do you think, Raggy? Looks great. Hey. Hey, man. You're feeling left out. I get it. Totally natural when two buddies realize that one of them is destined for greatness and the other one is destined for, you know, other stuff. Look, the point is, I got you something, too. Keith. Give it to me. My Blue Falcon Confidence Pack. Retails for $99.95. You got your Blue Falcon Nutrition Guide, Blue Falcon resistance bands, a copy of my dad's autobiography, No Falcon Around, and my light-hearted follow-up, Just Falcon Around. Oh, thanks, man. It means a lot to hear that from you. How do you mean? Well, you know, we both struggle with confidence. When Dastardly attacked, we were both freaking out and hiding. Hey! It was a superior vantage point! But, like, your father was this great hero, right? So, like, you're expected to be one, too, and those are big shoes to fill. I mean, the pressure is monumental. Not to mention the imposter's syndrome that comes with the territory. How do you breathe under the weight of all that? Uh... Dyno, what do you got? The signal's too weak. I can't lock in the exact coordinates. I'm gonna cross-check the triangulation pattern. Oh! Super cool. Better than bowling, huh? Hurry, Fred! Shaggy and Scooby are in trouble and your shortcut to Dastardly Demolition is taking forever. Technically, this route is 73 meters longer than the highway. Meters, Velma? I don't even know what that means. What are we, in Europe? It's a quantitatively superior measurement system. Get with the program, Fred. Oh, you mean like your program? "I'm Velma." "The world is ones and zeros." Maybe if you spent more time reading books, - then... - Guys! Stop. Why are we fighting? We didn't eat lunch! We're just hangry. Ever since Shag and Scoob disappeared, there's been no one to feed us ridiculous sandwiches at lunch. I miss them. Oh, me, too. Those little pickles on top are the best. No! The guys, not the sandwiches. Aw, I miss them, too. Ready? Ready! Okay, Shaggy, take the picture. Hurry up and take it. This hurts my face. Shaggy, you have it on video. Oops! Sorry. Jinkies! Scooby and Shaggy are with Blue Falcon? Of course. Blue light, beamed up. That's the Falcon Fury. How do you know so much about superheroes and so little about the metric system? Because I'm an American man. Oh, I'm so happy they're okay. Oh, no. Pull over. Oh, boy. Okay, guys. Let me do the talking. I've seen Cops at least six times. So, I know exactly what to say. Good evening, Officer... Fred, say something! Hi. Do you kids have any idea how fast you were going? Was it, uh, too fast? Funny story, Officer. We were rushing to capture this evil villain who we thought was trying to kill our friends. Uh-huh. Step out of the vehicle. All of you. You've gotta believe us, Officer. This guy is really dangerous. Ooh, dangerous. Sounds like he's a... handsome guy. Oh, no, no. Bulbous nose. Huge chin. Yeah, but in a cool way, like Gérard Depardieu. No, in a super gross way. Like a rat and a mound of hair had a baby. How dare you! Dick Dastardly! I have so many mixed feelings. How did you find us? Oh, let's just say I had insider information. You have the right to remain silent. And everything you said about my face... ...will be used against you in a court of claw! Ah. Mm. Does this make my ears look big? Makes your ego look big. What did you say? I said, uh, fine. You look, uh, fine. It sounded like you said "ego." Nope. Must be in your head. - Hmm. - Your giant, inflated head. - What? - Nothing. Scooby! We need you! As far as masks go, I gotta say, she was pretty hot. Fred, focus. We've got to find a way to contact Scooby and Shaggy. There goes the last bobby pin. Daphne, what are you doing? If Scooby and Shaggy were here, they would accidentally sit on a rigged chair, or bump their heads against a wall and it would open a secret passage out of here. They are surprisingly effective goofballs. Whoa! Ow. Aw. Poor little thing. Uh, Daph, he's not on our side. Do you need help? It's okay. I want to help you. Better? Aw, you're welcome. Hey, hey. Do you think you can help us get out of here, little buddy? Cool. Now, reveal the final skull to me. Your reunion is nigh! My heart's desire is within reach! Perfect. We have it! Set a course for Messick Mountain! Messick Mountain? We can't let him get there first. We have to warn Blue Falcon. Huh? There's a communications device. I'm gonna see if I can find a backdoor into Blue Falcon's comms, but I have no idea what I'm patching into. I've narrowed my search down to 11 possible hot spots. Oh. That one is a volcano. Ten possible hot spots. We need to search... I suddenly feel funky. - And I'm in. - I've been hacked. - Dynomutt! - Emergency. Blue Falcon, come in, Blue Falcon! I repeat, this is an emergency. Stay out of my search history. My name is Velma Dinkley. Who names their kid Velma? We are prisoners of Dick Dastardly! Yikes! Where are you? I don't know, but we're heading towards a place called Messick Mountain. That's close to a possible third hot spot! That's it! The skull must be beneath the mountain! That was unpleasant. Hello? Hello? Where are Scooby and Shaggy? - Hello? Hello? - Whoa! - We lost the signal. - Velma? Check it. That's a lock. But to where? The Gates to the Underworld. It all makes sense now. Oh, boy. That's the serious face. We always get in trouble after that face. Alexander the Great and Peritas conquered the world and built the gates to protect their enormous treasure. That's where the lock comes in. Only Alexander or Peritas can unlock it. Or one of their descendants. Dastardly's going to use Scooby to unlock the Gates to the Underworld. So what? What happens then? Then all hell breaks loose. Literally. There's more than treasure behind those gates. Oh, jinkies. What? I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Someone had to say it. Look over there. Whoa. "Muttley." Put that down! You have no right to be in here, Mystery Morons. It's Mystery Inc. Yeah, Fred. He knows. Who is Muttley? Muttley was my partner... my criminal co-conspirator. Until... Until... I opened a portal, a backdoor to the underworld. And through it, a glowing gold vision. As I was about to enter, Muttley insisted on taking the risk himself. Rasm-Frasm. Ingrate. I pleaded with him, "Muttley, please don't do this." But no. The flatulent fleabag wouldn't listen to reason. Ta-da! Good boy, Muttley. Bring it! Yes, yes, come on. But that ticket was a one-way trip. Muttley? Even if I'd opened a billion portals, he could never come back. - Uh-oh. - Muttley! Oh, no. No! Get out of there! Muttley! Muttley! Because Muttley isn't the key. Return them to their cell. Please, Dastardly, if you unlock those gates, you'll... Stop! Poor man's Hemsworth stays with me. - No. - How dare you? Wait. Chris or Liam? What are you doing with him? Oh, I have grand plans for Freddie boy. I'm picking up the skull signature. Locking on. These suits are incredible, right? Yeah! Accentuates the good stuff, hides the flaws. I love it. I wanna see cheeks to seats, people. Straps activated. But my cheeks still need a seat! Here we go! Shaggy, what are you doing? Not so close. We're about to get closer. - Dee Dee, I advise we... - Punch it! Wow. The heat from the geothermal vents is creating a completely unique ecosystem. Which appears to be Mesozoic. Just land the ship, Dee Dee! Okay, Falcon Force. Good luck. Bring back that skull. Scooby and I will stay on the ship. You know, where it's safe and secure. Dude, I'm pretty sure Scooby is gonna be safest with us. We're literally superheroes. No, you don't get it. We're chickens and we always stick together, so we're staying here. Scoob? Scoob's clearly important to whatever Dastardly's got planned. We need him. Yeah. I'm the key. The key? You're not the key. You're my best friend. At least I thought you were until you whipped off your collar. My collar? You gave me the nod. But I didn't think you'd really do it. Just come with us. "Us"? You're an "us" now? Well, what happened to us-us? Raggy. You need to choose. Now, I'm staying on the ship. Are you staying with me, or going with them? That's not fair. Choose. I never thought I'd say this, but Simon Cowell was right. You can't count on friendship. You know what? Simon Cowell is always right. He gave the world Kelly Clarkson. I mean, how much proof do you need? Hey, man, that breakup was brutal. All right, Shaggy was totally out of line. We've never had a fight before. Brian! Less talk, more walk! See? I'm dealing with the same thing with Dynobutt. He's constantly riding me. He expects me to be just like my dad, and I'm not. No, you're not. All I need is a moment. A hero moment. To prove to him and the world that I can do this. Maybe we both do. This thing still isn't working. Dyno, what do you got? I got bupkis. Who needs your techno-malarkey when we got this guy? Now, let's let the real dog sniff out this bone. Got it! Have fun being last! What are you doing? Huh. Raggy's never missed. Hello! Your tiny little brains probably can't understand me. So, I will speak slowly, so that you may process the welcoming tones of my voice. Uh, we understand you perfectly. Oh, word? No disrespect. So, what brings you guys to Mystery Island? We're looking for a skull. Yeah, it's about yea high, and full of sharp, pointy teeth. You mean a slaghoople? Um, sure. Why didn't you say so? Follow me. And mind the pterodactyl droppings. But if you get some on you, rub it in. It's just like lotion. Huh? I will never leave you. No matter what. Huh? Hey! Fred? - Shaggy? - Fred! Shaggy! Wait, how'd you get here? Where are Daphne and Velma? Dastardly kidnapped us and was holding us captive on his super awesome airship. Jeez, that thing is cool. But never mind that. Where's Scooby-Doo? Has he been taken? No. He's with his new "hero" friends. We're on a break. You've missed a lot. Shaggy, Scooby-Doo is in grave danger. Dastardly's on his way here right now, and he won't stop until he gets him. Dastardly? We can't let that happen. Exactly! Now, take me to Scooby-Doo. As it turns out, I wasn't even the velociraptor's father. Anyhoo, there it is. The slaghoople. Brian, we found the last skull. Mission accomplished. Now, if you would give us a hand carrying it out, we'll take it back to our jet. Uh-uh-uh. The only way to take the slaghoople is to defeat the protector in battle. And that's me. You? Scooby, this is it. It's my hero moment. I can totally pound the crap out of this little guy. Doesn't sound heroic. Hey, you're on, but I think you're gonna need a few friends. Oh, I've got friends. And they do like a good show. All right now. Let's get our fight on! Come at me, little man. Little? Did you just call me little? No. He said big. I did call you little, pipsqueak. He said big squeak. You can call me... Captain Caveman! I know I'm small. It's a pituitary thing. Are you not entertained? Brian! Come on. Dynomutt is right. I'm not my dad. Scooby, help! What do I do? Use the suit thingies. Who's your captain? Captain Caveman! Hoorah! Huh? Huh. Hey. Wow, you're doing great. I almost hate to do this to you. Spin it to win it. I want my Raggy! Oh! You make a break for the skull. I'll go pick up Brian and Scooby. On it. Leave him alone. I love a challenge like I love dinosaur eggs. Over easy. - Uh... - Look out! Dang, those are some dope wheels. Whatever wheels are! - Scooby! - Raggy? - How'd you get here? - No, let me go first. - Scoob... - Where did that anachronistic van come from? Fred brought it, but that's not important. How'd he get the van to a prehistoric world hidden miles beneath the North Pole? I don't know. Why don't you ask Fred... Who's Fred? - ...right now, I need to... - Not me. Dick Dastardly! That's right. Your foolish friend - led me straight to you. - Oh, no. If you will excuse me, I have a treasure to collect. Raggy! Scooby! Oh, and I almost forgot to take out the rubbish. Whoa! - Whoa, nice catch! - Ahhh! - What's up? - Ta-ta! See you all in Athens. Oh! No, you won't. Because the only way out is with a jet. Well, good thing we have one. Oh, do you now? There's something about the way he said, "Do you?" and then laughed that makes me think he did something to our ship. I hate it when I'm right. We're lucky it doesn't happen often. Ugh. The primary engine is destroyed. The thrusters are intact, but they're way too small to launch the ship. So, we're stuck here? Well, maybe if your little buddy didn't lead the bad guy right to us... Leave Shaggy alone. Yeah, what kind of hero blames other people for his problems? Meet Brian. Hey, you shut your dog face. You shut your face-face. Because of you, Scooby-Doo has a first-class ticket to the dogpocalypse. Don't you point your finger at me. Well, don't double-point your finger at me. Maybe I'll triple-finger point at you. Then obviously I'm gonna quadruple-finger point at you. Ha! That's just a wave, dipstick. Hey, get off of him. He's the one that started it! Toxic masculinity. Stop! Stop it, all of you! It's my fault. I'm to blame. I let my own jealousy break me and Scooby up. I was afraid that with his new suit and his new team, things were gonna change. And they did change. But, like, that's okay. People can grow. But it doesn't mean that we're growing apart. Because the one thing that will never change is that Scooby-Doo is my best friend. Ten years ago, a little boy made a promise to a stray puppy that he'd never leave him, no matter what. And I'm gonna keep that promise. Now, it's time we stop this mustachioed menace from opening the gates to the underpass... - Underworld. - And letting loose the fearsome sippy-cup. - Cerberus. - So, what do you say - we get out of Middle-earth... - Copyright infringement. ...and go get my always-snacking, never-lacking, often-napping dog back! Who's with me? We are! Let's do this. Hey! That one! Thank you! Momma! Dad! What is that thing? Oh, I've waited! I've waited and waited for this very moment! Give me your paw. - No! - What? Back again like a bad oyster. Guys, supernatural transformation dead ahead. I thought you mewling millennials were done for good! Destroy those falcon fools! - Yes! - No! Whoa! No! I told you, you were the most important dog in the world. Now let me show you why. And the slipper fits. It's happening! It's finally happening! Uh-oh. Little more than I bargained for. If I were you, I'd run! Monster! Hurry! Daddy! You guys are alive! Scooby-Doo! Scooby! Yoo-hoo! Oh, thank goodness! The gang's finally back together. - Buddy, I never meant to... - I know. Me neither. All right. Time to take that 3-headed hound down to the pound. Is everyone accounted for? Whew. Well, that was my cardio for the day. Dynomutt, you saved us. Yeah, thank you! Yes, Dynomutt! At long last, my treasure! Oh, no. I'm too late. I've been searching for years, my friend. But I didn't make it in time. I'm sorry. I'm so, so sorry. There are so many things we never got to do together. Huh? You're alive? You're alive! You cantankerous canine, how could you do that to me? Rasm-Frasm. Stop! I'm not joking! Stop! Oh! I... I can't stay mad. You're alive! So, that's Cerberus. We've got to stop him before he gets into the city. Like, how? We fight monsters all the time. Remember the phantom sea squid at the haunted aquarium? That was a real estate developer with a couple of flashlights and a sound effects machine. This is the real deal. Right, Fred? Fred? Where's Fred? You shall be avenged. For the Mystery Machine! He's just attacking. I mean, are we supposed to be attacking? Huh? - Fred! - Come on. Hurry! Run! Sorry, gang. Never mess with another man's vehicle. We need a plan. Okay, like, Velma and Fred, you get to the gate and, uh, figure out how to close it. And we'll distract Cerberus. Great idea, guys. That was awesome! Smart. Yeah, we've been through a lot. We've grown. Brian! Go! Go, go, go, go, go! Now, Velma! Let's go! What do we do? Maybe he wants a Scooby Snack? I don't have any Scooby Snacks. I always have a spare. Sorry. And that's why I always have a spare spare. Scooby! I'm so weak. Nice doggy. I got this. Look out! Are you okay, little guy? Brian, what are you doing back here? I'm calling my dad. Hey! You don't need your dad. Yes, I do, all right? He's the hero. I'm not. I can't win this. So what? Look at Scooby and Shaggy! They're terrified, and they're taking on Cerberus! I'm terrified! Why are we taking on Cerberus? Well, in their own unique way. So you're saying it's heroic to be scared, and even to lose sometimes? Dude, this is it! This is my hero moment, my real hero moment. And it's my moment, too. My job is to have your back. So what do you say, Blue Falcon? Okay, now I'm crying. - Dyno! - Help! Scooby and Shaggy are about to be puppy chow. It's time for you to spread your wings and fly. You're right. This suit just makes me a hero on the outside. It's time to tap into the hero. In here. You know your suit has actual wings and can fly, right? Oh, right. The wings! Let's do this! I got a little too excited on the takeoff. This way, Scooby-Doo! Oh, Cerberus. Here, poochie-boy. This superhero stuff is fun! Whoa! Scooby! - I got you. - Ooh. Farewell, fools! Sayonara, suckers! Dastardly! We're rich! Rasm-Frasm. Money bath! Aw. He got his friend back. Daphne, focus. I wish I had that clue from Dastardly's ship. You mean this thing? Are you telling me you had that the whole time? Better late than never! This is awesome! Oh, good. They got him distracted. Hey, little guy. Remember at the bowling alley when you transformed into that thing? No. No, no, no. Not that scary thing. Huh. Looks like a riddle. Or a prophecy? "Two brothers bridge the earthly void. One man, one dog. The key employed." "One to open, two to close, a pair whose friendship forever grows." That's it! It takes one to open but two to lock. Okay. Before the creepy scorpion but after the scary pin. Yeah. Yeah, that's it! But there's a catch. Incoming! We've gotta get Cerberus closer to the gate! On it! Here, doggy, doggy, doggy. Man, looks like we just spared the world! Bowling puns. This is so us. Okay, so how do we lock that puppy up? What? One of you has to hold the gates shut here... While one of you locks them from inside the Underworld. What? No! There has to be another way. Right, Velma? Alexander the Great built these gates to be locked only by him and his dog Peritas. As the last descendant of Peritas, Scooby has to do it. But the prophecy says he needs his best friend to help him. That's you, Shaggy. There's no other way. I'm the key. I'll go. It says one of us had to be on the inside, but it doesn't say which one. No! Buddy, back when we were kids, you saved me. Now it's my turn. No. Don't. Raggy, wait! No! Raggy. Scoob. You're the best friend I could ever ask for. And you always will be. Raggy. Are we missing something? "A pair whose friendship forever grows." Could it mean something else? I think it means that Scoob and Shaggy's friendship will live on whether they're together or not. But... ...why would Alexander make a gate that would separate him from his best friend forever? He must have built a way out. Uh... Guys. It's Alexander the Great. Look at this inscription. It's a message from him. "Our bond will never break or bend..." "So, my friend, it's time to return to your home." Maybe Scooby should give it a try. Raggy, you promised you'd never leave. Come home. Raggy? Zoinks! I guess friendship really did save the day. Raggy! Scooby-Doo! I love you guys! You gave us quite a scare, Shaggy. Well, it takes more than a 3-headed monster to keep me away from my best bud. Tank, empath, brain. I finally figured out what you guys are. You're the heart of Mystery, Inc. Ow, ow, oh. Ow! Sorry. Metal tongue. Shoulda thought that through. Put me down, you traitorous tin cans! Rasm-Frasm. Stupid robots. Time to pay for your crimes, Dick Dastardly. Or is it? Simon Cowell? Wow, that is a solid impersonation. Thank you. I also played Rum Tum Tugger in my secondary school's production of Cats. This makes no sense. How could he have time to judge the world's greatest talent shows and build a giant airship? Dick Dastardly? Drat. No one ever goes for the double unmasking. You are coming with us. I would've gotten away with it if it weren't for you mismatched meddling miscreants! Congratulations, you two. You just saved the world. How do you feel? Hungry. Oh, man. It's perfect. Wait, Shaggy, where's the DJ you hired? Like, they'll be here any minute. "They"? Surprise! You know we wouldn't miss your grand opening. DJ Blue Falcon! And that is how you make an entrance. Good job, Keith. Thank you, BF! I'm so happy you're back. You know, I'm proud of him, but he couldn't have done this without us. I know. I am so gonna need a raise. Hello? Hello, Mystery Inc.? There's been a mysterious sighting in San Pedro. Residents report seeing a phantom tuna trawler and the ghost of an old sea captain. G-g-g-ghost? Looks like we're on the case. Let's hit it. Hey, Dusty! Watch the shop, please. What do you say, buddy? Let's Scooby-Dooby-Doo it!
