Four suspects were arrested today by the Athens police but there is no confirmation yet that the arrests were made in connection to the scalpel murders. The third victim of this terrifying series of surgical slayings was discovered last night. The Greek Prime Minister announced...

You see, sir, working in the Middle East for five years was sort of a divorce from reality and civilization for me. To find myself plugged into the Madison Avenue scene might upset my balance. This is what I really need, a decompression chamber where one half of the brain thinks western while the other half can think in terms of five centuries ago. On the other hand, I'm an excellent account executive, but I know a lot about copy. I speak English, French, Italian, I work hard for my money. Anything else you need to know is in my resume. (peaceful piano music) (chatter in foreign language) - Just exactly, the camera goes all the way there, okay? Spread out. James? - Now, on business matters, I'm proud to inform you that I managed to get everything ready on time, and in return, you promise not to ask how much we're spending. Do you absolutely, definitely, honestly swear not to ask? - Yeah. - Good, I'll start the shooting now. Alright, you guys, let's get the show on the road! Action! (bleeping) (upbeat pop music) - [Man] No. It can't be. (sensual music) Not Mary Anne. Not my Mary Anne. - [Employee] I personally like the new four-color brochures, but the client thinks different. He said though that he'll be happy with them if you're happy. What do you think? - Well, I don't know, Olympic Holidays is bringin' 100,000 people into this country every summer. You can do better than this. That's it for today. It has to grab you. - Mr. Ratcliff, this is for you. - Great, thank you. Did you arrange payment for the girls, Claire? Claire? Claire! - No, I didn't. It's the sixth day of the bank strike. - It's also the eighth day of the bus strike. Second week of the taxi strike. Third month of gas rationing. 32nd year of my life on this planet, so what? - So, happy birthday! Do you want me to sing? - Buy me a Cartier watch instead. - Do you wanna come over tonight and celebrate? - Who else is invited? - Just you. - I don't know, Claire. You probably just want me for my body. - I don't know, Jonathon, you're probably right! - In that case, I'll come. - Good. Be there at nine.

Take it easy. You're in a hospital. You took a real bad fall and they, uh, they found you unconscious, but you're gonna be okay. You're gonna be okay. - Are you sure, absolutely nothing? - No. Everything's black. Just black. - Alright, let's try again. (dark electronic music) - I've been away from the office for an entire week, Claire. - Screw the office. - While you're at it, why don't you include the tests and the doctors? - I know you feel horrible about this. - Confused is more like it. - They're confused, too. They have absolutely no idea why you're blind. They act like you're-- - Claire. This bed is killing me, I wanna go home. - Tomorrow, they said. - No more tests? - That's what they said, I don't trust them, they... we'll give this a few days, and then I'm taking you back home. I'd feel safer in New York. - Look, Ma, no eyes. - You're doing fine, in a couple of days, you'll be cruising around here just like you used to. - Easy for you to say. - You'll be alright. - Sure. I'll be dandy. She never got over it, her family committed her, I never even saw her again. Until a couple of days ago. At least, I think it's her. I can't tell. You know what the hardest part was? I couldn't help her. I just couldn't. - I'm not giving you up, Jon. - I don't want you to. But this is something that I just, I have to do. For me. You, you're mad, aren't you? (dark music) - No. I'm hurt. And I'm scared and I'm too god damn stupid to cover it up. (Jon sighs) - You know somethin', it's pretty damn dark in here. I'm not gonna take it. Mm-hm. You know what I'm gonna do today? I'm gonna go out. If thousands of other blind people can do it, I can do it. (moody electronic music) (train approaches) - Oh, one! A two! A three! A four! (men sing over each other) - Hello? - [Man] Hello. - Where are you? (men laugh) Over there? - No, over here. - No, here! - Here. - Look, I don't want any trouble, just show me back to the-- - Sure! But it'll cost you. - Show us some money and we might show you the way home! - Hey, don't point that fucking stick at me, man. - [Man] Silly boy. - Or I might just bust your head in! (thud) - Now what you made him do. You've annoyed him! (thuds) (grunts) (thuds) (grunts) Oh, lovely, lovely, lovely, lovely, lovely! - (laughs) A blind man shouldn't have so much money. Alright, I'm gonna tell you where the exit is, so you can get out of here and give the police a good description of the arseholes who kicked the shit out of you. The exit is this way. (train approaches) - Come on, come on, let's go! - If you'd like to give us any more, you can find us here any night between the hours of 11 and 12, okay? Goodbye! Goodbye! Excuse me, is there a doctor in the house? - You're not going out alone again. - Says who? - Says me. That little stunt you pulled last night was suicide. I'm not gonna let you kill yourself. Even if your condition is permanent, blind is better than dead, for Christ sake. - That's a matter of opinion. - What happened last night, Jon? - I told you. I fell down. - I want the truth. - Come on, Jon. Talk to me. You talk to your god damn plants, why can't you talk to me? - Plants don't talk back. (machine bleeps) - [Employee] Hi, Jon, it's Brian from the office. I just called to say that the US embassy has no record of Rachel Boyet or Mary Anne Perry. If you can, give me some details, I could try them again. Call me when you feel like it, eh? Bye. - Thanks. - You're welcome. For what? - For coming with me. - Hey, why didn't you bring a drink for me? - [Model] I only have two hands. - You want a sip? - Yeah, I do. - Here's your coffee. - Thanks for the ride, pal. - Cut the crap. - Heavy slang for a proper Brit. What did you come up with? - Well, it seems Barnard and the others run a pretty tight outfit. The Hedra Society is definitely a temple for high-tech devotees. - And Steiger? - Two-time Nobel Prize winner. Top-notch brain surgeon and a good husband. - Meaning? - Meaning I pulled a few social strings here and there and got through to his wife, Stephanie. - And? - Steiger will see you on Sunday. (moody electronic music) (background chatter) - I checked your medical tests from the hospital, worked up by highly qualified physicians. Everything's negative. You should not be blind. Your optic nerve doesn't appear to be damaged. The sheathing's intact. Everything appears to be functional, and should be. Except for the possibility of blindness induced by trauma. - So, if there's no clinical case, there's no cure, right? - Well, that depends. If, for example, I were dealing with someone who was recently blinded and whose optic nerve were irreversibly damaged, I might just possibly be able to help him. Alright, this demonstration will give you an idea of the principals involved. Some 20 years ago, a young amateur in the united States found a way for deaf people to hear music. What he did, using electrodes, he connected some secondary auditory nerves of a deaf subject to a sound source. Now, the music we're about to play will not be audible, but will come directly from that tape deck to the electrodes on your arm. Uh, Andrew, would you mind? (moody piano music) (chuckles) You're not hearing things, the music you just experienced was transmitted directly through your nervous system to the auditory center of your brain. In other words, we bypassed your ears. Well, this basic concept. I've devised a method to do the same thing with sight, and this is what I've come up with. - A tape recorder? - Not quite. This little unit, which for obvious reasons is concealed in a plain commercial case, is a mass of printed circuits and computer electronics. - What does it do? - Well, put simply, it combines a sonar device with a visual synthesizer. - That's not quite simple enough. - Alright, it's like the sonar used in submarines or even some self-focusing cameras. An electronic signal is sent out from a source. Now, as soon as it hits an object, it bounces back to the source again. This little unit does essentially the same thing. It sends out a constant inaudible signal. Now, when that signal hits any objects near around you, it bounces off them and returns to the unit again. And that signal is then fed into a computer chip which measures the size and the distance of those objects. That information is then transmitted directly to the visual synthesizer which processes it instantly. And it relays the image directly to the sight center of your brain, it's more or less like looking through the eyes of a computer. - Unbelievable. - We have a problem, however. It's never been tested on a human subject. - I'd like to try. - I want you to be very sure, because once I perform the operation, it will destroy any chance whatsoever of you ever regaining your eyesight again. Can you make this decision? (suspenseful electronic music) (machine bleeps rhythmically) (air hisses) I'll use the laser to cut an 0.3 millimeter hole in the skull. I will then implant the positive electrode plate. Um, are we ready? - [Nurse] Ready, doctor. - I wanna emphasize again, Jon, that CompuVision is still only in its experimental stage. There's no way that we can imply that it even replaces normal sight. First I'll teach you how to use the main unit, which is actually three units in one. The forward button activates the unit. It takes a couple of seconds for the initial feed of information, then the computer takes over. The rewind button activates a cassette inside the unit. All signals you receive can be recorded and played back. In other words, you'll be able to keep a visual record of what you see and re-examine it at a later time. Finally, the volume control, which activates an advanced and very powerful sound amplifier. Now, the positive contact between this unit, your nervous system and your brain, is made via the minute platinum-electrode plate which we implanted in your skull. Now, I'm gonna turn the unit to its ready position, and I want you to let me know how you feel. (device whines) (dark atmospheric tones) Good. Now, as I turn the unit to its on position, you'll begin to see outlines forming a computerized grid giving you the exact layout of this room. Your journey begins, Jon Ratcliff. Good luck. (moody electronic tones) (rhythmic bleeps) I trust that you now have a complete view of the room. Ah. I forgot to mention something. One of the limitations of this first model is its sensitivity to fast head movement. The headset, which sends out sonar signals, takes the place of your eyes. Now, turn slowly and give the unit time to adjust to the field of vision. And be careful around windows. The sonar will not penetrate glass, no matter how transparent. Remember, a window is still a solid surface to the sonar. There's one more limitation. You won't be able to see precise details. Generally, you'll see people and things in outline form only. Um... Of course, you won't be able to read, either. But if you get close enough, you'll be able to see faces, or anything else that's three-dimensional. - That's good enough for me, doctor. - You must also remember that prolonged use of the unit is not recommended. We're dealing here with an electrical stimulation of the brain which could prove damaging if overdone. I would suggest an initial trial period of no more than two hours and then, only in 15 minute blocks of time. Otherwise, you could experience synapse dysfunction. - Meaning? - Petit mal seizures, blackouts, even collapse. See what tolerance you develop, we'll play it by ear. Varies from brain to brain. - You're the boss. (dramatic electronic music) - I don't think so. - Hello. - So, why didn't you tell me? - I wasn't sure how you'd react. - I wouldn't have said anything. - There are times when I think you are the ideal companion. - How about when you're sober? - My condition doesn't matter. I've always known when you were faking it. Like right now? - What're you talking about? - You're worried. Hey. I can't see your face well enough to prove it. But I know you're trying to hide your concern. Don't fret, Claire, I know what I'm doing, believe me. - Eat, your fish is getting cold. (water hisses and crackles) (phone rings) (phone rings) (phone rings) (phone rings) (phone rings) - Okay, let's see. The computer unit feeds electronic signals to my brain, right? Right. The game feeds electronic signals to the TV screens also, right? So, if I'm correct, I should be able to feed the game directly into my clever little brain. (intense electronic tones) (intense video game chirps and bleeps) (dark electronic music) (rhythmic thuds and chirps) - well, what a night that was. (muffled chatter) Ta-da! Not bad for the money, eh? What do you think? - It's great.

(sighs) Hi, Lisa. Yeah. Terrible. Listen, I can't go tonight. I'm gonna take a sleeping pill and go right to bed. Just really hard. The usual. Started on me right away. Yeah. Listen, can I tell you about it tomorrow? It's been a really long day. Mm-hm. Yeah, you too. Bye.

I even opened a new account. (rhythmic thuds and chirps) (moody orchestral music) - I just don't see what good it would do to go to the police, I don't have anything to tell them. - You've got the tape. - Which I can only play back up here. - Maybe you can get some detail from the tape. Maybe give the cops a lead. - Have you ever dealt with the local police? - Come on, Jon. If that tape can help stop this maniac, use it. What you know may save somebody's life. Oh, and Jon, if you do find anything, don't play detective. Let the police handle it. (woman screams) (hurried footsteps) (woman screams) - Come on! (distorted speech) (high-pitched speech) - [High-Pitched Voice] Right there, right there. (moody orchestral music) (garbled speech) - [woman] That's the hotel, that's the hotel. That's the hotel, that's hotel. - Well, I'll be damned. This tape is for Dr. Steiger, in case I can't tell him myself. This is only a precaution, doctor, because I don't know how far I can go experimenting with this unit. And by the way, I think it's a fantastic machine. Alright, down to business. The other night, I was walking on the streets and I heard someone scream inside a building. There had been a murder. I just replayed my CompuVision tape. I think that the killer was driving a car with a bad engine. It made a distinct sound, real noisy. That's not much in itself, except I'm positive I've heard, maybe even seen that car before, the problem is, I can't remember where or when. It must be buried in my subconscious or something. Anyway, the point is, I overdosed the other day when I connected my ComputVision unit directly into a video game machine. I went into some kind of seizure. Collapsed for quite a few hours. When I started coming to, I had a strange experience. Something I had forgotten about years ago. I saw myself at four years old, on a day I fell and twisted my ankle. What if the video game acted as some kind of trigger on subconscious memories? What if the overdose brought them back to my conscious mind? I don't know how dangerous this thing can be, Doctor Steiger but I'm going to try. Somebody's life could depend on me remembering where I heard that car. This recorder is voice-activated, Doctor Steiger, so it'll record every sound I make. If I do make any more sounds after this. (somber electronic music) (video game chirps and bleeps) (intense video game chirps and bleeps) (phone rings) I'm not here right now, I'll probably be out all day. At the sound of the insufferable beep, please leave your name and number, I'll get back to you as soon as I can. (machine bleeps) - Hello, darling. (chuckles) I just called to remind you that I'm going to that cocktail party for a while. Oh, I don't want to, but I have to. So, when I get to your place, I expect to find you in bed, ready and very willing. (suspenseful music) (distorted electronic tones) - It worked, Dr. Steiger. I saw the car, a taxi cab and the killer. Not his face, but I saw him with surgical gloves. He even had... Jesus. Rachel. (door slams) (car engine churns) (car engine churns) Come on. (car engine churns) (car engine churns) Come on!

You think it's some kind of joke or something? - Who's that, David? Who are you talking to? - Some prick's playin' games. - [Jon] Games? You mean like putting on surgical gloves and cutting people up? You mean those kinds of games? - I'm coming out, David! - Don't move, Rachel, you're safe over there. - Who is that? - It doesn't matter. Just stay where you are. This maniac has a scalpel in his hand. He was gonna use that on you. - He's lying, Rachel. - Am I? Listen to me, Rachel. Good ol' Dr. David isn't a doctor. Maybe he had some fantasy about being one when he was a kid, but it never worked out. Know what David really does, Rachel? He drives a taxi, not a real taxi. He just drives it to pick up his victims. He's sick, Rachel. He wants to hurt you. - I'm gonna cut you in half, you son of a bitch. - [Jon] well, go ahead, doctor, try. But you've gotta find me first. The master switch is next to the entrance. Go for it. - David! What the hell's going on? - [Jon] Feel more comfortable in the light, Dave? I thought so. I thought I'd make it easy for you. You have to find me, Dave. I've seen you kill. I know all about you. (gate slams) (suspenseful atmospheric music) (grate clangs) (David chokes) (switch clicks) (peaceful piano music) You can come out now, Rachel. It's all over. - Who are you?

Hi, gorgeous outline. - [Claire] Thank god you're okay. - [Jon] why are you breathing so hard? - Because I ran all the way! - [Jon] The problem with you is you worry too much, hm? - What happened? - The girl is alright. - And you? - I'm okay. I'll tell you about it. Now that it's over, I can tell you all about it. Can you drive us back? - Hell yes. (peaceful electronic music) - [Jon] Good. (chuckles) But be careful.
