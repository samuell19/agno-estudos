So you got hot-headed and struck the man with a crowbar, eh? Well young man, maybe you can cool off in about 90 days. Next case. If the court please. A life-or-death matter, Judge. Listen, Mary F. You've got to marry me. Perry, I've known you since you peddled papers in this town twenty years ago. But I have no desire to become your wife. Of course not, you old heartbreaker. This is the lucky lady. Judge, meet Miss Della Street. My ex-secretary. For sentimental reasons I'd like you to tie the knot. Court is adjourned for a ten-minute recess. Right this way, Perry. Come along, you poor child. Say. Are you with Mr Mason's party? Am I with his party? My dear boy, I am Mr Mason's chief legal advisor. Drake is the name. Spudsy Drake. That don't impress me, son. You're wanted on the phone. Oh? Hello? How is that? Mrs Simpson? No, no, Mrs Simpson. Mr Mason has gone to Pinehurst Lodge. I now pronounce you man and wife. Kiss her, Perry, Go on. It's legal now. Thank you, Judge. Can we have a picture of Mrs Mason? Sit her right on the desk there. Thanks. - Stand alongside her, Perry. Thank you. As the best man it is my privilege to kiss the bride. Help yourself, boys. Perry is buying. What will you do Perry if a case comes up while you are away? My son, if it's a criminal case I don't want it. I have retired from the practice of criminal law. Many times. - I mean it. I've promised Della to become a sober filer of briefs. No more excitement or danger. Can't you just see him with his spectacles and briefcase? The car is ready, boss. So long, Judge. You're a great guy. I'll never forget your kindness, Mary F. Goodbye, Perry. Goodbye, Mrs Mason. - Goodbye. You know, my dear. I still owe Perry for the last newspaper he delivered to me .. When he was just so high. Don't worry. I haven't forgotten that nickel you owe. And I am going to collect someday. - See that you do. Goodbye. - Goodbye, Judge. Perry. Even if we don't approve, good luck. Be brave, Della. Alright, Spudsy. Pinehurst Lodge. Send me a postcard. Good luck. The bride's bouquet. You know, whoever catches it .. Goodbye. Good luck. Take your shoes off and throw them. Go on. Here's what we do for the bride and groom on their honeymoon at Pinehurst. We telephone Pinehurst. Then we send the fire department at midnight. And the village constable at noon. And at four I swear it's a phony marriage. Spudsy. Make a left turn at the next corner. We are going back to the apartment. What about Pinehurst? Yeah. What about Pinehurst? Unfortunately they have telephones and we have friends. You mean those guys back there? What could they do? - Plenty. I pity the poor residents of Pinehurst this night. Thanks, Spudsy. Wait a minute, darling. As my secretary you walk into my parlor. But the judge says it is legal now. Boss, come here. Excuse me. - Make yourself right at home. Boss, you don't have to worry anymore about sleepless nights. Look at this. Sleeping tablets. - Sure. Got them from your doctor. He guarantees you'll sleep. Those are plenty powerful. Better try a couple of them tonight. Tonight? Tonight? Why you chump. Say, don't I even get a drink on my wedding night? Right away, darling. Hello. Are you Perry Mason? No. No, ma'am. Well, the other woman. Stay right where you are. Haven't you heard? Mr Mason isn't taking criminal cases any longer. Bitters for the bride? No bitters, thank you. No bitters. Which is the one without the bitters, Mr Mason? Hello. I am sorry, Della. My name is Mrs Eva Stewart. I've tried to reach you all day. I need legal advice. This is hardly a time for legal matters, Mrs Stewart. However, I would suggest a disarmament conference. Here is five thousand dollars, Mr Mason. You will get more. Now you're coming with me. Well, if it's a criminal case. You see .. We'll discuss that later. Now, you are coming with me. Della, do you mind writing out a receipt for Mrs Stewart? Well, there's nothing like the peace and happiness of married life. 'Received from Mrs Eva Stewart'. 'Five thousand dollars on account'. Sign on the dotted line, Mr Mason. Her finger seems slightly nervous. Now you have an attorney bought and paid for can you consider putting away the .. Not until I get you in a cab. Get your hat. After you. Goodbye, darling. Don't mind me. I am only the bride. Della, angel. I will be back in an hour. Goodbye. Give my love to all the folks down Mrs Stewart's way. We are on the way to Spicy Bits. Then the reason is a case of blackmail? - Yes. Last night a candidate for the legislature .. Was seen at the Beechwood Inn with a certain woman. There was a raid. I read about it. - Right. The candidate's name is Peter Milnor. Spicy Bits is the only paper that knows he was there. And they go to press the day after tomorrow. Peter Milnor? You want to keep his name out of print. Is that it? I'm looking out for myself. Then you were the 'certain woman' who was with him? The paper must never know that. Understand? Never. Who are you anyway? - I told you who I am. Mrs Eva Stewart. Well, that name will do for the time being. Well, here was I. Happy as a secretary. Deserted as a wife. There, there, Della. Don't you worry. You just trust old Spudsy. I'll take care of you. But Spudsy. After all .. Look. The money. You are burning his fee. Well, Spudsy. I've always wanted to light a cigarette with a thousand-dollar bill. Hello darling. Well, I ditched the lunatic and I will be home in five minutes. The five thousand goes back as soon as she calls me. You think it does? Listen, angel. You have got to take the case. Spudsy burned up the money. Every teeny-weeny bit of it. What? Wait until I .. Ah well. Never mind, precious. I'll take the case and wash it up in an hour. See you later. It says 'Private' on that gate. Can't you read? If I couldn't I would be working on Spicy Bits. I want to see Frank Locke. I am .. I know who you are, rat. Wait here. That shyster Perry Mason is outside. He wants to see you. - Perry Mason, huh? Send him in. - Okay, boss. Wait outside, boys. So I go, Frank? I think you had better, dear. Goodbye, honey. Goodbye. I am Perry Mason. I have only five minutes to talk turkey, Mr Locke. I know who you are. Go on. You go to press the day after tomorrow. You're going to feature a certain story. I want to keep that story out of print. Who much will it cost me? Spicy Bits is not a blackmailing sheet. However, we do sell space to advertisers. What's on your mind? Peter Milnor. Oh. Just a minute. He is going to talk. Get it down. Are you representing Peter Milnor or the woman that was with him? What woman? If you know her name, Mason, and are willing to talk .. Spicy Bits will go on the paying end. Tell me who is the real owner of this blackmailing rag. And maybe we can make a trade. Do you smoke it or take it in the arm? I am the owner. Listen, Locke. You fellows have run a blackmailing sheet long enough. And I just want you to know that I am starting after you right now. Very well. In the meantime would you mind going? Not at all. So long. No hard feelings. That is what you think. One moment please. A rose. Not as lovely as you are, my dear. But still, a rose. For me? [ Buzzer ] Yes, Mr Locke? What was it you said about roses? Just skip it. You are sure you're from the district attorney's office, Mr O'Flaherty? If you doubt me Mr O'Toole, you've surely got a phone. Well, here are all the file numbers, Mr O'Flaherty. Alright, Mr O'Toole. Check up on number 6298. 6298? 6-2-9-8. 'George C. Belter'. '556 Elmwood'. That is him, Mr O'Flaherty. And he is a millionaire stockbroker. Yes. Well, it seems he has some other interests on the side. Goodbye, O'Toole. Mr Belter is occupied. Did I make myself clear, sir? Quite clear. Thank you. Hello you and what are you doing here? I am Mrs Veite. Mr Belter's housekeeper. Who is she? That is my daughter, Norma. Good. Hello. My name is Perry Mason. What is yours? - Carl Griffin. Have a drink? Thanks. You are not George Belter? - No. Belter is my uncle. He is upstairs in his study. Have you a gun? No. Why? Well, most people who call on my uncle brandish weapons. He must be delightful. Going out? - Yes. You know your way upstairs? - No. Through the doorway and take the stairway on your right. Thanks. I will. You don't have to hold my arm. I can find the way out. Sorry, Mr Garwood. But Mr Belter gave me his orders. You can tell Mr Belter that he'll regret his treatment of me this evening. Very well, Mr Garwood. Good evening, Mr Belter. Who are you? I am an attorney representing Peter Milnor. Peter Milnor? - Yes. In case you don't know it, your weekly Spicy Bits .. Is trying to blackmail him. You are either drunk or crazy or both. Now get out. I'll get out when I've said what I have to say. No-one in this town knows you own Spicy Bits. You are respected as a millionaire stockbroker. Well, if your paper publishes anything about my client .. I will rip off your mask and expose you. Digley, isn't this the man you threw out not ten minutes ago? Yes, sir. Well, throw him out again. I didn't know you were busy, George. I'm sorry. - Don't mind this person. He is just a shyster lawyer who is leaving in a hurry. Listen, Mr Belter .. - This way, sir. That's for catching me off balance the last time. Now listen, Belter. I had decided to give you a break but I've changed my mind. You print one word about my client in your sheet .. And you will go to jail for twenty years. The trouble with you, Mason. Is that you keep singing the same song. Now, for the last time, get out. - Alright. I've said all I've got to say. Goodnight, Mr Belter. Goodnight, Digley. Goodnight. Goodnight, Mrs Belter. Eva. Come here. Where is the five thousand that was in the safe? The five thousand? I suppose you're going to tell me that a little bird took it. What on earth are you talking about? The five thousand dollars that you stole. Also. This curious receipt. Perry Mason's handkerchief. Yes. I went through your bag. You have messed things beautifully. You went to Perry Mason and gave him a fictitious name and a false lead. He came out here pretending to represent Peter Milnor. Peter Milnor? Yes. But he didn't know that I had Milnor here this evening myself. As a matter of fact they passed each other on the stairway. You had Peter Milnor here? Trying to prove what I suspected. That you were with him last evening at the Beechwood Inn. He wouldn't tell me. But you have answered the question yourself. Spicy Bits? Mr Locke? Mister B calling. Frank. Mason was just here. He traced me down in jig time, didn't he. Sure. She was with Milnor alright. Go ahead. All over the front page of Thursday's issue. 'Candidate for legislature a homewrecker'. Sure. Use her name. She'll get used to the publicity when I get her in divorce court. Tell him not to print a word of that. Go ahead and shoot. It won't do you any good. I changed my will today. You think you are clever, don't you. You've gotten away with murder for years. You're not the only one who can get away with it. [ Gunshot! ] Norma, what was that? Hello, Della. Hello darling. Gesundheit. Thanks. Spudsy, some glasses. The honeymoon has officially begun. You're home early, darling. Have a heavy day at the office? Yes, dear. Hmm, rosebuds. Perry, you are an angel. And a bottle on one side for the bride. And a bottle on the other for equilibrium. [ Telephone ] Mr Mason is at Pinehurst Lodge with his bride. Hello? Mr Mason is at Pinehurst Lodge with his bride. Who? Mrs Belter? Mrs Belter? The young woman with the five thousand. I thought you said her name was Stewart. Hello, Mrs Belter. What's the matter? Do you want to donate another five thousand? Perry Mason, you are lying. Mrs Belter. What was the name you gave when you called on me earlier this evening? Eva Stewart. What's that again? I must see you at once. You can't. I'm at Pinehurst Lodge with my bride. What's that? I said I think someone shot my husband. Yes. Shot him. Very well. I will be right there. Where are you calling from? Right. Spudsy, my boots and saddle. I am terribly sorry, darling. I'll be back in an hour. I swear I will. It's alright, my sweet. I haven't touched my mending. And Junior's socks must be darned before school opens. Poor dear Junior. And you can be darned too, you big chump. Oh, Della. Perry, please turn out that light. I want to see if you lie, my dear. Talk and talk fast. Well. Just after you left our house tonight. I went back to my room. Suddenly I heard voices. Angry voices coming from my husband's study. I crept down the hall to listen. There was a shot and the sound of a falling body. What time was that? A little bit before nine. Then I heard a man running down the stairs. Perry, I am so frightened. Come, come Mrs Belter. You forget. I am a married man. Come on in. You didn't like him, did you? Alright. You'd better stay outside and watch the stairs. Let me know if anyone comes up. [ Telephone ] Hello? Spudsy. Got a pencil? Get this down. 0.32 calibre Colt automatic. Number: A .. 2-5-4-2-3-4. Search the police records right away. There's a chance it may be listed. Say, boss. Do you know it's ten o'clock at night and I've only lifted a hundred 25 times. Now you lift 175 down to the police station right away. I'll call you in an hour. Tell Mrs Mason I will be there shortly. Mrs Belter. Come in and close the door. You heard but one shot? - That's right. Do you think it could possibly be suicide? Hmm. Sure. Have you any idea who was here arguing with your husband? Well. The other man spoke quite clearly. Have you ever heard the other man's voice before? I think so. Do you know who it was? Yes. Alright. Don't be so mysterious. I am your lawyer. Who was it? You know who it was. How would I know who it was? Because it was you, Perry. So that's the kind of playmate you are. I won't tell anyone. Ever. Alright. How did I kill him? And why? I don't want to be cruel, Perry. But .. After you had the argument with my husband. You returned up the back stairs. You killed him, Perry. That is why I ran to the drugstore to telephone. I wanted to give you time to get home so you would have an alibi. You are a liar, Mrs Belter. Now, I am going to tell you what to do. First, you will permanently forget the pipedream about hearing me in this room. But what are we going to do? If Locke prints that Beechwood Inn story suspicion may even shift to me. Will you let me handle Frank Locke? I do trust you, Perry. Well, that is fine. Now listen. I want forty-five minutes for investigation. You go to your room and keep quiet. Don't say a word to a soul. And don't call the police until you hear from me. I'll be back as soon as I can. But I tell you Mr Milnor has gone away. Good evening, Mr Milnor. Have you heard? You are in quite a jam. I don't know who you are and you must excuse me. I am just leaving. - Where is your phone? Would you mind telling me who you are? I am Perry Mason. Your attorney. In your trial for your life. For the murder of George C. Belter. Hey, what's the idea? Oh. Hello, Mr Mason. Yeah. They had a record on that automatic. It belongs to a guy named Peter Mitchell. Peter Milnor, eh? Well, he did have a motive for killing Belter. Good work, Spudsy. Tell Mrs Mason I'll be home in an hour. Well, Mr Milnor. About two hours ago. George C. Belter was murdered with a 0.32 automatic. A man's voice was heard in his study and your gun was used. My gun? Not my gun. You are a liar. It's in your name. That gun is registered under the name of Pete Mitchell. Who is Pete Mitchell? - Well .. Pete Mitchell doesn't exist. They can't trace that gun to me. That's where you're mistaken, Mr Milnor. I saw you at the Belter home earlier in the evening. And I heard you talking to the butler. Now, the first thing I want is a campaign contribution. All that I have is .. Is $2,000 worth of travellers checks. - I can cash them. Hello. Fairview sanatorium? Hell doctor. I didn't recognise your voice. Listen. Send an ambulance to 2452 Green. Yes. Just around the corner. Algernon P. Fortescue. Nothing serious. A nervous breakdown. Right. Now, why did you kill him? I didn't. I swear I didn't. I was there earlier. You're right about that. He tried to pump me about his wife. But I didn't go back. If Frank Locke prints that Beechwood Inn story .. The police will get to you pronto. There is the motive. A fight over Belter's wife. Digley the butler saw you there. - I was there as Mr Garwood. That was Belter's idea. Well, if they get you on the carpet .. You will be Milnor, not Garwood. Then, you've got to keep that story out of print. Are you telling me? How well do you know Frank Locke? We've got to get something on that bird. Belter had something on him. Mrs Belter told me about it. He was in some trouble down south. There was a woman mixed up in it. - Yes. Well, that is fine. Down south is only a thousand miles as the crow flies but .. I am no crow. Mr Algernon P. Fortescue. May I assist you? But I .. - Your litter awaits. Come, come, my boy. You are a sick man. Lie down Mr Fortescue until your troubles blow over. Out, my men. But listen. I .. - Take it easy, Mr Fortescue. Everything will be alright, sir. Police headquarters? Homicide squad please. You can run along to bed, son. I won't be needing anything. Hello, homicide squad? Perry Mason speaking. I want to report a murder. At 556 Elwood Avenue. George C. Belter. The Belter murder, Mr Mason? That was reported not thirty minutes ago by Mrs Belter herself. Oh? Well, thank you very much. Well, it looks like protecting Mrs Belter is going to prove difficult. On second thoughts my lad I'll have that drink of Scotch you offered. Qu?? Scotch? Scotch. Oh, yes. Me too, sir. Tag the gun and the cartridge. Sure there are no fingerprints? Not a one. The ballistic expert says the gun was fired twice. Ah, he is crazy. - Mason. Good morning, Riley. Officer Blair. And Mr Belter. As I live and die. Morning, gentlemen. I thought you were at Pinehurst. - Haven't you heard? I am representing Mrs Belter. Mrs George C. Belter. Now look here, Perry. What have you been up to? Up to Pinehurst. Excuse me. I seem to have caught a cold. But it's lovely up there, boys. The verdant vales, the running brooks. And whippoorwills, Wilbur. You would love the whippoorwills. Those darn slippery floors. You will find this to be Carl Griffin. Nephew of the late Mr Belter. Hey, Griffin. Come on, snap out of it. Griffin. Your uncle has been murdered. Hey, Griffin. You are drunk. No, Griffin. You are the one that is drunk. Murdered? Did you say murdered? - Yes. Murdered. Then it was that woman who did it. His wife. That was a thoughtless remark, Mr Griffin. Shut up Perry. Beat it. I'll just look round a bit. You may proceed with your usual questioning. Griffin, come on. Wake up, Griffin. What makes you think Mrs Belter killed her husband? I don't think any such thing. That's what you said. - I didn't say any such thing. I repeat: you are drunk. [ Telephone ] Yes? It's time for Mrs Belter's hot milk. Right away. Yes, ma'am. Delighted. Say, isn't it true that the butler is kinda sweet on you? Have you seen him? He sleeps above the study, doesn't he? No, sir. The servants all sleep in the east wing. You stop badgering my daughter. You heard the shot. You know you did. You're lying. No, sir. The first thing I knew was when I woke up. There was a man standing by the bed looking down at me. A detective. Come on, sister. You must have some idea about the murder. She hasn't got any ideas. That would bear repeating. I get to you in a minute, sourpuss. Well, it won't do you any good. I am a servant and I see nothing and I hear nothing. That's the girl. Hold the line. Say, who are you? - I am the Sandman. No. The only other caller was a Mr Garwood. Who left in quite a huff. Of course, I told you about Mr Mason. Are you sure you didn't hear a shot? No, sir. I retired earlier. Just after Mr Mason left. A few minutes before nine. Say. Who are you? Just working my way through college. Yes. Uncle George liked me and he didn't like his wife. Look here, Griffin. This is a murder case and you're playing 'button, button, who's got the button'. How about the comment you made about the murder to the effect that Mrs Belter .. I don't remember that comment, Sergeant. And I certainly didn't mean it. Maybe you didn't mean it my alcoholic friend. But you certainly managed to drive home a thought. That will do for you, Perry. You can keep quiet or get out. Okay, Sergeant. But remember. You can't convict a woman until she is proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. I shouldn't have let you in here in the first place. Now you can get out. I am going, Sergeant. You forget. This is my wedding night. I will be at Pinehurst if you want to reach me. Mrs Belter. I'm ready to talk now, Sergeant. - You sure you feel alright, Mrs Belter? Quite alright. Now hold it just a second, Mrs Belter. That's fine. Thanks. Now, about that voice you heard. I told you I thought I recognised it. Another man's voice. And my husband was having the argument. Just before the shot. Yes, of course. Well. Perhaps I shouldn't. But .. It was Perry Mason's. Perry Mason's? Yes. You see, I .. I feel so sleepy. Mrs Belter. Wake up, Mrs Belter. Jones. Go get Perry Mason. - You bet. Come on, Shorty. What do you suppose happened to her? Nurse, what is wrong with her? I don't know. She was alright when I gave her the hot milk. You know, I don't think Perry Mason went to Pinehurst at all. I know, my darling. My wonderful darling. Well, I am here now and I am not going to leave you again. [ Door knocks ] Open this door! Say, who do you think you are? Arthur B Jones of the homicide squad. Goodbye, Della. So the brilliant attorney retired from the practice of criminal law. Open that door or we break it down. Well. Wait until I put my pants on, will you. You've had time enough to knit a pair. Darling. I will be at the Ripley Hotel. Registered under the name of Fred P. Crosby of Detroit. I like Detroit. Don't you, Fred? - Yes, Mrs Crosby. Come on, fellahs. Stay by the door, Joe. Mike, take a look around. The rest of you men come in here with me. Where is Perry Mason? Oh. Good morning, officer. I am Mrs Mason. Won't you all sit down? - Where is Perry? Answer my question. Where is Perry Mason? Oh. I wish you hadn't asked me about my husband, officer. When we were first married. He was so thoughtful and so kind. So attentive and so devoted. But. But now. Now he leaves me for long periods at a time. He is tired of me, officer. Where is Spudsy? Tell him I want two dozen handkerchiefs. What a cold you have, Mr Crosby. No. I don't know where you will find Mr Mason. Frank Locke is anxious to see him too. Frank Locke? Well, that is news. Get in touch with Frank Locke. Tell him to meet me in 15 minutes at .. At the Shakespeare shop. Got it? Okay. I love you. Oh. So there you are, shyster. I would advise you to lower your voice. Well, have you decided to kill that Belter/Milnor story? Yes, chiseller. I've built up a whole new front page. That's only a sub-feature now. I am devoting my lead story to you. Mrs Belter talked, see. This story you mentioned. Will it be an interview on what I think of the new deal? Spicy Bits is going to accuse you of the murder of George C. Belter. What's more, we'll make it stick. Fortunately, this state has libel laws, my friend. You found out that Belter owned this paper. Sue him. He won't mind. And then you had better hire yourself a smart lawyer. You are going to need one. Have you a phone I could use? - Why, certainly. Use mine. Sit right down here. - Thank you. Hello. Long distance? I want to talk to Atlanta Georgia. [ Door knocks ] Is that Spudsy? - Yep. I got 'em, boss. You got what? - Your handkerchiefs. But what about Frank Locke? - Frank Locke? That fellow was almost hung for murder down in the Georgia. Here's his photograph. Where is the confirmation? Where is the wire? Esther Linton. Esther Linton? Spudsy. Put a tail on that blonde of Frank Locke's. Give her a smooth shadow. Do you understand? Follow her wherever she goes. I want to know where she lives. Everything about her. Can I help you, Miss? Well, have you these in a size 6? - Yes. Something for you, madam? - No thanks, buddy. No, no. No thank you. Just looking around. Are you interested in weights, madam? Hello. Mr Locke please. Miss Linton calling. Hello Frank. Listen. I've got to have a check right away. No. Today I mean. That's right. Alright. Goodbye. [ Door knocks ] Who is it? Spudsy? - Yeah. I got her, boss. Esther Linton. 350 Wheelwright apartments. The bellboy says she gets regular sugar from Spicy Bits. And with that accent, is she from Georgia. Has Frank Locke been out with her recently? From about eight o'clock last night until eleven thirty. Eleven-thirty? Then he didn't kill Belter. Hey, boss. You never thought that Frank Locke shot Belter, did you? Well, of course not you chump. But if I could make it look that way .. I could control Spicy Bits and that's what I want right now. That's what I've always said, boss. Now we are getting someplace. [ Buzzer ] Who is it? Telegram. Hello. What's the idea? I am sorry but you are in a jam. What are you, a detective? No. A lawyer. I want to talk to you about Frank Locke. Frank Locke? I have never heard of him. Now don't tell me you have forgotten good old Cecil Dawson. Surely you remember the Georgia business? The time you saved his neck by changing your testimony? Alright. What do you want? That's better. Come on, sit down. You were with him until 11:30 last night. That's right. - Alright. Unless you want to be sent back to Georgia for compounding a felony .. I am telling you what you did last night. You were tired and you had been drinking. I know where you'd like to send me but if you want to be on the same train .. You'd better come with me. I'll give you fifteen minutes and this time you'd better talk turkey. I can talk turkey. Well, it's your party. I may as well go back to my office. You do and you will regret it. We are going in here. Hey, what sort of a racket is this? Who's getting suspicious now? Come on. Hello, Kickopopolos. - Hello, Mr Mason. That is the man. Just a minute, Kicky. We've got to be sure about this. You put me on the witness stand. You bring one thousand lawyers. I tell you the same thing. That is the man. What's the idea? What sort of flimflam is this? It's just a part of my case. It checks up. That's all. What checks up? - You are the man who bought the gun. Are you crazy? I never bought a gun in my life. Give me your gun register, Kicky. Now beat it. I want to talk. I suppose you deny that you .. Wrote that? Certainly I'll deny it. I never was in this joint before and that's not my signature. The police don't know it yet but that gun killed George Belter last night. I am through with you. I'm not going to say another word. I am going back to my office and I .. Just a minute, Locke. I've got your motive. You've been embezzling funds. George Belter knew too much about that Georgia affair. Georgia affair? - I know what I'm talking about. You went out there last night about 9 o'clock and killed him. I .. I can prove where I was at 9 o'clock last night. I've got an ironclad alibi. And to show you where you stand I'm going to spring it now. Come on. Come in, Mason. Sit down. I'll call her. Esther. Yes, honey? Come on in. I want to talk to you. How do you do, Miss Linton. Won't you sit here? Say, what is this? - I can't explain now. Just tell this fellow where I was about 9 o'clock last night. Why, of course, Frank. We went out to dinner and after that we came here. What time was that? About 8:30 I guess. Go on, what happened then? What time did I leave? Didn't I sit in this room reading? And didn't I wake you to kiss you goodnight about 11:30? To tell you the truth, Frank. I woke up this morning with an awful headache and .. I knew you were here when I went to sleep. I don't know what time you went. That's not the truth and you know it. I am in a hurry Locke and I'm sure you're anxious to be heading south. Hello. Police headquarters? No police. This is Canton laundry. Put up that phone, Mason. You are number one boy now and you know it. Excuse me. Hello. Spicy Bits? Let me talk to Crandal. Hello Crandal? Locke. Kill that Beechwood Inn story in the Mason feature. Yes. Kill it. Okay. You are the doctor. And don't dig it up again or back you go to Georgia. Oh. Thank you, Peaches. That's the place over there. Wait here until I wave a handkerchief. I don't want him to know I brought you. - Okay. Welcome, Mrs Belter. Won't you come in? Why .. I thought this was Mr Mason's suite. Mr Perry Mason. Who are you? - I am the coroner. We are expecting a death momentarily. Won't you take a chair? I will see if he'll see you. She is here, Perry. But listen. Take the advice of an old friend. You are sick. This case has got you licked. You'd better get out of town. This is certainly a swell honeymoon. Murder. Influenza. Disbarment looms. Well. Goodbye, pal. You've been fine and I appreciate it. That is alright, Perry. What is a friend for? See you at the morgue. Why, Perry. You are ill. You poor boy. You poor boy. - Look, Della. I squeezed 22 pounds on my new strength tester. I never felt so rotten about anything in my life. But they throw questions at me and I .. - What questions? What have you done? Where have you been? Down at the police station. I told them that I heard your voice. So that's the way it is, eh? I am tossed overboard in mid-ocean. Perry, forgive me. It's curtains for you, baby, unless you stop double-crossing me for 5 minutes. I don't know what you are talking about. Honest I don't. You know what I mean. Identifying my voice to distract attention from yourself was a good idea. But it wasn't good enough. - But my dear .. Don't 'my dear' me. These envelopes will send you to the gallows unless you talk and talk fast. What do you want me to say? - The truth. That you killed your husband. - But I didn't. That is not true. Yes it is, and I can prove it. You might as well confess if you want to save your neck. In this envelope is Mrs Veite's sworn statement. That she saw you running out of the room two seconds after the shot was fired. And in this one. Is the statement of her daughter Norma. She was in the hall when you fired the shot. She saw you shoot him. Now, if you want me to save your life you had better spill it all. But I didn't kill him. I swear I didn't. I didn't! Spudsy. Bring me that lie detector. Huh? - That lie detector. You have got it in your hands my learned colleague. Bring it here and put it on the table. Now we'll see whether or not you are lying. Take hold of those handles and squeeze. Squeeze. Squeeze. Look, Boss. She squeezed thirty-five. Aha. I thought so. Alright. I did it. I did it. Take it away. I killed him. You'll sign a statement to that effect? Anything you say, Perry. Anything you say. Don't mind me. I just work here. Sign right here, Mrs Belter. No extra charge for hugs or kisses. There is the handkerchief. Get away from that window. What's the matter now? - No. I won't sign. I won't sign. You will sign that confession or I will start again. How do I know you won't use it against me? Because I am your attorney, Mrs Belter. And I have a code of honor. To say nothing of a cold in the head. Della, darling. I'm so sorry about our honeymoon. I think it is lovely up here at Pinehurst. Such air. And I have never been given so much of it. Is that fun? Perry Mason. You're under arrest. There is a break for you, Sergeant. You are going to make a real arrest. Here is Mrs Belter's confession. To the murder of her husband, signed sealed and delivered. It's a lucky break for you, big boy. In as much as I've a murder warrant in my pocket all made out in your name. Come on, Mrs Belter. Why, you double-crossing backstabber, you. Feeling better, Mrs Belter? - Come along. Tell the district attorney I'll be down to straighten up matters in the morning. What are you doing? Do you mind if I read the incriminating evidence, Perry? Not at all. Photographs of the bride and groom at Pinehurst. My, but that is good of you, Perry. Spudsy. Spudsy, you've got work to do. This case has hardly begun. Get out and get going on Norma Veite and her mother. I want to know everything about them from year one to the present day. Okay, chief. Eva Belter didn't kill her husband even though she thinks she's guilty. What about her signed confession? Just throwing a bone to the DA. Well .. I have got to get to work. And I have got to get a lawyer. Goodbye, Mr Mason. Della, darling. I am through. Understand? I never should have married you in the first place. All I've gotten is a .. A cold in the head. Darling, will you please tell me what I have done now? Nothing. Della, if you go out of that door you will never see me again. Oh .. The pain is here again. Goodbye, my darling. Remember that I loved you. But also remember I don't intend to die a lingering death from pneumonia. Look, boss. They are getting married. Who is getting married? Carl Griffin and Norma Veite. Too late to interest me, old boy. Goodbye. You have been faithful. Spudsy, has he gone? Yeah. Daffy. In the other room. Perry. Perry. Oh, Perry. Perry Mason. You come back in this room this minute. And all our yesterdays .. Have lighted fools a way to dusty death. Out. Out, brief candle. Perry. Perry, you fool. Sweetheart. [ Door knocks ] Say boss, the cops are here. Sergeant Hoffman and Jones. Hundreds of them. Tell them to go away. I did but they won't. Alright. I will see them. I'll give them all galloping influenza. Haven't I solved the murder case for you idiots? Why don't you go away and leave me alone? This is my home, my castle. The district attorney wants to see you, Perry. He thinks that Belter confession has a slight odor of fish. Sergeant, may I get a picture? - Alright. Mr Mason, will you .. - Yes, of course. Thanks. He also feels you know why Spicy Bits suddenly became very pro-Mason. Never heard of Spicy Bits. - Cut the clowning, Perry. What about the fight you had with Belter? At what are you driving, my lowbrow friend? Do I understand that on the word of that incredible woman .. I am being accused of murder? You got it right the very first guess. The idea fascinates me, Sergeant. Never in my entire career have I been suspected of murder. But. Do you think the district attorney will receive me in my robe de nuit? Don't you think something a little more formal? Alright. Change your clothes. But hurry it up. Give me a hand, will you Spudsy. Now, boys. If you'll all sit down I'll tell you a little story. Well, it was this way. Once upon a time .. There was an attorney who was under the delusion that he loved is secretary. Now, the secretary knew .. - I think we can do without that. That is just the point. The attorney said he couldn't do without the secretary. Aha. Sure is a lot of flu around here. Say, you don't suppose he is .. Just a minute. Come on, boys. Twenty-two, twenty-three. Hello, Sergeant. This is sure great for the legs. Where is Mason? - I don't know. Twenty-eight, twenty-nine. Thirty-one, thirty-two. Come on, boys. Would you like to hear the rest of the story, Sergeant? Herman Strongbrawn got his leopardskin after only sixteen lessons. There, there, Della. Don't you cry. He will be back. I'm not crying, Spudsy. I don't want him back. I hate him. That sounds like crying to me. No. No. I am laughing. At the thought of you .. In a leopardskin. But Perry, the paper says already that Mrs Belter is guilty. And now you say she is not guilty. Great soup, Kicky. [ Door knocks ] It's me Kickopopolos. Spudsy, remember? Hey boss. A break. A regular crime conference. A room down in Chinatown. A whole den of conspirators. Boy, am I good at solving crime cases. We need to get in for an earful. Why do you think I've developed my strength? I jemmied the door lock. If it is a suit you want, I have the very thing. A genuine first-class number. And just your size too. And what is more. The hat that goes it too. Break it out, Kicky. Mice. What is one murder, more or less? Yeah. If you persist in your demands there is apt to be another. You must be mad to consider such a thing at a time like this. As Mr Griffin's attorney I demand that you give us a temporary delay. I don't care what any of you say. I won't do it and that is final. Well, I'm running this show, Mr Griffin. Eva Belter killer her husband. Why not let it go at that? Ah. Rice cakes, Spudsy. Have one. What are you doing here, Mason? Come, Edward. You shouldn't use harsh tones to a fellow attorney. Mrs Veite. It looks like you are going to take a trip up the river. I trust you are prepared for a long absence. Are you crazy, young man? 'Stupid' is the adjective, Mrs Veite. Stupid. For not solving this case in five minutes. Norma, you are certainly a miserable little .. Well, that is two falls for you, Digley. Now, keep him covered, Ms Veite. Come on, the rest of you. And let's talk this over. I don't see that there is anything to talk over. This case is apple pie. You think so, do you Mr Mason? Certainly. I know the murderer. And the motive. And as soon as I get to a telephone .. What makes you think you will ever get to a telephone? So that's the way it is. That is just the way it is. Gee, boss. Is she going to knock us off? It would be a very silly move on her part. Possibly from your point of view. For mine, you are much too nosy. Come on, get it over. Suspense bores me. There goes my leopardskin. I beg your pardon. Grab him, boys. Spudsy, get the district attorney on the phone at once. Good evening, Sergeant. I was just solving a little murder case. Oh yeah, wise-guy? I knew if this gang started gathering it would attract the eminent Mr Mason. Perry, you're under arrest for murder. And try to get away this time. This arrest is because of Mrs Belter's testimony? Yes. And the fact three other people saw you at the Belter home last night. And the fact that you were thrown out once and then broke your way back in. The DA is on the phone, Mr Mason. I am going to have him defend me. Hello Burns. Say, listen. If you want to solve the Belter case get Mrs Belter to her house in 15 minutes. I will bring Sergeant Hoffman with me. No. I won't let him get away. Put on your hat so you won't catch cold. Sergeant, my apartment is on the way. We'll stop while I change into more appropriate garments. Alright. Let's go. And Spudsy. Go to Mrs Mason. Tell her to pack her bag. We are leaving for Pinehurst in an hour. Pinehurst? Thank you. Mrs Belter, let me remind you. That even though I surrendered you to the police, I am still your attorney. And I intend to see you free from a charge of murder within fifteen minutes. Your confession is true. In that .. when I left this room just before 9 o'clock last night. You had an argument with your husband. He threatened you and the reputation of another party. Another party? Now reposing .. in a sanatorium. Suffering the tortures of a nervous breakdown. By the way, Riley. Would you mind telephoning the Fairview Sanatorium. Tell Dr Lane that he may release .. Algernon P. Fortescue. He is well now. Algernon P. Fortescue? Okay. You admit. That you drew a pistol and pointed it at your husband. Don't you, Mrs Belter? You shot him. Threw the gun on the floor and ran out of the house. Then you ran to a drugstore and telephoned me. We read the phony confession, Mason. Do you know that two shots were fired at George Belter? That one of them went out the open window right behind your head? That window there. Mr Mason. Mr Mason, what do you think happened? What is it, Spudsy? I think I caught a cold. - Go on. Beat it. No, no. Look. Look, Mr Mason. Ain't that wonderful? Take him away. Lock him up. - But that ain't all, Mr Mason. It's Della. She .. - What of Della? She's gone to night court. She says she will get a judge to annul the marriage. Mr Burns, you must wait .. - Now listen, Mason. You can't get away with any more tricks. - Look here. You've known me for years. My wife has gone. This is my honeymoon. You've got to wind this up now or never. I am through fooling around. Alright, come on. Let's compromise and settle it in the car. Alright. Well, Mrs Veite. You just couldn't wait. Until the publicity died down before forcing Carl to marry Norma. You are out of your head. No. It is .. It's just a cold. You see. I saw Carl Griffin at the Belter house last night. He was going out but here is the catch. He didn't go out. He was in the driveway when he heard a shot. [ Gunshot! ] Uncle George. What happened? - She thought she killed me. She stood right there and pulled the trigger. But the bullet went out the window. Eva tried to kill you? Yes. And I let her think she hit me. But why should she want to kill you? Principally because I changed my will in your favor. She couldn't stand the thought of seeing you get all that money. She thinks she killed you? - Yes. Isn't it a scream? Where were you standing, uncle George? I was standing right here. What's up with you? Thanks for changing your will. I can use your money for good advantage. Well, Mr Griffin. It looks like a slight case of murder. Alright. How much will it cost me? Why, you .. Don't try to move. I've got you in a vice-like grip. You see, Hoffman. If Mrs Veite hadn't tried to blackmail Carl quite so soon .. They may have got away with it. What about the proof? There is still .. - The matter of an empty cartridge. Here it is. I took the liberty of taking it last night. Your ballistic expert will identify it. And now you may free Mrs Belter. Even though she has wrecked my marriage. Thank you, Perry. Much obliged, Perry. But Judge, I tell you the man had me under a spell. He took unfair advantage. Young lady, you are still Mrs Mason. And there's not a thing I can do about it. If the court please .. And what kind of a performance do you call this, Perry Mason? Your Honor. A plea for annulment is not within the province of a night court. Your Honor. I demand protection from this man. He is a professional home leaver. - Your Honor, I .. Gee, Mary F. Remember saying you owed me a nickel for a paper I delivered 20 years ago? Well, I'll forget all about it if you will be a pal. Wait a minute. Court is adjourned. For a ten-minute recess. Come with me. Say. Are you with Mr Mason's party? Am I with Mr Mason's party? Have you ever seen my picture in the paper? I'm the guy what solves all his cases. Then see if you can solve what that dame is talking about. Dame? On the phone. Hello. Who? Miss Simpson. He says there is a million dollars in it for Mr Mason if .. He will defend him. Not a chance. You tell him Mr Mason has been set up for life or is out of town. Pinehurst. Darling, you will love it up there. And please believe me. I will never take another criminal case. Promise? I said 'Pinehurst Lodge'. ..r-o..
