Can he hide here? Like hiring him or something Your stupidity is really inherited from your dad Would the customer want to ask the trashman to clean up for him What is your relationship We are friends I can't make him work here Mr. Dan You go to work, I'll take care of the rest Go ahead Come with me They also have families It would be bad if they got targeted They're all rude and their work clothes will break immediately It's a pity, I can still wear it if I sew it Learn how to use a sewing machine No one else will be seen here You live and work here I'll pay you first, spend it before it rots The owner here passed away a year ago You are free to use That... First time I saw that guy bring friends Thank you, trashman Ah, one more thing Cover your body with a cloth or the like I... I am afraid of monsters Really scared If you give it to Mr. Dan, there will be no problem We caught heretics in the Udagawa area is a descendant of that astrologer She will be executed How long will this go on Heretics must be strictly banned Your ancestors... 250 years guarding the land Our responsibility is to pass it on to the next generation "The outside world" does not exist This is the world Anyone who conspires will be executed Wanted Garbage Man What is this Those are the pants I lost this is my shirt-my coat My Who made this up Pope what's that This is a cape I sewed it myself Those are also Mr. Dan offered me a job Working in a tailor shop in an underground street The Tailor That's...

This is me too... ha chirp Lubich-Yes How was that trash man yesterday Mr. Dan gives him work... That's it The heretic inquisitor seems to be looking for him everywhere Better not get involved with him - Rubich... - Thank you for caring about me so much Is it here Lubiqi it's nothing please don't mind-rubic Lubich Is it here? No way... No way No way... Why Lubich, you shouldn't be afraid of heights You see you've been shaking I'm not shaking Don't look down I know it, be careful not to let things fall Have you ever let things fall? One exercise Hand exercises That's the exercise my dad gave me I lost it here Why so important Where to bring work? Sweeping the chimney doesn't require any manual exercises It's too late to say this Great... Although I am afraid of heights But when you climb up, you will feel very happy and excited Yeah I feel it now too But we can't climb higher than the chimney Do you know "The Star"? Stars On top of that smoke There are shining stars Really I'm not sure But I'm not sure the stars don't exist either This is a fairy tale my dad made up Chimney Town is full of chimneys Smoke everywhere, always overhead Smoky because of black smoke Smoky from morning to night Everyone in Chimney Town is trapped in black smoke Never seen a blue sky I have never seen a shining star This story is awesome Everyone said the same at the beginning In towns that forget their heads A man raised his head That guy is still doing this What a nonsense star... Hey Bruno, keep talking Beware of being targeted by heretic interrogators Oh, here you are Sister-in-law, please say something to him too If he wants to tell a story, let him tell it This couple is really alike That's why we got married In towns that forget their heads A man raised his head Looking at the black smoke that enveloped the town, the man began to think... Nothing on it Recognize the reality, or you will be useless when you grow up Hello It doesn't matter what you say about me But that kid's future... You are not qualified to decide Assholes beat people you liar-don't be too arrogant What's wrong As usual My little one's choice has nothing to do with you git He's an idiot What a joke Damn I lost No chance of winning from the start It hurts... I made you laugh Open your hand and let me see the little one Those guys are going too far Dad, you stepped on it It's really big This is today's apology, sorry for embarrassing you Doctor says symptoms are not getting better Don't worry, mom is strong The doctor says there is no cure Maybe there is medicine in the outside world look up If a star emerges from the smoke gap It will only be a moment If you miss that moment, you won't see it If you want to see the stars, you can't miss that moment You must spend more time looking up than others Keep believing If you look down Maybe I will miss my chance to cure my mother It doesn't matter if no one is paying attention As long as you believe that there is light outside that black smoke Do it and feel it Don't succumb to common sense, believe it to the end Even if it's just you Even if it's just you Be confident too and keep looking up At that time, there will be partners looking up together aka "friend" What's beyond the smoke Don't tell everyone this story, you will be laughed at Why I think it's great No, keep it confidential I have a hunch it's about to start The footsteps that can ride the wind and waves I found you you are my friend Heartbeat gradually increases Feel like breaking everything I am not afraid of anything now Even if the world laughs at me I still believe Just the words Just this time From us to dreams The vowed night begins Everything will be a miracle It's so big Hey it's that guy Wait for me Hey trashman what are you doing Working... Work This looks like something Rubic would say Do you know Lubiqi? How about you? Are you someone Lubiqi knows? I'm not someone I know I'm his friend Hey... he still has time to play with trash people I thought he was working all day after his dad died dead Hey he didn't tell you, it seems he doesn't know My grandpa saw it Bruno runs to the forbidden cliff Seeing another big wave and disappearing into the sea... Monster figure Monster Bruno has disappeared since that night He must have fallen into the sea drunk and was eaten by monsters I heard that he drinks until late every day He asked for it What time is this A year ago The owner here passed away a year ago It's so hard to just go to work without my dad Why didn't he inherit the tailor shop It should be for money Chimney sweepers are well paid He wanted to see the stars Lubich is to see the stars Like his dad That's why he chose a place with a good view He is obviously afraid of heights Still climb the chimney every day That's funny You mean the stars in Bruno's story are real or fake Yes no wrong I also want to watch the stars with Lubiqi How could there be stars Don't take fiction too seriously Wait Antonio Are you spreading rumors to get us into trouble No stars at all don't fight -you're too much, enough is enough As long as you are in this world it will be polluted Go get eaten by monsters too Pope of Chimney Town He was here just now Then escaped Trash people talk about stars Also said to watch the stars with Lubiqi...

Stop doing anything against the rules I don't want to lose my family anymore... Lord Leita is the only one left Help me get rid of him secretly Yes What a pity He's not a bad guy That's right It's not right to want to know the outside world had to ask him to disappear Mr. Dan...

Mr. Dan fell down the chimney I shouldn't be with trash people Being with you makes everyone unhappy Why are you appearing in front of me Not... Lubich... If there is something precious don't want to be taken away No one likes being a kid all the time Dream still floats in the air Me and you for two Let's take the painted road together How it would look to you The first person to believe must be yourself My heart is darker than night But I keep looking for stars in my heart Because I believe that's you Just give me a hug I have something to say to you Why does it always fail...

Pope I am trash Sorry I really don't know anything Sorry Sorry What's wrong I don't know-how are you I don't know But my heart is calling hard... call what rubbish and huge... Pope what are you calling for I don't know Monster... The monster in the sea... That's not a monster Hey Don't you remember Why Why that one is here Lubich Get out of the way What's going on Appears to be washed back by the waves The ship is sinking, how can it be washed by the waves I don't know I think it's better to tell the truth to the people Please rest assured, Mr. Leita Public not aware of the existence of the boat So let it stay here makes them more afraid of the ocean The outside world doesn't exist That's it The original father's serial drama Not just a fairy tale That ship is in Dad's comic strip Hey That serial drama is Dad's story Maybe Dad did see it Pope Yes Help me I want to let everyone know What Dad wants to convey Want to see the stars? We are not going to see For everyone in town to see What's the matter, a straight face early in the morning Are you going to blackmail me with my secrets again? Forgive me I led the way that day Transaction should be done There should be two more You said you would fulfill our wishes There are two wishes left Please share with us the smokeless explosives No I can't accept this I did say that my wishes will come true But this is my eating guy Cannot be used indiscriminately Okay I see. This is a great opportunity I will tell you what I believe Why do I use such dangerous explosives Dig holes even at the risk of getting caught There's only one reason because it's full of adventure There is no freedom on the ground Those heresy inquisitors abuse their power As soon as you act rashly, you will be caught like this Too dull and no one can speak And this is full of adventure A lot of history is buried in the soil I can keep discovering new things and teach me many things Although I am a mine thief, I am not for money I'm looking for excitement Seeking excitement with this stuff I can't borrow it from you for boring things I'm going to blow up the smoke in the air Blast the smoke that enveloped the town with smokeless explosives So everyone can see the world above the smoke Looks like you've discovered the world's secrets What my dad told me in a comic strip So you're Bruno's son, no wonder... This is blood that can't stop it I don't know how much of this story is true In short, there is a story among the miners is about the origin of this town Tell me please 250 years ago There's a chaotic town on the other side of the sea Stealing or killing is common practice "Money" rules people's lives Dominates people's hearts and eventually leads people to compete with each other Sivio. Reta came forward to stop this situation He's the town economist Reta believes that all things decay with time so the value will be lower But only money doesn't spoil over time This makes the rich more powerful than the rich This also leads to people fighting for money So Reta invented the money "I" that will perish over time The longer the time passes, the lower the value of "I" This works very well Money just rots anyway So people actively use "I" The town flourished But good times don't last The spread of perishable money is bad for certain groups of people It's the central bank After the town was free of money Free at last Why take it all Don't ask us this is the central directive What a fool Don't ask superfluous questions You have family too, don't you Come with us Dad The miracle currency "I" to save the town is abolished Reta sentenced for civil disturbance The town is in chaos again At this time, Reta's son stood up under his leadership Family and comrades vow to revive "I" They don't want "I" to be overwhelmed again Decided to find land away from the clutches of central banks Is that here? Yes They decided to build a town here Prohibit people from going to sea Totally cut off external communication The so-called sea monster... It was just a lie to keep the townspeople out They are very afraid of people knowing the outside world If people know about it, they will want to go to the outside world Once the communication occurs, it will be discovered by the central bank There is only one job passed down from generation to generation in the Reta family Just to make the townspeople forget the outside world How to do it with smoke They build chimneys everywhere to fill the sky with smoke Make the outside world disappear My grandfather told me repeatedly Don't say this to anyone But once I got drunk in a pub Accidentally slipped out Who to tell Your Dad Lubich must explode in the center to be useful Can you do it It can be done Dynamite... Is that enough? Lubich What's outside the smoke with stars This is exciting I've always had dreams that I wanted to believe in But I didn't have the courage to keep believing It's not because of weakness You can't fool yourself Not here Somewhere instead Can this be changed in the future Go to confirm Go to the sky On the other side of the impenetrable wall Fate is certain Waiting for our awakening Is it right not to make mistakes No such thing Shyness will only get in the way, throw it away Go ahead was discovered and we're not ready... The people from the heretic interrogation center seem to have assembled at the beach-something Looks like I found a spammer Grab them be faster Don't worry Ah, listen to me Have you ever heard of the "lazy ant effect" I'm sure you've heard it but don't know the details The general impression of ants is that they are very hardworking wrong In fact, 20% of ants will be lazy The so-called rice bug He's buying us time This is the third wish It is very interesting to observe a hundred ants together 20% will work hard and 60% will work normally The remaining 20% will be lazy Trashman - This story is more interesting later... - Rubich If you work hard The 20% of the ants are put together Puppy - that's 20 As a result, 20% of the 20 will work hard 60% will work normally, the remaining 20% will be lazy Where and when team members arrange Work hard, work normally, lazy ants This "2 to 6 to 2" ratio is unchanged And ants are not extinct in this situation, right? So lazy 20% Maybe essential for species conservation Do you want to be lazy too Do you know the most effective way to stop hiccups Important appointments, important meetings It must be annoying to keep hiccupping This method should be used at this time Hey, go away Sorry are you not interested in this topic? Then I will disclose my unique skills How to patch up the marks of pushpins on the wall Go away they're going to sea What are you talking about they're not going to sea They are for everyone to see the stars fly up Strange Stars He said he slipped his tongue Let's hurry You Say... stars that... what to say My mission is over I'm Scorpio bye Stars What are stars Lubich... The stars are not... The one in Bruno's comic strip? He really wants to see How could there be wake up Stop talking all day They seem to want to see the stars Just kidding, how could 0there be such a thing Have you seen it... Have you seen it... don't make trouble-yes Have any of you seen it Has anyone seen the smoke outside Not at all So everything isn't sure isn't it? Not sure if there are stars or not If you don't explore the uncertain If you keep ignoring... Then nothing starts Sorry Don't apologize Don't apologize, Rubich You did nothing wrong You look like your dad Mom... What are you two doing, really... What is "how to know if you don't go and see" Don't be silly Your dad laughs when he's happy I cry when I'm sad Hungry and tantrums When I get angry, I will beat people He's a hopeless idiot How could a fool like that lie Your dad said something about stars... Then there must be stars You are your father's son It can't stop you now I know this best If you want to go, go ahead But mom will order you Be sure to... come back Good What are you doing, arrest the heretics Go away don't touch me Do you think you'll be fine Take this man too What are you going to do All heretics will be arrested... Heritage Not right This is what people feel is wrong Still unable to act... The Voice of All What a thrill Grab them They're coming for you, go away What the hell are you doing If you find a star... If you find a star... I would feel stupid for giving up that day, damned Don't worry, the stars really exist I saw it with my own eyes Go ahead and confirm, don't procrastinate Idiot, no time to cry over there It will be faster if we help together Successful Antonio Lubich Let's go Poppy Go to what my dad saw Good Go ahead Hold tight Dad what story will you tell this time Oh this world forbids us to go to sea It's about the man who built a boat to go to sea Pope's Adventures Pope went out to sea in a boat and finally he found it The world that stretches out infinitely And the other side of the town's smoke What's up with stars Chimney Town is full of chimneys Smoke everywhere, always overhead Smoky because of black smoke Smoky from morning to night People living in Chimney Town All trapped in black smoke Never seen a blue sky I have never seen a shining star In towns that forget their heads A man looked up Looking at the black smoke that enveloped the town, the man thought... He met the talking mole in the tavern Hear stories about dreams Stories about the world outside the smoke Stories about the Shining World You will feel incredible But you can't deny its existence Because no one has been there Wake up - no one knows the answer From now on men have been around the clock The story of the world beyond the smoke shouting over and over again He was ridiculed for being an idiot He is considered a liar and no one cares about him But what did the man do wrong Does the man hurt anyone? There is no reason for this In towns that forget their heads It's full of an "unobtrusive" vibe In towns that forget their heads Talking about dreams will get ridiculed Action will be criticized Smoke engulfs town, no light allowed Smoke swallows people not applauding any courage The man shouted despite this He took the boat to sea despite the trembling of his legs To the dark and terrifying sea To the uninhabited ocean To the uninhabited ocean Stories about the world outside the smoke Stories about the Shining World You will feel incredible But you can't deny its existence Because no one has been there Nobody knows the answer How can you find out if you don't see it with your own eyes How can I be swallowed by smoke Ride one wave Ride two waves He was struck by the storm and he was upset But no port to go back to There is no partner to rely on either On the back of my mind, I found that the bottom of the boat was full of holes Sink if you stop swiping His boat was so tattered it could barely float Not much progress yet How to stop here How to stop here How to stop here Men take courage Untie the ropes holding the luggage Come on Throw the impossible into the sea Throw excuses and excuses into the sea Just some food left And firm awareness Challenge the waves again Just a little bit more You will tremble when you look down, look up Idiot, look down and tremble look up Come on Come on... Ladies and gentlemen, please come over... Let's meet together Tonight is night town...
