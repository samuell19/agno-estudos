Yeah. You're a good bird. Gonna take you home, get your leg better. Dear William, Thank you so much for the birthday present. I'm so happy you remembered, as few here at the orphanage did. It's interesting how life works out, isn't it? Years ago, when you first joined my orphanage's outreach program, I never imagined we would become such good friends. You have enriched my life and for doing this, I'm eternally grateful. Hope all is going well on the wildlife refuge. Please write again soon. How are you feeling? I do so look forward to your letters. Always, your friend, Irena Morawska. Dear Irena, I'm glad you liked the American-Indian bracelet. A true symbol of our friendship. At the same time, it pains me to know that others at the orphanage failed to recognize your special day. You're an intelligent, special girl, so trust me when I tell you this: Pave your own path and do not wait for others to lead you. You'll benefit more in the end. By the way, you've done well with the tracker puzzles I've sent you. Over the next couple of letters, I'll send ones that are a little bit more challenging. This one's called a cipher. Like I said, it's a bit more advanced but I'm sure you'll catch on quick. William. Friends forever. Here's another cipher for you to try and solve. Remember Napoleon, the great general, once wrote, "He who fears being conquered is sure of defeat." I suppose I'm just trying to say that we can rise above our problems. The answers are all there if we look close enough. Be strong. Watch where you go. In six months, I will be 14, and have to leave the orphanage. I'm not sure where to go after that. Still, as you have taught me, I can see opportunity in all things. Mrs. Donata told me she has big plans for me and not to worry. Whatever happens, I know that you and I will remain connected. Irena. Anything else? Thank you, Rosie. Do you know any good jokes? Guess that means no. Cup of coffee? Just give me some more of whatever he's having. Look what the cat drug in. I bet you thought you'd never see me here. I was hoping I wouldn't, you know, but shit happens. Old Shepherd always talked about the high mighty shit you once did for the government. But that's in the past. We're living in the here and now. You saved my ass a few times, as I recall. I owe you one, Billy. Well, let's just call it even, Lewie. I'll count to 10. Let's see how far you can run before I catch you. One. Two. Three! The thrill of the chase, Mrs. Donata. It's always a constant source of amusement to me. Dear Irena, I may have to go away for a while, but don't worry. You can contact me in Montreal at the address below. It's hidden in the cipher called Zodiac. Remember Napoleon and be strong. Anna Brodsky, Marta Majewska, Irena Morawska, Agnieszka Dawinska. You've all dreamed of homes, families and a better life. Well, dreams can come true. It's my job to expedite such dreams. Polander. If you could be anything, what would you like to be? A model in a magazine. A model? Well you're not exactly model material... But still... And you? What would you like to be? A good student, sir. Lord have mercy, what a mess. I didn't want to play this. Doesn't have to be difficult, William. Just need to talk. Well, I tell you what. Play this by the books for me, and, uh, I'll come peacefully. Sure. By the book. It's nothing personal, it's just too many loose ends. Cabin's a nice touch. You know, I built this cabin with my own money. Mm-hm. Glad to see you saved. That was smart. Bring William to the van. Take him. Put the gun down, Shepherd. Set it down very gently. Now get over here. Very good. Now I want you to turn around. It doesn't matter how far a man runs. He can't run away from himself. You're still a company man, William, and we will find you. It's time to leave, Irena. My American friend, will you make sure that he receives this? Ah, that's funny. Okay, I gotta go, bye. Mr. Delacroix. Anything in the box for Lansing? Let's take a look. Ah, I'm afraid only one this time. Dear Mr. Lansing, we regret to inform you that Irena Morawska will no longer be able to correspond with you. Uh, let me have your bag. Be better for the photo. Alright. Oh, you can smile a bit. Hmm? Alright. What kind of foster program is this? It's a special program for very talented kids, good students like you. What do we have here? A letter from America, huh? Those are mine! Hey, hey. Burn these. What do we have here? Hmm? I haven't seen a cipher like this in a long time. I think we'll call her Lola. Lola? FAISAL: Lola. I like Lola. Whenever you're ready. And just remember to look right into the lens, okay? Hmm? My name is Agnieszka. When I grow up, I want to be a model. Go on, you're doing fine. Go on. A model... I... No! All professional models suffer from stage fright. Welcome to Poland, Mr. Davenport. Are you here for business or pleasure? A little sight-seeing. This doesn't look like a modeling agency. Come on, girls. Agnieszka, what are you thinking? Be careful. Agnieszka! No, don't leave! You can try to run, but there's nowhere to hide. And now I'm forced into making an example of you. You're fast. Not quite fast enough. Come in. Hey. Can I help you? Yeah, I'm William Lansing. I'm staying at the Royale Hotel. I believe I received a letter from you about Irena Morawska. I'm sorry, Mr. Lansing. I wasn't expecting you, I mean... Irena said you worked outside with animals. Did she say that? Would you go with me for a moment? Sure. This is where she would sleep. It was all such terrible business. Irena running away, I mean... Of course, I called the police. But... Irena ran away, huh? Perhaps there was a boy. She was at that age, and Irena was special. She was special, but I don't think there was a boy. Napoleon. Listen, mind if I call the police? Of course. But would your collegues expect you to return home shortly? Thank you, ma'am. Hello? Yes, we have a problem. A man asking questions. Says he's calling the police. I told you, any more trouble, I want out. Going somewhere? Sit down. I told him nothing. This, uh, Mr. Lansing, did he say anything out of the ordinary? Napoleon. Napoleon? A soldier, an emperor. But still to some, just a little corporal. Hmm? Pretty, isn't it? But like any rose, a company must cut its thorns. I have no pen to write with. No paper. And something is very wrong with the men who have taken me. I'll try to leave you a message. Don't give up on me. I'll never give up on you. Poni Pominiaski, please. Hello? I have an emergency missing person situation. Would you be able to see me immediately? My name is Williams. Forty minutes, I can do that. Thank you. Thank you. Who sent you? Look! Up there! Who sent you? Wrong answer! Yes, Mrs. Donata, head of the orphanage has been murdered. That's all the information we've got so far. How are you doing, young man? Try these on. Now that's what I'm talking about. See? Where I come from, we would say you look "cool." I like that. That's right. Listen, I'm gonna write down my phone number, and where I am. If you need me, call me. That's where I am. You hear? Can I help you, sir? I was, uh, looking for the director. I'm Detective Lato. Was she expecting you? Not really. Let's talk outside. Mrs. Donata was brutally murdered. Hours later, I find a mysterious stranger on her doorstep asking questions. Who are you? I'm Bill Hale, I'm with the Global Relief Fund. How well did you know Mrs. Donata? I didn't know her well at all. I just kind of met her in passing. You don't look like a typical outreach volunteer. How long have you been in Warsaw, Mr. Hale? You know what? I gotta send my boss an e-mail. I gotta go. Okay. You can send your e-mail from our office. And we have a few more minor questions for you. You're late, Faisal. - I'm here, Mr. Elgin. - What is the problem? A multi-million dollar business. An empire. Now more profitable than narcotics traffic. It's like a giant hand with fingers that stretch out across the globe. "Human trafficking" always seemed like such an uninspired phrase. Still it's extraordinary what you hear on the BBC World Service these days. You know, I heard about a woman who was murdered in an orphanage. I was only attending to matters personally. Well, your personal touch is turning into a cause for concern. I've always proven reliable in the past, haven't I? There can be no further exposure and I don't want to discuss this ever again. Just think of it like chess. If you don't protect your king, you're on the road to ruin. I apologize. There's a call for you. Please take a seat, Mr. Hale. I'll be right back. Irena Morawska. "Unite Alliance of Nations." We called the Global Relief Fund. Your story seems to check out. Just write down your contact information, and you're free to go, Mr. Hale. - You're losing your touch, Ibo. - Getting fat and sloppy. I'm not sure I like this new work, colonel. Pain is your friend, Ibo. Learn to love pain, and it'll set you free. I understand. Good. Azimi, over here and tell me something good. The American? I check governmental sources, non-governmental sources. He doesn't exist. Then why are all your friends dead? They were good men, colonel. And the codes and the letters? I want this entire operation moved swiftly, Azimi! You're a very clever girl. I can see why William is so fond of you. And even more why I can't let you go. It's time to devise a killer plan for your Mr. Lansing. Digital videotape. Let's get it to the lab. You said it was urgent? I found this. It's your handwriting. That it is. We found your letter on the girl. There's also this. I read your letter, Mr. Lansing. You knew how to pass as a volunteer for the Global Relief Fund. You knew about the message on the mirror walls. I'm an amateur. Just a little bit of guesswork. I don't believe you came all this way on guesswork. You obviously have a past. Sounds to me like you're the one doing the guesswork now. Look, every year, thousands of children go missing. We have a serious problem of human trafficking here. With the evidence I have, I could hold you on suspicion of murder. You're not leaving this town until I find out what's going on. Who are you? Like I said, just an amateur shooting in the dark. Thanks for the drink. "United Alliance of Nations." Irena taught you that, didn't she? Irena? See, I taught Irena that. It's a code. Come on in here. Men came for Irena, didn't they? What'd they look like? Gangsters. Military. And what did they look like? You pickpocketed them, didn't you? You know what this is? This is a Turkish flag. Yeah, we're getting somewhere. This is the Irena Morawska case, right? Yeah. Detective Lato said you're having trouble with the tape. This is a simple case of signal versus digital throughput. You think this is funny? You wanna get drunk? It's like a big ring. And what's this here? Embassies. Diplomats. Embassies and diplomats? Agnieszka. That's right. You saw who took the girls. Help me, and I'll make sure that this doesn't happen again. Why the long face, Weiss, huh? This is the best shit we've had in a long time. Don't tell me you're getting soft on me now, are you? That's it, follow me. Thank you. No, let her stay. Hi. Hi. Tell me, what move would you make, huh? You have the wrong pieces protecting your king. Check. Smart move. Very smart. Good afternoon, madam, I'm Mr. Demarest. I'm here with the International Education Fund, and I wanted to know who I should see about donations. Donations? I think you have to talk to Mr. Weiss in finance and operations, but he's still out to lunch. Mm-hm. Okay, well, I'll just wait over here. Thank you. Any messages for me? Just a man from the American Education Fund asking about donations. I told him to wait. Mr. Weiss, I've been waiting here for a half an hour. They say time is money and I've been known to make some very large donations. There's a little thing called respect, you know what I mean? You shouldn't bring that American in. I don't think he did it. Do you have anything new? The girl. She came from a UAN school, like all the other missing girls. My friend, Agnieszka. I heard her screaming. As long as you do as you're told, you're alright, Lola. My name's Irena. Sure it is. Eat your food. Missing People Department, please. - This is Weiss. - All tapes delivered. International online bidding will commence now. Max-Com internet. Washington bids 75,000. London bids 200,000. I trust my men won't have any problem at the embassy ball. It's not a problem. Mr. Lansing seems to have ignored our message. Yeah. If he thinks the girl is dead, then he is not a problem. Some homicide detective phoned Weiss' office, asking about school records. Weiss sent out the current shipment of tapes. Time to ship him out. Missing children. You've not heard anything, Pawel? You don't want this case, Kasia. And if your father was alive, he'd tell you the same thing. I thought I'd find you guys here. Kasia, be smart. Stay out of trouble. You know, uh, maybe you shouldn't be drinking with folks like that. Maybe I shouldn't be drinking with you. Besides, um, he's my uncle. Oh, did I offend you? So to what do I owe this visit? If there was an illegal Internet service in Warsaw, who would I talk to about it? Maybe you should ask my uncle. Look, you want real information, you tell me something good. Okay. The girl from the warehouse. Her name was Agnieszka Lewicka. I already know that. Okay. There's a man called Weiss. From the UAN. I know that too. He has information for me back at his house. Aside from all the joking, these people are very serious, they don't care who they kill. I can take care of myself. Can I ask you a question? How much have you had to drink? Why don't I be your designated driver? Give me the keys. I'll take you where you want to go. Okay. You're gonna be alright. Just lie down, relax. You have to drink, and you're gonna have to get rid of some of this pain. Little bit more, a little bit more. That'll take away the pain. Lie down, lie down. You're gonna be alright. Stay with me. I'm going to cauterize this to stop the bleeding. Come on. Wake up. Stay with me. Lato, relax. We're done. We're done. It's over. It's over. You did good. You did good. Did you get all the mail? Where's the letter from Max-Com? It's delivered today, should be on the shelf. Then somebody's been in here. Is it done? Weiss and his mistress, yes. And what about the female homicide detective? Was she there? Yes, but we have a slight problem. The American was there. Let's see if you can do something right. Hmm? Shoot me. Do it! You know what the problem with my father was? He wasn't hard enough on me. Don't worry, I closed my eyes during the procedure. Where did you learn all this? I've been around a couple places, you know. You were in the military, weren't you? Please don't move. The people who killed Weiss are gonna be coming for us, so we're going to have to be very careful. Who's behind all this? I think they're people with diplomatic connections, possibly Turkish. Whatever you do, don't call your colleagues. We'll only endanger their lives. I made a mistake once. I'm not going to make the same mistake again. Good morning, colonel. Your messaged seemed rather vague. Like I said, I'm a stranger going to the West. Where you from? What if I said I was from the East? What do you want, friend? I think we both know where this comes from, colonel. I don't understand. I hear you're looking for a man who writes letters. And why is this of any interest to you? Mm, let's just say I could help you put a face to the name. I'll, uh... I'll have somebody contact you. Your business isn't my concern. We need to put an old dog out of his misery. Find something interesting? Is this your home? One of many. Where's your real home? It's everywhere. Tell me about your new friend William. He's nice. Nice? Nice? Is that all? You're on to where the children might be, right? I'll tell you what. I think this company Tara has got an online Internet scam selling people all over the world. It fits. What do you think? Good to go. Would you like to go to a party? An embassy ball. What would you be doing at an embassy ball? Oh, business. Pleasure. Just like this game of chess. It's simply about the moves you make. Well? Check. Check. Mate. I want to go home now. You are home, dear. My friend... William. He'll come. You'll see. I look forward to meeting him. The sooner, the better. Is that him? Is that the man? Son, is that the man? Yes. What I need to do is get an invitation to this embassy ball. I'm hungry. The caviar looks nice. I'll bring you food after I put you downstairs. Keep walking. I think you're gonna drug my food and I won't eat it. Food won't be drugged. If you don't let me eat some of that caviar, I'll scream. No, you won't. Let her eat. This... ...is... ...a trap. You had enough. Make sure no one touches this. It's been a while, my friend. Yes, it has. How are you? Hmm. What can I do for you? I was thinking, I, uh, wanted to get into the Turkish Embassy Ball tonight. Thought maybe you could sorta arrange a special pass. I'm not certain that I can help you this time. Alright, well, I'm sorry for asking. I'll just, go to our old friends in Moscow and do it like that. Right. I want both of these stairwells covered in case he tries to exit. Hey, gentlemen, will you excuse me for a second? There's somebody who wants to see you, sir. He says that your friend who was travelling West sent him. "Travelling West." Yes. Ibo, take over for me. Where are you going so dressed up? Got a rental car down in the parking lot. Here's the keys. Cash in the glove box. If you leave now, you can hit the Czech border by nightfall. How about you? I'd like you to keep going. Don't stop for anyone. Don't even stop to eat. When you get to the Capitol Hotel, call me. You're leaving us, aren't you? Not exactly. I just think this could get a bit dangerous, and I don't want you'll around for that. You said we were friends. We are friends. Nothing to do with that. Come here. Give me a hug. Alright. Take care of her. You gonna give her a hug? Be safe, guys. Be careful. Why didn't they invite you to the party upstairs? Stop trying to get inside my head. I should be upstairs on point, not down here playing babysitter. Besides, I'm the only one who can identify this guy. That's why you're here. Now... if anyone comes through that door, you know what to do, right? How are you? How are you? Nice to see you. Very nice to see you. Either put that thing out or open the door. Ah, hello, Mr. Murdock. My friend from Russia, Nickolai Rodchenko. So nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you. - A businessman. Ha-ha! I would love to very much. My old friend, Nickolai Rodchenko. Friend from Russia. Oh! Faisal! Always a pleasure, Vasili. How are you? Who's this? I'm Nickolai Rodchenko. Nice to meet you. That's a firm grip there, Nickolai, and your name is indeed familiar. No, no, no. Bring the special caviar for our Russian guest. So, uh, maybe we'll speak again in a more intimate setting. Perhaps. Yeah. Some food? Compliments of Mr. Faisal. Ah, an elegant arrangement. My compliments to the chef. This is a trap. You should try some. She's here. Hey. Your friend, uh, Nickolai. Where is he? Hmm... Where'd he go, Vasili? Sorry. Now we've got him. Go. Excuse me. You're not going anywhere, William. Don't worry. Hang in there, kid. Is it warm? As usual. Good evening. May I help you? Well, I've been told that you have a rather spectacular establishment and seems to be the case. I was wondering if you could show me around. The structure itself dates back to the time of King Stanislav. Really? He was the lover of Catherine the Great. They used to meet here in secret. The walls have hidden passages for those who may need a discreet exit. We pride ourselves on discretion. It's a beautiful room. Listen, you know the young lady that I saw earlier with the hair combed straight back? Do you think I could spend some time with her? Smart choice. I'll send her in. Thank you so much. You speak English? Yes. Where are you from? I'm from Turkey. Wow. Listen. I know that you're used to one thing or another, but we're going to do something a little different. He's probably checked out of the hotel already. I wouldn't even know where to look for him. Okay. - Coffee, sir. - No, thank you. Who is is that lady? She's a lady of the night. - Do you know her? - Yes. Be my guest. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm? Sorry about your head. I didn't mean that. I just need about five minutes of your time. If I'm not back, they'll come looking for me. That's why I'm gonna get to the point. This is exchange of information. I need you to tell me what I need to know then I need you to tell Faisal what I want him to think. What do you want? I'm going to give you $10,000 cash. Why should I trust you? You don't really have much of a choice. Then, after you've done what I asked, I'm gonna give you another 10,000 cash just 'cause I like you so much. You said five minutes of my time? I think that's about all it'll take. Okay, what do you need? Is this the Oasis Hotel? This is Dr. Gray. Have my wife and son checked out yet? A message? Inside. Quickly. What are you doing here? I told you not to stop. I told you to keep going. He wouldn't let me leave you. It's not safe for you here. It's not safe out there, either. Besides, you're going to need some real fire power and I know where to get it. What about the boy? Who's gonna look after him? I can look after him. We won't be gone long. You gonna be alright? As soon as the car leaves... I know what to do. Good luck. Thank you. Be safe. What happened to you? The American. He sent a hooker to lure me away. You see him? I know where he is, or should I say where he's gonna be. How? I beat it out the filthy bitch. She fought back, but... The restaurant owner verifies your man's story. We should at least check the place out, colonel. Well, if this is all true, Ibo, tell me, why do you look so guilty? I didn't mean to hit her so hard. But... You killed her? Hmm? I'm impressed, Ibo. Now she can't tell the American that we're on to him. How many men can you give me? Five should be enough. Take care of it, Azimi. I'd like to get cleaned up, colonel. Be quick. You got what I asked for? Excellent. Benelli Super 90, exactly what the doctor ordered. You gonna be alright? So, what's the plan? Ibo says that Irena will probably be in Faisal's room all the time. His room? I know how that sounds. We're gonna have to hope for the best. Any reason you chose a place like this? It's a nice place. And there is a method to my madness. And this is a part of my method. This is a secret passageway courtesy of King Stanislav. Were you ever married, William? Oh, you're forever the detective, aren't you? You still haven't told me why. Why all of this for a girl you've never even met? You know, some of us have done bad things in the past. And once in a while we find something that makes us feel better about ourselves. This little girl means a lot to me. Take them out. Good evening. May I help you? The American, where's he at? The door at the end, the Japanese Room. Anybody else down there? No. Okay. Out. Now. Shit! You okay? Yes, I'm fine. Sounds like your friend's down, Billy Ray. We're down to the wire, Billy. Like the old saying goes, "Good guys finish last." You gone soft. Look where that got you tonight. Huh? Billy Ray? Lewis? You're playing a whore's game. You ain't nothing but a whore. You know what happens to whores, don't you? What? Whores always get fucked, don't they? You gonna fuck me, huh? Hey, Billy? I'm out. Ain't that a coincidence. I'm out too. See? So, uh, how do you wanna play this? Billy, it's your call, man. Look. Just like old times. Just me and you. Hey. I was just kidding. I was just kidding too. You okay? Go get the girl. You're sure? Yeah. Stand up. Get up! We're gonna take a little journey together. It's my favorite moment in life. What's that? It's when the predator becomes the prey. Also my favorite moment. But it remains to be seen who's the predator and who's the prey. It's okay. Don't be afraid. Who are you? You knew I'd come for you. You know, with these guns I can't really kill you slowly, and I'd like to. What, in front of the child? Exactly. So, why don't we settle this like men outside without the guns? Sure. This won't take long. You're right about that. I despise taking human life. I'm kind of embarrassed to admit the fact that I'm going to enjoy killing you slowly. My sentiments exactly. Dear Kasia, Nikki and I are finally safe and well in America. William sends his regards and thanks. William doesn't say very much. As you know, he's not one for words. He spends most of his time by himself, wandering the forest looking for injured animals. He seems to like it that way. At least now, though, he'll never be alone. All our love, Irena and Nikki. Where do you think he's flying to? Maybe he has a family too.
