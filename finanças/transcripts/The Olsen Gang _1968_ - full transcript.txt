We'll fix up the cigar shop on Mason Street. He always has money on Wednesdays: tips, payment. We wait until the night watch has done his round. We camouflage and be careful not to attract attention. We cut a hole in the window, to avoid the alarm. Kjeld provides a cutting diamond and tape, while Benny keeps watch - Shh! - Yes, I will. Hole must be taped down so it does not fall down and make a spectacle. Should unforeseen events occur, for God's sake do not run. Go quietly, as if it did not bother you. Well, Olsen. So we separate for now. - It will not last long. - I do not know. Maybe you will keep out of trouble? In the future we could meet under more amicable circumstances. Got a match? The same applies to the two gentlemen. It will be my privilege to follow the masters' comings and goings. It should be a pleasure to get gentlemen behind the starched curtains. If you were to do numbers, so it's not with me. - Goodbye, goodbye. - Matches. - What did you say? - Matches, do I have to beg? Sorry, you probably... You probably had not thought sorry. Maintained. - So it has not been easy. - It will get better. Egon will be damn fine. We have confirmation. It costs even if you are insured. Then came the little one. Yvonne could not work for four weeks. Birger is in the realm if not for Benny's scam at the racecourse Fucking Good. 400 for a fiver. It's gonna be different. I have plans. Big plans. Course. I've always said. Egon will be damn fine. Cheers, Egon. It's damn nice to see you again. - Just wait. Egon has a skideg - That's good. - How is it upstairs? - You still have both house and home. Conny has put crosses in the almanac every day for two years. - What is it? - Customers. Look yourself. - You should call home immediately. - So I better If you're kidding me... Egon, is that you, your little moped. Welcome home. You have become so small. They give nothing to eat, those stupid pigs? - Are you tired? - God, I am not. Moment, boys. Can you lend me a 25-penny? - Here you go. - Thank you. It is very good with Egon. I do not want, you are in the bulge. Where do you get money from? When has beer become free? And then you take the little sister. She's a child! But she's so great. She's sleeping like an angel. What? Yes, I would like to. A large Snevit in the bag. And two bunches of parsley. How about a half a raisin cake? No, of course. That's nonsense. Kjeld and Benny, meeting time. - Kjeld! - Yes. You come straight home. You keep from going upstairs. Hello, Egon. How is it so long ago. - You look the same. - He was a little pale beak. - You need to get him to Fatten up. - Never mind, lean taps. - Welcome home. - Thank you, girls. - Where is Ulla? - At work. - Ulla moved in last year. - It's our little movie star. She's my fiancee. I'm her manager. - Shouldn't we have a little one? - No, now you have to peel off. We have business. Bok-bok-bok - Come here, Kjeld. - Yvonne waiting. - Come on, we have things to talk about. - I certainly thought it was important. Yes, you sure as hell never been out for something so important. Look. Do you want to become millionaires? - How do you mean? - I have a great trick. We could use a few pennies. Listen. This is a business about millions. So many millions that we can all have a couple. - I'd better - Hold on, Kjeld. It's a big matter at international level. Is it porn? I knew it! Fucking great, Egon. I knew it. Ulla, my fiancee got offered a contract from abroad. - No, no, no! - Oh, no. Course. Is there anything I can help you with? They can very easily find it. It is divided into topics. Here we have department for ladies on gentlemen / gentlemen on ladies. And here we have for ladies on ladies, and there for gentlemen on gentlemen. And over there, the latest one with animals and so on. - What do you want, my little friend? - May I have a Donald Duck? I have to talk to my manager. Are you dizzy? With your talents, gifts, equipment? Aye, aye. - I promised not to sign. - They come from all over the world. - Do not go to waste. - Bye, bye. What action. Know what she has? Star quality. What the whole world yearns for. Aye, aye, aye'- - Sorry. - It does not matter. We are used to the gentlemen Being excited to be here. - It's you. - Yes, do you want my autograph? Detective Mortensen. Come with me. We must change our style. We need to expand our format. I took the opportunity studying methods abroad. We had library and a cinema in prison. - I'll have to go upstairs. - I have a meeting with Ulla. Do not worry. This time they get away. We get them eventually. Crime does not pay. Might as well quit now. We are on the trail of the traffickers. Before long the trap. Then it's about not getting stuck. Don't run me around the corner. Look at the example image. They say that the young man in the picture is your fiancee. But the young man in the picture can not possibly have taken the photograph - What do you say as to that? - Self-timer. (Phone) Mortensen here. Good day, sir. I have a witness interrogation. Sharp Inquiry ... Now, we're done. I have received valuable information. Yes, sir. I'll be right there. So you may go. Let it be a warning. You lucky bastard. We're done with them here. - What did he want? - I do not know. - He can not afford - He was very sweet. Benny, what about the contract? I can get 5,000. No, I have other plans, big plans. We need to change our style and expand our format. We'll go abroad start for ourselves. You have to keep your mouth shut about it, but in a few days daddy here will be a millionaire. - Are you sure? - Egon has a great trick. - Sir. - It is an important task. - I would not want to give this matter up. - I'll take it. Thank you. I have just found a very interesting case. - What is it about? - This one. - What is it? - The so-called Kejseropsats. One of the most splendid among The crown jewels of the Hohenzollers. On the occasion of the German Culture Week an exhibition of cultural relics. Kejseropsatsen is the main attraction. It is rated to 12 million kr. - What does it represent? - The basic idea is the virgin of Lorelei. She sits there in gold. In her hand she holds world's largest diamond. Under her runs the Rhine, reproduced in pearls, amethyst and emeralds. Over the diamond is a sacrificial bowl of pure gold. Emperor Wilhelm II used it to to keep his false teeth. It is not a question of money. There are national feelings at stake. Do not let it go wrong. It can have consequences: NATO, EC. Measures are being taken but the minister has asked me - - to let my most reliable and talented employee take custody. - Thank you. - I have great plans for you. The minister is personally interested in the case. God be with you. Sir. All doors and windows are secured from theft. The electrical grid is replaced. We have set "No Parking" signs to ensure visibility and control. As for the showcase With wishes to strengthen the thousand year old ties of friendship, - - which has resulted culturally - - It is my pleasure and honor to declare the exhibition open. It is a totally new design, which works as follows: - - touching the display case, sends the display down in a shaft. At the same time, alarms ring, - - and a signal goes directly to Police Headquarters and the German Embassy. I would venture to say that nothing can actually happen. I would like to see them, who dare to try. It will be an easy and pleasant job. One can sit here and watch it all. - Is there 12 million worth? - Ten. But be quiet and act normal! Not now, Olsen. You can just give up. - Is that you, Mr. Mortensen? - It can not be done. It's not for clumsy third rank amateurs like you. - You must have misunderstood something. - We are just at the exhibition. - We are very interested. - Is it forbidden to be cultural? Olsen, you just have to remember one thing: I am here all the time. God no. Mallorca. Is it really for real? Yes, yes. It should look like a regular holiday. Unbelievable! I have always wanted to go. - Ulla will be there also. - Oh no. It is one of the main principles. No women. - It's women who destroy everything. - Maybe I should not? - And what about the children? - Honey, do not do this. This is our chance of a lifetime. When it is finished, we are millionaires. If me and the kids do not come along, Kjeld is not allowed. Here we go and find every possibility, and then something funny happens All right, then we'll do it. - Also Ulla? - Yes, yes, in the name of God. There is a departure Wednesday 15:15. Benny provide tickets. Wednesday, I can not do. I have not a shred and must provide for children. The exhibition lasts only a week. - We can't afford that. - No, no, no! Try now to understand it. This is about millions. We can not hang us in small things. We need resourcefulness, boldness, courage and heart. Is it dangerous? Then Kjeld can not help. No, it's not dangerous, but it's hard, a big job. We have much to do, every second is costly from now until Wednesday. I have to see what clothes I have. Look. The most important thing is timing. - What? - Everything must be done in time. The coup takes place late Wednesday, so we can reach the airport - - before they discover what happened. It all has to be planned in detail. Benny takes care of the vehicles. We will also need Conny's pram. Kjeld, you... Kjeld! You must clean up tomorrow and cancel the milk and newspaper. And remember to go to the shoemaker. There are a thousand things to do. How do we achieve it? - 9 minutes and 27 seconds. - It can go faster. No. It must be realistic. (Horns) 26 seconds. 13 meters. They say that the west highway will go through this. The wagon has always been screwy. - What the hell is that? - Demolitions. - Is it dangerous? - Not at all. This is a directional one. So we are using a small charge. - We'll try 100 grams. - Fucking good, Egon. - We just 5 grams. - Good, Egon. Knippels Bro, 3:12. ENGLANDSVEJ 2:15. Water Tower, 1:40. Motorway, 2:20. 9:27. So everything should be clear. Everything has been measured, tested and timed. You each get a synchronized clock and a timetable to be followed. - Any questions? - What? - Some questions? - No. Can you buy perfume in the machine? - Can I get my pencils? - What are you doing with them? - Geometry. - We will travel tomorrow. I have my doubts. - Quiet, otherwise it will go wrong. - It is exactly what I mean. Let's see. Is there more? Girls and children take to the airport and wait for us. - Benny, you have the tickets? - Yes. They just need to be retrieved. - They cost 4,398 kr. - How much? 8 tickets to Palma de Mallorca, 4,398 kr. - Have you paid? - No, how could I? If we had money, there was no reason for this. - Why haven't you paid? - But how? Wasn't it your job? - Yes, but... - You thought maybe it was free? - I have no money. - Then you could have got some. We've got to get Ulla. - Hansen, is Ulla home? - Yes, yes. Ulla! I have thought about the contract. Sign it and grab the 5000. What a smart coat. Where did you get it from? - I have signed. - Have you? - You have?! - I couldn't wait. You understand, don't you ? - Well, so what? - Moment. Hansen, could you for old times' sake lend us... f.... 4,398 kr. Yeah... 4000 then? I never lend money. that's why I have so many friends. Yes, there is only one way left. No, not that. Not that! (Alarm clock rings) - I thought so. - We didn't mean to wake you. - Just sleep on, my boy. - Goodnight, Birger. Sleep well. - You forgot something. - It's smart with that bell. Do not play with your devices. You'll wake the baby sister. - What are you doing here in the middle of the night? - Numbers, but got caught. They were after my bankbook. - We just wanted to borrow it. - You're stealing from your own child! You have asked much of me, but to steal from your own flesh and blood...! - We need to get to Mallorca. - Not with my money. It's your father, you are talking to. You have to help some. - How old are you? - 14 Outstanding. The boy is underage and does not control his estate. The parents own it. The case is clear. See you tomorrow. The action starts at. 15 exactly. Good night. - Excuse me, do you know what time it is? - 15:15, my boy. No, it is 12 minutes past. Wait a minute. It's here. Quickly. Yes, yes. Fucking hell. Get a jigsaw, Kjeld. - We must try again. It didn't work. - We just lift it up again. Measuring tape, quickly. - Come on! - Yes, yes. 13 meters! Come on. You get it if you dare. (Alarm sounds) Oh damn! Hold on, Benny. Wire cutters, fast. - They will soon be here. - They are not coming. Soon, Birger. Of course Dad is coming. Ulla, here we are! - I have nausea and everything possible. - Me too, often. I have to go home to my mother. - Fucking Good. - I'm proud of you guys. - You are a genius. - We are 30 seconds behind. Keep going! Why the hell don't you drive? There is no more petrol. I do not understand. I came at a fiver. - What do we do? - Down the back. Quickly, now sit down with your father. - Do not park here. - No, we need to catch a flight. - May I see your driver's license? - Yes. It... What is this, Mortensen? Who triggered the alarm? I did not see them. I was outside on the street. - What were you doing there? - An illegal parking. What did I say? 90 degrees backlash gearing, defective brakes, tread wear, no stop lights. (German) Just calm, that's certainly just a misunderstanding, - - maybe a boy's prank. - I must transfer to Bonn. - Calm down, everything is alright. Hopefully, Mister Commissioner. Mortensen, are the borders blocked? This crime must be solved. I'm taking over the management. Keep me informed day and night. (Doorbell) Yes, yes, I'm coming. Devil to time. - Good evening, sir. - Mortensen? What the hell do you want? - I have a track. - At this time of night. It's pornography. Disrupting me in the middle of the night with that mess? - Coming, Hermann? - Yes, right away. - What is it? - A young lady with no clothes. A man... - I'm not blind, but how? - Self-timer, sir. - No, how is it a track? - Read the dedication. - "For Benny, thanks for tonight, Ulla." - One of the robbers must have lost it. - Probably Benny. The man there who... - Yes, thank you. Who is he? He is a member of the Olsen Gang. It is without doubt the Olsen Gang at hand. - No. It is an international issue. - But sir... - I have spoken to the press. - These are known offenders! Oh yes? Then we have to get these crooks. Even if it is a dead-end track, run after it. Keep me informed. (Female screaming) Good night, sir. Yes, yes, momma. I'm coming, Daddy's momma. - Should we give up? - Yvonne wants a divorce. - Ulla is not much for it eithere. - It's your fault! - It was an accident. - What's in a few dogs heads? As soon as the women whining, they become fearful and give up. - It's not like that... - But we will not give up! The battle is lost, but we can win, long as we stand together. We must act now, quickly, decisively and boldly. - Fucking good, Egon. - Are you with me? Come on. - Come on, come on. - Yes, yes. - Isn't it a bit close to the farm? - Come on. Help! Help! ' - Do not worry, Kjeld. - Look him in the eye. - It does not matter. - Lie still. Hello, who's there? Fucking Good. - Hey, guys. Have you seen the papers? - Come up and see. Where is he? Is he upstairs? Hansen, you can tell him that I said enough is enough. First he takes the boy's savings - - then he lets the baby sit alone in the street, while he is upstairs with those bitches. - Yvonne - No. I'm going home to mother. And right away, we're already packed. Police chief says there is a foreign criminal gang behind it. The coup was fantastical, beyond the capacity of Danish criminals. Who the hell writes this? - Mr. Bertelsen. - Such a lousy aphid. - What does he know about anything? - Stupid pig. They only count on on foreigners, Swedes, etc.. - Do not worry about it, Egon. - We'll show them. Come on boys. Where is he? Upstairs? Well, he'scoming. Hello, Ulla. Now let me explain. Don't be sad. - Ulla, hell! What is it? - I was at the doctor. I am pregnant. - It is yours, you klutz. - Really. And it is breach of contract, they say. I had to drop off the coat. - It's all ruined. - I can't understand how. Yes, it was that night, you remember. I couldn't do that. Self-timer didn't work. Here. I think we all need one. Cheers. It is true I should say goodbye to Yvonne. She went home to her mother. She was a little excited. That can't be right. - Is she gone? - She took the baby carriage and disappeared. - What should I do? - Kjeld, take it easy. Pram? After them. There they are. Stop in the Name of the King! - Where are they? - What will it be? Olsen Gang! Ha, there they are! Operator, Operator! Can you lend me 25 cents? We will not reach them on the main track. We have to catch them at a station. - How could she do that? - Not all thatflair. - You must not be bullied! - You shouldn't put up with everything. After all, those poor boys. We can't let them get caught. - He'll make things good again. - No. I never want to see him again. Jo. Otherwise you only get him. I'm on the trail of them, sir. Driving in a stolen car. I see. Getting after it, even if it is a dead-end track. We're looking at a very suspicious person of color. Not directly negro, but rather swarthy. - Speed up. - It's not going over 140 - Have you filled the gasoline? - Hell, no. - Yes, right here. - Quick, quick. - Mighty. - It will be 47.50, sir. - Do you have a phone, you can borrow? - Yes, there. Hey, stop, stop. There they are! - Go, man! - I can't with this piece of shit. - Master. - Yes. Forward. - Hi. Can we lend a hand? - Thank you. It never used to do it. - I live right over there. - It's probably just knob here. - Yeah, I'll just try to start it. - Thank you. I have to say that again, Thank you. There they are! - What is it now? - There is no petrol! - But you've just filled up. - Lord have mercy In the Name of the King. It's not them. I'm glad you came. I was just about to call you. (Phone) Yes? Yes Okay, we will set up a roadblock. What is the number? A Mercedes, AL 24 834 Outstanding. - Forward. - Can we wait? I need to go. No way. We'll take a short cut across. Careful. The police are after you. Hello. Mortensen here Fine. Oh, the carriage was empty? They must be nearby. Send your people. I am temporarily prevented. They must be arrested at any cost. They are very dangerous. Okay. Go out and get them. These are dangerous people, remember the slogan: Shoot first and ask questions afterwards. - Come on, Benny. Suck now. - It tastes like hell. - Benny, Ulla miss you. - She loves you. - Does she? - Suck! (Police Siren) What did the old guy say? Sex first and ask questions afterwards. It's them! You are under arrest. Everything you say will be used against you. You can't play games with me. Get in the truck. H2 call. Give me headquarters, the boss personally. Hello? Sir, Mortensen here. At this moment I have arrested the... It's one of ours. Open the blockade. It's probably the flying corps. There they are. Close the blockade. We have arrested a suspicious person. He drove a wagon designed for professional mischief, without a muffler. - He says he knows you. - Rude, let me talk to him. What? Is it you, Mortensen? Now you have to pull yourself together. I won't fix it all by myself We have arrested our man in the coup. Now get this affair sorted. Close it up. Come on, Mom. - Hey, stop, stop! - What do you say? - The pram is ours. - Do you have the proper luggage receipt? - Luggage receipt... No, give it! - I can not. - It's ours. - Not without a luggage receipt. We must get to Yvonne. Little darling, is that you? See kids, it's your father. - Can you forgive me? - Of course. How nice, we have our papa with us again. Now we're really going to grandma's to enjoy ourselves. Honey, do you have the receipt for the pram? - Why? - The others are out there, and we're gonna... - The others? - Egon and Benny will borrow the pram. - Is that why you came? - No. Yes, it is! Here I have been sitting unhappy and crying for hours. - I have also... - You came to steal the pram. Now we will be millionaires and go to Mallorca. Can I see your ticket? Are you paying for the two gentlemen out there? Me? No... Maybe my wife... Wife? I do not know this man. I have never seen him. He comes stumbling here and says he's a millionaire. You can't do that! Birger, Geoff, You know your father. If you don't have a valid ticket, you have to get off at the next station. They can't be transported without proper travel documents. - What now? - We might as well give up. No way. I have a plan. Benny, you go with Kjeld up in the baggage car. (Police Siren) Hello, hello? Sir, Mortensen here. I just want to.. Sir, there's a train coming! Hey, stop, stop in the King's name! On your way, man. - On your way, your kvajhead! - I can't do it with the møgpram! - I will not stand for more. - Shut up! Old shit. I surrender, I can't go anymore. I have a wife and dependent children. In the King's... - I'm not playing around anymore. - You should talk, amateur. - I'll be a father. - Yes, it's also going to be too stupid. You can drive your own old shit. - Run though! - I don't want to Help! Here comes the ferry. Don't give up now. We must stand together. This is our chance of a lifetime. What we dreamed of and fought for. We have suffered, struggled, sweat, cried, bled, fought and striven. We have done it together, unity and harmony. We can not let all that down now with the goal within reach. Now that we have the reward in our praying, grateful hands. Just look. Benny, come home. We got an apartment in Brøndbyøster. (Horns) Mortensen, you have disappointed me deeply. Their reports are misleading. And now you tell me that you have wrecked a piano. You waste time, while I have to do it all alone. Go back to Copenhagen and sign up as a street cop. I'll take it even matter. (Phone) Yes, it's the police? What did you say? A piano transport truck? I thought it was weird to buy a moving car for 5 kr. He wanted a ferry ticket. -When is the ferry? -In 7 minutes. -I'll be right there. After him. Get him dead or alive. Good day. I found a package. I would like a receipt, if there is reward money. Run!
