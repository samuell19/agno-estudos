(suspenseful music) - [Narrator] Hollywood, California, (group chattering) a small theater company readies for the performance of an ambitious new work based on a classic text. Is it Shakespeare or Sophocles? - [Man] Line backstage, please. - [Narrator] None of the above. - It's reefer madness! Reefer madness! - [Narrator] It's "Reefer Madness." - No! We're all gonna die. (thunder rumbling) - [Narrator] In it's original incarnation as a theatrical film, "Reefer Madness" was an early prototype for a sensationalistic brand of filmmaking that flourished in America for decades. ♪ Reefer madness ♪ Reefer madness "Reefer Madness: The Musical" was just one example of how the controversial and misfit movies of yesterday can become the mainstream entertainments of today. ♪ Till the devil ♪ Reefer madness What follows is the story of that strange alchemical process of a secret cinema and the men and women who brought it to life. (women screaming) (audience applauding and cheering) Question, what is an exploitation movie? - There has never been a good answer to what is an exploitation movie. Some people would say it's something that exploits the subject matter, other people would say it's something that exploits the audience. I would say it's probably somewhere in between or a combination of both. (suspenseful music) - Anything was permissible for an exploitation picture, as long as it was in bad taste. (woman laughing ominously) - It was just unheard of. Society was alarmed and delighted. (suspenseful music) - We did make them in six days. I remember once, later on, when we got seven or eight days to make a movie, we said, "What are we gonna do with the extra time?" (weapon whirring) - The ideal world for a teenager is a parentless existence. (motorcycle engines droning) (dramatic music) - Now that you bought me, what do you want me to do? - 'Cause we were making money while they were dropping dead at the box office. - You say to me that I made exploitation films and I say to you that every film is an exploitation film; because as soon as you advertise something, you're exploiting it. Do you agree? (suspenseful music) (thunder rumbling) - Gee whiz. - [Narrator] The second world war was the great and transforming event of 20th century American life. (audience cheering and applauding) Thanks to wartime mobilization, the society a generation went overseas to defend had vanished in its absence. Returning GIs were ready to invent a new world for themselves, and they may even have believed it would resemble the one that preceded it, but it couldn't. They had witnessed too much not to have been changed by what they saw. (sorrowful music) (torpedo fires) (bomb explodes) The pent-up sexual energies of four long bloody years of combat and separation found immediate expression in a post-war reproductive frenzy that came to be called the Baby Boom. - The period in the '50s and '60s was a period of unparalleled abundance. On the whole, the generation that came back from World War II came back to a fat country, and the GI Bill and all these things allowed a lot of people to become homeowners quick. So you had this sense of a kind of paradisiacal sense of entitlement. - [Narrator] Beneath the general euphoria of prosperity and plenty, darker currents circulated as well. (Maila screaming) - That wasn't a good one. (laughs) - [Man] It sounded pretty good to me. - (laughing) That was the wrong one. - [Narrator] In 1954, Los Angeles audiences attuned to the strange new medium of live television discovered and even stranger entity invading their living rooms. The show was a local sensation, and its hostess was a necrophiliac's delight who went by the stage name Vampira. From its opening shot, "The Vampira Show" promised audiences something different. And Maila Nurmi, the girl behind the ghoul, made sure it delivered. - Well, initially the viewer sees a long corridor with many candelabra and dry ice, and far away a doorway which opens. (screams) They can hear it where down at the end of the corridor. And then far away they see this infanta silhouette slowly approaching through the mist, slowly approaching through the mist. (animal howling) And as it gets close enough, the viewer sees that it's a creature apparently in a trance drifting closer, closer, closer to the camera. And when she reaches, almost reaches the viewer, she suddenly screams a blood-curdling scream, (screams) and then says, "Screaming relaxes me so," as if she's having just had an orgasm. I mean, that was my thought, and that was what I was trying to imply in a lady like manner. (laughs) - [Narrator] Here, on this small local show created to showcase bargain basement horror films in a late night comedy format, sex and death, two American obsessions often suppressed from the wider culture of the day, arrived in one outrageous and alluring package. - According to a report not yet confirmed, a beast of seemingly gigantic proportions has been cited lurking in the hills due northeast of town. - [Narrator] Television itself was one of several factors terrorizing the Hollywood movie-making community in the mid-1950s. The majors put up a brave front at first, but as millions of viewers began choosing Uncle Miltie and "I Love Lucy" over a night at the movies, a kind of controlled panic began to set in. - indicating that the monster has some strange power of rapid growth. - [Narrator] Though available only locally, "The Vampira Show" was written up in Newsweek, pictorialized in Life Magazine, spawned fan clubs all over the world. Nurmi's act was imitated on stations in every city in America. - Every major city seemed to have one, and they'd come on first and tell jokes about the movies and then launch into the picture. Maybe it was to make it a little more palatable for those PTA groups and the people who said, "No, we shouldn't have these kinds of things, not even in the movies, let alone on television in everybody's living rooms." - I know with me, it was just... I was rebelling. Intense, it was a violent rebellion. And I was not alone, obviously. This whole thing was seething. People wanted to be unloose, they wanted some freedom, freedom of expression, freedom of everything, you know? Less hairspray. (laughs) - [Narrator] The question was: Freedom for whom? And revolution against what? (suspenseful music) (animal howling) Television wasn't Hollywood's only headache by 1954. Throughout the early '50s, a late '40s court decision was in the process of breaking up the studio system's virtual monopoly on premium American theater space. For the first time in modern screen history, finding an audience for large scale, independent film distribution became a viable possibility. - There were all of these problems in the motion picture world, from the divorcement decrees and all these other things, that were creating havoc. And we knew that there was an opportunity. - [Narrator] American International Pictures was one of the first production outfits to recognize the advantages of the situation. Created as American Releasing in 1954 by a lawyer turned producer, Samuel Z. Arkoff and his partner, former exhibitor, Jim Nicholson, AIP quickly realized that it's cheaply made movies couldn't compete directly with A-list studio titles. The answer was simple but transforming. Service a skew of the market that was uninterested in the serious minded, adult themed star vehicles the studios specialized in and address concerns and subject matters no supposedly reputable producer would touch. - We made "I Was a Teenage Werewolf," "I Was a Teenage Caveman," "I was a Teenage Frankenstein." The word teenage, to the best of my knowledge, had never appeared on any picture throughout the world prior to that time, because the teenagers had never been recognized as other than a category of children. - [Narrator] A key component of the AIP business strategy was what used to be called ballyhoo. In a radical departure from standard practice, film titles and marketing campaigns were usually devised before a script or even a premise for a script existed, often allowing AIP to turn a profit via pre-sales before a foot of film was shot. - We didn't have big stars. We didn't have bestselling books. We didn't have big plays. So what did we have? We had titles and we had artwork, and that's what we sold. - Arkoff and Nicholson we're aided from the first by a brilliant independent filmmaker named Roger Corman. - He was, at the time, I thought, a great producer. I think he went to Stanford and took a business course and got his money's worth. - [Narrator] After a brief and disappointing stint as a script reader at Fox, Corman set himself up as an independent producer. That he had virtually no assets with which to make films seemed to disturb him not at all. - I rented the reception room of a producer who didn't really have any money and couldn't afford his rent. I paid $25 a month for his reception room with the understanding that whenever he had an important meeting, I would get out of the reception room so it looked like he had the full office. (suspenseful music) (woman screaming) - [Narrator] Remarkably, a pattern of speed and economy that would endure for most of Corman's professional life emerged from the start of his career. - We did make them in six days. I remember once, later on, when we got seven or eight days to make a movie, we said, "What are we gonna do with the extra time?" (thunder cracking) - [Man] From billions of light years away, I approach your planets. - [Narrator] The cheapness of '50s exploitation films has become the stuff of legend, and even accounts for much of their interest to a latter day fan base that finds humor in the occasionally amateurish performances, the almost always ragged production values. - Roger Corman contacted me, he said, "I'm making a film called 'A beast With 1,000,000 Eyes,' and I need the beast. Is there anybody you could recommend to me?" And I immediately thought of Ray Harryhausen, the great animator, and he said, "Oh my God, I couldn't afford him. Why, he charges $10,000, a tentacle!" (creature screaming) (weapon whirring) - [Narrator] But if short production schedules and limited resources where liability in one sense, they could also be an asset. - Darryl Zanuck once said that the best way to find ideas for movies was just read the front page of your newspaper. They would call these movies ripped from the pages of the paper, ripped from today's headlines. And that tradition had kind of died out in the mainstream Hollywood, but it was kept up by Corman and other low budget filmmakers who could respond very quickly. - [Narrator] Corman second feature as a producer brought him into contact with Sam Arkoff and Jim Nicholson, in a teaming that would change the course of all three men's lives. - I did a road racing picture called "The Fast and the Furious" with John Ireland and Dorothy Malone. Jim Nicholson and Sam Arkoff, who were starting American Releasing at the time, talked to me and asked if they could take the film and I said, "Yes, if you can give me a three picture deal." They agreed to that because they really had no company. - [Narrator] By his third production, Corman had taken the next logical step by moving into direction, it was a role he would take with increasing seriousness, in which he would eventually become a recognized master of the exploitation form. - I started as a writer, then became a writer/producer, then became a producer/director, and then I really thought of myself as primarily a director who also produced. - I think Roger basically is a producer, and the reason he became a director is because he could never get a director to bring a picture in as cheap as he could do it himself. (bouncy music) - [Narrator] The major exploiteers of the era soon found themselves on the teenage side of a widening cultural divide. With the teens' eye view came a kind of commercially mandated paranoia about the adult generation, a worldview where governments lie, parents stifle and underestimate their children, and where only the young see life for what it is. (alien shrieking) - The ideal world for a teenager is a parentless existence, no parents to shouted at them, no parents to lecture at them, no adults to rule them, to teach them, to mock them, to jail them, that was really what it was on about. - Five, four, three, two, one, fire! (bomb explodes) - [Narrator] At the same time, the silver lining of post-war prosperity came with its own dark technological cloud. Though mainly an underground literary form before the 1950s, science fiction seemed suddenly to make a lot more sense as mass entertainment given the unprecedented predicament the world had to live with after 1945, the possibility of absolute annihilation. - I was the resident crazy in high school. Everybody ridiculed young Forree Ackerman who thought men were going to the moon and someday there will be atomic power and television. And the world's eyes had to be opened when the two atomic bombs fell, one of the great predictions of science fiction. - [Narrator] In a misguided effort at military preparedness, a whole generation of American school children was traumatized by such government propaganda efforts as "Duck and Cover," which encouraged its young audience to remain aware at all times that their entire world might vanish in a radioactive flash. ♪ He'd duck and cover ♪ Duck and cover - [Narrator] That signal means to stop whatever you are doing and get to the nearest safe fast. Always remember, the flash of an atomic bomb can come at any time, no matter where you may be. Betty is asking her teacher, "How can we tell when the atomic bomb may explode?" and her teacher is explaining that there are two kinds of attack, with warning and without any warning. If you were not ready and did not know what to do, it could hurt you in different ways. It could knock you down hard, or throw you against a tree or a wall. It is such a big explosion, it can smash in buildings, and knock signboards over, and break windows all over town. (man screaming) (music drowns out speaker) - [Narrator] Is it any wonder that when '50s exploiteers projected that same young audiences dreams back at it a few years later, they often created nightmares. - [Narrator] What happens to our world if massive, monstrous man bests like this invade us? - The low budget films tapped into the fears of most of the population. And we were very fearful at the time. I remember in 1953, I was watching Jerry Lewis and Dean Martin on TV making jokes about atomic bombs, and I was so terrified I ran upstairs and pulled a blanket over my head. - Get over here. It crept into the yard once. - [Narrator] Clearly, the exploitation film could hold a certain segment of America's attention. But given the constraints of time and money exploiteers work with, and the relative inexperience of the average exploitation filmmaker, the question can be fairly asked: Was meaningful work of enduring quality possible within the exploitation format? - Meaningful is... Well, that's deep, see? You're looking for something that may not exist there. - [Narrator] Then the answer depends on your point of view. - What's locked behind that door? - [Narrator] Case in point, "The Brain That Wouldn't Die." To a certain type of movie fan, director Joseph Green's underfunded 1959 feature is simply a sublime example of the so-bad-it's-good aesthetic. Undeniably amateurish in many respects, the film is a shoe string rehashing of the Frankenstein paradigm in which a mad scientist wrecks a car, kills this fiance, and then keeps her severed head alive while he tries to find it a new body. - Let me die. Let me die. - I've had success with transplants, now I can do it for her. - [Narrator] Yet in its own weird way, "The Brain That Wouldn't Die" can be interpreted as bizarre feminist allegory today. As the evil and obsessed Herb Evers cruises strip bars and beauty pageants looking for the body he'd like to drug, murder, and then spend the rest of his life with, it is the objectification of women which the film itself revels in that also supplies its horror. - She has the second nicest body I've ever seen. - Second to you? - No, another girl, a figure model. You remember that one in school years ago? - [Man] Figure model. Poses for art classes. The nicest body she's ever seen. The nicest body. - Bill, you put something in my drink, didn't you? - Could "The Brain That Wouldn't Die's" makers have meant for such abstract ideas to be drawn from their work? Almost surely not. Does that negate the possibility that they're present anyway? Not necessarily. - Here are these films that are being popped out in three days, five days, six days, ridiculous speeds when you think about it. (thrilling music) The furious energy of that, among other things, forbids the maker to judge what he or she is making. All you can do is let it straight up from your unconscious. (thrilling music) - I told you to let me die. - Don't you want to join in the things that other people do? - I don't seem capable of being very close to people. (organ music) - [Narrator] More self-consciously artful films were also possible in the exploitation format. In 1962, industrial filmmaker named Herk Harvey made his first and only feature, an allegorical ghost story about a disaffected church organist who mysteriously survives an auto accident. In Harvey's hands, "Carnival of Souls" became an eerily beautiful and sustained metaphor for solitude and loneliness; as caught in some uncertain borderland between life and death, it's alienated protagonist reaches out too late for human contact. - Why can't anybody hear me? - [Narrator] If a European director like Alain Resnais had made "Carnival of Souls," it might've been praised for its eerie existential imagery, lauded for its literate screenplay, perhaps received multiple awards. Because the film was nominally an exploitation title, it instead played out of the way drive-ins, barely returning on Harvey's investment. (ominous music) (wind whooshing) (water splashes) "Carnival of Souls" languished for over two decades as a neglected and forgotten work before a revival of interest in the late 1980s crowned it an unsung masterpiece. - I, I got a new one. - Crazy. What is it called? - Um, "Murdered Man." - [Narrator] One of the most interesting Corman titles of the period can also hold up under serious analysis. (dramatic music) A black comedy scripted by frequent Corman collaborator, Charles B. Griffith, 1959's "A Bucket of Blood," concerns the misadventures of Walter Paisley, a nebbishy waiter with no creative ability, who yearns for acceptance from the in-crowd at the beatnik coffee house where he works. - (laughs) Nobody asked for your opinion, Walter. You're just a simple little farm boy and the rest of us are all sophisticated dignits. - Walter has a clear mind. One day something will enter it, feel lonely, and leave again. - [Narrator] An accidental murderer, Paisley literally covers up his crimes by encasing them in clay, and finds the disturbing sculptures that result praised by the same artistic snobs who formerly rejected him. - And I think "Bucket of Blood" is, in coded form, Roger's spiritual autobiography. Here you have a fellow who the whole world thinks is a geek, he has a passion to create that will not be stopped, and it consumes a lot of the snobs that would otherwise dismiss him, and at the same time it's received as very powerful art, and he lives in fear of being unmasked as a fraud throughout. (dramatic music) - Where are you going, Carla? What's the matter? - Walter, there's a body inside that statue. - Oh, well, that's Alice. - [F. X.] These are, I think, primal fears that any director could relate to. - Let them become clay in his hands that he might mold them. - I had heard this before that there had been a review of a rerelease of "Bucket of Blood" up in San Francisco, and they try to compare the character, my character, and Roger's career. - When did you do this, Walter? - Last night. It doesn't take me very long. - I don't think that's what it was though. I don't think it was that at all. - It's very possible that "Bucket of Blood," on an unconscious level, is somewhat autobiographical. The young artist who exploits violence and then becomes fearful that he's being recognized for the exploitation rather than for his own true artistic ability. - I'll hide where they'll never find me. - I do think that anybody who's working in a creative medium is working partially out of their conscious mind and partially out of their unconscious mind. - [Narrator] By the end of the 1950s, the teenage exploitation film had unquestionably come of age. It had also become an intensely competitive field to work in, a fact both Corman and AIP took note of. (sorrowful music) - [Man] I suppose he would have called it "Hanging Man," his greatest work. - Well, we began to get a lot of competition in those cheap black and white pictures. So we finally said, "Look, let's make one picture for the money we were otherwise spending for two pictures. So let's take the 200 to $300,000 and let's make a picture that will play top of the bill; and then we'll sell, again, for a flat price, one of our pictures that had already played off." - So I said, "Why don't you let me have 15 days. I'll shoot in color. And I'll do one film, and it will stand on its own." And they asked me what I wanted to do, and I said "The fall of the House of Usher." And after a little bit of discussion, I think they were ready to gamble on a slightly bigger picture, too. - [Narrator] The first in a series of popular films based on the writings of Edgar Allan Poe. 1960's "The Fall of the House of Usher" marked a turning point for both AIP and Corman, a lush period film shot in color. And with a name actor in Vincent Price, it was also arguably a move beyond the strict exploitation formula AIP helped pioneer, the proof that Arkoff, Nicholson, and Corman had mastered their craft and their business and were now capable of creating works that could compete directly in the mainstream. (dramatic music) (woman screaming) The victory was an earned one; and the away from more topical subjects, temporary. But elsewhere on the exploitation scene, the same combustible elements of ambition and opportunism that defined exploitation's teenage era were poised to shake things up all over again. (ominous music) (thunder cracking) - I have some pictures here that were made just for folks like you. You're going to sit quietly and look at them, and never again will you ever think of sex as anything but something wonderful, miraculous, almost divine. (dramatic music) - [Narrator] By 1960, American International Pictures loomed over the world of exploitation like an indie Colossus. But for all the social fireworks their movies occasionally ignited, there were certain areas of content which AIP and its competitors simply could not address, chief among these were nudity and sex. As always, exploitation abhorred a commercial vacuum. For a new breed of exploiteer whose roots stretched all the way back to the erotic peep shows of the silent era, the fact that there was a topic of great public fascination no one else was dealing with made for an irresistible opportunity. - The sex would be the one thing that wasn't being exploited quite so heavily by the main Hollywood studios, and so that was the one thing they had to sell. - [Narrator] And in guessing that the frank treatment of sex held enormous profit potential, the next wave of exploitation filmmakers wasn't exactly shooting in the dark. (film roll rattling) By the late 1950s, cinematic sex had been officially marginalized for close to three decades. In 1921, the Motion Picture Producers and Distributors of America was formed by the major Hollywood studios to avoid outside censorship. In 1930, the MPPDA's production code began barring mainstream Hollywood from dealing with topics including venereal disease, prostitution, sexual perversion, adultery, nudity, drug trafficking, profanity, suggestive dancing, and the ridiculing of religion. Since only major studios were constrained by the code's restrictions, the reaction from the independence was instantaneous. Cheap, sensationalistic movies began circulating from town to town, territory to territory, offering audiences titillating subject matters the studios had grown too timid to show. - Subjects such as, oh, a birth of a baby, venereal disease, miscegenation, dope, alcoholism, all of the no-no subjects, anything was permissible for an exploitation picture as long as it was in bad taste. - [Narrator] Distributors of such product were necessarily gypsies, ready to skip town at the flash of a sheriff's badge. A term was coined to describe their vagabond lifestyle, the road showman had been. - Road showing was the supreme example of exploitation. You came into town like a carnival, you stayed a couple of days and you got out of town, just like a traveling carnival. - [Man] Smoke, Mary. - [Mary] Thanks. (laughs) - [Narrator] The explosion of American drug use in the 1960s made cult classics out of cautionary tales of narcotic excess like Dwayne Espers "Reefer Madness," originally produced as a church sponsored anti-drug film entitled "Tell Your Children." Audiences far more informed than the film's makers about the effects of marijuana laugh at "Reefer Madness" today. - Naturally they're laughing at them today because they're so corny, but they weren't laughing at them back in the '30s. A lot of people of my generation never tried marijuana because we had seen these pictures. - [Narrator] This is the wonder story of life. - [Narrator] A less well remembered roadshow genre kept sex before the public through the '30s and '40. Sex hygiene pictures, also called clap operas, were a bizarre hybrid of fiscal opportunism and genuine reformers concerns over social ills like unwed motherhood and venereal disease. In the guise of sex education, audiences might see anything from partial and/or full frontal nudity to closeups of syphilitic sex organs, with natural and surgically induced childbirth often supplied as a chaser. - The birth of a baby film was perfect road showing. It wasn't just a matter of showing them a picture. We'd have nurses in uniforms. We'd have an ambulance out front. We didn't just give them a picture, we gave them a show. At a certain point, we show them the birth of a baby, both a normal birth and then a ceasarean section. And guys passed out like flies watching the ceasarean section. And then we showed them something, we showed them a VD reel, and that, that got to all of them. - [Narrator] To confuse local censors, the tone was both high moral and relentlessly clinical, which makes the erotic appeal of such films difficult to determine today. - Are we healthy enough to get married. - You're both as solid as a new dollar. Sally, that first baby didn't hurt you a bit, you can have a dozen more if you want to. And, Bob, you'll be pleased to know that there's no trace of your old VD, 100% cured. What did you say about a first baby? - David F. Friedman had a hand in distributing several of the most well-known sex hygiene titles in the 1950s. He describes the sex hygiene genre as something of a bait and switch. - They all thought they were gonna come in and see beautiful nude people, but they saw the results of sex, and they came out a little shaken up, but nobody ever asked for their money back. How do you sell sex anyway? I don't care what you... It's the curiosity factor. No one has ever had their curiosity totally satisfied when it comes to sex. - [Narrator] By the 1950s, America's curiosity about sex was at an all time high. The advent of the inexpensive paperback book meant that furtively distributed adults only novels were beginning to circulate, serving a function not unlike pornographic videos today by bringing sex-based storylines into a certain kind of American home. - The whole notion of a sexual revolution, this isn't something it started with the Summer of Love, and peace and love, and hippies, and that sort of notion; in fact, that's sort of the terminal point. That's when people's kids found out about the sexual revolution. I sometimes call it a bachelors' revolution or a swingers' revolution that was happening in the early to mid '50s, really. It's that Second World War generation, particularly men of very homosocial sensibility that started this revolution. And things like Playboy Magazine, for instance, which are a phenomenon of the '50s, this is the beginning. - [Narrator] There were other raw forms of sexual content available to magazine readers of the era as well. Some, like the fetish minded Bizarre, or the erotic literary review "American Aphrodite," even attempted to pass themselves off as journals of ideas, albeit within a narrow range. (dramatic music) By contrast, movies were lagging way behind. Europe came to the rescue in the form of Brigitte Bardot. Building on a string of U.S. court decisions permitting the exhibition of such high-minded but centrally charged European product as "Bitter Rice" and Roberto Rossellini's "The Miracle," Bardot arrived as the young, briefly unclad star of Frenchmen Roger Vadim's "And God Created Woman." In the art house cinemas, all hell broke loose. - This was the picture that changed all of those so-called art theaters into adult theaters. You remember we had an art theater, it was those theaters where all the intellectuals and the pseudo-intellectuals went in and they drank lousy instant coffee in the lobby, and they talked about all these esoteric things. And then suddenly in comes this picture with this little French cupcake with this beautiful bear derriere; and suddenly, all day long, guys are drifting into the theater, the raincoat crowd, they cloak and suit crow, the briefcase... And the exhibitors saying, "My God, how long has this been going on?" - [Narrator] With the exploiteers' penchant for extremes, the groundwork for a far more excessive and uniquely American use of nudity was already being laid, courtesy of Walter Bibo, a New York based producer of burlesque short subjects. In 1954, Bibo shot a film called "Garden of Eden" set in a Florida nudist camp. When the film was banned in New York, he won a 1957 court battle based on a narrow ruling that boiled down to the fact that since nudist camps existed, simply depicting them could not be construed as obscene. (dramatic music) New York, the most significant movie market in America was suddenly awash in cinematic tributes to the wholesome, recreational joys of the nudist way of life. The sexploitation film had arrived. (jazzy music) We pause here upon the first incline of what some still view as a slippery slope. Decades after their demise, sexploitation films remain a subject of controversy. (jazzy music) To the makers of this documentary, criticizing sexploitation for featuring nudity is akin to criticizing a musical for bursting into song. Nudity was the sexploitation film's commercial reason for being, the saleable commodity that enabled latter day adults only pictures to draw a mostly male, mostly middle-aged audience to cheap, quickly made productions, and thereby to return a predictable profit. (jazzy music) While sex was therefore undeniably the sexploitation films' great theme, what sexploitation had to say on the subject was as varied as the companies producing the films themselves and the personalities making them. (jazzy music) If the attitudes the films reflect may in some cases no longer be fashionable, it could be argued this makes them all the more valuable as cultural artifacts. (jazzy music) So shudder if you will, turn away if you must, but keep in mind as you do so that the films we now turn to were made and seen by the hundreds, week by week, month by month, for 15 of the most tumultuous years in American movie history. They need no more strident defense than to say that they exist, and to move on from there. (jazzy music) That the truth of the matter is more complex than meets the eye, is demonstrated by the fact that one of the earliest and most dedicated followers of Bibo's lead was a New York based filmmaker named Doris Wishman. - And I was a frustrated actress, which is... I suppose I still am, you know, it never really leaves you. I went to drama school with Shelley Winters, and I was far better than she, I really was; however, she pursued her career and I didn't, and that's the difference, so here I am. - [Narrator] Prior to turning to filmmaking, Wishman had worked on the distribution of Bibo's "Garden of Eden" and seen it firsthand how profitable the movie had been. But it wasn't a chance for a quick buck that was her primary motivation for moving into filmmaking, it was the aftermath of personal tragedy. - My first film was "Hideout in the Sun," and that was produced almost 40 years ago. I didn't really know what I was doing, and that's the truth. I guess I still don't; but, in any event, I didn't then. It was after my husband died that I decided to make a film 'cause I felt that it would keep me so busy 'cause I would go to bed at night and pretend I had a date with... You know, sick thinking! I had a guilt complex, you know, the usual. And so my sister gave me the $10,000, and I shot, and it was bad. But when I went to bed at night, instead of thinking that I had a date with my husband, I would think, "Well, if I pay Pearl back $10 a week for the rest of my life, I'll return the money." - According to Wishman biographer, Michael Bowen, the therapeutic impulse behind Whitman's nudist camp films makes them thematically unique. - Doris's a husband, as I understand, had passed away in 1959. And she made nudist camp films, of course, for the first five years, six years after he had passed away. These films express a very different desire; a desire, I would say, for the return of that husband, 'cause all these films were love stories about people meeting their love partner. - Nudist films have no sex in them, at least they shouldn't, and they're not supposed to, and they didn't, none that I saw. Do you have to show sex to be in love? I mean, somebody gives you a flower because he loves you, that's just much more exciting than sex. I'm giving everybody the wrong impression. I'm normal. I've had my quota, let's put it that way. Hey, that's a good title, Michael. "I've Had My Quota," isn't it? - She wanted to make these love stories, but she needed to in a way that was commercial. So what she did is she figured, "Well, the gimmick will be that it will all be happening in the nude." But it really didn't have to happen in the nude, it could have happened anywhere. Now, I think that's very different from what motivated most of the other people who made these films; as far as I know, they were all men by and large. And so I think that's very significant. - "Hideout in the Sun" proved profitable enough to encourage Wishman in what even she acknowledges were fledgling efforts, and she quickly moved forward with a second film. Science fiction was still a mainstream exploitation staple, and topical curiosity about the brand new American space program had raised interest in space exploration to an all time high. - We choose to go to the moon in this decade and do the other this- - [Narrator] John F. Kennedy would momentarily make it a matter of official national policy that America would be the first country to put a man on the moon; but nobody had gone there yet, which meant the possibilities were endless. (suspenseful music) For all anyone knew, the moon's surface might look like just about anything, including Sunny Palms, a sun dappled nudist camp located near Miami, Florida. - [Woman] I have someone do all ear for a most important matter. ♪ I'm mooning over you ♪ My little moon doll - [Narrator] Erotic space fantasies were nothing new. Straight exploitation had already given the world "Queen of Outer space," "Cat-women of the Moon," and countless variations on the theme back in the 1950s. But by blending interstellar sirens with a nudist camp plot line; Wishman, perhaps inadvertently, took a science fiction motif that dated all the way back to the earliest pulp magazines and exploded its sexual subtext for all the world to see. As with many exploitation films, "Nude on the Moon's" following breaks down into those who choose to laugh at the filmmaker's perceived ineptitude and those who find a kind of cock-eyed primal poetry in an unschooled, but heartfelt approach to a medium that often seems to be suffocating under the weight of faceless craftsmanship. As with most of her features, Wishman produced, wrote, directed, and designed the promotion for "Nude on the Moon," it was her film all the way. And its central preoccupation, as in all nudist camp features, was nudity as a metaphor for true love. ♪ A nymph in the pale moonlight ♪ ♪ I pine for you, my little moon doll ♪ So who's to say that, on its own terms, what she gave us wasn't beautiful? - I can't believe it. You are here on earth. I didn't lose you after all. ♪ For it's you who makes the moon so bright ♪ - [Narrator] Wishman stuck with nudist camp pictures for eight films before trying her hand at other things. Other sexploiteers were a lot less devoted to the form. - The so-called nudist colony films were not really entertainment, per se, they were just nudity for the sake of nudity. It was just a lot of people running around naked, so I never considered them to be competitive to our products. - Going through a nudist colony is about as erotic as walking through the cold storage room of Swift and Company in the Chicago stockyards. Anytime you were making a nudist camp picture, you had better bring your own nudists. (laughs) - [Narrator] Dave Friedman, like Wishman, was in the process of coming into his own. A product of the Hollywood studio system, Friedman had turned his back on a major promotion in the Exploitation Division at paramount pictures to throw in his lot with a road showman named Kroger Babb, whose "Mom and Dad" was one of the most successful exploitation movies ever made. - Kroger Babb as one of those few geniuses that knew how to get to Mr. and Mrs. Average-American. He could write copy... Yeah, I know today all of the ad agencies say, "Oh, what cornball stuff this is." But people read that copy and they went out to see what Krog had to offer. - [Narrator] Accounts vary, but it's estimated by some that the combined grosses for film admissions and a sexually explicit medical pamphlet hawked by bogus physicians at "Mom and Dad's" screenings exceeded $100 million during the 25 year life of the film. - And the other thing he did, more so than anything else, that picture was a prime target of the Legion of Decency, which was an agency of the Catholic Church. Mr. Babb fought them tooth and nail 440 some odd times in court, and in that way was one of the very early leaders in making motion pictures have the same freedom of the press as the printed word. He was in pioneer in first amendment rights for film. That's why you should care about Kroger Babb. - [Narrator] Friedman, who had relocated to Chicago from Los Angeles, outlasted his mentors prime, and had into independent production by the early 1960s in partnership with a novice filmmaker named Herschell Gordon Lewis. It was a teaming which, for impact and influence in the exploitation field, can withstand a certain kind of comparison to AIP's Sam Arkoff and Jim Nicholson. - Herschell and I were... If we weren't the Barnum and Bailey of film, we were the Hagenbeck and Wallace, or the Sells and Floto, those were smaller circuses that existed in the time of Barnum and Bailey. We were a team, we did everything together. - [Narrator] After two marginally profitable collaborations called the "Prime Time" and "Leaving Venus," Friedman and Lewis came into their own with a movie and a new sexploitation genre called the nudie-cutie, its title was "The Adventures of Lucky Pierre." - And for $7,500, we made "The Adventures of Lucky Pierre," 35 millimeter color. And Herschell was the director and the camera man, I was the producer and the sound man, and we parlayed that 7,500 plus another 20,000 for prints and advertising into about $250,000, and we were in business. - [Narrator] The nudie-cutie had been pioneered by a maverick Playboy photographer and sometime industrial filmmaker named Russ Meyer, whose first feature, "The Immoral Mr Teas," had grossed an amazing $3.5 million off a budget of 24,000 beginning in 1959. - Russ Meyer's movies are Molotov cocktails in the sexual revolution, they detonated the barriers of what movies could show sexually. - [Narrator] And like the sex hygiene films before them, nudie-cuties were even capable of performing a certain educational function. - And Meyer brought the whole nudie-cutie genre into being with "The Immoral Mr. Teas," which I think I snuck into when I was about 14. And when you were going through puberty, this was really interesting to see little flashes of nudity here and there. It was very mild, and people today would think it was not much; but back then, it was very hard for kids to get any sense of what the human body was like. - [Announcer] See "The Wonderful World of Girls." - [Narrator] The first nudie-cuties had roots in a number of pop culture artifacts, including Mack Sennett's silent bathing beauty comedies, and that salacious form of live American theater called burlesque. (playful jazz music) The cheesecake men's magazines of the '40s, though devoid of nudity, had showcased young women in a variety of comedic photo narratives after the style of European fumetti. The nudie-cutie formula reflected the same priorities, concerned mainly with maneuvering female flesh into the most pleasing arrangements their makers could devise. - Even Francis Ford Coppola, while he was still in school at UCLA, made one call "Tonight for Sure." Now, that was actually his first movie. - [Narrator] On the West Coast, the commercial impact of Meyer and his rapidly expanding host of imitators was drawing others into the fold, among them was one Harry H. Novak who, like Friedman, was a product of the studio system. Novak had worked for RKO under Howard Hughes, whose distinguishing characteristics as a mogul had been as censorship battles over Jane Russell's cleavage and the casting in legitimate roles of a famous stripper named Lili St. Cyr. When RKO crumbled into dust in the mid 1950s, Novak was temporarily given the custodianship of the studio's franchise on Walt Disney product. He used his sizeable sales commissions for a purpose Hughes would have loved, but which Disney must've frowned upon. - [Harry] I made a lot of money doing that, and that helped me so that I was able to have money to make my first picture. - [Narrator] Novak's first release was "Girls Without Rooms," a revamped Swedish prostitution expose originally entitled "The Flame." - Kiss me quick. - [Narrator] In partnership with a brilliant sexploiteer named Pete Perry, Novak knocked one into the nudie-cutie bleachers with one of his earliest attempts at production, a campy pastiche of horror, science fiction, and toplessness entitled "Kiss Me Quick," made in 1965. - "Kiss Me Quick" is a comedy. It had all the basic elements. It had Frankenstein, it had spacemen, and it had the TNA in it; put it all together, and you have a big picture all rolled up into one. - [Narrator] Like "Nude on the Moon, "Kiss Me Quick" stood out from other sexploitation titles of its era by echoing aspects of mainstream exploitation filmmaking, only this time with tongue firmly and intentionally planted in cheek. At moments, it's possible to imagine the makers of the durable "Rocky Horror Picture Show" using "Kiss Me Quick" as a primary point of reference. - To study them. - Study them? Do you mean to tell them you have no women on the planet Butlers. - No. - And we got to try to beat the Russians to outer space. - It did exceptionally very big for me in the marketplace. It was my first major production, and it bought me everything I have today. So it was my lucky piece. It's still earning to this day, very well. - [Narrator] "Kiss Me Quick's" returns launched Novak into one of the most sustained careers in independent film distribution of any sexploiteer. By the 1970s, Novak would release over 200 mostly adults only titles into the marketplace. - Every film I put my hands on, I exploited it to the best of my ability, and I gave it a lot of ballyhoo and cornball, and it worked. - [Narrator] Ironically, one of the first casualties of the nudist camp and nudie-cutie revolution was the burlesque circuit the films drew on for inspiration. - They'd order for burlesque houses. You sent him a can of film. He'd put it on a screen 40 foot wide, 20 feet high. It didn't ask for any overtime if he ran it 13 times or 20 times that week. It was always on time. It did everything he told it to do, and no backtalk. So he said, "Who needs burlesque? Just send us film." - The burlesque houses started to go out and "The Wonderful World of Girls" started to come in. - [Narrator] Back in Chicago, Friedman and Lewis were in the process of immortalizing a historical moment with the first of what for Friedman would become a string of movies reflecting his love of the exploitation game itself. In self satirizing "Boin-n-g," two nebbishy amateurs decide to break into the nudie business. - [Both] You're hired! - [Narrator] Their inspiration, the mediocrity of every single sexploitation film Lewis and Friedman collaborated on up to that time. - A great picture! One of the worst I've ever seen! - Yeah, sensational. I don't know when I've seen such lousy acting or more phony scenery. - [Narrator] "Boin-n-g's" behind the scene sequences were straight keystone comedy, seasoned liberally with the requisite pauses for lingering closeups of naked flesh, and presented with a satiric emphasis on our hapless heroes' inability to do anything involved with movie-making correctly. (platform crashes) As filmmakers who had learned by doing, Lewis and Friedman were celebrating their own apprenticeship and that of every single novice writer, director, or producer who'd joined them in this new frontier of independent endeavor. - All right, buster. Cut! - [Narrator] The kicker was a send-up of the entire nudie genre in the person of a cartoon sexploitation mogul reacting to a private screening of the film within the film. - You couldn't stand it, huh? Well, it was just bad enough, boys! I'll take it. - You'll what? - I'll take it. It was the worst picture I ever seen. It'll be a smash at the box office. - [Narrator] It's been said that self satire is the first sign of the end of the genre. After "Boin-n-g" and two last nudist camp efforts, the restless team of Friedman and Lewis were ready to move on to other things. - We had been making nudist camp pictures and nudie-cuties, and it was boring. (playful music) And Herschell said one day, "What can we do that nobody else has done, and that we don't have to have them taking off all their clothes and running around playing volleyball or thinking of gags?" So we started putting down a list of things. Finally, Herschell said, "Could you think of one idea where torture could become a legitimate subject?" and I said, "Yeah. Nazi death camp," he said, "Okay." From that, suddenly, one word hit us, gore. (suspenseful music) - [Narrator] As it turned out, the Hagenbeck and Wallace of movie-making were about to take both the straight exploitation genre and the sexploitation film on a very wild ride. (group screaming) - Well, you listen, and you listen well! You're damaged merchandise and this is a fire sale. And you walk out of here and your reputation won't be worth 15 cents. You do as I tell you! Do you hear? You do as I tell you! - [Narrator] As the mid 1960s approached, strange days came to America. (siren wailing) (dogs barking) - [Announcer] It appears as though something has happened in the motorcade group. - Jack Kennedy, the decade's symbol of youthful optimism, was assassinated before hundreds of witnesses in Dealey Plaza. Less than 48 hours later, his presumed killer was gunned down on live TV. - I have not been charged with that. In fact, nobody has said that to me yet. The first thing I heard about it was when the newspaper reporters in the hall asked me that question. - [Narrator] A world away in Vietnam, an undeclared war was in the early stages of claiming over 50,000 American and upwards of 1 million Vietnamese lives. (gun fires) (siren wailing) Increasingly, American streets rang with protest and ran was American blood. - [Woman] Is there a doctor in the house? I wanna see him right here. - [Man] Everybody else, please stay back! Please stay back! Everybody else, just please stay back! (sorrowful music) - Now, oh, Ishtar, the feast has begun. (dramatic music) - Tony! - [Narrator] As times changed, the opportunists of exploitation changed along with them. - Nobody had ever made a picture that showed blood. Nobody had ever died with their eyes open. - [Narrator] In the most notorious Lewis and Friedman collaboration, there was no nakedness and no sex; in their place, 1963's "Blood Feast" substituted graphic violence so extreme that a lab technician is said to him vomited while processing the dailies. The storyline was ludicrous, penny dreadful stuff. A crazed Egyptian caterer murderously assembles the menu for a cannibalistic dinner party. Reviewers were outraged as were some exhibitors. Friedman's sometime competitor, Harry Novak was moonlighting for a company that handled "Blood Feast" in 1964. - The civic drive-ins did not want to release the picture in its original form. The picture had to be cut, cut, and more cuts. And it was all cut up, mumble jumble. Right up to hours before playtime, that picture had to be cut. - [Narrator] For Friedman and Lewis, extreme violence was just another area of audience fascination the studios were afraid to explore. "Blood Feast" wasn't to be taken seriously, it was all in good fun. - The biggest thing was, was to keep these crazy girls from laughing. While we've got them pinned up and we're peeling the skin off of them, or cutting their hearts out, they're giggling. (woman screams) - [Narrator] But "Blood Feast" and the two Lewis and Friedman gore films that followed it opened up a Pandora's box by becoming among the most influential exploitation films ever made. By decade's end, next generation directors like George Romero were creating graphic depictions of murder and cannibalism, and midnight favorites like "Night of the Living Dead." Meanwhile, beginning in 1967, mainstream fair, like "Bonnie and Clyde" and "The Wild Bunch," brought realistic carnage onto the studio backlots. - The same people that went to see "Blood Feast" went to see "Bonnie and Clyde" and went to see "The Wild Bunch." Again, is it art imitating life or life imitating art? Most of the innovations when it came to changes, particularly when it came, for better or for worse, in so far as frankness and some form of sex and/or violence, started with the independents, and the majors jumped in on the bandwagon afterwards. (bird squawking) - [Narrator] Like a vampire in an AIP horror movie, once a certain segment of the audience got the taste of blood in its mouth, it became insatiable. (dramatic music) Some observers have been shaking their heads ever since. I wonder if you can tell me anything about your opinion of the films of Herschell Gordon Lewis. - I'd really rather not. (laughs) I don't care for such god-awful gory things. (laughs) - Yeah, it's our stupid little $24,000 movie that was made in five days and brought back something like $6 million and is still being seen all over the world on video. But Herschell Lewis put it all in one very succinct sentence. "It's like a Walt Whitman poem. It's no good but it's the first of its kind, therefore it deserves some consideration." - You act like little Miss Muffet and down inside you're dirty. Do you hear me? Dirty! - [Narrator] The sexploitation film was turning toward dark subjects as well, and Friedman and Lewis had already anticipated the trend. 1962's "Scum of the Earth" was a tabloid style expos a of two-bit smut peddlers, combining sexual subjects and gratuitous violence with the production values of an underground stag movie. (jazz music) As in "Boin-n-g," any self-parody was purely intentional. - Okay, Sandy, come on, let's shoot something interesting, you know, the stuff that sells. - All right. But remember, I'm not double jointed. The high school kids who buy these pictures think you are. - [Narrator] By September of 1964, Lewis and Friedman had dissolved their partnership. Friedman hooked up with Dan Sonney, a producer with roots that stretched all the way back to the roadshow era, and returned to Los Angeles where a bonafide sexploitation industry was taking shape. - In the meanwhile, this whole nudie business was burgeoning here. It was like a fraternity or a lodge. We had no secrets among each other. I mean, we've pooled our information for the common good. - So baby wants to play the scene rough. Alright. That's okay. 'Cause Carl, he likes to rough house, himself. - [Woman] Oh, no, no! - [Narrator] Friedman's first post Lewis production became a prototype for a controversial new genre, the roughy. In "The Defilers," directed by Lee frost, two jaded beatniks kidnap a randomly selected young woman and then physically and sexually assault her over a period of several days. - Look at her. If I don't feed her, she goes hungry. (jazz music) She belongs to me like a slave. - [Narrator] Dark, downbeat, almost masochistically bleak, roughies trafficked in behaviors that would have been unthinkable a few years earlier. According to the filmmakers themselves, sexploitation's sudden fascination with human perversity was commercially motivated, and nothing more. - The nudist films were gone, they were no longer ventures, they were no longer commercial, and it's understandable. How much nudity can you see? It becomes boring after a while. So you want a real story. People wanted more for their money, so you gave them a regular feature film. So I sat down and wrote "Sex Peris of Paulette," and so on, and so on, and so on. - As I say, it was just an attempt to get away from what you were doing. The shear on weight of making nudist camp pictures and nudie-cuties was horrendous. - [Narrator] The roughies seemed like a startling departure from the coy comedies that preceded them. (dramatic music) But even the nudist camp pictures and nudie-cuties had been films about frustration. Out of a fear of prosecution, the filmmakers kept any object of male desire just out of reach. In the roughies, this latent sexual frustration erupted to the surface in an orgy of brutality unlike anything adult movies had seen. What the brooding films of Orson Welles, Fritz Lang and Alfred Hitchcock were to the MGM musicals of a previous era, roughies were to the nudie-cuties, the monster in the closet, the shadows cast by all that artificial light. (ominous music) (women screaming) As always in the adults only field, the looming threat of censorship also played its part. - It was not possible to show explicit sexual situations. I'm not saying it wasn't possible to show explicit sex. Nobody even dreamed of that in 1964 outside of people who were selling eight millimeter stag loops out of the trunk of a car. That's why the roughie, in my estimation, substituted violence all the time. At least it was some kind of physical action, an action of the body; an eruptive, climactic activity that you could have in the film. - You be my mama. - [Narrator] Censorship worries and market realities may explain the motives of the filmmakers, but what about the motives of the audience? What drew thousands of outwardly respectable men to back alley theaters and drive-ins for a whole category of movies that wallowed in degradation. (man screaming) A look at wider social trends offers a clue. In 1948 and 1953, an academic named Alfred Charles Kinsey had published two heavily researched reports demonstrating a wide disparity between American sexual practice and social preachment. According to Kinsey's first volume, 70% of pre-war American men had indulged in premarital intercourse, and 50% in post-marital adultery. Over half had frequented prostitutes. One-third had engaged in a homosexual sex act. In Kinsey part two, over 30% of American women were shown to have experienced sex outside the confines of marriage. The "Kinsey Report," as the two volumes came to be known, were unexpected best-sellers. Spawning hundreds of imitators, books of increasingly dubious scientific value were sold as more personal than Kinsey or newer than Kinsey and more daring. The cumulative impact was staggering. A country that fetishized chastity and monogamy stood revealed this practicing little of either. - As you say, it's all in the interest of science. But I've never seen a weirdo in action before, and I might learn something that's not in my Kinsey books. - [Narrator] As the idea of a sexual revolution took hold, sexploiteers, who were used to staying ahead of the curve, were hard pressed to keep up with current events. Perhaps the harrowing world of the roughies reflected the anxieties of a generation of men newfangled enough to be titillated by the carnal possibilities of a broadening sexual revolution, but old fashioned enough to expect blood, thunder, and punishment as the wages of erotic sin. - Do you feel you deserve the punishment? - [Narrator] Or then again, maybe not. - I don't like to destroy anybody's series; but, believe it or not, we weren't paying too much attention back then. We were just making movies. We weren't plotting out any great psychological warfare there. In these theaters, when that customer came out of the joint, believe it or not, he told the manager what he liked about our picture. So you had a pretty good feedback, believe it or not, from these characters that went in to see these picture. - [Interviewer] So in a way, the market is one of the makers of the film, right? - Mm-hmm. - [Narrator] Friedman's "The Defilers" became an influential hit, and other producers took notice. At Box Office International, the roughies' quick turnaround and minimal production values meshed perfectly with Harry Novak's commitment to keeping costs low and distribution volume high. - Do it. Do it. Hurt me. Dirty me. - What? - Just do it. - [Narrator] Novak's emerging marketing philosophy could have come straight from the pages of Kinsey. - Everybody wants to know whose wife is doing what with whom. You give it that sort of secret element to it. Like "Free Love Confidential, "Motel Confidential," It gives the connotation that something is going on behind the doors, under the sheets. People wanna see what took place, and that's what brings them in. - Now that you've bought me, what do you want me to do? - Could we, uh- - [Narrator] Perhaps Novak's finest effort along these lines was "The Agony of Love," a seamy psychodrama about an affluent housewife, played by Pat Barrington, who rebels against the gilded boredom of her marriage by leading a double life as a prostitute. (jazzy music) The squalid premise was redeemed by talented writer/director, William Rotsler's unwavering sympathy for the stifling predicament of a middle-class wife. - I don't know what a genius is, but I think Bill Rotsler might've been a genius, and in a lot of fields. He was a sculptor. He was a cartoonist, he wrote a lot of science fiction. He directed twenty-five motion pictures. And I think all but two of the pictures that he directed, he also wrote. He had an active mind. - [Narrator] "Agony" was as close to a stylistic and thematic tour de force as a feature shot in five days is ever likely to come. Students of the genre have noted the almost scene by scene resemblance of "Agony of Love" to surrealist director Luis Bunuel's "Belle de Jour," which Rotsler's scenario matches right down to its eerie dream sequences. (man laughing ominously) Exploitation was never above ripping off the masters, but if plagiarism occurred in this case, it was on Bunuel's part. Rotsler and Novak's agony was released in 1966, a full year before Bunuel's more renowned work. As the only major female figure in a field dominated by men, Doris Wishman might have been expected to recoil from a genre predicated on violence against women. In fact, many of her most noteworthy and personal films were roughies. - Doris's mid to late '60s films reflected a shift that's difficult to explain. She's not necessarily the first person to have pioneered the look of the roughy, but jumped into it pretty quickly. (suspenseful music) (woman panting) And it obviously spoke to something that she felt deeply and personally in her own experience as a woman, I would say. - [Interviewer] Do you think that people, when they watch your films, can tell that they're made by a woman? - Oh, I don't think so, do you? How can you tell? - A film like "Bad Girls Go to Hell" is very interesting from the point of view of female sexuality also because of the young woman, the star of the film, she encounters a landscape of terrifying sexual perversities, deformities, overwhelming desires; a "lesbian." (dramatic music) - Why are you leaving? You know that I love you. - I know. I love you too. - A loner masochist who beats her, who I think in the code of the 1960s might be considered a repressed homosexual. - Cut it! (pottery smashes) - Also then, a married man who rapes her. (woman gasps) (thrilling music) All these things happen as part of a dream after her husband basically has denied her erotic satisfaction. - Hold me close. - Now, what's wrong? - Uh, I h... I had the most horrible dream. - Shh. - And, again, we see Doris making a very similar comment in these roughies on the catch 22 that women find themselves in, in the mid to late sixties or before feminism. They are asked to be erotic beings by this bachelor swinger culture, but at the same time must be able to immediately convert themselves back into virgins and acceptable spouses, and things like that. - I just felt that this was it, this was what I had to do, and it was gonna be great. (thunder cracking) (woman screams) - [Narrator] The adult filmmakers weren't the only exploiteers who found the chaos of the mid to late 1960s fertile ground for growth and experimentation. From the start of the decade, the prolific Roger Corman was hitting his creative stride. As the AIP Poe films continued to rack up impressive grosses, their director was living a double and, in some ways, a triple life. By the late 1950s, Corman and his brother Gene had founded Film Group, an independent production and distribution outlet designed to both supply product to and compete against AIP. (waves crashing) To fill Film Group's production pipeline, Corman began scouting for young and often untried talent. In no time at all, his track record was little short of amazing. - You think I'm mad, don't you? - Right now, Baron, I'm not sure just what I think. - Roger realized very early on that scripts and actors were for free. It didn't matter, you could pay $1,000 for a script or you could pay $1 million for a script, you got the same script. Your actors were the same thing. It doesn't matter. You don't have to buy cheap actors who couldn't act, you'd buy expensive actors and get them cheap. - Corman Was virtually a one man film school operation, giving people a break in exchange for paying them almost nothing. It gives you credit and some visibility, and you can use that to make more films. - The waste-not-want-not production philosophy at Film Group took low budget cost consciousness to unprecedented levels. (scary music) 1963's "The Terror" is a noteworthy case in point. Co-directed by Corman and a young Film Group employee named Francis Coppola, among others, "The Terror" starred an unknown named Jack Nicholson opposite horror great, Boris Karloff, with "Bucket of Blood Star," Dick Miller, in a prominent supporting role. The entire project was conceived over a rainy weekend to exploit Corman's access to the Gothic sets for "The Raven" a Poe film Corman had just directed for AIP. - See, what Roger would do was he would use all of our stuff; and then when he was done with our picture, he would make another one for himself, see. Using the same sets, we finally would get him to change them a little so they wouldn't look completely identical, see. And then generally speaking, he would bring it to us for distribution. (dramatic music) - Where's the baron? - We must get to him. He's locked himself in the crypt. - And we shot three days of non-sequitur scenes that had no meaning, just a lot of great lines by Boris Karloff that made no sense. - What you see, new tenant, are the remains of a noble house. - See, even he didn't understand what he was saying. - [Narrator] They're not up to the standards of Corman's best Poe films, "The Terror" is a fascinating artifact in that so many talents of tomorrow converged on it. - One by one, just about everybody I knew directed portions of this picture, until the last day of shooting Jack Nicholson said, "Roger, every idiot in town has directed part of this picture, let me direct the last day," and I said, "Sure, Jack, you're the director of the last day of shooting." - [Narrator] "The Terror" was released through AIP in 1963. But even then, the film's unique history wasn't quite complete. - You're safe now. It's over. - [Narrator] When journalist and aspiring filmmaker, Peter Bogdanovich came to work for Corman a few years later, a precondition of Bogdanovich's directorial debut was that he devise a way to incorporate 20 minutes of pre-existing "Terror" footage into "Targets," his striking first feature. - And I couldn't see taking 20 minutes of Karloff footage out of it. I couldn't find 20 minutes to take out of it that I would know what to do with. - And Peter has solved the problem, I think, brilliantly. He had Boris play an actor in 20th century Hollywood, who was making a historical horror film. And the present day stuff was the new footage that Peter shot for "Targets." - Bogdanovich's "Targets" was deemed so good the Corman sold it to Paramount Pictures, an establishment studio which gave the film a limited 1968 release. In 1971, Bogdanovich would make the last picture show for Columbia and emerge as the hottest director in Hollywood, a summit he would be joined on by fellow Corman alumnus, Francis Coppola, who directed Paramount's "The Godfather" in 1972. Bogdanovich and Coppola were the leading edge of a hip, young invasion force that would transform the studio system, a surprising number of which cut their teeth with Corman or at AIP. - I think Roger Corman was one of the most important figures of the modern age, I mean, the modern screen. If you subtract, from modern American cinema, all those people that Roger brought into the movies, you're gonna be very impoverished, because it's Coppola, and Scorsese, and Jonathan Demme, and Paul Bartel. You turn around and somebody else was started by Corman. - [Narrator] The very fact that various exploitation proteges were able to move from independent filmmaking into the Hollywood mainstream demonstrated how tastes were changing. At AIP, Corman both catered to and commented on the emerging youth culture with "The wild Angels," a nihilistic look at an outlaw biker gang, and "The Trip," one of the first exploitation films to deal with a powerful new recreational hallucinogen called LSD. (mellow rock music) - Both subjects were highly controversial. I couldn't very well come out saying "The Trip" in favor of "Dope," yet at the same time I was smoking a little marijuana, as well as most of my friends. So I felt the way to do that, and "The Wild Angels" as well, was to tell as honestly and as objectively as we could what the scene was like, and leave the judgment to the audience. - [Narrator] Both films were almost unbelievably successful by the standards of the day. AIP found itself awash and profits and controversy. - You can't really overestimate the effect that the '60s had; and that is why when they older people would see some of our pictures, they were horrified, as though we had started this, which is nonsense. We didn't start anything. We may have helped them along, we may have given it a voice, but we didn't start anything, it was there, it was burning inside young people. - [Narrator] Other exploiteers quickly staked their claim to the new terrain AIP had opened up. Dave Friedman brought the world "The Acid Eaters," memorable for its vaudeville surrealism and depiction of a 50 foot high pyramid of LSD. (mellow rock music) Producer Harry Novak financed an omnibus documentary of the era's fads and fashions called "Mondo Mod." (discordant rock music) Meanwhile, the studios were becoming increasingly desperate to connect with audiences the exploiteers had been speaking to for a long, long time. - The studios realized that there was such a sea change that they didn't have to answer to religious organizations. So you have a several year period before the NPAA sets up its rating system where anything went, and anything did. - [Narrator] In October of 1968, the motion Picture Production Code, which had been teetering under the burden of defending itself against new types of content collapsed completely, to be replaced by a voluntary rating system. It was a major victory for free speech and filmmaking, one various exploiteers had been fighting for for decades. Ironically, the creation of the rating system also marked the beginning of exploitation's ultimate decline. - Hollywood was opening up to profanity, and nudity, and extreme violence, and things like that, so the major studio films became more and more explicit, and they took over the subject matter. - [Narrator] By 1969, exploitation proteges we're reinventing studio filmmaking with movies like the Dennis Hopper, Peter Fonda biker epic, "Easy Rider," a direct descendant of Corman's "Wild Angels" and "The Trip," and a film which was originally developed by Hopper and Fonda for Corman to produce at AIP. Meanwhile, a new rating that was created to stigmatize adults only fair was being flaunted in ads like a badge of honor. Sexploiteers trumpeted important court victories without necessarily recognizing that the rules were changing for everyone. In 1969, an X-rated studio feature called "Midnight Cowboy" became a critical and commercial favorite for its daring and supposedly groundbreaking treatment of raw sex, homosexual themes, and prostitution, subjects exploiteers like Friedman, Wishman and Novak had been trafficking in for years. - My pictures set the groundwork for many of the major studios to come in with stories similar to ours, 'cause we were making money while they were dropping dead at the box office. - [Narrator] With the release of "Easy Rider" and the triumph of the X-rated "Midnight Cowboy" at the 1969 Academy Awards, both the youth exploitation film and the adults only movie had moved into the commercial mainstream. The process would take over two decades to complete, but the exploiteers' very success in shattering the old taboos had doomed them to eventual extinction. For the instinctive outsiders of exploitation, they would increasingly no longer be an outside. - [Man] Here we go. (board crashing) - [Narrator] So what, in the final analysis, did the exploiteers achieve? The individual statistics give some idea of the scale of their accomplishment. - If we did anything, it was that we opened a way for the independents. - [Narrator] AIP launched dozens of major film careers and distributed approximately 500 titles during the 27 years between 1954 and 1980. - What happened all the pens? - [Narrator] As this documentary neared completion, Sam Arkoff was still an active Hollywood producer at the age of 81. - There were no road signs specifically pointing the way, but the roads themselves were there. - [Narrator] Roger Corman founded two post film group production companies, New World Pictures and Concord New Horizons, whose California soundstages are shown here. Corman's resume includes the production and/or distribution of over 300 film titles, over 50 of which Roger Corman directed himself. - I have a high school education in how pictures are made, but I got a PhD in how pictures are sold. - [Narrator] Between 1960 and 1985, Dave Friedman was involved with the creation of over 50 theatrical features, most of which he produced, many of which he also scripted. Currently, Freedman owns and operates a traveling carnival. - All the pictures I've made her like my children. I love them all. They all play their own part in my life. - [Narrator] Harry Novak was still actively distributing his enormous library of over 200 exploitation titles at the time of this documentary's production. - You say to me that I made exploitation films and I say to you that every film was an exploitation film; because as soon as you advertise something, you're exploiting it. Do you agree? - [Narrator] Doris Wishman has produced, written, and/or directed some 25 films, making her the most prolific female director of the American sound era. (man laughing laughing ominously) - Faster, Sally, faster! - [Narrator] As for the rest of us, we live in a world the exploiteers made for us, one rife with outcast images which moved in from the margins and took over the commercial mainstream. (woman screaming) - Faster, sally, faster! (man laughing frantically) - [Narrator] The question that's still debated is this: Are we collectively better off for the new realms of content exploitation opened up, or did the exploiteers' ultimate victory represent the triumph of the sordid and lurid over some imagined era of civility and taste? The shocking facts have all been laid before you, some of them frightening, many of them less than refined, so you decide. - [Interviewer] You said before, there would always be independent films, will there always be exploitation films? - What the devil do we have but exploitation films? All you have to do is look at those big pictures every week. They go out, they are covered with advertising, with TV commercials, with everything, for God's sakes. And this year we've seen, and in many cases, the first week is their best week, and then they tail off and the next one comes along. What do you think that's sold then? It's the exploitation that's sold. It's not the picture that's sold, it's the exploitation. And that's basically why we have our exploitation pictures, even though our arty-farties and pseudo intellectuals refuse to admit it, you see? And interesting thing about all arty-farties is they want all the accolades and they want all the wealth, but they really wanna be able to sneer at their lesser men, the audience in the theaters. We never sneered at them, we recognize that was our blood.
