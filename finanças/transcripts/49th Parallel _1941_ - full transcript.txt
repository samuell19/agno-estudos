I see a long, straight line athwart a continent. No chain of ports or deep flowing river or mountain range, but a line drawn by men upon a map nearly a century ago, accepted with a handshake and kept ever since. A boundary which divides two nations, yet marks their friendly meeting ground. The 49th Parallel. The only undefended frontier in the world. Crew, get to your stations! Fine work, Hirth. Magnificent, Herr Kommandant. So the curtain rises on Canada. Stand by! Stand by! Radio message from the Anticostilite. Reports attack by a German submarine, latitude 40 degrees 15 minutes north, longitude 58 degrees 25 minutes west. Reports sinking rapidly and only one boat seaworthy. Latitude 40 degrees 15 minutes north. Longitude 58 degrees 25 minutes west. Warn all coastal batteries in the area to be on 24-hour watch until further notice. All destroyer flotillas and anti-submarine units at Sydney and Canso, operate Plan Z. Turn every available patrol plane to locating the raider... to locating the raider. Stop motors! Find the captain. Question him. Kuhnecke! - Yes, Herr Kommandant? - What are you doing? Where's your camera? You there! Come alongside! Man the gun. Yes, you'll make it. Come along, all together. Stop! Where's your captain? The old man's dead. He went to the cabin to get the ship's papers. He must have got caught when she rolled. Your first officer? - Jackie's dead too, isn't he? - Yes. - Your second officer? - Here. Come on deck. - Your ship? - The Anticostilite. - Your destination? - Montreal. - Your cargo? - Crude oil. How many tons? 3,000. That's a lie. You were carrying a full cargo. 2,000 tons of crude oil and 5,000 tons of gasoline. Is that correct? If you say so. Action stations! Prepare to dive! You dirty swine! Full speed ahead. - Flood five. - Flood five. - Depth: Thirty metres. - Thirty. Five, ten, twenty... - Here come the boys! - Give them a cheer! Hooray! Hooray! Only a fool would imagine we could raid enemy ships for supplies now. Outgoing ships will be detained, incoming ships heavily convoyed, at least for the next few days. We must find a spot where the enemy is least likely to seek us out, which is not being patrolled every day, where they'll never think of finding us. Hudson Bay. Too many damned icebergs about. What's our position? Three miles off Point Amour. If we go up, we risk the patrols, but we'd make better time. If we stay below, we risk the ship. I'm going up. Action stations! Where are we? The North Pole? Belle Isle Straits. There's a lot of ice coming down. 50 degrees. 50 degrees, Herr Leutnant. Good. I can see the opening dead ahead. Take a look, Hirth. You're quite sure? This is a suitable indraught? Yes, Herr Kommandant. Those are the cliffs he mentions in his notes. Stand by! Message received via Resolution Island from Hudson Bay post at Fort Furlot. Eskimo hunter reports two days ago seeing object proceeding west through Hudson Straits. Maybe German submarine U-37. Warn Royal Canadian Air Force bases at Churchill and Wakeham Bay to send out patrols. - 95 degrees. - 95 degrees, Herr Kommandant. According to Malotte, there should be a shelving beach at the end of the fjord. Will you go in? Yes. Then you can pick a landing party. Clean ship. I'll give you 12 hours. Canada. Leutnant Hirth, you have your orders. Leutnant Kuhnecke, you are second-in-command. You are taking one day's rations with you, not more. Your mission is to bring back food and fuel. Over that hill, you will find a Hudson's Bay trading post. If the men there are armed, and are foolish enough to offer resistance, you will destroy them. Jahner! Take this flag. As soon as the post is captured, you will hoist it. And I shall bring the ship in. Do not forget. You are the first of the German forces to set foot on Canadian soil, the first of many thousands. Be worthy of that high honour. Acquit yourselves like men and Germans. Each of you in the fulfillment of his duty is helping to bring about the completion of our Führer's great plan. Today, Europe. Tomorrow, the whole world. Heil Hitler! At ease. Follow me. Submarine ahead, off Wolstenholme. Calling number two and three. Calling number two and three. Peter calling. Peter calling. Just spotted submarine. Going to have a look-see. Maybe a Jerry, boys. Enemy attacking! Action stations! It's her, all right. U-37. It's the Jerry, boys. Carry out attack, number two leading. And, Dickie, make it hot. OK, kid! Down! Get below! Prepare to dive! And now let Papa try. We're hit! Five... Six... Seven... Eight... Swine! Filthy swine! Devils... Jahner! Looks like a trapper's just got in. - Hello, Johnnie! - What's going on here? Who are you? This one, boss, and this one. Just come in, Johnnie. Somebody's fond of potatoes round here. Hey, there's a year's supply in that pot. This one, boss, he no eat potatoes. One year, Johnnie. Stop calling me Johnnie! Hey, my hot water. Who's been using my hot water? This one, boss, very dirty boy. He no take bath for one whole year. I know that voice. Albert! Comment ça va, mon vieux? You old walrus. By golly, it's dandy to see you! - When did you get in? - One half-hour ago. I find the water on the stove and dinner cooking. I say, "Johnnie, you're in luck." Your friend Albert is expect you!" What do you think of my whiskers? She is dandy? - Man, they're grand! - Give me a scissor and your razor quick. Sure. I'm hoping you're going to stay for a while this time. Sure thing! I stay till the boat comes. And wait till you see my skins. The best year I never had. And now, I'm going to get so busy doing nothing. Yes, sir! I'm going to do nothing like she's never been done before. Hello, Winnipeg! Hello, Winnipeg! This is Wolstenholme calling, Wolstenholme calling. This message to be sent on to Three Rivers - Trois Rivières - Quebec. Trapper Johnnie Barras is anxious to send a message to his father, Napoleon Barras, of... Hold on a minute! Wait a minute! Wait a minute! Here you are. Of... 32 Rue Crevisse. And his mother and his eight sisters and six brothers. Tell them that he has arrived safely this evening at Wolstenholme post after a successful 11 months hunting and trapping. He says thanks for sending on last year's mail. And the rosary. And the cake, that kept very well in its airtight tin. And he says send on another one. Go on, Winnipeg. Hudson Bay House, Winnipeg speaking. Nice work, Johnnie! - This is Ed speaking. - Hiya! Good night, Wolstenholme. Good night. Good night, Winnipeg. Good night. Ship time at Kangiqsujuaq. Say, where's the ship? I've been answering that question till I'm sick and tired of it. Everyone who comes here asks it. - Where's the ship, boss? Where's the ship? - Bien. Where is she? Behind the hill. Oui, bien sûr. Come on and sit down. Well, what's the news from home? Some good, some bad. Everyone is well, that is good. Business is slow, that is bad. My father say it is because of them war rumours. But he tell me no worry, this Hitler is only bluffing. And he said they all say there will be no war this year or next year. Qu'as-tu, alors? You look at me as I go mad. Of course, I was forgetting. You can't have seen a paper in over a year. - What do you mean? Has it happened, then? - Sure it's happened. Bigger than the last. Nom de Dieu. - Who fighting? - Mostly everybody. Who starting first? The Germans, of course. They marched in on the Poles in September 1939. The Poles? Ma foi! I thought all the Poles was in Canada. No, no, Johnnie. They've given Poland a terrible time. Wiped out Warsaw. And those poor refugees - the women and children who tried to get away. They machine-gunned them down. Ils exagèrent! The Germans are ordinary men, same as you and me. I wouldn't do a thing like that. Would you? You can't tell me they do. That's all newspaper talk to try and bring us in. You're a wee bit late, Johnnie, my lad. We are in. Canada in the war? Sure. Didn't you hear the bombing tonight? Bombing? Was that bombing? Sure. One of our planes went over. Manoeuvring, I suppose. Aye, aye, aye. So Canada, she in the war. Pas possible. Anyhow, you can't tell me French Canada got mixed in it too? I certainly can. Nom de Dieu! They're in it just the same as everybody else. But that beats me! I don't see what for. French Canada has to go to defend a bunch of Poles? I don't get that at all! I don't see what that mean to us. Anyhow, one kind of government much same like another. You're right there. They're all the same. Don't get you nowhere. But anyhow, we needn't worry about it out here. I guess all we've got to do is just... do our jobs. Yeah, that suit me. - What about a wee drink, Johnnie? - That suit me too. - Well, here's the skin off your nose. - And off yours too, you old walrus! I won't sleep well tonight. Never do, first night in real bed. I was just the same when I was trapping. But you get used to it in a couple of nights. The dogs are noisy tonight. Seem like your and mine getting to know one another. Aye, the wind is blowing up. My, a regular Montreal concert. - Window! Door! - Nom de Dieu, qu'est-ce que c'est? - What's the big idea? - Hello... - Johnnie! - Stay where you are. - Herr Leutnant. - No-one else there? Only this. Search him. Kranz, Lohrmann - the other two. You have ammunition and rifles here. Where? In the cupboard. Kranz. Your rifle. You no smash cupboard. It comes no locked. - Where are the rifles? - Tell him. - In the store. - Which is the store? The big building outside with a company sign. Vogel. Kranz. What sort of crook are you, anyhow? What's the game? Have you people in Canada not heard there's a war on? Yeah, sure, we hear there war on.! Maudit cochon! You... - German. - Yes, German. We are German. OK. Why yell about it? Moi, j'ai compris. You're German. I'm Canadian, he Canadian and he Canadian. My father fight against you last time. We give you one good licking then and we do it again. Johnnie! Don't any of you guys ever laugh? The English tell us we've no sense of humour, which means simply that our humour is different. I tell Nick. He appreciate that. - Nick? - My servant, who your man kicked when he can't kick back. The Eskimos are racially as low as Negroes. What's wrong with Negroes? - They're semi-apes, one degree above Jews. - Who says so? Those are the Führer's own words from Mein Kampf. Voyons! I make my living trapping animal. But if I was meet half-ape, I wouldn't kick him in the stomach as you did that husky in there. Please don't abuse our kindness. We're trying to be friendly. OK, OK, OK. Do you have to waste my batteries? - I want you to answer a few questions. - Let's hear them first. What transport have you to the outside world? Transport! I'll have to walk to the railway or else wait for the boat. When's the next boat? If the weather's good, she'll be here this July. - If the ice closes, the July after that. - I want the truth. - You're calling me a liar? - Yes. You ask me to believe you've one ship a year? Believe it or not, it's all the same to me, my wee man. - Where's the nearest railway? - Churchill. Churchill! Nearest police post? You'll soon find out. - Lake Harbour. - You seem to know all about it? - What strength is it? - 30 men. Or is it... 25, Albert? Or two? Tiens, quelle belle carte! Where you get him? Regardez ça, Albert. - How about this map? - It makes ours look out of date. - Where did you get it? - Did you meet a missionary called Malotte? Malotte! Sure! You remember him, Albert? The flying missionary. You remember that time his airplane was lost and all the people prayed for his safety? He was one grand fellow. And an even better map-maker. So that was it. The spying blackguard! I would never have believed it, a man of his cloth. And good. Good priest like Malotte. And a good German. With a report from the far north. Cape Ross reports heavy ice... A- U-E calling C-Y-7-B. 9- A-U-E calling C-Y-7-B. Come in, C-Y-7-B. C- Y-7-B. That's our call signal. Who is it? Just a friend of mine. An American from Grand Rapids, Michigan. - He plays chess with me. - Chess? - Sure, chess. - Why? To pass the time. Ma foi, he don't often get such pleasant company here! The board's over there on the table by the radio. We play three nights a week. But not tonight. It'll be the first night we've missed in nearly two years. 9- A-U-E calling C-Y-7-B. 9- A-U-E CQing C-Y-7-B. Hope everything's all right. What's the matter, Mac? Why don't you answer? This is Russell. Try again in 15 minutes. If still missing, will report to Winnipeg. If still missing, will report to Winnipeg. Standing by. What is he going to report? An accident might have happened to me. He'll do something about it. - Why Winnipeg? - The head office of our company. - What company? - The Hudson's Bay Company. Hirth. Psst! Tell me, er... do you really march around in Berlin doing this? Yes. Why? - I know what I'm talking about. - You always do, don't you? We're not in the ship. The position's different. You forget I'm a High Party member. One of the first million in 1930. You didn't even join until 1936. One of the first 70 million, that's you. And I'm a practical man, too. I'm not a dreamer, an idealist, like you. It's all a question of experience. I'm an engineer. I understand ships, radio, planes, and I understand human nature. I'm right. They must play chess. It's too dangerous to allow one of these men... With my gun at his head? - That makes no difference. - That American may cause trouble. He'll notify Winnipeg. They'll know about our submarine and put two and two together. I'm right, Hirth. They must play chess. My move. Pawn H2 takes G3. Pawn H2 takes G3. Standing by. - I told you not to make that move. - I know what I'm doing. Watch me. Why should I watch you, may I ask? The game's lost. I haven't lost a game in two years. You haven't lost this one yet, have you? - Are you ready? - Aye, I'm ready. Pawn B7 to B5. Say, why did my wife have to go to a double feature the one night I had you on the run? But you come to the wrong man. I won't guide you to the railroad, me. - You'll never make it, anyhow. - Why not? This is one big country. But very few people. Everyone know everybody. You can't make a goose step through it without the police find out. - But no-one has seen us. - Penses-tu? Écoute. If one husky dog have the smell of you, his boss know from the way he howl that there is stranger in district. One Eskimo might find your track. Maybe have. Most likely that Eskimo is on his way to the Mountie Police right now. Perhaps. Perhaps. So you must help us. After all, it's your own interest. Now that your country has surrendered. My country? Surrender? At 12:30 on 17th June 1940, France laid down her arms. France? I'm Canadian! Yes, you're a French Canadian. But you must know that after the war, the Führer will free your people from British tyranny. Comment? How? French Canada will be free. You will be free. Mais c'est idiotique! Ma foi! I am free! Or I was plenty free till you guys got in. I mean the freedom of your people, an oppressed minority. The freedom to speak their own language, to have their own schools and churches. Here you will find it written in the Führer's own words. Perhaps you've read it? I've no room in my pack for any book. I know my Bible. That's enough for me. This is the Bible. You must get a copy. It will explain everything to you as it has to me. You'd better look up how to get out of Canada, then. Maybe she don't tell you that? Quelle écriture funny. Maybe your Führer ain't so smart as he think. Don't he know that we French Canadians have always our own school? And church. And a right to speak as we want. And run our own affairs, by golly! No doubt you have certain privileges, but I don't... Let me ask you one question. Well? How about them... Poles? How about the French? Do you let them run their own affair? That is different. The whole new order in Europe. OK, OK. You said enough. Hello, hello. Russell speaking. Say, my wife's just got in an extra, and the whole front page is covered with news about that submarine your flyers knocked out. Tell them... Maude, quit yelling in my ear and give me the paper. I want to read it to them. You'll do no such thing. It's my story. Don't be a heel. Mac'll want to hear about it. You take a back seat, honey, and I'll read it. Hello? Hello? Is that you, Mac? This is Maude speaking. It says the submarine was sunk right in your back yard. I'll read it to you. "Nazi U-boat sunk in Hudson Bay." That's the headline. "A German submarine believed to be the U-37 was destroyed in Hudson Bay" near Wolstenholme by Canadian coastal command patrol planes. According to an official report, the squadron leader claimed that several direct hits by medium bombs were scored before the Nazis could submerge. He circled the spot "and found no signs of any survivors." There's a whole lot more to it, but that's the gist. - How come you didn't know? - Why didn't you... Help! Get your rifles! Come out! You can't leave him there like that. You dirty lot of murderers! Vogel, see if they've heard anything outside. Killers, that's all you are. Killers! - All quiet, Herr Leutnant. - Good. They can't have heard the shot. Johnnie... Johnnie. Johnnie, my son. It's nearly one. It'll be three, four hours before there's anybody about. If anybody should come to the post, we'll see they don't get away. Kranz, Lohrmann, get him into the other room. - What about the radio? - Dead. I wonder if that American in Michigan got anything. Idiot! - Well, that should do it, Vogel? - Yes, Herr Leutnant. - If you were to... - Shut up! Can you hear anything, Herr Leutnant? Shut up, can't you? I've got it. Wake them up quickly. - Herr Leutnant! - Jahner! - What is it? - Come on here. Winnipeg. - Hudson's Bay Company. - What are they saying? They're sending a plane. An emergency plane from Churchill. It'll be here in three hours. There's a police boat coming too. - Johnnie. - We've got to get out of here quickly. The company's sending a plane. - Who can handle a plane? - I can. - Can anyone else? - No, Herr Leutnant. - No, Herr Leutnant! - You don't doubt I have the experience? - How many flying hours? - Enough. Well, it'll have to be you. Lohrmann, Vogel. What about our clothes? We can't go like this. You mean our uniforms? Don't be a sentimental fool. We can't escape in these outfits. You're right for once. Men, this is our one chance of escape, our only one. We must be ready for it. We must have new clothes, money, food, rifles, ammunition... - Where do you keep the money? - There is none. - Don't lie. You sell things here. - Not for money. It's exchange, barter. Plenty of coats, Herr Leutnant. Timiyut! Timiyut! What's the trouble at the post? What's happened to the factor? Nothing happened at the post. My son go to white man yesterday. No come back yet. Anybody else at the post? Trapper Johnnie. Stay one day. Aukshinai! Aukshinai! I'm a German officer. I warn you not to resist. Run, Les! Fire! Aim low! Cease-fire! Kranz, stand guard! Kuhnecke and Lohrmann, get the boats ready. Jahner, Vogel - report to me when ready! Hey, you. Give him some water. It's behind me. You're a Christian, aren't you? No, I'm not. What's he trying to say? He wants his rosary. What's the good of that to him? When... When... we win... the war... we... send you... some... missionaries. All ready, Herr Leutnant. Thanks, laddie. Contact! I can't take off. We're overloaded. Throw something out. Lohrmann. That'll do. Still no use. Everything will have to go. - Everything! - Throw out the rifles! - How low is the gas? - It's all right. Are you sure we have enough? Our maximum speed seems to be about 145km/h... - 160. - Herr Leutnant. Malotte has a note here. Can't risk it. - Seems a shorter course. - Yes, but longer over the sea. Some of the magnetic variations up here are as much as 40 degrees. By taking 269 degrees, we can pick up the bush railway down the coast as far as Lake Winnipeg. But we'll need 15 flying hours. Do you hear? I'm not deaf. Have we enough gas or haven't we? Yes. - Are we out of gas? - Can't be! Emergency tank. I had to switch over, that's all. I suppose the emergency tank is full? Of course. When we filled up at Wolstenholme, did you check the emergency tank? Did you check the emergency tank? What difference does it make whether I checked it or not? - Well, did you or didn't you? - Very well, then. No. - You've got us into a mess! - Don't shout at me! I'm trying to take control. We'll make a forced landing... Forced landing! We're 200 kilometres from the border! I can't think of everything, can I? I can't help it if I make a mistake sometimes. You're in command. Why don't you handle it yourself? I wish I could! - We're going to crash. What shall we do? - Nothing. Hang on! - There's a lake ahead! - All right, I'm not blind! Parachute! We'll never make it. Can you lift her a little? Leave me alone, can't you? - Any orders? - No. Save yourselves if you can. - Jump for it, Kranz. - Get down! Get down! Hold on tight, everybody! I'm going to try something! That's better. Better. - Throw something out! - What? A cushion, anything. I can't see the surface. - There isn't time! - I can't see! I can't see to land! Out! Out! I'll get you out, Herr Leutnant! Vogel! Vogel! All right, Herr Leutnant! Herr Leutnant. Herr Leutnant! Herr Leutnant! He's dead. So that's Kuhnecke. Look out! It's a woman. German. - German? - The girl has a German newspaper. Germans here? Why not? There are half a million of us in Canada. Vogel, go and speak to her. See what you can find out. Don't try to be too clever. Keep as near to the truth as you can. - Hello. - Hello. That's a good-looking scarecrow. Why, you're only a kid. I thought you were much older in that get-up. I'm 16. Are you looking for work? Yes. How did you know? You don't look like a hobo. - Reaping started? - Just begun. Are you on your own? Those. Those are my pals. It's all right. - I thought they were your pals. - Why? Seasonal workers always travel in gangs. Well, these are my pals. - This is... - Anna. Anna. She's 16. It isn't true. I shouldn't lie. I shall be 16 the day after tomorrow. It's only a difference of two days. Yes, but Peter says there's no difference at all between a small lie and a big lie. - Who is Peter? - Our leader. So you have a leader? Yes, a wonderful leader. You will meet him. Aren't you coming to the settlement? - There isn't another for eight miles. - We're looking for work. We should be glad to, but er... there are four of us. Don't worry. When 111 people sit down for supper, four more won't make any difference. - Did you say 111? - 39 brothers, 47 sisters and 25 children. What are you? Mormons? Mormons? No, Hutterites. I didn't mean we were all one family. We're only brothers and sisters in God. Hurry up. Anna! More bread for our guests! We're sorry about the bread. I know a bit about baking. If you don't mind my saying so, you ought to get a new baker. We had a good one but he went to Small Springs. - Better pay? - Pay? No-one gets paid here. Doesn't anyone get paid anything? - No. - What do you work for, then? - Just your keep? - No, for us all. - All these people work for nothing? - Yes. - What sort of work? - Whatever suits them best. Well, what do you mean? They don't choose themselves, do they? Haven't you got a leader? Yes. There he is, over there. Where? Which is your leader? There. First on the right. Well, doesn't he tell the people what sort of job they've got to do? We tell him what we want to do. Then how can he be your leader? How do you mean? Well, anyone works in whatever job they like, then? Yes, that's right. If somebody can make shoes, he makes shoes. If he wants to be a blacksmith, he works in the forge. If somebody feels he can preach, well, he preaches. What's your specialty? I'm... the baker. When you sell your stuff in Winnipeg, what happens to the money? We buy new tractors, build houses, found new settlements. We've just founded a new one over at Small Springs. If someone leaves you and then wants to come back, don't you punish them? - Punish? - Yes, don't you send them to... a camp or something? Camp? Why a camp? No, we just take them back because our religion tells us to. - The Hutterite religion? - The Christian religion. Is it one of your rules to sing like this? We haven't any rules. We sing because we like to. It's good for the digestion. Good night. The leader will look after you. - Thank you. - What's the salute? The what? Don't you give the leader a salute? - Good evening, friends. - Good evening. On behalf of my friends, I have to thank you for giving us food and shelter. You're welcome. I hear you come from up north in the woods, or down north, as we call it here. Yes. - Just come out? - Last week. Are you Germans? I ask, are you Germans? - Yes. - Are you ashamed of it? Of course not. I'll show you where to sleep. Thank you. Most of us are Germans. You may find some from the same part of your country as yourselves. Anna, I thought you would have told them all about us. We mostly discussed birthdays. Well, it's quite an event with us, the 16th birthday. It means that one is grown-up at last. Come in, please. This house belongs to Hugo Waldner, one of our brothers who's gone to the new settlement. - At Small Springs? - Yes. You see, we are like bees. If we get too many, we send out a swarm. So the house is empty and at your service. - Good night. Sleep well. - Good night. That's what I call a busy girl. - It's nothing. I make 14 beds every night. - That's a lot of work. You see, we have a lot of men who have no mothers and who aren't married yet. So somebody has to make their beds. Quite right. Two of you can sleep in here. And there are two more beds in the other room. - Where do you sleep? - In Peter's house. - In Peter's house? - But I don't make his bed. Poor Peter. Why not? Because he has a mother to look after him. Haven't you a mother? No. She was drowned. Drowned? In the sea. When we left Germany, we went to England because we had to wait until we got a permit to come to Canada. - We got our permit after war was declared. - Was your father with you? Wait a minute. I want to hear about her mother. - Her ship was sunk. - Torpedoed? I think so. Don't you know? Was there a big explosion? Shut up, you two. You and your questions. Don't answer the man? Leave that. Run along now. I'll take her home. All right, you take her. - Good night, Anna. - Good night. Chins up. Remember, then, do nothing without orders. Discipline is more important than ever. So far, luck has been with us. It's a great stroke of fortune being here at all. Do you think they' re friendly, Herr Leutnant? Friendly, yes. But you saw how their leader tried to draw us out. "Are you Germans? Are you ashamed of being Germans?" That in a country with which we're at war. There can only be one answer to that. Our agents have done their work well. Yes, this religion may be nothing but a cover. I bet they sing the Horst Wessel song better than hymns. We shall see that tomorrow. Heil Hitler! Heil Hitler! Shut the door. Well, Vogel, who knows? Perhaps one day, the story of our adventures will be written in a book. In a few years' time, it may be the basis of compulsory lectures for the Hitler Youth. The ships we sank with women and children aboard. The lifeboats we shelled. We were good at that. What you did to the Eskimos at the post. The unarmed men we shot in the back. You forget, Vogel, we're at war. We can't expect to win without the methods of total warfare. Men, women and children are all our enemies and must be treated as such. Did you never read Bismarck? "Leave them only their eyes to weep with." Leave them only their eyes to weep with. Did he say that? Those were his actual words in the war of 1870. You should study Bismarck. He was a great German. A great German. You know, Vogel, I'm worried about you. You're a good fellow, but you don't discipline yourself. You give way to emotions. That'll land you in trouble one of these days. Why don't you take an example from Kranz, a fine soldierly fellow? You could be just as good a Nazi as he is, if you tried. Are you listening, Vogel? Yes, Herr Leutnant. - Then think it over. - Yes, Herr Leutnant. And get out of bed and turn out the light. Yes, Herr Leutnant. Vogel, I... - Herr Leutnant? - Either of you seen Vogel? - No, Herr Leutnant. - Get dressed at once. - Good morning, friend. - Morning. He's asking for you. All right. - Well? Aren't you going? - I can't go till I've got this lot ready. What shall I tell him? I'll be along in a minute. Now, where's this new baker I hear about? Now, that's what I call bread. You'll have to teach David the trick. Trick or no trick, I could never make bread as good as that. Cheer up, David. It took me seven years. Why did you want to give it up? I didn't want to give it up. I had to. You see, we all had... Peter! Just come and look at this bread. Good morning, friend. Mr Vogel is the best baker we've had here in 15 years. I can't imagine why his last boss let him go. He must have been crazy. If he wasn't then, he is now. Congratulations, Vogel. It was a good idea. Round the back! What's the news in Winnipeg? The market was good for geese. People are asking for Hutterite geese. I don't like that, Andreas. No? For 300 years, our brethren have wandered from place to place, from country to country, because of the jealousy of others. This is a good country, Andreas. - I met Frau Habermann. - Her trial was on today, wasn't it? Her husband and her eldest son Eric had to be interned. She's free. Bad luck. Just at harvest time. It wasn't a good day for the trial. The papers are full of stories about those Germans who landed from a U-boat down north. They seem to have acted like wild beasts, killing and stealing. - What's Frau Habermann going to do? - I had a talk with her. - She needs help on the farm. - That'll be difficult. We'll talk it over. Tell the others we'll have a meeting tonight, yes? The air's heavy. I'm afraid we are going to have a storm tonight. Sorry. Sorry I'm late, Peter. Barbarina, there's an electric storm playing all around us, frightening the animals and your chickens. Move over, Philip. What about you, Anna? Andreas, one of our guests is speaking. What? Good! We're discussing the Habermanns. I was about to say, you have one clear choice. Where there is a question of blood, where one is governed by the deepest of racial instincts, then every other consideration is swept aside. Men like yourself - German, or of German ancestry - rise up with all the might and power of the great German people behind you, conscious of the sacred duty that binds us all together, in the knowledge that he who does not forget his people will not by his people be forgotten. There is a new wind blowing from the east. A great storm coming across the sea. A hurricane which will sweep aside all the old outmoded ways of life and mark the beginning of a new order, not only for Europe but for the whole world. Let those beware that would have the temerity to stand in its way. They will go down before its irresistible impulse and be quashed out of existence. But for those who accept the new order, for those who perhaps belong to it already, why need I use these parables of speech any longer? I mean all of you here tonight. Yes, you, brothers! I call you brothers and proudly acknowledge you as such. You who form the little stronghold of our people here in Canada. You will have your share of the happiness and prosperity that is waiting for us all. When the storm is over and the sun rises, that mighty sun, which will give us everything we need in life... What sun are you talking about, friend? I am talking of the greatest idea in history. The supremacy of the Nordic race, the German people. I am talking of the being whose name I am certain lives in every heart, whose name hangs on all our lips, whether we can shout it to the world or only whisper it in one another's ears. Germans! Brothers! I ask you to join with me in paying homage to our glorious Führer. Heil Hitler! I don't ask where you come from or what brought you here, although you've left us in no doubt as to your beliefs. Someone has given you, no doubt deliberately, a completely false impression of us. We are only one amongst many foreign settlements in Canada. There are thousands of them in this part of the world. And they have been founded - some recently, some 80 years ago - by people who left their homes in Europe because of famine, because of starvation, because of racial and political persecution, and some, like ourselves, because of their faith. Some came only to find new land, new boundaries, a new world. But all have found here in Canada the security, peace and tolerance and understanding which, in Europe, it is your Führer's pride to have stamped out. You call us Germans. You call us brothers. Yes. Most of us are Germans. Our names are German, our tongue is German. Our old handwritten books are in German scripts. But we are not... your brothers. Our Germany is dead. However hard this may be for some of us older people, it's a blessing for our children. Our children grew up against new backgrounds, new horizons. And they are free! Free to grow up as children. Free to run and to laugh, without being forced into uniforms, without being forced to march up and down the streets, singing battle songs. You talk about a new order in Europe. The new order, where there will not be one corner, not a hole big enough for a mouse, where a decent man can breathe freely. You think we hate you. But we don't. It is against our faith to hate. We only hate the power of evil which is spreading over the world. You and your Hitlerism... are like the microbes of some filthy disease, filled with a longing to multiply yourselves until you destroy everything healthy in the world. No. We are not... your brothers. What do you want? I've come to tell you that you can make your own beds. I don't want to work for you. That's all right, Anna. Run along now. You're Nazis, aren't you? Aren't you? We're not allowed to hate anybody. But I hate you. I believe you've escaped from an internment camp. I should tell the police about you. You killed my father because he said your Führer was the Antichrist. You drowned my mother. I hate you. I hate you! So you're going to tell the police about us, are you? Little girls should be seen and not heard. That'll do. What's the matter with you? - That'll do! - Vogel! Come along, Anna. I'll take you home. Herr Leutnant! We can't let them go. I'd like to see what you're going to do about it. - Vogel! - Yes, Herr Leutnant. - Have you forgotten who you are? - No, Herr Leutnant. Let the girl go and shut the door. I'll take her home, Herr Leutnant. Is that you, Anna? Yes, Peter. I brought Anna home. She's all right. We're going now. Perhaps in a few minutes. I only wanted to say that you've been kind and I like it here. You like my bread and I like the way you live. Being with you has made me feel like it used to be at home. I'd almost forgotten what it was like. Baking bread, doing my real work. That's how it used to be, seven years ago, before everything changed. The life I've been living seems to have no sense in it now. Well, I'd better go now. Please, don't go. - Are they still talking? - Hush, child. Go to sleep. How can a man like you, Vogel...? I mean, you're a simple, good human being. How can you get mixed up with such a lot of... gangsters? What can you do? When you're a boy, you like playing soldiers. When you're a young man, you can't get work unless you belong to them. When you're an old man, you're anxious not to lose what you've got. But there are thousands of men like you, Vogel. Men who don't like the way things are going. I suppose so. I suppose they don't know, themselves. I didn't know. It's as if a blind man said he doesn't know the sun shines. I suppose so. Why don't you stay with us, Vogel? Do you mean it? Of course I mean it. Even if you know who I am, where I come from? I don't care who you are or where you come from. I know you. Thank you, Peter. It will mean internment. What does it matter? I'll come back after the war. This is your home. Engine Room Artificer Vogel. You're under arrest. You're accused of desertion and treachery to the Third Reich. In the absence of a properly constituted court, I assume authority and sentence you to death. Have you anything to say? The sentence will be carried out immediately in the name of the Führer. "Investigations by the RCMP" have resulted in finding the remains of a Canadian Airways seaplane "similar to the one stolen by the five Nazis at Wolstenholme." Give me the glasses. - What for? - Food. - You can't eat them. - I can sell them. - They're his. - Come on, come on. They belong to the fatherland. It wouldn't let us starve. Would it? Congratulations, Lohrmann. No field glasses ever had a better end. We shall view the future better through these. - How much did he give you? - Seven dollars. Well, what are you waiting for? You saw what the bulletin said. They're watching the border. But they don't know there's only three of us. The police aren't fools. They'll find out soon enough. If we're caught, it won't matter if there are three or five or ten of us. We're changing our plans. We're going to Vancouver. Vancouver? A Japanese ship leaves Vancouver in a month. Is it far to Vancouver? - 2,000 kilometres. - We can never get as far as that. The Führer has never admitted the word "can't". Neither should we. Our one consideration must be how to get to... - Ham sandwich, sir? - How to get home. It doesn't matter how we do it, but we will get home. That's how he works. He says that it's Germany's destiny to rule Europe. It doesn't matter how she achieves that destiny, but she will achieve it. He gave me this. These Canadians give everything away. The road west is plain enough. Follow the River Assiniboine for 50 miles. Do we start now, Herr Leutnant? No. No, we'll sleep tonight in the railway station. Tomorrow we'll catch a bus outside the city limits and then walk. He wanted us to fly to Vancouver. Said it'd save a lot of time. - What did you say, Herr Leutnant? - I said we'd plenty of time. 2,000 kilometres is plenty of kilometres. Those are the Three Sisters Mountains. We're in the park now. Banff's National Park. Today's Indian Day. The biggest crowd of the year. There'll be thousands of Indians. You should stop over and see 'em. I have an appointment in Vancouver. You say these three men were here? Well, they were right here. Can you describe them? Let me see, now. There's only one that I would remember. Corporal! Ladies and gentlemen... Norman, I'm going to use your mike to talk to the crowd. Attention, please. The Mounted Police has reason to suspect that among this crowd are three enemies of this country. They are not ordinary aliens, escaped from Kananaskis Internment Camp. They are survivors from a German submarine, the notorious U-37, which was sunk in Hudson Bay by our air force. These men are here in this courtyard. They may be standing right next to you. Each one of you look closely at your neighbour. These are descriptions of the three men. One, who appears to be the leader, is a well-built man of medium height. He has very definite features, a commanding manner, is clean-shaven, brown hair. He wears a blue suit and tan shoes, and carries himself as if he'd been drilled. There is no very good description of the second man. He is thin and inconspicuous in his manner. He wears a suit that's a light colour and a hat tilted over his eyes. He may be carrying a bulky rucksack. The third man is short and dark. He wears no hat. He has a tweed jacket and a bow tie. He carries a parcel wrapped in oilcloth and tied with thick string. He is described as being nervous in his manner. I must ask all of you to stay exactly where you are and not talk or move. All of you, as citizens, can help to bring these men to justice. Each one of you look closely at your neighbour. Remember, each one of these men has every reason to be afraid. They've already been responsible for the death of 11 defenceless people. Sooner or later, their nerve will crack. Look closely at your neighbour. Corporal, there's your man! Herr Leutnant, there's a trail. Come on, then. Lost? Yes. That's a difficult trail on foot in those outfits. - You walked in from the lodge, I suppose? - Yes. Any plans? Plans? Well, it'll be dark in an hour. Moon doesn't rise till eleven. Lot of grizzlies on that trail. - Grizzlies? - Grizzly bears. Touchy beasts. You wouldn't like 'em. And they wouldn't like you. I see. Dinner! You're just in time. George will be pleased. Wa-ya-ta-be-te-no! Tricky things, aren't they? The great thing is just to sit still. - On holiday here? - Yes, on holiday. How do you find the lodge? They used to do you a very good lobster thermidor with a red Bordeaux. They still do you a lobster but no more red Bordeaux. A nuisance, isn't it? The war. Anyhow, up here in the Rockies, the war seems so remote, one can't take it so seriously. Of course one knows one half of humanity is trying to wipe out the other half, but... up here among the mountains and the spruce forests, one sees it in perspective. So that it... it seems almost unimportant. You've chosen a very beautiful place for your holiday. Yes, it is beautiful, isn't it? Actually, I'm here to work. On a book. - So you're a novelist? - Well, I... I write books. My specialty is Indians. This has been a hunting ground of theirs for generations. Then I... I suppose you were at Banff today? For Indian Day? No, no. That's just for tourists. I beg your pardon. Ship ahoy! Well, gentlemen, welcome to my humble tepee. Got two this time, George. I'm improving. And tell Bob two more for dinner. Well... It must be pleasant roughing it up here in the mountains. Yes, I rather like pigging it occasionally. I hope you won't mind taking pot luck with me. Here, have a cigarette. I see you're looking at my Picasso. It's nice, isn't it? Here. How do you feel about Matisse? I picked these up a year ago and I can't bear to be parted from them. How do you like it? Excellent. Yes, I don't think you two are really interested in pictures. Well, my motto is: "Wars may come and wars may go but art goes on for ever." You like reading, don't you? Have you seen Hemingway's latest? I'm going to show you one of my pets. There. Thomas Mann. The Magic Mountain. This is the German edition. This is wonderful stuff. "Sein Alter wäre schwer zu schätzen gewesen..." By the way, do you speak German? Have you read this book? Thomas Mann is very good, I believe. I'm so sorry. Of course you want a bath after your long climb. I'm afraid I can only offer you a shower. Come on, I'll show you. - Thank you very much, Mr... - Scott. Philip Armstrong Scott. Come on. Philip Armstrong Scott! Hot water. I feel completely confident tonight. If we'd twice as far to go, I wouldn't worry now. What could these weaklings ever do to us? The man's country's at war, and look at him! I tell you, Lohrmann, they're rotten to the core. There's no fight in them. They're soft and degenerate all through. No, I'll have cold. George, the fire's smoking! South-southeast by south. That's the ticket. Yes, I've discovered some rather amusing things during my researches. Blackfoot tribal customs, for instance, closely resemble those of a certain modern European tribe. I'm going to read you something about that. Where are we? "From the earliest age, their small boys were trained in the arts of war," which they considered the only pursuit worthy of a man. But they prefer to attack by night rather than by day, and wherever possible to shoot the enemy in the back. Their smaller neighbours lived in constant danger from them. They also believed in first terrorising their opponent "by covering themselves in war paint and beating loudly on their tribal drums." Well, doesn't that sound familiar to you? Familiar? - I don't quite understand. - Well, what price Goebbels? Very similar. Yeah, you see it, don't you? And listen to this. This is wonderful. Come here, sit down. Er... Yes. "When a tribal leader really desired to drive a point home", he used that most terrible of all public speakers' weapons - repetition. "Constant and unutterably wearisome repetition." Old man Hitler himself. What's wrong? I think he found it a little warm in here. I'm so sorry. Well, rather stuffy in there? A little. Lovely night, isn't it? The moon's just out. We're not the only ones up, I see. - The men? - When do they go to bed? Pretty early, as a rule. They please themselves. You must be rather tired yourself. - How about a nightcap before you turn in? - Thank you. Yes. Well... Interested? Have a drink? Well... happy dreams. OK. I thought you'd find it a bit chilly. We're 6,000 feet up here, you know. So you think you'll escape the war, Mr Scott? That's not a very nice way of putting it. But you'll do your best to escape it? Do you mean I'm... I wonder if I am. I don't think I'm a coward. I've never really been in any great danger. I don't know how I'd behave. - I can imagine how you'd behave. - I beg your pardon? I said I can imagine how you'd behave. Well, you are an extraordinary fellow. You're certainly frank. So you despise my mode of life? I'm getting some revelations tonight. It may do me good. Maybe I'm becoming smug. I imagined you'd been thinking... "Here's a nice, decent sort of chap." He invites me to dinner when he doesn't even know me. "Amiable, full of interesting conversation." And instead of that, you think I'm... Well, go on, what do you think I am? This will be enlightening. If you were a real man, you would have struck me when I said you were a coward. Instead of which, you talk about it. Well, why not? I write about the customs of Red Indians 200 years ago, but I don't have to behave like one. After all, we've been given reasoning powers and the gift of speech. Why don't we use them? Come on, have a cigarette. I don't think you're even a coward. I don't think you're a man at all. You must have had too much to drink. You'd both better get to bed. Is this gun loaded? - Of course it's loaded. - Then put your hands up. - What do you mean? - It's quite plain. Put them up! Well, well, well, this is a new experience. So I've been entertaining gangsters? Well, what do you want? Money or what? You don't believe he'd shoot you, do you? Such a thing couldn't happen to Mr Philip Armstrong Scott. Anything unpleasant must be kept as far away as possible. As far as the war 5,000 miles away. Suppose I were to tell you that the war is right here in this tent? I don't suppose you've heard of the U-boat sunk in Hudson Bay and the escaped Germans? So that's who you are. Nazis. Well, that explains everything. Your arrogance, your stupidity, your bad manners... Get over there by your books! Dear. Do I have to be tied up? Excuse us, Mr Scott. We still employ savage tribal methods. They get results. The best thing to happen to us is meeting you. You've put the heart back into us. There's only two of us now. Two out of six brave men. There are millions like us in Germany. Any more of your sort here, you don't stand a chance of winning this war. Get the clothes. They won't suit you. Not much there, I'm afraid. - 33 dollars. - Do I get a receipt? There's only one suit here. You'd better have the overcoat. Interesting. So far, I don't feel the least afraid. No sign of trembling. Pulse appears to be quite steady. Mouth a bit dry, perhaps. Here! Rifles. You feel happier now, don't you? Look out! Wars may come and wars may go, but art goes on for ever? Stop! Thomas Mann. Yes, I have read this book. We kicked this swine out of the Reich years ago. There's something else, too. Blackfoot Tribal Customs. Think yourself lucky we don't burn you too. Well, I never would have believed that grown-up men could behave like spiteful schoolboys. Have I said something to annoy you? Then I forget, anything reasonable annoys you. - Open your mouth. - One question, please. When Hitler's making a speech, just exactly what are your... Darn them horses. Stampeded again. Maybe they got wind of something. Maybe a bear. There! There they go! This way! Who's been leaving a saddle out here? Confound it! Here's another one. The boss must have gone crazy. What a mess. You've roused the whole camp. The horses were your idea. - You forget yourself, Lohrmann. - Save your breath, Hirth. Hey, Bob! They're gone down by the lake! - Hirth! Not that way! - Who are you talking to? - You're not my superior officer now. - Obey orders. Orders be...! Right. Come on, George! Art! Art! Where are you? Here, Mr Scott. On the trail. By a waterfall. Hurry. OK, boss. Coming. Bob! - Bob! - Over here! Bob! Bob! - Mr Scott wants you. - OK. - What happened, boss? - A hold-up. Those two fellows. - No? - Yes. - There's one of them. - Good old George! - Hello? - Right here! Coming your way. - Head him off. - Yippee! Let 'em all come. Where are you? - Looks like he's lost it. - Confound it! He's got it, the old bloodhound. Come on. Where is he, George? In the cave? What are we waiting for? Let's get him. - Which one of them is it? - I don't know. Did you see, George? Mr Scott! All right, boss? I forgot to tell you, Art. He's got my Colt, too. See that hole? That's going to cost him seven bucks before I let the Mounties get him. That means he's got four shots left. All right, Bob, I'll take over now. - OK, boss, but I don't think... - We ought to stay with you. - The papers say these men are killers. - Yes, the Canadian papers. The Nazi papers call them heroes. Two brave Nazis against 11 million Canadians. Say, Mr Scott! Mr Scott! Stop him! One. Two. Three. Four. That's the lot. It's you. I hoped it was the other fellow. That's for Thomas Mann! That's for Matisse! That's for Picasso! And... that's for me! All right, you can fetch him out now. Are you all right, boss? Well, you can't expect me to capture an armed Nazi without getting hurt a little. Here, let me have a look at that. The boss has knocked him cold. Well, he had a fair chance. One armed superman... against one unarmed decadent democrat. I wonder how Dr. Goebbels will explain that. Leutnant Hirth, wherever you may be on the North American continent, I hail you as the Paladin of the Third Reich, and the upholder of the honour of the great German people. By express order of the Führer himself, you have today been invested with the Iron Cross, First Class. Heil Hitler. Lethbridge, Alberta. Mounted Police pick up trail of escaping Nazi. At Lethbridge Airport, Kenyon Field, it's been established that a man resembling the wanted man, Lieutenant Hirth, planed in yesterday on Trip 22 from Edmonton in Calgary. The hearts of all sympathisers for the German cause go out to Leutnant Hirth. One man against 11 million. They know that even now the odds are not too heavy, when the one man represents the might of the Third Reich, and the 11 million a collapsing democracy. 48 hours have elapsed and still Lieutenant Ernst Hirth, the only surviving Nazi from the U-37, is at large. The whole world's eyes are on southern Ontario. The question of the hour is: Where is Hirth? You'll be OK here. - I'll tell you when we get to the Falls. - Thanks. What's your name? Forget it. I haven't seen you and you haven't seen me. Hello. Are you bumming a ride? Yes. You needn't be afraid of me. I won't tell on you. I'm not afraid. Looks like you've got a nice private car. Have a cigarette. Sit down. Thank you. Coming from Toronto? - Yes. - Living there maybe? - No. - Quite a place, Toronto. I didn't see much of it. - Are you from the West? - I've been there. Vancouver? - Yes. - That must be a beautiful city, Vancouver. I didn't stay there long either. - You don't stay long anywhere, do you? - I travel about a good deal. Travel about. That's a lot of fun. When I was a kid, I had the big idea to see the whole of Canada. But things don't work out the way you think. I save a bit of money and what do I do? Put it in my pocket and start off down the road, my own boss, with the whole of Canada in front of me? Not on your life. I buy a bit of land up Beamsville way. That keeps me so busy, that's about all of Canada I see. Have a shot of Ontario wine. Catawba. I send the grapes to the winery from my own farm. - Sherry type. - Thank you. Got a kick like a mule. Where was I? Yeah. Sometimes I think I'll take a holiday. But do I take a holiday? Not a bit of it. I take a wife. Say, were there any MPs around while you've been here? - MPs? - Military Police. Are you in trouble with the police? Not exactly what you'd call trouble. I just don't want to meet them. - Are you a soldier? - Well, that's a matter of opinion. It's what I joined up to be. The government said, "We want men to fight the Nazis. Join today." So I joined. I figured they were in a hurry. That was 387 days ago. Four divisions and a lot of drafts have gone overseas and what's Number B987642 doing? Guarding the Chippawa Canal. Who'd want to steal it anyway? Well, I guess I'd better climb back into my battle-rompers. - So the government's treated you badly? - What do you think? I didn't enlist to play nursemaid. I enlisted to knock hell out of the Nazis. I'm about as close to getting my hands on a Jerry now as I was at the beginning. We don't eat so good. Holy Maganow. Beef three times a day. Haven't tasted parsnips since I joined the army. - I'm fond of parsnips, too. - Why are you afraid of the police? Who's afraid of the police? I just overstayed my leave eight days. That is a serious offence in wartime. - It is with my CO. - You're a deserter. Deserter, my Royal Canadian foot! I'm just independent. You're a deserter because you have a grievance against your government. Say, where did you pick up those five-gallon words? - You have a good suit. - Sure it's a good suit. Paid 25 bucks for it two years ago. - And along comes that heel Hitler. - It's a very good suit. It's a dandy suit. Just now, most of the boys are wearing these. Yes. Well, I'm a son of a... Stand up! Put your hands up! Stand over there. Unless you're anxious to be shot, you won't move. I'm perfectly ready to kill you or anyone else. Yeah, I can see you are. 14 drums of carbide. - Don't move. - Who's moving? Nine cans of germicide. OK. Everything checks all right. OK, seal her up. Now look what you've done! I am a deserter now! - What do you mean? - They're taking us out of the country. - We're crossing the border now. - Into America. Heil Hitler. You dirty Nazi! - Yes, I'm a Nazi. Heil Hitler! - One of them off the U-boat. Quite right, my friend. In two minutes, I shall be across the border. Once, there were six of us. Now I represent them all. Field Marshal Göring has said, "It doesn't matter if we've only one plane and one man left so long as victory is ours." Do you hear that? We've beaten these dirty democracies, these weaklings. It's something inside us, beyond the dim, muddied minds of you in the democracies. What do you know of the glorious mystical ties of blood and race that unite me with every German Aryan? When I step on American soil, I won't be alone. Adolf Hitler and all the great German people will be with me. It's not the Canadian people we're against. It's your filthy government, the whole democratic system. You don't like it any more than I do. You don't like the job they gave you. You don't like the food. Why, you spoon-fed louse! I can grouse about the food and the CO and anything I plain please. And that's more than you with your Gestapo and your storm troopers and your Aryan bushwa. Nuts! What's the good of talking to you? You can't even begin to understand democracy. We own the right to be fed up with anything we damn please, and say so out loud when we feel like it. When things go wrong, we can take it. We can dish it out, too. Hey, Eddie, wait a minute. Hold the door. Thanks. Hey, Eddie. You check and I'll mark. How about you checking and me marking for a change? Go on, wrestle some boxes. It'll be good for you. Sure, sure. Hey! Lady Godiva! Who are you two? Andrew Brock. Canadian Active Service Force. And you? - We're on American territory? - Yes. I'm Ernst Hirth, a German citizen. I demand to be taken to a German consul. Don't do it! Send him back. He's an escaping Nazi. That's my uniform! Hey, this gun's loaded. By your law, you must take me to my consul. - Is that right? - I'm afraid it is. - He's one of that gang off the submarine. - He is? I am Leutnant Hirth of the German navy and a German citizen... Send him back. He's not just any Nazi. The whole of Germany is waiting to see him escape. I know. I read the papers. Hey, couldn't we sort of... you know? - You mean... - Yeah. No. By your law, you must take me to a consul. We've got too many laws. Don't let him pull that law stuff! You know better than that, soldier. I'm a Customs inspector. This is for the Immigration Department. My job is inspecting freights and imports. Listen, Captain, what would you do if he were an illegal shipment of cheese? Return him. But he's a human being. At least, he's a Nazi. - He's not on the manifest, is he? - What? He's not on the manifest! - No. - No. No, he's not. - The American law... - Shut up! - How do you check? - Same way. Two unlisted items. But your law refers to freight, not to persons. This is a freight car and you're freight. - Tell the engineer to return this car. - OK. Phone those Canucks and tell 'em it's coming with two items missing from the manifest. Tell 'em to either list 'em or take 'em off. Check. Thanks, Colonel. Thanks a million. We've all got to do our duty, soldier. I'll send your gun back to the Mounties. OK. I don't need it. I protest! You cannot do this! It's illegal! Sonny boy, I've done it. Hello, Macaulay? It's Eddie speaking. We're sending back car number 8772. Gee, you guys are getting careless. There's two items not in the manifest. List 'em or take 'em off. Put 'em up, Nazi. No, not that way. This way. Cos I'm not asking for those pants. I'm just taking 'em.
