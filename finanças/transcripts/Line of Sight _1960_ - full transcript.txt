That winter... had been unlike any other. Now the Château is deserted. Deserted by us. I had to leave the Château. Two summers had gone by. For two years, I only wandered. I wanted to see the Château again. Paris had not changed. Paris had not changed. But the Château... I had left it without knowing the true reason of my departure. For all of us the Château had meant something different. Paris had not changed. The Château was there... just like before. Far from everything, like me. So? What? I don't know, you're not saying anything. - Good evening, Pedro. - Good evening. I had almost forgotten Mr. Gordo's face. Forgotten that nothing surprised him. My return left him indifferent. That winter had been unlike any other. I wanted to know what was going on at the Château George, I'll need the keys to the Pontiac. - Your brother took them. - What brother? What, Bernard has come home? No, the one with the mustache. Pedro? Damn! Mr. Gordo suggested that I stay at the Château. As he once did in the past after my father's death. He hadn't seen my brothers in months. They too had left the Château. I had spent that winter at the Château. It was a winter unlike any other. It was a winter unlike any other. I wanted to know what was going on at the Château. What the hell are you doing here? It's not my fault if I'm here. Eugène told me you had arrived. It's not my fault. Really, you should understand. I've got nothing to do with it. It's Eugène! Listen, buddy! I'm very tired. You understand? So, think about it. - I'm going for a walk. - Fine, go for a walk. Why did I come back? Now the Château is deserted. Deserted by us. Alright, let's hear it! Here's how it goes, sir. I didn't know you had come back. It's not me. It's Eugène who told me... Enough with your Eugène! You're not gonna tell me Eugène was the one who played pool came to see Mr. Paco who drove the truck! Is he putting on your pants in the morning? No it's me. -Is Eugène the one drunk when you drink? -No. Eugène might be the one who dies if I kill you! No, sir! It's me! Ah? Let's hear it then. Here goes. Do you remember two years ago? I worked for a week. But I wasn't paid. And how much is one week of your work worth? I don't know, about 20 000 francs. Since you knew the boss, I thought maybe you... Well, I'm sorry for you, buddy. Because I killed your boss. Was it you? You're the one who killed him? I had almost forgotten what winter was. And the snow too. It was mostly Pascale I would have liked to see again. I remembered the others but I didn't care. Here. I finished your book. How dreadful! Why did you read it if it's dreadful? You're bothering me! So, when am I going to the Château? You'd find it dreadful too. How would you know? ♪ ?????? ♪ c'est ça ??? pas dessus What do your friends have that I don't? They go everywhere with you. And meanwhile, I have to wait! - Don't mix everything up! - You don't care about me, do you? You're mixing everything up. My friends are my friend. You're different. You're the housewife. The housewife? You haven't looked at me! In the 20th century, with all the books I read? You're joking! You're crazy! You're very well-read, I know. Very cultured. But let me tell you, as soon as I'm done singing here tonight - I'm going to the Fado! - Then I'm coming with you! I lived in Paris during the night. The Fado was a bit like home to me. It's really great here. Can you see how handsome the singer is? What about me? Well... well, you're not bad. Something wrong? No. No. Where are you going? Why the hell would you care? The singer's handsome, isn't he? Sometimes I would meet with Marc and Pascale. Marc was a singer, like me. He was happy anywhere. I liked him. Pascale and him were really good together. - How is business? - Good. Especially the sells of shoelaces. Would you believe I'm selling twice as many compared to last year? It's beyond understanding! A rush! Did you change lengths or models? No, it's still the same Did one of your competitors stopped production? No, they're all selling more than ever. Then, it's beyond understanding. What matters in this whole thing is not to understand. But to sell! That's what I'm always telling my wife. Sometimes, I crossed paths with a strange character. He was one of the Château's mysteries. I didn't try to understand why he was here. It's always night in the Château. - Good evening, Pedro. - Good evening. Who's winning? Why do you care? Why do I care? So? What? I don't know. You're not saying anything. We're playing. No one cared about what I was doing. The Château was mine. Far from everything, like me. With its rooms, always empty. And its loneliness. The Château was mine. No one ever came. Well, almost no one. One couldn't guess what was about to happen. He was often still here when I got back. His presence started to intrigue me. Couldn't the little one with a mustache come with us? -The little one with a mustache? -Yes. The one who waiting with his pool and his guitar. Who? Pedro? Did you say anything to him? No, Mr. Gordo. He seemed to know. Hello? Hi! How are things? Huh? The Cricket and the Ant? He doesn't know The Cricket and the Ant? At his age? Good luck getting to sixth grade! How should I know The Cricket and the Ant? From memory? Hmm, wait... "The cricket... having sung all summer long Hmm... Come in! Hi. No it's nothing. Begging her to lend her... A little grain so she’d survive Until the new season". Well listen, I don't know. Just find a little book... You decide. Goodbye. "The cricket having sung all summer long Found herself most destitute When the north wind blew She went to her neighbor... - The ant. - Begging her... - Begging her! - To lend her... - Luckily, I had it earlier. How are you? Fine. What about you? You're both invited to the Château tomorrow. What Château? Marc and pascale had something I didn't. But I didn't envy them. I had the Château. I loved it as one loves someone. So it's true? Pedro lives in a Château. Yes, it's true. We're driving there with one of his brothers' car. - Can I drive? - It's quite a drive, you know? I don't mind. OK, but be careful. It's not ours. Are we picking Pedro up? No, he's waiting for us there. Who owns the Château? An uncle, who took him and his brothers in. Do your hair! - Don't worry about it - Shall we? Come, let's go inside. Wait, do we need slippers? Don't worry about it. Alright, I'll do as I'm told. I didn't know how to make them feel comfortable. You can tuck in. I don't know what's left... Are you hungry? A little. I'm not. You're not? Bernard came into the living room without a word to anyone. As usual. He didn't notice the people surrounding him. We almost didn't see him anymore these days. He deserted the Château for a life I knew nothing about. Henri had already preferred another life to that of the Château. Can I have some? You're not going to drink it all, are you? You're pushing it, Pedro. It won't end well. - Worry about your chicken. - Are you drunk? That's not chicken. That evening was a disappointment. For all of us, the Château meant something different. Hélène's arrival didn't change a thing. Good evening. What are you doing here? But... Bernard didn't tell you? What a jerk! No. He didn't tell me. If you knew the rain we had on the way here. From start to finish. Without interruption. We had the same here, you know. - Good evening. - Good evening. It's too bad about the weather... I wonder if we'll be able to hunt tomorrow. Do you like hunting? Yes, a lot. I've never hunted. Really? Well, you didn't come here to hunt anyway. We did, in a way. Well, I've never done it so it could be interesting. It is. Well, please sit down. Yes, thank you. Bernard lived with Hélène. Marc had Pascale. As for me, I didn't want to bring the girls I knew to the Château. I didn't like them. Pascale? Are you cold? Are you cold, Pascale? - No. - You are, I'll get you a sweater. - Wait, I'll get it. - My guitar is out of tune, I'll go. I'll get you your tuner? Where is it? In the glove box. Alright. Pedro, come here. In the courtyard... There's a truck with a strange guy. He has one of these faces! What is it? - In the courtyard? - Yeah. Give me the rope. Here. There you go. Where are you going? Outside. This didn't concern Marc. Or the others, for that matter. It was Mr. Gordo's business. We needed to ignore it. I needed to ignore it as well. But that night, Bernard was with Hélène And Marc with Pascale. I acted against in spite of myself. And against Mr. Gordo without knowing it. Is Mr. Paco here? - Yes, it's for the...? - Yes, it's for the crates. For the crates... - You want to see the boss? - No, Mr. Paco. - Mr. Paco? - Yes. - Is he expecting you? - Yes, he is. Alright, I'll ask. Mr. Gordo was with a man I had never seen before. They both seemed very focused on their work. Perhaps Mr. Gordo was surprised to see me. But he didn't show it. All of this didn't get me anywhere. The others must have wondered where I was. Pascale had gone to bed. As for me, I think I remember having drunk a little. - What are you drinking? - A gin and tonic. What are you doing with two glasses? Two glasses? You're seeing double, buddy. Am I really? Is that all that's left from the star? Yes, that's all that's left. Thank you. Give me some. Be careful or I'll know your thoughts. Nothing could have foretold the following day's snow. Nothing was happening. Winter had come. Hélène and Bernard had left during the night. So had Mr. Gordo. Marc and Pascale were the only ones left at the Château. Winter had come. Don't drink any. It's too sweet. Let me have a taste. You like it sweet? No, I don't like it. - It's too sweet. - Pour it on the cookies. Just a little... Ugh, it's disgusting... It's disgusting... To my health! - You could cheer to mine at least! - To your health then! Thank you. You have good manners. Drink to mine then! No, you've drunk for the both of us. I'll get something else. I can't drink this. - Again? - Yes, but something different. Marc and Pascale had something I didn't. As for me, I only had the Château. I only had the Château. Marc visited my grounds. Let's play. You're 27. I'm 50. You are curious. I'm not anymore. You would like to know what's going on here. And you like to take unnecessary risks. I don't want you to take any. I'm 27. I am curious. I would like to know what's going on here. And I like to take unnecessary risks. But I didn't know I should fear anything from you. You know very well you have nothing to fear from me, Pedro. Neither do you. So, why are you telling me all this? In case... It seems you don't me well enough, Mr. Gordo. "The bird sings The wind blows Time flies. The lamb bleats The wolf howls The brook flows". It's for my new song. Your song will be very nice, Pedro. Good evening, Pedro. Good evening, Mr. Gordo. The next day, it rained. Do you have the time, sir? 10:25. Is it true a rocket went around the moon? Look, there. Thank you. What about the Russians and the Americans? You're 27. You are curious. You would like to know what's going on here. And you like to take unnecessary risks. You know very well you have nothing to fear from me, Pedro. May I know why you're following one of our drivers. I wanted to know what was going on at the Château. And fate dictated where I would go. So, what is this all about? Here goes. Since my father died, us three brothers, have lived at the Château. Mr Gordo's Château. So we're bound to find out about certain things. You're a wise-ass, aren't you? He was telling me everything. A traffic. Crates passing through the Château. Blackmail. He was using Mr. Gordo. Now, he was threatening us. My brothers and I don't like this. So I'll make you a proposal. Either you come get your weapons from the Château and you leave Mr. Gordo alone. Or else... Or else, you'll see. Fine. I'll see. December. January. Nothing was happening anymore. I waited. - Good evening, Pedro. - Good evening. I waited. The days went by. Mr. Gordo didn't notice me anymore. Each day seemed like the day before. The Château... Pascale... Let me go! That night as usual, I was in Paris. You like to stand out! No, not anymore. Well, you're a pretty good singer. Why are you sad? Are you sad because I'm here? - Do you want me to leave? - No. You'd rather run away? The Château was not the same anymore. Yet, My life went on as before. My life went on as before. But I already knew that things can't remain the same forever. Henri had reported the man from the Champs-Élysées to the police. I felt responsible. Mr. Gordo was away. I didn't want the Château to be compromised. But I didn't know what Bernard planned to do. I felt responsible. Hélène had taken advantage from Mr. Gordo's absence. She had invited a few friends. Marc and Pascal were the only ones left. Maybe they were waiting for me. Maybe they wondered why I hadn't come. Please have a drink! Cheers. Thank you. Play my song. Your song? You know, it'd be nice if it wasn't so slow. Well, we'll see. Play it anyway. With some joy if possible... You play really well. No one can say different. So are you playing or not? I wanted to know what was going on at the Château. And fate dictated where I would go. Watch out. Go. Bernard hadn't told me what he had planned. But I wasn't worried. I wanted to know what was going on at the Château. And fate had given me a role to play. And then, the events had led me wherever they wanted OK. Congratulations, you caught us. Let me see your hands. What? There were weapons in the crates. Bernard made them disappear. The investigation that followed was unfruitful. My story could have ended there. Since everything had worked itself out. But actually, that was perhaps the day it really began. I had changed. Maybe because life had given me a role to play. The Château didn't mean anything to me anymore. Without a purpose, I started to wander in Paris. For entire nights. I missed the Château. I didn't want to see Pascale again. I had changed. I already knew I would be leaving. I just needed a little time to get used to this idea. I saw the Château as it was. Sad. Places don't live by themselves. I always saw the same images in the lights. The walls of the city suffocated me. Winter was ending. Winter was ending. No one cared about what I was doing anymore. My life had resumed like before. But I was set on leaving. It was on a Sunday. Marc and Pascale. Dead already. What country were they off to? To what disaster? I was their only friend. They have come to the Château only once. I didn't know how to make them feel comfortable. Now, they only live in me. Like the Château. No one can remember it but me. He's got a nerve! Bloody feet... Shit! Pedro... Asshole... "Oh I've got a Château you know". ♪ ??????????????????????????? ♪ alors les nuances ??? Can't believe he's my brother. Good thing I look nothing like him. That big potato. ♪ ???????????????????????????? ♪ plus vain ??? chiottes bon point bon bouleau Anyway... "You are now listening to one of Claude Bolling's last compositions" Ah! Henri! I'm happy to see you. I arrived yesterday. I took the Pontiac to see Mr. Gordo. I went with him and then he cleared off. He pisses me off. Hey. What? Aren't you happy to me? Well, let's not push it. Listen, Henri. Yeah? Come here. Did you learn to be mean like that in high school? I'm not in high school anymore. I'm studying for Science Po. You can laugh all you want. You couldn't even get through high school. - Henri? - Yeah? You wouldn't know by any chance where is Bernard? No. I don't have a clue. I looked for Bernard everywhere in Paris. For entire nights. He had disappeared without leaving a trace. His friends hadn't seen him in months. Mine didn't recognize me. I wish I could have started everything over. It was impossible. I needed to leave. I needed to leave. I just needed a little time to get used to this idea.
