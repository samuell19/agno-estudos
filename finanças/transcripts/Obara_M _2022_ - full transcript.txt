Papa, why are we going through... Let's go through the Vestry. But your Tricycle is there. - Er, it's not... - Papa Oluchi? Ah, papa Oluchi. Teacher Pius, good evening. Teacher Pius. - Good to see you. - It's good to see you too. - Papa Oluchi. - Yes. I have been looking everywhere for you. - Really? - Yes. - Ihunaya? - Sir. Didn't you tell your father that I've been sitting, waiting for him? - No... He, she never... - Papa? I told you. She told you? - You mean she told you, papa Oluchi? - That's what I'm saying. - No papa, you're supposed to... - It's okay. Keep quiet, Ihunaya. So, what can I do for you, teacher Pius? - What can you do for me? - Yes. Papa Oluchi, please can you step aside? Let's talk in private. - No, no... Okay. It's alright. - Yeah. - Papa? - Yes? I'm sorry that I told teacher Pius that I told you he was looking for you. No, you did nothing wrong. That was good. You did the right thing. But papa, he collected money from you. Look, I don't have to be angry with you. I know that. He collected money from me. The money he collected from me was for your own good. It's for your future. - Hmm? - I don't understand. You won't understand now but teacher Pius is a very nice man. Trust him. He's a good man. Hmm? - Okay papa. - Okay. Don't think about it. Thirty Eight, Thirty Nine and Forty. - Have this. - Ah, ah! Didn't you just count forty? - Yes, it Forty. - Our money is Fifty. - That was before. - Ahn-ahn! - Things have changed. - Since when? Since I started running at a loss. Please, RK it's unfair. Yes, you said it. You yourself know it's unfair, because for the past six months, you and your band have been singing the same song. Dance the same dance with the same outfit for six months. I was even expecting that you and your band will change but no. Now you're here saying this. Yes, it unfair to me. - Hmm? - Yes. You said we've been singing the same song for the past six months? With the same outfits. - Dancing the same dance? - Yes of course. Okay. What about you? Haven't you been selling the same liquor to your customers for the past six months. Are you crazy? We're okay, enjoy yourself. We're good, we're good. Okay? Come oh, you're disrespecting me in this business now. Are you interrogating me? Did my customers complain to you that the liquor is tasteless? Did my customers campaign to you that they want change? But you guys still continue... I wanted to lay you off. There are other groups out there. Hungry, begging for work. Even if I give them 10,000 they'll dance. RK, calm down, it hasn't come to that. You know how this music hustle is. It's not easy for any of us. We're just trying to manage it. - I know. - Eh? And you're aware there's no other band in this town can perform better than us. I know. Your band is sophisticated. Very sophisticated. I like it. But try and switch it up once in a while. That's why the saying goes, "Variety is spice..." - "Spice is the variety of life." - "...Pepper soup" Now this is your food. Say your prayers and eat your food. But papa, what about you? Are you not going to eat? Don't worry about papa. You know? After service, I went somewhere and I ate a heavy lunch. So I'm not hungry, hmm? - But papa... - When I say eat your food, eat your food. Okay? - Papa? - Yes my dear. Were you trying to call sister Oluchi? Why do you ask? Because I saw her number on your phone. This girl, nothing gets past you. Yes, I was trying to call sister Oluchi on the phone. And did she pick your call? No, she didn't pick my call. - Papa? - Hmm? Papa, have faith, one day sister Oluchi will pick your call. Ihunaya, I don't want you to worry yourself with things you shouldn't worry yourself with. Now, okay, I want to sing you to sleep. What lullaby now will sooth you and make you sleep? Okay. Let me sing something so cultural and so matured. Hmm? Are you ready? Yes. Something you have not heard before. What are you doing? You're bringing your singing instrument. Okay. Now listen. Are you listening? Yes. Always never far from me Always never far from me Closer than my sister More like a lover You never stray far from me Even though sometimes I push you away Even in those times though Your promises never failed you Always been here Always been near. Always with me Always Always been good Always be true. Always This is the money RK paid us. - How much did he pay? - Thirty thousand. - Thirty thousand? - Yes. - For what? - That not enough. Wait, why did you take the money from him? Oh, you think I was happy collecting the money from him? I'm sure he's cheating us. One day I'll deal with him. Calm down. Don't let him hear you. What will happen if he heard me? He said he'll replace us. Keep shouting. - Huh? - Why? He said we sing the same song, wear the same outfit, dance the same dance for the past six months. But I actually think we should change our game. Not that our songs are not melodious. Same song every time? He sells same liquor every time as well. - Brand is brand. - That was what I told him as well. - Oh! - Of course. What did he say? He said his mom is crazy. That's why I like you. Oluchi, that's why I like you. You're... You're a she goat. You're mad. Looks like you want to trek home. If I give you your share, call me a she goat. Papa? Papa? Papa? Papa? Papa, papa? Papa wake up! Papa wake up! Papa? Papa? Papa? Papa? Hello Aunty, good afternoon. Oluchi... your father is dead. Why? Tell me why Why did you leave at a time like this? With so many things unsaid And many things unfinished Why, tell me why Why do you have to go? Why was it you He chose To take away from me Trying to convince myself That I'll see you some day But by here right now I don't believe what I'm seeing Trying to convince myself that We'd be together some day But right here right now You're gone with the wind My heart cries and bleeds sometimes -I think, I will not see you again -I will not see you again Goodbye is easy to say But at the of the day -I will not see you again -I will not see you again -I will not see you again -I will not see you again -I will not see you again -I will not see you again Lord, have mercy on us. Girls of these days! Ha! Now that her papa has died, she's coming to pretend to cry If I'm her papa's ghost I will disturb her every night A child grew and forgot Her father and her younger one Bro, my guy, this is the thing Someone should think twice Before praying for a child Cos how can a man live A life just to raise a child When the child grows she Won't remember her papa Abomination! I'm not gossiping but see, this matter is annoying Eh? Chai Oluchi. Girl, I'm ashamed of you How can someone Be so wicked even to her family? Oh she thinks she's wise That's why she ran to the city Now it's clear to her Now she wants empathy I won't join the people pitying her Cos this girl is a witch This girl Oluchi She's been in Lagos following con men dey to cruise big toys And the men have used her destiny for ritual purposes I hear she's a musician Who is she deceiving? Please let's leave the matter For God. Let's try and focus I will not see you again ‪Goodbye is easy to say But at the end of the day ‪-‪I will not see you again ‪-‪I will not see you again -I will not see you again -I will not see you again -I will not see you again -I will not see you again What will Oluchi do? What will Oluchi do? What will Oluchi do? I thought you'd bring Ihunaya along with you. I actually wanted to talk to you in private, ma. Well... Please give this to her. And make sure you tell her it's from me. Oh, okay ma. I will. You'd better be careful with that girl. She has got a sharp mouth. And a sharper brain to go with it. Ah! Eh... Aunty, that's what I even want to talk to you about, ma. Aunty? You know you're my favorite aunty in the whole wide world. - And I don't have anybody but you. - Oluchi? Say what you've come to say, I have things to do. Aunty, can Ihunaya stay with you - just for... - She cannot stay with me. No, Aunty, I'm not even done with what I wanted to say. There's nothing to finish. She cannot stay with me. - She will not stay with me. - Ahn-ahn. And if she stays with me. What would you be doing in Lagos? Aunty, is just for... for a short time. It's not for long. It's just till I settle down. You probably think you're wise. Do you know how many times your father has come here to borrow money from me? If you could not give him that money while he was alive, is it now that he's dead that you're going to give it to me? Aunty, that's a different case. Did I send him to borrow money from you? Did I? I didn't send anybody a message. Ahn-ahn. Can you hear how stupid you are? Instead of you... To be sober, and think, and know, your father probably died from worrying about where he would get money to pay your child's school fees. And Ihunaya is your responsibility. It's about time you stopped running away from it and faced it. Aunty, I'm not running away from anything. Am I not seated here? I left her at home and came down here. Where am I running to? If I actually wanted to run away I would have done so while leaving her at home. I'm just saying you should please help me to hold her for a period of time. So that I can focus on my work. I... I'm working. When I had Ihunaya. I took her to the orphanage. He went there to bring her back. I told him not to but he refused. So... The fact that he didn't have money to train her is not my business. I didn't request for anyone's help. I am going to close my eyes... and sleep a little. By the time I open them, if you're still here... whatever you see, you take! What's inside this envelope. What is this? Letter? No money? Ahn-ahn! What is this? What is Ihunaya going to do with wedding rings? So this woman couldn't put money in this envelope for her? I know what to do. - Eh... - Oluchi, is that you? - Chinwe! - Hey! - How are you? - I'm fine. - How are you? - I'm fine. - How have you been? - I'm Okay. - How's Ihunaya? - Ihunaya is fine. Okay. But you know you need to take care of her now? Okay. - All your attention needs to be on her. - Okay, okay. No problem. We'll try our best. Now that you're still around, what's up? Ah, that's why I'm here. Er, I need money. - Huh? - I said I need money. From where, my dear? In this hard time. Maybe you don't understand. I'm not here to borrow or collect money from you. Okay? There's something I want to sell, that you'll pay me. Okay. - My dear? - Yes. - My dear, these are quite fine. - Mm-hmm. Where did you get them from? I think they belong to my parents. - Your parents? - Mm-hmm. - You want to sell their wedding rings? - Mm-hmm. -These are your heirlooms -What is heirlooms? Please, forget about it. Are you buying or not? - I don't think you should sell it. - Really? Okay. No problem. Let me go and find who will buy it. - Oluchi? - What is it? - Oluchi? - What is it? Please come. What is it? How much will you sell it? What are you doing? - I'm reading. - Why are you reading? I don't understand that question. I said why are you reading, are you not on holiday? I like to read. "I like to read." You're the only one who knows how to read. Before I forget. Why is it open? Because I opened it. Why did you open it? Because I needed to see what was inside. Don't you know it's rude to open other people's things without their permission? So, because I helped you carry something from aunty Nwaka's place, I'm now the rude one? No, you're rude because you opened it. You shouldn't have even opened it. You opened the letter. No problem, give it to me. Give it to me. Let me return it back to her so you'll go and collect it yourself. I'll give it back to you on one condition. Hey... look at this little girl. You're even giving me conditions. Okay. Hmm. What's the condition? - Give me back my, "Thank you." - What? Which thank you? When you dropped it I said thank you. So you have to give me back my thank you and I'll give you back your envelope. So, how do you give people back their "thank you"? I don't know, you're the adult so you tell me when you know. So now I'm the adult, right? My friend, just make sure you pack your things before tomorrow morning. Why am I packing? Because I'm going to Lagos tomorrow. If you're going to Lagos tomorrow, why am I the one packing? Because you're coming with me. When are we coming back? Coming back to where? Here of course. Here, to do what? This is our house and I have school. I don't have time for this your sharp mouth today. You keep questioning me everyday. Just make sure you do as you're told. Pack your things. Pack your things, get them ready before tomorrow morning. I'm not packing. - Excuse me? - I don't want to go to Lagos. Let me just warn you. If you don't get ready before tomorrow morning, I'll deal with you. Why will you deal with me? Eh, eh, eh... Look at this child... I'll break your head. You cannot break my head because you're not my mother. My dear Ihunaya, If you're reading this, it means I'm no longer with you. I want you to know that I will always love you. Oluchi will take over your responsibilities from now. Please don't give her a hard time. So you mean you live here all by yourself? Yes. It's nice. Thank you. You like it? No, I'm just saying it to be polite. Don't worry you'll like it here. I don't want to like it here. Why can't we just stay back at papa's house? Because I work here, okay? Enough of the questions, please go upstairs. Why does your room look like this? Like how? Like this. - Where is your bed? - Are you blind? What's this here? This, is a mattress. There is a difference between bed and mattress. - Okay. So, what do you do with a bed? - You sleep on it. - And what do you do with a mattress? - "You sle..." You think you're wise? My friend, remove that thing. You should even be happy that there's a bed for you to sleep. It's fish and meat. Ihunaya. I'm coming When did you cook it? Must you ask questions? - I was just wondering when... - Shut up. You're always wondering. Take this thing. Bring it let me give you fish. The food is really nice. - I thought you cooked it? - Mm-hmm. Do you want more? Yes. Okay take. - It is empty! - Come on, shut your mouth. "It's empty." My friend, carry this thing and go wash these plates. You may find out some things about Oluchi that I failed to tell you. But I want you to know that I did it to give her a chance. And Oluchi, if you're reading this I want you to know that I love you. And I forgive you. - Yes. Whose there? - It's me. What do you want? I want to use the toilet. Can't it wait? No. Hold on. Ahn-ahn! Madam, hold on. What took you so long? My friend, will you go inside and use the toilet you want to use?! - Aunty Oluchi. - What is it? There are people at the door. Oluchi! And so, sleep. Come, this girl, I'll fling you. There are people at the door, I think they're thieves. They're not thieves. Just leave them, let them be doing their thing. - Really? - I will use my left hand to slap you. Forget that you're my boyfriend, I'll slap you. Oluchi! I heard them. Bishop it's you. Don't you realize I was sleeping? Why are you banging at my door? What happened? - I have a little kid that's sleeping. - Madam, who ate the food in the kitchen? Who are you? Me? Are you mad? - You have the audacity to eat my food. - Your food? - And you're now telling me rubbish. - Your food? Do you even know how to cook? - Please, Bishop who cooked the food? - I did. That is not the point, madam. You ate my food. - Okay. I'll make it up to you. - You... You are the visitor here. That girl walk all over you. She has no regard or respect for you and you're talking. You're a shameful man. - Do you have respect for me? - No I don't. I told you to leave it alone, we'll chat it in the morning, but you refused to. Isn't that a sign of disrespect? My dear, I don't need to have respect for you. You don't understand. I'm sleeping with you. She on the other hand, ate my food. The food is mine. I made it. - For me. - Don't be upset. - I shouldn't get upset? - Calm down. I shouldn't get upset? Hey - Ihunaya, right? - Yes. I'm Bishop. Your mother's house mate. My mother's what? So you think aunty Oluchi is my mother? She's not my mother. She's my elder sister. Oh, my bad. My bad. - Anyway, em... - Ihunaya! Who's there? It's me, Bishop. How was your trip here? Fine. - Ahn-ahn. - Ahn-ahn. - Bishop. - Oluchi, how are you? - How have you been? - I'm okay. You don't know how to greet? Good morning sir. - Good morning. - If I don't tell you to greet, ‪-you don't know you're supposed to greet. ‪-It's okay. We need to talk. Hmm? If it's about what happened last night, it's fine. You don't need to apologize, hmm? Just tell your babe to calm down. Wait, I don't understand. What are you saying? What am I... What do I need to apologize for, Oluchi? Ahn-ahn! Didn't you witness what your babe did last night? Oluchi... you're crazy. Eh, eh... I think you are crazy. Don't come here and insult me this morning. I'm warning you. See, let me tell you now... My aunty is not mad. I don't understand. I made a food for Charity, both of you came and you swallowed it See, I chewed my own. - I don't care. - Hey! - Get out. - Eh! Shut up. Don't shout at her. - Is something wrong with you? - Go and brush your teeth. - Don't try it. - Do you own the food? I live here and I pay my rent. Don't ever shout at her. Do you understand me? - Because the landlord doesn't live here. - Please get out. You're mad. - Please leave here. - Come back here. - Come back where? - That's not why I'm here - Come back. - And you think I'll come back. You're crazy. - Bring your money please. - Which money? Money for gas and electricity. Hey, you're a very wicked man. I don't understand, what's the "Hey" all about? Won't you pay? You are asking me for money, when you know I just buried my father. I used all my money to bury my father. I don't have any money with me. I have used all my money. - All my money to bury that man. - Nice one. It's okay. It's okay. I'll give you two weeks for you to put yourself together. When I come back make sure my money is ready. I'll put my fingers inside your turkey eyes. You look like uncooked eba.

She said you didn't spend five naira. Shut your mouth! Don't you know you're not to believe everything you're told? That aunty Nwaka, she has big a mouth. I'll tell her. Go and tell her. Who cares? You think I'm scared of her? Don't say I didn't warn you. Shut up there. Aunty Oluchi? How old are you? Why do you ask? Are you very old? Excuse me? If you're not very old, why does that man think you're my mother? Which man? Uncle Bishop. What did you tell him? The obvious, that you're not my mother, you are my elder sister. Aunty Oluchi? Between you and papa, who's older? Are you mad? - Oluchi? - Hmm? Is everything alright? Everything like what? Like you. The AC is on. And at 16 degrees you're still sweating. Do you mind if I ask you another question? If I say no will it stop you from asking me? - No. - Okay, what do you want? When was the last time you took your... You know what I mean. How does it concern you? How does it concern you? Devil. Are you doing it because of Ihunaya? You don't want her to know you smoke. It's true but your voice is too low. Shout it.

I'm not hungry. ‪Hey, I apologize for hitting you. You pushed me. You called me a prostitute. Ihunaya, you can't call your mother a prostitute. Oh now you're my mother. I've always been your mother. No, you've not. Mama has been my mother. And when she died, papa became my father and my mother. Mama? You never even met her. So how is she your mother? She died before she gave birth to me. Ihunaya, you're actually smarter than that. If she died before she gave birth to you, how then were you born? I meant to say, she died during... birth. Who told you that? Papa? No, all I know is that, if you're my mother, you'd have a better attitude. Ihunaya, I really am your mother. And... that man is not your father. But he said he is. He's not. Why will he just show up and say, "I'm your father." And he's not my father. And why should I even trust you? All you keep telling me is lies upon lies. Ihunaya, I've never lied to you. Okay, please. That man is a criminal. He's been in prison for years. Then who is my father? His name is Fidelis. Ah, wake up. You're awake. Babe, I've fetched water for you. Go and take your bath before those neighbors wake up. You don't want to go to the toilet because. I've messed it up Eh! What are you doing? I'm leaving. What's going on? Did something happened in the village? I can't do this relationship anymore. - Why? - I just can't continue anymore. Don't say that, come on. You know I'll do anything for you. Anything that you want, I'll do it. That's the thing. You can't do something for yourself but you want to do for me. Are you joking? Look around you. This is poverty. I'm tired of suffering. I'm tired of struggling. Am I cursed? I need to make something out of my life. I... I need to make something out of my future. I... I need to get money I want to be wealthy. I can't continue like this. I cannot be with a man who has no money and no future. I can't. Oluchi please. Oluchi. - Oluchi. Oluchi please. - Stop. - Oluchi. - Leave me alone. Oluchi, don't do this. Please can you open your boot? Oluchi don't do this. I love you. Come on, don't do this. There is no future for both of us. Just leave me alone. Oluchi! Eh eh. Bros, please don't touch the bag. Come on, give me this bag. - What bag? - This is my girlfriend's bag. And your girlfriend put the bag in my car. Drop the bag. Can't you see she's coming from my house? Leave the bag alone. Your house? Is this a house or mud? Drop the bag, stop it. I'm warning you. - Leave my girlfriend's bag. - What's this rubbish? Is this not your stupid cab driver that is arguing with me. What? - He thinks I'm your driver. - Oluchi. - Wait... he thinks I'm your driver. - Stop. He thinks I'm your driver. Do I look like a taxi driver? Baby is this... No, please lets just go. Boss, excuse us. Get a job and make some money. Oluchi. Do you think a lady like this was created to suffer with you? Look at the mud house. Get a job. If you come close to my car, I'll hit you. I'm not okay. Oluchi. The only kind of place beauty queens such as yourself are meant to walk in and out of. I'll make you even love it more. - You see all this? - Yes. Belongs to you now. House keys. Oh my God! - You like it? - I love it. I love it. Now you're in the mansion. - All this for me? - Mm-hmm. And more to come. Please. What's the special occasion? Look at you. Silly girl. Do you want to know? I'll tell you. I'll tell you what I found, in the bathroom. This. Is it what I think it is? I didn't know how you're going to react. React how? I... I don't want you to think that I want to use this to track you down in this relationship. Are joking Oluchi? This is what my mother has been waiting for. Huh? Look, see, this is the best news ever. Who is it? Who is there? FCC. Open the door. FCC? - Good evening madam. - Good evening. We are here to search this premises and to confiscate this property. Where is your husband? My husband? What happened? ‪Where is your husband? Bankole! - What have I done? - Handcuff her. Keep quiet. Take him out! People, come -My eagle egg has landed -Prepare to welcome her Welcome. - She's a baby girl? - Yes sir. Thank you God. Thank you, Creator of the worlds. You're welcome. I name you "Ihunaya" There's no point naming her. I am full of joy. "Ihunaya" You're welcome. What are you doing? Packing. I'm going to Lagos. I see. And... Where is Ihunaya? I said I'm packing, I'm going to Lagos. I heard you. When you want to go to Lagos, journey mercies. But my question is, "Where is Ihunaya?" I don't know. What do you mean you don't know? I don't know. I don't know where she is. You didn't leave her in my care. Look, Oluchi. It's like that thing you smoke has given you a permanent scar in your brain. Where is my child? She's not your child. And I don't know where she is. Oluchi. What have you done with my baby? What have you done with my baby? She's not yours and it's none of your business. Am I... Look, let me tell you, I'm not joking with you. Pray, that the next thing that comes out from your mouth will be the where-about of Ihunaya. If not, I swear to God Who made us, I will deal with you. - So, where is she? - It's not your business. Where is she? That's what I asked. Where is she? - You cannot.. - You think I'm joking? You think I'm joking. Where is Ihunaya? Where is my baby? Have you gone mad? Where is she? I've used the belt, I'm going to punch you. Where is my baby? - Ah. - Thank you very much. You're welcome sir. You're very welcome. My baby. My baby. - God will continue to bless you. - Amen. Thank you very much. God bless you too. Thank you sir. My Ihunaya. You're welcome. My baby. Why won't this girl close the door? Ihunaya. Ihunaya. Ihunaya. Have you seen Ihunaya? She's inside my nose. - I knew you'll give me a stupid answer. - Idiot. -You're looking for Ihunaya -Your father. ‪-You're dressed like this. ‪-Your father. Devil. Your father is the prostitute. Ihunaya. Ihunaya. Oluchi good morning. What is it? Have you seen Ihunaya? No. - When was the last time you saw her? - Um, Last night. We came in together and... And what? Bishop, I think she left. Left? - To where? How? - I don't know. - Does she knows her way around Lagos? - I don't know. - I don't know what to do. - Okay, let me get my shirt. I don't quite understand. I'm sorry, but how did she get here? Well, she said she took your money. And then. Got one aunty, Aunty Purity... Charity. Aunty Charity. To take her to the bus station. And help her get a ticket. Where is she now? She's in school. Which school? Secondary school of course. Which secondary school, how did she get there? She took the entrance examination. She passed. She was selected. And she's there now. What kind of questioning is this? Wait, let me understand you... So, who paid for her school? Listen, I think it's best I take you to see her school teacher. When you get there, you can kill him with your questions. Consume him with questions. Not me. Aunty please let's go. Before your father died, I told him of a scholarship opportunity for Ihunaya's secondary school. I went ahead and paid for the entrance examination. But he did not have enough money to pay me back. So, I took half of the fees from him. Ihunaya sat for the examination and she passed. They gave her 250,000 naira cash prize. And that is beside the scholarship. They admitted her into the secondary school and from what I heard, she's doing really well. Did you hear that? Our Ihunaya is going to do great things. - Eh. - Oh. Did I mention that they gave her 250,000 naira? Can I please get the details of the school? Please. Yes sure. But if you have to visit her, you'll have to wait till the next visiting day. I don't have that time, I need to go now. - You cannot badge into a school when... - Wait. I don't understand. I cannot see who? Teacher Pius, that's my daughter. I gave birth to her. - Aargh! - Ah! Really? Now you gave birth to her. "I gave birth to her." Well... I will see what I can do. I'll call the principal of the school and ask for a favor. Thank you, teacher Pius. But I'm not promising you anything. Humphrey, wherever you are, God bless you. And you, did you know? That that money your father gave to teacher Pius For Ihunaya's exam, scholarship exam. That it was meant for drugs for his high blood pressure. Did you know? How did you know that? Because I loaned it to him, that's how. Well he didn't tell me. And how would he have done that? When you were not even picking up your calls He could have texted me. - Really? - Mm-hmm. Text you to say that he's dying of high blood pressure? When all the text messages he sent you about paying your little girl's school fees went unanswered. ‪He... didn't have to use his money - for his health to pay her school fees. - Shut your mouth, little child. Can you hear what is coming out of your mouth? That a man who has the option of securing the future for his daughter will now think of himself first. I can't imagine how stupid you are. He should have told me. And what would you have done about it? Paid for the treatment? I would... I would have done something. Like what? You? That would never come to visit. You, that never picked up the phone to call. What exactly would you have done? Please leave the way. "I would have done something." God works in mysterious ways. He communicates with people in different ways. Even sent messages in different ways. Through visions, through dreams, through interactions with people, relations, friends, and even foes. It depends on you to identify your message, decode it, and move on in life. For those of you who mistake it. You'll waste your time. And it will be dark. The world does not wait for any man, any woman. Make haste. Tired of it all Can't risk anymore Feeling all the emptiness as it comes Can't take it no more Sick of all the trial Don't want it no more I've decided to give it all to you ‪Can't take care of it all Oh oh oh Now I've been trapped in the dark I've been here for so long So, I'm trusting you Lord come and fix it all I don't wanna to go back I'm done with that life it's behind me Oh oh oh oh Now more than they see in the world I choose you Covenant keeper, destiny changer Righteous ruler I choose you with all that I am I surrender Lord here I am You never take me this far Just to leave me alone -Alone -Alone -Not your way, not your way -Not your way, not your way -Alone -Alone -Not your way, not your way -Not your way, not your way -Alone -Alone -Not your way, not your way -Not your way, not your way -Alone -Alone -Not your way, not your way -Not your way, not your way I must confess, I wouldn't have agreed for this to happen if it was anyone other than teacher Pius who made the request. I understand ma'am. But seeing you here, I'm happy. That he requested and I agreed. - Good morning. - Morning dear. Ah, teacher Pius tells me that your father raised Ihunaya all by himself and that he passed away recently. Yes ma'am. Ah, your father was a good man. Very good man. You know my father? Not exactly, but... I think, I know that I only met him once. I mean, I didn't even know who Ihunaya was until you showed up. Good morning. I don't quite follow. You don't remember me, do you? No, I... It's okay, come on. You can see her now. Hello, Ihunaya. Hello. There's someone here to see you. I don't know who she is. But... she said she knows who you are. I don't know who she is. She's lying. Ihunaya. I'll give you two a moment to talk this through. I'll be waiting outside. Okay? Behave yourself. Thank you. - Ihunaya. - Don't touch me. It's fine. I just err... I just want to talk to you. There's nothing you have to say to me and there's nothing I have to say to you. Because all you've been telling me is lies upon lies. You even sold papa and mama's wedding ring. Yes, Aunty Nwaka told me that she gave it to you. Ihunaya, I'm sorry about everything. I'm sorry I lied. I'm sorry I sold the rings. I'm sorry I couldn't be the mother that you deserve. I'm just so happy the way you've turned out. Even better than I could ever be. I'm sure papa will be so proud. Ihunaya, I er... Please... Please know that I'm always here and available for you. Please know that I'm ready. I'm ready to be the mother that you deserve. I just need you to let me in whenever you're ready. Please. I'm willing to do anything, and everything in my power to be the mother that you deserve. I beg. I love you. Ihunaya... I love you so much. And I'm such a fool for just... for just realizing this. I'm... I'm here for you whenever you need me. And even if you don't believe this, I love you very much. - Sandra! - Ma! Sandra, please come and take the kids upstairs. Go upstairs, okay? Go upstairs with aunty Sandra. I'll come and meet you later. - Oh, do come in. Come in please. - Sorry. What is this about? Please, I really would like to talk to him in private. Okay. Em, hello dear, there's someone downstairs who... She's saying she really needs to talk to you. You know what, just hold on. Em, sorry, this information, how important is it? Very important. I actually wouldn't be here if it wasn't. Babe, just come downstairs and attend to her please. I know. Okay for my sake. Thank you. He'll be joining us. Take a seat. What do I get you? No ma'am. - I'm fine. I'd rather even stand. - No. My husband won't be happy if he comes down to see you standing. I'll be fine. Say what you've have to say, I have things to do. Okay. I have... You have... We have um... I have a daughter for you. You have a daughter for me? Yes. Is that all? - Yes. - Good. Now leave. No, no. Hold on. Did you just say you have a daughter? - For my husband? - Honey. - Don't dignify this nonsense. - How? I swear to God, Fidelis. I'm telling the truth. Who gave you the permission to call me by my first name? I haven't seen you in ten years. The other night you saw me at the club bar, you track me here, to come and tell me this nonsense. I left you when I found out that I was pregnant I shouldn't have done that, but I did. This isn't even about me. This is about your child. - I find that very hard to believe. - You don't need to believe me, Fidelis, you don't. But... Ihunaya deserves to know her biological father. And you deserve to know about your daughter's existence. Ihunaya. That's her name? Yes. Ihunaya is an intelligent student. Just like you. She's also very witty. I know she got that from you and my father. Of cause she sings like a nightingale. I think she got that from me. She's, She's also a very, very smart student. - And she just got scholarship to go to... - Shut up. And leave my house. Fidelis just... I'm really sorry. For all the pain that I've ever caused you. And I'm sorry ma'am for... bringing this into your home. - But I really don't have any other choice. - I said get out of my house. - Fidelis would you behave... - Get out. I'm sorry. Babe. This guy's skit is so funny. This guy is a fool. This idiot. - Charity. - Yes. Oluchi. Oh my Please don't mess with me I look cute But I came from the trenches Don't test me, guy I'm cranky upstairs Oluchi, what the fuck?! She helped Ihunaya to the East by herself! I listened to your daughter because she said she wanted to go back to the village to resume school. You have no right. It was her choice. You're not her mother. And so what? Are you a mother? What do you mean and so? - Be thankful nothing happened to her. - What do you mean and so? Why would you do that without telling the mother or even me? Didn't I tell you that I'll get back at you. I'm getting mad and if I come through You'll know what's up Put you in a difficult situation Put you in a difficult situation Put you in a difficult situation If I catch you I'll put you in a difficult situation What if something happened to the child? Nothing happened to the child. So shut up! You know what? Forget. Idiot. Oluchi, please. - Get out. - You're begging her. - She should be thankful. - Please. I swear, because if something had happened to her. - If something happened... - Please. You're begging her! She injured me and you're still begging this fool. I should have way-billed your daughter to the grave. - You're senseless. - Hm. Idiot! I told you I'll get back at you, didn't I? Fool. Why are you running? Fool! Why are you running? Coward. Can you care for a child? You don't even know when she left. Fool. - Charity. - What? By morning... She should leave. Pack everything that is yours in this house. - Ehn? - To the minutest of... and leave. You and I... - are done. - Donatus! I'm not going anywhere. You told me you'd love me forever. I'm not going anywhere. Why will you tell me to leave? For who? For that girl? See, I'm not going... Bishop. Ihunaya, this is Mr. Fidelis Nwankwo. And, - that is doctor Akinwande. - Doctor Akinwande. They came all the way from Lagos to see you. Good morning Ihunaya. - Good morning. - How are you? I'm fine. There's no easy way to say this, so I'm going to go straight to the point. I think I'm your father. I'm sorry that I'm just showing up. But I found out you existed only three days ago. And how sure are you that you're my father? Honestly, I'm not. The only reason why I think that is because your mother showed up at my house three days ago. Wait... Do you have money? - Do I have what? - Money. Well... I like to think that I have some. That's it. Aunty Oluchi needs money and she can say whatever she wants to get it. Mr. Fidelis, don't listen to her. No, it's fine. I like her. Um, Ihunaya, here is the thing. There is a way for us to be sure if I'm your father or not. And how's that? It's called a DNA test. What does a DNA test stand for? Deo... Ihunaya, I will personally google the spelling and the meaning for you, okay? Let's just not keep this gentlemen waiting they have a flight to catch. Actually, it's okay. Mr. Fidelis she needs to get back to prep. Oh yeah, that's true. Ihunaya. I want to do this paternity test. But only if you're interested. And what if I say I'm not interested? Doctor, does it involved injection? No, there are no syringes involved. But I will have to swab your cheek, um, with this. - That's all? - Yes. That's all? Well, we'd have to take it to the lab for a test. But first, all we need right now is your cheek swab. Aunty Nwaka, what do you think? Well... Only if you want to. Hmm? But I think Oluchi would like you to take the test. I don't care what she thinks. Is it okay? Even I would like to know if this man, is really your father. Okay Let's do this so that everybody can go back to their normal lives. Okay, can you step forward please? Open your mouth. Where are you? Where are you? We've come too far For me to lose you this way Always believed That I can do better by myself But now I realize -With you I can do better -Do better Come back to me Where are you? Where are you? Where are you? Where are you? Where are you? Where are you? What does this mean? It means, Ihunaya... that... I'm your biological father. Wait. But I cannot accept you as my child. Not just yet. Am I your child or not? The paternity test says you are. But I have a family of my own. I don't just see how you can fit in with us. - Are you rejecting me? - No, I'm not. It's just... I'm going to pay your school fees. I'm going to put you through university. Up until you can stand on your own feet. I don't need a sponsor. I want a father. I'm sorry, Ihunaya. You shouldn't have bothered coming. You sent for me. I took the liberty of, carrying out a paternity test on the child you claimed is mine. I don't need to look at that. I know whose child it is. Oluchi, I'm happily married... with two kids. I cannot accept Ihunaya without affecting my marriage. - But she's your child. - I didn't raise her. You stole her from me. You stole me from her. I need you to understand, that because of your actions, I'm forced to make the most painful decision of my life. You're making a mistake. I know. But it's either that, or I destroy my marriage. And I have no intensions of destroying my marriage. You've done enough damage in my life already. Take this... Use it, to raise my daughter. I came to ask for forgiveness. Guys, I understand that you're all angry at me. And it's very justified. Oluchi, - you stole from us. - Yes! - Judas! - I shouldn't have done so. But I did it. That's why I'm here to apologize. I'm sorry. This is the money that... No! Wait. - Wait what? - Wait. Let her finish. Finish what? Guys, this is not about money. This is about trust. Oluchi, we trusted you, but you betrayed our trust. I was scared. Of what? Of... I was scared of failing. I was scared of being poor. I abandoned my papa. I abandoned my own child. For this... For this money. And the small family I have in Lagos... I still abandoned you guys, and cheated. That's why I'm here today to apologize. I'm sorry. Please forgive me. Please. How much is there? Eight Hundred Thousand. What is this? Let me help her hold it. Aunty, good evening ma. Good evening, Oluchi. I was not expecting you here. I'll leave the two of you. Thank you ma. How are you? I'm fine. You have... no idea how much I miss you. Ihunaya please. Please. Let me be your mother. Please. Do you know how to be a mother? I don't but... I can try. I miss you too. I know where you are I know where to find you ‪Oh oh oh all the point is that ‪It's the person who'll fix me I'll call... You're looking great. Oluchi I have good news for you. You remember that your song? I shared it with one of my friends. He's one of the biggest artist managers in the country. So, he said one of his artistes likes that song. And he wants you guys to have a collaboration That's really a good news. But... I can't. You know I'm not the only one who recorded the song. It was with my band. And we've parted ways. And it was my fault. But don't you think this is also an opportunity for them. Because it's a big one. I'm not sure they'd want to listen to me. They're not really happy with me. So... Why not ask them yourself? Okay, talk to them. I'm here with them. Oluchi. E Piano. How are you doing? So, Oluchi. We'd love to do the song with you. Always by my side Obara'm Oh oh oh oh Always by my side oh oh oh oh -Always by my side Obara'm -Always on my mind... Cut. Thank you so much, Waje, for doing this with us. You're welcome. I heard she's your baby sister. She's my baby. Wow... - She's going places. - Amen. I'm thinking we should work together again if you're open to the idea. It would be our absolute pleasure. Oh great. Mine too. Let's do it now before she overtakes the industry - Thank you so much sis. - You're welcome. - Thank you. - We're going to be on our way now. - Alright. - Take care. Ihunaya, come on. Mommy, please where is my Tab? It's in the bag. Did you just called me mommy? - No, I didn't. - Yes, you did. - No I didn't. - You just called me mommy. Oluchi. - How are you? - How are you? What's happening there? Chill. - We are here grooving. - Grooving! - Make sure you don't finish the money. - Don't worry. ‪Subtitle translation by: Regina Njoku
