But everything will be fine, boy! Don't get nervous. Keep calm. Take it easy. - Hey! What do I do with this bird? - What you want. Ah! What I want! Don't trust your manager?

But you may have heard that our birdman is suffering from a ... ailment. - I saw the body go by. - Yes. He lacked confidence. An amateur. While you ... space, you know it. Oh, Yes! - I knew you were interested! - Rocket man, yes. Birdman, no. - He doesn't want to know. - I understand. Cowards! All cowards! - It's easy to say. - Yet, with my new system there is no longer any risk. Believe me. You will no longer find a single imbecile gambling his life with your inventions. - Yes !

Do not leave me alone! Let me down! No, Mr. Director. I don't want to be a birdman anymore. - But you can't give up like that, all of a sudden. - No, I don't want to anymore. - Did you do all the exercises? - Yes, I've done them all. All. But the pulley? Didn't you do it? Let's talk about the pulley. I've been hung up for over an hour. An hour hung! An hour hung! Yes, but you can't fly like that on the first try. Do you understand? Training is always difficult in the beginning. No, Mr. Director. I don't want to train anymore. I've had it up to here with wings! Come on, take them off! Take them off! Take off my wings! - Remove, remove ... - Take them off! - It's easy to say! If he has managed to put them on, he must know how to take them off. That in my new system the assembly of the wings is final. It is not possible ... - Can I come in? - Mimi, come and see some. Mimi, how do you find him with his wings? They suit him very well. So will you work with us? No, he doesn't want to stay with us. He wants to leave. It is a pity. - But I didn't say I wanted to leave. - But yes! I didn't say I really wanted to leave. Maybe it will stay. - So, are you flying now? - Yes, I fly. I fly a lot ... I do short flights. - Let me see. - I flew a lot this morning and my wings are tired. - For me, to make me happy. - No, I prefer not to. - Don't you want to make me happy? - Yes, yes, yes ... I want to make you happy. I don't ask for better. Then let me see. I look at you. You wanted it, huh. - Good boy! - I flew! I flew! It was a gift for you. - A beautiful watch. - I'm very sorry. Me too. Ah, you! I'm already starting to get tired of you. But no, my friend! You made a mess! Mimi! Come come! Come on a second, quick! Fix his dress because it doesn't fit at all. We never find two of the same size. Done. Come on, my boys. - This cuff is missing. - Here we go! This other one, please. - And the sequins on the neck ... - No, no! I'll do it! - Done. It will be a triumph! - Sure? Maybe it will be more fun than we think. - Oh you! That's enough! - That's enough! So ... come on, come on! Go ahead... - Aren't you afraid of dogs? - No, I'm not afraid of dogs. Bravo, you are brave ... - I like animals. - Ah, you like animals. - I like little dogs. - Ah, you like puppies. Well, I have a surprise for you. Come here, Moco! - a delightful puppy. - Yes? - Very beautiful. Come, come here. Look at this guy. Nice, huh? Ah, yes, it's beautiful. - See you later. - Are you going away? Yes, don't worry. I have to go. Hey, hey! A kennel! Warning! A kennel! But it's bad! You don't have to bite! Be good. Well, now keep it, keep it close to you. - You're not saved! - Come on, I'm going up! Go away! No! Here is the dog! Ouch! Leave me! Leave me! Ah no! My pants, no! Oh, an angel! I'm not an angel, me. And if you weren't an angel, what would you be? Well, I would be ... I don't know what I would be. - It'll be ridiculous with that. - But no, it will be a lot of fun. - Ah no, you can't watch. - Well, I'm counting to ten. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten. - You have done? - Yes ... I did, but ... I don't have the courage to show myself. How beautiful you are! Really? I'm fine with it? Look at yourself in the mirror. Yes, that's true. You look like an angel. How you will impress! - Something wrong, sister? - Yes, sister. Everything is alright. - Are you upset, sister? - No, sister. - Oh my God! - An angel! - Hey, sisters! Do you have visions? - Excuse us! - We are empty. Ehi you! - Ah, it's you. - Yes. Can I come in? Duties? I was in heaven. - Liar! - I have proof here with me. - Tell me, what is the proof? - A surprise. - Good morning! - Good morning! - Look what I bring you. - Thanks. It's beautiful, huh? - it's great. - Yes, he was the greatest. Do you like? Thanks. I really like. You don't know how happy I am. I wanted to tell you a long time ago. One day I will have my circus. A great circus, you will see. He'll need a horsewoman. There is always a need for it in life. You are so cute on horseback! I always dream with you. I think about you all the time. But I don't dare tell you. I feel like a child in front of you. So, if you wanted ... What's happening? - What are you doing here? - I... And that ringtone? What is it? What is that ringtone? This! Huh? What is this? Huh? What is it? a surprise. A surprise, a surprise, a surprise, a surprise! Look what I do with your surprise! Take! I've been looking for you everywhere. Duties? I was sad. My little watch was so beautiful ... You don't have to be sad. You will go and look for others. He will bring them to you from heaven. - From the sky? - Yes, from heaven. Or from anywhere else, you know. I always get by, me. The more I think about it, the more I think about it ... the more I become convinced that it was you who made that beautiful alarm clock disappear. It's my mother who gave me that alarm clock. You hate mother. Listen. I'm fishing, so you understand? Your mother, your mother ... Ah, do you confess? Are you kidding us! The only thing that matters to you is fishing. Listen. We reason. You cared about that alarm clock of your mother, and I wanted to be awakened. So far we are in agreement. - But the alarm clock is gone. - Yes. And I'm the one most annoyed. We've been here for two hours and I haven't caught anything. And don't bite! They will never bite! Help! Help! Help! Help! Help! Help! Thanks! It doesn't work anymore. He will have it fixed. Is this paradise? - If you weren't there, I'd think I'm in my house. - Yes. But here is a watchmaker's paradise. You have a repair to do. - So you continue? - At full speed. Always fixing clocks and alarms? It is not really worth committing suicide. Yes, but this time, my son, it is in joy and for eternity. Is it because of her? Yes. She is beautiful. She's very beautiful. What's your name? Marie-Noelle. I'll try to settle the matter. What happened? - It's his father. - His father? He didn't want us to get married. And as long as you have this mentality, you will stay here! What have I done? What will become of me? I am so unhappy! My God, have mercy on me! Help me! Above all, don't be afraid. I'm not afraid. Ah, why does it seem natural to you? I come through the window and ... - Of course not. Yet ... - Yet what? - Well, I've been waiting for you. - Myself? Yes, you or another. Do you see angels from time to time? No, but one came when I was 4. As it was at night, they said I was dreaming. No, no and no! Do not give up! It's Father. She will marry whoever I want! - What are you doing? - Anyway, we can't let this girl starve. But are you sure you can? Yes, absolutely sure. - Will I be able to marry the man I love? - Yes. - Do you know angels? - Yes. - They can't refuse anything to the girls who kiss them. Good. - Then take me away now. - From where? - From the window, in your arms. - Ah no, I can't do that. - Why? prohibited? - But no, it's the weight. - Am I too fat? - Ah, no! I did not want to say this. - You're lovely. - Thanks. Can you imagine it? With a watchmaker! - You should like it. - Oh, I like it! I would like to be an angel and fly like this, in heaven. No? Yes. Yes. It has its positive side. - Sometimes it's worth it. - Yes, yes ... Oh! My boyfriend! But I am an angel. Does not matter. Ah well... What is this masquerade? - Dad, you can see that he is an angel. - Yes, I'm an angel! Sir, will you tell me what you are doing in my daughter's bed disguised as a bird? - I'll tell you. Well, I'm ... - Yes, come on! - An intermediary. - No explanations! - I'll settle the score with this guy! - Dad! - Speak like this to an envoy of the good Lord! - Idiot! - But Charles! - You shut up! You see? With your religious upbringing! Here's what happens! Do you want to tell me how it got in here? Well, I've been ... I've been through ... - From the window! - Yes, from the window.
