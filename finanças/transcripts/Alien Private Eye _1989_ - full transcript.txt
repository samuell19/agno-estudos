(thunderous drumming) (traffic whirring) - Uh! - All right, all right. Where's the other half? (dramatic music) - Get away from me! - Give it to us. Or we'll kill you. - Who are you? Let go of me! - Yo! Let her go. Let her go now.

(gun firing) (table shatters) (gun firing) (bullet ricocheting) (suspenseful music) Tell me who you are, asshole! Talk! (suspenseful music) - Kilgore sent me. - What does he want? - He wants the disc. - What disc? - Ask the girl. (suspenseful music) - Mess with me again, pal, and you're history. (soft rock music) I feel great. - (Rene) How can you say that when we've just been shot at? - Where I come from, this stuffs a piece of cake. - Oh? Where's that? - France. (Rene scoffs) Listen, before we do the story of my life, don't you think it's about time for you to come clean with me? Who are these guys? What do they want from you? - I'll tell you... but not until I trust you better. - You're so beautiful. (soft rock music) - (moaning) Lemro, you're so good. Take that stupid hat off. (Rene gasps) (dramatic music) (soft rock music) (Rene moaning) (Rene groaning) - That was great. - I've never felt anything like that before. (soft rock music) What are you? - An alien. - That's obvious. - What, are you prejudice or something? - No. - Suppose I was an alien and Jewish. How'd you like that? - It has nothing to do with that. - Suppose I was an alien and black. How'd that be? (Rene scoffs) (wind whistling) - I don't ever wanna see you again! (knock on door) - Dude. What was that all about? - I told her I was an alien. - Yo, dude. I told you never to do that. - She saw my ears. - Why don't you get those things clipped, dude? - Yeah, right. Then when I go back to my own planet, all the people there will think I'm an asshole. - You're never going back, dude. Stay here. - I'm going back. - Oh, yeah, right. When? - I don't know, but I'm going back. (soft dramatic music) (Lemro chuckles) (intercom buzzes) - There's a woman here to see you. - Send her in, Suzy. Rene! I knew you'd be back. (dramatic music) - Call me Electra. - What can I do for you? - You can find something for me. - Have a seat. - I prefer to stand. (traffic whirring) - Tell me about it. - It's an artifact of an ancient Egyptian civilization. The secrets it contains are of the utmost importance to our understanding of the development of Western culture. - What does it look like? - It's a perfect circle about this big. It's black; jet black, with silver inscriptions written out on both sides. (dramatic music) - How did you lose it? - It was stolen from me. - When? - The day before yesterday. - Where? - In my hotel room. Someone obviously knew I had it. I was bringing it to New York. I was going to meet with the Museum of Natural History. These men broke into my room and took it from me. - What did they look like? - They wore masks. I don't know what their faces were like. May I have a drink? - White wine? - Scotch and soda. But one of them had a skull and cross bone set in gold in one of his front teeth. - Some trees grow up twisted. - Can you help me? - I can. - May I ask you a personal question? - Go ahead. - Do you like Earth women? (moody music) I've been away from home a long time. I've been getting very lonely. - You're very beautiful. Your snicks are very solid. - Thank you. (soft dramatic music) - How did you hear about me? - You've got a rep. - Here? - Not here, at home on Styx. - Why did you come to Earth? - To bring the disc back to its rightful owners. - How did you get a hold of it? - Don't ask me so many questions. - How did you find -- - Lemro, look. That man. He's been following me, Lemro. I'm afraid of him. I think he wants to kill me. - Why? - He's coming up here to talk to you, I'm sure of it. - Who is he? (door closes) - It's him! He mustn't see me! Let me hide in the closet. - Forget about it. (intercom buzzes) - Quick! - Be my guest. (suspenseful music) - (Suzy) Lemro? - What is it, Suzy? - There's another, uh... - I believe there's a man there who wishes to see me. - Well, that's right, boss. - What's his name? - What's your name? - Scama. - (Suzy) The man says his name is Scama. - Send him in. (ominous music) - Mr. Lemro, private investigator, I presume? - That's right. - I am here to see you on a matter of urgent business. A matter of the utmost importance. The fate of the Earth will not be unaffected by the outcome of the matter about which I wish to speak to you. Mind if I smoke? - No, go right ahead. - Perhaps... (match strikes) You are not unaware of a struggle which is occurring now between the lowest elements of organized crime in this city. - What kind of struggle? - A struggle for control, for control of the most deadly kind of force known to man. - Like what? - Like a thermonuclear device! (dramatic music) - I'm intrigued. - I am not joking, you understand? - And how did a bunch of cheap hoods get their hands on an A-bomb? - By chance. - Tell me what it looks like. - It's black; jet black, in the shape of a disc. - Let me guess, with silver inscriptions written out on both sides? - How did you know? - Why is everybody after that goddamn disc? - How dare you speak to me that way. - Let me see your ear! - Oh! - Doctor. Plastic surgery. - I will not submit to this uncivilized behavior! - So, you're from Styx. - And you know more than you're telling. I see you've already heard of the disc. And now, I begin to wonder if perhaps I was in error in feeling I might be able to trust you. (suspenseful music) If you will raise your hands, please. If you don't mind, I will search the premises. - You didn't finish telling me how it got here. - It fell here. It's not from Earth. It fell out the sky. And it was found. Found by the wrong people. If you care about Earth, if you care about the people here, if you care about our planet, about Styx, you will help me recover it. - And why should I believe that? - Because that's the truth. (suspenseful music) - Surprised about this? - So, Electra, we meet again. - Since you followed me here. - I am sure I don't know what you mean. - You have never thought to check up here on Earth? - Yeah, you will surely agree that our rivalry has always been to our mutual benefit. - What's he talking about? - Really, Mr. Lemro, this is none of your concern. - Thermonuclear device, Egyptian artifact. Who the hell are you guys? - Lemro, we need you. - What for? - Oh, really, Electra? You think it's actually necessary? - Come clean! Tell me the truth! - (sighs) I see no need to listen to these rude demands any further, do you? - No. - Good. So good to have met you. (door closes) - Find the disc, Lemro. I'll pay you a million quiplets for it. - A million quiplets? That's a lot of money on Styx. - I'll be in touch. (suspenseful music) (traffic whirring) - No tricks, or we'll blast you all to hell. - Did you bring the cash? - I brought it. - Then where is it? - Luger, show 'em the money. There it is. Three million in cash. Any other kind of a deal and I wouldn't do this kind of business with a dog like you. - You're slime, Hanson! - You young punks think you own the world. - If it wasn't for the fact that I needed the cash flow, I'd keep the disc and bury you with it once and for all. - Where is it? Where is the disc? - I only got half of it. - What? - Read my lips. - The deal is off. - Take half the disc. It's worth half the cash. - Yeah, you get the money and I get nothing. - You get half the disc! - Without the other half, this thing is worthless. How could you lose something like that? - How do I know you didn't steal it from me? (suspenseful music) - Easy, easy, easy. - Oh, God, ease this life. Don't you fire. - Eat lead and die! (guns firing) - Get back! (guns firing) - Buy the farm, Streak? (guns firing) - Guess again! (gun fires) - Uh! (guns firing) - That was a great idea of yours, Kilgore. (suspenseful music) (gun clicks) (gun fires) Huh! Uh! (panting) I taught you everything you know. - You taught me too much. Plant the dope. Leave $150,000. (dramatic music) (man gasps) (engine starting) Let the cops figure it out. Let's go. He was gonna sell it! - Not anymore. The disc is worth millions. - We're gonna buy all the police in this city. This is the answer. (Steve breathes heavily) (dog barking) - More of it. I need more of it. - Steve, you're my brother. You can tell me. You never did drugs. How could this have happened to you? - (breathes heavily) Me and my buddies were in this bar night before last. (customers chattering) We ran into some bad dudes. - Leave me alone! Get lost! Uh! - Come here. - Come on, baby. We're gonna show you a good time. - Get your hands off me. Uh! - We're gonna light your fire, baby. - Please. Leave me alone! - She just wants to be left alone. - She's too tense. - Man, guys like that like that just make me wanna kick ass! - Yeah, you and me both. - You need a man who knows how to make you relax. - Get away from me. - You're coming with us! - That does it for me! Come on! - All right. - Yeah, let's... (fists whack and thud) (men grunting) (table shattering) - Your turn! - Uh! - Come on! (fists thud and whack) (man groaning) I got a lot more for you! (fist thuds) - Uh! (body slams) - Don't go. - No! No! (fist whacks) (bottle shatters) (men grunting) (man choking) (dramatic music) - Uh! - Here you go, big boy. - Okay, go ahead, knock it off. (bottles clinking) - (gasping) No, no, no! - Come on. - No! (gasping) No! (gasping) No! Stop, no! (Steve groaning) - Oh, my God! Was it heroin? - Not heroin, not cocaine. (panting) Something awful. Something worse. I need it. I need more. More! (Steve breathes heavily) Then after they left, I found half of that black disc. They must have left it by accident after the fight. Oh, I'm going to have to shoot up again. I need to. I need it, Rene. (Steve gasping) - Steve! I'll help you. I swear, I'll do something to help. (knock on door) - Good evening. May I come in? - Sure. - What a lovely residence you have here. This kinda space would be very expensive at home. - They don't give it away here, either. Have a drink? - Is that really...? - Unearthly spirits, liquor from another galaxy. All the comforts of home. - Thank you. (Scama sighs) Oh, it seems so odd to be drinking it on such a strange planet. (wind whistling) I don't think I'll ever get used to these funny looking ears they have here. - Why'd you have the plastic surgery, then? - That's why I come to speak to you, Lemro. This is the case that could make my career at home. Everyone has heard of you. Your exploits are even more famous since you left, but I am, as yet, not so well known, but if I could just solve this case, if I could recover the disc... - What is it? - But I already told you. - Thermonuclear device? Cut me some slack. - It hurts me deeply, Mr. Lemro, that you should doubt my words. - Right, and Electra said it was an ancient Egyptian artifact! - Electra, Electra, Electra! She is always interfering in my cases! - Don't change the subject. - That woman will drive me crazy. She lies to you through her teeth, yet you believe her instead of me. - I don't believe either one of you! - But you must, Mr. Lemro. A terrible force is about to be unleashed on your world. And now, I must be going. I am sorry to find you so uncooperative. I had hoped that we'd be able to collaborate to our mutual benefit. And now! (elbow thuds) Uh! - Can't pull that shit with me! Didn't you ever have John Huston? (Scama groaning) (suspenseful music) - Oh, where am I? (Scama groaning) You're a very violent man. - Unhappy childhood. - Oh, I'm so sorry. Now, I really must be going. I hope you'll reconsider your decision. - Don't be so sure that I won't. I'm sure there's some truth to what you've told me. - Now, may I have my gun, please? - Why, sure. Don't even think about it. - No, perhaps that would be better. (Lemro chuckles) (suspenseful music) - Kilgore! - Yes! - (Crowd) Kilgore, Kilgore, Kilgore, Kilgore, Kilgore, Kilgore, Kilgore, Kilgore, Kilgore, Kilgore, Kilgore, Kilgore, Kilgore, Kilgore, Kilgore, Kilgore, Kilgore, Kilgore, Kilgore! - The first one is for me. What's in it? - Saltwater. - And the others? - Real thing. - Huh. Good man. - (Woman) Now who's gonna get it? (crowd chattering) - Oh! (inhales) Oh! Oh! Oh! - (Woman) Bastard. (crowd chattering) - T-Bone! (crowd chattering) You were flawless yesterday. - This one's for you. (dramatic music) (T-Bone gasping) (T-Bone groaning) - Delilah? Where's Delilah? - Oh, yeah. - Bring me Delilah! (crowd chattering) - (Man) Holy shit. - Soma! Kilgore, I deserve it, too. Give me some Soma. - Oh, you do, do you? - I killed 10. No, 20. No, 50 of Hanson's slimy weasels. - 50? - 50? (crowd laughing) - 50! - 50! - No, a hundred! - Oh, a hundred! A hundred! (crowd laughing) A hundred! - A hundred! - I said it was a hundred! And the first man who calls me a liar has to answer to this. That's right. My bare hands. - All right. Come over here. Get ready. (dramatic music) (man gasping) (man groaning) (man screaming) - Kilgore, me, me! Give me some Soma. - You? You pitiful wreck. Why should I give you anything? - Please, please, Kilgore! - Get away from me! - No! (sobbing) - Delilah? Where is she? Where's Delilah? - (Man) There she is. - Come here, my beauty. (dramatic music) - Uh! Why don't you let me go? - Let you go? Darlin', 'cause I love you. - You call hate love. - We have a love-hate relationship, darling. - All love-hate relationships are hate-hate relationships. - All right, then, I hate you! (hand whacks) (Delilah gasping) (intense music) What difference do you think it makes to me? (snaps fingers) Give me some Soma! - Oh! (gasping) - Give me another one! (Delilah gasping) - (Crowd) Kilgore, Kilgore, Kilgore, Kilgore, Kilgore, Kilgore, Kilgore, Kilgore, Kilgore, Kilgore, Kilgore, Kilgore, Kilgore, Kilgore, Kilgore, Kilgore, Kilgore, Kilgore, Kilgore! (soft rock music) (beer pouring) - Dude. Whoo. - Rob, how you doing, buddy? - Just raging, dude. - What are you drinking? - Cerveza, dude. Breakfast of champions. - One more. - So what's shaking, bro? - Man, are you ready for this? I think I'm in love. - No way! With an Earth woman? - Hey, not so loud. - Totally. Right on, dude. So who's your dream date? - Same girl I told you about over the phone. The one I met the day before yesterday. - The one you helped out of a jam, yeah? - That's her. I really think I'm in love, man. I really think I'm in love with her. - So lay on me her stats, dude. What's she like? - She's beautiful. Sharp. She's an interior decorator. She wears great clothes, she's got fabulous taste. - Yeah. And it's weird, but even though her and I are so totally different, I really think she understands me. - Whoa, take it slowly, bro. The last time I saw this chick, as I recall, she didn't look too stoked. Wasn't she the one I saw bailing from your pad the other night? - That's the thing. I might not even ever see her again. - Didn't she give you her number? - (chuckles) She gave me a lot more than that. - Yeah. - And she saw my ears. - Why didn't you get those things clipped, dude? - If that's what it takes to make her happy, I might do it. (brooding music) (knock on door) Rene. (wind whistling) I haven't been able to think of anything but you since you left. - Lemro, that's not why I'm here. I've decided to trust you. You're the only one I can turn to. My brother's been poisoned. He's been addicted to some kind of drug. He's sick, Lemro. He needs help. Remember those thugs who were attacking me the day we met? - What did they want? - They wanted this. (suspenseful music) - What is it? - I don't know. But they'll do anything to get it. - What are you doing with it? - Staying alive. My brother found it in bar after they beat him half to death and shot him full of poison. (Lemro sighs) - Here, let me see it. (wind whistling) (suspenseful music) It's Krell. - You recognize that writing? - You bet. - What is it? - You know the international "not allowed" sign? - You mean the red circle with the line through it? - That's it. - Well? - Well, this is like the cosmic version of that. There are seven or eight thousand planets where if they catch you owning anything marked like this, they kill you. - How'd it get to Earth? - It fell here. - Well, what is it? Why is it so bad? - I don't know yet. It's gotta be pretty serious. My planet's equivalent of the FBI is here looking for it and they're not talking. We'll have to see the other half of the disc to find out. - How are we gonna do that? - Not we. I'll handle these sons of bitches myself. You take care of yourself and your brother. - How will you find them? - You remember the fight in the disco? - I think so. - Before I turned that hairball loose, I put a bug on him. If I can get near him again, it'll lead me right to them. - Thank you. (suspenseful music) (wind whistling) Lemro, they're coming for me again soon. I can feel it. - My son, you must turn from these evil ways. - Bug off, father. - Look within yourself at the light that beckons you. It is God's light. The light of your eternal salvation. God can forgive the most heinous of sins. The most horrible crimes. It is not too late for you to turn from this path of evil. But stop, stop now before it is too late. (suspenseful music) - No, Kilgore, not the tooth! Not the priest! - Arr! (Kilgore spits) (skin hissing) (priest gasping) (priest screaming) How could you do it? How could you do it to a priest? Don't look at me that way. I know you've only got room in your mouth for one false tooth full of poison. I've been with you a long time, man. How could you do that to a priest? (suspenseful music) (gun fires) (dramatic music) (wind whistling) - Lemro. - What? You? - How nice to see you again. - What are you doing here? Who in the hell do you think you are? And why are you after this goddamn disc? - Forget about the disc, Lemro. Let's talk about us. (soft dramatic music) I miss the touch of a man from our world. - You remind me of home. How much I love it. Electra, I'm in love with another woman. An Earth woman. - Where is she? - Well, whether or not she's in love with me is still an open question. - In that case... - You promise never to come here like this again? - I promise. (soft dramatic music) (suspenseful music) (birds chirping) (traffic whirring) (suspenseful music) (gun fires) (dramatic music) - Oh! Lemro! (suspenseful music) (Scunge breathes heavily) - Don't try it, you asshole, or I'll blow her brains all over the floor! (gun fires) (Scunge groaning) - Do it! Do it! (Scunge breathes heavily) (dramatic music) (bushes rustling) Why didn't you do it? - Are you kidding? I'd have loved to, but I want him to lead me back to where they live. See, he's still wearing that same jacket. If he'd have left at home in the laundry, I would've nailed that son... (tires screeching) Is that your car? - Yeah. - Give me your keys! - Over there. - I'm out of here. Meet me at my place. Stay inside. Lock the doors and stay low. - Be careful. (intense music) (tires screeching) - He's moving pretty fast. Got to keep him in range. (Scunge panting) - Mmm! (Scunge groaning) - Coming in today, but it's coming in tomorrow. - No, he couldn't get it to us tomorrow. But we'll have to see what we can get done. - We got our assurance, man. - A couple of coke dealers face down in the river. You'll never see them again. - I went there. I got to her. I almost had her, but that guy from the disco, he shot off my ear. He shot off my ear! - Oh, yeah? So what? Get out of here! (suspenseful music) (knock on door) (wind whistling) - Any trouble? - Not yet. How'd it go? - I found it. I went and tracked him right back to where they live. I'm going back there tonight. - You sure it'll be safe? - Don't worry about me. Come on. Let's go out. (crickets chirping) (traffic whirring) - It's nice out. - Rene, I've got something I need to tell you about the day we met. - What is it? - I'm sorry I didn't tell you more about myself (sighs) Before we got involved. - Oh. Oh? - I'm really sorry, Rene. - It was a shock. You terrified me, Lemro. - I know. I'm really sorry. (soft rock music) I mean, I know you can't exactly look it up in, like, Emily Post, under the chapter "Aliens." When do you tell the girl? But you know, all the same, after you get involved, it's not the right time. - Not to mention during. - Right. Not to mention during. - It was fun, though. - I know. It was for me, too. - Wait a minute, Lemro. Slow down. I don't think I could ever be involved with an alien. - Just gimme some time, Rene. That's all I ask. - So Lemro, what brought you here? - You mean like to Bel Air? - No, I mean like to Earth. - What do you mean? Earth is fun city. - What? - I'm having a good time. I'm on vacation. Seeing new places, doing new things. - What are you a private eye for, anyway? - Lets me meet people and get to know them. I meet more people and get to know them better in a month then I'll bet you do in an entire year. - (chuckles) This is too much. - Cut it out. - Get serious here. - Come on. Let's go hear some jazz. (suspenseful music) (men chattering) (group chattering) (Kilgore spits) - Food! More food! (suspenseful music) (group chattering) (dramatic music) (suspenseful music) (dramatic music) (suspenseful music) - Man, could you believe how good that thing tastes? (suspenseful music) - You. - Oh! (foot whacks) (footsteps tapping) (fist whacks) - Uh! (foot whacks) - Uh! (dramatic music) (Lemro grunting) (dramatic music) - You're Kilgore. - You're dead. (men grunting) Hold. (Lemro gasping) I don't think this is enough for you. Well, you'll feel this. (Lemro groaning) Take him upstairs and lock him up. It won't be long before he'll do anything for another taste of Soma. (Lemro breathes heavily) (men grunting) (body whooshes) (foot whacks) - Uh! (fists whacking) Uh, uh! (fist thuds) Ya, ya! (foot whacks) Uh! (foot whacks) Yah! (fist thuds) Uh, yah! (body slams) (intense music) (plastic rustling) (foot thuds) Yah! Yah, yah, yah! (foot thuds and whacks) (engine stalls and starts) (tires screeching) (engine revving) (intense music) (tires screeching) (motorcycle buzzing) (tires screeching) (horn honking) (horn honking) (tires screeching) (cars banging) (engines revving) (tires screeching) (cars banging) (tires screeching) (cars banging) (car crashing) (motorcycle scraping) (tires screeching) (cars crash and explode) (intense music) (fire crackling) (Lemro breathes heavily) (Lemro groaning) (sirens wailing) (motorcycle buzzing) (Lemro grunting) (knock on door) (wind whistling) - Lemro! (Lemro breathes heavily) Are you all right? (Lemro groaning) (wind whistling) - Uh, uh! (suspenseful music) (Lemro sighing) (Lemro grunting) Oh. (wind whistling) (Lemro sighing) (Lemro grunting) (grinder buzzing) - Good morning. I'm making us some breakfast. (wind whistling) How are you feeling? - Great. - What happened to you last night? - How'd I get here? - (sighs) You just came in, passed out. Lemro, are you feeling okay? - Yes and no. You know that stuff they shot your brother up with? - Yes. - Well I got an armload full of it yesterday, too. - No, Lemro! Not you, too! - I didn't respect those guys enough. Tell me what the stuff does. - You mean what it did to Steven? - Yeah. - Do you really wanna know? - Yeah, I really wanna know. I have to know. - By tonight, you'll do anything for another hit. By tomorrow morning, you'll be nuts. - Nuts? - Nuts, crazy, insane. And if you don't shoot up again then, I don't know what'll happen next. - Great. Was I wearing a jacket when I came in last night? - Yes, over there. - Check this out. (dramatic music) - Lemro, you found it. - Yeah, I came out with the goods. Where's your half? - It's right here. - Let's see it. (suspenseful music) (disc clicks) Of course. It's part of a device that makes Soma. - What's Soma? - It's what me and your brother are pumped up with. - Well, okay, but what is it? - It's an alien designer drug. (dramatic music) - I've heard of designer drugs. That's when a scientist looks at a molecule of an illegal drug and moves an electron from here over to here. And it's still just as deadly as before, only now it's legal. - Right. You've already got drugs like that here on Earth. Imagine what kind of drugs they'll be able to make here in a thousand years. This drug was designed on my planet with 30th century technology. It's what you guys on Earth are headed for. Renegade scientists designed this to be the most addictive drug possible. Given human body chemistry, the body chemistry of life forms like us. It's been illegal on my planet for 10 centuries. - But how could anything be worse than, say, heroin or cocaine? - How could anything be worse? This is worst. First of all, doing this drug feels almost as good as having sex. - It's designed with 30th century technology and it doesn't feel better than having sex? - Nothing feels better than having sex. Okay. It feels great at first, then it leaves you alone for a day or so, then it hurts like hell until you do it again. You do this drug five times, you're hooked for life. You do it a couple hundred times, you die. You go cold turkey, you die. The only cure after five times is a 100% total blood transfusion, and only Keith Richards can afford that. - Lemro, are you telling me that you and my brother are gonna die? - How many times has he shot up? - Twice. - And they gave me a double dose. So we're about even. We're okay. We haven't shot up five times yet. (sighs) We can still kick it. We can still go cold turkey. - Lemro, I don't know if my brother has the strength. They keep sending him packages of the drug to taunt him. And I don't know if he has the strength to resist. - We'll give him the strength. - It's gonna hurt like hell. - And in three days... we'll be clean again. (group chattering) - Yes, yes, please! Just one more shot! (man gasping) - Get ready. - Uh, yeah. (gasping) (dramatic music) (man groaning) Thank you. Thank you! (groaning) (man screaming) - He's dead. - Some wimps can't handle it. Give me some Soma. (Kilgore breathes heavily) Delicious. - It didn't kill him. Shit. (group chattering) - Look, there's Delilah. (footsteps tapping) - (panting) Give me some. Give me some Soma. (gasping) (dramatic music) (Delilah gasping) - She doesn't have much longer. - She's all used up. - Get rid of her. How much Soma do we have left? - About a quart. - Quart? We gotta get the other half of that disc. You know how much it's worth to us? - Tell me. - The most addictive drug in history. Better than heroin. Better than cocaine. It'll make the heroin business look puny. The coke business bunk. It's worth billions. Wait here. (hand slams) Oh, what?! Ah! (papers rustling) (Kilgore grunts) Uh! Oh, Hitler, who art in Hell, help me find this disc! (Kilgore sighs) Scunge! Lemro's got the disc. He's got all of it. Find him and kill him! - Let's do it! (group chattering) - Does your brother live far from here? - Only about 15 minutes. How do you feel? (engine revving) - So far, so good. A little hot. - (Scama) You said he'd call. - He'll call. (crowd cheering on T.V.) (whistle blowing) (birds chirping) - Hi. - Hi, Steve. So good to see you. This is Lemro. - Rene told me a lot about you. She told me some things I found pretty hard to believe. - I told him about your ears. I told him you were from somewhere else. - Yeah, right. She told me where you're from. France. (laughs) Look, pal, I don't care where you're from. If you're a friend of Rene's, you're okay with me. - I'm going to the car, I'll be right back. - You play football, don't you? - That's right. - Look, that's me right now. - I've seen you play. You've got great hands. - Thanks. Not looking so great right now, though. - When was the last time you shot up? - Yesterday. - That's when they shot me up. - (sighs) I thought I was gonna die. I had to have another hit. - And that was your second time? - That's right. So you've only had one hit. - It was a double dose. We're about even. - You don't know what it's like when this stuff starts to twist itself around inside you. You feel like you'd rather taste it than live. - I'm not shooting up again. - (scoffs) That's easy for you to say now. Just wait 'til tonight. Wait 'til tomorrow morning. - You wait! I'm making up my mind now. I'm not gonna quit 'til I'm clean. - All right. Me neither. - Whatever it takes. - Whatever it takes. - We're gonna have to move to a hotel. They know where you live. This is the place. This is where it's going to happen. (Steve quivering) Stay with it, buddy. - I can handle it if you can. No goddamn alien's gonna out-macho me. (Steve quivering) I can't handle it! I can't handle it! It's driving me crazy! Oh! No, uh, uh! (fist pounding) - Lemro! (Steve groaning) - No, stop it! (Steve panting) - Thanks, I needed that. - It's still 104 degrees. And your temperature's no better. This is killing you both! - No way. We're going to make it. - You've gotta stop this before it kills you! - Lighten up. (birds chirping) -Mmm. - I feel good. - We made it. - We're gonna be okay. How you feeling? - Wonderful. I don't know if I could ever thank you enough, Rene. - I'm so glad you're well gain. - I'm going out for some air. You want anything? - Steve, can I ask you something? - You bet. - How do you like Lemro? - (sighs) If it wasn't for him, I don't think I'd be clean now. I guess I'd still be using that miserable drug. Maybe the real question is: how do you like him? - The first time I met him, I thought he was wonderful. And then I was furious at him. And now he's done so much for us. Don't you think so? - Yeah, I do. He has. - I mean, he got into all of this just for my sake. - Don't forget what he is, Rene. - I can't. - Okay. See you in a few. - Where's Steve? - Went out for some air. - I called some friends. They'll be here in an hour and a half. - You feel good now? - I feel wonderful. - Lemro? - Yes? - Is your planet very beautiful? - It's beyond anything you've ever imagined. - Do you miss it? - Very much. - Tell me what it's like. (soft synth music) - Silver grass, mountains 10 miles high, five moons, 10 suns. At night, the air is rich and sweet. You want to drink it more than breathe it. - Don't you have pollution like we do? - We whipped pollution 500 years ago. Our air is as clean as yours was when the dinosaurs breathed it. - Do you have oceans and ships? - Enormous oceans. My world is three times as big as Earth. And our oceans are enormous. Some of the fish that swim in them are intelligent and raise crops undersea that we trade with them for. And we have sailing ships with broad sails the size of a football field. - What's the name of it? - It's called Styx. - Lemro... I love you. Now we know what it is, tell us how it got here. - It fell here. Just like Scama told you. After they were outlawed 10 centuries ago, all but one of them was destroyed. - The last one resided in the Museum of Planetary History until last month. - It was stolen, but the robbery didn't go as smoothly as planned. When the thieves felt us closing in on them, they encased it in a rock-like substance and launched it into space. - It was on a trajectory that would've returned it to Styx in five years. - But instead, it entered an unchartered black hole, which flung it into an entirely unexpected region of the universe. - Your region. - It fell to Earth here two weeks ago. Only my discovery of the uncharted black hole permitted me, amongst the thousands of agents assigned to this case, to trace it to its destination. - Why didn't you tell us before? - It is forbidden. - Our orders were to do nothing that might enable anyone who found it to learn what it was and how to use it. - I think it's safe to assume they figured it out. (suspenseful music) Man, am I glad we're outta here. - Not outta the woods yet. - That's right. - Oh, what a night. - This is incredible. (engine revving) (guns firing) - This way! (guns firing) (guns firing) (guns firing) (intense music) (guns firing) - Steve, Rene, run for cover. I'll hold 'em here. (guns firing) - Oh! (Steve groaning) - Everybody hold your fire! Come here. Now give us the disc, or your friend gets it. - Oh, oh! - Don't do it, Rene! - Do it, Rene, or we'll blast that poor bastard brother of yours from here to hell. - No. - Steve. - Get your friend outta the street. - Lemro, forget about me! Stay where you are! - Now, switch 'em. (truck rumbling) (suspenseful music) (truck rumbling) - Say goodbye to your girlfriend, asshole! (gun firing) - Rene! (trunk slams) (engine starting) (tires screeching) - (Woman On Intercom) Dr. Davis, telephone, please. - Your friend Steve will be fine. It's a superficial leg wound. You can set your mind at ease. (intense music) (group chattering) (door opens) - Hey! (guns firing) - Hey, get down! Move it, move it! (Lemro screams) (guns firing) (laser gun firing) - Uh! (guns firing) (bullets ricocheting) (guns firing) (laser gun firing) (guns firing) (laser gun firing) (body thuds) (guns firing) (bullets ricocheting) - I'm gonna rape ya and then I'm gonna kill ya! (intense music) (guns firing) - Let me kill her. - No. - Let me kill her. - No. - I'm gonna kill her! - Uh! (Scunge gasping) (Scunge groaning) - You killed Scunge! (guns firing) - You two clean up here. Kilgore's mine. - Back off, Lemro, or the girl gets it. - Rene. (dramatic music) You're alive. - Get out of here, darling, run for your life! - Better listen to her, hero. - Oh, right. Touch one hair on her head and I swear to God, I'll blow your brains out. - Think you're so tough. I challenge you to a fair fight! Hand-to-hand, man-to-man, right here, right now. (suspenseful music) You got the guts for it, asshole? - Fuck you. I've been waiting for a chance to do this. (intense music) (foot whacks) (body thuds) (foot whooshes and whacks) (foot whacks) (foot thuds and whacks) (Lemro grunting) (suspenseful music) (fist whacking) (grunting) (both grunting) (fist whacking) (knee whacks) (both grunting) (fist whacks) (foot thudding) (fist whacks and thuds) - Uh, uh, uh! (intense music) (fist thuds) Uh! (Kilgore choking and groaning) (poison fizzing) (Kilgore gasping) - I didn't hit you that hard, buddy.
