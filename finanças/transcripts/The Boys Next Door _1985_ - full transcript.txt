(ominous orchestral music) - [Narrator] Nearly all these murderers are white males. Many of them handsome, charismatic, intelligent. They begin to kill in their 20s or early 30s. - [Man] He seemed like a regular kind of guy. Uh, you know, normal. Kind of quiet. But, uh, pretty smart. He, he just didn't seem like the kind of guy that would kill anyone, you know? I mean, it doesn't make any sense. - [Woman] They don't think that you're worth anything if you're in their way. You know, it's like, she was screaming, so I Killed her. - [Man] I didn't expect her to scream. I mean, I wasn't gonna rape her or take her money. I was only gonna Kill her. - [Man] These people confuse sex and aggression. They can't differentiate between the two. - [Woman] I just think we live in such a violent society. - [Man] Sometimes I'll be walking along the street, and just wonder, that all of a sudden, one of these crazy people might wantonly just murder you. It's frightening. - [Man] I just couldn't fit in anywhere. No matter how hard I tried. - [Man] The new criminals have been so brutalized in their own upbringing that they seem incapable of viewing their victims as fellow human beings. - [Man] We've got 35 or more people out there now Killing 20 and 30 people each. - [Man] Like, if I had a .38 now, I could make you do just about anything I wanted to. And just about all my life, people have been doing that to me. - [Woman] Back in the past, it didn't seem as real. And it was never one of those things that you thought could happen to you. - [Man] Society's had their chance. - [Man] He was a sour man. He had a bumper sticker that read, "I'm not deaf, I'm ignoring you." - [Woman] At age 15, he killed his grandparents. Just to see how it would feel. - [Man] I had nothing but pure hatred. If I wanted a victim, I'd just go get one. - [Man] I don't see how anybody can tell me that the fact that his mother used to force him to watch her, uh, turn tricks, uh, and threw him out of the house, and the way he was treated in his childhood, I'm sure that must have affected him. And quite a bit. It has to. - [Man] Yeah, well like TV. Where you stab someone and they just fall down and they're dead. - [Man] I think we're all expecting these killers to be frothing at the mouth maniacs. The scary thing is that seemingly normal people commit these crimes. They can act like anyone. Your friend. Your teacher. The guy next door. - [Man] Yes, but if they kill without conscience, how can they be treated then? How can we recognize them before it happens again? (ominous orchestral music) - How does it look? - Excellent. (all murmuring) - Looks like some guy broke his back. - [Kid] No, I heard he was hit by a school bus. - [Friend] So did I, Darren told me. - Here comes Patterson. Check him out. - He's gonna drop a load. (imitating fart noise) (all groaning) (laughing) (school bell ringing) - [Kid] Boring. (all murmuring) Boring. - I know that you think that teachers always say this, but you are my favorite class. I am gonna miss you. All of you. After the closing ceremonies tonight, I know I'm not gonna see you. And we are gonna break a little early today, but before we do, I just want to give you some advice, from a friend. Most of you are going to go on to college. You're gonna be the people who change the world. And believe me, the world is changing. I mean, for example, Betsy. Betsy, you're gonna major in computer science. Ed, Ed is gonna be an electrical engineer. And Todd, uh, uh, Todd, what were you again? - Modern dance. (all laughing) - [Kid] Hey, Tony. - You have got a unique opportunity to ride the crest of the third wave. Mr. Alston, have you got a comment? - Unlikely. (all laughing) - Now, I know. This sounds like a lecture to you. But my point is just this. That my dear mother was born when the Wright brothers flew. She died when Armstrong walked on the moon. And in those 66 years of change, she never once lost her humanity. Well, you remember humanity, don't you? We read about it in chapter three. - Humanity. What the fuck does he know about humanity? What does he know about anything? - He's been locked up in that room for 20 years. All he really wants is a couple good beaver shots. - [Girl] Hey David, do you need a ride? - Jesus. I'm glad we're getting out of here. - Yeah. We will never see Bonnie Roberts again. - [Roy] High school didn't teach me shit. - That's not true, Roy. Well, we did learn about VD and rubbers in social, anyway. - All right. One thing. - I should have bought a year book. - What for? I'm not even out of here and I'm trying to forget this place. - I know, but I could have had Bonnie sign. - You'd pay 20 bucks to have her sign, "Dear Bo, have a nice summer. Don't change. Love, Bonnie." - Hi, Bonnie. - Oh. Hello, Bob. - [Man] Look at this picture right here. - Bitch. She always called me fucking Bob. I hate that. It's such a joke name. - Bob's a cool name. You can spell it the same way forward and backward. Bob. Stick around. - I found out. The party's at Joe's house after the ceremony. His parents are going to San Diego. - What time? - What time what? - What time at Joe's? - It's invitation only. - How do you get to Joe's? - [Girl] Take a hint. - [Friend] Yeah. - Good morning, graduate. Can I help you? What's your name? - Roy. - Hello, Roy. I'm Sargent Jack Cope with the United States Marine Corps. I see you're interested in avionics. You know, Roy, now is a fine time to enlist. Presently, we offer a delayed entry program. Which you can earn a $5,000 bonus, and a guaranteed duty region. Not to mention-- - I don't care about that. - [Man] Well, Roy, what is your specific interest? - Did you ever kill anybody? - [Man] Sounds like you're more interested in being a grunt. - Hey, did you see some guy was killed here last night? No? Yeah, they shot some guy. He was robbing a liquor store and they just shot him. Right in the head. You didn't see that? - No, it was just a couple dicks fucking around. (all laughing) - You're kiddin'. (school bell ringing) (all chattering) - Joke. That's pretty funny. That's very funny. - Marines say nobody likes to fight. But somebody has to know how. - Hey there, Jarhead, no offense, we have just been invited to Joe's party. Can you believe it? You didn't enlist, did you, Roy? Sarge, if you're looking for a few good men, he ain't one of them. - No. Your friend here is not interested in the corp. He's just curious. (dog barking) (car horn honking) - Hold on a second. (engine revving) (heavy rock music) What happened to the fuzzy dice? - What the fuck? It's the only thing I ever got out of high school. - Yeah? I, my friend, got 200 bucks. - Rip off the graduation dance? - Oh, fuck. Get serious, man. My grandfather in Phoenix sent it. Can you believe that? Did you get anything? (snorting) (laughing) Son. Look. I don't often tell you I'm proud of you. You're destined for great things, Roy. I've always wanted you to be better than me. Not like the rest of the kids. You know, son, your future is wide open. - So are Bonnie Roberts' legs. I hope. - Ha. To the future. - Bonnie goes Greek. - [Both] Bonnie goes Greek. Bonnie goes Greek. Bonnie goes Greek. We are there. We are there. We are there, we are there. We are there. We are there. We are there. (upbeat rock music) - Joe really knows how to throw a good party. - Right. (girls shouting) - Congratulations, graduates. - Oh, no. Look who's here. - Excuse me. I think I'm nauseous. - Oh, hey. - Hey, could you guys help me out? Look, I don't want any trouble, all right? So uh, guys, be cool. Okay, yeah. You be cool and uh, no problems. Okay? And we'll just ignore them. So let's have fun. - Right. - We're gonna have some fun. Let's go, have fun. Come on, let's go.

But we don't get out in two months. And then it's six months. Then you wake up, and it's 30 fucking years later. - So what do you want us to do? Huh, Roy? Become computer programmers? Maybe fly the space shuttle? I don't know, perform a couple heart transplants? Look, I don't know about you, man, but I am not having a good time in LA. ll mean, Jesus Christ, we were beaten up by a couple of girls. And on top of all this shit, we lose Boner, the Barbarian. - Stupid dykes. Where do they get off calling us fags? - I mean, wouldn't it be great if the government declared like, an official caveman day? I mean, you could just knock girls over the head, drag them back to your house, and completely drill their socks off. You could do anything. You could throw rocks at people, run around naked. Take a shit in the middle of the street. Just be totally prehi-fucking-storic. - Better than Valentine's Day. - All right, listen.

She is beautiful, man. - [Roy] What are we gonna do? Follow this babe all night long? Let's play some games, huh. - Now, this is my game. - [Roy] Hey, got any quarters? - Hi. I was uh, wondering if you want to play me this game? - Well, okay. - [Automated Voice] Prepare for battle. (lasers blasting) - Ladies first. (lasers blasting) - Oh, shit. You're up. - [Bo] Hold on, I'm gonna blast him. (lasers blasting) (game buzzing) - Shit. - Well, those things always get me too. - [Man] Here, let me show you. (lasers blasting) - All right. You're great. - Shit. I suck at these games. Such a dick. Forget it, man. That's the way things are. - Pushed me right out of there. That mother fucker. - That mother fucker. He's the one who will keep us from going anywhere. - [Automated Voice] Destroy. - Come on, son. I'll buy you some candy. (laser blasting) (sobbing) - What happened? - Well, that fag said the dead fag picked up on uh, two boys at some butt-slammer bar on Santa Monica Blvd. - You have such a way with words. - Yeah? Well, if it happens to be your guys, things are gonna get worse. Thanks. The dead fag had an unregistered .38. - Had? - Yeah. It's missing. - Terrific. - Everybody's got a gun these days. They're more popular than sex. - What's his name? - Dwayne. - Dwayne, may I ask you a few questions? I know how you must feel right now. But we need to know about those boys you saw your friend-- - Chris. - Chris. Is there anything you could tell us to help us out? - Yeah. Their names are Bo and Roy. They both looked around 18. They drove up in a gray car. A Plymouth Road Runner. - How do you know the make? - Jesus Christ. I didn't just play with dolls when I was little. - Sorry. Did you happen to get a license number? - No. I don't go around memorizing license numbers. - All right. Dwayne, did Chris seem upset to you earlier this evening? Was there anything on his mind that could have made him susceptible to something like this? - He was a little uptight, I guess. We just had an argument. We uh, haven't been getting along lately. I'm sorry. That's all I can think of right now. - That's fine. I understand. Thank you, Dwayne. (crying) - It still doesn't make sense. We have an Iranian and a homosexual. Where's the connection? - Put out an APB on a gray Road Runner and those two kids. Concentrate a patrol on the West End. Let's go check out that bar. Uh, what's it called? - The End Zone. Good name for a fudge packer bar. Don't you think? - [Ed] You've got a mouth like a toilet. - This place is perfect. Everybody's so squeaky clean. And all that money to burn. What do you want to do? - You want to go to a movie? - No. We didn't come to LA to go to a movie. Let's try something different tonight. - Like what? That Body Shop place? That's one way for you to see a girl getting naked. - Nah. - What about the laser rock show, huh? - Boring. - I don't know, man. Nothing sounds exciting. Ain't they just the perfect couple? (ominous ambient music) - What the hell are we doing here? - Watching. - You're crazy. (laughing) - Do you want to get to know her? - What? - Come on. - Oh, Jesus. I'm gonna look like an asshole. (clattering) (gasping) - This is my game, sucker. (gun firing) (grunting) - [Bo] No, no, wait. (gun firing) - Come on, Bo. Come on. Let's go, man. (yelling) Hey, cut it out. - Why did you kill her? You did not have to Kill her. - What were you gonna do? Ask her out? - [Woman Over Radio] Put out anything verifying the date of birth, 4-28-70. Have your next sequence of boys stand by. Units on four. (dog barking) - [Ed] Are you Walkins? - Yeah. - You responded to our APB. I'm Ed Hanley. - Oh, yeah. Well, we've been here about 40 minutes. - What did you come up with? - Well, I think we came up with a couple of pretty good leads. Here. See for your self. (all chattering) - Taking a break? You all right, Mark? - Sometimes it just gets to me. - Report says the neighbors heard three shots. Saw two boys. One called the other Bo. They drove away in a gray car. The bullet passed through the girl and lodged in the back seat. -.387 - Yeah. - Well, what do we do now? - We've got the APB. Nothing to add to it. We've got no license. No last name. - Which boils down to, we're not gonna learn anything new until they do it again. - Calm down, Mark. - I can't calm down. That's the fucking problem, Hanley. Everybody calms down. Everybody accepts it. I feel so fucking useless. - I'll call the Captain and notify him of the urgency of the situation. - Situation? It's a fucking epidemic. - There's a lot of people out there. - It's you and me up here. Watching them. - You still thinking about the Marines? I don't know. I was just wondering if you still got that stuff inside you. - No. Why? Scared? - No. I just feel bad about that girl. I don't... I did not want to hurt her. - She didn't know what hit her. We gave her two seconds of pain. Girls like that wind up giving us 18 years of pain. Don't expect me to feel sorry for her. - Yeah, but you have got to stop, Roy. - What are you talking about? I wasn't alone. - Well, I don't want to sound like a fag or nothing, but you are my best friend. And I think that if you don't get control of this shit, they're gonna lock us up. - They lock us up Monday, pal. - Turn on the hockey game. Turn on the fucking hockey game. - This is summer. Hockey is in the winter. There's no hockey on television. Right, Angie? Now, be quiet. You're bothering the customers. Anyway, this is the only time I can watch the news. - [Bo] Well, hello, there. - What's with this bartender? Hey. - Can we get a couple beers down here? - You kids have some ID? - What? - We don't serve minors. - Minors? - Yeah, minors. - Ask me what year I was born. Come on, quick. Ask me, what year? - What year were you born? - 1951. - That would make you 33. - Exactly. - Have a nice life. - [Newscaster] The young man and woman were both residents of the Westwood Area. - We expect to have a complete report for you by tomorrow morning. And at this time, there is no apparent motive. - [Newscaster] If you have any information regarding these suspects, please call the following number. 555-9949 - [Al] Can you believe it? People are crazy. Are you going home? - Did you get it? - [Angie] Night, Al. - [Al] Yeah, see you, Angie. - [Newscaster] To dive off a 30 foot water tower on his own. Jensen and his act. - Excuse me. - Where's the action around here? - Action. There is no action around here. This is LA. - Oh, right. Well, do you know of any after-hours bars anywhere? - Gee. No, I don't. But I sure could use another beer. Want to get some and come back to my apartment? - Oh, yeah. Sure. I'd, I'd love to. - Where's your car? - Just up ahead. - My name's Angie. - Hi. I'm Bo. And this is Roy. - Hi, Bo. - Hi. Do you live very far from here? - Oh, no, I don'. - Well, that's good. How far do you live? - Well-- - Oh, fuck. - I don't believe this. - What's the note say? - Thanks for taking up two parking places, asshole. (laughing) Son of a bitch. - Listen, Roy. There's a lot of tension in the air right now. Mercury is in retrograde. Venus is opposing Saturn. The moon's in Scorpio. - What does that have to do with my car? - Well, if you know your place in the cosmos, the world is beautiful. Just think to yourself, the world is beautiful. - Fuck the world. (engine revving) (tires screeching) (laughing) - Hey. What do you think you're doing? Hell yes, it's important. Would I call the police if it wasn't important? What? Okay, I'll wait. - Hey. Let's go to her house. By the time we come back, these cars will be gone. If we have to come back. You know what I mean? - Hey, you guys, what are you gonna do? Huh? - Nice. - No fair.

But your senses need to be more highly attuned. You know what I mean? - What? - This stuff is all bullshit. - You know, you have very negative energy. It's gonna prevent you from getting anywhere in this life. Let's make this more interesting. Want to? - Wait, we'll throw with rocks? - If you make it, you get to kiss me.

(tires screeching) - What are you doing? - Get out. (sirens wailing) - Huh? Are you crazy? I can't shoot at a cop. I don't believe this. - [Woman Over Radio] Stolen vehicle is a red Ford Maverick. 173, George, Jordan, Libra. Suspect is wanted for suspicion of homicide. Roy Alston. Last seen heading westbound on Melrose near Fairfax. (sirens wailing) - Hey. Pull over. - This is ridiculous, man. You should've stole a faster car. - Oh, fuck. Watch this.

This party's over. - Huh? - We did some pretty fucked up things. - So what? We can get out of here. No problem. - [Bo] It's time to stop, Roy. We got three shots left. - [Roy] I'll fire off one. They'll take cover. Get down here, so they don't know we're out. - No. We can't go back to the car. We can't go to the motel. We can't go home. We're fucking busted. - Christ. Gimme the gun. - No. You're not getting it. - I don't care what you're doing, man. I'm gone. - Gone? What the fuck, gone where? Look, they might give us a break. We're only kids, right? If 1 give you this gun, they'll kill you. - I can't go back, Bo. Not now. Give me the fucking gun. (voice echoing) (ominous ambient music) What are you doing, man? - I'm your best friend, Roy.
