ZAKHARCHENKO Fomin - V. BUBNOV QUIET FLOWS THE DON - Why don't you talk? - What shall I talk with you about? About your drinking sprees and your whoring. You know already? The whole village knows. There're people who talk. If you know, why do you ask? - So you're doing it again? - Leave me alone, Natalya. You damned insatiable lecher! Why are you torturing me again? Aren't you ashamed to look your children in the face? Stop listening to gossip. Yes, I’ve wronged you a bit. Our life makes us to do wrong, Natalya. We walk on the edge of death. Well, sometimes a man trips. I’ve even taken to drink. Recently I had a fit. Life is not right. Maybe it's my fault, too. We should've made peace with the Reds now against the Cadets. But how? Who'll heal the breach between us and the Soviets now? My head is all mixed up, Natalya. Stop pulling the wool over my eyes. You've been a swine and now you blame it on the war. Haven't I suffered enough on account of you? I wish I’d finished myself off that time. Shall I give you a hand, Grisha? I don't need any help. Oh, Grigory Panteleyevich, you're so stern with me, poor widow. Never give me a smile, or even a shrug. - You'd better go cooking. - Who wants it! Then help Natalya. Mishatka runs around all dirty. That's all I need! You make them and I must wash them? Natalya is as fertile as a bitch, she'll make another dozen for you. My hands will fall off to wash them all. Go away. Grigory Panteleyevich, you're the only Cossack left in the village. Don't drive me away, let me look from a distance at your tempting black moustache. What a woman you are! How could Pyotr live with you? You never miss a guy. You bet I won't. You know, Grisha, the young girls tell me: «It's not fair. There're no Cossacks here, and Grisha never leaves his wife's side. Though he's only a half of what he used to be, we would be happy to touch that half.» I say to them: «No, girls, Grisha is lame only at the others' places, but at home he clings to Natalya's skirt. Lately he's become a saint.» What a bitch! You're a real blabbermouth! That's the way I am. But if you were mine, I’d knock all your bravery out of you. Good day, dear Aksinya. Good day. It's been a long time. Yes, a long time. I’ve even forgotten the sound of your voice. - So soon? - You think, too soon? Have we nothing to say to each other? Why don't you say something? We've already said it all, I suppose. Really? I think so. A tree only blossoms once a year. You think ours has already shed its blossoms? Don't you think so? It's so strange. Yet I can't tear you out of my heart, Ksyusha. I have grown children, I myself am turning gray, and I still think of you. I see you in my dreams, I still love you. - And when I remember... - Me too... I must go too. We talked too long. This is the spot where our love began. - Remember? - I remember everything. - Darya! - Who is there? It's me, Aksinya. Come here. - Why would you want me? - I need you very much. What's this? A ring? - For me? - For you. A keepsake from me. It's gold. Keep it. Oh, for Christ's sake. What do you want me to do for it? Tell... Tell Grigory to come out. You start it all again? I want to talk to him about helping Stepan get a leave. - Why don't you come in then? - No, Natalya might think... All right, I’ll tell him. Why should I worry about him? At the village of Ust-Khopyorskaya What is it? - Good morning. Is Koshevoy home? - What happened? It's trouble. A mutiny in the Serdobsky Regiment. The infantry have disarmed the battery. They're holding a rally by the church right now. - Where's Koshevoy? - He went to Ust-Medveditskaya. I had a hunch yesterday that some trouble was brewing. Get ready. - Where're the other Communists? - Who knows? - Communists, all to a meeting. - Coming. You can leave the guns. You're not going to battle. Glory to the rank-and-filer! Silence! Silence! Silence! Red Army men! Shame on you! You're betraying the people's government! At the most critical moment! You've been sold to Cossack generals! Your commanders are traitors! Bullshit! Come to your senses! They use you to undermine the rule of the workers and the peasants! Don't! Don't dare! You'll have enough time to kill me. Glory to the Communist fighter! You can kill me... But let me speak! Let me speak! You can kill me, but I repeat: come to your senses! Your regiment commander... Osip Davydovich! You've been misled. But Communism... Will anyway... Death! Death to Communists! To the enemies of working peasants! Beat them! They're coming! Here come the prisoners! The enemy prisoners! Look, it's Ivan Alexeyevich... Look, they've got Kotlyarov! I see. Look in their dishonest eyes. Enough! They've had their fun! They wanted to get the land, didn't they? Here's one from your village. Look at him, the bastard! And where's the other? Where's Mishka Koshevoy? Only one from your village. If we tear him to pieces, there'll be enough for everybody. Come on, neighbour, step back. - Hello, friend. - Hello, Darya. Tell me, my dear, how you killed my husband Pyotr. No, Darya, I didn't kill him. What do you mean you didn't? Wasn't it you and Mishka Koshevoy who killed our Cossacks? I was in that battle. So you were! What are you doing?! Are you going to kill your own? Bitch! Why locking yourselves up with some rope? Anybody home? What's the matter? Where are Mother and Natalya? What's happened? Have the prisoners gone through? They killed them. Oh God, Grisha! Our Darya, the bitch, she herself shot Ivan Alexeyevich. You're lying! What about Shtokman and Koshevoy? They weren't among the prisoners. Mother and Natalya got scared and went to sleep with neighbours. Darya came home drunk as a beast. She's sleeping by the barn. Viper! Good morning, my good old men! Good morning, Your Excellency! Please accept bread and salt as a welcome from the Cossacks. Thank you. Please. As you see, only old men, women and children are left in the village, who can't wear arms. You may begin. All the Cossacks fight on the fronts for our common cause. Darya Timofeyevna Melekhova! - Melekhova! - I’m here! What? Oh, yes... Are you the widow of the killed Cornet Melekhov? Yes. You're going to receive money too, 500 rubles. The Don Government thanks you for your display of valour and expresses its sympathy. Can I go? Yes, yes, of course. We're awarding women who have shown courage fighting the Bolsheviks. The first recipient, an officer's widow, herself killed a commissar famous for his cruelty. O Lord! What did they give you a medal for? For Ivan Alexeyevich, may he rest in peace, the bastard! And this is... for Pyotr. - What will you do with it? - With what? - What will you do with the money? - Whatever I want to. Take it, Mother, to remember Pyotr. Order a mass for him and hold a wake. A few more medals for me and I’ll be a general! While the officers are fighting, who is going to train the old men? So they'll be put under my command. Will I drill them, the old devils! That's how I’ll drill them! Attention, old men! Beards pointing upwards! Right, march! And there they march, my old men. One-two! One-two! Stop your playing. Blow on it. O Lord... What's the matter with you? Come on, come on... I’m going to die soon, Natalya. Stop talking nonsense. Don't kiss me. Why not? I’m diseased. Now you've done it... Don't be afraid. It's not catching this way. Listen, Natalya, I want to confess to you. I’ll die soon anyway. Whose ring is this? Come on, don't be afraid too soon. You know whose ring this is? Right, our neighbour Aksinya's. And why did she give it to me? Think about it. For sending Grigory out to her. - Did you never guess it? - I guessed it. If you did, why didn't you ask him? Want me to find out the truth from Aksinya? She'll tell me everything. No, I don't want any favours from you. It's not for pity of me you confessed that you put them together, but to make me suffer even more. That's right! Why should I be the only one to suffer? Do you love your man so much? As well as I can. It means you do. I’ve never known real love. If I had my life to live again... maybe I’d be different. I see you're looking ill again. Anything wrong between you and Grigory? He's gone back to Aksinya, Mother. How... how do you know? It's true, Mother. It's your own fault. Have to keep your eye on a man like him. I can't tie him to my skirt. He's gone gray already but doesn't let off. Is that all your troubles? Oh, Mother... What do you mean to do? What can I do? Take the children and go to my old folks. I won't live with him anymore. I thought so too when I was young. My husband was the same kind. But where will you go? Who else needs you? And to take the children from their father! Besides, you're expecting another. No, I won't even hear of it. No, Mother, I won't live with him any longer. And I won't bear him any more children! How can you say such things? You have no shame. Come on, enough. Stop crying, save some tears for next time. O Lord! He's wrung my heart out of me! I can't go on like this! May the Lord punish him! May the Lord strike him dead! Let him be dead and not torture me any more! - Have you gone mad? - Punish him, O Lord! Stand on your knees! You hear me, Natalya? Ask God's forgiveness. Say you take those words back. Praying for the death of your children's father! What a sin! Bow to the ground and say: «O Lord, forgive me for my sins.» En-cy-clo-pe-di... Encyclopedia. Wait. And here? Cookbook. Where's Natalya? - What? - Where is Natalya? Collected a bundle and went out. - When? - In the morning. And what did she say? What bundle? How do I know? Took a clean skirt, something else, and didn't say anything. Oh, poor girl... Oh, what a misfortune... What a misfortune! Is Father home? What have you done to yourself?! Hush, Mamma. Help me to bed. It's all right, it's all right... Oh, poor girl... Why are you standing? Prepare the bed. Strip off the clean linen. Spread old rags instead. Shut up. Go away and don't come back! You have nothing to do here. Get the horse and drive for the doctor. What are you talking about? Now what's happened? Natalya... The shameless woman! To do a thing like that! Father, don't come in, for Christ's sake. To do such a thing, the Devil's daughter! Are you crazy, old man? Don't poke in here! Why are you dawdling, like a beetle in the dunghill? Natalya's dying! Go! Or I’ll go myself! Have you gone crazy? Shut up, you sticking scab! Shouting at your father! Cover me with a fur coat. When I die, Mamma, dress me in my green skirt, the one with a stitched flounce. Grisha liked it on me. Don't cry, Mamma... It's nothing... You said you'd be dying soon, Darya. You have years and years ahead of you. And here my last hour has come. What's the matter with you, Mamma? I’ve fallen ill. Come closer, my poor boy. - Will you have supper, Mamma? - I don't know. I think not. Then I’ll bring it in here, all right? Bend down, Mishatka. You're so like your father... Only kinder-hearted... Give him to me. Grigory Panteleyevich, not so fast, you'll kill the horse! Grigory Panteleyevich! The horse is done for! We couldn't save her... In the late July of 1919, the Don White Guard Army's forward units were stationed at Balashov. «Rule Britannia, Britannia rule the waves.” To your country, Mr. Campbell. What a wonderful country it is, Captain. You can't imagine it. But I lived there. Let's drink. Mr. Campbell doesn't believe we'll beat the Reds. - He doesn't? - No, he doesn't. He criticizes our army and praises the Reds. This damned cognac! Strong as pure alcohol. Yes, pretty powerful. You know, I like you, Captain. But why are you so sad? What happened, Captain? My wife died recently. Oh, it's awful. Why does he think highly of the Reds? Think highly? Who said he does? You said so. Impossible! He can't think highly of them. I’ll ask him. - What's he saying? - Wait. He's seen them marching along, he's seen barefooted soldiers going against tanks. That was enough for him. He says you can't win fighting the people. He's a fool! Don't believe him. - Why not? - Don't believe a word of his. - What do you mean? - He's drunk and talking nonsense. Why can't you win the people? Part of them... can be killed off. And the rest brought into execution. What did I say? Execution? No, into submission. Listen to me: Go back home quick. While you still have a head on your shoulders. No reason for you to get mixed up in our affairs. Go, please, or you'll be sorry. - You hear the music, granny? - What music? Which is all bass music. I hear, but I can't understand what it is. You'll soon understand. It's cannon fire. They're tearing our old men's guts out. When the Don freezes over, the Reds will chase us all the way to the sea. - Where're you going? - Bathing in the Don. Who bathes in this season? It's all right, Mamma. Oh, God... Go and play in the yard. Keep off the street, or they'll trample you down. Mishatka, come here. My dear boy! Grisha's son. My darling! I’ve missed you so much. What a fool, your Aunt Aksinya. Oh, what a fool! - Don't look at me. - Why not? Don't look, I don't like it. Since when you don't? I don't and that's it. All right, I’ll go in like this. - Hello, Mashutka! - Hello! Goodbye, Dunya! Darya, what's the matter? Come back! Darya! Darya's drowned! Darya's drowned! Darya's drowned! Father long mobilized? No. He was hiding but Mitka Korshunov betrayed him. Even relatives turn against each other, nowadays. - He's no relative to us. - The beast, real beast. Killed Granny Koshevaya and the children. That was his revenge to Mishka. And nobody stopped him? Who would? Everyone has his own troubles. Too bad I wasn't here. You're getting old, brother. All gray like a lone wolf. My time has come. It's my time to grow old, yours to seek a bridegroom. Only listen to my words. Don't you dare think of Mishka Koshevoy. My feeling sorry for his mother changes nothing. This is a different matter. If I hear you're seeing him, I’ll tear you limb from limb, like a frog. - When are you leaving? - Tomorrow. You know... I want to take Aksinya Astakhova with me. You have no objections? What do I care? You can take as many as two Aksinyas. It'll be hard on the horses. What the devil do you want her for? That's none of your business. Well, the war's over. The Reds gave us such a push, we'll run all the way to the sea now until we end up with our ass in the salty water. What are you grinning at? You look like a young bride. Glad to have escaped from the village? Of course, I am. Some escape. You're a stupid woman. Who knows how this excursion is going to end. I won't be worse off, anyhow. You'd better keep mum. Where's your husband? Running away with a lover and going nobody knows where! What if Stepan comes home, what then? You know what, Prosha? You'd better not meddle in our affairs, or you'll have no luck either. Save your bickering. We've a long way to go, you'll have enough time. - Grisha! - I’m here, I’m here. You see? I’m here, Ksyusha. Grisha... It's bad, Grisha. Grisha... I’m here. I’m here, Ksyusha. Close the door tightly. - Is she his wife? - Yes, his wife. Any children? Yes, we've got everything but luck. Listen, friend, help me in my trouble, for Christ's sake. We can't take her any farther, she'll die. Let her stay with you. I’ll pay you for taking care of her. Naturally. Who would look after her for nothing? As it is we've more work than we can manage. Do it, please. I’ll remember your kindness all my life. How much would you pay? How much can you afford? Take all I have. What kind of money is that? Haven't you any tsarist bills? No. Maybe Kerensky's, then? - This money isn't very reliable. - I have no Kerensky's money. Do you want my horse? - Take it. - Take it... It's no use, If the Whites don't confiscate it, the Reds will. What? What? Here, take this! Choke on it. All right, we'll do you the favour. Novorossiyisk March 27, 1920 While we fought, they needed us. Now they don't care a hoot for us. Damn them, let's get away from here. Let's go to Tiflis, and from there to the Turks. Have to save our skins somehow. Why are you as gloomy as a fish? No, I won't go. What for? Anyway, it's too late. Look! The Reds! And once again spring came to the village of Tatarsky. Good day, dear neighbour. You've been away a long time. Why do you stare at me and keep silent? Have you brought bad news? What about Grigory... Was he sick when you parted? No, he wasn't sick. Thank God for that. It can't be that I should lose my last son. There's nothing for God to punish me for. Don't worry about him, Grandma. He won't get sick. He's strong as iron. Such men don't die. Did he ever think of the children? Yes, of both you and the children. Are they well? What can happen to them? But Panteley Prokofievich had died when they retreated. We're left all alone now. Well, goodbye. When you get settled, come to see us. If you hear from Grigory, let me know. All right, Grandma. Hello, Aunt Ilyinichna. You weren't expecting me, were you? Hello. What are you to me that I should expect you? A twice-removed cousin to our fence? - We were acquainted, you know. - And nothing more. - I haven't come to live with you. - That's all we need! Where is Dunyasha? Tidying up the house. You're an early guest. Good people don't come that early. I’ve been longing for her. I didn't care what time it was. Mikhail, you'd better not make me angry. How am I angering you, auntie? How can you have the gall to come to our house? How dare you even ask? Who killed Pyotr? Wasn't it you? Yes, I did. Then what are you to be called after that? And you come here and sit down as if... - Hello. - Hello. Go and fetch water. How can you face me? I’ve no reason to hang my head. If Pyotr had caught me, what would he have done? He would have killed me too. We weren't at war with each other in order to play kissing games. War is war, you know. And my hand is steady when I see the enemy. That's why you've gone all yellow, because of that steadiness. It must be your conscience that's eating you. Not my conscience, but a fever. - Otherwise, Mother, I would... - I’m not a mother to you! Murderer! Get out of here! Get out! I can't bear the sight of you. And your Mitka Korshunov, isn't he a murderer? And Grigory? Why do you keep quiet about him? If anybody's a murderer, it's he! Are you going to mow in the meadow? Everybody went to the other bank. We have nothing to cross in. The boat's dried up. It should be put in the water. Who's is going to drag it down there? Have you got any tow? There must be some. I’ll see. - Hello, namesake. - Hello. What are you going to do? What I’m going to do? Have to fix your boat. Will you make a small rake for me? I will. What is it with you? Listen, namesake, bring me some covering. I’ll lie down. Grandma! Grandma! Uncle Mikhail is lying in the shed, all shivering. Why don't you say something, Grandma? Take him a blanket. Let him cover himself, the antichrist. He's got a fever. - Can you carry it? - I can. Wait! Don't bother. Dunya! - Prokhor Zykov is back. - Really?! He got wounded. I’ll go see if he knows anything about Grigory. Hello, companion! Never thought to see you alive. Hello, Prokhor. I see that typhus makes your kind even prettier. Come on in, sit down. Be our guest. Let's talk until my wife is back. I’ve sent her for some home brew. See how Polacks have worked on me? Damn the bastards! You'd better tell me... I know. Grigory asked me to give you a bow for him. Why are you howling, you fool? Women! Bad news or good, they howl! Wipe your face. He's alive and well, he's even put on weight. In Novorossiyisk, the two of us joined Comrade Budyonny's Cavalry. Right. Grigory was put in command of a hundred. A squadron. And I was under him. And we went straight to Kiev. Will he be coming on leave?.. Don't even dream of it. He said: «I’ll serve until I atone for my past sins.» Ever in battle. He's earned a citation. That's your Grigory for you! Sit down, let's have tea. No, thanks... Go on, then, run and tell the whole village. What are you doing, Mamma? Well, Dunyasha... When I come in from the yard, it eases my heart. As if he's with us already. Mamma, give me your blessing to marry Mikhail. There you go again! No, I won't give you my blessing. I won't give you to him. Then I’ll run away from home. Are you mad?! What will I do alone with the children? Do you want to ruin us? As you wish, Mamma. I’ll go all the same. People are saying we hired Mikhail to be our labourer. My late mother blessed me with this icon. Taken all your things? That's better... Don't take any of mine. Why the burial clothes? It's early for you to be thinking of dying. God forbid! No... it's time. Look after the children till Grisha comes. I’m afraid I won't live to see him. Why a church wedding? - Can't we do without? - No, Misha, don't even mention it. Mother feels bad enough about us as it is. Oh, well... What can I do with you? Grisha! My darling! My dear son! Mamma's getting ready to die. What do you want? You can retire, old man. I’ve been appointed in your place. - Thank God! - Hand over all the stuff. Here, son, are all the papers. And more papers. And still more. And here's... There it is! The village seal. Take it all, for the love of Christ. And what about me? I’m over 70. It's time for me to make my peace with the Lord, instead they've made me a chairman. - Where's the secretary? - What? - I say, where's the secretary? - Out sowing. He's not been around since Yegoryev Day. When an important paper arrives, you can't find him even with dogs. And I can hardly sign my name, and can't read at all. All I can do is stamp papers. This is the lot. There's no money. No ataman's scepter under the Soviets. If you like, I can leave you my crutch. Well, granddad, let's say you've handed everything over. Now get the hell out of here! - Where to? - Take yourself home! Ah, all right. I recognized you at once. You're the late Koshevoy's son. - Yes, I am. - Good day to you, then. Go, go! - What happened? - Grisha's come home! Congratulations. - Hello, Misha. - Hello, hello! It's been a long time. Like a hundred years. Yes, you're right. Welcome home. Thanks. So we're kin now? Yes, looks like it. What's that blood on your cheek? Cut myself while shaving. I was in a hurry. What is it? Want to call someone to kill a sheep. The master ought to be given a fitting welcome. Tell Prokhor Zykov to dig up some home brew. He knows better how to do it. And invite him for supper. Well... my dear hostess? Grigory Panteleyevich! Grigory Panteleyevich! My dear man! I never thought I’d live to see the day! - Come for good? - For good. What rank did you rise to? Deputy regimental commander. Why did they discharge you so soon? Had no more use for me. Why so? Because of my past, I guess. Where's Mikhail? In the yard. Platon Ryabchikov was shot last month. - No, they couldn't! - Believe me, they did. Well, we'll talk later. Let's drink, Commander! Come in, Ksyusha. Sit down, be our guest. Hello. Hello, Ksyusha. Sit down. Our companion, Ksyusha! We retreated together, we fed lice together. Drink to the health of Grigory Panteleyevich. Don't listen to him, he's already drunk. To your return, Grigory Panteleyevich! And to your joy, Dunya. What about you? To your sorrow? And to my joy! A great joy. Bottoms up, for Christ's sake. You talk straight, drink straight, too. When something's left in the glass, it's like a knife in my heart. You, Mikhail, are like a calf in those matters. And I know about drinks. There's such a wine - you hardly take a cork out, and it's all foaming, like a rabid dog. That night I fell from my horse three times, as if I was blown off. A glass of such wine is great on an empty stomach. How are you? Oh, there's too much to tell. - Will you come? - I will. I’m not taking the jug. I hate to walk with an empty vessel. My wife will nag me. Will you get home all right? I will, even if I’ll have to crawl. Aren't I a Cossack? You're insulting me. Wait. Shall we talk, Mikhail? All right, let's talk. Something's wrong between us. My coming isn't to you liking, is it? Right, it isn't. - Why not? - Additional trouble. Don't worry, I can make my own living. I didn't mean that. What, then? You and I are enemies. - We were. - I guess we will. Why? You killed too many of our fighters. That's why I can't look at you and not feel hatred. I can't forget it. You've got a good memory. You killed my brother Pyotr, and I don't remind you about it. If we remember everything, we'll live like wolves. I can imagine how you would've talked to me if we had the Cadets' rule now, if it were you who had won over. I guess you would've cut belts out of my back. But now you seem so kind. I don't know about others, but I’d not have dirtied my hands with you. So we're not alike. I’ve never been too shy to dirty my hands with the enemy, and if need be, would do it right now. Want to have a drink? Yes, for we seem to be too sober for this talk. So you're afraid, Mikhail, that I will rebel against the Soviets? I’m afraid of nothing, but I’m sure that once there's some trouble, you'll join the other side. I’m not going to join anybody. I’ve done my service. I’m not going to serve anybody any more. In my life I’ve done more than enough fighting. My soul is exhausted. I’m fed up with everything: revolution, counter-revolution. Let it all go to hell! I want to live with my children and work at the farm. That's all. No, man, that's not all. The revolutionary tribunal won't be asking you what you want. When are you going to register at Vyoshenskaya? - One of these days. - You must go tomorrow. Give me a day to rest. I won't run away. The devil only knows. I don't want to be responsible for you. What a bastard you've become. Don't you bastard me. I’m not used to that. You ought to get rid of those officer's ways of yours. Go there tomorrow. If you don't go by yourself, I’ll have you convoyed. Is it clear? Everything's clear to me now. My darling Grisha... How gray you've gotten. You're growing old, aren't you? Oh, what a lad you used to be! It's Dunyasha. Run quick, brother! Four men have come from the town, they say you're to be arrested. Thank you, sister. Some bread, quick! Not the whole one, just a piece! Go back or they'll notice your absence. Goodbye. Goodbye. I’ll send word of myself. Through Prokhor. Lock the door. If they ask, say I went to Vyoshenskaya. Goodbye. Grisha... Stop! Stop, son of a bitch! Who are you? A Communist? Hands out of your pockets or I’ll slice your head off! - Go ahead. - Where to? Forward! Hands behind your back! - And who are you? - Russian Orthodox men. Go on. Melekhov? Hello. Really, the steppe is wide, but the road is narrow! Where've you turned up from? - Hello. - Hello. Take your coat off and sit down. Where did my guys catch you? Near the village. Where were you heading? Wherever my feet took me. You think we caught you and take your to Vyoshenskaya? No, man, we're barred from that place. Don't get scared. We don't serve the Soviets any longer. We're divorced from them. I’m thinking of stirring up the Cossacks. Stop fidgeting. Do you hear me? We hear there's war all around, there're rebellions everywhere, in Siberia, in the Ukraine, and even in Petrograd. The whole fleet has risen in that fortress... what's its name... In Kronshtadt. Idiot! Well, what do you decide? Speak up and let's go to bed. Decide about what? Are you going with us or what? You can't hide in someone else's barns all your life. You're right. I’ve got no choice. I’ll join your band. What do you mean, band? Stop calling us names. Why do you call us a band? It's the Communists who call us that, but you shouldn't. We're just rebels. Brief and clear. All right, that's it. I’m giving you my horse. I’ve got another one. The red-haired one. Cossacks! You know of your own experience what burdens the Soviets have saddled you with. If they're not overthrown, you'll face final ruin. Good day! See my strong army! With such boys, we can win over the devil himself. The Soviets are doomed. And you? Stop your babbling. Cossacks! Learn how to speak from me. Cossacks! As of today, we free you of a requisition for farm produce. You are not to deliver grain any more! It is time to stop feeding the Communist parasites! They've been fattening on your bread! But we're ending all that. You are free people! Arm yourselves and support our government! Hurray, Cossacks! Your government is good, but have you brought us soap? Whose bread are you eating? They'll start stealing from our houses. They've got sabers, they'll cut our chickens' heads. What do you mean, not to deliver grain? Today you're here, but tomorrow we're to answer for you? We won't give you our men! Go and fight yourselves. No one's going to join them. We don't need to rebel. It's time for harvesting, not fighting. Look at this one with a moustache, riding around stirring folk up. Don't you teach us! Nothing to say, red devil? Aren't I right? Shut up, you pockmarked bitch! Stop your agitating! You Bolshevik swine! I’ll knock this nonsense out of your head! I’ll have you whipped on your bare bottom, and you'll get to your senses! Like hell you will! Whipping me?! Go whistle for it! Look at him, our Tsar Liberator! To horse! The Reds! We'll yet see who wins. I shan't lay down arms. Sit down to supper, brigands. I’m a convinced fighter against the Soviets. And you call me a brigand. - Rightly so. - Rightly? Don't you understand, fool, that I’m fighting for an idea? Stop pulling wool over my eyes. Some «idealist» you are. A born brigand. Good or bad, but the Soviet government has held on since 1917. Anyone who fights against it is a brigand. Stop wolfing the food. You're not alone yet. There are four of us. If one goes, the other three will have more. What? You want to run away? I’ve nowhere to run and no one to run from. But I’m going and you can't stop me. Stop it, Melekhov! I’ll shoot! You won't. You can't risk any noise. Hello, Ksyusha! Wait! Quiet. Don't open the door. I’ll come through the window. How are you? Where have you been? What if you're caught, Grisha? Don't worry. Will you go with me? Where? To the south, the Kuban, or even farther. We'll earn a living. I’ll take any work. My hands long for work, not a gun. Will you go? What do you think? What do you think? I’d walk, I’d crawl anywhere after you. I can't live without you, Grisha. What about the children? Dunyasha will care for them. Afterwards we'll take them. So you going? Grisha! Once before we went like this to Yagodnoye. Only our bundle was bigger and we were younger. Why do you carry your rifle? What do you need it for? I’ll throw it away farther on. I’ll throw everything away, Ksyusha. Will you manage to hang on? Lord, I’d ride, or crawl, or anything. When we get out of the ravine, the going will be easier. Halt! Who goes there? Go on, Ksyusha! Keep lower! Halt! A hit, I think. For God's sake, say at least one word! Why don't you? What are you doing here? Whom have you buried? My wife. - Where are you going? - To look for an easy life. Come with me? An easy life? No. Go alone. And you, where will you go? Home? Yes, home. Take the horse. Thank you very much. Good luck. Good luck... Mishatka! My son! My little son... my son! The End
