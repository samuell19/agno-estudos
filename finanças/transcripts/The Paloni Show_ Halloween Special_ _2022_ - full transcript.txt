Oh yeah, yeah, of course. Clarence! - Well, hello there. - [gasps] Yes, you must be tonight's slab of gristle. Don't worry, I'm gentle. I, I assumed you'd be human. Yes, well, it's a legal loophole. - Guh... Do you have a reservation? - [woman sobs] You took my boy away. I know he agreed to it, but you took him out of this world and fed him to vultures and beasts. Madam, please. We do not serve vultures here. We serve the highest of society.

Ladies and gentlemen, tonight's main course is Nigel. He wanted to be an engineer, but it seemed like a lot of hard work, and nobody likes that. So tonight, he cuts his life short to serve you, our finest. [applause] But before he is butchered, he'd love to meet you all. So, bring him out. Uh, one moment, chaps. I will just check and see where he is. Aah! Get me out of here, I've changed my mind! You better let me go. Why isn't he tranquilized? Um, Lady Fridgely called ahead and she requested untranquilized meat tonight. Well, you still do it. - NIGEL: Please don't let me die. - Come here, boy. Let me slice you into pieces. [screams] MR.

Then they zapped a cat crawling on the floor, believing it was a man walking on all fours. Then they zapped a tree from their spaceship in the air. Because we were convinced... It was a man with bushy hair. NARRATOR: So they landed in a tub and they met an old lady. This one is actually a human. Let's turn her into gravy. NARRATOR: So the Armageddon started. JOHNNY: Here I am. Mom? NARRATOR: The boy said immediately, forgetting who had called him in the first place. He couldn't remember his mother or why he was in the bathroom again. All the memories erased from his young and chubby brain. Suddenly the plot thickens and one of the Martians disappeared. Zap! Like the dickens.

Then I call the girl I like, and then she's going to fall in love with me. NARRATOR: But then Johnny remembered that he wanted to be a hero. I'm going to be a hero!
