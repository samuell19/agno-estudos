They have been made possible by funding from Any resemblance to real persons... or events is wholly unintentional. Answer me. -What do you want me to say? That you'll get the money. After all, it is your baby! Not so loud. I found a doctor, I need the cash. Ok, you'll get your money. - When? - Let's not discuss it here. Where, at my folks'? Want them to find out? You know my dad. You've seen the bruises I got from him. Want me to get even more? In my condition? Let's go. Don't try to run away. Where'll you get the money? Where? Once more. What's up? - Your dad was laid off. Laid off? What do you mean? They're installing machines. Said I was finished. After 20 years, they could keep you on. With the wage they pay you... What'll you do? - What can I do? 100 of us will be retrained, the other 40 laid off. Go see the boss. Explain the situation. He must have a heart. He'll understand. You're an honest man. The plant was sold. Still... go see your new boss. You've nothing to lose. You'll see... Maybe he'll find you a cozy little office job. Don't give up, EugÃ¨ne. Men like you, hard workers like you... they're rare. - Mom! The men won't let us down. They're calling a strike. Come on... Be brave, my EugÃ¨ne. Everything'll work out. - Mom! I guess I'll call it a night. Well... till things get back to normal... I have $220 in the bank. Thank you. Thanks. GeneviÃ¨ve! Daddy, it's FranÃ§ois! It's RomÃ©o, my sister's boyfriend. She's so weird. What do they see in her? Won't last two weeks. What do you know? Ready for the scrapyard, huh, RomÃ©o? RomÃ©o! Eva, my sleeping beauty, I have a surprise. What is it? Come for its maiden voyage. - I want to go too! With Eva, there's no room for you. She won't be able to squeeze in! Careful with Gran! FranÃ§ois! I think... I think you can take me home. C'mon, nothing to be scared of. I'm not scared. Ok, we'll take you back. I wish I'd brought my camera. No one goes in! - Quit shouting and shoving, dammit! What good will this do? - It'll get people rehired. Those guys aren't needed now! That our fault? If we don't stand up, we may be next. I can't risk my paycheck. Goldwater's an American. He doesn't give a shit... he'd even hire those Italians. Goddamn jerks! Use your heads for once. Anyone who tries to enter, will end up flat as a pizza. Tomorrow, I'm going in. I'm not losing my pay cause of them. - We didn't force anyone. It was a majority decision. Look, he's right. It's useless. Like he says, they don't want us. What are you doing? - I wanted to show you my car. Talk some sense into your Dad. He could use it. Is that it? - It's not new... but I got it cheap: $79. The whole family can use it. She's pretty beat up... but you can't tell. - What's new? Not much. They'll start negotiating later. We're waiting. Everyone's waiting. Anything we can do? Paint some signs? You flunked drawing, remember? Don't hang around here. Go for a spin. Good luck! Those bandits! They pay slave wages... then kick people out after 20 years. - Nothing new. It's been that way forever. - I know. It must be hard for guys like your dad. He was so proud he could give us what we needed. What are you doing? - I always check what I eat. You can't be too careful. Know what I think? -You think? I think there's a good chance... we'll have fun this year. Why's that? Nice, huh? - I always look the same. Doesn't matter. Did you see this one? Real sexy. You know what your teacher likes. Look at this one. Hate to say this, but I don't think it's his bag. Or my next shots either. - Why not? Things'll get heavy on the picket line... and I plan to be there. When do we shoot you in your natural splendor? Stop teasing. You'll be beautiful. I'm a super photographer. If I hung them here, the shit would hit the fan. The neighbors, my family! - What's the family done now? Nosing around as usual. You aren't shy, my girl. - I have talent, don't you think? What do you plan on doing? My best. Well, then... You never told me his name. - Whose? The guy you slept with before... once or twice. - You don't know him. It doesn't matter. You're all I care about. I hope so. Like some cake? This cake's much tastier. GeneviÃ¨ve! Don't be jealous cause your mom wouldn't let you. No necking in this house. Want us to go to a motel? - JÃ©rÃ´me! I have to get a job. I can't stay here. Come on... This'll take a little while. It's a pain, but that's life. You're not going in. - No one stops me... going where I want. You won't be the first. No one crosses the line, scum! Thanks for the lift. Where you going? I'm not missing this. - It's no game, you know. Solidarity! Solidarity! Bastards! Enjoying it? - Crazy, trying to cross. If you had a family, you might try too. Watch out! Take some pictures, now's the time. Show them to the press. With elections coming up... they'll use'em. - I don't know. They're the best you've ever done. - Thanks! Sometimes I worry I'm losing... the little place I had in here... and in here. - Come off it, GeneviÃ¨ve. Too bad I didn't bring the school camera. I could've taken those pictures. With the apples, it would've been cute. We'll come back Sunday. - On one condition: You too. Me, what? - I'll take pictures of you... in your natural splendor. Let others have some fun too. No '' buts.'' Nature shots are all very nice... but it's not summer now. We'll see. Come on. Been here before? - Once. With who? - Friends. We came here to filch apples. You didn't pick me up today. I drove my dad to the plant. And tomorrow? I'll probably drive him again. This is tough on him. I could pick you up first. Why not? - He was like that when he came home, in an ugly mood. Bet you a quarter he can't light it. That's not fair. FranÃ§ois helped him. He did not. Pay up! Why're you staring at me? Can't you leave me alone? Go away! Go away, or I'll smack you one! Go away! He's never been drunk like this. What'll we do? - I'll make him a good cup of coffee. We'll pour it down his throat... if we have to. C'mon, bet with us. You'll win some dough. FranÃ§ois! Come sit down. How's your car? Fine. How's your girlfriend? Fine. Come, have a good cup of coffee. It'll pick you up. - Leave me alone, Mother. But, EugÃ¨ne... Get out, you bitch! Just leave. Thanks. I don't think Dad'll be going to the plant. He's not feeling so hot. But I can still pick you up tomorrow. Sure. We'll have a coffee and go for a spin. We'll go for a spin. - What time? At 8. I'll be ready. Will you drive us? - Me too! - No, Eva's not a school bus. Did I overdo it last night? No, Dad. You were pretty funny. You could've taken me first. -Why? After the death of LÃ©o Harvey... outside Goldwater and Sons... union leaders promised strikers their help. They hinted they'd throw their support... behind one of the parties when the election campaign... We shouldn't have walked out. Hi. - Hello. We want our jobs! We want our jobs! We want our jobs! Goldwater to the gallows! I'll take a few pictures. - What about classes? Later. - If you're skipping, go get a job. The way things look, we'll need it. You see, EugÃ¨ne... you were wrong to doubt us. We won't let those bastards win. Everyone's behind us. - Not LÃ©o. The guys are sticking together. Strikes never get you anywhere. What's the news on Albert? - He's in jail... charged with involuntary manslaughter. Goddamn boss! It's your fault LÃ©o's dead! Stay on the sidewalk! What about the other photographers? You'll see! - Let him go! Calm down, it's useless. I know. How'd it go? - They'll pay! A night in jail's no big deal. Any union leader... has spent time behind bars. Small consolation. Look, they fucked up my film. Who covered bail? - The union. Mine, too? - No, Pierre paid yours. Who's he? - You'll find out. He wants to meet you. - When's LÃ©o's funeral? Tomorrow at 10. Here, your key. - Thanks. Eat this. It'll do you good. What's it like in prison? I've never been. Is it as filthy as they say? - Mom! Is it true about all the fairies? - Mom! Yeah, we were raped. Goddamn tabloids... FranÃ§ois! - Don't blame others... you should've kept your mouth shut. Let's go! Look who's here. - Who is it? Gendron, an MNA. - Elections, I guess. The flies are out. - At least he named a mediator. After LÃ©o died. Quiet, kid. When we want advice, we'll ask. He'd be alive if we hadn't walked out. Why aren't you on Albert's side? What'd that change? - That kind of attitude... is why you earn $100 a week. That's all you're worth to them. I can't earn $300 a week with my job. Some people have shown up to pay their last respects. Among them are three provincial MNAs... from the Independence Party... alongside two union leaders, which may confirm... rumors we heard last night... they're supporting Mr Lemoine's party. Meanwhile, Goldwater and his gang rake in profits you earned. They can afford whatever they want. Your Dad couldn't run the company. He's worth every bit as much as those damn Americans! He's not guilty of murder! You won't see Albert. He's in jail till tomorrow. Who's he? Pico, the shop steward. Don't be an idiot, Marcel. Everyone knows it was an accident. We've got to keep the men united. Know what your problem is? You're a damn nice guy... but you're yellow, a coward. I couldn't talk like that at home. If only it did some good. Nothing changes, always back to square one. Poor Dad. Would you put your parents in a home? Why? Just wondering. Hug me. We haven't made love in so long. I promise to make up for lost time. Like some coffee? Gimme that. - No way. It was an accident. - Like hell. Gimme it. Why'd you take it away? Accidents happen. We have to move on. Albert better not show up here again. The mediator said: Be patient. Sounds like he's with Goldwater. Out to fill Beaugrand's coffers. Give him a chance, he's new. In 3 months you'll still be picketing. C'mon, we should talk. Coke in the morning? Do you plan to stick with us? School's a waste of time. I'm fed up. I'm real fed up. Are you quitting? What's Goldwater care if we picket his plant? He's got ten others. He's rich, it's nothing to him. We've never even seen him. That's no reason to... - It's a damn good reason. We've decided to have a talk with him. Talk with him? - Yeah. We've had our eye on you. We want you to take photos of that meeting... for the press. We plan to pay Goldwater a little lesson... squeeze him by the balls. That'll shake up his buddies too. Here's Pierre. He's the one who paid your bail. Hi. This is FranÃ§ois. A gutsy kid. Have to stick up for your beliefs. Paul... Marie... FranÃ§ois. Hi. It's not loaded. To scare him and the others. - Where's it from? Pierre has ways. Go change, it's not far. In there? - Yeah. We ready? - The phone's cut... they're all inside. - Marie, keep a look-out. Martin, you come with us. Let's move on to the north sector. Garibaldi? I'll go. Up against the wall! Move it! We're not interested in you. Play along and nothing'll happen. Ok guys, go! Freeze! Which one's Goldwater? - I don't know. Which one is he? He's not here. - Christ! No problem. They'll do just fine. We don't need glamor shots! Why wasn't Goldwater there? He cancelled at the last minute. Give me the film. What for? - Give me the film. It was a big operation. - This'll stir things up good. Finally we did something, not just beg for what we're owed. You can let me off here. What a night. Make sure you tune in to CJMS. GeneviÃ¨ve! What's wrong? - Nothing. Think I'm stupid? Why weren't you in class today? I was taking pictures. What's going on, FranÃ§ois? A special news bulletin. Listen. We've just received the following... unconfirmed report: Five MontrÃ©al political and business leaders... were apparently kidnapped from a country house. We can't reveal their identities. The black-hooded kidnappers... drugged their chauffeurs and housekeepers. Here is the communiquÃ© from the group who kidnapped... Premier Beaugrand's top aide... one of his MNAs and 3 businessmen... linked to his party: '' We're tired... of the reign of psychological terror... waged by big business at election time. As a result we are taking action. More such clean-ups will follow. Signed: The Workers.'' The five men kidnapped by this new movement... called The Workers, are Mr Peter Laxton, 45... Mr Antoine Garibaldi, 48... Peter Malacket, 65... Armand Desrosiers II, 54... I need four rolls. Again? - We're going up north to shoot. And your classes? Forget my classes. Give me six rolls. Will you testify on Albert? I go in next week. - He's in trouble. Poor Albert. Poor Albert? Don't park there! - I'll just be a minute. I hate'em, I hate'em, I hate'em! Anything new? - Seen the paper? These guys are the establishment? Pretty sorry sight. Caught pants down! - Hey, guys! A news bulletin! - Coming? Ok. I won't be long, ok? Did you tell your girlfriend? - No, don't worry. She looks mad. - I hardly see her. We meet Pierre at the country house at 7. The house? - Relax. Just be there. The mediator told me... Goldwater's in Europe for 3 days. Why didn't Pierre know? - No idea. I'll ask him. Get ready. Other cells are preparing for the elections too. It's going to swing, my boy. When a government... instead of solving problems... just dodges them, holding inquiry after inquiry... but never changing anything... it's no surprise, however regrettable... if people lose their heads and commit such acts. Workers won't allow themselves to be abused any longer. FranÃ§ois and Fernand seem close. Fernand loves trouble. He may influence FranÃ§ois. Not really. In these troubled times... which we had predicted... we need a government capable of action... in a province threatened by socialism... and terrorism. Otherwise... there'll be many more such events. Know what Goldwater's profits were last year? $2 million, net. - So what? You talk like my mother. You know it's not just about Goldwater. Seen their communiquÃ©? What'll it change if Lemoine wins the elections? It's all the same gang, the same system. They want change, but people don't care... unless it means more money. Then things'll stay the same. It's you who'll pay. Things'll go on... and nothing will have changed. And as for us... What about your pictures? I'm getting cold. I've no choice, I have to keep going. Otherwise I know... I'll always blame myself. Are you sure you'll succeed in changing something? But if no one tries, nothing will change. You know how far fine speeches get you. You're an idealist. But we need them. I love you. Are you warmer now? Yes. What about the pictures? Are you sure? - Sure. That your car? - Yeah, why? Your papers. Take them out. Do you have papers? What were you doing? Taking pictures of apples. I've something else for you. Are you in? What about Goldwater? We'll forget about him for now. It'd be too risky. We have a bigger fish to fry. Here... Know how to use it? They told me everything I wanted. Look at this. Paul, your info was dead on. The three of them poured a million into Beaugrand's campaign. A million! No wonder they were elected. You can buy a lot of votes. Page 2 is all the bribes they've admitted to so far. Garibaldi defrauded QuÃ©bec out of 3 million in taxes. Can't wait till this gets out! How'd you get them to confess? We'd done our homework. One of them got scared. We'll go through this later. Paul? Here, FranÃ§ois... For the gas. Tonight at 9:30, at this address. A woman will be waiting. Her name's HÃ©lÃ¨ne. She's with us. Paul sent... - Come in, fast! Hurry up, he'll be here any minute. Don't do anything stupid. No heroics. In here. How about that light? Maybe you'd like a row of floods, too? You're a big one. Did Paul tell you who it is? That it's his father? - His father? The Minister of Justice. - Champagne? Careful. Get your money's worth? If you liked the show, thank Paul. He arranged it. - Why? He's consumed by hate, especially for his dad. Why? Why? Why? You ask a lot of questions. Why do you do this? My father was laid off at Goldwater's and... It's too complicated to explain. What's your girlfriend think of this? She doesn't know. I never see her. Is it serious between you? Well... yeah. Is she pretty? - Yes. And you, why do you... Because... I lived with Pierre when he worked for the Union. He did me a huge favor back then. He's always come through. And the photos? - You won't see my face. But Arthur... Champagne? He's no danger to me. I know too much, about both sides. FranÃ§ois, come celebrate with your gran. What is it? Guess. You're pregnant? - No, silly! I just won... $1000 at bingo! - She's lending us $500. At least she's thinking of us. - Don't mind your mom. I was young once, too. Here, have a drink. Here's to Gran's health! A news bulletin! Aren't you celebrating? What's wrong? - It started when Eva said... she'd lend him $500. ...Minister Champagne. - I wish to reassure QuÃ©becers: We've done everything... to ensure no further kidnappings occur. It's about time! - The police are out in full force. I personally promise that the guilty... will be punished severely. Elections will go on as planned. The situation is in hand. FranÃ§ois, for you. - What? The phone! - Who is it? GeneviÃ¨ve. You're in the clouds. I wanted to see you're alright. On the eve of the election campaign... opinion polls show these standings: 23% of voters support... Mr Lemoine's Independence Party. Mr LÃ©ger's party stands at 15%, and Premier Beaugrand's party... has 38%. 24% of voters are undecided. Whose house is this? Why do you ask? - So many people... isn't it risky? - It's Pierre's place. What's his story? Pierre was union chief during the Val d'Or strike. He spent two years in jail. And now? - Now, as you can see... What's the matter, scared? No, that's not it. - The less you know... the less dangerous it is for everyone. I'm no brain... but I figure Pierre's damn good. He knows what he's doing. Your pictures will cause an uproar. Dad'll get what he deserves. Bet you had fun after he left. Surprising. She lays anything in trousers. - Paul! Fernand'll explain our next moves. We'll start our own campaign, like he says. Fear's the only way to get them to listen. My 20 years with unions taught me that. We'll hit them all. Lemoine too? - Yes. Otherwise... it could work against him. He's the best. Another one wants to crap. - Hold on. Come see'em when they're scared and get diarrhea. What's wrong? How cute! He's ashamed to show his teeny weenie! Don't worry, little man, Mom's seen others. Cute, huh? One offered me money... to let him go... lots. He was shocked to learn not everyone can be bought. You'll pay for this! - Before we go to jail... you'll be pushing up daisies! Look at them! Such fine specimens of manhood! I was a social worker for 5 years. I thought I was helping... the so-called '' disadvantaged'' ... giving something to people who needed it. But at a certain point I realized... what I was giving them was so little... it just kept them poor... hanging on the edge of the hole. When we finally managed to get them out... the boss'd come... the loan companies... and shove'em back down. You had to start all over. As time went on, I realized I was keeping them down. You see? I was giving them just enough to survive... so they wouldn't go to the rich and say: I demand a job! I kept them in a state of total dependence. To help, I'd have to say to them: The system's fucked, we have to unite, to change things. I needed to say it, and finally to act on it. The only way, because it was urgent... The only way I found was this. It's violent, real violent. Those pictures of me are lovely. Haven't you had enough? Leave me be! It's becoming a habit. He's worse tonight. This is my house. Don't like it? Leave! EugÃ¨ne, the kids! - This is my place! I'll shout if I want! - The first time it was funny... but not anymore, understand? You won't tell me what to do in my own house! It'd be good for you. Listen to me! I'm your father! I've had it with your damn theories! They're why I lost my job! If you want a fight... fight each other. Let us work! I'm fed up with this stuff... and it's not just me! You'll listen... show some respect! Everything has a limit. That's true. - I'm your father. Lucky for us! - You little bastard! Open up! This isn't over! Open up, you hear? I'll take this. We oppose violence. We believe we can achieve the same results, but democratically! However, we must ask ourselves one very important question: Why do these acts of violence occur? Because people are sick and tired... of laws that protect the rich but never the poor. Of course they say we're idealists... our feet aren't on the ground. But what about their solutions... the realists... who represent the status quo? What have they ever achieved? In the last four years... the government has led us on a frantic race... towards socialism... and these are the results. Government is invading our lives! We live in a police state. Terrorism is flourishing. Our freedom... is being eroded. The election campaign began with all three party leaders calling for calm. According to recent polls no party has a clear lead. Mr Beaugrand must deal with the unrest... despite the loss of his principal organizers, being held hostage. Mr Lemoine has avoided... a radical position, but made only small gains. Mr LÃ©ger is winning over discontented voters. The campaign itself will be decisive. Ladies and gentlemen... ...and we are headed for certain victory! I cannot stand by and refuse to help... my fellow citizens... and even less, use fine words... and fancy phrases to lure you... into the trap of a future that doesn't exist. We've proven our worth. I invite you to follow me higher and further... Please remain calm. The lights will... THE WORKERS Despite their brazen blackmail... a handful of fanatics will not stop us from... If this keeps up... I'll move to Ontario. We've learned that another rally was sabotaged. Terrorists cut the power ending the rally. During the evacuation of the hall... one person was injured and taken to hospital. It's the third meeting sabotaged... tonight. More details... on our 10:30 newscast. Are you guys behind all this? Are you crazy? You'll be arrested... lose everything... - Not so loud. Just wait. Ginette... tell me if there's another news bulletin. I need to know how the others did. In that case... - GeneviÃ¨ve! Take it easy. No way I'll wait for a guy in jail! Stop thinking only of yourself, you sound like Eva. What's up? - Nothing. And you? - His liver... all the booze. It's over. I'll stop drinking. All drunks say that. Bet you he won't. FranÃ§ois... could you sell 50 of these at school? It might help get me elected... '' Queen of the Caps.'' 39 cents each, 3 for a dollar... They're cheap. Be nice to GeneviÃ¨ve. She's a good girl. - Would you please shut up. I know I'm a burden. I just can't imagine going to a home to die. Sorry for calling so late. Could I speak to GeneviÃ¨ve? I think she's sleeping. Could you wake her? - One second. I'm sleeping. - She's sleeping. Tell her I'll pick her up at 9 tomorrow. GeneviÃ¨ve's here. FranÃ§ois, it's GeneviÃ¨ve. They arrested 75 terrorists. No, 75 people, they're not sure who they are. They must've had a reason. My teacher says the government's to blame. Soon we won't speak French. - Teachers ought to teach... not preach politics. What do we do? Can I talk now? Thanks. I want to thank you for your show. I've been trying to call, but it was always busy. When I think about the families of the men... who were captured... It's horrible! The people who do such things are just jealous lazy bums. They don't want to work. I'm hot! The army is assisting the police. As well... the government is offering a $100,000 reward... to anyone who provides information... leading to the terrorists' arrest. We urge... the population to stay calm. The bastards are getting scared. Where's EugÃ¨ne? Haven't seen him lately. He's sick. - Lots of people are sick... all of a sudden. - Well, he's in bed. What's new? - Hardly anybody turns out. The same everywhere. In Lasalle they called off... a one-day solidarity strike. At GS, 3 shops are out. After the bombings, they're going back in. Those bastards! The Workers! The Workers! Hang in, hang in, hang in! The Workers are here! Get away! Guys, clear'em out! You're sure? - I told you. Broads... It's Paul's office. Hi. So, what's new? - The Premier is talking big. I can't wait till your pictures come out. When? - When the time's right. The arrests? Robert was picked up. What do we do? - Pierre says Robert's clean... they're letting him go. - They arrested people at random... we're safe. But Robert's no good to us now. Let's get to work. I have four cars... marked Mondello's Pizzeria. Why's Paul hate his dad so much? It's an old story. Arthur only married Paul's mom for her money. To fund his election bid. He's put her through hell. Paul's waited years to get revenge. And his mom? - She hates the guy too. Biting your nails? No need to worry. I know what's going on from Arthur. Coming? We're paying the price for irresponsible government. You've seen the huge new schools, which our kids feel lost in. Our children don't know which way to turn. All these fancy new programs that lead nowhere.... You've seen the filthy professors... with beards and long hair who teach our kids. Have you heard them preaching Maoism... independence, socialism... and terrorism to your kids? And even sexology? Do you know that many schools... not to mention colleges and universities... are brothels... in everything but name? It's free love... the pill, abortions. We mustn't blame them... our kids, ladies and gentlemen. It's not their fault. It's yours! - But it has to stop! We must rein them in before it's too late. We'll shut schools if necessary. We'll open summer camps... where they'll learn clean living... enjoy sports... - Nudism! ...respect for authority... and above all... relearn the real meaning of values. If Champagne and his corporate chums... hadn't ignored all the problems for 4 years... we wouldn't be in this mess today. To hold us responsible for these events is blatant posturing. When you can't work in your language... and workers are offered no solutions... Let me warn Mr Lemoine to weigh his words. He might find himself behind bars... for inciting civil unrest. Know what those bastards' annual profits are? They're dreamers who'd drag you down a road... where you risk losing what little you have. People aren't stupid. They've seen our results. First they shove socialism at us... then say we need independence, and try and foist it on us. A reactionary dictator won't solve your problems. There's a bomb in the basement of your school. It'll go off in exactly 18 minutes. To save lives, The Workers suggest you clear the hall. I wish I had kids so they'd see this. Why aren't you married? - Dames are nothing but trouble. A good lay now and then is enough. If I had a son, I'd teach him to fight. He'd be someone. Let's call the cops, have a laugh. Officer... The Workers suggest... you evacuate the school where Premier Beaugrand is speaking. A bomb's set to go off in exactly 38 minutes. G'night, officer. I'd give anything to see their faces. No fair, we miss the show. The first one should've gone off. It's me again. How's it going? Champagne, St AndrÃ© School. If you think I'm joking... take the chance. A bomb exploded at Mr Beaugrand's party headquarters. No one was hurt, but the building was severely damaged. No one will attend the rallies now. Don't be stupid, we'll get caught. One more. Hi, how's it going? Takes time to plant them. Mr Gendron, St Antoine School. See you later. Fernand! Last one, I swear. We'll show those bastards! Hello, we just visited your offices. You have 18 minutes. May I suggest you evacuate? Step on it. FranÃ§ois, this is RomÃ©o. Remember him? A bomb killed 3 people in Westmount. From the scene, here are the first shots... of the drama. The circumstances surrounding this tragedy are unclear. This time The Workers do not appear... to have called in a warning... as for the other blasts. The victims' identities... have not been revealed. A bomb was found at the Paul SauvÃ© Arena... but it wasn't wired. Organizers of Mr LÃ©ger's party... wonder how it was placed there... despite the tight security measures... they've established. So I can count on you Thursday? The first round of bingo... will start at about 8. Thanks. Just a second please. For you, it's GeneviÃ¨ve. I'll call back. - He'll call back. She says she has to speak to you now. I'll call back. - Look, he'll call you back... he's busy. Bye. You shouldn't have come. It's too dangerous. Told you not to trust these chickens. You bastard! - Fernand! I know who planted the bomb at the arena... and the one in Westmount. It was on a deserted street, a car went by... as it went off. An accident. We're accomplices in murder. They kill too with their laws... and their thugs. - At building sites... old age homes. - Accidents can happen. When we learn who died, we may be glad. That's right. - We wanted to scare people... not kill them. Count me out. This should be a collective decision. It's too late now. No one can back out. We're all accomplices. Knowing them... they'll turn'em into martyrs, hold a state funeral. We won't just stand by. Panic will spread. The elections may be cancelled. How's that help us? - A good way to topple them. Yeah, but no one will support us now. Worse, LÃ©ger's gaining ground. Ok, enough talk. You'll receive my instructions in 2 days. Fernand, come with me. The rest stay here till noon tomorrow. Careful, they're watching the roads. If there's trouble, you know where I am. If we need, we have the hostages. Armand... I don't know if you're watching, but... if you are, I want you to know... If you can, send word how you are. We're very worried. I hope they haven't hurt you... and that you're healthy. To the kidnappers I say: I understand an unhappy life has made you bitter... but it's not the fault of my husband... and his companions... So, please... if you have a heart... think of their families and kids. Don't harm them. I beg you, let us know... they're alright. Please. Well, guess it's bedtime. Tomorrow's a big day. I love these guys. Such model citizens. What are you thinking? Nothing. You look glum. It's that business in Westmount. Wait to find out who died. Don't shed tears over them. These guys aren't worth it. Know who did it? - I don't want to. In this game... the less you know, the better. What will you do? Go home. No, I mean later. - I don't know. It'll depend on what happens. We don't risk much. I've a bit of money. If we have to, we can always leave. Have you got a passport? Come on... State of emergency. The dead man... killed with the other two was Davidson. The chain store owner. Ladies and gentlemen, what do you want? Peace? Calm? Liberty? Law and order? Is that what you want? You'll have it! Poor man! - What do you know? Go back to your bingo! - FranÃ§ois! Thousands die every week in the world, no one cares. Not the same. They were murdered. Accidents can happen. Maybe they died for a reason. Forget it. - You can be so stupid sometimes. Forget it. When LÃ©ger's elected... you'll see, things'll change. There'll be peace. Those who claim we're fascists are wrong. But we'll do whatever's necessary... to restore peace here in our families... in our homes. I know... I know, ladies and gentlemen... people will say I'm a Mussolini, a Hitler. That's ok, I can take it. That's not important. What's important is you... It's you and me, and all of us together... who want to restore peace... who want to live here the way we like. Don't you see? He's a maniac, a bandit! He kept quiet when the crime inquiry investigated politicians. He was scared he'd be implicated. FranÃ§ois, how can you? You're nothing but ignorant slobs! Ladies and gentlemen to restore this peace... this dignity we all long for... Don't be angry at him. To end the years of unrest we've seen... you have no alternative but to vote for us! A vote for us is a vote for you! On the 25th... it's you, ladies and gentlemen... who will decide what you want. Starting the 25th, you will be in power. It will be power of the people... and power to the people! Bernard LÃ©ger! Bernard LÃ©ger! Hurrah, hurrah! Bernard LÃ©ger is there! Did you hear? - What, the polls? Yeah, that scum LÃ©ger is leading. I've got news for him. More posters. Drop me at the hotel. - What for? No reason. - Jeez. Let me out. - But why? His rally's ending. I have something to do. What's that? - A press card... from my days on the union paper. I'll finally use it. Whatever happens... don't let anyone push you around. What'll happen? I have a surprise for you all. Did Pierre... - No, it's my idea. Pierre's much too... Mr Beaugrand called... an emergency meeting after the blast... that killed 3 people. The funerals take place tomorrow. At a press conference... the Premier categorically ruled out... cancelling or delaying the elections. Mr Beaugrand's election bid... hampered by the loss of his two top aides... is trailing. The Premier refused to answer reporters' questions... about the photo posted today showing Minister of Justice... Champagne in a highly compromising position. The man gaining from the situation is Mr LÃ©ger... according to polls. This is Jacques Trudel... at the HÃ´tel Bonaventure. No, I repeat, we won't cancel the elections. The photo is a set-up, a travesty! We won't yield to blackmail by a few terrorists. Fernand's dead. Come in. Pierre... the phone for you. I suppose you've seen the posters. Like some coffee? This Pierre's place? No, he just rented it. What's wrong? - Fernand's dead. Yes. He ruined everything. Ok, FranÃ§ois, I think... you've understood. We take a break for three days. Everyone lies low. No phone calls. I'll call you. Can't we take him? HÃ©lÃ¨ne, come on! Are you leaving? Central America. What for? Just to be safe. For a few weeks... till things quiet down. Then we'll come back. We'll keep going. We must keep going. Wait here. Lapointe, please. Pierre, don't. - I warned you, no emotions. But we're leaving. No way I'm going to jail. I want to end my days in peace. - Yeah, right. Lapointe? That kid FranÃ§ois is here. No, but he knows too much. Good. I won't forget you. Hurry, pack your bag! Bingo! You have to fill the card. You have to fill it all. It's not rigged. I-22. O-74. Fernand's dead. I know. - Two terrorists also died. A Marie TrÃ©panier and Paul Champagne... the Minister's son. A policeman was wounded. Can I help? FranÃ§ois! There's a place free. And a pretty young girl, just look! Don't worry, I won't tell GeneviÃ¨ve! Ok, ok, I'm going. Did GeneviÃ¨ve call? Get out! Get out! Beat it, all of you! Get out, you dumb broads. I was waiting. - Are you alone? Yeah, they're out. GeneviÃ¨ve... something just doesn't add up. He hasn't been here in 2 days. Think I'm stupid? - He hasn't been here! Lapointe! He was just here. How long ago? - 10, maybe 15 minutes. Where'd he go? - I don't know. Wait, to his girlfriend's, I think. You and Tremblay, stay put. The others, with me. It can't be true. EugÃ¨ne... I can't bear it. Yes, you can. Be strong. Eva... I want you out by tomorrow. One of my uncles... lives out in St Joseph. It's completely isolated. I love you. Turn around! You'll pay for those murders! She's innocent. - Quiet, you'll talk later! She had nothing to do with it! Take her in. Stop, I'll shoot! VICTORY FOR LÃ‰GER TWO-SEAT MAJORITY Peace has been restored. Goldwater shares are up. EugÃ¨ne works for the union now. The terrorists are still in jail, awaiting trial. And Bernard LÃ©ger, after months of work... is taking his first vacation. As for these photos...
