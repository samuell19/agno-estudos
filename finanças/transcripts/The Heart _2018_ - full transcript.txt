I thought it sounded naive when people talked about love. Early on, my friends and I saw how our moms were more responsible than our dads. So what's the point of love in an unequal society? I liked sex. I listened to Lil' Kim and watched "Sex & the City" way before I ever had sex myself. Samantha was my idol. The worst thing I could imagine was being "the sad girlfriend", a "refrigerator girl". Freedom was everything to me. It's your turn, Mika. But I don't masturbate. - Of course you do! - Everybody masturbates. - It's nothing to be ashamed of. - I'm not ashamed, I just don't do it. - Please, of course you do. - What are you afraid of'? I'm not afraid of anything! I can touch myself if I'm sexting or having phone sex. But getting off by myself... I just can't see the point. - If I want to orgasm, I have sex. - But It's not the same thing. Sex with a partner is sharing something with them. Masturbation, you do for you. But sex doesn't have to be this super-romantic moment. It can be like...a work-out. What'? Seriously! You're both like: "I wanna come!" And bam, bam, bam, you do... - I've got a lighter... - Thanks. - Photography, huh? - That's right. But I might drop out... These parties are killing me. - That's your reason? - For a whole year? Come on! - Nobody dances! - True. And the only good music tonight was when you plugged in your phone. - Really? - Yeah, you have great taste. - I'm a music student, so I should know. - I'm honored, thank you. Shit, looks like everyone's leaving... I'd better be going too. Want to come to my room'? What'? I need to get up early tomorrow. - I should have left ages ago. - I see... Are you sure'? No, I'm not. But it's only one week into the semester and I'm trying to not fuck school up. I get it. - It was great talking to you. - Likewise... Good luck with the after-party. ART SCHOOL - Thank you... - You're welcome. - Call you later'? - Sure. People talk about downtown Stockholm... It's not like you're entitled to live at a prime location. Why live downtown at all? The outskirts are much nicer. I lived 30 minutes from the city center, and there were trees and nice shops... Then go live out in the woods! - That's not what this is about. - Isn't it'? - No, I'm talking about equal rights. - It's not a right. What if we passed laws about where people could live? - We'd end up like Cuba or China... - Please! - So, where do you live? - Downtown. - Why is that an issue? - How did you get your flat'? - My father bought it for me. - You live in a flat your dad bought? - Dad worked hard all his life to give... - It's impossible to talk to you. My dad's worked hard all his life too... We hang out all the time, but we're just friends. I have sex with a classmate instead. That spring, I lost my keys and you invited me over for dinner... - Anyone else around? - Not really... Do you like pizza? Good. Go ahead and put on some music... - Need any help? - Nah, It's just a microwave pizza. - Do you like oregano? - Yeah. - You okay? - Yeah, I was pretty hungry. - Hang on, I've got to tell you something. - I'm sorry. This was a bad idea... - A really bad idea. - What do you mean? We're friends and this could really screw things up. - I get it. - That's so not what I was going to say. L'm having my period, that's all. I see. Okay... I didn't want to freak you out. Is it a problem? No, not to me. What about you'? I've been waiting forever for this kiss... Will you be working in Gothenburg all summer'? Yeah... It was great getting to know you. Is this, like, the last time we'll ever see each other? You could come up to Stockholm, you know. Would you like me to'? Then maybe I will. Bye. THE HEART - Dad, please... - Right... Yeah... - Could I crash on the couch'? - One night, then I'll sort this out. - How long has it been like this? - It's been... Don't worry, I'll take care of it. - Holy shit... - I've got it. No, I'll do it You go to an academy in Stockholm and I work in Gothenburg. We spend hours on Facetime and it's so hard to hang up... I tell you that I'm not into relationships. You don't care about the future, you say, you just want to be with me. Listen, you won't believe what happened today! L'd forgotten about my appointment to get a wax. And there I was, dressed in a jumpsuit! So I had to strip naked. I draped a towel over me... We talk and she starts to apply the wax... Gimme a light... And then the girl asks me where I'm from. I say Bergsjon, but that l live in Vasastan these days. She makes this face and rips off the wax. "So you've moved up in society?" "It's not what you think, my boyfriend owns an apartment there." She goes "I see", and rips off the next strip. It hurt like hell! L'm lying there, all sweaty... And here she is, drawing all the wrong conclusions. But then again, I do live in a fancy part of town with my boyfriend. Get out of the kitchen, people! Mika, I have to say... - I felt so far away from my roots. - I understand. Our parents were genuine left-wingers and we're just faking it... You're peeing on your jacket! 7:30 tonight. Be on time. - Hi. - Hi. - So, how was the trip? - Fine. How are you? - Are you nervous? - Stressed-out, mainly. - Want to grab some food'? - Sure. That was awesome! - Bro! - What a performer! - You can take credit for that. - No way, you really delivered. - You look great. - So do you. - This is Mika. - Hi. - You were fantastic. - Thank you. - This is my old friend, Tony. - Hi, Tony. - Are you into music too'? - No. - Mika's a photographer. - A photographer? - Is this, like, your girlfriend'? - No, we're just friends. - How long have you been producing'? - This is my first, like, "grownup" project. - I've been fooling around a while... - There's more to come! Hang on... - I need to tell you something. - So, shoot... You might end up hating me now, but... A few days ago, I slept with this guy... It didn't mean a thing, it was totally random. But the thing is that l.'.. I couldn't stop thinking about you. For real. And there was nothing wrong with him, but I just don't want to... ...be close to anybody but you. I've never felt like this before. Who else on the planet would say they wanted to get serious by confessing that they'd slept with someone else? I'm sorry... You're such a tornado. I don't want to be a tornado. What do you want to be'? Your girlfriend. - For real? - Yes. I want you to be inside of me, always. I want to be inside of you, always. When I get to the top... ...just lift your end up. One, two... Holy shit... I'm never going to move out. Then we'll have to repaint the living room. - What'? - We need to repaint the living room. If we're going to stay here for the rest of our lives. We will surrender to the circumstances. - We're out of cheese again! - I know, but there's a tomato. - Like what's that good for? - Mash it on your sandwich. - You look pretty... - Thank you. So you like it, huh'? - Is that new'? - Yeah. - You like it'? - Very nice. Hello... Right... Hang on. No, I'm still at home. - So, are you a member'? - No, and I don't want to be one. - Thank god, it's Friday! - What are you doing this weekend? I'm going to an art gallery, a friend of mine has a show. Well, I'm going out, that's all I know. There's so much going on. One friend's playing at Tradgarn. Another one has a gig at Berns... Plus I kind of promised to go to this party... Just too much going on. - What about you'? - Not sure. I'd like to go out... ...but I don't really know my way around Stockholm yet. Yeah. And besides, what's to know? - Right, I don't go out anymore. - No... And if you're going to work all weekend, it could be nice to chill out at home. Fucking zombies... Here we go. Is that your stomach rumbling? Hi-.- - Babe? - Yeah? - Could you turn out the lights? - Sure... 'Night... Sweet dreams... What'? - Sweet dreams. - You too. Good night. This is full of paint... Do you need a hand? Let's check over here. Mind your head. - Some tea for you, Tesfay. - You're the best! - Siri, where are the butter knives? - Top drawer. - Is this all you have'? - Sandwich spread, yes. - You didn't buy lactose-free spread? - No. Then we'll have this. - Isn't that good enough? - Don't be offended, I was only asking. Right, I'll take care of the shopping then. - Weren't you going to babysit? - I'll bring the kids. - I'll do the shopping. - No, I'll do it. I think It's better if do the shopping and you go swimming. - That sounds great. - We'll swim after the shopping. Like we said yesterday, Tesfay and I can do it. Right, Tesfay'? We'll take the kids and we'll go swimming. No problem... - ls my family a pain'? - No, this is great. Your mother's a real matriarch. You're the only person I know whose parents are still married to each other. I used to think my parents' life was boring. But now I see how much they enjoy each other's company. I love you. I love you too. Babe... Want me to stop'? Yeah... I need to go to the bathroom. "Because my girlfriend's too pushy." "Because I don't want to disappoint her" "Why does my boyfriend have a low sex drive?" You know... Are we going to talk about this or what'? What do you mean? It feels... It's like you don't want to have sex with me. No, that's not true. - It's been a while... - I just don't think about sex like that. It's not as important to me. Maybe that's it, but... Seriously, is it something I did? - Is living together a problem? - No... I don't know what to say. It's not anything you do wrong, it's just... It's not exciting when you're always up for it. What the hell? You want me to play hard-to-get? You want to fuck me while I'm asleep, or what'? No. I take that back. It was just... I didn't mean it like that. - I didn't... - Yes, you did. A little bit. - I can play submissive. - No... I didn't mean it like that at all. It's just a phase. Hey! Great to see you! - How are you, man? - Fine. Cool... - What are you up to'? - Showing Mika the studio. - The studio? Ay, ay, ay... - Mr. Romantico! - This is Mika. - We've met, haven't we'? Didn't recognize you in that outfit. I caught your show, by the way. Your photos were awesome! You're a genius. - Great stuff! - You really think so'? - Maybe you could shoot my cover pics'? - Sounds great! - Mika! -|-m - Want to smoke? - Later. Are you seeing someone else? Hello? No. Well, are you in love with someone else? Someone at school? Hey, you were the one twerking around all night! - I might as well sleep with somebody. - Well, go ahead. Know what would be nice? That you go on to that after-party, so I can go home and get some sleep. Really? Well, thanks for telling me now. Hang on! Mika, wait! - Let go! - I'm sorry. Come on, please. Let's go home. Why'? So you can turn your back to me in bed? I love you, Mika. Seriously, you mean the world to me. Nothing means more to me. You're the most important person in my life. But It's not enough... That's like being your mom. - You're not attracted to me. - Of course I am! Why wouldn't I be'? You're gorgeous! Then why won't you fuck me'? - Go down on me? Hold me? - This is a fucking joke! Thank you. Here's a bucket. - L'm sorry... - It's okay. You're so kind... Does that hurt'? This is why you should get dreads... Less fuss. Like you don't fuss? Not as often. - Could you help me out'? - Want me to do everything for you'? - Yes, feel sorry for me. - You're just hung-over. "Feel sorry for me"... You look like something out of an 80s soap opera... This will be rough... Don't stop... Listen... I know the timing's weird... ...but I'd like us to talk... ...about this. I'm just tired, that's all. I'm tired too. Everybody's tired, it's fucking winter... I lie awake almost every night. Every time I walk in here, It's like: He doesn't want me around. It's like it bothers you to even see me. That's not true. - This always happens... - What do you mean? Practically everything that really matters to me... ...l end up destroying. What do you mean? I'm like some kind of reverse King Midas. I turn gold into shit. Not just when it comes to you... I do it to us, but also to... ...to school and my music... It's like you trip yourself up, you know. You say no to everything I suggest. You say you need to focus on your music, but all I see you do is gaming. I know... It's not like I haven't tried to do something about it. I'm exhausted after school. I don't want to do a thing. I just want to... I want to disappear. But It's nothing you can understand, everything you do turns out great. What'? You can't say that. What is it I do'? Sell clothes? You are insanely talented. You... But you go to this weird school, where the others are posers. That's why they get work. You're really talented. Your music moves me... You think I'm better than I am. That's what this is all about. You're finding out that this is not what you thought it was. That's what keeps you up at night. You're realizing... No. I know who you are. Don't say things like that. You deserve better. You deserve to be... - ...appreciated. - I want to be with you. I want to be happy with you. You shouldn't be with me, Mika. Then you'll never be happy. I can't even take care of myself... - I'm so tired... - I understand. All I do is let everybody down... That's not true. You make me so happy, can't you see that'? Everything will be all right. If you only knew how much I love you... I love you so much, it's killing me. What? Mika! - Hi! - Look at you, eating outdoors. - Stuffing my face... - It's been ages. - We just had brunch, we're hung-over. - Worth it, though, right'? What are you up to tonight'? Not a clue... - We have a gig at Berns. - Cool! - Want to come'? - Sounds fun... - Listen, baby... - Yeah? - What do you want to do tonight? - What do you want to do'? Well, it might be fun to go out... - You want to go out'? - Maybe... - Where do you want to go'? - We're on the guest list at Berns. - At Berns? Who's playing'? - Some friends from Gothenburg. Or do you have other plans? - I bought this new game. - Okay... What game? It's a remake of a game I played as a kid. - Basically, you shoot Nazis. - No way! Show me. The train platform... And then shoot those guys. Shoot... There... SECOND ANNIVERSARY No... Mom? How do you get therapy? Do you always have to pay'? You can't get free therapy these days unless you're in very bad shape. How does an ordinary person get help? People in Stockholm do it. They pay- And It's very expensive. - Besides, I don't know if it even helps. - What do you mean? All you do is ramble on about things... So, what's wrong'? I don't know. Nothing... Nothing? So what would you talk to a therapist about'? Yeah... Okay... I don't sleep well and things are bad between me and Tesfay. Define "bad". Well, I figured it was his problem. He avoids things. Acts strange. But then he said, and I think there's something to it, that I need a lot of validation. And that I overthink... - Let's try to get this downstairs. - Sure. Do I grab this end, or what'? - The bottom part first? - That's right... I'll give it a kick... Do I sound like a spoiled brat? That has nothing to do with it. But it's not like you have kids together, so... I think he's very sweet. He's got great hair. But I don't think you should waste time and money on therapy. I just don't. You go first. This really pisses me off... Its so damn typical that the woman assumes that she needs therapy! When it generally is the man who has issues. - It pisses me off! - Don't shout. But I'm angry! Hello! - Hi... - Hi. - How are you doing'? - Fine. You'? - Is there something wrong'? - No, I'm just gaming. Thanks for doing the dishes. Right... You're welcome. What are you doing'? - Mika... - Let go! Why are you so angry? What's your problem? Stop packing! Could you stop'? Babe, I'm sorry. Okay? You don't even look at me when I get home. You don't even look up and say hi. - Sweetheart, I'm sorry. - I don't care if you're sorry. - I apologize, it wasn't about you. - That doesn't even matter. It doesn't matter that you leave the dishes, either. None of that matters... I get it, I really do... Break up with me, it would be kinder. There's nothing about me you like. You hate me. You... - You're the last person I'd hate... - Stop it! Just leave me alone. Leave the room. - Stay, please stay. Please? - Go away. You're always in my thoughts... It's so humiliating... I have fun things to do, you know'? I know. You see... - I'm so sorry. - I can't take any more! Things will get better. It won't... Come here... Please. I love you. I'll get my act together and things will get better. L'll do the dishes and make some dinner. Do you hate me'? That was my line... I'm so sorry. - Want to go for a swim? - In this weather? Come on, it's really hot. So m... - I don't feel like it. - Please? - It's such a nice day. - Some other time... - If you want to go, then go. - Right, I'll go. Hi-.- - Where have you been? - Out. - I was worried. - Really? - How are you'? - Fine. But we need to talk. Okay... I'll just have a smoke. Whatever happened to us growing old together? Whatever happened to sitting on the porch listening to music together? Spending the rest of our lives together? - What a shame. - What'? I like Tesfay. Sum. May I be excused? - What are you going to do'? - Play a video game. For a little while. Too bad... THE VOID You wanna hook up with another ten, but Bella has so much more! Did you seriously think she'd go for some redneck? L'll keep my opinion to myself... I don't dislike Emily, but she's a drama queen... She should throw that creep out... She deserves somebody so much better than him. You are such an asshole when you drink! Get out of here! You're useless! Hello? - L'll be right with you. - Good. - Hi... - Hello, sweetheart. Oh, honey! Come on... Now that we broke up, he's happy. He's like a new human being. Out with friends, going to festivals... You're doing it again. Stay away from social media! "No contact" is the only way. Don't call or message him. - Why doesn't he miss me'? - I'm sure he does. He just can't let you know that. Why are we talking about him'? Why aren't we focusing on your life'? - Because I have no life. - What a load of crap! You're young, attractive, talented, creative... You have a job. You have friends, don't you? Call them. Go on a trip, get away! I'll lend you the money. Look at them, Mika, they're hot! That one... - He's mine, you take the other guy. - He wouldn't want to sleep with me. Come on... You could definitely pull either of them, or both! - Are you still seeing Tesfay'? - No. - Are you sleeping together? - No. Not at all. How long has it been? Well, we didn't have sex. - At the end, you mean? - No, as in "at all". - What'? - Yes... Only when he wanted to, which was basically never. What was his problem? Noway... Have you had sex since then'? - You really should, Mika. - Yeah! It's like I can't do it“. It feels like... Like I don't know how anymore. And I don't want to be with any other guy. You know what'? Your pussy is depressed. You just need to get laid. Even if you don't feel the urge, just do it. Get it out of the way. Just sleep with someone, then there will be an ocean of opportunities. Just get it out of the way. Him'? - I think I'll stay in tonight. - What's up'? I have a stomach ache and I feel... ...all bloated... No way! - You're faking it. I know that face! - No. Yes, you are... What's the matter? I really don't feel like it. Putting on makeup... Everybody else looks so good... Who cares'? Go as you are. - No, I can't. - Why not'? - Look at me! - You look great. - I look like your little dog, or something. - Please... - You guys look great... - I brought loads of stuff. - Borrow something. - Check my bags too. Where's Daphne? Gone with some guy... He's flying home in two hours, so she'll be back soon. Classic Daphne! - What do I do with this? - Bottoms up. So now you're mixing drinks? Straight up vodka, huh'? Oh, I love this! Get those shoes off... - Hello. Water, please... - Carbonated'? - Dinner date with that Italian guy? - Yeah. Is he wearing a neck brace? I'm going to be alone for the rest of my life... Why didn't you make an effort'? Why didn't you fight for us'? I picture you making love to someone else. That you're tender and sweet to her, like you were with me at first. L'm so pathetic... I'm still in love with you. I know I don't want to go back to what we had, but I want you to be mine. Let me check your teeth. Okay... That was one hell of a fall! Oh, honey... Let's see if Mika's awake... - I found them... - Good. Let's go out. Could you take her? We need to go and pee. What pretty shoes... - Here they are. - Good... Cradle her head. Careful... She likes a firm hand. Stroke her face like this... STOCKHOLM revisited Something I'd forgotten about is back again. A kind of buzz. I like my body again. I've sold some of my photos and we're both invited to the same party. Hi! Hi. Thanks. - Hi, how are you? - Great. Hello! - You found it'? - Yes, but it took a while... It was in the grass. Mika, this is Nadja. And Ms is... - Nicole. - Wow, you remembered! - Hi! You look great. - Thank you. - So do you. - This actually belongs to Nadja. - What are you up to'? - Just chilling here. We went to this launch... - Smell this! - It's hipster beer. I can't remember! I'm drunk, can you tell'? My eyes get so red... I wanted to see this guy and texted him. But he hasn't texted me back, so I don't know... - Hey, I just need to do something... - Come back when you're done. Is there something going on'? I've seen her on your lnstagram. We're just friends. We're... We're... There was this one night where we were on the verge, but... She isn't really my type. What? She's gorgeous! Yeah, but she's so... ..."together". And fit. Not like I'm comparing myself, or anything... ...but I can't handle it right now. What about you'? Are you seeing anyone? I know this will sound cheesy... “but nothing compares to you. The same goes for you. It's good to see you. - How about we share a taxi? - The Metro is right here. No, I'm too tired for the Metro... I don't want to! - I can't take it... - Lazybones! - Can I crash at your place? - At my place? Hang on, why would you do that'? - Why stay at my place? - It's nice to hang out. - Don't you have a place to stay? - Sure. - L'd already decided... - What'? To not sleep together. What's the harm of sleeping together? - You know what will happen. - No. What's going to happen? Damn it... Could you tell me what's on your mind? I mean, It's a major diss to me. This is exactly what I mean. I'm glad I said no. Now everything is like it used to be. What do you mean? It's not like we're fighting now. - How about breakfast tomorrow'? - Why'? You're staying so close by. - It might be nice. - Not really. Good night. It was fun... Mind the gap... Oh, no... - Hello. - Hi... - What are you doing'? - Sleeping. This might sound like a lie, but I can't find my key. And I don't have the right pass code. I've been here a while. And no one else is entering or leaving the building... Sorry, I didn't know who else to call. All right, come on over. Just hurry up, okay? Hello? - Hi... - It was so bright out there. Listen... Would it be weird if we had sex now? Yes. I think it would be. Good... I didn't really want to anyway. LOVE YOU Hello? Hi-.- - How are things? - Fine. You'? Fine. I'm at the parking lot by my parents' place. - What's up with that? -l'm on my way to see them. - Do you have a few minutes? - Sure... I can't stop thinking about you. - About us. - Okay... It's, like, all I can think about... I'm still in love with you. Hello? I've changed, I've been doing a lot of thinking. Could we meet up'? I brought some stuff for you... - Just stuff you left behind. - Thank you. Mainly clothes and so on... What's this? Oh.“ That's when I bought my new camera. - Nice... You don't want any'? - I've kept a few. - Tell me about work. - It's going well. Rs busy... But the best part... 'his when they're not around. I get to be there as late as I want and I can do my own projects. I can really picture you dancing around the studio. Singing»- - Don't laugh... - Why not'? It hurts... - So how are you'? - All right... - Lots of music. - What kind of projects? - I've got a studio too. - Cool! That's nice, and I have this new project... - Lots of trouble too. - Like what? I found this young guy with one hell of a voice... So talented. But I can't get him into the studio. We set something up and he's like: "Sorry, I forgot." - Spends his days playing on his X-box. - Right... Karma bites back. So I'm guessing... ...that you don't want to give this another shot'? No. I'm sorry, but... I can't. - I tried so hard. - I know. L'm glad you did. -L'm really proud of you, too. - Why'? You're doing so well. It's just that I can't stop thinking about you. I miss you so much. I miss you too, but... I love you. I love you. Goodbye.
