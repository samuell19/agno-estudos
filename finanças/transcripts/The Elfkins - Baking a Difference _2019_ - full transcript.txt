Does everyone have turnip chips? THE RETURN OF THE ELFKINS Be quiet! That was my foot! I can't wait to see this. It's starting. Welcome, dear friends, to this year's Elfkin Festival. Like every year, the first performance will be... Vendla! Could we wait just a moment? Elfie is missing. We'll start without her. We're about to hear the famous legend of our ancestors: the Elfkins of Cologne! In old Cologne, in times long gone, the Elfkins helped things move along. The lazy man would think it best to just lie down and get some rest. Then late at night... Dratted hat! I can't see a thing. Sorry! I just wanted to check our set. The show will go on in a moment. Where was I? "Then late at night..." Then late at night they would appear and start their secret work with cheer. They swarmed around with tools in hand And combed and cawed and sewed and sawed. The lazy bones, back on his feet, would find his daily work complete! It's a lovely story. But does it have a happy ending? No! One day, a tailor found himself in a plight: Finish the mayor's frock overnight. They crept up to the sewing stand and cut and darned and sewed by hand. Backstitch, topstitch, slipstitch... Before the tailor had finished dreaming, the frock was ready, neat and gleaming. It's trendy. People wear it like this now. But the hard-working Elfkins were never properly thanked. Enter Kipp. Big hat, tiny brain. The nosy tailor's wife wanted to see the helpers with her own eyes, so she scattered peas across the floor. Poor, tireless Elfkins. They stumbled, slipped and crashed down the basement stairs. No one ever saw them again. The humans haven't stopped complaining since: "We'd turn back time if we only could." But those carefree days are gone for good. The script says you fall down the steps too. Over my dead body. Missed me, dummy! Unbelievable! Just you wait. I've had enough. No panties. You show her, Elfie! That's all you've got? Attack! Looks like she needs a hand. I'm the hero of this story! Not this time. Now listen up: Elfkins can't be pushed around. Be nice to us, and we'll be nice back. Well said! That's nothing to applaud. Humans are simply unkind. How do you know? You've never met one. But I know the legend. Humans are mean and ungrateful. And much too big. For generations, we've lived in peace down here. True, but it's gloomy and snoring-boring. And cramped. - No, it's not. I like it here. Vendla's right, Elfie. Everyone here can fulfill the Elfkin mission their own way. And what's our mission? Mastering a handicraft. Which handicraft have you mastered? You'll see! This year, I'll win something in the Hat Competition. Your attempts at learning a craft have failed miserably so far. That's why your hat is the smallest and tattiest of all. That's not going to change. It will soon, because my ideas are Elfienesque! And now to the highlight of our celebration: The Hat Competition. You can pack up your things. I'm getting the hat. I think Urgi will win. Alfy made a toothbrush that's also a shoe brush. But that's pointless. So, what do we have here? A turnip basket. Very good. I dyed them mud brown so you can't see the dirt. What a practical idea, Ada. Ouch! Hats above! - Very nice. Kipp, what have you made this time? A chair. Nicely done. The woodworking is perfect. It's no ordinary chair. The legs are the best part. Now matter how low the ceiling, you can sit in total comfort. Wow. Amazing! A brilliant idea, Kipp! A wonderful example of Elfkin craftsmanship. Wait until you see this. Presenting the one and only Elfienesque turnip harvester. No more harvesting stupid turnips by hand. It'll never work, that's obvious. It's knocked your hats off, right? Quick, out of the way! - Hats above! This wasn't part of the plan. Go away! It could have been worse. We're fine. Help. Help! - It's Vendla. Are you okay, Vendla? Nothing is okay. We may be safe from humans down here, but she's a danger to us all. I'm really sorry. I just thought we could... -...make things "Elfier" down here! It's less Elfie we need! I just wanted to... You'll never be a true Elfkin. But... Where are you going? I'm going up to the humans. Are you crazy? Vendla says humans eat Elfkins for breakfast. They even eat the hats. It's not normal. I don't think they're really that bad, Buck. Take a look. They're the best of friends. I'm going to find a human to teach me a craft. When I come back, I won't be a useless Elfkin with a tiny hat. But what will I do without you? I'll be back really soon. Elfkins are swift, smart and swoosh, right? Exactly! Swoosh! What does that mean? We do our work in a heartbeat, and before they know it, we're gone. There's nothing we can't do! Well, almost nothing. It's my masterpiece. I think I should come along. But you already have a craft. It's boring making candles all day. I want to see the sun. It's brighter than all candles put together. - Oh, Buck! I didn't think the human world would be this beautiful. How big do you think it is? If you ask me, about 100 times bigger than ours. Don't exaggerate! When the sun shines, it's even bigger. It makes everything on Earth grow. Is that why humans are so big? Hey, that's against the rules. It's you! - Come with me. Let me go. We have to go back before the humans see us. So go. I have something to take care of. She's learning a craft from the humans. I'll be back soon. Tell the others I say hello. Are you out of your mind? Humans are sneaky and lazy. You can't learn anything from them. Hey! Can anyone hear me? I'm out here, but it's not my fault. The sun! Have I grown yet? Look. A real bird. Flying must be amazing. There's a huge one letting off a giant fart. Elfie, look at this. What is it? It's where humans keep their food. They really do live in paradise. Hello! Can anyone hear me? It can't get any worse than this. A pig-dog! Kipp? Wrong way! What's that? Looks delicious. What do we do now? Which way? - Away from the pig-dog. Bye! Bad dog! What can he possibly want from us? What now? Do something! He won't hurt us. He just wants to play. Are you sure? - Hold on. That Way! Fetch! This is what she calls an Elfienesque idea? Happy birthday to me Happy birthday to me Happy birthday, dear Theo, Happy birthday... To make your day bright and nice, come to Bruno's cake paradise. As if! Try "cake hell." Hello! Didn't this used to be Hampus Bakery? I remember it differently. Me too. It's been closed for a while now. - Oh, no! Those legendary cream spires! I loved them. I practically lived off them. Stay there. To make your day bright and nice, come to Bruno's cake... Lovely! Just pop it in with Bruno's cakes. How dare you? - Go back to Bruno's. No wonder you're bankrupt! - You old bag. The coast is clear. Let go, you baby giant. Too bad. That was yummy. Not again. Catch me if you can! Head for the bush. Scram, mutt. This isn't your yard. That was close! Over there. Follow me. Great! Breaking and entering. This isn't good! Stupid mutt. We'll be safe in here. What if he does the same to us? He won't. Elfie knows a thing or two about humans. Right? This looks like a kind of a workshop. It's a bakery. A bakery? As in... cakes? Look at that. Humans have a Hat Competition too. But it's broken. Typical. Humans always destroy everything. Look at that! Yummy. Cream hats. Brilliant! Scram! Oh, no, you don't. Stupid mutt! Tasty. Now I know what I want to be. A pastry chef! Then I'll win a big hat like that too. YOU? That'll be the day. Well, maybe you can explain why a pea-brain like you needs such a huge hat. Very funny. What the heck is going on here? Just what I need. Rats. Just you wait. I'll show you who's boss. What did you say? "We'll be safe in here?" Stop trembling! - I'm not. It's just my body shaking. Get down! GOt you! I can't breathe. What are you? What do I look like? A garden gnome? No. You get one more shot. Maybe a... uh... Do I look like an "uh" to you? Fine. I'll help you out, just this once. I'm an Elf... - What? No, that's impossible. An Elf... - An elf fairy? "Fairy"? I'm an Elfkin! But... Elfkins and fairies don't exist. You can't be real. Let her go, or you'll see how real we are. We have a match, and we're not afraid to use it. You'd better not. I'm fond of my bakery, not to mention my... Who did this? Not me! I've never eaten anything that tasty. How did you make it? Oh, that? None of your business. Come on! Don't be like that, Mr. Potato Nose. What's your name, anyway? I'm Elfie. This is Buck, and the pea-brain over there is Kipp. I'm Theo. Theo Hampus. Now that we're acquainted, I have a question, from Elfkin to human Don't touch a thing. And don't make a peep. Did you do that to Charles? Hello! You and your cream tart have three seconds before I throw you out. Wrong. I'm throwing you out. You've been broke for ages. Because people only buy your cheap gobstoppers. Better than your dusty old creations. - Not again. You have no idea. - No, you have no idea. No, you. - No... Try this. Take that, wannabe genius. You pathetic show-off. - Miserable sourpuss! Pompous jelly-belly! Hey! Not the cupcakes. Buck! You're the expert on humans. He fights with everyone... But the sourpuss can bake better than the jelly-belly. Get off me. - Do you give up? No! Never! On the topic of giving up, can I remind you why we're here? What'? Oh, right. What's this? A detailed list of your unpaid bills. Electricity, gas, water... Let's cut to the chase. I settled your debts. You have one week to pay me back. If you don't, the place is mine and you can pack your bags. What? Oh yes, and happy birthday, brother dearest. It's worse than I thought. You really should have told us. Happy birthday and a hat full of joy Happy birthday, may you get a new toy... My home. No reason to lose your hat. If you just bake a bunch of cakes, you'll have more money than you know what to do with. I guess I can go pack my bags. There goes your pastry chef dream. So we can finally go back home. No, wait! I can help you. We can all help you. We're Elfkins, after all. We work night and day, and in between too. Don't worry, we'll use our Elfkin magic. You've just got to teach me to bake. You don't know how to bake? No, but it can't be that difficult. Let's get this lesson underway. I'll turn the oven on. Elfie knows what she's doing. Or maybe not! I'll put that out in the drop of a hat. "Gasoline"? Never heard of it. Stop! Yet another problem solved. And so swooshily, or whatever that word is. Believe it or not, we Elfkins are really handy to have around. If we're treated well. This is terrible treatment. I'm sorry. I'll make it up to you. How? You just torched his baking supplies. Don't miss our sale on plums today. If I get him new ingredients, he won't be angry anymore. It's teeming with humans! Your idea is totally ridiculous. No, it's Elfienesque. Same difference. We'll do it Elfkin style: swift, smart and swoosh. Right. Swoosh! - Forget it. I'm staying here. Go do your business, Charles. The pig-dog! Stop. Wait for me! Go. Oopsy daisy! Jelly beans! I'm flying! Oh boy. Yes! I'll help you. Poor little doggie. Down, you rotten mutt. - Not my hat! Harriet, sugarplum, it's your favorite boss. Hi, boss, - Where are you'? What happened to my store? It wasn't me. It was Charles. He went totally nuts. He probably saw a rat. Was it wearing a hat? Come back this instant. Don't you dare dawdle. What happened? - Clean this up, quick. But I'm off now. My shift is over. We can hit the road too. How will we transport all this? Piece of cake. The Elfie way. I feel naked without a hat. I'm not going anywhere. Here we go. That's enough! Watch out, Frieda. This is so much fun! Out of the way! We're back! We got you new ingredients. - Ta-da! Plus other great things, like fart beans. Where did you get all this? From a giant pantry. You've never seen anything like it. Are we friends again? Now it's time to save your bakery! Stop. Don't. It's your choice: bake it or leg it. Fine. Baking apprentice Elfie reporting for duty, Master Baker. Fine. First we'll need strawberries from the garden. Hey. - He tricked us. Hey! Don't you dare start without us. That's humans for you. Sneaky and ungrateful. I want to bake like you. Let get something straight. Elfkins have always helped humans. Now it's your turn to help us. No one has ever helped me. I'm not surprised. A sourpuss like you... Can't catch me! Wrong one. Over here. Wrong again. Loser'. Jackpou I'm not going anywhere until you've taught me to bake. That's blackmail, you little pest. I think that means yes. Afterwards, I want you gone. - I promise. Cross my Elfkin heart. We will. Fine, you can give me a hand. Get me flour, sugar, butter, vanilla extract. - Okay. What are you waiting for? It's not my fault. I need Elfkin-sized tools. Vendla was right. Humans are bossy and arrogant. Destroying your master's store is very, very naughty! Take that thing out of your mouth when I'm scolding you. Not again! The ovens are overheating. We need to fix the control system. There's no rush. We'll all be blown into the air! We really need that new factory. In one week, we'll start with construction. She's a real beauty. What if your brother can pay off his debts after all? As my father used to say, "You have to love what you bake." For that, you need a gentle touch. A gentle touch, got it. You need patience too. Only a bit, though. And precision. Pre... what? Can I do some baking now too? - No. But we had a deal. Hold your horses. I said you can give me a hand, that's all. "I'll be a pastry chef and win the biggest hat ever." Just you wait! Hey, I can't work like this. Baking is so fun! It's floury in here. - Not another word. Got it? Got it? - You said we couldn't talk. We've got it. I thought you wanted to learn how to bake. - You won't let me. Learn to use your hands first. Maybe then I'll show you how to bake from the heart. Now get to work. - Okay. Enough. It's my bedtime. You clean the kitchen. Finished. It's spick and span. Can we sleep here? - No. No way. Just this once. I think sourpuss is a lot nicer than he seems. Humans often seem nice. Then all of sudden they turn mean. What do you know about humans, Mr. Pea-brain? Call me a pea-brain one more time... If that's what you want. Pea-brain. - Tiny hat-wearer. No, don't. We'll be quiet. I told you. Humans are mean. What's going on? Are we on a boat? Just great. Let's see if we can find a lantern. What for? There's one in the sky. If only the others could see this. Look! - Amazing! I'm fine, thanks for asking. Incredible! Hello. Sorry. We didn't touch much. - It's so pretty. The Moon Song. Bruno and I used to listen to it every night. Why don't you get along anymore? It's a sad story. Tell us! - No. I want to sleep. - But we know where you sleep... Okay, okay! Fine. We used to be the perfect team. I'd sneak into Dad's kitchen at night to bake. Bruno would sell everything to the kids living nearby. They were crazy for my cupcakes, and Bruno was a brilliant salesman. We spent our earnings on toys. Boy, it was a true paradise. At night, I'd write new recipes in my notebook, and Bruno would stuff our earnings into our little treasure chest. Anyway, that was long ago. Hey, but what about the sad part? Finish the story. - Please! You little pests. It began with the International Confectionary Championship. I was the youngest person ever to win. Dad was so proud of me. And Bruno was jealous? - Yes. That was the end of our dream team. When Dad died, Bruno wanted to close the store and build a factory. Conveyor belt cakes! Baking is an art form. Theo Hampus will never work behind an assembly line. Things spiraled out of control. Bruno upped and left. Soon after, he built that ugly building right opposite. He's left me a poor baker, while he's a wealthy sleazebag. That's the whole story. Now go to sleep. We're getting up early. Yes! Buck! Kipp! It's time to start baking. How do you propose we use all those heavy machines? That's where you come into it, pea-brain. What do you say? It's incredible, right? We built you this crazy machine And now it's time for you to see With Elfkin-skill and Elfie-power We'll become the masters of the flour Mixing bowls clatter, we're in the zone Elfie-chaos takes control We know the tricks that really stick And you can't help but think it's fantastic Now don't become flustered This is super-Elfienesque! 'Cause me Kipp and Buck are simply the best That's Elfkin style Yeah, yeah, yeah Yeah, that's Elfkin style That's Elfkin style yeah, yeah, yeah Yeah, that's Elfkin style That's Elfkin style We're sweeping through the bakery, the wind of change is blowing Put the pedal to the metal 'cause when the Elfkin show is showing We do everything we can 'cause that is what we do Once the Elfkin ball is rolling we cannot be stopped! Yo, we be bakin' up a storm, we ain't beatin' around the bush Elfie, Kipp and Buck are baking swift and smart and swoosh That's Elfkin style We do it right You can count on us completely This is Elfkin style Yeah, yeah, yeah Yeah, that's Elfkin style That's Elfkin style Yeah, yeah, yeah We do it right This is Elfkin style Yeah, yeah, yeah Ready, set and go! Kipp invented it all. He's got more in his pea brain that you'd think. Piece of cake. You're all nutty, and I like it. Now it's time to save your bakery. Try this. - Too much sugar. Is it better now? - Stir it for longer. More cinnamon. What are you doing there? - I'm not ready yet. Don't look. Your cakes are really tasty, but we need to make this place so much "Elfier!" Good thing Elfkins are here to help. What does this thing do? Again! I'm ready now. You told us you have to love what you bake. Well? What do you think? You're doing it on purpose. I didn't think you had it in you. It's just like it used to be. But even better. We just cleaned the floor. - Leave him alone. I told you we'd do it Elfkin style. You really did. You're small, but when it comes to helping, you're the greatest. Wait a minute. What a cool lightning machine. It's time to open the bakery. Come in, everyone. So soon? Hey, you have to smile. Like this. No, even more! Come and help. Like this. Now stay like that. Why isn't anyone coming? Well, the store has been closed for years. They'll come soon enough. - Definitely! No one remembers me. We can change that. Load up. All aboard. Fart rocket ready for takeoff. This plan is much too Elfienesque for me. Trust me, you get used to it. I've forgotten something... UP We go! You're doing great, Kipp! Look at that. - What's that? Huge snowflakes! - No, flying muffins. There's writing on it! What does it say? "Hampus Bakery." It's mine! -"Tomorrow at ten, grand re-opening." Give it to me! Come to Rosa! I'll eat my hat if this doesn't work. What is that? Stop the car! Finally! Elfie, now I know what I forgot. The brakes! Are you okay? It's the test phase. - We'll go again tomorrow! Out of the question. Why not? Because... I was worried about you little nincompoops. Because you like us, Mr. Sourpuss? I wouldn't put it like that. Fine, fine. Darn it! As human's go, he's pretty okay. What... What was that? Yummy! How did that loser turn things around so fast? Are you sure about this, boss? Quiet! This is our... - This is so scrumptious. This used to be mine. I don't believe it. He made all this using our old toys. We'll be nice and quiet. She means we'll try. Careful. - Get out! This is my bakery. And this is my bulldozer! You can't use it. I can use anything I want in my house. It's my house too. All of a sudden? You always said the bakery was too small and pokey. You wanted to put it up for sale. We were in debt up to our noses. Fancy baking isn't enough. Selling is an art form too. But you and Dad never understood that. You had your moment of glory. The youngest champion ever! Dad's pride and joy. You had to go and ruin everything. Now you and this ramshackle place will make space for my factory. We have to help Theo. I'm not ready to meet my maker. Remember the legend? The tailor's wife's trick? Now! No! That wasn't supposed to happen. Theo! Theo, wake up. Theo! - Quick, hide. He's alive. But it doesn't look good. Call an ambulance. His old recipe book. He needs to rest now. He has a severe concussion. They're giving him a sedative. He'll have to stay here for a few days. It looks like his shop has had it. I didn't want it to happen like this. Theo, could you please wake up? It's important. Look, he's waking up. Oh my, three garden gnomes. You're walking on thin ice! No, it's me, Elfie! Talking garden gnomes. No, don't go to sleep, Theo! Hey! Wake up! Wake up! Come on. Wake up. - Forget it. When someone his size conks out... When he wakes up, his bakery will be gone. What are you doing? Saving the bakery. Just the three of us? She's delusional. I'll get us help. The bakery opens at 10 o'clock. We have time. No human would ever help an Elfkin. I'm not asking the humans. I'm enlisting the others. Theo said it himself. We're the greatest at helping. If Bruno shows up... We'll take care of him. You'd better come back. Be careful. Hey! Hey! Where is everyone? Hello? Let us always remember Kipp, Buck and Elfie. Wherever their souls are, may they always have a warm hat on their heads. We do! Don't worry about that. Elfie! We thought you were... Where have you been? Elfie! - Up there, with the humans. She's totally lost it. - Where are Buck and Kipp? Looking after Theo's bakery. Who's that? Theo's a human being. One of the good ones. He taught me to bake. You can eat them. Try! - Really? Take it. I made them myself. I'm a baker now. That may be the case, but you'll get the others right now, and then we'll never speak about this again. I don't think so! You have to come with me. I have a plan... Little one, your plans are usually pretty dangerous. But Theo needs our help. If he can't manage alone, that's his problem. But helping is what we do best, isn't it? Says who? Theo and me. Dratted hat, don't you get it? Helping is our real purpose in life. Not how well we build chairs or dye shoes. Hush! Not even how well we bake. We forgot our real purpose. We Elfkins are the only ones who can help Theo. So what do you say? Nothing's going to change. They stay up there, we stay down here. I really wanted to help you. It sounded so easy in the legend. You humans sleep, while we do it Elfkin style. I guess I'll never be a real Elfkin. Hold on. The jury is still out on that. They showed up in the bakery all of a sudden. It was easy to find. We followed the smell of your cakes. We don't want people saying we Elfkins don't help one another. My goodness, humans are even bigger and uglier than I thought. Fine. We'll help you. But there's one condition. When we've finished, we're leaving and never coming back. That goes for you too, Elfie. So what's your plan? We need Theo to make it work. Push! - Left! More left. Right! Now what? Now we bake till our hats are smoking. Theo will sell what we make. Come on. He's just a human. A harmless human. - I'm not sure... See? He wouldn't hurt a fly. How will this snoozing monster ever sell anything? You must be crazy. If you say so. But just you wait until the show starts! One, two, one, two, one, two... Out of the way. Good job! You have to stir longer. What do you think? Harriet, order the bulldozer. It's showtime. Quick, everyone take your positions. Hello? Is anyone here? Beautiful. Focus! Welcome to my little shop of wonders. What can I get you? Lemon fish? Elfkin hats? Or would you prefer the moon? Wonderful. I'll take them all. - Really? I mean, that's a brilliant decision. Thank you. Have a nice day, Madame. Be sure to recommend us. It worked! Ladies and gentleman, and now for our specialty: cream spires! Cream spires! What's wrong with him? - Good heavens? A work of art. In my dream, you were tiny and wearing funny hats. What now? - Get them out. Quick. Ladies and gentleman, the show is done. Hope you had fun. It must be part of the performance. - Is it over already? Don't go! No, it's time to go home! I'll bring my wife tomorrow. What's going on? My bakery? Is this my bakery? You bet. We're going to make sure it stays that way. But... how did you... We had a little help. May I introduce... My friends! - You're the best! You all... You really are the greatest. Thanks. Thank you so much. - No big deal. The glass baking line. It should have four lanes! Actually, let's make it eight. Eight baking lanes. We're even. I don't want to see you in my bakery again. But he was in hospital... What'? The hat! So it wasn't a rat. It was garden gnomes. Garden gnomes? Those are Elfkins. My brother has Elfkins! It's not fair. They raided my store. They're criminals. Now it's time to celebrate! Where is everyone? What's wrong? I have to go, Theo. Nonsense! Forget about our silly deal. It's expired. You don't have to go. - But I do. That's how it works with Elfkins. When our work is done, we have to go. But there's still so much to bake. Strawberry and ginger cakes. Marshmallow cookies... with melted chocolate! Please stay. We need to make this place so much "Elfier!" But I can't. I promised them I'd leave. But... But... You'd better not forget me, Mr. Sourpuss. I won't, you little pest. Oh, yes... I have a little something for you. For me? I've got my own hat! A really big one! Thank you. I'm going to miss you all. We'll miss you too. Bye. That's some hat. Congratulations, Elfie. It's time to go. - Yes. Enough of the long face. I'm looking forward to your cakes. What's that? An animal? It's a contraption! Well done, Charles. No! Not my hat! They do look like garden gnomes. They're so cute. Can I have one? No. I still need them. When Theo finds out, he'll knock your hat off. He's my friend. Your accomplice, you mean. You looted my store together. I'm not one to hold a grudge. I'm offering you a glorious future in the world's most modern factory. You're going to love it. Dream on! He sure can. We're leaving. Let's go - All together. Now lift it. Now what? There! We'll take the cable car. I can taste freedom! No, wrong direction. Nice try. You're staying here. Brother dearest! I've always wanted to drive one of these. Remember? Hey! I paid off my debt. By stealing from me. That doesn't count. I know all about your criminal little friends. Get them on screen, Harriet. Let them go! They didn't hurt you. They robbed me blind and destroyed my store. They'll be working in my new factory. Out of my way. And we're live. They'd much rather work for me than in your dump. Let them go, and I'll get out of your way. Don't do it, Theo. - Move! I bet my hat he wouldn't give up his bakery for us. You stubborn mule. Don't do this. Let them go, or you'll have to drive over me. You were always like this. Totally inflexible. Harriet, bring me those munchkins. They're Elfkins! Not munchkins. Theo! No! Don't do it. It'll have all been in vain! No! Harriet, get back inside! Got it. They don't go free. You double-crosser. Elfie! We have to stop Bruno. Elfie, come back. Stop it, jelly-belly! I'm driving a digger! Stay here. We won't repeat the tale of the tailor's wife. This time we'll defend ourselves! I won't stand for this. Harriet, where are you? I've been held up! Follow me! Hey! Wrong direction! Elfie! Elfie? Elfie! Where are you? Here! Are you okay? Sorry. It tastes disgusting. Help. Help! Bruno! Bruno! Darn it! Help me, please. He doesn't really deserve it... Let's go. Elfkin ladder. I'm sinking! - Stay with us. No! No! No, Elfie! Elfie. - Where is she? Oh no! We got you! The old pin in the butt trick. Amazing. - You saved my life. You all helped me. That's just what we do. What's going on now? The place is about to explode. No! My baking paradise. Everything is ruined. Admit it: you're happy. Remind me... who wanted to destroy something? It was you. That's the way it's always been. No, that's not true. Don't you remember? It's time for you to finally get along. Elfie is right. It's not that hard. We Elfkins always used to think: "Humans? Who needs them? Humans? We Elfkins don't need them. Humans..." "...eat Elfkins for breakfast. Hats and all." The truth is, we've been missing you all this time. That's right, we just forgot.
