Death and The River Santa Viviana - One out of many torrid little Mexican villages. Fertile, pretty, with its weekly marketplace where countless peasants flock. A deep river slowly flows near the town. Many years ago, a flood destroyed the village... which was then rebuilt on the opposite bank. But the cemetery remained at its original location, because the villagers wouldn't disturb the dead. You might think that peace reigns in Santa Viviana... However, life on the village is presided... by death... - One more shot, compadre? - As many as you please! - You and I are one, buddy! - Soul mates! - May you be in good health! - Bless you! Bring me my godchild, I want to see him! - Here he is! - Ah, isn't he an angel! - Let me give him a kiss! - No! He?ll get drunk on your breath! Here you are, buddy! I toast to my godson's health! May he live long! Hooray! Take my word, I'll love this kid as if he was my own blood! - Fill it up, mate! Let's toast! - For our everlasting friendship! Listen, I hereby swear that I'll have a son... if only to make you his godfather! - Who with? With the first chick that makes eyes at me! You?re always chasing skirts, compadre. You bet! But take care, my buddy, take care. You know the saying, "If a cock won't nip around the hen's hip... " You better watch your mouth. Nobody says such things about my wife, you son of... Hey, buddy, what's the big fuss? I respect you... and I was only joking. To hell with your jokes! Nobody talks to me like that! And you, least of all! After all, I say whatever I want. Who's gonna make me shut up? If anybody has anything to say just come here! It's your brother, Joaqu?n! His buddy just stabbed him dead! - Somebody must look after my wife and son! - Don't worry, bro! You son of a bitch! You'll come out some day! Either you or your children will pay for this! Savages! Why would children have to carry that curse? Ah, but that's nothing, Elsita! Just a few days ago... about 20 days ago, I went to Tanque?n... Would you please stop telling those stories to Gerardo? Excuse me, but you asked me to bring the latest news! But if you want me to shut up, I'll shut up. Speak about nice things, not atrocities! That won?t do him any good. Ah, not much to say, then... All right, let's talk about you. When will they take you out of this capsule? - Soon, I hope. Maybe next week. - So, as they say, the rice is cooked! Not quite. I'm still in pain. And I can hardly breathe without this... awful machine... - The day will come! Oh, it's hot in here! I'll take off my jacket. - Carrying a gun, Chinelas? - Don't worry, it's not loaded. It's in honor of my mother, who always made me carry it. She said that, to be safe, you should carry the Virgin of Guadalupe and... Sound advice! Well, I must leave for a while. But I warn you, no creepy stories! - At your command! - You're warned, Chinelas. Disobey and you're out! Elsita is an angel. I wish I were sick. You can say that again. She's been everything to me. Before I fell ill, my helper and friend. Now she's my nurse. She's looked after me as if she was my own mother. Did my mother know you were coming? - She won't have anything to do with me, right? - Well, I don't know... I told her, but... See, she thinks you should be by her side. I almost died. She's never come to visit. Not even once. - Would you please sponge me off? - You must forgive her. They keep telling her you are the disgrace of the Anguianos. - She believes I'm a coward, I know. - Try to understand her point of view. Anguianos ran out of men. You're the last one, and everyone expects... - That I go kill someone I haven't even met! But you see, I've studied! I'm a doctor! They can't force me to perpetuate... some absurd family revenge! - Right, but they don't see it that way. I couldn't care less about the village! I can't believe it... She took me out of there when I was a kid, so I could grow and live in peace. And she swore never to let me go back. Why has she changed so much? So much? - Whenever you please, Mechita... - Yes, let's go. - Look who's there. - Yes, I see. Hey! You're so brave, R?mulo Menchaca! Especially with a woman! I'm braver with men! You'll find out, if your son ever dares to come back. But I guess he'll only come if someone ropes him in! - My son is sick! - Sick of fear! Like all Anguianos... No offence meant, of course... You see? If he were here, you wouldn't have to go through this. - Could it be true he's paralyzed? - That's what they say. You don't seem to show too much interest in finding out. I'm not interested in what a big mouth may say! You can try shutting up this big mouth whenever you please! You go tell that to Alfonso Lepe who has it in for you! - Anyway, I'm fed up with you! - Hey, hey, calm down! I rubbed salt on his wound, that's why! No wound at all! My honor is way above whatever you may say! I'll do what I must in due time! And not because of a provocation! As for that cripple, I know what I'll do. Excuse me, miss. Where can I find Gerardo Anguiano? - You mean Dr. Anguiano? - Yes, miss. - Ask at the information desk, please. - Thank you. Breathe in... Breathe out. Breathe in... Breathe out. Quite better! Lots of patience and some patches and he'll be as good as new! Close it. You'll be out of there in a few days. Next time, cure all the polio you want, but don't catch it! Particularly because I'll be needing you. And soon, very soon... - Me? - Yes. I'm getting old, and I need new blood to take over the clinic. - And you thought about me? - I wouldn't tell you otherwise. I leave you in good hands. We'll talk about this later. - Goodbye. - Goodbye, professor. - And thanks a lot! - My pleasure. - Some news, huh? - You bet! The best medication of all! I could tell by the doctor's eyes that you?ll soon get well. A bright future awaits you! - And I have you. - Well, that... That's the most important thing. I don't know what I would have done without you. - I might have never been cured. - Don't exaggerate! Anybody would say I... Yes? - I've come to see Gerardo Anguiano. Excuse me, sir, but the patient can't have any visits without prior consent. - Let him in, Elsa. - But... All right, as you please. Only for a second, right? - Is it you? - Yes. And you know who I am? I don't know you. But I guess you're R?mulo Menchaca. - Good guess! - Sit down, man. It was about time we met. - What have you come for? - Well, in the first place... to check if you were really ill and disabled. Because back home they say it?s just a big lie! - You see it's true. - Of course. Anyway, I didn't come to fight. Even if I did, who would fight a cripple or whatever you are inside that thing! And besides, why fight, R?mulo? Why? Your father killed mine, isn't that enough? We have nothing to do with that. It was their fight, and it was long ago. To me, it's just like yesterday! I'll have to put up with it, for now. But when you get well... I might not even want to fight with you when that day arrives, R?mulo. I don't want to play the hero just to please my mother... and those who, like her, live in that wild world! Wild? Only a bastard like you would criticize his own mother! You don't need to insult me, R?mulo. I'm not criticizing her. The village's isolation is to blame. Tradition, ignorance... My mother is just a victim. And so is yours. Shut up, you brute! No bastard speaks about my... Truth is... What I've just done is not right. I overdid it. And I don't want to shame my ancestors. Forget it, R?mulo. I know you're brave. Incapable of hitting a sick man. Don't think I'm softening! I'll kill you some day. But it will be face to face. Well, as I said. I did you wrong. I'll be seeing you. Goodbye. Courage! - Tired, aren't you? - Yes, a lot. It amazes me you've withstood this little stroll so well. Me too! It's the first time I feel fatigue can be pleasant. - Now I really believe I'll get well. - Sure you will! As long as you don't get another visit from the village... and have a relapse. Like the last one you had. - What did that brute have to say? - What do you think? - Nonsense. - You promised you'd tell me about it. - But you keep silent as a grave. - It was no big deal. He wanted me to get well so he could kill me. Or so I could kill him. You? Dr. Anguiano trying to stab or shoot somebody? I can't imagine that! But, why? Because an Anguiano and a Menchaca shot each other a century ago. Really stupid! They argued about a cow grazing the other one's field. That started a vengeance cycle that's almost finished up both families. - But that's preposterous! - Villagers don't see it that way. They've always killed each other with ferocious, irresponsible hatred! A river flows near the village. It's deep, and its waters are dark. After men kill their enemies in a fight... they swim across the river and hide in the bush. The fallen enemy crosses in a black canoe, on his way to the cemetery. My father, Felipe Anguiano, crossed the river both ways. If a man kills face to face... he's allowed to flee and live in the bush, until his debt has been paid. But no one can go visit him. Everybody respects the tradition, which, over time, has become law. They say there was a time when men were murdered every day. Those were the times of my grandfather, a man beloved by everybody... who always mediated between rivals and tried to avoid the killings. - How much? - 200 pesos. It's one of best. - Tom?s! Come here for a moment. - At your service, Don Nemesio. - Good morning, Don Nemesio! - Good morning! - Buying a gun? Who will you shoot? - Nobody. I just want to have one. Listen, Tom?s. Didn't you beg me to sell you that black stallion? Yes, and I still want it! Well, you can have it right now. It's worth the money in your wallet. Oh no, Don Nemesio. I swear to God I'll pay you. But not right now! You'd rather buy the gun. Can't you see it's stupid to spend so much in a gun... when you can have a beautiful horse? - And I'll buy it too. I don't care about your money. I hope that purchase won't cost you a trip across the river! Give me the gun. - Good morning! - Good morning, Tata! - Where are you going, son? - To see Chinelas. - Are you feeling any better? - A lot better, today. - You coming home tonight? - Sure! Else your daughter will kill me! - We'll be seeing then. And behave! - Don't worry, Tata. What's up, Chinelas? - Come in, bro! What are you doing? Some people say the color of the hair shows what became of the soul. - Whose hair is that? - Antonio Lepe's. His mother wants me to embellish the tomb where he's buried. Poor Antonio! He was taken down so fast! They brought you this. Hi, Felipe, how're you doing? I've come to fetch your son. Hey, leave that and come with me! - Where to? - I want to buy some earrings for Merceditas. You know more than I about those things. Help me pick some nice ones. - Right now? - Right now! Come on, you bum! Stand up, you're always tired! He won't wake up until I pull his covers! Just like his father! Poor dad! I guess he died so he wouldn't have to put up with you! Shut up, you fool! Big mouth! Keep away! Go with your friend! - Let's go. - Goodbye, Dona Eulalia. - Don't forget your gun! - My gun? What for? - For whatever. - Whatever is not for me! Either you strap it on yourself or I'll strap it on for you! There have been lots of cowards in my family and I don't want another! - Felipe is carrying one, see? - What else can I do, Dona Eulalia? - Not my own choice. - No, Felipe, he's a chicken! You should be wearing the pants in the family, not me! That's right, off you go. Godspeed you! - So long, mother. - Goodbye. - Goodbye, Dona Eulalia. Wait here. Glad to find you, Polo Menchaca. I want to have a word with you. Go ahead, S?zimo. Your cattle keeps trespassing into my land, and I've had enough! - They're just animals, what could they know? - But you do know! Next time I'll shoot them! You catch me unarmed! But I'll get you soon enough! - That's it! - How do they look? Great! But who would notice them, right next to your pretty face? - I'll go fetch a mirror! - Wait! Let me see them first! Mercedes, you should make yourself the idea... that we won't be together for long. - Why do you say that? There's no way out. Should I have to cross the river in the black canoe... marry someone decent! Not a Menchaca, for God's sake! But, Felipe, why don't you leave the village? Run away? No m'am! I'm not afraid of bullets, just of cowardice! For God?s sake, Felipe! There must be a way! You're blinded by blood. If you leave the village, I'll go with you. We'll be together. My beliefs, my reputation... I don't care about them. Stop it! You don't understand about these things! Felipe! - Come on, Don Julian. It's your turn. - Easy, son. This hand is quite strange. - Would you bet on these? - No, I wouldn't, Father. Well, I will. Four... and all in. Excuse me dear Father, but I figure... What is it? - Sir, your godson wants to see you. - Ask him to come in! I already have, but he says he won't come in! I'll be right back! Play my hand, Chinelas. - Let's make the most of the dove! - Beware of this eagle. - Good evening, godfather! Hello, son. I wanted to know if you were feeling better. A lot better! We're playing cards, come in! - Come on! What's wrong? - I don't want to see Felipe. So what? You've met here before. No need to speak to each other. Yes, but... things have changed. I better not. Are you going to start over again? Listen, Polo. I love you like a son... and Felipe will become one very soon. I want no hard feelings in my house. That's why I won't come in! I'm fed up with those Anguianos! That's enough! Forgive me, Tata. I honor all your advice. And I swear that, whatever may happen, I won't be the one to start it. - Check. - I'm in. Draw. - Three. - None. - Felipe! - Here I am, Tata. Something has happened between you and my godson. No sir! He's telling tales! That's their style! - Polo is no tell-tale! - But he wants to set you against me! Swear to God I haven't laid eyes on him for over a year! - What about your cousin Z?simo? - I know nothing about that... but I can find out. - Please, do. - Sure, Tata. I told you. This keeps getting uglier and uglier. - I beat them up for you! - No way, son, no way... What's wrong, Don Nemesio? I don't know when all this hate and revenge will come to an end! Anguianos against Menchacas, Codinas against Lepes... all because of stupid old quarrels! - Manly affairs, Don Nemesio. You criticize our traditions 'cause you were not born here, but... So what? Can you tell me who you're serving by these deaths? Not the nation, that's for sure! Nor progress, nor the family! When will you understand there's nothing better than peace! Right, but don't forget God knows about what happens here... so it's God's will... - You mean God agrees with these crimes? That's not what I said! You should condemn violence in your sermons! And I do, son! I do! But I can't ask my congregation... to let themselves get killed like lambs! He's absolutely right. You're exaggerating. I'm exaggerating? When even the poorest spend their few cents buying guns? Everybody carries a gun! I'm sure the only people who don't carry a gun in this town... are you and me. - Speak for yourself... I do. - Way to go, Father! - Why, Father, it sounds like a joke! - Hello, Don Honorio. - Trouble in the village? - So-so. - Let's get a drink and we'll chat. I can't right now. I'm in a hurry. I just came to drop this stuff so you pass it to the other bank. - You gonna cross the river? - I won't have a choice. Things are getting quite nasty. Well, should I fall... ...you can keep everything. Just return the horse to my family. - Thanks! But may God forbid! - I'll be seeing you, Don Honorio. Good luck, my boy! I hope you swim to the other bank... and not cross it in the black canoe, like my son. - See you! - Good luck! Hey, lazy bones! Need a hand? No need for that. Do you think I can't manage? - I guess not. - This donkey is very tired, boss. Felipe! Come here! I found your cousin Z?simo drinking at the bar. - He said he'd go after Polo Menchaca! - It was bound to happen! - You left some fine mess! - Too bad! - Let's see you get out of it. - Fault! - Damn luck! Beer. - That was close! - No, not this one. The other one. - I'll shoot the other way around. - I'll eat it! Well, get ready! Turn around, Polo! I won't shoot you in the back! - He's dead. - Yeah, a really bad shooter. Poor Z?simo! - Where's that bastard going? - Hold it, Felipe, hold it! Let's go see what happened! One more to account for! If you hadn't stopped me! - Who's the dead one? - Z?simo Anguiano! - How come they're not chasing you? - They'll get here any moment! No Sunday without a stiff! See you, Don Honorio! I want to get to Monte Viviano before night! All your stuff's right there! Good luck! Goodbye! Z?simo Anguiano's death revived the old hatred. The clash between Anguianos, Menchacas and their supporters seemed imminent. - Good morning, Don Anselmo. - Good morning, Don Nemesio. - Good morning. - I thought you were in San Diego. - I need to talk to you. - Be my guest. - What can I do for you, Don Nemesio? - Have a seat. - Thanks. You must take immediate action! Feelings are running high! If someone lights the fuse, this will be a battlefield! What do you want me to do? Lock up half the town? - Will you let the crimes go on? - Hey, there are no criminals here! And when there were, I chased them like dogs! Men here kill each other face to face. For their honor! Honor? Quite a strange sense of honor! Well, you've got to do something, you're the sheriff! It's no use. Every town has its traditions and its laws. Don Nemesio, stay out of this. Take my advice. Well, I'm telling you I won't take this sitting down! Do what suits you best. - Care for a drink? - No, thank you! And good-bye! Bye, Don Nemesio... My grandfather's prayers were heard. Central authority ordered a general disarmament in Santa Viviana. But things went only that far... - Let him pass! - You may go, Father. You can frisk me. Orders are orders! - I respect the law! - Go on, Father. - Thank you. Everybody stay where you are! Frisk them! Those baskets! Magically, all guns disappeared from the village. Wait here! - How about this coffee, Father? - It's from Don Lucas', right? - Yes. - It's magnificent! Merceditas fixes it wonderfully! Good evening, gentlemen. - Miss. - Good evening. - You must be Felipe Anguiano. - I am. What's up? Sorry sir, but I've got orders to arrest you. On what charges? Have I done anything wrong? It's not what you've done but what you might do! Forgive me, son, but I asked the area commander to take you away... for a few days, until things calm down. It's for your own good. Spirits are red-hot! If you order me to leave, I'll comply. Only thing I regret is I won't be seeing you for some time. So will I, but it's better this way. Should it take long... dad and I will go see you. Right, dad? - Of course! A few days in peace will do you good! Our Tata is a prudent man, and he knows what he's doing! - Hope you're not mad at me, boy. - I understand, Tata. Let's go! Take me wherever you please! But I must first say farewell to my mother. Bye, Mercedes. Bye, my boy. Do as they say and behave! - Good luck, Felipe! - Good bye. Crescencio! My brother! I'm so glad to see you! Why did you come? You'll be in trouble if they find out! - They won't find out. - These are clothes, right? - Yes, mom sends it. - I really needed it! Man, did I need a drink! It's good for loneliness... How's everybody? Is mom still crying? - No. - Tell me the news! - The soldiers came. - To confiscate all guns, right? - But you fooled them, right? - Sure. They arrested Felipe Anguiano. - And why would they do that? - So there would be no fights! Well, I hope he never comes back! How good you came, brother! What's in here? Beans. I've still got some. Ah, brother, living here like an animal is so hard! No human faces in sight, nobody to talk with! You just think and think. About the wife, friends... the village... Everybody must be getting ready for the Jalpa procession, right? - Yes. - Man, would I really like to go! - Because of that business! - But you were a real man! Nobody doubts that! You know what, brother? If Felipe Anguiano dies... there won't be any more fights! - Come on son, have a sip! - Stop it! You'll make him sick! He's as tough as his father! Aren't you, son? - You're as proud as a peacock! - I don't deny it, in-law! Romulito will be a true Menchaca, macho like no other! - Hey, uncle! - What's up, nephew? - Come... - What is it? - I'd be careful if I were you. - Why? - Look who's there... You're really something, Father! What's wrong, Tata? You look worried. I won't relax until you're gone. You must honor your word! Don't you worry, Tata. I'll be back there before 10. Felipe has come to visit me, not to get a scolding. Let's go. - Well, I'll be seeing you. - Take care! Let's go, Felipe! - That was a nasty look, uncle. - Yes, he won't forget about Z?simo. - And he's come for payback! - How would you know? - He's an Anguiano! - So what? - You should know. - Of course I know! You should keep your mouth shut! Listen, Felipe. You can't fool me. I know you too well! - Oh, come on! Same old song! - No! This is new! You've come for revenge! - Tell me the truth! - What's got to be has got to be! So it's best to get on with it, once and for all! But you promised you'd return this very night! What promise? I ran away! They won't find me when they come tomorrow! You plan to go find Polo in Monte Viviano. Are you crazy? They'll go after you! That's against the law of the village! And I respect it! But somebody must pay for Z?simo! - Is your mind made up? - Yes! - Then we're done for good! - What are you saying? - Same as you. What's got to be has got to be, once and for all! If I have to cry for you, today or tomorrow... well, it better be now. I can't bear this any longer! Don't take it like that. I don't know what I'll do, but I really don't want you to suffer. Would you be happy if I went back to my jail? Yes. But you must promise you won't be asking for trouble. I promise. But if they come asking for it, they'll get it! - Cheers! - Cheers, in-law! - Coming? - You go ahead. I'll meet you there. - We better wait. - One more bottle and I'll be there. Come, help me! - You go back with your aunt. - What about you? I'll manage. What's got to be, has got to be! - Coming with us, Filogonio? - He better not! - This is our business! - Well, then, my regards! Good luck, buddy! Forgive me, love, but it wasn't my fault! What? What have you done, Felipe? - I had to kill Filogonio Menchaca. - No! I've come to tell you the truth... and to say goodbye. Now I'll go hide in the bush, and only God knows when we'll meet again. Why did you do it, Felipe? Why? - You gave your word you'd... - And I kept it. I swear to God. He ambushed me by the road. And he shot at me. If I hadn't shot back, I'd be the one lying there! I believe you. But what are we going to do, Felipe? Resign ourselves and wait. That's all I care about. Don't leave me like this! Don't leave me like this, Felipe! - Good evening, Dona Mar?a. - Good evening. What can I do for you? - Is your son home? - My son? Of course not. He went back to jail after the festival. But before that he killed Filogonio Menchaca. - My Felipe? - Your Felipe. If you see him, tell him he better run away, or else! Excuse me, m'am! Let's go! Halt! You two go back! The rest, come with me! The law of the village forced dueling killers to flee, who were then chased through sheer formality. The jail of the desert stretched beyond the river. Anguianos hid in the bush. Menchacas, in Monte Viviano. Hold your fire! We missed him! Let's go! Say good-bye, my child. Say good-bye to your dad. He's been killed and you'll never see him again! They killed him all right. And don't you ever forget it! Guadalupe! Manuel! Menchaca has come to pay a visit. Strange custom. The dead man also goes to visit his killer. Come out and see a dead Menchaca! - You killed him, come out! - That's right! What did you come for? There are no men left in this house. Go your way and bury the dead man in peace! It's because of them we're in mourning! We're all in mourning in this town! Go on your way! Go on! Felipe! - How's it going, Don Honorio? - Fine, boy, fine. Been waiting for you for three days. I'm sick of potatoes and canned food! I keep my word. This time I've brought you lots of things. Just leave that now and tell me. How are things over there? - Worse than ever. - What's wrong? When you guys were done, your friends started over. Many men want to leave the town. You can't live or work or do anything there! I'm really sorry. Have you seen my fianc?e? Sure! And she gave me this for you. Old man, why didn't you tell me? I left the best for last. Everything your mother sent is on the mule. - Has anyone seen you? - No, I was careful. - Good morning, Dona Joaquinita. - Morning, hasn't the doctor arrived? Yes, he's been inside for a while now. - Go to the druggist right now. - Yes, sir. So, doctor? My time is up, right? Don't be silly. You're not a boy, of course. But you'll bury us all. You know the drill. Rest a lot, a large dose of peace and quiet... take your medication... and wait. Cheer up. Let's go and hear what he says. The Noyolas are there. From the Anguiano party. What matters now is El Tata, let's go. How is he, doctor? Be prepared for bad news. The heart is worn out and can fail at any time. - Is he going to die? - Some day, like all of us. The town will be sad if he dies. It would be a great loss. Excuse me. Dear Felipe: My father is gravely ill and I'm lonelier than ever. I have only one joy. Since I wasn't sure I didn't want to tell you about it. But now I am sure... I'm pregnant with your child. How's the bathing, Felipe? All right. What are you waiting for? Just shoot. Kill you like this? You don't know me very well. Wait until I get my gun, then. I didn't come to fight, Felipe. So what did you come for? To get you. - So? - Shoot, if you want! No... tell me first. Don't you know? El Tata Nemesio has died. What did you say? My brother came to tell me last night. The Menchacas say that don Anselmo told them we're allowed to go to the wake. And to have peace between us and the Anguianos that day in honor of El Tata. The old man died. Death is pretty busy lately. - Are you going there now? - Right now. And you? Me too. I'm on my way. You heard the message, there's no more to say. I can wait for you there, if you want. We don't have to be friends to travel on the same road. Poor Tata! The only good thing in town is now gone. And now we'll drown in blood. That's true. What are we going to do without the man who brought peace so many times? You know what my brother Crescencio said? That the day you die it'll be the end of the Anguianos. That won't be so easy. Because I don't think you shoot by surprise like your uncle Filogonio. - That's a lie! - Lie? He caught me by surprise! I hit him out of sheer luck. You're cousin Z?simo also killed by surprise! Two bullets before I could touch my gun! Listen! Want one? I'm not offering it out of friendship. There can be none between you and I. But today is today, and El Tata would have liked to see us like this. The matches. Lamb of God You take away the sins of the world... Have mercy on us! The two together. Who would have thought? It even looks like you brother likes that Felipe. Now there's intimacy and respect at wakes, but in my days... I was a kid but i still remember... - When Pablo Codina... remember? - Yes. Entered Anselmo Lepe's wake riding on a horse. He cut the dead man's head off, tied it up, and took it to the canteen. Yes, but the dead man's family went to the canteen and skinned Codina. It's time! Be careful! Look at them! They've even embraced! They even look like pals! - Chocolate... do you want a coin? - Yes! Here. Take this to my house, and throw it inside. - Got it? - Yes. And deliver this other one to Felipe Anguiano. - He must be at El Tata's house. - At El Tata's House? - Yes. Drop the envelopes and run away. Understand? If you mention that I gave them to you, I'll box your ears. Don't worry! It's time for me to go and I want to talk to you. Coming? Let's go. Don't go, Felipe. I have no one left but you. You know I can't stay, as much as I'd like to. As soon as you're ready, send Honorio to me, and we'll go where you please. The sooner the better. I don't want to stay in this town any longer. I'm so afraid something might happen to you. That our child could be born without a father. Rest assured it won't happen. Besides, he'll be born far away from here. - What if something happens to you? - Nothing will happen to me. I told you, he and I even walked here together. Felipe... I'm sorry but it's time for you to leave. Yes, I'd better. I have to go by my house to get my things. Felipe... Goodbye, Mercedes. Felipe... Goodbye. Sir, this letter is for you! Who gave it to you? Hey, kid, come here! What does it say? "If you're still a man, come by the Vicar's Alley tonight at 10. " Polo must be involved in this. I'm sure he's not. Polo would have come straight to me. - I'll find out who's behind this, right now! - Leave it! Whoever it is, he'll be sorry. I'm not letting you loose until you leave. - Your coffee, brother. - Thank you, Crucita. It's so good here, I hate to leave. What can you do? I'll prepare some tamales for you. Right on, Crucita. If you're still a man, come by the Vicar's Alley tonight at 10. - When are you leaving? - In a while. - Felipe's still in town. - I know, so what? Since you have to go there anyway... For once... Mind your own business. It's my business because they're saying... that you're afraid of him! - Who's saying that? - Everyone! Let the cowards say it to my face! I think you're forgetting our dead. VICAR'S ALLEY - What can I do for you? - Nothing, what about you? - Nothing. - I'll see you, then. I'll see you. Felipe! Treacherous Judas, both of you! Felipe! It's about him, right? - Yes. - What happened? Go see if the doctor is coming. - We better get him inside my house. - It's useless. Felipe... son... Hang on! He's in bad shape. Felipe! Son! Here she is! Mercedes... Marry us! I was born from that marriage. I'm the last Anguiano. The town expects me to meet face to face with R?mulo, the last Menchaca. I hope you won't give them that pleasure. My duty is to save lives, not to take them. Now I admire you more than ever. You have to be really brave to play the coward. Thank you very much. It's time. It's incredible. I really don't understand. The absolute contempt for human life. It's not their fault, it's their barbaric environment. That's true. Think of the low crime rate in the world among the scientists, researchers... among educated people. I studied at the university, and I learned to respect life. Unfortunately, the gates of knowledge aren't open for everyone. I have absolute faith that some day they will be open. In the meantime, my town will live in darkness. To cross the river. Some black tobacco cigarettes, please. Chinelas! Come here. What's up? You always know about God and the Devil. Tell me... What have you heard about Gerardo? Well, he's not so well, just getting along. But they got him off of that tube, right? On and off. He still walks like an old man, he can't stand up straight. - Do you think he's leaving us? - I hope not! But if he can't breathe, what can the poor guy do? - Shame. - Poor guy. I thought so. If he were healthy, he'd have come to town. - He's a real man. - Sure. Look! Dr. de la Garza and his Aide Dr. Anguiano Head the Polio Committee. - What do you think? - It looks fine. - Aren't you glad? - Yes, but I'd prefer to see him here. Don't you understand, Mercedes? Gerardo is a... - What did R?mulo say? - Who cares about R?mulo now? Your son is a learned man, a sage... and he doesn't think the way the brutes here think! Yes, but he's a man. One day he'll have to come and defend the name he inherited from his father! Oh, Mercedes... This coming from you? When you're so gay and sweet. And your father was... Keep my father out of it! He was a saint but I'm not. The Menchacas killed my husband. And then since I was alone, I had to put up with their insults. It's time someone defended me. I don't agree with you. What you should do is tell... Look, Chinelitas. You've always been a chicken like the rest of your family. If you have no honor to defend, go home and wear a skirt. But leave my son and me alone. Go on, go home and don't bother me. Yes, I better leave. I might utter what I'm thinking. It's my fault for... You can come in. - Dr. de la Garza wants to see you. - I'll be there in a moment. Is it from your mother? Is anything wrong? Looks that way. She says they make life impossible for her. That they humiliate her. That she can't find men to work for her because the Menchacas threaten them... So, what does she want from you? There are clear allusions... "A man's virtues are overshadowed by his cowardice. " "I don't think books taught you to scorn your family's honor. " - That honor thing again. - And in case I don't understand... She makes it very clear at the end. "Most importantly, a son's place is next to his mother. "And however little you love me, you can't allow them to insult me. " I understand how you feel. But think of your future and think of us, Gerardo. - If something were to happen to you... - I know. And I'll try to avoid it by all means possible. But I have no choice but to go. - Can you take me to the other side? - Yes, sir. Did you notice his face? Yes, I think it's Gerardo, Mercedita's son. Wait for me, I'll be right back. - Dona Lupe! - Who is it? - It's me, Juan. Come right in. - How are you? - Fine, and you? What brings you here? - I just wanted to talk to your son. - Go ahead, then. - Shaving? - Can't you see? I bring you news. Guess who just arrived? - Who? - Gerardo Anguiano! - Sure? - Sure! I just saw him 10 minutes ago! He must have come to spend the holidays with his mother. Perhaps. So, what are you going to do about it? Nothing. It will be a lively ball this year. - I can take it, m'am. - I'll wait on my son. - Have some chicken broth. - Thank you, mom. You don't get it like this in Mexico City, right? - Of course not. - Let me look at you. It's been so long. Because you didn't want to come, mother. I waited in vain during my illness. Every day I thought of going, but the road is so rough. And there's always a reason for not leaving here. - Besides... - Besides, what? Nothing, son. I've prayed many times for you. You're a handsome one. You don't even look like you've been sick. - You feel well, don' you? - As good as new. Of course it's been hard at my job... But I had to get myself in good shape, don't you agree? You always have to be in good shape for your job. And for everything. - The killer of healthy men! - Hi, Chinelas. Come here, boy! - How have you been? - Like a drum leather, old, but tight. The boys have come to say hello. How are you, Gerardo. You're finally here! I couldn't come earlier. - Nice to see you here. - And I'm happy to recognize you! He used to play with you when you were a kid, right? - Yes, m'am. - And they're all children of your father's friends. - Mechita! - Aunt! I can't believe your son's arrived! Some will not believe it. Well, see for yourself. Ungrateful nephew! You didn't want to see us! - Hug your cousin! - Come on! It's good that you've come. And remember, if you need us, we're ready. Thank you. - Dona Mercedes? - Hello, Juan. Come in, come in. We came to meet your boy. That's very kind of you. Not at all. For us, your son is the family boss. Come, Gerardo. You can't complain, they're eager to meet you. I can see that, but it would be better if they hadn't come. This is Juan, one of your grandfather's managers. - A pleasure - Nice to meet you. - I'll introduce you to my fianc?e. Come on nephew, give her a hug! Don't be afraid, hug her! And this is my brother. Your brother? My pleasure. - Where are you going, little chicks? - Come on, girls! It's a busy hen house! Finish your drink and let's go dancing! Yes, we'll regret it if we don't. - Will Gerardo dare come here? - That's what we want to see. R?mulo is getting ready. Do you think Anguiano is coming? Don't be anxious, just calm down. Good evening, aunt. - Come in, boys. - How are you, Mechita? - Very well. - Hi, cousin. - Just studying. - Hi, Gerardo. - You all seem happy. How's the party? - Looks like it's going to be good! I'm glad. Cousin, we came to take you to the ball. Thanks, but no. I'd rather stay home with my mother. - Not coming? - Everyone's waiting for you! Yes, to see me and R?mulo kill each other. - I won't give them the pleasure. - Do you know what they'll say? That I'm a coward? I don't care what they say. You're scared! If I answered no, you wouldn't believe me. First time I hear an Anguiano say that. So now you've heard it. In that case, you should have stayed where you were! - Maybe. - Shameful! - We'll see you, aunt. Let's go. It was shameful for you, wasn't it? I swear I'm not afraid of him. You must understand me. I don't want to be killed for a stupid cause. And I'm even more disgusted at the idea of killing someone myself! I understand, son. You were raised in the city and think differently. Mar?a, set the table for dinner. Why don't you try to understand me, mother? I don't feel hatred or desire for vengeance. I think courage should be used for nobler causes. We can't let the town go on with that false sense of honor. You're right son. We must be prudent. And to fight like you say. For noble causes. Don't use that tablecloth, Maria. I think you're right, mother. I'm going to the ball. No. I don't want you to think I'm forcing you to go. By now, everyone must be thinking I'm a coward. And you believe it too. I don't think about it. Look, don't go to the ball. The table will be set and we'll have a wonderful dinner. Wait, son! Where are you going? Don't worry, mother. I'm going where I have to go! Gerardo... I don't want you to go! If I was hard on you in my letters it was because I was lonely... the contempt.. and the poisoned atmosphere! Forgive me, son! You can't go! Don't worry, mother. I'll swim across the river and wait there. But not in the bushes. In Mexico City. God bless you, son! Good evening! Gerardo! - You here? - A miracle! Why? I just changed my mind. Good! I knew you'd come! A drink for my cousin! And tonight, my last name will be Anguiano! You'd better come with me. Come on, Gerardo. - Mind your own business! - But I... - Out! It's good that you came. - Have a drink. - He's here. - Yeah? Where? There! - Wait for me, cutey. Be right back. - R?mulo, let it go! Just wait. - To your health! - Cheers, guys. Good evening! Well, well. I thought I'd see ghosts before seeing you. But it seems like we can settle scores. It's no use provoking me. I'm not going to fight. What did you come for, then? To talk to you. You just like to settle things by talking. But that's not good enough! Cowardly bastard! Don't insult me, R?mulo! Isn't that enough to provoke you? Even an old woman would react! I even feel sorry for you! Come on, R?mulo, let's go! - Leave him alone! - It's not worth it, let's go! You're a coward! You should have stayed home! - Let's go, boys. - Let's go! - Hi, R?mulo. - Hi, you guys! R?mulo! - You? - Yes, me. - I want to speak to you. - Speak, then! Not here. Come with me. - You stay here. - But, R?mulo... - I'm getting tired... - Don't make a scandal! I'm not interested in impressing anyone. The cemetery is full of our people, who killed each other to please the town! - I'll wait for you there, if you want. - I'll be there in an hour. - What did he say? - Nothing! Don't you have another oar? This one's broken! Take this one. - Where's the blue boat? - The outsider took it, 10 minutes ago. Was he here? Then we've talked enough. See you later. Good luck, boy! R?mulo! - Here I am. - What about the cemetery? - Why go any further? - That's true. Let's get down to business! I don't want to fight with you, R?mulo. Why kill each other? Enough words! Don't get near or you'll catch a bullet! You fired first and I wasn't armed. But now I could easily kill you! - So kill me! - What for? I don't hate you and I don't have a macho reputation to uphold! You don't even have the courage to shoot! I'm tired of your insults! When will you understand that you should only risk your life for a noble cause? I'm not afraid of you nor of any other canteen bully! Then fight like a man! Let's get this over with. Your blood or mine! You want blood? Take this! Once I thought we could be friends. But now I see it's useless. I'll leave you with your hate and your macho bullshit! And to show you I'm not afraid... Take it! Take it! Let's see if you're man enough to shoot me in the back! - Maybe I'll pay you a visit in Mexico. - I'd like that, cousin. - Donkeys can't enter Mexico City. - And how did they let you in? Mother... Goodbye, son. Now that you've been here, I'll really miss you. But I'll come often. There's nothing now to stop me. - Bye, Chinelas. Take care of things. - You bet, little doctor. And come back soon. Stop following me, you useless lot! Get away or you'll catch a bullet! Look! What do you want, R?mulo? - Leaving? - Yes. What can I do for you? By the river, you said we could be friends. Don't you think so? I don't know what to believe. I don't even know why I've come. I've been thinking hard for two days! I know how hard it is for you. - I learned a lesson from you. - From me? Yes. You've come to see me in front of the whole town. And I should have gone to see you instead. To hell with the town! Subtitles: supersoft and scalisto for KG
