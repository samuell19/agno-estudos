Sorry, Doctor. There's a patient. I told you I don't want to be here! Just stay still. The doctor will be here soon. I only want one person. I only want that person to heal me. What happened to him? So here's what happened, Doctor. He went to the roof of his boarding. He was yelling to jump off that roof. He wanted to kill himself, Doctor. But before he jumped, the roof collapsed. It crashed down. So he broke his leg because of the fall? Not really, Doctor. So he incidentally fell into my room. And I was watching a horror on my bed. It was so scary! When he fell, I was so surprised, Doctor. So I hit his leg. I thought he was a demon. Are you saying I'm a demon? - What did you hit his leg with? - Doc, my leg... I only hit him with a guitar, Doctor. But an electric one. - Hey! Don't! Calm down. - It hurts! - Yes, calm down. - Ouch. Joni! You're here right now. At least let me examine your leg. Help me, Doc. Help me. Why did you want to kill yourself? What else, Doctor. Because of love... - He had his heart broken. - Joni! If the person you love is going to marry someone else... Ouch. Doctor. What are we going to do with my friend's leg? - Are we going to amputate it, or... - Quiet! Calm down! What they don't know... ...is that my relationship hurts more than a broken leg. Gia. Here. They didn't get the shirt size wrong? Here. It's too small. - Wait, let me check. - Okay. Peace be upon you. Hana Asia Wisata? This is Gia. I want to confirm something. It seems that my umrah group batik were accidentally swapped. The clothes are too small. I see. Thank God. Thank you. Peace be upon you. Just put this in. - They'll exchange it later. - Okay. Here. Oh, yeah. Just bring this with you. Here. - Oh gosh. - This one. Do you remember? The one you used in Bali. The one I bought for you. This is... Why would I bring all these? It'll be hot there. Just wear this so you'll be comfortable. - But not like this. Why would I bring these? - This too. - Am I moving out? - This too. You'll need it. - This one. - Oh gosh. - That's not necessary. - Gosh. Gia is going to do umrah. He's not going on a vacation. Mom, he'll need this. And it'd be great for photos. Huh? He's going there to worship. Why would he take photos? Yeah. Just wear what's necessary. Koko shirt, robes, and all those other things. Listen to your Dad. I already ironed it. Go and get it. Yes, Mom. Do your worshipping properly. Pray... ...for what you want. Hopefully God will listen to your prayers. Amen, Dad. For the longest time, we've been longing to hear the sounds of a baby in this house, right? It's been too long. Mom, if it's about baby noises, just ask Gia. Why is staying single his hobby? He's old too. - Watch it. - Gianne is right. You are at the right age. You have a steady job. You're mentally and physically ready. It's time to seriously think about grandchildren for your Mom and Dad. And for your sister. Hopefully I can, Dad. God, our Protector. Help me with my endeavors and ease my burdens. Guide me to bear my responsibilities to myself... ...and also to the person whose heart You've entrusted me to take care of. Whoever she will be. God. In front of the Multazam, I am asking of You... ...to give me a sign of whose heart I must take care of. Wherever she is right now. The one who You'll leave to me to live our lives till the end. You are the only One who knows all. - Oh, my God. - Oh, my God. - Oh God. - Are you all right? I'm fine. Oh, my God. - Oh, no. It broke. - Sorry that I've made your slipper ruined. It's okay. I'll just go barefoot. I'm afraid my slippers aren't that strong. But hopefully it will be okay. My slipper broke and I got a blessing. I got to walk around with her. This is the hill in which Prophet Adam and Eve reunited... ...after being separated for hundreds of years. When they were sent down to Earth. That's why it's called Jabal Rahmah. Yes. The hill of love. Mount Arafat. During the hajj, millions of people wearing the ihram gather. They're all the same in the eyes of God. Not bothering about their position or wealth. Just as it will be like later. All humans will gather at Padang Mahsyar. After being raised from the dead. A meeting because of love. Life. Death and resurrection. That's so sweet, Doctor. You prayed together at Jabal Rahmah. I also want to do that. Len, you rarely even pray and you're talking about how sweet it is. People pray five times a day. You only pray at times. So what? It's okay to hope. Right, Doc? It's a good thing the big boss manager of medical services isn't here yet. You know what it's like when she is. Are you sure she's your soulmate, Gia? Why not, Doc? We met in front of the Kaaba. We just finished praying. Plus, we prayed together at Jabal Rahmah. That's what a blessing is. So it's only called a blessing if the person is as pretty as Elsa? There are a lot of girls who aren't as pretty as her... ...or as sexy as her, who also prayed in front of the Kaaba. - What about them then? - It's not like that, Doc. For me, a pretty face is a bonus. What's important is her kind heart. Kind heart? Just because you saw her cry in front of the Kaaba? Hey. There are a lot of girls, hundreds of them, who cried in their prayer. But they don't have the money to go to Mecca. Doctor. You're no fun. The story just lost its romance. Leni. Whether it's romantic or not depends on the perspective. I'm just talking about the reality. Yes, but the point is, does Elsa want to be with Gia or not? That's it. I've tried contacting her. Even if it's just through WhatsApp. But until now, the message just has one check mark. Hello? Yes? What is it? Pick you up? Alright. So the material will be from here. This one is also okay. Okay. Wait. Yes? - Why are you taking so long? - Be patient. It's about our assignments. This is important. Next time you ask me to pick you up, you'll have to pay. - I'll go home now. - Okay. - Peace be upon you. - Peace be upon you too. You're so noisy. Yes! She replied! She replied! What is it? You look so happy. - What is it? - Busybody. It's too fancy. That's a big no. This is elegant. Do girls not like elegance? Gosh. Insurance agents also dresses like that. It's not bad, but it's not that great either. Why are you even calling that style? Are you going to a wedding? You're going to meet a girl, or are you planning to enter the forest? Don't forget to bring along your horse! That's a good one. Wear that. I went back and forth and kept changing clothes... ...and in the end, I'm back to wearing my first choice of clothes. Listen to me first. This is casual and has character. It shows that you don't have a stiff personality. But you still have character. Yeah, you're right. Because I chose this. Why did you keep telling me to change my clothes? - Oh, you. - What's with you? - Doctor. - What happened? - She passed out. - Bring her to the bed. Lift her up now. Get ready. One, two, three. Okay. - I'm sorry, Ma'am. - Sorry, Ma'am. - Please wait outside. - Okay. Okay, nurse. Please help my babysitter, nurse. How is she, Doc? Her temperature is normal. Her pulse is normal. There's no sign of injury. She's not an addict. Looking at the color of her nails, they're not pale at all. If from all the diagnosis, there's nothing to cause her to faint... That means... Hey. Wake up. Relax. She's outside. Why did you pretend to faint? Is your period late? Are you pregnant? Did your boyfriend make you pregnant? So, who made you pregnant? - Ma'am. You can come in now. - Okay. How is she, Doc? What's the problem? What happened to her? Why did she pass out, Doc? What is her illness? - Ma'am. I'll give you a prescription. - Okay. Also, please buy a test pack and have her do the test at home, okay? Why a test pack? Yanti. You're pregnant? Yanti. Tell me. Tell me who made you pregnant, Yanti! Answer me! - Ma'am. - Yanti, tell me. Roki? Roki, our driver? Who? Fahri, the helper? Who made you pregnant, Yanti? Answer me! Excuse me, Miss. I want to ask where the patient named Yanti is being treated at. The patient named Yanti just went into the room, Sir. The room is over there. - That one? Thank you. - Yes. Hello. Yanti, that's why you shouldn't work too much. It made you fainted. How is she? What did they say is her illness? Huh? Why are you crying? You. What actually happened between you two? I don't understand. What do you mean what happened? Tell me. You made Yanti pregnant. That's slander. She's not at my level. Why would I do that? - Of course, I wouldn't. - Tell me! - You did this to Yanti, right? - Call for help, now! - How dare you! - This is a hospital, Ma'am! - How could you? - Calm down. It makes me angry, looking at it. Just because his wife isn't pretty anymore. Not sexy anymore. And he just went and did whatever he please. I know, right? His face is so annoying. You saw him, right, Doc? His clothes were like a gigolo's. Hey. Is that what a gigolo's clothes look like? Yeah. - Weird flowers. - So tacky. Where are you right now? I need to wear that shirt now. Yes, Sir. I'm sorry. I got a flat tire. I'll be there as soon as possible. Hello? My gosh. Elsa I've arrived. I'll wait for you. Oh, well. There's no time, too. - Hello? - Hello, Sir. You're here already? Yes. I'm at the emergency. Just ask if you don't know where it is. Are you at the emergency yet? Okay, I'll go there. Doc. Where are you going? You're in such a rush. Hey. That shirt looks familiar. Mr. Gia? I'm here to deliver a package. Right, that's for me. - I'm here to deliver a package. - Oh gosh. - Thank you so much. - Right. - Here. This is for you. - You already paid through the app. - Thank you for helping me. - You don't have to. - But I want to give it to you. - You don't have to. Really. But... - You really want to give it to me? - Yes, I do. - Give me five stars, okay? - Definitely. - Good luck. - Thank you. Gosh. There's barely any room. Thank you. Good evening. Have you made a reservation, Sir? I have. My friend is already inside. There she is. - Ouch! - Be careful, Sir! - Oh gosh. - Are you okay? No. Please come in, Sir. Yes, thank you. Sorry, El. - I caused a racket. - But are you okay? I'm fine. Okay. Let's order. Waiter. The menu, please. Waiter. Waiter. The price tag. I was going to take it off but everything got taken off. Okay, listen. Let's eat first, and then we'll go to my favorite boutique. I'll accompany you to buy clothes, okay? Okay. Waitress, the menu, please. What do you think about my choice? Not bad, right? It's pretty good, and not expensive. You like Game of Thrones? Yes. - Stark Clan is so tragic. - But Jon Snow is cool. Especially during the Red Wedding. - I know, right? It's so tragic. - Right? Can I borrow this? Of course, you can. Thank you. You're welcome. Are you sure you don't want to come in for a bit? No, it's fine. Because I have to work tomorrow morning. If I come in, I wouldn't want to go home. I'd feel bad for my patients. Why would that be? When I'm with you, it feels like time is on fast forward. It feels like there's never enough time to talk with you. Now you're just spouting sweet talks. Alright, then. - I'll head home. - Okay. Don't forget to call me when you get home. I will. Okay... Okay. Peace be upon you. Peace be upon you too. Dr. Inga can't see the romantic side of it. What's so romantic... ...about a smile that made a boy spend so much on branded products? To the point of splurging 10 million rupiah. Correction, Doc. 9,995,000 rupiah. Yes, but is it reasonable to make a girl like that your wife? She keeps buying branded things. Hey, girls can be changed, Mel. Later, after having kids, they'd forget about branded things. All of their focus would be for the kids. Yes, there's a time for when everyone becomes kind-hearted. It's this part that's not okay the most. It annoys me. When you were young, you were rebellious. Partying, shuffling through lovers. But now that no one wants to be with you, this is what you want. "I want to have a husband who will be a good imam." But the imam has to be rich, has a master's degree. If necessary, the master's degree is from an overseas university. So lame. Ever since the rebellious days, all the way until your "kind-hearted" days... ...you always want the good things only. And why not? It's my life. It's my choices. Why are we making so much out of it? - It's because of you too, Gia. - Why me, Doc? You're too much. You do things that are unreasonable, but you act as if it's worth it. No, Elsa is a girl worth fighting for. We'll see. Alright. It's time to work. But, Doc, what is it that make Elsa worth fighting for? Everything. Her smile. Her eyes. She's a human with the DNA of an angel. She likes reading books. The Game of Thrones universe brought us together. She's a soccer fanatic. Even if there's a tiny problem. She supports Liverpool. I support MU. It's okay. We can overcome that. This will be the world's most delicious sayur asem. All of the seasoning has to be just right. Here's the salt. Everything has to be just right. Now I can't wait to try your cooking. - Here, try it. - Okay. How is it? I'm sorry. Is this how sayur asem taste like? I want to make a confession. Actually, I can't cook. But because I want to be close with you and make Gia happy... ...I ended up cooking. Thank you. I'll be right back. Mom, look at him being all romantic. So cute. Gia. How is it with Elsa? You two have been in a relationship for a long time. When do you plan to marry Elsa? A special woman has to be proposed in a special way. What do you mean? So, my plan is to propose to Elsa... ...on my birthday. At a very special place. And I think I'll really need your help, Dad. Help with what? Your quota for taking a vacation abroad. Can I use it next month? - Where do you want to go? - Europe. Europe? Mom, I want to come along. Okay? Please. You'll go with me, okay? Okay, but the point is I'm coming. I haven't gone anywhere. It's so unfair. London, Austria, Swiss, France. We'll go to Lyon. Seriously? Are we really going there? Yes. 100 percent. Later at Lyon, we'll go to the first museum of medicine and pharmacy in the world. Would you like that? 100 percent. Love it. So you mean it'll be next month? Yes. It will also be a family vacation. It'd be really great if you two could come. I don't think I can come. Because next month, I already have things scheduled out of town. Elsa and her Mom will come. Okay, then I want to ask for your permission... ...to start taking care of the tickets and visa tomorrow. Are Elsa and her Mom okay with it? We're okay with it. Did you know that after I prayed in front of the Kaaba... ...it felt like my prayer was answered immediately? - You're sweet talking again. - It's true. Especially since we have so many similarities. Not really. Except soccer. Liverpool is the coolest. - No, they're not! MU is. - Liverpool. MU! I'm really happy being with you. Thank you for everything, Gi. I love you. I love you too. Mr. Broto. Can I help you with something? Yes, Doctor. I... ...have a request. I want you to take my wife off the ventilator, Doc. Oh God. You know that your wife had a stroke, right? A hemorrhagic stroke. Not an ischemic stroke. The bleeding is at her brain stem. The center that controls breathing. She still can't breathe by herself. She still needs the ventilator, Sir. Do you know what would happen if she was taken off the ventilator? I know, Doc. I know. But, Doc... ...I don't have anymore money. I did everything I could, Doc. No one can help me anymore. This. This is the only valuables I have left. Even if I sell it, it won't be enough to pay for the hospital bills. Sir. Calm down first. - If I may... - I love my wife very much. I love her very much, Doc. But I can't bear to see her lying in bed in such a condition. It's hard for me to say this, Doc. But I don't have a choice, Doc. I don't have any other choice. This will be... ...the biggest burden of the rest of my life. I'll feel that I murdered my wife. Oh God. Doc. You can take her off the ventilator, right? You can, right? - Hello? - Hi, Gi. How are you? How am I? I miss you. - What story do you have for today? - Today was really epic. You need to know this. So, today... I have a patient named Mrs. Karmiti. She has a husband. Mr. Broto. Mrs. Karmiti had been on a ventilator for over three weeks. And this morning, Mr. Broto suddenly came to see me. He asked for something that's very hard for him. Hello? Honey? Yes, Gi. Sorry. What is it? - You're really tired, aren't you? - I am. Can I go and rest? Of course you can. Bye, Gi. Speechless. But just think positively. There's no problem. I don't need to be so clingy. I'm so happy! Yeay! - Honey. - Hi. Here, I bought you the most delicious bread and pastry in Lyon. You have to try it. - I'm not lying. This is so good. - Thank you. Okay, wait. One, two... - I'll try it. - Try it. - It's so good! - It's good, right? Gianne, Gia. Hurry up. Everybody's waiting for us downstairs. I'm all ready. Gia's the one taking a long time. As if. Mom, just go ahead with Gianne. I want to go with Elsa anyways. - I see. - Mom, wait a second. - Take care, okay? - Yeah. - Bye, Gia. - Bye. The sun is in my eyes. - The sun was really in my eyes. - It was, wasn't it? - Let's try from your angle. - Sure. Let's try. Photo? Yes. - He's nice, isn't he? - Yeah. Okay. - Be careful going down. - Yeah. The snow. This place is so amazing! Wow! What is it? It's nothing. Let's go. I'll show you a place that's even more amazing. It's time. Come on, Gia. You can do it. This place is amazing, isn't it? It makes me happy to see you smile. I want to tell you something. I also want to tell you something. Can I go first? Okay. Sure. You go first. I think we should just be friends, Gi. Why? You are such a kind person. I've tried to accept you. To love you. I'm sorry, Gi. I can't do it. A month ago... ...my ex returned. And he apologized for hurting me. He's my first love, Gi. I actually don't want to go back to him. At first, I didn't even want to meet him. But when we finally met, he apologized. He told me that he had changed. I can't lie to my feelings either, Gi. I also don't want to lie to a man as kind as you. You deserve better. Alright? Forgive me. God... Hello. Hello. You look sad. My fiancee left me. Oh, no. I am sorry. Do you want to drink something? Chocolate? Thank you. I think yes. The woman I saw with you yesterday... Was she your fiancee? Yes, yes. It's me who took your picture. My name is Wayne. - Yes, yes. - Your name? Gia. It's okay. Things happen. I experienced the same situation a few years ago... ...but today, I'm with my wife. I'm very happy. I can help you, if you want. Thank you, yes. Thank you very much. Good luck. Huh? What's wrong with this? Sorry, Sir. This is my room. What are you doing? You think I can't read? See? It opened, right? How dare you! You took the key to my room, didn't you? I didn't! This is my key. The numbers matched. The number on your card is different. - This is my room, Sir. - Alright, then. So, what then? Are you asking for a fight? Stupid hotel. I don't care. I can't stay here for long. The point is, that schedule can't... Oh gosh. I'll talk to you again later. Okay? Tell your boss that I can't stay in this hotel for long. Oh God. What are you looking at? Sir, I'm a doctor. I can help you with your problem. If you want me to. I'm... ...so sorry that I was so rude to you, Doc. I'm stressed out. I spent a whole day on the plane. A long time on the bus. Sitting until I irritate boils on my butt. Oh gosh. I'm stressed out! I understand you, Sir. - I hope you'll stay healthy. - Amen. Yes. Here. Maybe if you have the time, you can stop by my hospital. Okay. Right. Hey. By the way... ...what brings you to Lyon? Just refreshing myself, Sir. I see. But why are you alone? Not with your wife? I'm not married yet, Sir. - Sorry. - But I came with my family. I see. Okay. - Alright, then. Thank you. - You're welcome. Wait. Can we take a selfie together? It's just proof for my family about these annoying boils. Can I? - Sure. - Okay. Cheers! One more time. I'd feel bad making fun of him if his face is like that. Yeah, Doc. I feel so sorry for him. It's been over a month that Dr. Gia is acting like that. Hey. Where are you going? We can't let Dr. Gia continue being like that. Let's leave him be first. You're really insensitive. - He's really hurt right now. - What if he kills himself? Do you think he's you, who cries so hard after being dumped by a girl? "Crying so hard." What do you think my tears are? Hey, he'll heal by himself in his own way. Just relax. Dr. Gia. Yes, Doctor? Just relax. You'll be fine. Believe me. Okay? Stay strong, Doc. Don't worry, Doc. There are a lot of girls out there. It's just hard to get one. Gia. You don't want to see her photos first? This is Mr. Herman's niece. The man whose boils you treated. We talk a lot. Dad. Let's just talk about this later. I know that this might be too fast for you. You haven't fully healed. But, Gia... Who knows? She might be your soulmate. Is it really that easy, Dad? It took me 20 years, falling and getting up, fighting for your Mom. Your story and mine don't have to be the same. And it doesn't mean that if you introduce yourself to her... ...that she'll want to be with you right away. Okay then, Dad. That means I don't need to rush. What? Won't you try first? Call her. Introduce yourself to her. Send a message through WhatsApp. - Do I really have to do it right now? - Do you really have to delay it? Gia, I already promised Mr. Herman. Out of politeness, just go. Make plans to go to Surabaya. Go and introduce yourself. What happens after that is up to you. Sorry, Dad. - I can't do it. - Gia. It's true that soulmates are set by God. But God asks us, of the soulmates that He chose for us... We search for them. We choose them. Because what's precious isn't waiting. What's precious is the effort itself. This isn't about waiting. But it's more about your sacrifices. It's more about your fight to get her. The bigger your effort is, the better your soulmate and partner will be. Doctor, there's a patient about to give birth! Bring her inside. It hurts, nurse. - Move her to the bed. - Wait here for a second, ma'am. - Be careful. Gently. - Ready. One, two, three. - Okay. - It hurts, nurse. Nurse Leni. Prepare the partus set, medical gloves, oxytocin, and the injection. - Okay? - Yes, Doctor. Sir. Please register your wife at the desk. After that, if you're strong enough and you want to... ...you can see the labor process. Sorry, Doctor. Actually I'm not her husband. I'm just an online bike taxi who opened the way... ...so she could get here quickly. Doctor, let me be the one to register her. Yes, Ma'am. You may do that up front. Thank you. Come on. - Thank you, Sir. - Yes, you're welcome. I apologize, Ma'am. Okay, it's all ready. Let's get in labor. Control your breathing. Hold it in. Your energy. Don't push yet until the next contraction. Okay? - Push again, Ma'am. - Okay! A bit more. - A little bit more, Ma'am. - It hurts. - Okay. - Take a deep breath. Hold it. - Control your breathing. - You can do it. Take a deep breath. Are you ready? One, two, three. - Push, Ma'am! - That's great! Push again. Okay. Hold it in. Hold your breath. - It hurts. - Take a deep breath. - Push again, Ma'am. Just a bit more. - Take a deep breath. You can do it. One, two, three. - Push! That's great! Again! - Push! Just a little bit more! Keep going, Ma'am! Yes. Thank God. The baby is a girl. Clamp. Cut it. Okay. Ma'am, congratulations. The baby is very healthy. Thank God. Doctor, is my great-grandchild a boy or a girl? A girl. Oh God. What is it, Ma'am? Is everything all right? I don't know what karma I got, Doctor. I don't know what curse it is. A woman with no husband gave birth to me. And the same with my daughter. And now... Now my great grand-daughter will share the same fate. Until when will this curse last in my family, Doc? Ma'am. Believe me. That curse won't continue. The way is by stop talking about the past. Instead, talk about positive things to your great grand-daughter. And I... I will break that curse. I ask for your permission... ...to recite the azan to your great grand-daughter. I realized more about the importance of family in our lives. And my story doesn't have to be the same as my Dad's. It's time for me to step forward into new days. Even though I may be limping. Peace be upon you, Fira. Dad. Someone told me... ...that soulmates are set by God. But God also wants... ...the soulmates that He has chosen for us to be searched for, and chosen. Because what's precious isn't waiting. What's precious is the effort. This isn't about waiting. But it's more about sacrifices and the fight to get your soulmate. The bigger your effort is, the better your soulmate and partner will be. How will I know if someone is my soulmate? You'll just know it. You're going tomorrow? Pray for me, Dad. So that I will also have an amazing story like you and Mom. Amen. If God is willing. - Peace be upon you, Fira. - Peace be upon you too. Yes, Gia. Are you the one wearing glasses with a red suitcase? Yes, that's right. - Where are you? - I'm at your 10 o'clock. Wow. I like the color red. Like your clothes. Oh gosh. That's not me. Hey, I'm next to her! Hi. Gia. Sorry. My uncle should've been here with us to pick you up. But because he's ill, turns out he can't come. What is your uncle's illness? His gout got worse. But my uncle does go to the hospital a lot. He was treated at the hospital once when they put him on... What is it called? Those tubes. - Ventilator? - That's it! You're a doctor. That's why you know. That reminds me of my patient. Mrs. Karmiti. Why? Yes, Doctor. I'm ready to fulfill all those conditions. Marida. Ardian. I only have two choices. Saving your Mom, or saving your futures. And remember... ...don't be a failure, like your Dad here. And please... Please don't think... ...that I'm killing your mother. No, Dad. We won't. I swear to God. Yes, Dad. I swear, too. In the name of God, the merciful and compassionate. In the name of God, the merciful and compassionate. Forgive me, Dear. Mom. Forgive me. Forgive me, Dear. Nurse Leni. The patient is still responding. Get the Ambu bag. Sir, excuse me. Please. Excuse me. Turn on the oxygen. What happened to Mom? Doc... All praise be to God. She's still breathing by herself. - All praise be to God. - Really, Doctor? - She's still alive, sir. - Thank you, Doctor. Oh my God. And who would have thought... ...that until now, her condition is improving. And... Sorry, Gia. I'm someone who gets easily emotional. I'm embarrassed. That is what God wills. That's a miracle. That's the greatness of God. After that, I asked the nurse to conduct an analysis of her blood gas test. To make sure about the levels of oxygen in her blood. And the results came out normal. It's true... ...that God is the best screenwriter. At the point where Mr. Broto had given up... ...and willing to accept his wife being taken by God... ...God gave her back instead. Do you realize that if that ventilator was taken off just one day earlier... ...it probably would be a different story. So the timing was perfect. It's like a bruise. From a collision. The blood clot would disappear. And dissolve into the body again. It's the same like a heart that is frozen. It can melt thanks to God's power. This is my house, Gia. Let's go in. How was your flight? It was safe up there, right? No problems happened? Thankfully, all went smoothly up there, Sir. I see. Sorry, this is just tea. We usually give juice, right? Bitter bean juice. You're funny. Right. - Let's drink. - Thank you. - I'm going to drink this. - Please do. It's so sweet. Like you, Dear. You're smart with words. So, you know Herman from his time in the Netherlands? In Lyon, Ma'am. In France. That brother of mine is weird. He likes throwing tantrums. Yeah. Hey, Dear. Has Fira finished taking a bath yet? I have, Dad. My goodness. You're dressed up nicely now. Why would you want to introduce yourself to Herman? Sorry, Sir. What was your question? I was just asking why would you want to introduce yourself to Herman? We didn't really introduce ourselves to each other. I was just helping him with his boils. - Boils? - Boils. The boils brought a blessing, Dear. More precisely, the boils connect people together. Right? So you two got to know each other because of boils? Yeah. Why did you choose to be a doctor? Why didn't you want to be a pilot like your Dad? I actually wanted to be an astronaut, Sir. But because I had problems with my eyes, I couldn't. Thank God, He gave me the path of becoming a doctor. Thank God. I have a problem with my ankle. What's wrong with your ankle? It can't see. (ankle = mata kaki = "eye of foot" literally) - It can't. - Dad... Where do you work, Fira? I work at the bank as a teller. Her job is counting the money of the rich. The problem is, all she does is counting. But she doesn't become rich herself. Please, Sir. Please. You'll be the imam for me, my wife, and Fira. Just recite short surah. The ones you can recite. Please. - Okay, Sir. - Okay. Fir. Do you like Game of Thrones? I don't really like games. When I play a game, I'd play... Angry Birds. That one. Huh? No. I mean... ...Game of Thrones, the series. No, I don't. I thought you're talking about that famous game. What was the name? Mobile Legends. Okay. How about the Premier League? Which team do you like? MU? Liverpool? Arsenal? Or... Surabaya. Persebaya (Football Club of Surabaya). If its soccer, I root for the local teams. I don't get why people could choose to support teams from England. They're not friends. They're not related. They're not even from the same country. Why support them? Right? You have a point. Gia. I wonder what it feels like to be an astronaut up there. It must feel lonely. I don't know. But surely, it's amazing. Did you know that the number of stars up there in the sky... ...is a lot more than all the grains of sand on the face of this Earth? - Let's go. - Let's. - Huh? - What is it? Oh, no. It broke. It broke. And this is my favorite shoe. Not only humans. Items also have an end. Maybe it is time for your shoes to retire. It's okay. I'll accompany you. You're a fun person. Gia. Truthfully, when I met you, I didn't know what to say to you. After what happened to me. What happened to you? Huh? Uncle Herman didn't tell you anything? How do I say this... Honestly... ...I didn't talk to him that much. I was just asked to come here and meet you. The truth is... ...today should be my wedding day. Fir, you don't need to talk about this. If you're not comfortable... It's okay. I think you need to know this. I already printed the invitations. Had the pre-wedding photos. Ordered the catering. Reserved the building. And it was cancelled. It wasn't happening. He's also a doctor. Just like you. Also in Jakarta. He's a doctor? - Where does he work? - I don't know. Do you have a photo of him? Wait. I'm not sure if I still have it or not. Here he is. This is Ivan, right? You know him? I don't know him personally, but that time at the hospital... - Don't touch me. - Sir, calm down. So we can treat you. Oh God. I don't need you people. I only want my lover, who is a doctor, who can treat me. Don't speak nonsensical, Sir. We can't just have an outside doctor in this hospital. And you just broke up with that person. That person's not your lover anymore. Joni! I already sent a WhatsApp message. That person will be here soon. Tell that person to come quicker, Jon! That's enough. Sir, listen. Don't make other people's lives difficult just because your girlfriend who's so pretty... ...who you keep idolizing, is marrying someone else! Ino? Ivan! - Ivan. - What happened to you? It's not about what happened to me. Where were you? I'm not getting married. I can't stand you leaving me. - You're not lying? - I'm serious. Don't be like that again. - Yes, I'm sorry. - I don't like it when that happens to me. - Yes. - Oh gosh. "Who's so pretty", Doc? I also got rejected recently. I got rejected when I was going to propose to her. We're the same. Oh, well. We don't have to keep remembering the sad things. It'll only hurt us. Let's just go home. Let's go. No need to think about it. Thank you. - Until we meet again. - You're welcome. Until we meet again. Peace be upon you. Peace be upon you too. Gia, sorry. I didn't do that on purpose. I... I didn't do it on purpose. It's a habit of mine. - You need to go in. - Right. It's already time. I'm worried you'll be late. Peace be upon you. Peace be upon you too. Oh gosh. What are you thinking? So what actually are soulmates? Your question, Gia, is harder than the test for civil servant candidates. Some people have been married for decades. But they can still separate. Maybe that's the problem. Because they avoided this question. Don't bait me with a question like this. Honestly... ...I'm not ready to be with anyone. Yes, Fir. I understand. We're actually the same. You're broken, I'm broken. We met when we were both broken. But isn't it better to be heartbroken... ...than marrying the wrong person? If we were never heartbroken... ...would we be honest with ourselves? What's the answer? - About soulmates? - Yeah. What I know is that lately, I haven't been honest with myself. My heart wasn't sincere in my sacrifices. Me too, Gia. I was swayed too. I felt that my life was full of blessings. I got a rich boyfriend. He's handsome and a doctor. What girl wouldn't be happy? Even though all of my friends warned me. I continued to lie to myself. I didn't want to hear what my friends said. Thank you. Gosh! What's with you? - Thank you for what? - For making me realize... ...what kind of wife I'm looking for. Even if you don't want to be my soulmate. You eavesdrop on our daughter. It isn't good! You too! I was just following you. - Go. - You go first. - No. - You! - Mom. - Fira. Fira. Not all doctors are bad, right? I'm sure that Gia is different. Maybe he's the answer to all of your prayers? Every time you pray. I don't know, Mom. Just try to ask your heart about Gia. The answer is already there, right? And one more thing. I like that boy. Peace be upon you, Gianne. Go home now? What happened? It's an emergency? - What emergency is it? - What took you so long, Gia? No need to ask so much. Just see for yourself. - What is it? - Just see. - You're so weird. - Finally. The one we're waiting for is finally here. Fira? You came here? You're not the only one who's surprised. Your Dad and I were also surprised. We just found out that Gianne and Fira have known each other for a long time. - Oh, yeah? - Yeah. There are activities between universities. So I often meet Fira. And Dad didn't tell me from the beginning that the person that Gia was meeting is Fira. It's a secret between men. - Why are you taking so long? - Be patient. It's about our assignments. This is important. Next time you ask me to pick you up, you'll have to pay. - I'll go home now. Peace be upon you. - Peace be upon you too. Bye. Let's look at this one. - That was actually Fira? - Yes. Maybe God already hinted that you two are soulmates. But what else could be done? You only thought about Elsa. - Right? Admit it. - You're right. But it's true that love is blind. The proof is that my brother willingly became a slave of love. Ouch! Okay, then. I'm borrowing your book, okay? Huh? You like reading Game of Thrones? No, it's just to prop up the table. The size is just right. I have to admit... ...that Gianne is right this time. It could be that our soulmates are right in front of our eyes. But unfortunately, we didn't realize it. But is it true... ...that Fira is my destined soulmate? Fir. Don't talk to Gianne too much. You'll end up being weird like her. Alright. But your family is fun like mine. They're rowdy too. That's how they are. It could be a blessing or a disaster. It depends on the situation. Hey. You never told me that you were friends with my sister. I saw your profile picture on Facebook. There's a photo of you and Gianne. So I asked Gianne. And I wanted to go to Jakarta to surprise you. I'm happy that you came. You're smart with words. Okay, then. Go inside. Okay. Gia. Tomorrow evening... ...do you have plans? Why? I'm really curious about Mrs. Karmiti and Mr. Broto. I want to meet them in person. If you want to accompany me. Sure. I'll take you there. Tomorrow evening, okay? - Coincidentally, they live near the hospital. - Really? If you want, we can meet at the hospital where I work. Sure. Thank you, Gia. You're welcome. - I'll go in. - Okay. - Peace be upon you. - Peace be upon you too. Excuse me. - Yes? - Is Dr. Gia here? Speak of the devil. There he is. Dr. Gia. Fira. - Hi. - Hi. You came. Are you okay with waiting for a bit? I won't be long. It's alright. Relax. So this is the girl who stopped Dr. Gia from becoming a zombie. You have a new girl now, Doc? See? The zombie is staring at me. Don't mind him. It's okay. Your friend is funny. Thank you, Miss. It hurts. Doc, we have an urgent patient. - Help my kid, Doc. - What happened to him, Ma'am? - A corn kernel went into his nose, Doc. - Gosh. Bring him to the bed immediately. Come on. - Yes. Stay strong. - It hurts. Come here. Let me carry you. Nurse Leni. Ready the equipment. - I don't want to! - It's okay. - I don't want to! - I'll do it gently. Don't move around! - If you keep moving, it'll prick you. - I don't want to. - Hold still. Gosh. - I don't want to. Okay. I give up, see? I'm putting down the forceps. Doctor, there's a patient who had been in a car pileup. Okay, everyone, stand by. - How's the patient's condition? - There's one victim stuck behind the wheel, Doc. The patient experiences pain in the stomach. Blood pressure is 80/40, Doc. Can you handle this? - I can. - Bring him to Room 1. Stabilize him and then do an X-ray. Do you like games? You like games? Then, let's play "who will last longer when they get tickled?" Help! It hurts! - What happened to him? - He experienced trauma. He broke the lower part of his right arm. - Nurse Melinda, can you handle this? - I can, Doc. Bring him to Room 2. Help. Tickle, tickle. - What happened to him? - This is the last patient, Doc. His leg almost got amputated. And he's losing blood. Okay. Bring him to Room 3. Nurse Leni, help me. Endure this just for a bit, okay? Tickle, tickle. Come on, endure it. The corn came out. What is it? Why are you laughing? I remembered your face from that time. Was it that funny? That's the most amazing thing I've ever seen. That's how it is. It's like a war zone every day. Helping those who need it. You're scared of it, huh? No. Thanks for the memory. I can now appreciate more what doctors do. Peace be upon you. Mr. Broto? Peace be upon you too. - Oh God. - Mr. Broto. How are you? Gosh. I'm fine. Please, come in. Come in, miss. Please. Sorry. We can only offer this, it's unworthy of a doctor. Especially a doctor who was so kind to me. It's okay. Seeing you healthy like this already makes me so happy. By the way, Doc, if I may know... ...why did you suddenly come here? I apologize in advance, Mr. Broto and Mrs. Karmiti. Allow me to introduce myself. I'm Fira. This is just a social visit, we apologize if we're intruding. So, are you Dr. Gia's wife? No. Maybe they just got engaged. Doc. As someone older... ...I want to give a suggestion. Marriage is easy. What's hard is having a family, Doc. Because the sacrifices of having a family... ...can only be ended by death. And did you know this? The hardest part of having a family... ...is that we can't be ourselves anymore. All of the sacrifices will be for the kids, Doc. I would even give up my life for the future of my kids. My life is no longer just for me. If you already knew that having a family is hard... ...why did you two want to get married? Why do you want to go through all that? It's the way to worship God. Sacrifices are ways to worship God. - Please. - Please. - Okay. Thank you. - Please. - Please, Fira. - Thank you, Ma'am. Before the flies come. - Okay. Please. - I'll drink this. My Dad first saw my Mom when they were both little. But fate caused them to separate. And after decades, love brought them back together again. A long sacrifice. A long fight. Like Mr. Broto and Mrs. Karmiti. Their love is really amazing. It is. And extraordinary. What we experienced is nothing compared to their love. It's as if we were reprimanded and slapped by our own pasts. Thank God I failed getting married. Yeah. Thank God. This is protein. This vegetable is also protein. This cheese is protein. This chicken is also protein. Fir. Do you think that if we eat this chicken... ...is it possible that as a whole chicken, it'll walk around inside our bodies? Of course not, Gia. It'd tickle if it walked around inside our bodies. So it means that we have to chew this food. We have to crush the food as much as we can. Until the smallest particle of substance. For protein, we call it amino acid. The most important substance... ...to regenerate the cells of our body. You're saying that us being broken... ...are already in the form of the smallest particle? Like amino acid? - And then... - It'll form new cells. New organs. New heart. New lives. Even a new love. I think... ...disintegration can be the start of something beautiful. I accept this marriage with Syafira Imaniar, daughter of Hadi Prabowo... ...with the dowry of praying set and 15 grams of gold paid in cash. How was that, witnesses? - Is it valid? - It's valid. Thank God. In the name of God, the merciful and compassionate. - Dad. - Yes, Fira. No girl wants to go through difficult times. But every girl knows life isn't always full of flowers and rainbows. There will be storms in any form. You have two duties. The first is to make sure that you're not the one bringing the storm. And the second... ...you're the one who brings the flowers and the rainbows for her. Isn't that really great? Where are we going today, honey? To heaven! What heaven are you looking for the most? This food is called quenelle de lyon. It's the signature dish of this city. Let's eat! Cheers, honey. In the name of God... It's so good! Right? - I love you. - I love you more. You've been broken. I've been broken. But... ...you and I keep going. Going past our broken hearts. Looking for answers in all directions. And my search finally brought me to you. In your heart that knows longing. The warmth that can melt all the snow on this mountain. This journey... ...ended with you. Be it at the seventh heaven or the deepest trench, we have the right to be loved by the right person. dr. Gia Pratama
