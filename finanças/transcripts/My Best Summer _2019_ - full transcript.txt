[Mokexing Film] My name is Geng Geng. Geng as in "Geng Geng Yu Huai" (means "take to heart") When I recalled my high school life after many years, I forgot most of it. Everything is like a daily list with trivial little things, which was hard to be salvaged. I can't remember what we said and what we did. But, I remembered you. I remembered in those three years, no matter which direction I looked at, there was always you in my eyes. You always said that youth wouldn't last forever. Nevertheless, we, back then, were the best versions of ourselves. [My Best Summer] The year of 2008 was an extraordinary year, as what happened in that year were all extraordinary. The 2008 Olympic Games was successfully held in Beijing; the Shenzhou VII spaceship was blasted off into space; and the band, Mayday, after two years of waiting, finally released their 7th album. There's one more thing! I took the high school entrance exam. I was an ordinary student from an ordinary junior high school. I applied to Zhen Hua high school on an impulse, the best one in the city. My dad comforted me saying, "our goal is to keep the branch campus by paying our own tuition." However, even in his wildest dream did he expect that, I was admitted into the main campus of Zhen Hua High School. [Zhen Hua High School] (Recall the earlier years of High School) Geng Geng! I was telling you, "Impossible is nothing." "Just do it!" What does it mean? Nothing is impossible. We'll finish it! Help me take a photo. Come on. [Zhen Hua High School] Hurry! Her name is Jian Dan (means "simple"). She's been overly simple-minded since childhood. [Zhen Hua High School] We're classmates in primary school. When we were in fourth grade, she transferred to the experimental primary school in Hankou City. Who could have imagined that, after so many years, we are here together again. Sorry student, sorry! What... are you laughing at? Look! The name next to mine is "Geng Geng." Together is "Geng Geng Yu Huai" (means "take to heart"). You? Are you Yu Huai? Yep. Why are you staring at me? I'm Geng Geng. Then, we are classmates from now on. Geng Geng! Where have you been? I've been looking all over for you. Come! Let me introduce you to a new classmate. Betta! Let me introduce my friend, Geng Geng. We grew up together. I'm Jiang Niannian, they all call me, Betta. Nice to meet you! You know why we are meant to be good friends? Because we three have the worst grades in the class. Starting from today, in this class, three of us will be the "Bottom Sisters". What "Bottom Sisters"?! We are "Striking Sisters". Everyone, please be quiet! Welcome to the Zhen Hua High School. My name is Zhang Ping. I'm the class teacher of Class Five. If anyone has any question about this school, please try not to ask me. It's because I'm new here, too. All right! Let's assign seats first. - If you have a friend here and you want to sit together, - Jian Dan. I have no problem with it. I always prefer democracy. - Okay? - Okay. Let's start now. Geng Geng, I'm going to sit with the cute guy over there. Has everyone talked about their special requests? - Yes. - Wait, Teacher! I haven't said mine yet. Say it, then. I want to... sit with Geng Geng. Geng Geng? Who is Geng Geng? He is so tall that he has to sit in the last row. Do you also want to sit with him in the back? Yes, I do. [Welcome, new students!] Stop it! You kids are too young, don't get the wrong idea. Don't get it wrong! My name is Geng Geng, we are deskmates from now on. I'm not scared! Thank you everyone. Please welcome our excellent student representative, Sheng Huainan, to get on the stage and give a speech. Dear leaders, teachers and classmates... Did you see? The Legendary Sheng Huainan in Grade 11, he has been the pride of Zhen Hua. He's consecutively won the National Physics Olympic Competition twice. First place. But I heard the first place of the Competition this year is in our class. - Who? - Who? Your deskmate. Who? Him? Sh*t, he's sick! How could he be the Legend in Physics? - Teacher. - Xu Yanliang. Yu Huai is sleeping. Geng Geng, does your deskmate sleep well? Well. Are you supposed to take care of him? - "Senior High School Physics Competition Guide." - What? Stand up! Is this the place for sleeping? Teacher, I can't help it. What do you mean? Do you already know everything that I taught? If I didn't understand, I would listen. If I understood or wasn't interested, listening to it puts me to sleep. It's a biological reaction that I couldn't control. Very well! Explain this sentence to me then. "With a few cups of thin wine, how can I resist such gusty wind of late autumn?" It says after three cups of thin wine down the stomach, then... and then... the old-aged gout aches in a sudden. Quiet! Don't laugh! Be Quiet! Teacher, can I sit down? Get out! Stand outside the classroom! Do not bring anything! Get out! All right, let's resume the class. I haven't seen any standing punishment since I entered high school, - not to mention here in Zhen Hua High School. - Hello, Teacher. Yu Huai broke the record this time, having the first standing punishment in Zhen Hua High School. After the poet raised her cup, she couldn't help to drink down the wine with her nostalgia. However, she couldn't resist neither the coldness of the fitful autumn wind, nor the sorrow and loneliness in her mind. You'd better be reasonable. How could you sleep in the class and still act so arrogantly? I thought I was pretty reasonable. "Senior High School Physics Competition Guide" I really regret it now. Regret what? Being your deskmate. What should I do if you become unreasonable with me one day? Let me give you a tip. What is it? Listen up! It works all the time. You call me "My Lord" then. I will definitely let you go. Scram! See! My score is 98 every time, only 2 points to 100. Let me see. In Zhen Hua High School, scores mean everything. As a stupid student like me, I forget the formulas right after I memorize them. So I prefer to take photos of those beautiful moments that I don't want to forget. As long as I press the shutter, those images will never be washed away by time. The youthful days that they easily threw away, were all captured with my camera. But I left my own youth behind these photos. September is the golden month of autumn. The sky is clear and the air is cool. In such a pleasant season, the new semester begins. Over there! Geng Geng, I heard your deskmate became famous. I still can't believe it! That punk ranked the first of the whole grade in our mock exam. He is not human. Don't mention him again. I'm mad at him. What's wrong? Didn't we have an exam this morning? You saw that he was the first one to hand in the exam. So? So, his *ss. My exam paper was totally blank and he saw that, too. He definitely did it on purpose. It turned out I ranked No. 46 and he ranked No. 1. I don't get why he still mocked me. I'm dead this time. Don't worry! Just be patient with this. After you take a few more exams, you'll get used to it. It's none of your business. I realized that you were not a top student a long time ago. - Why? - Because you put on book covers. I must change my seat. Don't mind what he said! That's right, what goes around comes around. Yep, let's see how long he could keep showing off. Come on! Hurry up! What's cheering for? Haven't you seen anyone play basketball before? Do you still want to change your seat? Yes. Yes? She wants to change her seat, let's go! Let's find Zhang Ping now. - I will help you. Go! - Let's go. - I didn't mean it. - Let's go. No, no, no! I haven't made up my mind yet. Oh no! Don't play dumb with me. You don't want to leave him. Don't want to leave who? Him? This guy is... phony, cunning, arrogant, bossy, mean, harsh. Really... He is really... He is really handsome. Who did it? Who? Xinyue, wait for me! (Back to the present time) [2018 Wuhan] Jian Dan, can you take the ferry with me sometime? It's too slow and takes too much time. It takes half an hour to cross the river. I like it slow. The slower, the better. What made you come back and enjoy your life here? Our studio in Wuhan has taken a project, the client wants me to be in charge. If you're not in a rush, you might catch the 7th anniversary reunion party of our high school. Oh gosh! We've graduated for seven years already. Geng Geng, I heard... Yu Huai came back from the U.S. Our daughter is back. You are here. Mom. You're always like this. Why didn't you tell me earlier that you're coming back? You dad and I didn't even have time to get groceries. Geng Geng, your room is cleaned up. I'll go to help your mom first. (Recall the earlier years of High School) Why is the lens so dusty? Stop pretending! You flashed me with this camera, right? You made me miss the shot so you owe me an apology. Why should I apologize to you? I was just taking photos there. It's you who bombed into my photo. You ruined my composition that I tried so hard to get. It's you who owed me an apology. All right, you win! - Come back! - You have to let me take a look at my photos, at least. Oh no! You took terrible photos of me. - It's because you are ugly. - Let me see it again. This one is too dark, I barely see anything. - What's the point of taking the photo of a wire pole? - Give it back! What the heck is this? A weasel? It's a squirrel. Give it back! Give it back to me! Give it back to me! Let me see the rare photo of us together. It looks awful, I already deleted it. Though you both are in the Physics Competition Class, Sheng Huainan is so much more of a gentleman. Do you like him? Who doesn't like a good-looking guy? I have to remind you, that guy already has a girlfriend. I'm just saying. He is my buddy. I can help you connect to him, if you don't mind being a mistress. Yu Huai, you're a jerk! Geng Geng. Geng Geng. Let me see. It's bleeding. Why are you so silly? It's none of your business. Do you think I have nothing to do? I'm the one suffer the most if anything happens to you, okay? Give me your "paw!" If you're not here, who would save me a seat when I'm late? Who would watch for me when I sleep? Are you treating me as your buddy? Then, you have to protect me. Deal! Starting from today, I will protect you. Starting from today, let me protect you. Who needs your protection, idiot! All right, let's get this straight. Your hand got hurt, then he put on the band-aid for you? Then he also said, if anything happens to you, he'll suffer a lot. And then he said he would protect you from now on. Not like that, he just randomly said it. He must like you. You all like me. Don't act like you don't understand what we said. It's not the same kind of "like." It is not the kind of "like" between friends. - It is the complicated kind of "like." - That's impossible. Then why do you look so embarrassed? No, I don't. What if he does like me, what should I do? Just try it out, then! Step A, well, "rescuing the damsel in distress." All men love to show off so you just say your bike is broken. If he likes you, he will definitely offer you a ride back home. When you sit in the back of his bike, with two hands holding his waist... Betta, you sound like a creep. But the problem is my bike is just fine, how can I fake it? You're so stupid sometimes. Then say you lost the key. But I didn't. Oh my God! - You... - Now, it's lost! - What did you do? - Yu Huai, see you around. I'll leave. Geng Geng, what are you doing here? You look sneaky. - I lost my bike key. - You lost your bike key? Where did you lose it? Let me help you find it. It's okay. You can't find it. Because... I've already looked everywhere. I looked into every corner but still couldn't find it. - Where did I lose it? - You're so stupid. All right, let me send you home. What did I say? So romantic! Don't lose your key again! Hello? - Are you home? - I'm on the bus. What?! Why is he like that? Maybe it's just my own illusions. Stop. Stop. - What are you doing? - Stop. Stop. Sir. Please... Please stop the bus. - Are you out of your mind? - Sorry. Are you out of your mind? Are you a moron? Indeed, I was. I didn't realize until you got on the bus. I should have taken you home on my bike. Who came up these sick questions? Are you giving up this soon? It's none of your business. Your score is so bad. Nobody else will help you if I don't. Why are you pretending to be good to me? You are the one under my protection. Am I? I'm hungry. Step B. "Alcohol loosens the tongue." No, what do you mean? He will tell you everything if he is drunk. No way! - Doesn't this sound terrible? - You have to take the risk! - Enjoy! - Thank you. Hurry, hurry, hurry! How can we drink beers here? You said you would protect me. How can you protect me if you can't even drink? At most, I can piggyback you home if you get drunk. Cheers! Bottoms up! You're heavy like a pig. You are a pig. You had to have the beef burger. Did I force you to eat it? I'm not your breeder. You haven't come to school for two days. Are you sick? This is Geng Geng. He is taking a sick day. Thank you for asking. This is Yu Huai's mom. I'm dead! Did I freak you out, moron? Why don't you just go to h*ll? I'm in the Physics Competition. I won't be able to come back this morning. Can I ask you for a favor? It's urgent. The Physics exercise notebook in my drawer belongs to your gentleman, Sheng Huainan. I promised to return it to him this morning. Can you help me do it? Ye Zhanyan. Let me see! Wait a minute. This... This is Sheng Huainan's notebook. Let me see, let me see. Who is Ye Zhanyan? You don't know her? She's the prettiest girl of our school. Boys chase after her, one after another. Hundreds of them show up on time everyday in order to leave footprints on her social network page. I heard there's a guy who has even bought her breakfast for a year. There's more, this guy didn't mention who he was. He just put it in her drawer secretly and then, hide away peeking at her when she ate the breakfast. He was found out later so everyone avoided him. They even called him "the freak." That is freaky! I'm telling you if it were me, I would cut him open. Be at ease! no one dares to buy you breakfast. - Except Xu Yanliang. - Get out! Get out now. Give it to me! Let's go! So the square root of seven is less than or equals to e, also less than or equal to the square root of ten. Does everyone understand it? Raise your hand if you don't! Okay, no question, then we'll move on. - Yu Huai. - Teacher, I don't understand the solution. Can you prove it again? All right, please look at the blackboard, everyone. He doesn't understand it? He doesn't even need to listen for this kind of question, does he? Go to Question 15 on your exam. Does anyone not understand this one? I don't, Teacher. Well, I'll talk about it again. Everyone, eyes on the blackboard. The right crossing point of the oval, F's coordinate is 20. Let M's coordinates be X1, Y1, N's coordinates be X2, Y2. From condition one, we can deduce condition two. - Did you get it, Yu Huai? - Yes. Everyone turns to Question 21. This one is so simple that I don't have to deduce it, isn't it? Teacher, I don't understand this question. Yu Huai, are you purposely fighting with me? Such a simple question and you are telling me that you don't get it? Who are you trying to trick? Teacher, I don't understand it, either. Me, neither. Me, neither. - I don't understand it either, Teacher. - Me, neither. - Me, neither - Me, neither. I don't know it, Teacher. All right, put your hands down. I will do it for the last time. You all better listen very carefully. I won't do it again. Class is over. I will ask the teacher myself if I have any questions. And if I still don't understand it, I'll ask you. Can you explain it to me then? Don't make the teacher think you're playing tricks. Also, as for the Physics exercise notebook, I am sorry! You can talk to me directly, why did you write to me? So silly! Okay, that's all the lessons for today. It will be the parent-teacher conference later. You all can leave now. Stand up! For students like us, parent-teacher meeting is the jaws of death. It depends on luck if we can pass it or not. Geng Geng. Mom. Why did you perm your hair? Do I look good? Is this your deskmate? How do you do, Auntie? My name is Yu Huai. Hello. I thought boys in your school are all nerds with glasses. I didn't expect that this boy looks pretty energetic. Mom. Hello, Auntie. I am Yu Huai's deskmate. My name is Geng Geng. Hello, Sister! I'm Geng Geng's mom. In this midterm exam, my Geng Geng has improved her ranking a lot. All thanks to Yu Huai for tutoring her. Thank you very much. Is this guy you found reliable or not? I'm telling you. I don't care. I will ask you for a full refund if it goofs up. That's it! - How's it? - When can I get the remaining payment? - What did the teacher say? - I'm in a hurry to go back. Jiang Niannian's dad. Let's exchange contact information. That is... Teacher Zhang, you can just take mine. Teacher Zhang. Hello. Teacher Zhang, it seems that you are busy so we won't bother you. Let's go! You can talk to my dad next time. Teacher Zhang, I'm Yu Huai's mother. Hello, hello. I'm here looking for you, I hope to ask you a favor, Teacher. Can you change Yu Huai's seat? His deskmate has a negative impact on his study. I don't like what you said. How can my daughter be worse than your son? Geng Geng's mother, calm down first, okay? Please let me handle it. Teacher Zhang, you probably don't know our family situation. My husband died long time ago. Studying is Yu Huai's only way out so he can't afford to waste it. Please, Teacher Zhang. Please change his seat. Yu Huai's mother, I understand your concern. It's not that. It's him... He lied to me. - He told me... - Mom. - I haven't finished yet. - Let's go! He told me that his deskmate is a good student. Until today, I found out her score is so bad. - Stop it! What are you talking about? - You know I don't want you to sit next to a bad student. - What are you talking about? You should stop now. - He had similar experience before. - When he was in junior high school, the girl sat next to him was a bad student, too. - Why are you telling Teacher Zhang all these? - I didn't expect the current one is even worse. - Mom, let's go! - No wonder you had to lie to me. - Let's go! Geng Geng. Geng Geng? Geng Geng! What are you doing? What are you doing? Why did you lie? Why did you say your deskmate is a good student? Did I embarrass you as your deskmate? Is it true that a dumbass like me can only be a bad influence, making you, the first place, become as bad as me? Just tell me how far I should stay away from you. Yu Huai. Don't you have something to say? Don't leave! You're right! I did lie. I had a deskmate in Junior High School. She was a transfer student. Because her score was bad, the teachers always yelled at her. You don't listen during classes, and you are distracted all the time. Look at you! You even dyed your hair. All classmates didn't like her. But I thought this was unfair to her. I screwed up the competition once. My mom thought it was because of her. So she came to school and forced the teacher to change her seat. My mom did this all because of me. She never listened to my explanation. So I lied to her. Because I want to... be your deskmate. Stop acting, Jiang Niannian. Why didn't you put some wasabi on the back of your hands? Do you look down on me? How can you still laugh?! You dared to hire a dad in the talent market. Teacher Zhang, I was wrong. I was truly wrong. Please forgive me this time. I know you're a temporary student (TN: she just studies there temporarily and will eventually go back to her original city) , you will go to Beijing for the exam some day. However, you haven't gone there yet, right? So we have to finish the process together, right? I'm not gonna expose you this time. But, don't betray me, either. No matter how you do in future exams, you should never lie again. You ask your parents to come to the parent-teacher meeting, I will talk to them in private to make sure they won't punish you too hard. Deal? You may leave. For this National Day Singing Competition, I want to give us a small goal. Let's fight for the top three but it is okay if we are at least top ten. We just can't be the last. Can we do this? Yes. Our Class Five doesn't have the best scores but we are good at a lot of other things. For example, Wen Xiaoxiao, Piano level 10. How many people in our school can achieve that? Am I right? But sons and daughters of the Chinese nation! Who would be willing to be slaughtered like pigs and goats?

Because the song we sung wasn't applied in advanced, which is against the competition rules. But Zhang Ping said, you guys did well. You did what you wanted to do. You had the courage to express yourself. I, Zhang Ping, didn't waste my time teaching this class. To be honest, I kind of envy Betta. She suddenly fell for her teacher just like that. Just like me, it's also a secret that we couldn't tell anyone else. But, she keeps it all bright and open. I just got the Third Place in the National Physics Competition. Really? Are you free tomorrow, Saturday? - What for? - Let me buy you dinner. Are you asking me out? Just ask me directly. Dear classmate Geng Geng, can I have the honour to take you out? It sounds too fake. Do it again! Dear classmate Geng Geng, can I have this honor? What's wrong? You don't like it? You look different today. Not bad! - Xu Yanliang? - Hello! Hello! Surprise! - Is everyone here? - Yes, everyone is here. Why you all... Yu Huai just won the National Physics Competition, Third Place. Shall we celebrate it... with joy and pride? Yes, yes! Xu Yanliang, you four-eyed idiot. You ruined my plan. You four-eyed third wheel, just you wait! Beat you to death! What did you have for lunch to make you that powerful? - Bye-bye! - Bye-bye! You look better with your hair tied up. I'm not pretty and I'm not good at studying, I also can't play the piano either. My parents don't have any expectations of me. I'm just dawdling. Nothing really matters. You're right, indeed. Hey! Aren't you supposed to comfort me? You can at least pretend to. Geng Geng, the first time I met you in front of the school notice board, I thought you were really cute. Now, you're giving me goosebumps. You know that feeling? It's like... I don't know how to say it. Actually, I've been wanting to tell you... Actually, I want to say... How's my acting? Aren't you moved? I'm leaving now. Why didn't you remind me? I said I'd buy you dinner. What are you doing? So heavy! - I'm strangling you. - So heavy! You are so heavy. What is it? Hello everyone! This is your favorite program, "Hello Sisters." The steamed crayfish tastes great but it's so much trouble to peel it. You're just lazy. December 21, 2012 is going to be the doomsday. So our remaining days are three years and three months. - Did you peel this for me? - Don't you like it? - Forget it, then. - I like it. So do you know why the doomsday is on December 21, 2012? Excuse me, check please. Why does he talk about the doomsday out of nowhere? What's wrong? My stomach aches. Are you alright? I don't feel anything. Are you okay? Let's go. - We haven't paid yet. - I will pay later. If there were a doomsday, it would never be in the summer. Because summer is the best season. Summer is when you skip classes with someone, get wet in the rain together, and listen to the rustling sound of leaves in the breeze together. Just like we keep running on the road like this, we don't have anything to worry about. We will neither grow up nor grow old. All the beautiful things will never fade away. Your hand that is holding my hand, will never be loosened. (Back to the present time) Hello Geng Geng. Are you home? What? Miss me already? What day is our high school reunion? Big Sister, are you dumb? Who still buys real estate in Mainland China? Both house and land are permanent properties. The careless girl Betta used to be, does research and investment in real estate everyday. Xiao Xiao, how dare you drink when you're pregnant? It's all right, I'm only a surrogate mother. The simple girl from seven years ago, Jian Dan, is still terribly simple. Really? Is surrogacy reliable? Still as simple as she used to be. I'm telling you that I hired a top student from Harvard University. Buying our product is like doing finance management. Take a look, Geng Geng! The class leader become the kind of old classmate that nobody wants to stay in touch with. He doesn't even give up the chance - of selling his insurance at our reunion. - You're all my family. I will give you a huge discount if you buy it from me. How about you? Are you still the same as you used to be? Let us... - Cheers! - Cheers! Dear classmates, our friend Geng Geng has disappeared for years. She's joining our reunion for the first time. - Shall we interrogate her? -Yes, we shall. But I have to say it first, if you don't want to answer, that's fine, but you have to drink as punishment. - Okay. - Come on! We haven't asked any questions yet! How could you forget me? - Yu Huai? - Gosh! We're all waiting for you. Here's your seat! Sorry, everyone! I came late so I'll drink this as punishment. How have you been? (Recall the earlier years of High School) That's all for today. Everyone has to fill this form. Think about it seriously when you go home and talk to your parents carefully. Turn it in after you've filled it. [Zhen Hua High School Class of 2008] [Second Year Class Placement- Humanities or Sciences] Girls are better off picking Humanities. She can apply for Journalism major in the future, - or a language major. - Right! If that really doesn't work, she can be a teacher. Work is stable and there are winter and summer breaks, too. Science is too hard for a girl and it also won't be easy to find a job. I was top three of the grade in our school. - We're thinking for your own good. - Why should a girl study civil engineering? - Learning Science will burn you out. - You'll be very tired. - It'll be very hard. - Why study engineering, are you a girl or not? - If you go into the society, it'll be hard for you to find a job. - They only hire males and not females. My parents want me to study Humanities but Yu Huai picked Science. What should I do? Yu Huai picking Science is self-explanatory. He will end up attending Tsinghua University or Peking University. But if you study Science, that'll be suicide. Is it worth it just to be with him? That's why people say, monkeys like picking peaches instead of picking up peaches. Men are like monkeys. You have to make yourself better so that they will reach up to you. Definitely don't make him bend down to pick you up! If I was a fruit, I fear that Yu Huai wouldn't need to jump, he probably would have to bend down to pick me up. I don't want him to bend down for me. I want to be the fruit on the very top of the tree. I also want to see the view from up high. I want to feel the wind on the high ground. Then I will wait calmly. I will wait for the monkey who jumps up to get me. Dear classmates, starting from today our Class Five will be the Science class. From now on, we'll keep the current seating arrangements. Does anyone have any questions? No. Yu Huai, let's be deskmates forever, alright? You have to take care of me. I will rely on and blame you if I don't get into universities. That's right! If you don't get into one, just rely on him. I know that whether it be my future or him, it may not repay me for my stubbornness. However, when I see his undefended smile, it's all worth it. I'm sorry, okay? Dad, I will work hard and get into a university in Beijing by myself. It's all because of you! Your complained too much! You see? Our daughter has become crazy. No? (Back to the present time) Do you still remember that lucky charm? I told you to tape it so that it would be waterproof. But what good is that? The color will fade some day. It'll be washed off. Your alcohol tolerance is still so light. I'm not drunk. Do you believe me, I still can strangle you. Come! I'm going to set the timing. (Recall the earlier years of High School) Ready? Quick, quick, quick! The trees here in Late Autumn Hill are so dense. I heard many people come here to plant trees, then they would make a wish. If the tree grew, the wish would come true. Why didn't you tell me earlier? I would have brought some saplings. Don't be so superstitious. Look at all these trees here. If all these wishes came true, how could there be so many unhappy people in the world? I'm wondering... Can Oreos really make my poop black? You go and try it at home. If you eat five donuts, you can probably poop out an Olympic flag. Betta! Let's have a drink! - Cheers! - Cheers! - Cheers! - Cheers! What kind of tree is this? I don't know. Water it less. It'll be dead. Let's go! - Don't you want to make a wish? - I did it already. - That's it? - What else do you want? Why don't I dig another hole and bury you, too? This is the tree you planted, you should mark it, at least. It's hard to say if it will survive. Let's just leave it here. You can come back in a few years, just pick the tallest and fullest one and pretend it's the one we planted together. How wonderful! In your logic, if you had kids, you'd just thrown them on the streets and after 18 years, just pick the best looking ones from students who were the best in their college entrance exams. You'd point to those random kids and say that this is your kid, and make him take care of you when you're old? That's a good idea, actually! Let's go, already! Yu Huai, Let us be deskmates forever. Everyone, don't be annoyed with me! But I have to emphasize it again. Fill out the bubble sheet as soon as you finish your multiple choice questions, and do not mess up the lines. After you made sure you filled out the right ones, you can move on to fill-in-the-blank questions and essays. Every year, there are always some idiots who forget to fill their bubble sheets. You should be very, very careful about this. Do you hear me? Yes. Do you have any more questions? I even haven't cried yet, why are you crying? As you know, it's also my first time teaching a class. You pissed me off so much sometimes that I wish I could just burn down the classroom. On the other hand, you are so adorable when you behave yourselves. I thank you all. Farewell, my high school times. I really love summer. I love it, too. If there were really a doomsday, That day... would definitely never be in the summer. You're home. What? One last thing, still! A lucky charm for you. The College Entrance Exam is still four days away. What should I do with it in shower? Tape it! Tape is waterproof. Good luck! I want to go to college in the same city with you. I don't know. Geng Geng, I... Actually I want to... tell you... Good luck with the exam. We'll talk about the rest later. We'll have all the time in the world. I'll be waiting for you. We promised each other that we would meet in front of the school on the day when exam results came out. I ended up waiting for you until dark but you never showed up. I went to your house and found out that you had moved. You just disappeared and your phone number was suspended. I looked for you the whole summer. (Back to the present time) Afterwards, I heard you didn't do well on the exam. You went to the No.11 High School to retake your last year again. I even wrote you letters. Did you get them? Yes, I did. Then why didn't you call me back? I understand. If I were you, I wouldn't want to see other people, either. It's not a big deal when you disappeared. I never blamed you for that. But why did you hide from me the whole time? Geng Geng. Yu Huai. Don't you like me? What is this tattoo about? It's late! I have to go. I'm going back to the U.S. in two days. Yu Huai! Answer me one last question. Seven years ago, the very last day we met, you wanted to say something to me before we bid farewell. What was it? I don't remember. In this world, the total sum of love is constant. Some gain it when others lose it. It's fair. Classmate Jiang Niannian, how come you're so sentimental now, too? Aren't I comforting this idiot here? Geng Geng, what are you being restless for? Come! Let me show you something interesting. Come and sit right here. - What is this? - Just come over! Get closer. Closer. Move over a bit. Hurry. - Ready? - I can't see it. Ready? I'm recording now. Why didn't you say that earlier? I thought you were taking a photo. Jian Dan, you say something first. Betta, congratulations on getting out of this troublesome place. What do you mean? Let me tell you. If it wasn't for you all, I wouldn't bother going to school every day. Why was I so stupid back then? When did you record this? - Late Autumn Hill! Don't you remember? - We'll always be the Bottom Sisters! The. Bottom. Sisters. Teacher Zhang Ping, thank you! Thank you. Old Geng Geng, have you become an excellent photographer? Will it be difficult to get your autograph? Don't be too full of yourself! Four-eyes, have you made a great fortune? If you haven't, don't come find me. Also, don't you dare let someone else have Betta. If you still haven't confessed your feelings to her yet, you can go and kill yourself. Future Betta, you can end up with anyone but Xu Yanliang. Remember this! Do you have to be that coldblooded? I was... just fooling around back then. You can play any trick as your wish? You can have fun as your wish? How are you still living today? Future Jian Dan, I have no idea what you'd become in the future. Nevertheless, even if all your friends end up in different places of the world, you have to forever and always be with them. No matter what happens, stay friends forever. - Don't worry, young Jian Dan, we definitely will. - Stay together forever! Are you all morons? How can we be together forever? - Stay together and forever, forever, forever! - Forever, forever, ever! Do you remember the younger you back then? Stay together and forever, forever, forever! That person back then was the best version of you. The person I am now is the best version of me. Between the best versions of ourselves, there's a gap full of our entire youth. A youth that we'll never be able to catch up to. Goodbye. Yu Huai. Goodbye! - Goodbye! - That's enough. Seven years, he disappeared for seven years without a trace. If he cared about you just a little bit, would he be this cruel? He is just an *sshole. He is not an *sshole but a good actor. What do you mean? Why do I feel like there's a hidden meaning to your words? Sit down. Sit down! Why do I feel like you've been hiding something from us? Talk to us! Yu Huai never went to the U.S. What do you mean he didn't go to the U.S.? He was indeed admitted by a college in the U.S. but he couldn't afford the tuition. His mother... got uremia. When did this happen? Right before the College Entrance Exam. How did you know? One day, his mother was in the hospital, I ran into him. [The Central Hospital of Wuhan] It was around the mock exam. I am sorry. This illness I have, all they can do is giving me drugs and injections. When is this all going to end? Let me be discharged from the hospital. They sold the house for his mother's treatment. Yu Huai applied to a professional college. He got a job before he even graduated. He's been taking care of his mom while working. He couldn't go anywhere. In order not to affect you on your College Entrance Exam, he acted hard, like everything was fine. If all these wishes came true, how could there be so many unhappy people in the world? After you left, he went through so many different channels to find out how you were doing. Excuse me, where is the patient on Bed 41? He drank with me when he was upset. [Discharge Form] Then he started to cry when he was drunk. He heard you were doing well. He was too ashamed to see you. It's hot, drink it slowly, mom. Drink it slowly. Get some rest. Didn't you go back to the U.S. two days ago? I'm in the hospital right now. They said you discharged two days ago. You never went to the U.S. Why did you hide from me? So much has happened, why didn't you tell me anything? Geng Geng. We are not deskmates anymore. The lives we used to have are over. It's not over. How could it be over? The girl I used to be was so ordinary but you never gave up on me. I've become who I am today because of you. Geng Geng, you've become much better now. But I... I... I... I'm no longer your deskmate, I'm not the Yu Huai I used to be. Everything is over now. Please do not call me anymore. Yu Huai. Yu Huai? Yu Huai. Do you still remember when you were a kid, I brought you to the aquarium. When you saw the fish in the tank, they swam back and forth, you had such a big smile on your face. Now I want nothing... I just want to see you smile. This is your favorite program, "Hello Sisters." - This is Xiao Hou. - This is Qin Hao. Today we have a VIP guest, the famous singer Mister "the Freak." Hello everyone, this is the Freak. Hi guys! How are you? We're honored to have the Freak in the house today. The most popular and top-ranking song during this summer. Sir, can you turn it up a bit? A lot of audience have the same question as I do. Where did you get your inspiration for this song? I liked a girl in my class back in high school, for three years. I made a decision on my graduation day. I remember it was raining so hard that day, and I stood in the school field singing loudly to our classroom window. I sang one of my original songs to her. - Did your school expel you? - Almost! Fortunately there was this guy, he pulled me out in the rain. Because then, it just so happened that my school was preparing for National Day Singing Competition. He said "if you dare," "then get on the stage with me and sing." I asked him then, why would I do that? He said... He said "I also have a girl I really like" "but I'm afraid to sing a song for her in front of so many classmates." "So could you do me a favor and sing with me?" "Sing with me on the stage for her." Geng Geng, Actually I want to... tell you... The very last day we met, you wanted to say something to me before we bid farewell. What was it? I don't remember. It's not like you don't know. I just like saying things that I don't really mean. Did the girl know about it later? Probably or probably not. But I think sometimes being in love with someone is like that. You secretly liked her but you kept hiding all your feelings deep in your own heart. So this song by the Freak is very suitable for those who are quietly waiting and caring for their loved ones. That's right! As long as you still like her, do not give up your hope till the end. You asked me, what was it that I wanted to say. Wait, Teacher Zhang! I want to sit with Geng Geng. I want to tell you. Starting from today, let me take care of you. I like you. I like you very much. Give it back to me! It's so ugly, I already deleted it! But I couldn't make myself tell you. Stop! Stop. I don't understand it, Teacher. Such a simple question but you don't get it? Are you playing with me? Later on, I just realized I haven't held your hand yet. Let's go! Even if it's a lie, I still want to hold your hand just once. You said, if there was a doomsday, it definitely wouldn't be in the summer. But summer will end some day, too. Let's be deskmates forever, okay? I really want to walk through life with you but I might not be able to make it to the end with you now. I also have a girl I really like. But I'm afraid to sing a song for her in front of so many classmates. Can you do me a favor? Sorry! I have to lie to you, a very, very big lie. You won't hate me, will you? But hating someone is still better than missing someone. Geng Geng, you will certainly become the best version of you and then you will meet the right one. That is the happiness you deserve. Even if I disappeared from your life, you have to stay strong and carry on. I really want to accompany you to the end. - Stay together and forever, forever, forever! - Forever, forever, ever! ♫ It's another midsummer ♫ ♫ Once in a while, will you miss me? ♫ ♫ Do you still have regrets? ♫ ♫ Why aren't you saying anything? ♫ ♫ I really hate growing up ♫ ♫ I've learned ways to hide my feelings ♫ ♫ Silently standing by the phone, tears in my heart keep falling ♫ [I will be waiting for you at Late Autumn Hill.

Look! The name next to mine is "Geng Geng." Together with my name... is "Geng Geng Yu Huai" (means "take to heart"). This is where our stories began. Just let us start over again here. For the sake that I took this to heart all these years.

Protect her like a knight. The person I like, she wants to attend the University of Hong Kong but my score isn't enough. - I will do my best. - Sometimes when we do our eye care routines, I will look at her. What I'd like more is the two of us discussing philosophy questions together. I really like giving her toys. I joined his Ultraman (Japanese animated series) team. He's Cerro. I'm Ultrawoman. There was one day when he just kept staring at me. I just suddenly realized that I kind of like him. If I like her, then I get really shy. Everything she does really affects my mood. Even waiting for her outside her dorm is something to be very happy about. When picking a lipstick color, I learned to avoid the deadly Barbie pink. Kiss him. I would sit together with the friends I like. If you like someone, bring her to an escape room to have fun. Because if you're not there, then she won't be able to escape. I want to have meals with her and go to sleep with her. Fold small notes and give it to him. If I like someone, I would write letters to him. Bone writing or inscriptions, I'd write a love letter like that. It's when we're walking down the street and I unconsciously hold her hand. I just like... ♫ happiness ♫ ♫ Should next be written ♫ - We've been married for 30 years. - It's been 42 years. - It has almost been 60 years. - He'd feed fruit to me.
