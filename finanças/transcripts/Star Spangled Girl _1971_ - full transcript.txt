It's a lot bigger than I thought it would be. MAN: Yes, ma'am. It sure is pretty, though. Isn't it? MAN: Yes, ma'am! Are you just visiting Los Angeles or are you gonna live here? Don't know, ma'am. If things don't work out here better for me than it did in New York, I might just move on. (GIGGLES) Nitty Gritty , Mister? Take your hands off the car. It's all here, what's wrong with this country. You better open your eyes man. It's all going to be over soon. Take your hands off the car. The hypocrisy, the decadence, the corruption, it's all on the Nitty Gritty, man. I said, take your hands off the car! Plus two pages of photos of a love-in in Big Sur. Give me a copy, and then take your hands off the car. Come on, Norman. Call. (TELEPHONE RINGING) Yes? Yes. Who? Who you want? Shapiro? No Shapiro here. This is Hip Woo Laundry. No Shapiro works here. Yes, please. I'd like this by Thursday. Starch? No starch. Look very clean. (CHUCKLING) I rinsed them out, but you can do it again. And this is for the stuff I brought in last week. $2.60. You do terrific work. They always feel like brand-new shirts to me. (CHUCKLING) (DOG BARKING IN THE DISTANCE) (KNOCKING) Hello. Anyone here? AMELIA COOPER: Oh, hi! I hope I didn't disturb you. I'm Amelia Cooper from Cypress Gardens, Florida. I wrote you about renting a room, (CAT MEOWING) and this is my cat, Buster. (CASH REGISTER DINGING) (WOMAN SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY) I'll be starting to work in the morning at the YWCA, and I wrote to you in the letter, I'm a swimming instructor. I used to be an underwater guide at Cypress Gardens but, uh, I'm really here to train under Dr. Fernley, UCLA. He's the best swimming coach in the country, you know, and I'm going to have to work awful hard if I want to make next year's Olympic team. You interested in swimming Mrs. MacKaninee? Now look, if I talk too much, you just tell me. But I always think the way to get to know people is to talk and I like to get to know... I'm in love. (CASH REGISTER DINGING) (BURPING) Mrs. MacKaninee, I know you think I'm a very weird human being, but did you just walk by here with a terrific-smelling person? Not to say, you're not a terrific smelling person, but the person you were with had an odor that is particular and unique to my own personal chemically constructed needs. See, all of us have certain basic requirements when it comes to the opposite sex, namely, small hands, green eyes, large behinds. Where is she, Mrs. MacKaninee? Who was she, I'll sniff her out myself. Can't you give me a break? I don't need a bag. 51 cents, please. Thank you. (CARTON RATTLING) (MRS. MACKANINEE WHISTLING) Oh, good. Mrs. MacKaninee, you're in. I was looking for you. ANDY HOBART: Uh, listen I know the rent is due today and I have every intention of paying. Now I know I've given you lots of phony excuses in the past, but this one is really legitimate. (MUSIC PLAYING) My father, as you know, who hasn't been well, got better, but is not well again. Please, MacKaninee, I don't want to dance. I want to explain about my sick father. You see, he had this terrible pain in his side and... Mrs. MacKaninee, please, can I at least lead? (FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING) Norman! I'm home. I hope you're working, because I just sold my soul for this newspaper. Norman! All right, Norman. Where the hell are you? NORMAN: (ON RECORDER) Temper, temper. I'm out relaxing for a few minutes. I've been pounding the typewriter for eight consecutive hours. I am now capable of committing the perfect crime because I no longer have fingerprints. Oh, Mr. Karlson called. He says we owe him $230 for printing bills. He also said, if he doesn't get his money by Saturday, he's going to send his two large sons over to break our four skinny legs. I told him I'm just a writer and that you take care of the bills, so they're gonna break your legs and just sprain my ankle. I hope you brought food because I'm starving to death. The next sound you hear is my empty stomach gurgling. (MAKES GURGLING SOUND) (TELEPHONE RINGING) Hey, Martoni, how about a little service? (TELEPHONE RINGING) (ITALIAN ACCENT) Martoni's restaurant. Hey, Martoni, how about a little service? (ITALIAN ACCENT) Si, si. I'm a coming. Eh, no, no, no, no. It's no newspaper. It's Italian restaurant. I can keep this up as long as you can, Mr. Karlson. Hey, where were you so long? Did you bring anything to eat? I have five minutes to live. Should I put the dish on the floor, or will you try and eat like a normal person. Nuts? Pickles? Raisins? Don't you have any imagination? Get me some little Budapest sausages once in a while. My job is to keep you alive, not happy. If I'm not happy, I don't write well. If I don't write, we don't eat well. If we don't eat well, I'm not happy. Just finish your dinner and go back to work. Dinner? This is emergency relief food. Where do you see dinner? What did you get in the laundry today? Uh, huh? Oh, don't look at me like that. It's clean. What do you want for $2.60? Dirty men's clothes. Mr. Karlson called again. Your life is in jeopardy. I'll get the money. You just get the paper out. Is there any mail? In the waste paper basket. Printing bills, type writer repair bills, electric bills, phone bills, and a bill for the waste paper basket. Why is it everyone in the world wants money? So they don't have to live like this. And we owe the lady at the pet-shop, 80 cents. For what? She gave me a haircut. I would have done it for 40. I've gotta borrow your jacket tonight. Mrs. MacKaninee again? I don't understand it. What have you got that I don't have? An expendable body. I'm giving myself so your literature can live. It's not that important. I think my body should be expended once in a while. You think it's such a thrill to ride on the back of a motorcycle with a woman who has gray roots and blonde braids? You think it's a bigger thrill sitting here alone doing what I'm doing and thinking about doing what you're doing? I'm not enjoying myself. I'm doing it to save us rent money. All right, why don't you marry her. We'll get the place painted. It's 5:00, Norman. You've got a lot of work ahead of you. Promise me, when you come home, you'll wake me up and tell me everything. All right, Norman. Don't say all right. Say "I promise." I want to hear all the details. I'm emotionally starved. I'm alone a lot. I need to be fed twice a day with erotica. If you're in such bad shape, take a few hours off, go downtown, lie about your age and see an X-rated movie. I'm not a voyeur, I don't want to watch. I either want to hear or do. Then, I'll wake you up tonight and you'll hear. I'd rather do. Then do. Call up a girl you know. I don't like the girls I know. I only like the girls you know. Then call up a girl I know. They don't like me. They like you. Even the girls that I know like you. Norman, believe me, somewhere, someplace, there's a girl waiting for you. Promise me. I promise. Nice-looking girl? Terrific. Good sense of humor? Nice legs. Loves pizza and cherry cokes? That's her. I feel a lot better. I'm glad, Norman. If you take her from me, I'll kill you. You have my permission. Now I have to get dressed. Type, Norman. Let me hear typing. And I just wanted to say hi and let you know that I'm glad to meet you. Well, bye. (KNOCKING) Excuse me. My name's Amelia Cooper, but most folks call me Amy. I just moved into that bungalow across the way (CHUCKLING) Uh, I know people in big cities don't usually do this, but I promised my folks, I'd make my acquaintance with my neighbors. So, uh, I just want to say it's a real pleasure meeting you, and, uh, I hope to see you again real soon. Well, bye. Did someone just come in? Norman? Did someone just come in? (SHOUTING) Norman! What? What? No! No one came in. There's no one here. Go back inside. All right, Norman, what's the matter? There's nothing the matter. Leave me alone. Go back to your room. Can't you see, I'm busy working? At the door? I needed some air. Why don't you open the window? I don't want fresh air. I want plain air. ANDY: All right, relax, Norman. Relax. (KNOCKING) I don't hear that. I don't hear anyone at the door. I heard a knock, Norman. So you heard a knock. People knock on doors all the time. That's no reason to loiter here. (KNOCKING) Are you going to answer that or am I? I'll answer it! Stay away! Oh, hi. Excuse me again. I was just unpacking, my friends back home, gave me this fruitcake. But I don't really like fruitcake. It would be an insult to them to throw it away. So um, I would appreciate it a lot, if you would accept this with my compliments, and I hope you enjoy it. Hi! Well, it was nice seeing you again. Bye. Who's that? Her name is Amy Cooper. She just moved into the bungalow across the way. She gave me a fruitcake and hopes I enjoy it. And I love her! Wahoo! Did you see what was standing there? Did you see what moved in next-door to where I live? Wahoo! Oh, it's for me! All for me! God loves me and he gave me something wonderful! Didn't I tell you it would happen? Did you smell her? Did you waft her fragrance? Did you open your entire nose and smell that girl? No, I was in the bathroom. I didn't smell that far. (LAUGHING) Didn't smell that far... It's all over the room. In 10 minutes, it will be all over the neighborhood! Tomorrow, they'll start raising rents. And you stay away from her. No contest. She's not my type. How do you know what type she is? She was here five seconds. I only need three. She's the old outdoor girl, a lot of muscle from the neck up. Who cares what her IQ is? I'm not giving out scholarships. I just want to smell her and touch her. All right, go ring her doorbell tell her you want to smell her and touch her and then go back to work. Are you crazy? Didn't you hear the way she talked? (IN SOUTHERN ACCENT) I'm glad to make your acquaintance. She comes from Rhett Butler country. The only way to make it with a girl like that is with romance, big gestures. All right, go out and burn down Atlanta. She'll be crazy about you. You think, I wouldn't do it if I could get to nibble on her neck for 10 minutes? Talk to me. Andy, help me. I've got to plan this all very carefully. I mustn't jump into anything. One wrong move, I could blow the entire love affair. Flowers. What about flowers? Flowers every morning. Flowers twice a day. No! No! That's not big enough! How about trees? Maybe it shouldn't be big. Maybe it should be small. Something with thought, something personal. What can I do for her that's very small and very personal? How about brushing her teeth? Get out of here! You have no soul! You don't know how to treat a girl like that. ANDY: Personally, I wouldn't try. I got it. I got it. I get a can of red paint and paint outside her door. So when she comes home at night, she'll look on the ground, and it'll say, "I love you, Amy Cooper." But she's already inside. When she goes out, it's gonna say, "repooc yma ouy evol I." Why do I bother talking to you? Why do I bother listening? I don't want any distractions, Norman. You have work to do. We have a paper to get out here. We don't get out this issue, we don't get the money to pay Karlson. And if we don't pay Mr. Karlson, we don't walk, for the rest of our lives. My brains compose 3% of the human body. You want it, it's yours. I've still got 97% that needs a little affection. Now, get your nose off my nose, cause I have no intention of smelling you, when that girl lives 12 feet away. Now, move aside. Buster? Here, Buster. Come on, Buster. It's dinner time. Is there anything wrong? Oh, hi. I can't find my cat. She's just nervous. First time in a new house. Stay right there. We'll look for him together. She likes me! I can tell she likes me. It's in her eyes, her smile. You can't lie about things like that. That girl likes me! Thank you. (WHISTLING) Buster. Come on, Buster. Come on, kitty, kitty. Come to Norman. Cats like me. Most animals like me. People like me too but they have to get to know me first. In the beginning, I seem very weird. You seem very nice to me. Not weird? I haven't noticed anything weird. Well, if you do, just remember, underneath it, I'm very nice. Buster. Come on, Buster. Here, Buster. Come on, boy. (GIGGLING) Buster's a girl. (CHUCKLING) I just named her after my favorite swimmer, Buster Crabbe, you remember, he used to play Tarzan in the movies. Oh, he was a great Olympic swimmer, won three medals. I'd settle for one, next year. You're gonna swim in the Olympics? Hey, that's terrific. I'm gonna, I'm gonna teach at the YWCA during the day and train at UCLA at night. I represented the United States in the last Olympics. That's fabulous. How did you do? Oh, well, I came in fifth. Fifth is good. I love fifth. Fifth is my favorite place in a race. Well, it's not mine, especially when there are only four other countries swimming against me. I got this cramp in my leg and finished behind Egypt. I didn't know they swam in Egypt. Well, then you can imagine how I feel coming in six seconds behind some girl who was raised in the desert. That's why this year I'm going to get myself in better condition, I'm gonna watch my diet, get ten hours sleep at night, and try not to get tense, so I don't get anymore cramps. If a bird so much as twitters outside your window, he's in trouble with me. I'm sorry, I didn't even catch your name. I'm hoping someday you will. Norman. Norman Cornell. (BUSTER MEOWING) Buster? Is that you? Come on, Buster. Kitty. Oh, Buster. If you ever meet Andy, that's the fellow who lives with me, don't get too friendly. He is nice, but he irritates people. Gets 'em all tense. I wouldn't want you to get tense, a year before the Olympics. I don't see him in here. Don't go. It's such a nice place to look. (SNIFFING) Mr. Cornell, uh, I don't want to get personal, but you have your nose in my hair. I'm sorry. It just smells nice. (SNIFFING) I'm not weird. NORMAN: Please don't get the impression I'm weird. AMY: Ah, I do not think you're weird, Mr. Cornell. I just wish you'd take your nose out of my hair. NORMAN: I will. I will. You're a very attractive girl, Miss Cooper, and It's important for me to know that you know I think you're attractive. Mr. Cornell, I wish to continue looking for my cat. Just one more sniff! That's not a weird thing to ask, is it? Oh... There she is. (MEOWING) Oh, I'll get him. I'll get him. I don't want you to get tense. (YELLING) (LOUD MEOWING) Ow! Look at you! That comes off. You dip her in turpentine. Otherwise, Buster will lick it up. (MEOWING) Cats are always cleaning themselves. Oh! Ow... Let me help you. Mr. Cornell, you've helped me enough. You're a very sweet person, but I'm getting a little tense. (SOBBING) Oh, don't get tense. I didn't mean anything. I'm not weird. You don't think, I'm weird, do you? I do not think you're weird. A little strange, but not necessarily weird. Oh, don't cry, Buster. We'll get that off someday. Good day, Mr. Cornell. I'm getting to her. I really think I'm getting to her. Norman? How's it going? Norman? (TELEPHONE RINGING) Hello. Oh, Mr. Karlson. No, I couldn't call you back. I'm alone here and they haven't taken the bandages off my eyes, yet. Didn't I tell you? The doctor says my only chance is to have the operation, but it's gonna cost the same amount of money I owe you. What do you suggest I do? A cane. That's a very good suggestion. I'll get the money, Mr. Karlson. (DOOR OPENING) Get that stuff off the table! Give me room. Where have you been, all day? In love. Don't talk to me now. I'm busy. ANDY: I looked on the table, Norman. There are no new pages. I got plenty of time. Three days. Three days to complete a whole issue. I'm thinking all the time. I got everything up here. I don't want it up there! I want it down there! Don't coerce me. I can't work under coercion. How about under savage beating? I've got a life's savings and three years tied up in this newspaper, Norman, and I'm not gonna see something vital and good and worthwhile, go down the drain, because you can't think of anything but that corn-fed Minnie Mouse, next door. What's in that package? Groceries. I steal the groceries. That's for her, isn't it? You bought it for her. What's that? It's none of your business. It's private. "United Nations Gourmet Shoppe?" They always have a big sale before Lent. Miniature watermelon? Baby Siberian herring fillets? Tiny kumquats? Who's coming for dinner? A couple of midgets? I had a yen for some delicacies. Delicacies? You haven't eaten anything fancier than a banana and a peanut butter sandwich, since the day I met you. $22? You spent $22 for toy food? Take it out of my share of the profits. Your share of profits couldn't buy a banana and a peanut butter sandwich. Are you out of your mind? I'm giving her a gift. You gave your mother a gift on Mother's Day. I gave her a year's subscription to our newspaper. You hardly know this girl. I know her! I know her. I know this person. I know, she works like a dog, six days a week. I watch her coming home at night, tired, hungry. A sweet, beautiful girl coming home night after night, to nothing but canned corned beef hash. How do you know that? I check her garbage every afternoon. All right, Norman. Get a hold of yourself. Get a hold of myself? Are you kidding? My functioning days are over. I've become an animal. I've developed senses no man has ever used before. I can smell the shampoo on her hair, three blocks away. I turn my radio up full blast, I can still hear her taking off her stockings. Don't you understand? She turns me on! From my head to my toes, I take one look at her, and I light up. This month alone, my personal electric bill will be over $200! Are you telling me that we have three days to get out a newspaper, and you've spent your time buying pygmy cucumbers for a girl with strong shampoo? Don't you understand what I'm going through? Don't you know what physical attraction is? Pure unadulterated physical attraction. I do. What is it? It's when one hippopotamus likes another hippopotamus with no questions asked. Exactly. It is now 5:30, and my hippopotamus will be home any minute. Now stay out of the way. All right. All right. All right. I'll put the kumquats in the basket. You finish the article. Who are you, Myles Standish? I'll put my own kumquats in the basket. A ribbon. I need a red ribbon. Do you have a red ribbon? Do I have a red ribbon? Either you have a red ribbon or you don't? If you have a red ribbon, I'd like it for my basket, please. I'm an intelligent grown person, Norman. I'm not going to stand here and discuss red ribbons with you. In other words, you're not going to give me your red ribbon? That's right! I have 12,000 red ribbons in my closet, but I'm not gonna give you one. Get your own red ribbons. That's one I owe you, Andy. From now on, I'm keeping score. (SNIFFING) She's here. She just walked by the window. It gets better every day. You're not gonna give me your red ribbon, right? ANDY: Who do you think I am? Fannie Farmer? That's two I owe you. (TYPEWRITER CLACKING) What are you doing? Are you working? Norman, sweetheart, what are you writing? "Adomis terra amorta eternos." What is that, a prescription? It's, "I worship the ground you walk on" in Latin. Now get out of my way, or you get Elberta peaches in brandy right between the eyes. Norman, you have three minutes to deliver your care package! (TELEPHONE RINGING) United Nations Gourmet Shoppe. (RINGING DOORBELL) She's got it. She's got the basket. Mr. Karlson just called. He's sending his boys over to talk to us tomorrow. You know how they talk, with 40-pound tongues. She's reading the note. She's moving her gorgeous lips and reading the note. She's looking over here. (SLAMMING AGAINST DOOR) Here she comes! Clean the apartment! Vacuum the rug! (BLOWING) She's coming to my house! I'm shaking. Look at my hand shaking! If she loves the kumquats, if she loves the note, she's got to love me, right? Clean the apartment. Open the door! Where are you going? To open the door. Not yet. I'm not ready. I'll give it a nice intellectual touch, class it up. Okay, open the door. Open the door! Open it. Open it. Excuse me. Mr. Cornell, I've tried to be friendly, I have tried to be neighborly and I have tried to be cordial. I don't know what it is you're trying to be. If it's helpful, it's not helping. My cat is still red and slowly turning yellow. I'm tired of seeing my name linked with yours on every empty building between here and the YWCA. And as for this, I cannot accept gifts, from a man I hardly know, especially canned goods. And I read your little note. I can guess the gist of it, even though I don't speak Italian. I come home tired, hungry and nervous every night, Mr. Cornell, because I hear you sniffing through the window, as I pass your bungalow. (CRYING) I'm getting tense. I don't sleep well. And yesterday I took the wrong bus, it was heading for Mexico, before I discovered it. Now, what I'm saying, Mr. Cornell, and I don't won't to have to say it again, is please leave me alone! Don't watch me! Don't bother me! And don't sniff me! Is it all right if I call you? Oh, you are crackers, you know that? Did you know your roommate is crackers? Yes, but I didn't know the exact medical term. Didn't you listen to one solitary thing I said to you? Stop smelling me! You tell him to stop smelling me. Norman, stop smelling her. I appreciate your attention, Mr. Cornell, and I'm very flattered, but I'm also engaged to a very nice, very tall, very strong member of the UCLA swimming team. That's why I came out here. You heard that, didn't you? I wasn't listening. I'm trying to hear your hair growing. Ew. What's wrong with him? Does he have aural trouble? Oral trouble? With his ears. Hard of hearing. Yes. He has very bad aurals. You know, Mr. Cornell, if I wanted to, I could have you arrested. Did you ever hear of invasion of privacy? Look at his nostrils quivering. He's smelling me again. Do you want me to hold his nose? I'm sorry, but a girl who looks like you shouldn't be allowed to walk the streets. This is a citizen's arrest. Oh, now, please, keep away. I'm going to have my fiancee inflict him with bodily harm. Tell him that. Norman, her boyfriend is going to inflict your body with harm. Beatings, whippings, flailings... I welcome anything from her. My face is at your disposal. (STAMMERING) Wait a minute. Now... Are we on one of those television programs or something? Is anyone watching this now? ANDY: Not even me. Huh. Because if they are, they're watching a young, healthy girl having a nervous breakdown. You know, my hair's falling out. Ever since I've moved in here I brush my hair every night, then go to bed. And suddenly, there he is, sitting in that big tree outside my window strumming a ukulele and singing Spanish love songs. And I wake up in the morning with hair all over my pillow. If it keeps up, I will call the entire UCLA swim team. Tell him! Tell him. She wants me to tell you if this keeps up... I will be the happiest man in the world! She thinks of me night and day! She thinks of me. Don't you care what she thinks of you? She's engaged, Norman. Forget about her. Forget about her? Did you see what was in this room? Did you see? I saw a skinny little girl with a dodo expression. That's three, Andy. That one I'll never forget. That's not a girl. That was one of God's creations made during his best period. Don't ever call her a girl in front of me again! Well, whatever it is, if it goes bald, you've got big trouble with UCLA. I can handle all wet college kids. ANDY: Where are you going with that? You don't think I'm gonna let her clean her apartment after she's been working all day. Okay, I've had just about as much of King Kong and Fay Wray as I can take. Now, you move two steps away from that type writer, you're gonna be picking ukulele out of your head. Not unless you are capable of swallowing an entire mop! Norman, what's happening to you? I've seen you panting over a girl before, but this is the first time I ever saw you getting a bubble on your head. Don't you think I know? Don't you think I'm worried? What I'm doing now is abnormal. The behavior you're watching now is weird, Andy, weird. But I can't help myself. I'm a slave to physical attraction. And I'll do anything, including mopping her kitchen floor, to be with her every night for the rest of my life. Didn't you hear her? She's gonna marry another man! What she does during the day is her business. (DOOR CLOSING) Well? Don't get angry. Don't get mad. Can I come in for a minute? No. You didn't even hear why. Let me come in and tell you why. I won't bother you. I know you're tired. You've been swimming all day. I just want to clean up. Is that so weird? I don't think that's so weird. (GLASS SHATTERING) NORMAN: That was an accident! That lamp can be repaired. I can fix that lamp in 10 minutes. Do you know what he's doing now? Do you? He's mopping your kitchen floor. He's mopping my kitchen floor. And you don't want your kitchen floor mopped. And I don't want my kitchen floor mopped. I waxed it last night and he's mopping up all the wax. Do you hear me? I have perfect aurals. Can I use your phone? I didn't get one yet. Certainly. Hello, would you get me the Los Angeles Police Department. You wouldn't do that. You're watching me do it. Hello, I'd like to report a weird man who's run amuck in my kitchen. Amuck! Amuck! Will you listen to me for two minutes. In two minutes, he'll have my wallpaper steamed off. No, not with a knife, with a mop! I... Now will you listen to me? That's just gonna cost you another dime because I'm calling them again. Why won't you listen to me? I told you why. I already told you about my hair falling out. Now, look at this. Those big ugly red blotches are hives. Do you know what causes me to get hives? Holding a lamp to your face? Nervous tension causes me to get hives. Mopping my floor, breaking my lamp, painting my cat causes me nervous tension. I know what you're going through. I lived with that nut for three years and he's turned my hair gray. I fail to notice it. Have a look at my eyelashes. All gray. I used to have long and beautiful brown eyelashes. Did you ever see anything like that before? Gray, gray. Gray eyelashes are not as noticeable on a man as a receding hairline is on a girl. Get your hand off that phone, I'm calling again. No, you're not. You're gonna sit down and you're gonna listen. I wouldn't threaten me if I were you. You're tall and skinny and I'm short and strong. Well, I'm glad you live next door. I have a lot of trouble opening jars. May I tell you about Norman Cornell? If you can do in five seconds, because that's what you've got. One, two... He's impulsive, repulsive, incorrigible, and irrepressible. But he's also one of the most talented, creative and inspired young writers living in this country today. Will you accept that? I've never read anything of his expect that Italian mash note he left in that grocery basket. Three, four... Just hear me out. In his freshman year at Berkeley, he wrote a thesis on the economic development of the Philippine islands since 1930 without any previous knowledge of economics, the Philippines or 1930. There's no end to the talent of the mentally warped. You're times up. Give me that phone! Norman Cornell is not only one of the brightest young men in America today, he is also the hope and promise of today's generation and tomorrow's future. I just knocked the cat into the toilet. It was an accident. Help! Police! Help! Stop, will you? (CRYING) Help me, he's drowning my cat! Will you stop panicking? Easy for you to say. He's not flushing your cat into the the Pacific ocean! I promise when he comes back I'll nail him to the wall. Ow! Will you stop kicking me. I have very thin socks. Either you let me call the police or I'm gonna smash everything in this house. Starting with the dishes. Oh, you want to play rough, huh? Okay! (CLATTERING) All right, let go, let go. I don't want to take advantage of you. I'm calling the police and I don't want any trouble from you. I won't give you any trouble if you don't give me any trouble. Are you gonna let me call the police? Yes! Yes! Good. Ah! You ought to be ashamed of yourself being stronger than a fellow. Physical fitness is as important as godliness or cleanliness. What about friendliness and niceness? Just hear me out! And if you're still upset, you can go back to angriness and destructiveness, all right? Thank you. (CLEARING THROAT) Miss Cooper... May I call you Amy? No. Miss Cooper... Have you ever heard of Nitty Gritty? AMY: Is that some kind of dessert? I believe you're thinking of tutti-frutti. Nitty Gritty is the name of an underground paper put out by Norman and myself, and it is filled with protest, Miss Cooper. This is our motto. "A remedy for a sick society." We're not doctors, we're diagnosticians. We point to troubled spots. It's up to the people to cure them. I'm the editor, sales manager, and managing director. Norman writes the whole thing from cover to cover. And what we print and publish, Miss Cooper, we believe in. Now... When you go back to your freshly mopped room, I would like you to read last month's issue. And I would like you to tell me, if the things we protest against every month in the Nitty Gritty, aren't the things you protest against every day in your everyday life. Now. We have a modest business here, Miss Cooper. I will tell you frankly, to keep alive, I steal food and borrow other people's laundry, but we stay alive and get out our paper, and we'll continue doing it as long as there's an angry breath in our body and as long as there's one single iota of corruption left in this society worth protesting about. But, Miss Cooper, unless you smile at that talented lunatic with the mop out there and say, "Thank you for your little Viennese sauerbraten." One of the great organs of free press will vanish from the American scene. Is that a tear I see in your eye, Miss Cooper? That is a brand-new hive on the bridge of my nose. Then I have misjudged you. I'm delighted you're interested in the welfare of this country. So am I. You go underground, I go underwater. But I am not gonna get any gold medals or silver wedding bells unless that weird person stays out of my life. Well, there's a simple solution. You save my newspaper, I'll save your future. How? I promise to keep Norman away from you as much as possible if you will just smile at him once in a while. One hello from you could keep him happy for a whole issue. Will you do it? And you promise to keep him away from me? I'll tie a bell around his neck. You'll hear him coming from miles away. Will you shake on it? I'll nod on it. I'm not on shaking terms with you, all right. Terrific. (FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING) All finished. The cat's fine. I gave him artificial respiration. I'm sorry for what happened. That's all right. (SOFTLY) Andy, she spoke nicely to me. ANDY: I heard. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to wax my floor again. Would you say my name? Just say Norman. It's one little word, Norman. Norman. Would you say it in here? I would like to have it to keep. Norman. That was wonderful. Thank you, Amy. I've lived up to my promise. You live up to yours. I want to hear "tinkle tinkle." All right, Norman I just made that girl a promise. Now as long as you behave decently and act like a normal... What are you doing? I want the world to hear it from her own lips. Norman loves Amy! And Amy loves... AMY: Norman. Turn that off. Tell us again, Amy who is the one who drives you wild? AMY: Norman. Whisper it, Amy. Tell me and nobody else. Who do you love? AMY: Norman. (SMASHING) (PHONE RINGING) (IN JAPANESE ACCENT) Yes, please. Tamashaki Japanese Gardens. Excuse, please ANDY: Hey, Martoni, how about a little service? I mustn't think about her. I mustn't think about her, I mustn't think about her, I mustn't think about her, but I am, I am, I am. Mrs. MacKaninee, I never did this before. Can I... Can I get hurt like this? (ANDY SCREAMING) Do we have to do this much longer, Mrs. MacKaninee? I mean, isn't it... Isn't it time to go in now? I don't think I can stay up much more... Ah! Good-bye! (BIRDS CHIRPING) There hasn't been a wave in two hours, Mrs. MacKaninee. Don't you think we ought to start calling for help? Okay. There. That's what we call the breaststroke. And that's what we're gonna have to do today, okay? Everybody in the water. Whoo! Now stretch your arms way out. That's right, Mary. Keep stretching way out and kick. Excuse me. I'm looking for Miss Amy Cooper, she's a swimming instructor. Yes. Well, Amy's giving a class in the pool right now. She'll be another 40 minutes if you'll just take a seat. I don't have much time. I have to get back to work. I just wanted to give her this little gift. It will take five minutes. Where do you think you're going? It's a matter of my own life and death. WOMAN: Come back here! Where are you going? To the pool. Two minutes. I just have to see her. WOMAN: You come back here! This is the YWCA! (DUCKS QUACKING) (ALL SCREAMING) (WHISTLE BLOWING) Amy! Amy! Amy! Amy! (QUACKING) Amy! (WHISTLE BLOWING) Amy! Amy! Amy! (SCREAMING) (WHISTLE BLOWING) (SIREN BLARING) (DUCK QUACKING) (ALL SCREAMING) (SHOOING) (INDISTINCT CHATTER) Where is that pool? Come on, you guys. (BLOWING WHISTLE) All right, ladies. Which way to the pool? (ALL SCREAMING) (BLOWING WHISTLE) (SCREAMING CONTINUES) (BLOWING WHISTLE) (TYPEWRITER CLACKING) Norman? Norman... I don't want to disturb you. I'm back. (TYPING CONTINUES) I have first-degree burns on 98% of my body. The other 2% is scorched. Not a cockamamie wave for three hours. Only time I had shade was when a bird flew over me. You can see his outline on my back. Norman, I don't want to interrupt you, but could you rub a little Noxzema on my back? Oh. I can't unscrew the jar. Norman, could I... (TYPEWRITER CLACKING) (RECORDING TURNS OFF) Are you crazy? Are you insane? What are you trying to do? Take my eye out? I was trying to kill you, but I'll take whatever I can get. You're trying to blind me, I know you. Then I'll be stuck in this room for the rest of my life. That's what you'd like, isn't it? What I'd like is a bigger jar of Noxzema. I'm not gonna ask you where you were, Norman, because I think I know. I'm just curious as to why you came back? Because there's nothing left for you here except physical mutilation. I came back because I have work to do. I believe we have a newspaper to get out. Don't toy with me, Norman. My skin is like a crispy Peking duck. I am in a fragile state. I'm a writer not a doctor. Call Medicare. Who are you kidding? What about the girl? What girl? The star spangled corn pone from across the way. Where were you this morning, at the delicatessen getting a life-size statue of her in potato-salad? Oh, the new girl, I haven't given her a thought. Oh, really? Then who did I hear at that room at 3:00 in the morning playing Prisoner of Love on tissue paper and cone? That was me but that was last night. And last night is not today. Something's happened, Norman, and I'm afraid to ask what. What happened, Norman? I don't want to talk about it. You followed her this morning. You waited for her outside the Y. I did not wait for her outside the Y. You went inside the Y? I don't want to talk about her. You went inside the Y and started yelling for Amy. I did not yell. I asked politely. Then you started to yell and they asked you to leave. I don't want to talk about it. You didn't go all over the Y looking for her, did you? No, I did not go all over the Y looking for her. Where did you look? Just the swimming pool. I don't want to talk about it. They wear bathing suits if that's what you're worried about. That's what I was worried about. They threatened to call the police? No. They called the police. What'd they do? (GROANING) I'm on six months' probation. I knew it! I knew it! Do you want to hear my side? I'm not through with their side yet. We live in a police state, Andy. Did you know we are living in a police state? I know. First they start burning books, and they keep the men out of the YWCA. As they took me away in the patrol car, I heard her screaming. "I hate you, I loathe you and I despise you! "Hate, hate, hate loathe, despise, and hate!" So, I figured the best thing to do is forget about her. I think you made a wise decision, Norman. I mean, if she wants to play it cool, I don't have time to waste. You mean that? Busy. I want to get busy again. Work, work, work. Busy, busy, busy. Don't stand too close to the typewriter cause it's gonna get hot. I think you really mean it. That's wonderful. Here, Norman, type. No spaces, just lots of words. What did I see in her, Andy? She's not bright, you know. Do you think she's bright? She has a native intelligence of a very remote country. It was physical attraction and how long does that last? 40-45 minutes, the most. Say her name. Amy. Say the last part. Cooper. Now the whole thing. Amy Cooper. Say it a lot. Amy Cooper, Amy Cooper, Amy Cooper... Get out of here, you're boring me. (BOTH LAUGHING) I'm gonna sit right here and get out the mailing list. You just type. You want to eat or drink or go to the bathroom, you just sit there. I'll do everything. Norman, I love you. I truly love you. (EXCLAIMING) I'm through with her, not with girls. Leave me alone. ANDY: Don't press, Norman. You're pressing. It'll come. Have you noticed how I don't mention her name anymore? I've noticed, Norman. I've also noticed that you haven't written anything in an hour. Okay. Here I go. The paper is in. My fingers are poised. An idea is forming in my mind. Something is about to come out. Don't announce it, Norman. You're not a train conductor. You're a writer. Maybe if I just started typing, something would come out. I don't think that's gonna work, Norman. Andy. Yes? I think I'm losing my mind. Well, you're stale, sweetheart. You haven't written anything in over five days. Did you see what I just put down on this paper? Zizzivivitzz. Second in my class at Berkeley, and I wrote zizzivivitzz. You wouldn't accept work like that from a gorilla. All right, don't panic, Norman, let's not panic. Here, read it for yourself. What does that say? "Zizzivivitzz." Don't tell me not to panic. Maybe if I called her at the Y and tried to apologize. Does it make any sense to call a girl who just had the police drag you away in a patrol car? You're talking to a man who just wrote zizzivivitzz! I'll dial. You talk to her. Why should I talk to her? Because my mouth dries up when I talk to her. No words come out, just little blah blah sounds. Blah blah blah blah. If you call, Norman, you got to "blah blah" to her yourself. You know what you are, Hobart? Cold turkey. Cold turkey, lumpy stuffing and watery cranberry sauce. You have all the romance and sentiment of a sanitation truck. You're also a sexual snob. You don't get excited over a girl unless she has a straight A average. Well, I don't need you. I'll talk to Amy myself. Hello. Is this the YWCA? It is? Blah blah blah blah. Yes. Miss Amy Cooper, please. What? When? Why? Where? What? What? When? Why? What? What's happening? Yes. Thank you very much. She was just fired. They said it was the fourth time this week some nut tried to break into the pool. Third. It was only my third. Open the door, or I'll take it off the hinges! Andy, help me. I can't stand rejection, I'll never be able to write again. All right, get out of here. Let me talk to her. What will you say? What will you tell her? She's breaking the door down. I can't audition for you now. Just tell me one thing. Tell me one nice thing you're gonna say about me. You never wear brown shoes with a blue suit. Now, get out of here. NORMAN: Hi, Mrs. Fleigelman! (POUNDING ON DOOR) Where is he? Where is that lunatic? I know exactly what I'm gonna do to him. I planned it as I sat there dripping all over the bus! He's walking around out there eating his heart out. Well, tell him not to bother, cause I'm gonna get a big dog to do it for him. I've been fired. Fired. They didn't even give me time to dry off. ANDY: I know, I just spoke to the Y. Didn't you explain to them it wasn't your fault? Well, it's hard with a madman running around the hall and a duck quack-quacking in the pool. That bird is still there. He built a nest in the basketball hoop, and they have a big game tonight. Norman brought a bird? A 30-pound duck, uncooked. And don't ask me where it bit the mother of one of my little girls. I have rent due in three days and I've been fired. They said I encouraged him. I hate him! All right, calm down. I'll get you another job. Just give me a couple of days. I don't have a couple of days. I need money for rent and food. Now what am I gonna do? I'm sure there's someone in Los Angeles who needs someone who is healthy and young and strong. I don't suppose you've ever considered professional football? I've considered calling my fiancee and telling him exactly what's happened. ANDY: Wait a minute. I've got an idea. I don't say you're gonna like it, but, how would you like to come to work for us? I would rather get in a little sports car and drive off a cliff. I said I didn't think you'd like it, but it would at least pay your rent and buy your iron and steel or whatever it is you eat. I believe you're serious. Do you think that I would work for that bomb aimed at the heart of America? What bomb? This bomb. I've read it. I don't know what's in your government overthrowing mine, but do you think that I would work for a newspaper that prints articles like, er, uh, here, "Recipe: 27 Ways To Cook A Draft Card, Served For Six." Written from personal experience, Mr. Hobart? For your information, I happen to have served for two years in the United States army, where I was interpreter for Brigadier General Malcolm Halder. In what country? In this country. That idiot could hardly speak English. My feelings about this country run just as deeply as yours. But if you'll turn down the national anthem for a few minutes, you'll be able to hear what some of the people are complaining about. Well, I'm one of the people and you're one of the things I'm complaining about. Unfortunately, you're not in much of a position to complain about anything. Look, if you don't work, you don't eat, if you don't eat, you get very skinny, you fall down and then you're dead. If you think your boyfriend will be happy living with a dead, skinny lady, that's his business. Personally, I think you ought to accept the meager bread I'm offering you. (CHUCKLING) First, you take away my loaf, then you offer me meager bread. Why does everything you say sound like it came out of the Bible? Well, thank goodness you've heard of the book. Look, do you want the job or don't you? If you don't want the job, I'll take it, because I could use the money. Unfortunately, so could I. And why do you want me around here? I hate you and your friend. I don't want you around here. That weirdo does. And I'll do anything to keep this newspaper from going underwater. That was an unfortunate choice of phrase. Okay, that's your principle. My principle is breathing, eating and living like any other animal on this earth. So much for your character references. How about salary? What did you get at the Y? $85 a week. Well, Norman and I both know how to swim. I'll pay you 50. For $50, I'll come in early and poison your coffee, I want what I got at the Y, $85. So be it. You're hired. Your hours will be from 10:00 to 6:00. Half a day on Saturday. Can you type? No. Can you take shorthand? No. Can you do filing? No. Maybe you better come in at 11:00. Can you cook? My cat seems to think so. Okay, you can make lunches and pretend to look busy. You'll have two functions, first, to keep out of my way at all times, second, to smile at Norman as much as humanly possible. Yes, sir. The first I will do with the utmost dedication. The second I will do over my dead body. Miss Cooper, it's evident that you and I haven't gotten along since you came to work here. We're gonna have to try. You need money. I need that lovesick Cocker Spaniel. Now, I suggest you roll up your lips and smile so we can get to work. Okay, I'll make my bargain with the Devil, I've never run from a fight, I'm ready to go to work. Am I supposed to shake that? You're supposed to put $85 in it. We pay at the end of the week. Company policy. Then I'll start at the end of the week. I don't trust your policy. All right. Wait a minute. (COINS RATTLING) Here's your first week's salary in pennies, minus federal withholding tax and social security. (AIRPLANE ENGINE ROARING) You're doing incredibly well for a woman who only got a flying license three hours ago. I just think we made a mistake having lunch first. (SCREAMING) Oh, no! This is gonna make me sick. No, no! I am too young. Roll over! Mrs. MacKaninee! Slow down. We're gonna crash! Pull it back! Put, put the brake! Quick! Please don't put it in the bridge! No! (SCREAMING) (INDISTINCT SCREAMING) Ubiquitous, please. Under "U." Under me what? (LAUGHING) Under the letter "U." Ubiquitous. U-B-I-Q-U-I-T-O-U-S. Thank you. You're welcome. Will you stop ringing that bell. I'm not a cow. Well, you don't like it when I call you Amy. I'm an employee here. My name is Miss Cooper. What is it, Mr. Cornell? NORMAN: What's for lunch, Miss Cooper? Banana fritters, Mr. Cornell. Do you like them? I love them. What are they? Fritters made with bananas. You notice how I've calmed down since you came to work here? I don't know how I ever got along without a secretary. Oh, your apron's slipping. Let me help you with that. (DISHES RATTLING) You try that with your fingers again, you're going to have to learn to type with your nose. Your apron was slipping. Don't be angry. Don't be mad at me. I'm going back to work. See? See, I'm working again. You just keep away from me. Especially when I'm looking in the oven and got my back turned! Forgive me. For what? I love it. (SPITTING) Are you crazy? You want to give me a heart attack? Don't ever sneak up on me like that again. I didn't want to disturb you. Are you alone, or is flipper here? Shh! In the kitchen. I thought you were gonna be gone all day. I was almost gone forever. We ran out of gas and made a forced landing on a bridge. First time in history an airplane ever paid a toll. Hey, this is good, Norman. Really good. Take it inside and read it. I can't work with you in here. It's better than good. It's brilliant. You must have been inspired, Norman. Here's your lunch. Eat it while it's hot. It'll drop. Just give it time. Here it comes. Here's a fork. You want a knife? Scissors will be all right. If that's all, I'd like to go home and feed my cat. He can have mine. I'm not that hungry. I'll be back at 2:00. Could you just vacuum the rug before you leave? I can't work with an un-vacuumed rug. Where's the vacuum? In the service porch. Wait. It's heavy. I'll help. AMY: Ouch! (CRASHING) NORMAN: I'm sorry. I'm sorry. This time I'm pressing charges. ANDY: What happened? Where is he? AMY: Under the vacuum cleaner. What did you do? I bit her earlobe. It was dangling right in front of my mouth. What did you want me to do? Ignore it? Miss Cooper, Miss Cooper, wait a minute. Tell her I'm sorry. Please come back. He didn't mean it. $90. I'll raise your salary to $90 a week. She's coming back. Just square me with her this last time. I'll never ask you again. This has got to stop, Norman. She's becoming one of the highest priced secretaries in America and she can't even type. Tell her I've been working under a great strain lately. Help me, Andy. Help me. Go get a bottle of muscatel. We're gonna have a little office party when you get back. You gotta learn to relax around here. You're a good person, Andy. If I ever win the Pulitzer Prize, it's all yours. Amy, I would just like to say that I... Blah blah blah. Where's my $5 raise? You'll be drinking it in a few minutes. I knew I shouldn't have trusted you. ANDY: I thought you never run from a fight. I don't. I just had one on the service porch. My ears are pierced now, and I don't even wear earrings. I should have known you wouldn't have the guts to stick it out. Stick it out? I've been smiling at that idiot for three days. You see that? I've been doing that since Tuesday. Well, cut it out. You look like a demented ventriloquist. It was not my stupid idea, it was your stupid idea. Well, it's a smart stupid idea because it's working. It's working for you. You're getting a newspaper. I'm getting little holes in my ears. I happen to be paying through the nose for those little holes in your ears. It won't happen again. Now, I have 30 pages to edit. I'd like a little quiet, please. You won't know I'm here cause I won't be here. You'll be here because I'm paying you to be here, and he's coming back in 10 minutes and he wants you here. Then here I will be. This is not the Christian Science Reading Room, it's an office and there's work to be done. Then do it. I'm talking about you. You want me to type a letter. I can have it a year from February. You can sharpen some pencils and be quiet. Yes, boss man. (PENCIL SHARPENER WHIRRING) What are you doing? What you told me to do. Thank you. I now have a ballpoint pen without a ballpoint. You see this? I see it. Knowing your minuscule frame of reference, let me tell you that it is not a dead chicken on a stick. It is a feather duster. By that I do not mean that you dust feathers with it. You hold it at this end and you flick it against furniture. Thus dusting it. You think you can do that? Lefty or righty? If you'd like you can stick it in your pierced ear and shake your head. Just clean the room and be quiet. Yes, sir. I'm think I'm getting the hang of this now. I think I am. (HUMMING) You're not going to sing the second chorus, are you? I just work here, I do what I'm told. (HUMMING) All right. All right! Fifty addressed envelopes, 50 stamps. You got a tongue. Don't talk. Lick. Are these announcements for next week's cell meeting, comrade? No. Actually they're very thin bombs. You just add water. I get the impression that you don't approve of me as a person. If that's what you are, that's why I don't. Well, your opinions on anything have as much practical value as a 1939 calendar. I'm not paying $90 a week to listen to a limited vocabulary. Be quiet and lick the stamps. I'm a busy man. So was John Wilkes Booth the night he assassinated Lincoln. Are you implying that I was in on the Lincoln job? If the shoe fits, Mr. Hobart. Sorry, that night, I was in Philadelphia, cracking the liberty bell. I can't concentrate in front of a military tribunal. Can't face the truth, huh? Ugh. Can my tongue rest? The well has dried up. Look, if you're unhappy here, why don't you take a job as a night watchman, swimming around the Statue of Liberty, checking to see if the torch went out. "The upholders of justice "have always been the scapegoat of the enemies of freedom." You know where I read that? On the back of a Patrick Henry bubble gum card? In Speeches of Socrates. Have you read the Speeches of Socrates? I'm waiting for the paperback to come out. It's out, that's where I read it. You'd be shocked to know the amount of political literature that I have read. I would strongly doubt that you got into anything deeper than the names and addresses of the girls in the Miss America contest. And I'm sure if it was left up to a traitor like you, no one would win the Miss America contest. You're right. I think a parade of pretty girls is fine, but listening to Miss North Dakota singing an aria from The Barber of Seville in the Key of M, while baking an upside down seven-layer cake in a hoop skirt she hooped herself is beyond human endurance. You're deliberately distracting me from working on my newspaper, aren't you? Each citizen must do what he can. I'm going in the bedroom to work. All right, will you just tell me, is there anything about this country you do like? I like almost everything about this country, except people who like absolutely everything about this country. Why don't you answer my question? Why don't you question my answer? Why don't you talk like a person so I can understand which are the questions, and which are the answers? Would it be all right if I worked in your room? It would not. If there's going to be a fight, let's draw the battle lines on the field of the aggressor. And don't bother guessing who said that. I made it up myself. I had it narrowed down to you and Winston Churchill. Oh, for your information, did you know that Winston Churchill's mother was born here in the United States in Brooklyn? You'd never know it from the way he talked. Look, why don't you take the rest of the day off. Take the week off. I'm not leaving here until you admit you're snide, smug and narrow-minded. Will you settle for belligerent? I will accept deceitful and treacherous. Okay. I am deceitful and treacherous. And you are provincial, old-fashioned, antiquated, unrealistic, unimaginative, unenlightened, uninformed, and unbelievably unable to understand anything that isn't underwater. Your big trouble in life is that you were born 195 years too late. You should have been at Bunker Hill, loading muskets, raising flags, and waiting for the British to show up with the whites of their eyes. Well, you may be shocked to learn that this is the 1970s and this country has a whole new set of problems, but you wouldn't know about that because I don't think you're a real person of flesh and blood with feelings and sensitivities. I don't think you could be capable of having a genuine emotional attachment for another human being unless it was first passed by Congress, and amended to the Constitution, and painted red, white, and blue. If you have been listening carefully, Miss Cooper, I have just made a point. Okay, you want to make points? Then I'm gonna make one. I'm going to make the biggest point you ever heard. Yeah, well, when you get to it, raise your hand, will you? It's hard to tell. Oh, you'll know when I make it. Only, you're not gonna like it. Are you listening? With one ear. That's all I need with you. Then here goes. I don't like you for a whole lot of reasons, but the main reason I don't like you, is that I'm engaged to a very, very nice young man, and in a few weeks we're supposed to be married, but for some insane reason, that only a staff of Hungarian psychoanalysts could explain, and here comes the part I was telling you about, I have suddenly discovered that I'm physically attracted to you. Now, how do you like that for a point? Did you hear what I said? I heard it, I, I heard what you said. Well, how do you like them apples? Those apples. Them apples. How do you like 'em? Are you serious? Well, of course I'm serious. There is something about your physical appearance that appeals to me, and I'm as repulsed by it as you are. ANDY: You couldn't possibly be. There's no earthly reason why I should like anything about you, and I don't, but I do. Now what are we gonna do about it? If you're looking for another boost in salary, this is not the way to get it. What do you mean you're physically attracted to me? You want a complete rundown? Arms, legs, hair and teeth. Okay, get a pencil and paper. We'll take it item for item. I mean, you like the way I look? Not terribly. You like the way I walk? AMY: Not really. You like the way I dress? AMY: Not remotely. Then what do you like? I like the way you smell. Oh, Amy, Amy, Amy! And don't call me "Amy, Amy, Amy." I may be attracted to you, but I still don't like you. You're the most irritating, nauseating man I've ever met. And if you tried to kiss me right now, I wouldn't stop you. You wanna work on that for a while? No, I think I need outside help. I suppose you want to know what started it all. No, I don't. Yes, you do. Yes, I do. What started it all? It was your gray eyelashes. I've never met a man in your age bracket with gray eyelashes. And I think it's dumb to have gray eyelashes, but I'm glad you have them. Now, can I ask you a question? I'm afraid to hear what it is. Do you have any desire whatsoever to touch me? What does that mean? Which is the part you don't understand, desire or touching? I understand both parts. I just never thought about it, that's all. Well, think about it. Time's up. Do you want to touch me or don't you? You've been spiking your fritters with bourbon, haven't you? I'm being honest with my emotions because that's the only way I know how to deal with them. The plain, disgusting truth is, I would like to stand very close to you and feel your breath somewhere on my neck. You shouldn't tell me that. I know it but it just comes out. Is there any possibility of your having the same disgusting feeling for me? Well, if I did, it wouldn't be disgusting and if it was disgusting, I wouldn't have the feeling. I don't think I got that, but touche anyway. And stop following me around the room. I'm not following you. You're running from me. I'm running because you're following. Stay over there. I can't smell you from over here. What am I gonna do with you? I just gave you a suggestion. You didn't do it. Listen you, for an all-American girl with a complete set of Eagle Scout principles, how do you explain being engaged to one man and attracted to another? Very simple explanation. I can't explain it. Well, what about your fiancee? He can't explain it, either. ANDY: You mean you told him? Well, of course I told him. We're engaged. I'm afraid to hear what his reaction was. (LAUGHING) Well, you may well fear. He wants to kill you. Why me? What did I do? Well, what did I do when that lunatic and his duck chased me all over the YWCA? It's nobody's fault, it's just something that happened. Yeah, well, make it un-happen. I can't swim faster than the UCLA swimming team. I'm trying just as hard as I can to make it un-happen. The minute you do anything I find physically repulsive, we'll all be a lot better off. I liked it. We're in big trouble. What do you mean, "We're in big trouble?" I'm the one who's in big trouble. Are you just gonna yell at me or you're gonna do something about our predicament? I'm going to yell at you. You're gonna ruin everything I've worked for in my entire life. Why don't you go back in the ocean where you belong with the rest of the fish. What are you smiling about? I like it when you yell at me. Well, I don't care what you would like. What are we gonna do? Well, how should I know? But until we think of something, why don't you kiss me again? You know, you are, without a doubt, the most... Hey. I don't suppose you two have had time to chill the glasses. Fink! (CAT MEOWING) Buster? (CAT MEOWING) Buster, where are you? Buster. Come here. I want to get out of here just as badly as you do. Got you now, sonny. Mr. Karlson, I was just on my way to your shop. My shop is north and you were walking south. I have this terrible sense of direction. How's your sense of pain? Acute. Very acute. Well, we're not gonna test it yet, just gonna demonstrate what's in the future. Now, Lem weighs 230 pounds. Roy, 250. Lem is gonna show you what Roy is going to do to you if we don't get our money today. Lem? (GROANING) Now, an ordinary person would be dead from either one of them blows, but Roy is not an ordinary person. Roy is an extraordinary person. You, on the other hand, are an ordinary person. Now, at 3:00 this afternoon, we will appear in your office. If we don't have our money in our hand, Lem and Roy are gonna turn you from an ordinary person into a former ordinary person. Show him again, Lem. (GROANING) Railway express will pick up my steamer trunk in the morning. I happen to think you're making a big mistake, Norman. I've only made two mistakes in my entire life. One was trusting you as my friend and the other was going out for the muscatel. ANDY: Norman, I've known you for eight years. Can you ever remember me lying to you once in all those years? Yes. I've known you for nine years. All right. Nine years. I don't care what you saw yesterday. I'm telling you the truth. I cannot abide that girl and she finds me snide, smug and repulsive. I see. And I walked in just as she was sinking her teeth into your throat? And you were fighting off the attack with your mouth. No. She was kissing me. Kissing you? You're a foot taller than she is and you can't stand her. So, the way I see it, the only way she could have kissed you against your wishes is for her to have 19-inch lips. And I just don't buy that. I don't care what you're buying, I did not make an overt act toward her. In other words, she was the one who did the overting? Correct. Why? That's beside the point. Oh, I think not. Why did she overt you right on the mouth? You're gonna laugh. Try me. She likes the way I smell. It is now 2:30. I will be hysterical until 3:15. Oh, what's so insane about it? You like the way she smells. How can you even mention the two smells in the same breath? Norman, do you mean to tell me that after eight or nine years of a personal meaningful relationship, you would let that flag-waving sea urchin come between us? I can live with a slob, a sadist, a forger or a junkie, I draw the line at finks. What about the Nitty Gritty? You can have my half of the bankruptcy. You hypocrite, you pretended to be dedicated to an idea that we've literally starved for and you can blindly toss it all aside because we're suddenly embroiled in a romantic triangle? You, me, the girl, and the boyfriend is not a triangle. It's a quadrangle. You can't add. No wonder we never made a cent. And what do you think you're gonna do once you leave here? In exactly 30 minutes, I have an interview for a job with the AP. Working at the check-out counter? Not the A&P, you idiot. The AP, the Associated Press. Doing what? I'm a writer. They'll pay me for writing, just as I imagine you'll make your living by finking. A writer? Without me to push you and prod you and encourage you, you couldn't hold down a job writing Rhode Island license plates. No? YZ-895, and there are plenty more ideas where that one came from. All right, Norman. So we don't get along. Gilbert and Sullivan didn't speak to each other for 14 years and they wrote 23 operettas together. Gilbert never walked in and caught Sullivan kissing poor little Buttercup. All right, Norman. All right. If I have to fight for my newspaper, then I'll fight. You're joking, surely. Surely not. Andy, I'm warning you. I'm not wiry, but I'm thin. I'll slice you to ribbons. I've already faced death with our daredevil landlady pilot. I'm not afraid of a skinny typist. What's that supposed to be? What does it look like? It's a sit-in. If you don't get up from that sit-in, you're gonna see a punch down. Is that your answer to passive resistance? No. My answer to passive resistance is active kicking. Get up. What do you think you're doing? The same as they did in Bombay in 1947, when 12,000 Indians threw themselves across 15 miles of railroad track. Well, Charlie, in 30 seconds, the 3:15 is coming through. Thou shalt not pass. Thou shalt bleed from both ears. I mean, you'd hit a man who wouldn't raise his arms in defense? Actually, I prefer it that way. Norman, don't you see? If you go over to their side, it's the end of free creative thinking. They'll have you writing shipping reports and weather news. In two minutes, I'll bring in my first story, about a dead man leaning against a door. All right, Norman, I had hoped to avoid violence, but you leave me no recourse. The pain I am about to inflict is done purely on request. Do you mean it's your intention to actually come to blows? Hard hitting and everything? My first right on your deviated septum. Knowing full well that on July 15th, I finish a three-year correspondence course on Oriental combat? I intend to compensate by fighting dirty. Okay, Andy, as long as you know the score. I've been waiting six months to try this in a real-life situation. I had hoped my first victim would be a mugger, but you'll do nicely. (TAPPING) By the way, it is my legal obligation to warn you that karate may be hazardous to your health. And let me warn you that I have never once in my life struck another human being in anger. I don't want to kill you, but I have no idea how strong I am. If you feel yourself dying, just speak up. (STRAINED GRUNTING) Sooot. Sooot. Anytime you're ready. Ha! Is that the way you're gonna stand? You won't last 10 seconds. Is it your intention to weaken me first with laughter? When you're able to talk again, you can teach me the right way. Can I show you the four basic positions? I'm still gonna break your neck, but at least you'll look better. (GROWLING) This is ridiculous. (GRUNTING) You have no defense at all. I'm not even enjoying this. You want entertainment, turn on the TV. You want to fight, come and get me. I want to fight! (GRUNTING) If you're gonna do that why don't you put on those big white bloomers like the Japanese wear? You must be out of your mind. Don't you realize this is a lethal weapon? This hand is trained to kill. Once I start it in motion, it can't be stopped. It's no longer a hand. It's a mad half-crazed killer. (GROWLING) All right, I'm through toying with you. I'm going to give you one chop. Then I have to go. (BOTH SHOUTING) Damn it, Andy, why don't you stand and fight like a man? Cause I'm afraid, that's why. Isn't that what I told you before we started? Not of you, of myself. I am so seething, so fed up of your monumental stupidity and infantile behavior that if I get within two inches of you, I swear by everything I believe in this world, I'll crack your empty head wide-open! Then you better do it to me before I do it to you! All right, damn it! Here! Ow! Oh, God! My arm! My arm! (GRUNTING) (GROANING) Are you all right? Leave me alone. Why don't you watch where you're hitting? In karate you hit the neck and the kidneys, not the arm! Oh, damn! (BREATHING HEAVILY) What's the matter? You broke my Timex watch. Let me see. (SHRIEKING) It's broken! There's nothing to see. It was my good watch, too. I'm sorry. I just had it cleaned and put in a new crystal. Why didn't you take the watch off first? Because I didn't expect to get hit on the wrist. I told you you didn't know what you're doing. I don't wanna fight anymore. I'm going. For good? For good. I don't like you anymore. I swear to God, I really don't. All right, Norman, if that's the way you feel about it, I wish you the best of luck. I really loved this watch, too. So, this is the end of the Nitty Gritty. You got to admit for a while we had a good thing going here. If I knew what time it was, I'd hang around another 10 minutes and watch you cry. Oh, you don't think I'm sincere about our friendship? For this newspaper, you would sell your own mother! Coincidentally, no one has seen for three years. Norman, believe me when I say, that I would rather have a handshake from you right now than the Pulitzer Prize. What's the matter? I'm afraid you're gonna grab me and handcuff me to the railing. (SIGHING) (CHUCKING) Good-bye, Norman. Good-bye, Andy. (LOCKING HANDCUFFS) Hey! What do you think you're doing? Hey! (GIGGLING) You fink! You ratfink fink! I even have to write your lousy ideas! That one was my own, sweetheart. I heard you on the phone this morning with the AP. Now, you have one more article to complete, Norman. We're down to the finish line. Mr. Karlson's two Neanderthal sons will be here at 3:00 to pick up their $230. I can borrow the money from Mrs. MacKaninee but not unless you have the next issue ready to roll. It's up to you, Norman. Do I get my newspaper, or do the Karlsons get you? You mean, you're serious? You actually intend in real life to keep a living human being chained to a railing? Until tomorrow, when the police find an unidentified broken object dangling from a post. All right, Andy. I'm in no mood for the Prisoner of Zenda! Open up! Not unless I see some creative paperwork. Andy, I have claustrophobia! I'll go insane! Open up! Where are you going? I'm hungry. I feel like a tiny kumquat sandwich. (STRUGGLING) Help! Help! I'm being held prisoner! Mrs. Fleigelman! Mrs. Fleigelman, you want to make a dollar? Oh. (CAT MEOWING) Buster, you wait here. I'm going to make my final good-byes. 12 minutes, old boy. Ha! There have been cases of wild animals caught in traps who have chewed their paw off to escape. If I'm not out in two minutes, I'll gonna chew my paw off! Please, not when I'm eating. (EXCLAIMING) Don't you ever bother knocking? (EXHALING DEEPLY) It won't happen again, and that's for sure. Amy. Amy, thank goodness you're here. He's gone crazy! Look what he's done to me, chained me like an animal. That won't be necessary anymore. My bus leaves for Cypress Gardens in 15 minutes. I froze some fritters for you and sharpened the pencils. Since I only put in a three-day week, I believe I owe you some money. Amy, you don't have to leave because of me. I'm not gonna bother you anymore. I didn't even smell you coming in here. I'm not leaving because of you, Norman, and I don't blame you for the crazy way you've been acting lately. I understand it now. There's some things we just can't control. For no reason at all, something strange and mystified hits us, and there's nothing we can do about it except just sit and wait and hope it goes away just as fast as it came. Unfortunately, I don't see mine going away in the foreseeable future, and since there doesn't seem to be any future and I'm getting on the bus to Cypress Gardens and, um, I can't say another word, or I'll just start crying all over this floor I just cleaned this morning. Miss Cooper, wait. I am in great physical pain. You've just cracked my mouth when you opened the door, and I have a disfigured wrist from a misguided karate chop. But I just want you to know that I'm sorry. Sorry that some of us react to certain stimuli and others of us don't. However, I wish to cause you no embarrassment or hardship. Starting tomorrow, I may be running this newspaper by myself. If you like, you can stay on. At half salary. You expect me to stay here with me feeling the way I feel and you feeling the way you don't? AMY: (SIGHING) Mr. Hobart, if I wasn't afraid I'd miss my bus, I'd really tell you something. Do you have the time? I don't even have a crystal. Well, I'll tell you anyway. You're right. I may be provincial and old-fashioned. I may believe in a lot of dead things like patriotism and the Constitution because that's the dumb way I was brought up, and that's the dumb way I feel. The trouble with you is, you can't feel at all. You can't feel, you can't see, you can't hear, and, oh, boy, you can't smell! All you can do is think! But until you can learn to use all those wonderful gadgets that nature's given you, you're only one fifth of a man. And unfortunately, by the time you get them all working and realize that you're crazy in love with me, I'll be back in the Cypress Gardens high school gymnasium getting ready for next year's Olympics. And next year I'm gonna swim the United States right into a gold medal. This time I'm gonna beat the living nose plugs off that little fat girl from the desert! As for you, Mr. Hobart, I suggest you take those pennies and go get your gadgets fixed. Go visit an eye, ear, nose, and throat man. Oh, and maybe you ought to see a dentist, too. Because my former fiancee, not too happy with recent turn of events, is on his way over here to separate your teeth from your face. (CHUCKLING NERVOUSLY) That's something I wish I could stay to see, but I can't, so I'm not, so good-bye. Now you're going to get it! Now, you'll first get it. (HANDCUFFS RATTLING) Shut up, Norman. You hear what she said? The Yanks are coming. It's teeth-separation time. I'm glad I'm chained to a railing, because I wouldn't miss this for anything. I'm not gonna warn you again, Norman. You cretin-head! The girl is nuts about you, and you stand there threatening me? She's going back to Cypress Gardens, and you may never see her again. I'll see her again. When? In 1976, because I guarantee she's the next president of the United States. Norman, I've had just about enough of you. Every man has his breaking point, and my point just broke. What are you going to do? Murder. I'm going to commit cold-blooded murder (HANDCUFFS CLICKING) right here in this room. I'm gonna kill the only thing in this world that really means anything to me, my newspaper. There. Go on. You're free. Now, get out of here and let me bury the body. Maybe you were both right. Maybe I am crazy. Maybe it was insane to try and hold on to one tiny, not very important, insignificant voice in the wilderness against such overwhelming odds as a girl-smelling mental case and a wet-backed Martha Washington. I'm sure she'll be very happy now. America is safe tonight. In tribute, tomorrow Baskin-Robbins will add another flavor. She's won. Don't you see that? Divide and conquer. That's the way they do it. The war's over, Norman, and we've surrendered. In reparations, she gets the Free City of Danzig, the Polish corridor, three outfielders, two turtle doves and a lousy partridge in a lousy pear tree. Well, we can't always have what we want. You were in such a hurry to go. Then go! One thing you were right about, Andy... Physical attraction isn't enough. It's like chewing gum, it starts off great, but the flavor doesn't last. That's why they put five sticks in a pack. Before I leave, I just want to say that maybe someday, I don't know when, we'll be able to forget our differences, forget what's happened here the last few days, forget everything. And when I do, maybe someday I'll be back. I hope so, Norman. So long. So long, Andy. I forgot everything! I'm back! What took you so long? I got stuck in traffic! Are you sorry for all the nasty, mean, rotten things you said to me? Do you take it all back? Not for a second. Okay, that's good enough for me. Hey, were you really gonna give up the newspaper? Certainly, I was going to marry Mrs. MacKaninee and open the only discotheque funeral parlor in California. (LAUGHING) Norman! It's ten minutes to three. Are you going back to work? Dedicated. Never has anyone ever been so dedicated. You promise me you'll never go off the deep end over a girl like that again? No more deep ends. You won't get up from that chair until you finish. My fingers are glued to the keys! Nitty Gritty, forever! Forever, Nitty Gritty! No distractions? No distractions. No interruptions? No interruptions. No matter how much the smell in here is driving you crazy? No matter how much... What smell? What do you mean what smell? Her smell. Amy. I don't smell Amy. What, are you crazy? How can you not smell it. It's all over the room. This room? Of course, this room! She was just in here, wasn't she? I know the difference between a room smell and an Amy smell and this is definitely... What's happened to me? Want me to chain you to the railing? It's not possible. These things don't happen to me. You may have been second in your class at Berkeley, but I was first. It's just physical attraction, it won't last. It's for hippopotamuses. I know that, damn it! Then what are you screaming for? Because I'm standing here talking to you when my hippopotamus is getting on a bus! Miss Cooper! Miss Cooper! Amy... (TSKING) There's no possibility it could last. Wait till he tastes the banana fritters. Is that you, Mr. Karlson? KARLSON: It's us, sonny. (CHUCKLING) Come for your money, Mr. Karlson? Come for our money, sonny. Which you would like right now. Which we're gonna get right now. Otherwise... Show him what's otherwise, Lem. (PARTS CLATTERING) Mrs. MacKaninee. (SCREAMING) Mrs. MacKaninee! Miss Cooper! Miss Cooper! Amy! I thought you never run from a fight. I'm not running. I'm riding. You're running. Why don't you come back and fight like a man? Because I'm not a man, I'm a girl. And I'm running because you don't think that's what I am. Well, come back and fight like a man and act like a girl, or fight like a girl and act like a man. I don't care which way. Just so long as you come back. Why? You just tell me why. Because I like the way you smell! Full salary? No salary. Share and share alike. That's fine with me. You start at 8:00 and quit at 7:00. That's fine with me. I want the pencils sharpened and the papers stacked. That's fine with me. I want the books dusted, the floors mopped, and when I say hot coffee, I mean hot coffee. That's fine with me. Now, get off that bus so you and I can start ripping apart the degenerating American way of life! That's fine with me. (BUZZING) ANDY: Amy! Mr. Hobart. Mr. Hobart, where are you going? I never drove one of these before. How do you make it stop? (HORN HONKING) Mr. Hobart, wait! ANDY: Get out of the way! You're on the wrong side of the road! Amy! NORMAN: Mrs. MacKaninee, no, please. I'd rather not go out there. You go. You go, please. Check it out for me. Mrs. MacKaninee. Look at me. It's important. I'm Norman, not Andy. I love typewriters and chairs in the indoors. Outdoors, I'm basically a swimmer. I don't know how I'll ever pay you for giving me that money, Mrs. MacKaninee. There's got to be some other way. And I feel that between the two of us, we can certainly work... (SCREAMING) Help! Andy, wherever you are, help me! Your hand, Mrs. MacKaninee... Your arm. Give me your arm, Mrs. MacKaninee, please. (STUTTERS) I care for you. I have always... (GRUNTING) (SIGHING) Help! Buddy! Mrs. MacKaninee, don't sneeze. Whatever you do, don't sneeze!
