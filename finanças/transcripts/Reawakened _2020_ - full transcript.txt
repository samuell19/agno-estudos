Michele, Michele. Miss me, miss me, miss me? What do you want from me? Michele, Michele, Michele. Join me. Michele, Michele! I'm right here. Calm down. Oh, no, no, no, I don't wanna go back to sleep. No, please, no. Everything's gonna be all right. No, please. Calm down, take deep breaths. Dr. Flanagan. Good morning, Detective. How's she doing? Well, physically there's nothing wrong. However, she is still suffering from PTSD. Oh, I know all about post traumatic stress disorder, but it has been a week and she's the only one that can provide us answers. Keep it short and avoid going out of her comfort zone. - Got it. - All right. - Thanks so much. - Mm-hmm. So I'll bring in some pizza? Detective, does the doctor know you're here? Yes, Mrs. Chadwick, I have his approval. Hi, Michele. I'm sorry to bother you but I do need to get your statement. Oh, Dr. Flanagan. Don't you think it's too early for Michele to be talking about this? Well, as I mentioned to the detective, she needs to keep it short and not exceed what Michele can handle. I'm gonna record your statement now. Please state your full name and age. Michele Chadwick, 22. It's okay, just take your time. Tell me everything you remember. Where do you want me to start? Why don't you start at the beginning of the trip? Okay, well we had been talking about this camping trip for like a few weeks. And the night before, Sophia and I... Yo, this list reminds me of when we were at camp and they would tell us to bring stuff. That was my idea. That's where I got the inspiration from. Besides, I've trying to make it simple for all the guys. Oh, what do you expect, they're jocks. One of us happens to be dating one of those jocks. You know what, Travis is the exception. He's got brains, - amongst other things. - Ugh. And you're right, I really shouldn't be judging them. Yeah, especially somebody who's a psychology major. Text from Rachel. "I can't make it tonight, see you in the morning." Thanks for the short notice, Rachel. I knew she was gonna do that so I packed extra. "Okay, see you tomorrow." You know, this is you and all your animal lover stuff. Hey, animal lovers can't be animal eaters. Oh, so you're calling me animal hater? Maybe. Dude, I'm so excited for this trip. You know, hot springs, the pines, getting all of us together. Yeah, I know, and you got marshmallows. Lots and lots of marshmallows. Of course. More marshmallows. More animal-free stuff. You're stupid. Hey. Hope I got these right. Morning, sunshine. Thank you, Travis. Sorry about last night, guys. I had to close up shop. We're just glad you could make it. Did you forget something? There's more in the back. Well, I think I got everything. So, Travis, how many footballers are coming? Girl, you did not just call them footballers. You wanna mingle, you need to know the lingo. They're called soccer players. What's up, chaps? Hey, guys. Okay, guys, quick intro for Rachel. This is Nate, he's in two of my classes. Yep, that's me. Enchant√©. Okay and this is Brandon and Jessica. Brandon's also on the team and Jessica-- Is his girlfriend. Ah. Definitely see you guys are a couple. Good, so then there shouldn't be any misunderstandings. No, no misunderstanding here, sweetie. So, what is this place we're going to? Beckon Falls. I actually was on SNL for like a minute. Who? Who was? 14 miles? Hey, you can do it. Of course, I'll be fine. I don't like the way that blonde bitch looks at you. Yeah, well, be nice Jess, all right? - Sorry. - It's okay. How you holding up? Between Pilates and Cardio Barre, I can walk all day. You all right? Why does everyone think I can't walk this far? Okay, sensitive. You don't do that much hiking, do you? It shows? Well, for one, the pack is too heavy. I thought it seemed a little bit big but I just brought whatever Sophia told me to bring. Uh huh. Here, let's trade. I think I can handle yours better than you can. - You sure? - It's okay. Yours is so much lighter than mine. Last time I went fishing and hiking and camping, I was in the Boy Scouts. So you were? Yeah, since I was 10. Cute. All right, the directions point to the right. But that doesn't make any sense. Like, that road looks like its going back down - the way we came. - Just give me the directions. That's weird, I can't get a signal. Oh, I forgot to mention, there's no cell service out here. Even I knew that. The lake is supposed to be at a higher elevation. That road leads down. Look, on the soccer field, you might be team captain but this is my turf and I don't need some stupid map, it's obvious. Hey, chill out, dude! This isn't a competition. I know what I'm doing! If Sophia's cousin says to go right, we're going right! Okay, easy boys. Come on, what Brandon says makes sense. Okay, let's just follow the directions and if we don't start heading upwards, we'll turn back around. Okay? All right. You heard the boss. Let's go. Nate, are you sure you don't mind carrying my stuff? Yo, I got it. All right, you're a lifesaver. Hey, no problem. Hey, I see you brought a mini rod. Yeah, of course. She told me there's a great fishing spot. What? Oh, that's cool. I always thought there was something different about you. Maybe you could show me how to catch a few? Yeah, for sure. All right, guys, let's take a break. Finally. I'm sure it'll start going up hill again soon. How far do you think we've come? Should be about halfway. Hey. I'm sorry. For what? For being short with you earlier. You're a tough little cookie. I know you can handle it. Guys? I see some anger in the clouds. It's not looking good. Yeah, we should probably start pulling out our rain gear. Hey, look over there. Is that a building? Yeah, that's a house all right. Looks abandoned though. Let's check it out. Come on. What's this place doing here? All right, move. I'm going in. Are you nuts? Well, all right. Yep. Well, there's no electricity. It's all right, we'll survive. Yeah we will. Why do you guys think it's abandoned? Who cares, it's ours now. You say something? I didn't say anything. How convenient. Woo! Guys, guys, guys. A little elbow grease and this place will be good as new. There you are. What the hell is that? What? That voodoo stuff. Weird. You okay? Yeah. What you got there? What you got? I found it. - Well does it open? - No. Okay, cool. Finders keepers. Do you hear that? Hear what? Never mind. Okay, well we're going to start dinner. Okay, I'll be right there. Okay. Hey, did you find her? Oh yeah, she's coming. Let's just go get dinner started. I will choke that blonde bitch. Oh, I love it when you get angry. I know you do. Hey! We gotta go get dinner started. Sorry, there's just something about a mountain man, you know? Okay. Come on. We will finish this later. Oh, we better. No, we won't. I'm just gonna go help Travis out, all right? Nothing like a bunch of busy beavers. You did not just call us beavers. I don't think she meant anything by that. Figure of speech. Oh, I guess I just expected more from a college girl. Okay, you know, the beaver's one of the most diligent and hardworking animals on the planet. Right, Jess? Yeah, that's what I meant. Now give me something to do. Here. Do something with those. Hey. You were right about the road. We should've taken the other one. We cool? Yeah, cool. We should head back the other way tomorrow. You got it. Who's thirsty? Yeah! My dude. Hey, Brandon, where'd you score that bottle? Courtesy of my pops. My dog. All right. Yeah, yeah. Oh, can you handle this? Try me. Say when. When! When! Are you trying to get me drunk? Uh. Mmmm. Have a good time over there with Goldilocks? What? I saw you completely undressing her with your eyes. I was just pouring some rum. Mm-hmm. Besides, the only one I'm undressing with my eyes - is you. - Uh huh. Hmmm? Hmmm? Shut up. - Hey. - Hi. Hey, so, you have a thing for Brandon? What? No way. I just like pushing Jessica's buttons. Oh. Okay. To pushing buttons. To new friends. Yeah. Yeah. New friends. So do you still have any energy leftover? Oh, I think I am wide awake. Oh, let me see what you got. Oh. Yo, that food was on point tonight. Thank you. Teamwork. Is she doing that for our benefit? Probably. That's so Jess. Hey, how about some ghost stories or something? Oh, I love scary stories. Do you know any? No, no, no, no, I get scared too easily. Listen to my music, thank you very much. Fucking wuss. Well I know one. All right, well let me know when you done. Okay, go on, go on. Just stop keeping us in suspense. All right. There once was this very sexy girl. Okay, why does she have to be sexy? I mean, can't she be intelligent or plain? Who's telling the story, you or me? Okay, go on, tell your story. Okay. So, this intelligent and kind of plain-looking girl, Nina, starting partying way too much. All right, you made your point. Just tell you story how you want it. All right. This hot chick named Nina started partying way too much. Her grades were slipping, so her parents grounded her. Now, if her grades improved, they have her a second chance but with an early curfew. Now, as you can guess, on her first night out, Nina was having such a good time that she didn't make it back on time. And when she finally did get home, she found all the lights out. She tried the front door, wasn't locked. So instead of just going on inside, she went around back and climbed the old oak tree beneath her bedroom window, as she had done so many times before. Next morning, Nina wakes up early. It was quiet, so she thought maybe her folks went into town without waking her. When she reaches the bottom of the stairs, she sees blood everywhere. She runs in the living room to find her parents' mangled bodies. She screams when she sees written on the walls in their blood the words, "Lucky you didn't open the door." Asshole, you trying to give me a heart attack? Look, I'm sorry, I heard this story before and I thought it would be funny. Yeah, that's your problem, you don't think. At least, not with your head. Whoa. Coming back to bed? Mmmm, in a minute. Goodnight, everyone. - Night. - Goodnight, guys. See y'all. Well, goodnight. Night. Night, guys. Night, y'all. Hey, it's okay if you guys want the other bedroom. Oh, it's all right, we can just stay with you. One big slumber party. There's my personal heater. This is her weapon. Why do you hurt these poor children of Christ? What harm have they done unto you? I do no hurt them. Abigail Barker, you are charged with sundry acts of witchcraft, committed unto the bodies of Mercy Lewis, Ann Putnam and others. I'm innocent, I know nothing of it. I have done no witchcraft. You are charged with tempting them to sign the Devil's book. It's that said book. Tis false, I tell thee! I've done no wrong! She bears the mark of Satan himself! It's over her heart! There is no denying. Who do you serve? I serve no one. Then you serve not our Lord. What contract have you signed with Satan? You put words in my mouth. I have made no contract, I never saw him in my life. Anne Putnam saith that the devil is her god, not I. Have you not in your heart to tell the truth? I do tell the truth. I never hurt these persons. I am no witch! Have you not given consent that some evil spirit should do this in your likeness? No. I am innocent! All accusations against me are false! Abigail Barker, I find you guilty of being a witch! And I here order to proceed with your execution! You are a liar! I am no more a witch than you are a wizard. Take her away! You will pay for this! What's wrong? Whoa. Hey, it was just a little quake. Is she okay? - Come here, sweetheart. - A little shaken up. Sweetheart, it was just a little earthquake. Let's go. Hey, is she okay? Oh my God. And that's when I noticed that her eyes had changed. Did anyone else notice the change taking place? I don't know. It's okay, just take your time. I don't know. I can't remember. - Honey, what is it? - What? What? She's right there! - She's right there, Grandma! - There's no one here! No, no, she's right there! No, she's right there! - Who did you see? - Sophia's right there! She's right there! She's right there! She's right there! We don't see anything. Yes, there's, Grandma, please save me, Grandma! You've had enough excitement. Grandma, Grandma-- This has got to stop right now. Please, Grandma, no! I'm gonna give you something to relax. No, no, I don't wanna go back to sleep, please! Doctor, please, it is very pressing that we finish her statement! I understand but right now I can not allow you to continue! All right, I'll pick this up later. Mrs. Chadwick-- Do you realize how difficult this is for all of us? I understand that and I respect it but its very difficult for the other parents involved as well. I'll check back later. Damn it. Michele? Detective. Yeah. Where's my grandma? She left. So, how you feeling? Better. I don't wanna sleep anymore. You know, there's a lot of people that wanna hear your side of the story. I know, it's just hard. I'm not trying to keep anything from you. That's good. I just want to find out what happened to your friends. You ready to continue our talk? - Okay. - All right. So, what happened next? Well, we were sleeping and then, in the morning... You guys, there's no sign of her out there. Guys, I found her hair with blood all over it. You think somebody kidnapped her? Why would they only take her? I don't know but we've searched this whole house. Guys, I'm really scared. Come on, guys, this is Sophia we're talking about. She had to leave on her own accord. But why didn't she tell anyone? And where did all that blood come from? That time of the month? Don't mess around. Okay, guys, listen up. We're all gonna split into groups and we'll search for her in different directions. It's the fastest way to find her. I'll head back down the trail. I'll go with Brandon. Good, then Michele and I can search the trail to the east and maybe Nate and Rachel can search to the west. If we can't get any signal, how are we supposed to get in touch with each other? When you guys do find her, just have one person stay with her and the other person head back. And no matter what, we're all gonna meet right back here in one hour, all right? One hour. Let's go. Let's go. Sophia! Sophia! Sophia! Sophia! Sophia! Sophia! Sophia! Sophia? Where you at? Sophia! There's no sight of her. I don't get it, she's disappeared without a trace. I don't understand where she could have gone. Let's keep looking for her. Hey, aren't we at the crossroads? Yeah. Sophia! Do you feel that? Feel what? It feels like someone's watching us. No, you're imagining things. Did you hear that? Yeah. I think it came from over here. Come on. Shit! Brandon! Ugh. Well I didn't expect that. Are you okay? I'm okay. Christ. I got you. Is that Sophia? Yeah, I think so. - Sophia! - Sophia! Oh my God. Did she dig this with her hands? Sophia? Sophia, what's come over you? Sophia. Yo, it's me. Nate. Yo, her hands are like ice. Stop that! Stop that, what is wrong with you? Sweetie, please just relax. It's okay, just get some sleep. Is she breathing? Is she breathing? - What's wrong with her? - I don't know, I don't know. We need to get the hell out of her. How is she? I don't know. There's something wrong with her, okay? She's acting very strange. Yeah, she's lost her mind. We caught her digging a whole with her bare hands. Brandon, don't say that. I mean, she's probably delusional from the flu or something. First she finds a necklace, then her eyes turn all weird. Now she digs this book out of a hole. I mean, she's gotta be a little crazy. I can't even read a word in this book. It's English. I know that, you bimbo. Fuck you, bitch. Hey, guys chill out. I meant, it's old English. And I still can't read it. Just give it here. This looks like some kinda Shakespearean writing stuff or something. Looks like spells. You guys, it does not matter what it says in that book. Right now, it's Sophia's condition we should be worried about. We need to take her to the hospital. No. It wouldn't be safe to try and make it down now. Just give her the night to rest and we can head out first thing tomorrow morning. I'm with you, bro, especially with all this drama going on. You know, Brandon, you've always had a way with your words. You're an asshole! There you are. I've been worried. Just couldn't sleep thinking about her. Hey. Come back to bed, okay? Huh? Come on. Let me finish this. Okay. You think Sophia's losing her mind? Something is wrong with her. Hey. Don't keep me waiting too long, all right? I won't. Brandon? Who's there? Is that you, Blondie? If you're trying to scare me, it's not working! Where you going? Come back here, you bitch! Michele, what're you doing in here? I heard footsteps. I didn't mean to startle you. I just came back from my recorder. No, I'm glad that you did because I don't wanna keep this in anymore. I wanna tell you everything. All right, come on, let's go. Just start from the beginning and tell me everything you wanna tell me, all right? Michele, Michele, calm down, what's wrong? - What happened? - She came back! She came back! - No, it's okay, calm down. - Sophia came back! Detective, what have you done now? Nothing, I came in and she as in the closet and started screaming. - Let's get you back in bed. - Michele. I need assistance and page Dr. Flanagan! Detective, you need to go! Calm down. I'll be back, Michele. I'll be back. Jessica? Jessica? Brandon, what's going on? It's Jessica, she never came back to bed last night. She's gotta be around here somewhere. No, look, I checked! Yo, guys, what's up, man? Jessica's missing. - You've gotta be kidding me. - What? Sophia's gone too. Ah! What the hell's going on? We're fucking cursed! All right, everybody, guys, just calm down. Let's just think this through. All right, look, you can stay if you want, I'm not coming back here without Jessica! - Brandon! - Dude! Guy, guys, let's just split up and look for her again, okay? Split up? Dude! Jessica! Jessica! Jessica! Sophia! Jessica! Jessica! Jessica! Where are you? Come out! Sophia! Jessica! Nowhere. Jess. Jessica! Sophia! Whoa, do you feel that? No. There's something here. Oh, hell no. Don't even go there. Right now we just need to find Jessica and Sophia. Come on. Jessica? Sophia? You're not Sophia. Who are you? Abigail Barker. Don't come any closer, all right? I mean it! What'd you do to Jessica? She made a good sacrifice. Did you hear that? Shit, Brandon! Sounds like it came from over there. - Nate, cut him down. - Brandon. Oh my God! We found him hanging. Who could have done this? Brandon was the toughest guy we knew. I don't know, man! There's gotta be more than one killer. You guys, what're we gonna do? We can't leave him here. Let's just take him back to the house. This is so unreal. Any ideas? No. Let's just get the hell out of here. I don't know about you but I really wanna get out of here. I just can't believe this is happening. Nobody goes anywhere without somebody with them. I wanna get out of here now. I'm with Rachel on getting the hell out of here! We will as soon as it's safe. We'd never make it back before nightfall. Yeah, Travis is right. We really should all stay together. There's strength in numbers. Guys? Guys? Hey, did one of you leave the backdoor open? No, not me. I didn't do it. Yeah, I wasn't in the kitchen. Well who did? There. Let's go make sure the rest of this house is secured. Yeah, that's a good idea. Windows closed. Travis, I'm so scared. Hey, I'm here for you, babe. I won't let anything happen to you. Oh, hey! How y'all doin'? Bedroom is secure. What does that mean, that the house is safe now? As much as we can make it. I wish there was something we could do about Sophia and Jessica. We need to get help. Have a real search party out here looking for them. I hope they're okay. We just need to stay safe tonight. I wonder what's in this book. I just wanna know why the hell she dug it up in the first place. There's like spells and chants. I found one for protection. Yo, close that book, it's creeping me out. Wait till I get back so that we can actually-- Where you going? To get warmer sweats. I'll keep you warm. Yeah. That's exactly what I was afraid of. What, no, I'm being serious. The group said we have to stick together. Yeah. I'm gonna go get those, I'll be right back. Wait, you guys, listen to this. "Thrice around the circle bound, "all evil sinks into the ground. "By light of day and darkness night, "I am protected by thee might. "Goddess of the moon and stars, "I call to thee which tis me right, "protect me from all evil's might. "Protected me from all evil's harm. "Protect me from all evil's might. "Protect me from all evil's harm." Hey! You all right? Yeah. Sounds like a weird nursery rhyme. Why don't you put that away and come here? I wouldn't be reading those if I were you. You don't know what they are. Rachel? Rachel? Hey guys, come here. Michele, Michele. You're all right, you're all right. Nate, watch my back. Gotcha. Shit! Where the hell did she go? I don't know. We have to leave now. Shit! I so fucking hate her. Get her out of here! - Ow! - Are you okay? Are you okay? Yeah, I'm okay, I'm okay. Just put a little pressure on it so you know you can walk. - All right, I got it. - Ready? Yeah, let's go. Come on. - Nate! Nate! - What? What? I can't run anymore. - I can't run anymore. - What happened? My knee. Okay, let's just get off the trail and find cover, okay? Okay. Nate, Nate, seriously, I can't go on. Okay, then let's just relax, okay? I don't know what the hell that was but that was not Sophia. Look, she looks like she's possessed. I don't know what's wrong with her! Crap, look, we just need to get out of here as quick as possible, period. Go! Go! Go! Go! Protected me from all evil's might. Protect me from all evil's harm. Protect me from all evil's might. Protect me from all evil's harm. She's gone. Yeah, I don't see her. Nate, my knee hurts so bad. You should just go. No, I'm not leaving you here. We stay here for the night and leave at daylight. You're strong, I know you. Michele, we gotta move. I know. My knee's feeling just a little bit better. It still hurts? Yeah. Try this. Okay. I think this will work. - It'll work? - Yeah. Nate. What are we gonna tell their moms? Travis' mom. All right, look, let's not concentrate on that right now. Let's just concentrate on getting out of here. Sorry. Hey, it's all right. Be strong. Take it one step at a time, okay? There you go. We're almost there. - All right? - Yeah. We made it. Please tell me you have the keys. Yeah, I do. You stay here, okay? No, no, no. No, Nate, no. No, no, no. Sophia! Sophia, why? I'm Abigail. Sophia, it's me, Michele! Blood must be shed. But they're our friends, Sophia. They were useless to me. You stay away from me. You stay away! That doesn't work. Ow! Sophia, listen to me! Let me help you! Michele, oh my God, help me. Please help me. Sophia, what can I do? Give me my book! And if I don't? You don't know what you're doing. You think you can negotiate? One sure thing, the book is mine! Abigail, let Sophia go! Too late now! She is gone! You crazy bitch! No! Hey! Leave her alone! Hey! Hey, you! And I don't remember anything after that. Well, Michele, I think that clears it up. The hunter corroborated your story, however, we have yet to confirm the perpetrator's identity. Detective, it's Sophia! Abigail possessed her, why can't you believe me? Calm down, calm down. You need to get some rest, all right? I'll have a transcript made of this recording and we'll go from there, all right? I promise. Did you guys find Jessica? We did. Is she? I'm afraid so. Michele? Time for your meds. Good afternoon, Detective Henderson. Judy. Are you done? Actually, we're done. Take care, Michele, I'll be in touch soon, all right? We'll talk. Detective, you're not gonna find Sophia. Not unless she wants you to. I'll be in touch. Detective Henderson. Howard, how are you? Fascinating person, this Abigail Barker. She was a real person then? Oh yeah, absolutely. She was born in 1670. What else can you tell me? Well, this Abigail Barker was put on trial in 1692 and she was found guilty of practicing acts of witchcraft by the local magistrate. She was then tortured, which was standard practice at the time, and then eventually executed. Really? Okay, wait a minute. How easy would it be for my witness to have access to that information? Well, anyone can research it, but I suppose "why" would be my question and then, how would they even find this book in the first place? Which, by the way, happens to be a compellation of spells and incantations. To tell you the truth, I as hoping you were gonna tell me that Abigail Barker was just a bunch of folklore and that book a bunch of nonsense. Now I can get back to work and get that book carbonated. What else do you got for me? Well, I don't know if it's relevant at all but I also found some documentation of accusations against witches using amulets to transform themselves into animals and even powerful creatures, supposedly. You've gotta be kidding me. No, it was actually documented multiple times during the witch trials. Well, that's about all I have for now but keep me posted on what happens, okay? Most definitely, thank you. All right. Goodbye. Howard. Who is that? You know who this is. No, I don't know you. Oh, but you do. It's Abigail. No. That's not possible. Aren't you a believer? Take a seat, Professor. I said, sit down! I don't understand. You're no different than they were. It seems the professor has been telling tall tales to Detective Henderson. People love tall tales, wouldn't you say? I suppose. When I was younger I used art and spells to connect with nature. I only meant good back then. The folks people lied and labeled me a witch! They did unspeakable things to me! And I now you know the rest! But they couldn't destroy me. Because I choose darkness. My ally. We have just been waiting to find someone to give me my vessel. The book of spells. Ah, you're a smart man, Professor. So I'm sure you understand that until I find my book, I only need a little blood sacrifice here and there. Professor, let's see what dead flesh feels like. Sleepy time. So Dr. Flanagan said that I could go home in a day or two. Don't you think it's a bit too soon? Why do you say that, Grandma? You're still having episodes. The neighbors are talking, huh? You know I don't care about that. So then why do you have a problem with me coming home? I don't. How's Travis' mom doing? Well, as well as can be expected, you know. They all blame me, huh? Honey, until this thing gets all sorted out, people are gonna talk, they're gonna come to their own conclusions. Yeah, well I'm a victim in this too, Grandma! I know you are, sweetheart. You know, Sophia's parents have put up a reward for her safe return. She's not coming home! She's dead! I mean, how many times do I have to keep telling people this? Sophia is not Sophia anymore! Sophia killed Travis, she killed all of my friends, Grandma! Oh, honey. That's why I don't want you to be in such a hurry to come home. Grandma, I don't wanna stay in this fucking hospital anymore! It's like a fucking prison in here! I miss all of my friends' funerals. Lieutenant. What's up? Hey, Nikki. Detective. Looks like Miles had a chance to call 911 before he died, so approximate time of death, 9:10 PM. He's got a single knife wound to the chest, was also stabbed in the hands. There's some claw marks in the back of his neck. God. How did they get in? No sign of a break-in. We had to pick the front lock to gain access. Locked from the inside. What's this? He wrote a name with his blood. Don't touch anything. Forensics is on the way. Okay, that's odd because Miles was doing some research for me on an Abigail Barker. So we have a suspect? Not exactly, the Abigail Barker we're talking about died in 1692. I guess that was too easy. Hey, what about that 911 call? He only asked for an ambulance. The line went solid after that. Okay, I'm gonna wanna get a copy of that call. I'll get you a copy and put it in the folder. Hey, how's that Chadwick case coming? Slowly, we're dealing with a very fragile victim. Victim? Thought she was a suspect. Another girl went missing and right now she's the only survivor. Well, physically, you're in excellent shape. Any pain? Nope. How about the nightmares? Oh yeah, those haven't come around in awhile. Ready to go home? Sure. Well I'm gonna change your medication a little bit and if you have another day without any incidents, you can go home. Sounds good to me. Lower her dosage to 25 milligrams and let's keep an eye on her. What about her nighttime pills? Just give me a call in the afternoon and we'll make a decision then. Dr. Flanagan, am I gonna have to take these pills once I go home? Well, with this medication, you can't quit cold turkey. We have to decreased your dosage gradually. I want you to contact your family physician in the next two days. We'll send you home with some instructions and my notes to your doctor. Okay, because I'm ready to go. Yeah, I bet you are. What do you got for me? I got nothing. I've dusted head to toe several times. I can't even find a partial print. What about these claw marks, here? Any idea where they would have come from? They appear to have been made by talons. However, that's not what killed him. He died from a single knife wound to the chest. What about under the fingernails? Clean. Whatever it was, the poor guy didn't have a chance. Hey there. Hi, Beth, I'm ready to go home now. I bet. I should hopefully have your paperwork done within an hour. You done with this? Oh yeah, thank you. Let me know if there's anything else you need in the meantime. I will. What are you doing? Stop! Stop! It'll feel good. Somebody help me! Help! Help me! Don't bother screaming, no one can hear you talking. It's so good to be home. Come here. Everything's gonna be fine now that you're back. Thank you, Grandma. You're always so optimistic. Why don't we order some pizza? Sounds great. Okay. Excuse me, can I help you? Where is she? Excuse me? That whore! You need to leave right now. I don't think you heard me. I said, where is that bitch of a whore? You need to leave! Where? Where is she? She's gone home. Goodbye. What's going on here? Too late, Doctor. What the hell are you? Shoulda heeded my warning. Hey, there's one more slice. Oh no, I'm too full. Oh, okay, you want more? Sure. Okay. I'll get it. Detective. Mrs. Chadwick. What can I do for you? Is Michele home? Yes. What's going on? May I come in, I need to speak with you both. Sure. Wait here. Honey, it's the detective. Michele, I'm gonna get right to the point. There's been a tragedy at he hospital. What happened? This afternoon, Dr. Flanagan, his main nurse and a security guard were killed. Oh my God. It's Abigail! Strangely enough, several witnesses have confirmed that the perpetrator's identity does fit the description of Sophia, with the exception of her eyes. No, it's Abigail, I told you, she's coming! I've got two officers guarding your house and in the morning they will take you down to the station to sign your statement. It was Abigail, I told you she's coming. So you do think we're in danger. I'm not taking any chances. I've got two officers guarding the perimeter of your home and I'm not leaving until I know it's secured. Mmmm. Want me to fix you something before you leave? Oh no, I'm just gonna get some coffee. Okay. Oh, Grandma, they're here. So I'll see you later. Good luck, baby. Call me if you're gonna be late. Okay. Your ride is here. Are you all right, miss? Yeah. Just a little chest pain. Okay, ready to go? Yeah, let's do this. We've got another room down here we can check out. Yeah, let's use this room. There you are, I've been looking all over for you. What's up? Stevenson found something. What does he have? Not sure but it sounded extremely important. I was just about to have Michele repeat her statement. I'll get it started for you. You sure? Yeah, I've got some time. Michele, this is Lieutenant Paxton, he's going to review your statement with you. When you read it, make sure you look over everything, okay? Okay. All right, I'll be right back. Hey, young lady, shall we? Have a seat. Here you go. Whoa. Yeah, Henderson can be pretty thorough. Looks like you got a lot of reading to do. You need something to drink? No, thank you. Okay, go ahead and make any corrections you need and I will be right back. I have something you'll wanna see. Take a look. What is it? It's the tip of the blade. Is it gold? No. It's either a bronze or a copper blend. Really? I'll send it to a metallist to confirm. Any idea? It's very old. I don't have the equipment to date it properly. How are you doing? I just finished. Anything you'd like to change? No, everything seems about right. So this is not an interrogation. Just a couple things I'd like to confirm. Is this the knife you said Brandon had in his possession? Yes. What about this book? Yeah, that's the book. Okay. I just wanted to make sure everything-- If you ask me... I have no respect for authority. Sophia, come on, it's me! I'm Michele, I'm your friend! Oh please, come on. Come on. Sophia is dead. I couldn't have killed you. You were protected. The book is mine. Hey! Stop! Oh my God! I need am ambulance now! Michele. Oh my God. Michele. Michele, you're all right. Sophia. What? Sophia. You should just save your strength. I need help in here, now! Can I get a ride? Sure. What's your name? Abigail.
