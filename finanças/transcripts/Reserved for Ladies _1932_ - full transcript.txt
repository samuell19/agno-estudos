But I haven't noticed the color of her eyes yet. Oh, what do you have? I speak of la salle, the dining room, and you? - Aha, it is the woman, eh? - It is a girl. And when will you look and see the color of her eyes, eh? - Tonight. - She come? - Yes, she come. - Oh, it is nothing. You meet her outside. She come here tonight. You see the color of her eyes, she see your uniform and... voil? tout est fini. How you say... It is all off. She's marvelous, marvelous. Oh, confound it all. I'm afraid I'm in love with the girl. Ah, you see? No clearness of mind. Ah, you English! If you were Latin, you would say, "I love that girl." I would like to marry her, but as I cannot there is only one thing that I can do, yes? Yes, I know. I know all about that Latin stuff. There you are. I leave that to the Latins. Mon Dieu, ces anglais! - Number 21 wants you, sir. - All right. - Madame? - Oh, Max. I don't know what to have, Max. What shall I have? Might I suggest the tournedos Bordelaise... pomme souffl?e? No, no... let me order for you, Madam, a tournedos Grand-Duc Watteville... ...flamb? au fine champagne. Oh, Max, that would be marvelous. Thank you, Max. Thank you, Madame. And all you can think of is steak. Marco... - Steak. - Yes, sir. - Call Max for me. - Yes, milady. Max, is that all right or not? It's perfect, milady. Are you sure it's really well done? - Absolutely, milady. - Not over done? - No, milady. - And not too hot? - No, milady. - All right, then. - Thank you, Max. - At your service, milady. Max, can you guess what I'm feeling like? May I hope, in the interest of the establishment, Countess, hungry. But what for, that's the point. Oh, no, don't pay any attention to them. They don't appreciate you like I do. - Now, what's it to be? - Might I suggest a little, er... - ...caviar with vodka to begin with? - Yes, that'll do. - And then? - And then, er... - Some soup? - You know my taste. Something hot. Er... and um... - After the soup, might I suggest... - Oh, Max, your too consciencious. You know I'd be perfectly satisfied if you'd give me... ...what we had uh... Was it last night? Thursday, Countess. - Was it Thursday? - Yes, Thursday. Well, of course you'd know. - Wouldn't they, Max? - Yes. Well, that's fine. Go ahead. At your service, Countess. - Who's she? - Countess Ricardi, Your Grace. - Countess? - Her present husband is a count. - He's her second? - Her fifth. - The one on her left? - No, that is Mr. Vanderloo, Your Grace. - Who's Mr. Vanderloo? - The financier. - The financier. - Yes, Your Grace, the financier. And who has she got for a lover? Oh, er... I really don't know, Your Grace. But Max, you should know. Find out. - And tell me the next time I see you. - At your service, Your Grace. You will see the color of her eyes... ...she see your uniform and voil?, tout est fini. How you say, it is all off. Yes, sir, here, sir. Very good. Railroad tickets for Miss Robertson, sir. Table 24. The tickets are here, Daddy. Both of them. Well, why do you not go and find out the color of her eyes? You are afraid, my friend, uh? Listen, tell Marco to take charge of the restaurant. I'm leaving now. I'm going abroad. Are you crazy? Where are you going? I'm going to find out the color of her eyes. - Carry, madame? - No, nothing at all. Oh, dear! My bag. You pop up everywhere. - You drop things everywhere. - I know, I'm an awful girl. Come on, daughter. Say, who was that young man at the customs? Parsifal? I have no idea? Yes, but you know his name. Parsifal? Oh, that's a nickname I gave him. It means the pure fool. What on earth are you talking about, a poor fool? Pure, dear, not poor. Parsifal, the pure in folly. It's all out of an opera. Of course you wouldn't understand about that. Anyway, I mean to have some fun with him. You mean to tell me you've arranged to meet him again? - No. - Well, perhaps you'll never see him again. - He'll be along in a minute. - How do you know? I don't know, but I'll bet you he will. Well, I don't bet. And I bet you his compartment is in this very car. Well, I hope he won't be such a darned, infernal, brainless fool. - You'll see. - Hm. What fools men are. - Are they really, Daddy. - Ahh... Now, Daddy. Just a tiny little bet that he'll want to have the seat at our table. If I win, I'll do just as I like for 24 hours. And you won't say a word. Yes, and if I win, you'll do just as I like for a week. Oh, you're a Shylock. So, it's a bet? Lord! Daddy. You win. Oh, monsieur. Quel plaisir de vous voir ici. How happy I am to see you. Ah... bon jour, mon vieux. ?a va? - Very well, thank you. - Bon, bon. I hope you will be content here. Of course it is not your palace... ...but we'll do our best. I will see the chef myself and I hope you will be pleased. J'en suis s?re. Merci, merci. - Russian. - Armenian. Maybe Bulgarian. Vulgarian. Whatever he is, he's got whiskers like a goat. Confound these French menus. They're Greek to me. What the devil's vol-au-vent Lyonnaise? Could I be of any help, sir? That's just a little p?t?, nothing much, you know. - Oh, thank you very much. - Not at all. And what's tournedos Grand-Duc? Oh, tournedos Grand-Duc Vladivy. - That's a steak. - Oh, steak! Oh, yes, that's better. Um... Pardon, monsieur, this is not your place. It is in the fumeur. Smoker. Ah, va bene. Thank you so much. At your service, Miss... I mean, not at all. - Let's try it. - Why not? - Sylvia! - What? Are you off your head? Stop! - Why should we? - Because I say so. Oh, now, Daddy, who won that bet, you or I? You'll have everybody after you in a minute. You know, people want to get a bit of sleep. Oh, Christmas! Adorable girl, adorable girl, adorable girl, adorable girl... ...adorable girl. I like you a lot, I like you a lot, I like you a lot... I like you a lot, I like you a lot, I like you a lot... Forgotten the bills, forgotten the bills, forgotten the bills... ...forgotten the bills, forgotten the bills. - Go and get your skis and come along. - I haven't got any skis. You can get them here. The place is opposite. Well, it wouldn't help much because I don't ski. Oh... well, I'd just as soon skate instead. Shall we do that? Well, I'm afraid I don't skate either. E expect Mr. Tracey plays games. I'm not terribly good at games. Then what do you do with yourself the whole time? Oh, I don't know. I manage to get along somehow. Oh, let's be going. Come along. How is it you never learned when you were a child? It seems that my childhood was quite different from yours. Why? Tell me. Your friends are waiting. Well, I really must go now. So sorry, Max. Max? Because he's like a portrait by a modern painter? - He doesn't resemble me in the least? - No. No? I have it! He doesn't speak, he doesn't skate... ...and he spends the whole day at the hotel. Yes. And he looks as dignified as you do. Goodbye, Parsifal. Goodbye. Good morning, sir. Would you mind filling in your registration form? I see... thank you. Have you got a pen? Yes, sir. I'm delighted to be here again, Herr Breslmeyer. Oh, your majesty. Now, Daddy, you mustn't get excited when he comes. We've all been asked not to get excited because of the presence of him. Excited over a king. - Everything all right? - It is all right, Your Majesty. Strict incognito. You may trust Breslmeyer. Very glad to see you, Mr. Westlach. Very glad to see you, my friend. Danke, Herr Breslmeyer. He's strictly incognito, Herr Breslmeyer? Oh, most strictly, Countess. He calls himself Mr. Westlach. Every year, His Majesty has said the same thing to me. I do not want to be taken any notice of. And every year he adds how he is so satisfied... ...with my tact, my discretion and with my audacity. Guten Morgen, mein junges Kind - Eure Majest?t. - Ah-ah! Max! Max! - Your Majesty. - Shh. I'm incognito. Oh, so am I, sir. And how go things at the Palace? All your guests quite happy? Oh, much the same as usual, sir. Everyone tends to be pessimistic before dinner... ...and optimistic after dinner. The ladies? The sins of the mothers have become principles of the daughters at the capital. - And our friends the politicians? Oh, they never change, sir. They always sin, and always on principle. Well, they haven't any principles. Breslmeyer! - Who is he? - I don't know. Omelette au gratin. Oh, omelette au gratin, that is a good idea. Give me the registration forms. Ah, here we are. No occupation! Of course, you ought to have known he was a prince. - Who, Mr. Tracey? - Oh, Mr. Tracey! He is a prince, incognito. Give me the Almanac de Gotha. Schafskopf! Max Egon Quentin Charles Laurence... ...Emile Leon Antoine... Prince de Westlach! And so, Max, you're incognito. And all because of a girl. Well, you know, Max, this incognito business is very dangerous. I remember once when I was a young man... I was incognito. And I met a little girl, the daughter of an innkeeper. and her one dream in life was that I might turn out to be a headwaiter But I didn't. Nothing is ever quite right in this life, Max. Well, come and tell me your little trouble. - Who is he, Sylvia? - He must be a prince. - He looks like a prince. - Who is he? I don't know. I always thought he must be something odd. Surely, sir, I'm as good as any other man who wants to marry a girl. Isn't it a shame that between sitting at a table... ...and waiting at the same table there should be a gulf as wide as the Atlantic? - You sit at my table, Max, - You're kind and wise. Don't you think a girl, the people, just for once... ...could be as kind and as wise as you are? Well, surely it's your job to handle people, society people. - Oh, it is, sir, yes. - It's mine also. Now, frankly, what's your opinion on that? Well frankly, sir, I think... I think they're a pack of backbiting fools. That's my opinion also. You can never expect any kindness or wisdom from them. You see, Max, a headwaiter is outside the pane of society. - Yes, but... - Yes, but so is a king. We're both in the same boat. We're both isolated. You see? Did old Breslmeyer deserve that, sir? It's all right for everyone else, but I have to know - Have to know what? - That you are incognito, Your Highness. Excuse me, Mr. Tracey. Ask His Majesty. If I'd known, you can rely upon my tact and my discretion... Mr. Tracey. I do rely on your tact and discretion... Herr Breslmeyer. What is it, Sylvia? Are you doing this without the royal permission, Your Highness? Oh, don't be ridiculous. The king can't tell me what to do. If he's just afraid that you might marry out of your position, you can tell him that... Yes, that I haven't a dot of chance as far as you're concerned, eh? - Exactly. Will you tell him that? - No. - Why? - He'd think I had gone out of my mind. He's got nothing to do with me. I'm perfectly free. If I choose to make a fool of myself by running after someone who... ...who doesn't care a straw for me, no one can stop me. - Is that true? - Unfortunately it is. And if I dance with you, will he come after you and stop us? - Are you quite sure? - Absolutely. Liar! His Majesty will stop the whole thing. Honestly, Max, do you think you're playing a game with that young woman? I don't know, sir. But I do know that... I had a good chance of winning the game... ...until yesterday. Until yesterday? Do you mean that er... ...our acquaintance has compromised it? Well, er, in a way, sir, yes. In a way? W-w-what do you mean? I don't often compromise people. Well, you see, sir... these idiots have got it into their heads that... ...in some way I must be related to you. Ah, that might be a drawback. And that you came here expressly to er... put a stop to er... ...a royal romance. Well, I suppose I ought to make some sort of reparation. No, no, no, sir. That would only make matters worse. - Oh, very likely... - Yes, sir. Yes, you see, I'll have to settle this situation myself. With your kind permission, sir. All right, Max. Sylvia... just... Liver? Liver. Well, here's to long life and good livers, Mr. Robertson. - Do you know my name? - Oh, I've known it for a long while. I know your name, sir, but... I must tell you that by conviction I'm a Republican. Well, if I can't agree with you, that is because of my profession. I have to be a monarquist. Yes, pretty tough job being a king nowadays. Well, that depends. I happen to be one of the sort who wants to remain a king. And that sometimes becomes, as you describe it, a pretty tough job. Yes, a God darn tough job. Well, here's health. And may long Your Majesty live to keep your job. Are you mad? You'll freeze to death. - I just want one word with you. - Well, I don't want one. Good. I'll freeze. In the morning when you come out there will be two snowmen under your window. Al right. Come up then, you eskimo Romeo. Well, what is it? I've come to tell you who I really am. I'm not interested in who you are. I know what you are. The most ridiculous thing in the world. A man running after a girl, eh? Exactly. No one can look dignified running. - I agree with you. - Least of all, such an exalted personage. Absolutely. To blazes with dignity. Who cares about social differences in the twentieth century anyway? - Who, nobody but fools. - Fools? - I'm glad you know. - Only too well. If two people are in love, social differences don't count a hang. - Say that again. - You heard me. I found it too good to be true. - If two people are in love... - "If" two people are in love. - There's no if about one of them. - No? No. How about the other? Well... I'm not quite so sure about the other one. Sylvia. Oh, how warm you are for a snowman. Warm? I've melted. Listen, Sylvia. No, you must be careful. There are a lot of royal espies about here. Listen, did you mean what you said just now about social differences? Every word of it. I'm so happy. I'm going to tell you something. - Not now. - Yes now, this very minute. - Listen, my sweet... - Shh! - There's my father. - Confound your father. - Good night, Miss Robertson. - Good night. Good night. - Aline, Aline! - Oh, mon Dieu, I'm here. Pack at once. What time is it? I want two trunks and I'll travel in my black ermine. You'd better go and find out what time the Golden Arrow goes... ...and order a car. - Is my bath ready? - What's the matter with you? Aha, that's why you want to go away in such a hurry. Hello, Sylvia. Hello, Max. Are you coming in for hot milk? Uh... yes, uh... - Yes, I'll be with you in two minutes. - All right, I'll meet you there. Oh, Max! What do you suggest for dinner, Max? Do the waiters in this hotel sit down with the guests? Smile. Go on, smile or I'll slap you. Darling, why did you leave London without a word? You blaggard. - I was ill, dearest. - Where's the woman, you liar. There isn't any woman. Really, there isn't. You can see for yourself. - There aren't any Englishwomen here. - Americans are even more dangerous. Oh, but nobody's dangerous when you're about. Peggy, you look more irresistable than ever. Um, I um... You must excuse me now, I'll be back in a moment. Is it very important, darling? Well, it's an appointment... - ...with a gentleman. - Oh. - You really must excuse me. - Go ahead, darling. - Yes. - I'll come with you, darling. Well... it isn't so important after all. Oh, do you think the sight of me would be too painful for this... gentleman? Why, you're a feast for any man to look at. Of course... this is a very peculiar gentleman. Oh, and is this peculiarity that he happens to be a lady? No, no, no, no... - He's a king. - You should present me. Oh, I'm afraid that's quite impossible, darling. You'd better do what I ask, darling. Otherwise I shall jump onto this seat... ...and shriek at the top of my voice, this is Max, Max, the headwaiter from the Grand Palace Hotel, London. Will you do it, darling? Well, I must ask him first, mustn't I? Go and ask him, darling. Well, all right. A ghost of the past, Max? A particularly lively ghost, Your Majesty. Well, every must play his own ghost. You're excused for the evening. - Your Majesty. - Anything else? Er... the ghost wishes to be presented to your majesty. - With what idea? - Well, er... The idea seems to be that uh... a king in a winter sports hotel... - ...is really just a tired businessman. - What? Oh, a very, very high-classed business, of course, Your Majesty. But still, more or less, just a tired businessman. In need of cheerful feminine companionship. Would it help you very much, Max? Oh, it would indeed, sir. Well, I'm sorry, it can't be done. Your Majesty positively refuses to be cheered up? To that extent yes. Well, he won't. - Oh... is the queen here? - No. He just won't. Wait and see. Darling, don't you think you ought to be getting dressed for dinner now? Are you so anxious to get rid of me? Well, are you so anxious? Not any more. What do you mean not anymore? Not any... Not at all, darling! No, absolutely, not at all! Not at all. Daddy, tomorrow we shall leave. - So you hate the place again. - I hate it! - Is Mr. Tracey here? - He will be down at any moment, Countess. Well, I'm only a silly old man, not a wise young girl. - But when I was young... - Oh, please, Daddy. Yes, we used to hate the place too. Even in those remote days we began to hate the place. But we didn't run away at once. - Oh, what can one do? - Stand and fight. And then you'll begin to like the place again. Do we go? No. We shall stay. Tell me, sir, who is that young man? Don't you know? He's incognito. Yes, but you're incognito too. Everybody knows who you are. Ah, but I'm afraid I mustn't give away his incognito. Max! Oh, Max! Max, do you know Miss Robertson? Yes... yes, yes. Yes. Yes, we have met once or twice. Sylvia is the most enchanting girl. Peggy's the darlingest woman I have ever met. It's amazing you haven't fallen in love with her already. In fact, I think it's quite impardonable of you. No man could fall in love with any girl after having met you, dear. - Oh, darling. - Darling Peggy. Dirty weather on the port bow. All hands on deck. Come along. With Your Majesty's permission, Countess Ricardi. - Most delighted. - How do you do, sir? - Mr. Robertson, Countess Ricardi. - How do you do? Milady. Dinner is... Dinner, sir. - Shall we go in, darling? - Yes, darling. - May I have one? - Certainly. Thank you. - How about a dance? (Both) Yes, I'd love to. Of course. Perhaps I may have the privilege this time. - Sorry, Max. - Not at all. A waltz, please. I want to say two words to you. Won't you stay here? Won't you come out, please? Well, it's a command, sir. - Will you excuse us? - I'll excuse you for his majesty... ...and for the countess. Well, here we are. What are the two great words? Good bye, Sylvia. - Are those the two words? - Just those. - Good bye. - Oh... All the evening you've seemed so hesitating. - Now you're so calm, so manly. - I was wretched all evening. Just a poor, weak, defenseless male. But now, with manly determination, I've decided to flee. - Tomorrow I leave. - But shall we never see one another again? I think never. I hope never. You hope? You say you hope? Yes, for your sake I hope. Come on, Sylvia. I think we've said everything. Have we... really said everything? Come on. Come on, Sylvia, you're shivering. I'm not shivering because I'm cold. You're a very bad liar, Sylvia. - Was that a lie, too? - Yes, that was a lie too. What was it? It was a kiss, Peggy. It seems to me, darling, that you have some old account to level. I'll leave you with His Highness. What's she babbling about His Highness? You forget, darling that I'm incognito. Oh, darling, thank you so much for reminding me. Now go ahead and jump on the table and tell them all about your incognito. Well? I wouldn't, Peggy. The truth can be very painful sometimes. You know that. I know. Besides, think of us here, with all these rich people, millionares, kings... Is it necessary for them to know all about our past? No, no, no. No... I'll tell you what's best. We're leaving here and you can come to me. Not now, darling. Remember, this is a most respectable hotel. A winter sports hotel. You're telling me what winter sports hotels are? I'll see you later, shall I? Meanwhile, let's go out and before all those people... ...you will bid me a magnificent good night. - A queenly fairwell. - Watch me. Are you really leaving? - Yes. - For good? Yes. Then I shall never see you again? No. Well, that's good! I never want to see you again! - Is that what you came to tell me? - Yes. No! I came... to tell you I think you're a... - A coward? - Yes. How did you know? Probably because I... I am a coward. Scared stiff by the unbridgeable gap of social differences? Yes, exactly. I'm scared stiff by the unbridgeable gap of social differences. You coward! Well, now you've told me what you came to tell me. And I can go? Well, I won't go. I... I want to talk to you. I want to pack. Excuse me. - Well, I must say you're a... - A magnificent packer, eh? You seem to read all my thoughts. Well... Do you know what I'm thinking now? I'll tell you. This is what you're thinking. It's the middle of the night, ...here I am in his bedroom. And? And he's a coward. Are you really a coward... Parsifal? Sylvia, for heaven's sake. You must go. Don't you see? I haven't the right. You must forget me. And now I suppose you'll go to that woman. Oh, no, I'm not going to her. But this... this is impossible. Oh. Well... So... this is good bye. Good bye. Good bye. - Hello? - Max, you're worse than I thought you were. - You're terrible. You know what you are? - Yes, a coward. - Well, when are you coming. - Soon, soon as possible. Yes, darling. No, darling. Yes, darling. Yes... no. Yes. Cheat! Liar! Cad! Rotter! Blaggard! Beast! Brute! Oh, cheat! Liar! Cad! Rotter! Blaggard! Beast! Brute! Sylvia. Sylvia. I swear I wasn't going to her. But I heard you say you'd see her at midnight. I was lying. Well,... I'll believe you... If you'll... Come in here with me now. No, no, no, someone might see us. Later. Kiss me. No, no, later. I'll come back. Oh, my little girl, what's the matter, what's happened? I told him to come to my room. Him? Who? - Tracey? - Yes. He'll be here any minute. Have you lost your senses? Why did you do it? - I'll teach him a lesson! - You'll do nothing of the kind! What, coming into a girl's room after midnight? - Leave him alone! - I'll smash him when he comes in! - What is it? - It's a letter, sir, for Miss Robertson. All right... yes. There are social differences that cannot be bridged over. Please forgive and forget me. The braggard! - Hey, porter! - Yes, sir? - Has that gentleman gone? - Yes, sir. Gone on the midnight train, sir. He's s scoundrel! - What's the matter? - He's gone on the midnight train. Then he's an honest man. Just tell me who he is, what he is and where he lives... and I'll have five minutes with him... I can't tell you now. But I leave tomorrow for London. If you'll give me the pleasure of your company next Wednesday night... ...at the Grand Palace Hotel, I'll tell you. Send Max for me, please. Mother, will you tell me who on earth this Max is. - Oh, a man of the world. - A philosopher. He knows more about smartness than the whole of Bond Street. And more about women... than Your Majesty. Now then, now then.. Oh, a young man about town. One of the smart set. He doesn't belong to any set. - The king. - What? - The king. - All right, thank you. Your Majesty. Your Grace. Well, here he is. - You've never really seen Max? - No, I've never seen him. Well, I'll be darned. You bet your life I have. I'm sorry, sir. I'm afraid you're mistaken. You are mistaken, Daddy. Waiters do sometimes remind you of... gentlemen. - Where have you been? - On my holidays, Your Grace. - Did you have a good time? - A splendid time, Your Grace. Well, it doesn't seem to have done you much good. You look dreadful. What's the matter, my dear boy? Don't you feel well? I never felt better in my life, Your Grace. Well, what do you think of my friend, Max. I like the man, sir. Your friend, sir? I'm afraid kings have a privilege that is denied to us ordinary mortals. We cannot choose our friends from headwaiters. Max, who in his way is a philosopher, would agree with you. He once told me that he thought it was a shame... that between waiting at a table and... What was it, Max? - Your Majesty? - Oh, yes. Between waiting at a table... and sitting down at the same table there was a gap as wide as er... - The Atlantic. - Nobody ever waded the Atlantic. No, madame. But several have flown it. All the women are in love with him. A dangerous man. For kitchen maids, and waitresses. - For all women. - All women? - Certainly not for me. - Oh, certainly for me. Have a care, young woman. You've protested too violently. I've always been safe from romantic headwaiters. Have you? - Oh, Max. - Yes, madame? I want to give a dinner and I would like you to look after it for me. I appreciate the honor, madam, but er... I'm afraid I can't undertake anything outside this restaurant. You see, the private routes are all tended by another... headwaiter. Daddy, you go to the manager, pay whatever they ask... ...but I must have Max! All right, all right. - Where is Max? - He'll be here directly, madam. Monsieur Max arrive always last minute, madame. - Never too late. - Here he comes, madam. - Good evening, sir. - Good evening. Beg your pardon, madame. - Please, just a minute. - Madam? Are headwaiters supposed to wear white ties with their tailcoats? You can depend on Mr. Max being absolutely correct, madam. He chooses his tie according to the occasion. He wears a white tie only for the higher upper classes... ...and never for the lower upper classes. - Thank you! - I beg your pardon. Max, where are you going? My professional duties, madam. Why didn't you pick it up? I? Oh, no, madam, that would never do. Not when I'm on duty. It would establish a personal relationship with the guest, which I am always most anxious to avoid. Haven't waiters got to do whatever a guest may want? Oh, yes, madame. And the first duty of a waiter is to keep perfectly calm... ...no matter how excited the guest may become. Like servants in a country house? Like doctors in a lunatic asylum. Well, is everything all right here? - Perfect, madame. - No, it's not. - There are no flowers. - There will be flowers. Flowers. - Flowers. - Flowers. - Flowers. - Flowers. Max. Why are you wearing a white tie, Max? Do you want to be taken for a gentleman? I like waiters in their proper place. Very good, madam. At your service, madam. I hate that girl. I'd like to give her a good smack. - Duchess! - Oh... I wish someone would give that girl a good smack. - Dinner is served, madam. - Thank you. Say... Do you think I'm a darned fool going to pretend not to know you? Why... How are you? - Not so well, Mr. Robertson. - No, and I'm not so well either. - Mr. Robertson... - Hm? I want to tell you how deeply I regret all this has happened. - Why should you? - I... I was forced into it... ...step by step, and I'm so sorry. There's a lady in there says she'd like to give that girl a good smack. And someone ought to do it. But not a woman, a man. And you're the man to do it. But you always seem to forget what I am. I'm a waiter. You're a darned fool. You know what I was when I first went to Johannesburg? I was a dishwasher in an eating house. But I knew what I wanted, and I went after it. And I got it. - Do you really mean... - I mean. Go and get it. Why are you standing still? Why aren't you going to look after my guests? You said everything would be all right. Don't you ever keep any of your promises? I'm going to keep one now. In the mountains I promised to come into your room and kiss you, didn't I? I mean it. No, no, Max, not here. Well? I beg your pardon. Will you excuse me just.. just a minute? - Is this a blackmail? - Absolute blackmail. A gentleman wouldn't do it. I'm not a gentleman. I'm beginning to like that girl. I think perhaps I had better go and find out... ...what has happened to our charming hostess. I gather we shall all have to wait a little while. Max. Lend me your handkerchief. Ride right on. Mind you, I'm not the sixth son of an earl... No. My five elder brothers will never break their necks out hunting. No. - I'll never be an earl. - No. - You'll never be a countess. - No. You'll just be... Yours. Subtitles: Lu?s Filipe Bernardes
