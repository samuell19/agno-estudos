So he took up his tools and he worked night and day, made the most perfect toy, then he gave it away. That little horse saved Christmas in the winter before, but now it may need to save it once more.

Thanks for the sweater Becky, but it is way colder than LA. -Feeling homesick yet? -A little. It's weird being without my family, but... I had to stay for Raven. Anyways, it's cool. I'm gonna make the perfect Christmas for me and my grandpa. I'm thinking lights, decorations, some eggnog... -Egg-what? -You're going to love it. Come on, you know my grandpa literally has one decoration. [Becky] Sounds like he needs our help. [birds chirping] [door closes] -Hi, Frank. -Hiya, Frank! -What's all that? -Oh, wow. Okay. This... This is worse than I... thought. Serious case of tinsel-itus. And there's only one thing for it. Ladies, decorations stations. What are you lot up to? Say hello to your first Pony Squad Christmas.

Right, well, we better get to the stables. It's nearly Christmas showtime. -You're coming, right, Frank? -Wouldn't miss it. -See you guys there. -See you in a bit. Oh, we forgot one more decoration. This is beautiful, Grandpa. Where'd you get it? Someone made it for me a long time ago. Sadly, there's no more room on that tree. Oh, well. Well, we'll make room. There. Perfect. -[gasps] -No! Oh, Grandpa! I'm so sorry. Why am I so clumsy? It's okay. It doesn't matter now anyway. So... more mince pies? I'll make this right, Grandpa. I promise. Thank you. See you there! Roll up! There's still time to get tickets to the Bright Fields Christmas show! You've hardly got any left. You must have sold loads! Well, Bob ate most of them, but there's still time to sell out. Who is that? Mia's dad's new girlfriend. I heard she's a model. Do you need help, darling? I could drop some invites off in town. -Oh, that would be-- -Dear, the shops will be opening soon. ...totally not required. It's fine, Daddy. I got it all under control, but I'll see you later? Bye. He's taking her shopping. He must really like her. Gaby! I need you to muck out Firefly's stable, and when you're done, could you clean out his feed bucket and fill up his haynet. Thanks. I work for the yard, not for you. Well, actually, while Pin's traveling, I'm in charge. Not technically true. And I just don't have the time for menial tasks. In case you hadn't noticed, It's my family's famous Mistletoe Ball tonight. And I'd just really appreciate help from our new stable hand. Don't you find it ironic how you came here pretending to be a cleaner and now you basically are one? So let me get this straight. Your dad was too poor to rebuild the stables, but all of a sudden, he can throw some massive party. He's not throwing it. Mia is. No, I see. You're making sure Daddy doesn't forget you now he's got a shiny new girlfriend. [girls giggling] Awkward. Like I said, I work for the yard. Not for you. Ta-da! And then I'll say, "Thank you everyone for coming to our Bright Fields festive show. Merry Christmas and a Horsey New Year!" That is so clever. Brilliant. Horsey New Year? Are you... -me? -No. I'm Winnie. Like the sound a horse makes. -I used to have a jumper like that. -It's yours. I bought your old clothes from a charity shop. -Becky has a super fan. -And Bob. I love them both equally. [whinnies] Well, nice to meet you, Winnie. Welcome to the yard. But if you'll excuse us, we have a show to organize. -We still have to sort out lighting-- -Me! Pick me! -I love lighting. -I'm not sure-- -You know, when it's all light and stuff. -You've got the gig! -I want you to think big. -If I may speak-- -Think... So gigantic you can see it from Mars? -You've got it. -I think less is more. And less is less expensive. Right. Of course. -You hear that, guys? -Yes, Producer Jade. I had my fingers crossed. What do you mean? I'm going to make Becky's dreams a reality. -[neighs] -Easy, boy. He'll be here in a minute. -Hey, sorry. My train was delayed. -No worries. -How are you? -Good. Let's go. Cheers for this. Mia will kill me if we don't make it back in time for her ball. Luckily, I've never missed one. Zoe's got no idea you're coming home? Nope. Thought I'd surprise her. She's gonna go nuts. She won't be the only one. The Duke is coming back to the island. -Yeah, yeah. -They'll be rolling out the red carpet, hoisting the flag, and polishing the Duke mobile. -That's enough. -[engine revs] Are you guys headed South? Well, all the buses are full and I've got a kid's party to get to. -Sorry mate, we're kinda in a rush. -Jump in. Oh. Thanks! What? You can't say no to an elf on Christmas Eve. Come on. There must be one in here. We decked out the tack room. Can you tell? Zoe? What are you looking for? -A horse. -I don't think one would fit in there. It's for my grandpa. I broke his decoration. You know, he's been a little down since Wilma left, but... this is different. I feel like he's almost trying to hide something. More mince pies maybe? Look, you can glue it. Well, I already tried that, but it won't hold. Becky, look. No way. What is it? What am I missing? Okay, so this was made on the island. By a famous toy maker that used to give them to the kids on Christmas Eve. It's a proper island legend. -He was so kind. -He's a real jolly gent. -What happened to him? -No one knows. -I heard he lives out in the woods. -Yeah, but he has to keep a low profile because he is basically O.S. O.S.? Original Santa. He marked his name on the chest. Look. That is basically scientific proof right there. Well, we need to find this O.S. and get him to make my grandpa another horse. -Who's with me? -Me. Me. Gaby? Gaby. Gaby! Are you living here? Oh, that's a sleeping bag. Oh, you are aren't you? Whatever, it's not a big deal. It's just... -Just till I get things sorted. -What happened to Holloway? They kicked me out. But I would really appreciate it if you didn't say anything about this to anyone. Your secret's safe with me. -Really? -As long as you do exactly what I say. [sighs] [shivers] Are you sure this is a good idea? The performance is at midday, -we haven't sorted the lighting out-- -Relax, Jade. Pony Squad-mas is a go. Pony Squad-mas? I knew you'd approve. Gaby! Could you please hurry up? I want Firefly's stable sparkling before I leave. -On it. -Good. Who turned Gaby into the helpful elf? Gaby! Hay, girl. Wanna go on a ride with us today? I can't... sorry. Mia wants Firefly's stable mucked out. Wait, I'm sorry. For a moment I thought you said Mia wants Firefly's stable mucked out. -What's going on? -I'm just helping out. Yeah. I was born yesterday. Maybe I'd rather muck out a stable than go on your lame ride. Okay, then. Is this it? Doesn't seem very jolly. [Becky] Maybe it gets more jolly the further in you go? [Jade] It's kind of creepy. Original Santa's house! Well, this is the place. Oh my Bob. Guys, look! A sleigh! Santa! Becky! Okay. Here goes nothing. Maybe this isn't such a good idea. This guy is a legend. He's the spirit of Christmas. I for one can't wait to see his jolly face again. [knocking at door] [knocking] -He's not here. -Guess we better go then! -Jade, we can't just give up. -Guys, he's coming! Santa's coming! Santa! Owen, actually. Sure you are... [whispers] "Owen." Are you carol singers? -No. -We could sing. I hate carol singers. Or not. So? What do you want? I accidentally broke a decoration, and I was hoping you could fix it. Where did you get this? It was my Grandpa's. Frank Steel? I think you made it for him back in, like, 1500 or something. Get off my land. -Huh? -Get away from here! Go on! Scram! If ever there was a time to find your inner speed demon Bob, it's now! That man was definitely not Santa. It was like he had one look at that Christmas decoration and went crazy. Owen... Come on, Zoe. Before he catches us in his mean old sleigh. [Jade] We should be getting the Christmas show ready anyway. What is that? The invite said "black tie," Marcus. It didn't say anything about a tux. Well Pin, "black tie" is just a rich person's way of saying "suit up." Mia wouldn't mind if I didn't have one, though. Have you met Mia? Trust me, you need a suit. -I haven't got a suit. -I've got a suit. -Is it an elf suit? -Yes. -I'll pass. -Don't worry, I always carry a spare. -Lights have changed. -Let's go, go, go. Ferry will be leaving soon. -Are you boys from the island? -Ignore her. -Hello. -Hi. I need to drop a turkey off at my daughter's house, but my car is on the blink and I really need-- Sure. We can help. -Thank you. -Pin, what are you doing? We're going the same way. You can just put the turkey in the... [gobbles] Thanks. ...back. It's looking at me funny. I think it likes you. Just drive. -[engine revs] -[turkey clucks] Oh, I know, I know. It's chaos, but it's going to be perfect. This all looks very... expensive. Does it? Oh... good. It's like a smaller version of that gala we went to last week, isn't it, darling? By the way, your bruschettas are a touch overdone. You might want to have a word with the chef. Thanks. I've always dreamed of being invited to the Mistletoe Ball and now here I am... basically guest of honor. -It's like a fairy tale come true. -And I'm your handsome prince. Aww. [laughs] You okay? Yeah, why wouldn't I be? It's just that your dad's girlfriend is really young, and a bit mean, and... He is going to be so impressed when he sees this all come together. Especially with the singer you booked. Do you really think so? Yeah. I do. It's nice doing things for other people, isn't it? Makes you feel good. What's your point? I think we should invite Gaby to the ball. Oh! Very funny, Susie. Oh, I told you, mistletoe to the right! Come on, we've got work to do. How are you getting on? I can't go any faster, if that's what you mean. No, I'm not here because of Mia. So you wanna dig too? Why don't you ever stand up to her? -I do. -No. You always let her win in the end. -No, I don't. -You're the same with Callum. I broke up with him. Well, at least his new girlfriend looks like she can stand up for herself. Oh, you didn't know? Yes, he's moved on. Ouch. You know, we're all trying to like you. But you don't make it easy. Well... why don't you save yourself the bother and leave me alone? -So, what do you think? -Becky's going to flip out. -In a good way? -In the best way! -Wanna see 'em? -Yeah. I put them on the roof, too. [whirring] Too much? Nuh-uh. They're epic. [sizzling] I'm sure it'll be fine. "Dear Owen, I know you won't read this, but I wish you all the joy there is this Christmas." O.S. Owen Steel? [clears throat] Grandpa, do you have a brother? -I did. Well, I do, but-- -And he made this? Yes, he did. Well, I met him today. You went out to the cottage? Yeah, I wanted to get you a new decoration, but... -he's kind of mean. -Yes, I'm afraid that's Owen. We used to be close, but we had a bit of a falling-out. I still send him a card every year, but well, it's been 30 years of silence. Maybe it's time to give up. Now we can get on with this perfect Christmas of yours. [phone chimes, buzzes] Oh my Bob, oh my Bob. There's so many people here. I invited all of the yard and their parents, and their parents' parents, and now I'm seriously regretting that. We will be fine. It's a simple little show... [audience chattering] Okay, I know that look. I invented that look. What have you done? [Winnie] You're going to be blown away. Gaby... I wanted to talk to you about my Ball. Do you have plans tonight? We were wondering if... Yeah? If you could pick up some shovels. -What? -We're expecting heavy snow tonight, and I need you to keep the drive clear for my guests. Go, Becky! That's Alex. I kissed him once. I know. I read your blog. -I signed up for the alerts. -That was you? Everyone's here.

[cheering] No way. -Mia, this is incredible. -Do you really think so? -I want a photo of us. Gigi? -I'd love to. Sorry, I meant could you take it? Absolutely. You do like her, don't you? Yeah, of course. I just want you to be happy. Perfect family photo. I'll get us a drink. Gigi, you've got your finger over every single one of them. Oh gosh, have I? That's the trouble with these diamond manicures. By the way, the path outside is like an ice rink. You really ought to get that sorted. Ooh, cocktails. How quaint. Look. I think Gigi ruined every single photo on purpose. And where is Gaby? -She's supposed to be sweeping the path. -[crash] [phone rings] Hello? Mia's phone, Susie speaking. How can I-- Oh, no. That's not good news. Yeah, I'll be sure to let her know. Come on boy, just a little further. Owen... are you in here? Uncle Owen? Uncle Owen? Hello? "Dearest Owen, happy Christmas my brother. I hope to see you soon." I mean, he opened them. So then he must care. Where are you? [horse neighs] What is it, boy? [distant shouting] Help! Help! -Okay. It's okay. Can you walk? -Does it look as though I can walk? -How long have you been out here? -Only about an hour. We have to keep you warm. No, I think I'll stay here and rest a while. No. Owen, listen to me. Owen, wake up! Owen! Help! Help! Help! [horse whinnies] -Is he okay? -No. He's frozen to the core. Let me help you get him back to the house. No, there's no central heating, no logs. We can't stay here. -Can Raven carry him? -No. He's dead weight. Well, then, we're gonna need a Christmas miracle. Okay, I have an idea. [wind howling] [bells jingling] Come on! Come on, Raven. You got this! [Zoe] That's it, Firefly! Keep going! You're loving this, aren't you? They say you should try something new every day. Come on, Raven! The snow is getting pretty bad. I know, I know, I know. This old guy really isn't doing so well. Less of the old. Hang in there. We're almost there. Maybe we should turn around. Gaby, this is the only way. -Come on. -Zoe? -Zoe! -She should be back by now. Raven's not in his stable. She's still out there. What if she's lost? We have to do something. Becky, how hard can you pedal? Why have we stopped? We're lost, aren't we. Zoe? I can't see anything. The snow's too thick. This is serious. He's really bad. No, look! What is that? Bright Fields. -Can you see her? -Keep going! Keep going. Got it. Come on, boys. Follow the lights! You're not going to believe this! Santa! -Zoe! -Even better! It says there's another midnight crossing. Christmas Eve timetable. I don't make the rules. And there's nothing that you can do? Sorry, guys. We'd have made it if you hadn't kept picking up random weirdos. No offense. -None taken. -Don't mention it. It's Christmas, Marcus. Was I supposed to just leave them? Well, now we're not gonna make it to the party, Pin. That's exactly what you wanted. -Isn't it? -What? You know what I mean. Where's Becky? She said she'd meet me here, but when I called her, she sounded weirdly out of breath. Susie? You okay? It's a disaster, Alex. Mia booked a singer as a surprise for her dad, but they're stuck on the mainland. -Okay. What's your plan? -Leave the country and never return? Okay. Before you do that... I might have a better idea. Grandpa! Now, what's going on? I was about to turn in. Owen. This way. There you go. I'll just get warm and then I'll be on my way. Don't be daft. You're welcome here. You always have been. Spare me the dreaded Christmas spirit. I'd have thought you would have thrown that out years ago. I treasure it. Clearly. Snapped in two. Well, I mean, that was me. We used to give these out to the kids on the pier, remember? -From the sleigh. -Free to a good home. -Then a penny. Then a pound. -I did well for myself. Is that a crime? -You forgot where you came from. -I certainly didn't. I made sure every day of my life that I wasn't going to end up... broke and hopeless like Dad. I'm not going to apologize for my success. I had a talent. -Made me rich. -Yes, but it also made you cold. And that's why Beth chose me. Wait a minute. Grandpa, did you steal Uncle Owen's girlfriend? He didn't have time for her. He broke your grandma's heart. That's true. I did. -Well, can we fix this? -It's too late. -He's too stubborn. -He never sees my point of view. No, I'm talking about this. There's some things that you can't fix and some things you can. Yeah. I haven't got my tools. You kept them? Just in case. Come on, for old time's sake. -Is he okay? -Yeah. He's got a mug of Grandpa's hot chocolate and three decades of sibling issues to catch up on. He'll be fine. Okay, well... I better get back to Holloway. Gaby, wait. Can you please tell me what's wrong? And don't shut yourself off from all of us. Be less Owen. He pushed people away and ended up on his own. Then at least come to the Ball. I mean, Mia would actually go mad. Seriously? Another good reason to go. I don't have anything to wear. So this is where my fifth grade performance of being the Fairy Godmother comes in handy. Cinder-Gaby, you shall go to the Ball.
