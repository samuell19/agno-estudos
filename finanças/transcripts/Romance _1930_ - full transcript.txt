- Happy New Year! - Ah, nuts.. Happy New Year, Jason. You know, you mustn't hurry like that anymore. - It's bad for your heart. - I won't, sir. - Happy New Year to you, sir. - Oh, thank you. - Is grandfather in there? - He's resting, sir. - I'll tell him you're here. - Fine. - And hurry up, hurry up. - Yes, sir. Better start the New Year right. Mr. Harry, is calling, sir. Sorry, if I seem to burst in but, uh, the major said you wanted to see me. It was more or less Carrie's idea. Oh, yes. Mother's idea. Mm-hmm. Well, I suppose you've heard. I'm casting shame and disgrace upon the family. I'm going to marry an actress. 'Well, I am.' Because I love her. Good, Harry. But are you quite sure, my boy, that you'll always love her just the way you love her now? And that nothing hidden in the future or in the past.. ...can ever shake your faith and break your heart? Oh, I've heard all that from mother. I... oh, I'm sorry, sir, I.. But after all, you know, you are a bishop. And no bishop could possibly know anything about love. Well, I didn't mean that exactly but.. Oh, I-I know you're awfully wise, and you understand people and can see right through them and all that. But this is different. I don't believe you will be able to understand this. Why, it's been so long since you were young. It must be hard for you to remember back. You think so, Harry? What's the matter, grandfather? Rheumatism? Don't mention rheumatism now, my boy. I'm only 28 years old. Don't take it off, Harry. I've been playing that all evening. Do you know what's in this little box? Romance, my boy. The perfume of romance. 'What is it? A handkerchief" A little handkerchief. And a rose. Mm, it's dried and yellow now. And the sweetness.. ...is all gone. Well, I'm an old man, Harry. But sometimes, somehow, it.. Why, it seems just like yesterday. What, sir? That's what I'm going to tell you, my boy. Sit down. - Are you comfortable there? - Uh-huh. That's fine. Well, Harry, it was over 50 years ago. 50 years. Dear me, how time flies. I was the young rector of St. Giles then. That was before I married your grandmother, God bless her. Although I've known her nearly all my life. Well, one night, in November, it was. I went to an evening party to Cornelius Van Tuyl's house. And there in that kaleidoscope of jewels and flowers and crinolines.. ...the great adventure of my life began. They were dancing the Polka. Oh, it was a lovely dance. I think all the most beautiful women in New York were there that night.. You have on your oldest clothes. I was gonna change but little Jimmy Baxter ran in to say that young Sullivan was drunk again and killing his wife and so would I please step over. - Oh, what are you looking at? - Your hair. Bend over. And I-I found Sullivan in a fighting mood and rather difficult to manage. In the middle of it all, if Mrs. Sullivan didn't go and have another baby. Oh, how terrible. - Susan. Susan. - Yes, uncle Cornelius. Madame Cavallini has arrived here. I hope you remember me. We met once in St. Petersburg.. I didn't really believe he'd do it. Of all the disgraceful insults that ever I.. Oh, the man must be out of his head. - Who? - Van Tuyl. - What on earth has he done? - Done? Don't you know whom he's introducing to every respectable woman who's been fool enough to come here tonight? Cavallini. Oh, you mean that foreign opera singer? - Well, what of it? - What of it? When it comes to asking all New York to parties given for his mistress. Have you quite finished? Then I have few things to say to you. I'll begin by telling you what you are and that's a miserable, sneaking, gossiping old woman. Hold on, wait a moment... You're a guest in a gentleman's house and you're turning around and circulating filthy, vicious lies behind his back. They're not lies. He's lived with her for years. - And he's not the only one. - You dirty scandal monger. Well, well, well. What's the matter? Oh, oh, nothing. Tom and I were having an argument, that's all. Good heavens, I must be getting home. But why? Madame Cavallini is going to sing. I'd rather my wife heard Madame Cavallini across the foot line. A touch of prejudice, no doubt. Don't pay any attention to it. Goodnight. Well, I seem to have come in at a bad moment, Tom. I'm glad you came, Mr. Van Tuyl, because I wanna talk to you. I am a very good listener, Tom. I don't know just how to begin, sir. It's-it's something that I, uh, I feel I really ought to... It's about Susan, isn't it? My dear boy, I'm as glad as I can be. - Sir, I don't follow you. - Why, aren't you asking me if... I'm sorry, sir. But it's advice I wish to offer you. Oh, oh, advice. Well, in that case, pray, go on. - Uh, shall we sit down? - No, thanks. After all, I am your rector, and I-I feel I've got to.. Now, this Madame Cavallini. Are you quite sure that she's the.. She's the sort of lady or the type... - Tom, how old are you? - Uh, twenty eight. Life is very simple when we are 28. - If one has standards, yes. - Oh, yes, yes, of course. I had all those once. One day, I got them all mixed up. The wrong seemed right, and the right seemed wrong. I just didn't know where I was at. Oh, come, sir. But that was a long time ago, my boy. But I'm dashed if I ever got 'em straight again. You know, Tom, there are no people in the world who are really bad. Just some poor devils who find it harder to be good than you. - That's all. - And Madame Cavallini? If Madame Cavallini weren't fit to meet my friends you wouldn't see her in my house tonight. Why, I might have known there wasn't a word of truth... Well, my boy, could I give you a word of advice? I'm afraid I have some advice coming to me, sir. What is it? Tom. You go upstairs and comb your hair That's sound advice, sir. Thank you very much for your kind escort, gentleman. Who was that? That's Tom Armstrong, he's a clergyman. Abbey, priest, you know? Uh-huh. - Well, it was that then. - What? Well, I don't know. Oh, just something in his eyes. I don't think he's ever seen anything like you before in all his life. No, he is very handsome too. Oh, you little monkey, you. 'Rita, Rita, Rita.' I repeat, you're just like that little pet of yours. A delightful full-fledged little monkey. And my American, does he like his friend tonight? I don't believe he could help it if he tried. Oh, why don't he kiss her then? Oh... there. Why I forgot, Cornie, I'm very angry at you. So? You know that you've treated me very bad tonight. What have I done? I've invited you to my house. And it is not tonight alone only. It's ever since I've come to your disagreeable country. It was not like this at Mille fleurs, was it? I wasn't there just an opera singer. Mille fleurs, our palace of a thousand flowers. Oh, do you remember, Cornie? The night I sang the Schubert serenade for you? And you walked up and down below the window. And all the roses in the world blossomed in the moonlight. And the wind and the sea and the big, old moon. Ah, that was Mille fleurs. The roses there brought me back to my youth. I came home and lost it forever, my dear. Oh, no. It waits for you among the flowers. I'm 51 years old. - Does that frighten you? - Oh, no. No, Rita, don't deny it. I know exactly how you must feel. You know, Rita. My hair wasn't nearly so white that last year at Mille fleurs. And I'm beginning to get a little deaf too. I find myself falling asleep in chairs and dreaming about tomorrow's dinner, and my rheumatism came back last week. Oh. Oh, now, don't blame me. I can't help getting old. I wish you wouldn't talk that way, Cornie. I'm not complaining. I've lived my life, and it's been very sweet. But the fact remains, I've lived my life. 'Don't you waste your springtime in a stupid old fellow' 'fifty-one years old.' - Alright. - 'What's the matter?' - Nothing. - 'Oh, yes, there is.' It's just one more friendship finished, Cornie. One more. - Rita. - Well, Mr. Van Tuyl. Haven't you ever loved someone? I don't understand you. And I loved you for two-three years. I don't mean that. I mean, isn't there someone whose memory is very dear and sort of holy? No. Sometimes, I wish that I'd died before I ever hear those words. "I love you." What do you mean by that? What is love? It's made of kisses in the dark and hot breath on the face, of heart that beats with terrible, strong blows. Love is just a beast that you feed all through the night. And when the morning comes.. ...love dies. Well, what do you think of me? I'm so hard, eh? Rita, why don't you marry someone? Why should I marry? Perhaps, I'm like you. Remember the stuff Rossini gave me the first time I met you? I asked someone, "Is he married?" And he said, "Mr. Van Tuyl is not the marrying kind." So I laughed, and I said "Perhaps, I'm not the marrying kind either." - And I saw you look at me. - Of course. And I smiled. Oh, it was very sweet. And so we begun. Cornie, come here. - Do you know what I think? - I never know. I mean, I don't think that we have come quite to the end. You make me very happy. Then will you drive with me tomorrow afternoon at four? Hm. I am honored. Oh, I'm forgetting. I'm a host. And they'll all be waiting for the golden nightingale. Oh, let me rest alone, Cornie, till the time for me to sing. And, Cornie, please send someone with lemon juice and red wine. Of course. I'll come for you when it's time to sing? Yeah. - Where are you going? - What? - I-I beg your pardon. I... - Oh, don't go, please. But I, I was, I thought... No, you know I was begin to be a little lonely And now you come along just in time Won't you sit down? Thank you. Oh, yes, but why do you sit way over there? You're afraid of me, aren't you? I'm not gonna hurt you, really. Please sit over here. You're very kind. Oh, what makes your face so red? My face? Oh, it's reddest thing that I've ever seen. - It's rather warm in here. - You think so? I'm quite cold. That's very odd. I'm afraid I haven't had the honor of being presented. My name's Armstrong. Tom Armstrong. I'm the rector of St. Giles Church. Oh, nice. And St. Giles, who's that? Some little American saint? Saint Giles is one of the most important figures in the great history of the Church of England. Oh! How terribly nice. We never hear of him in my country, you know? In your country? Why, where do you live? I have a house in Florence and a villa on the Riviera. Oh. Oh, you know for a moment, I-I thought you were one of those Italian opera singers. How strange. But you see there are lot of them downstairs. Even this Madame Cavarini or Lini, whatever her name is. Yes, I know. And what do you think of her? - You find her interesting? - I? Oh, I haven't seen her. I don't go to the opera. Oh, you haven't missed much when you miss Cavallini. She's very ugly. And so fat. Oh, why, she eats 12 pounds spaghetti every day. And she has an eye made out of glass. And I must tell you something horrible about her. You know, she has a hump on her back. Her dressmaker in Paris told me. Now, what do you think of that? - Do you really want to know? - Yes, tell me. I think you've been guilty of the grossest cruelty. To hear a woman, especially an attractive woman like yourself hold up to ridicule a less fortunate being. One who in spite of the grievous handicap of physical infirmities is still one of God's creatures. Oh, don't. That you take delight in doing this even to your worst enemy is cruelty itself. Oh, can't stand this. Alright. I'm glad my few simple words have touched you. - I can't... - Madame... Wine, Madame. Oh, put it over there, please. - Goodnight. - Oh, you're not going. After what's occurred, I see no reason for staying. Oh, alright. Goodnight. But aren't you sorry for making fun of me? Oh, frightfully sorry. You don't look it. Is that so? Addio. I thought you go. As long as you're sincerely sorry. I... I don't suppose there's any need of my going. Now you see, how nice I've done this. There. That's for you. - Thanks, I don't want it. - Not even if I give them? Or not even if I'll tell you I'm very sorry I made fun of you? Now, what do we drink to? Oh, should we drink to the nice clergyman of St. Giles? You don't like that. How do you like then if I drink to what I see in your eyes and you drink to what you see in mine? Who are you? Tell me, I don't understand. - 'What's your name?' - Oh, why do you ask? Because I want to see you again. I want to ask you things I never dreamed about until tonight. No, young man. All that can never be... It must. It's got to be. Well, do you see my flowers here? So fresh and beautiful. - You're crushing them. - Oh, what does it matter? They were born to die. Our meeting here tonight, what is it but a bunch of flowers that we love and smell and... throw away? Why should we take them home with us and watch them die? Couldn't I keep just one or two? Ah, but you are young. Come. Oh, I wish I knew a flower that will never die. No, no, no, don't do that now. Oh, Mr. Van Tuyl, how nice of you to come. - Are you ready, madame? - Quite ready. Thank you, monsieur, for your kind politeness. - But I want to see you again. - You cannot see me again. - But I must. - Are you sure? - Yes. - Quite sure? Yes! Very well. Come to my hotel tomorrow afternoon at four. It's the Brevoort house, you know, right over there. And our engagement at four tomorrow, madame? What becomes of that? Our little engagement is postponed indefinitely. I must really go now. But you know, you haven't even told me your name. Ah, how stupid. I forgot. Will you tell him, Mr. Van Tuyl? You really mean to say you didn't know who she was? I'd like to have a river named after me. I'm sure someone will. A-ah! Oh, Tom. Oh, it's you. Well, monsieur, you don't take the trouble to have yourself announced. I may be wrong, but I thought I might not be received. Maybe you were not wrong. Seems a long, long time since we met. Not since the night I sang at your beautiful soirée. For me also, it seems a very long time. Ah, that's better. - And now, what do you want? - What do I want? Rita, I want you to pretend for five minutes that I'm your father confessor. - You want to scold me, huh? - That depends. Has Tom asked you to marry him? - No. - And if he did? If he.. Oh, why? Cornie, he would want me to stop singing and live in this horrible New York. Most disagreeable place I ever saw. Oh, no, my friend. I-I wouldn't marry him. That will be the biggest mistake. Then, why do you lead the poor boy on? He is not like the other men you've known. He isn't like that baron or captain you know or that poor little Pole who tried to kill himself in London last spring. Oh, Cornie, you don't understand. Oh, do I have to explain, you know. Uh, how long have I known him? Six weeks, alright. In all that time, he has not spoke one word of love to me. - Not one single word. - What? Oh, at first, I tried to get him to. You know, just for fun. Then somehow, I feel sorry for him. And I don't try anymore. My poor Rita. Don't you realize, there's nothing in all this for you, my dear Oh, yes. Oh, I have so often said "don't see him when he comes today. "Tell that gentleman downstairs that you're asleep and nobody can disturb you." Why didn't you tell him then? Oh, I said-I said nobody, you know nobody likes that.. ...except Tom. I think you smiled a little, huh? No, no, I'm not smiling, my dear. Oh, Cornie. I'm such a fool. I believed I was so wise. You think if I go away that he'll forget me soon? I hope he will. I don't think I'll forget him or if I do, it'll take a long time, I'm sure. Oh, there is only one thing I know. 'What is that, my dear?' I love him, Cornie. I love him. Rita, if you do love him, you must break it off. You must not allow him to come here anymore. If you do, you're gonna cause him to suffer a very great deal. Oh, no, no. I warn you, my dear, it rests with you. His happiness or heartbreak? Alright, Cornie, I'll not see him again. The next time he comes, I'll not be at home. And I'll never be at home for him. And now you go, Cornie, I'm a little tired. Of course, you are. Thank you, my dear. I knew I could rely on you. Signorina, he's downstairs. - Who, Mr. Tom? - 'Si, si.' - I'm not at home. - Signorina, it is impossible. Oh, don't you hear what I say? I'm not at home. And I will never be at home for him again. Oh. Don't stand staring at me. Go and do what I tell you? Oh, Tom. 'Mr. Tom.' 'Oh, please come back.' Oh, not too much coal, Amos. It's outrageous the way things are going up. - It's two dollars a ton now. - Yes, Miss Armstrong. And it will never get higher than it is now. Tom, I.. Oh, Amos told to come right in and.. I was expecting to see Tom. Happy New Year, Miss Armstrong. - Yes, yes, happy New Year. - Aren't you both premature. It's only New Year's eve. How do you do, Mr. Van Tuyl? Looking as charming as ever, Miss Armstrong. Tom asked me to stop in at 4 o'clock and hear the final arrangements for midnight service. Is he upstairs? No, he went out after luncheon to-to pay a call. Oh, to the Brevoort House? Oh, no, he has a vestrymen's meeting at a quarter to five. And I'm sure he wouldn't miss that. Wouldn't he? Well, we'll see. Oh! What lovely roses. Yes, they are mine. They arrived just a moment ago. - And without a card too. - Aha! An anonymous admirer. How foolish. But it's the first time in years that anyone has sent me any flowers. I think I'll go home. I mean, as long as Tom isn't here. You're not going uptown, but the driver can take me home. Yes, good idea. I don't like to keep the horses standing. - Goodbye, my dear. - Goodbye. You won't either of you tell Tom I was here. Will you? - If you don't want to know. - Of course, we won't. Oh, Mr. Van Tuyl, I'm at my wit's end. I'm worried, so terribly worried about that Cavallini woman. Yes, I know, I know. You're Tom's oldest friend and his father's and mother's before him. You must talk to him. I've talked to him as my own son. He was very sweet, but somehow he wasn't quite there. - Not the real Tom, I mean. - Yes I know, I have seen it. He's with her. Now, now, now. Don't be alarmed, Miss Armstrong. Just remember, she is sailing tomorrow and.. Miss Armstrong. Madame Cavallini. Not Madame Cavallini. That woman. I won't see her. There ought to be a law against such women. Why, I'd sooner have a hungry tigress come into the room and.. Madame Cavallini. You're Mr. Tom's aunt? I'm Rita Cavallini. Tom went over to the parish house. He'll be back in a little while he said. So I come first to make my respect to you, Miss Armstrong. Ah, Mr. Van Tuyl. I did not expect to see you. How are you? What is that? - Oh, it's Adelina. - Adelina? I call her so because she looks so much like Adelina Patti. I think she have forgot you, sir. Yes, you ladies can forget so quickly. Yes! I wish you men would forget a little too. Why, it's all dressed up? Perhaps you like to hold her. Oh, no, no. Here, here, take it away, take it away. I think she's gonna bite me, Mr. Van Tuyl. Mr. Van Tuyl. Come, come, Adelina. Come here. Yes. We'll take a little nap. Ah! The roses. Did you like them, I choose every one myself. You sent me those? Just a little surprise to remember me two or three days after I've gone so far. Thank you. You're very kind. Mr. Van Tuyl'll put you in your sleigh whenever you're ready. Goodbye, madame. I wish you a pleasant voyage. When Madame Cavallini goes won't you step up to my sitting room and have a cup of tea? Why did she go away so quickly? It's just as well because I want to have a little talk with you alone. Cornie, don't be angry with me. I know I promised I wouldn't see Tom again. I did try, really, for a whole minute. But I'll never try again I was so unhappy. Oh, Cornie, I go away tomorrow you know. Perhaps, you'll never see me again. Perhaps, the boat will sink and I'll drown. I look terribly drowned.. I have told you, my dear, it rests with you. His happiness or heartbreak. Perhaps, if I see him again, I'll not sail tomorrow. Correct, Cornie, I'll go before he comes. Before it's too late. When you see him, will you tell him I said that to you? Well, did you think I never would.. Oh, is that you, sir? How do you do? Now, I, uh, I'll just put some more coal on the fire. Then we'll all sit down here... I think, Tom, Madame Cavallinni was just leaving as you came in. Leaving? Yes, I'll sleep a little before my last performance. - Come now, you're not going. - Oh please, my performance. Oh, that's alright, it's Martha, and you know it backwards. Miss Armstrong's compliments, Mr. Van Tuyl. And tea is served in the sitting room upstairs. Oh, don't say we're here. We'll come up later. In just a little while, huh? There. Isn't this fine? Oh, I tell you it's a dream come true. What dream? You, here in my armchair in front of my fireplace 'in my study.' A dream, I guess that's all I am. A dream that's lost her way and rest for a minute in your sleeping heart. Tomorrow, you'll wake up, and the little dream's all gone. No don't. Don't go tomorrow. But haven't I told you, I must sing in Rome next month. I don't care. I just can't say goodbye. - Why, then, come with me. - Oh, if I only could. I've got a meeting of the board of charities tomorrow at 11. And Patrick Crowley's funeral at 12. I forgot that you're a clergyman. And I forgot you were golden nightingale. I think it's a very good thing I go away tomorrow. But you're coming back again next year. Why speak about next year? That's so far away. In my profession, one has to think a great deal about things that are far away. That's very foolish. Let me tell you something that I hope you'll remember. Yesterday is a dream that we have forgot. Tomorrow is the hope for some great happiness. It'll never come. Before, behind, just clouds and shadows. Nothing that is real but just this little minute that we call today. But today is so short. You're very young. The time will come I'm sure when you'll be glad to have that little minute. So glad that you'd never think to ask for anything more. Oh, the hours, they fly so fast. Why do you keep the oar over there? Oh, that? I pulled that in the best race Yale ever won. I was number six. We beat Harvard by quarter of a boat length. - I'm so glad you win. - Win, why I.. I'm always talking about myself. Tell me about some of the laughs you used to have. The good times, you know what I mean. The good times. I'm afraid I didn't have very much of that. I was very poor when I was a child, you know. Often, we had hardly anything to eat. And yet, we had so much company. Only, they were all mices. Sometimes, it comes back to me in my dreams. I wake up and feel the pearls around my neck. I cry because it happened so long ago. Poor Rita. Madame Cavallini. Rita, I.. Oh, of all times. I think it comes just in time. Oh, a monkey. How strange, you and the monkey have the same name. Really, Rita, you-you must send that man away. I must meet Adeline, quickly come. He have five children and another one coming next month. Oh, really, Rita. Send that man away. - Give me the money. - Wait.. - Will ten cents do? - Quick, before he goes away. You talk to him as if you'd known him all your life. Why not. We both make the music. - Who is she? - Oh, that's my mother. Oh, she's beautiful. She looks like she holds something in her heart. Something that makes her very happy that no one knows. But perhaps it's a thought that one day she'll have a son like you. There's something here I've been meaning to show you. I keep my mother's little souvenirs in here. - A baby shoe. Who is that? - Oh, it's just my first shoe. It's all worn out. What a sweet child you must've been. Mm-hmm. Well, here's something else. "Curl saved from my son "Thomas Armstrong's first haircut." Oh, she did that because she was very sentimental. Oh, she did that because she loved you so much. Oh, it's so soft. But here's what I really wanted to show you. This was my father's wedding present to my mother. Oh, that's old and so lovely. There's one of my baby pictures in there, I think. - Can I look at that? - Why, of course. - Wh-why, what's the matter? - You're so fat. I think you're the most beautiful baby I ever saw. Mm-hmm. Thank you. Oh, that was for him, my friend, not for you. - Don't you wanna keep it? - Oh, but that's your mother's. - I know. That's why. - She wouldn't like that, huh? Well, of course, I realize how you must feel about excepting presents of jewelry from men but.. ...I think in this case, it's quite alright. - What are you doing? - I make a place for it. - Can you see to put it on? - Yes, I can. I can still remember my mother wearing that locket once and singing Annie Laurie. Annie Laurie? Oh, I know that one. Won't you sing it for me? Oh, I always sing for you. You sing for me, big star. But I can't. I haven't any voice. Oh, of course, I do help Mr. Gates with the choir but.. So you'll sing for Mr. Gates and not for me? Well, ah, just let me clear my throat. ♪ Maxwellton braes.. No, no, that's too high. ♪ Maxwellton braes are bonnies ♪ Where early fa's the dew ♪ And it's there ♪ That Annie Laurie ♪ Gave me ♪ Her promise true ♪ Gave me.. I beg pardon, sir. The vestrymen - Well, get rid of them. - What, sir? I said get rid of 'em. Now, where were we? ♪ Gave me ♪ Her promise true ♪ Which n'er forgot will be ♪ And for bonnie ♪ Annie Laurie ♪ Now, I'd lay ♪ Me down ♪ And dee - It's a song of love. - Yes. But I never knew that until now. - Do you know why? - No. Because I never knew what love was.. ...until now. Then what is love to you? It's finding the woman you wanna live with all your life. The woman who'll show you the right way and follow it with you side by side and shoulder to shoulder. Making all the good things seem a little better. And all the difficult things seem a little less difficult. It's knowing she'll be with you at your journey's end. When you're old and when she's old and you can smile and look into each other's eyes and say "we've done our work together, dear. And we've done it well." That love is for someone, but that's not for me. To me, love is only a little warmth in all this cold. Just a little light in all this darkness. One little minute to lie still in the beloved's arms. One little minute to forget. And that's all. My dear. Rita. Oh, don't come. If you only knew how I love you. - No. - And you love me. Say it. Yes, I love you. This is our little minute that'll never come again. Hold me close. What is that? Well, that's just the choir practicing for tonight. When will you marry me? I never thought the end would come so soon. When, please tell me when? Ask me another time, Tom. No, never ask me. It's just not possible. I've let you speak words that I must never hear. - Oh, my darling. - I've been mad for a moment. I cannot marry you. I must go. But Rita, you can't go like this. But Tom, you are not the man from my world. And perhaps that's why I love you. But we've lived such different lives. I'm sure you could never understand and I don't think that you could forgive. I must tell you, Tom, 'cause we love each other. And you are the first man I ever loved. The first man I ever told. You see, Tom. I was only sixteen when I heard those words for the first time. "I love you." Irgo, his name was. We are together in a serenata. You know, the little company of people that sing under the windows of Greek hotel. At first, he didn't say very much. But every time he looked at me and smiled I just felt that everything in the world was new and wonderful. One evening, he come with me to my room. And there he told me that he loved me. Well, in twelve hours he sold me to an English traveler for fifty lire. My poor Rita. Why, I forgive you from the bottom of my heart. - Oh, can you, Tom? - Why not? It was a long time ago, wasn't it? Oh, is that why you can forgive me because it happened so long ago? Why, of course. You were a child. You just mustn't think about it anymore. You must just remember how afterwards you said to yourself "I may have sinned, but that's all over "and from now on, I'm going to be a good woman. I'm not going to stop until I can be proud of myself." Rita, you have turned your life into a splendid beautiful thing. And now, do you know what we're gonna do? We're going upstairs and announce our engagement to aunt Abigail and Mr. Van Tuyl. - Oh, no. Not now. - Come on. Nonsense, if you don't look out I'll begin to think you're ashamed of me. Come along. But Tom, they probably wouldn't like it if told them now. Now, don't you worry about Aunt Abigail. Oh, I don't worry about her. It surely isn't Mr. Van Tuyl that's worrying you. - Why, he's my oldest friend. - Yes, but he knows. Knows? But surely, Rita he doesn't know anything about you, does he? Oh, I told him a little one night in Paris. You just said that I was the only man you'd ever told because I was the only man that you'd ever loved. Why, I forgot, Tommy. I-it's so long ago, two-three years. But he talked to me very openly about you. He used every possible argument except that one. Why, he never so much as said a word against you. - You can not guess why? - No. That's because... very long ago, you know he was foolish enough to like me. You mean, he wanted you to marry him? Oh, no, no. It was nothing like that, Tom. Let's not talk about this thing anymore. - Why didn't you tell me? - I didn't think you'd like it. Like it? Why shouldn't I? There's nothing to conceal about him, is there? Rita? There isn't anything to conceal? I don't understand what you mean. Rita, tell me there isn't. - Tell me. - Please, no, Tom. Please. Oh! It isn't true. - But you kept back something? - No. How do I know you're not doing it again? Well... if I say yes. - Would you again forgive me? - Then it is true. Oh, no, no. Will you swear it? Oh, yes. Then put your hand on my mother's testament. Now, look at me. Say after me. I swear to you, there's been nothing wrong between Mr. Van Tuyl and me. - Oh, Madonna. - 'Swear it.' There has not been anything wrong between Mr. Van Tuyl and me. My darling, forgive me. I was a brute to doubt you. - Why did you make me swear? - I must've been outta my head. I didn't know what I was saying. Oh, please, please. Oh! Still here? We thought you were.. - Well, what's the matter, Tom? - Oh, nothing, sir. That is, uh... we've something to tell you, sir. - No. - But, Rita, I want him to know. Alright, you tell him alone. I cannot stay. But, surely, you're not afraid. Go away, Tom. Let me speak to him alone, first. - But what.. - Perhaps I should go away. No, no. I want you to hear something. Oh, I don't care then. I want you to know, sir, that.. That Madam Cavallini has been good enough to.. - We're engaged. - Engaged? - Yes, engaged. To be married. - My dear boy. - I congratulate you. - Then it's alright? - You approve? - Ha, of course. I'm flattered to know that Madam Cavallini has chosen one of my friends, one of my countrymen for this great honor. There, you see, Rita. Madam Cavallini thought you might object because of certain things in our past and I was foolish enough to think there might have been something, you know, between you two. I'm not gonna deny a very deep and lasting affection for Madam Cavallini. I beg your pardon. I think, Tom, it is Madam Cavallini whose pardon you should ask. Rita. There's nothing to stop us now. I love you and I want you to be my wife. I can't, Cornie. I love him and I must tell him. Rita, Rita, be quiet. It's all lies what we've told you, Tom. Everything. And till the night I met you, I was... Rita. - You.. - Listen to me for one minute. Please, Tom. He lied for me. He lied for me. Tom. Please go. Both of you. Tom, I'd give everything I have in this world to spare you this. Goodbye. Tom. Tom. Thank you.. ...for having loved me. Senor Van Tuyl. I saw you from down there and I cannot tell you how happy I am. You don't look very happy. She said, she'll not sing tonight. Perhaps you could do something with her. I? Well. Will see if I can stop Niagara dashing over the falls. Oh, Senor Van Tuyl. I cannot tell you how happy I'm to see you. You don't look very happy either. She said, she doesn't want to sing tonight. Maybe you could.. I seem to have heard this conversation before. Well, Rita. - What's this I hear? - I cannot sing. - You should know that. - But, you have an audience. - The song's has gone out of me. - No, that's not true. When you sing, your sorrow becomes their joy. Perhaps... I just cannot. - You have an audience. - Yes, and I have heart too. If you have you'll sing for them. They're here because this is your final appearance. You can't disappoint them. Oh, don't, Cornie. Then get somebody else to sing. Oh, yes, Vardie. I thought you said you had a heart. Ah, but... Vardie is not so bad. Vardie is not Cavallini. I know. I should, maybe I shouldn't let the audience suffer. It has begin, Madam. Well, I have dammed Niagara. Ladies and gentlemen. You've all been so wonderful to me. And I can only say.. ...I love you And you are all that I have to love in this world. Tomorrow I go far away. But perhaps, I'll be back here again with you sometime. In my country.. ...we have a little saying that we tell to our friends when we go away. "May the roses blossom in your heart "until I come to gather them again." Goodbye, my friends. I thank you. 'Goodbye, Madam Cavallini.' Thank you. Gee, I'll never wash this side of my face as long as I live. [indistinct yelling continues] Yeah. That's it. By Jove. Isn't that beautiful? What's it called? - "A dream of love." - Uh-huh, of course it is. What's the matter? Oh, I wake up, that's all. My dream is gone. It would do the senorina good if she eat a little. They've gone to all the trouble to cook your favorite dish. - I'm not hungry. - Oh, mushroom sauce. - It is very good. - Oh! Think how disappointed they'll be. Come along, please. That's a dear. Well, doesn't that salad look good? I'll tell you what. You sit here in this big-arm chair. And... I'll be the butler.. ...with my napkin over my arm. So... and will Madam drink Chianti or champagne? Champagne? Oui. Rosnay Perrault, 52. Not too dry. I can recommend it. Champagne. Hm. I'll open it at once. Mm-m. It smells so good. Hah! And, will Madam taste this and tell me if it is not right? Then I'll send down and.. Oh, please. Please, drink a little. You really need it. You like spaghetti, eh? I bet my life. Oh, thanks, thanks. That's enough. Well.. Are you going to allow me to starve? What did you say? I can't eat until my hostess does. Ah, it's a trick you play, eh? No, no, no. On my word. I'm really hungry. I'll then, just because I'm so polite. Oh, I know. A toast. To the splendors of the days that are to come. I don't drink to what I know will be. But to a dream. It comes to every woman once. And it came to me at last. A whim. The man I love beside me. And a little child. A dream that I'll never dream again. Rita, I want you to listen to a plan. Suppose you go to Mille fleurs. And in the Spring I'll join you there. Remember May time in Mille fleurs? 'With the lilacs under your window.' 'And the lime trees by the fountain.' Oh, no, no. It's impossible. You don't understand. I can't go back to that old life anymore. Forgive me, my dear. I didn't mean to hurt you. Hurt me? You... no. Oh, but in this last few weeks I've learnt something new and beautiful. The goodness of the world. It showed me for the first time to myself. And, oh! What is it I see? I'm proud of you. Oh, but, Cornie. What have I done at all? We should go home. What have I done? 'Senorina, excuse me.' But the poor man. He's downstairs. He break my heart. - Who, Tom? - Yes, he give me this for you. "I must see you. It's life or death." What are you going to do? - I'll say no. - No, you mustn't. Don't send that boy away with a memory of this afternoon. - But, not tonight... - This very minute. Keep him down until after I've gone then bring him up here. You're not going? Yes. He mustn't find me here. Oh, don't leave me, Cornie. I'm afraid. Afraid? When you can help him? I thought you loved him, Rita. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. And Rita, do you forgive me? - For what? - For everything. O-oh! My darling. - Beautiful. - My friend. I'll hear you singing in my heart forever. Then I thank you from the bottom of my soul. Come in. You... you, you want to see me? Yes. Well? Oh, you're cold, eh? Come and warm yourself. You walked in the snow, haven't you? Yes, I've been walking. I think I got as far as Trinity. Oh, but why did you come out tonight without your big coat? My coat, I suppose I forgot to put it on. I was thinking about something else. About you. Oh, I walked and walked. And as I was walking along a woman spoke to me. And when I looked down at her painted lips my head swam. It was you. You were dreaming, Tom. I heard you crying as I ran away. I ran and ran, I don't know where until I came to some lights and people. A little beggar held up her hand. And when I gave her a penny, she thanked me with your voice. Oh, I, I don't want you to talk this way, Tom. And I saw you walking by me in the streets and.. And looking at me out of windows. Hundreds of different women. But everyone was you. 'Then it began snowing and I..' I thanked God 'cause I knew that would blotch you from my sight. But, no. Each snowflake was a tiny face. Your face. Thousands and millions of you swirling in the glare of the gaslight on the corner. And not one spoke. You all just looked at me. Imploringly. And suddenly I knew that you were begging me to save you. To save you before it was too late. And I cried out to you that I would. Then you smiled and.. ...disappeared. And I came here through the storm. Why don't you understand? Why did you come? To save you, dear. Listen. At midnight, I must lead my clergy through the streets. You know, my plan to gather in the vagrants for the new year service. And tomorrow, you go away. So I must talk to you now. I must make you feel what I feel. Why, I must. If you only knew how. Rita. I thought it was just chance that brought us together. That we were meant to love each other as man and woman. But tonight the truth came to me. I know now that it was just part of the divine plan that we met. That our paths cross. I'm a minister of God's word Rita.. ...and you're a human being who must be saved. Do you know you're standing on the brink of life and death? - You must choose between them. - Yes-yes, another time. No, not another time. Tonight, this very minute. Now. You're so kind to think of me so much after all the trouble I bring you. And I thank you but it's alright. You can forget me now. Your work is done. What do you mean? You see, before I met you I didn't know much, what a woman's life should be. But I know now.. ...and I learned it from you. I can never go back to my old life again. It'll be all different. And I only hope that God will help me. Rita, God will help you. He'll hear you. We'll pray to him to hear you. Come here. Kneel down. There... that's right. Now, give me your hand. Oh but pray, Tom. Why don't you pray? Oh, why do you look at me that way? Because I love you. I've been lying to myself. Don't you see lying to myself? I thought I came here to save you, but I didn't. I came here because I'm a man. and I want you more than anything else in the world. Tom, please. Oh, Tom. I have no strength to fight against you. But Tom, the kind of woman I'll always be is for you to decide here, now. Don't treat me like the others have. You're the man that God sent to help the world. Why don't you help me? I need you. Go away. Go away, Tom. My heart will go with you always. But I don't care. If you will only let me keep my soul. Goodnight. My very best wishes for the coming year. Alright. Goodnight. Goodbye. And so, that's how I remember her. Standing there, praying. A few years later, I married Susan Van Tuyl your grandmother. A fine woman. She understood the world and loved it too. She made my life a very happy one. Oh but, Madame Cavallini didn't you ever hear of her again? Not until tonight. Oh, here it is. "Madame Cavallini, once famous opera singer... dies "at the Holy Cross Convent in Geneva. "Madame Cavallini was born "in Naples May 5th, 18 hundred and..." Don't tell me how old she was, my boy. Because tonight, I'm only 28. Oh, I'm sorry. I spoke like a fool before. I know now how you must've loved her. Because that's the way I love Lucille. Still perhaps, you're right. Maybe, we have been in too much of a hurry. Perhaps, we ought to take a little time to think it over. Don't be an idiot, Harry. If you love her and she loves you don't let your mother or anybody else in the world come between you. Don't lose it my boy. It's the greatest thing in the world. Romance.
