When you see that, I certainly feel pity for Diana because she was getting involved in a big game that she didn't know half the details of at that stage. [ Camera shutters clicking ] Diana had no idea what she was stepping into. Part of the Royal duty was traveling the world. Diana was new to this and nervous.

FINCHER: When she does a walkabout, it's sort of staying back from the crowd, so she'll walk over to the crowd, but she'll... there'll be a gap. She won't go right up to the barrier and reach in. She'll stand back and she'll extend her arm out and take some flowers, but you won't see her putting her arm in and touching people or giving a child a hug. It would be very "I'm here, and you're there." [ David Bowie's "Rebel Rebel" plays ] With Diana, it was completely different. If there was a small child with some flowers, Diana would go down low to the child's level. You wouldn't see that with other members of the Royal family. ♪ Rebel, rebel, you tore your dress ♪ It hadn't happened like this before. She was so tactile with them.

They would all stand there, look their way, nod and smile, and then walk out the room, but not Diana. She would get involved. She would take part in it. WOMAN: Diana!

And I got to the office, and the office driver I met spat on the floor and made me feel terrible. But the editor was delighted. The editor was Kelvin MacKenzie. GREENSLADE: He actually welcomed Arthur, putting his arms around him, and he was determined that it would go on the front page. FOLKENFLIK: He publishes the first picture of "Bahama Mama" and gets some pushback from Buckingham Palace, and then there's essentially a "[bleep] you" the next day, where he says, "No, we're gonna do it again."

I don't think he's in love with her. I don't think it's the great love match. To begin with, it was a marriage of convenience. They're much, much happier now because she's come to grips with the job. I still don't think he's in love with her, but he respects her, and she is the only woman in his life. BRADFORD: Well, I don't think it was a tremendous lot of fun for Diana, actually. I don't think she saw very much of Prince Charles... you know, wasn't there for her. The fairy tale was a bit wobbly. FINCHER: There was a lot of separation. She'd be in London. Often he was down at Highgrove.

He is used to concealing his emotions. Emotions just get him into trouble. She wasn't stiff‐upper‐lippy at all, and that was the royal way. That wasn't Diana.

And that syndrome, a lot of the time, would come in because they didn't feel they were going to live up to their parents' expectations of being a great dancer or they didn't fit and they weren't going to get into a company, so then they would persecute themselves.

She wouldn't need it anymore. And I think as she gathered steam in her own right and suddenly started to see what she could achieve and the role became more defined, her life became more defined. ♪♪ FINCHER: The stories were abound that Charles and Camilla were back together. Diana decided that she was going to confront Camilla. And she did. In history, royal people went around planting commemorative trees or launching ships or things like that. But the Princess has taken up the cause of the deaf, of handicapped children, and that, perhaps, is something new to many people that royal people should concern themselves in this way. [ Camera shutter clicking ] PARRY: Diana did become very gripped very quickly by causes. She always said to me that she thought of herself as an outsider, that these people were also outsiders. And she had a bond with them. The idea that Diana was an outsider is, for me, quite hard to reconcile because she was everything that is the establishment, in some ways, but, emotionally, she felt that she was an outsider, and that's what attracted her to a range of organizations where people were on the wrong side, as it were. WHITE: She resonated with suffering. She herself had scar tissue and traumas growing up. She was introverted and lonely, had insecurities. So, the accumulation of this, even after marrying the Prince and becoming Princess Diana, all of that was combining to something quite powerful, which was this very raw, high emotional intelligence, social intelligence. I would call it "trauma intelligence." PRINCESS DIANA: I'm learning how they cope and how they deal with the outside world who don't always want to know about them, perhaps. As Diana grew into her role, she became patron of more and more charities... things like addiction, homelessness, HIV, of course. We are going to go on now with AIDS, because, apparently, a lot of health professionals are now worried about their own chance of getting AIDS. One in four would refuse to treat AIDS patients if given a choice. We forget, because HIV is now a treatable disease, that in those days, it was a death sentence. I have lost a dozen friends already in the last year and a half, two years. I think in terms of the gay community, anybody who's got any brains is nervous and scared. SPENCER: She had friends who were gay who had either been infected by the virus or who somebody special to them had been, and this opened her eyes to the reality of it all.

CONNELLY: It got on the front page of every newspaper in England. It got in the glossy section of every magazine in Europe. It changed the conversation. It did move the needle, because she was leveraging her celebrity on behalf of something that she cared about. VARGAS: It sent an enormous message. They see that image of the most famous woman in the world [Gasps] doing that. It was extraordinary. And I think she knew exactly what she was doing. SPENCER: It was an incredibly powerful act. She was not really a gloves person. She was very about human contact and what really mattered. And what really mattered that day was to get across a very clear message that, you know, "I'm gonna touch this gentleman, and you can all exist in a community with people who are suffering and we must help them.

She was pried upon, and she needed some privacy, and she didn't get a lot of privacy. COLTHURST: That's a pretty vulnerable place to be. It's like discovering, you know, your room's been tapped. She was concerned that somebody was listening within Kensington Palace switchboard, so that was her worry. And we started using scramblers. You switched it on, and it would garble the message. We would often get a minute of chat on the scramblers, which the opposition would hear as "Mrr‐mrr‐mrr." It was garbled speech. And then the line would be cut. That was pretty sobering. She was just getting slightly paranoid about the whole thing... quite rightly so when you've got so much going on around you. COLTHURST: She knew there was gonna be an explosion.

COLTHURST: He was already doing a biog on her. Diana said maybe she should help with Morton and the book. She wasn't prepared to rely on people like me to tell her story, or her friends or tabloid reporters. She wanted to speak to the nation herself. COLTHURST: I said, "Well, you can't be interviewed by him, or you'll be in a vulnerable position. Think very long and hard about what you really want to do and make sure that you don't do any damage to the organization that your boys will end up as part of. It was a top‐secret project of Diana's. Charles had no clue about this... none. It was a very deliberate procedure. Morton would figure out what he wanted. He would write the questions. He would give them to James Colthurst. I would receive the questions. I turned up, and she grabbed all the questions out of my hand and just said, "It's just quicker if I read them and answer them there and then." And she opened up. And I'd go back, and then I'd hand over the tape. I think she was just relieved that she was gonna be heard for the first time and perhaps understood. FOREMAN: When Princess Diana married Prince Charles, she was expected to be involved, but she wasn't expected to be independent, and that is the key difference. Just before the Andrew Morton book was coming out, she started to be quite edgy and distressed. She knew the world was about to fall in on her head. GREENSLADE: She was eager to take part in trying to control her own narrative, and it blew up in her face. ♪♪ BEDELL SMITH: The first excerpt of the book occurred in June of 1992. Charles and Diana were at Highgrove for the weekend, and they were entertaining Charles' interior designer, Robert Kahn, who was sitting at the breakfast table, and somebody delivered a fax which had the first installment of this book and gave it to Charles. And Robert Kahn watched him reading this and saw this look of alarm on Charles' face that this was going to be in the Sunday Times that day. And it rocked the Royal family.

Well, I've always liked Diana very much... you know, her honesty and all the things she had to go through. I think Diana should be queen. She's very much... very much a contemporary woman and I think we all admire her. GREENSLADE: She was eager to take part in trying to control her own narrative, and she saw the Morton book as a way of doing just that, and it blew up in her face. CAGLE: She was very good, at times, dealing with the media, sometimes manipulating the media, but once you've made your life a commodity, you really don't have any control over it. CONNELLY: All of a sudden, two surreptitiously recorded phone conversations come to light. BEDELL SMITH: It was New Year's Eve, and Diana and her then lover, James Gilbey, were having a phone conversation. I don't sense that it was a terribly serious relationship, but the tenor of the conversation was one that transmitted intimacy... the use of nicknames like "Squidgy." Unbeknownst to James Gilbey and Diana, that telephone call had been tapped.

FOLKENFLIK: Kelvin MacKenzie was editor of The Sun, and, in some ways, he was the prefect embodiment of what a tabloid editor should be. He was tough He was over the top. The fact that it may involve people's lives being upended... not his problem. The single word that would describe him would be "iconoclast." There have been various other epithets ever since. I frankly believe you're hostile to the press and you're hostile to ordinary people knowing the truth about what goes on in public life. Well, I have to say that your somewhat offensive and aggressive manner does not help us in coming down on your side. Apart from MP's, I don't know anybody who's ever worried about the press. What they do worry about is what's going on in high places, and they want papers like The Sun to expose them. Both sets of tapes were horribly uncomfortable, really. LACEY: The release of those tapes was... the most dreadful breach of press protocol and basic morality and decency. GREENSLADE: This was to transform how everyone would be treated... all celebrities. The level of intrusion was crafted during the Diana years. CONNELLY: This was like a dam on a river. You know, this was something that controlled a huge amount of power. Bits and pieces began to appear in Australian media. REPORTER: An Australian magazine has published what it alleges is an explicit telephone call between Prince Charles... An Australian magazine tonight published what it claims is the uncensored transcript... There were always these questions of how it emerged there. Who leaked those tapes? REPORTER: The Australian magazine New Idea won't say how it got the tape but believes it is authentic. The magazine is owned by Rupert Murdoch, whose British newspapers include The Times and The Sun. The Sun published a fresh scandal, this time involving Diana. Mr. Murdoch today denied he'd known of the decision to publish. The paper then invited the whole country to listen in any telephone. MAN: Listen to the conversation and judge for yourself. What did your proprietor, or whoever engaged you... Yes. Mr. Murdoch hired me, yes. Rupert Murdoch plays a tremendous amount of interest in what happens in this country. Has Mr. Murdoch ever discussed with you the paper's policy towards the monarchy and Royal family? Diana was a pawn in a larger chess game. It was Murdoch and The Sun versus the Royal family. FOLKENFLIK: You can't tell the story of the evolution of the media and journalism in the English‐speaking world without focusing on Rupert Murdoch. GREENSLADE: Rupert Murdoch buying the News of the World in '68 and then The Sun in 1969 was a major turning point in the history of British newspapers. MAN: One more link in the vast chain of a rapidly expanding empire. GREENSLADE: As an Australian, he had less of an affection for the Royal family... didn't see the point of them. MURDOCH: You would never really open up to society until you tackle this class system, and it was very hard to see how you would tackle it with the Royal family there. He saw them as fodder. I mean, they provided an unbelievable amount of grist for his publication. GREENSLADE: Previously, editors had decided what should go into their newspapers by asserting their own values, their own ethics, their own standards. Murdoch came along and said, "I'm not interested in that. What I want is simply to give the people what they want. How will I find that out? 1970... let's put a naked girl into the newspaper. Is that popular? Yes, it is. Right. That was the foundation, the birth, of what became known as the Page 3 girl. The Page 3 girls of The Sun was a perfect example of a newspaper that demanded to be, in some ways, taken seriously, nonetheless reducing women to body parts. Diana was equally reduced to her looks, to her figure. Rupert Murdoch decided, "This is one of the great narratives we're gonna ride, and we're gonna ride this for years." Could they find a way to get her in a bathing suit? If they saw the royal bum, would that go on the pages? ♪♪ Princess Diana was like fresh meat. GREENSLADE: "Give the people what they want." It was as simple as that. FOREMAN: The more beautiful she became, the more people really liked to try to humiliate her. The British public was certainly getting very disturbed by what Diana was being put through, but they still bought the magazines. They still bought the newspapers. After a while, they forgot that this was a real person, and they just saw her as a commodity. The revolution begins here... MSNBC. FOLKENFLIK: There was this explosion of cable channels. She was like a catalyst for that industry. The Princess has blabbed to the tabs.

ETHERINGTON‐SMITH: You can't protect someone all the time, you know? I mean, you just can't. You never know when they're going to pop up. Close‐protection officers are one thing, but paparazzi on, you know, really fast motorbikes are something else. ♪♪ [ Siren wailing ] ♪♪ [ Siren wailing ] EDWARDS: It was about 12:30 at night, and I get a call from the office saying Diana had a car crash in Paris.

He said, "Well, ask Colin to get up, sit on the end of the bed, and listen to me." He said, "Colin, your boss is injured. She's had a road accident." And I said, "Thank you very much. Can you tell me the injuries?" And he said, "No. I think an arm, leg, and a few other cuts and bruises." That's... If you read the case, that's what happened. They thought she was injured.

We don't know with what or... but we do know what the consequence was, and that was that the car rolled over, ended up on its roof. Speculation is growing that [Clears throat] it will be grim news.

And I could see very quickly that people were on the roof, quite a distance away, and may not have yet pinpointed the room that we were in. Meanwhile, I was discussing to get some blankets to put up to the windows, which we did, so the press couldn't see in. SPENCER: I was living in South Africa at the time, and my four kids lived with me. They were very young. I said to the kids, "I'm afraid Aunt Diana's died." Eliza...

I said, "This is how it ends," you know? This terrible story of manipulation and gross unkindness.

And the newspapers were terrified, and so I believe there was a calculated push by the tabloid newspapers to re‐direct public anger away from them and towards the monarchy. GREENSLADE: The main attitude was, "It wasn't us. It wasn't our fault. The driver was drunk, and it's all down to him." They quickly realized attack is always better than defense in terms of how newspapers organize themselves, so they were the first to highlight that the Queen had been slow to react in a way that they thought was appropriate.

What the world wanted was for the Queen and the Royal family to come rushing down to London. There was this strange feeling that the Queen could act as some sort of balm, the consoling mother, that if she were in London, everybody would feel better. JENNINGS: A great many people have waited this week with enormous anticipation for the Royal family to become engaged. And the Queen came back yesterday.

I don't think she ever understood why her genuinely good intentions were sneered at by the media, why there appeared to be a permanent quest on their behalf to bring her down. It is baffling.

She was the biggest star, and then that star went out. And so now when we look at William and Harry, you know, we look at them with a new feeling. Now they weren't just the Royal family.
