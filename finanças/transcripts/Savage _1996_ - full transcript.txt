- Mm, so good. What kind of perfume are you wearing? - It's an expensive French import, it's called soap and water. Drives men crazy. - You bad. - Daddy, wanna play soldier? Sergeant Steel is my favorite. - Come here. - Daddy! I wanna play... Murphy... ugh. - Why don't you play something else? You wanna play cards, do a puzzle? - No, that's boring. - What about Go Fish? - No, you can be Sergeant Steel. - Ah you're winning, bad... Come back. You won. - What? What are you smiling about? - I guess I feel lucky. - Lucky in love? - Very lucky in love. - How's that for romantic? - Mommy, I can't see my food. - I'll get some candles, honey can you check the fuse? - Okay. - I'll be right back Jimmy. - Noooooooo. - Jimmy! - Daddy! - Jimmm! - Ow! Oww! - No! - Nooooo! - This is nothing like Cuckoo's Nest, you'll be fine... The first thing you need to know about night duty is that your most important reference guide is a TV guide. Yea, right, no kidding. - Hey, hey, excuse me, sir, sir. - Mr., let's get you back in bed we can't have you roaming the hall. - It's planted in everyones' teeth, yes they do, I know it! Yes, they do! - That's alright Mr., we'll just get you back in bed. Come on. - Don't, I'm telling you. - It's ok. - They're here, they're every where. - It'll be gone in the morning. You calm down, calm down. It's ok, it's ok. - What's wrong now? He's been here for two years, total un-functional, he never says a thing. Hardly ever gets out of bed. - What happened to him? - His wife and child were killed. House burned down. - Did he do it? - They don't know - Sound... Wretch... like meee - Jim! - Hello, security? There's been a breakout in section three. What code? I don't know, I'm new here. I don't know if he's dangerous. He could be. Could you just hurry please? - I love you. - I love you too, sweetheart. Alex, come to me. Alex... Come to me Alex. Alex... Alex! Come to me. Alex, please come to me. - Leaves... healing leaves. Charlie. Charlie - Vengeance shall be mine. - Sayeth the lord. - For there is an evil among us. - And God with His hand smote my enemies with righteous vengeance! - What do you want! - Charlie? - Alex? Please! Find the man who did this to us before he does it to millions of others. - Whoever did this to us... I swear I'll kill them. Kill me! - Basket case, you don't even know who I am, do you? Do you! - Fear not! - For I will be with you... - We'll be blind but then we'll see! - And there were men who broke his heart. - And they were the children. - Yes, come to papa. - Hey! Quit it! Oh, cut it out. - Yesss - Oh yea? Take that! - Shit! Son of a...! Oh God. Shit! We hit somebody. - What the hell do you mean we hit somebody? - That guy was like fricking Tarzan. - Ah shit! - Tarzan. - Great, we hit fucking Tarzan. Shit! Hey Tarzan! Umgawah! - Hey I'm not kidding you man, we hit somebody! - Yea, we hit somebody... Oh my God! You're right man. Tarzan the apeshit man. Hey you alright? Great a 5150, we'll be in psycho central all night long. - I hate that fucking place! - Alright come on man, get up. Let's go Sasquatch, I don't have all night. Ahhh! Christ this guy needs a hose down. Smells like a goat! You know what, you hit him, you tag him, I'll log him in. Alright, come on. Come on goat boy, let's go. C'mon! - Hey! What the hell. Come on! What are you doing? - What? - Yea, hi, it's me. - Oh yea, Jesus, not another deadbeat. I know, I know but he fits the profile. - I mean it's Titan, right? - Right. See you there. - Is this part of the game? Come here! C'mon, get back into bed. - Sorry. It's business. Give me your number, ok? - Nobody goes until I'm finished. - Let go. - Shut up! Jesus. - If you're here when I get back I'll kill you. You understand? Don't bleed on my sheets. - That's not what happened, see, I was just... - Hey Carter! Have I got one for you. - Forget it, I'm off. - Oh, no, no, Carter, duty first. Now myself and my partner are on street duty... which means the sooner we are back on said street the safer it will be for the inhabitants of this fine yet dull community. Which means your duty is to cut down the amount of time we spend here. Of course to monitor and supply the paper cups by that water cooler, thereby in your own minute way to keep the streets safe. - Nice but I am off. - Oh but did I mention this guy is a 5150 which means he has to be tended to right away. Goat boy. - Hey Halliday, only reason you're on the street and I'm not is because you were a jock. I'll be it in a minute way. - Oh yea really. - Sit down! Ok, don't. Name. Do you know where you are right now? When was the last time you ate? Are you thirsty? Do you want some? Go ahead. I didn't touch it. That's my dog, uh, my dog actually died. Do you have a dog? Oh god! Here, here, here. Ok. I'm gonna bandage you up and then I'm gonna send you over to county. - Let's go. What is it this time Ms. Beloc. Find another juicehead in the ditch somewhere? That's five this year alone. - If you like the money don't bitch about the job. Beloc, Marie. Wallace, Edgar. Poe, Allen. Clearance one, chairman suite. Positive voice recognition, thank you. - So Edgar, how is life? - Call me Eddy, call me Wallace, but don't call me Edgar. How's life? Life is well and truly fucked. I have worked for some seriously warped individuals in my time but this nut job takes the cake. - Mr. Burroughs know you feel this way about him? - I don't give a rusty fuck what Mr. Burroughs knows. Shit, I used to jack up little punks like that in high school for their lunch money. This is an un-programmed stop. You're late. - I'm sorry sir, we came as soon as we got the alert. - Mr. Burroughs we're going to be even later if you don't turn the elevator back on. Motion restored, proceeding to chairman suite. - Dang! You think he heard me? - What do you think. - Well? - It's like the other four, a man was found in the desert, no clothes, no ID. Right now he's being held at the county holding facility. - Go ahead. - I'll send a man. - No, no, you send a team. What! - On an operational level... it doesn't make sense to send three professionals to handle another basket case. If you don't mind. - Actually. I do mind. You see I pay for them. Therefore I get to waste them. If that's alright with you Mr. Wallace. Is that alright? Yes, sir. - Hey! - Hey no, I'm just gonna drain the lizard, man. Hey. Welcome to the gerbil cage big guy. My name's Shazam man, because I like to fly. You know, fly? Get ready for the holding block. - Yea. Hey you like to fly, man? Hey what are you on, man? Open it up. Like acid or shrooms? Or something better? Me first, dump these guys off like it's the YMCA... Caption's orders... fine! Like it's one more thing that I have to do. Put these guys in these three beds, they'll be fine till the morning. Me? I'm gonna be up all night. C'mon let's go. If the warden didn't have me around... - Hey, welcome to the gerbil cage man, my name's Shazam, I like to fly. This guy wants to kiss me. - No man! - You the nature boy? 6'1", long hair, 180 pounds. - That's him, we'll see if we can get him up. - Look at that, get the monkey. Kill that fucker! C'mon! Kill that fucking man! Give me something! Give me something! - Here. Come on down! - I got him! Open the holding cell now! - PCP, got it. - Hey! What the hell happened here? - Gerbils ate each other. - Escaped prisoner. Patching into the county video system now. - He was like a gorilla or something, he tore the bars right out of the walls. - How does one man? - No, no, he's not a man. He's savage. - What the fuck is a savage, who is this guy? - Up until this point he was my worst nightmare, now he's your worst nightmare too. - I don't have nightmares. Now what do I tell the troops about this savage where's he going, and what kinda weapons he's carrying. - He's coming here. And as far as weapons are concerned, he is the weapon. - C'mon! Give me my boy. Let it go. Play gangster? - No, no, no, yes! - I'm ready to fax. - No, no, wait, wait. They would have wanted him to fit in, he'll have cut his hair. Sit. Ms. Beloc, your blouse is undone. Did you get dressed in a hurry? - Yes, I did. - Well button up. - Let's go. What's next is to move beyond virtual reality... you see the silicon language limits virtual reality to an internal experience, exploring our fantasies but within someone else's idea of a perfect environment. Virtual reality is the beginning of a whole new concept. - Mr. Burroughs is experimenting with a variety of different drives, worth protecting the revolutionary virtual reality machines. - But it's random, you can't control it, you're more than just a player, you're god. - Now consumers quickly fell in love with these enormously entertaining Titan games. However teams of highly skilled engineers and scientists have failed to duplicate the technology. The reclusive billionaire is closely associated with Titan plaza where Burroughs spends most of his waking hours. - The plain of the immortal.. Kill me! - Why me? Why my family? - You will own a master of all you survey and the universe bends to your every will. - Is your memory maxed out? I know mine is. Do you know where to go for more megabytes than you've ever dreamed of? I do. Follow me to the electronic kitchen, we can fulfill your every need. Staffed by computer wizards just like me. The electronic kitchen is your one stop shopping spot for a ton of totally tantalizing technology. Join us... and surf the net at the electronic... Hey you! Hold it right there! .at the electronic kitchen 2001 university avenue. Stop police! - See why we're the best and the biggest. - Cops spotted at Market Street. - Wallace, Wallace, turn on your optic feed. - Ok, 3324 Street. - Oh, you too. - Ok. Titan's Illegal Entry the game that lets you be a cat burglar, operative, industrial spy or an assassin. Welcome to Titan's Illegal Entry the game that lets you be a cat burglar, operative... - Evening dude, may I help you find something? - Welcome to Titan's illegal entry the game that lets you be a cat burglar, operative, industrial spy or an assassin. Welcome to Titan's illegal entry the game that lets you be a cat burglar, operative, industrial spy or an assassin. Find the machine, destroy the machine. Save the world, save mankind. Destroy the machine, save the world, save mankind. Find the machine, destroy the machine, save the world, save mankind. Find the machine. - Go get him. - Go ahead man, help yourself man. Go ahead, go ahead, just fine, yea, yea, yea, that's good, that's good. Yea, yea, yea. - Wallace! What's going on? - Oh men, let's keep your eyes open. - Ok, alright, come on, come on. - Come on. - We got a fuckin' mess. Wipe out all police leads I don't want this traced back to Titan. - ...Did you get a good look at the guy who did all this? - You bet I did, I never seen anything like that, I mean look at this guy. - All clear. - Veronica, you're such an embarrassment the way you slapped that guy's butt. - What? All the guys do it to each other when they score a goal. - Yea well that guy didn't score a goal. - Yea well he was trying. Come on, Megan, just one drink with these guys... come on it's not gonna do any harm. - These guys are useless, besides I mean why do we need men to have a good time... They either fuck you or fuck you over and either way they get to hold you down. - Hold you down, now you are talking! Hunk hunt, beef quest, come on this could be your lucky night. I mean the fabled he could just show up, you could get the man of your dreams tonight. This is nuts. - What's nuts? Where are you going? Nicky, slow down! Will you wait? Dweeb alert, dweeb alert, dweeb alert. - What's the big smiles for? What are you looking at? Don't blow a gasket boys. ID? I... D.... Hey, Thor. Thor buy. "Sprechen zi English?" Oh this place is insane. (Disconcerting sounds) - Skeletor movement... take me out. - Hey. Woah! Woah! Woah.... Woah. What are you doing here? You're supposed to be in county. - Nicky. Nicky! - Watch here, watch here. Move, move! - Get off me. - Don't be a mess while somebody's trying to kill us... it's like trying to... - Yes. - Hey, hey, hey! - What, what, what! - Code 3. - No shit? - No shit. - Rock and roll! - Don't you see it! - Don't you see him! - Oh please Mr. Savage, don't hurt me. - Poe, do you hear me? Kill him now! - University Street looks like... - That's it I'm a dead man - Paramedics sort through the carnage... -He'll be coming here next. - Go on what are you waiting for? Make your move Ms. Beloc. We both know you're too smart to just stick around and wait for the proverbial shoe to drop. Tell you what, you just go to the bathroom... we'll both pretend you're coming back. - Relax, I never leave home without it. - Ok, a atypically candid admission. I'm a fan, you're a master, this guy's a master and I've got the best seat in the house. - This is not a game! Are you out of your mind? In my games if you're very very good, if you're very very good you should always be in control but this is out of hand. I was so close, three or four months. -Wait a minute, wait a minute. - I would have had it, just two or three months. - I don't want to overstep my boundaries here so maybe if we just talk this out we can get a new perspective. - Talk this... what are you thinking! This isn't therapy! - This may sound simplistic but you knew a man would try to stop you from solving X, that's why you hired us. You say you need three or four months to crack this. The fact that he's here now is an indication that you're closer to your solution than you might think. Or at least that's what they think. - The fuck happened in that bar! - Mr. Burroughs wants his facility locked up airtight. - Let's go! - Yes, sir! - There are a dozen men in the lobby. - Wait a minute this guy looks familiar. Jesus Christ! It's the guy from the ranch. - Yes, you idiot! That's why you should have finished him off! Now they're using his rage as a perfect tool for my destruction. Wait, wait, wait, wait a second maybe not so perfect who is that? - Who? - The woman! Who's the woman? - It'll be on the police report. - Mr. Wallace you may be about to start earning your Christmas bonus you keep him away for a few hours. Access granted. - Got it. Nicole Carter. She's a cop. - What's so special about her? - I don't know. But a savage is supposed to be obsessed with his quest, his calling. He shouldn't possess any emotions except for bloodlust and anger. But, but, he, he saved this woman, therefore he must care for her. Which makes him vulnerable. He's vulnerable. Wallace here, yea, ok out. Morning Edgar. - Sir she's just no leaving the station, if you don't mind I'd like to handle this personally. - Fine do it. - Aw I think you hurt the big ape's feelings. - Please. Please! Who is it? Who is it? - Check it out. Alright just gonna loosen the ends here. - If you had to break into this place, would you hack your way through? - I could hack my way through any code in high school I'm a real student of cryptology used to break into NSA files, missile codes, fun stuff - Precocious. Please. - May I? - Please - Monitor out on level six. -Cro-magnon? - Yes, cro-magnon. Our savage forefathers fifty-thousand years ago. You know you continue to impress me, Ms. Beloc. - I don't understand. This is not cro-magnon. - Oh it absolutely is, I was a member of the original expedition that found it. The only surviving member as a matter of fact. The others met with a little accident on the way home. - Down there. - Dent, Lester. Clearance two. - And these pictographs? - Symbol cryptography! - Like the fraternal crypt used by the Rosicrucians and Freemasons. - Yes, only its binary. The cryptographs translate to key numbers which translate to cyber text. - Bur cro-magnon? - Eden Ms. Beloc, mythical Eden. - All the earth's early cultures... Hebrew, Phoenician, Greek, Goth, Druid, Sioux Indian, Astic, Scandinavian. They all share the legend of an extraordinary civilization unsurpassed in spiritual and creative genius... Which vanished in a cataclysm, a deluge if you will. - But that's myth. - Why would every culture come up with the same myth? Pyramids continents apart in Egypt and South American they bear identical architectural features. You don't honestly believe that a primitive people could construct technological marvels like Easter Island and Stone Henge out of sheer primitive inspiration, do you consider this? Geologists estimate that the end of the last ice age the one that parted the straights of Gibraltar and filled the mediterranean basin at around the same time as Plato and Herodotus approximated the disappearance of Atlantis. Another coincidence? Read the data. The virtual reality that Titan sells is nothing but a crude version of this technology. Don't you see? The ancient ones created a virtual universe an infinite paradise in cyberspace but they had to have food and they needed labor. So they took the apes down from the trees our ancestors. They trained them. We are not the children of gods, Ms. Beloc. We are the offspring of apes. I'm running out of time. - What happened to them? With all their technology surely they could have survived the cataclysm. Well the cataclysm didn't annihilate them it merely erased their fingerprints, proof of their existence. You see they'd reached such a level of sophistication that they left the flesh behind. They simply transferred their essence into cyber space. The way we digitize sound and light, they digitize matter. Now they exist in a cyber universe, immortal but powerless in this world. Which is why they sent the savage to keep me from deciphering the key to immortality. Don't you see? It's all about scaring the apes, us, into sheer ignorance. You remember your bible? Keep your hands off the fruit. Keep your hands off the fruit of the tree of knowledge. God messing with the men who dared to erect the tower of Babel Its amazingly consistent, isn't it? Knowledge is power. And the key to immortality is the ultimate power. - But why, why would they want to corner the market on immortality? A cyber universe... - Ms. Beloc, enough please. The end of our discourse we need to pursue your solution now. - Well the first thing we should consider is all the binary combinations that you ran through the computer about the time that the savage appeared. - Good. - Just one question. - What? If I crack this... Am I gonna have a little accident too? - Yes! Force entry zone B. - Abort! - Abort! - Four down, three to go, Mr. Rose... can you feed? - Reese! - What? - My name. - Reese? Good. - He's in the building. - What! He's in the building. Finish up! Looking for me? You are here to kill me, right? Well you know we better hurry up to deliver our speeches. You know, my diabolical plans, your determination to keep me from succeeding. Blah, blah, blah. You know what? I say the hell with it. It's the 90's let's watch TV. Mr. Wallace. Can you hear me? - Yea, I can hear you. - Let her go. - Oh I will. Tomorrow, maybe the day after until then you just keep your distance. Oh go on, you can kill me, you can kill me, go on. But you'll be killing her too, just the way you were responsible for the death of your wife and child. You know we made you a generous offer on your ranch, a very, very generous offer. You want, you want this woman's blood on your hands too? Is that what you want? Hmm? Choose. At you. Alright then. Let's just play a little game, shall we? I'm going to count to three and if you're still here... then Mr. Wallace will just... Well... You know. Ready? One... Two... Three... Wallace. We're on. - To Nick, love dad. That's nice. How about a little wager? - Sure... How about $500? - Let's make it a grand you punk. I wouldn't move if I were you. If I knick your carotid artery you'll be dead. - Missed sucker. - Go to hell! - See you around. I'm going back to type. Keep an eye on her. - What is taking Wallace so long? - How did they... -Turn a simple rancher into a savage? The brain is a computer Ms. Beloc it operates on electrical impulses. You press the right buttons, you tap the original hard drive the cro-magnon programs, the lizard algorithms and voila. Access the beast within. - Beast within? Sounds good. - Shh. Go. - Get back! Get back! Where is he? - I go, I go. You see him? See him? - Fuck this! The fucking... - What took you so long! Did you set the detonator? Come on! - No more nightmare. No! Wait. Wait! Where are you going? Are you going to Titan? Will you stop for one second? - I have no time. - Wait. What the hell is going on? Who are you! - I gotta go before... - You gotta go before what! It's me, it's me! Look I've seen you in action god knows what you are. I'm not here to bust you, I'm here to help. Back off me. What are we looking for? Hey! Don't walk away from me! They burned down my home, they killed my best friend, now clue me in. This is really spooky, where is every body? Company picnic? What the hell is this place? What is that? - There was something here. A machine. - Machine? What kind of machine? - A very powerful machine. - Is that what this is all about? Industrial espionage... All the... God it's freezing in here. Thank you. Cut that out. How'd you do that? - I didn't. - Then who did? - Rohmer here. - Rohmer, why am I paying you so much money? - Shut up and listen. Is it true that the savage is still alive? - We do have a lead on him. - I'm leaving town right now. I want the savage eliminated. - Mr. Burroughs, you never said anything about killing people. - Do I need to remind you how you got your position, Captain? - I do remember everything you've done for me, Mr. Burroughs. - Good. - It looks like something or somebody is accessing t he Titan corporate files. Look, administrative records. Utility records, water, gas, electric, waste disposal, phone. There's gotta be something here. Look at that. Corporate retreat at Spirit Rock $350,000 dollars. Why would anyone need that much juice at a corporate retreat? - You know what to do, Moreno. - Freeze! - Don't shoot, don't shoot, no! No, no, don't shoot, don't shoot, don't shoot. I talked to Captain Rohmer. Captain Rohmer? Captain Rohmer? - You heard her. - Captain Rohmer tell them to put their weapons down! - Stand down. - I called them I know you don't understand but please trust me, this is the best way. You can't deal with these people on your own. Captain Rohmer... This... I don't even know your name. - Pleasure's all mine. Good work, Carter. Please? - Get your hands off of me. What are you doing? If you just relax everything's going to be alright. - He's got a gun! - He has no gun! Get off me! - Don't shoot, don't shoot! Put your guns down! Calling all units, pursuit in progress, Two suspects in a stolen black and white heading east on 8th street. Requesting addition backup. Chopper one moving into position. Three, four and five, cut them off at 7th street. Suspects... - Oh god why did that scumbag plant a piece on you? What the fuck is going on? The Captain's in on it which means I know way too much. I'm fucked, so fucked. - Oh god! Suspects heading south on Avenue B, all units intercept, over. - Holy! We got three units in front of them, they'll never get by. - Hold on! We have visual contact, two suspects in a black and white heading west on Arroyo. Suspects eluded roadblocks now heading west, over. - All I ever wanted to be was a cop, get out on the street and do some good. Guess that's pretty much over now that I'm a felon. Assaulting an officer, assisting an escapee, grand theft auto, aiding and abetting. I'm fucked, really fucked. I might as well get married, my life is over. - Got 'em in my sights they're heading straight for the freeway. - Do not lose eye contact. I'm sending all available units to converge units to converge on southbound freeway. - All available units, we have two suspects in a stolen black and white, heading south. Converge and intercept and prevent border crossing, over. - I need to go to Spirit Rock. - Where do you need to go? Spirit Rock? Hey, I know! And I bet you want me to drive, right? That's ok, my life is over anyway, I might as well go along for the ride. - Wait a minute they disappeared, I lost 'em. - Alright my friend Veronica lives... she used to live right over there. We can take her car. Ok, let's go! - I had him Captain, I swear I had him, I'm gonna double back and see if I can pick him up. - What do you mean you lost him? I want a statewide APB put out on both of 'em. And when they're apprehended, wherever that may be, I want them held until I come to collect them. My personal responsibility. You got that? The key's right here. Get in, hurry. The fugitives including Officer Nicky Carter. Escaped from Titan plaza in a stolen cruiser. - So this was his land. - I made him very offer too, an exceptionally good offer as a matter of fact. Through a mining subsidiary of mine. And the idiot refused to sell. - And this is the cave I presume where you found the machine. - Mhmm. - Well why must you digitize here? - Because it's a vortex point it's a condenser of elemental forces like Stonehenge or New Grange. Or the first temple at Jerusalem. Does this sound sort of New Age stupid to you, does it? You'll soon see. - Alright lets go, come on! - Look I really am sticking my neck out for you. Could you at least share something with me? Simple stuff... like your name. Who you are... what you do. Why I'm stuck in this fucking car with you... Stop that! You're making me crazy here. I'm not kidding, will you stop that? You want me to pull the car over? - Sometimes they tell me things. - What? Through the radio? Like stairway to heaven played backwards? Forget it, forget it. Tell me about your family, do you have a family? What are you doing? What the hell are you doing! Hello? Get your hand off the seat! We have to stop for gas. - We have no time. - Yea I know, we also have no gas. - Sorry! Fill her up? - Yea. Does the Titan corporation have a place around here? - Yea, about five miles north of here near the old dig site next to Spirit Rock. - Al? Is that you? - Do you know him? - Yea, you don't? - Just tell me who he is. - He was a rancher, he lived on the road a couple years ago. His whole family was killed. They put him in a crazy place, like a mental hospital. - Really? Don't call the cops, I will take care of it, ok? I just don't want to get him upset. - Put me through to Connie and hurry. - Is this where you... - Found it? Yes. A cro-magnon cave to be sure but these... They were obviously ancient pictographs but there was something, they seemed binary. - That's amazing. - This is just the beginning. - Sorry. - Come on let's go! - No! Not until you come clean. - What? - No wonder you wouldn't give me a straight answer. Hey! Your whole family killed. Did you kill them? Did the radio voices tell you to? - No! When they killed my wife and my boy... nobody helped. And nobody cared, except me. - You turn your back on me and I'm gone! I care! I care! I just... Hey! Who do I trust? - This is magnificent! - What's going on! - It's a generator! It's the most powerful machine ever created but it takes time to... It takes time to warm up! In about an hour we'll reach maximal dimensional thrust... and then... We digitize! A massive tremor rocked the western United States. Scientists are at a loss to explain what is causing the worst seismic activity in the history of this hemisphere. The quakes seem to be centered at an area called Spirit Rock. Strangely we have no record of a fault line in this area. - The damage to property has been tremendous. - Woah! Oh my god. - Everyone hold on. - What's happening! - We're tearing a hole in reality! And reality has mixed feelings about it! Daddy? Wanna play soldier? - Welcome home! Looks like the place could use some work. Let's go, come on, let's make it interesting bad boy! Yea? You're not fighting back, huh. Why not? Oh yea. You wanna die don't ya? You want me to put you out of your misery. You want me to do you like I did your wife? I enjoyed that. - Please! - I believe you. Get up! It's not over! - Power! The power's incredible! - Mr. Burroughs. Reese! Maybe we should stop, this is crazy. I mean if we tear a hole in reality... it will cause so much death... so much destruction... that there will be no one left to dominate with our immortality. There'll be nothing left to come back to. - Come back! Why! We're ascending the heavens! To hell with the apes! It's just too bad that the savage will be too late to save them. - Hold on! Get down! Then cover me. What? - Minorly amusing thought. - Tell me. - I just thought... If you were a cop... We'd make good partners. I think we'd get along. Oh my god! Go, go, go! - No, no! Put this on! Put this on! Please! Be careful! - Yes! I've done it! - Reese, get them away from me! - They won't hurt you! They're powerless in this world! When the digitized their way to divinity... They triggered a deluge that almost wiped out the human race. Since then whenever mankind deciphers the universe's most potent secrets, these cyber gods dispatch a savage to keep us from destroying ourselves! As if any self respecting god would give a damn! All exit routes from Manhattan are clogged as residents try to escape from the devastation. Ruptures in both the Lincoln and Holland tunnels left thousands stranded as water levels continue to rise. - Can you hear me! - Oh god. - Take care of him! A tremendous fissure has erupted... - Open the door. - Come on Marie! Life as we know it is a horror story! The constant fear of sickness, age and death! Teeth that rot! A back that can't bear to stand upright! N-Open the door! - Marie, please listen to me. Let go of your physical self! Let go! Your body is keeping your soul from freedom! - I like my body, Reese! I think I'll keep it even if that means I'll eventually rot and die! - Well then you leave me no choice! The Prime Minister has declared a state of emergency. - How stupid! How apelike! ...history. - Reese! No! It has never been seen before. Churches are filled with panicked citizens. Fearing that this is the final judgement of mankind. If things are true, they may just be right. Buildings are burning throughout the nation, cracks in the earth have swallowed dozens of homes and panicked residents are clogging the roads attempting to escape but there is no escape. The devastation is everywhere, the end of the world may just be upon us. Be praised the sword that brings salvation to the world. - Though cruel misfortune plagued thy steps. - We offer thee now thy reward. - Choose now if thy will to shed the scars of the past. - The painful memory of loved ones gone. - Or else choose to embrace the past and all you have become. - The first road is peace. - The other, eternal war. - In defense of the meek and needy. - Choose and so it shall be. Electrical power has been partially restored. Fire martial reports all fires now under control.
