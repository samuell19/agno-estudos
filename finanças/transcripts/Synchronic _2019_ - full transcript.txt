- 11:07 right? - Yeah. Fuck, shit. Tom! I swear to God, Tom's the worst driver we've ever had. You usually hide your hangovers better. My mouth tastes like nasty cinnamon whiskey. The glitter won't come off. Yeah, uniform got glitter on it? Oh, no, the room was dark. I couldn't tell which one was mine, so pretty sure this is her uniform from the athletic store. Fine, all right, I get it It's unprofessional. It's cold as fuck out here, man, thank you - Here we go. - Here we go. I think they need help. I hope she wakes up. I think she's got school in the morning. I'll take the kid. What happened? I was sleeping in the bedroom, and I heard French and, and the wind. Sir, can you hear me? Okay, I've got a chest wound. What'd you take, kid? How's it going in there, Steve? OD, figurin' it out Miss, what'd the kid take? What you got in your pockets? Miss... fuck! Heroin. Shit! That Narcan? Can I have some? Hands, where I can see them Keep 'em up. Drop your weapon. He don't look good, do he? How's it goin' in there, man? Dispatch fucked up, said assault. You show up to work dressed like Tupac, the fuck you expect? Victim is good. How 'bout in there? We've got a penetrating trauma in the torso, applying occlusive dressing to a sucking chest wound. And, hold on... what's that sound? Knife wound in his front. Exit out his back. A what? We'll make an airway en route. The fuck you lovebirds do to these nice people? Heroin overdose in the back. Knife wound. He shoot H, too? You do this? Probably did it to himself. Designer drug been makin' junkie monkeys go nuts. Ain't illegal though, so the fuck you gonna do, son? Back me up. Yeah, heroin possession is though. You want to tell us where you hid the weapon, the, um, the what, the uh? Three foot long knife. But isn't that a... Wanna save yourself some trouble and tell us where the sword is? Still waters run deep. Habla Ingl√©s, por favor? Let's get him outta here. Yeah. Don't have kids 18 years apart, dude. Well, you can't, 'cause we're old as fuck, but gotta keep that window slim. At least you can get a free babysitter. And even though Brianna's 18, and I love my daughter to death, she's a fuckin' awful babysitter. The pills will help against HIV. It'll take about six weeks to know for sure, but I've never had a positive from a needle stick. I sent it to the fast lab, so give you a call tomorrow about everything else. Is there any reason we shouldn't do a full workup? Ignorance is bliss, that's about it. Hangovers worse than usual, but that's probably from the drinkin and recreational drug use. We'll ignore the ganja and booger sugar markers Thank you. Hey, what'd you get my baby daughter? Uh, some condoms, magnums. Ah, Christ. Nah, they're earrings, man. She's one, man, nothing's pierced. It's strategy. So when you give her the earrings, she'll be old enough to know that I got 'em for her. Okay. A tiny dress would be a waste of money. Look, babe, Uncle Steve's sittin' all the way over here, because he went and slept with all mommy's friends before they married all those men over there. - That's not true. - Yes... - Oh, it's kinda true. - Yes, it is. Let me hold the baby, come on, let the girls see - what they're missin'. - Oh, that's a terrible idea. Come on, I'd be a great dad, come on. - Oh boy, okay. - No, no. - look at that. - Oh no, oh God. - Hey, ladies. Oh no. - Oh, the baby. Bad idea, bad idea. Oh, wait, why's your baby... And there we go! What did you do? - No, no, no. - Hey, hey, give her back. I think you busted her. Give her back, give her back. Racist baby. No. She seems happy. Yeah, no. Give her a break, man. She work during the day with lawyers, stay up all night with the kids, then have to deal with your ugly mug. I'm gonna go say what's up to Brianna She's bein' a little emo, incorrectly thinks you're cooler than me, 'cause I'm her dad and you're just some asshole who pops up from time to time. Yo, B. Hey, what up? - I got somethin' for you. - Yeah. You poured me a cheap one. You're not old enough to know what cheap beer is yet. I'm 18, and I know this is some cheap-ass lager. Fuck, stop sayin' your age. I don't want to think about 18 years goin' by that fast. Why you sittin' over here by yourself on this shitty rock? There's cake and barbecue and old, fat people over there. There's something wrong with me. Uh, no, no one died or anything, I just, uh, I, uh... Oh, excuse me for one second. Hello? Yeah, I'll be there on Tuesday, Doctor, thank you. Fuck, firemen have to get up early. Yeah. What time you go to work? I'm between jobs, so I thought it'd be a good time to visit with friends, but I'm thinkin' about makin' an app for power crystals, or astrology, or both, I don't know. That sounds like a really bad idea. Look, I have to run to work, so, um. Uh, oh, it was nice to meet you. It was nice to meet you, too. Be sure to lock the door on your way out, okay? Brianna wants to move onto campus, a room opened up. That's what she wants? Yeah. I'll, uh, I'll miss her. Gonna go with seven milligrams of morphine, in case the burn's second degree. You think of anything else? Uh, dry wraps. Hey, can you reach me a codeine, please? Shit, fuckin' Tom! Well, at least it's not you driving. What the fuck are you talking about? - I'm a great driver. - No, you're not. I'm the best driver you know. Nope, and a black man drivin' through the Garden District, we'd be pulled over so much, there'd be people dyin' all over New Orleans. Where's the victim? Why'd y'all tell dispatch there was a burn victim? There he is. Yeah, uh, that's a body, not a burn victim. New kid called it in. What happened to him? Passed out with a cigarette in his mouth or, you know. What? Beaumont, what'd you call this? Spontaneous human combustion. He's way into that shit. Yeah, how do we put that in a report? Anyways, somethin' to be aware of, honey bears. Passed out smoking, easy enough. It's evidence or whatever, so maybe don't touch it. - It's a snake bite. - Yeah, no shit. Miss, you happen to know what kind of snake bit you? Travis. We need to figure out what kind of poison this is. A Venom. It's not poison, it's venom. - That's what I said. - That's not what you said. That's exactly what I said. My ears be working and shit, that ain't what you said... So you gonna tell me what I said two seconds ago? That's okay, okay, okay. Well, he's gotta be here somewhere. We've searched through everything, man. It's not here. Travis. Oh, she checked in with her boyfriend. - Travis. - Dennis, look. Dispatch, unit 101 requesting back up to the 9th Street Hotel. We got a snakebite and an unknown possible O.D. A snake on the second floor of a fucking hotel. You remember that snakebite we ran out on in the boonies near Chalmette? Hey, Miss, are you in a Pentecostal religion? Some dude walkin' around with a fucking copperhead, - he thinks God's gonna save him. - It ain't no fuckin' copperhead. Well, what is it, bruh? I mean, the punctures, they're not the right size, and her response to the... venom it could only be a fuckin'.. Eastern Diamondback Rattler? There hasn't been an Eastern Diamondback seen in Louisiana in decades All right, want to help me find it? I know I can grab that motherfucker. Okay. Miss, I'm gonna find your friend Steve here's gonna mark the rate of swelling, so the ER know how much anti-venom to use, okay? This is fucking pointless, okay, let's go. All right, y'all be safe. Is it broken? There was a loud crash Something might have hit the sensor. It's, um, it's an odd one. You see here? That's your pineal gland. Now usually when there's a tumor in this area, it's inside, but yours is at the top, here, like a soda cap. I've never quite seen that. So what are you saying? Usually, an adult pineal gland is calcified to some extent, basically hardening with age, but yours is like a teenager's. My boyfriend's New Agey friend thinks it's a third eye seat of the soul or whatever, so maybe your unique endocrine gland makes you more enlightened. So how does that affect the cancer? It suggests to me it's been there a while, but it also looks like a glioblastoma, which are extremely aggressive so... So it won't be a slow death? I gave you the good news first. Hello. Hey listen, I know you're like a grown-ass lady about to move out of my house, but if you're gonna stay out all night, can you at least text us, please? All right. All right? Good morning. - Good morning - I love you. I love you, too. The bad news is it's inoperable, and we'll have to begin treatment no matter what. We'll have to track it. Truthfully, you could have six weeks or you could have 60 years There's a degree of chance, but closer to six weeks if we don't start you on radiation immediately. I, uh... In the meantime, here's some support groups and supplementary alternative therapies that patients have found helpful and ways of telling your family. - Whoa! - Ah. All right, what's up with your grades? Are you depressed? What? No. Just, um, I don't know what I wanna do. About what? My pregnancy. Yeah, the father, he's being really weird about it. No, like, like for work, like a job, you know, when college is done. Oh, so you have a, you have a C average because you don't know what you wanna be when you grow up? Well, now you're making it sound ridiculous, but, seriously, it's a lot of like crazy hard work for not knowing where it's going or if I can even do it. Of course you can do it. All right, let's think about this. What do you like? When you were a kid, you used to love watching the X-Files with me. You should be an FBI agent. All right. Let's play Horse without the E Look, I'm gonna say what I always say, but just listen this time. You remember this song from high school? Redman sampled Claude Debussy. Funny I can remember that, but I can't remember four years of AP French. Life's not fair. Hey. Happy birthday. Boom. Uh, it's real science-y. Yeah. Thanks, man. You know, when you think about it, strip clubs are like the one place you really can't have sex. Highlights certain things. Doubts, man, they never go away. You know, you think the wedding day is gonna dissolve that, and it is profound, but, you know, the doubts, - they never go. - I get it, bro. You're a guy in a relationship. You want this? No. But there's these few hours on a Sunday morning, after breakfast, the kids are there, we're having coffee together, listening to music, and I feel like I'm supposed to feel, you know? I haven't felt anything but whiskey and a hard dick in a decade. You're a blessed man. All right, as your humble, hypocritical, idiot, drunken, birthday celebratin' best friend, what's goin' on with all the pain killers? It's fine, man. I know, I know, just promise me you won't become a junkie-paramedic-cliche. I promise I won't become a junkie-paramedic-cliche. Unit 101, we have a 14-6 at University Fraternity Row, please respond. Upstairs balcony! Miss, can you hear me? Can you hear me? W-W-What? Do you know your name? I'm not the police. You, you need to help Tim. He has a heart condition, and I think he took too much coke. Before I passed out, his chest was hurting. Okay, okay, I'll get to Tim. I just need to know if there's somebody else that might need some help. Brianna. Okay, where's Brianna, and what did she take? She took the fake Ayahuasca from the store when she was sitting right there. Just go and check her room? Yeah, I know, just please, just please do it. Do it now, yes, please. Uh, okay, um. Tara, she's missing. Uh, I'm gonna call you back after I've, uh... They need to file a missing persons report, and... Hello? How can I help you, sir? You have Synchronic? Uh. - How many? - All of 'em. You have any more in the back? - Where? - The back, back inventory Oh we don't, we don't have that. So when do you get more? No, we don't, it's discontinued. This happens a lot with that stuff back there. How much? $105.14. You have good people dying every day. You in here killing your brain. People fuckin' gettin' stabbed with swords, fallin' down seven-story elevator shafts for this shit! I'm so sorry. I'm sorry, I didn't even know I was bothering you. I just, like, apologize... - Excuse me, sir. - What? I know this sounds strange, but, uh, could I buy that Synchronic off of you - for triple what you just paid? - No! Go home to your wife or your girlfriend, whoever. Be glad you didn't ingest this shit. - I'll give you $2,000. - Go home. The cell phone company said her cell is still inactive, but I got a hold of one of her friends from class who thinks that maybe she saw her at a party earlier that night and so I think if we just, we just keep posting on her social media. What? What are you doing? I'm printing these out, and then I'm gonna put 'em up. Can't you do something else while they're printing? Like call every hospital and jail in Louisiana and call the credit card company and ask the police to search the Mississippi while you were asleep? Why would you search the Mississippi? You know what I mean. She's not, she's not dead, so why would you search the Mississippi? We have to be realistic. I'm gonna, I'm gonna hire a private investigator. - The entire police department... - What are you doing? Shh, shh, shh, lay down boy, lay down, lay down. Stay, stay. Who's there? - Oh, oh shit! - Hey! Come, come the fuck outta there! - Wait, wait, wait! - Get outta my house! - Wait! - You motherfucker, what the fuck - are you doin' in my closet. - I'm not here to hurt you! - Get outta my house! - My name is Dr. Kermani. What the fuck are you doin'? I don't care. I'm the chemist who created Synchronic What are you.. You're what? My name is Dr. Kermani. I'm the chemist who created Synchronic. Come outta there. Okay. - Take your jacket off. - Okay. Turn around. Wait, what are you doing, what are you doing? No, no, no. Hello, yes, I have an intruder - in my house. - No, no, wait, wait. - I'm here to help! - Yes, ma'am. - Cause I heard you in the store. - My address is 1827 - You've seen what it does! - Alexandria Avenue. - Help, man! - Thank you. All right, you have until they get here, all right? Now, lucky for you this neighborhood, has a shitty response time. Can I, okay, all right. I make synthetic drugs. What I would do is create new drugs very similar to illegal drugs, but the molecules just different enough to be legal. I know what designer drugs are. The FDA finally cracked down on every variant we could come up with so we rushed out to market with what was meant to be a DMT-like drug that we synthesized from a red flower that only grows in a very isolated region of the California desert... Can I use the back of this? My mother recently passed away, I know how hard it is. - Condolences. - It's me. I have a tumor on my pineal gland. Sorry to hear that. But actually, um, Synchronic messes with the pineal, so you experience time as it actually is rather than the linear, one-event-after-another way that we normally experience it. Okay, um... uh, here You drop the needle on the song you wanna play, but they're all always there These tracks are like time, right? Synchronic is the needle. Adults partially go, appearing like ghosts in the past, but kids, since their pineal gland hasn't calcified, they physically go to another time entirely, Sometimes not returning. You expect me to believe that you came here to atone for your evils, and I'm just gonna give you back your drug that's killing kids? I mean, I only had a few accounts at some gas stations, smoke shops throughout Louisiana, some other states. I've been driving around buying them out. This was my last stop, Well, too bad, I flushed it all. So get out. It's all gone? Yeah. All of it, all of it's gone. Get the fuck out of my house. When Kyle recruited me I was working in a generics lab in China. Would've done anything to get back home, but I left a good teaching job for that money, so... There's just one more sample to eliminate. You know they say we see everything once in this gig? Pretty sure we've just seen our first junkie sword fight. - You all right? - Yeah. It's just a little tequila headache, I'm fine. Time for your, uh, your sermon again. Sir, there was a time when Dennis here and I were gonna go to med school, takin' a whole mess of science pre-reqs. Dennis here hated a lot of it, but I sort of became a armchair physicist. No equations or anything, just fun theories and history. Like, do you know the letter Einstein wrote to his dear friend Michele Besso's wife after he passed away? That's all right. He said, "Now he has departed this strange world a little ahead of me. This means nothing. People like us, who believe in physics, know that the distinction between the past, present, and future is only a stubbornly... persistent illusion." - Hey, Captain. - Hey, Dennis, do you have a minute? Yeah, what's up. I have a discrepancy between the morphine inventory and what the hospital pharmacy says we logged. I know you guys are clean, but keep an eye on other shifts, would ya? Yeah. We'll talk about it in the morning. You know, you don't have to be here. We can get another paramedic to come in. I don't wanna go home, I wanna fuckin' work. Yeah, but you and Tara should be together. All units be advised we have and open fracture at 1988 Bourbon Street. Unit 101 en route. Sir, can you tell me what caused the injury? Hey, do y'all know what happened to him? Did he fall from something? Sir, we can get you out of here as soon as possible, all right, we just want to stabilize the injury. and we'll take you to the ER, all right? Use saline to remove any large contaminants. I know. Apply the splint. Use some pressure. Stop tellin' me how to do my job, all right? - Someone has to. - What's that supposed to mean? Sir, do not smoke that now. You show up to work fucked up, it's not gonna be on me if you kill someone. We need to get a line of morphine in him. You sure we have morphine? What the fuck's that supposed to mean? You can't deal with reality, so you pop pills and get wasted every night. The reality you can't deal with is you're a forty-something child, and I've wasted half my life on bullshit loyalty. Shut the fuck up! I'm so fuckin' tired of you complainin'. You're disappointed in everybody around you. All you do is complain about your fucking wife, who's obviously too good for you, and you don't give a shit about your family! I don't give a shit about my family? Yeah, 'cause you're a selfish ass who only cares about... - Fuck you, D! - Yeah. Fuck you. Fuck you, get back in the ambulance Shut the fuck up! Tom, no, I need you, come back, help me for fuck's sake. Let's go back as far as we can to the very first moment the univer... Two deputies were injured. Details on what unfolded this morning and the arrests made since, and, finally, still no leads on a young woman who disappeared Wednesday night after taking bath salts - at a Tulane area house party. - Bath salts? I want to thank the community for their continuous... Where'd they get that from? ...for the missing person case of Brianna Dannelly. As many of the members in our community are aware, allied agencies and our agency have continued to search and are hoping for the safe return of Brianna Dannelly. It's so important that our community comes together and puts any information that they have out there for law enforcement. I'm asking for tips. Any of your tips can be sent directly to us and we will forward those to the New Orleans Police Department... She in here? Yeah, she's been in here for about a week. Might wanna step to the side She's from around... Bad things could happen. Oh! No, no, no! Don't hesitate to call us. especially if you have unexpected guests. Well if we do, we'll let ya know All right, take care everyone. Stay alert, we're waitin' around out here. Uh... If you're watching this, I'm probably trying to convince you of somethin' that's pretty unbelievable or I'm dead. Uh... This... This is a time travel pill. It allows you to go back in time for about seven minutes. I know it sounds... brain-damaged orangutan fucking crazy, but I was... I was just back in time. In this exact geographical location, before it was all pumped out, and it was still swampland. Now, another observation, things that touch you while on the drug seem to be a little distorted. My best friend, Dennis Dannelly, who's probably watchin' this if I'm dead, his daughter Brianna took it, and she disappeared. So hopefully with these experiments, I'll learn a way to bring her back. Or be stabbed by an early European settler, which sounds a lot better than wastin' away from cancer. Observation one. I'm not exactly sure why I went to a different time than the first pill. The only difference is exactly where I was in the room when the pill kicked in. And in that moment, seeing what years of barely surviving is like, this man probably 10 years younger than me but looking decades older despite his paleo diet, that I realized... The past fucking sucks, man! And, observation two, the exact place where you are when the drug kicks in determines the time you go back to. For example, this spot took me to the Ice Age twice. This spot took me to the swamp, dick-ass conquistador. And also leaves the question, if this door works both ways, how did Brianna get stuck back in time? Tara? What? My dad always says it's better to be single anyway. That looks bad to you? Just gross because it's them and boring, 'cause they're boring. Tell you a story. There was a time your dad was goin' through a drought, major drought. Girl wouldn't talk to him to save her life. She would drown in a river before talkin' to him. I met your mom in a bar one night. She was really nice, but I was tryin' to thin out my herd, too much goin' on. So I set him up. Then you came along. Luckily, not ugly like your dad, thanks to your mom. So I say all that to say, you're not gonna have the same problems that your dad did. Congratulations, be happy. Yeah? Uh, is it cool if I come in? - Yeah. - No. Stay there. Um, should I be scared? - No. - No, come on. - Hey. - Hey. Hey. Uh, what are we doing for dinner? You wanna go out? Let's go out. Yeah, I've got time before my shift. No, you should sleep You're slow and clumsy when you're well rested, so... There's only so many ambulance protein bars and IV hydration I can take. I want to go out for a real meal with all of us. - Sound good? - Yeah, let's go. Reported earlier this morning, a man was found dead of an apparent suicide from cyanide poisoning. Identified as Dr. Patrick Kermani of Ohio, a chemist for a drug manufacturer... Here we go. Last five Synchronic pills in the universe. This old coin, and the last few experiments got me thinking. What can I bring back and forth? This coin the stab victim had, the doorknob in the theme park. Nonliving things can travel, just not without distortion, and I've been fine. So, um... I'm gonna see if I can bring Hawking back in time with me through physical contact. That way I'll know every possible way I'll be able to bring Brianna back. Come on, buddy, come on. What'd you, where did you? Now, sir, look, I apologize, I can explain. Police! Police! Sir, if you'll just calm down, we'll leave. No, we'll leave, we'll leave! Come on! Shit. As soon as he goes to sleep, we're gonna get high and break in and get to our spot. Sounds worse than it actually is, right? - Go in there, and check. - Just keep looking. Here we go. He's got to be someone... I don't see... Sir, the window breaks. Here we go, boy. Come on, boy. Ooh. I'm gonna' search for... You son of a bitch! - Police! - Hawking! Hawking, come on, boy, come on! Hawking, come on! - Is he in there? - Come on! Come on, boy! Come on, man! Get in here! No, no, no! Hawking, no! Hawking! Observation three. Don't... Don't be... shit! Don't be late. Obs... Ooh. So it seems you have to be touching whatever you bring back, like quantum... mixing or something. Hawking had on his collar, so... It's chaotic how much of anything comes back safely. Either way, there aren't enough pills for me to go back and... find Hawking. And if you're late... You said that they sounded like Rain Man on cocaine. That is exactly what you said, it's a direct quote. - It's not very, very nice. - Yeah, they do. Come on, babe. - They do. - Please, please, please, Steve has other friends. Look, um, there's something I never told you. During the Katrina cleanup, Steve got this call, and a few coffins had been ripped out of Lafayette Cemetery and ended up in some Garden District yard. And a cleanup worker traced some of the serial numbers back to Steve. Two of them were his parents, and one was his little sister Dana. And Dana was just a kid when she died. And when we came across her coffin, it had been opened by looters, and seeing her tiny remains, all I could think about was Brianna, and I literally passed out. Pfft. And when I came to on the porch, Steve was asking if I was okay. I mean, if I was okay. And I got up, and I was leaning against one of those rich assholes' Roman columns while Steve watched his little sister being dragged out in her coffin to the truck to join his parents. And that was his 30th birthday. Hello. Marty and Doc are stuck in the rockin' '50s. Fuck Back to the Future. The past was hell. They tryin' to make it all look cozy and shit. Best part about the past was the music, which, with your boy and them. he tryin' to rock out to Chuck Berry. I try that, they'd put me in jail or, or worse. Huh, bro? Your favorite classic movies playing tonight on NOLA nine. Three pills left. Time to find Brianna. Aah! Brianna! Have you seen a girl? A young woman, a young lady? You, uh, what you, wait a minute, whoa, whoa, whoa. Hey, whoa, wow, what are you, no, no! Wait, wait, no! Wait, wait, wait, no, no, no, no, wait! Aah! Oh, shit. Apparently, the present can anchor you. What are you doing on my roof? Are you sure this is where Brianna was when she disappeared? No. She wandered off somewhere. Why the fuck didn't you say that? I almost... Go back inside, you high as fuck! With Brianna gone, I think my marriage is, um... I think I'm getting a divorce. She hates me. She knows me better than anyone, and she hates me. And she's right. She made an oath to love me unconditionally and she has. I made that same promise, and every day I wish I didn't hate half the music she listens to, or that she wore sexier underwear, that her tits were bigger, that she didn't sound so happy all the time, because I think that conspicuously happy people are dumb. So I get frustrated and I, I start these ridiculous arguments, secretly hoping that she ends it, as if that wouldn't fucking destroy me. Brianna was the one thing that was keeping us together, and now she's gone, so, uh... Remember that trip we took to Thailand and I... I got malaria and I was in that shitty hospital and all I could think about was her, getting home to her. That's how I feel now. She won't even look at me, because I'm such a fucking asshole. And I miss Brianna so fucking much. This is about you, Tara, and Brianna. Nothing else matters. And just so you know, my life sucks. Come on. I'm serious, man. It's no fun. You might see James Bond, but I experience Charlie Sheen, all right? What you and Tara have, even with all the fights, the ups and downs, the doubts, I'd take that shit in a heartbeat. I sleep around by default and then mourn the aspect of myself that used to feel something above... fuckin'. But then I found out I was dyin'. My brain... has a tumor. And all those things just seem trivial. That there's meanin' in the things I do have, and I want to spend the time I have preservin' 'em. I've been in treatment and I found out it's workin', but... when you're starin' down at the end, you realize there are things that are far worse than death. And none of those things are what you were upset about. How long have you known? Couple of weeks. Look, I'm sorry I didn't tell you. It's just... You know what, fuck you! Look, you have a right to be mad, all right? But you understand why it hasn't been a good time to tell you, right? Look, I'm tryin' to do my best, man. I was so close to making a bad haircut joke earlier. You know, it turned out it was Tom. Fuckin' driver who took the morphine. You probably drove him to it. Hey, it's not misplaced rage if the guy's a fuckin' idiot. Ah! So you've really been lookin' for the one this whole time? You know the real tragedy of meeting the love of your life? If it's happened, it's behind you. It's not gonna happen again. And although it's wonderful, what's ahead of you, it's really, really hard. You know, about that treatment thing, I decided to put it on pause. - There's somethin' that came up, - What are you talking about? - You're going to fucking chemo. - Something, look, something came up that's really important that I have to do. Then do it in chemo, bitch! You know the difference between your life and mine? Do you wanna know what the difference really is? What? Random events, chance, and luck Now, some people might think it's God or the universe or what the fuck ever, but that's what it is. Let's go see my family. I wanna show y'all somethin' There are things worse than death. Shit. Right. Listen, I would do anything to get her back, but this is... I know it's kangaroo shit loony, I know, but we gotta try. I'm not saying we shouldn't but, but you made it back last time, okay, maybe not next time. And who knows what else it's doing to you, I mean, the next dose could kill you. It should be me. It's gotta be me. Look, I have the youth tumor. Your pineal gland is old as shit. It's literally impossible for you. Now, if you were lost in time, and considering you raised her and you guys share the same DNA, let's assume that you would make the same decision. What would you do? I'd leave a message somewhere permanent. Uh, Hawking, he, uh... What? Uh. It's just been... oh man, if all this works out, I'll, I'll tell you about it someday. This is delicious. This dirty, shitty river, this beer, this time, wouldn't change it. The clock just... keeps tickin' down and the lower that number gets, you realize how fucking amazing now is. The present is a miracle, bruh. That's a pretty shitty, misspelled, unspecific message, huh? "Allways"? Remember that home hospice call we had a few years back, 100-year-old woman, she had end-stage kidney disease, all those pictures with like Louis Armstrong and Nina Simone? Yeah, I remember that. Well, she had this book on her nightstand. Can't remember what it was called but something like, Facing Death with a Smile, or some bullshit. While we were waiting for the coroner, I thumbed through it, and there's this passage about how we're all most likely to die. Brianna, she asked me about that, and it's like a third of us will be prolonged in a bed, a third of us will be a sharp decline in a bed, and a third of us will be a roller coaster of organ failure, again, in a bed, being treated, and the tiniest percentage... is sudden death. And that's our business, man. We... We're seeing the exceptional ones. That's what you told your daughter? That's the most fucked up... No, man, no, no, no. What it made me realize is that we know how it ends. Mystery solved. And in death, the wild cards of fate are the exceptional ones. But in life, all that crazy shit that happens before you die, there's always infinite possibilities. So, yeah, the last thing I ever said to her as her father was alway... Shit, shit! Brianna! Brianna! Brianna! Brianna. Brianna. Tara, it's me. I need you. Really fucking need you. Hello? Hello? Steve! How did, how did you find me? The message. What? What message? Don't worry about it. Here, take this. It's time to go home, just take it. Where's yours? I'm good. Come on. Okay. Any minute now, something from the present is gonna appear nearby, all right? Now, if we're not back at the boulder by the time it disappears, we'll be stuck here forever. Okay? Aah! - I'll help you across. - No! You're gonna run as fast as you fucking can. Go, go, go! Ya with the slave! Come'ya, shoot ya, both ya! Okay, all right Don't move. Yeah. I'm your slave. Come here! Everything's gonna be all right. Get down on your knee. Okay, okay. Yeah. I'm your fuckin' slave. You come on. Come on. Come on! Now come on and get your fuckin' slave! Oh, shit! You okay? I'm fine. I'm totally fine. - Oh, my God. - Sorry. Don't be sorry.
