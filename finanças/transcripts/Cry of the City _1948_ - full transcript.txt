Lieutenant! Yeah? I have Martin Rome, 357, Court Street. - Right? - Good enough. Age 29. Appendix removed four years ago. Knife scar on shoulder. Blood type A. - No further record. - No record? Shh! Per favore. What do you want? For five years, he pulls every trick in the book. Tonight, he holds up a restaurant and kills a cop. - No record? - I mean, medical, sir. Why? Why did they do this to him? Marty. Marty. Teena. You shouldn't have come. I had to come, Marty. The radio... It said you were badly hurt. It said you were... Go away, Teena. Don't get... mixed up in this. Oh, Marty. Why did you have to shoot? Why did you kill? I had to. I thought we could... Marty, does it hurt terribly? Kiss me. I can't die now. Oh, Marty, Marty! Lieutenant! We bill the Police Department on this, right? - Right. - Keep him alive, we'll give you a bonus. Shall I have his wife sign the release for the operation? - I don't think he has a wife. - What about that girl in there? - What girl? - The girl who's in there now. Are you sure you saw a dame? Collins! I tell you, this is a matter of a man's life. I've got to see him. But Dr Williams is operating immediately. I can't let you go up. Hiya, counsellor. Lieutenant Collins. Well, Niles, I didn't know that chasing ambulances was quite in your line. Please, this is serious. Is Martin Rome still alive? Just about. You've got to let me see him. He hasn't got a quarter. I'm not interested in defending a cop killer. I knew McCreedy, too. Yeah. What do you want to talk to Rome about? If he's dying, I want a confession from him. He can save an innocent man. A confession to what? His implication in the DiGrazia case. The DiGrazia case? Why, you're crazy! We're holding Whitey Leggett on that. All we need is to get... - Oh! - That's right. Leggett's my client. I admit it. And he's got plenty against him, but he didn't do the DiGrazia job. And if I can talk to Martin Rome, I can prove it. Torturing old ladies? I don't think Rome goes in for that. Candella, please. Time is precious. You know I wouldn't come here in the middle of the night on a wild goose chase. - This is a man's life. - Maybe we'd better let him. OK. If it's all right with the doctor, it's all right with me. - It's in his hands now. - Thank you. Rome, can you hear me? This is Niles, the lawyer. Do you understand? I want you to concentrate, just for a few seconds. Rome, they're holding Whitey Leggett, Whitey Leggett, for the DiGrazia case. He didn't do it, Rome. He did not do it. You know that. You can save him. Rome, you're in bad shape. You may not pull out. Don't go with this on your soul. Please, Rome, just tell us you were in on the DiGrazia case. Rome? You don't have to say anything. Just nod. You killed her. Just nod. You killed Mrs DiGrazia. Go... ...fry. Rome, please, just listen to me for a moment, will you? - That's all. He's unconscious again. - Can't you...? Just for another minute? Listen, sir, if we don't get your friend to surgery, he'll never come to. That's tough. I did my best. Did you catch what he said there? - Why, I think he... - I heard him. He told you to 'go fry'. I think he meant it. If you want us to say that in court, we'll be glad to. Of course, of course. There you are, Lieutenant, all ready for you. - Thanks. How are you doing? - Oh, I ain't kicking. Hey, how's that Marty Rome making out? Is he gonna live? He was pretty rough for a couple of days, but I think he'll pull through. I see his mother heading for church every day this week. I think it'd have saved them some grief, if he'd have croaked. Maybe you're right, Julio. See you tomorrow. Take it easy, Lieutenant. Close enough? I haven't the strength. Miss Pruett? Yes? Could you see if it's close enough? Please? Nurse. Well? - What do you want? - Could I talk to you a minute? I thought I ought to tell you that... Rome is a pretty bad boy with women. Just what is that to do with me? Nothing, really, I just thought I would tell you in case... Look, Lieutenant, I've been working around here for a good many years. I don't expect anyone to tell me how to care for patients. I beg your pardon. You should. - She's pretty hot, huh, Candella? - Smart guy! We oughta throw you in a cell. Four bullet holes. Every place you look a bullet hole. - Even the doctor says... - If you're looking for sympathy, save it. I just left Mrs McCreedy, the wife of the guy you killed, you murdering rat. She looked fine. Eyes all red, tears streaming down her face and you lie here getting shaved. - I oughta haul you out of bed and beat... - Go ahead. Beat me, I'll die. Yell at me, I faint. You'll answer the questions I've got to ask and you can drop that fancy lingo, see? Listen to me! - Marty... - Yes, Lieutenant? - Is this your ring? - Yeah. Yeah, that's mine. - You got the rest of my stuff, too? - Where did you get it? How about it, Marty? Where did you get it? I don't know. A crap game, two or three months ago. It's all right, huh? - I do pretty good with the dice. - Who from? From er... a blond fella. Yeah, with a droopy eye. Leggett. Whitey Leggett. You wouldn't know we were holding Whitey Leggett on the DiGrazia case, would you? Who else was in the game? - Oh, I don't know. Tommy Mills, maybe. - Tommy Mills is dead. Look, Candella, what are you asking me all this stufffor? I win a ring, so, what's the difference? Come in, Nurse. We'll only be a minute. Marty... this ring is part of the collection - stolen from Mrs DiGrazia. - Not by me. 100,000 dollars worth, Marty. Maybe you read about it. - Nope. - We're anxious to get who did it, Marty. They tortured her until they found out where she kept the stuff. Then they strangled her. - Not very pretty, huh? - You got Whitey Leggett. Go talk to him. We will. But we wanna talk to you, too. Look, Candella, I shot a policeman, he shot at me. Now I'm going to the chair. Suppose I say I did it, so what? I go twice? Huh! I had nothing to do with it. Besides, a fella and his girl did the job. Uh-huh! So you do read the papers. You got a smart partner, Candella. Look, I've never worked with a girl in my life. They talk too much. Yakety-yakety. Marty, who was the girl that was here the night they brought you in? Girl? I thought it was a dream. There was a girl here, huh? Yes, Marty. - Who was she? - I don't know. - I wish I did. - What did she look like, Marty? An angel. I thought maybe... Maybe I was dead. All right. Cut it out, Marty. We found one of the DiGrazia rings on you and we know that the girl was here. Now stop the monkey business and tell us who she was. I tell you I don't know. I never saw her before. OK, Marty. But you'll be seeing her again, cos we're going to find her. And don't think for a minute we won't. Come on, Collins. - Here. Take this. - No. - You've got to. Here. - I'd sooner die. Something heavy here presses on me. Your conscience. Did you hear those two? They say I tortured an old lady. Me. Martin Rome. Miss Pruett, you're a nurse, you know people. Do you think I'd do that? - You killed a policeman. - He had me down. It was him or me. Miss Pruett, you must do something. - Do something for you? - No, not for me. This is for a girl, my girl. Oh, no, wait, please. You heard the police. They said I had an accomplice, a girl. I swear to you, this girl is innocent. - Then she hasn't anything to worry about. - She has. She's a child. They pick her up, she won't know what to. She won't have a chance. Miss Pruett, you've got to help me. - There's nothing I can do, I... - Oh, but there is. Look... Her name is Teena. Teena Riconti. Not even the police know that. I'm telling you because I trust you. This is her address. 25 Bank Street. - Where did you get the pencil and paper? - Please, just go there. Tell her to go away. Tell her to hide. If you think you can talk me into that, you're crazy. Just see her, look at her. You'll know. Here. I have police permission to talk to him. Well, go ahead. Hello, Martin. How are you? Fine. We go bowling, huh? At least your mind's all right. Martin... I'm going to defend you. - Why? - I think I can get you off. You talk pretty good. I think I like this. How are you gonna do it? Oh, there are angles. Self-defence. McCreedy has killed a couple of other men. I'll need your complete confidence, though. Of course. The DA thinks you were in on the DiGrazia case. Ha! It might not be a bad idea to admit it. Why? That's the angle. Ah. The whole city is on the DA's neck over the DiGrazia case. Robbery and murder. For a confession, I think he might make a deal. - Second degree. - Second degree, huh? No chair? That's not bad. As long as you're alive, there's always probation. It might take time, but... But if I confess, so what? How am I gonna prove it? I got no jewels. I don't know how the job was done. Hmm... Yes. There's a chance I might get one or two pieces on it. I wondered why you came in the other night. You thought I was too sick to remember, huh? "Tell 'em you did it, Rome. "Don't go with this on your soul, Rome." I remember. - Now, wait a minute, Marty. - Go ahead. Get out. Get out, you crook! You think I don't know you work for Whitey Leggett? You think I lie here and count my fingers? You think I'm gonna take the rap for you? Get out! Go confess yourself. Don't get excited, Marty. I'm sorry. I shouldn't have tried to pull that on you. Be practical, my friend. You're going to the chair anyway. You killed a cop. You can't beat that. Get out! Homicide is beginning to think you and your girl did the job. - I got no girl, Niles. - Of course you haven't. But what would you think of $10,000, Marty? If you had a girl, $10,000 would take her a long way. You haven't, so we'll give it to your mother. Think of it, Marty. $10,000, just for a couple of lines that don't mean anything to you, anyway. - I think I'll have that cop throw you out. - They're looking for that girl, looking hard. Let 'em look! She must be beautiful, Marty. And you always could pick 'em. Dark, I bet. With a face like a Madonna. Huh, Marty? - Niles... - Young, too. So knock off that yapping. The police can't find her, Marty, but maybe we can. Maybe we can even make the police believe she did it. They might not. Not the way she is now, Marty. But, if we worked on her for a couple of days, maybe she wouldn't be so sure herself. Maybe she wouldn't look the same. Maybe even you wouldn't recognise her. Maybe she would... Help! Nurse! Help! Nurse! He tried to... kill me. Teena... Teena... - A sedative. - Teena... Teena... Teena... Teena... You will find the figures correct, Signor Vaselli. Certainly. The cash balance is 37 dollars and 83 cents. There's 10, 20, 30, 35. 36. 37. Oh, I took eight cents for car fare the last time. - Please. - Oh, prego. Fratello, the Society has instructed me, as President, to thank you for your long and honourable service that you rendered to our organisation. We hope... Well, we hope sometime... Mario. My dear friend. I'm very sorry. Mama! Mama! Mama, a policeman! Lieutenant Candella. - Hello, Mama. - This way, please. - Hi, Kaputo. - Hello, Candella. Vaselli. I'll be back in a minute. - Won't you be seated? - Thanks, Mama Rome. I can only stay a few minutes. You keep company to the Lieutenant Candella. I will only take off my apron. - Oh, Mama, you shouldn't have done that. - Oh. You drink first. - How is Martino? - He's all right, Mama. They moved him from the hospital today. - Moved? - Yes, to prison. Oh. Vittorio, what will they do to him? Well, first he'll be tried, then... I don't know. Then? You know perfectly well, Mama, that he killed a policeman. Yes. I can't understand why he did it. Martin was always such a good boy. He sent me money every week. Sure he sent you money, Mama. But... how did he send you money? What kind of work did he do? I don't know. I don't know. Martino was very smart, you know. - A very smart boy. - Very smart. Mmh. But he should have married and settled down like you and Papa. Yes. Didn't he have a girl? Sure. Angelica Morelli. I made a contract with her father, Morelli. But, er... - Any other girl? - No, no other girls. - He liked Carmen Domingo. - Helena! Well, he told me so. Well, I... think I'll be getting along. Just one minute, Lieutenant Candella. Goodbye. Vittorio, please, tell me something. What are they going to do to him? Do you think Martino will be... Mama, that snoopy Candella is in the neighbourhood. Don't tell him that... Hello, Tony. Don't tell him what? I'll tell you nothing, copper! Antonio! You talk polite to the police! Lieutenant, will you see Martino? Well, I... I hadn't planned to. Please, you give this for me. Well, Mama, I, er... Please. - OK, I'll give it to him. - Thank you. Thank you. I'm awfully sorry. Now, just a minute, Mama... Did you put a saw in it? Oh, no, a little hot soup. And you tell him we all love him. Please, Vittorio, will you? Goodbye, Mama. - You don't like it, huh? - Oh, it's fine, Mr Ledbetter. When do you change the sheets? Decoration Day? You want 'em changed, you gotta pay. - How much? - Deuce. - I'll give you a buck. - Two. I'll talk to the night man. OK, wise guy, a buck. All right, you mallard head, what are you doing? Get moving! Crazy old cluck! Mallard head? Cluck? Who does he think he's talking to? Every day he tells me that. Ah, don't let him bother you. He's a big boob. That's right. A big boob! Calling me a cluck! Hey. - You're Martin Rome, ain't you? - Yeah. - You killed a cop, huh? - Uh-huh. I'm Orvy. I'm a trustie. Hello, Orvy. Wanna break out of here, Marty? - What? - Break out. It's easy. This ain't no prison, just a plain old hospital. You break out, that Ledbetter gets blamed, and they throw him out, Marty, huh? They throw him out, huh? It's kinda tough, isn't it? Ah, it's nothing. You can do it, Marty. Look. How does it work? I'll show you. I've been here three months. They don't know I know that. Let me get my keys, Lieutenant. Lock it, Orvy! I'll only be a few minutes. Take your time, Lieutenant. Take your time. - I'll leave the door open for you. - Thanks. - Some soup from your mother. - Oh. Mama! How is she? How do you think? Yeah. - How's Pop and the kids? - OK. I saw your brother, Tony. - He's a great boy, huh? - Yeah. I bet he told you where to head in. 'A great boy'. He thinks you're a hero, Marty. Six to eight years from now, I'll be chasing him, too. Maybe. He'll have plenty of fun first. Do you think it's worth it, Marty? How much money you make, Candella? 94 dollars and 43 cents a week. 94 dollars and 43 cents? It don't go far. Ever go to Florida for a couple of weeks? You ever bet 100 bucks on a horse? Or maybe give a girl a big bunch of orchids just because you like her smile? No, but I sleep good at nights. In some cheap room. Nah, not me. I had enough of that when I was a kid. - Crummy tenements. No food. No clothes. - Save it for the jury, Marty. Who do you think you're kidding? I was brought up in the district, too. I've heard that dialogue from you hoodlum hotshots ever since I was ten years old. "Get hip. Only suckers work. "Don't be a square. Stay with the smart money. "Let the old man get calluses digging ditches." No food, no clothes, crummy tenements... You're breaking my heart, Marty. OK, you played it your way, I played it mine. Think it's worth the chair? I don't know. I haven't tried yet. Maybe you won't mind. You'd be the centre of attention. Me, I kinda think of afterwards. You know, when they slide that pine box through the back door. And somebody in the family has to identify it before they can take it away. All right, I do what I do, I get the chair, nobody else. - Yeah? What about the girl, Marty? - What about...? Oh, you mean the angel, huh? - You mean, you haven't found her yet? - No. - You'll look a long time, Candella. - Stop clowning, Marty. Look... I'll play square with you. If you're shielding an innocent girl, tell me who she is. If her story checks with yours, I'll call the dogs off. There is no girl, Candella. OK. I'll have to keep on looking. It's kinda dull work. You certainly picked some pips. - What do you mean? - Well, how about this little number? Constancia Lopez. - Well... - And Brenda Martingale. - Oh, brother! - She's not as young as she used to be. And Maria, Helen, Patricia, Rachel, - Rosa Rita... - Ah, Rosa Rita! She'd be a fine one to take on a job. They'd hear you in Newark! One of them may be the one I want, Marty. - You're crazy. - Maybe. - Guard! - Coming up, Lieutenant. Then there's Valena Andrea. And Teena. Teena Riconti. - Know her, Marty? - I don't know any Teena. I will. I'll tell you about her. Orvy! Orvy! Orvy! I've got to get out. Now! Give me that spoon. No, Marty, no. Not now. You can't make it. I got it all timed. - When? - Well... Let's see... Tomorrow. Tomorrow? I can't wait. Maybe Ledbetter won't be here tomorrow and you can't blame him. Oh, yeah. Maybe. That's right. Look, I bring your tray for lunch at 11. I gotta fix it so you got a pass. I gotta fix it so you got a pass waiting at the desk. In the name of... - Tony Corino. - Tony Corino. Orvy, are you sure this will work? - Sure. I've been working on it. - Orvy! I told you what was gonna happen if I catch you wasting time. Now, get your bucket and get outta here. - Mr Ledbetter. - What? - The guy in number four. - Yeah? I think he wants to make a deal for them cigars. Orvy! - Are you sure this will work? - Oh, sure, Marty, it can't miss. - It'll just go like I said. - What about the pass? It's there, Marty, honest. Don't forget. Tony Corino. - If you're trying to pull something on me... - Oh, no, Marty, no. Gee, I told you, they don't figure a guy tries to break outta here. Why haven't you tried? I ain't got it anymore, Marty. A bum ticker. I tried it once, though, honest. But she just goes, 'Bump, bump, bump'. You ain't scared like that, are you, Marty? No. No, get out, leave me alone. Come on, come on, get the lead out. Marty, come on. You only got a couple of minutes. - Come on. - Shut up! Visitor? You were supposed to be out at 11. Name? Tony Corino. Brother, huh? Who wrote this for you? Must be a new guy downstairs. He writes like a three-year-old. Sign here. Hey! Turn this pass in at the end of the tunnel. Are you coming, Ledbetter? Yeah. Oh, wait a minute. I forgot my keys. I should wait for that joker. - First visit, hey? - Huh? - First time here, isn't it? - Yeah. I can always tell. Something about a guy's first time. - Nervous or something. - I suppose so. Hey! Just a minute. Yeah? OK, just a minute, I'll look it up. He's in there, Lieutenant. We checked right after we got your call. About ten minutes ago, he asked the janitor for Teena Riconti. Then he went up. - Cover all the exits? - With the best men in the precinct. - Good. - We got a dame on the second floor who's gonna give us a pitch when he leaves. - Let's go in and get him. - That's it. He's coming out. - Let the boys take him now? - Wait a minute! That's his kid brother, Tony. I should have known he'd do something like this. Hey! It looks like he's coming in here. - Jim, watch him. He knows me. - Right. Mr Angelo, please. - It's for you. - Thanks. Yeah? OK, OK, I got it. See you later. Arrivederci. The piece of paper, Tony. - What are you doing, trying to kill me? - Ah, be quiet. Ardanquin 5502... There's a number missing. What is it, Tony? If I remembered it, I wouldn't have wrote it down. I don't know. - Call 'em all, Jim. - Huh? 55021, 55022, 55023... I want a report of anybody that lives in that building across the street. Right. How about this? Take him home and have his mama give him a good spanking. - Ardanquin 550... what? - 2-0. Ah. - He should be here any minute. - That's all right. I'd like to get him to sign these papers so I can go to lunch. I'm really surprised he's so late. I'll sign them and we'll both go to lunch. I'm sorry I'm late, Vera. I wanted to talk to the judge. - Any calls? - Nothing important. Mr Angelo has been waiting. Oh. Yes. Mr Angelo? Come right in. - Oh, Mr Niles. - Yes? Did you want to sign these letters now? I'll only be a few minutes, Vera. Surprised, Mr Niles? A little. But then you're a pretty fast worker, Marty. Push it back a little, Niles. There's too many buttons around there. Now, listen, Marty... Don't come in here and get tough. I do business with your kind every day. "Tough"? Who wants to get tough? This is business. You come to the hospital to see me. I come to see you. Mm-hmm. That, er... that business about your girl... - You knew that was just... - Oh, sure, that was just a bluff. Mm-hmm. That was a pretty good deal you made me, Niles. Oh? 10,000 would take me a long way. I think I sign that confession. Well... A confession was only good while the cops had you, Marty. Oh, not good now, huh? - Uh-uh. - That's too bad. Then you'd just better loan it to me, huh? Loan it to you? $10,000? I got no money. I... Well... I don't keep that kind of money here, Marty. But if this will help? Maybe you got some more in the safe, huh? No. No, I never keep cash in the office. Let's open it and see. Let's stop this nonsense, Rome. I've given you all I'm... You... Listen, you... Let's open it, huh? There's nothing there but legal papers. OK. Let's take a look. I... - See? - Take 'em out. Bring it here. Why you...! No! - Open it. - I haven't the key. Come on, open it! The DiGrazia jewels. Now I think we'll talk. Whitey Leggett and the girl. You ran the job. Who was the girl? - I don't know anything about it. - Niles, I kill a policeman. - I kill you. It makes no difference. - Marty... no. Come on! Who was the girl? She was some friend of Whitey's, some girl he knew in show business. - I didn't know her. - What was her name? - I didn't know her! - What's the name? Rose. Rose Given. Something like that. Marty, dinner is ready. Your leg hurts badly? Yeah, pretty bad. - I guess I better get it fixed before... - Wait a minute. You'd better eat first. I go round the corner to the drugstore. Tell him to get out before I come back. - Aspetta un momento. - This is my house. I gotta fix my leg, Mama. Get me some bandages, unguento and a clean shirt. Yes. I'll get the scissors and cut off your bandages. Never mind, Mama. Do it later. Marty! Why do you do these things? Oh, I don't know, Mama. You get going on something like this, you can't stop. First the policeman and now... Now they say you killed another man today. Is this true, Marty? Yeah. - I killed him. I had to kill him. - Why? Why must you kill, Marty? Why? I can't understand. You, Marty, my first... Il mio bambino piu buono. The one who sends me money, the one I pray for every night. - Why must you kill? - Mama, don't! I loved you, Martino, more than the rest of them, cos you were my first. You sent me money, but you never told me where it came from. I didn't ask. That was my fault. I knew in here, I knew... but I didn't ask. - That was my sin. - Mama, it's not you. I... - I did it myself. I did it for a girl. - Sure, sure, Marty. With you, there's always a girl. Mama, Teena is different. I love her. Can't you believe that? I love her. No! You don't love her. You have no feelings for other people. You only care for Marty. Mama... Mama, do you believe that I love you? Then you must believe that I love this girl. She's my life, Mama. She's good and she's beautiful. When a man tells me that he will hurt her, that he will give her to the police, this man I must kill! You understand, Mama? No. Love I know. Love that has come through killing cannot last. - Mama, I tell you... - I'll tell you! I tell you, you cannot kill. I tell you, you are bad, Martino. All right. I did it. So what? I can't bring a man back to life. Mama, I'm so tired. I'm so cold and my leg hurts. I've got to sleep and rest! I'll get your coat, Marty. - The heavy one. - Mama, I tell you, I gotta sleep here. I'll bring your coat. Because he said so, you'd throw me out... This is my home, too. There are other children. You must go, Marty. I'll bring you food and you will go. It's Tony. How about that flatfoot? Twice around the block and he's walking in circles! - What about Teena? - I told you, Marty. A dame came and took her away, two days ago. No address. No nothing. But the woman, what did she look like? Oh, I don't know. Kinda heavy and tall and... and middle-aged. A blue cape, I think the landlady said. What's the matter, Marty? Is that OK? It's OK, Tony. Good boy. Now, get the scissors and we'll take the bandage off. Lieutenant Candella. This way, please. Hello, Mama Roma. I didn't expect you. - Won't you be seated? - Let's sit in the kitchen, Mama. It's so much warmer out there. - Besides, it smells so good. - In the kitchen, Vittorio? You sit here. I'll bring you anything you like. Uh-uh. Mmh! Minestrone! - Oh, that smells wonderful, Mama. - Buono, ma freddo. It's cold. I prepared it for Tony, but he's not home yet. Sit down. I'll give you a nice hot bowl of soup. I want to see Tony, Mama. I think I should talk to him. Why, sure. Sure. - Has he been bad? - No, not really bad. Not yet. Isn't that his cap? Oh, yeah, Tony's cap. That boy always goes out without a hat. Here. Good and hot. I'm sorry, Mama, but I've got to look around. Don't move, Candella. Put your hands on the table. Stand away, Mama. Tony! Get his gun. Stay where you are, Tony. There won't be any shooting in this house while Mama's here. I'm disappointed in you, Marty. You're a big boy now. You're a pretty funny fella. You don't think I'll shoot. Just make a move, Candella, and we'll see. So that's your hero, huh, Tony? He breaks out of jail, fools the cops. Talks big with a gun in his hand. Well, look at him, Tony - his legs shot full of holes, fever going up, no place to go, no place to sleep. Just run, run, run, till he can't run anymore. Escape? Escape to where? Look at him, Tony. He's a dead man. Make an Italian a cop, he's gotta make a speech. OK, Candella. Maybe you catch me, maybe you don't. Arrivederci. I'm sorry, Mama. You big, stupid cop! You got her crying! It'll be better if she only cries for one of you. Yeah? Well, he got away, copper. He won't go far. Sit down, Tony, I want to talk to you. Sit down! Rose Given, eh? If she was in show business, we got her, honey. How about a couple of new poses for you? Not for me, Mike. I gotta eat three times a day. The split week has got me down. Yeah, business ain't like it used to be. Rose Given? A singer, I'll bet you. The Gracie Sisters and Lynch. A great act. Next to closing. I followed them once in Cheboygan. Gardener & Harris. The Three Graces. Given... Rose Given. Ah! Rose Given! It's only... It's only a negative. I can make you a print in a couple of hours. I'm in a hurry. You got her address, Mike? Sure. I remember her now. A terrific set of pipes. The loudest voice you ever heard. Alto. She couldn't carry a tune in a wheelbarrow! Come on, Mike. I'm in a hurry. You got the address? I should have it, if she ordered more. I can't tell. 1933. The picture is 15 years old. She may be dead. I don't think so. Rose Given... Rose Given... Ah! Madame Rose. Now we're getting somewhere. Madame Rose... Here it is! 'Madame Rose. Swedish massage.' Madame Rose! Thanks very much. Listen, Mike, I'll come over sometime and buy you a drink. Anything for a lovely girl like you. Ah, go on! I found her, Marty. Here. Hey! Hey, what's the matter, Marty? Oh. I fell asleep. I found her. Madame Rose. Good. Good girl. Take me up there. I can't keep driving around. They'll catch us. - They'll pinch me with you, Marty. - Take me to Rose Given. No! You said I could go as soon as I found her. You promised me, didn't you? Hey, Marty! What's the matter? Oh, Marty, don't! You'll get us both in an awful mess. Mart... What am I gonna do? Drive. We cannot stay here. Is it bad? Is he gonna die? I don't know. Keep quiet. Just drive. But I can't just drive around. Somebody is gonna see us. I have no licence to practise. We cannot stop. You must drive. I'm sorry. These are bullet wounds. You did not tell me. I was scared you wasn't gonna come. It's against the law, whatever I do. But this? This will cost you more. - I need money. 200. - All right. I don't care. He's got it. He's torn his wounds by moving. They fester. It must have been bad. - Can you fix 'em? - Only for a short time. He must get treatment. I must have light! - Quickly, pull in! - But I can't. They'll see us. Pull in. You want him to die? Pull in somewhere. Come back here. - What shall I do? - Open his collar. Oh, I don't have any brandy. My wife is sick. I gave it to her and forgot it. - I need some spirits. - Spirits? Whiskey, brandy, anything. Quick. Hurry! All right. Hey! Psst! Jack! Jack! - Hey, listen... - Well, hello, little lady! Get lost! Will you give me a double brandy? Doubles? Well, that's a girl after my own heart. You and I could go places together. Make mine a double, too, pal. The lady has made an excellent suggestion. No, no, no. This is on me. Drop dead! Doc, will you please hurry? Please? - Here you are. - Why don't you be a nice boy and beat it? That's no way to talk to a fella. What's the matter? Your boyfriend pass out? You're a little over trained. Get out of here before I lose my temper. All I wanna do is help. If the guy is folding up. Look, honey, you really wanna help me? I left my purse in the bar. Why don't you go and get it for me? Delighted. Anything to be of service to a lady. How is he? He'll be all right for the time being. Money. One... two hundred. What am I gonna do with him, Doc? Good night. Oh... Hey, what did you say you lost? - Thanks, Brenda. - Marty, you're not gonna fold up again? No, I'll be all right. I'll get in touch with you. I'm sorry. We're closed. Are you Rose Given? I gotta talk to you. I said, we were... You're Martin Rome. Come in. My apartment is in the back. You wanted to talk to me, Martin? Say it quickly. The police may be after you. Oh. I think we can do business. - I don't think so. - Oh, yes, we can. You were in on the DiGrazia case with Whitey Leggett. That's ridiculous. You ought to know better than to walk in here and try to bluff me like that. I'm glad you killed him, Marlin. He was a bad man. Very bad. And he shouldn't have told you that about me. He wasn't so bad. He gave me the DiGrazia jewels. How do I know? A pearl choker with a ruby pendant. Seven rings. A diamond bracelet, with the clasp broken. You must have been in a hurry, huh? Where are they? In a locker in a subway station. I thought if you went to all that trouble to get 'em once, you might want to get 'em again. You're a cute little man, Martin. I should have worked with you, instead of that fool Leggett. Someday. You can't tell. How much do you want for the jewels, Martin? A car, five thousand dollars, a way out of the country and a good night's sleep. - That's a big order. - It's a lot of jewels. I can take 'em someplace else. I could get you the car. Maybe two thousand... Five. But how can I get you out of the country? How are you gonna get out? Or were you just gonna declare it on your income tax? All right, Martin. - South America suit you? - Any place but the Canal Zone. Let's get the jewels. No. No, I can't. Not till tomorrow. Tonight, I've gotta sleep. If I can. That's right, Martin. Relax. Here. I'll show you something. That's wonderful. It is good, isn't it? I have the touch. It's only given to a few. It's a matter of knowing the currents of the body. And I waste this on fat, old women who think they can lose a few pounds and be beautiful again. Fat, old women who have too much money and too many jewels. They think the jewels make them beautiful and they fight to keep them, like they fight the years that make them ugly. Give me the key to that locker, Martin. You don't think I'd bring it with me, do you? No. I suppose not. You're too smart for that. Here. Lie down and rest a while. I'll get you a blanket. Cream and sugar? Black, both of 'em. For the love of Pete, it's four o'clock. Let's knock off. I'm sorry, Jim. Why don't you go on home? It's just a job. We'll get him. We can't miss. I wanna get him, too. He's only been out a day and already you're making a vendetta out of it. You saw his kid brother today. He thinks it's a big game. They all do. They got an idea a cop is somebody who pinches apples off a pushcart and chases kids. They make a Robin Hood out of a cheap hoodlum like that. The longer he's loose, the bigger hero he is. OK. Let's face it, we ain't Sherlock Holmeses. This is a big town. We gotta sit tight and wait for a break. Staying up all night ain't gonna help. Say, lady, why do you stay up all night? I beg your pardon? OK. No offence. Just wondered why you weren't home, getting some sleep. He's out there, somewhere. In an alley. On a roof. Looking for a way out. He's not asleep. Eat, Martin. You need the strength. I don't like to eat in the morning. Let's get going. It's only five minutes to nine. The banks aren't open yet. Have some coffee. It's good. You got a touch with that, too, huh? Yeah, I like to cook. I wanted those jewels so I could get a place in the country. Fresh eggs every day. - Milk. Cream. - Oh, stop it. How long will it take you to get the money and the tickets? Half, three-quarters of an hour. Then get 'em. Meet me on the corner of 22nd Street and 4th Avenue in 45 minutes. And don't forget - 5,000. Certainly, Martin. See that you don't lose the key to that locker. And don't use the front door. I wouldn't want to give the place a bad name. If I'd thought he was gonna kill somebody, I wouldn't have shown him. - Honest, I wouldn't. - Oh, you lying little... Shut up, Ledbetter. Orvy, did he say where he was going or anyone he was going to see? Nothing, Lieutenant. Honest, if I knew, I'd tell you. Are they gonna give me more time for this, Lieutenant? - I'm afraid so, Orvy. - They're gonna give you life! Jim! - You find out anything? - Not a thing. - What's this? - Stuff on the dames. - What? - It's a report on Rome's dames. We got all those doctors ready. You really like to play long shots. Bring some of them with you. Hey, listen, Lieutenant, this is costing me my job. Isn't there something you can do? You were in charge of the ward. There's nothing anybody can do. Come on, Sullivan. 20 years out of my life. So long, cluck! Look, Lieutenant, I wanna help you guys as much as I can. Fine. Let's go. But I got a job and I'm late now and the boss... OK, Sullivan. I'll write you a note and give you an apple for him. At 2:30 this morning, in a car on 54th Street, a man with four bullet wounds received emergency medical treatment. A licensed physician in this city is bound by the law to report any such treatment to the police. Lieutenant, if I am permitted, I speak for my colleagues. We are doctors, yes, but... I know, Doctor. I don't like this any more than you do. I realise that certain of you gentlemen have very high reputations in your own countries. However, you are not licensed to practise here and this is a murder case. Mr Sullivan. Mr Sullivan, do you recognise any of these gentlemen? Well, turn around. No, I don't think so. Rome, I'm sure of, but the other guy was in the shadows and, well, er... - I'd had a couple. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. Gentlemen, I must ask you all to show me your wallets. May I be permitted to say, sir, this is very humiliating. I'm very sorry, Doctor, but I must do it. Two hundred dollars? Where did you get this money, Doctor? Er... I... Er... Where I work, I, er... Doctor, this money came from the safe of Arthur Niles, the lawyer that Martin Rome killed yesterday. Lieutenant... I didn't know he was a murderer. I only... Come with me, Doctor. Jim, let the rest go. Over here, Doctor. Are you ready to tell me about it? Please, Lieutenant, I do not know anything about this man. I treat him, they pay me, that's all. - What about the girl, Doctor? - The girl? I do not know her. I never ask for names. She's blonde... My wife, Lieutenant... She's sick. We need money. Otherwise, I would never, never... I'm sorry. Sign this. - They put me in jail? - You knew it was against the law. We must. Fowl. - My wife, Lieutenant? - We'll do all we can. She'll be all right. Thanks. Police Headquarters. We just got the report on Teena Riconti. Two people saw a woman take her out of the apartment. Middle-aged, tall. - How about Brenda, they get her yet? - They only got the call ten minutes ago. Middle-aged, tall, blonde, a little heavy... Candella. Homicide. Yeah? Hello, Marty. - Where are you? - Trace this call. No use tracing the call, Candella. I won't be here. What's on your mind, Marty? I call you up to give you a big promotion, Candella. Well, that's very nice of you, Marty. Ah, don't get sarcastic, I'm doing you a favour. I'm giving you the woman in the DiGrazia case. You can pick her up in 20 minutes at the 18th Street subway station, on the West Side. She'll be taking the stuff out of a locker. Well, aren't you gonna thank me, Candella? No? Arrivederci. Marty? Marty? - Get somebody on that subway platform. - You think it's on the level? Sure. What do you think that Niles business was for? Come on. We'll have them radio us, that tracer call. Here it is. The key, Martin. The ticket and the money. It's on the Star of Asia, leaving Key West on Friday. If you leave tonight, you'll have plenty of time... Come on. Give me that! First, we get the jewels, Martin. Get out. I wouldn't want any monkey business, Martin. Get out. You're crazy. I'll be spotted down there. Get out. And walk just ahead of me, Martin, and don't try to get smart. You're crazy! If they spot me, they'll take you, too. Where's the locker? Don't try anything funny. You're under arrest, lady! Why that double-crossing... Let me go! Let me go! I'll kill him! I'll kill him! Lieutenant Candella? Speak to the floor nurse right there. Yes? I'm Lieutenant Collins, Homicide. I understand Lieutenant Candella has been asking for me. Asking for you? He nearly yelled the building down. We had to get the interns in to administer the sedative. He don't know when he's well off. Put me in that bed and it'd take the Fire Department to get me out. How is he? Well, he lost a lot of blood and they had to probe pretty deeply, but he'll be all right. He's probably still sleeping. We had to give him a heavy shot. - You don't look like you need one. - Sorry. Lieutenant? Lieutenant Candella? Lieutenant! - He's gone! - What do you mean, "gone"? His clothes...? Well, his hat's here, but where. Oh, that crazy...! What time did you check him last? - 4:30. I looked in. He was sleeping. - That's an hour ago! - Holy smoke! - But he just couldn't get up and walk out. - He didn't have the strength. - Oh, he didn't? You're lucky he didn't go out through that wall! Hello. Hello! Police Headquarters. What time is it now, Mother? Frances, you've asked me that four times in the last ten minutes. Mother, would you just please tell me what time it is. Well, if you're going to adopt that tone... Mother... I've been on my feet all day at the hospital and I'm in no mood to argue. If I'm getting to be a burden to you, I can always leave. She's back. There are homes for people like me and I can... Teena... Teena Riconti. - Where is she? - I... I don't know what you're talking about. You're the only one that could know where she is. Now, listen here, Lieutenant... I told you, Frances, no good would come of bringing that girl here. Mother! She's been nothing but trouble ever since she came, taking my room. All right. So I did have her here. But she doesn't know any more about that jewel robbery than I do, the poor kid. Look, Miss Pruett, Rome is a murderer, Teena is his girl. - If you ever want to see her alive again... - But... I told her not to go, I begged her, but Tony said he needed her. - Tony? - Yes. He said Marty was hurt and that he wanted to see her just once more. - He said she had to come. - Where? Oh, I don't know, to a church somewhere. - A church? - Marty had to hide until it got dark. - She's inside, Marty. - Good boy. Look, Tony, I'm gonna need you to drive. I'm taking you with me. - Marty, I don't think I ought to. - The cops scare you last night? Look, we need money and fast. You know where Mama keeps the money in the shop and the kitchen? - Oh, Marty, I can't take that. - Why not? - Well, it's all they've got. - So what? I gave it to them, didn't I? And now I need it. Get it and get back here in ten minutes. Get it, I said, and don't waste any time. I had to see you. I knew you'd come. I knew you wouldn't let me down. We're leaving, Teena, both of us. I'm taking you with me. No, Marty, no. I've got my car outside. We'll go now. Nobody can stop us. In a couple of days, we can be out of the country. We'll go away someplace and nobody will ever find us. Marty, I... I can't. There's nothing to be afraid of. They're not after you. I fixed that. Oh, it isn't that, Marty. It's you. You've changed. Changed? Why? Because of Niles? - He threatened you, Teena, I had to. - But the policeman? That was self-defence. Don't think about it now, it's gone, it's past. We'll go away and forget all about it. We'll get out of this crummy town, huh? We love each other, Teena. We can be happy, you know we can. Oh, Marty, I... I can't. It isn't right. I can't. Don't... It's all right. I understand. I shouldn't have asked you. It's just that you are the only one left. The rest don't count. Even my mother turned me out. But you, Teena, I... I've kept you in my heart, always. Wherever I went, you were my strength. Without you, I'm empty. Finished. Dead. Oh, please, Marty. - Don't torture me. - Then come with me. You're my life. I'll do anything in the world for you. - Come. - No, don't go with him. You won't need that, Marty. I came alone. She only nicked you, huh, Candella? It's too bad. I'm going out of here and she's coming with me. You maybe, Marty, but not the girl. Not when she knows about you. She knows about me. And she's coming with me. You told her, eh? A confession? This is a good place. - You told her everything? - Yeah. She knows. She knows that you killed two men. But does she know about the others? Does she know about Orvy, the poor little cracked trustie, who'll get five years for helping you break jail? Does she know about Brenda, the girl that sheltered you? She'll serve time, Marty. So will that doctor with the sick wife. You forgot all about them, didn't you? No, he didn't forget them. He didn't even think of them. He used them and brushed them aside, just like he's used everybody he's ever known. Including his own family. And he'll use you, too, if he has to. - You lie, Candella. - Do I? He says that he loves you. Maybe he does. As much as he could love anybody. But if he really loved you, would he ask you to share the kind of life he's got to live? The law doesn't want you, Teena Riconti. Go home. Teena! Not you, Marty. You're going with me. You wanna die, Candella? Here? Now? I warn you, Rome. I've got a gun, too. I've been lucky. I've never had to kill a man in my life. But I'll get you, Rome. I'll get you, because I've got to. You're bluffing. You got no gun. Go ahead. Call my bluff. You'd shoot, here in church? I think I'd be forgiven this time. Your gun, Marty. The days I've wasted, I could have been out of the country. Next time, I know better. There won't be any next time. Your gun. You're bleeding, Candella. - Sprung a leak, huh? - I'm all right. - Let's go. - She hurt you good, huh, Candella? - Let's go. - No. You oughta sit down, rest awhile, huh? In the name of the law, Rome... Stop! He's dead. I wanted to tell him I couldn't bring the money. He sent me home to get it. I couldn't take it. I wanted to tell him. Help me, Tony.
