Someone needs to stop Clearway Law. Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers. With a birdie of one, the amateur Paul McAllister is off to a big start. And that's the number four handicap hold Jim. Now let's see if he can keep it up. How about this? He's just gone back-to-back at the start of this round. I don't know who this guy is, but this is starting to get a little bit interesting isn't it? Who else has come on to the scene like this out of nowhere and played, just lights out? That's a great question, Brandon Grace maybe, at the 2017 Open, kind of comes to mind. Johnny Miller, Bobby Jones? All right, Szoke, let's go out to the course and follow our unlikely leader. Gloria Ruben is out there with him. Well, gentlemen, when a golfer is having a round like this, we say he's playing unconscious. McAllister, I don't think he has a pulse. Jim, how is it that we have never heard of this guy? No idea, to our viewers, we have frantically searched everywhere for his resume. He owns a large corporation, but we can't find where he plays, what country club, his pro, anything about him. I mean, this is a phenom from nowhere. We all know this is a Pro-Am, but I'll bet there are some pros out there that wouldn't wanna play against this guy. Well, amen to that. And now the final hole from, Mr. McAllister, can he do it? Can he complete the perfect round of golf? I mean, Jim, good Lord, all birdies. This should be just a tap in. Gloria, you're down there, what do you see with this putt? Just has to get it to the hole. Jim, my two-year old can make this with her Lego putter. Szoke, Gloria, what is that humming sound I'm hearing? It sounds like a... It sounds like a- Have a good day Mr. McAllister. This is all your fault. How come you didn't wake me up? Sir, your phone was set on do not disturb. Well, you could have called the hotel, and where's the map program? This car does not have a map program. I don't know where I'm going, Harriet. I mean, how much are we paying for this car? Harriet- It doesn't have a map program? Come on, and I can't find my sunglasses either. Have you tried looking on your head? Paul, Ted here, we're tracking you. All right, at the next intersection make a left. Left? Left now, left now. Did you say left? Cue video, roll video. You forgot to eat lunch again? No, I remember quite well choosing not to eat lunch. Thank you. Anything else? Oh, your son, Jake, won his regional motocross tournament today. That's great, put it in the company newsletter. I sent him your congratulations. Oh good. And now, welcome to the stage, the man behind it all, Paul McAllister. Showtime. Go get 'em. Thank you, thank you. So are you pumped? Come on, you can do better than that. I said, are you pumped? That's more like it, that is the McAllister spirit. So, no. This is not the latest picture from my, my last vacation. This is the next phase of growth at McAllister international. The big Kahuna, Asia, where 80% of all the world's e-commerce takes place. This is where stronger distribution relationships are going to be built for McAllister to become a dominant e-commerce force worldwide. So how do we accomplish this? We must remember our core values. Which are: Performance, perfection, profit. That's how we win. That's how we win. Cut to the motocross video. Are you sure? I thought Paul and his son were a little, estranged? Nah, he'll love it. Roll video. Ooh, what a move McAllister just made, Jake's taking the lead. And he pulls past the pack, McAllister wins! Yes, that's my son. Thank you, very proud, very proud. That just goes to show that we're still a family company. All right, please sit, sit. You know, it's hard to believe that just 9 years ago, we were working out of a tiny storefront in a strip mall. South Park, representing. George was there, so was Bob, and Harriet. Many of the quality producers that we are gonna be targeting in Asia have well established supply chains, and deep relationships with some of our competitors. But not to worry, because we have the right team player on board to get us there. Please help me welcome to the stage, our new Chief Operating Officer, Ted Styron. Ted here, he has extensive e-commerce experience throughout Southeast Asia, great relationships, and a ridiculous track record of success. Thanks, Paul. And I am truly humbled to be in this position and getting to work alongside each and every one of you. You've accomplished so much, but I expect even more from the McAllister team. I think with the right moves and the right deals, we can be serious competitors in these new markets in the very near future. I don't know, those are some pretty lofty goals, Ted. Isn't that what you guys are all about? I've been around, and I've heard your mantra. It's only worth it... If you earn it. Welcome aboard, Ted. Now everybody, thank you for being brilliant. Now go enjoy the rest of the program because you earned it, but tomorrow go make some money. By the way, I set you up in a Pro-Am charity golf tournament. You did? What's the upside? Heavy hitter coming in from Asia, Chaos Wong. Wong's Manufi right? Right, one of the largest producers in the region, you get to meet a tour player, play a round of golf on national television, and connect us to Chao. The $20 billion man. Not bad, Ted, you're off to a good start. Woo. I can't believe you won. Oh, come on, mom. You can't? I mean, if, if I hadn't hit that double, just right, going into that rut, I never would've made it. Like, that was a crazy finish. Oh honey, I am so proud of you. Thanks. Get up here. Ooh, yeah. Is that Meatloaf? - You know it is. - Yes, I'm starving. - Good. Because I made plenty. So, did you hear from your dad? No, but Harriet sent a great e-card pretending to be him. We got any ketchup? - Yeah. Heads up. I heard they played your race at his event. Oh, I bet that went over big. - Actually, I heard it did. I mean with Paul. He's still your father. My small group is meeting here tonight. If you're here, you're welcome to drop by. - Your women's group? - Yeah. And you guys pray for, dad or me? Mm, Hmm. Yeah, no thanks, Mom. Mom, it's, it's been what, 4 or 5 years, something like that? God's warranty on dad coming back has expired. I'm just, I'm just sick of seeing you get let down. Jake, look, your dad is just, he's complicated. - No, he's not. He's married to his business. I'm, I'm moving on, just like he did. You should too. Love you, Mom. - Oh, I love you too. Jake. Yeah? Cookies. Definitely want those. Hey? What would it take for you to forgive him? If he made these as good as you. Right, here we go. Here we go, here we go. I can't believe this. Someone give this man a single malt, geez. You guys want to know what the sweetest sound of golf is? It's this. The sound of cash going in my pocket. Unreal. I just got my pairing for the Pro-Am tournament. Yeah, who is it? Tom Lehman. Tom Lehman, are you serious? That's gonna be tough for you Paul, playing with a pro. You sure you know how to handle it? I don't care, it's business. Plus it's a charity event. What's the charity? Me, I'm the charity. Here, here. Left now, left now. Did you say left? Okay, in 2 miles, you're gonna make a right, and there should be some signs. Okay, I got it, thanks. Hit 'em straight partner. Most importantly, connect us with Chao Wong. That's your entire purpose for being there. Will do. Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the Currahee Club, the host of this years exciting Currahee Pro-Am Charity Golf Classic, benefiting College Golf Fellowship and the Payne Stewart Golf Camps. In honor of the legacy of Mr. Stewart, we ask that you- - Hey, where do I check in? - All remove your hats. - Come on, come on, man. I got a tee time. Let's go. Mr. McAllister, thank goodness, we've been looking for you. Your start time is in less than 10 minutes. 10 Minutes, no, no, no, that's impossible. You're gonna have to make some accommodations. My alarm, look, look it doesn't matter, but I gotta hit balls, I gotta warm up- - No Sir, I'm sorry. Unless you wanna forfeit the tournament, you have to go to the first tee right now. Are you kidding me? Man. Let's go, come on. Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the Currahee Club. - How you guys feeling? - Eh. You'll be fine, but don't forget to breathe, okay? Hey Tom, Paul McAllister, it's an honor. - Hey Paul, good to see you. - Yeah, yeah. Hey everyone, we're gonna have a great day. Before we start though, I wanna say that we're playing golf today for two great causes. One is College Golf fellowship, which has been a part of my life for a long, long time. The other is the Payne Stewart Golf Camps, and we have some kids who take part here today. They use golf to teach kids about life. So everything we're doing is to support kids like this, so keep that in mind. Let's have a great time today. Thanks for being here. Beautiful day for golf, Tom. Please welcome to the tee, former number 1 rank golfer in the world, winner of the 1996 Open Championship- Yeah, we got lucky with the weather. The only golfer in history- You ever play one of these things? Hold on, hold it. The player of the year honor on all 3 PGA tours, ladies and gentlemen, Tom Lehman. Good shot. Next on the team, Keith Beckman. This whole TV crew thing makes me nervous. Yeah, just get through the first hole, you won't even think about it. Good shot. Rusty Williams. Welp, here goes nothing. Beauty. Aw, hold on, hold on, hold on. - Great shot. - Bunch of hacks. Paul McAllister. Paul, the best spot to hit today is right center of the fairway. The wind will help you get you set up for the dogleg. You know what? I don't need your advice. Just carry my bag and hand me the club that I ask for, and we'll get along just fine. Whatever you say, Sir. Didn't give me any time to warm up. ♪ Day comes, do you walk on through ♪ ♪ I'm taking it all away ♪ ♪ Their taking it all away ♪ ♪ Time to relive all you thought you knew ♪ ♪ 'Cause their taking it all away ♪ ♪ Their taking it all away ♪ ♪ Head is spinning ♪ ♪ Legs all start to shake ♪ ♪ Your left wondering ♪ ♪ How did it get this way ♪ No worries, Paul, don't think about the cameras. ♪ There's a man right in front of me ♪ ♪ Takin' it all away ♪ ♪ He's takin' it all away ♪ Be right, be right, please be right. Money. Finally. After what one could only call an abysmal 8 holes, McAllister finally has a good look at a birdie here. With his handicap, it would mean a much needed eagle for his team. What's wrong with you, you're better than this, this is not what you came for. Get yourself together, Paul. Well, for those of you watching at home, we'd like to show you the technique behind amateur Paul McAllister's club break. First you grasp the end solidly. Grip is everything. Then apply the pressure at just the right moment. There, perfect separation. I'm not sure his sponsors will enjoy this notoriety. - Yeah, but hey, they spell your name right, right? His follow up toss, also merits mention. Oh, high marks for that throw, yes. Indeed. Let's get back to our leaders, the Wong family. Get in the hole. Oh, yeah. Hey Rusty, why don't you guys go ahead and hit, we'll catch up with you. - Okay. - All right? Hey there, Paul, you know, we haven't even talked this whole front 9. Sorry Tom, I'm a little preoccupied not doing so well. Yeah, well we all have bad days. I'm sure we have. Yeah, yeah, but you know, that thing about the putter, you're just not good enough to get that mad. Let's talk after the round. You know, my dad always told me that the game of golf and life have a lot in common. That the way you act on a golf course often reflects the way that you live your life. Well, I always heard the game was called golf because all the other four letter words were taken. Whoa. That's true. Hey Paul, there is somebody here who I'd love for you to meet. He was a friend of my dad's. He's had a huge influence on me, my entire life, both on and off the golf course, his name is Will Dunn. He's a member here. Most folks, they just call him the old pro. So do me a favor, have a chat with him. Yeah, I guess I can do that. Tell him I sent ya. - I will, thanks Tom. - Yep. Anybody have an extra putter I can borrow? I do. Hey, I'm looking for a man they call, the old pro. That'd be Mr. Dunn, Sir, Will Dunn. He's in his usual spot on the veranda. Are you the old pro? Well, I am old. Paul McAllister from Atlanta, Tom Lehman sent me. Oh, help me up. Ah, good. Got time for a Mint Julep? No, thanks. How about a nice Arnold Palmer? Uh, yeah, sure. Yes, sir. Let's sit down. Well, what can I do for you, Paul? Not sure, exactly. Although I did just play the worst round of golf I've played in years, maybe ever. I even lost 2 balls on the putting green. Well, if you're here for golf lessons, there's a lot better pros to learn from than me. Tom was pretty specific I find you. What did you do out there Paul, that caused Mr. Lehman to send you my way? Oh, I, sort of, had an equipment failure, then things got worse. Oh, well, where do you see yourself? Excuse me? Not just in golf, but you know your whole existence, your life, who you are. What are you? Some sort of all-knowing enigmatic guru type guy? Well, I like that, but I don't think it would fit my business card. Hey, I'm sorry, I, I gotta go business calls. Nice meeting you. Oh, okay. Call me. When you decide to get serious. Mr. Wong, Paul McAllister. - See you at the club. - Okay. Mr. McAllister, I'm aware of you and your company. This is my daughter Shin, and my son Lijung. It's a pleasure. Your family, are they here with you? No, unfortunately they couldn't make it. I'd like to meet them someday. Sure, we can all hope for that. Would you have time to talk about some business ideas I have? Sure, after I meet your family. Hey Harriet, I'm gonna stay in Currahee another day. So change my flight, and I need you to set an appointment for me, a man named Will Dunn. Hey, have you guys seen Will? Forget it. Hey Paul, come on, we're burning daylight. Let's go. I guess you're driving- Fortunate people we are Paul. Not everyone gets to golf in places like this. Ooh, this car has remarkable handling. I'm glad you're enjoying it, it rents for 500 a day. Woo, hoo, does that include insurance? I hear they really get you for insurance. When was the last time you drove like this? Ah, 20 years ago, I guess. Back when I still had my license. ♪ Smoke on the water ♪ ♪ Fire in the sky ♪ Ah, a muni? Yeah, my Dads best buddy Donald, designed this course, 1927. Yeah, I think you'll like it. Uh, I got a rash the last time I played a muni. Ah. No, no, no, no, no, no, put those clubs back. You're not gonna need 'em right now. I watched the highlights of you on the 9th green, and we got a few other things to cover today. So how do you see yourself? You know guru, you already asked me that. What do you mean see yourself? Well, when you look in the mirror, when you're shaving, brushing your teeth, doing your morning ritual, what do you see? I see the man I've always wanted to be. Any regrets? Can't afford to spend time on things that create a weak mental state. What about your personal life? Business is good. - Business? - Mm, hmm. Tell me about your family. Wow, you know, you're the second person this week who's hit me with this family stuff. I mean, what is with you guys? Ouch. Okay. I have a son who hates me, and my wife and I have been separated for about 5 years. Sounds like your game could use a mulligan. A mulligan? You mean like a golf mulligan? A mulligan, yeah. The mulligan was first used sometime in the 1930s, during a round at the Wing Foot Golf Club in New York. Dave Mulligan had arrived by automobile for a round of golf with friends, and had traversed a very rickety bridge. He was quite literally rattled, subsequently he completely muffed his tee shot. He begged his friends for a do-over, and although, this was probably not the first mulligan ever granted, a practice completely contrary to the rules of golf of course, it was memorialized, and would forever be associated with his namesake. Thanks for the history lesson but I never liked mulligans. Fair enough. With all the things you could do, why do you play golf? I've always enjoyed the game. Hmm, play a lot as a kid? Yes, yes. My father introduced me to the game. You have a good relationship with your father? Bottom of the 8th inning, and so far it's been a very tough game. Move, move, move. - Um, can you help- - Hold on, hold on, hold on. - A double play. - Ah, dang it. - What, what is it? - It's long division. All right, here's our answer, right? You're gonna write that answer down and make sure it's barely legible, okay? Now, now this is the most important part right here, you paying attention? Two smaller numbers, you put 'em right there. And you get, like, a minus sign, you gotta remember, they can't be able to read it at all. And that, is a guaranteed pass, my boy. But I really wanna learn how to do it. I'm teaching you how to survive, son. But, but you can't cheat. You have to follow the rules. - Well, fine then. Do whatever you gotta do. Good luck with it, good luck with life. I'm gonna be better than you. What's that? Taking a mulligan is cheating. That's why I've always hated mulligans. Does that look like a chariot to you? What, in the clouds? I've always thought it'd be so cool. If God would take me home in a flaming chariot like the prophet Elijah. These days, I seem to be taking a closer look than usual. Are you sure you don't wanna, just hit a few putts? Oh, I think we've accomplished quite a bit today, don't you? Ah, I see, well, it certainly was a beautiful day Hey, would you take me by my office on the way back? As long as I'm driving. Okay. Paul, I give these to people who might, emphasis, might have a chance at getting their game back in shape. A journal? You can call it that if you'd like, I even started it for you. List your solid shots on the left, and your mulligans on the right. Keep asking yourself where you see yourself, not just in golf, but in life. In fact, make an assessment of your life every day, and acknowledge the errors you may be making and then correct them. And you think this might help. Come back and see me in a few weeks, and bring that fancy pants car with you, I like it. What do you mean it hit the target price but we didn't buy? Automate it if you have to Gary, it's not a suggestion. How do you think our company grows exponentially? Correct, through mergers and acquisitions, that's where you come in. So when I tell you to set a target price for a significant portion of a competitor stock, what do you do? Right answer, now buy the shares and no mulligans allowed. Of course I'm gonna wait. Thanks. - Mr. Freeman's on line 2. I'll have to get back to him. Talk to me, Gary. Paul? Now watch it, if it drops in the next 5 days, I want you to double our position. Yeah, I hope she gets well soon, but Gary don't ever second guess me again, are we clear on that? Good. So how'd you play? Well, I guess you didn't see the highlight reel. Chao and his kid won the tournament, yeah, I saw that, and yes I heard about the hole. You made ESPN, which is why I thought you might need one of these. Reinforced carbon graphite, nearly unbreakable. Wow. Should eliminate some temptations. So, Chao. Did you meet him, how'd it go? Yeah, briefly. He seemed more interested in my family than our company. Think it'll pay off? It might, but he's definitely gonna need some courting. Gotcha. I'll tell you what, why don't you go ahead and prepare some projections. Done. Oh, Hey. How about you and I get some drinks soon? My girlfriend Beth has a smoking hot friend. Eh, that's the last thing I need right now. My life's complicated enough. Just drinks? All right, don't make a decision now, but don't make plans for Friday at 6. Food, right. Ah, where would I be without you? Ah, skinny or dead? How was your golf lesson? Enlightening. Oh, good. Harriet, um, have you seen Rebecca this week? Every Monday. Oh, that's right. What do you, what do you ladies talk about when you're together? Well, it's a life group, so we, we talk and we pray. We even pray for you. How's she doing? She's your wife, Paul, maybe you should ask her sometime. It's, it's no secret that she misses you terribly. Question is, do you miss her? Let me guess, book a flight to Currahee? Paul, this is not finished. Did you, did you forget to write in the solid shot side? This reads like an obituary. Look, Will, I'm picking it up at my pace, so either meet me where I'm at or we shouldn't be meeting. Fair enough. But if you're expecting a cakewalk the bakery's down the street. Woo. Are you kidding me? You're not even watching, that was an amazing shot. I don't have to see a good shot, I can hear it. Oh, so what do you hear about my game? Oh, your game, well, I think your game of life is in the bigger mess. Stop glaring at me. Look, here's what you gotta do. You've got to start your day visualizing a perfect outcome. Stretch back, meditate in the morning, and then see the scenery, enjoy the scenery, to create a perfect mental state before you ever get to the golf course. See you start with the little things, get 'em right, before you get to the big ones. Well, at least we're finally talking about golf. Oh, think so? Oh, so now you're gonna tell me that the reason I'm separated from my wife is actually a result of the little things I wasn't paying attention to, hmm? Just trying to hell help you with your warmups. What time is our tee time? Tomorrow morning, 10:00 AM, at the muni. Tomorrow? What am I even warming up for? Well, I think we made some real progress today, don't you? See you tomorrow at 10, Lord willing. You know, I've got better things to do with my life. Oh, I know, you're a big shot. This was a good lesson, wasn't it? It was excellent. - And just go on to lesson 12- - Hey, Jake. Hey, Jake. Come on in here, you girls all remember Jake, right? Of course, how's it going. Hello, yeah, hi ladies, I'm just, I'm just passing through. I'm gonna get some- Oh, well we're just getting to the most important stuff. What do we need to be praying about? I'm, I'm good, really, like, thank you- I mean, everyone has to have one thing. Oh, well I, I, I do have this. I mean, I have this big race coming up. Uh, it's a huge race. If he wins, he gets us to nationals. Wow, okay, congratulations. - Thanks. Get in here, this is very exciting, come on, I wanna hear all about it, it's very exciting, I wanna hear about it. - There's chocolate. - Come on, baby boy, come on. Yeah, there's chocolate, come on. And then, uh, okay now, let me check this grip, yeah, that's good, good. Bend, just a little bit, okay? All right. Okay golfers, swing away. Good, Dianna, don't worry about it, just tee it up and hit it again. Eddie, loosen the grip on your club, son. You're not strangling a chicken. Hey, glad to see you, Paul, ready to play? We're gonna finally play a round of golf today, huh? Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, oh guys, keep your heads still, all of you. Marcus, can you come over Marcus? Yes, sir. I want you to meet Marcus, he's a, he's a student of mine here at the Payne Stewart Golf Camp, and a fine young golfer. We've been together about what, 2, 3 years? 4, Sir. 4 years? Time flies when you're having fun, and you and he are gonna play a round today. And, hey, try it, I'll be your caddie. Marcus, get ready to have your butt handed to you. Pleasure to meet you too then, Sir. Have fun guys. Tees all yours Marcus. Oh, Sir, age before beauty. No, I insist. All right. Not bad. ♪ My, mama always said I was born for this ♪ ♪ And some people wouldn't like that I was different ♪ Ah, this is gonna be fun. ♪ How hard it would be ♪ ♪ 'Cause she filled me with love and the strength to lead ♪ ♪ She said, ooh ♪ ♪ That kids a flame, said ooh ♪ ♪ That kids a flame ♪ ♪ He's gonna burn something down if you get in his way ♪ ♪ I came to light it up ♪ Uh, oh.

You were losing before you even got to the course today. You know, no fault of yours Marcus, you played exceptionally well, but I can't do this anymore. So I'm not perfect. What was that? You heard me, I'm not even in the same league as you guys. Well, maybe we should just give him a break. We got a lovely set of pings here. Give them to charity. What about this card you tore up on the green? Now can we talk a second? There's nothing left to say, Will. Oh, oh yes there is. Let's just play a different game. Well I'm sure he is an expert at that too, no thanks. Well that may be, but hear me out. Let's play the back 9 holes with NATO golf. NATO golf? NATO, N-A-T-O, not attached to outcome. That means you can forget about the scorecard, which I remind you, you just tore up anyway. And then you and Marcus can just set your own pars for each hole on the back 9. Okay, let me get this straight, if I want to eagle a par 3, I should make it a par 5? If you want to you, you just visualize each hole the way you'd like to play it, then set your own par for ways when you're playing it naturally or your, your best game. So lower my expectations. Will, I fire people for having low expectations. Do you think he has a chance? Welp, I mean he's teachable. Teachable? Okay. A, a 7? Shut up kid. Hey, let's have fun. ♪ I came to light it up ♪ Beauty, beautiful, beautiful. Let me see if I can get a birdie now. ♪ Light it up ♪ ♪ Light it up ♪ All right, parred it well. Well, well, well, well, was it fun after all? I wouldn't say fun, sometimes enjoyable. I think you both show great promise. You know, Paul, that's the first time I saw you smile on the golf course. Yes, thank you for that. I had to laugh to hold the tears back. I was 2-over, even on my par. You know, the game of golf was meant to be fun. And the more fun you have, the more successful you are. Ah. Thank you. You know, you mentioned being successful. I've accomplished a lot in my life, but it's not enough. Mm. I flip to that mulligan's page every morning, and I write the same thing. Have you ever needed a mulligan on something big but you knew you couldn't get it? Oh yeah. Yes. I had a son. We had him for 2 years. My wife, Emily and I went out on a date. We left our little boy with the babysitter, and I was eating my favorite dessert, a custard, when I stopped in mid-bite, and I, I felt deep sadness just sweep over me. Like my soul was crying out, I, I knew something was wrong. So, Emily drove us home. We found that our little boy had somehow slipped out of the house and the babysitter was looking for him. I found him in the neighbors pool, pale, lifeless. I can't describe the feeling of loss when I pulled my little boy outta the water. Paramedics came, they couldn't help. I put his cold little cheek next to mine, wanting so to hear him breathing, like I always could when he was in the room with us, I could not believe it was real. And I felt the love of God surround me as if to say it's not my fault. My son, and now recently, my wife. And I'm supposed to believe in you? How can you even be real? What kind of God allows his people to suffer so much pain? I don't get it. America no? What's up? Duty calls. Do you have to get that? You have no idea. Ted, I got one question for you. Are you making progress? I received the preliminary contract today. And McAllister has no clue? That we're only using Chao's company as bait, no clue. Besides, he's involved in some golf self-help thing anyway, just need to really move to get the deal done before Chao signs the contract. Your sure we covered all our tracks? Chao's notoriously thorough, if he notices Beyonsun's even in the mix, he will back out. Leave it to me. I'll let you know when everything's in place. Hey, everybody, welcome to the motocross regional semifinals in the Mercedes-Benz stadium, all racers scheduled for the first race, please make your way inside. Hey, your bike's looking really good there, Jake. You nervous? Mom, don't, don't do that, okay I... You're gonna do great. Thanks Mom. So your dad's not gonna be able to make it, he's not- Mom, I okay, I know he is not gonna come right, please just, I love you, but none of this helps me right now, you're just stressing me out. Okay. So I'll just, I'll be in the stands if you need me, okay? - Yeah. - Go team Jake. Racers are lined up, and ready to go. Go Jake! We're ready for you, Paul. Okay. Mr. Wong, you remember Paul McAllister, from the Charity Pro-Am Tournament. Hello, Paul, we did meet briefly. You made quite the highlight reel on 9. Yeah, it's not my finest moment, but congratulations on your win. We were honored to be a part of it. It's an annual event for my kids and me. Excellent. So how can we do business together? Your COO, has made an interesting proposal. I trust you share his enthusiasm? Absolutely, Ted has our best interest at heart, or should I say our mutual interest. Based on my own calculations, those numbers seem a little broad and overzealous, but I do see that the relationship could be mutually beneficial. We aren't overestimating Mr. Wong. You can have a larger footprint in North America, and we would love to partner with you in Asia. As a matter of fact, we see even more potential in the future. Go ahead and send us your projections and we can adjust them as needed. I'll have my lawyers draft up terms for you by the end of the week if you're ready to move. You know, Paul, I know just about everything there is to know about your company. Everything checks out, but for some reason, it just doesn't feel right yet. This isn't about the putter, is it? Send the terms, and we'll see what happens. Okay, thank you everybody. I think that went well. He's ready to come on board. That's not what I heard. Men like Chao need cultivating. They're never a one-call close. Ready to go to the Manchester? Yeah, I suppose, I'll meet you there. McAllister's fighting to regain the lead. Oh, oh, oh, and McAllister collide. And McAllister is down. No. Jake! McAllister is hit. Pile up on the track, and the EMT's are on their way. Sir, can you hear me? You're okay buddy, you're gonna be fine. Just so you know, Paul is technically my boss, for now. Is he wearing any jewelry? I don't know. He's been separated for something like, 5 years. So I'd say he's fair game. Hey. There's the man of the hour, Paul McAllister. Paul this is Beth, she's with me. Hello. And this is, Carla. - Hey, nice to meet you both. - You too. Oh, Atlanta traffic was, you know, pretty rough. We killed the whole bottle of champagne, would you like something? Oh. I like the Chateauneuf-du-Papet, it's really complex, but it's so smooth. That's, that's a good choice, I was thinking the same thing. Yeah, put that degree to use. Oh, I haven't worked this hard since I was in North Korea. Sir, I'm so sorry to interrupt, but your phone keeps going off in your coat pocket. I thought it might be important. Oh, no, thank you, I didn't even realize I left it. I, I'm sorry, it must be an emergency. What do you mean? Can't, can't it wait? I gotta go. He never even touched his wine. I never said he was normal. More wine for us? What's wrong? Weren't you watching the race? Yeah, I caught the first half, did he win? Jake is at Samaritan hospital. He's in the ER. What, what happened? He flipped his bike. They're still doing tests, I don't know how serious it is. Okay, I'm on my way. Paul, I am so scared. I know, I know, I, I'll get there as soon as I can. - Thank you. - Yes, Sir. Becca, Have you seen him? I'm so sorry it took me so long to get here. McAllister? Yes, over here. I'm Dr. Allen, would you come with me please? Sure. The surgery went very well. Surgery? Jake's right ankle joint was completely shattered and dislocated. We were able to fuse the ankle into a functional position. His clavicle, here, the collar bone, although not broken, still suffered severe trauma, but will heal with rest and immobilization. Those are the fixable things we can do now. Fixable? He's also had a concussion, we don't know how severe, and we'll test for that over the next few days. I'm estimating your son's physical injuries will take 6 to 8 weeks to fully heal. But with modern concussion protocols, well, you don't wanna have too many of those. But he's gonna be okay, right, I mean, he's gonna recover? The neurologist will have more to say in the next few days. He'll need some hands on care for the next couple of months, the nurse will give you instructions on discharge. When can we see him? We'll I'll come and get you when he is ready. - Thank you. - Thank you, doctor. Who are you texting right now? My small group, I'm just giving them updates. They've been praying for the past few hours. Mr. And Mrs. McAllister. Yes? You can see him now. And although he's coming too, he'll still be sedated to some extent. There's my boy. Did you see that Mom? I was going to win. Yeah, I know. I am so glad you're okay. If this is okay, I would hate to be not okay. You terrified me? I'm still here. Code blue, 602. Oh, why are you hear? I hate you, why are you... I know. Now I'm crying. I love you, Jake. You know that time I had drugs in my room and, and you caught me with them, remember that? No. Of course not, because, because you weren't there. Hey, Jake. These drugs are better. I'm just gonna go to sleep. Okay, hey, I Love you. I love you too, Mom. Oh, that didn't go too well. You just have to give it time. I'm willing to do that more than anything. That's good then, now you'll have your chance. What do you mean, I don't get it? He's staying with you. He's staying with, staying with me? No, no way Rebecca. How am I gonna look after someone who clearly hates my guts? You'll find a way Paul, you always seem to. But he already lives with you in our big, beautiful house. I have to work, and the house, that was your arrangement if you recall. Okay, but this means I'm gonna have to spend a lot of time with him. - Exactly. You're serious? I'll drop in and check in on you two every now and then, and if you need any help at all, don't hesitate. And I mean you, not Harriet. Thanks. Good to see you too. Wait, I only have a 1 bedroom apartment. How's this gonna work? Okay, we've got everything known to man, and that man could ever want. Chips, salsa, guacamole, beer, Gatorade, cheese, garlic summer sausage, 5 kinds of pizza, orange chicken, and lots of ice cream. And none of that nonfat kind of stuff. Just had the TV installed yesterday. All the sports channels are programmed in. You got gaming, streaming, the works. Okay, and in here is your room. Wow, nice, nice. It's a early Bed Bath and Beyond decor, right? Right it, isn't this, isn't this your room, Dad? It is, but it's yours for now. Couch will be fine for me. Man, there's so much I want to talk to you about, I almost don't know where to start. Well, I know where to start. I'm crashing here until I get better, and then I'm outta here. Jake, look. You're in my room. Dad? Yep? Can you come in here please? I need, I need your help. - Dad? - What's up? - I can't look down. - What? I just, I need you to spot me. - Spot you? - Yeah, can you come in here and grab me by the waist, please? Yeah. Okay, so sound of water, good, no sound, bad. Okay, don't, don't worry, I got you. Not now. Jake? Hey Becca, it's Paul, we're, uh- - Not a good time now, Mom. Are, are you two still hanging in there? Not a good choice of words, Mom. - Hey Harriet. - Hello, Paul. Just to confirm I moved everything Yes, did you talk to Ted about it? He seems very willing to fill in. Why do you keep answering phones? I don't know, it's a reflex. - Hey Harriet. - Hey Rebecca. Dad, I think I got this. Sounds good, holler if you need me. Oh, you're with Jake, well, okay, that was all. Well, wait, Harriet, can you pick up some drinks? I'm out. Sure thing, see your later. Guys, can you shop another time please? Okay, bye. Bye, Harriet. Jake, I'll be coming by on Wednesday to pick you up for your doctor's visit. I'll check my calendar, Mom. Jake, is Paul there? No. Okay, I'll see you then. Cage match? Oh yeah. Can I, can I, um, can I join you? Sure, please. Dad, got it. - Oof. - Oh, that was brutal. Yeah, that was almost as bad as my wreck. Mysterio has been locked in a jail cell, and an animal is his cell mate. Hey, Dad? Yeah? Why did you leave mom? That's, that's complicated. I remember one night during an argument looking at your mom and it just, it just felt like we were strangers. I mean, certainly not the same people we were when we got married. I mean, you remember how much we were fighting. No Dad. That's BS, and you know it, if you put nearly as much effort into us as you- Now, you're starting to sound like... Look you have no idea, how much I sacrificed to provide for our family. Yeah, well, some things aren't worth sacrificing. ♪ I think I'm finally seein' all that I've been missing ♪ ♪ I've got a lot to say but I wouldn't blame you ♪ ♪ If you didn't want to listen ♪ ♪ Because love is easy ♪ ♪ Until it gets hard ♪ ♪ It'd be nice to start again, wouldn't it ♪ ♪ Hi, what's your name ♪ ♪ Do you come here a lot ♪ ♪ I know I ♪ ♪ Don't deserve a second chance ♪ ♪ I'll try anyway ♪ ♪ And in time you might find that I've changed ♪ Good morning.

Dinner with the rep from Car am Pharmaceuticals tonight, and lunch with Lindel Plastics tomorrow. Are you okay? Yeah, yeah, I'm fine. What's next? Yes. A very attractive young lady dropped by earlier with that. I can explain. I'm sure you can. Oh, Harriet, push the rest of my week to next week. I'm going to Currahee tomorrow morning. This isn't about golf, is it? Said every woman to every man throughout history. I heard that. And for good reason. Hey, this is not what you think. Whatever you say, you're the boss. Paul, there he is, good to have you back. - Hey Ted. - How's Jake? He's doing well, it's just a pit stop, but thank you for holding down the fort. This place practically runs itself. I have a new idea for us though. What's this? I was contacted by a company in Korea, Beyonsun. I knew 'em from my time in Asia. They're small to mid-size, but they're significant players in the east. I think we should seriously consider buying them out to gain access to their relationships. All right, I'm listening. Well, they wanna merge, but we will retain primary ownership. This is an acquisition. And they know that? Okay. Have legal look into it. I wouldn't have brought this to you if I hadn't already done that. I presented them in favorable terms, favorable to us, and favorable to Beyonsun. I thought they would counter, but they didn't, they agreed. Just waiting for you approval. How long have I been gone? And this, this is not gonna jeopardize our relationship with Chao Wong in any way? I don't see how strengthening our position can do anything but help. Okay, I'll get back to you. All right, your mom should be here soon to take you to the doctor, and she'll be looking in on you for the rest of the week. So no cage fighting. You should, you should hang and say hi to her. Nah, I don't think she's expecting to see me. All right, see you in a couple days, bud. - Bye, Dad. - Bye. - Oh. - Oh. - Hey. - Hey. I'm sorry, I thought you were gone. I'm about to be. Oh, what do you have there? - Chocolate chip cookies. - Yes. Do you want one for your trip? - Love one. - Okay. Those, those are mine, Dad. So is this a work trip or? Mm, kinda, sorta, I mean, not exactly. - Oh, okay. - No, no Becca, it's not like that. Awkward. What am I supposed to think Paul? You may think this has been easy for me, it hasn't. I can't even think about moving on. Truth is, at the moment all I can think about is mulligans. - What? - What? Thanks for the help. Those are my cookies, Dad, no, don't let him take- I'll make you more. Okay. Starting slowly, huh, Paul? You gotta take care of the little things. Get the big things right. Now you got it. Hey, can I invoke the most sacred words in any language? Which are? Tee time. Let's go play a perfect round, okay? Now you're talking. Where are your clubs, old pro? Ah, you noticed? You know, golf was not meant to be played alone. I'll explain, hop in. Back in the day, every golfer had a companion. Someone who knew the course, and could advise you in each situation, maybe not get you out of trouble, but Today that person is called the caddie. And that's how the game of golf was meant to be played. Paul, today I am your caddie. Okay, friend, one new rule for today's round. Anytime you want to take a mulligan, take it. Say that again? Take a mulligan for any shot you want driver, chip, put- I'm sorry, old pro, but that's not my style. We've been over this. I play by the rules or I don't play. Well, if you insist. Oh, any other advice on this first hole, caddie? Yes, hole number 1, long par 5, into the wind, everything plays to the right, so first shot placement is essential. I think I'd use my 3-iron because the driver's a little too risky for this. Okay, okay, did you not see how well I was hitting this bad boy on the range? Yes, I did. Well, good. Watch and learn. Awful shot, terrible, absolutely terrible, the wind took it, who knew? Okay. Stupid mulligan. Well, which one you want to use? Oh, like that's a question. You made the rules, I'm gonna take advantage of them. Ah. You know, I re-watched the video of your game, and you hit a lot of sand shots. Mulligan? Not bad. Oh, I'm pretty good, aren't I? Well, that mulligan guy sure is. Well, I like him right now, but they're still against the rules. Well, you gotta ask yourself who wrote those rules? The sport of golf was invented sometime in the middle ages when fortified Scottish people took to turns hitting a small object into a rabbit warren. The game soon developed into a worldwide obsession with certain strict rules, governed by an austere group known as the Royal and ancients. And if anything has remained exactly the same about the game from time immemorial, it is this, every stroke counts. You know, you've been especially chipper since I saw you last, how have you been? - A lot's happened, My son- - Jake? Good memory, yeah Jake was in a motorcycle crash during a race. He's moved in with me to recover. Yes, God is good. Well, I'm not sure how Jake's near death, career-ending crash is good. Look, last time we were together. You asked me how you could get life mulligans, right? So I asked God to give you one. And now you're telling me your son has miraculously moved in with you. Oh, so it's your fault? Well, sometimes God uses seemingly bad things for good. I'm living proof of that. No, I'm not sure I like his methods. I'm sure the feeling's mutual. I like it, Paul, I like it. Oh, boy. There it is. Am I a great coach or not? You? Did you not see who just made that putt? I tip my Tam to you, Sir. You have the honor of going to retrieve your birdie putt. Thank you sir. Way to go. Thank you. It's been a hard couple of weeks, but now I'm talking to him, I'm in his life, and I wouldn't have it any other way. Hello? Old pro? We gotta take time to thank God for the good things he does for us. Look, Will, I know a lot of religious people, they attribute seemingly unexplained coincidences to God, and I'm not convinced there is a God, much less one who cares. Listen, you may not know him, he knows you. He created you, and he very deeply loves you. Now you're starting to sound like my wife. I mean, my soon to be ex, Becca. What is this church? No, this is not church, this is A cathedral. I have to admit, you are a master at reading putts. Well, that's why they call me the old pro. You know, I offered you those unlimited mulligans out there for fun, and, and it was fun, don't ya think? But I also had another purpose. I, I just wanted to let you know that the word mulligan has another meaning. Grace, the Bible calls an unmerited favor, which is just forgiveness, forgiveness of your own and others' mistakes and imperfections. What if you could have a mulligan anytime you wanted in life when you've made a serious mistake. Yeah, of course who wouldn't? It sounds amazing, but it's impossible. Life's not a game, Will you can't do that. And besides I've already told you, I'm not good at asking people for do-overs. Oh, it's not about doing, it's about believing. Believing in what? God. Okay, why are we back to this God malarkey again? Paul, please don't use that word one more time about God. He's my father, he wants to be yours. Let me ask you, do you think you're as good as God? What kind of question is that? I mean, yeah I guess if there's a God, then he's better than me. Well, that's for sure, because God created all of us in his image to play his course. I call it the course less played. The course less played? Simply means that life is God's course, God's game, and he made all the rules, just like the Royal and ancients made theirs. Now of course it's difficult because not one of us can play a perfect round. Not one of us can live a perfect life to get to heaven. In fact, the game of life, if you miss one putt in an otherwise perfect round, you miss the cut. That sounds pretty harsh. It is because God requires a perfect round, and he knows not one of us can measure up to that. So he sent his only son, Jesus, to die on a cross, for our sins, our mistakes, and to give us a chance at a new life. Then he takes our scorecard. He signs his own name to it. He erases our mistakes. All we have to do is attest to it, turn it in as our own. Paul, aren't you ready to sign up? To accept Jesus as your divine teammate? Not quite yet, but thanks. Well, toughest test of a man's self-esteem is when he can just bow his head, say, "Lord, I want to thank you, for this new chance you've offered me, and I'm ready to walk with you as my life long guide." I'll, uh, I'll think about it. When you decide to tee it up on God's course, will you give me a call? I'll be waiting. You'll be the first to know. Actually the second. Right. I'll be seeing you around, Will. Okay, Paul. What's up. So Chao's people reached out this morning and they're ready to iron out the details. I'm headed to Singapore, and so are you, get packed. Perfect, I've been working on the Beyonsun deal as well. Yeah, let's talk about that. I reached out to some of my contacts in Korea, and apparently Beyonsun is aligned with some producers with some pretty poor reputations. We're buying their relationships, which would otherwise take us decades, to pry away from them. What matters most is the bottom line, performance, profit. You built your company on this. We can examine 'em more closely once we have a contract in place, weed out all the bad eggs if necessary. No, that makes sense. Let's buy this pony and ride it. I just, I'm not thrilled about the 2 million dollar due diligence fee. On a deal like this, that's a rounding error. You've got plenty of cash. I suppose. Why the paper? Old school company, no electronic signatures. Okay, see you on the plane. You're gonna love me, Kim. Seriously, you did it? He signed, he's in, just now. Brilliant Ted, you pulled it off. Well done, my friend. Now all we have to do is get the deal done with Chao, make the split from McAllister during the grace period, our numbers are gonna skyrocket. Once Chao figures out what happened, it'll be too late. So I'm going to Asia next week, Singapore. I'd love to have you come with me. Really? Yeah. I've just been thinking about your injuries, especially this one, and, you know, maybe it's time to think about the future. Dad, I, I, I made over, like, $50,000 in racing last year. Jake, come on. I mean your success with racing, it's phenomenal, I'm proud out of you, but I don't know. Maybe you should think about taking a job with my company. I mean, look, you, you majored in finance and marketing at Emory. You had solid grades. Maybe it's time to put that to use. Thanks Dad, but, I just don't think I'd meet your standards. Standards. You know, this, this might not make sense to you, Jake, but I, I believe things are gonna change with me, with us. Really? How so? There's a standard that I sure haven't measured up to. It's an impossible one, but boy have I missed the mark. I mean, life was meant to be lived a certain way, I haven't even come close. But I think the time for me to face it is right now. Mom's been praying for you for such a long time. Yeah. Me too, actually. - You too? - Yeah, yeah. God, I, I haven't led the best life, but for the first time you're starting to make sense to me. And I've never realized up until now how much I need you in my life. And even though I don't deserve it, please forgive me. I do believe. And Jesus, thank you. Thank you for dying for me and being willing to walk beside me from now on. I need your help. Help me to change and become the man that you've always wanted me to be. And please help Becca And Jake see me as a new man. I really need this mulligan. Amen? Amen. Mom's so totally going to freak. I love you, Dad. I love you, son. ♪ I'm tired from all I've held onto ♪ ♪ Weighed down by all that isn't true ♪ ♪ I'm bound, by my failure ♪ ♪ I'm weak from all I've tried to be ♪ ♪ So far forever being worthy ♪ ♪ I'm going under ♪ ♪ But you say ♪ ♪ Let go ♪ ♪ You buried my shame ♪ ♪ You carried the weight of all my burdens ♪ ♪ And all I'm holding now is you ♪ ♪ You broke every chain ♪ ♪ You lifted the weight of all my burdens ♪ ♪ And all I holding now is you ♪ Amen.

I feel more at peace than I have my entire life. Thank you Lord. Hey, let's get our golf clubs, let's go play some golf today. You're gonna play golf? Of course I am. All right, I'm excited. This doesn't mean I have to give you mulligans, does it? Oh, have mercy on an old pro, will you? Things with Jake are pretty good. I think he's seeing me differently, and with Rebecca, I'm just praying for a mulligan. Well, I'm gonna be praying that Rebecca will see God working in you. This never was about golf, was it? I think my work here is done. So, shall we get the show on the road? I had wished to be able to celebrate with you today, however, there's a matter I need to do discuss with Mr. McAllister in private. Give us the room for a moment, please. Just Mr. McAllister. I'm a blessed man, with a blessed family, blessed company. What I have learned over the years, not all money is good money. We do not do business with people that we cannot fully trust. Have I done something or said anything that's led you to believe I can't be trusted? There's no delicate way to say this, but your COO Ted, he's hiding something from you, from the both of us. With all due respect, how do you know this? My sources connected Ted to Beyonsun, a company that almost exclusively Correct? He presented the deal and we pursued it. Our research indicated it was a great acquisition, and yes, I'm sure he's consulted for them. He works for them. Beyonsun has been after my business for many years. Unbelievable. I don't work with companies that allow exploitation of their workers for their gain. Chao, I have no words. Put your house in order, then come back. Thank you for the mulligan. What was that all about, some ancient honor thing? Nope, it's a new honor thing. Who do you think I am, Ted? The old man's notoriously paranoid, what did he tell you? What I should have seen long before now, that I can't trust anything that comes outta your mouth. Find a new way home, you're not flying with us, figure it out. You know, maybe your employer Beyonsun, can spring for your ticket. Come on Jake, let's go home. Hey Paul, how's your trip? Harriet, you recall the Beyonsun contract I signed and we sent out last week? I need you to call legal and see if we can rescind the agreement. Then check to see if accounting has already initiated the funds transfer. You mean this contract? What? Well, I could tell you weren't really feeling it, so I never sent it. Thank you, thank you, shred it. And Harriet, I love you. Yes, Sir. Solid shots, Chao, for his wisdom and boldness to inform me and still stand by me despite my stupidity. Someday hopefully, an honorable business partner. Thank you God for your protection. Harriet is a champion. Thank you for surrounding me with the right people. Jake handled himself well, and I'm so glad he's with me. Mulligans, I still can't believe I didn't see it. I'm gonna need you to help me going forward Lord, especially with Rebecca. Hello neighbor, you've reached Will Dunn, the old pro. Sorry I missed your call, remember, God loves you, and so do I, please leave a friendly message. Hey Will, it's Paul, how you doing? I, I've been trying to reach you the last several days where are you old pro? Call me back. You've reached the Currahee Country Club, your call is very important to us. Hello golfers, you've reached the Pines Municipal Golf Course, if you'd like to book a tee time. Harriet? There are three flights to Currahee tomorrow, sending you the options. - Thank you. - Welcome. We gather here today on this 18th hole to remember a great man. He was known to most of us simply as the old pro, William For sit he Dunn, was a wonderful person. I'll never forget when he told me about how he longed in his heart to enter into the gates of heaven with thanksgiving, and into God's courts with praise for all that he had done for him. And he said that the seven words that he was living for and he wanted to hear, was well done, thou good, and faithful servant. And I expect by now he's heard those exact words and those of us who remain, we will never forget and forever be grateful for this man's witness in our lives. Never forget folks. The words of the old pro, life is a very special occasion, don't miss it. Can I get an Amen? Amen. Instead of a reception, the old pro had a special request. He wanted everyone to play for free this weekend. Ladies and gentlemen, make your tee time. It's a cathedral. I miss him. I could talk to him about anything and, and he made sense of everything. I know I'll never be able to take his place, I mean, nobody could, but I want you to feel free to call me anytime you would've called old pro, talk about anything, good, bad, in between, but I'll be there for you. And maybe we can tee it up together sometime. Absolutely. Yeah. You know, I think he knew his score card was all filled out. He hadn't heard from you in awhile, and almost his last day we talked about you and the new life you found. The ultimate mulligan. He, uh, he wanted you, he wanted you to have this. Wow. Because I live, you shall live also. Thank you, Marcus. The course less played. Yes, Sir. I'll tell you what. When you get to college, I want you to learn Mandarin. If you do that, I'll pay your tuition and your room and board. I'm serious, deal? Deal. Hey, I'm gonna need that one in writing, all right? You got it. Becca, hey it's Paul, I've got a company event coming up that I'd like you to attend. Harriet's got all the details, so I hope you can make it. Some of you may have noticed that I've been acting a little different around the office lately. Hopefully for the better. I'm sorry to say that not too long ago, I took a bad direction that could have harmed our company in a big way, but thankfully, I got a big mulligan on that one. I've, I've also made some mistakes in my relationships. A good friend had recently opened my eyes to this, and I want you to know that there's gonna be some significant changes. Starting with our core values. People first, with purpose, then progress. Above all, McAllister International is going to be a purpose driven company. And I also realized that I haven't been giving you, my incredible team, enough credit for our success. We love you, Paul. I love you too, George. You know, I, I heard a really troubling statistic last week. Our workforce is using less than 30% of their vacation time. I want that to change. Spend time with your families, your friends, your loved ones, however you wanna spend it, but spend it. So on that note, I would like to take a moment to introduce the newest member of our team, Jake McAllister. Jake, Jake, Jake. So, thanks in part to Jake, we are now the sole North American representative of Minufy Manufacturing located throughout Asia. You wanna say a few words? Yeah, um, I just want to thank all of you so much, from the bottom of my heart, and I, I'm going to need your help. You know, maybe I just better ask you guys, where is the mail room? Yeah, oh yeah, no, no I'm not forgetting. - Okay, all right. - Thanks for the reminder. You know, when I think back on this company and how we, we started in a little storefront, there's someone who has been with us since the beginning. Someone who has stood by me and my family through everything and has always had our best interests at heart, yet she hasn't been properly recognized, nor rewarded. So, as of today, Harriet, I have authorized the immediate deposit into your account, 1000 shares of McAllister stock, with options to purchase more. Yes, you are now an owner of the company, and by latest accounting, let's just say this, I'll be bringing you lunch. Thank you. It's, uh, you earned it, and it's long overdue I just took too long to realize it. I love you friend. - I love you too. Is she here? Yeah, he's matured since he, you know. Yeah, lots of changes. Yeah, a lot. Becca, take a walk with me? What's this all about Paul? Almost there. The coffee shop? Aw, that's been there forever. You know that used to be a malt shop. - A malt shop. Right. - Mm, hmm. Here you go, ma'am. - Hi. - Hi. Sir. - Thank you. - Thank you. Is this a date? Close. So, so this place you remember it? Yeah, sure. I, but we've never been here, I don't, I don't think. No, no, not together, not with me. I never told you this, but this is where I saw you for the first time. Yeah? With, who was that guy you were dating? Dating? I, I don't know, oh, that's been so long now. Walter. Yeah, see, you do remember. Uh, Walter Irkman. Mm, hmm, you were sitting right there at that table across from him, and you were having malts. - Paul- - I know, I know it was in the 10th grade, but still. I was, I was walking from practice to oh, to Gary Pew's house. - Oh, yeah. - Yeah. Yeah. - Yeah. And I looked over, and I stopped dead in my tracks. And there you were, so beautiful. And, for a moment it felt like nothing else mattered. And I knew it was gonna be you, I just knew. What do you want me to say? I've been learning a lot lately about second chances. I wanna be that guy that you deserve, the man that God always had in mind for you. I'm sorry. Please forgive me. Uh. What were you saying? Well, what I was trying to say is that you really should have married Walter. - Oh, okay. - Nice guy, really stable. - Boring. - Boring. I bet he works 9 to 5, drives a minivan, plays pickle ball on the weekends. See what you're doing, yeah, you wanna talk girlfriends, I can talk girlfriends.
