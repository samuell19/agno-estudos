[instrumental music] [music continues] Narrator: Out of the land of Egypt have come many tales of ancient times. During the centuries that have passed, the spinning wheel of the ages has mingled truth with fantasy. Until it is hard to say where truth leaves off and fantasy begins. Yet, all of these stories might have happened, for they tell of people whose ambitions and hates and loves were no different than our own. We tell the story of a girl, Naila, who was a queen and lived in the royal city of Khemmis on the banks of the River Nile. [instrumental music] Why is everyone running toward the wine shop? I think they have a new dancing girl. Well, come on, Bedai, let's watch her! No, no, no. Such distractions are not good for a man. Especially, when he has a wife who's three times his own size. Oh. [chuckles] Bedai, how is it that you, of all people, are not gazing on the lovely female down at the wine shop? [shushing] I have no more interest in women. They only cause me misery. [laughs] Woman 1: Bedai! - Yes, my love. Woman 1: Watch the shop! I'm going to rest for a while. [instrumental music] [clamoring] [clamoring] [instrumental music] [crowd clamoring] [music continues] [crowd clamoring] Who's the new dancer? Some desert girl, I suppose. A moment ago, she wasn't here. And suddenly, she was out there dancing. [music continues] [crowd laughing] [crowd clamoring] [crowd laughing] [music continues] [crowd clamoring] [music continues] [crowd cheering] [laughing] I told you I could do it. I danced in a public place without being recognized. What if it ever becomes known? I took your dare and I won. Five pieces of gold you owe me, Her it a. [laughing] The royal chariot has been sighted. My father returns so soon? Yes, and alone. Alone? [instrumental music] Come back with my horse, you thief! Gold! [music continues] [sobbing] [dramatic music] Man 1: The Scarlet Banner of Herua. Naila: And nothing can be done about the escaped slave who murdered my father? Herua is no ordinary slave. He is the leader of a band of escaped slaves. Every one of them is desperate as he is. They roam the deserts attacking caravans and slave markets. That's why your father went to meet him. To offer tribute and protect his subjects. Why must we offer tribute to a man like that? What do we have an army for? As well direct the army to attack moonlight. Herua strikes and is gone. What about our spies? We have sent many. None have returned. I don't understand it. All the power and wealth of Khemmis cannot overcome a small band of slaves? But you're very young, Your Majesty. It isn't easy to understand affairs of this sort. Our chance will come. Herua will make one move too daring. [crowd clamoring] Stop them. The noise is disturbing Her Majesty. No, I will appear before them. Man 2: Queen! We want the queen! We want the queen! Queen! We want the queen! Queen! We want the queen! [crowd clamoring] Man 3: Bring the murderer to justice. Man 4. Revenge for our ruler's death. [crowd clamoring] [instrumental music] You heard the voices of my people. They ask revenge for my father's death. We must listen to them. But, Your Majesty, there is no need to charge yourself with heavy and painful duties. You are young and very beautiful. Continue to seek your pleasures. You planned a journey to the horse fair at Naharina. Why not go, enjoy yourself? You were my father's counsellor, so you will be to me, but it is I who will rule. Which will be as you say. [instrumental music] I will go to the horse fair at Naharina, but not to enjoy myself. To the fair come nomads and horse dealers from all corners of the land. Wouldn't that be the place to look for Herua and his band? Their very lives depend on speed and wealth of their horses. Ah, but, Your Majesty, don't underestimate your enemies. As soon as you appear with your entourage, they will make themselves scarce. It is you who underestimate me. I will go alone, not as queen, but as a village traveler. Thus, I may go amongst those men of the desert unknown to them. I bow to your wisdom. I erred in thinking you are a young girl unskilled in statecraft. [music continues] [horse galloping] Bata. This is the slave dealer. His price will be the money he receives for her. Setna has explained everything? It will be easily done, My Lord. The girl has a beauty that will delight the buyers in the slave market. I have set you a task, I don't wish to know how you accomplish it. [instrumental music] [intense music] [music continues] [music continues] [fire crackling] Release me, or you will regret the evil day you were born. Brand her. [grunting] [mellow music] Start 'em moving. We'll leave. Chain them together. [lock clicks] [lock clicks] [music continues] [lock clicks] Maatet, look. [music continues] You are the slaver, Maatet? I have here the most beautiful of all slave girls. [music continues] Why, this is a fresh brand. I don't know where this girl came from... And her name? Slave girls have no names, only a price. - A price? Bata: 100 pieces of gold. [laughing] I wouldn't pay a hundred pieces of gold for any slave. But this slave will bring much more in the markets where you trade. No, a hundred's too much. Too many of them die on the way. - Fifty. - Here is no ordinary slave. She is a treasure worthy of a pharaoh's palace. I'll even include her stallion. [music continues] Bata: Surely this is a fabulous combination. It's well worth a hundred pieces of gold. A hundred it shall be. [speaking in foreign language] [horse neighing] [intense music] [music continues] [music continues] The stallion is too fast for us. [mellow music] [music continues] [horse neighing] Oh, treasure of our heart, forgive us for parting with you. It is only because we love you, friend Khafra, that we even think of such a trade. You dare offer this half-dead old mongrel for my beautiful beast? Of course not. We offer our noble horse, Tahuti, for your broken-down stallion, but only if you include your filthy tent. That is the most ridiculous offer I've ever received. Out of my way with this dying goat of yours. [Nebka imitates whinnying] Nebka imitating horse: Who is this sand flea who calls me a dying goat? I did. [Nebka imitates whinnying] Did I or did I not hear that animal speak? Nebka imitating horse: Certainly you heard me speak. Oh, don't mind what he says. He-- he's a very foolish horse. A talking horse? Nebka imitating horse: A talking man. Oh! B-- b-- b-- but this is magic. I-- I-- I've heard of such things, but I-- I never believed them till now. Well, come along, Nebka. Goodbye, Khafra. Oh, wait, wait. I will give you my dumb, stupid horse. I will give you the tent. Everything! Only, I must own this talking horse. [indistinct whispering] [indistinct whispering] - Then he is yours. Khafra: Ah! Say something to me, oh, my beloved. Nebka imitating horse: Let us leave these cutthroats before they change their minds. [Nebka imitates whinnying] You throw your voice so well, I'm beginning to believe in talking horses myself. This beast has no prize, but he is sounder than old Tahuti. Come, let's ready ourselves. [instrumental music] Nebka: What eyes. What muscles! What legs. Ooh. What a beautiful mouth. Nebka, bring water. She lives. Why worry about a woman? Look at this horse! Merab: Wet a cloth for her brow. Fill a cup of her lips. Nebka: Uh, the most beautiful animal I've ever seen. [instrumental music] Naila: Who are you? Two humble travelers on our way to the horse fair at Naharina. I, too, am journeying there. Take me with you and... you will be greatly rewarded. Rewarded? By a slave girl? Let's turn her over to the slavers before we get in trouble. Once when we starved in a dirty prison cell... Yeah, I know, just for borrowin' a few horses. But I had a dream, I was a prince. I-- I had food and wine and palaces and-- and beautiful slave girls. Yeah, I know. One meets such nice people in one's dreams. Well, dream all you like, but don't risk our lives because you fancy a slave girl. Yes, I-- I guess it would be foolish. [dramatic music] Quickly! Quickly into the grove! And take the stallion. She makes a sound, we die. You there, we seek an escaped slave girl who rides a golden stallion. Have you seen her? - Huh! - Maybe this will make you talk! [screaming] [Bata grunts] [screaming] Bata: Have you seen her? She must have gone another way. These dumb ones have no reason to lie. [instrumental music] - What did you get? - His dagger. - What about you? - His purse. - Where was that? Oh. - On the other side. I am grateful. Let's leave her here and take the horse. There are races for rich prizes at the horse fair. If you will take me, I could ride my stallion and win much gold for you. We don't need her. I can ride that stallion. No... Nebka: Steady, old boy! Whoa! Whoa! Take it easy now. Take it easy. Whoa! Oh! Steady, old boy. Steady. Whoa! Nice, pretty, old boy. Nice boy. An unruly horse and a dangerous woman. Only evil can come of this. Take me to Naharina with you. I go there to find Herua, the leader of escaped slaves. Herua? You'll lose your heads if you get mixed up with him. No. It will be worth your while to protect me. I will win races for you. Your purse will be full. [scoffs] You can't spend gold from the gallows. Here is a fine horse and a slave girl to ride him for us. We will disguise her and take her with us. Very well. We were born to hang, we might as well do it together. It is a small risk... for so great a prize. I'll get the horse. [instrumental music] [crowd clamoring] - There she is. - Be quiet. Let it not be known. Fifty pieces of gold on the black mare. Who'll bet 50 pieces of gold? Fifty gold pieces, done. - Well, how will-- - Shh! Here is my wager. Let me see yours. What? Don't you trust me? We're the owners of the golden stallion. I trust the horse, not you. I'll wager my gold, but if you lose, I'll take the stallion. I should have drawn my dagger for that insult. Ahem. I too noticed he had the wrist of an expert swordsman. He sure do... Hey, where are you gonna get fifty pieces of gold now, when? You must be a magician, I couldn't find one. There's one more. Where is the black mare? [indistinct yelling] [instrumental music] Man 5: You are to race around those pylons and finish at the same line. [gong strikes] [intense music] Look at the two in front. These desert horses run like the wind. I didn't come here to watch a race. Look about you. Maybe she came here to search for Herua. She said she would. [music continues] Hey, what if she... I mean, he keeps on going? We'll lose the race and have no horse to pay the wager. They'll hang us. That's what they'll do. [music continues] - Look! - Yes! The stallion's ahead. We're winning. - Come on! - Come on! [music continues] - Come on! - Faster! [music continues] - Look at our horse fly. - Come on! [both cheering] The prize is ours. Twenty pieces of gold. And the wager too, fifty pieces of gold. - Yeah! - Come on! Thank you. Whoo-hoo! [indistinct chatter] Look, the golden stallion. Yes, and ridden by a nomad. [all clamoring] I have seen the Princess Naila ride her stallion too often to be fooled by that. Kamore, I love you. - I said I would win. - You were wonderful. - May I speak to you? - Who, me? - Do you own the stallion? - Well, all of us. Him, him, and me. I'll offer you any three of my horses for your stallion. Three horses? I've never ridden against a better animal. Perhaps you'd be willing to offer money? There's nothing as fascinating as the tinkle of gold pieces. The stallion is not for sale. Come, follow me. But we can get three horses with the... [chuckles] Well, three horses for... We have purchased all the horses that we need. I will join you in a moment. I've seen something here which intrigues me. Nebka: Seventy pieces of gold. This slave girl is worth more to us than a queen. There will be other races tomorrow with richer prizes for the winner. Then tonight... let us spend what we've won today, the three of us. I have more important things to do. You mean, finding Herua? But how can you, when no one knows what he looks like? It is one thing to salute a superior animal... it is another to find that a woman has beaten me. You lost fairly. What more do you ask? Only to feast my eyes upon your... slave girl. I've heard there was a girl of your description that escaped recently from the slaver, Maatet. Oh, I knew it! I knew it! I knew it! We're trapped! - What is it you wish? - I will not betray her. On the contrary, I offer safety. A place in the desert where no slavers could follow. See how close we are to discovery, to torture, to slow execution? Oh, please, Merab. Uh-- uh, perhaps you would be willing to offer a few pieces of gold for this girl? - How many? - Well, I don't know. Let's make a deal... If I had no money to purchase food, if I like clothing to shield my skin from the sun, still I would not sell her. - A hundred pieces of gold? - Oh, please, Merab. I'll buy you an entire harem. Only let us sell this one dangerous female, please. What can you offer for the feeling of joy when I look at her? What price for the exultation in my heart when she smiles? When she is near, I am a king. No, not you, not to her, but to myself. Please, Merab, he offers gold. His words stem from this... this exquisite inspiration. And I understand. [Nebka clicking tongue] Our paths may not cross again but I will always remember. [instrumental music] Would you've wished to have gone with him? - I am content. - Well, I'm frightened. Man 6: In here. [gasps] [clears throat] - This girl's an escaped slave. Nebka: We didn't know. We bought her in good faith. [dramatic music] Nebka: Help! Help! Merab! Merab, I'm trapped! Merab, get me out of here! Oh, Merab! Ow! [groaning] Merab! Ow! Ooh! Ow! I knew we should never have gotten messed up with that girl. Oow! [music continues] Alright, take them both! [Nebka groaning] [music continues] Your Excellency, she demands to be taken to the palace of Khemmis. She says the lord counsellor will punish us all. The slave's insolent. According to the law of the land, escaped slaves and criminals who harbor them shall be torn apart by wild horses. Let it be thus. Nebka: Well, here we are. It was bound to happen. I'm sorry we could not protect you. I had no right to entangle your fortunes with mine. I am to blame. No, no, I demanded it. If there is any blame, it is mine. You two share the blame and I share the wild horses. [horses neighing] [intense music] Take the fat one first. Oh, no, I'm not proud! I'll gladly go last. Honest, now, well, I don't wanna go first. Come on. Alright, bring him around here. [horses neighing] [music continues] - Ugh! - Tie him tight, men. [instrumental music] [horses neighing] [horses neighing] [swords clanking] [swords clanking] [music continues] [swords clanking] [music continues] [swords clanking] [music continues] [swords clanking] [music continues] [blows bugle] [mellow music] [music continues] Rest if you can. You will be safe soon. My people will try to make you forget what has happened. I will never forget. Nor will I forget that it was you who saved me. That you're safe is reward enough. [music continues] Uba will meet us close by with our horses. You have arranged for everything. When one guards a treasure, he leaves nothing to chance. What of the others? All safe. We escaped with ease. We ride much faster for our lives than they for their pay. What of my friends, Merab and Nebka? They await you at our village. [instrumental music] [music continues] [horses galloping] [music continues] Man 7: Welcome, welcome. Woman 2: Praise the Gods for your safety. Man 8: God for good. - All is well? - Yes, we're in good hands. Take this girl, let her be clothed and refreshed, and then bring her to me. I begin to wonder if he saved her for me or himself. If he'd only keep her, I'd breathe freely again. 4 We hear J 4 The call I 4 To love J J The songs that calls J On to love J [humming] I--- I wish I had words to describe your loveliness. Do not think me ungrateful, but may I ask you a question? Please do. This morning, we were strangers. Yet, this afternoon, you risked your life and that of your men to save me. Why? The sight of you now assures me that I made no mistake. I am a slave girl, there are many such who could be purchased at no risk. You think it's strange that I interfered with your execution? Perhaps you think that one slave owner takes you from another? - Such is the custom. - There are other reasons, too. But they all vanish from my mind and... only your beauty remains. I, I cannot look at you without... wanting desperately to press my lips to yours. Are you talking to your slave? No, you are talking to your slave. [people humming] ♪ I hear ♪ ♪ The call ♪ ♪ To love ♪ ♪ Mm mm mm ♪ ♪ Mm-mmm ♪ ♪ While sands reflect ♪ ♪ Ooh ooh ♪ ♪ The moonlight ♪ ♪ I hear a heart ♪ ♪ That calls ♪ ♪ To mine ♪ ♪ I hear a heart that calls to... ♪ ♪ Mm mm mm ♪ ♪ Mm-mm ♪ ♪ The call grows clear ♪ ♪ And strong ♪ ♪ Each star looks down ♪ ♪ Each star looks down ♪ ♪ And sighs ♪ ♪ Don't fear ♪ ♪ Give all to love ♪ ♪ Give all to love ♪ ♪ My heart ♪ ♪ My soul ♪ ♪ Replies ♪ ♪ I hear ♪ ♪ The call ♪ ♪ To ♪ ♪ Love ♪♪ [humming] I have often heard the songs of the desert, but they have never been so beautiful. I do not think I shall mind my bondage. You are not in bondage. No one is a slave here. We all were once. [instrumental music] Have you ever heard of Herua? Indeed I have. I am Herua. And I have vowed to free all slaves, wherever they may be. My men and I have pledged to fight as long as there are those who crush others beneath them. You tremble. Are you frightened because I am Herua? It is said that you do not hesitate to murder. I was born a slave. It was not meant for men to be born so. Oh, were slaves born to be murderers? Yes, I have killed when I had to, so others could live to be free. [music continues] And this is your stronghold of the slaves? Yes, the slavers and the armies would like to find it, but it is like finding a flea in a herd of camels. And what if they should happen on it by chance? They have so many men. We have poised great dams of stones at the rim of the plateau. A few men could cut the thongs and start them down. The strongest armies are no match for an avalanche. But this is not the night to speak of unpleasant things. I can't give no thought to such dreams that are made of moonlight while slaves die in chains. - What would you do? - I could be useful. More useful that you realize. Once I lived in the palace of Khemmis. I was a... dancing girl. I could return there. Wouldn't not be helpful for you to know the plans of the slavers' caravans? A spy in the palace of the queen? Oh, it is a chance given to us by the Gods. If you could come back to me with that information... They would suspect me if I left the city. Then I could send a man to meet you within the city. Would you send another to enjoy the moments we might spend together? I will come myself at the first night of the next full moon. Then meet me at the shop of Mestet, the wine merchant. - When will you leave? - At dawn. My two friends will accompany me. One day, perhaps, these evil hours may be ended and then we can stand together as man and woman. You will not forget this meeting with the slave girl? As well ask me if I will forget my heart. [instrumental music] Are you certain we'd be permitted to enter the palace? They had us once. You know what will happen if they catch us again. I would not bring you here were I not certain of our safety. [music continues] My Lord, the queen returns. - With the Heruan army? - No, alone. With two strange looking men. [claps] It appears they remember you even at that. Hey, let's go around the back. Why, there is no use antagonizing them. There will be no trouble. Oh, from the moment we found her, we've had nothing but trouble, trouble, trouble. Don't you think you're going too far? - We could be hanged. - Yeah. I give thanks to the Gods for your safe return, Your Majesty. "Your Majesty?" I am Naila, queen of Khemmis. I promised you would be rewarded for helping me, and so you shall be. I invite you to remain in the palace. Whatever you ask, shall be granted. Hey, pinch me, Merab, I'm dreamin'. [giggles] I should have known that you were no ordinary woman. We are grateful, Your Majesty. What of your mission to the desert? The murderer, Herua, will be in our hands the first night of next the full moon. But, Your Majesty, Herua saved our lives. My father's murder must be avenged. Nothing else matters. I understand. [instrumental music] She suspects nothing. She is still to be treated as queen until I tell you. [instrumental music] [indistinct chatter] [music continues] [music continues] [crowd cheering] [indistinct yelling] Seize him! [clattering] [intense music] [clatters] [dramatic music] So... the slave girl is a queen. A queen of deceit. A queen of false allure. A queen who uses her beauty to trap the unwary. Silence. - This man murdered your father. - You lie! Horadef: There can be only one verdict, Your Majesty. Death to the murderer. Death as the sun rises. Let it be slow and agonizing. The way of the headsman is sure and swift. Let it be thus. Look closely, oh, Queen. It is not I who tremble but you. I will be dead and past remembrance, but you will never forget as long as you live. [dramatic music] Majesty, during your absence, many other affairs of state-- Nothing more. Not today. [instrumental music] Merab: Do you weaken in your desires for revenge, Your Majesty? I torture myself more than I torture him. But, My Lady, he is the murderer of your father. There is no proof that it was he. Only a banner flying over the royal chariot. A piece of colored cloth. And if he were innocent, would you order him freed, so that he might come to you? [music continues] If I were a slave girl or the daughter of a merchant, I could go to him. But I am a queen, and he is a rebel. And because I am a queen, I must condemn the one man in my life. These things pass. Another will come to make you forget and bring you new happiness. Perhaps, someone close to you. So close that... that you do not see him. There will be no other. [instrumental music] Why couldn't this have happened to me 20 years ago? [all laughing] [music continues] Nebka: Merab! Seems there is a future in picking pockets. Have a sweet-meat, relax and enjoy the surroundings. We might wake up at any moment. Send the girls away. [claps] [women giggling] You know my secret hopes. You have no secrets from me, you love the queen. And on which side would you wager? We have never lied to one another about our wagers. - Have we? - No. I wouldn't bet a moth-eaten donkey on your chances. But if such things can happen as a slave girl becoming a queen, then, then why not a pick-pocket marrying one? I've heard of such weddings from the old story-tellers. But always seems a pick-pocket turns out to be a prince in disguise. - Is that necessary? - I'm afraid you'll find it so. Haven't you ever noticed the look in her eyes as she gazes upon Herua? She hates him. He was the murderer of her father. Well, then that's one obstacle out of your way. You should rejoice. The queen must be pleased to have him executed. Yet, her tears were not of joy. I have seen it. Her heart breaks for Herua. I tell myself that it will pass, but... Nebka, I have made up my mind. Have two horses waiting at the gates. Oh, must we flee again from such magnificence? That, my friend, is the way of fate. [groans] [instrumental music] I've come to repair the block. - It must be ready by dawn. - It's seen much use lately. Merab: One might almost wish to be in this fellow's shoes. After tomorrow, he'll have no taxes to pay, no toil, no hag of a wife to plague him. Aye! One tiny chop, and he's through. ' - Ah! - I'll help you! Oh, a thousand pardons. My, my leg. [chains rattling] You need any help? No, I'll call you when I finished. [door closes] Make ready to leave. I slipped it from the guard's pocket. You, the queen's man! [dramatic music] How can we get past the guards? We can't, but you can, in the clothes I'm wearing. When they find you've taken my place, they'll tear you apart. By that time, you'll be safe in the desert. No, no, sweet as life may seem at this moment, it is not so sweet that I can except such a sacrifice. Sacrifice? Fifty thieves are waiting outside to storm the jail the minute I give the signal. Here, take my cloak. [music continues] You'll find Nebka waiting at the gate with horses. [rattling] [music continues] You're the last visitor he'll ever have. Herua: Yeah. [dramatic music] [horses galloping] [chains rattling] [dramatic music] [rattling] [music continues] Horadef: This isn't Herua! Aye. But the corridor's been guarded all night. The prisoner couldn't possibly have escaped. - Where is Herua? - My Lord. I must've been a victim of black magic. Last night, I fell asleep in a, in a back-room o-- of the harem, on a strange carpet. Now, now, I know it must have been a, a magic flying carpet, for, for when I woke up, I was no longer in the place where I went to sleep, but here in this cell. You can see, I know nothing whatsoever of this Herua of whom you speak. Permit me to depart in peace. Release him. I said, "Release him." You see, Your Majesty, they're not you guards, but my soldiers. It isn't you who give the orders. - The masquerade is over. - You speak treason. I rule the city of Khemmis now. The only treason is to defy me. Why... Cease her! Put her in the other cell. Surround the palace grounds. Search every house, find Herua. [mellow music] I'm sorry my adventure ended so poorly, Your Majesty. You helped Herua escape, did you not? It's not in my heart to do nothing while you yearn for his safety. It was a noble thing you did. I could ask for no better company. If we ought to die, Horadef shall die with us. I have stolen his dagger. When he enters the cell again... Of course, I, uh... I appropriated his purse. Wonder what he carried. [clattering] [chuckles] Will be a good thing to meet the headsmen wearing Horadef's own ring. Merab! The ring! Do you know what it means? Only that it is very beautiful. It is the seal of Khemmis. The circlet of entwined serpents. What then, Your Majesty? My father was wearing it when he went out to meet Herua. When he returned, it was missing from his finger. - Then Horadef is the murderer. - Of course. He planned to move his army into the city of Khemmis from the beginning. Only he knew of my mission into the desert. Only he could've sent his slavers to capture me. Merab: Then Herua is innocent. -Yes. The hours I spent with him... I can remember now with pride. [music continues] Merab, I am grateful to you. Then I am happy. I should've known that the distance between us was too great. A thief may reach for a star, but, but he cannot touch it. This I promise you, we will learn the location of the slave stronghold. You want protection for your caravans against the raids of Herua? You'll have it once and for all. You want slaves? When we smash his stronghold, you shall have your fill. - It's agreed. - We'll support your rule. We have searched the entire city, Herua has escaped. The fool Merab can be a more valuable prisoner than Herua. Torture might not move the lips of a slave leader. But it will be another matter with a thief. - Huh. - Put him to the rack. [growling] [creaking] [Merab groaning] [groans] [groans] No! Tell me where to find Herua. No! No! Do not tell! My patience is endless. Another turn. [creaking] - Let him down. Merab: No! - I will tell. Merab: No! No! Do not tell! [groans] No! No! There is a mountain pass. It is far away and difficult to find. - But you can find it? - On one condition. That you set Merab free. We have nothing to fear from him. Order him freed. - You will ride with us? -Yes. Perhaps, it is the will of the Gods that I destroy the murderer of my father. Assemble my soldiers. [dramatic music] [music continues] Stop here! Stop! Thief! [music continues] [music continues] [music continues] Merab. The queen promised to lead Horadef and his troops against your stronghold in order to save my worthless skin. And I'm but a little time ahead of the column. Sound the alarm! [gong strikes] [clamoring] [indistinct yelling] [instrumental music] This is the only entrance? Yes, up this trail. At the top is a plateau. On it, the stronghold of his slaves. It's a dangerous route. Herua certainly will have prepared defenses against just such an attack. No, his only defense is the hidden location of the village. I will lead you. [music continues] There they come! And the queen at their very head. She would die so that Horadef may be destroyed. And so that you may live. [music continues] [music continues] Why are you waiting? If I send the rocks down now, she will also be killed. We will wait, until she passes the next turn. Then she'll be out of danger. She risked her life to save mine. - I gamble time to save hers. - Oh!
