Knock it off! The next shot is into the fuckin' crowd, and I don't give a flyin' fuck who it hits! Never lay your hands on a pregnant woman! Wait, you're pregnant? Yeah. Oh my god! Congratulations! Wow, Cass. When you said you had balls, I thought you meant figuratively. Yeah, we just passed the three-month mark. Shit's gettin' kinda real. Who's the donor? As far as we know, it's a 6'3" lawyer who loves long walks on the beach and jacking off into test tubes. I thought you've just been eating too many gas station burritos. Yeah, I'm probably equal parts burrito and baby at this point. Be kinda hard to play with a baby on your hip, don't you think? Why don't we cross that bridge when we get to it, yeah? Just uh, pretend you're happy for now. It's just a little baby. Seriously, best fuckin' concert ever! You guys are the real deal. Appreciate that. Check it out. I lost two fuckin' teeth! Well, a show's not a show without a little bit of blood, am I right? Fuck yeah. Can I get a selfie? Yeah. Still haven't had enough, you leather-lovin' pussies? We can finish what we started right here. You bitches got big fuckin' mouths, don't you? You've got fragile little egos, don't you? - Suck a dick. - I'm allergic. You got any more large t-shirts left? This ain't fucking over Fuck me, do you girls know how to put on a show. Not every day you see somebody work a crowd like that, or beat the shit out of one. Especially you, axe master. Oh and two CDs. One for the car, one for the bedroom if you know what I mean. Let's get you off your feet, babe. That'll be 40. Lead singer he gets all the groupies, huh? You ask me, it's you who deserves all the attention. The way you work that axe, it's fucking art is what it is. The way you wield it. It's like a weapon. So, where to next? Another buttfuck town, then back home to Canada. A long way from home, aren't you? Just trying to get our name out there, man. Oh, you're gonna get your name out there. I get a feeling you're gonna be filling arenas soon. People will be chanting your name. Emma, Emma, Emma, Emma, Emma, Emma, Emma, Emma. Emma! Emma! Jesus Christ. You okay? - Like you give a shit. - Oh, just stop. You know what, forgot I even asked. I don't need another melodramatic monologue from you Why, because you know I'm right? Or because you're too drained from fucking groupies? You honestly think you're the only person who cares about the music, after all this time? -Yeah.-Guys. Some of us put in the work, you know, actually try to get better. And who's been booking the fucking gigs? - Oh my god... - Keeping the band alive. We just played a fucking biker bar! I could have gotten myself killed back there. - Guys... - You wanna be a rock star? This is it, baby. What the fuck did you expect? Look at my hand, asshole. 'Cause I could have broken it, and then what, huh? Some of us have talents beyond sucking dick - and taking our clothes off. - Oh, go fuck yourself! - Fuck you! - Oh, fuck you. - No, fuck you! - Guys! Not to be obnoxious but I got a baby on board, remember? Fuck. What the hell? Oh, motherfucker! Leave us alone, asshole! What the fuck is this guy's problem? What did you say to him, Emma? What did I say? Fuck you! Fuck off, cocksucker! Fuck you! Emma! Oh my god. Really? Nothing to fuckin' say? Are you fuckin' trying to catch this psycho? He just tried to fucking kill us, Emma! Emma, stop the fucking van before I- Emma stop the van! Ah, fuck! Can this night get any fuckin' worse? I really don't think it can. This is fucked up. Yeah. Hey guys? Look at this. Ew. What kinda cannibal hillbilly shit is that? That fucking psychopath. Fuck, he's coming back. Oh my god. Okay. What the fuck do we do, guys? Guys? We got an APB out on that car. If he's still on the road, we'll find him. So where are you ladies coming from tonight? We were just playing a show. So was that you that started the riot over at the Rusty Chicken? - Riot? I don't know about all that. We were just helping kids let out some steam in a fun and safe environment. All set here, sheriff. But I only got room for one in the wrecker. The rest of you can ride with me. I'll make sure you get to where you need to be. Guess I'm riding with Leatherface then. I know you girls these days are all about equality and female empowerment and all that but wouldn't it be wise to have, I don't know, like a roadie or someone to take care of you? Wait, you mean like a man? Like a pair of balls to keep us helpless little bitches... Oh, I am so sorry, Sheriff. It's been a really long, weird night, you know? Im sure has. Here we are. You girls'll be all fixed up in no time. No time at all. What is this place? This is over 30 acres of scrap metal, engine blocks, vulcanized rubber, axles, grills, dashes, windshields and everything under the god's green earth is recycled right here and repurposed. Seriously? Is there a problem? Have you never seen a horror movie, Sheriff? I think it looks fuckin' rad. We could shoot a kick-ass video in this place. Daniel is a good man. Besides, would I take you somewhere that wasn't safe? You really have never seen a horror movie. I swear to god, if I fucking die first, I'm gonna haunt your bitch ass. This is fucking bullshit. Make yourselves comfortable. Yeah, comfortable he says. Mind your fucking business. Don't. She'll only hate you if you say anything. She already does. - Wow. Didn't think you'd answer. Yeah well, me too I guess. Fuck sakes, I'm in a dead zone, one sec. You were saying? I was asking where you guys were. I don't even know, it was some sort of recycling facility. Some lunatic ran us off the road, so now we're stuck here until the van gets fixed. What? Is everyone okay? Yep, Tim. Amy's just fine. That's not what I meant. Where are you guys? I can come get you. No, you won't. I'm fine. Fuck. Em? Emma. Guys, is the building on fire? That's exhaust. Emma? Emma? What's going on? Em? Em can you hear me? Guys, cover your mouths! Jill! Emma! Fuck! Emma, what's going on? Can you hear me? - I'll call you back. - No no no no... Help me! Get back! What are you doing out here? You shoulda stayed with the others. Would have been easier for the both of us. Emma, Emma! Shhh. Emma! Hey. You're okay. Yeah. Here, drink. There we go. What have you done to me? It's okay. You've been chosen. -Chosen?-Yeah For what? To appease the gods. So rest now, okay? Your baptism is coming up very soon. Who are you? Please! Whatever it is you're doing, just stop Please Fuck! Emma! Amy? Cassy? My pick hand. It's gone. What have they done to us? Wait, the baby. I, I don't... Ladies! Welcome to the Gridiron. Every day is a sunshine day. For the gods shine their light down upon us. But today, my friends, today is especially bright. The gods have blessed us with four wondrous new recruits. We give our blood to the dirt. We give our blood to the dirt. From the dirt will rise life. From the dirt will rise life. So that we will prosper! So that we will prosper! Wait! Stop! I don't mean what you expect, but we're not fighting. It's very simple. You either fight for your life like true warriors or die like a coward, your choice. At least let Jill go, she's pregnant! My dear. Do you really think that we would allow a woman with child to do battle? What do you think we are, barbarians? You motherfucker! I'm gonna kill you! That's the spirit. No! Cassy! Stay with me. No! Noo! No! Fuck you, you cocksuckers! While you may have the heart of a warrior, you certainly have the mass of a trucker. Stop! Stop it! Stop! You're gonna wake the baby. It's okay. You're safe. Did they do that to you? You need your strength. You should eat. Why are you doing this? Nothing I say is gonna satisfy you. All that matters now is survival. What the fuck are you doing in here? Bringing the warrior her breakfast. Emperor's command. "The Emperor's command." Is that what it is? You don't have to talk like that all the goddamn time. My dad isn't here. Get the fuck out. Cassy. Don't, okay? - Cassy, I was- - Don't fucking say anything. - Cassy, I... Please! Just leave me the fuck alone. Come with me. Both of you. Let's make something clear. You wouldn't be getting all this first class treatment if I wasn't sweet on you. So I'm gonna let that one slide. Dad's happy with you, with all of you, just like I knew he'd be. That's why you're in here with me, It's a hell of a lot better than what the rest of them get. Your sister, for example. Where is she? Locked up like a dog, that's where. But not you, Emma. Like I told you before. It's you who deserves all the attention, not her. You've got it. So I'd appreciate it, if you'd start giving me a little more fucking gratitude around here. What!? I'm fuckin' busy! Fuck! Fuck! Stop. Line up. You, there. You, there, and you there. You passed your first test. But those weren't real warriors. I can barely lift this shit. If you wanna defeat true warriors, it's gonna take a lot of work. If you wanna survive. And what if we don't? Cassy! What if I choose death instead? Then I'll kill you where you stand. See? You're not ready to die. So fight for your life. You love him, don't you? We all love the Emperor. He keeps us in good favour with the gods. That's not who I'm talking about. You should get some rest. Driller's training has killed almost as many as the Gridiron itself. Hey, you can talk to me. Like really talk to me. What's your name? Lea. Did he bring you here? Me and my brother and my sister. We were on road trip. And it was my idea too. Stupid. So fucking stupid. My brother and my sister were killed in our first battle. That's where I lost my leg. They were gonna kill me that day too but Sam stopped them. Said he saw something special in me. Convinced the Emperor to keep me here, same as you. Lea, you have to help me get out of here. We'll go together, and bring back help for the others. You get our girl all patched up? Yes, she's a true warrior, a fast healer. Goddamn right she is. Truest fuckin' warrior we got. Not bad, huh? Your own private room, servant girl. And it's only gonna keep getting better, baby. My guitar. Is this a joke? No, no. Listen, Come here. We can do anything together, okay? It's killing you that she's getting special attention, isn't it? No. But why her? I never understood you two. You only ever got along on stage. Offstage you're complete fucking assholes to each other. It's probably for the best you've been separated, you probably would have killed each other by now. In ancient Rome... Each gladiator took an oath. I will endure to be burned. To be bound. To be beaten. To give my blood to the earth, so that the crops may grow. For those of you who fight, glory and victory await. You always talk like Thor with the hammer up his ass? Or just when you know people are watching? Soon you will return to the Gridiron, where it will be the gods who are watching. Sam did well with his new warriors. You should be proud. I've felt many things about my son. Pride is not one of them. Sam is smart. Although he likes to pretend he's not. His instincts just need time to ripen. Drug addicts. Mental patients. Vagrants, whores. A girl band. This is who he offers to our gods? Why? Because hunting for squirrels is less dangerous than hunting for lions. My son lacks the... Patience, my Emperor, patience. These women have potential to do great things. I haven't seen this much promise since Driller first came to us. Gods shine their light down upon us. Shit. Whoa, man, holy shit! What the fuck do you want? We're closed. Okay, listen, my girlfriend's band played here recently. They've disappeared, so I was wondering if you could... Those are the little bitches who started the goddamn riot. You find them, you bring them back here. It's gonna cost them an arm and a leg. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Wait. Wait. Is there a scrapyard or anything around here? Couple of miles down that road. But I'd stay the fuck away from it if I was you. She would have been a great mom. You both would have. No, I would have fucked things up, left and right. Jill. She always knew what to do. She gave me a reason to live. She still does. Getting vengeance for her is the only reason I haven't fucking offed myself yet. They're training us to fight but they don't realize that they're just making us stronger and I swear to fucking God, the first chance that I get... The first chance that we get, we're going to escape this cell, and we're going to kill every last one of those motherfuckers, okay? You. Training session, now. You know you belong here. You were made for this place. Or should I say this place was made for you, Axe Master. With that ax, you get admiration. But with this axe... Oh my god, you get admiration, respect, fear, and most importantly, power. My old man's getting weak. Mentally, physically. Soon this place will be under my rule. You could be my queen. We'd make one hell of a power couple, don't you think? So we just need you to get through this next battle, which is why I had them add something a little extra for you. What else can they make me? Anything your heart desires, my queen. Today we stand below our gods, humbled. From the time our forefathers came from the old... Look I don't know what that creepazoid's up to, but I think he has an ulterior motive with you. Their wisdom and their tradition... Because he's fawning over me and not you? Look i'm just trying to help you, Emma. I can do fine on my own, thanks. ...who truly believe. We give our blood to the dirt. We give our blood to the dirt. From the dirt will rise life. From the dirt will rise life. So that we will prosper! So that we will prosper! I told you it wasn't over, didn't I bitch? Oh, you piece of shit. You know, I always heard rumours about this place. Sure as shit, it's as fucked up as I expected. Y'all want to watch what we do to these punk cunts, be my fucking guests. You didn't get enough of me rearranging your face the first time? - No! He's mine. The Emperor is very pleased with your progress. Continue on this path, and the gods will surely reward you. You think I could get rewarded with an upgraded cell? That's not within my power. But I will tell you this. You show the most potential of all. I saw it the first day. Something in your eyes. A potent sort of anarchy. I may be the anarchist, but my sister, she's the artist. The one with true talent. You know, she knew her purpose early on but, I'm still trying to figure out mine. Driller was much like you when he came to us. It wasn't until he became a warrior for the gods, that he reached his full potential. Shit. Hey, that's my girlfriend's van. Did you see them that night? - Girlfriend, huh? - Yeah. Emma, the guitarist. She called me from I think here, said someone ran them off the road... Oh yeah, I remember that. In fact, I was the one who brought them here so my good friend Daniel could fix them up, God bless his soul. Do you know what they did after that? No, only the gods know. But why don't you follow me inside and we can see if anybody knows anything. That would be awesome. Thanks. You're banging the guitarist, right? - Yeah. - Good on you. Is that all you have? I'm tired. That's why you have to keep training. Get up! That's not what I mean, I'm tired of fighting. Then you'll cease to have a purpose. Oh go fuck yourself. You act like I chose this shit. Like I want to murder innocent people and for what? Your gods are thirsty? In this place, death is a gift. And what about Jill, huh? Was that a gift? When we fight, we leave all that we were behind, and ascend to a higher purpose. She was obviously not worthy. What did you leave behind, huh? A wife? A child? What was your past? A bum? An addict? What kind of pathetic little man were you before the gods gave you a purpose? You have no fucking right to ask. And don't you ever speak of my family again. There he is. I knew all that Game of Thrones shit was just an act. You're not one of them. You know, you don't have to keep punishing yourself. So tell me the truth. What scares you more, huh? My machete, or my pussy? Stop. I see you looking at me. You wanted me from the minute you saw me. Fuck... Go get cleaned up! The Emperor expects you for dinner tonight. Damn, this was just getting good. Little longer, I woulda had a chubby. I hear somebody's looking for a little upgrade. A room at the Ritz would be nice. Well, there's nothing I can do about that now but in the meantime, how 'bout a little enhancement? Trust me, you're gonna need this next time you're here. One catch. You're gonna have to fight for it. -Who?-Me. Abso-fucking-lutely. I'm gonna let you two get acquainted while I slip into something A little more comfortable. [grunting What a waste of a perfectly good shirt. No! I'm so sorry. I had no idea. Shut up! Please. You're not my sister. You're my enemy. Get away! Leave! Warriors, friends. The last two battles have been glorious. We have given much blood to the dirt. And now as the final battle approaches, the town will gather to witness as our new warriors face, our most glorious champions. Every day is a sunshine day. For the gods shine their light down upon us. We'll soon see if you're truly the warrior that the good doctor says you are. And now, a little dinner entertainment. Watch, eat, enjoy. I know what you're thinking. I should kill everybody here, escape with my friends and never look back. Am I right? No. Are you sure? When I kill you, and I will kill you, I want everyone to see it. I want a sold out fuckin' show. And you think the gods will allow that to happen? Someone has to pay for every limb you've hacked off, every life you've snuffed out. When I bring you down like the rabid dog you are, your pathetic little gods won't be able to do shit about it. Since you're so smart, I'll level with you. All that god stuff, complete and utter bullshit. Because no matter how you cut it, it's all about control. Control of the weak. Give people a higher power to believe in and they'll lap it up. If we make all these sacrifices, we'll be healthy, wealthy and wise. But you know as well as I do, if you really want something you've got to work hard for it, not get down on your your knees and pray. You see, I'm the only god in this here town. And I'm gonna live forever. The dirt runs red! The dirt runs red! Dinner's over! We're fucked. There's no way we can defeat these guys. Ugh, god. Don't worry your pretty little face. I'm thinking three steps ahead. Everything's gonna be cool baby, I got this. Where is she? Where the fuck are you taking Cassy!? Fuck you! Fuck you! Take me to Cassy. Please don't do this, it's not going to end well... Take me or I swear to fucking God, I will slice you from ear to ear! Okay. What the fuck? This? This is what you fed us? The Emperor, he calls it communion. Please, just go back to your cell. I won't say anything, I promise. What the fuck is wrong with you? I'm not one of them. I'm like you, I swear! The next thing I see had better be my friend. Cassy? Cassy! Oh god, Cassy! Amy! No Cassy! Cassy!! The town, the Council, the gods demand it. No the rules are clear. Without the Trinity, it does not count! Emperor, please. If the gods desire, they will spill their blood to the dirt in the gridiron but it would be a waste for them not... Fuck that shit! This bitch here can replace the servant girl, yeah? Emma stays here with me. Quiet, both of you. Though it's difficult to say it, Sam is right. The Trinity is crucial. With only two warriors, we can't continue. Exactly. I will fight. Emperor, it's been a long time since I've entered the Gridiron. Do me this honour and allow me to fight. The gods will be happy to see you return to action. What? Are you serious? You can't just join because! My agreement will stay with you my son. She's yours if she survives the battle. This is fucking bullshit! My decision is final. Fuck! What's wrong? That sister of yours tried to escape, but rather than pay the price, our little servant girl did. Oh, and that dyke friend of yours too. Oh. It all would've been fine and dandy except she has Driller wrapped around her fucking finger. So now because of her, you've gotta fight. You've gotta fight like a motherfucker! You hear me? You hear me!? Yes! Why are you doing this? Because my family deserves vengeance. And so do you. In this, the 100th year of the games, we stand below the gods, humbled. From the time our forefathers... There's something I need to say to you, Emma. You say I'm your enemy. I'm not. Our enemies are those fuckers out there who have pitted us against one another. Prosperity to all who truly believe. The more blood that we... I spent my whole life looking up to you. I know I can be a pain in the ass sometimes but I honestly couldn't have asked for a better big sister. On a daily basis. The fact that the... I just wanted to tell you that I'm sorry if I've hurt you. And I just wanted to let you know that I love you. To send us such fine warriors is a testament to their smiling down upon us. And so, we are here tonight to celebrate with a third and final battle. The third member of their Trinity, gave her blood to the dirt prematurely. She was a fine warrior, but never destined for greatness. But the gods have given us someone to take her place. A warrior who has spilled more blood upon this Gridiron than any who came before. The only warrior to earn his freedom. The dirt is dry! And thirsty for blood! You girls can do this. You both have the heart and courage of champions. Let's have some fun. Warriors, ready! Fight! - Driller! - Amy, you're a true warrior. I'm proud of you. Thank you. So the blood soaks into the ground and we rejoice. But must we stop here? Or must we do more to honour the gods who bless this town? You can't do that! Sam is right, time honoured traditions cannot be ignored, my Emperor. The dirt demands more blood, and these two sisters will provide it. Fuck you, you son of a bitch! Goddammit, Sam. Next time, it's a bullet. You understand me? I command it! Noooo!! Fuck you! What are you doing? Fight! Fight me! No. I'm tired of fighting you, Emma. On your knees! Get on your knees! The gods demand more blood. Are your gods satisfied now!? Noooo!!! That was great. That was great, honey. Emma, Emma, Emma, Emma! Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, come on sweetheart. Emma, Emma, You don't need to do that Today, we stand below our gods, humbled. Since the time our forefathers came from the old world to the new, they have blessed us with their wisdom and traditions, a ritual that ensures prosperity and health for all that believe. The dirt is dry!
