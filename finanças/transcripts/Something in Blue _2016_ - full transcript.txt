Jinan University Commencement Ceremony 2014 What do you want? You tell me. I've made it very clear in my text message that it's over between us. Just like that? A two-year relationship is only worth a text message? The text message is not the point. What is the point then? We're going down different paths. How is it different? People in America use iPhone. So do we! - I want to be a good lawyer... - Why not do it here? Why? You are too selfish. It's all about you and no one else. Don't you ever come to find me again. This is the live broadcast of the first quarterfinal for the 2014 World Cup. Here comes Germany. Missed a sitter like that? Darn. What a bunch of losers! Just like you. When was the last time you scored with a woman? Darn it. I bet a thousand on the French. You mean the thousand you borrowed from me. I thought the French were supposed to have a good lineup. They need a winger to attack. The coach has no idea about offense-defense balance. Darn it! - Missed another one like that? - Shut up, okay? What? You want a quiet pub? Let it go. Don't take it personally. I'm sorry. Are you all right? Sorry about that. Darn. Hey, the Germans scored. Well, I blew it. I lost a thousand just like that. Says the guy wearing a Dutch jersey. What the heck did you expect? But that girl's phone number was definitely worth the loss. Let's hope it is not a fake number. Who cares? Just don't forget to pay me back. Look, Wen Hao. It's the guy we just met. Give him a light. Which team did you root for? France. You? Germany. SoSo, I'm Lao K, the guy... You seem more energetic in person. Well, this is a blind date. Why don't you say something? This is my first blind date. What is the guideline? I used to think that blind dating was an impersonal interaction. You see, it's two human beings sitting together, like a job interview, examining each other's reproductive capabilities. - But I've come around now... - Sorry, I need to take this. Hello. Yes. Keep the Hulk for me. I'll pick it up later. Okay. Thank you. - You can go if you're busy... - It's okay. Did you see that girl by the door when you came in? Don't turn to look. She has been following me for a while. She just won't believe that I'm not a lesbian. Do you think I look like one? - Honestly, you seem... - Listen. Do me a favor. Say something. Anything. And I'll pretend to be interested. Please. In quantum mechanics, there is a concept called "quantum entanglement," which is basically a term to describe the working principle of a quantum computer. Have you heard of it? According to quantum theory, each action leads to different possible probabilities. If the solutions to Schrodinger's equation are linearly dependent, there would be a certain amount of connections made between two universes. For example... From Qingdao to Guangzhou, I've sold cellphones and furniture. I've been a home tutor, and I've even been a construction worker. Tonight's interview is for a digital marketing job. I'll just give it a try. It is a traditional Chinese virtue to respect the old and cherish the young. Please offer your seat to those in need. Thank you. How can I not work? There are only 6,000 yuan left in my account. Every month, I have to pay 600 yuan for my rent and 100 yuan for my cell phone bill. And transportation costs me another 200 yuan. Even if I only eat pork hock and rice every day, I'd still have to spend at least 1,500 yuan per month. My savings will only last me two months. Zhang Chao, don't mess around. Get going. Come back, Wen Hao. Chop some spring onions for me. Back in the day, when I was an apprentice to a Japanese chef, I was referred to as "the Spring Onion Master." That's way too much oil for the stir-fried vegetables. This is the Shandong way. You are such a downer. You know what? Your face is like this bitter melon. Cheer up, man. I lost my job and my girlfriend. I feel like the world's biggest bum. It'll be fine. Honestly, I'd rather be unemployed. Look at me. Running around selling credit cards all day, telling those old farts a card will make their lives easier. Not to mention some morons I've met. Just because I treat them nicely, they think they are big shots. I wish I could quit my job. It's better to be jobless. You know, working in my mom's factory is like being jobless. Right now, my life is exactly like this vegetable stem. Spiritless and limp. Let me tell you. You are more like this mud carp, black as ink and unlucky. Learn something from the clams. Be humble and keep it real. A little bit salty though. Let's change the subject. Cheers. That girl, do you think she's pretty or not? Which girl? The one we met at the pub the other day. At the pub... I asked for her number. That schoolgirl? Do you think she has a boyfriend? I don't think so. She was at the pub alone. Definitely no boyfriend. Or she was just dumped. I don't understand why you like her. Her forehead is as flat as a racetrack. And her breasts were as flat as a tack. Am I right, Zhang Chao? It's such a drag. It takes so much effort in dating, - but it always leads to a bitter end. - She dressed so plainly. And she wore no makeup. I bet she's an undergraduate at a nice school, like SCNU or SYSU. Besides, her number is from Jiangmen. I am going to look her up. Hey, you can't use this as a leeway when you're losing the game. Isn't her name Shu Shu? How the heck should I know? She's not my friend. You're lucky that I don't pick up girls anymore. Otherwise, you would not stand a chance. But seriously, how innocent is she to drink alone in a pub? I think I found her. Is this her? As if. How can you find her so easily? It can't be wrong. Gosh. She is just as pretty as her picture. Yes. She looks the same as in her picture. But I wouldn't use the word "pretty." - You suck, Zhang Chao. - Yes. I'm betting on the Germans to win tonight. She's truly beautiful. Look at those short buildings. That's SYSU. The ones with the lights on are the dormitories. But don't assume their lights are on because they are studying. I bet you, they are playing Dota. - Do you want a popsicle? - No. I had a dream last night. Guangzhou was flooded. Not the "light shower" kind of flood, but the kind of flood that had inundated Atlantis. Strangely, nobody cared. People went to work and went shopping as usual. Some died of asphyxiation. Some were crushed by high water pressure. People were oblivious to the deaths. I was the only one struggling to escape, swimming to the surface. Do you know what is 3 m under the bitumen? The Ninja Turtles? No, it's another layer of road. From the Song Dynasty. Between the ancient people's lives and ours, there is always a 3 m distance. The Nijigen you mentioned, does it mean this? Why don't we speak Cantonese? It's so bloody strange that as Cantonese, we're talking in Mandarin. Over a decade ago, I left Guangzhou to study. Back in the day, people who didn't speak Cantonese here would be despised and bullied. Now that I'm back here, everybody is discussing some crap about preserving Cantonese and traditions. It's so stupid. Let's just speak Mandarin. The way you speak Cantonese is cringey. You say it's cringey, I say it's fine. Cantonese is a "malat" language. Mandarin is better. Malat? What are you on about? That's not how it's used. How is it used then? Just like the way you walk, slouched and shuffling. That is "malat." Shit. Come here, Shao Hua. The designer expressed his dissatisfaction with you multiple times during the interview, and you didn't get the hint. His feelings were hurt, and you did nothing about it. You are a journalist. How can you be so insensitive? I don't see any problem. I asked all the necessary questions. So is your job simply to ask questions? Is a journalist only meant to come up with some questions beforehand and read them out to the interviewees? Did you get material-worthy answers? I did the very best I could. He lives in the suburbs. It took me three transfers on the metro and two bus rides to get... Who cares? Don't tell me this. I only care about the results. I don't see the problem. Hello, Ms. Pearl. I'm Wang Shao Hua from City News. Wang Shao Hua? That sounds like a fake name. I would like to conduct an exclusive interview with you. This play is given the title, The Most Lady: Post 70s, 80s, and 90s. Why is it named "The Most Lady"? It came from my radio program with the same name. Also, "the most" can be interpreted in many ways, such as "the most charming lady," or "the most intoxicating lady," or "the most desirable lady" et cetera. - There are plenty of... - Possibilities. Possibilities, right. There are countless meanings. That's why I call it "The Most Lady." What message do you want to convey through this play? Actually, it is more than just a play. It is a mix of talk show and stage play... It is said that women want love and men want to make love. Because sex is all men want. A man will always fall for an 18-year-old girl whether he is 18, 28, 38, 98, or even 108 years old. His age won't make any difference. Why? Because an 18-year-old girl has no problem having sex. That's why we'll see Hugh Hefner, a man in his late eighties, walking down the streets with some 18-year-old beauty. That won't strike us as odd. We won't walk up to him and ask, "Hey Hugh, can you still get it up?" Why? Because men have a secret godbrother. With this brother's help, elderly men can go out and have fun too. What's this brother's name? Viagra! I didn't know women knew it too. This godbrother is known as Viagra. It gets a man's little brother up. The godbrother, Viagra, does help out a man's little brother a lot of times. Then, with this godbrother, a man can always stay young and vigorous, even in his eighties. Shakespeare's distant cousin, Shakespoor, once said, "A woman won't truly know about love and lovemaking if she has never been fooled by love." Free bus passes for seniors. Guangzhou Movie Theater President Zeng, the loan product we're promoting now... - Have some tea. - Thank you. It is of great value. The interest rate may seem a bit high, but unlike the other banks, we don't charge any handling fees. Hello, Desheng. It has been a long time. What is that noise? No, I'm not busy. How can I help? For years, I've been asking you for the thousands of yuan you owe me. Now, I'm almost embarrassed to ask again. I need to take this. Hello. Sorry, we don't need it. I've had enough of your daily cold calls. Please don't ever call this number again. Goodbye. - Sorry, I wasn't talking about you. - It's okay. It's fine. As for your loan product, it's best to put it aside for now. - I'm keener on collecting debts. - It's all right. - I'll call you when this gets done, okay? - Sure thing. President Zeng, how many employees do you have? Several dozen. How about I get each of them a credit card? How does that sound? Here is your steak, sir. What are we doing later? Let's go to the spa. Come on. Spas, facials, catching up with friends... Your schedule is as busy as Barack Obama's. It's not like we dine out all the time. But whenever we are out, you have to eat something fancy, something costly. A dozen times per month, and that's a few thousand already. Sweetie, have you thought about it? This costs more than your salary. I've been going out less often since your last complaint. Besides, can you name a time when I pushed you too hard? With your poor salary, it's unlikely for you to save much. You might as well treat yourself better, right? Sure, order one more steak. Pick the most expensive one. - Go ahead. - Let's order the most expensive cut. Excuse me. How's the steak? Not bad. It's not cheap. You know that the food here is never worth the price. Not to mention the weather. I'm getting burned. What a day. It was you who wanted to come here and shop at MUJI. We're in Baiyun District, and a suburban district is always sunny. Lousy food. Lousy weather. Why are you walking so fast? What then? Do you want to stay here? Wait up. The next station is Huangsha. Please change here for Metro Line 1. The next station is Huangsha. Marriage is good. I'm okay with that. It's okay to have a kid too. I like kids. But getting married next year as my mom and girlfriend requested, it's way too soon. I am only 25 years old, so darn young. How can we waste our wonderful youth on marriage? What a great hideout. I was told this place is quite exclusive. Not many books. Even fewer customers. When I worked in the Observatory, I used to study binary star systems in the early universe. You've heard of that, haven't you? It means two stars orbiting a common center. One of the two stars is usually a compact star, which can be a neutron star, a black hole, and so on. So is there a white hole to spit out things swallowed by a black hole? A white hole only exists theoretically so far. It seems no white hole has ever been observed yet. Some even say the universe we live in was spat out by a white hole in the past. Then is the wormhole their kid? Actually, there is no big difference between science and art. For example, in quantum mechanics, there are countless possibilities in the quantum world. When the observers appear, the countless possibilities become a single determinacy. Science is deducing "countless" possibilities from the "single" determinacy. Art is similar. We start from a single reality and end up with countless creations. There is a race called "The Watchers" in the Marvel Universe. They can see the past, the present, and the future of the universe. However, one of them was killed recently. Perhaps by Fury. Science is risky in the Marvel Universe. That's true. Just look at Hulk. So why did you quit the observatory for a nomadic lifestyle instead? I'm an underground artist, okay? Underground art is closer to the quantum world's countless possibilities than astronomy. An underground nomad then. It's better than me, though. Savings, financial management, and gold investment. Funds, insurance, credit cards. Would you like to open an account, sir? If you spend 99 yuan or more monthly, we'll give you a free cell phone. Take a chill pill. No work, no money. But would you believe me if I told you I quit my job this morning? Does that make me "quantum" now? School Block 1 What's with your legs? Don't worry about them. - Are you all right? - This is my fifth time here. I waited in the library and in a classroom the whole afternoon. But I still haven't seen Shu Shu yet. - She's... - You are a rather professional stalker. Gosh, there are so many schoolgirls. Perhaps Shu Shu is among them. Yes, right. She is a senior, okay? She's in her senior year? Now, keep an eye out for her today. - I can't feel my bloody legs anymore. - My feet hurt. Just go and stall her if you see her. - Please? - Okay. Will you? Wen Hao, do you actually think this is worthwhile? Any chance is better than no chance at all. That's nice. After you find her, what's next? I'll ask her to join the three of us and watch the soccer match. Do I have to have dinner with your mom again? Don't you find your behavior quite bizarre? No. Not really. She probably thinks you're some kind of pervert. As if we all owe you a favor. I disagree. Even if she actually becomes your girlfriend, - then what? - You go home every week. - Have you ever thought about it? - What if she gets used to that? We'll just have dinner - at yours every week. - It should be okay. All right, wishful thinker. Hey, look at the crowd down there. How the heck can we find her? Besides, what if she actually skipped class today? - Aren't we even more pathetic? - The girl in pink, does she look like Shu Shu? There. I feel like calling out her name. Should I? Are you serious? Yes. I want to give it a shot. - Don't... - Shu Shu! Hey, you should let us flee first. Look at the crowd. How embarrassing. And even if she was Shu Shu, what would you do? Would you go down there and tell her you're a stalker? My mom has gone to Greenland to see the aurora recently. She has been on an icebreaker, and we couldn't reach her for days. I don't know how she's doing. She went to Mt. Everest the year before and got middle ear barotrauma due to the low pressure there. She was hospitalized for over a week back in Guangzhou. But she never stops traveling around the world, regardless. Because this is her childhood dream, you know. My dad has been away on a business trip as well. To him, traveling means going on business trips. Whenever he has days off, the only place he wants to visit is his hometown, Hainan. As if Hainan is the best place in the world. I do envy them though. My mom always has some new places to explore. And my dad always has a hometown to come back to. As for me, every place is the same. It's as if I belong nowhere. She took a 100 yuan note and threw it at me. She accused the bank I worked at of bullying their customers. She wanted to teach us a lesson by asking me to deposit her 100 yuan one yuan at a time. I zoned out for a minute before telling her there was a long line behind her. But she didn't care. So I had to deposit the 100 yuan, one by one. After I had done around 20 one-yuan notes, our branch manager came back and saved the day. He spoke with that lady in his office. The trouble was solved afterward. It just occurred to me that perhaps that lady has had a crush on our branch manager for ages. She only stirred up trouble to get his attention. Am I right? What life lesson do you think it taught us? So darn complicated. I can think of a swear word for it. What? Shit. Shit. Borges once said, "There is a labyrinth which is a straight line." All this stuff on the board is simply a waste. Now what? Are you now employed or unemployed? Or has your job become like Schrodinger's cat? What kind of dessert do you want? "We don't have any made-up desserts." "Order by telling us the name of the dessert word for word." That's how Chinese children lose their imagination. You are overthinking it. A pineapple shake then. Those... Is that white fungus? Why is there antenna-looking stuff on it? What the heck? Does it taste good? It is quite bland. Why is this dessert so weird? I rarely get a day off. Must you two morons drag me to this crappy music festival? - Why are we here? - Don't be a buzzkill. I've never heard of those bands. You are supposed to keep your buddy company on the weekend, and also, help him find his dream girl. Not in his dreams though. I know she'll be here these few days. I got good intel from her Weibo. You've been looking for her for almost half a year. How would you find her in such a big world? - Don't be so dramatic. - It has only been four months. Go and see if she's on this bus. Have fun. Bye. Do you know who is the founder of Rock and Roll? The Beatles? Bob Dylan? Tell us. It's Beethoven. You think he wrote symphonies. But it was all Rock and Roll. Sure, whatever. It's not overly crowded today. It should be easy to find Shu Shu. Sale, Stall Area The Other Shore Music Festival Hello, I'm a reporter from City News. Can I ask you a few questions? Yes, sure. Are you guys from Guangzhou? Yes, that's right. What are your thoughts on this music festival? Just look at the band on stage. They look like a bunch of comedians to me. And the lawn here is nasty too. The lawn, you mean this environment... - There's plenty to improve. - It can be improved. In our time, the spirit of Rock and Roll is long dead. There are only role-playing singers, and the audience whines all the time. What is left apart from this? I've been puzzled by the name of that band for a while. Whatever does "Yumbi" mean? Go and find Shu Shu for me. Hurry up. Where? I don't care. Search through every single one of them. Find girls in a ponytail. She likes wearing a ponytail. There are girls in ponytails everywhere. I'll be away for a while. Take your time. Where are you going? Walking around. She likes to dress in light colors. There are girls in light colors everywhere. Hi. Where are your friends? They are over there. You like this band too? Yes, they are all right. We're children who are singing Children who are singing In the sunshine, up the banyans There are our smiling faces We're children who behave Children who don't want to grow up In the fading memories Has your look changed over time? We're children who are singing Children who are singing In the twilight, we are singing Only for the amazing red sky We're children who behave Children who don't want to grow up In the night breeze, you will see I am roaming the world with my guitar Come on, sing along! We're children who are singing Children who are singing In the twilight, we are singing Only for the amazing red sky We're children who behave Children who don't want to grow up In the night breeze, you will see I am roaming the world with my guitar Hello. Yes. I've had a lot of job interviews these days. From marketing, project planning, teaching... Everything. But not a single job appealed to me. There was an e-commerce interview one afternoon. It's nothing impressive, just as you can expect. Maybe I can hang on for another month or two. What about you? How are you doing lately? To make a better living, I became a street vendor selling things both in the street and on the footbridge in Beijing. Sometimes, I would get shooed away by Urban Management officers several times in a single day. I remember a time when I was running away from the officers. It was drizzling and the road was very slippery. I fell over, and when I got up, there was this deep gash on my right knee, and flesh could be seen. Blood trickled down my knee to the sole of my shoe. This was the blood of a young man striving for a better life. Youth has nothing to do with age. It is youth that lights up our passion. It makes us believe in the future. It stops us from giving up. It helps us transcend our dreams. - Well said! - Thank you, everyone. Zhang Chao. - Have you finished your work? - Yes. How are you doing? Nothing has changed. I still work there. Zhang Chao, do you remember Zhang Hai? That chap is doing great now. He's running a logistics company and even bought a BMW. - Who? Zhang Hai? - Yes. Did he win the lottery? Who knows? Fortune favors fools. Do you remember Zhang Xiao Li? Yes. He was out of luck. He got a new job in a company that later went out of business. I always considered him unfortunate. That's true. How about Liu? Haven't heard from him in years. I don't know how he's doing. Fussing about, I guess. One must find out the right direction in life. Look at me. I've been job-hunting for several months. Yet I haven't got a clue. It all just seems so pointless, you know. You have the wrong attitude. Life is full of ups and downs. We rise and fall. Just listen to your heart instead of being controlled by your emotions. Otherwise, you would stress out. You don't know my situation. - I have... - More soup? I've changed so many jobs that I don't know where I'm headed anymore. Well then, Zhang Chao, let me ask you a question. What's your purpose in life? What is your goal? Life purpose? I don't have one. You haven't even figured that out? Don't clog up your mind with useless stuff and act meaninglessly. Stop chasing your tail all day. Otherwise, you would feel more tired and lost. All right. You can't come up with a goal within several minutes. Assess your situation first. What can you do now? What is right for you? Let me ask you, Zhang Chao. What do you want to do now? Write a novel. You've got to be kidding. About me writing a novel... Is it a good idea or not? Come on, the world is different now. Writers are no longer trending. Can you do coding? Just kidding. Hey, do you need anything else? No. Let's eat. What's so tasty about Mocha Frappuccino? Hey. Stop being like this. I'm fine. You are the one with problems. Whenever something upsets you, you pull a long face. How can we keep dating each other like this? Give me a break, okay? You just like to make a fuss out of nothing. This is what I'm talking about. You always decide on your own with no room for discussion. Like that job offer in Shanghai. You've made your decision before coming to persuade me. Did you even consider discussing it with me first? Why are you bringing this up again? I haven't decided yet. You're the one constantly complaining about my low salary. Now, they are offering good wages, as well as a more promising future. But you are still dissatisfied. What exactly do you want? Just tell me if you really don't want me to go. Then I won't go. Do you think I'll actually say no? Will you not resent me for the rest of your life? But if you do go, who will go to the movies with me? Who will get a Mocha Frappuccino with me? It's me. The man to my right is singing a patriotic song. The women to my left are dancing to an old romantic song. Why are we here at this hour? What is this Light Festival crap? My date blew me off, so I asked you out for company. Your girlfriend? It's none of your business. I see. It's the girl we met last time at the Music Festival. We are just friends. Stop suggesting otherwise. Just friends? You got dressed up just for a friend? I go to work like this every day, okay? My lips are sealed. Whatever, we are just friends. I also asked Zhang Chao out tonight. He just started a new job. He hardly has any spare time. Didn't he just quit his job? It's so ugly. Why would people display something so ugly? I'm bored. Me too. Let's find something else to do. Like what? I have no idea. The novel I've been writing... What? It's science fiction. But it's more than just science fiction. There are countless themes in it. Sociology, law, morality, and humanity. Here's the title, I, Robot, and God. How is this related to Isaac Asimov? Not Asimov. My novel has three layers of relations. The "I" refers to me as a human being. Then there's the robot and God. Am I right? God is the Creator who made human beings. Then human beings created robots. It's a father-son relationship under the patriarchy. The Creator is like our father. And human beings, we're like the fathers of robots, right? Right. So in my novel, there are these three intertwining plot lines. Robots, humans, and God. - And it all begins with two robots. - This tastes good. Do you know? Our universe is expanding at an accelerating rate. That is to say, all the galaxies we can see through telescopes are escaping from each other at an increasingly high speed. Scientists can't explain this phenomenon. So they came up with the idea of a uniformly distributed energy. This energy has a negative pressure, which counteracts gravitational attraction in the universe and pushes all things away. People don't know its name, hence it is now referred to as dark energy. Look at us. Although our paths don't seem to cross, we are moving forward smoothly in our respective tracks. I don't know how other people see affection. But I think there is a kind of connection between us. Without the influence of dark energy, would it happen to be so-called love? Now that the box is open, what do you think? Is Schrodinger's cat alive or dead? Why did you have to open the box? So the cat is flat-out dead? It may be alive in a parallel universe. Why didn't you answer my calls? Why didn't you tell me you have a girlfriend? What do you want? Do you think I have no feelings? What kind of person do you think I am? I have an interview now. Don't ever contact me again. Try a different way to see if it works. Slow down your pace. The faster you play, the less you will be able to observe. I think one needs a good state of mind. We should live a detached and simple life, and be self-poised, like the ancients. I'm sorry. Please continue. One's state of mind can be reflected by the piece of music one plays. The tranquility of the mind leads to a peaceful expression of music. A disturbed mind leads to a disturbed expression of music. Therefore, it's better not to play music when a player feels upset. One should only expect to play well when they are feeling peaceful. Hong I've told you not to call me again. I don't know what to say. There is no use trying to explain yourself to me right now. What can we do now? Hey, you. Stalker. Technically, I've been reading the whole time. You saw me and came over, so... Stalker. Hey. Schrodinger's cat is in this box. Open it and have a look. You can't say it's dead when it has never been alive. As long as I get to be with you, dead or alive, the cat is no longer relevant, right? Hello, Ye Hong. Where are you? Let's hang out tonight. You have a date with a girl? Which one? You have so many. All right, see you in a few days. Have you got a date for tonight yet? Who? Is it Peach Blossom? So you can't hang out with me? Okay. Perhaps I'll see you later then. It's fine, don't worry. See you. The next station is Tianhenan. The next station is Tianhenan. The next station is Tianhenan. The train is now arriving at Tianhenan Station. Please mind the gap between the train and the platform. McDonald's Hey. Wen Hao, where are you? I can't see you. Xiao Yi? I thought you were in the US. I'll go after the New Year holidays. You've cut your hair short. I cut it a long time ago. - It's pretty. - Thank you. Are you alone? No. I'm waiting for someone. And you? Same here. Hello. Are you here yet? All right, I'll come to meet you. Okay, bye. I've got to go. Xiao Yi. I have just finished writing a novel. Will you read it? The New Year is coming. Can I contact you again? - Seven, six, five, four, three, two, one! - Seven, six, five, four, three, two, one! - Lucy, I've been wondering. - What? If a girl suddenly stops posting things on social media, does that mean she has a new boyfriend? Sounds like she's broken up with someone. I don't think so. On Christmas Day, she posted, "I'm so happy today!" And there has been no update ever since. Even if she doesn't have a boyfriend, it's not like she'd date you. But I've been wooing her for more than six months. I don't want to give up. How can you call that wooing when she doesn't even know you? Forget about her. Go home and get a job. Besides, your mom wants you at the factory. Why not... To do what? Walking up and down in the workshop? Sweeping the floor? I've tried to do so many things these past few years, and they all went down in vain. Nobody likes me. It's so boring. My elementary school friends are always talking about futures, stocks, and candlestick charts. Nothing else. It is so boring. Would I be happy with Shu Shu? I don't know for sure. But sometimes, just picturing what she's doing satisfies me. Where she is, who she's with, and how we would spend our future together. All these make me happy. Am I escaping from reality? Maybe I am. But I don't consider it that way. I've never liked reality. Reality is subjective. I can't live without you I can't live I can't give anymore I can't live 2015 has begun. This year, I'm going to make a change. In the past 24 years, I've been living for others. For my parents, for my friends, for my teachers, for my employers, and for women. But that is all changed now. It is now 2015. I've lost everything. But I am very happy. From now on, I'll live for myself. I'm going to write novels. I'll make money. I'll fall in love. Who cares what others think? I'm going to have a real life, all for myself. Zhang Chao. I'm sure you'll make it. I have all the faith in you. Sometimes, hope isn't the reason that makes us keep trying. On the contrary, it is our determination that brings us hope. Give me a break, please. Enough already with all the New Year resolution crap. Enough with your nonsense, Zhang Chao. You changed your job hundreds of times in a single year. None of them lasted over three months. Who are you to talk about making money? Tell me, how the heck will you have a real life without cash? What's the point in writing all those novels? It's just a way to escape from reality. Have a think about that! As if you're any better. Why don't you have the guts to confess to that girl? Instead, you just whine to us. You don't even try to find a job. All you do is live off your parents. My life is a mess. So is yours. We're both living like losers. So what's the point of lashing out at each other? This is a vicious, never-ending cycle. What is even the point of arguing? Everyone has a wonderful life of his or her own. We shouldn't mind other people's business. Nor should we despise them. Just follow your own course. Build your own beautiful life. Isn't that great? I can't stand you anymore. Stop fooling yourself and others, okay? Take a good, hard look at yourself in the mirror. You'll follow your own course and build your own life for what? To become the biggest loser of them all? Who wouldn't want a girlfriend like Scarlett Johansson? But how? Ye Hong, you need to learn from Zhang Chao. I suggest you pick a silent moment to reflect on yourself. Think about what you'd like to do and what you can do at the moment. Think about what you've achieved so far. Then you'll have a better sense of direction in life. I hate all this "Chicken Soup for the Soul" crap. Perseverance prevails. Finding yourself means finding the meaning of life. Gosh, this is so annoying! Has it ever occurred to you? Maybe life has no meaning at all. Indeed, wooing Shu Shu made me look like a fool. But aren't you all also fools? What is the difference? Hypocrites! All you're doing is looking for excuses to cover up the real you. To hide your incompetence, indifference, and hypocrisy. Liars! What do you do with your spare time other than posting crap on social media? To show off. To pretend to live like some petite bourgeoisie. To pretend to be experts. Always talking about the government and political affairs. You don't know anything. Your lousy posts are about nothing but yourselves... What the heck are you talking about? So you're the only one living a real life? And everyone else is fake? You know, you live like a load of crap, okay? Big-time novelist, are you? How many readers do you have? Always spewing out that "be yourself" crap. You're just escaping reality. And you, "lead a wonderful life" and "follow your own course," my foot. Why don't you open your eyes and take a good look at the real world? Look at yourselves. Always blaming one another instead of dealing with your issues yourselves. It's always the society's fault, right? But what bigger enemy is there other than ourselves? We are meant to change and improve ourselves. Problems are like germs in the air. Can we possibly survive without it? We need to act! And you. You never stop yelling those slogans. Do you actually understand their meanings? Have you ever taken a moment to look at the things around you? Hey, I'm on your side. Come on. Let's drink and sing. Well, you accused me of living off my parents and doing nothing at all. Was I ever given any choice? It was my mom who decided my major would be civil engineering. I wanted to be a sous chef in Japanese cuisine. But my mom forced me to quit by threatening to kill herself. My family has disagreed with every single choice I've made. I want to go to Beijing and Shanghai too. I want to have all sorts of adventures. But I don't even get to choose my own bedsheets. What is the point of complaining at all? We think we have the freedom of choice. We get to make our decisions on work and women. But in the end, everything in life is chosen for you. Zhang Chao, pick a song! Go on! Young people nowadays are too pessimistic. Hi, may I ask you a question? What is your New Year's wish? May the New Year bring us all good health. Good health. - May the country be prosperous. - Good. - Wish you all the best in business. - All the best in business? Thank you. Do you have any New Year wishes? No. Do I have what? - Do you have any New Year wishes? - You mean, New Year wishes? - Yes, I have. Good health. - More money and good health. - May wealth come generously to you. - Sure, thank you. It was a cold call. Look at those flowers. How beautiful. I want to buy one. Those sunflowers are so pretty. By the way, New Year has come. Did you get a raise? It's a brand-new year. Not yet. Not yet? Did you think about what I just said? You need to make more money. You know me. I have a lot of needs. I buy just about anything nice I see. If you don't pay for me, I'll have to spend my money or even use my dad's card... Guangzhou, a city filled with flowers and happiness Sir, did you mean what you just said in the meeting? You've heard that I'm going to quit? Yes. Is it true? It's true. I've told President Cui. Why? Who still reads newspapers? During the meeting, everyone was looking at their phones. We publish newspapers, but none of us are reading them. So what is the point of working here? How long have you been in the news agency? Thirteen years. Thirteen years? If even you are changing career paths, what are rookies like me supposed to do? What to do? That's for you to figure out. As long as you still want to be a journalist, there will always be a spot for you no matter how the media changes. You will always be able to find a spot wherever you go. Okay. Where is your friend, the chubby one? Him? He's gone. - Gone? - Yes. He is a bit chubby. I think he must be even chubbier now. I thought he was... He was what? What about your friend with the glasses? He's gone too. He's gone too? Is it possible that they ran away together? No way. That book you got looks interesting. It's the kind of book he likes the most. Difficult and obscure. I can tell from the title. Let's have dinner later. Where? There's a restaurant on Wanfu Road named "something Ji." Anyway, they claim they make the best claypot rice in Guangzhou. I've heard about it. Is it good? It's not bad. Wouldn't it be too hot in this weather though? Maybe a little bit... I've had a new idea recently. We can organize an event, like a jogging activity. We can start at 2 a.m. Think about it. Two o'clock in the morning, when the city is at its quietest and truest form, we'll host such an event to record this city. We can also document our conditions and feelings at that moment. You and all your fancy ideas. It's not really book-selling. It's more like... Try the fish. The stocks are rising wildly these days. You work in a bank. Do you have any recommendations? As if he does. He's not even working at the bank anymore. That's right, I quit my job. Here's the thing. We've been spoiling our daughter since she was born. She always eats nice food and lives in big houses. A man needs to be very cautious when it comes to changing his job. - That's true. - Otherwise, how can he support his family? Let me tell you something. A wrong career can kill a man. A wrong man can ruin a girl. You change your work so frequently. You'd better get a good one next time. Otherwise, how are you going to give my daughter a good life? My girlfriend's parents were questioning me over dinner. That's totally Zhang Chao. He has so many weird ideas. Running at midnight? Is he mental? Wait. Don't hang up so quickly. Let's talk for a little bit longer. You haven't met your future parents-in-law. You have no idea. Do you know what's the worst thing for a man? A wrong career. As for a man with no career like you, when you meet your future parents-in-law... It's so cliché. Three hours for one meal. What a nightmare. I know. This is all for your sake and mine. I understand. I really do. I am still out, but I'll be back soon. I'm very tired. Let's talk later, okay? Bye. Mr. Chicken Soup. Hey. Mr. Chicken Soup. Hey! Mr. Chicken Soup! Hey! Mr. Chicken Soup! I think everyone has something to pursue. What I'm after is probably to find the authenticity of this world. However, when I really began my scientific research, I realized that I no longer possessed the passion needed to seek the truth of the universe. It turned out that what I preferred to do was to capture fixed moments through cameras. Imagine. All kinds of meaningless slices of life, including our daydreams, can now be captured in images, with the mysterious connections between them waiting to be found. Endless possibilities are waiting to be revealed. Reveal... I think everyone has something to pursue. What I'm after is to find the authenticity of this world. Baiyun Mountain Hiking Trail Jiulong Fountain Jiulong Fountain Jiulong Fountain I've got a new girl. I've gotten over Shu Shu. Fantastic. Let's drink. Wen Hao, you've said that so many times. I watched Sleepless in Seattle with her the other day. And she fell asleep. It's insane. It's pretty normal. A lot of people fall asleep watching that movie. You want the girl to be hot and smart. That's insane. What about your girlfriend? Nothing has changed. It's just that recently, she won't shut up about Louis Vuitton, Gucci, and Hermes. I don't know if that's like a hint about my low salary. Excellent! I've recently written a new piece. It's a play. That's something. The title is Macbeth. I didn't know you were bloody Shakespeare. It's not like that. Yes, he wrote Macbeth. But I've revised it a lot. - Localization. Do you know what I mean? - Gosh... Sounds amazing. Should I read it to you now? Dude, eat the fish before it gets cold. I'm freaking starving. "Out! Out! Brief candle!" Do you know what you are talking about? Brief condom? Not condom. It's "candle." Do you know what that is? It means candlelight. - "Brief candle," brief candlelight. - I know. Brief condom. Why don't we stop climbing by foot? Let's grab a trolley instead. Do you know what's the hardest part of going uphill? What? Bumping into guys like you? The worst part is now. You're too tired to continue, yet too proud to quit. Give me a hand. Hand those over. I'll carry the heavy stuff. Thank you. Now you won't be too proud to go downhill. Come on. Let's stop. The view is pretty nice here, - more or less like the view at the top. - Why? We're almost there. Don't give up so easily. What do you mean by giving up? I never wanted to get to the top. So this is not a failure. It's more of a... A what? Let me think about it. The view here is not bad at all. I fell in love with someone else. I fell in love with another woman. We were seeing each other. And now, she has left. Who is this other woman? She's not some other woman. Just... A woman. I used to find the soap operas super cheesy and melodramatic with all the "I'll be happy as long as you are" crap. But now, thinking about her being all alone makes me hope that she can meet someone who understands her and cherishes her. Someone who can take care of her. As long as I can hear about her from time to time like an old radio, that will make me very happy. But you've become as cheesy as her. I don't understand why you had to break up with her. You wouldn't understand. Actually, neither do I. "Life is but a walking shadow." What are you doing, Zhang Chao? Shut up! "A poor player that struts and frets his hour upon the stage." "And then is heard no more." The cuffs of your pants are so cool. "It is a tale told by an idiot. Full of sound and fury, signifying nothing." Is that all? I know it's none of my business. I know you both hate me. I know I've made many mistakes. I'm not asking you to forgive me. Rest assured. I don't even know why I'm here. I didn't have a lot of choices. I didn't choose to meet you. I know you think I'm a jerk. But I knew from the moment we met that I was meant to fall in love with you. I didn't choose to meet you. I didn't choose to like you. I didn't choose to like the both of you. Why am I the one to blame? Sorry, I haven't been sleeping well. My head hurts. I'm confused. I'm sorry. I just want to do something right. I still like you a lot. I still like you a lot. I will confess this to my girlfriend. Why don't you just tell me about your strengths as a copywriter? I've written a novel. But I haven't finished it yet. Lately, I've been working on a play that I'm about to finish... So it isn't finished? No, but almost. It's still unfinished then. Young man, you'd better think it over. Once you've figured out what your strengths are, you can come here again. Otherwise, it's only a waste of your time and mine. What the fuck, man. What the fuck.
