There lies a sleepy little village, with the biggest Christmas spirit. Look for it on a map, and you won't be able to find it. It is said that only those in need of the village's particular joy, can find their way to its quiet, welcoming streets. "And once these special visitors arrive in this magical little place, they experience a holiday season like no other, and are reminded of who they really are and the true joy and peace that is the meaning of Christmas." Did you really read this book when you were my age? Only about a thousand times, and now, it belongs to you. An early Christmas Eve present. Because you, my sweet darling girl, are a very special person with a very special gift, and you know what that means, right? I will grow up and do very special things? That's right. As long as you follow your heart and your dreams, you cannot fail. But all of Talia's dreams are filled with pirates and fairies, sir. Hey, my dreams are fun! Look who it is. Well, happy holidays, Anderson. Thanks. I wanted to ask if Talia could come out and play with me. But my dad just got home from his work trip. He's reading me my new book. You should stay and listen. Actually, your timing is perfect. I was just about to whip up some hot chocolate for us. Talia, why don't you build a cozy fort and you can read it to Anderson? "The village is ruled by a beautiful fairy queen and her handsome king, but everything you want was there, you just had to ask." I bet I could find Wunderbrook on a map. All I'd need is my compass. No way, it's impossible. It says so right on the first page. You have to have "forgotten who you are and forgotten how to dream". Whatever that means. Besides, the evil witch would chase you and force you out of town, and then the princess would give you a kiss on the cheek and grant all your secret wishes. Secret wishes and kisses? I don't remember that part of the story. Because I'm making up my own parts. - Thank you. - Thanks. You're welcome. Talia is going to be a writer when she grows up, because she's always daydreaming and making things up. Yeah, I'm going to be famous, and everyone will read my stories. I know you are. So, what are you going to be when you grow up, Anderson? Our teacher says I should be a doctor. I think that sounds like a wonderful idea. Are you okay, Daddy? Are you still tired from your medicine? A little, but nothing to worry about. I'm heading upstairs now. Don't get into any trouble down here. Okay, love you. I love you, too. What's that flyer say? "Good for one free week at the Gingerbread Inn, offer will not expire, transportation provided. Where is it? It says "Close by," but close by to what? I guess it's a mystery, just like Wunderbrook. I bet nothing bad ever happens there. - Hi. - Hi. Do you really have to move away? Yeah, my mom's renting out the house. She wants to be closer to my aunt and uncle for a while. She says this house is too much for one person since my dad died. I got you something. It's so you can keep writing down all your stories. Thank you, Anderson. I love it. Maybe you can send me some in the mail? When you're feeling better. I have something for you, too. I wanted you to have your own copy, so you wouldn't forget about me. Did you hear that? Hear what? I thought I heard... Never mind. I'm going to miss you. Me too. As time continues to pass, dreams are often in danger of making way for reality, but where there is passion there is hope... For one dreamer at least. Hey! - Hi! - Tal! I'm so excited to see you! Looks like your creative juices are flowing. Oh, no, not exactly. Just some exhilarating inventory. Well, the store looks fantastic. Thanks so much for hosting my event, and so close to Christmas. Are you kidding? We have a literary sensation in our midst. Come look. I have a surprise for you. You ready? Ta-dah! Oh! "Sensation" might be a bit of a stretch, but I appreciate your enthusiasm. I don't suppose your publisher gave you any feedback on my manuscript? They just got back to me. They said it was cute, but they don't think your stories are a fit for their brand. They prefer edgier material. Right. Okay. Well, thank you for trying. Yeah. Look. Someone's in your reading chair. That's where Miss Talia reads us her stories about Mr. Snowflake. Sloane, this is my neighbor, Ryan. And your biggest fan, I see. Today, Sloane is going to read part of her book. She's a real professional writer. Talia wondered if she would ever find her voice, or those who would appreciate her gifts, while unaware a friend from the past was searching for answers of his own. Chief, hey, it's, uh, it's Anderson. You gotta get somebody to cover my next procedure. No, I'll be okay, I just need a couple of days to clear my head and get some rest. I'll keep you posted. I'll be back soon, I promise. Thanks, Chief. Doubting oneself does not make for a happy heart, especially when that inner conflict spreads to the loving bond between two souls. I got some gifts for the nieces and nephews, I just need to find something for your parents. Any thoughts? Keith? You don't need my two cents. I'm sure whatever you pick is fine. Okay. Did you remember to call the plumber? The leak is getting worse. I'll do it myself. Where have I heard that before? As Diane contemplated if this was her last Christmas with Keith, another soul was desperately holding onto something that was already gone. Bea, honey, I'm home. How was your day? I went grocery shopping. I picked up some of that almond milk you like. So fancy. Remember when it was just half and half? Oh, I ran into your friends from the book club. They sure miss having you around. Little did these struggling souls know the forces that would bring them all together were already in motion. Why bother, you already know what they're going to say. "Thank you for your interest, but we are unable to proceed with your material at this time." like it's really no joke. Did you say something? Oh, sorry, no, I'm just talking to myself. Have we met? Sorry, never mind. You know, I do that a lot because I read quite often and so between all the characters I envision in my head, and all the people that come through this door, there's just a lot going on, right? I also talk a lot. Talia? Is that you? From Rockford Elementary? - Anderson? - Yeah. - What?! - Yeah! - Hi! - Hi! Wow! How long has it been? Not since you and your mom moved away, right? When did you come back to Seattle? I moved back into my family's house after I got my Master's in writing. Cool. I wish I'd known, I would have invited you out for coffee or something. Oh, you know, and I actually kept meaning to look you up, but I didn't think you'd remember me after so long. Of course, I remember you. So, which section is yours? Do you use a nom de plume? More like a nom de calculator. This is actually my store. - Oh. - Yeah, which, you know, requires a surprising amount of math, and sadly, not as many clever turns of phrase. Ah, well, that's too bad. I always liked reading your stuff. Not that running your own store isn't also fantastic. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - It is, no, I just, yours was the only fiction I ever really got into. Oh, that's nice. Well, um, I still dabble, of course, right? In fact, publishers are considering my work as we speak. Cool. What about you? What about you, what do you do? I am a surgeon. - Oh! - At Seattle Medical. But I'm taking a bit of a vacation. Oh, hence the need for reading material? Yes. Okay, so, what are you in the mood for? Can I offer you a nice juicy mystery, or... Maybe something a little more uplifting would be a better distraction? Just what the doctor ordered? - Something like that. - Okay. So, what you have planned for the holidays? My mom's away this year, but I have other plans. Loads of plans. Lots. Great, well, we should do that catch-up after the holidays. I would love that. Yeah. Um, here, put in your contact info. Ah, still ordering me around like old times, huh? Some things never change. All right. Thank you. Here you go. I think you'll like this one, it's on me. Well, thanks. Text me, and we'll get that catch-up on the books. Yeah. Sounds good. - All right. - Okay. - See ya. - Bye. "I still dabble?" Good grief, Talia, you're so lame. Hey, Mom, guess who I saw today. Anderson! Yeah, from back in the day. Do you remember him? Oh. Single? I have no idea, we didn't get into all that. I know, I wish we could spend Christmas together, too. Yes, for sure, absolutely. Okay. I love you, too. Bye. Oh. Hello? Hi, Robyn? It's Talia! Um... I know it's been a while, but I was just wondering what you were up to for the holidays? Oh, dear. I'm afraid this isn't Robyn. This is Judy, and you've reached the Gingerbread Inn. I'm sorry, the Gingerbread what? The Gingerbread Inn, dear. I'm assuming you called about the special getaway promotion? Deluxe private room, three home-cooked meals a day, access to all festival activities. That... Wow, that sounds lovely, but I was actually just trying to call my friend. Well... maybe it's fate. Those who need it most tend to find their way to us, and you're in luck. We only have two openings left for this season. Do let us know soon if you change your mind. Okay, great, thank you, uh, but I will say, um, I probably will just stay put and celebrate with my friends, but I do appreciate the offer. Very kind. Okay. Thank you. Bye. Hmm. Hey, Jenny, it's Talia! Yeah, hey, I was just wondering what you were up to this week? Oh, that's right, yes, I forgot you were with Rick's family. Okay. All right, well, have fun. Bye. Hi, we spoke earlier this evening. Yeah, you know, I've been thinking, and I changed my mind. I'd be thrilled to accept your offer. Where in the world am I? Wunderbrook? Be right there! Welcome to the Gingerbread Inn. I'm Judy, and I'll be your host. Is everything okay? I don't know. I'm having major deja vu. You know, this place looks a lot like the... Never mind, never mind. It's just my imagination working on overdrive again. Ignore me. Okay, I'm clearly exhausted. I was, like, nodding off in the car ride over here. Thank you for arranging that, by the way. We are delighted to have you. Please... accept your welcome basket. Oh! I asked you three times to pack an extra charger. Why didn't you email me the task list? Talia, meet Diane and Keith, two of our other guests. Oh, and this is Charles. My husband, Miles, is bringing you some spare clothes. They're not exactly fashionable, but... Oh, I appreciate the generosity. I didn't expect to be staying, so I just brought my fishing gear. Oh! Jake, what's the matter? A car was detoured our direction on the way up the coast, and the driver says it's running funny. I told him to come on over. He's grabbing his suitcase. Anderson? Seriously? Yeah, I think? Hi. Hi. You know each other? Uh, yeah, but we haven't seen each other for like almost 30 years. Yeah, and now it's twice in the same week. He's stalking me, it's fine. Sounds like kismet to me. Really? Well, I'll go see if I can figure out what's going on with that detour and take a look at your car. I'm sort of the Jake-of-all-trades around here. - Get it? - Yeah. Well, that would be great. I'm sure I'll figure it out by the morning. Well, gotta get going, lots to do. Oh, and in the meantime, I've got an extra room for you. I've got some lovely desserts in this other room. I'm just going to turn in. I should probably get some work done. - I'll be upstairs, okay? - Okay. I don't want to get in his way, but I'm not very hungry, so I'm just going to go read. And then there were two. This way to the dining room. Delicious hot cocoa for you? - Oh. - Yeah, thank you. Well, I'm hoping to figure out what's wrong with the car. I'm aiming to get out of here as soon as I can. I'm sure he will. Excuse me. So, I thought you were stay-cationing in Seattle with loads of plans. Oh, yeah, uh, I may have embellished that a little bit. Ah. Okay, you have to admit that it's a wild coincidence that we're both here, right? Okay. It was synergy. Ah, I thought the word was "kismet". Only five visitors this year. Not a ton, but we can make it work. Maybe. Assuming they have a successful stay with us. I can't wait to meet the new people. I have so many questions. I told you, Izzy, you're not to bother the guests. I won't, Mom, I promise. I don't know why you're all so excited. Interlopers, that's what they are. I wish they'd all just stay away and leave us be. Oh, Mildred, I know it's hard for you to forget the past. Maybe this season we can change how you feel. Now, we only have until the conclusion on the Night of Wunder, on the 23rd, same as every year, to get everyone sorted. We all have our roles to play and not much time to do it. So... let's get to it. Ho! Ho! Ho! And so, Mildred reluctantly pondered her role in the fate of this year's guests. What obstacles could she lay in their paths? Apparently, the road to the cabin is going to be closed longer than they thought, and my car is still out of commission. - Please. - Thank you. Yeah. So, I'm going to try and book a Ride-share so I can take off. You sure you want to leave so soon? There's something in the air here. Keith, the plumber said he could start on the repairs today. Our house flooded, which is why we had to clear out last minute. Then I found a flyer for this inn. It was in the mailbox without a stamp. It was the oddest thing. What about you, Charles? How did you find your way here? Oh. Boredom. I've fished every fishing spot there is to fish in Idaho. You came all this way to fish? And to think. Yeah. I got a little lost on the way... found my way here somehow, Judy offered me a room. I figured I'd better stay put before I really got lost. How about you, Talia? Well, I called the wrong number and Anderson got re-routed on a detour, so... It's kind of like a force drew us all here or something, right? You haven't changed a bit. That overactive imagination still working double-time. Hi! I'm Izzy. Judy and Miles are my parents. Can I show you all around before you get started with your day? My mom said it's okay. Oh, our very own tour guide! I'll pass. I'm not in the mood for a tour. - Sounds good to me. - Yeah. Keith? I should finish my brief. There's so many places you can visit. There's Mildred's Miracle Tavern. It's the nicest restaurant around. Even though Mildred isn't always the nicest person around. Don't tell her I said that! I swear, it's the oddest thing. I just know I've been here before. Impossible. I've never seen you, and I never forget a face. My mom says it's like a super power. Oh, well, that's impressive. Okay, but continue, Izzy, this is so exciting! And it'll get even better. The tree lighting is tonight. The official start of our Wunder Week. "Wunder Week"? Okay, I know I've heard that before. Me too. Maybe a client... What do you and Keith do for work? Oh, we're both lawyers. I just made partner at my firm, and Keith is a public defender. What about you, Anderson? What do you do? I just became an attending, so I supervise my own group of residents. Surrounded by doctors and lawyers. Suddenly, I feel deeply inadequate. Aw, when you're a big, hot-shot author, you'll forget all about us. Aw, you sound like my dad. He passed away when we were ten. He was just my biggest cheerleader. I miss him every day. Hello there. You interested in something to go? Got anything on tap? Can I see a food menu? No substitutions, no exceptions. Don't worry, the only thing I'm allergic to is excessive pleasantries, and I don't think that's going to be an issue here. Goulash is my specialty. I'll have a specialty goulash then. To stay. Can I ask you something? This whole village looks like a Christmas elf exploded on it, but here, not so much. I used to go all out. For years, this was the place to beat for best storefront on Main Street. And then? I'm over it, as the kids say. You and me both. I wish it was January already. Oh, Charles! This is where you've been hiding. Not hiding. I just prefer to avoid the holiday hoopla. Oh. I can recommend the goulash. No substitutions. Sounds perfect. Three orders? Sure. So, did you have a good day? I did. I had a pleasant enough conversation with Mildred. She's... interesting. This place is nice. Yeah. Hey! Now, that is the kind of service you do not get in the city. It's a little too good. Keith would send it back. He'd be suspicious it'd been sitting out too long. How'd you kids meet? Oh, we were on rival quiz teams. I beat him during the round on the billboard charts of the '90s. So how'd you go from rivalry to romance? He said since I bested him in front of his friends, the least I could do was join him for dinner. After that, we were inseparable. Ah, young love at its finest. It's all so fleeting. Okay, we better get this in. It's the opening night of Wunder Week. Uh, hello? Can you guys hear me out there? Welcome, residents and guests. I'm Mayor Miles, and starting tonight, we kick off our Wunder Week. Inspiration for your next project? Oh, no, I can't even think about another project right now. I'm tapped... and honestly, the writing thing... isn't really happening for me. Well, that's a shame. I liked getting your stories in the mail. I was sad when you stopped sending them. You don't have to say that. Anyway, that was a lifetime ago. We should buy some souvenirs when the market opens. I don't know if this is a season we want to remember. Let's light it up! What do you say, folks? Okay! Three, two, one! This village would look even more picturesque if it were snowing, don't you think? What did I tell ya? In Wunderbrook a little magic goes a long way, but there's so much to do, and such little time. Chapter three. Only five days until the Night of Wunder deadline, and no one is making significant progress. Personally, I'll be glad when the tourists stop infesting our home. Every year, we give and give and are left with nothing in return. I'm sick of it. That's not true. We're left knowing we helped someone overcome a challenge in their life and move forward. The problem isn't just receding tourism. If we fail, visitors won't have the ability to find their way to us anymore. Oh, this looks good. Ready for the ultimate taste test? Oh, so glad you guys could make it. We have to guess the different flavors in the hot chocolate. Oh, fun! When we were first together, Keith and I used to try new restaurants once a week, and guess the ingredients and the spices in their dishes. Blindfolds at the ready. - Okay. - It's time to get tasting! All right. Thank you. - You first. - Me first. Definitely smells like coconut. Gold sprinkles? I was just about to eat this. Ah! Hey, you guys are cheating, I saw that. Weird. Your sister said she sent our gifts here, but the courier couldn't find the address. Maybe the village is unincorporated. Off-grid. That's odd. We already tried that one, Keith. Yep, I know. Just wanted a second taste, if that's all right with you? Okay, come on, Keith. Let's go, drink it up! Time's a-ticking. Okay, tastebuds on the prize, right? Right, so you'll listen to her. Yeah, because she doesn't treat me like an employee. Um... I'm going to go back to the inn. Thank you. You're doing better than I thought, Dr. A. Thanks. You can just call me Anderson, Izzy, and yeah, maybe I can add hot cocoa to the short list of things that I can make. Maybe you can make one for your girlfriend. Wait... Do you have a girlfriend? No, I am married to my work. What about you, Talia? You got a boyfriend back in Seattle? No, no, the only relationships I've been in recently are from the romance section in my bookstore. So you're both single! Um... well... Thanks. So, what kind of "wunder" ful joy did everybody get up to today? You'd know if you joined in. The festival is a community event and right now you're part of that community. I used to love the holidays. But it's just... it's not the same going through the motions without my Bea. Is that your wife? My high-school sweetheart. We were married 42 years. She did the bookkeeping at my shop. She was a whiz with numbers. Couldn't style her hair to save her life. Sounds like you made quite the duo. We did. She passed three years ago. Cancer. I'm sorry, Charles. I'd give anything to see my Bea again. Just for 10 minutes, even if all we did was bicker. She brought so much color to my life. You still deserve to experience joy, Charles. Did you know that Charles is a widower? Sorry? I just overheard him telling Judy. He misses her so much, and here I am, constantly at odds with Keith. I just... I feel so horrible. Do you want to come in for a minute? Yeah. I'm a pretty good talker, but I think I might be a better listener. Have a seat. So, what's really going on with you and Keith? Besides a flooded house. He never listens to me. He just tunes me out, like I don't even exist. I'm sorry, Diane. Maybe it's normal in a long-term relationship? I don't know. I filed for divorce. Oh. I haven't served him the papers yet. I wanted to wait until after the holidays, and I thought maybe this trip would be our last chance to reconnect, but he's... You know, enough about me. How about you and Anderson? I've been sensing a vibe between you two. No, no, no. We're just old friends. Hey, sorry, am I interrupting? - Oh, no. - We were just chatting. - Yeah. - Were your ears burning? Should they be? No, they shouldn't be. We were just... wondering where everyone was. And here you are! I mean, not just you, like, everyone, all the people. Well, I am here, and everybody else is going downstairs. Miles invited us for story hour. That sounds like fun. Yeah. - Shall we? - We shall. Okay. Let's go. Oh, this looks like story hour at my bookstore. What's a story hour? There are kids in my neighborhood whose parents struggle to find childcare. So they come, and they read books, and they hang out. I tell them some of my own stories, too. Well, I used to anyway. I would have loved something like that as a kid. However, um, this event isn't quite the same. Our tradition is to create an original holiday story every year. How does it work? We all take turns. Whoever has the microphone is the storyteller. Izzy, why don't you kick us off? Okay. There once was a lonely snowman, who wanted to meet a special snowlady and fall in love. Ooh... Uh, so, he joined an app... called the Icy Connection... Uh... hoping to find a match. And... all anybody ever wanted from him was advice on how not to melt. Hey, no, this is... This is from real-life experience from the five minutes that I spent on a dating app. Here, take it for a spin. Uh, no, no... - No, no, no, no - Here you go. Your turn. Hey, aren't you the pro? Fine, okay. Um... but when the snowman looked in the mirror, he wondered, sadly, why he could never frolic in the sun, and so began his existential quest to understand his elemental nature, for how could he ever partner with another snowy creature, knowing that a terrible, puddly fate awaited them both? Oh... Then what happened? Well, he moved to the North Pole, of course, where he would be safe to find love all year round! Oh! Brilliant! Okay, here. Okay, that is a tough act to follow. I know, right? Show-off. No, but, really, you have a gift. Maybe it's time to pick up that pen again? Oh, hey, Mildred, I just stepped out to get some air. Are you joining us or... Jake asked me to bring you these. Looks like the roads are open now. Your car seems to be running just fine. You're free to leave and be on your way, bright and early tomorrow. Thanks. Something the matter? Nice stunt with the keys. Classic, Mildred. Stunt? I was just returning a man his property. Mildred, you have to let things unfold the way they are meant to until we've helped them sort their lives. I am just playing my role, and you know it. Besides, the magic is almost done. Tick tock, tick tock. Will Mildred's meddling ways obstruct the townspeople's quest? Chapter four. - Oh, hi. - Hey. You got your keys back. Yeah, yeah, looks like the detour is cleared up, and my car is okay. So, you're heading out? Actually, I don't know. I was putting some stuff in my trunk, and I suddenly had this overwhelming feeling that I needed to stay. It's hard to explain, but I hope you're okay sharing a bit more of your vacation with me. I can live with that. All right. What's up? Oh, I found this by my door earlier. You didn't leave it there, did you? No. No, I can't claim credit for that one. That's strange. Anyway, I love it and I've been writing all morning. What about? Well, I'm noodling on a holiday story about this village, and its precocious resident tween. Ah, so Izzy is your muse. Well, I'm available to be your first reader, whenever you're ready to share. I might take you up on that. All right. Let me guess, you're responsible for that notebook's appearance? If only I could wave my wand and have them all face their inner demons. You know we can only provide a positive, uplifting experience. Our guests have to figure out their issues on their own. You've practically been all over the world. I have, everywhere but the North Pole. Oh, I'm so envious. You know, I get to travel, too, you know, yeah, when I read. Well, put some of them on your bucket list. You know, I don't actually believe in those. My dad had this whole endless list of places he wanted to see, and he barely made a dent in it. It just broke my heart, but feel free to regale me in more of your adventures. So, where to next? I'm not sure I'm going to do it again this year. Why? You have too many responsibilities as an attending? Not exactly. Uh... anything you want to get off your chest? I hate kale. There, I said it. Okay. Excuse me, Charles? Jake? I'm supposed to play Santa, but I have to set up the grounds for later. Would you be willing to step in and play Santa for me? Ah, I don't think so. Get him to do it. Anderson? He doesn't have the gravitas or the wisdom for it. I don't know what we're talking about, but I think I'm insulted? Since I have you, would you two be willing to play Santa's elves? Uh... hold on, are there costumes? Yes! See, Charles? Everyone wants in. Please, I'm begging you. There's no one else, and the kids are waiting. I'll give you an hour. Merry Christmas. Here to make your wish? I'm... here to fix Santa's beard. Who's in charge here? Where's Jake? What's wrong with my beard? If you're going to do something, you can't do it halfway. You sound a lot like my Bea. She was an all or nothing girl. She sounds like a wise woman. You were lucky to have her. I should, um... get back to the tavern. Okay, who's next? Climb aboard, Izzy. You know, Anderson, if things don't work out for you at the hospital, I see a future for you in elfin arts. Haha. Tell Santa your wish, kiddo. Mr. Santa, this year, I'd like to wish for a bicycle, a dollhouse, a sewing machine, a... Whoa! Slow down, young lady. Mr. Santa, most of all, I want to see my new friend, Charles, smile again. That's a very generous wish. Well, that was shockingly exhausting. Yeah, and actually, I was kind of hoping to sit on Santa's lap, but the kids had dibs on his time. Childhood has its perks. What would you have wished for? Oh, well, there's a first edition of Jane Austen's Emma that I've been coveting. What about you, a new stethoscope or something? No, no, I've got plenty of those. Actually, I like... I like your idea. I think I'm plagiarizing you. Yeah? I've been meaning to read more Jane Austen. Oh! Oh, ho! Hey there. You burst in here like you're running from someone. No, no, I'm just... I'm avoiding a conversation with Diane, to be completely honest. Oh. We need to sit down and have a real conversation, but I just freeze up every time I see her. Hmm. Tell me more. I forgot to call the plumber, which is just a tiny thing, but it's another example of me just freezing up. She treats me like an employee, not a partner. Reminds me of me and Judy. I'm always letting something fall through the cracks. Is it really about the plumber, though? Who knows? Ever since Diane made partner, she's been so stressed with work. I just want to go back to when things were simpler. When was the last time you had a date night that was just about the two of you, not your task-lists? Huh... No idea. We've been so caught up with our frustrations, not our romance. May I suggest taking a time-out from the acrimony? Try to remember why you fell in love to begin with. Yeah. Thanks. I have to admit, this place is pretty magical. Do you have the same events and artisans every year? Pretty much. Most are annual traditions, but some are new, and we escalate, as we get to t
