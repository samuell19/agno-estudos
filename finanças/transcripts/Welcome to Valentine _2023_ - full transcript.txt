You know, I was really hoping studio would inspire me, er but nothing. Zilch. Okay, well, hey. You will get into a groove. I know it. I believe in you, but, um, we really gotta go. So, up and at 'em. Let's go. Oh, please. No. Tonight? I haven't even checked. Whoa. New YHuh? s 40 under 40 event. Young professionals under the age of 40. Opening remarks by honoree Camilla Hollander of the Camilla Hollander Art Gallery. Hollander is the gallery that you've sent all your samples to? Yes. I mean, snail mailed, emailed just all of the mailed, and she has launched the career of so many artists. I need to get some face time with her. Well It's a very good thing that she's gonna be at our event tonight. Hey, what happened with your callback today? Oh, I, um... I booked the role. - What? - Yeah! Oh, oh! Why didn't you tell me that when I walked through the door? I don't know. I'm still getting used to being Detective Elena Bustamente coming to your TVs every Wednesday. Wow. This is incredible. Yeah, my agents are doing back flips and my parents haven't stopped crying tears of joy. It's happening. You know, you just have to soak up the win. Thank you. Uh, I will be quitting cater waiting. So, tonight is gonna be my last show. Oh. How will canapes and I do without you. One tiny little thing is that I, I am moving to Chicago where they're filming, which means I have to give up this apartment. Are you gonna be okay finding somewhere else to stay? Yeah. Yeah. I'll, I'll be good. I feel terrible. You've done so much for me. You took me in when I had nowhere to stay and I've been crashing on your couch for months, so. So, when do we have to be out? By the end of next week. My landlord said that if I leave before the 15th, then he won't charge me for breaking my lease. And I know that you usually go home for Valentine's Day anyway, so. No, no, no. I'm, I'm not going this year. What, what can I do? Let me buy your flights. No, that is beyond generous. You know, everything is sold out and, you know, I was hoping that the prices were gonna drop, but didn't happen. So... Oh, we have to go. Okay. Look, I, I can't be late. I already one write up. Okay. Remember you are Olivia Lafferty, up and coming artist. - Hmm? - Hmm. This is your moment. Oh. You know, and speaking of art, are you gonna make to the conference? I hear it's going to be absolutely incredible. Hey, is everything okay? Yes. Just saying hi. Working an event right now, so I can't really talk. Quick. Mickey, did you wanna say hi to your Aunt Liv? Not yet. I want [indistinct]. No, no, no, no, no, no. I'll, I'll get you some. Just go, go sit down. Okay. I am up to my ears in child wrangling and parade planning and Tyler's away until Valentine's Day. Thank you so much for coming. I really could use the help. Wait, are you flying to Lincoln or? I can't get back to Nebraska this year. Wait, why? I waited too long to book flights and now I can't get to Sioux Falls or even Topeka in time. You know Valentine's Day is only. Five days away. Yeah, I know. I'm sorry. I know how important this is to you. Excuse me. There's no phones on the clock. That's strike two. No. I'm, I'm sorry. I gotta go, I love you. Goodbye. Okay, love you too. You okay? You've never missed the parade before. And of course, this is the first year my sisters the official parade planner. Hey, trays up now. Oh. Yeah There she is. Canape? Canape? Canape? Canape? Canape? Canape? Canape? Canape? - Sorry. - Sorry. Wow. You are out of canapes. I am refilling. Okay, good 'cause I've been in back to backs all day and I'm running on one granola bar. Well, canapes are coming right up, sir. And by the way, we use fresh baguette. Hmm, something to look forward to because this art is not great. Well it's easy to be a critic, it's harder to be an artist. And art is subjective. Right. One person's trash is another person's Monet. Unless you're Marcel Duchamp and the trash is your art. DuChamp. That's a nerdy name drop. What are you cater waiter by night, art historian by day? Um, something like that. Well, you're not from the city. No, I'm from Valentine. Oh, yes. 'Tis the season. Seriously, where are you from? Valentine, Nebraska. Oh. Excuse me. I can't get Camilla alone when she's working the floor and I don't wanna interrupt her. The night is still young. Also, have you talked to the super cute guy? Which guy? Oh, that guy there? Yeah, yeah. A little. Wait, who? I'm talking about dreadlock Denzel. Hold on, who are you talking about? You never think anyone's cute. Oh, oh, that guy. - Him? - Yeah. Wait, that's my cousin. You have a cousin in New York? Georgie Kessler. George now. No, he lives in LA. We are second cousins, three times removed by marriage. Although, actually, they might be the divorced by now. What is he doing here? I haven't seen him in years. Well, you can go and enjoy your family reunion. I am going to queue up pictures to show Camilla my work. You know, I have to, I have to shoot my shot with her. Don't do that. Good luck. Okay. Good evening, Ms. Hollander. Well hello, distant family member. Whoa. Tess. Hey. Wow, so weird seeing you at an event that isn't a wedding or a funeral. What are you doing here? Wait, are you a 40 under 40 honoree? Yes, I am. Oh. Wow. Well, congrats. That's, yeah. That's, that's fun. Is it? I normally don't come to events like these, but I just happen to be in the city. Actually, I flew out to drive my granddad's car back to LA. We're opening up this big expanded office in Venice, Silicon Beach. I have no idea what that is, but it sounds very you. Yeah, I guess it is. Anyways, dad wanted the car at the opening really badly, and I kind of wanted to do a road trip before I took on the new role. New role? CEO. Kessler and Kessler Assets. Oh, yes. CEO. Very important. Yeah, the family line, of course. I'm sorry. Do you have some solid food back there? Okay, all right. Yeah, I got you, fine. You got this. Good evening. Mushroom soup? Oh, no thank you dear. Actually, if I could just have one minute of your time. Hi. It's me again. What is that? Mushroom soup. Mushroom soup without any bread or a cracker even. Oh, this is rough. I will get you some in a minute. Ms. Hollander, I know that your gallery is looking for a new take on still life and I was wondering if you, if you wouldn't mind having a peek at some of these. Maybe some other time. Oh please. It really, really won't take that long. Okay, soup it is. What have you done? I am, I am so sorry Ms. Hollander. I'm deeply sorry. So does this mean you're out of canape's and soup? I'm gonna go get a towel. Sorry. So sorry. I'm so sorry. Strike three. You're fired. How's my girl? Well, she has no job, no career, no apartment, and no chance of ever showcasing with Camilla Hollander. And I still smell like mushroom. It just... I am so sorry about my cousin. He was super rude. And he's the one that knocked over that tray, right? Yeah. He definitely didn't help the situation. He did come up to me after you left and felt really bad, which gave me an idea. I think you need to go back home to Valentine. You should be at that parade. It's lost cause. I can't. I don't have the money. All the flights are sold out anyway. Where there's a will, there's a way. You know, I love you, but willpower alone is not gonna get me back to Valentine. But a car can. What? George has a car. Olivia, this one's yours. And listen, I am sorry for contributing to your job loss and for souring a potential opportunity. I was probably gonna get fired at some point, but you know, you certainly helped speed up the process. I'm useless without sustenance and no self aggrandizing events just make me feel so. Frustrated, overwhelmed. I don't like 'em. They're unsettling. I would way rather be doing the work than standing around applauding myself for it. Eh, debatable. Can I tell you guys my brilliant idea now? Okay, we are all heading west in the next few days. Therefore, we are going to take a road trip together. Hmm? George has a car. So, thank you, George. I'm moving to Chicago, which is halfway in between here and Valentine, Nebraska. I will hop off in Chicago. You can get off in Valentine and you can drive the rest of the way to Los Angeles. You can drive right through that ribbon at the ceremony. Okay, the ending's a bit dramatic, but you are an actor. Well, what do we think of the plan? Hmm? Oh, hang on. This is my agent. Hello? Hey, yes. No, I did, I did send them, I sent them my sizes earlier. Do they need me to resend? Okay, be honest. Did Tess put you up to doing this? Honestly, I'm happy to do it. Your stop is literally on the way. You know, out of sheer curiosity. I mean, you clearly have the means to have your car shipped to LA and fly there yourself. So, I mean, why not just do that instead? My dad doesn't trust the transport companies with precious cargo and I really wanna spend some more time in the car. I've only driven her a few times when I've come up to New York. I mean, how else would you get to the beach? Take the eight to Rockaway. It's a train. It takes you to the beach. Hmm. Okay, fine. I mean, if you really are up for it, then thank you in advance for getting me to Valentine. Valentine, Nebraska. What is it really called? That's the name of the town and it has real people and everything, including the Be Mine in Valentine annual Valentine's Day parade. Okay, your commitment to this is wild. It's a real parade in my real hometown with real people. - Right? - Yeah. And your real Valentine? No, I don't have one of those, but, you know, thank you for reminding me that I'm still single. Feels good. Okay. Bye. Bye, bye, bye. Right. Okay, so are we doing it? Are we in? - In. - Yes! Oh! Oh, I'm so excited you guys. This will be fun. Are you sure that this is cool? I mean... Yeah, yeah. The show offered to put my stuff in storage. We'll just throw your stuff in too. - Okay. - Are you excited for V day? Just going home, it reminds me of how far I still have to go. I've been in New York for two years and wished I'd done so much more with my painting. Now everyone is gonna be asking me the same well-meaning question and I have to give them the same answer. Which is, no, I haven't made it yet. Yet. That is your key word. I've just given this my all. No, but maybe I'm not edgy enough, or concept enough, or you unique enough. You are enough, okay? More than enough. I think all of this hustle and grind has, has stripped away all the fun for you. It's supposed to be fun. Yeah. Fun feels like a foreign concept right now. You'll have fun when you get to Valentine. Yeah. The drive with George part is not gonna be as fun. Noted. Exactly how big is his car? Hey, hey. We heard you, okay? All of Brooklyn heard you. Sorry, Tess wasn't answering my texts. Well, she's not a morning person and neither am I. But we are ready. She will be down in a second. Okay, just because our itineraries locked. Is it now? Well, I didn't know we had an itinerary. Yes, we have destinations to hit by certain times. So, what are you the CEO of this road trip too? You want to be the COO? But more importantly, what do you think about Big Red? The, the car? Her name's Big Red. Oh. Good morning, Big Red. You'll have to excuse me, I'm still recovering from the sound of your horn. Let me get your bag. You pack light. Surprised? I'm an economical man. What's that? - Is this a sketchbook? - It's nothing. Ah, let me see it. The sketches. No, you don't wanna. Okay. Good morning, team. Sorry for the hold up. Yeah, take your time. We're only two minutes behind schedule. You're a morning person, aren't you? All right, let me get. Yeah, let me help you here. Let's go. So, where are we stopping for coffee? Because I feel like a zombie. Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah. Not so fast. Road trip rule number one, there will be no liquids in or within arms reach of the automobile. Okay, okay. You are expecting me to go on this road trip without caffeinated beverages on my person? That is correct. How dare you. Which leads me to rule number two. There will be no food items of any temperature, texture, or density permitted. You know what? I'm gonna get in the car before I change my mind. Yeah. You can take shotgun. I'm gonna nap in the backseat. Woo. You in? Okay. ♪ And I fell for you ♪ ♪ Did you fall for me ♪ ♪ You gave me ♪ ♪ What no one ever gave me before ♪ Olivia, catch. - George. - Tess. Thank you. All right. Break legs. I'll see you at the next family event? Yeah, one of our other distant cousins has gotta be getting married sometime soon. I'll give you two a minute. Be nice. Ah-oh. Uh. So, is this really happening? Because I didn't think about this part. The actually getting the job part. Yes, this is happening and you've earned this. Hey, will you try something for me in Valentine? What's that? I know you're gonna be helping your sister with Mickey and with the parade, but, maybe, find some moments for yourself. Thank you. Okay go, get outta here. - Get outta here. - Okay, I'm going. Get out. Hi, Georgie boy. It's your dad. How's Big Red doing? Can'Love you. see her and you. I got loot. Nice. I'm queuing up a podcast for the last leg of our trip. Please, not another finance one. Okay, I, I still can't believe I listened to the history of the S&P 500. Okay, you can pick the next one. Really? Okay. So, I know you got a rule about eating in your car, but please, please, can I eat these? Otherwise I have to wait until we stop next time. Not a chance. It's, it's Arctic out here. Okay. See, look. I can't even feel my nose. I'm sorry. Rules are rules. Great. Wow. Whoa. Oh, that was just great. That, that's great. Look, it froze. And the time it took for me to walk over here and have this conversation. Okay. Stop, stop, stop. I will warm them up for you, okay? There we go. When do we get to Valentine? - Few more hours. - Oh. So, what's your favorite thing to do in Valentine? Hit the club? Is DJ Cupid spitting some sick beats tonight? There is one bar. It's, it is Pub, actually, but it's on Main Street. Tell me the name. You gotta. It's gotta be on that Valentine brand. - Bow and arrow. - Boom! Yes! Okay. Pretty, pretty good. Well, Valentine's Day is the biggest event of the year. You know, like Christmas is warmup, but Valentine's Day is a marathon. And this is all because the town is named Valentine? Well that's how it started, yeah. But now it's become a really special time of the year. You know, everyone looks forward to it. Well, it's thawing. I can feel that. So, tell me all about this Valentine's Day parade. Okay. Uh. Well everyone dresses up and we make these big parade floats to celebrate love. My favorite part is what my sister and I call "Operation External Illumination." Um. It, it's twinkly lights. They make everything sparkle. That sounds lovely. Yeah. Well, there we go. Thawed out, fully pliable. And you know what? Knock yourself out. What? I, I can eat it in the car? I, I promise I'll be super neat. - I'm... - I will. I'm bending my one rule because licorice doesn't have crumbs. So, don't get too excited. All right, next stop Valentine. It is a real place.

What? Let's jump out for a second. But we're in the middle of the street. Oh, come on, toto. You're not in New York anymore. No cars are coming, I promise. Do you believe me now? All right. Bucket list item checked. But this still could be a fake town installation, but I'll buy it. Okay. - Sorry. - Sorry. - Shall we? - Yeah. Hiya! Hiya, shorty. Hiya. Hiya! Hiya Mickey! Hiya Aunt Liv. Missed you so much. You know how much I missed you? I missed you, missed you so much. Oh, you made it! Oh, my family! Oh my god. Oh, wow. I'm sorry. I'm usually not this crazy. Hiya, I'm Vanessa. It's so nice to meet and welcome to Valentine. Um, hi... ya? Oo. My hiya's kicked in already, didn't they? Mm-mm, hiya is a Valentine-ism. Everyone says it. Once Olivia's within a two mile radius it's out with the hi and in with the hiya. I see. Well, nice to meet you. I'm George. Well, thank you so much for getting Liv here safely. I mean, how kind are you? Did you want a spot of hot cocoa or? He wants nuggets! Okay, Mickey, we do not speak for our guests. You want nuggets. Okay? Well, my goal is to hit Denver by at least midnight, so I gotta hit the road. But I appreciate the offer. Well, what do I owe you for gas? Oh, I definitely ate more than half the snacks. So, we'll call it even. Oh. I put a sticker on George's booty. Okay. Okay, leave him be. Go. Yeah. Sorry. Well, um, maybe I'll see you again sometime. Yeah. - Take care. - Oh. Bye. - Bye. - Bye. Anything else you wanna tell me? I mean, your text said Tess' random cousin was giving you a ride, but that felt like more. Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no. You gotta be kidding me Your car sounds broken, George. Hey, how'd you get outta here so fast? I fit through the doggie door. Should my mom come and help you? No, that's okay, pal. I'd rather not have an audience. Mom! Mom, mom! Mom, mom! Mom! Okay. Well, Ronald's already on his way to help me figure out the finale float. You know, he can help with this too. - Yeah. - I know what's wrong. She just needs a boost. Who's Ronald? Oh, the Valentine mechanic. He's known Liv since they were in Pre-K and he's my husband's best friend, so. - Oh. - Oh, there he is. That was fast. Hiya, lovely ladies. Hiya Ronald. Welcome home. Come here. Aww. So good to see you. Good to see you. But, before we start on any of the parade stuff, this is George. Ah, thanks for coming by. And, uh, George's car won't start. He very kindly drove me to Valentine, but he needs to get back on the road. I'm happy to assist. What's the damage? Battery's a little old, so I just need a set of jumper cables, black on black, red on red. That's it. And then I will be out of everyone's way. Easy peasy, cables I can provide. Thank you. Man, I appreciate it. All right. Cables acquired, like 'em brand new or broken in? I got two sets. Either will do. Thank you. Oh, um. Sorry, can you get the process started? I just gotta take this. Hi, dad. Yeah, yeah, yeah, uh. Everything's fine. We should be right on schedule. What's the story with the suit? You've never brought someone home before. It's not like that, okay? He was, he was just my ride. Okay, sure. Okay, how we doing here? All clipped in. Just hit the ignition and you'll skyrocket outta here. All right, perfect. All right. Whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa. What just happened? What did you do? It's, it's fine chill. No, no, no. I can't just chill. There's smoke coming from the engine. Yeah, I can see that. But I'm, I'm sure everything is okay, right? Yep. Everything's gonna be A-okay. This is totally fixable. What's totally fixable? Look at the battery. The electrical is shot. How did this even, you put black on red, didn't you? You mixed up to the terminals. I didn't. I didn't think I did. I know cars, okay and there's no way this car is starting now because you've completely fried the whole electrical system. - Sir, I... - No, no. Don't, don't, don't sir me. Look, look, it's a tiny mistake. Okay? And don't forget, we're all out here trying to help you, you know. Oh. You're right. Thank you for helping me get stuck in nowhere Nebraska with a fried electrical system. Thank you. Let's go. We have work to do. You know what, I hope you're not stuck in nowhere Nebraska for too much longer. Good luck. It was nice meeting you. What a mess. No, I know. It's just one of those things, I know exactly where everything is. No, no. George snapping like that. What? Oh no. He's just a guy getting worked up over an inanimate object. Wouldn't be the first time that's happened. Yeah, well, he didn't have to say that about Valentine. No, he didn't and he shouldn't have. But you know what I'm gonna say? Love your neighbor. Yeah, well, George doesn't live in Valentine, so he's not my neighbor. Two days, huh? Yep. Final day of prep is tomorrow. Well, do you think your vision is coming together? TBD. I mean, tomorrow really is crunch time. So, I hope you're ready to smock up. Everything's getting loaded into HQ for assembly. And then, most importantly, we begin... Operation external illumination. Oh, I'm so glad you're here. I mean, Miss Hacky has been riding me about the details. Well, it was her parade for 30 years, so, you know, it's hard to relinquish control and pass the torch. I know. I just, you know, I feel all this pressure because, you know, I've dreamt about running the parade my whole life and, you know, I just wanna make it perfect. Well, I am happy to help you out with the parade stuff and lighten the load, but, you know I can't work unless I have... - Coffee? - Yes. Yeah, I know. Let's uh, let's go into town for dinner. Barbara May is dying to see you. Okay, so break it down for me. Realistically, what do I need to get back on the road? At minimum, a new battery, a new alternator. Probably a new timing belt as well. Probably a new fuse panel and new wires to replace the ones that melted. Great. So, an entirely new car. All right. How about you just send me to another body shop and I'll figure something out. First of all, I did this to you. I want to make up for it. Second of all, this is an old car, you're gonna have to send away for parts and that can take a week. Ah, I know. And I gotta be in LA on Valentine's Day, the day after next, with Big Red fully operational. Oh, yeah. That's not happening. Unless... I bet we can piece it back together finding some old parts in my junkyard. Huh? It's not a terrible idea. One of my guys is dropping off some more junkers tomorrow, so, I mean, we can check those out. All right. I'm in. It's our only hope. You know, I don't get to talk to other car guys too much. And I wasn't sure I wanted to talk to you at all though. You were starting to take a tone at Vanessa's. I know. I'm really sorry again. Thank you for giving me another shot. My approach has always been, and my nanny used to say this to me, "Wouldn't you rather have a friend, George?" I mean, yeah. Our town motto is, my pastor always says this, "Love your neighbor." Oh. Hey, so, I'm definitely in the dog house with Olivia, huh? How do I get to their house from here? I've known Olivia Lafferty her whole life. She's definitely not at the house right now. Where is she? Booth ten. At Barbara May's diner on main. She's probably on the second strawberry milkshake. Liv, you can't have milkshake and coffee for dinner. Watch me. Well, look at this city cat. Hiya, sweet girl. Hiya, Barbara May. Oh. How are you? I'm better now I'm seeing you. You know, your, your milkshakes really do heal all wounds. Oh, they sure do. I heard that friend of yours with a fancy red car has some choice words about our little town. Right. I forgot how quickly news spreads around here. All that matters is you made it. Exactly. Yeah. You know and he's long gone by now, so. Good riddance. Okay. You need two straws? Uh, sure. You gotta be kidding me. So. What's happening here, fellas? I invited him. Big Red will be outta commission for a bit longer. What do you mean? How long are we talking here? Excuse me, could I get two beers please? And, you know what, two strawberry milkshakes? Because when in Valentine. Oh, um, I'm sorry about before. Can we go chat somewhere? You know what, George, you're slicker than I thought. I am not trying to be slick. I promise, I really do owe you an apology about earlier. See, Ron and I, we smoothed things over and I was hoping to do the same with you. I was so out of line. But the thing is, is that Ron is a good forgiving person, you know, and you guys have a common interest. Cars. But me on the other hand. Oh, I don't think you'll be so lucky. Hiya, I'm Barbara May. You must be George of the concrete jungle. Yes, Hi. It is so nice to meet you. This is a fantastic spot. Why thank you. He doesn't seem too bad. I think we don't have to give him the boot just yet. Oh, let me guess, this is when you two are gonna tell me to. Love your neighbor. Yeah. Right. Hiya again, George. Wait, can someone explain the linguistic origins of hiya to me? Is it a blend of hi and yea or hi and you? It's just a hi with a little extra love at the end. Oh Fascinating. Oh, Barbara May, my new friend Ron here, says that you have a room upstairs that you rent out. Oh, Ronald is correct. Well, I have to spend the night here in Valentine while I wait for some car parts. So, any chance it's available? The room is available. Yes. Yes. Thank you. Thank you. Wonderful. Olivia Lafferty? Hiya! Hiya Clarann. I mean, wow. How are you? It's so good to see you? What have you been up to? Oh, you know, just have the kids in all different sports this winter, so I am go, go, go. Bet you are. In high school you were like the president of, what, - eight clubs? - I know, right? What a nut. I was basically an unpaid employee back then. And now I'm on the PTA. So, I guess you can say I still am. But look at you. City gal. What is everyone wearing in New York? The trend will hit Valentine in like six months. So, give me the scoop. Oh, honestly I just wear carpenter pants and a smock to the studio every day. Oh, that reminds me, if, if you're not too busy, could I commission a painting? Maybe a flower for Kinsley's nursery? Gosh, you always made such nice pieces. Wow, that, that's really kind of you, um. Is this so silly to ask you? I mean, you're like a famous New York City painter. You must be so busy. I, I wouldn't go that far. Oh, come on. You've been out there for two years now. You must be in all kinds of fancy galleries. She is. You are in galleries. Although, her last gallery opening wasn't big. It was huge. It was an amazing accomplishment. She's the next Norman Rockwell, meets pop art, meets Valentine. She's gonna tell me to shut my trap. But it wasn't any old gallery opening, Olivia here made an amazing impression on one of Tribeca's most prestigious gallery owners. So, only big stuff ahead, right Olivia? Yes. But you know what? The gallery stuff, it really isn't that important. - Oh, yes it is. - Congrats, honey. - Why didn't you tell us? - So amazing. This is why you've been so cagey. - We love you. - Oh my gosh, I'm so proud of you. But you know what's important is I would love to paint something for Kinsley's nursery. Gee, I, I don't know if we can afford you now. Oh, don't worry. I've got a big friends and family discount. - Really? - Yeah. - Aw. Thanks so much. - Of course. Liv, why didn't you tell me about the gallery? I feel like I'm gonna cry. This is amazing. Look at you go. There's a lot of things still in the works for it. So, George, can I talk to you for second. George? Mm, sweet baby cupid. That is, like, the greatest thing I've ever tasted. Oh, Barbara May, can shake your hand for the second time? Ah, you know what, who wants a milkshake on me? Milkshakes, please. Let's give it up for my boy George! George! George! George! George! Okay, okay. Oh, wow. I'm coming back down to Earth after my first milkshake experience. Can you believe that? I am like vibing with this place. Sorry, can we um, can we chat now? No, it's fine. No, seriously, I just wanted to say a few things about... It's okay. You said enough. Look, I'm, I'm gonna go start on operation external illumination down on Main Street. Wait, you sure? Yeah. Okay, well I'm gonna go pick up Mickey from school and finish up some of my list. Yeah. I'll see you back at the house. Oh wait, just give her a beat. The parade is not. Hiya, Miss Hacky. I'm concerned that things aren't on schedule. Should I stop by the barn tomorrow during setup? I do have three decades of experience. Uh, no need, but thank you so much. I've got everything under control. Hey, we're gonna turn the lights on in two minutes. If you don't want to talk still, I could at least come up there and help you. I'm sorry I got carried away in the diner. I'm kind of like a small town celebrity now, so it's a busy full-time job. Hmm and I should ask Barbara May to make you a piece of humble pie. Humility. Oof. No can-do. I'm allergic. You know what, George? You can do whatever you want with your life, but don't pipe up and get involved in mine. I care a lot about this town and the people in it. Understood? Is this about the gallery thing? Because I thought I was helping. At the gas station you told me that you wanted... No, you encouraged Clarann and everyone to believe that I'm some hotshot New York success story and I'm not. So you lied. It wasn't a total lie. You did make an impression on the gallery owner. But you know what? No, it wasn't a lie at all. It was a pre-truth. A what? A pre-truth. Something that will happen, so it will be true. It just hasn't happened yet. Oh, so it's a pre-truth that I'll be a successful solo gallery artist. Yeah right. Well, with that attitude, you definitely won't be. You have never even seen my work. I mean, I could be a, a total hack for all you know. You're not. Fell outta your bag. Found it in Big Red's trunk. Wouldn't I suppose you looked through it. I did. And Olivia, they're outstanding. Why are you being so complimentary? What's your end game? There's no end game. I'm just inspired by the good neighbors of Valentine. That's all. Hmm. And listen, my car's gonna get fixed tomorrow and you'll never see me again. Well, we may have to throw you a farewell parade for you and your milkshake crew. Ha ha. Very funny. Will you hold? Okay. Hey. All right. Yeah. How does it look? Right on. Perfect. The lights are perfect. Wake up. Let's take the show on the road. Oh, it's like dawn o'clock. Oh, the early bird catches the worm. I'm taking Mickey. Meet me at the barn. You can sleep in more if you want. Morning, Barbara May. You're up early. Got lots to do today. Mm. Who did all these? Laura Lafferty. Olivia and Vanessa's mom and my good friend. These are some of the last pieces she did before she passed. Oh, hey. I was just about to call you. So how's it going? It's so fun. I've never played a role like this before. The legal stuff is so serious. So I really need to work on my face because apparently I have resting happy face and they need me to be way more like. Oh, oh. Oh yeah, that's good. But I'm on break right now and I miss you. How are things in Valentine? George must be in LA by now. Uh, surprisingly, George is still in Valentine. What? Really? Why? Technical difficulties with Big Red. Actually, it reminds me, do you have George's dad's address? Hiya Miss Hacky. Isn't it a little nippy to post up outside? I'm just fine. Thank you. But I'm not quite sure things are up to snuff in there. Well, what do you mean? I believe that your sister is committing an egregious violation. A violation of what? Of tradition. Right. She wants to put the finale float on a real car. And that's a problem because? Tradition states that we're not to use anything other than flats on wheels. The townspeople of the first annual Be Mine in Valentine Parade didn't have cars, so neither should we. Interesting. But you do remember last year's finale float got frozen in place on the asphalt. So, so maybe it's okay for things to be modernized a little bit. And trust me, the car that we're using, it's gonna be decorated. It's gonna be beautiful. So, how about that? Well, you take care now. I'm reporting for duty. Hey. Hey, what can I do? Okay, uh, the most urgent line of items in the float department. We've got flats to paint, the top of the puppy love float isn't even close to being finished so someone needs to take care of that. Yeah, I'll handle the floats. You know, consider it taken care of. Whoa, whoa, whoa. You okay? Come here. Please, sit down. Please. Breathe, breathe. Sit down. What. Does everyone think I'm doing a terrible job? No. The pressure is getting to me. You know, I feel like I want this so bad, but Miss Hacky is just itching for me to fail. Which by the way, is not in the spirit of the town. I'm sorry I'm so far away. Oh, no. You're following your gift. I guess the... the root of it is, don't you ever feel like no matter what you do, that there's this feeling that none of it really matters because mom isn't here to see. Sometimes, yeah. Found her box of paints this morning. It's like she's nowhere and everywhere all the time. I'm sorry for dragging you into this sad stuff. You know and thank you. Thank you for letting me vent. You know, soon you'll be back in New York living the high life again. So... Oh, uh. I gotta, I gotta come clean about that. I'm not living the high life in New York. My art is going nowhere. No, you always undersell yourself. Stop. Listen. You know, I've been working as a, a waiter for a catering company to make ends meet. Yeah. Well, for the last event I worked, one woman that could change the course of my career was there and I blew it with her, which got me fired and... Oh yeah, Tess moved to Chicago so now I have, I have nowhere to live. When I'm failing I feel like I'm failing her too. Oh, no. No, no. Stop with that. You are not failing at anything. Okay, you're still trying, which means you officially haven't failed yet. Okay. Yeah, fair enough. I love you. I love you too. I'm so glad you're home. Digging for gold? Um, yeah. Kind of. You? Aluminum for a float. I've gotta finish a high schoolers group project. Oof. Few people definitely had to do that for me in high school. Oh no, you were the lazy kid, weren't you? No, no, no. I was a delegation rock star. I helped everyone play to their strengths and do the part of the project that inspired them the most. Hmm. So, you didn't do any of the actual work then? - Exactly. - Mm-hm. I have a feeling that the parts I'm looking for are not here and time is not on my side. Well, maybe you can find a solution with what's here. I mean, didn't you dream about places like this when you were a kid. Here? No, definitely not. Well, I thought you wanted to be a mechanic. Oh, right. Yeah, yeah. I mean, that's like a kid saying they want to be a dolphin when they grow up. It's just, it's not gonna happen. You mean never gonna happen to a Kessler. Bingo. Hey, hey, slow down. Slow down, slow down, slow down, slow down. You know, it's like when you're picking a paint color, you know, blending one together. You can't rush it. Okay. - Slow down. - Okay. All right. I am, I am slowing down. So, did you always know you wanted to be an artist? Always. My mom was an art teacher. She even sold a few paintings before she got sick. You and your sister have been through a lot. I'm sorry. It's fine. We're battle tested us Lafferty girls. You know what, can you do me a favor? Look out for anything aluminum? It has to go on a float, so it has to be lightweight. Sure. Okay. Humor me. I mean, if you weren't already lined up to be the next CEO, what are you most passionate about? I spend my days thinking about profits and pragmatism. So, passion isn't really on the table. I'm good at what I do. I don't have to like it. Okay. Okay, well put it this way. What lights you up? Because I have to say, you looked pretty impassioned at the diner the other day when you bought everybody milkshakes. That stuff's just fun to do. Well, you should lead with that. How generous you are. Surprised me. You know, when I first started working for my dad, I asked him if we could build out a sister company, a non-for-profit, kind of like a philanthropic impact arm. And? He said, no. Of course. "George, there's no tangible investment return." You could do it now. Yeah, good one. I'm serious. There's a board meeting tomorrow. Perfect. Pitch it to them then. No, no. This is the board meeting where I'm officially appointed CEO. All the investors have approved me. It's my time. You're right. It is your time. Your tiny window of time on this earth. So, how do you wanna spend it? I don't know. I've always let somebody else be the financial advisor when it comes to how I invest my time. I should really slow down more often, huh? Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Check this out. All right. I may actually be able to use these. Hmm. Thank you for making me rummage intentionally. One man's trash, huh? You know, I like that table. I think that could work. - Yeah. - Let me... - Here, I'll help you out. - Yeah. - Um. - Yeah. Ron, is that you? I'm just rewiring now. Any luck on an alternator? Excuse me. Excuse me. May I please use this quiet place to write my Valentine's? You're not Ronald. Hi. Are you still mad about your car? Yeah, you could still say that, but we're making headway. Hiya George. Sorry to do this, but can you do us a huge favor? Uh, yeah, sure. May I please write my Valentine's here? It's way too noisy in the barn. Of, of, of course. Knock yourself out. Woo! Do they need food or water? No thank you. No, Mickey's fine. Just particular about creative space like Aunt Livy. But I'm getting pulled into a million different directions. Are you sure it's okay? - Yeah, of course. - Okay. Thank you. Okay. Nice. I remember Valentine's when I was a kid. What did yours say? Oh, I didn't write my Valentine's. My nanny did. That's silly. Your Valentine's has come from your heart. Are you Aunt Livy's boyfriend? I think you guys like each other. That's uh, no, no. I'm just a friend who's a boy. You don't have to be boyfriend girlfriend to be Valentine's. That's solid intel. Thanks. You're welcome. My dad comes home tomorrow and he's my Valentine 'cause I love him so much. Hey dad, how are you? Good, good. New office is looking great. Everyone is excited for the party. Big Red humming along? Yep, she's humming like a bird. We'll be there. Great. The agenda for tomorrow's board meeting is looking good. Did you see it? I did, yeah. I got the email. You made so many slam dunk deals last quarter. Everyone's eager to get you in. Yeah, yeah. Hey, um, I was thinking, uh, I know I mentioned this a long time ago, but what about starting a charity fund through Kessler and Kessler assets for people who can't afford their first car? We can tie it back to Big Red somehow. And I think it would be really great opportunity. Nice idea for non-profit somewhere. Someone's probably doing something like it already. Hire them. Okay, but what if I did it? What if we did it? Really built out a philanthropic arm. George, focus up. Don't drift on me. Yes sir. Understood. One job, one focus. Crystal clear. Love you Bye. You don't need a car George. Just scoot. Hey sweets. Oh, thank you. Looking good. Tell me something good. Sorry bud. No luck. My guys are gonna stay on the lookout for you, but. But what are the chances they're gonna find a vintage alternator in the next now? Zero. I wish I could have done more. No, no. You've gone above and beyond. Thank you. All right, have a good night. All right man. You too. I've got a part for you. Ah. Everyone in this town is so sneaky. Sorry, what was that? A vintage car part. Whatever you need. This car's got it. Really? And this car is located... Yeah, this is an unfinished wooden float. Thank you so much. No, no. Underneath. There's a car. Oh, just... Ah, look at you knowing the town's secrets. What part do you need? Take your pick. The alternator. Although, if I take it, the car's not gonna run. Oh, don't worry about that. They're not gonna use this float after all. Okay, well, uh, let me go grab my tools and you're sure it's okay? Of course it's okay. Do you really think they're gonna use this junk pile of a wagon for the finale? No parade organizer in her right mind would do that. I guess you're right. Can I give you check, or cash or something? No. No. No payment necessary. That is very sweet. You people really live up to your motto. Love your neighbor. Do I have to brush tonight? It's disgusting. Yes, you do. - Aww. - Mm-hm. You know some people use a tissue, but my mom, your grandma, used to do this. So when you wake up in the morning, you'll see that I left a kiss for you. Very good. Will you stay forever? I'm working on it. Okay, you. You better head to bed, huh? Parade day tomorrow. Big one for all of us. Two strawberry milkshakes. Thank you dear. Hey. So, where's your new border? I haven't seen him since this morning. Can he stay for the parade tomorrow? I don't know. I, I was gonna find out. He's real sweet on you, huh? You think everybody's sweet on me. This feels different. Looks different. Oh really? Well, how so? Because of how you look back at him. Everyone's looking at him 'cause he's a newcomer. But I'm watching you. I saw you under the lights with him last night. He's fun, right? Fine, I will give you that. He is fun. Dating can be fun too. It's a fun part of life. Just a thought. Anyway, his stuff's still upstairs, so he hasn't gone far. Hey. Okay, so where's your bestie? I think he's still working in the shop. All yours. Atta girl. Hello? George? There you are. You know, I, I brought you something. - Thank you. - Mh-hm. You look quite nice. Oh, thanks. You look greasy. Yeah, little bit. So what's the verdict, huh? Will Big Red ride the open road once more or are you stuck in Valentine for another night? Well, I think by George, pun intended, we got it. - She... She's fixed? - Yes. Um, all thanks to a very sweet Miss Hacky? What? You know what? Only you would know how to charm a curmudgeon like Miss Hacky. All right. Moment of truth. Mm-hm. Yes! - She lives. - Woo! Oh, welcome back, baby. All right, well. You still have time for some licorice. Always. Is this your way of asking me to be your Valentine? I dunno. Is it? I don't know. Mickey seems to have a lot to say about the rules of Valentine's. Yeah, well. Mickey has a lot of opinions. I, I'm, I'm sorry. I got sidetracked by the car. How, how, how is the afternoon? The, the, the float stuff. Oh, it was exhausting but yeah, everything is done. And tomorrow, tomorrow's gonna be great. Ah, that's great. I wish I could stay to see it. So, you're, you're leaving tonight then? Yeah, I am. I... I need to. I, I should. Look, Olivia, my life isn't like yours. Okay, I've never made an independent decision for myself or even had the time to figure it out. It's just, it's, it's, it's, it's easier to paint by numbers and that is just the way it needs to be. What are you afraid of, George? I'm afraid of disappointing my dad and being a failed link in my family legacy, okay? Yeah, I can admit that much. I hope you enjoyed your time in Valentine. I over-nighted something to you, um. You know what? That doesn't even matter. That's for you. You'll need it more than I. You can't show up at your office party hungry. You might ruin another cater waiter's evening. - Right. - Yeah. Well, I don't think they have to worry about my blood sugar levels because I've been on a steady diet of Valentine's sweetness. Safe travels George. Happy Valentine's Day. Yes, yes, yes! Yay, Daddy, you're home! ♪ Could you be my Valentine ♪ ♪ I'd be yours and you'd be mine ♪ ♪ The other half I'd have to find ♪ ♪ Would you be my Valentine ♪ ♪ My maybe Valentine ♪ Looks like it, doesn't it? Yeah. I haven't had one of those for a long time. - Really? - Yeah. You know what? Maybe I'll get a, a root beer float. Oh wow. Happy parade day. Where's George? Hit the road. Bad news. George is gone. Good news. I'm a smart cookie and I always figure it out, right? Right. We have a code red situation. All right, Cynthia, I've got a good signal now. Okay, George, I'm putting you through to the conference call now. Please announce yourself and press pound. George Kessler Jr. It won't start. Oh, this is a disaster. An entire fourth grade class and their families are supposed to be on this float. Oh, man. Yeah, they're expecting the float to move. Is there anything you can do? I need a balloon and two hair clips. What? You can't be serious. Okay look, it might work. Worst case, I'll hook it up and tow it. Good morning, Ms. Hacky. Yes, dear. Do you know what happened to the finale float? Absolutely not. Really? Well, maybe if I was still running the parade, this oversight wouldn't have happened. Well, last night George told me that you helped him. So did you help him take something out of the finale float and put it in his own car? Perhaps. But I mean, that is my cousin Hildy's car they're using for that monstrosity. It just happened overhear that he needed a vintage car part. Why are you trying to sabotage this parade? I was pushed from my position. Not by us. You know, the city council voted for Vanessa. She could have not run. You ran unopposed for 30 years and in that time you created magical parades. But now it's somebody else's turn. I suppose it was time for me to step down, but... it's just been a difficult transition. Of course it has. You know what? I have an idea. Oh, Vanessa, I don't think I could be the parade Marshall today. What? Well, how will I find a parade Marshall 30 minutes before it starts. I mean, no one knows the introduction. I could do it, dear. Oh, um. Wow, that would be, that would be great. We'd love to have you involved. Do you remember the... I know exactly where to stand and I'll tell those baton twirlers to watch their range of motions. Okay. How did that happen? Loving our neighbor, that's all. ♪ Truth be told ♪ ♪ You're often on my mind ♪ ♪ Often on my mind ♪ ♪ Give me something that I cannot describe ♪ Four minutes to wake up. Line up please. The towns people assigned to your float will meet you on Main Street. We'll stagger your entrances from here. Copy? Okay. Four minutes. Excuse me. Parade Marshall coming through. Excuse me.

Okay, I, George Kessler Jr., would be honored to accept the role of chief executive officer of this company and continue the tradition of... Your conference call will begin in five minutes George. You were the best Valentine's Day surprise. It's showtime! Puppy love I need you, you're up. Puppy love! Ladies and gentlemen, generations of Kesslers have been great leaders. First, my, my grandfather, then my father. And now it's time for me to step into my destiny, which is not as chief executive officer of this company. Excuse me? George, what is this? Dad, Dad, Dad and fellow board members. Please hear me out. I promise the right thing to do is not to follow a predetermined path for myself, but to follow my heart and give this company a soul.

Valentine, Nebraska. This better not be a Valentine prank. I know this car means a lot to your family and it got me to the place I love most in the world. Here's something to remember Big Red's unplanned pit stop in Valentine. Olivia. Hiya. I thought you were supposed to be in LA. I was, but I spent the night at Barbara May's and I asked her to keep it a secret and she did. And this morning I still didn't know what I was gonna do. I even made it a few miles down the highway. But I just knew I couldn't spend Valentine's Day anywhere but Valentine. Here. Please take it. I had to transport it treacherously in Big Red. I know, I know. Look what you've done to me. I don't know what's next for me, or you or us, but I have to ask Olivia Lafferty, will you be my Valentine? Yes. I my latest find. show you Now this is one of Hollander's exclusive artists. She works out of Tribeca, Los Angeles and her hometown, Valentine, Nebraska.
