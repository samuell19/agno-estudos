How was the flight? People change. Hey! You look great. This is. I'm John. Nice to meet you. How was your flight? It was okay, it was long. What did you do? I read. What'd you read? This book. I'm sorry, I meant to bring you something, a gift, a wedding present. - Oh, that's unnecessary. - That's fine, yeah, really. - We eloped anyway. - Congratulations. Thank you. Shall we get going? John's with the New York Philharmonic. He's one of their youngest soloists. He's a genius. - I wouldn't say that. - What, you are. I live in the endless day of the sun, waiting for the light that never comes. I'll wait for you there. And it will begin again, all over, again, for both of us. In this land of dust and heat, we wait, as each hour passes. We just got married. - Oh, you did? - Congratulations. Thanks, man. We got married two years ago, and we took this place over from my parents. Oh, it's great. So what are your plans? I mean, while you here? Well, we're gonna be here for a couple of days, and then we're going out to Emmond's Pass. That's right. Okay, so I'm gonna give you the Buckskin Suite. That is available. This is for you. I told them to fly her here. I agreed to let her come. Hey, hey, hey, you did the right thing. - Really? - Okay? Don't worry about it. Hey. I got you a room. Thanks. It's right next to ours. You have pretty eyes. Mom's eyes. I left some stuff for you in your room. You should come in, get some sleep. Hey, you could've told me you were getting married. You were unreachable, Isabella. Anyway, we eloped. You should come in and get some rest. What is it? I just remembered, it's her birthday tomorrow. I remember the first time I saw you. You were on stage, playing the violin, and you were like a painting. I remember. And you looked at me, and I wanted to know everything about you. - Hi. - Hey! How you doing? Yeah. Yeah, I'm good, how are you? Great. Thanks for coming. Of course, thanks for having me. You wanna come in? Sure, yeah, this is nice. Are all these yours? Yeah. Thanks for coming, sitting for me. I saw you play the other night, and I thought it was really beautiful. I mean, you must get that all the time. No, not particularly. Do you come to concerts at Julliard often? I have a friend who goes there. I went with her. But I love classical music. That piece you played, the? Serenade? By Schubert, right? I've never heard it played like that before. How is that? Sort of melancholic. And I'm just starting to paint faces, so I thought, hey, he has a pretty face, so. You mainly do, uh? Florals and landscapes. Right, right, right, right. This one's cool. Yeah, it's my sister. What's she do? She's an actress. Oh yeah? You wanna listen to some music? Sure. Hello. You can send her up. How did you know I was in New York? I saw a picture of you online. You were opening a club. I didn't know you still did that. But I knew you always used to stay here. Why are you here? One of your old movies was on television last night. You were like 12, I think. You were so cute. Yeah. Yeah. Hey, I met someone. And he's really, really special. - What's his name? - John. I want you to meet him. Hey. Hey. What is all this? Just things that I've collected and my students have won. Parents wanna dump their kids off here for a week so they could learn how to ride. Oh yeah? Well, looks like you're good at it. Well, I've been here for almost six years now. It seems lonely. It is. There's a reception at the gallery that I work at tonight. I'd love for you to come. You could meet John. Oh, I'll write down the address. You're still painting? Yeah, you'd know that if you... I came here tonight because I wanted to see you. It's pretty much that simple. Because I wanted you to know what's going on in my life, 'cause I haven't seen you in three years, three fucking years! And I said to myself, I said, let her get on with her life, let her do her thing, but, for whatever reason, I can't. I can't do that. I came here today to show you that I care. Please, come tonight. Show me that you do, too. How was your night? I could hear you, last night. ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪ ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪ Wait. ♪ Happy birthday, Isabella ♪ No, no, no, no, no. ♪ Happy birthday ♪ Hey, Isabella. Please come tonight, meet John. - Hey! - Stop, stop! - Louise, stop. - No! Stop! I was just trying to do something nice for her. She makes everything as difficult as possible. She's sick. I just feel bad for her. Why are you defending her? You just met her! - You don't even know her! - I'm not defending, I'm not defending her! Okay? She's completely delusional. This was supposed to be our time. I think it'll be okay. No, you don't know her, okay? At all. European. Robert's come all the way from London. Yeah. And Louise just graduated top of her class in painting. We've got one of her paintings over there, actually. That is sweet. Oh, what are some of your inspirations, sweetheart? I think probably my sister. So what I think, we should keep painting here for a week, see how it goes, and then we might have to get back. Excuse me. - Hi. - Hey. This is great. - Yeah? - Yeah. I don't think Isabella's gonna come. Hey. Hey. I'm sorry for earlier. It's okay. What's that? Something I'm working on. Will you play it for me? I know how important it is to you. Thanks again for the lesson. You're very welcome. You folks enjoy your stay now. Thank you. So how you feeling about marriage? I don't know yet. I feel it's such a thing with our generation, you know? So many fucking apps. We didn't meet on an app. I know, it just not about connection anymore. What do you mean? For us, maybe, but... We're just two people in this crazy world. Everything's just spinning around us. You're so philosophical. Yeah, maybe I'll play for you tonight. So what's your name? Louise. That's a pretty name. Well, what's yours? Andres. What kind of name is that? Louise, I just need you over there. I've gotta go back. Run along. Is this the Haywood Gallery? Sure is. Sorry, sorry to bother you. It's all right. Can I have one? Sure. I was invited to this thing. Thanks. Are you an artist? I am a musician. - Violinist. - Oh. I should've known. How's that? I'm an actor, it's what we do, read people. You know, you actually look kind of familiar. Yeah. - Really? - Yeah. Sure. Can I tell you a secret? I don't really wanna go in there. Do you? I have to. My girlfriend, she's showing. You didn't tell her, did you? About that night at the gallery. Hey. Where were you? I just had to go outside and get some air. She didn't come. I knew this would happen. I don't know why I thought she would. I'm sorry, babe. Hey, I gotta tell you something. I'm so proud of you. I'm sorry she didn't make it. Hey. There's something I wanted to ask you. What made you wanna become a violinist? My mom. Yeah, I was 10, and she took me to this town upstate for the summer. There was this guy I would always see around. He had this crazy hair. I mean, he was completely normal, but I just remember him having this crazy hair. Anyway, he was a violinist in this quartet, and she took me to see them play. They opened with Schubert's Notturno in E Flat Major. And, as soon as this guy started playing, he just transformed, came to life. That's when I knew. Life, I think, is made up of these kinds of moments. Sometimes we don't understand them. Sometimes we do. Isabella. Happy birthday. Okay? I'm sorry, I can't. Louise? You need anything? No. Thanks so much for today. Of course, no worries. Yeah, yeah, well I'll see you soon. I'll see you tomorrow. Yeah, good night. Bye, Louise. Louise, please remember to send the invoices to Mrs. Shrouder. - We need that deposit. - Of course. Oh, and there was an interview with your boyfriend in the Times today. Did you see it? Impressive. Oh, and please stop showing the clients your drawings. They asked. I mean, we showed one of them in the show, Louise, and it didn't sell. Look, I really want to believe in you, but, you know, the market is really competitive these days. It's sad, really, I mean especially for younger artists. But, you know, we just need to focus on the business. I need your full attention, okay? Okay, see you tomorrow. - Did you see this? - What's that? - Oh, God. - "Making his debut "this season, recent Julliard graduate John Harper "is one of the youngest soloists "to perform with the New York Philharmonic. "He describes his musical influences "as Beethoven, Schubert, Leonard Cohen, "with a mix of the prophets." It does not say that. No, it doesn't. How was rehearsal? It was fine. Kind of shit. We've been working on this new piece by this up-and-coming star on the rise. Sort of electric, progressive, the new wave. Right, yeah. Who wrote it? Me. You have got to stop that. You know what they say? You can't be a real violinist til your fingers bleed. Well you're a real violinist to me. Thanks, babe. Hello. Louise Jones? - Yeah, speaking. - Good. I'm calling from Mayhew Recovery Center. Why? Your sister. Is she all right? I can't really disclose that... And she gave you this number? Yes, as her next of kin. Okay. Okay, thank you. Look, we'll contact you - in six months. - Bye. Once her treatment ends. Who was it? It's Isabella. I don't know why I tried to find her, why I tried to see her again. Anyway, they said they'd call again in six months. You okay? Yeah. Did you talk to Mom? Yeah. Yeah, I was surprised she picked up, actually. She asked whether I wore her dress. - Did you? - No. You haven't seen her in, like, forever. I know. He's not what I imagined for you. Violinist. What did you imagine? I don't know. Oh, he's kind, and smart. A genius, actually. We've got something I can't explain. Why did you tell them to fly me here? They called me, you put my name down on the form. I didn't put your name down - on a form. - Yes, you did. I don't know why you keep saying. I didn't put your name down, I didn't do that. There were no forms! - Stop acting like this. - Acting like what? Like you had a choice. Whether you put my name down or not, - you had nowhere to go. - There were so many places - I could've gone. - Where? Your apartment, your apartment in New York. You would've been alone at my apartment. - I'm alone here! - No, you're not! I'm here. I'm here. John! John! And there you are. - Thanks again. - Thank you for staying at the Indian Princess Inn. Take care. - Have a good honeymoon. - Thanks. Hey. Hey. We're gonna be gone for five days. I think it'll be good for us. For all of us. We're in the middle of the fucking wilderness, Louise. I mean, I could've just stayed at the inn. Yeah, you could've. But I can't be alone, right? I'm like a danger to myself. Isn't that what they tell you? You know what? You got in the car. You got in the car and you got on the plane because guess what, Isabella? You need me. After all this time, I'm the only thing you've got left. You're scared. - What? - Yeah. You're scared because you're lost. It's not that easy for me, you know, just to put my life back together. I don't need you to remind me about it. I know. I know. I'm sorry. Do you love him? Of course. Of course I do. It's just that sometimes I think he loves it more than me. What? The violin. He's under so much pressure. I try to understand. I told him not to bring it or he's gonna practice like every day. I don't think he's had the chance to here. I saw him. What? I saw him playing. When? It was at the inn. I was walking and... What are you talking about? Did you play for her? Isabella? When? At the inn. She said you played for her. I didn't play for her. Maybe she saw me. The door was open. I didn't play for her. I mean, it could've been anybody. So it doesn't matter when I'm there? Of course it matters. It's different, though, you're my wife. It's not that deep. I don't wanna get in the water. It kinda defeats the purpose of us walking all this way if you don't get in the water. I don't care, I don't wanna get in. Where were you? John, where were you? Louise, Louise, sorry, wait, wait! - Wait, wait! - No! Louise, stop, stop! Louise! Louise. Louise. - Do something! - I don't know what you want me to do! Okay, okay. Hold this. - Louise. - Don't move her. Louise, wake up. - Can I pick her up? - Don't touch her, don't move her, don't move her. Louise, it's me. Don't fucking touch her! Look, we can't just sit here. We can't do this. - It's too late. - It's too late? Yeah, it's too fucking late. It's too late for what? To get help, I mean, we can't do anything for her. - Look at her. - What are you talking about? What do you mean what am I - talking about? - She's getting worse. - What are you talking about? - One of us needs to go for help. Louise, she was the special kid, you know? She always made people smile. Mom left when we were young. I don't know, I guess two girls was to much for our dad. He didn't really know what to do with us. And, you know, she wanted to swim. We had this big pool in our backyard. One day, I wanted to teach her. I was old enough to know what I was doing. I put her head under water. Her lungs filled with water, and she couldn't breathe. Our dad, he got home just in time, just in time to save her. I don't talk about that a lot. I mean, I think about it. I hadn't talked to her in so long. She contacted me when she... She came to see me. It'd been a while. She told me about you. And it made sense, why she chose you. I understood. Wait. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait! John. What is it, what is it, - what is it? - There's somebody. What is it, what is it? What do you mean, - there's a man? - There's a man. Where, where, where? - He's over there. - Why didn't you bring him? Why didn't you bring him here? Wait! We can go. We can leave. The fuck are you talking about?
