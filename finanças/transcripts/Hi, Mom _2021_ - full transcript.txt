They say a daughter is like a vest to her mother. It's a girl. 2.8 kilograms. But I think I'm more like a fur coat. It's a girl. 4.9 kilograms. I was born different than other babies. Their first word was either daddy or mommy... ...while mine was "more." Kids, you know, always bring trouble to their parents. Mommy. I pooped my pants. But I had some big moments, too. Mommy. I finished first in the race. As I grew up, my mom picked up all sorts of skills. After I started school... ...she often came to get lectured herself. You should help your girl with her study at home. It was till much later that I realize that... ...as it turns out, not every little girl... ...grows up to be beautiful. It's been three years... ...and your daughter's grades have remained stable. That was the first time I spotted white hair on my mom's head. I don't know if you remember what your mom looked like in her youth. I for one seem to remember... ...my mom only as a middle-aged woman. When will you ever make me proud? I'm so happy today. Now I can officially announce that... ...my daughter, Jia Xiaoling, was admitted into a fine college. I've finally made my mom proud. Even my dad was super excited. All it took was a little shenanigan on my part. Fantastic. Of course. I am the best certificate forger in all of Xiangfan. Here, this is your own adult education diploma. Compare the two. You won't be able to tell. The forger guy promised me on his honor that no one could tell the difference. Fantastic. Whose signature is this? Mine. Your handwriting is child-like. Nothing like a dean's. How dean-like is it now? Good. Almost a like doctor's handwriting. Perfect. How many letters of admission do you reckon... ...the Capital Academy of Drama sends out every year? Hundreds... ...if not thousands. And every single one is signed by the dean. To think our daughter will be in such good hands. Exactly. Come here. Huanying. Is this not Wang Qin? I didn't think you'd make it. Well, I have to. Why didn't you say hello to aunt Qin? Your mom and I both resent her. Without Shen Guanglin, her husband, she's nobody. Quit gossiping. She's not really drinking green tea. She's showing off her watch. Just wait and see. She's start bragging even before her butt touches the chair. The atmosphere is great today. Reminds me of the past... ...when everyone was in my house watching TV together. Ling, you wouldn't know but it was so much fun. Speaking of TV, it just occurred to me that... ...your family was the first to own a television among us factory workers. You were so envied. Even me, the director, was jealous of you. We couldn't possibly have stolen your thunder, Director. Remember that volley ball tournament you set up back in the day? That was a huge event and it was truly glorious. Are you complimenting me or yourself? Weren't you the winner that year? How dare she? If your mom and I hadn't missed that game she wouldn't have won. It would've totally been your mother. What would my mom have won? A life-changing opportunity. Come by the supermarket tomorrow and I'll tell you. Now that Ling has gotten into a great school... ...she'd be an actress upon graduation. With the right director... ...plus a little luck, who knows what she'll accomplish? Absolutely. What is your daughter studying in the US? Film directing. At UCLA. What can she do graduating as a director there? Making films. Must be a pain in the ass trying to find a job back home. - She will stay in America. - Wouldn't language be a problem? - She's fluent in English. - Will she make enough money? - Eighty thousand per month. - Where does she even get paid like that? Hollywood. Now... I will set an example for you. Ling... here's another red envelope from Aunt Bao. What are you doing? You should've told us you're gonna do that. Bao Yumei, what do you think you're doing? You already gave us one. Give it back now. - Aunt Bao, I can't take this. - Ying, what is this? It's not for you. It's for the young lady. But you've already given one. Give it back to Aunt Bao. I'm just happy that my god-daughter finally got into college. I'll just put it in your backpack. Aunt Bao, not the bag. What's this for? You already gave us one. Yeah, you did. Mom, give me my bag. What's the matter with you? Mom, give me my bag. Kid, leave it be. We've already received your good will. Just a token of love. Put it in the bag. Mom, give me my bag. Mom, give me my bag. Give it to your husband, Zhang Jiang. As a tree owes its exuberance to rich soil... ...children owe their success to good parenting. This one has no seal. A woman born fragile will grow strong once she becomes a mother. Please welcome the mother of the prodigy, Ms. Li Huanying... ...to the stage! Mom, it's all my fault. I just wanted to make you proud. I know I'm such a big loser. Who says you're a loser? But I'll be somebody someday. I have no doubt. Mom. A fake college diploma for an Adult Education Degree? I was thinking it'd bring in more gift money. I'll tell you what, comrade Li Huanying, you need to start planning now. For what? For what you're gonna buy when your daughter gets rich. How big a ballpark are we talking about here? How about eighty thousand per month, like Shen Tingting. - No way, gotta be more than that. - Ninety thousand then. In that case, you deserve a gold necklace. And this crappy bike of yours, get rid of it. It can barely carry me. Let's get you a car. Cars are smothering. It's got windows. Mom, how do you like that one? I'll turn it into a convertible if you find it smothering. Alrighty then. Uncle Jia. We'll see if she can make it through tonight. Mom... ...please don't leave just yet. I'm about to succeed. If you pass away now... ...I'll blame myself forever. I'm a lousy daughter... ...who has never even made you proud once. How I wish I could change that. During the 80s... ...color film wasn't even available in China. So, the videos and photos we can find... ...are mostly black and white. However... - ...skillful photographers... - Mom. ...would use paint to add a touch of color to those gray pictures. Mom. Mom. - As color photos came along... - Mom. ...those sealed memories... - ...came back to life. - Mom. Well-arranged factory buildings made of red bricks... ...energetic workers in blue uniforms... ...everything seems to be speaking to us about what a wonderful time it was. Young people born in the 1950s and 1960s made up the majority of the workforce in the era. They strode on at a brisk pace... ...with a big smile on their faces. Today, we're going to tour Triumph Chemical Factory... ...for some first-hand experience of a simpler time. Not checkmate yet. Then I'll make this move. Again, checkmate. What's going on? Wait, what is this? I was just talking to Ying and she told me I looked fresh today. I said it must be the red armband. That's when this big girl fell from god knows where... ...and landed on Ying. - Oh no, someone's crashed. - She's not from our factory. Cut the bullshit and hurry. Take them to the hospital. Now, hurry. Make way, people. Come on. That's right. Good job. Yeah. Come on. HI, MOM Am I dreaming? Or did I just time travel? You are in trouble. You're a tough one. Not even a scratch. Did I pass out? I don't think so. You wouldn't have snored if you did. Don't worry, we won't be harsh on you... ...but you can't get away with this. I can see that you're from an average family. But then again, the average family... ...is pretty much average. Just sign this statement that says... ...you take full responsibility for the incident... ...and that it has nothing to do with our safety supervisor... ...who, by the name of Zhang Jiang, played an active role in helping you. - Here, sign it. - Zhang Jiang. - Yep, yours truly. - Uncle Zhang. Yeah, sign it. Uncle Zhang. Uncle Zhang, it's me. What are you doing? I'm telling you, people frown upon this kind of behavior. - What is the matter with you? - Uncle Zhang. I... Ling. How about I'm Ding? What year is this? What? What year is it now? 1981. Year of the Rooster. I wasn't even born yet. How did I wind up in 1981? That character is "xi"? Li Huanying's family. Mom. Mom. Mom. Mom. Mom. Mom. - Mom. - What are you doing here? Let's go. Let's get out of here first, now. Uncle Zhang, this is an odd situation. You don't understand. I'm sure the police will, let's go. Uncle Zhang, please, you always liked me. Who likes you? Come with me now. - Hurry up. - Zhang Jiang. - Mom. - Drop the act. Ying. She's the one that crashed on you. You'd better confess everything, or go talk to the police. I'll confess. I'm from the year 2001. Police it is. I'm your future... Wait, Zhang Jiang. She does look familiar. Do we know each other? Definitely. You are my cousin from the city. Li Leying. It's been forever, cousin. I don't think we've met before. Yet I recognized you at first glance. You look just like my aunt. Do I? What brought you here, Leying? Hang on. I get a question. Stand up. I thought your name was Ling. How come she calls you Leying? Ling is short for Leying. Just say it fast. People usually call me Xiaoling. I got it. So, my name is Zhang Jiang, or Zhang Ji-ang if said slowly. True. Ying. You scared me big time. The whole factory was talking about how you were hit by a meteor. I was worried to death. Got here as soon as I can. I can assure you it's not a meteor. This is my cousin. Let me introduce you. Xiaoling. - Yumei. - Hi, hello. The TVs are here. - TV. - TV. Speed up, girl. Maybe we should take the next one. Then she'll be late. Wang Qin and Ying got the only 2 tickets. And Wang Qin left early. She doesn't own a TV, either? - Nope. - Stand closer. Get on now. I can't. Xiaoling. Try the back. Sure. Come on, people, let's scooch. How did we get off? Ma'am... ...do you know where they sell TV? Over there. - Thanks. - You're welcome. Aunt Qin. Who would know she's gonna get filthy rich? TV. Order, everyone. People who have tickets can go wait in line. Those who don't, step aside. Coming through. Slow down. Tickets only. No tickets, no going in. What a coincidence. I know. We're the only ones with tickets. Yeah, we can both get one. - Are we there yet? - Let me see. Close. Ying. I like your shirt. The blue dots are so cute. - Do I? - Really? It's simple but elegant. Don't let her. Wang Qin, there are more dots on the back. - Not as good as the front. - The backside is better. - And your shoes. - From the factory. - And that dress. - You got one too, remember? Li Huanying. I was actually here first. Then you fell behind waiting in line. What? I was ahead of you. I was half-shoulder ahead of you since the beginning. Then you tried to push your way up, which I ignored. You know? I'm staying right here. I'm staying right here, too. Such a funny girl that she started her own row. Who would serve her anyway? I've never seen something like that before. Do you ever shut up? Li Huanying. You want a piece of me? What, you don't think I can take you? Ladies, please. Watch your manners. Look. There are still ten left. We can all get one. Eight for the city thermo power plant. I'll take one. - One for me. - And one for me. That was close. - Only one left. - Mine. - It's mine. Comrade, I'm here first. - I'm first. A new batch will arrive next week. Maybe one of you can come back next week. Ying. Let's be fair. You stand down this week. And I'll do the same next week. You wish. Comrade, sell it to me. Comrades, how about you both take a step back... ...and leave the TV to someone who needs it more? - I'm in dire need of it. - I need it way more than she does. Comrade... Comrade... ...excuse me, is this where you sell TV? Is it here? Yeah. Great. I'll take one. We only have one left and it's about to be sold. Ah, that's too bad. I've waited so long for this day. When I was six years old I lost my eye sight. How I wish... ...I could feel the colorfulness of the world... ...through this TV set. But... But... Young lady... ...don't be sad. Take this. What is...? This is... A radio. Compared to TV it suits you better. You can hear. I can hear. Now that you put it this way, I'm not sure what to say now. Why are you crying? I'm just thinking... ...thinking about... ...my brother who is deaf. He's not as lucky as I am. You have a deaf brother? And another one who's missing. What an unfortunate family. Comrades... ...may I suggest... ...that we let this poor woman buy the TV. Agree? Well.. I agree. What about you, Wang Qin? I agree. And you? I agree. I can't buy one anyone. Yeah, I agree. Thank you. Ticket, please. Ticket? I need a ticket to buy TV? Will this kind lady let me borrow... ...your ticket? Yeah, Ying. Why don't you give her your ticket? You take the ticket... ...and the money, too. Look what I got. The very first TV in our factory. I got the first one. - Yumei, watch out, careful. - I know. What are you thinking? Are you happy to see me? Of course I am. I can make you even happier. Good for you, girl. People should be positive! I'll tell you guys the truth. That TV Huanying bought even makes me, the director, jealous. Of course. You're not alone on this. Even the manager would be jealous. Come on guys, quiet down. Comrade Huanying is the first one to own a TV... ...in our factory. Yeah. An occasion like this calls for a speech... ...otherwise it'd feel like something's missing. Hear, hear. - I'll say something then. - Great. I'm Ying's cousin... And I helped her buy the TV. Wang Qin... ...it's only been an afternoon, what happened to your mouth? I think, we should all remember that... ...Li Huanying is the first in our factory to get a TV. What? Is it inflammation? What inflammation? It's allergy. We should always talk about this... ...whenever there's a gathering, such as your kids getting into college or married. Yeah! That's all I have to say. Well said, Cousin Huanying. I'll just add a few words to Cousin's speech. The 3rd FIVB Volleyball Women's World Cup. Team China versus Team Japan... ...at the final competition for the champion. And the deciding set is about to kick off. China's turn to serve. Number 10, Chen Yaqiong, is going to serve the ball. Sun Jinfang, nice pass. Number 3, Lang Ping. And she scores. Never knew watching TV is this much fun. China scores with a block. Sixteen fifteen. What more can I do to make my mom happier? Score. Seventeen fifteen. China wins. Guys, quiet, quiet. While everyone's thrilled I'd like to make a speech. To celebrate the victory of team China... ...this year's factory volleyball tournament... ...will be for women only. - Let's show them what we got. - Great! Ying, you got lucky with that TV scheme. I'll see you... ...on the volleyball court. Wang Qin. How serious is this inflammation of yours? There's no inflammation. I have a sore throat because of my allergy. Not that. Your breath stinks. Oops. I thought it was someone's feet. You smelt it, too. It almost killed me. I dare you to touch me again. It's not her game to call. We don't have to go. Right. Let's not indulge her. You done? Let's go. If we hadn't missed that game... ...she wouldn't have won. What would my mom have won? A life-changing opportunity. I will not let mom's big opportunity slip away. Ying, I think you should attend the volleyball tournament this year. Why? Didn't you hear the director? "Let's show them what we got." That's just his catch phrase. Sir, wanna go grab a drink later? Absolutely. Let's show them what we got. Go. See. Just trust me on this one. Something great will happen if you win this year. Ling... ...we've been here for more then ten years. I think we'd know if it'd be something great. Yeah. Ling, you don't come here very often. Let me show you a good time. Just tell me what you want to do. I want to see you play volleyball. Okay, Yumei. Tell the girls to come tomorrow. Have you got no principle at all? Where are the rest of the team? They all have problems to deal with. Did you not make it clear that this time is different? I did make it clear. It couldn't have been more clearer. I even told them that if they don't show up, no one's gonna beg them to come. And that they should never show their faces again. No show. Yumei, my dear, you never fail to impress me. I'll go. Maybe Yumei wasn't convincing enough. If I go myself... ...the girls would at least show me some respect. Can't play. End of the harvest season is days away. I won't be able to make it. Indeed. Yumei told me. But... I came to you myself. What difference does that make? You guys are so funny, taking turns to come. I'm actually quite busy. I went to sleep fine... ...and woke up like this. The first half of the night I couldn't seem to get up. Like I was possessed or something. Then the second half, I finally got up... ...and then my hair was gone. It's OK. It'll grow back in no time. You know what, turn around and let me see. Is it obvious? I wouldn't say so. What do you think? Right. If you don't look closely... If you don't look closely... How can I possibly not look closely? How can I possibly go out again? I don't have time for volleyball now. I'm trying to get the factory to approve this new program. It's called Poems by Yanhua. How I'm under a lot of pressure as an artist. I gave up sport to become a poet. She never even went to school. You have foreigners working here? She's from Inner Mongolia. Her grandfather moved here from the Soviet Union. Let me introduce you. This is Mao Qin. Sister Mao. Don't call me sister. That's for strangers. Just call me Muscovite. Where's my uncle? He's out. He still goes scavenging for junks? He does it as an exercise. Right. Mao Qin. We're here to talk to you about training. I can't do it. I'm starting a business. I'll tell you something. I went to school with this guy, Zhang Kaifen... ...who got super rich selling nothing but tea. If someone like him could make money, why can't I? - Indeed you should make some money. - Right? What business will you start? Something that requires minimum investment or effort... ...but is lucrative. They are not coming. And it has nothing to do with how convincing you are. Yumei, your little speech is not helpful at all. Ling, there's nothing I can do. I don't think we have to play under such circumstance. We really don't have to. I don't get it. Why did you have to do this in the first place? My cousin was making a big deal of it. You guys are not unwilling to play. You're just afraid to lose. Am I right? You hate losing to Wang Qin. But you know what? If you lose this time, you'll probably be losers for life. Reverse psychology... ...doesn't seem to work. This trick, I'm telling you. Who is Jia Xiaoling? Who is Jia Xiaoling? Which one of you? You? You are Jia Xiaoling? - Just as you pointed out. - Boss, say no more. I'm not even finished. We came to you because Wang... What's Wang Shoufeng's sister's name again? Wang Qin. Do you know Wang Qin? Yeah. We're good friends. Why? Did you take her TV? We didn't. - You're a really good liar, you know that? - Let me finish. Boss, I'm upset that you won't let me join the action. Allow me to introduce myself. My name is Leng Te... ...and this factory is my turf. If you are smart enough you'd give the TV back. If you don't that's fine. I'll just deal with it my way. You got five seconds to decide. Five... No, this is a misunderstanding. Four... Three... Two... Boss. - Boss. - Help me. - What are you looking at? Go rescue him. - You go first, I snapped my toe nails. My horse... ...my chariot. My horse. My carriage. How could Wang Qin do this? Sending those thugs to threaten us. We have to attend this tournament and we have to win. That'll crash Wang Qin. Great! - That's what I'm talking about. - Right? But we're short of hands. They are all occupied. We'll help them solve their problems first. How... Ling knows how. Me? How should I know? Where are you going? All yours now. You are such a good friend. I don't want it. What stupid therapy is this? I'm not doing it. What choices do you have? You're not married yet. Mommy, do you think my hair would ever grow back? If it doesn't grow back... ...mom will be here for you for the rest of your life. Mommy... How about now? Can't tell the difference, can you? It works. Not bald anymore. I shouldn't go out and walk him anymore, right? As long as you two are not out together. Exactly. Give me ten more. Here. Ling, this is way more profitable than my dad's scavenging business. Now all that's left are Yawen's rice paddies. Once we're done reaping, we can play some volleyball. There are still a lot. When will we ever finish reaping? Yumei. Where did Ling go? To get help. Said we need more hands on deck. Who else could she get? Then, Chan Ho Nam and Chicken rose to fame overnight in the final combat... ...and the city was the Hung Hing Gang's to rule. That means, all of us are to be known as Goo Wak Chai. Bingo. Right, that Chan Ho Nam you mentioned, what's his other name again? Zheng Yijian. I Can Change? That's one badass name. Boss, you think he's related to our town butcher... ...Aye Don Cheng? Possibly. Boss. We should go to the city and join them. Maybe you can introduce us. No probs. Thank you for sharing all that information. From now on, we're friends. BFF, if you please. Just let us know... ...if you're ever in need and we'll help. Didn't expect you to come to us so soon. You three, get this area covered. Ling. Just reap. Today, Comrade Li Fenjin... ...returned to the factory after a three-year excursion. When seeing his co-workers for the first time in so long. Li burst into tears. Now Comrade Zhao Yanhua from the workshop will perform one of her original poems. "Mr. Li, Crying Is Not A Crime" Yanhua's original poems. Ling wrote it for her. Mr. Li. You can cry, for crying... ...is not a crime. Have a taste of the... ...long overdue tears. Reunited with former co-workers, Lao Liu... ...Lao Zhang... ...and Lao Wei. You should take the chance... ...and let out all your tears. My dear fellow factory workers... ...I've missed you so much! Let me. Good game. That was amazing. Except for Yumei, she's the weak link. She's the worst. But you know what? Someone... ...doesn't think so. Who? Herself. Yumei, come on. We must win. Relax. We will be the winners. Bone fracture. That last move cased it. That last move cased it. You're just helpless. Why did you do that last move? Looks like we're not going to the tournament. Triumph Chemical Factory's... ...very first Women's Volleyball Tournament is about to kick off. Now, let's give a warm round of applause... ...for players of both teams. Ling. Come on. Ying, don't you think your team name is a bit too much? Well, we are the forging workshop. What's wrong with representing ourselves? Ying, Ying. - The manager's here. - Yeah, he is. This is a huge event indeed. So, can we win? Relax. No probs. It gives me great pleasure to announce that... ...our factory manager is here today. Sir, would you do the honor of addressing the audience? Bravo! The game now begins. Bravo. You serve first. Here. Keep moving, girls, come on. Come on! What is it? What happened? Her hair dropped off. No. Hell no. Guixiang. Timeout before the game even starts? Totally unnecessary. Ling, you have really strong hands. I didn't mean to do that. Fortunately, we found out about it now. Any time later and we're done for. Let's just quit. Come on now, we must stay in the game. Ling, it's not that we won't help you. You see, there aren't enough people. - Indeed. - That's true. Okay, that's enough. Ling. Quick, go get Guixiang. - What about them? - I'll talk to them. Coming through. What is this? So, Xiaoling helped you with all your chores and now you're quitting on her? Ling. - Where are you going? - Guixiang left. Everyone else is giving up. I have to find her now. But if you leave now, we'll be even more shorthanded. Then what do we do? We'll go get her. You back and talk to them. - Go. - OK. Hurry up. Don't worry. I'll bring them back. If not, the five of us can play anyway. Where's Guixiang? Yumei went to get her. - Great. - Ling. Now we're one player short and you're the rookie so just stay away from the ball... - ...and don't get in our way, get it? - Right. Come on. How did you convince them? - They always look up to me. - Come on, seriously. I promised to lend them the TV for a week. Come on. Let's kick their asses now. And we'll watch TV together. Alright, let's do this. Ying. Mine. What's the score now? I can't see anything. He's like a mountain. Xiaoling sure is giving it all she got. Totally. Otherwise we'd have scored more points. We're one point away from winning. Pass me the next ball. I know. Comrade Huanying... ...if you feel like you can't go on I can end the game now. I have the power. Referee. Number 13 in. No. God, it's over. Guixiang. What is she doing here? That's OK. It's just a game. If we hadn't missed that game... ...she wouldn't have won. It would've totally been your mother. Use your hands. The Forger Ladies have got some spirit in them. - Are you alright? - I'm fine. Keep playing like this. Come on, girls! We can do it! They act like they've won the game. Li Huanying. If we get one more point, we will win the game. Don't touch the net. Wang Qin. You underestimated us. They don't call me Little Iron Hammer for nothing. It has just gotten interesting! Who's that girl? Li Huanying from factory branch one. Not bad. Have you noticed? People give off a certain radiance... ...when they refuse to give up. Mine. Where do you think you're going? Referee. That one was out of bounds. No way. It landed right on the line. How could it be? I was close enough to see everything. It was out. - OK, I'll be more careful next time. - No, next time won't do. Go explain to the manager now, so we can start over. Now you're just making trouble. How about this? I give you one point, making it even. I'll give you all those three points. I don't want three points. I want you to go talk to the manager. And we'll play for it again. - This game means everything to me. - I'm not a pro, I'm just a cook. They called me at the last minute. Why don't you get off my back? I'm dying of jealousy. In previous years, only the 1st place would receive this. This year, it's like you just have to be here. They're being really generous. This is a nice mug, even comes with a lid. This mug is meaningful. How great is this? Ling, you're so awesome. We'd have agreed to play immediately if you had told us at first. Indeed. I didn't mean that. Now, the manager will present the award to team Forger Ladies. Unbelievable. Just a flashlight for the winning team? I didn't think it's possible, either. But that's what they did. Do you think the factory is generous this year? They truly are. The final champions don't even get promoted... ...or life-changing opportunities? Nothing like that? No.
