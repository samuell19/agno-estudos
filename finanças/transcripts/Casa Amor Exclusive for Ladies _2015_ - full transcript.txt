Just put that away. Honestly, I can't remember the last time I made love to my wife. - You're Late. - Sorry. Why do you play with robots like a little boy? Gotta go, Hayu. Love you! See you, honey. Dad, why does mother keep saying "love you"? Maybe that's what she wants to hear. Don't forget Hayu's Taekwondo class! It's football practice! Honeybuns! You ready to go? - Let's go! - Yeah! - Another new boyfriend. - Guess so. She seems to live alone. Wonder what she does for a living. She's probably a call girl. -Good Morning. - TOY N JOY, take the shortcut, please arrive before my nine o'clock meeting. Also turn off the radio - Yes. - And don't talk to me. Eh! Never mind MARKETING DEPT BACK BO-HEE (Meaning: Hairless Genitalia) Good morning, Let's get to work.

Courbet's "Origin of the World". What is your perspective on the human body? Like Courbet argued Just see it for what it is. As an object of sexual desire? Or perhaps... It's so naughty! Naughty? - Professor! -Yes? Can we go early today? Oh oh oh There's handsome Professor Oral Sex. Spiffy with a stiffy. -Stiffy? -Your boner. You always carry around a big hunk of wood. Always on stand-by. It seems your wife loves you, ah. - Crazy bastard. - Stand by me. Wait up. - I'm gonna die very soon. - What do you mean? - My wife is a sex maniac. - What? Even three times a night isn't enough for her. She saw my nose bleeding, but just kept going. Stop talking bullshit. I'm dead serious. Why else would I be looking into the Russian exchange program? - Why Russia? - They've got the white nights. - White nights? - Yeah. She can't make me do it because it's so bright out. Ahh, I even saw blood on my pee earlier. If they care about the quality of higher education, they should make us work overnight! Nowadays, I wish I were a monk. Nowadays... I fucking have wet dreams. What are you talking? What is it? Where are you going? MARKETING CHIEF BACK BO-HEE Working Overtime. This is BACK Bo-Hee, marketing department. MARKETING DIRECTOR JO JI-HO Working Overtime Me? Give the presentation? The chairman asked for BACK Bo-Hee. She already knew your name. - She knew my name? - That's right. She doesn't even remember the name of the current president. - Oh my god. - She was watching all along. - And she asked for your records. - What for? - For your promotion, of course! - My promotion? Thank you, sir! Thank you! I won't let you down! Of course not. This is very unusual. Oh, let's show "THE JOY STICK" for tomorrow's presentation. Aren't they still working on the samples? I visited the factory and moved up their deadline. How did you manage all that? Tomorrow, We'll put our "JOY STICK" in the foreign investors' hands. They'll see and touch the first-ever organic toy made in Asia! You're the bomb, BACK Bo-Hee! - I'll make the preparations. - Great. TOY N JOY Kim Gi-Cheon Chairman You are now on the road of success It has rolled into the highway of success TOY N JOY Employee Record. If you can't live up to the expectations of the chairman. Everything will be ruined. Your career. Everything, the chairman will make sure of it. It can't be, the chairman is a role model. Honey, I'm home. What's this? He knows about the good news? It's me, honey. Sorry, to surprise you. - A special event? - I thought you'd prefer - Not speaking face-to-face. - That's true. I want to tell you how I feel. I still get butterflies when I think of you. Why are you being so cute? - I still love you like the first time... - Oh stop it! - But we need a break. We need time to consider if... we really belong together. Why? Your life is all about work and your company! I am not coming home for a while! What? - Hi, Madam. - Hi, Sook-Ok. Where's Bo-Hee? Getting ready for work. - On a day like this? - Yes Put this in a vase. Grandma! Daddy's gone. I knew, my cute little puppy. Then my daddy is a dog? What are you saying? Hayu, look what I brought! - I have that. - You do? Told you, I thought I'd seen that dog before. I told you to take your meds. I told you to remind me. That's why I'm telling you now, cutie pie. Stop it, Mom. You too, Mr. Chun. Get yourself ready, Hayu. Come over here. Mom, I can see your underwear. What an obscene things to wear. And it's so obvious too. It's a black G-String?!! Of course, you obviously don't understand anything. At your age, you should not wear a G-string. I am young alright. With this face and body. Not like you, auntie. So, why did Kang-Seong leave? Hayu might hear you! I heard everything! We're just taking a break. - Should I hire a private eye? - What for? Madam, I know a skilled shaman. She can bring him back in three days. - Really? - Just one talisman can make him limp. - Limp? What do you mean? - He'll never get a boner again. Talk about skills. He'd be helpless if he couldn't get it up. Might shove his balls instead. Soon-Ok! Did grandma say anything about me, Hayu? She said you're bald and ugly. She did? But you're still cute. She did? - She said I'm cute? - Yeah But she doesn't even smile when I bring her flowers. Woman just aren't that easy. Fool. This is so cute. Snap out of it. Your marriage is in crisis! That's absurd. We've got a home, car and a steady jobs. Everyone's healthy. We've got everything we could ask for. - Something's missing. -No, there isn't - Yes, there is. - What's missing? - You knew. - What? Sex! Who told you about that? - You did. - What? You mentioned everything you have except for sex. - But that was... - How many times a week? I guess a week isn't even close. Then how many times a month? How many times.... A year? Never. Soon-Ok! Do you ever have sex? Just drop it. Even if you are my mom, please respect my privacy. Foolish girl! Men who don't get it at home will find holes elsewhere! Did you just say "holes"? Ear holes, nose holes, ass hole. - And "the hole"! - So dirty! That's just normal people! What's so abnormal about your husband? You have to pay attention to the needs of normal people! Stop it mom! If he really need it why didn't he say so? Today is a big day for me. My future is on the line. I don't have time for this. Yes? Are the samples completed? Yes, please complete it ahead of the schedule. Dinner is on me once when this presentation is completed. Raspberry tea is good for men. Hey! Who's ass are you staring at? - Make me coffee. - Yes. The package has arrived? BEST CONDITION. Even I would run away from home. Hayu! Your allergy medicine. Stay on top of these things. - You said you'd keep track. - I did not! - You even saved it on your phone. - What are you talking about? Let's go. - Why are you wearing your soccer uniform? - Our semifinal is today. What's a girl playing football for? And you should told me you have a game. - I did. - No, you didn't. - I did - You didn't. I did, Mom! No, you did not. HAYU'S FOOTBALL MATCH TODAY Are we settled now? Mommy thought it was tomorrow it. Score lots of goals today, Hayu! I'm the goalkeeper. Pay me some attention, Mom! My goodness. Babykins! Let's get sushi! Another new boyfriend. - You have a package for me? - Yes, ma'am. Please sign here. Why so upset? - Your hair looks good today. - I think our children need to deal with their own life. That's right, but... We should also deal with our own life. Cutiepie. Isn't that our son Kang-Seong? Who is that blonde girl? Stop the car. - Hey mom. - I saw your husband with a woman. - What? - I said, I saw your husband with another woman. He might be in an affair and doesn't tell you. Are you even sure? I'm really busy today. I have sent you the location, come here quickly. Didn't I tell you I have an important presentation today? I have confirmed the license plate number. 82-8218. Uncle, U-turn! Wait for me here. 82-8218 Even this license plate told you to "Hurry Up". (82 sounds like "Hurry Up" in Korean) She has bigger boobs than you. Hanging like melon. Really big. Mom, you stay here. Quick go, before it's too late Be careful. Excuse me. Ah, you scared me. What are you doing here? My, my friend stays here. I heard she is doing it. - These days, they do it everyday. - Everyday... Can you disturb them? But your friend looks much younger than you Are you really her friend? I just looked a bit older. Oh, so shameful. What is the matter? Excuse me, Reiko-chan. She said she is your friend... SURPRISE REIKO-CHAN! Me, me, Reiko! Me, me. I'll just leave you two. I am sorry, who are you? Seong Kang-Seong? You know Kang-Seong? Ah, Kang-Seong. Yes, here. Wait. Come here. Don't run away! No, Stop! What are you undressing for? Director Jo. The chairman moved the meeting ahead of time. What? Where are you now? Wait. Hey, you're not out of it! I Should I call later. Try to delay the meeting. Bo-Hee, looking forward to your presentation today. Chairman Kim. Oh my God. I will live up to your expectations. This is, no, no, no. I'm busy. So go on ahead. Kang-Seong, you are dead. Concentrate, concentrate, concentrate... How's it going? Did you caught them? I made my decision, Don't worry about me. There is no Japanese girl. Also it's saggy. She snapped. Snapped. What are you doing? Getting hard? Kill it. You are twenty minutes late. The chairman really hates people who are late. Late is also part of the strategy. I am really sorry chairman. I will be responsible for the delay. This delay is part of her strategy. The wait is over, ladies and gentlemen I'm sure you're all as exicted as I certainly am. Times changing Smart consumers today are constantly linked to social media. Terabytes of information exchange all parts of society. But why is it that toys never change? How long must we keep waiting? Children need a new paradigm in the toys of today. And parents only want to give the best to their children. We need a toy that fulfills both of their needs. And we have the solution. The first ever organic toy in Asia. Toy N Joy's innovative new product! JOY STICK. Go ahead, touch them, smell them. And feel them for yourselves! The first ever organic toy in Asia. Go ahead. Touch them and smell them. NO NO NO NO NO NO You call this Asia's first organic toy? No, no... I don't know what... What's the meaning of this? I don't know how... Ms. BACK Bo-Hee! FIRED Hi, Mom. I am at work. I'm doing great. This was my dream job. Oh my... I knew it. I knew it was you! Can I help you? These are yours right? How did you... Those disgusting things ruined my life! Disgusting? Yes! Disgusting! These are my products. I am a sex specialist. Specialist? That's what you call yourself? You're just some call girl. No, I am not. You prefer "call lady" then? Think whatever you like, but I am a shop owner. You mean, a sex shop? Yes. Looks don't deceive. What? You're just obscene! Hey, auntie! What! What! What! How dare you judge me? I'm not the only one. Everyone in the building thinks you're a cheap call girl. That's what you look like! Cheap trash! Don't you ever wonder what they say about you? What are you talking about? A selfish workaholic who neglects her husband and child, whose husband left her because she wouldn't have sex with him. You How would you know if we had sex or not, huh? Did you see it? Who the hell says so? My goodness. I do it! We do it all the time! How often do you peple do it? Did you tell them? Tell who? Nothing. Bo-Hee. I think this is actually a good opportunity for you. Think hard about why he left you. Why should I? Don't avoid your problems. What problem? No husband is that understanding. Understand what? A woman who puts work above her family and her sex life. Why is everyone giving me such a hard time? Is sex that important? Sex doesn't solve everything. It solves a lot of thing between couples. Mom. Love isn't all about sex, sex, sex! Since ancient times, marriage is all about sex, sex, sex! Is that why Dad cheated on you when he was alive? Kang-Seong will come back soon. Don't pick a fight with him when he does. I hope you don't do the same mistake I did. I'm leaving. Who told everybody? The rain has passed over the peaceful meadows of Serengeti. A pair of lions is making love in the warm sun. They continue to make love. They're still making love. You said you just need a break. And you ended up with a Japanese girl?!! Did you do it before you leave? How can you? How can you? Just because I don't have sex with you. You would do it with a Japanese call girl? I want a divorce. And also Don't see your daughter again. We're finished! Voicemail is cancelled. I am not a call girl. I am OH Nan-Hee (Meaning: Masturbation with cucumber) Oh my... Can I call you sis? I do not know your name. We just met. No, we didn't. That's true. Did I get you into some kind of trouble? No, I was just careless. I'm sorry for what I said. It's okay. I don't blame you. And I get it all the time. But what happened to your husband? That idiot? He won't be coming back. Why is a pretty woman like you holding out on her husband? You try being me! I'm too tired for sex after a day at work. It's exhausting. Such a hassle. When was the best sex you two had? The best sex? Can you remember? I can't. Did you ever feel it? Feel what? Orgasm. Of course Who doesn't have orgasm? That explain how it felt. How does it feel? Well... How do I say this... It's like slipping your body into a hot bath. Like "Whoosh"! You don't know, do you? Like a roller coaster. First you get on, then you go up. Up! Up! Up! Up! To the top! All the way up! And it's scary! Then you come down. Orgasm! It's worse than I had expected. Come with me. Where? What is this shady place? My shop. It's nice and... Dark. Let's go. (Korean homonym "Give it to me, quickly.") It must be fate. Who the fuck leaves trash here? Come in. Okay. ADULT TOYS What are you doing? I'm a little... Do not be so modest. Come on in. Whoa, scared me. Dear Customer, Welcome to our adult store. Heh, nice reaction... Not bad. Business is down these days and I'm about to close. Sounds promising. I'm gonna unload them anyway, so take what you like. Take a good look around. You'll find the right one for you. Because it'll choose you. That is, Why would it choose me? Not that one. That's mine. Oh, sorry. How do you stop this? Gosh, I'm dizzy. Is this even possible? You're a little cute. "Lay the rabbit on its back." "Turn the power button hidden under its furry tail." Looks like a suppository. Oh my... Sex should be just between man and woman. Now, I am doing it with a rabbit. What are you doing mom? You're still up, Hayu? What's that? Hello, Hayu! I'm a rabbit from the moon! Dad will be back soon. So, don't worry! I'm not worried. Sleep. I don't want to. Because it is a rabbit? Not just because of that. Do you use that thing? What? The big sculpture that was at the top. Quite often, actually. Really? It's my first lover's penis. What? Like, a real p...? Yes. Oh my... Don't! Stop it! You'll break it. This is yours too... I was here. Why do that. It is. As a memorial. But. Who needs these when you're in love? You were born to do this job. Then trust me. I just can't believe that women actually use these. What if I prove it? Then I'll use them too. Okay, let's go. Where? There she comes! What in the world? She's shocked. Of course she is. There's another one. You better wash your hands. Stop! Let go of that! I can see why dogs like it! Nice shot! You see? Next location. Unless you can wipe with it, it's no use. The results will be the same. Let's wait and see. I'm in front of the restroom. No, it's gone. Again. Let's do it. Not the funeral home, it's the restroom. Toilet You see that? I just can't believe it. How could this be? It's all the same. People trying to be decent in public. But privately, everyone's curious. We both know what will they do with it. To have sex with them. I have proved it to you. Now it's your turn. Okay... I'll do it. A dolphin? Hey, Mr. Rabbit. Are you that good? Want to take me for a ride? You're so naughty! Don't mind if I do. Bang, bang, bang. Absolutely Amazing! Like nothing I've ever felt before. How can I describe an orgasm? You said it was like jumping into hot water. No way. All woman have to experience it. Everyone needs to know what it feels! Now you're an orgasm preacher? I'm not kidding. You have a social responsibility, OH Nan-Hee. You need to help more women realize this happiness! You're doing something amazing here! I'll be closing at the end of this month. - You're really closing? - Yeah. - Yes, sir. Why did you call? - Bo-Hee... I got calls from people at other toy companies. - They said you applied. - I did. They said to tell you that they can't take your application. Why would they tell you that? The chairman is really angry. Words travel fast in our business. You said you're closing this month right? I don't have enough money for the rent. I'll invest. I'll invest for now with my severance pay. Then we'll get a start-up loan. Start-up loan? I'm a marketing expert. Toy N Joy BECK Bee-Hoo decided to help OH Nan-Hee. I'm already getting ideas on how to sell these. Leave it to me. I'll help you gain profit in just one month. We'll become a hit after that. And we'll even participate in a major business fair. - In business fair? - That's right. SEX SHOP? Yeah! I'm serious. The porn industry's strategy is, to disguise sex as taboo and use man's nature to eat the forbidden fruit. They're presenting sex as vulgar in order to make money! But we'll take that negative image everyone has about sex, and completely change it. How? The human body is a part of nature. And nature always inspired Gaudi, the genius architect. So we'll take on his Barcelona theme! The wall of Casa Batllo are our motif. Condom wall. They adorned their walls with tile mosaics like these. It's beautiful. Let me be frank. You don't have any sausages? What? I'm talking about men. What's the hourly rate? I wanted to dress up as an online game character, But people keep saying I look like Steve Jobs. I sensed a kind of innovation when I passed by here. I thought these could be toys for adults. You start tomorrow. No, no, a little bit to the right. That's good. "Casa del Amor"! The house of love. I love it! One, two, three! Our first door-to-door sale! Why are you wearing a mask? I got cold... How can I help you? Can you confirm the items your husband ordered? BUDDHIST TEMPLE Wrong adddress! May Buddha smile down upon you... How outrageous! Why did I suggest this? These are not your average panties. - Introducing... - Eat Panties. They are edible! How brilliant! Taste it. You called them! It has a secondary function. For both front and back. Check it out. What is this? To insert into your asshole. Like an Enema? Look, who's interested? Ugh... You are the one who called them! These are just too good. I can't stop myself. I told you so. Kids would love these. They're not for children. For your husband who loves to drink, There are BBQ flavoured bras. What if he keeps eating these when he should be eating me? We are kind like a virus. Virus? A virus that denies and transforms negativity. We'll create innovative products that aren't vulgar or sinful. It's not like I don't want to. We can't change everything at once. As long as there is determination anything is possible. You're like the Joan of Arc of adult toys. By the way, you really like "Ice cream". - Is Hayu asleep? -Yeah There's flowers delivery. Flowers? With a card from Hayu's father. Throw them away. Don't take it out on the flowers! He can send them to his own funeral. He's dead in my book. I came to Korea for him. What did she say? He said he's still love his wife. Your son is still in love with his wife. Hell yeah! That blond woman didn't do it with your husband Who said that? I saw her crying. It's all just a misunderstanding. He told her that he's still in love with you and would like to return home. So why not welcome him back? All of these is also your fault. Mom, how could you? Why don't you listen to me for once? I'd like to see you this weekend, if you have time. I knew it. How could he ever leave a woman like me? Enjoy your toys. See you. Stop! Stop right there! I said, stop! Stop! Get down here! You scared? I'll be nice. Take a stab at me like they taught you. Why? Did your balls shrink up? My cuffs! Where's my cuffs? Keep still! Ah, it's too tight! Don't move! It's too tight! It's all I have! - Ow! It hurts! - Be quiet! They're too tight! It hurts! Hey said be quiet! Sales are going up. We're gaining popularity. Time to work on our new line. Think we can do it? Let's stop talking about work for once. You are going to meet your runaway husband. We can't even talk now? Sis, you better bring him back with you. Who knows if I'll bring that bastard? Oh, really? Then why you're all dressed up? Whatever the case, it's good to be out in the sun! It sure is! You left that gorgeous man hanging? Crazy woman. Hurry up! Thank you for coming. Thank you for the flowers. You are... Pretty. Do you like it here? It's big. It belongs to my high school friend. He's back from the States after getting divorced. He'll live here now. Filthy rich. Why did you want to meet here? I borrowed it for us for the day. I want to show you something. What's all this? The wine we had on our honeymoon. It was a pretty bad wine. It's still pretty bad. Remember this song? Come on, think. You don't remember? I don't see what all this is for. See that boat over there? My friends had it brought over for his new girlfriend. Remember the boat trip we palnned for when Hayu got older? I don't know. Honey... We spent our youth together and we're growing old together. I want to share every part of my life with you. Honey. I had an orgasm. But we just held hands. No. You've already seeing someone? Are you insane? I just had one by myself. Yourself? It was my first time, but I know what an orgasm really feels like now. Then you've never had one with me? I thought I did, but... Yeah. I didn't. You seem different, honey. How so? I'm not sure. You've gotten incredibly sexy. Really? More than the blonde? Blonde? What did you do past few days in your Apartment? You mean Reiko? I don't know who's Reiko is, she is blonde, young, with big breast. Are you jealous? How could I? Maybe a bit angry but, No, I am not jealous. She's just a whore. She's right here! It's her! Who is the man next to her? It's Kang-Shan. Reiko is Kang-Shan's new girlfriend. Kang-Shan. Kang-Shan is a good friend of mine. The owner of this villa. After I left home, he requested to live in my apartment. Your friend from the States? Correct When did you ever have time to actually find me? I can write a novel with it. So you thought I was cheating, Yet, you still came to see me. Yeah. Wow, I can't believe you can be so forgiving. Could it be that you still really love me? Because I love you, so I came. I'm very touched. I feel the same. Anyway, The thing is, I'm sorry. What the fuck? I can't take it anymore. Brother, go up there and say something! What can I say? Just eat. Fuck! Straight. NICE NICE Shuffle, shuffle. Hayu, look, who's back! Daddy! Hayu! Welcome back! Sorry to make you worry, Mom. I am just glad you came back. Mom, this is grandma's yatch. Hayu is very happy now. Hayu, when summer comes, we can take the boat and travel together. - Really? - Of course. Nan-Hee! Don't think me selfish for working on my marriage, too. I can't enjoy myself with lots of men like you. Lots of men? I know you date a lot. What are you talking about sis? It's been five years since I've slept with a human being. What? Five years? I can't do the real thing anymore. What about all those men? I saw you with them! They are all GAY. Don't assume a sex shop owner just has sex all the time. It's that dildo. That makes you become like this, right? Is he married? Not married yet? Then I'll just grab his collar and pull him over. Can you really do that? Tell me where he is, and I bring him over. We broke up. We bid our farewell. I think I am also terrible at love. Sorry, Nan-Hee. Anyway, did you tell your husband about the shop? - Not yet. - Why not? He won't mind. We're trying to be more open-minded. I'll tell him soon. Don't worry. You're clamping really tight tonight. That's right. Ah, it's so great! Really? Again. How is it? Quickly. Ah, good. - Was it good? - Yeah - Did you come? -Yeah But I want to go again... You think you can? You're hard already? I'm always on standby. I'm spiffy with a stiffy. Stiffy? It's all yours, baby. Do whatever you want. Stretching your lower body will help you reach orgasm. Tightening your muscles will also help. Honey, let's try using my leg again. Like this? Scratch my vaginal wall. Scratch? That's it. Keep going. Is this right? Honey, follow the rhythm. Like this? That's it. Stretch out your body. Like this? It went in. Oh, this is... Oh, here. Let's go even faster. How do you like it? Great. How about you? I felt sort of dominated when you pulled back my wrists, and I felt twice as much pleasure when you hit my vaginal wall. How about you? Me too. It feels good when you hold me tight. Be more specific. Specific like... Let's do it again. No, no, let's just talk. When you stimulate me inside. It's the best... How good is it? Tell me? You are too beautiful Let's try again. Keep going, keep going. Honey, I'm dying. No, no, stand up. Keep it hard. It's sunrise. Was it good for you too, baby? Many things keep women from reaching orgasm during sex. They usually fail to relax and effectively control their muscles. Hey, Professor Oral Sex. Things looking up as usual? Today ... What happened? Where is the wood? Why aren't you stiff? What happened to you? You should be hard! Wait up! What are you doing? Today is "Hotel Day". Hotel Day? She needs to do it outside every two weeks. New surroundings, new sensations. New characters! I wonder if she'll mask me again. You seems at peace now. I have to live somehow. My wife wants to eat out too. Are you sick? You looks really pale, just like a corpse. Really? What's wrong? I'm just a bit tired. Su-Bum, Any news on that Russian exchange program? Nothing yet. Why? Just wondering. Hey, your nose. It's bleeding. Geez... Is it that bad? You too... Huh? Goddamn it. - Bend over. - Huh? Hold it in. Don't plug it. I'll have a mochaccino. What about you? I guess it's not a cafe. Look, they sell toys! Adult toys! Strawberry condom. Does it smell? And what's that? Let's see! A mochi? I heard sex shops like these make over fifty thousand a month. Maybe I should open one. I used to make toys, after all. And these are just toys for adults. Good evening. - Give me some spritzer. - Pardon? Give me a bottle of that sexy spray stuff. You mean anesthetic spray? Yeah, that's it. It's not very effective. What are you talking about? Quit your shit. Whether you use the spray or not. I can't tell if there is any effect. Let us just go somewhere else. What a lousy shop. Maybe the wine is getting to me, but this place is sort of exciting. I'm getting a bit excited. How about you? Let's go. We should report them. Honey! Honey! Wait! This isn't that kind of shop! Honey! Why don't you let me know earlier. They are just trying to make ends meet. Why go that far? Maybe they have their reason. Maybe their children is sick. Then shouldn't they do the right thing. You heard what they say. So this is what you sell. I came to pay for these. They're on the house. We returned those because they were too small. They are not small. He just has fat wrists. It fits me fine. He really made such a fuss, so... Gosh. You don't have to buy anything. But I should at least buy something. It's okay. You can just go. Oh, it's raining again. Wait a moment. I didn't recognize yout out of uniform. Even my friends don't sometimes. I feel like I lose my identity when I'm in uniform. I become just another cop. Like what I do somehow defines my existence. "What I do defines my existence"? My name is PYO Kyung-Su. (Meaning: Circumcision). - I'm... - Don't let the name fool you. Because I'm a B.C. kind of man and proud of it. "B.C."? "Born circumcised." Sorry, I'm really terrible with jokes. Anyway, you looked better in uniform. I do? Thank you. This shop is impressive. But, who needs these when you're in love? Who needs these when you're in love? I spoke out of turn. We do what we do to make a living. Apologies. Don't you like supper? No, I like it. I apologize again for the defective product. We'll send you a new pair of "Pinocchio Panties" right away. What are you doing? Testing a new product. New product? They call it the "Dancing Thong". This part vibrates to music. "Dancing Thong"? Perfect for warming up your body during foreplay. I like it. You should test it too. Should I? You shouldn't wear it over your panties. I'm not wearing any. My goodness, woman. It's cumbersome. You're too adventurous these days. Huh? I don't feel anything. Your husband! Yes, honey? Honey, I don't think I can make it today. Make it where? Hayu's game. Her final match is today. How many times did I remind you? I didn't forget. I'm on my way out. I'll call you later. Where are you going? Hayu! Go get them, Hayu! Uncle, hurry up. Why didn't you pick yo your phone? I was stuck in traffic. Victory! Victory! V-I-C-T-O-R-Y! Victory! Victory! V-I-C-T-O-R-Y! Victory for Eden School! YEAH! Victory! Victory! V-I-C-T-O-R-Y! Victory! Victory! V-I-C-T-O-R-Y! Ah ah YEAH YEAH YEAH! Stop! A worthy opponent! Let's begin our cheer! Cue the music! Hey, I thought you lost your mind today. Trust me, I was about to. She's stuck to you like a glue, even though they lost. She's happy her mom came. Mom! Turn it off! What the hell... Soon-Ok! Snap out of it, Soon-Ok! She's not dead, is she? Open your eyes! Honey! What's going on? Kang-Seong. Yes? They're not mine... Doctors said you shouldn't speak. Stay with Hayu, honey. I'll take care of her. Hurry! To the hospital! Be careful, honey! Dad this... Goodness! What are you doing, honey? Soon-Ok will be fine. She was slightly electrocuted, but she'll be out in a week. Hayu found this. Oh my... I guess Soon-Ok was quite lonely. I don't want her to come here anymore. I should have the alumni list here. I'll call back after I send the e-mail. What's this? What the... CATEGORY OF BUSINESS: ADULT TOY SHOP. We'll just embarrass ourselves at the business fair. I'm going to protest outside if they don't let us in. Go and tell your husband the truth first. I will. I mean it. When the time is right. He must have reported us. - Sit still, I'll take care of it. - Huh? Good Afternoon. Sis I'll handle it. I am the owner of Casa del Amor. Let's go. What? Huh? What's so funny? This is why, honey! I felt twice as much pleasure when you hit my vaginal wall. Scratch my vaginal wall. I had an orgasm. Good Afternoon. It's packed here. I can't believe it. A tree of condoms? How ingenious! Mom. What are you doing here? What about you? I'm here to shop, of course. Oh my... You heard about this shop too? Mom, I... My goodness. Doing everything you can to tighten your grip on your husband? That's not it. Did you see their goods? They're fabulous. The owner is a sex expert. Their products are so clever. Mom, can you just go? This is very awkward. Who are you, telling me to leave? I am the co-owner of this shop. No, She's the owner... You're a real piece of work. But why is this awkward for you? How am I suppose to explain this duck vibrator to my mother? You don't need to explain. I have used it with your dad. Say no more! Stop! Stop! This is image in my head. - This is so wrong! - But we did try them all. Welcome What's going on today? What to do? There. Just tell him. I can't. Not now. Scoot over, scoot over. What do we do? Mom, please get him out of here! You'll have to pay me. Damn it! Hurry up! Hurry! I'm sorry. I'll pick it up. Look, who's here? And in a place like this. What are you doing here, mom? I asked first. I'm just... Looking to buy something? No, I'm just passing... Mom, what are you doing here? Me? Hoping to save some lost souls. I didn't know you had a fetish. No, you're mistaken. I won't tell Bo-Hee. What am I thinking? I'm sure you both enjoy it. I'm off! Hurry! Please don't tell Bo-Hee you met me here. You'll have to pay me. I need to talk to you about something. But I can't find the words... I know You know? Yeah. I wanted to tell you... You've got it all wrong. You must have all sorts of strange ideas. But those aren't the facts. Facts? There's a reason why I went to that shop. I thought they should pay for Soon-Ok's medical bills. But your mother... Anyway, it's not what you think! I don't need any sex toys, do I? When you don't trust me... It really hurts. You don't mind what I do for a living? There's nothing wrong with doing honest work. I've seen lots of crazy people with decent jobs. When I look at the people we arrested, lots of them go to good schools and big corporations. But you're a kind, caring, and beautiful woman. What more could a man ask for? I'm sorry. I just can't. It's okay, Nan-Hee. Are you ok? I'm sorry. I haven't been with a human being for a long time. I hope it's not because you don't like me. I like you. Very, very much. Very, very much. Well, then that's it. That's all I need. You're just not used to people, I guess. Hold on. Why don't we try something? Come on, baby. Let's drink Mommy's milk I went back home when my mother passed away. My dad and brother kicked me out. What? Word spread through town that I was running a sex shop in Seoul. I guess they were embarrassed. So you haven't seen them since? Yeah. He said he'd disown me. I wonder if he did. Even if he did, It doesn't change who you are. Sis, I'm a little scared... I should be in love with a human being, right? I have to tell you something. You finally slept with someone? With Kyung-Su? Congratulations! You think I can get married and happily raise kids like you? You'll be much more happier than me! But I'm scared. Don't be. Just be good to him! You'd better be good to him! Understand? It really hurts... Our business fair has forty years of tradition. We're not some back alley street market for sex toys. Even if times are changing, this is too much. Our board members agree. We mush revoke their application. We should file a police report for slander and public lewdness! I understand, but... But what? We should send those vulgar trash to prison! I allowed them to participate. Of course we should allow them! She had an unfortunate fall on her way to the top. I'd like to see her rise again. She ruined my reputation. I wanted to see her complete collapse. Thank you, sis. It's all thanks to you. Why are you so emotional today? I can't stop crying. We're so quick. That's good. We should think like innocent children to create fresh new products. Banana? Lacks creativity. Eggplant? Deliberately hardcore. Cucumber Hey, OH Nan-Hee. Anyone can come up with that. Vegetable don't work too well. Right. Mom. Can I sleep with you? Kang-Seong too. How about this? Good. Supper! Who can get undressed first? Punishment! punishment! Open up. Let's try again. You're finally telling him today? I'll come out of the closet with this invitation. Hi Honey, I was just about to call you. Can you come home early today? I was going to. What's happening? I have something for you. Realy? Because I... Never mind. I'll be home early. I love you. We're all set? You bet. I'll see myself out. Ms. BECK! The customer called again about her Pinnochio panties. I'll stop by on the way. You will? Tomorrow's the big day. Let's blow them away tomorrow! Pinocchio's nose gets longer when he lies. If only my husband could lie as well as him. He's just too honest. I see... Have some tea. Thank you. If you look here... Put it like this. Then pull this side. It is completely broken. How do you take it off? I told you it's faulty. Honey? You're awake already, dear. Your husband is home? Do we have company? No! Just a solicitor! We're not interested! Just go away! Go away! Sheesh... I'm going crazy. Honey! I'm coming! What should I do? Where are... You came back early. I was surprised you remembered today. What now? Of course I remembered! What are you up to? Getting ready to shower! You're not going to invite me? I'll be right out! But I want to come in. I'll be right out! I'm coming in! No! Wait, wait! The door's locked. But now it's open! What? You're not taking a shower? You're taking a bath! You impatient man. Honey, give me your hand. Why? Just give it here. Come on. Honey! I can explain! Honey! Honey! I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Sorry. Honey. I can explain everything! Just hear me out! It's not what you think! No, honey! No! Stop! Don't imagine things! Don't! Stop imagining! Honey! Honey! Honey! Honey! Honey... Drink slowly. You should eat something. Open up. It seems you don't like sausages. What's the matter? Su-Bum... Yeah? I have this friend... And? He has a wife. And then? She uses tools... She's a technician? No, not that... I mean, during sex. And? How is he supposed to understand that? It's weird. How should he understand that his wife uses sex toys? That's the problem? Yes. If your wife doing well? Yeah. Whoever your friend is, he is a bit old fashioned. You think so? Some people say, "Toys just add to the fun." I wasn't going to say this because it's so embarrassing... My wife asked to put on her underwear. The whole package. Don't picture it. Did that help? So, your wife is doing well? Your damn friend is worrying for no good reason.
