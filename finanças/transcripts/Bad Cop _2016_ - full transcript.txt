You forget the discipline? You want to quit? - King (zh: 皇上, py: Huángshàng, en: Emperor, Play with his name) - Be serious. Uncle, you saw what is was yesterday. If I had not shot the killer, the whole RCU (Regional Crime Unit) would have ended up dying. It makes sense, and I have no idea of how to refute you. Certainly. Does that mean that I should reward you? I don't care. Hey you, I'm not talking about the sniping. Tell me, why did you tear up your skirt and make a warm up in the transaction? Uncle, you know I like skirt least, so. - So - Stop cottoning up. Hand over your work card. Uncle, are you serious? Be quick. Uncle, my dad will not be happy in the heaven. If you die, your dad would be really unhappy. Uncle... And. Back. What else do you want? This girl is named Tang Fei. She was almost raped by a bully in her school and the only heir to the first consortium of money politics - the Familiy of The only heir of Rongjing. Miyazaki Rongjing. Luckily, their math teacher Wu Xie ran accross the crime. At present, Miyazaki Rongjing is prosecuted. Wu Xie is an eye witness and will appear in the court three months later. - Help, help. - Come on, come on. So who are these two girls? Both of them are students from their school as well, but they have been missing for two months. We believe that the two cases are greatly related to each other. So you, with others, are assigned by the superior to be an undercover female student in the school. You should secretly protect the eyewitness Wu Xie, and find out the whereabouts of the missing girls. You must be kidding me, undercover again. If it goes on, I will be another Tony Leung. It's not bad to be the best actor. Come on, I am female. Then the movie queen! Please tell me why it's me every time? I figure that's because you are pretty. I'm afraid I can't say no to that. But there's one condition, I will not be dressed in skirt. I will not forgive you. Ah, Why do you... Hey Kid, how dare you peep at me at such an age? Watch your eye! Which may be blinded! I'm not peeping at you. It's just that your legs are too long, stepping on my feet. Oh, what a pretty story you make! As you praise my long legs, do you think I would forgive you? Look. Sister, would you please move away your legs? Excuse me, sorry! So sorry! I'm so sorry. Sorry, sorry, I'll go to school now, and you should go too! Hurry! Go. Bye bye! Be careful! - Yeah, | - Yeah,... - I said it would work! Well, today's spicy bars are on me! Let's go! Excuse me, do you know where is Mr. Wu's office? Sorry, I don't know. Jiminy! Excuse me, have you met Mr.Wu? Sorry, I don't know. Please powder less. Timing and Subtitles brought to you by The Bad Cops Team @ Viki Wu Xie Mr. Wu, we know that you joined the school not long. It is believed that you are going to make better performance in the future. You leave a good impression on our Boss, who wants to make friends with you. Here's a bank card. Which can overdraft freely. Our boss expects you to keep silent about what you have seen, and offer the young man a chance for correcting his mistake. Please convey my gratitude for the kindness of your boss. I'm just a teacher. that gets used to a simple life. It is hard for me to tackle something complicated. Wu Xie is unexpectedly upright. In fact, our boss demands nothing but expects you to be absent for the court at that day. President Long cares about his son and I fully understand that. However, I have to be responsible for my students. As for what kind of opportunity will offer for a young man to correct his mistake, I believe the judge will offer the most appropriate answer, Mr. Wu, you've read lots of books, so you'd better be clear, that a man's choice will decide his destiny. My destiny as I start working in the school, has been set. Mr. Wu, thanks for your valuable time. Take care. Wish that we have another chance to meet each other. You are welcome. I have lessons to give, so see you. Come out! Mr. Wu, thank you, sorry about the inconvenience. Don't worry. Everyone should be responsible for his behavior. You should believe that the judiciary is just. Mr. Wu, happy birthday. What is this? Don't be stupid next time. Thank you. I will hold it in mind. Go back for lessons. Yes. Wu Xie is not common. How could I approach him? You are Yang yang. How do you know my name? Just now, I saw your data and photo concerning your transfer to the school in the Principal's office. Nice to meet you. My name is Moli. Nice to meet you, too. What are you doing here? I...I have a abdomen ache. Are you alright? Fine, I feel better. You've not visited our classroom, haven't you? Ah, yes. - Let's go. I'll take you there. - Here we are. Which class are you in? The same as you. I am a new student of it, too. - Here. - Here? Yes. Go ahead. Ok. Mr. Wu, are you Ok? Class begins. Next, let's talk about section and domain, the focus. Everyone, please remember. Inline program exactly maximizes by the above two differences. Positive fraction is in equivalent match while negative fraction is in vacancy. All the real numbers link the above two numbers. The two real numbers which are called ends of a section. This it is how a section is defined. Stop! Don't take another step. Excuse me, anything wrong with you? I... In the future for my class you don't have to come to my class next time. Very well. No, Sir, it's a missunderstanding. Just now, I saw you sleeping and I thought you'd better not be bothered. And now, since you wake up... Yes. Then stand there. Sir, I didn't mean to sleep, in fact... actually, Sir, she does not feel well today, stomach ache. You know? Yes, yes, yes, stomach ache. Or how about asking her to go to the bathroom in my company? Go ahead Thank you, Sir. Go on. Aiyoo... You help me, you fix me. You realy have a way. It's not that I have a way. In fact, the fact is that I could not take in anything any more. Since I was a child, I have been not rather interested in triangle, rectangle, or something like that. If it had not been my family that asked me to finish my study, I should have pursued my dream already. Dream? What are you up for? Policewoman(It's the '{female} Cop' from the movie title.) - Policewoman? - Right, I feel they are particularly powerful, like heroines. That's just your imagination,they are not as unrestrained as you imagine. - Yes? - You 're right, they are not as unrestrained as I imagine. I have a cousin, a policewoman. She is rather dog-tired every day. Besides, she has to undergone all kinds of restrictions. Her work is very dangerous. She is not free. You'd better quit. Oh, I feel we could make good friends. Later when I become a policewoman, I will definitely protect you. It's not easy to be a policewoman. Of course I know. So it is called a dream. Tell you what, I'm not girly. I have learnt some kung fu. Kung fu? Right, let me show you. How about it ? Good, this way, you will not be missing easily. Oh, hey, you've heard that? Of course, is it public in the school? That's ok, later when I become policewoman, I will definitely protect you. What's up? Fine, let's go downstairs. Mr. Wu. Hello, Sir. You guys, have you been to the bathroom, haven't you? Is there a bathroom on the balcony? Sir, we were in the woman's bathroom just now. I failed to see you in woman's bathroom. You are surely a damn snitch. Come here, I promise I will beat you to death. You intend to beat your classmates as soon as you come to the school. Later, will you beat your teachers? I heat snitch best in my life. such an open snitch. But i've never met Enough, you two stand here for one hour. Do not leave, If I failed to see you in one hour when I come back, you won't take my class in the future. See, what a powerfull teacher you are! You scare me. What a surprise. Surprise? Miyazaki Rongjing Mr. Wu, long time no see, do you miss me? You are out on bail. What a genuine teacher you are. You excel others in your knowledge. No wonder your guess is correct You are in bail at present. So please treasure your transient freedom and campus life. Oh, I wonder Mr. Wu, all teachers expect their students to do well. Why do you always expect me to do bad things? I'm not qualified enough to teach a student like you. Mr. Wu, in the next term, we will meet each other? My answer will be no. I have the same answer. Ouch! I've never met someone ill-bred like you in my life. Oh, Ah, see who's here? Open your eyes, arrogant terminator. I'm your Grandma Yang. Grandma what? Grandma Yang? You need a spanking. Interesting, when I come back to campus, there is a Grandma. Oh, I'm not lonely any more. I feel I'm going back to the peak of my life. You are really ill-bred, I think. Really How dare you do that? Grandma, take your time, I'm busy today. Ha, I'll play with you. Ha, see you tomorrow. See you tomorrow. No See you every day. - Bye, bye. - Stay What does this mean? You two continue to stand. Is there anythings wrong with you? I'm trying to help you. You should make us stand! You're not better than him, whether you stand or not. - You'd better figure out. - You King (zh: 皇上, py: Huángshàng, en: Emperor, Play with his name Huang.), I wonder if I could quit. Honey, it's not that I don't want to help you but there's nothing I could do for you. Oh, please, Mr. Huang the old man, you have no idea how upright Wu Xie is. I'm curious about which scriptwriter sets the role. We all live in a film, as an actress, forget your complaint. Just play your role. It's impossible! I always break away from the story as soon as I see him And that Miyazaki Rongjing, what the hell is that? 123, I tell you, you'd better keep a close watch on the eyewitness 24 hours a day till it's court's time. Understand? Could you just give me some incentive? - Drink a bottle of Mizone (= Red Bull). - Is there a JDB (herbal drink)? - Only the Arctic. - Are you sure that we are in the same tempo? - Fully consistent! - Come on give me something practical. One of our informants offers some information. In recent days, Japanese that is wanted sneaks across the border, I suspect that Family of Rongjing will take some actions recently, so you'd better watch out there. Just a teacher, why bother? Will it be better to kill him in a car accident? Sorry, Good Luck is not my story. Good Luck. You have a way - Be careful. - Get. as soon as the film is completed.The scripwriter will go to hell. Hey are you kidding me? Timing and Subtitles brought to you by The Bad Cops Team @ Viki You are all well, let me take you for a shower. Wait me for a moment. - Have a shower. - Thanks. Don't catch a cold. Here. I tell you, you'd better not come in. If you dare come in, I will make you blind. Are you always boring in your life? Teaching is boring, isn't it? Do you have a girlfriend? No, someone so boring like you will not have a girlfriend. What's your constellation? Right, you must be virgo. Only virgos are abnormal. Do you fall in love with someone? you court death. I bring clothes for you. Stop watching, I tell you, you are a teacher Right, why do you have women's clothes in your house? Is it frequent that you bring girls back home? It's just your imagination. It's my syster's clothes. - You have a sister. - Yes. How old is she? Is she pretty as me? Nearly the same age as you. Is she at home now? She has gone. Sorry. Sorry, I didn't mean to. Never mind. Oh, my God, I'm dressed in clothes of a dead person, of my God! She's studying in UK. You teachers always fool others in talk. It's not me that fools you, it's scriptwriter. Ah. Could you please play your role, ok? In fact, other than you are unruly. You look like my sister. How much alike? She is just like you, quite lively. She liked being around me since she was a little girl. And her first word since her birth is brother. You seem to love her very much. Of course, I treat her as my little princess. I will not let anyone tease her. She is my only family. It took me surprise because you are so boring, that you should love someone that much. You are my student. If you can study hard, I would love you as my little sister. Study hard. Stop kidding me. Actually, you can do this. You just haven't found funny in learning. Thanks for your reminding. I will study hard. Hungry? There are food in the refrigerator, take whatever you want. Nice. Are you ok? You cook as you are fighting. I'm OK. This is my style for cooking. - What are you... - It was just a warm-up. I'm cooking noodles. Just in a minute. Be careful. Sir. Go! Hurry up! Sir. Sir. How could you be that careless? Fortunately, there's just 0.000000001cm to go. Or it will be so over. How was I supposed to know the man in black pretended to faint What's our principle to treat bad guys? To deprive him of all action abilities. So you do know this! GOOD! (Gut!) But is that what you did? Not so good. Not so good? just for quite a little difference.You should know it will end quite differently. Sir. Go! Hurry up! Sir! You are lucky that God would like to give you another chance. Do not make such stupid mistake the next time. Take it. Yes? Continue your job. Sorry. Sorry, I did not expect that things would get that bad. I hope you can forgive me after you wake up. In fact, It is said that Mr.Wu got hurt to protect you. So, please stay away from him from now on. You are a person who can only cause trouble to others. You know that? You almost destroyed the man I love the most. Ah? What's going on? I've got no idea. Take your flowers and stay away from him! Tang Fei! Enough! Yo, yo, yo, Grandma Yang, how could you be here? Where is Mr. Wu? Is he all right? I worried about him so much. Will Mr.Wu run into any danger again? Will he have such good luck as in this time in the future? In the future, is there any good luck that? We shall not... We shall never see him later? I promise you, he will absolutely live longer than you. See you, everyday!
