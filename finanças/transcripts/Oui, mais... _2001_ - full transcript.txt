After creating the universe, the Gods wondered where to hide the truth. On the highest mountain? In the deepest sea? On the hidden side of the moon? Finally they said... "Let's hide it in the heart of the men." "They will look for it but will never understand it's inside them." Old Indian Tale Yes, but... Good, you are here. I was lonely. Was the place easy to find? Please come in. By the way, I'm Erwann Moenner. I'll show you the way. Watch your step. This is my cabinet. Here, all kinds of people tell me their lives. And learn to be authentic. He's cheating on me. He told me yesterday, while we were watching: "What is love?" Sometimes they replay their lives. Say it again and I'll break your face! He said: "Calm down, I didn't say a thing about your mother." They are epic fights to get better and evolve. He's a devil. And a slap never killed anybody. It's for his own good, isn't it? I like three things about my work. The first and most important one is to help people solve their problems. See someone go from problem to solution is a real happiness. The second motivating thing is... is to understand how one can get stuck in a relationship that torments him. Also, therapy is Shakespearean. There are crisis, cliffhangers, euphoria... I can't help but think: "This is a novel". A play, a movie... Today, I'll like to share that with you. Tell you an adventure. What about your math test? Great. - I got an A. - A? Good. Very good. It was worth studying during the week-end. Here. Take 200 Fr. - You can buy a dress. - I'll see. Thank you. A disc, a ticket, whatever you like. I've been expensive recently. You deserve it. Eglantine. No, sucker, that's us. That's how... Look, Eglantine, I bought this for you in London. Wow! It's so cool! - You told me you collect them. - It's very nice of you, Sébastien. See you later. Sébastien. - Can I invite you to the theater? - Theater? Sure! Let's meet after the Linear lesson. - Okay, see you later. - Okay. Do you feel lonely, my little Seb? You shouldn't have dumped Isabelle so soon. She's after me, Youssef. What would you do? Isn't she hot? I see... a young man. 19. Good-looking. Kind and intelligent. I see... he is standing up. Now he's sitting down. He's near a beautiful girl. He's going to... - Are you available tonight? - Yes. Let's go to the restaurant. Or come back to the theater, the film looked great. Or go to my place. I'd like to talk to you. Actually... Actually I can't tonight. Really? I'd rather not, I... - I have something planned. - It's okay. - Tomorrow then? - I can't. - What's the matter? - Nothing. Tell me. Listen... I just need time. Time and stuff. No problem. I'm Mister Sweet. Mister Sweet is in a rush. Here we are. You win with a ten. Congratulations, Mireille. I always said Mireille could play the dead. You must be skilled to play the dead. Is that you, sweetheart? - Hello. - Hello, Eglantine. "Mister Sweet" called. He said he is available everyday. How's that Mister? Your English teacher? A friend. - Is everything alright? - Mom, I'm not 12 anymore. But I'm still your mother. What's this? His phone number? If you call him I'll make the scene of the century! I'm glad my mother gives me advices. Did you notice? When you chat... it's always the same screenplay, it begins... and ends the same way. My profession calls that a game. You may have noticed that Denise Laville, Eglantine's mother, loves to play. With Mireille, for instance, her bridge partner. She plays two different games. The first one, obviously, is the bridge, and a game of power that consists in belittling Mireille. Th second one is a psychological, unconscious game. Mrs Laville is like us. We all like playing. Not only inoffensive games like cards. There are unconscious games in most of the couples and families. Mr and Mrs Lenoir, for example. Who took my toothbrush again? Who can it be? This dialog between Mr and Mrs Lenoir is called a game. Of course this does not seem fun. But their fights help time to fly. They are framed by strict rules. Sometimes the game is conscious. Sometimes it's unconscious. Who took my toothbrush again? Probably the Pope. The main difference between classic and psychological games... is that one makes the players suffer. Psychological games are numerous and diverse. But we all have a favorite one. Mr Chanteau, for example. You're lucky you can go to the theater. With Adelaïde... - You have no babysitter? - Good babysitters are hard to find. I know a good one. Thanks, but it's too expensive. - Give the baby to your parents. - I wish I could. - But they can't. - They can come to your place when he's asleep. Yes, that's true. Yes, but... it would annoy them. You can still ask them. I know the answer already. If you don't want to go to the theater... I told you it's not easy! You're a pain. Mr Chanteau exposes a problem. He pretends he's looking for a solution. But as soon as he has one, he can only denigrate it. My profession gives a name to psychological games. Yes, but... it would annoy them. "Yes, but it's not easy", "Yes but you forget that...", "Yes but I'm not sure"... "Yes but" is one of the most played games. Is it true your father lives there? I love London. Englishmen... But I can't really speak. I'll see the House Guards. *I know a great theater in London with comfortable seats. - When will I see you again? - Tomorrow night? Tomorrow night? Wait. Wait for what? Tomorrow night Hey, hey, Your Majesty! Tomorrow night Tomorrow night... Tomorrow night... Tomorrow night. Sébastien? Douglas? You're going out with Sébastien Douglas? This can't be true, Eglantine. It is true. Is it forbidden to go out with Sébastien Douglas? How could it be when he slept with all the girls of the class? These are rumors. Jealous girls talk a lot. Do you know why he did his senior year thrice? I don't care. He loves me. It's all that matters. That's what you said about Jérôme. It's different. That's time he's the good one. Okay? The good one. You chose you game partner when you need him. Even if that need is a unfavorable one. It's true for Eglantine and Françoise. One plays "Look how beautiful I am". The other one "It won't last long". It's true for Mrs Laville's favorite game: "without you". Mrs Laville managed to marry a man that earns enough money for two persons. She is a housewife. He owns a company and works 70 hours a week. Good evening. Did you take to car to the garage? I had no time. Did you have time to play bridge? The Master is in 15 days. The impenetrability of valves are most important than your Master. - I'm already under-ranked. - The professional circuit, again. - I have money. - It's not about money. - Without you I'd be a ranked player. - Sure. You'd better thank make for saving you from a terrible disillusion. You think Mrs Laville never heard that sentence. But... The Laville started playing a year after their marriage. They have been playing for 19 years now. 19 years than Mrs Laville makes the same complaints and hear the same reproaches. It over-strains and sadden her. She is not happy. But nobody forced her to marry that man. Unconsciously, she didn't chose him randomly. When they met, she felt he corresponded to her clichés about men. A cliché she got from her mother: men mistreat women. Don't trust them. You'll see, they are all the same. All the same. Mrs Laville has a group of friends that share the same clichés. You know what he answered? "Just go back to your mother." You know what he added? Bring my clothes. Maybe she will find the time. They are all the same. All the same! When you suffer, it's hard to accept you're responsible for your suffering. You unconsciously found a miserable equilibrium with your partners. Imagine... What happen when your partner stops playing? Good evening, Sweetheart. I have some big news for you. Let me do it. Robert Lacoin told me the regional team needs a good player. I gave your name. - Is it a joke? - Not at all! We have enough money to employ a housewife. I can even pay for bridge training if you want. You waited 20 years to tell me this? You think I'm at your disposal. Imagine someone takes your right to complain, fight or criticize. Your right not to change. What a disaster! Nobody can force me to be free! I don't want to! Don't you eat? Who are you going out with? Sébastien. Mr Sweet. - Do you know him well. - Be assured I know him well, Mom. What time will you be back? I don't know. We'll see. - Leave her alone. Can't she go out? - Of course she can. What are you doing tonight? Is there dessert? Isn't Dad here? Mom! You can go, I can handle myself. Seb, it's me. I have a problem, I must cancel. I'll explain. Aren't you mad? I know, me too. But... We'll talk tomorrow, okay? Kiss. Are you happy? I didn't ask you anything, Eglantine. I'm fucking fed up! - You're home already? - I didn't go. - Really? Why? - Guess. Can't you take care of her? I tried so many times, Eglantine... If you find a solution... In psychological games, like in tragedies and fairy tales, the main characters are the sames: victims, persecutor and saviors. The victim is the one lose something, who is in awkward situations, who complains. But the victim can't do that alone. There must be a partner, the persecutor. The persecutor criticizes, is evil but better than the others. Victims and persecutors get along very well. But sometimes the victims looks for the savior's interest. The savior helps the others. He thinks they need his intervention. They couldn't go on without him. What happened last night? - Hold me in your arms? - Is something wrong? - Do you love me? - Sure. You told me you'd explain. - My mother had an accident. - Really. What kind of accident? An accident of... - I mean... She fell... - She fell in the stairs? - Is she at the hospital? - Yes, it's quite serious. So how do you explain she answered the phone this morning? - You talked to my mom? - Yes, she sounded very healthy. - She knows how to hide things. - And what to you hide? Why? - Is it your business? - When we have a rendez-vous, yes. Sébastien, please, don't get mad. Do you know what your mother said? That you wanted to stay home. The bitch! Fuck! It can't be true. Sébastien, don't believe her lies! - I wanted to see you! - Really? - Sébastien, trust me. - After you told me she had an accident? Listen, I... Where is Mr Sweet? Mr Sweet doesn't like lies. No, Sébastien, not now. I can't speak now, I'll explain. That's fuss. And Mr Sweet is pissed of by fuss. The pork. He left already. What? How are you? Did you see Sébastien? Yes, I saw Sébastien. He hugged me, told me he loves me. None of your business. Close the door. I just wondered. Why the hell do we play painful games? We play to obtain the gratitude we need. Either the game his agreeable or not. Games have something comfortable. Yes, they prevent you from being happy. But they also protect you from anguish, madness and suicide. That's why they last... and last... and last. I can't believe it! Who took my denture again? But sometimes one says: "It's enough!" My little daughter. Mr Moenner? I'm calling because... my mother has a problem. Yes, of course. When? The day after tomorrow. Eglantine Laville. Yes. 27, rue Pierre Hiver. 6th floor. Okay, see you on Friday. Thank you. Hello, Miss Laville. Come in. I'm Erwann Moenner. Was the place easy to find? I'll show you the way. Watch your step. Have a seat. What if you had gone out? She would have been drunk. And? I would have felt guilty. You didn't go and still feel guilty. You mean I should have gone? I mean situation would have made you unsatisfied. - Are you an only child? - I have a big brother. He left the house so he doesn't have to deal with my parents. Do you think it was a good solution? I don't know. - Is your mother a drunkard? - No! I mean she doesn't drink 3 bottles of wine a day. She drinks when she is sad. This is a secret. Can you cure depression? I don't give medicines. But sometimes I help people get better, yes. I'd like you to take care of her. Miss, I can't do anything for your mother. Why? Because she is not here. I don't think she would come here. I'm sorry. So she will keep being a pain to me? Do you want us to work on your problem? - I have no problem. - You like people being a pain? How are things at school? Fine, my father is happy. Your health? My liver aches sometimes. Any fights? Is this is grilling? Yes. Sometimes I feel lame. However... It's nothing compared to my mother's problem! I'm sorry, my balance to compare people's problems is not working. Do you know the difference between difficulty and problem? Your grand-father dies at the age of 75. You're sad. You mourn him. It's painful, but... It's normal, it's life. It's a difficulty. But if you can't get along with your grand-father, you have a problem. That's great! She will keep drinking and I'm make efforts to get better? Oh, you want to get better? I'm not ill. Do you need to be ill to get better? - Excuse me? - Do you need to be ill to get better? I got it. Someone who goes to a psychiatrist needs a doctor. I didn't come for a therapy. My mother is ill! - How old are you? - 17. - Guess how many of my patients are teens? - No. None, Miss. None. People wait to divorce and have problems with their kids to come here. I'm sorry to get mad. But it's my savior's face. I want things to change. I think you can change at any age: 50, 60... - Make a therapy at 17 is wonderful. - Why? Because at this age you haven't made the big choices: your work, your partner... A successful therapy at the age of 17 saves you from problems and sadness. - You're selling yourself. - I believe in what I do. Did you make a therapy when you were 17? I started at the age of 32. I waited for the sufferings to be stronger than me. You decide. I have many clients and you need to get involved for it to work. I'm fed up with grown-ups telling me what to do. Don't bother, I'll find the way. How are you? Fine, I just I want to commit suicide. - Do you remember Elodie Marchant? - You friend from last year. - Her mother went to see a psychiatrist. - Really? When you see her, she doesn't look like she needs one. When people are crazy it's not written on their face. - I didn't mean she is crazy. - So why go to a psychiatrist? Don't you think so? No. Maybe she was very ill. I don't think you need to be ill to get better. What's with Mrs Marchant and her psychiatrist? Nothing. Wait. Are you suggesting I should do a psychoanalysis? - Not at all. - I hope so. It would be delirious. Sometimes I feel depressed, but... And you drink too much too. Who's fault is it? He should do a psychoanalysis. He's the crazy one in the family. Seb, did you mean what you told me? - What? - That I make fuss. - No, you don't. - But I don't like when we fight. I don't like that either. I swear. - It's not I asked for, Sébastien. - Really? You snuggle me, I have desires. It's natural. Are you the kind who sleeps with her boyfriend and holds his hand? - You don't understand. - I know, I'm not very smart. Wait, I'll become well-educated. So... Fusillade... Fusion... Fuss! Persons that lacks simplicity. Here. You lack simplicity and natural. I hold you, I have a hard on. It's normal, it's life. Fusser, persons that likes fusses, starches. See chippy. Do you prefer chippy or fusser? As long as he doesn't try the cigar trick... Fuck you! When boys look under your skirt you're not that funny. You're right. They are all obsessed. Excepting Nicolas! But what did you expect from Sébastien? You don't have to make love. - I do. - You do? I want to make love, not just fuck. Yes, it's better. - But I wonder if... - Do you know what he told me? "I hate when we fight." "I swear." - I believe you. - No, that's what he told me. Thank you. See you on Thursday. Eglantine! I went too far. The dictionary thing was awful. I don't like when we fight. I hate that. I swear. I suppose you're happy to see me again. You won. I want you to win. Take responsibilities for your actions and the consequences. Well... I don't know if I have a difficulty or a problem. And... I don't know if it's my my mother or my boyfriend. Maybe the two are linked. Suppose a miracle happen one night. A fairy appears near your bed and gives you one wish. What would be the proof, the next day, that a miracle occurred? My mothers stops drinking and my father cares for her. No, no. The fairy came to your room, not your parents'. - I send her to them. - Of course. It'd be nice if people were robots we'd guide them with a remote control. No, what would change in your life. I don't know. Maybe you have an idea. Maybe... you start drinking. Or you slap your father everyday during breakfast. What? Or maybe, you mother get depressed... or drunk, and you do nothing. I'll repeat. You don't need to react when your mother has a problem. That's selfish. No reaction does not mean no compassion. What if selfishness was taking other persons' responsibilities? Can you repeat? A walker looks at a butterflies going out of its chrysalis. He listens to his heart and decides to help it. He takes the chrysalis carefully, opens it and the butterfly goes. Nice, isn't it? But... Deprived of the efforts he had to do, the butterfly is not strong enough. It's eaten alive. You mean we shouldn't help each other? - Help, yes. Save, no. - It's inhuman. Playing the savior and stealing responsibilities definitely is human. And... what about Sébastien? Working on your relationship with your parents will help you with Sébastien. So, what do we do? Let me suggest you a short therapy. 10 sessions. - 10 sessions? - Approximately. Maybe more, maybe less. I thought a psychoanalysis took something like... years. We're not doing a psychoanalysis but a short therapy. I'm too impatient and chatty to do a psychoanalysis. Your thing is better? If you fell in a septic tank, what do you do? Precisely, you go out of the shit. You take a shower, try to understand why you fell. - Then you read books about shit. - If I fell in a septic tank, it's recent. I was told problems have faraway roots. I see many people with faraway problems that keep falling in shit. I know some that dig, fill and dive in the tank and pretend they were forced in. Sometimes I feel like nobody can hep me. - Are you ticklish? - Yes. Here, maybe? No! You're talented, your body remembers the ticklish areas. Now, try to do it yourself. It's like your problems. You can try for years and have no result. In 2 minutes, somebody else can do it. And, what about the price? Each sessions lasts 45 minutes and costs 300 Fr. But, the pricing for the holders of a Junior Pass is 170. It's better. I'll need very good grades. Yes? Why is that? My father gives me money when I have good grades. - Is it expensive? - What do you mean? Our actions engenders consequences. Good or bad. A therapy is a way to herself. Don't break it. A in philosophy? Impressive. I never was good at philosophy. What's the coefficient by the way? Eglantine. Coeff. 7. - I hope it makes you happy. - Yes, thank you. - Do you know why people do a therapy? - With a psy you mean? - Why do you ask? - No reason. - I heard a girl just started one. - Who? My cousin's friend. She seems to enjoy it. I understand why she needs it. If you knew her parents... Why not. If nobody is forcing her. And as long as she's hot! I'm kidding! Does she tell you to stay home? Does she tie you to the radiator? If you hadn't seen your mother, would you have gone with Sébastien? Did it ever happen? You alone with a boy, like it was planned that day. Do I ask you questions? You want us to talk about me? My role is not to force my way into your intimacy. I know it's not easy. I'm bored of thinking! You're here on your chair, playing Mr I-know-it-all, I-have-no-default. Yes, I'm afraid. I'm afraid of leaving the house. Are you satisfied? It's good you avoid the subject and talk about me. You know why? Don't impatient to forget your problems, they actually protect you. Of course they are hard to endure. You cant escape your sufferings easily. A protection is expensive. - What am I supposed to say? - How good you know you are. The respectable person you are, the real Eglantine. What is your first goal? I don't know. Maybe you have to tell me. Stop biting the hooks people throw at you. Which scene, which behavior, do you think would prove you reached that goal? The ideal would be she let me meet Sébastien without all that fuss. A remote control to change people! Let's imagine... One evening, your mother is not well. Still, you go and meet your friend. You can do it. Is this our goal? Yeah. Can you say it to me? - I'll try not to... - No! Trying is so radical! You should attempt to try. Perhaps. When I feel ready. I'll go and meet Sébastien, even if Mom is not well. Françoise, how was your first time? You made up your mind? Is it serious with Seb? Please... Good decision, it's great to make it. The first time, I was so afraid of his dick I ran away. You ran away naked? Don't be a pain. I was only 14. I had no brother. Sorry. Then what? Then I tried with a cousin. He was a virgin too. We couldn't do it. And... you real first time? Real first time? With Manuel. During the holidays. I didn't understand what he was saying. He didn't either. But it was so good being hold by him. What did it do yo you? What were the sensations? Well, it... - It fills the space. - It fills the space? It's it disgusting? No. It's agreeable. It's sweet. But it depends on your partner. Does it last long? I wasn't looking at my watch. At the beginning, wasn't it painful? Not at all. If it's made with love it doesn't hurt. Yeah, maybe. - I don't want us to have secrets. - Yeah, fine. - Let's tell our secrets, everything. - I tell you everything. - I started a therapy. - What do you mean a therapy? - I'll tell you later. - No! A psychoanalysis, right? - No, a short therapy. - Isn't it the same? Seb, what is a psychoanalysis? Mind your own business. Eglantine, is your psy handsome? - Watch out Seb, rivalry! - You're so dumb! - What's the matter? - Because... because it may be dangerous. A therapy, dangerous? How would you know? I just know. Some therapists are charlatans. Their approach is similar to gurus and hawkers. It may become a drug you can't live without. Maybe, but why is it your business? I'm the one at risk, aren't I? Are you afraid I become a drug addict in a sect? Maybe. Do you really know your therapist? How is he? He is... Very cute. Around thirty. Some gurus are cute. They are the most dangerous. It's you I'm addicted to, Sébastien. Yeah... See you later. - Seb! - What? Thank you. Guru A. Very good, keep it up. - How's your psychoanalysis? - Fine. - What about the money? - I found a way. I'll end up being a cashier for a fast-food restaurant. - How funny! - Is Seb still faithful? You're damn funny today! Laville. D. What happened? A moment of confusion? No, I'm alright. D? What happened? I don't know. A moment of confusion. - With two assholes making fun of me? - They make fun of everybody. But me above all. Especially when you're here. "Eglantine, can I use your funnel?" Did they use it? I thought you were more open-minded. Open-minded? My mother went through a therapy. She wasn't crazy, okay? But it make her dump my father. The rest was bullshit, provocations. Well... - I don't want to see the assholes again. - They are my best friends! Don't make me choose. Are all your therapies like this? Only the most serious ones. You accumulated pain for years. Now, you let it out. It's normal you feel it. Why do I feel so bad? Tell me! What's the reason? I have convictions but not all the answers. Otherwise I'd do another job. The answers are inside you. Do you want to find them now? When your father criticize your mother, you defend her? Is that abnormal too? Imagine... - You don't defend yourself. - I should let people step on me? No, but you're not an interrupter switching form ON to OFF. - They are different behaviors. - Which ones? Irony, for example. Humor. You want me to laugh when people give me a hard time? I may have an efficient solution for you, but... - No. - What? I'm not sure you can do it. It's... delicate. What? What's this trick? If you insist... When someone makes fun of you, say the worst thing about yourself. Do you have a worst plan? Imagine you have a huge nose. Someone makes fun of you, what do you do? You can cry. Or slap your interlocutor. Insult or kill him. You can cut out your nose, or go for surgery. Or you can say... "Ah no! young blade! That was a trifle short!" "You might have said at least a hundred things" "By varying the tone... Like this, suppose... Aggressive!" "Sir, if I had such a nose I'd amputate it!" - "Friendly: When you..." - I got it. This is all comedy. I'm not as brave as Cyrano. - I shouldn't have told you. - It's not that. I feel so bad when people attack me. - Should we give it a try? - What? I say awful things and you say even worse. Right now? If you want... It would be easier if you had nicer clothes. What? That's completely off-topic! That's none of your business! Oh. It started already. Forget it, I like your mismatching colors. That's not true. My clothes are... I don't know what to say. First rule, don't try to defend yourself. No "it's not true". - What can I say then? - Second rule, agree with the person. - "Yes, you're right." - Really? - Third rule, overdo it. - Agree with that? Absolutely. So, when I say your clothes are awful... I answer... You're right, my clothes are awful. So true that... I look like a bag of potatoes. Perfect. Good formula. "So true that..." - Let's do it again. - What's the use, idiot? No, this is to harsh. Be easy. If you can't answer to my insults you won't achieve anything! - Stop the fuss and... - I'm not a "fusser"! I'm... a chippy. Right? - A little of big one? - A huge one. Enormous. The biggest ever! Congratulations. Well... No I have to pick a fight with Seb and test it. - Do you want a cake. - Trying to buy me with sugar? - You're like my father. - I just wanted to buy you a cake. - What are you saying? - And I'll do it. You want a tart? Sugar free or not? - I don't want your money. - What's gotten into you? You know why I want to buy you a cake? I have something to celebrate. Yesterday, I girl tried to seduce me. I didn't fell for her! I stopped her. What an achievement! You didn't chase a girl? Wow! What's going on? Is this a frame-up? You know what? The dictionary thing was really mean! Eglantine, we talked about it. I said I was sorry. Well... still! You want to know how I could resist that girl? I thought about you. I'm different now. In the past I would have... Anyway... I messed up! I'm such a loser. It's my fault. Forget about irony. - Do you think I'm a puppet? - Not at all! We're together in this, Eglantine. I can make mistakes too. - What are you doing here? - Nothing. What do you mean, "nothing"? You're searching my stuff. No, I was tidying.. Someone must clean from time to time. Really? I can tidy my own place then. Get out! Eglantine, I'm your mother! Don't talk to me like that! Don't search my stuff! I'll cook the peas. Yes, you go cook the peas. 15 minutes left. - Are you angry? - Sad. Guilty? Lost. I'm fed up. What would you like right now? - Going home. - No, I mean in your life. What do you really want? That people leave me alone and let me live my life. "People". Who are they? Anybody particularly? - Her. - Yes? Mom. Imagine I'm your mother. What would you say, here and now? I want her to leave me alone. Say "Mom, leave me alone". You don't really look like her. I can be your mother if you really want it. Eglantine, do you have something to tell me? Let me live. What? I didn't hear you. Let me live. I still can't hear. Don't you dare talking to me? Let me live, I'm begging you. What? Let me live. That's my daughter! Asking for permission. You're right, I decide. I'm not asking, I'm deciding. Let me leave, leave me alone! - What? - Leave me alone! - What? - Leave me alone! - What?! - Leave me alone! How do you feel? Your back? I feel better. Okay, you seem relaxed. Thank you. What are you doing here? How do you like my uniform? With your dad's wage you need to work here? What will you eat? 2 Hot Towers, 2 Hot Wheels, 3 beers. Seb, I heard therapists are as crazy as their patients. Really? How's yours, Eglantine? He's so crazy! But not as much as me. You know I'm completely crazy. 107 Fr, please. Eglantine is really crazy. To put French fries on your head when you wear a hat, you have to be crazy. I'm on a break for 10 minutes. Long enough, don't you think? Let's go to the restroom for a quickie. Isn't it what you're waiting for? Come on, Seb. You'll soon find a new girlfriend, do me quickly. No? Hell, you really don't know what you want. Damn! I'll tell my girlfriend to work her. Why did you say yes? Isn't it what you want? I'll go if you're not interested. - Cut the bullshit! - Bullshit? You're the one messing up! - Wake up, you've changed! - This girl is driving you crazy. - Are you disappointed? - Yes. I can't stop my game with Sébastien. But when I'm here I can do it. Is it your point? Is it a trick of yours? What's important? Try or succeed? A tricky or efficient move? Why does Sébastien act like that? One day he is very nice, adorable. The day after he is unbearable. Did you ever had a tender but cruel friend? You're right. Did we talk about that? These are the most succulent relationships. Hug. Slap. Hug. Slap. It helps blood running. A small change is a good start. It's like tearing a piece of fabric. - What is it? - I want us to stop. - Stop what? - To stop. You don't love me anymore? I don't know. It's impossible. What did I do? - Is there someone else? - No, I just don't want it, that's all. Where is your mother? In her bed. What a spectacle. You're right, it's pitiful. I wonder why you married her. It's true. If I were you I'd push her in the stair next time she's drank. Don't you say that! Great trick. Sébastien dumped me, my father slapped me, my liver aches. Any more good suggestions? You're thinking of your glass as half-empty. What about the half-full side? I don't think, I have no glass. - We all have one. - Not me. Poor little Miss Laville. Doesn't this way of complaining remind you of someone? Anyway, in the half-full side of the glass you don't have, you broke two games. With your father and Sébastien. You call these a success? If you die tomorrow, maybe not. But if you keep your goal in mind, in the long run, yes. - But I'm ill! - It's good to see you're still human. You're allowed to stumble. Your disease is a proof you keep going on. My liver started aching before I met you. You're right, silly me. But thanks to this therapy, Sébastien dumped you and your father slapped you! Reassure me. Free yourself. Your relations don't enjoy it because they cling to the old habits. That's not what's important. Still, I don't like the half-empty side. I can tell your mother is neither depressive nor alcoholic. You're right, I don't know. I was lucky. My mother was hysteric and I had many inadequate fathers. - Should we trade? - No, I'm fine. Sébastien! Sébastien was different, do you understand? I don't understand. I was talking about a normal young girl. You're the biggest chippy in the world. And you have no glass. I don't know. You could sell your cheeks. They call for slaps. Come one, 300 Fr for each cheek. I'd rather be slapped than sell my cheeks. It's not an easy business. You have to find people as masochist as you are. - It will be free for you. - No, please, don't hit me! You have to accept, I'm your only client. I'm unmasked! See? 30 or 40 more years of therapy, and you can be happy. I've had enough of your bubble gums and your lateness. Your cellphones. Your small papers. Let's do it. "Sébastien, don't forsake me?" Translate it. If you go to England, you may need to be able to say that. Forsake. Miss Laville, I'm sorry you have to do this, but I can't take it anymore. Either you translate it or the headmaster will call your parents. How do you say "forsake "? - Forsake. - Yes! Forsake. You can also say abandon. So... "Sébastien, don't forsake me." The continuation. "I'm changing." - I'm changing. - Good. And? I love you. Very good. You are the Sébastien on the paper. That's my business. Hours of detention on a Saturday. Would that be your business? I'm listening. What is your answer? Let me know when you have changed. Who can translate? - Let me know when you have changed. - Perfect. See? Languages can be useful. Another paper to translate? I'll stop the therapy. The need for stopping is part of the process. - But you haven't reached your goal. - I know. - If I want to stop, I stop. - Okay. Let's meet last one time, as appointed, and end it properly. As you wish. - Will you go to Charlotte's party on Saturday? - Maybe. See you on Saturday then. By the way, I have a bad new for your friends. I stopped the therapy. They will have to find something else. Hey! What, "hey"? You asked me to tell you when I changed. So, "Hey". You stopped the therapy? The therapist didn't want to sleep with you? Is that all you can think about? I thought about it too and I think you are right. Stopping the therapy right now has a lot of pros. You're note the same Eglantine anymore. There were some painful moments but I think it was worth it. By stopping now, you can avoid more difficult moments. It's smart. Are you making fun of me? No. But you made up your mind so I'm looking at the bright side. - The full side of the glass. - What about the empty side? Miss, either you stop or continue the therapy... always look at the bright side of things. The Eglantine you like. You are disappointed. To be honest, yes I am. Maybe I went too far or missed something. But I was wrong to believe I could control everything. Being a therapist is not like driving a machine. It's collaborating with human being. And a human being is... rich, complex, unpredictable. Sometimes one can't take it until the end. Unless one accepts it all. - Hello. - Hi Madam, it's Françoise. Can I talk to Eglantine? She doesn't pick up my calls. Hello Françoise. No, Eglantine went out. Can you... Oh, right! She told me she was going to her therapist. Sorry, I'll call again. What did you say? My daughter doing a therapy? Are you sure? No, no. It's not what I said. She told me she was going to... to Serapi. Nicola Serapi, a schoolfriend. I have to go, goodbye. - So you're doing a therapy? - Maybe. There is no "maybe". It's either yes or no. If it's yes... You want me to stop, right? It may be on-trend, but you don't need that. I see, it's for the mad only. What if I decide? Eglantine, we are your parents and you are a minor. You mean you won't provide for me if I don't stop? - I hope you didn't pay your therapy with the money I gave you. - Why? I didn't cheat. You've been loving me with money for years. You never told me what I was supposed to buy. Also I tell you when I get bad grades. Then I had to find my own way of making money. Oh my god! Yes, you guessed. I'm selling my body. It's hard but the pay is good. My little daughter! I work in a fast-food restaurant! And I'm not your little daughter! Enough, stop this. Listen, Eglantine. We may not be perfect parents, but we raised you as good as we could. It wasn't easy. Maybe we were clumsy. - But why be mad at us? - I'm not mad at you. I'm thanking you for learning me how to solve my own problems. - Hi, how are you doing? - Hi, Seb! Man, she was fast replacing you. Hey, Seb! Do you have a condom for me? A standard one. Come on Seb, I'm sure you have plenty. You owe me one, don't you? Forget it, I'll ask to Romain. You're good. You turned her into a nymphomaniac. What's this shit? Don't tell me you'll sleep with him. - Why not? - Shut the fuck up. You can't even use a condom. Eglantine, get in the car, we have to talk. Just 2 minutes. Wait, I'll be back. Eglantine, it's not possible, you can't make such a mistake. It's a mistake with him but it wasn't with you? You don't love him! What do you know? What do you know about love? I can't stand seeing you with him. It feels so weird. Jealousy is not love, Sébastien. I don't know. Some guys think seducing a girl is difficult. Or dumping is difficult. But with you, I'm beginning to understand that... the most difficult... is to love. Fuck, it's difficult. But I want to. With you. Sébastien, I want you. Now? Here? - Should I put one on? - Yes. You don't think I have something? No, of course not. But I have many venereal diseases. You'd better use one. Maybe this is going too fast. - Maybe we could wait... - Don't you want me anymore? You'll see, it's great. Easy. Was it good? Yes. Hold me. - Was it good for you? - Yes. - Do you still love me? - Of course! I'm so lame. What happened? We made love. Too fast, not well. Yes. I don't know if it's Seb... or if I'm frigid. But I didn't feel anything. Was it your first time? Yes. Frigid is a big word after a first experience. Did you ever masturbate? Sorry, you came back quickly, I didn't have time to change. Anyway, I'm pleased to see you again. Is it important? Yes, it happened that I... Several times. And? Well... It's was pleasurable. When you start studying English, can you be fluent the next day? Anyway, you went with him. Do you consider the goal of this therapy is reached? No. Money mother doesn't know about it. And... No. Well. What if I met her? My mother? Do cure her? No. - To make a progress in your therapy. - I doubt she will accept. - Do you know what my therapist asked? - We'd rather not talk about it. Wait. He asked that you go see him. What? Not that you do a therapy. You don't need one indeed. Meet him to talk about me. - So? - I said no. How can I drag my mother into this? I'm the one having problems. What if it can help you? Maybe, but... I don't like the principle. If it can help you, you shouldn't refuse. I don't want to bother you with this. Eglantine, I should decide if I want to do it or not. It won't cost me anything to meet that man. Let's call him right now. We'll be fixed. Do you have his number? - What do I risk? - End up being a drug addict in a sect. I'd say you are very courageous to... keep Eglantine near you, and prevent her from going out with boys. I don't keep Eglantine near me. Nowadays, most of the parents try to get rid of their children. Or they give them too much freedom, pretending that give them independence. Your choice of an attentive eduction is a difficult choice. It's a sacrifice. Anyway, I think Eglantine shouldn't complain for having a concerned mother. Why did you meet this... This guru? I met him for your daughter, not for me. So? Did he ask questions? No. He talked to me. It was... Unexpected. Christian! Darling! Have a seat, I'll give you a plate. - Dad. - Did you have a leave? Yes, one week. What did you do? A new haircut? No. - You lost weight. - Not either. Your sister does a psychoanalysis. And your mother talks to your sister's therapist. Not a psychoanalysis. A short therapy. - What do you think? - You guys aren't bored when I'm not here. - Life goes on! - Eat, Christian, eat. Anyway, good timing. Since everybody is here, there is something I'd like to tell you. Something important. I decided to buy a studio downtown. You are grow-ups now. You can take care of yourselves. To make things clear. Did you know about that, Mom? Your father is having a little crisis. You'll see him again soon. Do you think he has a lover? What did he mean by "You can take care of yourselves"? - Is he leaving Mom because of me? - How could I know? And he didn't say he was leaving Mom. Can't I do a therapy? - There is a train at 8:33 tomorrow. - You're going back? Fuck, my phone. I was wondering if you were going you to teleport yourself here. Freud had an interesting theory about forgetting. I didn't forget. My father is leaving us. Is it hurting you? Maybe it's because I did a therapy. I shouldn't have asked my mother to meet you. I wish everything could return to normal but I don't see a solution. I understand. You are lost. Either I stop or continue. But I don't want none of them. I'll call you later. It's me again. I was wrong to buy your excuses. I'm asking you to respect our contract. What can I do? Stopping because of your parents, continuing because of your parents... Isn't there another possibility? What? What do you think? Tell me if you know. I won't take the butterfly out of its chrysalis. That's how it is. Damn! It's Eglantine. The third possibility is to continue for me, not for my parents. It's nice having patients like you. An accident. Are you doing your therapy again? It's not the reason why I damaged the bear. Yes, I imagine. I just wanted to know how you were doing. So, the integral of 1/x - 1/x² is... log(x) + 1/x + d Yes, very good Mr Douglas. I'm beginning to love it. What if I told you I'm doing a therapy again? I wouldn't care. As long as I don't have to do one myself. I don't really know how you were before, but... Now, I think... you're cool. - I'm ready. - For what? Go out on a date with Sébastien. Make my mother understand I can resist her emotional blackmail. How is it going with Sébastien? A lot better. Why? Imagine, one evening... you really want to see Sébastien. You can close your eyes if you want to. Breath slowly. You can see Sébastien's face now. His lips are smiling. You want to be hold my him. Let's go back in time now. You're home, ready to go. You know how your mother is going to spend her night. But you have chosen Sébastien. You can trust your unconscious mind. You can find the resources you need to live the life you want. You're so right to abandon your mother. I'm not abandoning you, Mom. I'm just going out. And you know what? I had sex with Sébastien already. It was okay. He didn't dump me. You don't need that anymore. It will happen soon! He hasn't dumped you. But he'll soon. They're all the same. All the same! They seduce you and take advantage of you. Then they dump you. It's a woman's lot, my daughter. This is what you passed on to me for 17 years. Damn! I won't take your affliction anymore. From now on, you leave me alone. Hello? Yes. Mrs Laville? What can I... Yes. Mom, leave me alone! Are you okay? What do we do now? Let's go. Do you remember when you told me... I was the type to sleep holding hands? I'm that kind of girl. Is that what you want to do tonight? Are you kidding me? Impossible. You don't have to tell your friends. Turn off the light. I'm not even sleepy. I love you. Mom! Don't move! Touch me and I'll jump. Mom, come down, I'm begging you. I'm fine here, facing my future. Step back or I'll jump. Why are you doing this? Entertainment. Your father has fun. You have fun. Why can't I? - Did you drink? - No. Just a bit yesterday. How long have you been here? I don't know. An hour, maybe. I spent the night thinking. You'd go home. You wouldn't abandon me like that. But, no, you didn't came back. I understood I was meaningless. Nothing. What do you want now? You want me to say I'm sorry? - You want me to break up with Sébastien? - Do what you want. I can't. How could I with a mother our of her mind? I'll jump, Eglantine, I can't take it anymore. Nobody will miss me. - Mom, stop. - It's too late. Mom! Mom, I don't want to lose you. If you jump... I won't think I'll be responsible. Neither Dad nor anybody else. It will be because of something disgusting inside you. I'll be sad. So sad! My big daughter. My big daughter. Congratulations. I think I've reached my goal. You did. - All the problems are not solved. - Oh, no! But, well... The coming of the night doesn't mean the sun is dead. You dug yourself out of the shit. You took a shower. Now you can try to understand how you fell. - Selling your tricks again? - I can offer you a guide. I'm fine. I can fill my own glass now. But I'm listening. What's the trick? There are different methods. They can help you reach new goals if you feel the need. - Thank you. - Thank you. Do you allow me to tell your story? Yes. So, Mrs Laville... Can you cure infidelity? I can't cure infidelity with medicine. But I can help people that suffer from being cheated on. I don't think infidelity is a disease. It just proves there is a problem in a couple. - Are you the unfaithful one? - No. It's my husband. He has a big problem and I'd like you to help him. Subtitles: tadanobu@KG
