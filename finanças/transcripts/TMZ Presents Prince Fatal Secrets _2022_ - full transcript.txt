(electronic music) - We broke a story that shook the world. - This has gotta be some kind of publicity stunt. - I didn't believe it, he was just here. - [Narrator] But it was true. Prince was dead, dead in his mansion. - At the end of the day, he's alone in an elevator. That killed me. - [Narrator] April 21, 2016. Prince became the latest victim of a dope-sick nation. - He got the Vicodin pills and it was laced with Fentanyl. - [Narrator] Turns out prince became a drug addict after suffering a terrible injury. Hard to imagine because of his public image. - He scorned people who took recreational drugs. - [Narrator] Prince was a health nut. Deeply spiritual. He hid his addiction from everyone. - He even hid it from me, and I'm an expert. - [Narrator] Fact is, days before his death, alarm bells rang, but they got muted. - [Flight Control] What's the nature of the emergency" What's the condition- - An unresponsive passenger. (dramatic music) - [Narrator] Prince was at a crossroads in his life. - He knew, this run that he had had, was ending. - [Narrator] Did he have a premonition of his own death? - It's just such a loss, I can't, I'm sorry. - Prince dying doesn't compute, because there's so much of him that still exists to this day. - [Narrator] TMZ presents... (dramatic music) "Prince: Fatal Secrets". (siren wailing) - [Dispatcher] Two one car for a medical, Paisley Park, 7801 Audubon Road, 7801 Audubon Road, for a male down, not breathing. - About 9:43, we received a medical call at Paisley Park in Chanhassen. They found an unresponsive male in the elevator. - [Chief] Dispatch from Chanhassen Chief one. CPR started. - CPR was initially started, but was unsuccessful. He was pronounced deceased at 10:07. We have identified him as Prince Rogers Nelson. - We are following the breaking news of a death at Paisley Park in Chanhassen. TMZ has confirmed that it is Minnesota music legend, Prince. - TMZ reported his death probably about an hour ago. Fox News is now confirming that. We're still learning more about what actually caused his death today. - On April 21, 2016, we broke a story that shook the world. Prince, one of the most accomplished, eccentric, and admired performers in the world died alone in an elevator at his suburban Minneapolis home, Paisley Park. He was just 57. - This has gotta be some kind of publicity stunt or something like that, 'cause it can't be real. - The world mourned and his legion of fans were heartbroken. - I didn't believe it, he was just here Saturday. He was just here Saturday. He was fine. - [Reporter] What was it that you're gonna miss the most about him? - Everything. I just can't believe he's gone. (mysterious music) - I'm feeling, heartbroken, joyful, memorable. I have a lot of emotions right now. - The people closest to Prince were shocked and devastated. - At the end of the day, he's alone in the elevator. That killed me. That killed me. That really hurt. - The cause of death, an accidental overdose of Fentanyl, the powerful synthetic opioid that has plagued the country, and it unlocked a mystery. How could someone who was so health conscious and anti-drug become so profoundly addicted? - Prince didn't think that he was taking Fentanyl from the evidence that we had. We don't believe that he knew that the Vicodin he sought out and took was laced with Fentanyl. It was a counterfeit pill and that's what's horribly tragic, 'cause it was preventable. - None of it made any sense, not even to those in his tight inner circle. - See, Prince was a health nut. He rarely ever drank, never smoked, banned meat from even being around him, and threatened to fire anyone who did drugs when he was on tour. - I mean, you know, Prince was an extraordinarily healthy person. Look, from his teens and his early 20s. He's very much like "I don't do drugs "and I don't want people doing drugs around me." He was like, "I want to be in control of myself "and my surroundings at all times." So in the '80s, when like, everybody, especially everybody in rock and roll, is doing cocaine, Prince is like, "If you find anybody on this tour who's doing cocaine, "we're gonna fire them." - I was lucky enough to see Prince in concert, half a dozen times, and I gotta tell you, this guy was not just athletic on stage, he was absolutely acrobatic. Jumping, dancing, and always in his signature platform shoes. ("Little Red Corvette") - His performances on stage were not that different than the performances you would see in the recording studio. His performances in the recording studio were always 100%. He performed every time he had an instrument in his hands. He played piano very much like a drummer, a very percussive style with his fingers. You hear it in his fingers. You hear the percussive nature of the attack in his fingers. (energetic piano music) ♪ Somebody say, woo-hoo-hoo ♪ - Same thing when he played bass, when he played guitar, when he played drums, his whole body was like a musical interface. (upbeat music) - It was those hard-hitting performances that may have started his long downward spiral and his dependence on powerful pain killers. His famous moves may have slowly destroyed his body. (upbeat music) - He been dancing around in heels for a while and that does take its toll, you know, wearing high heels on stage and jumping and dancing. - He was in chronic pain, but needed to keep going because music and performing was all he had. That's the only way he had of interacting with other people. (blues guitar wailing) So when you're in chronic pain and the only way to interact with people is through music, you have to do whatever it is you can do to get back to playing music, otherwise you're completely shut off from the world. - Prince was suffering in private and very few people knew about that or how he managed his pain with drugs. It was a closely guarded secret. - You know that little groove we was working on earlier... - Oh, yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah... (indistinct) Yeah, Simon, let's do that. He even hid it from me, and I'm an expert... (laughs) from back in the day, okay? I'd be able to tell if anyone was in pain. ♪ All you've got to do is ♪ ♪ Snap your fingers ♪ - Toward the end of his life, signs of real trouble started to emerge. The Purple One became a shell of his former self. Ravaged by health issues, opioid addiction, Prince was withering away in secret. - Prince was like a human skeleton, weighing just 112 pounds. He was temperamental, forced to cancel shows, something was seriously off. - [Detective] In the last couple weeks, how's his personality been? - [Meron] Well, he's just been kind of quiet. - [Detective] Kind of quiet, is that normal for him? - [Meron] Well, not really. - [Detective] Not really? - [Meron] He usually emails us, normally, throughout the day, but because he wasn't feeling well, that's what I got out of it. - So it all came to a head about a week before he died when a private plane Prince was traveling on was forced to make an emergency landing. Prince had ODed on Percocet. - [Flight Control] What's the nature of the emergency? What's the nature of the condition? - [Pilot] An unresponsive passenger. - [Flight Control] Was it a male or a female passenger? - [Pilot] Male passenger. - He survived, but just barely, and this really should have been a red alert for everyone. But instead, it seemed that people did not wanna believe that Prince had ODed, and things would only get worse. Six days later, one of the world's most electric performers would be dead. - It was all so baffling. How could a man who seemed like the picture of health who showed unbridled energy on stage, who was loved by millions, die so young from an opioid addiction no one seemed to know about? - Well, if you think Prince had no one to blame but himself, it was far more complicated than that. Somewhere along the way, someone had to have enabled him, whether it was a doctor or someone on the streets. - Even if anyone had stepped in to help him, he was probably too far gone. - So this story begins in Prince's youth. He was a small kid from predominantly black North Minneapolis, but even back then, he was not afraid to speak his mind. - Are most of the kids in favor of the picketing? - Yep. - How come? - I think they should get a better education too, 'cause, and I think they should get some more money. 'cause they worked big, working extra hours for us and all that stuff. - Music was in his DNA. His mom was a jazz singer and his dad was a piano player who did gigs at topless bars. But there were health problems early on. He battled epilepsy, and when he would have seizures, his classmates would bully him ruthlessly. - I've been having to deal with a lot of things, getting teased a lot in school. And you know, early in my career, I tried to compensate for that by being as flashy as I could and as noisy as I could. - The seizures stopped by age seven. Prince says it was because of divine intervention. - I've never spoken about this before, but I was born epileptic and I used to have seizures when I was young and my mother told me, one day I walked in to her and said, "Mom, I'm not gonna be sick anymore." And she said, "Why?" And I said, "Because an angel told me so." - When Prince was a kid, he was bused to an all-white elementary school where he experienced racism firsthand. A kid called him the N word, Prince punched him. - Back at home, his family life was less than perfect. - By all accounts, Prince had a rough sort of childhood. His parents, there may have been some domestic violence in the home, so when he is about 13, he's kind of homeless. I don't think he was sleeping on the street, but he was kind of like, sleeping on different people's couches. I think the thesis of Prince's youth is that he felt rejected by his parents and he decided, "I will become a rockstar "to show them that I am a worthwhile person "and that they made a mistake, letting me go." - Prince, as a young man growing up in Minneapolis, wanted to be famous. He wanted to be known. He worked so hard. I hear these stories from friends and they would tell stories of, kids come home from school, they throw down their books, they run outside and play. Prince would head straight down into the basement where there was a little recording set up, little cassette recorder, I think, and he had musical instruments there, and Prince would work all night. What kid does that? I mean, one night maybe, but on a consistent basis, night after night, after night, after night? Prince knew that he was talented and he wanted to make his mark in the world. - He had all these new songs written, that were great, and he had recorded every part on this little hand cassette machine. And he recorded, he hummed the piano part, and then he hummed the drum beat, and then he'd hum the guitar part, and he had planned it out, and he was able to execute it all himself, which is really rare, to be that objective over your own playing and not sound like it's one guy. He didn't sound like it was one guy. He managed to put different personalities on different instruments. - When I was younger, I always said that one day I was gonna play all kinds of music and not be judged, for the color of my skin but the quality of my work. - Amid all the chaos, Prince still dreamed of a better life, but he knew he could only accomplish it one way, through music. - By the time Prince was a teen, he'd taught himself to play every instrument he could get his hands on and had formed bands in his neighborhood. Before long, he was hunting for studio time. And once Prince got a taste of being a recording artist, go figure, it left an impression. (funky bass guitar music) - Yeah! I mean, listen to that. I mean, that is tight! I mean, who told him to do that? I didn't! (laughs) - 16, huh? - 16 years old. This is the first time he was in the studio. - I was observing one of the great musical geniuses of our time, at work, and I wasn't aware at that time, just how extraordinarily creative he was. To use his own lyrics, those kinds of cars don't pass you every day. - I started with a lot of appearances I was doing in and about Minneapolis and word just spread about me. - [Larry] So you were a local name. - Yeah, what I could do. A lot of people knew about me, 'cause I was, I used Stevie Wonder as an inspiration. Back then, I used him as a role model in trying to play all the instruments and be very self-contained and keep my vision clear. So, word spread very quickly about what I could do. A lot of people knew about it, yeah. - Prince was destined for greatness and he achieved it pretty quickly. After gigging in the local Minneapolis clubs and scratching for a record deal, it finally happened for him in 1977. Warner Brothers signed him, he was just 18. - Prince, through Owen and my cousin Cliff, got a chance at Warner Brothers 'cause Cliff was the promotion man for Warner Brothers. And they took the tape to Russ Thyret there, and he flipped out. He couldn't believe it was one guy. - This was a solo artist who got signed to a pretty big record deal with Warner Brothers, and that's pretty rare. And he was signed as a solo artist. It wasn't like a member of a band like The Rolling Stones or The Beatles, or Queen. On top of that, this young kid was from Minneapolis, so he didn't have anyone guiding him. Michael Jackson had Berry Gordy, and had the Supremes, and had his whole family. Prince was all alone. - Prince's first record deal comes about because he meets a studio owner, Chris Moon, who lets him basically move into the studio and live there, so he's up, surely, all day and night, figuring out the whole studio thing. He makes some songs. Chris Moon calls a manager and was like, "Oh my God, you have to hear this." The guy listens to it and he says, "Who is this band?" And they're "No no, it's one guy!" Like, "What are you talking about? "This can't be one person," and that leads to them getting him a record deal. Now, Prince chose not the deal that would've gotten him the most money because he wanted the most creative control. - His first album wasn't a hit, but music execs saw potential. So Prince kept at it, and in 1979, he released his self-titled album, "Prince", and as they say, the rest was history. - The album's first single, "I Wanna Be Your Lover" soared on the billboard charts, peaking at number 11, and going to number one on the R&B chart. At long last, Prince had arrived. (funky upbeat music) - What made Prince a superstar is he could do everything. He was a guitarist, he was a songwriter, he was a producer, he was an incredible performer, every aspect of being an amazing entertainer, he had on lock better than perhaps anyone in the world. - He would walk into the studio, sit behind a drum kit and start playing drums. He's playing an entire song, just hearing himself on the drums, and he's got all the parts and all the breaks all worked out. Then he'll pick up the bass and put the bass on, and then he'll go to the keyboards, he'll get a vocal mic, then he does his lead vocal and his backing vocals, and we worked that way, constantly. - I love Prince, I love Prince, I love Prince! - Suddenly, Prince was everywhere. His music, his lyrics, and his voice were all the buzz of the record industry, and so was his hypersexual style. - Is that your man? (fans screaming) - [Toure] Prince wanted to be titillating. - Tell me, baby, what, would you consider that man fine? (fans screaming) - Wanted to be sexual, he wanted to be noticed. - Tell me, baby, does that man have an ass like mine? (fans screeching) I didn't think so. - And he wanted the world to pay attention to him. Pushing the envelope in terms of how he was sexually relating to the audience was just so electric for him. - In 1982, he released his fifth album, "1999", another smash hit. - [Reporter] Places like Sam Goody have seen a sudden interest in the song. - [Caller] I'd like to request 1999, Rich. - [Radio Jock] Well, I can do that for you. - [Caller] Okay! - [Reporter] DJ Rich Davis says they are playing the song three or four times a day. - A typical day in the studio for us would often be 24 hours long. That was fairly typical. We'd all work together, we'd record rehearsals, and we'd finish that song that night. Go to bed early in the morning, six o'clock in the morning, sleep for a few hours and start all over again. Now, some people can do that for a day or maybe two, even a week. Prince did that every day. - He loved staying up and playing because for us it wasn't work. We enjoyed being in the studio and we would stay up all night. If you're having fun, why stop? - Prince's career is now on fire and it absolutely exploded in 1984 with "Purple Rain". - [Announcer] The star of "Purple Rain, - Oh my god! - Please welcome, - Oh, Prince! - His Royal Badness, Prince! (fans screaming) - [Fan] Oh Prince, Prince, Prince, I love you! - "Purple Rain" is what launches Prince forever into the top level of global elite super stardom. It's not just that... Well, it's partly that, finally he's made a rock and roll album. So now urban radio is all about it because we love Prince and rock radio is all about it because we love great rock and roll, so he's getting it all there. MTV loves it because it's rock, he's big, he's beautiful, these songs are great. And of course he said, "I need to make a movie about myself to accompany this", because he saw the power of MTV right away. - With the success of "Purple Rain", Prince is ready to go on tour. (upbeat music) (fans chatter excitedly) - These tickets are gold! (upbeat music) - I ain't just talking about any old kind of temptation. (fans scream) I'm talking about the kind of temptation that'll make you do things. (fans scream) - I thought he was absolutely spectacular. He has this amazing energy and this amazing feeling, and the show went on and on. I think he must have done over four hours. It was stupendous, and one of the best shows I've ever seen in my life. - And by then, of course, he'd become known for his extreme athleticism on stage. (upbeat music) - But for this tour, he was about to take it to new heights, literally. - One of the moments on the "Purple Rain" tour, there's a bathtub, and he's sort of like, you know, performing in the bathtub, what have you, right? And in one of the rehearsals, the bathtub... The manager, Alan Leeds, told me the story, the bathtub fell, and Prince took a quite long fall, and it was painful for him and had to go to the hospital, and this he marks as potentially the beginning of chronic pain. - The bathtub incident left Prince in a bad way, but he carried on with the tour anyway, with the same high voltage energy he became known for, wearing those platform shoes, no less, as he suffered through the injury. - I never had any inkling that he was in pain. In the over four years that I knew him, I was with him nearly every day of that time. I never had any indication that he was in any pain. When I was with Prince, he did not want to admit to any weaknesses. - There were other performance-related injuries over the years. - I swear to God, I watched him wear those high heels every day. Every day; I couldn't do it, I couldn't have done it. He wore all those high heels every day and he never complained. Never once. - All of his shoes basically looked like this, pretty much. - [Narrator] In fact, nearly all of Prince's 3000 pairs of shoes are identical, with the exception of color. Each pair had to match the fabric and shade of the clothes he was wearing. - Every time he was jumping up to do the splits, I was holding my breath, hoping the heel doesn't break off. - There was clearly an almost athletic grinding-down of the body over many, many years. So I mean, at the point at which most athletes are like, "I'm in my late 30s, "I've lost a step, I'm going to walk away from the game," Prince is not doing that, he's still out there performing globally, long tours all the time, so yeah, over time, the hip, potentially the lower back, the knee, start to really bother him. He's not one to complain. He's not one to talk about his sort of pain. - Now many believe this was the beginning of Prince's downward spiral and possibly when he started using high-powered painkillers, all for the sake of his music and for the sake of his fans. (fans screaming) - We want Prince! We want Prince! We want Prince! We want Prince! We want Prince! - From the outside looking in, Prince was on top of the world. His music was killing it and his performances were as electric as his songs, but internally, he was suffering, keeping it mostly to himself. - When a, especially a young person is trying to figure out how to navigate being a celebrity, they have to create kind of a psychic shell, a barrier, that protects themselves, their inner selves, from an audience, from judgment, and he created that psychic barrier early in his career and it protected him well. You set up a barrier between yourself and the rest of the world, so you can preserve that most precious thing you have, which is your own inner thoughts, your own inner creativity. But, in the world in which we live, we are obligated to rely on other people to solve some of our problems for us or answer some of our questions for us. I imagine, if you've become so self-reliant, that you only trust your own counsel, you're at risk of making some really bad decisions. - Prince was certainly not letting everybody around him know how much pain he was in, or that he was taking medication for the pain. He certainly was like, keeping that quiet. So then to find out that, later in life, he had turned to medication to deal with chronic pain, which had come from working so hard to be a rockstar, was heartbreaking and surprising, in that, early on rejecting of drugs the first half of his life, like, completely rejecting of drugs, and then the second half of his life falling into something else. - Years of intense physical dance moves on top of that bathtub mishap took its toll on Prince's body, but he never complained about it or said what he was doing to mask the pain. If you looked at him on any given day, he seemed fine. - Here's another thing. Part of the reason no one suspected Prince was on hardcore meds is because he was a total health nut, and opiates seemed totally contradictory to his entire being. - Being around Prince made everybody else want to be healthy because that was the example that he set, all the time. - For starters, he was either a vegan or a vegetarian for most of his life. He believed meat eaters were living a, quote, "barbarian lifestyle" and filling their bodies with bacteria. - He was not a health nut when I worked with him in the '80s. He lived on Doritos, Constant Comment tea with a ridiculous amount of honey, Five Alive in the morning, fruit drink, beverage. No, he was not a health nut. He became one around the time of the film, "Under the Cherry Moon". You're aware that you're not young anymore and if you wanna continue to look good, you have to eat well. But I did observe that he changed his eating habits in the late '80s. - Are you, you're vegan or you're vegetarian? - Vegetarian. I don't mess with no red meat though. - No, no, no, no, you wanna live! - Well, somethings... - At Paisley Park, his edicts were strictly enforced, no booze, no drugs, and definitely no meat. - There were times when he was very serious about being a vegetarian, to where he wanted the band to also be vegetarians and people would go along with it while he was there and then when he wasn't there, they'd eat whatever they wanted to. - We were not even allowed to eat meat inside of the building. There's a shopping center near Paisley Park where we used to go Subway, and outside of Paisley Park there are patio table and chairs. We had to eat it outside and throw it away outside. He didn't even wanna smell it. - [Chris] I dunno how you take care of yourself, but I promise you, he probably took care of better than you do. What he ate, like, what he put in his body. He would never put McDonald's, or you're eating this, or you're eating that. He changed up most of the people's diets. People who came and start work for him, most of them became that way, you know what I mean? From hanging out with him. - His strict rules weren't just limited to his home. When he went on tour, he expected everybody, everybody, to abide by them. - [Cat] First of all, Prince did not allow drugs on the set, on the tour, around anyone. No one's ever done drugs on tour with Prince. Period. No one. - It's true. Prince was notoriously anti-drug and it goes all the way back to his youth when, then too, he wouldn't touch a thing that gave him a buzz. - He scorned people who took recreational drugs. He thought that it was a sign of weak character. - [Chazz] All musicians experiment and they lyin' if they say they don't, but Prince did not. He was 100,000,000% against anything or everything And he used to look at me and go like, he said, "Man," he said, "people that smoke that stuff, man. "People could sneak up on 'em and do shit to 'em." And I was like, "That's exactly how I'd put it" and he'd go, "I ain't never doing that." - Well, Prince kept up that sobriety in stardom and he ran a tight ship when it came to people using drugs, Members of The Revolution said he wouldn't tolerate even the smell of cigarette smoke and get this, he supposedly had spies on tour. - He had people on the tour, to back up, on our "1999" tour, he had people observing us on the bus. All of a sudden there was strangers on the bus, like, getting jokes and learning our personality. And you know, it was like a Big Brother kind of a shadowing thing. - On top of all of this, he was devoutly religious. Prince made it known he was a man of God. - You certainly would not think of you as a great believing soul. - Well... - [Larry] True or not? - I don't believe that to be true. - [Larry] Always were. - Oh, I've always known that God was my creator and that without Him, boy, nothing works. It works to a point, and then it just kind of deteriorates. Entropy takes place. - In 2003, Prince was baptized as a Jehovah's Witness. He regularly attended services at a local Minnesota chapter and even went door to door to proselytize. He also sent members to close friends of his to try to get them to convert. - He's like, "What's really gonna help me do this, "and for us to work together again," is he said, "us being brothers, we have to be on the same page." And he said, "I can't do this "unless I can bring you into the religion "unless we can pray together "and believe, have the same beliefs" and all of this. And at that point, even though my arms are probably like this, but my arms were crossed, because I'm like, "I'm not trying to do that. "I've never understood Jehovah's Witness enough "to subscribe to it." And then, after that, he had 'em coming to my door in Atlanta, like twice a week. - [Interviewer] Oh, he would send Jehovah's Witnesses... - Oh yeah! - To your door? - To your door. You know, because that's part of their thing. In order to be a Jehovah's witness, you have to spread the word. So you gotta go knocking, door to door, and I guess he considered himself doing it through his musical circle. - Awards are wonderful, but all praise and glory is due to the true God, Jehovah. - Prince's piety knew no bounds. In his later years, he reigned in his provocative image, toned down some of his oversexualized lyrics, and even censored some of his old material. - I've evolved by the simple fact of working on my spirit as a human being. I've been studying the Bible as of late, and it's begun to play a major role in my life so it's going to affect everything, especially the music, 'cause the music is so dear to me. - [Interviewer] So spirituality is helping you, not only musically, but affecting you lyrically as well? - Yes, yes sir. - And get this, at some point, he even swore off swearing and he didn't like anybody around him using foul language either. - I'm not using profanity because of our connection. - Mm-hmm. (audience laughs) - I have chosen to use the word artichoke, instead. - If I can stop swearing, everybody can stop swearing. (all laugh) - I like that. If you have a mishap in the middle of the night, if you kick the edge of your bed, what do you yell? - Artichoke. (audience whoops) - So now the question, how did a man so devoted to living a healthy, pure, God-fearing life become a drug addict and how did he keep it a secret for so long? - So Prince was living on the straight and narrow, but eventually, all of this intense performing caught up with him. In addition to that, he was dealing with a nagging hip and ultimately resorted to drugs, but it was a closely guarded secret. Even people in his inner circle had no idea what was going on. - [Chris] I never saw any signs of any addiction. I know the signs. I know what it looks like. - [Detective] So you're saying you never saw anything at all regarding being addicted? - [Chris] I never even saw any drugs in his belongings. I would have to make sure that he was up, make sure everything was together. When we were on the road and stuff like, you know, wake him up, help him get his stuff together. I never saw anything like pill bottles, pills, stuff like that. If you're taking pills, opioids, or whatever, you're gonna be drowsy all the time, you're gonna be like slurring your words, but never seen any of that. This guy had more energy than all of us put together. - [Detective] You've never seen anything, you only have gotten him food. Nothing that you've ever seen was suspicious or strange circumstances. - [Renville] No, that's (indistinct). - Okay. - Yeah, I've never seen him take anything of that nature. - [Andrew] Some people have even asked me about drug use, and this and that. And I don't know if I was that naive at the time, but I didn't recognize, I didn't recognize anything. The only thing that was a little oddball about was the hours he kept. He was a night owl, for sure. - [Kim] He was always traveling. He was always working. He had an incredible work ethic. I mean, he was just... Worked like a dog. - [Detective] You said you didn't have any knowledge of any use, drug use, or anything like that by him at all? - [Kim] No, that's why I was so shocked when all this came out. He was very, very meticulous about his diet and what he ate. So, yeah. - But clearly, at least some people had to know. - Princess's ex-wife, Manuela Testolini, actually told investigators she knew he was using narcotic pain pills during their marriage in the early 2000s. - Another ex in Prince's life, and one of his closest collaborators, Sheila E told detectives something similar. Although she says she was aware of his drug use dating way back to the '80s. - His ex tour manager, Theo London, told cops a story that, in retrospect, had all the warning signs. - [Theo] Prince asked me once to get him some pills for pain and so I went out and bought some, I guess it was Tylenol or something, and he got very upset with me and he said, "This isn't what I want, "I need something stronger." - While it's impossible to pinpoint exactly when he got hooked, and on what, what we do know is that, in 2009, as his hip pain worsened, Prince was prescribed Percocet. This according to multiple family sources. - I'm not blaming someone, 'cause everyone is responsible for their own lives, but I think it's just so easy to just go and get prescription drugs, that, it's scary. - The Percocet alone wasn't doing the trick. In 2010, Prince finally went under the knife for a hip replacement, and it was a big deal. Fact is, this procedure usually requires a blood transfusion, and that's something that Jehovah's Witnesses frown upon. - There's some people who talk to me about telling him, "You should get hip surgery. "You should get knee surgery. "These things can alleviate your pain." But by this point in his life, he's a Jehovah's Witness, they don't believe in surgery, so that is against his beliefs. Now, some people told me he may have gotten the surgery anyway, but he was struggling with his religious principles as well as chronic pain that was hampering him. - Unfortunately, it was far too late for him on the drug front. He was deep down a rabbit hole, before and after surgery, and for him, there was no turning back. - [Fan] Prince, huge fan, sir. - [Man] Prince, love you, buddy. - As we look back, it should have been easier to connect the dots, to understand what was really going on with Prince. In 2016, just weeks before his death, a sequence of events came together that cost Prince his life. - On the morning of April 7, 2016, one of Prince's closest friends and associates, Kirk Johnson, was deeply concerned about the singer's health. We know that because he reached out to his own doctor, Michael Schulenberg, and he asked for a house call to treat Prince for numbness and nausea. - An hour later, Schulenberg showed up at Paisley Park to treat him. Schulenberg says he didn't prescribe anything that day, but he did tell Kirk Prince didn't look well. - Later that same day, Prince canceled two shows, something he hadn't done in 25 years. The stated reason, a bout with the flu. - Prince was supposed to hold back to back performances at the Fox tonight, at 7:00 and 10:00. I've been in touch with theater officials. Just about five minutes ago, they told me they're still working on figuring out the rescheduled date for both of those shows. But meanwhile, the musician's illness is no doubt disappointing hundreds of fans. - The next day, April 8, Prince called Dr. Schulenberg to say he was feeling better, and the two of them started talking about a course of action to address whatever he was dealing with. - Now, this is where things get interesting. Six days later, on April 14, Dr. Schulenberg writes a prescription for Percocet, not under Prince's name, though. It was made out to Kirk Johnson. - That same day, Prince got on a plane to do the shows that were canceled the week prior. - Once again, I'd like to apologize for the cancellation. I was a little under the weather. (crowd cheering) But we're here now. (crowd cheering) I wanna take this time to thank you, each and every one of you, for coming out and enjoying this night with us. - He performed back to back that night, to rave reviews. ♪ Went to the doctor, guess what he told me ♪ ♪ Guess what he told me ♪ - All seemed well on the surface, but backstage trouble was brewing. Singer Judith Hill, who had just started collaborating with Prince, was with him backstage. She later recalled her mentor seemed off. - Judith told investigators, "He was saying things like "he had done all that he was supposed to do on Earth." He also seemed really depressed, which unsettled Judith. - In the music business, these careers are short. If you reach the highest level of success, realistically, you can figure on a good five years at the top of the music business, but that rare air that you breathe at the very top of the music business is much, much shorter than a career in acting, I think, so he knew, this run that he had had was ending, and now he had a different problem to solve. Not the problem of, "Can I get them to believe that I'm a great artist," but the problem of "Can I get them to believe I'm a legacy artist." - Judith was concerned, but she didn't know the depth of the crisis. Just hours later, Prince would be at death's door in a private jet. - Prince's downward spiral reached a peak in April 2016. The blow-by-blow of those final days demonstrates just how far his addiction had gone and why it might have already been too late. - Shortly before midnight on April 14, right after his Atlanta shows, Prince, Judith Hill, and Kirk Johnson board a private plane back to Minneapolis. - Once the plane took off, Judith says Prince actually became more upbeat, but about an hour into the flight, Prince walked to the back of the plane and fiddled with his travel bag, came back to his seat, and fell asleep. Judith wasn't alarmed until she saw water from a bottle he was holding spilling all over the floor. - She wakes up Kirk, who then tries to wake up Prince, but he's unconscious. They alert the pilot, who radios Air Traffic Control telling them they need to make an emergency landing immediately. - [Flight Control] What's the nature of the emergency? What's the nature of the condition? - [Pilot] An unresponsive passenger. [Flight Control] Was it a male or female passenger? - [Pilot] Male passenger. - Six minutes later, Prince's plane makes a rapid dissent and touches down in Moline, Illinois. Paramedics are standing by and they ask if he's on anything. Kirk Johnson says he may have taken Percocet. - The medics gave Prince a dose of Narcan right on the tarmac. The so-called save shot for overdose victims, but it wasn't enough. Prince started to convulse, so they hit him again. This one worked. Prince was awake now and rushed to the hospital. - [News Anchor] TMZ had reported, apparently, that he had had some sort of medical emergency on April 15 that forced his private jet to make an emergency landing in Illinois. - It's now April 15 and word has gotten out about the emergency landing. Prince's team spun it as another episode with the flu. - [News Anchor] Prince performed a concert on Thursday night in Atlanta. He was flying back when his private jet had to make an unscheduled landing in Moline, Illinois, because he had been stricken with what was described as a severe bout of the flu. He was hospitalized and then released. - At 10:33 that morning, Prince sends out a tweet, quote, "I am transformed." When doctors come to see Prince, he tells them all he had taken was Aspirin, but he refuses to take any tests to confirm what was wrong. Privately, he tells Judith Hill he mixed up his meds and fell asleep, insisting he would've been fine if it wasn't for those Narcan shots. - Prince is obviously in denial. Doctors want to keep him in the hospital, but he demands to be released. He goes home that very day as if everything is fine, but just six days later, he would be dead. (tense music) - The day after Prince was released from the hospital, he was eager to show everyone all was well. He seen out and about all over town, riding his bike, going to record stores. That same night, he hosts a dance party at Paisley Park and it would be his last public appearance. - By now, his inner circle is in panic mode. They realize Prince's addiction is far worse than they imagined. They need to get him help. - On Sunday afternoon, Prince tweeted that he was feeling rejuvenated. - Prince's camp pumps the brakes on scheduling more concerts for the time being. Kirk Johnson also reaches out to Dr. Schulenberg to apologize for requesting the Percocet four days earlier, because he now realizes Prince has a big problem. - On the advice of his team, Prince agrees to take some time off from performing. That night, he joins friends for dinner and a movie. He later hits up a jazz club, a pretty normal day. The next one, however would be anything but. (tense music) The last full day Prince is alive, his team believes they finally found a solution for his drug use. They contact Dr. Howard Kornfeld, a California addiction specialist, who they think can be Prince's savior. - Kornfeld is known as one of the best in the rehab business, but he was too busy to drop everything and fly out to Minnesota for Prince. And this is where it gets a little strange. He sends his son Andrew in his place. Andrew's not a doctor. He's a medical school applicant who worked in his dad's clinic. - The plan is supposed to go like this. Andrew will act as his dad's proxy, make contact with Prince and get him to a doctor in Minnesota. - Once Prince was stable, the next step was to get him to the Bay area and check him into Kornfeld's rehab clinic. Obviously, it didn't work out that way. - As all these plans are in the works, Andrew was getting ready to take a red eye to Minnesota. Prince is still desperate for relief. Kirk says he was jittery and anxious. He demanded something that would calm his nerves. At 5:00 PM, they headed back to Dr. Schulenberg's office. - This would be Prince's last doctor's visit. Schulenberg gives him an IV, blood pressure meds and antihistamines. He also sends him off with a prescription for Valium. but warns him, "Only use it as a last resort." - That instruction goes out the window immediately. At 5:45 in the afternoon, they stop at a Walgreens to get some Valium. Surveillance video shows Kirk going into Walgreens. Meanwhile, we got a photo of Prince pacing in the parking lot. Witnesses told us he was extremely fidgety. Now the mystery deepens, because they apparently left Walgreens, but less than an hour and a half later, Kirk returns to Walgreens to get something and then goes back to Paisley Park. - Around 8:00 PM, Prince heads up to his quarters on his own. It is the last time he'll be seen alive by anyone. Kirk stays downstairs to meet with Prince's other assistant, Meron Bekure, to plan the next day. - Remember Andrew Kornfeld, the rehab doctor's son, is set to arrive at the crack of dawn with what the team hopes is a life-saving Hail Mary, a real plan of action to get Prince detoxed and healthy. - It was a plan that will go down in flames. - It's the morning of April 21, 2016. Kirk and Meron try reaching Prince by phone, but no luck. Around 9:30 in the morning, they drive to pick up Andrew at his hotel. Then drive back to Paisley Park. Once they're inside, Kirk and Meron try to find Prince. Andrew stays behind. - They went looking for Prince, couldn't initially find him. They saw the staff representatives apparently found him in an elevator, unconscious. One of the staff members started screaming. Andrew heard the screams and went to the elevator where he saw that Prince was unconscious. - Prince was lying on the floor of the elevator, still wearing the same clothes from the night before and showing no signs of life. At 9:43 AM, Andrew dials 911, telling the operator he fears Prince might be dead. - [Dispatcher] Paisley Park, 7801 Audubon Road, person down, not breathing. Chanhassen Chief one, 9:45. - [Chief] Copy that. Chanhassen Chief one, CPR started. - [Dispatcher] 10-4, CPR started, 9:49. - First responders rush to the scene. They arrive within five minutes. (horn blaring) (siren whoops) Just before 10 in the morning, paramedics tried desperately to revive him, but it was too late. At 10:07 AM, Prince was pronounced dead. - 90 Minutes later, TMZ broke the news. - Hey everybody, it is Harvey and Charles and we have very sad news. Prince has died. We just broke the story on the website. He was 57 years old. - That triggered an absolute media frenzy. - TMZ, that broke this story this morning, is reporting that maybe his death was not unexpected. - TMZ has been around a long time and there are a handful of stories that just gives me pause every time I think about them and Prince is one of them. - I will always remember what it was like in this newsroom the day we broke that story. - I remember as we got a tip that something bad happened to Prince. - It was just a feeling it was true. We had broken the story about his overdose on the plane, so we were aware that there were issues. - And we made phone call after phone call after phone call, and the picture became clear and it was hard to process, but it was true. And I remember turning to Charles and saying, "We have to publish this story." and it was heart wrenching. - On a personal note, for me, it was the saddest story that I've ever had to report. And I distinctly remember, once we confirmed it, and double confirmed it, triple confirmed it, that he was indeed dead, and I remember Harvey looking at me and saying, "Publish it." And I hit the button and published it. And I walked away and I cried. - Word spreads quickly. Friends, family, and fans start to gather outside the gates of Paisley Park to mourn their idol. Millions of others are grieving around the world. (melancholy music) (uptempo music) (people cheer and clap) (indistinct) - Oh my God, I was devastated. I couldn't believe it, I'm still in shock. I still can't believe it. - It's just such a loss, I can't, I'm sorry. - Ask just about anyone, and they'll tell you they remember exactly where they were when they found out Prince was gone. - I remember so clearly, exactly where I was when I heard the news that Prince was gone, that he was dead. I was driving my car and I was listening to the radio and I, literally, I teared up. It was so hard to believe and hard to fathom. But then I also remember people just spontaneously coming out into the community in downtown Minneapolis, outside of the iconic First Avenue, and gathering together. Literally thousands of people and singing "Purple Rain" and "Nothing Compares To You". ♪ Purple Rain, Purple Rain ♪ - [Senator] And you just got a sense of how much he touched people. - I was in Detroit, giving a speech about one of my books and I looked at my phone and it had, the number of texts and calls was far higher than I'd ever seen. There's all these people in front of me who were like, "Sign your book, say hi to me." And then, and I'm going through all these people, and one of them said, "Prince died." And I was like, "Get the fuck outta here, "Prince didn't die." And then I look at my phone and the numbers were absurdly high, texts and calls. And then I looked at this woman and she's like, "No, he really died, this is real." And I'm like, "Oh my God." And I get out of the hall where all the people were and all these calls are coming in. "Come on this show!" "Talk to this interviewer," whatever. And it was... Quite heavy, sort of like, I have to help other people put this in context. - As the bombshell news is processed, it's not long before there's talk about a possible overdose, especially after TMZ reported that he had suffered one on the plane ride back from Atlanta. Even then, many were skeptical. - Breaking tonight, TMZ reports that legendary singer songwriter Prince may have received treatment for a drug overdose just six days before his death this morning. - [News Anchor] Prince's representatives will only say that he'd been suffering flu for several weeks. We know that, two weeks ago, Prince also cited the flu as the reason for canceling a couple of shows from his "Piano and a Microphone" tour and the official explanation as to why his plane had to make an emergency landing in Moline, Illinois is because Prince was suffering severe dehydration. Clearly, TMZ is not buying that explanation. - That has not been independently confirmed by Fox News. That is TMZ reporting. They are also the ones who broke the accurate news this morning of Prince's death. - Meanwhile, the investigation into Prince's death gets underway. - Because this was an unwitnessed death of a middle-aged adult, the decision was made to process the scene. - Detective's interview members of Prince's inner circle and a common theme emerges. Just about everyone on his staff claims they had no idea Prince was hooked on pain meds. - [Renville] I was very surprised- - [Detective] Okay. - [Renville] That, you know, he was on any of that because, like I said, he leaves it all on the stage, right? He gives his all. - Two years later, officials announced what they'd found, and it was shocking. - The investigation has determined the following. On April 21, 2016, Prince died from an overdose of Fentanyl. Fentanyl is a very powerful synthetic opioid that is 30 to 50 times more potent than heroin and 50 to 100 times more potent than morphine. - The details were almost too incredible to believe. There were more than a hundred pills scattered throughout the house, in bottles that had nothing to do with the pills themselves. There might be a pill in an Aspirin bottle, not an Aspirin, and so on. - But investigators zeroed in on dozens of pills that were stamped with the code Watson 853, a common identifier of Vicodin. - 15 of the prescription pills that had the Watson 853 imprint on it were located in Prince's dressing room. Another 64 and a half of these pills were located inside a (audio skips) bottle and 20 and a half pills were located inside an Aleve bottle on the nightstand next to Prince's bed. Another loose pill was located in Prince's bed. Law enforcement found numerous pills throughout his residence at Paisley Park and some of the pills had Lidocaine and other agents and then other pills in the same bottle had Fentanyl. - But then, a stunning revelation. Those Vicodin pills were counterfeit and laced. - Representative samples taken from Paisley Park of the counterfeit Vicodin pills tested positive for Fentanyl. He got the Vicodin pills probably through the internet and it was laced with Fentanyl, and so people are playing Russian roulette if they're getting drugs that are not prescribed by a physician and it's on the street. - As Carver County made clear as day, most of Prince's Vicodin was essentially poisoned with Fentanyl, which is up to 50 times more powerful than morphine. But the question remained, where did Prince get them? And did he know they contained Fentanyl? - Nothing in the evidence suggests that Prince knowingly ingested Fentanyl. In addition, there is no evidence that any person associated with Prince knew Prince possessed any counterfeit pills containing Fentanyl. In all likelihood, Prince had no idea he was taking a counterfeit pill that could kill him. Prince didn't think that he was taking Fentanyl, from the evidence that we had. We don't believe that he knew that the Vicodin he sought out and took was laced with Fentanyl. It was a counterfeit pill. - In addition to the laced Vicodin pills, there were more meds found. Nearly all of them were prescribed to someone other than Prince, including Kirk Johnson, but officials insist those weren't the ones that led to his death. It was all about the Fentanyl. - In light of all this information, authorities decided not to prosecute anybody over Prince's death. They just couldn't pin it on anyone. The criminal investigation into Prince's death lasted two years. In the end, no one was prosecuted because the culprits just proved too elusive. - We ultimately determined that there wasn't evidence to charge anybody in that case, based upon an exhaustive and painstaking investigation by multiple jurisdictions. There is no evidence that the pill or pills that actually killed Prince were prescribed by a doctor. There is also no evidence to suggest any other sinister motive, intent, or conspiracy to murder Prince. There is no doubt that the actions of individuals around Prince will be criticized, questioned, and judged in the days and weeks to come. But suspicions and innuendo are categorically insufficient to support any criminal charges. In making the determination that no one would be criminally charged, that was based upon the evidence and that, after this exhaustive and thorough investigation, that law enforcement was never able to determine where these counterfeit pills came from. - Dr. Schulenberg was really the only one who suffered consequences. He paid a $30,000 fine to the feds for his shadow prescriptions, and an additional $4,600 to the Minnesota Medical Board for unethical conduct and mismanaging medical records. - Some of the people closest to Prince shut down any questions about accountability. - Is there anything that you wish you had done personally to stop his drug use? (chuckles) - Oh my goodness. Next. - You don't feel like people enabled him? - Next. - Opioid addiction is such a big topic of conversation. - Next. - Prince's family filed a wrongful death lawsuit against Walgreens, against Moline Hospital where he had been treated six days earlier, and against Dr. Schulenberg. - This morning, the family of Prince is suing the star's former doctor and several healthcare groups. Six of Prince's brothers and sisters filed a wrongful death lawsuit against Dr. Michael Schulenberg and Walgreens. The family claims all of the defendants had a chance, but failed to diagnose and help Prince with his opioid addiction before he died. - All of these cases were dropped. That is an indication they settled. - While the family may have come to terms with Prince's death, many of his fans, even six years, later have not. Prince just didn't fit the traditional narrative of a rock star who ODs. His drug addiction came from an unwavering commitment to perform for all of us, so there's something tragically poetic here. - Yeah, it could be somebody that's as famous as Prince and, on the outside, had this appearance of living a very healthy life, and he's not your typical drug addict that you would say, "Well, he's shooting up heroin." He was using painkillers and medication to treat his injuries and to treat the pain that he was in. - But this is not about rockstar hedonism. It's not about cocaine or these sort of things that we hear about rock stars doing. This is about doing like opioids, like the drugs that guys who work at the plant or women who are nurses or waitresses or whatever, people who have chronic pain, but need to get up to go work at UPS or whatever, are taking so that they can keep going. And he was in chronic pain, but needed to keep going because music and performing was all he had. That's the only way he had of interacting with other people. So he's taking these sort of drugs so that he can get up and go perform and interact with people that way. That was his entire identity. So that's sort of the tragedy of it, that he's not taking drugs to have trippy fun experiences. He's taking drugs so that he can get up and work, just like so many Americans. - But my strong hunch is that Prince never took pain medicine for recreational purposes. It seems highly likely that Prince was taking drugs in order to manage pain, severe physical pain, pain that he may have not been willing to fully disclose to the people close to him. I've talked with quite a few folks from my Prince days, and it seems a little bit to me like looking at a blank screen with just a few pixels. So you see these dots, you get these dots of information; a technician observed this, a girlfriend observed that, a band member observed this, an operations manager observed that, we all observed different aspects, fleeting aspects of a very complex person's life. He was incredibly private. There were things going on that were beyond anyone's reach. - And yet, Princess's legacy will hold up as one of the most fondly remembered in music. Fact is, he'd left his mark in this world. - Prince's death was one of the most shocking of the 21st century, partly because he was so beloved and partly because what happened to him was the exact opposite of his image. - Even Prince's incredible Super Bowl performance was memorialized by none other than Justin Timberlake, who honored the late legend. - Bottom line, the guy was, without a doubt, idolized by his fans and contemporaries alike. He just had that shine about him. And it's this memory of Prince's life that stands in sharp contrast to the dark reality of his death. - You could say it was a classic case of a double life. On the surface, Prince was colorful, flamboyant, and seemingly clean as a whistle, but underneath lurked a dark addiction, one that had been simmering for decades. - I didn't have a clue, and if I had had a clue, I'd like to think he might still be with us today. I could have talked to him. I could have addressed his issues in another way, or in a way that would've been... Healthier, for him. I would've definitely tried. I mean, it still affects me. I'm still affected. I still miss him very much. Well, what can I say? I still really, really, really miss him. I just pray that he's happy. I hope and pray that he's happy and at peace. - It almost like, doesn't really compute, like, Prince dying, because the notion of Prince is so large and the music is so timeless. His body is not with us anymore and there's no new music, but like there's so much of him that still exists to this day, that it's like there is so much of him that is with us. - I think it's highly likely that that private shell got harder as he got older. So I would assume that, later in Prince's life, he found himself perhaps more isolated from other, than he had ever been before. That's an assumption. I think there's always the possibility and other Prince colleagues and I have talked about this, that Prince knew exactly what was waiting for him at the end of the road he was on and that he chose to travel that road. I think there's a possibility because I knew a man who was always in control of his own decisions that maybe he knew exactly what he was doing when he was using pain medication, when he knew he was in deep trouble with it, he may have just opted to continue and go forward. - Prince was just one of tens of thousands of people who die from Fentanyl overdoses every year. But his death was so shocking, it opened the eyes of America. - It was shocking for people that knew him and certainly for his fans, that the drug addiction oftentimes is so hidden and that the public health officials have indicated that the way to address this is to start with the premise that no one is safe. And what I mean by that is that this can affect anybody. If Prince can die from a drug overdose, with his belief system and his focus on his health, then certainly anybody can be affected and die from a drug overdose. - Hopefully there are lessons to be learned here. If you're struggling, don't suffer in silence. Reach out for help. If only Prince had done so, he might still be here today. - He was in the grip of addiction. If anything, we could blame addiction and the struggle that we have as a society of dealing with that, the stigma that we place to that, which makes a lot of people say, "I don't want to tell people. "I don't want people to know. "I don't want to deal with it." I mean, there's other diseases that are okay for us to deal with. Addiction is a sign of weakness, supposedly, and it's a failure, supposedly, and it's not, it's a disease. But the addict is not going to be able to be saved until they are ready to be saved. - Despite his fortune and fame, Prince sadly became yet another statistic. He was one of 42,000 people in the U.S. who died of an opioid overdose in 2016. If nothing else, his death highlighted this profound problem which persists today. - The opioid crisis has been said by public health professionals as the greatest drug crisis we've had in America. I think in connecting this with the Prince case, if I could, is that perhaps shined the brightest light on the tragedy. He was so beloved on a national, on a world level. - There still exists in this country, deep stigma around addiction and mental health and it makes it that much more difficult for people to admit that they have a problem, for people to go and get the care that they need. But it's also important to see individuals like Prince, so gifted, such a complex person, in their full complexity and not to just see him as a two-dimensional character, What ended up taking his life, at the end of his life, this terrible addiction is certainly part of his story, but I don't think it overshadows his genius and the love that so many millions of people, especially people in Minnesota, feel for him. - Prince Rogers Nelson, a trailblazer, a beloved figure to millions. In the end, he was, just like all of us, imperfect. (dramatic hammering) (sonic whooshing) (logo chimes)
