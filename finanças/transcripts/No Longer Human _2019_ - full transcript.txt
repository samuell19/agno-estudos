Then you are bit weak.. - The sales of mine is huge tho I heard that You never praise me.. When you coming back? I'll be the one You so idiot What? You just got abused by them? - They called me to laugh at me The novel is vulgar. It is just a story of woman dumped. Naoya Shiga even didn't read it. - Give me a one Well. I enjoyed it, the Sun Setting - Of course. It is a masterpiece. Sold more than Sakaguchi It wasn't masterpiece. You used woman's diary, didn't you? Just for as reference I just wanted ideas. - But it drew you in deep You don't understand at all. - I do. It was not a story of woman dumped. But the story which woman dumps the society. If nobody understands that, it is because of your lack of skills. You saying I should write for idiots? - I'm saying write more intense even idiots can understand. Not enough.. I know.. Cut yourself by a knife.. show everything of you.. As if you cut someone, you cut yourself.. I can die if I can write something like that.. That must be called masterpiece. Don't you think so?

Who are you? - Mishima is a young novelist. Also a government official Well well Such an upper class greatest person Is it weakness, novelists write death in the novel? People are only interested in how you die. You made Japanese literature as a show business Do you have resolution to die in front of the reader? - You! Behave yourself Sir.. Sir..! Stop! Sir!! Disgusting.. Oh shit I failed again. Don't miss it the next time.. Don't you feel empty? No one understands what you really wanna tell You know that Then what made you keep writing?

He is not here all the time I told him to come back - He won't He is working.. with women He will. He will come back No.. too much.. Too similar.. I mean not to me I have seen someone look alike this Maria This is annoying Maria wants reputation I want my name on the book Why don't we go to Tokyo and ask the publisher? I will write a letter to arrange that Can't wait! We can finally meet Dazai-chan Do whatever you want Oh my.. Why the hell is this. It should have been solved with the 10k yen She used all..

I lived like that before.. you know? Everyday, I stare at Mt. Fuji from the window.. You always stay in the next room.. You remember that time? Wake up! He is not even thinking about you little Do you wanna know his plan? He stays in countryside and live alone - Get off me Why you don't understand He will run away from you. And live. He is coward. You won't have anything after all You won't such as a book like Sun Setting or even his child.. Because you have nothing. You are just a lover Cut it out! He will die for me Because I will do that for him Only I can stay with him forever Where are you going? - Hospital I just received a letter - And..? No.. my sister couldn't I wanted to stay with her in the end.. You don't have to come back.. Don't try to come back to the family It is meaningless Just destroy it. And you can write the masterpiece, right? You always think about us.. and couldn't die because of it. Even if you come back.. I won't have any respect for you I believe You can write something more Destroy Destroy us. And complete your true masterpiece. That is what you wanna do. Take care No sense abuse other people. Their books should be abused Naoya Shiga.. He is an amateur. He is just conceited.. That is why he looks great. They never know what is suffering..
