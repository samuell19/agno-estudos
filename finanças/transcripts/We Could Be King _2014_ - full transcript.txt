If we don't take significant action, the system will collapse. Man: The doomsday budget for the Philadelphia school district has drawn protest. William hite: The recommendations will be shocking, painful, and disruptive. Woman: School district leaders announcing late this afternoon that they plan to close 37 schools. This is wrong for these kids. These are children. It could be your children. Some 17,000 students in the Philadelphia school district could be impacted. Girl: They're taking everything from us. We can't afford books. We need sports. Man: This comes after nearly 4,000 layoffs and drastic program cuts, including in sports. Different man: I can't imagine Philadelphia without high school sports. We currently have half a dozen players playing in the NFL that played football in a public league. That might be a thing of the past. Woman: And now the details. After 99 years, germantown high school in Philadelphia is closing for good. Man: Students from germantown high will now go to school with kids from Martin Luther King Jr. high. Woman: Germantown and Martin Luther King high schools are among the most violent in the district and have historic and longstanding conflicts and rivalries. Different woman: We're putting together gasoline and fire. Man: It's a formula that adds up to a major safety concern. Girl: I think it's gonna be a lot of tension and fights and stuff because we don't really get along with germantown that well. Man: King on one sideline burning germantown flags, fights after every game. Philadelphia public school students head back to class on Monday, many of them going to new schools after a summer filled with controversy and conflict. Ed Dunn: Be proud to be here. Be excited about being here. It's August! It's football season! Dunn: One. Two. 3. 4. 5. 6. 7. 8. 9. 10. 11. 12. Dunn: This is game week. This is game week. We will not turn down. We will not tune down. We will not walk. We will not bend. We will not break. Hut. Boy: All y'all got to go block the boom. What y'all doing? Different boy: You got to get over, dawg. You have to get over. I'm getting over. You're not. Shut up, shut up. You're not. Both shut up. Dunn: Hey, ain't none of that. It ain't none of that. What did I just say? Brothers, right? You pull him up. Don't pull him down. William Wade: We have to merge these two communities not only on the field, but in the classroom and in the hallways and before and after school. Great, man. Way to fucking hold. Don't do that shit, dawg! Man: Get in the huddle. What the fuck? Get in the huddle. Get in the huddle. I hate this shit! Listen, listen, listen. It'll be on display tomorrow, all right. We need to make this whole merger successful. Let's go. Let's go. Get in the line. Hit the line. Dunn, voice-over: I was one of the assistant coaches at germantown high school and also a math teacher there. I was laid off by the school district. They're going through a budget crisis right now. Here at Martin Luther King, I am serving as volunteer head coach. I'm the person that is responsible for the program, runs the program, but I'm not even an employee. Boy: Boo. Ooh! Who's that? Daddy. Daddy. Daddy. Ha ha ha! I'm gonna watch football. Dunn, voice-over: It's gonna be an interesting school year. The kids, they're gonna be coming in tomorrow. Got our work cut out for us, but this is what I signed up for. Wade: In the past, king has been defined by its serious incidents. King had a bad reputation, and we're still facing that negative stigma that has been attached to the school. Now we're trying to reverse it and bring it back, and everyone knows if we don't, we don't exist. Good morning! All: Good morning! It's Monday morning, and I am a black baptist preacher, so I have no voice. Listen. We're here this morning not making a statement about the governor or the mayor or the foolishness of those that should be taking care of our children. We're here this morning because we are taking care of our children. Martin Luther King is turning around. It is not what folks used to think it is. It is not what folks are saying that it is because this is going to be a success story in Philadelphia. Protect us and keep with us, o god. Wade: Let's rock 'n roll, team. We have students arriving. We have students arriving. Wade: Girls, don't have time to talk. Find your shirt. Find your name on the wall. Hurry up. Wade, voice-over: We're a comprehensive high school. We have to take everyone that walks through the door. We have the largest special needs population in the northwest region. I educate the students that nobody else wants. Dunn, voice-over: There's 1,500 kids here. Transitioning from being in a different school environment, my role is to help ease that transition because I know so many of the kids from germantown. Wade: You have to educate children, and this year, we have to do more with less. Woman: Based on the city stats, only about 40% to 50% of you will gradate. I don't agree with that. Neither does any adult that works here. Girl: "I plan to move out of Philly" because it's not getting any better." "Hearing gunshots on a daily basis was nothing new. "If you live in Philadelphia, I'm sure you agree. "Life is rough. "Times are hard, and sometimes you want to give up. I do, too." Before, I went to germantown. Now I'm at king. I'm 6'6", 320, play football. I'm very shy. So usually, I wouldn't be doing this right now. Growing up, life wasn't perfect. I got bullied a lot, and you're acting like... When I say that, a lot of people can't believe it. I wasn't really a fighter. Man: We're gonna have 700 kids out in the hallway for 5 people. Lunchrooms are packed. Whoa, whoa, oh, oh! I was trying to break them up, but there was too many people, and it just turned into a big fight. I think I probably could have prevented it a little more, but I don't know the kids. This is not what I'm accustomed to. Man: This school is really out of control. Our kids are hurting. Some things need to right now change. Give yourself a round of applause. You survived first day. Whoo! So tomorrow, same time, we'll be back here getting started, following our lesson plans for the week. Narrator: Crime, poverty, and depression was everywhere in northwest Philadelphia where vikings rookie sharrif Floyd grew up. Football quickly became his ticket to gainesville and the Florida gators and brought him the realization of a dream. Man: The Minnesota vikings select sharrif Floyd. Angus, voice-over: Sharrif Floyd is my idol. If he can do it, I can do it. Voice: You have 3 messages. Man: Dontae, coach from Florida. How you doing, man? Been trying to get a hold of you. What's going on, man? What's going on in your life? Tell me about it. Call me back. I'll try later on. Bye. Angus: Ah, he wants to be a gator. Oh, yeah. Taking you to Florida with me, kitten. Angus, voice-over: My neighbor gave me this helmet. It's the only thing I got that represents Florida. Hola. Yo. I got Florida. That's the college I really wanted to go to. How are you doing, kid? How you doing? Mwah. When do you leave? To Florida? Yeah. I go down there next year. Man: You're gonna be famous. All: ♪ go, Dontae ♪ ♪ Go, Dontae ♪ ♪ Go, Dontae ♪ ♪ Go, Dontae ♪ ♪ Go, Dontae ♪ Woman: Ha ha ha! Wade: You are expected to go to university of Florida. That's where we want you to go. Do you understand? That school is strong athletically and academically. You have to qualify, ok? That's the Ivy league of the south. Do you understand? For them to even want you there, you have to qualify, son. Henderson, voice-over: I'm going to 11th grade. That's when scouts and stuff start looking at you. I need more colleges looking at me. So I got to perform better. King is like, we have a whole bunch of new faces. Only people you know is people you know. See new faces, like, "I don't know him. I don't care about him." We need to depend on each other, especially to get through the season. Can't do it by yourself. Hut! Are we playing tag? What are we doing? Yo, why is the defense playing tag? Get it chopping. Get it chopping. Hit it. Hit it. Hit it. Hit it. Hit it. Oh, see, these bottles are so dirty, like. We need some new bottles. We need a lot of stuff. That's "do not drink" water? Yeah. This water is not safe. It come out of a green hose down there, a hole in the ground. Girl: Dontae is so beautiful. Different girl: Who's Dontae? Third girl: Dontae, the big one. He's a awesome person. When I first saw him, I thought he was gonna be mean because he big, but he is so sweet. Like, he's delicate. Dunn, voice-over: Dontae has all these multiple scholarship offers, he gets so much attention, but he's a guy who hasn't grown up as a football player. He's a football player largely because he's 6'7", 320 with feet like a ballerina. So he's kind of outside of that culture and that mentality, even though he's this great athlete. Sal is the opposite of Dontae, where this is a kid that's been playing football since the crib, and you can see it every single time he steps on the field. He starts as our safety. There's definitely a lot of eyes on us. There's a lot of attention to see can this work. Man: We are king. We're gonna play like kings. We're gonna leave this field as kings. We came as kings. We gonna leave as kings. We are king. Henderson, voice-over: We haven't won a game in two years. To win this game will put this team on the map. Jon gurevitch: It is public league football from johnston memorial stadium in northwest Philadelphia. I'm Jon gurevitch alongside Kevin Reilly. Indeed this was a season we did not even know would happen. With all the budget cuts this year, a lot of these teams weren't sure whether the games would come to fruition. There's still a cloud of uncertainty hanging over coach ed Dunn, coaching as a volunteer and not completely clear on what his status will wind up being, and yet, ed Dunn has got some talent here. And you begin with their lineman Dontae Angus. He could be walking through an NFL locker room today, and they'd say, "he's a big guy for this team." One more guy to keep an eye on is junior sal Henderson, natural athlete with big potential. He is a player to watch. And hovering over all of this is the old rivalry between germantown high school and mlk. Unbelievable, a 40-year rivalry. I think that's why we have such a packed crowd tonight. Yeah. Let's go, cougars. Let's go, cougars. Gurevitch: And the season is under way. Dunn: Let's go, d. Let's go. Let's go, d. Man: Break the tackle! Man: Is it downtown? Dunn: Got to leave there unless they touch you downtown and go where the edge should be. Come on! Let's go! Man: Let's go, Manny. Turn it up, Manny. Turn it up, Manny. Sal, sal, sal! Gurevitch: Intercepted. It's sal Henderson for mlk all the way down inside the 40-yard line. Dunn: Let's go. Let's go. Let's go, y'all. Let's go. Yeah, baby. Let's go. Let's go. It's our turn to go, our turn to go! We're good to go! Let's go! Bring it in. Hike! Gurevitch: Joe Walker back to throw. Firing it down the left side. Whoo! Gurevitch: It's caught. Breaks the tackle. Touchdown, mlk. A real solid first half for mlk. The cougars find themselves up 14-nothing. Reilly: Shutting out gratz in the first half, they have really showed some aggressiveness defensively. Long way to go, though. They've got a whole second half to play. Hut! Go! Run! He's already in the huddle. Yo, Kareem, go to corner. This guy ain't right! Shut up! Hey, yo. Shut up! Yo, yo, yo. Shut up. Shut up. Shut up. Gurevitch: A little altercation here between the mlk players. Come on! Man: Get off. Get off. Get off. Different man: Y'all can't just do that. Y'all on the same team. Y'all got to talk. Dunn: Let's go! Man: Yo, yo, why you unsnapping? Why you unsnapping? Gurevitch: And the clock winds down, and it is over. The final score... Simon gratz 22, Martin Luther King 14. That was our game. Yo, man, they got to deal with us again. I know this shit hurts. It should. They got to deal with us again. You gonna take this walk with me? We in this together, right, to the end, family, little bro, big bro, right? All right. Come here. You balled out tonight, man. This shit not done. How you feeling? I'm good. You sure, man? No. I feel fine. Nobody likes losing, but I let it to get to me, you know? I need you to keep your head up, keep them dudes encouraged. They looking for you. They looking to you to lead them. All right. Love you, bro. Love you, too. Come on. I made you a plate. You still hungry? Yeah. Thanks. Dunn, voice-over: I'm kind of learning as I go. Not that many 27-year-old head coaches. A big part of what motivates me are my personal experiences. When I was in high school, one of my best friends was killed over pretty much nothing. It was over a video game or something silly like that. We lived 50 yards from each other. Me and him went to the same schools, you know? What was so different that he didn't get a chance to grow into adulthood but I did? That's the reason why I'm a teacher, that guilt that I didn't do enough then. We're in a triage. This is the emergency room. What I want to see is a school district be more responsible with the dollars that they have. They overspend, and then they close schools. It's really setting our kids up for failure because you've got one counselor in here. Woman: You got one counselor for thousands. This is a really bad situation. The only cavalry that's riding in for some of our kids is us, the folks that work here. Will we run out of time? Because just liked germantown closed, king could close, too. Man: Martin Luther King has to work. Germantown is not coming back. It's not coming back, so what are you going to do? One thing that I noticed, that no one was getting recruited. The kids have no idea, but every single player on our team has a highlight film. They think that if you're talented that you're gonna go play college football. There's an academic formula that you have to meet, and it doesn't matter how good you are. If you don't meet it, you can't play. Woman: Hey, Dontae, come on in. We've been talking about getting you ready for the next step. You need to qualify under ncaa. Remember I said that? Yeah. You need a 3.175 gpa in order to qualify by January 2014. Your current gpa based on ncaa requirements is 2.5. How do you feel about all of this, Dontae? Stressed. Stressed? This is pretty big. You are competing with over 500,000 other individuals for the coveted prize to go into an ncaa school. So you have to come with your "a" game. You got to step up. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. This dude just getting out here. Who? Dontae? Dontae, come here, please. We can't win without you being that guy that's gonna be out here first leading by example. We can't win. We can't win like this, man. Make this the last time, please. Cool? Yeah. All right. Fall in with everybody else, man. I hate them so much. The dynamic of the team is, it's split. Dontae is kind of on the outskirts, as a lot of germantown kids are. I played football for germantown. I was the first girl to carry the ball in the city. When the merge happened and we came to our rivals, some of my coaches asked me to come help. What's wrong? My shoulder hurts, man. Yes, yes, yes. That's why I'm gonna put ice on it. All right. Let's just try to get this inside, ok? You ready? Grace, voice-over: No one can beat them. Yeah. Ok. All right. I'm sorry. Grace, voice-over: They can beat themselves. We're gonna take our time. It won't be like, you know, someone took it from them. They'll just let it go. We got to do something to wake these dudes up, man. Man: When you lose to a team like that, it's so demoralizing. Different man: I think the way I'm processing it is that it's a culture thing. They're so used to being failures, they're resorting back to their negative behavior. This is what they're used to doing... losing. So they go back to the behavior that they're used to exhibiting when they lose. Man: Wake up! They're saying shit. What the fuck they saying, dawg? Hey. Stop saying shit to me. Come on. Let's just play and lose the shit. You're not giving me anything. You got to make a play. Defense, offense, you're not giving me anything right now. Take your helmet off. What happened? What's up? No. I'm good. I'm straight. Ain't nothing wrong with me. Announcer: Cougars down 13 at the half. Dunn: Get with your brothers. Pull him up. Keep your head up, man. The whole city counting on us quitting. The whole city expecting you all to quit now. Pull your brother up. It's our turn to shock the world. Hike. Announcer: Joe Walker with the football, shakes off a defender. Touchdown cougars. Yes! Dunn: D., keep your mind right. It ain't over. Announcer: Running into the end zone, mastery answers right back with another big touchdown. Man: You better show me something. Then keep throwing number two out, expecting 39. Announcer: Long pass. He connects, and it's a touchdown. Whoo! If we're gonna go down, we're gonna go down fighting. Announcer: The cougars desperately need an onside kick here. Let's go, baby. Let's go. Announcer: The kick is off. There's a scramble, and it's cougars' ball. Let's go! Announcer: So now just 19 seconds left. Dunn: They got to be straight to the ball. Sos, sos. Joe, Joe, Joe, Joe, Joe! Hike! Announcer: Walker throwing on the move. Complete. First down. Dunn: Good stuff! Let's go! Dunn: Let's go. It ain't over yet. Thank you. Let's go. We don't have no timeouts. Listen. 8 punch, 8 punch. Go get it. Get up. Punch that shit. We gonna win this game. Let's go. Announcer: Final play now here. Announcer: Mlk knocking at the door, faking a handoff, Walker with the football. It's inside the 5-yard line. Different announcer: That'll do it. Shit! P.A. announcer: That is the end of the game here, with the final score, the mastery charter north pumas 20... Yo, yo, yo, pick that up. Pick it up. Pick it up. Keep your composure. Yo, Joe, come here. Come here. I love you bro, no matter fucking what. We're in this. It's not done yet. I love you, bro. Pick your brothers up. Pick your brothers up. I love you. Come on. Let's go. Come on. Let's go. Let's go. Hold y'all heads up. Hold your heads up! It's not done! Walker, voice-over: Once we lost, everybody was like, "oh, well, king is just like how they were last year," and, "you know, they're not good." We lost because of our mental mistakes. Germantown came over. That's when the rivalry started going back and forth. We argue a lot. See, I'm a germantown alum, and us and king, we couldn't stand each other. I'll support him, but I'm not gonna wear them colors. You know, I'm so green and white. I can't wear the colors. Y'all start off 0-2. If we lose again, we're pretty much out the playoffs. So we have to win every game. Let's go, girls. Good morning, deja. Show it. Show it. I got a pass. Get to class now. Hey, Mr. Wade. Hey, Kay, what's up? Woman: Quiet, guys. So the vikings are part of the group that came in and took over Great Britain. Come in, coach Dunn. Coach, hey, how you doing, man? Good morning. I gave Dontae an award yesterday for perfect attendance, and he's not here. I just left his class. He's not in class. I'll call him. I'll call his mom. I'll get on him right now. Yeah, please. Hey, jounieta, it's coach Dunn. Hey, is Dontae with you? Ok. He's not in school, and I'm trying to figure out where he's at. Let me know if you hear anything. All right. Thank you. Angus, voice-over: I was always the biggest, any school I went to. In first grade, I was my teacher's size, I swear. I wanted to lose weight. So I lost weight riding bikes. Wearing that sweat suit, riding in the hot sun, I fell in love with bikes. I was never fighting. I was always quiet in my class. Then, you know, people started taking advantage, like, "he's big, so I guess if I fight him, I'll be popular." They'll have respect for me." I don't know. People always tried to challenge me. I got bullied. Call me, "you fat this, you fat that." You're like a gorilla." That's what really pissed me off right there. I was ready to drop out of school, leave school. I was ready to be done. This is gonna be a rough season. The team, they'll do things together, like work out together, and I never get invited. I feel, like, left out. It's because, I guess, I don't get girls or I don't fit the part, like I'm not cool enough, whatever. When I'm by myself, I just sit down and think about everything, and I end up crying. We don't have a lot of announcements. First of all, this morning, you're going to introduce yourself and let the student body know that you'll be doing the morning announcements, ok? You always open with a tag line that I always say... "it's another wonderful day here "at the promise academy at Martin Luther King high school." Say that quickly. It's another wonderful day at the promise academy. Ok. Girl on P.A.: Good morning. It's another wonderful day at the king promise academy. Take your belt off. Take your earrings off, your jewelry. Wait. Go back through. Those boots, metal tips. Step back through. Henderson: Got to talk to you, man. Dunn: I'm gonna talk to you. No. It's important, like me-and-you conversation. It's important. Henderson, voice-over: I feel close to coach Dunn, seriously. I have a feeling like he's my family. We talk about a lot of stuff, you know, a lot of stuff you wouldn't talk to coaches about. A lot of stuff happened that a lot of people don't know. You know, I walk the halls, and people don't know what my past was. Just by looking at me, you can't tell what my past was. I look like my life would be picture perfect, you know? Woman: That's adoption day. Henderson, voice-over: I live with my adoptive parents. My mom, my biological mom, she's in prison since I was 4. Me and my brother and my sister, we all got split up. Remember that first day I came over? I was in your room under your chair. Man, voice-over: Raising black boys is a critical thing because they can go through so much in this world. His mom is my cousin. So when she had some troubles, I didn't want the state to take him. So we kind of went there and rescued him and thought in the beginning it would just be for a short period of time till she got her act together. That never materialized. He had already been through something traumatic with his biological father... Abuse, physical abuse. Sal, voice-over: I have a lot of stuff on my shoulders, and, I mean, football is the only thing making it better. Dunn: Sal's father called me and let me know that early this morning, the police came into their home, you know, guns drawn looking for sal. They arrested him, you know, pulled him out of his sleep, and took him down to, you know, the precinct. Woman: Sal was charged with robbery, conspiracy, and possession of an instrument of crime. The victim's cell phone was stolen, and some person allegedly showed her a knife. Sal is not the person alleged to have either taken the phone or showed the knife. Allegations are really just that he was there. Dunn, voice-over: When stuff like that happens, I feel personally responsible, but, you know, it's not over yet. So whatever I need to do going into the future for him or for whoever, I'm gonna be even more committed to it now. Dunn: Why are the linemen tired? You did nothing, and you're walking. You don't want it bad enough. Everybody content with being below average. I'm not content with it. This is what we come from. This is what belongs to us. This, this is your land. We come from humility. This is not a private school. We ain't got Nike practice jerseys, pants, and the whole 9. We got mismatched cleats. We go to different schools, difficult situations, but that's not what makes us weak. That's what makes us stronger than everybody else. This should be your motivation. This is not an excuse. This should be your motivation. Humility. That's why we get in this dirt. That's why we get on this hill, so we remain humble. Nobody is above this hill. Nobody is above this dust, this dirt, this grime. We got our backs against the wall. Backs is already against the wall. We dug ourself a hole being 0-2. So now we need every single one of these. We got one more chance, one more chance to turn it up. Lost this last year, and this year, we need it. Yeah. They owe us some wins. Announcer: Both these teams are 0-2. 3 losses in a season is a death sentence in this league. It's nearly impossible to come back from 3 losses and have any hope of making the playoffs. Dunn: If we stay in as a family, don't point fingers, pull your brother up, don't pull him down, we'll be all right. Y'all trust me? Yes, coach. Y'all with me? Yes, coach. You feel me, right? Yes, coach. Let's act like it, man. Family on 3, yo. 1, 2, 3. Family. Dunn: Let's go, let's go, let's go. Yo, yo, yo. Announcer: Mlk kicks off. Oh, what a hit. Quarterback looking to throw... And it's intercepted, number 21 with some running room. Right. 536, option on one. Right there. Announcer: Walker back to throw, looking. He's gonna fire this one deep, and this is Delane hart. Touchdown mlk. Hut! Announcer: Congrats to the cougars. They win their first game in two years. That's what I'm talking about. Y'all better sound off like y'all like winning. Who the kings? We the kings. Who the kings? We the kings. Who the kings? We the kings. Who the kings? We the kings. We the kings. We the kings. We the kings. Who the kings? We the kings. Who the kings? We the kings. Who the kings? We the kings. Who the kings? We the kings. K-i-n-g. King! Voice on phone: You have a collect call from the Philadelphia industrial correctional center. This call may be monitored or recorded. Dunn: What happened? Sal: I was in quarantine for, like, 13 days. I was just by myself. All I can think about is the football team every day. You know, I feel terrible, and I wish I could help more. I need to put some cleats on, some equipment. Looking forward to touching grass again. I held down your number, man. Ain't nobody wear your number since you've been gone. Been gone for too long. You'll be in my thoughts, and we'll work through this. Dunn, voice-over: I think about sal every day. He was in the wrong place at the wrong time. He got a raw deal. It's because of the expectation that our society has for the kids that grow up in our community. Make sure you represent yourself properly. Represent the colors that you got on, the name you got on the front of your Jersey. Represent your family. Everybody's palms on the goal line. We do pushups, we spell out "humble and hungry"... H-u-m-b-l-e, "and," a-n-d, "hungry" h-u-n-g-r-y. If you cannot spell, just say, "uh!" I know a lot of y'all do that, anyway. "Uh! Uh! Uh!" All right. Everybody up. Spell it out. Down. H... Down. U... Down. M... Down. B... Down. I... Down. E... Down. A... Down. N... Down. D... Down. Down, up. 3... Down, up. 4... Down, up. 5... Down, up. 6... Down, up. 7... Down, up. 8... Down, up. 9... Down, up. 10... Let's go. Running. Set. Hut! Hut! Aah! Let's go! Yo. Announcer: And the cougars win big, 34-8. Dunn: Keep running! Now it's just a matter of tomorrow. You gonna be hungry enough to take what you want. Walker: Hut. Man: Dig in. There you go. Dunn: We'll take it. I'll take that. I'll take that. Dunn: Yeah, baby! Let's go! Let's go. Let's go, let's go! Let's go, let's go! Go! Aah! Let's go! Let's go! Hit it. Hit it. 3... 4... Hike. Announcer: And he is going to go all the way. This will be a 95-yard return for an mlk touchdown, fourth consecutive victory for mlk. Yes! Yeah, young bull! Lead it, baby! Lead it, baby! Let's go. Announcer: Walker is back. He's looking to throw. The cougars are heading to the playoffs. Dunn: I told y'all today it was dinner time. I told y'all today it was dinner time. We've been hungry for a long time. Guess what? We still hungry. We go humble and hungry. H-u-m-b-l-e... Coach, what happened to the field? Why didn't you tell me? I'd have bought you some sod out here or something, huh? Dunn: Break it down. Your families have seen success in you this year. They've never experienced before. You're a much better team than what you were when I was at that first game and you lost to gratz. So it's been in you all along. It's been in you all along. I played for germantown in 1975. Germantown had history, 99 years of history. Everything comes to an end. So take this end and make it your beginning. Germantown-king, it sends a message that we're successful. This means a lot to me. It means a lot to the school district of philadelhia. It means a lot to the rest of the nation as they watch what you're doing this year. Woman: Let me say this loud and clear. When our children are failed, we all suffer. We can't keep settling for this. We can't do it. We've suffered enough in Philadelphia. Hite: My vision for the district was not to close schools. My vision, quite simply, is that all students need to be achieving, regardless of economic background, family circumstances, or zip code. Next speaker is Michelle grace. My name is Michelle grace. I'm a graduate of germantown high school. In addition to being a student of germantown high school, I was one of the student athletes. I played on the football team, and I went all-public, and I was the first girl in the city to carry the ball. Now I am the assistant coach for my rivals Martin Luther King Jr. High school, for the cougars. For the players themselves, their biggest fear wasn't even the rivalry. It was having football taken away because when the doomsday budget was announced, we didn't have football. We didn't have sports, period, and we had to make a decision as a coaching staff to have practice, anyway. Not just Martin Luther King, but every other school who has a football team or who has athletic departments, without football, without basketball, without softball or baseball, these students have no reason to go to school. They have no reason to behave or to pay attention. Being a student athlete made me a student, made me who I was, and now I'm about to get my degree, and I can't say the same for people who didn't have the motivation I had. It needs to be a priority. Man: Some of the money Philly school leaders have been begging for is on its way. And it will bring 400 teachers back into the school system. Woman: It will also fund music and athletic programs for the year. Wade: Congratulations, man. Good news? Good news. You're back. Great, great, great, great. You're back, man. Just got the confirmation from downtown. I'm glad you stayed with us throughout this whole process. Girl on P.A.: Good morning, everybody. It's another wonderful day at the promise academy. Students, in the morning when getting ready for school, please remember our uniform policy, which is tan pants and your grade-colored t-shirts. These pants are too tight. My pants too tight? Girl on P.A.: Now we will begin our interview with head coach coach Dunn. How are you today, coach Dunn? I'm going great, doing great. So tell me about yourself. This was my neighborhood school growing up. I started playing football in high school. I loved playing football, but more importantly, I know the impact my coaches had on me growing into a young man, and I wanted to give back and give that experience to other young men. Mm-hmm. Thank you so much coach Dunn, for coming down and having this interview with us, and I hope you have a nice day. Remember, staff and students, everything we do here at king is aligned with student success. So set the example, and don't be made an example. Have a great day, guys. Good job. You're pretty good at that, huh? Rob: Just want to do a prayer. Be with us, dear god. Protect us, dear god, and guide us, dear lord. Protect sal through this situation, father god. We praise your name, father god. We love you. We honor your name. Amen, father, amen. Rob, voice-over: We believe in our kid. He's innocent. It hurts us to see him in this situation. Woman, voice-over: We're hoping that all of this is actually thrown out. He was just in the wrong place at the wrong time. He wants to come home. He wants to go to school. Both: He wants to play football. Hi. Glad you're home, sal. Can I give him a hug? Man: Absolutely. He's gonna be all yours in a minute. Ok. You have a probation officer, right? Yvette: He'll stay in the house? At all times unless he's scheduled to go outside. Ok. Wade: So you're here now, and you are way behind. You are not to let anybody distract from why you're really here. We're gonna put him on a pathway for success. Great. If he stays on it... great. It's up to him. It's up to him. He has to come up and start making gains right now, ok? We're gonna occupy most of his day. Teacher: When it's quiet, guys, we can start reading. "Is he to be buried in a Christian burial "where she willfully seeks her own salvation? How can that be unless she"... what's that word? "Drowned her... drowned herself in her own defense. I must be"... hey, miss? What's that word, miss? Teacher: "Se offendo." "Se offendo." Yo, I'm not reading any more because I'm not dealing with this, yo. Like real shit, yo. It's gonna be like this the whole time. Teacher: Dontae, what do you want to do? I'm not reading no more, man. I'm done. Teacher: Who wants to take over as first clown? Student: Me. Teacher: Ok, he was saying... ok. It must be "se offendo." It cannot be... Cottle: So... so let me tell you what happened with Florida, ok? Let me tell you what really happened. When his grades for the first semester came out, they said that's enough. They said that's it. That's enough. Wade: Take your hat off, Dontae Angus, and put that phone up. He knows better. Give it to me. Wade: Did you see his progress report? Mother: No. Wade: University of Florida is off the table. He's been absent 16 days from first period, and he is consistently late for class. Fails to seek help. Has missed tests and is in danger of failing. He cannot fail another course. We're gonna get in a position where we're gonna be hoping and wishing for miracles for Dontae. He's going to back himself in a corner, and he's not gonna be able to even graduate if he doesn't step it up right now. You're not meeting anyone halfway, Dontae. You're not doing what you're supposed to do. Dunn: Run it out. Assistant coach: Come on. Cottle: You're wasting time, Dontae. Get your helmet, your shoulder pads, and get on the hill! Assistant coach: What you guys learn from is practicing hills. Everyone from defense messed up, everyone has to pay. They don't need me for defense. Dunn: When you do stuff like give half effort, you talk back, you know, you're letting your teammates down. You got to make a decision whether you gonna be a part of this team or not. Because I know you want to play football, but I'm not sure if you want to be a part of this team. Dunn: You're not blocking anything! That's not blocking! Get in the huddle. Come on, Dontae. You're not blocking him. You got to play more physical. Play more physical! Get him down! See you tomorrow. Go home. Good-bye. I'll see you tomorrow. Peace. Put your stuff up. Oh, shit, man. They don't know what I'm going through, and they won't never understand. Might as well give it up. Give what up? I'm giving nothing up. Ok, well stop complaining. What you mean, "stop com..." there you... yo, I'm out. I'm not gonna sit here and argue. Talk about, "give it up, man"? I don't give up. You're not listening. Do you give up when you put your mind to something? No, but what I'm saying to you... Why you telling me to give up? How you sound? Calm down. I'm not telling you to give up on your dream. Make it happen, despite of all that's going on. They know how I am. Just piss me off. Well, sometimes bite your tongue and do what you're... I'm not biting my tongue. No, you're not listening. Sometimes just keep your trap shut, you understand? Push yourself to get where you have to go. It starts here in high school. Wade on P.A.: 10 seconds to get to class. 10 seconds to get to class. If you are caught in the hallway between period, you will be documented, and interventions will be put in place for those of you that cannot get to class on time. If you do not want to be involved in this process, get to class on time. Woman: Yeah. Good morning. I mean, good afternoon. Miss whittaker. Hi, miss whittaker. Oh, yes, you have until 7:00, ok? So today I can go to practice? Yes. Ok. Whittaker: But do not, repeat, do not be late. They have a zero tolerance policy, and I'm not here to save you. Ok. You're a minute late, you might be arrested. Thank you. All right. All right, bye. That's all! Teacher: Pull your pants up, son. I get to practice today. I'm putting my, look, my pants like this. I'm gonna hold the loop. Get a belt. You don't got to pull it over. That's cool. Dunn: Come on, yo. Hurry up. Welcome back. Assistant coach: All right, let's welcome sal back. Set. Hut. Assistant coach: Good work, sal. Dunn: Washington right 331. Washington right 331, 802. Sal on "y," right? Is speedy in for sal? Dunn: Sal is at the "z." Speedy is at the "y." Yeah. That's where I come like this, right? Set, hut. Player: Oh, my god. What the fuck? Dunn: Back up, back up. You don't need to see. Back up. Sal. Sal, sal? Sal? Assistant coach: Give him a minute. Give him a minute. Turn his head to the side. Sal? He's got to get some air. There you go. Ha ha ha! Get that mouthpiece out of his mouth. Welcome back, baby. Breathe, sal. You all right. Breathe. Just breathe, sal. In through the nose, out through the mouth. Just breathe. Stay still. Stay still. Don't move. You're all right, sal. Take your time. Sal: Oh, shit. Yeah, "oh, shit." You know what happened? No, ma'am. You don't know what happened? I just scored. Assistant coach: That's right. Touchdown, baby. All right, relax. Just relax. He just said he blacked out. He doesn't have any neck pain, right? No neck pain? Grace: No. Are you dizzy? Can you stand up? Yeah, he's dizzy. Ok. I'll bring him to the hospital. Help him get to his stuff. Help him get to his stuff, y'all. Why was he going full contact a day before a game? Shouldn't let this happen, yo. When you're doing full contact, yo... We wasn't going full contact. Especially in practice, yo. Yo, we wasn't going full contact. Fucking can't let things like this happen, yo. You're tripping. Dunn: Dontae, come here. Bring Dontae here. Assistant coach: I got him. I got it. No, no, bring him here. Dontae, come here. Everybody's upset. Calm down. Calm down. Sal's all right. Just calm down. It don't matter, yo. This could happen to anybody, yo. You're right. It can. Any day, every day, first to play the game, last to play the game. It don't matter. It shouldn't happen in no fucking practice neither, man. Calm down. It's practice, yo. You're right. Made a mistake and hit him, man. That's what happens. It happens. Dunn: All right, y'all. Pick your heads up. Pick your heads up. This is nothing new to us, you know, having our backs against the wall. Since September 1, our backs been against the wall, so it's nothing new. What we're gonna do is we're gonna rally, we're gonna step up, pull each other up. It's time to rally. All we got is us. Hey, sharrif. You're in Philly this weekend, right? Ok. Um, one of my boys, I don't know if you remember Dontae. You are his idol, and he's just having a really tough time. Like you know, he's been like, he's been acting out in school, he's been acting up on the field, like things just haven't been going well for him. If I can get you to even have a conversation with him... So, what do you think? Wow. This is crazy. I need me a house like this. Grace: Dontae. Angus: Yo. Come here. Sweet. Ah... What do you say, man? How everything going? Angus: There's all this pressure on me. All this pressure. Everybody's saying it's up to me to qualify, but I got two folders full of work I got to do for both class... Like English and pre calc. When it came to ball, I knew it was one thing that was gonna keep me from playing the sport, and that was my grades. Get it done, man. Stress. I blocked that out. I ain't got no time for that. Affect the game. No matter what's going on. Just step back away from the team and look at your boys. How do you affect them? How does your attitude carry over into the team? You're their leader, so when they see you bitching, they're gonna start bitching, and when they see you giving it all, they gonna give it all right with you. Going in there with a mindset of already being stressed and already feeling like you got a lot on your shoulders, you're gonna be right back in Philly. You don't want to be like everybody else in the hood that didn't make it and come home saying "yeah", "I coulda did this, I coulda did that, only if I would have did this." No. Start with you. Put your head down and grind. That's all you got to do, and they all will respect you. All right. All right. Just seeing him, my role model, it's just motivation. I want to get where he's at. I want to play against him one day. That's gonna happen. I'm gonna play against sharrif Floyd. Announcer: All right. High school football, the public league semi-finals.

"The cougars have now won 9 straight "since losing to mastery north "back in September 6. "It truly depends on what they do "up front in the trenches. Dontae Angus needs to have the game of his life." It's all about the line, though. If our line competes, we gonna win this game.

Dunn: We got the news that sal's medically been cleared to play. Obviously, he brings a lot to the table. We're gonna need all the help that we can get to pull off a victory this weekend. Right in the bucket. Sal: People always wondering why I put so much in football, you know. It's like, "football's not gonna do nothing for you." I have a football team. I want to be a part of every team, be a part of the family. Angus: This is a championship game. My first championship. I've never been to championship. My first. I'm going 1,000% because I want this jacket. I want this ring. When I, when I finish high school, I want to leave with a jacket knowing that I won something. I did something. For me to come from germantown and then join with the enemy and make the enemy family, it feel good. I had a great year. I love all y'all. I want to apologize for all the stuff I put y'all through this season. I'm gonna miss all y'all. Man: We had to prove a lot of people wrong this year. No one expected us to win. Let's make winning a new tradition around here at king. Dunn: It's been a long season. There's been a lot of practices. I know you're tired. I know you're fatigued. This is not the time to get tired. This is the time that you got to suck it up. Y'all got to turn up. Can't nobody play this game for y'all. Stakes don't get no higher than the championship. Stakes don't get no higher than this.

They're expecting us to fall. Who cares? When they knock you down, you get up and you ask for some more. Y'all want to know why I coach the way I coach y'all? For games like this. That's why we practice in the snow. That's why we practice in the rain. That's why we practice in 20-degree weather. Humility. Not only playing for yourself, but playing for the man right next to you. Sacrificing for the man next to you. That's brotherhood. This is the game. It ain't nothing to save it for. It ain't nothing to save it for. Leave every single thing out there. It's the opportunity to show the world who we are. Show the city who we are. Show them what we do as king.

Dunn: I keep telling people we've got the toughest bunch of kids in the city. They proved it again today. We've got the toughest kids in the city. All we got to do is cultivate them. They've got so much potential. You think you've seen something on that football field? Watch the next 20 years of these kids' lives. I'm gonna be a part of every single one of their lives as long as I've got breath in my lungs. When we get a new set next year, we're gonna grow them up, too. That's what we're gonna do. It's one way... You get from where we started to where we are right now. It's one formula. It's been one formula since day one. Y'all been there with me since day one. Y'all my little brothers forever, for life. I love every single one of you all. It's one formula. All you got to do is start and stay humble. You got to stay hungry.

"U"... Down. "M"... Down. "B"... Down. "I"... Down. "E"... Down. "A"... Down. "N"... Down. "D"... Down. "H"... Down. "U"... Down. "N"... Down. Down. Down. Cottle: He might be our quarterback next year. He might be safety. He might be our number-one receiver. He might be a lot of things. He's not a division 2 player. He's a 1aa. He's a 1aa football player. White: We'd take him in a heartbeat. I'll be in touch. Damn. What? What? That just said "end of lesson." Please move on to the test." Come in a little closer. Right there. There's talk of having to eliminate sports. Kids wouldn't paint their face, they wouldn't participate in spirit week when I first took over. This week they were buzzing at 7:30. Face painting, school colors. It was pride. I am saying that. It brought a tear to my eye. Girl: Quick announcement. After 9:15 today, there will be no more purchases for the pep rally tickets. We all need to be there, show support, turn up, have your colors on, have your little flags on, have your... Whatever y'all need to do. Turn up for this because... you already know... They did it. Let's turn up, y'all. Bang bang, cougar gang. So have a great day and set the example, don't be made an example. Bye, y'all. Man: And now your Martin Luther king 2014 football team. Dunn: Come on. Let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go. Come on. Man: The city of Philadelphia wants to give us something. "By accepting the challenges presented by "political circumstances beyond their control, "we hereby recognize and honor the Martin Luther King high school football team." This is the culmination of work that we've not only been doing over the last couple months, but for a lot of these young men, for years. Man: And now we have 9 young men that are gonna be signing letters of intent. I'll be attending shippensburg university. Cheyney university. I'm going to alderson broaddus university to play football. Playing college football at bloomsburg university. My name is Joseph Walker. I'll be attending university of Delaware.
