Yes? Do you want Mum? Mum? Yes, love? Jeanie, get inside. Just let me talk to her. You can't do this to me. She's my daughter. Just a minute. She don't know you, George. And she don't wanna know you. I don't wanna fucking know you. You can't do this to me. I only come to see her. You can't do this to me! I'm sorry, love. I'm sorry. Get out. You cow! I only came to say hello. Hello! Fuck off. Charming. Fuck off! You gonna clean all that up? Come on, mate. Oi, hey, hey, take it easy, boy, okay? Hey. Just let him be, right? The man's upset. Okay? That's the right word, George, eh? Upset. So, where'd they all come from? They live here. Since when? Since you went inside. Jesus. Did you get my last book? Yeah, yeah. Shouldn't have been the driver though. Who should it have been then? I could pin him in the first chapter. Who should it have been then? The Chinese fella who fed the goldfish. You didn't write it, George. No, no, I didn't, but if I had- Christ! You kept it. Aye, kept it for you. You keep it tuned? Why does she hate me, Thomas? She doesn't. Yes, she does. You can never tell with women, George. They're different. They wear skirts and like to powder their noses, and when they go to heaven, they get wings. Like angels? Aye, like angels. Yeah, but angels are men, Thomas. Men? Yes. No one told me that. It's true. Angels are men. You got a big white rabbit with long floppy ears? No, but we have one with short ears. What's his name? His name is Arthur. He's over here. Oh, right. He'll do, yeah. What is this, George? It's a rabbit. You're not gonna start all that business again, are you? Eh? Yeah, why not? Look, George, you can't go in there. Why not? It's different. What, Mortwell, is he different, too? Very different. Ah, we'll see. Come on, George, you're not going in there. I've done seven years for him, Thomas! Listen, George, you don't know what they are up to now. I don't give a fuck. Give us the rabbit. No, listen, oi, what do you want it for? I'm gonna give it to him. Well, it's up to you. We're closed. Tell him, Terry. Yeah, we're closed, sir. Hiya, Terry. He'll have a lettuce and I'll have a Bloody Mary. George? That's right, and this is Arthur. What you doing here? Looking for Mortwell, Terry. Bit of work, you know. What do you do now? Whatever comes up. Yeah, but this is a knocking shop. Leave it out, George. So, where is he? Mortwell? He's not around. Well, he must be somewhere. Better ask Dudley, George. Through there? Expecting me? Knew I was out? I suspected it, George. So, where is he? Where's who? Mortwell. He's away, George. South of France. He owes me, Dudley. He said he'd look after me. He said a lot of things, George. Next time you see him, give him that! Oi, George, George. Come on. Look, we need a driver. I'm a driver. Do you know what a bleeper is? I can't understand it, how's that little thing it's supposed to go bleep wherever I am? Well, it bounces off the Post Office tower, George. Miracle of modern technology. Yeah, but it hasn't got an aerial or nothing. Ah, it doesn't need one. Look, I'll show you, right? What's that? Is that going? No, no, that's a tester to see it's making a noise. Don't muck about with it, for Christ sake. You've been pulling that bleeding knob. I bet you've buggered it. What do you think? What do you do, melt it down and eat it? No, they're ornamental, George. Ornamental spaghetti? Aye. I reckon it'll go a bomb. Where did you get it? Contacts, George. Can't find plastic spaghetti just anywhere. Nah. I don't suppose too many people make it, do they? Aye. Well, the Japanese cornered the market. You fancy a fiberglass fruit flan? Or a polystyrene tutti-frutti? Fancy a cup of tea? What's it made of? Leaves! Paging Mr. Carrington. Where's the bar? Take a seat, sir, and I'll take your order. Paging Mr. Carrington. Thank you, sir. You doing business? Darling, sorry I kept you. What do you think this is, the honeymoon hotel? Look, do you have business in this hotel or can I really help you? Where's your car? Over there. Pretend you know me, would you? I don't know you, do I? Pretend you fucking well do. Not the back, the front. So, where did they get you from? Under a cabbage leaf. I have to work these places. The bar boy turns a blind eye but the manager doesn't. Are you gonna tell me where you wanna go? The Lambert. Sorry. Didn't they tell you that? You're meant to be my date not my minicab driver. What does your date do? He looks after me, you dingbat. He's meant to want to see me. And what if he don't? He pretends. How do you pretend? Christ, who sent you? Does it matter? You're the tom, darlin'. Just shut up and drive, would you? Oh, can I have a large Bloody Mary? I'm sitting here, all right? Here, did you hear me? Are you serving here or just wearing in a new pair of shoes? Oi! Do you want a drink? They don't seem to serve you here. I've done it wrong again, ain't I? Okay, I got it wrong. That's all. What did you expect? I'm not used to working in piss holes like this. That was quick. You were asleep. Was I? How was he? I beg your pardon? How was the Arab? None of your business. Oh, all right. Where to? Kings Cross. You want a chocolate sandwich? Bit down market, ain't it? Shut up. Drive on, please. And now? You leave me here. Goodnight then. You'll have to get yourself some clothes. Why will I have to get meself some clothes? If you're to drive me. Here, use this. I'm not having you paying me. Why not? You don't even like me. I can claim it. Goodnight. Is this real? Aye, of course. A present for you. Right. Is it good? It's brilliant. Yeah? Aye. Somebody's murdering opera singers, right? Yeah. And after every murder, they leave a Percheron. What's a Percheron? Kind of horse. You mean like a white horse that pulls a milk cart? Aye, that kind of thing. Oh, right. And? Well, then it gets complicated. Might just spoil it for you. Oh. Christ. What do you think? Jesus. You don't like them? Do you? Well, I bought them, didn't I? You bought them? All right. Oh fuck, here, here's your change. Not here, for Jesus sake. You're as much cover as a pair of fishnet tights. I may as well be wearing a sign around my neck. Oh, all you're missing is the gold medallion. Don't like them, either? Fucking hate them. Right. See, I'm cheap. I can't help it. God made me that way. Being cheap is one thing, looking cheap is another. That really takes talent. Some woman are whores, some whores are black. You take what you're given, don't ya? I didn't ask to drive you around. I was given you, same as you was given me. The only difference is, you complain and I don't! Turn it off! You heard me, turn it off. Look, you ask me to buy clothes, I buy 'em. But you make remarks. Did anybody ever teach you manners? Do you wanna work for me? No. Get out. Get the fucking out, lady.

Oh, thank you, thanks a lot. Ta ra. See ya. He took his time. What, did he fall asleep half way through? Well, you never know with these darkies, do you? I'm sorry. Well, I told you I was cheap, didn't I? Very. Much obliged. Where to now? Kings Cross. Back to the meat rack. Your wish is my command. Jesus, they're so young. Here, tell me something. What? Do they ever want you back? Who? Your clients. Always. What, they-they fall-fall in love with you? Well, do they? Sometimes they fall for what they think I am. What do they think you are?

He ran the two of us. She was younger than me. Beautiful. She had a habit, and that's why I stayed. One day I couldn't take it any longer. I met a man with a gold ring who took me to Brighton. When I woke up, he was gone. I didn't mind. Saw the sea outside. Met another on the pier and that paid the hotel bill. Stayed the whole summer. Even managed to save. I came back to London. Met the man with the gold ring again. Learned about the West End hotels then and a different world. I took a taxi round that street looking for Cath, but she was gone. If you last a year and a half on that street, you're lucky. I was lucky. I got out. Cathy, her name is Cathy. She's a Londoner. She has a tattoo on her hand, there. I promised I would look after her.
