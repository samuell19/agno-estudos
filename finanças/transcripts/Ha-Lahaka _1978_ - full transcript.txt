So what do you care? Look, that they sit and sing all night, is their problem, I don't want to get involved; it's not important what I think it does to the atmosphere of the band and to the name of the girls on the whole base, But that afterwards they get solos that they shouldn't,,, That's really disgusting, -You know what bothers me? Today she took your solo, and tomorrow she'll take Molly's, Molly, you'll say something if you don't want to be made a sucker by this whole thing, -What, it's not right? If they're not deserving of it, it's really annoying, -Anyway, with the way she's acting there's no way she'll be staying, Yafa, if you,,, -Shut up!

Dry her off, Bring her a towel, He's insane! He's not in shock, he's completely off the wall! Shut up! -Take him away! -What are you doing? Get him out of here! Do me a favor, get him out of here! He's completely lost his marbles, what are you doing? Take this, please, -But I don't need,,, So you think there's something between Dotner and Bazooka? They say that they hold hands before the show, Do you think it's serious? -I mean, do their parents know? They haven't told the parents, -Molly, when you grow up,,, I also heard that people will be getting booted, -Really booted, The food in the army is disgusting, My girlfriend can never understand why my stomach hurts, The coffee's gone, Doron, can you bring coffee? Ours is finished, -No problem, What are you doing? This coffee is really good, It's even better than what my girlfriend makes, Someone wants coffee? Dotner? Thanks, Dotner, -What? What happened? -Nothing, Good morning, dear invaders, Excuse me, where's the bathroom here? -What? -Toilets, bathroom, In the pavilion over there, Where are you running? -I'm going to the bathroom, I'll show you what a toilet is in the middle of a show, Five pound fine for each of you, and I'm having you court martialed again, Go get changed, But I have diarrhea,,, -I don't care, go get changed! Maybe right now there's someone from the TV in the audience who's deciding to take us or the tanks' band, And these degenerates want a toilet! "When the Bilu came all full of hope, "And settled together the land of our ancestors, "They were ill with malaria, "they suffered from the heat, "But something whispered in their hearts, "lf it's good or if it's bad, "there's no turning back, "there's no turning back, "lf it's good or if it's bad, "there's no turning back, "there's no turning back, "They rode horses with swords and staffs, "to banish any conspirator or intended killer, "ln Rehovot and Gedera "Petach Tikvah and Hadera "They called Palestine, lsrael, "lf it's good or if it's bad, "There's no turning back, "There's no turning back, "lf it's good or if it's bad, "there's no turning back, "There's no turning back,,," What pisses me off is that he only gave them a 5 pound fine, They deserve it, -You should have seen how they ran off the stage, By the way, were Dotner and Bazooka in bed when you got up? No, they weren't in bed when I got up, Do you think they finally got the idea? What's that? -Do you think they finally got the hint? What you can't get through your head, you get through your ass, They had a night full of cans, filling cans with their shit, Outstanding, Oh, man, Mother! Hey, they're totally insane! What should we do, Moni? -I don't know, we need to think, We can't lose our composure, We gotta take them down, -We can't touch them! It's forbidden to touch, Run and call Moti, before someone comes and lays a towel on them, Do you think they'll blame us? -Don't think about it now, go get Moti already! -Moti! -Get going! Idiot! -Moti! Moti! What happened? We didn't think it would happen, What did you do, idiots? -lt wasn't in the plans, we,,, What's wrong with you? Have you gone insane? Why are we to blame?

What a joke they pulled on us, They're crazy,,, Talking about free love, with our situation in lsrael, it doesn't help anything, because our men are dying every day at the Suez Canal, It's irrelevant at this point, -Look, the world is divided between crazies and those who are even more crazy, -Voice of lsrael broadcasting from Jerusalem, the time is 6, and for the news: On Mt, Herzel the preparations are being completed for the national Memorial Day ceremony that will begin in about an hour, Throughout the country stages are up for shows and folk dancing "Carnival, in the 'Nahal' it's a carnival, "Whoever misses it, loses out "Whoever misses it, loses out "The valley and the mountain, the savanna and the desert, "Everyone's sharp everyone's pretty, "everyone joins in, "So come on, y'all "Do your souls a favor, "ski down from the mountains, "to be drunk like us "Carnival "Carnival in the 'Nahal', Carnival "Whoever misses it loses out, "Whoever misses it,,, "Loses out!"

Wow, look what we have here, The army has begun to place people according to their talents, Say, Moni, you don't think that it's dangerous to leave him with two such military cakes? -Excuse me, waiter, could you bring something else? Do you mind if I put these cakes on the table? Doron, do you mind? -Do you mean in practical terms do I mind, or theoretically do I mind? I'm trying to understand the meaning of your question, It's a question of concept, because actually,,, -Hello, Micki Fuck you,,, -Fuck it all, bastard! Why are you throwing cake? What an idiot, a real low-life! Retard! -Screw you, you slut, I'll show you how to piss! Why are you throwing cake? Whoever accepted you to the band is an idiot, you piece of shit! What's going on here? Fuck'n jerk! Psycho! Throwing cakes! Molly, Bazooka, you frightened me, Why are you walking like that? Are you nuts? I forgot my shirt, Do you want my jacket? -No, it's okay, I'm not cold, Let's help you look for it, Are you waiting for someone? -Yes, You're not going home? Where do you live? -I'm from Sharim, but I'm almost never there, I mean most of my sisters live there, but l,,, I'm always in Tel Aviv, -At Sari's? -At Sari's, I saw her driving off with some guy a few hours ago, It couldn't be, she'll be back any time now, Why are you putting her down? She's not that kind of girl, I'm not putting her down, lf you're sure she'll be back, fine, Yes, she,,, but of course I'm sure, Sari & I are best friends, just like family, Does she think the same as you do? Wait, what are you trying to say? That a girl like her couldn't be a friend of mine? Why do you say "a girl like me"? I think you are much prettier and much more talented than her, What are you,,, really,,, you're just,,, you don't know anything, Maybe I don't understand, but I know when one girl is jealous of another, I'm jealous of Sari? -Exactly the opposite, Sari's jealous of me? Now you've really gone overboard, and talk like a blind man, No just throwing out words, I don't understand,,, I don't understand you at all, -lt could be, Doesn't matter, Do want to go to the city-officer? Of course not! I was just telling you that Sari should be back, We arranged it that l'd come to sleep at her house, Good night, What do you know about anything? I remember that I saw you last year on TV, My whole class sent cards to The Hit Parade after the broadcast, Tell me, how is it that you sing most of the solos in the program? I don't know, I didn't ask for it, They gave them to me, and in the army you do as you're told, And what about Micki and Yafa? I have something here! Micki and Yafa wouldn't care? What about them? What do you care? Who are they? Liecht knows what he's doing, The important thing is who sings the best, No games, It's a fact, he let you sing "Shalva", and you,,, And you've barely been here, Sometimes I'm not sure I deserve it, The girls talk,,, Of course you deserve it, You can see the song works, right? Do you think there's a chance that I'll ever get,,, another song to sing, so they won't say that it was only chance? Sure, you deserve to, It just takes time, -You,,, Do you think we'll sing together? You're getting out at the end of this program, right? And that means that we need to arrange for you,,, to sing with me in this program, is that what you're saying? No, I wasn't saying anything, But that's what you meant, Everybody's free to dream, I live here, on the second street, Would you like to come up? Do you live with your parents? Micki? -Yes, I love you, -Really, just like that? Yes, just like that, Is that okay? -What's okay? I don't know, I don't have a lot of experience with these things, I'm also not exactly an expert in the matter, In these kinds of circumstances you need to bring guide books, Now I believe according to all the books, we,,, need to kiss, no? -Yes, that's what's usually done, -Right? So,,, What ever will be, will be, Let's go in the water, -Why? Do I look dirty? No, you're just insane, Are you coming? I'm not sure it's what I want to do now, Molly! Molly, wait a minute! Where were you yesterday evening? -I wasn't anywhere, I went to sleep at the city-officer's, -But why there? I thought you were coming to my house, -I waited, doesn't matter, But Molly, I waited for you and we left a key, It's okay, don't worry, Good morning, -Good morning, Good morning, How's it going? How was it? No, really! Moni, where's Micki? -Moti, where's Micki? Wow, you were fantastic, really great, -Thank you, Here they come, what's the panic? Good morning, They were together, What's this look? Back from the ocean? -Yes, Sit down, Change your uniform at the first chance you have, You look like hippies, Okay, How are you? Sit down, Friends, get a hold of yourselves, and I'm saying this for the last time: I've had it with the tardiness and the lack of order, Don't force me to act like a commander in basic training, because I know how it's done, Now pay attention: next Monday the television is doing a live broadcast of our show, What a bitch, that Aviv, Why didn't he tell me? Friends, the whole country will be watching us, and we're just a simple band, Get a hold of yourselves, go on, Okay, guys, I have a short announcement: Dani and I have decided together with Avi and Leicht to take the second stanza in "Red Dress", and give it to Noa, We'll do it like that tonight, Surprise! -Are you insane? Tell me, have you both lost it? Why do you tell us in the middle of the show? Because at another time we wouldn't agree? Moti, the girl signed on for four months for that solo; do you know what you're doing to her with this? -Friends, it's for the good of the program, -For the good of who? It's for the good of the program, The song's not strong enough now, And Noa,,, the audience loves Noa from "Shalva" You took "Shalva" from me, too, "Shalva" was my solo, Nobody took anything from you, The positions are remaining the same, There are no other changes except that Noa is singing the second stanza, Action on stage I'm not going on stage, -You're going on stage and that's an order I'm not going on stage, and I'll go all the way with this, just so you know, I'm sick of you! Just tell me, do you want to ruin the program for the television? You're going on stage now! -Okay, we'll go on now, We'll go on now, but this is not the end, just wait and see, Come on, What nerve, and she's Moti's girlfriend, how else would she get all these solos? I knew this would happen, Yafchu, careful, in the end you won't have any solos, Don't touch me! -Sorry, didn't mean to touch you, Do you need any help in your public battle? "ln a red dress and two braids "A little naive girl stood all alone and asked "why?" "And all the volcanoes and all the storms "Stood in rage and couldn't find the answer, "Stood in rage and couldn't find the answer, "The animals stopped, "A little naive girl stood all alone "And asked "why?" Are you okay? Go on, go on with the song, I've had enough of this shit, That's what's going on now, Cut out all the crap, -Why don't you just shut your trap! You can shut up, Dani, you're the last one to be talking! Why are you even opening your mouth? -Who are you to butt in? Piece of shit! -Shut up, fuck'n bitch! Shut up! What do you know about anything? Nothing! But, Yafa, nobody's been taking solo's from me one after the other Have you noticed the atmosphere in the band with that little slut? How can you call Noa a little slut? Bazooka, sometimes your questions are too much, What's your story? He's right, What's wrong with you, Only you, Yafa, and Molly deserve to get solos, Another one who gets it? What's the connection? -What's with you? Yafa signed on for an extra four months for this, did you know? Really, what difference does it make? What does it have to do with four months? Is this health insurance? Noa is talented and has a pretty voice, so it's great that she'll be singing, What do you want? Dotner, you're new, and a little wretched,,, Now don't involve the new, small and wretched into it, Calm down, Keep your mouth shut and say thanks that you're here, Halt! The honorable judge! Your name? -Zaku, -I had a good impression, -Honorable judge, Bring in the witnesses, -Let's go, Attention! Tell me, soldier! -At ease, You said that your name is Zaku, Zaku is what you're called? Your name is Brasso! Please return to the issue at hand, -One moment, This is an issue of a police trial! So you said Brasso? Brasso? There's an issue with the police! Court! -Just like it was in the court, so I said,,, I got annoyed, and I said to him: "Eat it"! He didn't eat it, and l,,, so I took it, and he did like this in my face, The defendant, I accuse you of disruption of the court proceedings! You'll pay for this,,, very high fines! So why don't you forget about her? It's impossible after a year and a half, you know,,, She's also used to me, and l,,, The truth is that I pity her, That's the whole thing, I think you just got stuck with her, Really, simply stuck with her, I don't know how I can help you on this, She pisses me off so much sometimes, Tell me, is it true that the guys in the band fuck from behind? Real gays? What do you want? Look at them all, what ladies, really,,, Moti, Moti, I think I see someone in the bus, Where? Who? Maybe it's thieves stealing the instruments, maybe replacing equipment or something, Wait here, I'm going to rip their bones apart, Dani, not here, -Stop it, stop it,,, We'll be seen, -Everyone's in the dining room, what's with you? Don't shoot, commander, I surrender, It's not fair, It's not fair, Dani, it's not fair! That's prostitution! Forget it, Moti, it's nothing, it's not,,, It's not serious,,,for fun, For fun? Just for fun? I'll show you fun! It's not just for fun! Come here! Cut it out! That's enough! Stop it already, Dani, Moti! Stop it! Cut it out! Enough! It's enough already! That's enough, stop it!

They're all out of key! Aviv, may I go to the bathroom for a second? -No, Just for a second, -Don't want to hear a word, You'll be hearing from me after you hear from Alron, what he has to say about this fiasco, Okay, band, in another 72 hours you're being filmed by the TV, A cancellation would cause us considerable embarrassment, so in the next 72 hours Aviv will work your butts off, and will make you into an army band, If you don't make it to the required levels, the show will be cancelled and the band members dispersed, clear? To work, -Within 40 seconds everyone is at rehearsals, Gentlemen, get a move on, or does someone want to find himself back at the induction center today? Micki, do you need a special invitation? "But the birds are loyal to their silence, "And with the coming of Fall "They fly off with a flap of their wings "And their secrets with them,,," Okay, not bad, Not good,,, But not so bad, Okay, enough of this for today, we'll continue tomorrow, Now Leicht will teach you the voices for the new song, Leicht, What? -You're insane, -Leicht, Are you crazy? You're nuts! What's this? -Who does he think he is? -We've been at it for 14 hours What's going on? -Quiet! Tell me, Moti, are you the commander of a band or just a rag? Listen: "My Doron, I love you, "and I'm not embarrassed to write it, quite the opposite, "Yours with hot kisses, Anat," How's that? -Great, Okay, guys, Iights out, Leave the lights! I'll turn the lights out, If you touch the electricity, I'll smack your face, Smack my face, you're doing good with me, commander! Maybe it's enough?

Can't hear you, Do you want to be sent on holiday? Do you need to be hooked up to an oxygen tank? What's going on? Gentlemen, you're moving like at the retirees' ball, So get moving like you know how, or we'll close up shop! From the beginning, "Carnival, in the 'Nahal' Carnival,,," He's really gone overboard, What does he think, we're windup toys? Micki, shut up and start singing! "Whoever misses it, loses out" Giora, -What? Are you angry with me? -Why should I be angry with you? I don't know, maybe I'm to blame for all the fighting, A pity that you and Micki aren't,,, -It's not a pity, Forget it, Bazooka, you're not guilty, and Noa's not to blame, nobody is, It's just all those idiots with all their crap!

Dotner, cut with this family crap of yours, and jump on the stage! -You can jump on the stage! He's right, you can't just kick people out, Get out of my sight, both of you, -I'm with them in the same family, Wait, I'm coming to fly with you, -Dani, this is the end for you, the end of your career, I'll burn you in the civilian market, Burn all you like, have a big bonfire, What's going on here?

You saw for yourself, bums! Bums or not, it means that we weren't successful in getting the show off the ground, The television cancellation is on our heads, the fiasco is ours, and we're carrying all the weight, so let's think for a sec, What do you suggest? -To wait, How can we wait? Tomorrow is the show, Maybe it'll work out by then, -What'll work out? You saw them? A bunch of trouble makers, -Yes, but give them some time to stew in their own juices, and they'll calm down, No love lost between them all, They'll start taking into consideration their futures, They'll think about the managers and the hit parades, and will calm down and say they're sorry like little tots, So, we,,, don't say a word to Alron? -Nothing, And just wait? -Just wait, Truth or Dare? -Truth, Are you a virgin?
