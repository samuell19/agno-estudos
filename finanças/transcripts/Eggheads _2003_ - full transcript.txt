These people are amongst the greatest quiz players in Britain. Together they make up the Eggheads - arguably the most formidable quiz team in the country. The question is, can they be beaten? Welcome to Eggheads, the show where a team of five quiz Challengers pit their wits against possibly the greatest quiz team in Britain. Here they are, the Eggheads. Hoping to beat the might of the Eggheads today are The Masters of Malt, from Edinburgh. Now, everyone on this team shares a passion for American football and malt whisky. Let's meet them. Hi, I'm Greg, and I'm a disability employment advisor. Hi, I'm Luke, and I'm a software tester. Hi, I'm Mike, and I'm a copywriter. Hi, I'm Steve, and I'm an IT service desk manager. Hi, I'm Graeme, and I'm a primary school teacher. So, Greg and team, hello. Hello. Welcome. Great to see you, and it all seems to revolve around American football, Greg. That's right, yeah. We play in a fantasy football league together, and that takes up quite a large part of our lives. So, do you all have an individual American football team that you support, or is it all the same team, or what? In real life, I suppose, we all support a different team. Detroit Lions, Pittsburgh Steelers, Baltimore Ravens, Tampa Bay Buccaneers, New England Patriots. Oh, well, that's useful stuff for these Eggs, because they come up the whole time, these teams, don't they? You're always trying to sort of get a handle on which football team... So, what, what led you to love American football as opposed to the real thing? I think it's just... LAUGHTER Sorry, Americans! I think it's just such a different game. The tactical side behind it, the amount that you can learn about all the different rules, and it's just so different to any kind of British or European sport, and we've all kind of gravitated towards it. And you have a fantasy league, so you work out players, it works rather like the classic football leagues here, fantasy football leagues, does it? You get points if they play well? Absolutely. So, there's 16 of us in our league, and, yeah. And Masters of Malt, because there's a bit of whisky involved in it as well. Yeah. So, we're all a big fan of whisky, and all of our team names are named after a whisky. Couldn't be clearer. LAUGHTER It just absolutely makes perfect sense. So, I hope you're good at quizzing as well. That's what we're going to find out. Good luck, team. Every day, there is $1,000 worth of cash up for grabs for our Challengers. However, if they fail to defeat the Eggheads, the prize money rolls over to the next show. Masters of Malt, the Eggheads have won the last three games, which means there's $4,000 for you if you win and beat them. And would you like to crack on? Absolutely. OK, the first head-to-head battle is on the subject of sport. Oh, what about that? LAUGHTER That's probably good. So, Luke... I'm going to take it. I'm going to take on... So, you've got either Lisa, Steve, Pat, Kevin or Judith. I'm going to take Kevin. This happened in the last game, Kevin, they went for you straight away. That's right, yeah, yeah. Yeah, teams have come in... They've wised up. They've wised up, coming with a new thing - hurl yourself at Kevin early. Go big or go home. Yeah, that's it. LAUGHTER So, Luke from Masters of Malt is going to go big or go home against Kevin from the Eggheads. To ensure there's no conferring, please go to our famous Question Room. I gather you're quite a one for sport trivia, Luke. Yeah, I'm a big sports fan. NFL, obviously, and Formula 1, but most sports, tennis as well, so, yeah. OK, well, let's see. Sport. Luke has thrown himself at Kevin early, and would you like to go first or second? I'll go first, please, Jeremy. We're all excited here, Luke. Good luck. First round. In cricket, which expression is commonly shouted by the bowler and fielders when they appeal to an umpire for an LBW or a catch? Well, I'm not a big cricket fan, but I do... It's a funny word. I think they shout, "Howzat?" Yes, it would have been awful if you'd come a cropper on that first question after the big build-up. Howzat? is the correct answer, well done. Kevin, Hellas Verona, SPAL and Benevento were all teams promoted to which top-tier football division in 2017? They're all Italian teams. It's Serie A. Serie A is correct. Luke, for which Formula 1 team did Max Verstappen drive in the 2017 season? I should know this one. He drives for Red Bull. Red Bull's correct. Kevin, what name is given to a shot in badminton that is played close to the net and drops down sharply on the other side? Hmm. That's a bit of terminology that's passed me by. Can't really see how boomerang would work. Boomerang, you would tend to think of something that goes a fair distance and then comes back in some way, but it could... I mean, I suppose it could operate if the shuttlecock has originally come from the other side and it's basically just... I, I, I can't really see that. I can't really get anything out of hairpin at all, unless it's to do with the shape. And clothes hanger... What would it be to do with a clothes hanger? I'm just, I'm just going to go for a hairpin on the basis that the shape of a hairpin is a very narrow curve. And so you've got something which would just fall. I don't, I really don't know. OK. I can't work it out. I'll say hairpin. Hairpin is your answer. Let's see, I think you know, Challengers, do you? I think it is hairpin. Hairpin is the right answer, Kevin. OK, Luke, I thought we had him there. Your third question - which horse racing trainer set a new record for top-level wins in a flat season in October 2017? Well, Balding, obviously Clare Balding. But I think that's the jumps. I don't think that's flat. Sir - would he still be a trainer if he was a sir? I don't know. Just in a process of elimination I would go for Aidan O'Brien. You made light work of that. I thought from your expression that horse racing's not your thing. It's not, no. OK, but you're right, Aidan O'Brien's right. Well done, three out of three. Kevin under pressure now. Who was the first boxer to knock down Muhammad Ali in a professional fight? Henry Cooper certainly did it. He knocked him down. Sonny Banks, I don't recognise. Chuck Wepner was a kind of journeyman fighter, sometimes said to be the inspiration for Rocky, who had a go later on. I'll have to go for Henry Cooper. If you've got this wrong, you're out. Well, I should ask you, Luke. I probably would have gone Henry Cooper as well, just because I know he knocked him down, but I don't know either. The answer is Sonny Banks. You're out, Kevin. Yeah. Well done, Luke, you're in the final round. Very, very good strategy. Please come back to us and we'll play round two. Well, well, well, Masters of Malt have started strong, haven't they? Fantasy League players and they're in the fantasy now! You've won the first round, you've knocked out Kevin, well done. You're all still there, the Eggheads have lost one. And the next subject is Arts and Books. Who would like this? We're going to give it to Michael. OK, Mike, our copywriter. Against which Egghead? Any one of them bar Kevin. I think I am going to take Steve. Very good. So, Mike is coming from Masters of Malt to play Steve from the Eggheads. Go to the Question Room, gentlemen, please. Mike, remind us of your favourite American football team? It's the Baltimore Ravens. And how did you decide it was them? I've got friends who live just outside Baltimore. The first time I went over, I was 16 and they took me to a game, erm, and just co-opted me into supporting the team that way. Brilliant. Arts and Books - do you want to go first or second? I will go first, please. Here we go with your question. What gift does Ebenezer Scrooge anonymously send to the Cratchit family in Charles Dickens' A Christmas Carol? Erm... I am not sure that Tiny Tim would appreciate much champagne, so I'm pretty sure it's not that. Eh, I will go with turkey. Turkey's right. Well done. Steve, the novel Mount!, which has an exclamation mark, set in the horse racing world, is a work by which author? Could have been really dated there and put Dick Francis up as well. But, erm, the only one I really associate with horsey sort of novels is Jilly Cooper, so that'll have to be my answer. Yeah, Dick Francis was - all of his books were horse-based, weren't they? Jilly Cooper's correct. So, one each. Challenger, which of these is a type of suspended sculpture made of delicate components that move in response to air currents? Oh, that's a good one. Not exactly my area of expertise. Erm, portable would suggest that they're moved to a completely different place, erm, I would think. So, I don't think it's portable. Erm, mobile... ..doesn't sound right. Eh... Versatile, if you think, yeah, would need to, if it moves due to the wind, it would need to be versatile. So for that reason I will go with versatile. Versatile. Your team-mates are wincing, though. Team-mates? I think it's mobile. Mobile, yeah. Mobile. OK. Steve, 2017 was the 30th anniversary of the appearance in print of which literary detective? Mm. Well, it's not Alleyn, that's way back. On balance, I think I've got to go John Rebus, Jeremy. John Rebus is quite right. OK. Mike, your third question. You must get this one right. What name is given to the period of Pablo Picasso's career between 1904 and 1906? I don't know much Picasso. Erm... I think... ..I will... I think blue, Blue Period. He definitely had a Blue Period. Eggheads, do you know this? I think it's rose. I think it's rose, yeah. Did he have an African Period? Some would say, yes. But it's a slightly odd way of naming it. Later on, before Cubism began, he was influenced a lot by African... Yeah. That's what I was thinking. When was the Blue Period? The Blue Period was two or three years before the dates that you mentioned, then the Rose Period, and then... You are right, Kevin, it was just before. Rose Period is the answer here. So you've been knocked out. Steve, you're in the final, there's no way back for our Challenger. So it's level. Return to us, and we'll see what happens in round three. A setback for Masters of Malt. They've lost a brain now from the final round. The Eggheads have also lost one. Looking lively, this contest. The next subject for you is Science. I think it's... THEY LAUGH Who have we got on Science? I think that will be me, unfortunately. Yeah. OK, Graeme. Primary school teacher versus which Egghead? What do you think? Whatever you want. Er... Lisa. We like our Science, don't we? I don't know what planet you're on, Jeremy. THEY LAUGH I'm trying to encourage you! Graeme from Masters of Malt, playing Lisa - on Science - from the Eggheads. Come on, Lisa, we can do this! To ensure there's no conferring, please go to the Question Room now. On Science, Graeme, first or second? I'll go first, please, Jeremy. Here we go with your first question. Which type of creature is most likely to have compound eyes? I definitely don't know for a fact, but I would just guess, based on having sort of multiple lots of eyes and lots of bits to the eyes, that it would most likely be insects. I'm glad you got it right. Yes, it is. A fly has got some sort of amazing combination of eyes. Lisa. Which of these organs in the human body sit in the pleural cavity? And that's P-L-E-U-R-A-L. That would be the lungs. OK. Lungs is right. And we go back to you, Graeme. Here we go. What name is given to a piece of computer code inserted into a programme to fix a bug? I would think, probably on the amount of times they have to get installed on various video games I play, it would be a patch, but I'm not sure. It's a patch. Very good. Lisa. The chemical compound ethylene glycol is commonly used as what? I think it's a sort of alcohol-y thing. So I think that would be antifreeze. Yes, it is antifreeze. Steaming along here. Let's see. Graeme, get this right, put Lisa under some pressure. Which of these species of marine turtle is thought to be the most abundant in the world? I have absolutely no idea. However, I think I've possibly heard of a hawkshill before... or hawksbill, so I'm going to have to go with that one, I'm afraid. The most abundant marine turtle is the olive ridley. Sorry, Graeme. But it's not over yet. Lisa has to get her third question right, and sometimes that doesn't happen, Lisa. What do you mean, "sometimes"?! Here we go. Which species of pine tree produces the heaviest cones, some weighing up to five kilograms? Is it...? I don't know. Pick one and let's get this over with. Um... Monterey pine. Because we're on, what, the West Coast of California? I'm just vaguely thinking things are bigger in America. Big trees, yeah. It's Coulter pine. Ah, well. Ooh, it's a let-off, Graeme, for you. We go to Sudden Death. Two out of three for you both. Gets a bit harder now, OK? Cos I don't give you alternatives. Which word for a shallow receptacle for feeding livestock also means an elongated area of relatively low atmospheric pressure? I want to say a trough. Trough is correct. Thank you. Lisa. Which silvery metal, discovered in the 19th century, has the chemical symbol Sc? Scandium. Scandium is the right answer. Sudden Death we're on. Science is the subject. Graeme, back to you. A yellowjacket is a type of which winged insect? My instinct wants to say wasp, but that seems too obvious. Because wasps already kind of have yellow to them. Yeah, I think I'll just stick with the wasp, since it was the first thing that popped into my head. Wasp is correct. Lisa, to stay in. The Whale and the Doughnut were nicknames given by scientists to shapes on the surface of which heavenly body in 2015? I don't know. Is it as obvious as the moon? Could you say the moon? Well, it is a thing. You can you can send a satellite so far away to take pictures now, it could be any heavenly body. I really don't know, so I will just say the moon. The moon is your answer. Barry would know this. Course he would. Any Eggs know? No. If it's any reassurance, they didn't know either. It's not the moon. Pluto is the answer, and well done, Graeme, you're in the final round. So the Challengers have raced ahead here. Come back to us, please. One more round to play before the final. As it stands, Masters of Malt have lost a brain from the final round, but they're playing really well, the Eggheads have lost two now. The next subject is Music. So, now, which Master of Malt wants Music? That's going to be me, Jeremy. OK, skipper Greg against which Egghead? Who would you like to defeat? Pat or Judith? Judith. Judith. I'm going to take Judith. All right. So, Greg... Terrible mistake! ..from Masters of Malt... Mistake, is it? You love music, don't you? I do love music. But I don't... I'm not very good at, um...facts about it. So, Greg from Masters of Malt, trying Judith on the facts. And please go, for the last time, to our Question Room. Right, so Greg, supporter of the Detroit Lions, against Judith on Music. And would you like to go first or second? I'm going to go first. Here's your question, Greg. The instrument known as the didgeridoo is traditionally made from which material? Well, it's going to be a process of elimination. I have never played a didgeridoo, myself. But I think it's made of wood. It is made of wood, yes. Wood is the right answer. Judith, your question. Which singer had his only UK number-one hit with the song Fly Away in 1999? I have absolutely no idea! And I'm sure everybody else in the world knows. The other... Two of them seem to be well-known, so I imagine they had a lot of hits. I'm going to say Lemmy, who I've never heard of. Ah, Lemmy. I'm just trying to think how you could get to the answer without all the facts, there. Cos Leo Sayer, you could say, as you sort of did, well, he had other hits, other number ones, When I Need You and so on. Lemmy was the lead singer of Motorhead. So we were looking for Lenny Kravitz. Bad luck on that. Greg. Katie Melua recorded a version of which Sting song as the official 2017 Children In Need single? I've not heard of Katie Melua for quite a while now. I know she was a bit popular a couple of years ago. Eh... I think this is Fields Of Gold. Yes. Very well done. Fields Of Gold. So, Judith, you need to get this one right. "From the very first time I rest my eyes on you, girl, "my heart says follow through", are lyrics from which Bob Marley song? Well, No Woman, No Cry is the famous one, but... ..it just seems too long a sentence to get into No Woman, No Cry, that. I don't know. I'm going to say Could You Be Loved. Waiting In Vain is the answer, Judith. Waiting In Vain. And I'm so sorry. Two wrong answers was fatal there. And, Greg, you're in the final round. This is looking good for these Challengers, well done! So come back, join your teams. We will play the final round for $4,000. And this is what we've been playing towards. It's time for our final round, which, as always, is General Knowledge. But I'm afraid those of you who lost your head-to-heads won't be allowed to take part in this round, so it's Mike from Masters of Malt, and it's also Lisa and Judith and Kevin from the Eggheads, would you please now leave the studio? Greg, Luke, Steve and Graeme, you're playing to win Masters of Malt $4,000. This is a good position here that you've got to, so well done. Steve and Pat, here you are with a last-ditch defence to try and keep the Eggheads' run going. As usual, I will ask each team three questions in turn. This time, they're all General Knowledge. You can confer. So, Masters of Malt, the question is, can you finish the job here? What's the American football analogy, can you...touchdown? A touchdown, yeah. And overwhelm these two brains with your four. And would you like to go first or second? We'll go first, please, Jeremy. All right. Here we go. In which famous song do these lyrics appear? "And was the holy Lamb of God on England's pleasant pastures seen, "and did the countenance divine shine forth upon our clouded hills?" It's Jerusalem. Do you think it's Jerusalem? Yeah, I think so. Cos I think it's a...isn't it a rugby song? It is. Yeah. The whole thing with the World Cup... The Jerusalem team. Yeah. So I think it's Jerusalem, as well. We happy with that? Go for that? Yeah. Jerusalem, please, Jeremy. Jerusalem's correct. Well done. OK, over to you, Eggheads. What word is normally used to describe the study of the production and consumption of goods and services of a country as a whole? Macro? I think it's macro. Um... That's what I'd have gone for my own, so... Macroeconomics. Macroeconomics is correct. OK. Your question. Which of these bones is found in the foot, Challengers? I don't think it's the radius, cos that's in your arm. I've not heard of a vomer. Vomer... ..not...I've never heard of that. No. Calcaneus? Calcaneus? The only one I remember's the metatarsal, you know... Yeah. Calcaneus? Shall we just...? Yeah, take a punt on that. I think that's... Right, we'll go for... Calcaneus, yeah. Calcaneus? You've got it right. Well done. Calcaneus is right. They're in the lead, Eggheads, as they've been for much of this contest. To catch up, your question. Which Irish actor stars as a successful surgeon in the 2017 film The Killing Of A Sacred Deer? Colin Farrell, I've seen it. Colin Farrell, yeah? We think that's Colin Farrell. It is Colin Farrell. You've seen it, Steve? Is it good? It's strange. Strange. OK. Third question. Get this right, pressure's on them. Might be the last thing you need to do today. Which of these buildings was awarded architecture's Stirling Prize in 2017? Wow. Got any idea? I'm not a fan of architecture! Awards, especially. I would like to go for Glasgow, just cos... Yeah. That, and I think the college is a new building, as well. Yeah. I think they rebuilt it. A pier... I...I don't think Hastings Pier's going to be awarded now. You think it's a previous award? Yeah. So City of Glasgow College? Yeah. I'm happy with that. City of Glasgow College. So it was the architecture Stirling Prize in 2017, and it wasn't the City of Glasgow College. It was actually Hastings Pier. Oh! Oh, well. So Hastings Pier is the answer, which gives the Eggheads a chance to take the contest. Which UK zoo opened its gates for the first time in 1931? It's not London Zoo. I think London is older. Yeah. I think Chester Zoo is pretty old. You fancying Bristol, then? I don't know about Chester. I don't know. I just know it's not London. Well, Chester...I think Chester is long-established, but I'm not certain, so... I'm up to go Bristol, if that's what you... So we think London is older than that. Yeah, definitely. We've got...an unsatisfactory suspicion that Chester may be older than that. Maybe on that spurious sort of logic, go Bristol? Bristol. Yeah. Well, we don't know this. But we're confident in dismissing London Zoo, and we're just hoping that Chester Zoo is the longer-established. Which leads us to opt for Bristol. I'll give you the dates, actually. London, 1828. Bristol Zoo, 1836. HE WHISTLES You're miles and miles out. Right. Nearly a century out. Chester Zoo is the answer. That's a let-off for you Challengers, there. After three questions, you're level. We go to Sudden Death in the final round, playing for $4,000. I don't give you different options. Which UK national daily newspaper adopted the slogan "The intelligent tabloid" in 2013? Name some tabloids... You have, like, The Sun. Daily Mail. Sun. Not that. Is it not going to be one that's perhaps trying to get away from the fact that it's a tabloid? Yeah, trying to promote itself as more intelligent. Is the Daily Mail a tabloid? Is the Express a tabloid? I was thinking...I think the Daily Mail. If not that, then I'd probably say the Express, but I don't... I don't see The Sun or the Star or anything... No. I don't see any of the other ones... No. ..even attempting... There's not one called, like, the IT Times, is there? But The Times is not a tabloid. No, the IT. What do you think? I actually don't know, so... OK. Yeah. We're going to take a shot in the dark here, and we're going to say the Daily Mail. Daily Mail. It's actually a newspaper I don't think you even mentioned. Yeah? The Mirror. Oh. Oh. So you're not out. This is the key thing. You've been playing really well. However, the Eggheads do have a Sudden Death question in hand, and if they get this right, the contest is over. Kings Heath and Moseley are suburbs of which large UK city? Are they parliamentary constituencies? Do they ring any bells? There is a Moseley down near the Thames... ..but Kings Heath doesn't ring a London bell with me. It's not Birmingham, is it, Kings Heath? Birmingham... Mm. Pff... Moseley. Moseley Shoals, where's that...? Manchester, Leeds, Newcastle...? I don't think it's... Birmingham... I'd probably go with Manchester. Bristol... My first thought was Birmingham, but very, very un... Really? Yeah. Just a....just a whim. It's just the heath bit, because I think Birmingham City was called Small Heath, the football team. Not that that means a deal. I think Aston Villa were Little Heath. Mm. They do sound very constituency-like, don't they? Yeah. Shall we...? Shall we take our chances, throw ourselves at the mercy of Birmingham? Yeah, yeah. We don't know, Jeremy. We feel we should. They sound really constituency-like names. But we're going to go for Birmingham. Birmingham is your answer. So I was going through constituencies in my mind and thinking, "Hang on, Edgbaston..." Birmingham Small Heath, is there? There's a lot of them. But then it rang a bell, cos Kings Heath is the first place that UB40 played live. Do you know the answer? Well, UB40 are from Birmingham, so... Yeah. Yeah, UB40 are from Birmingham. Birmingham is right. Well done, Eggheads. You've done it, you've won the contest. And thank you for a great challenge. Really, really good. Sorry, Masters of Malt. The Eggheads are starting to gather pace, here, and they've done what comes naturally. They reign supreme over quizland once again. It does mean you're not going home with the $4,000. We will roll the money over to our next show. Eggheads, congratulations. Join us next time, to see if a new team of Challengers have the brains to defeat the Eggheads. There'll be $5,000 to play for. Until we quiz again. Goodbye.
