[music playing] [rumble] NARRATOR: It was the worst of times. It was the worst of times. Lovely Lizzie signed that check as diamonds hang from your throttled neck. You try so hard to peer inside, not seeing beyond what has already died. Rebel rouser, call me Phyl. Dress so dark, won't take the pill. Live to love yet love to hate. You hold the key that guard the gate. Six years passed, yet not a word. Nothing shared, the rumor stirred. Friends as kids, yet torn apart. Regretting now the change of heart. So what then was the ugly deed? A broken promise, petty greed? Did one depart with no remorse, menstrual mood, unsigned divorce? Was it wicked sin or childish play? Or did one forget the other's birthday? White knuckles bang the door of fate. Inside she waits in strong debate. Mistake, perhaps, this forced reunion as destiny invites confusion. ELIZABETH (VOICEOVER): When I look into a mirror, I see a stranger looking back. When I look into a mirror, I see an ugly man with cancer on his face. [accordion music] [drums] [scream] [music playing] Let's get you a drink. I'll get it. Phyl. Elizabeth. [eerie music] May I take your coat? No. Thanks, but thanks. How was the flight? Good. It was really good, you know, like a flight. You have a really great place. Thank you. Hoity toity. I like it. You look good. Are you good? I'm good. I'm starving. Thank you, Cha-Cha. Could you bring some champagne out please? Did you say Cha-Cha? Yeah, it's her name. Oh, OK. Got yourself a slave, huh? Yeah. Get her to do all the work for you. She does get paid, you know. I know. She looks pretty happy. She is. Hm, this looks quaint. Dig in. All right. Fabulous, champagne. I think I need a glass. Me too. Thank you, Cha-Cha. You drink, right? I sure do. Haven't changed. Thank you. You're welcome. [eerie music] Will there be anything else? Um, this is fine. Thanks. Thanks a lot. To, uh-- Life. OK, life. Welcome to LA. [burp] Sorry, I'm sure it's expensive. Um-- It's not cheap. Actually, I don't know. My neighbor gave it to me. Eh, it's all right. I would have bought a cheaper one though. You haven't changed a bit. Nope. Oh. So you got a boyfriend? Uh, not at this exact moment. Not at this exact moment. I dumped him. Long relationship? It was sort of long, about two month. Two months, that's a record. Yeah. What about work? Uh, it's good. I've been working a lot, actually. I saw one of your exhibits. Was that the elephant photo essay? Yes. I especially liked the one with the midget on the elephant. Yeah well, I like midgets. You know that. It looked like Mom. Kind of ironic there. Mom looks like anything deformed. You smoke? You never smoked. Well, Jean Louis smokes, so it's kind of hard to live with a smoker unless you smoke yourself. Jean Louis smokes, so you smoke? Ha ha, I think it's funny. I think it's really funny, actually. You're smoking. I mean-- ELIZABETH: You used to smoke. Yeah, but I was sort of doing it-- You were 12. You used to smoke. Yeah, but I was doing it for show. Is that why you're doing it? No, I just got used to it, I guess. I've only been doing it for two months. Two months of this, looking really cool. So you're addicted, right? Two months and you're addicted. Not at all. So you're just smoking. Yes, I'm smoking, Phyllis. I'm smoking, yes. Don't get sensitive. Jesus, I'm just saying you're smoking. Anyway, you ever talk to Mom or Dad? Nope. You? Every day. How's Mom? [eerie music] ELIZABETH: She's great. She's great. How long has it been since we've seen each other? ELIZABETH: My wedding. Six years next month. Six years. I'll never forget that. Boy, did you make a scene. It was the only wedding I've ever been to then, you know, or since. And I don't want to go to any more weddings. That's depressing, boy. Whoo, it's like a funeral. It's like death. You have such a macabre outlook. [eerie music] [laughter] NARRATOR: Who is Mom? Why is Mom? What is Mom? You know I've been going through this really weird feeling lately about just knowing I'm going to die young. I think everybody goes through that at a certain age. I went through it too. No, but I-- ELIZABETH: Then we sort of push it to the limit. I mean really, though. I mean really. ELIZABETH: In what way? Like every single night, I wake up feeling completely alone like-- like I know I'm going to die. Suddenly I had this realization. I'm going to die. Have you been self-destructive? Have I been self-destructive? No. Doing drugs, or- No. Drinking too much, or-- No. I drink, but I don't drink much. ELIZABETH: It could just be fear of failure, fear of success, fear of changing, growing old. No, it's fear of death. Fear of ending-- ELIZABETH: Why do you fear death? Everything. ELIZABETH: Why do you fear death? I think I fear death mainly because I-- I-- I think I like life a lot. Even though it sucks, I like it. -Do you? Yeah. That's good to hear. PHYL: You don't even think about death, do you? Never. PHYL: Just positive. I'm going to live forever. PHYL: You're a pretty corpse. Burn me. Eh, then I think burning flesh. It makes me sick. ELIZABETH: Do you remember the time when you were sitting on the stove? And Mom said, don't touch the stove. We had that stupid housekeeper. She left for 10 minutes, and you burnt the entire-- oh God, I'll never forget the smell. Burning flesh. Yep, and the stink of your own flesh is even worse. ELIZABETH: And you did not cry. You refused to cry. I never cried. I never cried. Just when you're alone. [music playing] ELIZABETH (VOICEOVER): I wish I could tell Phyl about my real fears. I fear that I'll be forgotten once I'm buried. The years melt into my skin like waves into the beach. Time is supposed to be for living. I spend my time waiting. Waiting for what, I don't know. I know my life will leave the same everlasting impression as a footprint in the sand. [eerie music] It hasn't been easy raising those two demons. I said, no running. No running in the house. No running! I have two of the most beautiful daughters you'd ever want to see in your life. Oh, they are so great. They are so gorgeous. So we talk a lot, my daughters and I. We have our-- I-- I talk to them like I'm-- like I'm Judge Hardy and they're Mickey Rooney or something. We have that father-- father and daughter relationship where we just talk to each other. Reggie, would you like to do some singing? Huh, you want to sing with us? Huh? Let's sing. (SINGING) Do, re, ah, ah, ee, ah, ee, ah. Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah [howling] Sh, sh, sh. Sh. Get away. Go, go. No, it's OK. Sweet-- Get off the table! Come on, go. Well-- oh, that's attractive. PHYL: I know. -Thank you. Thank you. This is a classy joint, here. PHYL: I know. I'm pregnant. PHYL: Are you kidding? You're pregnant! I had this whole way planned of telling you. I was going to build up to it. Say, do you notice a blossom? I do notice a sort of fat glow about you. ELIZABETH: Thank you. No, not really. You're just a little bloated. ELIZABETH: I'm pregnant. I think that's-- ELIZABETH: I'm so excited. That's great. ELIZABETH: I am so-- me, a mom. -I can see it. I can see it. ELIZABETH: The quintessential Beverly Hills mother. Absolutely. I'm two weeks pregnant, I went maternity shopping. OK, it's me. I get carried away. I'm sorry. I go into the store, oh, I'll take that. How long are you, darling? Two weeks. I may even lose-- I mean, you know. But it's-- it's just me. I'm really looking forward to all the stupid things. All the-- you know-- the-- I don't know. Taking him for picnics. And why do I say he? I know it's going to be a boy because God forbid there be a little Elizabeth running around here. PHYL: You don't want a girl at all? Would you want another one of me? PHYL: No. ELIZABETH: Would you-- PHYL: I want another one of Mom. ELIZABETH: Thank you. Oh, God. But I bet you it will look just like Jean Louis. Jean Louis. ELIZABETH: Is he going to have his nose? I hope not. You should really be concentrating on being pregnant, and being fat, and seeing what it's like to have-- You're really into this fat thing. Well of course I am. I mean first of all, you have your body. It's completely normal all the way throughout your life. Right? And all of a sudden, you're fat. And all of a sudden you have the swollen feet. This is what I hear, of course. Well yeah, but I mean there are people. Believe me, I know these women, who will not have children because they're afraid of getting stretch marks. Now to me, it's going to be the first time in my life I can be a pig. I can be a pig. I can eat 24 hours and day, and I can justify it. I'm pregnant. Have another helping, dear. That's fine because I'm pregnant. It's going to be great! I mean it's-- I can eat anything I want. All these years of no eating-- Yep, no guilt. No guilt at all. It will be great. Wait a minute, you're smoking? ELIZABETH: No. Baby killer sticks. ELIZABETH: I'm two weeks pregnant. Two weeks pregnant, the baby's in there. You're killing it. It's a little embryo. It's not even-- it's-- it's-- NARRATOR: Black and blue skid mark lunch box drools pasta free. Frozen bacon pie suffering from the heat cries out in the siren of pork. Freeze frame. Mom and Dad are trying to think, we hope. I starting collecting these when I was about-- well, when my birthday was. And that's when I got this. And so the first time I ever used it was-- all these bees came into my house because their hive was on top on my roof. And so I found all these dead bees all around. And so I put them right in here. And then-- [music playing] I think all this blackness and rebellion is just a bunch of bull. PHYL: Do you? Yeah, I think it's real pretentious. I think you're faking it. You want to talk about fake? I think you think you're being really trendy really cool, really New York. Can I ask you a question? ELIZABETH: Any time. How long did it take you to get yourself to look like that this morning? Only about half as long as it took you to look bad on purpose. At least I take pleasure in being a woman. Being a woman? That's being a woman, slicking your hair back? I don't claim to be a woman. Why don't you just go gay and come out of the closet. Maybe I have already. Don't make me sick. PHYL: You're always sick, aren't you? No, I said don't make me sick. That's your being sick making me sick. This is really pleasant. PHYL: I'm so glad I got to meet-- [inaudible] on a weekend. PHYL: Thanks. [eerie music] Phyl, Elizabeth, leave me alone. I've had enough of you. I can't stand you. Everywhere I go, you're around me. I'm going to send you off to military school, you maggots. I can't handle you. Just get away from me. Leave me alone and stay out of my things. I hate you. I hate you. We're going to send you to military school. You're going to military school. You too. What are you staring at, you little maggot? I hate you! NARRATOR: Know how to begin? There they go. Chicken fight. They must be women. They must be cats. Twice the size of each other's girth, twisting, shouting, screaming, clawing. So sense, no sound, no love, no hate. Flavor pie with a twist of Gandhi. I want to talk about phoniness for just one minute. Right. First of all, I detect a distinct difference in your nose, like maybe something has been changed. I'm not sure. I don't want to be presumptuous here, but I noticed a little-- Listen, a lot has changed in five years, Phyl. A nose changed in five years. I think noses-- It's none of your business. It's just the point. It's none of your business anymore. You're miserable. I'm fine. I'm happy. PHYL: But you know what? I'm happy. PHYL: I think you're miserable too. You hope that I would be miserable. That justifies your miserableness. What am I, your psychotherapist? Is that you need, to talk to somebody? I'm happy to talk to you, but don't start with my problems. I don't have any problems. Oh, no problems. She's problem-free. ELIZABETH: You sound like Mom. You look like Mom. Thank you. PHYL: You're welcome. She has a nose job too. ELIZABETH: What is the big deal about my nose? Fine, I'm plastic, head to toe. Now can we start a new subject? Let's get to the point. Point-- yeah, it does have a point. Doesn't it? ELIZABETH: Why don't you talk to Mom? Because I hate her. ELIZABETH: Why? Because she is a plastic bitch. [laughter] [eerie music] ELIZABETH: That would be a great excuse. That would be a great reason, but she's never done anything to hurt you. PHYL: You know that she-- ELIZABETH: All I know is all your life, you have been this rebellious, miserable little sh-- why do you try to be ugly? Why do you try and hurt yourself? Why do you try and make other people angry? What are you hiding from? People like you. ELIZABETH: So why are you here? Look, my life is fine without you. I don't need a sister, OK. I never had one. When I needed you, I tried. You weren't there. And I don't need you now. You need me more than you ever did. ELIZABETH: I don't need you. You have become this complete non-person. You have become-- ELIZABETH: You are so pretentious. You so-- Why don't you go back to Tribeca and live in your loft. Ooh, God. ELIZABETH: New York, oh you're just so New York. [eerie music] NARRATOR: Gandhi's back teeth pudding. When offered gum, she replied, no thanks. When I chew gum, I think I chew gum. Korean hair and coconut milk frozen juice bars. Oversized man fell overboard, splash. Yes, Phyllis, she smokes. Dog tooth necklace worn by a cat. The tension mounts. Vaginal riots in the Middle East. Do I have a choice? Do I have an option? Mommy, I love you. Boogie mama, disco queen, midnight whore. Peas and onions. Of course, peas and onions. You hate everything. You hate LA. You hate my plasticity. PHYL: Yeah, I do. It's real. I'm sorry. PHYL: Real? Open your eyes. PHYL: Real? Yeah. PHYL: Like "Dynasty" is real? You just love to stick people into these little molds. Well, you fit so perfectly into a mold. ELIZABETH: So then leave the mold. You and Mom are exactly alike. ELIZABETH: Thank you. You are exactly alike. ELIZABETH: Thank you. In fact, I'm sure that you'll be getting a breast job any minute now because your boobs are going to start sagging. You're excused. Phyl, she'll probably marry a clown. That's all she knows how to go out with, clowns. That's why you wore ripped jeans to my wedding. So? ELIZABETH: That was nice. I drew a picture on my knee. Why did you even bother showing up? Because I wanted to see you in your blissful happiness. ELIZABETH: You wanted to see me walk and suffer. Are you happy now with Jean Louis telling you what to do all the time. I hate French men. For somebody who hasn't been involved in my life and has no right to make any judgments, I don't even have to explain what my relationship is. Do you still run whenever he tells you to get him something? He's been very good to me. And at least I've opened up and tried to have a relationship. Unlike you, who's run from anything good in your life. I don't need to have a relationship. You don't need anything, do you? PHYL: That's right. I don't. -Oh fine. You're just great by yourself. Then, go. PHYL: I'm happy. I'm happy. I'm glad. PHYL: I can be happy. You look happy. You look happy. I don't have to have somebody to absorb into. I can sit there. And I can be alone. And I can have a good time. You know what I think you do when you're alone? I think you get really scared. I think that's why you have-- have this sick sort of thing about always having to be with a guy. Ever since you were 13, you had a boyfriend. And there was never one moment you didn't have a boyfriend. You had no space in between guys. ELIZABETH: I like love. -Love? ELIZABETH: I'm not afraid of love You like being with someone else. You can't even spend one minute-- What is wrong with that? We're human beings. We're supposed to be with other people. You want to be alone, live alone. Be a hermit. I can see you. You're going to be 60 years old, unhappy, no children, no grandchildren. Fine, you'll be miserable. -No. No, I won't. ELIZABETH: Yeah, you will. No, I'll be with someone that I finally eventually want to be with. At least I don't have sex with guys-- constantly have to be with them. You've had plenty of sex, but do you ever make love? Ooh, oh, God. Talk about psychology 101. Give me a break. A little Zen wouldn't hurt you. [music playing] NARRATOR: Love seldom has a point of view. It stalks its prey like vultures do. One never expects it from me of you, as the jester mocks his piercing cue. Be careful. We smell an erection. [cartoon-like music] Mommy, Mommy. Phyl cut her finger. She needs a Band-Aid. Phyl, you're always having problems disturbing me. Were you in my things again? You know better than that. NARRATOR: The blue hangman chewed glass on the Wisconsin-bound A train last night. Cross-examined by his own peers, he forgave their trust and headed east, away from the sun, away from himself. Pick up those toys. You know, whatever I do for my wife, she doesn't seem to be satisfied. Phyl looks like a boy. I could have done so many other things. I don't mean sexually. She must have been satisfied. [train whistle] What did she ever do to you? Oh my God. She completely ignored me. I mean, she had absolutely no interest in my life at all. She hated my friends. She hated everything about me. I mean she never even went to see any of my art shows when I was in high school. You know that. All she did was go to your functions and your little plays. And she never was interested in my life at all. She always treated you like the little princess, you know. And I know you were a wanted baby. And I know I wasn't a wanted baby. They didn't want me, and I think she even tried to abort me. I heard her talking to Dad about that once. And you know, one thing I can't believe more than anything is that I caught her more than once poking the gardener over and over again. I mean, I can't even believe that she did that. I'm going to tell you something about Mom, Phyl. She has never, never cheated on Dad. You weren't there watching, were you? [music playing] [scream] [laughter] [crying] Liz! Liz, I-- I-- Phyl, Phyl, Phyl. Phyl, where are you? Honey, where are you? I want you. [music playing] You're exactly alike. You are exactly alike. You don't even know her. What the hell do you know anyway? How can I even tell you what I'm thinking about her because you are exactly alike. You won't even know the difference. I'm listening, but you never listen. Just take a chance and open up. You are so blind. I can't even believe it. Blind to what? Blind to who you are and they way you are with Mom, and the way you guys are together. Look, Mom is fine. You're the one with the problem. All right? No, Mom is not fine. She's 62 and wearing high heeled shoes and tight pants. What the hell is wrong with that? She's sickening. She's sickening. You're just-- you're just jealous, that's all. No, I'm not jealous. She's an embarrassment! How did she hurt you anyway? What did she do to you? Look at all the shit you've done to her. Look at all the stuff you've done to her. I didn't do anything to her. I was just born, and she hated me. ELIZABETH: You hurt her so bad, you don't even know. Why? She doesn't deserve it. -No. No, I don't think it's hurt. I think it's more like disappointed her. I didn't do anything right for her. I didn't do one thing right. You looked right. Everything was perfect that you did. Everything I did sucked. You are so narrow minded. You never gave the woman a chance to be a mother. She loves you so much it hurts her. All she does is ever try and try with you, and you push her away. You are so full of it. Phyl, why don't you just grow up? I can't believe that you actually think-- I'm defending her because she loved me because I let her love me. She's a damn good mother. If you would just open your eyes and stop being so goddamn immature, you'd learn. Boy, I can't believe it. You're so dramatic. You always get-- ELIZABETH: Go to hell. You just flick everything away like it's nothing. And that's what your life is. It's nothing. Mom is a good woman. She tries. She works her butt off. She's 62 years old and she's still trying to know you, her daughter. She's not ever real. I mean, do you realize this crystal thing that she's getting into? She's into crystals now. She's in that Ramtha thing. I mean this is sad. This is something that I can't even relate to. Phyllis, why don't you just stop avoiding all that superficial junk that you're talking about and just get to the point. You hate her because she's like you. She hurt you. How? Name one thing she-- By hating me! She hates me. You hate yourself. How could anyone not hate you? I hate you. [music playing] Shut up! Just shut the-- You're so afraid of the truth. Listen! Did you ever send me a Christmas card? A Christmas card? [music playing] PHYL (VOICEOVER): I wish I could tell Liz about my blackest fears, how ugly everything is to me, how I can love nothing. Sometimes I feel so afraid, afraid of what I'm doing, where I'm going, what I'll find when I get there. I think I'm searching for something. I don't know what it is. But even if I find it, I'm sure I'll hate it. [inaudible] teases me with images of death, but I'm always left unsatisfied. I'm killing myself, Liz. Over and over, I'm killing myself. Like Prometheus, I die again and again. Always in pain, endless pain. NARRATOR: Sold out, shut down, lied to in shame. Dime store gin-soaked victim of the game. She bought all the lies. He sold them at half price. I saw it in her eyes, not just once, but twice. Daddy's little girl, not quite the boy he wanted. As the shine escapes the pearl, her every move so haunted. Blackjack parallel, the city filled with gold. The preacher watches from the cell, no chance to break the mold. Or so he thought. And in the name of God, she prays silently that some other shipwrecked drifter will finally die and accept the blame. This is going to be hard for me. What is it? I'm going to have to ask you something. What? I need to borrow some money. You phony. YOUNG ELIZABETH: What are you guys laying around for? I hate you. I hate you. I hate you. I hate you. Jenny, I can't-- I just can't take it anymore. Can I rest on your shoulder? Here. Oh, I know it's awful living in this house, dealing with these awful people. Yeah. I feel like-- like a little homeless frog whose lily pad was snatched out from under it. Oh, I know it. Oh, I can relate. I reach. I reach to you. And he had such a style and so much equipment, which doesn't work anymore. If you had the wife like I-- what would you do? I wonder what you would do. What would you if you had a wife like I've got? Then I have this mirror that's down on the bottom floor. And it has lots of bugs on it, and so I got some bugs from there Remember Tracy Feldman, my friend in eighth grade with the red hair? Yeah. I ran into her the other day. So? It's really sad. She lost her face. Oh my God. She has no face. It's really horrible what happens to people's lives. Look, what a pretty flower. [music playing] Aunt Sparkle! Aunt Sparkle! How are you little honeys? Let me give you a kiss. Oh, I love you. [cough] Careful. I got a present for both of you. Here you go. It's a couple cigarettes. Now get out of here. I tell you, Cel, ever since I got my throat operation, I can just barely even touch these things. How many are you smoking now? About two packs a day. That's better than four packs a day. It is, but-- oh still hell. Now, Cel, being my sister, I tell you everything. Don't I? I hope that you do. I want you know who I'm dating now. I'm dating a very nice young man by the name of Spiro. You might know him. That wouldn't be the famous Spiro? Spiro, the one and only. Your two girls are turning out to be gorgeous little girls. They're very good little girls to you. I can't stand them. Well, you and I have always had a little difference in that department. I love kids, but I guess that's because I've never been able to have any. Well, I always wanted boys. Well, you can always have an operation. I hate weasels. Hear the thunder of the weasels. NARRATOR: Captured faces from the dead weight of fatigue arise silently, cautiously, secretly. Their features of hateful, smirking folds line ear to ear, back to back, eyes to mind. They float, watch, and wait. The moist warmth of congealed, dripping phlegm cascades outwardly from their fiery orifices, filling my open, blistered mouth. Their poison glares surface quickly as the [inaudible] multiply at will. I um-- I have a secret. I have a really neat secret. I love secrets. PHYL: I guess that means you want to know then, huh? Of course. Math. That's a hell of a secret. Math, what math? Me, you, what? After school algebra, Mr. Trainer, high school algebra teacher, sex! How did you know? Professor Trainer, you know how important it is for me to get an A in algebra. I followed you guys home. -No! -Yes. Phyllis! PHYL: Yes. ELIZABETH: No, you didn't-- PHYL: You were 15. ELIZABETH: You saw? PHYL: Yes, I saw. ELIZABETH: No! PHYL: It was the first time I saw anybody have sex. The hardest part for me was having him as a teacher after you. ELIZABETH: Horrible-- I hid it so well. I was so cool. PHYL: No, you didn't. You'd come home smelling like math teacher. I don't know. I think older, decrepit, bad-- ELIZABETH: He was not decrepit. PHYL: He was like 70 years old. ELIZABETH: He was sexy. He was 48. PHYL: I bet his balls were like really long. ELIZABETH: Oh, you're sick. I don't even remember. NARRATOR: The sea of blue on sands of gold will forever embrace together growing old. A bond of which the gods approve, she is on top, king of the [inaudible]. For my back yard, I got some pill bugs. And then for my front yard, I got some pieces of a snail shell. And-- Have you ever heard of Uncle Nazi's House of Gumballs? Peas and onions. Peas and onions. I usually like my eggs over medium in the morning without the mucus on them. If they're scrambled, they've got to be wet. I kind of like them with a lot of pepper and salt so you don't really taste the embryo. The best is over easy. Without slime. Fried! PHYL: I like them poached. Poached is good. ELIZABETH: I like them boiled. Yeah, boiled is good. Boiled hard. Hard boiled. PHYL: Three minute hard boiled. ELIZABETH: Three minutes, twenty seconds hard boiled. But the shell, the shell is one of the best things about an egg. I don't eat the shell. I don't either. Hurts my teeth. [music playing] NARRATOR: Afternoon chaos turned to laughter as the lady in grey pierces the surface of a private aquarium. Peach body held tight by the warmth of day, eyes fixed to locate, steady flow consumed. A charred eruption takes, suddenly, the safety from her glow. No place to hide, clear water raging black. Looking hard for shallow hope, it's gone. She consumed it long ago. Mascara bleeding, eyes of fire turned to stone. Forced smile fading, laughing jackal breaks the bush. Wow. You always did have the better body, didn't you? You always did have the better mind. Yeah, you're right. You, um, didn't tell me whether of not I could have the money. [eerie music] I didn't want girls. I wanted two boys, two young boys. Two lean, sexy, young men. Hi, I'm Phyllis! [squeaking] Tasted like a bad cigarette. That hurts! [screaming] He's really scary. Stop it! Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Uh, you need some shoes because you don't know if there's any poisonous bugs. And you need some tweezers because I don't know if you should pick them up with your hands. And you need to turn over lots of rocks because that's where they usually are. [harp] Well I used to live next door to Lizzie and Phyl. And well, my mother didn't like me hanging out with them because they thought her mother was a little strange. They were kind of evil people. But they liked to collect bugs, and I loved to collect bugs. So, you know, we would go out together. I-- I used to have like a little butterfly net and a little container to keep the bugs in. And then when they died I could pin them, and label them, and things like that. So-- anyway, so we would go out. And they were really cruel to the bugs. And that kind of bothered me. You know, they'd kind of pick off the wings and-- and count off the legs as they picked them off. And they used to laugh at it, and poke them with needles, and things like that. And then burn them and singe them until they died. And that really bothered me. In fact, one night-- well they came over to spend the night, and-- well, I had this African beetle in this little case-- this little glass case that I kept by my bed that my grandfather had gotten-- and well, I woke up in the morning and the beetle was gone. And, um, well I saw this little leg sticking out of Lizzie's mouth. And they were evil children. I don't know what they're like now, but they were-- they were mean. [music playing] So what are you going to name it? Idiot. You never will know what it's like to be the oldest. PHYL: Surprise, surprise. When you were born, I really hated you because-- I tell you-- it's great being an only child. Well when you were born, all of a sudden I didn't get any more hugs. And I didn't get that special attention, undivided attention, that two parents give to just one kid. And you were cuter. You were. And you were smaller and blonder. And all of a sudden, I was forced to be older, older than I was. And what I really think that I missed out on-- what maybe makes me what you seem to want to think I am-- is just that I wasn't allowed to be a baby. I always had to be the one that did things right. All of a sudden, the ice princess that you know as Mom couldn't hold me because that would make me weak. Strong kids don't cry. Men don't cry. Oldest kids don't cry. And all of a sudden, you were rejecting that attention. And I wasn't getting that attention. So I became cold. And when I turned to Dad for it, he just thought I was too strong. I was like Mom. I didn't need it. And I really miss being a kid. I never got to be a baby. I never-- I never got to run around like you, and be immature, and swear, and say stupid things because it just wasn't right. It was a classy. It was tacky and cheap. God, I resent that. It sounds so pathetic. And you say, well you could have changed. You could have been yourself, but Phyl, I couldn't. They just expected so damn much. It was like I was their hope, and I was a good one. And I'm so sick of being good. I'm so sick of it. It is so hard to get away when you're this deep. You can't just walk away. You can't just say all of a sudden, OK, I've been this person for 28 years, and now I'm going to be somebody else, myself. Come on. She's been hiding for 62 years. That doesn't make me look so bad, huh? PHYL: Have you ever, um, cheated on your husband? Yeah. [screaming] Stay down. Somebody will see us. Don't ever tell him. I swear to God, don't ever tell him. I just wanted somebody to tell me I was pretty. God, it felt so good. And that I was interesting. You love it. You're glad I did. Yeah, so I get this call. And-- from pick-up this lady out in Beverly Hills or something. And I go up there, and I pick her up. I'm taking off to somebody's house, and we stop. And she tells me she's got some problem. And she's looking at me awful funny, you know. And she says, don't I know you from someplace? I said, no. No, lady. Just give me the money and let me go. She says, how about if we make a trade off? And I said what? Next thing I know, she's jumping all over me saying, Bobby, Bobby, Bobby. One second. I'll be there in five minutes. I got to go. I-- I ask you again. What would you do? I know what I would like to do. I'd kind of like to just strangle her. I don't care if I ever see them again. In fact, I don't even love them. I don't even like them. I hate them. NARRATOR: They used to call me Wheezy, now they called me Moe. Busted liver, three-pronged free base device. My chin, she is on fire. The erosion was fast. The lectures were not. He pondered high atop the mountain of Fig Newtons. Hey Vasquez, we know all about you. Winter, spring, summer, cheese. Hovering above pasta, she thought, why me? Wasn't he the guy from "Taxi?" Don't do that. You're surely implode. My ears. Good God, what's happened to my ears? Suction frog, panicked lice. She is so beautiful. She's so-- why didn't-- like pure, white milk. She's just so lovely. The weird thing was, before I did it, I didn't think it would mean anything. In fact, I mean I like took it as a joke. I just thought it would be like-- like getting a douche or something like that. And-- I took this friend with me. She has a great sense of humor, really fun. Most of my experiences with other people's abortions and stuff like that was like-- like yours. I mean, you didn't seem bugged about it at all. You were pretty young. And those people I know, just never were really that emotional. You always hear you're supposed to be emotional about it. And so I thought, OK, it's like a pap smear. It's like nothing. And my friend kept making jokes, you know. Like little take it home in a jar jokes. I thought, OK. All right, this is funny. I mean she-- that actually made me laugh. I thought she was pretty funny. And it wouldn't be any big deal. And so, it was a little weird because I didn't bring Jeff. I didn't even tell Jeff about it. I didn't want to tell Jeff about it because it just wasn't right, you know. I mean, I figured what's-- why should he know? You know because he'd probably, you know, try to make me keep it or something, which I could never do. I can't imagine even having a baby at all. But the weird part was-- OK, they gave me a local when I went in there. And it was getting kind of scary because they had these like posters on the ceiling of Rome. Like I want to think of going on a vacation while I'm getting-- and so I was just imagining being in Rome. And it was not-- you know now a pap smear feels, where it sort of kills just to have a little bit of a poke in there? But I was-- I was amazed. It hurt. I mean, it really hurt. it was like taking your cervix and putting a shovel in it or something. It really hurt. One thing that I remember the most about the whole experience aside from looking at Rome and being in Rome is there's this nurse that they have stand next to you. And she does the old hand holding thing if you need to grab something or, you know. And she had the worst breath I have ever smelled in my life. It was vomit breath. And I had to smell this vomit breath while I'm sitting there, you know. And I-- you know, I never had this moral thing about killing babies, that whole thing. But they always had this little skull. You know, it was like-- I mean I really-- I am completely for abortion. I think it's great. But when they-- they stick this thing in you. It like sucks. It just sucks it out of you. Right? And I kept imagining it was like a Perrier bottle or something that got a vacuum. And it's like liposuction. They just suck the fat out of your body. I'm sure you've probably experienced that in your life. And it's like-- it's like a sucking sound. So-- so I've got this-- I've got this vomit breath. I'm in Rome with this vomit breath and this sucking sound. And it really hurt. It was like it was sucking in my utey, you know? And it-- it-- they were kind of acting weird. It wasn't like-- I could tell it wasn't going right. I could tell that there was something wrong just because the doctor was all nervous and talking to me. You know, pretending that nothing was wrong kind of thing. And it-- it started to really hurt bad. And I started sort of dreaming sort of because they gave me more anesthesia. And it just sort of moved into a dream thing. The greatest thing is that I-- I won't be able to have babies anymore because he just said-- he just told me afterwards that I couldn't have babies. And I don't even want babies. I don't even want them. I just don't like the idea that I can't have them if want one. But I-- you know, I think it's probably better because if I can't have babies, then I won't raise like a screwed up kid. Because if I had a baby, it would be as awful as I feel like I turned out to be. So, I wouldn't do that to another person. I'm sorry. [music box playing] Do you think if we weren't sisters we would have been friends? Maybe I should have been the older one. What if we grew up somewhere else? What if you were a boy instead of a girl? I think I should have been the baby. I wish we were twins. Yeah. Maybe things would have been different. [drums] Mom, she got some in my food. NARRATOR: Vacuum cleaner, raging force, foreign may, it ties off for horse. Daddy's eyes on front page news. Mommy accuses innocent Jews. Sister one and sister two, complaining now, can't find a shoe. Mailman at the front door box, secondhand of ringing clocks. Neighbors peak to catch a look. Someone should pause to write a book. You look ridiculous sitting there with that sweater on. I'm cold. MOTHER: You're always cold. I can't help it. You can't help anything. You can't help the fact that you have a sweater that you allow the dog to sleep on. You can't help it. You can't help smirking at the girls. FATHER: I just can't help it. MOTHER: You can't help anything. FATHER: I'm cold. MOTHER: You're cold? This dinner is cold. And blowing your nose the way that you do. Next time we eat, you'll be at the end of the table. FATHER: We had the same dinner yesterday. FATHER: Well, quit blowing your nose. FATHER: We had the same dinner before, and the day before, and the day before. And even on my birthday, we had the same dinner. Where do you get this from? MOTHER: You hired the maid. She fixes it. You're busy looking at her instead of eating it. Under your orders, she fixes it. You tell her what to do. You plan the menu every day. And I'm getting damn sick of it. MOTHER: I could care less what you're getting sick of. You're so stupid. You don't do anything around the house. You're so ugly. I hate you! I hate you. You're ugly! No, I'm not. You never were happy with me. No matter what I do, you can't take it. You can't take it. You can't take it! I'm getting sick of it! I can't stand it anymore, and I'm not going to take it anymore! [yelling] You're a pathetic excuse for a person. You're a pathetic excuse for a father. You're stupid. You can't do anything. You're so ugly! [yelling] (SINGING) Rock-a-bye baby in the treetop. When the bough breaks, the cradle will fall. When the bough break, the cradle will fall. And down will come baby, cradle and all. [laughter] [scream] [dramatic music] Shut up! Why were we always fighting? I miss this. I've dreamt of this. Why don't you spend the night? What about Jean Louis? He's away for the weekend. NARRATOR: Broken promise, stained hope, picture framed. The vision of purity, the absence of dismissal. Each left now to hold the candle as it burns strong though the night. And they must watch very hard for its life. Youthful hearts aware, not soon forgetting the power of twilight on the final day. [music playing] VOICE: Damn, what the hell was that?
