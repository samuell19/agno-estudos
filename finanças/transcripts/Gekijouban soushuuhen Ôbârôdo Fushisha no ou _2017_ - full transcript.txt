DMMO-RPG, YGGDRASIL. This game which was released in 2126 has had a 12-year run. Now, it's facing its last moment. GREAT TOMB OF NAZARICK, NINTH FLOOR, ROUND TABLE ROOM Long time no see, Momonga. Honestly, I didn't expect you'd actually come, Herohero. It has been two years since we last met. Has it been that long? This is bad. I've been working overtime lately. I lost my sense of time. Isn't that worrying? Do you mean my body? I'm really exhausted. I'm sorry. I kept on complaining. Please don't mind it. I should leave now. I'm so sleepy. Please rest well. I'm really sorry. Momonga, thanks for your hard work. I'll see you when I see you. HEROHERO HAS LOGGED OUT Today is YGGDRASIL's last day of service. Should we stay until the last moment? Would we be able to meet again? Where and when would we meet again? Are you kidding me? This is the Great Tomb of Nazarick that we built together. How could you guys give it up so easily? No, that's not right. Nobody betrayed me. That's right. Everyone has their own life. Some have even realized their dreams. It can't be helped that they chose real life. GUILD SEBAS TIAN So, his name is Sebas. And the combat maid squad, Pleiades. You guys were guarding the throne. But in the end, no player ever made it this far. As the guild master, I should move them around one last time. Follow me. Everyone from the guild will forgive my willfulness on the last day, right? Albedo. Was the command... "Standby"? What were her settings again? MENU Highest ranking NPC in the Great Tomb of Nazarick, the Overseer of the Guardians. ALBEDO This is long. I think her creator is that settings maniac, Tabula. AND SHE IS ALSO A BITCH What's this? Bitch? Tabula always did love the contradiction in looks and character. By the way, no matter what, this is too... I originally needed tools. But as long as I have this... AND SHE IS ALSO A BITCH How should I modify her? "She loves Momonga." This is embarrassing. Am I foolish or what? If I'm not mistaken, the command is... "Bow Down." GREAT TOMB OF NAZARICK, TENTH FLOOR, THRONE ROOM Are those relics of the past? Me. Touch Me. Shijuuten Suzaku. Ankoro Mocchi Mochi. Herohero. Peroroncino. Bukubukuchagama. Tabula Smaragdina. Warrior Takemikazuchi. Variable Talisman. Genjiro. That's right. I was happy. I was really happy then. GREAT TOMB OF NAZARICK, TENTH FLOOR, THRONE ROOM I need to wake up by 4 a.m. tomorrow. After the server shuts down, I need to sleep. Otherwise, it'll affect my work. GREAT TOMB OF NAZARICK, TENTH FLOOR, THRONE ROOM Did they postpone the server shutdown? The console won't appear. I can't chat nor contact customer service. What's going on? What's the matter, Lord Momonga? Lord Momonga? Is there any problem? That's odd. I can't contact customer service. Please forgive me. I'm not equipped with the knowledge to answer your question regarding customer service. Her mouth is moving. If you're willing to give me a chance to redeem myself, that would bring me great joy! The NPC is actually talking to me. No way. Is there some kind of glitch? This place is exactly the same. But I can't use the console nor reach the operator. What should I do? Sebas. Yes, sir. Can I give him commands? Well, whatever! Sebas. Go outside of the tomb. Confirm the geographical situation of Nazarick's surroundings. Understood, Lord Momonga. Pleiades, go to the ninth floor. Alert me if there's an intruder. Understood, Lord Momonga. Can NPC understand orders without the specific commands? What the heck is going on? Sure enough, I must figure out a way to contact the operator. Since I can't use the contact function... Message? But can the magic used to connect between players reach customer service? No, can I even use magic now? Lord Momonga. What should I do now? Let me think. Come to me. Yes. She smells nice. Hang on, smell? YGGDRASIL doesn't have this function. Albedo, I'm going to touch you. Yes. She has a pulse. Besides, what the heck is this? Why does an NPC equipped with AI behave like this? It is as if she's alive. But there is the next, final thing. I need to confirm it. Albedo. Can I touch your breast? This is an essential step. That's right, naturally... Ask it naturally. You're fine with that, aren't you? That's not natural at all! Of course. Please touch me as you wish. Let me sort things out. The fact that I could do something R-18 isn't an all-new YGGDRASIL. The possibility of this being another DMMO-RPG game is really low. There's another possibility. The virtual world has become a reality. No way. But... Being able to talk to NPC, their naturally changing expressions, their scent... These are things that weren't reflected in the game. How long am I going to touch her? Albedo, sorry. Will I have my first time here? What should I do with my dress? Should I undress? Or would you like to do the honor? Stop it. Hang on, Albedo. Now isn't the time to do... No, I don't have time for that now. I'm very sorry. It's fine. Albedo, I forgive you for everything. Anyway, I have a command. At your command. Tell all the Floor Guardians except the guardians of the fourth and eighth floors to gather at the amphitheater on the sixth floor. Yes, sir. SIXTH FLOOR, AMPHITHEATER I did it. The ring's teleportation function seems fine. It seems that I can use items. Albedo and the others are set to obey me. Then, what about the other NPCs? This place should be guarded by the dark elf twins created by Bukubukuchagama. Aura? Welcome, Lord Momonga. We welcome you to the floor we're guarding. Mare! That's disrespectful to Lord Momonga! Jump down now! I can't do it, Aura. Mare! I understand. Hurry up. Yes. My goodness. Sorry for making you wait, Lord Momonga. I came here today because I need your help. In YGGDRASIL, I just needed to click on the appearing icons to cast magic. But they're all gone now. But as I focus my consciousness on a deeper level, I can feel the magic's effective range, the cooldown for the next cast, and my own MP. Summon, Primal Fire Elemental. Amazing. Primal Fire Elemental. Its level is 85 or above. Aura, do you want to fight it? Can I? I just remember that I have something to do. Mare! Primal Fire Elemental. Attack the twins! Magic Shield! This is still pretty easy. Casting other spells is fine too. But... Message. As I thought, I can't contact customer service or any of my guild members. Yes. What do you need, Lord Momonga? Message connected. Are you Sebas? What's the surrounding situation? Yes. Great Tomb of Nazarick is surrounded by grassland. There are no artificial buildings, large creatures, or monsters within 1,000m. The same night sky as the one on the sixth floor hangs above me. What? Night sky? Besides, it's not a swamp but a grassland. Does this mean the Great Tomb of Nazarick has been moved to an unknown place? It seems so. Oh, my. Am I the first to arrive? Shalltear. Great Tomb of Nazarick's Floor Guardian of the first, second, and third floors. She's a true vampire. My master. My only dear master. Hang on! Shalltear, you should control yourself. Oh, my. Shorty. So, you're here. It must be hard on you, Mare. Having a crazy older sister like her. Fake breasts. I'm right, aren't I? That's why you deliberately used a portal. Although you want to hurry over, your chest pads will fall if you run too fast. Shut up! You're obviously flat-chested! I'm just 76 years old. But you're undead. How pitiful since you can't grow. Just be content with what you already have. You witch! -You're asking for this. -I miss this. Shalltear's creator, Peroroncino, and Aura and Mare's creator, his older sister, Bukubukuchagama, always fought like this too. How noisy. You guys are taking it too far in front of the Supreme One. Cocytus. The Floor Guardian of the fifth floor. His personality and design follow the settings of a warrior. Thank you for coming, Cocytus. I shall always respond to your summons immediately. Thank you. Everyone, sorry for making you wait. Demiurge. Great Tomb of Nazarick's Floor Guardian of the seventh floor. He is set as the NPC combat leader for when a defensive war takes place. He's a demon. Well then, everyone, offer your loyalty to the Ruler of Supreme Beings. The Floor Guardian of the first, second, and third floors, Shalltear Bloodfallen, at your command. The Floor Guardian of the fifth floor, Cocytus, at your command. The Floor Guardian of the sixth floor, Aura Bella Fiora. I'm also the Floor Guardian of the sixth floor, Mare Bello Fiore. -At your command. -At your command. The Floor Guardian of the seventh floor, Demiurge, at your command. The Overseer of the Guardians, Albedo, at your command. Other than the Floor Guardian of the fourth floor, Gargantua, and the Floor Guardian of the eighth floor, Victim, all the Floor Guardians have come to see the Supreme One. Please give us commands, Ruler of Supreme Beings. We offer our loyalty to you, Supreme One. Lift your heads. Why am I spreading despair aura? Thank you for gathering here today. Thanking us is unnecessary. We are servants who dedicate our body and heart to Lord Momonga. Lord Momonga, to you, we may be lacking. But we swear that we won't let our creators bring shame to you. We swear. -We swear. -We swear. I see. Wonderful, Floor Guardians. Pledge your loyalty to me in the future too. -Yes! -Yes! I'm so tired. These people are serious. That was so scary, Aura. I seriously thought I was going to get squashed. I didn't know he could be as amazing like that. That's Lord Momonga when he shows his dominance. That's right. What's the matter, Shalltear? What's wrong, Shalltear? After feeling that imposing aura, I'm getting a bit excited. I'm feeling it down there. You bitch. Lord Momonga released such a strong wave of power. That's our reward. It's weird if I'm not feeling anything, you big-mouthed gorilla! You lamprey! My look was created by a Supreme Being. Mine as well. Aura. I'll let a woman handle a problem between women. Hang on, Demiurge! Are you throwing the problem to me? If anything happens, I'll stop them. Gosh, this fight is pointless. Cocytus! Personally, I'm quite interested in the end result either from the perspective of strengthening combat or from the perspective of Nazarick's future. What do you mean? A great ruler should have an heir, right? Lord Momonga stayed until the end. But maybe one day, he'll go to the same place as the other Supreme Beings. If that happens, I hope he can leave a person for us to pledge our loyalty to. That means one of them will carry the child of Lord Momonga. That's a disrespectful idea. But don't you want to pledge loyalty to Lord Momonga's descendant? Indeed, I yearn for it. No, it's wonderful. What a fascinating sight. -Would he call me uncle? -By the way, Mare, why are you dressed like a woman? Lord Bukubukuchagama chose this for me. She said this is cross-dressing. There's no mistake about my gender. I see. Boys should probably dress like this in Nazarick then. Right, Cocytus. You can go back. What a wonderful sight. That's a sight I'm after. That's great then. Albedo, Shalltear, are you guys still fighting? They are done. Now, they are... Discussing who the first wife will be. For Nazarick's absolute ruler, having only one wife is too odd. So, regarding who will be the first wife... Now, that's an interesting topic. But can you please give us orders first? Yes, that's right. Shalltear, let's discuss this matter another day. I've no objection. Then, let's discuss our plans. Although I only practice magic, I've reached level 100. My strength is enough to wield most swords. However, I can't equip the weapons and armor of different classes. This fact remains the same. I have no idea what's going on with this world. But the NPCs are still loyal to me. Without friends and family, I go to work, fulfill my duty, and go back home to sleep every day. Should I return to the real world? Lord Momonga. Create Greater Item. Narberal. I'm going out for a while. This is really tiring. If I wear this, I can't use magic. But I can survive with this item. You're Lord Momonga. Why did you come here without any guards? And you're wearing this outfit. Why am I exposed? No, only someone with the guild ring can teleport freely in Nazarick. Of course, I'll get exposed. I have some matters to attend to. Is that the case? This is really in line with a ruler's thinking. What? I just want to get a breath of fresh air outside. But I still can't let you leave without any guards. I'll allow you to come with me then. This is... A real sky? Fly. I can see things clearly from the stars and the moon's brilliance. It doesn't look like a real world. A blue planet. It looks like a shiny jewelry box. This world looks beautiful because of the gems used to decorate Lord Momonga. If it's your wish, we will use all the forces of Nazarick to obtain it for you. When it's not even clear what exists out there? But you're right. Conquering the world sounds pretty interesting. I'm sure it's impossible though. Anyway, am I really the only one who came from YGGDRASIL? I can't use Message to reach anyone, but it might be due to the far distance or something happened to its magical effect. Well then, I shall spread the name of Ainz Ooal Gown throughout the world. Warrior Captain Gazef. Vice Captain. Bring a few men and escort the survivors to E-Rantel. Warrior Captain. What's the matter? The king's order is to investigate the group attacking the border villages and to suppress them. You're right. But even if this place has the knights of Baharuth Empire, we only have 50 men. That's because this is a confidential task. It's the Nobility Faction, right? Even among the king's inner circle, they believe that if the most prestigious warrior gets defeated, they will have the power to denounce the king. How superficial. That's enough. You must've noticed it, Warrior Captain. This is a trap without a doubt. Instead of splitting up our troop and reducing our combat power, it's better if we all retreat to E-Rantel temporarily. Even if it means sacrificing a few villages, those losses are incomparable to losing you, the strongest warrior in the kingdom. I was born a commoner. So was I. Living in a village is like living next to death. There are also many attacks by monsters. Yes. Didn't you have expectations back then? Expecting the capable noblemen or adventurers to save you. To say that I didn't would be a lie. But nobody showed up. Well then, let's show them. The gesture of facing danger and sacrificing our lives to save others. The gesture of the strong helping the weak. As long as I understand how to use the Mirror of Remote Viewing, I can use it to build a security network for Nazarick's surroundings. Congratulations, Lord Momonga. Thank you, Sebas. Sorry for making you accompany me. Following my master and obeying his commands define the meaning of my existence as the head butler, as set by my creator, Lord Touch Me. Is that so? Well then, let's take a look at those people. Is it a festival? No, it isn't. They don't look like bandits. That's odd. If I were my old self before I came to this world, I'd faint at the sight of this scene. How can I stay calm now? What would you like to do? Leave them be. Yes, sir. Touch. I got the points. I need two more points to change my class. Let's finish him off quickly. A heteromorphic player. How gross. Why did you save a stranger? When someone is in trouble, helping them is the right thing to do. JUSTICE HAS ARRIVED Anyway, I should investigate my combat power in this world. Sebas. I'm going to this village. Raise Nazarick's alert level to the highest. Yes. Tell Albedo to come fully armed. After that, prepare a backup squad. Send a few soldiers who are proficient in secret operations or have the ability of invisibility. Yes, sir. Touch Me, I shall repay your kindness. Gate. Enri. Nemu. Run quickly, Enri! Run! Hurry and run! I must buy time for Nemu to run away. What's that? Grasp Heart. It's a necromancy-type magic I'm familiar with and it's one of the high-tier spells, a ninth-tier. If it doesn't work on the people of this world, I can only run away then. A monster? I felt nothing even though I killed him. Sure enough, it's not just the flesh. Is my soul no longer human? This is such a rare trip. Even though this is ruthless, let me experiment with you. Dragon Lightning. How weak. A mere fifth-tier spell could kill you. Create Mid-Tier Undead. Death Knight. It comes out straight from the corpse. It's really different from YGGDRASIL. Death Knight, kill all the knights who are attacking the village. As a shield monster, how could it leave the person it was supposed to protect? It was my command though. I'm very sorry. Preparation took me some time. No, you came at the right time, Albedo. Thank you very much. Well then... How should we deal with these inferior creatures? Our current enemy is actually there. The people wearing armor. Yes, sir. It seems you're injured. Drink this. Blood? I'll drink it, so please don't hurt-- Enri, don't do it! -What's this? -Nemu, shut up. -She doesn't trust me at all. -But... -Listen to me. -I wonder what's wrong. I beg you, don't do it! You're just inferior creatures. Hang on! Calm down, lower your weapon. Yes, sir. This is Minor Healing Potion. Drink it quickly. No way. Does it still hurt? No, it doesn't. Do your people know magic? Yes. A pharmacist, who is a friend of mine, sometimes comes to the village and uses magic. Is that so? That's good then. I'm a magic caster. Anti-Life Cocoon. Wall of Protection from Arrows. I cast protection spells on you. As long as you stay in there, you'll be safe. Other than that, I'll give you these just in case. If you blow them, the Goblin Troop will appear. They'll listen to you. Tell them to protect you. Excuse me. Thank you very much for saving us. Thank you very much. Don't worry about it. May I know your name? Name? Yes. That's right. Remember my name. I am... Ainz Ooal Gown. Damn it. He's only striking the fleeing people down. Is he enjoying this? God, please save us. God. Bastards! Stop that monster! I shouldn't die here. Buy some time for me! Be my human shield! Captain Belius. Money! I'll give you money. Two hundred gold coins! No, 500 gold coins. A thousand gold coins... Save me! I beg you! I'm willing to do anything! Money! I'll give you money! Money! No! God. Calm down! Fall back! Send a signal to call the cavalries. The remaining people will buy time. Let's begin. Death Knight, that's enough. I saved the villagers because I needed information. If I know nothing of this world, when I interact with the people in power or those stronger than me, it'll be my greatest weakness. The honest village chief and his wife believed me. They think that I'm a magic caster who studies magic at a faraway place and that I'm unfamiliar with the world. They told me everything they know about this world. But... Even though I'm wearing this mask that's obtainable by logging in to YGGDRASIL on Christmas Eve, known as the Mask of Envy, it's considered a cursed item to some extent. They don't think I'm suspicious. What kind of people are the magic casters in this world? This village, Carne Village and Nazarick are surrounded by the land of Re-Estize Kingdom. Across the huge mountain range that spans north and south, lies a neighboring country called Baharuth Empire. Adjacent to the borders of these two countries, the country in the south is called Slane Theocracy. The city closest to the village is called E-Rantel. Goblins, orcs, ogres, and other monsters appear around here. But adventurers hunt in this area. It's basically safe to walk along the street. Adventurers? They are people who destroy monsters based on how much the reward is. E-Rantel has the Adventurer's Guild that offers them missions. I see. Sure enough, I need to live on the street for a while. At this rate, the news of this figure, Ainz Ooal Gown, saving the villagers will spread. Other than me, if there are other players of YGGDRASIL in this world, it's best if we can form an alliance. Thus, I shouldn't make them dislike me. I must prevent unneeded bloodshed. I also have to be famous. It's best if I can find a country that can support me. Whatever. I've done everything here. Albedo, let's retreat. Yes, sir. What should we do, sir? Do you have any good ideas? Are they in a bind again? What's the matter, sir? Lord Ainz. A group of people dressed as knights is approaching the village. I'm Re-Estize Kingdom's Warrior Captain, Gazef Stronoff. By the king's order, we came to fight against the imperial knights who ransacked the surrounding areas. We're patrolling every village. The kingdom's Warrior Captain. You're the chief of this village, aren't you? Please tell me who the person next to you is. Nice to meet you, Warrior Captain. I'm Ainz Ooal Gown. I saw that this village was under attack. I'm a magic caster who came to help. You saved this village. I'm very grateful. Warrior Captain. There are many silhouettes closing in on this village from every corner. Captain of one of the Six Scriptures that worships the Six Great Gods, Nigun Grid Luin of Sunlight Scripture. Yes. Obliterate Re-Estize Kingdom's strongest warrior, Gazef Stronoff. This is a treasured item that contains a miracle of the Gods. If anything happens, just use it. Indeed. They've enclosed the entire village at equal intervals. Who the heck are they? The only country that can dispatch so many magic casters at once is Slane Theocracy. They're part of the special unit directly under the Cardinal. It must be one of the Six Scriptures. Then the people who attacked the villagers just now... The equipment they wore belongs to the empire. But it seems it was a disguise by Slane Theocracy. I see. Does this village have such great value? If you have no idea why they are attacking, then there's only one reason for them to come here. People are really envious of you, Warrior Captain. This is troublesome. I can't believe that Slane Theocracy wants my life. But I think those are Archangel Flames. Why do the same monsters in YGGDRASIL exist here too? My lord. Can I hire you? The pay is up to you. Please forgive me for refusing. I see. Well then, take care, my lord. Thank you again for saving this village. I'm really thankful. Please allow me to say these willful words. I hope you can protect the villagers again. Although I have nothing I can give you now, please lend a helping hand-- You don't have to go that far. I understand. I'll definitely protect the villagers. I swear on the name of Ainz Ooal Gown. I have no worries then. I just need to move forward bravely. Please bring this along. Since it's a gift from you, I shall accept it. Farewell. May you win your battles. When I first met the humans here, I thought they were nothing more than just insects. But as we talked, I grew fond of them as I came to see them as small animals. Is that why you used your name to make a promise with him? Maybe that's the case. Assault the enemy! Break through their envelopment. Lure all the enemies away from the village. After that, fall back. Don't miss the opportunity. -Yes, captain! -Yes, captain! Let's go. Rip them apart. Warrior Captain. I see. Martial Arts. Focus Battle Aura. Magic is really powerful. Bastard. But this is exactly as we planned. My lord, I'm counting on you. -Let's live and die with Warrior Captain! -Let's protect our country and the people! Didn't I tell you to retreat after luring all the enemies? What a bunch of idiots. All of you are making me proud. We have an overwhelming disadvantage when it comes to combat power. Then, the target is the commander! Get out of the way! Martial Arts. Sixfold Slash of Light. Martial Arts. Instant Counter. Flow Acceleration. It worked. We can win! How interesting. You can actually use so many Martial Arts techniques skillfully. But that's all. Summon the next angel. Focus on attacking Stronoff with magic. This is bad. Enri. It's okay, Nemu. Finish him off. But one isn't enough. Be on the safe side and send multiple angels at once. Don't underestimate me! I'm the Kingdom's Warrior Captain. I am one who loves and protects this country. I'll never lose to people like you who taint this country! It's because you always daydream that you're going to die here, Gazef Stronoff. What can you do with those injuries? After I kill you, I'll kill all the villagers. Stop struggling unnecessarily. Lie down obediently. I'll show you one last act of compassion and let you die painlessly. It's almost time for us to switch places. Where's this place? This is the village's warehouse. Lord Ainz used magic to cast a protection spell. Where's he? It's as if he swapped positions with you. He suddenly disappeared. I see. Who are you? Nice to meet you, people from Slane Theocracy. My name is Ainz Ooal Gown. Please call me Ainz. I have a bit of a relationship with that village. Are you here to beg for mercy on behalf of the villagers? No. Actually, I heard your conversation with the Warrior Captain. You're pretty brave. How dare you say you want to kill the villagers that I've bothered saving. There's nothing more unpleasant than this. You actually said "unpleasant." You talk big, magic caster. So, what about it? Don't resist and offer me your life. If you do that, you won't suffer. But if you refuse, you'll pay for your own stupidity. Die in despair and pain. Let the angels assault him! How unsightly. Saying these boring and boastful words to bluff us... I already said this. Don't resist and offer me your life. You should accept kind advice with humility. -Impossible. -He must've played a trick. Body of Effulgent Aquamarine. It can completely neutralize the attacks of a small number of weapons and low-level monsters. It's a passive skill. I want to know why you people can use the same magic and summon the same monsters in YGGDRASIL. Never mind, let's put this aside first. It's my turn now. I'm coming to annihilate you. Let all the angels attack at once. Now! Albedo, step back. Yes. Negative Burst! It's impossible. -Holy Ray! -Fireball! -Poison! -Fear! -Emerald Sarcophagus! -Open Wounds! Those spells really are from YGGDRASIL. Who taught you these spells? What happened? Albedo. You should know that kind of projectile item can't hurt me. Do not use your strength-- Hang on, Lord Ainz. To fight against Ruler of Supreme Beings, they should at least use a decent attack, unlike that cheap iron ball. If you were to say so, these guys aren't up to the standard then. Am I right? Principality Observation, attack! Good grief. Shall I start fighting back then? Hell Flame. It only took one hit? How's that possible? A high-ranked angel can't be defeated with one spell! Captain Nigun, what should we do? Summon the highest-ranked angel. That's... a Sealing Crystal. Do they also have items from YGGDRASIL? Albedo, use your skills to protect me. Yes. Look, the noble figure of the highest-ranked angel, Dominion Authority! Is this angel your biggest trump card? That's right. I think dealing with you using this treasured item is worth it. How's this possible? How boring. What? I actually watched out for this kind of child's play? Child's play? What are you saying? Could it be... No, it's impossible! In front of an invincible existence mankind can't defeat... You're bluffing! Unleash Holy Smite! A seventh-tier spell, a realm that humans can never reach. The power that can even destroy demons. Take this! Is this the feeling of pain from obtaining damage? Inferior... Inferior creatures! Lord Ainz. How dare you make the person I like the most, my most beloved person, feel pain! You're a bunch of trash who don't know their place! Let it go, Albedo. But Lord Ainz... It's okay. Except for the fact that the angel is too weak, everything is within my grasp. It's my turn now. Experience despair. Black Hole. A power that surpasses demons? Who the heck are you? Ainz Ooal Gown. This name was once so famous that everybody knew of it. Let's finish this game. Hang on! Please wait for a while, Ainz Ooal Gown! No, my lord! We... No, it's fine if it's just me. Can you let me go? I can give you all the money you want. It seems that you misunderstood. As humans, the inferior creatures, you should lower your head and wait for the moment of your death with a thankful heart. Inferior creatures? If I'm not mistaken, this is what you said, "Stop struggling unnecessarily. Lie down obediently. I'll show you one last act of compassion and let you die painlessly." My actions... As the master of Nazarick, I wonder if they are up to the standard. Gosh, Lord Ainz. That's too cool. What's the matter, Albedo? No, it's nothing. But why did you save that human, Lord Ainz? You also gifted a precious item to him. That was just a 500-yen consolation prize from the in-game lucky draw. Wouldn't it have been easier if you'd let me wipe them out? I'm fully aware of your strength, and I also trust you. But we don't have any knowledge of this world yet. Always keep in mind that the enemies might surpass us. That's why you used that man as a sacrificial piece. Indeed, this is the correct way of using humans. But taking on the angels' swords might not have been the best course of action. Is that so? Even though you knew you wouldn't get hurt, which woman in this world could tolerate her beloved getting stabbed by blades? I see. Let's go home. Return to our home. Yes, Lord Ainz. First of all, I apologize for taking actions on my own. You can ask Albedo about what happened. I have something to notify everyone urgently. Greater Break Item. I've changed my name. From now on, my name is Ainz Ooal Gown. You shall call me Ainz. Anyone who has any objections may step forward. We shall remember your honorable name. We swear absolute loyalty to the Ruler of Supreme Beings. Long live Lord Ainz Ooal Gown! -Long live Lord Ainz Ooal Gown! -Long live Lord Ainz Ooal Gown! We shall offer everything to the Supreme One. -The one who owns the supreme power. -The one who owns the supreme power. Every creature of this world shall know of your greatness. Our king who surpasses everything. May glory shine on the Overlord, the ruler of death. I'm giving all of you a command. Let Ainz Ooal Gown become an everlasting legend! Be it on land, the sky, or in the sea, let all intelligent life forms in this world know this name, Ainz Ooal Gown. I hope to convey this name to my companions who may come to this world. Demiurge. Tell everyone what Lord Ainz said to you. While enjoying the night sky, Lord Ainz said, "Maybe I came to this land to get this jewelry box that doesn't belong to others." In the end, he said, "Conquering the world sounds pretty interesting." Everyone, the final goal of the Great Tomb of Nazarick is to dedicate the jewelry box as an offering from this world to Lord Ainz. FORTRESS CITY, E-RANTEL Is this the fortress city, E-Rantel? Lord Ainz. What are we going to do here? We want to create another identity as famous adventurers in this city. We're now at the lowest rank, which is Copper. After accumulating achievements, we'll get Mithril or Orichalcum rank, or maybe the highest rank, Adamantite rank. The useful information we can get will increase too. I expect nothing less from Lord Ainz. You're wrong. In this city, my name is Momon. You're also not Narberal Gamma, the combat maid from Pleiades. You're Nabe. That was rude of me, Lord Momon. It's just Momon. Drop the honorific. We're ordinary adventurers and companions. Understood, Momon... All right, that's fine. Accommodation, right? Room sharing is five copper coins per day. Meals-- I want a room for two. We don't need meals. You're Copper-ranked, right? Then-- We just came from registering at the guild. Seven copper coins per day. Paid in advance. Sure. The room is at the end of the second floor. Good grief. Hey. That hurts a lot. How are you going to compensate me? It seems that you have to let the woman over there serve me well. Sorry, please forgive me. What a standard line from small fry. I couldn't hold back my laughter. I don't even have to exert any strength to deal with you. So? What will you do next? Wasting time is stupid. How about-- Hey! What have you done? My potion broke because of you! You must compensate me! Potion? I... I skipped meals and quit drinking. The money I saved from living frugally for today... The potion I just bought today was broken by you! You should let them compensate you then. One gold coin and ten silver coins. You guys have been drinking here. You guys can't afford it, can you? You. Wearing such an imposing armor... You must have healing potions, right? You can compensate with items too. I have it. Hang on. I know. A red-colored potion? This should do it, right? Yes. I guess so. Welcome to the shop. Nfirea Bareare? Yes, do you need anything? I need your help to identify something. E-RANTEL, ADVENTURER'S GUILD Hey. That armor looks really amazing. How much does it cost? He's just Copper-ranked. He must be some family's young master. Was it a present from your dad? I can't read it. Narberal is also illiterate. I want to take this mission. I'm very sorry. This is a quest for Mithril-ranked adventurers. I understand. That's why I took it. But this is our rule. My companion can use third-tier spells and above. Third-tier? At that young age? I'm also a warrior who's on the same level as her. We wish to perform jobs where the difficulty matches our strength. I'm very sorry. This is our rule. I can't go against it. Is that so? It can't be helped then. Sorry for these willful words. Please give me the toughest job for Copper rank then. Yes, I understand. Yes, I convinced her. If that is the case, would you like to work with us? I'd like to introduce myself. I'm the leader of Swords of Darkness, Peter Mauk. He's the eyes and ears of our group, the ranger, Lukrut Volve. This is a druid who uses healing magic and natural magic, Dyne Woodwonder. It's my pleasure. Lastly, the magic caster, our team's strategist, Ninya the Spell Caster. Let's work hard together. By the way, Peter. Can you stop calling me by that embarrassing nickname? Why not? This guy has talent. Talent? It's a kind of innate ability one may possess in this world. His talent is called Magic Aptitude. It takes you four years to learn magic that normally takes eight, right? That's really amazing. It's a blessing to have this innate ability. I can take my first step towards achieving my dream with it. No matter what, he's a famous Talent User in this city. But there's someone more famous than me. The Bareare family. The guy's name is Nfirea Bareare, the grandson of a famous pharmacist. His talent allows him to equip and use any magical item without any restrictions. -That human might be very dangerous. -I know. Anyway, our job revolves around hunting monsters that appear around E-Rantel. Monster extermination? Based on the strength of the monsters we defeated, the city will pay us accordingly through the guild. That's our reward this time. I see. It's like hunting for item drops. How about it? Would you two be willing to assist us? Sure, we'll be in your care. We're done with the preparations. Let's go now. Yes. Momon. Someone has asked for you. Who is it? It's Nfirea Bareare. Don't act without thinking. I'm very sorry. Watch out next time. Nice to meet you. I was the one who requested for you. I'm very sorry. I've already accepted another job. Your request is such an honor. Momon, that is a designated request! Even though that's the case, isn't it right to give priority to the work I accepted first? But it's rare to be personally requested. Then how about this? Let's listen to Nfirea's quest before we decide. I'm Nfirea Bareare, a pharmacist in this town. To gather herbs this time, I'm going to a forest in Carne Village. Carne Village? So, I hope you can escort me there and help me with my herb gathering. Escort? That's a bit troublesome. I don't have skills that can protect others. -Your reward-- -Peter. Are you willing to get hired by me? What do you mean? An escort mission needs a ranger like Lukrut. For herb gathering in the forest, having a druid like Dyne will be more efficient. Momon's discernment is outstanding. I'm totally down for it. Thank you for your invitation. I'm fine with that too. That's great. Lastly, may I ask a question? Yes. Why me? I came to this city yesterday. I don't have any good friends. Not only that, nobody knows me. But you requested for me. Why? Actually, I heard about the inn incident. The inn incident? Yes, the customer who came into my store said you knocked down higher-ranked adventurers instantly. Coincidentally, the person I've always requested for went to another city. This is a rare chance, so I want to find a new adventurer. Besides, hiring a Copper-ranked adventurer is cheaper. Indeed. Do you have any more questions? Nope, we can go at any moment now. -I don't think it's possible, but... -Understood. Let's get going then. Albedo. What are you doing in Lord Ainz's bedroom? When Lord Ainz returns, I want him to be enveloped in my scent. Lord Ainz is undead. He doesn't need sleep. Handle yourself appropriately. I don't know what you mean. But I understand. Right, Lord Ainz? That's... A body pillow? Yes, I made it myself. I'm still knitting other things like socks and clothes for our future children. I've already made enough to last until they reach the age of five. It doesn't matter if it's a boy or a girl. What if the child is a hermaphrodite or sexless? It seems the Supreme Beings will dress boys like girls. Oh, my! This is really good news. Thank you, Demiurge. -How should I design it? -You're welcome. Peter. Yes? Why don't we take a break there? Good idea. Momon. Understood. Momon. It gets dangerous if we go further ahead. Understood, I'll be on alert. I remember this area is the territory of the Wise King of the Forest. The Wise King of the Forest? It's a monster that has lived for hundreds of years. It possesses incredible power. Legend has it that it's a four-legged silver-white monster with a snake's tail. Extremely wise, it can use magic too. I really... want to see it. Nabe, you maintain a calm attitude all this while. Is it because you trust my eyes and ears? It's not because of you. It's because Momon is here. Hey, are you two lovers? Lovers? What are you saying? How could it be me? -There's Ms. Albedo-- -Hang on, what are you saying? Lukrut. Could you please drop the topic? It was rude of me. It seems Momon already has a partner. Momon, I apologize for my companion's behavior. It's not good to pry into other's personal affairs. It's fine. As long as he's careful in the future, I don't mind. Lukrut, it's almost time for you-- They are on the move. Where? They are right there. It seems a battle is unavoidable. Nfirea, please hide in the carriage. Okay, I'm counting on all of you. Momon, how do we divide the work? Everyone, please protect Nfirea. After that, watch how easily I deal with them. Understood. But we will also try our best to support you. If we start the battle here, they might run away into the forest. Let's use our old method then. It's just like making a turtle stick its head out. We'll go by that then. By the way, Peter, Momon will stop the enemy's assault, but what if an enemy breaks through? I'll fight off the ogres by using my Martial Arts, Fortress. Dyne will handle the goblins. Understood. Ninya will cast protection spells on me. Then he'll use magic attacks according to the battle situation. Yes, understood. Lukrut is responsible for hunting goblins. Stop the ogres if they break through. Leave it to me. Momon, do you think this is okay? Yes. First of all... They took the bait. Reinforce Armor. Twine Plant. Amazing. That's higher than Mithril rank. Is it Orichalcum rank? No, could it be Adamantite rank? What's wrong? Aren't you coming at us? All right, the remaining are... They are heading here! Take this! Magic Arrow! They are coming. Let's fight them. What a great party. They know each other's abilities. They have great teamwork too. But they aren't as good as my past companions. Nabe, go. Yes. Lightning. -Run! -Run! Stop! I won't let you run away! Light Healing. It hurts. What are you doing? Cut a part of the fallen monster like this and give it to the guild. Then, we can claim our reward. Don't they drop crystals or similar items? I've never heard about ogres carrying crystals. I see. By the way, why did you choose the name, Swords of Darkness? Well... Among the Thirteen Heroes, the Black Knight possessed four swords which are known as Swords of Darkness. Finding those swords is our ultimate goal. Before we get the real deal, this is our symbol. Nothing is real or fake. This is undoubtedly a symbol of our team. Lukrut finally said something nice. Hey, that's horrible! We must praise him occasionally. You guys are bullying me! I used to be like that too. -I'm saying something good, you know! -We went to adventures, gathered materials, and established Nazarick together. Do all adventurers get along like you guys? Yes, because we go through near-death situations together. Besides, our team only has men. I heard that fights arise whenever there's a woman in a team. Besides, the goal of our team is rather clear. Whether all the team members are on the same page or not shows a big difference. Do you have a team too, Momon? We were not adventurers though. I was once weak and alone. A paladin in white armor saved me. Through him, I met people who I could call companions for the first time. They were wonderful companions and also my good friends. I'll never forget the days I spent with them. Ainz Ooal Gown. My everything. Momon. One day, you can still meet those people who you used to fight with side by side. Such a day won't exist. Excuse me. Nabe, I'm going there to eat. I'm coming too. I see. It seems I've said something I shouldn't have. Something must've happened. I guess his team was wiped out. People who lost their companions in battle have this kind of atmosphere. It must be hard for him. You can't take back what you said. So you must take action to make up for the rudeness of your words. I'll do that. I know how painful it is for someone to be taken away from you. Why didn't I consider it? Tuareninya. E-RANTEL CEMETERY Let's see. I'm coming in. Hello. I'm here to find Khajiit. Are you there? Don't give greetings like that. It taints the glorious name of Zurrernorn. Anyway, what do you need, Clementine? I brought this for you. That's the sacred treasure of the Shaman Princess, the Crown of Wisdom. It's one of Slane Theocracy's most precious treasures. That's right. A cute girl was wearing this weird thing. After I snatched it away, she went crazy. You're also a member of the Black Scripture. This item seals off the wearer's self-consciousness to turn human into an item that activates high-tier magic spells. It's impossible that you don't know the consequence of taking it forcefully from the Shaman Princess. I guess so. Besides, this item only suits one out of a million people. If nobody can use it, it's nothing but trash. So, as the executive of the secret society, Zurrernorn, should we join forces? Join forces? I heard this city has a Talent User who can use any item. That person can probably use this item. Kidnapping one person. Can't you handle it by yourself? When I make my move, I want to create a big commotion too. Is it for you to run away amid the chaos? Coincidentally, I'm done with my preparations here. Is that the Orb of Death? That's right. I'll use this to turn E-Rantel into a city of the dead where undead roam freely. The magic ritual of harvesting the overwhelming negative energy, Death Spiral. By doing that, I will be immortal. I'll help you finish the ritual. What do you think? It's a great deal, right? I failed. Momon. I'm very sorry about last night. Although my body is an undead, my spirit has also changed. Is that why? The view here is great. We don't have to maintain our formation. Being on alert is important. That's right, we can't underestimate our enemies. Maybe a dragon would suddenly attack. Something like that wouldn't normally happen, right, Ninya? I heard the suburbs of E-Rantel had a dragon that could freely manipulate the world. Besides, to the north of Azerlisia Mountains over there, I heard that there were a few living Frost Dragons. Do you know the name of the dragon that can manipulate the world? I don't know that. I'll look it up after I return to the city. Sure. I'm counting on you, Ninya. Understood, Momon. We'll reach Carne Village soon. Dragon is also the strongest race in YGGDRASIL. If they exist in this world, I must be on my guard. What? That's odd. What's the matter? That strong-looking fence wasn't there before. Hey. Call Enri now. Aren't those goblins? Who are you people? Please put down your weapons. These guys are... Hey, my fellow brothers. We want to avoid fighting as much as possible, especially that guy in armor. You give off a bad vibe. It's way too obvious. What's with these guys? Goblin, what's the matter? Enri. Enri! Nfirea! Sure enough, these are the goblins summoned from the horn flutes I gave her. But... A pharmacist, who is a friend of mine, sometimes comes to the village and uses magic. -Long time no see. How are you? -So the person you meant was him. Well then, we're entering the forest. I'm counting on all of you. Momon is here. You'll be fine. Hey, Momon. If the Wise King of the Forest shows up, instead of killing it, can you chase it away? Why? Carne Village was never attacked by monsters because it's the territory of the Wise King of the Forest. If you defeat him... But that's impossible, right? Understood. The opponent is a legendary monster who has lived for hundreds of years. This is how a truly powerful being should be. Hey, Momon. Can I ask you something? What's the matter? I heard from Enri that someone called Ainz Ooal Gown saved the village. And he used a red-colored potion to save her life. The red-colored potion you gave to the lady at the inn is a rare item that can't be made through ordinary methods. And the name Albedo... Momon, you're Ainz Ooal Gown, right? I think you must have your reason for hiding your name. I just want to thank you for saving Enri. Lift your head up. I'm now a normal adventurer called Momon. I hope you won't forget this. Yes, I won't tell anyone. Lord Ainz, I'm really sorry. Lift your head up. It's your mistake for mentioning Albedo's name. But it's okay. Anyway, there's something we must do. And that is... Defeat the Wise King of the Forest. I instructed Aura in advance to drive out the Wise King of the Forest which is lurking in the forest. It's to improve my reputation. I originally wanted it. But since it's Lord Ainz's order, it can't be helped. My job here is done! This is bad. A behemoth is heading this way. Is it the Wise King of the Forest? Leave everything to us. I'm counting on you. I'm counting on you two. Momon. What's the matter? Please don't push yourself too hard. Yes, leave the forest quickly. I said all that, but without a witness, how would anyone know if it was the Wise King of the Forest? Should I cut one of its legs? Our guest is here. You were able to completely block my first attack. How wonderful. "Wonderful"? Now, trespassers of my territory, if you run away now, based on your excellent defense, I won't hunt you down. What do you plan to do? What a foolish question. Anyway, why won't you show yourself? Are you not confident? Or are you shy? You're quite good with words. Let the glory of mine stun you and brew fear in you. You're actually... I can feel the consternation and fear from you under your helmet. I have a question for you. You are... of the Djungarian Hamster race, right? What? You know my race? Well, yes. More like, my former companion had a pet that resembled you. I see. If you meet another of the same race, please do tell me. It's a shame if a creature can't breed and make offspring. No, that's... In terms of size, it won’t work. Is that so? What a shame. I'm sorry. It's fine. Anyway, that's all for our chitchat. Let's go all out and kill each other. Nabe, step back. I don't mind if you two attack together. Two people dealing with a hamster? I can't do something so shameful. I'm coming then. Darn it. You're doing great. You can use magic too? Low-tier magic and spiritual magic won't work on me. Your fur isn't ordinary. Well then... Both of us got hit once. How interesting. You must be a famous warrior, right? Warrior? No, could you be a knight? You can't even tell that I'm undead. The Wise King of the Forest? I was looking forward to it because of its name. This is no good. This won't work at all. What are you doing? Could it be that you're surrendering before the outcome is decided? Hurry up. Come and fight me seriously. Fight for your life! This is enough. Skill. Despair Aura. Level 1. I surrender. I lost. It's still a monster after all. Do you want to kill it? I'd like to skin it. The texture feels nice. No way. This is... -the Wise King of the Forest? -The Wise King of the Forest? Don't worry. I already tamed it. It won't lose control. Exactly as Master said. I, the Wise King of the Forest, will serve Master and fight alongside him. I won't cause trouble to you all. Incredible. What a great magical monster! I can feel its strong power and intelligence. Strong power? Intelligence? He accomplished such a great feat. I expect nothing less from the person who brings Nabe on an adventure. If it were us, we would have been wiped out! I expect nothing less from Momon. You're awesome. Nabe, what do you think? Its strength is another issue. I can really feel the power from its eyes. No way. Well then, Momon, we're going to Nfirea's house first and unload the goods. Understood. I'll come after I register the monster at the guild. All thanks to Momon, I had a rewarding harvest. I'll prepare an additional payment for you. The harvest was because of my assistance-- Goodbye. Nabe, this is a temporary farewell. Don't feel lonely. Let's have a party after this. You flea, I'm going to step on you. Move it. Well, I'll see you. Should I hold my head up high? I look like a middle-aged man sitting on a carousel. This is so embarrassing. Damn it. Right, I need to give this guy a name. Hamsuke... No, Daifuku is fine too. Okay, everyone. Can you move them here? Understood. Is Grandma not home? Welcome home. Subtitle translation by Michelle Chai
