Hot diggity dog! Yeehaw, we're rich! Silver coins, my butt! It's the old washers in the money bag trick again! Come on, now. What are you doing, Lee Bob? Just in case. Ah, ah! Ahhh! Hey, Brady! I didn't catch you with your pants down, did I? Lute! Easy come, easy go. Face it, Hawkes, I'm the better poker player and I'm going to that game in San Francisco! Lute! That's my money! Cantrell! So that's where he had it. Let's go. You sure you're up to this, Burgundy? I'd feel a lot better if I had my own clothes on. You want to be there just as bad as he does, don't you? Let me tell you something, Ethan. Hawkes did right by going on ahead of us. What if I'd up and left with him? Wouldn't be the first time I was out on my own. In a way, Hawkes and I are cut from the same blanket. This could be our last chance at the big score. We got to go for it.. Dammit, Henry, I told you not to bring that horse in here anymore! Just one beer, George, and I swear I'm on my way. Yeah, all right, one more. Then you're outta here. Well, that's what they call ambience. Oh! Oh! Oh. Easy come, easy go. Did you have to shoot my motorcycle? Shut up. I could crush you like a wormy apple. But I won't. Boys, let him know how lucky he is. Come on. I told you he tied that rope too high. Well, we got him, didn't we? Look at that. Someone's in trouble, we'd better help. Come on. Come on! Wait a minute! Where's my actor? Cut it, cut it! Hold it! Cut it! Cut it! Mark! Mark! Yes, Sir? They've sent us another actor over here that can't even ride! Well, they all say they can't wear the mask and ride at the same time. Well, that doesn't make any difference! The sun is out! Ethan? Mark McCain! How you doing? How are ya? How you doing? Wait a minute, you both know each other? Why, sure. Ethan's partnered with one of my pa's best friends. Hey, Brady said your pa really helped him down in Juarez. Yeah, I heard about that. Well, what do you know about that? Oh, uh, D.W., this is Ethan Cassidy. Howdy-do, Sir. Honored, Sir. Happy to know you. Say, you making one of those moving pictures here? Yes, you might say we're making one of those moving pictures. Hey, you ride real great. We need great new cowboys. This is a brand new business. You could make a fortune in this game, son. Well, that's an honor, Sir, and I appreciate it, but I'm on my way to San Francisco there with Miss Burgundy Jones, so. Heck, Mark here's a better hand than I could ever be anyway. Well, we want to thank you, the both of you, anyway. Thanks a lot. Thanks for saving Silver here, he's very valuable. Have a nice trip! Alan. Mark. Yes, Sir? Put on the mask. Put it on. You mean.. Yes, I mean put on the mask! Sir! Put it on, we have go, the sun's out! Sir, yes, Sir. Original positions, let's go! Let's go! All right, everybody, original positions! You Indians back there, stay Indians! All right! Let's go! All ready? Number one position! Am I in my position? I got a plan for you. Bath, dear? Ah! I could do this every day for the rest of my life. Why don't you shut up and pass me that tequila? You're a humorless stump, you know that, Elroy? Stump? You calling me a stump? Yeah. Get outta the tub, you skinny twig! Twig? That's right. You calling me a twig? Get outta the tub! All right. You're gonna pay for this! Lee Bob, I'm gonna teach you a lesson you won't soon forget. Hold this. Let go of me! You started it! All right! All right, you're asking for it now, boy. I'll tell you what! Here we are surrounded by beautiful muchachas and you two can't keep your hands off each other? I oughta kill you both just for being two big dumb redneck peckerwoods. (Foreign language) Tequila. Have a seat. Uh... Por que your name? No, Sir. Hold onto that thought. Where are you going now, Lee Bob? Uh, me and my supper are about to part company. Takes a real hombre to hold his liquor and hold his women. Sorry, boys, just passing through! Keep your seat, keep your seat! Ow! Catch him! Kill him! Get off of me! Hey! Woo! Get off of me! Psst! Oh! He's getting away! He doesn't even have the money, you idiots! Hey, hey! Hey! Well, Ethan Cassidy, I'll be damned. Long time no see, boys. Hey, Ethan, what brings you here? I'm on my way to San Francisco. How come you guys are off the range? Ah, we quit that sorry outfit a long time ago. We're putting on rodeos now. This is all ours, it's our stock. That's great! Excuse me, boys. Look at him work, huh? Just gets better and better. Yeah. If there's a better horse trainer around, I don't believe I've met him. Hello, Doug. Oh, Miss Burgundy. Well! How you doing, Miss Burgundy? Fine. You two know each other? You bet we do. How you feeling, Ethan? I'm feeling pretty good. Why? 'Cause I just entered you in the saddle bronc riding and you better win. Now, hold on, I'm no bronc rider. You are today. I spent every last penny we had to enter you. Woo-ee! Well, we brought a rough bunch of broncs. Good luck, cowboy. Now, why'd you go do a fool thing like that for? 'Cause we don't have a choice. Now, you get out there and ride that bronc. It's about time you started pulling your own weight in this outfit. Hyah, hyah! Come here, hyah! Besides, if you don't win, we're not gonna have enough money to get to San Francisco. Well, if I'm gonna climb up on a wild horse, I'm gonna wet my whistle and loosen up my joints. Yeah, you go do that. Yeah. Ladies and gentlemen of the press, it is my pleasure to introduce to you Mr. Diamond Jim Brady! Diamond Jim, Sir, what brings you to Leadville? Diamond Jim, right here. Ladies and gentlemen, I'm on my way to Virginia City, Nevada, where I personally will be involved in promoting the world championship heavyweight prizefight between Gentleman Jim Corbett and the legendary, the Boston strongman himself, John L. Sullivan. First fight of its kind anywhere in the world! A fight where gloves will be used instead of bare knuckles. For the first time to be held under the rules of the respectable and famous Marquess of Queensbury.. It's her! The Tennessee farm girl, Melody O'Rourke! Gentlemen, I'm not through yet. See you later, Diamond Jim. Good luck in Virginia City, Mr. Brady. Yes? Who is that woman? Temperance lady. Hottest preacher on the circuit since Billy Sunday. I told you we shouldn't have stopped in this one horse town. Who is financing this movement? Diamond Jim. Burgundy Jones from Oklahoma Territory. How do you do? This day is definitely looking up. Hey, Mister, you want to buy some firecrackers? What in the world would I want with firecrackers? How about a watch? No, I don't want to buy a watch. Now, go away, son, you're bothering me. Then how about pinching some pennies? You any good? Yes, Sir, that's how I make my living. I could use a kid like you. Dang it! Ethan! There you are. Hell, this is your lucky day. It's his lucky day, isn't it? Yeah. How do you figure that? Well, you drew Widowmaker. Widowmaker? That doesn't sound so good. No, it's good. And it's bad. Mm. It's good 'cause you can score real high on a horse like Widowmaker. It's bad 'cause no one has ever actually scored on him. Now, he'll come flying outta there a-kickin' and then he'll duck back on you and if you ain't ready, he'll drive your head right into the ground. Then he'll rear back and jump up and down on you. If I didn't know better, I'd think he actually enjoys it. I believe he does. He's a rank one, all right. He almost killed that fellow in Laramie, didn't he? Yeah, he sure did. Well, can I buy you guys um... Bartender, I may need a little help. Bartender, let me have a beer, please. My friends, today liquor will flow in Leadville, but not in this tent. Today we shall flood the streets with the devil's drink! What you need is a good man to keep you out of trouble, miss goody-two-shoes. The name is Melody O'Rourke. Whoa, whoa! Hold that. Young lady, I know you mean well, but my partner did that to you for your own good. It's just not a good idea to get between these cowboys and their refreshments on a national holiday. Any day is a good day for redemption, Sir, and I'll thank you to untie me. Boys, this is Melody O'Rourke. Temperance lady. I knew that. Oh, well, we'll leave her to you, then, Ethan. Though I expect you'll have better luck on Widowmaker. Better luck on Widowmaker. I'm very flattered you remembered me, Mr. Cassidy. That was very gallant, the way you rescued me. Yes, Ma'am. What's this Ma'am business? You know my name's Melody. Miss O'Rourke, I thought we had an agreement. You can do all the damn preaching you want, but no shenanigans with the ax. Sometimes I just get plumb carried away. Well, I'm gonna have to ask you to come along with me now. I hope to see you again, Ethan. That'd be nice, Melody. You're wasting your time, cowboy. This one don't like men. Oh, I like men, I just don't like you. And you can take that personally. Come on, Miss O'Rourke, you've caused enough trouble for one day. Let's go, ladies! Fear these words! Ah, shut up. Let 'em ride! Hang on, Saul! Nice ride, cowboy! He scored an 82, not bad! How 'bout that? That didn't look so bad. Here. Put these on. They'll help. $5000 in prize money to be split evenly between four events. That's not bad wages for only 10 seconds work. Hey, Lute, bet the ranch on Widowmaker. He's never been ridden. Widowmaker, huh? You'll go far, Kid. See what else you can find out. Next up is Ethan Cassidy from... Where are you from, Ethan? Montana, Big Horn, Montana. Big Horn Montana! Folks, he's gonna need a big horn 'cause he's up on Widowmaker! Good luck, cowboy! Hang in there, Ethan! Looks like he's earning his money while he's still in the chute! Boys, I got $500 says that cowboy can't ride old Widowmaker there. I'll take that bet. Hiya, Hawkes. That's it, son, just take your time! Get everything just right! Now, now, Brady, just take it easy. Hey, I didn't steal your money. You didn't steal my money? No. No, I sure didn't. I need my money. All right, now. He did it! He did it! Ethan Cassidy has ridden Widowmaker! Well, that's another $500 you owe me. Where's my money? Hey, whoa! Whoa! He's fallen off! Come on and help that cowboy! Go ahead. I'll just wait here for you. The foot, get the foot! Get his foot loose. You okay? Yeah. Widowmaker is a great name for that horse, isn't it? A great horse for that name. Thought you were on your way to San Francisco. I am. So is Lute Cantrell. He's got our money. Damn! You know, when you left us back there, I didn't care if I ever saw you again. But I gotta admit, you looked pretty good coming off of that fence. Hey, thanks for coming back. Well, look at this. Brady. Glad to have you back. Brady? Brady Hawkes? It's certainly a pleasure to meet a man of your legendary skills. Diamond Jim has graciously offered Ethan and me a ride to Virginia City. I'm promoting the biggest prize fight of the century. It'd be my pleasure to have you join us. Well, I'm not sure we'll have time to enjoy that event. But we certainly appreciate the ride to Virginia City and then we can catch the train on to San Francisco. My man has established a camp just outside of town. I'm not fond of these small town hotels. It would be my pleasure to have you join us for dinner. Sure. Brady, I want you to see my new coach. Just had it shipped in from Washington. They say Teddy Roosevelt rode in it once. Not that I believe that. So where have you been? And where'd you get that outfit? Give a lady some credit. This ain't my first rodeo. By the way, you won. That's good. Because Lute stole our stake. Don't talk to me about sin. I don't want to see you in this town anymore. Young lady! Young lady, I told you there'd be trouble. I know you have a mission, but cowboys will be boys. I've tangled with the devil before, Sir. Well, why don't you do it in somebody else's town? Come on! Come on, Ladies, get on that wagon before somebody gets hurt. Gents, we'll hitch up these ladies' wagons. Could they ride along with you? They could sure use an escort. Bring 'em along, the more the merrier. Always room for a fair maiden. Miss Burgundy. That two-wheeled rat is firing at us! That's all right, boys. I don't think we're in much jeopardy. Let's go get him. He's uh... He's a little better shot than we thought. Where is he? I can't see him. Ah, what the hell. Adios, boys! All right, which one of you fellas am I riding with? Nobody. We can't make time doubled up. Well, you can't expect me to walk! 'Cause I ain't walking out here in the middle of nowhere! No, Sir, I don't think so. That's right, I don't think. But I will. In fact, I think I'll start walking. Maybe even running. I'm feeling pretty frisky. Feeling real good. Legs moving good, yes, Sir. Okay, cowboy, hit it! Keep it going, cowboy! Come on, come on, keep it going! Yeah, woo! Hey! Ow! Get your grimy mitts off of them rolls, Sailor. One of these times, Cookie, I'm gonna stick that spatula in your gizzard. Yeah, well, until you do, you just stay away from my tent! Go on! Ooh! I would love to give that fool a whiff of gun smoke. Run his maverick butt right off of this wagon train. 'Course, he's probably already wanted dead or alive by some lawman. I wish Diamond Jim'd get rid of him, settle down in some big valley, build a little house in the prairie surrounded by high chaparral. Oh, that'd be a real bonanza for me. I'm getting too old for this wild, wild west. Hell. Oh! Better get them dogies rolling before these steaks start turning into rawhide. Ooh, Cookie, you certainly have done yourself proud this evening. Thank you, Ma'am. It must have cost a fortune. I'm a great believer in beefsteak. I don't believe a working man can live without it. Cookie, you look so familiar to me. Did you used to be with a cattle outfit? Things got too rowdy with that wild bunch. The truth is, Diamond Jim made him a better offer. Well, that, too, Ma'am. That, too. Enjoy your meal. Cassidy, you sure you won't change your mind and come join us? Well, I appreciate the offer, Diamond Jim, but evening's coming on and those ladies are camped out alone, so I think I'll just go over and check on 'em. Well, give them my regards. I believe your young man is smitten. He's always had an eye for the ladies. Miss Burgundy, what business are you in that brings you an association with Mr. Hawkes? Are you a gambler also? All women are gamblers whether they know it or not. And in this case, I know it. And I'm backing Mr. Hawkes in the last legal poker game in this country. Oh, yes, the one in San Francisco. High stakes, as I recall. It's a shame I can't figure a way to promote it, but poker's not a spectator sport. Truly the excitement of the game is in the playing, not the watching. Perhaps after supper you gentlemen would care to play a few hands? Well, if Mr. Hawkes wouldn't mind playing a game with an amateur. It'd be my pleasure. As your business manager, I think I should remind you, Mr. Hawkes is a professional. Well, it's just a friendly game. Oh, friendly game. ♪ Rock of ages cleft for me ♪ Let me hide myself in thee ♪ Let the water and the blood ♪ From thy wounded side which flow'd ♪ ♪ Be of sin the double cure ♪ Safe from wrath and make me pure ♪ That's some fine singing, fine singing. Good harmony. Those old hymns are the best, aren't they? Supper's ready. Would you care to join us, Mr. Cassidy? Have you had your supper, Ethan? Well, actually, no. Oh, then join us, please. It's not fancy, but you're more than welcome to it. Well, in that case, I'm most obliged. Uh, but first, let us pray. Dear Lord, let the hearts and minds of the sinners and drinkers of Virginia City be open to our words and deeds. We ask this in your name and God bless this food unto our bodies. Amen. Amen. That's straight. You win. Again. Gentlemen, what do you say let's call it a night? It is getting late. Whatever you'd like. I'd like Miss LaRosa not to know about this. My father was a Saturday night man. He slept his hangovers through a life of Sundays. Pretty soon it was every day of the week, me and my mother dragging him out of the saloon. Then Carrie Nation, the great temperance preacher, came to our town of Mount Eagle. When I heard her words, I knew right then I had a purpose and a cause. And it was that cause that got you tossed out of Leadville and it's gonna get you run out of Virginia City. Johnson, you had to show up here! Come on, Melody. Take old Sailor's evil whiskey away from him. Come on, girl! $20,000. I'll have Sailor get the strongbox and cash in your chips. Sailor! Sailor! Uh, excuse me, Sir, but your friend is over by our tent and he seemed to be quite drunk. I'm terribly sorry. I'll take care of it. Well, now we know where Sailor is. If you'll excuse me. Ethan's over there, too. Diamond Jim has invited us here personally, Sir, and you're drunk. Well, listen to psalm-singing sister! Ain't we the pious little girl all of a sudden? Why don't you just leave! Leave? I'll leave when I'm damn good and ready! The lady asked you to leave. You stay out of this, cowboy! My pants! Look what she done to my pants! Oh, you standing up for the little girl, are you, cowboy? Are you all right? 'Cause you're about to wish you hadn't. Sailor! Sailor! Sailor! There seems to be a difference of opinion here. You got that right. Well, this is no time or place to settle our differences. You got a better idea? Well, as a matter of fact, I do. Your friend Cassidy here seems to have taken an obvious dislike to my associate, Mr. Johnson. He's got a bit mouth! Ah, easy, gentlemen! Easy, easy, easy, easy! In as much as you're a gambling man, I have a thought. What's on your mind? Well, if Mr. Cassidy agrees, I can arrange a small, say, three round exhibition bout between you and Sailor here before the Corbett-Sullivan fight. Why wait? Let's just settle it right now. Because I can't promote it! Mr. Hawkes cleaned me out at poker tonight. What do you say, Mr. Hawkes? How about a bet between the boys for the amount of money I lost tonight in the poker game? Take that bet. I'll fight you any place, any time. I feel it only fair to tell you, Sailor was the middleweight Atlantic fleet champion all four years he was in the Navy. Was! Undefeated. Well, that's not fair. What kinda wager is that? Well, I'm willing to give odds. What kind? Three to one. And your man doesn't even have to beat him, all he has to do is stay in the ring with him for three rounds. Conscious, of course. Make it five to one, an even hundred thousand dollars. It's a bet. Goodnight, Miss Burgundy. Sailor. See you in the ring, Cassidy. Three rounds. Nothing to it. Hop out, darling. We're supposed to be looking for Ethan, Daddy. Darling, you know you're my one and only and I'd do most anything for you. But when it comes to the manly art of fisticuffs, you take the hindquarters. What are you saying, Daddy? I'm saying there ain't no way I'm gonna miss this here fight. Daddy! Regardless. Here we are. Miss Burgundy. I'd like to wish you very good luck tonight, Miss Burgundy. Think you'll be needing it. Oh, I don't know about that, Diamond Jim. Ethan's carved up like a Greek god. I think my boys will do very fine. Well, it's possible. It's possible. 'Course, that's what General Custer said. Mm-hmm, so did Crazy Horse. It's now my privilege to introduce to you a man as well known as the Wild West itself! Gambler, gunfighter, lawman, and now sportswriter for the New York Telegraph, formerly of Deadwood, Dodge City, and Tucson, the one, the only Bat Masterson! Thank you very much, ladies and gentlemen. It's a pleasure for me to be here tonight, back in the west again, where you know I spent so much of my earlier life. Now, ladies and gentlemen, a three round grudge match in the true western tradition, the memory of which I so deeply cherish. From New York City, Sailor Johnson, the US Navy Fleet Champion versus Ethan Cassidy! Did you hear that, Daddy? Ethan's here. Well, let's go get him and bring him back to Texas. Now, hold on, little girl. I reckon we can watch the boy fight a few rounds, see what he's made of. But Daddy you promised! Now, don't push me, Ruby Roy. You're too emotional about this boy. It's just not healthy. Let's see if we can find a seat here. Sir, let my daughter sit in that seat, would ya? The legendary Bat Masterson, ladies and gentlemen. ♪ He wore a cane and derby hat ♪ They called him Bat ♪ Bat Masterson Now, what is this for? I don't know. One of the men in Gentleman Jim Corbett's dressing room said we should do this. It's not gonna help anyway. Are you worried, Brady? I mean, 'cause if you are, rest easy, 'cause I feel really good. I feel really good. Ethan, I'm glad you feel good, but sooner or later we have to accept the fact that this Sailor is a professional fighter. Come on, Brady. Look, I'm in the best shape of my life. What do you mean? This guy just bit off a little bit more than he can chew. I think I can take him. I promise I'll take him. Might let him have the first round. Nah, I'll just knock him out. Yeah, you do that. You know, I think this is gonna help. I won't hurt him so bad. Come to wish me luck, have you? No. Actually, I've come to ask a favor of you, Percival. I told you my real name in confidence and in a moment of weakness. Don't you ever call me that in public. Don't fight Ethan Cassidy. You are a trained boxer, you could kill him. I could and I might. Don't you understand, Sailor? This is all my fault. Ethan was only doing what any gentleman would have done, standing up for a lady. Oh, get down off your high horse with me. I was there, remember? When you was trailing the fleet up and down the east coast? That was a long time ago. I have seen the light and I pray that one day you will, too. And now, ladies and gentlemen, our first event of the evening! Sailor Johnson from New York City and Ethan Cassidy, a cowboy from somewhere in Montana! Your referee this evening, Mr. Armand Gemmerman! Ethan, I'm not kidding. You better run from this guy. Can't do that. Look at all the people here. There he is, Daddy! Oh, isn't he beautiful? Let's go get him! Sit tight there, little girl, sit tight. I want to watch my boxing first. Let's go! All right, over here. Let's go. Miss Burgundy. Why don't you introduce me to your friend? Why, certainly. Melody O'Rourke, may I present to you Mr. William Barclay Masterson. Better known as Bat. My pleasure, Miss. Bat Masterson, the famous journalist? Well, I'm impressed that you know me. Well, in my profession it always helps to be written about in the right circles. And what might your profession be? The temperance movement, Mr. Masterson. The temperance movement. Well, of course, the temperance movement. I hope you close down every saloon from here to California, except, of course, the ones that I frequent. Would you care to join us? Oh, thank you. Fighters, center of the ring! Fight fair, have a good fight. Shake hands. Miss Burgundy. You, get out of my way. Let's go. Cassidy! Tear him up! Run! I told you to run! Run! I told you you can't fight this guy like a lumberjack! Move, move! Yeah, I'm beginning to understand that. Okay, I'll move, move! No. Huh? Sit down. Down in front. Ruby Roy, I don't think this husband of yours is doing very well. Well, he'll get him, Daddy. He'll get him, you just wait and see. He'll tear him up. Don't toy with the kid, Sailor. Put him away. Now! I'll take him, Jim. See that you do. Was this an act of desperation, Miss Burgundy, or do you know something that I don't know? Right now I'd say your bet with Diamond Jim is in jeopardy. You may be right. We must have faith. Faith? Oh, I like that. Faith. But right now we need more than that. We need a miracle. Okay, let's go, let's go! Come on. Listen to me, listen to me. You wanted him to have round one, he took it. Let's go. How do you feel? Where's my hat? Run! Run! Do what I told you! Stay away from him! Move around, Ethan! Move around! That's right, move! Move! That's right, yes! Keep moving! Interesting technique. I don't think I've ever seen that before. Giddy-up, cowboy! I thought you wanted to fight so damn bad. Come on, you varmint. You afraid of an old man? I thought I was gonna be fighting a cowboy, not a coward! Stay back! Coward? Oh, yes, yes, come on! Come on! Want some more? Look, Daddy! Ethan's stunned him. If he did, Sugar, he did it with his chin. Ha! Hit him! Get him! Go get him now! Go get him now! Go get him, Ethan! Come on, Ethan! Ethan! One! Two! Three! Come on, Ethan, get up! Four! Five! Over here, come this way! Come over here. Oh, Ethan, get up! Ethan get up! Six! Seven! Ethan. Hey, be careful. Be careful now! Sit down, sit down. Listen to me. You may just get your miracle yet. It's all right, you're doing good. Brady. Your boy doesn't seem to be holding up too well. He's doing the best he can, that's all he can do. I've seen this Sailor Johnson in action before. Good pugilist, but he's got an Achilles heel. What is it? Before he throws a right, he'll roll his left shoulder. Every time? Every time. You hear that? What? Look, stay away from him if you can. If you can't, watch that left shoulder. Come on. Let's go. Ethan! Ethan! What? What? Yeah. Uh... Yes! Yes! Get him, Ethan! Get him, Ethan! Cover up, Sailor! Cover up, Sailor! That a boy, Ethan! That's my husband! Ethan! Look out! Hit him, Sailor! No! One! Two! Three! He's finished. -It's a knockout! And the winner is Sailor Johnson! Sailor Johnson has defeated Ethan Cassidy! Brady, is he okay? Brady! Burgundy! Ladies and gentlemen, sinners take heed! Excuse me. Excuse me! Excuse me! Excuse me! Ethan! How'd I do? Not very good, Honey. We gotta get out of here. Come on. Can I go get him him now, Daddy? All right, Darling, go get him. That is the road to hellfire and damnation! Out of my way, poster girl. Now, you take heed of this, too, little sister. You're standing in the way of me and my husband, Ethan Cassidy! Husband? I doubt very seriously that man would marry you. Yeah! I want that man there, Ethan Cassidy. And you too, Hawkes. You're in big trouble. That's just what we need! The judge is here. Let's go. Let's go. Ladies, break it up, please! Stay out of my fight! Where am I going? Come on, Melody! Come on! Get her! Melody! Put it to her, Honey! Put it to her! That Bean family's starting to get on my nerves. Lucky punch. You're lucky it didn't happen two rounds sooner. Brady, there's some horses. Let's take them and go, come on. One thing I am not is a horse thief. That buggy looks awfully tempting, though. Brady, can you drive that thing? Well, it can only go forward or backwards. Either way, we're out of this town. Ethan, crank it up. What? Well, I hope you can drive it, Brady. The only hope now to get our money back is to beat Lute to San Francisco. Yeah, there she goes! Come on, come on. Go, go! Yeah, I think I'm starting to get the hang of this thing now. Well, that's good, 'cause if we don't get there by nine o'clock when the game starts, all this is for nothing. No, I figure we're somewhere around in here and it's my best guess that we need to head for San Francisco in that direction. Hey! I don't need a damn map to tell me which way to go. We head west. And that way is west, you moron. Hyah! Hey! Hey, old-timer! How far is it to San Francisco? That'll be mister to you. Oh, it'll take you about three days by horse. Brown, look at that, would you? Bad enough we got all them horseless carriages. Now, what do you suppose they call that? Two-wheeled horse? No, it's too ugly to be a horse. Whoa, hey, hey, hey! Hey, hey, hey! Hey, hey, hey! Hey, Mister. Hey, Mister! Mister, call off your dog. You know, Brown's got a mind of his own. I never interfere. Hey, hey, hey! Hey, hey! Hey, get, hey! Good boy. Yeah. What the hell do you call that thing? A motorcycle. It's called a motorcycle. Say, you mind coming over here and giving me a hand with this thing? Oh, I wouldn't touch it, no. It's bad enough having to look at it. 'Course, if it was a horse, I'd gladly lend you a hand or a mule. If it was a horse, you wouldn't have to be pushing it, would you, you'd be riding it. With a mule you might have to push. Mules'll do that, they'll balk on you. Hey. You got any gasoline? Say what? I said, you got any gasoline? Got gas, six cents a gallon. Got a room, 50 cents a night. Got supper, 40 cents a plate. Got water, it's free. Oil, it's a nickel. Yeah, fine, just give me the gasoline. Yes, Sir. Uh, have you got any facilities? Facilities? Yeah. Outhouse right over yonder. Ah. Hey, hey! Dollar in advance. A dollar? You're charging me a dollar to use the outhouse? You betcha. Commode like that be worth it's weight in gold. Just a matter of timing. Here. You're an old thief. The Lord loves a cheerful giver. Hey! Oh, sorry. Ugh. Ain't paying no dollar just to answer the call of nature. Lookie here! Go get the horses. Say. That belong to you? You might say that. Brown, Brown, that's all right. Just let them boys work it out for themselves. Oh, that old boy ought to lead with his left. Huh? He... Cade! You just say the word and I'll blow his spleen through his spine. Okay, Brown. Old Brown prefers a fair fight. Elroy! The horse collar! Pull over close, now. Get me close. Ethan, get back in here! Ethan! Elroy, the money! Yeehaw! Sorry, boys, looks like we'll be playing in San Francisco after all! Shoot! I have had it with you, Cantrell! Yeah, that's Brown. Once he likes you, he's your friend forever. Oh, what difference does it make anyway? Every time I get my hands on that money, they take it away from me or you do. That's because you took it from me! After you took it from me! Why don't we take it from them? Okay. Yeah. I like it. Uh, what about him? Leave him. He's an idiot. Well, Sir, the end of the west is near. Huh? The... Never mind. Woo-hoo! Did you see that, Brady? Just like leaning down and picking up your hat. Pretty slick work all the way around, I'd say. You two are mighty proud of yourselves, aren't you? Yeah. You're lucky you didn't break your fool neck, Ethan. Hey, you can keep staring back there all you like, Miss Burgundy, you're not gonna see anything. We left those boys in the dust. Yeah, well, I'll still feel a lot better once we get to San Francisco. Give me that. You don't need that either. I'm sick of this horse collar. I'm gonna put the money in a satchel. We're almost there. See, I told you there was nothing to worry about. Hold on, Cade! Look, we're gonna get there. We may not be first, but we're gonna get there. Hot damn! We made it with time to spare. Does anybody see Lute or Cade? No sign of 'em. Let's get to the hotel. Okay, but be careful. Keep your eyes open. Those boys could be anywhere. There they are! Come on, come on! Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Lute, take some men and follow them. Come on! You four, go around that corner and cut him off! The rest of you boys stay with me. That money is not getting into that hotel! Come on! The last legal poker game in America. Who would have thought it? At least we're going out with a bang. That's the way life should be lived. No half measures. Are you absolutely certain that Brady Hawkes will be joining us? You took him apart in London. Believe me, he'll want another shot at you. I hope so. Well, you can forget Hawkes. Without a Maverick in it, you don't have a game. Or a Masterson. Bat, how are you? Sir Colin, permit me to present the ever-humble Bart Maverick. How do you do? My pleasure, Sir Colin. Well, now we have a Masterson, a Maverick, a British knight, hopefully Brady Hawkes. Who will be our fifth? Gentlemen, I think you're in for an interesting surprise. Burgundy, Burgundy. Okay, Brady, what are we gonna do now? I don't know, but we better find another way into that hotel. Yeah, and fast. Yeah. Come on. Ooh, that's not gonna work. Oh, oh! Hurry, hurry, hurry. End of the line, Hawkes. Get out of the way, Chinaman, or you're dead. Death is nothing to one who does not fear it. Oh, good. Then I won't feel too bad about this. Caine, my friend, thanks. I thought our luck had finally come to an end. The restoration of harmony is thanks enough. And as for luck, some of these here tonight will find it has abandoned them. But those who have faith will find the true path. Faith we have. Time we don't. Of course, it also helps to have the eyes of the eagle and the reflexes of a cat. Caine, my friend, you've helped us once and I may have to ask you to help us again. Whoa! In Chinatown there is always a way. I will take you to Master Ping, my cousin. Come. Now let's go play some cards, huh? Almost to the end of our journey. The ultimate quest has no ending. That is what gives the quest its ultimate value. I love it when he talks like that. Where do you think you're going? Why, I'm a guest at this hotel. Okay, Mr. Ping, we're counting on you. Hey, hey, hey, hey. Where are you going? Oh, deliver food. Uh, cook over there bring here new idea. No charge deliver food. Hey, pardon! Where I come from, we don't call that food. We call that fish bait. Well, pilgrim, maybe it wasn't prepared right. Hey! Oh, what'd you do? Beat it! I'm surrounded by idiots! Wouldn't leave that out too long. Hey. Any sign of 'em? No. What happened to the men? Don't ask. Where have you been? Chasing them through Chinatown. Chinatown? Yeah. Ethan Cassidy! Oh! I've found you! I would know those boots of yours anywhere. Daddy Bean! Daddy Bean! Nobody move! What? You must feel lucky, Cowboy. Ethan! Don't! Ruby Roy! Stand back. These men obviously got a disagreement to settle. It's all over, Mr. Hawkes. You just missed a great fight, Hawkes. I bet. Who won? Corbett. Knocked Sullivan out in the 21st round. My, you're as pretty as ever, Miss Burgundy. Hawkes. Give me the money. What seems to be the problem here? I am. Now. Give the lady the money. We walk out of here and nobody gets hurt. Don't do it. Now, Hawkes. Ah! Nah, it's not the Indian. Ah! Seems like he's on my list. Boys, tag him, tie him, and hold him till I'm ready to go. Cade Dalton. And I can take my husband back to Texas with me? Honey, I told you once you're too emotional about this boy. He's a rambling man. I say, he'll just take off again. Marriage is annulled. Uh, Judge, I'd appreciate if you'd just make that official. Yeah. Annulled! Thank you, Sir. Ruby Roy, just as soon as this game is over, we're heading back to Texas, where we belong. Daddy Bean, we just traveled all through the west to San Francisco to find my husband and now you've just taken him away from me. Well, I'm not getting in that car! I don't care! I'm not going any place without my husband! Here you go, Ma'am. Ruby? I'll be back in a minute, Daddy. So Butterfingers O'Malley is your mother? How many people in that game knew about that? Only me. She was supposed to give me the cards I needed to win. No, she was just supposed to make sure you didn't lose. What's the difference? This is all for nothing. What do you mean? If I can't win on my own, what kind of man am I? Your mother is not gonna be dealing to me tonight. This is the most important poker game of my life and I still don't know whether I can play or not. Hey, wait a minute. Let me tell you something. This is the most important game to me, too. I was the one that went down to Mexico and dragged you all the way up to Dodge City. Yeah, I was the one that rigged the game so you could win. Probably didn't have to 'cause you're the best poker player I ever met in my life. But I needed some insurance. See, what you don't know is that tonight you're gonna be playing for a bunch of kids in an orphanage. Orphanage? A bunch of kids who hadn't been dealt a fair hand since the day they was born. I'm the only momma they've got and I'm gonna make damn sure they continue to have a roof over their head and the best of life I can possibly give to 'em. Now, that's what's at stake. And if those kids aren't enough motivation for you to play your best in this game tonight, then you better find something in your heart that is. 'Cause the best four poker players in the world are upstairs and they're waiting on you. Daddy Bean always told me when you find the right man, do what's ever in your heart to bring him home. You're gonna love Langtry. Bat, thanks so much for your help. You and your cane. I had to. We needed your money in the game. It wouldn't be big time poker without Brady Hawkes. Well put, Bat. Mr. Hawkes, we meet again. I'm awfully glad you're here. Sir Colin Douglas, my partner, Miss Burgundy Jones. How do you do, Ma'am? How do you do? I hope a little luck goes with you this time, Hawkes, considering we're in your country. It's a pleasure to meet you, Ma'am. Bat, shall we? Miss Burgundy. So was that him? That's him. They call him the Gentleman Gambler. I can see why. Don't let those manners fool you. When he plays, he's vicious. I go where the Lord sends me and right now, I'm going to close down that game! Ladies, Sailor, follow me. Gentlemen of the press, if you could wait right here. Not him again. Sailor has taken his last step for the Devil and his first step for the Lord. How do you feel, Sailor? Like a new man. Don't you try and stop us, Ethan Cassidy. We have business here. Step back, please, we're going to have our picture taken. Line up, girls. You get in the front, you're shortest. Where is she? Get up there. Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. My name is Lady Li. For those who knew him, I was Mr. Paladin's personal dealer. It will be my pleasure to deal for you. You gentlemen all know one another. Oh, yes. Yes, Ma'am, we do. Mr. Masterson. Now, gentlemen, my surprise. Our fifth player. It gives me great pleasure to present the President of the United States, the honorable Theodore Roosevelt. Masterson. How nice to see you. Mr. President, I haven't seen you since Africa. What a wonderful safari. Oh, please, please, sit. Mr. President, I'm surprised to see that you play poker in public. I wouldn't miss a chance to compete against the finest. We welcome your money, Sir. As long as it is yours and not the taxpayers. I promise. My allowance. Please continue, Miss Li. The game will be five card stud, check and raise. The cards are from the late Mr. Paladin's personal stock. By his rules, the game will be played until sunrise. When a player loses his stake, he's out of the game. Buy in is $100,000. You may purchase your chips now. I'll be right up, Sailor. It's such a pleasure to see you again. So I guess you'll make the headlines in all the newspapers tonight. Maybe you'll be bigger than Billy Sunday and Carrie Nation combined, huh? And I'm closing down the last legal poker game in America just to show this country what it should have done a long time ago. Melody. You listen! First it'll be whiskey and beer and then every saloon in the country. It's gonna happen, Ethan. Tonight is just the beginning. You just don't understand, do you? Upstairs right now are the last of the great gamblers, Brady Hawkes among 'em. Men who take a lot of pride in their profession. Winning the last game... If you want to get your name in the papers by swinging your ax down on their game, my friend and my partner, then you go ahead and you do it. You just remember, you'll have plenty of games and saloons to close down. That all lies in front of you. Those men up there, they're days are done without you. Without your hands, without your ax. Times change. Some of us can't change with 'em. So you just do what you gotta do. Running this great country is a gamble. I mean, after all, politics is about winning and losing. Hell, we gambled when we split from you boys, right, Sir Colin? I mean, it's just like you and your kings against my deuces. Now, my deuces are not very powerful, unless I have a lot of them. Sir Colin, kings bet. In honor of King Edward and his fine Edwardian Age we live in, my kings bet 5000. Ah. Those kings look pretty potent, Sir Colin, but you, Mr. President, I think you've got the whole militia buried under that card. I'm gonna fold. I'm with you, Bart. Never did care much for politics. I'm out. Well! I'll call. Pair of kings. Bully! Three deuces! Let's hear it for the little man. They brought the President in and everybody's being real nice to him. With our money. He's a hell of a soldier. If I'd 'a been a younger man, I'd 'a been right there with him, one of his Rough Riders. I'll bet 4000. Pair of nines. I'll see that. Well, as Commander-in-Chief, I order a retreat. Follow and fold. I'm strong, Bat, but I am gonna see it. Last card. No help. Thank you. Three nines. No help. I'm out. You're not alone, Brady. You know, Brett would have gotten any card he needed. Damn. He's just not getting the cards. It's nice to win, gentlemen. It reminds me of the time back in Denver, when the gangsters ran me out of town. My cards were running as hot as Lillie Langtry's lips. Gentlemen, with your permission, a new deck, please, Lady Li. Here comes trouble. You're not really gonna do this, are you? Don't worry. There'll be no interruptions. Sailor is guarding the door. How's he doing? Not so good. Three queens. Well, it's about time for this Maverick to start drawing some cards. Jacks and nines. Beats me. And me. Gentlemen, an issue of the utmost importance has just come up. I'm terribly sorry, but I am going to have to leave the competition. Oh! It seems that word has leaked out to Mrs. Roosevelt. I told the little woman that I had some fundraising to attend to. Unfortunately, this is the type of fundraising that she doesn't approve of. Mr. President, I think we've all been in similar circumstances before and I would like to recommend that we allow you to keep the balance of your stake. No, no, Sir. The rules. Always follow the rules. This goes to the winner. No, no, please. Thank you, gentlemen, Lady Li. A game enjoyed among men should always have the highest priority. Goodnight, all. Fine man. Tough job. Just a pair of threes. Embarrassing. But a winner. Looks like Sir Colin's up about 30,000. Hmm. All right, I'll see the 10 and raise my last 10,000. I'll see ya. Beats me. He had 'em. I know he had the flush. Why did he fold? Call. 10 high straight. Full house. Ooh. He knew. I'm definitely not the best poker player in the Maverick family. Gentlemen, thank you very much. Gentlemen, I should like to make a toast as the end of an era draws to its close. To Bart Maverick, for carrying on the great name of his family. Hear, hear. To Bat Masterson, an American legend without peer. And to Brady Hawkes, a man whose very nature personifies your young and exciting country. Thank you, Sir. Thank you very much, Sir. Good evening. Lady Li. Good evening. Gentlemen. We now have three players. Pair of aces. Three sevens. That finishes me. You know, Brady, it isn't how much luck you have, it's when you have it. And right now, my luck seems to be running out on me. You two are wallowing in it. Thanks, Bat. Pleasure. Thank you, Bat. Enjoy. Lady Li. Mr. Masterson. Gentlemen. Sunrise is in 30 minutes. Just like old times, Hawkes. Just you and me. The way it should be. Cards, gentlemen. Deuce. King. King bets. I've got a hunch. 20,000. I'm in. Pair of deuces. Pair of kings. Kings bet. I do so enjoy royalty. 40,000. 40,000. King. Seven. Kings bet. Check. Check. Last card. Three deuces. Two pair, kings and sevens. Deuces bet. Well, Sir Colin, kings again. Could it be that might is right? Let's see. 40,000. He's got him. His three of a kind beat two pair. We've both er, got just about $150,000. Time being short, why don't we play them all? He's bluffing. No, he's not. He's got the cards. I'll call. Sorry to do this to you on your home ground, old boy. But then again, there's no good place for defeat. Full house. You know, Sir Colin, there are very few things as satisfying as watching a real artist play and you are truly that. One thing that may be, though, is beating that artist. Four twos! He had 'em! Well played, Hawkes. You're the best. Sir Colin, the English, always a gentleman, even in defeat. Mr. Hawkes, the money will be in the safe. Congratulations, Hawkes. You're up there with the greats. Thanks, Bat. I always had a feeling about you, Brady. You did, didn't you? Yeah. You know, Burgundy, I know that part of this is supposed to be mine, but, well, I think you have a better use for it than I do. Gambling's not really about money. It's just our way of keeping score. Thanks, Brady. That's big of you. Broke again. Well, I heard they discovered gold in the Yukon. Let's go! Ethan. Uh, thank you, Ma'am. Gentlemen, I believe the Lord is about to speak to us directly. What was that? Earthquake. Oh, there's no such things as earthquakes in San Francisco. ♪ You got to know when to hold 'em ♪ ♪ Know when to fold 'em ♪ Know when to walk away ♪ And know when to run ♪ You never count your money ♪ When you're sitting at the table ♪ ♪ There'll be time enough for counting ♪ ♪ When the dealing's done ♪ You got to know when to hold 'em ♪ ♪ When to hold 'em ♪ Know when to fold 'em ♪ When to fold 'em ♪ Know when to walk away ♪ And know when to run ♪ You never count your money ♪ When you're sitting at the table ♪ ♪ There'll be time enough for counting ♪ ♪ When the dealing's done ♪ You got to know when to hold 'em ♪ ♪ Know when to fold 'em ♪ Know when to walk away ♪ And know when to run ♪ You never count your money ♪ When you're sitting at the table ♪ ♪ There'll be time enough for counting ♪ ♪ When the dealing's done
