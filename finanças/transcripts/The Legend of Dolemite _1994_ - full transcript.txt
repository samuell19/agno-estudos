Ladies and gentlemen, this night is dedicated to Mr. Rudy Ray Moore! [Funky Music Playing] [Man] Yes! [Audience Cheering] [Man] This is [INAUDIBLE] [Audience Laughing] I'm gonna get you [INAUDIBLE] hard as stone. Say that son, say that. I just love to make a broad moan and cry. Easy baby. I used to be young, dumb, and full of cum [INAUDIBLE] shit! And always ready to turn a trick. Say it! With this big 'ol long dick, uh huh, and I used it [INAUDIBLE] a walkin' stick. Get on, get on! I fucked everything hot 'n holler! From a stovepipe to a [INAUDIBLE] Ow! I fucked an ape in a cape, a goat in a coat, a cat in a hat and a pig in a wig. You know what? I fucked Siamese twins. They were joined at they spine. Look out, son! I stuck it in one of 'em pussy, and it come out the other's behind. Bad, bad Dolemite. Yeah! [Funky Music Playing] Hey Dolemite. * I'm the bad [INAUDIBLE] hold the mic Say what? * So bad [INAUDIBLE SINGING] * Bad bad Dolemite * Bad bad Dolemite * Bad bad Dolemite * The bad bad Dolemite Yeah! * Bad, bad, bad, bad Dolemite Yeah! Yeah! [Funk Music Playing] I was born in Fort Smith, Arkansas but I migrated to Cleveland, Ohio in my teenage years. Grew up in Cleveland, went to the Army. Come out at the age of 22. Then I migrated to Los Angeles in search for a singing career. [Fast Drum Music] My first performing career was an interpretive dancer. That is someone that dances to the jungle drums, and they do work with African rhythms and, uh, Hindu rhythms. I was that type of a dancer. And then we called it adagio dancing also. * You got to step it up, go * You gotta step it up and go, yeah My first singing career started on King Federal Records. I was produced by one of the great producers of that time, Mr. Ran Bast. I did a record called "Step it Up and Go". That almost got to be a hit. And I made records for Dooto records. That's a re-label that started Redd Foxx. Dootsie Williams was the, uh, owner of the label. He'd come to the California Club and sold me on stage workin' and asked me to be a record for his label. I did a record called "Bellow the Belt". Another one called "Let's Come Together". Neither one of them made it. And I want this to be known by the world that I was not able to make it in my singing career and had great, great song because I was hid behind singers like Pat Boone and other white singers that had the airwaves. And I was not able to get a break at that time. [Music Playing] * Step it up, go! This is Rudy Ray Moore I am at the record center of the west, which is Dolphin's of Hollywood. Two locations. I am at the one on Vernon and Central. I worked at a record store because uh, I wanted to get into the record business and learn how to manufacture and produce records. The man that I worked for was John Dolphin of Dolphin's of Hollywood. And he taught me the ropes of how to produce a record. Then I started making my own masters and producing my own records. In other words, I'd been self made, uh, all of my whole career. I first hear the Dolemite from a wino. I was working in Dolphin's at Hollywood as their management. There was a wino come in named Rico. And he wanted, uh, me to give him some money for soup. 'Cause he didn't have any teeth. So I told him I said used to hear him on the street corners doing all of these raps and rhymes and so forth. I says "Rico, you do Dolemite, I'm gonna give you some money for some soup." He did Dolemite in the middle of the floor of the store where I was working and people just rolled. So, I thought then I said "now, he's not a professional, I'm not a professional comedian." "What if I... did Dolemite?" And sure enough I invited him to my house to give him a little reefer and some wine. He put Dolemite on tape. I recorded it. And the rest is history. "Some folks say that Willie Green was the baddest motherfucker the world ever seen. But I want you to light you up a joint, take a real good shit and screw your wig on tight. And let me tell you about the little bad motherfucker called Dolemite." Eat out more often, I made it. I carried it to the record distributors. The man's in charge of distribution said "Rudy"... says "What on Earth you expect to do with this piece of shit?" I said "Sell it." "He slapped his pappy's face and said "from now on cocksucker, I'm runnin' this place." At the age of 1... he was drinkin' whiskey and gin. At the age of 2, he was eatin' the bottles it came in." And, I put records in my car. Driven across country and passed them out in the ghetto areas of many of the major cities. Handin 'em to street lovin' people. And in Philadelphia when I passed this record out two days later, I had a smash hit. By word of mouth. "But his dick was still hard. The preacher said "ashes to ashes." The company that picked it up was Kent Records. When I was carryin' it over to another record company, they'd wanna give me you know, money, they'd wanna give me thousand dollars. Well I'd already got a $2700 order of the record. And I said "I can't do nothin' with a thousand dollars" to the man. Says "Rudy come back over here with that record." And uh, they distributed me across country. After that I recorded the second album. Called "This Pussy Belong to Me". Featured the signifying monkey. It hit the billboards, best selling charts, within two weeks after it was released. Dolemite albums are... somethin' that a... we as black men grow up listenin' to. I have your albums from my mother- I used to steal my mother's Rudy Ray Moore albums. I can say after hearing that I knew what pussy was. I knew what it looked like. I never seen it, but he described it so well. "So drop your drawers and get your legs open wide 'Cuz I'm gonna knock open your pussy and put this load deep down inside." I am the world's first comedian to come out doing X rated words on a record. Rudy's humor might've been on the on the on the risky side. He had some fly album covers. You'd se these records, and there'd be a whole bunch of buck naked women and Rudy Ray Moore in bed with a wig on doin' some crazy stuff. I wanted to be as shocking as I could be. The language was already shocking. But the album covers were so erotic. And the people, some people would buy it yearly for the album cover. "Gave $100 bills just to see this little girl a-play. She was the best whore on any block. She went from city to city, fuckin' the mayors and senators, the presidents and the whole government lot. She show sup to the police-" Rudy was the bad boy of the whole thing. And Rudy name mean. Uh, Queen Bee is the shit. Dom't mess with Queen Bee. Queen Bee is my name, and fuckin' is my game. I know the game from A-Z 'cuz ain't nothin' a motherfucker can pull on me. Lady Reed was a lady that I picked up to try to make a comedian and [INAUDIBLE] out of. She made it... awhile with me and went on the road and traveled with me here as my costar. "I'd like to bring to the floor the queen. The queen of the party records. Let's hear it A big hand for the fabulous Lady Reed." "Like I said, yous with you got to give what you want if it's good pussy. Sell it. If it's bad pussy, sell it. If it's fat pussy, skinny pussy sell it. If it's young pussy, sell it. If it's old pussy, give it a shot of jack-rabbit juice and geritol. And sell that old motherfucker." She quit before [INAUDIBLE] she's passed about three years ago. But I got to take it off to Lady Reed, she was a very dear friend of mine. And wrote several things for me including one great one. "My day have arrived." "Now the course has changed. And I'm pretty much on my way. The time has arrived. And it's my God-damned day." It was in the context of his life As an artists trugglin', you know, a black man strugglin' tryin' to make it. And then tryin' to do somethin' for his people. But I, I just felt that he wasn't appreciated eh, uh, enough. That's why I wrote my, that inspiration song. My, uh, "My Day Arrived". "Your dreams get wasted. And your black ass slide back. So while I'm climbin' this mountain... friends, have no fear. I'm gonna remember all when I needed someone who stood by that was near." I will say that we toured we lived in hotels that were not what you call Triple A hotels. But she said "Rudy," says "I don't mind stayin' wherever you put me. I have a son that I'm tryin' to send to college. And I need to save money." So, we worked many places where I promoted the show. [Upbeat Music] See at that time, "Streaking" was out. And Rudy got this red van sellin' he was gonna streak. And I just get in the car and said "Oh Lord help him." And he, well he would just come straight on out streaking in the towel and flash it. But first a woman said "drop yer drawers". I'm lookin' at ladies "Drop yer drawers." So Rudy decide to take the towel and oh, everybody wanted to see. Now I'm tryin' to get the women on my side and they watchin' where, wah, where Rudy dick was. How long it was or what it was. Woman snatched the towel, he had to run out there naked with all his black ass out. I'm tellin' you, they was fun. She would go on before me and do her act. And then I'd sit in the booth and take the money. And when she's gettin' ready to come off I would run back to the stage and she would run back to the booth. I remember one time we in the [INAUDIBLE] Texas and I had so much money all in my drawers, all in my bra... and I, I couldn't give noth- Rudy nothin' at the, at the place. I say "wait 'til you get home." And I, I would unhook that bra and money just fall out everywhere. So, we had good times out there. You know, knowing that we could make it on our own. "For if I should get broke I'm not gonna feel bad. I'm gonna get my kicks thinkin' about swingin' times I've had." [Big Band Music] "I hope this is a hit." One of my uh, favorite memories of Rudy Ray Moore and myself when we worked at the York Club here in Los Angeles. The club owner, Bob, he fired Rudy. And I say "well, if Rudy go, I go." So me and Rudy walked out and we shook hands. [AUDIO MISSING] -say "one day we gonna become big stars." * Oh, he's bad * Mm, the man is outa sight Just bein' a record star with comedy records I, that wasn't where I wanted to end up at. And I was never got on a screen if I had a waited for somebody to put me on it. So the way I got on the screen was to put myself on it. "Well where is he?" "Breathin' down yo neck!" I put the little money that I had together and made the motion picture "Dolemite" and lo and behold, I was made fun of that. People sayin' that fool is over there spendin' all of his money tryin' to make a motion picture that'll never get shown in a theater. "I know you think you're smart, see, 'cause you got on them flashy clothes, you got that big car there. You got all them black bitches workin' for you." "You forgot about the white ones." God rest his soul, D'Urville Martin, who was the director had told everybody this was a piece of shit and it wouldn't turn out to be anything and he wasn't giving it his best. But however the actors was givin' it their best. "Just look at that damn Watergate scandal. Now, if the leader of our country is stealing and getting away clean what the hell do they expect us to do?" Well Dolemite ain't the type of nigger to just fuck around and do anythang. Just 'cuz they say "here's a check." You know what I'm sayin'? Nigger's like "No, I got to be whoopin' somebodies ass in this movie." [Gunshots] Bone crushin' skull splittin' brain blastin' action. Let me tell you about the openin' of Dolemite. Played in Indianapolis, Indiana. And it was sold out at midnight for a midnight show. "It's nice to have seen you people. But fuck you, man." "I'm gonna kill Dolemite. I don't want no sweat. Let's turn the place out!" I had never seen so many, many people. It took me around the block around 3 times. Those were long blocks, too. And then finally I got in and we went over good. So that gave us comfort in knowing that we really had a package. Even though we didn't have nobody to back us out. I come back to Los Angeles went to Dimension Pictures... they picked it up... and made a monstrosious trailer... for the movie. "If you- [NO AUDIO] to find that action. Coming to this theater as this next attraction is the picture that will put you in traction. Dolemite. Starring me, Rudy Ray Moore as Dolemite. And that bad D'Urville Martin as Willie Green. Dolemite. Dolemite!" It played its first engagement [INAUDIBLE] 1975 at the Woods Theater. The lines seven deep. And this show was supposed to close but that man, they was makin' so much money, he didn't close the show. 'Til 3 or 4 o'clock in the mornin', we showin' that. And stepped out the Cadillac, our feet didn't even touch the ground. I remember just glowing inside. The people had us moving inside with us. I walked up and down the streets and cracked jokes to the people that stood in line. Thanking them for coming out to see my screen performance. "Since you wanted my love, I'm gonna give you a fuckin' you'll never forget!" fuckin' you'll never forget." There was a man that wrote an article on me said "despite Dolemite bein' possibly the blockbuster of the season it is coarse, rude and vulgar. And isn't fit for a blind dog to see." Put that in the Chicago Defender. And the people said "we going to see just how vulgar this man is." "I'm waitin' for Dolemite." "For who?" "Dolemite, motherfucker!" Dolemite I actually went and saw 'cause friends said to me "you gotta see this movie." And uh, I did. And I've always I've always appreciated Rudy Ray Moore, mainly because he really was an independent film maker. The picture only run $90,000 to make. It played against films that costed 3 to 5 million dollars, out grossin' 'em. "You take care the business... I take care of the heat." But Rudy Ray Moore belongs in that, you know, Melvin Van Peebles Rudy Ray Moor, all these guys actually going out and hustling up their own money, and making their own movie. You know, outside of the mainstream. Dolemite got a powerful name. - Powerful name. - That's that's like dynamite. Dynamite. - He's on fire. - On fire. I didn't know him until around '86. I went and rented a video called "Dolemite". 1998, Dolemite after 25 years was played in Montreal Canada. Lines lined up for three blocks to see a 26 year old picture. Rudy Ray Moore has his own, uh, humor. His own brand of, uh, comedy. I think he makes fun of the situation in our society, the black situation, the black experience. [Whistles] So after that it was just kind of up the hill, you know. That was a success, then we went on and did the next one. [Drum Roll] [Funky Music Playing] He shaped a lot of black men, including myself, with his strength and his ability just to show us how we are. And, and, and sometimes how funny it is. [Groaning] "Yeah, damn baby! I got some shit we can do better than this." [Laughing] You know I watched that shit about 300 times at my mama house. [Man] Is that right? - 1987 I think it was. - The Human Tornado. That was the shit. "He made me do it!" "Bitch! Are you for real?" He then jump down the hill butt-ass naked. It showed the whole world that it as him. Oh, y'all didn't think it was me, huh? "So y'all don't believe I jumped, huh? So watch this good shit!" [Funky Music] Boy, he's a bad motherfucker man. He was doin' tricks with cameras before cameras even had tricks. [Screams] These are some of the maddest movies of all time, but as a black actor he's the greatest. "I'll stop this long haired [inaudible] dilapidated sheriff now! 'Cause he just wanna follow me anyhow. He think he's bad and ain't got no class I'm gon' rock this shotgun up his motherfuckin' ass!" Before Shaft kicked somebodies ass Dolemite whooped 'em! [Grunting] He turned out to be the hero of the film. And he did all this crazy karate. And they would talk like the lip-sync was always off, and the clothes was all crazy, and he would jump up and [gibbering]. [Gibbering] [Gibbering] [Gibbering] [Grunting] [Bone Snapping] "Over here!" [INAUDIBLE YELLING] Them wadn't ladies. Ladies got on a dress, show up at the job they little suit, sit at the desk. The kids, and these was bitches. [Karate Noises] Motha-fucka! Bitches! [Fighting Sounds] "Hurry Dolemite!" "Let me out!" [Grunting] We did not have a lot of money. So we had to do our own effects ourselves. [Distorted Echoing Yelling] That scene, I had pictures on the wall where you pull 'em and they'd slide up and down. I had the lights hooked up as to where they'd go off and on. I tied ropes to all four poles on the bed. And had a man down on his knees out of the camera angle pullin' this rope. And another one on the other end pullin' it and shakin' the bed, shakin' the bed. The cielin' would break down and fall over the bed by wiring the ceiling with an extra ceiling. "They're at the house. On the hill. In Pasadena! They're in the house. On the hill. In pasadena!" "Your career is over! Stud!" [Giggling] "This motherfucker think I'm dead. But he don't know I am the human Tornado." [Laughing] [Funky Music] I think the word "black exploitation" is crude. The Godfather, is that Italian exploitation? Nobody never says that. Bt it features an Italian theme. Now they made motion pictures that were westerns. That the Indian was always the loser, was that Indian exploitation? "[Inaudible]. Them people up there's havin' a party." "Aw damn [Inaudible] them ain't no people. Them's niggers!" "Oh by God, you're right mom, thems is niggers!" Uh, what we had went through in the film industry... of seein' ourselves kicked in the ass in the films, so many of them, instead of them kicking me in the ass, I started kicking them in the ass. "I got money. A, a lot of money! Here. Here-here in this bag. You can take it. Take, take all you want! Only, only, let me get the fuck outa here! Please!" "Beg little puppy, like a big dog." And it was done primarily in those years for a black audience. Although the white audiences are turned onto them now. And the Rudy Ray Moore movies, as you know, have become cult films almost like the martial arts films of the, of the 60's and 70's from from Hong Kong. Because they're so unique. They're his vision. "And if you don't die, you gonna wish to hell you had!" [Screams] I had a rat eat the man's nuts out once. Oh... He's ruthless. He's funny. "Where is that son of a bitch named Dolemite?" "Where is he?" "Leave him alone!" I tell all young people today you don't have to spend a fortune to make your picture if you got the right ingredients in it. The people were proud to see a black man come out with a film where he wasn't gettin' his ass kicked. So, it worked for me. This right here is, look at the gangster man, look at that. Look at that look. Petey Wheatstraw. "Just let me get the hell outta here!" "Your name will be Petey Wheatstraw. [Funky Music] * Petey Wheatstraw Petey Wheatstraw is the shit though. [Man] Petey Wheatstraw? - The Devil's son-in-law. - Yeah. [Funky Music] - Petey Wheatstraw. - The Devil's son-in-law. I knew it, I knew it. Petey I told you it wadn't gonna work. Oh my apartment must be a wreck! Petey maybe you shoulda married her. Now you got to be sick! [Demons Growling] [Screaming] Petey Wheatstraw, the Devil's son-in-law... That was my third venue of making films. "You got to be sick. How in hell can I give you a son?" "By simply marrying my daughter." Petey Wheatstraw is an old folklore title. The man used the name in the 1930's. He called hisself as a blues singer Petey Wheatstraw. The Devil's son-in-law. So I come up and wrote a monologue on that and put it on one of my records. Petey Wheatstraw, the Devil's son-in-law. "Yes! I'm Petey Wheatstraw. The Devil's son-in-law. The [inaudible]. I went with [inaudible]. And even made love to old Lula Bell. I'm not here to brag nor here to boast. I can sit on a tombstone and produce baby ghosts." [Thunder Rumbling] It had some of the uh, mystic stuff in it. [Mystical Music] [Screaming] "And the Lord taketh away." Where I used a cane to uh, make things change. * Reality is plain to see * Get on * Down there where the live baby Make drawers come off of people. [Eerie Music] [Laughing] "How did you make that cane do that?" Turn them into dogs and so forth and so on. "He's a dog! He's a damn dog! Just turn him into a little black puppy." "That wish will b granted." "How did you do that?" "I got the power, mama, that's how. I got the power." So it was a great venue for me, and it still lives today. Can't give Dolemite an Oscar, maybe we should give him like a Johnson or Jones. [Laughing] The next picture was the Disco Godfather. [Disco Music] "It is showtime! Are you ready?" "Are you ready over there?" "Are you ready over there?" "Ladies and gentlemen... yes you and you, for a disco godfather?" "He's a godfather of disco." "He don't give no slack." "He'll boogie all around you." "Don't take no shit." [Inaudible] in Disco Godfather. That's, that's pretty hot. He's got like this crazy, um, angle dust flashbacks. "Drive down the court. Fake these two cats out! Ha! He lays it in!" "It's too ugly!" [Gasping] [Groaning] "And believe me, I speak from experience. If it hadn't been for Dr. Fred here, who caught me before it was too late, I could be here to tell you what hell can go through. So please leave it alone. If you haven't started, don't." "Thank you so much Michelle Stewart. For her very personal experience with angel dust." The disco godfather is a film tat I was influenced to do it by one of the friends of mine that worked with me in pictures and I had went all of these years without another film. The- [AUDIO DROP] -pictures at that time they did not want to reinvest in me. Because I filmed the Disco Godfather which was not a great seller. It's selling better today than it sold when it first come out. I don't- the Disco Godfather threw me off. Threw me off, man. * Of the disco * He's a godfather of the disco The drug use themes is what killed it. We were talking about and preachin' and trying to curb the peoples behavior and so forth. And it was not liked. Drug film like that had a great message but people are not coming to the theater to be uh, converted. They come to the theaters to enjoy the movie theater. And just as what I'm about as a filmmaker. [Clears Throat] "Excuse me, man." [Funky Music] All the kids in the neighborhood they wanted to be in a movie. He, he reached back and got them. "Looks like we all been invited to the party." And that's what bein' a sidekick of his 'cause he brought me on in there. I didn't have to have no resume or a whole lot of photographs or whatever. He did it a plain and kind and gentle way. He costarred me in his first film. "I work for nobody but the Lord. Because he said... Blessed are the pure in heart. A-men!" I never thought that I would have a friend who talked like Rudy Ray Moore. See, because I'm a gentleman. James Ingram... he appears in the first movie "Dolemite". Come out to be a great singing star. Marie Carter. She made up my film the first job that she had as a makeup artist. The late D'Urville Martin. He hadn't directed films, but he directed "Dolemite". Jerry Jones... He gave me my first break to do his first movie. - "So it's alright, huh?" - "Yeah." "What do you know about the fourth ward, Dolemite?" "Nothin'." "How 'bout some very classy young girls that knows a lot about karate?" "Come here!" "Where's Cavaletti?" "Where is he?" "Alright everybody listen!" "That sheriff is comin', and he's got a lot of men with him." Ernie Hudson, another great actor of today. [Funky Music] The first movie with Jimmy Lynch is "The Human Tornado". * I've travelled the world * I've travelled all 'round I saw this young man on stage in the California Club. I looked at his greatness and felt he needed a break. "What kind of shit is this?" So he's been tagging along with on all, all of those years, "Jimmy Lynch and Marie Love, I wanna thank y'all so much for coming out to be with me tonight." "Dolemite, brother, we wouldn't have missed it for the world." Dolemite was a rapper. Long before they called it rapping. When we'd get off of work at the [inaudible] at 2 o'clock in the morning Rudy would be, uh, rappin' down there on Central Avenue at Dolphin's of Hollywood. And everybody be crowdin' around the window, lookin' at him do the radio rabbit. So he the king of the raps, he he put the "R" in "rap". When I recorded such tales as a signifying monkey shinin' the great Titanic and Dolemite it had that uh, rappin' flavor to it. And it had the explissive language which a lot of people want to refer to it as four letter words, but I call it "Gheto Expressions", and a form of art. I know for me you've always inspired me, but in terms of that young generation you know, vibin' into Rudy Ray Moore. Well, the things that I were doing were sort of now and fresh for them. In other words, I did the Signifying Monkey and it was set to rap music, during that period. "Signifying Monkey" I remember really being struck by that. Because it was, it was so African you know, it was like "listen to this!" We used to listen to his uh, his records and everything, like "Way down in the jungle deep"... "The lion stepped on the signifying monkey's feet. The monkey said "motherfucker, can't you see?" You done stepped on my goddamned feet! "The monkey lived in the jungle in an old oak tree. Bullshittin' the lion every day in the week." The lion said "I ain't heard a word you said. Say two more and I'll go upside your motherfuckin' head." "Everyday before the sun go down, that lion would kick his ass. All through the jungle top." The monkey said "that's alright, 'cuz you gonna meet up with a bad motherfucker later on in life." "And he's somebody that you don't know." "He just broke a-loose from Ringling Brother's show." "Said he talked about your people in a hell of a way." I talked about your uncle 'til the motherfucker hair turn gray. I screwed your mother, your aunt and your niece. Even had a [inaudible] your grandma for a piece. The signifying monkey is probably the strongest tale that I tell in person. Plush shine in the great Titanic and Old Folk Hotel. They've been around 'round 50 years. As I say, told by the beer joint and liquor store wise men. "Wasn't it sad when the great Titanic went down? There was people of all races of all different kind. But there was one black motherfucker on the deck that they called Shine. He wore sweet and wild britches and broken shoes. You know that motherfucker used ta sit around all day just a singin' the blues." He's the... ice cube of the [Laughing] of the... 70's. He's Ice T. When I first started rappin' and swearin' and cursin' on records people were like they acted like I made it up. We like "naw, naw, there's other brothers that were far in the future before me that made it up." I'm just tryin' to carry on the tradition. Beastie Boys, long time, Rudy Ray Moore Dolemite fans. Pretty much we became completely Dolemite influenced and inspired. I mean he been doin' this shit for years, right? And I like I been studyin' his little style, i could take his whole style and just flip the whole shit. Dolemite is just, definite, he's was in one our videos. Called "In The Ghetto". "Why you jive turkeys, I'll knock you through Sunday and be waitin' for you on Monday. You too young to seen the sights that [inaudible] and [inaudible] about Dolemite." Uh, you have to know the fly-fucker, the pussy-maker the big-bitch-breaker. Well alright, it's Dolemite. The Legend. You motherfuckers better know. Man, I seen him as just at the Godfather you know I'm sayin'? Still out here kickin' it in 2000. Keepin' it real, just like in '73, '74 all that you know I'm sayin'? Just like that man. That nigger's just a livin' legend man, bottom line. The rappers, they've picked parts from my party records and dubbed them into their rap. Dr. Dre, the Chronic Album, Big Daddy Kane, the Taste of Chocolate, The 2-Live Crew, many albums. 31 times they sample me. I've been sampled now 80 times off my records. All that just stuck in my head trippin' on how much he influenced everythang and just how his recreation keep comin' around. You, we can't get away from him 'cuz that's our roots. Uh, Busta Rhyme he had me in an album called "When Disaster Strikes". A great album. The late great Eazy-E was my very dear friend. Any time he give something he wanted Dolemite there. You did a song with Dolemite As I call "Merry Motherfucking Christmas". It was kinda cool. And another one of the great rappers was Too Short. Too Short invited me out one night he said "I want you to come out and introduce me on my final performance." He called himself retirin', but he didn't retire. I worked with Dr. Dre. Dr. Dre had me in the Snoop Dogg video "He shoulda came alone today. He's Snoop Doggy Dog." Without Rudy Ray Moore wouldn't be no Snoop Dog. And that's real. I appear on his album before his last one called "Top Dogg No Limit". I think the young man no doubt about it is one of the truly great rappers of our time. We just sittin' here live, you know, percolating. With the man, the myth, the legend my uncle Rudy Ray Moore. Also my nephew Nate Dogg. And we doin' his DPG. Rudy Ray Moore thang, you know, givin' a special shout out, a tribute to the greatest of all time. Like I said, without him there wouldn't be no rap community. He was doin' it before we knew what to do with it. And we gon' continue to push his rim and keep it goin' on and take it to the next level. And let the young generation know what he means to this industry and what he means to this you know community that we call rap. And how we should cherish every moment that we spend with the great Rudy Ray Moore. [Cheering] [Music PLaying] I can remember talkin' about Rudy. I said "Rudy could adjust to any crowd." Uh, meaning that if a crowd wanted uh triple X material... then rudy could give it to 'em triple X. And in fact he probably had extra couple more X's in there. I first got introduced to Rudy Ray Moore, actually through uh, Richard Pryor. Richard Pryor is a fan of his. Richard likes his work. I think that, uh, Rudy gave Eddie Murphy and a lot of those comedians, uh, yeah... I think he give them courage. Eddie Murphy has Rudy Ray Moore parties. We stay up all night watching all of Rudy's films. And Eddie is insane for Rudy Ray Moore. What makes him so funny? His, he's just a comedian, he's funny. - He don't give a, he don't give a shit. - The sutff he says. - He don't! - That's what makes him so funny. Yeah, but not all comedians are funny. 'Cuz he tells the truth. Well, that's another thing. You know, you know what makes him so funny? He don't give a shit. Dolemite put it out there! "I even took some pussy from a deaf and dumb girl. [Laughter] Broke all her fangers so she couldn't tell nobody." My mother, you know, she brought me up in Sunday School and Easter and Mother's Day I would go out and uh, she'd give a poem ready for me and I would recite this poem and people say "he's gonna be a preacher". "Dolemite is my name! And rappin' and tappin' is my game. I'm the one that killed Monday, whipped Tuesday and put Wednesday in the hospital. [Laughter] Called up Thursday to tell Friday not to birth Saturday on Sunday. Stuck my finger in the ground and turned the whole world around. Him went up in a jug and beat the hell out of him with a club. I took today and brought back yesterday. Took the 4th of July and put it in June. And made Leap Year jump over the moon! [Whooping Applause] Mule has kicked me but he didn't bruise my hide. A rattlesnake bit me, they just crawled off and died. [Laughter] I picked up the rock that killed the giant Goliath and whooped Nero's ass for settin' Rome on fire! [Laughter] I ain't lyin' baby. Y'all know, y'all done seen me and heard me rap with Big Daddy Kane 2 Live Crew, Eazy-E and you heard me do Deez Nuts on Dr. Dre's album. [Cheering] But let me tell ya... all those young men are rappin' good. But when it comes down to rappin' I was through with it before they learned what to do with it! [Cheering] Yes! I'm the Godfather rap and the king of the party records. And I'd like to leave you with this. I been known to rise up but I'll cool down later. I'm the bad motor scooter, I'm the Human Tornado! [Loud Applause] Dolemite is my name and I'm out of this mother[Horn Honks]. [Cheering] "What're you gonna do and where do you go from here, Dolemite?" I returned to singin' because, let me tell ya singing was always in my blood. I sung many years ago. I made 50 different songs. And today, they're out on an album produced by Norton records in New York. I did a concert from the album at Wetlands in New York. * And I'm going up on the mountain * Face the rising sun * Find me some good cock bitches * And have myself some fun [Inaudible Singing] [Music Plays Softly] * And I love the coffee grind real slow This was a major performance for me. After 30 odd years of not singing I come back on the stage although I am great, I'm not conceded in my greatness I'm merely convinced. * I can always count on somethin' * And she keeps it hid * I got a great big dick * That I can fuck [Inaudible] 'cause [Inaudible Singing] "Say that son, say that!" * And I love the coffee grind real slow * There seems to be always * What she [inaudible] * [Inaudible] anymore * Oh anymore * Four then one is five * Five and five is ten * I'm a bad [AUDIO DROP] * [Inaudible] 'cause I'm bad [Inaudible Singing] * And I love to fuckin' grind * Real slow * It seems to be yours Now I have a new album called "Rudy Ray More Is The Soul Singer". I sing many great soul songs in it and it is going to be a knockout. Whoo! Oww! [Music Fades] Yeah I wanna see, I wanna see some some new Dolemite. Hey you motherfuckers, I'm out here with Dolemite 2000, on the set down here southern L.A. downtown. Cold as a motherfucker down here tonight. S I'm just now coming back with "the Return of Dolemite: 2002". Which is a bad mamma-jamma. [Director] Action! Ahh! Alright! You motherfuckers ain't had enough? I'm gonna have to drink my voodoo potion [AUDIO DROP] -your fuckin' ass. [Inaudible] [Spouting Gibberish] Dolemite 2002 is a vehicle that has me coming from Africa after 25 years with two sons that I fathered over there. And I was invited to come back by my sister who said "Dolemite, you know you used to keep the communities straight when you were here, and it is a mess. Now why don't you come home?" So I come back to the United States, and there I kick ass and take names. For anybody that is corrupt. You wanna play motherfuckers? Come on! Come on with it! And I'd hang a foot up their ass if they're not straight. [Grunting] And I got the martial arts scenes in it. " I got somethin' fo' your as, motherfucker! We had the director of martial arts from New York come and did the great, great fight scene for me. That's an honor to really work with him. That's a living legend in the game, you know what I'm sayin'? I just know whatever we whoever we sit down and vibe with is gonna be off the hook because it's natural, you know what I'm sayin'? You vibe, our guys just natural natural fun. And when it's like that we gonna come up with some some smash ideas, you know? Bang bang! We have a, a lot of young guys that I knew that I was the cause to get in this picture. And they're from the real school. And when I say the real school I mean the Bloods and the Crips [Gunshots] I find that's one good way to get the kids off the street to stop 'em from killing and fighting, to put them in to something more positive. And stuff like this is what they need to be doing. [Chanting] Dolemite! Dolemite! Dolemite! Dolemite! Dolemite! Dolemite! Dolemite! Dolemite! Dolemite! This is me, Rudy Ray Moore, Dolemite. "And I'm gonna let 'em know that Dolemite is back on the scene!" Rudy Ray Moore is still surviving and still carrying on and still a very important, uh, influence in our business. [Drum Music] "Im here to clear all doubts... I'm here to tell you what the fuckin' is all about. Ladies, fuckin' is not a game, it's an art. When you do it girls, you gotta do it with all your heart. Ladies, you don't have to be down under make your man think he's been struck by lightnin' and bowled by thunder! And when your pussy being to pop... [Makes Popping Sounds] [Laughter] Young man, can you make a pussy pop?" "Oh yeah, every day." "You gotta have dick to make a pussy pop, baby. You get 'em [gibbering loudly] You aughta be locked up baby. But in my room I'll eat your drawers off of you. Somebody looked at me and said "Rudy, you done got a little old." I says "Yeah" I may be too Goddamn old to cut the mustard But I can damn sure lick out the jar! [Gibbering] Black women with a lot of ass. [Gibbering] Now this is what I call a lot of ass, baby. You got the same damn thing them little skinny ones got but a damn sight more of it. If this place would catch on fire and they tell everybody to haul ass, you'd have to make 10 trips. I said "Men, sell your dicks if you can't sell 'em, leave 'em hanging." - Did I get a right on for you sir? - Yes. Yes, sir. [Laughter] Ohh... hmm. You sure you can sell it? [Laughter] You can't even give it away, let alone sell it. [Laughter] I don't know, that lady may buy some, there. [Laughter] Woo!" "[Inaudible] you're choking yourself. [Laughter] I woman's legs is her best friend, but sometimes best friends [inaudible]. [Laughter] - Can I get a right on there fellas? - [Men] Right on! I'll eat your drawers offa you. Then when I get through I'll say I do believe I ate the whole thing. [AUDIO DROP] -her that her pussy taste good as grape kool-aid. [Laughter] [Inaudible] [Inaudible] No one knows whether the nose knows when the toes is comin'. You got a dangerous lookin' tongue too, brother. I bet you'd wreck a piece of pussy. Eat all the lines out of it. [Inaudible] ain't got shit on you, [inaudible]." "You don't get on the pussy and go up and down, up and down, up and down... You learn how to stand up in the pussy. Back up off of it! And shake your ass and stroke. Make your nut fit an ass with each stroke. Be like them white fellas. [Inaudible] in nut pussy to death. Can't ya brother? Yeah, right on. [Laughter] I know I'd get a right on on ya. You brother's gotta learn how to do that. Them white's fellas get on the pussy go whap whap whap whap whap a-whap! Them long nuts... that's all they got, a hundred pounds of nuts and no dicks." "You know, this young lady was in the room with her boyfriend, you know maybe he fucked, he fucked, he fucked 'im. Know he had done it, child. He backed up off the pussy and, and looked at her he said "Bitch, I know this dick is good." She says "no motherfucker, your dick ain't no goddamn good." Say "I want you to get up out this bed," that's what he told her. "And go and fix me some food." She went in the kitchen and brought him a carrot and a head a lettuce. He said "Bitch, why you bring me this carrot and a head of lettuce?" She says "motherfucker... you fuck like a rabbit, you might as well eat like one!" "I met a young lady in a club like this the other night, she says "Rudy I want you to go home with me." I said "Baby, I don't go home with no women, I take 'em to motels." She said "Daddy we can save that $20." I said "Bitch you can't get a room at Motel 6 for $20." So I decided to go home with her. She said "honey, I ain't got no husband, come on home with me". I went home with her. Got in the bed, start wailin' on that pussy, five minutes later I heard [Knocking] I said "Bitch- [AUDIO DROP] I said "Bitch... How in the hell is anybody gonna hide in one room?" She said "nigga, jump out the window." I said "Look here woman, we on the 13th floor." She said "Motherfucker, this ain't time to be superstitious, jump!" And I know damn well I wadn't jumpin'. I put my black as up over the front door nuts hangin' down, ass out. this ugly motherfucker bust through the door, hollerin' "Bitch, what you been doin'?" She said "Nothin' daddy." He saw my nuts hangin' down over the door said "Bitch, what the fuck is that?" She said "Daddy, I went to Sears and I bought me some doorbells." He said "Doorbells?" Said "I'm gonna see if I can make these motherfuckers ring." This son of a bitch went to the closet and got a baseball bat. And drew back at my nuts and I looked down and said "Ding-dong, motherfucker!" "Ding-dong!" [Laughter] I would consider him like the king of black exploitation. The Godfather himself. Smack a bitch and stick a foot in a nigger's face. [Grunting] "Dolemite is my name" "and fuckin' up motherfuckers is my game." I would like to say to all of the young people out here that want to get a break in show business... never let your relatives and folks say that you ain't gonna be nothin', go on out and get you a job. Don't go for that. If you think you got talent I want you to develop that talent. Reach out for the moon. If you miss it, cling to a star. 'Cause there's a of of stars out there in the universe. And brothers and sisters if you do that someday, somehow your day will arrive. This is me talkin' to ya. The bad, bad, Dolemite.
