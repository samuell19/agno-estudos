(folk music) (vocalizing) - [Narrator] Written by John Mortimer. Starring Michael Hordern. And George Rose. And Leueen MacGrath with Jeanne Marsh. Directed by Stuart Burge. Produced by David Susskind. ♪ Like the birds in the wilderness ♪ ♪ Birds in the wilderness ♪ (lively flute music) (lock rustling) (metal creaking) - Is this where you keep Mr. Fowle? Good, excellent. Then leave us alone, like a good fellow. And would you mind closing the door? These old places, so drafty. Mr. Fowle. Where are you Mr. Fowle? Oh, pray heaven he has not escaped. (birds chirping) Good heavens, man, come down! Come down, Mr. Fowle. - [Herbert] What's the matter? (clamoring) What's the matter? - I haven't hurt you. - No, uh, what. - I was suddenly anxious. A man in your unfortunate position, desperate measures. I couldn't bear to lose you. (Herbert mumbles) No, don't stand up. It's difficult for you with suspenders or a belt I can see. - Yes. - And no tie, no shoelaces. I'm so glad they're looking after you. You must forgive me if I frightened you just a little, Mr. Fowle. But because when I saw you up there at the window. - I thought I could get a glimpse of the green between the chimneys and that shade. - [Wilfred] No, no, no, no, come down. It's not wise to be up there forever trying to look out. - Oh. - There's a drafty, sweeping wind, treacherous. I don't want anything like that to catch you before. - Before what? - You're much better sitting down there quietly in the warm. You sit down there quietly and I'll introduce myself. - I'm tired. - I'm Morganhall. - Morganall? - Wilfred Morganhall, the Barrister. - Oh, I'm sorry. - Why? - Well, barrister, that's very bad. - Oh, I don't know. Why is it so bad? - When a gentleman of your stamp goes wrong, oh a long fall. - What can you mean? - Well it's not so bad for an individual like me 'cause I only kept a small seed shop. - Seed shop? - Mm hmm. - My poor fellow, we mustn't let this unfortunate little case of yours confuse us. We're going to remain very calm, very lucid. - Birdseed, of course. Individuals down our way keep birds. Canaries and budgerigars. The budgies talk. There's a lot of lonely people down our way and they kept 'em for the talk. - Mr. Fowle, I am a barrister. - Oh, it's tragic. - I know the law. - It's a trap shoot. - I'm here to help you. - We'll help each other. (chuckles) - Oh I see. I see where you've been bewildered, Mr. Fowle. You think I'm in trouble as well. - Oh. - Then I've got good news for you at last, I'm free. Oh yes, I can leave here when I like. - You can? - The police are my friends. - They are? - And I've never felt better in my life. There now, that's relieved you, hasn't it? I'm not in any trouble. - Your family all well? - I never married. - Oh, rent paid up? - A week or two owing, perhaps. Temporary lull in business. This case will end all that. - Which case? - Yours, your case. - My? - Your case. - Oh, no, that's not important. - Not? - No, I don't care about it to any large extent, I mean, not as a present advised. - Mr. Fowle, how could you say that? - The flavor's all gone out of it. - But we're only at the beginning. - I can't believe it's me concern. - Ah but it is you, Mr. Fowle. You must never let yourself forget that. You see, that's why you're here. - I can't seem to bother with it. - [Wilfred] Well, can you be so busy? - Slopping in, slopping out and peering out at the green trees, it fills in the day. - You seem, if I may say so to have adopted an unpleasantly selfish attitude. - Selfish? - Dog in the manger. - Non-enthusiastic. - Well, you're speaking quite frankly, I will appreciate it. - I'm sorry Mr. Fowle, but you made me say it. There's so much of this about nowadays. So much ready-made entertainment. Free billiards, socialized medicine, television. There's not the spirit abroad that there used to be. - You feel that? - Anything that I've done I've always been mustard keen on my work. Year after year, Fowle, my window at college was alight until 2 a.m. I fed mainly on herrings. - But bookwork almost entirely. I'm only assuming that, of course. - You want to hear some Latin? - Well, only if you have time. (speaking in foreign language) - [Wilfred] Do you understand it? - I'm no scholar. - No, you most certainly are not, but I had to be. Oh yes, we all had to be in my day. Many examinations. Rowing men fainting, Indian students vomiting with fear. And after the exams, months of waiting, nerve-wracking. Then comes the fatal postcard. - What's it say? - Satisfied the examiners. I told the only lady in my life that in five years time perhaps. - You'd arrived. - That's what I thought when they painted my name up on my London chambers. I sat down to fill in the time until they sent me my first brief in a real case. I sat down to do the crossword puzzle while I waited. And five years later, Fowle, what was I doing? - Oh, well, a little case of high treason. - I was still doing the crossword puzzle. - Oh, but better at it? - Not much, not very much. As the years passed there come to be clues that you no longer understand. - [Herbert] So all that training? - Wasted, the talents rust, you know. - [Herbert] And the lady? - Drove an ambulance in the 1914. A stray piece of shrapnel took her. I don't care to talk about it. - [Herbert] Tragic. - It was. - Tragic my wife was never called up for service. - Oh Fowle, you mustn't talk like that. Your poor wife. - Oh, don't let's carry on about me. - But we must carry on about you, that's what I'm here for. - Well you're here to? - To defend you. - Can't be done. - Why ever not? - [Herbert] I know who killed her. - Who? - Me. (chuckles) - Mr. Fowle. I have all the respect in the world for your opinions but we must face this, you're a man of very little education. - Agreed, quite frankly. - You think that you killed your wife. - Oh, it seems so to me. - Mr. Fowle, Mr. Fowle. Look at yourself objectively. In matters of birdseed I have no doubt you may be infallible. But on a vital point like this, might you not be mistaken? Don't answer. - Why not sir? - Before you drop the bomb of a reply consider who will be wounded. Are the innocent to suffer? I've waited years for this. - But I was only trying to be honest. - But you're a criminal, Mr. Fowle. You've broken through the narrow fabric of honesty. You are free to be kind, human, to do good. - What I did to her. - [Wilfred] She's past, you know, out of your life. You'll set up new relationships. You picked out me. - Picked out? - Selected. - Well I didn't know. - No, Mr. Fowle, you didn't know me. That's the whole beauty of it. You came to me under a system of chance invented like the football pools to iron out the harsh inequalities of a world where you have to deserve success. You, Mr. Fowle, are my first dock brief. - Your dock brief? You couldn't explain, could you? - Yes, yes of course. Criminals with no money and no friends exist. Luckily you're one of them. They are entitled to choose any barrister from among those sitting in court to defend them. And the barrister, however old, gets a brief. And is remunerated, Mr. Fowle, on a modest scale. Busy lawyers, wealthy lawyers, men with other interests creep out of court bent double when a dock brief is chosen. But we regulars who are not busy, sit on. I've been a regular for years. - Yes. - It's not there to catch, you see. Even if you want the work, to wave at the prisoner or to whistle, or to try and catch his eye by hoisting any sort of little flag. - Oh, I didn't know. - But you can choose the most advantageous seat. The seat any criminal would naturally point at. It's the seat under the window. And for 10 years, my old friend Tuppy Morgan has bagged that seat, every morning at 10 a.m. There he sits, reading Horace writing his innumerable aunts. And almost once a year, a criminal points him out. So Christopher. Tuppy stuck like a leech on that seat. (Herbert chuckles) But this morning, something, perhaps a cold, possibly death kept him indoors, and I had his place. (chuckling) And you spotted me, no doubt. - Spotted you? - Yes, my glasses polished. My profile drawn and learned in front of the great window. - I never noticed. - But when they asked you to chose a lawyer. - I shut me eyes and pointed. I've picked out football teams that way, and horses. Never did me any good, though, by any stretch of the imagination. - So even you, Fowle, didn't choose me. - Not altogether. - The law's a haphazard business. - But that seemed chancy. - Years of training and then to be picked out like a football pool. - Oh, now I'm sorry I told you. - Oh nevermind, nevermind. You hurt me temporarily, Fowle, I must admit. But now that's done. Might have been kinder to have kept me in darkness. Now let's get down to business, thank you. And Fowle? - Yes. - Remember that you're dealing with a fellow man. A man no longer young. Remember the hopes I've pinned on you and try. - Try. - Try to spare me more pain. - [Herbert] I will sir, of course I will. - Good, good. Now, let's get our minds in order. - Get things sorted out, eh? (Wilfred chuckles) - Yes, exactly. Now, this wife of yours. - Doris. - Doris, a bitter, unsympathetic woman? - No, she was always cheerful. She loved jokes. - Fowle, do be very careful. - I will, sir, but if you'd known Doris. She laughed harder than she worked. "Thank heaven," she's say. "For my Old English sense of fun." - What sort of jokes, Fowle, did this Doris appreciate? - All sorts, pictures in the paper. Jokes on the wireless set. Laughs from party surprises. She'd keep 'em from Christmas to Christmas and trot them out in August. - [Wilfred] You couldn't share it? - No, not to that extent, no. I always missed the funny point. - [Wilfred] And then you'd quarrel. - "Don't look so miserable, it may never happen." Oh, she said that to me every night when I came home. "Where'd you get that miserable expression from, eh?" - Yes, I can see it now. There is a sort of Sunday evening appearance to you. - I was quite happy. But it was always "cat got your tongue, eh? "Where's the funeral? "Oh, look at old fiddle face. "Let's play a tune on it, shall we? "Well, it's lucky one of us here can see the funny side." Then we had to have tea with the wireless on so she could hear more jokes. - [Wilfred] And you're not a wireless lover. - No, not to that extent. I couldn't always see the funny point. But she'd be bent double over the table gasping as if her lungs were full of water. "Laugh," she'd holler. "Damn you, what you got to be so miserable about?" Then she'd go under, bubbling like a drowning woman. - [Wilfred] Made meals difficult. - Oh, indigestible. Course even our names was misfortunate. - [Wilfred] Your names? - Fowle. - Oh. - Going down the aisle she said to me "Now we're cock and hen, aren't we, old bird?" And coming away it was "Now I'm Mrs. Fowle, you'll have to play fair with me." Oh she laughed so hard they couldn't get her straightened up for the photograph. - [Wilfred] Fond of puns, I gather you're trying to say. - Any sort of joke. I had a little aviary down at the bottom of my garden and as she got funnier, I spent more time with my birds. Budgerigars are small parrots. Circles around their eyes give them a sad, tired look. - [Wilfred] You found them sympathetic. - Um, restful. - Yes. - Until one of them spoke out at me. - Spoke, what words? - "Don't look so miserable, it might never happen." - The bird said that? - Yeah, she taught it during the day when I was out at work. Course it didn't mean to irritate. - It was wrong of her, of course, to lead on your bird. - Yes, but it wasn't the bird that drove me to it. It was Bateson. - Bateson? - The lodger. - Bateson, the, another man? - At long last. - I see it all, a crime of passion. An unfaithful wife. (speaking in foreign language) Of course you don't understand. - No. - We'll get it reduced to manslaughter right away. A wronged husband and there's never a dry eye in the jury box. You came in and caught them. - They was always laughing together. - Maddening. - He knew more jokes than she did. - And stealing her before your eyes. - That's what I thought. He was a big man, ex-policeman. He said he'd been the scream of the station. I picked him specially for her. On the notice I put up in local sweet shop I wrote "humorous type of lodger wanted." - Oh, wasn't that rather a risk? - Oh, slight, perhaps, but it went all right. Two days after he came, he poised a bag of flour to fall on her in the kitchen. Then she sewed up the legs of his pajamas. Oh, they had to hold on to each other so as not to fall over laughing. "Oh, look at old fiddle face over there. "He can never see anything subtle." - It's galling for you, terribly galling. - I thought it was going all right. I spent more time in my birds. I came home late and I was always careful to scratch me feet in the gravel at the front door. I went to bed early and left them with the wireless set. On Sunday morning, I fed the birds and I suggested he took her tea in bed. "Laughter," she read out of her horoscope. "Laughter leads to love, especially for them born "under the sign of the Virgin." - You trusted them and they deceived you. - They deceived me all right. And I trusted them to do the right thing. Especially when I saw her sitting on his knee and both of them laughing up their fannies in my own evening paper. - Mr. Fowle, I'm not quite getting the drift of your evidence. It's my hope that it won't prove a shade too involved for our literal-minded judge. - When he first put his knee under her I thought he'd do the decent thing. I thought I'd have peace in my little house at last. The wireless set dead silent. The end of all that happy laughter. No sound but the twitter from the end of the garden and the squeak of my own foot on the linoleum. - You wanted? - I heard them whispering together and my hopes raised high. When I came back he was gone. - [Wilfred] She didn't. - She turned him out, said he was getting overtly familiar. "Oh, I couldn't have that," she said, "oh no. "I may like my laugh "but thank heaven I'm still respectable, oh no thank you. "There's safety in marriage "so I'm stuck with you old fiddle face. "Let's play a tune on it, shall we?" She'd sent him away, my last hope. - So you. (Herbert quacks) - Of course, I realize I did wrong. - Well, you could have left. - But who'd have fed the birds? That thought was uppermost. (Wilfred sighs) - So it's not a crime of passion. - Oh, no, not if you put it like that. - Mr. Fowle. I've worked and waited for you. Now you're the only case I've got and the most difficult. - I'm sorry. - A man could crack his head against a case like you and still be far from a solution. Can't you see how 12 honest hearts will snap like steel when they learn that you finished off your wife because she wouldn't leave you? - If she had of left me, there wouldn't have been the need. - Yes, yes, as I look at you now I can see that you're an unsympathetic figure. - Well, there it is. - Yes, it will take a brilliant stroke to save you. An unexpected move. Something pulled out of a hat. I've got it. - Yeah. - Something really exciting. The surprise witness. - Witness? - Picture the scene, Mr. Fowle. The courtroom's silent, the jury about to sink you. The prosecution flushed with victory. Then I arise. My voice a hoarse whisper, exhausted by that long trial. My Lord, if Your Lordship pleases. - Whatcha saying now? - Well good heavens, Fowle. You don't expect me to do this off the cuff, do you? Without any sort of rehearsal? - No. - Well come along then, cooperate? Come on. - On that stool. - [Wilfred] On the stool. Well now, sit down. Yes, and this towel over your head to simulate the dirty gray wig. Yes, already you look anonymous and vaguely alarming. Now Fowle. - Yes. - Forget your own personality. You are a judge of the High Court, Sir Tommy Banter. In love with capital punishment, corporal punishment and a younger brother, accomplished at embroidery. A small, alarmed man. A man without friends unexpectedly adored by a great niece, three-years old. - Well, I am? - Him. - It feels strange. - My Lord. I ask Your Lordship's leave to call the surprise witness. - Oh certainly. - What? - Certainly. - Good heavens Fowle, this is like practicing bullfights with a kitten. Here's an irregular application by the defense. Something that may twist the trial in the prisoner's favor and prevent you catching your evening train home. - Oh. - No, blind yourself with rage and terrible justice. - No, you can't call the surprise witness, get on with it. - Oh My Lord, if Your Lordship would listen to me. - No, certainly not, you've had your chance. - My Lord, justice must not only be done but must clearly be seen. It will be done. Who knows what my surprise witness may say. Perhaps he will say that the prisoner is guilty in his black heart, as your lodger thinks. Although perhaps, members of the jury. We have trapped an innocent. If so, are we to deny him the one door through which he may walk to freedom? The public outcry would never die down. - Hear, hear. (wood rattling) - [Wilfred] What's that? - The public outcry. - Oh good, good, excellent. Now, towel back on, you're the judge. - Silence, I'll have those noisy people put out. All right, call your witness but keep it short. - Now, deathly silence. - Yeah. - As the witness walks through the breathless crowds. Now. Let's see the witness. - Oh. - Yes, well take the towel off. - Oh yes. I swear to tell the truth. - Yeah, you seem to have a real feeling for the law. - The whole truth. - What a pity you came to it so late in life. - And nothing but the truth. - Now, what is your name? - Herbert Fowle. - You're the witness. - Martin Jones. - Good, good, excellent. Now, you know Herbert Fowle. - Yeah I do. - [Wilfred] Always found him respectable. - Yes, a very quiet spoken man, and clean living. - Where was he when this crime took place? - [Herbert] He was. - Just a moment, My Lord. Would Your Lordship sharpen a pencil and note this down? - You dare say that to him? - Fearlessness, Mr. Fowle, the first essential in an advocate. Is Your Lordship's pencil poised? - Yes, yes, yes, get on with it. - Where was he? - [Herbert] Um, in my house. - All the evening? - Yes, playing Whist. I came for him and we left leaving Mrs. Fowle well and happy. When we returned, she'd been removed to the County Hospital. - Panic stows the prosecution benches. The prosecutor tries a few fumbling questions but you stand your ground. - Oh I do, yes. - My Lord, I demand that the prisoner be released. - Certainly, release the prisoner. I can't think what all this fuss has been about. And have all police officers in court reduced to the rank of Constable. (Herbert chuckles) (Wilfred sighs) (Wilfred chuckles) - Well Fowle. - Yes sir. - Aren't you going to thank me? - Well, I don't know what to say. - Words don't come easily to you, do they? - No, very hard. - Well you could just stand and stammer in a touching sort of way and offer me that old, gold watch of your father's. - Yes, but I. - Well, I think we've pulled your chestnut out of the fire. We must just make sure that this fellow Jones. - Yes but. - Yes, you're a good chap, Fowle, but don't interrupt my thinking. - Yes, but we have no Jones. - What, carried off in the cold spell? We'll get his statement in under the Evidence Act. - He never lived, we made him up. - Fowle. - Yes. - Remarkable thing, but with no legal training I believe you put your finger on a fatal weakness in our defense. - Yes, I was afraid it might be the case. - Yes it is the case. - So, we'd better give in. - Give in? We will not give in, when my life depends on this case. - Oh, I forgot, then we'll try again. - Yes, yes, brain, brain, get to work. Oh, it will come to me, you know, in an illuminating flash. Hard, relentless brainwork. This is the way I go through crosswords, I never give up. I've got it, Bateson. - The lodger? - Bateson, the lodger, I never liked him. Under a ruthless cross-examination, you know, he might confess that it was he. (chuckles) You see the flash. - Well, you look happier. - I am, much happier. And when I begin my ruthless cross-examination. - Would you care to try it? - Mr. Fowle, you and I are learning to muck in splendidly over this. - Now Bateson. - Yes, sir. - Perhaps you'll be good enough to take your hands out of your pockets when you address the court. - Ah, you see, I'm. - No, Mr. Fowle, not you of course. (chuckles) Now Bateson. - Yes, sir. - You were on friendly terms with the prisoner's wife? - [Herbert] We had one or two good, old laughs together. (Herbert laughs) - The association was entirely innocent? - Innocent laughs, jokes without offense. The funny ad or Christmas card variety. Jokes that would not have shamed a postcard. - Um, and to tell these innocent jokes. Did you have to sit very close to Mrs. Fowle? - [Herbert] Well, how do you mean? - Did you have to sit beneath her? - [Herbert] I don't understand. - Did she perch upon your knee? - Oh! - What's that? - Shocked breathing from the jury. - What, oh, having it's effect, eh? Bateson, will you kindly answer my question? - [Herbert] You're trying to trick me. - Not trying, Bateson, succeeding. - Well, she may have rested on my knee once or twice. - And you loved her, guiltily. - [Herbert] I may. - And wanted to take her away with you. - [Herbert] I did ask her. - And when she refused. - Just a minute. - Now, now, now, where is all this leading? - Your Lordship asks me. (scoffs) My Lord, it is our case that it was this man, Bateson enraged by the refusal of the prisoner's wife to go away with him, who struck. - Oh! (Wilfred chortles) - See where we've got to. - Yes, I do. - Masterly, I think you'll agree. - Of course. - No flaws in this one. - Well, perhaps not a flaw, sir, just a little hitch. - Hitch, hitch? Go on, break it down. - Oh no sir, not when you've been so kind. - Oh, nevermind, all my life I've stood against the winds of criticism and neglect. I'm used to hardship. Speak on, Mr. Fowle. - Well, soon as Bateson left my house he was picked up by a police officer. He'd lifted an alarm clock off of me and the remains of a bottle of port. They booked him in straight away. - What, you mean there wasn't time? - Well, hardly. And two hours afterwards the lady next door saw Mrs. Fowle at the washing. And then I came home. - Fowle. - Yes? - Do you want to help me? - Well of course I do, sir, haven't I shown it? - But you will keep putting all these difficulties in my way. - See, I know you'd be upset. - No, not really. After all, I am a grown-up, and even an old man. At my age, one expects little gratitude. I'm not bitter, but just a little help just a very little encouragement. - Yeah, but you'll win this case, sir. A brilliant mind like yours. - Yes, thank heaven it is a very brilliant mind. - And all that training. - Years of it. Hard, hard training. - You'll solve it soon. (Wilfred grumbles) - Fowle. - Yes. - Do you know what I've heard Tuppy Morgan say? After all, he's sat here in court year-in, year-out waiting for the dock brief himself. "Wilfred," he's frequently said to me. "Wilfred, old fellow. "If they ever do offer you a brief "attack the medical evidence." - [Herbert] Ah! - "Remember the jury's full of rheumatism and arthritis "and shocking gastric troubles. "They love to see a medical man put through it. "Always go for a doctor." - Well, should we try it? - Shall we? - I'd enjoy it. - Doctor, do you tell me that the lady died of heart failure? - [Herbert] No. - Come, Doctor. Don't fence with me, her heart was not normal when you examined her was it? - She was dead. - So it has stopped? - Well. - So her heart had failed. - Yes but. - So she died of heart failure. And heart failure might have been brought on by a fit. I say, a fit of laughter at a curiously rich joke on the wireless. (whistling) (Herbert claps) (Wilfred grumbles) - Thank you Fowle. It was kind of you, but I thought a little hollow. I don't believe my attack on the doctor was convincing. - Well, a bit unlikely, but clever. - Yeah, too clever. We're not going to win this on science now. Science must be thrown away. As I was asking those questions I could see that I was not even convincing you of your own innocence. But, you respond to emotion, Fowle. As I do. The magic of oratory. The wonderful power of words. - Ah, now you're talking. - And I shall talk. - Oh, I wish I could hear some of it. Words as grand as print. - A golden tongue, a voice like a lyre to charm you out of hell. - Now you're commencing to wander away from all I've understood. - I was drawing on the riches of my classical education. Comforts me on buses. Waiting in doctor's surgeries and prison cells. But I shall speak to the jury simply. Without classical allusion. And I shall say, I shall say. - Yeah. - I shall say. - What? - Had it on the tip of my tongue. - Oh. - Oh, I shan't disappoint you. I shall speak for a day. Perhaps two days. - Oh I wish I could hear it. - And at the end, I shall say. - Just the final speech. - The final speech. - To clinch the argument. - Yes, the final, irrefutable argument. - Oh, I wish I could hear it. - Oh, you shall. You shall hear it in court. It will come out in court. And then, when I sink back into my seat trembling and wipe the real tears from my glasses. - The judge is summing up. - [Wilfred] What will Tommy say? - Members of the jury. - Struggling with emotions. - Oh yes, yeah. Members of the jury. (sniffling) I can not add anything to what the barrister has said. (sniffling) Go out and consider your verdict. (Wilfred sighs) - Have they left the box? - Well, it's only a formality. - Yes, I see. (chuckling) I wonder how long they'll be out? (whistling) They're out a long time. - Well, I expect it seems a long time to you, sir. The suspense. - Well I hope they're not going to disagree. - Oh, I don't see how they can. Here, they're coming back. - Members of the jury, have you considered your verdict? - [Herbert] We have. - Do you find the prisoner guilty or not guilty? - [Herbert] Not guilty. (Wilfred shouting) - Hooray, hooray, hooray! (laughing) - Now, now, now, now, now, no more monkeying about or I'll have the court cleared. (laughing) - So I'm surrounded, mobbed. Tuppy Morgan rings my hand and says it was a good thing that he left the seat. The judge sends me a letter of congratulation. The journalists all dart off to their little telephones. And what now? Of course they'd make you a judge only I suppose you're too busy. Queues of solicitors on my stairs. My old clerk writes on my next brief 1,000 guineas to divorce a duchess. Questions of new clothes. Laying down the port. Oh, Mr. Fowle, change in life that you have brought me. - It'll be your greatest day. - Yes, Mr. Fowle. (metal clanging) My greatest day, what's this, what? Oh no, I said we weren't to be interrupted. Oh, it's drafty in here. No, shut the door again, do it, there's a good chap. - I think, you know, they want us for the trial. - Huh? (melancholy woodwind music) (Wilfred grumbles) - Oh. - Hmm? (upbeat woodwind music) (melancholy woodwind music) (metal creaking) - You say he's with the Governor at the moment? Then I'll wait for him. Poor soul, how's he taken it? Ah, of course, you're not allowed to answer questions. Regulations, I suppose. One must obey the regulations. Well, I'll just sit down and wait for Mr. Fowle. (whistling) If it please you My Lord, I must urge you. I should have said, if it please you My Lord. Members of the. You know, I should have said members of the jury, is there one of you who does not crave for peace, crave for peace? The silence of an undisturbed life. The dignity of an existence without dependents. Without jokes. Have you never been tempted? I should have said members of the jury, you and I are men of the world. If Your Lordship would kindly not interrupt my speech to the jury, I'm obliged. Members of the jury, before I was so rudely interrupted. No, I should have said. Look at the prisoner, members of the jury. Has he ever hurt you? Done you the slightest harm? Is he not indeed the mildest of men? He merely took it upon himself to regulate his domestic affairs. An Englishman's home is his castle. Is there one of you, members of the jury who feels a primitive urge to be revenged on this gentle bird fancier? Now, I see that I'm affecting your emotions members of the jury. But let us consider the weight of the evidence. I might have said that. I might have said, I might have said something. - I was hoping you'd find time to drop in, sir. (Wilfred sniffling) Oh, you're upset. - No, no my dear chap. I'm not at all upset. - The result of the trial's upset you. - I feel a little dashed, a little out of sorts. - It was disappointing for you. - Oh, a touch of disappointment. There'll be other cases. There may be other cases. - But you had set such high hopes on this one. - But there it is. - Well, it doesn't do to expect too much of a particular thing. - You're right there. - Year after year, I look forward keenly to the Feathered Friends Fanciers Annual Dinner. - Your yearly treat. - Exactly, yeah. All I had in the enjoyment line. I used to build high hopes on it. June the 13th, I'd think now there's an evening to look forward to. - Something to live for. - In a way, but. You know, when it came, it was never up to it. Your collar was too tight or the food was inadequate or someone had a nasty row with the fancier in the chair so on June the 14th I always said to myself thank heaven for a nice night at home. - It came and went, and your life didn't change. - No, quite frankly. - No and my life hasn't changed after this case. - Oh don't say that, sir. - Tuppy Morgan's back in his old seat under the window. The judge never congratulated me. Nobody's rung up to offer me a brief. I thought my old clerk looked coldly at me. There was a titter in the luncheon room when I ordered my usual roll and tomato soup. (sniveling) - Yes, but you see sir, I'm. - You're not left in a very favorable position. - Oh, it doesn't matter about me, sir. After all, I never had no education. - So many years before I could master the Roman law relating to the ownership of chariots. - [Herbert] Wasted, you think? - I feel so. - But without that rich background would an individual have been able to sway the court as you did? - Sway? - The court. - Did I do that? - Oh, it struck me you did. - Indeed. - Well, I owe it all to you to where I am. - I'm afraid, near the end. - No, just commencing. - I lost, Mr. Fowle. You may not be aware of it. It may not have been hammered home to you yet. But your case is lost. - But there are ways and ways of losing. - Oh, that's true, of course. - Oh, I noticed your artfulness right from the start when the policeman was giving evidence. You pulled that red handkerchief out of your pocket slowly and deliberately like a conjuring trick. - And blew. - A sad, terrible trumpet. - Unnerved him, I thought. - Oh, he was no good after that. No court would ask him an questions after that. - And then when they called that doctor. - You were right not to bother with him. - Tactics, you see. We decided not to trouble with science. - Yes, so we had, yes. And Bateson. - Yeah, no, I must be wary of your flattery. I think I might have asked Bateson. - No, it wouldn't have made a farthing's difference. One glance told him he was a demon. - Yes, he stood there so big and red with his no tie and dirty collar. - Yes. - I rose up to question him and suddenly it seemed to me there was no reason for us to converse. - No, no. - What had he and I in common? (scoffed) I remembered what you told me about his jokes. His familiarity with your wife. - Yes. - I turned from him in disgust. (chortles) I think that jury gets the reason for my silence with friend Bateson. - [Herbert] Yeah, I think they did. - But when it came to the speech. - [Herbert] Oh, the finest stroke of all. - I can't agree, you no longer carry me with you. - Spoken from the heart. - Yes, I'm sure Fowle, but not dare I say altogether justified. We can't pretend, can we, that the speech was a success. - We won the day. - I beg you to be under no illusions. They found you guilty. - Oh yes, I was forgetting. But it was a masterly speech. - No, I can't be hoodwinked. I stood up, Mr. Fowle, and it was the moment I'd waited for. Ambition had driven me to it. The moment I was alone with what I wanted. Everyone turned to me, 12 blank faces in the jury box eager to have that grumpy look wiped off them. The judge was silent. The prosecutor courteously pretended to be asleep. I only had to open my mouth and pour words out. And what stopped me? - What? - Fear, that's what's been suggested. That's what the clerks tittered to the waitresses in the luncheon room. Old Wilf Morganhall was in a funk. - More shame on them. - But it wasn't so. Nor did my mind go blank. When I stood up I knew exactly what I was going to say. - [Herbert] Then why? - Not say it, you were going to ask. - Well it had struck me. - It must have, Fowle. It must have struck many people. You'll forgive a reminiscence. - Glad of one. - The lady that I happened to mention yesterday. I don't of course often speak of her. - She, who in the 1914 War. (Herbert spritzes) - Exactly. - Hmm. - I lost her long before that. For years, you know Mr. Fowle, this particular lady and I met at tea parties, tennis and so on. And then, one evening, I walked home with her. We stood upon Vauxhall Bridge. It was a warm summer night and the silence fell. It was the moment I should have spoken. The obvious moment. But something came over me. It wasn't fear or shyness then. But (sighs) a tremendous exhaustion. I was tired out with the long wait. And when the opportunity came all I could think of was sleep. - Oh it's a relief. - Yes, to go home alone and undress. Knock out your pipe, clean your teeth and not to bother with failure or success. - So, yesterday. - I'd lived through that moment so many times. It happened every day in my mind, daydreaming, you know. Buses and doctor's surgeries. When it came, I was tired of it. The exhaustion came over me, I wanted it to be all over. I wanted to alone in my room, in the darkness with a soft pillow around my ears. So I failed. - [Herbert] Oh don't say that. - Being too tired to make my daydream public. It's a nice day, summer's coming. I think I shall retire from the bar. - [Herbert] Oh don't say that, sir. What, after all that rigorous training? - Well it is, I think I shall retire. - Come on sir, cheer up. There'll be other cases, other days. Now let's take this thing very calmly. Look, let's be very lucid. - Other cases, I'm getting on you know. And Tuppy Morgan's back in his old seat under the window. I doubt if the dock brief will come around again. - There'll be other things. - What can there be? Unless. - Yes? - There would be another brief if I advised you to appeal. - Well now there, misfortunately I. - Ah it was a different atmosphere up there in the appeal court, Fowle. It's far from the rough and tumble, question and answer swear on the Bible and lie your way out. It's quiet up there, pure law of course. - Yes sir but you see. - Yes. I think I'm cut out for the Court of Appeal. - Uh, Mr. Morganhall. - A big, quiet court in the early summer afternoon. Piles of books. And when you put one down, the dust and powdered lead arises and makes the usher sneeze. And the clock ticks. Three old judges in scarlet take snuff with trembling hands. - Yes, you see sir. - You'll sit in the dark and not understand a legal word. And I'll give them all my law. And get you off on a technicality. - Yes sir, but. - Now, if I may remind Your Lordship, Sir Prickle against the Haverford West Justices ex parte anger reported in 96 of Moore's Ecclesiastical at page 1,003. Have Your Lordship the report? Lord Bradwell, a Chief Justice, says. At the foot of the page. "The guilty intention is a deep foundation stone "in the wall of our jurisprudence." Now it be that Prickle did run the bailiff through with his poniard believing him to be a stray cat or dog. Then there might be raised the plea of autrefois mistake. But contra. If he took him to be his neighbor's cat then, as my brother Breadwinkle has well said in Lord Roachan Anderson there might fall out a constructive larceny and (speaking in foreign language). Oh, Mr. Fowle. I have some of these fine cases by heart. - It's far above me, I'm afraid you're going now. - Oh yes, of course I am. These cases always bore the prisoner until they're upheld or overruled and he goes out dead or alive at the end of it all. No, thank heavens I kept my books. I shall open them up and I shall say. I shall say. - It's no good. - What's no good? - It's no good appealing. - No good? - No good at all. - Mr. Fowle, I've worked hard for you. - Truly nice sir. - And I intend to go on working. - It's a great comfort. - In the course of our close and may I say it, yes, our happy collaboration on this little crime of yours I've become almost fond of you. - Oh, thank you sir. - But first I have to admit I was somewhat put off by your furtive and repulsive appearance. But as we worked on this case together an affection sprang up. - Mutual. - You seem to me to have a real desire to help. And if I may say so, an instinctive taste for the law. - Well a man can't go through this sort of thing, sir, without getting legal interest. - Quite so, but just at the beginning I did notice some flaws in you as a client. - Flaws? - Yes, you may not care to admit it but let's be honest. After all, we don't want to look on the dreary side but you may not be with us for very long. - Yes sir, but that's what I'm trying to tell you. - No, no, don't interrupt the speech. Not until we've cleared this out of the way. Now didn't you, just at the beginning put some unnecessary difficulties before us. - Did I? - Oh yes. I well remember, before I got a bit of keenness into you that you seemed about to admit your guilt. - Oh! - Just a little obstinate, wasn't it? - Well I daresay. - And now! After I spent 50 years getting the law at my fingertips I hear you mutter "no appeal." - No appeal. - Mr. Fowle. - Look, sir. Yesterday you asked me to spare you pain. This is gonna be very hard for me. As you say, we've worked together and I've had the pleasure of watching the ticking over of a legal mind. Now, if you'd like to call any afternoon, sir I'd like to return the complement by showing you my birds. - Not in this world, you must realize, unless we appeal. - You see, this morning I saw the Governor. - You had some complaint? - Well, I don't want to boast but as a matter of fact, he sent for me. - Hm, you went in fear and. - Trembling, yes sir. (Wilfred grumbling) But he turned out to be a very gentlemanly sort of individual. Ex-Army, I should think. He had all the ornaments of a gentleman. His wife and children in a tinted photo in a frame on his desk and a handsome picture of a prize pig over the mantelpiece. Healthy, red face and a strong smell of scented soap. - Yes, row to the point. - Well, I'm telling you, sir. Well, Fowle, he says. Sit down, I'm just finishing this letter. So I sat down and looked out of his windows. Oh, great big windows in the Governor's office sir, and the view. - Fowle, if this anecdote has any point be a good chap and reach it. - Yes, I will sir, where was I? - Admiring the view as usual. - Oh, panoramic it was. And "Well, Fowle," he says, finishing his letter and lighting up one of them flat-type Egyptian cigarettes. "Well, Fowle," he says. - Yes, yes, yes, Fowle. It's not necessary to reproduce every word of the conversation. Just give us the meat, the gist, you understand? Leave out the trimmings. - The trimmings they weren't, sir. He put it quite bluntly. - Yes, but what did he put? - "Well, Fowle," he said, "this may surprise you "but the Home Office has been on the telephone about you." That's a government department, isn't it? - Yes, yes, yes, well, what? - Well it seems in his words that they do come through from time to time only on business, of course, on that telephone. Well he admitted he was as shocked as I was but the truth of the matter is a reprieve. (Wilfred gasps) - [Herbert] Yeah, it's all over, I'm free. It seems that trial was no good at all. - Oh God, why? - Oh, no particular reason. - There must be a reason. Nothing passes in the law without a reason. - [Herbert] Do you really want to hear this? - Certainly. - Well, he may have been joking. There was a twinkle most likely in his eye. - [Wilfred] But he said. - He said the barrister they chose for me was no good, no good at all. An old crock, in his words. That he never said a word in my defense and so my case never got to the jury. That it was ever so null and void but that I'd better be careful in future. But don't you see, sir. Look, if I'd had a clever barrister who made speeches I'd be dead as mutton. Your artfulness saved me. The damn tactics, they paid off, I'm alive. - Yes, there is that. - And so are you. - We both are. - I'm free. - To go back to your birds. I suppose. - Yes, Mr. Morganhall. - It's unlikely that you'll marry again. - Mm, unlikely. - But, still, you have the clear appearance of a criminal. I suppose it's not impossible that you might commit some other rather more trivial offense. - Well a man can't live without committing some trivial offense almost daily. - So we may meet again. You may need my services. - Constantly. - So the future may not be so black. - The sun's shining. - Can we go? - I think the door's been open for some time. Oh, after you, Mr. Morganhall. - No. - Oh, yes, yes. A gentleman of your education should go first. - No, I think you should lead the way. And as your legal advisor, I will follow at a discreet distance, to iron out such little tangles as you may hope to leave in your wake. Let's go. (Herbert chuckles) (cheerful whistling)
