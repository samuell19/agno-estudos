Hey, Nicole, you better talk to me. How come you didn't (mumbling)? I called. I left a bunch of messages on that stupid machine of yours. - What the hell is the matter with you, Ivan? Get off the stage! - Don't you talk to me that way, you stupid bitch! (shouting) - I got a cut. Nurse? Are you a nurse? - No but it doesn't look too bad. I bet we could bandage it up. Uh, can I help you up? - Yeah, sure. - Thanks. (rock music) Whoops, excuse me. Is this a painting or were you cleaning your brushes? - Oh, that? That was during my angry period. - Don't apologize, I like it. It's truly angry. Why do you have so much stuff on your walls? - You don't like it? - Oh no, I like, well, it's a bit much. Doesn't it make you a little crazy. - Well, see. When I was a kid, my father used to yell at me for putting holes in the walls from tacking things up so I promised myself at a very young age that when I got my own apartment, I was gonna put things up wherever I please. - You've got so much space. A lot of neat things. I'm visiting my sister. Her place just isn't this neat. - You like Boston? - It's okay. It's kind of lonely sometimes. Especially 'cause I haven't made friends yet. - You want a beer or something? - No thanks. Did you want me to leave? - No, I just thought you were leaving 'cause you were standing up. - Not standing up. (laughing) - I enjoyed your performance. - [Nicole] It's cool. - I wanna know why you changed the locks on the apartment, Nicole. I can't get in. - [Nicole] That's the whole idea, Ivan. Now go away and leave me alone. - You're killing me, you know that, you bitch? - Come on, Ivan. Can't you take a hint? I don't want you anymore. - You really do wanna end it, don't you, Nicole? Why? I haven't hit you in a long time. - You're a loser, Ivan. You'll never amount to anything. - I guess you think you're hot shit now that you've screwed your way to the top. - Bastard! I only screwed that one booking agent! - You did? He didn't even get you any gigs! Oh! - Hey, it's pretty sick hitting a lady. Ow, my hand! (groaning) - Ivan? Are you okay? - [Ivan] Open the door, you chickenshit pussies! - Are you having an asthma attack? - [Ivan] Yeah, I'm probably dying but what do you care? (gasping) - I have a spray in my travel bag. - [Ivan] Ah, go to hell, it's too late. (smashing) - [Martin] It must be exciting being the sister of a rock star. - [Samantha] Yeah. - Look, you sure you don't want a beer or some wine or something? I could make you a meatball sandwich. - No thanks. - Now you are leaving. - No, I really need to check on Nicole. - The gigs are great, aren't they? I mean, for me, they're the best part of a relationship. Energy's so high and there's always so much hope here. - Well, they make me nervous. - Are you okay? - Yeah. - Well listen, Sam. I really enjoyed it. - You enjoyed being thrown off the stage by a maniac? - I really did. Not the fight. All the other stuff. (mumbling) Why don't we get together again? Soon. Like tonight in about 45 minutes. Why don't you stay? Look, I can run out to the corner store-- - Marty, can I call you Marty? - Oh yeah. - Not tonight, I've really gotta go, okay? Bye. - Bye. (clinking) - God bless you, sir. God bless you anyway, sir. (mumbling) thinks I'm out here for my health. - Hey Wally, how's it going? - Ah, I'm getting nowhere out here, Martin. I think it's this verse. What does it say anyway? - Oh, I don't know, I just slap 'em on there. Why don't you come by a little later on and I'll fix you up with a new verse. - Yeah, yeah. - Something with sexual overtones. - Okay, okay. - What if it isn't in there? - It's in there. - Well what if you, what if, what if, screws up like last time. - He won't screw up. - Well, well, well, what if-- - What if, what if I rip out your vocal chords? Then maybe you shut up. (alarm ringing) Ah, he screwed up. - Damn! (whistle blowing) (yelling) (upbeat music) (sirens blaring) - God bless you, sir. - Oh, Martin. Doesn't the city smell great tonight? - Yeah. - Okay. Okay. Why don't you tell me about this, this girl? - Well, when we got to the door, I just felt this incredible chemistry. - I know what you were feeling, Martin, and it wasn't chemistry. - I said beginnings are great for me and she was just sort of nervous. And then I said, well-- - Martin, you're really in trouble now. - Like I just don't know if she was feeling the same high about our potential as I was, you know? - Martin, when's the last time you got laid? - I don't know whether to call her or just run into her at the club, you know what I mean? I just don't know. - How many times do I have to tell you? Women these days are real romantic. Tell her all about your family, your past, you know, stuff like that, but take at least five minutes. - Yeah, but Wally, I'm desperate. I like her. - You gotta learn to start taking chances. Put your ass on the line. Why play it safe? Summer's almost over, you know. - You know, you're right. - Yeah. - Thanks, Wally. - No problem, kid. - Come on inside. I got something for you. - Is this a surprise? - You may call it that. - Let me see. What could it be? - I'll never tell. - Could it be those signboards I asked you for? - How'd you know? (laughing) - Call it intuition. - This ought to knock them dead, Wally. - Don't wanna kill 'em, Marty, just wanna take their money. - [Martin] So what do you think? - Huh? - Oh god, I'm sorry. The Lord shall smile on thee with sexual favors when thou givest money to the blind. (laughing) It's orange and green with big red letters. Should do the trick. - All right, good. Here, look, I have something for you too. - Wow, Wally. Where did you get this? - Someone ran past me today and dropped it in my cup. - You're kidding. It's real. - You can have it. - Hey, thanks. Fits great. Maybe I'll give it to Samantha. - My fingers were too fat. Besides, I didn't have anybody to give it to anyway. Listen, see you on the streets. And remember, you never find love when you go looking for it. Love has to find you. - Yeah. Hey, thanks, Wally. And good luck with that new verse. Hey, it's a step down. - [Wally] Hey, thanks, kid. - See you later, pal. - [Wally] All right. - Why didn't you show this to me? Nicole, Nicole, answer me. - Lighten up, Samantha, Jesus. - Well, why didn't you show it to me? - I just forgot. - You just forgot. Mother writes to tell us daddy's gotten sicker and you just forgot. - Oh, I love it when you're angry. (mumbling) - Then do what it says, call home. - You know daddy is not gonna listen to me. - Nicole, you're the only one he will listen to. - Used to listen to. Look, Sam, I just can't go home right now. My career's just starting to take off. - Terrific. I didn't come up here for my health, you know. - Don't be so self righteous. You did not just come up here to get me to come home. You came up here to get out of the south, have a good time in the big city, and get yourself a man. - Not true. - [Nicole] Is so. - Is not. - All right, then swear. If you're lying, you'll get open, running sores on your face. - Nicole, I can't say that. - Well then you're lying. Admit it, you want Martin.

Where you headed at this hour? - I wanna drive around. - [Martin] Want some company? - [Samantha] No. - What's wrong? - My sister's wrong. - Yeah, well I'm not your sister. Let's talk later. - Can't, I'm spending the night at my parent's house. - Oh? - Look, it's personal. I'll tell you about it later, okay? When I'm up to it. - [Machine] Please deposit 15 more cents. Thank you. Please don't strike me. - Screw you and don't tell me what to do! - [Machine] Screw you too, asshole. - Ah, now come on out, Nicole. - [Martin] What are you doing? - We were playing a little strip hide and seek. Nicole decides to run out in the hall. - [Nicole] Yeah, well he's trying to strip me and I'm trying to hide. - Man, you white people are crazy. I'm going back to my room and play my bass. - Well you started it. - I'm coming with you. - Okay, Nicole, you forced me to use riot tactics. (spraying) - God, you've just (mumbling) for life! Sucker!

Daddy. Hi daddy. - Sam? What are you doing? What time is it? - It's really late but I wanted to see you. - Is Nicky here? - No, she's back at the motel, she's asleep. Well, we've got these friends with us from Boston so we've got these rooms, separate rooms, and she's back there asleep. - She'll be along later though, right? - Yeah, sure. - Good. - Why don't you go home, kid? - I'm waiting for her autograph. - When she comes to, the last thing she's gonna wanna see is your punk face, believe me. - But-- - Get out of here. She passed out about 10 minutes ago. - Come on, Nicole. Let's go. - How're you doing, Lenny? (giggling) (baby crying) - You seen a redneck around here? - We're the only two people in town who aren't rednecks. Does that answer your question? - Ain't you with the band? - Uh, yeah. I'm the drummer. - Oh boy! - Okay girls, don't panic. I've had emergency survival training. Step one in elevator safety is breathe deeply from the diaphragm like this. Oh, excellent. Step two is locate emergency support items. Oh, excellent choice, ladies. Excellent! So what have you girls been up to this evening? - Taking pictures. - Oh, hot diggity dog. Say, that's Wally, isn't it? - Yeah, Wally's great. - Yeah, Wally's naked too which gives me an idea. Here's how we do this. You see, we each put our three most favorite things to do sexually on little pieces of paper. Then we all throw 'em in a big hat and we draw out one a piece. - Write mine down for me. You know the ones I like. - Okay, what's your favorite? - [TV Host] Fascinating stuff here. I wanna know how a nine and a half year old girl like yourself became a millionaire. - [Girl] Well Bill, it was bribery and extortion. - [Announcer] Another broadcast day. Tune in tomorrow at 10-- - [Female] Reikian therapy can refocus your chakra. - [Male] Bob, I really don't feel good about it. Let's ask the robot.

Just wanted to remind you that here at Loony Leonard's-- - You've always wanted me. Now is your chance. - [Leonard] You just can't afford to wait. Permits? Where the hell do you think this is, Russia? Permits never stop me from selling a gun. All you gotta do is walk in, look me straight in the eyes and say Loony Leonard, I want one. Bullets, you bet. We got 'em by the box or by the pound. Stop in today and remember, here at Loony Leonard's, free souvenir 3D matches with every purchase. - [Male] The gun jumps off the pack right into your face.

Two point. - Here we go, Ms. Sadie. I'll get this elevator working for you and get you on your way to your sewing circle. - Thank you, sonny. - Uh, this elevator's taken. Uh, we'll use the stairs. It's a massage seminar. - But I like it. - Well then we'll sign you up. Yeah, downstairs. The registration's downstairs, here we go. - You know, I've known Martin for eight years and I really think you ought to give him a second chance regardless of whether anything happened or not and it probably didn't and you wanna know what else? I think you ought to give your sister a second chance too. - Yeah, but it's so typical of Nicole to try to put her mark on everything I value. It's been that way since we were kids. - You didn't get far. - Yeah, I got yanked off the damn bus. - Why'd you bring him back? We'd have more fun in Florida than we're having here. - Excuse me miss. Here you go, brother. There you go, brother. There you go, oh sorry. - Nicole. Listen. You need to help me with your sister. - Huh? - Yeah, she's really upset. She thinks something went on between us last night. Look, could you just talk to her for me? Really. Anything would help. - You've really got it bad for her, don't you? All right, I'll talk to her. (downbeat music) - What do we do now? - Why don't you lend us some of your Florida money? - Hey man, I was gonna beg my way to Florida. I'm out of money too. - What are we gonna do? - Isaac M. Tunstall presents the Annual Christian Circus. - So what? - With Cherry Suicide? - What's wrong with that idea? - We'd get stoned. - Now that sounds like a good idea. - He means we'd get run out of town. - Oh, that's no problem. I was heading out of town anyway. - You know, Wally's right. What's the worst that could happen? - It just did. - Now, now, be nice. Don't lose it, Samantha. Maybe he told her he just, uh, wants to propose to you. Morning. (laughing) - [Wally] What happened? - Sam. - Stop following her around. - Yeah man, just let her cool off a little bit. - We got a gig. - Wow, where? You're kidding. The Christian Circus? A revival? Us? You gotta be kidding. They will throw us off the stage. You're from around here, you know how they are. - [Lenny] Yeah, but I heard there's a new guy running it now. - Yeah, but it's still a religious revival. We're a rock band. - Well, I just thought it'd be a good way to make some money. Besides, I'd like to get my drums out after 12 years. - Come on, let's do it. We need the money. You can't argue with that, Nicky. We're stuck here. Besides, we could always throw in a gospel tune. - Go for it. - Okay. Let's give it a shot. - All right! We'll rehearse at my house! - [Curtis] You got room? - Hey man, I got all the room you need. - Let's do it! - [Lenny] Hey man, you look like somebody pissed in your coffee, come on. - You coming, Wally? - Nah, I'm gonna hang out here and watch the cars go by. (upbeat music) - This is gonna be really exciting. Playing a gig down south. - It'll be pearls before swine. They won't appreciate us. - Sam? Sam? - Hello Wally. - Sam. Are you okay? - Mm-hmm. - Here, here. Got a friend for you. I got a friend for you. Look, look, look, look, look. Have you seen him? Dancing (mumbling). Here. - Thanks. - What are friends for?

I got everything here from shotguns to little ladies purse packing 22's there for target tin cans and just pissed at somebody and wanna mess 'em up a little bit. Course you're going after something heavy, I got a real gun here for a real man. Careful, don't catch your finger in that like I did once. It was purple for two weeks. Now some people like these shiny guns. I like this one. I used it to repair the outhouse last week and I'll tell you, I like to take my skivvies off sometimes and tape it to my leg with a little duct tape, walk around all day-- - How about the one in the box? - This is a fine gun, this is a good gun, this is a good choice. Comes with a free box of bullets today. It's a 32 charter army cylinder gun and perfect for a man like you. It's a little expensive but I see you got plenty of money here and you aren't gonna have any trouble paying for that. I got a wallet just like that I got from a little girl. How about a pack of free matches? Come on back. You need any targets here, I'm open 24 hours a day. This is a fine gun. (laughing) - These are amazing, man, amazing. This is pretty kinky, Wally. - No, it's not kinky. It's just your average naked teenage girl photo session. - Here they come. - Oh, give me those, give me those. - Morning folks. - Morning. - Claudia, Terry, this is Curtis. - Are you in the band? - Yeah, I play bass. - Wow, we should've met you last night. - You were probably too busy. - Yeah, too busy. - [Lenny] Oh god. - What's happening with you? - I got a hold of some bad slaw last night. I threw up twice in the same place. - Ew! - Can we change the subject? - Yeah, to food. - I'd like a cup of cold, greasy gravy please. - You want the usual, right, Lenny? - [Lenny] Yep. - How you want them eggs? - I want 'em out of a shell but I don't want 'em raw, now. - How about like your brain, fried? (laughing) - You want something to eat? - Oh no, Claudia hasn't had solid food for three weeks. - You have a cold, reverend? - Allergies. - Oh. - I certainly have enjoyed this visit but-- - Oh, yes. - Sorry. - That's a lot more than we usually give. - Well I'm sure the television ministry can put this to good use. - So what are we buying groceries with this week? - A pledge is a pledge, honey. - This has been just divine. - Reverend Tunstall. You know how badly we need that money. Can't you let us off this week? - Well like your husband says, a pledge is a pledge. (upbeat music) - [Female] Taxi! Hey, freaking weirdo! - Hey, you got asthma, right? My wife's got asthma, I'd know it anywhere. - Who cares, I don't give a shit. - Yeah, asthma's a funny thing. Did you know it was an emotional disorder? Hey, you ain't got an emotional disorder, have you? Boy, my wife sure has an emotional disorder. Damn. Every time she starts wheezing, it just makes my skin crawl. - Just shut up and drive. - What brings you to town? - Revenge. - Terrific, you'll love the town. - How much was that? - 21 dollars plus tip. What's wrong? - We're broke. - Come on, Claudia. Let's get out of here. We're leaving. - How come? - [Terry] They're a bunch of deadbeats. - [Claudia] But we've fooled around with worse. - Girls, girls, we don't need money to have fun. - After breakfast, we have 200 dollars. - Well hell, man, that's plenty. We're fed. - We're okay. - We haven't paid for the hotel rooms yet. - We're screwed. - Damn it, man, what are we gonna do? - Well, it's been nice knowing you. I guess I'll go on home. (laughing) - Hey, listen to this, Earl. 279 ways to kill with a pencil. Number one, shove the pencil under the soft underbelly of the victim's throat. (spraying) Yes. May we help you? - I'd like a room please. - Fine. (phone ringing) Fine. (yelling) - Boo! - Hello. Hey Samantha, wait! Samantha please, let me explain! Really, nothing happened. You're jumping to conclusions. - Oh bullshit, Martin. I walk in and the two of you were getting out of bed. - You're making it something it wasn't. - I'm not making it anything. You're the one that's been hot after her. - Give me a break, you don't even know me yet. - You're assuming I still want to. - Look Samantha, I'm trying to start a meaningful relationship with you. - Well let me give you a hint. Sleeping with my sister is a lousy way to go about it. - Slap him, honey. - What are you talking about? I left my home to come with you on this crazy little trip. I'm standing in the middle of a parking lot in a town I've never even heard of deep in the south. - In your underwear! - In my underwear. Having an argument with the woman that I just may be falling in love with. - Really, Martin? Really? - Well. Maybe. Anyway, I had to say something to get you to stop and listen to me. - Jesus, Martin, what a lousy trick. - I know but I do love you. I think. - Martin, has anyone ever told you that you're wishy washy? - Well you're not so decisive yourself, you know. - I am so. Give me an example. - Okay, okay. Like we sleep together both nights on this wonderful little journey to Oz. Then we hit your hometown and you split. - So what you're saying is you think that you and I should sleep together every night. Is that right? - Well is there anything wrong with that? - Well, then, when would you have time to sleep with my sister? - I don't wanna screw your sister! - I'll screw her sister! - I'll screw her! (horn honking) (mumbling) - I've got this note here that your blind friend left for you. Great birthday party, huh? - Yeah. (mumbling) (gentle music) - Hey miss, you forgot to pay! - Wally, where do you think you're going? - [Wally] Florida. - Florida? You can't go, Wally. Stick around, we'll miss you. - Nah, listen. I've always wanted to do this. I've just never been this close before. - Well, did you say goodbye to Martin? - I left him a note. - Left him a note? Wally, how is that gonna make him feel? - Look, going to say goodbye, he'd only try to make me stay. - Getting on the bus, buddy? - [Wally] Yes. - No. Wally, please. (baby crying) - [Wally] Will you leave me alone? - Look, would you two fight this out some place else? I've got a schedule to keep. - I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Wally. Sorry. - Come on, Nicky, we're gonna be late. - [Nicole] Okay, okay. (upbeat music) - [Ivan] Follow that van! (screeching) (crunching) (horn honking) - What the hell is going on? - Go! (horn honking) (crashing) Ram him. - What? - You heard me, ram the asshole. - Are you crazy? - Well then I'll blow your kneecap off! (crunching) - What's this guy trying to do? - Speed up. - Damn, man, what are you trying to do? (shouting) (crashing) - What the hell is going on? Who is that? - Who knows? Anyway, I think we lost him. - Holy shit. Holy shit! Holy shit. - Hey, where are the keys? - [Announcer] Welcome, welcome, welcome to Isaac M. Tunstall's Annual Christian Circus. (mumbling) - God needs your money. How about a t-shirt today? - [Announcer] On the midway, spending money on unique love gifts and religious novelty items. - [Male] You are afraid to face your family. You have unspoken frailties and infirmaries. You have cancer. You are possessed with wild hallucinations. You have a tumor growing within you. - Hey. Nice. - What took you so long? - Some psychopath in a taxi cab. - You have rheumatoid halitosis of the spine. But that's all right. All this shall pass away. You're gonna feel all right. You're gonna feel real good. The power's coming, the power's coming. Heal, I said heal! I said heal! Hallelujah! Arise and walk! Go on, get up! - Thank you, Jesus! (clapping) Thank you, Jesus, thank you, Jesus! (gun firing) (engine rumbling) - Hello. - Hello. (upbeat music) (chattering) - How about a t-shirt, four dollars and 99 cents? - Weirdo. (screaming) - Can't we just forget all this nonsense? What do you say? - Martin, I-- - What? - [Samantha] Look, look over there. - [Martin] What, I don't see anything. Just a crowd of people. - It's Ivan, I swear, Ivan's here! - Nah. - Come on, I'll prove it. - Just a second. No more fighting, okay? - Okay. No more. - [Announcer] To tell you about our new television ministry. We now have our own satellite beaming the word of salvation across the entire US of A. Oh lordy, that makes me happy. Now mister (mumbling), how about some Christian juggling while the band sets up? - Friends and neighbors, I'm here to juggle for Jesus and I want you sinners to know that hell is hot and you sinners will burn in eternal damnation if you don't turn your back on your sinning evil ways and live righteously according to Jesus's word. If you do that, on judgment day, you'll be sitting next to the father, the son, and the holy spirit. (clapping) And have eternal life. (clapping) Thank you, Jesus, thank you, thank you. (clapping) - What's the matter with his makeup? He looks slick. No, no. Cut back to a wider shot. He don't like us to be that close on him. - [Male] Standby, camera one. - Has made it big nationally and this next little lady's on her way to doing just that so let's give a big welcome to Cherry Suicide. - Suicide?

Before we move on. I want several of you to make a love offering, a love gift to the Christian Circus. - He's a hypocrite, a phony! - A gift that will allow me to continue-- - He's a conman! - To other needy areas of the world. (whistling) - All your money just go to him! Let me go! Let me go! - Bring me the gift of love. - Oh my gosh! (screaming) (gun firing) (dramatic music) - Boss, are you okay? - You set me up! - Easy, easy, no. (mumbling) Take it easy, put that away. - [Male] Give me the knife. - No way, pal! You're not getting near me! You're all in on it! (splattering) - [Reporter] Seconds ago, violence erupted in this small sleepy southern mill town at the Annual Christian Circus, leaving its promoter, Isaac Tunstall, wounded. Now it is not quite certain what caused the disturbance but what I've been able to piece together since I arrived on the scene just 30 seconds ago, a strange looking man wearing a black leather jacket and sporting red streaked hair that stood up in spikes has allegedly shot and wounded Isaac Tunstall. Now it is also rumored that this was a KGB mastermind plot but this, as of yet, has not been confirmed. - I-V-A-N. - This is Doreen Bates London reporting. - You know, I think Cherry Suicide with Lenny Drake would look nice in purple glitter letters right across the side there. What do you think? Come on, lighten up, Curtis. It was just a joke, my man. (laughing) Well, that's it, let's hit it. - Okay. - Don't stay away so long next time. - I won't. (gentle music) I promise. - Here. I'll send you some postcards from Florida. - The weather is beautiful. This is Disney World today. Mickey says hi.
