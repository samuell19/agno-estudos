I am going to call him Matheus I don't know anyone with this name so I guess I won't have problems Where do I start? I remember I met him on an app for casual sex But I think that in the movie wouldn't look very good I think it's much nicer to say that we met... At a club? No, no, no. I don't care much for clubs, he neither I guess a track for model airplanes is better? He loves these things I remember him saying he wanted to build a little model airplane... with remote control Yeah... I think that sounds good. Is yours the red one? Yeah, it is. Very cool! Which one is yours? No, I don't have one I just come here to look. Ah! Hi! Hi! Well! It really doesn't matter how we met I think the movie can skip that part In fact I won't be able to write about how we met and how we got closer to each other Because I don't remember the time when we weren't close All I remember is us being two guys that always knew each other since they were born Is this camera able to capture these tiny little dots? Sometimes... It depends on the photographer And the imagination of who sees the picture as well Do you always take this kind of photos? Occasionally Look! Do you want to take one? Oh no I am not good at these things... Come here! Take one! Here, this is the diaphragm. You let it open and close it Depending on how much light you want to get to the lenses. Seeing that you want to capture stars You want more light to get to the lenses. Ok. Which star are you going to capture? I am going to take a picture of that one. Go ahead. Wow, it got blurry It's good. Good? You don't have to be kind. I am not being kind. It's art. Abstract. I am going to take another one. Look, this one is better. Yes, this one is. And what do I get? This is the best photo. Which one? The one we can't take. I didn't understand. Our kiss. We were so involved That if we stopped to take a picture It would be a mistake The best photo Is the one we can't take The one that stays here and here. I am not a star. I'll close the diaphragm more. Give me a big smile. Hm, I think the architect is going to become a photographer Would you be too crushed if I won a photography prize before you? I think that for this to happen it would have to be a picture of my corpse. Photography isn't even my dream. Oh, no? No! I chose photography because it's close to cinema. I want to be a movie director. Wow I Movie director. I want to be an actor in your film. Let's see if you have the talent to be an actor. Cry. Oh my God, no. I want to see tears. Do you want me to teach you how to cw? I do! (M.! Then yawn. Yawn with your mouth closed Don't let anyone see that you are yawning. Disguise it. Without using your hand. Don't blink. Feel the wind hitting you in the eye. Now make a sad face So no one notices you are yawning. It's almost there. Here, look it's a little wet. Make a sad face Yeah, make a sad face poor guy. Don't let anyone notice Don't blink Sad face That's it Poor guy You're tearing up Oh! You're already the best actor in the world. This is going to be very useful. Oh yeah? Be careful with how you use it. He was essentially a mathematician. I, an artist. But I saw him as an artist as well. He had plans to transform the entire world into one big garden. And that's all every artist wants. To beautify the world. He came with me sometimes to see how tough the life of a photographer is. Let's go. Look at your fiance', with endearment and let's go! But is this picture going to look like the Scarlett Johansson one? Like Scarlett Johansson? Yes, I sent you a picture. Don't you remember? Yes! I do. - I am using that picture as a reference. - No! - It's an inspiration. - No! I want my picture exactly like the Scarlett Johansson one. Yes! (M.! All right! Then listen to me. Scarlett Johansson was very relaxed in those pictures. You are a bit tense. So stay calm and loosen up, ok? Relax. Look at your fiance' Relaxed Let' s gm! Like this? No! No! Forget that you are having your picture taken Pretend the camera isn't here. Ok? Look at your fiance'. With a lot of endearment, a lot of love Think about your story... No, this side of me is horrible, let's switch. No! No! Hey! Switch back. We'll take from both sides, ok? That side was good. The light was right for that angle. We'll switch later. We'll do it both ways and pick later. For fuck's sake. You are looking just like Scarlett Johansson. Scarlett Johansson. Fuck. This is one of my passions. Why? I don't know. I think it's pretty. I feel powerful. Hm, so silly. It's strong, right? Just looking at it makes your eyes hurt. I could blind you if I wanted to. Wow I How nice you are. Do you want to know which is your dominant eye? Get out. Come on! Eye exam now. - Let me see. - No! Are you crazy? - I am going to dilate your pupil - No! What is that? Stop, give it to me. My turn. Does it affect the functionality? I don't know. Hum, I am going to take it away Because I need it working. - Do you trust me? - No. - I don't trust you. - You do. - I don't. - Yes. You do! Now I come with the water, right? - It's enough, Diego. - A little bit on the leaves also. No, it's enough. - You are going to drown it. - Ok, now on this one... A little bit on the soil. Diego, you are going to drown them. You going to drown them. It's enough already, ok? - Ok. They look good. - Yes, these are my babies. I can see that. - You like them a lot, don't you? - Yep! I majored in architecture to become a gardener. When I was little I wanted to be a gardener. I planted a little bean in cotton and when it began to grow I thought I had a great gift. Yeah, promising... This one right here is called Vitor. - It really looks like a Vitor. - You are crazy. - They don't have a name? - No. But I agree, it really looks like a Vitor. And it's dating Alice. It so looks like an Alice. Yes, it does look like an Alice. Alice! Didn't you say you had difficulty finding friends around here So, now you have a bunch of little friends. Victor, Alice - Joana and Maristela. - Maristela? - Yeah. - I got it. He was kind of quiet, introvert Sometimes it was hard to know what was going on in his head. I wanted to be able to make him open up more, Make him less introspective. Less shy. Although his shyness drove me crazy. Sometimes I couldn't hold myself. I had to grab him no matter where. I got horny by his side all the time. And I made sure to show him that. It could be in the middle of the street, He got totally embarrassed. I loved to see him like that. Look that guy over there He doesn't know where the little green light is coming from. That's bad. Oh, I'll put... Look, I am going to put it on his stomach. Poor guy. Don't do that. You do that with your neighbors often, right? No, you are the one who is a bad influence on me. Hm, me, you probably do that all day. What, I have better things to do. You think? - What is it asshole? - Wow! What the fuck is this? Woops damn, I think he saw us. Go fuck yourself, you son of a bitch. Shove this damn thing up your mother's ass! - Up the asshole! - Wow! You joker! Hey! Hi! - Stop filming me. - No. Diego, stop it! Stay cool, you'll get used to it. No! Don't do that. - Don't do anything. - What is that for? I had an idea for a movie, I am directing you. Oh my, I am not a good actor. Go. Look over there. Keep walking. Find something strange in the woods, go. No, really find something strange, don't pretend. Ok. Go, find it weird. - No! - Ah, enough, enough. Ok. So look at the camera. Look over here and send me a message. Diego You lunatic, stop filming me. - Diego, you lunatic, stop filming me. - You're a killjoy. Stop filming me, Diego. What? I am tired of photographing pregnant women, brides. It's always the same old mechanical pictures. I rather photograph more spontaneous moments Like when I was filming you. You were being yourself, granted, a bit bizarre. - Bizarre you say? - A little bit. I don't know what you are talking about, my mom thinks I am handsome. I had an idea for a short film. A guy is lost in forest like this one. He is looking for a way out. - He can't find it and... - And? You finish! And... He finds another guy who is also lost - and they end up... - Having sex! Oh! Is this going to be rated R? - Let's do it now! - You're tripping. Yeah! Come on, love! - What did you call me? - Love. How cute! Close your eyes! I am going to make you a surprise! Love! Oh, fuck Diego! Why do you think people kill themselves? Because life loses it's meaning for them? My brother's birthday is coming up. What about your brother? He... killed himself when he was 14 years old. That destroyed my family. My mother got depressed, my father started drinking... Shortly after they got a divorce And to this day I don't think I am very right in the head. Why did he kill himself? We don't know. He didn't leave anything. Our family has a history of depression. So we thought he was depressed. But we don't know why. He never asked for help. Sometimes I keep thinking I could have done something. No, don't think like that. Have you already lost someone? Yeah. A little dog. But it's like I lost a person. Really. It hurts a lot, right? Very much. But don't keep blaming yourself for your brother's death. How long ago was this? Twelve years ago. Ok! Twelve years. That is a very long time. Your brother is already in another dimension. Living other perspectives. This world here doesn't make sense for him anymore But you are alive. What is his name? - Marcelo. - Marcelo. (M.! Come with me, now! Ever since I met him I saw a sadness behind his eyes Now I knew why. He was never much for talking and I preferred not to invade his world. But I was set into putting an end to his sadness. Even if he didn't notice it. That day I found out how much I loved him because no one wanted more than me to take away the sadness in his eyes. I remember telling him Dream big. Make a dream. A person without dreams is not happy. And looks like he listened to me. Oh, stop that! Careful with the plate. - Oh my dear God! - No! No! No! Let's clean you up. - Let me finish here... - Ai... Look what you are doing. - No, no, no! - Ok, ok... Peace! You are very vindictive. Diego you are very vindictive, stop that. Oh my dear God. What are you trying to do? That's disgusting! Like this? I think here on the left it's a bit lower. Don't you think? How about now? We had a world for ourselves. The coolest part of it all was to see that even after we were married we kept those butterflies in our stomachs. Our playful spirit. We looked like an eternal couple of teenagers. Sometimes we had disagreements, of course. - Matheus! - What... what is so hard about picking your clothes off the floor? Come on, it's all just laying on the floor, a big mess. It makes me sad. Ok. I'll do it soon. Come on, go, you keep laying around watching TV, you never do anything. - I do it all by myself. - Oh my love, come here. Give me a kiss, my dods. What? Unfit you know what duds means'? Maid! Yeah, that's right, smart boy. Everything is clean here. Nothing dirty, you just have to put away. This one is a bit dirty. Diego, where is the fertilizer I left on the counter? What fertilizer? I just saw some garbage, I threw it all away. Fuck, are you serious? I just bought some fertilizer and you threw it away? Well, you are paying the price for being disorganized. You leave it all there, it looks like garbage. We think we have to throw away. You are paying the price for being disorganized... Look, I love you. But sometimes you are a pain in the ass! No! No! No! Get out! N“.! What? Oh my dear God. - What are you trying to do? - Help me! You can help yourself! No! Oh my God! - Ai! - Sorry! Enough! That's enough! Right? What! What is it? What are you doing? What the fuck is that? Get out! Save me! - No! You can! - Save me! Save me! Please! I can't! Mateus! My shirt! Oh, how annoying you are! You're all sweaty! Disgusting! Let's watch TV! Enough! Bye! So, what's on today's schedule? We are going to watch a movie together under the blanket. Let me pick the movie. One day we'll be watching my movie. Oh, I am sure of that. Especially after you study in California. Han? I saw the poster. So you are going to study abroad for four years. Is that it? I just took the poster, because I found it interesting. Ok. Hey, what are you thinking? That I am going to leave you? No, I didn't say anything. I wasn't thinking anything. I was just curious to understand why you didn't tell me. Love! Oh my God, I know you. - Stop that. - I am not doing anything. Oh my God, I hate this. Relax! I just wanted to understand why you have to go study so far away. Can't you go to film school around here? Yes, yes, of course, I can. Obviously. I am going to look around here. Claro! I even saw that the public university is going to open a film course. It would be good for me to graduate. Yeah, that's a great idea. Look, when I took that poster It was very arbitrary, it didn't mean anything. Ok? Where are you going? There is a client waiting at the studio. To take pictures. What a shame, I was going to call you to take a walk together. Oh my God, we'll take a walk tomorrow, ok? Good morning. Well, I am going then. Ok, have a nice day at work. I love you. I love you too. - Bye! - Bye. Am I looking good? You look great. Is she going to like me? Of course she is, my mother likes anything. Wow, thanks for the "anything". You look great, my darling. She's here! So mom, how was the trip? Oh, it was great, wonderful my son. So, this is the prince. That's right, mom, this is Matheus. He is handsome. Oh, you have good taste, my son. - Thank you, Mrs Marcia. - Marta! - Marta? - Marta. Thank you, Mrs Marta. The house is humble, but I hope you make yourself at home. Oh, come on, you can relax. I love homosexuals. Mother! I even told Diego, That you can stay here for a few days if you want. Oh, he told me, but I didn't want to bother you guys. I know how a young couple is. Very loud! Mom! I know, my son, I was young once too. Mom, cut it out! Oh son, cut the false moralism, ok? You want to know what? I already hooked up with a few girls around... You did? Yeah, I did, isn't that how you guys say it? Hook up? Yes, that's right. I didn't know that. I am modern. Look, I don't stress out. You guys are a beautiful couple, young. I am a beautiful lady, young. I came to the city to have fun. Your father stayed, right? Taking care of the shop. I didn't know your father had a mechanical workshop. Yes, he does. His father is the stereotypical macho man! Oh, I see. Oh, but he doesn't fool me. What, mom? Oh, my son, I know a lot of people have taboos when it comes to sexuality But I don't. For me the brain is full of dirty thoughts. With something, with someone. Oh, the human being is very creative, very inventive. - Mom! - No one can tell me.. That his father... Didn't feel a little finger down there at least once. " MY God! _ Mom! - Mom! - What my son? - Mom! - Be cool. Do you know what matters in this life? The only thing that matters in this life? To be happy. I wish you two all the happiness in the world. Look, you take good care of my son, ok? And you! Do not miss this prince! He was a good husband. Even lent me money when I needed it. I rented a studio to take some pictures for a few clients and ended up getting into debt. The good part about owing money to your love is that you can always pay in a different way. - What's that? Put the seat belt. - Hold on. - No! - Hold on, hold on. What are you going to do, Matheus? - Hold on Diego, just a little. - No, sit down. - I have to do this with the window. - No, sit down. - It's quick. - No, no, I am not going to let you do this. - Matheus, don't! - Wow! How violent! - Are you insane? - Wait! - Look what you did, put the seat belt. - My God! - You are drunk. - You are very stressed out. Give me this. It's dangerous. - Put the seat belt. - Wait! I am going to, I am going to! - Then do it! - I am going to! - Matheus, don't. - I am going to. - It's dangerous. - It's so good, just a minute. Give me here. - You're crazy, no. - It's quick. No, no Matheus, don't. - There is no danger. - Sit down. - I am going to stop the car here. - No! - Yes I am. - No. No, no, no! - I am going to stay here. - Oh, come on. - You are drunk. - Speed up! I am not going anywhere until you put your seat belt on. Aren't you going to put it? What can I do For you to let me do it just for a little bit? Nothing. It's dangerous, you are drunk. If you fall you are going to die. Do you want to die? What if... You let me do it... And then you don't have to pay the money you owe me. - Just for a little bit? - Yeah! - Then I won't have to pay the money? - Uh huh! - Ok, then just for a little bit. - Oh so now it's ok, you son of a bitch? - Now there is no problem! - Just for a minute. - Now it's not dangerous, right? - Just a minute! - Go. I'll hold you. - Ok. I am sorry! I did not want to lie to you. I enrolled here because I thought that I could be close to you forever, always! No, it's okay. You have enrolled I'm happy, really! I just do not understand why You had to lie. We never hid anything from each other - I know, I'm sorry! - Are not we married? Those people you should not hide anything from? - Great. - I'm sorry. - Please! - Ok. And as for travel, we can even buy. But... If I pass the test I'll have to stay here a few days to complete the registration process. Hmm! I got it! And it is possible that I can pass Because the competition is too easy OK! Let's wait then! - But do not be like this! - No. It's ok. - I love you! - I love you too. Hey! Hi. You are the most beautiful thing I've ever seen. Keep taking care of your plants Let me just look at you. Love! Love! Hey love. Let's sleep in the bed, come on? Let's go, I'll take you, come with me. What about that guy in the front row? For God's sake, he is very unnecessary. He asks questions when it's five minutes to the end of the class. - The one with the funny haircut? - That's the one. - That's true. - I really don't have the patience. Feel comfortable here, ok? As I said, it's a simple home. But it's enough to get by. No, but we could do something with it. I don't know, we could make a comedy short film, with those guys. A short film about our classmates! - That's a good idea, huh? - Fuck, that would be perfect. - Like, what could we do? - We could make a trash film. Something a bit like, Pink Flamingos. Wow, Pink Flamingos, that's a great movie! - A chicken on the classroom... - Very conceptual, it's all conceptual. Oh, you are here. My love! I didn't see you. This is Vitor. - How are you Vitor? Nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you too. Vitor, Matheus, my husband. Vitor is from my classes. I met him there. Oh, cool. - You're welcome, feel at home. - Thank you. We think so much alike, right? We already had tons of ideas. - First short film, right? - We are going to do a short film together! We are very excited, we are pumped. He has a camera, we are going to take it. Just do it. Very good, right? That one from the little castle... Cinema was my dream ever since I was a child. I hadn't been able to get into a public university. But I passed the exam for the film school in California. A four-year course. I had hidden from Matheus the fact that I did the test. I had done it just to see if I was able to pass. But after the result it became an obsession. I feel sad because you hid it from me I feel sad I do not recognize the Diego I met. Don't say that! It could work! They will pay for my food, my hosting we can include you. I'm not going with you. What? I'm not going- Why can not you dream with me? You stopped dreaming with me, Diego! It's my only chance. Millions of people wanted to be in my place. I know that! And I'm happy for you! Let's go with me! Do not ask me that! I love you! I love you forever! Forever even when I am old and wrinkled? Not then. You ass. Forever, until you are like this. No! Stop. Stop it! ~ Hi! ~ Hi! - No, no, no. - Yes, yes, yes. - That hurts. - Stop being a coward. It's strong, right? Just looking at it hurts my eyes. I could make you blind if I wanted to. Wow! What a nice person you are. Diego, you lunatic, stop filming me. I had promised him that we would keep in touch. That whenever it was possible I would come back to visit him. But during those four years, that didn't happen. Before I left I had asked him we would go in one of the first places we went together. A very special place for me So we could say goodbye. I don't know why life does these things. Why does it bend. All of the sudden everything is lost everything transforms into something else without you being able to notice it. Seems like life has a life of it's own we are just puppets. Wow, are we really here? Yes, we are, handsome. We are going to stay here until the sun sets. Let's stay here as long as you want to. That would make a good picture. Or a good scene in a movie. My dear Matheus. You know we weren't as perfect as I described. You weren't as perfect as I described. Neither was I. But that doesn't matter. What matters is that good part. The best of us. That's what sticks. Thanks for making me happy. I believe that life while we are living. The moment, the now, it's its best version. It stays even more beautiful when it's a memory. I learned from you, from our story that we have to make each moment from today the most spectacular memory for tomorrow. This movie is an eternal record of my memories and they are spectacular. You can find the love of your life at any moment in this world. Sometimes you are going to find them at the wrong moment at the wrong time. But I believe a great love isn't limited to this life. It goes beyond. I am certain I know him from other lives.
