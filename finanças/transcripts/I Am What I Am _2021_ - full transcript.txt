When a lion stomps its feet, the earth and the heavens shake. We pray for the blessing of all lives to thrive! Raise the lion! The lion dance is a splendid Chinese tradition that combines dance, music and martial arts into one performance. Since ancient times, the lion dance has been popular and passed down from generation to generation. At all grand events, a lion dance is essential for a fun atmosphere. For those who are far away from home, the sight of a dancing lion raising its head to thundering drums immediately reminds them of home, giving them hope for tomorrow despite today's hardships. There are two lion dance styles, the North and the South. Southern lion dances are expressive. By jumping, moving, dodging, pouncing, spinning, and leaping, the performers present the lion as fierce, mighty, and lively. "Picking the Lettuce" is a Southern lion dance performance. The two lions compete for a head of lettuce that connotes wealth building. The one who dances with the best footwork and body movements wins the contest. There have been many lion dance masters over the past millennia and the legend of Master Wong Fei-hung is known to every household. But this story isn't about him. It is a story about... Daoshan dude yo Why are you wearing your worn-out flip-flops? Daoshan dude yo Gyun. Have your parents come back yet? Why are you still riding that old bike? Gyun, where are you going? To watch the lion dance show. You're so full of yourself Dark clouds shroud the sky It's going to rain My mom is waiting for me to have supper I'm to blame for back then I was a good-for-nothing, and always messed around I'm to blame for back then You're so cocky Celebrate the Spring Festival! Hi, take a look. Hi, take a look. Mister, have a look. What is this? Welcome to the Spring Festival Lion Dance Competition of the year. Look at the lively lion dance teams. They look so cool! An inspiration to the soul. And a salute to our lives! What are you doing? What's wrong with you? Quit trying to squeeze through! Let him be. He's gone through a lot. His parents are working in Guangzhou, they've been away from home for years. No one's taught him any manners. Wow! This is so cool! Woo! This is amazing! Don't get in my way. Chad. You've got a melon head already. You don't need to wear another! I'm just having fun. Happy New Year. Happy? This is a team of lions. Yet you, a puny cat, dare to get in our way. Such a jinx. How are we supposed to have a happy new year? Did you get a red pocket? My grandpa gave me one. Give it to me to counter the bad luck. What a loser. Thanks for the red pocket. I can't believe it. Someone dared to challenge Chen's Village to a "Lettuce Picking" battle! - Bring me the head. - Roger that. Go, Red Lion! I thought you were gone. Go, Black Lion! Yeah! That's amazing! Who the hell are you? Stop her! Over here. Get on. Stop. - Go that way to outflank them. - Outta my way! - They're making a turn. - That way! Watch out! Well, we're running away from people, aren't we? Then why did you take me to the hilltop where they can easily spot us by looking up? What now? Let's keep running. That's fine. We shook them off a while ago. What's your name? Me? My name is Gyun. Mine too. How do you spell that? G-Y-U-N. Often used in girl names. No kidding. Mine too. What's up with you? Why do you have a girl's name? I got ill easily when I was young. My parents worried about me. They believed that a girl's name would bring me good luck. I guess now that we're "friends in need," you can keep it. Really? But I can't do the lion dance. Stand up. Put it on. Close your eyes. Do you hear a roar in your heart? What roar? It's roaring at you, "Don't be a puny cat that always gets bullied." "Be a fierce lion." Sixth Lion Dance Games. Promotional Ambassador. Champion. Do you... Do you really think I can do it? Definitely. Cotton tree flowers are known as Hero Flowers. You're the man chosen by a Hero Flower. Hero Flowers. Here, have some more. You too, Grandpa. Make a call to your parents later. Gyun. How is it going? Is everything okay back home? Yep, don't worry. How are you and Mom? We're fine, too. Don't worry. We have everything here in Guangzhou. It's New Year's Eve. We have extra dishes for our working dinner. We're going to have a big feast! Gyun. Have a happy new year with your grandpa. Eat well. Next year, we promise we'll come home, okay? We'll watch the lion dance together. Dad, Mom, I'm not a child anymore. I'm 18 now. You know what that means? Many of my classmates have already started working outside. You can come back and rest at home next year. I'll be the breadwinner. Nonsense. What can you do, you scrawny little dude? Focus on your schoolwork. We'll take on more work since it's the busy season and save money for your college tuition. Yes. This way I can see them all. This year, my wish didn't come true, either. It's fine. I don't blame you. If Mom and Dad can't make it, I'll make another wish. I'm going to Guangzhou to surprise them. Lion Dance Games, I'm coming. Kat... I want to be a lion dancer. Have you hit your head? Lion dancer? I'm serious. There's a competition, but I can't do it by myself. Don't count me in. Besides, the lion head mask isn't something we can afford. Wow, where did you steal it from? Let's sell it. It's not stolen. Alright, weirdo. What a buzzkill. A girl gave it to me. A girl? Was she pretty? Very pretty. Come, come. Have a seat. Tell me all the details. Here's the thing. Yesterday at the square, I met the guys from Chen's Village again... No, no, no. Tell me in detail how pretty the girl was. That's her. She's alright. Then why is your nose bleeding? I ate too many bananas. So if we join the competition, we can meet girls like her, right? Yes. Are you coming or not? Of course I am. I've always dreamed of becoming a lion dancer. Since when? Just now. We still need a drummer. Follow me. Hand-beaten Beef Balls. Pure Beef. As pure as first love. Doggie. We're going to form a lion dance team. Leave me alone. There's a position saved for you. We want you to be our drummer. My parents' work in the city can barely support me. I need to feed myself. Doggie. Have you finished yet? Almost, Boss. Just go. Don't waste my time at work. Where are the beef balls? You said lunch is included, didn't you? Is lunch provided during the competition? Yes. Bed and board included! Well... Where's the drum? Attention, please, my dear friends. A chance for fame has arisen. Our lion dance team is going to the competition. A top team like us is bound to win, but we still need a drum. If you kindly sponsor us with a drum, we will sew your shop name on our costumes. So your shop will be advertised on TV for free. It's a real bargain, anyone interested? Gyun, you pathetic thing. Like it's not enough to be a loser alone. You actually joined a team of stray cats and dogs. Do you really think you three good-for-nothings can do lion dancing? Hey, notice something fishy? The egg went bad. I mean, how do they know that our names are Kat and Doggie? What's that supposed to mean? They came prepared. Hey, don't start a fight. Don't worry, old man. Just go back. He's coming. What should we do? Overpower him with your aura. You can't have it. This lion head looks so familiar. I remember. I'm not sure who it was, but what happened at the Lettuce Picking contest and the humiliation it brought to me... Was it you? How could it possibly be me? Look at me. Look closer. I'm just a loser, alright? That does make sense. Then it was you. Bro. I know I'm a big guy, but I'm still feeling dizzy from the egg attack. How would I ever have the guts to mess with you? I guess I have no choice but to take it out on this lion head! You can always buy a new one. Nothing to cry about. Oh, I almost forgot, your poor parents have worked in the city for years but never returned. They must be too ashamed to come home because they haven't earned enough. Gyun. Beat him! Let's go home. To be honest, I envy them so much. Yeah. Their team looks invincible. Their drum is so big. It looks so cool when they drum. The sun rises with a weak red light, soon it will shine over all of the land. The Yellow River springs from underground, eventually it surges with immense force. The dragon soars up from the abyss... Melon head. Like a puny cat. You pervert! You're so stupid. Fatso. I can hear a roar in my heart. It says, "Don't be a puny cat that always gets bullied." What cat? Actually we could try again. But we've got nothing. Forget it. Yeah. Forget it. Then why are you crying? Come on. We got beaten up just now. Yep. We're no match for them. Why are you crying? Because I wanna be like them. I wanna be a fierce lion! Ahhh. Shut up! I have to go to work tomorrow! Is it normal that we have to wait so long to be their apprentices? Poet Li Bai once said, "Your sincerest determination can cut open metal and stone." Have some faith. Li Bai didn't say that, did he? What do you want? Want to learn the lion dance? Yes. Let's... let's go. I think there's a guy... Please, sir. Keep going. Here's a map. Go find him. The man lives in seclusion and is untraceable, but his legend is still being told. He used to be the pride of all. People called him the reincarnation of Wong Fei-hung. Is this really the right way? How about... Ahhh. This map is definitely correct. Despite all the dangers and difficulties, you must blaze your way through. Pass the trials if you want to be his apprentice. There's a river. Okay. Then we wade across it. It's pretty normal to jump through some hoops when you're looking for a mentors hip. We've had enough. This time, please, you must come with us. This time you won't have any problem. We don't trust you. He's over there. Are you kidding me, sir? This place is only 20-minute walk from my house. You should have told us. Why have us travel all the way out in the wild? It wasn't until I came with you that I slowly realized this isn't Shandong, but Guangdong. How did I get here? How should I go back? There's no way a lion dance master lives here. Are you sure he's here? Hey. Can you draw us one last map? It can't be him, can it? Who wrote this terrible story? Am I still dreaming? Hello? Want some salted fish? If he can perform a lion dance, we can play heroes in a film. Even the salted fish got turned around by his steps. Does that mean we can finally turn our lives around, too? Qiang, have you lost your mind! Our customers are waiting for your fish delivery, remember? You're not Wong Fei-hung! And quit trying to do the lion dance! Pack up! What are you looking at? Hurry! They've rushed us several times. Wear the helmet. Don't make me worry about you. The country is rich when its teenagers are rich. The country is strong when its teenagers are strong. The country is independent when its teenagers are independent. Follow him. The country enjoys liberty when its teenagers enjoy liberty. The country makes progress... Where should we deliver these to? We'd love to help. What's next? We'd love to help. What do you want? There's a competition. We want you to teach us lion dancing. Lion dance. Qiang! Why don't you deliver at midnight? I won't need fish by then anyway. A dead fish like you wants to perform a lion dance? Sea lion dance, maybe. You're just too old to talk about pursuing dreams. Go home and look at yourself in a mirror. Selling fish fits you! You might as well just settle with it for the rest of your life! You all heard him. I'm just a fish seller. And you don't seem to have the talent for lion dancing anyway. So get out of my hair. I've got bills to pay. It's hot today. Buy some popsicles for yourselves. Thank you. What should we do now? Buy... buy popsicles. Yes. Fool around all day long. Amazing, aren't they? Yeah... yeah... Here. Use the helmet and let me see where you're at. Look over here, guys. These guys are joining the Lion Dance Games, too. Take a look at them. What the heck are they doing? Now you know where you're at, right? What level are we at? You can break a scale. What do you think? What about me? You... You look like a monkey. You should do monkey tricks instead of lion dance, huh? What about me? If I hadn't seen those innocent eyes of yours, I'd have thought you just got out of prison. You look malnourished, like a puny cat. Did this fatso take all your food? What does that have to do with me? I know you don't see much of us. Duh. Us three are just losers to you. Nothing but a puny cat, scrawny monkey, and fat pig. Am I right? But the famous poet Li Bai once said, "All things in their being are good for something." He also said... "I laugh as I depart to my journey," "how can I be a commoner with such talent?" Li Bai... Li Bai also said... "When it's time to hoist the sails to cross the sea, ride the wind and cleave the waves." Alright, alright. I can tell you're obsessed with Li Bai. What are you trying to say? What I'm saying is... Did he spew a bunch of lies? Was he just some liar? If what Li Bai said wasn't true, then why do I feel so alive when I say it out loud? Don't people like us deserve a chance? For once, to prove that we're not born to be the butt of a joke, or to be picked on, or to be stepped all over! Your physiques aren't good enough. One more fish for each of you. Lion dancing is physically demanding. Thank you, Qiang! No... Thank you, Sifu! Don't thank me. Thank Li Bai. Why would you thank me? The horns have sounded Let's race back home Chasing the sun along the way And telling each other our feelings The sun dissipates into the night Creating an intoxicating and otherworldly scene Fold a paper plane And let it fly away with our dreams Grandpa said you're quite busy lately. What are you working on? I can't tell you just yet. It's gonna be a surprise. Don't let it affect your schoolwork. Got it. Focus on school. We'll work hard and bring money home. Be safe, Dad. Here's the money, sir. Later. Forget about the hardships and obstacles We strive hard towards the direction of our goal Our dreams and aspirations Fly, fly away Spread our wings and fly towards our dreams Our dreams and aspirations Are always on our minds The journey might be long But we'll never give up Every time we trip and fall We might hide in the corner alone But what still shines in our hearts Is the light of our initial intentions Rainbows appear after storms Sifu, is there a secret ultimate lion dance move? Sit properly! We learn from every defeat Then pick up our dreams and fly once more This jerk slacked off again. There's salted fish everywhere. If your passion remains, then fly with me Forget all the pain and loss The world can change but not our determination I'm a lion dance genius. I'm telling you! The pickled veggies go well with rice. Sifu. You should be our leader when we go to the competition. So we can feel more confident. What competition? What leader? What are you talking about? I've got mouths to feed! I'm only coaching you guys because you deliver fish for free. Don't even think about it. That's just great... I bet she's looking for stuff to beat me with! What were you thinking? Are you stupid? Why would you bring that up in front of Mrs. Qiang? What are we going to do now? Don't worry, Sifu. We'll try to stop her. Attaboy. Qiang! Help! It's their family's business, how can outsiders butt in? Eat up. This is a bit salty. I can explain, Jane... You kept it. I just forgot to throw it away. Starting from tomorrow, I'll be the one to make deliveries. You stay behind and watch over the store. You can coach them while you do that. Honey... Alright, alright... It's okay, ma'am. We can still make the deliveries. Yeah, it's like a workout for us. And we can get salted fish every meal. Look at this little dork. He can't keep his eyes away from his old team uniform. How old was he? Twenty. A little older than you guys. What was Sifu like? He was cool. He was the best lion dancer in town. That's amazing. Yeah. I miss the old times, too. I miss when he did the lion dance and how happy it made him. The first touch is on the forehead. May the auspicious star shine brilliantly! The second touch is on the eyes. May the path be clear and bright! What kind of groom would do the lion dance himself? How ridiculous! He's the best lion dancer around these parts. What's wrong with him doing it himself? Being good at the lion dance is useless. His happiness matters the most. Mind your own business. Happiness doesn't pay the bills. What a lost cause. Why did he stop? Making a living ain't easy. Being a lion dancer doesn't pay the bills. So I stopped him. Make sure you put your mind into this. Don't make a fool out of yourself during the competition. We definitely will! Don't you worry, ma'am. Doggie... Maybe you should use something else as the "drum." Don't worry, my belly is big and sturdy, it sounds like a drum when I hit it. Keep going! Clean the third cabinet on the left. I'm beat. I need a break. Take them to get a new lion head and a drum. Don't you feel embarrassed using a bamboo basket as the head? And that fatso, what he does is totally suicidal. Right, right, right we don't have kids, I guess we can treat them like they're our own. What are we practicing today, Sifu? I'm taking you guys somewhere today. Where? Hop on. What's wrong? Hop on. Are you sure about this? Yeah! Quit dilly-dallying! This motorcycle is from a good brand. It's great quality. Uh... Did something just pop, Sifu? Who lit up a fire cracker in broad daylight? Goodness gracious! Let's go! Time to put this great motorcycle to use! Hang on tight! This thing right here is a beast on the roads! We're here. Get off. Selected from the finest water buffalo, the leather has been sun dried multiple times. So, the drumbeat is stunning! Lion head craft has 600 years of history. The lion head needs to be vivid and rugged. Zhang Fei the Black Lion, Ma Chao the White Lion, Liu Bei the Yellow Lion and Guan Yu the Red Lion which I used to wield. What are you standing there for? Pick a lion head and a drum. Woah! Sifu. Now that we have a lion head, we can be a fierce lion, right? Here. Give me your best lion eyes. Nope. You need more practice. We've practiced for so long. Well, how about a friendly match? Nice to meet you. Pleasure to meet you. Alright, you've greeted each other. Since your sifu isn't here now, I'll be the judge. Are you okay with that? Yep. You were known as the Living Lion, and respected by many. You're also like an uncle to us! We rookies are so thankful for the honor of having you judge our friendly match. C'mon. Let's give him a round of applause! The rule is simple. Whichever team gets the lettuce wins. Here you go. Uncle, are there any other rules? Nope. Cheers. I thought you guys were trying to be a fierce lion? Show them what you've got! You can't pretend to be a true fierce lion. There, there. You three might look like losers, but that doesn't mean that you're real losers. Gyun! Although you're scrawny, you have the advantage as a lion head. However, you need high stamina. Kat, you're agile and have good balance like a monkey. It should be easy for you to jump around while holding someone so scrawny. Doggie is big and strong and has good arm strength. Also, after this friendly match, I've noticed that you three have one great strength. Your tenaciousness. Remember. No matter who your opponents are. A fierce lion always fights till the end. Sifu. What are our weaknesses then? Your looks. Good thing is, your faces are hidden under the lion. Other than that, you are all set. Understood. Thanks, Sifu. I ask the world Is this the tallest mountain? Perhaps There's another one taller than the sky In this world There are mountains taller than this one But when it comes to love I can't find one better than you There's always a taller mountain True love is as great as the sky No one knows who the world's most powerful martial arts master is This is your first time going on a stake. Wooden stakes represent a mountain. A lion dancing on wooden stakes is to depict a fierce lion as it picks the lettuce on a mountain. Your opponent is not other lions anymore. But the path under your feet. Watch every step. Every step needs to exhibit the spirit of a fierce lion. Sifu, how should we walk then? You got any secret moves? Listen to your heart. Do you hear a puny cat? Or a fierce lion? A fierce lion. There's always a taller mountain True love is as great as the sky No one knows who the world's most powerful martial arts master is Perhaps we all have the same goal but different paths But when it comes to love, I can't find one better than you In my world, you are the best Sifu, why is there a pole placed in front of the stake array? No one will jump onto that. That pole is called the Sky's Pillar. It's a reminder for the lion dancers to remain humble. And that there's always a "mountain" that they can't conquer. You were so amazing when you were young. I bet you could jump onto it. I... couldn't. Don't be an idiot and try to jump onto it. Where's Sifu? He went to buy something from the store. He told us to come first. This is the qualifier match we're talking about. Without Sifu... Attention, please. I'm a little freaked out. Now we'll begin to draw lots. The teams that get the same number will compete against each other. Why are you making deliveries alone on a hot sunny day? You can't carry that much fish by yourself, so you have to make multiple trips. I'm so sorry. I'll make the next trip quick. Don't worry. Where's Qiang? He... has important business to attend to. What important business can a loser has? He's a lion dance coach now. I just want him to focus on training the team. He's back at it again? Can't he grow up and realize it's more important to bring food to the table? What kind of a man would focus on stupid stuff like that? How are you supposed to make all these deliveries by yourself? You still have so many places to stop by. Look at the life you're living. Back then, if you'd... Alright, say no more. I'll get it over to you on time, don't sweat it. Where the heck is Sifu? Why did you come back? Here, honey, have some water. Go rest. I'll make this run. What are you doing? They're competing! Why aren't you there? Now is not the time to deliver salted fish. It's okay. Get off the scooter. You hear me? Haven't you ever regretted all these years? My feelings for you have never changed. I'm talking about me not letting you lion dance, and not letting you do those dangerous dance moves. Like other people, I told you to get a real job. I told you to make money. I told you to settle with selling salted fish. I'm the reason people call you a loser. I don't regret it. We have a good life together. But I do! Honey! I love you! You better win the championship! Or I'm going to break your legs! Team Chen's Village wins. It's our turn. Sifu is still not here. You guys seem nervous. Be careful, don't slip when you're up there. Or you'll end up like those guys. I've never heard of that team. Just treat it like a clown show. Are we really going to do this? I say forget it. We shouldn't ruin Sifu's reputation. Get up there! Are you guys going to do this or what? Get up there! What are you waiting for? Stop wasting time! I can't stand you guys! Let's do this! Sorry! I'm late. How did it go? It's okay. We can try again next time. Next time? Sifu! Thank you! I'd like to thank you guys, too. Let's go eat! I heard you guys did great today. Of course! Don't get cocky! The next round will be harder to win. You need to continue to practice. Yep! Now, let's eat! Yeah. Yeah. We're having a feast today! Gyun. Your dream is about to come true. What dream? I know. Gyun wants to compete in Guangzhou, so he can show his parents that he's no longer a puny cat. That's very nice of you. Here, have some more. Gyun! Your grandpa has been looking everywhere for you. What for? He said your parents are back. Go ahead! Allow me to excuse myself, Sifu. Thank you. I'm back, Grandpa! Dad! Mom! What happened? Is Dad asleep? Your dad fell when he was working on the construction site. His vitals are stable now, but he's still in a coma. What did the doctor say? The doctor said we can take him home and if a miracle happens, he might wake up. Your uniform... Gyun! Give him some space. I'm an idiot! This is my fault. I wasn't specific enough. I only asked them to return soon. I left out the "healthy and safe" part. Sometimes I really wonder if you actually exist. If you do, then why would this happen? Can you tell me what I need to do for the miracle to happen? Grandpa. Mom. I'm going to Guangzhou. Gyun. Mom. I've grown up. Don't worry about me. Stay home and take care of Dad and Grandpa. Don't worry about the money. I'll take care of it. We have to go! Alright, guys. I have to go. Thank you, Sifu, Mrs. Qiang. Quit with the long face. Train hard. I'll be back as soon as I make enough money. You can't participate in the competition without me. Gyun. Take good care of yourself in Guangzhou. We'll wait for you to come back. No matter what happens out there, you have to remember our team's drumbeat! As long as the drumbeat echoes in your heart, we'll always be a fierce lion! We have to keep being a fierce lion! Don't worry, Sifu! He'll be back. Hey, buddy You can slow down a little Carry your belongings Wear a red wreath on your head Forget all your sorrows I'll be your companion Rolling on Carpe diem Sing wim-wom-wom-bo Then keep rollin', rollin' on You only live once Hello? Gyun. How've you been? Hey, Gyun. When are you coming back? Come home soon! We're waiting for you to join the competition! Rolling on For our generation Most people take world-weariness as normal Perhaps in this world There's nothing worth looking forward to But that has nothing to do with me I'm just an idiot who wants to fly Life should be celebrated heartily Thanks, Boss. Let's split this among the three of us. As for the rest, we'll save it up for Gyun. So he can take care of his family. Alright. What do you think Gyun is doing now? I'm sure the big city life is too good for him to want to come back. Excuse me, where do I sleep? Under the bed. Hello? That little stinker... Sifu. Is Gyun never coming back? Should we keep practicing? Woah... your wound looks gnarly. What are they talking about? They said there's a gig that pays double. Are you interested? Where? Shanghai? Why leave in such a hurry? Mom. Don't worry. I'm going with a few friends. Did you get the money I sent you? Yeah. Oh, one more thing. Your three friends came this morning with some money. You mean Kat, Doggie, and Sifu? Right. I refused to accept it, but then they left it and ran off. I couldn't even chase after them. Gyun. I'm sorry that you're suffering because of us. Be more patient and tolerant out there. If you can't take it anymore, just come home. Mom... What are you talking about? I'm a grown man. I can provide for the family. Sifu. Why didn't they invite us to eat with them? Are you serious? We agreed to get our own dinner. They're stingy. It's just the three of us. Well, you're the one to blame for being so big. They're afraid you'd eat all their food. That's why they didn't invite us in. The Lion Dance Games will be held in Lychee Bay next week. To encourage the participants to spread the culture and tradition, great prizes will be given out to the champion in this tournament. Are we still going, Sifu? We're one person short. Many media channels will live stream the tournament. Sorry. Thank you. Is this yours? Yeah. Thank you. I'm heading in the same direction as the place you're dropping those parcels off. So, don't feel bad. Thank you. You are so young and starts working already. Just wanna gain more life experience. Oh, right! That lion head that I gave you, did you use it to practice lion dancing? No? That's a bummer. My family didn't want me to keep doing it because I'm a girl. So, after being the promotional ambassador this time, I won't compete in any games anymore. I was wondering if I'd see the young guy with the exact same name as mine, jumping and dancing with that red lion head I gave him. But never mind. This is it. Thank you. Hey. Don't forget that You're chosen by the Hero Flower! You can do it! Big cities are way too busy, so I didn't prepare much for you guys. I packed light. Alright. You guys might bump into Gyun. Remember to give these things to him. He's all alone in a big city. He has it rough. Okay. So... What if we don't see him? Then you bring all these back of course! Got it. Woah! It's a lion dance tournament! Gyun! Where are you going? Work. We're leaving tomorrow. I won't get paid if I don't go. You've taken multiple jobs, but you're still that in need of money? How much do you need? I don't know and that's the most terrifying part. That is really terrifying... Since plenty of teams made it through the qualifiers in every division, the agenda of this tournament is going to be very tight. The rematch will officially start at 9 o'clock tomorrow morning. Teams who have passed the rematch will go directly to the elimination round after a short break. Then we'll move to the finals. What happened to you? You're 30 minutes late! Do you know what the consequences are? Sorry. I've got way too many delivery orders. So that gave you the excuse to deliver ours last? We had to train with an empty stomach! That's enough. I'll pay you. You were a lion dancer? What the... The soup is all spilled out! You had one job. What a loser. I'm not a loser. Then what are you? As long as the drumbeat echoes in your heart, we'll always be a fierce lion! Sifu. Are you sure about doing this tomorrow? The tournament will last all day. Can you handle it? I don't have a choice. Why? Because the tournament will be live streamed. Do you know what that means? What? That means Gyun might see us. I might fall from the stakes, but I want Gyun to know: Do not surrender. Mhm, never surrender. So what if I'm old? I won't surrender. So what if I don't have enough strength? I won't surrender. I hope that Gyun won't surrender to what he's experiencing right now. Do you think Gyun is still practicing lion dancing? That's not important. Our lives are like a lion dance. There are ups and downs. Gyun has his own path. Sifu, I couldn't see the end of the mountain. I have no choice but to move forward. Where is your lion head? I'm leaving it behind. What a bummer. Woah, this place is bustling. Do you wanna check it out? Forget about it. We have a train to catch. Over a hundred teams showed up today. This is unprecedented. Hey, we're gonna miss the train. It's okay. The station isn't far. Not like we have anything to do, even if we get there early. Let's check it out. Now, let's welcome the lion dance teams with a round of applause. Let's do this. Alright. Seems like every team is ready to roll. Hurry, hurry! Now let's begin the first round of the tournament. Every team will perform their freestyle lion dance following the drumbeat. The judges will eliminate half of the teams according to their performance. Sifu, it has started. Are you meditating, Sifu? Has Sifu reached parinirvana? I'm waiting. What are you waiting for? It started a few minutes ago. I'm waiting for a judge to see us. Why? Are you stupid? There are way too many teams here. Why would I waste my strength when they're not looking at us? Get ready. Follow my footsteps. Then throw me upwards. Got it. Doggie. The bridge! Oh... the Bridge! Stand up slowly. - This team is amazing! - Yeah! Team Salted Fish's performance is outstanding! This team's lion head dancer is 45 years old. This is considered old for lion dancing. Why is he participating in such a fierce tournament? Is there a story behind this? Honey! That's my husband! Qiang? The loser? He's a champ! Now only half of the teams are left. The second round is Embroidered Ball Snatching. There will be four lanes. On the finish line of each lane, there will be only one embroidered ball. Whichever team gets the ball will enter the next round. Each team can send two lions at the most. Sifu, we only have one lion, there's no way we can beat them. Right. Let's not over think this. Hurry up and pick a lane with less teams. Team Salted Fish only erected one flag. Seems like they're just sending one lion for this round. That's a bold move. There is one lion less over at that lane. Let's go over there. Hurry, go over there. I can't go any further. Stop moving. Sifu, this lane had the least people, now it has the most people. Don't sweat it. Let's switch. Go back. Alright. Hey! You guys saw that right? The Salted Fish guys are good. How about we each use one lion to work together and kick them out of the tournament? He has a point. You guys are funny. We're being serious! Ready! Go! Seems like the battle in Lane 3 is the most fierce! Many teams are falling into the water. Looks like the Salted Fish team is being ganged up on by the other teams! But the rules for this round don't forbid teams from joining forces. Sucks for that team. Sifu! I can't hold up much longer! Shut up and save your energy! We have to keep being a fierce lion! Sifu, what should we do? Sifu, are you sure you're not hiding some secret ultimate moves? Alright then. It's time to reveal my secret weapon. Years of hard work and suffering, and pain... All of those things have cost me sweat and blood. But as a result, I've obtained something that most people don't have... Salted... Fish... Feet! I thought that Sifu trained us underwater was to increase our lung capacity. I never would have guessed it was actually for this moment. Sifu. Your feet don't stink anymore! What's going on? Who brings air freshener to a tournament? The other 3 lanes have finished this round. Only Lane 3 is still fighting over the ball. Team Salted Fish is obviously struggling with only one lion. We can see that they're tiring out. Alright, let's go. How dare you use your stinky feet on us! This is going to be the end of you! Team Salted Fish set up an ambush beforehand! Now there's a young man holding the team's flag at the end of the lane. He brought the second lion. Gyun! Sifu! I'll take over. Hurry, Kat! I'm full of energy right now. Bring it on! Amazing! The battle at Lane 3 is finally over! We officially have the four teams who are going to the semi-finals! Gyun. Sifu. Sorry I'm late. Son, you've gotten stronger. Hey, Gyun. We're going to the semi-finals. The top four teams will be dueling one-on-one. This round of competition is Lettuce Picking. An array will be setup on the stage and there will be five heads of lettuce. Contestants must complete the competition without damaging the array. The first team to obtain three heads of lettuce will win. Ready. Team Limitless defeated the mighty Team Chen's Village with ease. They're the first team qualified for the final. Team Salted Fish wins! This team that wasn't very well-known is definitely a dark horse in this year's tournament! They've done amazingly and turned their situations around! Team Salted Fish will enter the final against Team Limitless! That guy looks familiar. He's the food delivery boy. Gyun. We're counting on you. Those guys are ruthless. I got carried away and I failed to dodge their attack. Ladies and gentlemen! A thrilling final is about to begin! Please give a round of applause to Team Limitless and Team Salted Fish! Focus. This year's tournament has revived many traditional events. Today's final will be conducted with the traditional long bench array. The long benches might seem harmless, but it's difficult to stay balanced on them. We saw what Team Limitless is capable of. This match is going to be a tough battle for Team Salted Fish. Begin! A little show of dominance! Team Salted Fish is catching up again! They have an advantage with speed. Team Limitless once again has the upper hand. Team Salted Fish caught up again! Amazing stamina! The match is getting intense! Woah! This kick! Can Team Salted Fish withstand it? Going toe-to-toe like this puts Team Salted Fish at an extreme disadvantage! Team Salted Fish is striking back! Both teams are clinging to the bench with their legs! The conditions are getting even more difficult! We have a result! It's a tie! We have a tie! Unbelievable! Looks like we're entering overtime! Does it hurt? Nope. Don't try to act tough. Safety first. Sifu. All of us want to win for once in our lives. Right. The overtime will be conducted with the stakes we used during the exhibition match! Each team will perform a lion dance and will be scored by the judges. This stake array is the tallest in the history of this tournament. The tallest stake, the Blue Stake is 16 meters, and the distance between stakes is twice as far as the conventional arrays. After the intense battle just now, this is a true test of stamina for both teams. First, we have a topnotch team in this year's tournament! Team Limitless! Go, go! Team Limitless hopped onto the array with style! Seems like they're very determined to win the championship! The water splash is also called "jian cai." Seeing wealth It's a metaphor for good fortune! Gyun. Your foot. Team Limitless is about to reach the top! The Blue Stake is the last hurdle for their success! Team Limitless made it to the Blue Stake smoothly! They've completed the most challenging part! They should score pretty high. Team Limitless' performance is flawless! Champion! Champion! This is not looking good for Team Salted Fish! Wait! Seems like Team Salted Fish has a situation. He needs rest. Do you have another team member? I can take his place! No, contestants are not allowed to switch teams. Why? A rule is a rule! What kind of stupid rule is that? We forfeit. Sifu. I can do it. Gyun. We made it all the way to the final. We've proven ourselves. Sifu. You told us a fierce lion fights until the end. Team Salted Fish has decided to continue! Such amazing willpower! Are you ready? Go get 'em, lion. Are you holding up alright? Yeah. Get ready. Okay. That's amazing! There was a hiccup, but they saved themselves from it! Fascinating! Despite the imperfection, their performance showcased extreme vividness! Let's see how the judges are going to score them. Alright, Gyun. All we have to do now is jump over there steadily. For some reason, he's staring at the Sky's Pillar. Is he wanting to challenge jumping onto it? However, the judges told me just now. It's impossible to make it to the Sky's Pillar. Don't be silly, Gyun. The purpose of the Sky's Pillar is to remind the contestants that there is always a taller mountain out there and there will always be miracles that they can't achieve. Kat. Do you believe in miracles? Only one person can make it there. Will you give me a hand? What the... Dad, what is going on there? That's lion dancing. What is that? Our ancestors were fearful of the Nian Beast. So they put on a charming lion head to repel the beast and dispel the fear among us. Alright. Take a look! How to go up How to go down Praying to a deity is useless You have a hard life, but you're melodramatic I, Gyun, will bring honor to my family Well, now being looked down on, unable to let go, and broke Don't you worry, I'll do great things in the future My family will surely be better off someday The audience is going wild! He created a miracle! What? Don't belittle me Only the incompetent blame society And you said you want to go out there? What do you wanna do? Hey, don't you laugh at me Bro, don't you belittle me All my bros will make it out there Don't look down on us Even if we can only afford a tricycle now Grandpa, uncles, grandma, and mom There are always ups and downs in life Grandpa, uncles, grandma, and mom There are always ups and downs in life Grandpa, uncles, grandma, and mom There are always ups and downs in life Grandpa, uncles, grandma, and mom There are always ups and downs in life Ah, how to go up Ah, how to go down Ah, how to go up Grandpa, uncles, grandma, and mom.

Come take a look I'm a nameless person on the road I have no story and no one talks about me I'll give everything I have So I can lead a normal life Dying to live a life only to survive I'm a person who left home A person who earns their bread in tears A person who is on the road A person who is providing for the family And a silent noise in the background of a city I just want to feel Every moment I struggle Are all the wet footprints I left behind worth it? If you also get choked up Then you're a friend on the same path as me To all the ordinary people who are indomitable Cheers to the nameless Cheers to your silence and roars Cheers to your suffering while walking to the top Living and surviving with your head under the horizon You came from a southern village Raised by a pair of rough hands You're standing between buildings But you don't back away I came from the Spring in the North Looking back one step at a time Behind me is the intersection where I said goodbye to home And the warmth during every sunset When my hometown enters winter When the train arrives to the station The breeze of my childhood blows again As I reminisce over the joy of innocence On the familiar streets Someone will say out loud With a voice full of tenderness Your name Cheers to those who left home Cheers to your silence and roars Cheers to your suffering while walking to the top Living and surviving with your head under the horizon Cheers to the nameless Cheers to your silence and roars Cheers to your suffering while walking to the top Living and surviving with your head under the horizon Oh, we are the nameless ones Oh, we are the nameless ones Your ride is here Don't look back if there's too much worry Oh, we are the nameless ones Let's hit the road Carry on with Your dream
