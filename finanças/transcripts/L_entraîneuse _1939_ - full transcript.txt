NIGHTCLUB HOSTESS Speech, speech! Dear friends, in spite of the heat of this oppressive July, you have delayed your vacations that you have deserved so richly, remaining in Paris to fete the President of your board of directors. I'm touched and thank you for this. At the end of a particularly successful managerial year, we celebrate not so much our profits as the friendship that unites us, that unites all members of our board and our board to all our workers. In the work of art you have given me, I like to see the symbol of professional integrity triumphing over all obstacles. My friends, I raise my glass to the prosperity of the French footwear industry... I ask you... Speeches in this heat. I can't wait to go to the countryside. Obviously, nobody's going to be out dancing. Couldn't they have let us off a day earlier? If you're still hoping for graciousness from a dive like this... "Closing tomorrow for renovation. Re-opening in 15 days." Is anyone in the gaming room? It's not a big crowd, Mr. de Lormel but the game has started. Well, the Good Lord's about to kick off. Yes, but it won't bring the crowds flocking in. Mr. de Lormel, your seat is No.1. - Thanks. You'll receive you hand shortly, sir. - Call Suzy, would you? Suzy? I'll see if she's here, sir. Well, good evening. - Seat No.1? With Suzy's backing? You planning something big? - The worst, I won't hide it. 125 louis au banco. - Banco of 125 louis. Half with you? - Ah no, forgive me. But when Suzy's here, whatever you like. - Then banco just for me. Since it's the last evening, not too many sandwiches. We can't sell them tomorrow. Anyone seen Suzy? ... you know, that doesn't thrill me much... Are you going by car? - Yes, of course. What make is the motor? - Oh me and car makes, you know... All I know is that it's red and has a grey leather interior. Suzy is wanted in the gaming room. She's cleaning her dress... and may I remind you, you're not allowed in here. Oh don't fret... who hasn't seen your ass around here? And you're not going anywhere? - No, I'm staying in Paris. Robert had promised me, but it hasn't worked out. Everyone will be leaving except you. When there's two of you... You must come and see me in my little house. A few pennies at a time, it took time to pay off but now it's all mine. And now I can receive people. People... that might interest a doll like you. Have you finished playing the pimp? She needs to take a deep breath, this kid. I could tell you about somewhere good. I'm broke, old bean. But at Rocagne-sur-mer we live for practically nothing with a large forest close to the sea. Where there are trees, it's always muggy. Is Rocagne where you're going? - Oh, I have to sing, me. And plus, when it's a place you went as a child it's nice, but when you loved someone there, it's best not to go back. Suzy, de Lormel's asking for you in the game. Try to hurry up. Okay, I'll be right there. There, now the stain won't show. - Thanks, Mrs. Courtois And if sometime you need 200F, feel free to call me. Say, can't you leave them alone now you have your own place? I haven't paid for central heating yet. Do you know how much that is? Customers may be scarce, but the price is always the same. I apologise for bothering you again with my superstitions. I realise that standing behind my chair can't be much fun for you. - Oh you know... ... dancing with sweaty guys, telling you their life stories, it's even less fun. Unfortunately, it's what they pay me for. Ah, no... you can go after my first hand. The tricky bit, you see, is to attract luck. This doesn't work every time. - That's because you lack faith. The faith that moves mountains... and brings wins in banco. Places please, the game continues. You'll see... 50 louis in the bank. - Banco. And 8. 9. Faith, kiddo. Empty your glass! You're on in 5 minutes, come on! Sing for these three clodhoppers, really?! Do I pay you to sing, or to get drunk? It'll only irritate those two cracking jokes and the other one who's trying to sleep things off. I get the impression our president's celebrated French footwear a bit too much. To get him back on track, a little woman might do the trick better than us. Okay then, let's have a stroll to the gaming room. In front of us, he'll try to retain his dignity. Although I could tell you a thing or two... My dear president, may we be permitted a few games of banco? Erm... Yes, go ahead... don't be too long. Time enough to lose 100 louis. - And for me to win them from him. In the absence of those gentlemen, I could keep you company. I'm sorry, Miss, it's not something I usually do. Not something he usually does... because we were there and he didn't dare. Once we close the curtain, the president will be 15 years younger. You know, I'd like to see that. Nothing could be easier. Here, look up there. That babe, she's just his type. Miss, we have a friend who's all alone. The table opposite, over there. You'll definitely appeal to him... but don't tell him we sent you. Gotcha. He'll look her up and down several times, then he'll remember us and check we aren't about. He invited her. I used to think he was one of the inconsolable widowers. Don't you know that they're the sort that lays on the biggest parties? I wanted to sit at his table, he blew me off. And then he invites Suzy. I'm better than her. For all that, he looks interested... And tonight they feted me. Hearing their praise, you discover that you're misunderstood. A woman would have found... the right words. The attention, the warmth... My wife is dead. You wouldn't understand. - I understand perfectly. Some more champagne? - I'd like that. I was putting off going home... ... I was so afraid of my empty apartment. And the end of an evening that was looking so grim is suddenly full of promise. And I am certain... ... that you keep your promises. Don't talk so loudly, Fréhel's about to sing. # In this bistrot, by the locks # # I serve drinks to the seafarers. # # I sing too for the nighthawks # # Words that appeal to philanderers... # You know what would be nice? When my friends leave, I'll have to go with them. I'll split from them at the street corner and I'll wait for you there. Sorry, a friend is collecting me. But we can drink another bottle. Let's take it somewhere else. Wherever you like. I could so easily make you happy... ...and you could so easily do the same for me. You would be my holiday and the little things that you lack would be mine to get you. There's nothing I'd like more ... but I can't. #... This is my life forever more. # You just got on one vast and improbable roll! I'm sorry that my luck worked against you. You regret it, perhaps? - To be honest, I'm rather glad. Here, your friends are coming back. Then, miss, we have nothing more to say to each other. Good evening. Good evening, sir. Well, gentlemen, did lady luck favour you? Yes, fleeced. - Washed out. Charming place... Truly we'd have been better off going straight home to bed. Waiter. You know, after you left my luck continued. I definitely owe it to you. - Oh no. - Yes. Mind if I open your bag? - Listen, you don't owe me anything. I don't owe you anything, but it makes me happy to give it to you. Because you're a nice little girl who needs to buy lots of things before departing for her holiday. The only thing is I'm remaining in Paris. What? Your Robert isn't taking you somewhere? It's not his fault. Look, I don't want it to seem like I'm bad-mouthing him but you could do a lot better. There was no reason we got together, there's none either for us to part. He's a good sort, plus... Here. This 3000F won't get you two very far, but I'd be happy to imagine that you'll get some happiness on me. Good evening. Good evening. - Gentlemen. It's amazing how friendly people can be who've just given you 20 notes. Really... I can't find the words to thank you. Then don't look. Show me your eyes are smiling. There, we're quits. You want a lift home? No. - Why? No, Robert's coming to get me. Okay, goodbye then, Suzy. Look, the two of us being miserable together would be no consolation to anyone. Therefore I jumped at the chance and I depart in an hour. Whatever, it's pretty thoughtless. Maybe we're married and I hadn't realised... One of us has found a way to go, and if it had been you you wouldn't have had a problem with it instead of sulking like this. I thought we'd be spending the holidays together so... it takes time to get used to this. You know, I'm something of a joker, you've no sense of humour so this couldn't have lasted. You're right. It's much better that we split up. Couples that don't make each other happy, they shouldn't persist. You make it sound so wonderful. Little Fernand and Big Charles told you it wasn't working out by sending you flowers or chocolate drops? Since I'm in agreement, no need to rake over all that. Don't worry about me. In one of these departing trains, there'll be a place for me. I'd rather we parted as friends. Good luck. Pavillon des (??), the best place around. Sam and his orchestra. Hôtel du casino... afternoon sensations... 210 rooms... Miss... what you're looking for is just the opposite of what these men are touting, isn't it? That's right, yes. My sort of customer, I recognise them at once. I want an inexpensive boarding house. Yes, gotcha. Climb up. Careful, it's a bit tricky. There. We won't go too fast. Toby is as thirsty as Raymond. Raymond? - Yes, I'm Raymond, Toby's the horse. If you will, Toby... He's a good animal, he just needs asking politely. I don't know where you're taking me. Where I'm taking you? Not far, to a baroness. Last winter, in the same week she lost the baron and her fortune. As a result, she turned her château into a boarding house. Oh, nothing but good people there. I select them. It's the life of Reilly, let me tell you... real family living. Except for the bill they give you on Saturday, it's like being a guest. Mind if we stop? - Go ahead. Just time for a quart of Vichy. - I'm not thirsty, but be my guest. Keep an eye on Toby, eh? - Yes. A good stiff Pernod. Coming right up, the waiter'll be there. How much? - 192 smackers since last night. And you didn't want my slot machines... These things always lead to trouble. Why? Don't I seem serious? But if it's a problem, I can find them another home, you know. The Cyrano's been asking for one for a month. And I can't furnish them one, so... - Hold on... The customers keep playing and slide in another 20. Tell me about it. You know, I can't carry this around like that. Well, fetch me a nice note. Here. You're not swindling me? - No, I'm not swindling you. You tell your maid to tidy my room upstairs. I might bring someone back... You never know. - Will do. Good hunting. - Thanks, landlord. May I? - Please do. What the hell are you doing up there? - I'm here to rest. Your dive has gone bust? No, it's too hot so they've closed for 15 days. Robert's not here? - He's in Paris. Well, send him my best wishes. And tell him I've found a gold mine. Ten slot machines in the local bistros, can you believe it?. By the way I'm lodging here, if you want to see me. Goodbye then, Suzy. Goodbye. We'll be late for dinner. That quart of Vichy hit the spot. I have to be careful, I've a sensitive liver. If you will, Toby... Let's go. A river... of southern Africa in 7 letters with an I at the end. You can't keep bothering us with this! - Lucienne! I've already asked you to mind how you talk, and you might give it a rest, at least during meals. Ignorant like you are, I don't see how you get any fun out of that. Since you're so clever, tell me this river. The Zambezi. - The Zambezi... Strike a light, that's it. Fine, at least there'll be no more talk of it. Ah, there you are, as the meal's ending. This is good manners. Excuse me, auntie, an interminable game of tennis. He's such a klutz. He always gets the broken chair. You'll pay for that. Your mockery gets wearisome after a while. I'm starting to regret asking you here. Auntie, if you don't recognise you don't mean what you say, I'll swallow my knife. And I beg you to show good table manners. Right, I'm swallowing it. André, come on! How did he do that? - I know the trick. If you continue, I'm quitting the table. You're always saying this, and always stay because you're having most fun. Of course I'm having fun, but keep it within reason, children. Look out, the captain is preparing his drops. Not this stupid joke again! - ... 5... 6... - ... 9... 12... 24... Captain, I'm sorry once again. I apologise. It was you, Madam, who made me lose track! Oh yes, not them. I'm used to them but your voice surprised me. Don't blame them. All the drops in the world won't do me as much good as the vicinity of their youth. Let's raise our glasses to the digestion of Captain Loiseau. Well said, Jean. He poured me vinegar! I'll get you! - If you can! I'll bring you his hide! - You have to catch me first. Madam... Come with me, my child. She's some looker... - Who? The baroness? Moron! - Who's a moron!? My dear captain, I'm short of places and would you accept at your table this delightful child who is newly arrived? Miss... - Miss Michelet. The pleasure is all mine, miss. - Many thanks, captain. Was the dinner good, madam? - Very nice. Are you coming to dance, Pierre? No, I don't dance... Especially not with my sister. Madam... You forgot your handbag. Very kind of you, miss. I'm sorry I can't keep you company, miss, but after meals I need to take a short stroll. If you can find something among all this that suits you... Liver... kidneys... The spleen... Excellent for the spleen... don't be shy. At my age, one doesn't give flowers but pharmaceutical products. Bon appétit, miss. - Thank you, sir. Look out, lads! Did you bring the new arrival? - Yes. You know her name? I knew she'd spark your interest. Is she on her own?... - Has she come from Paris? Yes, she's come from Paris. She is alone. And her first name starts with an S. Simone? - Solange? - No... Sidonie. Before getting too carried away, we should have another look. We'll look like two idiots. Let's pretend to be looking for Aunt Louise's handbag. She's always losing it. Well? Did she tell you where she left it? She usually hangs it on her chair. I can't see anything. Well, try under the table. Why don't you do it yourself? We weren't mistaken. In the process, we look like two nuts... - Get away. Pardon, miss, you haven't noticed a black handbag? Our aunt's bag. - She forgot it... - And we're searching. A handbag with a silver zip? - That's it. Well, I just remarked to your aunt that she'd forgotten it. Therefore you need look no further. It's under her arm. Then excuse us. - Please. Madam, mummy is waiting for bridge. - I'll be right there. Pierre, there's talk of going to the village in a group. Do you want to come with us? No, I'm reading something fascinating. You could read it later. - No, I want to read it now. I could stay here, if you'd rather. We could dance. My dear Fanny, I very grateful to you for always offering me distractions I can assure you, I'm not bored. Pierre... why won't you flirt with me? Fanny, why don't people like spinach? All the young men are courting me. You won't even look at me. Why? The same answer... spinach. Very well... don't partake. Excuse me. - I beg your pardon. Madame, sorry to disturb you, do you have a book I could borrow? Nothing could be simpler. They're arranged alphabetically by author's name. Could you recommend something? Do you know "Serge Panine" by Georges Ohnet? The most beautiful book ever written. Full of truths. I'm wanted for a game of bridge. Find it under O. Miss, would you do something that would make me very happy? If I can. It's very simple... Pardon. ... leave this book alone. It's not by a good author? The baroness maintains her kitchen better than her library. I don't know what to recommend. I've read very little. - But you like reading? I think I do. - You're not sure? I ought to tell you that I've never read a book. This can't be. Serials in the papers, magazines at the hairdressers but... ...never a real book. You realise this is a disturbing confession. It's a bit daft really. I'm so taken aback because I've read so much in the last ten years. It's my greatest pleasure. Then you shouldn't have any problem recommending something. I'll be surprised to find here any of the books I like. The poet is making his sales' pitch. You think that babe's attractive? - Very much. It's a strange kind of person that turns people's heads like this. She must be having fun... French literature in 15 lessons. I'll show my devotion by rescuing her. When she blows you off, I'll appear and carry her off. You poor sap... All these books are hopeless. But I'm not asking for much. Excuse me miss, would you grant me this dance? No thank you, I don't dance. Excuse me. You don't dance?! You don't read?! You're lying to one of us. - To that gentleman. He's my cousin. A bit daffy... but a good sort. He's a big hit. It's a tribute that he invited you. So you can't find anything for me? - No. Miss, do you play ping-pong? - No, I've never tried. I'd be happy to show you. - Well, not this evening. Then some other time. Another cousin. Another good sort. And it's another tribute on his part. Gallantry seems to run in your family. Take this book. The one you're reading? - Yes. I'll happily lend it to you now. - Why now? Because you refused to go with Jean and André to chat with me. You're very kind. I'll take care of it. Good night. Good night. I like that young girl. The three boys seem to agree. I'd be happy to see her join your gang. A well-behaved friend would do you a world of good. She is most gracious, that child. She's going up. Let's see which room she's in. Why didn't you bring her along instead of boring her senseless? I thought you'd already invited her. Don't worry, I'm sure she now regrets it. That's funny, that's what I was about to tell you. But how did she manage it, Lucienne? She simply asked Suzanne to accompany us. Suzanne was very keen... She said no to us. - She said yes to Lucienne. You don't understand women, you. Is Pierre coming with us? - I hope not. Besides, his tyre is flat. That wouldn't have been you by any chance? Look out, don't forget the key for the sardine tin. Can I help? - Oh no, it's done. Salt for the hard-boiled eggs. And Pierre? If I ask him to come with us, he'll do a runner. Just because I'm his sister. Better if you go and get him. I think it's miss who has the best chance of getting him. You want to try? - Yes, okay. - Room 12. Don't forget that this afternoon, Suzanne is all mine. I clear the decks to give you a chance, and this evening it's you who goes AWOL. That will be too late. She'll be in love with me. Come in. What is it? I'm washing. We're going on a picnic. - What's that? We're cycling to the cape. - Whatever. Then you're not coming? Thanks one again for your good intentions, but I prefer to stay here. The others wanted me to insist. Cycling's not my bag. Picnics, no way. Your delicious personality and your delicious family are starting to grate on me. I'm not Fanny. - Eh? Oh, it's you. Excuse me, I'll be right there. I'll put on my dressing gown. Fanny doubted she'd get a warm welcome so she sent me instead. So you're going cycling in the sun and eating ant sandwiches? Your sister kindly asked me along. You didn't keep it long, that look you had yesterday. You're already one of the gang. Can you blame me? - Oh, it stands to reason. Go play tennis, go jump in a lake... My cousins are much more fun than me. The only thing is my book... you must give it back. Oh, already? Enjoy your 40 degrees in the shade, giant spiders sneaking up on you, and I ask once and for all that the young society girls leave me in peace. Very well. I've only two responses: firstly, don't bare your fangs on an empty stomach in the morning, and secondly, you have soap behind the ears. Goodbye. - Goodbye. #... I wouldn't give my place for the tea in China # # I wouldn't give my place, it's good and couldn't be finer. # # All my troubles fade away, hope is in my heart. # # To all the people that sashay, I cry I'm making a fresh start. # # The best of fortune could not make me happier # # I'd refuse the moon, I couldn't be snazzier... # SECONDARY SCHOOL FOR BOYS It amuses you, eh, ringing the bell to summon the teacher? It's our revenge. I'd line up by order of size, but it's not easy when it's just you. I've brought something that you'll like. You shouldn't have, lad, because I am going to yell at you. What? On the day I bring you a bottle of Pommard?! Pommard! Pommard is good stuff. However I'm still going to yell at you. Let's go up, there are fewer flies in the classrooms. Mr. Moreau! I'm waiting for you in Room 3 for your History lesson. Oh, what a drag! Every time I come in here, it troubles me a little. Everywhere built for a crowd is weird when it's empty. Oh, the flies! That where you're sitting? - Oh yes, laddie. For 37 years I've had the honour of teaching, and I've noticed that all one has to do is sit behind a desk for nobody to listen to you. But today, when it would be a pity if my words are lost, I'm sitting myself here. Here, uncork the Pommard. Oh, but it's true that something's amiss with you. Dear boy, someone of your age who prefers to every distraction the company of a dodderer like me... something's wrong. It's concerning, even. Every working day, I urge youngsters to work under the direction of (??) But on days off, I allow myself to speak honestly. Well, everything they teach in schools is a joke. And everything I can teach you is just to dumb you down. Pour the Pommard. But you're the only one I find entertaining. It's not usefulness bothers me, simply the enjoyment of it. But this is what's unnatural. My boy, at your age, I knew the fever of studiousness. While others were out chasing women, I spent my youth writing about Goethe and about Plato, something completely useless. I failed at my vocation... Thanks. I failed to reach the heights... And still I'm so poor that my August is spent covering for the caretaker and correcting the holiday homework of the student Moreau, that pitiful dunce they've assigned me. None of that really bothers me. What really hurts is the thought of the women I could have had, and that I missed because of those two wackos. Your Pommard is good. I'll give you the rest of the bottle if you tell me: "I won't be here tomorrow, I'm meeting a girl I fancy." "She may be a fool, but she's driving me crazy." "Your Plato and your Goethe, they can go hang". It's funny... because that is what I was going to say... ...only more politely. Oh, how happy you've made me! How I envy you! Well, here you are, Mr. Moreau! As I was about to say... I'd like to hear you list the 6 main clauses of the Treaty of Westphalia. I don't know them, sir. However you were playing ball without a care in the world. Mr. Moreau, you're a dunce. And I'm sorry to have to tell you once again, that the future holds for you some cruel disillusionments. And you aren't getting out of here until you know Louis XIV like the back of your hand! Notice to amateurs, some ham sandwiches remain as does the house speciality: warm sardines. Is there anything left to drink? - The beer spilled in the cheese. Don't mind, it was boiling hot. You want a peach? - Okay. Throw it. You want to share? - No thanks. I thought after lunch you're leaving us. - I'll leave you to it. Oh, he has to leave us already. - Kids, I must take my leave. Why are you going? - This isn't nice... - It's a long story. Don't forget, this evening I'm taking you both to the Casino. To the Casino? - I'll tell you about it. Can't you can stay with us? We'll meet up later. André, put the basket away, it attracts the wasps. Where's Jean going? It's a rule we have... no questions. Everyone often goes their own way. Besides, I've got to go too. A boyfriend? Someone I'm very keen on. Only the boys have free run, my aunt keeps close tabs on me. Therefore I have to make arrangements to meet him. What are you plotting like that? Isn't that your Romeo tooting his horn? Oh I'm sure when you have a car like that, we'll hear your horn! So, you get the idea... As far as auntie's concerned, we were together all afternoon, eh? The things she makes us do! Have you been waiting long? - I've been honking for 5 minutes. Come on, let's go. Haven't you had enough of this spot and all these snoring people? Where else do you want to go? - You'll see. See. It wasn't worth repairing, they're leaving it to rot, so without telling anyone, I've taken it over and made it mine. It's not so easy boarding your place. Fortunately, otherwise I'd have visitors like on the "Normandie". Come on, jump! The voyage begins. The boats's not so bad, just in dry dock. Because we're at low tide. We must be careful not to be trapped, we couldn't get off. Sit down. I'll make you some coffee. - No? You can do that? Ah, wait until you taste this! Say Freddy, is my room tidy? Not a sock in sight and flowers on the mantelpiece. Lend me your record player with three records, I don't care which ones. Take it all upstairs and pour us some of your absinthe, the real stuff. Say, two sips of that and she won't be able to get up the stairs. Don't you worry about that. I beg your pardon, I feared I'd be called from Paris. I said I'm not here. Nice of you to sacrifice your business. You know me, when I'm in love... You're barely older than my brother. When he needs 10F, he has to ask daddy for them. Whereas you... - Oh yes, but I work hard! Not that I'm complaining. Here, try some of this. Isn't it too strong? - That's what you think... ... it's sweet as syrup. It needs some sugar as well. There. I'm going to prepare it properly for you. You're really amazing. It's a pity you don't trust me. When I ask you to dinner, it's impossible. If I want to take you to the cinema, you won't. Oh no, this is unkind. In my room upstairs, I've a collection of great records, with a first-class record player. You want to come up and listen? - No. You see, every time it's no. It's because it's always the same thing you're asking me. Young girls like you are always seeing traps everywhere. You think I don't know how to conduct myself? Can't I be nice without... - Look, I'm not as dumb as you think. I know very well where I'm going and what I risk. So, show a little patience. We'll see later, at the Casino. And then... - Here, drink. It's strong. Number 34. Red, even and pass. Come on gentlemen, place your bets. 25 louis... I've heard it's snobbish to only like the really fancy joints. Well, I admit it, I like expensive things. Luxury. If I want to gain a lot of money, it's so I can spend a lot. Yes, but the difficult bit is to gain it. If I've come to the Casino, it's because I need 1500F. That won't get you very far. Rockefeller started by shining shoes. I need it to start me off. If you agree to stand behind me, I'm sure I can get them. You'll win or you'll lose, I'll have nothing to do with it. No, there's a certain confidence you can give me. Yes, the faith that moves mountains... 4... 8. Ah, at last! Well, that's not bad! You're going to make it up. - I'm not so sure. 19 louis en banco, gentlemen. - Shall I go for it? Doesn't anyone want this banco of 19 louis? 19 le banco... - Banco. 8. 7. What a jinx! This is your fault too! You couldn't have told me to stick, eh?! Hey, that's Lucienne's boyfriend. He doesn't seem too chuffed. I didn't want to come to the Casino. It was another one of your ideas. It was so we could be together, not to play. Yes, to exchange pleasantries and stare into each other's eyes, eh? This is starting to bug me. You well know that unlucky in cards... Oh, how nice you are when we're all alone. And with that, I'm all cleaned out. You wouldn't have 200 or 300F in there? I didn't anticipate this. I've got maybe 20F. 20F... Well, that'll allow us a drink. Barman. Dealer passes. - This place is free. So you won't play some more? I'm not a gambler. I needed 1500F. I've got it, it's over. All that remains is to make a fortune. Well, tomorrow morning, if you like, you can come with me and I'll show you the project I'm working on. And there too, you'll bring me luck. Come on, I owe Lucienne and her boyfriend a whiskey. No, listen, I'd rather not. Why? You know him? No. Five minutes. Lucienne would be upset. Marcel Giron... Ms Suzanne Michelet. Miss. What'll you have, Lucienne? - A whiskey. - Two whiskeys then. You got a sudden yen for cycling? I thought peddling in the sun wasn't your bag? That depends. Will you take a spin with me? - Jean's already asked me. Yeah, I see how it is... You're the busy type. You must be asked at least 8 days in advance. Come swimming with us later. - No. I've already told you what I think about such frolics. Getting ready for the Tour de France? - I've had it with all of you! Don't get your knickers in a twist... Shall we get going? And when you meet him, say hello for me to Victor Hugo. SPARE PARTS Sale - Purchase - Exchange Follow me and be careful. Some time ago, I was looking for inspiration. Passing here, it suddenly struck me. It's the only way inspiration strikes. It's a car graveyard. It was a car graveyard, because now it's mine. You bought it? - With what? No. I offered the owner to free him of all this. He thought I was nuts and agreed. - And what are you going to do with it? Obviously when one brings one's car here it's no good for anything and I don't intend to fix any of them, but in all of them are things that still function. A headlight, a horn, a wheel. Refurbished, I sell them... at least I try to sell them. And it's working out? So far I've only sold one horn but if you knew how happy that 15F made me... And this gentleman under the hood is Gustave, my foreman. The money I need is mostly to pay him. Hello, boss. He thinks I'm a lunatic but when he calls me "boss" I feel like Daddy Ford. Hello, Gustave. For your money, talk to Accounts. Are you on to something? The motor... maybe it can still run. Did you hear that? - I'm making no promises. Try your best. And if a client comes along, I'm here. A client? - Yes. The guy who took the horn promised he'd give us some publicity. Over here is the workshop and my temporary office. Allow me to show you the way. It's the real deal, eh? The tools... the table with my books... and here's the merchandise. It's marvelous, you've got a good set-up. But the most important thing, Suzanne, I wanted to tell you it here. All this money I want and will have one day, I don't want it for myself so much... but for a woman who believed in me... before my name was written on the Eiffel Tower. It seems to me any woman would like such a hope. But you... would you like it? The thing is, you've only sold one horn, let me wait until you've sold a dozen. Only eleven to go then. With the publicity that bloke will give me. Is the motor running? - Not a hope... There's a client... - You see, when you're with me... It's the same client as the other day. He says the horn doesn't work, so he wants his money back. Only twelve to go. Excuse me. What are you doing? - My job. Oh no! Enough of this! Well, what would be a good time we can clean your room? You're always in here! I've had enough of your appliances. And I've seen enough of you already! Don't you know it's beautiful outside?! There are little birds singing and maidens showing their legs. What you can't grasp is some prefer pen and paper to all that. Me? It doesn't impress me, I think it's daft. I know what comes next... You're going to tell me you don't mind scrubbing floors and the only thing that pains you in life is the thought of all the women you missed. How did you know that? The fifty-somethings' disc is on repeat... You think I haven't heard it before? It's a pity you don't also know the record of shy young people. You'd enjoy that too. You think I shut myself in here out of shyness? I saw you fixing your bike this morning. Mr. Jean a carried off the doll so you bury your nose in your papers and you die of boredom, and you die of jealousy. Me? - Yes, you! Instead of being on the beach standing up for yourself, showing that you're no more clumsy than anyone else. I don't make my conquests in a swimming costume. And why are you getting involved anyway? Do I give you advice on the best feather duster? If I told you to get lost, how would you answer? I'd answer that I put it in the left-hand drawer. What? Your swimming costume. - You're driving me crazy! I'm a fool, okay, a poor fool but I can lock myself in here to sleep and to stew if I like! Get lost! I'm not going! I'm not going! Say, what's that over there, it wouldn't be the philosopher? Spinoza has come for a dip! Let's make him do "the submarine". It's silly for friends to be formal, can I use the informal? Of course. I've been wanting to tell you something only all the formality got in the way. Now I can. Am I interrupting your chinwag? - You might say that. I didn't think you like sea-bathing. There are jellyfish and other things that touch you. Your room is so cosy... - You're right to tease him! Well, get back in the water, I'll show you how I can swim. Go on, we'll join you in a second. Pierre, come here! Fanny wants a spin in the pedalo. I've a better idea where I can place my foot! Come on then, if you're not scared.. You think I'm scared! I hardly meet Marcel before I have to leave him again. Therefore this evening, I've arranged to be free. Where's he taking you? - Nowhere. We'll talk at his. So I can spend the whole evening with him, I need to say we were together. Do you mind? Are you sure you aren't a little too trusting of Marcel? I've told you what I think of him. You know, I only got a brief introduction last night and he seemed quite a different type to yours, to your brothers. Pierre is like you. He doesn't like them. However it's just that that I like about him. There are boys who want to compromise you so they can blackmail you later. This invitation to his place should put you on guard. Against what? Against him, against his intentions. You don't know Marcel, but you know his intentions... I wish you'd give up this idea or go to the casino, to the beach, as much as you like but not to his place, I telling you. Listen, I asked you for a favour, not a lecture. Let's not discuss it further. Tell me you're not going tonight. I said I'd be there at 10pm. Oh, you won't understand until the day you know what it is to love someone. Then you'll see. "Love someone"? Love someone? Are you kidding?... Say... don't give that so much hammer, eh?! When you've knackered it, I'm the one has to pay for the repairs. Nice customers you have. I was asking you to let me take your record player upstairs. Again?! This time the bird's ripe for plucking. The time you've been working on this... Say, I'll get you some plastic flowers. The garden won't do. And only bring up champagne and sandwiches. Things like this give me an appetite. As for the record player... there'll be time enough when the lady gets here. But she won't be much longer, old sport. At her age, they don't yet think they have to arrive two hours late. Yes. Well... Suzy. - Good evening. You've come to see me? Any other day, I'd be delighted but this evening... I'm waiting for someone. - Yes, I know. She confided in you? Do you want a drink meantime? No need to bother, Lucienne's not coming. Why? Because I told her you phoned to cancel. You had the gall to do that?! Yes, I didn't want her meeting up with you. This is so great I don't know what to say. Marcel, I'm begging you, leave her alone. Just like that, to please you? Since you've had so many women, it shouldn't bother you. Yes, tarts... Tarts of your type. And now I'm about to strike it lucky with someone a bit classy so you have to stick your nose in, eh? I don't know what's stopping me from slapping you in the face. Try to understand, her and her brother are so nice. Not at all like you and me. You see, I put us in the same category. So what are you doing here? Are you ashamed perhaps? You've told these nice kids where you've come from? And what you've been doing there? They'll find out soon enough... What would you like? - Nothing. Buzz off. Meantime, you let them run around after you, eh? And you say to yourself: one never knows, maybe one of them will become so smitten he'll take me out of my situation. You think that's okay for you, but in my case it disgusts you! Yes, but what I'm doing can't cause any irreparable damage. You sound like a priest. As for your Lucienne, she knows very well what she risks. And she wants it anyway. Well, it might as well be me that benefits. And we'll see later what we can get out of daddy. Suppose I tell him who you are?... And if I spoke to him, I'd gave him some good advice. No, listen to me... since we're both hunting for the same thing, the only way we can get along is if we both keep our mouths shut. Is this enough sandwiches? Put all that back in the fridge! Then... the bird will not be plucked? Buzz off! A pact of silence, that's the best I can offer you. This way we can remain good friends. Didn't I already tell you not to give the machine such hammer?! Say, you don't recognise him? It's Barnave. - Barnave? The cop from Special Branch? I'll have a word or two with him. So you like this machine? It's fascinating. It's not coin-operated, you know. I see, I see. Therefore there's no point in you wasting your time watching it. Is that your car out front? Yes, why? You want to see the documents? I'll take your word for it. You know, I met a colleague of yours this afternoon. A colleague? Victor. Victor the skinhead. - He's here? In the area. He's very keen to encounter you, apparently. There must be a score to settle. Let him come... if he dares. He very well might. Mind if I continue my little game? He told you something bothersome? I've had better evenings, you can believe that! Now that we're in agreement, you can go. I've more to think about than your tales of woe. So long, good night. Freddy... Good night. ... I'm going to need you. You know Victor? Suzanne, why are you so late back? I've been waiting an hour and was wondering what could've kept you. Why were you waiting for me? I was worried that something had happened to you. And you were concerned on my behalf? All day I've been trying to see you and all the time others kept getting in the way. So this evening I vowed to act like them and I saw you disappear. I'm not used to people being so concerned about me. For an hour, I thought I was very unhappy. You're going to give me another ticking-off? Oh no. No, because now... ... now I realise it was wonderful. Look, someone's returning. It's Jean coming back from the casino. Just my luck! For once when I could have you to myself... No need to attract his attention. He might notice us in passing. Follow me, don't make a sound. He hasn't seen us. - No. And what if it'd been André, would you have agreed to hide too? Of course. So... why are you always leaving me alone to go with them? It's fun playing the coquette sometimes. Maybe I'm feeling a bit sorry for myself. In a bad way or in a good way? Jean... - Not asleep? No. I want a word with you. - You're looking very stern! I have the appropriate look to deal with someone of your type. I'm sorry if someone's pulled a prank on you but I swear it wasn't me. Okay, okay... You think that I don't understand that you took Suzanne out this evening? Oh, my dear old thing, she had a whale of a time. Yes, but I didn't. And from now on, I'm not leaving her side. I have exactly the same intention. Don't your realise your wasting your time with her? With your scrap metal and old tyres, it was bound to be. How do you know that? - Everyone knows. And everyone's laughing. Meanwhile you, with your boat with its ass in the sand is poetic and seductive, eh? You followed me, eh? - The whole boarding house is laughing. AS for Suzanne, well... - I'm sorry, Suzanne is in love with me. With me! - With me! I thought my story about school would amuse you. But you know, today I didn't visit him. And because of me, he was deprived his bottle of wine. Tomorrow I want you to take him champagne. And you'll come with me? He'll hate my guts. - Oh no. Plus... Plus? I'd like so much for him to see us together. I promise. Hello, student Moreau. - Hello, Mr. Pierre. Who's this? - The spitting image of a dunce. I see Mr. Bellemain's sleeping. - Don't wake him up. It's time for my lesson. Like Sleeping Beauty. Put the basket here. This way, when he wakes up, he'll think there's been a miracle. He'll know I'm here. Come, have a quick look at my favourite classroom. This is not a place about which I have a very clear conscience. You were a bad pupil? I spent my time infuriating the teacher. Really? Fractions, the metric system... I hated all that. So, to keep myself amused, I used to put carbide in the ink wells. We've all done it. Or firing paper pellets at the blackboard. If that's how you felt... Here I wouldn't have dared. Because it had to be not allowed to be fun? No, it's too nice, too neat. My school stank of dirty children. Everything was grimy... the classrooms, the stairs, the playground... Your childhood wasn't easy? Not very, no. Whereas here, it must be easy to apply yourself, to a good little girl in her clean uniform who listens and sticks her tongue out when writing. We aren't that old. No, but being again at the moment where nothing is decided, where things could work out with a little luck. How can you say that we don't have any? Is this how you study the Pragmatic Sanction? Shush! They're here. - Who is? Pierre with a lady. She's started to cry... And he... Oh, he's kissing her! Will you come down! - No. Pupil Moreau, I order you to obey me! Well, she's no longer crying. Did you hear me?! - I heard you but I don't give a damn. Oh, he's off again. I'll give you two hours' detention. I'll give you four! I'm going to get you down off your pedestal. Oh, she's run off and he's run after her. You'll break your neck, it'll serve you right. I'm coming down anyway, they've gone. You little bastard. If you ever do something like this again... Is she pretty? I thought so. A brunette. That should tell you how attractive she is because I prefer blondes Come and see, they must be crossing the playground. They look good together... Thanks! They didn't hear you. That's the way it is with lovers. Pupil Moreau, have you drunk champagne? Where would I have done that? But I ought to tell you one thing, I haven't a clue about the Pragmatic Sanction. Today it doesn't matter. Here, get the glasses. If I had nothing more to teach you, you'd leave like him. Your first glass of champagne. You'll remember it forever, laddie. It was with François Bellemain that you drank it. Little dunce... In case you get a call from Victor, it's for me, okay. - Yes, sir. Really? You don't have to be home at a set hour this evening? I wanted to be free because tomorrow my father arrives. And it's tougher to ask him than Aunt Louise. So this is what we'll do, firstly we'll have a relaxing dinner without rushing and then we'll go upstairs. I'm the shy sort... and all the nice things I feel, that I'd like to tell you about, I could never get them out in front of all these people. Is the champagne well chilled? It's been in the fridge for ages. Yes, but less of the cheek and concentrate on the service. Is this small parcel a surprise for me? It's a pocket square for a friend, tomorrow's her saint's day. A pocket square? Well, perhaps it would suit me. Oh no, it's embroidered, tomorrow is Saint Suzanne's. And you give gifts to that girl? Apart from a few strange ideas she has, she's very nice. If I was you, I'd steer clear of her, you know. Why's that? One never knows. In the holidays... Here, let me. ... they're are lots of people mooching about and you don't know where they came from. Well, that's your business. For the price they charge for their caviar, they don't give much. Good evening. Good evening, Victor. Is he there? - Yes. With a brat. He'll be pleased to see us. Come on, no time like the present. And your Suzy... If you want to know about her... Good evening, Marcel. Good evening. And what do you want from me? Well, if possible, to put our affairs in order and to do so without a fight. I've never had someone sit at my table without an introduction. Oh excuse me... Victor. Victor the skinhead. - You might at least doff your hat! I'm afraid of draughts, thanks. Marcel, you want to tell him to go? - She has a point, it's not polite. Why didn't you tell me it's that cheapskate caviar?! What a gross sort! You used to train them better than this! For the last time, will you... - Oh no, give it a rest, won't you? Nobody's talking to you. Can it. I'm talking to sir here. Say you... ...you have no right to instal those machines here. This area is mine, I paid for it. Therefore it's quite simple, give me 5000 smackers or Albert screws it up. You dig? The machines belong to me and nobody's going to touch them. Come on, don't play the fool... This is my turf we're talking about. Are you giving me the five big ones... or does Albert do his thing? And you know him, eh... he's an expert. And do you suppose I just happen to have the 5,000 on me? Right... Please, sir, stand back, because of the glass shards. Well? You coughing up? I'll give you 500. Go ahead, Albert. Hey, are you crazy?! Hello? The police? This is Freddy's bar. Poor Lucienne, what's up? What happened to you? You had to go to Marcel and do something stupid. They fought like thugs. The police showed up, the officers took them away. And your dress is all torn. Are you injured? - No. You should have seen what happened, it was awful! Calm down, it's over now. They asked for my papers, obviously I didn't have them. The officer said it was serious. He mentioned an investigation, giving testimony. And my father arrives tomorrow... Instead of giving your name, you should've given mine. It doesn't matter to me, I'm unattached. Suzanne... - Is that what you did? I'll tell the truth tomorrow, I swear. But this evening, I don't know what came over me. Don't cry, Lucienne. Don't cry like this, come on. I said you did the right thing. With all your questions, I'm watering all wrong and getting my feet wet. Besides, people who are nosy don't appeal to me. Inspector Barnave. You want proof? The police at the château?! You realise this place belongs to a baroness? So what? - What's she done, Ms Michelet? I don't like nosy people either. Tell her I want to speak with her. But what you're saying is ridiculous. I'm telling you, they're avoiding me like they know something. But what is it you think they know? Even Pierre is different. This morning, they were talking and when I approached, they suddenly fell silent. It's your imagination. Maybe there was something in the newspapers?... Ms Michelet, someone's asking for you in the garden. Coming. - Who is it? - One of the policemen. Are you in a good mood? - No. Do you want to make 10F? - Yes. Lend us your carriage. We're going to town, we'll be back in an hour. You must give me your word that this time there'll be no chariot racing. Word of honour. Come on, hitch it up. And my 10F? Here they are. Go on Jean, go and find Lucienne. - Oui. You asked for me? I'm checking the address you gave last night. As you can see... Have you pulled yourself together? I had absolutely nothing to do with it, they fought without me knowing why. There's nothing I can tell you. And your friend, might she have more of an idea? What friend? - Ms Lucienne Noblet. She's asleep in her room. - You're taking me for a fool. If you enjoy being noble, good luck to you but we know very well who was dining with Marcel. Look, my friend was asleep... - Yes, very well. You tell her the police are not without tact. We won't question Gaston Noblet's daughter about what she was doing at Freddy's bar. Why are you here though? I'm simply taking a break. It's no skin off my nose, but this isn't the place for you. Therefore watch yourself, you've been noticed. It's never a good idea to get ideas above your station. Get me? Treat Toby well, eh? - We'll give him some sugar. I'd love to come for a drive. The gang's all here. Come on, guys. This stick-in-the-mud didn't want to come. This really isn't nice... If Suzanne asks where we've gone, say you don't know. You shouldn't judge people too quick. Hurry up, she could be here any minute. What have they got against Suzanne? She's talking with someone they don't like. Pardon me madam, you haven't seen Lucienne, have you? No. But she told me to meet up here. They never tell me where they're going, what they're doing. And as to what's happened, I'm left to work it out. There's no point looking for them, they've all left. Even Lucienne? - Of course. Pierre told Raymond not to tell you. You can see how much you can count on their friendship. And on yours... - They're always like this. If you have the misfortune to talk with someone they dislike, they no longer want to know you. Hurry up, it takes time to hang up the lanterns. Okay, I'm off to the baker for the cake. Pick me up on the way back, okay? - Sure. This one's the most attractive. 500F? You won't have a sou left for your holiday? I want to give her a splendid gift but I'm 100F short. Here, I'll give it to you. - Thanks. With our firecrackers and 3 sparklers, André and I are going to look crummy. Yes, but I want to give her something that will endure. Come on, are we going? - Yes, let's go. Come on, move it. TODAY IS SAINT SUZANNE What are you up to? As you can see, I'm leaving. They've organised it so I realise I'm no longer welcome here. Yes but before you close your suitcase, come with me. The boys want to talk to you. Yes, come on. You'll see... But what for? It's not worth it... You can relax, it won't fall down again. Fine. Thank you Raymond, thank you. Look out, here they come! Long live Saint Suzanne! Long live Saint Suzanne! You see, Suzanne my girl, we wanted to celebrate your name day. This is for me? And this is just the beginning. We'll go from surprise to surprise. This is your place. And these are your gifts. The clip is from me. The bag is from me. I thought a blue necklace would suit you. The compact is my gift. And this is so you won't be late when your friends are waiting. Nothing like this has ever happened to me before. It's foolish... - You'll make me cry too. Hey you two, it's not my funeral! Always the same, those two. I at least owed him that, eh? Okay, silence please! The menu: For starters, Cinzano glacé... With vinegar. I think we're even. ... consommé, lobster, roast chicken, champagne, courtesy of the Baroness Saint-Leu. Hold on, hold on... And to conclude: a surprise cake. Go on, get started. So, is that champagne coming? - Ah, if you're thirsty... You'll understand if I don't trust you. I want real champagne. Champagne! Champagne! Mr. Noblet. - Hello, Raymond. Take all this to my bedroom. Are the children here? - That's who you can hear. I'll alert them. Mr. Noblet, nobody informed me of your arrival. I just got out of the car. So Pierre, you going to cut the cake? 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. Mr. Noblet has arrived. It's about time. Come on, children. - Excuse us. Here are the children. - Did you have a good trip? - Yes. A bit tiring, I should add. Daddy. - Good evening, my boy. Good to see you. You're looking well! We thought you'd forgotten us. Business, my lad. You'll find out what it's like. Good evening, uncle. - You shouldn't have got up. You were at table? - Yes. - Good evening, Gaston. Didn't I tell you this is a good house? Yes, look at everything they got me. This... this... And this. Everyone enjoys seeing you happy. I'm sure you'll like her. Just in time for the toast. Maybe you could say a few words?... I'm worn out... What do you want me to say? Ah, you have the knack of knowing how to improvise! Come on! Come on! - What do you want me to say? Daddy, may I introduce my friend Suzanne Michelet? They weren't lying when they said you were charming. Thank you. - Your place is over there. Here, uncle, next to me. You have a speech? - Speech! Come on, uncle. My dear children, the joy of seeing you again is mixed with the pleasure of seeing you feting a friend and making a sacrifice for the most touching feeling there is. I add my best wishes to all yours. - Well said! Three cheers for uncle Gaston! 1...2...3. You're all very kind but the journey has left me exhausted and I hope you won't mind if I take a well-deserved rest. Nothing to eat, daddy? - A drink, uncle? No thanks, I dined en route. Good night, daddy. - Good night, uncle. - Good night, children. Hey there, the dancing has begun. May I have the first dance? Hey, will you mind the record player? I want a word with my uncle. Is your business going well? Yes, providing I keep a constant eye on it. It was about time you arrived. The holidays have cost more than I expected and I'm running out of money. I'll give you some tomorrow. Excuse me, I'm worn out. Good evening. - Good night. Uncle... - What do you want? I need you to get me out of a tricky situation. I started something that's flopped... a car graveyard. And I've taken on an employee who's threatening to make a scene. Charming... How much do you need? 600. - 600? Well, I promise you it tomorrow. It's cool having an uncle like you. Good night. - Good night. Uncle... - Here's one more! Something terrible's happened to me. - What? I found a boat but while making coffee, I set fire to the sails. Of course the owner is taking advantage... Okay... how much do you need? 900. - 900? Ah, it's good to be back with the family! You'll get it tomorrow. - Thank you, uncle. I was just saying to Jean, Uncle Gaston is amazing. That's nice of you. Only next time, keep that opinion to yourself. Good night, uncle. - Good night. Every time I ask you for a commitment, you shy away. By staying near you? By letting you take my hand? All those are the delights of an evening in the holidays. You had me hope for so much more. You think we could be happy for more than one evening, more than one hour? The happiness I want, Suzanne, is the happiness that lasts all my lifetime... ... all yours. My life... If you only knew what it amounts to. You know very little about me. And I want so much not to cause you any pain. Your young girls' secrets, the dramas they've seen... We'll laugh about them later, the two of us. See. It's something more in your honour. Look out, no need blow my feet off! I'm not in a mood for jokes. You're a little blue as well, eh? - Yes. I found her attractive. Come on, let's not miss the bouquet. It's our blessing on them. I don't want the night to keep us apart too long. Tomorrow I'll wake you very early... by throwing some gravel at your window. I'm waiting for it already. Good night. Good night. Well then Suzy... You've been doing well since the other evening? We parted in Montmartre, we meet again in the middle of a family celebration. And with Aunt Louise giving you little presents. I tell you it's most amusing. Why don't you laugh? Well, I'll do like them. Me too... I intend to celebrate Saint Suzanne. You've entered my bedroom against all custom telling yourself I'm the same kid who can't say anything. What if I call out regardless? You wouldn't persuade anyone that a man in your room frightened you. Especially such a nice gentleman. Everyone here has spoken to me so differently. As a result for a few days. I've felt like a young girl like the others. Come on... Come on, come close to me. Come close to me. You will be more comfortable telling me your tales of woe. It would have been kinder not to recognise me. Although I'm taking advantage somewhat, the others will remain none the wiser. I've deep feelings for one of them. Jealousy is not my forte. Pierre has been courting me somewhat. I suspected as much from the way he looked at you. Because they have their diplomas, they think the world's their oyster. Look, I know nothing gives me the right to be difficult but tonight, I'm begging you, please leave. There are many others in your place who would be very happy that I take an interest in them. I'm appealing to all your discretion, all your class. Tonight, leave me alone. It's not my habit to force anyone. If I leave you... will you show a little gratitude tomorrow? Yes, I promise you. Well, this way will be better, the journey was a bit tiring. Plus I will have courted you. And you'll see that when it comes to young girls of your sort... I understand them very well. Good night, Suzy. Good night. Up already? With your suitcases? Can you take me to the station immediately? You're going? Without informing anyone? Without saying goodbye? Here, this envelope contains enough to pay my bill. Be so kind as to give it to Mrs. Saint-Leu. But what's going on with you? - Oh nothing, my break is over. Like that, so suddenly? And the others, when they ask where you are, what should I say? - Simply that I've gone. 1... 2... What is it? - It's me, Pierre. Come in. And take good note. I do this at 8am every morning! It keeps you in shape... and allows you at 53 to arrive at the office refreshed and ready to go. Your early morning visit, your embarrassed look, this is going to cost me 1000F for sure. Dad, I'm not here on the scrounge but to discuss with you something very important... that doesn't sit well with those exercises. Go ahead, I can hear just fine. Dad, I'm in love. With that Ms Michelet you saw yesterday. I believe she is too. I'm out of breath. You exercised too violently. My exercises have nothing to do with it. That you want to marry is crazy enough, but marrying that doll would be sheer bloody lunacy. But dad, I've just told you how much she means to me... It's Suzy who's put this idea in your head. But Suzanne doesn't know that I wanted to speak with you. Listen, lad... I don't want to hurt your feelings but... go find your Suzy... repeat our talk to her and you'll see if this marriage is sensible. Pierre, Suzy's gone. - What! Raymond drove her to the station. She's left no note of explanation. It can't be! What does this mean? What's going on? What the heck is this all about? Father, do you understand this? Young man... what is there for me to understand? Tomorrow morning at 8am. Good evening, sir. Good weather for the reopening. - Indeed. Say, that old geezer who just came in, isn't he the one from closing night? Oh, I couldn't stand him! Hey, instead of making wisecracks why don't you entertain the customers? Okay, okay... we're going. Are you looking for someone? - I want to see Ms. Suzy. Suzy's in the changing room. However until she comes back, how about a little drinky? I'm looking for Ms. Suzy. - Well, keep looking! Come on, Mado. [inaudible] he has a crush... Say, she's got guts, Suzy, he's no oil painting that one! Good evening, sir. Would sir like a table? Over here, sir will be fine. This is a nice table. Go on, scram! Send Suzy to me. She must be in the gaming room, sir. Send for her on behalf of Mr. Noblet. Very good, sir. Hey, Fréhel, it's your spot shortly. Yes, well, that's not going to recoop my losses. Tell Mr. de Lormel place n°1 is free. Mr de Lormel, a place is free at No.1. Oh no thanks, not for me. You're not playing anymore? I haven't touched a card since the holidays. You weren't here. Do you realise, Suzy, how much I've missed you? Yes, so I've got an idea... we could go on a trip together. A long trip. Something like round the world. But I can't. Do realise, Suzy, that I'm speaking only as a friend. Simply a friend. - Yes, I know, of course. And in one of those countries where nobody knows your past, maybe you'll meet someone... younger than me... less frivolous... who you'll like. I want to get you out of here. You see Suzy, I've reached a certain age and... one gets an occasional hankering to do a good deed. I couldn't ask for more than to get out of this wretched place. Well then? Although I well know I'll never see again the one I pine for, I don't want it to be my fault if he can't find me again. Suzy, you're requested downstairs, at the dancing. A certain Mr. Noblet. Mr. Noblet... Is it him? I hope I haven't interrupted anything? - No, not at all. After you left, Pierre confided in me and Lucienne told me about all you did for her. All this has changed the idea I had of you. Because... I'm a reasonable father... who wants his children's happiness above all. It was excellent you left of your own accord and that you'd realised you couldn't become part of my family. Therefore... you deserve that I take care of you and I want to take you out of this milieu where you're not respected. Suzy... I've retained for you... an apartment in a respectable neighbourhood. I'll come to see you two or three times a week. Since my wife died, there is in my heart a small corner... that remains empty. And it would make me happy to pamper a young girl like you. So deserving... with beautiful blue eyes... and the small breasts one has fantasies about. I bet you don't wear a bra. Little bitch! Have you gone mad?! Go on, get out of there! May I? You really should choose your personnel more carefully. Management apologises, sir. My apologies. Go on, get out of here! I never want to see you here again! Miss is with me. But Mr. de Lormel, you didn't see... Miss is with me, which part of that didn't you understand?! Come on, stop shaking like that. You did the right thing, sweetie. Say, old pal... you don't mind if we pick up the pieces? Yes, it's her gift to you. Come on, baby, it's all over. Huh... It's all over? Give me a nice smile. It was my fault. I spoke to her in a way she couldn't understand. We understand you. Your little hands are very cute. Are you offering us a drink? If it's not too much trouble for you to keep company with a lonely man who hates going home to a large deserted apartment. Loneliness, it's a ailment we can cure. Eh, Mado? So, little girl, this great trip... is it something you want to do? #... Never the hope of another night # # Hello, good night, goodbye love # # No future, nothing that endures # # This is my life forever more ~
