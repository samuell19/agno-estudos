Doctor ... I can't stand it. I'm having the nightmares again. You've got to do something. All right. Let's talk about it. Maybe that will help. It's a graveyard. A girl is putting flowers on her grandfather's grave. I'm driving home. I pass the graveyard, and I see the girl. For some reason I can't help myself. I turn around and go back. I climb out of the truck, and stand stiffly, like a robot, at the cemetery entrance. As I'm walking closer, suddenly I realise why I'm here. It's the Abomination! He's controlling me. He's hungry, and I must get him food. This - this 'abomination' ... Is that a person? A spirit? A voice in your mind? Or what? It's a demon. You know, from the prophecy in 'Daniel', in the Bible. It's a hideous demon from Hell! I see. I'm not much of a Bible scholar. Tell me more about it. Over 5000 years ago, the prophet Daniel foretold the coming... of the abomination that makes all things desolate. And then Saint John again warned of what's coming, in the Book of Revelation. And you take these passages in the Bible ... ... to refer to a demon that forces you to kill people? You think I'm crazy! Not at all. Please continue. In the dream, I chase the girl out of the cemetery... because I cannot kill her on holy ground. Something hidden in my pick-up truck is taunting me, begging for the girl's blood. We run on and on through the fields. I can smell her fear. My own heart is pounding. The only thought in my mind is that I must kill her. After a while, I lose sight of her. I'm furious, thinking that she has escaped me. There is no escape from the abomination. - So you cut her throat? - Yes. Please go on. I drive into town, finding myself at the car-wash. There is blood all over my truck. I know I have to wash it off. As the blood is washed away, my anxieties leave me. I'm no longer tense and afraid. I... I feel good about what has happened. The water runs off the truck, onto the pavement and into the drain. I know everything is all right. All my worries trickle down the drain with the blood. All right, Cody. Let's back up. You started this story in the graveyard. Isn't there more? What happened before that? Yeah. Okay. It all started when my mum began watching this phoney evangelist on TV. His name was Brother Fogg. And mum thought everything he said was pure gospel. I'll be teaching from the Book of Revelations. I'm talking about the Whore of Babylon. The mother of abominations, that will make everything desolate. This plague will be upon you very soon, so you'd better be listening. - Amen. - Woe unto those who have listened, and do not believe. Yes, Lord. In those days, there will be great mourning and gnashing of teeth. Men will bury themselves, and build great stones upon themselves ... ...and beg the Lord to die... ...but they will be unable to die. Amen. Now, you write to Brother Fogg, and say: "How can I get to Heaven?" Well, neighbour, you stand out ... One night I came home late from work. As usual, she was watching Brother Fogg. You're not listening to me. I'm trying to save you - and you're spitting in my face. I spend millions of dollars each year, bringing the programme to you... Mum, when you are going to stop watching that stuff? It's not good for you. - I was chosen for this purpose... - Mum, dammit, will you listen to me? A little religion would do you some good, young man. I'm sick and tired of hearing all these lies, night after night. This guy's a phoney. Mum, you know I've got nothing against religion. But all that guy wants is your money. He's going to beat you over the head, and enumerate your sins ... He doesn't care about you. - and drive you so hard down... - All he cares about is himself. - ... that you can't see the light of the day. Brother Fogg is a God-fearing man. But, Mum, I don't believe that for a second. The only thing that this man fears ... Oh, forget it! You're not listening to me, are you? - Now, the Whore of Babylon... - I give up! ... is the mistress of all plagues, and evil ... ... and all foul things that befall mankind. She is the mistress of all evil. Sound familiar? Well, I can assure you, that she is at work in the world today. Look around you. Everywhere you see people following the devil. Your dinner is on the stove. That's okay, mum. I'm going out with Kelly tonight. We're going to go see a movie. ... for selling their bodies... Can't you stay home with me tonight? I'm feeling extra poorly. Mum, I wish I could. But Kelly's expecting me. ... that hard-driving, sleep-inducing, jungle beast... Mum, there's nothing wrong with you. The doctor told you himself. Cody, there is a tumour in my lungs. - Brother Fogg told me so. - You're watching the Brother Fogg Ministry... ... and he gave me God's promise that I'd be cured. Mum, you need to get outside more. You need to see people. ... you are a very important part of Brother Fogg's Ministry. I mean, my friends don't even come around here any more. ...because you've gone over the edge on this Brother Fogg and his miracles. ... "Love Gift" of 20 dollars or more. Talk with God about it. Then send us your 20 dollar "Love Gift" ... to keep this vital Ministry alive. I was really worried. But it was no use trying to talk to her. She was convinced that her blessed Brother Fogg was God's present-day prophet. ... divine gifts granted by God himself... ...Brother Fogg will summon the powers that be, that will heal you. And now, we return you to Brother Fogg. Hi!! I'm Brother Fogg. Now I want each of you to put your hand on the television set. I see people out there with cancer, with spinal disorders... I would like for each of you to place your hand on the television... ...because I am going to heal you. This concludes another day of broadcasting ... ... on the Fogg Love Ministries Television Network. God bless you! Later that night, when I returned home, I noticed a foul odour in the kitchen. I didn't think much of it. I looked in on Mum, and she was sleeping peacefully. I was a little embarrassed. I had never done that before. I had been dreaming that something was choking me. As Mum fixed breakfast for me, she seemed perkier than I had seen her in months. She didn't tell me all that had gone on the night before. She just spoke vaguely about a wonderful thing that had happened. I thought it might have something to do with that Fogg character, so I didn't ask. I was just happy to see her in such a cheerful mood. Mum encouraged me to stay home in bed, and rest. But it was my day off, and I had plans with my girlfriend Kelly... ... and our friends Ike and Shawn. That pig was so good to us, we couldn't bear to eat him all at once! Listen, what are you guys doing this Saturday? Nothing. Well, I thought we could all, uh... go over to my place, and have some barbecue. Yeah - and one of your mum's sermons! Hey, I'm only kidding. Let's get going. - Bye, y'all. - You all be careful. He didn't mean anything, Cody. What's wrong? I'm worried about her. I knew I shouldn't have been so upset by Ike's remark, ... but I was worried that my mother's obsession with Brother Fogg... ... was turning her into an outcast. The following Monday at work, my boss Hiram was his usual charming self. What are you doing? I said hold it over there! - Like this? - No! Fuck! You fuckwad! I've bumped my head now, because of you! Get the hell away from there! Get! Arsehole! I'll do it myself. Now - go! Stupid! Although Mum had not told me about her tumour, she just had to tell somebody. While I was at work, she telephoned Doctor Russell. Hello. Is Doctor Russell in? This is Sarah Lee. Well, you tell him, last night I coughed out a tumour big enough to choke a horse. Yes. Of course. I'll bring it in tomorrow! Cody. Cody, thank God you're home, son. - Did you take out the trash this morning? - Huh? Yeah, of course. Then you must have seen it. It was right there on top of the bag. - What? - My tumour! Last night I coughed up a big tumour, just like Brother Fogg said I would. Now I can't find it. Cody Lee, don't you look at me that way! Mum, I think you need some rest or something. I'm very worried about you. I'm calling Doctor Russell. No, Cody, don't do that. Don't call the doctor. - Mum, I have to. - No, you don't. No you don't, Cody. Please. Don't do it. Mum, I'm calling the doctor for me! I've been coughing up blood. Don't call Doctor Russell. Call Brother Fogg. He helped me. Did he?? From what I can see, that damn Brother Fogg has done nothing but get you so confused ... ... that you don't know which way is up! Doctor Russell came to the house and examined me later that evening. Cough, please. Cody, did you know your mother called me today? No. What about? To inform me that Brother Fogg had healed her. Her tumour! That's why she didn't want me to call you. Doc, I'm worried. Will you speak with her? Certainly. Now what happened at work today? In the afternoon I began feeling uneasy. It seemed like something swimming around in my stomach. My head felt feverish. So I went back to the truck for a drink. Instead of helping, the beer made my stomach churn. I thought I was going to vomit. That's when I started spitting up blood. So you came directly home after that? Yeah. My considerate boss told me to go home before I made him sick to his stomach. - What's wrong with me? - It's too early to say... ... but I want you to stay home from work until we find out. Come on, Mum. Don't be this way. Please! Open up. Sorry, doc. I understand. Just keep me posted. Get plenty of rest. All right? Sure thing. Cody? Let me in, honey. Mum... Mum, just go away. I want... I want to be left alone! You sound terrible. I just want to help you. Cody, open up, honey! Cody, Ike's here to visit. Hi, chief. I hear you're not feeling too good. Why don't you open up, and let's take a look at you? Cody? Are you all right? Listen, Cody. I hope you're not still mad about the other day. I didn't mean anything. You know me and my big mouth. Hey, dude, are you still alive in there? Cody, answer us! Well, I guess he doesn't want to see me. Hey! I drove around for a long time, aimlessly at first ... ... and then suddenly I knew what I had to do. Cody! Come in. Ike's been worried about you. I'll call him, and let him know you're here. Well, it's about time! Cody, what in heaven's name is wrong with you, boy? You open up right now, do you hear me?! You open up right now or I'm going to get the hatchet and chop this door down. I mean it! What? Son ... where have you been? What's wrong? I just wanted to see you. - You've seen me! - How can you talk to me that way? If you don't like the way I'm talking, fine! I don't want to talk anyway. The next morning I remembered nothing about the night before. Mum was gone. She'd left some flowers and a note for me on the kitchen table. I was feeling much better. I fixed myself some breakfast, and sat down to eat. And then, I heard a noise from my bedroom. Everything I had done came flooding back into my brain. I thought my head would explode! When I stared at the pulsating tumour in the sink ... ... I knew I was no longer in control of my mind. The horrible thing living under my bed was using me ... ... to provide for it, and its offspring. Mrs. Lee, you can go in now. Please be brief. Brother Fogg is a very busy man. - How do you do? - Hello, Brother Fogg. I'm Sarah Lee. Two days ago, you healed me of a tumour. Yes, of course. Anyway, besides dropping by to thank you for the one miracle ... ... I'm here to ask your help on something else. How may I be of assistance? My son, Cody ... He's acting real peculiar all of a sudden. He stays out all hours. And he speaks to me in the rudest tone. Brother Fogg, I think he's ... possessed. And you would like me to exorcise the demon? - Could you? - Yes. Of course. Arrange a convenient time with my secretary, and I will be there without fail. Is there anything else? Yes. Here's a small offering. I wish it could be more. Well, thank you. Goodbye. 200 for a tumour... A full exorcism should bring 1000. Cody! What have you got there? ... bringing in the sheaves. We shall come rejoicing, bringing in the sheaves. Where are you going, mother? I know where you've been. You went to see Brother Fogg, didn't you? Fogg impregnated you with this thing, mother. What made you think he could help you get rid of it?? What are you talking about?! Brother Fogg planted the seed of this thing in you. You carried it... gave it life! You are the Whore of Babylon, mother! You are the mother of this abomination! Come out of him, devil! Come out of him! Oh, God... help me! Don't you love your baby, mother? He wants you, mother. He's hungry. Feed him! Oh, God ... help me! Hello? Cody? Mrs. Lee? I had a little gift prepared for Brother Fogg. But the gift would need food. Brother Fogg, are you all right? My new family was always hungry. They kept me very busy supplying them with enough food. - I thought you were sick. - I'm better. - Want a beer? - Hell, yes! The girl in the cemetery was just sitting there. It was too easy. ...abomination... I couldn't pass her by. ...abomination... I had never even seen her before, but the controlling voice in my mind told me ... ... she was destined for my knife. ... the abomination which makes us desolate ... desolate ... the abomination... the abomination... The abomination has always existed in one form or another. ...desolate... ...abomination... He is timeless. His evil spans eternity. ... The abomination which makes all things ... How can a power like that be resisted? ... The abomination - The abomination which makes all things desolate... The abomination which makes all things desolate... What's one human life, compared to the needs of an immortal being? ... The abomination - The abomination ...The abomination... The abomination... What difference would it make if the entire human race were sacrificed to feed him? ... makes all things desolate... The abomination... The abomination... This speck of dust we call a planet is only a microscopic fragment of his dominion. Universes have unfolded and collapsed ... ... serving no purpose other than to supply food for the abomination. ... The abomination which makes all things desolate... The abomination... which makes - I am satisfied to be a servant. ... The abomination which makes all things desolate... ... desolate...

I think he's ... possessed. - Oh, God ... help me. - What have you got there? I thought you were sick! Hello? Cody, are you there? Mrs. Lee! Hello? Cody! Let me in! Cody! Oh... God! - Cody. - Kelly, you shouldn't have come here. Why? Cody! What's wrong with you? I'm getting out of here! My stomach! Oh no! Oh no! No! God! No! No! God! No! No! No! This is quite an elaborate nightmare, Cody. What do you think it means? I don't know! It's just a bad dream. But I want it to stop. No, Cody, it's not just a meaningless dream. The reason you're here is that you're suspected of murdering 7 people. This dream is a way for your unconscious mind to explain the deaths ... ... and to externalise your feelings of guilt. You see, in the dream you die, and are punished for your sins. Even I play a part in the dream. Don't you see a lot of me in your Doctor Russell? No! Cody ... 7 people are dead. Did you kill them? No! It wasn't me! It was the abomination...!
