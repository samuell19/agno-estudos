Jermaine wants a beer. Thank you, honey bean. Where's mine, girl? Where's mine, my ass! Get your own. You wanna put some beer on that peach fuzz on top of your lip? Give yourself a real mustache? 13 years old, and working on his paunch. Trying to keep his pants from falling down. Screw y'all. Can't you just massage my foot? My little toe hurts. I can make more than just that little toe feel good. Girl! What the... Jermaine! Jermaine? Jermaine! Jermaine! I'm just saying, it's doable, man. Save money on rockets. So, people gonna climb these stairs to the moon? Man, I ain't say "stairs." They use compacted stuff. Junk, like whatcha-call-it. Landfill. Chunks of it, you know? Build one on top of the other. Man, you gonna be famous. A giant garbage tower to the moon? Charge admission. Y'all, y'all, pay Walter, pay Walter. Go to the moon. Wave down at your friends. Go yank yourself. You Walter byrd? Who wanna know? Walter byrd, you're under arrest for the murder of Jermaine Anderson. You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law. Hold still. You have the right to an attorney. If you can't afford an attorney, one will be appointed to you. Do you understand your rights as they're being read to you? What the hell? Allen, this is not a negotiation. He brings up the facts of the case, you say, "you have no case." Definitive remarks. Statements of fact. "You have no case." But it is a negotiation. You absolutely can do this. You just have to stay cool and say, "this is what the firm is willing to pay." Not, "our offer is..." We're not negotiating. We're telling them what's what. Where are you? I'm at county courthouse. I thought I heard a toilet flush. God. Just hold down the fort. I'll be back in an hour. Sarah Walsh, please report to the jury room. What if you get picked? No, they're never going to pick a lawyer. You know what's wrong with the American justice system? What? It depends on 12 people too stupid to get out of jury duty. Sarah Walsh, please report to the jury room... Okay, who's next? Name and occupation, please? Sarah Walsh. I'm an attorney. A fellow practitioner. Well, welcome to our little midst here, miss Walsh. I'm inclined to let you go, but can I first ask what area of the law are you currently engaged in? I am a corporate litigator. My firm represents a number of fast-food companies, protecting them from frivolous lawsuits by the bewildered and ignorant, people like your client. My friends call me the ardent defender of the French fry. I didn't know the French fry needed help. Let me make this easy for you. I believe the conventional wisdom that you don't want a lawyer on the jury, particularly me. I will be your worst nightmare. I will have undue influence. I know every nook and cranny of the law, so whatever crap you throw out in the courtroom, I will quickly undo in the jury room, and I'm very, very cynical about the legal system. God bless junk food. Also, I look askew on anything that smacks of you know, "the police were out to get me," which I'm guessing is the cornerstone of your case, given the comfort and familiarity in this environment that your client is currently displaying by doodling little boxes while his fate is being decided. Well, you are observant. Do you consider yourself a fair person? I believe that trials should be adjudicated solely on the facts presented, if that's what you mean. The public defender's office has no problem with this juror. Prosecution? No, I'm good with her. Your honor... Report to the jury room tomorrow morning at 8:00 A.M. Hey... Hi. What happened? Get off the couch. Um... They should get rid of jail time and just sentence criminals jury duty instead. Six years for robbery and 25 for murder. Just bore them into good citizenship. You're kidding me. They picked a lawyer for jury duty? I'm sorry. Afraid your bony butt gonna fall asleep? Ha ha. We arrived at the scene and found the victim, Jermaine Anderson, lying on the floor with a single gunshot to the forehead. An execution. - Objection. - Withdrawn. Ease, go on, officer. There were 15 people present, sir, but only the victim's sister, rakesha Anderson, got a real good look at the shooter, and she described him as an African-American male, in his early 20s. Height, around six feet, wearing air Jordans and a black hoodie. The jury should note that the defendant was arrested wearing the air Jordans, and the black hoodie was found at his house. Did the witness describe any other identifying marks? Yes, sir. She said he had a mouth full of bling. "Mouth full of bling." That's gold teeth, and does the defendant have a mouth full of bling? He does. One of his front teeth is gold. Very distinctive. Go on, please, officer. We investigated for about three weeks. Ultimately, we canvassed the neighborhood, and were told to go to 655 parkdale Avenue. 655 parkdale Avenue is in fact the residence of the defendant, Walter byrd. I just have one more question about this... bling. At what point did the witness notice that the shooter had gold teeth? Right after the shooting, sir. Right after the shooting... And what was the shooter doing to display these teeth? He was smiling. He was smiling. All yours. Did you find any fingerprints, any hair from Mr. Byrd's head, any fibers from his clothes at the crime scene? Anything at all that would link my client to the murder? No, sir. Have you found the gun that killed Mr. Anderson? No, sir. So it's one of those cases, is it? I don't know what you mean. Cases that don't have any forensic evidence, cases that depend on guesswork. Are you good at guessing, officer? How many jellybeans are in the jellybean jar, that sort of thing... Objection. The officer was not guessing at what clothes the assailant was wearing... My bad. Sorry, I was just... Thinking out loud, so to speak, trying to undizzy myself from the mere facts of the case. Kind of like half-rhymes. They sound like rhymes, but they ain't rhymes. A man happens to wear the same shoes as a suspect, and we might as well break out the pitchforks. Shall we ask the witness to step down so you can make a speech? I'm sorry, your honor. Officer runyon, how long have you been a major crimes detective? Seven years. Seven... And in those seven years, have you ever come across the name or the person Walter byrd? No, sir. Ever arrest him? No, sir. Never seen him in the company of known drug offenders? No, sir. Does the defendant have a criminal record of any kind? No, sir, the defendant has eluded the criminal justice system, until now. I'm sorry? I thought the defendant was innocent until proven guilty, not the other way around. According to the actual facts of this case, the defendant, Walter byrd, had no criminal record whatsoever until the day of the murder, at which point he walked into the home of a known drug dealer and shot him between the eyes. Is that unusual? Nothing's unusual in my line of work. Have you ever before in your career arrested a man in a drug execution with no prior criminal record? I don't recall, sir. Just what is your definition of unusual, officer? Can you state and spell your name for US, please? Rakesha Anderson. R-a-k-e-s-h-a a-n-d-e-r-s-o-n. Miss Anderson, how old are you? What school do you go to? I'm 15. I'm in the 10th grade at Evelyn mcmair secondary school. Nice. I need you to think back for a moment, and I need you to tell US everything you saw on the afternoon of the murder well, I was just hanging out at home with Kevin brown and my brothers Karson and Jermaine, and... This guy comes in with his homie, and one shoots Jermaine dead. I know that this is difficult for you, but I need you to tell US everything you remember about the men who murdered your brother. I only remember the one who killed Jermaine. He had on a black hoodie. Do you remember anything else about that particular gunman? He had on black and white air Jordans, mouth full of golds. You know Mr. Byrd, don't you? Yeah. He gotten into some bull with Jermaine a couple of years ago. Tried to cheat him in dice, and Jermaine set him straight. Do you see the man who shot your brother sitting in the courtroom here today? Yeah... Can you point to him, please? Him. He shot my brother, like he was a dog he was putting down. Please note that the witness pointed to the defendant. Thank you. All yours. Rakesha, you know the difference between what's true and what's pretend, right? Yeah, you real and Batman pretend. You ain't Batman, are you? I'm sorry, does this trial amuse you? No, you amuse me, sitting here defending him and acting like you all noble. On the day of the murder, you didn't tell police who killed your brother, did you? I was freaking, man. Jermaine was dead! The killer dude looked like he was from the 'hood, but I don't know who. His face came back to me when I saw him in the lineup a couple weeks later. It was like god tapped me on the shoulder. Does god wear a badge, rakesha? The police ain't tell me nothing! I see him! And when was the last time you saw Walter? I don't know. Was it possible that maybe he had come by earlier that day, let's just say to buy some drugs from Jermaine? Is it possible that that's when you saw him in a dark sweatshirt and white basketball shoes? I don't know. But it's possible? It's possible he Robin and you Batman? I would like to remind the witness that a man's life is at stake here. My brother's life has already been taken. This ain't no pretend. No further questions. You may step down. What you staring at? Why's he staring at me like that? The defendant is warned to refrain from threatening eye contact with any of the witnesses. Can you believe that god just reached down and touched that little girl on the shoulder? Th's how he works, in mysterious ways. You know, you could be driving down the road, working at a cash register, or making dinner, picking up the toys, and then he just pops in. Boom, there he is! Amazing! You know, we're not supposed to talk about the case. We weren't talking about the case. We were talking about the lord. I'll see you in there. Kevin brown, could you describe what the shooter looked like? Guy who shot Jermaine was real skinny, and short like me, but a grown-up. And how big are you? I'm 5'4", and I weigh 105. So you were with Walter the whole afternoon on the day that Jermaine was killed, from about 2:30 on? The whole time. We were just playing poker at my cousin Michael's apartment on magazine street. And how long were you at the house after the murder? Stuck around for about two hours. And the police never bothered to interview you? No, sir. Thank you. Do you think someone can kill someone and not look like a killer? I mean, we expect the stain of Cain, but what if some people can kill and then... Forget about it. Go home, eat some Froot Loops, smoke a fattie, watch leno. Have some fava beans with a nice chianti? Yeah, something like that. Is this about your trial? I can't talk about my trial. This is just an abstract question. Anyway, didn't we learn in law school that a guilty conscience is kind of irrelevant when it comes to criminal law? You know, just the facts, ma'am, just the facts. Facts are a little harder to evaluate when they go along with real people. Ain't that the truth. The defense would like to call Walter byrd to the stand. It's okay. Sorry... Don't worry about it. On the day of the murder, you went by the victim's house, didn't you? You're going to have to speak up, my friend. Yeah. And, why did you go by the house? My friend and I wanted to buy some weed from Jermaine. Two nicks... I mean, two $5 bags. Was it good marijuana? Objection. Goes toward motive, your honor. It's irrelevant. Move on. So you had no reason to be angry at Jermaine that day. Objection! Putting words in the witness's mouth. Sustained. Your honor? Move on, counselor. Prior to Jermaine's murder, how frequently did you go by his house to buy marijuana? Once in a while. A couple times a month. Do you know rakesha? Yeah, she's lived around the corner from me for a lot of years. I see her at the house. She's younger than me, but I say hi and stuff. So when the police first interviewed you, you denied seeing the victim that day, am I right? Yes, sir. Why is that? 'Cause buying weed is against the law. So you were afraid. Objection! Telling the witness what to say. Sustained. Were you afraid of the police? Yes, sir. Did you kill Jermaine? No, sir. In fact, you've never been arrested for any sort of crime whatsoever, am I right? Yes. Statistically, one in four men in your age group and your financial demographic is arrested and convicted of a crime by the age of 22. So if, as the prosecution contends, you are this professional criminal, an assassin, well, then, you must be the most cunni and elusive assassin in the history of mankind. Objection, your honor. These aren't questions, nor is there any evidence that the facts declaimed by Mr. Burston are true. Sustained. Please stop pontificating, Mr. Burston. You have a summation for that. Sorry, your honor. Where did you go after you left the victim's house? We went by Michael's house to play cards. So by 3:00 P.M., on the afternoon of the assassination you were at the home of Michael Johnson? Yes, sir. We was there by the start of the basketball game. No further questions. Do you know that marijuana is an illegal substance? Yeah, that's why I didn't want to tell the police about it. Do you know that lying to the police in an investigation is a felony? Your lawyer can't answer for you, son. Answer the question, please. I guess so. Now I do. Are you saying that you don't even have the moral sense to know that lying is wrong? You seem to engage in illegal activities rather casually, Mr. Byrd... Objection, your honor. Sustained. Since you're so casual with the truth when it suits you, how are we to know that you are telling the truth right now? Are you? Or are you just trying to pull a fast one on the court? I am telling the truth, sir. So you say. If in fact you can remember what the truth is with all the pot you smoke. Mr. Byrd, do you own a black hoodie? Yes, sir. Do you own black and white air Jordans? I do, sir. I would like to enter into evidence exhibit 26, black and white air Jordans. Exhibit 27, black hoodie. I have nothing further. Redirect, your honor. Are black and white air Jordans a popular shoe? Objection, your honor. Mr. Byrd is not an expert in shoe popularity. Do you know anyone that has black and white air Jordans? Yeah, lots of people have them. Lots of people... Defense rests. I know you. You're at hannon Fitzgerald. My firm, Galloway and johanson... We had the filgo case against you. Yeah, I remember that. We slaughtered you. We settled, actually, but, hey, it wasn't my money. Can you believe that they picked two lawyers for the same jury? Yeah, well, I guess they decided they needed someone with brains. Well, I think it's pretty cut and dry. The defendant was identified at the scene as the shooter. By his own admission, he was at the victim's house on the day of the murder. He claims to have been at a poker game at the exact hour of the murder, but only one member of that alleged game came forward, and he was not very convincing. I put two and two together and, personally, I get four. All those who vote guilty, raise your hands. 11 to convict. I think we're all eager to get home. Sarah? Set US free, baby. Not guilty. Come on, man... Kevin brown said the shooter wore a black hoodie, a mask, and gold in his teeth. Well, byrd's got that gold tooth. Yeah, but his mouth is hardly tricked out. Tricked out? Yeah, there's a difference between one gold tooth and many gold teeth, between a cavity and a mouth full of bling. Frankly, I don't know the kid, but I know what most teenage boys are like. Punks. That girl, what's her name, rakesha? She picked Walter out of a lineup. No, no, rakesha failed to I.D. Walter... A boy she clearly knew from her neighborhood... Until the police guided her to the photograph. She all but said that the cops told her who did it. I didn't hear her say that. I did hear her say that god told her he did it. Well, god is not a witness in this case. You sound like you're prejudiced against christians. I am not prejudiced against christians. I am fine with the father, the son, and the holy ghost. I just don't think that rakesha is some sort of Joan of arc who had a vision of her dead brother fingering Walter as his killer. Why, in a house full of people did no one else see any evil, hear any evil, and certainly won't identify any evil? 15 people were home. Only rakesha happened to see Walter? That's... That's just not believable. Well, I'm sure you live in a nice neighborhood, where people don't get shot every day. All right, so... Walter supposedly was smoking some weed, playing cards with his friends, but only his waste-case of a cousin shows up as an alibi witness. Where's the rest of the posse? Why aren't they down here testifying? I'll tell you why. Because they don't exist. It's not Walter byrd's job to prove his innocence. It's the government's job to prove his guilt. That's law school 101. Come on, give me a break. You know perfectly well that 90% of these people are guilty, they're just too stupid to take a plea. You are supposed to be a lawyer, not the leader of a lynch mob. That's uncalled for. That's my point! I mean, we're not debating the guilt or innocence of Walter byrd, champion pot smoker. We are just trying to ascertain if the government has proved its case beyond a reasonable doubt, which it hasn't. There is no gun. There is no physical evidence. There is no motive. I mean, all they have left is some skanky conflicting eyewitness testimony. Skanky? What, you sure's it's not skivvy, or gross, or hoochifying or... Um, I have something to say. I'm changing my vote. What? To "not guilty". What? So who do you think committed the murder, Sandra? Someone you wouldn't expect. Like his girlfriend. It's never the guy you think it is. So you're saying we should acquit him because the facts point to him being guilty? Not guilty. I have my reasonable doubts. I'm also switching my vote to not guilty. Aw, come on. - Seriously? - Seriously. Aw, hell... Judge, we're deadlocked. I'm going to poll the jury. All who vote guilty, raise your hands. Not guilty? Someone can't make up their mind? Reluctantly, I'll declare this a hung jury and conclude this trial. Court is dismissed. I'm mahalia robeson, Walter byrd's grandmother. I'm just trying to find out a little bit how the case played in the jury room. Don't ask me. I voted guilty. That's who you want. Rallied to your side like a damn junkyard dog. Thank you. Don't thank me. I just know how to follow the law. Come on. Hey, sweetie. Did you miss me? Okay, get off the bed... Hey. Hey. It's late. Just get home? Yes. It was endless. I was pounding my fist against a wall of stupidity. Did you win? Hung jury, because of me. I held out for not guilty. You stood up for an innocent guy. I don't know that for sure. I just know that the prosecution didn't prove its case. Yeah. Come here. Still... That boy. Who? Walter. The defendant. He had these... sleepy boy eyes, like he should still be in his pajamas. Like he didn't expect anything good in life to ever to happen to him, you know? It's sad. I'd like to propose a toast, to a very lucrative victory over Jones and painter, one of the biggest law firms in Chicago. Well done. Cheers. Juror number four. Hi. I saw you quoted in the paper. Apparently you prevented a miscarriage of justice. Sounds like you deserve a reward. I think a drink will do. I'm glad you stopped by. I want you on the anytime burger case, as first chair. Ooh, I like this. You take a week off of work and get a promotion. You've earned it, and this could be a history-making case. Plenty of opportunity for legal precedent. It's a massive class-action sexual discrimination lawsuit. A bunch of women charging hostile work environment. Promotions based on sexual favors. I'm sure there will be a lot of "he said, she said," and a very vigorous debate over the facts. That doesn't sound like the kind of case we usually do. A refill, ray? No, I'm fine, thank you. Sarah? No, thanks. Well, if you're not comfortable, I could offer it to Louise... Please. I'm ready for battle. Anytime burger, like all of our clients, deserves the best counsel that... money can buy, yeah. Yeah. Cheers. Cheers. I doubt that all those women suddenly developed group psychosis and decided to sue anytime burger. We haven't even done discovery yet, and besides, who knows what happened in the hallowed stalls of anytime burger? And besides, I'm not a sole practitioner like you. I'm a lawyer. I need to defend my firm's clients. Billable hours. Wasn't it you that just last week said you wanted to work less, not more? What about the procreation plan? Clock is ticking. Tempus fugit, baby. I love it when you talk dirty. Ms. Walsh? I'm mahalia robeson, Walter byrd's grandmother. Yeahi remember you from the courtroom. Well, I'm sorry to bother you, Ms. Walsh, but I need to talk to you. It's either a retrial or take the plea. Walter's gonna take the plea. I tried to talk him out of it, but the boy won't listen. How many years? 12. He'll be 33 when he gets out. Well, if he's innocent, he shouldn't take the plea. Walter couldn't kill anybody. He talks the talk, but Walter don't walk the walk. He's got a dog just like yours. Here he is with buddy. Loves that dog more than anything in the world. Walter's lived with me since he was six. My daughter, lashaun, took him out to California when he was three, but... Well, then she got into drugs and disappeared. The neighbors found Walter eating out of their garbage. He was sent to foster care, anit took me another six months to get him back. That's horrible. He smokes a lot of dope, that boy, and he doesn't know where he's going, but he's innocent, and he almost lost that trial, and if he loses another trial, his life is ruined. I'm a proud woman. Don't make me beg. Defend my boy. You don't understand. I've never done a murder trial. I'm not that kind of lawyer. I don't believe you're the kind of person to leave a bleeding man on the side of the road, or let an innocent man spend the rest of his life in jail. People should help other people. People should care. It's not about caring. It's about the law. Sarah? Where are you? I'm here, I'm in the kitchen. Whatcha doing? Thinking about your mom? I'm actually thinking about mahalia. This might sound strange, but she reminds me of my mother. You know, after my dad left, my mom had to work two jobs just to keep US going. She'd come home at night, make US dinner, help my sister and I with homework, and she'd then go back to the diner and work the late shift. She did whatever she could to take of her family, like mahalia. Nothing else mattered except for making sure her kids had a shot. Turned out well for me. Walter's not so lucky. Your mother would be proud of you. Would she? I wish she was here to say that. What if I take this case? The murder case? I think you should. Really? Yeah. I think it's good for US to remind ourselves that the law isn't just some abstract chess game, rigged in favor of those who can pay, the lucky ones that can actually afford fancy law firms like hannon Fitzgerald. I watch you, you know. When you're working late at night, I see thatook on your face. All you see is fatigue. Yeah? Maybe it's something else. Not that you'd cop to it. Well, that firm you malign, you know it pays for half of this house. Doesn't pay for half your soul. Come on, ray. Our firm has to up its pro bono quotient anyway. I want you to focus on anytime burger. I am focusing on anytime burger. We've got months of discovery ahead of US, and I'll just do this on the sidelines. You multi-task. A little law, a little golf, a little schmoozing with the governor, and look what you made. Well, do it fast. I'm okay with you helping the so-called disadvantaged as long as it doesn't interfere with our lucrative clients. Okay, you got it. Don burston has to stay on. I can't do it by myself. Thank you. Thank you! Hey, Don, this is Sarah Walsh. I'm looking at the Walter byrd files that you sent over, and the original police report don't seem to be here. Do you have them? Also, I wanted to see if you checked with rakesha to see if her story stayed consistent over time, and also, where are Walter's alibi witnesses? Do you remember me? I was a juror on your trial. I'm also an attorney. My name is Sarah Walsh. Your grandmother wants me to represent you. She and I don't think you should take a plea. I told my grandma this is pointless. I made up my mind. Guard! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Humor me for five minutes. Your grandmother thinks that you're innocent. I didn't kill Jermaine. All right, I'm going to ask you a few questions. It's not an interrogation. You can be completely frank. Honest. What was your real relationship with Jermaine? He scared the crap out of me. Jermaine was always mean, ever since we were kids. Rakesha's just trouble in a tube top. She just don't like me. Used to call me names when I walked by the house. I should have never gone over there. Why did you? 'Cause Jermaine had the best weed in town, and me and mackety Mac wanted some. You go out for a toke, and spend the rest of your life in jail? Mackety Mac is your friend? Where is he? Why are you asking me? I ain't seen him. I've been in here for eight months. Don't take a plea. I can fight this. Man... At least I know when I don't know nothing. Okay, look, I may not know anything about what it's like to be you, but I can help. If you let me. If you didn't do it, don't plead. I can't do 25 years in here. You won't have to. Trust me. I won't let you down. Well, no, no, no, I'm looking at it right now. Yeah... Impossible. I'm fine standing. I gotta go. All right. How do you, function like this? They say mess is the evidence of a creative mind. I know where everything is. You may see chaos. I see a pattern... Known only to me. You sure that you don't have a police report stuck somewhere under some moldy moo goo gai pan? As I said on the phone, had I'd gotten it from the district attorney, you'd have it in your hot little hand. Excuse me. Yeah. We're on our way. That's my private investigator. Why didn't you hire an investigator for Walter before? Quite frankly, I didn't think I needed one. The prosecution's case was so weak. You know, you really don't have to do all this investigating personally. We can handle it. When I do things, I like to do them right. You know, the first time. Well, let's just hope you don't screw up your pretty little record on Walter's account. This way. Derrick white, Sarah Walsh. She's the lawyer that's going to be helping US. - Hi. - Hello. I see the lady likes to be clean. Have you happened to look for the other members of the poker game that Walter was at when he was supposedly executing Jermaine? I like the phrasing. "Have you happened to look?" She speaks the queen's English. Makes her feel above the squalor, like she's sanitizing her words. He likes to speak to people in the third person. Makes him feel above his own bull. Okay. Of the potential poker witnesses, Michael Johnson is stationed in Germany. Clevon Joyce is in jail. That shreds his credibility. And I think leroi's got a lead on mackety Mac, though I'm not sure what we'll find there, since I hear Mac's been shooting up... Heroin, cocaine, anything he can get his hands on. What a fantastic witness. You want nice, shiny mbas, you got to practice in palm beach. Thank you. For what? For referring to me as "you". All right, then. Maybe you guys should stay in the car. Well, I don't think this particular neighborhood would benefit from my presence. No, I'm coming. I'm coming. Can't stop a cannonball. Don't take all day. All right, peace, y'all. Peace, peace, peace... Whoa, what the hell are you doing? What the hell are you doing? I'm just trying to cut to the chase and not waste time. Look, there's etiquette here. That's spider, our local drug kingpin. We'll get leroi killed, and ourselves, too, if we yank his chain, and I'd like to live to see lunch, so why don't you just watch and be cool. Look, can you just take your arm off me? Better they think you're my little snow-ho than a cop. Crap. Yo, leroi... Yeah? What's up, man? Derrick white. I'm helping Walter byrd. Are you crazy? Get away from me, man. You trying to get a bullet put in my head? Yo, man, I could just hand you a wad of cash right now and spider will think you're my bitch, or you can tell me real quick where mackety Mac is. Man, I ain't seen him since, like, last summer. I heard Mac was sucking the pipe big time. My cousin nolene saw Mac coming out of some crack house. Which one? Probably not the one you go to. Come on, man, which one? Lamont, crayber? Come on, man, you want me to help you out again? I don't know, man. North lawndale. That's where nolene lives. I think Mac's been staying out there. Cool, cool. All right, check it out. I'm going to yell at you like you screwed me over. Just go with it. Where's my money, man! Where's my money! Okay, whoa, whoa, whoa. Okay, honey, honey, hey, get off of him. Get off of him. Give me my money, man! I ain't playin' with you no more! Okay, hey, hey, come on, come on. Come on, now, let's go. Damn, girl, you got hand sanitizer all over me. So, what's the deal with spider? Homicidal thug. Word is that spider's the one that killed Jermaine because Jermaine was muscling in on his territory. Are you kidding me? Spider's the shooter? Thanks for the update. Can't prove it, of course, unless spider's homies turn state's evidence. Yeah, and I'm sure spider's posse will be lining up outside the d.A.'S office. Speaking of that, I have to get burston back to his office. I told you it was going to be hard. I mean, Jermaine's already dead. It's not like he's going to suddenly reincarnate, so what's the point of talking to the cops or US? Jermaine's crew is going to handle this original gangster style, you know? Pop-pop. But killing the real killer is not going to help Walter. Yeah... A-ha! Hold up. Derrick here. Seriously? Okay. What's the address? All right, thanks, man. I owe you. One of my contacts just saw mackety Mac. Well, let's go. Yeah. This is it? Crackhouse central. You coming in? I-I'll stay here. Suit yourself. Um M-my boyfriend just came in? Tall black guy. Hey. It might help if you had a picture of Mac's mug. That's him. Yup. He stinks... Spider's guys stopped by for a chat. Seemed a little cozier inside than outside. Aw, hell. Let's go. Y'all are going to have to move. This cat's heavy. Hey, yo, Derrick, I didn't know you were on the pipe. Me on by, spider set you up real good. You too, pretty lady. Vanilla Booty. You got good taste, brother. You know, we know that spider killed Jermaine. Hey! Tellpider, we ain't got no beef with him, all right? Just helping out Walter byrd. We all good. The ho down with that? I'll make her down. Cause spider got better things to do an deal with white lady lawyers sniffing around. Tell spider to go screw himself... Hey, get in the car. And spider knows just where to find this pretty lady. Where does she live at again? North shore. 1324 foxhill. Nice place. Hey, look, just tell spider we cool, all right? We got no beef. All right? We cool. This ain't no suicide mission. Kill yourself on your own time. Do you realize they know where you live? Spider is pathologically mean cocky, and just stupid enough to kill you. Look, I cannot go around with you unless you respect the rules of the streets. Now, they ain't codified in some law book, but they're real. I-I'm sorry. That was uncalled for. Derrick's law is my law? Don't forget it, snow-ho. We better get Mac to detox before he's past his expiration date. Come on, Mac, just hang in there. I will be there soon as I can, Allen. Yeah. Wait. What? Okay, just leave the depositions on my desk, and tell Fitzgerald that I'm on top of it. Okay. Hospital's happy to stop Mac from dying, but we need a family member's signature to actually check him into rehab. Well, then, what are we going to do? I just did not see that. What's there to see? Mackety Mac's pop has got a beautiful John hancock. Mac's going to thank US for this. Nobody wants to die because of red tape. What now? So you think you can mess with spider? You think your pretty white lawyer is gonna pin this murder on him? Hey, Mac. We've come to talk to you about Walter byrd. How is Walter? I ain't seen him in a long time. He still working at Pete's? He's been in prison for the last eight months. Holy crap, what did he do? The police have accused him of killing Jermaine Anderson. Walter? Man, he sees Jermaine, and he be whizzing in his boxers. Last time I saw Jermaine, I was buying some weed. I made Walter go in just to see his hand shake. Well, that's the day they say he shot Jermaine. Now, that's a crack dream. I was with wter that whole day. We went to a friend of leroi's and played cards. Would you be willing to testify in court at Walter's trial? Sure. I guess. They ain't gonna make it look like I killed Jermaine, right? No, no, no, this is about Walter. Mac, it's group. Let's go. I gotta go. Group therapy. Walter's innocent. I knew it. I wouldn't have wasted all this shoe leather if I thought he actually killed Jermaine. Yeah, but how can you be so sure? I mean, I thought so, but I don't... I can vibe people. Vibe people? Yeah, you can talk all you want in a court of law about reasonable doubt, but on the street, you got to be able to decide real quick who's gonna knife you in the alley, and who's just trying to scare you. I think being a lawyer has made my gut go haywire. Nah, your gut's always your gut. You're just better able to rationalize. Who did this to you? Who you think? Why you messing with spider? Because we think spider killed Jermaine. You don't get it, do you? Why you go getting that crazy hustler all pissed off? I should have never listened to you. I'm a dead man. We found Mac. He was in pretty bad shape but we got him into rehab, and I think he's going to be okay by the time we go to trial. Walter, I'm going to have you put in protective custody so that spider can't get you. I'm going to get you out of here. 15 of the anytime burger depositions are done. Two of them will work for US, but we'll probably have to go back a bit further, maybe two or three more years. You got any guide dogs inside the company? Somebody to show where the bodies are buried? Yes, a ferociously ugly little chatterbox who loves to trash-talk employees who don't meet... Her standards of sexual propriety. Finding Mac is good, but I'm worried it's not enough. Last time it was rakesha that destroyed US. I know she lost her brother and I feel bad for the girl, but I can't help but feeling that she's got some bad blood going towards Walter. You know, something. I just can't believe it's an honest mistake. Hey, I gotta go. Finish that case, soon. I need your full attention on the clients who pay our bills. Did I miss her? Perfect timing. Looks like she's, just headed home. All right, well, let's see if your fabled charm can get her talking. Hey, rakesha... Yeah? Hey. We want to talk to you about Walter byrd. I know it must be really hard to talk about what happened, but we're just trying to figure out if the police had anything to do with it. Wh. I'm confused. Do you think the police killed Jermaine? No, no, no, um... I just think that the police are happy to put some black guy in jail and call it a day. I don't think they're too particular about which black guy it is. Was it the police that first gave you Walter's name? Help you out when your memory got a little fuzzy? Look, word on the street is that spider killed Jermaine. It was a turf war. Is that what they say? And you know Jermaine's homies ain't gonna just sit back and forget it. They're gonna pay back that murder. I don't know anything about that. Walter byrd could spend the rest of his life in prison for a crime he didn't commit. Does that seem fair to you? Well, is it fair that two of my brothers have been killed? Is it fair that my grandma's out there looking for work now that Jermaine is gone? She's 72. Is it fair that I was born piss poor? Do you know what that's like, lady? I bet you don't. I have one thing to say to you. I saw Walter byrd kill my brother. That's what I saw. You may not like it, but those them facts. Wow, that went well. Let's hope Mac's a good witness. Mac? Are you in there? You have visitors. Go in. Mac? Mac? Mac! You open this door! Now! Excuse me. Okay. I've goto go get help. I'm just so arrogant! I shot my big mouth off and now I don't know if I can deliver. You know, "don't worry, Walter. I'll get you off." I mean! I should neverave been so cavalier with someone's life! Sweetie, they're the ones that asked you to take on the case. You're working like a maniac. There's not much else you can do. This is Walter's life, not some theory of copyright law that a bunch of lawyers are batting around. I'm sorry, I didn't realize you thought protecting intellectual property was such a waste of time. No... I'm sorry. I didn't mean that. I'm just... I'm overwhelmed, and I can't believe that mackety Mac is dead. Baby, he was a junkie. You shoot heroin every day, it's not going to end well. I know, I just... I just thought that he could... He could stay clean and help Walter. Now, I just... I don't know what to do. Our first preliminary hearings are tomorrow. Look, I think you need to give your brain a break. Get some sleep. Stop the whirring, you know? Get up in the morning, look at it again, see if there's anything you missed. Frankly, I'd just do what every other defense attorney seems to be doing these days. Attack the system? Exactly. Look for prosecutorial misconduct, sloppy police work, legal technicalities if you have to. Well, this is Chicago, the nation's capital of corruption, or at least one of them. Walter's innocent, right? The truth is out there. This is ridiculous, judge. Ms. Walsh was a juror on the last trial. She cannot be Mr. Byrd's defense lawyer in this one. She needs to recuse herself on ethical grounds. And those grounds are? Illinois ethics rule 3.6. Ms. Walsh gave an interview by the sun-times about the verdict. Lawyers are barred from publicizing information that may prejudice a trial. Your honor, Ms. Walsh was not functioning as a lawyer then. She was simply a juror at the first trial. You do not remove your cloak as an officer of the court when you step into the jury box, your honor. Leave your briefs with me, and I'll review them. Well, I can't imagine that gambit's going to work. It's like legal gobbledygook, d I told the damn reporter I voted not guilty. Since when is that privileged information? Well, they'll try anything, but I'm confident we'll prevail, but this dispute will set US back a couple of weeks. The American justice system moves along like a pile of gelatinous goo. Well, we could use the time to devise a new strategy, and I have to focus on my paying job. What's wrong? French fry in trouble? A trans-fat attack. Walter's going to have to be patient. He doesn't seem to have much of a choice, does he? Poor Mac. He was a bright kid. Talked about being doctor before he started juicing. Well, his death doesn't help Walter. I don't know what to do next. Man, those Andersons are a bad bunch. What do you lawyers call it? A criminal enterprise, that whole family. You know, after Jermaine got shot, the police were over there every day for weeks looking for iden. Bet you that's it. What do you mean? That little girl, rakesha, she's been sent to work the cops. She helps them clear the case, the less reason they have to go poking around her family. Well, it makes life easier. You just throw the book at anyone who fits the bill and call it a day. Something like that. Derrick got any sources inside? Derrick was military police, in Iraq. Well, that's not going to help. Well... I know someone, though... Someone who may be able to help. Did you tell him we were coming? Of course I did. This is so typical of him. I call him, and we come all the way out here to his cabin, and he's not here. Well, Vincent is reliable. Once an s.O.B., always an s.O.B. You know, he never paid child support. He never sent me a birthday card. He never even called me when mom died. It's like he didn't even care about someone he was married to for seven years. Well, you can't expect much from him. I know, I know. I don't. He's just unfortunately the only cop... Or ex-cop... At I know. Sarah! I didn't know you were coming. Vincent, did you know your daughter was going to visit US today? I forgot. You've got to remember to tell me these things. Hi, dad. Hi. You two look well. We haven't seen in you in what, two years? Life's agreeing with you? Sarah... You gonna give your dad some grandkids? We're working on it. Dad, where are you going? I've got to take bear for a walk. 'S bn cooped up all day, so... I'll come with you. Come on, I'll make US some coffee. So, how you been? So dad, I took on this murder case. I always thought corporations were greedy. I never knew they'd started killing people. Yeah... No, they're just happy to make 'em fat. It's a pro bono case I took on, a kid accused of murder, in Austin-gresham. That's a rough neighborhood. Well, he's probably guilty of something. No, I really think my client's innocent. Yeah, what you don't know, you don't know. Dad, if the police records were misplaced, at would happen to them, would they be destroyed? Dad? I heard you. Now, why are you bothering with some drug dealer shooting another drug dealer? I mean, that's the good news, cleaning out the neighborhood. My client is not a drug dealer. You know that for a fact? Look, dad, let's just cut the crap here, okay? I came to you to ask you about the inner workings of the police. Either help me or don't help me, but don't jerk me around and then bail. All right, who's the cop? Runyon. Harry runyon. Don't know him. Are you sure? No. Go to hell. Okay, wait. Sarah, come on. Sit down. Come on, sit down. Cops almost never actually destroy anything. All right? "Obstruction of justice," "destroying evidence," all that legal crap, but things get lost all the time, and they're usually close by. Very close by. You know, an old filing cabinet, the bowels of thevidence room, jammed into the wrong case file. Anything easy. Good to know the police are doing their jobs. Hey, there's a lot of sewage out there, Sarah, and cops, most of them good honest men, are doing the best they can to clean it up as fast as they can. Now, you may like this client of yours, but I'll tell you what, 99% of them are animals, and if he hasn't committed this exact same crime, then he's done something just like it or worse. That's not the point. Rough justice just isn't good enough. Yeah, but it's better than the wolves overrunning the city. Thank you. "Sarah, I hear key evidence is missing "from a couple of these cases. Dad." Vincent, you never fail to amaze me. My source sent an itemized list of all the cases that runyon's worked in the last five years. Apparently, he has a pattern of, quote unquote, "losing information that might be helpful to the defense." Well, it's not unusual to find a Chicago cop that stinks, but then finding the srce of any odor is just so damn tricky. Wow, corporate law. I guess there's, money in that. I had a friend of mine who worked in the archives of the courthouse. I had her up all night xeroxing copies of the court files from all of runyon's cases. Is that the only thing you guys xeroxed? Well, the rest wasn't g-rated. Well, at least there was some fun to be had. Okay, I'm going to call in sick, and we're going to spend the next 24 hours calling every defense lawyer here to see if any of their cases went suspiciously south, which I'm sure they did, and then we're going to get affidavits from them. And then climb mt. Everest, swim the English channel, and bicycle backwards down rush street. Unicycle. Unicycle backwards, with your friend from the courthouse on your shoulders. These documents have a strange way of disappearing... Did you work on the alamita Jones case? I can't tell if the police department is a hotbed of willful malfeasance or just a well of stupidity. Personally, I never underestimate stupidity... Okay, listen, I'm going to have my private investigator, Derrick white, stop by tomorrow with an affivit summarizing what you just said for you to sign... So, you won't sign. No, no, look, thank you for your time. Okay? Okay? Okay, thank you. Yeah, I got the address... Okay, thanks. We're going to come and have you sign the affidavits tomorrow... So, we have five attorneys who agreed to sign affidavits about our favorite sleazeball... Great. Three who refused to talk, seven who are too lazy to redo a case for a client that's already in the joint, and I mean, listen, god knows how many affidavits Don got from the public defender's office. Right... Damn. What do they want? I mean, the preliminary hearing isn't until next month. Hello. Yeah, tell him I'll come see him tomorrow morning. I don't... I don't get it. You don't have any complaints about my work on anytime burger. Your work is fine, but I pay you to be excellent. For 500 bucks an hour, our clients deserve your best. I mean, face it, your heart's just noin it. Hell, ray, did you hire my head or my heart? Heart is sometimes the only difference between victory and defeat. We are lawyers, not some football team. Allen can take over your murder trial, and then you can focus on anytime burger, or not. Louise is perfectly happy to take over as first chair. I bet she is. Sarah, you have to choose where to best to focus your energies. Yeah, but my choices will have ramifications. All choices have ramifications. You know what, I'm not going to let an innocent man wither and die in jail for a crime that he didn't commit. That's just not going to happen. I mean, maybe I'm an idealist, but I still believe that lawyers are supposed to fight for justice, not just be high-paid lackeys for corporations trying to give themselves bigger raises so they can take their dumps in gold-plated toilets. That's a mighty high horse you're sitting on. I just hope you don't fall off it one day. Okay, so let me go first, but you'll back me up, right? Locked and loaded. Harry runyon? Yeah? My name's Sarah Walsh. I'm the new attorney for Walter byrd. His second trial is next week. You testified in his first trial. You tried to send him to jail for the rest of his life? I need the original police interviews from the night of the murder. You'll have to talk to the department about that. Shall I also talk to them about the case of alamita Jones? Turns out the police lost the statement of her alibi witness who then had the temerity to got and get himself shot to death. I could also bring up the case of Ronald soule. You're full of crap, lady. All right, well, I have nine affidavits from defense lawyers who claim the police either misplaced or lost evidence that could have conveniently cleared their clients. You know what these cases have in common? You, Harry runyon. You're the investigating officer. What are you going to do about it? And then there's Carl beaumont. All of his clients are drug dealers, five of whom were sent off scot-free because the police, I.e. You, screwed up the investigation. So, are you working for beaumont? Does he pay for that nice little boat on lake Michigan? What if I am? You listen to me. You go back to your nice little life at hannon Fitzgerald, and your nice little house on the north shore. And I'm telling you that as a friend. Or what? You going to make me disappear? You conniving little... And I've been recording this entire conversation, you cocky little pig. Hey! Hey, hey, hey, dial it back. Who the hell are you? This is Derrick white. He's a private investigator. He has the whole thing on video. No comment. We just need for the files to reappear. Original police file. With rakesha's and Kevin's interviews from the night of the murder. Apparently, a mysterious package showed up at the d.A.'S office yesterday morning. Runyon found the post office. This file's going to be helpful, but it's no smoking gun. By the time I'm done with this, it'll be smoking so much it'll have lung cancer. Tell her. Spider was killed last night. No way. Got mowed down by another kid in a black hoodie. I told you Jermaine's crew was going to take care of their own. Well, I got to say this... Gangstas are way more efficient than we are. You okay? You okay? Spider got killed. He was shot last week. They don't know who did it. My god. There's more. Mac o.D.Ed. He's okay? He's dead. Damn. We still have rakesha, and she's a liar, and I can prove that at trial. Yeah? Walter, we're going to get you out of here. I don't think anything's going to save my sorry ass. Ms. Walsh? Um, thank you. Thank you for all the hard work you've done. I screw up a lot, but I never killed nobody. I know you didn't, hon. You ready? As ready as I'll ever to be. And don't go easy on rakesha. You're going to have a lot more leeway than I had. The juries are much more forgiving of nice lady lawyers. I'll have to remember to keep my brass balls hidden until just the right moment. Hey, Walter. I'm glad to see the suit fits. It looks nice. Thank you. Okay, in court, no sleeping, no doodling, no getting distracted. You got to stay clear-eyed for the jury. You're a likable guy, but they got to see that. Okay. Okay. So there were 15 people in the house, and only one of them identified my client as the shooter, and that was rakesha Anderson. Is that correct? I suppose so. But the name of Walter byrd, a man that she's known her whole life, only came to her three weeks later, when you showed her a lineup and told her who to pick, right? Objection. Sustained. Is it that you dot really care who kills a drug dealer, so you're satisfied pulling in any guy off the street and fingering him for murder? - Objection. - Sustained. So you never found the gun that killed Jermaine Anderson. No, ma'am. And you never found Walter byrd's fingerprints at the crime scene? No DNA evidence? No fibers, no hairs? No physical evidence connecting my client to the murder? No, ma'am. The prosecution calls rakesha Anderson. And there was poor Jermaine, blood pouring from his head, his life passing before my eyes. Rakesha, is the man who shot your brother in the court today? It was him! I'll never forget his face. It's tattooed on my brain. Please let the record show that the witness pointed to the defendant, Walter byrd. Thank you. Your witness. Hello, rakesha. You're, quite dramatic, aren't you? Did you practice that testimony for prime emotional impact? I just tell it how it is. Do you remember being interviewed by the police on the night of the murder? Could you be more clear, please? Yes, yes, I do. And would you say that your memory would have been better on the night of the murder? No. The defense would like to enter into evidence exhibit 37, the original interview with rakesha Anderson, conducted by detective runyon at 7:53 P.M. On the night of the murder. Bailiff, do you mind taking this to the witness? Now, you testified that the killer was wearing a black sweatshirt. That's right. Could you read paragraph a, on page 11? "Anderson says that the assailant was wearing a black hoodie." So? Judge, may I approach with exhibit 27, Walter byrd's black sweatshirt. Does this look like a black hoodie? It'slack, isn't it? Yeah. Yeah, I mean, except for this humongous yellow skull, and this crazy design. You somehow failed to mention that in your police statement. Can you please you read paragraph b, on page 11? "Anderson says that the assailant was wearing a ski mask." So, if the killer was wearing a ski-mask, then how could you tell what his face looked like? I mean, that it was Walter byrd, for instance? I just could. Do you have X-ray vision? I know what I know. Now, you sat on the witness stand and described the assailant's gun. Stenographer, can you read back that testimony? "It was steel, with a black nose and a silver butt." I'm sorry, what's so funny? Nothing. "Black nose, silver butt." Can you please read the description of the gun that you gave to the police the night of the murder? It's paragraph e, page 12. I can't find it. Judge, may ipproach? There. "Anderson describes the gun "as being all black. Black nose, black butt." How strange. Your memory is completely different eight months later. Two hours after you witnessed Jermaine's murder, you described the killer as a small guy, and skinny. Could you please read your statement on page 13, paragraph f? "Anderson describes the killer "as a short African-American man, "height approximately 5'5", weight, 110 pounds." Could you please stand up, Walter byrd? Now, look at Walter. Did you know that he is six feet tall and weighs 180 pounds? Okay, so? Do you agree that your description of the killer on the night of the murder matches nothing about Walter byrd? No, I don't agree at all. Isn't it true that you had no idea who shot Jermaine until the police brought you to a lineup three weeks after the murder? I knew the dude's face. I was just spacing on his name until I saw Walter at the police station. Well, that's convenient. Did detective runyon and his buddies help you out? Did they give you a little wink-wink when you picked out Walter? - Objection! - Overruled. No one tell'd me nothing. I saw Walter. I said, "him." Didn't you pick out Walter because he was familiar to you, because he had bought pot from Jermaine on a regular basis, including the day of the murder? Or because Jermaine had beaten him to a pulp over a dice game? I goeyes, lady. I can see. The point is not that you can see people. It's whether or not you can recognize them. Your story on the stand today is completely different than the one that you gave the cops only hours after you witnessed Jermaine's murder. Eight months ago, the killer was small and wearing a mask, and you couldn't see his face. Today, he's six feet tall, and looks exactly like Walter byrd, so why do you keep changing your story, rakesha? My story's not changing. It was Walter then, and it's Walter now. Your witness. Miss Anderson, the killing of your brother, it happened really quickly, didn't it? Three blinks of an eye, and Jermaine was gone. So basically you're just guessing at how tall and heavy the killer was? I'm doing the best I can. Yes, you are. So let's have another guess. How tall would you say Ms. Walsh is? She ain't that big. I'd say she's about, what, 5'6". Ms. Walsh, how tall are you? I'm 5'6". It seems rakesha has perfect judgement of height when she wants to. Ms. Walsh, please keep your comments to yourself. Nothing further. Redirect, your honor? Rakesha, do you know what perjury is? Yeah, a fancy word for something. Perjury is lying, lying on the stand. Now, either your memory is so staggeringly terrible, or you are lying on purpose. Now, isn't it true that you were just trying to curry favor with the police so that they don't interfere with your family's drug-dealing business? Or that they don't go after your brothers for the payback murder of the drug lord, spider, a.K.A. Nathaniel carther, who is the person that everybody knows really killed Jermaine? I ain't! You know what, lady, you talking crap! Bull crap! You an ign'ant stuck-up bitch who thinks she knows everything! You know nothin'! Nothin' about nothin'! Objection, your honor, please. Miss Anderson, do not Sully the court with bad language. Ms. Walsh, do not bring up facts that are not in evidence. Doesn't mean they're not true. Ms. Walsh. Sorry, your honor. The point is not if rakesha Anderson misremembered a few details. Without a doubt, witnessing the murder of her brother has been the most traumatic event in this young girl's life. The point is rakesha Anderson not once, ever, wavered from recognizing that man, Walter byrd, as the man who murdered her brother... His face seared into her mind. She stood her ground, even when pummeled by Ms. Walsh, a lawyer with superior education, willing to tear apart a teenage girl to win a case. Walter byrd murdered Jermaine Anderson. You know it, I know it. You must make him pay for his crime. You must find him guilty. Ms. Walsh, you may proceed with your closing statement. Thank you, your honor. I am fighting to save an innocent man's life. This is my first criminal trial. I come from the corporate world where my boss always says that nobody is indispensable, which I believe to be true, but just because we're all replaceable that doesn't make any of US disposable, and unfortunately, that's the way that Walter byrd has been treated. We all seem to agree that some African-American male killed Jermaine Anderson in what appears to be a drug slaying, but the problem is that the police weren't particularly picky about which black male they arrested. It didn't matter that Walter didn't fit the description that the witnesses gave on the night of the murder, 'cause Walter had no prospects anyway. It didn't matter that he sat in jail for eight months waiting for a trial. Well, I'm here to tell you th Walter byrd's life does matter, to his grandma, mahalia, and to his friends, and to Walter himself. Now, the police have no physical evidence that Walter byrd killed Jermaine Anderson, and no motive. The only person who thinks that Walter byrd killed Jermaine Anderson is rakesha Anderson, and quite frankly, she's changed her story a couple times. All I know is that whatever came out of rakesha Anderson's mouth wasn't true. Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, I ask you to acquit Walter byrd of this heinous crime, because he deserves his life back, not because he's special, but because his life belongs to him, and nobody is disposable. Nobody. Thank you. Maybe I should have cut out the whole "heinous crime" bit. It was a little pretentious. Nothing wrong with a little Perry Mason flourish. Sarah Walsh. Yes? Really? Okay, thank you. We'll be right there. The verdict's back. That was fast. It's only been a half an hour. Is that a good thing or a bad thing? Well, if it's not guilty, it's a good thing. If it's guilty, it's bad. All rise. Be seated, please. Will the defendant please rise? In the case of the people versus Walter byrd, how do you find the defendant? We, the jury, find the defendant... Not guilty. Congratulations. First time, too. Thank you. You're welcome. You got a second chance, Walter. Now, make something of your life. I will. Thank you so much. Thank you so much... Baby, you're coming home. Walter's not the only one getting a second chance, you know. What do you mean? I quit my job. You're kidding. I'm not, and I know I should have told you first, but it just sort of... Popped out of my mouth at the end of the day. I... This case changed me. Just... it made me believe that I can help people who actually really need it. How did Fitzgerald take it? He kind of hyperventilated with fury. Now we're really celebrating. Thank you. Well, well, well. Look at you, Ms. Walsh, lookin' fine. Aw... That's one mighty special woman you got there. You take good care of her. Yes, ma'am. And now... A special song for a special woman, Ms. Sarah Walsh, who's got more heart and more swagger than anybody I know. Yeah! Hit it. For you, baby. Thank you, Derrick. May I have this dance? Want me to show you my swagger? Okay. Come on.
