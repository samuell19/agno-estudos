[music playing] JUDGE: Mr. Foreman, has the jury reached a verdict? FOREMAN: Yes, we have, Your Honor. JUDGE: Will the defendant, Mr. Anthony Micelli, please rise? FOREMAN: We the jury find Anthony Micelli not guilty of murder in the first degree. JOSEPH: More flowers? Yeah. Oh, it's from Paul. Congratulations on a brilliant defense. Oh, you look tired. You know, you really ought to get some rest. JOSEPH: Yeah, I-- I know. I'm thinking of going to the cabin for a few days, all right? Good. But Anthony will be here any minute. I told him how busy you are, but he insisted on seeing you. Well, maybe if I hurry, I'll be gone before he gets here. No chance. He called from his car phone. He's downstairs. I'll go put these in some water, OK? I had to come here personally to thank you. The flowers were enough. Hey, flowers are never enough. Here's a little present for you, Joseph. One size fits all. You already paid me. Did I? Well, maybe this is my way of showing you how I appreciated your services. I'm sure we'll do business again. Nice view. [gun shot] Anthony, you killed him, didn't you? Like you said, no crime committed if you can't find the body. Did I quote you right, counselor? [music playing] MAN ON RADIO: High priced Beverly Hills criminal attorney Joseph Gaynor has done it again. Well-known mob boss Anthony Micelli has been found not guilty of murder. What is it about our justice system? Come on, everyone knows he did it. Our topic today is the justice system. HOMELESS MAN: Oh! What do you guys want? Get a six pack of Bud and two packs a Marlboro, all right? Right, how bout you, Allen? ALLEN: I don't want anything. You don't want a drink? No, I had enough. Aw, what the matter? The wimp's had enough, huh? Hey. Hey, check it out, man. Jesus, look at those legs. We should get some of that. What for? You know, sometimes I wonder if you have a dick. Come on. Hey, she's not doing nothing. Will that be all? Mmm, a couple packs of Marlboro. Hey, where are you going? Why? You want to come along? No, thanks. The money? Jerk. You pay for it, Betty Trusky. Security to the front, security to the front. Tattletale. [thwack] Watch out! [thwack] [groaning] [glass breaking] [thwack] [thwack] Christ sake, he's gonna kill him. Aren't you gonna stop him? Shit. Come on, man. Enough, man. She called the cops. COP: Ms. Trusky, did you get his name? BETTY: He didn't tell me his name. COP: I mean, off his ID. I didn't check his ID. You say he's about 17 or 18 years old. He puts a six pack of beer on the counter, and you don't check his ID? No, I didn't. So why don't you arrest me? - Calm down. We're not going to arrest you. You're not the criminal here. Well, you're treating me like I am. We think we know who these guys might be. If we hear anything, we'll be in touch. [muffled police radio noise] BILL: Come on, what are you doing? DORIS: Shh. I can't believe it. There's no answer. Of course, not. Like I said, the store's closed. And Bill, she should have been here an hour ago. Look, will you relax? Don't worry. She'll be there. [car engine] Sh! She's here. Look, Bill! She's here. [dog barking] [car engine] Hey, come on, guys. What are we doing here? Haven't we done enough already? We're just gonna have a little bit of fun, Allen. Let's go. Come on, dickless. Sh! Surprise! You guys scared the shit outta me! Aw. Happy birthday! God, I can't believe this! Happy birthday, honey. Thank you. I'll get you a. drink. You guys. What do ya think? You guys are too much. So how does it feel to be 25, huh? I feel like I want to take a shower. And then I want to get drunk. Great, I'll put some music on. Oh, not too loud. The man next door is such an ass. Why is that? Well, I don't know. I walk around the house half naked. You'd think he'd like being our neighbor. Yeah, you know, I should move next door, huh? Maybe. [inaudible] Hm, not bad for 25. [doorbell] I'll get it. Hi. Hello. Is Betty in? We're friends of hers from work. She invited us over tonight. She invited you tonight, to surprise her party? Yeah. Yeah, she did. Come on in. Hey, how you doin'? All right. Hey, what's with the fucking bat? Oh, this? We got to be at baseball practice right after the party. As a matter of fact, we should be practicing right now. Allen. [glass breaking] What the fuck? [thwack] [groaning] Home run! [groaning] [screaming] Come on, fellas, look what I got, huh? Come on. [glass breaking] [crying and struggling] [screaming] [screaming and struggling] [whistling] [screaming and struggling] CARL: Tattletale. Doris? [glass breaking] POLICE RADIO DISPATCHER: Negative. Your Honor, at this time, my clients would like to enter a plea of not guilty. Please, noted bail is set at $50,000. And a trial date will be announced this afternoon. But Your Honor, bail was requested by the state to be $250,000 each. These men are up on four counts of assault with intent to kill and two counts of rape. Objection Your Honor. Counsel is assuming my clients are guilty. MARION: My case is very strong. The defendants were still in the house when police arrived. Now, these rapists have-- Alleged rapists. The young men are all in protective custody of their parents. And they are all respectable citizens of our community. In other words, they're rich. One more remark out of you, counselor, and you'll be selling hot dogs in the courthouse steps. Yes, Your Honor. My decision stands. Bail is set for $50,000. Thank you, Your Honor. So what the hell are you doing here? You're supposed to be in Sacramento. I was transferred and not by choice, I might add. JUDGE: Mr. And Mrs. Gaynor? That's Walters now, Your Honor. If it would please the court, Ms. Walters? What would please the court is if you would conduct your reunion elsewhere, Ms. Walters. Yes, Your Honor. JUDGE: Thank you. So how do you like living in Sacramento? I like it fine. Look, Joseph, you probably won't understand, nor will you listen. But I'm going to try and explain it to you anyway. Now, I'm sure you read the paper. So you are aware of the brutal beatings and rape of over a dozen people in New York's Central Park. Don't tell me you're going to try to link my clients to those crimes as well. Of course, I'm not. Listen, if we're trying this case, are we supposed to talk to each other? - Yes. - Oh, good. Go on. Last week, a dozen kids enter a fast food restaurant and for no reason at all vandalized and brutally beat innocent people. And when questioned, they said they were wilding. Wilding? Your clients did it, 'cause they felt like it. They don't even have any excuse except boredom. Now, this is happening all over. And people are scared. It's got to stop. That's good, honey. What are you doing for dinner? Oh, you haven't heard a word I said. I heard you, I did. I just, uh, don't want to eat alone. We can discuss it over dinner. What do you say? No, thanks. I have a date. Ugh. Kind of a tough commute, isn't dinner, to eat with a forklift driver? MARION: He's a contractor. I don't like it. It's already getting too personal. Let me carry the ball on this one. Forget it, Jack. Look, this is my case. Now, if you want to help, help. Otherwise, stay out of my way. All right, all right, I'll help you. But I still think you should take a backseat. Not a chance. No, let's start at the beginning. Where were you last Tuesday, Carl? Me? Your name's Carl, isn't it? Don't look at him. Look at me. I'm asking you the question. Where were you? I was playing baseball. Not what you were doing, but where were you? I'm sure that a Harvard-bound student like you can distinguish the difference between what and where, can't you? Can't you? MARTIN: He was with me. - Nice try. That's real stupid. Don't call the boy stupid. You said he was playing baseball. He answered your question. Shut up, or get out. Pardon me? We're paying you a great deal of money, sir. That's right. And my reputation is as good as my record. I have never lost a case. And I don't plan on losing this one. If they are convicted, they will all have gray hair by the time you see them next. So now you listen to me, or you get yourself a new lawyer. OK. We're listening. From now on until the trial, you three will be like angels. You won't miss, or be late for a day of work. How can we miss a day of work? We don't even have jobs? I've arranged for all three of you to do voluntary work in various places in the city, a Children's Hospital, an old aged home, and a blind school. It's very important to win the hearts and souls and sympathy of the jurors. I don't work where I don't get paid. You don't work when you don't get paid? You get paid in jail, you want to work there? You do exactly what Mr. Gaynor says. And get a hair cut. You do believe they're innocent, don't you? It's not important when I believe. The jury has to believe it. They can hurt him. I can't. BILL: I just can't believe they let him walk. Now, you said you'd lock them up for good. I will. Look, this is just normal procedure. The bail is posted. They pay the bail. They're out until the trial. Yeah, but you said the bail was a quarter of a million dollars. What difference does it make? As soon as we get a jury, we lock them up. Just like that. Yes, trust me. I've prosecuted 53 cases. This one will be the easiest. I don't think I can go through with this. Of course, you can. Doris, do you want them to get away with this? No, of course not. But it took me six hours to fall asleep last night. And when I finally did, I saw their faces. I'm terrified of them. Well, I'm going on the stand. And I'm going to do whatever it takes to put those bastards away. You know, why go through all this crap anyway, you guys? If we testify, and they get out, what's going to stop them from coming after us anyway? MARION: Well, they could come after you anyway. So why not get them now? If we let them walk, then we are telling the people that the system fell apart. Help me make them a symbol for the rest of the country. Help me put them away. I can't do it without you. It's your decision. Well, you might have to do it without me. MARION: No, not this weekend. Oh, I don't know. Well, I don't know. The trial hasn't started yet. Uh-huh. Oh, how's the house coming along? Yeah. Oh, great, great. Um, oh, god, I have so much work to do. Yeah, I have to be in court at 7:30. OK. Well, we'll talk tomorrow. Good. I love you, too. Bye. [doorbell] [classical music playing] Hi. MARION: Hi. Come on in. You change your mind about dinner? No, this is business. Oh, well, then enter. Well, I see you've done very well for yourself. Private practice, like I always told you, was the way to go. Well, if it were corporate I'd understand. But criminal? I don't know, Joseph. That I don't understand. Well, then let me explain it to you. You do a good job, you get a guy off or just an inexpensive fine, he or she writes you a check. How hard is that to understand? It loses something in the translation. What is that supposed to mean? Case in point, "Anthony versus Maxwell." Everyone in the world knew he was guilty. And you get him off on a petty technicality. "State versus Scott," a 68-year-old man gets a check for $125 tax refund. He keeps it to pay his rent. And you put him in jail. It wasn't his money. Oh, do you think he really knew that? All right, "Armstein versus Conner," an open and shut case. That shouldn't have been in court more than two weeks. And you drag it out for two years. They lose crucial evidence, because it went on for so long. And your client walks. I see you've been following my career. I've been getting ill over your career. I'll never forget that first case. What, when we were married? Yeah. Yeah, I remember that, the good old days. Yeah, they were, especially the night before your first case when I held you in my arms and you cried yourself to sleep. Because you knew the man you were defending was guilty of molesting children. And you knew you had the power to get him off. And you did. Yeah, well, that was a long time ago. You want to know something? No one really gives a shit. How bout a glass of wine? No, thanks. I just came by to ask you a favor. What's that? No tricks. Play it straight, OK? See you in court, counselor. Do you believe in capital punishment? Have you ever been arrested? Do you believe in the judicial system? When a woman says no, does she means yes? Thank you very much, Mr. Peters. Accepted, Your Honor. Do you have any children, Mr. Peters? Yes, I do. How many? MR. PETERS: Two. Girls, boys? Two girls. Yeah? What are the ages? One is 22, one is 24. No, thank you, Your Honor. You're excused, Mr. Peters. State your name, please. Sally Glass. MARION: Sally, are you currently employed? Oh, yes. I work in films under contract. I'm an actress. Oh, anything I might have seen? "The Passionate Pussycat," "Three is Not Enough," "Masters and Servants." I understand. No, I haven't seen you perform. Sally, let me ask you, in any of these films, were you ever asked to partake in a rape scene? On a few occasions. And how did it make you feel? Well, let me put it this way. If I can help it, I avoid them. OK. Thank you. Accepted, Your Honor. No thank you, Your Honor. JUDGE: Court is adjourned till 10 o'clock tomorrow morning. We could go to jail. Hey, no one's going to jail. I wouldn't last five minutes in that hell hole. You should have thought about that before you raped that girl. Don't ever say what I did. Can you hear me? Don't you ever say what I did. Feel that power, Marty? Couple of hits with that bat, and you feel that power. Right. Tell me how powerful you're going to feel in jail for 20 or 50 years. No one is going to jail. I don't want to go to jail. Will you shut the hell up? No one is going to jail. We got the best lawyer in the state, maybe even the country. And if that's not good enough, we'll take care of it ourselves. Hey, what do you mean? Yeah, what do you mean? The power, gentleman. Just one or two swings more in the head with the bat, and they'll stop breathing. If it comes to that, I will kill anybody before I go to jail. I couldn't do that. I don't want any part of any killing. We are in this together. And if one of us falls, we all fall. And we don't want to fall. You got that? I mean, do you really got that? Huh? Yeah. Whatever it takes. Whatever it takes. Proceed. Wilding-- from the adjective wild, not civilized, savage, not easily controlled, a wild boy lacking social and moral restraint. Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, I'm sure you've heard this story a million times from your grandparents, a relative, your mother and father, who used to speak of a time when they would leave their front doors opened or unlocked and felt safe in their homes, when their neighbor would look out for them. Today, even with bolts and chains on our doors, we're still afraid. In New York, a group of kids beat and raped innocent people. And when questioned, they said it was fun. In Sacramento, young men enter a fast food establishment and brutally beat innocent people half to death with baseball bats. When questioned, they said they were bored. Good reason. When questioned later, they said they felt the power. Ladies and gentlemen, they felt the power of wilding. Today you as jurors sit across from three young men that the prosecution will prove have added themselves to this grotesque phenomena that's shocking our country. The prosecution will prove that these three young men brutally beat a security guard at the Mann's parking lot after they robbed the store. The defendants then followed Betty Trusky to her home where they crashed her small birthday party and brutally beat, again, Bill Paxton, and then raped Doris and Betty. Now, I'm not giving up. I'm not giving up on my neighbor. I'm not giving up on the system. And I'm certainly, certainly not giving up on you. I still have hope. The prosecution will prove that the defendants are guilty and, with your help, make them a symbol for the rest of the country, a symbol that says nobody is going to push us around anymore. We, the people, are responsible to make this country a safe place to live. Help us take the fear out of our sleep. Help us watch our TVs and not our front doors. These young men added some excitement to their boring night by wilding-- remember, not civilized, savage, lacking social and moral restraint. Let's restrain these animals, so they don't harm or rape anyone else again. Thank you. JUDGE: Will the defense state it's opening remarks? That was really lovely how the prosecution painted her own Norman Rockwell lifestyle. But what the prosecution has really done is begin to plead my case. There is crime all over the city and in New York and in Sacramento. The prosecution hasn't told you anything that you don't know. You know these things. So let's stick to the facts. Law is about facts. The fact of the matter is is that Betty Trusky and her friends were having a wild party. Personally, I never heard of people taking a shower during a party. You take one before, maybe one after. But during? So this has got to bring to your minds the question, what kind of party this is in the first place? One, there was no forced entry. Two, the door to the house that the party was being held in was locked. So this means that someone inside the house opened the door and invited my clients inside. Somewhere along the way, the prosecution is going to say that the defendants were found inside the house by the police. This is fact. But during this trial, ladies and gentlemen of the jury, I am going to prove that my clients were lured into this house of sin where a sex orgy was taking place. They were seduced and forced to perform against will lewd and violent acts upon the occupants of this house of sin. The only thing these three young men from fine families did was defend themselves. When forced to partake, they ran. When caught, they fought back. My clients are victims. My clients are falsely accused. Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, my clients are innocent. They're not guilty. The prosecution did such a good job with my opening remarks, maybe I should let her plead my whole case. Thank you. I'll have the salmon with a baked potato, salad with house dressing. Oh, my god. I just lost my appetite. Nothing for me. Hey, Joseph. Hi, Paul. I was in your courtroom this morning watching the master at work, very impressive, very impressive. Hey, at the rate you're going, you could have this case wrapped up tomorrow. - Thank you, Paul. - Hi, Linda. How you doing? - Fine, Paul. How are you? Good. Listen, uh, Joseph, can we talk in private, please? Yeah. Excuse us, honey. This is just business. Excuse me, Linda. You remember Julio Marquez? Drug dealer? Yeah, well, he's on trial over in courtroom 268. I got this guy off three times with this Judge Huxley. And now he is not buying anything I'm throwing at him. You know, he's a big client. He's worth a half a mill to me. And now he's getting cold feet. He's talking about changing his lawyers. Can you help me out here? What did he do, Paul? Well, he shot a narcotics agent. I mean, it's no big deal. He-- it's just an attempted murder charge. And if anybody can get him off, you can. Hey, look, there are no witnesses. There are plenty of alibis, alibis you wouldn't believe. And-- and besides that, I could probably squeeze 50 maybe 75 grand for you. Good. Have him come see me Tuesday morning. OK. I'll have him bring some samples, too, [sniffs] if you know what I mean. OK, so we got a deal. Oh, Sue, bring me Mr. Gaynor's check when they're through. It's on me. Bon appetit. Excuse me, I've changed my mind. I would like something. How about a lobster and filet mignon and the best bottle of champagne you have. And put 30% tip on for yourself. I get the impression you don't like Paul. I just don't like sleazy lawyers. What else is bothering you. We're winning, aren't we? I don't know, Joseph, I kind of think you were a little too hard on Marion, that's all. Don't you? No, I don't. Well, I can't just do it. Listen, Douglas, this case is very important to me. And it hasn't started off as planned. It's not your fault. Look, I've got to get-- I've got to get to bed. I've got a lot of work to do. And I-- well, of course, I see him. He's trying the case. No! It has nothing to do with it. Look, I've got to go. Fine. Fine. Goodbye. No more questions, Your Honor. JUDGE: Cross-examination? Of all the times you were with Carl, did he ever strike you? No. Threatened to hit you, raise a hand to you, clinch a fist, show any violence towards you at all? Carl? No. Carl's very gentle and caring. I mean, he's always bringing me flowers and stuffed animals. I only saw him get angry once, when a woman's purse was being taken on Boardwalk. And what did he do? He ran after the man and-- and got the purse back to the woman. He complained about how anyone could violate another person's property and how disgusting it was. I think I'm gonna throw up. You and Carl ever make love? Yes. Was it ever violent, or he ever angry while he made love to you? No. We're in love. He's gentle and warm. So he never raped you or tried tying you up or slapped you while he was making love to you? No. I didn't think so. No more questions, Your Honor. You may step down. Will you please identify your attackers? Those three over there. I would like the record to show that the witness Doris Anderson has pointed to the defendants as her attackers. No more questions, Your Honor. What did you do for work last year around this time? I don't know. I've had a lot of jobs since then. I really don't remember. Well, let me help you remember, the Personal Touch Incorporated? I worked for a telegram company. Oh, Western Union, maybe? No, a private company. What did you do at this private company? Objection. I can't see what her job has to do with her being attacked, beaten, and raped, Your Honor. It has everything to do with it. There is a direct connection between the witness's previous employment and my clients. The witness will please answer the question. Um, it's a singing telegram company. We perform at birthdays and anniversaries. We perform characters singing and dancing. Characters? What characters do you do? I do Mae West and Marilyn Monroe. And you dance? Sometimes. Would strip describe more closely the type of dancing you do when you enter a stranger's home? Sometimes, yes. Do you like seducing strangers? Sustained. Do you walk around the house the blinds open completely naked? No, not that I'm aware of. Well, let me make you aware. I have three different police reports. August 19th, a neighbor complained music too loud and woman walking around house naked. Objection. JOSEPH: August 28th-- Mr. Gaynor. Loud music and party after 3:00 AM. JUDGE: Mr. Gaynor. Two people were seen bushes having sex. MARION: Objection! May 3rd, neighbor complained of wild screams-- Mr. Gaynor. JOSEPH: --and possible drug and sex party. Objection! Counsel is badgering the witness. JUDGE: Mr. Gaynor, if you continue to go on another theatrical rampage, I will hold you in contempt. I'm sorry, Your Honor. Doris, have you ever met Carl Sloan? No, never. Are you sure? Yes, I'm positive. Look at him again. Except for the night of the attack, you cannot place that face anywhere? No, definitely not. According to the records of the Personal Touch Incorporated telegram service, you performed at a birthday party for one Greg Marks on the 8th of July last year. You drove to 8804 Sunrise Terrace in Beverly Hills. Your appointment was for a 9 o'clock stripper-gram. The company got a call that night around midnight saying you were not coming back to work. You then proceeded to drink yourself into bed with three men. Objection. JUDGE: Mr. Gaynor, will you please keep your remarks in the form of a question? The jury will disregard that last statement. That night there was a young man at that party who tried to stop you from drinking and offered to drive you home. And that young man is one of the defendants, Carl Sloan. Do you place his face now? No. I don't remember. Alcohol does make you forget things you don't want to remember. Maybe some photographs might help refresh your memory. What? JOSEPH: No further questions, Your Honor. You may step down. Court's adjourned till tomorrow morning. Why didn't you tell me about this? Because it was something that I just wanted to forget about. You know, I didn't have to testify. I was doing you a favor, and I got humiliated. It was my ass up there on the witness stand, not yours. Well, what about the police reports? The old man across the street always bitched about us. Half the time the cops even stayed for the party. I didn't know they were making formal reports. [phone ringing] What else haven't you told me? You know, I don't need this. I should have dropped charges like I wanted to. [phone ringing] Listen, when the appropriate time comes, I will put you back on the stand. You can forget about it. There is no way I am going back on that witness stand. [phone ringing] Why didn't you warn me about Doris? It's public knowledge. Anybody could go through police files. What about the pictures? There are no pictures. Are you working for me or for her? No pictures? No pictures, I'm sorry. Are you? I had to. Why? It's my case. I have to win. Even if they're guilty? You don't know that for sure. No? No. You know, I just got an offer from a private firm, partnership plus a couple of hundred thousand a year. Yeah. Well, they removed the offer after today's performance? You think you're winning this case, don't you? Well, it's not over till it's over, pal. I'm going to win this case. You know why? Why? Thank you. Because I don't get written up in "Lawyers Review." I don't win for me, Joseph. I win for justice. And that's a hell of a lot more than money can buy. Yeah. Well, sometimes money can buy justice. Might I remind you that I, too, have never lost a case. I guess she told you. She did, didn't she? Yup. MARION: This is our last hope. Now, if we can get a solid testimony from you and Betty, we can win this case. Look, Bill, we've gone over this 1,000 times. The defense is going to come at you with both guns loaded. They're going to try and break you any way they can. I know. Yeah, but you're gonna have to relive the nightmare of that party. Not only by my questioning, but by the brutal attack of the defense. - Look, I'm not Doris. OK? I've got nothing to hide. We know that. We believe that. But we also know that you have a temper. Hey, I want revenge, damn it. Damage Those kids should die. Bill, look, that's exactly what the defense is gonna try and get you to do. Listen, it's patience and composure that gets a jury's ear, not screaming for a hanging. Do not think revenge. Think the facts. Now, let's go. Come on. Cross-examination? Mr. Paxton, do you mind if I call you Bill? If you like. Bill, you Betty and Doris have been friends for how long? About eight years. And how would you describe your relationship with them? We're best friends. Do you have a girlfriend? I date. How many parties have you been to at their house? I'd say just about all of them since they moved there, five, no six to be exact. You ever sleep overnight? On occasion. Neither of them ever make advances towards you when you've stayed there? Like I said, we're just friends. No further questions, Your Honor. Thank you, Mr. Paxton. That's it? Yeah, that's it. You may step down. I want to know what the hell's going on. What are you talking about? Your cross-examination of Bill Paxton. What about it? It was nonexistent. You interviewed him. You know he acts like Dirty Harry. A first year law student would have had him screaming his way into a mental ward. What do you want from me? First, I'm too good. Now, I'm not good enough. What will make you happy? To win this case and beat you at your best. If your clients are guilty, then cop a plea. If they're not, don't throw the case away, for Christ's sake. Betty, on the evening of June 22nd this year, where were you at 10:00 PM? I was at work. And where do you work? The Mann's Market on Circle Canyon Road. Will you please tell the court what happened? It started at work when Bob, our security guard, was severely beaten in the parking lot. Will you tell us exactly what you saw? I remember him walking out to the parking lot to collect money from that man, who walked out without paying. I would like the record to show that the witness has pointed to Carl Sloan, one of the defendants. JUDGE: So noted. And then what happened? Well, out of nowhere came someone with a baseball bat. And the bat swung down and hit Bob on the arm, and then again on his back. And Bob fell to the ground. The boy dropped the bat, and he ran. And then another boy picked up the bat and swung down on Bob's head. I turned away. Every time I looked back the bat was raised high over the boy's head. And on its way down, I turned away. I kept hearing laughter mixed with thumping. And I kept turning away. I covered my ears and prayed he would stop, but he kept swinging the bat. Felt like hours until I turned around, and the boys were gone. Bob was lying in the parking lot. I was sure he was dead, but he wasn't. Are you all right? Your Honor, I would like to request a recess due to the continuous stress my key witness must endure during this trial. JUDGE: Court is adjourned till 10 o'clock tomorrow morning. Thank you. How do you want to do this one, man? I want to do this one myself. I knew would come in handy. This isn't right, man. (TEASING) This isn't right, man. What the fuck is wrong with you, Allen? No, it's not right. But it's necessary, all right? Remember, Allen, necessity is the mother of invention. Yeah, right. Guys, watch the car. Beep if you see anything strange. I'll be right back [tv static] Tattletale [gun shot] MARION: At this time, Your Honor, I regret to inform the court that last night that Betty Trusky was shot and killed in her home. Police are calling it attempted robbery. I would like to express mine and the court's deepest sympathy at this time. Since she was the prosecution's last witness, I suggest if counselor has no objections, we go on with the defense. In light of Betty Trusky's murder, the prosecution requests a week to further prepare its case. I understand your grief over the loss of your key witness. But Your Honor, the defense is prepared to plead its case. If the prosecution is just buying time-- Your Honor the prosecution has just been informed that an eyewitness who originally refused to testify is now willing to cooperate. Now, tomorrow I will be able to produce that witness. Your Honor, here is the name and the address of that witness. She's been visiting relatives out of town. And it's taken us this long to track her down. JUDGE: You will get 24 hours. And this witness better have a lot to say. Thank you. Court's adjourned till tomorrow morning. What's the problem? You heard the lady. She found an eyewitness. See, it's standard procedure, Mr. Micelli. Now, what I want to do first is get you out on bail. So I'm gonna take you before Judge Huxley-- Huxley? Hey, don't worry about Huxley. I got him in my back pocket. We are like this. Now, if I get you off, I get an additional $100,000-- What do you mean if? Did I say if? No, I mean, when I get you off, I get an additional $100,000. Now, between me and you, did you kill this guy? It's none of your fuckin' business. OK. I can live with that. All right, come on. Let's go. What the hell is going on here? What are you holding out on me? Take is easy, Jack. What the hell do you mean, take it easy? We're getting our ass kicked in there. Then you-- then you come up with this witness? We don't have a witness. Who the hell is this witness? The witness is me. I used a fake name and gave them my address. What? Hey, those bastards are guilty. Now, it's my guess that they killed Betty. If they're scared, they'll come after me. You're crazy. You're going to get yourself disbarred. You're gonna get yourself killed. Jack! Listen, I didn't hear any of this. You're on your own now, counselor. Hey, Joseph and Linda, how are you? Hey, hey, Joseph, why didn't you return my call? Hey, don't turn your back on me, your cocksucker? You take my money, and then you let me hang? [spits] Piece of shit. You're all the same, whores! Nothing but whores! You fucking-- - Calm down. Guys, let me at him. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, calm down. ANTHONY: I'll get you for this, Joseph. I swear till the day you die, I'll get you. Nobody [inaudible]. Hey, Anthony, Anthony, take it easy, Anthony. Take it easy. I've got everything under control. Listen, uh, sorry about that, Joseph. He's, uh, he's a little upset. I just, uh-- I just took him for 100 Gs. You know, if-- if we don't find this witness and kill her, tomorrow on the stand that bitch DA is going to crucify us. Let's do it, man. Let's just do it now. I can't. I can't do this shit, Carl. What are we doing? I don't want to kill anyone. We've hurt enough people already. We haven't done anything. I told you, man. I told you he was gonna to be a problem, didn't I? Maybe we can just tell the truth. We can't tell the truth. Don't you understand that? We can't fuckin' tell the truth. OK. OK. I know, I'll say it's my fault. I started it. I'll take the blame. I'll tell 'em I did everything. But you didn't kill Betty. I'll tell him I-- killed Betty. You're going to do that? You're going to tell him you shot Betty? Yeah. I'll tell him I shot Betty. All right, come here. So you're gonna to go to the cops. And you're gonna tell 'em you broke into that place alone? Yeah. You're gonna say you smashed everything up, you raped that girl yourself? Uh-huh. And then you're gonna tell them you went back alone and shot Betty? Yeah. [choking and struggling] OK, man. What's with the fucking gun? Just tyin' up a few loose ends. Nothing personal. No! [gun shot] [phone ringing] Yeah? LINDA: Joseph, it's Linda. Linda, what did you find out? Allen's dead. What? LINDA: Allen's dead. How? LINDA: Hung from a backstop in a baseball field. If it's suicide, my guess is our boys are guilty. JOSEPH: And if it's murder, [sigh] our boys are still probably guilty. What about Marion's, uh, witness? There isn't one. What do you mean there isn't one? LINDA: There isn't one. Linda, hang up. I got to use the phone. [phone ringing] MARION: Mmm. [phone ringing] Hello? Marion? Joseph? Marion, you all right? Of course, I'm all right. My god, what time is it? It's late. Listen, I'm sorry I woke you. I'll talk to you tomorrow. - Yeah, good night. Good morning, Miss. Walters. Good morning. Morning, Thompson. You smell good this morning, detective. Oh, it's something I found downstairs. I hope you don't mind. I don't mind. [thwack] [thwack] Detective? Oh! Awh. Agh! [car breaks] Where's the witness? Where's the witness? Ah! There is no witness. Ah! You bitch. You set me up! [screaming] No, no! [glass breaking] [glass breaking] [motorcycle engine] [thwack] [car breaks] [car horns] [cheering] [crash] [car horns] [crash] MAN ON RADIO: Oh, my, has "Hot Topic" got a topic today that's burnin' our phone lines. It seems Beverly Hills Attorney Joseph Gaynor's in the news again. But this time, he's been arrested for murder. Now, let's talk about it on our lines. Call me, 1-900-HOT-OPIC. Call me. Let's do it JACK: Marion, you're not even listening to me. The man is guilty. The man is a murderer. MARION: It was self-defense. JACK: Self-defense? It's 10 blocks away from the original attack. Come on, who are you kidding, Marion? He saved my life. Look, let's not go to court. Let's settle for five. He'll be out in two. That's insane. Look, Jack, I'm defending him. Marion, once you cross to the other side, there's no going back. Yeah, well, maybe I'll like the other side. It's not your league. It's not in you to free a guilty man. He's not guilty. Marion, I've got enough witnesses to fill Dodger Stadium. Let's avoid a trial. I don't want it to get dirty. I owe him. You don't know him shit. All right, level with me. What has he given you? What, a quarter of a million, half a million, what? Nothing. Oh, god. You still love this guy. That's it. Look Marion, I tried to be fair. I tried to cut a deal. If this goes to trial, it's your funeral. Thank you. So what did Jack say? He said five years, out in two. I said no. Two years? That tells you what he thinks of me. Joseph, he's just doing his job. The trial starts next week. You know, this is really ironic. I used to have a case just like this one, two witnesses. I was gonna put-- Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Remember, you're the client. Now, if you don't like the way I'm trying this case, get yourself another lawyer. I'm sorry, Marion, you're right. I'm just running a little scared, you know? I never been on this side of the law before. Well, neither have I. Uh, Miss. Walters? Jury's comin' in now. JUDGE: Mr. Foreman, has the jury reached a verdict? FOREMAN: Yes, we have, Your Honor. JUDGE: Bailiff. will the Defendant, Joseph Gaynor, please rise? We, the jury, in the above entitled case "State of California versus Joseph Gaynor" find the defendant not guilty. All right! [applause] Joseph, congratulations. [MUSIC- JASTEREO, "FOR JUSTICE TODAY"]
