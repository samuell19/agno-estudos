Look, will you go to sleep if I told you a fairy story? Let's hear it then first. All right, close your eyes. Once upon a time, there was a beautiful girl her name was Cinderella. I've heard that one. Oh no, no you haven't. This is an entirely different story. She went to a dance and she met a fairy prince. Well, he was not a fairy, he was a seaman gunner and a couple of good conduct stripes and he fell in love with her. Now, the moment the magnificent prince, with a seaman gunner's badge and the two good conduct stripes, saw the beautiful Cinderella, he said to himself, blimey what a turn up for them. Come on, Admiral. What about that milk? Admiral? All visitors ashore, please. Come on along, man, pull yourself together. That's the gong for the visitors ashore. Come along. Let go of that rail. Admiral! Now, the fairy prince turned to Cinderella and said, does thou think thou could fall in love with a charming fairy prince like me ducks? With that, he took her into his arms and he whirled her into happiness with an all consuming passion. What does that mean? What do you care? In any case, you're far too young. Now look, if you go to sleep like a good boy, the next time the fairy prince goes to sea, he'll bring you back a beautiful present. A real live mermaid. I'm sorry, Jane. I want my milk! All right, I'll go and get your blooming milk. Hey, mister, at last the boat she is going, huh? Yes, and I've got to get off. Listen my friend, I live in Tangiers. Three months ago, I cross the water to Al Aferias for the day. Do you mind? On the way back, the ferry boat, what I am, is torpedoed. I am rescued by American boat, so I go to America.

Don't be a fool, let go. Have some sense. Come on, drop it. Saw the rail off. He can keep the piece. What have you been giving him to drink, secatine? At last the boat, she sails. What? He said the boat, the boat it's sailing. Yes, that's right, sir. What are you two doing here? We've started. You're telling us. Where's my brother? He's in there, full of milk.

Hans, you don't know your captain. I don't know, he's always there. If I'm wrong, I'll buy every loaf of bread in your shop the first day I reach London. You would? Why don't you go and find out? Very well, I will. You'll find I'm right. 60 or 70 of them. There's three of us. I tell you, it's easy. What is? To pinch their ship. Do what? You're mad. It can't be done. Can’t it? With that thing giving orders and no one seeing who gives them? Here he comes. Well? I was quite right. The captain is sleeping in his cabin. That's all we wanted to know. You will have to buy all my loafs. Yeah. Now, you want to go to England, don't you? We're gonna make a break for it. Are you with us? Open it. Good work, Johnny. What are you going to do? You're going to show us the way to the bridge. Go on, go on. How do you feel now, Fritz? I'm sorry about the toe. Come on. Now come on, boys. When I give you the word I want you to go like greased lightning forward and slip the anchor. Yeah, but somebody may stop it. They won't, take this. Johnny, your jobs the engine room. How many down there? Four, five, six. You can handle them, here. Your job is to keep the engineers at it. Easy. Wait for it, wait for it. You've got to catch before they bolt. Why should they bolt? You'll find out. What's German for abandon ship. For what? Abandon ship. Right. You're crazy, they won't believe you. Tell 'em it's part of the exercise. Come on. Come on, come. I don't think they will do it. Go on, go on. All right, now’s your time. Admiral, the anchor. Johnny, the engine room and I'll give you the word through the loud speaker. Well played sir, well played. Oh, Johnny. Back to stations, quick. Go on, all of you. Get back, go on. Jump to it, go on, get back. Back against the wall. Now hurry up. That's the way to talk to 'em. Remind me to tell 'em to make me a captain, sometime, will ya? The captain, he is down in his cabin. Blimey, I forgot him. Tell me, where's his speaking tube? This one. It's all right, I hear him talking. Now, I'll tell you what to do. Shout down, tell the old fool to come up here. Tell him there's trouble on the bridge, tell him anything. I'll stand behind the door and as the silly old battle axe comes through, I'll dot him on the crumpet, right up my street, it's easy. Go on tell him. No, no pep it up. Go on. That's the idea, that will bring him up here in no time. Now, what can I dot him with? How do you do? Are you happy in your works? So, you will dot the silly old battle axe with a trumpet? Did he say that? I will count three and then you will be gone. I shouldn't bother to count, I'll go now. Stay where you are! No trouble. One, two. Heil Hitler. Has the last boat gone yet? Just going. Good, then we're all set to slip the cable. Admiral, stand by. He's not there yet. - Not there? - No. I'm here, I'm here. Help, help! Admiral, Admiral, can you hear me? Admiral, don't lie down on us. I'm trying not to. Admiral. I'll go. No, I need you to speak to the engineers. Johnny, are you there? Hello, Johnny. Hello, are you all right? All set. Okay, stand by to start 'em up. And that goes for me, too. Go on, obey those orders. Quick! And now for the anchor. You stay here. When I cut her away, give full speed ahead and when I get that admiral I'll use his liver for a neck tie. It's all right, he's here, look. Okay, Admiral, let her go. Jump to it. Where have you been all this time? Messing us about, keeping us all waiting. What do you think you're doing, knitting? Go on, hit it man, hit it. You're not playing crown and anchor. Hooray. Now go to the steering wheel, go on, at the double. Quicker! Everything's in order now, Hans. Johnny's in the engine room, Admiral's at the wheel, and I'm on the bridge. Slow ahead. Go on, do that and do it quick. Full speed ahead. Hurry up, do as the gentlemen says. Look, look the boats. Ta ta, have a good row, boys. Bye bye. Hans, we've done it. But what do we do now? Bang off home as fast as we can. Admiral, are you there? Aye, aye, sir. Where to? Portsmouth harbour, but stop at Selfridges to put Hans off, first. Aye, aye, sir. Johnny, Johnny. We've done it. I've pinched their blinking battleship. You pinched it? What about me? Yes, sir. Come down here and drive it. There's something wrong. He doesn't answer. Johnny, Johnny. Look quick, the engineers. They're trying to escape. I told him to keep them down there. Hey, come back. Get back to that engine room. Stay where you are. What do you mean letting them go, you twerp. I'll talk to you later. See what you've done? You frightened them away. Well, we're getting along all right without them. Yeah, we got her started. How are we gonna stop her? We don't want to stop it. Home, James, and don't spare the horses. 10 degrees, 44 minutes south. 39 degrees, 12 minutes west. Are you sure you're right? There's not an island anywhere in sight here. Well it's the last entry in the log. You can't get away from that. Did you say 39 or 93? 39. Oh, well of course. That makes all the difference in the world. Here we are, island and all. There we were this afternoon, you mean. It's close to midnight now. Well, we've been steering due east. Say 50 knots. That brings us to 15 two, 15 four and a pair of six. Here we are, right in the middle of Portuguese west Africa. Ahoy there Tommy, ahoy. Tommy? What's that? Put the brakes on, we've run somebody over. Ahoy there, Admiral. I say, you know we stopped moving, I suppose it's all right. So we have. Haven't we, yes. Johnny, ahoy there, Johnny. Ahoy there, skipper. What's happened to the engines? Nothing, we're doing a steady... No we're not. We're not doing anything. Look, on top of the water. Oil. Tommy. Oil, oil, everywhere oil. I suppose that's Johnny's idea of having a good time. He wants to play. All right, I must of turned the wrong tap or something. These darn German engines are terrible. They aren't a bit like the ones on the Ferocious. You've ditched us good and proper. I suppose we'll have to sit here and eat bananas till the cows come home. I say, you fellows, crude bit of oil about. Somebody must of emptied our sump. I think somebody must of emptied yours. Well, there's no use standing here. I think we ought to see if we can do something. I say, llewelyn. Yes. If you take this off, you'll be able to see better. Oh, thank you very much. Well anyway, it's dark. Now what I suggest is we mend the radio and then we can get the Ferocious to come and fetch us. I'll have a go at the radio. Sure, you're a marvel with machinery. I don't see what you're all worrying about. Some ship or other is bound to pass soon. Here we are, 200 miles from the nearest trade route. There won't be a ship passing here from year's end to another. Look. It's a destroyer. What, one of ours? German, she's flashing a signal. Yeah and if she doesn't get the right reply. She's liable to open fire. I know the right reply. - Well come on. - Yes. GL twice, then wait. Am I glad you remembered that right. - Chaps are starting a message. - Make an R. H. I. E. R. H-i-e-r, here. They don't spell very well, do they? It's in German, ya. W-o-I-f. Wolf, well that's English enough. Wolf, that is her name. We can't take on 10 prisoners. Supposing the bananas give out. I wonder if they're British. What's the odds? We can let the poor blighters stay put. Hans, how do you spell okay in German? O-k. Okay. But don't you realise, you poor dope, an officer will bring the prisoner's aboard. Yes and he'll expect to be received by the captain. All right, he will be received by the captain. Ah, stop your shoving. Hello, boys. Haven't I seen that ugly mug before? Was is das, mug? I say, dear, most extraordinary thing. It's exactly like your brother. Llewelyn. All right, all right. A much nicer boat, but anywhere. Ah, there we are. Look, auntie, there's Jane's brother. Don't be silly, dear. It's a no good coming on board. 11 times I've been torpedoed. Two more times is 13, that's unlucky. Don't you touch me. I'm a non belligerent from Tangiers. Oh, the British sailor. Did you got your glass of milk? Pig dog, pig dog. He no speak English. There's the sailor that told me the rotten fairy story. Tommy. Pig dog. I'm kidding, I'm kidding. I'll lay you 10 to one we don't spot her today. Make it 20 to one. We'll split the difference, 15. Okay, only I'm inclined to think the Ludendorf's camouflaged herself as a coral reef or something. Right, let me machine gun every coral reef of correct size and shape. Ahoy, ahoy. What have you sighted? I don't sight anything. I just say ahoy! Well don't shout ahoy for nothing. You'll frighten the fish. Here, pass the bait, please. I can't understand why they don't like these. I mean, after all, there must be some vegetarians amongst them. Oh if only we had worms. Yeah, what? Oh I see what you mean, yes. Well you know, you can't blame the poor things. I mean three weeks of unadulterated banana. Perhaps we could camouflage. That's a very good, by Jove, I've got a bite. - No. - I've got a bite. Help me, help me. And that, madam, concludes our inspection of this highly desirable residence. Central heating throughout, sleeping accommodation for 850 and within easy reach of the sea. Very nice, thank you. And now I must go and help Mrs. Pilkington with the lunch. Oh Jane, I mean Ms. Davis, don't go. Look, I've got an apology to offer. Oh? On Johnny's behalf. That night on the Savannah, getting your brother lit to the eyebrows, he's a terror. Johnny I mean, not llewelyn. You know, even the marines won't go out with him. The next thing you'll know... I'll be lit to the eyebrows, too, I suppose. Ahoy, there, ahoy! It's enemy aircraft approaching. It is a plane. Ahoy there, can you see her markings? Oh, it's all right. It's enemy British aircraft. It's British aircraft. Ahoy! Hooray, at last we are saved. She will take me back to Tangiers. It's ours, it's a plane from the Ferocious. How perfectly delightful. Yeah, but here here. She think we're German, she'll let fly at us. Blimey, that's right. We're still the Ludendorf from her point of view. Come on, women and children below. I'm in the kitchen. Well go on, hurry. Boys to the search lights, we gotta signal her. Come on. Mister, don't shoot, don't shoot. We are friends of yours. Dear little Digby. I suppose he's ruined every lamp on the ship. What about the signal flares? No good, they are different from the British. Maybe you better write a note and send it up to him. Right, we'll write. Come on, the paint. Here they are. Help me, so. Well, what message are we gonna write? We'll have to keep it short. Right oh yes, dear, sir. Cut it out. Tell them to notify the American consulate. Pip down Slugsy. Now, let me see, possibly... I know. The swastika, come on. Come on, sir George, sir Andrew, and sir Patrick. What we say, 20 to one? No, 15. I wonder why she hasn't opened up. She's waiting for you. Toujour la politesse. Hurry, British! Can you see what I see? It's the Union Jack, - there's no mistake about that, sir. - Seems incredible. [??] will be gone cracker, sir. That's why I used my camera. - Very likely a trap, don't you think so, sir? - We'll see. I'll close in on her now. All guns loaded and bearing on her. See if that will draw her fire. Commander, hands to action stations immediately. Very good, sir. Come then, jump to it, the sound of action stations. Ladies and gentlemen. More champagne. I'm going to ask you to drink to the health of our four hosts. But for who's courage and presence of mind we shouldn't of been sitting here today in happy anticipation of rescue. Our four hosts. Speech, speech. Speech. Unaccustomed as I am to public speaking, I feel that I must play the perfect host and say a word or two of gratitude to you in answer to your lovely piece of toast. ♪ To help has been an awful lot of fun ♪ ♪ and now I say to you ♪ ♪ what I say to everyone ♪ ♪ when your pockets are full of trouble ♪ ♪ and the merry go round goes wrong ♪ ♪ don't sigh ♪ ♪ don’t cry ♪ ♪ sing a happy go lucky song ♪ ♪ when your horoscope says a blue day ♪ ♪ and the minutes seem far too long ♪ ♪ don't moan ♪ ♪ don't groan ♪ ♪ sing a happy go lucky song ♪ ♪ you lucky people ♪ ♪ here's a melody ♪ ♪ you lucky people ♪ ♪ sing a song with me ♪ ♪ when there's nothing but stormy weather ♪ ♪ till the summer time comes along ♪ ♪ be gay ♪ ♪ today ♪ ♪ sing a happy go lucky song ♪ ♪ if your mother in law's got symptoms ♪ ♪ and discusses them all day long ♪ ♪ don't cringe ♪ ♪ don't binge ♪ ♪ sing a happy go lucky song ♪ ♪ if your eyes go dark and soulful ♪ ♪ and your a chins a pinch too long ♪ ♪ don't pine ♪ ♪ for mine ♪ ♪ sing a happy go lucky song ♪ ♪ you lucky people ♪ ♪ you good cause to cheer ♪ ♪ hey you lucky people ♪ ♪ shout the Navy's here ♪ ♪ I'm the Ludendorf's brand new captain ♪ ♪ a position I shan't hold long ♪ - Hey! - # but still # Hey, hey, hey, hey! I say everybody, there's boats full of Germans coming towards the ship. Take no notice, take no notice. Don't interrupt and don't steal my stuff. 'Cause if anyone's gonna be funny around here it's going to be me. Dozens of them. Armed to the teeth, cutlasses and everything. Yes and guns some of them. One of these days, one of your stories is going to come true and you're going to look very very silly. Hands up. Back against the wall, everybody. Quick come on, you too. Hey, mister. I am Luda from Tangiers, involuntarily I am here. North, south, east, and west. Silence, go back against the wall, you. Shall we try and rush 'em? I'm not in the mood for suicide. If only we could stall them till the Ferocious arrives. So. They have sighted the Ferocious. Your faces to wall. I am a man of honour. I do with my face to the foe. A turn around, Louis, they won't know the difference. Your faces to the wall. Bridge, red 30. German battleship on port bow. Hello, hello. They are going to open fire on the Ferocious. And she'll come right in without doing a thing after our message. The Germans are gonna blow them right out of the water. Come on. Get him tied up. Bloody good. Now the women and children stay here. The rest up on the deck. We've got to stop them firing those guns. Come on. Hello. That's for the first torpedo. Well done. Look what I got, look. I put it in a white flag to show I am a non belligerent. Good. Come on. Come on. Look out. You go on, Tommy. I'll attend to these two. That's for the magnetical mines. Thanks, pal. Must be all right, sir. They've of opened fire by now. Yes. Well within range of their main armament. Okay, Johnny. Let her go, all right. Fire! - Oh excuse me. - Oh, yes, sir. Thank you. Thank you. Ah ha. Let me up. - Let me down let me up. Oh. Ah now, out you go. With your hands above your head. Go on now, go on. Out you go, out. So you're taking it lying down, eh? Ah ha, the dirty dogs. That's five torpedoes I am doing good. Bravo. Well, that seems to be about the lot. And not a shot fired at the good old Ferocious. It is a trap. All right, we'll let 'em have it. I suppose you fired that gun. Dear little Digby. Johnny, quick, let's get to the semaphore. Hans, get a white flag or something. - Admiral, hold down the ensign. - Right. The rest of you stay below. Come on. Open fire right away. Bridge, Control Top, open fire! They're firing at us. Well, what do you expect? We fired on them. Please, please, please. I must have a white flag. Good work, we nearly got her first time. We ought to get her with the second salvo. Stop, oh. Stop, stop! White flag. This is all I could find. Quick, where's the white flag? This is it. Why don't you do something? Glass of milk, please. What, are you at it again? Hey, come on you two, get below quick. I think we've crippled her, sir. She's not replying. Well then, give her another salvo and make sure. Give me something. Oh, oh my bag. You can't have my bag, no you can't. Heliograph message from the Ludendorf, sir. All right, take it down. Message, to Commander Ferocious from AB, commanding Ludendorf. Cease firing. It's us. T. Taylor, J. Meadows, L. Davis. Reporting for duty. P S Do you want any bananas? So it is that HMS Ferocious returns in triumph to her home port, after a voyage that makes Trafalgar sound like a trip 'round the lake. The three heroes are congratulated by the Admiral on the part they played. Johnny Meadows. Llewellyn Davis, nicknamed 'The Admiral' because you never see him working. Tommy Taylor, the leader of the party. The mastermind of the mess deck. Their gallant ally, Hans Mueller, hears that he will immediately become a full British subject, and the fuller the better. Newlywed Mrs. Tommy Taylor leads the cheers. They've got thousands to come in prize money and this will be a leave where nobody says leave off. Ha, you lucky people.
