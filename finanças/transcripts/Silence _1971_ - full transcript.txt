In the 16th century, Martin Luther appeared. He criticized the Roman Church, savagely attacking the Church and clergy. The resultant break of the protestants produced... ...a serious religious crisis in Europe. In 1534, in Spain, Loyola founded the Society of Jesus. It reflected the crisis in Catholicism. They fought to rebuild the Church... ...and widened their work beyond Europe. In 1549, along with the gun, Francisco Xavier landed on the southern shores of Japan. 30 years later, more than 200 churches, 75 priests and 300.000 believers appeared. Japan's rulers were worried about the new religion's rapid spread, since it came with the gun. Both examples of Western culture... ...put fear into the hearts of the rulers. Suppression! The latter half of the 16th century was... ...a bitter time for Japan's Christians. Countless Padres and believers were killed. Some disappeared. Padre Ferreira also disappeared. CHINMOKU Story by Shusaku Endo Screenplay by Shusaku Endo and Masahiro Shinoda Photographed by Kazuo Miyagawa Music by Toru Takemitsu Starring David Lampson Mako Iwamatsu Don Kenny Tetsuro Tamba Yoshiko Mita Shima Iwashita Directed by Masahiro Shinoda Padre... In Macao, you promised to pay me... ...as soon as we reached Japan, with some extra. Remember? I've wanted to ask you... Are you a Christian, Kichijiro? Are you really Japanese? Of course. I am Japanese. If the officials come, you don't know me. Don't forget. We understand. Be sure. I'm going now. Padre! Padre! Padre! Our hearts are the same as yours. You must change into these quickly. You must not be seen. Please hurry! Padre! Shut the door! Rest here tonight. At dawn we'll take you to the mountains. You'll be safe here. No one comes here. Are there no priests? No monks? No priests or monks have come for years. If we were caught, all would be killed. We only trust our own village. Strangers would turn us in right away. What about prayers? Baptism and teaching? We do it all. We do the best we can, each taking a part. We've hid and kept on for all these years. The Padres and monks all left us. They went away. That sound? It's rain. The rainy season has started and it's long. "Let's be on our way "To a temple in heaven. "It is called the Temple of Paradise. "It is known as the great temple. "That temple exists in our hearts." Please listen to me. Does anybody know where Padre Ferreira has gone? He came to Japan twenty years ago. And he preached here. He went to the capital and to Edo. We know only he was captured five years ago. Since that, nothing. Has anybody here heard anything about him? In Portugal, when Garrpe and I were children, he taught us about the lord. We decided to come here to teach... Padre Ferreira's teachings. So we want to know what has happened: Whether he is alive or has died bravely... ...and gone on to Paradise. Do you know anything? How about you? We warned you. You must never go outside. Don't be angry. We just wanted a little sun. Never go out of here again! Get in here if something happens. Please open the door. Don't be afraid. We, fishermen, haven't seen a Padre for years. Won't you trust us? Five days ago... We watched you from the other mountain. We heard Padres were in Tomogi Village. From who? From Kichijiro, a Christian among us. Yes, Padre. But is he a Christian? He surely is a Christian. Eight years ago a man reported his family. They were told to step on a medallion. The Lord's image was carved on it. The fumi-e? His brother and sister refused. But Kichijiro was terrified. He said he'd give up the faith. His brother and sister were burned alive... ...at the stake, the very next day. And Kichijiro disappeared. And he showed up again? And told about us? He's boasting he brought Padres to Japan. He's popular in our village. We don't have Mass or Confessions. We just say our prayers. Come to us, Padre! Please come. That day the wind was very strong. They were thrown into the crater of a volcano. The place was called Hell Valley of Mt. Unzen. Fathers Ludovico. Johann. Antonio... Julian, Marta, Michael... Thomas, and Ignatius. I remember it all very well. The pagans cheered as each one fell. Uneme Takenaka was a real demon. And Matsukura, too. They caught Fathers Dominico and John. Their hands were tied behind them. Straw mats were wrapped about them and set afire. As the fire spread, they began to hop around. The pagans laughed at the mat dancers. They enjoyed it. And things have gotten worse. Being a Christian is even more difficult today. And Magistrate Inoue is all to blame. He's the king of the demons. The leader of the demons. The islanders were very happy to see you. They waited a long time for a Padre to come. Girls even smile at me since I brought you. Listen to me. I know what you want to say. But I've reformed. So I'm showing you around. Why did you say you'd give up the faith? Just a momentary confusion. I don't feel that way now. Can you swear that to me? That you'll keep the faith under any pressure? I swear! So please forgive what I've done. But, Padre, you don't know how they torture us. That's why you're so angry now. Some people are strong; others are weak. The strong bear up and go to heaven. But a weak man like me... Padre! The officials! In the village? They've found us. Us, too? They don't know about you. Garrpe? I'll take you to him. No time for talk! It's been reported that there are Christians. Now give me their names. For 100 pieces of silver. Take him! We'll take him as hostage till you talk! We'll come back in three days for more hostages. Think it over. We didn't tell them about you Padres. And we never will. No matter what! But that means you'll all be taken hostage. Yes, but we still won't talk. Rather than that, we should leave Tomogi. We'll go to Kichijiro's island. But since they came here, they'll go there, too. Go farther away. I'd like to go along, but it's dangerous. Since you still say no, we must believe you. But we must find out who is lying. You all or the informer. The hostages will then return. Today we must take three more to Nagasaki. We won't harm them. Those three are... You... you... And you! The magistrate will see you're not Christians. Then I'll send all of you back here. You know Christianity is heresy, don't you? It was reported that you believe that heresy. How do you plead? We always pay our taxes. We have Buddhist funerals. Then you claim you are really not Christians? Yes, sir. Well, that makes the Magistrate happy. Do you know what this is? A Christian carving. Exactly. It's Virgin Mary whom they praise. But it has no value to you non-Christians. Step on it! You must step on this! What's wrong? Non-Christians should not mind stepping on it. So you think you've fooled us? I saw your heavy breathing. You're wrong. We're not Christians. Then spit on this! And say Virgin Mary is a whore! No? How about you? And how about you? Spit! We hear you! "Let us be on our way "To a temple in heaven. "It is called the Temple of Paradise." Padre! Padre! Been a long time! Don't go alone. The officials are on this island, too. Eat it! Eat it! We use these snakes for medicine. Is there a river? You want some water? You sure gobbled that dried fish down. Isn't there a river? A river... Padre! Why did you run off? Don't you trust me? Don't feel bad. I'm just very tired. Won't you just leave me alone? Alone? What for? I know a village with Christians and Padres. Padres? And they're not Japanese priests. Padre, you don't trust me anymore. Mokichi was strong, like a paddy we plant. But a weak paddy stays weak no matter what. I was born weak, Padre, like this paddy. Kichijiro, kneel! Our Lord was crucified. Our Lord was crucified. Our Lord was crowned with thorns. Our Lord was crowned with thorns. Padre, forgive me! Forgive me! I'm weak, not strong like Mokichi or Ichizo. Here they come! Look how big he is! Nagasaki Magistrate sent us... ...to take custody of Padre Rodrigues. Thanks for your trouble. I can speak Japanese. Then I don't need to use the foreign tongue. I learned it at seminary. I went to seminary, but I'm not a Christian. Why did you study then? To succeed in life. A samurai can take up arms or education. I chose education. You knew Christianity is heresy. Still you came. Why? I'm ready for martyrdom. Blind bravery like yours is a bother to others. Christianity is like an unwelcome gift... ...that is forced on the receiver. We have our own religion. We don't need yours. Things taught to us at seminary are useless. Silly bickering! Bickering? Change! They're clean. They're Buddhist priest's sacred garments. I don't need them. Change quickly. The officials are coming. It's a Padre! I didn't know we had a Padre here. I've been here for five days. Have you... He speaks Japanese well. It's amazing. You mustn't talk. Lord Chikugo is concerned about you. Be comfortable. Rodrigues from Portugal. Came from Macao. Is that right? We are moved by your determination... ...in traveling the great distance to our shores. You must have suffered. We are sorry to have to give you more trouble. Your beliefs are all right. They are valid... ...in Spain, Portugal and other Western countries. But we ban Christianity here because... ...it's of no value to Japan. Truth should be universal. Why else would we teach it? If it's not truth in Japan... ...then neither is it truth anywhere else. AII Padres say that. But even a tree chooses its place to grow. Christianity may grow in other lands, but... ...not here in Japan. Have you ever thought of that? It should grow and bloom here! It was well known even in Europe... ...how Padres were activated in Japan. When permission was given here, the believers numbered three hundred thousand. If Christianity doesn't grow here, it is due to lack of cultivation. Why do we talk this way? My words won't be able to change your minds. Neither can yours change mine. No matter what I say, I will be executed. We don't execute you without reason. That's not Inoue's way. He would do so immediately. Why do you laugh? That is Inoue, Lord of Chikugo, sitting there. It's 300 mon. What is? You want to have me, don't you? You're funny. Where are you from? Why ask that? It doesn't matter where one is from. Are you crying? No! Whatever it is, just forget it. Such painful things aren't easy to forget. You go as low as you can, and nothing is shocking. You aren't near as far down as I am. What did you do, kill somebody? I did something worse! You want me or not? You have money? Money? Sure I've got some. Did you steal it? I sold for it. Fine! Nobody enjoys taking stolen money. Hurry up! What's wrong? Spit in my face! You're really weird! What do you mean? If you spit on me, I'll give you all my money. Or I can't forgive myself. Spit on me! You must be bored, but you'll see something. You'll be interested. Sanemon Okada and Kiku! Your last chance! I ask you again: Will you not apostatize? And you? Hey, you! What are you doing here? Get away from here! Don't loiter here! Sanemon Okada, do you still refuse? They're coming for us from Paradise. It won't be long. Padre, please listen! I want to confess! Oh, Padre! Padre! I have deceived you. Won't you listen? You made fun of me. So I hated you and the believers. I stepped on the fumi-e. I did! Mokichi and Ichizo were strong, but I'm not. Are you drunk?! What should a weak man like me do? I didn't betray you for the money. Because they threatened me. Get out! Padre, listen! I couldn't help it! Get out! I'm a Christian! Throw me in jail! Padres! Listen to my confession! I want to repent and start all over again. Please, listen, Padre! I apostatized. But if I had been born sooner... I'd have lived and died a good Christian. But I was born when Christianity is banned. How I regret it! Been a long time. I've been to Hirado. You should visit there sometimes. It has a castle and faces a peaceful bay. I heard in Macao that it is a beautiful town. Not beautiful, but most interesting. I heard an interesting story there. Lord of Hirado once had four concubines. Concubines? The four women always fought each other. The lord was troubled. What do you think he did? I don't know. He threw all of them out. Are you not interested in a story about women? I'm glad to know you agree with him. Don't you think Japan is in the same position? Spain, Portugal, Holland, England... They fight for Japan's favor like women. If you think the lord was wise, you must understand why Japan bans Christianity. We believe a man should have one wife. And a married man must get rid of other women. Japan too should choose his wife out of the four. You mean it should be Portugal? But, Padre... Why should Japan choose a foreigner? A woman of his country is best suited for him. A woman's heart is more important... ...than her nationality. But if it were only the heart that matters... ...there'd be no infidelity. The love of an unwanted woman... ...is most troublesome to any man. And such a marriage will produce no offspring. And she is barren. If she's barren, it's not the fault of the Church. It is the fault of you and your people... ...who try to separate the believers from the Church. It seems you don't know Japan very well, Padre. And it seems you don't know Christianity well. Thirty years ago, I too was taught by Padres. Still I have to forbid it. I have my own reason. It's not that I think it is heresy. Do it quickly. Your heart is free. It is only a formality. It will not harm your beliefs. Step on it, and your troubles are over. A samurai Christian! Who cares about him? Stop! Please stop! Apostatize! If you do, we'll stop the horse. You mustn't, Kiku! You mustn't! Don't look at me! Get a hold of yourself. Don't step on it! Pull him out! Kiku! I apostatize too! Listen to me! Give me a fumi-e! Take him away! I apostatize! Think carefully! The sooner you step on it, the sooner you get out. I tell you again. It is just a formality. It won't hurt your beliefs. You want the horse's hoofs, too? I'll step on it! Get out. Get up! You're leaving. Where is everyone? At the Magistrate's. You're going to see a man. He'll be here. The Magistrate's order. Do you know who? Really? Can you guess what's next? The Magistrate says that if Garrpe apostatizes, the farmers will be set free. You see, Padre. We're not after a few nameless people. Many Christian farmers are hiding all over Japan. If you Padres apostatize, they'll be saved, too. You force your own dreams on us thoughtlessly. You never think of the blood that must be shed. Like those innocent farmers. Garrpe was pure. But you're just a coward. Not a "Padre". Your name? It was Monica, but it isn't any longer. How will you live on? I don't know. What would you do, if you were me, Padre? You did all you could. The Lord will forgive you. There are no gods or Buddhas. There is nothing at all anymore. Did you hear? Another body was found on the beach. It was a Christian woman all tied up. How cruel! The officials dumped her. Even under treatment like that, they believe in their God. How pitiful! They are idiots! Duped by Padres! They asked for it. Are you crying? No! Drink! Why the tears? Were you a Christian before? No! I don't care, whether you are or not. Where are you from? What's it to you? Sold, weren't you? Yes, during the drought. It was the only way we could eat then. Want to see your folks? What for? Silly! Any brothers? Yes, a little one about this big. I wonder how he's getting along. It's a tough world! Really tough! Too tough! Do you know who you're to see? The Magistrate thinks it's time you see him. Mr. Inoue? Right. And the man wants to see you too. Don't call him Ferreira. He has taken a Japanese name: Chuan Sawano. Right, Sawano? He is working on another book. It tells of the errors in Christian teachings. The title is "Falsehoods Revealed." I'm useful here. I help the people of Japan. I introduced astronomy. I got telescopes from a Dutch ship's captain. I am of use here in this country. Sawano, we didn't bring Rodrigues here... ...for long discussions. Give him the old priest's message. They told me to urge you to apostatize. Look at this. He was tied up. He was hung by the ankles. They cut holes behind his ears. His blood trickled out and kept him alive. It was an idea of Magistrate Inoue's. I preached in this nation for twenty years. I know Japan better than you. Our religion does not take root here. This country is a swamp. You will learn that. A swamp more terrible than we considered. A swamp where any seedling planted rots. The leaves wither and the plant dies. We sowed the seeds of Christianity in it. That is not our God. It is not our God, but their own gods... ...that the people of this country believe in. We didn't realize that for a very long time. Maybe you know... The farmers worship the Kannon as Mary. They love that pagan figure more... ...than the teachings of our Lord. Probably no one will believe what I say. Not only you, but no one in all Christendom... Neither will our friends in Macao and Rome. The saint never noticed the fact. He taught them about Zeus. The Japanese changed it into their own sun god. They call it Dainichi, and it became their god. They bend and change our God into something else... Something quite different. That is all. Has anyone come to save you? Jeers from all sides. No one needs you! Come on, just say you apostatize. And you'll never go back there. To the Magistrate's. I don't want you to suffer. Just apostatize! Get out of here! I'm a Christian. I'll beat you! Who's there? A crazy one. He says he's a Christian. Padre, forgive me! I came to confess. Please forgive me! Get out! Well, are you frightened? Stop being stubborn. Take the easy way. Sawano, he thinks that's snoring. You must tell him what it really is. That is not snoring. It is the voices of believers in the pit. You were brought up immediately, but... ...they've been there for six hours already. Listen to me. Somewhere on that wall I carved some letters. "LAUDATE EUM." It should be on the wall to the right... Near the post... Try to touch it. I heard the voices here as you do now. I did not apostatize because I was hung. I was hung upside down in the pit for two days. But I did not speak a word against God. I apostatized because God had done nothing. I prayed desperately, but He did nothing. He kept silent. Pray as you like. Those believers are suffering terribly... Harder than you can ever imagine. They hung all day yesterday. Today, too. Why do they have to suffer? You can do nothing for them. God, either. The night I was here, five hung in that pit. Their voices came in together with the wind. The official said... "If you apostatize, they will be pulled out. "They will get medical treatment too." Sawano, is he ready for the fumi-e? It's a mere formality. Christianity is a forbidden heresy. Today three ships entered Nagasaki Harbor. They were loaded with silks, other cloths and two boxes of jars. We found these in the cargo of one of them. Are these forbidden Christian objects? The Magistrate has ordered you investigate these. This is not a Christian object. What do you think? I'm of the same opinion as Mr. Sawano's. The Christian chalice looks different here. Are you sure? Yes, sir. Thanks for your advice. You're dismissed. From this day forward, Sebastian Rodrigues... received the name Sanemon Okada.
