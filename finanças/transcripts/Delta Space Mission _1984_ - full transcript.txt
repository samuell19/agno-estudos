Romaniafilm presents An Animafilm production A strange mysterious, troubling world called Cosmos. A cosmic vessel is stranded due to an on-board explosion. The ship's pilot must be saved. Two young astronauts are on a rescue mission. We will follow them, and others through many unusual events. With the hope that they will become our friends. We now present Oana and Dan. We can't stay here! We must get out... Stay with the wounded, I want to try something. Hurry, Oana! It's dangerous! Delta One to Center. We have saved the pilot from K2. The ship was destroyed in the blast. We're now returning to Earth. Center to Delta One. Copy that. As Oana and Dan return home, we meet someone else. Alma, a brave and resourceful young woman. Always at her side is Tin, an alien dog, a mischievous yet loyal friend. Alma comes to Earth from a different solar system, looking to make a sensational report on the launch day of Delta Space Mission. I am Alma, intergalactic reporter from Planet Opp. I know my visit has been announced. It looks like I'm the first reporter to attend this launch. Excellent. I'm Dan, I'm a pilot. Nice to meet you. Pardon the inconvenience, but Tin must wait outside. What a cute little Tin! All Tins are cute, though they have a bad habit of chewing metals. I was chosen as your guide because I worked on the Station project. She's beautiful! It's as if she came down from heaven. We plan on searching nearby galaxies, and discovering new worlds, which we want to befriend and work with. As always, we are initiating a peaceful mission into the cosmos. An invitation to dialogue for our peers everywhere. Delta will have a long way to go, and the journey is not without danger. These are my colleagues, Oana and Yashiro, Anuta. The program commander thought that people who studied together, worked on the same team, and who would communicating to other worlds, should be very good friends. We have tried to please him. Here is our greatest achievement: The super-brain that guides the station. It's amazing! It looks like a fabulous jewel. I've never seen anything so beautiful. You can fall in love with its brightness. I hope I'm not being selfish, but I would want it all to myself. I would never get tired of looking at it. Alma, are you joking? We built this to be smart, not beautiful. The super-brain will efficiently coordinate all of Delta's actions - starting with the launch. That will allow it to fly without limits, cultivate plants, and create robots to help it in any situation. For safety reasons, the operation will have no direct human participation especially for a young reporter... - But do you have any idea of her history? She broadcasted the great eruption of the volcano on Cora live. That doesn't sound like a safe event, does it? She was also there when expedition Alpha took off for the Onyx constellation. She also participated - and not as a bystander, in the ferocious Zuri hunt on the everlasting ice of Astarte. That was after winning first place in the intergalactic high-precision weapons shooting contest. So, what do you think? You wouldn't say I'm too modest? All right. I will ask permission for you to come with us. - Thank you! Good bye! - So long! You could fall in love with that brightness. I'd like it all to myself, all mine. Here you see the antenna of the intergalactic transmitter on Earth, which enables communication with the entire Universe. Please be quiet! We are broadcasting. Planet Opp, do you copy? Transmitting from Earth. This is Alma. Requesting a unilateral circuit with breaking news priority. Earthlings are preparing to launch Space Station Delta. Mission goals: knowledge, understanding, collaboration. According to the OPO code "People for people". Message received. Please share details about the designers. Dan, station designer and space researcher. Oana, highly qualified electronic device designer. Yashiro, on-board electronics coordinator. Anuta, bio-cybernetician. Awaiting live coverage of the launch. - I will be ready. - Good bye, Alma! An important day in the science calendar of the year 3084. The super-brain is being installed and enabled on the Delta Space Station. After this final stage, the mission will be ready to begin. The operations have begun, and Alma is a part of them. The Earth transport vessel is ready. All crew at their stations. Attention, signaling lift-off! - Engaged engine twelve, optimal rotation. - Good luck to all! Direction 32. Synchronized rotation deviation 32 degrees. - Autopilot for Beta circuit. - Q signal for Beta circuit. First gear. Transport ship has made contact with station hatch. Confirmed for gate two. Prepare to connect the super-brain. Completed. Reporting assembly orders, circuit 24 to position R. Integrated block two on position zero. Attention! Attention all crew! Unidentified signal. Check guiding channel 26 immediately! All crew to interception posts! Dan and Alma are stuck inside. Circuits 1 -14 canceled. Unexpected automatic detachment. Station Delta has rejected the transport ship. Contact lost. Brightness. Alma. Mine. Incredible! Alma, the electronic brain is malfunctioning! Tin, here boy! Set Dan free! Let's fall back! Alma, this is no time to record! Start the engines! Alma. Alma, don't go! Mine. Mine. Forever. Mine. The hatches are closing. Speed up, Dan! This is Center. This is Center. Oana and Yashiro are coming to help. We have them! Orbit Z, heading zero by zero seven. Attempting rescue. Station Delta has disappeared unexpectedly, in a way that can't be understood. Meanwhile, the two crews are reunited. Emotions are running high after this wild incident. And now, we ask you to listen. The program commander is giving a speech. The malfunction was unpredictable, but we mustn't be discouraged. The electronic super-brain is built according to completely new principles, and it can program itself. Therefore, it could have been influenced in ways we do not yet understand. We have one option. Recover Station Delta at all costs. Contact all crews and friends on other planets requesting they give notice of any peculiar events happening nearby. We must be prepared for the Station to act in unexpected and dangerous ways. Despite all efforts, Delta was nowhere to be found. Until one day when Alma was having fun taking photos of Tin. Tin, smile! Don't move! One more time! That's it! Tin, you're so cute! Hurry up, Tin! We're leaving. Alma to Center. Please respond! Something strange is happening. A stone monster! I don't know where it came from. I'll take a closer look. Broadcasting images for you to see. It's trying to get me! I don't understand! I'm leaving so I don't get caught. Stay calm, you are not alone. We will move in at once. To the entire interception team. There is a stone giant in quadrant T 163. Ordering its destruction. This is the vessel Commander. Please confirm the coordinates of the objective. Vessel Three. Heading six eight. Vessel Five. Heading three seven, near Vessel Two. Target spotted. Target destroyed. Attention, Center! A new attacker with massive destructive power! It has found me in the city. The city has been warned. Head to evacuation areas S and H - S and H. Sending footage. Squadron M20. Sectors S and H are compromised by the wave. Destroy the creature! Target spotted. We're closing in. Target destroyed. A third apparition. Incredible! Unbelievable! With a holographic antenna for long-distance communication. - Look out, it's jamming my autopilot! - Switch to manual, immediately! Tin, stay! Target is difficult to destroy! - I've been hit! Explosion! - Full speed ahead! Progress due North! Attention! The target must not approach the city's electrical plant! Dan and Oana, the computer shows a bio-transfer machine on the beach. We don't know how it got there, or who enabled it. It created the monsters! I'm sure of it, it created them! Find it and destroy it! Heading 1050 plus nine. I repeat, 1050 plus nine. Delay the antenna's access to the plant, until the machine is neutralized! Dan to Commander: We're closing in on the source of the action signal. Signal position acquired. We're landing. The antenna is getting closer to the plant! Danger! It's emitting a dangerous plasma discharge! The bio-transfer machine has been neutralized. For now, the earthlings didn't realize the connection between Station Delta and the monsters who were trying to capture Alma. Or, if they did realize such a connection, they kept it to themselves. Now the reporter is preparing to leave, regretting she missed the story that brought her to Earth. Tin, we're leaving Earth in the morning. We're going back home, boy. Farewell, Alma! - Goodbye! - You're welcome back anytime! Lane four ready for takeoff. Good trajectory, maintain heading two. Farewell, Alma! Passing through the asteroid belt. Thanks for everything. Goodbye everyone! Alma's ship glides over the unusual planet Acora. But somewhere in space, Delta is watching - or maybe, stalking her. Alma calling Earth. Control center, do you copy? I have surprising news! I've found Station Delta! I don't understand this game of hide and seek! Maybe you can figure it out. Broadcasting images. A surprise, or maybe not. Determine its position. Stay on the line. - I am close to the planet Acora. - Stay in the area. Mine. Mine! Forever! HQ to patrol module. Dan and Yashiro, do you copy? Please respond. This is patrol module. As suspected, Delta has appeared near Alma again. Form a commando group, protect Alma, and recover the Station. - That's an order! - Understood. In love. Brightness. Alma. Alma to HQ. Help! Delta has built interceptors and sent them after me! Dan and Yashiro are headed your way. My ship is damaged! Detaching service module and descending on Acora! Try to hang on! I'm taking cover among the rocks. Finally, I got away! Alma, come in! Alma, this is Control center. Come in! Alma, come in! This is Control center. Alma, come in! This is Control center. Alma, come in! Alma, come in! This is Control center. This is Control center. Alma, come in! Alma! This is Control center. Come in! Yashiro and Dan, we've lost communication with Alma's module. Attempt direct contact. Copy that. Attempting contact. Alma! This is Control center. Come in! This is Alma. I've crashed into the marshes of Acora. The module is damaged. Over. Caution! Acora's swamps and jungle are a level five threat. Closing in on Acora. We can't make a connection with Alma. Look for her in Quadrant Y452. Hurry! Caution! Acora's swamps and jungle is a level five threat. There is nothing as stubborn as an automated robot. And the robots built and sent to capture Alma were programmed to be relentless. The reporter's only hope until Yashiro and Dan arrived, was to take refuge in the crimson jungle, where other dangers awaited her. Tin, settle down! This is the end Tin! We are surrounded! But Tin couldn't miss the chance to prove itself, especially after deducing that the robots have a base camp they launch their attacks from. And this is what happened. We're sweeping quadrant 452 concentrically. We'll find her. - So you had the solution? - No way! I was stimulated by your humor. Laugh at me while you can. I'll see your face when we assault the Station. It looks like... Yes! There's Alma's ship, right there! And over there, the service module. Well done! You did this by the book! Let the Center know, and we'll go down. Listen here, pal. Do you lose yourself when you get a compliment? - Why? - You call this a landing? You slammed into the module like a punching bag! - You're too sensitive! - Not me. It's the air scanner. You broke it! It was already damaged from the asteroids. That's fine. We'll take the filtering helmets. Let's go. Those are gunshots! Ha ha ha. This is not a very warm welcome! Don't tell me you're afraid! - Look out, Dan! - In front of you, Yashiro! Is it just me, or are they retreating? They are retreating, you're right. - Let's get Alma, quick! - What is this? Ah! - They caught her in an energy net! - Deactivate the net! - Dan, Yashiro! I didn't recognize you! - What's going on here? As you can see, the robots keep savagely attacking. It's so good you're here! - Did you hear? - What was that? An explosion! Tin, did you have anything to do with this? What a disaster! The robots are ahead of us! Nasty business. We also lost our connection to Earth. A restless night. With no protection, and unable to complete their mission, the three try to remain calm and find a solution. Curse this uncertainty! Couldn't we sleep in the module, even if it is damaged? The intact compartments are full of equipment and provisions, which we must preserve at all costs. Will we make it until help comes? We'll have issues with the filtering helmets. Luckily, Alma is biologically adapted to any atmosphere. I'm thinking... Tell us, Alma, what happened to your module? I left it in the swamp. It was unresponsive. Well, let's sleep on it. Tomorrow I'll tell you how we can get out of here. Sleep well. - Good morning, Yashiro. - So, how do we get out of here? Definitely not on our ship. - True. But Alma's module is intact. - It's sunk in a swamp up to its cockpit. Maybe I can bring it out, somehow. Hmm. Good luck. With support like that, there's no way I can fail! Tin, show Yashiro the way to the module. Go to the module, Tin! Do you see how we could bring it out of here? I have an idea. Ha ha, are you thinking what I'm thinking? Well then, let's give it a try! Here, help me. While Yashiro and Tin try to make their ideas work, Alma and Dan salvage all they can from the damaged ship. There's plenty of activity all around. Including the enemy. We've managed something, at least. Dan! Your helmet! What happened to you? Can you breathe? Thankfully, it turns out the air here is not toxic. Where's Alma? What happened? What usually happens around here, that's what happened! The robots. - We held them off as best we could. - And what about Alma? You should have seen her fighting! But the robots did not play fair. They threw another energy net on her. That's all I know. I can't remember anything after they broke my helmet. Look! Look there! The robot transporter! The kidnappers are taking Alma away. This could be good - if we act now! - Using her module. You are incredible! - If only we can get it ready in time! Are you convinced that Delta could destroy us? Not convinced. But I'm afraid it might. I can't take any chances until I find out what happened to Delta's brain. And what about the laws of cybernetics? To protect mankind in all circumstances? Do you feel like Delta has protected us? Either way, it could have taken us out a long time ago. I think it's playing, in a way. But I can't understand its game. For now. - Did you bring Tin aboard? - Of course, he's back there. He misses Alma. There's our beloved Station. Yes. As usual, greeting us with interceptors. That's its game, isn't that what you said? Playing cat and mouse. So Delta is the mouse? You're too quick to laugh, again. Maneuver! Listen up! Shoot the hatch! It's about time we got captured. What do you think? I agree. How else are we going to get inside? Alma! Welcome, Alma! Alma, never leave again! What a lovely thing to say! As if I could leave. Welcome! Alma. You once said I am beautiful and that you would want me to be yours forever. I don't understand! Something does not compute. And that troubles me. So that's what it was! This is why you malfunctioned! On that day, I... Oh! You're using strange words. I don't have them in my programs, and I want them. I would like them. I did say you were beautiful, and you truly are. But do you know why? Because you are a work created by a group of people. Maybe you're a masterpiece. Then I am perfect, and therefore, better than them. Never! Simply because they created you. And I am happy to have met them. Dan, Yashiro, Anuta, Oana. I came to Earth alone, now I'm leaving friends behind there. Two of them I have in my hands. You're mistaken! I will prove to you that they are in my hands. Truly, Dan and Yashiro are harmless. But that was part of their plan. They got captured to deceive the super-brain's vigilance, which was already bothered by its inability to understand Alma. Thus, they are giving Tin an opportunity, as he has been trained in advance, to destroy the power system of the great computer. You two. Stay where you are. With pleasure. Have a seat, dear Yashiro. Tin, boy, it's time. Everyone forgot about you, but the success of this mission depends on you. Alma. Listen to me. Listen to what? Your circuits are broken. I will take you to a wonderful planet. Who would have guessed? We built a sentimental braggart of a computer. My planet has a name: Home. A dreamy planet, that I miss dearly. Dream. Alma. Dream. The same words. Words that belong only to people. That's why you will never understand. Listen. Dream. Wish. Thought. Joy. Love. Smile. Children. Hope. Poems. Mother. Miracle. Happiness. Peace. Stop. It's too fast. It's too much! - I was not programmed... - Those things can't be programmed, robot! I feel sorry for you. Very sorry. You are sorry. These words. These words. It must be terrible, to know you can never be human. And I'm sure it understood this. The electronic brain will surely be fixed. Its programs and activities will safeguard the peace and quiet that every world needs. Mankind's dream has always been for science to preserve life. Because without life, planets wither and die under a no-man's sky. The End
