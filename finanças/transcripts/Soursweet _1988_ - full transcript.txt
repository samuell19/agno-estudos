As for distribution, last month the police picked up two of our men. I'd like your permission torecruit expendable runners, not our own people. Perhaps we could usepeople with gambling debts. Too obvious. Hey, Chen. How's your son, OK? Good. He's a handsome little fellow. Mm-hmm. Bad news from home? Uh, no, good news. Very good news. Everything is fine. When he was a young man,everyone in Guangxi Province knew his name. He was the greatest fighter of his day. Three years in a row, he waschampion at the tournament. He taught mama to be a fighter too. He wanted me to be a boy, you see. And at our wedding, when hewas a very old man of 70 years, he smashed open a big winejar with his head like this.

Not many tigers left in Enden. And I'm still very supple. Look. Wonderful. Your sister is quite wonderful. No brothers. So father used to make Lily train very hard. But not right for girl, really. Well, how is your little campaign? Are you going to shift him? How's the soup tonight, Chen? Not too salty? You like it then? Yes, I like it. I do so much cooking. I ought to be doing it for a living. Mrs. Law was saying today how Chinese people are good at business. Chen, we are wasting life. Let's start a business now. No. But Chen, that's what we came for. We owe it to son. You know and I knowfamilies never stand still. They rise or fall. We got to start. This is not the right time. No restaurant, no takeawaycounter, and no business. And no more talk about it. [background chatter] You should have been braver. [background chatter] Let me keep your money, uncle. I can count it for you.

That's really bad. There are nasty peoplecollecting gambling debts. I'll see what I can do, uncle. I'll tell you what, I know some people. No. Thank you. Don't get the wrong idea, uncle. These are good Chinesepeople who stick together to observe the old ways. Always ready to help. You know how to give face,bring fruit, pour tea, all that old fashioned shit. I'll find out for you, uncle. Don't worry. We'll help your old man out. You'll see. Chen, are you awake? Are you angry with me? No. Is there something wrong? Something you're worried about? No, I'm not worried. If there is, you would tell me. Promise? Promise. [inaudible], fat boy. [background chatter] Ready? Remember what I told you. Sirs. Our friendship associationis always pleased to help those who know how to show respect. You do well to think of your father, Mr. Chen. Venerate your parents. Be filial. Be loyal to your friends and brothers. It is clear that your fathermust recover his honor and we will be pleased togive money for that purpose. Uncle is being most generous. You're too kind to amiserable servant, uncle. But what about repayments? The interest? Not in front of uncle. Yes. Give the fruit to our kids. Next. CHEN: You know, this really isn't the time. You know, to make a move, go into business. I might be wrong, of course. But I think I'm right. I know I'm right. We need to choose ourmoment, not rush into things. You ought to consider this thing more carefully, mother of Man Kee. When you have a family, you can't afford to take stupid risks. Look before you leap. Waste all my time with theseimpossible ideas, really. When I'm all tired out from working all day in the restaurant. Don't you think I havebetter things to think about? We've got all the money we need. You got all the clothes you need. Man Kee's well fed. There's nothing wrong with this furniture. Nothing at all. We are perfectly happy as we are. Everyone envies us. Can you find a betterflat than this in London? We got everything, right? So I don't want to hearanother word about starting up our own business. I'm tired of listening to it. You hear? Not another word. Not another word on the subjectof starting our own business or getting out of this flat, getting rich. Where is it? Where's what? Our new business. Where is it? I don't know. The Hong Kong Societiesare descended from the Canton branch of the second lodge. And our old society is the oldest of these. We represent the old and true way, a way which has almost vanished. Now, there is another morerecent organization which calls itself a Hong Society. It is called 14K. This gang calls itself a Hong Society, but they are nothing more thancriminals, thugs, street kids. They care nothing for theordinary decencies of life. They have no organizationin our sense. But they are hungry and ambitious. So on becoming ordinarymembers after initiation, you will attain the 49 rank. The code and signsversus a numerical system will be explained to you then. Leave in small groups and avoid attention. Little brother. [inaudible] Chang. My friends want you to know that everything has been taken care of. Your only father has settled his debts. Everyone thinks highly of him again. He even has a littleextra to spend on himself. Your relatives are all veryimpressed by you, very proud. Fok. My friends have done you a big favor, uncle. Now we expect one in return. Fok, you're a very kind man. I can pay you extra money. Money? Who needs money? Do I look like a poor man? I didn't help you for money. That wasn't the idea. I need a favor, uncle. A favor. [inaudible] You think we can go back to the [inaudible] jokes with you, uncle? Serious business, uncle. Very serious business. What do you-- what do you want me to do? It'll be very easy for you. We want some deliveries made. Once a week to Sheffield. Very simple. You can go on the train. Do it on your day off. Think it over. Get used to the idea. You'll be good at it. No one will notice someone like you. [crying] Man Kee, stop doing that. [banging] MOVER: All right. [distant singing] Chen, you have nevercooked a meal in your life. It Won't be Chinese cuisine, Lily. It's takeaway food. The English like it. I don't need to know anything about cooking. LILY: So out of the way,nobody will know we're here. That's good. We don't want too much business at first. We need to get used to things. Build it up slowly. [music playing] ANNOUNCER: The train now[inaudible] 5:22 46 Bedford.

[whistles] It's true. Only a few type of faces. No expression. And it's all pink skin, like pigs. And big clumsy faces and empty, empty eyes. When I first became a waiter, I have to remind myself thatthey are not really ghosts. [laughs] They are real, just like us. Of course they are. And all those young girls buying dinners when they should be at home. No wonder they get themselves pregnant. And they age so quickly. All of a sudden they arewomen and nothing in between. Very funny skin. They're not ghosts. They're not white skinned pigs either. The You take some trouble, youlook at them, and some of them have lovely eyes. There are lots ofdifferent kinds of faces. But you don't even look at them. You just take their money. You watch English people, younger sister. You see. They're not pigs. They got feelings just like everybody else. [laughter] - Are you ready? - Yeah. Go! Chen. Where do you and son go to play? In the park, on the swings and slides. But I don't twist him on the swing. It's dangerous. It could make him sick. What are you talking about, fat boy? OK twist someone on the swing. Doesn't matter really. We don't do it anyway. I want you to enjoy yourself. You promise me? you won't go on the waste ground. You might cut yourselfwith all that broken glass. It's OK. It's safe here. Safe. It's safe here. Show me what you dowhen you know the answer. In class, you're always quiet.

You thought you were goingto keep this a secret? No. Why did you do it? Why did you do it? Do it? Do it? You're not interested in who, are you? Only where and when. How many men did it? Come on, come on. Mr. Con's looking. Come on. Come on. Does the father know? He doesn't know. Are you going to tell me who? Do you? Do you? I do not want to tell you. Well, as you like. All right. He's gone. [crying] [music playing] How beautiful. Come. Truly beautiful. How you girls have worked hard. Really, this is quite charming. Do you really carry on businessin this delightful room? Yes. I can hardly believe it. This is the counter where we serve the food. And brother-in-law, he built the benches. What consummate skill. When it's crowded, peoplestand against the wall. Of course, I have to clean the marks off. And Lily got the calendar free. How refined. And Mrs. Law, the cash till. The lucky cash till. It rings when you total the cash. [cash register rings] And we got it secondhand froma sweet shop, didn't we, Lily? You have to push the drawer back yourself. Oh, how confidently you worksuch a complicated machine, Miss Tran.

Don't mention you ever see me, OK? Don't tell anyone where I am. What's the matter, Chen? You owe the boss money? [laughs] I won't tell. I won't say a thing. [background chatter] [screaming] [sirens] [panting] Bastard! Not exactly a success. We hit them hard, so let'snot start calling it a defeat. Of course, if we have in facteliminated their leadership. Who can tell? A man gets up and I kill him. Unfortunately, we now have open warfare. This can only be bad for business. All business. Worse. The authorities are going to be interested. I had to get my men out of there. Naturally. I'm not criticizing your leadership. Merely indicating the situation before us. I take it we need not fearimmediate retaliation. Correct. I'm concerned about the quality of some of our new recruits. He has brought in useful couriers for us. A waiter we lend money to who is now on a weekly run to Sheffield. And there are others. I do not presume to command. [music playing] Your mother led an honorable life. She always wanted to see her grandson. Now she never will. [laughter] But don't forget, the English don't like too many foreigners here. He's an old man. To them an extra mouth to feed. The laws are very strict. They might say no. He is an old man and he hasthe right to come here and eat as much as he wants and be honored by his daughter-in-law and grandson, who he has never seen. Just because the English can't look after their own oldpeople, that doesn't mean that we can't look after ours. Don't shout at her, Lily. She doesn't make the laws. You know, we could do this. I've got a present for you. Close your eyes and hold out your hand. Thank you. Where did you find such a beautiful thing? My secret. A precious stone. I'm a very lucky man. [inaudible] More chips. More chips. [phone rings] You've got chips. [inaudible] Yes. LILY: [inaudible] Yes. [screams] You think you can run away,uncle, when you borrowed money? You think everyone'sgoing to forget about you? What are you going to do, uncle? I'll tell you. You're going to pay it back to me. [music playing] [inaudible] [laughs] Well? A handsome boy. In my world, he's a handsome boy. Look at that head. It's enormous. It is a big head. Plenty of brains in there. Get him lot of fish head and chicken head too. He will be rich, a big businessman. [laughs] [music playing] [phone ringing] Yes? Yes. Bad boys. Bad boys. I want you to imagine it is my father who is speaking to you now. Son, this is a first. Now, do it yourself. Good. The other hand. Clever boy. Put your fist under your armpit. Higher. Bend your knees a little. Slowly stick your arm out and turn the wrist over as you give fist. Leave the other one where it is, like this. All right? Do it. OK. Do it fast. The other hand. Again. Harder. The other hand. Again. Now, hit mama's hand. OK, again. Harder. The other hand. Again. Harder. Faster. Harder. All right. I will show you how to kick. You use the edge of your foot. Aim for shin or knee cap. You put your hand in front of your face where you kick to stop bad boy's fist. Now kick mama. Harder. Again. Honor the memory of your grandfather. If someone hurt you, nevershow it on your face. Understand? - Well? - I can't believe it. He's not there. He left suddenly. Nobody knows where. How much did he take? I check with Sheffield. In six months, perhaps as muchas 200 grams showed weight. Miserable runner. It shouldn't be hard to find him. I'm making this man's deathyour personal responsibility. Find him and wash him. A little more investigationmight be appropriate. Might it? When you recoup widelyin the way you have here, problems arise. Problems of quality. [glass shatters] It's as we thought. I spoke to the owner of the Happy Garden. That runner left a long timeago without giving notice. That man Fok must have beendealing the stuff himself. It's always the same. No doubt he's been puttingthe squeeze on the waiter too. No point in trackinghim down if he's innocent. You're still under the leader's orders. Should there be a miscarriage ofjustice, he'll be responsible. It's a trifling error, but it could be useful. Now, to business. Can I rely on you? Of course. And I speak for other side as well. Good. Don't be confused by old loyalties. In a successful business,one is sometimes forced to make redundancies. Trouble with the teacher. Is that it? Because you hit a bad boyand made his nose bleed? And the bad girl. They hit you first. Why is teacher angry? Teacher says I do dirty fighting. Dirty? Teacher says only a coward kicks in the leg and hits over head. Huh? Teacher says it's dirty fighting. What does she mean dirty? Unfair. Unfair. Unfair? What's fair about fighting? The whole idea is to win. It's an insult to the way of the fist. Look. Look at this. Look. You fill his head with your stupid nonsense and he got hit again. The way of the fist? You know nothing about the real world. People are pushed around and hurt. They get killed. My son is having nothing to do with it. Nothing. Keep your stupid tradition to yourself. Do you understand? [singing] Yoohoo. Come on. Sit next to me. Come on. All right? [inaudible]. If you kill him, you'llforce us into all out war. Listen, my friend. It's easy enough for you to go in here. But we could make itharder for you to come out. Understand? Good. Everything is in order, [inaudible]. The takings are in the safe? The men have just reported to me-- I told you to take it yourself. Now do it and come back here. You're all needed across the road. [music playing] [gunshots] [inaudible] [screaming] [baby crying] You can bring it home. It can share Man Kee's room. She. Chen says it. She's welcome in our house. It's better for her to stay here. Mrs. Law has been very kind. Man Kee's not goodenough to share with niece? Don't talk like that, Lily. She's a girl. A maggot in the rice. You have a son. There's no place for a girl in your family. I want the best life for her. Don't you understand what I'm telling you? Mrs. Law's rich. And she's kind. And she's also lonely. But it's your baby. Don't you want to be with her? Aren't you going to miss her? Yes. I want to be with her. I'm going to miss her. I want to be with her. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Why don't you want me to see her? I don't know. Lily. The father is from Belgium. This is my new country, also my last country. No more different places. So, it is lucky to honor my English host and say thank you for taking ina weak old man from Hong Kong. Where are we going to find a pig? How are you going to teachthe English to play mahjong? Who needs pig or mahjong? Just a little to eat and a drink. They will be happy, you see. Grandpa, no one will understand you. No need. No need. We are old. We have seen all. There no need to talk. What are we going to give them to eat? Old English people won't like Chinese food. Even real Chinese food. [inaudible] [laughter] Tell my English friends it'stime to go out into garden now. I've got something to show them? What is it? No. Tell me. Please come to the garden. Something special to see. [applause] Say welcome to my [inaudible]. Honorable friends, welcome. [applause] They are not here to get cold,drink tea, and use the toilet, but for a very important purpose. We hope you all enjoyed the banquet. [applause] We are all very, very old. [inaudible] people who will not be much longer. And we wish you long life. Some of us might die tomorrow. Very long life. It's time make my arrangement for dying. Grandpa. Uh, we hope you all come again soon. [murmuring] Tell them I'm a carpenter. I've built something that we'll all need. Grandpa is a carpenter and he built something special for all of youand he hopes it will be useful. [gasping] Very good wood. Very good wood. [singing] Don't be shy. Don't be shy. Don't be shy. [screams] No. Why can't you leave me alone,you stupid, stupid, stupid. What is it? What is it big boy? Tell me. Please. You can tell me. Please. Chen. Chen. Chen, the Chinese school. There's room for Man Kee. We can take him there next Saturday and he can start straight away. What? No. Why not? I don't want him or you orany of us going into Chinatown. Tell me why. Because I don't want it. Is this it? No? Nothing? Don't want to? Are you ever going to speak to me again? More than three words? Did we come all this way to start a business so you can turn into vegetable? So you could spend everyspare moment in this garden? So you can turn my son intoa peasant, a [inaudible]? [music playing] You could have planted it again. Step back a little. It's dangerous. CHEN: Lily, Take Man Kee and go home quickly. Chen. What's happening to you? Chen. Don't talk to me. Do what I say. Go quickly. Go! Just go! [music playing] [crying] I trust you are feeling somewhat better. The attack on me was an outrage. An insult to our society. Everyone knows it. There is no open warfare betweenourselves and Jackie Fung. We win or we are finished. That's not how we see it. They knew exactly who they wanted. We heard it from Jackie Fung himself. There were only interested in you. Going behind my back to talk to this? [spits] What has happened to discipline here? No one went behind your back. You were in hospital, severe injury. It would have been dangerousfor us to talk to you. The family home that's not wish to get involved in a pointless war through the folly andarrogance of an individual. To speak bluntly, whatuse is a cripple enforcer? My friend, you no longerhave the ability to manage the situations you create. From now, the policy will be to divide territories and live in peace with our competitors. With respect, I think weshall all benefit greatly. You see? Your errors when not onlyin the military sphere. For example, this friend that you ordered washed was innocent. He was set up by this useful man of yours, one of your new recruits. He's already been washed? This could do us incredible harm, and you are solely to blame. [inaudible] Man's wife has interesting connections. Her father was [inaudible]Ching from [inaudible] village. The recruit Fok can be made use of. They want revenge for the man killed by us. The waiter's widow must be supported. You must promise me this. It will be done. A small regular paymentcould easily be sent, perhaps through our Amsterdam contacts. But gentlemen, let's not be gloomy. This is the celebration. We are conferring on elder brother, the elevated double flower prefix. Tonight he [inaudible] status. Good fortune in Hong Kong. Let's all drink to that. [inaudible] [music playing] [inaudible]. Amsterdam. He must have a restaurant job there. What makes you so sure our Chen sent the money? Who else is going to send it? He knew the business was not making enough. Not enough to look afterMan Kee when he gets older. And he's a true father tomake a sacrifice like this. But why isn't there a letter? Well, don't you see? He knew that I would try to stop him going. And he knows I'll ask him to come back. [inaudible]. I got some good news too. I'm going to get married. To Mr. Lo. Mister? Mr. Lo? That's good. What a surprise. What a happy occasion. And we're going to open up a business. A fish and chip shop. Lily, come and live with my family. LILY: I'll be all right. You'll see. MUI: There'll be a place for you whenever you want it in our house. LILY: I'll be fine. I will. [sniffs] LILY [VOICEOVER]: My dearestone, I'm so glad you are safe. Your money arrives regularly now and it makes me proud to think how we Chinese know how to look after our own. I know that one day soonyou will send me an address. I love you dearly, more and more each day, and I look forward to thetime when you return, which I know in my heart you will. In the meantime, I want you to know that I feel strong, like a warrior. And light. So light. [singing in chinese]
