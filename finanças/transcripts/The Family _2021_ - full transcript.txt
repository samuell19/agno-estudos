We want your treasure! We want your treasure! Come here! Dad, when is our vacation over? I don't know. Let's just make the most of it. On three! 1, 2, 3... Go! 1, 2, 3... Go get the ball! - Are you ready? - Go on, give me all you got! The other way, Dad! Go on, sweetie, go on! That doesn't count. Come on, kid. He's eliminated! No-one plays as well as he does! Ready? Want to go to bed? Brush your teeth and beddy-byes? Suits me. I give up. 4, 5, 6... - Write to Grandma. - I've done my life line. Go on, write to Grandma. You'll live for 120 years! Dear Alexandra... - That's not it. - No? A cock's spur or a rocky spur... Mom! Mom! - We're climbing trees tomorrow. - No way. - Why? - You know why. - Aunty said so. - Nour! Did you say they'd go tree climbing? I said: "Maybe if it's sunny." Ask us first, please! It doesn't matter. Simon and I will stay. But Mom, it's for kids. I know, but even during the vacation, I can't let you do dangerous things. It's not my fault. It's not up to me. Come here. It doesn't matter. We'll go to the pool, we'll eat ice cream... He does that every day. Oh, Jules... Listen, I don't think tree climbing is for you. I think you're too small. You'll be scared up there. You'll get dizzy on those walkways. It's not for you. - It's like Spiderman. - Well, Spiderman isn't my responsibility. Are you mad at me? No, you're not. Don't worry. I never do fun stuff. Let him do it. Yeah! Go on. 1, 2... Yes, thanks, it's working. What's he doing? - Ladies and gentlemen... - What are you doing, Max? Don't worry. I'd like to say a few words to... the person who shares my life... Nour. It means "light". And she is my guiding light. So... So, today, we've been married for 7 years. - Today? - Yes. Sorry. Anyway... At our wedding, Driss and Anna gave us a crazy surprise. Stop it. - A high-level choreography! - No! Stop that, Max! It was insane. And I'd really like them this evening... to do it again, if that's OK with you. You'll see, they're our very own Patrick Swayze and Jennifer Grey! Give 'em a big hand! Go on, Dad! We haven't done it in 7 years! Thank you. Wow, thank you. It's magic! Anna couldn't decide whether to become a dancer or to do a Master's in something or other. It's the Bolshoi's loss! Come on! THE FAMILY Time to wake up, Simon. Come on, kid. Come on, it's time. There you go. Come on. Do you want toast or cereal? Cereal. Have you already left? Let me know when you're leaving. We'll stay here for a while before we go. I don't want him to see you when you go tree climbing. Yeah. See you later at the pool. Yeah, have fun. See you. Lord Jesus... You who are the way, the truth, and the life, You who purify us with your word of truth, You who make us better know and love our heavenly Father, we ask You to bring Your help that we may come without fail to the true life. When will they be here? They'll be here soon. Want me to teach you something? Know the East Indian stroke? - Know who invented it? - Yes. Who? - The Indians. - Nope! Ninjas did! I'll show you. It's an extremely silent stroke. You go ever so slowly... The water doesn't stir. Everything's calm. And when you approach... "ON"! Not "ON", that would makes an "on" noise." - An "on" noise ? - It's "AN". - That makes the "an" sound. - "An"? There you go. - Watch me, Mom. - OK, I'm watching. That's great. Come on. Come in. Hello, Anna. Hello, Simon. Come on in. Take a seat. You've grown! I'll talk to them, then I'll talk to you. OK. I'm glad to see you. - See you later. - OK, Mom. - Say goodbye to Nabila. - Goodbye, Nabila. - See you later, Simon. - Bye. Give me your hand. I was so pleased to get a postcard from Simon. Was it your idea? No, he wanted to write it. Let's go to the mall and get you a new jacket for school. - Say goodbye. - Goodbye. See you later. Have fun. - I'll bring him back at 6, OK? - Fine. - Bye, sugar. - Bye. He looked happy. He said he can swim well now. He was proud to tell his dad he can put his head underwater. Yes, that was no mean feat, but he got there in the end. He's a lot braver now. He's more self-confident. That's good. Very good. Simon is happy, intelligent, with a solid emotional base. And we maintained links with his dad, so we've done a good job, Anna. This will help us move on to the next step. I'm telling you this because Mr. Carneiro wrote to the judge to say that he wants his son to go back to live with him. He wanted me to read his letter. It's very good, very clear. Eddy's approach is well thought out. The judge will want to check his motives and his ability to look after his son. We'll take things slowly. He'll start with outings and stays, to be extended to weekends and vacations. Do you think he's capable of it? Eddy hit rock bottom after his wife's death, but he saw losing custody of Simon as unfair. I've seen him fight for 5 years, especially with himself, to prove to us he could raise his son on his own. He's been very brave. So, he deserves a chance. I told Simon he'd see his dad more regularly. It'll be hard for him to express his feelings. You'll have to be attentive. His dad is like an uncle he sees once a month, so Simon must understand that from now on, he'll play a real role. I wasn't expecting that. You took in Simon when he was 18 months old, so it's normal to feel emotional. Don't worry, we're used to it. I'll support you. Where will you be when I'm at Dad's at the weekend? I'll be at home, waiting for you. Who'll take me to church? Your dad will. He wanted me to take you, so you'll be able to go with him. It'll be your time. He'll be pleased. Who'll be able to sleep in on Sunday mornings? I will! Hallelujah! Hey, don't worry. Look... Who looks after you right now? Well? Is it me? So, everything's fine. Take your jacket. Let's go. Come on. She works for a firm that makes role-playing games. Hey! - You OK? - Fine. - Hi there. - How did it go? His dad doesn't like him... No, we never said that and he didn't abandon him. He was sad and couldn't look after him, that's all. Can't he just come over for coffee? - Isn't that enough? - No, it's not. In his dad's house, will he have his own room? Yes, I suppose so. So, when he goes, I can have his room. What? I just want... When he goes... - That's not the issue. - It's not. Hey! - What? - Look, it's not the issue. I'll get his room... Look, we don't have the room. I have to provide a room for Simon. That's how it is. When he's gone, then. - We get the message. - We sure do. What a vulture. - I'm not a vulture! - Adri! Seriously. I mean it. He's goading me. Adri! Dad... What does a vulture look like? It's like an eagle, but it has no feathers here. Its neck is bald. We saw one at the zoo. That's right. You have a good memory. Simon, come here. It's great your dad wants to spend time with you. It'll be great. At first, it may seem strange, but after a while... Enough! Come back here. - Enough! - Come finish your dinner, Jules. - Sit down. - Do the ghost winky. - Not now. - Please! - Go on! - The ghost winky! - Go on! - Go on. No laughing. No laughing, I said. I said, no laughing. I am the ghost winky... who comes out of his hidey-hole... all big and bloated like... Michelin Man! To do... to do... to do... to do... to do... To do what? To peepee! Peepee! Peepee! We've found a solution. I'll put a partition in his room. Really? It's not very difficult. I'll manage. How was his dad? I don't know. Better... We don't know if the judge will agree. - Huh? - No. Why didn't they even consult us? Don't we count? It won't be easy to get them to bed tonight. I think it's all a bit rushed. Don't worry, it's not done yet. The wall to over there is the limit. You can't cross it. Please, Adrien, don't! Hey! Bedtime. What on earth is going on? - This is his wall. - Look! Stop shouting. Have you said your prayers? So, go to bed. Go say your prayers, and off to bed. That's supposed to be my new room! It won't go there. No way. The partition wall will go like this. We'll see how it works out. Give me a kiss and go to bed. It's late. 'Night, little fella. Hail Mary, full of Grace... Two and a half meters. What're you doing? Why are you on your own? Go play with your brother. When will Simon be back? Same as last week. He's back on Sunday evenings, not Saturdays. Gotta get used to it. Come in if you're cold. They're all load-bearing walls, but we put in a steel beam. You put it here? Yes, all the way along. We could have knocked down this wall. Some neighbors did that. Well, it's great. It opens up the room. She decided the minute she saw it. It was the first thing I wanted to take out. - We should do the same thing. - It's a big job though. Can I take a photo? Be my guest. If we want it to be ready for when the baby comes... - You're pregnant? - Yes. - Great. - 3 months. - Well done. - Congratulations. That's super. We've just started telling people. - You'll see... - So, we got the house. After a while, it starts to show... Alright? Is everything going OK? We'll be going. No, don't worry. How about a coffee? Sit down. I insist. I'll be right back. Put him on. How's it going, kid? That's nothing. You're coming back tomorrow, sweetie. Don't get into such a state. It's just that your dad doesn't know how to play yet. You need to tell him. What games are in your room? Well, it doesn't matter. Go outside. Look, it's a nice day. There must be a park. Isn't there a park nearby? Jules isn't here, honey. He's gone out. Driss sends lots of kisses. Lots of kisses, kid. Everything's fine. Put your dad back on. Yes. Here we are. Adri, come say hello. Lucie and Pascal are our new neighbors. Nice to meet you. Maybe... Do you have a bike or something? Well, what you could do is... Can you cook at all? He loves cakes. Well, that's great. I can give you a recipe. Who is it? Who? What's in your fridge? Any eggs? I'll give you a recipe. Got a pen and paper? - Who's Mom talking to? - Nobody. - Where's your brother? - No idea. Well, you should know. He looks so like you. Well, I carried this one! Hey there! How are you doing? - 'Evening. - 'Evening, Nabila. He looks OK. He wants to show his new light saber to the boys. Where are they? Jules is with the Vasseurs. I don't know about Adri. - Can I go? - OK. Won't you tell us first? Apparently it went well. He's so excited. No news, then! Tell them to be home for dinner. OK. He phoned to say Simon was feeling down. I know. I told him he should stop calling you. It doesn't bother us. We can see he feels the need, so... Simon must understand that when he's at his dad's, he should reassure him, not you. OK. Eddy said it would help if Simon stopped calling you "Mom". It's never been a problem. You never said... It came naturally to him. Yes, I understand. He never called you "Dad"? No, but... Why didn't you tell us at the start? I'm not blaming you. We're adjusting. It's only natural. Between last week and this weekend, things are getting better. OK... We have to do this. It's difficult for everyone. But we'll make sure it doesn't drag on. You know what? I think it'd be great for you and your family, when Simon's away, to foster another child who needs some distance from his family unit. I know quite a few, I can assure you. You could use your energy to... I won't tell Simon I'm replacing him when his back's turned. No-one will tell him that. We'll just say you're doing your job with other children. He'll understand. Excuse me. Yes. Absolutely. It's as of Tuesday. That's not what was agreed. That's why it was mentioned. Now then... You guys must have hit it hard. You must have hit it real hard. Think it'll work? - Yes. - I hope so. - I hope so, too. - I'm sure it'll work. Because when I fix something... I do it for real. Let's try it. OK, I just need to check something. Dad! Turn it back on! Where are you? Join me on the dark side. - Where are you? - I see him! Hurry up, we'll be late. I know. You're eating another one? Wow, you're hungry. Your hair's a mess. Have you put your shoes on? Come on, let's swap shoes. You know, I talked to Nabila and your dad. We decided you should stop calling me "Mom". Why? Because it hurts your dad. But why? Because I'm not your real mom. My real mom is in a grave, so it doesn't matter. You must try, it's important. What, then? Call me what you like. You can call me... I don't know... Miss World or God, whatever you like! - You're not God! - Aren't I? No, but joking aside, you have to try. I want to call you "Mom". I'll do it in my head anyway. Please... Know what we can do? Call me "Mom" when there's just the two of us. Others mustn't hear it. No-one must hear it. It's our secret. OK? You won't tell? Go put your shoes on. Let's go. - Got your shoes on? - Yes! Get in the car. Hurry up. - Got your shoes on? - Not yet. Hurry up. Meet us in the car, OK? Mom... I'll dirty the... It doesn't matter. Keep going. - OK? - Yes. - Not too heavy? - Keep going. Thanks. I couldn't have done it alone. I was a bit optimistic. You're sure it won't make the room too small? No, it's like a hut. It's nice. OK. Kids love things like that. - It's a cell! - You asked for your own room. I wanted a room. I can't help it. There's no window! - I know. - Look! I can't push the walls. What's up? There's your dad. Tell him. What's up? What's going on, kids? Tell him! What...? It's too small! - Calm down. What? - It's like a closet. It's tiny! I'll never sleep in there! I spent all day putting up that goddam wall! He's not happy! - Look at it! - It's great. It sucks! No, it's cozy. Stop shouting. I won't sleep in there! Calm down, Adrien. - I'll do what I like! - Come here. What? - Get off! - Listen! Mom worked all day for you. We're organizing a birthday party for you. And you just complain. Come here. - We need to talk. - Get off. - Come on. - Get off me, dammit! Just calm down! It's ridiculous! I'm sick of it! - Sick of what? - She keeps getting mad at me. She yells at me. Let's see the new room. It's tiny. It's not fair. She did it to please you. OK, you take Simon's room. No, let's not change it now. It's fine. That's what we'll do. Why are you hiding under there? OK, here's what we'll do. Do you want to change rooms? You take this room and give Adrien yours? You'll be next to Jules. - OK. - OK? Great. But don't chat all night. OK. When's Adrien's birthday party? Simon can't come because it's on the weekend! I know, but it was the only way Aloïs could come. No-one is free in the week. I have no choice. It doesn't matter. He can come to the party. Please, Mom! Say yes. I know it's how it works, but there can be exceptions. Yes, but he's desperate to go to the party, so... We can't take everything off him just like that. It'll be a tragedy if you stop him going. Why can't we ask his father to leave him with us for just one afternoon? I don't understand why it's such a big problem. So, once he stops living here, we won't see him again? I can't invite him to my sons' parties? So, you see, it is possible! Sometimes it is, sometimes it isn't. That proves there's no good way. He has to want to go to his dad's. He won't want to go as he'll feel like he's making a sacrifice. Well, it's up to you. It's your decision. Today is a celebration Our dear Adrien is 11 years old We all wish him a great birthday We give you flowers and wish you well Dear little Adrien May your whole life be happy Happy birthday! Come on, let's eat the cake. Let's eat it! The cake! The cake! Simon says, hands on shoulders. Simon says, flap your wings. Simon says, hands on heads. On ears. You didn't say "Simon says"! I didn't do it. - Again! Again! - Simon says stand up. Simon says, sit. Simon says, stand. Simon says, sit. Stand. You're out. I quit. Simon says, bye Driss. Goodbye! Are we nearly there? - Mom... - It can't be far now. Aren't we going in circles? Give me the address again. 2 square Terre Neuve. Code: 37D63. I don't know where we are. Hello. Eddy, it's Anna. I think we're not far away, but we're not there yet. No, I didn't find the parking lot. We're next to a play area. I must have gone past it without seeing it. We'll wait for you here. Thanks. See you in a minute. He's coming to meet us. Can I go on the slide? No. What floor does he live on? 9th. 1, 2, 3... ...7, 8, 9. He's lucky to live so high up! Can I play with your phone? Here. You got 2 minutes. Get in. Hey, kid! I'll show you my new game. - 'Evening. - 'Evening. Sorry, it's hard to find this place. Oh, OK. - So, how did it go? - Fine. We argued a bit. What happened? - Homework is always tricky. - Yeah... Can you do them when he gets back? Not on a Sunday evening. They need to let off steam. They eat, shower, there's lots to do. Can't you do things differently? I want to do other things with him than math. We need to have fun together. I can understand that. But it's up to the parents to see to the homework. It's still your job, isn't it? I'm sorry, but it'd really be better that way. Very well. OK. And the other one. Look. - Say goodbye. - Yeah, bye. Say goodbye properly. Come on. Remember what's in your bag. I gave him a photo to put on his wall. - See you next week. - See you next week, Dad. Time goes slow without you. - Goodbye. - Bye. Let's go. - Pretty photo. - Yeah. It was a long time ago. A very long time. I wasn't a month old. - I wasn't a month old. - I think you were. Yes, you must have been... 2 months old. 2 months or so. I was little. We can't even see you. - He was tiny. - You can see my nose. - Yes, it's his nose. - It's not! - It is. - It isn't. It looks like bacon! Very crispy bacon! Let's go to bed, kids. No! - Come on. - Simon will say his prayers. - Bismillah... - Brush your teeth. Why weren't we baptized? Was it OK at your dad's? Yes? Was he nice to you? Would you tell me if it didn't go well? Do you promise? So, you're happy to go back next week? Great. OK, say your prayers. Then, go to sleep. Eddy, let me tell you that I don't agree AT ALL... Did you imagine his mom like that? Not at all. - Who are you texting? - Nobody. In the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. Amen. Hail Mary, full of Grace. The Lord is with thee. Blessed art thou amongst women, blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus. Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us sinners, now and at the hour of our death. May Jules sleep well, may Adrien sleep well, may Dad sleep well, may Driss sleep well, and may Mom sleep well. Amen. Mom! Mom! I'm here. I had a nightmare. What is it? What was your nightmare, sweetie? We were both in a parking lot. I looked around, there was a photo. I wanted to show you, but you weren't there. And then... I saw the fingers moving and I saw that the lady had come out of the photo to catch me and she put me in a car which drove by itself. Ghosts were driving it. And then... And then, they took me. And I tried to call you... But I was scared and I tried to call you, but I couldn't make a sound, so I couldn't call you. But I heard you. Look, I'm here. Even when you can't make a sound, I can hear you. Don't worry. I could hear you on the other side of the world. The people came out of this photo? Do you want me to remove it if it scares you? I didn't hear you. Mom! Come on, kid. - What're you doing? - Taking him to bed. You'll wake him. Go on, pass it! I don't believe it. You can't widen the goal mouth! Did you see me score? Great! Bye. - 15. - What? 9 + 1 equals... 10. So, 15 in all. I was right. - No, you said 14. - Then, 15. You corrected yourself. Write it down. Bang! Got him. You're on the right! What? You're lost in a hut with a grenade! Oh, I'm on the right? Well, get me out. - I know, but... - Go outside. Come on, the last one. There's Simon! Trick or treat! Wow, you're scary! You're terrifying! Oh, how about that?! No, no, no! Stay away from me! Is your dad there? He's coming. Hi, how's it going? 'Evening. Come in. - I'll put that there. - Sure. Why's he a vampire? - Good, huh? - It's Halloween. It's next Tuesday. We won't be together. I'm getting involved. We don't do it. It's too commercial. Really? If you don't have candy for him, - you'll die, anti-capitalist! - What? Bite him! Help! Out of my way! No, not me! He did his homework. Really? Very good. It's what you wanted. Yes, that's great. Thanks. I'll kill you. Careful on the stairs. Can I show Dad my room? Sure you can. - You don't mind? - No. - What? - Nothing. That's my desk where I like to draw. I did that at school. That's my jar of crayons. That's my favorite dinosaur. That toy's broken. I did this drawing when I was a lot smaller. I pray here. And that's Oscar. He was next door in a bigger room, but as my elder son... Where's the photo? We had to take it down. Why? It gave him nightmares, so we took it down, so he could look at it when he wanted to. The photo gave you nightmares? - I don't know. - What do you mean? Simon, you said the photo scared you. Did you want it down? Did you? If you don't want it up, that's OK. OK? Want it up? OK, I'll go get it. I just misunderstood. It's a misunderstanding. I love you. See you next week, OK? I'll show you out. It's tricky for everyone. Am I getting ideas? She doesn't judge you. Messages received... What's this message? See that? - When was that? - 10 days ago. You can't text that! It's insulting! We should talk to Nabila. You know I can't. She's on his side. What? If you can't talk to her... I can talk to her just fine! - What's going on? - Move! You've got a mouth! Why didn't you say you wanted the photo instead of making me look a fool? - Mom... - In front of everyone. - You happy now? - It's not their fault. Take those filthy teeth out and get in your room! - What the hell? - Leave me alone. - Calm down. - Leave me alone. You texted... - It's not your problem. - What? It's not. Telling me how to do my job? - Mom... - Yes, kitten. Sorry I didn't say I wanted the photo taken down. No, no, it's my fault. I took it down, honey. It's not you. Hey, it's over. It's all over. It's forgotten, OK? Come here. I love you, Mom. I want to stay with you all the time. I know. Where's the yellow outfit? I was looking for it. It's a bit dirty. Never mind. Can you fold it? Thank you. I had something else to do. What was it? Oh, yes. Adri, try that on. Thank you. Try that on. That's good. OK, great. Show me. Here... The other one. Oh, it's already too small. Let me see. Too small. Never mind. We'll give it to Aloïs. Simon doesn't have one. - Dad... - Are you doing it on purpose? You didn't ask his dad. Maybe he'd let him come. It's not possible. - I'll ask Mom. - Come back! Jules! Finish packing. You finish packing! Mom! Why can't Simon come to Gran's? Aloïs and Adrien will be together. I'll be all alone. It's true. You can tell his dad he's never seen the snow. - Please... - It's true. No, he already came with us. I don't remember. I can go to my dad's for the next vacation. I don't have to always be with him. You're spending Christmas with your dad. That's the way it is. Pack your bag. We're leaving in 20 minutes. Jules, finish packing. Stop making things worse. Stop talking about it, please. Is nobody home? Hello? Yes, we're outside your door. Well, we'll wait. See you soon. Thanks. Thanks for letting us know! Your dad's stuck at work. So, we'll hang around here. There's an echo here. Sing us a song. Go on, you've got a good voice. Nearer, My God, to Thee Mom, I want to come with you. I know. I know... I'm sorry. People go crazy at Christmas. It doesn't matter, we're here. Got your bag? In you go. OK? Yes. Got any plans for Christmas? Spend time together. Put your things away. Say goodbye. I was thinking... If it's complicated for you at work, we could take Simon with us. You're joking? No, we have family in the mountains. And Simon has never seen the snow. We thought he might like it. We don't mind taking him. Far from it. Yes, Dad, I want to go skiing! You're staying with me. It's not fair. I want to go skiing, too! I can't afford it. You can! I want to go! Don't hit me. Don't ever do that. - What was that? - It sucks here! I'd rather be with them than you! I'm sorry, it's not like him... And he doesn't mean it. You can't talk to Dad like that. Do you hear me? Say sorry. Go see Dad. You really want to go? Yes! I have to... tell Nabila. I'll do it. I have to call her anyway. I have a gift for you. Open it there. Should I show you? What's the gift? The dinosaur? You'll see, OK? Simon, come see. Come see. It's so pretty. See the snow on the trees? And there's a tree next to our house. Kids, don't go too far away. Adrien! Aloïs! We go on 3, OK? Hang on, they're hiding. I can't see them. 1, 2, 3! Attack! - We can see Grandma's house! - Look at that view... What a view! Beautiful. - Where's Grandma's house? - Over there. What's up, kid? Are you sure Dad isn't sad on his own? No! I'm sure he isn't. Want to take a photo and send it so he knows you're thinking of him? OK. You look so cute. 2 missed calls: Nabila Say a big hello. I want a nice smile. You're so cute. I want to eat you up! I'll eat you in a mouthful! Let me bite you! Anna, please call me back as soon as possible. I heard Simon isn't with his dad. I don't understand why. And why didn't you tell me? So, phone me back, please. I await your call. Come on, Simon. Then, there's Mary and Joseph. And Mary had... She had Jesus. We'll take them out 'cause there are 2 of them and they aren't born yet. - Can we put in something else? - Yes. Simon, Jules, come on, hurry up! Santa Claus is coming. We gotta hide! I can hear the sleigh bells! Can you hear the sleigh bells? - Hurry up! - I saw him! You know, if Santa Claus sees a child, he goes away. So, hide! Who can that be? Who can it be? Oh, what a thrill! What a thrill! Hello, Santa! What a thrill to see you! Hide! Is this the house of Adrien, Jules, Simon, and Aloïs? Yes! - They're here. - I hear sounds. It's just mice. There are four little mice upstairs. Do you want a drink? - I don't have time. - Sure you do. I have a long night ahead of me, so I don't have much time. Come on. Where's the tree? It's over there, Santa. Perfect! They didn't recognize me. They didn't recognize you? Great voice! Go on. That's for Aloïs. Got 'em all? - There's one more. - One more... The presents! Take it easy. You can't open them now. Simon and I are going to mass, just like every year. OK, well, I have a great idea. We'll all go to mass! Good idea. It'll take too long! - It'll take ages. - No, it'll be great. I'm not going to mass. - I'm not going. - Do it for him, just this once. It's a great idea for everyone to go get preached at. It's not just about soulless consumerism. Think of the real spirit of Christmas. - Right, honey? - OK, Mom. He agrees. Let's go. - You want to convert us, admit it! - Yep! Stop attacking my little brother! Maybe baby Jesus is made of ceramic. Stand up. How do you do that thing? Like that, that, that, and that. Head, stomach, left shoulder, right shoulder. Right shoulder? Left, then right. Did you see the baby Jesus? You OK? - Who was it? - I'll tell you later. You knew you were screwing up big time, didn't you? - Yes or no? - I said he agreed. He says you forced him, manipulated him. It's not true. Why didn't you call Nabila? She was about to report a kidnapping! That's ridiculous. Tomorrow he's going back. You can't go by night. We meet him halfway. Not on Christmas day! The cops could take him away! They'd never do that. Mom, please! Let us handle this. Max, come with me. No! I'll take him, not you. You stay with your family. Someone's coming. Someone's coming. We gotta hide! Quick! Are you all hidden? Guys... Come on out. Jules, come out. - Aloïs... - Are we opening presents? Not now. You stay. We need to talk. Come on, Aloïs. - Out you go. - Come on, Aloïs. Did I do something wrong? No, you didn't. Remember you asked me if your dad might be sad? Well, you were right. He really wants you to be with him. We had a great day today. Our trek was amazing, wasn't it? Wasn't it good? We made the most of it. But Nabila told me you must spend Christmas with your dad. So, we'll go back, but first, we'll open all the presents. I want to do it tomorrow! - No, now. - With my brothers! I know, but you're lucky: everyone wants to open them now. Well, I have an idea. I'll call Dad on your phone and say it's not snowing yet, and I haven't made a snowman. He'll let me stay longer. I'll drive you back. Back to your Dad. Mom! Call him. Call him... Get off me! I want Mom! He's asleep. He cried a lot. It's OK, Dad's here. Are you going back now? No, I'll get some sleep. Bye. I am the ghost winky... who comes out of his hidey-hole... Why did you let Simon go with Mrs. Moran? What happened to fighting for your son? Simon really wanted to go. I wanted to please him. Yes, but letting him have fun elsewhere won't reassure him of your ability to look after him. I was talked into it. - I see... - Mr. Carniero had a lot of work on. He wouldn't necessarily have enough energy for his son. And I think that putting Simon's well-being at the heart of all that... - It's important. - It wasn't your decision to make. You weren't there much lately. - I mean... - You can't say that. That's just how it is. It doesn't matter. So, I think I'm the better judge of what's best for him. You thought it better to take him from his dad? I didn't take him from his dad. I just took him for a few days to the mountains. All kids want to go skiing. Do you think Simon can one day go back to living with Mr. Carneiro? I don't know. It's not up to me to answer that. You just said you were the better judge of what's good for Simon. But not like that. Mrs. Moran, our common goal is for Simon to go back to his father, isn't it? If it's not your goal, we have a serious problem. Be honest, do you think that it's in Simon's best interests that you carry on looking after him? Yes. Right. Do you think you are the best person to forge strong ties between him and his father? Let me put it another way. Do you want Simon to leave your home one day, Mrs. Moran? No. Thank you for your honesty. - Hello. - It's me. Am I disturbing you? Hang on, I'll go in my office. What did they say? They made me understand that... They've put Simon with another family. A community foster home... with lots of children. I see. When? Next week. And... Can we go see him there or not? No. The judge decided we have to cut all ties with him for now. Where are you? At home? Yes. I'll come home. I'll be there soon. See you. Remember that? Yes. To me, that was a perfect day. From morning till night, everything was great. When I'm feeling a bit down, what I do is... I remember that day. Do you have a perfect day? That one, I guess. Really? We have the same perfect day? Well, if you're ever feeling down, close your eyes... try to go into your mind and remember every detail of that day. The sun... It was a very nice day, remember? And when you open your eyes again, you won't remember why you were sad. OK... Jules and Adri aren't coming. I don't think it's a good idea to take them. It's OK, guys. Are they yours, Jules? Yes. For Simon? Yes. Simon, put your jacket on. We wanted to link it all together. Our family history, my childhood here... I saw how happy we could be here. And animals are good for kids. We relive it every day here. I've known Olivia for 6 years. We both work in social care. And Nicolas wanted a fresh start, so he took over his parents' farm to set up this place. I encouraged him a lot to get it up and running. You sure helped us. Here are the bedrooms. This is the girls' room. There are 4 of them. - Is there a bathroom? - Yes. Let's see the boys' room. That's what interests us. That's where Simon will be. While he settles in, he'll have that bed. You can put his bag on it. He'll be sharing with Loïc who's really nice. He's the same age, so they'll get on fine. He'll be happy here. Interactions with the animals are at the heart of our educational project. It's all-important. We and the children live alongside the animals. It's our driving force. We take in children, but also animals. Exactly. It's our whole life. We've recreated Noah's Ark. That's why there are lots of animals. There are goats, donkeys... Turtledoves... All the children come here every day. They have various tasks, such as changing the litter boxes. By looking after the animals, in return, the animals help them to grow. So, our educational farm is about the kids' and animals' relationship to the world. Everyone's role. And it really opens up the children. They're scared at first. Look, cats! Loïc wouldn't go in at first. They're Bengal cats. They're cats crossed with leopards. Want to feed them? Let's see the llamas. There you are, kids. Alright? Having fun? Let's leave Simon alone for a minute. I'll leave you to it. Come with me. OK? You're staying here tonight. I'll pick you up on Friday evening. Bye, kid. You'll like it here. Goodbye. Aren't they cute? Very cute. I'm going now. Say goodbye. Go on, say goodbye. Simon, say goodbye, please. Goodbye. Goodbye. Bye. - OK? - Yes. Mom! Stop the car! Anna, no! Mom! I'm here. - Hey, Simon. - It'll be fine. - I want to stay... - Look at me. It'll be OK, you hear? Hey, it'll all be OK. It'll be alright. It will be alright. - Come on. - Come with us. I don't want to! Just stop for a second! Just a second! Simon, come on. Come on, Simon. It's OK. It's OK, kid. - Mom! - Take him. Come on, kid. It's OK. Mom! Mom! - You know what I saw at the pool? - What? She had... She was called Océane. - Why? - Because she had webbed feet. And she said... That's stupid. That's OK. She told me she had bronchitis and... Never mind. Stop! Enough. - Calm down. - It's true. Who's clearing up? - You! - No. I think it's Mom... - Adrien and me? - Yes. So, it's you tonight. - You two do it tomorrow. - What? - Us two tonight. - No! How about one day at a time? One team does lunch and dinner... Then, you're clear of clearing up. Whatever you prefer. Not Sunday evening. No, the kids go back to school on Monday. Friday or Saturday? Let's go buy their school bags. I've had enough. What, then? How about the movies? Good idea. We're going to the movies. In art, I want to do video games. - What? - Video games. - Good idea! - Programming. Coding. No, we said you'd do sport and music this year. Coding... - Because music... - They're going back on our deal. Music is gymnastics of the mind. There's Simon! Jules... - There! - Wait. - Jules! - Wait for me! Come on, Mom! Simon's there! Wait for me. - Simon! - Where? Over there. He was with his dad. I can't see him. - Let's find him. - No, we can't. Come on. Maybe it wasn't him. It was. Anyway, leave him be. He's with his own family now. We're his family. We're not anymore. If Simon wants to see us, his dad can call us. We can't trouble him now. If we surprise him and he's sad, that'd be a pity. He's here! Jules! Mom, he was right, I can see him! Oh, yeah! Mom, I can see him! Come on, Mom. See him? He's over there. Think they saw the same movie as us? OK, let's go. Let's go. Subtitles: J.
