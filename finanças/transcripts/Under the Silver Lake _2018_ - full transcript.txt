WHO ARE JESUS AND THE BRIDES OF DRACULA? PAY YOUR RENT WITHIN FIVE DAYS OR YOU MUST GO OUT WHO ARE JESUS AND THE BRIDES OF DRACULA? Hello, Mom. --Day, honey. How are you? Good. --Good. Beautiful. Are you working? --Yes, I'm pretty busy. I wanted to say that: 7th Heaven is at TCM tonight. I can not receive that, Mom. --What is that unfortunate. It is a great movie with Janet Gaynor from 1927. You do not like that? --On Janet Gaynor? Yes. I have always admired her, as small girl already. So talented and beautiful. I have to work again. I press you firmly against me over the phone. I love you. --I also belong to you. Nice week. Come on, doll. Time to go swimming. Can that music please be softer? He can not be softer. --And thanks. Come with me. We love this song, right? Very funny. How nice that you are there. It is for a role. Come in. I had an audition around the corner and I thought it would be fun to have lunch together. You still love sushi? Hell yes. Thanks. What do I smell? There are many skunks ... in the woods near the golf course. They are always spraying, I can not help it. Beautiful poster. You probably do not believe it, but I saw him perform. Is he signed? --Yes, recently. I know a girl who knows his daughter. It is her signature. Cool too. We are live in front of the estate from billionaire Jefferson Sevence. He is missing since he was at night late went fishing at Catalina Island. He would have come back. --Unbelievable. His Duesenberg from 1935 has not been found yet. Jeff, I love you. Your whole family loves you. We love you, Daddy. I know we'll see you again soon. I feel that you are still alive. We praise a reward of two million for the one who finds my husband. I beg you for your help. Bring dad home. What is that? The parrot of the neighbors. What is he saying? --I'm not sure. Not a friend? That could be. It is hard to say. My favorite number. --Why this number? I found him... in my dad's tool lettuce when I was a kid. Did you steal it? I deducted for the first time with that girl on the cover. She is handsome. -- As if I do not know. The first thing I do have masturbated. With a repeat of Charles in Charge, I think. That is amazing. I'm pretty cool. What are those? No do not do that. No. You should not look at that. Sorry. Come on. Good. Good dog. Rotterdam? That seems strong to me. What are you looking at? To that beast. Only I know the secrets from Silver Lake. I will tell the truth ... behind the mysterious murders and disappearances in this community. I have the answers. I will reveal everything ... under the Silver Lake. Do you know who wrote that? --A guy from the neighborhood. Weird, but nice. Does he ever come here? --Yes, sometimes I see him. If I give you five dollars, can you give him my number? I do not know. --I love his job ... and I want to get to know him. You just pass it on. All right, but that five dollars you can keep. Hey. Look at it, Coca Cola. That nice one man has something tasty for you. Say:Thank you. Is he called Coca Cola? --Yes. As reliable as the sun. Is that from a cola advertisement? --Yes. An old. My great--grandmother it often said. A smart woman. What kind of dog do you have? Mine died recently. What awful for you. Thank you. Nice to meet you. I liked it too. Can I offer you something to drink? What is it? I saw you when you stared at me. I did not. At the pool. Were you pulling off? --No. I also sometimes masturbate. --I also, but ... Everyone does that anyway? I just looked at you. I believe you. Do you feel like getting stoned? --That's okay with me. There we go. A whole world full of rich millionaires and we. Beautiful. What is that? Is something engraved in it? Yes, I have that had an ex--boyfriend. An ex--boyfriend? Do you like my tattoo? Is that a real one? --No, he was with the chewing gum. Fortunately. Do you like her? --Comme ci comme ça. That man does not represent anything. --I think he has something. Who is he? I know you think it's gross. When I was sick in elementary school ... I ate my salty crackers and not the chicken noodles ... and with orange juice it was so good. Such a not yet discovered ... unknown combination ... everyone once in his life must try. Sarah, we are home ... and we have someone with us. Shall we go for a drink in the pub? I can keep it better. Really? One drink, I do not want to go home yet. Not tonight. We can to do something tomorrow afternoon. Look. What do you think? A bit bizarre. A bit late in the summer to still fire fireworks. They certainly had something left. Bye. Do I see you tomorrow? --Good. You can do that. I write my name on this car. They never get this away again. Let's go. What are you doing? In LA everyone asks: Where is Jefferson Sevence? He was for years the face of the city ... with his charity work, his stunts, his production company ... and New Year's Eve shows, his contributions to award shows, the Rose Parade ... You name it. Silver Lake and the east from Los Angeles ... are around the studios built for silent films. The area was standing then known as Edendale. In 1978 discovered a resident of Silver Lake a movie click in the basement. A young man can be seen in the film holding up a plate. It says:You can only be happy here are, if all dogs are dead. Then he shoots himself by the head with a gun. He wanted to be an actor and he saw himself as the new Douglas Fairbanks. He would have been jealous of animals ... and especially disliked to Teddy the Wonder Dog. He begrudged him his success and blamed all dogs ... of his own failure. This author thinks the suicide of this unknown, failed actor ... the forerunner was from the contemporary dog ​​murders. Is Edendale cursed? For now, the answer remains hidden ... deep under the water surface ... in Silver Lake. In Silver Lake. And if the owner does not come? --Then they are gassed, I think. He does not have to go to the shelter, Dad? They have moved. What can we understand? Who does such a thing at night? They wanted to leave. They have forfeited their advance and the rent paid. They have moved. Absolutely not weird. --Why did she not tell me? No idea. Maybe she was not allowed to ... or she knows that you do not pay your rent and does not want to deal with a homeless person. And now that it is about the rent: You will be evicted from your home if you rent does not pay within four working days. I could not agree with her find on the internet. That's weird. --I know. What are you going to do now? --I do not know. Have you heard anything? about those dog killers? Are there several? Who will say it? It frightens me out of the body. It's bad if you're robbed, but that someone stabs your dog ... right in front of your eyes? You will never get over that again. DOG LOVES COOKIES REWARD Welcome to purgatory. I'm excited. I have to put everything together. --Early waste your time. Holy trinity of women, that bloom in the heat ... from the male gaze of the city. Three, three, three ... Jesus, we love you. Is Jesus still there, or is he gone already? --I'm not sure. He's with a bride. -- Are they a couple? I think so. --He goes one by one, it seems. One bride at a time. --So a romantic. You become only a bride if you fuck Jesus. He just gets away with it because he is so handsome. Blessed by His Holy Father, I think. Do you know this girl? Do you know where she is? I really want to know. Lazer an end. This is the powder room. Lubricating flap. Asshole. Jesus and the Brides of Frankenstein sounded good too ... because it's so often about vampires, and it should not become a cliché. I can imagine that you were afraid of that. What are you doing here? --Hello all. Nice to see you. Is that a ladies blouse? --Surely. Are you working? --Of course. And you? Me too. And I think about everything. How does the world work? Why would you swim on the roof with the sea so close? No idea. -- Nobody knows that. Do you know a red--haired girl, a blonde and a brunette ... who drive in an open Rabbit? --I want to get to know them. I'm looking for them. Good gown. -- Thank you, Allen. Look. That's Millicent Sevence right? Her father was kidnapped anyway? --Well a little weird. People sometimes do strange things if they suffer from something. I will give a solo performance tomorrow in Hollywood Forever. I would like to see it. This is your ticket. Do not eat or break. If only a crumb is missing, you do not get in. My God. They found Millicent's father. --Really? His body is apparently burned. Is he dead? Does she know that? I have your number from a seller in the bookstore. You wanted to talk to me. Yes that's true. I read your magazine and I wanted it ask a few questions about it. Can we agree on something? --Of course. I am with the new number tomorrow busy, but you can come by. Can you text me the address? --Which can. Awesome. Then I will see you tomorrow. We are talking about images of the crime scene. A neighbor saw the burning Duesenberg from 1935. He immediately called the police. The chief has confirmed ... that it's Jefferson Sevence. Sevence was found dead in his car ... with the bodies of three women, prostitutes. Unknown sources have reported something bizarre. There is apparently a dead dog, a bichon frisé ... found in a victim's bag. Those are the nasty and mysterious details of this murder case. Who is the Owl's Kiss? The Owl's Kiss is an old legend. She is just as frightening as the Wolfman or Frankenstein. It is a woman at night through windows or doors. She is naked and carries alone a mask of stuffed owls. She seduces both men and women and kills them in their sleep. This beautiful appearance has dozens of deaths on her conscience ... but mainstream media keep silent her death. Her motives are not known. This author thinks she is a member a cult from the financial world. The unfortunate ones are rejoiced with an Owl's Kiss. What a ball. That Jefferson Sevence is really dead. More stars die every year. People with whom I grew up. Dick Clark, Elizabeth Taylor ... Johnny Carson. --Everybody dies. Even people you thought about that they had eternal life. What were they for leaves full of scribbles next to your bed? Say it, I want to know. Have you ever heard that on old LPs ... satanic messages if you turn them backwards? Yes. --I looked at Wheel of Fortune ... and then I noticed that Vanna White ... intermittently does something strange with her eyes. She looks straight ahead, to the right and left and forth again. I wondered:does she just do that, or does it follow certain rules? Is it a pattern with a meaning? I started writing down when she did it. I've been tracking it for seven months. I was thinking: Why do we take it indiscriminately? that they are about this infrastructure ... all that entertainment and all that information ... that continuously all sides being sent on ... to every house in the whole world ... that they're about that tell the truth to us? Perhaps there are more important ones, mighty and richer people ... to pass on and pick up things that are only intended for them. It is still idiotic to assume that there is only one function for the media? You think it's weird. A little. Do not you think the rich know something what we do not know about? Maybe where you can eat well. I do not mean annoying, but you stink terribly. I can only go better. Thanks for the juice. I'll come back when the smell is gone. Here is Vanna White. She is from Atlanta. She is ... photo model of profession. Join. The water cools you off nicely. MOVIE AUDITIONS BEWARE FOR THE DOGS COURSE Doodeng, right? I will not let my dog ​​out anymore. We use a litter box. What do I smell? I do not know. --I smell it too. That's my car. Do not drag him away. This is my job. I'll pick him up if you do not have the money. I SEE EVERYTHING BETTER NOW Come in. Beer? --Gladly. Cold beer on a hot day. What are those masks? They are life masks. What is a life mask? Then they make a model in resin of faces of famous people. They are all lifelike views of those great people. Some are used in the film, others are from sculptors. Lincoln's. -- Is that his real face? Johnny Depp hangs there ... next to Grace Kelly. I have to start a family once. Then someone can inherit them from me. Those people can not be forgotten. Silence. That means it:Silence. That is how tramps communicate with each other. Are you serious? --Also trainers used it around 1930. Look. Watch. So they let each other know who was good and who was not. Where you got food, or if there was a doctor that could help you. Those kind of things. But what did Sarah do with it ... and who was supposed to be silent? I do not know. You might. There is suddenly an abundance of posters of dogs that are missing ... people and musical instruments, the past five years. There is something important to come. I feel that. Do you think Sarah is involved? --Of course. It has sex or drug trafficking to make, or with whale rituals ... or with the dog killer ... I am becoming increasingly convinced ... that the Owl's Kiss everywhere has something to do with it. I do not know that yet. Do you have a dollar bill? Perhaps. Please. Look. The sign of the Owl's Kiss. It's on all our dollar bills. With every transaction we follow her laws. Every household that eats or buys something, falls under its jurisdiction. Our world is filled with codes, treaties, hidden messages. Look here. Here and here. Words and symbols in advertisements. Sexual allusions related to companies. You take those ideologies not voluntarily. Those messages force you. Are there any messages? that are not hidden ... but that for an individual to be destined? You see them just as often like tits and hamburgers. Why all those cameras? --I want to protect myself. The Owl's Kiss demands many victims. --Is that right? I have secured it well. Now there is coming no one in without me knowing it. So here he was. I got him. I did this five years ago purchased from a collector. That card is the key to everything which I have always searched for. Are you serious? --Yes. Then you just have to go to the place to go where the characters are ... and then you send the solution. --No, it's about that card. It has been made to scale for Silver Lake to the Hills. He leads me to something special ... and one of these days I crack the code. Where is your car? He gets a new layer of lacquer because of the graffiti. I told you so. You get that with such a pooper. I love my car. --And from my dick ... so I do not need all that compensation. Where do you get something like that? --Where you buy everything. On Amazon. Take a look. Silver Lake in bird's eye view. This is a nice one. I'm going to all those houses. That girl has been a lingerie model. That body is crazy. You must be patient. Do you ever feel that you've ruined it a long time ago ... and that you lead the wrong life? A bad version ... of the life you need to have? --Nonsense. I thought I would mean something later. That people would care about me. That I would do something important. --My God. Everyone thinks that. That is normal if you think you are entitled to everything. I think someone is chasing me. That will be best. Who will not be followed? I've really noticed it lately. Even before everything got so out of hand. That is modern pursuit madness. We do not have witches and werewolves need more. We have computers. It is in any case so ... that the whole population has a mild form of paranoia. Our monkey brains do not like it that everyone is connected ... in an omniscient weird hive. It is a cesspool full of delusions, fear ... She's home. Come with me ... join... in a world full of imagination. --You are a bastard. I am leaving. See you soon. --Take care of yourself. I wanted more, but her mother came home. She realized that I a boy had a visit ... so she closed the door to give us some privacy. Did something happen after that? --I gave it up ... and then we looked at cartoons. Can I also have one? No. Bales. --You are such a stupid. Shut up, I want to watch. --I am waiting for my close--up. There he is already. Impressive. Such a big forehead I have never seen. One cigarette and then you have to leave. It looks like 20 meters high. Movie stars. On the big white canvas. Are you those girls in the movie? --Yes, that's us. Nice to meet you. Do you think it's a good movie? --I just got there, so ... It seems like a nice movie. Do you smell that too? It smells like skunk. --And weed. There are many skunks here, especially in the east. We have to leave. Come with me. --I thought it was fun. Bye. It was fun. Quiet well. I'm going to catch you, you know that. Come here. You have to take a bite before I can let you through. SECRET SUMMER SHOW Thank you for coming. I want to dedicate this first issue to the man who taught me everything. This number is for Jesus. Plates, plates. Plates? --Thanks. How are you? --I am at work. I know. Whiskey--cola. Did you find the girls you were looking for? Not yet. --I will look around. Three tasty girls in a Rabbit. Did you notice that something strange is going on with that group of friends? That is the case every day. --Good... but I'm talking about something what is even more remarkable. I went with a girl last week, totally turned around ... but she said something weird about Jesus and the Brides. What then? -- That there is a message in the music. A secret message? What kind of message? --No idea. Which girl? --One of the many. The crazier they are, the hotter the sex. I enjoyed your dance last night. Did you see me? Are you treating me? Can I have another one, please? Can I ask you something? Have you ever seen her here? That's Sarah. --Do you know what happened to her? Come with me. Where are we going? --To the basement. Come. They play old songs in the Crypt Club. I do not know her so well, but I saw her at parties and at performances. I do not know what happened to her, but it has nothing to do with us. We are from our world enjoying. From our bodies, our music. I have heard that there are secret codes or messages in their music. I think that is very strong. Jesus is hiding no message in a message. There is nothing to solve. It does not work so it is wasted effort. We have only a very short moment ... where we can kick fun ... can fuck, be free. Life is too short. Yes, right? I want to dance to this. Come. I do not know it. --Come on. Let's fuck. What is wrong? I feel so weird. --Jesus. How much of that cookie do you have? The whole cookie. Wait a second. Stand still. Hello, mama. -- I'm so glad you're recording. I have good news. I had it anyway about that movie with Janet Gaynor? I recorded it for you, and I will send it to you by post. I just wanted to ask whether you have a video recorder. I have such a thing, he is alone not connected... but if you send me that tape, I can watch it. Happy. It seemed fun if you looked too. She is so cute. I feel connected with her. Is that weird? No, that is not strange at all. I hang up again, I know how busy you are ... but I love you. And I belong to you. --Bye. I SEE EVERYTHING BETTER NOW Do you really think you are a hidden one find a message in a pop song? No idea. I remember that I was in my room at the age of ten ... all kinds of weird codes was inventing, and secret language. That generation of men is obsessed by video games, secret codes ... aliens. A hundred years ago ... every fool could walk into the forest ... and look under a stone or something else, and discover something new. Those times are over. Where are the puzzles that make everything worthwhile? We crave riddles, because they are no longer there. YOU, ALMOST ONLY, YOU and I, WE TWO, TURNING AS TEETH SIGHTS, OH TREASURE JEFFERSON SEVENCE DEATH. WHY IS HE AWAY? ENJOY HOLLYWOOD'S NEWEST GIRLS. TONIGHT. CALL NOW. It's you. What are you doing? Nothing. What kind of work, I meant. I always hear that:What kind of work do you do? How was work? Do you work hard? --Everyone has to work. You play in films. Why are you doing this? It was only one movie and I have hardly earned anything. Do you know how expensive life is here? --Yes I know. Do you want the nominee for the best supporting role of last year you suck? Then you have to call Shooting Star. Do you want the girlfriend of the protagonist in your favorite sitcom? Call Shooting Star. Do you want to fuck an It Girl? it is not that hard. You do something for the arts and I can pay my bills. You gave them your credit card? Can I ask you something? --Of course. I wondered something. Who was that pirate in that limousine in the cemetery yesterday? No idea. Do not you know his name? --He wants to remain anonymous. Do you know nothing about him? Do you have something to eat? I know her. Oh yeah? Where do you know her from? --From a party, a few years ago. Did you speak to her? --No, that was not possible. How's that? She was sitting in a glass cube in the middle of the living room. Performance art, but very stupid. She was just in a bathing suit of dalmatian fur. She did not move and did not make eye contact. All those old guys were sitting tap the glass ... but she did not move. Who were you there with? With an annoying producer, he had some other girls with him. What was his name? --I do not know that anymore. He makes action films that are based on cleaning products. I know what you mean. Exactly. So, we arrived there. We drove through the gate, they viewed our legitimacy ... and then we were allowed to go and stand where we wanted in that luxury neighborhood. We were allowed to enter all the houses, all rooms. There was food and music everywhere ... we saw them dancing, and we saw all sorts of crazy things. A big open party, as if Gatsby gave it himself. Who lived there? -- No one has said that. Very crazy. But there was one house between: the biggest house on the street, a huge brick villa. And we were not allowed to. The only house from the neighborhood. I heard some girls to tell in the bathroom ... that it was from a songwriter. That will have been a monster hit. --Sure. You. 1, 2, 3. All, that's three too. Only, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Five. Tree. One, two, three:R. Tree. One, two, three:U. Five. One two three four five. A B. Three, one, two, three:D. A. Seven. YOU. A N. A W. A T and a N. Rub over Dean's head and ... Rub over Dean's head ... and wait under Newton. Rub over Dean's head and wait under Newton. But what does it mean? Dean Martin, Harry Dean Stanton, Dean Koons ... Richard Dean Anderson ... the Dean of Admissions, Dean Stockwell, James Dean. Rub over Dean's head. The head of James Dean. Rub over Dean's head. Copernicus ... Galileo ... Kepler. Where are you? Newton. Good. Rub over Dean's head and wait under Newton. I saw... that you rubbed over the head of that image. Do that about your eyes. Then I will take you to the place you are looking for. Who are you? --The homeless king. Oh yeah? Where are we going? Just make sure you do not stumble. Some people are not aware of it ... but you... smells very unpleasant. Is that a dog? --A coyote. He will not bite me? --No. Coyotes are blessed creatures. If you ever come across a coyote when you're alone... then you should not run away. You have to follow and watch him where he leads you. People say that this country is ours. The streets... the gardens, the hills ... the houses and the caves. Everything is from the coyotes. They only allow that we use it. Where are we? You know I can not tell you that. Yes of course. Do I have to go that way? It is a bomb shelter. If you use cheap cleaning products looking, you can go to shelf 2. You agree. --What is going on? Are you a friend or family member? --I know him, but not so well. One of the neighbors has found him. Suicide. He did not seem suicidal to me. --I walked around for two hours. That guy did not track. TREASURE All. --How are you? Good. Quite good. How do I get in touch with Jesus? -- You should not ask me about that. That singer. --I am playing you. What are you doing now? --I'm walking home. Can you play chess? --No. Beautiful. I'm in ten minutes at the door. A B--actor who loves company and that gives chess parties ... with hot girls and chess players. That is a worthless move. I'll be right back. -- Is that so smart? What is this? I'm eating. Stay away from me. Why is that message in it? --Excuse me? What are those tunnels for? Why are you beating me? --There is a code in Turning Teeth. I want to know why and what it means. Help. I need to know. --I do not know anything about a code. How is that possible? You wrote it. --No, that's not mine. Gelul. --I was allowed to record a few songs. The rest is mine. --What have you got? Turning Teeth, Wire Mountain, Waltz or the Christian Shit Farmers. So all hits. -- You do not have to belittle me. Who wrote them? --They were worried. The label demanded that I record them. Otherwise I lost my contract. Do not you know who made your hits? --I have no idea. He said it was an important number was from the songwriter. The songwriter? --Yes, the songwriter. What is it? --You was talking about a party? You were in a neighborhood that was owned from a songwriter. Can you take me there? How do you know each other? --We are roommates. We work together. --We are all Shooting Stars. You too? I did not know you acted. I was in a soap when I intervened the five and six months old. Come on in. Did you write Turning Teeth? for Jesus and the Brides of Dracula? And the codes in music? I have the tunnels and the bomb shelter found. What does it all mean? Come sit down. Here next to me. Is that...? Is that the Fender Mustang from Kurt Cobain? I do not know. That is possible. I can not remember. I have so many things. -- Can I catch it? It does not matter to me that much what the message is. I only pass it on. I put him between the nuts. I hide it from people looking for it. Have you more often hidden codes? I wrote the music from your father's youth. Half of the numbers that you sang along, and I'm still busy. The teenagers are dancing to my music. Are there really ... messages in old pop songs? --And in movies, TV shows. In everything you know. Why? -- That's the pop culture. As perishable as a handkerchief. I muzzle my nose ... I find a used handkerchief, recycle it ... and then you have a wedding song. Listen. Are those tunnels there because it is going to be war? I do not know. I'm just trying to earn my living with a few cents. You already have everything. No. Do you know this girl? What an hotty. She was killed ... at the same time as Jefferson Sevence ... but you probably already knew that. --I did not know that... but I do not care what is in fashion, or cool. It is all nonsense and it means nothing. I made so many of the things what you care about. The numbers that give you a reason to live, and have fun. When you were 15, and you dropped off, then you did that on my music. You know that. That number is not written on a guitar with distorted sound. No, I wrote that. Here, on the piano, between a blowjob and an omelette. You have not turned against anything. It only mattered that I wanted to earn something. I do not believe you. --Beautiful. The real message was not for you intended. You have to laugh and dance. Enjoy the melody, because this old man you see here ... is the voice of your generation. From those of your grandparents, your parents and the generation after you. Look at you. Everything you've hoped for, you ever hoped to hear ... is fake. Your art ... your texts ... your culture ... They are casings of other people's ambitions. Ambitions that are bigger than you will ever understand. Do you find that funny? That's the best. Do not you think? Because I wrote this. And this. And this. Stop. --And this is also mine. Stop. Who do you pay for those numbers? Who do you pay for those numbers? Get out. You get it then not? You are in danger. They are preying on you, all of us. On our women and children. They are already there. You are next. I come to tell you that you must leave the premises immediately. It's about the rent. --You have not paid. It is... A punishable payment arrears. I know, I'm sorry. Give me a little time. --No way. Toe. I can not go anywhere and I will receive the money soon. You must hear. I do not like this either, but this also belongs to my work. I get it. You will have one more day. Not anymore. --Thank you. If you can not pay, I'm not that nice anymore. No, I want you to turn it off now. I trade this off. Not so greedy. Nice shirt. Then I travel all over the world. -- Can I come along? Then you make the photos. She is the youngest ever a sitcom has written and produced. How old is she? --12, but she has an old soul. The Zeitgeist is well--affected. There is no adult who has so much understanding has for its own material. How are you? Good. I am glad to hear that. This is my fiancée. How are you? Congratulations. --Thank you. Yes thank you. How's work going? --Good. Beautiful. I saw your billboard. How nice. Which? Are there several? Those at Los Feliz, near the Bigfoot. Nice to see it. I am always working hard. I have to keep doing my best. Me too. I liked seeing you. That also counts for me. Wonderful, do not you think? --Absolutely. Do you know who made it? --No. Gaynor. Janet Gaynor, the actress. My mother loves her. I also like her. Do you know who I am? I was friends with one of the girls who was with your father. She was very nice. I would like to find out what happened to her. Really? Did you learn anything? What do you think that it all means? I'm not sure yet. I do not really know yet, but I'm coming near the answer. We would stay here at night do not have to walk around. That's okay. We do not have a dog with us. GOD WILL ASSURE YOU DOGS OFFICER. If you can kill a dog, kill a man just as easily. I do not know if that is true. Are you a cat or a dog man? The terrier of my grandparents has bitten me when I was little. That's why I'm afraid of them. --How terrible. Do you have change? No. No, I'm sorry. --You can not miss anything? Does she know that you are so stingy? --Go to hell. Ugly piece of gear, motherfucker. Hufter. You have even less then I at home. Get the kler. Come and sit with Daddy, I'll be shitting you in your mouth. Lubricating flap. Gore cock that you are. I can not really say it, but I hate homeless people. Everyone says that we have to go for them worry, but they are bullies. Poltergeists. --Ghosts, you mean? They float around in our peripheral areas ... and they watch how others eat well, drink beer and fall in love. They can not participate, that's why they bother us. Give him the next time just a dollar. Have you been in there? In the reservoir? Come with me. I think someone is chasing me. Are you serious? I wanted to pretend we're here to fuck. Are not we then? I found this hidden in my father's office. H6 to G4. A chess move? Did your father chess? --Yes. To dive. H6 to G4. What do you mean? H6 to G4. H ... six. To G four. NPM 1:35 to 37.

My god, you were right. You were right. H6 ... to G4. That is the reservoir and that's Mount Hollywood. NO SATELLITE IMAGE What is it? IT IS NOT SAFE HERE Can I do something for you? My friend Sarah was murdered. These three girls know more about it. Why do you think? I do not just think so. I saw that she took something from Sarah's house ... there was a message in the music from their friend ... and I've been in the tunnels. Have a seat. Take some tea. I discovered a shelter there. A kind of bunker, just in case a nuclear war breaks out. It is not a bomb shelter. --What is it? A crypt. Was it ours? They are burial vaults for princes ... like me and Jefferson Sevence. Why does Sevence need something like that? Is the cemetery not good enough? It is not about funerals. It is about taking off. Not about dying, but about the journey to another, better world. Are you talking about heaven? --No. I'm talking about something what is reserved for a few. About something real. Our souls are becoming pulled out of our bodies ... and by this impenetrable fruit bag transported. Then we live outside this cosmos together as princes ... Without limitations. The pharaohs have done it too, like many greats from history. Are you going to die? -- I'm locked in a tomb ... with my beautiful brides and all my earthly possessions. Then we go delicious meals to take us ... drink wine, and we enjoy the TV and the sex. We'll keep it here for six months. And then you die. --No, then we rise up. Only the rich can to afford this. It costs quite a bit ... to dig tunnels and keep them hidden. But it costs more to commit murders ... without bothering you. Did you kill Sarah? These spaces will be a thousand years stay hidden. In the future they will understand ... that we were modern kings. Rulers without statues or other images. She has been here. Is Sarah still alive? -- Maybe she has already taken off. She's below in one of those burial chambers. With Jefferson Sevence? --Yes. They had found his body. -- Other people's bones ... a large part of Jefferson's teeth, a piece of skin ... and all organs he no longer needs. What anger was behind it. Why are you angry? I just want to see Sarah. We can try to call her. Do they have a phone? -- Not for outgoing calls. Sometimes they get scared and want to leave. Is she locked in there? --You do not want to miss eternal life ... because we have a physical dislike of a closed underground space. That is a very human reaction. How are you? Beautiful. Is it okay if I turn on the image? There is a friend here that you want to see. Alright. Can you hear me, Sarah? --Yes. I was looking for you. --Oh yeah? You hardly know me. I know that. Are you angry? Did I do something wrong? -- Will I get angry about it? I am not angry, I just wanted to know where you stayed. Do you really want to stay there? Yes. You will die there. Do you really want that? I talk further along. You hang on when I have recorded there? Their room is under a thick layer concrete buried. They can not leave. Do not make her upset. Be nice to her. I got him. Should not I have done it? Should not I have gone here? I do not know. I can not leave now, so I only make the most of it. That also counts for me. Anyway... how are you? Not too good. Have you ever thought about a new dog? No. -- Maybe it would be good for you. Some unconditional love. I will think about it. I have to hang up, I would cook tonight. I still have so much to do. Tasty food then. Take care of yourself. Day. Yesterday evening... I saw us in a vision the love companies underground. Then we went swimming together. Naked, in a dark puddle. Then it happened. Our bodies dissolved and turned into light. All the beautiful thoughts we have ever had, surrounded us ... and carried our souls through space ... to another world. We were laughing all the time, because we knew ... that there will never be anything would go wrong. I wish you would come with us. People with common sense do not want to stay in this world ... and do not worry about it. It is a fun fair ... with small rings huge soda bottles should throw ... in the hope that you win a prize. What are you going to win? A two--week holiday? A new car? A sum of money with which you can start renting? It is no longer ... then a stupid rabbit that is filled with sawdust. The things you care about, do not matter at our destination. How did you know I was here? We could smell you. What happened with that man and those girls? They are now waking up in the room from which they rise. Are you going to kill me now? Do you know what you did wrong? We found it in your pocket. Why do you have dog biscuits in your pocket? I used to have... I liked a girl who had a dog. When? Long ago. Did she not love you anymore? That's right. Why are there dog biscuits ... in your pocket? I was hoping she would want me back. I wanted to give the dog something tasty and stroking his ears. Just like I used to do. Then everything would be fine again. You can leave here. Really? So you're not going to ... So you're not going to kill me? --Maybe. I am still in doubt. You obviously understand that you can not tell anyone. Which is good. Day. HAMBURGERS ARE EQUAL TO LOVE I'M NOT USED TO IT TO BE HAPPY SO CRAZY:IT DOES PAIN. I'M AFRAID. DO NOT LET YOUR HEAD HANG LOOK UP. Is that patchouli? No. What does that bird say? No idea. I always wondered, but I have no idea. Damn. What is that?
