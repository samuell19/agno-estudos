You need that? You really don't need that. (doorbell ringing) Bloody hell. Here we go. Francesca. - Chess please, call me Chess. - Chess, hi. - You are? - My name is Kent Barber. And you must be Camilla? - I am. - Lovely to meet you. - Same. - How was your journey, good? - Yeah. - Yeah, it was fine. - You look a bit dazed. - It was a long. - It is so nice in here. - I'm a little tired. - Good to be home? - Yeah. - Is there anyone else here? - No, it's just us, and obviously, your father. - How is Hudson? - He's, moving on, shall we say, which is, I assume why you're here. Let me introduce myself, my name is Kent Barber, I am your father's palliative care assistant, I'm here to improve his quality of life and execute his final wishes, which brings me on to my next point. Could you please follow me into the study as we need to take care of some paperwork before anything else happens? - You know, Kent, we've had a long trip, I just would like to get up to our room, get unpacked, rest a little bit and then we'll talk about. - I understand, that's not possible. - Whatever you need to talk about. - That's not possible unfortunately, your father's wishes are explicit, and I'm sure you're aware of your father's temperament, so if we could just. - Trust me, I know my father's temperament, but my bedroom is just up the stairs. - It'll take five minutes, into the study. Your father's wishes are very clear. We don't want to upset him, do we? Especially towards the end of his life. - No, we don't wanna upset Hudson, do we? - No. If you can follow me. I'm sure you know. - I know the way, too. - Yes, of course, Chess. Oh, you can leave your suitcases over there. Please take a seat on the sofa.

Trust me, that's something I'm used to.

There must be some good memories here. - You don't know anything. I have a strong suspicion you don't know anything. - Mom, you're not giving me any reasons not to sign this paper. - Why don't you wanna sign it? - I mean, we're not gonna team up on her. - Because. - That's what we're not. - I'm tired, of his manipulative games. - You're doing what's right. - Play along. - Just, you know, can you stop saying that?

Can you just tell me what's going on? Why don't you want to sign? - Well done, you may now see your father. There he is. If you could place this on the side table, thank you. - What happened to him? - He presented with late stage dementia about two weeks ago, and, well, he's been comatose for about two weeks. - What am I supposed to do with this? - Present it to him and then place it on the side table as I literally just said when we came in. - When was the last time he was lucid? - Two months ago. - And is that when he planned all of this? - And why wouldn't you reach out earlier? - I'm merely his caretaker. If you have any questions, you should contact his attorneys. In the meantime, you are in the presence of your grandfather, and your father. - I know. I don't need you to tell me that. - Perhaps you should stop directing your attention to me and focus on him. I would appreciate it if you didn't scrunch up that letter. Thank you. - What's. - I think you are a little smug, little prick. I have had it with your attitude. How long have you known him? - I'm sorry. - Shh, shh. - They don't mean to upset you sir, it's fine. - Upset him? He's comatose. How long have you known him? - [Kent] He can still hear. - How long have you known him? - Answer her. - For a good number of years. - Just stop acting like you know me. I'm not entirely convinced you know him, but I am pretty damn certain you don't know me, so just knock it off. - You know, I don't appreciate your attitude here. - Can't she have a moment? This is her father. - This is exactly what I've been asking her to do, but she shouted. - Can you know, can you go away? - I also have a note to give you. If you could take this note I'd be very grateful, then I will leave you. Camilla? Could you give this to your mother, please? I would be happy to remove myself from this environment. Thank you. - You okay? - Dad? Dad, can you hear me? Dad? Do you remember the time we went to Italy? Those blue caves in the boat, and you were rowing. Dad, I thought you were the strongest man in the world, with the blue wall around. I miss that dad. (Chess sobbing) I'm okay, it's okay, let's go, let's go upstairs. - You're sure? - Yeah, I'm okay, it's okay, it's okay. I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. - I love you mom. - I know honey. I'm sorry. Sweetie, I'm sorry. - I love you. - It's gonna be okay. - I cannot not believe we're in your room. - He hasn't changed a thing, it's exactly the same. Look, my doggie. Oh my God. Look, oh, toys. - [Camilla] Wait. - [Chess] Oh, my gosh. - Did you ride horses? - Yeah, didn't I ever tell you that? - No, I would love to ride horses. - Oh yeah, it was, it was a lot of fun, I loved it. - Look at all of these awards. How could you forget that detail? - Sorry, I don't know, I just, I had to stop and, I don't know, it just seemed easier to put it behind me. - [Camilla] What made you stop? - Your grandfather. - Why would he make you stop? - I busted my arm, and I wanted get right back on, you know, whenever you fall off a horse, you get right back on, right? And I was ready to get back on but, it really bothered him, and he said, either I quit or else he'd sell everything, sell them all. - Sell what, your horses? - Yeah, my babies. - Are there horses back there. - No, but look, there, do you see that house right there? That's Alice's house, and at night we would send each other some flashlight signals. - Wait, Aunt Ally lived there? - Yeah, yeah, see that house right there? And we'd signal each other with the thing. - Wow. - It was so fun. Yeah, I mean, we could have just called, but where's the fun of that? - Wow. - Oh, look at this. - Oh, my gosh. - The same, it's all the same, like nothing ever changed. My mom helped me pick out this. We were gonna paint the room this color right here. - Was this your favorite color? - Mm-hm, but we never got around to it. - Gosh. Williams School Honor Society. - From high school. - Mom. So you always went by Spencer, even back in high school? - Well, yeah, I started going by Spencer, then when I was in college I legally changed it to Spencer. I was done with being a Graham. - That's not Ken, is it? - No. HMG. - Hudson. - It's Hudson. Perception is strong and sight is weak, in strategy it is important to see distant things as if they were close, and take a distant view of close things. Life is for the living. I don't know what that's supposed to mean. - Wait. - He called me Chess when I was little, because he said I could always see you're working on some kind of strategy in your eyes. Strategy, I know what the strategy is now. - But it's important to see distant things as if they were close, and to take a distant view of close things. You don't have any idea? (doorbell ringing) - Oh God, now what? - Daggett, welcome back. You must be Bronson. - I am. - Did you have a good journey? - I think so. - Yeah, it was a long one, just I need one second. - You think so? - So this is. Yeah. - This is the place, son. - Indeed it is. - It's been a long journey, we're gonna freshen up, I wanna show you around. - Unfortunately Daggett, I have something to, I have something to tell you. - I'm sorry, can you tell me who you are again? - Absolutely, my name is Kent Barber, I am your father's palliative care assistant, I'm here to improve his quality of life. - I will definitely have questions about that, we're just gonna freshen up first. - Before you go, I do have something to tell you that your father has explicit wishes for you to follow me into the study and sign some paperwork before you see any. - I'm sorry, sign paperwork? This is my house, I grew up in this house. - It's not your house, is it? - It certainly is, it's my childhood home, I grew up here. - You don't live here now, do you? - I don't understand what that has to do with anything. What kind of papers, why would I sign papers? - When you're in your father's house, you follow his rules and these are his rules, or you're free to leave. - I'm sorry. - Please follow me. - Let's follow him. - You can leave your bags on the side there. Please take a seat on the sofa. Thank you. Now you'll see before you the letter, that your father Daggett, had drawn up. You cannot gain access to the rest of the house until I see that letter has signed and we deliver it to your father. It's your choice. - First of all, people call me Clay. Secondly, I'm not happy with any of this. - Well, your happiness. - I know that. - Really Isn't my concern. - As heirs to the assets of Hudson Mills Graham valued at $850 million, Mister Graham has mandated the terms contained in this document for your inclusion in his last will and testament. Daggett Clayton Graham and Bronson Clayton Piazzo-Graham must complete the following. Daggett and Bronson shall remain in the residence upon signing this affidavit for a minimum of 48 hours prior to the death of Mister Graham.

Must be delivered in person to Mister Graham at his bedside immediately in order to stay and gain full access to the residence and grounds. The kitchen is stocked with enough provisions to accommodate the invited guests' stay on the premises. All arrangements for final services and intermittent of Mister Graham have been made and financially secured. Your attendance and participation is requested but not mandatory. By signing this affidavit, you agree to the terms here and understand the failure to abide by all conditions contained within shall result in forfeiture to any and all claims as inherit to any and all of Mr Graham's assets now and in the future. - [Kent] Do you understand? - Failure to abide by all conditions. - Do you understand, Clay? - This is madness. - It's simple, is what it is. - Just sign it, dad. - I'd listen to your son if were you. - I've heard enough out of you, thank you. - Have you? You'll be hearing a little bit more from me. Quite a bit. - This is for you. - I'm here for you. - Well done. - I used to play in this office, when my father worked before he was born. - Well done. Next stop, your father's bedroom. - Fine. - Follow me. So Clay, there is your father, could you please take this and present it to him? Thank you Bronson, and then. - How do I present it to him, he's not even, he's not even awake. Is he responsive? - He's aware of you, definitely. He's on 120 milligrams of haloperidol which is an antipsychotic, and 10 milligrams of dilaudid a day. - Why would you do that? - He's in a deep amount of pain, sir. - Hudson? Dad? This is your grandchild, Bronson. - How's it going, Pop? - He wanted to meet you. - Sorry dad. - I know it's been a long time but, I couldn't come home. I don't know if you wanted me to, but I have a family. Things are going well. - I really don't know what to say, never really, never really knew you, but, you know I'm a musician. - He's really good, he's really good, so proud of him. - Yeah, we just got back from a tour, that's pretty cool, and got to see a lot of Europe, which was really beautiful, I didn't ever think I'd be over there. - Maybe we'll play some of his music for you later. - I'm sure he would love that. Clay, your father wanted you to have this as well, it's a personal handwritten note. - I must open it now? - It's up to you. I can leave you two to be. - Yes, please. - Yes. - Why didn't you tell me this before? I never knew you felt this way. He always wanted me to fit in. Well, I didn't fit in, but I did just fine. Let's go. I have seen enough. - I'll take care of him. Wow. - Yeah, it's seems a lot smaller than when I was a kid. - It's not what I was expecting. - You thought it might be brighter. - Yeah, it's a little bland. - Yeah, well, that was probably my mood back then. I also tried to put the color into photographs that I took. I used to play around with that thing a lot, tried to learn how to edit. That was my dark room, that closet over there. Did some good stuff here, look at this. Aunt Lola used to buy those all the time. - And you took these? - Put a bunch of them together, yeah. - Wow. A Little artist, huh? - Yeah, I don't know if it was a gift or a refuge. - You know dad, was I kind of weird downstairs? 'Cause I really don't know grandpa that well, so I kind of felt, felt kind of weird, you know. - Yeah, says a little something about me, or what he thought was me. - Clay, the person who follows the crowd will usually get, usually go no further than the crowd. The person who walks alone is likely to find himself in places, no one has ever seen before. - He always wanted me to be part of the crowd. He always wanted everyone to be part of the crowd, that's how he thought I would fit in. - [Bronson] What do you mean? - But, he walked alone a lot. He left us for long stretches. He was always away on business doing his own thing. I don't know, it's like, what I had to discover on my own, he discovered it on his own. I just wish we could have done it together. - So like what, what happened? You guys seemed to like kinda lost connection after a while. - I wasn't the son he thought I was supposed to be, and I think he saw mom in Chess. Mom was gone and he couldn't stand it. It was like it was hard for him to look at her, because she represented everything that he had lost, his fault in many ways, and he couldn't look at me because I represented everything he abhorred. Funny thing is maybe if he could see me now, maybe he would be proud of me. I don't know. (doorbell ringing) Oh, I wonder if that's Chess or JR? (doorbell ringing) - JR. - How are you today? - I'm better now that I've seen you. - How's the old man holding up? - It's coming close. Would you like me to take your bag? - Well, who else is here? - Well, we've got a full house. - I see. Sure, you can take my bag. - Absolutely sir. Now, your father has some specific requests before we continue. If you could follow me into the study he'd like you to sign some paperwork. - No problem. - Thank you, JR. Right this way, JR. I'll put your bag down here. Please take a seat on the sofa. So, this is the letter that your father had me draw up. If you care to read it, and if you decide to sign it, fine, if you don't, that's also fine. Then we'll go into your father's room and deliver the letter. Take your time. It's straight to the point, just like your father. Good man, JR. Good man. - There you are. - Right, yeah. Excellent, let's get this underway then. - Yeah, I guess it's time to go face the music. - Very good, this way. Right this way, JR. - Hey dad. - Here you go. - Here's the letter you wanted us to sign. Everyone's here. I had a little something I wanted to give you, it kind of represents, the journey I've had in life in a way, and I know I was a terrible son at times and, anyway, there was a ministry that started in prison and these bracelets are actually made out of torn pages of magazines, to kind of represent how some of us tear our lives up, and we're ripped apart. And the guy who started this ministry, he has a very similar story to mine and yours, and it's called, "Torn Pages." And I just wanted to give you this, kind of as a symbol of my love for you. I've got one too. I knew you liked brown better, and I like my colors as you know. I love you dad. I hope you rest easy and, maybe one day I'll see you on the other side. - JR, that was beautiful. He wanted you also to have another special note, especially for you sir. I'll let you open that alone, and my condolences. - All right, thanks Kent. I have to get my eyes dad, I can't see worth a damn. JR, it is not the strongest of the species that survive, nor the most intelligent, but the one most responsive to change, Charles Darwin. Life is for the living. Thank you dad. Means a lot. - This is the kitchen, only it didn't look like this when I was here. - Good, 'cause I am hungry. - Anything, bigly healthy in here? - [Camilla] Oh, whoa. I'll take chips, I don't kinda want a healthy option today. It's been a long day. - Well, this is where the kitchen always was, but this isn't how it looked. Hey you. - Did he tell you about the European trip? - Oh, you know, I'm married to the (muffled). - Did you all meet Kent? - Yes. Yes. Well, he's not really, you know, getting along with him, but. - Look at that. - She's not either. - How's it going? - What, they don't sell razors in Oregon? - I know. - Good to see you. - Me too. - Goodness you've grown, you are more handsome. Look at that face. - I just a little hair in here would be nice, you know. - (squealing) JR. - Hey, how's it going Chess? You look wonderful. - Look at you. - Beats prison stripes, huh? - Well, you kind of stuck with the stripe theme, you are so dapper looking. - Wait, who is this? - This is your Uncle JR. This is my daughter, Camilla. - So this is the fuckin' homophobe. - Camilla. - No. - JR, she's just upset because you didn't come to her Uncle Clay's wedding. - People can change. - He's. - Hey. What's you been up to? - Good to see you, you look good. - Thanks, you too. - You look good, Bronson. Good to see you buddy. - Good to see you. - Cookies and milk, anybody? - I could go for some water. - Some water. - So how long have you been here? - We just got here a little while ago. It's been a busy hour or so. - [Chess] Okay. - Lot of surprises. - What is with this house? - What is with the gatekeeper? - Kent? I hate that guy. - Well, I guess dad thought he needed to hire a caregiver. - I assume you all got the contract. - He's not just a care- What is with the contract? Did you sign it? Yeah, we were asked to sign. - Yeah, I signed one, couldn't get in without signing it. - I told you this family is always based on transactions. - First of all, he pays me to leave, and now he's paying me to stay. - [Clay] At least he paid you. - Yeah, I guess I can't complain, I have my school. - I didn't ask, it was kinda. - My mom. - [Clay] So I assume everybody signed it without question? - Brother, look at you, you're getting gray. Yeah, we're both getting gray, huh? - [Clay] That happened a long time ago. - Giorgio didn't wanna come and join the fun family time here? - He rarely leaves the kitchen right now, we are- - [JR] Yeah, how's the restaurant going? - You know the restaurant businesses, it's always hard. - That is a rough. - Giorgio's is always doing well. Chess, gets busy at times, and then at other times it's not as busy, but it's your namesake restaurant, and it will be there for as long as I'm there, so. - Wow. - How about you, how's life outside? - Well, it's been pretty good, you know. - I might go swimming. - I started my own kind of ministry program, because, I mean, you know how long it took me to get my act together, and it really helps me a lot to help other people, and you know, I discovered once I got sober that I was really good at, you know, talking people off a ledge so to speak. So that's kind of what I put my mind to, and I started my own rehab program. - Wow. - About eight people. - So you have your own ministry program, and your own rehab program? - Yeah, I got close to God in jail, and then when I got out, and I went through AA and everything. I knew I had to change my life because, I was gonna end up dead. I already was dead inside for a lot of years. I mean, you know what it was like growing up in this house. - Everybody finds God in the foxhole, JR. - My whole life was a foxhole. - Well, it doesn't matter, as long as it's what is helping him find meaning in his life, and staying on the straight and narrow. If that's what's doing it for you, I'm all for it, dude. - Well, I appreciate it, and I really appreciate everything that you guys have done for me. I mean, you know, you should have kicked me to the curb a long time ago probably. - Yeah, probably. - I deserved that. - You know, that's what family is for, we're supposed to be, so, hopefully in this round of family, we did a little better and tried to. - Dad was no model father. And he wasn't really there for any of us. - Speaking of that, I hate to jump to this, but, I would just as soon take care of the memories in this house by selling everything in it. - Big houses like this aren't moving too well these days. I mean, most people are minimalist. It's kind of hard to sell a big place like this. - We'll do it. I think it needs to be done, everything and everything in it. - Well, I'd really rather not sell the house. - I'm sorry? - Well, this place was a nightmare growing up for me. I've got a really great family now, and we like the area. I'd like to move my family in here, you know, I don't care about the stuff. - Nightmare for you, you were hardly in the house. I grew up in this house. - This house? - I had to leave this house because all that drama. - You had to leave because of the way you spent your childhood, JR. I am sorry to bring this up, but I floated you for a long time. I want nothing in this house. Now, if you'd like to buy me out, I am happy to discuss it, including what you owe me. But I was happy to help you, I'm happy where you are, but I want to never come back to this house. I'd like to never see this house again. - Well, that's your prerogative, but I have a different perspective on it, and I think I did the things I did because of the family that I grew up in. - Then you should want to get rid of this house as well. - But I don't want to get rid of it. - Why? - Look, I don't mind buying out your interest, but I don't mind staying here. If I buy you out, what is the problem? - It's okay by me. - I'm just having trouble understanding why he would wanna stay in this house. I mean, don't you wanna go somewhere else and start a new life with Anna? - I already started a new life, and this house has nothing to do with it. I'd like to make this place a place of happy memories, forget about the past. I mean, I lost my wife Rhonda. I spent almost half of my life in prison. That's why I got this commemorative tattoo to celebrate my freedom and new life. - JR, we know you've been through a really rough time, but you have come out on the other side and no one is happier about that than me, but, I'm not sure if you really know what you're getting into when you move into this house. - Hang on, hang on, I need to take this call. - Are you still trying to make sense of that note? - Yes. My gosh, the man finally speaks something to me, and it's impossible to understand. What are those treasures? Look, what are those treasure chest things. - Oh, the yellow thing and the blue thing next to it? - Yeah. - Go, go, go, go, go look at it. - What is it? - Go, go, go, go look at it. It's fun, I promise you. (knocking on door) Hey, come on in. - [Clay] Looking for a party. - Hey, you found right place, you found the right place. - [Clay] Wow, it still looks like the party room. - I know, was your room the same? - Just like always. - Clay, was your room the same? - You know, my room was like a closet. - Wow. - The closet I didn't come out of for a long time, remember? How we used to talk about that. - Look at this. - [JR] Black sheep is back. - Hey. - [Chess] Hey. - [Camilla] Uncle JR. - Wow, I can't believe those records are still here. - [Chess] Why not? - Let me figure out. - Those things might be worth something. - I can't imagine, you two love, love, love. - They changed nothing about your room. - [Camilla] You know what? I think we have a lucky one. - [JR] Do you know how to use that thing? - [Chess] Yeah, she may need your help. - You want the homophobe to show you? - [Chess] She may need your help. - I think I may need your help, Uncle JR. - [Clay] Do you ever ride still? - [Chess] Not here, no. but I have some really big dogs. - Can't ride those. - [Clay] Just to remind you of those. - Not unless I hated them. - Oh my gosh. - [Chess] And really. - Wow, that song. - Yeah. ♪ In a crowded honky-tonk is where ♪ ♪ She finally broke the news ♪ - Play what they played at the funeral. ♪ I'm afraid to say ♪ ♪ The time has come ♪ - Dance with a homophobe? That wasn't exactly a good way to meet your uncle. - I'm sorry. - We should do it this way. - I'll be over here. - Wait, you have a tattoo? I always wanted a tattoo. Well, I'm not really into 'em. - Do what? - I love art mom. - I like your pants by the way. (doorbell ringing) - What in the world is someone doing here? Thought everyone was already here. (bell door ringing) - Hello? - Hello, please come in. Oh, let me help you with that. Lola, please do come in. You must be Gwen? - Yes, that is me. - It's a pleasure to meet you. How was your journey? - Fine. - It was good. - [Kent] Good. - How is Hudson doing? - He is coming towards the end, shall we say. Forgive me, I didn't introduce myself. My name is Kent Barber. I am Hudson's palliative care assistant. Yes, I'm here to improve his quality of life, and to help him in whatever he needs, and one of the things that we've got to do before you have access to the house is, to sign a small piece of paperwork that he's drawn up. We will need to go into the study. Do you remember where the study is? - [Lola] Yes I do, of course. So many memories. - [Kent] Oh darling. - You know who the hell they were? - I figured you guys might. - Who is that? Did you recognize her? No. Did you recognize? - How many surprises are we going to get on this little visit? - The older one looked a little familiar, - This has something to do with Kent and the whole transaction, I'm sure. - That Kent is pissing me off. What, freaking. - Hey do you, do guys wanna know. - Don't let him get to you, he's just doing his job. - Actually you know what, you guys just hang out here. - What is his job, is his job to me piss me off? 'Cause his doing his job. - Lets talk, let's talk. We have got to figure this out. - Who's that? - I don't have a clue who those women are. - Just, she's the one who's been decorating this house. She's like dad's girlfriend or something. I mean, look at this house. He didn't decorate this house, it's all. - All I care about is whether he gave someone else power of attorney, and if someone else holds the key to everything that's happening here. - He wouldn't do. - And that doesn't come from greed, I just don't want arguments, I don't want any more conflict. I just want this settled. - Why are we here? Well, I know why we are here. - Yeah. - But, there's so much else going on, so, I don't know if we are going to, you know? - It's probably not a good time. - No, I don't think so. - We're gonna have to hold it off a little bit. A lot of bit. Let's go see if we could find out who that was. - So, so I've gotta stay here for two days. - 48 hours, exactly. But unless you sign that, you won't be allowed to anywhere else in the house and you'll need to leave. But I don't want you to go. - Okay, I'll go ahead and sign it. - You can leave your luggage in the hallway. There he is. He's still aware of you, even though he looks like he's unconscious, he's still aware of you. Oh, if I could give this to you Gwen and just present it to him in however you feel is appropriate and necessary, then the contract would be completed. - So, Hudson you want me to stay here for two days, for 48 hours, and you want me to come and see you every morning and every evening, and I'll do that, I will. - [Lola] And I'll come see you every morning and every evening, and I do forgive you. - Gwen? Lola? You must be very tired from your journey. Please help yourself do anything in the kitchen. - Maybe if we find out, if we get to the bottom of this. - But the only way we're gonna find out is to go down there and find out together right now. - Do you wanna confront her? - It doesn't bother me. I've confronted. (knocking on door) - Hey, we figured it out. - Gwen and Lola. - [All] Gwen. - [Camilla] Lola. - [All] Aunt Lola. - [Camilla] Yeah. - Yeah. - Aunt Lola? Who would this person be with her? - I don't know. - I don't know but I got some things to ask her. - I haven't heard a peep from Lola since she left this house. - Nor have I. - Abandoned me as a child. I kind of blame her for some of the stuff I got into. - Okay, okay, we have to find out. Did you hear anything else? Did they say anything else? - Not really, no. - Wait, why are we sitting here? - We just heard the names. - After all these years and they're here because they were invited, so why would he invite her? With, who is she with? - And when? - How and that. - If he's in the state that he's in now, when did this all happen? - I wanna know why she left in the first place. - I mean, we all were invited. - Hated him or us or whatever enough to leave, why would she come back? Unless she's greedy and she wants. - Aunt Lola? Aunt Lola? - She does not get to leave us and then waltz back in the last minute and pick up the pieces. - Do you guys know why she left? - I have no idea why she left. - I don't either. - Well I do, but I wanna find out who this other person is. - Clay. - Let's go. - Clay, why did she leave? - Say that again. - The house hasn't changed at all. - I don't think it's changed, look. - Well, Aunt Lola, can you imagine my surprise to see you after all these years? - How are you, how are you Clay? - You think you're surprised? - But I'm a little stunned Aunt Lola. - Why are you here? - JR. - Don't touch me, you ran off and abandoned me. - Easy, easy JR, let's just find out what's going on. Excuse me, who are you? - Chess, Chess. - I am the one that brought Lola with me. - And who are you? - She's my guest. I am Hudson's daughter. - I'm sorry, I'm sorry, Chess, excuse me. - Hudson is my father. - Hudson is your father? - Yes, that means that you're my siblings. - With who? - Who's your mother? - You can ask Hudson. - No, actually we can't, because he's dying upstairs, and you come up out of nowhere. We don't know who you are. - [JR] You're just a gold digger looking for our money. - Why you're here and what you want. - If I was a gold digger, then why would Hudson invite me here? - We don't know that he invited you here, can you prove what you say? - Why are you here? - And what do you have to do with her, Aunt Lola? - She is my guest. - Yeah, we got that he first time, that explains nothing. - Clay, Aunt Lola, why are you here? Why after all these years have you come back? - I missed you, I missed you you know, I missed you. - Really? - You missed me so much that you just ran off and left me when I was just a kid. - Oh, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, but I just had to, I had to go, I had to go. (person clapping) - Ladies and gentlemen. Today, well, now at this time, Hudson is requiring you to keep the volume down. - I thought he was unresponsive right now? - He is aware of things that are going on, he may have end stage dementia, but it doesn't mean he's completely unaware and completely comatose. So, if we could keep the volume down and go up to the bedroom as per his requests. - You're pretty loud yourself. - Well, you need to be loud over certain people. - Maybe you could actually explain who this person is, how she got here. - I already told you who I am. - And what she has do with all. - I told you that Hudson is my father. I don't care if you believe me? - I said it is important to be quiet and not be banging tables please. - Children, children. - I have to agree with Kent right now, dad is very sick. - Thank you. - So let's just chill. (talking over each other) - This is a meeting that involves a will and there is someone here that doesn't belong. - All will be revealed in time. - That is not for you to say that I do belong. - If we could be grown ups about this, and not spoiled children, then that would be very beneficial. - Kent, we are having a family moment here, that as far as I can tell has nothing to do with you, so if you could please leave. I understand, we'll keep it down. - Francesca. - But I need you to, call me Francesca one more time! - Relax. - Your father is very ill. - You're getting your blood pressure up for no reason. - Chess quit. - Your father is very ill. - I am aware of my father being ill, I saw him. - It doesn't sound like it. - Can you please leave us alone? We have a family moment. - I am here to exact your father wishes. - Okay, all right, all right, enough, enough. - We will go up and we will say goodnight. - Thank you very much. - Then when we come back, since you are the holder of all the knowledge, you will tell us what the hell is going on here. - I will do my utmost to make the peace last, okay? If you could follow me up then to the bedroom, that would be excellent, I'm sure your father will be very, very happy. He only wishes for goodness and happiness to prevail. - [Clay] Let's just get up there. - I've gotta go. - [Clay] So we can get to the bottom of this. - Chess, you need to go upstairs with us. - Remember he's asleep, so please do bear that in mind. Take your place around his bed. Sure that he's aware of you, cares about you, and if we could just give a moment of silence, just the thoughts that may come into your head, just let them happen, be present with him, he's present with you at all times, so if we could just keep that in your mind, very grateful. - Oh Hudson, I can't keep it a secret any longer. Chess, JR, Clay, you deserve to know the truth. I know I left you all those long years ago and you have every right to be angry, but I had to leave, I had to. You see, your father and I had fallen in love. We even talked about getting married. That last night when I left, there was a terrible argument, I have never seen him so angry. He pushed me. He wouldn't listen to reason. He said I had two choices, I could either do what he wanted me to do, or I had to leave his home forever, so I left. It was only a few weeks after that, that I found out I was carrying his child. Gwen is our daughter. I never wanted him to find out about her, never, never. - So you're Gwendolyn Spencer? - [Gwen] Yes. - So you are a gold digger? - No. - Oh, she's our sister, all right. - Yes. - Because I've been running dad's business for the last five years, and I discovered from a paper trail that he's paid you over a million dollars, and you are not supposed to be in the will. - I am in the will though, and he's the one that invited me here. - That was quite the performance. When were you going to tell us that our mother's sister is our sister's mother? When were you gonna tell us about your involvement? When were you gonna tell us about all this? Now this is when you tell us? - Dad didn't want anyone to know. - Oh, dad didn't want anybody to know. He never wanted anybody to know anything, but we took care of you, not him, we did that. - That's right, and he helped you a lot too, whether you know it or not, when you couldn't buy that restaurant because they were prejudiced against you, because you were gay, he stepped in and did that, and they didn't wanna let you adopt because you were single, dad stepped in and did that too. - So I'm supposed to be grateful, grateful because he almighty Hudson Mills Graham interfered and used his money to manipulate all of us? What a grand puppet master. - Oh, goodness. Well, this has been quite the touching family moment, hasn't it? It's time now to retire for the evening. (birds chirping) - I can't eat anything, the smell of it makes me feel sick. - Have some apple juice, babe. Oh, you've got some, I've got some. Have some apple juice? Good morning. - Good morning. (chairs banging) (footsteps approaching) - So, this house is so big, how many bedrooms are there here? - Anybody want granola? Hmm? - I'll take some. - Of course you will. - I did bring some presents for you all. Would you please pass this to Chess? - It's a bird, is that, is that a nightingale? - Yes. Remember when you were a little child, we always used to call you Little Chess Nightingale. - Why'd they call you that? - [JR] She was always dragging home injured animals. - Yeah, and she often saved some of them too. - That's right, we were hoping Chess would become a vet. - Hmm. - This is for you Clay. - Oh. It's a pocket watch. - It belonged to your granddad, all for you, Little White Rabbit. - Oh, white rabbit, like in Alice in Wonderland, the book, remember? Oh. Whatever happened to that book? - I gave it to Bronson. - Aww. - JR, you know I would never forget you. This is for you. - He shall guide thy path, Proverbs 3:6, a compass? - A little something, so you'll never get lost again. - Thank you for the gifts Aunt Lola. It was very thoughtful of you. - Oh, hey, and thank you for the gift of our new sister. - Speaking of witch, I have a few questions about that, according to our new CEO, JR, evidently, Gwen signed some waivers before she accepted any funds from Hudson, which means she forfeits any right to an inheritance, sister or no. - My attorney disagrees. He says the will voids any prior agreement. - And what exactly do you expect to gain from being here? You think you are owed something because your mom's sister? - I have no claim to the money. Camille was like a sister to me, but we were not biological sisters. Her parents took my brother and I in after our parents died. - So Gwen here is your golden ticket? - Yeah, exactly how much will it take to pay you off this time? - I'll just take the house. - Good morning, everyone. I hope you slept well. Your father is ready and waiting for his morning visit. Now, I heard you dividing up the family property. Do let me know if you need any pens, pencils, I have 2B or 2A, had some architects drafting- - Oh, shut up! - Some paper. - You sad little wanker, just shut up! I am tired of you antagonizing my family like this, you bully. I don't know what Hudson has paid you to do this to us. Oh my God, you're a whore. (Clay laughing) - Oh, so you want the house? That means you two have something in common, so I'll just leave you to discuss it amongst yourselves. Oh. - I've gotta take this call. - Well, that was tense, wasn't it? Well, if you're looking for something fun to do, there's a whole slew of games in the family room, and with that, I bid you adieu. - Well, would you like to hear about our European tour? - Oh yeah, sure. - I can't believe we're doing this. - I love to write. - Thank you. - Give it to me. - I don't know to play this. - [JR] I can't think of anything else. - I will go first, do you know why? Because I'm good at this, and this whole damn thing is a charade. - Oh well, you (indistinct). - We're waiting. - [Lola] I can't see. (group laughing) - Me. - You? - [Chess] Eye. - Fall. - For you. - [Chess] To pieces. (screaming) (all applauding) - Why are you congratulating her? That was all me. - [Camilla] Oh, it was pretty good. - [Clay] Thank you. She guessed it because I'm good. - I fall because she literally did. - All right, who's next? - Not me, the only game I played for 20 years is a board in the cornhole game. - Whoa, whoa, whoa. - Cheater, cheater, cheater, cheater. Cheater. - She says I don't want nothing to do with that one. - Do it. - Is it affair, illegitimate daughter? - Okay. - Scam? - This is fun. - Okay, good, we're close already. Two words? Speak? Sing. Sing? Singing. Sing. - A song. - Two? - Sick words. - Two, two syllables? One? - Syllable? Second word one syllable. - Forearm. - No. - First word first syllable! (all laughing) - That's not how you play charades, Chess. (talking over each other) - Pets? - Sounds like. - Stab. - Stab. - Kill. Sounds like kill, okay. - Bill. Bill. - Okay. - Kill Bill. - [Camilla] Kill Bill? - Bill is it a word? - Second word. No, first word, second syllable. Okay, bill. - Is this a movie or song or what? - Building, billable, sounds like. - [Camilla] I Think we should do another one. - Scan. (talking over each other) See. Bill see, Bill, Bill, Bill Clinton. (all laughing) - No. - Bill C. Bill. - Time's up, time's up. (talking over each other) - [Kent] Quiet. - Yes sir, everybody listen to Kent, - [Kent] I have a box. - [Chess] Wow, very good, you've got a box. - [Man] You're very perceptive. - You are the one (muffled) 'cause I said I have a box. This box was created by Hudson with lots of different things for each one of you. I do hope you enjoy it. Take your time to have a look through, there's something in there for everybody, and if you need anything, I'm sure, you'll be willing to call me. Won't you, Daggett? Well, you have a lovely smile, Gwen. - Thank you. - Thank you very much, and as always if you need me, don't forget, you know, I'm right here, so you can call me at any time. - Or not. - Yeah. - Thanks again. - You all look so happy. - Is there a rattlesnake in there? - This guy. (indistinct) - Do you wanna finish the game? - All right, let's do this. - I think it's over. - Oh, look. - Do you remember anything? - That belonged to Lady Nightingale. - I don't remember wearing that. - You don't remember? - I do remember, these scarves were my mom's. - [JR] I remember this. - [Clay] Just because you didn't wear that, they put me in that because it was blue. - Oh, to match your eyes. - Sorry. - My eyes aren't blue Aunt Lola, but thank you. - [Lola] Oh, my goodness. A medal. - That's good question. - Was he in the army? Not in the army. - Was dad in the army or something? - No, never a soldier. - For what? - You could always do that. - For what? - Hudson's service medal. - Well, isn't anybody gonna remember, that I knit that, I knitted that, I knitted that, knitted that. (talking over each other) - I'm sorry. - I made that one too. (talking over each other) - Definitely mine. (talking over each other) Adorable. I don't think it would fit now. - You should keep that one too. - That was yours. - I'm sure you will. - Oh yes, I will. - This is really nice. - Thank you. - There a bunch of the postcards Hudson would send when he would leave and not come back for weeks and weeks and weeks. - Look at this one. Clay? - Oh. Oh, that is precious. - Oh, come on, that is cute. - That's Chess and Clay. - We were cute. - [JR] It's a cute picture. - [Chess] I loved my little brother. - [Clay] And you still do. - [Chess] And I still do. - [Lola] What about JR? - [Chess] I think you loved him enough Aunt Lola. - I loved JR too, but JR wasn't in the picture. - I wasn't born yet. - You weren't born yet. - I couldn't. - Do you remember how often. - You weren't born yet. - Do you remember how often dad wore this horrible, terrible tie. - He did and he wants to. - And that's mom. - Is it you or mom? - [Clay] This was his day of leaving business trip, tie. - [Lola] I think it's your mother, they didn't take much of me. - Oh my gosh, you do cute little. Oh my goodness, that's adorable. - [Lola] Camille. - No writing on the back naturally. They'd never put the year on the back of the pictures, what's up with that? - [Clay] Why would he do this? - I did not make that one, I did not make. - These stripes are not flattering. - That's Chess. - She's beautiful. - Why would he put all this together? It's almost like he finally feels regret? - [JR] That I don't have a clue. - I can't pretend. - [JR] Good thing I don't have my glasses on, I can't see. - [Lola] He loved you all, he did. - [Bronson] These are really beautiful pictures though. - [Lola] He was just too busy making money. - Yeah, Aunt Lola you say that a lot, but you don't really, explain how that could be. - Do you see any pictures of yourself in here? Oh, these are are yours Clay. - [JR] Christmas time. (women squealing) - Those are cute. There's gotta be a picture. - Yes, the beginning of his, belief in me as a clown. - Kind of started early. - Oh, I think you get this. You made this one. - Yeah, I used to like doing pottery and ceramics. - Ever the artist. - Yeah, when I was really little. - Wow. - [Clay] You remember this? Dad gave you that when you started smoking. - Oh, JR, here's your patrol badge. Do you remember what you did with the second patrol? - Yeah, I do. - Yeah, I remember, he stole kids lunch money. - What can I say? - We found him extorting money from the kids. - 25 cents to across the street. - To sit on a certain bus seat, they wanted to sit on a school bus seat with a cute girl. - Oh, that's JR he was always resourceful. - Yeah, that definitely. - [JR] This one was a natural born. - [Camilla] Aunt Lola, why are you waiting to tell all this information? - Not completely. - But you waited to tell all this information about him when he couldn't defend himself. - [Clay] Yep, that was him. - [JR] More problems than you know about. - I'll go take care of Chess. - Let's go Clay. You two stay here. (knocking on door) - Chess? Chess darling. Oh, what are you doing? You're not going anywhere. Chess, what happened? - It hasn't happened in a long time, and since Camilla was born. Come and sit by me sweetheart, like you used to. - I can't sit down. Now I thought I could do this. Well, I thought, I just wanted Hudson to look at me in the eye one more time. He never looked at me in the eye after that night, he never looked me in the eye ever again, because I was broken. You were my only ally, my only ally and you left me, you left me alone, and I had no one, I had no one. - I had to baby, I had to go. - I waited that night in this bed, all I wanted was Hudson to come in here and put his arms around me and tell me I was still his little girl and he never came. - I had to go, I had to go. After what happened, after what happened at the stadium. You saw the cheering picture down there, didn't you? Is that what reminded you of it? - Yes, it doesn't matter. God I was there, God I can could see his fat feet, and I could smell his breath, he'd been drinking beer, and he couldn't hold me tight. (indistinct) I just wanted him to leave Clay alone, I wanted him to leave him Clay alone. Why? (indistinct) - [Lola] Chess. - Chess? Chess. I heard you, I have to tell you something. - I'm sorry. - No, I'm sorry, you have to listen to me. I was secretly dating William, Gil's brother, and didn't want to be found out, and I asked him not to say anything, and I asked to cover this up, and Hudson wanted to cover it up, he wanted it to go away, that's why they fought, and that's why she left, because Hudson wanted to suppress the whole thing, and as soon as Gil killed himself. - [Chess] God it was you. - [Clay] Everybody stopped. No, no. - [Chess] It was you that was scaring us? Do you know what it's been like? - I didn't have anyone to help me anymore. - I had to keep it all inside, but I was here for you. - I know, but you didn't. - But what? - Everyone was against me. No one was on my side. - Everybody was against me, they all went at me. - Do you know what would've happened if they had found out then? They would've beat me up every day. They would've killed me. - So do y'all know anything about these things? - I don't know. - It's just this photo of my mom when she was cheering, that really upset her, like this had to set her off, but she looks pretty happy in this photo, right? - Sorry to interrupt. You, I just wanna tell you that Mister Graham's condition is declining rapidly. I've been in touch with his doctor, but I will find you when there's anything more to report. I'm sorry. - [Gwen] Well, while he tells your parents, do y'all wanna show me around the house maybe? - I actually, I just need a snack right now. Gosh. - [Clay] I was so frightened. - [Chess] Everybody blamed me, Hudson blamed me. - It wasn't your fault. - No, you're damn right, it wasn't my fault. - Nobody blamed you, we just wanted it to go away. - I was blamed because Gil raped me. I was raped because he was a rapist, and no other reason, and just once it would've been nice if someone could have told me that. - Well, I took care of it the best that I could. I took care of the son of a bitch. - You killed Gil? - I spiked his cocaine with a little something. - Why? - Because nobody else was gonna do anything about it. - Do you know what you took away from me? - Well, those two football players, they were going to say that it was consensual. He would've gotten away with it scot free in court. I wasn't gonna stand for that. Nobody else was doing a damn thing about it. - I wanted to face him in court. I wanted to point to him and say he raped me. You took that away from me. - Wasn't it better just to let it go away? - I just was pissed off too, and I wanted him dead. I mean, you were the only friend I had back then. I'm sorry. - Chess you were always so strong, we just thought if he just died and went away, it would die. - No, no, no children, remember when we said our prayers, we had to get justice for Chess. - Lola be quiet. God has nothing to do with this. What kind of God would let me be raped? I'm sorry, but no. - He cried, he cried with you. - I don't, he does know I cried. - Yes, he does, he does. - How could you just let me carry this burden? - I carried burdens my whole life, I suppressed things my whole life. That was my way of coping, that was my defense mechanism, and when Gil died, although I had no idea you had anything to do with it, I thought it could all die, and then we could move on and we could find our way again. - You cannot forget about rape. It is inside of your body. - When we first got here I asked my mom, why did you wanna leave this place? But, the longer I'm here, the more draining it is and nothing good has happened since we've been here. - I know, I know. Every day it's like I came here to support my dad, I came here to be, you know, be with you, and you know, hopefully to like tell them, that we're gonna get married. - Yeah, same. I mean, when I first got here, the first question I asked was, who all's here? But it's like, isn't this the best time when everyone is just breaking news and fighting. - Wait a minute. - What? - You need to tell your parents. - What? - If you're not gonna tell your parents that you're gonna get married. - Hold on, hold on. - I'm gonna tell your parents. - You just, were you listening? - Yes, I heard it. I heard everything you two just said. - We wanna tell them that, that is not your place or your business to tell them that, we want to tell them that, so please stay out this. - You need to tell them, You need to tell them. - Act like you know nothing. - There's too many secrets going on around here. - This is not your business. - All right, all right, okay guys, ladies, ladies, we're not doing this, okay? We are going to tell our parents. - No, that's not right. - We are going to tell our parents. - That's not right. - What are you doing? - That's not right. This is not. - No no no, you're not doing this. Stop. Stop. Stop. - Francesca. - Who has called me Francesca? - Hold on, stop. Let me just talk for a damn minute please, come on. - Did you call me Francesca? - Give me, give me, dad, Camilla and I. - Wait. - Stop. - Excuse me. - Stop. Let me just talk for a damn minute, please. - This is all your fault. - Go ahead son, go ahead. - What is it? - We're getting married. - Camilla and I are getting married. - I'm sorry, what? - We're getting married. - I think that's great. - Haven't you seen this? - I think that's great. - And I'm also expecting. - [JR] I didn't expect that. - Wow, okay. Come here. - I didn't expect that at all. - All right. - It's not like not weird. (talking over each other) - Excuse me, everyone, everyone? Excuse me. Mister Graham's time has come. His last wish was that everyone be at his bedside. Please follow me. Please just take your place around the bed. His pulse is very, very weak. These are his last moments. He's gone. If you'd like to say any final words, now would be the ideal time. - Daddy, we're back in the blue caves together again. Go in peace. - I'm sorry for all the pain I caused you. - Thank you for the love, my darling. - I wish I had something nostalgic to say. You were a tortured man. I hope you are at peace. - Thank you, Hudson. - You brought the family together. - Okay. When are we gonna read the will?
