Bo Sturges! Hank, you old son of a gun! How are you, buddy? Bo, this is my wife Alice. Alice, this is Bo Sturges. Bo was a pretty big man in our class Getting bigger every day. Hi, Alice. Nice to see you. You know, our class married darn well. A bunch of real pretty women. Where's your wife, Bo? How are you? This is my boy, Ferdie. Hello, Ferdie. He's a sophomore here. Chip off the old block. You do look like your father. That's supposed to be a compliment. He can't believe that I was ever an adonis. I knew your father at the senior dance. He had all the girls gaga. …what a wonderful time he's had each year. I had to come and see for myself. I came to the first three reunions, and then I told Remsen, I just hit the big ones: 10, 15, and so on. I think they're for the birds. Yeah, I think so, too. You and 50 other members of our class with new babies. Sour old bachelor, isn't he? Nobody has to look at them. Not much, they don't. Why don't you get married and get some pictures of your own? Tonight at dinner, I'm gonna bring down pictures of my new factory and make you all look at them. Say, isn't that… you know, what's his name? Yeah. Sure. I never thought I'd see him at a class reunion. I suppose he's got a right. Sure, but would you? I don't think they're in. I used to live here 10 years ago. Do you think they'd mind if I went in? No, of course not. § The joys of love § § are but a moment long § § The grief of love endures § § forevermore § Here. Let me. Thanks. I could have managed it. Well. Over there in the sun, I think. Too much sun burns seedlings. Obviously I'm a beginner. I never had a garden before I came here last fall. You've got a green thumb, then. All those bulbs you planted last October… They're all right, but I need some more blue in the garden. Forget-me-nots. I'll get you some seeds. I'll plant them. You sound like quite an authority. I used to have a garden when I was a kid. Of course, my dad wasn't so keen on the idea, but he wasn't around much, anyways. It was your mother's idea? No. She didn't live with us. I haven't seen her since I was about 5. She and my father are divorced. Oh, I'm sorry. Oh, you needn't be. They aren't. I was supposed to hold them together. That's how I happened to come into the world. I didn't work. That's a terrible thing, you know, to make a flop of the first job you get in life. -Don't you ever see her? -Not since I was 5. I was with her till 5, and then my father took me away. All I remember about my mother is she was always telling me to go outside and bounce a ball. Where do you want these? In the study, I think. My husband's down at the beach with the varsity club. Aren't you supposed to be with them? Tennis team went, didn't they? Yes. I've got some water on for some tea. That'd be great. I've been altering your costume for the play. I thought we might find a moment for a fitting. Sure. Do you want the door open or shut? It doesn't make any difference. Well, perhaps you'd better leave it ajar just in case some of the other boys come back early and want to drop in. Oh. Sure. I heard you singing. I'm sorry if it bothered you. No. It was very nice. What's the name of the song? The joys of love. "The joys of love are but a moment long" "The grief of love endures forevermore" Oh, and is that true? You sang as though you knew all about the grief of love. And you don't think I do? Well… Well, you're right. Ha! Only the joys, hmm? Neither, really. Oh, then you're a fake. Aren't you bringing someone up to the dance after the play Saturday? Yes. Well, there. You. Me? You're going to be a hostess, aren't you? Yes, of course. As a member of the committee, I'm taking you. All the committee drew lots. Oh, and you lost. I won. Oh, well, my husband could have taken me. Well, he's not gonna be in town. The mountain-climbing club has its final outing that weekend. Oh, yes, that's right. I'd forgotten that. I'm supposed to find out tactfully and without your knowing it what color dress you'll be wearing to the dance. Oh, well. Why? The committee will send you a corsage. Oh, yes. How nice. Well, don't have much to choose from. Oh, I guess my yellow. The boy who's in charge of getting the flowers thinks a corsage should be something like a funeral decoration, so I'm taking personal charge of getting yours. Well, thank you. You must have gotten lots of flowers when you were acting in the theater. Now and then. Nothing spectacular. Anyway, I was never any great shakes at it. Oh, I can't believe that. Oh, then you take my word for it. Come on, stand up. Let's see if this thing fits, shall we? I've got a couple of minutes before I have to leave. My dad's going to hit the roof when he hears I'm playing a girl. I think you're a good sport not to mind. He's always after me to join up clubs and things and the dramatic club would only take me if I'd play this part. Well, it's a good part: Lady Teazle in The School for Scandal. He's coming up here Saturday for the game and alumni day. If he comes over here and you see him, please don't tell him about this. No. I won't. Now. Yes, well… We're going to have to let this out around here. Now, what size do you want to be? Well, I don't know. Whatever you think. I should have thought you'd have asked some girl up to see you act and then taken her to the dance afterwards. There's no one I can ask. What do you mean? I don't know any girls, really. Certainly, back home… In the last 10 years, I haven't been home. I mean really home. Summers, my father packs me off to camps, and the rest of the time, I've been at boarding schools. So I mean it when I say I don't know any girls. Your roommate Al knows lots of girls. Why don't you ask him to fix you up with a blind date? I don't know. I can't even dance. I'm telling you this so you won't expect anything of me Saturday night. Well… we'll just sit out and talk, huh? Okay. Or I could teach you how to dance. It's quite simple. You? Yes. Why not? Look. I'll show you how simple it is. You put your left hand out like this and your right… Oh, now, you're kidding me. A boy your age and you don't know how to dance? I'm not kidding you. All right. Come on, then. I had to teach my husband. Come on. Put your arms around me. We'd better put it off. We look kind of silly, both of us in skirts. All right, then, you take it off. I've got to get up to the golf course, anyway. Take the skirt up to your room and see if you can move around in it, you know, get used to it. And then get yourself out into this lovely day. Thanks for the tea. Oh, you're welcome. Laura! Lilly, I'm sorry I'm late. You're not. I've got to go in the clubhouse and call the house. I'll be right with you. There's no hurry. It doesn't seem to be very crowded. We'll be through by 4 easily. Mary suggested we all go down for a swim after. All right. Fine. See you on the first tee. Oh, hello. Hello. It's a lovely day. I'm glad you kicked me out. I didn't expect you to be up here. I meant the beach or the tennis court. I like it up here. I've got a spot down the road there, near the sixth fairway. I go there sometimes. If you slice your drives real bad, that's about where it is. I'm inclined to hook. What are you reading? Candida. -Have a nice game. -Thanks. You want someone to carry your clubs? No. You go on reading your book. You know, these boys come here ignorant as all get-out about women, and they spend the next four years exchanging misinformation. Oh, Lilly. Honestly. This is the age Romeo should be played. So intense. These kids would die for love or almost anything else. My husband says all of their English themes end in death. Speaking of intense young men. -Hello. -Hello. -Hello, Mrs. Williams. -Hello, Tom. -Did you have a good game? -No. She won. You finally joined up with the varsity club picnic. No. They're over by the boathouse. I was just around the bend here. It's a real nice spot. Well, you know. You swim there all the time. It was a little bit windy. We thought it would be more sheltered here. That'd be stronger if you wound the thread around before you finish it. What? I'm sorry. I had a maid, taught me. She practically brought me up. I don't believe it. Well, will you look at that? I used to have to sew on all my buttons when I was a kid. -Can you cook? -Sure. You'll make some girl a good wife. I think Bill learned how to sew on buttons when he was in the army. First time I tried cooking, it was the maid's night out. and I was gonna cook scrambled eggs and bacon for my dad and me. I'd always seen her put a piece of butter in the frying pan, so that night we had bacon fried in butter. No. Go ahead and do another one while I finish this. Hey, come on, throw the ball! Come on, come on. Why don't we go back up and get a game together? Shut up. Hi! Come and join the sewing club. Tom, why don't you go and join them? No. Go on. Go ahead. Here we go, Dave. Let's have that ball right here. Yo! Back here. Steve, toss it here. Come on. Come on, let's go! Throw it back to me. Let's go! I didn't hurt you, did I? Just my pride. I'll give you a few pointers when you come to the lodge this summer. You want to watch that sudden shift of weight. That's what does it. Al, come here. Show him that one-two thing. Hey, Mr. Reynolds! Mr. Reynolds! Mr. Reynolds, look, without thinking, I'll say a word and then three words, and you pick the word of the three that fits the first one. What grade are you getting in English? Okay, first: "Beautiful". Then flowers, girls, music. -Well… -No thinking. -Girls. -Naturally. Next: "fun". Reading, hunting, gardening. Hunting. What is this, anyway? It's a quiz. "Are you masculine?" -How am I doing? -So far, so good. What do you mean, "are you masculine?" You answer all these questions, see. And then you add up your score, those of you who can add, and you know how much of a man you are, how you rate with women and things like that. One at a time! The witness before the special subcommittee on masculinity is Mr. Reynolds. I think that I shall decline to answer on the grounds that it may tend to degrade or incriminate. However, if anybody wants to have a more practical test of manly strength, I'm on. Where's Ralph? -Hey, Ralph! -Yes, sir. Where have you been? You're my only competition here. Well, they found Tom Lee. -Where? -Up the beach. Why isn't he down here with the rest of us like he's supposed to be? Because he's busy with his sewing. It's the truth. We found him sitting up the beach with three faculty wives. The guy was actually sewing. Sewing? Knock it off, Steve. Oh, look. Just because you're his roommate. Knock it off! I'm telling you, Al, it's the truth. He's sitting up there with Mrs. Sears, Mrs. Williams and Mrs. Reynolds. -Let's go get him! -Yeah! Yeah! Wait a minute, fellas. This school doesn't make anybody do anything he doesn't want to. But if he prefers the company of women, that's his business. Let's try him out on this test. That'd be superfluous, unnecessary, and a waste of time. He's still gonna beat you in the tennis finals on Saturday. I'm not denying the possibility of that catastrophe. But how is he gonna beat me? Chop, chop, chop? Sister Boy can put more twist on that ball. Sister Boy! That's good! Shut up. Why doesn't he hit the ball like a man? Because he can beat you better by cutting and chopping. Okay, fellows, come on. Let's break it up. What's the matter? Are women verboten? More or less. What? Oh. I'm sorry. Do I embarrass you by coming by? Well, it's just… I was down on the beach, swimming, and I thought maybe I'd drop by and see if you were ready to go home. Yeah. I didn't know you were going swimming this afternoon. Well, I wasn't. What's the matter? I hear you had quite a foursome down there. No. Just Lilly and Mary. And Tom. Yes. He joined us for a few minutes. Of quiet sewing. Yes, but then he joined the other boys. No. They came back without him. Oh. I suppose the boys made a big thing out of the sewing. -Can't say I blame them. -Oh, now, Bill. He got himself a little nickname: "Sister Boy". I hope you set them straight. What was there to set them straight about? But Bill, supposing it had been Al or any of the other down there with us? -They wouldn't have been. -Bill! I'm sorry that you were involved. What do you mean, involved? What are those? Oh, well, they're nothing, dear. I was just playing with the idea that we might go up to Canada alone… Canada? You know, get away, just the two of us. Gee, that'd be great, but I've already invited some of the boys up to the lodge with us this summer. -I can't disappoint them. -No, of course not, dear. I wish you'd said something earlier. -It's my fault. I should have said… -No, it's nobody's fault. Hey, Ralph! Don't break his arm yet! We need him on the team next year. I'll see you at home. Come on, it's time! Get the glasses! What's the matter with you? Mrs. Morrison! Get the glasses! Come on! Let's hurry it up! Hurry! Hurry! Hurry! Let's go! I keep telling you guys, I don't want a bunch of peeping toms mussing up my room all the time. Al, do we have to have these peeping toms hanging out of my window every afternoon? Ralph, come on. She's almost… Want her to hear you? Why don't you guys stick to your arts models magazines? Just because you're not interested, Sister Boy, don't spoil it for the rest of us. Whoa! What is it? What is it? Hey, get off the dress, will you? Dress? Don't tear Sister Boy's dress. You can sew that thing up, or you can make yourself another one out of all your chintz you got here. Come on, get out of here! I thought you were coming to the varsity outing, Sister Boy. What happened? All right, you guys. That's enough. Lay off. Come on. I just don't like this drip calling me a peeping tom and telling me what I can and can't look at. Hey, Sister Boy, is this your old man? Okay, okay. You all right? Yeah. Point to Tom Lee. He leads 40-15. Point to Ollie Delwyn. Score 40-30. Game, Tom Lee. He leads 4 games to 1. Herb! I thought it was you. Hello, Alex. How are you? I was on my way to the baseball game. -Come on along. -Yeah, well, no, Alex. I've caught a couple of points of this. It's no fun watching this pat-ballet play. Come on now. Yeah, well… Sure, Alex. Hey, bob! You heard what they're calling the tennis match? What? The mixed singles final. I don't get it. Sister Boy Lee! I'll bet you he doesn't show up at the pajama fight tonight. He'll be there. We're gonna make sure he gets a personal escort. Hey, Billy! Well, son. Hello there. Well, I hear you won. Yeah. You seemed to have the situation well in hand. I hope you didn't mind my leaving you like that, but I kind of sensed that I was making you nervous. Oh, no. You… How have you been? Oh, fine. Fine. The fellows trying to get your goat out there this afternoon? Yeah. I guess so. Why? They seem like the kind of fellows who would be your friends. Regular guys. I don't know. I noticed the characters who did applaud for you. Remember, I told you to be careful how you made your friends. You are known by the company you keep. Yeah, dad. I wanna be your friend, Tom. I know there's something between fathers and sons that makes it hard for them to be friends, but I'd like to try. Sure, dad. Are you ready? Yeah. I wanna congratulate the ball team. Hey, they beat Hanover, huh? Bonfire tonight. Big pajama fight. Sorry I can't stay for it. Yeah, that's too bad. You know, the year I was a new boy, the new fellows outclassed the older fellows, and not very many of us lost our pajamas… You know, you ought to get a crew cut like the other fellows, Tom. Why? You just should, that's all. Let's go out this way. The team's down here. Oh, okay We'll try and get you to a barbershop before it closes, hmm? I used to eat two of these a day. We all ate them. "Hickey in heaven" we called them. It looks good. Two black and whites, huh? Okay. Here we go. Ellie, don't they ever clean those uniforms of yours? Okay, what's the matter? You got a big spot right here. Do I? That's real funny. You got some chocolate up here. That's private property. Any of these guys your friends? No. This place sure is different than when I was here. I guess it is. Thanks a lot. Anytime, Ellie. Anytime. You know, you're real sweet. You're gonna go far. That's different, too. Oh, that's Ellie. I forget what her name was in my day. Ellie, baby, come on, you adorable creature. You're driving me mad. I love you! I love you! I love you! Come on! Go on. You dance with her. Oh, no, dad. Go on, Tom. Look, dad, let's go, huh? Hey! Hey, buster! It's 50 cents. Here. I've got it. Thank you. Hey, Lee! Lee! We'll see you tonight. 7 o'clock sharp. I'll tell him. That fellow spoke to you. Oh, yeah. He seemed like a regular fellow. Yeah, I guess he is. Look. He's still open. You go in there and get rid of all that hair. I'll go over and see Billy Reynolds. -Look, dad, I don't… -Now. See you back at the house. Come in. I'm in the garden. Oh, come on out. Well, excuse me, but I'm… Hello, Mr. Lee. How did you know that? Bill has many pictures of you when you were together on the teams. Oh, you mean I haven't changed? Well… I'm Laura. How are you? Yes. He is very lucky, isn't he? Thank you. I was just planting some forget-me-nots. Oh, please don't let me… No, I've finished. You're to be congratulated. Oh? On what? Tom's victory this afternoon. Oh, yes. Were you there? Yes. For a while. I left, too. Mr. Lee, this is spring. The usual time for college and school riots and general horseplay, ganging up, excessive spirit. You must remember. I just don't remember anything quite like this. Well, Mr. Lee, I'm quite sure… Laura! Herb! Bill, baby! How are you? Boy! Oh! They told me you were around. You've met Laura. And I like her very much. Everybody likes Laura. You look wonderful. I try to keep in shape. Oh! Oh! Ha ha ha! If you excuse me, I'll go and fix you a drink. I can't stay very long. I have to catch the 6:54 back. I won't be long. That's a fine girl, Bill. Herb, you saw Tom? Yes. I left him at the barbershop to get his hair cut. What's this all about, Bill? I went to the tennis match this afternoon, and I was humiliated. Come back to a 25th reunion just to be humiliated. Yes, I heard about it. And in the locker room: "sister boy" they called him. What is it, Bill? Well, Herb, he's a strange kid. He keeps to himself. He's different from the rest of them, and naturally, they just resent it. This whole thing came to a head because last Wednesday he was supposed to go swimming with the varsity club. Instead, he went down to the beach with some faculty wives. Some of the boys came upon him, and there he was, sitting with them, sewing. Yes, well, I guess I'm not surprised, Bill. You see, when he was a kid, we had a maid. She taught him to do things like that. I fired her when I found out. Why would faculty wives you'd think they'd have better sense. Yes, Herb, you would. Why isn't he a regular fellow, Bill? He's had every chance to be since he was knee-high to a grasshopper. Boys camps, boarding schools… I've always seen to it that he was associated with regular guys. Why doesn't some of it rub off? Mr. Lee, perhaps I'm not the one to say this, but I think he is a regular fellow, whatever that is. You're being very generous to say that, Laura, but it just doesn't jive with the facts. Well, he… he is an off-horse, Herb. He's going to have to learn to run with the other horses. I want to be proud of him. That's why I had him in the first place. But he makes it so difficult for me! My associates ask me what he wants to be, and I have to tell them that he hasn't made up his mind because I just won't tell them that he wants to be a… a folk singer. He certainly isn't a chip off the old block, Herb. I guess I'll give him a real going-over at that pajama bonfire tonight. I'm very grateful I will not be there to see it. However, it may be a good lesson for him. Mightn't it be more than a lesson? Nobody ever gets hurt at these things. It's sort of a good-natured roughhouse. I'll bring you something to go with your drink. -Please, don't bother. -It's no bother. I have to go up and see Tom in a moment. You'll be there, won't you, Bill? Sure. I guess I better get up and see Tom. Okay, Herb. I hate having serious talks with him. Only other time I had a heart-to-heart talk with him, he got sick to his stomach. That's a terrible effect… Don't bother to get anything. He took his drink up to Tom's room. All right, dear. And I wish that you wouldn't try to tell him about his own son. -After all, if he doesn't know the boy, who does? -I'm sorry. I'm going to the dean's for supper. There's something I want to talk to him about. I got things in for supper here, but they'll keep. I'm sorry, but the dean couldn't make it any other time, okay? Yeah, sure. But you'll be back for the bonfire pajama fight. I wouldn't miss it. Exactly what is it, Bill? The first victory that we have over Hanover each year, all the new boys put on their pajamas and the older boys try to tear them off. Will they give Tom a going-over, as Mr. Lee said? Yes. Look, Laura, he asked for it. Oh, Bill. Maybe it will make a man of him. I've never seen you like this before about anything. This is my house. I lived here as a student, and my father before me. The name of this house means something to me. -But there is nothing… -It may mean nothing to you. You don't know how it can get blown up. You don't know what one off-horse can do to a house. Has it ever occurred to you that it might get blown up into something big for Tom, too? That it might affect him for the rest of his life and make him unsure and doubting… Tom's father put him in this house hoping I could do something for him. -So you feel you've failed. -Yes, and with your help. Oh, the beach thing. That and everything else. This boy would rather sit around here with you and listen to music and read poetry and strum his guitar than go out with the fellows. But, Bill, he's never had a home. This is the closest thing he's ever had to a home. And he sees in this house and in me… What? Oh. Look, Laura, stay out of these things. I told you when I brought you here a year ago that this was going to be an awfully tough place for a woman with a heart like yours. I told you that you'd run into boys, big and little. They'd all have problems, problems which for the moment would seem gigantic and heartbreaking. You promised me then that you wouldn't get all taken up with them. -Remember that? -Yes, I remember. It's just that this age… When I was kid here in this school, I had my problems, too. I used to sit in my room and listen to phonograph records hour after hour. I had a place where I used to go and cry my eyes out. Oh, Bill. But I got over it . I learned how to take it! When the headmaster's wife gave you that silver teapot, she told you just what she tells all of the other master's wives: that you have got to be an interested bystander. Yes, I know. Just as she says, Laura, all you are supposed to do is once in a while give the boys a little… tea and sympathy. -You remember that? -Yes, I remember. It's just that this age… 17 or 18… I know. And John was just this age. Look, Laura. I know you don't like me to talk about him, but he was just his age -18 or so- when I married him. We both were, and I know how this age can suffer. It's a heartbreaking time. They're no longer a boy and not yet a man, wondering what's going to be expected of them as men, how they'll measure up. Bill? Bill? Well, I guess I better get changed if I'm going to get to the dean's on time. You didn't get your hair cut. No. I waited, but he closed up before he could take me. Well, first thing Monday morning then, huh? Sure. This room certainly looks different from when I lived here. I had a bathing beauty or something like that right over there. Curtains? You spend your allowance on this kind of thing? Well, I try to make it look more like a… home. Yeah. My clothes used to be all over the place. I'm afraid that neatness was a virtue that I never… What's this? It's a costume Mrs. Reynolds was fixing for me. I'm in the play before the dance on Saturday night. Playing what? Lady Teazle in The School for Scandal. Tom, I want to talk to you. What's the matter? You're not going to play that part. Why not? I should think you'd have sense enough to know why not. We'll be down to get you in a taxi, sister you better be ready by a quarter to 8. Isn't it obvious why not? A boy of mine. Wait a minute, dad. You're not going to do it. I don't like my son being called "Sister Boy". You're going to have to show them. And you? No, not me. And… and Mrs. Reynolds? Yes, I guess so. Come on, now. You're going down to Bill's and phone whoever is putting on this play and tell them that you're not going to do that part. Dad, I'll do it later. Now. Dad, let me call about the play from here. Why not use Bill's phone? He won't mind. -Please, dad. -Come on. And listen: at that bonfire tonight, you put up a fight. If I hear that you didn't lick the tar out of them… well, you just fight. You understand? Come on. -Is Bill ready? -Yes. He'll be right down. I'd like Tom to use your phone, if he may, to call whoever's putting on the play. He's giving up the part. Giving up the part? Yes. I want him to. He's doing it for me. -But, Mr. Lee. -Bill will understand. Oh, Bill? Up here, Herb. What's the number of that man who's putting on the play? Tom wants to call him. Fred Mayberry. 326. You about ready? Yeah. You don't mind if Tom uses your phone, do you? Of course not. When are you going on your mountain-climbing weekend? Next weekend's the outing, Herb. Maybe Tom can go with you. He's on the dance committee, I think. Of course, he's welcome if he wants to. He always has been. Tom? Tom! 326. Tom is going to give up his part in the play. Oh? Laura, will you walk along with us to the dining hall? I don't think I feel like any supper, thanks. What? Here. I have to get along if I'm going to catch my train. Why, Laura! We'll be back right after supper. We can go to the bonfire. -You sure you won't walk along… -yes, I'm quite sure. It's busy. Keep trying, then. Now, then. Before I go, is there anything you want? Oh. Well, always remember, you want anything, just let me know. Well, I'll see you in a week or so, Laura. This will all be blown over by then. Laura, I wish that you'd… No. No. Laura. Hello, Mr. Mayberry. This is Tom Lee. Yes, I know it's time to go to supper, but I wanted you… I wanted you to know I'm not going to be able to play the part in the play. No. Well… I just can't. Here, give it to me. Hello, Fred. This is Laura. Yes, uh, yes, well… Tom's father… well, he thinks Tom is tired and should concentrate on his final exams. You had someone covering the part, didn't you? Well, yes, of course, it's a great disappointment to Tom. Look, Fred, I'll see you tomorrow, hmm? Yeah. All right. Thanks. Good-bye. Somebody's going to have to hold his sewing basket for him during the fight. Yeah. Don't want anything to happen to that. Don't forget, now. We're going to pick your roomie up at a quarter to 8. Tom? Tom? Tom? I thought I'd call little Joan Harrison and ask her over to tea tomorrow. I want you to come, too, and I want you to ask her to go to the dance with you Saturday. You… you were to go with me. Yes, I know I was. Do you think so, too? Like the others? Like my father? Tom! Is that why you're shoving me off on Joan? Tom! I'm asking her over so that we can lick this thing. Tom! Let's go, troops! Hey, Cinderella, it's time for the ball! Come on, sis! Sister's hiding! Come on! Put on your nightie, and let's go! It's locked. We'll huff, and we'll puff, and we'll blow the door in. Come on! All right, let's go. Let's go! Come on! Come on! Hup, hup, 2, 3. Hup, hup, 2, 3… hup, hup, 2, 3. Hup, hup, 2, 3… hello, al. Hello, Mrs. Reynolds. You're staying out of it? Ah, kid stuff. Hup, hup, 2, 3. Hup, hup, 2 All right, break. Let's go. Al, you're not in it? What's the use? Well, sister boy… I wouldn't want you to get a cold. Bill, I don't think I'll stay. Nobody ever gets hurt in this thing. Be a pity to spoil the record. Come on. It's all about fun. Let's form a circle! You watch out for sister boy! She's very delicate! What's going on here? You don't want Sister Boy's pajamas. You leave Sister Boy alone! We're her bodyguards! Whoever touches a hair off her head dies like a dog! Sis, you stay where the nasty, rough men won't hurt you. See, no one's going to get hurt. Hey, don't mess up sister boy's hair. What, do you want to make her cry? Aw, Al! I'm sorry you did that to Sister Boy, Al, but seeing as you did… Ralph! Okay, fellows, break it up! Let's go! Tom! I'm sorry I called out over there. I didn't think. It's all right. Do you have something to put on those cuts? Tom, I didn't have a chance to thank you for the seeds. Remember. Tea on Monday with Joan Harrison. Yes, dad. Well, I don't know, dad. It just seemed so lousy that no one was tearing Tom's pajamas off. I don't know why I did it. What do you mean, what do the guys on the team think about it? How did you find out about it, anyway? Yeah. Yeah. Sure, I know Mike. Yeah. Sure, he's a nice guy. He plays first base. Yeah. Well, look, dad. Now, that's not going to be so easy. You see, it's kind of late, and even if I did want to do it… Okay, dad, I'll think about it. I can't be more definite, dad. I said I'd think about it! I don't mean to be disrespectful, sir, only it's not easy. Yeah. Look, I got to run, dad. Yeah. Yeah, okay. Yeah, dad. Bye. -Oh. Mrs. Reynolds. -Hello, Al. Is Mr. Reynolds in? No, he isn't, but can I do something? I guess I better drop down when he's in. All right, but I don't really expect him back till suppertime. Well, in that case, you might tell him just so he'll know and can make other plans. I won't be rooming in this house next year. This is the last day for changing, and I just wanted him to know about it. Oh, I see. I know he'll be very sorry to hear that, Al. I'm going across the street to Harmon's house. Both you and Tom going over? No. Just me. Does Tom know about this? Al, won't you come in and sit down for a moment? Please. Would you like a cigarette? Oh, no. I'm in training. Oh! Oh, yes, that's right. You're not looking forward to telling Tom, are you, Al? I'm sorry to hear you're not rooming with him next year. Mrs. Reynolds, my father's called me. He wants me to room with Mike Farrell next year. He says Mike's a regular guy. He's always wanted me to room with Mike. It seems he and Mike's father roomed together, and… Al, I can't tell you how much I admired what you did at the bonfire Saturday night. It took great courage. Not physical courage, but moral courage. Al, you've lived with Tom. You know him better than anyone else knows him. If you do this, it's as good as finishing him as far as this school is concerned and maybe even farther. It's my father and the fellows and… And what? Mrs. Reynolds, he does act kind of… Well, why does he have to walk so… Oh, Al. Why doesn't he talk about the same things the other guys talk about? Long-hair music! All the time! All right, he wants to be a singer, so he talks about it. He's never had a girl up for any of the dances. Which proves what? All the time alone, wandering off up to the golf course, taking off on his bike, listening to phonograph records alone over in the choir room. Al, there are certain times in your life when you would rather be alone than with crowds of people, and one of them is when you're very deeply in love. Tom? Yes. Perhaps he's in love. Now, Mrs. Reynolds, I'm his roommate. He doesn't get any letters from girls. He never writes any. He doesn't even talk about a girl. I mean, he just can't be. Oh, l better wait and talk to Mr. Reynolds. Al, what if I were to start talking about you tomorrow? What do you mean "talk"? Oh, any kind. Perhaps the same sort of talk they're making about Tom. You mean "Sister Boy"? No one would believe it. Why not? Because you're big and brawny and an athlete and what they call a top guy and a hard hitter? Well, yeah. Mrs. Reynolds, you wouldn't do a thing like that. No, Al, I probably wouldn't. But I could, and I almost would to show you how easy it is to smear a person. And once I got them believing it, you'd be surprised how quickly your manly virtues would be changed into suspicious characteristics. Mrs. Reynolds, I got a chance to be captain of the ball team next year. Yes, I know, and I have no right to ask you to give up that chance. Excuse me for saying so, Mrs. Reynolds, but it's easy for you to talk the way you have. You're not involved! You're just a bystander! You're not going to get hurt. Nothing's going to happen to you one way or the other. I'm sorry. No. That's a fair criticism, Al. I'm sorry I asked you. Yes. As you say, I'm not involved. I'm sorry. I think you're swell, Mrs. Reynolds. I think you're the nicest housemaster's wife I've ever run into. I mean, I… -I'm sorry. -I'm sorry, too, Al. Oh, hi. Hi. Oh, I don't wanna bother. No, that's okay. I wasn't really listening, anyway. That's a nice tie you got there. It's yours. You want it? Oh, no, no. I can only wear one tie at a time. You come up here to listen to records? No, I… It's been rough, hasn't it? Yeah. My brother says down at college they have riots in the spring. No reason at all, just riots. Up here they don't have riots. They just pick out some guy… I went to a meeting of the dance committee. I'm no longer on the dance committee. They said that since I backed out of playing the part in the play, I didn't show the proper spirit. That's what they said. Why don't you do something about it? Well, what can I do? Well, gee, you could… you… I don't know. I try to pass it off, but you can't pass it off. The terrible thing is that I find myself self-conscious about things I've been doing for years. Look, Tom, do you mind if I try to help you? Gee, no. How? I know this is going to burn your tail, and I know it sounds stupid, but it isn't stupid. It's the way people look at things. Now, you could do a lot for yourself. Just the way you look and talk. You mean get my hair cut? For one thing. Why should a guy with a crew cut look more manly than… I don't know the reasons for these things. I tried a crew cut a couple of times! I haven't got that kind of hair or that kind of head! I'm sorry, Al. I didn't mean to yell at you. Thanks for trying to help. Look, Tom, the way you walk… Oh! I'm just trying to help you! Nobody gave a damn about how I walk till last Wednesday! Okay, okay! Forget it! Al. Yeah? I'm sorry. Tell me how I walk. Well… Okay. Go ahead. Walk. Now I'm not going to be able to walk anymore! Go on, go on. Okay, I'm walking. Now, tell me. Well? Well, you walk sort of… I don't get it. Well, sort of… Well, show me. Oh, I can't do it. Well, then you walk. Let me watch you. I never noticed how you walk. Okay. Do it again. If you tell any of the guys about this… Do you think I would? That's a good walk. I'll try to copy it. Do you really think it will make any difference? I don't know. Not now, it won't. Thanks, anyway. Look, Tom, you've been in on a lot of bull sessions. You've heard the guys talking about stopping over in Boston on the way home, getting girls, you know? Sure. What about it? You're not going to the dance Saturday night. Not now. You know Ellie Martin, the gal that waits on tables over at the soda joint? Sure. What about her? You've heard the guys talking about her. Come on, come on. Why don't you drop in on Ellie Saturday night? What do you mean? You want me to draw you a picture? Gee, Ellie Martin. Okay. I know she's a dog. What good will that do? If I get caught there, I'll get thrown out of school. No one ever gets caught. Sunday morning, people hear about it. Not the dean, I mean the fellows. Ellie tells and tells and tells. Boy, you'd be made! -Are you kidding? -No! Of course, if… if that sort of thing doesn't appeal to you… Tom… you've never been with a girl alone, have you? I don't mean dances. I mean alone. Do you wanna know something? What? Neither have I. You mean all those stories you told about stopping over in Boston and getting girls… Okay! I'll be sorry I told you. Then why don't you go see Ellie Martin Saturday night? Why should I? You mean you don't have to prove anything. Forget it. Probably a foul idea, anyway. Yeah. Look, Tom, about next… Next year, yes? Mike Farrel's asked me to room with him over at Harmon's house. A lot of guys from the team are over there. Sure, sure. I understand. I'm sorry I didn't tell you until now, after we made our plans. I didn't know… I understand! I'll see you. Al? Yeah? Here. I said wear it. Keep it. It's yours. See you. Hi! -Laura? -I'm up here. -I beat young Harvey at handball. -Oh, good. At last! It took some doing, though. He was after my scalp because I gave him that "d" minus on his last exam. Oh, you… you wanted this… book of poems. Why, yes. How did you know? The notice from the bookstore. Oh, that's very sweet of you, dear. You've already got it. Well, yes. Someone gave it to me. Who? Oh, Tom knew I wanted it. Bill! What difference does it make that he gave me the book? He knew I wanted it, too. I don't know. It just seems that every time that I try to do something… Oh, Bill, don't say that. It isn't so! It is. But this thing of the book is funny. I don't think it's very funny. Bill? Bill? I'm very touched that you should have remembered, and thank you. Oh, Bill, don't turn away from me. I wanted to thank you. Is it such a chore to let yourself be thanked? Oh, Bill. We so rarely touch anymore. I keep feeling I'm losing contact with you. Don't you feel that? Look, Laura, I've got to… Yes, I know. I know you've got to go, but it's just that -I don't know- we don't touch anymore. You seem to hold yourself aloof from me, and a tension seems to grow between us and… You don't feel that? You don't feel yourself holding away from me until it becomes overpowering, and then… Oh, Bill, there's no growing together anymore, no quiet times, just holding hands and a feeling of closeness, like it was in Italy. Now it's… Oh, Bill, do you see? You do see. I don't know what you're talking about, Laura. It can't always be a honeymoon. Do you think that's what I was talking about? I don't know why you chose a time like this to talk about… Yes, I don't know why either. I just wanted to thank you for the book and I'm sorry I said anything. I… Could I get you some tea? No, thank you. Little Joan Harrison's coming over for tea. No, she isn't. I saw her father at the gym. I don't think that was a very smart thing for you to do, Laura. I thought Tom could ask her to the dance on Saturday. He's on the committee, and he has no girl to take. I understand he's no longer on the committee. You're a hostess, aren't you? Yes, I am a hostess. I have that mountain-climbing business this weekend. The weatherman predicts rain. Oh, well, that's too bad. You know we're losing Al next year because of Tom. Oh, you've heard. Yep. He'll probably be captain of the baseball team. Last time we had a major sports captain was eight years ago. Yes. I'm sorry about that. However, we'll also be losing Tom. Oh? Yeah. We have no singles in this house, and Tom will be rooming alone. I'm sorry to hear that. I knew that you would be. Bill, why should my interest in this boy make you angry? I'm not angry. You're not only angry, it's almost as though you were, well, jealous. What? Come now, Laura. How else can you explain your vindictive attitude towards him? I'll go directly from class to the dining hall, all right? Yes, dear, of course it's all right. And, Laura, seeing Tom so much, having him to tea alone all the time… Yes, dear. I think you ought to have him down only when you have the other boys. For his own good. I mean that. Now, I'll see you in the dining hall. Try to be on time. Hello. I'd like to speak to Ellie Martin, please. Oh, hello. Ellie? This is Tom Lee. Tom Lee. Well, I'm down at the soda fountain all the time with my roommate Al Thompson. Yeah. Well, I'll tell you what I wanted, Ellie. I'm not going to the dance on Saturday night, and I wondered if you're doing anything. Well, I mean, I wondered if maybe I could drop over and pick you up after you get through work on Saturday night. I don't know what's in it for you. Yeah, something, I guess. I just thought I'd like to see you. Okay, well, what time do you get through work? 9 o'clock? All right. I'll see you then. Oh! Thanks. Oh, excuse me, Mrs. Reynolds. How are you, Ellie? Keep your big, fat hands off me. I'm in a hurry. I'm late picking up my girl for the dance. Say, aren't we the little gentleman tonight? -Live it up, buster. -All right. I'd like a package of these. -Matches? -No, thanks. Thanks. Want something else? No, thanks. You're Mrs. Reynolds, aren't you? Yes. Nice flowers. Having a party? Yes. Of sorts. Real pretty. Take one. Thanks. -Well, good night. -Good night. Oh! Have a nice party. Thanks. I'll never make it. Tom? Well, I've been expecting you. Are you going to the dance after all? No. You can report me if you like, out after hours, or you can give me permission. Can I have permission to go out? I think I better get you some coffee. You can tell them that, too, that I've been drinking. There'll be lots to tell before… I didn't drink much, but I didn't eat much, either. Let me get you something to eat. No. I can't stay. Well, all right. It's a nasty night out, isn't it? I wasn't planning to come in. Then why the flowers? And the card? "For a pleasant evening" Well, that was for the dance. I forgot to cancel. Well, I'm glad you didn't. Why? For one thing, I like to get flowers, and for another thing, it's my… Let me get you some coffee. It's all made. No. I'm just about right. Look… drink this. I've only had a sip. Come on. Well, you can drink from this side. And for another thing? What do you mean? Well, for one thing, you… Oh, yes. I like to get flowers, and for another thing, it's nice to have flowers on my anniversary. Anniversary? Yes. And Mr. Reynolds on a mountaintop with 20 stulp ??? … Didn't he remember? Well, it's not that anniversary. Oh? Come along. Let me take your coat. No. I… Well, how nice you look. Put me in a blue suit and I look like a kid. How did you know I liked these flowers? You mentioned it. You're very quick to notice these things. So was he. Who? My first husband. That's the anniversary. Well, I… I didn't know. He was, I'd say, about your age. How old are you, Tom? 18… tomorrow. Tomorrow? We'll celebrate. You'd better not make any plans. He was just your age then, maybe a few months older. Such a lonely boy, away from home for the first time and going off to war. War? Yes. He was killed. I'm sorry… but I'm glad to hear about him. Glad? Yes. I don't know. He sounds like someone you should have been married to and not… I'm sorry. He was killed being conspicuously brave. He had to be conspicuously brave, you see, because, well, something had happened in training camp -I don't know what- but he was afraid the others thought him a coward. He showed them he wasn't. He had that satisfaction. What was it worth if it killed him? I don't know, but I can understand. Yes, of course you can. You're very like him. Me? Here. Before I finish it all. He was kind and gentle and lonely. We knew it wouldn't last. We sensed it. But he always said, "why must the test of everything be its durability?" I'm sorry he was killed. I'm sorry he was killed the way he was killed. In trying to prove he was a man, he died a boy. Still, he must have died happy. Why? Because he proved his courage? That and because he was married to you. I've got to go. Please, Tom. I've got to! It must be a very important engagement. It is. If you go now, I'll think I've bored you talking all about myself. No, you haven't. I probably shouldn't have gone on like that, but I just got into a reminiscent mood. Don't you ever get in reminiscing moods on nights like this? About what? Come, now. There must be something nice to remember. Or someone, isn't there? Can I have some more coffee? Yes, of course. It was my seventh grade teacher. What? That's who I remember. Oh. Miss Middleton. How sweet. It wasn't sweet. It was terrible. Tell me about her. Well, she was just out of college. Tall, blond, honey-colored hair, and she wore a polo coat and drove a convertible. Sounds very fetching. Ever since then, I've been a sucker for girls in polo coats. I think I have one. Yes, I know. Well, what happened? What could happen? As usual, I made a fool of myself. I guess everyone knew I was in love with her. People I like, I can't help showing it. But that's a good trait. Whenever she wanted someone to go downtown and help her with errands, there I was. She liked you too, then. This is a stupid thing to talk about. I can see why she liked you. I… I thought she loved me. I was 12 years old. Oh, puppy love can be heartbreaking. I'm always falling in love with the wrong people. Who isn't? You, too? Well, it wouldn't be any fun if we didn't. Of course, nothing ever comes of it, but there are bittersweet memories, and they can be pleasant. Well, now. Who else have you been desperately in love with? It's 9 o'clock. I'm late. Can't I persuade you to stay? We were getting on so well. Thanks. In another moment I'd have told you all the deep, dark secrets of my life. I'm sorry. Won't you even stay for a dance? I don't dance. I know. I was going to teach you. Some other time. Oh, please. For me? -Tell me something. -Yes? -Why are you so nice to me? -Why? You're not this way with the rest of the fellows. No. No, I know I'm not. I just wondered why. I guess, Tom, I guess it's because I like you. No one else seems to. Why do you? Well, I don't know. Is it because no one else likes me? Is it just pity? Oh, no, Tom. No, of course not. It's just that, well, you've been very nice to me, very considerate. It wasn't easy for me coming into a school my first year, and you seemed to sense that. I don't know. We just seemed to hit it off. Mr. Reynolds knows you like me. Yes, I suppose so. I haven't made a secret of it. Is that why he hates me so? Oh, I don't think he hates you. Yes, he hates me. Why lie? I think everyone here hates me, except you. But they won't. No, of course they won't. He hates me because he made a flop with me. I know all about it. My father put me in this house when I first came here, and when he left me, he said to your husband, "make a man out of him". He's failed and he's mad. And then you came along and were nice to me out of pity! No, Tom, not pity. I'm too selfish a woman to like you just out of pity. There's so much I don't understand. -Tom, don't go out tonight. -I've got to. That's one thing that's clear. I've got to. Won't you even let me teach you how to dance? Oh, Tom. Tom. No, Tom. No. Tom! Let's get inside, out of this wet! What's the matter with you? What are you doing back? The whole bunch is back. Who wants to go mountain-climbing in the rain? Hey! Come on! I don't know about that! Any of you fellows want to go across the street and get something to eat when you get changed, go ahead. Oh, hi! Hello, dear. The one weekend a year we get to go mountain-climbing and it rains. Yes, that's too bad. I think the fellows wanted me to invite them down for a feed, but I didn't want to. I thought we'd be alone. Okay? Yeah. Sure. Boy, it really rained. We didn't even make it above the timberline when it started to come down. Another hour or so, we could have made it to the hut and stayed the night, but the fellows, they wanted to turn back. What was that? Nothing, dear. Nothing at all. You know, all day long I'm up to my elbows in coffee. And what do I want when I get here? A cup of coffee. I don't want any coffee. Well, I do. You ought to take that coat off. It's damp! It's all right. You're gonna leave it on? Now, you sure you don't want some coffee? No. Thanks. Since I was entertaining, I thought I'd decorate the place. Nice, huh? -What's the matter? -Nothing. Well, I think it's pretty. Yeah, it's pretty. Yep. A cup of coffee and the radio. First thing I get here. It's crazy, isn't it? It's a lousy radio. I saw a beauty down at Meyers the other day. Well, it was 20 bucks, though. I'll get it for you. Would you? Aw, thanks. It's the green and black job. Right-hand window. Sure. Thanks. It's all right. Wanna dance? I don't dance. Well… I'm gonna teach you. It will sort of get us in the same county, huh? I think I will have a cup of coffee. You want some more? No, I don't want it. I shouldn't drink so much. I tell you, it gives me a… It's an acid condition. It's good. Say, what is it the fellows call you at the soda joint? I hear them call you something. Nothing. Well, I hear them call you something. Let's dance, huh? Boy, are you jumpy. I'm sorry. Please. Oh, look, look. Now, relax, huh? Relax. Look, just sort of walk to the music in time. And if you don't want to walk, you just stand still. Just relax, huh? Relax. Come on. Come on. You know, I'll tell you. I used to work at a dime-a-dance place in New York where… What are you laughing at? You've never been there. I don't know. Have you ever been out with a girl before? Sure. Listen, are you here on a bet or something? No. Come on. Aren't we the original hot and cold boy? I'm sorry. Now listen, quit being so sorry, or I'm gonna be sorry, too. Come on. It's a funny thing. I can't remember what they called… Well, my, my. Don't tell me I'm the first girl you ever kissed. Well… I get them all. Now, come on, puppy. Give me your paw. You see? You getting the idea, or do you wanna call mama and ask her what to do, huh? You've got soft hands, almost like a girl's. Oh, is that what they call you, Sister Boy! Well, no wonder! Sister boy! I should have known. Oh, no! What are you doing? What's the matter with you? What are you do… Just let me alone! What's the matter with you? Nothing's the matter with me! Nothing! Stop him! Stop him! He's got a knife! He's crazy! Get him! Get him! Let me alone! Stop him! Now, get that guy out of here! Let the school's cops take care of him! Will you listen to me for a second? I'm telling you, the guy went and saw Ellie. Who are you trying to bull? For crying out loud, the school police caught him coming out of her place. You're probably the last guys to hear about this thing. Well, how about that? What would he want to go and do a thing like that for? -Hello, Laura. -Hello, Mr. Lee. Bill isn't in right now. My train was 20 minutes late. I was afraid I'd missed him. We have an appointment with the dean in just a few minutes. Oh, I see. Bill's over… he's over talking to the girl. He decided someone should get the details before you go to the dean's. The details? I mean really, after all… Excuse me, Mr. Lee, but you seem rather, well, rather pleased. Well… You know Tom will be expelled for being with this girl. Now, a boy can't keep in bounds all of his life, Laura. It was just very foolish of him to be found leaving the place by the school police. I think you're proud of him. Perhaps for the first time in his life, you're proud of him because he was found out-of-bounds with a… I suppose it is hard for a woman to understand, but believe me, Laura, in years to come, it'll be just another amusing smoking-car story. -Off to the tea dance, Ted? -Yeah, Mr. Reynolds. Have a good time. Bill. Oh, hello, Herb. I was afraid I might be late for our appointment with the dean. Don't go for a minute, Laura. Is Tom sitting around telling the boys all about it? No, Herb. No, he's alone in his room. He has been ever since the school police brought him in last night. I was just telling your wife, trying to make her understand the male point of view on this matter. I mean, how being kicked out for this kind of thing, while not exactly desirable, is still not so serious. Sort of one of the calculated risks of being a man. Herb. Yes, Bill? I mean, you do agree with me on that, don't you? The situation is not exactly as it was reported to you on the telephone. What do you mean? It's true that Tom went to this girl Ellie's place. It's true that he went there for the usual reason. However, it didn't work out that way. She tried to help it along by getting him to dance. She said something about his hands being like a girl's. Anyway, the upshot of the whole thing was, he panicked. He ran to the kitchen, he got a knife, and he tried to kill himself. The story is true. Tom admits it. You still think this will make a good smoking-car story? What do you mean? Why did you want me to stay to hear all this? I thought you should know the truth. Bill, I just don't understand. I'm sure Bill will be more explicit with you if I leave the room. Laura, Herb and I are going to the dean's now. I'm playing squash with the headmaster at 5. I'll see you in the dining hall at 6:30. I wish you'd stay for a moment now. What? I'd like to talk to you. Laura, I can't. Bill, I wish you would. Herb, do you mind walking along? I'll be with you in a few moments. Well, good-bye, Laura. You're not going to see Tom? I don't think he'd want to see me just now. Do you? It's his birthday. Oh, yes. So it is. Well, I'll be going along, Bill. Now, Laura, what is it? I've got to get to the dean's to discuss this matter. Yes, of course, but first I'd like to discuss the boys who made him do this. The men and boys who made him do this. No one made him do anything. Is there to be no blame, no punishment for the men and boys who taunted him into doing this? What if he had succeeded in killing himself? What then? You're being entirely too emotional. If he had succeeded in killing himself in Ellie's rooms, wouldn't you have felt some guilt? I? Yes, you. I wish you'd look at the facts and not be so emotional. The facts? What facts? There are no facts except that this boy is different, doesn't conform to your ideas of what a man is. This whole thing is judgment by prejudice, and I resent it. He's not like me; therefore, he is capable of all possible crimes. He's not one of us, a member of the tribe, so the tribe has to find a scapegoat to reaffirm your shaky position. You keep insisting that I had everything to do with… You stood by and watched it happen. You wanted to humiliate the boy in the eyes of the school because if he was right, then you had to be wrong. If he could be manly, then you had to question your own definition of manliness. Well, Bill, he's right. Sure. Ask Ellie. Oh, because it was distasteful for him. Because for him, there has to be love. Manliness is not all swagger and swearing and mountain-climbing. Manliness is also tenderness… and gentleness… and consideration. Look, Laura, I know this has been a shock to you. I know you were fond of the boy. You did all you could for him. More than anyone would expect. But after all, your responsibility doesn't go beyond giving him… Doesn't go beyond giving him tea and sympathy on Sunday afternoons. I'm going to tell you something. It's gonna shock you, but I'm going to tell you. Laura, it's late. Last night, I knew what Tom had in mind to do. I heard him making the date with Ellie on the phone. And you didn't stop him? Then you're the one that's responsible. Yes, I am responsible, but not in the way you think. I did try to stop him, but not by locking him in his room or calling the school police. I tried to stop him by being nice to him, by being affectionate and showing him he was liked. I knew what he was going to do and why he was going to do it. He had to prove to you bullies that he was a man, and he was going to prove it with Ellie Martin. Well, last night -I know this is a terrible thing to say but- last night, I wished he had proved it with me. You don't know what you're saying. My heart cried out to this boy in his misery, a misery imposed by my husband. And I wanted to help him as one human being to another, and I failed. At the last moment, I sent him away. You mean you managed to overcome your exaggerated sense of pity? Oh, no. It was not just pity. I've been lonely here, Bill- miserably lonely. We'll discuss this later. Bill, you're always running off! We never talk things out, our differences. Can't we face them? I'm not saying it's your fault. It's probably mine, but let's look at it, examine it. Examine it, criticize it. If this thing of Tom brings it out into the open, let it come out! You've been talking about manliness. What do you know about a man? You were married first to that boy, again, a poor, pitiable boy. You want to mother a boy, not love a man. And that's why you've never really loved me. Oh, I did love you, but not just for your outward show of manliness, but because you needed me. And for one unguarded moment, you let me know you needed me. And I have tried to find that moment again, the year we've been married, to find out why you married me. This is what you want, this kind of talk? We may arrive at something honest. It may not be us, you and I, but it will be true and honest. I married you because you were kind and gentle and womanly and understanding. And toward me, you've only been critical and undermining. I have tried, Bill, in every way. I have tried, but you haven't let me. You were more interested in mothering that boy up there than becoming my wife. I only gave him the affection you didn't want. __ Oh, Bill, you do want it. Why won't you let me love you? Bill. Bill, I have tried. I have tried. Tom? Tom? Tom. I took your coat back to your room. You weren't there. Hello? Hello. I didn't think you'd ever want to see me again. Why not? After last night. I'm sorry about what happened downstairs. I'm not. You've heard everything, I suppose. Yes. Everything? Everything. I knew your husband would be anxious to give you the details. Yes, he did. So now you know, too. Tom, dear, you mustn't think… What else am I to think? But you're not in love with Ellie. That's not supposed to matter. Oh, but it does. I wish they'd let me kill myself. Tom… Iook at me. Tom? Last night, you kissed me. Why did you kiss me? It made you sick, didn't it? Didn't it? How can you think such a thing? Well, you sent me away. You… Anyway, when you heard this morning, it must have made you sick. Tom… I'm gonna tell you something. Tom? That was the nicest kiss I ever had from anyone. Tom, one day, you'll meet a girl, and it'll be right. Tom, believe me. I wish I could… but a person knows. Knows inside. Do you think that after last night, I could ever… But thanks. Thanks a lot. Years from now, when you talk about this, and you will, be kind. I'm sorry. I used to live in this room when I was here. Crummy room, isn't it? Yes, I guess it is. My name's Tom Lee. Hello. Say, did you write a book? Well, yes. I've seen it in the library. Well, I'm sorry I barged in. Oh, that's okay. Bye. Bye. Yes? Mr. Reynolds? Yes. Come in. It's Tom Lee. Oh, yes. I just wanted to say hello. Yes? Everything looks very much the same. Does it? May I… May I ask about Mrs. Reynolds? I wrote her a letter here a few years ago. Was it… I mean… I don't know where she is. A few months ago, she must have been living somewhere near Chicago. She moved from there, left a box of things which was forwarded here. This letter addressed to you was in it. Obviously, she never sent it or even stamped it. Hello. No. What's the matter? Have you got it there in front of you? All right. Oh, the week of the 9th, yeah. Yeah. Read the names alphabetically. Yeah. It's a "c" plus. That's a "b." Who? Hap Hudson? Well, that's a "b." Is that the week of the 16th? Dear Tom: I shall probably never send this letter. I probably shouldn't even write it, but I am impulsive -that you know- and my impulse is to write it. Perhaps in the cold light of morning I will tear it up. I don't know. Tom, dear, I have just read your book, your novel about your days in school, about us. It is a lovely book, tender and romantic and touching. And in it, I come out rather like a saint. But Tom, that isn't the whole picture, or even the true picture. You have romanticized the wrong we did and not looked at it clearly. At the end of the story, you say that the husband was far better off without his wife and the wife went on to her own happy life. You're quite wrong, Tom. As you'll know, I couldn't go back to Bill after that afternoon with you and pretend that nothing had happened, and my not going back ruined his life. The week of the 16th? I find that I sacrificed Bill and our marriage. He thought he knew what he wanted: to be left alone, just as you thought you knew what you wanted: to kill yourself. Both of you, in a sense, were crying out to be saved from what you thought you wanted. I answered your cry. It was the easier one to answer. These are terrible things to write to you, Tom. About guilt and right and wrong, but you are old enough now to know that when you drop a pebble in the water, there are ever-widening circles of ripples. There are always consequences. Anyway, Tom, I've often wondered if I didn't show a lack of faith in you, in your ability to meet a crisis by yourself and come through it alone. They say about dreadful experiences, if they don't kill us, they make us strong. I was just afraid that that one would kill you. Dear Tom, I was so pleased to read that you are married. Have a good life, a full life, an understanding life. Write good stories, true stories. About one thing you were correct: the wife did always keep her affection for the boy somewhere in her heart.
