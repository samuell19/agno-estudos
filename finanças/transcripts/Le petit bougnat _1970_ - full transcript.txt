THE LITTLE FUGITIVE "HOLIDAY CAMP AT SARCELLES "DEPART 1st JULY AT 8 am. ASSEMBLE AT 7:30 am." Look up there. Holy crap! Come and get me! - You'll spoil your dress! - I don't care! - Rose, get down here! - Come and get me. Sure. - Let's see. - It's Rose Bornand. Her father makes her life difficult. I always said he was a grumpy old man! Throw him a banana skin! Stay away or I'll jump! First tell me what you want! It's not hard. Swear that I won't go to holiday camp... and I'll come down. I won't swear in my life! Then come for me. Stay away! Fascism will not pass! You're not coming for me? - Come back here! - No! Guys, have a good trip and have a great time. And you, are you coming down? - I'm staying here! - Off we go! Exactly! I'll be down when you're gone! - Why? - What? - Why don't you come? - Because... barracks... aren't for girls. It's not a barracks! It's a camp I won't go. I'm too old for that. Who do you think you are? You all look ridiculous, all grouped up like that. One, two! One, two! She's mocking us! See, there come your nannies. Quiet. What? What? What? Rose Bornand doesn't want to come with us. Let her. That's her business. Come on. Gather 'round, all! Boys to one side, girls to the other. Roland, take attendance. What are you doing there? Get off. Come on up when you called, just like the rest. Go on! - Bergougnat. - Present! - Pradel. - Present! - Coquemignon. - Present! - Baladi?. - Present! Proutte... What about me, sir? - Th?odon. - Present! Alombert. Console. - Jonpierre. - Present! - Truchet. - Present! - Sir, he's sneaking up again. - Again! Get out!

I will not go! Let me alone! Let me alone! Let me alone! I won't go! Let me go! Take her directly to the bus! Let me go! Help! Let me go! I won't go! Little brat! Let me alone! - Bouzin. - Present! - Jollard. - Present! - Done. - What about me, sir? - What are you doing here? - I want to go. - Didn't I call you? - No sir. I want to go, too. - Name? - Rouffignac, Alain. - Born in Clermont-Ferrand. - Clermont-Ferrand? So we call him Bougnat. Since Clermont-Ferrand is in Africa. - Aren't you registered? - His parents don't want him to go. I wasn't talking to you. Are you registered or not? No sir. We can't handle this. We put her in one end and she goes out the other. Don't budge. Stay right there. - Let me go. - What can I do? Chuck her in with the boys and don't let her go. - Give her a beating! - I have an idea... I want to go and she doesn't. So I can go in her place. Kid... that would be too very simple. No, help! Help! I won't go! No, I beg you to leave me here! Well, have you decided you're staying put? Holy crap! She did that? What do you care! What's the matter? Don't you feel well? I'm dizzy. Do you want a candy? Leblanc, can you pass me the minty alcohol, please? Thank you. Here. Where are you going, pale face? - Bringing lunch to my mom. - Be careful, there are marshaling-yard maneuvers going on. - What are you doing here? - Nothing. - Where did you get this morning? - With some friends. What have you got in your bag? Nothing. - Where's the train you're washing going? - I don't know. - Well, goodbye. - Bye. Now boarding on the track 19... Direct... 1st and 2nd classes to Bretigny and Etampes. Etampes connecting to Orl?ans. Sir... I made a mistake. - What happened to you? - I got on the wrong train. - What happened? - We were all on the platform. - What station? - From Paris. Then what? I wanted to urinate, and I went to urinate. When I returned, they were gone. I shouldn't have gone to the bathroom. I saw a train pulling out. I thought it was the right one... and climbed on. It wasn't the right one, though. So here I am. It's not my fault, sir. Give me a ticket to Pontgibaud, so I can catch them up. Check to find a routing to Pontgibaud. Where's your vacation camp group coming from? Sarcelles. Hello? Get me the mayor of Sarcelles. What's your name? Me? Yes, you. If you are enrolled in their camp... ...they must have your name at the town hall. I have to ask them what to do with you. Will they take me to Sarcelles? They'll see. Well, do you have a name or not? Yes, I have. - Can you tell me? - My name's Leblanc. What? Are you making fun of me? - Your surname's Leblanc? - Yes, sir. Christian Leblanc. There's no station at Pontgibaud. He should get off at La Miouze. That's convenient. The 527 stops at Miouze. - We can send him to the station master. - We'll see. Hello? It's Sarcelles. Mayor of Sarcelles? This is Aubrays station. Aubrays. Near Orl?ans. Yes, there's a Christian Leblanc. Why was he on the train? The important thing is that we found him. That's what counts. In fact... Your Whitey... got pretty black! Black? Without a doubt... a cup of coffee will suit him well. Yeah, OK. Well, you'll get into the next train to Miouze. We'll notify the Mayor that you'll be arriving at the station. So that's it? - So I'm going to the camp right away? - I assure you. Great. It must be fate. Half an hour stop for lunch! What time is it? Wait! Come! - Hurry! - Come on, guys! Come on, guys. Come, come. You get down, too. - I'm not hungry. - The fresh air will do you good. - So this is what the countryside is like? - What did you think? Wow... we traveled 300 kilometers just to see this? Where are you going? Let's see. I have to have some relief, all right? And the people here, where do they live? - What? - Yes. - There aren't any houses. - No houses... There are flowers. I prefer plastic ones. Are you going keep stepping on my heels? I can't escape, there's no road! OK, I'll trust you. - But don't wander off. - No, I won't wander off, but I'll have some privacy. Henri, let's play! I can't do this! Come on guys! We're leaving in five minutes! Gather 'round. We're leaving in five minutes! Enough. Help! Help! Roland! It's Rose. I told you she'd run away. - She couldn't have gone far. - Rose! Rose! Help! Roland! Help! By God! Help! Roland! Help! Roland! Idiot! - What, you've never seen cows? - Yes. In the Villette slaughterhouse. Are we there yet? In about another hour. I'm sleepy. May I lean on you? You... kind of... saved my life. - Are you done? - Yes. Here. You can't say I don't like blacks. Come on, should I force you? There's no good food without a good pipe. Here, get this down before it rains. Hey, not so much. I'm responsible for him. I have to hand him over in good shape. Come along, I need you now. Can you walk yet? I prefer cigars. Touch here. Tickets, please. Want to see a magic act? It's your turn. Blow. Good. Drop it. Well, you won. Here, this is for you. - Strawberries? - Strawberries. Five kilos. I was told of a boy ten years old, on his own. A boy? Alone? I see only that one, Mr. Mayor. Him? Never would have guessed. Are you Leblanc? Are you that Christian Leblanc? Yes, I forgot. What I wonder is why you took the train... while the others came by bus. Because... For what? Because of my mother, who forgot my permission slip. And now you're bringing your permission? Sure. You can start looking for it, because here we are. Are you coming? - Wait, I'll check. - Check what? - The permission. - There's no time to lose. I'll vouch for you. Good morning, Mr. Mayor. How are you? I'm bringing Christian Leblanc. What? Roland! Summon Christian Leblanc! Leblanc, Christian. Here's Christian Leblanc. What? They phoned me from Sarcelles town hall about him. Other clerical error! Where is this Leblanc? It showed you mine,... you show me yours. Thank you, buddy. I'm not crazy! Leblanc, where are you? Mr. Mayor, what can I say? We've got everybody we should. It must be a prankster. I don't want to have any doubt. Leblanc! Where are you? We can call the gendarmes if you find it necessary. Only... These fucking boys. He hasn't broken anything or stolen anything. If I were you I'd let him stay, instead. We'll have to tell him. Well, I think there's nothing else to do. I'll see you, Mr. Mayor. Roland, bring them together in the refectory. Fuck. Go away. Leave me alone. Push off! Flic! Flic! Flic, come here! Flic, come here, boy! Children, wake up. Rise and shine! You there, stand to! Come on, wake up, girls. Everybody up. Sabine, Jeannette, Alice. Up we go. Rose! - She's gone. - Where is she? - She got up at night. - In the evening? Rose! Rose! - Have you seen Rose? - No, no. But... What are you doing there? Come on, wake up. One of them was snoring. Quick, into the shower. Ah! There come those. What's this? Your house? Flic! What happened to your house? Fuck a duck! - Parisian dog-heads. - Parisian, calf-heads. Come on, boys! Get by him! Back! Look out, Rose! Rose, the ball! Score! What a fool! I didn't do it on purpose. Get out of there! Now I'm the goalie. Piss off. I'm staying here. Stop it! Rose, are you crazy? Let her be. Well, I'm sick. - Where are you going? - I'm not playing anymore. Leave me alone! - No tantrums today, please. - Shit! All right, whatever. Let's move on. You're in goal. Damn! Pay attention! - Are you mad? - I'm fine, silly. - What? Repeat that. - Leave me alone. Brat. Paris scum. Dog's head! Come on, Bobet! Pingeon breaks free. Following in his tire marks, 200 meters from the finish... the cyclists are released. Who will win this stage? Bobet will win. Sure, granddad - it's ten years since he won. Never mind. This is the last kilometer... before reaching the top. The men seeking their places to decide... who wins the stage bonus... and the premium of one hundred thousand francs. Come on, Pingeon, come on! Come on, Poulidor! Stop him! Yes. Fast! He's not here! - Are you repeating yourself or what? - Leave me alone or I'll call Roland! - Let's see... - Roland! Here I am! My name's Roland! Right. I'm witness that you called. Parisian cow-head. Parisian dog-head. Parisian cow-head. Parisian dog-head. Timid bitch. Are all Parisians like you? Crap! She got away. Come on. She's no more than a brat. Rose! Bougnat. - What are you doing here? - You see... Wow! How did you pull this off? Well, it had to be done. And how did you do it? You traveled on your own? Wait... they're handing out money. Who? They already passed it around once. It's OK. Look. They bring it, so you took it. It's fine. I'll be back. You're completely insane. It's charity... and you robbed it. Hush, child. Shut up, kids! Let's go to the booth. They won't bother us. - You hitched a lift? - No, by train. - In the dining car. - And when you got to the camp... they didn't send you back? Nobody knows I'm here. Only the mayor and the cops... You talk about high acquaintances! They may hassle me... In fact, would you go check? What? Where? Cops are waiting for me outside. I can't. Some guys are stalking me. - Why? - Spring hornies, of course. Well, I'll look for your horny bastards and you look for the police. Yes, but that's... We can go. Your coin is false. You got a counterfeit coin. Don't rely on handouts. Now what will I eat? Well, I grabbed this. Well, it lacks butter. So I give you a sausage. But now you have to tell me. I got on a train and I told them I'd been lost. I didn't pay anything! To take the train... I'd never dare do that! Why would you take the train if you're already here? Precisely. I want to go back. Do it like I did. That's fine for you. With a girl, it's not the same. You don't you risk getting violated. Don't think about it. Also, I'm clumsy. In the city, I'm OK, but here, I'm lost. I know nothing of the countryside... their paths go nowhere. If only there was a metro. There are trucks. I feel sick! You know what would be nice? If we left together. Forget it! Why? Would you help me? You're smart, and here's the proof. The two of us together, we'd be less scared. We would say that you're my brother. What if I rape you? Thanks... as if you had a hope! How would you do that? Don't worry. I want to stay here. You're pretty crazy! The police are looking for you and you're instantly recognizable. Why? They haven't seen me. No, but you're black. Didn't anyone ever tell you that? OK, now what? I didn't say anything wrong. Yes. I know I'm black, but nobody told me that before. Because you live in the city. But you'll see how things are in the countryside. They'll grab you by your tail back to Africa with the lions. Or put you into a circus. You don't know them. And the police? What do I do if I'm arrested? They'll send you to Beaujon. - What's Beaujon? - I don't know. - But it looks like it hurts. - So... I can only throw myself into the water. Don't be a clown. Come back! Bougnat, come back. I'll help! I'll defend you! I'll give you what you want! Idiot. You're so stupid! What did you say you'd give me? Nothing! Well, yes. But I thought you were going to drown yourself. It was not my final word. Feed me every day. But I don't like bread, or ham or mashed potatoes or soft cheese. I'll see... And I want a uniform, because surely I can be recognized by... Why? by the fact that I don't have the same uniform as the rest. Come to the beach this afternoon. It won't be easy, but... If you think it's easy to jump into the water... It must be done. Well. See you this afternoon at the beach. Goodbye. It must be done! It's not bad here. Yes, but maybe we'll be sick of it in a month. A month? Damn! Come on, you fool. Go play. Go on. Beat it! Go away, stupid! Go with your masters! Go on. Go on. Get out of here! Push off, I haven't done any wrong to you. What about me, Roland? Can you teach me? Again? You know how to swim. No need to teach you. - What about me? - Hey Rose! Aren't you coming in? Take care of your girls. You don't need me. Bougnat! Bougnat! Rose, over here! Rose! What are you doing in there? I bare-ass naked. Have you got the clothes? There you go. Come on, there. Hurry. My clothes are missing. My clothes are missing. Roland, my clothes are gone. Look around for them. Open your eyes. Don't be overconfident. Go out this way. - Wow. I was wrong. - No, it's enough now. Come on. You're going to get us caught. Sit down. I have something to tell you... I did what you wanted. Sure. Now it's your turn. What do I have to do? - We'll leave together. - Where to? To Sarcelles. No. I didn't go through all this just to go back. You came, but you haven't joined the camp. Now I can go in. Ah, that's right. I did you a favor, and this is the way you thank me! I thank you. I thank you, but I won't go back to Sarcelles. - You don't want to go back? - No. - Then give me the clothes back! - What! Give me back the clothes! What are you deaf? Hand them over. Undress. No! Then I will take them myself. No! Help! - Shut up, idiot. - Help! Help! What? - Who's fighting? - Who's yelling? Help! Let me alone, you cunt! Help! Bougnat, what are you doing here? How did you get here? You see, if I'd wanted to, I could have betrayed you. And they'll send you straight back to Sarcelles. - Where are you staying? - It doesn't matter. Because I'm not snitch. But the first one who squeals on him, I'll smash his head. Who do you think we are? And you get out! - Can I keep these? - Bugger off! We'll arrange for you. This evening's meeting. Gather 'round, everyone, please. Come on, everybody gather together. Come on! Good... Quiet, please. The theme of the game: The supply truck... will break down on the way to Pontgibaud. We must find and repair it. - Come on, you. - Why me? You know how to talk. Your father is a city councilor. All right, all right. - Roland! - What? We have a complaint. - Can't it wait? - We can't play on field I consulted the kids and we want to build a cabin. Sorry, such things have to be arranged ahead of time. Everything is ready. Come! A cabin! A cabin! There! It's hidden there! - What now? - It's all over there. He disassembled the carburetor. - What do we do? - We keep it... and let them look for it. So we've got all afternoon. Quick, hide it! Children! Open your eyes! It shouldn't be much farther. Hey, there's Roland! I'll handle this. Guys, don't make any noise. Meanwhile, I'm gone. Rose! Stay here! - Come along with us! - No! Get back up. Wait five minutes. I can't. Five minutes. What's wrong with you? Why do you always want to be on your own? - I didn't want to come. - But you ARE here. You're not badly off. Let's begin again. I'm going! Listen: you want to go? Go! I'm no longer interested. Why, Roland? Were you interested? Anyway... But what's wrong? I don't know. There's no need to cry. Yes there is. Come on, calm down. Go back to the others and... I want to stay with you. But I won't leave you. I'll be with you. - Come along. - No! Listen... I'm with my kids, you do what you want. Don't go. What? Wait, I'll tell you everything. Guys, here comes Rose with Roland! We must take down the cabin. - Fast! - Hurry! Come on, hurry! That's it. Fast! What are you doing? Are you crazy? Roland, we found the carburetor. He had to have the cabin. Why destroy it? He's sworn to say nothing. Ah, fuck! Guys, have to start again. No. We don't feel like it. Bougnat! Hey, Bougnat! What a fool! You got the newspaper? What are you looking for? I want to see if there's a funeral. Oh, but if there isn't one? Pate. Always pate. Yes, but with gingerbread. It's the best I can do. - Goodbye. I'm going. - See you tomorrow. No, tomorrow's Julien. Is that some good chocolate? "Is that some good chocolate?" No more chocolate. Dear friends and staff,... prior to bonding according to the law... let me, personally... and being old friend his honorable family... of... Guard the door. No one leaves. So we meet again, right, Leblanc? Loitering. That concerns the juvenile court. In addition there was a robbery. A uniform theft. - They admit that. - No one has filed a complaint. In short, this is a matter for his family. We'll phone Sarcelles. We can take care for him at camp. If you take him... What? What? Free Bougnat! Free Bougnat! What are these cretins doing? Don't worry. I'll handle this. Free Bougnat! Free Bougnat! I can say yes. Watch out, they'll start burning the cars. VIVA SOLIDARITY WITH OUR BROTHERS OF COLOR WE'RE ALL BOUGNATS FREEDOM FOR ALL WE'RE OUTCASTS That's enough. What's the problem? It's definite that Bougnat will not stay in the police station. I came here with Roland just to pick him up. Tonight he'll be with us. He'd be with us now if you hadn't been so secretive... and if I'd been told that he was in the vicinity. Well, problem solved. Form up your groups, keep your signs, and go on back. Sorry, I ask your leaders... to arrange for your dispersion. Then we agree. We have shown our unanimous solidarity... and obtained the satisfaction of our claim. Not yet! Shut up! The demonstration is over. Stand down. There you go, boss. Enough! Go to dry. Here you go. We phoned Sarcelles. A social worker visited your mother... and she agrees, you can stay with us. Pay attention: here you're going to behave well... because it seems that isn't the first time you've run away. Where would you go if you go out from here? - Do you have other family in France? - No, sir. Well, no matter. You'll see your stay here will be OK. Moreover, you'll be staying later than the others. You can stay a second term. Why? Your parents will be going away for a while. Where will they be going, sir? On holiday, to Spain. I want to go along to Spain. We know! Your mom has a right to take a vacation. You took your own. It's always the same. Whenever I run off, they don't look for me. Because you're growing up. I want to go along to Spain. Come on, get to sleep and let the others sleep as well. Think of something else. Good night. We want to sleep! We want some peace! Go back to your cabin! Can't you see he's depressed...? No more! All their beds! Grab your pillows. Quit jumping around. - Sir, sir! They're hitting me. - No, they're playing. Come with me. The rest of you clean up and go to bed! Tonight you sleep with me. But don't cry. - Sir... - My name is Roland. - Roland... - What? Can I have your hand? All right. Now he's just for him. Tomorrow we're hiking to La Rochelle? Yes, tomorrow morning. Shit! I'll have to let you go. Why? Because you're such a drag. What's a drag? We'll stop here. I declare free activity. I have to go watch on that side. I'm with you. No. You keep watch over there. - Do it as a favor. - All right. Hey, Roland! - What? - Come with me. Let's trot! Faster! Faster! Faster! Faster! Faster! Fine... - I'm going to hunt. - You've got a rifle? No need. I'll hunt the unicorn. Me, too! - Have you ever hunted? - No. Here, it is not difficult. You get behind the bush... and when the unicorn passes you, you render a blow to the head. I'm going down. Roland! - What's the matter? - Josiane feels bad. Come along. I'm going with you. No. You stalk the unicorn. And don't budge. Imitate his call so one will approach. Like this: ... - Like that? - Perfect! - Now, where is she? - Come on. Whoa! That's funny. I thought she was right here. But she isn't. I'll relax. What does this mean? Sit down. It'll be better. I want you to kiss me. Rose, be serious. There are about 60 little kids here... I can't kiss everyone. - Just me. - I can't make exceptions. - Do you understand? - Yes. So... I want you to get me with child. What? You're a completely crazy thirteen! Thirteen and a half. And you don't understand anything! What would you do with a child? That's the whole point. At home, I take care of kids all the time... my brothers, sisters, nephews... ...even the neighbors'! When they find a kid on the street, they bring him to me! I'm sick of it! I want one of my own! Then they'd leave me alone! Maybe you're right, but I think that can wait. Rose, is that why you brought me here? - Yes. - What? To find out how. How do we make a child? Because you're an assistant teacher. That's not the case. Where's Josiane? - Josiane who? - Wasn't that true? - You've made me wrong! - Me? It was well done! - Rose! - Piss off! Bastard! Stupid! Fall in, fast. - Where's Bougnat? - Bougnat? Shit! Hey, little man, I forgot you. - The unicorn never came. - You weren't in any danger. It was just a joke. Come on. La Rochelle. One of the five refuges granted Protestants by Henry IV. The city was besieged in 1627 by the troops of Richelieu. The siege lasted more than one year, and more than 15,000 starved... of the 25,000 inhabitants. Those towers are the Great Clock and the Chain. At that time, there was strung between the towers a cable... that closed the entry to the bay in the afternoon, so the boats couldn't set sail. Moreover, when Richelieu was besieging the city,... he had built a dam 1,800 meters long to prevent English aid... from coming into the besieged city. But all that was at the time of Richelieu. Now let's have a swim at the beach. And then a picnic in the dunes. Can we switch to our swimsuits? Sure. Come on to beach! Come on, the water! Just run in the sand! - Are we ready? - Wait a minute. Everyone's in the water. No one will see us. Yes, but how can we do this? It would be nice to take a boat. I've traveled by train, truck, and car, but never by boat. - How about you? - Me neither. Are we going? What if we eat with everyone else? It seems we'll have chicken legs. They have a lot of bone. Well? You decide. Do you want Roland to grumble or not? Yeah. Make up your mind, because I'm going... Goodbye. Wait. - What'll we eat? - Don't worry. Knock it off! Look what we're going to have. That sucks. Sir, could you cook this for us? No, because it would spoil my chips. Hey, it's pretty good! And the others are eating legs! And my carrots, maybe they're not very good. What's wrong? That's better. Listen, we're losing time. We'd better notify the police. Do you think they're smarter? We must focus on the port. You go over there. You check the streets arriving here. And I'll handle the other side. Come on. The first ten with me. What about the picnic? Right away, as soon as we find the others. I'm worse. I think I've had it. I didn't come along just to take care of you! As you know, I'm fed up to the brim... And now you smell fishy. Go wash! I have nothing to dry. Then keep back! Rose! Now what? My tummy hurts. - I crapped my pants. - No! I'm sick. I wanted a man but ended up with a child. I can't stand any more of this. I'm going back. And how are you going to do that? You don't know where you are. Do you? You don't know even where we were going. Yeah - Let's go by boat. This moves all the time. It's not the boat moving, it's just the water. You know, Bougnat. Maybe we were mean to him. Who? Roland. He must be looking everywhere for us. Maybe we should go back. Really. If you're chickening out, just say so. I'm not chickening out. I think I know what's happened. You changed your mind. Yes, I changed my mind. Chicken. Chicken! Come on, get out of here and go back. I wonder how you'll get along without me. I'll have one less butt to clean! That's a big plus! Well. Bougnat, wait! Wait up! Bougnat, tell me - why do you always want to escape? You always want to leave. I thought it was because of your parents, but even here you're doing it again. I don't know. I think I'd like return home. But where is your home? I don't know. In any case, it's never where I am. And you, why do you want to go? Me? You know that at first it was just to return to Sarcelles. And now, why it is? Now... - It's just to annoy someone. - Oh, right. Bougnat... - How about we take the train? - To cross the sea? Cross the sea? Cross the sea to go to America. America is there in the distance. But what do you want in America? I've never seen it. I'd go with you. But I'm afraid of boats. I'd like someplace less far away. Somewhere we can go by car. Well if you want, we won't go by boat. Rose, no one's driving. Come on. Ladies and gentlemen. This may be the first time... for visiting ?le de R?... and you may not know all its opportunities. The Union Palace is to your left, will look familiar to you. The next boat will leave in approximately 10 minutes... It's moving. It's not moving, but it's shaking. It's not turning. - Turning? - Not anymore now. It was rolling a while ago... and now it's only moving. Bougnat, we're not moving, but everything else is. You're crazy. Shit, we're on a boat. Help, I don't want this. Roland! Help, Roland! - Roland! - Where are you going? - There's a ruckus. - Ruckus? Yes, there are people over there. Rose... Are you OK? I'm cold. Where is Bougnat? She doesn't remember anything else. Tell me, Roland. Can I have a kiss? Not even today? Is that all? At least they gave me mouth-to-mouth... Hey, girl... Are we on America? MINISTRY OF JUSTICE You brought me the newspaper sports section? Your Poulidor did well. - Guys, let's unload. - Yeah. There's somebody here. Yes, on that side. Can you see him? What were you doing there? - F3. - No. - B17 - No. - A12. - Hit. - A13. - Hit. - Tomorrow we'll go back to Sarcelles? - No. Tomorrow is the holiday camp festival. The day after tomorrow. You should get up right away. I'll see you in Sarcelles? Sure. A little later. I'm staying there until August. Other children will be coming instead. But can't I stay? You didn't want to come and now you want to stay. Yes, but I didn't know you. But if I AM sick, can I stay? JULY 29 HOLIDAY CAMP Are you sure, then? Won't you come and see? I'm sick. What's happening at the party? We dance, we sing... There's even a magician. I'm sick. Maybe even tomorrow I won't be able to get up. We'll check with the boss. Well, see you later. We'll take our friend Huguette. She'll enter this one place and will pass through to the other. And for that we need for all your help. To send her, blow in your hands and... It may not be enough. Murderer! Are you coming to Germany? Yes, yes. Germany. Let's go to your camp. Not the camp, no. I want to go to Germany with you. No! - You want to be our comrade? - Yes, you and me, comrades. Crap! What are we doing here? You should go straight to Germany. Yes, comrade. What, comrade, what? You said... Fuck! It's not fair. Leave me alone! It's Bougnat! Stop! Huguette, where are you? And now we'll do the reverse operation. But for this operation... I need you to blow more strongly. No, no! That's a pretty feeble blow! For Huguette to return, it takes more strength. More! The operation is carried out! Thank you. Let's check whether it was enough. And now let's see if we succeeded. Bougnat! Hey, Guy! It's all fixed for Bougnat. We'll keep him here. But I'll watch him like a hawk. Now the problem is the sick girl. She must have swallowed some oil! Careful, silly! Come. - Roland, bye. - Have a good trip. I want to go on the bus. You'll have other friends who will be here tomorrow. - I wanted to go to Germany. - I know... - Goodbye! - You can go. Goodbye, kids! Bye, everyone! Goodbye. Until next year. Rose! Bougnat! Bougnat! Bougnat! Here's the ones going home. - Jocelyn. - Yes? Are they the ones going into the camp? Yes. Go on. Goodbye. - You're not waiting for someone? - No! Let's go! There goes Rose! She's going back! Rose Bornand is doomed! Rose, Rose, Rose. Bougnat, don't go. Goodbye, goodbye, Rose. Tomorrow. I'm going to my distant country. You always want to go far... not even knowing... the performers' path. And then you don't dare... because I'm not going with you. You will always be Bougnat.
