i offer you a jaffa cake no thank you cheese puff no no it's fine so why are you listening to another radio station oh scout the competition anyway after your little ordeal in there i think it's better if you stay in your comfort zone we took a risk on you being in prime time well with all due respect sir hans was pushing me to the edge you you basically called him a nazi well not directly it's probably best for you to stay back in the graveyard shift where you belong i'm sorry it's just already been a long day please shout the door on your way out Jason! oh hey hey how'’d it go in there did you give me your wow factor you get the job Were you not listening to the broadcast? no why i kind of lost my call elvis um no what what happened you know just for research purposes i called

you call it the graveyard shift you are an idiot where is everyone what's this all about okay if you're just tuning in now we've just got word that the capsule found in Frankfurt early this morning

until further developments tabloid crap you're joking right this sounds fucking serious zombies I could take him shut the fuck up ow sounds pretty dangerous I'’m going home jason what the bloody hell

this because lunch is late oh come on i'm working my ass off down there stop it how oh come on calm down guys why have we gotta be like this Where's Hans? he's gone we have to go i'm sorry carl we've

i'm gonna help him no jesus well that wasn't very good that wasn't very good at all on a completely unrelated note i know this is probably bad timing but it's anyone else quite hungry oh oh my god bloody zombies i knew sir you're on my desk oh well in that case okay team it appears we're in a bit of a pickle my brother just died and you're calling this a pickle mike do you like pickles i do but this you know this is this is quite this is a bad situation as i was saying a bit of a pickle in this trying time we must be brave we must be vigilant we need a leader someone who we can look up to someone who will not be scared and will not shy away from any test in troubling times such as these we must unite oh sir um will you lead us then what no i can't do it i've got a bloody business to run what well how can i be the new co-presenter if i'm already the fucking president co-presenter sir we're in crisis yes michael crisis we're a presenter down but what about the zombies shut up jason and get that ham off your face you know what i'm about to say merkel your prime time lad but i'm not going to let you do it alone michael i'm going to be auditioning every interested candidate to be

thought i'd give this a go i'm eric i work in it i've never seen this man before in my life okay i see you're bored i know exactly what you need you need someone who is charismatic knows the music industry you need someone with balls and i've got balls no please don't please don't do it if you reach out so i feel like my my kind of involvement in this company after working here for 12 long fucking years um that i would really be suited for this new position of a fucking radio presenter um and you know i i i know this company inside now like your mum's vagina and um i think you should fucking stop that cunt hello sir hello sam what's your name my name is charles jason sideline this atrocity of a human being is also called charles did you know we hired this man actually no don't answer that i'm sick of you being so shoddy at your job what have you even been writing this whole time show me your notes jason please go be more productive somewhere else and take this fucking imposter with you oh so you nervous me oh no no this is legacy and besides i'm going up against a bunch of fucking rejects and a caterer the biggest of them all you raise a good point so you don't think i'll get it no i think a fucking performing monkey has a better chance of getting a job in radio than you go back to the kitchen hawaii five fucking 0 and let the real talent do their job yeah well i do like food and yeah well the radio voice kind of yeah that's my throat yeah yeah all right don't fuck off okay so we need to get some food everybody take a set of desks and find what you can just so you know we're not happy about giving up our food so we have off-brand brown flakes two ready meals packet of polos um sorry not quite a packet of polos the director's bananas frozen vegetables um oh g-strings okay so the water's still running there's no problem there but even with all this food it's only gonna last us about half an hour so that any volunteers go down to the kitchen get some more well i know the layout pretty well and i know all the best things to get so maybe i should go okay but it's probably best if you take someone with you can i help maybe not you simon you know with your arm how did you do that by the way um I I fell yeah anyone oh maybe I should go but it's way too scary I don't know it's dark i can finally prove myself to Mr. H uh I mean Mr. Haverford I'’ll go oh um we're sending those two out there's nothing wrong with that okay cool the lights are all off probably best to save power so Elvis where's the food where's the delicious food

reminded her of her dad charles she said i'd like it ah stay strong you know be positive all that stuff you know to play more fish in the sea yeah you're you're all right all right i'm gonna go and see if i can go and open the blind get some light in here hey elvis what's with this dog oh i just died yeah you did wait what are we gonna do about that i don't think it's in our best interest i don't think it's in anyone's best interest to go and stab a bunch of zombies someone's got to be the hero no no no elvis no elves don't elvis i could be the hero how about instead we box this up completely and don't tell anyone about anything agreed food hmm what the hell i think there's noise in here hello hello how are you oh good thanks i mean given the circumstances i almost just died but

plummeted we need some new ideas to spice the pan and until we've got a brilliant breakthrough that will make this company millions we're not leaving this room what about lunch and what about bathroom breaks eat paper piss yourself i don't care people i want ideas okay so i've been sitting on this one for a while so i think we need to interact with our listeners more you know so i thought maybe we could introduce a q a section to the show you know where fans just call it michael i hate to stop you of all people in the middle of a sentence but how much writing is on that paper um that's it i've got it well boy don't keep it locked up tell us characters what characters what like ace ventura pet detective wait wait elvis you can't just say the word again you have to explain what you mean well i can do voices lots of accents etc maybe we could put some of those in the show i know i'm going to regret asking this but can you give us some examples um yeah hello i am bjorn ironfood and this is s-rock radio yeah elvis i'm not going to lie to you but i fucking love that idea you mean you love it no no i loathe it you mean love loathe i'm hearing love i'm not saying love i'm saying low are you

shit i think we can all agree that was bloody horrifying and won't be used in our show that isn't the bathroom to this building how long have you had that okay that's enough more ideas people come on what about anyone else how i still don't care what why is this happening how what is it that you do around here he's our field reporter one of the best damn journalists we've got around this place it's okay hal you got me ideas you just yell them out don't stress yourself though yeah i wasn't going to anyways what boring thing to report about fields i've got it wow this will be good radio dramas they're always popular wait hang on in what universe are radio dramas popular thanks mai but probably best to leave this to the professionals you know the ones who didn't get the job because their predecessor died carl where are you going oh uh i thought with the whole predecessors thing you know jerry news jerry bit awkward but jerry didn't die he moved to australia oh yeah of course he did anyway back to my idea radio dramas oh right well i'm sorry i just didn't realize that our audience were 900 fucking years old i'm intrigued so after my original broadcast it got a lot of attention both good and bad he's over there get him not today partner he's over there fire Engage well that was messy But in short the only broadcasting radio Anyone? literally any idea at all what about no anything Charles listen what did you just say to me sir i'm i'm sorry for raising my voice but i'm a little tired of you not letting me voice my opinions okay i'll humor you let's hear your bright idea does everyone want to hear jason's bright idea okay we're all listening okay well i've compiled a list of well off the top of my head inspirational quotes this will be good such as oh i've got a good one always be your best you um the only ship that won't sink is friendship nope stupid for god's sake let's just go with mike's idea we'll get people to do q a at home it's that simple how

unite and find a way to find a way to get rid of them so does anyone have any ideas on how we can solve this issue oh oh okay elvis go maybe we should ask the texts they seem like they'd be good at killing things text killers i could drop those nerds in a second elvis do you want to go and grab him okay what now oh fine i will go as i seem to be the only stable one around here seriously you um yeah what about that time that you screamed obscenities at a five pound note because the queen looked at you funny jeanette please how about when you cried at march of the penguins hey come on that film is an emotional roller coaster they're birds that want to be fish see my point none of us here are entirely stable given the circumstances whatever someone needs to go and everyone here is currently driving me insane hey guys i know it's late but see we've got a bit of an issue one of the pro there must be something i can do to destroy these bastards hi carl what what do you want you consider us friends right no okay well i consider you a friend friend excellent i don't care right well i've been thinking about the zombie issue for a few days now and i think it's a simple fix what we only found out about the zombies a few hours ago well jason and i knew about them since we went to get food from the pantry and you didn't tell anyone we were frightened well that elvis gives me an idea why don't you come join the meeting then i'd rather not i need to plan something okay see you later then oh my god mike but buddy you okay the text this there's something there's something wrong with them i told you sorry oh my god mike just pull yourself together and everyone else working together to come up with a collective solution to solve the problem is the only way we're going to survive well we need something that's you know like long and thin and stabby that we can just we can just them with you know such as well what about this thing oh there's no what what about fire that does not sound safe well we get one of the food boxes we fill it with paper and other flammable stuff and we just throw it into the kitchen that's great a great way to burn down the whole station elvis you're really more of a doer than a thinker thanks well i don't see you coming up with any more ideas jeanette i don't know there's another way into the lobby maybe someone could bait them outside that is crazy plus who's gonna go for that really that's pretty damn racist guys oh no we didn't mean oh we were just looking that way it was really just a coincidence oh good because you know what happens to all those black guys in the horror movies i wouldn't last a second okay well it's still a terrible idea we're not putting one of our own at risk you know i'm still thinking my weapon idea is golden weapons does anyone have a gun if i had a gun i'll use it on all of you we need to just think of all the possibilities don't we i'm going to go to the bathroom because that's where i get some of my best thinking done and by the time i get back i want to see some ideas okay i'm still with fire this won't do shit empty you've had a gun this whole time but that's not really what's important at the moment it's empty so are you here to make more of your weird comments Karl no michael i just thought you might want to know something about your little friend elvis okay so it turns out he knew about this zombie dilemma since the very start hey what hang on no elvis wouldn't do that why don't you talk to him and find out yourself okay carl you know you're a dick right yeah just stop hanging out in the men's bathroom because it's it's really creeping people out mike we're sorting it oh really i didn't expect that so soon what's the plan then just gonna leave them leave the zombies the bloodthirsty man-eaters yeah like you said it's not so much but one of our own at risk and it's not an immediate problem i assume zombies have to eat so eventually they'll either clear off or starve that actually makes sense have you you've seen elvis hey buddy what's up did you know about the zombies in the kitchen beforehand oh yeah oh elvis what the hell what do you mean what the hell you knew about the human eating monsters in our building and you didn't think to tell anyone didn't think it was that important how how could you possibly think that it's not that important they could literally devour us in seconds and you didn't think it was important elvis you put everyone at risk and i know sometimes you can be stupid but this this is something else mike why why are you being like this because elvis this was just idiotic i'm so angry with you i'm livid come on buddy how about i buy you dinner tonight make it up to you in the early hours of this morning i received a disturbing email attached was a sickening image which i can only assume has been passed around the office to humiliate i don't want to out the person but what i will say is that it was of the naked variety but our leader of hr maria stop it and i will be leading a full investigation and seminar into finding out who the scoundrel was that did it oh i thought charles was going to be here for the interviews too yeah charles didn't really work out oh so it's just me friendly maria from hr i sent charles to do the seminars is that a good idea jeanette told me she slept with someone at that party and it's my job to find the sick guy who sent that picture of her what yes and since you're her husband well technically ex-husband not what i've got written down i think there's been some crossed wires anyway since you're her ex-husband you are prime suspect um why would i want to sleep with janette i mean we're not even together anymore and between you and i everything's confidential mike she's a bitch crikey okay anyway you can ask elvis we were together that night mike mentioned me yes did he seem happy we just answered the question elvis oh yeah we were together that night we cuddled we did not cuddle okay mike look we know we went through a bit of a rough patch but best friends always make it through these kinds of things just leave me alone elvis mike was what i did really that bad you neglected to tell us that zombies had flooded the building we're still in the same position as we were in before i'm not talking to elvis i don't i don't want to hear your voice we have our show to do in 10 minutes but then i'm not talking to you hello um eric eric yes eric, Eric from from eric from it are the worst hr manager yeah uh so where were you the night of the party oh um simon andrew and i we were having a blast look i don't know about anything you're asking me but while you're here you've got to help me eric and andrew are psychopaths they've been experimenting with me in that room got that room yeah um simon makes a lot of stuff up i think he's got chronic lois disease or something but you don't know anything about the email um no right can i get back to work now wait can't you just check the email service holy should i tell you i'm fine don't worry they're just acting out macbeth i'll get to checking the emails now promise me you're not going to yell at me during this no no just be quiet i want to listen to the music how how did you find out about the thing carl told me not that it's important okay and that song was punk rocker for a day by single bullet theory here at s rock radio we like to bring you the best tunes and the best chats live throughout the day here at s rock radio we are a pretty tight community i wouldn't say the people working here with me are my colleagues i would say that they are my friends yes but i don't see how that's relevant you know i feel like it's it's really important for the fans to get a real feel of what's going on around here you know stimulate all the senses okay fine yes we here at srock radio are a close community with a few minor exceptions mike i really don't want to go into this right now i think we should anyway listeners here are some adverts but we'll be right back with you very shortly elvis what the hell was that mike i just want to be friends again it's nice having someone to come to with all your problems don't you agree yes i agree but not when that person does nothing for you in return i don't understand elvis just go i i'd rather you weren't here right now fine i'll go and make friends with someone else safety in the workplace by me your leader and dreamweaver charles r haverford safe what does it stand for s feeling a safe f in your e professional work environment um that doesn't seem like it holds up please in this three-hour seminar i will explain why you are wrong and i am right okay i'm going to need to speak to jason next i really don't think it's jason talk to me next you know anything to get me out of this shit well fuck this i'm going bye you wanted to get this over pretty sharpish anything you want to say yeah okay what good one you know we take things like this pretty seriously carl um isn't that a half empty bottle of wine by your feet you know right right there carl just confessed you got the most reasons to do this michael already gave a convincing alibi which was he said i was with elvis and jeanette is a bitch yeah true and anyway what better way to get back at mike than to sleep with his ex-wife again true so you're gonna confess and that's why i got decommissioned from naam any questions no no questions till the end so we found the culprit and i warn you this will not be taken lightly we all know that the picture was of jeanette's what shh sherlock's doing her work but sherlock's a man zing shut the fuck up anyway the uh picture was of jeanette so really there is only a handful of people it could be a handful of people that were stooped so low as to sleep with her hey i mean who could get someone like you sister not better my prime suspects were mike and carl and mike's alibi was airtight he said you were a bitch hey you said that was confidential you actually said that maria yeah i just slipped out i'm such a gossip wait so who was it it was carl i said that so at the end of the day it was all elementary my dear what please please stop that hang on carl you slept with my ex-wife wife technically not important also it wasn't carl and mike did you seriously call me a bitch he's got a point and of course it was you were just too drunk to remember oh so you raped my ex-wife that makes things so much better everybody shut up it was me you slept with jeanette no no it was me it was jason oh fuck we were very drunk at the party and and it's not a regular thing and and mike i'm really sorry and you sent her picture i am so confused oh no now it makes sense the picture wasn't of jeanette it was jason okay now is the time any questions i think we found ourselves a new own boys the building looks secure from here with these weapons we'll siege it in no time uh boss i think my gun is jammed did you leave the safety on yeah i think i have done more on right we'll rest here tonight and take the station tomorrow at dawn but wouldn't it be easier to just sneak in during the night we've been watching too many movies kiddo we need our strength we rest and eat tonight we make our attack tomorrow make sure you don't leave any ammo lying around you don't think it's going to take that much firepower to overthrow them do your boss yeah we've seen their show they don't seem all that smart never underestimate these goons are just the faces of the company i bet whoever's running it's a bloody lunatic come on jason jason come us you on fucking idiot bye oh no no i demand a rematch oh we won fair and square now give us the cheesecake heatherford you sh you donkey nugget sucking *Rambling continues* stop bleeping me wow guys now that was something special look i'm trying to make some new friends uh and i know you used to be a trio until the other guy horrifically died excuse me sir um how do you keep changing suits out of my way michael i'm sulking why shut up sorry old boy just a little tied down at the moment got pressing matters at hand like the fact that i've got a useless wheelie chair race partner um with all due respect sir there are still zombies in the building that do need to be dealt with ah yes the insects scuttling around the place like they pay rent i put my heart and soul into this company michael and nobody around here takes it seriously what the hell was that probably the wind or a bug or something i don't care anymore i'll get a grip i beg y'all are you gonna stop whining like a little shit and finally admit that the world is fucked the rest of us have come on we need to start actually acting like we want to survive and we can start by investigating whatever the hell that noise was okay fine if it'll humor you shit it's actually quite nice in here i don't know it could do with a bit of a hoover shut up so where do we start boss you boys better stick together we don't want this one getting in trouble or doing the fucking housework right boys off you go if you find anything radio me i'm gonna see if i can take him down from the top come on see michael i told you it was nothing fine but you know you can never be too careful considering the circumstances well whatever what if any cocky bastard tried to sabotage my radio station such as mark from 101.5 i'd give him the old do-over with this beauty oh my god wait that's not another stapler is it you tell me jesus christ beautiful isn't she mortal back from now oh sheila wait so you're telling me that you've had firearms in this office the entire time we could have been defending ourselves we could have prevented multiple casualties please michael don't ever react you don't need firearms to solve a rodent problem oh stop it they are flesh eating monsters they will kill you in seconds if they get the chance how many guns do you have in there lots lots what does lots mean i mean i've got a fucking armory in this draw so mike's told us that you have weapons oh i didn't know you're carrying concealed weapons sir i have more than one they're different sizes and colors too we start with sheila a pg-13 an h2o a stabby stabby a wd-40 an e45 a hitty hitty stick another stabby stabby an orb mr and mrs h oh and this oh we each get a gun that way if intruders try to storm the station we have maximum protection oh okay oh oh you idiot i'm not mad jason i'm just disappointed oh thank god okay no now i'm mad just take your weapons and bagger off out of my office i've never held a gun before it's heavier than i thought jesus jason we've got one in pink no no pink oh compensating for something jason is now the time really to be making penis jokes no i was talking about your arms skinny arms he is right there you are unbelievably skinny wait where's the ammo the ammo great no guns then oh shit who were they mark from 101.5 I knew it right everyone quietly quietly follow me out of the office hey boss they're over there fire at them boys boss roma's move come on quick hurry get inside go quicker go well that was close mike i just wanna no elvis don't i'm sorry for getting so angry i know you're scared we all are i hope you can forgive me for getting so mad boys wait where did you go i'm losing faith here i'm starting to think this was a bad idea shit he was right behind us as following well he's not here now is he jeanette why do you think i'm in charge of everybody you're the boss everyone knows you're the controlling one who does everything around here i'm just the one who funds this mickey mouse clubhouse stop arguing they're going to hear us i agree in the trench enough about the war elvis you seem to be the only person who's thinking logically around here stop making that noise mike's right we've got to be quiet i recognize that whiny and muffled voice anywhere open the door why do you recognize it as muffled probably best not to ask did you see any people there i'm pretty sure that was just zombies well well if it's only zombies i'm gonna re-suggest a jabbing idea whatever you've got to do you'd better do it fast hello hello i've been trying you guys for hours now hello jason you have to tell us what happened he's not well michael can't you see what if he's been bit what's a harmless bug bite going to do but sir then don't you're only going to stress charles out if you put the idea of jason turning into his head agreed but we do need to think about a way out of here what about this vent so who's going in there it's going to be a tough job it'll have to be someone small and slender guys stop i know what you're suggesting someone brave strong slender I'’ll go no no no no michael it'll either have to be you or jeanette for god's sake can you repeat that elvis i said no code names and why you mighty elephant elvis elvis you there you have to say over over let's tell stories why to keep the mood up what kind of stories i don't know anyone got anything in the chamber speaking of chambers in the trenches uh jeanette how did your mic meet we met at bar and he asked me to dance it's only a few years ago actually things pass so soon it's weird to think about oh all right i hope everyone else is okay does anyone know why carl went you all know why he didn't get the job as co-presenter right no why he cried in the audition it only been about a day since he lost his brother yet the guy tried for it yes he's a creepy fucker hangs around in bathrooms women's or men's wears women's clothes and let's be honest there's probably a long list of reasons why he's so creepy but that guy's tougher than you think he's been through hell and he's remained strong things are getting deep in here i think we need more stories oh boy i think what you need to do is help me i'm coming to the end of the event now mike that event ends in the kitchen it's the only place i've ever seen another one like it over i'm sorry i didn't expect there to be so many of them where are you hello hello oh shit oh no I'’m not sure this is just a bug bite i don't think jason's gonna last much longer give
