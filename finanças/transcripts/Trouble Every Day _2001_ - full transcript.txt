Yeah. It's so geometrical, it's like a computer chip. To Mr. and Mrs. Brown. I'm happy. Are you happy? I'm happy. Can I get you some water, sir? No, thanks. Sir? Sir? Is everything allright, sir? I'm Mr. Brown. Mr. and Mrs. Brown. Quite so, Mr. Brown. Dr. Brown. A double room with king size. - Very good. - Hi, I'm Mrs. Brown. Welcome to Paris, Mrs. Brown. I hope you enjoy your stay. Here is your key. Room 321, third floor. The elevator is immediately on your left. Can we have somebody help us with our luggage, please? - Right away, Mr. Brown. - Thank you. - Are you okay? - I'm okay. Hello? Hello? Hello, can anybody hear me? Can someone answer? Hello? Hello? Can you hear me? Hello? Can someone answer? Hello? Okay. Thank you. Thank you. Are you frightened? Who were you calling? Some boss in a lab. I should have told you before we left. I couldn't say no. I probably have to have dinner with him. That's all. What? Let's go. No, Dr. Semeneau doesn't work here anymore. I told you so in my fax. I run this service now. I really need to find him. Please. I really need to find him. Please. I know he just left town overnight without a trace or a word of warning. He just up and left. We haven't heard from him since. He just left with no number, nothing? - No contact? Nothing? - No, not even a postcard. - That's hard to believe. - Yes, I know. I'm sorry. To tell you the truth, I don't understand what you're after. I mean, you work for a big lab. What could someone like you want with Semeneau? He wrote a paper a couple years ago. My company's interested in that paper. You know the paper I'm talking about. Yeah. Yeah, I threw it away long ago. Listen, I don't buy that stuff for one second. You know, in this service we have been mapping out the human brain for years on end. So as for Leo Semeneau's discoveries, don't make me laugh. Now the truth of the matter is that Semeneu is no longer part of the scientific community. Try the talk show circuit. Maybe. Are you not feeling well? No. Do you want a glass of water, or something? Yes, please. Thank you. I've had a lot of caffeine today. It's giving me a headache. Oh yeah... caffeine... Are you feeling better? Yeah? Good. I hope you haven't come all this way for such nonsense. I'm on my honeymoon. How nice. I'm sorry. I didn't see you were there, so... It's okay. Excuse me. After graduate school, a lot of companies made offers to me. Universal PharmaCon made me the best offer. You like money, don't you? So what? Can we get out of here? It smells. And the light... I don't like it here. No, it helps me. So, you read Leo's articles. His index of forrest. Studies of pharmacopoeia. I convinced my boss to take an interest in a little Frenchman working on a shoestring budget. That's all. I went to Guyana and broght some supplies and some money. He'd assembled a great team there. Each one was the best in their field. And then there was Leo. Right. And Corè. Right. Corè Cordrin. Mrs. Leo Semeneau. That's right. You were in love with her? It's not the right word for it. I was attracted to her. She was so stubborn. You became lovers? I wish we had. Do you believe in loyalty, Mr. Brown? What about betrayal? What's your stance about betrayal, Mr. Brown? You were not there. You don't know what happened. You don't know me. You're wrong. Wasn't I? Semeneau was against experimenting on human beings. And you knew it. But... Huge profits were to be made, Mr. Brown. And you like money. And you're a man in a hurry. So, you stole Leo's work. Now get out of here. Get off. Please. Bye, Mr. Brown. Hello. This is him. There's something I want to tell you. But... I can't tell you now. I can't talk here. Tell me where to go. I'll come and meet you. Could we meet tomorrow? - Okay. What time? - Shane. Okay. I would never hurt you. I like you, June. I like you, too. - Hello, I don't want to come in. I have... - You're late. Yes, I know. I'm sorry. Could you walk with me? There is a strike in there. I don't have much time. You know, I know where Semeneau works. You know? You can find him here. How did you get that? You know, I did this... I'm helping you Because Leo needs a friend. And I was thinking when I saw you that maybe... Maybe you... His wife is sick. - Corè's sick? - Yes, very sick. He works at home, you know, to be able to take care of her. Are you okay? Are you okay? Do you want me to help you? You're so sick... You're sick... I'm sick... I'm sick... I'm sick... I'm sick... Hey... Hey. Hey! Hey, come on! Come on... Shane! Shane! Shane! Shane... You lied to me! Good evening, madame. Good evening. Thank you. Thank you... Wouldn't you prefer to wait inside? You'll keep warm. - Okay. Yeah. - Please. This way. Okay. Good night, madame. Thank you. June Brown. It sounds nice together. It's a good name. This was my parents apartment. I never wanted to leave. It's my neighborhood. I'm disappointed not to see Shane. I'm sad. Yeah... He's been busy with conferences... I've hardly seen him myself. You could have a dinner. Before there was no need to beg him to come to it with us. Give me a cigarette. Well, I just have to accept it. It's nice to meet you. He would have found me older anyway. Back then we looked the same age, but... Over the past few years... I was short on money, so I was glad to rent a room to Shane. I was surprised when he called. June? This is for Shane. Just a few things I found after he left. You'll probably throw it in the garbage once you get outside. I throw nothing away. It all keeps piling up. This is Leo. And this is Shane. Has he changed much? I wouldn't know. Hello! Hello! Who are you? Who are you? Shane! Shane? Shane. How you feeling, doc? I feel good. Come here. I want to go home.
