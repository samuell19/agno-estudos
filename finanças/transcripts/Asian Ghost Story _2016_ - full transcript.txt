VANCOUVER ISLAND, CANADA. WHILE COLONISTS CLEAR ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE CONTINENT FOUGHT FOR THEIR INDEPENDENCE IN THE LATE SEVENTEEN-HUNDREDS, BRITISH FUR TRADERS BROUGHT SCORES OF CHINESE WORKERS HERE TO BUILD THEIR SHIPS AND DOCKYARDS. THEY WERE PROMISED THE CHANCE TO SETTLE IN THE AMERICAN COLONIES. INSTEAD, THEY WERE SEIZED BY SPANISH SOLDIERS WHEN THE SETTLEMENT AT TERMINUS COVE WAS ATTACKED. NO ONE KNOWS WHAT BECAME OF THEM. OVER 100 YEARS LATER, THE CHINESE RETURNED TO THIS REGION, HIRED FROM CALIFORNIA AND CHINA TO WORK ON THE CANADIAN RAILWAY. THEY WERE PAID A THIRD OF WHAT THEIR WHITE COUNTERPARTS EARNED FOR THE SAME WORK, AND OFTEN FORCED TO LIVE IN TENTS ALONG THE TRACKS THESE TENTS DID LITTLE TO PROTECT THEM FROM THE HARSH WEATHER, AND THE TREACHEROUS TERRAIN. MANY OF THEM DIED, THEIR BODIES BURIED WITHOUT CEREMONY. THEIR LIVES - AND EFFORTS - FORGOTTEN. SOME SAY THEIR SPIRITS STILL HAUNT THE ABANDONED RAILWAYS, SEEKING VENGEANCE. AND OTHERS SAY THAT THE INJUSTICE VISITED UPON THEM HAS AWAKENED AN EVEN OLDER SPIRIT. A WARRIOR THAT WAS BROUGHT HERE ACROSS THE PACIFIC HUNDREDS OF YEARS AGO. ONE THAT WILL NOT SLEEP... BRING THEM TO TERMINUS COVE. HELLO? EMMA, IT'S WALT. I'VE BEEN WANDERING AROUND FOR ABOUT AN HOUR NOW. YOU'VE BEEN WANDERING AROUND FOR AN HOUR AND YOU'RE JUST NOW CALLING ME? WELL, IT FEELS LIKE AN HOUR, AT ANY RATE. NEVER MIND. WHERE ARE YOU? IF I KNEW, I WOULDN'T BE WANDERING. I GOT OFF THE FERRY AND TOOK THE OLD LOGGING ROAD EAST. YOU SAID EAST, SO... I'VE BEEN AT THE FERRY DOCK ALL AFTERNOON. WHICH ONE? 'WHICH ONE'? ARE YOU SERIOUS? TERMINUS COVE. YOU MIGHT REMEMBER IT FROM WHEN I TOLD EVERYONE, 'MEET ME ON THE DOCK AT TERMINUS COVE'? THERE'S LIKE THREE DIFFERENT FERRIES THAT LEAVE FROM THE MAINLAND. I'M SORRY, I TOOK THE FIRST ONE I COULD FIND. TERRIFIC. IF YOU TOOK THE WRONG ONE, CHANCES ARE, SO DID EVERYONE ELSE. WELL, DON'T WORRY, THEY'LL CALL. NO, THEY WON'T. ONCE YOU GO INTO THE FOREST, CELL PHONE RECEPTION TURNS TO CRAP. THAT'S WHY I HANDED OUT THE WALKIE-TALKIES. WELL, THAT'S GOOD NEWS, RIGHT? US TALKING ON CELL PHONES? THAT MEANS I CAN BE TOO FAR OUT IN THE WOODS. YEAH, YOU'D HAVE TO BE A MILE FROM THE SHORE, TOPS. DO YOU HAVE A MAP? IN MY BACKPACK. CAN I USE MY PHONE? WELL DIG IT OUT. YOU KNOW I'M CARRYING, LIKE, SIXTY POUNDS OF GEAR, RIGHT? SPEAKING OF WHICH, DO YOU HAVE EVERYTHING? YEAH. NIGHT-VISION CAMERAS, EMF DETECTORS, DIGITAL AUDIO, THE WORKS. IF THERE'S A GHOST OUT HERE, WE'LL FIND IT. WELL, THANK GOD SOMETHING WORKED OUT. ANYWAY, ACCORDING TO MY MAP... YOU'RE CLOSE TO A RAILROAD JUNCTION. JUST KEEP FOLLOWING THE LOGGING ROAD EAST UNTIL YOU COME ACROSS THE OLD RAILWAY TRACKS. AND THEN JUST STAY PUT UNTIL WE GET THERE, OKAY? AND IF YOU NEED TO CALL ME OR ANYONE ELSE... JUST USE YOUR WALKIE-TALKIE. CHANCES ARE HIGH YOUR PHONE WILL CUT OUT THE MINUTE YOU HIT THAT JUNCTION. WHAT ABOUT MEETING YOU AT THE FERRY DOCK? YOU PASSED IT. IT'S EASIER TO JUST GO ON AHEAD TO THE RAILROAD JUNCTION AND WE CAN MEET YOU THERE. GREAT, BECAUSE THE MINUTE WE ALL MEET UP, I'M MAKING ONE OF YOU GUYS CARRY THIS STUFF. IT'S HEAVY. NOBODY LIKES A WHINER. OH, YOU CAN GO TO- RUDE! I'VE WAITED LONG ENOUGH. MURPHY, IT'S WALT. YEAH, BEAR WITH ME, THERE'S NO CELL PHONE RECEPTION OUT HERE. YOU GOT THE COSTUME? ARE YOU KIDDDING ME? YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO LOOK LIKE A DEAD CHINESE RAILWAY WORKER FROM THE EIGHTEEN- HUNDREDS. HOW IS A BLACK CLOAK SUPPOSED TO... NEVER MIND, NEVER MIND. LOOK, YOU CAN WEAR THE CLOAK, JUST... IT HAS A HOOD, THOUGH, RIGHT? NO ONE CAN SEE YOUR FACE? 'WHY'? BECAUSE YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE A GHOST. YEAH, IT'S A PRACTICAL JOKE. THERE'S... THERE'S SIX OF US. WE ALL HAVE CAMERAS, AND SOUND RECORDERS, AND... NO. THERE'S NO REAL GHOST. IT'S JUST A BUNCH OF STORIES ABOUT GHOSTS HAUNTING THE OLD RAILROAD TRACKS. THEY PAY ME TO USE MY GEAR, WE GO TO CEMETERIES, OLD HOUSES, THAT KIND OF STUFF. NOTHING EVER ACTUALLY HAPPENS. I EXPLAINED THIS TO YOU ALL ALREADY LOOK, ALL I NEED YOU TO DO IS POP OUT IN A FEW SPOTS IN THE BACKGROUND AND IT'LL FREAK THEM OUT. I JUST WISHED YOU LOOKED A LITTLE MORE AUTHENTIC- LISTEN, YOU KNOW WHERE THE JUNCTION IS? THERE'S AN OLD ABANDONED RAILWAY HOUSE DOWN THAT WAY. EVERYBODY'S MEETING UP THERE. SO YOU CAN HIDE OUT THERE IF YOU WANT TO. ANYWAYS, IN A MINUTE OR TWO I'M ABOUT TO LOSE ALL MY RECEPTION, SO THIS WILL PROBABLY BE THE LAST CHANCE WE GET TO TALK. HEY! EMMA? HELLO!? HEY, WHERE ARE YOU RIGHT NOW? REALLY? LISTEN, I THINK I CAN HEAR YOU. CAN YOU WHISTLE OR SOMETHING? I THINK I CAN HEAR YOU. REAL FUNNY, MURPHY. MURPHY? HELLO? TERRIFIC. NO FREAKIN' SERVICE. THEY ARE NOT PAYING ME ENOUGH FOR THIS CRAP. FINALLY! MURPHY, I SWEAR TO GOD, IF YOU'RE MESSING WITH ME... UH, HELLO? IS ANYBODY OUT THERE? 'BREAKER BREAKER.' JEFF? IT'S SHELDON, WHERE ARE YOU? I JUST GOT TO THE OLD RAILWAY HOUSE, UH, WHERE ARE YOU? I'M STILL FOLLOWING THE TRACKS. THESE THINGS ONLY HAVE A RANGE OF ABOUT FIVE MILES OR SO. WE'RE ALL ON THE SAME BAND. SOMEBODY ELSE SHOULD HAVE PICKED UP BESIDES ME. SO WHERE ARE THEY? EMMA? WALT? CONRAD? ELI? GOOD QUESTION! EMMA'S SUPPOSED TO BE WAITING FOR EVERYONE ELSE TO SHOW UP DOWN AT THE DOCKS. AS FOR EVERYONE ELSE, YOUR GUESS IS AS GOOD AS MINE. HOPEFULLY THEY REMEMBER TO TURN THEIR WALKIE-TALKIES ON. DO WE EVEN KNOW IF WALT BROUGHT THE GEAR? ALL IF HAVE IS THIS EMF DETECTOR. YOU TRY TAKING ANY READINGS? YEAH. SO FAR NOTHING. WHAT ABOUT YOU? I JUST GOT HERE. ANYWAYS, WALT'S GOT ALL THE EQUIPMENT. IT'S PROBABLY BEST IF WE WAIT FOR EVERYONE ELSE TO SHOW UP AND WE CAN CONDUCT A FULL PARANORMAL INVESTIGATION. THIS PLACE REALLY IS OLD. NO ELECTRICITY, NO PLUMBING, NOTHING. WE MIGHT WANT TO CONSIDER WRAPPING THIS THING UP BEFORE DARK UNLESS YOU LIKE THE IDEA OF CAMPING OUT IN THE MIDDLE OF NOWHERE. COME ON, THAT'S THE WHOLE POINT! WHAT KIND OF GHOST INVESTIGATION DO YOU THINK WE'RE GOING TO HAVE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE DAY? THE KIND WHERE WE'LL HAVE HOT SHOWERS, AND WE'LL HAVE BEDS. WHAT'S THE BUILDING LIKE? OLD. HA-HA. NO, SERIOUSLY. OLD AND DESERTED. THIS PLACE WAS BUILT BACK IN THE EIGHTEEN -HUNDREDS. I DON'T EVEN KNOW IF THEY HAD ELECTRICITY AROUND THIS PLACE. SO WHAT THE HECK ARE WE DOING HERE? LOTS OF GHOST SIGHTINGS. HIKERS, SURVEYORS, FISHERMEN... ALL KEEP SEEING GHOSTS AROUND THE TRACK, AND ESPECIALLY AROUND THIS PLACE. WE'RE DEFINITELY STAYING THE NIGHT THEN, RIGHT? I MEAN, WE HAVE TO SPEND THE NIGHT IN A PLACE LIKE THAT. YEAH, ASSUMING EVERYONE CAN GET THEIR ACT TOGETHER AND MEETS UP HERE. I'M GOING TO DO A WALK-THROUGH AND WHEN YOU GET HERE JUST COME ON INSIDE, I COULD REALLY USE THE EMF DETECTOR. HOPEFULLY YOU GET BETTER RESULTS THAN I AM. THESE TRACKS ARE A BUST. SEE YOU SOON. THIS PLACE REALLY GIVES ME THE CREEPS. THIS IS DAY ONE OF OUR INVESTIGATION INTO THE TERMINUS COVE RAILWAY HOUSE, AND THE SURROUNDING AREA. MY NAME IS JEFF. THE TEAM LEADER. I'M THE FIRST TO ARRIVE ON LOCATION. WITH THIS RECORDING DEVICE I'LL BE DOING AUDIO TESTS FOR EVP OR 'ELECTRONIC VOICE PHENOMENON' UNTIL THE GROUP TECHNICIANS SHOW UP WITH THE REST OF THE GEAR. RIGHT NOW, I'M INSIDE WHAT SEEMS TO BE THE MAIN ROOM OF THE HOUSE. AND IF I REMEMBER CORRECTLY, THIS PLACE WAS BUILT IN EITHER 1858... ...OR '59, DURING THE CANADIAN PACIFIC RAILWAY CONSTRUCTION. IT WAS ORIGINALLY USED AS AN OFFICE, OR A MESS HALL, WHILE THE RAILWAY WAS BEING BUILT. LATER IT BECAME A CONDUCTOR'S OFFICE, THEN LIVING QUARTERS FOR THE RAILWAY'S SHIFT BOSS. ONCE THE RAILWAY WAS FINISHED... ...IT WAS ABANDONED... IN THE YEAR 209 B.C., OVER 8,000 LIFE-SIZED TERRACOTTA SOLDIERS WERE BURIED WITH THE FIRST EMPEROR OF CHINA. QIN SHI HUANG. IT IS BELIEVED THEY WERE PLACED THERE TO DEFEND THE EMPEROR IN THE AFTERLIFE. THERE ARE EVEN THOSE WHO BELIEVE THAT THEY WERE INTENDED TO BE THE VESSELS OF HIS UNDEAD ARMY, TO DO HIS BIDDING, FROM BEYOND THE GRAVE. SMALLER CLAY SOLDIERS, THOUGH EXTREMELY RARE, ARE SOMETIMES PLACED IN SPOTS OF GREAT TRAGEDY AND DEATH, SO THAT THE YUAN QUI - THE 'GHOST WITH GRIEVANCE' OF CHINESE FOLKLORE - MAY HAVE A CONDUIT TO RETURN TO THIS WORLD, AND HAVE THEIR GRIEVANCES REDRESSED. I'M NOW IN THE BASEMENT. IN THE WINTER OF 1860, THE WEATHER AND THE HARSH TERRAIN KILLED CLOSE TO A THOUSAND CHINESE IMMIGRANT WORKERS THEIR BODIES WERE BROUGHT HERE, WRAPPED IN SHEETS AND ALLEGEDLY BURIED IN UNMARKED GRAVES ALONG THE TRACKS. UNTIL THE GROUND THAWED, THIS PLACE WAS STACKED RIGHT TO THE CEILING. SUPPOSEDLY, SOME OF THEM WERE EVEN BROUGHT HERE WHEN THEY WERE STILL ALIVE. THERE MUST HAVE BE UNIMAGINABLE SUFFERING... IS ANYBODY OUT THERE? EMMA? WALT? ELI? BANDIT? BIG ENOS? ANYBODY? THE NEXT PLACE WE GO, BETTER HAVE DECENT CELL SERVICE... WALT? GREAT. NO CELL SERVICE. WALT! SING OUT IF YOU CAN HEAR ME! WALT! THE TRAIN'S LEAVING THE STATION! THAT'S WEIRD. CONARD?! HOW THE HELL ARE YOU CALLING ME? YEAH, IT'S A NEW INVENTION CALLED THE 'CELL PHONE'. I CAN BARELY HEAR YOU, THOUGH. YEAH, THAT'S BECAUSE THERE'S ALMOST NO SERVICE OUT HERE. DIDN'T ANYBODY PAY ATTENTION WHEN I HANDED OUT THE WALKIE-TALKIES? YEAH, I THOUGHT IT WAS WORTH A TRY TO CALL YOU. BUT ANYWAYS, I'M HERE AT THE FERRY DOCK RIGHT NOW WHERE YOU TOLD US TO MEET YOU, AND, U THERE'S NOBODY HERE. YOU'RE NOT HERE, NEITHER IS WALT, ELI, SHELDON OR JEFF. YEAH, I'M IN THE MIDDLE OF COMBING THE WOODS RIGHT NOW. I GUESS YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE WHO CAN FOLLOW INSTRUCTIONS. EVERYONE ELSE IS WANDERING AROUND LIKE A BUNCH OF LOST SHEEP, APPARENTLY. DO YOU THINK THEY WENT AHEAD TO THE OLD RAILWAY HOUSE? I HAVE NO IDEA. BUT I'LL END UP THERE MYSELF SOONER OR LATER. TRY YOUR WALKIE-TALKIE? I WOULD DO IT MYSELF, BUT I'VE ALREADY BEEN TRYING TO GET AHOLD OF EVERYONE FOR THE LAST COUPLE OF HOURS AND I THINK MY BATTERIES ARE DEAD. WALT SHOULD BE AT THE HOUSE BY NOW AT ANY RATE, I TOLD HIM TO GO ON AHEAD. HOPEFULLY HE'S SETTING UP FOR THE INVESTIGATION. YEAH, I'LL TRY THAT. BUT IF I CAN'T GET HIM ON THE WALKIE-TALKIES, I'LL GO AHEAD AND GO OUT TO THE HOUSE MYSELF. TALK TO YOU SOON I'M GOING TO CONDUCT AN EVP AUDIO TEST NOW. I'M SPEAKING TO THE SPIRITS OF ANYONE THAT MIGHT BE RESIDING IN THIS ROOM. THIS IS A RECORDER. IT CAN PICK UP SOUNDS THAT I CAN'T. SO IF YOU HAVE ANYTHING TO SAY TO THE WORLD OF THE LIVING, NOW IS YOUR CHANCE. I'M TRYING TO COMMUNICATE WITH YOU! IF YOU HAVE ANYTHING TO SAY TO THE WORLD OF THE- THIS IS CONRAD. WHERE'S EVERYONE? CONRAD! HOLY CRAP, BUD. JEFF? ARE YOU OKAY? YEAH, I'M FINE. YOU JUST STARTLED ME! I WAS DOING AN AUDIO SESSION DOWN HERE IN THE BASEMENT. ARE YOU AT THE OLD RAILWAY HOUSE? YEAH, I'VE BEEN HERE FOR A WHILE NOW. SO FAR NOBODY ELSE HAS SHOWN UP. WELL, YEAH, I MANAGED TO GET AHOLD OF EMMA EARLIER, BUT, UH I FEEL LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE IS LOST, OR SOMETHING. OR THEIR WALKIE-TALKIES ARE OFF. EITHER WAY, THIS INVESTIGATION'S OFF TO A SHAKY START. THIS WHOLE IDEA WAS EMMA'S, SO YOU CAN BLAME HER. SHE'S IN CHARGE, DUDE. SHE SAID THAT THE BATTERIES IN HER WALKIE-TALKIER WERE DEAD, SO, GOOD LUCK TRYING TO GET AHOLD OF HER. BUT, HER CELL PHONE'S ON. SHE KNOWS THE WAY. SHE'LL GET HERE BEFORE LONG. YEAH, I'M JUST ON MY WAY TO FIND THE RAILWAY TRACKS. SHOULDN'T BE TOO LONG TO GET THERE. SOUNDS GOOD TO ME. AND IF YOU HAPPEN RUN INTO ANYONE ELSE ALONG THE WAY... YEAH, YEAH, I KNOW. I'LL, UH, I'LL MAKE SURE THAT THEY COME WITH ME. I'LL SEE YOU SOON. SHOULD HAVE STAYED IN WINNIPEG. PLEASE TELL ME SOMEBODY ELSE SHOWS UP. THIS IS JEFF. IS THERE ANYBODY ELSE OUT THERE? CONRAD? WALT? ELI? EMMA! EMMA, ARE YOU OUT THERE? I'M HAVING A REAL HARD TIME GETTING IN CONTACT WITH ANYBODY. SHELDON? IS ANYBODY OUT THERE? EMMA?! JEFF? THANK GOD! I CAN'T FIND ANYBODY. CAN BARELY HEAR YOU! THE BATTERIES ARE ALMOST OUT ON THIS THING. ANYWAY YOU COULD MAYBE SWITCH OVER TO YOUR CELL PHONE? NO RECEPTION. ARE YOU AT THE RAILWAY HOUSE? I WAS! THOUGHT I HEARD YOU ON THE WALKIE-TALKIE SO I CAM OUT HERE TO THE TRACKS TO SEE IF I COULD PICK YOU UP ANY BETTER. I'M IN THE WOODS RIGHT NOW. I'VE BEEN TRYING TO ROUND UP THE GANG. THIS INVESTIGATION'S NOT GOING SO WELL. THAT'S AN UNDERSTATEMENT! LOOK, I'M GONNA GIVE IT A FEW MORE MINUTES, THEN I'M GOING TO HEAD TO THE HOUSE MYSELF. I NEED YOU THERE IN CASE ANYBODY ELSE SHOWS UP. AND IF- EMMA?! EMMA! I DIDN'T CATCH THAT LAST PART. PLEASE TELL ME SOMEBODY ELSE SHOWED UP. THIS IS JEFF. IS THERE ANYBODY ELSE OUT THERE? JEFF? JEFF, IT'S ELI. FINALLY! YOU, UH, SOUND A LITTLE FRAZZLED THERE, PAL. WELL SO FAR, EVERYBODY ELSE IS A NO-SHOW. WELL DON'T BLAME ME, I JUST GOT HERE MYSELF. TO BE HONEST, I'M STARTING TO GET A LITTLE BIT WORRIED. WELL EVERYONE'S GOT MAPS AND WALKIE-TALKIES. SO JUST CHILL OUT. I FOUND WALT'S EMF DETECTOR BY THE RAILWAY. PROBABLY FELL OUT OF HIS POCKET. HE'D LOSE HIS CAR KEYS BEFORE HE LOST THAT THING. SERIOUSLY, YOU KNOW HOW THOSE GUYS ARE. WALT, SHELDON, CONRAD. THEY'RE FINE ON THEIR OWN BUT ONCE THEY GET TOGETHER, IT TURNS INTO AN ALL-NIGHT KEGGER. WELL, IF THEY'RE OUT IN THE WOODS PARTYING, I'LL PUT A STOP TO IT. JUST HAVE THEM CHECK IN WITH ME. OR EMMA. OF COURSE. BETTER YET, JUST SEND THEM TOWARDS THE RAILWAY HOUSE. LAST THING I NEED IS FOR EVERYONE TO GO MISSING! OVER AND OUT. ELI! EMMA! THIS IS AN EMERGENCY! THIS IS AN EMERGENCY! GHOST SIGHTING BY THE RAILWAY HOUSE! DEFINITELY A GHOST SIGHTING. HEY JEFF, EMMA, YOU GUYS! JEFF! ELI! LISTEN CLOSELY. MY NAME IS MURPHY, I'M A FRIEND OF WALT'S. HE PAID ME A HUNDRED DOLLARS TO COME OUT HERE AND SCARE YOU GUYS DRESSED AS A GHOST. IT WAS A PRANK. WHAT HAPPENED TO ELI? I DON'T... I DON'T KNOW. HE WAS ATTACKED. I THINK HE'S DEAD. I'VE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE IT BEFORE. THE ONLY REASON IT DIDN'T GET ME WAS BECAUSE I HID. 'IT'?! I THINK IT WAS A GHOST. IT WAS DRESSED IN THIS CRAZY OUTFIT, REAL BIG, REAL SCARY. TRY TO STAY CALM. I JUST WANT TO GET OUT OF HERE. STAY PUT. I'LL COME FIND YOU. I CAN'T. I HAVE TO GET OUT OF HERE! LOOK OUT! JEFF. EMMA! WHAT'S GOING ON? WE NEED TO GET OUT OF HERE. WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? THERE'S SOMETHING OUTSIDE! NOW WHAT WAS THAT? NO TIME TO EXPLAIN. WE HAVE TO GO! DAMN! WE CAN HIDE OUT IN THE BASEMENT. COME ON! I DON'T KNOW HOW LONG THAT'LL HOLD HIM. IN THE END, IT WON'T MATTER. WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? I BROUGHT YOU ALL HERE FOR A REASON. IT WAS THE WORKERS. THE ONES THAT WERE LAID TO REST HERE IN THE BASEMENT. THEY CALLED TO ME. TOLD ME TO BRING YOU HERE. YUAN GUI. DO YOU KNOW THAT TERM? IT'S CHINESE FOR 'GHOST WITH GRIEVANCE'. THEY WANDER THE EARTH, UNABLE TO BE REINCARNATED, UNABLE TO LEAVE HERE. UNTIL THEY GET THEIR VENGEANCE. THAT THING, UPSTAIRS, IS THEIR VENGEANCE. THEY WERE IGNORED, FORGOTTEN IN LIFE. THEY WILL NOT REST, UNTIL A LIFE IS TAKEN FOR EVERY LIFE LOST TO THESE RAILROADS. YOUR FRIENDS ARE DEAD. NO. I'LL BE DEAD, AND SO WILL YOU. AND SO WILL MANY, MANY OTHERS. WHAT ARE YOU DOING? RESTORING THE BALANCE. IT IS SAID, THAT THOUSANDS OF CHINESE WORKERS NEEDLESSLY DIED DURING THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE RAILWAY. THAT MAYBE, JUST MAYBE, THEIR WANDERING SPIRITS ARE CALLING OUT TO THE LIVING, DEMANDING TO BE HEARD. A LIFE FOR A LIFE. UNTIL THEY CAN ALL MOVE ON TO THE NEXT WORLD IN PEACE. MAYBE YOU CAN HEAR THEM CALLING YOU NOW.
