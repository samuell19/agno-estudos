YOUNG HEROES (aka LITTLE HEROES) ("Zi Gu Ying Xiong Chu Shao Nian") WANTED. REWARD. DEATH TO ALL WHO HIDE HIM. At home we depend on our parents. Now, brothers, we are at Guilong dock. Those with money, use it to help others. Those without money, be helpful in other ways. My brothers and elders, many thanks! Many thanks! Go, go, go, go. They've arrived! - Bring me a cup of tea. - Coming! - Where are you going? - Homeward. - "Where does the ship come from?" - "The Number One Spring under the Heaven." - "How many springs are there?" - "72 upstream, 36 downstream." "Altogether there are 108 springs." - "Heaven and earth." - "A unison of hearts." Master Hu, you've finally arrived! Chief Zhang, what's the situation at the dock? Everything's fine. But the city gates are closely guarded by Qing soldiers. That's quite usual. Nothing surprising. What about the wives and children of our dead comrades? 18 of our comrades died when our headquarters was destroyed. They left behind 20 orphans. We've taken care of them. They're all safe. They're all here. What about the Lord's son? Ermao? Rest assured, I've sent Master Li and some comrades to protect him. They're waiting inside the city now for the order. I think we'd better act fast. I agree! Let's get the children on board quickly! Hoist the sails! What do coloured sails mean? It means they're ... protecting someone. Want to go on board and have some fun? The fish are too small anyway. The ship's setting sail. The ship's setting sail! Quick. Go. Get your fortune told here. They're leaving. I'm hungry! Hurry and get on board the ship! Get on board! Hurry up! Come on! Hurry up. Hurry. They've boarded! Their disguises are so good. Come on, let's go! What are you worried about? If it was dangerous, then the coloured sails wouldn't have been hoisted. The Qing soldiers have already blocked the city gates. We must go before it's too late. - Are the Qing soldiers guarding the dock as well? - Yes. l've got a really bad feeling today. Look, there are so many strangers... - Go tell Master Zhang! - It's already too late. All we can do is ask Buddha to protect the children on board. Hurry. But ... Ermao still hasn't boarded. I'll go and find Ermao. Hurry! Get on the ship! Here. Hurry up. Follow them. Let us pass. Excuse me. Look at those two fishermen! - What about them? - That guy's eating a live fish! He's Sima Li! Qing soldiers. Go to the city entrance. Hold it! - Who is it? - My master's son is ill. Let me have a look. But it's the big boss's son. It's been getting worse for half a year. - Get out of here! - Forgive me... sorry. Close the gate! Hurry! Find Ermao and arrest him! Come on. Fight. Master, all the peddlers here are our own people. Take this. - Master Li! - Now where can you run? - Master Li! I've caught Ermao! The 5,200 tael reward is mine! Look! The real Ermao is here! What?! Hold it! Let me see who the real one is. Take a good look. Hurry! I'll take care of it. Quick! Look, old woman, there are three people dead already. And the ship still hasn't cast off. The ship can't get away. Are you going to try to fly? Master, catch! l'll cut the rope! - Set sail! - Grandpa Hu! Grandpa Hu! Grandpa! Grandpa! Open up. Quick! Quick! - Get inside! Big Man, what happened? I couldn't help it! My wife is keeping a close watch on me. - I finally managed to sneak out. - It's always such a drama with you! Now what about the actual problem? Iron Tiger might be a spy. Iron Tiger, that dog! I'll kill him and avenge my father's death. Iron Tiger is loyal and righteous. I don't believe he would do such a thing. - Open up! Open up! - Dammit. The wife's after me again! - Quick! Let's go. - Yes. Hey, who are you looking for? Hold on... Uhh... Traitor, you're no longer one of us! ls Iron Tiger your partner? Speak up! Iron Tiger ... he... he - Nanny! Nanny! - Qing troops may be in the front yard. - In the front yard? Go! Quick. Quick! - Nanny... - Tell everyone to leave now! Erga, tell everyone to leave quickly. - Go! - Go in to have a look! - Aren't you looking for that boy? - The fellow with the red bandanna may know. Follow him! - Who is he? - The master of Tiger Hall - lron Tiger. Iron Tiger! Quick, quick. Chase them! They won't catch us if we take this small path. Keep going. Come on. Go. Look! Let's go down. Come on. Stop. Over there. Nanny, don't overdo it. Let's go. Several of our comrades died, but we still weren't able to cast off. The Qing soldiers fought their way onto the ship. Fortunately, Jiang in one leap hurled herself onto the pier, and severed the rope with her sword. The children on board were saved. But what happened to Jiang? She fell into the river and was swept away. Nanny, I'm a good guy, too. Will you let me stay? Huh? You want to join? With your kung fu? Now, now. You'd better go home. Your parents will be worrying about you. And your wife, too. Never! I'd rather face a tiger than see her! Big Brother, please help me. Tiandihui brothers have sworn to overthrow the Qing dynasty. We're not afraid to die. Yet you're afraid of your wife! Little Brother Ermao. What?! Who said you could call me that? - Yes, yes! Big Brother Ermao! - What's the matter? - Your father is the leader of the Tiandihui. - Yes. What of it? I... you... Can you... Oh, you want us to become sworn brothers, so you can join the Tiandihui. Right! Help me join! No way. Okay, okay. That's enough. We'll be at Li's family lodge tomorrow. The stronghold is one of our branches. Sima Li, that son of a bitch. He won't catch up with us. Neither will Iron Tiger. - Nor my wife! - All right. When we get to Li's family lodge, I'll arrange someone to take you home. Come on. This is Li's family lodge. Slow down. Nanny, look! Nanny. Jiang! Old fool, if you want to see your grand- daughter again, then bring Ermao here. Don't do it, Nanny! Get out of here! Quick. Go! - Nanny, let me go in her place. - You can't go. You'll just die even faster. There's no hurry. Just take your time to think about it. You old fool, the people of this lodge won't come to save you. After we got here, there's no one left any more! Nanny, what should we do? You're all expert fighters, yet you resort to such dirty methods! Have you reached a decision? Nanny, just let me go. What do you think? Nanny, don't fall for it! Don't move. Old woman, surely you don't like to see your granddaughter in this position? She is suffering. Hurry and give us Ermao for her! Come over here. Listen! If you ever want to see your granddaughter again, you'd better bring Ermao before I count to ten. One, two, three, four, five... six, seven, eight... Nine! Fight! Ermao, you can't run away! Jiang, this should help! My name is Big Man. I want to join the Tiandihui. Please introduce me, okay? Screw you. Jiang, you're a much better fighter than Ermao. You're much nicer than him, and not as ugly, either. Big Man! You insulted me! I'll tell my father not to let you join! Brother Ermao, I didn't mean you! Run! Little bastard, where are you running? I... I... I don't belong to the Tiandihui. No? I just overhead you begging the girl to introduce you! It hasn't been confirmed yet, so it doesn't count. - It counts! - It doesn't count! It counts because I said so! Where are all these cute girls coming from? He hit me! That's right, little boy, complain to your mother. - Mother?? She's my wife. - That's enough. This fine tigress is your wife? You can kill a man, but don't ever insult him! Very good! Very good! Tiger fist? A real man doesn't fight women. My wife is great! - Who are you two? - I'm Little Leopard! - I'm Big Leopard! - Where's Nanny? - Over there somewhere. Go! Over there! - Nanny! - You traitor! Nanny! Run! Over there. Go! Nanny! Nanny! Nanny, are you all right? Quick, take Nanny away. Attack! Master, are you all right? - Everything ok? - Go! Get off. Nanny. - Nanny, are you all right? - My knee is hurt. Let's go. Iron Tiger. Catch! Hey, don't leave me! Don't you want me? Come back! Women these days! They're really something else! Hey, catch! Hey, don't leave like that! Wait for me! Run! Get over there! Look! Ermao! Catch Ermao! Get him! Nanny, let's go. Be careful, Nanny. - Quick. Go, Nanny! - You lot go first. Nanny... Go across the plain and go to Hu's family lodge. Nanny... The Tiandihui is now counting on all of you. Nanny.... Don't go just yet. Go, quickly! Qing generals won't even spare a few small children. If we don't catch these little bastards... then how can the Tiandihui be truly subjugated? - Run away, quickly! - Nanny.... Hurry! Go! - Children, hurry away! - Come on! - Nanny! - Nanny! - Nanny! - Nanny! Nanny... Nanny! Don't worry, this is a short cut. We'll catch up with them once we cross this mountain. Iron Tiger, where's the road? There used to be a road here... I'll find it. - What happened to it? - Are you putting me on? - I didn't ask you to come. - Why are you here then? I'm in the Tiandihui. My orders are to escort the children. You're the bodyguard?? Then why do the children run away when they see you? Oh, don't worry about that. My original order was stolen, and switched with a false one. - You don't doubt me, right? - Doubt? I'm sure you're the court's lap dog! You wretch, you've really gone too far. If it weren't for the Tiandihui's rule not to hurt women, I'd.. You still think you're a Tiandihui member? You deliberately led me here so that your partners can kill the children. There used to be a road! Why do you keep following me? You're not my wife. No wonder Big Man wants to run away from home. Run! That boy is my friend. Look, over there! Over there, chase them! Quick, run! Try to keep up! Get on the horse! Over there, get him! Giddyup. Giddyup. Ada, what happened? Ada, what happened? Hurry, faster. Quick, come on. What's the matter? Living Buddha, down the mountain some bad guys are chasing some children. Please hurry and help them. Really? Tashi, Gata, Nyima, Agupung. Take the herd with you. Go and save those children, and bring them back. Yes. Yes. Look. It's a herd of yaks. Quick - move! Giddyup! Faster! Living Buddha. Thank you for saving our lives. Pray to merciful Buddha. - Big Man, your turn! - I can't! Come on, Big Man, do it. My kung fu isn't good enough. Wait. Little one, I'll play with you. Come. Come. Come on. Goodbye! Goodbye! Goodbye! Goodbye! Goodbye! Merciful Buddha. Come on, come on! Hurry up! Big Man, come on. Hurry up. All right, all right. It's cooked! It's ready. - Pass one to me. - Delicious. - It's ready to eat. - Oh, it's hot. - Give me one! - No. Eat quickly, we still have a long way to go. We can't kill Sima Li if we don't get to Hu's family lodge in time. And we won't be able to avenge Nanny. There are so many roads. Who knows which way to go? I said we should take the main road, but no one's listening. The main road's dangerous. We should take the side roads. Stick to the main road! - Side roads! - The main road! - All right, all right. Knock it off. We'll choose a leader, then the leader can decide. - Great. I vote for Little Leopard. - I choose Big Leopard. - I'll vote for Jiang. Her kung fu's the best. - Little Leopard's kung fu's the best! - Jiang's the best! - Little Leopard's the best! We'll fight it out. Whoever wins is the leader. All right. Let's fight. I agree. A duel? No problem! Come on. Catch! Jiang! Forget it, you guys can't beat Jiang. Let Jiang be the leader. Master. This is the road they must follow. We'll hide in the mill. All right. You... Looks good on you. You were injured when you fell into the river, so how did you survive and make it to Li's family lodge? After I fell in the river, Master Li sailed downstream and rescued me. Then he took me to his lodge to recuperate. Li's family lodge is such a fortified stronghold. How was it defeated? - It's all because of that traitor Huang Zhong. - Him again? He killed my father. Little Leopard, I'll find Huang Zhong, and avenge your father. Huang Zhong has already been killed by Nanny. But he has an accomplice. I'll kill him! - Who? - lron Tiger. Hurry. - Hey Jiang, let's have some tea. - Don't disturb the people here. - We'll rest over there. - Yes, ma'am! - What are you doing? - Nothing. Ermao, look! He's peeing! What?? Peeing? Goddamn it. Still not coming in! I'll go out and kill them! It's no use killing them! They're worth 5,200 taels captured alive. - Shut up. - Yes. You two, go and lure them here. - Yes. - Yes. Hey, children. Come and have some tea. The villagers have brought us tea! Thank you! Show your thanks to them. Thanks a lot, thanks a lot. Thanks a lot. Come on, help yourself. - Thank you. - Thank you. Thanks a lot. - Thank you. - Thank you. - Run! - Get him alive! What have you grabbed this one for? This child isn't worth anything, you idiot. Go to hell! I'm also a Tiandihui member! If you don't believe me, ask him! I'm up here! - Ask away. - It's that guy again. - Run! - Come on! I belong to the Tiandihui, too! I'm also worth 5,200 taels! - You're always looking down on me! - Go! Let me take care of him. The mantis stalks the cicada, unaware of the oriole behind. - This little lady's fallen into my trap. - Of course, of course! - Master Sima's plan is brilliant! - Stop licking his arse! Go! We're going to freeze to death before we even reach Hu's family lodge. This is the fastest route. We'll be in Hu's family lodge once we get over this mountain. Climbing this mountain has destroyed my shoes. Now I'm barefoot! If we don't go this way, your shoes might be ok, but you will be destroyed! - Huh. You talk too much. - Really? Am I not right? If you're so great, go by yourself. Don't stick with us. Stop arguing. Big Man, go and get some firewood. Yes, I have no time to chat. I must gather firewood. Hold it. Just wait a moment. I have an idea. Where do you think you're running to? Jiang! Ermao! Help, save me! Hurry. Stop! Forget it. Don't fight. We shouldn't obstruct a wife looking for her husband. Let's go. Take care, Big Man. I told you we shouldn't have come this way. Look how spooky it is. And Big Man wouldn't have been captured. We're almost there. What's the big deal? Ermao! - Hurry up. - Yes. - Hurry! - Go! Go! Faster! - Move! - What are you doing? Faster! What are you doing? Are you crazy? What do you know?! Tiandihui are good people! What's good about them? They're finished. Women are so shortsighted. Their kung-fu is good, they're good people, and they looked after me well. - It's you who's no good! - What can you possibly do for them? At least I'd try! You have no sense of loyalty and friendship. Iron Tiger! Ermao and the others have been captured. They're being held in Shijing Temple. - Go and rescue them at once. - Yes. - Okay, let's go. - Eight, eight! - One more! - Six, six, six! - Three peach orchards. - Five big ones! - Seven! - Six, six, six! - Seven! - Nine, nine! - Eight, eight! - Loser has to drink! Yeah... drink, drink! Drink! These guys are really having fun. Brother, you drink first. I'll go for a walk. I'll make sure the children don't escape, okay? Lao Wu, you're too nervous for someone of your position. They're all tied up in the temple hall. How could those idiot children possibly get away? It's my fault for choosing this road... and getting you all captured. What's done is done. Too late to change it now. What's the use regretting it now? If we'd listened to Iron Tiger, and followed him... things might be better. Iron Tiger? Traitor! To me... Iron Tiger doesn't look like a traitor. You're too cautious. The rebels have already been crushed. There are no rebels left within a five hundred mile radius. If the rebel headquarters hadn't been destroyed, we wouldn't even have a place to drink and sleep tonight. Yes! We've been chasing these scoundrels for a thousand miles. - Let's just relax and get drunk. - Yes. These children ... are each worth 5,200 taels! The reward is trivial. Ermao is the son of the Tiandihui leader. Well get him this time. We'll use the children to cut off the head of the snake. This is our trump card. Don't take this lightly. Great idea, Big Brother. Thank you for finding so many people to rescue them. Then from now on, you must do what you're told. Certainly, my good wife. He really can't hold his drink! Big Brother, good job. Come on, Big Brother. Is that all you've got? Stop! He's so weak! Trouble-maker. Pretending to be a ghost to scare us. Puny bastard. Big Brother! Big Brother! Ermao has escaped! Get away! Forget it. We're leaving. Don't worry. Big Man's wife is still there. - Big Man? We should help him. - No need. It won't be a problem. Iron Tiger will be here with reinforcements before dawn. Let's go. Get a move on! - Iron Tiger's here! - Traitor! It's just a misunderstanding. He's the master of Tiger Hall. - Jiang. - Big Man's wife is inside. What? Let's go and get her! Don't move. You lot wait here. Come on!
