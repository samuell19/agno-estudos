[Storm raging] [♪♪♪] [♪♪♪] [♪♪♪] [Bike bell ringing] [Man]: Okay, I'll see you guys at the diner, in 20 minutes. Thanks, buddy! [Man speaks, indistinct] I'm going to call you back. Dad? Hey, honey. [Fumes quietly] Excuse me? Hello? Yeah? Okay, dad is sitting on top of the boat, reading the newspaper again. You want m-- can you please do something about it? Do you know how embarrassing that is? What's embarrassing? Oh, forget it. [♪♪♪] I'm embarrassing Christy again? Welcome to the club. See you guys in a bit. [♪♪♪] [Quiet chatter] Hey, guys. So, what'd you want to talk about? The deal is dead. What do you mean, the deal is dead? The deal no longer exists. National booksellers was bought out by a Japanese conglomerate. So they're not taking my book? That's right, Robert. They're not taking your book. I told you we should've never let him talk us into his stupid book idea. Two weeks on the shelf, not a single sale. What, are you saying this is my fault? Yes, I'm saying it's your fault. They were never serious, Robert. Their interest was only superficial. Well, how the hell was I supposed to know they being less than honest? Well, maybe if you took your head out of y-- all right, all right, all right-- everyone, just calm down. We're closing the store. When? Today! Soon. Probably a couple of weeks. We're filing for bankruptcy. You're overreacting. No, it's done, the papers have been signed. Well, what about your customers? What about this town? You guys have been here forever! Don't you mean what about your book? I mean, it's okay, Robert, you can keep the advance, if that's what you're concerned about. [Scoffs in disgust] Robert... [Calls out]: He didn't mean it-- Robert? Robert, wait! Robert! Look, I'm sorry about Louis's temper. You know he's overreacting. I know... But we're in trouble. I mean, we can save the publishing end. Got a good roster of titles... Hey, maybe your little book will catch fire and will save our bacon. All right. I'll, um... I'll-- I'll keep you up to date. [Sighs] [♪♪♪] I don't know what to do anymore, mom. You just have to give her time. Christy was only eight years old when her mother passed away, she's had her dad to herself ever since. You represent a great big change, honey, on a lot of different levels. Yeah, I know... But her mom passed away six years ago. Okay? We've been married for two years. She's a teenager. Yeah. Hey, you never told me. Did you get the results of that pregnancy test? I just got the phone call. There was a false positive. So I guess you're going to have to wait a little while before you're a grandmother. Aw, honey, I'm so sorry. Yeah, I thought for sure that I was pregnant this time. Mom, I'm starting to get scared that there's something wrong with me. Of course there isn't. You put too much weight on yourself, honey. [♪♪♪] I love these afternoon chats, mom. Yeah, me too. [♪♪♪] [Sighs] [Truck door opens] Oh. There's Robert. You know what? I'm going to go and let you guys, you know. Hey, Hannah. Bye, hon. Hey, Hannah. Hi, Robert. Hey. Mm. You leaving? Yeah, so much to do, so little time. Yeah. See you. Okay. Bye. Hi, buddy. There you go. The national deal fell through. What? Justin and Louis are going to close the store and declare bankruptcy. Louis is pissed, he blames me. Well, that's not fair. Nah, I walked out. Hey, baby, I'm sorry. You know... We've got a baby on the way, I can always go back to teaching. Aw, honey, I'm sorry. Me too. [♪♪♪] [Drops fork] I can just eat later. And what is this stuff, anyway? It's aloo gobi, it's east Indian. You've had that before. I don't see why I have to be here. You have to be here because we're a family, and families eat together. I don't see how it's a big deal. I don't think your dad means for it to be a big deal. [Sets fork down] I've got an idea. You've got a few days off school, I got some time on my hands, there's plenty of gas in the boat... What do you say we go cruising around bear island? All three of us? Yeah. All three of us. We'll camp out for a few days, we'll turn around, we'll come back. It'll be fun. I think it sounds like a good idea. Yeah! I'll get my mom to take care of Cody. Fantastic. Well, Cody is lucky. [Cody grumbles] [♪♪♪] Hey, where's Christy? She should really be up here, enjoying this cruise. I seriously don't understand why I have to be here. Adults are like that. They drive me crazy. Yeah, well, step-parents are the worst. Honestly, she's all, like, friendly and know-it-all. I mean, give me a break. When my phone runs out of minutes, I don't know what I'll do. Buy some more minutes. [Thickly]: Yeah, 'cause there's a store on bear island, where I can buy minutes. [Mother]: Star! Off the phone! Do homework! [Sighs wearily]: I gotta go. The adults are complaining again. Look, my advice to you is this-- just because they forced you to go doesn't mean you have to enjoy yourself. That's true. - Bye. - Star! I'm coming! [♪♪♪] Look at that. That is a green algae called pyrocystis lunula, and it glows when it's agitated. At least I know what "agitated" means. [Teresa]: Look at that! A timberland wolf! Wow, I wonder what spooked him. I'm only mildly interested. Maybe it was a cougar? Maybe it was a bear. It's "bear island." Kiddo, you are gonna love bear island. Me and your grandfather used to camp there all the ti-- dad. I've heard that a thousand times. Hey, did you guys see the-- [sarcastically]: Wow. Is there anything you don't know? Hey! Who are you? And what have you done with my daughter? Hey! Where are you goin'? Just... [Cabin door shuts] ...just let her be for a while. So what was it that you and your dad used to do? [Chuckles dismissively] Oh, do you know what I found... When I was tidying up down below? This. What's this? It's my lucky charm... When I was a kid. Aww! That's sweet. [♪♪♪] [Robert]: I'm going to start going around bear island. Hey... I just heard a report on the radio. There's a storm system headed this way. Can we outrun it? No, not a chance. We'll be caught in the middle. It shouldn't be too bad, though. They say it's a small system. We should, uh, stay close to shore, just to be safe. But be careful of the rocks. All right. Aye-aye, cap'n. [Thunder crashes] [Fierce winds roaring as thunder rumbles] [♪♪♪] - Oh! - God! Can't you steer from inside? No, I can't see anything from in there. Well, they should fire whoever said this would be a small system! Ah! How's Christy doin'? She's seasick. She needs to see you. I got my hands full right now, honey. I can handle this, you go downstairs. All right, just keep us in the middle of the channel. All right? We should be okay. [♪♪♪] Daddy! It's okay. [Sobbing]: Dad, I'm scared, I want to go home! I know, baby, but there's nothing we can do about it now. We've just got to hold on. Hang on. [Thunder crashing] [Glass imploding and Christy shrieks] [Electricity zapping] [♪♪♪] Don't move! Teresa! This is an emergency! Anybody copy? [♪♪♪] [Yelps]: Dad! Dad! [Thunder claps] Hey! [Christy pleading] [Grunts as hull crashes] Whoa! [Scraping intensely] [Waster blasting] [Gasps] [Panicking] Dad! Dad! [Groans weakly as thunder claps and roars] [Screaming and sobbing]: Dad! Dad! Dad! [Fearful sobbing] Where's your dad? I don't know! I don't know, he just disappeared! What? Robert! Robert! Robert! Dad! Dad! Where'd he go? Dad! Robert! Robert! Robert! [Christy sobbing as Teresa continues calling] [Winds screaming] There he is! Dad! [Cries] Come on, let's go, we got to get off the boat! [Christy]: No! Christy, we have to get off the boat right now! [Christy crying and protesting] [Storm raging] [Both gasping and grunting] [Panicking]: Dad? Dad! Dad! Dad! [Teresa grunts] Christy! I need your help! I need your help. [Women grunting] [Thunder roars] [Christy yelps] What are you doing? I'm getting supplies off the boat! Hypothermia will set in in three hours! [Christy sobbing] [♪♪♪] [♪♪♪] Dear god, please protect us from this storm. God, please save my dad. I'm scared. [Sobbing softly] [♪♪♪] [Seagulls crying] [Flames crackling] Christy, honey? Do you have your phone? I need to have your phone. Honey? Hey. Do you have your phone? [Gulls crying] Great. I'm sorry. Are you okay? [Shivering quietly] What are you doing? I'm going to dry the phones out and hope that we can use them later. [Sighs wearily] [Sighing] [Seagulls crying] [Sniffles deeply] [Sighs resolutely] [To self]: Okay. First rule of survival-- [sniffs] ...don't panic. Stop and think. [Seagulls' crying persists] [Sighs] [Exhales heavily] [♪♪♪] Christy? You all right? Yeah, I'm fine. Does anybody know we're out here? No. Can we try the phones now? Yeah. Nothing. [Flips phone shut] [Phone claps shut] Last chance. [Phone chimes] We have power! [Begins dialing] [Line starts ringing] It's ringing! [Ringing crackles] [Cell ringing] Christy? Hi, Christy, is that you? [Crackling]: Christy? Mom! Mom, it's Teresa. [Loud static crackling] Mom! [Redialing] [Line beeping] Did she hear you? [Dials] [Ringing] [Voicemail]: Hey! It's Christy. Leave a message. [Beeping] Hi, Christy. It's Hannah. I couldn't hear you. Call me back, okay? I don't know. But if she did, she'll get help. All right, we need a plan. Let's see how your dad's doing. [Engine overhead] [Christy]: Plane! I hope they see this. [Flare blasts and screams] [♪♪♪] I don't think they saw the flare. They'll come back, right? Somebody will. [Rumbling] [Plane continues overhead] Come on, you lazy bones! Get it while it's hot! [Bacon sizzling] [Sing-song]: ♪ smell that bacon... Mm, mm! Come on! Breakfast won't eat itself-- [roaring] [Gasps]: Oh... whoa! Whoa, now. [Growling] Okay... okay... [Growling] Okay... I know, you just want some bacon. [Roaring viciously] Ho, now... [Growling] Get back in the tent now! Shh! It's okay... [Grumbling] Just... [Roars] [Bear growling] [Roaring] [Yelps] [Roars louder] [Whimpering and sobbing] [Grizzly roaring] [Woman shrieking] [Panicking]: I need help! [Deafening roar] [Silence falls] Okay, baby... Drink that up. [Gulps] [Spoon clatters against cup] Mm. [Groans softly] Thanks, baby. Christy, are you okay? I'm okay. How's your head? Mm... it's killing me. You two are both okay, though, right? Mm-hmm. Good. How's your leg? Do you think you can move? Nah... It's bad, I think it might be broken. [Robert sighs wearily] [Robert bristles] [Exhales tensely] [Groans softly] Is he going to be all right? Yeah, honey. Well, what are we going to do? We have to do something. We have to help him. You're smart, you know everything! Oh, honey, I don't know everything. But I do know that your daddy's going to be okay. Now, we have to get on that boat. Let's go. What are you looking for? We need that raft. [Water sloshing] [Muffled splashing] [♪♪♪] Teresa? [Splashing ceases] Teresa? Teresa, are you okay? Teresa! Can you answer me? Teresa? I'm okay. [Sighs softly] Okay. I'm fine. Now, if I can find that pack. [♪♪♪] We got it. Oh... [Grunts] What are we going to do now? We're going to stay safe... And then, in a few days, if we have to, we can take this raft. I guess dad got his wish. What's that? A family eating meals together. [♪♪♪] [Sighs] [Speed dials] [Line ringing] Hi! This is Teresa, and I'll get back to you as soon as I can. Have a great day. Honey, it's mom. Call me when you get this message, okay? [Beep] [Speed dials again] [Line ringing] Hi. This is Bob Childs. I can't take your call-- [beep] [Cody whimpers] Something's wrong. I can feel it. [♪♪♪] Your infection's getting worse. We have to go for help. Okay. You hanging in there, kiddo? Well, after everything she's been through, she's doing great. You know this isn't exactly what I had in mind when I suggested we go camping, right? [Laughs] That's okay, dad. [Robert sighs] [♪♪♪] I couldn't sleep. [Chuckles sadly] We have food and we have water, we're doing okay. But I'm worried about dad. You know, we'll see how he's doing tomorrow. If he feels up to it, then we're rafting home. How are you holding up? Well, you did really great today. You were brave. I wasn't brave. [Sobs]: I was just really scared, and I wanted to give up. [Crying] Ah, but you didn't, and that makes you brave. [Sniffles] Come on, let's get back into bed. Okay? [♪♪♪] [Laughter and chatter] [♪♪♪] Excuse me? Do you have a remote? [Turns volume up] Once again, I'm recommending this book by first-time writer Robert Childs. I love it. - Wow! - [Patrons reacting] You won't be able to put it down! On dating brainy women: A gentlemen's guide-- it's a winner. And everyone in our studio audience is going home with their own copy today! [Chuckling with giddy anticipation] Stay tuned to your TV, we'll be right back after this short break. I'll be damned! [Patrons murmuring, indistinct] Yeah. Okay. So... I'll bring the paperwork over, and we'll get that organized. Yeah. Louis! Who are you talking to? - Bankruptcy lawyer. - Hang up. Hang up right now! Uh, ed, yeah, listen-- sorry, something's come up, I got to step away from the phone. Yeah, i-- I'll call you back. [Slaps phone shut] [Snaps]: What? You won't believe this. Leanne vickers picked Robert's book as a "must-read." What? [Giggles]: Robert's book has caught fire! Orders are through the roof. We need to order another printing immediately, a big one! No, no. We're not throwing good money after bad. Not this time. Since vickers' show, everyone wants to profile the book. Seattle this morning called, and msnbc wants to interview the author. Really? Mm. Well... [sighs] Here's where I promise away my kid's inheritance. Better get Robert on the line. Yeah, I already left a couple of messages, but I haven't heard back from him. What, you don't think he's still mad at me, do you? [Seagulls squawking] Thanks, baby, that hit the spot. You have a really bad infection, Robert, and the antibiotics in the first aid kit aren't strong enough. I'm going to have to set your leg. Okay? Okay. Okay. [Robert grunts] How's Christy? She's doin' good. Yeah? That is one tough little girl that you raised. [Sighing]: It's in her blood... Her mom was tough. I'm glad she's got you to look up to now. She has both of us. Christy? Okay, I'm going to need your help. Here. Grab that. Go back a little bit. One rope in either hand. Okay. And when I tell you, you're going to pull as hard as you can. Okay? Okay... And when I tell you to. You ready? [Nervously exhales] Ready? Go. [Robert crying out] [Robert continues crying out] [Groaning] [Sobs] [Bone sets and Robert screams] [Screams echo and fade] Huh. [Raps] [Footfalls] Hi. Sorry to bother you. I'm here to see Robert. I'm sorry, he's not in right now. Who shall I say was asking? Oh, pardon me, I'm Louis vale, a friend of Robert's. Hannah Martin, Teresa's mom. Nice to meet you. I, uh, noticed the boat wasn't in the driveway. Are they out on the water? Yeah, they're out there somewhere. I have no idea where. Ah. Well, if you hear from him, please ask him to give me a call? I sure will. Thank you. You're welcome. Mr. Vale? Yes? Do you have a minute? Uh, sure. Sure! I know this sounds silly, but I'm... I'm concerned about the family, about where they are. Oh, I'm sure they'll be fine. Robert's been out on the water many times. It's just that I have this nagging feeling that something's not right. I keep calling them, but they don't answer. Yeah, I've tried to reach him several times myself. Do you think I'm overreacting? No... But, uh, I'll tell you what, just to make sure, why don't we go and see chief Crawford? Oh, that's a great idea. Thank you. I-I'll just get my bag. - You bet. - Okay. Thank you! [♪♪♪] Excuse me. Oh. Chief! Hello, Louis, and madam. Hi. My name is Hannah Martin. Chief, when you get a chance, bill wants you to radio him at the island. All right, set it up. Make sure he gets everything he needs. Yes, sir. Sorry, folks, a lot of excitement recently. We've got a rogue bear, a grizzly, attacking campers. As I was saying, my name is Hannah Martin, my daughter is Teresa Childs, she's married to Robert Childs. I know Robert, known him a long time. [Phones ringing] Apparently, Robert and his family went out on his boat and, uh, we can't seem to reach him. They haven't been answering their cell phones. [Louis]: And it's just not like Robert not to check in. He just had a book released. I'm positive he would want to know what's happening. Have you filed a report? Well, uh-- we tried, but they told us not enough time has passed to designate them as "missing." How long has it been? Well, last time I spoke to my daughter was a day and a half ago. That's not enough time. We tried to reach them on their cell phones. Cell phone reception gets pretty spotty out there. Has anybody tried radioing them? I-I don't know. [Officer]: Excuse me. Chief? Did you know where they were going? Only that they were going boating for a few days. And this was, uh... A day and a half ago? Yes. Puget sound is a big body of water, go one way, you're out in the pacific, go the other and you're in a maze of islands and waterways. Well, what about that storm the other night? Something might've happened. [Chief]: If I know Robert, he would have anchored in a sheltered cove. He's not going to do anything dangerous. Sorry to interrupt, chief, we really need your attention over here. They haven't been missing long enough, if they're even missing at all. You have to wait 48 hours. My hands are tied, there's nothing I can do. I'm really sorry about that. I'll ask other boaters to keep an eye out for them, and to report in if they see anything. And to tell you the truth, when I go on vacation, I don't answer the phone, either. But-- I gotta go. Thanks, chief. Well... Ridiculous... I can't wait another 48 hours to begin looking for them. I don't know, Hannah. Like the chief said, we don't even know if they're really lost. You know, I got this really weird phone call last night. It just sounded like white noise in a tunnel, but the more I think about it, the more I know that was Teresa on the other end. I just know it. Hannah, I'm sure they're going to be fine. Just try not to worry too much. So, what're you going to do, you going to head home? No. I'm going to make a nuisance of myself. Hell, I can be a real pain in the neck when I set my mind to it. [Chuckles]: Antagonize the chief, huh? Good way to get his cooperation. Well, look, if-- um-- if you, uh... Need anything, or you hear anything, here's my card. Just give me a call, all right? Thanks, Louis. Try not to worry. Yeah. [♪♪♪] [♪♪♪] Okay. What do you got? Oh, hell. I haven't seen tracks that big before. It's grizzly track. I ain't seen a grizzly in these parts since I first started guiding. That explains why, uh... Two darts couldn't take him down. [Scowls]: This ain't no pesky black bear. We got ourselves a rogue bear, a pissed-off grizzly. Now what? We got to try and head him to the north end of the island, before he hurts somebody. Fire a round off. [Gunshot echoes] Hunters! Hello! [Together]: Hello! Help us! [Teresa]: Can anybody hear us? We need help! [♪♪♪] Fire another one! [Gunshot echoing, women shouting] Hello! Hello! We could shoot up a flare? No. They're over a mile away... They'll never see us. They're going the wrong way! They're going away from us. Someone will be back. Did they hear you? [♪♪♪] Samson and I'll keep on tracking, over and out. Bill just confirmed it was a grizzly. They put two darts in it, and the thing just kept going. This is serious. It's been over 20 years since a grizzly's been in these parts. Tell bill not to take any chances. If they can't tranquilize it... He should take the bear down, if necessary. Yes, sir. Uh, bill, this is headquarters-- [♪♪♪] How you feeling? It's not good. I have to go for help now, Robert. Christy can stay here and take care of things. Maybe, um... Maybe you should take Christy with you, in case I... Nothing is going to happen to you. Nothing. Teresa! Teresa! Christy? Christy! Christy! Christy! [Twig snags] Christy? Teresa, what's happening? Christy! [Branches crackle] [Snarling] Christy, don't move. [Roaring] [Gasp in terror] Grab a rock, start throwing! [Roars] Keep throwing! [Fires flare gun] It worked. He's leaving. Yeah, but he's going to be back, 'cause he knows there's food here. What happens when he comes back? We're not going to stick around and find out. I was just going to fight with him. It's okay, honey, go down, very slowly. Ms. Martin? Is there anything I can help you with? There's a coffee shop down the street. No, thank you, I'm fine. Just getting a breath of fresh air. I'll be right back. Okay. It's time to go for help. No, but you can't just leave us here, and a bear out there! I'm not leaving anyone behind. What are you doing? We are taking this raft over to the mainland. I guess it got destroyed in the storm. What are we going to do now? [Cash register ticks rapidly, murmur of crowd] Where have all these people been? I know. It's nice, huh? Hey, what did the police have to say about Robert and his family? Well, they're not officially missing yet, but chief Crawford seems to think that there's nothing to worry about. Yeah, I thought so. He's probably out on the sound, you know, disconnected from the world, enjoying his family. The today show called. They want to interview Robert. What do we tell them? [Groans] Just... Tell 'em he's on vacation, and that he'll call as soon as he comes home. Yeah, but if all this happened because of a little profile with leanne vickers, what do you think is going to happen after an interview with the today show? We have got to find Robert. This is his big shot, and he is totally missing it. Yeah, I know. Excuse me. [Telephones ring, hum of busy station] Ms. Martin? Why don't you just go home? Just resting my eyes. Is there any news? We've sent a request out to air-and-sea rescue to make radio contact, and if they don't hear back, I'm sure they're going to mobilize, considering there was a storm in the area. We should hear back soon. You know, if you go home, I can call you when something happens. No. Chief says we haven't waited long enough. Well, I want to make sure I'm first in line when he decides it's time. Well, I'll tell you what. I will call you personally, i give you my word. You're a nice girl, Evelyn, but I want to make sure... [Raising voice]: He knows I'm here! Well, he knows you're here now. I'll be waiting. Okay, so what exactly are we doing? We are making a stretcher to carry your dad out of here, because we can't stay here any longer. You know, you're so different. What do you mean? I thought you were somebody else. No, I've always been me. I don't know, I just kind of felt like i had some stranger living in my house. Hi. I'm Teresa. [Chuckles]: Hi. I'm scared about tomorrow. Oh, honey, no, don't be scared, and for tonight, the bears are scared of fire. We have to take care of dad. Oh, we will, okay? And we're going to take care of each other, too. 'Cause we're stronger when we work together like a family. You know, could you give me some of that cross-bracing over there? [Shivering and crying out in her sleep] [Echoes of bear growling] [Yelps] [Gasping in panic] [Shouts] [Bear growling and roaring] [Screams echo] No... [Gasps in fright] Come on, boy. There's a nice boy... [Telephone rings] Hello? Oh, hi, Hannah, it's me, Louis vale. Have they found them? Uh, no, not yet, but we are following your lead. We're just on our way down to the set of the Seattle this morning show. Why, to talk about Robert's book? Yes, but mostly to talk about the fact that Robert and his family are missing. Now, they're going to help us out here by airing the segment a couple of times during the day. That's great. The police won't like it. [Laughs] The police will get over it. Anyway, what I want you to do is gather up some family pictures. I just talked to a friend of mine down at the local community TV. They're going to send a reporter down to meet you. She'll meet you at the police station. I'm on it, Louis. Thank you. Not a problem, Hannah. Just try not to worry. We're going to find them, all right? Yeah. Yeah... Bye. Bye-bye. You ready to go? Yeah. Door's open. All right, thanks there. [Police radio squawks] We asked the police, but... You know, my family, they loved the outdoors. They went boating on the islands a few days ago, but we haven't been able to reach them. Do you know where they were heading? We think they went camping on one of the islands, but since the storm, I haven't heard from them, and I am worried sick. Once again, we are talking about novelist Robert Childs, who is missing, along with his family. Okay, I got enough. I better go, I want to make my deadline. Be sure to send those pictures over to me. Well, I will. This is great that you were able to do this, thank you. Good luck, Hannah. I'll do my best to get this on the air for you. Yeah. Come on, let's go. [Groaning] Are you sure you're up for this, dad? Yeah, I'm good, kiddo. Where's Teresa? She's getting something from the boat. Okay. Hey, you all right? Do you still miss mom? Every day, baby. Me too. I don't want to forget what she looked like. Well, just look in the mirror, honey. Do you love Teresa more than you loved mom? It's not about that, honey. I love Teresa with the same deep kind of love I had for your mother. It's that same deep love that I have for you. Teresa loves you like that, too. [Teresa sighs] Now, you didn't really think we'd leave without your lucky compass? [Chuckles] Didn't work so well the other night, did it? Hey, honey, we can't take all of the this stuff. But we need it all. No, no, we don't. We got to get rid of this. We're going to keep the food bag, survival kit, emergency kit... But what are we going to sleep in? Hopefully, in our own beds tonight. All right... And if not, then we are going to build a big fire and a shelter. Let's see. All right... Thank you, honey. Up, up, up. Robert, you ready? Anytime. Christy, ready? Yeah. Let's go. [Panting and struggling] Dad, are you okay? Yeah, I'm all right, honey. Sorry I can't help you guys. [♪♪♪] Bear. [Growling softly] [Whispering]: What do we do? He sees us. [Roars] Go! Go, Christy, pull! I can't! He's too heavy! Honey, you have to help me here! Robert, get rid of stuff! He's still coming. Hurry, pull! Okay, he stopped for the food, but keep pulling! [Panting and sobbing] Don't stop, don't stop. [Snarls and roars] What now? Put down the harness, and we have to go across the river. Hurry! Okay, grab it. Okay, pull! [Roaring] Guys... Guys? He flipped over! He's going to drown! [Roaring] Keep pulling! [Roars] Robert! Dad! [Roaring] You have to go around and pull. Robert! Pull! Pull, pull! [Roaring] Come on! [Roaring] Dad! Robert! Robert! Pull him, honey. [Roaring] Robert! Watch his head, watch his head. Robert... Come on... [Sobbing] Okay, okay... [Sobbing]: Please... Robert, come on. Come on, Robert, come on! [Roaring] Don't you do this to me, Robert! [Sobbing] Stay with me, Robert, stay with me... Don't leave me... [Spluttering] [Crying in relief] [Roaring] Oh, my god. Okay... Can you move? Help me get him up, into these trees. [Gasping and panting] Okay, put him down here. [Groans] Do you still have your cell phone? Give it to me. What are you doing? I'm going to use the battery to create a spark. Come on... Come on... Okay, we need more bark. [Crying] This is not going to help. Stop that. [Sobbing] All right, enough. Enough. [Telephone rings] Hello? Hi. Could I speak with Teresa Childs, please? No, I'm sorry, she's not here right now. Can I take a message? This is her mother. This is the doctor's office. We ran the test again, and it came back positive. Oh.... She's pregnant. That's great news. You'll pass that along for us? Yes, I'm sure she'll be very happy to hear that. Thank you. Thank you. You're welcome. Goodbye. Oh... [Dog starts barking] Cody... What is it? What is it, boy? [Barking insistently] Cody, it's okay. What is it, boy? What is it? Oh. Out of the way, Cody. Hi. Can I help you? I'm star, Christy's friend. I'm just returning some movies I borrowed. Oh, thank you. Will she be back soon? Yes, I hope so. Okay, bye. Star... Christy didn't happen to tell you where she... Where they were going, did she? She mentioned bear island. Thank you. Thank you so much! Cody... Guard the house. [♪♪♪] Evelyn! What are you doing here? I told you I'd call if-- i know where they were headed. Bear island. Are you sure? Yeah. Wait here. Hurry. Please... hurry. Chief... Hannah Martin's back. Hey, don't even fool around like that. She's making us look bad here. She said the family went camping on bear island. Bear island? Bill and Samson are still tracking that grizzly out there. We'd better give them a heads-up. What if the grizzly finds the family first? I don't even want to think it. Let's get bill and Samson up to speed. Yes, sir. I know he's around here somewhere. Terrific. That son-of-a-gun had to come out somewhere, somewhere around here. Check for tracks down there, bill. All right. Bill! What do you got? Some busted-up cabin cruiser. Anybody on it? Nope. Looks abandoned. Headquarters, this is deputy smalls. Bill, this is Crawford. Yeah, we got a busted-up boat West Side of bear island. Any signs? No, but, uh, our grizzly's still active. Stay with the bear. I'll get search and rescue to check out the boat. 10-4. Clear. You haven't said anything in a while. I'm trying to figure out what to do next. You going to leave us? Yeah, honey, I am. If I head east, I should hit some campgrounds by evening, or at least early morning. Why can't we just go together? Because your dad can't make the trip. I don't want to spend another night out here. I really want to go home. Oh, honey, I know. Me too. Okay, but I have to do this, and you have to stay for your father. Are you okay with that? Yeah, I can take care of him till you get back. I know you can. Now, I want you to keep that fire going, okay? Because bears are scared of fire. It's going to be okay. I'm sorry. Teresa, I was so mean to you. Oh, honey, no... No, honey, that's okay. It's okay. You know what? We're going to be home soon, and we're going to start all over again, okay? Come back soon. I will. I love you. I love you, too, honey. [♪♪♪] [Rustling] [Rustling] Hello! Hello! Hello! Oh, bill, we got a problem. Human tracks. Two, maybe four hours old. The grizz track's right on top. He's following them. They're heading south-easterly. What do you want to do? Well, we can cut back downwind, set up an ambush, and get to whoever owns these tracks before the grizz does. Let's do it. [Branches rustling] [Rustling] [Bear roars] [Yelps] [Bear snarling] [Clears throat gently] Cute title. Is that your son-in-law's book? Yes. Yes, it is. It's very good. It's very funny. Is it a self-help book? I thought so, too, but, no, it's actually a very sweet story about how he... Met and fell in love with my daughter. The brainy woman. Well, I see where she gets it. One of my deputies spotted a boat beached on the rocks at bear island. That's them. I-is that them? Let's not jump to conclusions. We don't know. We have the coast guard on the way, and I have a deputy on the island who's searching for them. I know it's them, I just know it. Please hurry. We will. I got to go. Just let me know if you need anything, okay? Thank you. Thank you. This is air spotter 4194. No sign of them on this coastline, over. [Radio chatter] Chopper delta, do a grid search north to south on bear island. Over. Copy. initiating search grid. Chopper delta over. [Growling softly] [Feedback whines loudly over walkie-talkie] Dammit! Tracking team, this is rescue 8-4-niner, come in. [Sighs] Yeah, go ahead, bravo. Bravo, we're on the east side of bear island, about 12 miles from hatchet's cove, following-up on a report on a capsized fishing boat, over. Yeah, well, I called that in an hour ago, so if you're just getting to the water now, you're not quite there. You need to go to the west side of the island, over. Copy that, bravo, West Side. Rescue, we... Be advised we found a set of tracks. How many sets, bravo? Over. Single. Over. Be advised, we're looking for two adults and one child. Be advised we'll follow those tracks. Over. Roger. Over and out. Just hope he finds it before the bear does. Aye, sir. He ain't eating anymore, just tears them apart. That son of a gun ain't right. He's heading west. He's zigzagging and back-tracking all over the place. We got to watch he doesn't sneak up behind us. No more screwing around with these darts. We got to kill him before he kills someone else first chance he gets. Let's back-track up the trail a bit, and see if we can find some fresh tracks. Yeah. There! Right there. Over there. Bring 'er straight in. Slow her down, now. We don't want to bump into anything. Let's just take a look-see. Nah, it doesn't look good. That was a pretty nice shot, honey. Dad! [Robert groans] Hey... Hey, how's it going? Oh, not too good, honey. Well, Teresa said she was going to be back soon, okay? So just hang on. Okay. Nah, there's nobody in here. Where's that bullhorn? Good. Can anyone hear me? Hello! Can anyone hear me? This is the coast guard! Dad, someone's on the shore. Help! We're over here! Someone help us! We're over here! This is the coast guard. Hello! What are you doing? I have to go back to the shore before they leave. Teresa said that bears were scared of fire. Wait, Christy... I love you, dad. Wait. Christy! Christy, they're... Christy! [Coast guard calling distantly] Christy! Hello! This is the coast guard! Someone help us! Hello! Hello! Someone help us! Hello! Someone please help us! Hello! Can anyone hear me? This is the coast guard. Help us! Please help... Please help us. [Struggling] If anyone's out there, can you please respond! [♪♪♪] Someone help us! I can hear you! Just stay where you are! Come on. Command, this is rescue 8-4-niner. We have a survivor. Stand by. You have to help my dad. He's really hurt. This is 8-4-niner we're going to need a medical evac. Our GPS is on file. Get the kit. Show me where he is. Hannah... You're going to the pier. They found your family. Oh, is everybody all right? I don't have any details, but everybody's alive. I've got a car outside. [Crying]: Oh... We can't leave Teresa out there. We're not going to, miss, but right now, we need to get your father onboard and stabilized. I've called a rescue chopper, and we will find her. Stay with your dad right now. He needs you. [Sirens wail] Robert? Is he all right? Is he going to be all right? Where's Teresa? I don't see Teresa. They're still looking for Teresa. What? They can't find Teresa! [Sobbing] Shh, shh... [Wolf howls distantly] Ow... Hang on, Robert. He's stalking us, isn't he? Let's back-track up the trail a bit. We'll see if we can pick up some different tracks. [Rustling] Shh, shh! Bear, bear... [Bear grunts and snarls] [Bear growls] [Roars] Lady, lady! Get out of there! Don't shoot, you might hit the woman! Lady, get out of there! Get out of there! Look out! Look out! Come on, bear, over here! [Snarling] Come on... [Roaring] [Samson grunts, his knife slices] Shoot him, bill, shoot him! [Bear roaring] [Samson groans and shouts bear roars] [Men cry out rifle goes off] [Snarling] You okay? Yeah, yeah. Go help the woman. Go help the woman. [Wincing] [Snarling] [Bear roars, Teresa yelps] [Thud] Ah! [Growling] Someone help, please! [Bear roars, Teresa screams] Ah! [Roaring] [Claws rake, Teresa gasps] [Roars] Hey! Over here! [Rifle blasts] [Bear snuffles and snarls] [Rifle blasts again] [Bear groans weakly] Lady, let's go, come on! You're safe, come on! I got you, come on! This way now, come on! Grab my hand. Let's go. Up, up, up, up. [Bear groans faintly] Rescue one, this is deputy bill smalls, bear island. We need medical assistance immediately. [Sirens wail, helicopter whir overhead. Teresa... Teresa... Mom... How's Robert? He's good. We had a little scare with him, but he's going to be fine. Oh, thank god. Christy? She's great. She said you were amazing. Mm. My god, I was so scared out there, mom, but I had to keep going 'cause they were counting on me. That's courage, honey. That's courage... [♪♪♪] [Hum of conversation] [Chatting quietly] Have a great time. Your father's book is doing very well. Yup, number one with a bullet on the New York times best-seller list. Yup... Ladies and gentlemen, if I could have your attention, please. I'd just like to thank you all for coming here and helping us celebrate six months on the New York times best-seller list, our very own Robert Childs. [Cheering and applause] Well done, Robert! Congratulations! Thank you. Well, I don't know about you, but I think it's time for another book. [Applause and murmurs of agreement] I'm already thinking about it. [Laughter] Bob, congratulations. Hey, thank you. Thanks. And thank you all for being here. Thank you. [Conversations resume] [♪♪♪] Thank you. Well, I'm super excited to have a little brother. Aw... Hey, so, I had an idea, guys. What do you think about paragliding in the Amazon? We could camp in the jungle. [Teresa and Christy]: No. All right, that's okay, because what I really want to do is go kayaking on snake river. [Teresa and Christy]: No. Okay, how about... Trekking through the himalayas with yaks? No! Oh, come on, that's a great idea! I could put a baby seat on one of the yaks. Just tell me you'll think about it... [♪♪♪]
