[narrator] The Superstition Mountains. Twenty-five years ago, a new legend of lost riches was added to the likes of the Lost Dutchman Mine and all the others. An armored car loaded with $7 million vanished from the face of the earth right in the shadows of the Superstition. And started a blood feud between two families, the Duros and the Brands, that has lasted till this day. A quarter of a century later, with the people of Backbend still believing that Hank Brand was the murdering mastermind behind the robbery. I tracked down his sons and one beautiful young woman lost in the middle of nowhere. When they told me their story, well, I realized the secret I've kept for all this time must finally come into the light. But I can't tell you my tale without first telling you theirs. Like most treasure stories, this one started with a dream. Only this dream turned into a nightmare. And that nightmare haunted Hank Brand until the day he died. [guns clicking] [Warren] Damn it, Manny. Stop screwing with that gun back there. What the hell's the matter with you today? [Manny] Why do I always have to ride in the back? I'm boiling back here in this goddamn oven. [Hank] My, my! Aren't we agitated today, boys. What's wrong, Manny? Losing big at the track again? -[Manny] Cram it, Warren. -[Warren] Hell, Manny, why don't you just grab a handful of the seven million back there and buy yourself a fan? It's the biggest load we ever hauled. -They won't miss a few bucks. -[Manny] Why don't you shut up? [Warren] Guess you blew it, hey, Manny? If you'd joined the sheriff's department like your big brother Wade, you'd be riding around in an air-conditioned squad car right now. [Hank] Wade's a fat prick, by damn. -[Manny] I said, shut up! -[Hank] Both of you, cool it. We got a lot of boring road in front of us. Look, there's enough heat in this cab without you two continually going at it. [Warren] Whoa, Hank, will you look at that broad? Damn it, Hank. Turn on the wipers. What happened? Where'd she go? Christ! Look out! [tires squealing] [Hank] Something ain't right. That detour wasn't on the route map. Get on the horn. Get on the horn! Phoenix 1. Phoenix 1. This is Range Rider 3. We've been diverted from the main road. We should stop! Let 'em have it. [Hank] What are you talking about? Brace yourselves. You guys hear that? Oh, Jesus. I'm getting out of here. [Hank] Damn it, Manny. Get back on the gun. Get back on the gun! [Manny] God, that's dynamite! These guys ain't foolin'. Hank, they got dynamite. What good's a gun? Let's give it up. We're dead men. But then you've known us for 25 years now. [Manny] Sometimes you have to make a choice, Hank. And I've already made mine. Don't fire. It's me, Manny. Don't shoot! [gunshots] [sizzling] [panting] [groans] [grunting] -You're dead, Brand. You're dead. -[grunting] -[screaming] -[grunts] Ow! [grunting] [sizzling] [Hank] Why did you open the door, Manny? Why? Why, Manny? Why? [man 1] There he is. Don't worry. -I'll get him. -[Hank] Oh, not again. Oh, God. [explosion] Todd... [indistinct muttering] I gotta find the truck. Find the truck. Here you go, Dad. [gagging] -What's wrong? -No, Toddy. Call your brother. Dad, I'm here. Calm down. -We don't need Bo. -Oh, please. -Please, son... -We don't need Bo. Please, son. Call him this time, for me. -Please. Please. -He's never come before. Come on, Dad. [Bo] Yeah, and get ahold of Stevens over at the courthouse. Tell him to move for a mistrial. No, still haven't had one. [upbeat music playing] Yeah, that's right, willpower. What? What, you... You sound like you're breaking up. Hello, Ginger. Hello? Dropped off the end of the goddamn world. [narrator] Hank Brand's oldest boy, Bo, left the town of Backbend when he was 18, soon after his mother had died. He worked days, put himself through law school at night and tried to leave the legacy of his father's notoriety behind him. Perfect. I hate the goddamn desert. I hate the goddamn desert! [sirens wailing] [narrator] But when the call came and he reluctantly returned to his childhood hometown that hated him and his family for the murder of Manny Duro, the sheriff's brother, he learned right away that nothing had really changed. [indistinct radio chatter] [thunder rumbling] License and registration. Well, well. Return of the prodigal son. Sheriff Duro. Hey, I was expecting a wake. Instead, I get you. I can't tell you how disappointed that makes me. Pretty fancy set of wheels for white trash. Where'd you pick 'em up? I picked it up right out of the dealer's showroom. Used my gold card. How's that? On the door lock? Late at night, maybe? Let's cut to the chase, Duro. I've been on the road for ten hours. So save your penny-ante harassment for the locals and write out your ticket. I'm an attorney now. Don't school me. Here you go, Mr. Attorney. Just remember, to the folks around here, you're still nothing but the son of a murdering thief. [engine starts] [indistinct radio chatter] Jackson, are you there? [Jackson] Go ahead, Sheriff. Well, it's just like I told you. Brand's oldest son's come back. I want you to get out there and stick to that damn family like a fly on shit. I want to know every move they make. [man] You don't think that's him, do you? [woman] No. Couldn't be. He wouldn't have the nerve. Todd? Jesus, Todd buddy. Look at you. Damn, I didn't realize you were so grown up. Last time I saw you, you must have been about-- -Six. -Yeah, six. It's good to see you, buddy. He's in with the doctor. Close the door, please. [muttering] It's nice to see you too, shithouse. This isn't a charity case, Dr. Pardee. I want you to give him the best. I have the money. Oh, you'll get my bill, Mr. Brand. But I'm afraid even all the money they say your father has hidden away couldn't help him now. Money? Look around here, Doc. Look around! This look like the death of a rich man to you? [labored breathing] Bo. My boy. How you doing, Range Rider? You seen Todd? Yeah. [laughs] He's somethin', isn't he? He's gonna need you now. These last years... caring for me, it's held him back. Don't worry, Daddy. I'll make sure he gets special attention. No... No, he needs you. [coughing] [coughs and gasps] [labored breathing] You know I'll be there for Todd. You know that. Take care... Daddy, what didn't I do? What didn't I do? You never believed in my innocence. You never did. No, Daddy! I had no part in that robbery, Bo. It doesn't matter now! [cries, sniffles] You're wrong. No! [Bo speaking indistinctly] Call Maggie Cohen over at community services, see what she can tell us. It's got to be a special school. No, just give me a list of the top five. No, I'm gonna be bringing him back to LA. [Todd sniffling] [Bo continues indistinctly] [sniffles] [Hank groaning] Shh. [softly] Shh. He's asleep. He's asleep. Shh. [sniffles] [Bo] No more nightmares, Dad. [narrator] The news of Hank's death reverberated across the desert and opened up a heap of old wounds that had never really healed over. [woman] You better come and see. Hey, pretty girl. I saw what you did. You know, I'm talking to you! [minister speaking indistinctly] "Thou anointest my head with oil, my cup runneth over. Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life. And I will dwell in the House of the Lord forever. And be kind to one another, tenderhearted, forgiving one another, even as God, for Christ's sake, has forgiven you. Amen." Thanks, Reverend. We appreciate you showing up. Don't we, Todd? Todd? [lighter clicks] Hey, sweetie. Where you going? How about a ride across town? Where to? Hank Brand's place. The dead man? Jump on. Look what I got. Very nice. This ain't Hank Brand's place, man. I tell you what. I gave you a ride, now you give us a ride. [man grunts] Don't be stupid now. [groans] [engine starts] [men grunt] [laughs] I made a list of all the witnesses. A couple of them are still alive. You know how many times this trail's been gone over? He kept having that same dream over and over again. He was real sure that his bullet hit one of those money bags. Bag of money with a bullet hole through it? That wouldn't prove anything. What would? Finding the truck. Finding the money. Finish your food. -[man 1] Here they come. -[man 2] Here they are. -[man 1] Get out of there, Clovis. -[woman] Here they come. Hey, they're here. Those damn brats. They should have been out of here a long time ago. [man 3] Damn straight. [man 4] Come on, Bo. Let's hurry up. You good neighbors proud of yourselves now? Hell, why don't you use that cannon on us? You've had it pointed at us for years. Good idea. Gary Mackintosh. Well, if it ain't the blast from the past. I put on 40 pounds since the last time you whipped my ass. [shouts, grunts] And I don't wait to be hit first anymore. This is between the two of you. Why the hell didn't you stop this? I just got here. Bullshit. You stood here and watched the whole goddamn thing. I don't know a single reason why you and your brother ought to hang around here. Do you? There's nothing in there. How would you know that? You just got here. [man 1] Get back in there, Brand. [man 2] Get out of here. [woman] Get out of town. We don't need your kind around here. [people muttering] [man 3] Nobody wants your kind around here. [woman] Your father was a murderer, and everyone knows it. -[clattering] -[man 4] Take that, you scum! [indistinct chatter] [laughter and muttering] [man] Aw, man. Son of a bitch hit me. [laughter and chattering] [man] Get out of here. We don't need your kind. [gas hissing] [Bo] Todd, get in here. If there's anything else you want, get it now. No. Everything's gonna be all right, Todd buddy. We're leaving, man. We're leaving. Hey! We're leaving. And not with our tail between our legs. [woman] There they go. [people muttering] [woman] Right. Just go. [people shouting] We just thought we'd help you pass out the rest of Dad's things. [man] Get out of here! Sheriff Wade, you okay? [woman] Honey, are you okay? Everybody all right? [deputy] Come on, Sheriff, let's go get 'em. I'll have a roadblock set up. [Wade] And have half the sheriffs in the territory are laughing at me? Where's your brains, Deputy? [deputy] Just gonna let 'em get away? [Wade] No place they can hide out here where I can't find 'em. [Bo chuckles] [both laughing] [man on radio] Come on, Sheriff. How long am I supposed to look for those two peckerheads? Christ, Wade, let it go. That damn robbery took place in the Ice Age, old man. No one's ever spent a dime of that money. Who the fuck asked you? I'm telling you, Sheriff, the money's gone. No matter what Brand had to do with it. The money is long gone. You're just chasing ghosts. Wade? Wade? You there, Wade? -[knocking on door] -[man] Duro, get out here. It's Hank Brand. I'm bringing this back to you. That's the third one this week. I got a wife and a kid, and I want this harassment to stop. And I want it to stop now. Your brother's death wasn't my fault. I'm sorry about Manny. I truly am. But I got just as much right to live in peace as the next guy. You're talking about this? This is just foreplay. I can be a stubborn son of a bitch. You screw with my family again... you're dead. I'll show you stubborn, you son of a bitch! Every guilty man makes a slip. And when you make yours, even if it takes me forever, I'm gonna nail you to the fucking wall. [narrator] Two days after the confrontation, Hank Brown's truck was firebombed. Hank was badly disfigured by the flames. But no one was ever arrested. Lots of people sent letters. Saying they know stuff about the robbery. Most of them are crazy, you know. But Dad used to check 'em all out anyway. Yeah, I remember him saying... "Son, the final proof will be in the details." Yeah. He said that to me too. Lots of times. I promised him I'd help him. But I never did. But now I can. "You can" what? Well, I'm gonna go to all these places in those letters and I'm gonna talk to those people. And I'm gonna prove that he was innocent. [exhales] What if you can't? Dad spent his whole life trying and he couldn't. You let people believe what they want to believe. They're gonna anyway. It doesn't matter now. Yeah, well, it matters to me, all right? Fine! [sighs] Come on. Get your stuff. Let's get the hell out of here. [upbeat music playing on car stereo] All right, Todd buddy, I'll make a deal with you. We do this thing together. We'll look around. We'll go and talk to any of the witnesses that are still living. If we find something out that everybody else overlooked, we'll check that out too. [chuckles softly] If the trail goes cold again, it's over. I want you to promise me that if and when that time comes, you'll put this thing to rest once and for all... and come back to LA with me. Deal? And I get to drive your car too? Deal? [Bo groans] This is like a spaceship. It's a car, Todd buddy. Would you mind creeping down to lightspeed? This little baby cost me 35 grand. Christ! Don't downshift unless you have to. All it needs is lasers. [tires squealing] [grunts] [groans] Shit. No... [panting] Mm-mm. No. [rock music playing on car stereo] [Bo] What are you doing? Wow. Hi. I really appreciate you guys stopping. [groans] God, are you all right? Yeah, I thought I can walk on it. Todd buddy, give me a hand. Easy, easy. Real easy. All right. -Ow. -Oh, God. What happened? Damned 18-wheeler blew me right off the road. Careful. What do you got there, Todd buddy? Some aloe? Good. [winces] I think we should take her to a doctor. No, I don't need a doctor. I could sure use a ride. Hop in. Just put your hand right there... [softly] Todd buddy, Todd buddy. Where's home? Thataway. That's where we're heading. Uh, I'm Todd, and this is my brother, Robert. But they've been calling him Bo since he was a little boy. I'm Jesse. Jesse. That... That's a beautiful name. Buckle up, Todd buddy. I'd hate to have to stop real quick and see your face go flying through the windshield. [chuckles] I'm on vacation. As of now, Jackson, you're minding the shop. No screw-ups. Look around, Sheriff. This here's Backbend. What's to screw up? You know, if on a ghost of a chance you happen to find that money, what'll you do? You wouldn't kill those boys, would you, Wade? I mean, you wouldn't go that far. What do you think? Well, if those boys don't show up again, I'll be coming after you. Then you'll be the one chasing ghosts. I lost my brother, and my family left me, and I don't care, Jackson. That money is still out there somewhere and I outlasted Brand for it, and now it's all mine. [engine starts] It's out there, all right. She needs a place to stay. She's real nice. She smells good. And she's potty-trained too. Look, Todd, we don't have time for this right now. Besides, we can't go bringing other people into our business. Got to play this close to the vest. Understand? Okay. But can I have my own room? [Bo sighs] I'll unload the trunk and, uh, you can pay for the rooms, okay? I'll unload it. Hey, Jesse. Um, do you still need a place to stay? Because I... I got a room. Okay. Okay, um, just wait 20 minutes, okay? [car approaching] Hey, babe, hop in. No, thanks, mister. [man] Yeah, well, make up your mind. I've got my ride. [knocking on door] [indistinct chatter on TV] -Hi. -Hi. We've got to be kind of quiet 'cause Bo is in the next room. We can watch the TV if you want. I got it on low. Um, you can use the bathroom. I haven't used it yet. Still got the whole paper thing around it, you know. It's okay. Thanks. So, sit down. Thank you. So... where are you from? South. South of here. How far south? How old are you, Todd? I'm 18. I can't stand being close to you, then. I... I can open the door if you want. Oh, no, that's okay. Hello, Mr. Stanislaw. My name's Robert Brand. I hope I'm not calling you too late. Yes, sir, he was my father. Thank you, sir. I appreciate that. -Can I ask you something? -Sure. Back in the car... I couldn't help but to notice. What? Do you always do what your brother tells you to do? I mean, you seem old enough not to worry about what he thinks. I got us a room, though, didn't I? I... I know, it's okay. I just... I just don't want to cause any problems between the two of you. It's okay. Um... I'll sleep here, um, and you can sleep on the bed there. I'm not tired yet. Do you have to get up early tomorrow, Todd? Yeah. Yeah, um, real early. Do you have a lot of driving to do? Yeah, we're going to Su... -Todd? -Bo doesn't like me to say anything. Oh. Bo. We're going to the Superstition Mountains. It's no big deal. Oh, more hot desert driving. Yeah. You know, sometimes I wonder if I'll ever get out of this furnace. You know what I've been thinking about all day today? What? Hmm... I've been thinking about... diving into a cool pool of water. -Yeah. -Let's go swimming. The pool is closed. We'll sneak in. I don't have any swimming trunks. [Jesse chuckles] Come. Come on, Todd. Mr. Stanislaw, I was wondering if it wouldn't be too much of an imposition if me and my brother could come out and see you tomorrow. Well, wanted to ask you a few questions about the Phantom Robbery. Get in, Todd buddy. Come here. Yes, sir, I know it happened a long time ago. Gee, that'd be great. [Jesse laughing] [gasping] This... This is great. I've never done anything like this before. I bet there's a whole world of things you haven't done before. How about this? Lucky bastard. [device beeps] Mm. [horn honking] [man] Hey, knock it off out there! What the hell is the matter with you? Hey, Bo. It's four o'clock in the morning. Get over here. I'm not dressed. Well, it didn't seem to matter last night, did it? Get over here! What? Get your clothes and let's go. She's not coming with us. Why? She's going in our direction. Consider yourself lucky, old man. You had a good night. Now it's time to get down to family business, remember? And that's nobody's business but ours. Yeah, well, I told her about it, so there's nothing to hide, Bo. Sure. Now say goodbye and let's split. No, I'm not gonna say goodbye to her, Bo. Her mom is dying. And... And I told her we'd give her a ride. And her legs hurt real bad, but she only limps when it suits her. She sure as hell wasn't limping at the pool last night. Take a look at her, Todd. That lady's been on the road a long time. She's got more mileage on her than my Michelins. Yeah, well, if we can't give her a ride, then I don't want a ride either. -Fine! -Okay. [engine starts] [brakes screech] All right, you got five minutes. Jesse too? [Bo] Yes, Jesse too. ♪ Loving is easy ♪ ♪ Since I fell for you ♪ ♪ I can't fight the feeling ♪ ♪ That I have for you ♪ ♪ Since I fell for you ♪ How's the leg? I bet it's really hurting you this morning. Yeah, it's killing me. I think I should've just left it alone last night. Should have kept it closer to the other one. We got to meet someone outside of Junction. How far are you going? Junction's right on the way. Yeah. I should have guessed as much. -Hey, Bo? I want to drive. -Later. Maybe, uh, Jesse can drive later too, huh? Don't push it. It's all right, Todd. I don't know how to drive stick anyhow. What's this meeting you're going to? It's got anything to do with seven million bucks? Our business is none of your goddamn business. ♪ Dreaming is easy ♪ ♪ Since I fell for you ♪ ♪ Loving is easy ♪ [Bo] Go on, Mr. Stanislaw. [Mr. Stanislaw] So, here I was, out on this road hitchhiking. God knows there ain't nobody around for miles. And just as I'm beginning to believe that I am stranded... I hear this sound, kind of distant-like, coming from up there. Something was thundering down the road. I look up and I see this black-and-gold Merc. And sitting right on its tail was this huge truck. And they were hauling ass. So I thought I'd try to flag 'em down. Christ! Shit! Rotten fruit. They were hauling rotten fruit. Now, who in their right mind would be hauling rotten fruit? God, I knew they were up to something dirty. And later, when I read about that black-and-gold car -at the roadblock... -Mm-hmm. ...it all made sense. That old armored truck went right underneath my nose. All tricked up to look like a fruit truck. [pop music playing] Coming up on Apache Corners. Where do you want to be let out? Where are you headin'? Okay, that's it. If you won't give me an exact destination, you're getting out at Apache Corners. -No, she's not. -Oh, yes, she is. Haven't you figured it out yet, Todd? She's a gold digger. She's after whatever she can leech off of us. Just knock it off. Come on. [Jesse sniffles] Oh, that's it. Bring on the tears. Poor, poor Jesse. Listen, kid. Thanks for turning Todd buddy here into a first-class slam hound. Eat shit! I'm sure it's something you'll never forget. Maybe you can take care of me too before we dump ya. Ah, screw it. I'm not interested. -Shut up! -You shut up! [music stops] -Apologize. -I'm not gonna apologize. The hell are you doing? -Apologize! -Apologize, my ass! You fucking moron! -[Bo grunts] -[brakes screech] [both grunting] You wanna kill me? Go on and fucking kill me! [Bo exhales] [mutters softly] [Bo sighs] Perfect. Now we're stuck here. We're not stuck here. We still got Ma Bell. Should have her good as new by morning. I'll give the old lady here a call when it's ready. Don't forget, all my work is COD. I sure hope you find that wallet. [engine starts] I talked to the owner's wife on the phone on the way over here. She says she'll rent us two tents and a couple of sleeping bags for five bucks a piece. She'll take a check. She's even gonna throw in a meal for the both of us. Yeah, what about me? You're on your own. Five bucks? Shit, I could swing that. I wonder if I turn you upside down, whether a few of my credit cards will fall out. Come on, search me. You've been treating me like a criminal since you picked me up. Come on. Search me. Don't tempt me. Bang. [chuckles softly] Must be almost there. [tinkling] -[door creaking] -[footsteps approaching] -Hi. -Hi. I'm Madeline Hix. You must be the ones that called. Welcome. I'm Robert Brand. I'm the one you spoke to. Brand, you said? [laughs] Yes. Is that significant? [Madeline] No, no. Should it be? [chuckles] [clattering] [Bo] Shit! Are you all right? [Madeline] You needn't use that kind of language. It was just an accident. We'll pay for the damages. -I'm sorry. -Don't worry about it. Christ's sakes! What the hell was that? It was just an accident. Hush! Go finish your whittling. The Miller party will be arriving soon for their trip to Geronimo's anvil. Those things have survived being buried here in this desert for 150 years of sand, salt and rain. Now, you keep your paws off 'em, son, they might survive 150 more. Damn kid. You pay no attention to that old horned toad. Come on. I'll get you your equipment. You can camp over by the tree line there. It'll serve as a windbreak. Now, you needn't worry about any of those stories you might have heard. Most of the stories about the Superstitions are just pure hogwash. This is really cute on you. Lovely. please. [narrator] I didn't know who the boys were at the time. If I had, I might have saved everyone a parcel of trouble. Here, you see? Surprised to see me, halfwit? I thought you might be. But it's our little secret. You're not going to tell your brother, are you? 'Cause if you do, I'm gonna have to kill him, and the girl, and I'll do it right in front of you. You'll never get away from me, kid. I'll find you no matter where you hide. [owl hooting in distance] [Wade groans] [groaning] Bo. Bo! [Bo] No way! [groaning] Oh, God. Jesse. Jesse. It's past your bedtime. Leave me alone and go to sleep, little boy. [Bo] No, no, no. I need the cash here. No, you don't get it. It's real simple. I can't get to Phoenix to get the cash until I get the car. I can't get the car until I get the cash. Yes, that's right. I need the cash here. What? Three days? Yeah, I'm not in Las Vegas here. I'm in the middle of the goddamn desert! No, I don't want to hold! Great. I'm holding. [Bo sighs] Well, Phoenix happens to be right on my way. I guess I could trust you with a loan until then. Well, that's real big of you, but forget it. Suit yourself, man. I mean, you know, we could be flying down the highway. Hey, buddy, what's it gonna be? I don't need the sunshine. How about a check? You take a check? Cash, brother. I told you when I picked you up. Cash, man. Cash! What's wrong? What's going on? [Bo whispering] The mechanic. Wait. [in normal voice] Hello. Hello. Hello? Shit. So, what about your mother? I thought she was dying. Uh, she shouldn't be dead by tomorrow. It's... -It's a progressive illness. -Mm. -She's got money, Bo. -[Bo] Chill out. Okay, I'll make a deal with you. You foot the bill from here on out. I'll get you back to Phoenix and you'll get your money back. And that's it. End of the trail. Bye-bye. Sayonara. Adios! You're not making a deal here. I've got the cash, remember? You pay me back double whatever we spend until we get to Phoenix. And I'm now a partner in this family treasure of yours. -We're not hunting treasure. -Oh, yes, we are. I am, in whatever shape it comes to me. -No kidding. -Just do it. Come on! Come on, bud. What choice have you got? [Bo sighs] [grunts] [pop music playing on car stereo] [Jesse sighs] -Thanks. -Anytime. So where are we heading? What's our plan? My plan is to be in Marina del Rey by Friday playing tennis by the ocean. A racket in one hand, an ice-cold Corona in the other, and a redhead named Irene bouncing all around on the other side of the net. Sounds deep. You're awfully quiet back there. What did you want to talk about last night? Duro. Wade Duro? What about Duro? -I saw him. -[Bo] What? I bashed him in the skull with a rock last night. [laughs] Get serious. I did. He jumped me just outside our camp. Damn it, Todd. Why didn't you wake me? I tried. I was scared. He's out there, Bo. He's watching us. How the hell did Duro find us all the way out here? Probably followed us. And how the hell would you know his name was Wade? What's this, some kind of accusation, Counselor? I don't know. I saw his name in the clippings. You know, I can read. Or is that something else you despise about me? Listen, stop it. What are we gonna do about Duro now? [Bo] I don't know. I don't know. Let me think. Do you see anybody following us? No, I don't see anyone. [Bo] We'll make this quick and then get the hell out of here before Duro can sniff us out. [Jesse] Why are we stopping here? [Bo] Except for that siding on the road, this is the only place anyone ever got a good look at the robbers. [Jesse] Aside from the armored truck guards. [Bo] Yeah, well, all the other witnesses died. Old Cable's the only hope we've got left. [can pops open] Ah. Thank you kindly. Best in the world when it's free. Isn't that the truth? So you were saying that Mr. Sabatini still lives around here? That old dog ain't gone more than a dozen miles from here ever since he retired from the state police. [scoffs] Says he's on butt patrol now. Shit. Offer him a couple of six-packs, he'd come down here and chew your ear out about that damn robbery. Want me to get him on the horn? Like I said, I can only give you my side of the story. Well, that'd be great. -You got a quarter? -Sure. Sabatini, you old fart hound! Get off your butt! I got a fella springing for beer down here. [siren wailing in distance] [siren stops] Hey, Cable! You cheap bastard! Somebody say "free beer"? [laughing] Mr. Hogue, that fishing trip sounds like it must have been a really good time. But I was wondering if you wouldn't mind jumping ahead to the part where the suspects first showed up. All right. All right. I remember the wind beginning to kick up. I hated to shut the windows 'cause of the fish smell and all, but that dust... went something terrible. The customer bell rang. I wasn't too keen on going out there, but a service station meant "service" in those days. [bell rings] What do you need? [laughing] Gonna hit the can. Sit tight. Be right back. Yeah. Me too. Fill it up, boy, and check the oil. Yeah, sure. Don't go nowhere without us. Boo! Change? [cash register dings] [Cable] Out at the gas station in Asker Springs, there's a couple fellas laughing about an armored car robbery of seven million bucks. [man coughs] [whistles] [horn honking] Hey, doofus, hurry up out there. We don't got all day. Hey! We don't got all day. Trouble. Those two men come back in yet? [siren wailing] [tires screeching] Shh. Come on. The other two were long gone. Vanished. -They get to the Merc somehow? -No, ma'am. There were only two in that Merc. Then can you tell us what happened? Old Cable just shut down for a while. I'll even do better than that. [laughs] I had that Merc up to about 70 before I got up to this corner here. Hang on! [tires screeching] [laughing] And there they were. -And I fired my pistol at 'em. -[gun fires] [gun firing continuously] [siren wailing] [sheriff] Dispatch. Meg, I'm on Route 8. I'm under fire. Meg, listen, we need to establish a roadblock before Sutter's Cutoff. [siren wailing] [Wade] This is Deputy Duro. I got 'em in sight. Let's close it down, Brand. Do it! [gun clicks] [Sabatini] Wade, are they still alive? We're coming. You're just like your greedy brother, Manny. Fuck you. [Wade] You crazy son of a... [explosion] [Sabatini] Come on, it's gonna blow. I never knew what the bandit in the car meant about Manny. It's not every day you find two brothers that close. Manny tagged after Wade his whole life, trying to live up to Wade's example. Wade was a good man, a good officer. He got married and had a family. So did Manny. It was only at the end that they had any trouble between them about Manny's gambling. Anyway, Wade took care of Manny's family till they moved out of town. And then he spent every day trying to avenge the death of his younger brother. He loved that boy. Practically raised him. But that day I... I could tell by the look in his eyes that... those flames had burned something deeper than his flesh. Hell, he wasn't the only casualty. Instead of rewarding me, the papers made me look like a fool for helping the other two escape. [laughing] Why would anyone think that? [Cable] Hell! It was a setup. The call they made from my garage was to the police. $7 million split two ways is better than split four. While the two dupes in the Merc, with a sack full of chump change, were being run to the ground by old Sabatini here, two masterminds were doubling back to where they hid the truck and all the rest of the cash. Did you find where they stashed the truck? We found the tracks. The vehicle had been hidden in a thicket for a while and then moved. From that point on, it was a dead end. Not a thing anywhere... any time. So that's it. You talk to a couple of old-timers and walk away. Todd and I made a deal. Yeah, but I made this deal too, to the tune of 400 bucks. That's $800 owed. You'll get your money when we get to Phoenix. Yeah. -What? -Duro. Shit. [guns cocking] -Hold on! -[tires screeching] Uh-oh. [Jesse] Punch it, ace. Not yet. Not till talk to 'em. We've got to catch that foreign thing thingamabob before they'll be any talking. You do what I tell you to when I tell you to do it. -Take that road. -No. -Take that road! -No! -Take it! -[Bo screaming] No! [Bo] Great idea. Oh, great! [Todd] Come on. Come on! [grunts] [man] Ah, shit! You broke the goddamn crank case! Shut up. Let's go. [bird screeching overhead] [Bo] I hate the goddamn desert. I hate the goddamn desert. I hate the goddamn desert. [Jesse panting] [Bo] I hate the goddamn desert. I hate the goddamn desert. I hate the goddamn... Huh? [man groans] That's it. I ain't going any further. Get up and move. Mister, you ain't paying me enough for this shit. [gun cocks] All right. All right, I guess you ought to know who you've been chasing out here. It's the Brand boys. You know Hank Brand's sons, and you know what they're after. And if you've got any sense left, you can figure out what a share of that'd be worth. You can leave now... and spend the rest of your miserable lives rolling drugs. Or you can follow me and spend the rest of your miserable lives rolling in dough. Hi. [Todd] How'd you find us? [Eli] When I found your car abandoned, I kind of figured you'd be out here on foot. [Todd] Uh, Eli, I'd like you to read. [Eli] No, you'll have to read it to me, son. I didn't bring the specs. "Dear Mr. Brand. I am writing from the intensive care ward of the Sun Valley Hospital where my husband is gravely ill. Over the years, I have read about your plight in the newspapers. Though my guilt is strong, I have waited until now before contacting you. My husband carries information that may help you. I am writing now so that he may have the opportunity of unloading that burden before he passes on. Please contact me at the above address. I pray that you respond quickly. Sincerely, Madeline Hix." That letter was written better than two years ago, son. As you know, the report on my impending demise was greatly exaggerated. Too damn stubborn to die in a hospital gown, I guess. Well, for 25 years, I've been knowing this day would come sooner or later. So I best get it done and set a lot of old ghosts to rest. [chuckles] Hi, Maddie. Got the boys. [Eli] When I told Maddie about the car, she sent me out to look for the boys. I had her collect every weapon she could find. There was more than one fire on the desert that night, and I knew I might be bringing trouble back home. Of course, I kept that part to myself. When the robbery happened, I was out Tucson way, out trying to stir up grubstake. Staked a claim on this old, played-out hole in rock here. And at that time I was convinced that I was really gonna make a big strike. [chuckles] Yeah, you want to hide something well, son? Hide it out in plain sight. Anyways, I came back in a couple of months after the fact to find that everything had changed. The nearest I can piece events together, the truck came through the mouth of my lower original mine. [man] Up near the top, Bobby. And a couple places out back. We'll drop this roof neater than a pin. When things cool off, we'll come back and dig it out. Just like I promised you, Bobby. -That Manny Duro was such a sucker. -[coughing] The perfect heist. No weapons, no witnesses, no sweat. Smooth as the curve on a whore's ass. Oh, yeah, there's just one little detail I gotta take care of. [wind blowing] [explosion] [groaning] [Eli] Those boys must not have been from around here. They sure didn't know anything about geology. Nobody in his right mind would detonate that much dynamite while sitting under a ledge of unstable sandstone. [laughs] A few hours work and I'll be rid of a quarter-century-old headache. Can you believe this? I never thought the truck was intact. Can you imagine if all that money is still in there? "The final proof is in the details." Yeah, if it is, you guys have no claim to it. -What? -The money's mine. -I earned it! -You earned it, bullshit! -Bullshit! -Yeah, bullshit. Our father suffered his whole life for it. My father died for the goddamn money! You're crazy. If anybody's entitled to that money, it's me and Todd. Wrong again. I've got news for you. I've earned a dollar with every tear for my butchered father! The man your father helped kill! Manny Duro. -Fire in the hole! -[explosion] [Bo and Todd coughing] [Eli] Todd, where are the wheel blocks? [Todd] I've got 'em. [grunting] [Eli] Here. Here, son, take that. No, wait a minute. Pry it open. [Madeline] Be careful. Careful. [grunting] [Madeline shrieks, gasps] So there's the fourth man. I thought an awful lot about him. Double-cross on a double-cross. -[gunshots] -[Madeline shrieks] [Jesse shrieks] Ow! [Bo] Eli! -It's all here. -Well, for how long? [gun clicks] Shit! What the hell am I doing here? [groans] Son of a bitch. Jammed again. [grunts] [grunting] [grunts] [yells] Oh, no. Oh, stop it! It won't stop! The brakes are out! We're gonna die, we're gonna die. No, we're not! No, we're not! Oh, shit What was that? [thuds] [Todd exhaling] This thing won't open! [yells] Oh, shit. [laughing] [crying] [wailing] Daddy! [crying] [screaming] [grunts] [grunting] [Todd mumbling indistinctly] You wanted proof? It seems like while my father was plotting a permanent vacation to the other side of the world... [voice shaking] your dad was just trying to do his job. -How's the leg? -[laughs] It's getting better every day. Well, we're gonna hit the road. Just wanted to say goodbye. I hate to see you go, son. Hey, I just wanted to thank you and Maddie for all your help. -Is she here? -Well, uh... That brother of yours, he sure is a fine boy. Now, you watch after him, will you? You bet. Eli, there's something I just don't understand. Thought maybe you could clarify it for me. What's that? How could you have that treasure here all these years and never tell a soul? [chuckles] That's simple, son. I just don't like folks poking around in my little old gold mine here. -Gold mine? -Yeah. [sighs] Well, it's funny the value we put on things, isn't it? It sure is. -Well... I'll see you. -Thanks again. Okay. -Say goodbye to Maddie for me. -Will do. -Bye. All right. -Thank you. And Maddie and I, I guess you could say we're out $7 million. What did the boy want, huh? Well, he just couldn't understand why I hadn't touched any of the money. [chuckles] But like I said, there's more than one legend in the Superstition Mountains. Todd made up his mind to stay when it really came time to leave. This was Dad's. I think it fits you. [Eli] The boy had no use for the city, and in his heart, his brother knew it and accepted it. I'll see you, Bo buddy. See you, Todd buddy. -Hey, drive safe, okay? -Okay. Hey, Todd buddy! I'll see you, okay? [Bo chuckling] No, no, no. What? There's something I got to ask you. What? How was she? What do you mean? Jesse. To sleep with? I never slept with her. [upbeat music playing] [Eli] And Bo. [chuckles] Well... Bo buddy. Did you actually think I was gonna let you get away that easy? The way I figured it you still owe me 800 bucks. [Bo exhales] And a quarter. You know something? I love the goddamn desert.
