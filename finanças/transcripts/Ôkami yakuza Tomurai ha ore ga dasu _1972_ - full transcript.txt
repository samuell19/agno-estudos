YAKUZA WOLF 2 WARNING US AIR FORCE INSTITUTION Hey, what did he say? "We're leaving Japan tomorrow." "So this is gonna be your last chance." "You gonna sell them to Japanese gangsters anyway." "So raise the price," he said. After taking so much money already? We're not suckers. Ibuki, make sure you deal with them right. Sure thing. We won't pay more. All right. Three million as promised. That's all we can pay, okay? If you don't like it, just go home. Get thrown in jail for the damn guns! Semba. Ibuki, drop your gun. Drop it! Semba, our deal is tomorrow. I changed my mind. We're taking all the guns and money now. Hold on. You and I got along well. - Why betray me now? - I'll count to three. Just leave while you still can. It's the least I can do for you. Don't move! One. I see. Sakurada sent you here. Two. Three. Masao, get out of here. - Damn it. - Masao, go now! Hold on. Let the police do their job. We got what we wanted. Masao. Hey. Hang in there. Ibuki. You should go. Now. Don't be silly. How can I leave you here? Ibuki. - Hey! Masao! Masao! - Don't move! - Get up. - Wait. Come. Ibuki. Finally I got you. We'll have a lot to catch up on. I knew you'd come. My least favorite cop. You sneaky snake. Kemmochi, why are you here? Just to make sure you die here. - What? - Look behind you. - Kuki. - You all. Sorry. You aren't our boss anymore. Mr. Kemmochi is. We have no use for a weak organization. You! Semba. Times have changed. Your violence won't do any good to the Touoh-kai. - Today's deal was your last job. - Is this Sakurada's order? Run, Boss! Nishio! FIREARMS TRAFFICKERS ARRESTED BREAK-UP OF SEMBA GROUP FIVE YEARS LATER Bastard! Come on, baby. Come on. Hit him back! Look at him. A loser! Now what? Screw you! I love cleaning. I've finished. Oh, hello. - You know what? I was a boxer once. - How come you end up here? I was involved in a fixed match. I was stripped of my license. But I needed money, so I did the robbery. A boxer-turned-robber, eh? Hey, when you get out of here, why don't you work with me? I have a good job to do. It'll make a million for each of us. - A million? - Not a bad deal, right? - What a small job. - What? My business will bring 100 million. - Hundred million? Really? - Yeah. Hey, let me join you. I knew you have the power to draw big money. You're something else. Come on, let me join in it. It's a risky job. I know. The greater the risk, the greater the gain. So are we robbing the Bank of Japan? You tend to think small. I'm talking about a much bigger organization. I'll do it, anyway. - Let's get started. - How? - We're in prison. - We'll leave. We can't just... Hold on. You mean a prison break? I'm sick to death of being here any longer. - Who enjoys being here? - I have a plan. With your help, it'll definitely work. It's the warden. He comes once a week on patrol with guards who have a bunch of keys. When he comes to the next cell, I'll make a fuss. I'll kill you, bastard! No doubt they'll rush to our cell and a circus will begin. Beautiful! No, no. He's not going anywhere. - Here we go. - Okay. - Hey, hurry up. - Yes. Okay. - Let's go. - Hey! Open it. - What's this? - Oh, that? That's for-- Right? One, two. - Toru Ibuki. - Yes. - Goro Yuki. - Yes. I heard that you've done a good work. I'm flattered. It wasn't that good. - I'm terribly sorry. - You should be. - I got him involved. It wasn't his fault. - Hey. - Stop acting cool. - What? Anyway. I've got a full report of what you've done. The other day, you stopped a fight in a cell. Two of you worked together to settle it. What? As a matter of fact, there was an amnesty for the return of Okinawa. - Thanks to that, you'll be released soon. - We'll be released? I'll let you know when. All right? That's all. This is not what I expected. What a surprise. I don't even know how I feel right now. Am I happy or disappointed? Amnesty for Okinawa's return? He told me that. Mr. Kambe. Are you sure about this? This is what I do for money. I'm sure about it. Even after being sacked, I'm in the know about the police work. My information is worth the reward. How lucky Ibuki is. He was supposed to be in prison for another year. Luck is fickle, you see? I haven't told you, but I have a thing to do apart from the job we talked. - What is it? A girl? - Sort of. What about me? There he comes. Got a flat tire? Hey, get up. - Arakida. - Just come. Or I'll send you to the crematorium for real. - Let's go. - Okay. All right. Okay. Forget it. - Are you okay? - It's nothing. Just a bruise. I've got a hole. You think I can still use this coin? - It saved your life. - That's true. It's a dumdum bullet. Dumdum? It may not penetrate, but it'll make a big hole. Only a pro uses it. So a killer shot us. Who's that guy? Brother of my late partner who was killed five years ago. - He came to pick you up? - I don't know. He got out of the shady business ages ago. So there's no way he'd come for me. But in a funeral car. Crap. What? Interesting. A funeral car is packed with smuggled goods. CHINATOWN SEAMEN'S HOTEL Arakida, I have a favor to ask. What's that? I want guns. Two of them. You're the only one I can trust for this. I won't cause you no trouble. Please. You're going to avenge my brother? Why not? I never forget what happened five years ago. But the Touoh-kai today can't be crushed with two guns. - I'm aware of that. - Forget it. You'll be safe while you're here. But remember. I won't take care of anyone who gets himself into trouble. Arakida. What about your brother's death? - Are you being a coward? - Shut up. - I just don't want you to die. - Forget it. I'd rather have died in prison if I had to give it up. You haven't changed at all. So reckless. If you want to die, go ahead. I'll hold your funeral. I wouldn't necessarily die. Let me do it my way. For the past five years, I've been thinking about it, looking at the ceiling of the prison. They killed my partner. They also snatched all of my money and guns. I swore revenge. No way I'm giving it up. I know how you feel. But listen. What can you do without any guns? Guns. I used to have loads of them. Yes, come in! - Boss told me to bring you some supper. - Thanks. Let's eat something. Look. GO AND HAVE FUN I like him. When the rain stops It's time to say goodbye The days we spent, our memories Let them all flow away On the south window That will never be opened again I'll draw the blue curtain It's time to say goodbye About Ibuki. - You failed? - How did you know? I just thought it might be. He's a wounded wolf on the loose. - You never know when he'll attack us. - He'll surely come here. I've set a bait for him. It's her. When the rain stops I'll be alone and cry THE TOUOH-KAI: KEMMOCHI'S OFFICE Hey, can I have a light? I like your tie. - The Semba's office used to be here. - Semba? So outdated. His organization collapsed years ago. Is that so? - Who are you? - Me? I'll tell you now! What? Semba, he said? - Who's this guy? - Nobody knows. Just a stranger. - Maybe Ibuki's man? - Get him. Open it! - Semba isn't here. - Let's go. One, two, three! You! Seen strangers? No. Just a rat. No. Something else is here. Damn it. DRESSING ROOM Mari. Toru. Why? How come you're here? Since when? - What happened? - Don't ask. I'm not a girl you used to know. - Mari. - Stay away! Ibuki. - We're cornered. There's no way out. - What? Wait. What are you looking at? Go away! Now you know. I've changed. I'm dirty that I'd rather be dead. Tell me. Who did this to you? Mari. - Who did it? - Go now. - But we can't get out. - Use the window over there. Hurry. I'll go first. Found him? Mari. I'll come for you. I promise. This way. I knew you'd come to see your woman. What? I see. It was you. She was too pretty to be left alone for five years. And she was the best bait for you. You. I'm glad you got out of prison. I'll take a good care of you. With this gun. Now I know why you nabbed me five years ago. The cop kept by the Touoh-kai. He's now become a killer. How low you've fallen. Sneaky snake. Even if I have, I'm still a good shot. Hold on. Can't you count? What? You're on your own but we're two of us. If you shoot Ibuki, you'll soon be shot. I'll shoot you right back. Which of us will win? We'll see. Head? Or heart? I know. You don't shoot an unarmed man. - Hey. - Over there! - I'll come again. - Go after them! Say it. You still love Ibuki. So you let him get away. I don't know if he came back. I don't care if you still love him. But I'll make you realize... what kind of girl you are now. Please don't. That dirty cop! Sakurada made him to trap me. That sneaky snake. He's been paid by Sakurada for five years. And top of that... Damn it. You saw her, right? Women are vulnerable. Soon after you got nabbed, Kambe made her his mistress by force. Don't blame her. Now you know that being reckless is not the way to go. Thanks for helping me. But it's no use trying to stop me from fighting them. I'm not trying. Besides, I wasn't the one who helped you. Who was it then? Search me. Looks like we can't handle this job on our own. And we can't rescue her either. They're three men who were in the basement, the sneaky snake ex-cop. And don't forget the hitman who shot us when we got out of prison. We need at least five of us. What are you looking at? Having a good time, eh? - How about those three? - No way. Hey! You're not from here. Come on. You know whose territory it is? Who cares? I'll make money wherever I want. Let me go. What the heck? You! You stupid punk! Take this! And this! Bastard! You want more? Go. Be careful of crazy fellows. You'll get hurt. That bearded man will win. You sure? The three have daggers. Want to bet? Two or three of your ribs are broken but you won't die. Better go to the hospital soon. Hey. You're with them? Hold on! Calm down. - We've been watching you. You're great. - Who are you? Your employers. Employers? What do you mean? - Hit me. - Go ahead. - Give him a hard punch. - Show me. It's a test. Give me a hard punch. - You sure? - Of course. Not that serious one. You passed. I've a job for you. Why don't you join us? I won't work for cheap money. Wait. It's the Touoh-kai we're talking about. The Touoh-kai? I'll think about it. - What kind of man is he? - No idea. It's hard to find the right persons for the job. It could've been easier in prison. Hey. Want to try it again? Just the two of us. Absolutely not. A bad plan. You don't want money? What? Of course I want money! But I want to stay alive too. Idiot. I've opened that bottle for you. Hikawa. Is that you? - Hi, Yuki. - You haven't changed. - Where have you been? - Look at this. I've been chasing whales. But they're fewer these days. No work at sea. I'm having too much time on my hands. Meet my ex-partner. He was an amateur, but a good fighter. I'm flattered. He can be a candidate. - What does it mean? - It's okay. Let's check. Good teeth. Good muscles too. I ain't a horse! And your punch is good. I see. It's the Touoh-kai's money. There must be billions earned from my guns in their building. - I want to take back all of them. - Interesting. - A target bigger than whales. - Are you in? No reason to refuse. Of course, I'll join you. - Thanks. - Good. - Now, it's three of us. - It's five of us. - It's you. - I heard you. We'll get the big money for sure if it's the Touoh-kai. So money changed your mind. - Didn't it change yours? - What? I knew you'd come. I'm glad you joined us. But this guy? He's half-fledged. Please let me try. I'll pass your test. - You flunked. - Never mind. If he's half-fledged, I'm one and a half. He and I make two. Don't be so stuck-up! But it adds up. I'm Tameji Okuma, a stevedore. I'm Jiro, known as a vagabond roughneck. I have guts and strength. Strength? Come on. - Never mind about a little burden. - Leave it. Finally, we're five. What about weapons? Two guns aren't enough. - We have this too. - And money? Five thousand and seven hundred yen in total. How much do you have? - I don't have any money. - How about you? What can we do with this little money? We're going to get both money and weapons. Listen. The Touoh-kai's car comes to collect money every day at the same time. They stop at here and there. And also this place. And then they'll bring the money to their office. In charge of collecting the money are an executive and two guards. - Is that right, Jiro? - Sure. So when they have most money is... Just before they enter the building. All right. Let's do it. - That damn kids' bus! - Overtake it. Let's go. You bastard! - We came for you. - Come. Tell us where the collected money is kept? I don't know. In that case, we've no choice. You look like a crap, but I'm going to barbeque you. Don't! I'll tell you! The money is kept in a safe in Mr. Sakurada's room. It'll be used for a big business soon. - A big business? When?? - Don't know. I really don't know! Only Mr. Sakurada and some executives know it. Jiro, keep an eye on this guy. There, there. Be patient. - A role suitable for a half-fledged man. - Hang in there. Half-fledged? Damn it. Listen. Spit out everything you know. You know what? I'm not a softy! Talk! Okay. - Actually, the money is elsewhere. - What? Hello? Boss, it's Ibuki. Ibuki. I knew it was you. - The money for the business? - Tonight at 12:00 p.m. Bring it to the third pier. If not, I'll hand over our guest to the police. He said he'd tell everything. - Is it understood? - You! I heard a whistle. - They must be near the harbor. - What? The place near the harbor and Ibuki is likely to be... I knew it. That man is behind this. - Five hundred thousand yen for each of us. - Too early to rejoice. - We'll get five million tonight. - I know. I just can't wait! I'm sure Jiro wants to see it soon. The Touoh-kai is here. Go and hide quickly! - I know they're here. Hand them over. - Don't know. - If you mess with us, you'll pay for this. - Go ahead and search all you want. - Not in this room. A couple is using it. - Get out of my way! - Can't find them. - Where are they? Hold on. - They aren't here. You fool. - Damn it! Don't move. Don't underestimate me. I can teach you what'll happen... if you mess with me. Get lost. Come out. That was cool. Just like you in the old days. I got what you need. - Show them. - Okay. Dynamites. All right! Let's have fun! They're gone! No funny tricks or you'll die. You bastard! - Thank heavens! - You little punk! Finally we've got a rat. We can use him well. Where's Ibuki? I don't know. Why should I? Fine. I'll just follow my guess. Yes. Sure. Hey, it's for you. From a girl. - It's me. Mari. - Mari. - How did you know I'm here? - Don't come! Hey. It's my turn to invite you here. Bring our money here if you want to help your pal. Understood? They got Jiro. No way. He must've acted without thinking. Jiro. - Take it out. - Take out what? The money you took. One more note. Wait. I'll go. It's my fault. I shouldn't have pushed Jiro away. He wanted to prove he was full-fledged. Let me go for him. Thanks! But no thanks. I'm the one who made him involved in this. I'm responsible. Stop there. They want me. I must go. I'll bring him back for sure. I promise. Ibuki. Toru. I want my pal back. Bring him. Ibuki. I... I didn't talk. I swear I didn't. He certainly didn't. So I've decided to give him a treat. Right in front of Ibuki. Don't worry. I'll send you to hell soon too. Pick one. I'm giving you a chance. But you have to confront these three. You won't survive anyway. It would be a shame if I die without taking back my money. I wish I could watch your business. Too bad. It'll be a week after your death. I'll be watching it from hell. No! Don't! Stop it. Please don't kill him! Please! Don't kill him! No! Toru! No. Toru. Get off me. Toru! Ibuki. I'll make your end easy. Torul! No! Toru! Mari. Toru... I'm happy... I can die for you... Jiro. No! Jiro! Head? Or heart? What's going on? Go and check. Which would be faster? You shoot me or the dynamites blow you up. Ibuki! Take it! And this! Don't shoot! I'm unarmed so don't shoot me. Please. I'm generous, I don't fight with a disabled man. You... you're armed! - Brother! - Yuki. Brother. Come on. Hang in there! - Hold on. - Get them! Don't let them get away! Jiro. You too, eh? We can go together... to the other world. Run... run through... The urban... Jungle... Yuki, stop singing. Keep quiet. I know. It'll be soon. I won't sing anymore. You fool! It can't be. You wanted the money so much, Yuki. How could you die without even getting it? And you, Jiro! You said you're a pro fighter. Come back. And hit me. Jiro. You sure were full-fledged. Yuki. Mari. I'll avenge them. I swear. Ibuki, a visitor for you. Semba? Long time no see. You've been alive. I sort of have. For the past five years, you've caused me so much frustration. - You've caused me the same. - Shut up! Can you shoot me? Go ahead. - I don't blame you. - Hold it. Ibuki. You're aiming at your fellow men. - What? - You didn't notice? They helped you several times. What I saw were your shadows? I was worried about you. So I asked them to protect you. I owed you five years ago. I hope I've already paid for that. When we were floating in the canal five years ago, Arakida saved us. And he gave us shelter. We owe him a lot. I was going to bring you guys together. But you're old enemies of each other. You'd have killed him right away, Ibuki. I've been planning with these two to crush the Touoh-kai and kill Sakurada and Kemmochi. But it was hard when you called me a coward for not avenging my brother. Honestly. I didn't know. I'm sorry. Let's do it together. You'll be a big help. Semba got a piece of information. About the Touoh-kai's business. I'll share it with you. We'll take them down for sure. Our guests from Chicago will arrive today. Be prepared for the business - and make sure everything goes perfect. - Yes, sir. They always use the cottage over there for their business. All right. How about its security? Pretty tight. I still remember it. I can sketch a drawing. Good. We're here. That suspension bridge is the only route. Behind the cottage is a cliff. There should be two on the bridge and five in the cottage. Even if we cross the bridge, there's a risk of being shot from the cottage. Only survivors will be rewarded. All the money and dope, right? At least three of us will survive... or none of us will. Crap. How can we move? Let's see if it works or not. I'll run through the bridge. Cover me. No. You'll fall into their trap. They'll shoot at you intensively. Damn it. I got an idea. Use this. Tie a rope to it and shoot it into the bridge girder. I got it. We're crossing the water by the rope, right? Bridges aren't meant to be crossed only on top. But what about the sound? They'll hear the sound of shooting it. Leave that to me. I'll throw rocks down into the sea when you shoot it. Good. Set your watch right. It's 13:35 now. - We'll do it at 14:00 sharp. - Got it. - What was it? - Only rocks. - Okay. - Good luck. - Hey! - What happened? You all right? Boss, it's Ibuki! - Ready? - Yes. Guard the entrances! - What happened? - Out of bullets. The same here. Spit it out. - Can you use it? - It'll work. You'll see. I have plenty of gum. - It's not enough. Give it to me. - Don't rush me, I'll bite my tongue. Hikawa, cover me. You bastard! I'll kill you! Get off me! Don't take it personally. Semba! Damn it. Don't shoot. I'm unarmed. Kambe! Kambe, I won't spare your life this time. Is it over? Semba and Nishio died. Ibuki. Look at this. I've never seen so much cash in my life. It'll be about 20 million for each of us. Nice, eh? What was it for? Don't forget. We lost our fellow men for that money. Shame on you. Looks like we've done our job for nothing. What? Look at those numbers. They're all the same. Japanese won't be fooled by these. Counterfeit bills. Dope is real. Only the sample is. It's just flour. Sakurada and Chicago guys were trying to cheat each other. Damn it. What idiots we are. What a laugh. THE END
