- What in the hell are you doin'? - Oh, don't get excited, girl. I'm not tryin' to cause any trouble with you. I'm not gonna hurt you, either. Just relax. You sleep well? - What do you think? - Well I just wanna make sure you're comfortable that's all. - When in the hell am I gettin' outta here? - Not till your old man comes up with the ransom, and not before then. Besides, you don't have to worry about it. Big Daddy's gonna be havin' us pick up a girl in a few hours. - You mean, I'm gonna have company? - She's one of your kind. - What the hell do you mean, "my kind?" - Whoa, don't get upset, I didn't mean anything by it. I mean, she's black. She's the wife of an African president. - Man, I don't give a damn what she is. - Well, that doesn't matter. We're gonna be here for a few days, so, why don't we get a little friendly? - Get your damn hands off of me. - You sorry bitch, I'll see you later.

Said he was coming over to see you this morning. - David McLeod, I wonder if that's the same McLeod. [chuckles] Nah, couldn't be. - He says he's an old friend of yours. - I'll be damned, that must be him. I wonder if he's still with the CIA. - The CIA? - Yeah, when I first started out in Harlem as a detective, David was a CIA man. Helped me out of a couple really rough spots. - I wonder if any of those rough spots had anything to do with girls. - Sue, I wonder where you get such a dirty mind. Have him come in as soon as he arrives. - Sure. - Uh, yeah. It's Mr. Freeman. Thank you. Hello, listen, I'm wondering about that check you're supposed to send us. Uh-huh. - Yes, may I help you? - Yes, you may. I'm David McLeod, is Al Connors in? - Oh, yes, he's expecting you, you can go right in. - Thank you. - Thank you. Well, look who here. - Hey, hey. The guy from Harlem. - Just like old times. How you doin'? - Fine. - You remember when we used to play football together? - Do I remember? I was quarterback, he caught the winning touchdown pass, he scored, I scored with the ladies. Sure, is that the game you're talkin' about? - That's the one, but that's not quite the story. It's cool, though. Tell me, what can I do for ya? - First, let me introduce my partner here, Paul Benson. - Paul, how you doin'? - My partner speaks pretty highly of ya. - Does he now? - Yeah. - Well, you know, Al, you're one of the greatest guys. I think you're a hell of a guy. - Same old bullshitter, too. That's quite alright though, why don't you guys have a seat? - Alrighty. - Why, thank you. - So, what lines of business brings you to Miami? Oh, still with the CIA, huh? - A person from an African nation will be meeting secretly with the Secretary of State. They arrived today, but he'll fly down tomorrow from Washington DC. - How come the meeting will be held in Miami instead of Washington? - Our client's life is in danger, and we're sure that foreign powers will be trying to prevent this meeting. - What I can't understand, Dave, is why the CIA doesn't supply the security. Why do they want me? Something just doesn't seem to fit, babe. - It's simple. It's very possible that there could be a leak in the CIA. Someplace, somewhere, but we're not taking any chances. - This person from an African nation, she's the wife of a Chief of State. And we're thinking that you'll check into a hotel as man and wife. Hands off, she's the wife of a Chief of State. - Hey, now that would take everybody off guard. But let me ask you a silly question. - Don't say it. We don't need an international crisis. You wanna know if she's cute. Yes. But remember, international repercussions. Yes, she's cute. - Hey, now how'd you guess that? - Al, remember the good old days? Hong Kong, Bangkok. Dirty old man. - Yeah, but gettin' back to business. Just how much do I get for this little number? - There's $2,000 in it for you. - Hey, that's great for 24 hour service. That's not bad. In fact, for that kind of dough, I don't care if the lady diplomat is 80 years old. - We have two agents at the airport now, picking up Mrs. Ashanti. We have precisely 30 minutes to get to the hotel lobby where she'll be. - Wait a minute, if I'm takin' this case, I have to pick the hotel. Have your agents drop her at the Towers. The desk clerk will tell her where my room is. I'll be waiting there. We'll be registered as a Mr. and Mrs. Connors. - That's a little irregular, but I guess we'll have to do it as you say. - Look if I'm gonna worry about the security of Mrs. Ashanti let me do it my way. The desk clerk at the Towers is a personal friend of mine, and he'll handle the situation for me. Gentlemen, I think I'd better get to the hotel and make the necessary arrangements, and I suggest you get in touch with your agents and tell them of the change of plans. - Good luck, Al. - Don't worry, this is gonna be an easy case. - I hope so! - If you run into problems, you can reach me at this number. - Okay. Cancel my appointments for the rest of the day. Okay. [knocks] Princess, my darling. It's been so long. You can leave those bags there, I'll take care of them. - Okay. Two dollars, thanks, thanks a lot. - I'm sorry about that little number, Mrs. Ashanti, but it was necessary for security purposes. You're supposed to be my wife, for 24 hours. My name is Al and we're registered as Mr. and Mrs. Al Connors. - Hey, wait a minute, you don't mean-- - Of course not, it's just for security purposes. In fact, the suite has two bedrooms. I'll be staying over here and you can take that one. I'm just your personal bodyguard, ma'am. - Hey, you know, I really feel miserable today. I'm in pain all over. Would you show me to my bedroom, please? - With pleasure, ma'am. Did you say you were not feeling well? - Yes! I'm in pain all over. You know, I had to stay on that plane for so long. You know, I really can use a good massage. - Okay, I'll call for a masseuse. - Good, then I'll change into something more comfortable. [Al whistles] - Hello, yes, I would appreciate it if you would send a masseuse to suite 304 for my wife. About five minutes? That's fine, thank you. [funk music] [lively funk music] [knocks] Who is it? - [Woman] Hotel masseuse. - Hold it. Just a minute, please. [knocks] Olivia, are you ready for the masseuse? She's here. - [Ashanti] Ready. [funk music] - What're you doing at the window? - Oh! I was just admiring the scenery. It is beautiful, isn't it? - Yes, I guess it is. She's ready, you can go in. - Okay. Hi, how are you? - Hi. I'm terrible. - Bad back, huh? - Oh, yes. It's terrible. You know, I really need this. My back is killin' me. [funk music] [moans] Oh, this really feels good. I feel much better already. [moans] [suspenseful percussion music] - How do you feel? - Oh, much better. - Good. - [Ashanti] You do good work. Al, what're you doin' in here? - Just admiring you. - Um, I really don't feel comfortable about men being in the area while I'm doing this, if you don't mind. - [Ashanti] Al, would you leave the room, please? - Sorry, ladies, but I enjoy watching. It's been a long time, you know? - [Ashanti] Alright, you peepin' tom, you may remain. [funk music] - So, do you feel much better now? - Yes, much better. - Good. Okay, have a good evening. Bye. - They charge your bill to my room, right? - Yes, the bill will be charged to your room. - Here. - Thank you. Bye bye. - Can't I have some privacy around here? - I had to do it for security purposes. I didn't know that you had such a-- - Beautiful body. - That's right. I can't believe they're paying me for this. Princess, you could never guess how happy I am to be here. - Yeah, I bet you are. - It's a good thing you don't bring your old man along on trips like these. - Hey, wait a minute, let's just leave my husband out of it. - [chuckles] I'm starved, how about you? How about some food? - As a matter of fact, I was just gettin' ready to ask you the same thing. Why don't we go down and get a bite to eat? - No, for security purposes, we have to eat here. - Oh, I've had it up to here with security. - It's not that bad. I'll call room service and get us something. Yeah, this is suite 304. We'd like to have two New York strip steaks, well done. Yeah, we'll have, um... Bring a bottle of scotch, J&B. Bein' the wife of a president must be a pretty interesting position. - Yeah, interesting for him, but boring for me. - Boring? - Yes, he's always gone out of town someplace. And there's nothing for me to do around the house. - A lady as lovely as you always something to do. - Yeah, like watchin' television all the time. - Oh, come on. - Read a newspaper about him. - You mean to say you don't have anything on the side? - I have to return to my country and back to my husband. - Then we don't have very much time, do we? - We certainly don't. - [chuckles] Well... - Hey, wait a minute. Just because I'm bored doesn't mean that I'm hot to trot. - Now, where does a foreigner pick an accent like that? And how'd you become the wife of a president? - Oh, that surprised me, but he's fantastic, but-- - A little boring? - Yes. - Yeah. - You have that. Tell me, where are you from? - [Al] Harlem. - Harlem? Oh, wow, I spent six month in Harlem. - Did you like it? - Oh, yeah, it's fantastic. - [Al] But there's too many detectives there. - Oh, is there? Well, I didn't notice. - [Al] You weren't looking. - [Ashanti] But all that experience in Harlem, I should be very lucky to have you for my bodyguard. - Baby, you don't know how lucky you are. Harlem is the experience playground for all people interested in becoming detectives. - Oh, really? [knocks] - That must be room service, I'll get the door. - Oh, I hope so, I'm starving. - So am I. You can put the tray over there. - Gee, I'm glad the food is here. - It's about time. [dramatic music] [Ashanti gasps] - Al, have you lost your mind, that's a woman! [gasps] How did you know that was a man? - Nobody fools with Al, baby. He didn't have steaks on his tray. I can smell a New York strip steak a block away. But the worst is yet to come. I'm sure he's got some buddies. Get in there fast and get on some clothes. [lively funk music] [goon groans] - Okay, okay, okay. - Who the hell is payin' you to do this? - It's none of your fuckin' business. [gun clicks] - Now, that was a blank that time. The next one is gonna go right through your throat. - I can't-- - Who's payin' you to do it? - I can't tell you, they'll kill me if they find out. - Okay, you got three seconds, and if you don't tell me, I'm gonna kill ya right now! - Alright, alright, alright. I work for Big Daddy. - You tell Big Daddy that nobody fools with the guy from Harlem, you dig? - Yeah, yeah. - Oh my god, Al, what happened? Where do we go now? - Don't worry about it, I'm taking you to a safer place. Let's get outta here. [telephone rings] [typewriter clacks] - Al Connors' office. No, I haven't heard from him, Mr. McLeod. Well, if Al's checked out the hotel, I'm sure he had good reason to. Well, listen, if you leave me your number, I'll have him call you when I hear from him. Is that 685-4932? Okay, don't worry, I'm sure he's alright. I'm sure everything's fine, okay? Okay, I'll have him call you, bye bye. [knocks] - Al! I thought you had forgotten me. - Oh, you know I never forget you, baby. - Who is she? - Oh, I'm sorry, let me introduce you to Mrs. Ashanti. Princess, this is Jo Ann. - How do you do? Okay, Al, what's the story? - I will explain everything. Princess, please excuse us for a moment. Jo Ann, come on into the bedroom. - Okay, buster, you better have a good explanation. - Look, detectives sometimes get weird assignments. - Keep talking, I'm listening. - I'm this lady's bodyguard, and I don't have a safe place to take her. There's some people trying to kill her. I can't take her to my place, or another hotel would be too risky. I figure your place is a safe place to be right now. - Okay, alright, you've convinced me, you can stay here. But how long are you going to hide this girl in my place? - Just for tonight. Look, baby, if you really dig me, just trust me. - Okay, I'll be ready in five minutes. - I knew I could count on you. [moody funk music] Why don't you spend the night in a hotel? - Okay. - Okay? - Sure. I'll be out in a minute. - Okay. [funk music] Princess. - [Ashanti] I hope I'm not being an inconvenience. - No, everything's been taken care of. - Well, it was a pleasure to meet you, princess, but I gotta warn you about this playboy detective. - I didn't know I had such a reputation. Thanks for the warning. - Well, bye for now. - Goodbye. - Are you comfortable? Feel free to make yourself at home here. - Thank you. This is a very nice place here. - Would you like something to drink? - Yeah, sounds like a great idea. Would you like for me to fix it? - Beautiful. - Just show me where the glasses are. - The bar is right over there. I better give David McLeod a call. David. Yeah, it's me. Look, we ran into a slight problem at the hotel, and I had to split for a safer place. Yeah, everything's cool, everything's alright, babe! Yeah, yeah, she's here with me. The meeting's at 10 o'clock tomorrow morning? You want me to drop her off? You're gonna pick her up, how about around 9:30? Nine o'clock? That's cool, yeah. Yeah, it's the penthouse apartments, suite 1502. Right, don't worry, everything's cool, man. I'll see you tomorrow morning. Okay. Right, right, right, okay, bye. Do you need any help? - No, I'm doing just fine. - [Al] Alright, I'll be right with ya. I gotta make another call. - Sure. [telephone rings] - Al Connors' office. - What's new, pussycat? - Al, I was worried about you. Your friend McLeod called. - Yeah, everything's under control, you can go home now. Yes, I'll be in tomorrow as usual. Okay, Sue, goodnight now. And remember, don't do anything I wouldn't do. - Sure, boss, that leaves me a lotta leeway. Oh, Al, I almost forgot, you had another call. A guy working for the CIA, he wanted your address. - Did you give it to him? - Yes, boss. Did I do the wrong thing? - No, that's alright. You did the right thing, it'll work out. - Okay, boss, but please be careful. - Okay, bye. - Bye. - Try this. - That's just what the doctor ordered. Your meeting with the Secretary of State is at 10 o'clock tomorrow morning. They'll be picking you up at around nine. You should be in pretty safe hands then. - But I feel as though I'm in safe hands now. - Oh, do ya now? Tell me. How does your body feel? Are you still having those aches and pains that were bothering you? - Oh, yes. My body still aches all over. Got any suggestions? - Well, you know, I used to be a masseuse once myself. - Oh, really? - Yeah. - Come on. - No, seriously. Tell you what, turn around here. Let me see what I can do for you. [Ashanti moans] How does this feel? - [moans] That feels good. Perhaps I should do you? - Oh? [both chuckle] - Mm, no wonder you got rid of those bad guys. You're so strong. - You know, there's a slight problem that I forgot to mention to you. - Oh, what kind of problem? - This apartment only has one bedroom. - Oh, that's no problem, we can share. - Ah. Beautiful. - But I haven't finished talkin' yet. - Oh? - I got it. You sleep on the floor and I'll take the bed. - Come on, you gotta be joking. That's not fair! - Okay, I was just joking. - Were you? Then let's not waste any time. I got an idea, come on. You know, I've carried these damn bags of yours so much, I'm beginnin' to feel like a bell boy. I'll just stick 'em in here for ya. - You know, Al, I've never met a guy like you before. - Well, you're quite an experience yourself, princess. - Well, I'm glad you think so. - Listen. Why don't you get out of those things? - Why so fast? - Why are you so slow? - In that case, I think I'd better change. - Change? [laughs] [sighs] [chuckles] Wow. What a change. - Faster than you are. - Yeah, you are. Now let's see who's the fastest. This isn't gonna work. [lively funk music] ♪ Check out the groove ♪ This cat is bad ♪ Get on down - Good morning, sweetheart. - Good morning, Casanova, you look tired. - I had quite a night, believe me. I don't think I'm taking any more babysitting jobs. - Oh, so your stuff turns out to be babysitting, huh? - No, really, I almost got my damn head blown off. As a matter of fact, babysitting can be a lot rougher than you'd think. Baby. [chuckles] - What's up for today, Al? - Nothing, I'm free. I think in about 15 minutes I'm splitting for the rest of the day. - The rest of the day? Al, it's only about 10 o'clock, what's going on? - Thank you for the time. Give me about 15 minutes and you'll find out. - Al. [typewriter clacks] - Good mornin', good lookin'! - Yeah, can I help you? - I don't know, I think you can. I came here to see Al Connors. - Can I have your name and the nature of your business? - Sweetie, I got an answer for both of those questions. You got two questions, I got one answer. None of your damn bidness. - Sir, you don't have to use that kind of language in here. Just a minute, I'll see if he's here. Al I think that goof-off day of yours is about to be ruined. - What the hell are you talkin' about? - There are three dudes out there that are demanding to see you. They wouldn't tell me who they are or what they wanted. - Hey, Dad. Do you think that dude will see us? - Think it? He better see us. - I have a hunch those guys are from Big Daddy's gang. - You want me to tell 'em you're not in? - Sue, I'm ready for those bums any time they wanna see me. If Big Daddy wants to get me, that game can be played two ways. Have those dudes come in. As a matter of fact, I'd better take a little safety. Have 'em come in. - Well, you're the boss. - Go ahead, go ahead. You gentlemen can go in. [man laughs] - Thanks, good lookin'. Thanks, baby. [snaps fingers] You wait here. And while you're waitin', take care of anything that needs taken care of. - Right on. How about a seat, baby? - Suit yourself. - Hello, my man! They call me and you probably heard of me. I'm Harry De Bauld. - How're you doin', Mr. De Bauld, I'm Al Connors. - It's my pleasure to meet ya, Al. I've heard a lot of good news about you. This is my son, Larry. - Larry. - What's happenin'. - Now, what can I do for you gentlemen? - Well, first, for starters, I suggest put the gun away. We're here to make a deal. We're not here to waste you, man. - Okay. Have a seat. - Thank you. I came here to see you in your office for two reasons. Two very important reasons to me and my happiness. One... It's kinda personal, but I came here, the reason why I came is because I know what you can do. You saved that African queen from being assassinated. - [Al] How the hell did you know about that? That's supposed to be top-secret. - Top-secret? [Larry chuckles] In my bidness out here in the street in this jungle, you is supposed to know everything that happen 24 hours a day, as a matter of fact, here's somethin' you should know. Big Daddy Gang, them hoodlums and my boys, have been fightin' for a long, long time over valuable property that brings in millions of dollars each and every day. - That sounds like a problem between the two of you. Not mine. - Just suppose, just suppose I got you involved with the problem, and offered you some serious money. I don't mean the type of money you make sittin' behind that desk, I mean some serious money. - Sorry, gentlemen, you've come to the wrong place. I don't deal with hoodlums. - Let's go, Dad. We don't need this chump. - Hold it, son, hold it. - Well, I can find my sister myself. - Sit down! - [Al] Sister? Did you say sister? - That's right, Al. I don't like to get sentimental, Al, but, he is talkin' about his sister who is my daughter. - Damn right. - My daughter, Wanda. Big Daddy's kidnapped her. - [Al] Well, if it's a case of kidnapping, that's another matter. I'd be interested in taking the case, but there's one thing. If you don't level with me, you're gonna pull me off the case. That's an automatic thing, you dig? - We understand that. - Okay. - Okay, Al. - What're you doin' when you get off tonight, baby? - Cookin'. - You and I have on the same color outfit. Why don't you and I go on down here to the disco tonight? You know? - And what we gonna do? - Dance, get together. Two beautiful people. - Where do you see one beautiful person. - Well, hey, baby. You know, life is beauty itself. And with you and I together, everything will be groovy. You see where I'm comin' from? - No. Get off my desk. - [sighs] Alright. Well, I've tried anyway. - Al, man to man. Man to man, if you take this case, baby, I'll pay you anything, you name a number and you got it. - Okay, so fill me in on the particulars. - I'm not gonna just fill you in with words, man. I'm gonna prove to you what I'm talkin' about. Lay the good stuff on him. You got $500,000 worth of stuff right there. And you got a quarter-million dollars in cash right there. Now, if that's not fillin' you in, I don't know what street you live on, baby. - I suppose you want me to make the delivery and pick your daughter up, right? - It all has to be done, Al, this afternoon. It's got to be done this afternoon, the exchange and the drop has to take place at the same time. - Okay, so where do I make the trade? - I don't know exactly, Al, but here's what I do know. You gotta go to the Bodybuilder Spa, it's on 163rd street and you meet a guy there by the name of Jim. - I know the place, but what I can't understand is why you want me to do the job. - Why don't somebody in my organization do the job? Do you realize, Al, that we're talkin' about life and death? Everybody's too upset. After all, man, you're talkin' about my daughter! - [Al] I'm gonna need a picture of her, I wouldn't wanna pick up the wrong chick. [Harry laughs] - I guess you're right about that. Here's the picture of my little wonder. - You'll find out that's she's quite beautiful. - Yeah, I guess she is. Incidentally, this little job is gonna cost ya 25 big ones. [Harry laughs] - You didn't say anything unusual, Al. Here's five Gs for a starter. It's all there, you don't have to count it. - [Al] I'll take your word for that, where do I take her? - Wanda, my daughter, will tell you that. - I've got the money, the coke, and a picture of your daughter. There's one more thing I need. - What is that, Al? - That's all the information you can give me on this Big Daddy fella, who is he? - When you say "who is he," you're talkin' about what he looks like and where he hangs out, nobody knows. Al, that's one thing we can't tell you much about. Very few people ever see Big Daddy. The only thing I can tell you, though, he's about six feet two inches tall, has blonde, curly hair, and man, you talkin' about some muscles, he got some muscles on him and he always wears bands around his muscles. That's the only thing we can tell ya about Big Daddy. Nobody ever sees him! - That's true, in fact, he has a reputation of never pulling any of his own stunts. He always send his cheap arms to do the dirty work. - Looks like I'm gonna have to pay this Big Daddy fella a little visit. I think I'd better get started. - Well, I love that, that's music in my ear. - By the way, how do I get in touch with you? - How do you get in touch with us? Don't you worry about that. We'll get in touch with you. - Okay. We'll see. - Yeah. - Positive. - Well, I was just hopin' that maybe-- - Alright, my man, alright, we gotta get outta here. Good lookin', you took care of bidness. Harry takes care of you. - Wait a minute. - Wait a minute? THat's money, honey. - Wait just a minute, you give this to him, so he can buy what he was lookin' for. [Larry laughs] - [Larry] What was you lookin' for, man? - What's the matter, little fox? Somethin' wrong? - What you think? - Hey, shut up, bitch. What's your problem? - I don't have any problems. I think you all have a problem. - Hey, eat shit. - Shit is what you-- - What's this fuzzy head of yours? - What the hell you think? What's that on your head? - I like this what I see. But I don't like that. - I'm glad you like it. Ain't black beautiful? - No, it looks like pubic hair. - That's okay, too, trash. - Eat shit. - You eat it your damn self. - Sit down, will ya? Just cool it. - All you honkies alike. - What's your problem? - I don't have a problem. Get your hand off of me. - Look, bitch. Look, you better listen. You better keep your damn mouth shut. Or something's gonna happen to ya and you might not like it. [moans] Oh, you're nice to squeeze. - Get your hands off of me! - Shut up. - Get your hands off of me. - Shut up. - Let me go! - Damn, it's almost one o'clock. I wonder where the hell Jim is. - I don't know. - Ah, he'll be here in a few minutes. It's awful quiet inside, what do you think Mac's doin'? Yeah, he's probably knockin' off a piece of that ass. - Off of me! - Hey, calm down, will ya? Hey, cool it, I'm not gonna bother you anymore. Just cool it. Let's talk about this. Look, I'll make ya a deal. You give me a little action and I'll let you go. How's that sound? - Hey, honky, I ain't no damn fool. I know you're not gonna let me go. See, I know what's goin' on. - Yeah, that damn Big Daddy would do me in if I did let you go. - Can I help you? - I'm lookin' for Jim. - Jim? You'll find him up in the sauna. You just cut up the stairs there and take a right. - Put it away. Take your hand off. I understand you're Jim. - [Jim] That's me, what do you want? - My name is Al, I think we can deal. - Deal? Deal what, nigga? - There's a certain chick I'm lookin' for. I've been told you have her. - [Jim] You wouldn't be talkin' about that little black bitch, Wanda? - Yeah, that's the one. - [Jim] You got the money and the merchandise, buddy? - I can get the money and the merchandise. I just have to know where to deliver it. - Well, there's a mailbox about a mile south by Highway 41, Old Cachoby Road. You be there today at four o'clock alone. Bring the money and be there on time. Oh, just remember, go alone. 'Cause you see, the girl, she may end up gettin' hurt. [chuckles] You know what I mean? - I'll be there, you make sure you got the chick.

She'll be alright after she cools off a little bit. - I'm sorry about the hassle, let's go to a hotel. - No, it's much safer here. Why don't you sit down and relax? What I can't understand is how your father got into drugs if he was doing so well in gambling, as you say. - Well, from what I heard, he was forced into the drug business. Yeah, I don't know what's goin' on. Dealers was gamblin', you know? He made his money, I don't know what's goin' on. I just wanted to leave. - Try that. That's just what I needed. - Well, how long do you want me out this time, Mr. Private Eye Creep? - It's just for tonight. Incidentally, I'm gonna leave a package here. I'll pick it up some other time. - Oh, I couldn't care less, pick it up when you want. - Baby, wait a minute, wait a minute. - I don't want that. - Here, here. Get yourself a hotel room and next time-- - There won't be a next time. - You and me. - Goodbye, nice knowing you, whoever you are. - Don't get mad! Tell me, did those guys harm you in any way? - No, they tried but they didn't get too far. - You look pretty tense, why don't you relax? Make yourself comfortable, you're safe here. - What I need is a nice shower. - A shower might do ya well. There's some clothes in the closet. Look through 'em, maybe something will fit you. I'm sure Jo Ann won't mind. - You're sure she wouldn't get mad? - She might bitch about it a little bit, but, she'll get over it, she's an alright chick. By the way, why don't you give your father and brother a ring before you take a shower and let 'em know you're okay because I'm sure they're worried about you. - Man, I don't wanna talk to them now. - Okay, give me the number, I'll call them while you're in. - The number is 377-3033. - 3033, okay, I got it. Cheer up, you're safe now. Yeah, let me speak with Mr. Harry De Bauld. Tell him it's Al Connors. Harry, yeah, it's me. She's fine. Yeah, but I can't bring her to you right now. No, no, nothing's wrong, she's fine, but I just can't bring her to you right now. She doesn't want to see you. Look... Harry, it's a long story, alright? I'll tell you what. Just be at my office tomorrow morning at 10. She'll be there, I'll have her there, right. Okay, okay, Harry, just be cool, okay? See you tomorrow morning, right, babe. [sighs] Whoa. Jo Ann never looked like that in that. [both chuckle] You know, I've been doing some thinking. I can't understand why your father got into the drug scene if he was doing so well in gambling, as you say. - Well, really, he was forced into the drug scene, because he, well, he wanted to be the biggest dude in town. - You're right, too many people OD on the hard stuff. - I promised my father that the first deal that he had with drugs that I would leave home. And do you know that two weeks ago he bought in a big shipment and that's when I decided to split. - Naturally, I'm assuming that that's the opportunity that Big Daddy needed to kidnap you. He doesn't want your father in the business. He doesn't need the competition at all. - I'll never go back home. - Look, I can understand how you feel, but I think you'd be a lot better off at home with them right now than you would be away. Besides, you may be the influence that they need to get out of this drug shit. - Yes, I know my father and brother need someone to talk to 'em, but right now, I'm just not in the mood. - Well, besides all that, I'm glad you came down here tonight but you must go back to them tomorrow. I've already spoken to your father and made arrangements for us to meet with them tomorrow morning in my office. I'm not just asking you to attend, you will be there. - Well, I promise I'll be there. But I'm not sure I'm goin' with 'em. - I understand where you're coming from. Look, I've got an idea. How about a little soft music? - Yeah. - A little dancing. Maybe a few more drinks and we'll just forget about this whole deal right now. - Dynamite. [soft R&B music] - How's that? - That's terrific. - I don't suppose I'll be needin' this against you, will I? - You might. [moody funk music] Are you in a hurry? - No. Let me try this. I undress myself faster than anyone else can. - Yeah? - Whoa. You mean I've been missin' this all this time? - Uh-huh. [Al chuckles] - I'm sorry, boss, but that guy, Al Connors, the detective, he's done another number on us again. He's got the girl, he's got the ransom, he's got everything. - And now you're gonna tell me this? Why didn't you tell me yesterday? - I couldn't help it, he left me tied up, and he killed off the guys I was workin' with. - This Al Connors is probably gonna try to split. I've got a plan. - No, Ma, I don't have the headache anymore. Well, you don't have to worry about me. You know I have my pills with me if I need 'em. Are you gonna cook the greens tonight? Oh, they're already on? I'll be home at five o'clock. I haven't had a good meal in a good while. Oh. Ma, I'm gonna have to go, my boss is here. - Good morning, Mama. Yeah, I'm back. Bye. How many times do I have to tell ya that this is a business phone? - Hi, Al. - I want you to meet Wanda De Bauld. Wanda, this is Sue. - Hi. - How you doin', Wanda? - Listen, Wanda's father, Harry De Bauld, and her brother, Larry, will be here at any moment now. I want you to have 'em come into my office as soon as they get in. - Are you talkin' about those guys that were here the other day? - Listen, I'm not asking for a commentary. - Hey, you have to excuse my father and brother. Sometime they just don't have good manners. - Well, there's reasons for everything, and I'm sure that they have one. Come on. - You have a very nice office. - Thank you. You know, you're really very pretty this morning. As a matter of fact, you really turn me on. - So do you. - One day, you're gonna make some man a very happy person. Can I hope that that person might be me? - You're gonna make a woman really happy. Say the word and it'll be me. [Harry clears his throat dramatically] - Wanda! [laughs] - My little sister! - Hello, baby! Oh, boy! [laughs] Al, you did a great job! He done and did a great job. - Listen I'm sorry to interrupt this little family reunion-- - Uh-huh, but man, you brought such happiness to the family! - Let me brief you on what happened. - Lay it on me. - I got your daughter back-- - Uh-huh. - But without givin' up the ransom. - Man, that's great. [laughs] Where's my money? - [Al] Hey, wait a minute, as far as you were concerned, the bread was being turned over to the Big Daddy Gang. - I can buy that you did your job and you did it well, but the main this is, where is my shit? - [Al] I can't give it to you, Harry. It's on the way to the police. - Nigga, is you crazy? You mean to tell me you give up all that shit... Man, you've got to be losin' your god damn mind! - Well, now I hope there's no objection-- - No objection, your black ass! Nobody, god damnit-- - Oh, Daddy, please don't. - [Harry] Alright, Wanda, alright. Alright, alright, maybe you're right. Maybe you're right, here's what you'll do. You'll get a check in the mail, air mail special delivery, first thing in the morning. - That's not necessary. - [Harry] Just what I promised you. - As of matter of fact, here's your first payment back. - If you wanna be Robin Hood, I'll take the money. But when I take the money, I'm gonna give you some advice, Al. I'm gonna give you some advice. You better look out, because Big Daddy gonna be dead on your case for your black ass. All I can say is-- - I know. - Thanks and good luck. - Uh-huh. - Come on, Wanda, let's go home. - Bye bye. - Alright now. I feel better. - Al, is there anything wrong? - No, everything's fine. But listen, I'm gonna have to close the office up for a few days, I want you to get a couple of boxes, for old files and take 'em home with you. - What's happening? - Nothing. Don't worry about it, just do what I tell ya, okay? - Alright, Al, but-- - Get the boxes. - Oh, okay. Al, is there anything wrong? I don't understand what's happening. - No, everything's fine. [telephone rings] - Al Connors' office. Just a minute, I'll see if he's in. There's a man on the phone who says he's Big Daddy, and you may as well face him now. Should I tell him you're out? - No, maybe he's right. Perhaps I should talk to him now, why should I run? Let me speak to him. Connors speaking. Yeah, I want to talk to you too, man. Be at the 79th street in Marina in one hour. But Big Daddy, this is between me and you, so come alone. - Al, I'm worried about you. - Don't worry, baby, everything's gonna be fine. But I've got to go right now. If anything should happen to me, destroy all my files. - But, Al... [telephone rings] Hello, Al Connors' office. Oh, Wanda, I'm so glad you called. Al got a call from someone calling themselves Big Daddy and he said something about meeting him at the 79th street Marina.

People don't turn down my offers, and live. - There's a first time for everything. - This ain't your first time, Connors. - [Al] Well, now I wouldn't be too sure about that. - I couldn't help it, Big Daddy-- - Shut the fuck up, Jim! - I didn't even know they-- - Shut up! - We found your peepin' tom in the bushes over there. - I suspected he had friends with him.
