The Daiei Company Presents: Old man... lend me an umbrella. Yes, sir. Here you go, sir! Thank you. Please come again.

What can I do for you? Sir... I must ask this of you... Please buy me for the night. Your elocution... leads me to believe you're from a samurai family. Do you wonder around propositioning men like this every night? No, sir... Tonight's the first time. Please, I beg you... Please buy me. All right. Please... this way. How's this? You lie down first. Yes, sir. Is that Noh Mask... ...to hide the shame of selling your body? Or to hide a face emaciated by an illness? Why don't you take the mask off? I've no intention of sleeping with a masked woman. - I'm leaving. - Please wait! What made you decide to sell yourself? You should know better, if you're from a samurai family. Explain yourself. I have no place I can call home... and I am all alone. Are you afflicted with an illness? Yes... I cannot possibly depend on charity... to make ends meet. Is that why you chose to sell yourself? Please wait, sir! Unlike men... as a last resort, women can sell their bodies. Are you going to just leave me? Please, lie with me! What I paid a gold piece for was your story. Your body is not worth that much. You were a woman of high rank, now you are without dignity. Laying with you will only torment me. It'd make me pitiful, like you! Sir! At least, tell me your name, please. Nemuri Kyoshiro... a rogue samurai. I hear she killed herself, slashed her own throat. The end of a woman who once served a samurai family. Say... did you know this poor, dead soul? I did. For her to end her life like that, she must've had bad karma. No, perhaps I'm the one who has bad karma... If that woman hadn't met me, this never would have happened! All too true! That's the kind of man you are! Say, you do recognize that, don't you? Remember Banzo the "Flying Squirrel?" You killed him. I'm his younger sister. And you want to avenge him? I know that you aren't a trivial match. Still... I will kill you for sure! Banzo lost his life while trying to kill me. I did not attack him. I don't care about your excuses. Sure... my brother was a mercenary... But, you know... ever since we were little... ...we were alone in this world, just the two of us. There's no way... a samurai like you can understand how I feel! Then attack me, as you wish. I'll follow you to the end! And at the first opportunity... you will draw your last breath! You say my name is in her will? Yes, sir... An express messenger delivered it to me this morning. I recall that she told me she was alone and had no home. Not true, sir... Five years ago, she brought this young man to my family. Subsequently, she disappeared, and we had no idea where she was. Was she his mother? No, sir... And yet... she was a mother to him. I see. I wonder, though... why did she mention me in her will? Sir... although she did not explain her reasons... ...she simply instructed that we should return this to you. Perhaps it was I... ...who caused her death... I cannot tell you exactly why... ...but this one little gold piece... ...crushed the last little bit of dignity in a woman of rank. I am a cynical man... ...and the harsh words that issued from my mouth... Who knew that they'd sap the last bit of strength? Regrets or repentance, it makes no difference now... Still, why couldn't I have given her any encouragement?! Dummy! Dummy! Sae, you dummy! You didn't have to die! He just said "Sae," didn't he? Yes, sir. She was a woman of rank, of a samurai family... ...yet you simple call her "Sae"... Are you the son of a samurai? No! I hate samurai! I can't stand samurai! For reasons I cannot reveal, his lineage must remain secret. Please keep this to yourself. I understand. If you say so, I won't ask. - Oito, let's go home. - Sure. Tsurumatsu is your name, yes? If there's anything I can do for you, name it. Why would I want to? You killed Sae! The Shogunate will soon be sending an inspector to Iwashiro fief. Is that true, Sir? If you don't catch Tsurumatsu and send him to your castle right away... ...you Clan, the Iwashiro, is doomed to extinction. I appreciate your attention to this matter, sir. And I thank you for dispatching spies to locate Tsurumatsu. I shall never forget your kindness. Yet, it won't come cheap, Kikumura. I understand, Sir. It'll inconvenience me a little as well, should the Iwashiro Clan vanish. That... is something that you, Elder Mizuno, and I, truly understand. And both of us would hate to see our incomes shrink. I suggest that you quickly grab Tsurumatsu from Masagoro the Carpenter. Lord Torii Norimasa has passed, and his heir, Kamechiyo, also died suddenly. Yet the public believes that within your castle, there still lives another heir. Should the inspector ever discover that... Tsurumatsu is missing from the Castle... ...undoubtedly that would be the end of the Clan. If that happens, even I can do nothing to save it. Indeed, the fate of Iwashiro's 120,000- koku fief hangs in the balance. Still, who could've guessed that he'd be hiding here in Edo?! The same Tsurumatsu that, 5 years ago, was but a nuisance to be eliminated. I don't know what to say, Sir... But now, the fact that Sae spirited away Tsurumatsu seems to be a blessing. It means the Iwashiro Clan is blessed with good luck. The Shogunate is plotting to wipe out all the Daimyo. Surely, you don't want to see that happen. No indeed, Sir. Wh... Who the hell are you guys?! I'm Monbe Saburota, of the Iwashiro Clan. I've come for Lord Tsurumatsu. I'm taking him with me. Tsurumatsu?! Wh... Why, that's my grandson. Masagoro, I've come for Lord Tsurumatsu, as he'll be the heir to the Iwashiro Clan. I already know... that Lord Kamechiyo died unexpectedly. - Masagoro, I beg you. - No! This is a matter of great import to the Iwashiro Clan! Return Lord Tsurumatsu to us. Please. My... How times change! This isn't a personal request. It is for the sake of our Clan! - Aren't you being grabby? - What?! Am I wrong? Didn't you try to kill the child as if he were a maggot? But now you want him back, for the good of your Clan! How insane! Vassals such as we know nothing of such matters. Bah! Just to save face, you pretend ignorance! Why you... Can't you see that I'm begging you?! You people argued over whether he was the son of a concubine or a real wife. You decided his mother was a concubine, and then you tried to kill him! Aren't you being selfish for wanting to take him back to your castle?! My daughter... no, the child's mother... You told everybody that she had sickened and died... But the truth is... maybe she was killed! As far as Tsurumatsu is concerned... ...he'll make all of you pay for what you did to his mother! You can put him back in your damned castle... ...but he won't find any happiness there! Silence! The mother served her purpose. No matter what it takes, Lord Tsurumatsu must come with us... for the sake of our Clan! - Such is your Greed! Enough! he's coming with me. - He's not downstairs either. - Gotten away, perhaps. All right. - Well? - Nowhere, sir. Alright! I'm not staying here! I'm going back! I'm going back to my Ojii-chan's! Ojii-chan: Grandfather (affectionate) You just sit there like that for awhile. - Do you hate me? - I hate you! Sae was a mother figure to you, and I'm the one... ...who causes her death, after all. When I grow up, I'll train until I'm strong, and kill you! What's so funny?! Well, I think that a samurai's blood boils inside you as well. You're crazy! I can't stand samurai! Let me go! Let me go! Oito would be very upset if I let you go. I gave her my word that I'd protect you, no matter what. I don't need you to protect me! Well, now, take it easy. You men... are you Iwashiro clansmen? - I am Monbe Saburota. - And I am Nemuri Kyoshiro. - I've heard everything. - We've come to collect Lord Tsurumatsu. It's remarkable that you found us here. Didn't I tell you I'd follow you until the end? So you're trying to defeat me by joining hands with these men? Serves you right! It might be too early to get so excited! You won't be handing him over to us? The future of our Clan is at stake! I won't let a petty ronin decide it for us! Wait! You'll hand him over then? I will. If... If... he wants to become a Daimyo... ...and wishes to return to the 120,000 koku fief of Iwashiro. - What? - Ask the kid for his answer! No way! why would I want to become a samurai?! I'm gonna become the best carpenter in Edo! There you have it. And that's my answer too. Do you realize... what will happen to you?! I do. But my bad karma brought an end... ...to the woman who protected this child. Thus I have... a responsibility to ensure his happiness in life. We need you to step aside! This dire matter concerns the future of the Iwashiro Clan! You've attempted to kill him once! Do you wish to maintain your peaceful lives... ...at the cost of crushing his dreams for happiness?! I've heard of your Full Moon Cut... and I'll live to tell of it! Follow me! Oh... Sir Kyoshiro... are you being followed or... - By a certain woman. - Oh! I threw her off the track on the way here. She'll be most vexed! - You're a sinful man! - It's not what you think. Who's this child? - I need you to hide him here. - What? Please! I'll run away! That's the kind of kid he is. Won't you please? I can't tell you all the reasons... But the one who made him miserable is me. Never have I... seen you look so sad, Sir. I bet this must be a very delicate matter. You can count on me, Sir! Thank you. Son, I don't know the whole story... but don't leave here. OK? OK, I'm asking this of you. Tsurumatsu... don't step outside of this inn, understand? - Thanks. I owe you alot. - That doesn't sound like you, Sir Kyoshiro! It's all right, Sir. You can trust me. Mister! Thank you. What's with that kid? Say... I hear that kid is some Daimyo's son. Orin, I believe your name is. You think you can defeat me without the help of the Iwashiro Clansmen? What are you talking about? I just want to see you getting shredded. You didn't have to get involved... yet you're sticking your nose in. This little mask is making me. Surely, you're joking. What's so important about a silly mask? This mask... is a testament to my twisted and profound karma. Damn right! Anybody who gets involved with you... ...whether man or woman... their lives all end in misery. Masagoro the Carpenter was... killed as well. What?! That too... is because of the profound crookedness of your soul! - Serves you right! - Orin! - And there's more. - The girl?! That's right. Want to know more? None of this would've happened if you had returned the kid without a fuss. You've no compassion! - Oh, is that so? - Tell me! Where's Oito?! I wonder... Probably in a living hell by now. What?! - Want me to tell you? - Where is she? Muen Temple... in Fuykagawa. Muen Temple?! You're gonna go save her?! I'll bet it's too late for that. By now, she'll have been sacrificed in a "Black Mass" or something. A Black Mass?! You know about the concubine, Fujie? I hear she had no idea she was pregnant! - How many months has it been? - 4 months, I hear. An abortion won't be easy, then. Elder Mizuno is a sharp fellow! As long as he knows the secrets of... the inner Court, he controls everything, and gets rich in the process! Those poor ladies-in-waiting, having to watch the Black Mass... Do you have any idea how starved for men they must be now?! Still, his partner-in-crime, Sir Kikumura, is a monster as well! Hey... wh... what is it...? You! Wh... Who're you?! Hey! Enough of this absurd celebration! Nemuri Kyoshiro! What?! Kyoshiro?! I deduced what this temple's purpose is. You must be Kikumura, the Iwashiro Clan's Chamberlain in Edo. So the secret of this temple, which you were hiding, is that... ...it does a thriving trade providing abortions to the ladies-in-waiting? And apparently the Shogunate turned a blind eye to it, I see. Ronin, your end is near! How appropriate it is, that this is where you die! I was going to say the same to you! You make me laugh! Kill him! Kill him! Kill him! Fallen Christian! With one hand, you were performing abortions... ...and the other, you presided over satanic torture and murder! You're but a damned dog on the loose... A dog that spits on your God's mercy! To hell with you! You men... ...were you just going to sit and watch a dying woman get raped?! Hear me, ronin. My people are already on their way to Tsurumatsu's hideout. - Orin! - Indeed. She informed us of his whereabouts. By now, my men will have captured him. Tsurumatsu lost his mother... and the Masagoro was killed... ...and now Oito has become your next victim. Are you going to install Tsurumatsu as your Lord... ...just to maintain your positions?! Say what you like, I control the 120,000 koku fief of Iwashiro. And, backing me is Elder Mizuno Tadanari! Pitiful ronin! Meet your fate! I'll get Tsurumatsu back, if it cost me my life! Kill him! Hang on! Serves you right! See, that's what happens to everyone who gets involved with you. Lord, that man Kyoshiro... he's left Edo. What?! Kyoshiro isn't your average foe. It will require extraordinary measures to defeat him. Say, my Lord... Even though we have the child, now that he knows the secret of Muen Temple... ...you don't want to leave him alive, do you? Well, as for myself, I've got my reasons why I don't want him alive. Monbe Saburota was the best man in our Edo garrison. Yet, he was defeated... And considering yesterday's events, we must take even greater care. Summon Akaishi Gunbei from the castle. I cannot think of anyone but Gunbei who could destroy Kyoshiro. Order him to destroy Kyoshiro on his way to the castle. - I will go and instruct him, Sir. - Use our horse-express! - Yes, sir. - My men will accompany you. I shall follow. Very well. Anzai.. warn Akaishi that this opponent is very dangerous! Yes, sir. We're not dealing with someone these men can defeat. Just watch... My men will avenge that brother of yours. You'd better! We've got the house of a Daimyo depending on us. If things go as planned, they'll do anything we ask. - There'll be money pouring in. - Yes, ma'am. Mister... aren't you disappointed that the girl you saved... ...turned out to be but a slattern? And your savior didn't turn out to be a young liege vassal either. I suppose a stray dog saw a cat drowning and saved it. Mister... I guess you're holding a grudge against this world as well. A grudge...? I'd think that anyone in your position... ...wouldn't be afraid of anything. And you are? Of course I'm afraid! Like today, a gang was after me... ...and they rolled me up, just as you found me! Covering for your man? Why can't women be more strong?! Where's your man? Oh, I wonder. I can talk about it, but I'm afraid it'll be a waste of time! Well, Mister... Won't you please let me stay here with you tonight? I'm still shaken by what happened today. I don't want to be alone... Otsuya... that's your name, you said? I have a good idea who asked you to do this. Forgive me for slicing up your beloved snakes! That's him... Nemuri Kyoshiro! Men... Do not interfere! Iwashiro clansmen? I am Akaishi Gunbei - the chief guards- man of the Iwashiro Clan of Shinano. I see you already know who I am. - What?! - Wait! I'm sure that your Chamberlain in Edo, Kikumura, ordered you to do this. I bet you don't know what a crook he is. Never mind the Honorable Chamberlain... My only concern is the survival of the Iwashiro Clan! Tell me your style. Uragasumi, Muhen-Style. Face my Full Moon Cut... some other time. Wait! Sir Akaishi! Why don't you kill him?! Patience! It appears he and I are evenly matched. Being equals... the victory will be achieved in a blink of the eye. Defeat would be an act of unspeakable disloyalty. Don't you agree? Listen... We'll be meeting with the woman Orin at a bar in Matsuida. There'll be men from Edo also. This enemy of ours won't run or hide. Why don't we settle on our tactics after the meeting. "BAR" So I haven't seen the snake girl since then. I'm so peeved, I don't know what to do! We're dealing with someone who slew Monbe with a single stroke. Not to mention wiping out all our men from Edo. Without a better strategy, we'll only sustain more casualties. - Strategy? - We've no choice. We must not let Nemuri Kyoshiro enter Iwashiro castle-town! Chamberlain Kikumura orders it, so it must be done! We must kill Kyoshiro, no matter what the cost! This Nemuri fellow... ...doesn't attack us, nor does he resort to cheap tricks. We don't have anyone tougher than him. Nemuri is like water... You can beat it with a stick, or throw pebbles at it... ...but it's a waste of time. But, this Nemuri Kyoshiro... surely he's only a man! We'll devise a trap. A trap? No, I can't abide that. This is no time to be fussy about the method to employ! I understand that Sir Akaishi wants to face him like a true samurai should. But, the word is that this Kyoshiro fellow... he's no average warrior! Yes, we must be loyal... but we don't want to throw our lives away. What a stubborn fellow! Say, sir Anzai... I brought someone with me... Will you see him? Who is he? - Gen? - Yes, ma'am. Take cover, everyone! Against that... nobody stands a chance! He learned the craft of explosives from the Europeans, you know. Still... how will you make Kyoshiro take hold of the candle? You may leave that to me. - Kid! - Lemme go! Lemme go! If you want it, tell me why! I am not angry at you, and I don't mind giving it to you. But it is wrong to take things without asking! Sentaro! What have you done?! I beg for your forgiveness, sir! Please punish me... in place of my brother! Sis, you dummy! You're crazy! You're that kids sister? Yes, sir. Your brother wanted this Inro? Inro: ornamental medicine wallet. No, sir... My father has become chronically ill... Buying medicine is a task we find difficult... ...with the means we have, sir... We can't do a thing. My brother wanted... the medicine in your Inro! I see. Pardon! So far so good! IWASHIRO 5 RI, 8 CHO (~12.5 MILES) I am sorry to bother you like this... Are you Sir Nemuri Kyoshiro? How do you know my name? Sir, the Noh mask that you bear... ...there is a person I know who is somewhat associated with it. This little mask? It once belonged to a girl named Sae. Perhaps you knew her? Yes, sir. And in that regard, I'd like to make a request of you. Would you mind coming with me? All right. Priestess Seikain, I have brought him. Very good. Are you... the one associated with this mask? No, sir. I am sorry to say... ...that I have absolutely nothing to do with that mask. I must apologize, sir... I thought that, without deceiving you... ...there would be no way to bring you to this cottage. Tell me why you did so. While traveling, the priestess who brought you here overheard... ...five men, who are looking for you, talking about you. It was she who told me about this. And...? And that you... have no equal in all of Edo in matters of the sword. I have long been in need of a strong, brave samurai. "In need," you say? Yes, sir... well... Strong and brave, eh? I'm a complete opposite: a roguish warrior. No... there's no one better then you, sir... And, what is it that you need me to do? I want you... to lay with me. Oh! And, what is it that makes you desire me in particular? I am... the last survivor of the Fuma Clan. The Fuma Clan? His Highness, Hidetada, the third Tokugawa Shogun... As his holy blood flows in the veins of the Fuma, we are therefore... ...the rightful heirs of the Tokugawa. Sounds like bull-shit to me. No, sir. One day, the Fuma shall rule the nation! Do what you want. It's got nothing to do with me. I beg you, sir. Please, take me... What have I done to... make you part with your chastity? I would like to... to bear your son... After all, the women of the Fuma Clan... ...are destined to bear strong boys. Hurry... Please hurry... Am I the first man... you ever slept with? Yes, sir... Sir Kyoshiro... Fine. When a woman offers a meal... a man must eat it. As I am but a nun... ...never have I felt the touch of a man. I need you to treat me gently... Orin! try throwing your shuriken at me! This woman's back will catch them nicely! I know how you two want to avenge Banzo... But all I did back then was defend myself! Damn you! What are you going to do to me?! I'm but the bastard son of an ex-Christian. And I am to lay with a Fuma clans woman?! Even if it was a made-up tale... talk about a wretched fate! Orin, give up. I don't want to kill you. - Why would I? - So I can't make you? Fine! As for how wretched my karma is, we'll let your body do the talking! Pardon me... - Oh! It's you. - Yes, sir... I sought you at that inn... ...to return this to you. Was it not dangerous, walking this road at night alone? But... my father told me to return this to you. Here you go, sir... Please thank your father for me. Pardon me... but, I am sure... ...that a lantern would be useful walking at night. The darkness is no stranger to me. But... All right. How can I decline such a kind offer? - What is the matter? - Nothing... Just... Please, sir, be careful... What's the story on Orin? There shouldn't be anything to worry about, sir. Take cover! Father... He will not touch his meals! If we release him, it will mean the end of our House. But... ...just look how young and adorable He is! Seeing him like this hurts me deeply! How can we imprison our Lord in a living Hell... ...just to ensure the survival of the Iwashiro Clan? How can this ever be an act of loyalty?! I hear that Chamberlain Kikumura ran into some trouble... ...but everything is in place at Iwashiro, even if the inspector visits us. Yet, this Kyoshiro fellow... he vanished after the explosion. It was a big explosion... he couldn't have survived. It's only one petty ronin! There's no need to be so alarmed. What's Akaishi Gunbei doing now? Sir... He is enraged, and vows not to return until he defeats Kyoshiro. What a fool! By the way, Anzai... about the girl, Orin... Sir, we have her waiting for us at an inn. We should take care of her soon... ...or she might cause us much bigger problems later on! I am aware of that, Sir. Y... You gotta be kidding me, Sir Anzai! What's going on here? Why am I here? Wasn't I supposed to meet the Chamberlain?! You know too many of our clans secrets. And so, I received a certain order from the Chamberlain! Damn you people... I won't let you crush me just like that! Kyoshiro! Ah... The woman is of no use to you now, I see... Imprudent fool! Do you think you can leave our lands alive?! I will return to Edo, and take Tsurumatsu back with me! You're crazy! How can you do that?! Tsurumastsu is inside the castle! It matters not where he is! Kill him! Kill the girl too! Hey... Hold on a second... Leave this town at once! Only after I see you die. This empty well leads to the Bodai-ji Temple. Ayaji... You must guard him... ...and convey Him outside the fief, far away. Yes, sir. What about you, Father? I'll be staying. - Why can't you escape with us? - Go... before anybody sees us! Go! Go! Hold tight! All right? Hold tight... and don't let go! Hear me? Don't die. Ojiichan! - Ayaji, hurry! - Yes! Please be careful! - Guard the Inner Moat! - Yes, sir! All right! Go! Over here! Ayaji! Hurry! What?! Tsurumatsu has escaped?! Yes, sir. A kid can't possibly know how to do something like that! Ayaji is nowhere to be found either, sir. - Ayaji?! - Correct, sir. And, where is Sezaemon? That old man must be behind it all, eh...? - Jinma! - Sir! - Reinforce the gate watch at once! - Yes, sir! We're looking for a woman and a child. Don't let them get away. Sir! Oh! Sir Jinma... that's a... A Shogunate Inspector! Inform the Honorable Chamberlain. Yes, sir! Under the Seal of the Shogunate, Sir Murase Tanobo, has arrived... ...to undertake an inspection. - Yes, sir. You've had a long trip. The castle guards seem agitated... Has there been a problem? No, sir... Just an investigation into a theft. - Please enter. - We shall pass. Things aren't looking very good. Well, I'm sure the Chamberlain will stall him for a while. But we've got to find the Lord in the meantime. Sir Akaishi! Sir Anzai and his men were slain in the Hachiban-Ura forest! What?! Who could've done it?! It had to be Nemuri Kyoshiro! Why, you are... - Do you recognize this mask?! - Lady Sae used to treasure it... You are...? Who are you? My name is Ayaji. Please take care of Lord Tsurumatsu... - Tsurumatsu?! - Yes... We've... We've... ...helped Him to escape from the castle... Where is Tsurumatsu now? W... Within the spire of Bodai-ji Temple... - Hey! - There he is! - Kyoshiro. - Sir Akaishi! - Kyoshiro's... - What?! Where is he?! Fellows... you take it from here. Looks like I was one step ahead of you. That Ayaji girl... Alas, she didn't know she was being followed. I dare you to draw that sword! Do it, and the kid's throat will be slashed at once! Orin, that child has done you no wrong! True enough. But, you know... ...some Iwashiro clansmen tried to kill me! And look at you... You came all the way from Edo to find him. If I wanted to, I can get back at you, those men and everybody else! You aren't capable of doing that. Underestimating me? Watch and see if I can do it or not! Kill me! Mister! Tsurumatsu... Ayaji died... She was slain... It's all because I said I was hungry! Stop crying, Tsurumatsu! It wasn't your fault. Orin... looks like we've gotten ourselves surrounded. What?! Let me handle this. Take Tsurumatsu with you, and leave! Don't worry about me! No! If you die, Mister... then I will too! You must escape! You must live on, without depending on others... ...and become the great carpenter you want to be! No! Mister! Kyoshiro! You can't escape now. Surrender! Shoot! Release it! Mister! No! You can't go! Mister! If you kill this man, I'll die too! Lord Tsurumatsu! Do you promise you won't kill him?! I promise, Sir. - Then untie him! - That, we cannot do, Sir. He will attack us... without a doubt. Then... do you swear you won't kill him?! You have my word, Sir... as long as you return to the castle. Mister... please forgive me. I'm... gonna go to the castle. Tsurumatsu... You've lost. Lord Tsurumatsu... Mister... I'll never forget you, Mister. I assume you gave him an empty promise. Of course. I can't be sure of victory until you're dead. You pitiful samurai, dependent on your nice stipends... Those days will soon be gone. Kill him! - Hey! Get out of here! - Don't let him escape! Hey! Stop! Stop! Mister! Go! Hey! This way! Tsurumatsu! Unsheathe the sword, and drop it! Hurry up! Tsurumatsu! Don't close your eyes! This is what it means to be a samurai... To kill each other! Withdraw! Withdraw! Stop this pointless fighting! Sir Murase Tanobo, the Official Inspector, dispatched me here. The clans plots have been exposed, and disturbing discoveries made. As such, both of the clan Chamberlain... ...will be ordered to commit seppuku! Withdraw! Are you the man... named Nemuri Kyoshiro? That is correct. Without an heir, this clan will most likely be abolished. Akaishi! For the dignity of the samurai... For destroying my clan... I will kill you! That will be my final act of loyalty. A samurai's dignity? Loyalty? How pathetic! They are what I've lived for. I will kill you no matter what it takes! Stop it, Akaishi! Old man, let me do this! We've no choice. Seems that you and I were bound by fate to end this way. As your last memory of this world... ...witness my Full Moon Cut! Sir Kyoshiro... ...I am a disloyal servant. I have lied to the Shogunate Inspector... ...telling him that Lord Tsurumatsu is an impostor... ...and that the real Lord passed away five years ago. Elder... The Shogunate would execute Tsurumatsu if they knew the truth. Wasn't that your reasoning? Ojiichan, I'm a carpenter's son! There's no need to change that! Sir Kyoshiro... ...I ask you, please take care of Lord Tsurumatsu! You have my word. It's hard for me to admit... but I've lost. Never look back Tsurumatsu. Always look straight ahead of you. Yup! THE END
