MAN OVER RADIO: This is Starflight control. We have 24 hours to liftoff and counting. BOWDISH: You're at 53,000, Josh. Speed coming up to Mach 2. JOSH: Everything checks out, Bowdish. A perfect ride. You're at 54,000. Ready? Fire the rockets. Okay. [RUMBLING] Level off! Level off! I've still got four seconds. No way. Level off! You're over shooting. [BEEPING] JOSH: Too much thrust! I can't reduce the angle of climb! Damn it, Bowdish! We've got a mismatch! Exactly the same thing happened to Cody! You know something? You ought to stop being a pilot and stick to plane design. Yeah. I don't know. I don't know, it's not right. The rockets... Yeah, the rockets have been more than right. On 34 test flights. If we could just get them on the ground computer control. Josh, Josh, you know how long that would take? A week! Less if we kick it hard. Hey, listen, genius, this thing flies tomorrow. Maybe it shouldn't. I really think you need some rest. You're wiped out. Seriously, go home and get some sleep. And stop worrying. Nancy! You remembered. I'm... I figured if I didn't come and get you, you'd never come home. I was...Just leaving. Good night, Elliot.Just leaving. Good night, Elliot. Good night, Nancy. Good night, Josh. We were testing the rockets again. I don't know. Q.T. ON PHONE: Hello?Q.T.? Yeah. Just thought you'd like to know that Josh Gilliam is still making postponement sounds. I'll handle Josh Gilliam. I'm sure you can, sir. WOMAN ON RADIO: First hypersonic transport plane, Starflight One, which will travel higher and faster than any airplane has ever flown. So, tonight, with wonder, the eyes of the world will be onStarflight One as it makes history by...[TURNS OFF RADIO] What's all this about Josh? You been talking to him again? No, Dad. I just know that Josh feels that we should postpone. Maybe we should listen to him. Josh Gilliam will have us improve Starflight to the point that it's the most improved aircraft that never got off the ground. You know what I had to promise Washington to get some tax breaks and financing? I know, Dad. Not to mention the Thornwell 20 million that's riding on the flight tonight. I just don't see the harm in a few weeks' delay. When are you going to grow up? I can just see those headlines now if we postpone. Well, say something, Martin! Say something! Fine, Dad. Starflight takes off tonight as scheduled. Fine. MAN ON RADIO: Starflight control. Everything going smoothly as we move toward liftoff in 12 hours and counting. There is no such thing as an ungodly hour today, Felix. Today's the big day. I just wanted to see if you needed any more information before you went on the air. FELIX ON PHONE: Such as, my dear? Such as, the passenger list is made up of people from all across the country, demographically chosen. Shall I spell that for you? That's really marvelous. Half a Noah's Ark with one of everything. Speeding through the air 23 miles above the Earth at 4,000 miles an hour. [SCOFFS] I wonder what Noah would think. Felix, what can I do to get you to give Starflight an even break? If that's a proposition, I accept. I'll bet you do! You've been accepting it for years in your dreams. [CHUCKLES] And what dreams. Whoo! All right, the least I'll accept is a drink before we take off. Okay. It's a deal. Bye. Good morning, sunshine. Mmm. Looks lovely. Everything's cold. I'm sorry. But I had to make that call. It's very important. You don't talk to Daddy like that. Lori, your daddy and I are divorced, and it breaks my heart that it still upsets you. We love you very much. I've heard how you talk to him. Felix? Come on! Felix and I joke around. You've heard us for years. That's how I deal with people. It's part of my job. Part of your job? Aren't we supposed to be having fun? Mmm? We're going to Australia. A couple of kangaroos, huh? [LAUGHING] [CHUCKLES] That's my girl. Better pack. Why? We're not going till 7:00 o'clock tonight. I wouldn't want you to be late and mess up your whole job. Fasten your seatbelts, folks. It's gonna be a bumpy ride. MAN ON RADIO: We have nine hours and 30 minutes to liftoff and counting. [WHISTLING] Well, how is it? Janet, what ever happened to your thing for omelets? What ever happened to cotton candy? What ever happened to us? Is it so bad? Nice house, out of the smog. And a husband who spends all of his time in the sky even when he's here. What do you think about when you're up there, Cody? Oh, I don't know. Wars I've been in, Presidents I've flown, people I love. Do I fit in that last category, Cody? Not today, Janet, please. Yes, but tonight... Tonight you're Superman, flying all the way to Australia in two hours. I haven't meant to hurt you. Well, you have. How? By tiptoeing around me like you think I'm going to break into 1,000 pieces if you just tell me what you're feeling. I don't... I don't know what I'm feeling. MAN ON RADIO: Six hours and 30 minutes to liftoff and counting. What? Yeah. It's me Freddie. Surprise, huh? Guess what? I'm going to be in Sydney for the launch. That's right, old chum. I'm on Starflight. I'll be in Australia a good two hours before you launch the satellite out there. How's everything at your end? Hey, pretty good, mate. Listen, everything looks pretty good down here. Some small delays, but safety check's starting in about an hour. We get that communications satellite up there, and the sky's the limit. I've already got bids on two-thirds of the telecommunications pods. More to come. Hey listen, Freddie. What's this I hear about the Chinese? Well, they've got a right to talk to the world too, don't they? What are they gonna do? Beam down fortune cookies? [LAUGHS] [LAUGHING] Nope, I don't know which is the bigger news event, Starflight, or Freddie Baron, Incorporated. Am I crazy? Not so I noticed. I'm a scientist. I'm supposed to deal in specifics, and I'm being spooked by a feeling. The rockets again? The rockets again. Josh, you told me that the only one who could handle them was Cody Briggs. [SIGHING] He's the best there is, but he is no match for a computer. Now, am I being difficult? No, you're being Josh. I mean, the computers don't show any no-nos. The tests were fine. Everything was... You look wonderful! You ought to sleep in a gray suit. [SIGHS] THORNWELL: Hello, Doppler. Good day to you, Mr. Thornwell. Mr. Bowdish said to tell you he's waiting for you. Thank you.And congratulations, sir. To all of us. Elliot, is there anything to Josh's fuss about postponement? Oh, no, it's... It's too remote. You'd better show me. Starflightis an airplane. It's not a spaceship. It was designed to operate in a gravity field. Take a look at this. See, before the booster rockets are cut off, that thing is moving at better than half a mile a second straight out towards space. What Josh is worried about is a possibility of a slip that could lift Starflightright out of the atmosphere. And you and I know that can't happen. Yeah, but supposing it does, what does that do in terms of cabin pressure? Well, you'd have a pressurized craft pushing against the nothingness of a zero atmosphere. So, if there's any structural flaw... [BEEPING] MAN OVER PA: Starflight One is two hours from liftoff and counting. WOMAN OVER PA: Other cabins have been outfitted for the news teams that have formed an international crew to cover this event. Starflight is operated through a complicated network of computer banks. It took two years to program the software for these computers. Your father would like you on his far right. So, what's new? [CHUCKLES] Josh! Come on. You almost missed your own flight. [CHUCKLES] Mr. Thornwell.That's right. Okay, shake hands again. Very nice. I understand you're having a few... Well, we won't call them troubles, but some qualms. Well, uh... Josh, you give me one shred of evidence that this magnificent plane of yours is not ready to take off, and I'll cancel the flight. Smile, Josh. I would prefer it if the rockets were under ground control, yes. But she is ready for her maiden flight, isn't she? Well, uh... Now, will the two Mr. Thornwells, come with me? What if he would've said no flight? Then Mr. Joshua Gilliam would have missed the plane. Excuse me just a moment, I'll be right back. Joe! Dad, you remember Joe Pedowski. Headed up our electric systems? Oh, yes, of course, you won the employees drawing, didn't you? Yes, sir. My first flight ever. Twenty years in aircraft and I'm still afraid of going up in a plane. [LAUGHING]Happens all the time. Hmm, ferocious Felix? What happened to our assignation? Well, I'm afraid it's going to have to be on board. Well, that's not very cozy. Well, the rumors I've been hearing are true. My lips are sealed. She's beautiful. Erica Hansen. Yes, she is. [SIGHS] I really don't care much for beautiful women. She looks nice, though. Is she? I thought so. WOMAN OVER PA: Starflight One is the first hypersonic transport plane to be launched into service. The first aircraft... You don't seem very excited, Hal. I mean, this flight's going to make history, and we're on it. Marrying you, sweetheart, makes even Starflight take a back seat. Honeymooning in Australia. And I've never even been to the San Diego Zoo! You know they have koala bears there? You know, I could really get to love you? Wasn't that Mrs. Briggs we saw with Captain Briggs? So, that's what's bugging you, huh? Well, was it? Yes. It was Mrs. Briggs. And yes, I like Cody. And no. You don't have any right to stand in judgment of me. And I want you to stop it. Right now. MAN OVER PA: One hour and 15 minutes to liftoff and counting. [SPEAKING FRENCH] Oh, thank you. Miss, could you do something about my shaving kit? Surely.Thank you. May I use the telephone, please? May I get that for you? [LAUGHS] Do you know that I'm the one who called you in Baton Rouge? You have a dry good store, right, Mrs. Harvey? Yes, and a small newspaper, The Christian Reporter, it's a weekly. Is that real? Oh, of course not. It's a fabulous fake. Oh. My daughter, Lori. Mrs. Harvey. Well, hello.Hello. And if you get cold, the purple shawl's in that bag. Okay? Bye. You must be very proud of your mother. Thornwell ground, this is Starflight One. We are ready for a preflight check. Hey, Josh.Hi. This is ground. That's a negative, Captain. We're about to go on hold. [OVER PA] We're at 16 minutes from liftoff and holding. There'll be an hour delay. Two passengers coming on board. The Australian Ambassador and his wife. Wait a minute. Didn't I read that he just died yesterday? Affirmative. We're shipping him back home. Special request from the White House, no less. Out. If you gentlemen will excuse me. I'm going to buy myself a drink. Sorry you can't join me.Yeah. Ladies and gentlemen, this is Captain Briggs. [OVER PA] Just to show you that hypersonic aviation isn't all that different, we've got ourselves a delay. The White House has requested that we take on one more passenger, who'll be here in about one hour. Sorry for the delay. We hope we won't inconvenience you any longer than that. WOMAN OVER PA: Ladies and gentlemen, we're sorry for the inconvenience. The flight attendants will be bringing the drink carts around to make the hour fly by. [CLEARS THROAT] Bud? [LAUGHING] It's Freddie. We've got about an hour delay here. Weather's closing in anyway, mate, so no sweat about your delay. Couldn't get the rocket off today anyway. Maybe not for another week. A week! Come on, we'll lose everything. What's the weather like now? Well, it's still pretty good, but our launch permit is three hours from now after Starflight'sdown. That's straight from NASA, Freddie. And the Aussies have honored the request. I've told you that we've got money out there, but we don't collect anything unless we can prove that we can get this thing off the ground. On time. Well, you can talk them around, Freddie boy, you're good at that. That's bull... I want the rocket in the air. Now! Well, what about the permission? I'll take care of that. You just get the rocket off. Well, I'll see what I can do. That's not good enough! Do it, Bud. Launch it! Now. All right, mate. Hi. Hi. Would you like some more coffee? You still plan on going back when we land? Lori's got school. Ah. It's pretty tough, isn't t? I mean, we're not... We're not even a triangle. What are we, we're a quadrangle? Four of us. I can't cut down my team. She's a lot taller than I thought. She thought you were very beautiful. That's very kind of her. Excuse me. Can I... MAN OVER PA: Delta launch, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one. [RUMBLING] MAN OVER PA: Starflight One on hold. One hour and 15 minutes, and still holding. I'm very sorry about your husband, Mrs. Winfield. Thank you. We're just waiting for another take off clearance from NASA. It shouldn't be too long. [TELEPHONE RINGING] Bowdish here. MAN ON PHONE: Ground control. All systems go forStarflight. Thank you. We're go. Wake up, Starflight. [OVER RADIO] You're clear for takeoff. Okay, gentlemen, let's do it. Hey, Chief's going fishing. [LAUGHS] Wouldn't take off without my lucky hat. Ladies and gentlemen, Starflight Oneis cleared for takeoff. DEL: 80 knots. 10,000 feet. 140 knots. 8,000 feet. 160 knots. Rotate. Ignite rockets. Congratulations, Josh. Positive rate of climb established. Good job. Read it out, Del. DEL: 79,000. Mach 2.3. 80,000. Mach 2.4. We've got you coming up to Mach 3, Cody. The announce tape rolls then. CODY OVER PA: Ladies and gentlemen, we've just passed Mach 3. Which means we're climbing now at three times the speed of sound. If some of you are thinking I ought to be minding the store and not yakking with you, you're right and I am. This is a taped message... FELIX: Jean-Pierre.Yeah, Felix. [SPEAKING FRENCH] [CHUCKLES] What did he say? He said he hopes luck has nothing to do with it. [LAUGHING][SPEAKING FRENCH] CODY OVER PA: We'll be traveling at that speed for one hour and 50 minutes whenStarflight One will touch down across the world in Sydney, Australia. [DINGS] That's all there is to it, ladies and gentlemen. Millie and Andrea will be coming around to see if you are thirsty or hungry, but I suggest that you imbibe quickly because you'll soon be overrun by news people sending back taped and live reports not only to the United States and Australia...Good luck. ...but just about every other country in the world. This should help. You may have to bring the whole bottle. [LAUGHS] You, too, huh? Nope, airplanes don't bother me. Chris, wait up. There's been a Delta launch from Australia. Angle of ascent, 45 degrees. Any problems? We're still tracking. But it could come close to the HST's flight plan. [CHATTERING] We're tracking a Delta launch that didn't clear with us. She's moving in an arc that's characteristic of a second stage malfunction. Now, if she malfunctions there's no telling what course she'll take. Where's the feed? From NASA. Some kook's got a Delta rocket moving toward us. Starflightto ground. BOWDISH OVER RADIO: Go ahead, Cody. We'd like permission to let NASA take us through this. That's affirmative, Cody. Okay, NASA, we're all yours. We're watching you like a hawk, Starflight. Now, when we took off... Here's Los Angeles. It may have felt to you as if we were going straight up. Well, we were. Just like a missile. And that's because this craft is powered by rockets. We use that rocket power to attain an altitude of 100,000 feet. At which point, we were going at a speed of approximately four... Mach 4. That's about 2,500 miles per hour. There's gotta be something you can do. There's not a bloody thing I can do. The automatic sequence control didn't complete. The third stage rockets aren't firing, mate! But you've got to give it every chance. Don't let them blow it. Don't. Please. BUD: Safety ground command is turning purple. Bud, don't let them destruct it. Look, mate, we don't have a bloody third stage! Bud, you destruct it, and I'm going to lose everything. I mean, everything. We don't have any choice, Freddie. You've got to stop them somehow, stop 'em. BUD: Destruct the rocket. [EXPLOSION] She's gone. Yeah, well, their timing stinks. Starflight, the missile's been destroyed. CODY OVER RADIO: What does that mean for us? A million pieces of space junk headed towards you at 8,000 miles an hour. How close? At your speed, everything's close. I'm out of my element, Chris. What's my move? CHRIS: We can't pin the debris. Not sure you can manage lateral traffic avoidance. Give me my move, Chris. Starflight, pull up and climb at your best rate. That means the rockets. ...in preparation for landing in Sydney. [OVER PA] Ladies and gentlemen, this is Captain Briggs. Please return to your seats immediately and fasten your seat belts. It couldn't be weather at this altitude, could it? All right, Del, hit it. CODY OVER RADIO: We're at 145,000. You should be over debris in five seconds. Joe?Hmm? What's going on, man? I don't know. CHRIS OVER RADIO: Stand by to level off and return to 120,000. Standing by. Okay, Starflight, level off. Standby to leveled off, kill rockets. Rockets are still burning. [BEEPING] We must've taken a hit. Rocket control wiring. CODY OVER RADIO: Thornwell ground, this isStarflight One. We think we've taken a hit. We've lost all controls to rocket thrust. We cannot kill the burn, over. Cody, we've got you at 160,000 and climbing. Over. CODY: How long until the rockets burn out on their own? Two minutes and four seconds. We're an airplane, not a space ship. You know where that'll push us? Yeah. Straight up through the atmospheric lid. 450,000 feet into space. Kill the burn, Cody. Kill the burn. 340,000 and climbing. Bowdish, this is Starflight. How much time to burnout? Twenty-four seconds. When do they hit space? 450,000 feet. CODY: 380,000. 390,000. DEL: 431,000. How long to bum out? Fifteen seconds. Me might make it. 435,000. [RUMBLING] 441,000. How much time, Bowdish? Seven seconds. 443,000. Four, three... 446,000. BOWDISH: One. Burnout. We're in orbit. Eighty-seven miles up. End of ride. Ladies and gentlemen, this is your captain. We are not in any immediate danger. We are all weightless, so until we get some more information, please stay in your seats with belts fastened. Kind of get everything loose fastened down, we'll appreciate it. Thank you. Will Josh Gilliam and Erica Hansen please come to the flight deck? You all right? Yeah.Let's go. Grab on. [BEEPING] CODY: Thornwell ground, this isStarflight One. We have made a preliminary check. There are no injuries. Fifty-nine of us are alive and well, waiting for your instructions. Where the hell did everybody go? Cody, this is Bowdish. You realize that, uh, that plane was not designed to go into orbit. So, we don't have that information in the computer and we're going to need some think time. [OVER RADIO] Briggs, Chris Lucas at NASA. First directive calls for you to save electrical power. No hot coffee, no microwave... And pull the transmission plug to that news bay of yours. Does that get us home? We've got a preliminary that gives you 50 hours before your orbit degenerates. And then things heat up. How's our air? This is Schultie, Cody. We should have a fix on that for you in a few minutes. Cody, you better check the skin on that ship. Pressure looks normal in all areas. Briggs, we'll be tracking you around the world. They're talking, but they're not saying much. Starflightout. Let me see what I can come up with. Cody, could you talk to them about the weightlessness again? If you keep them informed, they may not panic. I better get out there. Right. Ladies and gentlemen, this is Captain Briggs again. I repeat, we are in no immediate danger. The aircraft has not been significantly damaged. The pressure in all the cabins is completely normal. Thornwell ground control and NASA are already initiating procedures that will get us back on course. We're assured of NASA's complete cooperation. [ELECTRICITY CRACKLING] In the meantime, if you'd kind of get everything loose fastened down we'd appreciate it. Thank you. This is for the news bay. In order to save battery power we're suspending live transmission facilities to Earth. Well, they pulled the plug, but that doesn't stop us using our battery pack. Why don't you guys set up over in there? CAMERAMAN: Godspeed, boss. This is Felix Duncan aboard Starflight One. In orbit, in a weightless environment, aboard a ship that was not designed for space flight. We are circling the Earth once every 90 minutes. For all intents and purposes, this is an aircraft that has already crashed. Well, they've got at least 48 hours before an uncontrolled reentry. What have they got on the outside? Sixty. Sixty. They have 60 hours of oxygen left? That's borderline. Borderline? What are you saying? I'm saying it's borderline. There's not enough oxygen for that many people for that long a period of time. Do I have to spell it out for you? The only way we're going to get that thing down here is to reactivate the booster rockets. But the controls are locked. All the fuel was used up on the burn. I know that. And Chris Lucas of NASA is doing a feasibility study on having the space shuttle Columbia replenish the fuel. She's going to need a heat shield to reenter the atmosphere. I'm working on that, okay? Excuse me. Refuel the rockets? Lucas, you're crazier than I am! What have you got, a tank full of liquid hydrogen stashed up here? CHRIS: It's Columbia, Briggs. She'll be making the delivery. Her crew will refill your tank with the liquid hydrogen. We're getting ready to the send the space shuttle Columbia up to you right now. Our best team is at Canaveral. It's chief honcho is Captain Kenny Herrera. He'll pilot the ship. Thank God we've learned how to get them up fast. Liftoff will be in two hours. Give it a shot. Del, check the cargo bays, see that everything is still secured. We're orbit plus 45. We've just gone halfway around the world. [DOOR OPENS] DEL: I've finished the inspection. We have a damaged strut in B cargo hold. Seal's going. If we close her off, we lose that much air. B cargo? That's at least 10%. We lose four or five hours. Even if Columbia does find us, how do we get back? Without a heat shield... We don't. [ROCKET LIFTOFF] We got liftoff. Columbia's on its way up to you,Starflight. Columbia to Houston. We have target in sight. [CHUCKLES] Is that ever beautiful. Oh, boy! Shall we do it? LINDA OVER RADIO: Ready to refuel them. Starflight, when we're ready to feed, you release the number three fuel hatch. We copy. Captain Briggs, I'm ready to feed. That's affirmative. LINDA: Ready, Captain Herrera. Start pumping. Fueling completed, Captain Briggs. Closing hatch. Returning to Columbia. Could you take a look at our rocket bay? We may have sustained some damage. [CRACKLING] LINDA: Captain Briggs, you were right. Your external rocket system's control line is split. How long to make the splices? Sir, this is a maze I'm looking at. I'll consult with Captain Herrera. For now, I'd cut the power feed to this line, Captain Briggs. We copy. If we could find another configuration, a different angle to reduce friction to a minimum, we just might be able to affect reentry. I mean, she'd heat up, but she might come through. Then figure it out. [SIGHS] Well, we can't. What about NASA? NASA would need the performance characteristics of the design and they're just not in the computer. You see, we ordered Josh not to put them in the computer. Internal security. I mean, we've never had a conventional aircraft in a reentry mode before. 90% of this maneuver depends on the instincts of the person who designed the system, and that's Josh. Columbia carries an airlock. They could get him and bring him back. It seems ironic, you two planning a way to bring Josh home when if you had just listened to him in the first place. Cody, we think we can jury-rig our airlock to fit over your sectioned-off equipment compartment. There'll be spacesuits inside. We'll be bringing the airlock over to pick up Josh Gilliam at NASA's request. We copy. I guess we better make sure it works before we risk Josh Gilliam. I'm the only one here who wrote on his school application that he wanted to be an astronaut. Oh, listen, Pete...Case closed! Captain, you better speak to Josh. All right, Pete. [CLANKING] Cody, we're here. All right, I'll patch you over to Ray. [ON PHONE] Pete, this is Ray Barstow. The guy in a funny white suit. You hear me okay? Affirmative. On voice cue you'll open your compartment hatch, enter the airlock, then you close Starflight's hatch. LINDA: Ready, Pete? PETE: Yeah. Sorry, all the great space walk lines have already been used. See you soon. All right, I'll secure the compartment. Have a good trip. I'll catch the next one. Piece of cake. LINDA: Open the compartment hatch. [BEEPING] I'm in the airlock about to suit up. RAY: Get the suit and helmet on as quick as possible, Pete. Let us know when you've got the suit on. PETE: I'm going as fast as I can. Your funny white suit's all right. I always wanted one. RAY: Yup, it goes with anything. Make sure you shut the airlock hatch, Pete. [RATTLING] RAY: Pete, is your hatch shut? [RATTLING] [SCREAMING] Pete, I'm so sorry. No more guinea pigs. There's got to be another way to get you off. All right, but this time it's just me. No more guinea pigs. Our transmission frequencies are being monitored. The whole world knows about Pete. I think you have to let people see that we're still all right. Return power to press bay. [CRACKLING] Starflighthas about 39 hours of oxygen left, unless their orbit breaks down and they reenter before then. Damned if I can figure this out. Josh is the guy to get everyone down. We got to figure a way to get him down. Schultie, give me a reading on that oxygen clock, will you? Thirty-six hours, 14 minutes. REPORTER: We've got the pilot's wife. That's Janet Briggs, grab your gear. Have you been in contact with your husband? No, I haven't. I'm sorry. When did you first hear about the disaster? Excuse me, I have got to... Do you have any children? I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm Janet Briggs, can you let me through?How does it feel to have a world famous husband in orbit?Please? This information will only help you to tell the public. [REPORTERS CLAMORING]Please, I can't see with that light. Will you please let me through? How are you? I'm okay. I appreciate you, you know. Always did. It just seems easier to tell you now. Janet showed up at ground control. I would've expected that. Didn't you? I guess. Every 45 minutes. Turn the lights on, turn 'em off.[SWITCH CLICKING] It's the only entertainment on this $50 million flying coffin. This is not our coffin. We are going to get back. Cody? Won't we? Lucas, Cody here. Yeah, Cody. Chris, if some kind of air tight container could be rigged inside the luggage bay, could it be used to transfer someone? That's affirmative, Briggs. What are you thinking? Erica, tell Josh to pack his toothbrush. He's going home. Yes, sir. Look, here's how maybe it can go down, okay? The luggage compartment is sealed off from the rest of the ship. We load Josh into the casket, and the two astronauts open the compartment and pull Josh to Columbia. Wouldn't he need oxygen? The whole operation will take four to five minutes. There's enough oxygen in there to sustain him. Let's suppose that thing isn't really airtight. At best, all Josh would have would be a few cubic feet of air and what's left in his own lungs. Martin's got a point. Even a hairline fracture or a pinhole. Look, I think Josh knows the risks better than we do. CHRIS OVER RADIO: Houston to Columbia. You still there, Kenny? What do you need, Chris? We might put you down at Thornwell in California. Any problems? Is that launch facility of theirs operational? Affirmative. Okay, as long as we have our own ground crew. Can you handle the Ambassador's wife? There's no other way? Look, we ran out of moral niceties when those rockets wouldn't turn off. If you don't believe me, go ask your passengers how they feel about swapping a dead man for a chance to get out of here alive. We don't have time to think of another way, we just don't. I'll talk to Mrs. Winfield. Good girl. Cody. Yeah, Cody here. Linda and Ray are starting across to you. They'll open the luggage bay hatch and take delivery of the casket with Josh in it. When you give me the word. That's a roger. We're still losing pressure. I can't figure out where. What about B cargo hold? [SOBBING] It's not right. Oh, please. It's not right. There's no other way. [SOBBING] CODY: You'll get your tush frozen out there. Not exactly my idea of first class transportation, no. Help! Help! [WHOOSHING] About four minutes' worth of air in here. Shouldn't take longer than that. You could hold your breath for another three, if you're in shape. I'm not. LINDA: We're at the luggage bay hatch. Ready to take the casket. Check the seal. [SIGHS] No light leaks. Hermetically sealed. I don't suppose they've ever had a consumer complaint. Let's go. There's a hole the size of my fist. I didn't have a choice, Cody. I sealed off the entire cargo hold. You did right. Depressurize the luggage bay. Now we lose the air in the luggage compartment. Starflighthere. Starflight. You ready? My copilot's decompressing the luggage compartment now. In 30 seconds, we'll open the hatch. Josh is halfway to Columbia now. [HISSING SOUND][GASPS] [GASPING FOR BREATH] Are you all right? There was a leak. What did you do? [LAUGHS] Remember the story of the little Dutch boy and the dike? [CRACKLING] SCHULTIE OVER RADIO: We're figuring how much air you lost. Look, Schultie, we got two compartments sealed off. Now, that means lost air which means lost time. I want... There must be millions. Yup. All of it wouldn't buy us out of this mess. Starflight, this is Bowdish at control. Over. CODY OVER RADIO: Go ahead, Bowdish. We calculate you've lost about nine hours of your air supply. Over. Roger, Bowdish. Out. You'd better reset that clock. They've got 17 hours, and eight minutes of oxygen left. Well, if Josh doesn't come up with a miracle, we can take our pick. Suffocate or burn up on reentry. Thanks. MAN OVER PA: That's touchdown for Columbia. Back from rendezvous with Starflight One in space. What about reentry? We're projecting 21 hours. Well, I guess we don't get to choose. The air will run out four hours sooner than that. [ALL CHATTERING] Give me a plane deck. Rotate it. [SIGHS] What else you got? Captain, our cupboards are just about bare. You fellows got a catering truck you can put some wings on? Sure Briggs, if you don't mind your caviar coming out of a toothpaste tube. We'll be sending it to you the next time we can get Columbia up. What the hell is that? [SIGHS] Elliot! Elliot! What is it? What does that look like to you? What?That. What, a tunnel? The Universal Docking Device? Could be. It could work. What've you got in there on it? FELIX: We have just been told what the rescue operation is. It involves a Universal Docking Device built by Thornwell Aviation as part of its space program. This device will be carried up toStarflight by that heroic space traveler, the shuttle Columbia, about to be launched again from southern California. As we wait, each passenger is surely wondering if home and loved ones will ever be seen again. Yet, there's hope and a triumph of the human spirit up here onStarflight One. As for the rescue itself, the Docking Device has been altered to conform to the hatch design ofStarflight One. Working in tandem with NASA. Well, the waiting's over for you at least. You haven't lost him, Janet. Yes, I have. MAN OVER PA: Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one, zero. [RUMBLING] Columbia has liftoff! On its way toStarflight One. CODY: As you know, we've got some decisions to make. Including us, there's 57 survivors. Columbia only has its flight deck quarters pressurized. They figure they can squeeze in 20 at a time. Three jumps in all. Six of us, as crew, will be the last to leave. We'll have a drawing on the decision for the passengers. Now, these people will be floating through a snaking tunnel 50 miles up, getting into the nearest thing we have to a spaceship and gliding to a landing without engines. It's going to be scary. We've got to play it down. They're already numb with fear. I think some of them are probably in shock. Somebody could panic. What happens if a piece of space debris pops the skin of the tunnel? Amy, prepare the lists for the drawing. [PASSENGERS CHATTERING] Jack Bernard, Mrs. Edward Harvey, Mrs. Lucille Hunt, Frederick Baron, Scott McGee, Hal Paressi. Okay, that's the 20. It's been decided that you will go across five at a time. The five will be decided by the 20. I'll need your decisions right away. [PASSENGERS CHATTERING] Del, there are the blue plate specials you ordered. Thanks. Okay, everybody. Now, you're going to be kind of pulling yourselves across on a white nylon rope inside the chute. I'll go first, just follow me. Don't be afraid. You'll be fine. Now, watch your heads. MAN OVER PA: The first group of five hasn't come out of the tunnel yet. Still waiting, Houston. RAY: Okay, now if you five do as well as the last five did, you're going to make a hero out of me. Easy we go. [CRACKLING] MAN OVER PA: That's touchdown for Columbia, carrying the five rescued passengers fromStarflight One. Josh, it wasn't your fault. That conduit was still hot. Space Shuttle Columbia... You got five of them down. You can bring the rest home. I just killed five people! You didn't kill them. You tried to save them. Ah, what's better? Killing five at a time, or all at once? They have 12 hours of oxygen left. You are the only chance they've got! Don't you understand? I would need a bus to bring them all back! Then get them a bus. [SIGHS] There is a way. We can get most of them down, anyway. Culver Air has a booster tank for their Mayflower rocket, which, if my figuring is accurate, will fit almost exactly inside Columbia's cargo hold. Put down that phone. Put it down! Now, you listen to me, all three of you. That gantry out there, that orbitor processing facility, the one that Columbia's using now. That represents $93 million I've got to eat. 'Cause we lost the space shuttle contract to Culver. And I know how they did it. Industrial espionage. Bowdish, tell Mr. Gilliam about Bart Culver. BOWDISH: He's right, Josh. Bart Culver had a whole network of spies working on us. As a matter of fact, six of the key design components were ours. Those Culver cutthroats, shafted me for $1 billion. That was the size of the contract we lost, Mr. Gilliam. And now you expect me to go crawling back to Culver, and have him reap the praise and the rewards for rescuing my HST project? Are you telling me that all those people up there have to die? Just so that Bart Culver doesn't get credit for the rescue? What the hell kind of a...Just one minute, Josh. You just watch...All right. Both of you, get out of here. Josh, count on that booster tank. Excuse me, Q.T. Yes, get me Bart Culver over at Culver Industries. Our position's changed. Yeah, the force of the explosion shifted us around. Would you care to join me in a tube of roast beef? [CHUCKLES] Suddenly you're funny. It's the altitude. We don't have very long, do we? Hold me. Please. Oh. I love you. [SIGHS] I won't say anything to Lori. [SOFTLY] Wait a minute. I love you. For a long time. I'm sorry. I guess I got hung up on loyalty with Janet. And probably pity. I'm sorry I didn't grab on to you. Stay close to Lori, huh? JOSH OVER RADIO: Cody, there's just one catch. Say it, Josh. The tank can only hold 38 people, maximum. Some are gonna have to stay behind. And we can only use it once, Cody. I'm sorry. MAN OVER PA: Columbia has liftoff. After a record turn around of two hours. BOWDISH: Four hours and 10 minutes of oxygen left. MAN OVER PA: This is Columbia, Houston. At rendezvous withStarflight One. We're about to send the booster tank across. This tank isn't exactly a suite at the plaza. The people on the ground have it figured that it will hold 38 of you. I believe there are with your staff and crew somewhat more than that. Six of the crew will stay. And there'll be three volunteers. [PASSENGERS MURMURING] Well, I'd like to offer my services, if I may. Well, I mean there are things to be recorded here. Your courage, achievements. Like you, I always like to be in at the finish. Huh? Thanks, Felix. Now, we need one. I thought you needed two more. I'm about to draft one myself. The rest of you will have to make the most of lousy accommodations, but only for a short time we hope. Mmm. Is this tomato juice and Tabasco sauce? No, it's apricots. Oh. For a man who's afraid of flying, you sure look pretty cool to me. You ran out of booze and I ran out of cold sweat. Joe, you know everything on this airplane still functions. Scram jets, hydraulic systems, rockets, we've even got fuel. You know, the booster tanks is a two-way street. It's bringing us a space suit with life support systems. For what? I want you to fix the wiring to the rocket controls. You're gonna try and fly this thing back. Joe, you ever skip a flat rock across a lake and watch it skim and bounce along on the surface? I want to give reentry that kind of shot. Cody, I have skipped a few rocks on a few lakes in my time, and I never saw one yet that didn't sink. It's one chance in a million. Well, so was this accident. Cody... I am scared out of my mind being up here inside this plane. And you want me to go outside? [LAUGHING] Oh, no. [SIGHS] I'll need a wire stripper. And some wire nuts. And a dry pair of pants when I get back. Excuse me. Excuse me, please. Please. Excuse me. Excuse me. If you don't make it back, I will never forgive you. Boy, are we glad to see you. I'm glad we could make it. Back at you, Ray. Could you stow that back there, please? Let's form a human chain. Erica. Flashlights are inside to your left. Watch your step and hang on. I've got your other volunteer. Benny, you've got no responsibility to... No, no, wait, wait. Felix and I see this thing the same way. Now, if we happen to get out of here alive, we have got ourselves one hell of a story. [LAUGHS] Photographed exclusively by the one and only Benny Collins. Those pictures better be good. [CRACKLING] MAN OVER PA: All 38 aboard. The tank's separating fromStarflight now and returning to Columbia. Captain Briggs, can you seal off everything aft of cabin C? That's affirmative, Houston. We can divert all remaining air forward. We'll know pretty quick how much time that'll buy you. Thanks for being so helpful, Houston. Damn. Columbia will be bringing those people down, but we'll be monitoring you, Starflight. [JET FIRING] CODY OVER RADIO: Joe's just starting outside to the rocket conduit. Tap that vernier jet. Give me an honest day's work, Joe. I've got Joe outside repairing the rocket cables. So, if you can crank up those toys of yours and give me the best shot at reentry. Look, without a heat shield there's no angle that will work. It just can't be done. You got any better idea? I'll get one. CHRIS: Houston here. We've just got an update on your time of reentry, Cody. Starflightwill reenter the Earth's atmosphere in 73 minutes. Captain, it's going to take me hours to sort this thing out. No, it won't, Joe. You've got to do it in less than one. Oh, my God. All right, keep it coming. Come on. [BEEPING] [SIGHS] Okay, Captain, check the primary circuit. That's a good one, Joe. That'll do it. It's all yours now, Cody. Now, you give me a good day's work. If we try to put this thing back in the atmosphere, we're finished. Now, you tell me, what have we got to lose? [BEEPING] What I really need is a pulling guard running interference for us. [EXHALES] Put up Columbia. All right, now, add a plow wave effect. All right now, put Starflightin right behind her. Okay, keep her coming. Come on, closer. Closer. All right, right there. Okay, hold it. Schultie, get me NASA. All we've got to do is find the right angle. Hello, Houston. Yeah, listen. You got Columbia touching down here in about, what... Forty-seven minutes.Forty-seven minutes. Do you think she could make another jump with minimum processing? What for? So she can watch the burn up? Can she do it? Not quick enough. By the time she got back up, there wouldn't be anything left of Starflight. Got anything else hanging around, anything up there already? Hold on. We're checking. [SIGHS] Come on! Come on! XU5 is up doing repairs on a military satellite. Can you clarify? All right, now listen. You remember when you used to have to piggyback your twin shuttle to Florida on a 747? I'm going for the flip side of that. Sorry about the gloom before. That's all right. Josh just had a brainstorm. Columbia's XU5 is on her way to us. Could get here before we take the dive. If she does, we'll maneuver behind her plow wave and ride her shadow. She'll be our heat shield? Yeah, if we stay close enough. And if we don't pile up and take both ships out. Cody...I know. Columbia's not big enough. The wing tips will burn, a little. It's crazy! That it is. CODY: Recheck your projected oxygen, Bowdish, we've got big problems. Yes, we know, Captain, we had an upside and a downside in our projections. Then our readings are accurate? We can't make it to reentry. Not with nine of you using the remaining oxygen, no. Look, if... If there were maybe five or six of you... Look, don't ever stand where I can see you, Bowdish, because if you do, I'll tear you in half. So help me, God. Now, if we mean anything to anyone down there, then somebody will get that damn guy out of the control area because I don't want to hear his voice again. MAN OVER PA: Now returning from rendezvous withStarflight One in space after a record turnaround. Columbia has touchdown. All 38 passengers are safe. How much oxygen is left in those life support systems on the spacesuit? Let's check. CODY: We're sharing what oxygen's left. Cockpit's sealed off. JOSH OVER RADIO: Listen, better blow the airlock. It'll throw you off aerodynamically on reentry. That's affirmative. Starflight, you're in final orbit before reentry. The XU5 is on its way to rendezvous with you. It will be your heat shield on reentry. We're at three minutes 10 seconds from reentry. NASA? CHRIS OVER RADIO: Confirming. Here. If this thing really is lucky, you'd better put it on. CHRIS OVER RADIO: Ninety seconds to rendezvous. Okay. MAN OVER PA: Two minutes to reentry interface. One minute... Glad to see you. DEL OVER RADIO: One minute 40 seconds to reentry. CHRIS: Twenty seconds to rendezvous. One minute 20 seconds to reentry. NASA, where the hell are they? Ten seconds to rendezvous. [OVER RADIO] Starflight, this is Eddie Russell, Commander XU5. Preparing for rendezvous. Russell, we are 55 seconds from reentry. Roger, we're matching your descent angle and your speed. NASA here, we're tracking you both. Starflightis 35 seconds to reentry. Reentry will occur at 52 degrees latitude over the East Siberian Sea. This is an alert to Thornwell. Be on full standby forStarflight approach. You are in priority pattern for emergency landing. Twenty seconds to reentry. [SIRENS WAILING] MAN OVER PA: Ten seconds to reentry. [SIRENS WAILING] We are center your plow wave, Columbia. Five seconds, three, two, one. [RATTLING] We're not deep enough in the atmosphere. I don't have control. RUSSELL: Ease up, Starflight, ease up. I can't. We need more air over the wings. Control surfaces working now. We're in your shadow, Columbia. Briggs, we're coming to peak second of reentry interface. [SIZZLING] You're getting roasted. Wingtips? They're hot. CODY: Flight level? DEL: 430,000. We are at flight level 390,000. Standing by to fire engines. We have ignition. To all concerned, we have completed reentry. All right!Easy, easy. [SIGHS] With the heat the wings took, we're losing the skin on the wingtips. I'm starting to get control surface oscillation. [CHATTER STOPS] Flight level 52,000. He's dropping too fast. CODY: I can't pull up or I'll overstress the airframe. Cody, can you try to ease off the angle of descent. [BEEPING] CODY: We're falling too fast. I'm having trouble balancing... We've lost voice contact. Janet. Cody'll bring her down. Come on, Schultie, bring them home. SCHULTIE: He's still over the sea. Just stay up there, Cody. Stay up. Josh... [SHUTTLE SOARING] [WHEELS SCREECHING] [ALL CHEERING] Let's go. Nancy. Tell him... Tell him I stayed till I knew he was safe. Thank you. [SIRENS WAILING] Bravo! First time I ever saw a rock that didn't sink. Come on, I'll buy you guys a drink. [PEOPLE CLAMORING] Josh. Congratulations. Thank you. [ALL APPLAUDING] [REPORTERS CLAMORING]
