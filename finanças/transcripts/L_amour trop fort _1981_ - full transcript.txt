Don't talk to Bernard like that. Fuck Bernard. Enough, I'm fed up! Come here or I'll eat the fence! Don't worry about him, just play. It doesn't matter, I don't care. What's up, tadpole? That's enough, Charlie! No, it's not enough! Let him come out and I'll beat him up! Let go of me, or else! Go, go! Come here. What is it now? Mr. Maupas, the television called. You have to call them back right away. It's very urgent, I wrote everything down. Yes! Go! Go. Soccer game, first take. A lot of things are said about you in the stadium history. Did you get in trouble with the referee last Sunday? You know, we play to win by any means necessary. The main thing is to win. You're meeting a team with which you've already had your run-ins this afternoon. What's going to happen? We have to get back at them. TV on our side! TV on our side! TV on our side! TV on our side!

You got it! You got it! Go blue! I haven't heard from him in two days. He never goes this long without calling me, even after a fight. Listen. Honestly, what are you doing with a guy like that? I love him. You're just saying that because you don't know him. Not at all. I think you've changed. That worries me. You have nothing to worry about. This isn't your problem. It's between me and him, that's all. Yeah, you're right, it's none of my business. Well... Alright! Well, I'll be going. Thanks for coming. What are you doing tomorrow? I don't know. Have you calmed down yet? Can we talk? Are you redecorating? I'm doing my best. Please forgive me. You always ask me for forgiveness, and you always do it again. I don't like Bernard. Bernard or the others, it's a pretext. You don't love me? No, you know I hate you. You're not eating anything. Why did you take me out to a restaurant? You're not eating. I prefer your cooking better. I'll cook for you, then. Does it remind you of your mother? Shut up! Stop it! You're a sweetheart. I'd like to stay one. You are. What an ugly woman! You all have beautiful moms! You're lucky! That's not my mom, that's my wife. My mom gave her to me because I wasn't being good. -What? -She's mean! What? She's mean! And ugly! And you're a... A what? A... exactly! You should see yourself. She's very mean, she hid my bottle from me! If I get close to where it is, say: hot! And if it's not there, say: cold! Is... -Cold! -Am I hot here? Yes! Oh, she hid it behind her back! She hid it behind her back! See how mean she is? She always hits me. Do you know what the bottle is for? You get drunk! No, I fly away! I go to the Moon to bring back holy water, magic water to make you pretty! Never open an umbrella in front of a stove, it's bad luck, and it brings the devil! The lady is ugly! -That's right, she is! -I'm not! -Yes, she is! -No! It's an ugly lady! I'll show her... -Who can fly? -Me! Give it a try. You think the bottle is magic? -How long have you been there? -Two minutes. Don't smoke, you can't smoke in here. So? You can see... They're not good tonight, so we have to drag it out and she's not any good. -I don't think so. -No? Hire her then. Who wants to fly away? Don't smoke, damn it! I'm going to get yelled at! I'm leaving. No, stay, go sit down. You'll liven things up. No, I can't. Come over for a drink later. No, tomorrow night. -Don't forget. -OK. Things aren't going well with Monique, she's losing it. What's wrong? I don't know, but she's losing it. She likes you, it'll help. Come... Don't smoke, damn it! I just went to the moon, kids, it was wonderful! It was so beautiful! My God she's ugly! We should keep it at that price. I think it's reasonable. I completely agree, I'll sell it. With the certificates! At least I know who it belongs to. -All good, then? -Yes, no problem. -Thank you, bye. -Bye. Hi. Who was that? A customer! -Friday! -I promise, Friday it is. -A customer? -Come on, don't act crazy! Let me close up, then we can go. Smile. Very good. Go ahead... Hello? Is Charlie there? Answer, for God's sake, this is bad! Answer me, damn it, I'm telling you it's bad! Thanks... thanks a lot. I'm thirsty... How are you? She left, I had a feeling she would. My life's my own mess. She didn't take that with her. SHIT So, are you going? I'm nervous. Turn the radio on. This is Mozart's 21st concerto, my mother played it. Well, don't pinch my butt! What are you going to tell her? I'll tell her that what she did is disgusting. That you don't act like that when you have a man like me. I loved her properly. What good will it do? Nothing. But she's my wife. She mustn't forget that. I'm going. She's crazy! Calm down! Leave me alone! Let me leave now. Let me leave now. I can manage, leave me alone. Let go of me! Let go of me! PAUL SERELLE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL She heard what I said. I'll get her anyway, I know she's at her mother's. Start the car. We went up and down twice. You're sure it's here? Of course I'm sure. She invited me over a lot. How dreadfully boring! It's here. Is my wife here? Is she? Here. Listen, they're here. They can hear us. Open up, I know you're in there. Open up! I know you can see us through your eyepiece! Come on, open up, for God's sake, it's your little Max! Your darling little Max! Your little Max you love so much! You little Max is here! Open up! Open or I'll kick it open! There's two of us! God damnit! God damnit! God damnit! This isn't Mrs. Lemaire's? No. I'm done with your bullshit. Come on! Come on! The door is completely broken! Must be on the other side... No, I'm sick of it! This is the fourth time! It's on the fourth floor then... No, let's go. It was an even number. Yeah, right! You should've seen the scene he made in the building! It was unbelievable! Look who's here. Hi, can I sit down? Of course. Nice day, huh? I bought you this, Rose-Marie, -I hope you like it. -Thank you very much. Yes, it's beautiful. Thank you. Would you like anything? One or two croissants, and a glass of white. Nice day, huh... Yeah, it is. Yup. Why? Is that all? That's all it was? What is he doing? It's the third time he's stopped. Stay here, I'll get him. -Come back. -I am. What the hell are you doing? What do you mean? Where's the rush? Tell me, can you ask Rose-Marie if I can sleep at her place tonight? You ask her! I wouldn't dare. Oh, no. No, no, no, no. You're a pain in the ass. Come on. -Sweetie... -What? Max repainted his apartment. It smells like paint, could he sleep at your place? Since you ask... You're a sweetheart. I'll go get my bag I left at the bistro. Yeah, yeah. Are you pouting? No, no, no! I'm going to go undress. Why are you like that with him? I don't like when you're with him, you're different. That's nonsense. -If you say... -Tell me, Rose-Marie... Is the military man in this picture your dad? No, that's my grandfather. Ah... He looks very young. You're doing it again. Sometimes you act like you're my mother. I'll behave differently when you stop acting like a child. Fuck you! What kind of language is that? Fuck you! Fuck you! Fuck you! -Fuck you! -Stop! Stop! Stop or I'll slap you! I will! Try it! I'm warning you! What's going on? This isn't a good time! Oh... Stop. Settle down, it's over. It's over. I'm sick of this guy. He's eating you up, he's eating me up. He's eating everything up, he's eating up our life. I'm can't take it anymore. I can't. Things will change. Will they? They'll change soon. Yes... Get out of here. We're out of wine, can I go to the cellar to get some? Of course. I don't have the key. You know very well where it is. It's always been in the kitchen, on the fireplace. If I'm bothering you, just say so and I can leave. Do what you want. Go. Right, I'm going. I won't even shut the door. Sir. We're closing. Just a minute. Come on, Max, I'm sorry I got upset earlier. Let us give you a ride. Listen to her, Max. I'm not talking to you. Knock it off. Buses have stopped running. I don't care, I'll wait until the morning. Don't, come home with us. Come on. Come on! If it's an order. I'll get sick now. You know my umbrella stays with me. Right, I forgot. Do you want to sit there? You'll see better. Let's go. You like to drink coffee that way? Yes, why not? I don't. My old friend Jean Dumaine, my friend in glory. It's a pleasure for me to be here with you, with all of you tonight. With you, Charlie. And with you, Rose-Marie. I don't want any. Thanks. After 20 years away... One more, one more! Here it is... What's the difference between a nanny and a collapsing bridge? The nurse shows her breast and the bridge collapses. Now, what's the difference between... What's the difference between the Eiffel Tower and the collar of my shirt? The Eiffel Tower is colossal and my shirt is dirty at the collar. Thank you very much. Now, what's the difference between... ...a student from Valenciennes and a Muscovy duck? Why are you interrupting me? Because it's not funny, it never was. I see you flailing about on an act we did together 20 years ago. It makes my stomach hurt, even more than your disgusting chicken. -Stop it, Jean. -I won't. Because you screwed up my career. Your fucking drugs and your wife problems. You're lying. It was you. -Screw-up! -You went off the rails, not me. You went crazy. You and your hysterical fits. You've just committed a crime, Jean. I don't care if you tell me that. But it hurts when you do it in front of my friends. You can finish the champagne, you're at home. The show is cancelled. Mr. Dumaine. Thanks for the coffee anyway. Jean Dumaine, The Dominos, fuck that... Sorry you had to see this. His bullshit always ends up hurting people, even me. I keep telling him, but to no avail. He'll never change. Neither will I. Good evening. Shall we go home? Yes. What's wrong? I'm worried. Why? About Max. I have to go back there. I'll take your car, I'll be right back. A pint. Dumaine got what he wanted. What a nice evening! But maybe he's right. What about Rose-Marie? I came alone. Oh, shit. Do you have your ID? The door, damn it! Who said: "The door, damn it!"? Come on... Who said: "The door, damn it!"? I don't know! You don't, huh? Round them up. What were you doing with that? Take him to my office. -They don't have ID? -No. With the others. You can leave. Attention, attention. A car was stolen... License plate 1233AB75. I repeat: License plate 1233AB75. Green. A car was stolen. License plate 1233AB75. Green. I repeat: 1233AB75. I told you it was a nice evening. Is Rose-Marie at your place or hers? Mine. She'll have a hard time believing this. The first time I was in this situation was just before the Liberation. There was the same silence. Can you smell that? It smells the same. The background was the same. But these aren't mean. They're just a little stupid. But it wasn't fun back then, they were dangerous. Yeah... Aren't you tired? No. Drop me off at 165. Stop, stop the car! Rose-Marie! What about my car? Let me explain. -I don't want to know. -Please! Listen, you want to have your own life, I can have my own too. So bye! Listen to me! I don't want to! Every time I tell the truth, you don't want to believe me! To the 15th. Rose-Marie! Shit! Open up. Open up! Open up, Rose-Marie... No! Let me in. Just five minutes. We've through this before, so just leave! Don't leave me alone. You're not alone when you're with Max, are you? That's different! Of course it is. Look, look, look. I've been working, writing, look. Don't try to sway me, it's no use. Look at how much I've written! Go away now. You don't want me to jump, I'll fall on my head and die. -Jump then. -No. I'm jumping! I'm jumping! Hi, lazybones. What are you doing with that, Max? It's a surprise. Get up. Come here. Hold this. Close your eyes. Follow the wire. Open your eyes when I tell you to. How far? When I tell you. -Is it a prank? -No. Watch the root. -Can I look now? -No! Don't open your eyes. You can look now. What is this? Oh, my God. You shouldn't have, you know, it's too much. She wasn't that expensive, but the dress was. You're a great guy, you know? I'll get a knife. Hold her. Hold her tight. Charlie! Charlie! This is going to be really good. What? This is going to be really good. You'll see. I feel good here. I'm happy. I'm leaving in the morning. It's OK, Mr. Maupas, make an appointment for next week. Would you be so kind as to carry my suitcase to the car? My back's bothering me. Thank you. Yeah... Tell me... Did you even read my manuscript? Of course. Wasn't the first one I sent you good? The first one I sent you. You told me I had to make changes. Yes, of course. I did, so was the second draft better? Oh, yes. Are we talking about the same manuscript? Penguins on the ice floe? Yes, Penguins on the ice floe. Do I look dumb enough to write something as stupid as Penguins on the ice floe? Huh? Huh, Mr. Tatos? I've been re-writing it for six months! I write, re-write, huh, Mr. Tatos? And you keep turning me away! You don't scare me, let go of me. I'm going to strangle you, Mr. Tatos. And I'll eat your ear! Huh, Mr. Tatos? He started it! He started it! He started it! He did! Come here! Catch him! Come here. Grab him. Little prick! Control him. Stop him, I know him, I can tell you his name and address. He's been bugging me for months! Come on! I'll get you! Sit down. What's all this about? I didn't dare come to your house or to your store. Hurry up, I'm in a hurry. It's beside the point, but... I'd like to know why you don't like me. I don't understand your question. I neither hate you nor love you. You're harsh. I'm in a hurry, so tell me what you have to say. It's about Charlie. He's not doing well, he's in a clinic. I wrote the address on this. -What's wrong with him? -Don't know. He's at the end of his rope, he really wants to see you. I can go with you if you want. No, Max. You hurt him a lot more than you think. Me? You hang on to him because... Because you're lonely. What bothers you is that he can live without you. Don't say that. You live in the past, Max. You try to lock Charlie into your old memories. But you're not the same age. I almost want to kill you. You see? You're talking nonsense. You have for the last four years. And now it's threats. Charlie is a child, and you're taking advantage of it. So you're condemning me for good? Leave him alone. Just for a little while. Let him live his life alone. And you... live yours. I'll disappear then. You won't see me anymore. I'm leaving now. Kiss him for me. You did well to have Dr. Lebrowsvic call me, he's a great generalist. A remarkable man. I'll get him out tomorrow. He needs lots of rest. Thanks a lot. My best regards... Benjamin? They're all crazy here. You're leaving tomorrow morning, I'll come get you. Why not tonight? You know, it's a good thing he's letting you out so quickly, so don't start. You won't leave me alone anymore? No. Why? Because you're the greatest, the most handsome, the strongest. Because I love you. I'm really glad I met you one day, you know. Me too. I like being with you. I like the way you are. The way you look at me, the way you talk to me. It makes me feel good, I feel better. You're a great girl. Yes, it's true what I say. You believe me? Of course I do. No, please, do something. I'll talk to him. I knew you'd come. I could feel it. Excuse me, Max. Get in, hurry up. Hurry up. I'm taking you back to the bus. Why? I am. Why? I just am, don't ask. Don't be mad at me, Max. Why would I be? I'm not mad at you or at Rose-Marie. I just wanted to tell you I had found a contract. It's not signed yet, but it's solid. I'm glad. I also wanted to tell you that I saw my wife again. Things might work out. She's a bit of a bitch, but I'm not easy either. We never had kids. I'm sure that was a shock to her. Can you believe it? You could almost be my son. That's all I wanted to tell you. It's pretty good news. We're leaving for Rome in two days. I'll call you when I get back. Rome? It's a nice city. Yeah... I've been there, I have memories there. Bye. Bye. You know, Rose-Marie is a good girl. She's good for you. Alright. What I can tell you is that the prize I received will surely make things easier for me. We just spent half an hour with Charles Maupas. Charles Maupas, we've talked about your life, your career and I have one last question before we end this program: in everything you've done, is it usually autobiographical? I don't know, it depends. Sometimes I... I live... I live and imagine afterwards. Or sometimes it's the opposite, I guess... I'm really not sure. That was Charles Maupas. See you soon, Charles. I told you to aim higher. Why don't you? It scares me! -Are you OK? -I'm fine. When she comes toward you... Yeah... Cut, cut. When she comes toward you, you have to look at her much more coldly. OK. One thing: when you aim it right, you really have to express something about hate. Terrible hatred. -OK? -OK. Shall we try again? Here. Stop, stop. There's a bullet in the gun. What a shitty gun! It's really bad! Is the gun ready? What did you say? Ready with the lights up there? Let's go. Action. Raise the platform a bit. Announcement. The instance. Scene four. First take. Go. What's she doing? Didn't you hear? I said it's over! I told you I never wanted to see you again. Are you deaf? I don't want to see you again. You disgust me. Look at you! You just disgust me! Bastard! Are you OK? It's crazy! Let's do it again. Action. Action. The instance. Scene four. First two. Go. Our Camembert... -Charlie. -Yes. I listened to your show, -it was great. -That's so kind of you. Just great. Honestly. The phone. That was kind. Hello? Did I reach Rose-Marie de Boisel and Charles Maupas? Who? Is this Rose-Marie de Boisel and Charles Maupas? Yes, who's asking? Hello? It's Max. Max! Where are you? You know, as usual... Where are you? As usual. I just wanted to tell you I've been reading about you in the papers and I'm very happy for you. You're kind, Max. Come over. Are you having a party? Hello? I can hear music, are you having a party? It's not a party. Come over! No, no... I'll pick you up. No, no, no, no. I'll come get you, stay put. I can't, I... I'll come get you, stay put. No! I will. Hello? Hello? Bravo! Max. Good evening, Max. Good evening, ma'am. Let me talk to you for five minutes. Why did you come all the way here to bug me? You called, I thought you wanted to see me. You were wrong. Seeing you and talking to you are two different things! -Max! -Leave me alone! -Max, you're my friend. -Leave me be! You're my friend. You know you're my best friend, I'd never let you down. You hear? If you need something, money, anything, I'd give it to you, you know that. Say that again I dare you. If you need money or anything else, I'll... Go ahead, hit me! Charlie! Charlie! Charlie! Rose-Marie was scared! She's always been scared of me! I make people laugh, though, I make them laugh. I know how to make people laugh! Go over there! See, Rose-Marie? There's nothing here! Nothing! You can be proud of yourself! They soon won't call you Charlie anymore. They'll call you Mr. Charles. Mr. Charles. But there's one thing you'll never have. This! This! This! This, Mr. Charles. You'll never have it. This, Mr. Charles! Never! You'll never have this, Mr. Charles Maupas! Charles Maupas! The great Charles! The Charles Maupas! Charlie's dead! It's Charles now! Mr.! Mr.! Mr. Charles. Mr. Charles Maupas! Charles. Mr. Charles. Charles. Charles Maupas! Charles... Charles Maupas! Charles Maupas!
