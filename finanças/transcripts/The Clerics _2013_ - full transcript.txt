The Islamic Boarding School.. ..may not charge fees for its students. Now I understand Kiai, why Kiai farm and trade. But, why did Kiai personally intervene to harvest his fields? Kiai can just tell me or the other students... ...to help the farmers in the fields. / By helping.. ..farmers, We can feel their efforts. That way we can appreciate the rice we eat. Assalamualaikum.. Wa'alaikumsalam.. Run, who is she? Um. Sssarii Kiai. The daughter of Mr. Muhidin. Oh his daughter of Mr. Muhidin. Tomorrow, ..if there is time we visit to the house Mr. Muhidin's. I proposed her for you. Wassalamu'alaikum Wr. Wb. Wa 'alaikum salam Wr. Wb. Solikhin, ..did you note who was not praying in midday? Hamid Kiai. As usual, he overslept. What is the punishment, for those.. ..who do not join the midday prayer? Solikhin, ..Am I the only one who didn't go to.. ..the midday prayer together? Just say the others.. ..don't join the midday prayer together. Sorry Kiai, ..that was Harun and Kiai... / Solikhin, I'm with Kiai, ..join the midday prayed with the farmers.. ..who are still in the fields. / Oh yeah?! I'm sorry Kiai. This is the best cow here, especially for you.. kiss kiss Owalah, When I was at the market, I saw that the veil was very interesting. And I thought of my wife whose veil was worn out. It's really good, Mashallah. It's really good, Mashallah. It's beautifull? , hmm. What are you thinking about? This country is fertile land, many people. But instead it became a colony. If all Moslems united. This will not happen. Allah will not provide benefits.. ..and glory.. ..who do not want to live.. ..in congregation. Not for the previous people.. ..and not for the servants of God.. ..who live in the end times. That's what you said repeatedly. Yes, right.. ..and now after the Netherlands, Jepang are starting to colonize this country. East Java, March 1942 Ambition of Japanese to win.. ..the East Asian War make them invade Indonesia. They entered various regions of Indonesia, including East Java. Japan entered the Surabaya from west me through i Lamongan and from the south via Djombang and Modjokerto. Japan positioned itself as an older sibling. The people welcomed. The Netherlands formally recognized Japanese sovereignty in the Kalijati Agreement, 9 March 1942. Three months after the arrival of Japan, there was a ban on raising the Saka red and white flag and also a ban on singing Indonesia Raya songs. Slowly the people are starting to realize that Japan is not an older sibling. Japan did not come to liberate the people of Indonesia. Japan came to colonize Indonesia. By arresting Kiai, it was obvious that Soldiers Japanese it.. ..has no good intentions. Yes, Karim. I heard that just yesterday, Kiai Muhajar.. ..had just been arrested. Even though it was not long before.. ..Kiai Mahfud was arrested. The Islamic Boarding School.. ..and Kiai has become.. ..a target of Japanese. What do you mean,? Soon, Japanese will arrive here. It is really wrong.. ..if Japanese is hostile to enemies. They did not think that.. ..the islamic boarding school in Tebu Ireng village.. ..have quite a lot of students. Boy.. Where are you going? Durahman. Assalamualaikum.. Wa'alaikumsalam.. I heard.. ..everything you discussed now. Bedhowi is true.. ..that Japanese.. ..not counting.. ..on the strength of Pesantren us. They only see.. ..us as sarungan people.. Who have no rules. The reason Japanese arrested the Kiai was because.. ..the Kiai led his movement Nipon. In this life.. there are things that we can talk about.. t..and we can even compromise. But, when it comes to the matter of aqidah. It can not be contested. We bow our bodies in prayer. That is simply because Allah Almighty. Lillahi Ta'ala. Not being forced humans.. ..to worship what they worshiped. Lakum dinukum waliyadin. Subhan Allah. Subhan Allah. Kiai in here.

Tell him! Heii, what are you doing? Wait, don't run! There is nothing worse.. ..than mortgaging Aqidah.. ..to search for survivors. Only to Allah we worship. Please master if you want to torture me.

I'm a coward Sar, coward. What's wrong with you? Hamid dead, Hamid death because I, Sar. Because I'm a coward. I'm not helping him, I'd hide. I should have died with Hamid, Sar. Death Sar, death. Istighfar. Run The commander is waiting for you. If this detention is seen as.. ..a symbol of conquest, ..you are mistaken. If this detention is seen as a symbol of conquest, you are mistaken. The students can be very takhlit to Kiai, The students can be very takhlit to Kiai, But they hold on to Qu'ran and Hadist. It is the heart that will move.. ..their hands over everything.. ..to dzoliman. Harun said, Jepang mention anything about Tebu Ireng.. ..before shooting Hamid. So, ..Hamid was shot because.. ..he was a student of Tebu Ireng. Apparently.. ..we have.. ..to be more gentle.. ..in dealing with Japan. Is our attitude will not be contentious? Didn't you like the debate all this time, You are the one who suggested .. ..about foreign languages.. ..to be taught in Tebu Ireng. Finally, Dad allowed the students.. ..to learn foreign languages.. ..and write Latin letters. Man arofa lughota, min ... syarri him Who understands foreign language, ..will be spared their tricks. At that time the fatwa of the father caused a lot of insults but the benefits were only felt now. Because Japanese.. ..only allows letters to write and write Latin letters. The slur is meaningless in the struggle for real independence. Yes Dad. Kiai was not released. We must act. Agree.. Broke up. Pay homage to the emperor. Yours sincerely. Beat them up! Torture them! Commander, hope you think about it. KH. Hasyim Ashari is not a small pesantren. Islamic boarding schools in Java and Madura will ask for his blessing. When will open a boarding school. Hurting him is the same as hurting many people. And this situation does not benefit us. Torture them and enter to prison. Don't bring him.. What do you want to do with Kiai? You said He Is great Kiai.. So that the people know.. If their Big's Kiai having problem! There is no power except with help from Allah. We must use peaceful methods, not like this.. You still can speak so rich. Let's to Jihad.. Sholawat K.H Hasyim Ashari.. We have to move it from here immediately. Long time this prison can be broken by his students. We moved K.H Hasyim Ashari to Mojokerto. Do it. Yai, Yai.. Sholawat Dad.., I can't go with my friends. They don't do anything. I'm coming with you, we make Japan give up. Surah Al-Ikhlas in Al-Qur'an. Read, don't be lazy. Ok? / Assalamu'alaikum.. Wa'alaikumsalam. So, Dad was moved to Mojokerto. Mom, Mr. Wahid and Kiai Wahab will go to Jakarta. They tried to meet Japanese officials there, ...so don't worry. Mom teach here? I was reminded of Mrs. Nafiqoh. When the Islamic Boarding School was burned by the Dutch. ..Mrs. Nafiqoh also did the same thing as Mom. She is extraordinary woman. She is great woman. Mom and we all here, just trying.. ..to protect and continue what has been fought by Dad and also by Mrs. Nafiqoh. Hopefully each letter is read by child to be a doa for the Dad, ..for Mrs. Nafiqoh.. ..and also for the students here. Amiinnn Astaghfirullah.. I will try to contact Syaiko Siham and hold a meeting with him. We are very grateful. Mr. Ono wants to help us. Well, this is my duty as a fellow Moslem. The arrests of the Kiai will be a serious agenda in meeting between... Thank you. ..serious agenda in meeting between Nu in Java. serious agenda in meeting between Nu in Java. Hopefully the meeting can be in line with thought.. Please drink the tea. That's how I heard from Saiko Syihan... I will contact Kiai Wahab and Gus Wahid. Based on today's meeting there are things that should be underlined, First, ..the changes of political strategy ... pretended to agree with Japan ..utilizing facilities for preparation of independence.. What we have been discussed. The next, Make defence committee against NU Clerics who were arrested by Japan. Led directly by Kiai Wahab Abdullah and Me. I think, taking attention Indonesian's people with a way to take the path of religion. Because Islam is the most majority religion, here. Then we must embrace the Kiai. Does the act of embracing not seem weak? That will make them even bolder. The total population of Moslems in Indonesia is 60 million people. We can see that their militias are troubling our logistics . Maybe we can use their energy. In that case, we can't just let the Kiai go . We will hold a Kiai training. What kind of training? Training for Kiai so they will loyal to our government. And can be a friend of the government. Release all of the Kiai who are prisoners of our army Hadratusyaikh Allahuma Shollu 'ala Muhammad / Shollu'alaih Allahuma Shollu 'ala Muhammad.. / Shollu'alaih Batavia Governor's Palace Batavia Governor's Palace, 7 December 1942 We deputy military government begged forgiveness has occurred misunderstanding fahaman because of differences in tra dition among us. We... Ask for his magnanimity and understanding . Then on October 24 1943. Japan dissolved MIAI. Then founded Masyumi. Under the leadership of KH Hasyim Ashari. Remember, Woman like a clothing for men. Warms in the rainy season, calms down during the dry season. Yes Nyai, ..thanks for remind. How? legitimate? Legitimate. Alhamdulillah What's wrong? Legitimate. Sar, you are legitimately Harun's wife. Alhamdulillah. Almost of two years, we leave this room. Every woman wants to be most beautiful woman on her wedding day. That's veil, too striking if I wear it on Sari's wedding day, yesterday. When will this veil be worn? Emm.. Yes inysaAllah I will use it, if there is fit event. Who? What's.. ..made Mr. come here? I came here because until now, my heart had never been knocked. With calling to prayer Am I sinning, Kiai? I... ...have read that, if Allah SWT hates his servant. (He) will freeze (his) servant's heart. I often hear the calling for prayer but it is not more than a prayer time marker . Is Mr. not think that anxiety Mr.'s heart is a guidance. Not everyone gets guidance like that. You're free to choose what you like when you're study about Islam , ..in terms of religion and faith that science of understanding the belief that the hosts learned.. I asked for help from Masyumi's. We must form a line. 1. Make a corporation "Multiply the results of the earth". 2. Members of the propaganda lineup shape the produce of the earth. Japan asks us to double the crops, while we don't know what their interests are yet. We follow it, ..but if there is fraud we must reject it. Because.. ..actually something that obedience when mixed with disobedience apparent, roji wajawabuka must be rejected .. making propaganda sermons multiplying crops which will be preached at each mosque. After Friday prayers Don't forget it. We all have to multiply ... ..h is the origin of our earth . Because rice is our staple food , We must increase.. ..the result of the earth.. Because rice is our staple food. So we must prioritize planting rice. All propaganda made Shumubu and Masyumi seems less than the maximum. (Shumubu Office - Department of Religion) We must take a religious approach. Make their hearts moved not because of coercion. So every propaganda done after Friday prayers ... ...have to flick verses in the verses of Al-Qur'an and also hadits about multiplying the produce of the earth. That's the way to inspire our Muslim farmers Shumubu was very thorough, asking the Kiai to find Ayat or Hadist .. whose contents double the yields of the earth. Although not to whom... ...clearly the writing was directed at Masyumi. What if the doubling of the crop was distorted for war against the Allies? ..we must answer., ..but at the same time must be questioned whether the magnifying Japanese.. hat the orderliness of religion depends on the orderliness of the world, Whereas the world is subject to money, ...and the money was collected from the people.. Whereas the regularity of people's lives is dependent on the attitude of the magnifying magnifiers. ...Sorry ...Kiai... What's wrong Harun? I finished reading a magazine in the Muslim voice I ndonesia.. ..about the recommendation to increase the results of the earth. Do people not suffer Yai? The people were forced to work hard and then the results of their earth were given to the Japanese.. Sorry Yai, sorry if I was presumptuous.. Masyumi only asked the people to cultivate the land and multiply the produce of the earth. No called for the people's setor to Japan. The people saw that the masyumi was siding with Japan. Astaghfirullah. Masyumi, ..sided with fair dignitaries. Not the dzolim, Do you see a magnifying Japanese fair? What is your cook Sar? ..porridge.. Porridge again, ..are you sick? So what? Sar, ..just say what's wrong? We also have to share with other santri families.. Harun Assalamu'alaikum Yai.. Wa'alaikumsalam.. Sorry Yai.. I beg Yai, Yai don't cooperate with Japan anymore. Dul!. Don't do that. The policy of multiplying plants And supplying to Japan made the people suffer a lot... Even the granaries in the Pesantren are almost empty, Here, go with me! Please, think before you talk. The condition of the Pesantren's granary is very thin. I really understand. When I with other women, didn't talk to you about it. Because you don't need to worry about the granaries. - like this. Should everyone know what we thinking about? Not all people can understand what you are doing. In clarity, sometimes... ...there is obscurity. #Singaparnan, Tasikmalaya 1944 K.H. Zainal Mustafa //I ask Shumubu to resolve this.// Well, we from Shumubu will solve this. Send my regards to.. Husein and Wiroharjono, This is not a problem in NU. This is Shumubu's duty as the religion department. Shumubu don't like hand washing. Shumubu don't like hand washing. Then, excuse us Kiai. Assalamualaikum.. Wa'aalaikumsalam.. The harvest of the rice plant! Ladies and gentlemen... It's Ours! Ours! Agree! Agree! Agree! Not just we don't need to deposit our crops... Then... Japan must free the entire island of Java. "Allahuakbar!" Rice is ours! Come on take it! Come on!!! Bring it to your mother.. / Thank's... We have to go Sar. There is no reason to make me stay here. Mas.. You... ...have been here since you were a child. Kiai is also very kind to you, right? But now, I feel like, He is not Kiai anymore. We have to get out of here. What if you are wrong responding Kiayi's attitude? No. No way. Come on Sar! Istighfar Mas, istighfar. Sar. Do you still remember? Nyai Kapu's message... ~yes Wife is a clothes for a husband. Husband also clothes for wife. Right Sar. Come on! Let's go. Let's go, We must support each other, We must support each other, Sar. Harun Harun! Where you want to go? I want to stay in Sari's house. Let's go Sar! Run, Sar!. What's going on? I can't stay here anymore. I can't live in a place that sides with Japan. Astaughfirullahal'adzim, Run. Remember Allah SWT. Remember~ #Hadist ~ You have 3 father Run! Your biological father, Who married you to his daughter, and.. Who taught you. How nice Kiai to you! How nice Kiai to you! Run! Harun! Don't you know? Do you not know? Today, Kiai Zainal Mustofa will be beheaded in Ancol. It's because off the kiai did not want to intervene yesterday. #Syahadat And that's all because of Kiai agreed with Land Tax from Japan. So you don't forbid me to leave. Come on Sar, come on, come on. Aghh. ~(Crying) Grandpa sick, not now. #Azan (Calling for prayer) Isya'..... Mam... / What? I want to pray. Allahuakbar ~ (prayer) Dad, Islam does not teach people to su'udzon, but we should be khusnudzon, But we should be khusnudzon, How about Harun? How can he so prejudiced and don't believe with you? That bad prejudice, Does not always come from bad intentions, But can come from ignorance alone. Harun did not understand. Should I Explain to everyone, Why I don't want to intervene in the case of Zainal Mustofa, Because I agreed with his option. If I ask him to make peace with Japan, it's the same as I agree with Japan. I Understand, Indeed sometimes we need time to prove the truth. So you mean, That the head of the Shumubu and the head of the Masjumi are the same? This is an opportunity, so that we can fight for Indonesia. This is an opportunity, so that we can fight for Indonesia. From inside. By entering Shumubu, of course we will be able to take policies that do not harm the people. By entering Shumubu, of course we will be able to take policies that do not harm the people. Zainal Mustafa's incident, do not let it happen again. So Dady will take this opportunity? Yes. With a prerequirement, Daddy will stay at Tebu Ireng. Daddy will stay at Tebu Ireng. You, represent me. You have to read this. The head of the Muslim World Congress sent a letter to PM Koisho... About Indonesia's promise of independence. Muhammad Al Amin Al Husaini who served as chairman of the Worldwide Muslim Congress.. Gave high appreciation for PM Koisho's promise to.. Independence for all people of Indonesia. Alhamdulillah Freedom - freedom! Cheating, is not good attitude. Saiko Sikikan asked Indonesian youths to enter Heiho. Do you mean, Saiko Sikikan will send Indonesian youths to fight the allies? Do you mean, Saiko Sikikan will send Indonesian youths to fight the allies? Saiko Sikikan asked Indonesian youths to enter Heiho. I think so. Santri will not be interested in fighting in other countries. But... They will risk their lives to death. In defense of the motherland. Santri is not familiar with military. Then, if they will send to Burma.. it will be worried. In my opinion, Best way is join the military training. This will give benefit to Indonesia. Military training? Military training? I think, what Mr. Ono said is true. If Indonesia is truly independent, it means that it needs an adequate army. To defend the country. Accepted. So... Mr Ono's offer for military training is very important. So... Gus Fais agreed with me? How about you Dad? Yes, but only to maintain domestic defense. Do not enter Heiho. But this country. stand alone, form their own line, the Hezbollah Line. Hezbollah Is not to maintain Japanese sovereignty. Hezbollah was formed to maintain the security of this country. I ask that you spread the news about the formation of Hezbollah to Islamic boarding schools. At least 4 or 5 students from each pesantren are looking for healthy youth who are willing to maintain the country's security. Freedom! looking for healthy youth who are willing to maintain the country's security. I got a message. From KIai Wahid Hasyim, /Freedom! ...as a representative of NU. Who among the students here is willing? ...as a representative of NU. Who among the students here is willing? / Me! (all) Cigarettes! Cigarette sir? Sir? / No. Cigarette? Now, students are educated by Japanese to become Japanese soldiers, What for? Don't know. Anyone said, that they will send to West Java. *Reciting holy Qur'an What happened Run? Nothing You can't lie, Run. Your face looks like depressed. What happened? I saw Abdi with other boarding school kids. Take the train going to West Java. Anyone said that they wanted to be trained by the military with Japan. Santri's people are trained to be Japanese. Does not make sense. Don't be prejudiced, Run. I am not prejudiced. All clearly in plain sight. Run.. ....that eye can be misleading, reason can also be lulling. You should be able to see with your heart. So sorry Run.. Sar .. lately I like seeing you read Surrah Yusuf. What is wrong? There is nothing. * Cibarusa rubber plantation, west Java. Information from the Secretary of the State dated August 11. States the acceptance of the declaration in which Japan surrendered in its entirety. The formal handover process by the Japanese will be carried out as soon as possible. General Douglas Mc Arthur was chosen as the commander of the allied forces to accept the surrender of the Japanese defeat. Teks Proklamasi What happened? Glory Caesar!! Now I just understood, about the Kiai's thoughts about Hezbollah. The Kiai has plans run. You can't compare kyai whose leaps are already far ahead. Our knowledge has not yet run. Because of that Di. I can not go home to Tebu ireng. I'm ashamed. No face in front of the Kiai. We cannot.. let the pagan government take over our country again. Religious motifs are the most appropriate to use today. Based on nizul Islam wal muslimin, religious motives, then nationalism motives. Right sir. Religion and nationalism are not two opposing poles. Starting from religion, nationalism will emerge. Nationalism is a part of religion. We are just waiting for the time. * Allied troops land on beaches outside Surabaya. Bung Karno left a message for the kyai. What is the message, Bung Karno? He advised, is the law to defend the homeland? Not defending Allah, defending Islam, or defending the Qur'an. Once again, to defend the motherland, what is the ruling on the kyai? Come on help me spread the invitation. Kyai asked, all kyai are elderly to gather. Come on, come with me! Yesterday, We had a messenger, Bung Karno. Who asked, what is the law to defend the homeland. * Jihad Fatwa on September 24, 1945 Yesterday, we had a messenger, Bung Karno. Who asked, what is the law to defend the homeland. The law defending the State and fighting the invaders is Fardhu 'ain. For every Muslim who lives within the fa'assabah radius. The war against invaders is jihad fisabilillah. * GP Anshor Office, Bubutan Surabaya. Therefore, Muslims who die in that war, are martyrs. Those who betrayed the struggle of Islam by dividing unity and becoming accomplices of the invaders, must be killed. Please rest, sir! Rest first Dad. Where can rest, if war is in sight. I cannot fight with the students and martyrs. I can only pray from far. Dad. Am I also in your prayer? Or only the martyrs and the students who are in your prayer. When I begged Allah SWT to be kept away from the fires of hell, you were in my prayers Masruroh. Because you are a part of me. (Alhamdulillah) Assalamualaikum / Wa'alaikumsalam. Kiai..
