I bet you if this here was Joey this was you. Joey ain't got that much blood. I know how you can get rid of Joey. How? You bury him under the sidewalk and cement it up again. They'd never find the body. Ah, you'd have to kill him first. Why? It was only an idea. Wait a minute, I got it. We stab him with an icicle. So what? They never find the murder weapon. It melts. Where'd we get an icicle in the summertime? I read a good one. The Indians used to do it. We take Joey on a desert Then we take a keg of ice with a rattle snake in it and put it on his chest. Then the sun melts the ice. I'm worried. Last night on the television they blood come out of a guy's ear. Blood, you dope. That's ketchup! Ketchup? So that's how they do it ... You'd better change your shirt Lennie, It's going to get full of ketchup. Where was you? Why didn't you find me? I looked everywhere, but you wasn't there. I got tired tired of hiding. Hey Joey, Harry has a real gun. A real one? Yeah, he's over on the big rock. Come on. Hi Lennie. Watch this. Boing! Bull's-eye There comes a lion. Bam! Right between the eyes. Let me have it. Ain't she a beauty? She's a beauty alright Harry. Where'd you get it? What do you think? Where my old man hides it. Hey... Don't let Joey touch it. He's too young to handle Guns. I am not. Aw, Let him have a turn. Well.. Okay. But I'll have to keep my hands on it. Let's see it. Now here is how you hold a real gun. Where do you put the bullets? Right here. Say Joey, would you like to shoot a real bullet? But I don't got a real bullet. Look. First you put it in here. Now you cock it. There. That's good, Joey.
