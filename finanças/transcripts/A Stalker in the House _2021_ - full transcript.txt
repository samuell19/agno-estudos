I can't do this anymore. I can't deal with your craziness, your jealousy. You're literally acting like a psycho. You're psychotic. Look, you meet up with your ex-boyfriend, and when I'm supposed to be all happy go lucky, nice guy about it? I need to break up with you. Oh, don't start. You don't respect me. I need someone that respects me. I do respect you! No, you don't! We're done for good. No, no, we're not done, okay? Because I love you! Mike, how do two people that fight all the time love each other? We don't fight all the time! Then what is this? This is a conversation. No! This is a breakup. You're not dumping me. Oh, so you're telling me what I can and cannot do. This is exactly what I'm talking about. You're manipulating. You're controlling. It's not normal! You need help! You don't want normal. I want normal. It'd be a relief! No, come on. I know you! God. I know you. I know you, and you don't want normal. You, You I know. I know. You don't know me. I know you! Calm down. No, I don't want to calm down, okay? You get me all worked up, you turn it around on me, and you call me crazy, and I hate that! You're scaring me. I wanna be with you forever. I wanna be with you always, and if it's just, if I don't have you, if I don't have you, then I'm nothing. Okay? I'm dead. I don't know what to tell you. I don't love you anymore, okay? I'm sorry. I did everything right by you! And this is what happens? You turn it around? You turn it around and you break up with me? Okay, I'm gonna go. No, no. Okay, okay, okay. Let me just- Mike, Let me just get a breath. I'm leaving. I'm leaving. Okay? No, I'm not letting you leave. You need to get out of my way! No, I'm not letting you leave! Move! No! Are you kidding me? You hit me? I didn't mean for it to be like that, okay? I'm sorry. That'll never happen again, okay? This can work. It can work. No. No, you just hit me! Okay, if you don't get out of my way, I'm gonna call the police. The police? What do you mean police? What do you mean police? You're gonna call the police on me? I don't even know you anymore! You're a bad person! Screw you! I don't ever wanna see you again. Now get out of my way or I'm gonna tell everyone what you just did. And if you do that, it will be very bad. I am going, Mike. If I can't have you, I will kill you. I know I'd rather be dead than deal with you for the rest of my life. So be it. Stop! Stop! You made me do this! No, no, no, no, no, no. I don't want it. Come on, I'm horny, and I know you are, too. I'm not! You said you were. I didn't say it like that. Look, I like you, and you're super hot. We just met. You don't know anything about me. I know that this is a very sexy body. Let's just hang out. I don't wanna have sex on the first night. Let just take a breather. We are hanging out. This is fun. No, no, no. No, no, no. Hey, hey. I like when you're mad. No, this isn't a joke. Come on. Stop. Stop! What? I think you should just go. Wait, are you serious? Yeah. I really think you should just get your stuff and go. Wait, are you crazy? You know, it's women like you that drive me insane, okay? Well, you lead me on and get all hot and heavy, and then, what, you just change your mind? It's unfair. Unfair? It's called controlling yourself and not being a jerk! Ah, fuck. Okay, okay, I'll leave. I don't wanna... Mike, it's just not gonna work out, okay? Sorry. I'm tired, and I just really wanna go to bed. Okay. I'll text you. No, don't. Just... I'll text you. No, don't! Hi, you've reached Jen's cell. Please leave a message and I'll get back to you as soon as I can. Hello? Jen. Jen, hey. What happened? We were having a good night. What was wrong? What changed? Nothing's wrong with me. You were all over me. We just met. I'm not that kind of girl. No, I know you're not. I was not saying that, okay? I just, I like you. I like you, and you said you liked me, so. I did until you got all crazy. Okay. I'm sorry. Look, can I just come back in and talk to you really quickly? It's late, and you're wasted, and the last thing I want is you inside my house. No, I'm not wasted, okay? Please? I don't want you coming here. Okay, well you can come out to me. I'm still here. I'm right out front. You're still here? Yeah. I mean, yeah. I didn't wanna drive, so yeah. I'm just out front. Look, please. Just come out and talk to me for a minute, okay? I have nothing to say to you. Okay, please just, pretty please, 'cause I just don't wanna leave and feel like I've just been the most total weird, worst creep in the world kind of thing. And you won't have to think of me like that for the rest of eternity. I don't care that much to think about you for the rest of the eternity. Okay. Well fine. Okay, well then you just come out here please, and then you'll never have to see me ever again. Fine, but just one minute, one minute. All right, all right. Hey. Thank you for coming out. Well, you practically begged, so- Yeah, no, I just wanted to apologize in person. You know, you should know when a girl's not into it. You're old enough. Yeah, I know. I know, and I'm sorry. Please, can I make it up to you somehow? Whatever it takes, please. I don't wanna see you again, okay? Honestly, that's why I came out here is to tell you that. It's not gonna work out. Why not? Why not? Yeah. Because you're too much. You're aggressive, and that's not what I want. I like sweet. I like nice. What? No, no, I'm not aggressive. I am sweet. I am nice, okay? I just, I'm sensitive, okay? I care, and I just, I hate that you think that I'm not that person, you know what I mean? We could be friends. Oh, geez, okay. You know what, you're a good looking guy. I'm sure there's a lot of girls that want you. I don't want other girls. We met online on a dumb dating app, okay? There's millions of other girls out there that would sleep with you on the first date. Okay. But this conversation's over, and I'm gonna go back inside, okay? I'm sorry. It's fine, okay? And I'm sorry to ask this. This is so embarrassing. Can I please quickly use your bathroom? Please? Seriously? You're asking me this? I know. I suck, I suck, I suck. I don't wanna do anything illegal, and I'll be super quick. Pretty please? Okay, fine, fine. Come on. You're like a little kid, seriously so annoying. All right, thank you. I'll be so quick. Thank you, thank you. Make it quick. Yeah, of course. Back to the right. Back to the right, okay. Door code, 3341. Gerry Dilts. Who the dell is Gerry Dilts? Thank you so much. I needed that. Yeah. Okay. Can I actually just grab a quick glass of water? Sorry. I got a massive headache. You serious? It's the alcohol. I'm dehydrated. Can't believe I'm pouring you water, but okay. Thanks. Ah, you got chips? This isn't a free cafeteria. Oh my God. Thank you, you're sweet. I'm not sweet, I'm annoyed. You're very demanding. I hate that you think of me like that. So you wanna hang out again sometime soon? You're kidding. Well, there has to be a reason you let me back in here. And now I regret it. Look at me, I'm normal. I'm a good guy. Normal? I'm eating normal. Yeah. Yeah. You're persistent, I'll give you that. Okay, well that's a good trait. I guess. I'm tired, okay? Okay. Go. No, I'll leave. I'll leave. Okay, can I text you? Text me? If you text me and I do not text you back, you can't send me more messages. Okay. All right, so email, telegraph, snail mail, smoke signal. Oh, you're funny. There's a smile. 'Cause you're completely ridiculous. Okay, all right. I'm gonna leave you alone. But I'm just gonna quick peck on the cheek and apologize one more time, that's it. You've apologized a thousand times, okay? I know. Okay, I'm gonna take this. Uh huh. Okay. But I'm gonna text you. Okay, bye. See you. Bye. Thanks. I'm gonna text you. Mike. "Got a second today? Just wanna talk. Text me back please." "Sorry I was a jerk last night. How about we start over? XO, Mike." Wow. What a total loser. And the idiot just keeps texting me. You need to block him. What are you doing? I might have to. You need to block him now. Oh my gosh. He's calling me. Mike is calling me right now. What? Give me your phone. What do I do? Hey, it's Lisa. Yeah, I'm Jen's friend. Hey. So, listen. I think you should stop calling Jen. She's not interested. Bugging her and bothering her and it's not okay. She doesn't like you that way, you understand me? Hello? He hung up. You know what? Who cares? Yeah, I mean like onto better guys anyways. Babe, no more of those creepy losers. Oh, gross. But what's more important is my best friend, you need to find a good guy and I know the good guy for you. So he's a chef and he works at a really, really expensive restaurants. Chef, huh? Yeah. Imagine all the great food you can eat for free! Are you kidding me? You left your watch here. Did you leave it on purpose? No, I swear. No, please, can I just stop by real quick and pick it up? Yeah, I'll leave it out back for you. Can you not, please? Look, it's a $5,000 watch. My dad gave it to me before he died. Can you just not leave it outside, please? Okay. Then come get it. Yeah. I will be over there as soon as I can. Hey. Thanks. Hey, I got you this gift, a token of, it's an apology. I was a jerk last night, and I got way too drunk, and I'm sorry, and I was just hoping that maybe we could've a fresh start. So you brought a bottle of wine? Yeah, I figured we could've a glass. Do you not see the irony of it? Yes, I do now, actually, but it's a really nice bottle of wine. You are the most persistent guy I've ever met. So it's not a no. I don't drink in the middle of the day. Oh come on. It's not the middle of the day. Besides, what else do you have going on? I have to study. I have homework. I'm in school. I'm trying to better myself. You don't need to better yourself. I mean, that was corny, I know, but- The answer is no. Just one glass. It's not gonna kill you. Did you leave your watch here on purpose? What? No, no. I swear. That's weird. Then why did you leave it in the bathroom? I was washing my hands? So you take your watch off to wash your hands. That's a thing? Yeah, I mean, it's a really expensive watch, so. Look, one glass of wine. It's rush hour right now. I'd really prefer to have a glass of wine with you rather than being in traffic. Fine, one tiny drink, but you are terribly exhausting. One drink. One. Okay. Just one. One, all right. You're such a screw ball. Hey, did I tell you you have a really nice place? Thanks, just moved in. Yeah, it's like a minimalist vibe. Well, I don't like clutter. Where do you live again? A little ways from here, yeah. Not far. Hey, how about a toast? To new beginnings? That is so corny. Cheers. I really like you, and I would really like to take you on a real date, you know, dinner. Well, as charming as you are, Mike, you're not my type. Why not? What? Because I don't like you like that. There's no chemistry between us. Yes, there is. I can feel it, okay? It's there. Not for me. I got you flowers and a card. And I threw them out. Ouch. Look, I'm a good guy, okay? You don't have to convince me. This is not how you win over a girl. Well, how do you win over a girl? Well, you don't win me over. You lost. You know what? I think we should just forget the drink. What? I think it's time for you to go. No, just relax! No, just get out. I just, I can't believe I even let you convince me to let you in here. Like this is crazy. No, no, look, look. Just relax, okay? Please. Okay, just listen. No, I'm over this. Get out! What, no! Just come on! Get out! Don't do that! I'm calling the cops. What? No, stop, stop! Give me my phone back. Stop, okay. No. I'll scream and the neighbors will hear, and then they will call the cops. I don't think that that is a good idea. Are you threatening me? No, no, no, no, no, look, no. I don't wanna hurt you, all right? I just wanna hang out. Look, let's drink some wine. I don't want any more wine. I want you to go! Look, please. Stop yelling at me, okay? Don't hurt me. Oh, I would never hurt a female, okay? Okay, then go because you're scaring me. Okay, I'll leave. I'll leave. It's just that we didn't hang out. You didn't give me a real chance. Because you're crazy, okay? Just go! Just get out! I think now is the time for you to go. Okay, I'm going. I'm going. Sorry. Who the hell is that guy? It was the worst online date I've ever had in my entire life. Yeah. I heard you guys yelling and screaming. I mean, that's why I came over. Otherwise I wouldn't have. I just wanna make sure you're okay. I'm glad you came over. It was actually really, really scary. What happened? What a creep! I swear if I see that guy on the street, I'm gonna have a few words with him, maybe a fist. Ugh. I just wanna forget about that guy altogether. Yeah, well at least he brought some wine, right? Cheers. So I guess you and Gerry are no longer together since you're online dating. Yeah, well, it's complicated, but yeah. Well, you do happen to have a nice guy neighbor who's always had a little bit of a crush on you. Patrick. I live right next door, too, just saying. Sweet. I don't know. I just don't know if right now is a good time, and I just don't think it's a good idea. I can respect that. That's cool, that's cool. Well, I guess I'll let you get back to studying. Psychology, right? You remembered. Of course. I love psychology. I think the mind is fascinating. Me, too. It was good to see you. I'll see you around, I guess. Yeah, see you. That's okay. I'll walk myself out. Okay. Hello? Hello? I don't know. He seems so nice. Maybe I should've given him a chance. Who? Patrick? Babe, you don't wanna date a neighbor. I mean, think about it this way. What if it turns out ugly? Then you're stuck with a dude living right next door to you. I never thought about that. That could get weird quick. No, Rick. Ooh, yeah. Has he texted you yet? Did you give him my number? Yeah. I thought you said it was okay. Geez, no! I wish you would've asked me first. Okay, fine. Sorry. It's okay. Wait, why didn't he text me then? I'll make sure he does. No, no, no, no, no. I don't wanna seem desperate. Who cares anyways? It doesn't matter if he texts you or not because your bestie, IE me, just met Mr. football coach's younger brother. He's so hot. You're terrible. Sweetie, I'm just looking out for you. I mean like, hey, now you have options. If Rick the chef doesn't work out, at least you got the hot doctor waiting right in the wings, all thanks to moi. Wait, can I just skip the chef and go right to the doctor? Mm mm. Babe, chefs actually make good money, too. You can date 'em both. You're terrible. Terrible, terrible, terrible. Oh yeah? Well how's the psychology going, doctor? Good. In two years time, I will be a licensed therapist. Two years? That's it? Mm-hmm. Wow. You know what? I think you'll make a fine therapist. Thank you. You're welcome. Ooh, is that Rick? I think so. What did he say? What did he say? Okay, he said, "Hey, Jen. It's nice to connect." Lisa speaks very highly of you and was kind enough to show me your photos. You are absolutely stunning. "I would love to take you out for a drink." What'd you say? Perfect. I officially have a date with Rick the chef! I take all the credit, thank you very much. Yes! Okay, I have so much homework to do. I have a huge test coming up. Really? Yes. Are you okay to drive? Mm-hmm. Sweetie, always good to drive. In the car. Don't move or I'll kill you. Good. Thanks, Lisa. It didn't ring. You're outta luck. How do you know my name? We spoke on the phone. Mike? You're Mike? Hi. It's nice to meet you. You're insane, man. You're not right in the head. Jen and I are perfect together, okay? I sense it. She could be my wife. You're insane. No, I'm not insane, okay? Everyone around me is insane. You leave Jen alone. Get outta my car. I have a knife. What are you gonna do, kill me? Well, you haven't really left me with much choice, have you? You know, you're kind of beautiful. That's it, that's it, that's it. You know, it's really pretty outside. Yeah. Yeah. Hey, thank you so much for walking me back. I just wanna let you know that I had a great time. You're a cool girl. I'm really glad Lisa introduced us. You're a cool guy. That was sweet. It was. Hey, do you wanna maybe come in, have some wine? Sounds like a great idea. I'd love to. Lead the way. Okay. I really like you. Yeah? What do you like about me? You're hot. Is that all? No, of course not. You're smart, you're sexy. You're the full package. Mm, good answer. Yeah? Yeah. Wait. What is it? I don't have sex on the first date. Is it okay if we just kiss? Yeah, I'm cool with that. Yeah? Where were we? Okay. So when do I get to see you again? When do you want to? How about I come by tonight and cook for you? Are you playing the chef card on me? It's a very strong card, you know. People say I'm really good at it. Okay, chef boy. Come by tonight. What's up, man? Hey, what's up, bud? You waiting on a ride? Yeah. How did you know that? So how was she? Excuse me? Jen. You know Jen? You guys did it, didn't you? I don't really wanna talk about it. It's kind of weird. Why does she like you? Why does she like you, man? Look, man, this is getting a little weird. You have a good day. No, no. I'm out. Tell me, tell me! Hi, you've reached Jen's cell. Please leave a message and I'll get back to you as soon as I can. Hey, Rick. So much for cooking tonight. Guess you're just one date wonder kind of guy. Hope you had fun, jerk. Hey Rick. So much for cooking tonight. Guess you're just one date wonder kind of guy. Hope you had fun, jerk. What are you doing here? I thought I told you I never wanted to see you again. Well, I was in the neighborhood, and I saw your light on, so. What are you doing, stalking me? No, I just thought maybe you could use some company. And what makes you think I want your company? Must be tough being so harsh all the time. Try being nice. What do you want from me huh? You wanna get lucky, sex? I actually really like you, really like you, and, I don't know, been thinking about you a lot, and I don't know, maybe I'm like falling for you. Falling for me? You don't know anything about me. Okay, so maybe I'm crazy. Yeah, I would say, like actually mentally ill. You're nuts. Okay, all right. Well, I can't be that nuts because I do all right for myself. Oh wait, wait, wait, wait. What is it that you do when you're not stalking? Okay, I'm not stalking you. You know, talking to you is very exhausting. Okay, well, how about you let me in, and we can just relax, not even talk, and no touching. We just relax. You know the only reason why I'm gonna let you in is because I don't want my neighbors to see this like they did last time, remember? And that was very embarrassing. Okay. Just get in. Do you mind if I pour myself a drink? Fine. Cool. Thank you. So what's wrong? I mean, besides me being here because I'm the worst. I'm a jerk. I get it. No, what's up? I'm not gonna tell you my problems. I have a therapist, thank you very much. Okay, well, I can just listen and then won't charge you. Well, for one, I was supposed to be cooked for. Like the date? Yes, the date. Stood up. Well, you know, it's his loss, or, you know, it could be the universe sending you like a sign. Yeah, you know, like, the perfect man right is front of you. It's funny. 'Cause it's really corny. But, you know, I can cook for you. What do you got? What do you got? Good luck finding anything in there. Okay, I'm sure I can find something. Not much. Okay. Freezer? Frozen nuggets. Yes. Those have been in there forever. Well, they're frozen, so they're still good. I'm gonna nuke 'em. Sorry about blocking you. Whoa. Did you apologize to me? No, I regret it. I think you- No, I'm just, no, I just, I think I'm a little tipsy. Voila. Mm. Mm. How is it? Pretty good. Yeah? Mm-hmm. Good. You seem tense. Come on. Mm-hmm. How's that? Yep. No, no. Why not? I can't. Why? Just relax. 'Cause you remember what happened last time. Just relax, okay? This is such a bad idea. How about here? This is good. You are the most beautiful thing I've ever seen. I told you to stop. Don't. Okay, I'll shut up. Yeah, shut up. No more. Oh my God. That was incredible. Lisa's gonna kill me. Lisa? The friend that chewed me out? That's the one. You know, I don't think she'll kill you, all right? You don't know here. Yeah, I guess we weren't officially introduced. Can't believe I just slept with my stalker. Oh my God. I'm not your stalker. You got what you wanted, Mike. You happy? What are talking about? I like you. What, you wanna be my boyfriend? Yeah, yeah. Is that what you're- I'd like to be boyfriend. I'd love to be her boyfriend. You know, maybe I can even be more than that. You know what? I'm tired, and I think should go home. You're kicking me out even though we just made love? Love? That was not making love, okay? You know what? I hate that expression. Please don't ever say that again. Okay, so what was it then? Honestly, a mistake. All right. So I'll text you then in like a day or two days or when the timing's right. Now you're getting it. Okay. Hey, it's Lisa. I'm not available, so leave a message. Hello? Friends. Okay, okay. Hi. Hey. How are you? I'm good. How are you? Good, good. How's work? Good. So how about you? How's the psychology going? Good, I guess. Well, I'm really glad to see you following through with it. Yeah. Here's your mail. Oh. So how you been? You mean since you dumped me? I did not dump you. Then what would you call that? I would call it that I had to leave the country for work. I was gonna be in London for six months, and I didn't think it would be fair to you. So you broke up with me for my own good? Jen, six months is a long time. I didn't want you to be lonely and I thought for sure you'd be with someone by now. Wait, are you with someone? Well, I've been on a couple of dates, but no, I'm not with anybody. No Prince Charmings. That's funny. No, no Prince Charming. What's so funny? I don't know. I have this stalker guy that thinks he's Prince Charming. Did you just say you have a stalker? That was delicious. Yeah. I missed you so much. I missed you. You know I thought about you every day? Same. So hard when you left. I cried everyday for months. You and I, we belong together. I just wanna move back in, pick up where we left off, but better than before. I don't wanna get hurt again, Gerry. I never meant to hurt you. But you did. I know, and when I think about it, I feel awful. You didn't deserve that. You deserve so much better. I'm really happy about this. I'm gonna go to the hotel and get some stuff, take care of a few things, and then I can come back tonight. Okay. I'm ready to make us work. I wasn't before, but I am now. I love you. Your call has been forwarded to an automated voice message- Bitch. Your call has been. I'm coming, I'm coming, I'm coming. Mike, what are you doing here? This has to stop. There was never anything between us. You know, Jen, you deserve to be happy, and if this Gerry guy, if being with his Gerry guy makes you happy, then you should be with him. Thank you. I appreciate that. But you should also know that this behavior is disgusting. You're a slut, but for some reason, What are you doing? I love you. I love you with my whole heart. This is what love- Get out! I'll call the cops and file a restraining order on you! You wanna take it there, huh? You wanna take it there? You think you can just walk into my life, turn it upside down, and then leave? Please get out. You're scaring me. I'm leaving. You know, I will get that restraining order, okay? And then if you ever back here, you will get arrested. It's really nice, Jen. Sleep with someone, get a restraining order. Classy. Go to hell. Bitch. Hi, I would like to file a restraining order. Mm-hmm. Okay. Okay. Thank you. So I guess they're gonna call me back in the morning so a detective can talk to me. Hey, babe, listen. I'm here. I'm not gonna let this Mike guy near you. Thank you. Of course. I mean, when you said you had a stalker, I had no idea it was this serious. Well, it wasn't, and then he just shows up out of the blue uninvited and he explodes. Just I'm so angry. You know what? Maybe I should go to a kickboxing class. I feel like I need a hit something. Well, you can hit me right here. Go ahead. No, I don't wanna hit you. I wanna hit him, like just, in the face. Nice combo. Thanks. Don't mess with me. I really should go, though, and it'll make me feel a lot better. All right. Well listen, if it makes you feel better, you should go. And hey, it's only an hour, okay? So make yourself at home, wine, whiskey. Hi, you've reached Jen's cell. Please leave a message, and I'll get back to you as soon as I can. What's up, Gerry? Who the hell are you? I'm Mike. I'm with Jen. Right, Mike. You're the stalker. How'd you get in here? You watched her enter the code? I'm not an idiot. I didn't say you were. You realize what you're doing right now is illegal. Breaking and entering? It's a felony. Is that what you want, to go to jail? I don't see how that would work. You got my phone? Yeah, I got it. I also have this. Oh. You're gonna shoot me? You think if you kill me, Jen is gonna come crawling back to you? Think about it, man. You've been stalking her. She thinks you're crazy. There is no path to victory here for you. The best thing that you can do is leave, now. You know, I understand why she would like you. You're a pretty good-looking guy, Gerry, yeah, pretty well put together. Nice ride, great career, I bet. Older guy, more money, but you broke her heart. You had your chance. You don't just get to come back into her life and ruin it again. Okay. I will leave her alone if that's what you want, okay? You can have her. Leave her alone. That's how it's gonna work, smarty pants? No, man. We're drawing a line in the sand. What does that mean? We've come too far. I have to fix this. You've become a liability. Come on, man. You're not gonna really shoot me, are you? I can't shoot you. That would be way too loud. So I'm just gonna do this. Can't believe you forgot about me. I would never forget about you. What did you do to Gerry? Nothing. No, he decided to go home. Yeah, yeah, he understands that we're together now, and he accepts it. He's a really good guy, Jen. Why don't you take a seat? Yeah, look, the problem solves, So this is a good thing. What do you mean? Gerry. You know, coming back into the picture. Now he's back out of the picture. So we can focus on us. Did you hurt him? No, no, no. He went home. Just us so we can focus on us, right? You have a gun. Yeah. Yeah, but that's not the answer to the question I was asking. What do you want? What do I want? You don't know what I want by now? I want you, Jen. I want your love. I want your smell, your taste. I want your mouth, face. I want your skin. I want everything from you. I love you, Jen. And do you feel the same? Yeah. Yeah, I do. You're lying. You're lying. I don't like it when you lie to me. No, I'm not lying, Mike. You know, Jen, I'm not an idiot, okay? You don't wanna be with me. No, that's not true. That's not true. Remember the night that we first met and we were at the bar and then we came back here and we kissed? But I felt the connection. You felt it? You're a good guy. You're just misunderstood. I am. Yeah. I am just misunderstood. The safety was on. You just tried to shoot me! I can't believe you just tried to shoot me! You could've killed me! What are you doing? I'm sorry. Now I gotta punish you! Okay, come on. Shh shh, easy. Okay. All right, sit down here. Sit down. Sit down! I didn't wanna have to do this. I don't wanna have to do this, okay? Put your hands behind your back. Don't move, okay? You'll hurt yourself. Stay there! See, now you have to have to be punished now. You know, hands back. Don't move. Don't move. Okay. Okay. Let me out. Please. I didn't wanna have to do this, okay? You did this. You did this. Shh, shh, shh. Shh, shh. No. Please, no, no, no. Okay, it's all right. There we go. Shh, shh. What if you shot me? You went to shoot me. You made me do this, you know? I didn't wanna hurt you. I didn't wanna hurt you. We're meant to be together, you know, Jen. We're supposed to be together! I know it, I know it. We could have a house together, you know? Oh mean, that'd be so nice. That'd be so nice. Okay, I think you just need to sit there and reset this temporary situation, okay? Then you'll see what I'm trying to achieve, okay? Okay. Just gonna give you some time, okay? Okay. I made you a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. You know, it was my favorite, or unless you want, I can do the chicken nuggets again if you prefer. I nuke 'em. Okay, I'm just gonna... I guess you can't really... Okay, okay. I can't understand what you're saying. If I take the tape off, are you gonna scream? Are you gonna scream? Shh. Ooh, ouch, ouch, ouch. Want some water? Here, have some water. Have some water. There you go, there you go. I have to go to the bathroom. Really? I swear. I really have to go. The old bathroom trick. You know, I did that on you. I really need to go. Yeah, no, you're right. I just wanted to plant my watch so I could come back. You're smart, you're smart. It's kind of scary. It's not a trick. I really have to go. Please. Okay, I can escort you, all right? But you're gonna have to go with the door open. You're gonna have to go, and I'm gonna have to watch you. I'm gonna have to watch you go, okay? You still wanna go? Yeah. If you pull anything, I got a gun. So if you do anything, I'll hurt, Jen. I'll hurt you. I understand! Please. Okay. Okay, all yours. Uh uh! I can't go with it open. Yes you can. Please. It's a psychological thing. I get really tense. Please, just can I shut it? Okay. You got 30 seconds, okay. 30 seconds! Okay, okay. That's enough, all right? Come on. You're welcome. Okay. Go to the pole. Yeah, see? Easy. That feel better? Drink this, drink this. That's it, that's it. Yeah, nice. Okay. Good. All right, hands behind your back. No. Hands behind your back! No. Do it. Okay, good, good, good. That's it. All right. That's it. You're doing so good. You're doing so good. So good. Okay, okay. Shh, that's it. Okay. No, no, no. No, no. It's all right. It's all right. No, no, please, please, please, please. I won't scream. I won't scream, Mike. Please. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Don't you wanna kiss me? Yeah, Mike. Touch me. Sneaky, sneaky! Come on, Jen! Dammit. Now I'm gonna have to kill you. We're gonna have to kill you. Ah, sneaky, sneaky. That's bad. That was bad, okay? Come on. Come on. You almost got me. It's not good. I'm gonna have to kill you now, Jen. No, you'll never get away with it. They'll take you to jail. Please, please. If you leave, I won't say anything. No, no, okay? I'm just gonna make it as if Gerry killed you, and then he killed himself. Think of it. There's a heap of reasons from guilt. Yeah. Just think of all the reasons why. He loved you, but you didn't love him back, so there's motive right there. No. No. Yeah. Oh, Gerry's dead. What? I killed him. No! No! Does it make you sad? Does it make you sad? No! Does it make you sad that the love of your life is gone? You're mad, huh? Oh, you're mad, you're mad, you're mad! You're just so mean, huh? You're mad! You're raging! What does your psychology classes say about that, huh? You're gonna befriend me, get my trust, and then what? You're gonna hurt me? No, that's bad teaching, Jen. I don't think you're gonna be a good psychologist anymore. I hate you! Oh, come on. That's weak! You're insane! It's a diagnosis. It's a diagnosis. I've had that a few times, you know. You know, I was in the inpatient, one of those psych wards for the criminally insane, and they said that I had the hypomania, tendency to have psychotic episodes. Do you think this is a psychotic episode, Jen? Do you think so? Speak to me! I don't know what you would call that! You know what? Don't speak to me. Shut up! Shut up. Excuse me, all right? I'm gonna craft a suicide note. How do you think it goes? Dear Jen, this is all your fault, all your fault. I like it. I think it starts off nicely. I think that's right, okay? You said we could be together forever, but you lied to me. Similar. You lied to me. So I had to find a way for us to be together forever, and I found it. And this way we can both be in the same place, a better place. I love you all the world. Love from Gerry. It's kind of poetic, right? It's kind of poetic. I like it, I like it. But how's he gonna kill you? Does he stab you? Does he choke you? Does he shoot you? I don't know. He could bludgeon you, hit you, stab you, slit your throat, break your neck. Just ask. How do you wanna go? Jen! Why are you being so difficult? This love affair is over, okay? Now I've just gotta clean up this mess. Okay, let's do this. Looks like slit throat it is. Huh? Huh? Slit throat it is. You're right. 911. What's your emergency? Can you just come as soon as you can? It's a long story. What is your address? 5542 Sycamore Lane. Please, hurry. And as your therapist, I'll always be here to listen. I know life can get you down some times, and people can make you feel bad about yourself and do all sorts of crazy stuff.
