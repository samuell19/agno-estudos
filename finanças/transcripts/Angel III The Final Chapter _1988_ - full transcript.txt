No more bet. No more bet. Ball is in motion. Last call, ladies and gentlemen. Last call to bet. Hey, watch it! Hey! How you doing, huh? No more bets, please. Thanks Let's go. Thanks, Mellin. Thanks, bullshit! I'm supposed to be leading this goddamn parade. Cut through the park and take the tunnel. And no fuck-ups this time! I don't want a repeat of the Collins bust. Hey, it wasn't my fault. That guy was trying to pull the film out of my camera. Will you keep your head down, goddamn it? Anybody spot you on this operation, I'll be dumped quicker than toxic waste! You hear that? Yeah, yeah. When we get there, you stay in the car until we get inside. You don't let anyone see you get out. You get there, you take the pictures and you get the hell out, you got it? You're a prince, Mellin. Smile. And you're nudzh! Goddamn kid. Hey, what're we going to a funeral? Come on, move it, move it, move it! All right! All right! The party's over! It's checkout time! All right, move it! Piece of shit! Don't move! Life is a cabaret, old chum. You're weird. Hey, how about giving me a break, sister? I'm not getting in the car! Move into the car! Let's go! Move it! Oh, this is unbelievable! Hottest story in town and you're the only one that scored any photos. How the hell did you do that, kiddo? People owe me favors, Nick. Oh yeah? I love this one. Listen, speaking of favors, I need you to cover an opening tomorrow night. Blue Sage Gallery, east side. Send Jackson, I'm freelance, remember? Oh no, Jackson's out, you're in. Come on, Nick, give me a break, I like the deal we got. Besides, I got a full-time job. What, your book? Yeah. Waste of time. Who's gonna wanna book about crack heads? Nobody gives a shit about street kids. Yeah, how do you know? Besides, if I'm good enough I can make people see them. Pictures can make people feel things. You can't make people care, Molly. I can try. Hey! Blue Sage Gallery! Eight, sharp! What do you think he's trying to say? Darling, your sudden conscience is very touching... Damn it, Nadine, I mean it! If you don't let me talk to her, I am going to do some talking of my own! Shut up! This is not the time to be discussing this. Molly, sweetheart, the people! Shoot the people, not the mannequins. It's hard to tell the difference, Hillary. Adorable. Don't tell me not to drink! The dimensions of the piece include the backs. Sorry to interrupt - but it's important. - That's right. It's important. Do you think I could call you back on this matter? It seems as if I have a very anxious client here. Oh, thank you, darling. Kiss, kiss. Do you know this woman? It's not a very good picture, Molly. Thanks, Hillary, I'll give you a discount. Do you know her? Of course, she has a gallery in Los Angeles. Very sheik, lots of foreign money. Yeah? Where are my pictures, Miss Stewart? I'll bring them this afternoon. Do you remember her name? Roland, Rollins, Rollins Imports, that's it. Rollins, you're sure? I'm sure, I'm sure. It's in my Rolodex. Here. Do you remember her first name? Oh wait a minute, I should. She's been here on several occasions. Is it Gloria? That's right. How did you know? Lucky guess. You take my advice, you throw that number away and forget about the picture you took. Your advice stinks, Mellin. You know how long I've waited for this. For what? What the hell are you gonna do? You're gonna walk in there, you're gonna confront, you're gonna upset a life, expose yourself, and for what? I mean, just what the hell do you think she's gonna do, welcome you with open arms? No. I just... I just wanna see her, you know? I need some answers. I have a couple other pieces I'd like to show you. This way, just follow me. Can I help you? You should've asked me that question 14 years ago. My God. Molly. Weren't you gonna say anything, Mom? Come into my office. I don't know what to say. How about, how are you, Molly? Or maybe, are you all right? How has your life been since I abandoned you 14 years ago? Molly, I'm just so shocked. I don't know what to say. Look, I didn't come here expecting to strike up some warm, wonderful relationship. I just wanna know why. But I think you at least owe me that much. Why what? Why I left? For starters. Your father wasn't exactly the man you thought he was. He never intended to come back for us, I knew that. When I met Doug, it was a chance for a second start. Without me. I told myself you'd be better off without me. A 12 year old kid? Oh, I was weak! You never were. I knew that Sally would take care of you and somehow you'd be all right. Believe it or not, a day hasn't gone by that I haven't thought of you. That's real touching. Guess it's the thought that counts, right, Mom? I deserve that. I did come back once but you had gone. Sally said you went to New York, left no address. You look so beautiful, Molly. So do you. Just like I remembered. You still with this Doug guy? No. He left. But he left something wonderful behind. Her name is Michelle. You have a sister, Molly. A sister? She was born shortly after Doug and I went away. I have a sister? I don't believe it. Does she know about me? No. No, I couldn't bring myself to tell her what I... what I'd done to you. Where is she? Molly, I know this is gonna sound just terrible but this is not a good time for you to be here. Look, it's been 14 years. I didn't stop by just to say hello. Car is here. Just a minute. Nadine's waiting. I heard you, Roger, just a minute! Call me later. Okay? Oh, there you are. I am so happy. That woman who was here earlier, she called several times and she really... What's the matter? Nothing, I'm fine. Fine, you look like you just... - It's probably that Stewart... - No. - Want me to answer it? - I'll get it, I'll get it. Thank you, Marie. I'll see you in the morning, okay? Hello? Hi, it's Molly. Molly? Molly. What's wrong? It's Michelle. She's in terrible danger. They won't let me talk to her. I don't understand. Where is she? They've taken her away. Do you know where she is? I think so. Why don't you call the police? Oh no, I can't. No, I can't. If anyone talks to the police, she'll disappear, I'll never see her again! Listen, stay there. I'll be right over. Hey, hold it! Hey, hey! This young woman said she spoke with the deceased on the phone a short time ago, Lieutenant. Doniger, Lieutenant Doniger. So, did you know Miss Rollins? Not really. I hardly knew her at all. What's your name? Molly Stewart. Stewart. What was the nature of your conversation? I was going to meet her here. She was waiting for me. And how would you describe her mood when you last talked to her? She was upset. She... Actually, it wasn't much of a conversation at all. Do you have any clue who might have done this? No. Excuse me a second. Miss Stewart. What exactly was your relationship with Miss Rollins? She was my mother. Six months ago your mother filed a missing persons report, four weeks later she cancels that report. You're telling me you don't even know you're own sister. I didn't even know she existed until yesterday. Mmmm. So you don't see your mother for 14 years, you pop into town to say hello, she mentions nothing about the disappearance of her other daughter and then she is murdered. That correct? You know, you are a real sensitive guy, Lieutenant. They don't pay me to be sensitive. Have a seat. Your mother's assistant says that Michelle has not been seen since she disappeared six months ago. So? So... So why did your mother cancel the missing persons report? I don't know. Maybe she did hear from Michelle. Is your sister a prostitute? No. I told you, I don't know her. So why did you steal her picture last night? I thought I could have it. She's my sister. You know, Miss Stewart, I think you're lying. I think your mother did say something to you last night and what she said has some connection to why she was murdered. And I think you've been watching too much television, Lieutenant. Oh, that's rich. That's rich. May I go now? Yeah. Yeah, you can go. I'll be keeping an eye on you. Fine with me. I'm used to it. We made the 11 o'clock news last night. You wanted her dead, she's dead. This is the United fucking States of America. We don't car bomb people here. I told you to make it look like an accident. And what difference does that make? They can't trace it to us, can they? It draws attention to the gallery and who knows how much she talked before you shut her up. Nadine, she knew nothing. She was just upset. Here. Not a footprint on it. Taste. I told you I don't taste. Just set up the exchange deal for Friday. Sure. But you know, my dear, some of our buyers are very, very disappointed. It seems like your floaters, they're not what they used to be. They're bluffing, I am the best in the business. Still, they're very unhappy. Charm them. It's your best feature. Ah. And no slip-ups this time. Wouldn't want anything to happen to you, would we? Would be very upsetting to your adoring wife and children.

Come on, it's a great idea! As a matter of fact, I've even got one of those sleeping things for people, assuming we can find it. Yes, a bed! You take the bed and I will take the perch. Well what if you wanna bring someone home or something? Oh, my darling. You're worried about my getting laid. That is so cute I just can't stand it. Well, forget it. The revolving door is off its hinges. Okay, but it's only temporary. Great! Now let's get you dressed for act one. You got a work permit, sister, or are you looking to get your legs busted? Maybe she's deaf as well as dumb. Listen, I'm looking for someone who's run away. Have you seen this kid? What is this, "60 Minutes?" Get the hell out of here. Hey! Hey! What the fuck you doing, huh? What the fuck you doing? You mess yourself up, you'll be out of commission! This honky chiquita stepping all over our real estate! Yeah! Get in the car. Wait a minute! I said, get in. He's gonna break her in real good. Child, her legs will be over her head for a week. You wanna tell me what this is all about? Don't push me, little girl! I never mind picking up some new gash but nobody gets a taste till I know if it's sweet enough. Huh? Oh, it's sweet, daddy. But you don't have to play bad to get it. I'll do all the bad stuff. You just relax. Oh. Oh, baby. You sure know your way around a car seat. Why don't you hop in back and get undressed? I need just a minute to get ready. It's lonely back here. Okay, baby. Get out of them threads. Why don't you do it for me? You cock sucker! Not tonight, sweetheart! Hey, Spanky, how's it going? As I believe it was Bing Crosby who said to, I believe it was, Ingrid Bergman, "Going my way?" So this is the day job? Hey, can't get busted for bopping. Speaking of busted, young lady, I heard you were out past your curfew last night. So you were right about being a jungle out there. Meet any tigers? Only one. But I declawed him. Oo-hoo. Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo. Oh, kid, you're unbelievable. Hop in, I wanna hear all about it. No, I can't, I'm going to Hollywood to see if I can pick up some leads. Waste of time. Come on, I wanna take you to meet Neal. Who's Neal? Well, let's see what we got. Well, I grew up in Columbus, Ohio. Homecoming queen and all that. I guess it's a cliche now. I can't think of anything else to say. These are all outtakes but all the girls I talked to are on here. We room together. It's cheaper. And safer. Creeps. God, you wouldn't believe all the weirdo assholes out there. Oops. Can I say assholes? Ha, ha. That's Vicky. She probably met one of those weirdo assholes. "Chambermaid." That was my third film. Nadine? Oh, that's my agent. Can you turn that back a little? That was my third film. Nadine? Nadine, I know that name. She says that after the... Is she anybody? Yeah, she's everybody. She's the biggest agent in town for all the x-rated girls but it's a front for another business. The word is that the girls make the big money bending their johns in half. Doesn't make sense that my mother would know this woman. Coincidence. How many women do you know called Nadine? It's possible but she's very rich and she could've been a client of your mother's. No. This is the same Nadine, she was more than a client. How do I meet this woman? You don't. Yes she does, Neal. Look, man, I don't even know this woman. Well, you know people who do. Come on, let your fingers do the walking. You're crazy. You don't wanna get mixed up with these characters. Yes I do. I want to find my sister. Who're you calling? Friend of mine, he's a porno producer. Went to film school together. I make films, he makes money. But most of these girls that I interviewed were all on the set and they're Nadine's girls. Hello? Tom? Hey, it's Neal. Yeah, yeah, man, I thought it looked pretty good. Listen, are you still looking for some new faces? Because I got this girl. She's in from New York, she doesn't have an agent. Well, I got kind of an interest in her. Personal interest, you know? Oh, she's the prettiest thing I've ever seen. She's, let's see, about five foot... Five. Five. Sweet. Girl next door type. She is definitely a turn-on. Wait a minute, what's the guy's name? Okay. Thanks a lot, Tom. Yeah, I'll talk to you later. Goodbye. So, what'd you get? I got the dope on the director who's doing new video. Time for our audition, darling. Oh, God. Mr. Santangelo. Hi, Mr. Santangelo, I'm Angel. Neal Walker sent me to see you. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, the kid from New York. I'm Gaylord Dover, Angel's manager. What does a kid in porn need with a manager? Well, I try to keep her away from the riff-raff. So put her in a convent. Oh. All right, take a seat. Oh. Not you. Would you mind walking around a bit? Wait, Neal said you were the girl next door type. Next door to the Boom-Boom Room. Okay, all right, take a seat. Now, excuse me for being personal miss... Angel. Angel. Angel. Well, I usually like my ladies to be, you know, endowed. I mean, do you have any specialties or do you... Oh. Ah. All right, look, since you're a friend of Neal's, I'm gonna give you a shot. I'm all cast on principals but I need some atmosphere girls. Oh, well Angel give great background. You know, some say it's her best feature. Great. Be at this address eight o'clock in the morning. Somebody will pick you up and bring you to the set. Once you get there, don't leave. No phone calls from the set. Lunch will be brought in, you'll be paid in cash at the end of the day. Sound okay? All right. Hello. You know, Doniger, you are about as inconspicuous around here as a duck on the back of a horse. Oh, gee, that cuts me to a quick. So where you headed? To a friend's house? That okay with LAPD? Ah, Bernie Nicholson, also known as Spanky. Used to be a professional hustler up on the boulevard. You got the used to be part right. Wait a minute, I got another used to be for you. How about used to be Angel? Also a professional. Why, Grandma, what big ears you have. Why did you come back, Molly? To get a tan. Pfft. You know, we were investigating your mother's operation. You know she was trafficking in drugs? That's a lie. Classic front. Buy a few expensive museum pieces, stuff it with powder, sell it to a wealthy art patron, he trashes them and gets fat off of the guts. Is that why she was killed? Most likely. We believe she knew from the beginning about the art smuggling but when she found about about the drugs, she became unreliable, threatened them and blam. You know, you have a real way with words, Lieutenant. Well, what can I say? So, why don't you level with us? She never told me about that. But she did tell me about Michelle. Tell you what? Just that she was in some kind of trouble. Like danger. So that's why you're hanging around. I gotta find my sister. Come on, Nancy Drew, can't we work on this thing together? No, I can't. But if I need you, I'll give you a call. Yeah, by the time you realize you need us, it may be too late to call us. She's on her ass. She's on her ass again. Ah, fuck, Christ, why the fuck do we hire these people? Cut! Cut! That's enough, that's enough. Look Darlene, you hate this woman. You're supposed to be trying to kill her. I broke a nail. Broke a nail. She broke a nail. We're supposed to be shooting the hand job inserts this afternoon. What's it gonna look like in the closeups? Well I'll get you a fake one. You can work with a fake one, can't you? A fake one? Nail! A fake nail, you yutz! Look, I'd like to just work with the principals. That's a wrap on the background. Thank you, people. We should reload. - Sound... - Fake nail. She'll work with a fake dick, we're not gonna have a fake dick. Jesus Christ, I don't believe this. Hey, did the escrow close yet on that condo? Thursday. But all my units at the marina are rented though. You know, I looked at that place on Culver that you told me about. It's still too high. Yeah? So you guys into real estate? We're into making money, honey. Yeah, Pam puts all our cash into real estate. I'm Shirley, she's Pam. Hi, I'm Angel. Hi. Two more years of this bullshit and I can retire. She's trying to be the sexiest landlady in Los Angeles. Hopefully the interest rates won't bottom out before my ass does. Anybody seen my script? Yeah, here. Don't bother trying to read it, it's in English! This your first shoot? No, I've done a lot. Mostly out of town though. The Mitchel brothers, right? Yeah, right. Yeah, I heard that before. Actually, I came to LA to look for a friend. Maybe you guys have seen her. Her name's Michelle. Cute. Never worked with her though. Shirl? Let's go. We'll see you, Angel, see you. Bye, bye. This guy was no pimp. I know the difference. He works for someone. The same someone that sent him after my mother. Nadine. I wish I knew. Well what's the connection between your mother and a porno agent? Drugs. I found out yesterday my mother was importing phony art stuffed with cocaine. You gotta drop this, okay? You're in over your head, Molly. I'm a big girl, Neal. I know you can take care of yourself, it's just I don't wanna see you get in trouble. I made a promise to myself that I was gonna find my sister. Maybe if I can get to her, I can help her. Maybe I could help you guys. I don't know you real well, but I'd like to get to know you. Marker! And playback. I don't believe it, Darlene! Sell it! This dance could save his life! Sell it! Darlene, he's a dead man, Darlene! That's right, keep it fast. Yeah, that's it. Sell it! Make me believe it! Make me believe it! Over to him, over to him. That's right, keep him alive! Keep him alive! This dance can save his life! He's a dead man, Darlene, that's it! Bring him around. Come on! I smell formaldehyde, let's go! Christ, where's Dorothy Lamour when you need her? Ice cream delivery. These chicks may be into real estate but this is ridiculous. Chez Nadine? Undoubtedly. I'm gonna go get something to eat, okay? Okay. Let me go! Let go of me, you bastard! Let me go! No! No, let me go! No, leave me alone! Leave me alone! Let me go! Let me go! Get out of my way, you son of a bitch! Let me go! Oh God, please, no! No! You know, I don't get one thing though. I mean, if Neal's right, these two girls are professionals, then what are they doing working in a two-bit porno film? Oh, it makes them recognizable. The silver screen mystic. You know, a prostitute on the street can pull down 50 if she's lucky but a movie star, even an x-rated one, gets top dollar for spreading Saint Joy. You know, everyone wants to fuck a star, darling. Oh, oh. Don't mix the moo shu pork with the sweet and sour. Oh Christ, he's early. Cover for me. Hey. Relax, it's just Neal. Just Neal? That's great, like I'm four feet tall. Hey, it's gorgeous, huh? Spank. So, tell me, what do you think? Too much blush? Well, it depends what you're going for, Spank. Ann-Margret on an off day. Oh yeah, absolutely. You're a spitting image ofAnn-Margret. You be nice to this guy tonight for tomorrow he dies. I was gonna take you to dinner. Too late. Yeah, we sent out. I have a better idea though. Spank and I followed two of the girls home today and the place is too spectacular to be theirs. I know it's Nadine's. I wanna go take a second look. Can you drive me over? At this hour? It's perfect. Spanky's truck was too obvious in the daylight and I wanna get a closer look. Come on. Hey, I loved you in "Bye Bye Birdie." Bye, Spanky. Don't do anything I didn't used to do. Jeez, it's quite a bash, huh? You notice anything peculiar? Besides the fact that we weren't invited? No, look a little closer. There's no women. All the guests are men. She's running a house right here in this city, for Christ sake. It looks just like a party. Yeah, well you wanna bet what's being served for hors d'oeuvres? So how does she get away with it? Look at the clientele. There's not a man under 50 or a car under 30 grand. Someone knows? Yeah, someone knows or someone's being paid not to know. If your sister's in there, she's being well taken care of. That's not it, Neal. Gloria told me Michelle was in danger. She was genuinely scared. Well, she's got every reason to be. Look, Neal, I'd really like to put everything on hold here for a while but... Well, maybe we can for just a minute or two. Tell me I was right. I got a very sensitive ego. Okay, you're right. Neal. Don't worry, I'm gonna keep an eye on the house. Look, you have a right to know I have a lousy track record in this kind of thing. Well I'm gonna take my chances. Ugh! You're ruining your body with that crap. Well it's better than sushi. How can you eat raw fish for breakfast? Do you know what's in donuts? I'd hate to see the inside of your colon. Well I think that's something you're never gonna have to worry about. Yeah, don't kid yourself, in this business you can't be too sure. Darlene? Nick wants to go over the sacrifice number. Okay. Boy, she's real fussy about what she puts in her mouth. Yeah, except when she's on camera. Oh, ow! Hey, you guys, I need you to help me out with a problem. What's up? Well, I didn't come to LAjust to work in porn. Nobody ever does. What I mean is, when I was in New York I had a service, you know, an out-call operation and I need to get connected up here in LA. Forget it. Porn is a means to an end. Turning tricks is a dead end. Oh, give us a break. Hey, you think I turn tricks because I like the work? I've been in this business five years and I know how to take care of myself. But it's getting weird. You don't know what you're getting into. Look, I'm not an innocent little girl. Hey! Molly, it sucks! I'd just hate to see anybody else I care about at the mercy of these schmucks. All she wants is an introduction, Pam! I mean, what's the big deal? Then you handle it. What'd I say? She's okay, she's just touchy. A good friend of hers was cut up real bad a while ago and another one just disappeared like two weeks ago, you know, it's scary. I'm sorry to hear that... but I still need that introduction. Oh, I have to show you that letter. Turn around, Angel, I wanna get a good look at you. You're young, that's good. Any experience? Too much. That's why I'm interested in a steady job. You'll need that sense of humor in this business. Any specialties? French, Greek, B&D? I like it straight up. That's okay. You still look like a kid. Maybe we can pass you off as a virgin. Ever play the part of a virgin? Only once. All right, here's the rundown. You work for me and you work only for me. Shirley told me. You get free room and board and your calls come through me and I send you out. On weekends, I usually have a small in-house party, very select clientele. You mingle with the guests, you have a drink and entertain them in your room. No money is exchanged, I handle all of that. Okay. Here, I'm having a party on Friday. Buy yourself something sparkly to wear and show up. If things work out, you've got a job. Thanks. It'll work out, Nadine. Roger, there's a new girl on the way out, her name is Angel. Put someone on her right away. And get me Shahid. What happened? I think I'm in. And there's nothing that I can say that's gonna change your mind? Great. I don't understand how Michelle could mean so much to you. That you're gonna go through any lengths. I know she's your sister but, hell, you've never met her! She is the only family that I have. Look, Neal, you might as well know everything. This isn't my first time to Los Angeles. I grew up here and I grew up pretty fast. I know all about it, Angel. You don't have to tell me. You know? Spanky and I go back a few years. Then you understand why I have to find her. She doesn't have to make the same mistakes that I did. She's got me now. That's so true! You look terrific! I am wall-to-wall nerves. No, no, don't worry about it. Most of these cronies are so old, by the time they get to the top of the stairs they're half done for. You'll do great! Gotta go. Delia, have you met Colonel Harvey? Hi, Colonel Harvey. Well how do you say that in your language? How does he do that in his language? Fabulous dancer, really. Yeah! Yeah! You're great, great! Here you are, doll! Club soda, please. Spanky, what the hell are you doing here? Oh, you don't think I'd let you walk the plank without a net, do you? Spanky, I am warning you, if you blow my cover. I told you, I don't do that anymore, darling. Better make it a stiff one. There's a lot of hungry buyers here tonight. Boy, this is some shindig. Where does Nadine do her advertising? Mostly out-of-towners, foreign types. They give me the creeps. Bartender, bartender! Angel, you look lovely. Thank you. Oh, this is Mr. Fabazian. My pleasure. He doesn't speak much English, dear. See that he doesn't get bored. We go upstairs, huh? Mister? Fabazian. - Fabazian. - Fabazian. Right. Well, there you are, doll baby. Now I don't wanna hear any more excuses. Nadine promised me that you'd show me where to stick my wicket. Excuse me there, chief. We go upstairs, yeah? Where to stick your wicket? Okay, so I'm not Hemingway. Shoot me. One hell of an actor though. What are you doing here? I'm not real good at sitting around twiddling my thumbs. Obviously, protecting your virtue is gonna be a full-time job. May even break me. How'd you guys get in? I called that producer friend of mine, greased a few palms and bang. Listen, I have a surprise for you. You're incredible! Looks like I'm going to have to keep you around for a while. Did you put film in it? Listen, I've got an idea. I bet you do. I'll pretend to turn you on and you lead me upstairs. I wanna do some snooping. Who's pretending? Come on. You see that? Ready? - Yeah. - Let's go. Plan your move carefully. Cover me. Let's dance! This is Natasha? Hi, darling. Mr. Shahid, here, is a big fan of yours. He'd like to say hello. How do you do? Charmed. I'd offer to buy you a drink but everything's on the house. I'm not one of the girls. Yeah, but you're not one of the boys. You're cute but I'm with someone. Yeah, I noticed. He's a little busy and you look a little lonely. Why don't we take a walk? Okay. But you could get into trouble. Nah, I've been there before. Do you know Shahid? Yeah! Yeah, yeah, very well. Say, why don't we go in here for a minute? I wanna show you something, I've got a little surprise for you. No. No, no, seriously. Hey, come on. Come on. Michelle. What's going on? Who are you? I'm your sister, Molly. You're crazy, I don't have a sister. It's true, Michelle, Gloria was my mother too. She never told you about me because she left me before you were born. Come on, open the door, goddamn it! - Come on! - Listen to me, Michelle! These people are trouble. There's a lot of shit going down that you don't know about. You've gotta get away from them and I can help you. Get away from me! You just get away from me, all right? Gloria's dead, Michelle. That is a lie! No, it's true. She was murdered. I saw her just before she died. She told me that you were in danger. She was mixed up into some kind of trouble with Nadine and I think that's why she was killed. You've got to listen to me. She is not dead. She sent you here, didn't she? No. She wants me to come back. Well, I am not! I can take care of myself. And you can both go to hell. I hope she is dead. Do you hear me? I hope she is dead! Let's get the hell out of here! No! Help! No! Bastard! No! No! No! No! Stop, don't, no! No! No! Oh, no. Stay with her until this is over. She's still in there with those animals. You guys, we've gotta do something. We are doing something, we're waiting. Eventually she's gotta come out of there. They're not gonna have one big slumber party. Oh, the sins of the rich and famous. Oh. Oh my God, that's Pam. What're they doing? Somebody slipped that bomb a major mickey. Get down, get down. This is it! I'll get to Michelle, you keep the driver busy. Wait, wait, wait, what're you, crazy? Of course. Shit. Spanky, stay in the car and keep the motor running. Always the bridesmaid, never the bride. Good old Spanky. Ow! What the hell? Michelle! Goddamn it, Michelle! Stop acting like a child and listen to me! Let's get the hell out of here! Where's Pam? What're they doing to her, huh? She's sick. I don't know! God, look what you did! Well, I'm sure where that came from. That's right, so what? So what? Your mother was murdered by the same people that give you this shit! Once I was where you are right now. I know what's down the road and it's not gonna get any better than this. Well this suits me just fine. Let's go! Goddamn it, Michelle, I'm your sister. You just don't get it, do you? Hey! Let's get the hell out of here! No, don't shoot! Who were they, goddamn it! What do they want? They were just some kids, they wanted some money. Leave me alone! Get her the fuck out of here! Where is Shahid? Where is Shahid? No! Come on! They're in! Hi, Shirl. Molly, you were right. Pam never came back to the house. I don't think she's going to. Another disappearance? Christ. That guy, Shahid, what do you know about him? Not much. He's some sort of partner with Nadine. He's been around for years. That girl that he showed up with last night. I mean, have you ever seen her before? Just last night. She's my sister. You're kidding. I've got to find some way to get to her. She's in danger. More coffee? No. All you girls are in danger, Shirl. What do you think I should do? I think you should get out of that house. I think you should get as far away from Nadine as possible. Well, isn't there anything we can do about Pam? It might be too late. I'm not sure. Well, I'm gonna be sure. Before I leave there, I'm gonna get something to bus Nadine's ass. Pam and I were friends. This is where I'm staying. If you find anything, give me a call. Okay. All right. Shirl? Be careful. ♪ She's crying ♪ My little angel ♪ She's crying, dry those tears ♪ She's crying, crying, crying ♪ She's crying ♪ Dry ♪ Those tears ♪ She lays her heart out on the line ♪ To any man that'll give her time ♪ She always plays but she never wins ♪ And in the end she's crying again Michelle! Oh my God, Michelle. I've been so worried, I thought they had you. Marie, where is my mother? Your mother's dead. It was horrible. The police said she was murdered. It's my fault isn't it? She was so worried about you. Marie, I have a sister, don't I? A sister? That girl, Molly, she tried to warn me. There was a young woman who came to see Gloria the afternoon of the accident. She tried to help me, Marie, and now she's in trouble. I don't understand. She's my sister. I have to stop them. Michelle! That's what he said. Come on, honey. Really, I wanna be an actress. Come on. Pam. Girls for drugs. White slavery. Middle Eastern, most likely. Cocaine gets shipped in, girls get shipped out. Oh my God, Pam. Think you can remember which warehouse you saw them at? Absolutely, I know where it is. All right, I'm gonna need a warrant and a signed statement. I think you'd better come with me. By the way, from now on it's my ballgame. Any fuck-ups now and we lose 'em. It's all yours but promise me you'll get my sister out before anything happens. Priority. Shirl, I think you better disappear for awhile before, you know, I mean, voluntarily... No, I'm not going anywhere, not yet! We might've lost Pam but we're not gonna lose Michelle. You heard what Doniger said. Yeah, he said that to you. Nadine doesn't even know that I'm on to her. I can reach Michelle from the inside and keep an eye on her. Shirl. Give her this. Show her the picture inside. Then maybe she'll believe you. All right. Be careful. It's out of control, I'm telling you. Everything's on hold until we can call the ship. Gloria had another daughter we didn't know about. That Stewart girl. Gloria must've talked before she died. I'll handle it. No you won't, goddamn it! This is gonna be easier than I thought! What the fuck are you doing? Put that down. Not this time! You killed my mother! You look like you can handle things. Shut up. Carlos. No! I'm leaving for Vegas tonight. Empty the warehouse. And see that she gets a long vacation! Spanky? Spanky, are you here? Spanky, it's me. No! No! God! No! Oh! Hello, dear. Like mother, like daughter, I'm afraid. You know, Gloria, she could've profited handsomely from the ride too but I'm afraid a conscience got in her way. Something you wouldn't know about. Enjoy the scenery while you can, Angel. In a few days, you'll be on your back in a whorehouse in Calcutta fucking the locals for fish heads and rice. You know, you and Michelle should fetch top dollar. Even though white girls, they wear out very quickly. Lucky for me, there is always a demand for new flesh. How does it look from this side, sweetheart? Get out! Loved your little story, Nadine. But this time, I'm writing the last chapter. Get out! Roger! - Hey, back off! - One move, or what little brains she does have will be history! Let's go. Cuff him! Let's go, scumbag! Move it. Move it! You can't be serious. Get in! I said, get in! Let's go! Come on, come on, let's go, Spanky! We wouldn't be going to anyplace rational, like, say the police station? Not yet. I just have one stop to make on the way. Oh shit, they're playing our song. Here's our stop! Pier 13, warehouse nine! Shootout in progress! We need backups! Goddamn it, Molly! Shit, watch out! Call Doniger, tell him it's the warehouse! It's okay. It's about time you were good for something. - No! - Get up! No! No! No! No! No! No! I will kill her! Do you hear me? I'm gonna blow her fucking brains out! I mean it! I'm gonna shoot her sweet brains out before I die! Hey! There's too many of us down here. Killing the girl is just gonna get you fried! Just watch me, little boy! All right, look! What do you want? Tell me what you want! Throw your gun out! Now step out! I wanna see you! Okay. Let the girl go. You stupid fucking jerk! Did you really think it was that easy? You all make me sick! Son of a bitch! No! Somebody call an ambulance! What're you doing trying to save my life, you dumb jerk? Who do you think you are, Wyatt Earp? Oh, you know me. Anything for a little attention. Hey, Spanky, come on! - Spanky, come on! - Spanky, you hang in there! Where the hell's that ambulance? Spanky! He'll be okay, don't worry. I don't wanna think about the shit that's gonna come down over this. Each one of you is just damn lucky to be alive. I'd say I was damn lucky to have a sister like Molly. Hey, I couldn't afford to lose you too. You know, I must admit, in what you lock in common sense, you more than make up for in sheer chutzpah. Gee, thanks, Doniger. You know, I never had a family before. But it sure is gonna be nice starting one now. Oh my God, the snow queen!
