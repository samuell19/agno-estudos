You have no respect for me. What are you talking about? Nobody, no one will spoil my birthday. No one. I know everything. - Like what? - I know everything. - You don't know shit. - Let's start with this. Who's Malmo? Malmo? I gave you everything! A job, friendship, advice! You didn't give me nothing! Aah! You know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna confront this Malmo fuck. And then I'm gonna deal with Harvey after that. I'm gonna do it the right way. By that time, it's gonna be too late. All your money's gonna be gone. I mean, this guy's stalking you. You already know he's a psycho. What we need to do is come up with a plan. Something... something he can't catch on to. If you remember, trust me. Friendship before money. Can you say that? - Yeah. - What? Come on. "Trust me, friendship before money." - Yeah. - Right. ♪ Oh, what a day like today ♪ Oh, how everything changed ♪ I put a bowl of love ♪ Out the back door ♪ Ain't got?? ♪ Out there no more ♪ Is there somebody out there ♪ Waiting for me I have a good story for you, a familiar story. One guy meet another in a big city, they have dreams. But something changed. Greed, hatred, jealousy. You know this word, Jon? Do you? Come on, listen to me. If you're gonna end it, just do it! All right? I'm not playing this stupid game. Sometimes in life we fall down. I'm drowning, but you left me, my friend. And I wonder, what will become of me? Will I die alone? You were my best friend, and my worst friend. ♪ Oh, what a day like today Jon... What the fuck did you do? An ATM? Are you kidding me? It's not an ATM. It's a fuckin' safe. "It's a fuckin' safe." Hurry up, Jon. What are you doing? Come on, get out of here. Hurry up! I'm trying to! I thought you said you saw him do that. I did! I watched him from right over there. It doesn't matter. How hard is it to use a fucking key? Are you kidding me right now? Let's go! Come on... - Jon! - Shit! I got the wrong keys! He's got two sets of keys. - We gotta go back to the cliff. - What do you mean? It's the only way we'll get this thing open. - You didn't check it? - No! I didn't check his keys as he was falling off the cliff. - Well, you should've... - Wait! Wait. You got the car jack in the back, right? Why don't we just take the whole thing with us? It's an ATM machine! All right, just... It's not even bolted. Shut up! It feels like there's so much money in here. It's gonna hurt your back. I am so tired. I can barely keep my eyes open. We're still eight hours away. That's fine, let me drive. I'm not-I'm not tired at all. What's that? Is everything all right? Yeah... it's probably just my boss, wondering where I'm at. Probably thinks something happened to me. Let's get back on the road. I don't feel comfortable just sitting out here. We're fine. We're in the middle of nowhere. What highway are we on, anyway? We should be on the 8. I know where I'm going. - I got this.. - Shit. Just let me handle it. I got it. Shit. He's coming up. Fuck! Evening! Hey, officer. How you doing? Everything okay in here? Yeah, you know, I just... I pulled over 'cause I was starting to get a little bit tired. I noticed. I saw you swerving back there, - in Yuma highway. - Yeah. I recognized the worm on the back of your car. - Tags are expired. - What? Really? Nine months past due. My God. I'm so sorry. I'm so bad about getting these things done. - I'll get it fixed first thing in the morning. May I see your license and registration, please? Yeah, sure. Jon? - Can you get that? - Yeah. Yeah. There's an... owner's manual... This is really embarrassing. I moved the paperwork out and placed it into my other purse, and we're going through this move, so you know how things can kind of get jumbled up? Your license as well? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Sorry. Yeah... Here you go. Where are you headin'? We're headin' up toward Colorado, Estes Park? You guys coming from Mexico? No, officer, no. No, not Mexico. What do you guys got back there? Just packing stuff. We got a call... Border Patrol gave us a call about a minivan fitting your description. A little suspicious. Possible smuggling. Officer, I already told you. We're just on our way to Colorado with a bunch of our moving stuff. Let's take a look. Please open your vehicle. No. Excuse me? According to Arizona state law, you need my consent, or a warrant in order to search a vehicle. Now, I'm willing to accept a violation for expired tags, but that doesn't give you a valid reason or probable cause to search my vehicle. Well, you said it yourself. Probable cause. No, I'd consider it harassment. Okay, Judge Judy. We'll have it your way. You two sit tight. Holy fuck! Why didn't you just let him see it? Just tell him it's a collector's item or something. I'll let you off with a warning. You need to get off my highway with these expired tags. There's a bed and breakfast up the road. Oak Bar. Get this taken care of first thing. You two have a good night. Shit! That was close. Glad we got out of that. What do you want to do? Well, let's get off the highway, all right? If we get pulled over, we're fucked, we lose everything. I don't really want to stay out here, do you? Look, it's a mile away. Hello? Can I help you with something? Um... we're just looking for a room for the night. Um, I'm sorry, but you know, this is an exclusive residence, it's a private retreat, people book this place five months in advance, so I don't think we're going to be able to find anything to accommodate you. I don't know what else to tell you. Just one night, a few hours. Okay, all right. Listen. Just hold on a minute. Let me check something, and I'll be right back. So here we are. The Night Owl suite. Wait, I'm... I'm forgetting something. I didn't tell you that breakfast is served tomorrow 6:00 to 9:00, and it's tea and crumpets, English style. You will be joining us, right? Actually, no. We're gonna head out early in the morning. Yeah, we just got to hit the road, you know, get an early start? Guess you're gonna be needing these. Just make sure you sign the guest book before you leave... bitches. I think we got enough to get to Colorado. All right? Tomorrow morning we find a pickup truck or something, ditch the van... I think we'll be fine. What? Tomorrow morning. Just get a different car, get out of here. I really need to get some fresh air. What's wrong? Yeah, and then the cop just showed up. Nothing's going to plan and I kind of need your help. Calm down. Jon, when you end up in jail, I will not rescue you, okay? The only thing what I can do, I can send you a few oranges. Tu comprends la vie? Mark my words, it will not end up well for you. Okay? I have a feeling that cop's gonna come back. I really think we need to get out of here. We can't get out of here. We have the van. We have to wait till the morning. I made a phone call, so someone's on the way to get us. You called somebody to come here? Why would you do that? That's a terrible idea! You need to chill out. This is the best bet we have. How are you gonna explain this ATM in the back of your van? Like your creepy friend said, it's a collector's item. That's all it is. A safe. Who'd you call? It's my uncle. I was so worried about you. I'm glad you're okay. Give me a hug. Goddamn, it's good to see you, lil' darling. You must be Jon. It's a pleasure to meet you. Now I know you're in a little bit of trouble, but I'm here to get you out of it. Holy shit! You weren't kidding! You really do need my help. Where the hell did you get this thing? Hey, nothing like mobile banking? Wow. This is gonna be fun. So what brings you out to Tucson, darling? We're just on our way to Colorado. Colorado... you know, I just got back from a road trip there a few weeks back, by Harley? God dammit, it was great! Beautiful country. Man of few words, amigo? I like him that way. No, he's just a little bit shy. We appreciate your help. Yeah, well, you can thank me later. Now the week before that, I had a date with a big woman. I mean big, big, big, gosh! She was big, and it was like a wrestling match, like, "Who's gonna take who?" I was like, "what the heck?" You know, and I hung in there, manned up, I took her down... We had a great time. That was fun. I gotta tell you, every once in a while you just gotta go for that kind of stuff! You know what I'm saying, Jon? You know what I'm saying. Good... good times. It's good to see you. How far is the ranch from here? The ranch's about an hour and a half. We'll get there in no time. You all look a little bit tired. You know what? It's okay, take a little catnap. Relax. I got this. Sometimes life gives you lemons. You need to make little drink. Cut the fuckin' bullshit, all right? Who's Malmo? Jon, you never change! I'm trying to teach you something. And you ruin everything. Where'd all the fuckin' money go? This was done not for money, Jon, but for friendship. To teach one friend about life. You sold our fuckin' friendship! You stole my whole goddamn idea. You will learn today, my friend, you cannot buy or sell friendship. Or loyalty. You cannot. I know you have secrets too, Jon. Like your bloody t-shirt. When we first met, I knew. But we'll get to that. We'll get to the truth. All the truth, Jon. Come on in, sit down, relax. Make yourselves at home. Hey, there's food in the fridge. I'm not gonna fuckin' babysit you. You guys are gonna have to hang tight... while I get a little workout in. A midnight pump. Get that look out of your eye, Jon. Not for you. So Uncle Rick, do you think you can open the safe for us? 'Cause he lost the key, and we really need to get in. How the hell'd you fuck that up? You know, she's not gonna put up with that shit. He's just a little unorganized sometimes, my little bo-bo. Sorry for the inconvenience, sir. It's Rick. What the hell's in your safe, anyway? Let me guess: satin bra and panties? No, I'm trying to get into Colorado State and I left my... I left my transfer records in there, I got a big meeting, actually, on Monday, so I'm hoping to get in... For what? I'm trying to study... um, bakery science. Bakery science. Holy shit! I... I've never heard that one before. I mean, for a minute I thought you were gonna say for football. In which case, I was gonna tell you you need to hit the pull-up bar just a little bit more there, pal. Unless you want to be a kicker. You know, back in the day... - What? - Really? Not the story, not right now. - Look... - Don't... 1986, Fiesta Bowl. National TV. About an hour from here, Sun Devil Stadium. It's 10 seconds left, 4th and one at the goal line. I... I'm gonna run a quarterback sneak, and this dickhead, Switzer, jumps off sides, takes me down with a cheap shot... and blows out my ACL. Can we get back to Jon's problem here? - Yeah, yeah... I'm sorry. - About the safe? You know, I might be able to just rip that thing open with my bare hands. You know, I once wrestled a gator down in the Manchac swamp. And I kicked his ass, or his tail, or whatever you want to call it, but I came out without a scratch. That doesn't work, I got a Manchin garage in the back here, full of tools. First thing in the morning, I'll crack that thing open, you guys will be on your way. Promise. Thank you, sir. Sorry, I mean Rick. And you know, I'd love... love to hear more of your stories, they sound really... really fun. No problem there, buddy, I got you covered with those. On that note, I'm gonna show him the backyard. Go on, guys. Make yourselves at home. I'm gonna sit back, get drunk... well, drunker, watch a little football. Hey, go on up, really. Have some tequila, chill... You know, go take your Snapchats, or whatever the hell you guys do. Watch out for the rattlers. And I got a cougar stalking me. She lives next door. Yeah... Cute, though. Are you trying to make me look bad? Bakery science? Really? Where in the hell'd that come from? I just tried to come up with some shit, I don't know... - Weird. - It was your terrible idea to come here. Come on, your uncle, he's not gonna fall for this. You didn't tell me your uncle was Clint Eastwood. Look, Jon, I know where your head's at. Okay? It was an accident. If the roles were reversed, he wouldn't have cared. I just... I just wish I'd confronted him one more time. - He wouldn't have listened. - No, maybe he would have. Look... by the time anything's discovered, okay, we're gonna be all the way in Colorado. It's not even gonna matter. Is this really worse... than going back to having nothing? Well, he was my best friend. I mean, he's all I had. He was my only friend. He was not your best friend! He wasn't even a friend! How can you not see that? He was blatantly ripping you off. I know, I know, I got it, all right? Look, I just... I need some time alone. It's not... it's not you, it's me. Guess what? We're in a dark room, Jon, and we are the light. Are you okay? What's wrong? Yeah, I killed that one by accident. Hey, I'm not interrupting, am I? - No, not at all. - Good. Hey, I mixed you up a little nightcap. Call it "Mother's Milk." Put a little lead in your pencil. Okay. You'll sleep like a baby. It's better if you do it in one big shot. There you go. Well, listen, um... get some sleep. I'll see you guys in the morning. Good night. You know, you had a long day. Why don't you get some rest? I'm gonna go watch some TV with Uncle Rick for a little bit. - All right. - All right? Good luck at Colorado State, Jon. I got your ATM, cracked wide fuckin' open for you. Got your transfer papers on the kitchen table. You're gonna make one hell of a baker with all that dough in there. What did I teach you? Friendship before money, Jon. You never learn. I warned you to listen. They're coming after you now. Soon, everybody in the world will know what you did. Do you feel evil, Jon? Do you?! You drive me crazy, Jon! Evil man! Burn in hell! Hey, you up? I really wanted to let you sleep in, but Rick's been at it all night, and he still can't get that safe open. No dice, amigo. Where the hell did you get this box? My-my friend gave it to me. You know, he said I could use it as a safe. And then it just... It's just a novelty thing, right? Yeah. All right, come here, look. It's got two locks, right? But in between the two, there's some kind of electronic barrier. I mean, this is aftermarket. It's black market, I don't know what the fuck it is, but it's being a bitch to open. Kinda like a few of the women I dated. When the hell's the last time you opened it? Rick. - He doesn't know. Leave him alone. - He doesn't know? - No. - All right. All right, I'll keep busy. You're dead. - Hey, Rick? - Yeah? You got a computer I can use? Yeah, it's in the office. Guest passcode is FU1986. - FU? - Yeah, you know, fuck you. Okay. Jon, what are you doing? I need to find out who that guy was. - And we really need to get going. - The guy at Harvey's shed he was giving money to. I need to find out who he was. Well, I got it. - You got in? - No. But I got an idea. Look, I'm thinking Tombstone. I know this old bastard up there, Doc Seagar. He can open up just about anything. It's gonna cost you a little bit, but... I think it's our best bet. - It's worth a shot. - Yeah. Sure. All right. All right, Traci. Run on in there and get the ball rolling. Why me? Well... Doc Seagar, he likes beautiful women. You know, it ups our chances he might give you a better deal. Yeah, okay. Whatever. Attagirl. Thanks. - Hey, Trace? - Yeah? Don't tell him it's an ATM, all right? - Let me do all the explaining. - Okay. Hello? How long you've been seeing her? A few months now. Few months? Hell, that explains everything. Your dick's been pink steel 24/7, right? And let me guess, you run out, get yourself a little engagement ring, and like a knucklehead you throw it in the safe, lose the key, here you are. Right? Hey, there. What can I do you for, miss? I have a safe that I need help opening. You look familiar. You used to have different hair or something. - You from around here? - No. I'm from out of town, so you must be thinking of someone else. Right... Well, you know what model the safe is? I think it's best we bring it in here. Here? No. Not here. Dad doesn't like any hanky-panky going on in the shop. Doc's orders. Doc Seagar knows my uncle. Rick Stanton? How about you? What are you doing for work? Well, I'm not doing any male stripping, if that's what you were hoping for. Hell, I run my own construction company. I mean, how else do you think I know dirtbags like this guy? Now you listen here. No sticky Stanton, no extracurricular activities. That stuff doesn't go on in here. Dad prefers a private location. Okay. When's the soonest you can come out? - Out where? - To our ranch. - Soon as today, if the money's right. - 00 p.m., I reckon. Just jot down your information here and fork over some cash. If you need an ATM, there's one in town. It's not an issue. Just be there at 4:00. Right. Hey, Uncle Rick, how you doin'? We need your help. We lost the key. It's just a little safe. You can open up that. This whole thing's starting to smell like shit. Jon... You're lying to yourself. You cannot handle truth. Can you fuckin' take that thing off? You know why I make this mask of you, Jon? We both have something in common, Jon. We both survived scary fall. You never tell me about your fall. When exactly did you lose your mom? Remember? You are flying, Jon. What were you feeling? Yeah, I see you as a lemon, man. You were saved by the little tree... Why you trying to destroy yourself, Jon? Do you realize how dangerous lack of human connection, friendship, can be? You surround yourself with strange people, wrong vibration. Heh. Yeah... Tell me about it. Doc Seagar, the living legend. How are you? Not an easy place to find. - Are you on foot? - Always. Listen, kids here, they're from out of town. They've got a little problem. Young lady tells me you've got something giving you trouble. That's right. We've got a box that needs opening. Come on over, I'll show you. Hey, look! It's my ex wife. She had all the money. An ATM. What fun! - What's in it? - Just some of my school documents. Well, you're a smart little bastard, aren't you? - I don't know about this one. - I don't either. Let me check the serial number. Does this have a memory device in it? I have no idea. You know, Doc and I here, we share the same girl down at the massage parlor. He goes first, I get the happy ending. An old ATM model. Something's not right. Serial number only has nine digits. Where'd you get this baby? Beats me. Elaborate little setup, double locks. You don't have a key for either, I presume? - You know, look, we're in a bit of a rush here, we don't have time for 20 questions, we just want it opened. Well, maybe you should find yourself another locksmith, then, one that doesn't mind messing with a stolen ATM. It's not stolen. You're the dudes who knocked off Gus' Liquor the other night, aren't you? For fuck's sake! Maybe you'd like to explain the situation to the Pima County Sheriff. I'll get him on the line for you. God dammit, Doc! You know what? Could you just help us out here? I mean, nobody likes a box they can't open any more than I do, all right? The kids here, they don't want any trouble. You're talkin' to me like you know me. Let's cut the bullshit. I can open this thing but it is going to cost you. Um, here. We don't want any trouble. That's fuckin' chump change! I'm naming the price for this thing. Christ! You're just opening up a lock. But first things first. I'm gonna have to have a whisky over ice. Gotta unwind from my walk. I'll open this thing for you, but after I finish my drink. Man, we'll get right on it. Come on, guys. I oughta stir this thing with my dick. How far are you willing to go trying to get this thing open? You got another grand? You got that kind of coin? Let's just do what we gotta do. All right? Let's just get it open. Vinny! Vinny! You gotta get your ass over here A.S.A.P. We got ourselves a golden goose! Yeah, Sticky Stanton's! All right, get over here! It's not just college transfer papers in there, is it? Look, I don't give a shit what's in it, I just wanna help you guys get it open, all right? Let's go. I feel like kicking him right in the pussy. Let the good times roll! - Here you go. - Let the fun begin! Look, we're gonna give you an added bonus of $1,000 if you can crack it open within the hour. No, no, no no, no! This is gonna take way more than an hour. We have to give this the nitric acid treatment. You just plan to chill out for a while. Nitric acid? Well, shucks. How about I make it 1,500? You guys are awfully anxious to get in there for just a few papers. Value's written all over your faces. You're gonna have to lay 25 grand on me, or this thing is toast. You know what? I'm sick of your shit. I'm tired of you blackmailing us. Give us our money back, and I want your shriveled, geriatric ass off my fucking property. You know, I called a friend over. I hope you don't mind. - Fuck... - Hand it over. Hand it over! Get over here, against the wall. Come on! Get the fuck over here! Faster! Come on! And here he comes. Get back against the wall! Fucker! Eyes forward, come on! What the fuck is this party? Yeah, they brought me this stolen ATM. I can't get it open, they won't tell me what's in it. But I bet you it is a king's ransom! - Whose fuckin' safe is this? - It's mine. Why are you being a little bitch and giving Doc here a hard time? Look, hombre, we just want the damn thing open, all right? I just got some tools in there, that's it. We just need your... Now it's tools you got in there. See that, chica? Do you remember me? What's your name? Um... I'm Miranda. I noticed right away. Your eyes... You're the one. Hey, lay off the girl. Doc... - it's her. - I don't know you. - It's her, Doc. - Shit! I haven't seen you in six years. I promised you, m'hija, your Mom took you from me! I don't know you. I promised I'd kill seven, m'hija. By gun, by hand, by rope, by car, by water, by fire, and finally... by knife! - Dies irae, dies illa... - I don't know you! - Solvet saeclum in favilla...- Get away from me! Teste Satan cum sibylla... Get the fuck back to the wall! Get back there! Do not move. - Come to me my baby! - What're you doing?! Come to me, my baby! Vinny! I told you to open the safe first. You can torture and do your satanic shit after. I know you're fucking in there! I know you're fucking in there! Don't you look at me, goddammit! - Rick! - My God! Ay, ay, ay... I know you're in there, baby. I'm gonna get you. Come on, baby. Come on. Vinny! Vinny! Fuck you! Fuck you! Traci! Trace? Traci? Shit, are you okay? Fuck. Who the hell shot Santa Claus and his elf here? It wasn't you? Shit! Come on, come on, come on, down, Jon. Down. Let's go. Why you trying to destroy yourself, Jon? Why jealousy, hatred, greed? You only attract other people with same emotion, dangerous people. I told you, Jon. I said you couldn't trust her. What really happened with that woman? Did you do anything to her? Did you hurt her? Jon... she was my life. She was everything. Do you understand? Her body was found completely destroyed and tore apart. Her face ruined and slashed. Police doesn't want to hear truth. They call it unsolved crime of the century. They transform Elizabeth into a dark fantasy of Black Dahlia. I transform myself like a phantom of opera. Love and tragedy, Jon. I see it in your eyes. Colorado State, Jon? ATM. College transfer papers, Jon? I don't think you're going to get into Colorado State the way you've been handling this job. You're fucking everything up. Keep your heads down, guys. Traci, not that far down. You know, I hope you know... because of you and your fucking up, we got two fucking bloated bodies out there the javelinas are gonna start chewing on. What do you think about that? You don't give a goddamn, do you? Well, I'll tell you what, I'm holding you responsible for this shit. Jon... You're a fuck-up. This whole ATM thing, it's just fucked. I mean, are you this much of a fuck-up in real life? What does she see in you? Did she find you under a bridge? What a fucking pussy, man. I can hear your heart beating from here. Don't fucking disappoint me. Tomorrow is a big day. We gotta get the fuck out of here alive. Well... if they wanted to kill us, they would've. You know, maybe it's a vendetta against Doc and that black rat of his. Maybe somebody followed him here. Or it could be the drug lords looking out for me. Hell, it could be that crazy cougar lady neighbor friend of mine. She's a pretty good shot. Jon, come here, come here. What about that friend of yours, the guy who gave you the safe? Maybe he had something to do with this. Did he have anybody after him? I don't know. Maybe, yeah. - Maybe? - Maybe. I think there might be. Now listen, Jon, every once in awhile in life, your balls gotta get a little bit bigger. And now's the time. I need you to go out to the garage and get the guns. They're in an army duffel bag, in a box behind the white Impala. Check for ammo, all right? Traci needs this, I need this. We need you. - Army? - Yeah. It's green, it's an army duffel bag. You can do this, all right? It's a one of a kind, and I said yeah, I'm a one of a million too, right? I'm special, I'm unique. My little baby! I can lick it. - Come on. Let's go for spin! How the fuck did Harvey's car get into Rick's garage? What are you talking about? - Did you know about this? - What're you talking about? Harvey's car is in Rick's garage. - Those are Rick's cars. - No, they're not. Now either you tell me the truth, or I'm going to the cops. - That's impossible. - Where the hell is Rick? Speak of the devil and he shall appear. Now you're not going anywhere, pal. And what the fuck were you doing in my shit? What a pain in the ass you are. I've never had this much trouble with anybody else. And you... Come here. Finish packing, baby. Now I know what you're thinking. Did I fuck her five or six times? Well, to tell you the truth, with all that excitement, I forgot. We've been doing this shit for years. I can't tell you how many bodies I got buried up in the hills. Now Jon, I don't really want to have to kill you. But I don't mind. Now here, put these cuffs on. Put 'em on. It looks like your kind of jewelry. Now move. Come on. All right... Pull over. You know, Jon, you could've gone back to being a nobody. But now? You're gonna die like a stray dog in the desert. Then I'm gonna head back to the ranch, I'm gonna burn through that safe now that Doc and that baby burrito of his are out of the way. Traci and I are gonna catch a flight to the Caymans. And I won't have to hear you bitch ever again. Move. Down there, let's go. Right up here. Right there, down. Get on your knees. Nice place to die, Jon? I owe you that much. This is where I take everybody to kill. What did you do with my friend's body? I didn't do anything with your friend's body. He probably washed out to sea. I was just supposed to pick up the car and get it out of there. And nice car, by the way. One of my favorites. Your buddy had good taste. We were then supposed to meet you at the gas station. Get the keys from you and then ditch you. But you and your buddy had a little catfight, started bitchslapping each other and he went skydiving. There's no such thing as love. Jesus, you think Traci loved you? Hell, I was fucking her so hard last night, I thought there was gonna be a headboard homicide. And you were right in the next room. You think she cared? Hell no. But I tell you what... Jesus, Jon, you look like a schoolgirl that's just seen her first pecker. Traci and I do have an understanding about one thing. Life's a lot easier if you don't give a shit. About anything. I learned that after my first kill. My ex-wife. Hell, she deserved it, Jon. Fuck. What a pain in the ass. I mean, she belittled me any time she could about my football career being over. How I wouldn't amount to anything, how I was a loser. We get into it one night, she had a little too much to drink, and she just went too far, so I fucking punched her. Man, it felt good. It felt... right. So I kept punching her. And punching her. Next thing you know, I don't hear that irritating little voice of hers. And when I looked down into that bloodied, battered face of hers, you know what I felt? Peace. Jon, there's no such thing as a hero. In life, you have to fight back. What're you doing, Jonny? What the fuck, Jon? What're you doing? What the fuck's this? For fuck's sake, the karate kid! Go ahead, let me see you. What do you got? Yeah. Hey! This is great. Ooh! What the fuck was that? Jesus Christ! What the hell? Yeah? Yeah, it's Rick Stanton. Yeah, listen, I might be a little late for that flight. I got kinda... hung up here for a minute. What's that? Fuck! I'll do the steak fajitas. Thanks. Fuck! Fuck! You can't run from death, Jon. Nobody can. Although I just might be the exception. Jon... Thank God you're okay. I can explain everything. It was all Rick's idea. He's a pig and you saw that. What else was I supposed to do? I was terrified. I thought we were real. Jon, I love you. It was me you were laughing with, watching movies with. We were happy! Don't you remember that? Don't you want to be happy? We can still go to Colorado. Jon... Where's the safe? Sorry to interrupt you, Jon. She take you for ride. She is biggest scammer ever. Her name is Rachel Brisby, and she run dating scam website "Hot and Horny"... escort, crazy shit, man. You gotta be kidding me. Jon, he's lying. He's so jealous of us, he always has been! That's why he started ripping you off. Jon, please listen. This time, for once. Come on, listen! You believe this crap? Anything's possible! You could Photoshop that shit! She's wanted in three states. He's the reason we're in this mess! Don't you remember? He's the one who tried to kill you. Your decision, Jon. I warn you again. Babe, I'm sorry. Come on, we... we can still make it to Colorado. Somehow you made it back to me. It is fate. Come on. Jon. What're you doing, Jon? Jon! Turn around! Look at me! Are you serious?! After everything we've been through?! What am I supposed to do, just sit here? Jon! Dammit, Jon! I hate you! I fucking hate you! I recreate myself because I cannot deal with pain. So I became Harvey. And Harvey's a man of many faces. He's a seeker of happiness and goodwill. Then I meet you, Jon. All these decades later. And I see lost soul. And I hope to save you. Give you second chance in your life. But you didn't trust me, Jon. Be careful what you wish for. In life, you take what you deserve. Yeah. You have to learn! You cannot hide from life, you have to listen, the music! Well, that's the story. You survive, Jon. Now it's time to face the truth, your truth. You are different. Different is what pushes life forward. Different deserves special gift. So I ask you... what is your dream? What would make you happy? And what did you say, you remember? What did you answer? Well, if you don't remember, I do. You say your mom pass away. You grow up in broken home. And all your life, you searching for your own corner, your own place to call home. Remember? Here, read it. All we need is your signature right here and your dream come true. You know what, he's my best friend and I cannot wait to give him this gift. Yeah. Well, he work very hard. That's his money too.
