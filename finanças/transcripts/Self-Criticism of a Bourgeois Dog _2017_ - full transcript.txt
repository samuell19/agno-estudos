The times of miracles may long have passed or never've been more than a useful lie. However, strange things still happen in this world. Idiot. At first, there's nothing unusual about this story: A man watches a painting. Just what is it that fascinates him so? Maybe the door opening onto a green garden? I'd often told stories about people like Hong. But soon, we'd have to share a story, which I didn't like at all. Lunchbreak? Look, Saint Francis of Assisi! So what? St Francis lived among the poor, spoke to the birds, and always gave away his clothes. Because he was a communist. What an idiot. Look! That cloud looks like a dog! Was it a casual or a prophetic remark? Cause here's the first strangeness you'll have to deal with: I'm a dog. While they were sitting under the olive trees, however, I was still human. After an unproductive morning, I'd gone to the Museum square to watch girls entering and leaving Art Library on a late summer day. What are you doing here? Just some research at Art Library. Working on a new film? Doing some writing. Great! Cause I heard it's become hard for you to find financing! Well, it's always been hard for more radical stuff in Germany. To me, it seems you became less radical. But you've read my review. Perhaps you stepping into narrative wasn't too happy? How did she know I might never make another film? But I didn't have time to think, as I ran into Camille, who I hardly knew, but on whose Facebook profile I'd already spent hours. I had a stupid idea. Self-criticism of a bourgeois dog Of course, there was no film. I lived on welfare, vaguely hoping for a grant to write a new screenplay. I'd just had an appointment at the public employment agency. I hadn't dared to refuse when my caseworker urged me to accept a job as a seasonal farm worker. But in Hong and Sancho's lives an unpleasant turn had occurred, too. During their shift, a Dürer and a fire-extinguisher had disappeared. So they got fired on a Wednesday morning. Sancho's grandfather, a Swiss nudist and esoterist, had left him a pendulum, which suggested they should team up to face destiny. Being sick of wage labour, they decided to try their luck as freelance deposit collectors. The first building stone of our happiness! Finally we're our own masters! But this American dream soon vanished and their future looked uncertain. Today, under the old lime tree in Straubnitz, from 6 a.m. until midnight, staff will be hired for the OKLAHOMA apple plantation! Whoever thinks of his future belongs to us! Whoever misses the chance now misses it forever! Everyone is welcome! Now they force me to work on a fucking plantation, so humiliating! This might be paradise on earth! You'll be a proletarian now! If you tell anyone, I'll kill you! We were going to a party at my old professor's, famous documentary film maker Rudolf Botow. Dear guests, dinner's ready, but first some music, so shut the fuck up! You overambitious couch potatoes! At your age, I had two kids and as a convinced Maoist I worked in a factory, for my re-education! And I fucked, fucked, fucked. Translate! You know what I learnt there? Working class people are the biggest fascists! So you'll get the post as his assistant? Yes, I start next week. Didn't you apply, too? Yes, but I wouldn't have time, anyway. Really? What are you doing? I'll be away for some months. They let you go on holiday though you're on welfare? Who says I'm on welfare? Wasn't it you, bro? Me? No way! Where do you spend your holiday? No, I'm doing research. What research? Well, my... my next project is set on an apple plantation, so I'll work on a farm to investigate the working conditions there. Really? Rudolf, someone's following in your Maoist footsteps! All the wheels stand still when my fat ass declares its will! It was true! I wanted to be a communist, but also to sleep with her. Why'd she taken off her shoes? I'd fallen in love. So, did you make out? Was I a genius or an idiot? Two days later she wrote, she wanted to help me with my "research". Do you smell the apples? It'll be Paradise on earth! Sign here, then. Yes, man was born to work, it's God-given. His trees bear apples, but you still have to pick them yourselves. Lazy buggers would starve even in paradise! Come on! You're holding everyone up with your handicap. What has four eyes, but can't see? What had I got into? Hi comrades! Glad to meet you! These guys look dangerous! Let's first have a nap! I beg you pardon? - When did you start smoking? - Shut up! This might get complicated. No-one was able to tell the Countess how to marry off one's daughters nowadays. Good evening! Join us for a drink? No thanks, I'm tired. The French way of letting parents decide the fate of their children never made its way into Russia. The English way of letting girls decide themselves was not acceptable in Russian society either. And the Russian way of match-making seemed totally absurd. Everyone made fun of it, even the Countess. So no-one really knew how girls would get married... Hail to Princess Sherbasomething, but I need to sleep! Guys! We start early tomorrow, and there'll be no Count Vronsky to court me. - What? - Vronsky wants to sleep. Comrades, please, let's take a democratic vote. One, two, three four, five. Dear employees, let me welcome you all as new members of the Oklahoma family! The apples glow like rubies in the sun, their fragrant scent fills the air, transforming work into joy! Wait a moment, work and fun? How does that fit? We at Oklahoma say: It does! That's why experts in Employee Satisfaction have... developed a playfully motivating competition for you. You'll work in teams of two, competing in a merry picking Olympics. Each week, the team that has harvested the biggest amount of apples will be awarded the golden apple crown. And receive an extra bonus. Now you'll ask yourself: Is it really just a game? And the world market? Right, we still need to be competitive: There's a minimum amount of apples you have to reap in your daily shift. But don't worry: If once you have a weak day, just do some extra rounds at night. Any questions? Will extra rounds be paid? Does this sound logical to you? No... That wouldn't be logical! See? I wish us all a great summer! So, made up your teams yet? I've got to sit down, it's too uncomfortable. You have to work in a logic way. Look how I do it. Nonsense. Let me put it in a parable. On my grandfather's farm, there was this farmhand called Sang-Kyung. He worked the same way as you. Once, at full moon, he was sent out to gather some ferns. So what? It was in May, and the forest smelled of fresh moss. A senseless story. The mountains looked crisp. Well, it's so long ago... I stopped listening! Lazy, old and stupid! How can you ever compete in the world market? Look how they're taking advantage! I understand some German, but I... speak very little. After that humiliating afternoon, I had to put in an effort not to make a fool of myself again. I had brought some wine which once helped getting a scenography intern to kiss me. But I found Camille in unpleasant company. We could speak in tandem. I came with my parents during Korean War to East Germany. Well, I'm not too sure. Would the evening bring a romantic twist? I could certainly use a bonus. I have many wishes! Don't they say: A wish generates ideas? One should break Zurab's leg. That would be criminal. Or an accident. You could push him on the stairs. Impossible! As you wish! Every man is the architect of his happiness! Wake up, lazybones! The week dragged on endlessly and I felt sorry for myself. I wasn't made for physical work, I made no progress with Camille, whose strange enthusiasm seemed to make indifferent to the strains of work. In my dreams of exhaustion she began to resemble the heroine of a Soviet silent film. Saturday, Zurab and I were crowned harvesting kings by Mrs Gottfried. For the hard-working, life's a silver conveyer-belt! Sure. It's all your fault! Next week, I'll work with Zurab. You're blocking my success, useless fool! Much to Zurab's disappointment, the bonus was an Amazon voucher worth 20 Euro, but Sancho still envied him. I was waiting for Sunday to start a romantic attack. One million! That's quite some money! Too bad! One could think it's Paradise on Earth. I wish every day could be as beautiful! Donald Duck. Scrooge makes a good deal. I prefer Donald. He always ends up the fool. That's the difference between you and me. At night, we read Anna Karenina. That's nice. First, they go to Italy, and nobody has to work. Are you poor, too? Why are you here, then? The question is: Why are you here, if you're not poor? I mentally commanded her to kiss me. This is the police. Leave the private property immediately! I repeat: This is private property! Please leave at once! Dear employees, the time has come to prove we're one team, to prove that, together, we're able to defy the storm that has brewed across the Atlantic. Markets were flooded overnight with American apples, prices are collapsing, we have our backs against the wall. We now have to concentrate on what has always been the core values of the Oklahoma family: Our willpower and our solidarity in hard times. "Forward, without forgetting What our strength will always be: Our solidarity!" What was that speech? The reaping requirement will be 100 Kilo more! Who told you that? Was just sent by SMS. Now we're screwed! This world market starts to be a nuisance. I don't care. Next week I'll work with Zurab. But trouble was the last thing I needed. What would my caseworker say? I've never been a socialist, but one thing we did learn in the East: It's us who create surplus value. But profit rattles in Mrs Gottfried's pocket. Please leave Marx on the book shelve. The dust makes me... Exchange value is a tricky thing. Remember my grandpa. A hungry pirate once offered him a Stradivari, in exchange for a goat. My grandfather took the violin, but smashed it on a waiter's skull in solidarity with the October Revolution. Or the other way round. Now, shouldn't he have kept the goat? What about a strike? A reasonable strike is mostly reasonable. Rotting apples will make Gottfried surrender. And we'll work less again! This revolutionary arousal made Camille blush slightly. Was this how she'd look if we slept together? I had to play a double game. Ok, now cut that shit! The boss will just replace you by some other Romanians, or just shut operations here entirely. I say: Keep quiet and keep your job! Yes, Bruno convinced me. A strike would be way too dangerous. Mrs Gottfried doesn't scare me! But she's just a small cog in the wheel! She wouldn't even be admitted to the hallway of the executive board! Any trouble, and we're all screwed! Gottfried included! Just like - this! By invisible hand! Even worse: We'd never get another job! Fate says: Rather not. What's going on? We've caught a thieving immigrant! Are you St Francis of Assisi? But one of his friends? I think he can't speak. Where are you going? Can't ask that to a mute! Right. You have somewhere to go? Guess he got lost. Want to work with us? I tried to avoid this figment. Camille, however, was enchanted, whereas Hong and Sancho were driven to desperation, as he didn't understand wage labour at all. You can't eat the apples! They belong to Mrs Gottfried. You must put them in these boxes, get it? So Mrs Gottfried can sell them. Explain the world market to him. See them workers? If there are too few apples in their boxes, Mrs Gottfried has to fire them, and they all die of starvation. He's got it now. Quite annoying, those saints. No! You must put them into OUR boxes! It's a competition! You'll weaken our motivation! You must forget about your sainthood now! Now he's got it! I have my doubts. Nice work. Ah, Mr Monk! Your first weekly wage! Congratulations! Come on, take it! What a psychopath! This goes against German law! I feel threatened at my workplace! Take it, or you can't buy any commodities. Take it! Can I have half of it? You have to think of us, too! "While the pals of my youth / howl at my miseries." What have you got there? All for yourself? A present for our friends? They'll be delighted! Leave these heavy bags with us, we'll hand them over. You may leave now. At night, Zurab surprised us with cigarettes and lemons. Friends! The moon shines down on our luck! Bless our benefactor, Zurab! Who did he meet secretly at night? Camille? Or might even the monk be her lover? I had to risk a dramatic step. Watch out! Police! Dear employees, my trust in you is seriously undermined. Only by chance a serious crime was uncovered last night. Some malicious Judas has for clays been secretly selling our apples to supposedly Polish black marketeers. A mindless crime by an unscrupulous egoist Was fate about to intervene in my favour? If he doesn't turn himself in I have no choice but to dismiss you all. Of course, the Turk! Did you have any accomplices? He's the illegal worker, if they ask for his papers we're in double trouble. Norman, I won't press charges, if he swears never to show up here again. But criminal immigrationists like him are a threat to society! You must be tired after all this commotion! And there's fresh apple cake and coffee in the hall! Alright. Must admit: All that investigating did exhaust me! And now, get off! Judas! Filthy dog! May the shame of treason haunt you forever! This is criminal trespassing! Isn't anyone calling the police? That's usually done! For anyone with no name, the police usually means trouble. But your name is Anton! And that's the order of things! We live under the rule of law! I have a bad feeling. What if they say we killed her? They'll suspect Mr. Motzen. Me? Good Heavens! Oh my god! I sure wouldn't like that! And if we don't tell anyone? They'll find out! No apple delivery tomorrow, and we're done! We're dealing with the German Police! We could take over the plantation and make a communist collective! Communism? Communism? I'll smash your stupid face! I'm getting all dizzy! Communism is nice, but what does he mean by it? Smells of state socialism! Right, Chink! Communism alright, but first comes socialism, and it's worth shit! A famous writer once dreamt he was lying behind a policeman and a bush walked by, or the other way round. Anyway, he was arrested at breakfast! Was dreadful! My parents were cultivating 47 sorts of beets, then the Party came and said: 1. Collectivization 2. GDR must cultivate the first hardy avocado for socialist manned spaceﬂight. So everything's turned over to avocados, but nothing grows. Gunter from the kolkhoz watches West-TV instead of working, and why should he? So dad calls the Secret Police, hoping for some reward. Meets up with contact “Eugen Onegin” at a restaurant. Gunter gets 10 years, dad nothing but a socialist handshake. I wanted to study concert harp, but was sent to the People's Academy of toilet engineering. Marina says, Zurab shall sit and shut up. Nobody wants his Bolshevism. Either our communism will be hedonistic, anarchistic and democratistic, or she's out. She's had enough of sacrifices! The problem is not communism, but the communists. Cause they want to give orders all the time. Perhaps we can make communism without communists? We'd still have to pick stupid apples. Like Americans saying they'd love Paris without the French. Bullshit! Your kolkhoz means: Nobody works, but you go on your nerves collectively. Great! Some instant Yankee idealism! He should shut up! She's a carpenter and will teach us to build houses. Hurray for roof beams! She also knows how to cultivate potatoes, onions and aubergines. It's easy! I can sharpen scissors! Dear friends, life belongs to us! I'll say something, too. Friends! So? I feel like a blank sheet of paper. So what do we do? I've had enough of assemblies! Dear friends, let's not lose our heads while in shock! You can't just expropriate some international Investment Fund and fantasize yourself into some fabulous middle ages. Besides, no-one amongst us has the skills to run an enterprise like this! Let's face it: none of us is capable of anything! Some idiots against the World Spirit! Let's try to get out of this mess! It's not too late! Let's call the law for help! Long live the Revolution! Long live the Revolution! What's going on here? Why is no-one at work? You monstrosity! Get the fuck off! Go back to where you fucking came from! What's up, morons? Has the sky fallen on your heads? Off to work! Fuck! Back home, I got the unexpected news that I'd get funding to write a script, that I'd get funding to write a script, which put a momentary end to my financial troubles. But the events on the plantation had left me confused. I hoped I could at least make a film out of it. It seems the end of the story. This world is ill-conceived! I'm afraid, yes. No, we can't. Why? We're waiting for the monk. So we're waiting for nothing. We might as well leave. Hey, Monk! We're going back to Berlin. We're going back to Berlin. Come join us! Is he dead? He's praying. For the story to go on. For the story to go on. What will you do in Berlin? That's enough. Nothing will happen anyway! What's up with him? Maybe he can write it down? The birds say: Your prayers have been answered. The birds say: Your prayers have been answered. Get up and go on a pilgrimage to Italy. As you arrive, the revolution will have occurred and communism without communists will make the green of earth glisten once again. Will make the green of earth glisten once again. Italy? And if it's a lie? But he's a saint! And the birds? Yes, birds talk all kinds of stuff. Yes, birds talk all kinds of stuff. I'll ask the pendulum. It's the truth. Let's go. Seems to be a miracle! Seems to be a miracle! She doesn't believe in the revolution. A miracle of beans! One turning into three! A miracle of beans! One turning into three! Long live the revolution! If you keep on lagging behind, we'll never get to communism! In communism without communists, everyone's allowed their own speed! In communism without communists, everyone's allowed their own speed! Or it's not worth a hill of beans! May I ask a question? Please do so. In communism without communists, who always does the stupid tasks? Science! But can science solve all problems? Just think: Who'll clean the public toilets? We might end up fooled just the same. We might end up fooled just the same. Look: Italy has 60 million inhabitants, but only 6000 public toilets. So there's one toilet per 10000 residents. Clean those once a day, and each person needs to clean a public toilet only once every 30 years. Makes sense. Not taking robotic work into account! We've done it! Paradise on earth! Why is she following us? That's her blind spot. But what will we do without the monk? Every revolution requires a sacrifice. They'll put up a memorial to him in Italy. Didn't I tell you? The birds were right! How Communism is beautiful! How Communism is beautiful! Just like in the prophecy! Look at the fields jubilating, freed from the weight of Capital! No private property could ever be as beautiful! No private property could ever be as beautiful! The first Comrade! See, Camille? All of them communists. He's an anarcho-syndicalist, he wears black and red. Let's make sure. Excuse me, Comrade, are you a communist or an anarcho-syndicalist? He feels offended by your suspicion! Why's the terminology so tricky? I suggest we stay here. She just doesn't get it. She just doesn't get it. It belongs to everyone. Which implies some duties. We must make ourselves useful. I'll look after the sheep. I'll set up an anarchistic comic book library. I'll set up an anarchistic comic book library. Not very orthodox, but we will need hard currency to finance the world revolution. We'll build ourselves a cottage here. Everyone will have a room of his own. I'll cook up mussels with trufﬂes every night! The welcoming committee! Get off my property, scum! Get off my property, scum! A misunderstanding. She thinks we're counter-revolutionaries. Seems there's still big landowners refusing collectivization. Man is an enigma. See, Camille? The red ﬂag! Here's the proof: Stalin prohibited Suprematist art, here it's attached to every lamp-post! The food hand-out! Hello Comrade! Long live the revolution! What's that? Are you kidding me? What did he say? You're not a good anarchist! Get off, crook! This is collective property! Watch out, or I call the police! Let them go! Blessed the poor in spirit! Don't you see they're robbing me? What's she saying? The guy from the food hand-out is a little funny in the head. So we hope you get well soon! Almighty! Where's Camille? She must have gone ahead. Where might she have gone? Let's first ask for the allocation of a place to live, then look for her. This is private property, you can't sleep here! Hi dudes, looking for work? Are you thinking what I'm thinking? The birds were lying. Thank God! It was all just a movie! I was beginning to wonder. I'll tell the prison guard. Sir, you must let us go. We're victims of a Bourgeois' self-protective fantasy! Shut up, ill-fated jailbird! I've been with the monk for some weeks now. My punishment has proved to be a blessing. I'm trying to be his worthy pupil. There's still a lot I don't understand, but a dog's more humble. I'm ashamed of my arrogance; I'm ashamed of my treason; I'm ashamed of not trusting others, of just projecting my desires and fears onto them. Now we're digging a tunnel to rescue Hong and Sancho, in order to make a communism without communists together. Perhaps it's not so hard after all?
