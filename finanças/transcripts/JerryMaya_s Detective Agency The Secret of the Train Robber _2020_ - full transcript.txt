Oh no! The food lift, quick! - Hello? - Do you really have to run away, Klara? - I have to help Dad with something. - Isn't he in jail? You have to hurry now, Klara. Quick! What are you doing? Lassemaja's Detective Agency THE TRAIN ROBBER MYSTERY Is something happening? Well—Ivy Roos's dog just pooped. - Did she pick up the poop? - Yes unfortunately. Hang on, look at that guy. - He's heading towards Ivy Roos! - Ivy! Watch out for the thief! It's important to look where you're going. Take care now. - What a nice young man! - What thief should I watch out for? - We—we got it a bit wrong. - My little detectives! Don't judge the dog by its fur. Isn't that right, Carl Philip? We're going home now. - Bye! - Bye. LasseMaja's Detective Agency! It's the Commissioner. Come to the prison, Marzipan's escaped! - OK! Is this thing on? All units to the Valleby Prison. Marzipan has escaped! - Hi, we're from LasseMaja's Detective Agency. - Please come in. Little people! - Nobody knows how he managed to escape. - There you are! Come on. - Stop! Sign the visitor's book. - Yeah, OK. - I—I have a badge. - So I see. Hi. Name and date. - There you go— - Thanks. - And there you go. - Thanks. - This is his cell. Valleby's worst train robber. 4,385,500 kronor he took. - Old banknotes that were going to be destroyed at Valleby Bank. The money was never found. Now Ferdinand Fransson's gone too. - Ferdinand Fransson? So why's he called Marzipan? - Yeah, to make a short story long— The robbery took place between Kristinelund and Valleby. I was guarding the safe. Fransson was a conductor, and that day was my birthday. He gave me a cake with a red marzipan rose. He'd put a sedative in the rose. That's how he came to be called Marzipan. While I was asleep he broke open the safe. He was caught red-handed beside the empty safe by Kristinelund's Chief of Police, Regina. Get him! - I still don't understand how he could have hidden all that money. - "Merry Christmas, Dad, from Klara." Klara Fransson, Marzipan's daughter. She had to move to an orphanage. Isn't that funny? Valleby's worst train robber sitting here playing with trains! - But—there's the prison. - And our detective agency. - Then this must be the police station. I wonder if I'm in there! Yes, but just look! God, how small I am. And fat! Well, everyone knows you put on five kilos in models like this. - Are all roads out of Valleby guarded? - Definitely. There are roadblocks everywhere. Inspector Bengtsson's there, then we have Jansson there— Karlsson, Olsson—she's over here. - What about the train station? Who's watching that? - Nobody. Damn! Double damn! Come on! - Look! Ferdinand trying to get away on the train! - I'll take the front. - I'll take the back. - I'll buy the tickets. Marzipan escaped! Extra! The last train to Kristinelund will depart from platform 1. This is the first call. STAFF ROOM One adult to Kristinelund. - Five kronor. It flew out. There. - Hello. - Use the microphone! Three tickets to Kristinelund, please. Two children and one adult—child. - Stressed? - Exactly. I'm chasing a thief, you see— The last train to Kristinelund will depart from platform 1. This is the second call. Lasse! Quick! Come on! - Have you seen Ferdinand? - No, nowhere. Where's the Commissioner? Please. Just give me three tickets— The last train to Kristinelund will depart from platform 1. This is the last call. If you're in a hurry, please run! - Ferdinand must be on the train. No no no! Stop! Stop the train! Stop! Hello! Hello! Stop! Stop! The coffee cashbox! It's been stolen! We're looking for someone in prison clothes. - Have you got your tickets? The Commissioner was buying them, but he missed the train. - Well. You'll have to buy tickets in Kristinelund. - Yes absolutely. - We promise. It's in the newspaper— - What rhymes with cat—? Commissioner, we're on the train. Where are you? - In the car. I'm right behind you. Ferdinand took the cashbox from the staff room. - Received. Hurry up! - I'm on my way, everything's under control. - Hello? Commissioner? Are you there? Doesn't he sound strange. Oh poop! Two cakes. Bloody kids! Hi! Do you know how to get to the engine? - Yes, I'm the driver. - What? So who's driving the train? - It's running on autopilot. - Hold it! Hi, children. - Hello. - What about your tickets? - We'll buy them in Kristinelund. - The other conductor let us. - The other conductor? I'm the only conductor on the train. Oh sorry! I'm so sorry! What a rotten driver! - Come on. Commissioner. Are you there? Ferdinand's dressed as a conductor. Commissioner? - Yes, understood. I'll alert the police in Kristinelund. Over and out. Shall we go and grab Marzipan? - Shut your piehole and sit down. Commissioner to Regina, come in. Ferdinand's the conductor. On my way. Out. - Hold tight now, we're moving. - I don't have to hold tight. Stop the train immediately! You have Marzipan on board. Check the whole train and all passengers. - Ferdinand is disguised as a conductor. - A conductor? - Yes, a conductor. A train uniform with a hat on his head. - Yes— - And be careful. Marzipan is a cunning criminal. Get a move on! - He doesn't fool me that easily. Scarf—cap—fringe— Beret— Conductor! Take it easy! Nobody plays the hero here. Hands in the air, the game's up! - No, That's the Commissioner. - What's that smell? - It's him. - It's a long story. These are my co-workers from LasseMaja's Detective Agency. - Ferdinand's dressed as a conductor, but he's not on the train. We've looked everywhere. - Randolf! Children shouldn't be playing detective. Children should be at school. - But we work very well together. I have a direct phone to their office. - A direct phone? - Yes! - That's totally inappropriate. Children should not be involved in police matters. Children are short. And easily fooled. Children, your brains are not fully developed. That comes with age. Maybe not for everyone—maybe. Randolf, I demand that you cancel this so-called co-operation immediately. - But— - No buts! Do as I say. - Look, here's all the evidence. - We should have that! - You can carry this cute little train set. It's going to be fun to play with, isn't it? Choo choo choo! Here comes the train! Come on, Kimmy, let's go. - That was good! Choo choo choo! Here comes the train! Heading out over our land— Choo choo— I'm terribly sorry, but Regina's my boss. I may as well take this. See you later. "Children are short and easily fooled." Police Jackass! Hello?! Would you stop playing? Bye, handcuffs. Bye, detective agency. Who is it? - Klara Fransson? - Marzipan's daughter? - Don't call the police. I've got something to tell you. - Okay, what did you want to say? - Dad isn't Marzipan. - We're not complete suckers. - He gave the Commissioner the cake. - And was caught red-handed. - I know he's innocent! I got this a few days ago. "Dear Klara. Don't worry now, but I'm going to escape from here on Friday. " I'll go to the train station to find evidence. I'll expose Marzipan. That's our only chance to be together again. Millions of hugs. "Dad." Dad is not a train robber. And now he's gone. Please help me find him. You're the best detectives in town. What if Klara's Dad really is innocent. - Or he's just lying. - I wonder what Ferdinand's proof is. This is our chance, Lasse. We'll find the truth about Marzipan. - But—our agency's shut down. We have to call the Commissioner. - We don't have to. We'll show that stupid cop. She's the one who's easily fooled. Not us! - But what if Ferdinand's guilty after all? What do we do then? - Then we arrest him and cuff him. You in? - Absolutely! We've decided. - We'll find your Dad. - Thanks! Thank you very much! Are you sure he was on the train? - Yes, dressed up as a conductor. But when Regina stopped the train he'd just vanished. Wait—Lasse—you got the stains on your shirt when the train slowed down. I'm sorry! Near this house! Humlebo. - Yeah! That's where the train slowed down. Ferdinand must have pulled the emergency brake and jumped off the train! - Maybe he's hiding there! You haven't packed much! A full cart! You going on a camping holiday? Dad! Are you here? - Klara! Someone might hear us. - Yes—Dad, for example. - Or the police! Our investigation's actually secret. I can see something over there. I used to ride on one of these with Dad when I was little. We went a long way into the woods. Then we slept in an old wagon. - Can you remember where it was? - No. But it was super cosy. - What do you think? - Might be worth a look. Careful, Klara. How do you brake? - Brake! - I don't know how to! There's a dip! - What? What dip?! Is everyone okay? - Yes. Where are we? - I've been here before. I'm getting my own cat this summer. One that's completely black. I'm going to call it Sotis. - Like on the necklace? - Dad made it in prison. - Pretty. - By the summer holidays, we'll be free and we'll just play and be with Sotis. When he gets free, and everything. What was that? Maja! Wait for me. Dad? - Police? Ferdinand's here. North of the train tunnel, come quick! Klara? - Dad! - Klara— Is it really you? But how—how did you find me? - LasseMaja's Detective Agency. So you hunt thieves? - Yes, it happens. Train robbers, for example. Klara says you're innocent. - Do you have any proof? - I have something that might interest you. Follow me. Do you need help? - Yes thanks. - You too? - No thanks. - The coffee cashbox. - Open it, then you'll see. - Old banknotes. - That's the money from the train robbery. The cashbox was in the station staff room. Marzipan must have mended the banknotes with the red tape and paid with them. - And you were in jail then, weren't you Dad? - This proves I'm innocent. I've gone through that day many times trying to understand what happened. - Tell us. Take it from the beginning. - We had just moved to Valleby. I got a job as a conductor. Ivar taught me all about the profession. How to make small talk with passengers— to make sure everyone is in a good mood. Sometimes Klara came to work with me. Everything was so perfect. Until that day. Ivar had flu, so I was alone for the first time. Everyone was a little tense. There was a safe containing 4,385,500 kronor in the wagon. It was the Commissioner's birthday, so we surprised him with cake. I kept him company. Suddenly I got so tired. Everything was spinning. I can't remember anything after that. - So were you drugged as well? - Same as the Commissioner? - There was a sedative in the marzipan rose. While the Commissioner and I were asleep Marzipan emptied the safe. I got a long prison sentence, even though I was innocent. I haven't done anything, I swear! Klara was forced to live in an orphanage. - Dad !! Please, you must believe me. I'm not Marzipan. - I believe you. All units to Valleby woods. A witness saw Marzipan north of the train tunnel. - I'm sorry. I was so scared. Lasse, look. You. Check that car. Properly! - Yeah Yeah. Stop the car! Turn off the engine. Get out of the car. Yes, come out. You have to be completely still now. Police check. - What if they find us, Dad? - Just lie still. Stand to the right, completely still. - This is the moment, Maja. - Are there more people in the car? - The Child Detectives! What are you doing here in the forest? Children shouldn't be out so late. - Hey, kids! - A little fresh air never hurt anyone. - Exactly! But we ought to be getting home now. - Stop! What have you got in the cart? - Nothing. Just—stuff. What kind of stuff? - Disgusting stuff. Poop, actually. - Poop? - Exactly. We're collecting poop. Hare poop, cow poop, beaver poop. It's a school assignment. - Oh come on, are you for real? Did you think they'd have Marzipan in the cart? Are you completely mental? - Yes. - They're just simple poop detectives. - Are they? - Yes, they are. And that means that—you—Randolf— you're just a little—poop-commissioner. - Yes! You can go, ride on! - Thanks. - Go and check the car now. - Yes, I'll do that. What the hell—abuse of a public official! - But—they're just balloons. - That came straight at me! Are you a clown? - Yes. So Marzipan is still working at the station? The coffee cashbox is in the staff room. Someone must have put the money from the robbery in it. My old photo. All these people worked at the station when the train was robbed. - So one of these is the real robber? - Who are still working at the station today? All of them are under suspicion. - Ivar should know more. The conductor. He could certainly help. - The conductor? But if he's still there, he's our prime suspect. - Ivar? No, hardly. He was at home with flu. You can't rob a train you're not on. - Wait for me! - Klara. No. No, okay? - I want to come with you, Dad. I know everywhere at the station. - OK. But be careful. - And you stay here, Dad. Don't go somewhere people might see you. Promise! - I promise. - Let's go. Thanks for the coffee. So so so, good good good At Ivar's, the coffee's freshly brewed! Well! Hello, kids! A glass of lemonade? We're from LasseMaja's Detective Agency. We need help with something. - Klara? - Can we go in and talk a minute? - Of course. Come inside. - Cosy! - Yes, crowded—and cosy, you could say. I moved into this old station inspector's house 35 years ago. Yes, a whole life at the station. But with my bad back I don't know how it'll turn out. I want to retire. But there's no new conductor. Ferdinand was going to take over. But that didn't happen. Anyway, what is it you want help with? - Finding Marzipan. - Dad's innocent. I've always known that. Let's see: We have Sixten, the train driver. And there we have Sören, the cleaner. They're still here. Kakan, with her pastries, she's still here too. So there are one, two, three suspects. Except for me, of course. I'm so sorry for your Dad, Klara. Do you know where he is now? In a safe hiding place. Lasse and Maja have fixed everything. - Bye then, Ivar! - Thanks for the lemonade. Look! - The station orchestra? What about it? - Can't you see the red tape? Same tape as on the banknotes. - Marzipan put up the poster! - And is in the orchestra! Hello Hello! Don't miss our eminent railway quartet— who are giving a lunchtime recital at the engine shed. Four musicians. One of them must be Marzipan. - What? All three suspects are there. - Plus Ivar. Suspect number one: The driver. - But he drives the train. He couldn't very well empty a safe? - Yes he could. He just puts the train on autopilot then it runs by itself. Clearly a suspect. Suspect number two: The cleaner. - Wallets that were in the train's cleaning trolley. - These might be things people have left behind. - Or stolen goods. - Clearly a suspect. - Suspect number three: Kakan. Who baked the cake with the marzipan rose. - Clearly a suspect. - But which of them is Marzipan? - We need more proof. - I know! There's a practice room. Maybe there'll be something there. - Yes! Good idea! Thanks! I love you! I love you! If you only knew how much I love you! I love you! Yes! What if the money from the robbery is here? PRACTICE ROOM Nothing in the lockers. No evidence anywhere. - Here! We haven't looked in this locker. - A seven-digit combination. That's impossible. - But what if the money's in here? - 4,385,500 kronor. You can't imagine how many banknotes that is. - Say the numbers again, Lasse. - 4 million, 385 thousand, 500 kronor. - You're joking! - It must be Marzipan's cabinet. Who else would cloose those numbers? - No money. - But it could be evidence. What's Marzipan going to do with all this other stuff? - Maybe he likes tennis and supports Valleby's football team. - I know! We'll ask Dad. He supports Valleby's football team too. - Smart! Good idea! Dad? Dad! He's not here! What if the police have taken him! - We'd have heard it on the police radio. The coffee cashbox is gone too. But—Klara, he probably just found a new hiding place. - Then why didn't he even write a note? - Maybe he didn't want to leave any traces. - We're close now, Klara. And we have Marzipan's stuff, haven't we? Marzipan's stuff— - I've got it! We try the shoe on all three suspects. The one that is the right size is the Marzipan! - Operation Cinderella. Super easy! Don't you have a job to take care of? I asked you to measure— - Klara, put up the hood. The police are here! What are they doing? - No clue. Come on now! That's it, neat. Now down, then back. Back, back! Quick! Maja! Lasse! Hi! - Hello. What are you doing here? - We're practising for a valuable transport. There's a safe coming from Kristinelund with 18 million kronor. Everything's top secret. I shouldn't tell you we suspect Ferdinand intends to strike again. Yes. He 's still on the loose. - Everyone's lazy! - Now I have to hurry. See you soon—I hope, yes? - Operation Cinderella. Shall we get started? - Yes. Foot massage here! - Oh really? What does it cost, then? - It's free, actually. A service from the train company. Relationship-building measures. - Yes, right, let's give it a go. - Close your eyes and enjoy. - Thank you very much. Thanks! - You're welcome. Just because my name is Kakan doesn't mean my feet smell of it. - The shoe! Feet too big. Feet too small. Only the driver left. He has to be Marzipan. Use your strength. Use your strength. Fight now. - It's not possible. - The shoe doesn't fit anyone. - Have we got this completely wrong? - No! There's one suspect left. Who has size 41.5? Who supports Valleby football team? And who disappeared with the coffee cashbox yesterday? Don't you understand? It's Dad! Why do you think he ran away from the office? To collect his money, of course! And now he's left me. - Sorry. - Sorry for everything! - Klara, where are you going? - Wait! - Well hello! Look what the cat dragged in. Klara Fransson. Welcome. - Where are you taking her? - Straight to the orphanage. - Klara! - Move! That's it! Today I have one Fransson behind bars. Tomorrow I'll have two. Drive! There's something not right. Poor Klara. Someone forgot his umbrella. - We should hand it in to Lost Property. - Yes, come on. Microphone! Lost Property. ID, please! Only employees of the company are allowed in there. - But I've worked here for 19 years. - So what? Rules are rules. There! Yes. LOST PROPERTY It's working! - Lasse, let's go! - Hello? Hello there! The stuff in Marzipan's locker! - Shoe, tennis racket, scarf— - All of them are lost items. Marzipan's accumulated them to get into Lost Property. - But why? - There must be something in there. Some evidence, or something. - But how do we get in? We don't work here. - Ivar! Ivar works here. He might be able to help us. - Good idea! - Hello. Do you know where Ivar is? - Ivar? He's off sick, at home. It must have been an ear infection, or something. - Thanks. - Bye! - Lasse, I have an idea! It may not be completely legal, but— Can you mix cement? One two Three! Five times three hun— That's forbidden! That—that's really forbidden! The red tape! Maja, come on! "Do not open." We need a—a— - Screwdriver! A safe! - The money from the robbery. - It was hidden here all the time. What's this? "Visiting pass for prisoner Ferdinand Fransson, on Friday at 2.15." - So Marzipan must have visited the prison. Then Ferdinand's innocent. He can't visit himself. - I knew it! Marzipan's real name must be in the visitor's book. - We're getting close now. Hi, we need to come in. - Absolutely not. - We're from LasseMaja's Detective Agen— Hello? - Hello! Open up, please! - It's impossible, Maja. - If Ferdinand could escape out, we have to be able to escape in. - Thunder and party. - Go on through. - It's a party. Okay. It's heavy today. Gravity— We're in! - What have I done with my glasses? Did I put them in the cart? - Oh no! He'll look in the cart. - Reading glasses. One must be able to see. One must be able to see the truth, right? Spectacles— There we go. Now I can see better. - Sorry! - This is thunder. There will be a party— - Come on! Watch your step! - The visitor's book! Got it! Mother—? What the hell—? Phone home? Come on. I'm sorry I gave him your glasses. - It's all right, I've got a spare pair. - OK. Can I have the visitor badge? Thanks. - What day did Marzipan visit the prison? - Friday 23rd, at 2.15 pm. Here. What? Now I don't understand anything. Hello! I'm here now! Well. So you've been engaged in a secret investigation all this time? - Sorry we didn't say anything. - Yes Yes. But now you have to tell me: Who is Marzipan? - Marzipan hid in a packing crate in the freight wagon. - That's why you didn't see anything. When you and Ferdinand had fallen asleep the thief came out. - Then Marzipan switched the safes. - Marzipan replaced the real safe with an empty one. Then he put the sleeping Ferdinand in front of the empty safe. Then he screwed himself in with the real safe that had all the money. - But—what happened to the crate then? - The packing crate was unloaded on to the platform. But since it didn't have any delivery address it was sent to Lost Property. That's where the crate's been standing ever since. - Tell me now: Who is Marzipan? - We found a visiting pemit inside the safe. Here. - "Ivar Gyllenkrok." But—isn't he the nice conductor? He was off sick. He wasn't even on the train. - He called in sick so no one would suspect him. - But he hid in the crate. Did you tell Klara I'm hiding here? - Yes. She sends her greetings. - Thank you for coming to the detective agency to warn me about the police. You're a true friend, Ivar. - Shall we go? - Where? - A new hiding place. Much better. Yes. Let's go and arrest him at once. - No no no. We have no fingerprints, no witnesses, nothing. - No evidence. - Oh dear. This isn't good. We all thougnt he'd strike again. - A cash transport of 18 million kronor from Kristinelund. - Ivar has reported sick. - Just like last time. He's going to strike again! - Now we'll catch him red-handed. Packed lunch? Marzipan cake? - Yes, dessert. For later. - Where are we going? - Kristinelund. Hurry, hurry, hurry! Safe! Safe deposit box! Safe! Safe deposit box! Hurry, hurry, hurry! - LasseMaja, come in. - We're on our way to Valleby station. - Received. Everything's going as planned. The train is leaving soon. The safe is in place. Randolf! What are you doing? You're supposed to be keeping watch on the train! - Yes, Chief! - Do it then! Immediately! - Received. Now? - Immediately, I said! Try to stay awake this time! There's 18 million in the safe, okay? - Wakey, wakey. What idiots— LasseMaja, come in. - We're here. - Good. We're arriving in Valleby now. Hope we've thought this through properly. Look, Mum! Here comes the train. What ?! The money's gone? The money's gone! - Time to act. - Hello. We know where the robber is. - Do you? - Marzipan is hiding in that crate. - And how do you know that? Get him! Now! Hello! He's actually innocent! - Wait! Marzipan is in the packing crate! We have proof! - Get out of here, otherwise you'll end up in the nick too. Yes. What are we going to do now, Maja? - The packing crate is our last chance. The crate. It's gone. Lasse! Maja! That's our proof. - What do you mean? - That Ferdinand's innocent. - That's the craziest thing ever. - The real Marzipan is in the packing crate. - Yeah yeah. Open the crate! If only to prove children can't be detectives. - This one, yeah? - Yes. - Are we absolutely sure Ivar is in there? Well? Is the money there? Open the safe! Hat off. Not you! Ivar Gyllenkrok? The kind conductor? And another safe? Now I don't understand anything. - There you are: the real Marzipan. Along with your 18 million kronor. - He did the same as in the previous robbery: He switched the safes. Ferdinand Fransson. You're a free man. And you, Ivar. You are— an unfree man. Ivar. It was you? - You didn't think so, did you? That old Ivar, with his bad back, could pull this off. - No, because you're my friend. But why? - It wasn't for the money. Well, only a little. You'd have taken my job! Moved into the conductor's house. I— I'd have to retire, move to the nursing home, lose everything. Who—who would I drink coffee with in the mornings? The train passengers are my only friends. The station—my life. - I thought you wanted to retire. - I didn't dare say anything. I 'd already been thanked, given flowers— I'd stopped working. But I didn't want to grow old—alone. Sorry! I don't want to be Marzipan anymore. You feel happy, but not really happy. There's one thing left to do, yeah? Dad! Have you started? Yes, welcome to the press conference at LasseMaja's Detective Agency. Following the capture of the real Marzipan and all that. I'm your new reporter for Sigge Jansson, The guy who did it before's been laid off. Lasse and Maja are over there. I'll see if I can get a question in. Are you ready? Yes? Well, I was wondering— everyone thought it was Ferdinand, the whole time. How were you able to think completely differently and guess right? - Don't judge a dog by its fur. That's an important principle for us detectives. Yes. What he means is you have a dog— and just because it has hair, and so on, then you shouldn't judge it. It may not have had hair—at first. - What are you doing here? Do you have any comments on all this? - Yes I have. I would like to say that these two child detectives are absolutely world class. And your brains are—highly developed. And I'm so happy and proud to be able to offer work in Kristinelund. You will have your own workspace, and magnifying glass with built-in GPS. - So come along—welcome! - Thanks very much, but no, thank you. We're fine here in Valleby. - Here you are. - Thanks. The llama's escaping! - Transmit! Transmit! English subtitles by faxeholm1234 and jeremys TNT 2023
