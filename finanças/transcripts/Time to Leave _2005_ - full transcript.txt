TIME TO LEAVE Almost ready? We need another half-hour. - Hair? - Five minutes. Look at this, Romain. - We've got to try it. - Hideous. It's an important... I won't photograph that crap! Romain, let me introduce you. Check the light again. Come in. Hi, Doctor. Please have a seat. So... How do you feel? How were the tests? A bit painful, but I expected worse. I feel better now. I called you in because I have your results. I'm afraid it's bad news. Do I have AIDS? It's not AIDS. You have a tumor, a malignant tumor. Cancer? A type of cancer, yes. The lesions on my liver and lungs? They're part of the same illness. What does that mean? The cancer has spread? Yes, metastasized. We'll do our utmost to cure you. But I'll be honest, the tumor may well resist treatment and continue developing. Can't it be removed? When a tumor develops in several organs at once, it can't be operated on. We weren't able to locate the primary tumor, the starting point, if you like. What's the treatment? Perfusion therapy, radiation. By perfusion therapy you mean chemotherapy, don't you? That's out of the question. A friend of my parents died of cancer to years ago. He lost his hair, his appetite, he suffered... We must avoid comparisons. Each patient reacts differently. What are my chances? They're slim, but they exist. You're 31, you'll fight. When you say slim, do you mean 50% or 5%? It's 5%, is that it? In that ballpark, yes. Not less than 5%? Unfortunately, it is. Without treatment, how long have I got? It's hard to say. We can only talk averages. In a case like yours, three months. But it could be a month, or a year. I don't see the point of chemotherapy. It won't work anyway. I won't judge you. But you're young. I'd like you to fight. Even a slim chance is worth taking. But the decision is yours. I will respect whatever you decide. You land in Tokyo in the morning. The Vogue shoot is at to. The swimsuit spread. Then you've got a train to Kyoto. Romain, are you listening? Yeah. You sure you want to go? Of course. Why do you ask? I don't know. You seem strange lately. Disconnected from everything. I'm fine, don't worry. Maybe you should take a vacation, recharge your batteries. Wasn't this important for my career? Big money and everything? Yes, but not if you mess up. You think I'll mess up? Sometimes we have to say no, for our reputation. You hired someone else? No. I did speak to Jean-Baptiste. He's willing to go. He can fuck himself. I'm going to Japan. I want to tell you I love you, and I'm very ill. I'm going to die. Romain, dinner's ready! Be right there. Why'd you lock me out? You never used to. Those days are over. - I've got a favor to ask. - What now? Be nice to your sister. She and Alain are having problems. Don't worry. It's none of my business, but, you know, your indifference hurts your sister. You never call her. You're repeating yourself. Just make an effort. - Alright, fine. - Thank you. - See how he's grown? - Yeah, he's adorable. Too cute. - A spitting image. - Of who? - Romain. They have the same nose. - It's Alain's nose. Tempted to have one? - Stop it, Mom. - What? Aren't to grandchildren enough? You know your mother. She's so maternal. But Romain has always loved children. Right, honey? Too bad your son's a fag! No descendants on my side. I'm sure in a few years they'll let gays adopt. Let's eat, I'm starving. We sign next week, if all goes well. I'm sure it will. I can't help stressing. This guy's a hard sell. I'm not worried about you. What's new with you, Romain? Nothing much. - How's work? - Fine. Is Japan cancelled? Yeah. It wasn't a great job, and I have work in Paris. What a shame though. I would've loved to go. You weren't invited. Sadly, I don't have your talent. Our photographer has never photographed my children! That's right! Also, I'd love a portrait of Dad and I. Like in that English magazine you showed us. That would be fun. Save your breath, Mom. We're not hip enough. - He prefers actresses and models. - Don't say that. He just hasn't had time yet. Of course. No, she's right. Why do you say that? I don't want to photograph her kids. Romain, please. Leave it, Dad. And you know why? Because they sprang from you. And your ugly mug would be in the picture, it makes me want to puke. Romain, stop it! No wonder your man left. It's like you made the kids alone. I'm gonna kill him! Stop it, Sophie! - You too, Romain. - She's insane! Romain, honestly! Can't you see she's unhappy? She's fragile, you know. I'm fragile too. I've never seen you behave this way. Dad, take me home, I'm drunk. Please. I broke my glasses. How are things with Sasha? Not bad, not great. - We'll probably break up soon. - Shit! Why? Like in all couples, routine is killing desire. - Is he still living with you? - Yeah, he lost his job, he's broke. If he needs a place, there's your aunt's studio. - The rent is low. - Thanks. What the hell did you buy? - Just a little coke. - I thought you quit! Mellow out, it's just occasional. It helps me get it up. - Bye. - Listen, Romain... What? Be good, for your mother's sake. What about for your sake? For my sake, too. So why do you always talk about Mom, and her feelings? As if you didn't have any? I don't know. Habit. It's a shame, isn't it? Maybe I never learned to talk about myself. I've always wanted to ask you something. Why didn't you and Mom ever divorce? Because we love each other. But you cheated on her, many times. So? I don't know. I remember waking up one night as a kid, and you were arguing in the kitchen. Mom had found a letter, and she was crying. You weren't consoling her. I always thought you'd separate. Well, we're still together. Do you regret it? No, I don't regret it. Why should I? Is this about you and Sasha? Yeah, maybe. Do I frighten you? Sometimes, yes. Bye, son. Hi. Still playing those stupid games? You're not telve anymore. - Where were you? - At my parents. - How was it? - The usual. Here. You don't love me anymore. I don't know. I don't love you anymore either. Don't play with me. I'm not playing, I'm telling you the truth. I don't feel anything anymore. Just a vague sense of desire. Occasionally a little affection. Why are you telling me this now? Because... It's good to tell the truth, isn't it? Don't tell me it hurts, I won't believe you. Want to break up? Want me to leave? Yes. Where will I go? What will I do? I don't care, I just want you gone. What's wrong? I've never seen you this way. I'm sick of this fucked-up situation. You're living off me. Who do you think you are? Like you're so great, with your crap photos! - Arrogant bastard! - I don't need you to live. Take your things and get out! OK, you're stronger, happy? Go ahead, kill me. Asshole. Forgive me... - Have you finished? - Yes. Thanks. - It's not too busy today. - No, it's quiet. Do you work here every day? Sure, five days a week. Tomorrow it's my weekend. Cool. Going home? No, I'm going to see my grandmother. Is she sick? - She's in great shape. - Sorry! Yeah, we usually visit when they're dying. I just want to tell her I love her. That's nice. I'm not a nice person. Do you have children? Excuse me? I was just curious. No, no children. Single and childless? That's right. Mademoiselle! Excuse me. You should tell your parents. I tried, but I couldn't. Why not? I don't think anyone wants to hear it. Mom will smother me even more, and Dad will disappear. I think I like it that nobody knows. Imagining their faces. Have you thought about the regret and guilt they'll feel? Yeah, sure. But, oh well, I won't be around to see it. That is infantile and selfish. Here, give me a hand. You haven't finished. I'm full, but it was delicious. Make an effort, you need to eat. - Is that allowed? - I do what I want now. Can I have one? So, who have you told? No one. Just you. Friends, colleagues? Nobody at all. I told them I needed a vacation. What about your sister? You're crazy, no way. She'd get off on babying me, like she does her kids. So? There's no shame in that. It would be a chance for you to to talk. I don't want to. Not with her. And Sasha? No, I couldn't. So why did you tell me? Because you're like me, you'll be dying soon. Did you take your pills? That reminds me, I need to prepare my vitamins. Oh, darn! We forgot to take our walk in the woods. We'll go tomorrow morning. Never mind. I just wanted to see the old tree-house. Parts of it are still there. Look at all the pills I take. This one's an anti-oxidant, this one's for the skin, this one's for hair, this one prevents osteoporosis, a little DHEA, this is an omega of some kind. With all this, I'll die in perfect health. - Don't be silly! - It's true. You know what, Romain? Tonight, I'd like to slip away with you. I don't know what to do, I don't know what's right. I'm following my instincts. After your grandfather died, I was devastated, I thought I was going to die. So I left, I ran away. I abandoned my child, your father. I couldn't take care of him anymore. I'd see Jacques in his smile, in his eyes. They called me a bad mother, a whore even. Your father never forgave me. But I know I was right. If I hadn't left, if I hadn't had all those lovers, I would have died too. You can call it selfish, but it was a survival instinct. Why are you telling me this? Because we're the same. Hello, madame, do you have anything to eat? - Why? - I haven't eaten in days. I'm very poor. But I never invited you! Hey, Romain, come see. What? Look. A bunny! - Why isn't he moving? - He must be sick. Can I take him home and fix him? There's no point, and you might catch a disease. - Please, Daddy? - I said no. Put him down. But he might get eaten! It's nature's way, Romain. Let's go. Come on! Did I wake you? What's the matter? Can't you sleep? No, impossible. Want to talk? No, just sleep with you. You know I sleep naked? That's OK, I won't look. I'm ready to go. - Sure you won't stay for lunch? - I'm not hungry. If you get tired, pull over and rest. I will. These are for you. I picked them early this morning. For my funeral? If you don't want them, toss them. I love you. Me, too. Don't cry, it'll make it too hard. - Romain? - Yes? Couldn't you just try chemotherapy, for me? - It won't work. - You never know. There could be... - A miracle? - Yes. You don't believe that. But I believe in you. You're sweet. I wish we'd met sooner, I'd have married you. - Where will you be? - At my place. Will you call me? I want to take your picture. Seven euros, please. Thank you, have a nice day. - Recognize me? - Of course. May I sit down? Sure. I work across the street, I came to see my husband. We'd like to ask you something. The thing is... My husband has a problem. He's sterile. And? And... We both think you're really handsome. I mean... We wanted to ask you if you'd be willing... to sleep with me. Since you're young we thought you might not mind. He's fine with it. You don't have AIDS? We can try if you want. We've saved some money, we can pay you. That won't be necessary. You don't want to? No, I don't like children. Romain. I'm out of your way. I took all my stuff. Bye. Sasha It's strange, I'm dreaming a lot. The last one was about you. We slept together. It was both sweet and sexual. It felt good. It's funny, you're not my type at all. In my dreams I'll sleep with anyone. My father, my mother... even myself as a child. Guess I'm trying to do it all before I die. They say time heals everything. But in our case it doesn't seem to. You've been particularly aggressive and nasty to me lately. I've tried to understand you. I've tried to make peace. Perhaps awkwardly. But I've tried. I don't understand what it is about me that bothers you so. I often reminisce about our childhood. I remember how close we were. How we would bicker and play. I remember the love we shared. I miss it so much. I hope to hear from you. I've made the first move. Now it's up to you. Your sister who loves you. Sophie Hi. It's me. It's strange to hear your voice. I wanted to tell you I got your letter. And? I suppose you found it ridiculous. I was touched by it. It made me feel good. I'm glad. You know. Sophie. I'd love to see you. But I'm not up to it right now. Working too hard? Yeah. I understand. But I'm happy you called. I just wanted to tell you it isn't you. I'm going through a weird time. I've been acting out. Don't feel bad. OK. - I'll let you go. - OK. Call if you want to see the kids. OK. But I want to see you, not your kids. Kisses. I'll wait to hear from you. K sss Thank you. Romain. In the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. Amen. Our Father, who art in Heaven, hallowed be Thy Name. Thy Kingdom come, Thy will be done, on earth... - We're too little. - Let's get a chair. Been waiting long? No, I just got here. You look exhausted, are you OK? You should get some sun. How are you? Good. They hired me. That's great. I'm happy. And it's thanks to you. Not at all. Yes, it is. I found out you called on my behalf. Well, if you know... But they hired you because you're qualified. I heard you've stopped working? Yeah, I needed to take a breather... And you met someone. Why do you say that? I know you. Incapable of being alone. Do I know him? How old is he? My age. Good, that's what you need. Have you met anyone? Nothing serious. Just one-night stands. It's what I need right now. No complications! See you around. - Call me? - Sure. Actually, no. Why do you say that? What's the matter? Are you feeling alright? I have something to tell you. What? It's not easy. Will you walk me home? Want some vodka? - Drinking in the daytime now? - Occasionally. OK, vodka. So? So... I miss you. Oh, really? It's a bit late now, isn't it? I know. But I want to ask you something. What? I want to make love with you one last time. I want to touch you, smell your skin. I don't feel like it. Do I turn you off now? I don't feel like it anymore. It's over. Just once, one last time. What's the point? Funny you should say that. I keep saying it myself lately. The question is stuck in my brain. Except today, I hadn't thought of it yet. But you did. You know what? I'd feel like I was a whore, doing it to thank you for the job, and I don't want that. I understand. Give me your hand. Can you feel my heart? It's still beating. I'm ready. Excuse me? Am I too late? - Too late? - For the baby? No, it's not too late. If you still want to I'll do it. Now.

Would you like a ride? No thanks, I'll take a taxi. Thank you for everything. Not at all, thank you. My husband and I have a question we don't dare ask. What is it? We were wondering... if your illness is hereditary, for the baby? Don't worry, it's cancer. Terminal cancer. Oh, I see. Call us if you want to get together, or if you need anything. OK. I'd like to ask you something too. Does he kick? It's only been to months! As soon as he does, let me know so I can come feel your belly. Goodbye. - Will you be alright? - Yeah. I hope so. Good luck.
