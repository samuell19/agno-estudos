AD 2042, THE GREAT 4 INITIATED "WAR AS AN INDUSTRY." THE WORLD DUBBED IT "SUSTAINABLE WAR." AD 2044 THE GLOBAL SIMULTANEOUS DEFAULT THIS TRIGGERED A RAPID ESCALATION AND CAUSED TURMOIL. EVEN ADVANCED NATIONS SUFFERED FROM CIVIL WARS. AD 2045 Ah, it's wonderful not to have any noise. Too bad it can't stay this way forever. [inhales, exhales] [vehicle approaching] [upbeat music] ONE TACTICAL FORCE KNOWN AS "GHOST" THRIVED IN THIS WAR-TORN WORLD. [Standard] Hmm. Ishikawa. Is your squad leader that little honey in the turtle neck over there? The names Standard, but they call me Stan. Nice to meet you, boss lady! [Batou] So, Major, what's the plan? We're gonna have our mission briefing around the barbeque. [Major] Looks like we're gonna have to take a rain check on that cookout in Palm Springs. [gun fires] All personnel stand by for brain dive. Caught red-handed. You had a beer without us, Major. [grunts] Won't we get hacked if we're wireless? Just talk normally they're so far away. We might get hacked if you were in charge. Luckily, I know what I'm doing. Our mission today, your run-of-the-mill clean up operation at the Sustainer hideout. They're apparently planning a large-scale raid on Gated Town. So, you're saying the kid gloves are off for this one then. Not quite, our orders are to capture as many of them alive as possible. -Seriously? -Yeah, buzz kill. Hey, you can take it up with management. My assumption is the police when we bring them in for questioning [grumbles] [rebel] Take that! [Major] How much you wanna bet these guys are here to get in on the raid? Sustainable war victims who decided to turn around and victimize everyone else. That's what I'm talking about! [laughs] The way I see it, the more party people out here sustain-eering, the merrier. [chortling] [upbeat music ends] [indistinct chatter] [sighs] What an eyesore. CHINESE FAST FOOD [Togusa] This is Togusa. I'm at the specified location. [operator] Nice timing. Okay, the target's currently in the middle of a virtual currency server attack. Are you sure you're okay by yourself? Wouldn't it be safer to send in police reinforcement to nab them? [Togusa] Relax, this isn't my first rodeo. [operator] Oh, right. I forget you used to be a detective back in the day. Even Japan's dangerous now. Luckily, I got you to watch my back, girl. We all got a pack heat now, even us rent-a-cops. Right, Major? [Underwear Man] You're going to arrest me! -Don't move! -[Underwear Man shrieks] [scoffs] Aw! Seriously! [in hoarse voice] Stay away from me! [action music] [screams] [shrieks] [groans] [yelling, bone cracks] [loud zapping, groans] [grunting] [groans, sighs] [policeman] All right. Let's go back up everybody. [cell phone rings] [Togusa] The Chief? Hello? [Daisuke] Yeah, it's been a while, Togusa. How are you? Good. Sorry I fell out of touch. How've you been, Chief? Doing well? [Daisuke] Yes, fortunately, I've been able to keep working at the Interior Ministry even after Section 9 was disbanded. I heard, year before last, you became Public Security Bureau adviser. [Daisuke] Mm-hm. Togusa, I have a special favor to ask of you. [explosion] [Daisuke] Yeah, tell me something eh, do you still hold a grudge against the Major and the others for leaving you behind? [Togusa] It's water under the bridge. But honestly, not a day went by when I didn't at least wonder what my life could have been. You know. I see. [tense music] A few days ago, I got a request from the prime minister regarding a somewhat complicated matter. Do you think you'd be able to come to my office tomorrow? I mean, this is all a bit sudden, sir. Uh… But that's no problem. I'll swing by tomorrow afternoon. [Daisuke] Excellent. I'll see you then. Got it, sir. I don't think… I've taken a personal day all year. So, why not? [car whirs, clanks] Don't delude yourselves. So-called sustainable war is just a big game of political chicken. Except pretty much everyone loses. Namely, the politicians are not savvy enough to negotiate. And amateurs like you, completely out of your element. Go home and don't let us catch you here again! And if you don't have a home to go back to, be thankful you still have your lives. [grunts] I have a sneaking suspicion this might end up being my last job. [upbeat music] [helicopter approaches] [knocks] Enter. [Togusa] Yes, sir. Coming in. My… you've gotten more intense. [Togusa] Is that something I should be happy to hear? It would depend on your frame of mind how you choose to take it. In that case, I'll take it as a compliment. Huh, he's gonna bring back Section 9? [Daisuke grumbles] What do you think is his goal? Hard to be sure. But I imagine, people who have just taken office want to arm themselves to better flex their muscles. Should the need arise. [Togusa] So, uh… I'm assuming he learned of Section 9 existence from documents still within the Interior Ministry? [Daisuke] My take away from using his proposal is that if we would to rebuild Section 9, he's not the only one who benefits. He must be responding to pressure from the American government that special resources be allotted. So, then… it's was the Liberals feared all along. That an American-born prime minister would be their puppet. Is that right? [Daisuke] I've yet to meet him. So, I can't speak on where his allegiances lie. In regards to Section 9, since it's being revived. I'd like to send them on a bit of an undertaking. What sort of undertaking? Over these past few years, I've asked myself how best to manage the uncertainty that now plagues our society. You and the rest of the team will lay the framework. That will allow the next generation. To find the answer to that question. [ominous music] If I'm honest chief, I don't have a lot to contribute. But whatever skills and resources I have are at your disposal. I'm glad to hear it. [Daisuke] In that case. Go get to the Major and the rest of the six original members of Section 9. [Togusa] Yes, sir. Togusa? I thought you were taking some time off. Just here to tie up some loose ends. [sighs] Okay. [computer fastly whirs] [database AI] What would you like to search for today? [Togusa] A mercenary group called GHOST. Operating out of South America. [database AI] Very well, now entering, dark web. [fast beeps] REVENGE/GHOST [Drug Man] That explosion pissed off the Raiders in Mexico. They've had to move their operation in North America. [Nameless] We may never get a better chance than this. [Infinity Man] I'm not so sure. -[Drug Man chuckles] -[Nameless] What's so funny? I thought you all wanted to get revenge. [One Man] Of course, we do. [indistinct chatter] GHOST is still as settled as ever, I see. -[Drug Man] …with a PMC. -[Nameless] What? [sighs] [Nameless] I take that means you're gonna pass on this. [One Man] Yep, that's pretty much the gist. [sighs] [Nameless] Fine then. I'm out of here. [Togusa] Hey, got a minute. [Nameless] Hmm? [grunts] [grunts] [Infinity Man] Oh, you're back. You forget your wallet? No. Just a question. Why would a private contract make you back off? What are you scared of? The contractor they're working for is Obsidian, genius. Obsidian? Hmm. Remind me again what outfit you said you were with? Everybody knows Obsidian! They've got a reputation for tight security. If you so much just lay a hand on one of theirs. They're gonna make you pay for it. Oh, that Obsidian. [Tachikoma] I think it's for you to go, Togusa. [grumbles, loud spark] Aah! [grunting] -[circuits zapping] -Huh? -Whoa! What the hell? -[smoke alarm beeps] [fire alarm blares] Tch… what? What happened? [grunts] -Huh? Togusa? -[fire alarm continues to blare] That's the place? [Ishikawa] Yeah. Okay, I'm in. There's one armored car mounting a 105mm tank gun. And I clock, 17 members. On the upside, our inside mention tells it's accurate so far. What do we do? [Major] I'm curious where guys like that got their hands on those weapons. Obsidian, this is GHOST. [male voice] This is Obsidian. [Major] We're commencing the operation shortly. [male voice] Copy that. -Tachikoma! -[Tachikoma] Roger! [OT] Come on. It wasn't my fault, bro. -[OT] No, no, no. No way. -[RB] Totally on you, just own it. What… the hell? [grunts, thuds] Thanks for the intel. [Standard grunts] No way these guys are students. They're too damn old to be in school. [spy] They're washed up former college football players whose student loans bankrupted them. [Major] Their debt was wiped clean by the Global Default, yet here they are. Guess they found a new outlet for that excess testosterone. They still have some kind of axe to grind. Angry at those living past the gate for all the lives that weren't reset. Well, frankly, I can't say I don't know how they feel. So, how do these clowns get all these toys? [sighs] That's what's strange. [spy] They apparently have an altruistic patron with deep pockets. Called the Good One-Percenter. He gives them whatever weapons they need. -Huh? -Huh? The guy just mails them or what? This Good One-Percenter gave them an armored vehicle? What psycho does that? I never found out how they communicated, let alone his real identity. Kinda wish I've taken a peek on their leader's cyberbrain. [panting] I think it's uh… time for me to go. [Major] A think-tank is standing by for you up top. -Thanks, appreciate it. -[Standard] Yo. [Major] Wait. [dog's howling sound] [Batou] Hey, that's one of those damn guard dog robots! [grunts] Why didn't you tell us about it? -I… -[Standard] You have one job, dude! [Major] And it's looking right through our optical camouflage. [high-pitched charging] [Batou] I hate to say it but it looks like our stealth entry was a bust. [Major] Wait. [disgruntled roar] [both grunt] [pants, grunts] [gasping] [man] What's that? Batou, get moving! Omoshiro, we're on the guys downstairs. -Got it. And stop calling me that, man! -[gun fires] [growls] [grunts] Look alive, someone's inside. [loud thudding, grunts] [footsteps approaching] [thuds, groans] Aw, shit! [Standard] Man, amateurs are scary! They have the skill of pros but double the crazy. [thuds, groans] [clanks, grunts] [Batou] Quit screwing around and take them out. [Standard] Easier said than done, man. [grunts] [growls] [grunts] [growling, grunts] [groans] This isn't a commercial model. Is it military grade? Probably. Major, I'm clocking three in there. -[Major] Tachikoma! -Roger! [loud creaking] Attention! We have your vehicle surrounded. Surrender peacefully or else! You hear that, we're totally surrounded. Nothing but a little interception. What's up? Ain't got their learner's permits. [leader] We're almost synced. Run down the clock! [machine whirs] [screams] It's here! Huh? [Saito] Major, we've got a problem. [Major] They've got a stealth drone too? Major, it's got a lock on us! [Tachikoma blabbering] [Saito] I don't know how but they've tapped into my satellite feed. Huh? [Standard] Guys, I can't get through to Saito anymore. [Ishikawa] That isn't good. -Tachikoma! -Roger! [drone engine whirs] [action music] Come on! It's even got Hellfires? Their sugar-daddy gave them some working firepower. [Batou] What the hell is that One-Percenter thinking? [Standard] Hey, at least this means the armored car is pinned down from that right? [Ishikawa] It sure doesn't look like it. [computer beeps] [engine revs] [Major] Batou, go get the Stinger! I'm on it! [machine whirring] [engine gathers power] [Tachikoma] Geez, that thing's AI is like scary good! [computer beeps] Whoops! How do you like that? [Tachikoma] Have some more! Come and get me. [OT] Damn it, it's moving so fast! [gasps] -[alarm buzzing] -[all grunting] [tires screech] [grunts] [Tachikoma] Major, I'm out of bullets! [action music] Major, the drone's turned around. [computer beeps, whirs] [Major] Good, looks like optical camouflage works on this one. Mr. Saito! Are you okay? Huh? I hear you, but where are you? [machine whirs] There are four more missiles on that thing. [Batou] Major. We caught up to you. [Major] Good. Hit it! Aw, crap! The drone's being targeted. -Okay, then! -[all grunt] Hmm? Shit. [hisses] [panting] Huh? [Major] Batou, the drone can't see through optical camo. [Batou] Roget that! [Standard] Think those idiots inside are dead? [Batou] If they aren't, I'll strangle them myself to make sure this time. [Ishikawa] Major, that thing's not stopping even with these guys taken out. [Major] If its rocket manages to fire around beyond the gate, it's all over. [Standard] We're all out of options, huh? [communication device beeps] [Saito] Hey, Major, you miss me? [Major] Saito! Good thing these badasses double as our body armor, huh? Saito, still have use of your Stingers? [Saito] Yeah, I think so. -Let's go! -[machine whirs] What do you say we nab the jokers in here and make our own fun? -Sure. -Now you're talking! [Major] Can you catch up to it? [Saito] Yeah, I'm within firing range. [Major] Good, do it! [Major] And it's even got flares. Saito, force it lower. [Saito] Understood, I'll see what I can do. [upbeat music] [computer whizzing] This damn AI's on my last nerve! [grunts] [upbeat music continues] [whirs, beeps] [grunts] [grunts] Tachikoma. Stand guard over this thing. Roger. They probably pay you next to nothing. Am I right? Why risk your lives for them? Because it ain't always about the money. If I'm being honest, we do it 'cause we're good at it. And it also happens to be what we love to do. See! Then you're all no different from us! What? [sighs] Maybe we're not. [vehicle approaches] You, quarterback. Are you their leader? Yeah, but for the record, I'm a running back. Tell me how you got your hand on that drones and those Hellfires. [clears throat, scoffs] Don't want to talk? [Tachikoma] Major, we've got a problem! We really screwed up big time. What! [chuckles] -Guys, we just won! -[everyone laughing] What the hell? [tense music] [footsteps approaching] [tense music continues] Well, you made quite the mess of things. Put down your weapons and come along quietly. Sorry, but there seems to be some kind of mistake. These goons fired that missile, not us. You'll have the opportunity to explain yourselves later. Oh, boy. A Delta Force cyborg squad? Looks like it, based on the gear their using and the coating on their barriers. And if we say no? It doesn't matter if you're willing or not. [Major] Looks like we have no choice but to play along for now. [Batou] Damn it, I don't like this. [Major] Their timing was a little too perfect. It's possible they were planning on detaining us from the start. [Batou] You mean this op was a trap? [Major] And this might be the guy who set it. [Batou] But why? [Major] The only way to find out is to ask him. You got us. We're not gonna argue. A wise decision. [Major] Tachikoma, use your thermoptic camouflage to lie low on the buffer zone. If they spot you, you'll be dismantled. -Yikes, copy that. -[grunts] [Togusa] The Major and the others have spent the past few years moving from battle to battle. Under the team named GHOST, in South America. Right now, they're working for an American private military company called Obsidian. But that's all I've been able to dig up. Of course. [Togusa] Obsidian's headquarters are in Los Angeles. I tried to contact them but they haven't responded. So, I was thinking I'd fly out there to see what I can find. [Daisuke] Good idea. [Togusa] Hey, Chief. Hmm? Ah, since this is a work trip. Can I get reimbursed? Hold on to your receipts and we'll see how well you do. Thanks, I appreciate that. -[chopper engine whirs] -[electronic door opens] Apologies. That first impression wasn't the greatest. Why don't we start over? Uh-huh! Appreciate the apology. But what I'd really like to hear is an explanation for all this. That was our only option out in the open. We were being watched closely. Okay. Let's kick things off with a proper introduction. You can call me John Smith. You're here, because I would like to enlist services for a job. -Huh? -Hmm. I'm sorry, what? What the hell for? You have a subcontractor, why bother us? From what I observed your team accomplished during that last operation. It seems to me you're the most qualified for what we need done. Your negotiation skills need some work. Well I think it's no secret that I work for the American government. So, you see. This isn't a negotiation. You have no choice. Your expertise is required to carry out a rescue mission of a certain individual. -[electronic door opens] -[Batou grumbles] [Togusa] It's Togusa. I tried sending another email to Obsidian but they're still not answering me. [Daisuke] I did a little digging of my own. The company appears to be rather highly regarded in mercenary circles. [Togusa] Yeah, I know. I made it to LA. I'm gonna pay them a visit. [Daisuke] Keep me posted. [engine revving] [alarm blares in distance] [Togusa] I wanted to talk to your boss about a team called GHOST. [door opens] [door creaks] [footsteps retreating] [door closes] -[gun cocks] -[grunts] You don't try to bullshit me, you might just walk out of here alive. Now, tell me who you're working for? Hang on, this is just a misunderstanding. I'm a former member of GHOST. I just came from Japan. [gun clicks] [tense music] -Ooh! I found him. -Huh? Hey! Are you okay? [in cracked voice] Maybe, no, I don't think so. [Togusa] You want proof? [Togusa sighs] Their female team leader is called the Major and she's full-prosthetic. Oh, and… when her teammates know she's not listening to what they're saying. They call her, Queen Kong. Is that enough for you? [snorts] -[sighs] -Hell boy. I'm surprised you're still breathing if you call her that. [chuckles] I'm not dumb enough to say it to her face. [sighs] [exhales] [Togusa] You seem like you're on edge. Want to tell me what's going on? Hate to tell you… But they've disappeared. They're gone? [engine revs] [Daisuke] No one knows where they are? [Togusa] No, they said they all vanished during their last op. The president of Obsidian sent some people to investigate the scene but… -[computer beeps] -They came up empty. [Daisuke] Sounds like someone cleaned up after the dust settled. [Togusa] If that's the case, this doesn't look good. If it's an abduction, I'll see if I can figure out who took them. [Daisuke] Don't dig too deep. It's safe to assume that this is the work of a powerful organization. [Togusa] I'll do my best, sir. [loud rumbling] [loud creaks] [Togusa] There it is. [ominous music] [grunts, panting] [exhales] A missile attack? Seems like overkill. No way this fits the MO of those guys in the chatroom. -[Tachikoma] Hey! Togusa. -Hmm? [sighs] Okay, I must really be losing it. I'm starting to hear their voices now. -Togusa! It is you. -[gasps] [exclaims, chortling] I knew I'd recognize you. Tachikoma? What are you doing here? I was just going to ask you the same question. Hmm? Huh? [babbling] Look at that. Snipers in plain sight. [grunts] Again? Just go to show, they really want to keep this op under wraps. [Standard] Damn it. Um, these things always shock me. [Standard grumbles, screams] -[Standard grunts] -[Batou] The gear's so cheap. [plane engine revving] [helicopter blades whir] [Daisuke] Can I trouble you for a few minutes of your time, Ms. Byron? [scoffs] Hello Daisuke, it's been a while. I'm sorry but I don't have a lot of time. So, I'll get straight to the point. Your agency oversees several operations. Do you know if any of them involved a mercenary team that goes by the name of GHOST? There's one. I can't tell you any specifics but GHOST is working on a mission for us. I need that group's personnel as soon as I can possibly get them. Could you take them off that assignment and relinquish them to my jurisdiction? That isn't going to be possible. Not even on orders from you. Then perhaps when they finish the operation? [Byron] I doubt it. When the mission's over, I believe the entire thing is going to be scrubbed out of existence, the team included. It's too important. The country I've dedicated my life to need this operation to be a success. I don't know if there's anyone who can save them now. But if there were someone, it would have to be the president himself. [tense music] [John] Your drop point is right over here. This is where you're going to find the target for this rescue mission. Get in and get out as quickly as you can. Understood. [snaps] [grunts, groans] It feels good to be free! Oh, there is one last thing I forgot to mention. In the unlikely event you decide to abandon the mission, the penalties you'll face will be quite severe. [tense music continues] We might completely disappear on you. And you can't punish us if you can't find us. [laughs] Oh, you're more than welcome to try. Don't expect it to work. [grumbles] [grunts] Oh. It's in your hands now. Major Motoko Kusanagi. [Major] Ishikawa, check our position. Batou, how many of them are there? [Batou] At least a full platoon, maybe more. [Ishikawa] Major, I've got an update on our location. It looks like they propped us off not far from where we were when they first picked us up. [Major] What do you mean? [Ishikawa] We're in the middle of that gated town in LA. [Standard] What! Oh, wait a minute. That means the guy we're trying to rescue must be on the house arrest on the goddamn Beverly Hills mansion! [helicopter approaches] [Ishikawa] I've identified the owner of the place they got hit with that missile. Patrick Huge. Famous for his work in the robotics industry. A lot of people point to him as the poster boy for sustainable war. [Standard] You mean the CEO of Huge Robotics? [Ishikawa] That's the guy. [Major] I don't like the sound of that. [Standard] Hang on. Doesn't that mean he might be the Good One-Percenter who gave all those weapons to the Raiders? [Ishikawa] Yeah, that's what I was getting at. What's the mean for us? This isn't really a rescue mission. It's a snatch-and-grab! Looks that way. What the hell? That means this guy is the one calling the shots for the Raiders. Why don't they just arrest him? We're here for a reason. And it's not just to capture an ostensibly law-abiding billionaire. We just don't know what it is yet. [grunts] Saito, what's the rear look like? Deltas are fanned out. Seems like they're keeping an eye on us. Why aren't they helping us with this? Isn't it obvious? We all just got volunteered to do their dirty work. Whoa, whoa, whoa, that's bad news. -We gotta get out of here. -Saito, maintain overwatch from here. Let's go. -Batou. -[Batou] Yeah. [Major] Send out position to the Tachikoma's -without letting the Deltas catch on. -[Batou] Will do. [upbeat music] [machine whirs] [beeps] [Ishikawa grunts] He's got some nasty toys. [Standard sighs] More of those guard dog robots. [Batou] Whoa, you're seeing what I'm seeing? I see she's been dead for at least two months. And get this, the deceased is Patrick Huge's wife. [Ishikawa] This is making less sense by the minute. How the hell can the CEO be lounging around the house while his wife's dead as a doornail by the pool? [Standard] How can we be sure the guy is even still inside? [Major] He's in there. The NSA wouldn't send us to abduct Patrick Huge if they weren't a hundred percent sure of his current whereabouts. Man, this is seriously messed up. I may be a mercenary, but I'm first and foremost a law-abiding American-- [Batou] So, what's the plan? Do we bolt? No. We'll take him into custody one way or another. If only to break through the Delta's net. I figured you were gonna say that. [buzzing] Hold this position till dawn. Then we'll make our stealth entry. Whatever you do, don't kill him in the crossfire. [whistling] [explosion] What the? [grunts] [twangs] [grunts, groans] [pants, grunts] [grunting] [panting] Phew! [whirs, grunts] [Major] Batou and I will take downstairs. Ishikawa and Omoshiro, take the second floor. [Ishikawa] Major, I found something strange. [Major] He's selling off all his company's assets? [Ishikawa] Yeah, the reason he's still held up in here is 'cause he hasn't been able to finalize a deal. [computer beeps] [Batou] Blood Robotics' total asset has to be worth 20 billion easy. Hard to move that much cash and fly under the radar. [Ishikawa] No doubt. It looks like his plan was to use a program he wrote to transfer the assets all at once. After his apparent death in the missile attack. [Major] Anything? [Ishikawa] No sign of him. [inhales, exhales] [thuds, gun cocks] [inhales, exhales] [inhales, exhales] [Standard grunting] -[grunting continues] -[Ishikawa] Omoshiro, what's the problem? [Standard grunts] Can't… fight it. [groans] [zaps, grunting] [Ishikawa] Idiot, you let your guard down! [Batou] Geez, he got hacked already? [Major] Everyone, switch to autistic mode. -[Ishikawa] Understood. -[Batou] Got it! Patrick Huge, I presumed. Stay right where you are. [gun clicks] [groans] [grunts] Hey, what is with these things? Enough playing around. -Aim for its legs. -Got it. My fire control system is down. -[grunts] -[inhales, exhales] He's dodging, before we even pull the trigger. What the hell is he, a cyborg? No! He should only have a cyberbrain. I'm telling you moves like those aren't possible with just a cyberbrain. [grunts] [grunts, groans] [groans] What's going on? [dog's howling sound] Shit. Major, the guard dogs have been activated. [grunts, bones crunching] [bones breaking] [grunts] [percussive music] [thuds, grunts] [percussive music continues] Major! [grunts] [Ishikawa] Here they come. [ominous music] [grunts] Hey! Hold it! [ominous music continues] What is this guy, some kind of freak? Help! Get this cyberlock off me, man! [Batou] A closet? Hopefully this guy is putting us some damn pants. Batou, get clear! It's a damn arm suit just hanging around on their closet. Rich guys got an outfit for every occasion. That son of a bitch Smith knew all along what he was getting us into. [Saito] What the hell? [all grunt] Great, Huge made those too? Good! Nice, Saito! [Ishikawa] What the hell? [Saito] Reactive armor, huh? What? Batou. I can only give you one more support shot. Batou, let's shift to a cyber attack. Is that a good idea? That training program was accurate, this guy's cyber skills ain't nothing to sneeze at. Damn it. Yeah, well, so are mine! [grunts] CQB skills package download makes sense now. [groans, grunts] [growling] Sorry guys, but I'm not getting taken out by a bunch of dogs. [growling] -Tachikoma? -Hi! [Batou] Major! [Tachikoma grunts] Tachikoma! Major, are you okay? Togusa! You saved my butt again. No problem at all. It's what we're here for. -Batou. -Hmm? Do you have your malware collection on you? Yeah, why? Disengage from autistic mode. Then hit him with everything you've got. Huh? Yeah, okay I can do that. But I don't remember what's in the damn thing. Doesn't matter, as long as they slowdown that thing's processing speed. Autistic mode off. Hit it! [Batou] Chew on this! [groans, grunts] [grunts] What kind of monster is this guy? Tachikoma! Gotcha! [Major] Ishikawa, pop the hatch. On it. [grunts] -Son of a bitch! -[loud thud] [machine whirs] [hissing] [grunts, groans] Cyberlock's not working. It would be a lot easier if you cooperate! [Batou] Seriously, nothing's easy with this guy. [Ishikawa] That's for sure. Major, what's the deal? [whirs, zaps] [grunts, gasps] [Saito] Major? Answer me! Major! Saito! Fire! What are we gonna do with this pantless bastard? Huh? [gunshot echos] [gasps] Major? What happened? -Huh? Major. -[grunts] -[panting] -[machine door opens] Saito! Major? That guy's… not human. [Tachikoma whimpers] Huh? Of all our projected scenarios, this particular outcome was the worst. Sorry, but it was out of our control. No way that thing was gonna surrender willingly. In your brain dive, how deep did you end up going? You wanna know? Hey, what's he talking about? I don't know what you think you saw in there. But you know as well as I, your fates were sealed from the start. [chimes] Director Ada? [Byron] Abort the operation. Maintain the situation as is and wait for my orders. Director, you don't have the authority to call off this operation. [Byron] Maybe not. But he might. Huh? -[supersonic pass by] -[grunts] [platoon leader] Sir, its call sign shows as Marine One. [tense music] [John gasping] [tense music continues] -[Major] The Chief? -[Batou] I'll be damned. Maybe you care to read this. Hold… hold on. An executive order? These individuals, are members of a special forces unit under direct orders from your president. Special forces? What's this about? Since you have onsite operation authority, I would hope, you are not unaware of that. [grunts] Don't collect the bodies. Analyzing Mrs. Huge's lifelogs will be top priority. Roger. It's been a long time, hasn't it, Major? This is the last place I expected to run into you again. We do seem to owe you our lives though. Not to worry. I have a job you uniquely equipped to help with. Take care. And safe travels back to your homeland. Princess Mei Ling. Qì! Zài jiàn! Baby! [Batou] What the hell kind of memories did you put in his head? An exhilarating tale of swashbuckling adventure. You got a problem with that? Nah! No problem here. He just turned out to not entirely suck, that's all. Yes, I agree. All right, would you mind filling us in on the real objective of this operation? The owner of this mansion… what the hell was that thing? Patrick Huge. In order words, the mastermind in wealthy benefactor. Who donated all the weapons to the Raiders. Who carried out his agenda. That anguish she was asking you. My team and I deserve to know the whole truth. The real reason you wanted to apprehend a prominent public figure. And why you almost sacrificed us to hide your government's involvement? After all that went down, you owe us that much. If we were to act in any official capacity, and news that they exist was somehow made public. The world would be plunged into a chaos from which it would not recover. "They"? Wait. Are you saying that there are more than one of those things out there? If you had actually managed to bring Huge alive, we could have studied him to create a countermeasure against the rest. [Batou exhales] Hold on now. So, everything's gone to shit and it's all our fault? [grunts, gasps] If you'd given us as intel in the first place, we could have come up with a Plan B! I think he understands our position. -For your own good, it's best to tell us. -[heavy breathing, grunts] Their particular cyberbrains have processing power that far exceeds that of any supercomputer. We've learned, the Global Simultaneous Default was an event they carried out themselves. [grumbles, grunts] I thought that occurred from a failure of G4 policy? It's easy to just point fingers at the state. But the reality of blame is far more complex and nuanced. I knew when I linked to its cyberbrain. It was no way it could have been human. So, what the hell was it? My department and I, have decided to refer to them as "posthuman" for convenience. I just have to let you see for yourselves. All of you, cyberbrains offline. [door whizzing] [Batou] Let me guess, you got another freak with a super high-performance CPU stashed back here. [loud banging, door opens] [John] The first of them we discovered, was this man. [scoffs] [Batou] Is he conscious? [John] Yes and no. He's conscious but there's severe damage to nearly half of his cerebrum. Unfortunately, that makes him a less than ideal posthuman research specimen. [grunts] -[machine beeps, whirs] -[staff] Capture his message now. Beginning analysis. What was that? Our theory is that he's trying to use code to communicate with us. But the data is too corrupted. That said, he seems to have something on his mind in regards to your visit here today. Oh, maybe he's just happy to see us. [John] Who's to say. We can't get to cipher his messages so there's no way to know. Is that a nurse over there? She doesn't seem to have a cyberbrain. [John] Unnecessary precaution. Without a cyberbrain, she can't be hacked or hijacked. If he accesses to the net even for a moment, he could instantly gain control over our system. And the entire thing would be at his mercy. To that end, we've taken a precaution that every system in this facility be air-gapped. These capabilities of theirs, is it something they were born with? No, every one of them started out as ordinary human beings. [John] Gary Harts, was a master sergeant in the US Centcom Third Army. I'm told that in his younger days, he faithfully carried out orders, was reliable, dependable… -[Gary] Are you okay? -…and well respected by his peers. [Gary grunts] -[explosion] -[grunts, groans] [soldier] Commander! [grunts] -[soldier] Comman… Commander! -[Gary coughs] -[soldier] Commander, you okay? -[coughing continues] [grunts] Never felt better. [John] After retiring from the service, he moved to the suburbs, to live a quiet life with his wife and children. But one day, he came down with a severe and mysterious fever. Over the course of a week, we're told Gary moved into a catatonic state. Unable to speak or interact with the world around him. After spending another week in that state, he suddenly recovered. His family was overjoyed there was no damage to his memories or ability to speak. But his wife noticed something was different about him. And grew increasingly concerned. [Gary's wife] Ah… honey? And then, her fears were realized. [panting] [grunts] [gasping] [groans, thuds] [tragic music] [gasps] He… shot his own wife? After the incident, Gary just dropped off the map. [Tachikoma] Can you zoom in a little closer on the D1 isolation room feed? Sure. [gasps] What… how did you? -Yup! -[gasping] -Wait, aren't you guys think-tanks? -[shivers] Ah, don't worry about us. Act like we're not ever here. Yeah, we're not here. [John] A week after Gary disappeared, the security system of an air force base in Nevada housing a nuclear facility went down. Shortly after, someone breached the installation. According to a survivor, his body appeared to move autonomously as if refusing to obey the signals given by his brain. [tragic music continues] [Major] You're saying he instantly hacked to the cyberbrain of every guard? Ones with the latest defensive barriers? -[loud explosion] -[groans] The way he reacts… [Batou] It's just like the other guy. -[alarm blaring] -[soldier's heavy breathing, panting] -[grunts] -[guns firing] [groans] [grunts] [John] That happened roughly two months ago. It was the first recorded incident involving a posthuman. [Ishikawa] So, they tried to launch a nuke to what? Lay the foundation for another nuclear war. [John] Their motives remain unclear. But the point of impact he entered for the missile before getting shot was Moscow. Then war. Is that the objective shared by every posthuman? We can't say for sure. Based on the situation we've observed thus far, their objective seems to be the collapse of the existing social order. [John] The recent acts of terrorism known as "raids" are just one example of the domino effect their actions have set in motion. Let me guess, you're gonna blame them for sustainable war too? [John] We launch the war-as-an-industry model with the sole intent of bringing stability and security to the world economy. But I assure you that was never intended to be more than a controlled economic act. Well sure, from the perspective of those who don't live with the bombs land, I think every war, could be viewed as simply a controlled economic act. You make a fair point. Violence has been spurred on by the posthumans. And civilians have been increasingly caught in the crossfire. Hmm? What's on your mind, Major? The subject. He's been throwing that paper airplane for a while now. Could it be childhood regression from the brain damage? Look closer. He throws it again and again. Yet it always somehow returns to his hand. [computers beeping] [Major] He has to be calculating the temperature, pressure, drag… Every variable inside that chamber. -Huh! -What the hell? [Batou] Except that time. My goodness, I'm proud of you. You threw it even further than usual today. -[alarming music] -[grunts] Impossible. Was he pretending to be brain dead this whole time? Worry about that later! No, stop! Call the security. Copy that, sir. [alarm wails] [grunts, thuds] [percussive music] [Togusa] More messages. What is going on? [Major] He's taken over your system. [John] No, it would be impossible for him to connect to it. And that glitch code he's been sending out intermittently? We've been archiving all of them on this server for analysis. -[thuds] -That must be it. The code fragments you stored because you thought they were messages needing deciphering, were probably some kind of virus. One he created for the purpose of infecting that button. [Major] That's the only function that's tied into the entire facility. So, you're saying… [door opens] [guard] Huh? [percussive music intensifies] [groans, thuds] [grunts] -Batou! -[Batou] Yeah! -He's trying to break out, don't let him! -[grunts] -This is bad! -[Tachikoma gasps] Let's shut down the system, right now! Right! So, what the heck is going on? It's hard to tell from just the video feed. -Hmm. -It looks so juicy, though. I'm just gonna jack in for a sec. [percussive music halts] [machine whirs] [voice harmonizing] New-terminal-detected-in-system. -This-one-should-prove-quite-useful. -Whoa! What'd you say? Did you hear that? Let me have a go! I wanna try. Something's wrong, my barriers are fading, and everything is blurring together! -[grunts, dings] -[both shrieking] [gasping] -What was I just saying? -Hmm? Hmm. [loud banging] [Major grunts] [grunts, thuds] [grunting] Major, they're coming in from above, too! [screams] It's only a matter of time before they smash their way in. [loud banging] [grunts] Aargh! You pick the wrong cyborg to screw around with. We'll never get anywhere at this rate! Damn it. How is this happening? We've already shut down the system! It won't help. He bypassed and he's controlling your robots remotely. [grunts] The only way to stop them is… No way! Without him, we're back to square one! [action music] You're the one running this operation! Either make the decision yourself. [in strained voice] Or let the situation decide for you and get out of our way! [action music continues] [in stressed-out voice] All right then. -Batou! -I'm on it! [flatlines] [grunts, clanking] [in hoarse voice] You got a problem with this? [in normal voice] There was no other way. That was awfully close. Thanks for saving me. Don't hold down on us, what'd you see? Hmm? It's actually kinda hard to put into words. Ooh! Many jobs we've done are complicated. But this is a real tricky one, Chief. Yes, looks that way. [scoffs] [fighting from video game] [Yuzu] Brother… You're staring at Kanami again. [in whispered voice] Darn it, Yuzu. I told you a thousand times you can't be here. What's the big deal? It's not like anyone pays attention to you anyway. [gasping] Go on, get out of here. [in normal voice] Shimamura. Where are you going? Class is starting. [door closes] [snickering, laughing] Sorry. [Purin] Has it been a while since you came back to Fukuoka? Hmm? Ah… Yeah, it has. First time back to Japan in a while too. It hasn't changed much, has it? Actually, there have been a whole lot of changes. For one thing, there're a lot people coming back from other countries saying they were homesick. Ah, plus thanks to the push to attract wealthy immigrants. The economy is starting to do really well too. [chuckles] Cause of the work of the robots and the poor. [gasping] [sighs] Yes, well… I guess, but the robots aren't complaining about it much now, are they? [sighs] Who's to say. -Whoa! -Look at this place! -Ba! -Hey, Ba! [all] It's Mr. Batou! You guys never change, do you? Hi, Major! Long time no see! You guys are so lucky you got to run off with Mr. Batou and the others and have adventures none of us can even imagine! We sure did! Your customizations are so cool. Where did you have them done? -I say we all synchronize… -Huh? …so, we can share their experiences! Okay, sure! [all] Yay! Ha-ha! Oh, no, you don't! How many times do I have to tell you? You are not allowed to synchronize without permission. I know you know the rules. Purin has to check everything first, remember! Hmph! Shoo, shoo, shoo! Ah, why are you shooing us away like were animals! -We're not infected! -Hmm? You're so hung up on the rules that you overthink everything. You've got to learn to be open to new ideas! Enforcing the rules is my job. Wait, I know you. [squeals] Hi, my name is Purin Esaki. Purin? Eh, you know it… here's my profile if you wanna look. Wow, that is pretty impressive. -Studied abroad in America for a semester… -Hey! -…right after finishing junior high. -Hey, come on! And skipped straight on -to MIT to get your doctorate, huh? -Naughty machines turn against their master don't get to play this amazing game! Wait, that's a super rare puzzle game we haven't been able to figure out how to find it! You want it? -You sure? Okay, come and get it! -[clamoring] She's got them eating right out of her hand. [chuckles] [Chris] What a treat. The famous Major Kusanagi. America has asked to uncover and drive out the posthumans. -Uh-huh! -Thank you for accepting. I'm counting on you. Correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't think we've officially accepted this job yet. -Ah… -Prime Minister. All of this is highly confidential. Why don't we move this discussion to the internal network? Good idea. [zooms] As I mentioned in my report, this mission is going to be incredibly difficult. In addition to the unique nature of this team, I believe it would be impossible to obey American orders while also being attached to a government organization. But if you are still dead set on putting us on this job, we're gonna need a big budget. If you're sure you can give us everything we need. Then we can work something out. [sighs] Almost ten times higher than I thought. I'm gonna need some time. This isn't a decision I can make on my own. But even if it is a yes, you know the Americans will want to call the shots on this. They ask too much and we'll just walk out of here the same way we walked in. [sighs] [John] You don't honestly think such selfish demands will be accepted, do you? [scoffs] Can't believe I'm looking at your ugly mug again. Exiled to Japan, huh? That screwup was pretty awful. I've only been dispatched here to serve as an adviser for this project. My status as head of the Posthuman Response Agency remains unchanged. Hello, I'm John Smith from the NSA. [ominous music] -[grumbles, grunts] -[sighs] [Chris] And this is? A list of suspected posthumans. Specifically the ones we believed are hiding in this country. Memorize these names. Don't even copy it to your cyberbrain. We identified a pattern following the events of what happened to Gary Harts. Posthumans all exhibit three specific symptoms. Fever, unusual appetite, and a change in their personality. After running an analysis combining these factors with medical data. We found a little over 100,000 potential posthumans spread throughout the Pacific Rim. We narrow that list down to 827 whose personality changes were most dramatic. Of those, 813 are already deceased. That leaves us with just 14 suspects we believe have awakened as posthumans. Now then, the three names on this list are the ones we believed to be in the country. That's all? That numbers not going to rise? I can't answer that question until these three are captured alive so they can be studied. Which will also tell us how to deal with them. How hard can that be if you've already managed to put this list together. That's only data about who they were before they became posthuman. As soon as symptoms start to show, they don't go anywhere near security cameras or leave any other traces of their whereabouts. Patrick Huge was an exception. [tense music] All right, look. This a battle against the first shared enemy humanities ever encountered. [tense music continues] [exhales] -[inhales, exhales] -[crossing beeps alarm] [inhales, exhales] [inhales, exhales] -Hmm? -[inhales] Can I help you? -[squeals, shrieks] -[woman] Huh? [screaming] [Daisuke] Yesterday, 28 year old, Sanji Yaguchi, one of three posthumans to have manifested in Japan, was captured on camera committing yet another murder. [Ishikawa] Hmm? Film? Those were taken accidentally by a freelance journalist. Since it wasn't digital, it explains why Yaguchi didn't realize he'd been photographed. Yeah, analog cameras for the win. He was a boxer, right? It's not too far-fetched. Is that a prosthetic arm? [Major] Who's the victim? Koichi Tadokoro, age 49, vice minister for immigration services. A vice minister? What the hell's the motive? [Daisuke] I'd say your guess is as good as ours. So, we got a world-class boxer turned posthuman. Launching his own sustainable war against the country using only his fist. If his fist was replaced with a prosthetic, isn't there a chance we'd find other murders with the same MO? I'd wager. The odds are high. The fact that he's a posthuman with a highly specific calling card will help us pinpoint his whereabouts. Search for all crimes with a matching MO. We track down Sanji Yaguchi. TOKYO RECONSTRUCTION PROJECT 2050 [Ishikawa] From all appearances, our man Tadokoro was a conscientious civil servant. He oversaw legislation dealing with immigrants and refugees. [Togusa] And you said he disappeared the night before his title match? I have no idea if this is relevant or not. But a little while before Sanji disappeared, at his final training camp for the world title, he came down with a real bad fever. [Purin] I poured you all similar cases that occurred in the country over the past three months. I focus mainly on crime lab reports. And then I have this great idea to compare the autopsy results of those victims' bodies against ours. And guess what, I'm 98 percent sure it was the same perpetrator. [Batou] Ninety-two cases? In the big picture of the war, that's small. That's a hell of a lot more than I was imagining, that's for sure. Which makes me think these killings aren't random. [Purin] Correct. [Purin] The first common factor that linked them all together, was that every single one of them were either immigrants or refugees. So, his targets are basically illegal immigrants. Pretending to be refugees? You would think that at first glance! But one data point is different from the rest. This is most likely the first person beaten to death by Sanji Yaguchi. But he's Japanese. Meet Mr. Ishiwata. He helped all the refugees get there false identities and documentation. [Purin] Once he secure them Japanese citizenship, he received a significant amount of revival assistance money by sending them to Tokyo Rising Project sites as a cheap labor force. Okay, but what makes you think this guy was Yaguchi's first victim? [Purin] Because there were tissue fragments found splattered next to his body that belongs to someone else. And guess whose DNA it was a match for? My working theory is, it was remnants from his hand, which he lost when beat Ishiwata to death. [Major] Leaves me to believe his body wasn't durable enough to handle his updated physical abilities. [Purin] Yes. Now, this is a list I took from the Ishiwata construction database listing all of the identity thieves. After they improperly secure their Japanese citizenship, they began receiving welfare benefits illegally without ever actually lifting a finger for the Tokyo Rising Project. So, he's only killing people who are cheating the system then? [Purin] Probably. Tadokoro oversaw legislations -dealing with refugees, right? -[Ishikawa] Yeah. So, it stands to reason. If Yaguchi's specifically targeting people who are guilty of committing fraud. It's safe to assume Tadakoro had skeleton in his closest as well. I'll do some digging on my end, into the circumstance surrounding those contracts. [Hisata] Hmm. "You're truly is gonna be away from Japan for a while. It will be hard to get in touch with me so, my deepest apologies." [computer beeping] And that's that. [heavy breathing] [heavy breathing, cackles] [groans] [grunts] [grunts] [high-pitched beep] -[gasping] -[cackling] [gasping, pants] [laughing, chattering] [Purin] The day before yesterday, there was a strange incident at Fukuoka International in which a businessman's cyberbrain was completely fried beyond recognition. This is the net traffic log of that moment. [Batou] What's strange about it? [Purin] Before the incident, a massive amount of traffic became focused on this exact point. It's the attack source. And guess where the traffic was headed? If you guess the victim's cyberbrain, you'd be correct. It came from three million different sources. [gasping] What? Are you saying, this was a simultaneous cyber attack by three million individual hackers? [Purin] The culprit somehow temporarily united the will of three million people causing the instant death of the victim. No ordinary human is capable of something of this magnitude. [Major] True, but a posthuman might be able to. Major, how long have you been standing there? Our next target had made herself known. Another posthuman, Suzuka Mizukane, was just picked up on camera. I'll have Saito and Paz meet up with me, we'll look for her. [Togusa] I'll go, too. Ishikawa and Borma, monitor all facial recognition systems around the airport. Roger that. Oh, um… Major… what should I do? I'm sorry, are you a member of Section 9? Eh, eh… not really. Then that means, I have no standing or authority to give you orders. [gasping] [sighs] She didn't have to be so mean about it. -Didn't think you that slow. -Huh? That was her giving you free rein to do what you want. [gasping] Oh my gosh, thank you so much, Major! I won't let you down! [Purin] So, we have a school teacher who vehemently denied bullying was going on in his school. A yakuza lieutenant with ties to a high profile actress whose affair has just been exposed. There's tons of similar mass hacking attacks. However… I can't figure out what connects the victims together. [heavy breathing, panting] [gasping, panting] [Hisata whimpers] What the hell? [Purin] The victim is Tatsuya Hisata, age 34. Assistant Manager in a mid-sized machinery manufacturer. What's going on? Is he running from something? No! [grunts, groans] [grunts, groans] What are you seeing? Come on, give me a clue here. [gasping] He's laughing! Hang on. Wasn't this the same guy spotted at the other crime scenes? That's a bingo. [Chris] You're correct on one account. Tadokoro was a Tokyo Rising Committee intermediary. But, I don't believe he'd ever do anything illegal. His role in this is pretty clear to us. What's less clear, would be why the now posthuman Yaguchi, considers even the very act of sending refugees to the Tokyo Rising Project as a cheap labor force to be an act of corruption worthy of murder. I don't follow. Then let me lay it out for you, Prime Minister. Otomo Industries, over which your father-in-law holds a managerial position, has won a wide range of contracts. Conveniently including construction work under the appointment of the Tokyo Rising Committee. And I don't deny that. But Otomo Industries isn't the only business benefiting from that project. So then, it's safe to make the assumption, there was a revolving door deal with Tadokoro or he accepted bribes. Mr. Aramaki, your accusations are leveled at my father. Not at Tadokoro where they belong. Given that Sachio Otomo is the chairman of the Tokyo Rising Committee, we cannot simply dismiss the possibility without first investigating it thoroughly. [sighs] I'm baffled. To me my father-in-law-- Prime Minister. Our investigation is not focused on potential bribes involving Sachio. Our main concern is to do whatever it takes to bring the posthuman into custody. However, in the event that there has been -corruption within Otomo Industries… -[sighs] …before war, there is no way we can say with certainty, Sachio himself won't become the posthuman's next target. I understand. I'm gonna confront my father-in-law about this matter myself. Until I can do that, give me some time. You shall have it. [gasping, panting] Oh, no! [grunts] [panting] [grunts] [panting continues] I lost her. [Purin] Nope, but nice try. [gasping] Mr. Koji Kogure, I presume. [whimpers] Who the hell are you, lady? I'm with Public Security Section 9. Name's Purin Esaki. [Purin] Peep Hole? Yes, ma'am. It's an app that lets you view what the target is seeing from their perspective but as an outside spectator. [chuckling] [Purin] What's with all these faceless monsters? This is why you were at all those crime scenes. To watch these happening to the victims in real time. [Kogure] You can only watch if you're there in person. With the "King" as an exception, of course. [Purin] King? Would that be the ring leader behind these hacks? [Kogure] Yes, everyone calls him the Nameless King. [Purin] I wanna know more about these Nameless King. Tell me everything you know about this guy. [Kogure] That won't be necessary. [gasping] Hang on, am I talking to the King now? [in altered voice] The very same! Now a question for you. Do you have the courage to step through that door, Miss Purin Esaki? -[exhales] -[clanks] [screams] [groans] Aah! [in normal voice] Didn't have to pull me? [in altered voice] So, Ms. Esaki. What do you most wish to ask about? Knowing my true identity, for people. Well first off, I want to know what all these attacks are about? Ah, I suppose I need to start by telling you first about Think Pol's existence. Think Pol? It's the name of the system -designed with the sole purpose of-- -[King] …designed with the sole purpose of bringing about a just world. Think Pol's rules are actually very easy to grasp. It starts by first selecting a target. Think Pol locks on to the web user who's the focus of the most collective hate at that particular moment. Once the target has been selected, it poses the following question to the general public. "Should this individual be forgiven of their crimes or are they guilty and deserving of an appropriate punishment?" [Purin] You're saying the identity of the three million attackers in the Hisata case was… Huh! [screams, pants] It's the combined forces of those who declared him guilty. We are both judge and jury. [laughing] [King] This is democracy. Merely carried out to its logical extreme! No, you're wrong. It's orchestrating nothing more than a witchhunt. Explain to me why that's wrong. [gasping] Because no one in this country has any faith in our old justice system anymore. So, just like that, you'll fry his cyberbrain? If that's the will of the people, yes. There will? But they can choose the wrong path. The wrong path? This country is already walking down and it shows no sign of turning around. [Major] You don't think maybe -you're the one taking the wrong path? -Huh? Shinya Uotori of Shuseikan High School year two, class three, student number two. [boiling] [gasping] -[gasping, sniffs] -Shinya, can I come in? What is it? Hurry up, I'm studying. Your little friends stop by to say hello. What…? [gasping] Pardon us. Are you… here to arrest me? Why would we arrest you? -Because I created the Think Pol program. -[scoffs] Don't get me wrong, at first we thought you did mastermind this entire plan. The man behind the curtain. But then nobody who can write a code like that would let us trace him so easily and let himself get caught. [grunts] What do you expect? I'm just a kid! [sighs] We didn't expect that impressive peeping app that's for sure. You wrote that one, right? Uh, uh… I did. So, mind explaining how you got your hands on the initial Think Pol software? I found it on the server. At the junior high school I went to. We were the first ones accessed by Think Pol to fry someone's brain. We being the students. [Shinya] It was popular with parents. So, the headline was written up as "Passionate well-loved teacher meets a violent end." And everybody who went to that school knew how big a scumbag Yamada was. Everyone! That's when it hit me. Whoever wrote Think Pol, must have also been a student at that school. Right after Yamada's death, I was poking around the Sakanoshita's server. And it was just sitting there. I released it onto the net to be shared with the world. [Major] Its code is beautiful. [Shinya] That's true the code itself. But I was drawn to something else. Who ever developed this code just gets it. Bless your heart. Wait, are you making fun of me? Course not. I'm just saying you and Think Pol creator both strike me as equally ambitious and naive. Ooh! [Major] Well we got confirmation Think Pol's been shut down. Our next move is retrieving that code. So, what happened with Uotori? [sighs] The only statement he gave was, "Losing hope in this country was inevitable. Whoever wrote that code, just lost it first." -Humph! -In any case, he can't be charged -for anything just for writing peepholes. -Humph! Now anyone could casually declare a complete stranger guilty. And the target's life has potentially threatened. Think this is another posthuman act of sustainable war? TAKASHI SHIMAMURA [Yamada] Your teenage years are a stifling part of your life. Until you graduated, "Obey the rules. Do as your parents tell you. No boyfriends or girlfriends." And to top it all off, people who never cut lose when they were young, have little life experience to draw on. So, the crazy idea gets put in their heads that they'll never be real adults no matter what they do. -Mr. Yamada! -Huh? Could we just get a normal math lesson? When it's part of the standard curriculum. Sure. [chuckles] Sorry about that. Guess I, got a little off track there, didn't I? -You're a real straight arrow, Kanami. -[school bell chimes off] -[sighs] -Actually, that's it for today. [indistinct chatter] Kanami. On your lunch break, I'd like to see you on the student guidance office. [faint video game chatter] If only the airborne troopers were here. [video game chatter continues] [sighs] Nothing interesting so far. Datalog shows he's just a normal junior high schooler. I wonder why? Was that really what he had in mind when he wrote Think Pol. Hmm. I mean, he created his exquisitely powerful system. And then after using it one time, he just disappears. It'd be nice if he was held up somewhere. Except it's more likely he's planning another raid. That's true. All right, Togusa and I are gonna checkout Takashi Shimamura's house. -Ishikawa, Borma, Esaki. -[gasps] Keep working on analyzing Think Pol. Let's figure out who their next target is. [in excited voice] Roger that! This should be the happiest time of his life. But now he's a posthuman. What do you suppose that's like for him? Force to fight their war. Based on what we've seen so far, they seem to lose most of their human emotions once they turn. In that case, the kid's mother must be the one taking it the hardest. Ah, it's just the two of them, huh? [Yoshie] Here you go. You didn't have to. So, after Takashi passed out in class. What happened to him? He woke up the next day and he was running a fever of 104. He was in the hospital for almost a week. The doctors told me he might not make it. Almost everyday. This was six months ago, on May 12th, yes? Uh… that sounds right. [Togusa] That was the same day Sanji Yaguchi and the other posthumans turned. [Major] The fact that he was online beforehand is another point in common. [Major] After his fever broke, his appetite changed he could do things he couldn't before. And his personality was suddenly radically different, wasn't it? [Yoshie] Yes. [Major] After that, he went back to school? [Yoshie sobs, sniffling] [Yoshie] As soon as he felt better, yes. [Togusa] 1984… [Yoshie] But… something happened while he was sick. Something devastating to the whole school. [dramatic music] [Togusa] Do you think his classmate's suicide is related to him running away? No, not as far as I know. I don't think they were close, he never mentioned her. Considering Takashi's age, it is possible he was keeping his feelings for her a secret. I don't think that sounds like him at all. Although… I wonder… he stayed home from school for three days after that. And what did he do then? He spent the whole time in front of his computer. He didn't even stop to eat or anything. He went three whole days without eating? Yes. He went to school the next day. And I haven't seen him since. [Purin] Takashi Shimamura has been spotted within 200 meters of your current location. [Togusa] He's close. He let someone see him. [Togusa grunts] [Togusa] He wouldn't be doing this if he didn't know we were here. [Purin] The encryption on our comms can only keep out of posthumans for a minute, tops. Shut off your cyberbrains and get out of there now! Is um… something wrong? [doorbell rings] [grunts] -[tense music] -[gun safety clicks] [gasping] [Purin] He's close. I'm picking him up right outside of the front door. [clanks, beeps] [clanks] [grunts] [door creaks] [gasping] [creaks] [grunts, pants] [Purin] Major, the signal disappeared! [Batou] Fallback! You got to get out there, we don't what he'll do. [Major] Understood. What is it? There is something wrong with him, isn't there? Right now, we believe your son is close. What? However, we think Takashi Shimamura has changed. He's no longer the person you used to know. Huh wait… what are you saying? We can't explain why, but our organization has reason to believe, that your son may very well be on the verge of carrying out an act of terrorism. Major! [gasping] Takashi is… he's a terrorist? He may not do it directly, but it's entirely possible he's going to do something that could endanger many people. That's why if he makes any attempt to reach you in any way, -we need you to contact us immediately. -[sobs] [sobbing] [in strained voice] Why is this happening? [sobbing continues] [Yoshie] Takashi… Takashi, I'm so sorry. [sniffling, sobbing] -[alarms buzzing] -[Togusa] What? -[alarm blares] -[grunts] What… what's going on? Mr. Togusa, are you all right? It won't shut down! What happened? Togusa! What the hell are you waiting for? Only way to kill a virus like that is an offensive barrier. [alarm halts] [nervous gasp] -[soft grunt] -[nervous exhale] What happened? Looks like our hero here has been trying to fly solo. Analyzing files he took from Shimamura's house to get a feel for how the kid thinks. And he found some code in those files that was written after Think Pol was. A virus? We're not really sure. -[gasping] -[Batou] Hey. -[gasping continues] -[Batou] Togusa, are you okay? -Big guy, hey. -Hi. You're here too, Major? [gasping, grunts] [groans, grunts] Sorry. I was seeing a whole bunch of long-forgotten memories. And a second later, all I felt was terror. I'm pretty sure that's why I passed out. [Ishikawa] Major, I have the inspection results of that code in Togusa's cyberbrain. [Major] What did you find? [Ishikawa] Well, it's interesting. There's a program designed to reawaken memories buried deep in the user's subconscious. [Batou] What about you guys? [chuckles] Hey, what was so offensive to his delicate mind? Let's take a look. [all chuckling] -[Togusa] Cut me some slack. -[Batou] Huh? Even I can't figure out -what the hell I saw in there. -Hey, it's really Togusa! Huh? Be quiet! -[groans] -[grunts] [nervous chuckling] Ishikawa, you find anything? [grunts] Unfortunately not. Some of the code has been lost. [Major] Where do you put the threat level? -[Ishikawa] Probably not too high. -[Major] Hmm. Besides, I didn't find any signs that server been released outside of Togusa's system. [Major] If that's the case, why would Shimamura have written that program? Especially after he made Think Pol. Major. I have a thought. Stop me if I'm crazy. Maybe he was trying to recall one of his own forgotten memories. [Togusa] Look at the name Think Pol. I'm guessing he got that from the "Thought Police" from George Orwell's 1984. He had a copy of it hidden under his bed. So, obviously that book had a pretty big impact on Takashi. But here's the thing, he had that book by the time he was nine years old. I asked his mom and she told me she doesn't remember where he got it. Maybe, neither does he. [Major] Hang on, you went back to the Shimamura's after we left? Uh… well… yeah. -That Togusa is so detailed. -[Batou] Unbelievable. Uh-huh! At any rate, that still doesn't leave us with any leads to track this kid down. [Togusa] Maybe not, actually. When he was nine years old, he spent a month staying with his aunt and uncle in Kyoto. I'm thinking if he wrote a program to dig up lost memories that have been deliberately forgotten. Stands to reason, he did it so he could remember something buried in his past. It seems like you're jumping to conclusions. But it's not impossible. [Togusa] Major, I want to go there to follow up on this. [Major] If that's what your ghost is whispering to you, don't let me stand in the way. There's probably something to it. KYOTO 15 MINUTES [ominous music] [Ishikawa] That's the place. -I guess Takashi Shimamura's uncle… -Whoa! -…was here at the similar time. -Whoo! Why did he come stay here anyway? His father was dying in the hospital and his mother told me she didn't wanna leave her husband's side. [Tachikoma] Ooh! [Tachikoma] Huh? -[door rustling] -[grunts] [groans] -[high-pitched feedback] -What… [grunts] [high-pitched feedback continues] Togusa? [gasping] Hmm? [static] [Yuzu] Hey, brother, what are you doing? I told you, I'm not your brother. [Uncle] Yuzu, where's Takashi? He's over here, daddy! [in whispered voice] I don't know why but lately, mommy and daddy are mad all the time. [in normal voice] Because I'm here. [in whispered voice] Why would they be mad that you're here? -[dog barking in distance] -[Takashi grunts] [Yuzu] She's not coming back. [Yuzu] Why isn't anyone willing to speak up for her? Are they afraid? They think if they show courage like she, did they'll be ostracized? Hey, Togusa. What's up? Nothing… uh… Hmm? [Yuzu] Takashi! Where are you going? You're not supposed to go that way. 'Cause that's where the parry-trooper lives. [Takashi] Parry-trooper? [Yuzu] An old guy who came from out of town. They say he's a really bad man. He kills people and buries them in the mountains. [Batou] Hey, Togusa, where the hell are you going? [exhales] Found it. Right there. [Batou] Come on. [sighs] Huh? [radio static, beeps] Hmm. -[Yuzu] Brother… -[static, indistinct chatter] Look. -[thuds] -[grunts] [Uncle] You took Yuzu out there with you? Why did you go to the airborne trooper's house? -Takashi didn't take me with him. -[grunts, coughs] I followed him on my own. [Uncle] You stay out of this! [Takashi] If someone did do something… It's not like anybody would take them for it. [indistinct chatter] Maybe… But I think Kanami would be grateful. [stammers] I… I didn't mean to steal this from you. I just walked up for it by accident. I… I'm so sorry! I'm gonna let you keep the book. -[gasps] -What's written in there is about to happen at everyone, everywhere. All over the world. Whoa. [gasping] Yuzu! The war is starting. Just like I told you! [plane engine roars in distance] -[clamoring] -[panting] STUDENT GUIDANCE ROOM [Takashi] The three slogans of the party, "War is peace." "Freedom is slavery." "Ignorance is strength." [cars approaching] Hmm? -[man] Get up. -[hooded man gasping] -Give me a hand! -[indistinct chatter] [Takashi gasping] -[man] Let's go, move it! -[hooded man] Please… [all gasping] -Takashi. -Don't just stand there, let's go! [Yuzu] Takashi? Where are you? Daddy said the policemen was working up here. So, you really shouldn't -go into the mountains. -Yuzu? Yuzu! -[gun cocks] -[both gasping] -Yuzu, run! -[nervous gasping] -[grunts] -Yuzu! Get up! [Yuzu] Brother… [sighs] [Kanami gasping] Takashi! Kanami! No, don't! -[gunshot] -[grunts] [vehicle approaching] [Takashi gasping] [grunts] [Togusa] Huh! [panting, sobs] Yuzu? Yuzu, are you all right? Yuzu? [Takashi] Yuzu? -[gasping] -[Yuzu] Brother… I'm… I feel… -…so, cold. -[Takashi] Yuzu… [sobs] [tragic music] "War is peace." "Freedom is slavery." Yuzu… [sobbing] [tragic music continues] [engine sputters] [in strained voice] Please, take me with you. -[paratrooper] Not a chance. -[Takashi] Please help me! Yes, war is peace. Freedom is slavery. [tragic music continues] -[gasping] -[Takashi] At that time… I didn't understand. But I do now… I've read that book cover to cover! All right then. Get in. [Yuzu] Brother… You did it, Think Pol really worked. That's great. Now we can use it to bring justice to everyone who deserves it. No. Brother? [Yuzu] Where are you going? [Takashi] I'm not really sure. [inhales] But it's where we all want to go. [in altered voice] Do you want to come with us? Huh? [Ishikawa] Tachikoma, it's me. Is Batou there? Yep, he's right here! -Batou, Ishikawa wants to talk to you. -Yeah? Ishikawa? Put him through. [grunts] Huh? Hey. Togusa? Togusa… he's gone. Huh? What are you talking about, Mr. Batou? Togusa is standing right there. Where? The hell are you talking about, he's not here. You're screwing with me? Of course not, Mr. Batou. We'd never do anything like that especially not to you. -Oh, okay Togusa. Roger that. -Huh? -See ya! Bye-bye. -It's not funny! -Bye-bye! -[Batou] Hey, Togusa? Where are you? Togusa! [ominous music intensifies and stops] Have you been able to track down Togusa yet? We've been using the IR system to run facial recognition. But if he's moving around like a posthuman it will be tough. Maybe we'll get lucky. I see. I've also given the order for some of our people to work with security. All we can do now is wait. Well, unless he's held up in the mountains, he's bound to pop up somewhere. [car door opens, closes] [exhales] [both] Welcome, sir. [gasping] -[ominous music] -[indistinct mutter] Representative? -[ominous music continues] -[geisha] Sir, is something the matter? We have an emergency. -Please, tell us what's wrong? -Otomo has been killed! You're saying, there's not even a face left to identify? [Akiko] No. [sniffles] At least… They said it happened so quickly. He probably didn't feel any pain. [sobbing] [man on radio] Alert, sixth district jurisdiction… …deaths due to an intentional hydrogen explosion… [Ishikawa scoffs] Too bad we can't borrow the eyes of bystanders like the Americans do. Oh, damn it! What are you sitting around for? Put out a fake news story immediately. Hide the existence of the posthuman! Don't forget that's your job. What a wasted opportunity if I ever heard of one. This posthuman was foolish enough to be lured out by the bribery scandal and revealed himself. How'd you know that? Did you have my office bugged? I can't very well have you keeping secrets from me now, can I? Do you want to be arrested for espionage? Arrested? And here I was under the impression we were both fellow countrymen working together. Mr. Aramaki, release a statement that my father-in-law's death was due to a… sudden illness. Prime Minister… And one other thing. In order to lure out the posthuman, I want you to release a piece of real news. [drones buzzing] [reporter] Upon receiving news of his father-in-law's sudden death, Prime Minister Tate announced he would be assuming chairmanship of the Tokyo Rising Committee. Will Omoto Micronics, which Prime Minister Tate holds stocks in, receive improper contracts in the Tokyo Rising Project? Reports suggest they'll have a monopoly over soil contamination cleaning micro machines. [gasping] Honey! -[Chris exhaling] -[Akiko sobbing] He's brave I'll give him that. [Batou] It's to say that even if he's an old-school politician, at least he's not America's puppet. [clamoring, indistinct chatter] POLICE HOSPITAL -All right stand back. -Can we get through… Huh? Hey, check this guy out. That's definitely him! -[alarm blares] -[both gasping] [Tachikoma] Mr. Batou, it looks like it's starting! Shit! We're too late. [alarm continues to blare] [groans] [guard] Huh, what just happened? [security] Something's going down at the back entrance. [groans, grunts] [groans] [in hoarse voice] What are you after, Prime Minister? [heavy breathing] [in normal voice] This is my home and I genuinely love this country. [percussive music] In order to restore it to all of its former glory, I'm willing to do whatever it takes. Are you all right? [grunts] [action music] Don't shoot! [action music continues] [dings, grunts] [groans] Come one, Major. Why are you boxing him? He'll kill you! [dings, grunts] [grunts] [grunts] [zaps] That was a crazy stunt. [exhales] I was willing to bet that some part of Yaguchi before he turned posthuman was still in there. And that I could take him if he took the bait. I wasn't wrong, was I? [Akiko] Oh, what's going on? Why don't you go inside and get some rest? Prime Minister. Why didn't Yaguchi attack? He had the chance too. [sighs] I'm wondering if he came in order to see how serious I was. About this country and Tokyo's rebirth. If that's true, then what does he want? Well done. But my men and I will take it from here. [Batou] Sure, you will. [John] I suggest you remember one thing. Your mission is to apprehend the posthuman. Anything beyond that is none of your concern. Unfortunately, this is just how things are now. But that's why I became Prime Minister. To change it. [sighs] -Ooh! -[phone rings] -Ooh! Huh! -Mr. Batou! It's the phone! Who's calling? -Whoa! -Hmm? -It's from a payphone! -Huh? A payphone? There sure are some retro hipsters out there these days. What do you want us to do? [exclaims] Answer it. Roger! [phone continues to ring] Ah! Hello? -[man] Tachikoma? -Hmm? -That sounds like… -Could it be? -Togusa! -Mr. Batou! -It's Togusa! -Hmm! -What, really? It's Togusa? -[squeals] -Here. -Togusa, is that you? [Togusa] Hey, big guy. I… I don't believe it. You're still alive? [Togusa] Yeah. Don't know how. [Batou] Where are you now? Say, big guy… Can being alive… really make the world look this beautiful? [air siren blares in distance] Huh?
