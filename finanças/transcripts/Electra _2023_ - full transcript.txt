It was my tenth birthday. It was my tenth birthday. And my friends were invited to the party. Happy birthday, Electra. Happy birthday. So cute! My mum did my makeup. All the girls at the party were super jealous. - Beautiful! - Amazing! - So beautiful! - Wow! Our mothers are calling yours to ask… Do you really let her wear makeup? I'd rather teach her now to do it right… with expensive cosmetics, …than to see her use all kinds of cheap chemicals ruin her skin, - …and go around badly made up. - …and go around badly made up. - So cool… - Cool… - Happy birthday to you! - Happy birthday to you! Happy birthday, dear Electra! Happy birthday to you! Someone is missing! Someone is missing. - What did she say? - I don't know. - No one is missing. - What did she say? - No one's missing. - I don't know. - What did she say? - No one's missing. - What did she say? - Someone is missing? No one is missing. NO ONE IS MISSING! Some more cake? More sugar? I was baking all night… so it would be ready for breakfast. We ate birthday cake… …all morning, all day. All… night. Do you like it? Is it… sweet enough? Four cups of sugar. Four cups of cream. Four cups of strawberries. Some more cake? All morning. All day, birthday cake. We ate birthday cake. Do you like it? Some more cake? Do you like it? Do you like it? Strawberries… Electra? Would you like some cake, sweetie? Welcome, Electra. - Take a seat. - Make yourself at home. So, who wants to start? Hi, my name is Electra. - Hi Electra! - How are you? - Welcome, Electra. - Nice to meet you, Electra. My mother… …always had lots of great, expensive cosmetics. Father was always buying them for her. I was never allowed to touch them. It was my tenth birthday… …and… - I wanted to surprise… - Electra? Well… who's next? Hi, I'm Electra, and it's my birthday today. - Oh really? - Happy birthday, Electra! My father gave me a doll every birthday. - So cute! - They were so beautiful! Y'know, they had such slim waists, beautiful breasts… - I like to undress the dolls! - What? - Electra! - Ew! No way! When I undressed them, I felt… y'know… …tingling… …down there. I was, like… "Um, what's that?" "I never felt like that before." I wore a bra when I went to bed. I stole it from my mum's closet. I know! Y-you thought that if you wore a bra every night… …you'd get breasts like the dolls! - Look! Wow! - Look at this! - What a pair! - Whoa! …and I believed, if I wore heels every night, I'd have feet like the dolls! One day I wanted to surprise my father, and cut my hair. - To give yourself bangs! - I'm sure he'd like it! Because your mom had them! Daddy, please comb my hair. It is so nice. Where is your mom? She's baking the birthday cake. Electra! Electra! Don't cry. I made a cake for you. Happy birthday, Electra! It was your fault. You weren't good enough. - You weren't good enough. - YOU WEREN'T GOOD ENOUGH! I'm a good girl… I'm a good girl… Electra? Electra… No… Electra. Nooo! Electra! You ate the whole birthday cake? Look at your teeth! I'm a good girl… I'm a good girl… Everybody in our town knows our dentist, Agamemnon. Let's ask him what he thinks about sex. Sex is like… picking your nose with your finger, except… …you're picking somewhere else, with something else. Something… …like picking your nose! Something else, Electra! Something else! Something else, Electra! Something ELSE! It was my tenth birthday, and I wanted to surprise my father, and cut my hair. I gave myself short bangs. I was sure he'd like them. He shouted at me. But this time, words weren't enough for him. He didn't expect that I'd have a black eye. My friends were invited to the party. And… …mother carefully and very professionally did my makeup, so that nothing was visible at all. I totally loved it, and I felt gorgeous. Father wasn't at the party. He left us that morning.
