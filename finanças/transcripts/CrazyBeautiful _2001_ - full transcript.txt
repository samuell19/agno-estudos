I remember most of 17. I remember the day we met. His smile, his touch. You could be anywhere when your life begins...

Oh, oh, Nicole is here. Do you want to say something to her? Bye. He's late for a meeting. Come on, sweetie. We'll go to the doctor and get your rash all better. What's the evil stepmom's problem? Oh, major crisis. Morgan has a rash. Oh, my God. Where's the ambulance? # Today # like any day # rolled out of bed # talked on the telephone # # went to the doctor # she said, you're ok # still, I wonder # who am I? Oh. Oh, that's just great. # Who am I? Oh. # Who am I? # Today # in the air # on the water # ships pass you by # clouds fantasize # driving shapes across the sky # # wondering why oh, my God. # Who am I? Oops. Hi. Oh, God. I hate this place. Yeah. I'm already up for ditching. For sure. Shit sucks. Shakespeare was, in many ways, ahead of his time. He had psychological depth that is only in this century beginning to be fully understood. Yes? Bathroom? Me, too. Take a pass. Oh, thank you. Both at a time when only a queen... All right, so the British are trying to reestablish their authority over their precious colonies. It's as if they're trying to assert a right that they couldn't quite exert. Assert and exert. Anybody know the difference between "assert" and "exert"? What does it mean in this case? Anybody? Well, it means they could write the laws, but they couldn't enforce them from 3,000 Miles away. Bingo, Carlos. They're 3,000 Miles away, and they're trying to establish their authority over their colonies. They are trying to reestablish their mercantilist philosophy, which was, "we got colonies, and we're here to milk them." How were they doing this? Well, grenville, the man in charge under George the third... # Once in a house on a hill # # a boy got angry # he broke into my heart # # so I came down the hill # # of course I was hurt # but then I started to think # # it shouldn't hurt me to be free # # it's what I really need # to pull myself together # # but if it's so good being free # # what you are telling me # # why I don't know what to do with myself # Hey. Hey, come here. I got to get back to class. No. Come meet my friends. Hi. Come on. What, are you scared? It's Carlos, right? Right. Break me off some of that shit. This is maddy. Hi. Hi. That's lainie. Hi. Foster. Curtis is in the tree. What's up, man? Carlos and I met when I was giving back to the community. Oh, he was on the chain gang with you? No. Ha ha ha. Just an innocent bystander. You want some? Nah, that's ok. Come on, it's good for you. Trust me. # So I loved the boy # no cholesterol damn! With a kick. What's in this? Oh, shit. Give me this. What's going on? Hey. Well, what do you know? My all-time favorite people in the world to bust. Hello, Mr. Kane. How's it going? Hey, this is a student council meeting. I got too much stress in my life. Ask the mental health center people. They told us to take breaks. What is this? Who's this belong to? Not us. You don't know anything about this, right? I got a pass. What, a drinking pass? You guys, let's go. Clear out. Hey! Aah! Hey! Hey! Guys! Cut it out. Come on, this is detention. Hey. This is how we first met. What? Picking up trash. Just let me do the work, ok? Sure. 3, 2, hut! You got it! Good job. Carlos. What? I'm sorry. Yeah, well, so am I. No, I really am. Come on, it's just detention. You're not going to be scarred for life. You may even still get into college. Look, you guys play around at being bad-ass, which is cool. All right, whatever. But it's not like that for me, ok? I get on this bus, all right? This piece of shit, stinking bus, 2 hours each way, just to be here. At 5:43 in the morning... that's what time my bus leaves. So if I wanted to screw up, I'd do it at my home school, because I'd get a hell of a lot more sleep. But I'm here, ok? I'm here because I really want to be here. And you, you're here because... Why are you here, if it's such a big joke to you? I don't know. Ask my father. What? Nothing. Why were you on the beach? Beach? Yeah. You didn't rob any 7-Eleven. Oh. D.U.I. I got stopped coming home from a club. Damn, that's pretty stupid. Yeah. Didn't seem stupid at the time. Then again, I was wasted. I don't know, man. Just... Just don't play me, ok? I won't play you. I don't want to be played. Ok. I won't. I'm not going to play you. Ok? I promise. Luis, on the inside. Luis, on the inside. Nunez, where the hell you been? Detention, sir. Detention? You pay me back after practice. You give me an hour in that weight room. Let's go! On the ball! All right, man, I'm outta here, bro. We're not supposed to leave until 6:30. Dude, there's no one here, man. We can leave whenever. Tss. Aw, you're a trip, Nunez. I'll see you later, homey. Damn. Missed the bus. Detencion. It's no big deal, mom. All right. I got it. No. I got it. Ok. Let me just talk to my girl, and I'll call you right back. Ok. Bye. Uhh! Ok, here's the plan. Derek knows this party in the colony, but he's not exactly invited. But he thinks that if he hooks up with us... Whoa. That way, he can for sure get in, because we're just so irresistible. You know, there's a football game. A what? A football game. I heard you. The pacific game? Yeah. Football? What? It'll be fun for a goof. Come on. Oh, my God. You're so obvious. What? What? What? What? What? What am I obvious about? Slut.

What's happening at Carmen's? Hey, free cerveza, free food. Maybe some other free stuff, you know what I'm saying? Yeah. You faked that guy out so bad, when he hit the ground, I could've swore he sittin' on himself. Hey, he didn't see nothing but your ass cheeks, man. Good game, you guys, all right? Hey, all right, coach. Hey, stay out of the strip club, man. Man, you like that, don't you? Come here, hot stuff! Hey, say hello to your wife, coach. I'll see you guys later.

Hi. You guys come to get me in trouble again? Uh, no. We're off-duty. We're not troublemakers. We're innocent. Yeah. Look at our faces. Don't we look innocent together? So, What'd you think of the game? What game? It's going to be like that, huh? So, what are you doing tonight? I got to catch the bus. I got work tomorrow. Aw. That sucks. Hey, we can take you home.

She speaks English. Espanol, Por favor. Spanish is hot. Ohh. And to drink? Mmm. This is, like, the best food I've ever had. I know. Yeah? Oh. Ok, where do I go pee at? Whoa. Hey, you know what? You're shit out of luck. Shut up. Fine. I'm just going to pop a squat somewhere. There's no bathrooms around here. Please come with me. Come with me. Are you serious? Yes. I have to go so bad. You're going to pop a squat? - Where? - Anywhere. All right, just go down there. No way. This is, like, rapes are us. No, it's not. Just go down there. You're coming with me. Look, it's dark.

I'm not going to die. I'm not going to jail. I am so not like that. There's some very interesting rumors going around about Friday night. Oh, really? Uh-huh. I heard the word "furpile" more than once. I did nothing to discourage these rumors. Ow! Watch where you're going, you stupid bitch. What? What's your problem? You're my problem. Hey, it's all good.

Don't move. Hey, rosa. Hi. Bye, rosa. Bye. Oh, shit. What? What's wrong? Who's that? Who's what? That guy right there. Oh, that? That's my dad. It's ok. He's, like, right there. He doesn't care. I can do anything. I've got a condom. He'd be so proud. I'm serious. He'd be thrilled I'm sleeping with you. A person of color in his daughter's bed. Man, you're crazy. You're beautiful. Ok. But can I do one more thing? What? I want to kiss you one more time. Where are you? Where are you? Hi, there. Who's the princess on the floor, huh? Nicole, please do not park your car in the motor court because it drips oil everywhere. We just came from a dance show... dance recital. You look pretty. So... Ow, ow, ow, ow. Oh, be careful. You're... you're going to mess up the costume. I really want to keep this neat... dress neat. Mommy. Thank you. Hi, there. Tom oakley. Oh. Carlos Nunez. Hi. How are you? You're rosa's nephew? No, dad. Carlos and I go to school together. Oh. Oh, you're a senior, too. Yes, sir. Just finishing up. Oh, that's wonderful. Do you have any plans for next year? Dad, don't interrogate him. I'm not interrogating him. That's ok. Um, I'm applying to the naval academy. Annapolis? Ooh, that's impressive. That's a tough school. Yes, sir. I want to be a pilot. A pilot? Yeah. The naval fliers are supposed to be the best in the world. Yeah, well, you'll get a great education there no matter what you decide to do. Good to see someone with a plan. So, who's sponsoring you? Um, well, I've written to Roy ball... oh, yeah? Lucy? Yeah, but she hasn't responded yet. Yeah, well, she's still tied up with that ins fiasco, and she probably won't get to it before Thanksgiving. Right. Yeah. So, why didn't you write to me? Tom oakley. Oakley? R-right. I mean, she didn't even tell me. Nicole didn't tell you I was a congressman? No! Nicole didn't think it was relevant. Actually, I think I did write to you. Oh? What'd I say? No word yet, sir. Ha ha. Well, I'm sorry about that. Maria probably hasn't gotten to my stack yet, either. Tom? Morgan wants to eat with her daddy. Ok. Can you hurry? Ok. Here. Why don't you call the office, and we'll set up a meeting? You can come in, tell me all about yourself, and I'll see what I do. Thank you, sir. Thank you. Say, why don't you two stay for dinner? I mean, rosa's cooking up some of her famous stuffed Chile rellenos. "Rellenos" means "stuffed." Thank you, Nicole. And we can't stay. Well, perhaps another time, then. Glad to meet you, Carlos. Nice to meet you, too, sir. Take care. God, I hate when he pulls that. Pulls what? That act. That "oh, I used to march with Cesar Chavez." "Oh, I'm every poor man's best friend." It's so fake. Well, he seemed cool. "Oh, why don't you stay for dinner? We're having Chile rellenos." "Oh, did I show you my electric car?" Come on. And what about you? "Yes, sir." "No, sir." I mean, what is that? You don't have to do that around him. I was raised to do that, ok? It's not some act. Fine. Why didn't you tell me who your father was? I don't go around advertising my father's profession. I didn't think it mattered. Well, it does matter. Why? Do you know how hard it is to get these guys to sit down and read your letter? Or pick you out of a hundred guys exactly like you? Well, mission accomplished. You got your meeting, and you didn't even have to sleep with me. Lucky you. I'm sorry. I just... I mean, that was just weird. I'm sorry we were interrupted. Another time? Hmm. If you're lucky. So, pilot Nunez, huh? Yeah, well, we'll see. What do you mean? I mean, I've never even been in one. In what? A plane. You're joking. You've never been in a plane before? No. Oh, my God. What's so funny? That's cute. Cute. It is. I had a good time today. Me, too. So, anyways, Brian's been awol for, like, 4 days. He hasn't called. He totally changed his cell phone. What are you going to do if he calls? I don't know. What would Jesus do? No, seriously. Remember when I went code blue on that ept, and he freaked out because he thought I would, like, tell his wife? Like, that guy so can't handle pressure. So I'm sure he's just, like... Carlos. Oh, ok. Leave your best friend right when she's baring her soul. Hey. Hey. How's it going? Good. You busy Saturday? Saturday. Yeah, I've got to work in my Uncle's shop. Too bad. What? I just thought we could have some fun together. Oh, man, I don't know. Come on. My dad's not invited, Carlos. Just you and me. I don't know. It's just my Uncle kind of needed me, you know what I mean? Yeah. I promise, promise, promise you, though, a very satisfying experience. You won't be disappointed. Mmm, ok. I got you. No peeking. I'm not. Hold on. Ok, now you can look. Whoa. Want to join the mile-high club? What? I'm kidding. Whoo! Here we go. Aah! Aah! # We stand # to lose # every color from the sky # # then crawl # as a child so, can I take over? Sure. Go ahead. It's yours. Oh, God, you're letting him take over? Ohh. # There's no longer shine # # on this bird of prey you're doing great. He's going in the naval academy. All right. Maybe. I haven't been accepted yet. How many hours have you logged? None. None? He's a natural. You mean in an actual plane? In a real plane. How many hours you got? None. I have a flight simulator at school. Oh, a flight simulator. Like a chair pilot. Pretty much. Yeah, all right. Can I do a lazy 8? It's your airplane. Go ahead. What's a lazy 8? Start it to the right. Oh, my God! Oh! Ha ha ha! Go ahead. Turn it back to the left a little. I'm loving it. Look at me. I'm busy. Wait. Whoo! Oh, my God. I can see my house. Where? Do you see it? Right there. Want me to go drop you off? # We know thank you. # We're running head-on # into our bent and back around to the left. # Future it's a disease of the week benefit. They have to stay until he's shaken the hand of every person in the room. We got until at least midnight. We is all alone. What'd you do? Made it Carlos friendly. # I want to believe in # I want to believe in us # when everything is wrong # # will you come through? # Come through not what I thought it'd be like. No? Mm-mmm. But you thought about it? Yeah. Look how good our skin looks next to each other. It's beautiful. Hmm. Who's that? Oh. My mom. She lives in Virginia. She's married to some dermatologist, and the guy's home at 6:00 every night. It's a big plus for my mom. When she was married to my dad, he was always running around trying to save the world. No time for his family. She left when I was 12. But it's good for my dad, because he got to marry Courtney, and she's flush with cash from her first marriage. My dad left when I was 5. He couldn't hack it here, so he just went back to Mexico. I don't even have pictures of him. You mad at him? I hardly even think about him. I got plenty of parent in my mom. I got to go. No, you don't. You got to stay. No. My mother's going to kill me if I'm late. Well, just tell her you're staying at a friend's house. Ha ha. What friend? I don't know. I don't care. Make one up. I'm not letting you leave. # When you hold me # like you do # it feels so right # drawn out # I start to forget # how my heart gets torn # when that hurt gets flowin' # # feelin' like I can't go on # # turnin' in circles # time and again where are you going?

Ah. What am I doing with you? I don't know. What are you doing with me? It's just a question. Look what you just got me to do. Ha ha. I don't know, man. When I'm with you, I never know what's going to happen. It's weird because my life is so planned out, you know? I don't know. It's like you don't care what people think, and when I'm with you, you kind of make me not care what people think. You know what I'm saying? I know what you're saying. I don't know. And that dimple... I love that dimple. I grew it myself. You did? I grew it myself. # What does he need? # What does he need? # What does he need? Remember us? What's up, fool?

I'm going both ways. I'll make you eat dirt. That's what I'm going to do. Hey, Carlos, man, what's up, bro? What's up, guys? These your homeys? Homeys? Yo, what's so funny, g? I ain't your g, man. Yo, what's up with the attitude, bro? What's with what? Dude, you need to chill, bro. Look, I'm not some banger. I'm not looking to throw down. Then sit the fuck down, bitch. Hey, guys, chill. Whoa.

Are you going to tell me how to talk? Huh? You know what? Let me... mom. Por favor. Ma, Por favor. She busts her ass every day at a shit job for you, ese, not for me. Every day, ese. You owe it to her to make something of yourself. What, because you didn't? Huh? Hey. Carlos. Yeah. You're right. You got it. Let me tell you something, 'Los. I'm not like you, fool. I'm not as smart as you. I'm not as fast as you. You got something that I never had, ese. You got the opportunity to become whatever the hell you want to become, fool. You can be a pilot. You can be a congressman if you want, ese. Whatever you want. And for you to just throw that away for that white girl, that's nothing but... And I'm not going to sit around or to moms anymore, you understand? Look at me, ese. Nicole. Nicole. Look up. What? We got to go. Shit. What? What's the date today? Today? Is today the 17th? I don't know. It's... Shit! What? The meeting with your father... I completely forgot about it. Don't worry. You can reschedule it. I knew I shouldn't have gone to the beach. Don't worry. It's ok. No, it's not ok. Damn. I can't believe I missed it. I'll see you later. You don't want me to come in? It's going to be kind of boring. It's just, like, family and cake and stuff like that. Oh. All right. No, that's ok. You don't want me to. Just hurry up. We're late. I wish I would've known... come on. Hey, that's ok. And a "cheese." Come here, fool. Where you been, man? It's my sister's birthday party. Lost track of time, dawg. Carlos... I lost track of time, mom. You remember Nicole, right? Hi. Ooh! Shut up. I'll be back in a minute. God damn. You're a fool, you know? - Hi. - Hi. Happy Birthday. Thank you. Perfecto. Can I help with anything? No, it's ok. Oh. One second. Ahh. You know I like it buff. Yeah. You know you miss me. What? Hey. Oh. Hey. Where'd you go? I went to change. Oh. Thanks for telling me. Sorry. Luz, this is Nicole. Nicole, luz. Hi. Hey. I like your dress. Thanks. So, you guys go to school together? Yeah. We go to p.H. Together. Oh. That's nice. And you share the same class or what? No. No. We're not... yeah. Well, let's go say hi to my mom. All right. Come on. I'm hot. I'm gonna go outside for a second. Come on. It's ok. What?! Ok. Hold on. Yo, 'Los, it's for you, man. Hello? Where'd you go? What happened? Why'd you leave? I'm so stupid. I don't know what I was thinking coming there. I'm sorry. I should have told you it was gonna be like that. That it was so formal. No. It wasn't that. Just seeing you with your family and your friends and with that girl. She's just a friend. I don't care. You should be able to do whatever you want. I do what I want to do. Oh, God. Look at me, I'm pathetic! I hate myself. What are you talking about? What? It's just... What? What? I just... I think I'm in love with you. I'm sorry. Now I've weirded you out. I'm sorry. No. I... don't say anything. It's ok. It's ok. That's correct, sir. He's leaving for Washington, D.C. in 5 days. Mm-hmm. Uh, well... No, he really doesn't have any other appointments. I would stick with that one. Mm-hmm. Certainly, sir. Take care. Yes. Yes, he is. Mr. Nunez? He's ready for you. Yeah. I have it right here. I think. What is it? A kid... For Gloria, right? Well, we start with the bienvenidos and then the red cross thing. Right? And then... you know, hon? I have a meeting I need to start right now. Why don't we meet at king at 2:30? Ok? Well, you tell me then. All right. Bye-bye. Hey, Carlos. Glad you could make it. How are you? Ok. How are you? You know Carter? Oh, yeah, yeah. You ever work for habitat for humanity? No. It's a good project. We got 25 houses up in a weekend. One easter weekend. And you know father boyle? Yeah. I've heard of him. He's an amazing man. Sit down. We spent some time in boyle heights. It's a tough neighborhood, huh? Yes, sir. I imagine you've seen your share of friends sucked into LA vida loca. Yeah. Not just a Ricky Martin song, is it? No, sir. So, what happened? Uh, what happened? We were supposed to have a meeting last week. I don't know. I got the bus schedule all screwed up, and I was... it was, like, too late. You could have called to say you weren't coming. I... i did call. Maybe she just didn't get you the message. The lady. Maria! Maria! Yes? Did Mr. Nunez call last week to say he wasn't coming in? Not to me. Should I ask Sandy? No, that's ok. I'm more than happy to use my connections to help someone get a foot in the door, but I have absolutely no patience with individuals who will not participate in the process, see? I can't do this alone. Mr. oakley, um... I really appreciate you seeing me today. Ok. I think I know what's going on here. I know the powerful effect Nicole can have on people. She's absolutely fabulous at taking a perfectly-oiled train and running it right off the tracks. Now, I do love her. Unconditionally. That goes without saying. But she can be so destructive. And volatile. And, um, the anger... Ever since... Well, to be 12 years old and to find your mother like that... I think when Nicole's mother took her own life, Nicole decided then and there that she would never, ever trust anyone again. And it was her against the world, and God forbid anybody should try and help her. She's persona non grata with half the psychiatrists on the westside. I mean, a lot of them have recommended that I send her to... One of those behavior modification schools, but I... She's tried to kill herself a number of times, but what can I do? She lies and she drinks. She does drugs. She hates me. Hates her step-mother. Mr. oakley... ahh, Nothin'. I'm sorry. I shouldn't be telling you about this, but you seem like such a good person. Such a decent person. Now, you want me to write this recommendation? You want me to put myself on the line? Well, I want you to listen to my advice. Now, stay away from my daughter. You hear me? For your own good, for my peace of mind, stay away from Nicole. You know, it's a painful thing for a father to... Have to acknowledge a truth about their own child. It's taken me a long time to accept who she is. And who she's never gonna be. # Well, I could sleep forever # # but it's of her I dream # if I could sleep forever # # I could forget about everything # We got a party, man. All them honeys... hey, Carlos, all them honeys gonna be there, man. They gonna be checkin' us out! Hey. Ha ha. Hey. So, what happened? Uh, when? You didn't call me. Oh, I got home late. I just had... Stuff to do. Well, What'd he say? I'll see you guys later. All right. What happened? No, nothing. He just said he was gonna write me a recommendation. But what did he say? About what? About me. Nothing, I mean... come on, just tell me what he said. I... i really don't want to get in the middle of whatever's going on... in the middle of what? Look, I just need to focus right now. You need to focus? Yeah. I can't afford to mess up, man. I told you that. My mom's all over me 'cause I'm never around, and my grades are for shit. I could hardly keep my eyes open at practice. All I want to do is sleep for more than 4 hours straight. I'm sorry for messing up your life. What I'm saying is, I just need to remember what's important. What's important to you? My priorities. What did he tell you? He told me to stay away from you. That you were trouble and that you'd just mess me up. And what did you say? I just... I see. # Every time # it's time to call # in many ways # every dream # gets broken over # with little time # I will fly within your sky # # every time # you start to call # and on the way # all destruction is my wine # # though it's sad and lonely # # there's a whole life waiting after dawn # # gonna slide you can be anywhere when your life begins. You find the right person, then... All of a sudden, anything's possible. I'm eating, mom. I'm just trying to figure this out. Chemistry homework. Hello? Hola, Mrs. Nunez. Soy luz. No estoy aqui. No, no, don't tell her I'm here. I told you, mom, I don't want to talk to her. Because I don't want to. Mira. Tu comida. I'll eat it later. Ay, muchacho. Yeah! Hello? Nicole? Yeah? I need to talk to you. Who is this? You know who this is. I... i can't hear you. Where are you? What? Where are you? I... i can't hear you. Are you at seller's house? I'm just having a good time, ok? And you need to focus. Nicole, I... i really have to... oakley, get off the phone and get in the hot tub, girl. Damn! N-Nicole! I'm gonna go. Nicole, I just want to... take your time. Yeah, hold on. I'll take anyone... Carlos! What's up, Carlos? What's up, baby? Hey, yo, get him a Tequila. Hey, girl, put a titty in his mouth. # None of this makes sense # # they don't support me... # Come on, Nicole, let's go. Whoa, stud. I was just trying to get a taste, man. Shut up, Davis, before I kick your ass! Hey, man, what's your problem? You're my problem! Get down! Hey! What's your problem, bro? Dude, she was having a good time. What's goin' on? What's wrong with you? I thought I was your friend. Hey, man... Just leave, you know that? Get off me, bitch! Shit. Stopping a vehicle with expired tags. 2 occupants. Expired on 6-7-00. Registered to representative Thomas oakley. Good evening, sir. License and registration, please. I don't know where the registration's at. Who does this car belong to? It belongs to her. Where you comin' from tonight? From a party. You been drinkin' tonight? No, sir. Why don't you step out of the car for me for a minute? I just live right off... sir, please, step out of the car for me. John, you check on the young lady. Sir, please step out of the car. Keep your hands up where I can see 'em. Miss, let's go. Let's go. Time to wake up. Let's go. Put your hands up. Time to get up. Wake up. Walk over to the curb, have a seat. Here you go. Step out of the car, please. There you go. Wake up. Sir, the tags are expired on this car. What's your name? Do you know this guy right here? Yeah. Has he tried to hurt you? No, he hasn't hurt me. What are you doing? Why are you touching me? Get the hell off of me! Just calm down. Nicole, stop. No, get the hell off of me! Nicole, stop it! Where are you going? No! He didn't do anything! Makin' it worse for yourself. What the hell is going on?! Get off of me! Stay here. Don't move. Stop! We didn't do anything! Nicole, just calm down! Get off of me! Take her to the car. Put her in the car. What's going on? Hello? Come on in. Good evening, sir. Good evening. We stopped this young man driving your daughter's car. She was intoxicated and combative. We found drug paraphernalia and alcoholic beverage containers in the vehicle. Christ. We thought we'd give you the courtesy of dealing with her yourself. Now, we could put a scare into her and let her spend the night in jail. No. Thank you, officer. I can handle this. No, you can't handle it! Nicole, just calm down. Calm down? Everything is gonna be all right. No, it's not gonna be all right! Look at you. What are you doing... what is the matter out here? Just go back into the house, Courtney. Is she drunk again? Courtney, look, I am taking care of this. How many times do we have to put up with her behavior? Courtney. When is it gonna be enough, for God's sake?! When? Look at you, Nicole. Just look at you. What kind of a daughter are you? Not yours. Thank God for that. This is... Carlos, please, what did I tell you? Just... just go away. Please. Just leave. Go. You hear me? Why do you hate me so much? How could you tell the one person in the world... That I love... That I care about so much, how could you tell him to stay away from me? Do you think the only thing I'll do to anyone is screw them up? Do you think that... That I'm not worth loving? Nicole... Carlos, this is our problem. It's our problem, not yours. Just leave. Go. Come on, son, let's go. Honey, listen, come on to the house... leave me alone! Just leave me alone. Just come in the house, Nicole. No. Just get in the house. Jesus Christ. # Christened life # somehow I found you here # # torn from the hope and fear # # hold us inside # you pulled me out # up from the world I've known # # and all that was broken and cold # # you brought me here the mid-term counts for 25% of your grade, so I want you to pull your thoughts together... Can I help you? # Faith in the life we've done # Ok, where was I? # It holds us inside # Ohh # from you, one look # # just one look # and everything is shattered # # from you, one word # # stars burn and fall # oh # oh Carlos. You need something? # From you, one look # # just one look where you going? # And everything is shattered # Yo, you got a pass. Y... hello? # Towers burn and fall # fall, fall # from you, one look... # What's going on? Packing. Where are you going? Oh. I'm going to the turnabout ranch in lovely escalante, Utah, and I get to be escorted by a lovely gentleman who's waiting for me in the principal's office. So it looks like I get to go to boot camp before you do. Sorry for being so dramatic the other night. It was stupid. I'm sorry for not... oh, don't say anything. You couldn't do anything. You were smart not to say anything. So, Mr. Nunez... It was great knowing you. I hope you have a wonderful life. Let's leave. What? Let's get out of here right now. Aren't you in the middle of an exam? Like right now? So? I'm not gonna let you walk out of your mid-term. I already did. Annapolis is gonna look at these grades. You're not listening to me. I wanna be with you. I don't give a shit about anything else right now. Mid-terms, grades, Annapolis, your father. I wanna be with you. Do you want to be with me? I love you. Don't just say that because... shut up. I love you, ok? You know, this guy in the office... He's pretty damn big. Ha ha. Then... Let's go out on sunset. Oh. Ha ha ha. Come on! I'm coming! # Imagine all walks down the road # # things began to blow, the sky explodes # # the damage is undone # then I know # this has got to be a dream # # strains and luxuries don't lie # Here.

You'll see. That's pretty cool. My shrine to Carlos. Ha ha. Ha ha. Can I see more of it? Yeah, sure. My suicide notes. Creative, huh? Ha. That's your mother, isn't it? Yeah. She... She was in bed asleep, I thought, so I went downstairs, and I stayed real quiet all afternoon so I wouldn't disturb her. And then... I went back up... And she was still lying there. My dad thinks we're the same person. Did he say that? He doesn't need to. What else am I supposed to think, except I'm gonna end up like her? It's genetics, right? Your father, though... He really loves you. He does. No, he doesn't. Nicole, listen to me. He really loves you. He just... He doesn't know how to handle you. I think you scare him. I scare him? You do. I mean, you scare me sometimes. I scare you? I... yes. I mean, you... How do I scare you? You just... Get out of control. I do not. Yes, you do. What are you talking about? You know what I'm talking about. I'm 17. I'm supposed to get out of control. I guess. My dad... He doesn't understand me or... Anything about me. Have you tried talking to him? Yeah. Sober? Shut up. Doesn't happen, does it? I'm not always drunk. Hey. What are you doing out here? I want to be good for you. You a good for me. Not if I keep taking you away from everything you've worked so hard for. I want to make things better for once, not worse. 'Cause I really want to be with you. I can't keep running away from things. I'm here for you. I know you are. Well, do you have a 310 listing for j. Foster? No listing, sir. Well, try b. Foster at 818. That's f-o... f-o-s-t-e-r. No, sir. There's no foster in 818. Should I try the 310 again? Sir? I'm trying to help you, sir. Hello? Well, I've been up all night. Trying to call everybody. I called maddy and lainie and your friend foster, who apparently doesn't believe in telephones. Look, honey, I know you don't want to go to this school, but it's supposed to be extraordinary. Marty sheen says it's top-notch. Dad, I'll... you'll have your own horse. My own horse? Well, you like horses, don't you? When I was 8. Well, the counselor said that... he warned me that you would try to talk your way out of it. He said there's a danger of us getting drawn back into old patterns and destructive behavior, and that we should spend our time focusing on conversations that focus on "we" versus "me." This is "we." Oh. Well, good. Good. I'll go wherever you want me to go. I mean, I know I'm a mess. No, you're not a mess. No, I am. I am a mess. And I'd probably send me away, too. You've got Morgan now and you're gonna do it right this time. I just wish I wasn't the child that everybody learned what not to do from. That's not who you are. I know I remind you of mom. Everything that went wrong, but sometimes you look at me like you wish I wasn't there. Like you wish I'd just disappear. And it just hurts so bad. I know I'm not easy to love, but could you try anyway? I do love you. I love you so much. I'm frightened for you every minute. Every minute. And I need help. I can't do it alone. Tom, honey? Morgan's got her swim class. It starts in 10 minutes. What's going on? That's what we're trying to figure out here. What do you mean figure out? Didn't we agree on a plan of action? Ok, rosa? Would you please take Morgan and put her in the car, please? Thank you. Yes, right now. Oh, my God. This is not gonna start up all over again. She needs discipline. Children need limits. They want limits! So we'll set them. We already have! She's going to that school in Utah. No. I am not the bad guy. This is not about me. I have a child that I'm thinking of. So do I. Two children. Oh, nic... Nicole, I just don't think I can live with you. I know I can't live without her. We have to be at pepperdine in 10 minutes, tom. I'm talking to my daughter. It's Morgan's very first swim class. I'm talking to my daughter. Nicole, I... I just want Morgan to have an older sister that she can look up to. Me, too. That's all right. I've got her now. She's not like mom. No. God, your mom was an amazing woman. She loved you very much. I wish I remembered her better. Hmm. We should talk about her more. We will, honey. We will. Before you say anything, sir, I just want you to know that I love your daughter, sir. Look, you don't have to... she has so much beauty, so much honesty, and I love her so much. Carlos, stop. Now, I have something to say. Thank you. For what? For not listening to me. For sticking around. Annapolis is gonna be lucky to get you. But I had a speech. I had a pretty good speech. I bet you did. You want to hear it anyways? Well, why don't you tell it to her? Seems to be doing pretty good. How did that happen? How did you do that? Do what? I wasn't even there. Yes, you were. You were so there. # I want to believe in # I want to believe in us there are millions of people out there but, in the end, it all comes down to one. I still panic sometimes, forget to breathe, but I know... I know there's something beautiful in all my imperfections. A beauty which he held up for me to see. A strength that can never be taken away. I'm going out to see him next week... But until then... There's one photo I keep with me all the time. # I believe in us # everyone falls # but not everyone rises # why don't you get up # and rise again for me # what if the world were a little more perfect # # would you stop crying # would you take the leap # now, what if the world were a little more perfect # # would you open your eyes # and blink again for me # for me # yeah, for me # what about friendship # what about friends # you said the whole world was against you # # it all had to end # what about love # what about family # what about all that you have to live for # # what if the world were a little more perfect # # would you stop crying # would you take the leap # what if the world were a little more perfect # # would you open your eyes # and blink again for me # for me # and blink again for me # for me # it isn't easy here without you # # why did you leave me # what am I supposed to do # without you # without you # and what if the world were a little more perfect # # would you stop crying # would you take the leap # what if the world were a little more perfect # # would you open your eyes # and what if the world were a little more perfect # # would you stop crying # would you take the leap # what if the world were a little more perfect # # could you open your eyes # and blink again for me # for me # ooh # for me # for me, for me
