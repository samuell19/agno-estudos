[The Barber of Seville overture] [music continues] Oh, no, I'm fine. Thank you. You okay? Yeah. Why wouldn't I be? Did you check up on the kids? No reception. Have you seen, Kim? Kim? No. Why? Scarlett's about to start her speech. Oh. There she is. Jack: Gloria? Jack? -Nice to see you. -Nice to see you, too. This is Jill, my wife. Nice to meet you. I'm Gloria. Jack and Jill, I'm sure you take a lot of flak for that. For what? You know, Jack and Jill... ran up the hill? Oh... This is my husband, Phil. This is Jack, Lulu's vet. Hi. -Well... -Oh. Hello? Is this thing on? Good evening ladies and gentlemen. I just wanted to say a few words before you leave. First, I want to thank all of you for coming, Mayor Grant and all of you who are here to celebrate that Troy is no longer in my life. Screw you Troy! Thanks to his philandering ways I now own this wonderful mansion. And when you choose who to stay friends with, just remember... I got all the money. And talking about friends, this is serious, I'd like to propose a toast to my three best friends since high school. The three-most incredible women I've ever met. Monica, the smartest and fiercest woman I know, who by the way, is also my divorce attorney. Oh, and Kim, my beautiful realtor friend. And last but not least, Gloria, who is not overwhelmed by the pressures of a high-powered job or her appearance, bless her heart... I'm sure she meant it as a compliment. ...because she has all the time in the world to hear me carry on about my problems. Sorry. If it weren't for these three women and our sacred Thursday afternoon get-togethers, I can assure you, I wouldn't be here today. That, and the bipolar medication. Monica, Kim, and Gloria, please join me on stage so we can raise our glasses together. [applause] Who? Oh, wait, wait, wait. Phil. Take one with the phone. [gunshot] [Troy] Where is she? Oh, my god. It's him. Where is she? It wasn't enough for you, was it? It's never enough? You always want more, and more? Troy. What are you doing? Don't move. You don't have to do this. Stay out of it? It's none of your business? I understand what you're going through, but it's not worth it. What the hell do you understand? Everything about her is fake. She was nothing when I met her. I gave her everything. The money, the house, the implants, I made her what she is and this is how she pays me back? You'll meet someone else, you'll make more money. You don't understand. She won't stop until I'm dead. Just give me the gun. Troy. Just give me the gun. I love that bitch. Troy, just give me the gun. [screaming] No, Troy! God! [gunshot] [classical music] Nicky, Bradley. Time to go. Bradley. Can't you read stuff for kids your age? I like it. I need to go. Please. Just three more pages. No. Grandma is outside. Nick? Call me before you go to bed, you hear me? Wait. I love you. Bye. I love you. -Bye. -Bye. Bradley: Shotgun? Nicky: I got it? Wait! Lulu! How many times do I have to tell you to stay out of the trash. You left the trash can open again. [Phil] Sorry. There'll be plenty to drink at the party. Do we have to go? Seriously? I was just thinking that maybe we can stay here and have our own party. Baby, you're wrinkling my suit. That's a nice tie. Is it new? Uh, yeah. It was a gift. From whom? Someone at the office. I miss you. I miss you too. But we can't do this right now. This is important to her. You know that. What's so important about it? It's just another excuse for Scarlett to show off her money. You shouldn't be jealous. You think I'm jealous of Scarlett? Money doesn't mean anything to me. That's because you've always had it. Yes, my parents were rich. So what? Trust me, it's better to be rich and unhappy than poor and unhappy. Is this about my father's will again? What is it that you need? You have a nice house, a nice car, your kids go to a good school. That's not the point, you know it. The point is it's our money, we should be able to do whatever you want with it. It was his money and his right to do whatever he wanted. Maybe you're the one who's jealous of Scarlett. You know how I ended up in Saint Francis with you. A scholarship, I know. My dad got sick working in your dad's coal mines. So when he did nothing but sit around and get drunk all day, my mom had to go to work at Saint Francis as a janitor, just so I could get a scholarship there. I used to watch kids piss all over the walls and laugh at me, telling me my mother was going to wipe that up so I could go to school with them. It's more than money, Gloria. It's dignity. Wait. I'm sorry. Yeah. Are you ready to go? I forgot the present in the office. What wrong with you today? Why are you fighting with me? I'm not fighting with you I just asked you what you two were talking about. How are you two doing? Enjoying the party? Everything is perfect. Thanks. I'm glad. Do you mind if I steal Phil for a couple of minutes? I have a couple of clients I'd like to introduce him to. Okay? Thanks, honey. [classical music continues] -What's wrong? -Nothing. Come on, I'm a lawyer, I can tell when you're lying. I think Phil wants to leave me. Oh. I'm sorry. I just don't understand what I did wrong. I take care of the kids, I cook, I clean. I've sacrificed my whole life for him and I don't even complain about it. Maybe it's not about you. Did he say something? To me? Is he seeing someone else? How should I know? I don't know. You're his oldest friend. I thought he might have... If he's seeing someone I have no idea. I promise. I think it's Scarlett. He's never gotten over her. That was a long time ago and he chose you, didn't he? Yeah, after she dumped him. I don't think anything is going on, Gloria. Really. Now she's divorced and she has all this money, why wouldn't he choose her? Don't say that. He bought two tickets to Buenos Aires. I found the receipt on his computer today. Did you ask him about it? No. Then maybe he's planning a surprise for you. Give him the benefit of the doubt. What are you two gossiping about? Nothing. Oh, you're talking about me then. I'm about to cut the cake. I prepared a speech. I'd like you to hear it. We'll be right there. Have you seen Kim? No. Meet me by the pool in a couple of minutes? Um, hmm. Cool. Thanks, honey. Where are you going? You're not planning on talking to her now, are you? I'm going to find Phil. I'm sure he won't want to miss Scarlett's speech. Gloria. Wait, wait, wait, Phil... Take one with the phone. [gunshot] [screams] Oh, my...! That party must have cost at least a hundred grand. How many people do you think there were tonight? I don't know. You okay? I'm fine. Do you want to talk about it? No. What made you run up to him like that? I don't know. What did he say? He said he still loved her. So much for love. What's this? I prepared your favorite. Wow! I see. How did you sleep? I passed out. How about you? I was thinking we should go to a marriage counselor. I made a list of a few that I liked so you can choose. What for? I think it'll help us communicate. We're communicate now, aren't we? I'm worried Phil, I don't want us to end up like Scarlett and Troy. You're not Scarlett and I'm definitely not Troy, so there's nothing for you to worry about. This is important to me. I'm late for a meeting at the course. We can talk about it later. Thanks for breakfast. hey guys. Did you have a great time at Grandma's Is it true there is a shooter at the party. Where did you hear that? Nicky saw it on facebook. Everyone is talking about it. they say he shot himself. Is true. Cool, did you get to see him blow his brain out? no it's not cool is actually very sad. Is actually Scarlett Ex. what why do he do it. Cos he is a psycho he's not. he wasn't a psycho he was just going through a very difficult time. A situation and a breakdown He should have shot Scarlett. Nicky! What Server the Lord with gladness. Come before him and joyfully sing. I will sing loving kindness and justice. Oh, thee Lord, I sing thee praises. I will give heed... I will give heed... [crying] Someone please tell Scarlet we can all see her grief from here. [classical music] It's fabulous! No! I will tell my client, but I can't make any promises. What are you doing? I'll call you back. We are here to have fun. That was Troy's lawyer. Are you sure you want to go through with this? Why not? You have his house, the business, if we go after the hidden assets he'll go to jail. As someone once said, frankly, I just don't give a damn. He started it, now let's finish it. And I thought I was ruthless. Gloria, Phil! It's true. If divorce was easier, I would have left him years ago. The only time Troy ever gave me an orgasm was when he signed the divorce papers. [all laughing] I'll be right back. Gloria: What were you two talking about? How are you two doing? What the hell are you doing? I have a surprise for you. Stop. -What's wrong? -Stop! I can't do this. Are you kidding me? What do you mean you can't do this? You know what I mean. I didn't have a choice. I was going to lose everything. But it's over now. We can be together. No. What do you mean, no? I'm not a teenager anymore. I'm not gonna play these games with you. What are you talking about? You're sick, Scarlett. One minute you want to jump me and the next you want to slit your wrists. I used to find it thrilling but now I realize it's just pathetic. I'm serious, leave me and my family alone. [door opens and closes] Give him the benefit of the doubt. Maybe he's planning a surprise for you. What are you two gossiping about? Nothing. Oh, you're talking about me then. I'm about to cut the cake. I prepared a speech. I'd like you to hear it. We'll be right there. Scarlett. Scarlett? Hey, what's up? Can we talk? Can it wait till later? I know about you and Phil. What are you talking about, honey? How could you do this? I'm your friend, I'm the only one who's stood by you through all your ups and downs. And God knows there's been a lot of them. I have no idea what this is about. You can play dumb blonde with anyone but me. I know you. There isn't a dumb calorie in your whole body. I just want to know when you started sleeping with him, again. Or if you just never stopped? I'm not sleeping with him! Come on, Scarlett! When you want something, you stop at nothing to get it. You know it's true. Gloria, stop. There's nothing between us. Please, just stop denying it. At least give me that much credit. He still wears the Baume Mercier watch that you gave him. It's a nice watch. How can you do this? You can have any man you want. Why my husband? If you take him, you'll destroy my entire life. If things aren't going well between the you two, find someone else to blame it on, because this time it's got no thing to do with me. I haven't slept at all since the party. Oh, sister, please. Oh, Gloria, Phil. Hey! Thank you so much for coming. You have no idea how hard this has been on me. I tried calling you a few times and you didn't answer my calls. I just wanted to make sure you are okay. Are you coming on Thursday? I don't think so. I'll call you later. What's up with her? I don't know. [phone ringing] Hello? Hi, is this Bradly's mom? Yes. I'm calling from the nurse's office at Highland Woods. Bradly is fine but we need you to pick him up. Is he okay? Okay. What happened? I don't want to talk about it, okay? Who hit you? It was nobody. If you don't tell me right now, I'm gonna start asking around. Okay, fine. It was Matt. What? I can't believe that! I'm going to call his mom right now. No! Mom. Please, It's over, we settled it. It was my fault. I hit him first. Why? Phil: Yes. I am working on it! No, I can't talk right now. No. Bradly: Can you guess it? Nicky: What do you think? [indistinct dialogue] What's this? Pizza party. I didn't have time to go to the market so I just ordered delivery. Want a slice? We have pepperoni. What happened to your nose? Matt beat him up at school. What? We talked about it. Have you talked to Matt's parents? No. Why not? Because Bradly hit him first. And you reward him with pizza? Matt was teasing him. -I don't care! -Sorry. You're sorry? If I would have done something like that my dad would have beat the crap out of me. Okay, you're over reacting. He let his emotions get the best of him, that's all. That's all? That's the point, Gloria. Do you know how this makes me look? Do you? -Go to your room. -I'm not done yet. [screaming] I said, go to your room, now! Phil. What are you doing? Do you understand that he was fighting because he was trying to defend you? I don't care. I really don't. He has to learn to be a man. And he's never going to do that if you keep treating him like a baby? He still pees the bed, for God's sake. Phil, what are you doing? Why are you acting like this? Like what? I'm fine. It's a little cold, right? I mean, it's still good, you know. I'll eat it. Hey there. What's wrong? You want something to eat? [doorbell] I do apologize for stopping by unannounced but you are not answering my phone calls. Where was this? The Rostropovich competition in Paris. Are you still playing? No, I gave my Cello to Nicky. How's she doing? She's fine. Did I do something to upset you? Why do you ask? Ever since my party you've been acting strange with me. Sorry. I just need some time to figure things out. Is this about Phil again? Why don't you just get rid of him? It's not that easy. I have kids to think about. You have to take care of yourself first. What happened to you? You used to be so confident, so cool. Monica, Kim, and I, we always wanted to be you, and now it's like you've given up on yourself, babe. What am I supposed to do? Just throw it all away? People make mistakes. Relationships have their ups and downs. Phil and I have been going through a rough patch since my dad died, but I know we can just get through it. That's another thing I've always admired that about you. What? How idiotically hopeful you are. I rather be hopeful, than cynical. Now, I have things to do. So, if you need anything else? Tomorrow is Thursday. I need space. Who's going to bring the wine? I'll give you a bottle if you need it. No, it's okay. Holler at me if you change your mind. Okay, we're meeting at five, as usual. -Bye. -Bye. This stuff's horrible. The guy at the store said it was the most expensive bottle. Gloria, is the only one of y'all who can pick out a decent bottle of red. I'm worried about her. Ever since the party she's been acting strange. Well, she did tell me at the party she discovered something on Phil's computer. You should put your investigator on Phil. If he's up to something we should help her catch him. If you hire an investigator, I'll tell him. You wouldn't bust a grape at a fruit fight. I don't have to listen to this. I'm leaving. No, I'm sorry. Relax. Sit down. I'm not gonna do anything. For now. Well, I'm going to fetch something to wash this awful taste out of my mouth. Do you gals want anything? -Um hmm. -I can go. No it's fine. I'll get it. [classical music] Hey, neighbor. How much do you think this circus cost? I don't know about the grand total, but this beluga fish caviar is ten grand a pound. It's so disgusting but you have to try it. How far we've come, you and I. Did you look into that thing I sent you? I can't do it. Come on. I'm just asking you to help me out. No, you're asking me for much more than that. You're asking me to betray my friend. And I'm giving you half a million reasons to do it. It's not about money. It's always about money. I saw it in your face, every morning when we had to take the bus to Saint Francis, past their big gorgeous houses. You know what they used to call us? -The Charity kids. -The Charity kids. How much longer do they get to remind us that without them, we'd be worthless? I looked into it. The money can only be used for your children after they turn 18. Yes, I know that, that's why I need you to help me change it. There has to be a way. There are always ways, but they would have to involve her. What do you mean involve her? How? The money can be invested in what's called an "orphan" company, and then through some maneuvering we can get around it. But Gloria is the sole manager. If she's not on board, you can't touch it. The whole point was to keep her out. I know. I'm sorry. What if we falsify her signature? How long do you think it would take her to figure it out and for both of us to end up in jail? There are better ways to handle this. Like what? [cell ringing] Hey neighbor, how's it going? Good. Look, I can't talk right now but I just wanted to give you a heads up. Scarlett was at your house yesterday chit chatting with Gloria. She knows that you're after her money so you have to be extra careful. Don't worry. I have it under control. Good. We'll talk later. Bye. So, I put some candies in your bags but they're for you to share with everyone, okay? Okay. I'm gonna miss you guys so much. Mom, you're embarrassing us. Sorry, sorry. Make sure you put on a lot of sunscreen and bug spray, okay? -Okay. -And Bradly, no hitting, okay? If someone teases you, you go to a counselor, okay? -No fighting. -Got it. Do you think you can come home early today? Why? I was just thinking, since we're alone, it'd be nice for us to hang out together. Yeah, I can probably do that. I have a lot of stuff I have to do first though. Okay, I love you. I love you, too. Honey! What are you... Are you okay? Jack: Gloria, what's going on? Jack, it's Lulu. I don't know what's wrong with her. I found her by the trash. She's not moving, and her tongue is sticking out. Is she breathing? Barely. She's panting. Did you see if she ate anything? Anything that could have made her sick? I don't know. I'm on my way there. Okay, bring her. [crash] Just do it. I'll call you back. What happened? How long was I out? Since yesterday. They had to operate on your leg. What about Lulu? Lulu's dead. I'm going to have her cremated. Do the kids know? No, I haven't told them anything yet. I don't want to ruin their vacation. I'd like to wait till they get back. Good idea. What happened? I was taking Lulu to the vet. I found her on the ground with her tongue sticking out and... [knocking at door] Doctor: Good morning. I'm Doctor Leibowitz. -Hey, Doc. -Hi. -How's she doing? -Let's take a look. How are you feeling? Not good. Do you have any pain? A little. I feel a little numb. Is that normal? You're still under the effects of the anesthesia. You know you're really lucky. You could've been paralyzed. When do you think we could take her home. Her urea and creatinine numbers came out a little high in the lab report. What's that? They're indicators of kidney function. Have you had kidney problems before? No. I don't think so. We'll need to conduct more tests to really understand what's going on. Right now? Is that really necessary? Can't we come back another day and have them? Why would you want to do that? I want to get her home. I think she'll recoup better there. I understand. I just want to make sure she's clearly on the road to recovery. Who will be looking after her at home? I will. Her mobility will be restricted for some time. Can you take care of that? Of course. Alright, I'll sign the discharge papers. But just know that I'm releasing you against medical advice. -Well, maybe... -We're fine. We know that. Let's get you home. Hope you like it. I'm not hungry. Babe, you have to eat. How are you feeling? How does it look like I'm feeling? You got presents. Monica sent you these snacks, Kim sent you this flower, and Scarlett sent these magazines so you wouldn't get bored. "Fifty ways to please your man in bed." Sounds interesting. Not really. Hey... I'm just worried about our insurance premiums. I'm sure they're going to skyrocket. And then there's the health insurance with the co-pays and the deductibles... I don't really know what else to say. I'm really sorry. I was... I was talking to Monica... about the trust. And I think we should look into using some of the money. No. Okay, I didn't want to have to tell you this... but the company is going through some financial difficulties right now and this money could really help. That money is for our kids future. It's ten million dollars? What are they going to do with ten million dollars? I'm sorry, but I'm not changing my mind. I see. Where are you going? I forgot your juice. I'm sorry that I've been a little rude lately. I'm just a little cranky. That's fine. I understand. I'm sure we can make some cuts in the budget and I'll sell some stuff if we have to, but I really don't want to touch my father's trust. I'm sure if your dad were still alive and he saw what we're going through he would change his mind. That would never happen. -How do you know? -Because I know. How? You know, maybe I was wrong. I always thought your Dad was the problem, but maybe it's you. Maybe it's you who doesn't want to help us. He thought you were a bum. A worthless bum. When I married you he said that we would never survive without him and I told him that we would never touch his money. So, when the kids are old enough to decide for themselves what they want to do with it, I'll tell them who he was and where the money came from, but until then I will not touch it. I have to go. Do you need me to call someone or will you be okay? I'll be fine. Okay. Call me if you need anything. Hey, it's done. [door opens and closes] [glass breaks] [startled gasp] What are you doing? I didn't want to wake you. I was just going to give you a kiss. How are you feeling? Not good. What's wrong? My leg hurts. Oh. Could you get me some pills from my purse. Sure. Let me go get you some more juice. No. Just water. Okay. I spilled the juice. I'm sorry. How was your day? [cell ringing] Work stuff. [cell ringing] I have to take this. Sorry. I can't talk right now. I know. I need a couple more days, that's it. Okay, we'll talk then, bye. Who was that? Nobody. Something from work. Why didn't you take it in here? I didn't want to bother you. I know you're seeing someone else. I don't know what you're talking about. You come home late from work every night, we never talk, you never want to sleep with me. Just tell me, who is it? Who is what? The person you're sleeping with. What are you talking about? You're being paranoid. I'm not an idiot, Phil. I know you. This is ridiculous. Is it one of my friends? If you're not happy in our relationship, then we should work it out. Just talk to me. There's nothing to talk about. Why can't you just admit it? I'm not talking about this. I'm not! Do you love her? Do you love her? Where are you going? Come back! You didn't have to sleep upstairs, you know. I'm sorry. Drink your juice. I really think we should see a therapist. Fine. We'll see whoever you want, but you heard what the doctor said, you need to drink your fluids to get better. Good. A little more. Stop! We need to talk. Why don't you love me anymore? Of course I do. Where are you going? To the gym. I'll shower there. I'm sorry. For what? I'm trying to make things better. What did I do that was so wrong that we can't even talk about it? Nothing. I'm not the kids from school who tortured you. I'm your wife. I love you. I know you do. Yes, I just got home and found my wife passed out on the floor. No! I don't know what happened to her. I got here and she was just on the floor. [classical music] Doctor: It's a miracle she's still alive. Her kidneys are severely damaged. Do you know why? We're still trying to figure that out. But in the meantime we're going to have to put her on dialysis twice a week. Here's a pamphlet with more information. She's gonna need lots of fluid and no drugs or alcohol. Thank you, doctor. So, I'll be back later. I left you some food in the fridge and look what came today. It's Lulu's ashes. I'll buy you a nice vase to put them in. Hey, neighbor. Don't "hey neighbor" me. You lied to me. First you said she was as good as dead and then you said she was on board and none of that is true. I'm sorry. Okay? Things they got a little more complicated than I anticipated but we can still figure it out. No, I already figured it out. We're going to renegotiate. -What do you mean? -I want half. Half? Half? If you think I am giving you five million dollars, you're crazy. I already started moving money around. I'm in too deep. I gotta start over somewhere else and that is the price you're gonna have to pay for it. You can't do this to me, Monica! We had a deal. If you don't like it, we can both go down, but I'm not giving up my entire life for a miserable 500k while you're living the big life in Buenos Aires. I have a better idea. How about, we start over together, huh? I found this house in the mountains... I'm sure you'll love it. You're barking up the wrong tree, neighbor. The only thing I care about is the money. The cash will be available in three weeks. Thanks! [Jack] Hi, Gloria. How can I help you today? Yes, I was just wondering if you had an idea of what may have caused Lulu's kidney failure? To have suffered such a severe reaction, she has to have ingested something really poisonous. It can be a whole bunch of stuff. Toxic plants, pesticides, antifreeze. I'm sorry. Did you say antifreeze? Yes, although it would have to be an old bottle or something that was specially ordered. Why? They put a special bitterant in it, like nail polish, so dogs won't be drawn to it. I see. You should take a look around, see what she could have eaten. I will. Thank you. No problem. I hope you feel better. Say hi to Phil for me. Oh. Thank you. Bye. [The Barber of Seville overture] [music continues] Honey, I'm home. Hey, honey, how are you feeling? [moans] You know, I really missed you today. I brought you more juice in case you get thirsty. [moans] Sleep tight, baby. You're up early. I'll stop by later to take you to your dialysis appointment. Don't worry about it. I'll go by myself. Are you sure? Yes. As you wish. Oh! Here. Thank you. [door opens and closes] [Overture continues] -Oh, Gloria. -Hi, Doctor. How are you feeling? I'm feeling great. How are you? Me? I'm amazed. Your numbers are great, your leg is much better, I don't know how you did it. You're almost as good as new. -Thank you. -What's your secret? I just needed some motivation. Gloria: Hey, Scarlett. Gloria! What a surprise. Are we still on for tonight? Are you... you're coming? Of course, it's Thursday isn't it? Well, yeah! I just wasn't sure if you were still my friend. Why not? Who knows? How are Phil and the kids? The kids are in camp until Saturday and Phil is working. Working? That's a new one. Are you gonna bring the wine? Of course. See you later then, honey. Gloria? Phil: Gloria, are you home? Oh! Hi, honey. I was just thinking about you. What are you doing here? What do you mean? You told me you were going to meet with the girls. Oh! Yes, I was just running a little behind. How did it go with the doctor? What did he say? He is saying that I'm doing much better. Isn't that great. -Yeah. It's great. -Yeah. Do you want me to get you something to drink? No, I'm going to take a shower actually. Okay. Phil: Did he figure out what the problem was? What? The doctor. Did he figure out why your kidneys were failing? No. He has no idea. Huh. I may be home a little late tonight. Maybe we can have supper then. Phil: Yeah, of course. I love you. [indistinct chatter] -Oh, my God! -Oh, my god! Are you okay? Are you hurt? The blood's not mine, It's Phil's. He's dead. -What? How? -What? I killed him. -What? -No. Can I come in? Can I take a shower? I need to rinse off. Come in! Yes, of course. Come on in. Oh, my god. Don't tell me you're going to drink that. It's wine isn't it? It also has blood on it. We have to call the police. We have to wait to see what happened first. You know what happened. She killed him! Gloria's no killer. If she canceled Phil's birth certificate she had a damn good reason for it. What? You're not going to say anything? What can I say? I'm still in shock. It won't make a difference if we call the police now or wait a few minutes. What if Phil isn't dead? What if he's bleeding out somewhere? What if we can still save him. Yeah, maybe we'll save him, but what about Gloria? And what about us? Aren't you worried about us? We can all go to jail too, you know. Come on, Monica, you're the lawyer here. Say something. I'm afraid Kim's right. No matter what Gloria says, we have to report her. If we don't, it's not only immoral, it's also illegal. I put on your dress. I hope you don't mind. No. Of course not. How are you holding up? I need to get rid of this. I think we need to talk first. We need to understand what happened. She'll talk when she's ready. Come on, honey, I know the prefect place. I'm with Monica. We want to know what happened. I killed him out of self-defense. How is that possible? He tried to murder me. Why? Why would he do that? -Well, ask Monica. -What? How should I know? You're a divorce lawyer. How else would Phil have control of my money, unless I'm dead? Yes, I guess that's right. Well, she told you want you wanted to know. I hope you're happy. He tried to poison me. And I confronted him and then he attacked me. And I had to shoot him. Are you sure he's dead? The bullet went through his right eye and out... the top of his head so yeah, I'm pretty sure. I'm sorry. I need to go to the bathroom. What are we going to do? I need your help. He didn't leave work until five thirty, I need you to say that I was here at five, like every Thursday. Gloria, the wife is always the prime suspect. They'll interrogate you, they'll find inconsistencies in your story, they'll look for gun residue on your hands, this is what they do for a living. I'm begging you. Please! Please back me up on this. I had no choice. It was either him or me. You have to turn yourself in. I'll help you, we'll plead self-defense, temporary insanity, whatever, but you don't want the police digging into your business. -Trust me. -I can't. We'll take care of the kids. They'll understand. Right? I can't turn myself in. Now if you want to do it, I can't stop you. I just don't understand why he'd want to kill you. I think he wanted to take my money and leave with someone. With who? One of you. One of us? Are you crazy? We're your friends. Are you? What are you saying? I'm gonna go check on Kim. Make sure she's okay. Listen to me. You're wrong about Scarlett. I'm her lawyer, I know everything about her, and I can guarantee you she wasn't screwing Phil. I know that. Well, I know you don't think I was. I don't. [classical music] What are you doing here? I needed to see you. You're crazy. You gotta go. No. If you don't leave, I will. [classical music continues] Stay away from me. What' s the matter? People can see us, you know. Who cares? Let them see. You told me you'd divorce her. We would go away together. It's not that simple. I can lose everything. Then go back to Gloria. Wait. I'm working on a plan. Hey. I just need time. I already talked to Monica. What? You told Monica about us? No, relax, I didn't tell her about us. I just told her I wanted to leave Gloria. -She doesn't know the details. -Damn it, Phil. I mean, you couldn't find another lawyer? Not better than her. Besides, this way Gloria can't hire her. Two birds, one stone. You are one cold hearted son of a bitch, you know that? I'm not the one sleeping with my friend's husband. So what's the plan? I'm working on getting some money together so we can start a life. Gloria's money. Who cares? It'll be ours soon enough. I don't believe you. You're just trying to gain time so I'll be your mistress forever. You gotta make a choice, me or her. I've already decided. One month. That's all I need. But how? The flight leaves on a Thursday at midnight. So you go to your little regular girls get together, and while you're there, I'll go to my house, I'll pack up my things, the kids will be at camp so... there won't be a problem. As soon as you're done gossiping, you'll drive to the airport and meet me. Gloria: Phil? Gloria: Phil? Soon, baby. Soon. Scarlett: Kim. Kim, are you okay? Kim? What are you doing? I'm gonna stab that bitch. What are you talking about? She's lying, can't you see? She figured out that he's leaving her and she murdered him. She did all of this on purpose, she's punishing us. Put the knife down. For god's sake you're scaring me. I'm going to stab that bitch in the heart. Stop it! Put down the knife down! I don't need another dead body in my house. What's the game plan, huh? I don't know. It's over. Let it go. Good. -What are you doing? -I'm calling the cops. -No, you're not. -You can't stop me. Hello, I'd like to report a... Stop! Phil was not the man that you thought he was. And you're not the first person he's screwed around with. We weren't screwing around. No? He's slept with everyone. You're wrong. What? Are you going to tell me you two were in love? That man didn't even love his mama. He didn't care if he hurt you. He didn't care if he lived or died. The only thing that man cared about was himself. Oh, keep going. I want to hear it too. I saw you two at the party. I was looking for Phil and I saw you behind the tree. I called out his name. It's not Kim's fault. Of course not. It's all of you. Because any of you could have stopped it but you didn't. You can't blame all of us for your problems. Of course I can. Because you are all heartless little people who think that money, and power, and beauty are all that matter. You know, Gloria, I am so sorry we cannot be all as good as you. Oh, I'm sorry I ruined your trip to Buenos Aires. Scarlett: No! Stop! Stop! No! Gloria! What are you doing? -Gloria! -Oh, my god! Stop! [all screaming] [gunshots] Oh, my god! Hand me a towel! We need to stop the bleeding. Kim! Oh, Kim! Don't just stand there, call an ambulance! Hold on. Hold on, okay? We're calling for help now, okay? Someone has been shot at my house. We need an ambulance! Thank you. They're on their way. I think she's dead. You must be real proud of yourself. Getting rid of your husband and his mistress in just one night. The night's not over yet. What are you going to do? Kill us all? Should I? How do you know I won't tell them everything? Just one word from Scarlett and me and you're done. Maybe you should. But then you'd lose that suitcase full of cash that you have hidden in the trunk of your car. And that's when Kim lunged at her with the knife and Gloria pulled out the gun. Can I get you anything, Detective Brown? No, thank you. Why did Kim attack Gloria? I'm just not sure. How about something to eat? I have some cheese and crackers in the kitchen. Thank you, Scarlett, but I really need to get done with this interview. Of course. Detective Brown: I just need you to explain what you mean when you say you're not sure why Kim attacked Gloria? Did she all of a sudden just pull a knife on her with no reason? Gloria said something about a trip and Kim just snapped. Maybe Gloria or Monica can be more helpful, but that's all I've got. Does Gloria always carry a gun? I don't know. Is the Chief treating you well? The Chief treats me fine ma'am. We're good friends, the Chief and I. I hosted the fund raising dinner for his campaign last year. Yeah, yeah, I know. Is there anything else that.. you can tell me? Anything else that might help explain what happened here tonight? You know, your son looks just like you. You know my son, too? Yeah, he works at the pharmacy I go to. They're ready for you. Don't you dare say a word. Can you please walk me through the night. What happened? Oh, we met here like we do every Thursday. We had some wine, talked... Talked about what? You know, nothing important, just gossip. How about Gloria. Did she talk about anything? Monica: I don't remember. Detective Brown: You're a lawyer, correct? Monica: Yes, that's correct. You know what will happen if you lie to me. Yes, I am aware of the consequences. Why did Kim attack Gloria with a knife? I suppose Gloria gave her some upsetting news. Suppose? I don't know the details, Detective. Do you think Gloria acted in self-defense when she shot Kim? Monica: Yes. Okay. Whoa. Are you alright? Ah, yes. I'm fine. Where do you live? Cherokee Hills. That's quite a drive from here. Are you sure you can make it? Yes, I'm sure. Let's go. Where to? I need to take you down to the station for some more questions. I don't think that's really necessary is it, Detective? It's been a long night and Gloria is not going anywhere. I'm sure she can give you everything you need tomorrow after she's had some rest. I'm just doing my job, ma'am. And we appreciate that, but I think you got what you need. Scarlett... Please don't make me contact the Chief at this hour about those Oxy prescriptions your son's been peddling. Un-cuff her. You're free to go, but don't leave town before the investigation is over. Do you understand? I understand. [detective on phone] Detective. Yes? I have something to tell you. What is it? You want to tell me something? Um... I must have forgotten. Call me if you remember. Here's my card. Give me a call anytime. -You drive home safe. -Yeah. I just got off the phone with the Chief, everything is fine. -Okay. -What now? I don't know. Start over I suppose. Why don't you just stay here. I have plenty of space. No. I want to go home. What about Phil's body? I'll figure something out. You know, you never told us how he tried to kill you. He was putting antifreeze in my drink. Goodnight. Thanks. [cell phone ringing] Hello? Monica, it's me. How much wine did you have tonight? I don't know. A lot. Why? Pull over. What's wrong? It's poisoned. Pull over! I'd like to report an attempted murder. My husband. He tried poisoning me. He's boarding a flight to Buenos Aires tonight. Yes. [The Barber of Seville overture] Oh, my god! [overture continues] FBI agent: Phillip Clark. FBI. Come with us, sir. [overture continues] Oh, if it weren't for these three women and our sacred Thursday afternoon get-togethers, I can assure you, I would not be here today. So, Monica... Kim... and Gloria... Please join me on stage as we raise our glasses together. Phil, take one with the phone. [overture continues] No! Hang on! Hang on! [overture continues] Troy: I love that bitch. Gloria: Troy, just give me the gun. Scarlett: No! Don't! [gunshot] [overture ends] [applause]
