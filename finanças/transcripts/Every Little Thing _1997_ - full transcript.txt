Ever since I first came to La Borde in 1969 to 1971 What plays have you been in? Ah, all kinds I was in a play by Mollère in a play by Mollère called "Le Bourgeois gentilhomme" And also, I think, "L'Ecole des femmes" I was in Ah, the play I liked a lot was one by Fujima - Does that exist? - Yes it was "The Silk Drum" Ah, we had a good time on that one! I killed myself and came back as a ghost They're going to they'll be We'll need chairs, some can sit down, others can dance come over to chat, wander around The valets can hand out snacks or something like that We need movement The music has to be there virtually all the time either in the background or up front - But the second act has to be - Music and noise - And the wind and all that - Music and effects Is anybody here? A lamp Who? A lamp The prince? For the love of God! Be careful! What a wind! It's the wind of history! - Where is everybody? - Scattered, lost... What happened? An earthquake? Who can tell? Something happened but who can tell what? - And the princess? - Here Don't you recognise her? The table, that's her What happened? The revolution! Tear their legs off! - What's that? - I've no idea! - Where are they rushing to? - Straight ahead! Bizarre forms, demented shapes... I don't know, I don't understand, I don't comprehend Motionless, dazed, confused... Oh, dear me, poor Flor! Poor Flor! Poor Flor! Tell me, have you lost the use of words? When human affairs... ...can't be crammed into words... ...language explodes! I can't take anymore - Are you filming, Nicolas? - Yes All right!

That poor nurse is crazy The staff need care! Sometimes, you know! We're not against the idea! Patients are the ones who need care True, if we get care, no one will look after you! Want a light? Don't you want a real cigarette instead of that old stub! - You play the Piano, don't you? - Oh no! I've never played any instrument Well, you press here Try a white one instead - I'm pressing both - Leave your fingers on them But I'm pressing two at once! Your fingers are too thick it's getting better Those are low notes, and those high ones? - Is that it? - Yes Like a Piano - high notes and low notes I've never touched one of these - You sang that, right? - That's it! Go on, play! Play the verse or the chorus! I'm not keen on that one Is that on or not? Are you shooting this? No! You're just getting used to holding the camera! You won't fool me, you know it's not making a noise! Lovely! Thank you, gentlemen This is wonderful! Switchboard Who-who's calling? Who are you, please? Who are you? Séverine? I may need a half-hour to find her Will a half-hour be all right? You don't understand? In a half-hour half an hour You call back Call back, that means calling a second time Will that be OK?

It's a very beautiful parasol Now then, go back to the curls Curls are being worn down over the forehead this year... ...with one long ring over the ear. Have you noticed, Tinette? Excuse me, I don't think the father's that interested He's probably not that attentive! Oh, no! - Well, then - After?

Want to go over that again? - I just have to learn it by heart - Me too - You already know it - I don't Yes, you do it's just because you haven't got the text today it's up to you, we go over it again or All right Take your props back it's very pretty Do you like the play? Yes, especially the third act Why? Because the castle is in ruins the wind blows there are all kinds of sound effects The lines are totally illogical That comforts me Black is black I've lost all hope You know, this is an instrument that makes a lot of noise it does? It's very sharp, it makes a lot of sound The "chiks" will drown out the other instruments so try not to bang it too hard, see Just play calmly, we'll hear it loud enough - OK? - One more time? Just use your left hand, so we're all together Right, one, two, three, boom Start with "boom" it always starts with "boom" Get it together, Philippe You're doing it the other way round you're doing One bang on the bottom, and two on the top That's it! Do I have to play in the intro? Ah, I didn't play the intro I'll play it so we'll all be set You start up just after That's good Lah diminuendo Me Move on to the chorus Why don't you think you can? No! Let go I mustn't take the first step with my left leg Stop, let go Right, go on! Straighten up! Lean on your arms Not like that! What the hell are you doing, Hervé? There, slowly, slowly, take it easy Parsley, parsley A glass of iced vodka with the starter? You don't really feel like touching your hair after The smell it's a bit strong We need that parsley, Dédé! There! A little bit to one side And you do all these little things it's very pretty it's a bit like a TV show There! A tasty dish full of colour and economical with it A dish for big families and it looks all the same Daniel! Get to work, Daniel! Oh, you've finished! I'd like to film things I'm doing my best I pull faces I can't help it it's not my fault I pull faces He's here They're taking everything! They're taking me completely What's going to be left? What'll be left for me? Thanks a lot Dirty old man - He prickles! - True, he does prickle Old King Dagobert Dragged his trousers in the dirt... Take everything off - The trousers too! - No! I'm kidding They were fine as they were This won't do any good Ah, like that, yes There's nothing to straighten them? That's why Welcome reunion, July 28, 1995 Can everyone hear? Right! First point, the letter to the families invitations for August 15 I have to read this letter, do I? Was it written by the Club's secretary? La Borde, July 21 Dear friends, this is a short missive ...with news of the Club's activities since the beginning of the year As we told you in our January letter... We certainly don't write much! ...we had many projects We have organized skiing trips... ...exchange days with other clubs. ...for instance, the Bretonneau Hospital in Tours.. ...an inter-clinics day in June... ...visits to exhibitions, for instance, Brancusi... - Can you hear? - Yes, Doctor To develop our work, your financial support... Here it comes As each year, we're happy to invite you... ...to a theatrical performance, of Witold Gombrowicz's "Operetta..." ...on Tuesday, August 15 at 5:00pm We shall also be organizing a bring-and-buy sale Do not hesitate to send us any old clothes, trinkets or books... ...that clutter your cupboards... that's not so sure All proceeds will go to the club With best wishes, the Club secretary - Has this been sent out? - It has been sent - How long ago? - A week ago now - Any replies yet? - A few Really? Any results? We've had one Exchequer Five letters and one cheque One cheque in a week isn't bad! And we've had things to sell - Really? - Yes, for the bring-and-buy You know there's a show on? Near the pottery workshop - Ought to go! - You ought to go? Would you like to be in it? There's a workshop, there's a thing This is for a play Would you like to be on stage? Can I have my hand back, please? - Would you like that? Just once - To see Doctor Oury? No, to be on stage and be in a play - What stage? - On the theatre stage Haven't you seen where we're going to perform? - I'll show you - There's a corkscrew there Shall we go? It'll be a nice walk This is what I suggest I play the intro, then you stand up and sing And when you're standing you throw yourselves into it Ah! What a ball this is! Ah ah ah ah, what a ball this is! Ah ah ah ah, it's quite a ball! Good! So everyone sings - And you, Jacques - it says "oh oh oh!" Yes, it says "oh oh oh", but I prefer "ah ah" OK? Something like that? What about me? Not right now! Later, Guy, we'll sing Shall we try that? Right, everybody And then the banker and the marchioness - Can you do the marchioness? - And the general too I'd like that Can you do both of them? Right, all together Sorry, I got that wrong it should be We'll do it without the accordion otherwise we can't hear With all the other guests now Let's do the two Banker! - Not quite, but you're almost there - Almost where? Volume-wise it has to be louder it won't be easy - Let's try - Try it again Put in three "voul voui voui" Four "you you you you" and four "ah ah ah ah" We'll note all that Try learning it, instead of reading it Rehearse it so that you know it by heart He's adding a "voui" and then he's addling a "you" That's three "yous"? That makes four "yous" and three vouis" - And two "djaouls"? - He's keeping those, I think Yes! It's like that - He's addling a "voui" - All right He's addling a "you"? All right! - One more time, Jacques? - Yes All right, with everyone coming in - That's good! - It's OK And - Oh, please, Maurice... The princess, that's you Oh please, Maurice, I beg you so As silly as it seems, I'm dying to know Who could be hidden inside those sacks? Oh, Maurice, I'd love to take a peek! You'd better not peek inside I advise you, my dear, to be discreet! The stools of Lord Blotton The problem is that this isn't a reproach but if you came more often, the group would help you more You're a little out of it and you're alone with your doubts Otherwise, everyone would share them Come more often, even if you only pop in or come back several times an afternoon This is the final stretch I think it's worth it For today, tomorrow? - Tomorrow, yes - Tomorrow Try to come more regularly I think it can help your fear because many things it's complicated! Each time you say Take the plunge! Aulde, can you start it off? With a bit of spit We'll lick them up slick! With a lick of the tongue! With a lick of the tongue! Ha, ha, guys! Put some life into it! Hard with your mouth full? - Give me that Madeline! - He's got loads of them Shall we Wait for you? The stools of Lord Blotton! No! That's there, just above The stools of Lord Blotton! Stubborn, aren't you? Here - With a bit of spit... The stools of Lord Blotton! Right! Let's try There are two notes Great! Now this is different Oh, Flor! Oh, Flor! Great! There! Now this All this has been cut, this too So it's this Yes Thanks, André What was that you were singing, Michel? - Jacques, you have to sing it too - I don't know We've rewritten it it's on page 30 Want me to rewrite it for you? Yes, please! Because some things aren't aren't the same Right, we're cutting this Is that in? Yes, is that Flor? Yes, this is instead of that - We sing this instead? - Right instead of that Sorry in two syllables Then we go on to That makes a fair few lines - it's in with the group - A nice bit of music Yes, but it's fairly hard to sing You have to know how to start in time Starting is the hardest part Right, Mr Delannoy? Because you start it just after the beat if I count Then this won't be sung Oh, Flor! Oh Flor! That'll be spoken Here, we'll have the intro while you say Oh Flor! Oh Flor! I'll put "intro" to get you started properly Yes, it's me, Flor... Want some coffee? More More Want me to read it out? Apart from a few showers, the weather was good in Brittany Here we are back in the hubbub of La Borde There's no sea here, but the welcome is warm anyway it's nice to go away but coming back isn't bad either - Want to sign it? - Yes Try to find some room - How's the drawing going? - Not too good - I move too much! - She moves too much, huh? No, like that! And back! To one side, I mean! To one side Lower! Lower your head! The other side! And a bit like that! Like when I was writing? There, like that, that's it!

Stop it I'm drawing You're confusing me You'll make me do it wrong Stop it Leave me alone! Stop it, stop it! Nothing but the sound of the pencil and the eraser Has she got features there? I must be difficult to draw because I've got fairly difficult features They look like mumps features I've got high cheekbones That's what I call mumps features My eyes are very sunken, they're hard to draw What features? Mumps? Mumps features because of her mouth when she smiles like that Is it in black and white or colour? - Colour - Ah Is it nice?

There's a chill in the air Warm Christmas, icy Easter Never cast a clout till May is out But the sun isn't really... ...well, not very... She interrupts me, then I say The sun's not up to much! I forget what comes next No, a proverb it'll look bad I'll check The sun's not up to much... The calm after the storm... Look, mother, see that fellow there? She answers, in the tail coat? And I say Damn me, it's Agénor! She says her piece about how handsome Agénor is and I reply in the tail coat Back from a card game, not from church! Now I've had the honor of being introduced to you... ...may I rest for a moment... beside you on this bench... ...at a respectable distance A most respectable distance! Oh, please do! Your Grace is so kind! What happened? Did I sleep? I was dreaming about something as if I had a hand... Oh, yes, it was a dream As if a hand was... like this! A hand... A hand? What is on your Grace's mind? I promise! I promise! What is on your Grace's mind? What does your Grace want? Why are you sitting next to a girl like me? With your permission, mademoiselle... ...I suggest the idea... ...of a casual flirt... a flirt á la papillon? Women, ah, women! They're like a good lamb stew with Belmonta sauce! One shouldn't consume to excess Hard to digest Ladislas, how many have I bagged? 257, your Grace, and 256 for Baron Firulet! Flatulence, heartburn, statistics and migraines The law of great numbers! But since we're sitting here... ...let me invite you... ...let me invite you to Maxim's I only like women stuffed with food from the best restaurants Oysters with scampi... ...ostrich eggs cardinal, bouquet of salmon... ...stewed snipe... Subdued lighting, scarlet lampshade... Oh, I don't know your perfume... wait, wait Your perfume inflames my senses... To gallop, gallop, gallop! To gallop's my only passion! No saunter trot or canter For I gallop! At a gallop I race, My whip sets the pace! To gallop's my sport The gallop's my forte! To gallop I try, until I die! We've got to get this right! My only passion? My only pas-sion? - Good! - Not quite yet Try it on your own this time My only passion! In one ear and out the other Try to respect the tempo! Don't gallop ahead too fast Keep it steady or I won't be able to follow - That's it - That's good Are you OK, Philippe? Do you feel ready? - For what? - Well, for the performance? It's hard, because it's very hard, because I don't really know when to come in what rhythm to use how to hold my instrument and above all how to communicate with the whole of the audience that will be listening to the music There, that makes quite a number of how can I put it, requirements to deal with to be able to do something just about right So I tell myself that I'll try and do it during the fête I hope I'll manage it But that's just a hope I'll follow my leader my musical leader, if he still wants me to play on that particular day The day of the fête at La Borde Albertinette am I! A peach of a thing am I! I dance like a dream and play like a dream I've a sweet little mouth and teeth She's a sweet little mouth and teeth Albertinette's such a peach! Albertinette am I!

Suits him, doesn't it? With his flip-flops on his feet, it looks great! Did you draw the programme cover, Sophie? - Good, isn't it? - Very beautiful Who was it who had that idea? Marc Ledoux, I think He told you to draw a musician, a flautist? No, a man with a walking stick With a walking stick? That's not a man with a walking stick it looks more like a musician She said, "I'll draw what I want" She chose I told her about the play and she chose a model it was a jazz musician You introduced him to me Beautiful, isn't it? But you made your own choice You said, "That, no" "That, no That, yes!" And then, she did her job She did her job as usual She went to get her materials Tell us, Sophie You went to get the materials from your room? Your pencils What are they called?

You never watched your mother putting her make-up on for hours Mine made all kinds of faces I used to watch We're on schedule for the moment, it's perfect! Who's missing, who isn't in costume yet?
