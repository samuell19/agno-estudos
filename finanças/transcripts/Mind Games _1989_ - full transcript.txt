(birds chirping) (bicycle clattering) (newspaper thuds) (gentle music) - Here. - okay, I got it. (Kevin laughs) (bright music) (Kevin laughs) (children playing) - Kevin, be back by six. - Yeah. - Watch, honey. - Yes, ma'am. (birds chirping) (upbeat flute music) (water flowing) - Well, come on over. I'll teach ya to play. - (sighs) Dana, supper's about ready, could you get Kevin, please? (children chattering) - Dad! Dad, it was so neat, I found this great trail and this guy, he started teaching me how to play the flute. - I thought I told you not to go running off. - Mom said to be back by six. It's only a little past. - Come on, supper's ready, let's-- - Excuse me, it was my fault. We got to talking. (bright guitar music) - Thanks. You learning how to play the flute? - Um, yes, sir. - Your boy's a natural. You oughta save up for one, Kev. - I'm Dana Lund. - Eric Garrison, please to know you, Dana. - You should hear this guy play. He's great. He can play the guitar, the harmonica, the banjo. - You make it sound like I'm an expert, Kev. (chuckles) I just fool around. It's one of my hobbies. - Uh, can we invite him to dinner? - It's not polite to whisper. (chuckles) You eaten yet? - I polished off about 30 pounds of bread and cheese for lunch. (Kevin laughs) - we got plenty. Join us. - You sure? - Yeah. - Yeah, well what about Mom? - Ah, look, she'll be happy to have some new faces to look at aside from ours. - [Kevin] Play something. - [Eric] Haven't you had enough? - [Kevin] oh, come on, please? (children chattering) (upbeat flute music) - Eric, please, go ahead and start. - Thank you. - Do you parents mind you backpacking? - They worry. My mother expects me to be picked up by spaced-out weirdos, like the Manson Family, and cut up into little itsy-bitsy pieces. (chuckles) (Kevin and Eric chuckle) So far I've disappointed her. I'm only joking. - (clears throat) You going to college? - Yeah, I'm studying for my master's. - Dana's working on his B.A. in business administration. - It's night school. Slow going. - Sure, what line of work are you in? - Ah, supervised computer maintenance, cal state, Northridge. What are you taking? - You promise not to tell? - [Kevin] Mm-hmm. - Psychology. Abnormal psychology. You're not impressed? - [Kevin] sure. (chuckles) (laughs) (upbeat flute music) (crickets chirping) - [Rita] oh, no. - Park Place, that's three hotels. You rent is, ah-- - whatever it is, I can't pay it. I have no money. - [Kevin] Huh, sorry, Mom, but you're out. - Mm, I am afraid so. (upbeat pop music) Anyone want some coffee? - Yeah, I'd love a cup, thanks. - [Rita] Eric, would you like some? - Yes, thank you, Rita. I have a little work to do later on. - [Rita] Kevin, how about some hot chocolate? - Yes, please. What kind of work? - oh. - Is it something really gross? - Kevin! - It's okay, Rita. He has a right to be curious. I mean, what kind of work can a person do in the sticks in the dead of the night? (chuckles) - We're heading up over to Lompoc-surf tomorrow. Um, then we're heading up Highway one, if you wanna come along, you're welcome to. - Please, Eric, can you? - Thank you. But I thought I'd hang around here for a couple more days. - Oh, you still haven't said what you're gonna do later on tonight. (muffled whispering) Really? Oh, wow! (chuckles) (dice clatters) (mysterious music) (owl hoots) (crickets chirp) - Why'd you ask him to ride with us? - He seems like a decent enough guy. And he's harmless. - You could have asked me. - Oh, come on, honey. - (sighs) stop pawing me. (sighs) - [Kevin] It's Eric! Dad, stop, it's Eric! - I wish you wouldn't. (horn beeps) - It's beautiful, isn't it? - Yeah. (seagulls squawk) (waves crashing) - [Dana] Yeah, woo! - [Kevin] No! - Kevin, come here! - No, wait, no, no! - Come on, catch him! - No! (men laughing) - You coming in? - It looks cold. - Not once you're in. Take off your glasses. - Why? - Please. I like to see a person's eyes when I'm talking to them. Besides, you have nice eyes. - (scoffs) I'm an old married woman, Eric. - You're not old. You're young enough for anything. - Meaning sex? (Eric and Dana laughing) - Actually, that wasn't what I was thinking. - Oh, well what where you thinking, Eric? - I was thinking you're young enough to be happy. If you wanted to be. - I am happy. - You remind me of my girl. Before she leff me. (somber music) One knot tied inside of another. - She left you? - Took my kid with her. He'd be about three now. And you're not happy. Want me to split? - Dana and Kevin like you. Maybe you'll make things easier for us, I don't know. - You be sure and let me know, okay? - Okay. - [Kevin] Eric, come on! Come on, Eric. - come on! (Eric laughs) - Eric. Dana's very trusting. I'm not. - I know. You didn't like san simeon, did you? - No, as a matter of fact, I didn't. What about you? - Actually, it's, uh, what I'd expect my parents to build. (laughs) If they had any taste. - Oh, what's your father do? - He's a dentist in washington D.c. Fills the teeth of the embassy row set. General's alcoholic wives. Fawning lobbyists. Cadaverous congressman. You know, the backbone of American democracy. - You don't have a very high opinion of our government, do you? - It has nothing to do with the government. It has to do with people, and people are weak. - What do you mean, weak? - Take my parents, for example. They carved out their niche in Georgetown society. Sent me off to boarding school. Packed my grandmother off to the dog kennel for old folks. (sighs) - You know, speaking of san simeon, the thing that I don't understand is how a person with that much money doesn't use it to help somebody. - Oh, but he did. - Who? - Himself. (laughing) (bright guitar music) - Yeah. (Eric whistling) - Eric's back! (laughs) - We have arrival. You don't mind? - (chuckles) He can't stay a little boy forever. - Hey. (laughs) (Kevin laughs) Woo! - Yeah! - Does it really matter to you? - Of course it does. I'm tired of you insinuating that I don't love him. (Kevin and Eric laugh) - Come on. (door clacks) Hi. I hope I'm not late. - Potluck, anyway. Kevin, wash up. (Kevin and Eric laugh) - Where you been? - Looking for a place to bed down tonight. I found one. - You taking me there? - Kevin, watch what you're doing. (Eric chuckles) - [Kevin] sorry, Mom. - Here, let me get it. Your mom's just trying real hard to get supper ready, so settle down, okay? - I said I was sorry. - So, uh, can we sit down now, honey? - Oh, yes. - Hey, you couldn't get back before dark anyway, Kev. - Ah. - Yeah, besides, it's cold out there. - I've got a sleeping bag. A new one. Dad, please, can't I camp out with Eric tonight? Please? - No. - Ah, Mom. - I don't like the people around here. - Oh, they look okay. They're just out traveling like us. - It's not exactly wood smoke I got a whiff of a few minutes ago. - A little grass isn't gonna turn this place into sodom and Gomorrah. Or even the san Fernando valley. - Please, Mom? Nothing's going to happen to me. Eric'll be there. - Yeah, the whole time. He won't get into anymore trouble than I will. - Kevin, listen, I mean, you've never camped out, and all sorts of strange noises and stuff, and it might be scary for you. - We were going to camp out. That's why you bought me the sleeping bag. - That was for the desert. It's chilly and damp out here at night. You'll catch a cold and be sick for the rest of the trip. - No, I won't. - Well if you do, don't blame us. - I can go? - Finish your supper first. Hey, easy, easy, don't gobble. - You will watch after him. - Of course. (crows squawk) Going too fast for ya? - [Kevin] No. - It's not much further. I wanted to find just the right place. - [Kevin] I'm okay, honest. - Okay. (gentle music) Say, Kev, when you leave here, where are you and your folks headed? On up the coast? - Yeah, after Big sur, carmel, san Francisco, then Fort Ross. - Sounds like fun. - Yeah, can you come with us? - We'll see, where else? - [Kevin] Nevada, that will be the best place. - Why? - My dad's gonna take me to a real western ghost town. Nobody ever goes there. - Why not? - It's sort of isolated, I guess. - Want me to play something? - Yeah. (Eric laughs) (upbeat flute music) (dramatic music) (sighs) (door clacks) - Hi, honey. Is there any coffee leff? Hon. - I'm going to sleep alone from now on. Kevin can stay with me in the back bedroom and you can stay out here. That's the only way I'm gonna continue this trip. - What the hell brought this on? - Dana, let's not argue, okay? (sighs) - Listen, I thought we had a deal. You know? I thought we were gonna try to make it work. I mean, at least until the end of the trip. I thought we were gonna try, you promised. - I can't! - [Dana] why can't you? - Don't turn away from me. - Oh, okay. - Look, let's just have it out in the open, okay? - Okay. - Dana, we've grown apart. People don't stay the same all their lives, they change. I've changed. For the last nine years, I have hung on, hoping-- - I know, Rita. The thing-- - Let me finish! - Okay, okay. - I could be one of the top designers in L.A. if I had a chance. But I can't go to work and do a great job and then come home and be a housewife. You're strangling me, you're smothering me to death and you can't even see it. Dana, I've grown up. But you're still the same methodical little boy that thinks respectability and happiness is a tract house and a degree from a second rate college. - oh, don't mock my life. Okay? - Goddammit, listen to what I'm saying! - I'm listening to what you're saying, but don't you dare mock my life! If you wanna go to L.A. and play with your designer friends, you do it. You won't have to worry about them touching you. But don't you dare mock my life. I'm sorry. - There's something else. I wanna get rid of that hitchhiker. - Come on, no. - why not? - Because Kevin likes him. Because I like, because I say so! And you got nothing to say about it! - Well then you can take Kevin and me to the bus station first thing in the morning. - And you can hitchhike down there bare ass for all I care, but Kevin goes with me! - He's my son too, and you know I won't leave him! (door slams) (footsteps pattering) (dramatic music) (sighs) (crickets chirping) (ominous music) - You'll be okay for a while? - Where are you going? - Have some fun. And you watch things here and I'll be back in, oh, an hour or so. - [Kevin] well can't I come? - You'd be frightened. - Well what are you going to do? - I told you, have some fun. But it's not the usual kind of fun. If something went wrong, you might tell your parents I got you into trouble. - No way, man. I'm no snitch. - I didn't say you'd snitch on me. It's just, you'd have to do everything I say, and you might not like that. This is different from anything you've ever done before. (chuckles) It might cause you to have nightmares and wet your bed. - You're just like my dad. You think I'm just a kid and I don't know what's going on. - What's going on, Kev? - I've smoked grass. - How about pills? (ominous music) Pills are stupid. And what I have mind isn't stupid. - Let me come, please? - You'd have to do everything I say. And not ask questions, understand? If anything went wrong, it was your fault, you wanted to come along. Nah, forget it. I can't take a chance with a little kid along. - I'm not a little kid! I'm 1 0 and a half. - 1 0 and a half. Come on. (owl hoots) (ominous music) Come on. - Eric, what about the dog? (dog whines) - [Eric] Nice dog. (dog whines) (suspenseful music) - Eric, the people! - shut the door. They're gone. - How do you know? - I don't. - [Kevin] oh, gosh. (pounding on door) - Open up in there! You are all under arrest! This is the Gestapo! - Will they come back? - Sure. - when? - How the hell do I know? Don't ask anymore questions. (door bangs) (dog barks) Shut up, you ole mutt. Come in. (suspenseful music) I told you to do as I say. Come in. (knives scrape) (glass shattering) (dramatic music) (glass shattering) (objects clattering) (glass shattering) (objects clattering) (knife thuds in table) (objects clattering) (dishes shattering) (glass shattering) (dishes shattering) (vase shatters) - Eric! Eric! Why are you doing this? - No questions. (glass shatters) Come on. Let's go, partner. (dog barks) Cut up the sofa and the chair. I want the stuffings out of 'em. (objects clattering) Lots of work to do, Kev. We can't stay too long. If we don't work fast, we'll have to stay longer. And they might come back too soon. Vandals get long sentences in jail, Kevin. They even send little boys off to reform school. They beat them. And the other boys do dirty things to them. We haven't much time. I'll leave you. (glass shatters) I can hitchhike away. You'll never see that ghost town in Nevada. That lovely ghost town you waited to see for months and months (fabric tearing) And months. (dramatic music) (fabric tearing) (laughs) That's good, Kev, that's good. (laughs) (glass shattering) Yeah! (objects clattering) (glass shattering) Uh-huh, good, Kevin! Yeah! Come on, yes! (glass shattering) (furniture snapping) (objects clacking) (ominous music) Let's go! Out the back! (dog barks) (pot shatters) - Eric, stop! (dog barks and growls) (pole clanks) It didn't hurt us before, it shouldn't. (pole thuds against dog) (dog yelps) - Come on, I had to, he was gonna attack us. Come on, turbocharge it, Kev. - [Woman] oh, honey! Oh, my God, oh, no! (cries) (dramatic music) (branches snapping) (Eric panting) - Yahoo! (breathing heavily) Okay, okay. (sighs) Hit the sack. We've gotta get up early in the morning, Kev. - We can't stay here. - Why not? - Shit man, they're gonna come looking for us. - Hey, shh. Piss on it. Now, strip down, you'll burn up in your clothes in your bag. - I'm going back to the camper. It's cold here. - Hey, you won't be cold once you get in your bag, okay? (ominous music) What, do you need me to help ya? Come on. - I can do it! - Then do it. Woo, I'm in. (branch snaps) Uh, it's just a tree limb falling. Go to sleep. (Kevin whimpering) You wanna sleep with me? Come on. (chuckles) wipe your feet, huh. Okay. Shh. Come on, go on. Okay. - Eric? - what? - Why did we do it? - No questions. - But why did we have to do it? The house, all those nice things. The dog. - Those are only things, Kev. People are all that matter. What goes on in their minds. Now go to sleep. This is just a dream. (ominous music) (birds chirping) Kev, wake up. Come on, wake up. Let's go, we gotta start back. Come on. Do you remember last night, everything? - [Kevin] Yeah. - If you say anything to your folks, I'll cut out, and your father will have to pay for the damage. Do you want me to leave? Tell me. - I guess not. - Now you've got to be sure. I don't know if I can trust you or not. - No questions. (laughs) - [Eric] Your move. (gentle music) (trolley bell rings) (bright music) - I said a small shrimp cocktail. - You like a drink to go with it? - No, thanks. You should have gone with them. - Riding a cable car isn't my style. - Oh, really? What is your style, Eric? - You want me to split, right? I like you, all of you. You're interesting people. I'm learning a lot being around you. - Oh, really? Well I've learned something about you, Eric. Like your effect on Kevin. - Lay it on me, Mrs. L. - He's changed since you went camping. - [Eric] changed? How? - Subtle ways. He's quieter than normal. He's moody. He won't confide in me. What happened, Eric? - Nothing. He got a little frightened. Had a nightmare or two. That's all. - I don't believe you. - Besides, it's par that he doesn't confide in you. - What are you insinuating? - Nothing personal. Boys that age don't really confide in their parents. Especially their mothers. I'm a psych major, remember? You'd know it too, if you'd read your spock. At least most mama's would. (glass clinks) (gentle music) (customers chattering) - [customer] Excuse me. - Excuse me. (muffled whispering) - Yeah. (dramatic music) - Mom! Mom, you should've come, it was so much fun. I went on the outside of the trolley car all the way up and all the way back, too. - Hi, honey, you have a good time? - Fine, Eric bought me lunch. - Well, I thought we were gonna eat at Fisherman's wharf. I didn't want you to spoil your appetite. I mean, I thought we could eat together. - I only had part of a shrimp cocktail. - Where is Eric? - I don't know, we were in a bookstore and he just disappeared. - He what? I didn't allow for this, I mean, we gotta make tracks outta here. What did you say to him, honey? - What can I possibly say to discourage him from continuing his free bus ride? He told me you had nightmares the night you two camped out. Now I told you I didn't want you to go, Kevin. - It's not Eric's fault. Kev knew what he was getting into. I mean, it's, you know. Oh, look, four o'clock. If we're gonna see the tall ships, we gotta go now, okay? - What about Eric? - He knows where we're going. He can meet us there tonight if he wants to come, okay? - He might not remember. - He'll remember. (mysterious music) (crickets chirping) (knock on door) - [Dana] It's for you. - I'll be right back. (door thuds) (gentle music) I don't trust you. (cards clack) I think you cheat. - [Kevin] But Mom, you don't know what you're doing. Here, let me show you. - [Rita] No, you had your turn. - [Kevin] Deal. - All right, go ahead. How am I ever gonna learn? - Dana, your son's turning into a regular card shark. - Is everybody ready? - [Rita] Ready. - Aces are wild, right? - Aces are wild. (bright music) woo-hoo. (bell rings) ♪ See the writing on the wall ♪ ♪ Do you still see me ♪ ♪ Is the curtain about to fall ♪ ♪ Do you still want me ♪ ♪ There's a man on the edge ♪ ♪ will he jump off ♪ ♪ see the bird on the ledge ♪ ♪ will he live to tell ♪ ♪ Maybe there will be tomorrow ♪ ♪ Don't say goodbye ♪ ♪ Do you remember ♪ ♪ The one you leave ♪ (seagulls squawk) (waves crash) - [Rita] 1 0 years of my life I've taking care of him! - [Dana] No, how can you say that? - [Rita] Not once did you do it, that's all you are! - Listen, listen to me, - why don't you-- - goddammit, you gonna walk out on him? Shit. (door slams) (waves crashing) - Mom, Mom! Mom! I caught two fish. All by myself. - That's wonderful, honey. Why don't you have you father help clean them, okay? - Say, what do you think of Kevin? He's pretty good with that fishing rod, isn't he? - Eric, do your number on someone else, okay? - I'm not doing any number. You and Dana had another fight. I wanna help. - Then leave me alone. - You need to talk to someone, lady. You're like a pressure cooker inside - what the hell do you know about what's going on inside of me? What does anybody know? Especially a man. (cries) (gentle music) - In a way, my girl was like Dana. Our whole relationship was contradictory. It was a relief when she left me. - I wanted to leave him. A hundred times, I wanted to take Kevin and just go. But I kept thinking it would get better. It had to get better. It never did. You know, all he wants for me is being a housewife. That's all he sees in me. Oh, God, he's satisfied with so little. (gentle music) - [Eric] Put your arms around me. Trust me. I need you. Think about us. Only us. (dramatic music) (waves crashing) - Have you seen your mom? - No, sir. I guess she started talking to Eric. Want me to go find he? - Nah, she'll be back when she's ready. (knife scrapes) - You and her were fighting again, weren't you? When this vacation's over, you and her are gonna split up. - Well that's kinda up to your mom, really. - Why doesn't she wanna live with you anymore? - (sighs) Ah. It's kinda hard to explain, you know? - (sighs) You shouldn't have let me find out for myself. - Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute. Come here, come here, come here. (somber guitar music) - Ooh, cut and run, huh? Was I that bad? - Stop fishing for compliments. - [Eric] well? - You were great. Sensational, okay? I don't understand you. - Baby, nobody understand anybody. Once people start understanding one another, you get trust, and that's not how the world operates. - Dana trusted me. Never found a reason not to. Like now, tonight, I'll got back and whatever else he feels, he'll still trust me. You're the only man I've ever slept with besides my husband. I felt passion for you. Something I thought I'd never feel again. - Then you're free. - I'm not free. He's taken a third of my life. That's all he's gonna get. - Then the only thing you can do is divorce him, isn't it? (dramatic music) (ominous music) (waves crash) (seagulls squawk) (dramatic music) - You have to be a lot quieter than that, Kev. You're up pretty early. Are we ready to roll? - Yeah, I just woke up and I thought I'd come see you. - You sleep okay? - Yeah, except for my mom waking me up when she came in. Did you sleep okay? - Perfectly. I never remember my dreams at night. That's what makes most people restless. You know that? - No. - It's true. Come on. - [Kevin] My mom and dad are making fish for breakfast. - (laughs) surprise, surprise. And then he said, "I think I've caught a fish." - That's not true, (Eric laughs) that's not true. - Now I figured he caught his line on a log or something. - Dana, this knob is loose on this stove of yours. - It worked fine the last time we cooked out. - You should have bought a stove. Then what happened? - By now, he was on his little butt being sucked out the water like a minnow. (laughs) - That's-- - I'll check it out tonight. - Dana, do you wanna hear the rest of this? - No, Kev told me last night. - Fish looks good. Try it, Kev. - I'm not hungry. - You, young man, are gonna eat it. I just got third-degree burns trying to fry it. Well I'm gonna eat it. (sighs) - So am I. - Mm. - Is it good? - It's delicious. - [Eric] oh, it's fantastic. (Eric chuckles) - Dana? - Yeah, I'll try some. - Even the mercury content isn't too high. (Kevin and Dana laugh) - [Eric] Dana suspects. - I know. - He'll put up with me for a few more days. You're cool about it all of a sudden. - I'm not cool, I'm resigned. He's gonna fight me for Kevin in court. But it's nice to see him miserable for a change. - When you're divorced, will you become a full-time designer? - Yeah, I'd like to. But that takes money and connections. Half of what Dana makes isn't very much. - Is he insured? - To the hilt. We're insurance poor. - Then there's more profit in being a window than an ex-wife. - I hadn't thought about it. - Accidents happen. All the time. - Dad? - Mm. - There's a 31 Flavors in the shopping center. Do you want an ice cream? - Well you know, I'm still kinda full from lunch. But thanks anyway. - Dad, maybe it would help if I talked to Mom. She get nervous and upset with me all the time. Maybe she'll get over it. (bright guitar music) - I got an idea. Chocolate mint chip. Two scoops. - I'll be right back. - Hey, uh, you wanna go to a movie tonight? - Hey, yeah! - Okay, we'll see about it. - Okay. (sighs) - [Eric] Jump. - Let's go, come on. - Yeah. - Let's go, jump! - Let's go - Butterfingers. - You better take some sweaters tonight. It'll probably get chilly. - [Eric] come on! - It didn't seem to bother you last night when you were out for hours. - I wore a jacket. - Oh. Besides honey, I'm not going. - Kevin'll be disappointed. It was your idea. - (sighs) I just don't really think I wanna sit through a movie tonight, you know? - [Eric] who is that dude? - Driving's getting to me, I don't know, so. I'll just get to bed early. - All right. (Kevin and Eric chattering) Goodbye. - [Dana] Have a nice time. (sighs) - You might as well know the truth and take it, tough as it is. We're through, see? I'm not the guy for you. I've had plenty of girls and I'll have plenty more. You're pretty sweet. It's been awful nice. But this is a stopping off place. - This is getting to me. I'm going for some air. - [Woman From Movie] I won't let anyone else have you. I won't! - [Man From Movie] well now come on now, be a good sport, stella. Let's finish it like we began it, with a laugh. (suspenseful music) Come on now, laugh. Smile now. - [Woman From Movie] All right. - [Man From Movie] we've opened the cell door. She comes out, two matrons have to help her. (gas hissing) Very witty, all right? - stop it, stop it, stop it! (chattering in movie) (gas hissing) (dramatic music) - [Kevin] Mom. - [Rita] You stay here, all right? - What is going on? I know something is wrong, now tell me. - Just stay here. - What's Eric done? Dad. - Kevin! Kevin, I'll get a taxi. - Then get one, dammit! (dramatic music) - Just wait. (Rita coughs) (gas hissing) (Dana and Kevin cough) Oh, God, help me! Oh, no! (cries) - Get somebody! I don't know if he's alive! - Kevin, listen to me. It's an accident. If the police come, it's an accident. - Eric did it. - He's gonna think I'm guilty too. Kevin, listen to me. We don't know how it happened. Do you hear me? Remember that. (Kevin cries) - Doctor says he'll release me tomorrow. - That's wonderful. - It was my fault, you know, you, you told me to fix the oven. - The sheriff thinks-- - The sheriff is satisfied that your husband's a careless idiot. Which he is. (Rita cries) - [Rita] what about the trip? - Well, Kevin was really counting on seeing the ghost town in Nevada. It's only a couple of more days. What about our passenger? - That's up to you. - I'm not blind. It's up to you, honey. Kevin. (dramatic guitar music) Hi, Tiger. Come here. Your mom told me what you did. Thanks. - Why are you still here? - You botched the job for me. Why? - You bastard. We may have had sex, but Dana's worth a hundred of you. For all his faults, he's flesh and blood. But you, you're twisted. - Aren't we contrite this morning. - Go away, Eric! Work your black magic on someone else. - But it's getting interesting. Besides, you're not gonna say anything, are you? - If I had the courage, I'd go to the sheriff and I'd tell him everything. - If you had the courage. - Kevin knows. - How? - He knows you. - What about us? Does he know about us, Rita? - Yes. He thinks that you and I had something-- - You and I planned to kill Dana, right? And you're his mother, so he can't say anything. Not even to his beloved father. - Eric, leave us alone! - I don't think so, Rita. And if you do say anything to Dana, I'll turn us both in. (dramatic music) (rain pattering) - Kevin, how about a game of poker? - Not right now, Eric. He's helping me drive. (upbeat flute music) - Eric, do you mind, I have a headache. - Dad, watch out! (dramatic music) (tires screech) (camper crashes) - You okay? (Rita gasping) Honey. (Rita sobs) Shh, shh, shh. Everything's okay, nobody's hurt. We're fine, shh, we're fine. Everybody's okay. - Kevin, Kevin. - Kevin's fine. We hit a slick corner. (Rita sobs) We're not hurt at all, Kevin, come here. Come here, man. Come here. (Rita sobbing) - Leave me alone, leave me alone! - Hey, hey, stop, stop. - Don't touch me every again! - Ouiet, quiet. Take it easy, what's the matter with you? It's okay, easy. (sobbing) Shh, easy. - Haven't you got something you can give her? - A pint of whiskey above the sink. (Rita sobbing) Hey, hey, come on now. Here sit up. There you go, that's enough, easy. (thunder rumbling) (rain pattering) (dramatic music) No need in both of us getting wet. - Well I can provide moral support, if nothing else. - Suit yourself. We'll just be right outside fixing the motor home, checking for damage, okay? - Dana, please don't go out there. - Why not? Don't worry. Everything will be fine. (thunder rumbling) (rain pattering) (lightning strikes) (sighs) - Kevin, don't look at me that way. You knew what he was like before I did. You're as much to blame as I am. (suspenseful music) (thunder rumbling) (thunder rumbling) (rain pattering) (lightning strikes) - Yeah, that should see us through the rest of our trip. - It's over for you, Eric. (lightning strikes) - What did you just say, this. - Now you give me that choirboy smile. - Look, Dana, I didn't do anything. Your marriage was on the rocks before I even met you. - It was none of your goddamn business. - Look, man, do not leave me in this friggin' rain. - Get your gear. - Hey. (fist thuds against stomach) (Eric groans) (fist thuds against stomach) (Dana grunts) (dramatic music) (engine stalling) (pounding on door) Open the door! Kevin! Kevin! (pounding on door) (tires screech) (dramatic music) (birds chirping) - [Rita] Dana. - Shh. Now go back to sleep. I'm just gonna go outside and get some air, okay? It's not even morning yet. (ominous music) - [Eric voiceover] This afternoon, I meet the Lunds. They'll do very well for my next case study. The husband is a typical product of a lower-middle class upbringing. To him, I must represent the companion he cannot be to his son on this trip. The wife is a bundle of raw nerves and sexual repressions. I win Kevin over completely. He'll be the perfect specimen for that experiment I've long had in mind. What a chance to study the corruption of innocence. Will I be a marked change in his personality? He's shattered by the experience at the farmhouse. I can even turn him into a homosexual if I want to. I've complete power over him. Rita is only a little harder to get to. She's highly ambitious, and her bond to the family frustrates the realization of her dreams. As expected, she's transposed the blame onto Dana, and he can't understand why he's inadequate. Underneath all the anger and frustration, there is a deep caring, even longing in Rita for her husband, and she doesn't even know it. She hasn't had sex in so long, there's isn't anything I can't get her to do, but I have to hold it down to gain her confidence. Unlike Dana, she knows there's been a change in the boy. Rita botches the job on Dana. If she'd only stayed away a few more moments, but she panicked and Kevin figured out what I was up to. But it isn't a loss. What a study in psychology it provides. Rita's emotional instability brings her to the brink of hysteria. She's become intensely paranoid, so it's not difficult to keep her quiet. Kevin turns on Rita, thinking she's in some way responsible for the attempt on his father's life. He's the most interesting of the three. In less than a week, I've managed to alter his personality, his entire outlook on life. Of all the subjects I've experimented with, he's been the most successful. By far. - Want some more ice tea, Dana? - No, thank you, honey. - How about some cake, Kevin? - [Kevin] No, ma'am. - Just a little peace? - I said, no! (Rita sighs) (silverware clinks) (ominous music) (window shatters) (dramatic music) Dad. - Yeah. - [Kevin] can we go up to the old mine now? - I thought we were gonna go tomorrow. - Well, we'll just look around. - (sighs) You know, Kev, I'm pretty beat. Um, oh, look, if you wanna go, you can go, it's okay with me. Just be careful with the buildings and stuff. We don't know what kind of condition they're in. - Okay. - Honey, it'll be dark soon. Tell him not to stay too long. - Back before dark. - Yeah. - 30 minutes. - Yeah. - Yeah. (dramatic music) (door creaks) (suspenseful music) (clattering) (dramatic music) - It's no good, Kev. (Kevin panting) I'm stronger than you are. Remember when I showed you how to bait your line. Well, you're my bait now. I want my notebook back, (Kevin groans) And you're gonna get it for me. Okay, now listen, you know where it is. And don't forget, I can hurt ya if I want to. - I don't know anything about it. - I think you do. Well, we've got all night to find out about it. Come on. (Kevin whimpers) (suspenseful music) - Dana, I'm worried. - (sighs) He'll be back. You know how curious he is. - That's why I'm worried. He could have fallen into am mineshaft. You shouldn't have let him go. - You could have told him not to go. - He won't listen to me, can't you see that? - Why is that, Rita? You're right, I shouldn't let him go. (suspenseful music) Kevin? Kevin? Kev? Kevin? - Dana, did you find him? Kevin? Kevin, is that you? (wind howls) (crickets chirp) - I have your son, Rita. (dramatic music) Before you scream, remember, I have Kevin. You want him back, you'll give me my notebook. - What notebook? - Don't play dumb with me, Rita. My research notebook. With my case histories. No where is it? - Eric, for God's sake, where is Kevin? - First, we'll take a look in the motor home. And if I don't find that notebook, you're coming with me. (suspenseful music) (Rita groans) (sighs) - Rita. (dramatic music) Oh, my God. - [Eric] Don't go near him. Now, what did he do with my notebook? - I don't know anything about your damn notebook! Now let Kevin and me go! - I said, leave him alone. Now Rita, that notebook was very important to me. It contained my life's work. One of you knows where it is. I think I know how to make one of you talk. (dramatic music) (Kevin whimpering) Take off your clothes. Undress. We've made love before. You enjoyed it. - Not in front of Kevin. - Baby, that's the whole point. (Kevin whimpering) (blade clicks) - Eric, please. - Take off your clothes. (dramatic music) - [Dana] Kevin! Rita! (window shatters) (banging on door) Kevin! Rita! - Kevy, don't look, please. - Don't talk to him. (Kevin groans) (Rita cries) - Don't look, honey. - You're gonna look, or I'll cut your eyes out. (dramatic music) - [Rita] Dana! Dana! Dana! (whimpers) (gasps) (door smashes) (pole whacks against body) (Eric groans) (Dana groans) (fist thuds against stomach) (fist whacks against face) (Dana groans) (foot thuds against body) (Eric pants) (Rita screams) (elbow whacks against face) (dramatic music) - Come here. (Kevin grunts) - [Kevin] Mom, Mom, no, Mom! No, Mom! (Dana screams) (pole whacks against body) (pole whacks against body) (Eric groans) - No, stop it! (cries) (Kevin whimpers) Oh, my baby. (Rita cries) - Kev, are you all right? - He kept talking about a notebook. - I destroyed it. - What was in it? - Lies.
