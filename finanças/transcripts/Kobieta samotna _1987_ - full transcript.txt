Oh, Jesus! Bogus, come on! Bogus, wake up, sonny. - Come on, wake up. - Just a moment... Wake up, boy. Get up. Bogus, get up now. Mummy hasn't got any water. Move on, sonny. Faster, faster, come. Here are your pants. Sonny when you go to school, lock it all up. And when you come back, don't go anywhere. Stay at home and don't go playing in the backyard. I... I have to go now. Good-bye my dear. OK. SINGLE WOMAN Starring Screenplay Director Good morning, good morning. - Who's there? - The mail. - Good morning. - Good morning. They keep on writing, they sent me a parcel. - Do you need the stamps? - Excuse me? - My son collects stamps... - I am afraid I can't. Excuse me. Jola! Mrs Pawlowska! Mrs Pawlowska! Jola, come back home! - Have you got anything for me? - No. - Who's there? - Mr Grochala? - That's me. - I brought your disability pension. It is broken. Please, come in. This way. Here. I have just move in. - I caught a bit of cold. - Yes, the weather these days... What happened? Are you all right? Maybe some water... or some tea? Freshly prepared. Thank you. Maybe I should open the window? It's a bit stuffy here. No, no, I feel much better now, thank you. I am sorry to be a problem for you. What are you saying! Please, leave it alone! Dear sir, I will be gone in a second! No, no, please, sit down. - I... I just don't know... - No... I just don't know what happened to me... God forbid, you may faint in the street. I haven't even paid your pension. Here you are. Please, sign on the dotted line. - You should take some rest. - Yes, I should. Thank you. I am so sorry. I really don't know what happened. Good bye. No problem... I always... Good bye. What are you doing sonny? What are you making such noise? - I was afraid. - So why do you sit in the dark? - There is no electricity. - What could have happened? - Marolewski switched it off. - Why? It was Szajna, he screamed. Give back the fuse. Do you think that as I am single anyone can hurt me? I am going to do even worse until you move out. God will punish you. It wasn't God that brought here to harm us. - Mummy? - Yes? I would set the house on fire. Ours would burn down as well. What would we do then? They would have to find some substitute place for us. Don't you be such a wise ass. He will be punished anyway. - Is it always so? - Always. - Every bad deed must be punished. - You just say so. Say your prayers and go to sleep. In the name of the father, the son and the holy ghost. My guardian angel stand thou always by my side. Protect me during the day and the night, and come to my rescue whenever needed. Move aside a little... - The body of Christ. - Amen. Congratulations on your great day, Bogus. You will come to us at six, won't you? Well, tomorrow I have to go early to Bydgoszcz... - Business trip. - You're his godfather. You visit us so seldom. Do I have to beg? - We will certainly come! - Mummy bought vodka and sausages! Shut up! Naturally, we will come. We just can't stay long. You also have to be at work early in the morning. What did you do? What did you do? Tell me! The guy picks on you but you can hardly blame him when the party guys sent him a woman with a child. This was not his room. It wasn't his but could have been. Neighbours are the worst scum. You should join a housing cooperative Irka... And wait fifteen years for a flat. I heard that if I gave twenty thousand bribe... They don't take any bribes. They are too afraid. You see. Now you just can't get anything done. You should join the Solidarity trade union. And what is this Solidarity? Solidarity has no flats to give. But you are among other people. Bogus has got only me. I can take no risk. What risk? What are you bubbling about? And if anything changes? You know it was the party committee that gave me this room. I sent them a letter in a bouquet I gave during the Labour Day parade. If they get to know that I joined the trade union - they can take it away from me. - Eee... Nobody backs me up, nobody helps me. Should Bogus go back to the orphanage? - This way we are at least together. - You know, Irka. If you think so, go to the party committee - and may the party help you. - You think I should go? I did write, I asked... it is so difficult, you know? - All the best! - Goodbye. Thank you. - Goodbye. - How is the aunt? I have visited her recently. She feels a little better these days. Did you know that we had arranged that Julek will get her place? - You did? - Yes. - Good bye. - Good bye. Bogus! On your knees! But you know that can't visit you any more often. I come just as often as I can and you know it. I know, my child, I do. You could bring Bogus over. - How is he doing? - He is healthy. Learns a lot... he just... have gotten so nervous. - Did he make his first Communion? - He did. You know, I don't have the time for him. He learns such dirty words at school... Jesus Christ! They say dirty words even on TV. You can hardly blame children. Oh, Jesus! Oh Jesus and Mary! - Are feeling any worse? - Oh, my God! - What did the doctor say? - And what does a doctor know? Only the Lord will know when my time comes... The doctor only prescribes medicines and... Oh Jesus! Nothing much, the chemists don't have any drugs, you know... Oh Jesus! Irena, have you got some chocolate? Don't you have a little chocolate? Bogus gets one per month - that is his ration. - He eats it immediately. - I would like to east something sweet. Or maybe sour... Some sweets... - I will mix some eggs with sugar. - But there is no sugar. I would like to die now! What are you talking about, auntie? - Before the war starts. - What war? There will be no war! - There will be war, my dear child. - Oh, Jesus! They can't leave people alone. It is better to keep quite. There will be no justice in the world anyway. I just can't listen to that, auntie. We have a powerful army, I have seen it recently on TV. Bogus loves to watch the army. He says he is going to be a general when he grows up. Oh, he will be a general... Are you asleep? I have to go. Irena, this week I also had to pay for her shopping! I got it here. She asked for juice, quarter pound of butter, I gave my own, milk and bread. I summed it all up. It is 53 zlote and 20 groszy. - She doesn't give you any money? - You know what she is like. This is 55. I don't have any change. Some other time. - Good bye. - Good bye. Come here, come on! - Mary, come here! - House search! Who are you looking for? - Witkowski family. - Come inside... - I... - Please, come in. - I brought money and a letter. - Witkowski! Please, come in. This is for you. Here you are. And I will take this... Here you are. Good morning. Oh, it's you. - I don't have anything for you today. - No, I was just passing... - How are you? - Thank you, I'm fine. This bag looks heavy... Maybe I could... - I can't... - I am not that handicapped... No! Washing powder will be delivered at noon. If you need any... I always buy for my neighbours, I have a special card... I can arrange it. So? Zbyszek, let me go! Let me go, I can't! What is it for? Let me go! I can't, I can't! What's going on? Stand up now! Enough of this noise! - Who do want to see, comrade? - Me? Yes, comrade. Who do you want to see? - But I am not a comrade. - Have you got a pass? - What pass? - Have you got an appointment? - Not really... - I am very sorry... But... I came hear to make a complaint! It seems you got a wrong address. Where am I to go? This is the authority. - What is your business? - It's about an apartment. Go to the city council, housing cooperative, - and now please leave! - I want justice! Go to the court! Please, leave now! I am not moving until I can see someone important. How long must I live like a dog? Marolewski will hurt my child! I can't stand it any more. Someone must help me! Please, leave! Please! What is going on, comrade? - Let's go. - No. - What is behind this wall? - Trees. - And this one? - Prisoner of war. - And what is this? - Russians. Church... and they are shooting. - It is all very nice... and this? A German. These are all Germans. They listen to his commands. This is very nice. Please, look how well he can capture the movements. So will you be a painter, Bogus? - Do you like to paint? - Yes. Paint me your mummy. Look how beautiful she is. If I were you I would paint her all the time. How do you cope with your pension? You must make some additional money. - Yes, a little, here and there. - You don't work, do you? Oh, no. They won't fool me again. I worked long enough for them. Three years at the coal mine until the accident, thank you very much. I prefer to wait in queues rather then get killed. There is no future for me here. - I am thinking about going abroad. - When? Maybe next year. Now everybody leaves. Simple calculation. I have friends from Walbrzych, they write to me still. I don't feel well here. People here are... if somebody is different, they mock him immediately. Don't you have any family? My mother died when I was six. My father went to an asylum. And a wife? Somehow it didn't happen... I had the accident quite early and... you know. What are you talking about? Your leg doesn't matter. I have already told you it is nothing. You are a little shy, aren't you? It isn't true. I am just afraid to talk to people. - Everyone will misinterpret... - Misinterpret? I think it is easier to speak in a foreign language. - Wouldn't you regret? - Regret what? I don't know. The country? I would never leave Poland. And what is so special about Poland? There is nothing here. One live just anywhere. I can make a lot of money there and come back in a Mercedes. Mercedes uses a lot of fuel. So I can buy a Trabant. It is a good car as well. Eee... And you? What make of car would you want? Fiat 125p like uncle Wladek has. Could you send me some stamps? I like those with soldiers and animals best. - Bogus, don't disturb us. - May I go watch TV? Naturally. Just be back soon. Nice kid... No... And you? What about me? Could you tell me something about you? About me? There was nothing interesting in my life. Only things I want to forget. Irena, please... I would like that very much. If you want me to. I have nothing to be ashamed of. Bogus's father wasn't my husband. I don't think it's a sin. I had a husband once as I told you. I broke off with Bogus's father when I was in the six month and he beat me up. My father also used to beat me. I was the weakest, my sisters knew how to defend themselves. He was killed in an accident. He was drunk. He looked awful in his coffin, skin was wiped off his face... The worst thing was that I was happy that he died. I felt such a relief, you know. I forced myself to cry but I couldn't. I don't want the boy to hear that. I always tell him that his grandfather was a good man. He needs a role model in his life... He has you. No, no, I am no model for the boy. I am nobody. I have never been at a war, I don't have a car. I get paid peanuts, nobody respects me so neither does he. Sometimes I have to beat him up. It's for his own good so I do. And then I cry... I don't know how to bring up my child to be a good decent Pole. I don't know what to do. I can only pray so I pray. I just don't know what to do... Maybe it is good that there is no time for thinking in our lives. Irena, Irena... Are you OK, Jacek? I have never felt so good... Do you believe me? Bogus will be back soon. I remember when you first came to me. You were so thin in your dress. I wanted to kiss you, hug you but I just didn't know how. I remember how you were afraid of the storm. There were lightnings and you cried and I beat you with a dish-towel. I couldn't forgive myself for that. I was so mean to you. But it was all for your own good. You will forgive me for that. I did not want to leave this apartment to you. I thought you'd be waiting for me to die. And I knew I would die soon. Irka, this is cancer, isn't it? What good have I done in this world. Nothing. I have never been a problem to anyone. I have always been alone. I would like to live a while longer. Not much, just a little. When the day comes... I am not afraid. But I would like to live a little longer. I am alone. She circles around me like a crow... Just waits for me to die. She has fallen asleep. That's the way she is now: She talks, talks and falls asleep. She is getting worse every day. If anything happens, please, send me a cable. I bought her apples this week. If she wants anything more, you have the money. We must be human, mustn't we? That's me! Oh, my God. I thought it was Marolewski and I got so scared... - I have been waiting. - I went to visit my aunt. She lives thirty kilometres away. She is ill so I visit her regularly. I have been waiting for so long. They have wilted a little. Irena, I love you. I know, a woman like you, experienced... I am just a pensioner, I have no apartment... I am nobody... - An invalid like me... - Jacek, you are too young for me. I have a child, my life is over. I am not that young, I just look young! I can't talk nicely... I have never met anyone as good as you... I just don't know what I will do if you chase me away! - I am not chasing you away. - Please, kiss me. When was the last time I got flowers? Where is Bogus? He is gone to watch TV. He is so curious. I don't take him to my aunt. Why should he watch the age and the dying? Is that aunt rich? The aunt is awfully mean. She saves everything she can. - Does she have any children? - None, just me, I take care of her. Of the aunt? It may be a sin to think so but if she has to die, - she may help me as well. - It's not a sin. A man must have money, only then he is really a man. I would be a different person if I had a car, money... Bogus is not coming back. He should be doing his homework... It is all right... - I must cook some soup... - The soup can wait... Maybe that's the way it has to be... Our joyful hearts beat. We start our parade. It is the day of the free. Our flag is unfurled, it is our pride and glory. We shall always lift it high! Oh, Jesus! Ladies and gentlemen! After an investigation we know the perpetrator. Why should everyone pay? The Third of May decorations were destroyed by Bogdan Misiak. - Who? My Bogus? - Well, well, and we all have to pay. But it's impossible! I am sorry, that is what the pupils told us. - And the janitor saw it too. - They lie because they don't like him. If the janitor saw it, she could have stopped him! These are minor details. The important things is that labour of many pupils was destroyed and it costs us money. It is the Third of May decoration. It isn't just anything. Provocation! Provocation! Do you want to make a child an inciter? I mean this the first time we can celebrate the Third of May and this brat destroyed it! Even if Bogdan destroyed anything, he didn't mean to. He is just a child! He is nervous. The doctor said he is overly excitable! We can't blame everything on Misiak... Madam, this is not the first time Misiak wrecks havoc! He has been impossible to control recently! - Yes, he has beaten up my boy! - He bites, he tortures animals. And now there are losses and someone has to cover them. Why me? She brought a hooligan and she doesn't want to pay! - Call the police! - Exactly! Call the police! You have all children hooligans but you inform on my boy because nobody will support me! You are one gang, you taught you children to inform! Bogdan did not do it, can you hear me? He is a good boy! He is a good boy but he can't stand it. Everyone informs on him because they know he is alone. Shit! You are all big fish but when it comes to paying the poorest has to do it! You shouldn't worry. You said the right thing but you should have been calm. They will get even with the boy. - We will talk, you brat! - It wasn't me. They couldn't just imagine it all. Listen, what happened on the third of May? A constitution against communists... You will have to pay the money. How? We live on a shoestring... We will think of something. Go away! That's the way you greet me? You got old, looking bad. - You found yourself a lover? - Why did you come? To my son. You can't forbid me. Bogus, Bogus, your daddy has come. I brought you candies, please, take it. Come on, you haven't eaten candy! Take it! Wait! Here you are, it's from your father, get yourself a badminton. You don't want to say hello to your daddy? Is that the way you brought him up! I brought him sweets... - Come here you brat! - Get out! - Get out now! - Me? Get out! Just a moment. You came to visit so please sit down. And you? Who are you? You should introduce yourself, I was here first. She found herself a defender. You dog! You dick! You wanted to visit your son. He is OK. - Don't speak foul in his presence. - You shit! Get yourself your own child and don't meddle! Leave him alone! I am going to call the police! Help! Help! Hit me! Hit an invalid if you are so brave. You are sick? Leave her alone, let her be. Listen, you can do whatever you want. I brought sweets for the boy. Am I not a man? Can't they behave? Good evening, daddy? Thank you, daddy? May the devil take you all. Stupid cow, a brat, and a cripple... I don't need you all... - Is he gone? - Yes. Is that a show? Irena, lock the door. I am sorry. Let's go. - What did you tell him? - Nothing special. You are so courageous. He is a bandit. - He was just a little drank... - I didn't even make tea for you. Leave it! - What is it? - A letter. From whom? From my buddies. There is job, there is money. I just have to go. - Where? - Abroad. - And will you? - And would you like me to? What am I to say? It's your life, I have no say. This one or another, you just don't give a damn, do you? How dare you! Irena... Oh, my God! Irena, forgive me. Bogus, fetch me some water, your mummy fainted! - Jacek, go now! - Irena, I love you. I need you! Irena, oh my God! I love you, Irena. Why do you twist and turn so much? Are you hot? I can't sleep, mummy. Sing to me. I miss my girl and green Ukraine. My heart cries out because I will not see her again. - Close your eyes! - Why? - Surprise! - Now? Now. Aren't you happy? - What is this box doing here? - I bought it. - How? - I closed my house saving account. What for? - I thought you would be happy. - What about? We will have a TV set like any normal home. Normal... - What's going on with you? - Nothing. Switch it off! So now the boy will be at home all the time... A normal home... I thought it would be good if the child was at home. Very good, what do I care. You wanted a TV set, you got it. - I thought you would be happy? - Why? Should I be happy that the boy will be around all day long? Move that coal! Where is the pump? Where? Where is the pump? Did you see that? Just like Rosiewicz. - Don't you leave me now. - Tapping. Nice, isn't it? Don't you leave me now. What happened? Leave me alone, you dick! What was that for? Stop! - Apologize now! - I am sorry. - Don't you come here any more. - I won't. I won't! If I ever see you around here I will kill you. Mommy, don't cry. - Hail Mary... - Are you a relative? Yes. A niece. The closest relative. My most sincere condolences. We may talk about the funeral. Excuse me, but there were some problems. - Problems? - I am sorry. The deceased left with me some funds to cover the costs of her funeral. She hoped the rest would go to the church but... I am afraid the money want be enough to pay for the funeral. Why? She was an ailing bed-ridden woman, she did not realize... She left all her money to pay for her funeral? - That's what she said, but as I say... - So there is nothing left? I am afraid you will have to add some. Naturally, I will deal with all the church matters, tomorrow... a mass for her soul... Mom, why didn't we stay for the funeral? Don't lean out! - Mom, will you buy me a bike? - No! You promised you would when grandma dies. Mom, why doesn't Jacek visit us any more? Can't you just sit down in silence!?! No no no, Irena, this is not the way to work. People wait for their mail, it is late and you are daydreaming. Are you all right? - No. I am a little overworked. - My thoughts exactly. I have just been thinking that you work too much. The area you work in is too big for you... People who could deal with it do their share of work in not time at all! Why? You should swap your area and we shall find something easier for you. You want to take my area from me? I don't want to take it, I want you to swap. You said it yourself, you can't cope. - Who said that? - You did a moment ago. We both know that many people would like to get my area. I deliver a lot of postal orders and deliveries. - We all know well what this is about. - It has nothing to do with that. Your area is large and difficult and you are tired. - It is for your own good... - For my own good? I run around like a camel for peanuts and now you want to take these few additional pennies from me! Irka, don't get mad, everyone thinks that a good area is given once for a lifetime. My dear ladies, it is not what you think. Everyone wants to have it a little better! But do I work badly? I am never on doctor's leave. I took two days off once when my child was sick and once when I had to go to his school. I am doing my best... - People, why don't say something!?! - Why so nervous? We will talk about it later. And now I want you all delivering mail within a quarter. It's over. What are you saying? - Here you are. - 52. 88, please. - Thank you. - 87, please. - 94, please. - Here you are. - 83. - Sign, please. You didn't sign? Thank you. Mommy! It is so good that you came back home so early! What's for dinner? - Get your things, Bogus, we leave. - Where to? - Pack all your books. - All of them? - Mommy, where are we going? - Let's go. Madam, I really must go and I haven't got anyone to take care of him. I will take him back. Promise. I will take him back as soon as I can... Bogus, mommy will be back to get you in a few days, or I will send... I have no other choice. Please, understand me. Well, what can I do? You will be good? I have to do it. Bogus, dearest, be good, please. Don't be mad at me. Mommy! Mommy, don't leave me! Honey, please, let me go. I forgot. I have some stamps for you. Let me go! Tell me at least what happened. I told you we could not meet here. They are good people but they have their principles. - Once you came here, tell me... - Water is ready! I am sorry. You see! I told you there would be trouble. Where will I find a place now? Will you tell me what happened? Why didn't you come? I didn't feel well. Why didn't you let me know? I was afraid. - I don't owe you any explanations. - I was afraid... you would leave and I would be alone. My God, Irena... What's going on? What happened? What is it? Where is it from? Your aunt died? Irenka, don' cry. She was old and very sick... Everyone must die one day. I know you loved her but... don't cry... She saved a lot... and it was all for you? Well, only you took care of her... You see, Irenka, your aunt is dead but she wanted you to be happy. Don't cry. This is all for you. - Do you need a form? - Thanks, I've got it already. You will drive it for many years. I wouldn't sell it if I didn't have to. It's difficult for me to talk. Is it my fault I had an accident? Go work on a coal mine and then threw me out like a dog. That was all! Jacek, we will always miss you. We will never find such a quiet lodger. Such a kind... Five years, I asked for a special car but not, twenty six hundred zloty and go as you can, stand in queues and wait... You know whenever anything was broken, an iron, radio, anything, - he could repair it all! - I love mechanics! Irena bought a car. Tomorrow we will be abroad, you don't work hard but still you make enough! Don't I deserve anything? I went to the Solidarity. How can I join? Nobody knows. Everybody is running, running, and I just stand! I ask: Can you get me a car? Can they? They fight, they go on strike and how can I go on strike? I am finished. They told me to go make a complaint at the coal mine and what? They made me pay for the clothes which I allegedly destroyed... This is past, my dear, you start a new life. I have always dreamt about travelling. I wanted to see the world but I failed to. - You failed. - Well... My landlady has a kind heart. We will send you gifts, shall we, Irenka? Food! We must drink. And we will come back when they are gone! When all the thieves are gone! Is it just? There is no future here! We will invite our son because we have a son... Thieves! What did she get from life? Was it just? I will buy her clothes, we will save to buy an apartment, a house. My buddy writes from the GDR, another is in Sweden, o my God! Irenka, I am so happy I met you! No other... was ever like her... she would give me everything, you see? But will you two make it there? It is not easy there, just listen to the radio. I will work like a dog! I will become a different person! Maybe they can help with my leg! I will be flying! - It's nothing, don't worry. - Nothing will be wasted. We will leave you our rations. Irena, Irena... Jacus, calm down... Calm down. - I just can't believe it! - We will make it, you'll see. You know I have never seen any border. - Is there a wall or something? - There is a barrier. A river and you have to take a ferry or you fly by plane. Once we were supposed to visit Czechoslovakia with our trade union but there was no money. - How is it? - Now you can go anywhere. You need a special stamp in your identity card - but have it, don't you? - Well, I do. - Do they check it very thoroughly? - They just check the stamp. - And the photograph. - And it is the same in any direction? If you had not insisted that we must go immediately we would have bought something for trade. What can you get for trade? There is nothing here and they have it all. We would have come up with something. - You know it all... - I know a little because I used to read. Watch out! Irena, are you OK? I am fine... Jacek, what happens now? We need to stop a car and go back to the city. Or maybe you should stay here. Someone may try to steel parts from our car so I will drive to the city and come back with help. - No. - Why not? We have already lost God knows how much. We should have insured it but you insisted we had to go immediately. Jacek, I didn't inherit any money from my aunt. What? I stole the money. I stole it, you understand, stole! Irenka... I will go to the police and tell them all... - but not now. Tomorrow. - OK... tomorrow. Fuck! - We can still try to run away. - I can't. Don't be afraid, I will not tell them about you. Romek? I can't take it any more. Help me, do something. Don't be afraid. Do something so that it all was not true. I will. Do something so that it all was not true. I can't take it any more. I need a rest. I will, my dear. Don't be afraid. Don't be afraid. My wife stays in the room. She is very tired. Please, don't disturb her. Naturally. You know, I needed to tie it all up because I was afraid it would fall apart. The head. You must be careful. I had to tie it all up lest it should fall apart. - Like little hammers... - Yes. - I would like to see the ambassador. - What is the matter? I demand American guarantees... the suitcase... explosives... Would you mind waiting a minute? Will you be so kind to sit down for a second. The ambassador will be here any minute now... - I haven't got the time. - You have to understand us. We can't get a plane so immediately. You will wait a minute, we will get a plane and the ambassador. Please. This way, please. Take a seat. You can put the suitcase on the floor. Just a minute... He is asleep... Move aside! Send a car to fetch the suitcase! I was with the boys in the yard and my mommy flew over the orphanage. She threw me a letter. She wrote me: "My dear son, be good. I will come to take you soon and we will live together forever in our little home". English Subtitles: Krzysztof Fordonski
