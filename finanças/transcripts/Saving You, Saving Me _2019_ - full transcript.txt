Stop saying my daughter! My daughter! That's it? So we should forget about the prophecy and the consequences? I don’t care about the prophecy. Let them find someone else! Someone else? She must fulfill her destiny. Let's just... let's just take her away. - Go away. Let's go... - Where? Where? The only way is to put things to the blood regionals. I'm her father. I love her just as much as you do. You don’t love her! If you love her, you'll find another way. I have! I'm not doing this for the order. I'm doing this to save her. If the Scandals get a hold of her before the rituals take place... they'll kill her. The signature immortality lies within the rituals being performed. It's her birthright. And the only thing that will keep her safe. Every year afterwards, she will become stronger and stronger until her 21st birthday where she will become more stronger and more powerful than any vampire who's ever walked the face of this earth. Please! Please! - Please! - It's begun with her. So it can only end with her! I have a purpose in this world. I know it. Please help me. Tell me what that purpose is. Pass me a lighter would you? - Don’t smoke in my car. - What the hell is your problem? You're the one who decided to end it with Amber. Don't you ever say her name again. Still little sensitive. I see. Pass me a lighter would you? Fine. I'll get it myself. You want to smoke? Take it outside. This plan is so good. Yeah, she's right. I like it too. Good. Girls! What are you doing? We're making a plan. What for? Amber. What did I tell you about saying her name? We talked it over, and we realized we had to get revenge on her. Why? My girls and I, we have this little motto we go by. "We hurt those who hurt us." Revenge. What the hell are you guys talking about? She never hurt you guys. What the hell are you doing? Put that out now! You know, I still don’t get what your problem is. You've been acting like this for the past two days now. And I don’t get it. I mean, you're the one who ended it with Amber. So, this plan... tell me all about it. What is it? I'm sorry. I was just thinking about them. I understand. It's normal. Especially since you just got here. I just wish I could have done something. Your parents had terminal cancer. There was nothing you could have done. But stay by their side and love them. You feel like family to me. That's 'cause we're family. We're brothers. - So, last night was fun. - Last night was fun. How do you like the stew? Mm, it's okay. Why can't we eat human anymore? Boss, may I talk to you for a moment? Yes, come in, Robert. Please take a seat. Sorry to bother you right now, but Tom does not want to train today and he's not listening to me. So, you think that... Boss? Is everything alright? I need to talk to you Robert? What's wrong? I need you to do an assignment for me? Who is it? Before I tell you, I need your word that you won't tell a single soul about this. You have my word. Ok. This is not one of our everyday cases. I want you to find the girl named Amber, train her, and bring her here. Boss, I've done that before. This one's very special, for you and for everyone else. Because soon she'll be your new boss. Why would we need a new boss? You've been our boss for centuries. Because Robert, I'm not going to be here for very much longer. - Why? But... - I'm going to the Scandals - in a few days and... - Why would you even think of going to the Scandals. Because if I don’t go to them, they'll come here. And if they come here... you know what could happen. So this girl. She's the one we’ve all been waiting for. When you find here, never let her out of your sight. When Scandals find out about this, they will not hesitate to come after her. When that happens, it will be your job to protect her, no matter what you have to do. I will. I swear to you. Is something wrong? Boss has an assignment for me. - What? - I can’t tell you right now. What do you mean you can't tell me? You always tell me everything. Why is this any different? This is a special assignment. I'll tell you more when the time is right. Fine. Whatever it is you're doing, just be careful. Alright? I love you, Rob. Hi, what would you like? Just give me... whatever. I'll get you an Old Fashioned. Old fashioned. - Excuse me, miss? - Yes. You seem very familiar. Do I know you? No, I don’t think I've ever seen you before in my life actually. Well, in that case, let me introduce myself. - I'm Robert. - Amber. I don’t think I've ever met someone like you. Well, we just met. How do you know I'm not just some ordinary girl that you've met before? Alright. Well then, how about I get to know you then, right here, right now? Not up for it, huh? No. Bring it. - I’ll start with something easy. - Ok. - How old are you? - Twenty-one. - What's your favorite color? - Black. Really? Why do you look so surprised? Most girls would answer by saying pink or red. Well, I guess I'm not like other girls now, am I? Let's get to more specific questions. Alright. Lay it on me. Were you born here? No. I've moved to many different places. What's your relationship status? I rather not talk about that. - What happened? - It really doesn’t matter. You know, I may be wrong, but I've always heard it's better when you talk about it. This is a long story. I've got all night. I became close with these three women, Ruth, Claudia and Natalie. It was really great. Actually having friends for once. Until when I got to meet Ruth's friend, Brandon. He caught my eye suddenly and apparently I caught his. After that, we started to see each other more and more and... it got to the point where I would come to the place and immediately start talking to Brandon. Not even acknowledging my friends. One day, they were acting really weird towards me. Different, as if they would rather not talk to me. When it was over, they all walked out together not even acknowledging me. So, I was up to them and asked what their deal was. Then they just said that they were done with me. Eventually, it affected my relationship so bad with him, that he just... walked away from me. And then I got a text form Brandon, "It's over." You know, it really does make me feel better getting all that off my chest. It just... No one deserves to go through what you went through, ever. But I'm just glad you're doing better now. Yeah. Will you do me the honor of having this dance with me? I don’t know. Come on. What's the worse that could happen? Ok. You really seem so different from everyone else. I was just about to say the same thing. Yeah, um, you know, I completely lost track of time. I should probably start heading home. - You're sure? - Yeah, yeah, I'm positive. - At least let me walk you home. - No, no, no, I'm good. I'm good. Ok. See you soon. Get her! Please. Please don’t hurt me. Oh! She hasn't changed a bit. Still the fragile little girl that I remember. Yeah, she seems a lot shorter to me, too. Can we just do this and leave? Brandon? Hey, babe. - Looking good? - What's going on here? Well... I haven't seen you at the place in a little while. What happened? We miss seeing your pretty little face - around there. - We? You're saying you don’t remember us? Amber, I'm so disappointed. Ruth? Well, looks like she does after all. I have to say though, Amber, you really haven't changed. Ruth, what is going on? Well, like Brandon said, we missed you. And we just had to come and see you. Aren't you happy to see us too? I don’t know. Ruth, what happened to you? Who did that to you? The same person who's going to do it to you. Please! Amber. Amber, hey. Hey, it's alright. It's ok. - You're safe now. - Robert? Yeah, it's me. - Where am I? - You’re in my house. Why? - Oh my God! We didn't... - No, no! Trust me, I would only do that if you wanted to. So... then why am I in your house? - Well? - Amber, you don't... feel any different? Robert... what happened to me last night? You got beat up by Brandon, Ruth and two other girls. Oh my gosh! I'm sorry, Amber. So, what? You just saw me on the street and decided to take me to your house? Yeah. Why do I get the feeling that there's something you're not telling me? Go and look at yourself in the mirror. Oh my God! Take off your sunglasses. It's rude. Please sit down. Are you sure you want to do this? It's what needs to be done. Amber? Hey, hey, hey! Everything is going to be ok, Amber. - What's going on? - I'll explain everything later. But right now, you need to drink this. - Why would I do that? - It'll stop you from fainting. What the hell are you talking about? Please trust me. Come on. - How do you feel? - Full. I feel full. How is that possible after me drinking blood? You're a vampire. No, that’s... that's not possible. There has to be a logical explanation, because vampires, they are not real. We are real. And we've been around for a long time. If you're telling the truth, - then prove it. - What? Prove it. Why me? Because you are chosen. What do you mean chosen? You’re special. More special than anyone else. What's so special about me? There's a place far, far away from here that no one knows about except for the people that live there. These people are vampires. There's a person called "The Boss." He's in charge of everything that goes on with us. The last one we had... he's no longer with us. What happened? He went to the Scandals. Something tells me that's not a good thing. The Scandals are also vampires. Only problem is, is they are our enemy. All their leader wants is for the Scandals to be the only vampires to exist. So, this Scandals... did they kill him? Their leader did. Yes. Then why would he even go to them? The Boss was kind of like a psychic. He could always predict the future. All he told me was is... if he didn't go to them, they'd come to us. If they come to us, they won’t stop until they kill every single one of us. I don't understand Why you chose me. What exactly do you expect me to do to here? You’re going to be our new boss. - Look, I'm sorry... - Don’t you dare say sorry to me. I'm... - I'm not sure that I'm... - The Boss chose you for a reason, alright. He always choses his people wisely. This was meant to happen. You were meant to do this. Well, I'm sorry to break it to you, but I'm not. Come on, Amber. If it wasn't for this, what else would you be doing? I could always look for a job. Why haven't you? Don’t you think there's a reason why you haven't gone looking for a job, or tried to figure out what you could to be doing for the rest of your life? Don’t you think there's a reason you went through what you went through? My past has nothing to do with this. Oh, but it does. Everything you ever went through was like a pre-training for you. It all just made you stronger. You knew. What are you talking about? My past. You already knew about it, didn’t you? So, everything was lie then, right? Flirting with me, pretending to be interested, it was all because you needed something from me... - No. No! - Right? Look, yes he gave me your information, but I never read any of it. And I'm supposed to believe that? You don’t have to. But it's the truth. So, what then? I'm supposed to believe you’re going to be nothing - but honest to me from now on? - I swear. I swear. Fine. But if you ever lie to me again, I'll kill you myself. Fair enough. I can’t handle this. I know this is a lot to take in. Trust me, I know. But I believe the Boss made me do this for a reason. I'm glad he did. Why? I got the chance to meet you. If you want me to stop, I’ll stop. You wanted to see me, sir? There's going to be a new boss. I need you to find out who it is. Because if you don’t, we may not ever be safe again. - What do you like me to do, sir? - I don’t care what you have to do, who you have to kill. Just find who this person is and who’s protecting this person, then tell me. I'll handle it from there. Well... I didn’t think that it would be that amazing. - I did. - Ok, no need to brag. What do you mean brag? I mean, I know that wasn't your first time. - Wait, really? - Don’t laugh. I'm not laughing. It just... seemed like you knew what you were doing. Really? Well, in that case, brag as much as you want. What is it? It's... nothing really. You can tell me. Well... you know everything about me... but I haven't had the privilege of getting to know you. Alright. Well, I, uh... didn't have much of a regular childhood. Or a childhood at all for that matter. My parents were vampires. When I was five years old, the member of the Scandals came and... he turned them. And he said that, they could either turn me, or he would come back and do it himself. But my parents, they never did. They wanted me to live a normal life. Five years later, he came back and... he killed my parents in front of me. And he turned around smiling. He gave me a choice. To either join the Scandals, or join my parents. I told him I'd rather die than join him. Just as he was about to kill me... the Boss swooped in and ripped him to shreds. That same day... I had to leave with him and... leave the only home I've ever known behind. But only did he save me, he treated me like I was his own son. He trained me everyday for the rest of my life, until I was ready. I was 21, he turned me. It was weird at first... to have the strength and speed that I have. It's amazing that how in the blink of an eye your whole life can change. Everything you need to know is in this folder right here. - This is her? - Yes, sir. Are you positive? I've never been wrong before, sir. Leave me. Amber. So... how long have you been 21? Thirty years. So, it's true? - What is? - Well... I've actually read a lot of books about vampires. And one thing I read was how when you turn, you stay that same age forever. Hmm, so you've done your research on us. Well... Well, yes, the whole staying the same age thing is true. What about food? Oh, you want to know if you're going to bite - people's heads off? - Ok, well, that would be nice - to know. - You'll be happy to know that where we're going, there are plenty of animals. I don’t want to hurt any animals. - Ah, you’re one of those, huh? - Yeah. Don’t worry. We'll prepare the food for you. Ok well, that sounds a lot better. What about the eyes? They're only red when you first turn into a vampire or if you’re hungry. The rest of the time, they’re dark brown. What about our speed? - What about it? - How fast? Faster than you could ever imagine. Well, then how do you control it? That's something you'll learn how to do. - What? - Am I leaving here... - forever? - Yeah. And what about the Scandals? - What about them? - Will they come after us? - After me? - They might. I don’t know. Look, the Boss sacrificed himself... For us, for you. He knew this was meant to happen. And we'll be ready. - We're always ready. - And what if I'm not? Well, that's what the training is for? - What training? - The training that starts today. Oh. So, you ready to start the rest of your life? Well.. I have no choice, so I guess I am. You should probably change into more appropriate clothing. Right. I didn’t bring any... Oh, thank you. What are you change... Woah! Am I going to be that fast? - Give it time. - Cool. I want to do this alone. - But, sir... - I said alone. We'll start easy, ok? Small bag, quick combination. You're in your stance, right? Watch. You give it a shot. How was that? We got a lot of work to do. I'm coming for you. And I will find you. Come on, Amber. - I can’t do this. - What are you talking about? I haven’t been making any progress yet. This is hopeless. I can’t go with you. I'm staying here. What the hell are you talking about? - You have to! - I can't, Robert. I can't even defend myself. This is not something I'm capable of doing. That's why we train. We train non-stop. No matter how hard I train... I'll never be good enough. Can I tell you something? Ok. When I first became a vampire, I had to go straight into training too. And it sucked real bad. How bad? I can never win any fight that I got into. I would throw things just... way too far. I would even run into walls. - That's not funny. - No, it's not funny at all. Ok, it’s a little funny. But that's my point. We all start out bad. That's why we train, to improve and make ourselves better. Alright. - Let's do this again. - Alright. Now remember what I told you. Watch my every move, but anticipate what I'm going to do next, got it? Oh shit! Jump rope. How did you do that? Years of practice. But mainly timing and focus. Those are the two keys for this exercise. And you want me to do what you just did? That's the plan. Okay. Wait. What is it? I guess I'm just being paranoid... What the hell was that? - Robert? - He was part of the Scandals. How could he know I would be here? I don’t know. But they know you’re here. - So, what are we supposed to do. - We get out of here. If they ambush us again, we fight back. I thought I was going to lose you... forever. You’re never going to lose me. I promise. At least I know how to kill a vampire. What now, sir? I know where they went. That's where we're going. Everyone... - Tom... - Who is that girl? - This is Amber. - Why is she here? Stop pointing at her... please. I have some terrible news. Someone is no longer with us anymore. Who are you talking about? It's the Boss. How dare you say that? Do you think I would lie about this, brother? Tell us Robert? How did he die? Please tell us how he died, Robert? He went to the Scandals. He wouldn’t do that. - Not to us. - I'm sorry. Everyone, this is Amber. She's going to be the new Boss. So make sure you make her feel welcome. Dude, what about the shorts? Scandals. You got a spare change of clothes for me? Yeah. - I have to go, Amber. - What? I have to go after Tom. Where is she? Where is who? Where is Amber? I have no idea what you are talking about. See, I knew you would say that. Which is why I did this. - Robert, help me! - Let him go! I've got a great idea. Why don’t you and I make a trade? I'll give you him... and you give me Amber. That's not going to happen. I think Tom and I should get to know each other better. Don't you dare. I think we're going to go now. And when I get back... I expect you to give me what I want. What? You’re letting him take me? Help me! Robert! Robert. - How are you... - There are lots of things I didn’t tell you. - And for that, I'm sorry. - You're right. You should be sorry. All this because of you. You think I wanted this? You think I like the fact that I'm not around here - anymore? - There had to be another way. You didn’t had to sacrifice yourself. Remember when we first met? I had a vision that day. That you need to go on a very special assignment sometime in the future. And I knew... that it'd come with a great sacrifice. Me. - Me. - This isn’t fair. I didn’t deserve to lose you. Life isn’t fair sometimes, Robert. But right now, you got your family in there. You need to help Amber, so she can lead them. I know you can do it. But I'm going to be with you in here. Always. Wait... Robert, where's Tom? Robert. The Scandals. Oh my gosh! They took him. They took him because I didn’t give you - to them. - What are you talking about? - James wants you. - Who's James? Their leader. He's going to come back because he wants you. - Let's just give her to them. - Enough! She's the one we've all been waiting for. She's the chosen one. I'm the new boss here, but please just... call me Amber. We know what happened to Tom. But they didn’t come here for him. They came here for me. They’re coming back. I don’t know when, but I know that they are. And when they do... we'll be ready. And we will fight. And we will get Tom back. Now, who's with me? Yeah. Come on, who’s with me? Yeah! Then let's get started! Right! Right! Yes! Yes! Wait. Stop, stop, stop! If you two fight like that, you’re going to get killed. Ok, I know you're the Boss and everything, but trust me, I know what I am doing. So, why don’t you just back off, alright? - Morgan. - Shut up, Kaitlin. - I know what I'm doing. - I'm sorry to break it to you, Morgan, but you don’t. Listen, just let me give you a few tips to help you... Look, I don’t need help, especially from you. - Come on Kaitlin, let's just... - Look, I'm sorry, but... I don't think I was finished talking. Actually, when I'm done talking, the conversation is over. Remember that. And when I say that you should take my advice, you should take my advice. Unless you want to die. Morgan, just shut up and listen to Amber. Stop being stubborn. You should listen to Kaitlin. She's smart. And you should listen to me and mind your damn business! Look... I know you know what you’re doing. Why don't you try to turn, go in and then kick out. That will help your stance. Fine. Ow! Whatever. Don’t take it personally. Hello Amber. Hello. May I speak with you for a moment? Yeah. Come with me. What do you want? I just want to make sure that you’re ok. You did? You sure it wasn't Amber? - Both of us. - And why would she care? Because... she feels we're all a family, even if you don’t agree. I don’t. But... you could tell her that I really appreciated what she did, and it really did help. - I'm sorry, what? - I'm not repeating myself. Now go. My sister and I have to eat dinner. What can I help you with? I want you. I'm sorry. You heard me. I said... I want you. Well, I'm sorry, I'm not single, but also not into women. Well, I'm definitely up for the challenge. I'm pretty sure you could do way better. Oh, I know I can. So, why have you taken a sudden interest in me? Oh, I see you misunderstand my intentions. - Oh! - I'm not interested in you. Nor do I want a relationship. I just want sex. Well, I'm sorry but that's not going to happen. Come on, Amber. Do you really think Robert... could ever rock your world the way I know I can? How dare you say that to me? You know what, I don’t care if you could rock it better than him. I care for him too much to ever cheat on him. So, why don’t you do yourself a favor, turn around, and walk out that door and never talk to me like that again. Understand? You’re the first person who’s ever rejected me. And I've been with a lot of women. And for that, I respect you. So, I promise, I won’t talk to you again unless it has to do with my training. How does that sound? Fine. Now, please leave. So, you were talking to Susie? Yeah. Does everyone know her? She does have a reputation that upholds her. Well, it looks like I just ruined it. Oh, thank god! You actually thought that I would cave that easily. Well, I mean, she eventually gets - what she wants. - Well, this time, she didn’t. I promise. Did you have to tell me something? Yes, well... Morgan wanted me to personally tell you that she appreciated it. It sure didn't look that way. She doesn’t mean to be mean. She's just like that for the sake of her sister. So, Morgan and Kaitlin are sisters. I should have known. Ever since they both came here, Morgan has always been that way to protect her sister. Why would she have to act mean to protect Kaitlin? Look, we're all vampires here. We really are all a family. But you got to understand, us guys... we're always going to be guys. So, when we see a beautiful woman, we can get a little crazy. Oh, I'm beautiful now? Well, now that you mention it Morgan is pretty. Hey! Okay. Of course, you’re beautiful to me. What is it? What if something happens, Robert? What if we're not prepared when the Scandals come back? What if someone... dies? - That's not going to happen. - And how do you know that? Look, being the chosen one, makes you the most powerful person in the world. In a way, it shows people who you are. It can’t be changed, I'm sorry. I didn't ask for this, Robert. We're going to keep you safe. I promise. Someone knocked on the door. Something tells me that doesn’t happen. Come in. What the hell do you want? I came alone. And to see Amber. I'm sorry, but... who are you? I'm James. You can leave. Excuse me Robert, but I think that's up to Amber. - Come with me. - What? You’re the one who took Tom? Didn’t you? I'm sorry, Amber. But Robert left me no choice. What do you want? You. Well, there is nothing special about me. We both know there is. Well, I'm sorry, but you can’t have me. - I'm staying here, - May I? So, you’re the new Boss? It feels good, doesn’t it? Having all that power? You remind me so much of your mother? You know my mother. Knew darling. - Knew. - She is... she's dead? Unfortunately, yes. How did you even know her? Well... Amber... this is just sad. Don’t you recognize your own father? What? Hi, daughter. Well... I don’t blame you for not recognizing me. I was never there anyways. You’re not my father. - I'm so hurt, Amber. - You’re lying to me. I'm sorry, but why would I do that? You realize I could kill you right now? But I won't. Because for some reason, I actually believe you. I knew you were smart. Why did you give me away? Because... when you were born, the Scandals found me. They gave me a choice. Either join them and never see you again, or they kill you. I didn’t know what to do, I had no choice. Well, then how did my mother die? I turned her. She just didn’t make it. I believe you. But this doesn’t mean that I'm going to be a part of the Scandals. - I told you the truth. - So did I. Have it your way. But I'll be back. And just know, when I come back, I know you'll make the right decision. Don’t count on it. Oh, and James... if I somehow find out that you’re lying, well, I'm going to rip your head off myself. Right. I think you’re in my way, Robert. I'll be seeing you real soon. Amber. Amber, what happened? That bastard! Tell me what happened? - He's my... - What? He's my father, Robert. What the hell are you talking about? He's my damn father! What are you going to do? We're going to train. And when they come back, we'll be ready. But you leave that asshole to me. She's training everybody. I just know it. She thinks she's going to win. Tomorrow night is when we'll go. Kill every last one of them. But leave her to me. That's an order. - What was that for? - Just because. What's wrong? It's nothing, really. Well, now you have to tell me. Well, Tom... he's your brother, right? How come you never told me about him? I'm sorry. I shouldn’t have said anything. No, no, that's fine. He actually isn’t my brother. I was one of the first ones to come here. Trained every day of my life. People like me, we... we have to train the new people that come here. I was assigned to Tom. When he first came here, he was very, very shy. Practically terrified. So, I thought it would be best to get to know him, his past and everything. And well... when I did, I managed to crack his shell. He was actually very nice. But he also revealed his true personality. But we still got along. You know, I even opened up to him a little bit. And we felt like brothers, so we started calling each other brothers. I promise you... we're going to get him back. Alright everyone, stay alert. They can come from anywhere. We can't take any chances. Well, well, well. Look at what we have here. Where is my brother? He's safe. Hello, James. Hello, my darling. Now, listen. I don’t want to fight. You know what I want. Have you thought about it? I have. And? No. Pity. Robert. Robert! Robert, stop! Just, stop it now! Stop! Stop it now. Why don’t you give me what I want? No, no. I suggest you make your decision quick. Because I think your dear boyfriend is withering away. Don’t listen to him, Amber. Okay, alright, alright! I'll do it. I'll go with you. Don't do it, Amber. Come here. Amber, darling. I'm waiting. Well, I guess, you’re going to have to keep waiting. Now! How could you do this to me? How could you lie to me? Like you lied to me. What are you talking about? You’re nor my father. What the hell are you talking about? Of course I am. I read your story. You’re the poor little boy whose parents abandoned you out in the cold. So the Scandals, they came and they decided to take you in. And you've been with them ever since. Do you know what else I found out? You... killed my parents. You saw me with them one day and you wanted to have me to finally have a daughter. So you know what? I read the police report. They said that they didn’t know what had killed them. So you know what you did. You took me to the Scandals. But they didn’t want me. Did they? So, you had no choice but to leave me out on the streets. I do whatever needs to be done. To get what I want. And I will have you. You'll never have me. Ever! I suggest you all leave now. We'll be back for you, Amber. What do you want to do with it? Burn it. You know, when I think about what happened earlier, it made me realize how many people sacrificed their life for mine. You belong here. Yeah. I know we haven't known each other for very long, but I can't help but feel that it was meant to happen. You're the kindest, sweetest, most loyal woman I've ever known. And the only one I want to know. Amber... I love you. Will you marry me? I think that I would be... the happiest woman in the world. Yes, of course, I would love to marry you. - I love you. - I love you too. Dear Amber, if you're reading this letter, then that means that your father and I are no longer around. I just want to say that we have always loved you. We have always loved you so much. And even though we’re no longer around, I hope that you'll still be able to feel that love from us. I also am writing this letter because if anything, you need to know how special you are. Our family is special. For as long as a I can remember, our family has this bloodline were when we turn into a vampire, we're unstoppable. Indestructible even. They call us "The chosen ones." It's important that you know. So if you ever become a vampire, you must know that you'll be stronger than any of us would ever be. And if anything, you're the last one of us. I chose to keep us human, I just wanted to give you the best life you could have. I know that the Scandals will want their revenge. And when they do make their move, we'll be ready. We'll always be ready. Dinner. I've got some news for you.
