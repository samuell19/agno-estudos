WOMAN (narrating): You've got to climb Mount Everest to reach the Valley of the Dolls. It's a brutal climb to reach that peak. You stand there, waiting for the rush of exhilaration, but it doesn't come. You're alone, and the feeling of loneliness is overpowering. I never meant to start that climb. I took the first step the day I left New England and headed for New York. It wasn't easy to leave that wonderful old house. My grandparents lived there and their grandparents before them. It was standing during the revolution. George Washington didn't sleep there, but he did dip a bucket of water from our well. I can still see them standing there, waving - Aunt Amy, Mama and Willy. Poor Willy. He didn't know I was leaving his life forever. I'll never forget the night I told them I was going to New York. They said it was a dreadful place for a vacation. I announced I was going to work there. Willy took it very well. He said he'd give me a month. Then I'd run for home, ready to settle down in Lawrenceville. I remember the day Willy pinned me. He said it meant we were engaged to be engaged. I wanted a marriage like Mom and Dad's, but not yet. First, I wanted new experiences, new faces, new surroundings. Lawrenceville would be there forever.

I told him he should see one of our New England blizzards. He took me to the Martha Washington Hotel for Women. Aunt Amy had stayed there. She said it was as safe as you could be in a city like New York. The desk clerk warned me they didn't allow men in the rooms. (chuckles) I confessed I didn't know any. Before my feet were dry, the agency sent me out on my first interview. Oh, I had butterfiies in my stomach, but I acted like I'd done it all my life. At least I thought I did. WOMAN: I knew it. She had that look. -I'm to see Miss Steinberg. -I knew she was pregnant. Well, certainly I should have kept an eye on her, Doctor, but she sneaks out. You know how she is. I haven't any idea who the father is. It could have been one of several. (sighs) All right. I'll start her on vitamins tomorrow. Queenie's pregnant again. My Siamese. Cripes, I hope it isn't that beat-up black tom with the one eye. A black Siamese should be very pretty. -I'm Anne Welles. -Oh. Oh, yes. The agency phoned about you. BA at Radcliffe. Mr. Bellamy will like that. He'll think it gives the office tone. -The agency said he's a lawyer. -A theatrical lawyer. There's a difference. He handles actors, writers and directors - important ones. He advises them and draws up their contracts with no loopholes. -Sounds fascinating. -It isn't. Would I work for Mr. Bellamy or Mr. Bellows? There is no Mr. Bellows anymore. Only his nephew Lyon Burke. You can tell when he's in the office by the girls around that watercooler. -How's your shorthand? -Weak, but I type 60 words a minute. Okay. I'll take you in to see the boss. Mr. Bellamy, this is Miss Welles. She's here about the job. -She's too good-looking. -Mr. Bellamy, that's not fair. I'll just get her broken in and some insurance salesman will marry her. -I'm already engaged. -There. See? But I'm not going to marry him. Besides, lots of secretaries are married, aren't they? Not in this office. Some days you'll have to work until midnight, having dinner with me and a prospective client. I'll drink too much and won't remember a damn word next morning. You'll have but one sherry and will remember everything. I have an excellent memory, and I love sherry. -Think you can handle it? -I'm sure I can. Could she start right away? We're swamped. Stop running my life, Steinberg. I'm still not convinced. Mr. Bellamy, couldn't you please give me a trial? All right. I'll try you out for one week, starting as of now. Here. Take these contracts over to Helen Lawson at the rehearsal hall on 44th Street. Take a cab. See that she signs them. -Iet's see if she can handle that. -I'll be right back. And, uh, don't give her that "I loved you when I was little girl" routine, or she'll stab you in the back. Helen Lawson? Mr. Bellamy, that was wicked. Harry, what the - Four bucks an hour for 80 people? Are you kidding? Oh, come on - -Excuse me. -Just a minute. Yeah? I have some contracts for Miss Lawson from Mr. Bellamy, my employer. Go down the hall to the balcony, turn left. It's the first dressing room on your right. If you're a Capricorn, watch your step. Yeah, Harry. It's a good company.

He's done it before. You, go back to the office and tell that son of a bitch to get off his butt and earn his oats. But, Miss Lawson, you haven't finished signing the contracts. And I don't intend to. Not until Bellamy ties a can to that little broad's tail. -Mr. Bellamy. -(hissing) I've thought it over, and I don't think I - -Oh. -want this job. Excuse me. You must be Mr. Burke, the one with the watercooler. -I mean - -And you must be Miss Welles. Mr. Bellamy told me all about you. Tell me, why are you dismissing us so soon? Because I think show business is cruel. You're quite right. Oh, have a seat. -People do despicable things. -Yes, they certainly do. Like firing some poor girl because a crude person like Miss Lawson resents her ability. Please, have a seat. Miss Welles, a raw recruit always dives for the nearest foxhole at the first burst of enemy fire. But don't let that happen to you. Don't you throw in the towel just yet. Um, this is a rather cruel business. It's also a great business and a rewarding business. For every Helen Lawson, there's always a Helen Hayes or a Mary Martin. Now, you think about that. Well, uh, may I have the contracts? Yes. -Well, they are signed? -Oh, um, well, one is. Oh. Yes, yes, one is. And legibly too. Oh, I almost forgot. Miss Lawson gave me a message for Mr. Bellamy. -Yes -She said - -Well, she said, "Tell that son of a -" -Gun? (chuckles) Gun. "Tell him to get off his -" Yes, I think I know that message.

Believe me, Miss O'Hara, by next week every producer in town will be after you. It gives you stature to walk out on a Helen Lawson show. Honey, don't listen to 'em.

I'd like you to meet Kevin Gillmore. -This is Neely O'Hara. And her husband. -How do you do? Congratulations. -How do you do? -We're coming to the Coast next week. -Maybe we can get together. -Great. Give me a call. I'd like to see how Gillian's hair spray reacts to smog. -Good to see you, Anne. Mr. Gillmore. -Nice to have met you. Hey, you know something? I've never carried you across the threshold before. Oh! (giggles) Thanks. I need it. -Hold that, honey. -Oop. -Did you have a hard day? -A brute. Sit down, will you? I might as well give it to you all at once. The studio dropped my option. So what? There are lots of other studios. Should have never let them put you in Westerns. You're a romantic lead. Sure. Sure. Look! You're a singer. You can always go back to nightclubs. I don't want to go back to nightclubs. Will you do me a favor? Will you just not worry about it? He doesn't want to go back to nightclubs. He wants to make pictures. I'm gonna heat up the lasagna. -TONY: Boy, could I go for a drink. -JENNIFER: Me too. ANNE: It's charming. -Would you care for cocktails? -Two martinis. -Ma'am? -Glass of red wine. -KEVIN: And I'll have a Scotch and soda. -Thank you. Pardon me, Pat. Hello, Anne. Welcome to California. -Jennifer. -Lyon. -Tony. Good to see you. -Nice to see you again, Lyon. Lyon Burke. Kevin Gillmore. -Hello. -How do you do. -Well, how long will you be in town? -JENNIFER: Not half long enough. GILLMORE: Just two days. I'm taking Anne to Hawaii. Wonderful. You'll love it. Incidentally, Anne, how did you like my book? -I haven't read it. -Oh, you should. It's dedicated to you. I'll send you a copy. Well, I hope you enjoy your stay. If there's anything I can do while you're here, please let me know. -You're too late, Lyon. We saw them first. -(laughs) -GILLMORE: Thanks just the same. -Not at all. Good-bye. JENNIFER: Well, I think I'll have a butterfly steak. -Hi, Mel. The door was open. -(typing) Jenny, how are you? Oh, it's good to see you. -It's lovely to see you. -Sit down. -Neely's at the studio. -Oh, I thought she had a few weeks off. Uh, two weeks until she starts shooting. And wardrobe fittings, makeup tests, publicity stills, you know. You don't suppose there's a part for Tony in the picture, do you? You can ask her, Jen, but I wouldn't count on it. She'll be home any minute. She's with Ted Casablanca, trying on new clothes. Only in Hollywood do women faint because some queer deigns to design their clothes. Maybe you could put in a good word for Tony. Me? She doesn't listen to me. I'm the last person to ask her. She's changed, Jen. She - She starts at 5:30 in the morning, still punchy from last night's sleeping pills. So she takes a red pill to pep herself up and at midnight she's still flying. I try to talk to her, it's like a brick wall. Well, I guess that's one of the drawbacks of being a big star. Hey, you know what these are? One month's checks she has to sign. All the dough she makes, we still had to borrow to pay the income tax. Attorneys, agents, managers, secretaries, doctor, maid, masseuse, voice coach - she sings like a bird. -Psychiatrist. -Psychiatrist? Oh, yeah. The studio wants her to find out why she's so exhausted. They say they think it must be emotional conflicts. Conflicts, my foot. There aren't enough hours in the day. The headshrinker says she's insecure, that she needs mass love. Maybe I'm lucky I don't have any talent. Hi, Jen. Mel, get me some skim milk, will you? -Want something? -I'll have a Coke. Jen, I don't know what I'm gonna do about Mel. He's changed so. He just can't seem to get with it. What do you mean, Neely? He's gotten you lots of good publicity. That was the studio. They told him to butt out. They don't even want him on the set. They say he makes me self-conscious. Ted Casablanca says he's the joke of the town. I wouldn't pay any attention to that. You know how bitchy fags can be. He's not even 30, and he's made over a million bucks. -Here we go. -Mel, hand me my bag, will you? Thank you. Well, I've lost five pounds already. These pills are really great, Jen. They kill your appetite. Only trouble is, they pep me up so much, I can't sleep. Well, what nice, fattening thing did you tell Arlene to make tonight? Arlene quit this morning. She said you yelled at her. That's three cooks in three months, Neely. She was a louse anyway. You said yourself she was taking home all the booze. Other people have loyal help. Why can't we? You don't know how to talk to 'em. That's your job. You'd better start running this house properly. I'm not the butler, Neely. You're not the breadwinner either. I'm afraid I'd better be running along. -See you soon. -Bye, Jen. That was a rotten thing to say in front of Jenny. Why? She knows the facts of life. You two sit around on your rumps all day, while Tony and I slave. Maybe I'd better get off my rump and go back to New York. -I can always get my old job back. -Suit yourself. I'm too tired to argue. I'm gonna take a shower and get back to Ted Casablanca's. You know, you're spending a lot more time than necessary with that fag. Ted Casablanca is not a fag! And I'm the dame who can prove it. Thanks for making up my mind. I should've left a long time ago. But I kept remembering the old Neely. She was quite a girl. Now you're just like all the rest of 'em - success is too big for you. If you ask me, my success is too big for you. Yeah, sure. Sure it is. I'll just take this. It's the only thing around here that belongs to me. WOMAN: ♪ When will I learn? ♪ ♪ How will I ♪ ♪ Where will I find ♪ ♪ What is real? ♪ ♪ Long for one time ♪ ♪ Long ago ♪ ♪ When my heart ♪ ♪ Knew how to feel ♪♪ I wrote about the things I knew, my own experiences. But I guess I only had one book in me. Was I really that naive? (laughs) Naive and wonderful. I missed you, Anne. Oh, I went back to the agency business, and I like it. Incidentally, Neely is one of my clients. Really. I don't know. England's changed. Or I've changed. The nightingales somehow just sounded off-key. -I used to pretend you'd gone bald and fat. -(laughs) I used to picture you with a sink full of dishes and a baby tugging at your skirt. Are you really going to marry Kevin? I was, but now I realize it's impossible. I'm glad. You know, every girl I met always washed out. Just couldn't stand up to your image. -(chattering) -♪♪ (orchestra: up-tempo) I am not taking you to a bistro. I'm taking you home to bed. -Please, darling. -As in sleep, which you need. -Miss O'Hara? -Yes. -Please, would you autograph my program? -Of course. Look, there's Neely over there with that Casablanca. -Where? -Over there. Let's try and catch up to them. -Thank you. -Oh, darling, let's get out of here. Here comes Tony Polar. He's gonna put the bite on me for a job. I could've sworn Neely saw us. Well, she's nearsighted, darling, and she can't see 10 feet in front of her. (chuckles) Yeah. Tony! Are you okay? I don't know. My legs just seemed to give way. Happened the other day on the set. We had to retake the scene. Well, I think you ought to see a doctor. No, I'm all right. Come on. -(groans) -Tony! -Jen! -Tony! Tony! (whimpers) Tony! There. He'll sleep for a while. He didn't know me. He didn't know where he was. Go out, Jen. The doctor will explain it to you. The disease is called Huntington's chorea. It's relatively rare. Unfortunately, there is no cure. The symptoms of physical and mental degeneration first appear about age 30, sometimes later. There's an increasing loss of muscular control. Chances for inheritance are extremely high, far above average. Tony's father had it. I kept hoping it wouldn't hit Tony. Now you can see why I was against his marrying. Will he be able to walk again? As soon as the sedation I gave him wears off, but... the motor disturbances will occur again, and... there will be periods of blankness and possible hallucination. It may take a year before he reaches the point of complete incapacity. Are there any further questions? No. Good night, Mrs. Polar. DOCTOR: If he becomes unmanageable, we'll keep him under sedation. He probably won't remember any of this tomorrow. Call me first thing in the morning. Good night. MIRIAM: Good night. Jen? Maybe you'll understand now why I've been the way I've been about money, for instance. I've just been putting aside every cent I could get my hands on. We'll keep him at home as long as we can. -What about you? -Tony and I had different fathers. I know how you love him. I'm not blind. I thank you. Miriam, I'm pregnant. PHOTOGRAPHER: Look this way, Miss O'Hara! PHOTOGRAPHER #2: This way, Miss O'Hara. This way, please. -What about Ted Casablanca? -Miss O'Hara has nothing to say. (all clamoring) -What about Ted Casablanca? -You heard me! No comment! Any marriage plans? MAN: What about your new film? l haven't heard about that. JENNIFER: Tonydidn'trealize where we were taking him. The next day, Miriam had arranged a meeting with a quickie European movie producer. Oh. Oh! (speaks French) Monsieur Chardot, this is my sister-in-law. Monsieur Chardot is here from Paris. He's out here looking for talent. Enchante, mademoiselle. Mademoiselle Polar has shown me your photographie. I am interested in a young lady with your, uh - your, uh - -How you say? -Measurements. The general French girl is inclined to be flat in the bosom. I see. Just what kind of pictures do you make, Mr. Chardot? -I make the art film. -Yes, I've seen a few. They're pretty raw. I mean, French subtitles over a bare bottom doesn't necessarily make it art. Evil is only in the eye of the beholder, mademoiselle. My films are shown right here in your own country. Jennifer. You've posed undraped on the stage. That was before I married Tony. It's up to you. Tony wouldn't know the difference. Well, I would! JENNIFER: I realized I had to give in, take the job. The sanitarium was very expensive. All right, Sheriff, you win. You ran my father out of town. Now you're trying to run me out of town. Well, the Dernies don't give up that easy. -Oh, it's too hot! -Cut! -Stand by. -Well, it's too hot. It's too damned hot! The cameraman's frying me. Neely. -Neely. -Shut up! -She's full of sauce. -It's not booze. It's pills. Send for her husband. Look, Neely. We've got to finish this take. Get lost. I'm through for the day. Get up off the floor. You're making a spectacle of yourself! -Zip up your dress. -NEELY: I can't! You made it too tight! CASABLANCA: It's bloat from all those pills and booze. I haven't had a drink all day. It's the heat. Nevertheless, you're going out there and complete that scene. Just how long do you think you can get away with these antics? Come on! Give this to the hairdresser. Miss O'Hara will be ready in a moment. (doorbell buzzing) -I want to see Mr. Burke. -He not in, Miss O'Hara. He's not in. He's not in. That's all I've heard at his office for three days. He's ducking me. He's giving me the treatment, just like all the others. -Where's Miss Welles? -He is in San Francisco, Neely. Tell me something, Annie. How come the boss of a big agency spends three days in San Francisco with a lousy nightclub singer? He's working overtime. Why doesn't he look after my interest? I'm the one who pays the rent on this pad. You're being obnoxious. Oh, I'm sorry. I want Lyon to talk to that director. He's crucifying me. When's he due back? I'm not sure. When a man says he won't do a lousy scene, that's called integrity. When a woman says it, she's temperamental. They say I'm difficult. They say I'm drunk even when I'm not. Sure, I take dolls. I gotta get some sleep. I gotta get up at 5:00 in the morning and "sparkle, Neely, sparkle." Neely, you know it's bad to take liquor with those pills. They work faster. Here, Anne. With that guy of yours in San Francisco, you could use a few dolls. Here. No, thanks. Suit yourself. You should make him marry you, honey. -Have you heard from Jennifer? -Yeah. She called me about six months ago. You know what she asked me? She wanted to know where she could get an abortion. An abortion. How do you like that? She was the one who wanted all the kiddies and the vine-covered cottage. Then I heard she went to Paris to make art films. (chuckles) Art films. Nudies! That's all they are. Nudies! Well, that's her problem. She doesn't care about me. Why should I care about her? -Nobody cares about me. -Neely, that's not so. Nobody cares if I live or die, just so long as I write the checks, just so long as they get their cut of the action! Neely, stop feeling sorry for yourself. You're a big star. You have everything. Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah. I'm a big star. (inhales) I am a big star. I tell myself that, Annie. But I don't feel it. I don't feel anything anymore. I haven't slept with Ted in weeks. And that psychiatrist, Dr. Mitchell. Dr. Mitchell says that I am self-destructive. So what? What do I do about it? (sobs, sniffles) Well, to hell with him. To hell with all of 'em. Who needs 'em? Let 'em say what they please. Even the bad publicity helps when you get to be as big as I am. And, boy, am I getting the bad publicity. -You've had enough of those. -Oh! -Now, try to calm down. -Ieave me alone! (sobbing) I can't even remember anymore when somebody wasn't nagging at me or pressuring me or beating me. Neely, you're upset. Why don't you lie down for a while, huh? (sniffles) No. Not alone. Not anymore. I need a man to hold me. I need Mel. (chuckles) I mean, Ted. I'm going home, Annie. I'm going home to Ted right now. Thanks for listening. I really got a lot off my chest. Ted? Honey, it's me. (woman laughing) (woman chattering, laughing) -TED: It's not cold, huh? -WOMAN: Uh- (laughing) You think she can hear us? Oh, relax, baby. By this time, she's so full of pills and booze, the San Francisco earthquake couldn't rouse her. (laughing) (woman squealing) (woman gasps) Having fun, kiddies? Don't mind me. Go right ahead. I'll watch. You'd better run, you little tramp. How dare you contaminate my pool? Here. Maybe this will disinfect it. All right, faggot. Start explaining. You need glasses, Neely. She's hardly built like a boy. I could take that better. I'm sure you could. You know, you almost made me feel I was queer. -You're crazy! -Am l? Yes, you are. You want me to fight your battles at the studio, take you to openings. As a man, you're always too tired and too full of those damned dolls. You've got guts! I catch you red-handed with a naked broad in my pool, and you sermonize me! Not a sermon, Neely, just a few cold facts. Ted, you know how hard I work. When I come home, I'm exhausted. -How can I think of sex? -Then why'd you sign the new contract? You don't have to work. I make enough money for both of us. Well, you've got your new deal, and I've got my sanity back. With that little whore? That little whore makes me feel nine feet tall. Honey, please don't. I need you. You're damn right, you do, Neely. But not as a man. You can go to hell. (shrieks) Go to hell, you bastard! WOMAN: I tried to wake her, Mr. Burke, but she just wouldn't budge. All right. Thank you. Neely. Neely! Neely, wake up. Come on, wake up! You were due on the set three hours ago. -What set? -Why didn't you show up? (chuckles) I couldn't, Lyon. I had a rotten night. I wanna tell you something, and you're not gonna like it. -Stop yelling at me. -They're replacing you in the picture. (clicks tongue) They can't do that. Well, it so happens they can. Lyon, my last picture grossed a fortune, and it hasn't even played Europe yet. But it cost more than it grossed, and the reason was you. Now, on this one, you've been out six days because of sleeping pills. You've been late on the set, and you walked out in the middle of the day. To top it all, you've been boozing and eating all through the picture! I'm still the biggest box office draw there is. Come on, Neely. Get some sense in your head. Stockholders are only interested in one thing - profits. Well, they're gonna replace you with a younger girl. -Younger? Lyon, I'm 26! -That's right. And you look 36. Look at that face. It's all puffy. Your eyes are bloodshot. Thank you very much. I'm sorry, Neely. But I can't just stand by and watch a talent like yours go down the drain. (sobbing) You're my agent. You're supposed to take care of me. I'm trying to. But you've got to cooperate with me. (sobs) What do you want me to do? I want you to go to a sanitarium... and dry out. -A sanitarium? -I'm sorry. It's the only solution. Look, honey, you have to beat this thing. You just have to beat it. (sniffles) All right. All right. If you want me to go, I'll go. Good. Now, Anne and I will come by and pick you up about 3:00. (door closes) United Airlines? (sniffles) What time is your next flight to San Francisco? Yes, one.

Lyon, what am I doing in a hospital? -You took an overdose of pills. -Oh, God. -Did it get in the papers? -Lyon told them it was accidental. Well, it was! -It was, honest. -I know. But the next time, you might not be so lucky. What am I gonna do? Anne and I want you to go to a sanitarium in Los Angeles. -A nuthouse. -ANNE: No. It's the same place that Tony is in. Anne, I'm not nutty. I am just hooked on dolls! It's not a nuthouse. They say getting off them is worse than booze or dope! Oh, Lyon, I'm scared. I've forgotten how to sleep without dolls. I can't get through a day without a doll. Please, Lyon. Don't send me there. (sobs) I need a doll! Lyon, don't leave me here! Give me a doll. Just one! (screams, sobs) Lyon! (man speaking French) (French continues) Gauche. (man speaking French continues) (French continues) (speaking French) (French) (man speaking French) (speaking French) Merci. Merci. Well, this is by far the best we've made. Fox would like to release the film in the United States. They have also offered to buy your contract. Does that mean I can go home? Well, I'm not sure I wish to sell. Oh, Claude, you'll make lots of money. (chuckles) True, but, uh, you will get half. I just want to go back to America and see Tony. What use is a man who is no longer a man, huh? A vegetable. Claude, please. Stop it! I've hated this. You can find yourself another girl. Yes, I can - young girl, a real actress. (chuckles) For what will you settle? Settle? I want my half! Then I will not sell. All right. I'll settle for a third. Anything. Just let me go home. Anything, huh? (chuckles) Well, perhaps we can make some arrangement, huh? We'll talk about it later... at, uh, the apartment. (door opens, closes) Oh, I cursed you out at first. Then I realized you did the right thing. -It was the only thing. -It wasn't easy. I couldn't sleep that night. (chuckles) You should've taken a doll. No. I'm really very grateful. -Nobody else gave a damn. -That's not true. There was a flood of letters and telegrams from all over the world. We saved them for you. Thanks. At first, it was awful. Like living in a zoo. They stuck me in this cheesy little bedroom, and this big, ugly nurse with orthopedic shoes never left my side. -I asked for a cigarette. -Give me a cigarette. Two a day during social hour. I told her I had no intention of socializing with kooks. I couldn't sleep. I needed a pill. I started screaming. I figured they'd give me something to calm me. They sure did. (angry muttering) Let go of me! Let go of me! Let go! (sobbing) They ordered me to take off my nightgown. I told them to drop dead. -They took it off for me. -No! (whimpering) Then they stuck me in this big tub and hooked a canvas around me. And this young nurse sat there and wrote down everything I said. I used words that sure aren't in medical books. Ya stupid-ass nurse! What are ya looking at? Actually, the water felt great. It kept coming in and going out. I wanted to lie back and relax, but that was what they wanted. I spotted this small hole in the canvas, and I started working at it with my big toe. Pretty soon, I got half my foot through it, then I yanked my knee up to my chest. -(canvas ripping) -Oh! Oh, God! (crying) -(alarm ringing) -The nurse sounded the alarm. In the afternoon, we had recreation hour. You never saw such a bunch of well-bred kooks. They all acted as normal as apple pie. I started playing checkers with this real cute-looking little girl. All of a sudden, she leans over and gets a half-nelson on my hair and accuses me of telling the rest of the inmates that she's a latent homosexual. (gasping) You won't believe what happened next. Once a week, we have a dance. (chuckles) It's really camp. -♪♪ (light jazz) -I knew Tony was here. He was under an assumed name, but I'd never seen him. -♪♪ (ends) -Until one night - Do you know a song called "Come Live With Me"? -Yes, I do. -Would you play it, please?

Now, for business - How would you like to do a Broadway musical for David Merrick? -You think I could? -You know you could. Merrick believes in you, and so do I. Lyon's checked with the doctors here, and they say you can do it. What about the bad publicity? It'll create sympathy. People love to forgive. Lyon, I'm really in great shape. I've changed. I've learned a lot of things. I used to work my heart out, kill myself. Not anymore. There are things I want, Lyon, and I'm gonna get 'em. You know something, Annie? One of the first things I'd like to have is this fellow of yours. -You'd better watch out. -(chuckles) How soon could I see him? Jennifer, why don't you remember him as he was? I want to see him, Miriam. All right. I've booked you into a hotel near the studio. And why did you write me for an appointment with the doctor? He's already told you everything he knows. It's not about Tony. It's for me. It must have been a shock when you discovered it. Lots of lumps mean nothing. Some are only cysts, aren't they? Yes. But this one wasn't. The doctor took a biopsy, and it was malignant. Oh, Jen, I'm sorry. It's pretty hard to take. Tomorrow they have to perform a mastectomy. Doctor says it's not the end of the world. He says lots of women live long and happy lives after successful breast surgery. -Point is to catch it in time. -I'm sure they will, Jen. Afterwards, you can come to the beach with us and recuperate. I'd love to. You know? It's funny. All I've ever had was a body, and now I won't even have that. Oh, Jen, now, stop talking like that. How am I gonna keep Tony in the sanitarium? When I saw him, he didn't even know me. Well, Lyon will find you a job. I know he will. Anne, honey, let's face it. All I know how to do is take off my clothes. -(phone ringing) -Jen - Hello? Yes, I placed a call to Milwaukee. Anne, I'm all right. Really, I am. Run along. I'll stay with you tomorrow. And don't you worry. -Bye. -Bye. Hello. Mother? I had to talk to you. There's something I have to tell you. I'm sorry Mrs. Gottlieb was shocked at my pictures. No, I won't be undressing in public anymore. What did I have to tell you? Nothing. JENNIFER: Hello, Mother. Well, I just got in. I thought it was too late to call you. But I just sent you $50 last week, Mother. Okay, I'll send you $50 as soon as I get my paycheck. Tony! -Jen! -Tony! Tony. Tony!

MAN: What are your plans for films, Neely? Oh, that depends on Lyon Burke. I said, that depends on Lyon Burke. He's the man who takes care of all my affairs. -Any truth to the rumor about you two? -MAN: Any marriage plans? Well, we're both available. Good evening, Miss Lawson. -Can I help you? -No, thank you. Who you hiding from, Helen? The notices couldn't have been that bad. -The show just needs a little doctoring. -Don't worry, sweetheart. If it flops, I can always get you a job as understudy for my grandmother. Thanks. I've already turned down the part you're playing. Bull! Merrick's not that crazy. You should know, honey. You just came out of the nuthouse. It was not a nuthouse! Look, they drummed you right out of Hollywood, so you come crawling back to Broadway. Well, Broadway doesn't go for booze and dope. Now, you get out of my way, 'cause I've got a man waiting for me. That's a switch from the fags you're usually stuck with. At least I never married one. -You take that back, you old fag hag! -Get your hands off me! (gasps) -Oh, my God. It's a wig! -Give me back my hairpiece. -Her hair's as phony as she is! -Give me that. -Dig me as a redhead! -Give me that, damn you! -What the hell are you doing in there? -Giving it a shampoo. Good-bye, pussycat. -(meows) -(toilet flushes) God, she's throwing it in the can. I'll kill her! How do you like that? lt won't even go down the john. Give me that wig! (kicking stall) Okay. You want it back? Here it comes, special delivery. So long, granny. I'll tell your boyfriend not to wait. -How do I get out of here? -(door closes) Well, you can go through the kitchen. It's right next door. I'm sorry, Miss Lawson. What an awful thing to do to a great star like you. I'll go out the way I came in. I don't want to hear another word about quitting. When the going gets rough, they all talk about retirement. Not me. I've had it rough before. I'm a barracuda. I don't need pills like Neely. Sure, I know you dried her out, but it won't last. Neely hasn't got that hard core like me. She never learned to roll with the punches. And believe me, in this business, they come left, right and below the belt. Neely has no class, no real down-to-the-gut class. But she's talented, Henry. She's really got it. I knew that when I kicked her out of my show. She'd never believe it, but I'm sorry for her. Nothing can destroy her talent. But she'll destroy herself. And you, Lyon - you'd better watch it. Oh, sure. Everything's rosy now. You skip from one thing to another, one dame to another. But watch it, my friend. Find yourself a good girl, have kids, or one day you'll wind up alone like me and wonder what the hell happened. Mmm.

I will not let that girl steal the show. She almost walked off with it at dress rehearsal. It's just too late. It can't be done. Oh, Lyon, she hasn't got a run-of-the-play contract. She can be fired right now. I want her out. Oh, boy, the old star sickness begins to appear. No more gratitude. Just power. Well, I'm not gonna do it, Neely. You don't fool me. You're scared! You just wanna stay in good with Merrick. I should've known this was gonna happen. Anne tried to warn me. What the hell does Anne know? I didn't have dough handed to me because of my good cheekbones. I had to work for it. She's gone through life on a pass because of her damn classy looks. I wanna tell you something. Everyone gets paid back. Do you hear? Everyone! I'm not everyone. I don't have to live by stinking rules set down for ordinary people! I licked pills, booze and the funny farm. I don't need anybody or anything. Well, that's good, because I'm leaving. Who needs you? I'm sick of you. You're just an agent. And you're just a Helen Lawson. And not even that, because she's a professional. They love Helen Lawson, and they love Neely O'Hara! ♪♪ (orchestra: intro) Come on, guys! Move it, move it! Let's go. Come on, girls. Come on, girls. Where's Miss O'Hara? She's in her dressing room. I'll get her. Come on. Move it down. Move it down. Curtain time, Miss O'Hara. -Miss O'Hara? -Well, where is she? She won't open up the door. Neely? Neely, open the door. You're on. Neely! Hi! My God, you've got on your costume for the second act. So? I'll do the second act first. Quick, call Mr. Merrick. Get the understudy. I'm ready, Mr. Hamilton. You get lost, sister. I'm fine. I am just dandy! You let go of me, you big jerk! It's getting late. I think we ought to go. The understudy was great, especially in the dream sequence. -BARTENDER: Thank you. -I wonder what happened to Neely O'Hara. -MAN: Are you kidding? -WOMAN: They said she had laryngitis. -(man chuckles) -Who had laryngitis? -MAN: Anyway, that new girl was terrific. -MAN #2: She sure was. WOMAN: It was a lovely evening nevertheless. My beautiful little dolls. Just one... and one more. We're closing now, Miss O'Hara. All right, Edward. All right. Here. Keep the change, huh? Shall I call you a cab? I don't need it. I don't need anybody. 'Cause I got talent, Edward. Big talent. They love me. Hey! Where is everybody? Hey, everybody, where are you? Where are you? Gone. Everybody's gone. To hell with them. Who needs 'em? The whole world loves me! Where are you? Lyon? Anne. Jennifer. (screams) Ted! (cries) Mel. Oh, God. God. God? (cries) Oh, Neely. Neely O'Hara! (sobbing) Oh, Neely. Neely! Neely. Neely. -(sobbing continues) -(bell tolling) (bell continues tolling) So many years, I - I prayed for this moment. Now that it's come, I don't feel a thing. Does that mean you won't marry me? It wouldn't work, Lyon. Isn't there anything I can do to change your mind? No, Lyon. Not now. Anne - Perhaps someday, Lyon. I don't know.
