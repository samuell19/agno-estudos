Oh, I'm exhausted. Wake up, we've arrived. Damn the cars and traffic. You need a helicopter. Maria! Maria's not here, as usual, who knows who she's gone off with. - At least let's hope it's with her man. - Are you coming? Of course. It's filthy and all upside down, tomorrow you'll fix it. Of course, who else but me? We'd have been here long ago if you'd not stopped to eat. I have to eat at dinner time. But you're more spiritual, right? And spiritually you made yourself a steak that looked like four! Keep calm! Don't move, keep calm, if not... I cut the kid's throat like a turkey. - No! - Stay calm... for the child's sake. Look, don't take it out on my son. It'll get you nowhere. What do you want? - Hand over your money! - We have nothing here, no cash. Nothing else, nothing. Just this. Take it. Stop! Give the money to the little girl. Here, give it to him, he won't do anything to you. Let me go! The rings. Take them... You know, I like you, man. And I like that you call me "man". I don't know your name. Well if you don't want to tell me, it's all the same. When you're lucky enough to meet a woman like you you must never think that maybe she's just a one night fling. It doesn't matter who we are, but that we are a woman and a man and that tonight... - Who is it? - Johnny... What are you doing here? What is it? What happened? That one said they'd be back tomorrow. I escaped by a miracle! Bastards, you just made fun of me and got me into trouble too, That's why you didn't tell me your name. Bloody hell! Be a good girl... and shut up! Clear off! You'll say: I killed in self-defence First Surrender Michel, look at that villa. It must be uninhabited. Brake, come on, brake! Jump off, go see. Come in! There's no one, come on! Come on... come on. - Take a look around. - What are you afraid of? There's no one here, I guarantee you. You have to trust me in these things. I sense if there's any danger, I have a kind of radar. Yeah, some kind of radar. Like cats. One job here and we're settled for ages. Yeah, like tonight's job. What does it matter, this is one of the most elegant parts of the city, rich people. Yes, sure... Let me light it. Wait... here. This is the right time, we take a nice haul and go. With the bike in two days we're in San Pedro. And with the money... coke! Lots of drugs and... free! What do you mean? What does "free" mean? It seems clear to me. Let's study the job well this time, in every detail. We do this job and then each of us can... I do the work! What do you do? Go around with the bike, take drugs, dance. A different woman every night. I always take the risk. You have a good time and I'm the one risking my neck every time. Stop it, always the same complaint! Let's think about what we have to do instead. Handsome. - Don't call me "Handsome" - Fine, fine. I've already looked around and maybe I found it. Have a good look. if there is an isolated and quiet villa in the world, this is it. Look, it's completely surrounded by trees and there'll be no servants. From here we can check it day and night. Bruno, I'll be with you in a moment. Did you say something, Bruno? Bruno, honey... Bruno... were you tired? 327 825? It's 6.30. The alarm call? Many thanks. Awake already, dear? Didn't you sleep well? No, not much. Good morning, darling. Good morning. What a woman.... Damn what luck... He's leaving. Him alone? Sure, don't you see? He leaves alone, she doesn't. How do you know? Because a woman like that doesn't leave with just one suitcase. She'll accompany him to the airport. It's okay for us, isn't it? What's wrong with you Johnny, something wrong? No, no. I just like that woman, she's a grown woman, a real woman. Too bad this trip was so sudden, or you could have come along too. Well yes, if we'd known... But there'll be other occasions. I may be away for up to ten days to conclude this contract. As I told you, it's very important. You realize? I'm replacing the sales manager. It's a new item, if I get the exclusive it'll be a big deal for a junior partner. You'll succeed, dear. I have a lot, I have a lot of faith in you, I always have, you know. Thank you. I must say that today I have no desire to go to Rome. Everything was organized so quickly. Forecasts, sales, estimates, costs... market research. I'm sorry to see you go so unwillingly. I just don't feel like leaving you alone. It'll only be for a few days. Quite right. But I don't want you to be alone in the house. Try to go out with some friends, to dinner, the theatre, the cinema. Try to have fun. Why are you laughing? You reminded me of the things my father used to say to my mother every time he set out on a trip. And what did he say? Well, a lot... a lot of nonsense. No, this time no. I really want to see what you'd do. I like that woman. This time I don't want any of your games or fancy tricks, you better remember. Listen: I'm only interested in the money to go to San Pedro and nothing else. Think about her too, you conquer her, take her and I'll do the rest of the work. With a woman like her it's not easy to get into her house. talking, courting her and... Nothing else? Let's say you work it out a little and then... and then mind, you leave her to me. But any tricks you won't get away with it, understand? And then we'll go to San Pedro, you fill yourself with drugs as much as you want, it's no longer my business. Ah, your great love is back. See how right I was? I know how these people live. travel dress... eight suitcases... hatbox, furs... Good, good, good. And now she's here with us, all alone. Who knows why she's so sad. Do you know what I think, Johnny? What do you think? How should I know what you think, with that brain of yours? I think it's done, trust me. Trust me, Johnny. Good morning, ma'am. Excuse me, maybe it's too early. Good morning, yes? I seriously hope I haven't bothered you too much. Don't worry, what is it? I'm part of a group of agronomy students specializing in gardening. Keeping a private gardener these days is very expensive, each of us can offer a better and cheaper job. If you're interested I could come and fix the garden for you, even tomorrow, and we can talk about conditions and price. I'm sorry, my husband isn't here, he's gone. Well, all the better, I mean... if you like you can let him find a completely transformed garden when he returns. What do you think? No, I prefer to talk to him about it. He won't be back tomorrow, I think I'll call my husband tonight. Sure, that's fine. - See you tomorrow morning then. - Alright, see you tomorrow morning. Good morning Mrs. Martin. - Good morning, Tony. And your husband? He left today for Rome, he'll stay for a few days. Take his passport away. What can I get you? The shrimps are very fresh. Yes, shrimp cocktail, but not too much. - Very well. And for later? - I don't know. What do you recommend? We have an extraordinary "patè a la maison". Well, go for the pate. Love is conceived by these young people only as an instinctive form therefore simple, without complexes. Unlike us who are tempted to reject this way of being, without even delving into the reasons and circumstances that lead them to such disturbing performances. It is certainly not easy to judge. Psychologists and sociologists attempted to explain the causes of this thrust of young people towards the essential values ​​of the human condition. Values ​​that obviously have been and always will be the foundation of our society, even if at times one is led to believe a certain violence in the performances... Bruno... Bruno... Yes, Miss. Hello, Miss? What's going on? Hello. Miss, Miss please... no, I'm not speaking! Anna? Anna is that you? How are you? - Who are you talking to? - Sure... Ah, the little wife... Well, I had a bad day today, Bruno. I felt so lonely and so I popped into the office. I regret not coming to Rome with you and I thought I'd join you. No, now that I've talked to you, I'm much calmer. I miss you so much you know. When you're not here I feel so useless, you are my whole life. Yes, it happens to me too. When I'm far away I realize how important you are, Anna, and how much I owe you. Think how much I'd have liked you to have taken the plane and come to Rome. Yes, of course, of course you do. Am I bothering you? May I come in? - Is there someone there with you? - Where? I'm in my room... Please, tell me the truth, Bruno. OK I confess: I'm not alone, the Kessler twins are with me. Both, I don't know which to choose, I can't make up my mind, Oh, Bruno honey, what do the Kesslers have that I don't. Nothing, just the novelty, a whim. Love, come back soon, come back as soon as you can. Of course. Just give me time to close this deal. The company is your money. It's not my money anymore, it's yours. Goodbye, goodbye, my love, my great love. - Bruno! Are you still there? - Of course, darling. I'm so on edge. This morning a gardener showed up to work on probation for a few days. He's part of a group of students who do it for passion, cheaply. Yes, they are students in agronomy, specializing in gardening. Look, if you agree, I'll have the garden fixed while you're away, what about it? Sure! If it pleases you, - to take your mind off things and have some company - OK, love. Fine. Remember I'm waiting for you. Goodnight, my love. I miss you so much you know? Goodbye. Let's see: flowers, corolla. Here are these. Chrysanthemums. Chrysanthemums that lose their petals should be treated with a 17% solution. - And dahlias? - Ah yes, dahlias. Dahlias absorb water better, so to make them last longer you must cut the stem. I'm doing pretty well, I guess. But what's the use. Don't be an idiot: it's clear what it's for. Yes, I understand, but it's all a waste of time. Know what we'll do instead? - We ring the door and enter. - Oh yeah? - Yeah! Then while I'm in the room with her, you think about the rest of the work. After, we get on our bike and go. To San Pedro, where you get all the coke you want, what do you think? But think for a moment: if this time we aren't careful, the police will find us right away, don't you realize? They'll already be looking for us, this time it must be perfect! And what do we know? We don't even know where their valuables are hidden. What's wrong with you, Michel? What are we becoming, two gentlemen thieves? Do we ask Arsene Lupin for lessons in theft? Look at this nut. That cat never stops. I'll go see. John? Here, this is a treat for you. What technique man, why don't you use it with women? Don't let it get away. Come here, beautiful, come here. - Don't be afraid. - It's mine, give it to me. Nice kitty, come here... Good, don't move. No, I was just about to get it. Leave it, it's mine, it's mine. I got it. Give it me. Who is it? Good morning ma'am, it's me. One moment. Excuse me, I'm afraid I'm too early. - Were you still asleep? - No, for heaven's sake. I've been awake for ages. - Did you talk to her husband about it? - Yes, and he agrees. Come in. Thank you. Look at state of these leaves, they're crawling with parasites. The best remedy would be to prune, though we could try copper sulphate, do you have a pump? I think so, it should be in the garage but I'm afraid it won't work. By the way: what's your name? - Michel, Mrs Martin. - I'm Anna. "Mrs. Martin" is so formal. Alright, thank you. Hey, d'you want the paper? Yes, thank you. How is it? I'm using it, it works well. You can see it's not been used much. Hardly ever. Unfortunately, the garden has always been neglected. Girl mugged and beaten in woods - But... do you have any idea what time it is? - Well, no... - It's past three. - So late? How time flies. Where do you usually eat? Generally, when I'm working, at the first bar that's handy but... now it's not worth it. I'll eat double tonight. - How about a sandwich and a beer? - I wouldn't want to bother you, but... yes, a beer would be really nice. - I'll get it for you. - Yes, thanks. Wait for me there. Where did you say you came from? From the south, a kind of desert, "the devil's pastures". How strange... why, coming from a place like that, dedicate yourself to gardening? Why... because in the middle of that steppe there is a farm. With cows, horses, sheep, and a wonderful, huge garden. And with so many types of plants and flowers, a paradise. - That's where I learned to love nature. - And how did you leave all that to come to a sea of concrete like our city? Because my father has a certain personality. I want to get by on my own. These roses are left with only the scent. But with a few drops of chlorophyll they'll regain their original colour. My mother used to say that flowers are like people: they breathe, feel and suffer. Therefore we must love them. - Who can it be? - Nothing, I think it's my friend who came to get me. I'll go. I'll be right back. Then I'm off. You seem a little pale, has something happened? No, it's nothing. - If you want, I can stay a while. - No thanks, it's over, go on. Fine. See you tomorrow. Yes, tomorrow, Michel. - Hello? - Anna? - Can you hear me fine? - Of course. What happened? I've been calling for half an hour. I went to bed and forgot to transfer the line. - Were you already asleep? - No, I was enchanted by the roses. What roses? I don't understand. - The gardener came today. - The gardener? What's that? Yes. I told you about it yesterday, remember? He taught me a wonderful way to keep flowers longer and revive their colours. - He's a lovely boy. - OK, sorry if I bothered you. Bruno, are you angry if I don't live by the phone waiting for your call? - It amuses me. - Not me, Anna. I wanted to tell you things are pretty good and maybe I can shorten the trip. Are you happy? I should answer "no", but I'm sincere and I shall say yes. - Hurry home, love. - I'll call you tomorrow. Remember Bruno, I'm waiting... and I love you. Me too, Anna. Really, honey? Good night. - Want to dance? - Yes, sure. - Wake up, you. - Shall we dance too? - Let's go. - Oh, good. - Let's go. - But why? Let's leave. I've had enough. Nice people... Bye! I get it, you're in love with her. Just try to deny it! Don't you care what this is? Not me, I only care about having that woman. You don't care that your details are in all the newspapers, do you? I don't know why I stay with you. It's like you're looking for trouble. Of course I'm pretty irresponsible myself to listen to you. Stop it. D'you know what the truth is? It's just that you're not used to dealing with women of that class. Today she changed her dress twice, she made you coffee and looked at you like a cat. Oh, you're really crazy, "handsome". Don't call me "handsome". I already warned you. Know what I think? You're try to drag things out while waiting for her husband to arrive. I'm just trying to do things right and nothing else. That's to say you want to take the money and jewels, get away and spend it in San Pedro. And I will. I'm not a wretch like you losing his head over some old cougar. Take back what you said. Calm down, Johnny. You've been with her. You'll pay for this. I haven't, cut it out! Cut it out! Come on, swear! Swear! I want your word! You really haven't been with her? Answer! - No, I won't even think about it. - I want to believe you. You listen, Johnny, leave it to me. - And you'll see you won't regret it. - I warn you, I'll give you just 24 hours to do it your way. If you can't, I will, but in my own way! Good morning, Michel. The gate's already open. Do you know that your rose treatment turned out to be perfect? Last night they were beautiful, fragrant. Yes Michel, really. They were so beautiful they didn't even seem cut. Thank you. - What are you doing? - I'm burying the violet. Burying? It's our way of saying: I'm sowing. Some words scare me, there are things I'd never want to think about. I'll put these roses in water right away, it's too hot out here. What do you think? Do you really like them? It's a sweet omelette, they did them at boarding school on holidays. It's the thing I remember best. It's become the dish of my happy days. To tell the truth, at college I was always very happy. All the other girls cried when school started. On the contrary, I felt that I was having the happiest time of my entire life. And it was intoxicating to enjoy that happiness moment by moment, completely. Believing that life was a succession of splendid colourful images, so sweet. Oh, excuse me. I chatted so much I fell asleep without realizing. It's been so long since I talked about my childhood. Sometimes memories are so beautiful they frighten one. International? Rome, please. Hotel Saint Maurice. - Your number. - 327 825. Yes ma'am, Hotel Saint Maurice. Mr. Martin. He'll be back around 6 pm. Wait, I'll put his wife on. Yes? Who's talking? Switchboard, they want Mr. Martin. - Mr. Martin's room? - Yes, who is it? - Is this Mrs Martin? - Yes, can I help? Tell him that... that his wife called... Tell him that... that his wife called... Tell him that... that his wife called. Damn the money! Yet I knew it, I've known it for ages. He doesn't love me, he doesn't want me... it was always only my money. But... if he doesn't love me, how could he be near me? Live with me in this house? I had to believe him, one must always believe in something, in someone. And through all these years, these long, sweet years, is it possible that nothing was born? Why, why? Has nothing taken root? But something yes. My God, maybe something, yes. There is always the right time for things... maybe ours, maybe ours is coming now. Anna. I couldn't help but... Go away. Leave me alone... please! It seems impossible that you were so naive. Are you suggesting I did it on purpose? Didn't you know I'm a wicked home wrecker? Stop it, this is no time for joking. Now I have to warn the boy. He studied everything so well. Miss? Please, international, now. Of course, miss, I'm waiting, but it's urgent. Damn you, maybe you screwed it all up. It won't be easy to find the boy at this hour. I prefer to stay, I couldn't leave you alone. Thank you. Michel, it happened that by chance I found out my husband is cheating on me. It's hard to know that a marriage is over. Maybe it's just a stupid adventure. And won't compromise a marriage. It won't compromise it, no... it'll destroy it! A union when love has gone... is nothing. Do you think your husband is in love with this woman? If he wasn't in love with her it would be even more useless, more ignoble, don't you think? You are extraordinary, Anna. But you really don't believe that a person can be with another if they are not in love with them? Blessed are those who stay loyal. I'd like to tell you something, Anna: perhaps your husband will lose you, but he will not be able to forget you. You are very important in a man's life. Thank you, Michel... Thank you. Anna, I'd like to ask you a favour: it's very late and my friend couldn't come and get me. If you could take me into town... It would relax you. And then you'd get some fresh air. What do you think, Anna? Maybe you're right. Yes, I'll gladly accompany you. Just wait a moment. What are you doing here? Trying not to get fooled by you. What are you waiting for? The money is in her room. I convinced her to drive me into town. It's simple: I'll try to get her drunk. And while I keep her out for a couple of hours, you prepare everything as it was planned, OK? And don't make any noise! You listen, there's something I just don't like. If you try to cheat me... watch out. You're done for! Go now, Johnny, she's coming. - I'll get the car, wait for me in front of the garage - Yes, sure. What? The number I called doesn't answer? OK, miss, thank you. Try again later, you're worrying too much. Maybe, but I have to be able to warn him. - Why, what's changed? - I'd say everything. The boy didn't just have to woo my wife. I know, he had to do more and give you proof of your wife's betrayal. To take to court. He had to do a lot more, Sandy, a lot more. What? Isn't being able to separate from her enough? Separating myself from her money too? I really don't see why when you can do better. The guy I found is capable of anything: he can woo a woman and can even kill her if you ask him. But... it's not true, you're making it all up. You're scaring me and even if it were true, I don't want any part of it. Of course, it's my affair. I'll see to it myself. Come on, pack the cases, we're going home. You are! I left to stay eight days in Rome and eight days I stay. You came with me and you'll come back too. Don't think you can decide my life now. Come on, what would you like to do? Stay here like those little bitches last night at the club? Listen up: it's not me, you have to decide what you want. We've been together more than 6 months and I've had many beautiful promises, lots of fine talk but nothing else, or am I wrong? I won't make a tragedy of it, Bruno, but right now I'm beginning to get scared. I don't want to know, got it? Do what you want but leave me out of it, understood? Fine, right, but why do you think I did it? It doesn't end like that, you'll see. Who knows what you'll do, I'm really curious. Miss? Prepare my bill and send the porter up please. Four dollars with the wrapping. It's for you. Thank you. - Which way do you have to go? - Wherever you want. I'm with you, I don't feel like leaving you alone. You're very sweet, Michel. OK, but where do we go? You decide. Well, let's see... let's go to a club. Let's look for one where you've never been. What would you like? Two whiskeys. Here, now you're like a chrysanthemum, a little sad and thoughtful but always very sensitive. Instead when you told me about school you were a lily of the valley, delicate, fragrant, smiling. Waiter? Two more whiskeys please. Oh no, not for me. I'm not used to it. I've already drunk enough and it's having an effect. Believe me, not really... Why not? This is a special night. Lovely music. Do you feel like dancing? No. Michel, I'd like... I'm not up to it. I'm... sadder than before. Let's dance. Come. No, Michel. Not here, let's go down. Hey, Michel. - Where are you going? - I'll be right back. Wait, just a minute. Taxi! Michel. - Get off me! - Shut up, you fool! He wanted to kill you, it's agreed with your husband! I heard the phone calls he made in Italy. He thought he was fooling me, but instead it's me fooling him. - And your husband too! - No, what are you saying! I love you, I want to be with you. I love you, you understand, I love you! Stop! I love you! Get off me... Stop it, I said. Why, Michel, why? You betrayed me too, Michel. I'm not Michel. It's me, look at me! I'm the only one who doesn't want your money. Michel... what harm have I done you, that you... The only one, only me... Me! Michel? You and my husband, you and him... - You... - Anna, that's not true. Let me explain, he would have killed me if... No Anna... No! Anna. Anna, how are you feeling? What happened? Answer me! I called you today, I knew you were cheating on me. I thought I'd die. Michel... was so sweet... You can't let the flowers die, he said, a garden must be cared for every day. Michel's eyes were so good, he understood me. We talked, had a drink. A union without love. What do you want it to be, Bruno? Less than nothing. I told Michel, but he didn't understand. He wasn't alone, there was another, a kind of repulsive animal. They'd come to an agreement. Maybe him... not him. He didn't lie to me, but he took me by force. I didn't think that one could suffer so much. And it's your fault, Bruno, your fault. I don't know, I don't know how it happened. But I killed him... deliberately and with malice. And I killed Michel too! It happened like this. Now Anna, listen to me well. You will give the police a slightly different version of events. You were alone at home and they entered to steal. Yes of course, they entered and I was calling you... and your wife answered, your wife! What are you saying, are you crazy? Come on darling, what happened to you tonight is awful but brace yourself. Now I'm here. Anna, you have to defend yourself! Repeat. What will you tell the police? I was alone in the house, they entered to steal the money, they want nothing more from me. Anna, don't be so silly. Repeat it, once more! I was alone in the house, two men entered to steal. And while one was stealing the other was trying to use violence against me. And to defend myself I killed him, then I shot the other one too. In self-defence. Come on, Anna repeat it. Repeat it! Sure. They both entered, but one wasn't to steal: he had to kill me. He was paid to kill me, paid by you, Bruno. Paid by you! And I'll have to tell the police. I'll have to tell, Bruno. I'll tell, I'll tell the police. I'll tell. I'll tell. Subtitles: corvusalbus
