(old school dance music) - [Voiceover] Some believe that we're solely responsible for our choices and that we have to accept the consequences of every thought, word, and deed. Others believe that it is all out of our control. Whether it's a God, superstition, or plain, simple luck. What I can assure you is that when that bell rings for the final time, you'll be sent out into the world. No more waking up at 6am to catch the bus. No more lunches with friends. You'll be sent out to prove something to that world. And more importantly, yourselves. Denial. In many cases, one who has been through a tragic event or situation in life will find ways to push that event, that memory, that moment of thought, that feeling, far away. (woman groaning) - Dudes. She's fucking tight! (chuckles) Where is it? - Captain has it. (laughing) Arr! Shiver me timbers! Woah. (mumbles) - So why are you living in a motel? - Fuck it, man. (laughing) - Dude, I'm sorry, but your mom is hot. (chuckles) I'm just kidding. - [Voiceover] Interactions are usually drastic and harmful. Anything to take them away from reality. They're running away from the problem, the cause, not confronting it. (loud whirring) (low, electric music) (car engine hums, brakes screech) - Where are my keys? Where are my keys, you fucker? (thuds, groans) - [Voiceover] Anger, the &quot;why me&quot; syndrome. We all experience it. It's nothing to be ashamed of. (woman screams) For example, the divorce of a spouse, the death of a loved one, the feelings of guilt. Blaming oneself for events over which we have no control. These are all very common feelings and emotions. (sobbing) I love my baby, I love my baby. (whimpers) I can't do it. I can't do it. (busy background noise) (vintage cash register chimes) (seagulls squawking) - [Voiceover] Bargaining, (man groans) doing desperate things, going to extremes. One who's mindset is blurred, cloudy, irrational. Doing things that are, from the stable person's point of view, absurd. (camera shutter clicks) - [Voiceover] During lunch, Ralph showed him some pornographic pictures. Jimmy knew he shouldn't be interested, but well, he was curious. What Jimmy didn't know was that Ralph was sick. A sickness that was not visible like smallpox, but no less dangerous and contagious. A sickness of the mind. You see, Ralph was a homosexual; a person who demands an intimate relationship with members of their own sex. - Look, it's a fag-mobile, boys! I bet there's some queers in there! - Alright! (laughs) - Show 'em your ass, Anus. (guys jeering) I bet you like that! You guys like that ass? Like to eat that shit wouldn't you? Disgusting motherfuckers. I'm talking to you, pussies! Yeah, look at this nigger faggot. You like his ass? You been doing that last night? Oh, I bet that finger's fucking dirty. That's fucking gross, man. AIDS and shit. Man, look at that flowery fucking shirt. Is that your fucking mama's? Have fun sucking cock, boys. - [Voiceover] Not able to operate. The sadness is too overwhelming. Keeping feelings hidden within. Feelings of wretchedness, which could provoke frequent thoughts of death; suicide. (camera shutter clicks) - [Voiceover] Turn left. - Tell me, why did you do it? Did you think you could get away with it? (crying) - I don't know! - [Detective] You think you're a big girl now, huh? You're going to big girl prison, are you ready for it? (clicking) - [Voiceover] Acceptance. Coming to terms with one situation, not necessarily being happy with it, but to accept it. But accepting it on your own terms, no one else's. The most organic interpretation of oneself. (sobbing) It might sound as if I am preaching, or delivering a sermon. That's because I am. Sometimes shit happens. This shit needs to happen. If it didn't, we wouldn't evolve as individuals. As your counselor... And as one who's been through all these steps for many different reasons, I can assure you... The real world does have its pleasant moments. It does. You just have to know when you're living them. (click) (echoing musical beat) (80's music) - [Voiceover] You're coming, right? You're not gonna stand me up again? You're gonna leave that room? - Yeah, I'm coming. (woman on phone sighs) - [Voiceover] It's so sad that this is the last night before they tear it down. We had so many mega times there. - I love you. - [Voiceover] Love you too, Jackie bear. (click, dial tone) - [Woman] Can I ask you something? - [Jack] Yeah, you can. - The other night under the pier... - Yeah? (crickets chirping) - It didn't seem like you were digging it. It didn't seem like you wanted to do it. - I was nervous. - But it's been, like, a year, and you didn't eve- - Look, I do want you, Cricket. - But? It didn't get hard, and I just felt like I was lame, or there was something wrong with me, like, like I wasn't attractive enough or something. I know that I've gotten a little fatter and I know that you don't like fat. - There's nothing wrong with you. Okay, please don't think that. I don't know, the other night I... I just wasn't feeling good, that's all. Now don't think anything of it. Ever feel that if you vanished tomorrow, nothing would change? I don't know, I just... I have this fire in me to do something. You know? Be somebody important. Make a statement. I want a reason, you know? Just existing isn't enough. And I uh... have these fucked feelings. You know, these thoughts that help me fall asleep. And I'm embarrassed talking about them, but I feel comfortable with you, you know? - I feel comfortable with you too. - Um... I think of different ways of killing myself, and how to make sure I do it right. You know, so I don't end up fucking it up and being a ditz. It'd be so embarrassing if my bro and Ma knew that I fucked it up. I think of hanging myself or something. And then I think of all the different ways, in case the rope breaks. All the different things that could still help me... In the act. You know, like getting a gun and killing myself. In case the rope breaks, or uh... Having something underneath me so that if the rope breaks I fall on it or something. Just... I have these thoughts come for me and help me fall asleep. I don't know why, since they're so fucked. I'd never kill myself. I just... They're just thoughts that comfort me. I don't know, sometimes I just... (sighs) I want a new life. - Jack... You're 18. - And? - You shouldn't feel like you need approval from a bunch of hoods. You don't even realize how special you really are. Do you want head? - Uh... Yeah, sure. I'm sorry. - You can talk to me about anything, you know. I love you for who you are. Not what you think you should be. - [Man] Do you love me? If you love me so much, why did you let it happen, huh? If you love me so much why did you let it happen? Because you're weak, Mary. You're a weak fucking person. You sat there and you did nothing. Why do you think Jack is the way he is, huh? What about fucking Twinkie? You didn't do shit! You're a failure in everything you've ever fucking done! One big, fat, fucking failure! (music grows louder) (heavy breathing) (grunts) - Come on Jack! What the fuck are you doing, man? Are you busting your own nut? Let's fucking go! Jesus. - Dude, your bro is weird. - Caught him yanking his cord this morning. - Get real! (laughing) There always has to be a fat one. - What? - It makes the hot, insecure anorexic chicks in the flock feel better about themselves. Listen, we can make tonight one for the books. Seriously, this is it. We need a night that we'll be talking about for decades. - I thought you said skating was for sissies? - The place is gay, but I still have feelings. I'm human. Besides, I don't skate. I hang. (scoffs) Speaking of gay, I've never seen you wig out before. - [Elliot] Don't call me a queer, faggot! It's not like you're gonna boink her tonight or anything. (80's music) - You said you were gonna tell Cricket a month ago. What am I supposed to do? Just fucking sit around and wait? NYC is calling my ass, and I'm jetting in two months. I'm gone! You know how I feel about you. It's just, we're different. Doesn't mean we still can't be friends. - I tried telling her, okay? I've tried telling her, I'm just... I'm fucking afraid. - Of what? - Of hurting her. She's a good person. She's a great person, and I do love her, it's just... I don't know. Every time I try telling her, I... Chicken. - Maybe she won't take it that bad. (loud 80's dance music) And I think my bro knows. - See, man? This is what I'm talking about. That you have this whole hangup about what your brother thinks? The prick graduated a year ago, and what the hell has he done with his life? - You don't understand, okay? Even though he sucks balls, we still had to deal with the same shit growing up. There's a connection there. - Your bro don't own your ass! You think I give what people think about me? - It's different for you! People want to suck your dick. Have you seen yourself out there? You're a fucking star. (loud 80's dance music) - You're good at shit. - Like what? And something that people care about, not that I get an A in algebra. - Like karate. - Yeah. I only go cause my bro goes. - Okay, magic. You're a diamond, dude. The chaca diamond. - Please don't go. I know that's a fucked up thing to ask. Please. - You're asking me to put my life on hold. Because you want to hide. I'm not going to stay 18 forever. - What's your name? - Sue. - Does your family usually leave you alone like this? That's chill. Did you paint those designs? - Yeah. - You're talented. You dig this place? - No. - No? Why not? - Too many people. - Harold Beaver. - That poor dude. - Biggest loser of all losers at school. Even a bigger loser than you, Peeve. - Is that the freak with tourettes syndrome? - Or the cunt that wears all that Kiss makeup? (laughing) - Shit! Ass! - Fuck, Steve. - I mean, it's a little funny, but it's kinda messed up. - What the fuck is the matter with you, dude? - So you're the one that paid that porn star from the valley to go with Beaver to the Roller Prom? - Best $50 I ever spent. I'm telling you boys, that was mega. - Why do they have to sit here? They can sit anywhere. Why here? You done with your slushy? - Chill. They don't even know we're here. We watched this silent movie in class the other day, and uh, this Chaplin guy. It was a black and white, but it was actually really good. And there were, like, no words or anything. They put the words at the bottom of the screen. (voice fades out and music grows louder) When do you think you'll be a blackbelt? I think it's hot. (loud chatter, laughing) - You ain't boinking anyone, Peeve. You must've been jerking like his little bro. - [Jack] Cricket, I really need to talk to you about something. - Oh my God. Stop being so serious! You depress the shit out of me. Are you, are you breaking up with me? Jack? Are you breaking up with me, Jack? - It's not you, Cricket. It is not you. - Oh my God, we're breaking up. Is it because I got fat? You know that I'm trying to lose weight and I'm really- - It's not you. Seriously! Please believe me. - Don't say that, that's the cheesiest thing. - But, I mean it. - I think I'm... I knew it. You're not into me, are you? That's why your dick didn't get hard that night. That's why your dick didn't get hard that night under the pier! (guy sneers, laughing) - I love you, but... I'm not a good boyfriend. - What do you mean? - I love you, but I'll hurt you. - [Cricket] Wait. Did you screw Layla? - No, I didn't screw, no. - Who did you screw? You did, you fucked someone! You fucked someone, didn't you? You fucked someone, didn't you? - Please, just... Don't be unkind. - [Cricket] I was good to you. I respected you and loved you with all your hangups! Tell me. Did you look into her eyes when you were doing her? Did you? Did you see me? Did you? I spent my entire senior year on you. On us! And you cheat on me? - I have these feelings. - Shut the fuck up with 'these feelings,' okay? We all have feelings you asshole. You're not special! You didn't think about my feelings when you fucked whoever that you fucked, now did you? You didn't think that maybe that I'd have some feelings, too? Well you can take those feelings, and your useless limp dick, and you can shove them up your ass. Because you can't have my heart. You had my heart, but you can't have it anymore. Not no more! You know, you're right. You should be embarrassed. You have no purpose. Your whole existence is embarrassing. If I were you, I'd highly consider taking those late night thoughts and follow through with them. But if I were to bet, you'd fuck them up too. (guys laughing) Your brother's a cock sucker! - Oh my God! (guys jeer, laughing) - Motherfucker. (stuttering) Faggot. (screams) Fuck! Fucked up! (sobbing) (loud 80's music) - Am I interrupting something? - What's it look like, Tito? - Do you think I could have your autograph? I'm a big fan. - Split! (thud) - You know I, uh, never... I never.. I never told anyone this before. But, I um... (sighs) You know Scooter? From the neighborhood? Well we were young, and uh... I sucked his dick once, and he sucked mine, and I'm not a fag or anything, you know. I mean, no offense. - I know you're not gay. - Just playing doctor. If there were any damn fucking chicks in the neighborhood, it would have, it would have been a chick, you know? But... (sighs) No chicks. You know, we were fucking young. Young. I won't tell anyone if you don't want me to. I mean, I won't say anything, you know? - I don't care. - Just saying I'll keep my fucking mouth shut. - I really don't care. - Woo hoo! Look, it's a fag mobile, boys! I bet there's some kind of queers int here. Alright! (laughing) Show 'em your ass, Anus. Oh you like that? (guys jeering) Oh you like that? - I love you for who you are. Not what you think you should be. - [Jack] I have this fire in me to do something. Be somebody important. Make a statement. I want a reason, you know? Just existing isn't enough. (80's dance music) (mic screeches) (crowd chatter slowly quiets) My name is Jack. My name is Jack, and I'm a queer. I'm so fucking queer. I'm as queer as they come. This is what you wanted to see, right? This is what you wanted to hear? That uh... I'm a faggot. Well now that that's done... What do you got to say for yourselves? No, what're you gonna say about me that's not already known? (sharp exhale) Do you know... What you could've done to me? Do you know how responsible you all could've been? No. How could you know, you're all stupid people. You're stupid, stupid people. And I, um, I want something out of this life. And I will be someone in this life. Okay? This one! The one I'm living. What will you all be? You know you're losers. Losers that'll add up to nothing. You have no soul. You don't know what it's like to love someone. You come here, you skate around, go to the movies, hold hands; that's not love. Okay? That's pathetic. And I have more love in me than all of you combined. I know that. You can't take that away from me. I'm sorry, but you can't fucking have it. (thud, feedback) (low heartbeat) Done. (dance music) - You can do this. (sighs) You can do this. - So handsome! - Mom, can I speak with you for a sec? - Sure, sweetheart. Are the boys giving you a hard time about being in the band? - No. - It's a girl, isn't it? - Yeah. (chuckles) - [Mom] What's her name? Do I know her? - No, I'm not sure if I want to go there just yet, okay? - You really like this girl. - Yeah, I do. I'm gonna see her tonight. - [Mom] Tonight? - Yeah. - [Mom] At the rink? - Yeah, she works there, you know? So she's gonna be there. And I want to get her something nice. Or special. Or both. - How much do you need? - No, Mom, I don't want to take money from you, okay? Not with the operation, no. - I'd do anything for you. Honey, let me ask you something. Do you really love this girl? - Yeah, I do. (chuckles) Mom... No, this is Grandma's! - If you really love her, you take it. If not, it'll always be here for you. - I do really love her, you know? (dog barking) Hi Mrs. Harris! - Peeve! - Yo. 'Sup? Gimme a bottle of that red vintage shit. - What? - And then make sure it's vintage, fucka, cause my girl likes her roses old. - Peeve, you ain't screwing some bitch. And if you don't get your dweeb ass out of my store in the next 20 seconds, I'm gonna fuck up your already deformed face! - Okay, okay. - Harold Beaver. - That poor dude. - Biggest loser of all losers at school. Even a bigger loser than you, Peeve. - Is that the freak with tourettes syndrome? - Or the cunt that wears all that Kiss makeup? (chortles) - Shit! Ass! - Fuck, Steve. - I mean, it's a little funny, but it's kinda messed up. - What the fuck is the matter with you, dude? - So you're the one that paid that porn star from the valley to go with Beaver to the roller Prom? Right? - Best $50 I ever spent. I'm telling you boys, that was mega! (laughing) - Wait, so... So what did Beaver do this time? - It's not what he did. Layla. - [All] Oh! - Man! - Layla? - Yep, Layla, Layla. - Layla? - Layla dickweed! What are you, retarded? - Not Layla. - We paid Layla a buck a day to date this dude. We wanted to see how long she could go. - How far did she get? - Jumping to the end of the story here, alright? Let's start at the beginning. So she comes up to him in gym class, asks him if he wants to play some tennis. You know, hit some balls back and forth. (guys chuckle) Damn sure he couldn't jerk his own nut. - So... How far did they get? - Three days. - Three days? What? - That's a long fucking time. - No, like, like... How far did they get? - I think the dweeb tried to put his hands down her pants to feel her twat. That's what did it, man. (guys laughing) She refuses to say they even swapped fluids, but I have my doubts. - Bull shit! (overlapping chatter) - You'll be our next victim, Peeve. (guys ooh) - No. I, I, (stammering) I can't anyway. - What do you mean you can't? My, my, (stutters) my dick broke. (loud laughter) - What do you mean it broke? - Your dick broke? - It broke, man. It just broke, okay? - How do you break a dick, dude? - Like, this is my dick. - It's about that size! (laughing) - Yeah, but you're not boinking anyone. You must've been jerking, like his little bro. (chortles) - Look, like, like, this is my dick. - No! (guys laughing) - So what's broke? - I can't wiggle it when I piss sometimes. - You are so full of shit, Peeve. - I wouldn't come within 10 feet of that pussy. I want him to fuck a skunk. - I fucking hate that kid. - [Blonde Guy] I beat Mike Tyson's punch out. - So you gonna join the club? - What will I get if I do? - What do you mean? - If I join this little club of yours, what do I get for my membership? - Nothing. You get to save the rink so they don't tear its ass down. - I'm not talking about that membership. - $10. - $10? $5. - Listen, I have other customers. - Yeah, I bet you do. (video game sounds) (groans) (man and woman moaning) - You're loose. Can I stick it in your ass? - No! (moaning) - I'll give you 10 bucks to date Steve the Peeve for a week. - Okay. - Yeah? - [Layla] Yeah. - Steve man, stop trying to fucking fit in. You can't be in the band. - You're such a bogart. - Most definitely. - Woah, what do we got here? - J, man, come on! - Oh! - Come on! - Who's the lucky girl, Peeve? - It's my Grandma's, man! (jeering) Come on! J, man, come on! Okay, please? (laughing) (both guys mocking) Guys I think you broke it! - You said your Grandma's dead. She won't be needing it. - God, she's so neat. - I think she has her eyes set on that juice dude. Want me to get the 411? - They look at him spin them records like he's some fucking move star or something. I hate people like that. - What, people who have a job? - She's such a cock tease. Look at that sweet ass. - I'd like to suck on 'em while I play Kong! Maybe this'll be the first chick you actually date. - Eh, I've dated. - Okay. - Yeah. - Sure. - Shut up. - What the fuck are you still doing here? (camera shutter clicks, prints) - Adios! - That's goodbye, Layla. - What's up? - Trying to get E laid. Wanna help? - Damn skippy, for a price. - Screw you all! - What, are you crying? - No. (sniffles mockingly) How's Harry Beaver, huh? - Oh! (laughs) Elliot has the hots for wonder woman over there. - Angel. - What've you been up to, Layla? - Fucking formal, Steve. - [Steve] What? - [Elliot] Steve wants to fuck you, Layla. - [Steve] No I don't! I can't anyway. - I'm gonna go smoke a fatty. Catch ya pimps lata! Good luck with the wonder woman. - Won't be as easy as you. (Layla spits) (J laughs) - [Layla] Hola. - That's hello, bimbo! - Wanna join, Peeve? - Go on Peeve, go. Make sure you wear a hat. (coughing) - That's surely a fatty. - You have hot wheels? - Yeah. I picked up some last week. I mean, it needs some work, you know? It's, like, it's got a few bumps and stuff. - Fucking love hot cars. - Yeah, my car is hot. You know, like... Like really fucking hot. Like the hottest fucking car ever. - You saying 'fuck' just doesn't sound right. Like you're not meant to say it, or something. You ever feel that some people can't swear? Cause they sound like an ass. It's cool to say 'fuck.' Just not coming from you. Sounds real stupid. (coughs) - What you're doing for the rink, it's a real ace, you know? Do you think it'll work? - No. I think it'll be torn down and forgotten, like all of us. - Yeah, I guess so. I want to be in the military. So that maybe I can help and save things. Save people. - So are we gonna stand here like erect dicks all night, or are we gonna go do something? (playful music) Who's your girlfriend? - I don't have a, a girlfriend. - Really? Hoods in school say you're a nerd, or a narbo. I always thought you were pretty dexty, really. Pretty rad in the school band anyhow. - Thank you. - I don't know about that tux, though. - I'll take it off pretty soon. I think. - So what do you want? Spit, $30. Swallow, $50. I'll gargle for an extra $5. I'm not in the mood for full service, sorry. - Layla, I don't, I don't want that. - Peeve! Now I really do have to go back to work! - No, I don't, I'm not asking you for anything. - You came to promote my pussy, yeah? - No! I just.. I just was hoping that we could talk. - You don't... want? - No. Well, I mean, yeah. I mean I think that you're really, I think that you're really pretty. But I, I wasn't hoping to hook up. I just thought maybe that we could chill? - Yeah, &quot;chill&quot; doesn't sound right coming out of you either. - I was thinking that right after I said it. - I wanna show you something. - [Steve] How many more steps is it? - [Layla] A few! - [Steve] I'm kind of scared of heights. You know? (Layla laughs) - [Layla] You want to be in the military? Man up, soldier. This is it. My little getaway. - It's nice. It seems like, cozy, you know? Got a mattress. Table. - Got lots of stuff. - Yeah. You got lots of stuff down here. Why do you come here, again? - Why not? It's just far enough away from the shit. (chuckles) You want to sit down? - Okay. (cough) So... Is this where the... Is this where the guys come? Is this where the guys come to... Do things with you? (shutter clicks, printing) Ouch. - Thanks for the meow ears. - Do you like 'em? - Yeah. (engine rumbles) (hollering) - Look at what we found, boys. - Oh, hey there lovebirds. - I'll take that. Meow. I knew I'd find you here, dog. Your own little hooker avenue. - The fuck are you looking at? - [Guy in Plaid] Damn! - [Guy in Leater] That is one fugly looking tux there, Peeve. Man, what the fuck? You look like a smurf. - [Guy in Demin] Yeah, why are you wearing that? - I'm taking it off. - No, he's keeping it on. - Shut the hell up. I'm gonna cut to the case. It's been a long day for me. I want head. Not from you, Peeve. So don't get so excited. Now... Fetch! Little doggy. Peeve, you may want to turn around. This might be a little much for you. - Thanks Sean, but Layla doesn't do that any more. - Oh yeah? And who are you, huh? Her pussy ticket taker? (guys laugh) - Leave us, jock straps. - I'm sorry, but did anybody invite you to join in on this conversation, whore? - Leave us alone, jackasses. - I'm getting fucking tired of this. I tossed $10. You wanted $10. A deal's a deal. What, you want more huh? You want more? Now suck me, bitch. You better open up wide, too. Cause I'm growing a mile a minute. It must be a full moon, boys! - [Guy in Plaid] Sure is. - That's it, Sean. Back off, and you leave us alone. Or else. - Or else? What? Peeve? - Or else maybe I'll start breaking shit! - Oh yeah? - Yeah! - Speaking of breaking, I heard from the dingleberry that your dick broke, Peeve! (guys laugh loudly) Now how the hell do you manage to break a dick? Certainly wasn't from fucking. - You're such an ass. - Wait, wait... With her? You and her, Peeve? Now that's some funny, bogus shit. Wow, cat ears. Best you could do with momma's money, huh? (laughing) - You know what's funny, Sean? - [Sean] What? - Yeah. I do have a broken cock. (laughing) Yeah, it's so broken I can barely get it up. And yet Layla's here with me. And I don't have to toss chickens on the ground to stay with my non-athletic asshole! - Dissin' me, Peeve? - Yeah. Yeah, I guess you could call it that, you three time senior bitch! - Pick up the money, Meat Flaps. (scoffs) You know... I can't stand the thought of sharing the same dirty cunt with you anyway, Peeve. You two skanks deserve each other. You're not the only whore on the pier. Later pussies! Let's go get a brew, boys. - Aren't you afraid of being hurt? - I think I've run out of emotions. - Layla, that's not what I meant. I don't have hot wheels. - Me either. (crickets chirping) (sniffing) - Was I such a bad mother? Is that it? Was I such a bad mother? - [Elliot] We can't have any privacy in here. No fucking privacy in this shithole apart- - So what, you'll coke yourself to death? Is that what I raised? - [Elliot] I'm an adult, okay? I'm an adult, you don't know me! You think you know everything there is to know about me because you just so happen to be my mother? You don't know shit! You don't know what goes on up here! - [Mrs. Harris] I am your mother goddammit. I'm your mother! - Oh, lucky for me! Thank you. Oh, you're taking over Dad's role now, huh? Do you think this is normal? Who the fuck are you? Who the fuck are you? Do you live here? No! Do you love me? Do you love me? If you love me so much, why did you let it happen, huh? If you love me so much, why did you let it happen? Come on Jack. What the fuck are you doing, man? Are you busting your own nut? Let's fucking go! Jesus. Why don't you just go fuck Stud? Go fuck him, because you don't give a fuck about us! I fucked things up with my mom, man. - Like she's one to blabber. Screwing one of her student boy toys. Just wait 'til the school finds out. That should be fun. (scoffs) I wanna be there for that. (mumbling) Dude you gotta focus on the gig. - [Elliot] She's my mom, man! - It's fucking important. Your mom's a loser, Elliot. It's bunk, but true. - No, she's not a loser. How's what we're doing any different than what she's doing? - I'm not some 40-something year old teacher. You don't see my mom sucking a teen dick. I mean... Your mom's a hot chick. I wouldn't mind it being my shaft, but it's different. She's the authority. You're not getting soft on me, are you? I'm just saying, you know, she's sucking The Stud's cock. - I'm not going soft. - Don't be going pussy on me! Next thing you're gonna be putting on skates like all the other sissies. This has to be a killer night! - Maybe we're trying too hard. - What? - We are not gonna relive all these years in one evening. Might as well just deal with the fact that after tonight... Everything's gonna change. Skating's for sissies, though. - Okay look, Angel. This is what you do. I know this'll work. It always works for me. - Is that why you're still single? - Look who's talking Mr. Afraid-Of-Making-A-Commitment. So you go in there, you know she'll be at Mrs. Pac-Man, the chick likes the damn game. You go up to her, and you say, &quot;Hey Angel, &quot;I got the 7th highest score in Asteroids. &quot;Wanna come watch me play?&quot; (both laugh) - Yeah well, I suck at Asteroids. - Yo, what's taking your bro and sis so long? Take 20 minutes to get a fucking burger? Think we have time before they come out? - Sure. (sniffing) - That's what I'm talking about! (laughs) Woah! Back in business. (loud 80's music) - Anyone ever tell you you look like Molly Ringwald? - Who's that? - Yeah. Right. I'm in a band. Yeah, I'm in a band. We're playing here tonight. We rock hard. Rock hard? You know, it's a double-entendre. I think it's pretty original. (game mechanics beeping) Your skate's broke. You're missing a stopper. Pretty bad at this game. - The baddest. Didn't need a complete stranger to tell me that, either. - Right on. Want me to get a shake with you? - Don't you know how to pronounce a word? (scoffs) - What do you mean? You're kinda sarcastic. - Are you nervous? - Me? Nah? Why would you say that? - [Angel] I've seen you watching me. - Just hanging out with my boys, you know? - Not just today. Every weekend. - Yeah, well... I have to say. I have a crush of sorts. - So in the weeks that you've been watching me ever so closely, what have you found out? I mean, I know you've been surveying me for at least a few months now. How could you possibly know that such a crush could exist? - Well... I know you're beautiful. I know you have an amazing body. - Shh, damn! Really? Is that all you could come up with? That I'm beautiful? - I know you love this game. I know if somebody's on it you offer to pay for the next game if you can get in. I know you kick ass at this game, and you've asked the owner to stop pulling the plug. I know you dig strawberry milkshakes on Sundays. Sometimes you get banana, but not before 5, at least not that I've seen. I know that you wear green shirts cause you feel like green is your worst color making it less likely for dudes to ask you out but little do you know that dudes could give two shits what color shirt you have on. You have two favorite sneaks. Your absolute fave is the Cons. You refuse to leave them in the holding area cause you're afraid that someone's gonna steal 'em so you always bring 'em around with you wherever you go. You're a rad skater, and you love to show off your skills. Oh, and you, you say 'fuck' a lot. - Let's get a fucking shake. - [Elliot] So... You're 18. You excited about graduating? - And you're 19, and do what? - I was gonna go to college last year, but- - So you're a richie from the hills who comes here every weekend with a new girl for what reason? - Not rich. - I'm not rich. - My father has money. But he hasn't been around since the epic split. He's trying to get custody of us or some fucking moronic shit like that. But I'm 19, see? So I'm an adult. Nobody owns me, you know? - Do you like him? - Who? - Did I stutter? - Where do you live? - Mm, you already know that, don't you? - No. - You're lying. - I'm not. - You are! (scoffs) - Okay, I may have heard a few things. - Bingo! You heard that I am a bad, bad girl, and that nobody wants me. - Well I saw you talking to that pompous disc jockey. - And? - So what is he, like, your boyfriend or something? - [Angel] Why would you think that? - [Elliot] I saw you talking to him. I don't know. - Are you my boyfriend? - What? No. - And I'm talking to you, correct? So Elliot, who are you? - [Elliot] Who am I? - Yeah. I mean, I know you're in a band. Rock hard. - I don't know. - You don't know who you are? - What do you mean? What do I want out of life? - Chill man, I'm not being deep. I'm just asking you who you are. - And I'm responding with 'I don't know what the fuck you're asking.' - Did he hit you? - You make me uncomfortable. - Why? - Cause. - Did you mean to say &quot;because?&quot; &quot;Cause&quot; is not a word. I overheard your posse talking about some kid from school that you pranked? - Who? Steve the Peeve? - [Angel] No. But I did see you play a game of goon catch with his grandmother's necklace. (snorts) - I was just messing around with Jaso- - I'm talking about the kid with tourettes. - Harry Beaver? How did you find out abo- - I have good hearing. - Well I didn't have anything to do with him, or Layla, or with the (snorts) porn chick, okay? It's all Jason. - But you laughed. (sighs) My skates aren't broke, by the way. - Yo, chill with that shit, man. You're starting to look like fucking shit! - [Jason] Who, me? So what's the plan? - Bowling. (scoffs) I don't know. I'm gonna ask Angel to go bowling with me. (laughing) - That's funny shit. - The fuck? - Is that zit makeup? - Screw you! You got any cash flow? - Damn, I'm tired of being your Mr. Miyagi. (sniffs) I wonder if the fag-tag's gotten Cricket's slushy stains out of his fag-tag. - Knock it off. - What? - It's not funny. - What, it's chill for you to make fun of the fag-tag but I can't? - It's different. He's my brother. (sighs) You know what? Nevermind, man. Just... I change my mind. (sniffs) (pins clatter) You see these little dots down here? You should try to put the ball on the second dot from the right. - Why? - Because, I don't know. It's what I do. - Cause, I don't know. Really? You seriously just said that to me? - Yep. (sighs) Okay. Um... Alright, and, oh! You got your fingers in the wrong hole. - Oh really? - [Elliot] These, yeah. - Okay. - [Elliot] Yeah. - [Angel] Like that? - Exactly. Alright, okay. So what you want to do is, you want to keep your eye on the dot, and you want to just try to keep your approach nice and even. - You're the one that's twitching. - That's cause people are watching us. - Oh yeah? Look at them. That's horrible. Does it make you uncomfortable? - Uh, yeah. Yeah, maybe a little bit. You know? So what if it does? (loud tumble) - Like what the fuck? Oh my God. Oh my God, I was like I was so close. I was so close! - It's not that bad. - Like whatever. No... (sighs) Hold me! I need comfort. (sighs) Tighter! My body, like, really, really needs to be held right now. Isn't this the part where the boy is supposed to give the girl, like, a confidence booster? Tell me that I don't suck balls! Okay, I need my boy to tell me that I don't suck balls! - You two play pairs? - What's up Vivaldi? - Vivaldi? Is that really his name? - Maybe another time, huh? - [Vivaldi] Come on. - Yeah, come on baby! Let's do it, huh? Let's play pairs. (80's music) Shut your mouth. Put your arms around me. Just move back and forth, as if you're dancing without the skates. - My band is rock hard, we don't skate, okay? - Hey, stop worrying about what other people think. Look, nobody is looking at us, and if they do, who gives a fuck? - [Elliot] They will if I fall. - You really are shy. - Shy? Shy is not the word. - [Voiceover] Hey dudes and dudettes, gather your beverages for the last slow dance of the Toy Soldiers. Grab your women low, grab that one you love and hold him or her tight and give 'em a kiss- - You want to kiss me? - You think we should? - Here, give me your hands. For all those months... You know, The months you were watching me? I was disappointed that you didn't speak to me. - [Elliot] For real? - That's why I was talking to the Peter. - [Elliot] Who's the Peter? The disc jockey. I wanted to see if he had the 411 on you. - You know, with the, uh... With the ring sent to the ashes tomorrow, you know, I... I didn't know... Tonight would be, you know... I didn't know if I'd ever get to, you know, see you again. (soft moaning) (indistinct whispers) (heavy breathing, Angel moans) (moaning) - [Elliot] Is it okay if I cum? - [Angel] What? - [Elliot] Can I come? - You have a fucking condom on. - [Elliot] So it's okay? - Fucking shut up and come in me already. (heavy breathing) (grunting, moaning) - Why do you live here? What is that place? - You really want to know, huh? - Yeah. I think so. - My boyfriend was killed by a fucking drunk behind the wheel. We were walking home from the pier. I was there. I saw it. The fuck just drove off, like nothing even happened. (somber music) We were gonna spend the rest of our lives together. Only person I could ever trust. So after some of my own findings, which the police failed to do anything with... I took it upon myself to find the delinquent and bash his fucking brains in. I found where he lived. And I beat him down with my skates. Went in his house while he was sleeping. While his wife and kids watched. Made a fucking mess on the white carpet. Even his German Shepherds didn't care that I was making mashed potatoes of his face. They just sat there and watched. I think they were grateful, actually. You know those movies, those stupid teenage movies that show kids who are supposed to be us having a great time? Like... Like this is supposed to be the raddest time of our lives. - Yeah. - They make me sick. - Why? - They always make me feel like I'm missing out on something. I just don't want to miss out on my something. - What's that? - What's what? - Your something? I don't know what that is. But I wouldn't allow you to give up on your something. - Well, well, well. Guess I was wrong about that whole boinking thing. Turn traitor for a piece of tail? - What's up, man? - Look, E, I know this is a sick moment for you, but I just won some green at the table, was wondering if you want to go score some. - Some what, E? - Uh, J, maybe a little later. - Dude, come on, I'm buying! - Later! - You know I hate doing it alone. What, are you getting soft? - Later Jason, seriously. - Is this how it's gonna be? I fucking help you get the bitch. - [Angel] What? - Don't call her a bitch, come on! - Did he tell you that I'm the one who bought the shakes? The dude has no money. - Does it look like I give a fuck about money? - You're right sweetheart, you look like shit. - What the fuck's your problem, man? - I'm just telling the whore here, and I say 'whore' because what chick fucks after the first skate? You have no money because you don't work. - You're coked out, J, shut the fuck up! Shut the fuck up! - You need to wake up, man! The band is gonna suck tonight because of her. She's just a hookup! I'm your bro, okay? She's a bitch! Doesn't that spell it out for ya? - The fuck is your problem? - She lives in the scum house, dude. Did you think this was any more than a fuck? What is this? - Give me the fucking photo. - You have got to be kidding me. - Give me the photo! (paper ripping) Motherfucker! (indistinct yelling) - Get the fuck off me! Get the fuck off me, you fucking loser! Get the fuck off me you piece of shit! You're gone! You're out there, you space cadet. - [Elliot] Shut the fuck up! - You're fucking weak, like your whole fucking family! - You shut the fuck up you piece of shit! - This is all a front! You should've seen what he said about you before tonight; it wasn't pretty! Cockteasing shit! - Bogus! That is fucking bullshit. - Stop hiding behind this front. Just be yourself. - Your faggot bro... He's in the bathroom fucking another queer. - I won't tell anyone if you don't want me to. I mean, I won't say anything, you know? - Don't care. - I'm saying I'll keep my fucking mouth shut. - I really don't care. - Your hand looks pretty bad. Is it broke? - Um... How about the gig? (laughs) - How about the gig. It was a bunk gig, anyway. Our rad beats couldn't save this place. You know, those things that I said to Ma this morning... You know I didn't mean 'em, right? - Yeah. - I didn't mean 'em. I just... Know she's pissed, you know? It blocks out the sound. I remember when I was a kid, growing up in the neighborhood, (scoffs) everybody complained about living next to an airport. For me... it just blocked out the noise in the house. - Okay. (machines beeping) Godammit, you hear me? Please wake the fuck up! Please! God dammit! (machine beeping) (beeping echoes) You! You fucking disgust me. (sweet acoustic music) - I got so much guilt. I got so much guilt in my heart, Mary. I just... I just want to let you know that I'm so sorry. There are no words to describe how sorry I am for it to you and the children. I was wrong. I was wrong and I was terrible. I know that. But these are my children, Mary. I wake up every morning and I think they're still sleeping in the next room. And I wake up and I think you're still lying beside me. I can't eat. Mary, I can't eat. I lost 15 pounds. Yeah, yeah, I still smoke. I'm trying to give it up. Doctor says I need to give it up. I don't want my family to hate me, Mary. Even though I did those terrible things to you, I'd never stop loving you. And I know, okay, okay, I know we're over. I know that. But I'm here for ya. And I don't care, I don't care how hard it is for us to see each other. I still remember the life we had together. I don't care. I'll forever try to repair what I broke. You mean the world to me. You mean the world to me. You're everything to me. (sniffles) And I... Just want you to know that... I love you. Now listen, you don't leave us, okay? Cause you know, if you leave us, then they're gonna be really lost without ya. Get yourself together now. (sniffles) I'll die without you, Mary. I'll die without ya. Where's the nurse? Where's the nurse? There's no nurse here. Nurse? Nurse? (sobbing) I'm so sorry. - Ms. Harris, we left off on the 21st with your response regarding the children. Elliot, Jack, and Sue. - [Mary] Sue Helen. Sue Helen, she's nine. - You wrote 'Twinkie' here. - That's her hair, that's her nickname. - Counselor Austin, has your client prepared a final statement? - Yes sir, my client has. - My ex-wife has a drinking problem. She abuses alcohol, and prescription medication. She's not suited to take care of our children. Elliot, our oldest, has been in trouble multiple times for drug possession. He does not work, he does not attend college. - That's not all my fault. You can't put that all on me, Clyde. You can't put that all on me. - He doesn't work, he doesn't attend college! Oh come on, Mary. - It's not all my fault. - [Clyde] Please. - It's not all my fault. - He sits home all day and does nothing? While you're drinking? I cannot help believing all this has something to do with our living situation. - [Mediator] And uh, when did this behavior start? - With Elliot or Mary? - [Mediator] With Ms. Harris. - December 8th, 1980, 10:49pm. (radio static) - [Voiceover] Former Beatle John Lennon is dead. He was shot and killed Monday night in front of his apartment building in Manhattan. (radio static) - In your complaint, you mention that Ms. Harris, you still use Harris do you? - I do, for the children. - [Mediator] Mr. Harris, you also stated in your complaint that your ex-wife is involved in an inappropriate, potentially illegal relationship with a younger gentleman. Is that correct? - I did not put that in there. I did not! - You signed this report, didn't you? - Yes sir, I did. - [Mediator] Then explain. - Mary and I married when she was young. Elliot was conceived prior to the marriage, which we kept secret from family and friends. She always felt like she was missing out on her youth, or her college years. She had great aspirations of becoming a musician, a songwriter, a poet. - Why are you belittling me? - She always felt like she was missing out on her something. I believe her actions could be stemmed from those disgruntled feelings about becoming a musician, and a songwriter, and a poet. Is that right? - [Mary] Why are you being so mean? - Ms. Harris states that she caught you in a sexual act with another woman in your bed, while the children were home, and that that's the reason we're here today. - That's no excuse. We were already having difficulties. - You could have at least waited until the kids went to school. - [Jack] Hey, stop it! Dad don't hurt her! (Mary screaming) (indistinct yelling) - Mr. Harris, and were you not also accused of nearly breaking your son Jack's arm when he was 12? I mean, couldn't such parenting be responsible for Elliot's behavior? We are talking about the formative years of the child's life, aren't we? - Yes sir. As you already know, I have uh, as you already know, I have already gotten help for that. - During the 17 years of your marriage, was Ms. Harris a good mother to your children? - Well... - [Mediator] Mr. Harris? Lunch is waiting for me. Please answer my questions. Was your ex-wife a good mother to your children for 17 years? - Yeah. Yeah she was. She was a great mom. She was, um, she was uh... The best mom any child could want. She was loving, and she was caring. I have a memory. I bought a carriage, and uh, I remember you pushing that carriage with Elliot for his first time. She was so, she was, ah, she was so beautiful. Best mom in the whole world. - Please Clyde. Please don't take my babies. - [Mediator] Ms. Harris, you talk to me, okay? - He's taking my babies. They're all I have. I can't be without them. Clyde, they're all I have. - [Mediator] Ms. Harris, do you have a substance abuse problem? - Please. - [Mediator] Ms. Harris? Do you have a substance abuse problem? Do you abuse prescription medication? (sobbing) - I've lost my faith. (sobbing) (coughs) (sobbing) (school bell rings) (The Stud groans) - Please Mary, don't do this to yourself. - You're firing me, Donald. I think I deserve to hear a reason. - I really think it's better if we just leave it as- - No, no. That's not okay, that's not okay. - Look, I know the timing isn't the best with everything going- - Goddammit Donald, I'm here aren't I? I'm here with my books and I'm teaching fucking music, aren't I? - Have you been drinking today? Have you? - Do you know what it's like to be alone? Do you have any fucking clue what it's like to be alone, after years of having someone? How hard it is to pretend like everything's okay. Are you afraid to open your eyes in the morning? That the dreams you had, the uh... The family, the uh, the white fence and the fucking dog... That everything is as planned? Oh sure Don, you know, every since, uh, ever since the split life's been really good. Everything's good, Don. I'm great. The kids are really good. We're all great, Don. Bullshit! The truth is... I can't handle the kids and their issues all by myself. I can't even handle my own shit. How the fuck am I supposed to be a parent? But you wouldn't know that, would you? Those, those beautiful Sears portraits on your desk. Don't pretend to understand something you don't know anything about. It makes you look like an ass. You don't know what it's like to be alone. - [Elliot] Do you love me? If you love me so much, why did you let it happen, huh? If you love me so much, why did you let it happen? Cause you're weak, Mary. You're a weak fucking person. You sat there and you did nothing. Why do you think Jack is the way he is, huh? - [Mary] I don't know! - What about fucking Twinkie? You didn't do shit! You are a failure in everything you've ever fucking done! One big, fat, fucking failure! You failed in your music, you failed in your writing, you failed in your marriage. You failed us as a mother! You promised you'd make it stop. You promised us! You think because you're my mother that you're a parent? Why don't you go fuck Stud some more? Why don't you go fuck him, cause you don't give a fuck about us. - Where are my keys? Where are my keys? Fucking keys. (loud thud) (moans) (screams) (loud crash, dishes rattle) He's right. I did fail. But it's not about talent. It's about luck. I love my babies. Do you know that? I love my babies. I love my babies. I love 'em. I love my babies. I love 'em. You know? Do you know it? I love them. I love them so much. (sobbing) (brakes screech) - Mrs. Harris. - [Mary] Please, just give it to me. - What can I get for you? - Same. (static) - Why are you doing this to yourself? I mean, you're very attractive. I was thinking, you know, maybe some time we could go out and grab a drink? If you're free? - Please don't. - You know, like maybe this weekend or something. We could go to Commy's and get some coffee. You know I've seen you hanging out with Stud. - Shut the fuck up. - What? - I said shut the fuck up! - Okay. - You think I'm some whore who sleeps with my students? Is that what you think? - Well... - You all look at me and judge me. How dare you. You think I need your dick? Who are you? You're nothing but a little prick behind a counter, serving me. Me! You've done well for yourself, little prick. Like a little prick would. - You know, everyone wondered why your husband would leave a smoking chick. It's because you're a wino bitch. That's why! - I'm gonna fuck your face! (crashing) - [Employee] Is it true? Artists who fail as musicians end up teaching at public schools? You know, I don't blame your husband for beating your face. I get you like it kind of rough. - You know what? It's not too late. Your music, I mean. It's not too late. It's never too old to be young. - That's from Snow White and the Seven Dwarves. (smooch) (party music) Come on, Mary. Get it together. Do it for your babies. - Hi Mom! I won a fish! - That's nice, sweetheart. Twinkie, where are your brothers? - Jack's dressed like a girl. - Ms. Harris? I'm Freddie. Well, friend of a friend. - Why are you with Twinkie, and where are her brothers? - It's okay. Can we talk for a sec? - I need to find my sons. - It's about Sue. - Come, Twinkie. Let's go get a milkshake. - I think your daughter needs some help. I know I don't know her, and I know I just met her. But I really think you should look into getting her some help. I mean I... (stammers) I don't know what they call it. Well, she told me how she feels about school. She told me how you drop her here with her brothers, to try and get her used to crowds. She knows this. I don't know if she tells you, but she knows what you're trying to do, and she's in pain. She needs somebody. (bottle rattles) Maybe she needs a parent. - I came here to tell my family something. Starting tomorrow, I can't see my family. I came here to tell them that. My question to you is... how do you move forward when your soul is torn apart? (sobbing) I have guilt. (crying) (thuds) - Go play the game, okay? Mary? Come on. Let me help you up. There you go. Hey. Twinkie's doing good. Those things that were said in court... That wasn't me. I would never put you in that situation. Never. - You're taking the children, Clyde. - Mary... Please. I'm just asking for the kids to be safe until we get you help, okay? Are you okay? - Oh. I'm fine, Clyde. I want all my babies around me tonight. We're all gonna be together if it kills me. - Okay. It's just for now. - Hey, if you see Jack and Elliot tell them that their mom is looking for them. - [Clyde] Okay. - All I want is them with me these final hours. - Mary, it's just for now. You can do it. You're my best friend. Mary... You're my only friend. And I miss you. - Not now. Not now. - Okay. Okay, okay. (papers rustling) - [Sue] I'm different. - What, baby? - I'm different, and I don't want to go to school. - I know. - It's okay to be different. It doesn't make me a bad person. - Who said you were a bad person? - [Sue] Dad said you and me are different than other people. - Yeah, what did he say? - He said we're different. We're the creative ones. The artists. - Creative ones. - Why did he come to see me? You said that he went away and I wouldn't see him again. - Because he loves you, Twinkie. Creative one. - [Sue] Mom! (crash, glass shattering) (horns honking, sirens) Mom? Are you okay? - [Doctor] This is Harold. As you can see, Harold is a tourette patient. Harold is a 17 year old young man who began suffering from these things at the age of nine. Today will be the beginning of the end of these fits. We're going to begin his treatment by fitting him with a lower mouth piece to stop these uncontrollable emotions. We're gonna videotape these emotions for a minute or two, just to give the viewing audience a chance to appreciate what he has to go through. This will be the first time we have placed the appliance. Does that hurt? - No, tick, tick... - [Doctor] How does that feel? - Weird. - [Doctor] Weird? It might feel weird, but this is gonna take care of all your pain. Don't you feel any difference? - Fuck! Fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck! Doctor, sorry, sorry, sorry. Your mom's a whore. Sorry. Mom's a whore, mom's a whore. Hooker, hooker! Fucking slut. Suck my dick, suck my dick, suck, suck missile. Missile. Cuban missile crisis. JFK I'm gonna put a bullet in your fucking head. (maniacal laughing) I don't think it's working. - Layla? Hey Layla. - Take a chill pill, Beaver. - Fuck you! Layla, I need to talk to you. Hey, you look at me when I'm talking to you. - Beaver, leave me alone. I'm busy, okay? - Please, it's important. So it's true. - Beaver, you're a nice kid. Listen, it's nothing against you personally. If they had said someone else, like... Steve the Peeve, I would've done the same thing. - But I thought you liked me. - Beaver... - You know, it's one thing to hug me. You know? And kiss me. But why'd you have to say all those things? - What things, Beaver? - That you liked me. And that I was special. Last night in my truck you said you cared for me, and that you enjoyed your time with me, and that you thought I was special. You said those things. Why did you say those things? - I meant them. - Why would you want to break someone? Cause you're a no good rotten cunt. Your cunt is rotten and broken. You are a dirty rotten cunt! You're a no good piece of shit white trash fucked by her father! (crying) You cunt! You cunt, you cunt, you cunt! You no good rotten cunt. - [Layla] I've never felt like such a loser. - Did you really say those things? - What things? - [Steve] That you really liked him. (dog barks) - I'm so, I'm sorry for making a spectacle of myself. I'm just not used to a pretty girl, you know? Liking me. I mean, I didn't mean to say like, I mean like a, like a friend. Like a... - I do like you. Beaver. - Yeah? - Yeah. (dog barking) I should be going now. - Can you hold on for one second? I got these. - Beaver... Shit. - I was gonna give 'em to you earlier, but I didn't know if it was too much, you know? I didn't, I didn't want you to think, I didn't want you to think, think, think, think, think... - [Layla] Think what? - I didn't know you liked me or anything like that. I thought if I gave 'em to you, that you might be turned off or something. And so I figured if I gave 'em to you later, after the date, then even if you were turned off you... I still would've had the date. - Beaver... - I know that seems selfish. Like I'm just thinking about myself, but I'm not. And it doesn't make sense. I'm sorry if I'm talking too much. I'm just new to this. And I didn't want to seem too pushy. Like I was being rude or anything. - They're roses, Beaver. How could that be rude? - Well roses are red, and red means love, sex, marriage, fuck! Fuck, I'm sorry. I also wanted to say, say something. I wanted to say thank you. - For what? - For tonight. When I had my ticks, you my thing, you were pretty cool. You didn't look embarrassed or anything, and I get embarrassed myself sometimes. At the pizzeria everyone was looking at me and laughing, and pointing at me. I can't really describe how it feels to be stared at like there's something wrong with me. But you didn't mind. Or care. Like it was, like it was fine. You know why I like you, Layla? You remind me of my mom. With your green eyes. You're so nice to me. (gasps) - We all have something to be embarrassed about. - Damn, you can pick 'em. Get your ass inside there. - Can I ask you a question? This isn't the same deal, right? - No. I really like this moment with you, Steve. - Is this a moment? - This is most definitely a moment. - You don't have to do these things, Layla. You really don't. - Fuck for money? - I saw you crying behind the skate counter. And this whole Beaver thing... I know he can forgive you. It's bothering you, I can see that. But I'm sure if you just talk to him he can forgive you. You just don't have to do these things, Layla. You're too pretty, and you're too boss. - Why don't I have to do these things? - You're better than that. And if, if you were... if you were my girl, you wouldn't have to do any of those things. - You'd take care of me, Steve? - I would. - Like you did with Sean? - Layla, I don't have a whole lot to offer, I don't have hot wheels. But... You'll give me a reason. - Reason for what? - Just a reason. - You can't blame someone for just doing what they know, Steve. I gotta go do something. Meet me by the pier, 10 minutes? - Okay. - [Layla] Let's take a picture. (shutter clicks, prints) (change rattles) - You look like Ralph Macchio's retarded brother. No don't knock me out, it's not gonna do anything. That looks really stupid. - Woah! Who ordered head? (guys laugh) - [Layla] Here. - Woah. - What's this? - Bri, you taking cash for screws now? Cocksucker, huh? - Grow up, dweebs. - Is this for Peeve? - Yeah, I don't want it. Take it back. - No can do, a deal's a deal. - You gonna let this bimbo dis you like that? - Pussy! - Layla! Look, I'm sorry. You don't want to, that's fine. Take $10 anyway, k? - Hola. - Let's go get our 10 bucks worth, huh? - She looks lonely. Bri, come on man. Come on, you paid her, come on! (thud) (phone ringing) - We want our 10 bucks worth. Spit it, three ways. I'm sorry, did I say spit or split? I said spit. (guys laughing) - Who's first? - Me. Keep a lookout. Quick spazzing, bimbo, and enjoy it. That's right, hold still honey. Ah. Almost done. (guys laugh) How's it feel, huh? How's that $10 worth? (groans) Yeah. - I really, really like her, Ma. There's something... I don't know, there's something about her, you know? - [Vocieover] Does she feel the same? - Yeah. I think she does. She said she does. - Ah, yeah! Almost there. Almost there! (groans) - Consider that a graduation hazing. - Yeah! (laughs) - Oh hey, here's a corndog for the dog. - Hey, how's this feel? Huh, you like this? Or the real thing, huh? (laughs) - [Voiceover] Do you think she's beautiful, baby? - I think so. No, no, I mean... I know she's beautiful. - [Ma] Does she have any idea how lucky she is? - Bri, you're next. Come on man. - I'm okay, I already had some Layla tonight. - Get our seconds; you paid! - Bri, come on man, we don't got all night. We're gonna miss the derby contest. Get in there, come on. - Come on man, I did it! - Right there. (guys laughing) Come one man, just do it. - Nah. - Dude, what's up, you turn fag? - Oh, Bri's a fag, like Jackie! - Fuck you guys, both of you! (screaming) - Oh she's up! (clothes ripping) (Layla screams) - We're not done with you. - She's special, Mom. She's so very special, and she doesn't know it, you know? She needs help, Mom. I love her. And I want to help her, but I don't know how to do it. - [Voiceover] Baby, I'm so happy. You know what I always say? If you're willing to do anything for her, she's the one. - Yeah. - [Voiceover] Would you? - Do what? - [Voiceover] Would you do anything for her? - [Steve] I would. I would do anything for her. - [Voiceover] Will you tell me everything tonight, baby? - [Steve] Yes. - [Voiceover] I want to know all about this lucky girl. - [Steve] No, I'm the lucky one. I know that now. - [Voiceover] I love you. - [Steve] I love you, Mom. (Layla screams) (Layla screaming) - What're you doing? - Hold her down, man. (cheering) Keep going, buddy. (screaming) (muffled sound) Hold still! (guys laughing, cheering) (shutter clicks) - What the hell was that? Let's get the fuck out of here. (thud) - What the fuck, Peeve? (grunts) You're a fucking nobody! - Yeah, take it, you little shit! Fuck you! You're dead, you're dead, you're dead! Fuck you! (groans in pain) - Ah! Ah! - Come on! Let's get out of here! - I remember this guy... Came to my school in Indiana. He was talking about how sometimes, things happen, you know? Things happen. And even though they suck... They happen for a reason. Maybe... Maybe this needed to happen. - You've never had a girlfriend, have you? - I never even kissed a girl. I wanna kiss you. But... My face hurts. My mouth is numb. - I'm done kissing. I promise, I really dig you, Steve. - Should I put this on you, or should I just... give it to you like this? - Steve! - I just want to make sure that I can touch you. - You can touch me. - It's a little broken, I think. - Things are broken. Doesn't mean they can't mean something to somebody. Boys at school call me a dog. I'm okay with being a dog. Dogs just want what people have. They just want to be loved. To be cared for. To be held. They just want to be wanted by someone. Even... The love of just one person. Just the love of one person in the whole world is enough. If I'm a dog... If that's such a bad thing, then so be it. - Cats too. - I'm sorry for what I've done. I know it wasn't you. I'm just sorry for the way I've acted. I'm not a bad person, Steve. I'm not a horrible person. I just have so much guilt. (sobbing) - I just want to be the one person that loves you.
