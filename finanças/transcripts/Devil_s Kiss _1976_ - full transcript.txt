How nice. Why don't you come in? - Your Grace. - Countess of Moncorn. Please don't call me that. I detest that name. I am now Claire Grandier... which is my maiden name. Just call me Claire Grandier... the psychic. This is my only name. The Countess of Moncorn is not more. Don't say that. You still belong with us. Everyone will be happy to see you. Happy to see me like this... penniless and with no future. When bad luck struck, I was in India. By the time I heard of the tragedy, it was too late. Still, you didn't help me when you returned. Your brother bought our stables for almost nothing. But don't you worry... no one recognised me. People don't look at the poor. But I recognised you in Paris. I wanted you to. You must be the only one to know. You must promise me. I give you my word. No one will know anything. The Countess of Moncorn is no longer. Perhaps you could communicate with her spirit. This is no laughing matter. Communication with the other world is the most compelling proof of the immortality of the soul. The same is true about Good and Evil. You invited me to join you tonight... but this party has become boring. And here we are, miles away from Paris. Thank you for sending a car to the station. Let me introduce you to Professor Gruber, an expert in telepathy. His research on animal cell regeneration is stalling, due to lack of funding. The two of us represent the perfect union between spirit and matter. Please come in. My guests are waiting. Has anyone seen my shoes? - Where's my brush? - It's on the bed. Dear friends, in a few minutes, our exquisite models from Claris Creation... will proudly showcase their work... right here, at the Haussemont castle. Come on girls, let's go. We're ready. As soon as this is over, we'll start our little séance. It will be a big surprise. What a waste to try and entertain aristocrats with spiritism while being so utterly bored. Boredom is contagious. I don't think many of my guests believe in spiritism. But that won't be a problem for you. I don't believe in "problems." Those are wordily matters... and I live in another world. Follow me. I'll lead the way. And it is with Betty that we conclude this parade of beauty. And now, ladies and gentlemen, a few surprises. A big surprise. Dear guests, you are about to communicate with the other world thanks to the wonderful psychic... Madame Grandier. How ridiculous. This is typical of the duke. He's always been quite the eccentric. I've never believed in this nonsense. This Duke of Haussemont is really strange. Spiritism, in this day and age? I much prefer the fashion show. For sure. They're flesh and blood... ...amazing flesh. Come on, Betty, go get dressed. We don't have all night. I have to take a shower. Don't wait up. Be quick. Our guests are waiting. Don't worry, I'll be a minute. Don't keep the baron waiting. Let me worry about the Baron de Clanchard. I just don't want to miss the séance. I don't care for that rubbish. Come on, girls, it's about to start. She's not interested... too bad. Put the box down. You like art, don't you? You thief. I like pretty things too. I won't say a word if you treat me well. You whore. Let us now put our hands on the table, creating an endless chain that nothing in the world will ever break. In the Great Beyond float the souls who have passed. In the world of shadows, we shall reunite with the heavenly spirits. I can put you in contact with them. Right now. Five and a half years ago, my brother Laurent had a fatal horseback-riding accident. I would like to hear from him. Please call him. Very well, let us concentrate on the duke and on the departed's spirit. No one is to break the chain. That would be dangerous. I'm calling to you... forces of Good and Evil. Forces of the Darkness, please allow Laurent's spirit to return tonight. Forces of the Living, let him return. do you hear me? Answer me. Tell me you are approaching these premises. I can feel your presence. Is that you? Is that really you? Give me a sign. I must know... is that you? I can feel your presence. It is really you, is it not? Are you here with us? I can feel you. You are near. Yes, you are near. Laurent. What was that? It sounded like a scream. It came from upstairs. Turn on the light. I won't fall for that. Those tricks won't fool me. You are nothing but a bunch of crooks. Everything was orchestrated in advance. How could the duke agree to such a masquerade? What happened? Is she...? She lost consciousness. She must have fainted. - But she screamed. - Betty, how are you feeling? Are you all right? What happened? That was so strange-- the light. The light. What light? What do you mean? The lights suddenly went out. Everything became so strange. But when we got here, the light was on. I was brushing my hair and the lights went out. I suddenly felt a chill and some sort of presence. - A presence? - I'm not sure. It was such an odd sensation. You have to believe me. This used to be his room. I doubt that many people will come back after what happened. I wanted to convince them of something I don't even know or understand. I don't think Betty would lie to us. She'd never met you before. I know that she's telling the truth. There are things you can't lie about. The question is not who's playing whom... The mysteries of the occult remain mysteries surrounded by tangible signs that only those with spiritual prowess can grasp. For them, there isn't any mystery, only despair, laughter or tears when faced with the clash between Good and Evil... which are the same force, only pulling in different directions. You are frightening me. I'll never have peace of mind again. I'll always have the feeling of being spied upon by invisible creatures. Those who saw the whole process don't seem to doubt it. Neither do I. In fact, I would like you to stay. Don't be offended by my words. I would like for you to stay at the castle to continue your research on the occult. Please, think about it. But how do you think-- This is not an act of charity, but a trade. You help me... and I offer you my hospitality. Your hospitality comes a bit too late. You've never forgiven me for buying your stables, have you? And I never will. Let's forget about that for now. I am offering you the chance to continue your research in a calm and peaceful environment. What do you think? I haven't heard you say a word, Professor. You're not the talkative kind. I think words are mostly unnecessary. I know what people think and I act accordingly. We'll stay. Wonderful. So you are an expert in telepathy? That is a field I would love to explore. Loreta, our chambermaid, will be here in a moment. She will show you to your rooms. - Did you call me, sir? - Come in. She is the only woman who's ever lived in this house. A lot of peculiar things have happened in her room... Please, feel free to bring your belongings and stay here permanently. If you need to buy any kind of equipment, - I'll gladly pay for it. I shall return to Paris. Claire, you can stay. I will be back in a few days with my things. Madame, I do remember you enjoy horseback riding. Please, feel free to ride your favourite horses. I'm sure you'll love this area. François, check over there. The bastard can't be too far. Poor thing. And stop crying. Nothing happened, all right? Come on, don't you worry. Thank God we arrived in time. He didn't touch you. You. Come out of there. So it's you they're looking for. Come in. Sit down. Right here. Stay put. I'll be right back. Joseph, take my horse. I'm going to get something from the kitchen. I'd rather have dinner in my room. Just an old habit. Please ask His Grace to excuse me. You'll sleep here for now. Wait. You'll eat when I say so. Sit down. Here. Pace yourself. Will you give me a hand? I want to take these to the cellar. If that's what you want, I won't interfere with your experiments. But please, don't keep me in the dark too long. We'll share all our secrets soon enough. Show a little patience. Curiosity is eating me up. I don't know how long I'll be able to wait. I am not a patient person. I just cannot wait. Well, I can. For as long as I have to... alone, in the dark... for the invisible. All that because of other people. For years, I've done nothing but wait. I've waited and I've seen the Vulcars take Philippe's belongings. they said he never took the opportunity to marry me... a poor medical student. Stop torturing yourself. The Count of Moncorn-- Philippe committed suicide because no one would help him. His death was partly my fault... because I took him out of his world. He can stay. Maybe he can help you. This is what we've always longed for: I get all the necessary equipment, and you reach your goal, thanks to your victims. "Victims"? That's not the exact word. For years, I've been longing to avenge Philippe. People are all the same. Only thinking of themselves. But I am stronger than them... much stronger. Satan and Astaroth... will help us avenge the insults Philippe and I have received. On this book of Astaroth, I swear... that this castle will be cursed for centuries to come. It shall be overcome by Lucifer's power. We shall soon put the principal of solaria regeneration to use. I'm almost ready. These dead cells are about to regenerate. In a few hours, brand new cells will appear thanks to the injected microorganisms. That will occur only if the supreme breath of life penetrates the cells. Only the Prince of Darkness can help us. If we invoke him, the soul of one of his servants will enter the empty body-- a necessary process to regenerate the human machine. Poor man. What a tragedy. From what they say, the wheels of the car smashed his head. They wanted to bury him immediately. See? They're burying him in the potter's field 'cause he had no family. By the way, the duke left for Paris this morning. He asked me to tell you. He had a phone call. He'll be away for a few days. Very well, Loreta. Thanks. Romain... l think we found what we'd been looking for. Jean, anytime is a good time. What are you doing here? I'm now in charge of the duke's stables. I wanted to talk to him, but unfortunately, I heard he'd left. Yes, he's left for a few days. So you'll be free to see me. You think there's such a thing as freedom here? We'll find a way... you'll see. Men have only one thing on their minds. Spending days around horses can be boring. You don't dedicate all your time to the duke, right? Him? He never acts on it. Be careful. You'll tear my dress. Not if you take it off... There it is. Let's start digging. - Claire, keep an eye out. - Of course. Almost there. One last pull. Don't be afraid. I came to bring you a few candles. - 1 wasn't expecting to see you. - The transformer's damaged. We'll be without electricity for a few days. Come on, hurry up. Someone might see us. Joseph didn't see anything when I asked him for candles. He's not suspecting anything. What's wrong? Is it your heart again? You mustn't strain yourself. Some day, my heart will give out on me... that is certain. But don't you worry... I still have some strength left. The professor is working so hard, he can't even join us for dinner. Try to understand... you put so much pressure on him for quick results that the poor man is working day and night. I hope the power failure isn't too bothersome. Candlelight isn't the best, but we're used to it. We were told we'd be without electricity for a whole week. I am fascinated by your research. But, as promised, I won't be a bother. Who is it? It's me. Open the door. So, how is it? I'm done. It wasn't easy, but I've rebuilt his head. Would you like to see? How hideous. That's exactly what we wanted. He's going to be quite the creature. We'll start our final experiment tonight. I'm about to inject him with some regenerative cells. In five to six hours, the rejuvenation process will be completed. The microorganisms will spread throughout the body on their own. Let's hope the process ends within the next six hours. That's when we'll need the powers of the occult forces. It's been more than six hours. The transformation should have already occurred. Let's take a look. Let's hope I am strong enough to dominate the Satanic mind that will take control of the poor guy's body. I conjure you, Lucifer, Lucibel and Satan. By the powers of this magical talisman, the Book of Astaroth... Solomon's talisman.. The one and only talisman... I am calling to you, I am coming to you. Will I be the chosen one? I want to be your slave. From now on, my body and my soul shall be yours forever. May your mysterious forces rule over mortals and immortals. Occult Forces of the Darkness... I am calling to your Emperor Lucifer. Beelzebub, prince of darkness, Asterov, great Duke... I am coming to you as your slave. Make this body yours, and answer our prayer. By Lucifuges, Barbes and Agares... Belial and Belphegor, Molecome and Esmudy, I invoke your Satanic forces. Astarte, Queen of the darkness... powerful and eternal spirit... make this body an instrument for revenge. Make this body an instrument for revenge. What an unexpected storm. Loreta, shut the window. I'm getting cold. I'd only felt this way the night of the séance. How odd. By the way, why haven't Madame Grandier and the professor joined me for dinner? Go to the cellar and tell them I'm expecting them. Satan, you've sent us a lost soul endowed with eternal powers. Astarov and Astarte... may your powers remain indestructible. May Belial's incantation be fulfilled. Stop here. Don't move. Come now. - Look out. - Calm down. Now go sit down. - Who is it? - It's me, Madame. His Grace sent me to inform you dinner is served. We won't be joining him tonight. We'll stay down here. What we are working on is of the most importance. Tell the duke we'll show him our results soon. - Is that clear? - Yes, Madame. I'll tell him. It's all right now, Romain. I didn't think I could hold out. I have to make incredible efforts to control him telepathically. My heart is about to burst. Luckily, the antidote I injected him with... put him in a temporary state of trance. God, it hurts. He'll be out of his lethargy once we give him another shot. I think he'll be a good tool, but we have to keep an eye on him. I can't afford to be distracted. I'd lose control of him, and that could be dangerous because he's extremely strong. I haven't been able to restore his verbal skills. His brain suffered too much damage. It makes no difference. Tonight, at last, I will see my dreams of revenge come true. And you will become the Duke of Haussemont. If there's nothing else I can do, I'll go to my room. You may go. Don't you think we-- Have a good night, Loretta. I almost forgot... Tell Joseph and Charles to let me sleep in. I'm rather tired and I'd like to get some sleep. Remind Joseph to call the electric company to see if they can come by to fix the transformer. Very well, sir. Who are you? The fire has been put out, but unfortunately, nothing could be done for the duke. You said the electricity was out, but the lights are on. We found a cigarette end by the duke's body. I was expecting that. The duke might have set his bed on fire when he fell asleep. But why the candelabra on the bed? Maybe he lost consciousness while lighting his cigarette. All we can do is wait for the autopsy report. Joseph, come pick me up when the professor returns. I assume you've searched the castle for some clues. Of course I have. Everything is in order. Please understand that this situation is quite upsetting. We were the duke's guests. I understand, but I also know you were planning on moving in for good. And that's one more reason why we are so sad. The duke was our protector and benefactor. The professor was conducting some experiments in the cellar. What kind of experiments? That's confidential... except for you, of course. The duke loved his horses and I was in charge of developing a vaccine. Please keep that to yourself. That is confidential professional information. I understand. Please go on. Now that the duke is dead, we are homeless. We are suffering from this tragedy more than anyone else. Good morning, Judge. I assume you came to collect the body? If your men have taken the customary pictures, I guess we can leave now. Very good, Susanne. A few more. Give me some sensuality. Ready? Now-- there you go. Now close the piano. Lie down next to the piano. A few more, and we'll be done. I'll go. Don't move. I'll be back. Richard, a telegram for you. Don't you worry. The castle is big enough for all of us. You can go on with your experiments on the horses. Go on with it. I'll probably wear them out anyway, so to speak. I have no desire to kick you out. Uncle Victor was wealthy enough to feed an army. Please stay. We are truly grateful. We weren't expecting anything less from a person like you. You are truly noble. Don't say that. Uncle Victor thought I became too much of a liberal... after Laurent, my father, died. I'm surprised I'm still in his will. Sir, Joseph brought your belongings. Which room will you be staying in? In yours, my dear. Do you mind? How sweet. I'm flattered. What's your name? listen, Loretta, I've slept in the worst places, so anything will do. Put me wherever suits you best. Anything else I can do? Don't bother with formalities. They disgust me. Let everyone do their own thing. As for me, I'll take a nap. Careful. - Slowly. - Go ahead. Thank God, we had time to hide the dwarf and the coffin. If you're tired, we can take a break. We can stay here. No, it would be too late. We can't afford to waste any more time, and I'm already losing my strength day by day. We just cannot wait. I'll wake him up. I hope this experiment works. Romain. He escaped. Romain, wake up. Can you hear me? Give me a hand. - We'll keep her here. - How could that happen? I don't know. Maybe the drugs stopped working. I think... I know... His body must have acclimatised to the serum, and the injections had less effect on him. We'll have to give him a higher dose every time. And how do you feel? What bothers me is that I can't control the zombie. He must be far away by now. I can still feel his telepathic waves, though. I think I can find him. Let's go, then. We have to find him. What about the dwarf? No one will notice an additional grave at the cemetery. Over there. I can feel the waves. I can feel him near me. Stop right here. He's close. Let me concentrate. There he is. Get the syringe and double the dose. The castle of Clanchard is a few miles away. We should take advantage of that. Let's take him to the baron. But Claire... we can't do that. We're not prepared. And I'm afraid of the horrific actions perpetrated by this creature. You're forgetting one thing. The fact that you lost your attraction for me, or for any woman, doesn't mean you can withdraw our agreement. If you are afraid, don't worry. Philippe and I were regular visitors. I know the place. I could draw a map of it... with my eyes closed. We can follow the zombie. To get in, the castle has special doors for guests. And today's guests will be... us. We haven't seen her all day. We checked her room. Her things are still there. How strange. We'll need to call the police. This could be a murder case. Look, the paper mentions a murder in the area. "The Baron of Clanchard and a maid were found dead this morning. The butler found the baron, who had been strangled.” How tragic. Loretta must have been killed. Nobody will suspect anyone for the murder of Loreta because she's not dead. In her body lay the powers of Astaroth and Lucifer. Wait, I'll be right down. What a surprise. - 1 wasn't expecting to see you. - You left Paris so quickly. I need to look over my inheritance. - 1 don't want to be in your way. - You're joking. I've been bored out of my mind. This place is quite austere. This is my room. Make it yours for as long as you want. - What will the servants say? - What can they say? We are all adults. Loreta's a clever girl. She sleeps next door. She wasn't feeling well, so I allowed her to take a break. You "allowed" her? You're the new duke here. That's right. I can't go on. I hope Claire gets tired of this soon. It's a pity the professor couldn't join us. He must be busy. He is indeed busy with the vaccine. It's best not to disturb him. I'm sure you understand. Of course. Susanne will stay with us for a while. It's a pleasure to have you here. You know what? I'm not particularly fond of that woman. I'm not either. I'm fond of you. You can say that again when you get tired of me. - Then we'll see. - Why wait? Let's just end it now. Not a chance. Come here. Come on. Take your clothes off. What happened? Why don't you talk to me? Talk to me. What was that? It sounded like a scream. It came from Loreta's room. She looked possessed. I've never seen such fury in a woman. It was horrible. I was planning on seeing you tomorrow. I'll have your uncle's final autopsy report by 5pm. The coroner needed more time, considering the corpse was badly burnt, especially the head and neck area. We found strangulation marks on the duke. My uncle was murdered? Something strange has come up. Please come take a look. Madame, would you like a cognac to calm you down? Thank you, Joseph. But hurry. I don't want to be alone. The results look strange. And this is the only electroencephalogram we can do. She's like dead. I've just put new electrodes on her, and here's what came out. What will we do with him? Let's leave him here and set the house on fire. The cops will be here soon. What about the zombie? We can't leave him here. He could give us some trouble. It would be much easier to just get rid of him. No, not him. How do you plan to carry him? I couldn't lift him, and you're too weak to help. We'll wake him up and he'll walk. That's too dangerous. And you're too weak. Let's just leave him here. The fire will destroy everything. After years of struggle... I can't leave him here. He's mine now. I'll take him with me. He's mine. She's suffering from catalepsy. - Doctor? - Come in, Leblanc. I've decided to give her shock treatment right away. It can't wait. Go. What's going on? What's wrong? I call upon Satan... do not allow this experiment to end. That's the only explanation I can give you without an in-depth examination. It is hard to believe, but the person you brought here was already dead. Take a look at the results. Her movements seemed to be guided by some unknown force. The trance only appeared when the flux keeping her quasi-alive disappeared. The shock treatment was crucial, even though I can't say for certain. This case is fascinating. Tomorrow, my colleagues and I will start... an in-depth study of her remains. Who knows? We might discover what happened thanks to our research. Research? The professor's research. Susanne. She might be in danger. Later. Let's go. If I'm right, we'll get there in time. And we'll shed light on the duke's death. Inspector. Don't shoot. Be careful with the girl. Look out. Don't look at him, Susanne.
