Subtitles by explosiveskull Hi, and thank you for joining me for another spiritually uplifting episode of Hope Inside You. I'm your hostess, Hope Matthews. Today, I'd like to ask everyone a few questions. Are you awakened? Are you enlightened? Do you truly feel happy? If you could take happiness and ball it up with water, would you drink it? Do you feel the power of enlightenment? You know, when I was a little girl, I grew up across the street in this field of wild flowers. In the spring time, when these flowers have bloom, I would get lost for hours. Our mind can kinda be like the field of wild flowers, can it? We can get lost sometimes, don't we? It's easy. I want you to close your eyes for a moment. Imagine you're in the field of wild flowers. Then guess what. Open your eyes. You're not alone. Take my hand. Oh, I didn't hear you come in. How was your day? I've been better. Anything you wanna talk about? No. You can tell me anything, you know. Yeah, I know. I know. ? Hush and bye ? Don't you cry ? Don't you cry, little baby ? You shall have ? You shall have, little baby ? A coach and six ? A coach and six ? A coach and six little horses ? ? Black and a bay ? A brown and a gray ? All of the pretty little baby ? As the teacher begin the instruction in reading, she knows that experience is an understanding must precede the printed word and its comprehension. She recognizes the action before the word, the idea or reading readiness then reading. Before the worthy idea, simply means that the child must first gain understandings about real things. Later, the child can associate appropriate understandings with the words or phrases that stand before them. The teacher explains this process as we see, we learn. We read. Dad. Yes? Where do babies come from anyhow? Why, the mothers bring them into the world. By why do mothers bring them? Johnny, by the grace of heaven, mothers are the only ones who know how to bring babies into world. That's right dad. Mothers do bring babies into the world. Daddy. Yes? Why do babies have fathers? There wouldn't be any babies without fathers. But why? Well, your child is inquisitive. This research study explains how film experiences may help students learn increased amount of new information which is remembered longer and which therefore may be applied efficiently to problem solving situations as pupils progress from lower to higher grade. This then is the story of reproduction. A story which any parent should fully understand. Not only to ensure the arrival of a healthy child but also... We think of using new communications devices. We have overloaded teacher and overloaded curricula. ? It's raining, it's pouring ? The old man is snoring ? He jumped to bed and bumped his head ? ? He didn't get up till morning ? Will you play round the clock with me? I don't know I have. Really? ? Round and round the garden ? Like the teddy get up ? One step, two step ? Tickle you under there Little more than the process of matching new experience with appropriate words. In the abdomen, there's no special structures except. I see you. I have something that I need to tell you. Hi, and welcome back for another episode of Hope Inside you. I'm Hope Matthews. You know, not too long ago, I somehow attracted and activated some unwanted vibrations to my life. But the most important part is being to able recognize that. Being able to put your fingers on the pulse of life. The answer is not to try, let go. No more struggle. You don't have to struggle to succeed. Claim the benefits of the universe. Look here. There's no scars on my wrist. I'm at one with life. And you wanna know what? I'm gonna bring you there with me, aren't I? Yes, yes I am. John! Please forgive me. I know you can hear me. Where do I know you from? Don't I know you? Do you hear that dog? Tucker. That's his name, Tucker. Where do I know you from? Ma, did you hear me knocking? See, you decided to sell the house, huh. One way, you're gonna tell me about this, Ma. Ma, I was just getting washed up. I'm gonna head on home now. Today, I'd like to talk with everyone about fear. How to fight it and how to let it go. First, I'd like to start with this story. Now this story, it took me many, many years to understand. I don't know if I truly understand the meaning of it, still. Hopefully you'll figure it out today. There once was lion who was searching the jungle for food. He searched for miles and miles and was beginning to go hungry. Then he came across a dear, who was already caught in a trap. The lion thought, if there was a way he could get inside the trap, he would have a much needed meal. So the lion did. He broke into the trap and ate the dear. When the lion tried to leave, he realized he was now also trapped. The lion waited there for several days. Then one day, a man approached the lion. Hey! I found this doll out in your yard, Ma. I just want you to know, I'm not mad at you. I know it's too much for you to handle anymore. Well, anyway. I just want you to know that I'm here for you no matter what. I still think you could've picked a better realtor than my brother though. I thought that I might find you here. You really shouldn't be walking around by yourself. Alright, I'll check on you tomorrow, Ma. Hello, and thank you for joining me for another episode of Hope Inside You. I'm Hope Matthews. Today, I'd like to do something a little different.
