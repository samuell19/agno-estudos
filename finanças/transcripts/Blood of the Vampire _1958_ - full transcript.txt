(Triumphant music) (church bells ringing) TRANSYLVANIA THE MOST LOATHSOME SCOURGE EVER TO AFFLICT THIS EARTH WAS THAT OF THE VAMPIRE. NOURISHING ITSELF ON WARM LIVING BLOOD, THE ONLY KNOWN METHOD OF ENDING A VAMPIRE'S REIGN OF TERROR WAS TO DRIVE A WOODEN STAKE THROUGH ITS HEART. (flesh drilling) (thudding) (dramatic music) (thudding) BLOOD OF THE VAMPIRE No! No! (screaming) (laughing) (upbeat music) (glass shattering) (giggling) What do you want? Come on, just like that. Go away! (grunting) All right. I'll come. I gotta go now. Business. But I'll be back later. (light suspenseful music) (howling) All right, all right, all right. (water bubbling) (dramatic music) First the money. No, no, no, I don't want those. I know what to do. We discussed together several times. Here, hold this. (light dramatic music) You haven't paid me enough for this. Do you hear me? I want more money. The authorities would pay well for the information I could give 'em. (dramatic music) (screaming) (bats screeching) CARLSTADT SIX YEARS LATER (muffled talking over each other) (gavel smacking) Doctor Pierre, have you anything to say before sentence is passed? I will say this, My Lord. All I did was to try to save the life of my patient. Had the members of the medical council shown any competence in their task, they would have realised that death was inevitable and in no way caused by my actions. May I ask the court once more to contact Professor Bernard Meinster of Geneva? He knew my work and will tell the court that what I did was justified. That is all I have to say. You have said nothing that you have not already said during the course of this trial. However, to put your mind at rest on one point, the court took the liberty of writing to Professor Meinster and placing before him the facts of this case. I have here his reply. "Your Honour, I know nothing of the man "who calls himself John Pierre "and I feel bound to condemn most severely "his actions in this matter. "And express the hope that the law will deal with him "in the fullest severity." (audience muffled talking) John Pierre, you have been found guilty of malpractice leading to murder. The sentence of this court is that you be confined to the penal institution on Cambode Island for the remainder of your natural life. (audience talking over each other) (smacking) The court is adjourned. Uncle, I must do something to help. Yes, dear. We will. (muffled woman singing) A thousand days of singing Girls all lay below Oh, don't deceive me I'll never leave thee I'll come to see you in some form Late and old (humming) Gettin' pushy in here, are we? Ladi da, I called it. - Come on. - Get away. This your tea, Your Lordship? This little chip doesn't care to partake. The prisoner Pierre. There's a visitor for you. His Lordship has a visitor. In here. But I can't see anyone in here. In here or not at all. This way, miss. Oh, John. You shouldn't of come here, Madeleine. I had to see you. John, why did this have to happen? We would be married next week, everything... It'll be all right, you'll see. I'm leaving for Geneva to see Meinster. Good. That letter needs some explanation. He'd never have written like that. I'll find out, I promise. Aren't you gonna introduce us, Your Lordship? You can't keep a good thing like this to yourself. You'd better go, my dear. What's the matter, Your Lordship? Forgotten your manners? (chuckling) Come on. Isn't she lovely, eh? Oh yeah. (cell clanking) Your Lordship. What's she give ya? Let's have a look. Oh, His Lordship don't wanna show us his pretty little gee-gor. Well, perhaps we'd have to take it off him. (smacking) Oh! (dramatic music) (clanking) Other hand. Leave that. The prisoner Pierre, free the legs, leave the hands. Depart for Cambold Island to remain here. Prisoner Pierre to come with me. Where are you taking me? Something special for you, Pierre. Something very special. Here's your prisoner. (thudding) (carriage rumbling) (dramatic music) (thunder booming) (bridge creaking) (dogs barking) Out. Take your time. Inside. Are you a doctor? When I talk to you answer me, do ya hear? Yes, I'm a doctor. (barking) In case you ever think of leaving us. Come on. Get in. What's this? Prisoner's aren't allowed personal possessions! (thudding) (slamming) (gasping) All right, all right, friend. He's gone. Who was this? Wetzler, he's the head warden. I don't imagine I'm going to like him. Believe it or not, friend, he's the least of the egos you'll have to contend with here. You can curse the fates that sent you here. This is the abyss, a bottomless pit of hell itself. (light dramatic music) (people talking over each other) [Guard] Come on. Wetzler! (laughing) (screaming) Come. What's all the noise about? It's the unfortunate super various reasons aren't going to get any breakfast. It's a punishment. Starvation? One of the minor punishments. [Guard] Here. You better stand away from that door unless you want another crack of a skull. You're not hungry this morning? Well, we shan't waste this good food. Eat well. I have some work for you to do later. (barking) Start digging. Not too deep or you'll disturb the present occupant. (laughing) Who's dead? Nobody yet. Then what... (hushes) (thudding) This man's too ill to work. - Who says so? - I say so. You're not a doctor now, my friend, you're a prisoner. Get back to your work. I tell you, he's... (barking) Up. Get up, I said. We'll see if that dog can move you. (church bell ringing) It's Dr. Callistratus. Who is that? Callistratus. Who is he? You'll find out, friend. [Guard] Stop talking. (dramatic music) I was willing to swear that that man couldn't raise a finger. Even the threat of the dog wouldn't move him. - Then this... - Callistratus. Yes, he arrives. And the man finds the strength not only to get to his feet again but to do the work with the strength of two men. - Fear. - I know. But what sort of fear can inspire those reactions? Look, friend, there are no words to describe the horror of that name. What you learn about Callistratus you've got to learn for yourself, you can't be taught. Enough that he's in complete charge here. Our absolute lord and master. Soon you'll see what that phrase can mean. As the grave we dug this morning. But you said no one was dead. (screaming) (thudding) There's your claimant for the grave tomorrow. At least what'll be left of him. This is the year 1880, not the Middle Ages. This is a prison for the criminally insane. Whose families and friends have forgotten. My friends haven't forgotten. There was certain evidence at the trial that did not come to light. They won't be able to help you, no one can. Why do you say that? 'Cause once a man sets foot in this place he never leaves. You know why I'm here? My wife who's very beautiful, too beautiful. There was a man who wanted her for himself. He was the mayor of the village in which I lived. He was super influent. One night in a tavern I quarrelled with a man and later they found his body with my knife stuck in his back. I didn't have a chance. The rest you know. I'm here and my wife... I'm sorry, Kurt. There's no help. At least not from the outside. What do you mean? When you realise that no one can help you perhaps then you and I can help each other. (dramatic music) Out. Not you, just Pierre. Where are you taking me? To Dr. Callistratus. Over here. (knocking on door) Enter. I am Dr. Callistratus. You're perhaps wondering why you've been sent here. Your original destination was to be Cambold Island, I believe. You're here because I sent for you. It's the prerogative of those of us in charge of prisons to ask for any prisoner whom we consider would benefit at our own particular establishment. Now I read the reports of your trial. I think you come into that category. Will you follow me, please? (water bubbling) This is my laboratory. This is where you will work. Work? You were confined to prison for attempting to do something that no one has ever done before. Transfused blood from one being to another. Now you must've believed in what you were trying to do. I, too, believe it can be done. Here we shall attempt to do it together. Do I understand that you want me to work on medical research? If you so choose you can sit in your cell and rot. But I don't think you will. No, no I won't. Good, good. Now tell me, in your work with blood what did you discover about the groupings? Only that there were different types of blood, very little else. Did you not discover that to inject one type of blood into a body bearing a different type could be dangerous? Even fatal? It might cost. That is why all species of blood must be classified so that the same mistake is not made again. Now here we have two entirely different blood groups. For want of a better name I'm calling them Group A and Group B. I want you to observe the different blood structure of both of these groups. Yes, I see the difference. And now I'm going to add more of the Group A blood onto the A slide. Will you observe the affect? You see, they mix quite naturally. Well now I'm going to add some of the Group A specimen onto the other slide. Now will you tell me what you see? The groups do not mix, they seem to be fighting on another. They will destroy each other. The same thing could happen in a human body. So the first phase of your work will be to classify and to learn the various blood groups. Where do I obtain them? There are enough prisoners in this establishment to give you all the specimens you require. And the second phase? The isolation of a rare and dangerous blood condition. You'll learn about that when your first work is completed. I see. Meantime, you're still a prisoner. You will not be allowed to leave here, but inside you will have freedom of movement. Thank you. Here are some of my research notes, will you study them? Oh, one other thing. Your work will bring you in contact with many of the prisoners. You'll hear many strange and fantastic stories. Perhaps you already have. Remember, Pierre, you are in an institution for the insane. The criminally insane. Three quarters of what is said here can be completely discounted as the raving of imbeciles. Carl will show you to your room. Carl. You will remain there today, tomorrow we start work together. And Carl, will you get those manacles removed? Let me have him back now. I have some work for him to do. Well, when? A prisoner with privileges? I never thought I'd see that in this place. Watch your step here. One day you'll slip up and I'll be looking after you again. Don't you touch me, you dirty little ape. Carl! Wetzler! I want the prisoner's manacles removed. (light suspenseful music) Thank you, Carl. (groaning) Is the patient ready? No! Don't! Please! Leave me alone. Soon, Carl, I should be able to dispense with the blood of others. With Pierre helping me, the solution of my problem will be much quicker, easier. (light footsteps) (woman screaming) What are you doing here? Oh, I'm sorry, Dr. When you first came here as my housekeeper I warned you to confine yourself to my living quarters. You chose to ignore my warning and to pry into matters which do not concern you. Now that you are here you must pay the forfeit for your curiosity. Carl will see that you're taken care of. Oh no, please, Dr. I won't say a word to anyone. I promise you! Carl, take her away. No! No! (screaming) Don't! No! Since you're so interested in my work there's no reason why you should not assist me. My experiments so far have been confined to male blood groups. I think the time has come to extend my activity. As soon as this young lady told me what had happened I came at once. And you say you never received this letter from the court at the time of the trial? If I had I would have come immediately. You know that, my dear. So this letter, purporting to be form you, was, in fact, a forgery? It must to be. I see. Well, in the light of these facts you've laid before me, Professor Meinster, I shall review the case. (bell dinging) Then perhaps we can take steps to discover who perpetrated this deception and with what reason in mind. (door clicking) Ah, Auron. This is Monsieur Auron of the prison commission. Auron, I'm going to review the case of one John Pierre at the request of Mademoiselle Duval. Notify the commission immediately. Yes. That is all I can do, my dear. Thank you. Thank you, sir. (glass shattering) I'm sorry, it's the last one. I'd have to get another from the laboratory. Can't it wait? Dr. Callistratus said he wanted blood samples from everyone on this block. You go, I'll wait here. I'll be back in a minute. - Hello, Kurt. - John! John, for heaven's sake, I thought you, I thought... That I was dead? It's been over a week since they came for you, - what's happened to you? - I work here now. What do you mean you work here? Callistratus found out that I was a doctor. I'm helping him. I've come to take a blood sample. Not from me you won't. It's only a sample I want, I've taken one from every prisoner here. I'm not going to be dragged down to that laboratory and experimented on. What is it about the laboratory that frightens you? What about the room below the laboratory? What about the ones that go in there? You saw that man dragged off that time. He died of a heart attack. Haha, who told you that, your doctor friend? I saw two of the men who were detailed to bury him. They told me his entire body had been slit open and there was nothing left of it. He may have performed an autopsy. It's not unusual in the case of sudden deaths... Another thing. All the blood had been drained out of his body, he was only just skin and bone. Ask your doctor friend to explain that. And ask him about the man last week. The one we had to bury without his head. I was on that burying party myself. Quick, let's go. Here you are. Be more careful in the future. It's all right, I've got what I want in here. (light dramatic music) Carl, fetch me down slide 34. Is the doctor down there? Let me pass, Carl. Carl, what's keeping you? (grunting) (thudding) What is the meaning of this? Since Carl's unable to, perhaps you will explain. I apologise, doctor. I merely wished to pass through the door. Carl tried to stop me. Is that right, Carl? Why did you wanna go through that door? I wanted to find out what is down there. That is no concern of yours. If I'm to assist you I should understand the full scope of your work. You will learn in good time. Meanwhile you'll please concentrate on the groupings. Carl, you may go. But remember, you will not leave that door open again. (lock clicking) Have you completed the groupings? Nearly, I only have to classify them. Good. Then you can start on the second phase of your work. Which is? You remember when you first came here I spoke of a blood condition which I was trying to isolate it? Yes. Now, this condition breaks down the living blood cells and forms a completely new group. The cells in this group cannot be mingled with any other group. But somewhere there must be a combination of groups that will not be antagonistic towards it. We must find that combination. How are you going to do that? Trial and error, a laborious task. The only way, I'm afraid. You've experimented before with this group? Naturally, why do you ask? On the prisoner who was taken from his cell the other night? Have you been listening to the ravings of those poor wretches and I warned you about that, Pierre, when you first came here. Don't tell me I have to warn you again. (knocking on door) Come in. Monsieur Auron's waiting to see you, sir. Thank you. You continue with the classification. I'll return soon. Auron. [Auron] Good morning, Callistratus. You here in your capacity of Inspector of Prisons or is it purely a social call? A little of both. Firstly, the commission are getting disturbed at the number of deaths at this establishment. You must do something to cover it up, Callistratus. The commission will be bound to take action otherwise. There is your problem. I pay you well to earn your money. I know, but you're making it extremely difficult for me. What is the other thing you wanted to talk to me about? The prisoner Pierre. He's to be released. Why? When? His case was reviewed. They found out that the letter he sent to, what's his name? - Meinster. - Yes. They found out that it never reached him. Meinster came to Carlstad himself. (grunting) This is unfortunate. If they were to ever find out that I intercepted the letter and replied to it myself I'd be finished. I forged Meinster's signature. This is most unfortunate. Something will have to be done. I knew you'd help me out. I only did it for you. When will the release order be through? A week, perhaps 10 days. Good. Good. That's all, thank you. [Auron] But what are you going to do? All in good time. Now, if there's nothing else, I have work to do. You'll excuse me. Will you tell Pierre I wish to see him? You won't forget what I told you about the deaths here. The commission are worried. The commission are always worried. Unless you want to meet Pierre I suggest that you wait for Carl in the next room. He'll see you out as soon as he's finished. I wish I knew what you intended to do. Good day. Come in, Pierre. I've just had a visitor, a member of the prison commission. Among other things, routine things, he brought up the matter of yourself. What did he say? He told me that in the light of new evidence your case has been reviewed. It's what I've been waiting for. He went on to say that the court could find no grounds to reverse their original decision. I don't understand. It grieves me to have to tell you this, Pierre, but your sentence must stand as passed. The court found there were no extenuating circumstances. But didn't Meinster testify? Didn't they get in touch with Meinster? I'm afraid I'm not aware of the details, I only know what I've been told. Of course I shall do all in my power to see that you continue your work here. That way your incarceration will weigh less heavily on you. That is all. Pierre, that is all. You may return to your room. You'll be excused work for the rest of the day. Pierre, will you help me, please? I must keep this man alive. Cardiac stimulant. It's nothing but a serious blood deficiency. How much have you given him? You must understand, Pierre, I'm not giving him any blood, I'm taking it from him. - How much have you taken? - Nearly two litres. You must be mad. I'm not interested in your opinion of me, I'm interested in keeping this man alive. The stimulant! You've gotta start a transfusion on this man immediately. Who are you telling me what I must do? Pierre! Wetzler! He's dead. It was to prevent death that I sent for you. You killed him, Callistratus. You murdered this man. And you ruined an important experiment which is infinitely worse. Wetzler. Pierre's returning to his room. Will you see that he gets there? (light dramatic music) (knocking on door) [John] Guard. Guard. What do you want? I want to go into the cell block - to see the prisoner Kurt Oreck. - Why? It's on the doctor's business. I know nothing of this. Perhaps you'd like me to wake him up so that he could tell you. No, wait, wait, wait, wait a minute. - Wake up. - (grunting) That plan of yours. The one you mentioned the night I arrived. - What plan? - I want to hear about it. I don't know what you're talking about. Look. I had to lie to get in here. I want to know what that plan is. Here you are, Callistratus' pet lap dog, trotting around doing his dirty work for him and you expect me to fall for it. Who put you up to it? Callistratus or Wetzler? I'm serious! Are you with me or do I have to try it alone? All right. Let's assume for one moment that you mean what you say. Why'd you change your mind? They reviewed my case. And the verdict stands? I warned you, friend, didn't I? Yes, you did. But you also said you knew a way we could break out. Now are you going to tell me what it is? All right. I'll tell you. (chains clanking) It cost more than one life to get these. This'll unlock the door at the cell and the door at the corridor. That's stage one, easy. Stage two is the difficult one. Getting across the compound to the wall. The dogs will have to be taken care of. That's where I need your help. I need some poison. Can you get any? I think so. Good. So this is what we do with it. I know the prisoner whose job it is to feed the dogs. Now, tomorrow night when we got the poison... I feel we've progressed well today, Pierre. I'm bound to admit you're a great help to me. Thank you, sir. (door slamming) (light dramatic music) (dogs barking) (howling) (chains jingling) [Pierre] Guard. [Guard] What do you want? I have something important to tell you. (dramatic music) (grunting) The guard, leave him! I'll fix the rope. Hurry. Kurt! Kurt! No! No! (dogs barking) (screaming) Wetzler was for letting you follow that man into the courtyard. Perhaps I should have let you. You knew! You could've stopped it. Yes, I could've stopped it. But sometimes it's necessary to have an example to show the imprudency of certain actions. Remember what has happened, John Pierre. Let it be a deterrent against further similar occurrences. I am sorry, my dear young lady. One more day and the release order will become official. Are you sure there couldn't of been some mistake? Quite sure. I have the report here from the governor of the prison. Pierre and another man were both killed while attempting to escape. Excuse me, can you tell me when Doc... Can you tell me when Dr. Callistratus will see me? I told him you were here, miss. He's busy at the moment, I'm afraid, but he won't be long. Thank you. (door clicking) Is the housekeeper's room ready? Prepare to take her there as soon as I've seen her. I'm sorry to have kept you waiting. The duties of the prison governor are long and sometimes arduous. I understand, sir. - Please sit down. - Thank you. Good. Now whilst I'm delighted at the choice of the prison commission in selecting you, I feel bound to admit that I doubt their wisdom. I'm sorry, sir, I don't understand. This is a prison. More than that, it's hardly the place for anyone so young and beautiful as yourself. But I was told by the commission that I shouldn't have to enter the prison. That is true. If I had known you would of been the choice I should have asked the commissioner to replace my housekeeper earlier. Much earlier. I shall try and do my best, sir. I'm sure you will. Now Carl will show you to your room. Carl, this is Mademoiselle Duval, the new housekeeper. He's my faithful servant, you can trust him. Sir, look at this. At last. Pierre, we've discovered that the destructive power of this group can be temporarily halted by normal transfusion. We're halfway to a permanent cure. If it's such a rare condition I don't see why we're bothering. After all, there are many more important things we could be working on. There's nothing more important, nothing. For six years I've been working on a cure for the evil degeneration of the blood cells. To suffer from this complacence must be the most terrible affliction of all time. What is it? Here, now? All right, tell him to wait, I'll see him later. After this discovery, Pierre, we should do no more work today. This card, the one for Kurt Oreck. What about it? Kurt was killed more than a week ago. I know that. There's an entry here on a blood classification dated yesterday. Nonsense. (dramatic music) Yes, you're right. Careless slip. I'll alter it. You return to your room. (light dramatic music) (clanking) (scratching) All right for you, Callistratus, you're not under constant... (thudding) What is it? John. John, my darling. I knew it couldn't be true when they said you were dead. - Who said that? - The prison commission. They said you were killed trying to escape the day before your release came through. My release, Meinster testified? So he was lying. - Who? - Callistratus. What are you doing here? I was sure you wouldn't try to escape when you knew I was going to see Meinster. I had to find out for myself what happened so Uncle Phillipe used his influence to get me this job as housekeeper. You mustn't stay here, not for a moment. If Callistratus finds out who you are. Tomorrow you must leave. Make some excuse, anything to get out of here, and go straight to the authorities, tell them what you know. They'll know what to do. (knocking on door) Oh. Very well, I'll come down immediately. (dramatic music) (barking) I tell you, this business of Pierre and the other man dying like that, it's going to cause a lot of questions. Perhaps the commission would rather I let them escape. You've had too many mysterious deaths here. Other prisons don't have this trouble. This is not like other prisons. (knocking on door) Come in. Oh, this is Mademoiselle Duval, my new housekeeper. Monsieur Auron. It's great pleasure, my dear young lady. Tell me, have we not met before? I don't think so, sir. Is there anything else you require, sir? That's all, thank you. You know, Callistratus, I'm sure I've seen her somewhere before. (dogs barking) - All quiet? - Dogs a bit restless. Open up, I'm going out. Give me your rifle and bayonet. - What for? - Hurry! (scraping) (creaking) (dramatic music) (clanking) (thudding) (grunting) (gun banging) (dogs barking) (knocking on door) Enter. - Well, what is it? - It's Wetzler, sir. He's dead. Where did this happen? At the burial ground. There was an open grave. I shall come and see. If you'll excuse me, Auron. Carl. Where's the housekeeper, Carl? I, too, shall retire. I've had a long day. Tell the doctor when he returns. (light music) What are you doing here? Come, my dear, it's not as though we're complete strangers. Or had you forgotten our previous meeting? I don't know what you're talking about. No? If you don't leave I shall call Dr. Callistratus. Please do, I'm sure he'd be delighted to know that we had met before. Where was it? In the Chief Justice's office if I remember correctly. Now, will you call him or shall I? No. No, don't call him. Of course not. So much nicer with just the two of us here, isn't it? I brought you some wine. I thought we might drink a toast together to our friendship. You're very beautiful, my dear. Much too beautiful to remain in a place like this. Such fair skin, so smooth, soft. (dramatic music) (frantic breathing) Carl. (groaning) Carl. Carl, explain. It's not Carl's fault, he was helping me. Auron came in here and tried to force himself on me. - Thank Carl... - She's lying. I came here to find out where I'd seen her before and I'll tell you; in the Chief Justice's office. Go on, ask her what she was doing there. You're the one that's lying. She's trying to trick you, Callistratus. - They sent her here to find... - Get out, Auron. - I tell you, she's... - Get out. I'm leaving but you haven't heard the last of this. I've done enough covering up for you. Now I'm going to make a full report to the prison commission on the work you're doing here. Release him. Carl. The gentleman is leaving. My dear young lady, how can I apologise for this unfortunate incident? Thank you, Doctor, but it's all right now. Yes, my dear, it's all right. You sent for me, sir? Yes, will you come over here please? I must apologise for this late summons but Auron's stupidity has forced me to come to certain decisions. I'm afraid there's no time to lose. Will you come with me please? Through here. This is my other laboratory. Only Carl and myself have ever been down here before. The practical sight of my work distresses you? Come, let me explain. This is a little experiment of mine to determine the affects of deep freezing on the human body. This man is being kept alive artificially. He has no heart. I recreated mechanically the stimulus provided by the heart beat. Here is heart for which he had no further use so I borrowed it, shall we say. More important, someone who knew you. Knew you very well. (dramatic music) (gasping) (tapping) John. John. (clanking) John. Don't worry, the young lady is not leaving. Carl, fetch that crowbar and bring it here. Do as I say, Carl! (clanking) Now chain Pierre to the wall. And remember this gun is trained on both of you. Get the operating table ready. I hope you approve of my real workshop. As a fellow doctor you'd of enjoyed some of my experiments. The girl, Carl. Carl. The girl, strap her to the table. Do as I say, Carl. Very well, I shall deal with you later. Leave the laboratory. What I'm doing is no concern of yours. Now leave! (gun clicking) Carl, stay where you are. (gun banging) (thudding) And now to put our theory into practise. We shall soon see whether all my work has been in vain. With the aid of Mademoiselle Duval here, I'm going to transfer the blood stream from one living person into another. This will make you sleep, my deal, you will feel nothing. (grunting) [John] Callistratus, leave her alone! If you must experiment on someone, why not me? Why not me, Callistratus? (chains jingling) Once I was a doctor like yourself. And like yourself, I experimented with conditions of the blood. They called me a vampire. Sentenced me to die, to be impaled with a stake. But during my work I discovered and isolated a culture which allowed life to remain dormant in me although my heart had been damaged. So after my execution, Carl, with the aid of a drunken doctor, resurrected me. I changed my name and started life afresh. But this culture proved a double-edged weapon. It saved me from an early grave but it created an infection in me in which one group of cells in my body is destroying the other. Kurt here has proved an ideal companion. At last, he will have some company. Kurt. Kurt doesn't talk. He doesn't even move about. He just stays where he is without complaining. Don't you, Kurt? I'm not sure he even understands what's been said to him. And I say I performed a miracle of surgery in keeping him alive. The dogs were particularly savage that night. Kurt has been infected with the same disease that I am suffering from. In a concentrated form, of course. Now, I intend to take Kurt's blood from him and substitute fresh clean blood. If Kurt survives the experiment I shall of succeeded. Kurt. Can you hear me? Kurt! This is John Pierre. You mustn't let him do this, you must stop him! Don't let him, Kurt. You must stop him! Don't bother yourself, Pierre. I don't suppose he can even understand you. Now, Kurt, now! (light dramatic music) Apparently he does understand you. Kurt. Kurt, let go of my arm. Kurt. Kurt, let go of my arm. Kurt! Kurt, let go of my arm! Kurt! Let! Kurt, let go of my arm! Kurt, let go of my arm! Let go of my... (gagging) (thudding) Wake up, Madeleine, wake up. Wake up! Madeleine! It's all right, please. We'll be all right. Callistratus, get up. We're leaving here. You'll give us safe conduct as far as the main gate, is that understood?
