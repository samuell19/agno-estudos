LIKE A MAN WITHOUT A DICK. DULL. COME ON, DON’T BE FUNNY. I’M SERIOUS. WELL, IT AIN’T LIKE ANY PLACE OR ANYTHING. IT’S-- IT’S LIKE-- YOU KNOW THAT FEELING YOU GET SOMETIMES WHEN YOU’RE SINKING TO THE BOTTOM OF THE COLDEST OCEAN AND YOU’RE ALL ALONE, SUFFOCATING, A MILLION POUNDS PUSHIN’ ON EVERY SQUARE INCH OF YOUR BODY? WELL, SOMEONE FOUND A WAY TO TAKE THAT FEELING AND TURN IT INTO A PLACE, AND THAT’S WHAT THAT INSTITUTION’S LIKE. [hammer pounding] OH, I DON’T NEED THAT YET. YOU COULD BRACE THIS FOR ME, THOUGH.

ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS PUT THE NAIL IN, AND YOU JUST-- SHIT! SHIT! SHIT! YOU HIT THE GODDAMN NAIL IN A STRAIGHT LINE! I’M JUST NO GOOD AT IT. I GUESS YOU NEVER DID MUCH OF THIS KIND OF WORK GROWING UP, DID YOU? SURE, I DID. I WAS BUILDING THINGS ALL THE TIME WHEN I WAS A KID. IT’S JUST, OF COURSE, NOW, WITH THE BUSINESS THE WAY IT IS-- OH, I WASN’T INSINUATING ANYTHING ABOUT IT. IT’S JUST THAT WHEN A GUY GROWS UP IN A WEALTHY FAMILY, HE USUALLY DOESN’T GET TO DO THE KIND OF THINGS THAT MEN USUALLY DO. YOU REMEMBER VISITING ME WHEN WE WERE KIDS? YEAH, AND I REMEMBER PLAYING OLD MAID IN A PARLOR A HELL OF A LOT MORE THAN I DO PLAYING COWBOYS AND INDIANS IN THE WOODS. NOW, WHY DON’T YOU JUST ADMIT IT, ZACH? YOU’RE JEALOUS, AND YOU’VE ALWAYS BEEN JEALOUS EVER SINCE MY DADDY STRUCK OIL ON HIS LAND. HIS LAND? WELL, HERE WE GO. NOW WE SEE IT ALL CLEAR AS DAY. YOU STILL GOT THAT STUCK IN YOUR CRAW, DON’T YOU? MY DADDY BOUGHT THAT LAND FROM OLD SPARTA FAIR AND SQUARE. AND HE STRUCK OIL ON IT A WEEK LATER. DID IT EVER OCCUR TO YOU THAT MAYBE YOUR PA WAS SO HELL-BENT ON WASTING HIS LIFE WITH A STUPID DREAM OF A-- A CAMEL DYNASTY THAT MY DADDY WAS FORCED TO GO OFF ON HIS OWN?! NOW, MY DADDY TRIED FOR YEARS TO GET OLD SPARTA TO DRILL FOR OIL, BUT SPARTA WAS TOO DAMN STUBBORN. THAT WASN’T THE WAY IT GOT TOLD TO ME. BESIDES, THAT WASN’T THE POINT. I WAS JUST COMPARING OUR UPBRINGINGS. NO, YOU WEREN’T. NO, YOU WEREN’T. GOD DAMN IT, YOU WERE CALLIN’ ME A SISSY. THAT’S WHAT YOU WERE DOIN’. THE HELL I WAS! THE HELL YOU WEREN’T! MAYBE I DON’T KNOW HOW TO RIDE A HORSE. MAYBE I’VE NEVER BEEN IN A REAL FIGHT, BUT THAT DON’T MAKE ME LESS OF A MAN THAN YOU, ZACH WHIT! YOU AIN’T NEVER BEEN IN A REAL FIGHT? BY JESUS, BUT I TELL YOU WHAT. I TELL YOU WHAT, ZACH-- I’M SORELY TEMPTED RIGHT NOW. OH, NOW, EASY, NOW, CLINTON. JUST SETTLE DOWN HERE. COME ON, I’M GONNA PROVE IT TO YOU. WHAT? COME ON, I’M GONNA SHOW YOU WHAT I GOT. COME ON. LET’S PLAY TOE TICKLER. TOE TICKLER? YEAH, THAT’S RIGHT. CLINTON, WE’RE GROWN MEN HERE. NOW, WHY DON’T WE BOTH JUST CALM DOWN AND FINISH BUILDING THIS COFFIN FOR ROBERT E.? WELL, I KNEW YOU WAS TOO YELLOW TO DO IT. ALL RIGHT. LET’S TICKLE THEM TOES. [owl hooting] (Walter) SO THIS IS WHERE THE WHITS END UP, HUH? (Miranda) NOT ALL OF THEM. THERE SHOULD BE ONE MORE, ONE MORE SMALL GRAVE... FOR MY BABY. YOUR BABY? WELL, IT WASN’T A REAL BABY. IT WAS KIND OF A BABY-TO-BE. YOU SEE, HIS FATHER WAS A CHEROKEE BRAVE, AND DADDY JUST WOULDN’T LET ME MARRY HIM. HE WOULDN’T HAVE NO HALF-BREED GRANDCHILD OUT OF WEDLOCK, SO I WENT AND GAVE MYSELF AN ABORTION. FUNNY, I THOUGHT THAT WOULD MAKE DADDY HAPPY, BUT AFTER THAT, HE JUST KIND OF FROZE UP ON ME. HE PLANTED THAT TREE IN THE BACKYARD IN THE BABY’S MEMORY. NOT LONG AFTER THAT-- I COULDN’T TELL YOU HOW LONG-- I FOUND MYSELF IN THE SANITARIUM. JUST WHEN I THINK I’M GETTING BETTER, I GO HOME, I SEE THAT TREE, AND SUDDENLY, I’M SINKING TO THE BOTTOM OF THE OCEAN AGAIN. [sighs] SOUNDS TO ME LIKE THAT TREE GOT A HAINT ON IT. [scoffs] IF I WERE YOU, I’D... I’D CUT THE DANG THING DOWN. LESS THAN THIS IF YOU WANT TO WIN. [thumps] WELL, YOU’RE LUCKY. IT’S JUST A PIECE OF YOUR TOE, NO STITCHES. I’LL SEE IF I CAN’T DIG UP A FIRST AID KIT. TRUNK OF MY CADDY. HERE ARE THE KEYS. ALL RIGHT, BE BACK IN NO TIME. YOU WANT TO EXPLAIN THIS, CLINTON? (Clinton) THIS IS MY HOME. WELL, THIS IS WHERE CHARLOTTE AND I LIVE. I GOT NOTHING. WELL, WHAT ABOUT THEM OIL RIGS OUT THERE? YOU EVER SEE THEM PUMPING? THE DAMN THINGS DRIED UP ON ME. I JUST CAN’T BELIEVE THIS, CLINTON. [laughs] I HAVE A HARD TIME BELIEVING IT MYSELF. NO SAVINGS? STOCK MARKET. LOST EVERYTHING TRYING TO WIN IT BACK. YOU GOT ENOUGH TO LIVE? YEAH, WELL, NOT COUNTING WHAT I LOST TO YOU SHOOTING, I GOT PROBABLY A WEEK TILL TUESDAY. WE WERE HOPING OLD SPARTA WOULD, YOU KNOW, LEAVE US SOMETHING IN HIS WILL, BUT, YOU KNOW, IT JUST WASN’T MEANT TO BE, SO... AT LEAST YOU DON’T HAVE ANY KIDS TO FEED. YEAH, I GUESS WE CAN BE THANKFUL FOR THAT. I AIN’T GONNA TELL ANYBODY ABOUT THIS, CLINTON, NOT EVEN MARY JOAN. WELL, I APPRECIATE THAT, ZACH. WELL, LET’S WRAP THAT UP AND FINISH THAT COFFIN, MR. TOE-TICKLING CHAMPION. COME ON, GIMPY. IF WE GET DRUNK NOW, WE CAN STILL BE SOBER IN TIME TO TAKE CARE OF ROBERT E. [laughs] [saw scraping] HEY, DON’T YOU THINK 6:00 IN THE MORNING IS A LITTLE EARLY FOR PRUNING? YOU KNOW, CUTTING IT DOWN IS NOT GONNA CHANGE ANYTHING. YOU MEAN, IT WON’T CHANGE ANYTHING FOR YOU, BUT FOR ME, IT’S GONNA DO A WORLD OF GOOD. JUST OUT OF CURIOSITY, MARY JOAN, WHEN ARE YOU GONNA FORGIVE ME? I CAN’T FORGIVE YOU. ONLY GOD CAN DO THAT. I’M NOT TALKING ABOUT THE BABY. I WANT TO KNOW WHEN YOU’RE GONNA FORGIVE ME FOR MY REAL SIN. YOU’RE NOT MAKING ANY SENSE. NOW, COME ON IN THE HOUSE AND GET SOME SLEEP. YOU’VE ALWAYS HATED ME, LONG BEFORE THE ABORTION. DON’T WASTE OUR TIME DENYING IT. ALL RIGHT, YOU’RE NOT MY TYPE. AND WHY IS IT, EXACTLY, YOU THINK THAT IS, THAT YOU DON’T LIKE ME? MIRANDA, I DON’T KNOW. IT’S NOT SOMETHING CONCRETE THAT I CAN PUT MY FINGER ON RIGHT NOW. ’CAUSE I WAS SO PRETTY. THAT’S MY SIN, AND THAT MADE YOU JEALOUS, ’CAUSE ALL YOUR LIFE, YOU PLAYED BY THE RULES, BUT ON A HOT SUMMER NIGHT, THE BOYS DIDN’T EXACTLY GO LOOKING FOR NICE GIRLS. WELL, MARY JOAN, MAYBE IT SEEMS TO YOU THAT I HAVE DANCED WITH THE SERPENT, THAT I HAVE OFFENDED THE MORAL CODE AND SANCTITY OF THIS GODFORSAKEN STRETCH OF PRAIRIE, BUT I HAVE PAID A VERY HIGH PRICE FOR WHATEVER I’M SUPPOSED TO HAVE DONE TO Y’ALL, AND MAYBE THAT AIN’T GOOD ENOUGH FOR YOU. MAYBE YOU WANT ME TO TAKE MY LIFE TO ATONE FOR TAKING THAT INDIAN BOY’S SEED. WELL, I’LL LOOK YOU STRAIGHT IN THE EYE, AND I’LL TELL YOU I WILL NOT SPEND THE REST OF MY LIFE ROTTING AWAY IN THAT ASYLUM, WAITING FOR YOUR FORGIVENESS. SO THAT TREE IS COMING DOWN, AND I’M GONNA PULL OUT ANYTHING BAD THAT’S GROWN IN MY HEART UNTIL I’M ABLE TO COME OUT AND START LIVING AGAIN. YOU GIVE ME THAT SAW. I DON’T THINK SO. I SAID GIVE IT TO ME-- YOU GIVE-- OH! I ONLY GIVE THINGS UP TO BOYS, MARY JOAN, DON’T YOU KNOW? YOU WANT IT? YOU TAKE IT, OKAY, HONEY? THESE ARE MY NEW SLIPPERS. NOW, YOU GO AHEAD AND GIVE IT TO ME. YOU’RE BEHAVING LIKE A CHILD, AND YOU’RE GONNA GET HURT. YES, I AM. MIRANDA, GIVE ME THE SAW. I’M LIKE ONE OF THOSE SAVAGES YOU SEE IN THE NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC. YOU WANT TO COMMUNICATE WITH ME? THEN YOU’VE GOT TO DESCEND TO MY PRIMITIVE, CARNAL, SINFUL LEVEL. UHH! AAH! [both screaming] OH, LORD. MIRANDA, MARY JOAN! OHH! [gasps] [grunting] [laughs] [laughter] [sobbing] (Mary Joan) MIRANDA, WHAT IS IT? I DIDN’T HAVE ANY ABORTION. BUT I ABORTED MY BABY... IN HERE. IN HERE, I ABORTED MY BABY. I PLANNED ON GOING TO THE CITY AND HAVING IT DONE, ONLY GOD BEAT ME TO IT. IT JUST FLOWED OUT OF ME. PART OF ME DIED, AND IT HURT. IT HURT LIKE I’VE NEVER, EVER BEEN HURT. MIRANDA, WHY WOULD YOU SAY THAT YOU HAD AN ABORTION WHEN YOU HAD A MISCARRIAGE? BECAUSE I DIDN’T. IN MY HEART, I KILLED MY BABY. THAT’S WHY GOD TOOK HIM. WE CAN’T LIE TO GOD. YOU WOULDN’T UNDERSTAND, MARY JOAN. YOU JUST WOULDN’T UNDERSTAND. I TRIED TO HOLD IT. I JUST KEPT WONDERING IF GOD WAS PUNISHING ME, PUNISHING ME FOR LOVING THAT BOY, FOR GIVING HIM ALL THE LOVE I HAD. HE’S NOT PUNISHING YOU, MIRANDA. AND IF HE IS, WELL... THEN HE’S AN ASSHOLE. OH, LORD. AM I GONNA GO TO HELL FOR SAYING THAT? ONLY IF GOD REALLY IS AN ASSHOLE, HONEY. [laughter] COME ON. 12? 12, MY BUTT. SWEAR TO GOD. MY BUTT. SWEAR TO GOD. GOD. WELL...
