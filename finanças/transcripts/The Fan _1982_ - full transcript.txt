No letter today I wrote R three weeks ago And still no answer Maybe he didn't get my letter Maybe some jealous secretary threw it away Because she knows I love R more she does That I really love R It would be a betrayal if I stopped waiting for his letters I won't go to school today I'll walk around town i imagined that R visited me here in Ulm We climbed the hundreds of steps up the cathedral One of the most beautiful moments of my life At the top, R gently takes me into his arms I shiver with excitement He is very gentle His lips touch mine... and I feel the tip of his tongue Some people gave me funny looks Tourists Perhaps they thought I was about to climb the bars and throw myself off And they were right That's what I'll do if I don't hear from R But I won't just be dead... splattered all across the square if I jump, I'll have a farewell letter to R with me Then R will hear of me He'll have to think about me And so I'll be a part of him and he a part of me I'm listening to his last album It's beautiful More than you can imagine It's like he wrote every song for me Like... he knew me inside out Like I knew him inside out I understand him And he understands me Like we'd known each other forever... but a cruel fate prevented us from really meeting It's not what you think. A letter from school to your parents Give me that! My parents say sorry but they can't see you today I'm getting a doctor's note soon I'm having very bad periods I was in school today I thought I could resist going home But I couldn't stop thinking about R Tell me, are you nuts? It's not there He always sings with the same voice But for me, his voice is different every time i imagine that's what it's like, being with the right person You say the same things but it's not the same It's not the words you use but what you mean that counts Because you might not be able to say what you mean And this is what I wrote in my letter to R: I know I can make you happy. And I know you can make me happy To give our happiness a chance, write to me... ...or give me a sign on your next show Wink once with your right eye, and I'll know you're thinking of me I don't care if I see pictures of R with other girls He doesn't look happy in those pictures I'm not jealous of those others All they want from him is his money That's why he's not interested He goes to bed with them, then kicks them out Maybe he even pays them, so they know what he thinks of them Today, is R's first TV appearance since I wrote him I can't wait to see if he makes our secret sign If he winks at me I'm sure he will Some... Some stupid show host offered me 1000 marks Well... I didn't get away unscathed either It's also said that... You know what... I'm going to watch the movie I want to watch this. I've been looking forward to it I don't know what's coming. But you'll have to bleed for it Is this any good? Quite good But I think I've seen it Maybe we can watch the show Auf Los Geht's Los, 7570 Baden-Baden 100 And now... ...good luck Talking of which... we have many stars... but real, international stars you can count on one hand A star of today, maybe an international star of tomorrow... who is forging a career with many notes, but only one letter... With the letter R What R stands for, we don't know. But maybe it stands for... Let's hope so... Here is R...! A moment... Life is just a moment Just a moment... And then it's all over A moment I live just for that moment Just for that female moment... Enough of this crap! Dear R... I don't know if you got my letters I know you can't read all the letters you get I don't even know if you wrote back I think the postman might have kept the letter from me for some reason Or my mother has it I don't know if you winked at me in the show either I couldn't watch it all, because I had an argument with my parents So I'm writing it all again to you one more time Perhaps you're waiting to hear back from me... and don't know I haven't heard from you yet If you already have my letter, start reading after the big heart I want to tell you that I love you And that I know I can make you happy You don't know me... but I've known you for 2 years now And I feel I could give your life meaning You would never be alone again You needn't worry that I'm after your money or your fame I would love and stand by you even if you were poor and unknown You're such a good person... yet I often see in your pictures the sadness behind your smile Write to me at the post office addressed to my first name To Simone Just write the word "Come"... then I'll know And we won't have to fear anyone finding out... or any problems if the letter gets into the wrong hands I'll go there every day to ask if a letter's come Please answer this as soon as you get it I can't live without you Good to see you What have you been up to? - Let's go for a coffee - Some other time - I've missed you - Ciao All for R?
