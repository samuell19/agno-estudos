Signs of cancer are already present, but he doesn't know that yet. PUBLIC AFFAIRS SECTION CHIEF The water gives my child rashes. WHERE CITIZENS AND CITY HALL MEET PLEASE DON'T HESITATE TO SUBMIT And it breeds mosquitoes. YOUR COMPLAINTS AND REQUESTS HERE Can't you do something? It would make a great playground if you filled it in. Just a moment, please. Sir, they've come to complain about open sewage. Send them to Public Works. Here's our protagonist. But what a bore it would be to describe his life now. Why? Because he's only killing time. He's never actually lived. You can't call this living. Miss Odagiri... how dare you, during business hours? It's just so funny! What is? The “Liar's Club.” Someone sent it around. Read it to us. “So you've never taken a vacation?” “That's right.” “Because City Hall can't run without you?” “No, because everyone would realize City Hall doesn't need me at all.” This isn't even worth watching. He might as well be a corpse. In fact, he's been dead for some 20 years now. Before that, he had some life in him. He even tried to do a little real work. PROPOSAL FOR INCREASING DEPARTMENTAL EFFICIENCY SUBMITTED 11/7/1930 BY KANJI WATANABE But there's nothing left of that will or passion. They've been completely worn down by the minutia of the bureaucratic machine and the meaningless busyness it breeds. Busy... so terribly busy. But in reality, he does nothing at all besides protecting his own position. The best way to protect your place in this world is to do nothing at all. But is this enough? Is this really enough? For him to start thinking seriously about this, his stomach will have to get a lot worse, and he'll have to rack up a lot more wasted time. But any proposal for creating a park must go to the Parks Department. This seems to be more a matter of sanitation. Talk to your district health center. See the Sanitation Department. See Environmental Sanitation. Preventive Sanitation. Disease Control. Lots of mosquitoes? That's a job for Pest Control. The problem is seeping waste, which means... it's a problem for the Sewage Department at City Hall. That was originally a culvert. That is, it had a road over it. You'll need the okay of the Roads Department. City Planning doesn't have a policy for such cases. Go to Zoning. The Fire Department objected to filling that cesspool. They need it because water pressure is bad there. Are you kidding? What we need is water, not sewage that breeds mosquitoes and causes rashes. Imagine cleaning that sewage out of our hoses! If there were a kiddie pool there, that'd be great for us too. What about your local school district? They should have a Child Welfare section. But this problem doesn't only affect children. Rebuilding all the schools has exhausted our resources. A problem this big should be handled by your city councilman. Sure, I'll write an introduction to the deputy mayor. Take my business card. He'll see you right away. Please have a seat. Thank you for all your efforts. There's really nothing we welcome more than folks like you who bring grievances like this directly to our attention. It's precisely for people like you that we established our new Public Affairs section. Don't hesitate to tell them all about it! Show these nice folks to the Public Affairs desk. You'll need to talk to Public Works. Desk 8. How dare you! Stop giving us the runaround! Why did you even put up that sign? So we'd waste our time? We're not idlers like all of you! We just want something done about that stinking cesspool! We don't care if it's Public Works, Sanitation, Public Health, or whoever! That's for Public Affairs to sort out! Fine! We're done with you jerks! All you do is laugh at us! You call this democracy? Let's go. Please wait a moment. I'm afraid our section chief is out today. It would be best if you could put it in writing. PUBLIC AFFAIRS SECTION CHIEF What do you think? The section chief never takes time off. Yeah. And he's been listless recently. But what'll we do if he's out for a long time? Exactly. He wouldn't take a day off just for a cold. And nothing moves here without his seal. That's right. I must say, it's a terrible shame. One more month and he'd have set a record of 30 years without a single absence. Some people are glad he isn't here. Bureaucrats always wonder who'll take the boss's place if he steps out. He's been taking a lot of medicine. What for? His stomach. He used to slurp his noodles to the bottom, but lately he barely touches them. Plain udon noodles in soup. Yet another record. I've never seen him eat anything else. Assuming the worst, who'll replace him? What's your rush? A lot of guys have to die before it's your turn! X-RAY ROOM - Mr. Hiraoka! - Yes. Your stomach? My stomach's bad too. They say it's chronic. These days I hardly feel alive unless my stomach hurts. Mr. Ko Suzuki. That man who just went in - His doctor told him he has an ulcer, but I'm sure it's stomach cancer. Has to be. And stomach cancer is practically a death sentence. The doc usually says it's just a mild ulcer and that there's no need to operate. That you can eat whatever you want as long as it's easy to digest. If that's what he tells you, you've got a year at most. But with some symptoms, you won't even last a year: first... a dull, heavy pain. Frequent unpleasant burping. A dry tongue. You can't seem to get enough water and tea. And then there's the diarrhea. And if it isn't diarrhea, it's constipation. Your bowel movements turn black. And then... the meat you used to love seems totally inedible. Whatever you eat you throw up half an hour later. And then you start throwing up food you ate a week before. At that point, you've got three months at most... Mr. Kanji Watanabe. Mr. Kanji Watanabe. Yes. Have a seat. Now, then... it looks like you have a mild ulcer. Please... tell me... the honest truth. Tell me it's stomach cancer. - No. As I just said, it's a mild ulcer. What about surgery? Can't you operate? No need for surgery. It can be treated medically. What about my diet? Well, let's see. Use common sense. If it's easy to digest, you can eat whatever you like. Has he got a year? No, no more than six months. - Six months? - Yeah. What would you do if you only had six months left to live? Miss Aihara, what about you? See the Veronal in the cabinet? Is there a blackout? The street lights are on, and the neighbors' lights. Strange. I wonder if Father is out. Where's the key? - In your handbag. Did Mrs. Hayashi leave it unlocked? She's so irresponsible. That's the problem with a part-time maid. Having her live in wouldn't cost much, but a burglary sure would. That's Dad's mentality. Typical petty bureaucrat. It's freezing. Just as bad inside as out. That's why I hate Japanese houses. It's such a drag coming home to this. I'd like a modern house. Honey... a house of our own would cost around 500,000 yen, right? Could we use your dad's retirement bonus as collateral? It must be worth 700,000 by now, plus a monthly pension of 13,000 yen... and another 100,000 in savings. But you think he'd agree? If he doesn't, we'll say we're moving out. That'll clinch it. Even Dad doesn't want to take that much money to the grave. Dad, what's the matter? Nothing. Nothing at all. Somethings not right. Listen... this is awful. - What is? He heard everything. He's awful. It may be his house, but this is our room. I can't believe he snuck in here while we were out. If he needed to talk to us, he should have said so. He's too old to be sulking around. Stop making that face. Enough about your dad. He has his life. We have ours. Hold me. How sad. She was so young. And to leave such a sweet little boy behind. She must have died filled with regret. Would you stop? You're like a broken record. Hurry! Mommy's getting away! Whenever remarriage comes up, you always use the boy as an excuse. When Mitsuo grows up, he won't care about you as much as you think. And when he gets married, they'll push you aside. You have to think about your own future. I'm telling you: Find a good wife now. Even my old lady says so. She imagines how filthy it must be with an oily-skinned man like you living as a widower. Dad. Mitsuo. Good night. Please lock the front door. Mitsuo! How about that? Great hit, huh? That batter is my - Mitsuo... Stupid idiot! What was he thinking? Mitsuo. Mitsuo, be brave. It's just your appendix. It's no worse than pulling a tooth. Can't you stay for the operation, Dad? I've got... some other things to do. Banzai! Banzai! Banzai! Banzai! Dad! Mitsuo... CERTIFICATE OF COMMENDATION FOR 25 YEARS OF DISTINGUISHED CIVIL SERVICE Mr. Watanabe left for work at his usual time. What? But nobody has seen him. It's been five days now. And he hasn't called in sick. The subsection chief asked me to check in on him. Ma'am. What? Impossible! Bu! ifs true. The man from his office said so. What could he be up to? It seems unbelievable, but it's true. The people at his house looked baffled. That puts me in a fix. Why? I can stamp any paperwork while he's out. But he has to approve any resignations, right? Why? Are you looking to quit? I don't belong here. Uncle, he even withdrew 50,000 yen. That miser? I wonder if he's got a woman. That would really be something. - Now, dear. - I'm sure it's not that. There's no telling when it comes to love. The ones you least expect are the most susceptible. If you ask me, he's actually a real lecher. A lecher with a solemn veneer. But he's stayed widowed these 20 years for you. It makes sense that he'd eventually snap, right? Nonsense. He's lost a lot of weight recently, and his oily skin has gotten rough and dry. There must be another explanation. You saw him recently? Four days ago. He showed up in the morning. I thought there was definitely something wrong. But your uncle here blurted out, “Why so glum? If you've come for a loan, forget it.” How could I suspect a love affair when he looked like that? Hush! You see... my husband thinks all men are as debauched as he is. Mitsuo, did anything happen at home? Nothing in particular. HEY -. Deliver this to my place. A guy from the magazine is waiting there. And get some cyclobarbital at the pharmacy. Just give them my name. But sir, the pharmacy's already closed. Is it that late? In this neighborhood folks go to bed after dinner. That stinks. I can't sleep unless I chase it down with whisky. Pardon me for butting in... but I happen to have some. Much obliged. May I pay you the official price? No, no. I was planning to throw it away. - But - - No, really. Really? Then let me pick up your tab. Oh, no. You can hold your liquor, right? Drink up. You hardly seem tipsy. Thank you. Even if I drink, I'll just throw it up. You see... I have stomach cancer. - Stomach cancer? - Yes. I don't know what to say. In that case, what you're doing is crazy. Yes, I'm ashamed to admit. I mean... drinking when you have stomach cancer is suicide. The thing is... I can't go through with it. “Go ahead and kill yourself,” I think. And yet... I just can't do it. I mean... I can't bring myself to make it final. But what have I been... living for all these years? You don't have children? Does your stomach hurt? No, it's not my stomach. There seems to be a deeper issue here. No. It's just... that I've been such a fool. I'm just... so mad at myself. Until just a few days ago... I had never even bought myself a drink. It's only now that I don't know how much longer I have to live... that I've finally begun - I understand. I understand. But drinking now is plain crazy. Besides, does it even taste good? No, it doesn't. But for a little while I can forget my cancer and all the other painful things. This... this expensive sake... is like drinking poison... to get back at myself. I mean... that is... it's kind of... a painful feeling... I understand. Sorry to be telling you all this. Listen... I have 50,000 yen on me that I'd like to spend all at once. But I'm ashamed to admit that I'm not even sure how to go about it. What I'm trying to say is - You want me to show you how to spend it? Yes. I realize it's terribly forward of me. But... This money - It took me decades to save up this money. All the more reason now to - I understand. But please put your money away. Tonight's on me. But that's not - Just leave things to me. It's fascinating. I realize it's rude to call you fascinating, but you're an extremely rare individual. I'm just a slacker who writes second-rate fiction. You've really started me thinking. They say there's something noble about suffering, and it's true. Misfortune teaches us the truth. Your cancer has opened your eyes to your own life. People are fickle and shallow. We only realize how beautiful life is when we face death. And even then, few of us realize it. The worst among us know nothing of life until they die. You're amazing! Rebelling against your past self at this age! That rebellious spirit moves me. You were a slave to your own life. Now you'll become its master. It's our human duty to enjoy life. Wasting it is desecrating God's great gift. We have to be greedy for life. They say greed is a vice, but that's outdated. Greed is a virtue, especially greed for enjoying life. Come on. Let's go reclaim the life you've wasted. Tonight it will be my pleasure to act as your Mephistopheles, but a beneficent one who won't ask for your soul. How perfect! There's even a black dog. Lead the way! Listen. These silver balls are you. They're your life itself. People strangle themselves in their daily lives. This machine sets them free. It's a vending machine for dreams and aspirations. No, don't! You wouldn't know it, but these women are the greediest of all mammals. It'll cost you a dozen hats to get that old one back. Besides, you're a new man now. Time to buy a new hat! Welcome. Welcome. It's been a long time! The same for your friend? What are you laughing at? It's the honest truth. He really does have cancer. - Then why's he drinking? - Idiot! That's why you'll never understand. Ecce homo. “Behold the man.” This man bears a cross called cancer. He's Christ. If you were diagnosed with cancer, you'd start dying right away. But not this fellow. That's when he started living. Isn't that right? Hey, don't stare like that. It's rude. This way. Anyone want to request a favorite? “Life is Brief.” What? “Life is Brief.” Fall in love, maidens That love song from the nineteen teens? Okay! Life is brief Fall in love, maidens Before the crimson bloom Fades from your lips Before the tides of passion Cool within you For those of you Who know no tomorrow Life is brief Fall in love, maidens Before the raven tresses Begin to fade Before the flames in your hearts Flicker and die For those to whom Today will never return That's it! That's the spirit! Life is brief Striptease. It isn't... an art. It's more than art. It's more direct. That female body gently undulating up there is a juicy steak, a glass of liquor, an injection of camphor, testosterone, streptomycin, uranium - Stop, please. Hey, stop the car. Wha... do we have a flat? I think he's throwing up. Let's sing something. I hate feeling blue. Section Chief! I thought it was you! I hardly recognized you in that new hat. I'm glad I ran into you. I was looking for your place. Are you off to work? No, I'm - Do you have your seal? No, it's back at home. I want to quit City Hall. I'm in a rush. I've found a new job. Then... come to my house. - Why are you quitting? - I'm bored. It's killing me. Every day is like the one before. Nothing new ever happens. I've put up with it for a year and half, but the only novel thing that's happened was that you took five days off... and now this new hat of yours. That's it. Listen, don't say anything when Dad gets back. I have nothing to say. I'm saying don't take that carping attitude. If you hadn't brought up his retirement bonus - How self-serving, blaming it all on me! You're the one who brought up his savings and how even he wouldn't take it all to the grave. But I still can't figure out why that was enough to make him act like this. He's never once stayed out all night. Let's drop it. We have no idea what he's doing, much less whether it's our fault. I'll wait here. Please come in for a bit. Honey! Thirty years. It kills me to think of 30 years in that place. I'm sorry. No, it's just that... recently... every time I see that award, it reminds me of that joke you read to us. I mean, it really rang true. All these 30 years... what have I been doing there? I can't remember no matter how I try. All I remember... is just being busy... and even then I was bored. I had you all wrong, sir. You really do understand! What a surprise! That's crazy. Whatever Uncle says, I know Dad best. But - It's unimaginable, Dad with such a young girl. It's not in the right format. Are you going to the office? Yes, I have to submit this. Could you turn in my sick-leave form? Why are you taking so much time off? Everyone's talking about it. They're calling it your “mutation.” I just... Are you really sick? You do look kind of pale. I just meant - I didn't think so. So where do you go when you pretend you're going to work? Don't try to hide it. But don't you know that Mr. Sakai came here yesterday and told them everything? Who cares, right? After 30 years without an absence, you deserve at least six months off. Besides, I'll cover for you. I'm not like Carp Windsock. - Carp Windsock? Yes, Mr. Sakai is a human carp windsock. His lips are always flapping, but he's just hot air inside. Plus he always acts like such a big shot. He makes 200 yen more a month than I do, so he looks down on me. Bye, then. Listen, I'll go with you. Ma'am? Ma'am! You're so lucky. I wish I could live in a house like yours. At our place, three families share two rooms. It's like the Warring States period. And you have a wonderful son, right? Tell me, where do they sell women's stockings? You want to buy some? Western clothing stores carry them. For your daughter-in-law, right? I've heard she's very pretty. That's according to Carp Windsock's report. - Are you all right? - I'm just so excited! - They make you that - - I'm so happy! To buy them myself, I'd have to have sardines for lunch for three months. But why did you buy them for me? Well, yours had holes in them. Do the holes in my stockings make your feet cold? Don't get me wrong - I was just kidding. I know you did it out of kindness, but I feel awkward at times like this. That's why I made a bad joke. Forgive me. Want to hear something good? Something good? I got so bored that I gave everyone at work nicknames. Wanna hear them? Sea Slug. - Sea Slug? Can you guess? Someone who's slippery and evasive. Mr. Ono, the subsection chief. Sea Slug... Gutter Cover. Someone who's damp and gloomy all year round. - Would that be Obara? - Bingo! Next: Flypaper. - Flypaper? - You know - sticks to everything. You guessed, right? Mr. Noguchi! Next is the floor supervisor, Mr. Saito. Can you guess his nickname? Mr. Saito. Let's see... His distinguishing feature is that he has none. I don't really know... Set Menu. - Set Menu? - At the cafeteria. And what about Kimura? Jelly Noodles. Timid and quivering. I had a nickname for you too. But I'm not going to tell, 'cause I had you all wrong. No, I don't mind. Tell me. Now I've put my foot in it. No, it would be worse if you didn't tell me. Okay, then: The Mummy. Forgive me. It's all right. So you mean I'm - I'll say good-bye here. Thank you so much. Do you really have to submit your resignation today? If you could make it tomorrow, we could spend today... You're not eating anything. It's just... You look so tired. No, today was really a lot of fun. But you snored through the best part of the movie. It's just that... I overdid it a bit last night. Mr. Kimura... This is something... I can't tell anyone. It's too embarrassing. You see, the reason... We worked... like a mummy these last 30 years - Oh, no! It's not that I mind you calling me a mummy... because that's exactly right. I don't blame you at all. It's just that the reason I turned myself into a mummy - What I mean is that I did it all... for my son's sake. But as it turns out, my son... couldn't care in the least. But you can't blame it all on your son. Isn't that right? Not unless he asked you to become a mummy. Parents are all the same. My morn gives me the same line sometimes. “All the trouble you've put me through!” I'm grateful she had me, but babies don't ask to be born. But what happened to make you bad-mouth your son to me? It's just... I knew it! You still adore him! No end in sight for the electricity shortage. Is that right? This heat is due to the warmest ocean currents in 30 years. Is that a fact? Actually, there's something... I'd like to tell you. I know I should have told you sooner, but it's not very pleasant business. Father, I already know. You see, I discussed it with Uncle today. We must address practical matters to avoid complications later. For instance, although we have rights as your heirs, you need to make those clear to avoid disputes. She's taken you for 50,000 yen in just a few days. Young girls these days - - What are you...? Father! We respect your free will, all right? We even accept your debauchery! But it's common sense to set some conditions. Think of Kazue, or at least of her family back home. How dare you bring home a woman like that! And holding hands with her in your room! I could hardly face Mrs. Hayashi when she told me! Two weeks have passed since our protagonist abandoned his post. During that time, various rumors and endless speculation about Mr. Watanabe have made the rounds. The rumors and speculation all agree on one thing: Whatever Mr. Watanabe is doing, it is very frivolous indeed. But in point of fact, Watanabe had never been this earnest about anything in his entire life. This isn't City Hall, where you can waste a whole day on an hour's work! I just - Every second I waste here costs me money. Then what about tonight? I'm pooped at night. I'd rather sleep than go out. Besides, why are you always taking me out? It's just - Let's stop doing this. It doesn't feel right. Just one last time tonight. No, or it'll never end! Now, excuse me. Tonight's the last time, okay? Shall we go for a stroll? I've had enough. Next it'll be a sweets shop, then a sushi or noodle joint. What's the point of these endless rounds? I feel bad saying this when you pay for everything, but I've had enough. We've run out of things to talk about. There's that face again. The truth is you give me the creeps. What's going on? Why do you chase me around like this? - It's just - - It's just what? It's just - I enjoy spending time with you this way. A May-December romance? Forget it. No, no! It's just that I - Just spit it out instead of sputtering like that. - Are you mad? - No. I don't even know myself... why I keep following you around. All I know is - Listen: I'm going to die soon. I've got stomach cancer. It's right here. Do you see? No matter how I struggle, I've only got six months to a year left. When I found out, I suddenly... in here - Now I remember: I nearly drowned in a pond once when I was a child. I felt exactly the same way then. Everything's going black. I writhe and thrash around, but there's nothing to hold on to... except you. - What about your son? Don't talk to me about him! I have no son. I'm all alone. - But - No, you don't understand. My son is somewhere far away. Just as my morn and pop were when I was drowning in that pond. Remembering it now, it's even more painful than it was then. But why someone like me? It's just that... when I look at you, I get a warm feeling... right here. Even an old mummy like me. What I mean is, you've been really kind to me. No, that's not it. You're young and healthy, and that's why - No. I mean... what makes you so lively? You're just so full of life. That's why I - That's why this mummy envies you! Before I die, even if only for one day, I want to be like that. Until I've done that, I can't let myself die. You see, I just... I just want something to - I want to do something. I just don't know what. But you know. No, maybe you don't, but - But I don't! Tell me, how can I be like you? - But all I do is work and eat! - What else? That's all! It's true. All I do is make these little things. Just making these is so much fun. I feel like I'm making friends with every baby in Japan. Why don't you try making something too? What could I possibly make at that office? Yeah, it's hopeless there. You should quit and go somewhere... It's too late. No... it's not too late. It's not hopeless. Even there, there's something I can do. I just have to find the will. There's something I can do. It's only a matter of time before he resigns. His son came by yesterday about his retirement bonus. Which means you'll finally be section chief. Well, you never know. Good morning. Section Chief. Ono, take care of this. PETITION TO REPAIR AND FILL IN CULVERT KUROE WOMEN'S ASSOCIATION TO BE ASSIGNED TO PUBLIC WORKS Is this really a job for Public Works? Actually, this is precisely the kind of job that Public Affairs should oversee. Public Works can't do it alone. Parks and Sewage must also take action. Get me a car, will you? I'm going out to survey the site. Put together a report today. Sir, I'm not sure that's possible. It is if you set your mind to it. Five months later. The protagonist of our story has died. Let us see the deputy mayor. He must be here. Just five minutes, please. Reporters. What should I tell them? - Your suspicions are groundless. - Are they? Our claim is based on thorough research. Sir, the official story is that the Parks Department and local councilman built that park with your backing, but wasn't it really Mr. Watanabe? That's the word. Mr. Watanabe was chief of Public Affairs. Building parks is the Park Department's job. We understand that. But the plan almost fizzled out several times. We're talking about the man who saw it to completion. Local residents believe that that was Mr. Watanabe. They're deeply concerned about the fact that he died in the park he built. What's that supposed to mean? Well, they were suspicious even before that happened. For example, in your speech at the park's opening ceremony, you never mentioned Mr. Watanabe once. They say it wasn't a congratulatory address. Then what was it? A campaign speech. Furthermore... he was completely ignored during the ceremony and seated in the back corner. In short, people feel a lot of sympathy for the guy. So the fact that he died in the park has led to some interesting speculation. It's seen as an act of silent protest against top city officials. So you're saying Watanabe committed suicide or at least let himself freeze to death? More or less. I see. Don't forget it was also snowing last night. Sounds like a scene right out of a play. However... an autopsy has clearly established the cause of Watanabe's death. He certainly didn't commit suicide. Nor did he freeze to death. He died of stomach cancer. - Stomach cancer? That's right. Internal hemorrhaging. Watanabe died suddenly, without warning. If you have any doubts - Ono, give them the name of the hospital. It's just not right. The way these reporters think, and their tactlessness - Actually... it applies to the general public too. They just don't understand how government works. They're woefully ignorant of how we function. Take that little park in Kuroe. Some seem to believe that Watanabe built it, but that's ridiculous. Maybe I shouldn't say this here at his wake, in front of his son and relatives... but I'll go ahead, because I think Watanabe would agree with me. Certainly, Watanabe went to great pains to get that park built. I take my hat off to his enthusiasm. But his efforts were part of his official duties. The idea he went beyond the scope of his office to facilitate citizens' desires and actually built the park himself is nonsense to those who understand our bureaucracy. Watanabe himself would grimace at the idea. However... we may be partly to blame for the fact people are saying such things. All eyes were on that epoch-making project as it was rushed to completion. Maybe we should have singled out someone's service. For instance... the chief of the Parks Department. Or his superior... the chief of Public Works. If you say so, Mr. Deputy Mayor, but here's what I think. The head of the Parks Department and I only fulfilled the duties of our offices. But when I think how difficult it was to navigate the intricate politics of the city council and realize the park's construction, it is you, Deputy Mayor, who should be singled out. Now, now... Some people have even criticized my speech at the opening ceremony. Isn't that right, Ono? They called it a campaign speech! Excuse me. The residents of Kuroe are here asking to burn incense for the deceased. Kiichi, come. You too, Mitsuo. It sure is cold. May I pour one for you? I'll get some warm sake. What do you say? Why don't you all move closer down here? Why not? - Over here, please. - Thanks. Mr. Hayashi. Mr. Ono. Did all the big shots go off to a meeting? Yes. No, they just couldn't stand to stay here. I don't care what anyone says. It was Mr. Watanabe who built that park. The deputy mayor and his people know it. That's going too far. As the deputy mayor said - That's right. I'm not saying this because I'm in the Parks Department, but we drew up the plans and oversaw construction. - That's not what I meant. - Now, now... I understand how you feel, but - The point is he was in Public Affairs. Did he think he could just build a park? We have to respect each other's turf or - If I had to say how that park got built, I'd say it was coincidence. Hear me out. If a looming election hadn't put pressure on the local councilman, and if profiteers hadn't lobbied to build a red-light district there, that reclamation work wouldn't have proceeded so quickly. That's right. Exactly right. There's one thing I can't figure out. Why would someone like him suddenly change like that? What could it have been? I agree. It's a complete mystery. It really is. I mean... with the benefit of hindsight, it would seem he knew he had stomach cancer, and that's why - We were just discussing whether your father knew he had stomach cancer. Well, I think he would have told me if he did. Indeed. I believe my father was fortunate to die without realizing he had cancer. A diagnosis like that is a death sentence. I see. Well, that rules out Saito's theory. What theory is that? Well, five months ago he went through a sudden transformation. That's for sure. And none of us has any clue what caused it. Well, that was a woman's doing. With a young mistress, the hormonal effect can temporarily rejuvenate an old man. Happens all the time. It suddenly put a sheen back on his cheeks. Actually... we heard rumors at that time of a romance. That explains the rakish hat. Sure does. That surprised the hell out of me. Sir, I'm not sure that's possible. It is if you set your mind to it. But wait. In any case, his enthusiasm was a bit over the top. Yes. That's very true. I don't mean to argue, but a woman alone can't account for - - But - - Dear. The thing is... it just doesn't make sense. Not to change the subject, but there were times when his extraordinary zeal threatened to derail it all. That's city hall for you. Gotta guard your turf. That's right. The biggest mystery to me is how a 30-year veteran could suddenly forget the rules. It's because he - In any event... pushing his plan on all the other departments ensured that everyone would dig in their heels. My boss was none too happy about it. Building parks is the Parks Department's job. We have our own proposals for new parks. Couldn't you reconsider? This site is really terrible. But building a park isn't as simple as you outline in your proposal. No, this proposal is just - I understand. Tell you what: I'll study your proposal thoroughly. But you know, in the end even the parks chief caved in to Watanabe's tenacity - You've got a point there. He really didn't know what to do. He really was something. He would wait days for the answer he wanted. Our section chief would sneak away the second he saw Watanabe's face. That's right. Section Chief! He even pleaded with underlings like me. It was unbelievable! Won't you please...? Isn't there some way...? Finally we couldn't stand by any longer. That's right. We took pity on him too. But you guys in General Affairs were the worst of all. Wait a minute! I went around with him, so I know. You made us beg for two weeks. I won't forget that. Sorry about that. However... remember the most surprising thing? - Oh, right. - That was a shocker. DEPUTY MAYOR'S OFFICE But you know what was even more surprising? The incident in the deputy mayor's office? - I heard about that! - That was something! A section chief openly defying the deputy mayor - unprecedented at City Hall! Listen, about that new park... it's one thing to show initiative, but you don't want people thinking you're a publicity hound. And the city council's got problems of its own. I think it's best just to let the proposal die. Last night there was a banquet at Nakagawa. I tell you, geisha these days are appalling. One of them spent the evening sulking and didn't say a word. The proprietress said she was a student working part-time! That's a good one! Couldn't you please... reconsider the proposal? What did you just say? I mean... about that park... won't you reconsider your decision? But the thing is, when you look at the results, was it worth taking it that far? No, it was crazy! Everyone at City Hall is guarding his own turf. But didn't the deputy mayor end up reconsidering? That's because the councilman needled him. It was just coincidence. You're attributing everything to Watanabe's “zeal.” Don't be so sentimental! Sentimental! Is that so? I don't see it that way. If all of you can't understand his dedication, the world's a dark place indeed. It is a dark place. From just looking at Mr. Watanabe you could tell that only his work was keeping him alive. Didn't it look that way to you? Sometimes it even gave me chills. When was it? I was... That reminds me of when I'd see him at the construction site. That look in his eyes! As if he were watching his child or grandchild, the apple of his eye. Of course. He nurtured that park like you would a child. So what are you saying? Like I said before: Whatever anyone says, Mr. Watanabe built that park - But if the councilman and deputy mayor hadn't been facing reelection, the plan wouldn't have become a reality. Watanabe had no role in what was going on higher up. That's not actually true. Really? The folks who wanted that red-light district definitely thought Watanabe was blocking their way. Listen to this: Section Chief. Are you Section Chief of Public Affairs? Yes. Just the man I wanted to see. Old man, you'd better mind your own business. Just what are you trying to - Don't play dumb! No hard feelings. Just shut up and back off. Say something! You value your life? This is Watanabe. I just don't get it. Why would someone like him - I just don't... get it. No, I'm sure Mr. Watanabe knew he had stomach cancer. But - I just suddenly remembered something. This is too much! We've been at this for two weeks. We've explained it to them 20 times. They could at least tell us if there are funds. General Affairs is just being sadistic. It's not like it's their personal money. Why can't they be more agreeable? Well, you know - Doesn't it make you furious to be treated with such contempt? No. I can't afford to hate people. I haven't got that kind of time. You mean - Wait! Now that you mention it... that reminds me... of something. How beautiful! Truly beautiful. A sunset. I don't think I've really looked at one in 30 years. But I haven't got time for this now. He knew! He knew he didn't have long left to live - It makes everything clear as day. There's no other explanation. That explains his extraordinary passion and his strange behavior. Now what he did makes perfect sense! Absolutely. We'd have done the same. But any of us could die at any moment. Listen... Subsection Chief. I mean you... the new Section Chief of Public Affairs. Section Chief! Are you listening? I haven't been promoted yet. See here! Ono! - Cut it out. What did you say a minute ago? “We'd have done the same.” Don't make me laugh. Hey, that's enough now. You think you could have done what Mr. Watanabe did? Don't make me laugh. Listen, Ohara... the thing is - I may look dumb, but - Don't you think... Okay, I only went to night school... so I'll never make section chief! - Watanabe was a great man! No, great's not the right word. - But you, Ono? - What's the right word? - Don't make me laugh. - Compared to him - Compared to Mr. Watanabe, the rest of us - We're worthless scum! Including you! That's going too far. We may be scum... but some of us start out at City Hall as good people. But the longer you stay - I didn't used to be - You're not supposed to do anything at City Hall. Doing anything is considered radical! We have to act like we're doing something while doing nothing. - That's right. - In our department too! The thing is, just to get a garbage can somewhere emptied out, you need enough paperwork to fill another garbage can. That's exactly right! Seal after seal after seal! That's just an excuse. We waste people's valuable time. The public is upset by bribes and 40,000 cars and so on, but those are just farts next to this invisible, colossal waste of time! Listen here. I often have the same concerns. But in that labyrinthine machine, you can't do a thing! All that meaningless busywork and not a moment to think! Idiots! But the thing is, Mr. Ohara, even within a system where you can't get a thing done, and battling stomach cancer at that, Mr. Watanabe managed to accomplish so much. That's it! That's what I wanted to say! That's why I get so angry! That's what I'm saying! Mr. Watanabe expected no reward! That's right! When you imagine how he must have felt, his life on the line - Anyone who tries to take the credit isn't human! The deputy mayor. Just say it! That's going too far... Listen. How do you think he felt... dying all alone in that park? Just thinking about it... A policeman brought this by. He found it in the park. And he'd like to light incense for the deceased. Thank you for taking the trouble. Come in. Won't you stay a bit and have a drink? We appreciate your coming out of your way. Please sit down. To tell you the truth... last night I was... on patrol... in the new park... when I came across him. It was 10:00 - no. Nearly 11:00. He was on the swing... even though it was snowing. I just assumed he was some drunk. I was derelict in my duty. If I'd followed my first inclination and taken him in, this wouldn't have happened. What I did was unforgivable. But he seemed to be... so perfectly happy. I can't explain it. He poured his whole heart into that song of his... with a haunting voice... that filled... the depths of my soul. Life is brief Fall in love, maidens Before the crimson bloom Fades from your lips Before the tides of passion Cool within you For those of you Who know no tomorrow Listen, last night... under the stairs, I found a pouch with my name on it. Inside were Dad's bankbook and seal, along with forms for claiming his retirement bonus. So he left it before he went to the park? It was so cruel of him... not to tell us he had cancer. If I'd known sooner - Hey, why didn't his girlfriend show up? I wonder if she really was his girlfriend after all. I'll do my best! I swear it! - We must carry on his work! We can't let his death be in vain! I'll be like a man reborn! We'll sacrifice ourselves in the service of the people! Never forget this feeling! I'm going to do my best! PUBLIC AFFAIRS SECTION CHIEF Sir... the sewage main break in Kisaki is overflowing into Takao. Public Works. Please go to Public Works. Desk 8. Kenbo! Yoko! Come in for dinner! THE END
