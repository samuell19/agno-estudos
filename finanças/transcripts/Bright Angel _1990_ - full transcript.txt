You all set? Shine, George. Shine now! Well, there's that. Yes, sir. Lot of 'em. Lot of 'em that time. Good work on the light, George. You were as steady as a rock. How many? Forty-three. Mallards, mostly greenheads. See any game wardens out there? Yeah, I saw 100 of 'em. They never saw me. How's the railroad, Jack? Mean and lean. Pay's regular. Thank you, Bill. So, what's the plan? I saved back three quackers. We can grill 'em. Do somethin' different. Surprise your mom. Good. That'll make her happy. You can't box on dead legs, you know. You gonna make your weight, huh? I think so. Yeah? Yeah. Actually, it'll be good if you came in a little over. That's the way you win. You can't do that. They don't let you do that anymore. Come outside, I'll show you something. I'm, uh, going outside with Claude for a minute. I'll be right back. Don't fuck around, okay? I'm not gonna be here all clay. I won't. Promise. The old fart was an asshole. Vvhatisit? Sherman's got a woman with him out at the motel, which is typical. He deadheaded her from Havre last night. Only now, he wants out of it. So, who does he call? Ha! His son. I'm gonna get him out of it. It ought to be funny. I guess you don't wanna see it though, huh? I'll see it. Ha! I'd like to take a look at that. Sherman forgets where he hides it. Rocket fuel. C'm0n, man. Fire up your missile. - Hey, mama, look. - Look who's here. Mama! Here comes the great lady's man. The big Indian. Clear conscience is no conscience. Hmm, you two are drunk as monkeys. No, we're not drunk at all. I gotta get home right now. Hazel thinks I'm still in Havre. Maybe you are. Maybe we're all in Havre. What's her name? Lucy. She's a nice girl. She's Canadian. Could be why she likes you. Maybe she'll like me. I'm bringing her out here. She gonna be my present from you? What are we doing? Oh, I'm taking her outta here... He's tellin her he's gonna meet her someplace later, but he ain't. I'm just gettin' rid of her. Maybe I'll kill her. That's what Indians are supposed to do, right? I mean, what else is available? All right, now. Here's some shut up money. So, shut up. So, okay now. This is Lucy. This is Claude, he's my son. And his close friend, George. I'll be back in an hour or two. Let her in, Claude. She don't wanna go with us. Yes, she does. I'm not gettin' in that back seat. There isn't any seat back there. Oh, shit. Let her in front. There's room. Go on. Watch out. Hello. Hello. Don't give me any fuckin' trouble or I'll break you up. I'm hungry- Spend some of that money on me. Be a big shot. I don't give a shit if you're hungry. John, I just went by your place and, uh, there's a car out there. You might wanna check in with your old lady... See what's going on. What, did you rob something? No. Yeah, you did. You robbed something. You got a new accomplice? We're just goin' for a ride down to Great Falls. You're not. You're coming home with me. We've got some ducks to clean. Come on. Okay. We'll miss you, George. You don't know what I'm saving you from, Son. Yes, he does. Who was that with Claude? You two in some trouble? Nothing Claude can't handle. Boy, oh, boy, Georgie... You know, your mother once said something to me I've never forgotten. She said, "Nobody dies of a broken heart." This was somewhat before you were born. We were living down in Casper still, then. Had some big blowup, that was the idea she had. I don't know why. I don't know why I even thought of it. Here, have a drink, Son. Somethin' ought to be good in life. What do you worry about, George? Do you worry about girls? Hmm? Do you worry about your future sex life? Is that some of it? I don't worry about that. No? Well, what then? What else is there? I worry if you're gonna die before I do, or if mother is. That worries me, I'd say. If I were you I'd worry we might not. Things pass too fast in your life, George. Don't worry about that. Let's go home the back way. Well, there's a car isn't it? Hello. Hello. What's your name? Woody. Woody? Where's Aileen, I mean, where's Mrs. Russel, Woody? Guess you're not robbin' my house, now, are you? No. Upstairs. I think she went upstairs. Good. That's a good place. Georgie, step outside with Woody and wait on me, all right? Just stay there, and I'll come out. Let's just go outside. Hmm? Let's go outside. All right. I like it out here. Nothin' to bother ya. The Great Plains commence here. You play football? No. I have been drinking. But I'm not drunk now. Well, that's a real joke. Find your goddamn suitcase, just find it. Did you know your mother was married before? Yeah, I knew that. Happens to all of them now. They can't wait to get divorced. I guess so. What do you do for a living? I'm in the Air Force. This your day off, then? No. What's the matter with you? Don't you understand somethin'? Hmm? I don't know what to do about you. I don't have any idea. You're crazy, aren't you? Are you goddamn crazy, man? Are ya? Huh? Are you in love with her? Are ya? He's not in love with me. For Christ's sake! Come on, say you love her so I can blow your fuckin' brains in the sky. All right. No. Jack, let's stop now. Let's just stop. You're leaving! That's why you're packed. Now, go on, get out! You're not making me leave. I'm just leaving. George has to be at work in the morning. I'd like to find some way to hurt you. I feel helpless about it. Where are you from? Chicago. A suburb of there. Your parents alive? I bet they both wish you were dead, though. Somebody else is gonna have to kill you, 'cause I don't want to have to think about you. Guess that's it. This all seem stupid to you? All this yellin' and goin' nuts? I don't blame you. I don't know what to do now. It'll be all right. So, what do you think? I think you could've been more limited, maybe. Maybe you shouldn't have had her leave, maybe. That's one version, okay. That was a mistake. She should still be here. That's another usual fuckup. You could go try and find her. W-We could do that. Where would you look? I don't know. In the cafe, maybe? That is probably exactly where she is, or will be soon. Think I'll eat first, if that's okay. I made you supper, you wanna eat? I'll eat. Wait a minute, y-you... Wash your hands. You got dirt on your hands. I'm your father. I ought to be able to do somethin' for ya, shouldn't I? Come on. Sure. Harsh words are all alike, George. But you can make 'em up, they all mean the same thing. What's that? They mean, uh, "What about me?" You know, that's all. You understand? That's all it is, just me. New arrivals of the latest Western fashions... George? What... What kind of trouble are you in? Just on the loose. Loosey-goosey. Right. You know what you find when you're on the loose, don't you, George? Uh-uh. You don't know that? I wouldn't want to spoil it for you. A drink of Pepsi, please. How's your mom, George? She's fine. She rolled by here tonight. She didn't say where she was going, now, did she? Nope, nope, nope. Did not. I got to piss so bad I could cry. My! You forget somethin'? Yeah, I forgot to stay out of town. Where'd you and Claude go? Oh, we had a wonderful time. You wouldn't believe the places we went or the things... Great Falls, Montana. That's a nice place. I'm glad I got to see that. I'll have a coffee, please. Did you see a Pontiac hardtop driving through town? Can't say I've been payin' much attention to passin' cars lately. Where are you guys going? I'm ridin' the bus in the morning, I guess. Looks like what's-his-name's old man had an engagement he forgot about. Is this place open all night, I hope? It closes when the midnight yard crew gets off. Lucky me. Why don't you take me home with you? I don't think you'd be very comfortable. You wouldn't be, you mean. It will... It will... It'll work out real good, realgood. Where're you goin' on the bus? Casper, Wyoming. Where I already should've been two days ago if I was worth anything, which apparently I'm not. What's down there? My brother's in jail down there. That sounds nice. Doesn't it, though? We're all very happy for him. I got an aunt in Casper. My mother's sister. That's just great. Maybe I'll see her when I'm there. You got any messages for her? You want me to drive you down there? Uh-huh. I'm serious. How far is it? Couldn't be that far. I don't have to work tomorrow. You pay for gas. Oh, I've got money. This young lady's ricling the old blue doggy tonight. She got a date with fate in the great state of Wyoming. I'm driving her down there. How long was I gone? 'Bout as long as your attention span. I don't have anything to wait on. I'm going, too. You guys wait in my mom's car, I gotta go over here and leave a note for somebody. Who's it for, your wife? You're writing your memoirs in here? "Dear Dad..." Aw, that's nice. "I'm fine, but I'm just gonna take a drive..." To Wyoming. "Don't worry about me, I'm fine." You said that once. "And I will be home pretty soon, and I will not drop any weight." You worried about losing weight? Give it to me. Let's see what his old lady's got back here. Here's a fishing rod. Uh-oh, here's a six-pack. Here's a pair of blue jeans. Why don't you leave that stuff alone, Claude? Hmm, here's some lipstick. I'm not gonna try to guess what else is back here. Where's your mom, now? Where she's supposed to be. That's... Must be where she is. What's that thing? It's a thing the dentist gives you to make you keep your mouth open. Are we gonna drive, or are we gonna sit here and hallucinate? We're goin' out of here. Whoo-hoo! What does your father do on the railroad? Brakeman. What does your old man do? Farmer. He's an American. He left to avoid the draft and got very lucky to marry my mother. They got everything through inheritance from her family. Not that they're rollin' in it, no. They're conservatives now, of course. What were you doin' with Sherman? The Chief? Yeah. He's a long story, best left. The Chief, he's not so bad. You certainly wouldn't think he'd sit in the dark in the middle of the night and pray in a motel, would you? But he does. I laid there and listened to him. Where is this, Chicago? Probably going the wrong way. I should be driving. I'd like to take a bath, and I can't do it in a washroom sink. You must be dirty. Mmm-hmm. Mmm-hmm. Oh, what's the fun out here? That must be a well-kept secret. You are. You're our reward for bein' able to put up with you. Good luck with that party. You'd do better alone, wouldn't you? Being with you is like being alone. You got to look real close if you want to see anything. Have a good look. I've got a brother, remember? Which Way's north? I like to stay oriented. You got a clothespin on your tongue? Do you think your parents ever lied to you? Why? Did they lie to you? Not that I know of. I hope mine lied to me. I wouldn't want to know all the shit they know, would you? Sure, I wanna know it. I think I'll have a warm beer. Whoo-hoo! I got one! I got one! Whoo-hoo! Check it out, boy! Check it out! Oh, here it comes! He's a fool, you know? He's not a fool, he's smart. You just wouldn't want to be him. He wouldn't wanna be you, either. Whoo! Check it out, check it out, man! Okay. I'm too hard on him, he's your buddy. That's right. That's right. Whoa! And I don't mind feeling lonely out here. But I don't know why I think I've got time to just lie here like this. That's your business, I guess. I got you now. Do you have a girlfriend? No. Don't fight me. Then tell me what you've done that's shameful. You already know something about me, even though I've clone worse. Oh, check it out, man. Easy, 685V- Nothing, uh, I haven't clone anything. Lying. That's shameful. You're not ashamed of anything, I guess. Yes, I am. I'm ashamed of leaving home without saying anything to anybody. Oh, and I'm ashamed of spending that night with Sherman, in that motel. That's just two days of things. My mother took ofi' recently, and I was glad about it. I'm ashamed of that. That's a shameful lie, right there. She's probably happy anyway. Come here! You gotta see it! Why don't you just kiss me? Just for a minute. I don't care. Let him see us. Just kiss me back, like that. I like that. - You're both drunk! - You're both fuck-drunk! Don't act jealously. Come look at this fish. It's a real big fish. Let's see his poor fish. Then maybe we can get out of here. Ain't it lively? It's a real big fish. It's probably good to eat. What a surprise that must be for the fish. Everything just goes crazy at once. I wonder what it thinks? Fish don't think. Ow! Son of a bitch thing! Fuckin' fish is dangerous. What is that, the Indian way of fishing? Okay. It's your fish, you do something with it. I don't want the fuckin' thing. Okay... Let me have that knife. You might kill me if I give it to you, huh? I'm gonna put this poor fish out of its misery. Okay, you do it. There you go. You want me to be ashamed of that, too? No. Well, I bet you'll do anything, huh? Why you'd fuck a pig in knickers, I'll bet, huh? You Canada girls? I do commit the wrong sins, sometimes. What do you think you're good for, huh? Everybody thinks they're good for something, or are you just good for nothing? You boys all seem alike to me. You don't have to act that way. Hey! I don't think that's necessary now. This is what I want. No. Claude, I'm gonna take you back to town. You can catch the bus. Let's stop this. Get in the car. It's all right, I got some money, I'll buy you a ticket. Fuck you. Okay? Just fuck you guys. You boys. I love you boys, you're so wonderful. Fuck 'em, fuck 'em. I'm all right. That's great! The great fisherman. I wonder what he's thinking about now. Who's this? Your whole family, featuring you as a kid? This is right after my clad got out of the Air Force. He wanted to be a jet mechanic. But he didn't do that, he went to work with BM, switchin'. What are your plans for a bright future? Well, I'd like to go to college. I'd like to join the boxing team. If there is such a thing as a boxing team. College is back that way, isn't it? Yeah. It is. Casper, the friendly Wyoming. What a place. My brother said it was nicer than this. Maybe it grows on you, if you're here longer than I plan to be. What would you do for amusement? Beat people up. Steal things. The usual. Oh, I understand that's a privilege and not a right. Yeah, I am Canadian, that's right. Fuck you! It is not an easy matter to have your brother in jail. You cannot talk to him. That's what they have in mind, right? Besides, you haven't been in that much of a hurry, till now. Oh, I know it. Where're you stayin'? Hmm? I got an aunt in town... Oh, yeah. Her place. Yup. You can afford this place? Oh, I've been saving my money. I'm where I'm going, anyway. You're lucky. Well, you can stay with me tonight, till you figure it out. How many times have you been in a motel room with other girls? Not many times. Offering consignments from top-quality... Not any times. This is a big deal for you then, isn't it? Too bad it can't be with somebody you're in love with. Not that that makes any difference to men, or boys, whichever you are. It doesn't make any difference to me. You probably are in love with me, aren't you? No. I'm not. Good, that's very smart. Hey? Hey? What you up to? Minding my own business, is that safe around here? Yeah, you lookin' for a job? Pay a lot of money, yes or no? No. - You a farm boy? - No. Well, you could've fooled me. Are you sure you don't want a job, 'cause I got a job. Yeah, I'm sure. All right. Hi, there. Hi, Judy, it's George. Aileen's son. Oh, Jesus Christ, it is not! Kind of thought I'd come by and... But you're just a little, bitty boy, you can't be this immense. And handsome. Oh... Well, come on in. Harley? Harley... I don't want you to get up out of that wheelchair or anything, but guess who is here... It's George! Remember George? My sister's only baby and look at him. Look, this is what he's turned out to be, right here. All right. Well, how you doin'? Good. Oh, you are up there, ain't you? You are way up tall. Up in the clouds. We're gettin' ready to have lunch. Why don't you just sit right down there and eat with us? Hey, come here, George. I got something I wanna show you. Harley, for goodness' sakes, let him just sit. Right. All right, now. Right in here. Starlight. This'll light you up after dark. No. I'm a civil engineer. Did you know that? Yeah, I knew that. We met once. We did? I don't remember. I met Judy right down there on Wyoming Street, in town. It was two clays after I got out of the U.S. Army. I came out here to get rich. Right. Hey. You know what I can do with this instrument? Sure. I can part some cowboy's hair for him in a different spot. Long distance, man. Why would you want to do that? Why not? They put me in this chair. How do you think I got in this chair? I'm standing down underneath the rig, somebody opens up his lunch bucket, drops an orange straight down on my head. It broke me all up to pieces. And one of these clays they're gonna come up here to finish the job. And that's when I'll be sitting here, waiting, with my answer. Do you really think they'll come up here, right to your house? I don't see anybody doin' that. Why, sure, they'll come up here. They'll have on white sheets. They'll come right through that front door, and... That's what I'll have to say to those motherfuckers! Ha! Yeah, that'll be great. That will be great. Yeah. Won't that be great? See, I got a... I got a sense of personal mission in this, son. I have suffered a loss. And somebody got to pay for that. I guess that's true. Yeah... That is true. It's true as that I'm sitting here. And I sure am sitting here. You're not through with school yet, are you? Yeah, I am. I finished in summer school. How old are you? Eighteen. - Are you? - Mmm-hmm. I don't think you're that old. Hmm, I must've blinked. Families don't do what they used to do. Draw you together. We used to have holidays, you know, before Harley's accident. When you were little. Things just draw you apart, I guess. You haven't heard from my mom, have you? I thought maybe she might've called you. I thought she might even come down here. Where was she going? Her and my clad had kind of a blowup. What kind of blowup? Well, I don't know about it, exactly. They just got mad, and she left. Who was it with? Nobody. She just left, that's all. Mmm. Nobody just leaves. Not in my experience. You leave by yourself, and that's where you're gonna be. And nobody wants to be in that place, I'll tell you that right now. Well, that's what she did, anyway. You may not know everything about everything. I know enough, and that's for goddamn sure. She wouldn't come here anyway. Why not? Why not? Because she likes me too much, that's why not. Harl... Ah, no, even in this cripple's chair, she couldn't resist me. There's ways around everything. Harl, now don't say that. That's not true. It's not true, George. Aileen never did anything like that. Hmm. It's his mother, for God's sake, don't lie about her. I'm not lying about her. Yeah, you are, you're lying about her. You're full of shit, in fact. She wouldn't have anything to do with you in a million years. And why not? Why don't you think she would, is there something wrong with me? No, nothing's wrong with you, you're married to her sister, that's all. Really? She wouldn't do something like that. Oh, they never do that, do they? I mean, that's what they never, ever do. I mean, they never like the wrong guy. Was she by herself? I'm her sister, I'd forgive her if she wasn't. No, she wasn't. Dad made her leave, though. He pushes things out, too far, sometimes. And you come here yourself, looking for her? Is that what you're doing here, hon? I guess so. I don't know. Do you always know what you're doing when you're doing it? Not always. That's right. We're not real close anymore. But, she might call up. You do strange things. Everybody does. I've run off before. Four times. But I came back. Did Harley come looking for you? Couldn't very well. He can't do much in his chair. He just had to wait till I showed up. I didn't mind that. Well, I guess you're a man now, Georgie. It's sad, isn't it? Ugh, there's so many new things to think about. It'll be all right. Or it won't. You'll survive. Now, how do you think you can get somebody out of jail? I got a plan to do it. Well, let's hear about it. Okay. Let's say this is true, the way to get out of trouble, is find someone with worse trouble, and get them to help you. That's not true about women. Oh? What's true about women in the words of the great expert? My father said, "Don't ever get hooked up with a woman "who's in worse trouble than you are.“ What are you doing away from home anyway, huh? I hope you don't mind. I went down on your friend, Clause, Clark, whatever. I just had too many troubles to help myself, you know? Yeah. Well, whatever floats your boat. Oh, well it floated mine. Floated his right to the top, I guarantee it. Hey, you wanna fight? No, I'm sure you don't. Hey, Butch. Be right back, George. Let me borrow your fountain pen a second. Thanks. What's your last name? George what? Mmm-hmm. Oh, George no-lead-in-his-pencil. Well, we'll make you an Indian again. You couldn't pour piss out of a boot, you poor thing. Is that right? Uh-huh. Why don't you go win $100 and get out of my life? Won't cost me that much. Mmm-hmm. Don't slap him, punch him! Come on, come on! Hey, kid, don't get up. Since when does watching me get to be so interesting? I wasn't watchin' you. I was lookin' at you and thinkin' about something else. People must do that to you a lot. I just got my ass kicked and I don't like it. I was just thinkin' about that. That's what my mother is. A kick ass. Isn't that funny? No. That's because you don't think it's funny. So, what? Your mom and your clad had a big bust up, huh? What'd she do? Man, she was in the house with some phony. My clad came home, so he threw her out. I guess she was screwin' him. What's your dad doin' about it? I don't know. Nothin' maybe. You gonna bring them back together again? Be a little Cupid? Right. Bullshit. Bull, period, shit, period. Well, no, then! Is that better? You're out is where you are. Simplified. Okay. I left town with you. Have you got a better idea? If you do, tell me 'cause I'm gonna get the hell out of here. I can leave you to your brother. I don't mind. No. Don't do that. You don't have to do that. I'd rather have you in here. It's nicer. - You can protect my interests. - What interests? I got a lot of money with me. How much? $6,000. American money. Where is it? It's under this mattress I'm layin' on right now. Want me to show it to you? Yeah. I trust ya. Where did you get it? My pop. He hordes shit, money, things like that, in his boxes. He can't use the banks because he's an American fugitive. So, I borrowed some. Some clay I'll give it back. Maybe. Boy, that Indian could fight. I could not whip him. I know you couldn't. You didn't whip him. Surely you would've if you could've. I couldn't whip him if... if we had a hundred fights and I got better every time. Sometimes you can't win, and you can't believe it. You can't see yourself losin'. I mean, you're a winner when you think about it. Then you got to get used to losin'. Tell me something I might not know. I wish I could. I'd like that. Take a seat right here in the booth. Just in the middle. AT&T, operator. I'd like to make a collect call, please. To my clad, Jack. Your name please? George. Thank you, George. There's no answer. Would you like to place your call later? No. Thanks. Just what did your brother do? He stole some trucks full of oil and got caught at it. And where am I taking you? 1790 Madera. That's where I have to see the guys, the guys I have to pay. What guys? These guys who stole all the oil with Johnny. They're still out and they're ready to testify against him to save their little asses. What's your father think about you taking all that money, huh? Oh, it saves him from having to do this anyway. He's not exactly equipped for adventure. I guess you love your brother. Yup. I love him. Probably marry him if he wasn't your brother, right? I never thought of that. Why would anyone think of that? Well, you're going to all this trouble. Ah, I'd be in trouble somewhere. I just do irrational things to stay awake. Okay. I can probably do this myself. No, you can't. I'll help you. Mmm. Did somebody order a pizza? Are these Girl Scouts or what now? I'm here about Johnny. Who's Johnny? I don't know him. He's my brother. Lucky him. Maybe you can help me find somebody named Bob? Bob? Bob. I'm Bob. Are you? How may I serve you? I have to get Johnny out of jail. I want to pay you to leave town. If you leave, nobody'd be here to testify against him. So, are you sellin' naked pictures of yourself, or him, or what? I've got money. Well, then. Come on inside. Company! Come on up to our, uh, family room. It's cozy up here. Okay. Okay, you want some coffee? Or decaf? Uh, orange juice? Orange juice in the blender, you know. Hey, I'd like, um, I'd like a mimosa. All we have is the good champagne. These are my business partners. I like good champagne. Hi, there. Hi. Wait a minute. That is not an American word. F-I-L-I-P. That's not how you spell that. Look it up. I will look it up. This is a Scrabble game. Isn't this a nice house? You wanna sit down? No. Hmm. So, what do you two desperate characters got to offer? Shitass. Shit, shit, shiteree. I've got money. I don't have it with me, though, of course. Spell that. If I had the letters, I would. Well, where is it? It's hid out. I mean, is it in a bank or traveler's checks, postal money orders, stamps or what the fuck? I've got it. You've got it? How much? $6,000. That's a lot. Why would I give a shit? I don't know. Maybe you wanna get out of here. You wanna get out of here, Art? Sure. I just don't want you to go to court against my brother. That's all. What's your name, amigo? George. How do you feel about this, George? Good. I feel good. I'm glad to hear it. Why? Hmm? Why should I testify against anybody? I haven't clone anything. Nobody's lookin' for me. Why should we trust you for a goddamn minute? Maybe I should just blow your fuckin' heads off, huh? Why not? Put you out of my misery. Or maybe I should just do this, blow my fucking brain out! You know, maybe then I could think clearer. Huh? You don't have to trust anybody. How can that possibly be? Doesn't the whole world work on trust? You get half first. I'll get you the rest right after. Don't. No. Don't cause me any anxiety, okay? Good. Because how am I gonna get it? Are you gonna mail it to me? What's my address? P.O. box dumbfuck? I'll mail it. You just tell me where to. Isn't that a trust of sorts? I'll do it. You get half first. I promise. You promise? I trust her. Well, you're trusting. Look at who you're married to. All right, I'll tell you what. Where're you two sleeping? Hmm? Where? At the Lazy KT Motel. Right on the main drag. Okay, I' tell you what. You be there tonight at 8:00. If I'm in the neighborhood, maybe we can conduct some business. If not, maybe I'll blow you off. How's that sound? Sounds fine. Fine. Is that fine? That's what you wanted, wasn't it? Yes. Good. You, too, George? Sure. Are you two gonna play a trick on me? Are you gonna ruin Bob's day? No. Mmm-mmm. Then get the hell out of here. I gotta call somebody. I gotta call my travel agent, okay? Nina, could you show them out? Okay. Hey, listen, you kids are not dressed for the weather. If I had a coat I'd give it to you. It's supposed to rain like sheets. Well, I need a ticket now. Okay. All right. Maybe I just ought to give it all to him right away. Bob might have a hard time gettin' into it, get pissed off. No. Go with the deal. He gets the other $3,000 when you send him the key. That way if your brother didn't get out like he's supposed to, you're not wiped out. How'd you get so smart? I'll show you somethin' else, too. Now you have an option. See, 93's got the money in. 41's got air. Here. No, no. You keep the real one. Oh, I don't trust myself for some reason. Well, I got the shakes just all of a sudden. You can deal with this better than I can. You hope. Don't get drunked up on beer, for Christ's sake. This is important to me. I might need you for something. I don't buzz up on beer. Oh, you're a tough guy. You're a tough guy. Mmm-hmm. Give me a drink out of it. Oh! It's you, now. Mmm, I just don't think so. I don't think this is a great idea. What does it matter, huh? Just do a thing. Do it cold. I don't care. Hot or cold. Whatever. You poor thing. You're lost, but you think you're found. That's terrible. Hi, kids. You ready to go? I'm ready. Where's Bob? Oh, we're gonna drive you there to meet him. He's waitin' for us. George is coming with us. Well, that wasn't the plan, hon. That wouldn't be a very good idea tonight. No deal, then. I need him. Okay, then. Hurry up. We don't wanna take all night. Where's Bob? We're going to see Bob now. Now, then, are you two related? No. Oh, I thought maybe you were. You sort of... sort of favor each other. Don't you think? Yeah. Mmm. Where're you from? Uh, Montana. Oh, that's nice. That's a nice place to raise a family, I think. Everything's so, so simple up there. You can... can see everything so clear up there is how I'd imagine it. Yeah, that's right. Art and I've been married four years. Though we lived together for a time before that. What, about a year, hon? Yup. I got two kids from another marriage, too. They live in San Antonio, Texas, which is a city of? City of canals. You know, I'd have another kid, too, if I thought that Art wanted one. I would do it. Why not? Kids are great. Hmm. Art and I are probably old enough to be you two's parents. Art's probably old enough to be one of my parents. What line of business are you in? Insurance. I used to work for a company that... that insured oil wells. The oil business. What's out here? Just a well site. Nothin' important. What do you like to do, son? Box. So, you can protect yourself pretty good? Yeah, I can take care of myself, yeah. Can you protect yourself against one of these? Art. Oh, he's always like this. That can clear the room of assholes. I... I don't know see why we need guns. This is not a gun thing. Don't you worry, sweetheart. It's all right. Art always carries a gun. He'd take a gun to the grocery. I don't see Bob out here. He's always late. Okay, come on out, little Miss Priss. Come on. You, too, son. Oh, my... Oh... Yeah, Bob had an accident. He wanted Nina and him to take your money and leave me in, uh, in the house in a condition that wouldn't make me happy. That was part of the accident. She's not that type. Nina loves me. So, here he is. Here's Bob. Well, what am I supposed to do? Take him out, and drag him over to the oil cap, which isn't on, and cap the well with Bob. It'll be easy. You, you can help, too. Oh, you don't have to if you don't want to, hon. He can do it. Art got him in there, for heaven's sakes. Uh! Come on. Come on. Come on. Drag it yourself. Uh! Okay, just pick up the boards. They're not nailed down. It'll keep him warm. It's blowy as shit out here. That's enough! Don't give me any lip. No! What... What the fuck is this shit? Oh, God, Art. Don't hit her! You think this is some fuckin' cowboy movie? Huh? I'll kill you dead as shit! How's Miss Priss? Here, honey. You take... You take that Kleenex and you wipe your blood off there.

Here it is. Here. You okay? Are YOu okay? $3,000. Oh, where's the rest of it? Huh? I know there's more than that. I want all of it. That wasn't the deal. There isn't any deal! The deal's in a hole over there! We... We're supposed to tell you when Johnny got out of jail. He ain't gettin' out. Huh? He killed this pipe fitter out in Natrona. He hates goddamn pipe fitters. Huh? He ain't gettin' out. I guess he forgot to tell you two. - He did. - Yeah. He stabbed this guy with a screw driver. I seen him do it. Okay, I want the rest of the money, sweetheart. A lot of dead people out here. No one's gonna notice you two. You have the key? Give him the key. Do you have the key? Huh? Huh? Here it is. Here it is. What the hell is that? Your locker room key? Is that the key to your locker? He did not. No, uh, no, it... it's in the bus station. I don't wanna go there. I've been in too many bus stations. You want... You want the rest of the money? I just hate bus stations. Just get the cuffs out of the glove box, Nina, huh? Okay, over there. Let's go. Where? Where? Come on, over there! Come on. Come on. Ah. Is that too tight, hon? I don't want to cut off your circulation. You hit her too hard, Art. She's shivering. I can't believe you tried to hit me with that plank. What? If I don't find the money in the box, I'm comin' out here by myself, kid. If I do, maybe, uh, maybe somethin' nice will happen for ya. You kids'll be okay here. I just don't think we should leave 'em out here, exposed like that. Don't you? No, no, I think we should take 'em with us. Oh, do you want me to leave you here with them? No. I don't want that. No. Well, then, just catch a ride with me. Can you climb through on your side? Huh? Um, okay. No, I can't. It's all right. Huh? Huh? Well, fuck it then! Ah! I'm so cold now. Frozen. Here, here. Fold your hand in. Fold your hand in! Listen, you okay? Mmm-hmm. Huh? Yeah. I need to start a fire. No. Do you have matches? You'll burn us up. Here. Ah! There. I want to tell you I did not go down on your friend, Klaus or Clark, I guess. I didn't believe that anyway. He... He did ask me to marry him, though. Oh, I can see you married to somebody. Who to? Who? You? No. Not me. Somebody else. Okay- Qkay. Who? I'm so cold. Georgie, I'm so cold. Oh, I feel blue. I must be blue. Blue? Could you just... Don't sleep. I could marry you. I could. What are you two doing here? This one's cold. I'll take care of everything. Thank you. That's right, ma'am. Well, you've had a time haven't you? Yeah, I did. So, tell me what's on your mind? What are you gonna do about her brother? Don't think about that boy now. He's in another world from you. Tell me what else you got on your mind. Home. I guess I'll go home. Done enough damage, you figure? Had enough fun? I've clone enough. You just couldn't stand to have any more fun, could ya? That's right. What else? Well, then, let her RIP, I guess, son.

I never reached your dad. He's probably working. He probably is. But you ought to go home. You could go in the wrong direction pretty easily now. It might not seem like it. It doesn't exactly seem like it. I haven't wanted to ask you a whole lot of questions about everything, you may have noticed. You could've called me a lot quicker, though. I could've gotten you out of juvenile hall. I'm your next of kin. Yeah. Oh! That poor girl, though. I'd like to ask you about, you know, how you got with her ancl that other man, that man in the hole, and those other two people? How you got with them? You could've gotten killed. I guess so. You wouldn't have been the first. Luck, I guess. Not luck I'd want. Bad luck. I heard from your mother. Where is she? She called from down in Rock Springs. I don't know the particulars. She wanted me to, uh, wire her some money, which I did. She wants to see you. I don't know what to tell you, George. She's your mother. Okay. You know, I don't wanna go home now. I just think I'll stay sittin' here and you go on. I'll call somebody. Harl's nuts today. I may have to leave him myself pretty soon. I can't always take it, even though I love him. It's catching, isn't it? Bus number 14, westbound to Boise, Coeur d'Alene, Spokane, and Seattle, will be leaving in five minutes. When's your next bus to San Francisco? Uh, 10:00, tonight.
