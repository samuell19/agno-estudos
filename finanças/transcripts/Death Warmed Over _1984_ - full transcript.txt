(ominous music) (dramatic music) (dramatic music) (foreboding music) (huffing) (siren alarming) (ominous music) - Hi, Michael. Wonderful news about your father's award. He's with Dr. Howell right now. - Okay, thanks. (ominous music) - It's the proof! The results are conclusive! - It's too early to draw any conclusions. - What do you mean, it's too early?! It's here in black and white! Are you bling to this, man?! Jesus, Tucker! The process works now, can't you see? The rats were enabling us to open a way to extend life. You seem oblivious to this breakthrough! - This mutation strain is basically still untested. We haven't a clue where it's leading us. You're going too far! - There's no evidence of any side effects to the rats. - Oh? And what about the LB-50 model? You know the autopsy showed there was massive internal haemorrhaging before they died. Before they died! (ominous music) You monitored the four stages of deterioration yourself. - You know what you're doing, don't you? You're sabotaging my work and I don't like it. - I resent this! - You made one big mistake! You're in it with me. Our salvation belongs to medical engineering. - No! Death is final! - We are the new messiahs! We will be wearing the most beautiful of white coats, not in insane asylums but in chemical, biological laboratories! If you choose to stop me, I have no choice but to make you obsolete! I'll show you the finality of death! (groaning) I am just beginning! (menacing music) (gasping) - sorry. - You're all sweaty. Let's get you cleaned up. (sombre music) (water trickling) (ominous music) (yelping) It's all right, Michael. - [Michael] what're you doing to me? - Trust me. It's okay. (ominous music) we are the generation of the end. I am just beginning. (menacing music) (eerie music) (ominous music) - [TV Announcer] At a press conference today, Professor Raymond Tucker and Dr. Archer Howell were the recipients of the Rothschild Award for scientific-- - Hey, do you know the time? - [Tucker] Come and look at this. - Hmmm? - Just as microchip technology could never have been envisioned 100 years ago. So now a man is on the brink of his own mortality. For this to succeed, we have to make a commitment to challenge, to risk. To be willing to pay the price of taking those risks by going further than man ever dreamt of. We are entering a new age. We are the generation of the end. And nothing is going to stop me. - The fool! He's mad! How dare he. - Ray, what is it? Darling, what's wrong? - I just don't like Howell's vision of a new world where death has become an obsolete word. (sombre music) - If you ask me, he looked like death warmed up. (chuckling) You're tired. I want you to relax. This is an important night for both of us. - He's changed, Netty. - The Rothschild Award for scientific advancement. Do you know something? - Hmmm? - I am just so proud of you. - He frightens me. - I want you to forget. (ominous music) (engine rumbling) (eerie music) (foreboding music) (moaning) (thudding) - Michael. (chuckling) - Is that you, Michael? (ominous music) (thudding) (Netty gasping) Michael!

Cranium infuser. (heart monitor beeping) (drill buzzing) (saw screeching) (ominous music) (rapid beeping) Forceps. Quickly! (rapid beeping) (ominous music) (screaming) (sombre music) (seagulls squawking) - Hi. Do you guys want a cold drink? - Yeah, great. Yeah I would. (laughing) - well, later on, Jeannie. We're just gonna have a look at the view. - Okay. (sombre chiming music) - [Guy] sure is hot. - Yeah. It's a wonderful idea, Lucas. (chuckling) (laughing) - Good day. Mind if I take a look? - Sure. - It's a great boat. - [captain] Don't get much private trade now. Tourists have dropped right off since they've got the open plan. - Open plan? - Yeah, the big psychiatric hospital. The biggest in the country. Are you visiting relative there? - No. Tell me' there's an old colleague of my father's I wanna look up, name of Howell. Archer Howell. - Dr. Howell, yeah. He's the head of the institution. He's a great bloke. - Do you know about the World War II tunnels? - Don't wanna go down there, son. - Why? - Oh, just wouldn't be seen dead there, know what I mean? I wouldn't go camping there either, if I was you. Stick to the hotel. Be a lot safer. (seagulls squawking) (giggling) (ominous music) - [Man] I'll give her one. - Give her my tongue, aye? (radio beeping) - [Radio Man] Z-K4, Z-K4. Jackson, here, at the institute, boys. Request notification of whereabouts, over. - Give me that. We're on the ferry, we'll be there in about an hour. (seagulls squawking) - come on, let's go in the car. (boat horn blowing) (laughing) (guys giggling) - [Passenger] I like the smell of blonde pussy in the morning. (giggling) (huffing) (moaning) (laughing) very nice. (sombre music) - Hey, Michael? You realise, Jeannie knows nothing about this. - Oh, Jesus, it's not the dirty dozen, you know. - No, I don't know. Just. - What? I've got a score to settle. - Someone's gonna get hurt. And you're dragging Jeannie into this. - She's cool, Lucas can handle that. - I think we should all talk about it. It's only fair. - I'm innocent! (ominous music) I hate him. (huffing) (moaning) (laughing) (eerie music) (Jeannie giggling) (giggling) - Buzz off, creep! - Have you got your tickets, then? (creep burping) - [Michael] what's happening? - Got a bit of a pervert. - You all right, man? - Are you? - Definitely a worry. - Get inside! (laughing) I told you to stay away from the girlies! - Please, I'm burning up inside. Get me to... ow! (gurgling) - Just stay cool. Don't look out on the deck again! (burping) (ominous music) - Burning inside me. Don't know what's going on. - Have you checked the markings on that van? - Yeah, I had a look. - Isn't that the weirdest guy? (ominous music) (gurgling) (gagging) (eerie music) (gurgling) (groaning) - oh, God. (urination trickling) somebody's pissing on our van. Let's go!

(laughing) - This is the last ferry, spikes, and you and I are on it. Ain't that a shame? - [spikes] I know. (thudding) - Oh, shit, you buggers. (thudding) - Michael, come on, let's go.

But there are others out there who haven't even started. Come. I'll show you. (eerie music) You see. Michael. The genetic recombination. It's mutated. I can't stop it. - I don't wanna hear anymore of that shit now. - Now, Michael, you must realise that I must survive that this is to be stopped.
