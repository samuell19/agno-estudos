Shawn, Vikram's here. I told you a million times, Dad, he goes by Vik. He goes by Vik. Vik, it came! - What'd you get? - Um- "Gamera 3"? Oh, the subbed "Mononoke Hime"? What, what is that? It's "Go! Great Decisive Battle At the End of the Century with Rainbows." Rainbows? Daisuke Ogata's forgotten anime masterpiece. Lost in a warehouse fire, but rumored to survive on the black market. You know, "Go." No, I don't know "Go." We have to watch this with her. You wanna show that to her? Look, nobody in Japan, much less Oklahoma, has seen this. Think about how impressed she'll be that we know so much about her country. You do know she's a girl, right, Shawn? Yeah? What does that matter? It matters. It's so awesome your family is hosting a Japanese exchange student. My dad would never do that. Dude, why are you always so down on your dad? He doesn't understand anything. He can't even tell the difference between Japan and China. Well, at least he's around. I haven't seen my dad in a month. Are you sure that's the right movie? Well, yeah. The title says "Iké." - Icky? - Yeah, yeah, "ee-kay." The imperative for "Go." I thought "Iké Man" meant like, hot guy. - "Ikémen." - Ooh. Oh, that's, uh, my bad there. How do you say "eat a dick" in Japanese? This guy. I heard your dad fixed my shitter last night to pay the rent. I heard your dad used your trust fund to buy your mom new tits. What did you just say? Huh? Watch yourselves, losers. Come on. What's the point of doing karate if you're not gonna use it? I know, I know. The Bible is like a football game. You always root for the underdogs. Moses versus Pharaoh, Job versus Satan, David versus Goliath. But who would you say is the biggest underdog in the whole Bible? Jesus. Y2K isn't for another week, but I wanna die now. I have a sai. Uh, what? A sai. It's a ninja weapon to, you know, kill you? You, you just said you wanted to die- Mr. Kapoor, can you name one of the beatitudes? Uh... What? Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the earth. Blessed are the geeks, for they shall inherit the earth. I still say you can do better. No woman is better than Bethany. Megumi Odaka is so much better. What real woman? Megumi Odaka is a real woman. She's an actress who played a psychic that can talk to Godzilla. But you do raise a good point. Speaking telepathically to kaiju like Godzilla is pretty sexy. If I were a kaiju, maybe I could get it on with her. She's a mind reader. She'd see through anything superficial you try. Oh, just let me have my fantasy. A night with a sexy Asian chick. Followed by smashing Tokyo. Why? Don't you wanna sometimes just like, smash everything like a kaiju? No, actually. I'd rather be a mecha. A mecha? Why would you wanna be a mecha? 'Cause I could shoot lasers, fly. You know, come and save the day. You're afraid of fire and heights, Shawn. That's not the point. The point is the mecha are the hero. Who wants to be the villain? You hate being the center of attention. Every time someone calls on you in class, you start sweating like a pickle. Come on, Vik. Let me have my fantasy. You have yours. Shouldn't you have a fantasy that might actually come true? Why can't this one come true? Because we're nerds in the middle of friggin' Oklahoma. ♪ If I ever get back to Oklahoma ♪ ♪ Gonna nail my feet to the ground ♪ ♪ Too many stones are in my path ♪ ♪ Been trippin' and fallin' down ♪ I hope she likes it. - Likes what? - The movie. Enough about the movie. You should be worried about whether or not she wants to hang out with a couple of weirdos like us. You're late, Vikram. We're counting on you to help with the Japanese translation, Shawn. I've studied Japanese, too. Yeah, but you suck at it. Shut up. - You shut up. - Would you two stop fighting? This is her first time in America. We want to make a good impression. Why would anyone wanna spend their Christmas vacation in Oklahoma? Nothing happens in Oklahoma. It's not a vacation; it's a holiday study abroad. And who requests an Indian host family? This girl must be a weirdo. Is that her? Yeah. Miki? Hello, my name is Miki Shimizu. And I am Sun it a. Nice to meet you. Oh, it's nice to meet you. - I said that right? - No. Yes, well, welcome to Oklahoma. I'm sorry our parents couldn't be here. They had to go to India for this family thing. - India? - Yeah. Almost as far away as you. Gosh, you must be exhausted. Here, come, this way. Let me show you to your room. - No. Wait, come on. - Leave it. - We could check in on her. - Let go. - What if she doesn't know- - Let's go back, come on. - Let go. No, no. - Come on. No, she does, obviously. Hey, Miki. Wanna see my room? It has a lot of Japanese stuff in it. - Mm. - Woo! Welcome to the Vik cave. What do you think? Don't scare her. What is this? No. What's your favorite anime? "The Lion King." "Lion King"? What's your favorite "Lion King" character? Simba. Me too. Dude, dude, where are the subs? I don't think anyone's had a chance to translate yet. It's been 30 years. Dude, 1999? As in this year? Of course. It's "Go! Great Decisive Battle at the End of the Century with Rainbows." Told you so. They're saying something about a sacred fire? Blood from a hero's sacrifice. No, no, no. - Finish? - Well, that's it? No, there must be a mistake. There's... There's no way it just ends without an ending. What a load of horsesh... Uh, good morning. - Get up. Get it off. - Ow, ow, ow. I feel weird. I feel like I just worked out. You haven't worked out a day in your life. That's exactly my point. Ooh. Vik blew up the TV. Vik, what did you do? I, I just woke up. Well, you'll be cleaning up this mess after school. This is school? For rich kids. Or smart kids with scholarships. Does anyone have any questions for Mickey here? Come on, let's get those hands up. Hunter. - Yes. Is it true you sell used panties in vending machines? Vending machines don't... They don't... Detention. It's the last day before break. Actions have consequences, Hunter. Anyone else? - What? God, come on. Bethany. Why did you choose Oklahoma? Ah. Oklahoma is most, mm, many Indian in America. Understand? That's right. That's right. Oklahoma has the most Native American tribes in all of America. I love Indian culture, so I ask Indian home stay. Oh. Yeah, the Kapoors are, uh, Indian... You know, Indo and Indian, in Japanese it can be confused. I'm pretty sure it was just a clerical error. I'm fine, Shawn. - Oh, it's not that, I just- - Ooh. Hey, Kapoor, are you taking your sister to the pow-wow? Ho, ho, ho, ho. Please stop. Uh, what? You are not nice. Hey, the Yellow Ranger here has more balls than both of you. Who knew? Why don't you go to hell, Hunter? And why don't you join Hunter and me in detention, Mr. Kapoor. Thank you, sir. Great. Uh, have a good time. I guess, come with me to karate? Give me that Frisbee. What are you in for? Smoking. Cool. Ichi, ni, san, shi, go. Ichi, ni, san, shi, go. Rei! Yes, Newt-sensei. Alright. Now, in honor of our guest hailing all the way from the birthplace of Japan, the birthplace of karate, which is in Japan, I would like to demonstrate an original move, uh, hailing from right here in Oklahoma that I created myself. And I will demonstrate all by myself. But I'm gonna need a volunteer. Um... Shawn-kun, come on down. Good initiative there. Alright, uh, it's called the "Do-Kan," which in Japanese, I believe, means ka-boom. What we do is we distract the opponent with one hand... Other hand. We strike the opponent with, uh, this hand here, and, uh, and we're gonna strike with the right, okay? But before we do that, we drop in with the spatula, we're gonna flip the flapjack, we're gonna come back, and boom! And that is the "Do-Kan." ♪ Still off the hook ♪ ♪ Over the line ♪ ♪ I keep you reeled in, rockin' so fine ♪ ♪ It's fishin' time ♪ ♪ And everybody's knows my name ♪ I'm gonna stop by the faculty holiday party before the Christmas cookies are spoken for. Stay in your seats until I get back. Incoming, Ka-pooper. Oh my God. Y2K can't come soon enough. You'd be better practice over Christmas. Just like Santa... And remember, it's not who you are; it's what you do that makes you a hero. A rig a to. Now get. Is that my gorgeous wife? Miki and I had a nice talk. Oh, welcome to Tamashi Dojo. Care to see our bonsai collection? It's a little industry joke. Oof. Your name's Vikram, right? It's, um, Vik with a K. Behold the ancient burial site. With the return of the Old Gods, a new Eden will be born. Dude, where have you been? I've been calling you all night. It's Christmas vacation, dude. You're lucky I'm awake at all. Didn't I say this was important? I know. You mentioned that all 10 messages. Why couldn't you just tell me? You're gonna have to see it for yourself. You woke me up early, man. I don't get it. When I was at karate, I was like, copying Newt-Sensei's move. Dude, you did "Ultram an." But can you do "Kamen Rider"? - What? Woo! That film did do something to us. No duh. Isn't it awesome? - What does it mean? - Well, I think it means... "Ebirah, Horror of the Deep!" Vik, stop screwing around. This is bad- - You mean badass. Ooh. Watch where you point that thing. We've gotta figure out what's happening to us. Dude, chill. I can't chill. I'm freaking out. How are you not freaking out right now? Shawn, for now, can't you just enjoy being awesome? It's not every day we get superpowers. Yes, but just name one tokusatsu where gaining superpowers didn't come with a world-ending problem. Okay, point taken, but we're in Oklahoma. What can possibly happen here? The fire is the latest in a series of attacks by a millennial doomsday cult known as the Children of the Old Gods. Can't they give this end-of-the-world bull a rest? Remind me again how I say grace in her language? Uh, Itadakimasu. Eat-a-ducky-mess. No, it's itadakimasu. Yeah, that's what I said. Eat-a-ducky-mess. Let's, let's just try not saying it. Okay. Whatever. Just trying to get something right. I'm gonna set the table. Why don't you put the bird in? Ah. Merry Christmas. Come on in. Merry Christmas. Hey, Mr. Gunderson. Let me grab that from you. Thank you very much for having me. Oh, you're very welcome. I hope we can show you a Christmas to tell your family about back in China. Sorry, Japan. Don't, don't tell Shawn I said that. - Are your sisters coming? - Nope. They're gonna spend Christmas with their friends, thank God. Oh, that just means more for us. You make yourself at home. Vikram, kitchen. Real men cook. Yes, sir. ♪ Laughing all the way, ha, ha, ha ♪ ♪ Bells on bobtails ring ♪ ♪ Making spirits bright ♪ ♪ What fun it is to ride and sing ♪ ♪ On a sleighing song tonight ♪ ♪ Oh, jingle bells, jingle bells ♪ ♪ Jingle all the way ♪ ♪ Deck the halls with boughs of holly ♪ ♪ Fa, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la ♪ ♪ 'Tis the season to be jolly ♪ Did you ask her yet? It's Christmas break. Give it a rest. Miki-san... Alright, kids, stop talking in code. Gentlemen, wanna check on the big bird? Oh, this is my fault. I zapped the oven. I broke the oven. We could do a sushi turkey. Get it? 'Cause... - How do you like Oklahoma? - Uh, Indian people not here? Oh, nonsense. They're all over the place. Ah, where can I find them? Everywhere. They own all the casinos. - Casino? - Casinos. Ah. Hey. Oh, you should do your "Do-Kan" thing. No, it might explode. How's it looking? Are we close in there? It's Christmas turkey. You gotta. Oh, fine. Stand back. What's the word? Alright. Let's get fat. Don't forget the casserole. Ah. - Your hands cold, bud? - No. Well, how you plan to eat with those on? No, I'm just- Enough with the cosplay. Let's eat. Merry Christmas. - Merry Christmas. Eat-a-ducky-mess. Come on. Well, hello there, Miki-Angelo. Indians, huh? Okay. Wanna see Indians? Wow. It's really cool that you know so much about Native American culture. I've lived here my whole life and never even thought about 'em. You think I'm cool? Yeah. Hey there. Hey, are you okay? Indian people are dead. Uh, some are. Actually, many. Are you okay? Excuse me. Uh... Hello? Hey, is this Vik with a K? Yeah, who's this? This is Bethany from school. Oh, yeah. Hi, Bethany. So, what are you doing? Uh... What? I mean, do you wanna like, hang out? Yo. Vik, I am freaking out. Where are you right now? I, I just... I, I got a thing. What do you mean, a thing? Just, just, it's just something important. Something important? Vik, I'm in trouble. You're a smart kid. You'll figure it out- - Hey. - Ooh. Vik? Uh... Sup. - Sup? - It's short for "what's up?" Yeah, I know. Come on. We're not renting a movie? Damn it! Whoa! You know, you're fun. I thought you were a huge nerd. What a, what a mean rumor. Why do you hang out, like, all the time, with that weird kid? The one who's, like, into Japanese cartoons. We just, uh, study sometimes. He really brings you down. Whoa! I think they were trying to kill me. They had scythes. Like what? Scythes? Like Deathscythe Gundam. - Oh. - And they were digging something out of the ground. It was just like the film. Here, I got a whole bunch of, um, websites about "Go" over here. I can't understand all of the kanji, but it says something about a prophecy. The last days of the Millennium, 1999. Right now. Cool. Cool? That's it? - Yeah, why? - I'm turning into the mecha from the movie, and you're transforming too. You're transforming into- Goku. No, Goku wasn't in the film. But there was a kaiju and there's a mecha. And I'm turning into the mecha. So that only really leaves- Stop it. So what? So what? So everything. Mecha fight kaiju. And it gets worse. It says something about blood from a hero's sacrifice and a sacred fire to awaken the Old Gods. The Old Gods seem to be important in all this, so we just need to figure out what happens- Shawn, Shawn, Shawn, Shawn, Shawn, Shawn, Shawn. You're looking at this all wrong. You're turning into a mecha. I just went on a date with friggin' Bethany. That doesn't happen to guys like us. What do you mean, guys like us? I gotta spell it out for you? Losers. We're not losers. Yes, we are. Or I was, but not anymore. Okay, but regardless if we are losers or not, I need your help with this. - Come on. - Like, I need you, Vik. No one understands or cares about this kind of stuff, except for us. Except for you. What do you mean? Anime's your thing, not mine. How can you say that? It's not my life. I outgrew it a long time ago. Then why watch all these movies then? Like, buy all these action figures? Because you were into it. And that was cool for a while, but I can't like something simply because you do. I gotta be my own person. Okay, we'll watch less anime, but this, this is distracting us. We... It doesn't matter. No, no, no, no, it does matter. Why won't you just let me have this, Shawn? Because this isn't you. Yes, it is. Or it will be, if you stop dragging me down. You think I drag you down? Look, the old me wasn't working. Don't screw this up for me. Hey, dorks. Japanese girls are so petite. Should I wear this to my recital? Where's Miki? She got upset that you were arguing and wanted to leave so I lent her my bike. - You did what? - Where did she go? Do you need a ride? Mm. Thank you, Mr. Gunderson. Don't mention it. I'm just glad to see Shawn making a new friend. Mm. I love most of the things about his school, but making friends? Let's just say his peer group has very different home lives than him. Sometimes I don't get my own kid. Maybe I'm not trying hard enough. Hell, maybe I'm trying too hard. But I do worry about him, especially since his mom passed away. Shawn, is a good boy. Yes, he is. I had to buy a sweatshirt. Don't worry, we're not talking about you. Much. They are discovering their powers. They could defeat our masters. We must destroy them. No, we will make them destroy each other. Vik, you have known about this. You complained when I didn't get you your own hotel room. I'm sorry if I don't wanna drive to Dallas for two nights to watch little kids do some stupid dance performance. It's not stupid. Yes, it is. Bite me. - Bite yourself. - We can hang out later. No, no, no, no, no. I wanna hang out with you now. I'm going to hang out with you now. Fine. Be a jerk. Come on, we're gonna be late. So you're gonna be home alone. Yeah. Why? Newt-sensei, I didn't know who else to turn to. Well, let me see if I can translate it for you. The director, Daisuke Ogata, used to be a big deal. Almost as big as Kurosawa. Then he said he had a vision for the future he had to turn into an anime. Only a big otaku would find this stuff. Apparently, Ogata was making a prophecy about the end of the Millennium. When the world would be destroyed unless a hero rises and saves it. But the hero can only be born if he watches this movie. That can't be right. But there was no ending to the movie. It just cut off. And why was the maiden tied to the post? The sacred fire? The Old Gods? Shawn-kun, you're over thinking it, man. The monster will destroy the world at the end of the Millennium unless a hero slays him. Mechas fight kaiju. ♪ Her name is Yoshimi ♪ ♪ She's a black belt in karate ♪ ♪ Working for the city ♪ ♪ She has to discipline her body ♪ ♪ 'Cause she knows that it's demanding ♪ ♪ To defeat those evil machines ♪ ♪ I know she can beat them ♪ Look at them. Is it this bad in Japan too? - Bad? Wouldn't it just be great when it's all over? No more losers telling us how it has to be. I don't understand. I like Oklahoma. Then you really are special. Look, I used to be just like you. A scrawny loser, no friends. Why do you think I joined the Navy? 'Cause no other job would take me. Alrighty. You get in horse stance, would you, please? Thank you. So then I went to Japan, and everything changed. I was, I was walking tall. Literally, I was the tallest person walking around. Felt fantastic. Nothing was the same. And look at me now. I'm the guy I wanted to become when I was your age. But I couldn't be him until I decided to change. I had to decide to change, right? And I could not change until I got rid of all the people who made me who I was. And I brought in the people who made me who I am today. I am the hero of my own story. And you could be too. What is it I always say? It's not- - It's not who you are, but what you do. That's right. It's what you do. It's what you do that makes you a hero. Come on up there, mittens. Miki? You alright, Shawn-kun? A rig a to, sensei. A rig a to. Pick up. Come on. Show me your room. Are you, are you sure this is gonna work? Just trust me, honey. Alright. But what, what if he figures it out? You do your part. I'll do mine. Alright. Alright. What's this robot guy? Oh, that's a mecha. They shoot lasers and fly. And this? That's a kaiju. They usually fight the mechas. They're the villain. Well, who wants to mess around with a robot? But kaiju? Kaiju are sexy. Bethany, um... What's the matter? Nothing, I, uh... I feel funny. Just go with it. Vik? Miki? Where are you guys? Vik? Why are you all staring at me? No, no, no. Alright, if you don't want to, that's okay, but don't bite me. I'm sorry, I didn't mean to. Oh, my god. Bethany, I'm sorry. I didn't mean it. I don't know what happened. Vik. Vik. What the... Uh... You! - Whoa. - You did this to me. You made us watch that film. - Vik, stop. Okay, calm down, Vik. We can figure this out. Figure what out? Look at me. I guess you're not in the mood to talk right now. Where do you think you're going, Shawn? Oh no. Oh no. Everything you said would happen came true, and then some. They're definitely gonna fight. And Nostradamus foretold that in the year 1999 there would come a King of Terror, the Antichrist, at the end of the Millennium. This please. What do you want? I think we should meet up. You better not chicken out this time. Shawn. Shawn. Where are you? Quit hiding. Dude, I can smell you. You smell like... You smell like a vinyl record. Hm. Uh, hey. There you are, you little weasel. Look, I'm sorry. I never should've made us watch that film. You really think this is about the film, Shawn? But you're a monster, Vik. Somebody has to stop you. What are you gonna do about it? You'll never be a hero, Shawn. You'll always be a coward. Stop saying that! Ugh, what the hell? I didn't think you'd actually do it. I'm sorry. The movie says I have to do this. This was never about the movie! Okay, maybe there's another way. Let's just think about this for a minute. It's too late. You have wings? Now that's what I'm talking about. You weren't there for me when I needed you, Vik. You're never there for me. I'm the only one who's there for you. Nobody likes you. No matter how hard you try, nobody's ever gonna like you. I hate you. And I hate you. I'm all you have. Look out! Vik. You think I'm cool? Yeah. Oh, Y2K. We have talked about it and talked about it and talked about it. Well, at midnight tonight, some storms are going to roll in from the southwest. The Millennium will be here. And you'll know it here in Oklahoma, because, let me tell you, it's stormy- You need to get below ground. If you don't, you might find your heinie in Kansas tomorrow. Hey, buddy. You awake? Okay. Maybe now's not a good time. Uh, yeah, you know what? I... I'm just gonna say it. I can tell something's eating at you. And believe it or not, I know what you're feeling. People will tell you that growing up is about change, but you don't change as an adult. You are who you are. And they won't tell you that. At least, nobody told me that, but it's true. Even if other people don't get it, hell, even if I don't get, just be yourself. I'm proud of who you are. Your mom would be proud too. I wish she was here to see who you've become. Who you've always been my hero, if I'm being honest. So, I guess you'll be spending New Year's with Vikram? Vik. Have a good time. Miki. Shawn? Let her go. Shawn-kun. - Newt-sensei? - You did it. I knew you'd survive. What, what's going on here? I got a better question for you, shaka Shawn. What are you? I'm a mecha? You're a loser. But you can change by helping me release the Old Gods. What about the movie? Our people had to destroy the film. We couldn't have an ending out there showing people how to defeat the Old Gods. But with you with us, nothing's gonna stop us. Now, come on, help us save the world. You made me kill my best friend. I won't be part of your world. You are really starting to disappoint me, Shawn-kun. Vik with a K! No. Jeez. You're not dead. Ah, just took a swim. Hey, uh, what I said... You were right. We have each other. Oh, Miki. Oh, oh. - Allow me. I got it. - Oh, please. - I can cut the laser- - No, look what happens. - Lasers cut- - I got it. - I got this. - Shawn, let me. I got the nails. Get them! Oh, gosh. Yes. Vik. Bethany? Why are you helping him? Because he's my friend. Ha! Vik! And he'll always hold you back. Shawn-kun. Mecha sword! Yee-ha! I don't wanna do this. You could have been my best student. I was your best student. Do-Kan! Ow, ow, ow. Well done, Shawn Wayne. Finish it. No. You're wrong, Newt-sensei. You never needed to change. You just had to be yourself. There's gotta be a better way. There is. No! Why did you do that? You are supposed to be one of us. One of the heroes. I am. Newt-sensei. Whoa, okay, okay. Okay, maybe you could stop? Vik? Oh, uh... Easy, lady. Uh, guys? Hero's blood. Oh, gosh. Oh, gosh. And sacred fire. Oh, loser. Whoa. Hey, where are you going? Miki, you killed it. I did it. Vision Quest. Guys? Uh, guys? Guys? Oh, gosh, is that supposed to glow? Shawn? Mecha, kaiju, it doesn't matter. If I'm gonna die, I'm glad we're together. Together. That's it! That's what? I think I figured out the ending to the movie. But it was destroyed. No, listen, you know how mecha combine into one giant robot? Yeah, to defeat a Kaiju. Yeah, but this movie is different. The kaiju isn't the villain, remember? Do you think we could do it? Do you have any other ideas? Nope. 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1. Vik! Vik. Shawn. Um... Where's Miki? Do you think she's naked too? From Paris to Tokyo to New York, all indications are that major national infrastructure remains intact after months or preparing for a Millennium Bug catastrophe. The White House Y2K chief- Was so pleased with himself, that he smoked a celebratory cigar.
