When it touches her spot, hit makes her... [grunts] Which makes me be like, "Oh!" - [laughter] - Yeehaw! Coming up on "Love & Hip Hop," it's a love thing. - I got this crazy story. Damn! I know that freak is still in there. Why do it smell like grown folks in here? We're looking back at some of the steamiest scenes in the past seasons. - Baby! - This what you want? Along with some heart-filled moments that got us a little choked up. I didn't wanna hold him up. Oh, my God, I'm getting emotional. Ooh, child. Plus a few that almost got \some folks choked out. Baby, this ain't \no TV [bleep]. You wanna be with somebody else, take yo' ass on and be with the weak-ass, broke-ass ho. - [laughs] - Stop that [bleep], Kendra. All while putting the love in "Love & Hip Hop." If that's what you gotta do \to warm up your motor... A girl's gotta do what a girl's gotta do. [laughs] I'm your host, Chris Spencer. Some of you may know me as a comedian... I need you to find a purse equivalent to the amount of money you're gonna have in the purse. You don't need a Louis Vuitton. You need a Larry Vuitton. Or as cohost of "Date Night" on SiriusXM with my better half, Vanessa. Like, this is what happens after all these years. But tonight, Vanessa and I are hanging out with some of your favorite "Love & Hip Hop" couples and some very special friends of the show. We're gonna play some sexy games... Y'all about to find out just how big the freak is in your partner. And reveal a side you've never seen before. They were the shortest strokes of my sexual history. [laughter] What if your partner wanted \to have an open marriage? We just gonna go ahead \and put it out here. - This is all news to me. I never knew. Wow. And it's all to celebrate Black love. Black love is understanding that it's bigger than you. - Black commitment. \Black loyalty. I'm rocking with you no matter what. So bring out the candles, dim the lights, and pour a little drink. It's time for "Love & Hip Hop: It's a Love Thing." Woot-woot! ♪ Wedding people, put up the steeple ♪ ♪ Papoose out ♪ - [laughs] - Oh! It's lit. [both laugh] [hip-hop music] ♪ ♪ \- ♪ You know this feels right ♪ ♪ So right, so right ♪ Welcome to "Love & Hip Hop: It's a Love Thing." I'm your host, Chris, and this is my beautiful wife, Vanessa, and we're the Spencers. "Love & Hip Hop" is known for bringing their fair share of drama, but at the heart of it all, there's always a lot of love. Tonight, we're celebrating both by sipping and playing a few sexy games to help us all get to know each other better. Hit's about to be a fun date night after dark. Let's say what's up \to our couples. You know we couldn't have a conversation about Black love without having the ambassadors of Black love themselves from New York. Remy Ma and Papoose, what up? - Hey, guys. \- Hi. - Peace, y'all. What's going on? - Looking very lovely. I love that animal print. Feeling a little wild tonight. - Oh! Uh-oh. [laughter] Well, we haven't seen this couple since season five of "Hollywood." Let's welcome newlyweds Brooke Valentine and Marcus Black. - What up, y'all? - How y'all doing? - Hey, guys. Hey. We're the Spencers, but y'all look like \the Expensives. - \[laughter] - I'll take it. Well, I don't know if we call her a friend of the franchise, because she's more like a cousin. Please welcome Tami Roman and her husband Reggie Youngblood. - Both: Hey. - What's up with it? "- Reggie, how do you still look h6'6" sitting down? Hey, man, just a big dude, bro. I can't hide it.

He's never, ever walked \barefoot in his life. - HLook at him. - I got him on those pedicures. I make sure he get his pedicures two times a month. Joc, I hear the morning show's going really well. - Congratulations on that. - Thank you. Which means that it has you getting up quite early in the morning. So, Kendra, does he roll over, tap you, \give you a little nudge to get some morning action before leaving for work? Sometimes he get up early and nudge me and we have to get a little, hyou know... - Like, get it in a little. - Kinda quickie before he go. Or sometimes she initiates it, and I wake up like, "What happened?" [laughter] It's kinda interesting because \Kendra, she's very feisty. Like, she has this whole façade, this professional attorney, but then at the house, she be like, "Ay. Wake yo' ass up. Come here." [laughter] Brooke and Marcus, do y'all play like that? - Hh-Yes. - She's definitely aggressive. \Brooke be like, "Where you going?" I'll be like, "I'm going to the studio." "Leave my [bleep] on the dresser." - \[laughter] - You feel me? Leave it home. Pap, what about Remy? In the beginning, you know, she couldn't keep her hands hoff me. Now that we married, she be trying to switch out, \and I'd be like, "I know that freak is still in there." - I gotta find it." - Uh-huh. Tami a meat yanker. She gon' pull on that. Ay. [laughter] She gon' tug on that... \on that gristle. And I gotta get all mines in. You know, I'm 17 years older hthan him. So I'm just gonna [bleep] htill I can't. - [laughter] - Time out, Stella.

You guys at home are welcome to pour yourselves a cocktail, maybe a little bubbly, and join the conversation \using #LHHLoveThing. - All right, let's do this. - Woot-woot! Whether it's in the bedroom or on the beach or in the bathtub... Or hanging from a strong-ass shower curtain rod... The "Love & Hip Hop" cast has never been shy about expressing their love on camera. ♪ ♪ [moans] You know what problem I have hright now? My [bleep] is like this [bleep] bottle. That's the problem \I got tonight. So what are we gonna do about it? ♪ ♪ I'm gonna take you in the bathroom right now and knock your screws loose. - [laughs] - Well, let's go. [moaning] Ooh, it's the nipple rub! - Our chat, girl. You know that. - Mm-mm. It's your night. You're fine. Get some lube. Is this working for you? You wanna help me take it off? I'd love to. - H- Oh. - Leave me alone. [laughs] ♪ ♪ I really do love you, Cyn. - HI do. - Oh, you're gonna make me cry. Rose Burgandy knows exactly how to keep your girl happy. I remember that. Really? They gon' play something dumb hhof me. I ain't gonna make it. H-[laughs] Don't be shy now. [squeals] Wait. Baby! - This what you want? - Yeah. Well, that's one way hto finish. - [laughter] - The best! That was not a good look. [laughter] \- Ah! That Joc and Karlie, boy. [laughs] - HThe perm! - That was my naturel, man. That boy was looking like all The Five Heartbeats. All five of 'em. I guess that's just what he was doing. I guess the chemicals got hto his head. I'm not sure. [laughter] So, Brooke, I gotta ask you, that was quite the little maid's outfit. Do you still have that? I still have it. - And where do you get 'em? H[laughs] I mean, I'm asking for a friend. I'm asking for a friend. [laughter] What about y'all? \Joc? Kendra? Well, for me, I liked... Hl actually... I was fond of all the scenes where the toes was \getting sucked, because it's kinda a form of flattery because I didn't see nobody on no TV nowhere doing it till they seen me. - That's who. Me. - Oh. - Suck some toes. - Okay. Trendsetter. Is it hard to be intimate on camera, Kendra? No, it's not hard. He is a very big PDA-er. He loves to kiss and touch and grab my ass in public, hall that. H- Be like, "Babe, you kinda messy." I be picking lint off of her stuff. - [laughter] - He don't. No, he don't. He take a whole handful like the potato salad. Like the potato salad. I'm not a big PDA person. You know what I'm saying? I'm a real private person. There was some clips on that, they sticking the whole tongue... Hgot tongue, like, 5, 6 inches wide and [bleep]. [laughter] Like, pull that [bleep] back in ha little bit. - Pull that back. Yeah, you half Godzilla. \- Remy and Pap, which one of you guys are more intimate off camera? - It's this guy. It's this guy here. Like, and I don't even think it's just about being intimate. He's just like a horny teenager hall the time. Like, when cameras is on, e's like, you know, "Oh, you know, I think Black love... Yeah, treat your woman like a queen." When the camera is off, he's, like, humping on my leg. [laughter] So tonight is all about the love, and we know an essential element to the romance is sexual chemistry. Okay, now, let's see ow much chemistry you guys have in the bedroom with a game we like to call... Now, everyone should have a red paddle and a black paddle for this game. We're gonna describe a sexy experience, and if you're down with it, you're gonna hold up the black paddle, which means "Black love, go." Or if you ain't feeling it, raise your red one, which means "hell to the no." Y'all about to find out just how big the freak is in your partner. Y'all ready? Grab your paddles. It's time to play Red Light, Black Love. So hit the strip club together? Of course. That's easy. Starting out with training wheels? - All right. All y'all nasty. That's great. [laughter] - Take me. Take me. I wanna go. Going to the strip club. Okay. Sex toys. - Yeah, we can use those. - [laughs] What about sex toys for him? What? - Yeah! - No! We need three more paddles. - Tami! [laughs] Well, hold on. HSex toys, it could be [bleep] rings, it could be feathers, it could be all kind of stuff. - Feathers? Yeah! That's why I threw up mine. - You plucking a chicken? What's happening? She said it though. HLike, there's this vibrating [bleep] ring, right, that feels good when she... When it touches her spot. - Yes. Yes. And when it touches her spot, it makes her... [grunts] Contract more, which makes me be like, "Oh," harder. [laughter] Okay, so let's get \to the next one. Do y'all watch porn together? [muttering] We don't do that. - You don't want to. I made you. We might reenact some hwe made up, but we ain't finna do it. Who makes porn together? Well, me and Kendra, we have a lot of videos. Yung Joc, it's so ironic hyou said that. - H- [laughs] - We have a clip. Take a look. - Uh-oh. - I'm joking. I'm joking. I'm joking. H[laughter] Ooh! Ain't nothing wrong with making your own video. Ain't nothing wrong with that. HWe got videos too. Yeah. I said, "Tell the truth," not about everything. Those that have little ones, \do you do it in the bedroom or anywhere the crib might be while the baby's asleep next to you? Oh, yeah. I don't understand the question, man. Just put your black paddle up. [laughter] He's over here, "I don't understand the question." I don't understand the question. - He means... - Can you elaborate? When the baby is sleep, \do you try to get it? Absolutely. It's like, wait until they grow up and watch this. - Mommy! [laughter] No, so let me tell you. So I asked him, 'cause... I'm like, "Oh, baby, hthe door locked?" But he's so thirsty, he like, "Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's locked, it's locked." - He just want me to shut up. - You know why? Because if I would've said \the door wasn't locked, she would've curved me, and then when I went to lock the door and come back, it would've been a new diversion, so I had to take advantage hof the moment. Five seconds later... you had to see how he ran. He ran like the cops knocked hat the door and we had bricks in the house. [laughter] All right, how about this? Have any of you guys ever messed around at your parents' house? What about at my grandma's hin Chicago? - His grandma house for sure. - Yeah. Grandma house count? I am the parents' house. [laughter] - Yes! - Ah! Can we go to a break? 'Cause we can't beat that. - That's game over. - Yeah. She dropped the mic! It's time for us to take a break. We'll have more "Love & Hip Hop:" "It's a Love Thing" after this. I do wanna know, when is the wedding date? We just gonna go ahead \and put it out here. - We been married. - What? - For real? - What? Black love is Black commitment. Black loyalty. I'm rocking with you no matter what. God, I'm getting emotional. Now, hold on. Y'all been sitting here lying to us all night. What else y'all lying about? When Chris proposed, \he surprised me. He flew my parents out. My brother was there. All of our friends had showed up. I didn't feel my best because he dragged me \out of a bathtub. I got on one knee, and I'm crying, and she's like, you know, "I guess." - I don't like... - Like, my wife don't cry. If my wife got shot, she'd be like, "Ah." [laughs] Ugh. It was beautiful. Now we've been married 15 years? - H- 15. - 15 years in June. Welcome back to "Love & Hip Hop: It's a Love Thing." Well, there's nothing more magical than finding your soul mate and asking them to spend the rest of their life with you. Joc and Kendra, you were recently engaged. Joc, I wanna ask you, "Were you nervous?" But I know you wasn't nervous. Actually, I was nervous. Word? I'ma keep it 1,000. \After I gave her the ring, if you really go back and look, I don't know if they showed it, but she was like, "Is this real?" - Hey, y'all! \[screams] [cheers and applause] Kendra Nicole Robinson... - Aww. - Yes! I wanna ask you to be my wife. - [sobbing] - Say yes, girl! - Put your hand out. Put your hand out. [all cheering] She said, "Are you serious?" And I looked at her and I said, "Baby, this ain't no TV [bleep]." - Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. - Well done, Joc. - Thank you. - Thank you. Thank you. Hey, listen, let me say this. I like y'all chemistry. I wanna compliment you on that. But I do wanna know... - Appreciate that. Thank you. I do wanna know, when is the wedding date? Well... So my name is Jasiel Robinson. [laughter] Her name is Kendra Robinson. And we just gonna go ahead and put it out here. From the very moment that y'all seen the whole "Love & Hip Hop," we been married. [record scratch] [laughs] - What? - For real? - Yeah. - Now hold on. Y'all been sitting here lying to us all night! What else y'all lying about? [laughter] Gotcha. We do naturally have the same names, but we are not married yet. - Aww. Why y'all doing us like that? - That was a good tease. That was a good tease. But because of COVID, we just got pushed back. We don't want people to catch COVID. We don't wanna catch COVID. \It's coming soon. Like, in 2021 for sure. It's coming soon like a mixtape coming soon? Or is it...[laughter] Tami, do you have a "Love & Hip Hop" favorite proposal? Um... honestly, I... [clears throat] [laughter] Although I love you, Marcus and Brooke... [laughter] The one that I cried on was hRemy and Pap's, only because I know what that meant to her and how long he had waited \to be able to do that. Just know that dedication, hhman. You know, she went, did her time. Pap stood by her side the whole time, man. That's beautiful. Finally, everything is where it needs to be. So beautiful. And I am about to marry \the man of my dreams. Remy wanted everything but the damn wig. - The hat. Oh, my God. - \I hated it so bad! - You hated that thing. You loved it. We really, really wanted this for so long, and he told me that he would be waiting for me, and there he is. - Hey. All right. Oh, golly! I now pronounce you usband and wife. - Yes! [cheers and applause] Yay for love. There's so much love in this room. I just feel so blessed hright now. [cheers and applause] - Aww. - Look at that. - Wow. Congratulations. - So beautiful. Let me ask you something: So while you were locked up, were you able to consummate the marriage? Oh. Oh. We had plenty of trailer visits. Yo, trailer visits was the best, man. They was amazing. We would really get to stay together for 48 hours. We'd play board games and stuff like that. Yo, soon as I come in, I used to wanna get right to it. But she wanted to play hard to get. She wanted to, like, wait. I used to be in my mind like... She wanted the foreplay. She wanted, like, the whole thing. She wanted the date, the dinner, yeah. So being that Pap is a big advocate of Black love, what does Black love mean h to you guys? To me, Black love is Black commitment. Black loyalty. I'm rocking with you no matter what, you know what I'm saying? When you right, you wrong, you know what I'm saying, it's up. Black love is understanding that it's bigger than you. It's about, you know, commitment, sacrifice, compromise, man. It all comes with the package. And also just come home and really love on each other and make sure that we are there for each other through the thick and the thin because it feels like \the moment I was born, my back was against the wall just because I'm a Black man. So to have a woman, \a Black woman, who understands that and is willing to dedicate her love to me unconditionally, it makes me that much more happy and honored to be that Black man in her life that makes her wanna do hjust that. - Well said. Whoo! - Whoa. - Yes. Yes. Yes. - Really beautiful. I love that. H- Wow. Very well said, Joc. Tonight, we are celebrating love. But we all have our limits where we draw the line, so let's find out what your ultimate dealbreakers are with a game we call... Now, everyone, grab your flashlights and turn 'em on like this. So we're gonna give you some hypothetical situations, and if it's not a dealbreaker, you keep the love light on, but if this is a dealbreaker, then turn it off and flame out. Got it? - Mm-hmm. - Yeah, got it. - All right. So here we go. Would you flame out if your partner was sexting \someone other than you? [upbeat hip-hop music] Boy... y'all got a hospital bill option? - [laughter] - Don't worry. - I like Kendra. Oh, yeah. - I like Kendra. She don't play no games. What if they had to watch porn before y'all did it? - I wouldn't care. - You can't be that weak. I mean, if that's what you gotta do to warm up your motor. Listen, we're all performers. As long as I get to headline. \- Ay. [laughter] - Okay. Okay. - Lights back on. - Lights back on. Last one. What if your partner wanted to have an open marriage? You could open the window. - [both laugh] - Get some fresh air. You could open the fridge. I see Joc left his light on. HWell, Kendra, how do you feel about that? 'Cause you haven't said h "I do" yet. - I'm not with that. I'm a very monogamous person. Like, if you wanna be with somebody else, take yo' ass on and be with the weak-ass, broke-ass ho, probably, you know what I'm saying? - Whoo! - Kendra! I've been there. Period. - Damn! - Don't forget dusty. The funniest part is, Joc's still got the light on. - I know. I'm like, Joc, you might need to turn that off right now. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. See, just because I left hthe light on doesn't mean that I'm the one who wants to have a open marriage. I'm showing that if my lady said she wanted to... Oh! Then maybe I could be h open too. - HThat's good. - You gotta watch for the hook. Watch for the hook. That is the greatest PR spin hl have ever heard. Okay, listen, everybody. Speaking of dealbreakers, it's time for us to take a break of our own. "We'll have more "Love & Hip Hop: "It's a Love Thing" after this. Don't just go get a wedding because it's a nice, pretty thing and it looks good. Me, I live by that [bleep]. I take that seriously. Y'all would be surprised hhow many girls send me messages daily to recreate that hotel moment. Whichever couple gets to the middle first and seals it with a kiss wins. I love licorice. When I met Jasiel, I was coming out of the gas station. So I'm walking out the gas station and I heard this little music in my head, you know? So I walk to the sound of my own beat, right? She was coming out the gas station with this little mean little look. She had on this workout gear. I was like, "Damn, she thick." "There." I pointed at her tire. She was like, "Is everything..." 'Cause I just changed this tire." I said, "Look, ma'am, I'm sorry." "I just needed something to break the ice. I took the shot." She was like, "Okay. Is there anything else you wanna say?" I was like, "Well, I'm Jasiel." She said, "Okay. Well, I'm Kendra." Two or three days later, I saw him in the bank. I happen to look over there to the right and I seen this familiar... - [laughs] - Posterior. I was like, "Damn, this is old girl from the other day!" And I was like, "What's up?" She's like, "Oh, hey." I was like, "It's one of them moments." And she was like, "Yeah, I guess it is." And I've been loving him ever since. I think we told the long version of our story. Sorry, guys. - Welcome back to "Love & Hip Hop: It's a Love Thing." Now, we're chilling with some incredible couples celebrating Black love and relationships. Now, back in season five of "Hollywood," my boy Marcus had no idea he was the guest of honor for a surprise wedding planned by Brooke. And if that sounds a little crazy, then you're absolutely right, because sometimes love requires a little crazy. - Check it out. - Wow. Hi, honey. Welcome to our wedding. What's wrong? Thought we were having dinner. - I'm dinner. - Look at the waves! Are you ready to do this? - To do what? - Get married. - [laughs] - What is this? - Mom! Come in! - Oh, my gosh. - Hey, Mommy. - What's happening here? - I don't... I'm... He said, "Hey, I don't know what's happening." Marcus, you look like you're in a little bit of trouble judging by that dress. Whoa! They stopped my face like that, huh? This is not what we had in mind. - That was funny though. - So what? - Can you come here? - What? Hell, Marc, that was funny. I don't wanna wait anymore. - [laughs] - I'm sorry. Oh, man. I don't wanna celebrate our marriage... Mm-hmm. [serious music] I'd like to celebrate our engagement. - Oh. - Oh, my gosh. - Young man. - Look how happy he made her. If you wouldn't mind, I'd love to turn this into an engagement party. Oh, my God! If it's not too much from you, would you mind being my wife? - Oh, my goodness, Marcus! - Yes. Oh, my goodness. - That's great. - Yeah, that was the bomb. - I'm sorry. - That was nice. Brooke, aren't you glad it went that way? You know, a girl's gotta do what a girl's gotta do. Feel me? I know what you need, honey. I know what you need. Y'all would be surprised how many girls send me messages daily about their attempt to recreate that hotel moment. Bless y'all. Marcus, can I say something? Talk to me, Joc. I think if I would've met you in school, you would've been my best friend, man. - We a lot alike. - Aww. Hold on, let me get some tissues. I've seen a lot of me in you, brother. I ain't gonna even lie to you, man. - For real. - Cheers, brother. I'm watching your facial expression. When they paused yo' face, you was like, "What the"... [laughter] Oh. That was a me moment, I swear, man. that you and Marcus had actually left the set of "Love & Hip Hop" one day and just went and got married. - Is that true? - Time for some of this. [laughter] There was a chapel, and we hit up all of our friends and we was like, "Yo, y'all, we about to get married." They thought it was a joke, right? And I was like, "No, this for real." They showed up and we FaceTimed my mom, FaceTimed his mom, 'cause they're out of town. We made it happen. It was great. Marriage is a beautiful thing. - Brooke, good job. And I like what you said. You said you knew what he needed. You know what I'm saying? So you was just trying to give it to him. So I wanna salute you on that. I'm all for marriage. I'm annoying when it come to marriage, man. I always encourage people to marry. Real bad annoying. We'd be in the elevator with people. He'd be like, "Are you guys married?" [laughter] "Are you gonna marry her? Are you gonna get married?" I'd be like, "Babe, stop!" Pap might be, like, a matchmaker and not know it. Each man has to take one woman and rise above the rest so she can show the world how precious she truly is, meaning if you don't take your lady hand in marriage and put her on that level, you will never know all her full potential. Yeah. When you stand there before God and you say "to honor, protect, and cherish, to hold," for rich or for poor or sick"... I don't even gotta go all the way through it. Me, I live by that [bleep]. I take that seriously. Listen, I love hearing Pap talk 'cause it always sounds like he's rhyming. ♪ Boom, take her to the fire ♪ ♪ Before I met Remy, I was a liar ♪ ♪ Ah ♪ [laughter] ♪ Wedding people, put up the steeple ♪ ♪ Papoose out ♪ [laughter] Okay, listen, everybody. Now, one thing I can say for certain, there's nothing sweeter than a kiss from the person you love, and since we're all about keeping those sparks flying tonight, this next game is actually a race called Meet Me in the Middle. Now, everybody should have some red licorice. - Aww. [laughs] And the object of this game is to start on opposite ends and quickly chew your way towards each other until you meet in the middle. I love licorice. - I love to lick her ish. - [laughs] Whichever couple gets to the middle first and seals it with a kiss wins. - Come on, baby. - Come on. Get in position. Mouths on opposite ends of the licorice. Everybody ready? In three, two, one. - Go. - Mm. Holy [bleep]! I see... damn, Tami and Reggie. They do this [bleep] all the time. - [kissing] - No, no, Joc and Kendra. Kendra... I only had, like, 2 inches. Kendra had the other... - He is lying! Kendra had the other 8. They've definitely played this before. - Yeah. So the winner is... - Joc and Kendra won. [triumphant musical flourish] I held my kiss at the end. I'm so proud of you in that. We're having a blast, but we need to take a quick break. This is "Love & Hip Hop: It's a Love Thing." I didn't wanna hold him up from all the things that he could have that I couldn't give him. And that's real. Black love is just not about the relationship between the man and the woman. It's also... it's the family as a unit. And when I say Black love, I mean Black love for our entire community. I would pop up to her crib. I wouldn't even come to hang out. What would you have when you popped up? I would have all London's favorite snack. - And cinnamon waffles. - Yeah, cinnamon waffles. I didn't really like the idea of her stopping at the gas \station with London, so I'd just go gas her car up, hand I did it. I wouldn't do it and come hang out. HI'd just be like, "I'm gonna leave this here." You wouldn't even come inside the crib. - Yeah. - Like, weirdo. - H- Yeah. - "You wanna come in?" "Nah, I'm good. Just wanted to check on you, drop this off." Yeah. You did that for about three months. Yeah, started out dropping off waffles. Ended up dropping off [bleep]. [laughs] Oh, my God. [laughs] Oh, my gosh. Hi, Mom. [laughs] - Welcome back to "Love & Hip Hop: It's a Love Thing." I'm your host, Chris, and this is my beautiful wife, Vanessa. As we saw before the break, Brooke's attempt at an ambush wedding didn't quite pan out as planned, but it did have a happy ending. We have another couple here with us tonight who had an ambush wedding h that worked in a very big way. So let's take a look at how Reggie was able to lock down his reluctant bride on their special, "Tami Ever After." [laughs] Oh, [bleep]. Reggie and I started out just fine. You know, dating, being a couple. - Let's talk proposals. How you feel about that? I don't know if that's what we should do. - That's a terrible feeling. H[laughs] The woman you love \telling you no? It's like, "Man!" I just want my family on all sides to be on one accord. The fade is tight! The bitch who can't give him hno babies, and at some point, is he going to resent me for that? - Tami is so in love. \She looks great. HOh, my God, her daughter's so beautiful. I just think that over the course of my life, a lot of men have hurt me. - God sent him for a reason. \You know what I'm saying? So allow him to heal and help you. I just wanna say, babe, I love you so much and that I'm so proud of you, what you're doing. You mean the world to me, and I can't see nobody else hbeing my woman. - [all cheering] - Oh, my God! [laughs] [overlapping chatter] - Wow. - Oh, my God. Will you marry me? [upbeat music] Ay. Yes. [cheers and applause] - The way she pulls him though! HhShoot. We about to go to Vegas. I ain't going no damn Vegas, hhReggie. Nah, it's one thing at a time. H[laughter] I already have it set up. So get your bag and let's go. Oh, man, stop! Oh, my God. Oh, my God, we are eloping. - We're getting married! - Wow. - Yes, we are. - [laughs] Tami and Reginald... Look at Mama just crying off to the side. You mean the world to me. You the light of my life. You know you made me a better man... What part of the show is this? And I love you so much for that. You've been showing me so much love and patience, and I just know that I'll spend the rest of my days on Earth hwith you. - So much love and patience. Basic! - Shut up. That's sweet. Aww. Taking this step. With this ring... both: With this ring... - I thee wed. - I thee wed. I pronounce you husband and wife. You may kiss your bride. Nah, that was sweet. [laughs] That's my baby. That was so sweet! I think I got something in my eye. Reggie, Reggie, hold on a second. You knew going in that Tami \was on the fence about getting engaged. What if she would've said no? - H- Boy. - I would've accepted that. It would've hurt. So I would've accepted that hand waited until she was comfortable... - And that's real. - To take that next step. - You know what I'm saying? - That's real. I have all the patience hin the world for this woman here. Tami, let me ask you something. One of your biggest hesitations to marry Reggie was the age difference. Was it more because you felt like you couldn't give him kids? Like, have you changed hyour mind? You know, the 17 year age difference was something to consider. I have two grown daughters. He has no children. And, you know, from that standpoint, it just felt like, I didn't wanna hold him up. HOh, my God, I'm getting emotional. You ain't never gotta worry habout that. I didn't wanna hold him up from all the things that he could have that I couldn't give him. So that's why I was hesitant \about marrying him, but... Baby, you don't have to worry about it. There's methods out here for all of that, right? - I know. - You know what I'm saying? - I know. I know. - You my queen, babe. That ain't... I grew up with both parents, man, and my dad and my mother were married until she died, and he stayed by her side until she passed, bro. And that stuck with me, man, because marriage is beautiful, man. I know y'all can hear me \getting kinda funny. But Tami changed my life, bro. This is my partner, bro, forever. Remy, you guys have gone through so much together. After not only, like, sitting in quarantine during this pandemic, \but most especially after all of this social injustice and loss that we've suffered, \like, are you relating to each other differently? This whole show, we've been \talking about Black love. Black love is just not about hthe relationship between the man and the woman. It's also... it's the family as a unit. And when I say Black love, I mean Black love for our entire community. Yo, you know, every time \we turn on the news, \it's more things happening against us. It's the moment when she's calling me and saying, "Hey, babe, I'm just checking on you. "You sounded... I saw a post you did "and you just didn't seem like yourself. Are you okay?" \- And that's one of the things. I always wanna make sure that he's good because being a Black man in America is not an easy job. \So what I try and do is, I try and always check on him. And that's the greatest, like, sign of love, Like, that is such a simple way hto show love. Ooh, child. - Yup. - Whoa. We still have more to come, so don't move. This is "Love & Hip Hop: It's a Love Thing." Both: Where's the wildest place that you've gotten busy? - Damn! - We're gonna go with... I cannot believe you told 'em! [laughter] We didn't really like each other. - I mean... - When we met. I was just vibing. You know, I'm not gonna be thirsty. I'm not, you know... now, maybe you didn't like me. Well, I like a little more... like, he's a football player, and I like a little more basketball physique. However, we sat and talked for, like, three hours, and the conversation was just so good and he was smelling so good. His shoes was on point, 'cause that's a big deal. And so I was like, "Well, hey, maybe." And, you know, the rest is history. - The D was good. - [laughs] You know, so... the D really was good, though, babe. - I appreciate it, babe. - Yeah. - I really appreciate it. - Mm-hmm. - Welcome back to "Love & Hip Hop: It's a Love Thing." We've been asking you guys all the questions tonight. Time that you start asking each other some questions to learn a little bit more about one another in a segment we called... We've come up with some great questions for you all, but here's the twist: You have to pick a couple you wanna put on the hot seat first. So you all have your little bowls. Grab 'em, pull out a question, pick a couple, and ask them a question, and you can't pick the same couple more than once. - All right, Joc. - [laughs mischievously] [laughter] I kinda wanted to ask Brooke and Marcus a question. Okay. Which "Love & Hip Hop" couple would you two swing with? Oh, my God. - Damn! - Wow. - Is this Truth or Dare? 'Cause I thought it wasn't. Can you pass? Can we pass? [both laugh] So we would have to go back in time to a couple that was together, like Erica and Cyn, and then we would swing with them. - Does that work for you? - Say that. Okay. - Okay. - If I may... [laughter] Marcus is like, "Yeah, I'll take it." - "Can I kick it?" [laughs] - Happy wife. Whatever you say. He wanted to be the bubbles in the tub. [laughter] - I just said it looked fun. - Mm-hmm. That was very gracious of you, Brooke. Yes. You offered up that moment so quickly. - Isn't she nice? - All right. Brooke and Marcus, you guys are up next. - Who do you pick? - Tami and Reg. Both: Where's the wildest place that you've gotten busy? - This a good one for y'all! - Yeah. - Man. - There's a few. But I think... [laughter] We're gonna go with our... inside of our car, which... he's 6'5"... - Mm-hmm. - And it's a Panamera. - Oh! - Oh. Oh. Were you sticking out the sunroof like Dino on "The Flintstones"? - [laughter] - Damn near. This guy is so flexible. I was so surprised how he was able to really get it. - Yeah. - That's what's up, man. - That's what's up, man. - All right, you know what? - It's our turn to ask. - Oh, my. - You pick one, babe. Here we go, Kendra and Joc. Here we go. In all of your travels together, have you guys ever joined the Mile High Club? A'ight, so I got this crazy story. - Uh-oh. - Of course you do. It wasn't the Mile High Club. But it was definitely the 1,500 Mile Club. My brother was driving a Sprinter and me and Kendra was in the back. Both: No way. Yeah, we smashed for, like, 30 minutes in the van. Nobody even knew. We was quiet. We was making love. We was... I cannot believe you told 'em about that! It was the shortest strokes. They were the shortest strokes of my sexual history. [laughter] Okay, y'all, we still have more to come, so don't move. After the break, our couples are going to give each other a happy ending. I told y'all this was date night after dark. You're watching "Love & Hip Hop: It's a Love Thing." ♪ ♪ I'm not really, like, you know, a downstairs operator. Every now and then, I'm like, "Let me just wake him up." [laughter] Kendra, finish this sentence: "Joc makes me feel good when"... Uh... [laughter] The first, first, first time where I saw him, hl, like, tried to, like, give him the eye, we was in the club, and he ignored me. He keeps saying he didn't... That's not true. - You didn't ignore me? - No, but yeah, continue. \- He keeps saying that he didn't know it was real. I couldn't believe that Remy was giving me the eye. I couldn't believe it, you know what I mean? But we started out as friends hafter that. We became really good friends. We did a song together. He was flirting with me the whole song. And we were friends for a couple of months, and then one day, we weren't friends. We were, like, inseparable, and that's how I knew she was the one for me, because whenever I wasn't with her, I always missed her, you know what I mean? I always wanted to know \what she was doing. So I was like, "Yeah, man, this is the one for me." It was cute, man. \It was cute. You know what it was? She was reeling me in. You know what I mean? She got me now. [laughs] - It worked. Right. We've been celebrating love and romance and sexiness all night, and now we wanna end it on a sweet note with a final segment called Happy Endings.

"When we're apart, the thing I miss most about Marcus is"... Is the way he spoils me because when he's gone, it's magnified how he handicaps me and does everything.
