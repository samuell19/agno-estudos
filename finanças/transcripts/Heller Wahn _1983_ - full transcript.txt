SHEER MADNESS Scenario and Direction What do you associate with rain? A queen reigns through God's grace. - Grace? - Bless this meal. Meal? Evening meal. Evening? "Star... Starling, blackbird, crush and finch..." - "...wish you... - "...a New Year's speech" - Speech? - Silence. High pitch and low pitch. Pitch? Sulfur... lava... laughter... He who laughs is not believed. - Belief? - Love. - Hope? - Death. Why not life, Ruth? Praise and blame. Blame? School, innocence, forgive us our innocence as we forgive some people. People? They're standing around me. They want something from me. What do they want? I'm supposed to make a speech, but they already know what I'll say. They have the text in their hands. What is the speech about? I won't make the speech. I think you must take it, Ruth. What's your name? What do you want? - I'm Dieter. - And I'm Olga. Do you want to see my mother? What a surprise. Bruno thought you wouldn't come this year. Alexander go and get Bruno. You did intend to come much earlier. - Is your house very full? - It's a bit like a youth hostel. The eldest "youngster" is 78. But there's room enough for you two. - You're not easy to find. - That's what's nice about it. Would you like to swim now? Not necessarily, we've just had three weeks by the see. On the Turkish coast. Since's Bruno's had his vineyard, we're only here. That's understandable. At last! Welcome! - How long can you stay? - Two or three days. Is that all? Then let's show you the place while it's still light. And you show Olga the house if she wants. - Are you together again? - Only for the holidays. What about Christof? He's abroad with friends. We bore him. Upstairs are our bedrooms and the children's rooms. Mind the two steps. Here's our living room. And what's in here? My sister-in-law, Ruth, the wife of Bruno's elder brother, Franz. This is Olga, the wife of Bruno's friend, Dieter Brandt. Now we all know who we are. May I look at your painting? Please don't, it's not finished. - Is she a painter? - No, actually she isn't. Is that just a sketch, or does it stay like that? I never work any other way. Are you colour-blind? - Have you worked like that for long? - I have done lots of them. - Don't you ever paint from life? - No. I even dream in black and white. What about you? I've never thought about it. Is it significant? I don't know. On the coast there are temples and ruins almost unknown by tourists. Some haven't been excavated yet, we clambered around them. Isn't it boring, always seeing the sea? Not at all, water is soothing, like the desert. You lose all sense of time. - I've never been in a desert. - Neither have we. We have. How many years ago was it, Ruth? Five. Were you in the Sahara? We toured Algeria, down to the Hoggar mountains in the south. Sailing under the sun makes you pleasantly lethargic. And who sailed, steered and so on? I can't sail. - And you? - Neither can I. - None of us could. We had a Turkish crew. We just idled for three weeks. Not too idle to think, I'm sure. You just sit and produce silence. You went ashore? At Vedje and Side, to see ancient sites. I prefer modern ruins. Holidays without exertion wouldn't suit me. One must be able to move. You know my need for action. Though it's not as bad as it was. I don't have that fire in my belly. Every dawn on the water must be an event. I need land, the hills here, contours. A flat surface does nothing for me. He needs to dig around in something. - I'll give you a hand tomorrow. - No, just take it easy. This wine is my own vintage, no chemicals at all. Father used to take us on such cultural tours. Not that we've retained much from them. Neither has he, lately. What use to us in later years are all the ancient churches we visited? Ruth has run off with the clothes-line. Are you sure? The washing's on the ground. Ruth's disappeared. Get the torches. Ruth's disappeared. We must help look for her. Stay here. Ruth's brother hanged himself. Franz fears she will do the same. I'll help look. You don't know the area. The torch is in the glove compartment. Every year somebody goes mad here. Now get to bed at once. Who is shouting? Tamo, go back to bed. Everything's all right. I don't want to see him any more today. Will you tell him that? Olga, have you found her? "There is an unhappy but incorrigible disparity in my soul..." "and it will and must remain so." "For I am a woman and have desires like a man, without a man's powers." "That's why I am so changeable and so unsettled." So wrote Gunderrode to Gunda Brentano. In 1801. What era was that in which such words were written? What are they about? They are about freedom and personality... in which women, too, are deeply involved. In this process they feel violently attracted to each other... and do not deny this attraction, either. Gunderrode is hard to classify in terms like classicism or romanticism... although the literary trends of the time naturally influenced her writing. Schlegel. Novalis. Brentano. Schelling. To whom we must add the women, the sisters... the friends, mistresses, wives... and for the first time they are the collaborators of their menfolk... even if some keep their collaboration secret. Bettina Brentano Sophie Mereau-Brentano Rahel Varnhagen These names stand for many others... similarly educated, similarly restless, similarly in revolt. These women manage to reflect their own situation. They advance a claim to happiness which contradicts the hierarchy's demands... which are: coldness, stiffness, etiquette and reticence. What these women demand is: directness, naturalness, intimacy, truth. But supported only by ideas and not by any accepted social standards... they are not revolutionaries, like romantics elsewhere. They are outsiders. I've often thought of you. Somehow you must have felt it. What a coincidence. How is your husband? We separated after the holidays. You're living alone now? - You're separated, too. - Yes, but I don't live alone. Mind you don't set the alarm off. You'll visit me? Would you like me to? I'm in a rented room, does that bother you? Do you think I'm that sort? How nice to see you again. Why didn't you bring Dieter with you? I've brought a bottle of red wine. No need, my brother has his own red wine, as you know... and we make more than good use of it. - The meal's almost ready. - Can I help? She'll see to it. Come and sit down. I'm really glad to see you again. - Would you like some music? - Not necessarily. An aperitif? Ruth's taken to you. Normally she's very shy of people, even shy of the telephone. She goes for days without answering it, even when I telephone her. She has no friends, no woman friend. I've tried to introduce her to wives of colleagues, but it's never worked. She has only passing acquaintances. That's why I'm so glad Ruth likes you. She speaks of you as if she's known you for ages, not just three months. A friendship with you will do her good. Besides, I'll able to see you more often. Doesn't she get on with your brother's wife? You can't make Ruth do things, the wish has to come from her. Erika was imposed on her through me, through my family. Don't mention it to her, it would hurt her. I'd be most grateful if you could reciprocate her feelings. Even at school your husband staged plays. You didn't know him then? I have the advantage of you there. I was always slightly envious of his talent. What shall we drink to? To change. It's your husband. Can you come around for a moment? I'm busy. It really won't take long. I want you to see something. All right. I'm going to see Dieter. Will you come? I'm fed up with your theatre. - Don't tell him that. - He doesn't care about my things. What things? Skip it, it doesn't bother me. I don't know why I'm doing it, but I am. How about some maths? Great idea. Why are you striding, most worthy woman, so hurriedly? ...that your ancient calves are visible up to your respectable garters? Why do you, most esteemed sir, open your mouth so wide... that the hole obscures my view? So that you, most esteemed lady, do not bump your nose on the horizon. Such a nose is like the tower of Lebanon that points towards Damascus. My love, is then the road so long? Oh, every road is long. The ticking of the death watch in our breast is slow... the blood measures its time and our life is a creeping fever. For tired feet is every road too long. And for tired eyes is every light too bright. For tired lips is every breath to hard. For tired ears is every word too much. Oh, dear Valerio... the air is no longer so bright and cold. The sky descends around me... and heavy drops are falling. Oh, this voice. Is then the road so long? I've seen her again, quite by chance. Her husband asked me to be her friend. What's your opinion? - I find her rather strange. - Then forget it. But there's something helpless about her. You've had enough of that sort. - "That sort" is you and Christof. - No. I mean your friend. Christof and I have a right to you. And Alexej hasn't? Is Ruth living in a rubbish dump? Still, to please you one has to be living on garbage. I've almost got to that stage. You wanted it that way. Her flat looks as if she didn't choose one piece of furniture herself. Don't get mixed up with her, if there's still a chance. Did Christof send me any greeting? Yes, sorry, I forgot to tell you. Professor Aschau, does humanity want peace? The general rearmament makes one doubt any desire for survival. Maybe our inability to find a policy... of peaceful understanding and international co-operation... really proves our civilization's diminishing will to survive. I wonder how our will to survive... can be so strengthened that it is transformed into resistance. Fear, generally speaking, is unhealthy. It causes insomnia, heart palpitations and shortness of breath. Many people require psychiatric treatment. But in this case our fear can in fact be a tonic. Without fear of world-wide catastrophe we'd leave everything as it is. We must not only sustain this fear, we must stir it up. This is the answer-phone of Olga Brandt and Alexej Marinov. We aren't at home at present, but you can leave a message. Please speak when you hear the signal. I'm so glad you're back. I'm sorry I'm so late, but there was quite a long discussion. The very person I need. Come and help me. See you. I've not heard from you. I'm so busy. Why did you lie to me? I wanted to see how you'd react. See your face. I must have looked pretty stupid. No, just helpless. - Have you time for a coffee? - Not really. "Peace bought with such sacrifices was too costly..." "and I could no longer stand the thought of partially destroying myself..." "in order to partially preserve myself." She always carried the dagger with her. She had a doctor show her the place under her breast to stab herself. She weighed herself with stones anyway. Do you know her grave at Winkel? No, I'd like to see it. We'll go there together some time. I must be going. Will you come with me? I'll stay here for a while. Your pose is very good. Except I can't think of anything at the same time. I have to write about my old school for the annual reunion. Do you know that today half my class are teachers? Or housewives. - Where are you? - Try to find me. Are they all still alive? Klara was killed in a car accident. Bettina died of cancer at nineteen. Renate tried to kill herself. She's in a mental home. I visit her sometimes. Will you take me next time? - Do you play the piano? - No, I'm not. Christof was supposed to learn, but he was too lazy. Alexej plays. I'm doing my Latin. This is Christof... this is Ruth. Did I disturb you? Never mind, go on playing, only maybe something less modern. - Who is Alexej? - He's my friend. - Do you love him? - Yes. Haven't you ever tried to paint something original? Yes, but I always painted it over. You'll be my first real picture. For once you're not working. Don't we know each other? What's so funny about that? Of course you know her. It's Ruth. Where's your clothes-line? Will you make some tea? I'll have to postpone the premier. You always say that. I can't get any interior movement into the play, it's all external chat. The costumes and the sets are fine, everything that isn't mine is fine. Come to another rehearsal and give me your opinion. Maybe I'll have to call it off. - Can I bring Ruth? - If she doesn't comment. She won't do that, even if you ask her. Where's your friend, then? Busy convincing someone he's talented. So he's still living off you. Not everyone succeeds as easily as you. Success fell into my lap without any merit on my part, of course. I didn't say that. If someone's really good, then he makes it. And with our culture bosses everyone has his chance. If he serves them. This is Olga. - Is anything the matter with Franz? - He sends his love. Why hasn't he come with you? He had no time and Olga wanted to meet you. Why? Because you're my mother. I don't like being stared at. I can go for a walk. No stay. But put your sunglasses back on, so I don't see your eyes. - We wanted to invite you for coffee. - Quite impossible, I'm afraid. I must help with the party here for Herr Schlesinger. What do you want to know about me? You want to pump me. Certainly not. So you know everything already. You told her I was a bad mother. On the contrary, I said you're very sweet. - Your father's opinion was different. - He had no such idea. Don't say that, he was a clever man. Just like your Franz. Are you two getting on? - You don't argue? - You know we don't. And you? I quite like arguing. Especially with my son. Why was your mother so upset? She thinks she's to blame for my brother's death. It was twelve years ago, but the word son still upsets her. I'm sorry. I should have warned you. For a long time I couldn't accept his death. When the doorbell rang I prayed: "Please let it be him." I really believed he'd be standing there. It was always someone else and I always hated them for it. Finally, I never opened the door, I let the bell ring. You're the first person to whom I like opening the door. - Franz got you out of that state? - Yes, he helped me. At first I called him "little brother". - Does he resemble your brother? - Not a bit. I know your mother's feeling of guilt, I feel like her. I feel I'm to blame for my mother's death. - Did she commit suicide? - No, but I left her to die alone. She was ill, taken to hospital and I knew nothing about it. A telegram went astray. She must have thought I'd deserted her. She refused to eat, she died. I didn't see her until she was dead. Franz is home. I didn't phone him. How many times must I tell you I'm worried? What could happen to me at mother's? I should have been told you'd gone to see her. When are you going to get over your ridiculous fear of using the phone? You fear war and I fear people. What's the difference? With your fear you wouldn't go out in the street and resist. I phoned Olga a couple of times. - Why her and not me? - She doesn't reproach me. Reproach you? I give you advice, there's a difference. You'd be in a mental home, but for me. I'm sorry. I've had a hard day. I was just disappointed that you weren't at home. You've had trouble? - Is something wrong with Ruth? - No. I'm off on a two-month lecture tour. Ruth won't come, she says it bores her. It's true, I say much the same thing. You'd find it boring, too. Would you keep an eye on her? I do already. - Shall we have lunch? - I haven't time. Maybe you could persuade her to resume her career. What is that? She was a teacher. Not for long, it's true. She just gave notice, didn't even discuss it with me, I was away. She trusts you. If I say something to her, I know she'll do the opposite. But she's not that rebellious. She has to be handled cautiously. Phone messages for you. Wipe them all. I don't want to see anyone. Not even me? If it was possible, I'd see no one else but you. You'd soon get bored with that. Let's go for a walk. I don't want to go anywhere, I'd meet people. You do get on my nerves with your self-pity. I get on everyone's nerves, most of all my own. Lot's of other people's talent has gone unrecognized. They killed themselves, or are in mental homes. Like the Gunderrode you read about. She had other reasons. Her husband... that was just an excuse. She saw she'd never succeed, not like those around her. You don't believe people can kill themselves for love? - Would you do it, if I left you? - Who knows? You'd just bring the next man into the flat. Play me something. How are you? I'm well, thanks. What have you just painted? A mountain... a high mountain. As high as the Teufelsberg? Much higher. Like the Zugspitze? Or Mount Blanc? Like the Himalayas? A black or a white mountain? A black mountain. - On its own? - Yes. Nice hair. Your hair is nice, too. - Olga has nice hair, too. - Yes, I think so, too. Wait. I'll be right back. Have a nice weekend. Her delusion is that she must preach from a high mountain, but no one listens. She's run off several times to find that mountain. Now she just paints it. Perhaps that's an improvement. What does she preach? On the seventeenth day of the second month... the spring of the deep will burst forth, the windows of heaven will open... and there'll be rain for forty days and forty nights. The promised flood. Franz talks like that, but not in such a Biblical fashion. For you. Lovely. You know... The idea of a moody wife... who spends all day in galleries, takes lone walks... he calls it my foolish isolation, he likes it, he needs it. I don't believe it. That would mean he'd like to see you unhappy. He thinks his picture of me tallies with my secret wishes. Do you understand? No. Besides, I'm sure it's not like that. Has he spoken to you about it? Of course not, but I've got eyes on my head, too. Not only you. Did you furnish the flat? His mother did. Don't you like it? Not particularly. Every one is a copy. Yes, but her talent lies in the selection, in the arrangement. She succeeds in an entirely new perspective, a new interpretation. Doesn't she paint anything original? No. There are painters who transform others' material. There are painters who are photographers. Look at him. He also works in black and white only. And what does your friend do? She just takes away the colour, that's all. - You could help her a lot. - Do you know what an exhibition costs? You get on my nerves with your women. - What are you, then? - A business woman. - You weren't money-conscious once. - I didn't have a gallery once. You haven't told me what school camp was like. Fine. Just too short. Is that all? Thomas has a girlfriend now. - And what about you? - Not so good. I'm not interesting enough. Maybe you're too demanding. Yes, they should be well-informed about rearmament. - Telephone. - Answer it. It'll be for you, anyway. At first she wouldn't let me in, she wanted to hide her pictures. But you know me if I want something. - Why have you never shown them to me? - I don't think they're good. I can risk an exhibition with her pictures. I'm glad you insisted, Olga. We must celebrate. Pity I didn't bring any champagne. I'll get some. There certainly won't be a crush. Nobody knows her. Do you remember that evening in Provence? When she meets strangers, she always runs away. She might do the same this time. I can't imagine that. I won?t criticizing you, I'm very grateful to you for doing this for her. She told me she's pleased. Have you never noticed that she lies? We should let her decide. When I met Ruth she was certain that her dead brother haunted her at night. I had to go through a real exorcism with her. What's that to do with the exhibition? Her brother painted, too. And he killed himself after his first minor success. You think she could do likewise? Certain people are unbalanced by too much affection from others. What rubbish. Suppose she can't take it. Do you want to risk that? I have to tell you something, darling, that may disappoint you. The gallery can't put on your show now. They have organizational problems, but there may be a chance next year. - I must tell Olga. - She knows already. She asked me to tell you. Let's think it over calmly. Think it over! My pictures are no good. It has nothing to do with the quality of your pictures... only with Frau Sander's lack of organizing ability. Maybe we should insist, after all, she gave you a firm undertaking. I don't want to force myself on anyone. Come here, my love. She only wants to postpone the show, and in a year you'll progress, too. If you're very unhappy, we can talk to Frau Sander again. But I don't want to. Your mother says... at her age she can't adapt herself to a man. Can you put in a word for me? I'd like to marry her. I'll try. She's a wonderful woman. I keep thinking about that tiresome person. Do you mean Olga? How she stared at me from behind her glasses. Unpleasant eyes and an unpleasant aura. I warn you, don't mixed up with her. You know I have a feeling about people and I'm seldom mistaken. Then why did you marry father? Stop running down Olga. Let's talk about Schlesinger, why refuse his proposal? Oh, he's an old good-for-nothing. He fits better to you than father. You can't possibly judge, you hardly knew your father, you were too small. - Your father was more clever. - What did his cleverness do for you? You're right there. These are my friends, all musicians. We studied together in Moscow. Umberto. He plays the violin. Sasko plays the flute. Ivan, my best friend, he plays the viola. And I'm Alexej. Eat with us. Panos has cooked good Balkan food for us. - Where is Christof? - I don't know. We've decided to form a group. We'll play everything. New music, old music, dance music... Do you mind if we practice here? Only when you're at the university. When you have to work, we'll keep quiet. Once I almost did the same as you, I was a teacher. Why did you give it up? Every morning I was afraid. Do you know why? When I woke up I had this pressure in my neck... and when I reached school I had the feeling someone was strangling me. In the classroom often I couldn't speak, not even to say good morning. Did you feel the pupils treated you badly? I just feared that I had to be there and couldn't tell them what they needed. I couldn't shake off the feeling that I couldn't teach them anything at all. - You're doing marvelously. - I couldn't, if you weren't here. How about our Ruth? She looks very lovely. Lots of people have said that tonight. - Can I get you a drink? - I still have one. You look very lovely yourself. I'd prefer to play in a concert hall. - Stop if you've had enough. - No, I'm enjoying it. My heartiest congratulations. Thank you. Your husband's play is such a magnificent success. Make a request. Will you still love me tomorrow? It's time. Stay beside me now, will you? I'm sure he's going to make a speech. I'd like to get out of here. You can't now. I'd like to be alone with you. To wish ourselves a happy new year? Why not? You hid in a corner with Olga all evening. That's not true. And I thought you liked Olga. In any case, you see her every day. You were the loveliest woman there. I thought Olga was the loveliest. I'm surprised you've so much to talk about, considering you meet every day. Why do you have so much to talk about? You've neglected me recently. We're friends, you wanted us to be. But I'm still here, too. Oh, Franz, of course you are. I'll read an extract from Bettina's account of Gunderrode's suicide. It makes it clear that she not only mourned her friend... but she was also hurt. "It hurts me and I reproach her, as I used to in my dreams..." "for leaving the beautiful world." "She has treated me badly, run away, when I wanted to share all delights." "She was so timid..." "a young nun who was afraid to say grace aloud." "She told me she was afraid when it was her turn." "She didn't want to say the blessing aloud in front of others." Ruth Aschau, please read on. It would be best if you came and stood here. I only wanted to listen. But this isn't a lecture, it's a seminar. Excuse me! That was stupid of me. No, you were right, I should have been able to do it. - You wanted to help me. - Nonsense. I just wanted to show off. What does she do for you that I don't? She gives me her time. I hope you don't reproach me for earning money. I reproach myself for not earning. Is it my fault you never see anything through, you give up half-way? If I hadn't come along, you'd still be in your mother's parlour. Now you hang around at Olga's. If you want to resume your career, you have my full support. I can't, I realized it again today. Maybe Olga will think of something. Olga... you sound like a parrot. You have me to thank if she spends so much time with you. You think everything is heaven-sent. Nothing comes that way, even friends must be cultivated. You mean you got Olga to... Yes, I begged her to look after you, to give you some attention. Why did she do that to me? It's her brother haunting her. Her brother. You wouldn't do such a thing? - Swear it. - I swear it. I'm so thirsty. I'll get you something. - You've sworn it. - Yes, Christof. Please, don't let her die. Go away, please. I'm not going until I know what's the matter. Did you take money, too? Money? For what? You and Franz made an arrangement. He said that? He said you only visited me because he asked you. He forced our friendship on you. How can that be? I can't be forced into being your friend. Anyway, you'd soon have noticed that. When I really want something, I'll believe anything. So many flowers. All flowers of joy. Just lie down. I'll cook, afterwards I have a surprise for you. Olga knows about it already. Greater Cairo has a population of twelve million. By 2000 it will be 16.9 million. How can you be so precise? They'll have to seal off the city, even now it's difficult to feed it. Surprisingly, suicide is rare, the country for suicide is Germany. Ruth and I don't want to hold an ordinary seminar or a lecture. You've written your questions and anyone is free to answer them. You all speak German and you've studied the subject. Well, do you agree that we all try to do it like that? Then Ruth and I don't have to pretend we know more than you. Marie von Ebner-Eschenbach: why regard her as a women's movement writer? Any ideas? Yes please. She helped it, but not in a direct, modern way. She once said it's best for women to remain silent. Their actions, not protests, should establish that women have talents. Women are not gifted. It wasn't until she was fifty-five that she achieved success. She writes in her diary: "In our country a new natural history book has made the discovery..." "that a woman by herself is nothing." "She can only become someone..." "through the man to whom she submits, through whose life she is fulfilled." "Such an imperfect being cannot possess any perfect talent." She realized quite clearly that her difficulties in writing success... were linked to her being a woman. Their knowledge amazes me, our students couldn't cope with much of it. They've prepared well and they have good teachers. Despite their amazing talents, the girls are steeped in Islamic tradition. - Ask them. - Ask yourself. Ruth is very keen to visit a fortune-teller. Do you know any? Yes, I do. I've been to one. That's news to me. How long have you been superstitious? Our maid took me with her. Was the prediction correct? Some of it. It's nonsense. Our work obliges us to adapt to a country, but... I don't understand you. Why didn't you tell me about it? - I don't tell you certain things. - Why not? Because you'd just get upset. Thanks to your visit, I'll learn something. Will you take me? We're emancipated European women. You must drink all of it. The tomb of the twins. Could we add another two days? Have you been in the desert? I'd like to see Bruno and Erika. We could drive there from Marseilles, I'll let Franz know by telegram. Better than calling. What a detour! We might as well stay here. It's very important to me. Please. Is it something the fortune-teller said? - How long were you with Dieter? - Fourteen years. 14? We're getting old. Sometimes I think I'll... then everything starts to happen. What starts to happen? Franz is here. I haven't told you, it's supposed to be a surprise. - Aren't you tired? - I'd like to lie down for a while. - Franz, why are you here? - I couldn't stand being without you. - You dropped work and came here? - Of course, when it's important. - Now tell me everything. - I want to lie down for an hour. Franz, thank you so much for the trip. I'd have liked to come with you. It won't be a good vintage year, if we don't get some sun soon... It was so warm in Cairo. Wasn't it dangerous? Two women alone and unveiled. - We weren't often alone. - That sounds exciting. We met lots of people. - What sort of people? - Mainly women. What about the pyramids? We saw them, too. And the mummies? We wanted to see them... but the light's affecting them. They wanted to replace them in the darkness of their tombs. We took lots of photos. I'll go and fetch them. They're in our case. I've rarely seen Ruth so active. It really was a wonderful trip. It's so enjoyable listening to you. We even conducted a joint seminar. I'd like to show you a Romanesque church near here. Franz has to go home. We could go back a day after him. Olga, I do so like traveling with you. - Will you some with us, Erika? - With pleasure. We've an early start, so we'll get some sleep now. I want to see a church tomorrow with Olga and Erika. I can't stay any longer. Take tomorrow's plane and I'll follow later with Olga. - I'm to go alone? - I'll take you to the airport. Do you mind if we stay on? Not at all, I'd be pleased. - Erika, keep out of this. - But we've lots of room. No, Ruth is coming with me. I'll bring her back safely. - Besides, Ruth's not a bad driver. - Only when I'm with Franz. - Of course, I oppress you. - Stop it, Franz. - Keep out of it, Erika. - I want no more rows here. It's none of your business, especially yours. Yes, you rule here. Your vineyard, your garden, your brother, your children. But for cooking... I'm suddenly a member of the family again. - I work in the fields. - Yes, you find it an enjoyable change. Erika, please stop. At least no one can take your painting from you. She gave it up, under this lady's influence. And they call themselves friends. Who prevented Ruth from having her exhibition? You or I? Weren't there organization problems? He even paid expenses to prevent it. Shut up, or I'll kill you. Everything was agreed. I knew you'd be a success, but he claimed success would destroy you. I explained why. Because you can't bear competition. Don't talk such nonsense. Your concern for her is only concern for yourself. You've no idea, you don't know her at all. She might become better than you. Franz is right. Ruth has systematically alienated Ruth from him. I'm sick of your supercilious, affected, intellectual sensitivity. Karoline von Gunderrode! As if only women had a soul. Keep away from my wife. Christof. Is Alexej awake yet? He's gone, mummy. Gone away forever. - Did he say why? - He said you smother him. But that's not true. You mean he'll never come back? It can't be true. I'll be back in a couple of hours. I need you. I need you, too. "Kindly pay by return... the bill for removing the piano." I wanted to ask you pardon. I was in such a senseless rage that evening. - Are you still angry with me? - No. - You're really not? - No. Ruth hasn't said a word to me since. She's quite right, I behaved very badly to you. Couldn't you talk to her, tell her we've patched it up? Please, Olga. I don't know what else to do. During the flight I kept trying to explain to her, but she's like a stone. Don't make her suffer for what I did to you. Every year someone goes crazy and someone is the victim. This time it was you. I did many things wrong. I may have had wrong image of you two. I promise nothing like this will happen again. I love Ruth. I feared losing her. You were quite right in what you said. Please, Olga, you've always helped me. No, there's no point. Darling, all in the dark? Frau Aschau, you have stubbornly kept silent about these events. I give you a last chance to speak before the Prosecutor's final speech. I'd like to thank Olga for having helped me to kill him. Olga Brandt? My friend. Transcribed by mitbrille Karagarga@2014
