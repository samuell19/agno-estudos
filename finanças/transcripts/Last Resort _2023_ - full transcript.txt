(man speaking in foreign language) We had a plan. What the fuck did you do, man? (man speaking in foreign language) (body thuds) (car tires screech) (solemn music) (driver speaking in foreign language) (tense music) (playful music) Oh, shit! Michael, I told you to fix the bath two months ago. And now I'm thinking, I have to talk to your father. By the way, there's list in the kitchen, if you ever do decide to get off the couch. I wasn't deciding to do that anytime soon anyways. You know what? You should get the remote control transplant into your hand. It's not even possible. (sighs) Just because you are in a mission break, it doesn't mean you shouldn't do something at home, Michael. What? (Kim sighs) Come on, Anna, let's go get your stuff. Dad, will you come with us? No, not today, pumpkin. Right, so I'll tack the bank by my own then. Honey, Daddy love his couch too much. He too busy watching his cartoon. I wonder who's 11 years old in this house? Daddy is very tired, okay? And Mommy's got... Mommy's got Daddy lots of work to do, so just off with it. Oh, some reading, then. Bye, Dad, I love you. Love you. Oops. My lucky pen. (tense solemn music) (dog whines) What did you do in my shoes? (soft suspenseful music) (bell tinging) [Anna] Mom, why is Dad sleeping on the couch? Because he snore like a bear. A nice bear, right? Yeah. He used to be a nice bear. [Anna] And why doesn't he ever come shopping with us? He doesn't love us anymore? Daddy loved you, he loved you very much, and he always will. What about you? Sometimes parents move away from each other and they don't understand each other anymore. Times tears them apart. That's life. I don't like the time that tears you and Dad apart.

We gotta catch up. (Michael exhales sharply) (indistinct reporting on TV) We have breaking news. Since 9:30 this morning, the Savings Bank has been a scene of a hostage situation. Shots have been heard inside the bank. A lot of customers are being held inside by an armed group. As you can see behind me, the authorities have deployed a security perimeter for them around the bank, and a SWAT team is beginning to deploy. (phone button clicking) (phone humming) (soft solemn music) (tense music) (tools clanking) (dramatic suspenseful music) (car tires screeching) - More! - Oh. All right, which one is your office?

You don't belong here. Leave it to the pro. Officer Deepan, number 612, is that right? All right, calm down, calm down, or, or I take you in. You have a .38 holster with a Colt .45, your shoelace is untied and you have slight arthritis in your left hip. If you're a pro, Officer Deepan, then, then I'm a bullish dancer. (Watana speaking in foreign language) (Deepan speaking in foreign language) (Michael clears throat) - Sir. - Sir. You saw all that in 20 seconds? In five. I-I think my family's inside. You think, or you sure? The car is out front and, uh, they would, they had an appointment here earlier, and their not answering the phone. Okay, I understand your concern, but I just want you to know, the situation is under control, it's just a matter of minutes. You've made contact? Contact? Not yet. I had a look at your tactical report, and your men are too close, there's no fire support, and there's absolutely no cover on the far side. Sir, it's not "Call of Duty" here, please... Stay outside the line, leave it to us, and above all, don't try anything stupid, it's too dangerous. Promise me that you don't move, okay? Yes, sir. Thank you. (Watana speaking in foreign language) Please. (soft tense music) Your shoelace is untied. Thank you. (Deepan groans) (phone ringing) Hello? I wanna talk to the man in charge. (officer speaking in foreign language) (soft suspenseful music) This is Lieutenant Watana, I'm in charge of the situation. What should I call you? Number One. What do you want? Can you hear me? - Yes. - What do you want? Nothing yet. (soft tense music) (suspenseful music) Right, listen up, everybody. We're gonna gather up all of our guests, and we're gonna bring them in to the meeting room, right here. Let's go! Let's go!

(solemn music) (suspenseful music) (phone ringing) Lieutenant Watana. Hey, lieutenant, listen up, I will not repeat myself. I want you to release our comrade, Sadar Boline. He's being held at Klong Prem Prison. You have two hours, after that, I kill a hostage every 10 minutes. No, no, that's not enough, I need more time. You have to give me more time. You have two hours. Time is a luxury we can't afford, lieutenant. Wait. If you have injured people, please, let them out. (tense music) No injuries, but their lives are in your hands. (suspenseful music) Wait. (Phone line beeping) (suspenseful music continues) (Watana speaking in foreign language) [Officer] Yes, sir.

I'd like to talk to Sergeant Deepan from district one, registration number 612. [Dispatcher] Just a moment. He's in the field. I have some information about the bank robbery. [Dispatcher]Okay, I'll connect you. Argh! (phone ringing) Did you send your fucking men? Did you? Negative. You have my word. No one's moved. Did you execute any hostages? If you move as much one millimeter, I will kill every hostage and I will blow up this whole fucking building! No one will move, you have my word on that. Son of a bitch. (tense solemn music) (Watana speaking in foreign language) (Deepan speaking in foreign language) (hostages whimpering) (Kim speaking in foreign language) (Anna speaking in foreign language) (terrorist speaking in foreign language) Sh, sh. Sh. (solemn music) (phone humming) Hello? Listen, buddy, we don't have a lot of time. Remember me? I'm the guy who was looking for his family. What do you want? I'm inside the bank, and I gotta say, it's kinda hot in here, and there's guy's with guns everywhere and explosive vests. Tell your boss not to move, and if you need to contact me, you can contact me on this number. Are you crazy? What the hell are you doing there? Just do as I say, and I'll be in touch. (solemn music) (Deepan speaking in foreign language) Number Three, report. God damn it, English. Yes, yes. Number Two, report. Yes. Yes. Observer, report. (radio crackling) Observer, report.

They broke his neck. Yeah. Listen, how long before we're into the vault, we gotta kick ass, everything's changed. (soft solemn music continues) All right, listen up. I make it one man. He's between the last of the bodies, most likely, and the lobby, all right? So we're gonna sweep each tier. You two, you go down to the fifth floor and you wait, nothing gets by you to the top, you wait, I will send you backup. We will get another team, we will come up from the lobby, and we'll meet in the middle. We're gonna find this son of a bitch and we're gonna neutralize him. All right? All right, let's go.

Out. (hostages whimpering) (Cooper sighs) (solemn music) (hostages whimpering) [Michael] Hello? Lieutenant Watana speaking. [Michael] Lieutenant. What the hell are you doing? Did you shoot? [Michael] Instead of yelling at me, you could be thanking me. I clean up your mess. Hey, we didn't ask you to do anything. Get out of here and let us handle this. No way, I'm coming for my wife and kid. I assume you are the professional? Sort of. Can you tell me more? Well, we got a gang of highly trained, very well armed robbers. (soft tense music) I'm listening. This is unfortunate, but they seem to be from the Middle East. They're highly equipped with, uh, explosive vests. I dunno why the hell they're here, but they look more like terrorists. This match my intel. There's hardly any money in the bank. Plus, they ask us to release a prisoner. We don't know where he is. What are you gonna do? Keep negotiating. What about you? Get my family back.

Y-yes, I know what I have to do, I'm a man of honor, are you? Yes. Yes. Allah 'akbar. Yes. Fucking baboons. (phone ringing) (suspenseful music) (phone beeps) I'm kinda busy right now. Are we a team or not? I'm listening. They're not after the money. And? And, we have a serious problem. A certain about Abu Omar came to drop off the briefcase a few days ago. You need to find out where he is, and find out what's in that briefcase. There in lies the problem. He die after a car accident two days ago. We need to fuck up their plans. One more thing. You were right about Hamza's wish. Sometimes it sucks to be right. Hey, take care, man. I got work to do. (tense solemn music) (terrorist speaking in foreign language) Okay, stay where you are and hide, let him come on, and we shoot on sight, no hand-to-hand.

You're not taking me seriously. (gun fires) (Watana speaking in foreign language) (tense music) [Cooper] We have a fucking problem. How's it going in the vault? It's going. [Cooper] Now get it on. Things have changed up here. Okay. (phone ringing) Hello? Soldier, I'm under a lot of pressure here, I'm not gonna be able to hold out much longer. The closer I get to the hostages the more terrorists are left. If you storm in, they'll kill all the hostages. What do you suggest? Don't let them get out. I'll do the rest. Okay. (Guns firing) (suspenseful music) (guns firing) (guns firing) (solemn music) (terrorist screams) (gun firing) (knife whooshing and thudding) (guns firing) (knife thudding) (solemn music continues) [Terrorist] You, go, go.

(soft solemn music) (soft solemn music continues) Gimme the phone. Okay, boss, we got the case, it appears to be safe. Yes, yes, I will bring it to you with Ibrahim, just as we agreed. I'm gonna do my part, please do yours. Just one little question. What is it? Why this fucking bank? The carrier felt like he was in danger, and he had to react. He hid the briefcase the first bank he found. (chuckles) Yeah, well it was really fucking stupid, it's a 24 nightmare. All right, Number One to all units, all units listen up. We are out of here ASAP. We have the case, it is safe. Please, hostage team, rally the hostages, they are our best protection. Priority one: We get the gas out safe and sound.

(Laughing) You really gonna kill thousands of innocent people? (Cooper laughing) I don't give a fuck what they do with that poison gas. Don't they have a right to pick their enemies just like you and me, huh? They paid me a lotta money to get it back, a lot. And I'm gonna do it. (soft tense music) Dad, did you come looking for us? [Michael] Yes, sweetheart. - Oh my God. - Well, this is all so touching, but, uh, who's gonna die first? No. They had nothing to do with this. That's right. That's exactly right, but, oh, what did you call me? O-oh, a mutt. (Chuckles) He called me a mutt. I'm a mutt. (Chuckling) Remember when I told you never to do with my equipment? - Do it. - I don't know what to do. [Terrorist] Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Princess! (Kim shrieking) (explosion thunders) (curious music) Kim. Kim, could you, could you get that knife and untie me. (curious music continues) Quickly. Michael! (Sobbing) (dramatic music) Are you all right? - Yeah, yeah. - You all right? You all right? (Kim whimpering and sobbing) Okay, okay. Did you do all this? Never let me hear you say I never done nothin' for you. What are you doing? (Michael groans) (gun snaps) We need to keep moving. Okay, okay, okay. (Whimpering) Argh, this way. (tense music) (phone ringing) Michael, is it you? How do you want to proceed? I'm gonna take them up to the roof and lower them down with the ropes. Can your sniper cover me? Michael, get out of there, just let it go. It's just something I have to do. I asked the special force to step in. That's give us less than 30 minutes. That's the best I can do. All right, gentlemen, we're gonna outta here soon, all of us. Ibrahim! Top priority, you get that case ready to travel with the gas, all right? Mosa, you're gonna rig your explosives to blow a hole big enough for us to get through in this north wall, got it? Now, when we get out, the vehicles are 100 yards from here. Watch for snipers, engage only if engaged, you got it? Now, last, but just as important. Masud, you're gonna take your men up to the first floor, the second floor, the third floor, you gotta sweep every floor until you find Mr. Michael Reed and his lovely family, and you're gonna neutralize 'em, okay? And you're gonna cover our ass on your way out. Go! [Masud] Right, go! (soft tense music) (Anna panting) Dad, I'm tired. Anna, now is not the time. (Anna panting) Jump on my back. (soft tense music continues) (Michael grunting) (Kim panting) Kim, move up! Hold on to Dad. (Kim and Michael panting) Sorry. (Kim panting) Sorry about that. Are you all right? I'm okay. - You all right? - Yeah. I know you guys still love each other. (soft tense music) Come on, let's go upstairs, like Dad says. Okay. Okay. Soldier, what is your status? (soft tense music) Your men are in position? Just like you said, but it's risky. Life is risky. (soft tense music continues) (terrorist speaking in foreign language) (tense solemn music) (tense music) Put the harnesses on. [Kim] What do you want to do? [Michael] I'm gonna lower you down the side of the building. [Kim] But, Michael, it's impossible. Just trust me on this. I don't know how to do much, but this I know how to do. I'm, I'm sending you something precious, so just be careful. [Watana] Okay, soldier. [Michael] Okay, just do it. (soft tense music) Don't be afraid. I'm not afraid, it's like "Dora the Explorer". Here, Dad, it's my lucky pen, take it with you for protection. Michael, I never gonna make it. Stop complaining. (soft tense music continues) Be careful. (tense suspenseful music) Oh my God. Oh my God. (Breathing heavily) Oh my God! Hey, I never signed the papers. You're not well. (Kim screaming) (tense solemn music) (tense music) (Watana speaking in foreign language) (tense music continues) (air whooshing) (rifle snapping) (scope dial clicking) (tense music continues) (rope creaking) (Michael strains) (Kim whimpering and screaming) (suspenseful music) (guns firing) [Terrorist] Go! (guns firing) (suspenseful music continues) (Michael groans) (Kim screaming) (rifle fires) (bullet thuds) (Michael strains) (Kim screaming) (guns firing) (suspenseful music continues) (terrorist groans) (rifle snaps) (bullets whizzing and clanking) (gun snaps) (tense music) (knife rasps) (terrorist screaming) (blows thudding) (terrorist grunting) (rope whirring) (Kim screaming) (foot thuds) (terrorist grunts) (Kim screaming) (rope creaking) (tense music) (Michael straining) (tense music continues) (rope creaking) Lieutenant, how much further? [Watana] 20 meter, Michael. You're almost there. (tense music continues) (rope creaking) (soft tense music) How long will it take? Twenty minutes. Come on. (tense music) (Michael straining) (suspenseful music) (Kim whimpering) (suspenseful music continues) Okay, soldier, we got your family back. (soft music) (moves to suspenseful music) I spoke to a friend of ours, we need to stop them, they're spreading their shit all over the city. They blow up the north wall, and they're trying to escape. [Watana] What do you suggest? (Michael strains) (metal plate clanking) You take care of the north wall, I'll cover things from here. (suspenseful music continues) You understand I can't leave without saying goodbye? [Watana] Copy that. (suspenseful music) Masud! Masud! (Masud speaking in foreign language) English, please. - Yes, in English. - Son of a bitch! [Michael] No reception. Oh my God. Fuck these idiots. (tense solemn music) (suspenseful music) (explosion thunders) (guns firing) Mosa, calm down, just tell me what's going on! (guns firing) (solemn music) Fuck! Fuck! (hostages whimpering) (phone ringing) Hey, lieutenant. Ah, touché, huh? You got some good men. All right, I tell you what, you meet me at the front gate, and I got something for you. All right, we're going Plan B. Plan B, these three right here, out in front. Go, go! (terrorist shouting) (hostages screaming) Shut up! Shut up! (solemn music continues) (guns firing) (tense music) (door humming) (tense solemn music) [Watana] Stop! Lieutenant! Unless you want me to shoot pigeons, pull your men back. I wanna a helicopter on the roof now! You pull another stunt like that, I'm gonna pour lethal gas off the roof of this building. (gun fires) (woman yelps) (shouting in foreign language) (tense solemn music continues) (Watana breathing heavily) Listen to me. Listen to me! I don't give a shit. You wait or you're gonna get each other killed! - Just put... - Wait a second. That was not the plan. I must have the gas for another mission, and you must protect me, secure the briefcase, and bring me back to the meeting point. Look, I'm gonna handle it. Leave me alone, all right? (Ibrahim speaking in foreign language) Oh Jesus. (Ibrahim speaking in foreign language) You really trying to me off! Get outta my way! (tense solemn music) (Watana speaking in foreign language) (officer speaking in foreign language) We got a chopper on the roof in eight minutes, block it with whatever you got, mine it, and that should hold 'em. We'll see you on the roof, I need help with hostages. Go, go! (Michael panting) Lieutenant, are you there? I'm still here for you, soldier. Is my wife there? She's right next to me. (officer speaking in foreign language) (Deepan speaking in foreign language) (Watana speaking in foreign language) (Anna speaking in foreign language) (soft tense music) Hey, I'm here, honey. I wanna apologize for what I put you and the kid through. I'm just a piece of shit. Listen, Michael, (sobs) I'm the one who should be apologizing. I didn't know what you were doing when you were resting. (Sobbing) You should have told me, I would have understood. Kim, I live in a world full of horror and nightmares. (dramatic music) I can't put you through this. I can't put you through this. Give us a chance to help you. (Michael sobbing) Michael, take care of yourself, (sobs) Anna I need you. Anna I need you. (dramatic music continues) (Kim sobbing) I need you, Michael. Dad, please come back. (Kim sobbing) (dramatic music continues) (Michael sobbing) I, I can promise you that. (Kim sobbing) (dramatic music continues) Can you put, can you put Watana on the phone. (Kim sobbing) (dramatic music continues) (Kim speaking in foreign language) Go ahead, soldier. Ugh, they're going back up to the roof with the hostages. The chief asked me for helicopter. I agreed. I don't want them to killing anymore hostages, but I can't let him get away with the gas. He threatened to release it if I did not agree with his term. The situation is really complicated, soldier. I prepared a surprise for them. Copy that. (suspenseful music) Restless and complicated. Have one of your team come up from the back and take 'em from the front, but let me lead the way. [Watana] Okay? All right, now we're going to the roof! I want everybody to stand up! Stand up! (tense suspenseful music) Now, I... It's the boss. Uh, fuck. (tense music) What are you looking at? (gun fires) (hostages screaming) (tense music) Yeah, yeah. What's going on? Where is the tank, and Ibrahim? We have a contract, don't forget. Yeah, well listen, I'm a little bit busy right now. I want to talk Ibrahim! We had some circumstances, we're working it out. Goodbye. All right, let's go! Go! Let's go! (gun firing) (hostages screaming) Go! (tense music) (hostages screaming) (tense music continues) (chopper engine roaring) (tense music continues) (hostages whimpering) (terrorist shouting indistinctly) (helicopter engine roaring) Take 'em over there. Masud! Go get him! (body thuds) (smoke canisters clanking) (hostages screaming) Hey! Come on, let's go! Get the hostages! (hostages screaming) (guns firing) (bullets clanking) (rifle firing) (terrorist groans) (bullets thudding) (rifle snapping) (guns firing) (bullets clanking) (Michael thuds and groans) (tense music) (helicopter engine roaring) (Watana speaking in foreign language) (helicopter engine roaring) (tense music) (Cooper laughing) Now, you thought you were the best, and I fucked you. (gun clinking) Two shots to the heart, as usual. (gun fires) (Cooper groaning) (Cooper screaming) (gun fires) (Cooper grunting) (gun fries) (blows thudding) (tense music) Close. (knife rasps) (metal plate clanking) (laughing) You and your toys. Crude, but effective. Clever, this shit. You did well against my passionate baboons. (tense music continues) (helicopter engine roaring) You should join me. You can make a million doing this. (Michael chuckles) Come on, brother. You're not my brother. (tense music continues) (Cooper shouting) (knives whooshing) (Cooper laughing) Good. (both groaning and grunting) (knives whooshing) (blows thudding) (suspenseful music) (both straining) (suspenseful music continues) (head thuds) (Cooper groans) (Cooper thuds) (Cooper grunting) (knife whooshing) (fist thuds) (knives whooshing) (blows thudding) (both groaning) (tense music) (suspenseful music) (blows thudding) (Cooper screaming) (blows thudding) (knife clanks) (Cooper growls) (blows thudding) (knives whooshing) (both groaning and straining) (knives thudding) (both groaning) (Cooper screaming) (blows thudding) (suspenseful music continues) (knives whooshing) (both groaning) (Cooper screaming) (Cooper grunts) (blows thudding) (knife clanks) (blows thudding) (both straining and grunting) (blows thudding) (suspenseful music continues) (Cooper growling and grunting) Argh! That's it! It's over! (suspenseful music continues) (soft tense music) That's it. (Cooper grunting) (tense music) (tense music rising) (suspenseful music) (helicopter engine roaring) Hey! (suspenseful music continues) Dad, will you come with us? Love you. Oops, my lucky pen. Michael! (Sobbing) Here, Dad, it's my lucky pen, take it with you for protection. (dramatic suspenseful music) (pen thudding) (Cooper grunting) (pen thuds) (Cooper gurgles) (pen thuds) (Coper groans) (tense music) (soft music) (helicopter engine roaring) (phone ringing) Well done, soldier. Houston, we have a problem. (suspenseful music) You didn't find a canister, did you? Nothing. We searched everywhere, we did not find anything. How many dead bodies did you find? Wait. (suspenseful music continues) Four dead hostages and 47 terrorists. One is missing. What do you mean? Did you count them? [Michael] I need to keep track. How do you think I'm still alive? (suspenseful music continues) What's going on? (suspenseful music continues) He must have escaped with the hostages. Holy shit, Michael, did you see him? Lieutenant, I'm doing what I can. (Watana speaking in foreign language) (officer speaking in foreign language) Michael. (suspenseful music continues) Michael. Got it. He's escaping north. Look, if this guy decide to put a gas in the city, we are fucking dead, Michael, you understand? Lieutenant, I know. (suspenseful music) Come on, move. (suspenseful music continues) Shit, I lost him. (dramatic suspenseful music) Allah 'akbar! (dramatic suspenseful music continues) (gun fires) (bullet whizzing and thuds) (tense music) (soft tense music) (gentle music) (gentle exalted music) (gentle exalted music continues) (gentle exalted music continues) (gentle exalted music rising) You do know we're gonna have to change banks now. It's on you. Thank you, lieutenant, I will tell him. Bye. Dad, Dad, come, come, come sit here! Come, come! Why do you get it so bossy? (Kim chuckles) How'd you get so bossy? - Come sit. - Did you teach her - to be bossy like that, or what? - No, you crazy. - Just sit. - And you're watching this crappy cartoons. (Kim giggles) Come on then, merry Christmas. Hey, lieutenant Watana just told me that there will be no persecution against you! That's great. That's great news. Let's watch cartoon, okay? Uh, yeah. (playful music) (tense music) (tense solemn music) (tense solemn music continues) (dramatic suspenseful music) (dramatic suspenseful music continues) (dramatic suspenseful music continues) (dramatic suspenseful music continues) (tense solemn music) (tense music) (chanting) (dramatic suspenseful music) (dramatic suspenseful music continues) (dramatic suspenseful music continues)
