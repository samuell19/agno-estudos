Brought him back from town with me. He used to work at the Griffin Bank. Well, that ought to be useful. Yeah. Helped me do a layout of the town. Mm-hmm. Well. Is this the bank?Uh-huh. Sheriff's office on down the street.Over here, huh? Uh-huh.Uh-huh. Does this alley go all the way out of town? Yeah. Well, you did a good job, Ira. I feel like I live there. After we hit that bank, they'll be glad you don't, Sam. - Sam Ward? - Mm-hmm. Uh, do we need him anymore?Uh-uh. I, uh-- I'll be goin' then. All right, boys. Get your horses. Oh, uh, Ira, did you find the, uh, Keliher place? Yeah. It's up at the head of Clear Creek. Oh, seven, eight hour ride maybe. You're sure that Keliher's there? Yeah, he's there, all right.Good. I'll just pay him a little social visit when the job's finished. Meet you back at the hideout, huh? Oh, Sam.Yeah? How long you gonna be?Just long enough to kill Logan Keliher. Logan. Yes? - Have you seen Sammy? - He's helping me. I think. All right. Here. Let me give you a hand. You seem awfully anxious to help. We're going to town, aren't we? Who said anything about we? It's a long trip. I could help you drive. Yeah? Well, did you talk to your mother about it? She-- She doesn't really care. But she did say you couldn't go. Did she say why? She thought I'd be a bother to you. But I won't be. I promise I won't. Well, I tell you what. You've, uh-- You've been a big help to me getting ready and everything. Maybe I'll just have a little talk with your mother. Thanks, Dad. Susan, you know, I don't know if I'm up to making this long drive all by myself or not, and... Sammy's offered to go. Yes, we discussed it before. He'd be a lot of help. I thought you'd have enough to worry about. Hmm, town's such a treat for a little kid. Even Griffin, after living out here all this time. Looks like I'm outvoted. All right, Sammy. Put your jacket on. We'll be back sometime tomorrow. Hope you don't mind both your men being gone overnight. Somebody has to hold down the fort. I hope everything goes all right in town. We don't want to move again, do we, Sammy? Don't worry. We won't. What about the money? How can you raise--I'll manage. Come on, Dad. Let's go. Told you he'd be a lot of help. Now you be a good boy. Let's go. Come on. Whoa. Like to do something for me?Yes, sir? You take this list over to Fishman's store and ask him to fill it. You wait for me there.All right, Dad. Sammy.Yes, sir? - Would you like to have a licorice stick? - Sure would! Tell me Mr. Fishman I said it'd be all right. Sorry, mister. Farmer's in town. It's not even Saturday night. I'm looking for Goldie.Oh. She's upstairs. Oh, hello, Keliher. Ain't seen you in town in some time. Hello, Diggs. Well, now that you're here, maybe you'd like to have a drink with me. Are you buying?Oh. Well, no. Well, I was kind of hoping you would. I'm sorry, old-timer. I'm afraid farming hasn't been much more profitable than buffalo hunting. Them two bumming each other for drinks, it's a good way for both of 'em to stay sober, eh, Pink? Come on, farmer. I'll buy you a drink. Barkeep! Set 'em up. There you are, Diggs.. You can have mine. I'm not too proud. Jeff said he wanted to buy youa drink. I didn't refuse him.Then drink it. Pull in your horns, Pink. Logan's drinking with me. You will join me? Well, as long as you saved my hide, Goldie. Pink doesn't know you as well as I do. Joe. He's the best gunhand in Griffin, so I hire him. It doesn't mean I like him. Kind of a pushy kid with him. Jeff? When Pink's cold, Jeff sneezes. He'll learn better, if he lives long enough. You've been mighty scarce since you moved here to Griffin. Farm keeps a man busy. Farming. Somehow that just doesn't seem your style. You've changed a lot since the old days down on the border. Look different without that .45 strapped to you. I have to admit I miss it now and then. Got everybody around here fooled. Remember the last time we had a drink together? Del Rio. You were with the Texas Rangers then. I thought you'd come in to shut me down. No, no. I had other fish to fry that night. Another one? This is not exactly a social call, Goldie. I'm flat broke. Oh? I owe the bank $500 on that place of mine. That's a lot of money, Logan. I know that. That's why I came to you. Well, I don't carry that much money with me. It wouldn't-- Goldie, just tell me. Yes or no? You wouldn't say it, would you? Say what? I haven't forgotten, Logan. You did me a good turn once, but you'd never mention it when you're in trouble. I expect to get this back. I expect you will. You're too late, mister. The bank's closed. I know they're closed, but they're still in there. We're closed! Come back tomorrow. I told ya. Them bankers sure got it soft, ain't they? Most of us have got to work till dark. Idiot.Somebody looked in the window. - All right. Get goin'. - Sheriff! Sheriff Moore! Let them draw 'em off. They're robbin' the bank! Help! They're robbin' the bank! Sam. Who wants to ride in the posse?[ Chattering ] Hyah. Logan? Logan, is that you? Sam. Where is he? He's not here. Well. Let me take a good look at you, Susan, girl. It's been a long time, hasn't it? You haven't changed a bit. You look even better than ever. - You're wounded. - Oh, it's nothing. Don't worry about it. Let me bandage it for you. Well, all right. You always were a good nurse, Susan. A good wife too, for that matter. Our boy, uh-- Our son-- he's with Logan? Yes.Mmm. Six years. I guess he's not a baby anymore, is he? No, he's a big boy now.[ Chuckles ] I was hopin' to see him. Sam, he doesn't know you're his father. Well, he will, soon enough. Try to understand, Sam. Everything's different now. Nothing's different, Susan. Not with me. So Logan left you all alone, huh? Well, he, uh-- He ought to know better than that. A beautiful woman like you shouldn't be all by herself like that. It's not safe. I mean, that's how I lost you, remember? You can't really believe that. Well, it's true, isn't it? A little sweet talk from Logan when my back was turned, and, well, you just got a little mixed up, honey. Sam, you went away to prison-- for life. You knew they weren't gonna keep me there. Couple years and I'd had enough. Came out looking for my wife. Sam, I'm not your wife. You knew about the divorce. Well, now, we won't worry about that. Look. I understand, honey. This-This thing with Logan was just a-- well, a handy way out... for you while I was gone. Logan had nothing to do with it.[ Sighs ] Sam, our marriage was through when you first started making your way with a gun. Logan took you when I was behind bars. When I couldn't fight for you. Well, I'm out now, and I'm taking you back. It's finished between us. Is it, Susan? Let's see if it is. Well, Logan's-- Logan's got a stronger hold on you than I figured. Too bad we don't have more time. There'll never be time. Not for us. You'll come around, Susan, when Logan's dead. I'll be back. You can count on that, honey. - He was here. - Yes. We drove all night. I'll put him to bed. He came here to kill you. Somehow I never really believed he'd try. He said he'd be back. We've got to move, Logan. We've got to go someplace where he'll never find us. No use running. Besides, I just paid the bank. We can't stay here now. He's coming back to kill you... and to take Sammy. He found us here. He'll find us anywhere. Best chance is to see he's caught and sent back to prison. Can't they get him without you? Who knows him as well as I do? I was praying you'd never have to use that gun again. I know. I hope you don't have to kill him. That's the last thing I want to do. Logan. Don't take any chances. I don't want you to kill him, but if it has to be you or him-- if it comes to that-- I want you to come back. Oh, I want you to come back. You fellas shoot, then ask questions later, huh? We was certain you was Ward. Well, I'm sorry to disappoint you. Say, I've had enough of this anyway. Let's head back for town. What's the matter, Leach? Beginning to wish you were back at the saloon, throwing out drunks? You better lay off. You must be part of Sheriff Moore's handpicked posse. Yeah, we are, but what are you doing out here all alone? Where's the rest of the posse, Tucker? We lost the trail. The sheriff split us up into bunches to cut sign. This tracking's supposed to be your long suit, isn't it, Diggs? I've tracked a sight of 'em, but this fella Ward is might tricky. Did you know it was Sam Ward we was after? Yeah, I knew. I'd like to come up against him. Maybe you'll get a chance. Keliher, you never did say what you was doing way out here. I was trailing Sam Ward. - That ain't Ward's horse. - Nope. I'm ridin' Ward's horse. He stole mine. Funny thing he just happened to stop by your place. It isn't funny to me. That's a good way to get a bullet in you, Lottie. Something went wrong. Well, not altogether. What happened to the others? They won't be back. My man, Ira-- What about him? He got killed in the getaway. I want his share of that money. You sure do come right to the point, don't you, baby, huh? Well? How about it? About what?About the money. I want Ira's share. It's mine now. Well, you might be selling out too cheap, Lottie, girl. Oh? You got something else in mind? Ah, maybe. Just how much did you get? Enough for you and me... to blow the town of El Paso wide open. El Paso? El Paso. Yeah, I think I'd like that just fine. Won't take me any time to get ready. No, no, no. Hold on. Hold on there. Let's, uh-- Let's spend a couple of days gettin' acquainted, hmm? Yeah, you're not a bad looking woman, Lottie. Doll you up a little bit there, why, you could hold your own with most any company. Oh, I bet you know how to spend money, Sam. Well, now, I'll tell ya. I never been able to save any. You know somethin'? Ira told me I was gonna like you when he talked me into comin' up here. Mm-hmm?Mm-hmm. Was he right?Mm-hmm. Well, you didn't grieve very long, did ya?[ Chuckles ] About as long as he would have grieved for me. Yeah, I like that. You know, a man will always know where he stands with you, Lottie. Whoa. Couldn't trail a herd of buffaloes through this kind of goin'. You think there's any point in lookin' further? As long as we've gone this far. I say we're wastin' our time. Let's turn back. How about you and Jeff, Pink? Well, town would look pretty good to me right about now. Me too. I've had a bellyful of this ridin' blind. I'm afraid I'll have to agree. We might as well call it quits. Diggs, you know this country real well, don't ya? Better than most. All right. Let's say you're an outlaw on the run. Where's the one place you wouldn't go from here? Right up there. - Why not? - 'Cause nothing there but rocks and rattlesnakes. Unless maybe you want to count them murderin' Apaches. They hole up back in there after a raid. Sounds like just the kind of a place Ward would pick. That'd be just a wild goose chase. Then why don't you go back? 'Cause you're too anxious. Think I'll just string along, just in case. I wish they had gone back. If they'd have left, there'd have been fewer of us to split the money. Let's worry about the reward after we catch him. I wasn't thinkin' about the reward. I think I'll wear my hair piled high. Mm-hmm. Maybe an ostrich plume. And a red satin dress. Oh, yeah. I look good in red. Do you like red, Sam, hmm? Hmm?Hmm? Sam.Yeah. Oh, you'll be proud of me. Red satin, hair up and silk. Nothing but silk next to my body. Oh, I love the feel of silk.Yeah, so do I. - Hold it, Sam. Ah, you took me by surprise, Logan. I didn't have that much luck when I came lookin' for you. About the unluckiest thing you ever did. Oh! Now stay over there. It's all right, Lottie. It's me he wants. I'll make a deal with you, Logan. You're not exactly in a position to make a deal.Give me my gun. We'll settle this between us right here and now. - No. - You owe me that much. I don't owe you anything, Sam. Give me my gun! Look. One of us will walk out of here, and that'll be the end of it. Uh-uh. That'd be easy for you. You don't have anything to lose. I do. Turn around. Lean your head against the wall. Let's see 'em. What about me? For now you might stir up a pot of coffee. Look. I didn't do anything. I was just waiting here for them to come back. - Now that's no crime. - We'll let the law decide that. Watch that arm. I took a slug in it. I know. I put it there.You were in Griffin? I wish I had seen you. I saw you plain enough, after my first bullet dropped ya. Now sit down. Why didn't you shoot me again? Ah, you felt guilty. Sure. You felt guilty about stealing my wife and kid. No. We were friends once, Sam. It's not easy to shoot an old friend. Friends. That's a long way back, Logan, and I've got one big advantage over you. You won't kill me unless you have to. I won't hesitate one second about killing you. So you got him all by yourself.Good going, Keliher. A man can't have no privacy anywhere. Hey, Pink. Look what we got here. Turn around, honey. Let's have a look at ya. I said turn around. Ah. Say, you're a looker, huh? You can keep my share of the reward, fellas. I'll take this instead. Take your hands off of me! Leave her alone. - What's it to you? - I said leave her alone. You giving the orders from now on, Keliher? I'm giving the orders. How come? After all, he took Ward. Yeah, that's right. He did. All right, Jeff. Leave her alone. Did you find the money? I didn't even look for it. Figured I have plenty of help. Well, you found Ward easy enough. I'll make him tell where it is. You'llmake me tell? You won't get it out of him like that. I'll bet she knows where it's hid. - No. - She knows, all right. Just give me a minute with her. What's the matter with you fellas anyway, talking about torturing people? The money can't be that hard to find. Well, it ain't back there. Maybe he hid it outside. Let's start looking for it then. Hey, old-timer. Come here. You better protect your interest, huh? They're sure anxious about that bank money. Yeah. Too anxious. I'm sure glad you're along, Tucker. I'll do what I can. Have you got enough to feed this bunch? Well, start fixing. I have to get wood. Go ahead. You're wasting time, Sam. Oh, I'm in no hurry. My chances are looking better by the minute. I'd say your chances are mighty slim, unless you say where that money is. You want them to beat it out of you? I'm not worried, Logan. As long as I got you here to protect me... from those honest citizens. No! No! N-- It's in the fireplace. The fireplace! I said I could make her talk. Leach. I see you found it.Uh, he almost got away. How much did you get?I don't know yet. Come on. We'll give you a hand with it. I was hoping that fight out there would have lasted a little longer. So I noticed.That's a sweet bunch you got there. I didn't pick them.Well, maybe you should have, boy. More than 20,000! I don't think I've ever seen that much in one pile before. This would buy a high old time back in Griffin. Boys. Boys. There's no reason you shouldn't keep that money. Why, sure. Let me go, and nobody back in Griffin ever need know that you found me or the money. That's kind of an interesting thought. Yeah, it's worth considerin', all right. There's only one thing wrong with it. We can't trust you. Now if you were dead, we'd be home free. We could tell them back in Griffin that we had to kill Ward... and that we couldn't find the money. What about her? She'd tell the whole thing. We'll get rid of her too. Hold on. Killin' Ward's one thing. I ain't for murderin' no woman. You don't have to do it. I'll take care of it. I killed many a squaw Indian fightin'. 'Tain't no different. That money's going back to Griffin. These two are going with it. I don't think you can stop us. We've got Diggs. Now Jeff here is a little squeamish. But when it comes right down to it, he'll back me. You might have Tucker on your side. Of course I stand behind Keliher. That's cold-blooded murder you're talkin' about. Well, I kind of figured you'd see it that way. Leach, I don't imagine you're quite so high-minded. I sure ain't. You like the odds? We got callers. Apaches. Most likely scouts for a raiding party. We make a mighty tempting target down here. You shoot and there'll be a war party down here in no time. We can't just wait till they hit. Afraid you're right. They'd turn this place into a graveyard. I think we better just act like we don't know they're out there. Till after dark, then try to slip away. Do you think he's right about that Apache war party? When you go, leave me here. I'd as soon take my chances with those Apaches as with this bunch. Not a very good bet either way, Sam. Tie my hands in front here, will you? I can ride a lot better. Yeah, and you can grab a gun a lot better too, couldn't you? Why, Logan, you know me better than that. I'll take my own horse back. Well, I thought it was a fair trade. I didn't. Leach, give him a hand. Stick with me. I'll look out for you. Over against that ledge. Quick. Come on, giddyap! What did you see?Nothing. The best thing you could've seen. They're probably hittin' the cabin about now. I wouldn't have given a plugged nickel for our chances last night. How much you think they'll be worth after them Indians find out they've been tricked? I'm plumb wore out. When're you figurin' on stoppin'? Well, not here.That girl needs some rest. Those Apaches catch up with us, she'll get a good long rest. This will have to do. That, uh, Keliher, he, uh, sure pushes hard, doesn't he? Yeah. Too hard. You want me to help you find a place to bed down?No, thanks. I'll, uh-- All right. All right, Sam. Bail off. You better post a lookout. I know them Apaches. They ain't give up. I'll take the first watch. Whoever's on guard keeps an eye on Ward. You and Ward seem uncommon friendly. In case you get any ideas, remember, I sleep lighter than a night owl. Stay awake all night if you want to. Tie these horses off. No, no, no. Not now. Later. I'll come to you. You got a strange sense of humor, Sam. But then you always did have. No, no. I was just remembering that night on the Concho... when we were in the Rangers together-- You remember that night? Yeah, I remember it.[ Chuckles ] Yeah, it was Comanche country. Just the two of us on guard that night. All those shadows out there. Yeah, we were a little edgy. Oh, Captain Roberts he-he said, uh-- he said, uh, "The Comanches never, never strike at night." Remember? Yeah! Yeah, well, just when we were getting a little comfort from that thought, those Comanches hit us. Boy, they came hollerin' and yellin' in out of the night. Scared us half to death. Yeah, we had quite a fight on our hands that night. Oh, Logan, Logan. In those days, I thought more of you than anybody in the whole world. I would have put my life in your hands. Matter of fact, I did. Well, it just goes to show you how wrong you can be about people. First time I get in a little trouble, first time I get on the wrong side of the law, you turn against me. Well, I haven't trusted anybody since. I didn't turn on you, Sam. I even quit the Rangers so I wouldn't have to go after you. You quit the Rangers so you could go after my wife and kid. That's not true. Sam, you left that girl broke and homeless with a baby to raise. Well, that don't give you no license to go out, uh, uh, stealin' 'em. We didn't even think about gettin' married at first. I... felt a responsibility because you were my friend. A responsibility I don't think you ever felt. Logan, everything that I ever did I did for them and their sake. Shootin' a man and goin' to prison for life... is not exactly the right way to raise a family. Well, I didn't mean to shoot that man. I mean, not the first one anyway. And then, after I-I broke out, well, I had no choice but to go on makin' it with my gun. You didn't have to come looking for me. Oh, yes, I did, Logan. That's the one thing I did have to do. There's something you better get straight, Sam. Susan's my wife now, and I love her. And Sammy's my son, not yours. Mm-hmm.He was only a baby when you left. All these years, he's had my love and I've had his. It's not enough just to plant the seed, Sam. The real father is the man who gives his whole life to a child. I'm the father. Sammy's my flesh and he's my blood. And I'm gonna kill you for takin' him away from me. No, no, not here. Over there where they can't see us. Come on. Hyah! Hyah! Giddyap! All right, let's get ready to ride. Now Ward jumpin' you like that kinda sets my mind at ease about a couple of things. Well, now you know. Is this yours? You tricked me, you dirty little--No, I didn't! Let me got! Oh! You were supposed to be guarding him. Stop crowdin' me or I'll make you wish you-- Turned west here. He's headin' right back the way he came. Not anymore. Hi, boys! You must be gettin' to like that horse of mine, Sam. Nice of you to bring him back this time. Yeah, well, I figured you'd appreciate that. Brought back a mess of Apaches to boot. Thought you preferred those Indians to us. No, I changed my mind. There's a place to stand 'em off up ahead. Hyah! The rifle, Sam. What's the matter, boy? Don't you like the way I shoot Apaches? Yeah. You shoot Apaches fine. We did it! We whipped 'em! You don't know much about Indians, do ya?Think they'll be back? They'll be back, all right. It's just a matter of when and how. Keep an eye on him. Why don't we try and get out of here while we got the chance? Yeah, sure. Those Apaches would like that just fine. I'll take my chances right here. Everything all right back here? Yeah, I guess so. Are they gone?For now. Look, I can use a gun if I have to. We may need you. Do we have much chance? We'll give 'em a fight. I guess you're safe enough here. Logan. I'm sorry about the knife. That was last night. No. I didn't know Sam was gonna try to kill you. You don't know Sam very well, do you? I do now. He's just like all other men. Using me. He sure made it sound good, though. Promised he'd take me to El Paso, dress me in silk, stay at the best hotel. Oh, yeah, we had a lot of fine plans. Now, if I even get out of this alive, probably wind up going to prison. Maybe not. No one needs to know about that knife. Thanks, Logan. You know, I've always thought that all men were the same. But if I get out of this alive and get another chance, I--[ Gunshot ] Diggs, stay there! Watch that ledge. I'll try to draw him out. Lottie. I-I feel, uh-- I feel sort of naked without my gun. It won't take long to dress you when those Apaches hit. You know, Logan, I get the feelin' that you don't trust me. Should I? We ought to get outta here while we still got the time. Well, we ought to! We won't stand a chance in here when they come back! How much of a chance you think we'll stand out there? Leach gettin' a little edgy? Man ought to learn to face death without whimperin'. Maybe it's the waitin' that's gettin' to him. Well, that's the hard part, all right. But when they do come, then a man's really alive. Diggs, you know, I get the feeling you kinda like this. 'Tain't that so much. But life sort of passed us by. Now fightin' Indians, well, that makes us of some use again. It's good to know that old gun's on my side. Well, you're not a bad fella, Keliher. The way they come nowadays, anyway. Just a mite of education... would straighten you right out. Nobody's gun is ever on anybody's side out of plain kindness of heart. A man's nature is too pure cursed for that. I can't give you an argument about that just now. The way I see it, everybody's out after everybody else's hide, one way or another. Who are you lookin' to skin out, Diggs? Nobody... unless he stands in my way. Sort of what I figured. Tucker. Now, about that bank money. Hey, Diggs, I'm glad you brought that up. You know, it's funny. I'd all most forgotten about the money. You know, you didn't have quite the right attitude... when we talked about it back at the cabin. But then, your objection's been taken care of. Tucker, of course, he was against killing Ward. He won't care now. Hey, Leach. You haven't changed your mind, have you? No. That's it, then. We'll shoot Ward and split the money. Let's see. There's five of us left. Comes to $4,000 apiece. Aren't you hurryin' things a little bit? Keliher hasn't agreed to come in with us. Oh, he'll come along with it, won't you, Keliher? There's four of us against you. You're damned if you do and damned if you don't. All right. $4,000 looks pretty big to me right now. But we better hang onto Ward for a while longer. Came in handy this morning. Oh, we'll leave him here with them. He'd just be dead weight for us. Not if we run into those Apaches again. He's right. We'll keep Ward until we get out of Indian country. So now the Indians are savin' my life, huh? In front. All right, get down. Without the rifle. Carrying the two of us, this horse will never make it in to Griffin. Griffin? We'd be better off if we headed in the opposite direction. With that old fox Diggs on our trail, it doesn't matter which direction we hit. If we make it to Griffin, we'll be safe. Safe, huh? Well, that don't exactly fit into my plans. You know, Logan, you're such a good friend, aren't you, that you're gonna save me for a hangin', hmm? You made your own bed, Sam. Well, what are you gonna do? Lynch me? Nope. Unless you try to get away. I'm gonna let you lynch yourself. Now move out. Go on! Hold up, Sam. You ought to be played out enough by now. The rope's sawin' my head off. Turn around. Well, it looks like we're on the same side again. First things first, for both of us. We'll never be able to stand them off here. Work higher. Sam? I was gonna kill ya. You make up your mind to do something, you sure are bullheaded. How bad is it? Probably live to get another chance at me. I'll get the horse. Leave me here! No. You'll be takin' a corpse back. You can make it as far as my place. I'll fix up the wagon and take you in from there. Talk about bein' bullheaded. Logan. I've got Sam out there. He's alive?Just barely. I didn't shoot him. Dad! Dad! Boy. Come here. Come on, boy. Sam might tell him. Let me take a look at you, son. You don't know me, do you, son? Are you the man Dad was after, Sam Ward? My name is Sam too. I know. Is it true you killed 20 men? A kid in town said so. How many, then? Too many. You bad hurt, mister? Yeah, I'm bad hurt, all right? Could I help ya? Could you get me some water? Sure. Thank you, Sam. Dad! Dad! He's hurt, Dad. Yeah, I know. Fix a bed in the wagon. Sammy, you help your mother. You ready to travel? Come on.I'll do it. Ohh! You're-- You're doin' a good job, Logan, with my-- uh... with your son. Yeah. With our son.
