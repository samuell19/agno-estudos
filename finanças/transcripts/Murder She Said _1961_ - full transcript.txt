P.A. system: STATION ANNOUNCEMENT. THE TRAIN STANDING AT PLATFORM 2 FOR EALING BROADWAY, HANWELL, HAYES, WEST DRAYTON, LANGLEY, TOUGHLOW, MILCHESTER, AND BRACKHAMPTON. [WHISTLE BLOWS] [LOUD CLATTERING] [WHISTLE BLOWS] [WHISTLE BLOWING] TICKETS, PLEASE. A WOMAN HAS BEEN STRANGLED. I SAW IT. I BEG YOUR PARDON? A MAN STRANGLED A WOMAN IN A TRAIN. I SAW IT OUT THERE. STRANGLED? YES, STRANGLED! YOU MUST DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT AT ONCE. ME? WELL... MADAM, DON'T YOU THINK PERHAPS YOU HAD A LITTLE NAP AND MAYBE HAD A BAD DREAM? YOUNG MAN, I WAS NOT DREAMING. I SAW IT. WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO ABOUT IT? WELL, UH...LOOK, WE'LL--WE'LL BE IN BRACKHAMPTON IN ABOUT 5 MINUTES. I'LL REPORT IT SOON AS WE GET THERE. THANK YOU. COULD I--COULD I HAVE YOUR NAME AND ADDRESS, MADAM? YES, OF COURSE. MISS JANE MARPLE. M-MARPLE. MARPLE. OLD PASTURE LANE... PASTURE LANE... MILCHESTER. MILCHESTER. I SEE. VERY WELL, MISS MARPLE. I'LL REPORT THIS TO THE STATIONMASTER SOON AS WE GET THERE. YES, PLEASE DO. THANK YOU. A BAD DREAM, INDEED! [BELL RINGING] [KNOCK ON DOOR] ALL RIGHT, LUCY. I'LL ANSWER THAT. MORNING, MADAM. I-- NOT TODAY, THANK YOU. INSPECTOR CRADDOCK, COUNTY C.I.D., MADAM. OH, I AM SO SORRY. DO COME IN, INSPECTOR. I'VE JUST BEEN GOING THROUGH ALL THE PAPERS AGAIN FOR THE LAST 2 DAYS. THERE'S STILL NOT A WORD ABOUT THE MURDER. I SUPPOSE THE POLICE ASKED THE PRESS TO SAY NOTHING FOR THE MOMENT. DO SIT DOWN, WON'T YOU? LULL THE MURDERER INTO A FALSE SENSE OF SECURITY, THEN POUNCE, EH? OH! WHAT'S THAT? OH, HOW STUPID OF ME. HERE, SIR. I'M SO SORRY. LUCY! YOU WILL HAVE SOME TEA, WON'T YOU? OH, UH... SOME TEA FOR THE INSPECTOR, DEAR, PLEASE. YES, MA'AM. WELL, NOW, HAVE YOU GOT HIM? WELL, I, UH... THAT IS, WE HAVE COME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT WHAT YOU SAW ON THE TRAIN WAS, UH...WELL... A MAN AND A WOMAN... YES, AS I SAID. I MEAN, UH... PERHAPS THEY WERE HONEYMOONERS. INSPECTOR, I MAY BE WHAT IS TERMED A SPINSTER, BUT I DO KNOW THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN HORSEPLAY AND MURDER. OF COURSE, MADAM-- UH, MISS MARPLE. BUT THE FACT REMAINS THAT THERE'S BEEN A THOROUGH SEARCH OF EVERY TRAIN, AND NO HOSPITAL HAS TREATED ANY WOMAN SUCH AS YOU DESCRIBED. SHE WAS BLONDE AND HAD ON A COAT WITH A PALE FUR COLLAR. AND NO SUCH WOMAN HAS BEEN SEEN GETTING ON OR OFF A TRAIN EITHER ALONE OR WITH ANYBODY ELSE. WELL, OF COURSE NOT! SHE WAS DEAD. FURTHER, A COMPLETE SEARCH HAS BEEN MADE OF EVERY INCH OF THE TRACKS FOR THE WHOLE LENGTH OF THE LINE. NEGATIVE. OH. SO YOU DON'T BELIEVE ME. I DIDN'T MEAN TO IMPLY THAT. YOU CERTAINLY DID. NOT AT ALL. I, UH-- WHAT, THEN? I--AHH. I ASSURE YOU, MISS MARPLE, THAT A WOMAN CANNOT BE MURDERED ON A BUSY TRAIN A FEW MINUTES BEFORE A STATION WITHOUT OUR FINDING OUT ABOUT IT. I'M QUITE SURE YOU MEAN WELL, INSPECTOR, BUT IF YOU IMAGINE THAT I AM GOING TO SIT BACK AND LET EVERYBODY REGARD ME AS A DOTTY OLD MAID, YOU ARE VERY MUCH MISTAKEN. GOOD DAY. I'M SORRY, MRS. STAINTON. THE HATRACK HANGING, FALCON-SMITH'S LATEST-- I'M AFRAID WE HAVEN'T RECEIVED OUR COPY YET. PLAIN INEFFICIENCY. ANYWAY, I WANT TO KNOW THE MOMENT IT COMES IN. OF COURSE. OF COURSE, MRS. STAINTON. OH, GOOD MORNING, MISS MARPLE. GOOD MORNING, MR. STRINGER. GOOD MORNING, HILDA. [WHISPERING] One moment. The Hatrack Hanging. I've been keeping it for you. MR. STRINGER, WOULD YOU SAY I WAS AN UNSTABLE WOMAN? OH, CERTAINLY NOT. IN FULL POSSESSION OF MY FACULTIES? ABSOLUTELY. AND NOT GIVEN TO HALLUCINATIONS? MY, NO. THANK YOU, MR. STRINGER. THE POLICE THINK I'M DOTTY. WHAT? APPARENTLY WHAT I SAW WAS A YOUNG MAN AND WOMAN IN THE THROES OF CONNUBIAL BLISS. I SEE. WELL, IF I WERE YOU, MISS MARPLE, I WOULD CERTAINLY WRITE TO THE CHIEF CONSTABLE. MR. STRINGER, HOW MANY DETECTIVE NOVELS WOULD YOU SAY WE HAVE READ OVER THE YEARS? IMPOSSIBLE TO SAY. CERTAINLY MANY HUNDRED. YES. WHICH GIVES US, WOULDN'T YOU AGREE, A CERTAIN KNOWLEDGE OF THE CRIMINAL MIND? OH, MOST ASSUREDLY. WELL, THIS IS WHERE WE PUT THAT KNOWLEDGE TO THE TEST. WE? YES--WE. SO IT HAS COME IN! OH, HAS IT? WELL? I THINK I HAVE FIRST CALL. I DON'T THINK YOU'LL LIKE IT, HILDA. TOO OBVIOUS. THE MOTHER DID IT, OF COURSE. HOW CAN YOU POSSIBLY KNOW THAT? THE BOOK HAS ONLY JUST COME IN. IT ALWAYS IS WITH FALCON-SMITH-- A DEPRIVED CHILD, YOU KNOW. HOT BUTTERED CRUMPETS FOR TEA, MR. STRINGER, IF YOU CARE TO JOIN ME. INDEED I WOULD, MISS MARPLE. AH, YES. HERE WE ARE. EXPRESS TO BRACKHAMPTON OVERTOOK MY TRAIN SOMEWHERE ABOUT THERE. BUT HOW CAN YOU BE SURE? WELL, I REMEMBER THE TICKET COLLECTOR SAYING 5 MINUTES TO BRACKHAMPTON. COULDN'T HAVE BEEN MORE THAN A MINUTE AFTER THE MURDER HE CAME IN, SO THAT MAKES IT 6 MINUTES BEFORE BRACKHAMPTON AT, SAY, 30 MILES AN HOUR. SO... ABOUT THERE. BUT THE BODY, MISS MARPLE. WELL, IT SEEMS CLEAR THAT WAS THROWN FROM THE TRAIN BETWEEN HERE AND BRACKHAMPTON. THE POLICE FOUND NOTHING. OF COURSE NOT. THE MURDERER RETURNED BEFORE THE SEARCH AND DISPOSED OF THE BODY. BY JOVE! THE POLICE WILL CERTAINLY WANT TO INVESTIGATE NOW. WELL, ACCORDING TO THEM, THERE IS NOTHING TO INVESTIGATE. OH, SURELY, IN THE LIGHT OF OUR THEORY, A FRESH SEARCH-- DEFINITELY. BUT THIS TIME, WE WILL CONDUCT OUR OWN. EH? YES, MR. STRINGER. I RECOMMEND A HEARTY BREAKFAST TOMORROW. YOU AND I ARE GOING TO TAKE AN EARLY-MORNING WALK. THERE MUST BE SOMETHING SOMEWHERE. YOU CAN'T THROW A BODY OUT OF A FAST-MOVING TRAIN WITHOUT LEAVING SOME KIND OF TRACE. MISS MARPLE, IF WE LINGER HERE MUCH LONGER, I FEEL CERTAIN WE SHALL BE APPREHENDED. OH, NONSENSE. NO ONE WILL GIVE A COUPLE OF TRACKLAYERS A SECOND GLANCE. I'M NOT ALTOGETHER CONVINCED OUR DISGUISES ARE ADEQUATE. A SHOE, A BIT OF CLOTH. SOMETHING! I CONCEDE OUR TIMETABLE MAY HAVE BEEN OUT-OF-DATE, IS STILL RUNNING. VERY POSSIBLY. BUT IT COULD BE MOST DANGEROUS UP HERE! UNDOUBTEDLY. [TRAIN WHISTLE BLOWS IN DISTANCE] MISS MARPLE! MISS MARPLE! HERE. THERE YOU ARE! I THINK I HEARD SOMETHING. AND I THINK I'VE FOUND SOMETHING. REALLY? [TRAIN WHEELS CLATTERING] CONSISTENT WITH SOMETHING HAVING BEEN DUMPED FROM A TRAIN, WOULDN'T YOU SAY? IF IT WAS THE BODY, IT WOULD ROLL DOWN AND FINISH UP AGAINST THIS WALL. THEN WHERE IS IT? THAT, MR. STRINGER, IS THE QUESTION. COULD BE BURIED. YOU WOULD NEED A PICK OR A SHOVEL. NO. THIS IS HARDLY AN IDEAL SPOT FOR DISPOSING OF A BODY. UNLESS... FROM HER FUR COLLAR, I THINK. MR. STRINGER, WILL YOU KINDLY GIVE ME A LEG UP? CERTAINLY, MISS MARPLE, I-- PLEASE, MR. STRINGER. NO, NO! MAKE A STIRRUP. COME ON, NOW. CAREFUL. ARE YOU READY? YES. INTERLOCK YOUR FINGERS! THEY ARE INTERLOCKED. OH. WELL, ARE YOU READY? YEAH. OH! MAGNIFICENT. DOWN. WHAT A FRIGHTFUL-LOOKING MAN! WHAT A FRIGHTFUL-LOOKING DOG. MISS MARPLE, PRUDENCE DEMANDS A RETREAT. MR. STRINGER, I AM CONVINCED THE BODY IS THE OTHER SIDE OF THIS WALL. BUT THAT'S THE ACKENTHORPE HALL ESTATE. I KNOW. PERFECT. EASY ENOUGH FOR SOMEONE TO COME DOWN OUT OF THE HOUSE, RECOVER THE BODY, AND DISPOSE OF IT SOMEWHERE IN THE GROUNDS. SOMEONE FROM THE HOUSE? YOU MEAN, ONE OF THE FAMILY? YES, OR ONE OF THE SERVANTS, IF THEY'RE LUCKY ENOUGH TO HAVE ANY. SERVANTS. I WONDER. MISS MARPLE, WHATEVER IT IS, NO, NO, NO! MR. STRINGER, WE WILL WITHDRAW... TEMPORARILY. GOOD MORNING. GOOD MORNING. I'M AFRAID THERE'S NOTHING ON MY BOOKS, MADAM-- NOT SO MUCH AS A MOTHER'S HELP. I'M SEEKING A POST, NOT OFFERING ONE. PRAY, BE SEATED, DO, MY GOOD WOMAN. YOU NEED SEEK NO MORE. YOU'VE COME TO THE RIGHT PLACE. HOW GOOD TO SEE THE SPIRIT OF UNSELFISH SERVICE IS STILL WITH US. LET ME SEE NOW. YES. HERE'S A PERFECT PLUM. "CHEERFUL HOME FOR CHEERFUL LADY. "OWN SUITE, TV, RADIO, AND THE USE OF CAR. TEA IN BED ON SUNDAYS. PENSION SCHEME." HEAVEN FORBID. OH, ALL RIGHT. "MRS. FORBES ALEXBRIDGE. SETTING UP HOUSE NEAR MONTE CARLO." THEY WON'T HAVE ANY FOREIGNERS, OF COURSE. "OWN GAMING ALLOWANCE." BUT I DON'T APPROVE OF GAMBLING. "MRS. HAMILTON POTTS." THE DINGLEY STUD FARM, YOU KNOW. "7 CHILDREN. ELDEST, 7." OH, NO, THANK YOU. PERHAPS IF I MIGHT HAVE A QUIET WORD WITH MRS. BINSTER? I AM MRS. BINSTER. OH, I SEE. WELL, AS A MATTER OF FACT, I WONDERED IF THERE MIGHT BE A POSITION AT ACKENTHORPE HALL. ACKENTHORPE HALL? YES, ACKENTHORPE HALL. OH, YES. UH...I THINK I CAN ACCOMMODATE YOU. YES. THERE'S ALWAYS A VACANCY THERE. THANK YOU. [DOG WHINING] [RINGING] YES? I'M JANE, FROM MRS. BINSTER'S EMPLOYMENT AGENCY-- THE NEW MAID. WELL, YOU LOOK OLD ENOUGH TO KNOW BETTER. COME IN. I'M TO SEE MISS ACKENTHORPE. YOU'RE EXPECTED. IN THERE. MISS ACKENTHORPE. YES? I'M JANE. THE NEW MAID? YES. JANE MARPLE. NOW, IF YOU'LL KINDLY SHOW ME WHERE I'M TO PUT MY THINGS, I-- OH, YES. YES, OF COURSE. BUT I'M WONDERING IF THIS POST IS REALLY WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR, MISS MARPLE. WELL, NATURALLY, OTHERWISE I WOULDN'T BE HERE. I DON'T WANT A HOUSEKEEPER, YOU KNOW. I WANT SOMEONE TO-- WELL, TO DO THE WORK. YES. YOU WANT COOKING, WASHING UP, BEDS MADE, FLOORS SCRUBBED, FIRES LIT, ASHES TAKEN AWAY. I QUITE UNDERSTAND. WELL, I--I HOPE YOU'LL FIND US SUITABLE. OH, I'M SURE I SHALL. PERHAPS YOU WON'T FIND THE WORK TOO EXACTING. THERE ARE ONLY THE THREE OF US-- MYSELF, MY NEPHEW, DOWN FROM SCHOOL FOR THE HOLIDAYS, AND THEN THERE'S FATHER. MAY I SHOW YOU TO YOUR ROOM? YES, CERTAINLY. I'LL TAKE THAT, MY DEAR. PERHAPS THE CLUBS, IF YOU WOULDN'T MIND. I MUST KEEP FIT, YOU KNOW. YES, OF COURSE. OUR STAFF CONSISTS OF HILLMAN, THE GARDENER, AND MRS. KIDDER-- SHE LET YOU IN. SHE COMES IN FROM THE VILLAGE 3 AFTERNOONS A WEEK TO DO THE ROUGH WORK. THAT WAS MY GRANDFATHER. HE FOUNDED THE FAMILY FORTUNE-- TEA BISCUITS, YOU KNOW. OH, YES. AND VERY EXCELLENT BISCUITS THEY WERE, TOO. QUITE A SEVERE MAN, I'M AFRAID. MISS MARPLE, I THINK IT ONLY FAIR TO EXPLAIN TO YOU THAT MY FATHER HIMSELF IS... WELL, QUITE FRANKLY, HE'S A BIT DIFFICULT AT TIMES. HE'S AN INVALID, YOU KNOW. HE'S VERY KEEN ON ECONOMY, AND HE SOMETIMES SAYS THINGS THAT UPSET PEOPLE. I WOULDN'T WANT YOU TO-- OH, I'M QUITE USED TO LOOKING AFTER ELDERLY PEOPLE OF ALL SORTS. WE'LL MANAGE. Man: EMMA! EMMA! I HEAR YOU. YES, FATHER. EXCUSE ME ONE MOMENT. Man: DON'T TRY TO SNEAK OFF. IS THAT THE NEW GIRL WITH YOU? WELL, UH... YES, FATHER. HOPE SHE'S GOT A BIT MORE MEAT ON HER THAN THE LAST ONE. CAN'T STAND THEM SKINNY. WELL, DON'T JUST STAND THERE BOGGLING, GIRL. BRING HER IN. I WANT TO LOOK AT HER. YES. UM... WILL YOU COME IN, PLEASE? FATHER, THIS IS MISS MARPLE... UH, JANE. AND A PLAINER JANE I'VE NEVER SET EYES ON IN ME LIFE. WELL, WE CAN'T ALL BE YOUNG AND HANDSOME, CAN WE, MR. ACKENTHORPE? THERE IS ONE THING I CANNOT TOLERATE. THAT IS IMPERTINENCE! WELL, WE SHOULD GET ON ADMIRABLY. NEITHER CAN I. WELL, IF YOU'RE COMING TO STAY HERE, AND I SUPPOSE YOU'VE GOT TO, THERE'S ONE THING YOU'D BETTER UNDERSTAND STRAIGHTAWAY. BECAUSE I LIVE IN A BIG HOUSE, IT DOESN'T NECESSARILY FOLLOW THAT I'M A RICH MAN, SO THERE'S NO GOOD COMING HERE WITH EXTRAVAGANT IDEAS. I LIVE HERE BECAUSE I WANT TO, NOT BECAUSE I CAN AFFORD IT. FATHER, DON'T YOU THINK-- NO, I DON'T. CAN YOU COOK? IF YOU WANT GOOD ENGLISH COOKING, YES. COD'S AS GOOD AS LOBSTER ANY DAY, AND MUCH CHEAPER. WELL, THAT DEPENDS ON WHETHER OR NOT ONE HAS A PALATE UNSULLIED BY CHEAP OPIATES. IF YOU MEAN WHAT I THINK YOU MEAN, I'D HAVE YOU KNOW THIS CHEROOT COST 2 SHILLINGS. YES, QUITE. UM, I'LL SHOW MISS MARPLE TO HER ROOM. THIS WAY, PLEASE. GOOD IDEA. THAT WAS HILLMAN, THE GARDENER. WHEN MR. ACKENTHORPE WANTS TO MOVE ABOUT, HE ALWAYS CALLS HIM. THEY'RE QUITE CLOSE. WILL YOU BE STAYING MISS MARPLE...JANE? MY DEAR LADY, OF COURSE. I'M SO GLAD. Father: EMMA! COME BACK HERE. YOU'VE FORGOTTEN MY MEDICINE. EXCUSE ME A MOMENT. UM, THAT'S YOUR ROOM, JUST DOWN THERE-- THE DOOR OPPOSITE THE HEAD OF THE SMALL STAIRS. I'LL FIND IT. DON'T YOU WORRY. MAY I GIVE YOU THOSE? YES, OF COURSE. ALL RIGHT? YES. OHH. [KNOCKS] Miss Marple: COME OUT AT ONCE! I ADVISE YOU TO COME OUT. VERY WELL. [VASE CRASHING] [CREAKING] AAH! YOU'RE MISS EMMA'S NEPHEW, I PRESUME? YES-- ALEXANDER EASTLEY. HOW DO YOU DO? HOW DO YOU DO? I'M JANE-- JANE MARPLE. YES. IT IS DISAPPOINTING, ISN'T IT? I'D RATHER HOPED FOR THE JAYNE MANSFIELD TYPE. I SEE YOU HAVE SOMETHING IN COMMON WITH YOUR GRANDFATHER. OH, WE'RE VERY ALIKE IN MANY WAYS. MIND YOU, I'M NOT MEAN WITH MONEY. HE'LL STOP THAT VASE OUT OF YOUR WAGES, YOU KNOW. IT'S JUST AS WELL YOU GOT OUT OF THE WAY. OTHERWISE... IT'D HAVE BEEN MY HEAD, AND YOU'D HAVE GOT 10 YEARS. THAT IS STILL POSSIBLE. YOU KNOW, IT ISN'T JUST THAT YOU DON'T LOOK LIKE JAYNE MANSFIELD. YOU'RE NOT MY IDEA OF A MAID, EITHER. WELL, QUITE HONESTLY, I DON'T THINK YOU'D BE EVERYBODY'S IDEA OF A BOY. YOU KNOW, THERE'S SOMETHING DECIDEDLY FISHY ABOUT YOU. I CAN SEE YOU'LL HAVE TO GO. AFTER MRS. KIDDER, OF COURSE-- SHE'S NEXT. DEPRESSING CREATURE. SO WAS ANNIE. ANNIE? YOUR PREDECESSOR. THIN AS A RAKE AND A SHOCKING COOK. CAN YOU COOK? WELL, I THINK I'VE DONE BETTER THAN ANNIE. GRANDFATHER'S LIKE THAT, TOO, AND HE HATES HIS DINNER TO BE LATE. I'D LEAVE YOUR UNPACKING UNTIL LATER IF I WERE YOU. WELL, IN THAT CASE, HADN'T YOU BETTER SHOW ME THE WAY TO THE KITCHEN, ALEXANDER? VERY WELL...JANE. Father: EMMA! THAT'S HIM, ALWAYS SHOUTING ABOUT SOMETHING, MOSTLY MONEY. THIS WAY. EMMA! OF COURSE, THEY'RE ALL WAITING FOR HIM TO DROP DEAD, YOU KNOW. FRIGHTFUL PACK OF VULTURES, OUR FAMILY-- EXCEPT POSSIBLY AUNT EMMA. AND WHO ARE THESE VULTURES? OH, THERE'S UNCLE HAROLD-- STINKING RICH AND JUST AS MEAN. UNCLE ALBERT-- DEADLY DULL, POOR FELLOW. THEN THERE'S UNCLE CEDRIC. HE PAINTS, BUT NOT FOR ART'S SAKE. DO YOU KNOW, LAST YEAR HE AND ONE OF HIS MODELS... [WHISPERING] ALEXANDER! WELL, HE'S LIKE THAT. THERE WAS AN UNCLE EDMUND. WAS? YES. STOPPED A WHOLE BOMB DURING THE WAR, ALL BY HIMSELF. WASN'T ANOTHER MAN AROUND FOR MILES-- DESERTING, PROBABLY. AND WHO CAN BE HELD RESPONSIBLE FOR YOU? WELL PUT. MUMMY'S NAME WAS EDITH, BUT SHE'S DEAD. DADDY'S BRIAN EASTLEY, YOU KNOW. OH? YOU KNOW, THE FIGHTER ACE. BATTLE OF BRITAIN. OH, THE BRIAN EASTLEY. YES. I'M GOING TO SET HIM UP IN BUSINESS WHEN I GET MY INHERITANCE FROM GRANDFATHER. HERE WE ARE. OH, THERE YOU ARE, AND ABOUT TIME, TOO. WELL, I'M OFF. I WOULDN'T STAY IN THIS PLACE AFTER DARK, NOT FOR ALL THE TEA IN CHINA. NOW, LOOK-- THE POTS AND PANS ARE ON THAT SHELF THERE, OVER THE STOVE. OH, YES. AND THE GROCERIES AND PROVISIONS IN THERE. THANK YOU. WELL, CHEERIO. GOOD DAY. GOOD DAY, MRS. KIDDER. WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH YOU? I WAS MERELY BEING POLITE. CHARMING, ISN'T SHE, JANE? HA HA! I THINK YOU SHOULD SEE THIS. COME ON. WHAT?

I SEE YOU MADE YOURSELF COMFORTABLE. I TRUST YOU HAVE NO OBJECTION? MAYBE. I SHOULDN'T MAKE YOURSELF TOO COMFORTABLE, IF I WAS YOU. [DOOR SHUTS] [SIGHS] [DOORBELL RINGS] YES? OH. WHO ARE YOU? I'M THE NEW MAID...SIR. DR. QUIMPER. YOU'LL GET USED TO SEEING ME HERE. ALEXANDER, I SUPPOSE. YES, I'M AFRAID SO. WELL, MR. ACKENTHORPE WILL BE EXPECTING ME. OH, YES. I'LL SHOW YOU UP. OH, THAT WON'T BE... DOCTOR-- WHERE ON EARTH ARE MY CONFOUNDED MATCHES? OH, IT'S YOU. GOOD MORNING. MORNING. WHAT ARE YOU DOING IN HERE? SNOOPING, I SUPPOSE. WHERE ARE MY MATCHES? IF YOU'RE GOING TO SMOKE, WE'D BETTER HAVE SOME WINDOWS OPEN. I'M A GREAT BELIEVER IN FRESH AIR. AREN'T YOU, DOCTOR? WHY, UH, YES, I AM, MISS, UH... MARPLE, HER NAME. MARBLE, HER NATURE. THAT'S RIGHT. LET HER GIVE ME DOUBLE PNEUMONIA. IF YOU CAN'T KILL ME OFF ONE WAY, YOU'LL KILL ME OFF ANOTHER. NONSENSE. YOU'RE GOING TO LIVE TO BE 100 IN SPITE OF ANYTHING I CAN DO. WELL, IN THAT CASE, TELL THAT WOMAN TO STOP OPENING WINDOWS AND TO LIGHT MY CHEROOT. IS THERE ANY CHANCE THAT'LL SEND HIM TO SLEEP, DOCTOR? I'M AFRAID IT'S A STIMULANT. ROLL OVER. OH, DEAR. HOLD IT CLOSER, WOMAN. OWW! OOH! YOUR HOMETOWN LOST A GOOD HORSE DOCTOR WHEN YOU LEFT, QUIMPER. MATTER OF FACT, I WAS VERY BAD WITH THE HORSES. HOW'D THE BIRTHDAY PARTY GO? ALL THE FAMILY GET DOWN ALL RIGHT? OF COURSE THEY DID. THEY'D A WHOLE WEEKEND OF IT-- FREE BOARD AND LODGING FROM FRIDAY NIGHT. FRIDAY. WHAT'S THAT TO DO WITH YOU? OH, NOTHING. IT JUST HAPPENED TO BE AN INTERESTING DAY FOR ME, TOO. HOW OLD WERE YOU, MR. ACKENTHORPE? MIND YOUR BUSINESS. ANYHOW, IT WAS A MISERABLE WEEKEND, AND I HOPE IT WILL BE A LONG TIME BEFORE I HAVE TO PUT UP WITH THE WHOLE PACK OF THEM AGAIN. NOT A VERY NICE WAY TO TALK ABOUT ONE'S FAMILY. NOT A VERY NICE FAMILY. DO YOU KNOW WHAT THAT OVERGROWN BEATNIK CEDRIC DID? TOLD EMMA RIGHT IN FRONT OF MY EYES SHE OUGHT TO GET OUT OF HERE-- GET MARRIED OR SOMETHING. TRIED TO MAKE HER AS SELFISH AS HE IS. OH, I DON'T KNOW. IF EMMA DID MARRY, IT WOULDN'T BE SUCH A BAD THING. [DOOR OPENS] OH. FATHER, I THOUGHT I'D TELL YOU I'M JUST GOING INTO TOWN. I'LL BE LEAVING IN A MOMENT. CAN I GIVE YOU A LIFT? WHAT DO YOU WANT TO GO INTO TOWN FOR? CAN'T SHE GO FOR WHATEVER IT IS? WELL, IT'S TRADESMEN, FATHER. A FEW BILLS TO PAY. OH, MONEY. THAT'S A DIFFERENT THING. CAN'T TRUST ANYBODY THESE DAYS. ALL RIGHT. OFF YOU GO. IN THAT CASE, MAY I BE OF SERVICE? THANK YOU. OF COURSE YOU CAN, QUIMPER. SAVES THE PRICE OF A TAXI. PAY YOU ENOUGH AS IT IS. IT'LL BE ON YOUR BILL. ARE YOU READY NOW? ONLY MY COAT. GOOD. FRIDAY, THEN, MR. ACKENTHORPE. GOOD DAY, MISS MARPLE. GOOD DAY, DOCTOR.

[CAR STARTS, THEN DRIVES AWAY] [TRAIN WHISTLE BLOWS] YOUR WEIGHT ISN'T QUITE EVENLY DISTRIBUTED. I'LL HAVE YOU KNOW THAT I WON THE LADIES' OPEN HANDICAP IN 1921. REALLY? I'M SURE YOU HAVE MANY THINGS TO DO. NOT AT ALL. I'M MOST INTERESTED. WE'VE NEVER HAD A GOLF-PLAYING MAID BEFORE. YOU MAY HAVE HEARD THAT THIS IS THE AGE OF THE COMMON WOMAN. YOU HOOKED. I'M AWARE OF IT. YOU KNOW SOMETHING? WHAT? I BELIEVE YOU PULLED THOSE SHOTS ON PURPOSE. ALEXANDER, IF YOU WISH TO BE HELPFUL AT ALL, WILL YOU KINDLY LOOK FOR THE HOOK WHILE I LOOK FOR THE SLICE? [TRAIN HONKS] FOUND YOURS YET? YES. HAVE YOU? DISAPPEARED WITHOUT A TRACE. OH, WELL, FORTUNATELY, I HAVE SOME MORE. AT THE PRESENT RATE, YOU'RE GOING TO NEED THEM. PERHAPS YOU'D CARE TO DEMONSTRATE THE NEXT ONE. CERTAINLY. LET'S SEE HOW CLOSE YOU CAN GET TO THOSE OUTBUILDINGS. YES. I THINK THAT'S POSSIBLE. FAIR. HMPH. YOU KNOW PERFECTLY WELL IT WAS SUPERB FOR A BOY OF MY AGE. RIGHT ON THE FAIRWAY. A CHIP AND A PUTT, AND I'D HAVE HOLED OUT IN 3. DOES YOUR GRANDFATHER KEEP HORSES, ALEXANDER? HE DID. NOW HE JUST KEEPS A FEW RELICS OF A MORE SPACIOUS AGE. NOSTALGIA, YOU KNOW. A FAILING OF THE OLD, I SUPPOSE. LIKE TO LOOK? WELL, I THINK I'M OLD ENOUGH. DON'T YOU? AN OLD-FASHIONED PONY CHAISE. THEY USED THAT FOR GOING TO THE VILLAGE. I SUPPOSE THEY USED THE VICTORIA FOR GOING TO CHURCH. YES--ON SUNDAYS IN THE SUMMER, I BELIEVE. AND THE BROUGHAM'S FOR VISITING IN THE WINTER, PERHAPS. YES, I EXPECT SO. IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE HAUNTED HERE, YOU KNOW. GRANDFATHER FOUND A MAN HANGING FROM THIS RAFTER. GOOD HEAVENS. HE'D BEEN DEAD FOR A WEEK. THAT WILL DO, ALEXANDER. ALL PURPLE, YOU KNOW. ALEXANDER! [RUSTLING] WHAT WAS THAT? I WONDER. ALL RIGHT. I'LL LOOK. ALL YOURS. [CHICKENS SQUAWKING] EEH! DEAR, DEAR, WE ARE NERVOUS, AREN'T WE? PITY. WELL, WHAT DID YOU EXPECT TO FIND? BODIES. WHAT? LIVE ONES, OF COURSE. USED TO BE QUITE THE SPOT FOR COURTING COUPLES FROM THE TOWN. REALLY? TILL GRANDFATHER GOT HILLMAN TO PUT A STOP TO IT--SPOILSPORT. QUITE EXTRAORDINARY, THE GOINGS-ON HERE. APPARENTLY, THERE WAS THIS GIRL-- THAT'S ENOUGH, ALEXANDER. THERE MAY BE SOME OTHER POOR BIRD TRAPPED. [FRERE JACQUES PLAYING] LOOK AT THIS. SOMEBODY ELSE MUST HAVE BEEN IN HERE. THIS ISN'T AUNT EMMA'S. IT'S MINE. I MUST HAVE DROPPED IT. THANK YOU SO MUCH. IT WAS BEQUEATHED TO ME. YOU'RE NOT BY ANY CHANCE ON THE RUN FROM THE POLICE, ARE YOU? TOO MUCH TELEVISION. YOU MUST LEARN TO RATIONALIZE YOUR IMAGINATION. WHAT'S BEHIND THERE? MORE RELICS FROM THE PAST? MATTER OF FACT, YES-- THE FRUITS OF GRANDFATHER'S EGYPTIAN PHASE. INDEED? HOW INTERESTING. OH! NO ONE'S ALLOWED IN THERE. LET GO OF MY WRIST! WHAT ARE YOU UP TO? UP TO? THE BOY WAS SIMPLY SHOWING ME ROUND. WHAT BOY? ALEXANDER. HE-- YOU'RE LYING. ALEXANDER, COME OUT OF THERE AT ONCE! I THOUGHT DISCRETION THE BETTER PART OF VALOR, JANE. THIS FELLOW'S NOT ABOVE CLIPPING A PERSON'S EAR. YOU KNOW YOUR GRANDFATHER DON'T LIKE NO ONE SNEAKING ROUND HERE. DON'T THINK I WON'T TELL HIM, NEITHER. DESPITE THE DOUBLE NEGATIVES, I'M SURE YOU WILL. COME, JANE. Miss Marple: GOOD FOR YOU, YOUNG MAN. [FRERE JACQUES PLAYING] [DOG BARKS] [TRAIN WHISTLE BLOWS IN DISTANCE] [TRAIN PASSES NEARBY] [CLOCK STRIKING] [COUGH] OH... WHAT? NO! NO! NOW, LISTEN, MR. STRINGER. I WANT YOU TO INFORM THE POLICE ANONYMOUSLY. DON'T MENTION ME YET. I WISH TO BE IN AT THE KILL, SO TO SPEAK. MISS MARPLE, REALLY. ALL RIGHT, BUT IT MAKES MY BLOOD RUN COLD TO THINK OF YOU THERE ALONE. I WAS WONDERING-- PERHAPS THEY HAVE A VACANCY FOR A GARDENER. OH, THEY'VE GOT ONE. VERY WELL. I'LL DO AS YOU SAY. MISS MARPLE, THE COMPACT! IF THE MURDERER SHOULD KNOW THAT YOU HAVE IT-- I'LL BE CAREFUL, DEAR MR. STRINGER. NOW, PHONE THE INSPECTOR RIGHT AWAY. WELL? NEVER SEEN HER BEFORE IN MY LIFE. NO. SHE'S NOT FROM THESE PARTS. WELL, WHOEVER SHE IS, I WANT HER OUT OF HERE AT ONCE. IF YOU HADN'T LEFT THE BARN DOOR UNLOCKED, THIS WOULDN'T HAVE HAPPENED. WE WOULDN'T HAVE HAD ALL THESE PEOPLE POKING THEIR NOSES INTO EVERYTHING. ARE YOU ALL RIGHT, FATHER? OF COURSE I'M ALL RIGHT. THINK I'VE NEVER SEEN A CORPSE BEFORE? BE ONE MYSELF SOON. PERHAPS YOU'D BETTER GO BACK TO THE HOUSE. I'LL FOLLOW YOU UP. WHOEVER IT WAS TRIED TO GET HER IN HERE FIRST. MUST HAVE TAKEN THE STRENGTH OF A MANIAC TO SHIFT IT THIS FAR. INSPECTOR? OH, YES, DOCTOR. I DON'T KNOW WHETHER THIS IS BEING HELPFUL... GO ON. WELL, THE WOMAN-- NO ONE RECOGNIZED HER, AND HER CLOTHES STRUCK ME AS BEING FOREIGN, PERHAPS FRENCH. HMM... YES. THAT'S VERY INTERESTING. YES. THANK YOU,DOCTOR. WELL, IT WAS JUST A THOUGHT. MAY BE A USEFUL ONE. THANK YOU. WELL, THAT WOULD EXPLAIN WHY I DIDN'T RECOGNIZE HER, SIR. I KNOW EVERY FACE FOR MILES AROUND. I'M SURE YOU DO, SERGEANT. STILL, I HAVE TO START WITH THE ASSUMPTION THERE'S SOME CONNECTION BETWEEN HER AND THE FAMILY. I THINK I'LL GET THE WHOLE BUNCH DOWN HERE. HMM. THERE WILL BE FIREWORKS, SIR. THEY HATE THE SIGHT OF EACH OTHER. SO I BELIEVE. ANYWAY, ROUTINE FIRST. HAVE THEY GOT ANY OTHER SERVANTS APART FROM THIS GARDENER? Miss Marple: YES, THEY HAVE, INSPECTOR. GOOD LORD. YOU! YES. DOTTY OLD ME. IN THERE, PLEASE. IT'S ONLY A CIGARETTE PACKET. OF DOUBTFUL SIGNIFICANCE, I'D SAY. I'LL BEAR YOUR VIEWS IN MIND. ANY IDEA WHAT YOU EXPECT YOUR FELLOWS TO FIND? CLUES. WELL, NATURALLY. BUT DO YOU SERIOUSLY THINK THEY'LL FIND ANYTHING? WELL, SOMEBODY DRAGGED THE BODY FROM THERE OVER TO THERE. IT'S POSSIBLE SOMETHING COULD HAVE BEEN DROPPED IN THE PROCESS. DON'T YOU AGREE? YES. YES, I DO. DID YOU FIND ANYTHING? NO, INSPECTOR, NOT A THING. FAMILY'S HERE, BY THE WAY. THANK YOU. I'LL, UH, GET AROUND TO THEM LATER. THEY'LL ENJOY THAT, I'M SURE. GOOD HUNTING. Father: SOME SILLY IDIOT GOES AND STRANGLES HIS GIRLFRIEND-- WHICH SHE PROBABLY RICHLY DESERVED-- AND WHAT DO THEY DO? SWARM ALL OVER THE PLACE, MESS ABOUT IN OUR PRIVATE AFFAIRS. I SAID TO THIS-- THIS INSPECTOR FELLOW-- HADDOCK OR WHATEVER HIS NAME IS-- CRADDOCK, SIR. SHALL I POUR? OF COURSE. ANYWAY, I SAID TO THIS FELLOW HADDOCK THAT NO MEMBER OF MY FAMILY HAD EVER SEEN THE WOMAN BEFORE. THAT WAS FINAL. WOW. WHAT MAKES YOU SO SURE OF THAT, FATHER? OH, NOW LOOK HERE, CEDRIC, THIS IS ABSURD. WELL, AFTER ALL, HAROLD, SHE WASN'T SOMEBODY FROM AROUND HERE, AND SHE WAS FOUND IN OUR STABLE, WASN'T SHE? ONE OF US COULD HAVE KNOWN HER. SHE COULD HAVE BEEN YOUR GIRLFRIEND, DEAR BOY. WHAT? YES. YES, I SUPPOSE CEDRIC HAS A POINT THERE. HE NEVER HAS A POINT. I MEAN FROM THE POLICE POINT OF VIEW. IT'S ALL RIGHT FOR YOU, EASTLEY. I DON'T SUPPOSE YOU'RE TOO CONCERNED WITH THE FAMILY REPUTATION. AFTER ALL, YOU'RE NOT A MEMBER OF IT, ARE YOU, STRICTLY SPEAKING? WHAT I CAN'T UNDERSTAND IS WHO TELEPHONED THE POLICE. OH, I KNOW WHO DID THAT. OH? WHO? OBVIOUSLY SOMEONE WHO KNEW THE BODY WAS THERE. ANY COFFEE LEFT, JANE? [DOORBELL RINGS] HELP YOURSELF. IT CERTAINLY WASN'T ONE OF US. WHO KNOWS? WHO CARES WHO DID IT, ANYWAY? THE WOMAN WAS PROBABLY A SPY. THAT'S ABSURD, FATHER. WELL, THE POLICE THINK SHE WAS A FOREIGNER, DON'T THEY? LOTS OF ENGLISH GIRLS GO TO PARIS AND BUY FRENCH CLOTHES. DECENT ONES DON'T. DR. QUIMPER TO SEE YOU, MR. ACKENTHORPE. STILL GETTING SHOT WITH REVITALIZERS, FATHER? I'D TAKE ANYTHING TO OUTLIVE YOU LOT AND KEEP MY PROPERTY FROM YOUR THIEVING HANDS. WELL, I'LL JUST GO AND SEE IF I CAN BE OF ANY FURTHER ASSISTANCE TO THE POLICE. DELICIOUS COFFEE, JANE. BY THE WAY, THE INSPECTOR SAID HE'D BE INTERROGATING YOU ALL LATER. BETTER GET YOUR ALIBIS READY. OH, HE'S A BRIGHT BOY, THAT ONE. WELL, LET'S FACE IT. THE POLICE SAY THE WOMAN WAS MURDERED ON FRIDAY, AND WE WERE DOWN HERE LAST FRIDAY. THEY'RE GOING TO BE VERY INTERESTED IN ALL OF US. BUT NONE OF US WERE HERE TILL QUITE LATE. YES, BUT THE POINT IS, WHAT WERE WE ALL DOING EARLIER? ALBERT, WHAT ABOUT YOU? ME? YES, YOU. AND DON'T TELL ME YOU WERE SITTING IN YOUR OFFICE ALL DAY. I--WELL, NO. UH-HUH? AS A MATTER OF FACT, THERE WAS A FILM THAT I PARTICULARLY WANTED TO SEE. OH, BRIGITTE BARDOT? NOW, LOOK, CEDRIC, THIS IS PREPOSTEROUS. BUT IS IT, HAROLD? VERY WELL. WHAT ABOUT YOU? OR CAN YOUR SECRETARY VERIFY ALL YOUR MOVEMENTS ON THAT DAY? THAT'S NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS. WELL, I'M IN THE CLEAR. I WAS AT MY CLUB. IT HAS A BACK DOOR, HASN'T IT? YES, I THINK SO, BUT I DIDN'T GET HERE UNTIL SATURDAY. BUT YOU COULD HAVE LUGGED THE BODY UP HERE ON FRIDAY, SLIPPED BACK TO LONDON, AND BE SITTING IN YOUR USUAL CHAIR WHEN THE CLUB CLOSED. AND I SUPPOSE ONE OF YOUR WOMAN FRIENDS CAN VOUCH FOR YOU. OH, I'M CERTAIN MY CURRENT COMFORT WILL SATISFY THE INSPECTOR COMPLETELY, AS NO DOUBT WILL YOUR SECRETARY. WHEN YOU'VE FINISHED HERE, WILL YOU KINDLY BRING ME SOME FRESH COFFEE INTO THE LIBRARY? CERTAINLY, SIR. WELL, WELL. JUMPY, ISN'T HE? AND YOU'RE VERY CALM. BUT THEN, I HAVE NO REASON NOT TO BE. I'VE JUST BEEN THINKING. IF THAT WOMAN WAS FOREIGN-- YOU SHOULD THINK OF GIRLS MORE OFTEN, ALBERT. MIGHT BRING ABOUT SOME INTERESTING CHANGES IN YOU. I KNOW IT'S LAUGHABLE-- I AGREE. NO, BUT I MEAN, IF SHE WAS FRENCH... COULD BE HER, I SUPPOSE. ALL RIGHT, I GIVE UP. COULD BE WHO? THAT MARTINE WOMAN. MARTINE? YES. YOU KNOW, THAT FRENCH FARM GIRL WE HAD ALL THE TROUBLE ABOUT? THE ONE EDMUND WAS SO INFATUATED WITH BEFORE HE WAS KILLED? BUT THAT WAS AGES AGO. YES, I KNOW. STILL, I SUPPOSE IT IS POSSIBLE. BUT WHY SHOULD SHE TURN UP DEAD IN OUR STABLE 16 YEARS LATER? OH, IT'S PREPOSTEROUS. WELL, IT ISN'T MY IDEA. WELL, WHOSE IDEA IS IT, THEN? WELL...EMMA'S. EMMA? EMMA'S? THAT'S ODD. [WHISPERING] Paul! DARLING... NO, PAUL, PLEASE. HOW MUCH LONGER ARE WE GOING ON LIKE THIS, EMMA? WE'VE GOT TO TELL THE OLD MAN, WHETHER HE LIKES IT OR NOT. NOT YET. PLEASE, NOT YET. WHY? WHY? PAUL, I... I THINK SOMEONE IN THE FAMILY MAY BE A MURDERER. EMMA. I'VE HAD A LETTER. I CAN'T KEEP IT TO MYSELF ANY LONGER. I WANT YOU TO READ IT. I'M AFRAID MY FRENCH ISN'T UP TO THIS, EMMA. OH. "DEAR MISS ACKENTHORPE, "YOU WILL BE SURPRISED TO HEAR "AFTER SO MANY YEARS "THAT YOU HAVE A SISTER-IN-LAW. "I MARRIED YOUR BROTHER EDMUND "2 DAYS BEFORE HE WAS KILLED IN ACTION. "I DECIDED IT WAS BEST TO FORGET THE MARRIAGE, "BUT NOW I AM PLANNING A VISIT TO ENGLAND, "AND I FIND I DO WISH TO MEET YOU ALL. "I WRITE TO YOU INSTEAD OF YOUR FATHER "BECAUSE I UNDERSTAND HE IS A SICK MAN, "AND MY EXISTENCE MAY COME AS A SHOCK TO HIM, "AS IT MUST BE TO YOU ALL. "SINCERELY YOURS, MARTINE ACKENTHORPE." BUT I THOUGHT EDMUND WAS KILLED BEFORE THEY HAD A CHANCE TO MARRY. THAT'S WHAT WE ALL THOUGHT. WHAT'S ON YOUR MIND, EMMA? OH, DON'T YOU SEE? THE STRANGLED WOMAN-- IT MUST HAVE BEEN MARTINE. LISTEN, IF SHE COULD HAVE PROVED SHE WAS REALLY EDMUND'S WIDOW, SHE'D HAVE BEEN ENTITLED TO A SHARE IN THE WILL. OH, I SEE. PAUL, WHAT SHALL I DO? HAVE YOU TOLD THE OTHERS? NO. I DID SUGGEST TO ALBERT THAT IF THE WOMAN WAS FRENCH, SHE MIGHT BE MARTINE. WHAT DID HE SAY? HE SAID IT WAS FANTASTIC, BUT I THINK HE WAS WORRIED. YOU'LL HAVE TO TELL THE POLICE. THEY'RE BOUND TO THINK ONE OF THE FAMILY DID THIS. WHAT ELSE CAN YOU DO? I DON'T KNOW. I DON'T KNOW. I THINK YOU MUST TELL THEM. I'LL HAVE TO THINK ABOUT THIS. YOU'D BETTER GO. GOOD AFTERNOON. GOOD AFTERNOON. OH, THERE YOU ARE. THE TRAIN WAS LATE, MISS MARPLE. OH, GOOD EVENING, INSPECTOR. I SUPPOSE YOU KNEW ABOUT THIS COMPACT BUSINESS, TOO. WELL, I-- BEFORE I DID, NO DOUBT. WELL, YOU SEE-- I THOUGHT IT BEST TO BRING THE INSPECTOR IN ON THIS AFTER ALL. OH, YES. VERY WISE. VERY WISE. I'M GLAD YOU THINK SO. WITHHOLDING INFORMATION FROM THE POLICE IS A VERY SERIOUS MATTER. OH, I KNOW, INSPECTOR, AND I'M MOST AWFULLY SORRY. WILL YOU TAKE TEA? THANK YOU, NO. DON'T YOU REALIZE WHAT THIS MEANS, THE COMPACT HAVING BEEN STOLEN FROM YOUR ROOM? COFFEE, PERHAPS? IT MEANS THAT THE THIEF AND THE MURDERER ARE ALMOST CERTAINLY ONE AND THE SAME AND THAT HE OR SHEIS IN THAT HOUSE AND THAT YOUR LIFE MAY BE IN GREAT DANGER. OH, I SAY! DO YOU REALLY THINK SO? I MUST ASK YOU TO GIVE THE WHOLE THING UP IMMEDIATELY-- TONIGHT. YES, OF COURSE. INDEED YOU MUST, MISS MARPLE. VERY WELL, THEN. I'LL GIVE IN MY NOTICE TOMORROW. GOOD. THAT'S SETTLED, THEN. IT HAS TO BE A MONTH'S NOTICE, YOU KNOW. WILL YOU HAVE A SMALL BEER, INSPECTOR? MISS MARPLE, I... OH, WHAT'S THE USE? GOOD NIGHT. GOOD NIGHT. WELL, NOW, HOW DID YOU GET ON AT THE PROBATE REGISTRY? WELL, REALLY, MISS MARPLE, I THINK IN VIEW OF WHAT THE INSPECTOR SAID-- DID YOU SEE THE WILL? YES. AND WHAT DID IT SAY? WELL, OLD MR. ACKENTHORPE'S FATHER OBVIOUSLY DIDN'T GET ON VERY WELL WITH HIM. I'M NOT SURPRISED AT THAT. GO ON. YOU SEE, THE HOUSE AND THE INCOME FROM THE FAMILY FORTUNE ARE HIS, BUT HE CAN'T TOUCH THE FORTUNE ITSELF. THAT'S THE FIRST POINT. YES? THE SECOND POINT IS THAT THE FORTUNE GOES TO HIS CHILDREN ON HIS DEATH. THAT IS, TO EMMA, CEDRIC, HAROLD, AND ALBERT. YES. TWO OF THE OTHERS NAMED IN THE WILL-- EDITH AND EDMUND-- ARE ALREADY DEAD, OF COURSE. HMM. THAT MUCH MORE FOR THE REST, EH? WELL, YOUNG ALEXANDER, EDITH'S SON, GETS HER SHARE. OH, WHAT ABOUT THE BOY'S FATHER--EASTLEY? NEXT OF KIN ONLY COME IN FOR A SHARE IF THERE'S NO ISSUE OF A MARRIAGE. SO EASTLEY'S ONLY INTEREST IS HOW MUCH YOUNG ALEXANDER GETS. DR. QUIMPER TO SEE YOU, SIR. OH, YES. SEND HIM IN. YOUR CALL TO THE PROBATE REGISTRY HAS BEEN VERY USEFUL. THANKS. MORNING, INSPECTOR. OH, MORNING, DOCTOR. SIT DOWN. THANK YOU. HAVE YOU FOUND OUT WHO THE WOMAN IS YET? THE FRENCH POLICE HAVEN'T COME UP WITH ANYTHING SO FAR, SIR. OH, YOU ARE WORKING ON THE ASSUMPTION THAT SHE'S FRENCH, THEN? THE CLOTHES AND MAKEUP DID TURN OUT TO BE MADE IN PARIS, YES. IS THAT WHAT YOU WANTED TO SEE ME ABOUT? NO, SIR. I UNDERSTAND LAST CHRISTMAS, OLD MR. ACKENTHORPE HAD A STOMACH UPSET. YES. HE'S INCLINED TO OVERINDULGE WHEN THERE'S TOO MUCH RICH FOOD ABOUT. BUT HE SAID YOU'D ASKED HIM A LOT OF QUESTIONS, AS THOUGH YOU SUSPECTED ARSENIC POISONING. ALL RIGHT. FOR THE MOMENT, I DID SUSPECT SOMETHING WAS A BIT ODD. DIDN'T YOU RUN A FOOD TEST? NO. WHY NOT? WELL, THERE WAS NOTHING POSITIVE-- NO HISTORY OF CHRONIC GASTRIC TROUBLES SUCH AS ONE WOULD EXPECT TO FIND IN THE CLASSIC METHOD OF ARSENIC POISONING. YOU MEAN, SMALL DOSES ADMINISTERED REGULARLY? EXACTLY. [TELEPHONE RINGS] EXCUSE ME. YES? Man: MISS ACKENTHORPE FOR YOU, SIR. OH, PUT HER ON. MISS ACKENTHORPE. EMMA? YES. Emma: HELLO? HELLO. MORNING. I'VE HAD A LETTER. I SEE. WELL, WOULD YOU READ THE LETTER TO ME? [EMMA SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY] THANK YOU. I'D LIKE TO SEND ROUND FOR THAT LETTER IF YOU DON'T MIND, MISS ACKENTHORPE. YES, WE'LL CHECK WITH THE FRENCH POLICE. THANK YOU. GOOD-BYE. DO YOU KNOW WHAT THAT WAS ABOUT, DOCTOR? YES, I... I THINK I DO. WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME? I'M IN LOVE WITH EMMA, INSPECTOR. I WANT TO MARRY HER. AND I TOLD HER I THOUGHT SHE OUGHT TO TELL YOU ABOUT THIS. BUT YOU DIDN'T INSIST? NO. IT WAS IMPORTANT TO ME--TO US-- THAT SHE MADE UP HER OWN MIND. I UNDERSTAND, DOCTOR. WELL, THANK YOU. IS THAT ALL? DOCTOR, DO YOU THINK THE DEAD WOMAN IS MARTINE ACKENTHORPE? WELL, WHO ELSE COULD IT BE? DO YOU THINK SHE WAS KILLED BY A MEMBER OF THE FAMILY? I'D RATHER NOT ANSWER THAT, INSPECTOR. ALL RIGHT, DOCTOR. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU. [DOOR CLOSES] [DOOR OPENS] WELL, SIR? I'M WORRIED, BACON. ABOUT THE DOCTOR? NO, NO, NOT HIM. I'M WORRIED ABOUT MISS MARPLE. [THUNDER] [THUNDER] [MAN WHISTLINGFRERE JACQUES] LOOKING FOR SOMETHING, MISS MARPLE? NO! I... ARE YOU-- ARE YOU ALL RIGHT? YES, PERFECTLY. THANK YOU, MR. EASTLEY. WHAT IS IT YOU WANT? WELL, I JUST THOUGHT I'D TAKE UP THE OLD BOY'S NIGHTCAP AND SAVE YOU THE TROUBLE. THAT'S KIND OF YOU. IT ISREADY. [THUNDER] HMM. THE STORM, I EXPECT. THE ELECTRICITY SUPPLY IS RATHER SHAKY, LIKE THE REST OF THE PLACE. YOU'RE A LITTLE SHAKY, TOO, AREN'T YOU? OH, NO, NOT AT ALL. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. [THUNDER] [CREAK] [FOOTSTEPS] OH, MY GOODNESS! WHAT ARE YOU DOING? LOOKING FOR LIGHT. YOU OUGHT TO BE ASLEEP. I HAPPEN TO BE READING. OH. MAY I ASK WHAT YOU'RE DOING? TRYING TO PROVIDE LIGHT. OH, I SEE. WELL, YOU WON'T FIND IT THERE, YOU KNOW. INDEED. IT'S A POWER FAILURE. OFTEN HAPPENS. MAY I BORROW THIS? ALEXANDER, COME BACK! GOOD NIGHT, JANE. WHO'S THAT? WHO IS IT? OH, MR. CEDRIC, IT'S A POWER FAILURE. OFTEN HAPPENS. I'LL HAVE TO FIND SOME CANDLES, IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME. JUST A MINUTE. MY SISTER SAID YOU STARTED WORK HERE ONLY A FEW DAYS AGO. YES? YOU DON'T LOOK LIKE A DOMESTIC TO ME. I HAVE TO EARN MY LIVING, MR. ACKENTHORPE, LIKE ANYBODY ELSE. BUT THE DAY AFTER YOU ARRIVED, THE BODY WAS DISCOVERED. YOU FOUND IT, DIDN'T YOU? WHAT MAKES YOU THINK THAT? BECAUSE IT FITS, AND SO NEATLY. YOU TELEPHONED THE POLICE, DIDN'T YOU? I ASSURE YOU, I AM NOT THE PERSON WHO TELEPHONED THE POLICE. YOU ARE NOT? NO. WHO ARE YOU, AND WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE? I HAVE ALREADY TOLD YOU. WELL, I'M GOING TO WATCH YOU VERY CLOSELY, MISS MARPLE... JANE. OH, HILLMAN, I WANT TO HAVE A WORD WITH YOU. AHH. [CLOCK TICKING] [FRERE JACQUES PLAYING] [MUSIC STOPS] [EMMA SHOUTS] HELP! WHAT'S THE MATTER? WHAT IS IT? ALBERT. SEE TO ALBERT. OHH... ALEXANDER, CALL THE DOCTOR. QUICKLY! THERE WAS NOTHING I COULD DO FOR HIM, I'M AFRAID, INSPECTOR. HOW ARE THE OTHERS NOW? WELL, EMMA, CEDRIC, HAROLD, AND EASTLEY HAVE HAD ONLY COMPARATIVELY MINOR EFFECTS, AND THE OLD MAN WILL BE ALL RIGHT. HE'S A TOUGH OLD BIRD. THEY'LL BE RECOVERED BY MORNING. NO DOUBT ABOUT THE CAUSE? NO. THEY WERE ALL POISONED. WELL, THANK YOU, DOCTOR. Harold: QUIMPER! QUIMPER! HAROLD. I MIGHT HAVE EXPECTED HIM TO BELLOW THE HARDEST. THIS IS THE LAST. CHICKEN STOCK. THANK YOU. FINISHED, SERGEANT? JUST ABOUT, SIR. SEE THAT STUFF GETS DOWN TO THE LAB RIGHT AWAY. WE'RE PRETTY WELL ALL THROUGH FOR TONIGHT. WELL, MISS MARPLE? MUSHROOM SOUP, CURRIED DUCK, RICE, AND APPLE PIE. AH. THANK YOU. MUSHROOM SOUP OUT OF A CAN, I SUPPOSE. CERTAINLY NOT. HALF A POUND OF MUSHROOMS, CHICKEN STOCK, MILK, FLOUR, BUTTER, LEMON JUICE, TOUCH OF HERBS. HMM. MUSHROOMS. I HAD SOME OF THE SOUP MYSELF. SUPERB. OH, I'M SURE. THE PIE. I'M AFRAID I NEVER CAN RESIST MY OWN PIE, INSPECTOR. ANYBODY ELSE'S, OF COURSE... THE CURRY? EXACTLY. GOOD, OF COURSE, BUT RICE, YOU SEE-- FATTENING. AND AS I WAS HAVING THE PIE... WHERE DID THE DUCK COME FROM? OH, THOSE. MR. HAROLD SHOT THEM. HE SEEMS TO BE RATHER FOND OF KILLING THINGS. THE BOY, ALEXANDER-- HE DOESN'T SEEM TO HAVE HAD ANY CURRY, EITHER. NO. THOUGHT IT WOULD APPEAL TO HIM. CURIOUS CHILD. WELL, DID ANYONE COME INTO THE KITCHEN WHILE THE COOKING WAS GOING ON? NOT WHILE I WAS THERE. I DO HAVE OTHER DUTIES, YOU KNOW. ANYONE COULD HAVE COME IN, THEN. 6 PEOPLE ARE POISONED... ONLY ONE DIES. I'M THINKING ABOUT THAT, TOO, INSPECTOR. [DOOR OPENS] EXCUSE ME, SIR. MESSAGE FROM THE CHIEF CONSTABLE. HE'S WAITING UP TO HEAR YOUR REPORT. ALL RIGHT. IN PERSON, SIR. RIGHT, SERGEANT. GET THE CAR AROUND. I'LL BE OUT IN A MINUTE. VERY GOOD. I THINK THE 2 KILLINGS ARE CONNECTED, DON'T YOU? YES, I DO. AND WE'VE GOT TO FIND OUT WHO HAS THAT COMPACT, MISS MARPLE. SO FAR, I'VE ONLY BEEN ABLE TO SEARCH ONE ROOM. OH? WHOSE? UNFORTUNATELY, ALBERT'S. OH. MISS MARPLE, I HAVE TO GO NOW-- OH, YES, I KNOW. A POLICEMAN'S WORK IS NEVER DONE. [CHUCKLES] NOR A WOMAN'S. I WAS GOING TO SAY... PLEASE BE CAREFUL. AND IF YOU DO THINK OF ANYTHING, I HOPE YOU'LL TAKE ME INTO YOUR CONFIDENCE THIS TIME. [DOOR OPENS] THE LAB BOYS TURNED IT UP AS ARSENIC-- IN THE CURRY. NOT A LOT. JUST ENOUGH FOR STOMACHACHES ALL THE WAY AROUND. NOT ENOUGH TO KILL. SO ALBERT MUST HAVE HAD AN EXTRA DOSE. YES, BUT WHY POISON THE OTHERS AT ALL? IF THE POISONER IS A MEMBER OF THE FAMILY, HE HAD TO BE ILL AS WELL. WELL, SAY IT ISN'T, SIR. I MEAN, THAT GARDENER OF THEIRS, HILLMAN-- THERE'S TALK IN THE LOCAL PUB THAT HE'S IN FOR A NICE LITTLE BEQUESTMENT, OLD ACKENTHORPE GOES. WELL, IT IS A POSSIBILITY, SIR. FORGETTING THE DEAD WOMAN, BACON. THIS POISONING MAKES IT PRETTY CERTAIN TO ME THAT SHE WAS MARTINE ACKENTHORPE. OH? FRENCH POLICE COME UP WITH SOMETHING, THEN? ONLY THAT THERE'S NO RECORD OF A MARRIAGE. THE VILLAGE WHERE EDMUND ACKENTHORPE WAS STATIONED WAS BLOWN TO BITS DURING THE WAR. ALL THE FILES IN THE TOWN HALL DESTROYED. WELL, THEN, SIR? DON'T YOU SEE, BACON? IT'S THE PATTERN OF THE KILLINGS. ONLY A MEMBER OF THE FAMILY WOULD WANT TO GET RID OF HER, TOO. YES. KILL OFF ALL YOUR RELATIONS IN EASY STAGES, EXCEPT THE OLD MAN. WHEN HE DIES A NATURAL DEATH, INHERIT THE ENTIRE FORTUNE AS WELL AS THE PROPERTY. ALBERT MUST HAVE GOT HIS SECOND DOSE AFTER DINNER, POSSIBLY IN A DRINK. I SHOULDN'T DRINK THAT. WHY NOT? BECAUSE IT'S LUNCHTIME. OH. WHAT IS IT? BEEF BROTH, BAKED CUSTARD. BEEF BROTH? BUT I ORDERED BEEFSTEAK! THE DOCTOR SAID BEEF BROTH. WELL, TO THE BLAZES WITH HIM! I GIVE THE ORDERS IN THIS HOUSE. I'M SICK OF SLOPS. TAKE IT AWAY. CERTAINLY. EGHH... HILLMAN, ANOTHER BOTTLE. SURELY YOU REALIZE THAT IF THE WOMAN WAS MARTINE, BY SHOWING THAT LETTER TO THE POLICE, YOU'VE POINTED THE FINGER AT ONE OF US, NOT ONLY FOR HER DEATH BUT ALBERT'S, TOO. EXACTLY. ONE OF US. I MIGHT HAVE EXPECTED THAT FROM YOU. OH, COME NOW. YOU'RE THINKING ALONG EXACTLY THE SAME LINES AS I AM-- IF YOU DIDN'T DO IT, THAT IS. YOU'RE PROBABLY THINKING IT WAS ME. OH, STOP IT. STOP IT! OR EVEN YOU, DEAR EMMA. LOOK, I THINK WE'VE HAD JUST ABOUT ENOUGH OF THIS NONSENSE. I BET THE POLICE DON'T THINK IT'S NONSENSE. NOW, LISTEN, CEDRIC. SAY WHAT YOU LIKE ABOUT THE REST OF US, BUT PLEASE LEAVE EMMA OUT OF IT. WELL, IT COULD BE ARGUED, YOU KNOW, THAT, UH, EMMA KEPT THAT LETTER TO HERSELF UNTIL SHE COULD USE IT TO HER OWN ADVANTAGE. WHAT? I THINK YOU'D BETTER EXPLAIN THAT. WELL, LET'S FACE IT. THE MOMENT MARTINE'S BODY WAS DISCOVERED, EVERYONE IN THIS FAMILY WAS UNDER SUSPICION, INCLUDING YOU, EMMA, AND THE MOMENT YOU PRODUCED THAT LETTER VOLUNTARILY, EVERYONE WAS UNDER SUSPICION EXCLUDING YOU. HMM. I HADN'T THOUGHT OF IT LIKE THAT. YOU MUST BE ROUND THE BEND. THAT WOMAN WAS STRANGLED. DO YOU THINK YOUR SISTER CAPABLE OF DOING A THING LIKE THAT? OH, BUT EMMA'S AN ATTRACTIVE WOMAN, DON'T YOU THINK SO? WELL? WELL, AN ATTRACTIVE WOMAN DOESN'T NEED TO DO HER OWN DIRTY WORK, DOES SHE? COME ALONG, EMMA. I THINK WE'D BETTER LEAVE THEM TO IT. NOW, NOW, EASTLEY. EMMA HAS HER EYE ON THE GOOD DOCTOR, YOU KNOW. I'M AFRAID IT'S NOT GOING TO BE SO EASY FOR YOU TO MARRY INTO THE FAMILY FOR A SECOND TIME. HO HO. THAT HIT HOME, DIDN'T IT? YES. AND I'M ABOUT READY TO BREAK YOUR BLASTED NECK. VERY POSSIBLY, BUT TELL ME SOMETHING FIRST. DO YOU DENY MEETING EMMA SECRETLY ON THE GROUNDS THE NIGHT BEFORE THE BODY WAS DISCOVERED? WELL, I... HILLMAN SAW YOU, YOU KNOW. ALL RIGHT. WE DID MEET THAT NIGHT, YES. HE ASKED ME TO INTERCEDE WITH FATHER. OH? WHAT FOR? I WANTED TO BORROW MONEY, IF YOU MUST KNOW. TSK, TSK, TSK. OH, MY GOODNESS! WHAT ARE YOU DOING? MAKING UP THE BED. BUT YOU MADE IT UP THIS MORNING. YES, BUT THE PILLOWSLIPS NEED CHANGING. THEY LOOK PERFECTLY ALL RIGHT TO ME. BUT NOT TO ME. OH, WHAT AM I DOING? I DO WISH THAT WOMAN WOULD HURRY UP. THEY KNOW I DON'T LIKE BEING HERE AFTER DARK. WHAT ARE YOU AFEARD OF? SOME MAN WILL GET YOU? YOU KNOW, IT'S FUNNY HOW THINGS ALWAYS COME TOGETHER. MY SISTER'S ELDEST HAD MEASLES, AND THEN HER ERNIE FELL AND BROKE HIS ARM, AND HER HUSBAND COME OUT ALL OVER WITH BOILS, ALL IN THE SAME WEEK. YOU WOULDN'T BELIEVE IT, WOULD YOU? IT'S GOING TO BE THE SAME THING HERE. FIRST THAT NASTY MURDER AND THEN MR. ALBERT POISONED. WHO'S GOING TO BE THE NEXT, I'D LIKE TO KNOW? THINGS ALWAYS GO IN THREES. HERE YOU ARE, MRS. KIDDER. I'M SORRY TO HAVE KEPT YOU, BUT THE DOCTOR HAS BEEN WITH MR. ACKENTHORPE. HMM. LONG WAIT FOR VERY LITTLE. [DOOR SHUTS] THE YOUNGER GENERATION. HMM. WELL, I DON'T KNOW. [DOG BARKS] [DOG BARKS] AAH! [MRS. KIDDER SCREAMS] AAH! WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH YOU? Hillman: IT'S MR. HAROLD. THE POINT IS, DID HE USE THIS ON HIMSELF, OR DID SOMEBODY ELSE PULL THE TRIGGER? WELL, IT'LL ADD UP IF IT WAS SUICIDE. HAROLD KILLED THE OTHER TWO, GOT COLD FEET, AND TOOK WHAT IS LAUGHINGLY CALLED THE EASY WAY OUT. HMM... ALL OF THEM KNEW HE LIKED AN HOUR OR 2 SHOOTING BEFORE DINNER WHENEVER HE WAS AT THE HALL. BUT HE WAS SHOT FROM A RANGE OF ABOUT 2 INCHES. ALL RIGHT. SOMEONE HE KNOWS COMES UP TO HIM, CASUALLY ASKS TO HAVE A LOOK AT THE GUN, AND, UH... [PULLS TRIGGER] STILL COULD HAVE BEEN SUICIDE, THOUGH. IF I WERE THE MURDERER, THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT I'D WANT US TO THINK. ONE THING'S SURE. WE CAN'T RISK ANY MORE KILLINGS. COME ON. WHERE TO, SIR? THE HALL. I'M GOING TO FIND THAT COMPACT IF I HAVE TO TURN THE WHOLE PLACE AND EVERYONE IN IT UPSIDE DOWN. OH, EXCUSE ME, SIR. THERE'S A LADY TO SEE YOU, SIR-- A MISS MARPLE. OH. COME IN. GOOD AFTERNOON, MISS MARPLE. YOU WERE GOING SOMEWHERE? YES. THEN I'LL COME TO THE POINT AT ONCE. [FRERE JACQUES PLAYING] A BEAUTIFUL LITTLE PIECE, ISN'T IT? WHO HAD IT? YOUNG ALEXANDER. WHAT? I SHOULD HAVE REALIZED, OF COURSE. THAT BOY'S INCORRIGIBLE. PLAYING IT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT LIKE THAT--TYPICAL. SO WE'RE BACK WHERE WE STARTED. OH, NO, INSPECTOR. I THINK I KNOW WHO OUR MURDERER IS. THE DIFFICULTY'S GOING TO BE GETTING HIM TO SHOW HIS HAND. SIT DOWN, MISS MARPLE. THANK YOU. [DOG BARKING] OH, HOLD THAT EXPRESSION, EMMA. OH, PITY. YOU SPOILED IT. WHAT'S THE MATTER, DARLING? THINGS NOT WORKING OUT FOR YOU? HOW DO YOU MANAGE TO MAKE EVERYTHING YOU SAY SOUND LIKE AN INSINUATION? [CHUCKLES] HE WORKS AT IT. FOR HEAVEN'S SAKE, STOP FUSSING, QUIMPER. IF I WISH TO COME DOWN, I SHALL DO SO. I THINK THIS CHAIR, HILLMAN. FATHER, DON'T YOU THINK-- NOW, DON'T YOU START! SORRY, EMMA, BUT YOU KNOW WHAT HE'S LIKE WHEN HIS MIND IS MADE UP. I'M NOT GOING TO STAY UP THERE ALL ALONE. MIGHT GET MURDERED IN ME BED. AT LEAST THERE'S SOME SAFETY IN NUMBERS. I QUITE AGREE WITH YOU, FATHER. THAT MAKES A NICE CHANGE. I WANT A DRINK. NO, NOT YOU-- QUIMPER. THEN I MUST BE GOING. DON'T SMOTHER ME WITH IT, MAN! PUT IT ROUND ME KNEES. THIS IS ALL VERY NICE AND COZY. HOW ABOUT A RUBBER OF BRIDGE? WELL, IT WAS JUST A THOUGHT. [FRERE JACQUES PLAYING] WHAT HAVE YOU GOT THERE, BOY? OH, A CHARMING LITTLE THING. FRENCH, SECOND EMPIRE. PRETTY VALUABLE, I'D SAY. Father: WHERE'D YOU GET IT? IT BELONGS TO MISS MARPLE. YOU'D BETTER GIVE IT BACK TO HER, HADN'T YOU? I ONLY BORROWED IT. I'LL DROP IT IN ON MY WAY TO BED. [FRERE JACQUES PLAYING] [FOOTSTEPS] COME IN, DOCTOR. YOU'RE EXPECTING ME? DIDN'T ALEXANDER TELL YOU? TELL ME WHAT? FORGETFUL BOY. I HAVE A SORE THROAT, DOCTOR, AND I ASKED HIM TO ASK YOU TO BE KIND ENOUGH TO HAVE A LOOK AT IT BEFORE YOU LEFT. I SEE. I'M SORRY TO TROUBLE YOU. I HAVEN'T HAD ONE OF THESE THROATS IN YEARS. WELL, YOU'VE BEEN LUCKY, MISS MARPLE. ANY HEADACHES? NO. JUST THE SORE THROAT. MM-HMM. WELL, WE'LL HAVE A LOOK. THIS IS RATHER ATTRACTIVE. YES. ISN'T IT? WHERE DID YOU GET IT? I FOUND IT. OH? WHERE? IN THE STABLES HERE. REALLY? OPEN WIDE, PLEASE. SAY "AHH." AHH. NO INFLAMMATION. DON'T YOU THINK THAT WAS A LITTLE DISHONEST? KEEPING THE COMPACT, I MEAN. UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES, DOCTOR, NO. IS THERE ANY SWELLING? I DON'T THINK SO. [TRAIN WHISTLE BLOWING] I'VE SEEN YOU LIKE THAT ONCE BEFORE, DOCTOR-- YOUR HANDS AT A WOMAN'S THROAT. IT WAS ON A TRAIN, AND YOU WERE STRANGLING HER. THAT'S QUITE AN ALLEGATION. I HAVE A FEW MORE. OH? YOU COME FOR THE COMPACT BECAUSE YOU HAD GIVEN IT TO THAT WOMAN, AND IT MIGHT BE TRACED BACK TO YOU. I THINK SHE WAS YOUR WIFE. DO YOU? YOU KILLED HER AFTER YOU HAD WRITTEN THAT LETTER TO EMMA, SIGNING IT MARTINE ACKENTHORPE. WHY SHOULD I DO THAT? THE MURDER, SO THAT YOU WOULD THEN BE FREE TO MARRY EMMA. THE LETTER, SO THAT PEOPLE WOULD THINK THE DEAD WOMAN WAS MARTINE AND LOOK AMONG THE FAMILY FOR THE KILLER, NEVER AT YOU. [LOCKS DOOR] HOW DID YOU ARRIVE AT THIS FASCINATING HYPOTHESIS? IT WAS I WHO FOUND HER BODY. MARTINE WAS--OR IS, FOR ALL I KNOW-- A NORMANDY PEASANT. THE DEAD WOMAN HAD NEVER WORKED ON A FARM IN HER LIFE. I SAW HER HANDS. GO ON. CERTAINLY. YOU THEN PROCEEDED TO AUGMENT YOUR PROSPECTS BY ELIMINATING ALBERT AND HAROLD. HOW, CONCEIVABLY? YOU CONTRIVED TO INTRODUCE ARSENIC INTO MY CURRY-- WHICH I FIND UNFORGIVABLE, BY THE WAY-- KNOWING THAT YOU WOULD BE CALLED ON TO DEAL WITH THE AFTEREFFECTS. EASY, THEN, TO GIVE ALBERT HIS FINAL DOSE IN THE MEDICINE. AND HAROLD? YOU SHOT HIM AND MADE IT LOOK LIKE SUICIDE. INGENIOUS, I MUST ADMIT. MORE THAN THAT. NOW THAT YOU ARE HERE TO SECURE YOUR DEAD WIFE'S COMPACT, A FAIR CASE. YES. A PITY YOU WON'T BE ABLE TO PRESENT IT. ONE MORE MURDER, DOCTOR, MIGHT BE ONE TOO MANY. THIS WON'T LOOK LIKE MURDER, MISS MARPLE. THE DEATH CERTIFICATE-- SIGNED BY ME, OF COURSE-- WILL REGISTER HEART FAILURE. [GASPS] YOU ALL RIGHT? YES, THANK YOU. YOU'RE UNDER ARREST, AND I MUST WARN YOU-- THAT EVERYTHING I'VE SAID HAS BEEN TAKEN DOWN AND WILL BE USED IN EVIDENCE. YOU WERE RIGHT ABOUT EVERYTHING, OF COURSE. YOU'RE A VERY BRAVE WOMAN, MISS MARPLE. GOOD NIGHT. OHH! ABOUT TIME, TOO. I WAS COMING UP TO SEE YOU, YOU KNOW, BEFORE LEAVING. NO NEED TO LEAVE. I HAVE MY OWN HOME, MR. ACKENTHORPE. SELL IT. WHY ON EARTH SHOULD I? WELL, TAKING ONE THING AND ANOTHER... I MEAN, UH... YOU'RE A FAIR COOK, AND, UH... YOU SEEM TO HAVE YOUR WITS ABOUT YOU, AND, UH... WELL... I'VE DECIDED TO MARRY YOU. WELL? WELL, I'M HONORED, OF COURSE. OF COURSE YOU ARE, BUT COME TO THE POINT. I'M AFRAID THAT CANNOT BE. WHY? WELL, IF EVER I DO EMBARK ON SUCH A VENTURE, THERE IS SOMEONE ELSE. NONSENSE. I DON'T BELIEVE IT. WHO ON EARTH WOULD HAVE YOU? APPARENTLY YOU, FOR ONE, MR. ACKENTHORPE. GOOD-BYE. THE WOMAN MUST BE COMPLETELY UNBALANCED. OH, MISS MARPLE, I... I'M SO GLAD-- HOW GOOD OF YOU TO COME. LET ME GIVE YOU A HAND. THANK YOU. HA HA HA!
