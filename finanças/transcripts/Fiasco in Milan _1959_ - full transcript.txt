FIASCO IN MILAN The same unknown band steals pasta and chickpeas with the hole method... What does he want? Tie '! Good morning. Got mail? The administrator came for the rent. Yes, when I go out. Once "When I go out," another "When I come back"! Hello! I'm sorry if I allowed myself... Brigadier, I am an honest worker ! Look, blisters! If I was a brigadier, maybe you should have been able to escape from me. I wanted to see how you were living. Not bad.. But another time choose a cheaper double-door. - Do not you trust? - Should I trust one that comes with the break-in? - Cigarette? - No. - But is a Swiss one! - You do 'well, while I speak. - But you look... These are times of little satisfaction. The serious profession is in crisis. Instead you and your friends have done a good job. But the organizational deficiency always give you the capital. How do I have to say ?! I know nothing! I'm a friend of Dante Cruciani the one who taught you to "work" the safe. - Ask him about the "Milanese". - So? I came from Milan to propose a job well paid. Listen to me: ... if before I made a mistake with the door, this time you are wrong. This is the home of a man who has given a clean slate of the past. Now he lives of his honest work, clear? Work on the building site are finished and you're unemployed. What if it is so? That's not my job. I make the boxer, I took contacts for a "comeback"! - I'll wait for tomorrow at 07:00 to Niagara Bar. - Wait and hope! Tomorrow I will make the checkup of reactions ps... ps... - You Called me? - Psychophysical! I have a call! - Best wishes! - You'll see! A formality and Baiocchi Giuseppe, said "Pantera", returns to the ring. Ouch! Yes, yes, turn, turn... - I am a lion, doctor! - Stop! Perfect shape! Va 'toward that wall, arms raised and eyes closed. There is one that is waiting for you from half of hour. What happened to you? What do you care, think for yourself! - Hello. - Don't start behave as the Romans(from Rome). First rule, punctuality, clear?. The clock has stopped. "Boy"! - But you do not have the clock! -The tram's clock. - A Campari. - To me "the usual." My treat. The mister has already payed . I paid all your arrears and a notebook. - What notebook? - The one where were marked the arrears. - You know Milan? - Well... I have never been there. - Better! - Here is the Campari and "the usual"! Bravo! It's milk. I have to stay sober because a whiskey poisoning. Let's begin all in order.. Every Sunday a car carrying the money from Totocalcio office of Milan to the Bank of Labor. You have to lock the car, on which there is a guy who agrees with me and he will let take away the suitcase with money. - I see... Excuse me. - All arranged. I take a half, the rest your men. But they must be smart! Natural. In Milan I I have many, but they aren't good, they are too "famous". Of course. - You know some men? - Of course! I have the best! "You thought to cheat me?" Come! Look out! If we see the masked man, I will be dismissed, I am provisionally ! - It begun from long time? - Silence! - Did you find work? I shot in vain all day. But the engagement party will take place the same. So spending increases. You have to regularize the situation with my sister otherwise what will the people think when they see you knocking at our door? They will think I am a "beggar". You never let me in! When you will bethroth Carmela you will stay near her freely. I betroth her! - Lay off that! - I fasted for three days! What a ceremony! They are just beautiful and go well together! - But we're engaged! - You will be after the wedding! There are coming our relatives! Happy Birthday, returns of the day! - Gifts! -I am obliged! - Duty mine! Have you invited them? I couldn't say no, they would have be offended, if I didn't invited them! Go! It cost me 600 pounds! A flower? No, the fine for having trampled the flower beds! - Thank tou very much! - I bought it! You take away the jacket if you want, it's hot. Very kind of you. - A moment... You never know. - You do not trust us? My sister musn't know about our past activities! We met in doctrine (religious hours)! - Excuse me! Pay attention! - Put on again your jacket! - With best wishes! - Who invited you ?! - Who would have thought? Between the two of you almost ended with a knife... This is it! The sister is as beautiful, as ugly is the brother. Put this in the refrigerator, after we make a toast. I am obliged. Good. - Carmela made them. No, I made them with my hands! - So, we drink ?! - A toast to the last amnesty? There's too much noise, let's leave this place. How long did it take you to make this kit? I began it in 1942, at the age of 4 years! - You don't shut the door? - No, I used it as a table for refreshments. So... Working goes bad, right? - How do you know? - How do I know? I know you can not even pay the priest that must marry you. But I'm getting married, while your fiancee leaved you because you're so poor. - Who told you that? - There are rumors. - I don't admit it. In fact, let's face it. And with this? All we have a tendency to have a stable job. But not just the desire to work. "Spit out the bone". There is a guy... This guy came specially from Milan to propose a "movement". But a "movement" with the alibi, all calculated. All sc-scientific! You have to stop it with this sc-sc-scientific! Hey, "cenciosetto", I say "peop..." to all three! But think a bit ', I offer him a lots of money and he is sarcastic! - How much? - There will be 4 million for every skull! Are you sure? The guests are waiting for the toast! We come. - Someone stole the light bulb from the WC - Forget it. After the guys had reached the agreement it was necessary an engine specialist... Since this time the scenario is all motorized we need a car specialist. One that transforms and "makes-up", you understand? This mechanic is an artist! Turn a Topolino(Fiat 500) in a truck and a truck in a motorcycle! It's good, but if he starts talking of his troubles, he will not stop. The wife separated from him and lives with a certain Alfredo, a bookseller. They contend the son, one day is with him and one day with her. What did they put it? A horse of Friesland? We are on the border! Move! Here it is! Your father didn't tell you there it was? Dominic, what do you want for that? 50! I give you 30! Put it in Papa's bag. It's an Aprilia? It's a Ardea, you see, it is smaller! The Aprilia has the ass... backside as "bream". Shut up! Stop! You see it? Wow! If we had brought the gun! - It was a lark? - A quail. - So small? - Is not so small. The Ardea is smaller than the Aprilia the same as the lark is smaller than a quail. You must remember that the quail is as big as the Aprilia. Alfredo says that birds are good and we must't shoot them. Alfredo says that the owl is bad. As Alfredo, who is also stupid. - They are seeking you. - Who? - Gentlemen of passage. - Ugo Nardi, engine wizard! - Fortunato. - Pleasure. - Hey, look at those eyes! - He took them from his father. - What beautiful hair! - He took it from his father. - This bump? - An escarpment. - His mother beated him. 'Go play. That "bitch" before wanted to take him away from me and then beated him! - Maybe you don't know the situation with my wife. - I know it. It has become a fairy tale! You know with who lives my mother-in-law? - With who? - With me! My wife has left her to me, but if I had the money for the lawyer... It is enough 4 "Bonaventure"? Or should I go to the "Roman Rota". - Four what? - Four millions. - Clara, wretch! - Today the boy is with me! Let him here! I write down all of it for the process! I'll show you! Guys, scratch yourselves, that one brings bad luck! It's coming! Power! Ugo Nardi, engine wizard. Pleasure. This is A-Angeletti Mario. This is... Capannelle. In appearance looks badly. But behind his forehead he lurks intelligence of the fox. This is Ferribotte, said "The Silent", because he is laconic. But when he speaks, every word is a judgment. There is beer, help yourself as well. - Who drinks beer lives a hundred years. - Here it is. Here it's hot, but it's a boarding house where we are not asked too many questions. Everyone "holds his tongue behind his teeth." You already know what it is about. But ignore the reason the accountant of Totocalcio agrees with me. A woman is implied. As the saying goes: ... "The woman, even the little one, surpasses the devil's mischief". She is the cause that the accountant no longer reasons. However! No... - It's my half-cousin. - Cousin for real! - I present her to you. She has a voice in the matter, right? - Clear. It is there that takes the naked sun. She doesn' t catch cold, poor thing? Wow, it's so warm outside! - You must not see. - Hey! - Floriana! - Yes? - Come and greet these friends. - Immediately. You two, come back here! On, go back inside! - It's a fine girl! - Move. It seems that you never... - The wind blows? - Thank God! Where are the cigarettes ? - Give us an explanation, it is Peppe was inaccurate. - Inaccurate me ?! That Sunday you will go to Milan with a train full of fans to see Milan-Rome, the second day of the championship. To tell the truth,I am a fan of Palermo. - What does it matter? You don't go for the match. - Kids. But excuse me, the "thing"... The alibi where he is? Where is the excuse? The alibi is the fact that you will return to Rome with the train of fans which has left Milan while you were doing the shot! How? - It's a magic trick? - We are "enchanted" ?! The only "enchanted thing" will be the engine prepared by Nardi. - So? - No, no, I follow! With that engine you'll have to reach the train to Bologna in 1 hour and 50! Only with one engine? What I do? I mount him in Capannelle ?! Who gives me the car, scuse me? - Buy a second hand car , I will take care. - Sorry, but... can it be possible to look upon the place?? - Right! - No need! - What purpose does it serve? That's all that interests you Milan: plans, maps, floor plans! It's all perfectly organized by me and Amedeo, the accountant! Here are the marked paths that you will follow. My dear, here, look there where there... - It is very clear. - It is very clear this way. So the job is easier than the Game of the Goose, true, Floriana? I've never really learned that game, for me it's too difficult. All sundays the car of Totocalcio leaves from the site and always makes this route towards the Via Ferrante Aporti tunnel. You are waiting at the other entrance with the truck. When the car of Totocalcio arrives, the truck makes a turn in the wrong direction! It's a very simple thing, Indoor, there will be no traffic! You say to the accountant to leave "the pray" and he will obey. - Floriana, am I right? - Si! But you have to say everything in the Milanese dialect. Any of you know it? Once I was in Bergamo for a tournament. Let's hear! "Hey, Berga and Berga hotta hora" Sounds good? There is, no? I put him in your hands, give him a couple of little lesson. Okay. Come to me in the morning, around noon. No, I have to write a letter. Come at 7 pm. The accountant understands only the Milanese? It's not an idiot like you. Stop. "I'm stupid, I'm happy, it's more stupid who tells me this." We need the phrase in Milanese dialect because.. It's cute! We need the frase because, if someone hears you, he won't think that you are Roman! Yeah. It is part of the alibi! It's the train from Pescara of 11:55! Soon they will electrify, so I will have a higher rent. Who it was?!Asshole! - It's over the gasoline. - How much did you put it? Five liters, but the carburetors are too many. The engine is fine, but when we shall steal we shall be seen by everybody? Already I thought of that! -Holy Madonna! - "My God"! - Dracula the vampire. - Maybe it's better than before. - it is more human. With this sock not even your mom will recognize you! Who is it? - Fresh beer for everyone! - My God! Changed the appearance, right? So, let's recap. On the truck, Peppe and Mario, on this, Amaro . The third car will be guided by him or by Capannelle? Pilots co... consumed both. The best is Ferribotte. - Wretch! - Poor one! You're hurt? And you are the best!? I told you: "Foot on the brake"! - I've put it! That is the accelerator, the brake is in the center! - Ouch! - Where's your leg that I kick! - We'll eat bread and land! - That one will hit us! Accelerate! Easy, there is the sidewalk! Foot on the brake, gently. - Clutch, if not you turn off the engine. Take off the stick. - I can't. - That is the lever of the arrows! - Why have we stopped? Wait here. - It's not your turn! - Sunday I have to go hunting with friends. And then I'm your father, do you want to put me the counter ?! You don't take me hunting with you? - That's a big hunt, wwith wolves! - What do you read? - A book on life of insects. Learn to kill them, the kitchen is full of cockroaches! Give me the wheel, I'll drive. Let's try it again. "Hands top, give me your suitcase, come on!" I understood only "suitcase". It's very difficult with the dialect and your speaking without the 'R" I don't want to be indiscreet, but how come you miss the "R"? -Have I offended you ? - No, no. It was because a bomb. I was four years old and until then I didn't use the "R" . I had a shock and after that I didn't learn it anymore.. - After all it is barely observable. Me too, I don't know if you notice. but often I stutter. Especially when I'm close to a beautiful young lady. What do you want, when the sun sets... I do not know how to say, I feel alone. My fragile existence is invaded by a deep nostalgia. You haven't a girfriend? I had it, but she escaped. "Woman is like the chestnut: beautiful outside, but inside it has the flaw." Present company excluded. She said that I hadn't a position. But not even the uncensored ones have a stable job ! The social position, damn it! But it does not end this way! After the coup I buy a car 15 meters long and I shall walk below her home in Pieve di Cadore in white tuxedo! - I make her burst of envy! - I also change my life. Amedeo told me that when we will have our share of money he will take me in Venezuela or in "Mechico". - The "X" is also missing"? - The name is pronounced this way! It's the only place where you can get married without divorcing. He is married? Yes, with a wicked and evil woman that haunts him! Give me, I do it. Damn... Okay , we smoke later. Now you are employed? Yes. Where? Dancing Arizona Strip. - What? - Striptease! Turn arround. Come on, we try again. "Hands up, give me the suitcase, come on!" Hands up, "give me the suitcase"... "suitcase"... "Moves"... "Muves"... - We can not change the word? - It's so easy! - it is not. Follow the movements of my lips. - This way you will never learn. - I help you. Stop it, you ruin my shirt! - How is this strip? - Stop it! Make me see a little piece! It's drivel! And without music it is useless! Amedeo is also a poet, he wrote the lyrics. - It is not nice? - Damn! - Give me my shirt, come on! Damn it... Try to sing a little! - I love Amedeo. - Certainly, God forbid. You are sympathetic because you understand me. I met Amedeo in a cafe with TV. He wanted to watch the transmission and after that commit suicide. - It was Cinelandia? - Instead we went to get ice cream. Better, no? He nutty, I strawberry, chocolate and cream. Miss, a call from Milan! Damn it, where are you going? Come back here! Are you, honey? Of course, I think of you! I was just talking about you! Quiet, I leave immediately and tonight I will be up to you. It's all arranged. We hired five elements trusted, true gentlemen! Yes, hello, love! - Change plate! - Done! Please try again... Great! - Well, smart! - What did I tell you? Modestly, I chose them myself. Ouch! Tickets for the train tomorrow, go and return, departure hour: 13:25. - I keep it? - Tickets. - All right. 10,000 "svanziche" a skull! Silk Stockings for face! A watch for everyone, branded stuff. Time signal! Be ', of course, have the means... Rich city... Anyhow,we are the inteligent ones. No... - There's something else. - See? - This one is to hold off the driver. - Who should use it? - You and Peppe. - There is also to shoot ?! The next time you come to me to propose a peaceful work... - Do not make me nervous! - I do it instead! - Enough! - If I catch you... - Stop it! Mario must get married! I ask the honor to take his place in this hold-up! I have good background, I worked with Ammandino of Macerata, you don't know me? This has nothing to do with it, is another thing! Do you want to be my nanny ?! I'm on! This gun does not have the hammer, it's not a real one! It's just for scaring the people! Your job is the most delicate! Come here too! This is your car is here. Your are here. You must create confusion, starting together, you on one side... Where's your car? - Here. And you on the other. With the matches box? The car I gave it to the child, if not he wanted to return at the wreched one. He makes allusion at the child's mother. - Yes. -Stop these stories! We want to work seriously ? - I understood! The "wretched one"! - See, lawyer,should I leave the child here? But why, we were doing... an experts report for an accident. We are the insurance technicians. Dr. Martini, Rossi... - Carpano! -Please, come, lawyer! - Lady, I really was here to settle.. Settle what!? - Who was that? - The legal counsel. What? Carletto, run! - Come with mama! - Stop! - I denounce you for stealing the child! What stealing! Sunday I have a commitment, so I anticipated! - You do not anticipate anything! - I anticipate! - Are not you ashamed ?! - Why do not we do the rounds for your mother? God help me! I'm staying with my son in law! - We are not married, we can leave one another immediately! I will never abandon you! And I will not return to live with my daughter! I'm a Catholic,I don't like her life-style! His life is better? He is in company of four slobs! You also offend?! I sign everything for the process! Have you heard ?! She said "slobs"! - (She is right) ... - No, I sign it to me! Four slobs! And with me, five! Why should you not believe? I'll read the letter. "Dear Mr. Mario..." "... since you have sent us 300 lids of chinotto 'Sport" ..." "...we sent you two tickets for Milan for the match Milan-Rome." "Sincerely." Here, read. - How funny! I can not read! - I have forgot it. You pay the journey with the money, but here they cut off the light or the gas! What are you doing, is the notification for the eviction! Yeah... But maybe we 've done it. We take with us the coffee pot? In Milan they do an inadequate coffee. - Where are you going ?! - You've torn the button! I can not even talk to her? We're engaged! Warning, do not try "to make bread crumbs." Carmela, it came off a button. Have I offended you? I really didn't remember that you have not been to school. It's my fault? We are country people, the school was 20 km. - Only the boys were going. - Why? The women don't use the bicycle, it's ugly. But I learned to make "puppets". - What "puppets" ?! - The "puppets" drawn with the pencil for embroidery. What did you understand? You would like to have real "puppets" and our little house? How could you have it? By winning the football pools? Who knows, it may be. - Look, Mario... Are you crazy? -She was sewing the button. I rip you off an ear, you, liar! You are a coward, it's true, you are a traitor! At the match with the female stockings in his pocket! And yo are covering him! Both of you are two pigs! Have you seen? She misunderstood it. Tell her for whom were those stockings. It was a surprise for you. I was tired to see you with those nun stockings. And you would let me wear silk stockings? Now we are making progresses... - Thank you, Mario! Do not exaggerate with this intimacy! Hey... - Come on, scream! - Go Rome! Look who's here! Stupid, we do not know each other, shut up! So why you hit me ?! AFTER EIGHT HOURS, AT MILAN STATION... Always "Go Rome" Hey! I will send the car to pick you. Everything as planned. Everything arranged. Wait it there. What have I done ?! Explain yourselves! It's for wallet stolen from a Swiss tourist on the Milan-Rome train. Commissioner, there is an error! I did nothing! - I swear on my family! - Move! -I have lost my shoe. -Get on! - It's a shoe Di Varese! - Do not make a fuss! - What manners! You have forgotten that tomorrow Ugo comes with the car ?! We want to throw a gold mine or continue to fight ?! Is there a rapid train to Rome at 23:45, however, we have to pay the supplement. - Have patience... - There's another one... My mother had to drown me, so I didn't have to know you. Don't say that to me. I'm tired! I can't resist with this nasty life! Since I was born, I ate more gall than soup! - How can I express muself ?! It's all prepared, sc... - Scientific! We also have released ourself from the exploiter! That is he would have take the bigger part and would have left us the crumbs! - A talented thief gets caught for a wallet?! Precisely for this. Do you believe he invented the "movement"? There's the accountant. Believe me, you will not regret! You have understood? Who among you knows Milan? - I've been in the army here. - At the time of the "Five Days of Milan" (1848)! - Where is this accountant? You believe I am a dead dogfish like you? I was not born yesterday! You have forgotten about Floriana? She is the brain of the gang! Good evening. The gentlemen have booked a table? Silence! The gentlemen want to sit ?! Here, if you wanna you must pay! It is not an amusement park! The Spanish on the scene! Come on, Pedro and Carmen! We are ready since half an hour! Hurry! Floriana! - What are you doing here ?! - Pull up! - They arrested the Milanese! - Just got off the train! - Damn, he got caught! Goodbye Money! - We thought... Do you know that I lent my cousin 100,000 lire for this deal ?! - It was your money? Yes, and I want to do anyhow the deal! She's right. - Okay,but how we manange with the accountant ? Leave it to me. Now he comes to pick me and I'll explain everything to him. You follow us but hide yourselves. Why? It is very prudent, he wants to have contact only with me. - Wait a minute that I dress. - Go ahead. Hello, kitty, how are you? I'm nervous,who knows how it goes tomorrow. It's going to be ok. The horoscope says: "happy day, long journey ahead." I remember the day before the exams! My wife dyed her hair and came bad, all yellow! She says it's my fault, because I don't give her the money to go to the hairdresser! Don't get sad, soon it will be over. In four we may be seen, you two wait for us in the square... - What square is in Milan? - I do not know. In my time there was the Piazza del Duomo. (they are already there) If there is still, we will meet there. Let's go. Do not let him do as usual: he eats in a restaurant and does not pay. Let's go. These Romans, what people! They are good only to charge taxes to us that we maintain them! Luckily there is your cousin Virgil! He's a good one! - Doesn't he? - Sure, but I must tell you one thing. I guessed him right away: is a right person, smart! If it was not for him, I didn't accept. Do you want a mint? No? I do. I can't even smoke! I got the ulcer because of the stress! Look how many stars! Choose the one that will bring us luck! The one on the right of the Ursa Major. - The Lover' star, near that sort of handle. - Yes. - You like it? - Yes. - I give it to you. - Thank you. It takes us far away! In South America: Honduras, Nicaragua, Mexico! - "Mechico"! You asked about those Latin American orchestra? They are all from Gallarate. The drummer is from Codogno. These two men are following us. - Five! - Six! - Three! - Eight! No, they are two tramps. I have a fear! I will not sleep tonight either! Take a sleeping pill. "Seven hours sleep a body, eight hours sleep a pig." "Nine a spinster ,ten a beautiful woman." I sleep 10 hours! - One! - Three! - S... - Goodbye! - Remember: be strong, the future is ours! - Yes. It's done, Amedeo agrees on everything. He doesn't care about my cousin. Thank goodness. Let's go. - What, it doesn't like you ?! - No, dear, that's great. THE NEXT MORNING CAME "BITTER FOOT"... Boys, I'm relaxed, I have the perfect alibi . I am chasing at Magliana with Mimmo and Vincenzo "Caciotta". I recommend them! Yesterday I was gone to bed at 9:00. All have seen me. At 9:10 I was already driving, and here I am. Be careful, I summarize everything. "Bitter Foot", you wait for the money car in front of the "Toto". Soon as it leaves, you go before the car go to the tunnel entrance, and make a signal to us, that we are here waiting and stop on the corner. Bitter Foot, you held right and stop here. Stay here and wait! With the engine running! Yes, the Gasoline is for free, right? - Ferribotte, listen. - Command, sir. As soon as you hear a bang, start the car and go slow. When I climb with the loot, go in that direction. Mario jumps on this and go in this direction. I've been clear? - Yes... - I do not do anything? I'm the eldest! - Why did we bring this one for? - Fuck it... Ok,you do the pole for Ferribotte who must steal the second car. You do the same also when the car of Totocalcio arrives. You will take off your hat. Instead Mario and I try to remedy the truck. Come on, let's try to escape. Come on, Ugo. It's a good start! I spent a sleepless night. Come on, do not sleep. The next tunnel go right and you are safe! Accelerate! Hey, are you crazy? This is not a garage. Think at what happens later! Go, Bitter Foot! I would give you a foot in the snout! It's written here! Come on let's go! Hey, rascal! Wretch! Look out! Here, some more and there we are! - Hey, thief! - wretch! - Stop! The 17:51! Bitter Foot is already waiting in front of the football pools! ... 78, 79, and 80 million. I'm 80. Accountant, are you sleeping? - you want to count it, please? - Yes. -There are 80. - Accountant, I'm out here with the car. - Thank you. Are you taking it at the manager? - I'll handle that. Hurry up if not , the bank complains! - That's my jacket! - Excuse me, they are alike. Give it to me. Here you can not stand, the parking is forbidden! I took a shot sleep and I wanted to rest a bit '. I go away immediately, thank you! - But it's on the sidewalk ?! - I forgot the steering lock! "Ladro di treno arrested in the railway station." Instead of the tunnel, why don't we overpass? It is longer. - But we avoid three traffic lights! Here! It has become worse than in Naples! "Who leaves the old road to the new doesn't know what he finds." You should know, being a poet. Hey, hands up... "Give me the suitcase"... Mu... mu... mu... 18.04. St..-Start the engine! Engine started! - The silk stockings! - Ah, I didn't tell you. What? - I forgot them, I took two handkerchiefs. Damn it... Pure filthy! There we are! One, two, three, four, five, s... s... - You! - No, ten! - Go! - The engine don't start! The handbrake! Go! No! What a blow! "Damn the filthy"! - Who gave you the license ?! - Run away! Why should ?It's not my fault! And then both of them are wounded! - It's a trick, they are robbers! - I bring you to the hospital! "Damn the filthy"! you have ruined me! - Accountant, come here! -Come here, - Accountant, what are you doing?!- Please, stop! Come back! - Take me to the police station! - Yes, sir, right away! - What a mess! Run! - Mamma mia, they have ruined me ! Have you seen? It's not my fault! They have cut off the road! But where do you take me ?! What do you want?! Who are you ?! - This comes from where ?! - I caught him on the fly! Take the money but have mercy on me! But who touches you ?! - Hit me, don't leave me like this! - Peppe hit him, you are a boxer! - Peppe! - You left him there ?! - I? - We've lost the chief! - My mother! - It's empty ?! - Empty ?! - Madonna holy! - My God! - How many will they be? - 80 million. But beat me, please! - Shut up! - I have family! - Why do you care?! Beat me, if not they arrest me! I'm ruined! Soon, surely they have already warned the police! - I'm ruined! - Who cares! -Bitter Foot, at the steering wheel! At the at the steering wheel! At the wheel! Bitter Foot, at the wheel! Beat me, or will denounce you, I will say that we agreed! My God, what a knock! Yes, sir, 1100 Black! I got it! Yes, sir! Pellagatta, a robbery! 1100 black license plate of Milano! It's has passed one now! - They chase us ?! - No, no... - Damn! Guys, get ready! - I'm in alert, but I don't see! - we have to find the place! Slow down! Turn there to the left! Hurry up! Do not delay! Hurry! Bitter foot! - Get! - I got my nails... Soon, they're coming! Come on come on! Hurry! Quick, go inside! Hurry! Inside! - Hey, the license plate! - The license plate! The plate is changed! Slow down a bit '! Go! I hope I have not hurt the accountant. What do you care ?! Better think at Peppe! The train for Rome has left from 8 minutes. Peppe took it surely. Ugo, accelerate, we must get to Bologna! Hey, but that one sleeps on the seat! Alarm, Bitter Foot! - What... - Whisk inside the additional carburators! Talk to me, if not I shall sleep. Talk, sing! Tua, only your... Fuck your grandfather! Bitter Foot, three minutes! The traffic light! Which traffic light? - Good evening! This one will not make it to return to Rome alone! Just take us to the station of Bologna! Hurry up,the train is leaving! Run! I always run to empty stomach, do not eat ever! It was good the sandwich we have ate at the station bar? - Which sandwich ?! Meantime, in Milan... - Who is it? - It's me... - You fell on the ground ?! - My God... Why aren't you with your friends? What happened to you?! My mother... What a mess! Peppe! What are you doing ?! You're in my house, in Milan! - Sit here! - Let me sit ... and do not let me fall. - There, there... - The bed... - Why are you still in Milan ?! They left me alone, those four bastards! Hey, take my hand from under! I ran away... Holy Mother how much I ran... I slipped into discharge of garbage of a building. What customs! They threw all the garbage on me! Holy Mother, how filthy! I was there five hours, with cockroaches and rats! What a day! What happened? What did say on the radio? - Amedeo's in the hospital. - Why? - I saw him, he has something big here. He told me: "Go away, you coward! I just love my wife." - It seemed crazy! - Why has he a "bump"? They were your friends, when they were taking the suitcase with 80 millions. Poor guy... 80 million ?! Then they made it! Of course, imagine! I had arranged everything so well that it worked without me, too. Floriana! We're riding! We are rich! Hey... My back! We have a mountain of bills with Dante's profile! You reek of garbage! The Floriana prepares you a nice bath! You'll get the suitcase? - No, no! But where will he be? I have traveled all over the train, Peppe it isn't here! We thought it was spun around smooth! Maybe they arrested him! They arrest all of us! I don't go with that suitcase! For now, let's put it in the luggage storage. - Brilliant idea. - Yes, yes. "The savage aggression in Ferrante Aporti street." "An award for the Toto accountant wounded by robbers." Here he is, the hero, the victim of duty! That filthy one! They have even given him a prize! What you care? Thank "Holy Babe"that he has not spoken! - I'm afraid of Peppe! Where is he? - The newspaper does not say anything. Yes, you imagine that if they are squeezing him they come to tell you! Peppe does not speak, is strong and fearless. Have you seen him in the ring? The minute he fell down to ground he does not get up anymore. That one speaks, I tell you! He denounces us all! - What can you do. Open! Police! Oh! Via, guys! Fuck you! - Wretch! - Dishonest and stinking! - Imbecile! - You took the "spaghetti", right? What carrion! Come forward, "Zebrona"! - Hi, guys! - Look, Capannelle is sick! You don't have to do these jokes! I am fasting from Sunday! Now, now! - Hurray! - Cheers! This wine made of must, to the health of our Peppe! With these big glasses, to the health of our millions! Thank goodness! With this good wine and up, to the health of this ticket! - We go to the station... - To take our suitcase! - Watch your receipt! - Ale! Your! Tomorrow I go to the lawyers syndicate, I take the best. "You want a million? Two? Just we destroy the bitch!" - How long does it? - How does 80 million divided by 6? The 6. in 80 , There is place for many 6! - Once the surplus of 2. - The second place it here. - No, there! - Exactly! There is nothing, not talk about it anymore. Now they are all convinced that the robbers are already in Switzerland. "Khrushchev holds out his hand and winks." "Bibi is expecting a baby." What the hell does that mean? "They are Roman not Milanese." "Speech of Mr Moro." "Increase of prices." Hey, "They are Roman not Milanese" You read below ?! "The driver of Totocalcio declares that he heard to utter..." "... the following oath: 'God damn the filthy'..." "... from one of the attackers, a tall, dark, clean-shaven." - "Investigations moving into Capital." - We're screwed! Look at this! How good I am. So... That's it. Look at me! I'm fine? I think... - Shut up! - Who is? - Friends. - Enter. Why change voice? - And why have you changed yours ?! Here we go from bad to worse! A witness said that there was a thief with pants of cavalier! - I have only these! - Of course, you go around like that! - You look Rugantino! Be serious! - These are sport pants! Wait, come here! Put these on and then disappear, they must not see us together! Hey! Did you understand? They have never seen together! Prudence! Fuck it! - There's a hole, I go around with them? - If they were new, I should have gave them to you? Walk! Can you cook only eggs? Wow, that a cook you are! Forget the cooking... your mission in life is another. - Michael, it's ready! - Immediately! It is a light sauce: garlic, sausage, peppers, sardines. - What did you do? - A more lively hairdo. - You are lively, I see both of you gloomy. -Gloomy? What "gloomy"? - Who is? - Police! It's a friend who likes to make jokes. Peppe, do not be silly! Nicosia Michele! There is also Angeletti Mario, we spared a trip! - What have I done ?! - Follow us in the Commissariat. - Do not push! - Carmela, don't worry, it will be solved. I did apply for a fishing license! - I am a citizen, I did not do anything! - Walk! What undemocratic abuse of power! - Those of Milan robbery? - Room number 7! - What robbery ?! - Walk! - Damn... - Hello, we're all here. - Every heinous crime summon all. The press talk about everything except amnesty! - They do give a damn! - They're careful! - D-Did you go out? - Yes. - Now returns. - Why you care? - You'll see. How did it go? Is going badly. Released, but available. Be ', but... Damn... They called all except Foot Amaro. - What the "sfanga". - It Capannelle? How did it go? It is interrogated by a Marshal arrived from Milan. Hey! So? What are you looking? Do your business! Mario... Thanks. At your age, go to Milan for a match? I've always been an athlete. You'd be the one who always come to pubs eat always and then you go away without paying. - You have 11 convictions for this. - Roughly. But you found the money to go to Milan. Exactly, Mr. Marshal, I found them on the ground, in an envelope. - For now you can go. - Thank you! A lot of health! So, Storti, where were you on Sunday? Ask don Bedoni. I was at the first communion of my granddaughter. You always go to first communions, you are a great believer. I have! You are the one who does not "believe" what I say! Bagliocchi Joseph, former boxer. Sunday I was in Milan because of the game. Go Rome! You are the twelfth offender who were at the game. Excuse me if I would, only 12 out of 1,000 Roma fans it is a paltry percentage of offenders. - Among the Lazio it is greater. - So you were at the game? Of course, sergeant. Look here. Stadium Ticket, ticket train from Rome to Milan. Everything is OK. - Did you see the whole game? - Why, one goes away before? So tell me what happened 41 minutes into the second half. In the 41 minute, Altafini said "Mazzola" received the leather ball from snappy Danova encircled Bernardin and did start a dry lash that insaccavaunited the convergence of the poles. Nothing to do for even vigilant Manetti! Referee? Impartial but irascible arbitrator, Mr. Baralla of Livorno! approximately 75,000 spectators, despite a slight cloud cover but without Giove Pluvio would put into practice his threat. - A beautiful memory. - It's a gift I have ever had. - And the liars also have it. Go! - Thank you! A lot of health! This and other three have preserved stadium and train tickets. They have also witnesses on the train. Isn't it a bit too much? The robbers were seen going to Switzerland. They could not take the train to Rome. I'd keep an eye on them. - Come on, boys! - Your turn. Celioni Otello, innocent! One moment. Bitter Foot , a call for you! Did he tell you who is ?! - Who is it? - Panther Bitter Foot, over and out. - Do not you tell me anything? - Wait... We are under attack! I heard Storti saying he was to the communion of his niece. - No hunting, your alibi collapsed! - How should I? Search quickly an alibi with an uncensurated person , even paying. If you need, sell the car. Step and c-c... - To sell it? To whom, The Pope? -...and close! They have taken away the car, the Milanese had only paid a deposit. Hello? Hello! - Goodbye, lady! - Mamma mia... Bitter foot, the cup! What a madman! Hey, what 's happened? - I need to talk man to man. - What happened? Alfredo, last Sunday I have been with you all day. - What did you do? Don't ask me, I will be asked tomorrow to the police station. - Alfredo, I'm a man, you are a man... - Okay,I understood, we're men. - But why you have come to me? - Because you are uncensured! You're the only uncensored I know in whole Rome. You're honest, you're a man... Here we go again! I have to tell you you're a woman ?! Fuck me! And this where I have taken from? Sunday I was at the Etruscan Museum of Villa Giulia. Do they believe that someone like you go to museums? Why not? Suddenly I've got a craving for education. So I ask you too a favor. Tell me! If I can! It is because of Carletto. What does that have to do with anything?! - Do not panic. Carletto is intelligent, sensitive. It needs to be educated. - You should let him to me every Sunday. Every sunday? I teach them many things, I take him to museums. Now is the exposure of French lace the international exhibition of the dolls... The laces, dolls... But what do we want to become (a gay)? See how material you are? It can grow well with someone like you? However, Ugo, take it or leave it. Tell me the truth. - What? Carletto is my son or... If I were a "filthy" like you, I would leave these doubts to you. In fact, I'd say it's my son, that'll teach you! Now go, I'm busy! Okay, as you wish. Take him to see the laces. It's better than having his father in jail. Ugo, how would it be? Men, men! Men don't behave in this way. Come on, do not cry. I have taken away even a teaspoon. I am innocent! I am innocent, I swear! I am a victim of circumstances! No... no... No, not torture! Carmela, what do you want? "white melon and dark conscience, you turn in bed the whole night." You are so stubborn! It is a error of justice coinciding with the trip. It's all cleared up, I swear! On our mother's ashes? Do not mix the sacred with the profane. I'm your elder brother, and you have to believe me, I am calm ! Where are you going? Is the water tap. Traitor! "More than fear could the fasting" Give me a portion of those onions and these little fishes? Even with these and these! Then give me a portion, rather two, of the "big fish". Then, look... This is perfect! You tuna! Even this and this! Then give me four bananas! - What? - The guards raided your home! - What?! Carmela got scared. What were they searching ?! - What they find? - They could only find the bills of the pawnshop. Carmela! We must warn Peppe, has the receipt of the suitcase! - Yes. - Carmela! Carmela! - Open! A letter! - But she can't write! But she can draw! - Two pigs! We're us! - And the train! - Where she has gone ?! - She wants to throw herself under a train! You run at Peppe, if they are going to him is the end! You go, I'm going to find Carmela! Hey, come on! - This does not go to Sicily! - I want to go home! This is a freight, goes to the stores. - Carmela! - Leave me! - At the mental hospital! - Carmela! Carmela! - Carmela, where are you going ?! - Leave me alone, I want to return in Sicily! - Carmela! - You swore on our mother's ashes. It is false, I didn't swore. So it's true, you are thieves! I impose myself as a brother! Come home instantly! I am an adult! I am 18 years old! So what ?! The female is maggiore from 28 years on! - Marshal, come. - Nothing... There is nothing. - And you? - Anything. -Whose stuff is this? - Of a disgrace. Of an ugly evacuated! Who wants to be with me ?! I'm a worker, a wretch! She does his duty, but I am a wretch! - I know nothing! - OK let's go. Goodbye! A lot of health! I do not know anything! It's gone... - What happened ?! - What a fright! - Did they find anything? - What were they to find? The receipt! The receipt of the suitcase! How come they have not found? Where I put it ?! Peppe, why do not we leave for "Mechico"? You have no ties with anyone. Let's take our bags and go. "Judas the pig"! But where I put it ?! - But what are you looking ?! - The receipt! Fuck it, is in the pants that I gave to Capannelle! - And if he loses? If he get caught ?! - So? - So what? Let's go to "Mechico"! Floriana, do not you understand ?! I hunted! We lost the ticket! They will give me 20 years! And you break "my balls" with "Mechico" ?! Go yourself! Va 'in "Mechico", in Milan! " Go fuck yourself"! Are you crazy? I will hit you! I "learn" to you the education! When I return you have to apologize to me! Yes? Ugly pig, carrion, Southerner, Vigl... Br-r-verything pig, far-r-abutto... Terrone (Southerner).. Torrone(Nougat)! Window! Window! Courtyard! - Prato! Rhubarb! - Enough! - Idiot! Capannelle, open up! There is, he had a heart attack in the stomach, he is at the hospital! Damn, right now? He always stuffed himself with junk! Locust beans, acorns, broccoli... Down! Of course! I told him 12 times to go at hospital! It will have a tribe of tapeworms in the belly! Anything! I have lost 5 pounds these days! He does not give a damn. He thinks at Carmela. You're so stupid to give the pants with the ticket to Capannelle ?! Shut up! - You pick on us? - Forget it! They are the ones who want to talk with 29. Relatives? Thank you, Professor. The relatives are they, the grandchildren. - Is an indigestion? - Yes, but it isn't just that. Your grandfather had a terrible life and the heart has suffered. By now there is little to do. - How come, little to do? - Let a consultation, anything. Do not mind the appearance, the money we find them. Any amounts. It's no use, go and greet him. It's late, but I'll allow it. But not with those faces! But you see... Hey! Cow, what earthquake! You are so low! But you already look good! - This buries us all! - It seems the picture of health! I had been in the hospital years ago, "when I was old." I'm feeling fine . When Sister Angelica comes I present her to you. - She is so funny ! - Be ', thank goodness. Of 'the truth, What did you eat? Mixed aperitifs, agnolotti, tripe, lamb ossobuco, fish soup, fruit salad coffee, liqueur, beans with tuna! Service, bread, cover and wine...7750. Wow! - You've done it again the trick? - So they've denounced you? - No, I paid. - Who gave you the money? I found the receipt in Peppe pants. I could not resist the temptation he took the suitcase and I took 10,000 lire. But... where did you put the suitcase ?! I took it with me. It's under the bed. Oh my God, oh my! Marshal! Who are you? - Silence, Uncle, the doctor said you have to sleep. - I sleep whenever I want. - If you do not sleep, I make you asleep! - That bed there, the 29. - Thanks. - Are you friends? I didn't know- They presented to the Commissioner. It is a courtesy call. So you made another lunch. This time you made a fruitless journey: I paid! That's what why I came. Where did you get those 10,000 lire? I found them! Don't tell me you have found them on the ground because This time I do not believe! I got it, do not bother! - Excuse me. - Thank you. I'm sorry,why can't a citizen like Mr. Capannelle may not have a certain amount? A citizen as mr Capanelle must show me how he has gained it. What if by chance one day he wins the football pools? Yes, but he must show me the coupon. If not, he has made the sum with the football pools, but without making 13. In this case provides the judge: 13 years for armed robbery. So, if in addition to lunch you have something else on your "stomach" send for me, I'm down the hall. One can not even take a lunch, and there comes the Marshal! - Then they say that there is freedom! - We're not doing the "poems"! The imperative of the moment is to take away the suitcase! If they find it here, we wll all end up in! We can not turn with that suitcase in the hospital! - The marshal is waiting down! - I know! You wait outside the hospital, under the wall. I throw the suitcase to Ugo and Ugo hands it to you. Did you understand? Okay. So, Capannelle... Hello. - We'll come see you soon. - Sure. - Courage, Capannelle. - Go, if not returns the marshal. - Hello. Be cheerful, understand? Do not spend them all, equally. When I go out, I won't work anymore. Without that money, what I eat? Okay, I understand. 'Do not worry. Hello handsome. Damn... - Mario, is three hours looking for you! - Shut up! - Carmela kicked me! - How so? The major age is actually 18! It feels independent, she does not want to see us! She sais she will not open the door until our hands are dishonored! And Capannelle? It's Ugo! - Do you have a match? - No. A lot of health! And the suitcase ?! - The wretched Hugh! - Here I am, what? The suitcase! Force, shake everyone! - Come on! -It's coming! - It remains on! - Let me try! I'm down... I climb. - Come on! - The police! - We behave natural - Under whose turn! - Here I am! - Under whose turn! - Presto! - Power! - Right here you have to play ?! -Why? - Do not you see what's wrong? - What's wrong? - What? - This is a hospital! - Excuse me, we did not know it! - Let's go. Large and big... - Sometimes the nuts... - So much health! - Happy walking! My God, this suitcase! Keep! I'm tired of always doing the "breathing goat"! Do not get mad, we divide now and get it over with. I do not trust! If they catch one, they arrest us all and give us 13 years! - Bitter truth! - Be ', of course... In these cases the stolen goods must remain united and "global." Okay, but this "global" who keeps it? I have already done enough, you keep it! - I live in a sublet. - From tonight I do not have a home. - So you take it. - Not me! - Take that, take it! I assume the risk. But I keep everything. Do you understand? Because he has the alibi of the incensurated! - Of course! - Bravo! - What a bitch! Then divide it, scuse me! Let him keep it all. - You know what? - Thing? - Strangle yourself. We are not involved, right? We don't even know you. - Do you know your name? Judas! - Judas! - Wretch! - Hey, shepherd, what time is it? - Late. Now we can make peace with Carmela. - What do you say? - To be honest, I do not care of his affection. - Look, I... - But it was the good solution. In fact, I will tell you more. Put that in six months, when everything calmed down we ask Hugh to give us two or three million a piece. Do you think he does not give us? course he gives us. Maybe Ugo is "unpunished", however, is good. What do you say? - It can be. - You most certainly! Indeed, probably! Wait for me! Here I am! - And the suitcase ?! - Done! - Done what? We have nothing to fear, I put "the material evidence" under a bench. Then I phoned the police with the handkerchief on the microphone. I have given the location! Over and out! - What have you done ?! Coward! - You're crazy?! - What have you done?! First have made me a head as well, it seemed that was burning! And now you give me a coward! - Do not you have taken a little '? - We did not agree. Youngsters, run! - Where is it ?! - There, behind the bench! - We take a bunch for everyone. - Not more! - Open! - Who has the key? - The key? I do not know. - Who's got a knife? - I have a coral horn. You know what you must do with the coral corn? - Yes. Police! You called to the nearest police! Go away! Where are you running! Fool! Run 1000 miles per hour ?! You son of a... - Protest as well ?! - You did not see the zebra? What zebra? - The pedestrian crossing You have done a contravention. - At this hour? - The code is valid at all hours. Reconcilia? - What "reconciles"? You pay now? - But what "pay"? But you are exagerating ! Stop the thieves instead of pursuing the honest citizens who pay taxes! Please give me your generalities. Ugo! Mario! Ferribotte! "Me left alone", those four bastards!
