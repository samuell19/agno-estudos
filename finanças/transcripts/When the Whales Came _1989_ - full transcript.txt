WHEN THE WHALES CAME 1989 English subtitles by van26 Mother said that, if they killed the whales the island would be cursed but no one'd believe her then came the hunger, and the disease. One by one the families had to leave. Mother swore that she would never go, but then the well ran dry and we had to leave. It was the curse that drove us off Samson and that - was 70 years ago, and it's with us still. Never get it back now. Wind's taken it to Rushin Bay. We can't go there, too close to Birdman's cottage Oh he won't see us. Even if he does he can't hurt us. Who told you that? Big Tim. - He's just trying to frighten you. Come on.. Come on! We've gotta hurry it's your little brother. Sanctify this water, to the mystical washing away of sins, and grant that this child, now to be baptised therein, Daniel! Come here. May receive the fullness of your grace And ever remain within the number of thy elect children of thy elect children. What have you named this child? Albert. I baptise thee in the name of the Father, and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost. Amen. Amen. Enough of that! Daniel! Let's have some proper music, something to dance to. Hey you two - cut that out. Traey, Mary, come here. I want to say something. C'mon. Now as you know, there's not many of us here on Bryher right. So the arrival of young Albert here is not only welcome to his proud mother and father, He's a gift to all of us and we thank God for him. So if it's all right with you Vicar, I'd like to lead us in the old Scillonian prayer, which I think's fit. - Go on Will. Oh Lord, we would not that there should be wrecks, But if there must be wrecks, Wilt thou send them to Bryher, for the benefit of our poor inhabitants and of course young Albert here. Amen (chorus) Daniel don't go. Over here. Here! It's the one we lost. What does it mean? Must've been the Birdman. You don't know! Them letters on the beach, his initials. Must be You find out his name, then we'll know for sure. Why me? You can ask your father can't you? Perhaps.. Was sand down the aisle, you could hear people walking on't Damn boy put her up to it. Now don't go blaming Daniel. He gets enough of a battering from his father. Drew's a madman when he's drunk Never used to be like that. Well he's like it now. Anyway, Daniel asked for it, see? Oh leave Daniel be. He's a clever boy You seen those boats he makes? Grace does all the painting. C'mon eat up before it goes cold. It's grey mannock, you like that. Saw the Birdman today. - Oh yeah. He got a real name? I mean, everyone just calls hI'm the Birdman. Cmon Gracie eat up. Woodcock. Well That's what his mother was called anyway, Molly Woodcock. See for y'self, down in the graveyard. She's the last to leave Samson, her and the boy Mystery how they survived down there, the pair of them. Dunno - either she's crazy or a witch or something.. same with him. Nasty stories about those two. Yes and stories are all they are. What about Charlie Webber hey? Who's Charlie Webber? Never mind who. What have you and Daniel been up to? You havent been over to the Birdman's cottage have you? Course she hasn't. Eat your fish like your mother says. That fish lived just for us remember, So give 'I'm a reason for dying, hm? And maybe I'll take you out w'me in the boat tomorrow. It's school tomorrow, it's Monday. Oh be time enough for school on Tuesday! No Jack. She really has to go to school.

Cloud's coming up over Samson. Wind's getting up a bit fresh,too Best get back soon. You ever been there Father? To where? - Samson. No, course not. No one has. Anyone sets foot on that place, they're cursed for ever. But why? - Who knows? I don't understand the whys and wherefores, Gracie. It's cursed, all I know. Wouldnt go over there for all the tea in China. Keep clear of the place, Leave the Birdman alone, hm. Leave him to his birds. Promise me now. - I promise. (singing) my dad was a fisherman bold... Looks as if it could Lift off and fly. that's his duck, Watching us. I know he is Don't mind if he is. You can't write that. You know what I mean? He'll put curses on us No, if he wanted to put a spell on us, he could have done it already. He gave us a present, he doesnt want to hurt us. One day, I'm going to make something like this. What if someone finds it? What are we going to do then? They mustn't. You heard him Gracie. You've got a room of your own I thought I told you to sweep out this shed. Daniel, why d'ya never do nothing I tell ya? You don't work, you don't eat. Now get sweeping! What are you doing here! Clear off out of it. Daniel put more into it than that, lad.

Lets have some respect now. Twenty two only, Miss Garton Twenty two out of forty one, I don't know why we bother. Better than yesterday, Mr Willbeller Yeah but how can we teach 'em? They don't come to school. - Most of them do. Most of the time. Yeah .. what about those who do not come, most o' the time? Like this one.

Prob'ly been out fishing again. And now Miss Gracie, tell me what you'll be writing during the break? One hundred times, and neat, mind. Yes sir. Where were you yesterday boy? Had to work sir. Father kept me at home in a boat shed. Honest sir. - Honest? Don't know the meaning of the word. I've spoken to your father on a number of occasions He has assured me quite categorically he never keeps you away fom school to work in the boatshed. Y'know what the punishment is for lying. Yes sir. But if you punish them when they do come to school- They have to learn. It's our job to teach 'em. Thank you sir. His dog's called Prince. - How do you know? 'Cos he told me, wrote it in the sand There he is. What did I tell you And there'll be a message too. You'll see. You'll see. What's it mean? What's it for? Left him a message, Told him I wanted to learn to carve, just like him. Can't be no harm in him, can there? We've nothing like this at home. And the house fell upon the lords, and upon the people, that were therein So the dead which he slew at his death Were more than they which he slew in his life. Good. Sit down boy. Samson, children. There is much to be learned from Samson. The Philistines are upon us. Philistines are upon us. Poor beguiled Samson, but we must not be caught asleep. We have our own Philistines children, and they will be upon us if we should slumber! I mean... the Germans, the Hun! As we all call him He is our Philistine! And mark my words, before this year is out we shall be at war with him, or maybe sooner. It will come to war, I know it will. Dismissed. It's good. It's the best one I've ever made. How're we going to give it to the Birdman? I'm not going out to his cottage. - Won't have to. Same way as he gave us the cormorant Holidays. Just look 'round this table. I've got 7 mouths to feed. That Jenkins, he's only got three. I've got seven! How'd you think it's done ay? Magic? I can't have you dodging off, you little devil. Don't call him that. I'll call him what I please. Spends all his time with that Jenkins girl And when he isn't off with her, he's ??farbin his typos ?? He's only young. Young! When Tim was his age he was working all day in the shed. Yeah I was. Can I go, Mother? You can help Tim on the boat. Make sure you giv'im plenty to do Tim. - I will. don't go getting yourself all wet, now don't go getting yourself all wet, now? that's why he's like he is. you coddle him. Always have! How's he ever going to grow up big and strong if you baby him all his life? Big and strong aren't everything. Puts food in y'mouth, doesn't it? Don't shout. Who's shouting! You're upsetting Albert. He's not well. He'll be all right, Just needs some fresh air, that's all. I'm going out. Coming, Tim? Wonder what he goes off to Samson for? P'raps he goes fishing over there. Nah, he's always out in rough weather Ghosts over there, only have to look at it to tell. Don't believe in ghosts. I do. Brought Daniel with me. So I see. Hello Daniel. There's some hot soup on the stove if you want it. No thanks. Where's Father? He's gone to a meeting, they've all gone. What for? Here - dry your hair Gracie, you're soaking wet. What's happened? The war's happened. War? - Bob said there wouldn't be a war, he said so. Think he was wrong, Gracie. That's how to do it. Remember? Take care Mr Woodcock. Take care It's the Birdman's - Could be anyone's. He's been wrecked, I know he has. I'm going up there. It's all right Gracie, honest it is. (knocks) Thank you Daniel. I was afraid you'd never come. Here - look out here. Look out there. Can you see 'im? The whole bay is full of timber I lost an oar out there. Bit of a job getting my boat back through 'em, Not easy with one oar. We found it Mr Woodcock, it's down on the beach. We thought you were done for, me and Gracie. Why we came up here. We weren't prying honest Just wanted to see if you and Prince got back safely. door was open. Saw you yesterday going off to Samson. We were Down on the beach. And we saw you, off on your boat. So when we found the oar. we thought - Tell him about something else, tell him about the war. War's begun, Mr Woodcock, just like Wellybelly said. I'm deaf, Daniel, Im as deaf as they are. I can't even hear the sea. You got something you want to tell me, youll have to write it down. Here - you spell better. tell him about the war. It's wrong. It's wicked. All killin' is wicked! Never mind. You best be going now, and quickly Won't do that timber no good to be left in the sea. Tell 'em to get to Stony Par as quick as they can. you get on back now. Here! Come back here, I got something Don't think there's much more I c'n do with this 'un. Would you like to take it with you? Beautiful. Beau - t - iful. Thank you. - Thank you Mr Woodcock.

Well give us me coat back, I'm froze to death. Wouldn't mind if I take a look around, will you? It's your job, Mr. Bullhead, I know that Lot of timber's been washed up at St Martin's, any found here? Not so far as I know. I'll look at the beaches on the west side first. Strange. What's strange? Stony Par. Clean as a whistle down there. You'd thought a storm like that would have thrown up a lot of debris. Very strange. - yeah. Perhaps they've already been out to pick up the driftwood. Maybe. (faintly) He's coming. He's coming! He's coming in here! Come quickly Hello sir! - Preventative. Mind if I take a look around Mr Jenkins? - No, course not, come on in We're after timber. Good sound timber, worth a lot of money. I dare say. You seen any of it? Would've come in on yesterday's tide. West Coast. - West coast you say? No we hardly ever go over that side of the island. Dangerous there Y'know, sea gets up and you're down on the rocks, you're a goner.. No, youve had a good look over there? - Couldn't see anything. No, I'm afraid I can't .. Mr Jenkins I'd like to remind you that any such timber is the property of the Crown. You do understand that Yes I'm a law abiding man, Mr. Bullhead same as we all are on Bryher, Yes. Perhaps your little Gracie's seen something Now then, Gracie you see any timber? No sir. You have, havent you! If she says she hasn't, then she hasn't Mr Bullhed. I see. Well if you've got nothing to hide, won't mind if I search the house will you? - No, 'course not. Help yourself. Start from the roof and work downwards. It's all right Gracie - be gone soon. Come on. Well I did say there'd be dead birds up here didnt I? Look Clem what I found, Clem. Lasted so long, we almost forgot we'd got it. Look'a that. You havent see this before Gracie, have you? my grandfather made this, over.. well I don't know Fifty years or so ago, now. - I'd forgotten all about that. Often wondered where it got to. Enough of it up there now, ay. I'll be off then. - Right. Thanks for this! - Glad to be of service. Well? Me and Daniel made it - honest! You don't expect me to believe that do you? Ask him if you like. - Now, Gracie I know Daniel's clever with his hands, but- anyway what was it doing in the roof? It was a Christmas present. It was a secret! I'm never ever ever going to give you anything ever again. I'll go, shall I? She's not going to believe this. Lemme? Lemme.. Lemme He made this one, too. You made this all by hourself? Mmm, on my own. How did you learn? I taught myself. It's really beautiful, Danny. It's perfect, ever see anything like that? That cormorant, it's really beautiful. Gracie. - Gracie. Come on down, Daniel's here. I'm sorry Gracie. Forgiven, am I? Mmm? Damn right girl. Safe until next time. You look like a pair of moths caught in a spider's web, hey. You've never mended nets before have you? Course I have. - Well it don't much look like it. C'mon. Well it's a right pig's ear you made of this one, isn't it? Father said I've got to stay in till i finish it Ah, well, drive a cart through this one, couldn't you. Now you take my old man, God rest his soul. He brought me up in the proper manner Just as well he did, I can tell you. Did you teach you that as well? Soon as I could walk! Like talking to yourself.. You're faster than anyone. You want to watch out for this one Captain, I tell you Here, Captain! Don't forget your parrot. It's a puffin. Where are those two off too? I don't know. Up to no good, I shouldn't wonder. - You shouldn't be at all suprised. Make a fine pair though don't they? Your Gracie's got an eye on him, you know. Bit young for that ain't they? Oh Jack, never too young for that, You're only too old! I don't know - Wonder what sort of life it's going to be for them when we're gone, Will oh much the same as before. not so sure. Theres no life for them, stuck out here. Oh I see. So you're thinking of leaving are you Jack? I've thought about it.

Must have been a thousand planks, And we just made 'em disappear. He can't understand you, can see that. Talk with your lips, Daniel and slowly. Use your hands, and not too many words.

Now pay attention They have more soldiers and more guns. And everywhere our brave little army is holding. Over here near Ypres we have driven them back We must be vigilant. For there are spies everywhere, And they must be rooted out, I tell you We will now sing the national anthem as we have done every morning and as we shall do until the war is won. And sing it loud children, So they can hear it over there, in France. Mr Garton! (piano) God save our gracious King.. You know what this is? Where'd you find it? Hey? It's off one of our ships. Hundred men or more lost. Good men. You're playing with it, like a toy. Go home.

Jack you can't blame yourself, you can't take the whole world on your shoulders. - But it's not good enough Clem is it? Not for me. I'll never be able to do it. I can't do it like that.

You'll have to thank God for those. if I could just get out and do a bit of fishing. But I told you, me and Daniel No Gracie, I told you its too dangerous you're not going out there. You steering ?? - Yeah. I'm trying to, anyway. Tide's too strong. It's going to take us out to sea. Unless we head for Samson. - You can't, you mustn't. We have to. We'll get taken out there.. (Gracie singing) I'm thirsty. - Should be a well somewhere. Dry. Let's try further up. Thought it was carved at first. It's off a unicorn, a real unicorn! no such thing. - How do you know? Tide'll turn soon. No hurry to get back, Father's going to strap me anyway. We mustn't tell him we went to Samson. Only make things worse We went out fishing, got lost. He won't mind - couldn't hardly help it could we? Im going to teach him a damn good lesson. - You go easy on him, Tre Family business, Will. Steal my boat would you? - I wasnt, I was only borrowing it! Every boat on this island's been out looking for you. Oh Gracie promise me, you'll never ever ever do that again. I promise. I know why you went on that boat Gracie. And I know that your father would've been proud of you. And I am too. War can't last for ever, can it? No. Here take your milk and go up to bed. You're cold. don't you never go near that island. Never - do you hear. (Clem sobbing) Gracie- Gracie come here. He's not coming back Gracie. He's not coming back. There is no greater sacrifice Than a man laying down his life for his friends. As our Lord himself has showed us We honor their memory, We shall not forget. Remember now, As we say the blessing. The blessing of God almighty, the Father the Son and the Holy Ghost Be with us all, evermore. Amen. (Amen) Gracie, can I come in just for a minute How art thee? - Well. I've just come to pay my respects, Clem To say how sorry we all are, Maisie, the children and me. I'll come back. Just to say were praying for you. You know there's been people in and out of here all day, And not one of them have mentioned Jack. They're frightened to say his name. Anything I can do to help dear. You've only got to ask. I know. It was him! I don't understand. Mr Woodcock! No you mustn't. It was him all the time. So how did he know? By the time we've finished with his kyte ??, he won't want to live there any more! But- how'd he know this boy anyway? We know. We seen the fires he lights, don't we? Burn him out! - Yeah Drive 'im off the island for good. You don't do nothing I tell you, do you? I told you to maintain nets, I told you to clean out the lobster pots! You didn't do it, any of it. Spend your time larking around with those fool friends of yours But I'll show you. Shed for you! Gracie. Gracie wake up. C'mon, it's the Birdman, he needs us. Look there he is. What is it? It's like - the ones - on Samson isn't it? There'll be others out there, and they'll all come in. We've got to get him back into the water Else they'll all beach themselves, just like they did before. But theyre bur-ning it down - burning Why... it doesnt matter.. this is all that matters now. Weve got to get it back in the sea Tim, before it dies You gotta help us, the Birdman sys. Will you help us? I help you? That whale belongs to all of us! If you want it for yourself, you've got to drag it above high water mark You wanted help - I'll get you help! I'll get you all the help you need. He wants to - kill it, Mr Woodcock, Not this time. that's just how it happened on Samson. What did happen? Why don't YOU tell me? You know, when I was little, I lived on Samson It was a hard place to live And then, one day, a whale came just like this one. My mother and me tried to roll it back into the sea, but we couldn't move it. And all the time more and more whales were coming in. and then the islanders came, and I thought they were going to help us, but They only wanted to kill the whales. And so the slaughter began. See there, didnt I tell you? that's a nalwa Wonderful ivory they say. Look we don't care what that creature is, It's all money to us. If it washes up on our shores, it's ours. Its always been that way! - Right. Daniel, Mr Woodcock, out of the way now. C'mon, full shares all round. That's the way it is on this island, always has been No! No you mustn't. Daniel! God does indeed move in mysterious ways Daniel. He sends the riches of the sea for all of us to share in. You told us it caught fire But you never told us how. Well, cos he's a spy! Don't talk soft lad. He's no spy! Its no use Father, he's deaf. Deaf! Theyre going - to kill - him. Then they'll have to kill me first! That creature must be saved, we must get him back in the water. And then we must drive 'em all back out to sea where they belong. What are we waiting for? Come on! You - must - tell - them. It happened before, on Samson. The whales came. The islanders couldn't believe their luck. They slaughtered them all. Took the horns for sale on the mainland. Found one later washed up Their ship went down with all hands. My father among 'em. My mother'd told them that Samson was cursed. But, no one believed 'er. Then came the hunger and the disease. One by one the families had to leave We were the last to go, my mother and me. She always swore she'd never leave my father's ghost behind on the island But then- the well, the well ran dry. We had to go. It's been dry since we left. That was the curse of Samson, dried the well. And silenced my ears... I've done all I can to fight it. All my life I've warned everyone off I go over there every day whenever there's a storm, Light the beacon, keep the ships off the rocks. I done all I could, but it was not enough Now do you see WHY these creatures must be saved? It's true. I can see it - why can't you? Well I don't know what's happening any more than you do, But what I do know is, we've got to get that creature back in the sea. (cheers) It's not over yet. Look at 'em. They're coming in. We're going to have to turn them before high tide. How. - I don't know. Fire. That will do it Will. Fire! By God, you're right. Get anything that'll burn, anything! That'll move them. Come on! You've done enough Mr Willcock. Tell him, Daniel Tell him he's done enough. We're stayin'. Just in case. All right. Come on, Vicar He's out there. He's gone.. Free at last. What's that bell ringing? - don't know, let's go and see What is it? - ?? to try us as well, did you? Bit late for breakfast, aren't I? All right. C'mon girl Welcome back Jack. Welcome back. C'mon. All right you look fine Jack. Thanks Trev. (singing) What are you after? go on then. - Thank you. (singing)
