And they were both naked, and were not ashamed. Now the serpent was subtler than any beast of the field. And he asked the woman: Is it truth that God said: Shall ye not eat of every tree in the garden? And the woman said: unto the serpent: We eat the fruit of the trees in The Garden of Eden. But of the fruit of the tree in the midst of the Garden, God said: You shall not eat of it, lest ye die. And the serpent said to the woman: Ye shall not surely die On the day ye eat thereof, your eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as gods, knowing both good and evil. Tell me the truth Who is it? What are you eating? Want some? No. This will be the one who, should have come yesterday. Sleep. -I have a taste for something. -What? Good morning. Is this yours? Look. Isn't this your briefcase? Nice weather today. See? The mail. Let me see. Not all of them. I know. Be good. Here's one more. You've got six letters. You're winning. Almost white... White... Another white one... Not completely white... Perfumed. So... -What's wrong? -Nothing. Do you think you'll ever tell me the truth? Like who this letter is from? You're in a bad mood again, aren't you? Who knows what it's all about. Punta, come here... Jump. Come... I'm starting a vegetable patch here. I'm growing vegetables for my husband. But the soil is hard here. See? Hard soil. And the slugs are here. So we meet again, madam. Yes, indeed. I have to go now. Goodbye. Careful, hold me. Sorry. -Didn't I say that? -How could this happen? Next time will be better. Here... Careful. That's right. You've got to keep your balance. -Look out. -I don't want it anymore. You always spoil it. This will be better. -Here we go. -Not alone. No. Yes, once more. -I don't want to. -Yes, you do. I want to go home. Don't even think about it. Here... -Just sit down and ride. -Don't tickle me. Let's go. This time it'll be better. What's the matter? You won't mind if I go out for a while? I would. Bye then. Is that you, Robert? Where are you? I know you're here. Bye then. Good morning. I've got you now. Just you wait. You scoundrel. You're here at last. Just you wait. I'll show you. We must take some nice trips again. Let me go. Could I read with you? -Reading is profound. -Good morning. You've really grown up. Don't run away. Wait. Good morning. -You know her? -No. good morning. You're here for the first time, aren't you? Yes. Who is he? -I don't know him. -That's Mr. Robert. He's been coming here for seven years for treatment. He's excellent company. And he's on his own. On top of everything he's single. Not many men are that lucky at his age? Lovely little hands. Dear lady, allow me. You can tell me... How old are you? Guess. Well... Fifty... two. -Far from it. 78. -78? Seventy eight. -Impossible. -But true. You've lived to a ripe old age... Where have you been wandering so long this year? Me? Busy working. Bye then. May I swing with you? May I also have a little swing? May I? Sorry, I didn't want to trouble you. You come to places, where no one would find you. Never. I didn't search for you. Look. Please. Could I tell you something? -You should stop while the going's good. -That's right. Six. What happened? He lost his key. Really? There it is. Here. I saw it here somewhere. I'm always so careful. -Do you know that? -Yes. All my things are in order. Look, it was in my pocket. Really? What's wrong? Everyone is waiting for you. Go. I'm going. Little hand... sand... Here's something for us. The mysterious murderer strikes again. Listen. For almost a year the public has been disturbed by the mysterious murders of blonde girls. It doesn't concern you. -Last night another blonde was found... -Let me see too. What impertinence. -Last night... -Last night... Did you find it? Yes, I did. Want some? Let's see. Mr. Robert will read it for us. He knows how. Here it is. Last night, another blonde was found... She was shot in an unusual way... Her forehead was stamped with a red number six. She's evidently the sixth victim of this murderer. The police continue to search for him. A remarkable detail. The number six was deeply etched on her forehead. Josef. Wake up. Wake up, please. Eva. Open your eyes. Forget about everything. Forgive me. I've committed a sin against you. Forgive me. Please. I lied to you. But I didn't know what I was doing. Forgive me. Don't turn away from me You're my wife. And I'm your husband. That's not true! And what is true? You're not my husband. How so? You have someone else? Let go. You're just like him. Who? You're all the same. Sorry, I was just passing by. I just happened to lean against your door. Is that him? Yes. That's the murderer. Don't pretend to be drumming here. Go home. Now. Get dressed and come out. Come out. Come on. She must've talked about me. I can see how you look at me. Will you admit it? What did I do to you? What do you think of me? You debaucher. Let me go. You rat. I heard someone banging. It's sultry hot. I'll show you something. Did you see that angel? What a heavy statue. Things should have their proper weight. What a beauty. Now it's well illuminated. Look at those lovely legs. I'm too scared to look. She's finished. Where are you going? Let go! Such a lovely day. Are you mad? There you are. I don't understand anything anymore. I understand you. Call me Robert. I never thought I'd be so alone here. She should've been here an hour ago. I thought you'd be here alone. Good afternoon. What kept you so long? In a church. Sou you won't tell me? Waiter. Ice cream, please. Here you are. A light? See that? I understand you. I've never disgraced her like this. -It's been a lovely day, gentleman. -Yes. The weather's lovely, madam. I've never done her any wrong. She should forgive me, shouldn't she? She doesn't know enough about it, anyway. Don't you feel sorry for her? We all have to die anyway. Come on a trip with me, sir. I need to relax. Splendid. Yes, great idea. Off you go, you two. Be careful. Are you afraid of me? No. Why? So you're not afraid of me? You should be afraid of me. Listen. I tell the truth. Doesn't matter, we're friends. Don't you believe me, Robert? Why not? I know. But friendship isn't possible without trust. You have to kill me, Robert. You have to kill me. You want me to kill you? How do you kill someone? You have to be brave. Do you like stones? I do. I know a deserted place. I prepared a beautiful stone for you there. Don't be afraid. But you're not afraid. You have to come tonight. Will you come? -Will you? -I'll come. Will you recognise that stone? Yes, I will. Couldn't you just cut it out? No, she couldn't. Can I talk to you, Robert? No, you can't. Robert has a date. I think she was right when she said you were a murderer. If you want, I don't go there. But you tell her. Robert. Is that you, Robert? Yes, it's me, Robert. Come. Damn. This is really lovely place... ...for our love. And you... How beautiful you are. Tell me, how did you get over there? I hope you didn't wait long for your Robert. But I'm here now. Here I am Come. Don't you love me anymore? Or perhaps you're afraid of your husband? Let go. To our health. The wine is really excellent. Do you like it? Thank you, it's perfect. Will you have another drink with me? Would you like something else? No, thank you. I forgot to tell you Robert left. At least he promised me. Would you like to dance? -Me? -Yes. With pleasure. May I? Excuse me, my husband would like to dance with you. May I? Robert? Are you there? I'm tired. Don't leave me alone. Here I am. Do you want to kill me? See, I didn't forget. You want to kill me now, that I love you? But I love you too. That's why we're here. I'll always love you, I swear. It's the first time in my life that I believe someone. And you could kill me? Is that true? I don't have to lie to you. No. What is it? I'm cold. You're cold? I couldn't bear that, my darling. This will warm you up. You don't know how much I love you. How beautiful you are. Let me see. Look at me. You're the only one who came of her own free will. That was the last time I believed someone. That's betrayal. Yes, it's all a lie. No. It was true. Tell me the truth! Josef. It's me. Eva. Don't turn away from me. Don't ask to know the truth! Even I don't want to know it! And when Eva saw, that the tree was good to eat, and tree desirable for making one wise... She took of the fruit and ate. And gave also/i> to her husband and he ate. And both their eyes. were opened, and they saw they were naked. And they heard the voice of God walking in paradise in the cool of the day. And the man and the wife hid themselves the presence of the Lord among the fruit trees of paradise.
