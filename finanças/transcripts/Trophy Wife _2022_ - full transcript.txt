Yeah. Get into the bag. Get into the paper. I want some land. I want neighbors. Seat in the grass, not on the pavement. You see the sass. I need a payment. I'm talking big boats, big yachts. I tell a bitch, go kick rocks. I hate a bitch that ain't minding her business. She's just a fan. I ain't signing no pictures. I got the money bags, money bags, money bags. I got the money bags, money bags, money bags. I got the money bags, money bags, money bags. I got the money bags, money bags, money bags. Don't want me to lose, don't want me to win. They said I can't do it. I did it again. If you don't eat it, I get with his friend. I ain't on nine, bitch. I'm on 10. How about you not be so worried about me? Maybe you should be worrying about paying your rent. Maybe they asking me... Good morning, sleepyhead. Good morning, baby. I can't. I got an early meeting, and I'm running late. What? Yeah. We just got here. Another late night meeting? Toni, don't start. You promised me you would spend more time at home. But when business calls, I got to answer. Well, your wife misses you. Look, I miss you, too. And I promise we'll have a romantic dinner tonight, OK? How about a little dessert? You know, as much as I would love that, I can't. So, uh, what y'all getting into today? Nicole is coming back for lunch later. All right. Sounds like fun. It's not what you think. What am I thinking, Marc? I can explain. You promised me. Look, I swear to God, nothing happened. Smells like another woman. It was a strip club. A strip club? Yeah, a strip club. Clients wanted to go. They had a couple of lap dances. That's it. I don't believe you. Who is she? Look, baby, I swear to God, nothing happened last night. - Who is she? - Hey, you need to calm down. Who... Calm down! You know what happens when you get upset. You take your meds? Don't do that. I am not crazy. I know you're not crazy. But with your depression, your anxiety? I just want to make sure you're following doctor's orders. Look, I got to go. But I'm gonna come home early, we're gonna get some quality time, OK? Well, hello, handsome. Hey, yourself. I've never seen you around here before. Yeah, well, I'm new here. Hmm. Well, I'm Nicole, by the way. August. You look familiar. Well, I guess I just have one of those faces. Hmm. I guess I'll see you around. I'm sure you will. Damn, you fine. Toni, girl! Hey, girl. Oh my God, this spread is amazing. Maggie, you really outdid yourself. Girl, I got to get you something nice. Let me get a plate. Earth to Toni! My bad. Hoo. Girl, you have been holding out. Girl, what are you talking about? That specimen that is laying your grass. August? Mm-hmm. Well, I ain't even seen him. Please. What you mean, you ain't noticed? That man is fine. Because I got better things to do than sit and watch my landscaper all day. Well, he can landscape my yard any time he wants to. Calm your little hormones down, OK? Shouldn't you be focused on your wedding to Victor? Oh, God. Don't remind me. Between his busy schedule and mine, we ain't even set a date. What? You still waiting to move in? Uh, yeah. You don't get this cookie until you buy the whole cookie jar. Hmm. Toni, what's wrong? Marc. What now? He was out all night. Again. Again? Where did he say he was this time? Girl... Excuse me, ladies. Miss Toni, where do you want them? You can just put it over there. Hmm. The strip club. Talking about his business. I am so sick of his lies. All it is lie, after lie, after lie. I'm fed up. Honey, I am so sorry. You deserve so much more than what he's giving you. OK? And he was the one that said he wanted a family. Now he can't even come home? Is that too much to ask? No, it's not. Listen, you're gonna drive yourself crazy. Just end up in a loony bin or something like that. Like my mother? Toni, I didn't mean that. I'm sorry. Your mother was her own woman. She had her own problems. I just want you to focus on your own well-being. I'm stressed out. I know. I can't eat. I'm not sleeping. You gonna be all right. Now, tell me about this landscaper. Thank you, girl. Come on. Promise me you'll get some rest? Mm-hmm. I promise. All right. All right. I'll check on you later. Love you. Hey, Miss Toni. Are you good? It is what it is. Right, right. Well, I hope you feel better. Really? A flower? Yes, a gift from me to you. You're smiling already. Just take it. That's really cute. Um, have a good day, August. Bye, Miss Toni. Yeah, man. New interface looks great with the game. Yeah, yeah. It's looking really good. Yeah, the demo should be done by the end of the month. I'm really excited about it. I think it's gonna be great. Well, hello, beautiful. Long time no see. How have you been? Good. That's great. OK, great. Marc, Carmen's here. Hey, Thomas. I'm going to have to call you back a little bit later. Maybe next week? Yeah no problem, Marc. All right, man, bye. All right, man. Hey, glad you were able to make it. I'm glad I'm able to make it as well. Have a seat. Can I get you a drink? Oh, no. I'm actually good. Thank you. OK. OK, so if there's nothing else, I'm going to get ready to head out. Remember, you have the meeting with Victor. Yeah. And the prepping for the anniversary party, remember? I'll send you a reminder email. Thank you, Wanda. I'll see you tomorrow. Bye, girl. All right, bye-bye. If it wasn't for Wanda, I'd forget my own name. Yeah, you always been like that. Well, you know, getting old. Yeah, nothing has changed. Hey, Marc, I tried... Sorry. You're in a meeting. Victor Morales, I'd like you to meet the beautiful Carmen Riley from "Just Be Me" magazine. She's interviewing me for Holden's anniversary. Nice to meet you, Victor. I'm pretty sure I'll be needing to talk to you soon as well. Sure. Nice meeting you. Hey, can you meet me in the conference room? I want to show you a deck I'm presenting to the venture capitalist tomorrow. Well, I can't. We're about to have dinner. Can we just talk about it tomorrow? Yeah, yeah. Whatever you say. I'll let you finish your meeting. OK. Sorry about that. You always have something up your sleeve. Dinner? Mm-hmm. You know, I just realized, I haven't eaten anything all day. Hmm. Well, I guess you better be lucky that I'm not turning down a free meal, then. I hope not. I know a good spot near here. Let's go. All right. Let's go somewhere where we can be alone, pulling you close, wrapped in your arms. By the way you're looking in my eyes, I can tell you want me now. I ain't worried about no wait, miss. I'm gonna kill it till you make a sound. Ooh, like a siren, you're going off. And we're spilling everywhere like somebody left the lid off. The way that I feel, ain't no way I'm going. So just watch that beast come out of me, girl, like a monster. Standing in pain, take the charge. Like we got unfinished business, let's link back up tomorrow. I'm gonna have you feeling you can take on an army, if they standing in between with you in front of me. I'm gonna go to work on your body like an army. No surrender. I ain't gonna light you up like the morning. I'm gonna have you feeling you can take on an army if they standing in between with you in front of me. Oh. Who would have thought, you know? After all these years, us connecting again. I... I got a confession to make. What is that? When "Just Be Me" magazine called me for an interview, I requested you. Really? Really. Well, speaking of work, we got to get back to that interview, right? Let's do it. So talk to me. 10 years of designing and selling games. Mm-hmm. All of them which landed in the best top 10 sellers list, may I add, you know, that's very impressive. Thank you. How does a wife like yours deal with having such a successful husband? Well, first of all, she's fine. Hmm? She has nothing to worry about. Because at the end of the day, I'll always choose her. Hmm. Really? Mhm. We just work. Hmm. Her name, status got me into a lot of important rooms. I wouldn't have Holden without her. Right. But it seems like you're the one with the status now, right? No more talk about work. Or my wife. Oh. So what do you want to talk about? Let's make up for lost time. I guess the interview's over. Toni, come on, babe. Open the door. I'm sorry. Toni. Come on, babe. Open the door. I called you several times last night. Hmm. I'm sorry, babe. Sorry? That's all you have to say? I'm sorry? "Sorry" should have brought your ass home last night. I can't even believe you. And you're never gonna change. You act like I did this on purpose. You do, Marc. And it's time for you to make some better choices. What kind of choices are you talking about? I'm talking about you considering selling the business, so we can start our family. What? You promised me. I gave up a successful modeling career because you wanted me to stay home and raise our children. Where our babies at, Marc? All I get from you is lies and women. Women? Where all these imaginary women that you're talking about? Don't play me, Marc. I packed all your shit, and I put it in the guest room. You don't care about spending time with me anyways, right? Toni, don't do this. It's done. And I'm done with this conversation. I'm so sick of Marc and his lies that it has my anxiety at an all-time high. Are you still having a hard time sleeping? No idea. I don't know what to do. Have you felt the urge to harm yourself? I'm not cutting anymore, if that's what you mean. OK, that's good. I'm really happy to hear that. The progress that you've been making, Toni, has just been phenomenal. Now, at times it may feel difficult, but you are managing your stress. OK, so what do I do? Well, I'm still going to write you a prescription to help you with your sleeping. Please, don't give me any more pills. The last pills you gave me, they made me lethargic. My mind was all foggy. I understand, but it's just your body getting adjusted. That's all. So let's just stick with it for now, and we'll see how it goes. I just reviewed the terms of the deal. And I think we can make this happen. Yeah, yeah. Just... just give me a couple of days. Let me talk it over with Marc, and I'll get back to you. Actually, we're having our 10-year anniversary of Holden Gaming tonight, and the Carters are hosting. You should... you should come through. Yeah. All right. I'll... I'll send you the information later. All right, bye. Hey, babe. What you doing? Well, well, well. Isn't this a nice surprise? I was in the neighborhood. I thought I'd come by and see my handsome fiancé. Well, I'm glad you did, because it made my day. Hmm! While I'm here, we might as well make an appointment with the wedding planner. Or... or we can head straight for the Justice of Peace right now. Hmm. Hmm? What would you say to that? You better stop. Where's Marc? I don't know. I can't keep up anymore. It's like... it's like he's avoiding me. What happened? Just ever since we got this... This offer to buy us out, he's just been ghosting me. I mean, I get it. He doesn't want to talk about selling, but this... This will change the game for both of us. Well, he's gonna come around. Yeah, he better. Because we only got a small window to sell. Plus, I need all the money I can get to fund this wedding you're planning, right? Hmm? - Yes, you do. - Mm-hmm. Yeah. Hey, sunshine. You're home early. I thought I told you you were staying in the guest bedroom. Well, I haven't been around much lately, and I wanted to make it up to you. Hmm. Open it. Come on, let me show you some love. Please, open the bag. It's nice. Look, Toni, don't be like that. I'm trying. If you were trying, I'd have babies by now. If you were trying, you wouldn't have to give me this peace offering. If you were trying, you would love me. I do love you. I don't know what's wrong with me. I know you deserve better, and I want to give you better. Just give me a chance to try. How many chances do you need? Toni, I am begging you, just let me try. You really think it's that easy, huh? You can just come in here with expensive gifts, kisses and what? I'm supposed to? Melt No. You just don't even take anything serious, unless it's Holden Games. This is our marriage. You do not get to keep hurting me. I know. And that's why I'm here with you, in our home. I want to start over. I want to start a family. I want to start now. Why are you calling me so late? Yeah, I know I promised to come over, but plans changed. You know, this thing, this isn't working for me. It's over. Good night. Mom, what are you doing here? The party's not till tonight. Well, hello to you, too, son. Yeah, Mom wanted us to come early, to see if you needed help on anything. We've got everything covered. You know I do have a staff. Where's Toni? Uh, she's out shopping with her grandmother. I thought she wasn't feeling well. Yeah, didn't you say she had some sort of a breakdown? London. I mean, that is what you said, right? She's got some anxiety issues, but she's dealing with it. But she has to get herself healthy. Everybody knows she wants a house full of children. Grandkids would be great right about now. We are working on it. I just wish you wasn't so far away from the family. 45 minutes is not that far away. It's far enough. Hmm. Seems like ever since you got with Toni, she's pushed you further and further away from the family. No, no, hold on. No, you need to stop that. Why? She's always acting... You pushed her away, and you never gave her a chance. She's always acting like she's better than us. - That's not true. - Yes, it is. Look, enough, you two. Y'all making me feel like I'm still raising teenagers. This is driving me crazy. Doris, London. Hmm. Why are you here so early? We came by to help you set up for the party. We didn't want you to stress yourself trying to handle everything alone. No, ma'am. That's not necessary. I'm sure Marc told you everything is covered. I did. Maggie, can you take these upstairs, please? Thank you. Miss Thing, I see you still out spending up all your accounts at those bougie boutiques again. And this is coming from someone who doesn't have an account or a job, for that matter? What you say? Hey, Mom, Sis, let's just go by the pool and hang out? Let's go upstairs. Maggie will bring us some drinks, all right? Can you join us for a bit? London wants to run something by you. What, for another loan? And what if it is? It's not like you can't afford it. Look, Marc, I thought you told me everything was good between the two of you. Everything is fine. Just, you know how she is. Baby girl, I can't take my eyes off of you when you're dancing. Oh, darling, there is nothing I'd rather do than dance with you. Isn't she fancy? London, don't start. She's your brother's wife, for God's sake. Fine. Oh, is that my girl? Oh, Nini. Girl, you look like you're about to rip the runway again. Thank you, girl. You look good, too. Oh, Marc, I like that look, too. Y'all look like cake-toppers. Come on, give me a hug. What can I say? It's a special night. Me and Victor are celebrating our milestone, and my wife put together an incredible party. Yes, everything turned out nice. Can you guys hold on for a second? I got to go holler at Victor. Girl, let me see this bracelet. This looks like the one I've been eyeing. Did Marc get this for you? Yeah I guess he feels like it'll make up for his cheating. If you like it so much, you can have it. - Toni. - Take it off. No! I don't know if I should. I do like it. And as soon as I get into the office Monday, I'll talk to Marc and we'll get things squared away, figure out the next steps. What's up, man? Hey, man. How's it going? What the hell is Matthew Armstrong doing here? He's my guest. I wanted him to see how good we were doing. I see. Yeah. Yeah, we were just trying to figure out the next step. Next steps? Holden's not for sale. Come on, Marc. What's your problem? Problem? If I don't know any better, I'd think you were trying to sell this company out from behind my back. I told you I was talking with different investors. There's a big difference between talking with investors and talking to buyers. Matthew... Matthew wants to acquire Holden for $200 million. Man, for the last time, I am not selling. Yeah. Yeah, well, this ain't your company by yourself. But you can't sell it without me. And it ain't gonna happen unless I'm in a bodybag. Yeah, well, if that's what you want. It's like that? Yeah. It's like that. Everything OK? Yeah. Sorry if we caused any disturbances. You look amazing, by the way. Thank you. Can I borrow my husband? Yeah. Yeah, he's... he's all yours. What's going on? He wants to sell Holden for $200 million. So what's the problem? Sell the company. The problem is that I don't want to sell. You promised me you would spend time with me. Again, it's about you. About me? I try so hard. I've worked so hard to try and make you happy and... and it's never enough. You're selfish. I'm selfish? Yes. The last person you can call selfish is me. I've done nothing but give. And I'm sick and tired of coming second to your job. Hey, Toni. You all right? Not really. Look, it won't always be like this. Thank you. I was just trying to get him down the aisle, Mama. OK? Yeah. Well, don't try too hard. Maybe you're pushing him away if you're trying... I mean, he asked. Oh, well, then when are the plans? We're going to plan soon. Oh. He's just been busy with the company. Hey, hey. How are you? Congratulations. Thank you. Have a seat. See you. Hey, babe. Hey. You, uh... you ready to leave? I know I am. How are you gonna leave your own party? It's Marc. I... I just I can't with him right now. That fool still don't want to sell. I'll just make you a stiff drink. Enjoy this old school music, and I'm gonna check on you later. Yeah. All right? Yeah. All right. Girl, who is that over there talking to Marc? I don't know. But she's gorgeous. And she looks like Marc's type. Another drink. Uh-uh. Girl, you know you're not supposed to be drinking. Nicole, give me this drink. I'm going over there. Let me know if you need backup. Well, don't you look good tonight. Carmen, why are you here? Well, I just figured since we was working on the article, it wouldn't be right unless I spoke to your wife. That is not a good idea. You need to go. I'm here. Hey, babe. This is Carmen from "Just Be Me" magazine. She's doing an interview about me and Victor and Holden. It's so nice to meet you. Such a beautiful dress, Toni. So is Carmen the reason you're out late at night? Toni, don't do this. Don't do what? Just asking a question. Uh, you shouldn't be drinking that in your condition. Oh, I... I didn't know you were so sick. You hide it so well. I'm perfectly fine. Oh. Well, listen, I don't know what Marc has told you. That's the thing, Carmen. Marc always lies, especially about what he does late at night. Oh, I'm sorry. I shouldn't have come. You're right. You shouldn't have come. But I do have something for you. - You know what? - What is this? That's enough. That's enough. You need to go. I think we should talk. Handle this, or I will. Bye, Toni. Trampy ho. Now, hold on. After all these years, you're still crazy. I'm not crazy. And all of this should have been mine. To my house! Oh! How could you embarrass me like that in front of my guests? Embarrass you? Stop right now, son. I'm trying to calm her down. I am tired of her antics. Every single time, it's another episode! I do not need you stressing her any further than she is right now. No, no. You don't get to talk your way out of this one. Out of what? I heard you on the phone last night! I heard you talking to another woman. Was that her? Did you sleep with her? Did you sleep with her? Yeah. I did. And she's not the only one. Finally. Finally, for once in your life, you want to tell the truth. Maybe I wouldn't have stepped out on our marriage if you weren't constantly having these mental episodes! I hate... I hate you! You know what I am? You know what I am? Toni. I'm done. I am done. - Oh, you're done? - I'm done. You're done? I don't need you anymore. I'm calling Denver, and I'm drawing up the papers. Uh-uh. I hate you! You stupid bitch! You could have killed him! Shut up! I hate you! Come on, baby. Marc! What, Marc? Hold up. Hold on. I just need to... What do you want, Nicole? You know that's not all her fault. You're kidding me, right? Come on, Marc. You got this drop dead gorgeous woman drooling all over you. Of course she figured it out. What did you expect? You can't have your cake and eat it, too. You need to mind your business and stay out of mine. Fine. I want to talk to you about Victor. I'm not gonna talk to you about our business. You're not his wife, and you're not mine. So you don't need to know. Oh my God. Grandma, it smells so good. You know you don't have to do this, right? I do have Maggie. Honey, can't nobody cook better than your grandma. I can't argue with that. How are you feeling this morning? I'm OK. I just have this migraine headache. Have you seen Marc? No. You check his office? Yeah, wasn't there. Checked the guest bedroom, too. Baby, can I be frank with you? Yeah. I saw something in you last night I don't like. I know. I know. I'm just fed up. I can understand that. But you can't keep mixing alcohol with your meds. I know. Trust me. It only made it worse. Is that Marc? No, it's just a reminder. Toni, what's going on? Hey, Victor. Have you talked to Marc? No, I haven't. He... he missed our monthly board meeting this morning. What? He never misses a meeting. Yeah, I know. He's... he's probably just blowing off some steam. Can you have him call me as soon as you talk to him, please? OK. OK. I will. I'm sure he's fine. OK. Hey, girl. Hey, girl. How are you feeling? Hmm. Stressed, disrespected. Yeah. Hurt. All the above. Can you believe I haven't talked to Marc all day? I bet he's with another woman. Probably that Carmen trick. I'm surprised you ain't hit her. You know I bopped her. No, you didn't. Got her right in her throat. I should have bopped her. Had the nerve to show up at my house. Do you think he was serious about the divorce? I don't know. But we ain't never had a fight like that before. I mean, you know we argue, we fight. But we work through it. I just need him to come back. Y'all two always pull through. You know, his ego might be bruised a little bit, but he gonna call you. He ain't stupid. That part. Hello, Carmen? Yes, this is she. This is Marc's wife. Oh, I didn't expect to hear from you so soon. Have you seen my husband? Is he with you? Oh, hold on 1 second. Hey, Marc. Are you here? Marc, are you... are you there? Look, I don't have time for games, OK? This is serious. Look, I don't have time for you questioning me about a husband that you clearly do not know how to take care of. Bitch. You don't know what I know how to take care of. Your marital problems are not my problems, OK? Bitch! Mrs. Carter, I'm Detective McKenzie. Thank you. Hi. This is Detective Anderson. Hello. So your husband, Marc Carter, is missing? Yes. I haven't seen him or spoken to him in two days. No one else has heard from him, not even his mother. Well, it says here that he owns a boat and it's missing, too. Perhaps he's just taken a trip. No. Something's wrong. OK, one thing I know about my husband, he's consistent. He wouldn't just leave his company. His company is everything. OK, Mrs. Carter. Why don't we start with a list of people that we should contact, a description of the boat, and we can put out a missing persons bulletin. OK? What do you think? Well, I'm pretty certain that a highly successful man doesn't just vanish into thin air. Let's start with the missing boat. I'm with you. This doesn't make any sense. Marc would never just disappear. I know. Well, what did Toni say when she called you? That Marc hadn't been seen since the night of the party. What took her so long to call the police? I don't know. I don't believe her. She's lying. London, please! Mom, you know that she's a nutcase. I wouldn't put anything past her. Come on. Calm down. I'm just saying. McKenzie. Yeah. What? You found the boat? Where? Chesapeake Marina? All right, I'll be right there. Come on, baby. Answer, please. I don't know what's going on. Toni. Victor. I don't know what to do. It's been days. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. It's OK. It's OK. It's gonna be OK. Sorry. I didn't mean for you to see me like this. It's OK. It's OK. This view is so gorgeous. I remember when Marc first found this place, how happy he was. Hmm. Yeah, I remember when he was telling me he wanted a place of serenity. And then he found this place. And it was perfect. Hey, uh, the detectives are back at the house. Do they have any news? I... I don't know. I came right out to get you. Come on, let's go. Detective McKenzie, did you find Marc? Toni, honey. I need you to come sit down. - Why? - It... Why? What's wrong? Who... who are you? I'm Detective Anderson. And we found your husband's boat about 25 miles from your house. It was docked at the Chesapeake Marina. Yeah? Where is he? Mrs. Carter, a body washed up on the shore, and we've confirmed it is indeed your husband. No! No, no, no, no, no, no, no! No, you're lying! No! You did this. No, no, no, no! You killed my brother! Ugh! I loved Marc! You stupid bitch! You stupid bitch! Stop. You only wanted him for his money! Stop. His money! No, I didn't. I want to live so God can use me. I want to live so God can use me. Any time, any... any way... Goodbye, little bro. You'll forever be in my heart. Oh, my Lord, I want to live. I want to live so God can use me. Anybody want to live? Any time... Check this out. Autopsy confirms homicide. Question is, who had motive? I mean, the guy was rich. I'm sure he pissed a few people off. OK, so the primary people we start with are the wife, business partner, and the sister. But only because she had money ties. Yeah, but Marc Carter was a man of means with expensive taste. Mm-hmm. I'd be very surprised if he didn't have more mistresses than Carmen here. Mistresses have been known to kill. Yeah, but fortunately for this eyepiece, her alibi checks out. OK. So what do we got? We got love. Mm-hmm. Money. And what? Possible jealousy? Which means they all have motives. Right. So where do you want to start? Hmm. I'll start with the company first. - Yeah. - See what I find. What about Mr. Carter as a person? Were you two close? He had a lot of admirers. I just wasn't one of them. And not like that. He was my boss. He was my mentor. That's it. The last time I talked to Marc was at the anniversary party. We had a little disagreement, and I stepped away to grab a drink. Witnesses at the party say it was pretty intense. "Intense" is such a strong word, Detective. More like, had a little heat to it. So what was the disagreement about? Just business. So these admirers of his, did he ever get involved with any of them? Mr. Carter loved women. I hated it for Toni, because she really loved him. He just treated her like some status symbol. Is it true that you and Marc weren't on the same page about selling Holden Gaming? We were in discussions. Well, from my understanding, there was $200 million on the line that Marc was shooting down. Now, Victor, that's a lot of money to lose. I don't like what you're insinuating, Detective. Just make your point. Well, I'm just doing my due diligence, Victor. And to be frank, you're one of the people who had the most to gain from Mr. Carter's death. Marc and I were best friends. We started this business from scratch. Yet you argued about selling it. Was Mrs. Carter aware of any of these indiscretions? We all knew. It... it was an open secret. I remember she came in one day, and she was screaming about some email that she'd found. The whole office heard her. The walls were shaking. Really? How long ago was this? Maybe a year ago. But nothing like that has happened since. Marc got into arguments with a lot of different people. He was stubborn like that. That's just who he was. Now, five minutes after I stepped away, Toni was coming at him about something else. So from your point of view, how was the business doing? It was good. We doubled the company's revenue in the last year. I don't know what we're gonna do now that he's gone. One last question. Where were you 2:00 AM, the night of the party? I was at home, making love to my beautiful fiancée. Really? Any more questions? Well, thank you for your time. Sorry, Denver. Had to get myself together. No problem. Sorry for the, uh, short notice. I just needed to get everyone under one roof. OK, let's get started. "I, Marc Devon Carter, being of sound mind," do hereby declare this document to be my last will and testament, and hereby revoke any and all other wills heretofore made by me. I appoint Denver Lawson to serve as the personal representative of my estate, and he will work directly with my wife, Toni Kathleen Carter, to make all business decisions pertaining to my business properties and finances totaling $25 million. If for any reason Toni Carter is deemed unfit to make decisions, Denver will serve as the conservator of the estate and Toni's rights will temporarily pass "to my mother, Doris Carter." Wait a minute. So you're saying if Toni is deemed crazy, Mom makes the decision in her place? London, stop. Is that what you want, London? You and your mom to run my estate? Marc's estate. Ladies, please. I'll be glad to answer any questions once I've finished. Uh, wait, wait, wait, wait. Um, what's this here on page 6? About a holding period before we can even begin discussions on selling Holden? So there's a 60 day holding period after death in which the company cannot be sold. After that time, if Miss Carter is interested, then you can enter into negotiations regarding sale of the company. So I need both of their signatures? That is correct. I'm just here to act on Marc's wishes. Don't shoot the messenger. Ahem. Toni, there are parties interested in buying holding for a minimum of $200 million. I'm not ready, Victor. Marc just died, for God's sake. He didn't die. He was murdered. At least get that part straight. Bitch, you got one more time to try me. Toni, baby, listen. We know you've been dealing with mental issues. Maybe you should consider letting me handle my business until you get better. I've been running the business behind the scenes for years. I know what I'm doing. Oh, now the gold-digger thinks she knows what she's doing. Gold-digger? Let me tell you something. Oh, here we go. You never respected me as his wife. You always want him to choose between me and you. And he chose me, his wife. And if it wasn't for me honoring him, I would completely cut you out. Toni, look. I didn't mean anything by it. I just wanted to make sure you were well enough to handle things. Miss Doris, I'm fine. I will not be relinquishing my rights. And I know Marc left you completely taken care of. So I suggest you take whatever he gave you and leave me the hell alone. Now, I'm gonna leave before I say something I might regret. And the rest of you can see your way out. We'll handle this tomorrow, Mr. Lawson. Toni's beginning to give us some real problems. And you were supposed to be working on her. That is easier said than done. She is a mess over Marc. I'm afraid she's gonna have another blackout or something. Yeah, well, you need to figure it out. And fast. Or we gonna lose this deal. And I'm not having that. I've been trying to get away from this company and Marc for years. And even from the grave, he's still making it hard for me! What exactly do you want me to do? I want you to play your damn position! All right? Either get Toni on board with selling, or get her fully committed. I know if you get Toni committed, I can get Miss Doris on board. And all you need is Toni and Denver to sign? Yeah. Yeah, that's it. I think I can make something happen, if you can get Miss Doris to sign. Oh, I will. Then we'll be $200 million richer. Come here, girl. August Washington? Who's asking? My name is Detective McKenzie. I'm investigating the murder of Marc Carter. You have a moment to speak with me? Yeah, sure. When was the last time you saw the deceased? At the anniversary party. But it wasn't for long. I had to leave early. You have anyone who can back up your alibi? I do. Do you know anyone who would have wanted to see Mr. Carter dead? Man, I'm... I'm... I'm just a landscaper. All right. I mind my business. I do my job. And Mr. Carter... I'm sorry... the deceased, paid me on time. OK. But if you think of anything else, please, give me a call. Absolutely will. Ahem. Mm-mm. The last time I mixed alcohol with my meds, it was bad. Well, that's the point. After the week you had, you deserve a little drink. A little wine ain't gonna hurt nothing. No. OK. Victor told me the reading of the will got a little rough. Especially with that bitch, London. I can't stand her. Have you spoken to your doctor? Yeah. I speak to him every day. He gave me sleeping pills. It makes me feel like a zombie. Then I got Victor pressuring me about selling Marc's company. I mean, if Marc were alive, I'd probably be begging him to sell the company. But I... he's not, and I need time. Look, if you sell, you can get a fresh start. You don't owe nobody no explanations for doing what's best for you. Aren't you a piece of work? Speak of the damn devil. What are you doing in my house? I see you still plotting how to get even more money out of my dead brother. Get the hell out of my house. I know you killed him. And I'm not gonna stop until your ass is locked up! I didn't kill nobody, but I do know you better get out my house! Or what? Listen, you got a lot of nerve coming up in here accusing Toni. She loved Marc. Please, she loved his money! Oh, and you didn't? Weren't you always begging him for a loan, begging him for some money, get your damn hair braided? You don't know nothing about me! - We know you ain't got no hair. - Shut up! I know you a leech. That's what I know. And I know the only reason Marc ever gave you anything is because he felt sorry for your little pathetic ass! You're pathetic, pining for a man that had a vasectomy behind your back. He was never gonna have kids with your crazy ass! What? Bitch, slow down. Hey! Wait, wait! You stupid bitch! You cut me! Toni. Toni? Toni, I'm gonna have to call 911. We can figure this out. Toni, it's OK. You're safe. You're safe. Where am I? When I got the call, I had them bring you here, to the New Haven Mental Facility. What? What's the last thing you remember? Um, I remember having lunch. And London showed up. And... Do you remember anything else? No, I must have... I must have blacked out. Where... why... why are my hands in restraints? Last night, you attacked your sister-in-law with a knife. No. No, I didn't. I did not... Let me out of here. Get me out of here! It's OK. It's OK. What do you mean, it's OK? Let me out. Everything is gonna be fine, OK? We're just going to have one of the nurses give you... - No! - Hold her down. No! Give her the shot. Go ahead, go ahead. Doctor, thanks for coming down tonight. Of course. Don't mention it. So how is Mrs. Carter feeling? She's fragile. I mean, she doesn't remember the incident, but with time she will. Hmm. So what can you tell me about her state of mind before the incident? Miss Carter suffers from depression and anxiety, which is not uncommon. But it is uncommon to attack someone with a knife. Well for someone like Toni, who lives this perfect life in the public eye, to deal with the deep pain that she carries can be overwhelming. Now, in the past she has resorted to cutting as a means to ease the pain and gain back a sense of control. Well, has she ever attacked anyone before? You know, become violent? Not to my knowledge. She's much more likely to engage in self-harm. Now, the incident with her sister-in-law, that was an extreme response. Doctor, I'm gonna have to speak with Mrs. Carter, ask her some questions. When she's more stable, we could definitely arrange that. Dr. Franklin, this is a murder investigation. I understand, but my duty is to my patient first. It's important that I keep the stresses around Toni down to a minimum. We do that, then I think we'll be able to take questions. Can't believe you got her fully committee. What was I supposed to do? She tried to kill herself. I'm actually scared for her. So maybe you should have let her die. I mean, that way I'd be able to sell the company. I can't believe you just said that. It's true. It's true, OK? OK? Getting her committed is not enough. She hasn't been deemed incapable. I need her rights to the company. What do you want me to do? I already got her put in! You know what you need to do. I'm not making you no promises. I can't convince people to do things they don't want to do. Figure it out! Because if you don't do whatever you've got to do to get them signatures, I'll tell your best friend that you were sleeping with her husband behind her back. You're an asshole. Yeah. Yeah, but what would you be without me? Drive. Hey, Miss Doris. It's so good to see you. Come on in, Victor. How are you? All right. Uh, is... is London around? No, she stepped out. What's on your mind? Um, look, I... I know you must feel angry at the way Toni came at London, but I'm really worried about her. It would break Marc's heart, seeing them like that. I remember when Holden first blew up. Marc made me promise him that if anything ever happened to him, that... To make sure that his family was taken care of. Now, I can't help Toni, but I can make sure you and London are OK. What do you mean? Look, there's... there's nothing more that I want for Toni than for her to be OK. But right now she's... She's just too unstable. This is about selling the company, isn't it? Look, right now the offer on the table is a good one. Oh, OK, and I know you worry about London. I know. But this way... this way you two will be taken care of for life. Victor, you and I both know Marc didn't want to sell. Yeah, but he also thought he would be here to help run the company. Look, all... all I'm saying is if... is if Toni gets deemed too unfit, OK, I want us to be able to work together to make the best decision for everyone. Just... just think about it. If the time comes, we'll talk about it then. OK. OK, good enough. Good enough. Denver, so good to see you. You too. I was worried about you. How are you doing, love? Better. I'm scared, though. The doctor extended my stay, so I can deal with the outside world. I can... I can only imagine, with everything that you've been through. Listen, I... I'm sorry to bring this up, but we need to talk about Marc's family and Victor. What happened? Let's just say that I need you to get out of here, because both Victor and London have reached out to me about getting you deemed unfit to make decisions. I expected it from London. Victor? That's a blow. Toni, I think they're gonna do anything they can to keep you here. I know. Listen, get me out of here. Please. Denver, you cannot let them take Marc's part of the company. Please. Don't worry. I won't let them take what's rightfully yours. You need anything, I'll be right outside the door. Thank you, Doctor. Mrs. Carter. Detective. I hope you're feeling better. I am. I understand you wanted to talk to me about my husband's case. Yes. How were things between you and your husband? Things were good. I know your husband had some indiscretions. You're talking about the other women. Every marriage has its problems. Well I'm sure that made you angry. It did. But it didn't make me want to kill him. I loved him. Did you? I did. Is it true that you and Marc were getting a divorce? I know what you're thinking, but I didn't kill him. Well, then who did, Mrs. Carter? Did you talk to Victor? I know he wanted to sell the company, and Marc was completely against it. His alibi checks out, Mrs. Carter. Right now, you're out number one suspect. I loved him. We were planning to start a family. A family? According to your husband's medical records, he had a vasectomy. No. Yes. No. No, you're lying. - Mrs... - You're lying. Mrs. Carter! No, no, no! Calm down. Dr. Franklin! You're lying. You're lying! Dr. Franklin! You're lying! He didn't! No, no, no! Restrain her, restrain her! No, no, there's no way! I didn't do it. I didn't kill my husband! Wait, wait! Please, no! No, no, no, no! No way. No, I didn't do it. I didn't do it! Nicole, I thought this was a business meeting. Oh, it is a business meeting. Cocktail? Sure. So why are you here? Toni. What about her? Oh, you haven't heard? Heard what? She had a meltdown when Detective McKenzie went to go question her. She had to be restrained. Wow. What are you doing? I'm calling Dr. Franklin. I need to check on Toni. She's in a place with doctors all around her. She'll be fine. Uh, what are you doing? Trying to have a conversation. I'm listening. We both know that Toni is not fit right now. Nicole, she has not been declared unfit to make decisions. I know. As you know, Holden has a big deal on the table. I can't sign for Toni. You know that. Denver, Toni trusts you. You can convince her to sign before we lose this deal. We? Look, there's a lot for everybody to benefit here. It's $200 million. You don't really think I wouldn't let you get a piece of that pie? That is, unless you like pie. Baby, I know this is rough. But you're gonna get through it. It's so hard, Grandma. I'm trying to keep it together. And you will. You will. Your mother suffered with the same issues. Depression and anxiety had her all over the place. Mama killed herself. Honey, she refused to get help. You didn't. Now, I have talked to Dr. Franklin every day, and he says you're doing really well. Baby, you've been through a lot. And you know I'm gonna get you the best help. I love you, Grandma. Sweetie. Thank you. I brought you a friendly face with me today. You two catch up while I go talk to the doctor. Baby, I love you. They're all just pawns, honey. Hey. Hey, August. So good to see you. I have more, but um, they wouldn't let me bring him in. So I snuck this one in for you. So sweet. Well, I'd like to see a smile on your face. So I got the books that you wanted. Thank you. So I mean, how have you... how have you been? I mean, you... you look better. Honestly I'm scared. They think I did it. Hey, hey, hey. Don't... don't... don't worry about that. That... that'll never stick, I know you didn't do this. Toni, I... I know you. Anything you need me to do, I'll do it. Thank you, Mrs. Carter, for meeting with me again. I want to do whatever I can to help solve my husband's case. OK. Tell me about the fight you had the night of the party. It was stupid, really. Um, honestly, I just let my jealousy take hold. I... he invited somebody to the party I thought he was sleeping with. I mixed my alcohol with meds, and I fell asleep. All night. I see. This is your husband's boat, correct? Yes. It is that blood? Mrs. Carter, your husband was bludgeoned to death with a blunt object and thrown overboard. Oh my God. Why would somebody do that? Toni, this was an impulsive act, unplanned, the kind of thing a person does out of anger. Do you know who this is? No. Looks a lot like you. That's not me. You're sure? Yes, it's not me. Recognize this? Yes. Marc gave me that bracelet. I was wearing it the night of the party. Where did you get it? Mrs. Carter, it was found on the boat. Detective, someone is trying to set me up. Who, Mrs. Carter? Who? Victor, I told you that. His alibi checks out! Take a seat. Let me prove it. Please. Just exactly how are you going to help me prove it? Nicole. Nicole is covering for Victor. If you just let me call Nicole, I can prove it! I'm not sure that's advisable. Please, I have to do this! If Victor is the murderer, that means Nicole is in danger. Detective McKenzie, I have to call her. Please. I can prove it! Nicole, I'm freaking out. No, you have to come up here. No, it has to be now. It's about Victor. Oh, my goodness. Toni. Oh, you look awful. You OK? Thanks. Exactly what I need to hear right now. I'm sorry. I didn't mean that. What's going on? You sounded frantic on the phone. Nicole, I'm so scared. They think I killed Marc. But... no, you could never do that. I know. That's what I told them. But they're not Listening. Nicole, I got to tell you something. Baby, what is it? I know you love Victor. And I know he was best friends with Marc. But I think he did it. What do you mean? I think he killed Marc. Well, maybe... maybe he hired someone to do it. I don't know. I'm not sure. Toni, that is the craziest thing you've ever said. I know it sounds crazy. But think about it. Victor was the only one that had something to gain from Marc's death. And he had the means to do it. I think he killed Marc. And now he's trying to frame me. Toni, Victor was with me that night. I know he didn't do it. We went straight home after the party, and I know he didn't leave. I know you're trying to protect Victor, but you don't have to protect him. I got to tell you, Doc, this isn't looking too good for your patient. Just give it a second. See how this plays out. This is awful for you, and that you are still in deep grief over Marc, but... But it's taking you to extremes. Girl, listen to yourself. Oh, fuck. Oh my God. You're right. I just miss him. And I just keep thinking about how awful I was to him sometimes. And how I didn't appreciate that he was trying. He knows that you loved him. OK? Even... even with all of his faults. Do you still have that bracelet that I gave you at the party? Oh, now, this is interesting. It's the only thing I have left that Marc tried to give to me that I didn't appreciate. Of course I still have it. You gave it to me. Oh my God. Thank God. Can I have it back, please? Why? You practically threw it at me. Yeah, I was being spiteful. I was angry. That's the one thing I have left that Marc gave to me. Because everything else he gave you wasn't good enough for you, huh? Why are you so angry? It is always about you, isn't it? Nicole, I'm just trying to... You had the perfect life, but that wasn't enough for you. You had a gorgeous husband who adored you. But you couldn't support his dreams. No, you wanted him to cater to your every whim. Hell, you want everybody in here to cater to your every whim. I begged Marc to leave you, but he wouldn't. What? You heard me. All you did was whine about everything. So this is the one thing you will not get back, because that bracelet should have been mine in the first place. Um, you mean you and Marc? Me and Marc. Marc and I had been seeing each other for over a year. He couldn't deal with your crazy ass. I consoled him. I was his relief from the wife he didn't want kids with. If it wasn't for his crazy devotion for you, he'd still be alive. That's a confession. Ugh. I'm gonna be sick. Toni, before I walk out of here and never talk to you again, I want you to know the truth. It wasn't Victor. It was you. We spent so many nights out there on that boat. When he drove away, I knew he was going to our spot at Chesapeake Marina. So I drove over here and I got on board. God, Nicole, how could you? I didn't mean to. I tried to reason with him. I told him he could just sell the company and we could run off together. But he didn't listen. And then he had the nerve to bring his other side piece to the party. Nicole. I just... I... I snapped. And I grabbed that fire extinguisher, and I hit him in his entitled face. And when he went down, I hit him again. But I didn't mean to kill him. I loved him, too. I gave so much to him, but every time I did, he just chose you. Shit! Nobody's gonna believe you, you crazy bitch! Thank you for killing my husband for me. You did me a favor, bestie! Toni. Toni, enough, enough! No! Go to jail, bitch! No, no! Go to jail, bitch! Rest. Rest, Toni. Just calm down. How'd you know? The bracelet. Sent. I don't have to fake it, so I guess I won't need these anymore. Ah. Let's go, my queen. Let's go. And you need to check those accounts. My brother was a millionaire. I know there's something in there. Sorry, ma'am. I've checked the account several times. The account is at 0. It's been closed. Have a good day. What did she do? Now that we got that out of the way. Exactly. Now give me some. - Toni. - Take it off. No. Anything you need me to do, I'll do it. Is that Marc? No, it's just a reminder. Mrs. Carter has a proposition for you. I want it bad. I want a piece of you. Diamonds and things, without any strings. If it ain't about money, then what's it about? Stick to the plan. There's too much to count. I need a trophy. I need a trophy wife. I need a trophy. I need a trophy. I need a trophy wife. I need a trophy. It ain't about money, then what's it about? Stick to the plan. There's too much to count. I want it bad. I want a piece of you. Diamonds and things, without any strings. If it ain't about money, then what's it about? This is the thing. There's too much to count. I need a trophy. I need a trophy wife. I need a trophy. I need a trophy. I need a trophy wife. I need a trophy. If it ain't about money, then what's it about? Stick to the plan. It's too much to count. I don't even know who to trust. Money can make your adrenaline rush. Even your family be doing too much. You want to love, OK for lust. I ride alone when I'm traveling to places. Want me a ship, but I had to be patient. Then they forget all the bread you was breaking. I said, whatever I came with it, I'm taking it. They want what I have, and want what I got. I try to be clutch. I'm rich and I'm cut. This shit's like a movie, thick is the plot. You say you love me. I hear that a lot. However silent, time to favor. We'll shoot for the street. It's too late to savor. I got the cheat code. I got the data. If it ain't about money, I'll talk to you later.
