(children chattering) - [Child] Oh, shut up! (children chattering) - [Boy] Let me show you (mumbles). - [Boy] Oh yeah? Well, your mother looks excited. (children chattering) (film projector clicking) - [Child] It is not! It's not. - [Child] Yes you are! - [Child] Hey, I think it's starting. (children cheering) - [Child] It's starting. (dramatic orchestral music) - Quiet, quiet, quiet! - Sh! (children chattering) - [Children] Sh! - [Child] I don't need to. (children chattering) - Come on! - Sh! (suspenseful orchestral music) (children chattering) (Yellow Hair grunts) (children cheering) - Cowboy. - [Child] Yeah, that's right, Yellow Hair! (children cheering) - [Children] Pecos! Pecos! Pecos! Pecos! Pecos! Pecos! Pecos! (children cheering) (children chattering) (children laughing) (dramatic orchestral music) Boo! Boo! Boo! (suspenseful orchestral music) (children applauding) (children chattering) - [Child] Sh, she's mysterious. - [Child] Shayowteewah. (children chattering) (boy whistles) - [Boy] Oh boy. (children chattering) (ominous orchestral music) (upbeat orchestral music) (suspenseful orchestral music) (horse hooves clomping) (rope whooshes) (horse whinnies) (rider cries out) (ominous music) (horse hooves clomping) (horses whinnying) (man cries out) (man grunting) (dramatic orchestral music) (bones snapping) (men murmuring) (gun fires) (men shouting in foreign language) (gun fires) (statue creaking) (statue crashes) (horses whinnying) (stones thudding) (guns firing) (men chattering) (stones thudding) (rider grunts) (men cry out) (horses whinny) (guns firing) (men chattering in foreign language) (upbeat orchestral music) (men cry out) (arrows whoosh) (man grunts) (stones thudding) (man groans) (suspenseful orchestral music) (arrow whooshes) (dramatic orchestral music) (suspenseful orchestral music) (dramatic orchestral music) (man cries out) - Help! (flesh sizzling) (man grunting) - I could beat you. (man groaning) (suspenseful orchestral music) (man grunting) (melted metal zapping) (melted metal bubbling) (metal clanks) (fist thuds) (Pecos grunts) - Keep this up, we're gonna give this wall a hell of a headache. (groans) Besides, is this any way for business partners to be treatin' each other? - I think I'm being very generous. I could have my men shoot you just for being here in Mexican territory. But out of the goodness of my heart, I let you live. For now. - Colonel, I swear to you, I didn't know there were gonna be any warriors there when I gave you that map. - There was no temple! Flores here lost most of his men and barely escaped himself. - Gosh, compadre, I'm real sorry about that. Come on, fellas, let's have us a drink, try to figure out where Mr. Flores here went wrong. (foot thuds) (Pecos grunts) All right, let's not. - You told me there was gold in an Aztec temple, but you didn't told me everything. Did you? - I swear I did. You tellin' me you didn't find any gold at all? Is that a yes or a no? (Flores grunts) (fist thuds) This fella don't talk a whole lot, does he? (whip snaps) - Your jokes are not funny, mi amigo. Now tell me, what are you keeping from us about the yellow treasure? Or maybe the old lady didn't told you everything. - Grey Cloud? Not a chance. I've known her all my life. She raised me like I was her own. I'll bet she told me that story of the yella treasure a hundred times. - Perhaps she lied. - Apaches don't lie. Maybe Flores here just didn't look for it right. (Flores grunts) - No! You can have him later. Now you and I talk. (gate creaking) Flores, bring me this woman, Grey Cloud. We will make one of them talk. (speaking in foreign language) - Colonel! Indians! Heading this way! They're Aztecas! (somber flute music) - [Soldier] Look. (men chattering in foreign language) - There they are. - How many are there? - Over there. - Yes. - Look. (soldiers chattering) - [Torres] Open the gate! - [Sergeant] Open the gate! (ominous music) (men chattering in foreign language) (speaking in foreign language) - Those masks, they look like Buckwheat and Manuel. - Look, look what they did to their faces. (dramatic orchestral music) (suspenseful orchestral music) (Indian whooping) - Shoot, shoot! (gun firing) (bullets whistling) Why are you waiting? Fire! Fire, you idiots! (guns firing) That's what the guns are for. (guns firing) - Aim higher! Raise your sights. They are too far, Colonel. (guns firing) - I can see that, Sergeant. Stop firing. (guns firing) These Indians are smart. I said stop firing! - Stop! Hold your fire! - Those Indians. They don't have guns but they know how to make them useless. Indians. Indians! (Indians whooping) You Indians. Barbarians! All of you! Sergeant. - [Sergeant] Si, senor. - Take a whip to that man. I want to hear him scream. (somber flute music) (whip cracking) (grunts) Cross the border and go to reservation alone. (whip cracks) And bring me the old woman, Flores. I do not care how, just bring her. (whip cracking) (soft orchestral music) (Yellow Hair grunting) (Yellow Hair groaning) (foot thuds) (men laughing) (fighters grunting) (Yellow Hair cries out) (man grunts) (foot thuds) (man grunts) - (murmuring) Pecos (murmuring). - Ya! Ya. Ya! Ya. Ya. - Some day you make wrong move and brave will beat you. - And then he'll grab me by the hair, drag me to his bed, and finally Grey Cloud can have her grandchildren. - [Grey Cloud] It is Apache way, Yellow Hair. - I'm not all Apache. My white blood says I don't wanna belong to a man just because he beat me in a fight. - Why you hate men? Grey Cloud have reason, not you. I was the one raped. No man has harmed you. - All who look upon me frown. Is that not harm enough? - Pecos in Mexico. He is in cage again like animal. - He's just tired of tastin' the dust on the reservation. Has a hunger for gold. - He looks for gold below border. (soft suspenseful music) - He said he was bound for Mexico this time. What's the matter? (suspenseful tribal music) - Only three stones of gold. One is missing. I need four winds of the spirit to carry my soul. They are my sacred gift for the journey through death. Without them the spirit can not free itself. - If The Kid has taken it, Grey Cloud, it's because he's not Apache. He doesn't understand. - [Grey Cloud] (gasps) He take sacred horn. - The one with the map on it? - It is my fault. I fill his head with Tulapan stories. Like coyote he never stand still. I'm afraid he goes for the yellow treasure. - Not as long as he's behind bars - Get him out. You will find help at the fort. - Maybe I'll just leave him there and bring back the nugget and horns. - No! We must talk, he and I. To look for Tulapan gold is great danger. Bring him quickly. I must tell him truth. It is time to tell you both truth. (suspenseful orchestral music) - Ya, ah! (soft ominous music) - Note the bouquet and the color of the wine. It is very important to appreciate the finer things of life if you wish to become an officer. Don't gulp it, just roll it gently on your tongue as if it were a great treasure. - [Soldier] Give us a little. Gracias. (door creaks) (metal scraping) - [Yellow Hair] Kid? - Yellow? - We're goin' home. - I can't. - Why can't you? - Because, darlin'. Not just yet anyway. - Don't call me darlin'. I ain't one of your dance hall girls. - Grey Cloud wants you. - Tell her I'll be home in a couple of days. There's somethin' here I gotta lay my hands on first. - Is it the nugget? - Nugget? I don't know nothin' about no nugget. - Yeah, sure. You stole the horn, too, didn't you? - Look, I only borrowed for a spell. Will you get outta here before you mess everything up? - I told Grey Cloud I was gonna get you outta here and that's just what I'm gonna do. Here. (metal clanks) - Yellow, you're wastin' your time. Ain't nothin' gonna make me move 'til I'm ready. (fuse hissing) (metal clanks) I'm ready! (Pecos whimpers) Don't breathe. (explosion booms) Ah. - Ya! Ha, ha! (playful music) - Don't just stand there, get back to your post. (whimpers) - [Yellow Hair] Ha! Ha, ha! Ha, ha! (Pecos coughing) - What am I doing here? Trapped in this God forsaken desert among scorpions, fools, and-- (bell clanging) (men chattering in foreign language) - Ya, ah! Whoa, whoa. Ho. (dramatic orchestral music) - Couldn't you just have found the keys? - Come on, let's get outta here before we wake everybody up. - First, I gotta get that horn from the colonel. (man grunts) (speaking in foreign language) - Close the gate! Don't even think about it. What's your name? (chattering) - You're gonna get your butt shot off! (gun firing) - [Sergeant] Stop shooting! (guns firing) - Ha, ha! (guns firing) (speaking in foreign language) - Stop firing! (gun firing) Spread out. (gun firing) Stop firing! Stop firing! You fools. (guns firing) (speaking in foreign language) (guns firing) (bright orchestral music) Everybody out! Hurry. (men shouting) (explosion booms) (gun firing) - Come now, remove it. - This colonel's a tough guy to get to see. (horse whinnies) - Okay, I'll fix it, but only because I don't wanna have to bury you. Ya! - Yellow. Yellow! (gun firing) Yellow! (gun firing) (explosion booms) (soldier cries out) (door creaks) - Find the gringo prisoner! Everybody spread out (gun clicks) and find him. (Colonel Torres laughing) - I got him. I got him, Sergeant. (laughs) Stop searching, I got him! - [Sergeant] In the stables. - Stop searching! - Everywhere. - Idiots, stop searching. I got the prisoner! I tell you, I may be surrounded by the deaf and the stupid, Kid, but I didn't make colonel by losing prisoners. (chuckles) When I get through with you this time-- - Colonel! He had help, a woman. - Well, where is she? (whimpers) - [Yellow Hair] Hello, there. (Colonel Torres whimpering) - Hold it. - Oh please, please be careful. - Gonna be really smart to do like I say, don't ya think? - Oh yes. - Uh-huh. Uh-huh, good, - Yes, yes. Yes, yes, yes. Yes, yes, yes. (whimpers) - Now get movin'. (Colonel Torres whimpers) That's it. Slow and easy. Careful now. - Yellow, you're just like an angel. - Where are you going? - [Pecos] I've still gotta get the-- - This? - Hey, girl, gimme that. - Tell 'em to get us a wagon. - I, I, I. - You gimme the nugget. - I ain't got the nugget. Had to give it to somebody. Gimme the horn. - No, it's not yours. You stole it. Tell him. - It's not yours, you stole it. - The wagon! - Aye! Give 'em anything they want! - Do it. - Darlin', I told ya. I just borrowed that. I'll give it back. - Quit callin' me darlin'! - Don't call her darling. (whimpering) (horse hooves clomping) (wagon rattling) - Let me just hold it. - Which? - The horn. (chuckles) You got enough on your hands. - Not hardly. - No need to insult me, senorita. - Shut up. (Colonel Torres whimpers) - This is unpleasant. - Well it's no picnic for me either. - [Driver] Whoa, whoa. (Colonel Torres cries out) (soldiers laughing) - Be still! How dare you. There's nothing to laugh about. - Ha, ha! (Colonel Torres whimpering) (speaking in foreign language) - Whoa, whoa, whoa. (Colonel Torres whimpering) - Hold it. (Colonel Torres whimpering) - Shame we weren't rightly introduced! - On the contrary, senorita, I feel like we are very close friends. Shoot them! Shoot them! Come on. What are you waiting for? - Ha! (bright orchestral music) - Shoot them! Shoot them! What's the matter with you? Open fire! (guns firing) Can't you see they're getting away? Shoot them! There they go. Shoot them! (guns firing) Shoot them! (fuse hissing) (Colonel Torres gasping) Run! Run! (speaking in foreign language) Run! (explosion booms) (crickets chirping) (metal clanking) (ominous music) (Grey Cloud shouts) (Grey Cloud and Flores grunting) (gun fires) (Flores coughs) (Grey Cloud whimpering) - That Flores is a mean one. I'm gonna make him pay for this. - No. Only Apache blood can take revenge. - What are you talkin' about? - The Comanchero is mine. You just get that nugget back. - Come on, Yellow. What good's a nugget gonna do her now? (fist thuds) Okay, there's this girl at the saloon and, well, I gave her the nugget because, well. (somber orchestral music) (chanting in foreign language) - Pecos, Yellow, speak with man who knows. (upbeat music) (saloon patrons chattering) - [Woman In Pink] How elegant. (couple laughs) - [Patron] Hey bartender, set 'em up over here, will ya? (saloon patrons chattering) - [Patron] Bring the bottle of whiskey and set it on the table. (saloon patrons chattering) - Well? - My gal'll be down in just a minute. She's gettin' all gussied for me. (saloon patrons chattering) - [Patron] Hey. Hey! Get over here. (saloon patrons chattering) - Jacks are better. (saloon patrons chattering) - [Man] I can go crazy. - [Yellow Hair] Mm-mm. Hm? - [Patron] Can I get another drink over here, bartender? - [Yellow Hair] Mm-hm. - Yellow, this gentlemen don't take kindly to you interfering in the game. (saloon patrons chattering) - Cards? - Two. - [Pecos] Three. (saloon patrons chattering) - [Card Player] I'm out. - [Gambler] Me, too. (saloon patrons chattering) - Who opened? - [Man In Tan Suit] 200. - I'll call your 200 and I'll raise you $380. - Pecos! Darling! - Hold the fort, amigos, this old boy's got himself a gal and a half to (mumbles). Hi, honey. (Rainbow giggling) (kisses smacking) - No, no, no, put me down, Pecos. Do you wanna mess up my makeup? - You get all prettied up just for me, honey? - Why, who else do you think? - Aww. (sniffing) You smell great. You're one of my two favorite smells. - I don't think I wanna know the other one. My, my, don't you look like a gentleman in that fine suit. Like you was gettin' real successful. - Rainbow, I'm gettin' so close to the big strike, I tell ya, I can feel it in the tips of my fingers. Why there ain't gonna be pockets, or bags, or even chests big enough, honey. - I can't wait 'til you take me outta here. - [Yellow Hair] Has she got the nugget? - Pecos handle this. - What does she know about the nugget? What is she anyway. - Don't you fret none about her, Rainbow. Now, if you'll just gimme that nugget back. - What? - There'll be plenty more later. I just need that one little bitty one right now. - I can't give it to ya. - Why not? - Yellow, will you quit askin' stupid questions? - Why not? - My boss, Mr. Tortuga has it. - And why has he got it? - Well, I had to use it to pay for my room and board on account of you left me here with nothing. - What is the trouble? - He wants the nugget back. - She has expenses here, kid. If she doesn't pay with money, she will have to pay in other ways. - You see, Pecos, I don't wanna have to do that. - Aww. - [Rainbow] I'm a good girl. - Pecos, get your ass over here. - I will. I gotta have that nugget back, mister. - What are you kid, a stinking Indian giver? (saloon patrons chattering) - Let's have that nugget back. - Calm down, Yellow. There ain't no reason we can't work this out, mister. Nobody wants any trouble. We just came-- (knife thuds) - Un-unh. Nothing you didn't ask for. - That's enough. I want that savage out of here. If one day she turns white, bring her back. I'll let her clean my spittoons. - Yeah, Kid, what you'd bring her here for anyway? - Mister, either you hand over that nugget or they're gonna be shippin' you outta here with no place to go but hell. - Get her moving. I wouldn't want to see her tongue cut out. - You want her outta here, mister, you'll have to get her outta here yourself. - Pecos, don't start anything. - All right, if nobody else'll do it, I'll throw the dirty half-breed outta here myself. Come here, you. (gun fires) (man groaning) (man cries out) - The nugget. Now. (suspenseful orchestral music) (gun fires) (metal clanks) (Rainbow screaming) (gun clicks) (suspenseful orchestral music) (guns firing) (Rainbow screaming) (coins jangling) (saloon patrons chattering) (upbeat orchestral music) - Come on, wait a minute, hey! - Shut your trap. Shut up. (Rainbow screaming) Shut it. (hand smacking) (Rainbow grumbles) (Tortuga cries out) - Oh! (saloon patrons chattering) - [Pecos] Hey, that's my money! Hey, that's my money. I had four eights! (saloon patrons chattering) (fists thudding) That's my money! Hey! (gun firing) (fist thuds) - Beat it. Both of you. Before you start trouble. - I got it. - Good. Let's go. Rainbow, honey, I'll get the gold and be back for ya. (Rainbow growls) Ain't that Rainbow somethin'? She's crazy about me, you know that? - [Yellow Hair] Oh yeah. - [Pecos] Hey, what are you doin' with the horn? - Grey Cloud left a message before she died. We gotta go see somebody called the man who knows. - [Pecos] The man who knows? - [Yellow Hair] Come on! - [Pecos] What's he know? (bright orchestral music) - Many years ago, the Spaniards come and try to turn the Tulapan Christian, but Tulapan go hide in the mountain so he can worship what he want, golden gods. A Texan come across this and want to use it to get into the temple to get gold. I thought we were dead for sure when Tulapans find us in canyon, but they just, how do you say? They stare at my partner. They think he's sent by the gods to bring them back to outside world. He smile. He make them smile. They princess smile, too. She fall in love with him. Then the trouble start. - What trouble? - She was to marry the priest, a man named Shayowteewah, but she chose this man. Shayowteewah not like this. - I'll bet. - He have his men blind me so I can not find my way back. Then the princess have a little one and the priest say she dishonored the tribe. He say no to all babies, dear gods forgive. 23 years now, no forgiving. - What do you think happened to your friend and the princess? - Servant woman took the child, run away. - What did they think was so special about your Texan friend? - His hair, it was long and beautiful and yellow. (suspenseful tribal music) - Okay, so you know everything. What do you do with the horn? - Blow it. - Well I'll be darned. - Take to canyon where no echo, temple. - Thanks, mister. Hold on, Yellow. Where do you think you're goin'? - Across the border. I gotta know the truth about me. - You don't even know where the place is. - No, but you do. - Yeah, I do, but if them crazy Tulapans get a hold of ya, there ain't no tellin' what they'll do to ya, and that sure ain't what Grey Cloud wanted. - I don't care what Grey Cloud wanted. I had a real mother and father. She lied to me. (ominous music) (Flores wheezes) - So, they are headed back this way. They might have learned something new about the gold. Bring them to me, and don't be so stupid this time. I want them alive. (Flores grunts) Oh. And God help you if any harms comes to them. Now get out. - Ho. - I'm hungry. - I'm glad to see you can still talk. - Sorry, I just keep thinkin' about the Tulapans, what they're like. - Dangerous. (woman crying) Let's get us a bite to eat, might be our last chance for a bit. (ominous music) (Flores wheezing) (woman crying) (Flores wheezing) - They're not gonna shoot us. (gun clicks) He's only trying to sweat ya. - He's doin' a pretty good job of it. (woman screams) (gun fires) (guns firing) (men laughing) - Now! (fist thuds) - Whoa. (man laughs) - What are you waitin' for? (man groans) Come on! (horn thuds) Ya! (whip cracks) Ya. (suspenseful music) (men chattering) (Flores wheezing) Hurry up. Come on, ya! (men grunting) Ya! (Pecos cries out) (men grunting) Ya! Ha! (men grunting) (ominous music) (henchman cries out) Ya! Ha, ha! - Whoa, whoa. - Hang on! I'll turn! - [Pecos] Oh! - [Yellow Hair] Ya! (upbeat orchestral music) - Yellow, take us to Mexico! - Ya! (upbeat orchestral music) Ha! Ya! Ya, ya, ya! Ya! (henchmen whooping) Ya! - [Henchman] Woohoo! - Ya! Ya! Ya! Ya, ya! Ya! Ya! (henchmen whooping) Ya! - [Pecos] Pirates? (speaking in foreign language) - Ya! (henchmen chattering in foreign language) (henchmen whooping) Ya, come on! (henchman whooping) (henchman cries out) (speaking in foreign language) Ya! (henchmen whistling) Ya! (henchmen whooping) (henchmen whistling) (henchmen chattering) (whip cracking) (henchmen whooping) (whip cracking) - [Henchman] Hey! Stop! - Ya! - Woohoo! - Ya! (whip cracking) Ya! (suspenseful music) (Yellow Hair cries out) - [Henchman] Woohoo! (Yellow Hair grunting) Woohoo! (whooping) (horse hooves pounding) Woohoo! (horse hooves pounding) - Hang on, Yellow! Hang on. That's it, you can do it. Come on. You've got it. Come on, you got it. That's it, that's it! Come on. Gotcha. (chuckles) I gotcha, oh! - Three of a kind! (henchmen whooping) (men chattering) (dramatic orchestral music) - [Henchman] Yahoo! (men chattering) (speaking in foreign language) (peaceful orchestral music) (waves lapping) - Yellow, what are you doin'? - Dryin' off. - I can see that. Trouble is you're naked while you're doin' it. - How come you're complainin'? When you were 13 and I was 10, all you did was tried to take my clothes off. - Yeah, but back then when you were whippin' us at everything, Blue Eagle and I wanted to prove you were really a boy. (horses whinnying) Huh? (horses whinnying) - Hey! - Hey, hey! - Hey! - Hey, whoa! Whoa! - Tulapans. - Look at 'em, like statues. (ominous music) - Aren't they beautiful? - Some dead Comancheros wouldn't reckon so. - No, something tells me these are the most civilized people in the world. - How civilized can they be? They don't even have guns. - They're out of range. - [Pecos] Yeah, they're tricky all right. - Feel it? - Feel what? - I don't know, it's just strange. - Yeah, it's gonna take more 'n a bunch of savages to scare me. (ominous music) (Pecos and Yellow Hair panting) (horse whinnies) (soft suspenseful music) Come on, Yellow, get a move on! What's the matter with you? What's the matter with you anyway? (ominous orchestral music) Let's rest here a second. My feet are killin' me. How 'bout you? (dramatic orchestral music) It's like these Tulapans wasn't chasin' us at all, like they was gettin' us right where they want us. What do ya think? Yellow, what do ya think? - I don't know. - Well, I'm wore out. Maybe we oughta just give 'em the horn, huh? (soft suspenseful music) Maybe then they'll leave us alone. (snake rattling) (ominous music) (Pecos cries out) (Yellow Hair grunting) - Ya! (dramatic orchestral music) (snake rattling) (snakes rattling) - Now they've gone too far. - I thought you were fearless. - I am, except for snakes. (gun fires) (snakes rattling) (gun firing) (snakes rattling) (gun firing) - You're gonna run out of shells! - That's probably what they want. - I know what they want. (dramatic orchestral music) (gun firing) (snakes rattling) - Yellow! Yellow. Crazy. (Pecos grunting) (ominous orchestral music) What are you doin'? They'll kill you! I think. (soft orchestral music) (suspenseful orchestral music) (horn bellowing) (horn bellowing) (horn bellow echoing) (horn bellowing) (horn bellow echoing) (horn bellowing) (rocks rattling) (soft suspenseful music) (ominous orchestral music) Yellow! (suspenseful orchestral music) (rifle clicks) (metal clanks) (rope hisses) (rhythmic suspenseful music) (gun fires) (metal clanking) (Pecos grunting) (rocks rumbling) (metal clanking) (match hisses) (soft ominous music) (melted metal bubbling) (soft orchestral music) - Come up, Kid. - [Pecos] Yellow, you look so pretty. - Aren't they beautiful? They loved each other, Kid. My mother and father really loved each other. - They're somethin', all right. How do these Tulapans do that? - There's so much I could learn here. - [Pecos] What's gonna happen, Yellow? - I'm gonna stay. This is my home now, and these are my people. I'm gonna marry Shayowteewah and we're gonna serve them together. - I don't know, Yellow. Stayin' down here? You gonna be okay? - It feels right, Kid. Go on, take them. That's what you came for. There. You got what you always wanted, Kid. You got the gold and you got Rainbow. Now all we want is the horn and your word that you'll never come back here or tell anyone about this place. - If that's how you want it, Yellow. - That's how I want it. - Then that's the way it's gonna be. - Good. (men chattering) Then you're free to go. There's a pony out there waiting for you. - You sure this is what you want? I mean hell, they don't even speak English. (melted metal bubbling) - Goodbye, Kid. (somber orchestral music) - Bye, Yellow. (ominous orchestral music) (suspenseful orchestral music) - Ya. - In Tulapan, (speaking in foreign language). Yeah, (speaking in foreign language). (ominous tribal drum music) (chanting in foreign language) (speaking in foreign language) (chanting in foreign language) Yeah. (speaking in foreign language) Yeah. (Yellow Hair screams) Yeah. (speaking in foreign language) (Yellow Hair screaming) In Tulapan. (Yellow Hair sobbing) (speaking in foreign language) (Yellow Hair grunting) (chanting in foreign language) (ominous tribal music) (chanting in foreign language) (speaking in foreign language) (bright orchestral music) (gun fires) (rocks rumbling) (natives gasp) (rocks rumbling) (women screaming) (rocks rumbling) (natives screaming) (rocks booming) (natives crying out) (rocks rumbling) (melted metal zapping) (speaking in foreign language) (Shayowteewah cries out) (melted metal zapping) (boulder banging) - Hi, Kid. - Come on, Yellow, let's get outta here. (rocks rumbling) (Pecos and Yellow Hair coughing) (rocks rumbling) One thing's for sure, ain't nobody gonna get any gold out of that mountain for a long time. (Yellow Hair coughs) (rocks rumbling) Let's go. (ominous orchestral music) (boulder rumbles) (townspeople chattering in foreign language) (donkey braying) (townspeople chattering in foreign language) (soft orchestral music) - Ya had the gold, Kid. Why'd you come back? - They were gonna cut your heart out and find out you ain't got one. (Yellow Hair chuckles) - You didn't know I was in trouble. - One of us always is. - Come on, Kid. Why did you come back? - Gold don't mean much without you, Yellow. Is somethin' botherin' you? - [Yellow Hair] Uh-huh. - Me, too. - Buenos dias, senorita. You find the gold, Kid? - What makes you think I've been lookin', Colonel? - Don't waste my time, I know where you've been. - Think we can make a deal. - We ain't making no stinking deals! - Don't look like it. - Kid, my arm is gonna get tired and come down soon whether I want it to or not. Did you find the gold? - Yeah, I did. I've got a sample right here. And there's plenty more where that came from. I tell ya, it's layin' all over that mountain, shinin' and glitterin', just waitin' to be picked up. And you can see it from miles away. Yeah, I could grab hold of the colonel here and lead him right to it, 'cause you can pick up this stuff as easy as you can take a pistol out of a holster. (gold nuggets clicking) Solid. Almost religious, like you was in church. How 'bout it, huh? But you gotta move fast before somebody gets to that mountain first, ain't that right? - Oh, that's right. It's over there on that mountain. - Ya like that, boys? Don't be shy. Here. - Hello again. (Colonel Torres cries out) - Don't shoot! Don't shoot! Don't shoot! (door creaks) (Flores wheezing) (suspenseful music) - Kill them. (Colonel Torres cries out) (guns firing) - [Announcer] Will Yellow and Pecos escape this time? Here are some scenes from their next exciting episode. (soldiers shouting) - Stop. Stop! Come back, you traitor! Right now, that's an order! - No more orders, Colonel. We're riding to the mountain. We want the gold! (laughs) - Traitors! I'll see you hanged for this. (speaking in foreign language) (guns firing) - [Announcer] Does Pecos hit the dust for the last time? (guns firing) (dramatic orchestral music) Can Yellow finally get rid of her mortal enemy? (spurs jangling) (suspenseful music) (gun firing) Has Flores drawn his last breath? (bright orchestral music) Don't miss the next adventure of Yellow Hair and the Pecos Kid! - Go! And never come again! Dry-backs! We don't want you sneaking into our country. There's no room for your kind here. Stay on your side of the border with your own people. You gringos! (dramatic orchestral music)
