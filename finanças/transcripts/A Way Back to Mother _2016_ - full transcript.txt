Wow, Gimbap! Looks yummy! Mom, is today someday special? Today is my day off, so I decided to go an amusement park. Yay, awesome. You’re taking all day, newbie. Hurry up! My goodness! Why are you bare handed? Stupid Girl! You’ll ruin your hands. Caregiver Where the hell did she come from? My goodness! - Hello? - Hello? Is this Kim Seonnyeo’s guardian? Yes, it’s me. It’s been a while, so I wasn’t sure. I told you, it’s useless to call me. I’m her daughter but it has nothing to do with me. You just left her with me so it’s quite obvious. If this is about the bills, don’t call me. No, the patient... Doctor told us to get ready. She could die any day. Well, you’re not just going to pay and not take care of her funeral? You are her only family, so you should hold a funeral. I’ll call you. What are you doing? Shouldn’t you be working? Good, you should pay your debt every day. I’d like a day off tomorrow. What? What will you do with tomorrow’s payment? You’re not trying to screw me over again, are you? Just one day. I’ll work twice as much the day after that. Don’t kid with me. This restaurant is going to give you work tomorrow, so you’ll go work. I told you, I need a day off. I have to go someplace. See you the day after tomorrow. President Kim Yes, boss. I’m at Chunho-dong. When? Well, you need to drive tomorrow. - You know Yuna? - Yes. She’s going to somewhere tomorrow. I need you to track her. - You know where she is, right? - Do I have to do those things? Do you know how much she owes? So what? Look, you don’t know the business. - We can’t let her run away. - You want me to watch her? You remember how annoying it was when she went missing. Yeah, yeah. I’ll give you some reward. Errrrrr! Watch her carefully. Alright, I just need to drive, right? Fine, if that’s what you want take a day off. You’re not sick or anything, are you? I won’t be giving you extra like last year, so take care of yourself. Look at you, huh! You’re still young but you’re scrubbing dishes for a living. You should pay your debt and make a fresh start. Look, I can’t wait forever, so get a move on. Eldorado Studio So lucky, going on a vacation. Where are you going? Jeonju! Jeonju? Why? Just drive! - I’ll go to restroom. - Me too. Yes, we’re at the rest area. You are keeping an eye on her? You should be here if you’re that worried. - Come back by tomorrow night. - All right. Oh, shit! Damn it! Crap! Damn it! - I’m not going anywhere. - What? You’re spying on me. I won’t runaway, so don’t worry. Give me the address. There are too many. So, what the hell do you want? Give me the most expensive thing. How much will a cafe like this cost? If all the customers were like you, it would be great. What the heck are they doing here at this hour? I should have dated. I heard that you were divorced once. Yet you want to have a relationship? Aren’t you sick of men? I don’t get why this is so hard for me, others find it easy. What is that such a trifle? Are you sober now? - Let’s go! - What? I get sick when I drink coffee. Yuna! That’s fake name, isn’t it? Your name wasn’t that at first. Was it Suna? Or Sua? When I worked at a bar, my name was Hyorin. Then Jenny, Heryi and Sua. Now Yuna. What does it matter? You’re extremely deplorable. People pay the money for good naming. What’s your real name? Don’t ever tell anyone your name. Don’t ever tell anyone your name. Do you get it? Don’t ever tell anyone your name. Huh? You must have a name. I don’t have it. Everyone has a name. What the... Is your name like... Bongja or Deuknam by any chance? Deuknam? Yeah? Why are you going to Jeonju? Where the hell are you going? - Give me the address. - I’ll give you the direction. - Right turn here. - What? Here? Are you kidding me? Are we on a date? What are you up to? Why do you deliberately kill the clock? - Let’s just go. - Get off me. I just stopped by on my way. What’s wrong with it? Am I not allowed? Are you really going to Jeonju? Where are you going in Jeonju? - Hospital! - What, hospital? Just for the hospital? My mom’s there. What am I supposed to do? Why did you come? Either drive or just leave. Damn it, bitch! You’re crazy. You know that? What’s the matter now? I’m going to quit. I have no idea what she’s up to. You’re going to pay her debt if she runs? No... She’s just a girl. What’s so hard about that? And whatever happens, have her back here by tomorrow. Make sure she’s here. What are you doing here on your way to your mom? Do you have a gimbap this time? Did you come for a picnic? You create a picnic atmosphere alright. Gimbap always makes me sad. What? I always wanted gimbap when I was a kid. I envied kids who brought gimbaps made by their mom to the picnic. I can’t eat it anymore though. This reminds me of the old days. Don’t be so plaintive. I should have just gone to the theme park. What’s going on with the hospital and your mother? My mom... They say she’ll die soon. You don’t understand why I’m doing this, right? Ah man, I don’t like this. Aren’t vacations like this supposed to be fun? Well... Vacation’s not about where you go, it’s about who you go with. - Who am I supposed to go with? - Well... People you love or a family? Huh, not all families love each other. Your family is all that you have. When you get sick, who’s going to take care of you? So romantic! Families are like chains. You have to give them a funeral even if you hate their guts. Even you don’t see each other and don’t live together, sometimes... you still care and have this responsibility when it comes to your family. Do you know what I thought when I got that phone call? I realized that I’ve been waiting this phone call. And I thought, finally it’s over. Because I was sick of it. I didn’t get to live like others, I wanted to have good food, not just food to survive, and go to cafes for tea and go on trips... You got your wishes come true. And... And what, you have some other wishes? I want to sleep at a nice home. Today I want... to sleep at a good place. Just sleep well. Hello? Are you on your way? Yes, I am. - When do you arrive? - Tomorrow. It may happen anytime. Are you going to come or not? I don’t know. I’ll be there tomorrow. President Kim I don’t know. Special Crab stew Is it how you imagined? Yeah, this is the best. Is this your first trip? What’s the trip? We were so poor, mom had to throw me away to an orphanage. I got tired of it and ran away. I just... wanted to get away from mom. I didn’t call her for 7 years. Then suddenly someone calls me and tells me she collapsed. I was her only family, so that’s how it all began. Jeonju You’re quiet. I don’t want to see her. I think you don’t want her to see how you live. Both. I’m just afraid... to meet her. - No, it makes me mad. - Then, get angry. This is your last chance. Hansarang Hospital What’s her room number? Excuse me. I’m Kim Seonnyeo’s guardian. - Kim Seonnyeo? - Which room is it? - She’s in room 423! - 423? - Go up that way. - Thank you. She’s on the 4th floor. Why? Something wrong? Keep clean! Kim Seonnyeo And sure enough, you showed up. Patient have suffered from colorectal cancer. I think she won’t live through today. You need to get ready. I’ll be in the car. Hello. Hey, you guys must be having a great time, eh? Why aren’t you answering my calls? Where are you? We’re at a hospital. Is it true that her mother is sick? Yeah! No other families? Seems like it. Then, why didn’t you answer your phone? You... There’s nothing else, right? Nothing. You should come back today and keep an eye on her. Yes, I got it. Family Love! National health examination! Excuse me! Please tell the caregiver, I’ll come back in a bit Yes, I’ll. ‘In the cold, warm up your body.’ Uh, it’s a scarf. So warm! Mom, do I look pretty? Her skin is very delicate so wipe gently and rub this on her. What? Please empty this urine container. I really didn’t want to come. But to you... I have something to ask. I was afraid... what you might say, so I couldn’t ask you. That day... the day I came back... You said you were glad. Do you really mean it? Uh, it’s a chocolate! Never tell anyone your name. Do you understand me? Don’t ever tell anyone your name. If you do, a cop will come and take me away. So... don’t ever tell anyone your name. I’ll come back for you. Okay? When I earn money... If I earn a lot of money, we’ll live together then. Mom, mommy! Mommy, mom... Mom! Mommy! Mom! Mom! Mommy! Angel Orphanage I mean... by that age she should know her name and her address, but she’s not talking. Is she mute? Did her mother purposely abandon her? You know... if her mom lost her by accident, she should be weeping and wailing. Yeah... Well, if she’s really broke this could happen. We all know where kids with no homes end up at, but here, kids could at least have somewhere to sleep and eat. What kind of a person is it? How do you abandon your own child? Yeah... I can’t believe it, they’re really horrible. Faith, Hope, Charity Give hope to the children Hello, this is a home for missing children. Yes, chief. Yeah, we took care of it. Well, the kid who came in today wouldn’t talk at all. Yeah, I got it. Ah, the congregate dining, let’s not talk about that. That is... Yes, I’m a little embarrassed. Yes! Next time, I will definitely show the better me. Mom! Mom! Mom! Mom! Ouch! Mom, mom! Mom! Mom, mom! Mom, mommy! Mom! Mom! Mom! Diner Mommy! Oh dear, who is this? Mom? Mommy! Yuna! I’m so sorry. I’m so glad. Her kidney is useless, has a stroke and the complications due to a long illness. She won’t last long. So do you want to forgive her? There’s nothing to forgive or something. This is just frustrating. I won’t have any hope even when I turn 40 or 50. Because I will always live in her shadows. You should forgive her because she’s your family. Hello! Guardians, you should enter only one at a time, and we don’t know how long she can make it. Well, please empty her belongings from the room. Operating Room Staff Only I’ll deal with her belongings. So you should keep watch her condition. Hello? Dude, why haven’t you answered? Where the hell are you? Hospital, she just went in the intensive care unit. Why haven’t you left yet? She’s not working today? Her mom just went in the intensive care. She should be here, that’s why I send you there. ‘Please pick up the last gifts the deceased left’ If you see here, this Paulownia wood casket is made by glued laminated. And I think it’s suitable. And we have a shroud that is made by machine fabric and the price is very cheap. Have a look! There will be no funeral. Oh, I see. When we clean and dress the deceased we’ll see what the schedule is for cremation and get ready. It’s warm. As if she’s still warm. But, now it’s over. It’s over... Mom I’m so relieved. Mom... I dedicated this movie to my beloved mother. Directed by Lee Soosung Ko One Jeon Juwoo
