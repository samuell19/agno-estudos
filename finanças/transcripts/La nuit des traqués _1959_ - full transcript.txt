That life is beyond me That I feel lost In spite of you And that in my heart anxiety prevails Protect me Protect me When you see me Crying in silence Hold me tightly Very tightly against you Dry my tears And by your presence Protect me Protect me Soothe me By caressing my forehead Thrill me By repeating my name Talk to me And with these words of love Come my love To my rescue And give me The strength, if you love me, To overcome The fear that rises in me Against life, against people Against ourselves Protect me Protect me ANTWERP Stay qulet, Prince. Hide yourself. Can't you see It's freezing cold tonight? You'll get a cold and I'll have to heal you again. And Josette will scream at me if 1 look after you all night long. So, Vicky, found anything today? No. It's always the same. Every time 1 spot something some cop comes along. Try again, Vick. If you come empty-handed, they will call you chicken. Taretta will watch you with a bad air and the others will kick you out. What does Tarreta have against me? Why can't he let me alone? Club rules. You're the only one who didn't bring nothing. Well, I have to go now. Try to bring something. You still have time. Bye. See you later at the club. - Bye. Good evening. - As usual? - Yes. Vicky's not with you? He's sick? - No. He's not coming? - You know him, he found nothing today. He's afraid. One of these days Taretta will kick him out. - Yeah. It's Taretta that we should kick out. Don't you think? It was much better before him. We were stealing a little here and there. Nothing big. But since he has been here it only gets worse. Paul has stolen a necklace from a poor woman. Do you realize? Soon Taretta will force us to commit heists. It frightens me. Yes, me too. A glass of whisky? - You drink too much, Eventually, that'll get you. You don't drink enough, Jacques. That'll make you neurasthenic. He's right. You'll end up losing your touch. Let me see, Ren√©. - Hands offl That's what I've found today. Don't give it to Taretta. I've dreamed about something like this. You're crazy. I'm not getting in Tarreta's face. He'll never find out. Alright, you win. But hide it carefully. Behave yourself, "Legs-in-the-air". You act like you're still in love with him. So what? 1 think that Taretta won't like it if it shows too much. Come on, Rico. Play us something. - Okay. Wait. Listen to this. Listen to the story of Sammy who was born in California and liked to stay in bed with his honey doll. Sammy get up, the truck is ready to go! Sammy, believe me, there's work for you over there! Sammy, Sammy, your boss is yelling loud! He says he's going to throw you out! You take your time when one waits for you. It makes you laugh and you go back to bed! Sammy's story is going on since that beautiful night where he met the eyes of his sweet doll and was struck by love. Sammy, come on, the truck is about to leave! Sammy, tell your girl that you'll come back! Sammy, Sammy, she's pretty, 1 know that, Sammy, you can't spend your life lying in bed! You take your time when one waits for you. You take your time and you go back to bed! This was the story of Sammy, born in California, who wanted to stay in bed but lost his job. And his gal... " Hi. Okay. Let's start. Nice, huh? Not bad. Next time bring a crocodile one. Next. A silver necklace. Now you mistake silver for steel? - What, it ain't silver? 1 couldn't ask the broad, could 1? Eight cans of sardines. A pen... but broken! Two bottles of Beaujolais. So? - Nothing today. Not my lucky day. You're kidding me? What about that? Maybe your gal bought it with her savings? Give it to me. A wristband. In silver, this time. Books are worthless on the black market. - It's all I could find today. Better than nothing, right? That's it? Everyone's checked in? What about your friend Victor? He's not with you? - He went on the docks. He has spotted some good stuff there, - On the docks? Pissing in the harbour... That's all the brat can do! Be quiet, Prince. Be quiet. What can I get you? - Dubonnet, please. Sorry... it's yours? - You mustn't read that, kiddo. It's filth. Nothing else. Hey, you! This guy is completely nuts! This magazine belongs to me. That's the best yet! You're gonna pay me back back, old man. He completely ruined it. It's filth. Only filth. This stuff should be prohibited. - Good heavens! What did you get him? I'm old enough to read what I want. - Not him. - What? He's not old enough to read that kind of... junk. It's my problem. I'm free to read what I want. What you want... What you want... If I were your father... If you were his father, he'd rather be an orphan. Stop reading that rubbish, okay? - Leave me alonel Calm down. Don't look for trouble. This guy is a real heavyweight! Gosh, it's true that you really look like a kiddo... I'm sorry. Really. Here. Forgive me, boy. You don't look like a kid. You look like a real man. Take this and have a great on me. I didn't mean to hurt you. Really, I didn't mean to. Help! Help! It's a thlef. - You saw him? We're not waiting for your brother? - Not at this hour. I'm desperate, Michel. I don't know what to do. It gets worse every day. Now he hangs out with a gang of punks near the warehouse district. Well... Let's start without him anyway. I must be at the snack at nine. I have a headache. - I brought you a pineapple we received this morning. What's that? - A list of friends that we'll invite to our wedding. I've just added Willem. - We were not invited at his wedding. Come on, he's going to marry in the Ardennes! I'm going to his bachelor party tonight with Delvaux and the guys from Vermeulen. Don't drink too much. - Don't worry. You love me? A love big... like that! Don't worry about your brother. When we get married, I'll be his father, mother and great-mother! You'll see. I'll take him in hand. He's not a bad boy... - It becomes rather serious, Michel. They formed some kind of club. God knows what they're plotting. You see, I'm always afraid something bad is going to happen. Something like... I'd like you to talk to him tomorrow. - OK, I'll do that. Let's eat now. What the hell happened to you? - Nothing. You're wounded? - It's only Prince who bit me. 1 hope that you brought something at least! Don't worry. Look, little Victor is back! Hey, kid, we thought the wind had caught you! What kind of bounty are you hiding, Al Capone? An ashtray full of cigarette butts? Little Vick is sinking you all tonight! It was a blg and strong guy, 1 attacked him head-on! "Remember that God looks at you, remember that life is not eternal and that God is waiting for you. Go on and stop your sins. You who weep, come to me. God is Judging your actions and he's telling you: Here is the right path!" You're mocking at us? 1 didn't know! He gave me fifty bucks and I stole his wallet. - Why not his crucifix as well? So now you ransack the salvation army? Besides the sermon, what else did you find? Nothing. I didn't look inside. - Come on! - I swear, it's the truthl You can't say that! - What about 50 bucks? Here, take them. 1 give them back to you! - Taretta! - Shut up! Fifty bucks. Fifty bucks and a sermon. And a wallet that is not even in leather. That's your only bounty for 6 months. You're banned from the club. Get out of here. Get out! Just a second! - What? - Just a second, H. Bogart! He's a founding member of the club. No one has the right to expel him! Founding member of the club? I don't give a damn! A bunch of pussies! - You say that for me? - If it makes you feel better. Holy cow, sparks will fly! Joe's waking up! Listen, Luciano. Listen to me carefully, small-time Dillinger. You're pissing us off! All of us! No one dared telling you until now. But I will now! And not only because you took my place as boss and "Legs-in-the-air" from me. I'm telling you because everyone has had enough of you! What did you do for the club except making money off our back and sending kids on big scores that will send them in jail? So, listen up. If someone must leave the club, it's certainly not Victor. You understand, Al Capone? It's not Victor! You should drink black coffee. It makes soft guys excited. It makes nervous ones all quiet. And maybe it'd make you less stupid! That's enough! Please! Now we know who's the boss! - Really? Who's next now? Nobody to take care of this gentleman? Nobody? I'll give him a breath of fresh air myself. That's it! Come closer. I'm not going to eat you. Anyone can make a mistake. Maybe I reacted too strongly. True, you couldn't know what was inside the wallet. The guy opened it... - You call him Prince? - Yes. He's funny. - You see, the guy opened his wallet and I thought... Why are you keeping him for yourself? - Who? - Your monkey! Why are you keeping him for yourself? You should share him with us more often. Don't you agree with me, guys? Should he share him with us? You stole him? - Yes. - You must share everything you steal, pal. Of course, you guys can play with him. But someone must take care of him. Capuchin monkeys are very fragile creatures. If you like, 1 can bring him more often. He's funny! Sure but that's not what I call sharing. Sharing means giving his share to everybody. It's impossible! I can't leave him here all the time. He would die of cold. 1 tell you again, he's very, very fragile. And fearful, right? He bit mel I said we split, so we split him. Give him his monkey. - I must share him. It's the rule. You can't do that! I must carve him. First the head, then the legs. A small piece for everybody. If it's a joke, now is the time to end it. Throw him away. Throw him away. - Let Prince go. - Throw him away! You're gonna pay for thisl What's that mark on your cheek? You've been fighting again. When will you... - Please, no need to wake the neighbors. When Michel finds out... - You don't have to tell him. 1 didn't fight. I just fell. Please! Don't look at me like that! You don't work the night-shift this week? - No. It's bothering you? I had a headache. So I left. Well, go to sleep then. That's why you left, right? What are you waiting for? What's the matter with you? You never behaved like that. You know what you're becoming? 1 know. A perfect little punk according to your boyfriend. And I think the same! If you were not In agreement, there'd be no point in your wedding. What now? Why are you shaking? Vick... What's wrong? Go to bed. So you managed to come? - Yes, but it wasn't easy! I've been waiting in the cold. 1 thought my dad would never let me go. You have a map? - No. But I wrote down our route. You picked the farthest place from the warehouse district? - Of course. Will we make it? - I don't think or believe anymore. I don't wanna tempt fate. Listen! Don't be so edgy. I hope my dad won't wake up. His car Is still there. - It would have surprised me if Taretta took it off. You're sure there's nobody there? - How do you want me to be certain? You're okay? - I'm fine. We could have a glass of brandy in the bar. Taretta says... said that it takes 50% away from your reflexes. No more marks? - No, we cleaned everything. You're ready? Let's go. So you're driving? You drive and I'll guide you through the streets. No, you drive. I know where the one-way streets are. No, I'd rather let you drive. I'm better than you at spotting lights and cops at crossroads. My eyesight is as good as yours. - Don't make a fuss. Time flies. Come onl No, you drive. Listen, Vick... Don't be mad at me. I don't know how to drive. What?! What about those stories of you behind the wheel of your brother-in-law's 203? What about those stories about you taking a bend at 120 mph? You don't know how to drive? No, I don't know. I can't, Vick. - Me neither. Me neither... What are we going to do? Say, what are we going to do? 1 don't know, pal. 1 don't know anymore. We could try to bury him? In 2 hours it will be daylight! - How do you want to proceed? We've no tools. We've nothing. And then, with all the dogs roaming around here, they will find him sooner or later. It's not my fault, Josette. How did you come here? Prince woke me up. I realized that something was wrong. When I saw that you weren't there... He would have killed me. Ask Bernard. Tell her, Bernard. Yes, it's true. Who is it? Taretta, the guy who... Well, Taretta. It was an accident. I swear, Josette! We realized that there was nothing else to do. The harbour. But we don't know how to drive. Bernard said he knew but he lied. We absolutely have to get rid of him now. Police will catch you! You'll go to jail! - Only if they find him. Please, help me. I'll get Michel. Who is that? - Her fianc√©. Turn that off. She's gonna be a while. Michel? Michel? It's me. Say... It's almost 3. - Yeah. So? - Michel is not at home. Shit! What can we do? We're screwed. Michel showed me how to handle his van. I'll try to drive. Lefrain Street. Turn left. Turn left, left! Still far? - We must cross Brazil Avenue. After that, it'll be easier. What is it? The police? Brake! Drive on, quick! Someone's coming. You're not hurt? Nice brake, guys! It looked like you were aiming at those firemen! You weren't very far from your target! Stalling your motor now? You want me to give you a hand? - Thanks, I'll manage. - Sure. I bet you won't. - Come on, now! 1 bet you won't because you're pulling out the choke. The starter is here. Hey man, leave us alone. We'll manage. Josette, quick! After this light we're safe. You're wonderful. It's unbelievable how well you're handling this. Keep quiet. Do not distract me. Turn right. We're screwed. What's the idea of running a red light? Back from the ball? Papers. Officer, I had to go pick up my brothers and... Papers, Miss. I think I left them home. You think so? - Yes, I left them. Running red light, back from the ball and no papers? Follow me, please. 1 beg you, officer. My father will be mad at me. Because you "borrowed‚Ñ¢ daddy's car on top of it? Yes, sir. What's wrong with your brother? OK, go on. And be careful. Don't run a red light again. Wipe my face. I can't see well. You're crying? - No, I'm sweating. You see something? Let's hurry up. Open the door. Anyone? Come on, let's go. You want to stop for a second? - Yes, I'm exhausted. Come on. Quick! What's up with him? He should've given us the signal. It's the alarm that announces the 4 o'clock return to work to the S-E basin. Come on! - You're sure there's no one? - 1 am, come on! We could go take a look. - Yes but let's be careful. Go away! Go away! Don't wait for me. What was that? Customs officers? I have the feeling they caught Lino. We'd better stay hidden for a while before getting out of here. We'll try to find out what happened to him. So? It failed. - Failed? The Saturn didn't bring the goods? 1 couldn't stay. There was people hanging on the docks. What about Fred and Bolinsky? They were waiting for me in a hangar but I chose to hit the bricks. And missing 10.000 packs of cigarettes? Maybe Fred and Bolinsky waited until the guys from the boat arrived. Without you, they couldn't make the deal. The guy from The Saturn can't give goods to people he doesn't know. - Too bad. I'll try to contact him today. The Saturn leaves port today. You're getting soft? I put you on an easy deal and you run away. Afraid of your own shadow? - There was people! Look at that... Do you think I host you for 3 months now and will accept that kind of excuses? You don't say that in bed. I pay in trade, right? - So what? Don't you like it? It's a steep price. - It's cheap price in exchange of your freedom. Keep In mind that I know a lot of interesting things about you, darling. "I'm sorry, Inspector, but I host a guy without papers in my hotel. " - Maria! "I think he has secretly arrived from Cuba in a Panamanian cargo ship. " "I think he'd murdered someone in Cuba. " - It's not true! - You must be joking! I'm not a murderer! It was a loyal fight. So what? You think loyalty matters in the trial of a murderer? It was a political matter. - They're the most severely reprimanded nowadays. And now, you're going to shut up. Because you're not an angel either. By the way, how much do I owe you for all your good care? You owe me 100 bucks but that's not what interests me. Come on! - You'll leave me only when I tell you. Got it? Or else? - Or else... Don't get big Ideas. I'm Italian but I'm not at your beck and call. Who is it? - It's me, Michel. Open. What's wrong with you? - Oh, Michel, it's awful! If 1 only knew. Come on, talk! Victor... Something happened to him? It can't be... It can't be! What are you talking about? Tell me, where's Victor? - I don't know. How do you want me to understand? Explain yourself. Last night... 1 hope everything will be all right. What a nightmare! Come on, drink. You need it. I can't believe you drove that car. There was nothing else to do. - You could've gone to the policel It was an accident. But now it's too late. And Victor who isn't back yet. - Ah, that one! Please, calm down. I'm going to get the papers. La Gazette. Here, sir. At last. Don't bother! Josette told me everything. You come up with me? - No, I have to go. My old man will give me hell if he finds that I've had a sleepover! Vick! Without you, we were screwed. Oh, Vick... I know what you're going to say. I know the whole story. He wanted to butcher Prince, you understand? To butcher him alive! And he would've killed me too! Everyone will tell you the same. Sure, the witnesses of your great achievement. All your friends should become mute! No one will talk. I'm sure. Everyone hated Taretta. He was a scum. He was just a hoodlum. That's what you want to be, right? Not anymore. 1 swear, Josette. What happened to you last night? We thought you got scooped up by cops? Maria's furious! You couldn't recover the goods? - No, when we came out The Saturn was leaving. Why didn't we see you? Is It true that customs officers were patrolling? 1 think so. - And now The Saturn has left. Nothing too serious. Maria has another plan in the works. See you tonight? You'll see me. Well, see you later. - See you. Vick is In? - Yep, you read the papers? - Nothing yet. You feel better? - Yes. What are you reading? - Job advertisements. But I think there's a job for me at Michel's work. I'm going to look for a job too. My old man can't believe it! If he only knew... he would believe it even less. And the club? Don't worry. Try to forget. I've just seen "Legs-in-the-alr" and Ren√©. No one will return there. I can't help lit. 1 can't stop thinking about it. What can I get you?? - A beer. She seems pissed off. 1 think she had a fight with Lino. - Not a pretty sight... Lino comes with us tomorrow? - 1 hope so. Moving 200 bottles of whiskey is not really a cakewalk. Lino's coming with us tomorrow? Why he wouldn't come? - Maybe the plan had changed since your quarrel... Do I have to tell you my life? If he doesn't come, it's not a tragedy. You'll go and get the boxes with Bollnsky. - There are 200 bottles, Maria! We never gonna make it. - Don't talk so loud. Don't worry, he'll come. A banker like me is harder to find than a needle in a haystack. He doesn't know about tomorrow? - Not yet. We're going to tell him now. You're back at last! About time. - I'm not at your orders, am I? Hey, Maria. You told him about tomorrow's shipment? Don't tell me. I don't give a damn. I'm not in. So? - 1 don't know. He's not out yet. 1 hope It will work for him. - There he comes. How did it go? - It's okay. - You're hired? - I'm starting today. Bravol It's a good thing. I'm in a hurry. We'll talk at lunch. Tell Josette that I'll bring the bread. So you've made up your mind? You drop the ball? - I never go back on my word. Well, too bad. You'll regret it. Now I'm firing you. Get out of here. It makes you happy? The idea of not having to hold you in my arms anymore brings tears to my eyes. Bastard! Bastard! Of course, I'm happy to see you working. If only you had started earlier. Fear gives you courage then good advices. Please, let's change the subject. Forgive me, Josette. 1 can't tell you how much I regret. It's time for me to go. Don't forget to feed Prince. Can you tell me where Mr Gublit lives? Sorry, there's no Mr Gublit in this building. Yet, they told me... - Wait, I'll ask my sister. You don't know a certain...? - No! Get out of herel 1 bring you news of the friend of mine you have swung in the harbor. But I swear... I swear I don't know. - Come on! 1 saw everything. Is it you or your brother who killed him? But it's not a murder. He was just defending himself. We don't have any money! - No money? Perhaps we could come to another arrangement. You can't do that. - Actually, you have no choice. To hear you whistle one suspects that you have love in mind. - As you say. And her brother? - He's working now. - Good. You can't do that. I'll give you 1000 francs... tomorrow. 1000 francs? And only tomorrow! And then maybe 1000 the day after tomorrow. I'll ask my fianc√©. Credit isn't my strong suit. Here, I have 100 francs. Alright. Don't lose your time. You realize you're In trouble, together with your brother and your fianc√©? The police. The guys rocked in the water. They're always interested by that. So what? You know the deal. I'll scratch your back, you scratch mine. How can I be sure... that when "all this" is over... you won't give us to the police? You have my word. It must suffice you. Where the hell are you going? When he left me... he gave me a new appointment. Tomorrow. 10 pm. Same place. Come on, say something. - What should I say? - Please! My God! We must forget everything. To act like nothing ever happened! You said tomorrow? I'll go. - No, I don't want you to gol I'll beat him up! - And then he'll go to the police. You're right. It's not only about you, it's also about your sister and me. Damn it! I still cannot let him have sex with her 20 times more! What to do, my God? What to do? There's only one thing to do. Tomorrow at 10, same place... Good evening. It's nice of you to come back. It's also reasonable. - Listen, leave me alone! Behave like a nice guy. - Quite simply? I'm too old to be a nice guy. No, not in that hotel. - Why not? I'm afraid of being seen or being caught in a police raid. And the owner looked at me so strangely. 1 don't give a damn about that hotel either. You have something better? You know another place? Yes. Where? - On St Antoine Street. It's the flat of one of my colleagues. She's away and I have her key. Well, let's go. I'm suspicious of your tricks. 1 only have 30 francs. - What? Where's the room of your friend? Only 3 streets from here. On St Antoine Street. Okay, let's go. 1 don't see them. 10:20 pm. I have the feeling she couldn't persuade him. They're coming. He looks big and strong. - So what? The door slammed. They're in. What if he's armed? - I'll jump at him first. 1 want him to remember this beating. - Will it be over then? - I hope so. Tell him that if he goes to the police it will be his word... Put that cigarette out! I'm sorry, it's all my fault. - You can tell me your regrets later! That damn lock! - Wait. Quick, I don't want to be seen with you. Little bastards! Michel... Let me think! I'm going to do my last round at the factory. You can prepare my bed. Now we can go. At this hour everybody's sleeping. You don't have to come. - Ican't stay here all alone. Okay, come. Help me to put him on my back. Still drinking at this hour? - Go to bed and leave me alone! Spending the evening out Is not enough? - Will you shut up? - No, I won't! I'm going out now. - Henri! Good night. We have to, darling. There's no going back anyway. No... It's too horible. I'll never be able to do that.
