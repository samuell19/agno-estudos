When the People's Army captured Seoul and took over Hapdong News, I became a war correspondent for the North Korean Central News Agency Sept. 1950, Jeonju and was stationed in Jeonju. North Korean Central News Agency Jeonju Branch Protect Our People's Freedom! The line's down. What's going on? Maybe the Americans have landed? You worry too much. After spending all their energy on geishas in Okinawa, Kakinawa, wherever, the Yankees won't have the strength to do anything here. Isn't that so, comrade? Get your things together. The Americans have already landed at Osik-do. What? But that's only two hours from here. Right. They'll soon be here. We must hurry. Goodness, this isn't good. Everyone's heading North. Where are we going? We have orders from the Jeollabuk-do Regional Party. Excuse me? We're to join them at the Mt. Yeopwun Guerrilla Command. What? Cheer up, all of you. You must be the journalist comrades joining the Regional Party. Yes, and who are you, comrade? Pleasure to meet you all. I'm the famous Grey Heron of Mt. Yeopwun. Let's go! That was the first time I met a real partisan. Comrade Grey Heron led us to the Jeollabuk-do Partisan hideout in Mt. Yeopwun. It was an encounter with a new world It was an encounter with a new world The Guerrilla Command of the Workerf. s Party at the foot of Mt. Yeopwun. The Guerrilla Command of the Worker's Party at the foot of Mt. Yeopwun. That would fill me with both fear and curiosity. This way, comrade. Take care, comrade! - Take care. - Let's go, comrades. Right, follow me comrades. Being a journalist and not a communications technician, I was assigned to a combat unit- Look after yourself, comrade. From today you are assigned to the Fourth Company. We'll now divide into platoons. Comrade Seong, you have experience, so you'll be the patrol leader. Understood. A journalist? You took part in the student movement. What did you do? I protested against the US military government's setting up universities in Korea and Syngman Rhee's party's founding of a separate government in the South. Any military experience? I learned how to shoot a gun in the Japanese army... Drafted to fight against liberation then... Anyhow, we should make use of your military experience. I'll make you the 2nd Platoon Commander. As a petite intelligentsia, I hope fighting as a partisan will turn you into a true communist. Yes, sir. A Yeonhui College drop-out... Our company's going to be very intellectual. 2nd Platoon. Yes, sir. Comrade... Partisans have to be brave, right? Aren't you scared, though? Until our nation is liberated, the struggle must continue everywhere. Let's go to sleep. Everywhere? Who's there? I didn't say anything. Comrade, put on your shoes. Now! You better be careful from now on. You didn't pay attention during the training today. Wet or dry, a partisan must have their shoes on at all times, weren't you listening? Sleep okay? Yes. Comrade, what's wrong? My... spoon... - What? You lost your Party ID? - What did I do with it? Ah, here it is. Who's that lady? We came here together from my hometown. Still, you can't just give out your ID like that. Didn't you hear at the training, comrade? That spoon on a corpse tells us they were a comrade. Then we'll at least cover the body with leaves. Have some. Hey, you fell. You okay? After some basic training, we left for our first mission. Comrades! We haven't eaten a thing all day. We'd better have some breakfast in the village down there. As you know, that village isn't one of ours yet. The enemy might jump out anytime, anywhere. So you need to finish eating within five minutes of getting there. Our strategy is... - 1st Platoon! - Yes. Close off all the roads as soon as you reach the village. The rest just go into any house and grab and eat whatever you can find. Those who've eaten can make rice balls for the 1st Platoon comrades. I'm sorry, ma'am. Goodness! Thank you for the food, ma'am. Comrade Ma, this is for the 1st Platoon. It's a big operation this time, then? Winter is coming, so we'll gather supplies and launch an attack to show them our fire power. All the regional command troops will be deployed to attack at once to Mt. Hoemun. Godammit, he saw us. Comrades, that way! Women, take cover! Comrade Lee, we need to retreat! Damn it! Retreat! Retreat and cover fire! Comrade Jeon, run! Run or you'll die! Commander, I left my rifle. The rifle won't shoot! Commander, the rifle's broken! Everyone, over the hill to Sarak! Comrade Kim, look after Comrade Jeon! Do not retreat! They were following us. Good thing we came this way. - Down this way. - Yes, sir. Machine gun, over here. Are you hurt? Are you really okay? The Silence of Love Comrade Jeon, hand me that towel. What are you talking about? Comrade Jeon left his rifle and fled. We need to follow orders. But his situation was... Situation? There is never a good excuse for dumping a rifle. But isn't a man's life more valuable than a rifle? You're too soft and sentimental. Enough of that. We can't be victorious in our liberation with that kind of mentality. Well... We made good progress today. Let's not dwell on this. The commander has a good point. We've seized loads of weapons, but we need people to use them. But... the Company Commander is... After we buried Company Commander Choi in the mountains, we received an order for reassignment. The Command had already relocated to Mt. Hoemun. We, the 4th Company, were reassigned to the Eagle troops. Maengbong, who saved us that day, became the commander, and we set up base at the foot of Mt. Baekryeon. Together with the azaleas In the distant hot haze I see your face. Over the fields the shepherd's pipe lulls the baby to sleep- I see your face. Wait for me, my love, Until the fight is over. Jo Yeongja, Bae Bongsuk Lee Eunha, Jeong Eunok, and Kang Seonhui. Comrades, you've been transferred to the Command. Leave right away. But, Commander... What? Comrade Jo is... What about Comrade Jo? It's nothing. At your service! Ah! Comrade Park. Are you unwell? No, I'm fine. I look forward to working together. I've also been assigned here to the Eagle Regiment. Ah, that's good. Then you can use my personal washing station. Thank you. The bullet wound is infected. I can't believe he didn't tell anyone about it. It's really swollen. Hold it tightly. How does it feel? Doesn't it hurt? The damned night of Silla, do you hear the bell of Bulguksa... Comrade! Keep going. The pain is gone. Hear the bell of Bulguksa... Passing wanderer Comrade Park! - Rest your... - The small one. Weary legs The moonlight-.- Comrade, could you help? Comrade Park, take this. Nov. 1950 Wolchi village, Sunchang-gun Hurry up! I'm exhausted! The night of Silla... The bell of... Comrade Shin! They attacked us just as everyone left for Cheongwung. Fire! Fire! Run! To that stone wall down below! Second squad, to the well! Comrade Jeon! The smoke will cover you. Keep running to the foot of the hill. From there, throw a grenade. When it goes off, we'll make a run for it. Now run! - Commander... - Just go! So we burn the whole village down? Yes, our order is to burn down every village they get supplies from! But, Commander... Why doesn't it explode? Listen, Comrade Lee. We can't take you with us. Behind this wall, you're safe from the fire. When we're gone, do what you have to do. Comrade Minja! Follow me. Now! We're evacuating. So we don't have to burn this one down? Dunno. Maybe we'll as we leave. Wait, it's the next house. Is it? We're in enemy grounds. We have to get out of here! Private Kim! Come with me. Ma'am. Yes? Did you see two soldiers pass by here? Oh... They went that way. They're gone. You haven't eaten, have you? No. - Ma'am. - Yes? What's the matter? I found this over there. What is it? A spoon that belongs to communist guerillas. What? Communist guerillas? Who are you? Thank you so much, ma'am. When you report this later, tell them we ran off to Galjae. This way. You think this is a picnic? What if the enemy show up? I was hoping our people would hear it. That nap brought me back to life. What? After running for your life, you collapsed. You can hardly call it a nap. You passed out. Oh, did I? That's why you didn't scream when I was treating you. My hometown was In the mountains full of flowers..- Who taught you how to whistle with grass? My brother did. We lost our parents when we were young. After finishing school, I worked at the Daejeon Provincial Hospital, but I decided to go with my brother. Before the war, I worked at the medical clinic at the Wunam Dam construction site. But when the war broke out, my brother got drafted. A little later, I was told that he died in battle. When I returned to Daejeon, the hospital had changed to People's Field Hospital. So I became a medic. I was sent to the front. But during the Nakdong retreat, I fell behind and ended up joining this company. You ended up siding with those who killed your brother. It's hard for me to understand. I guess it must be. But I don't understand why there are two sides. And injured people need me, no matter what side they're on. It's getting colder. You must stay warm for your wound to heal. Hold me close. Get up! I'm a platoon commander of the Eagle Regiment. And she's a medic. Really? Yes. We belong to the Lightning Regiment. Let's go. Okay, got it. The Eagle Regiment is at Mulgu-ri defending Yakdam Peak. Also, the medic has been assigned to a hospital in Huiyeoteo. You should get going now. Injured soldiers are pouring in. They need all the hands they can get. Can you find your way to Huiyeoteo by yourself? Yes, sir. Good. Off you go then. Yes, sir. If it gets infected again, who will look after you? I'm sure Comrade Heo will. I hope you're not going to ask her for a hug to stay warm. Do you think she would give me one? I don't know. Who's there? Seyong! Commander... He's burning up. When the war is over, you'll be working as a journalist somewhere in Seoul, right? I wonder what I'll be doing. Maybe you'll... be waiting for me at the dinner table? Do you think we'll be able to meet again? As long as we stay alive... In case we don't... I hope you become a good journalist. I want to give you something, too. What can I give you? Use that to write something for me. Something I can carry with me. Though the fates us from each other sever, The flame that within my breast burns. I wish not your peace to disturb. On a snowy day by Seomjin River, To Minja, With love, Tae Though the fates us from each other sever... From each other sever... That line bothers me. It's from a Byron's poem. Be careful. Keep your guard up. Go now. Take care. I couldn't pull the grenade pin because I got scared. Thinking of my mom all by herself at home... I just couldn't... You said your father passed away last year? Yes. The police came to get him one day. They beat him all night. After he came home, he became bedridden. There was nothing we could do for him. - Commander. - Yes? If we keep fighting like this, good times will come one day, right? Of course. Good times will come. Commander. After the war, you'll take me to Seoul, right? Why Seoul? I want to go to an important school like you did. Sure, I'll take you there. Mortar, you are my comrade and buddy. Every time I see you, my heart fires up. Machine gun, you are my trouble-maker. Every time I see you, I get all infuriated. Comrade Ma, I bet nothing infuriates you. You always run away from battles. What? When did I ever... You should be ashamed. What's infuriating is that we have to waste soju on these guns because we don't have anti-freeze. That's more like it! Hey, do you want a sip? Which dumb-ass stuffed up my flask? As winter gets colder, we have to be more cautious. To a partisan, alcohol is like poison. It's cold and it kills me to pour it all into this piece of shit. Orders to mobilize! The enemy will show up at Galdam. The 2nd platoon should move to Sagusil. We, the 1st platoon, will move to Gagok. Hide! The yellow dogs are coming! Comrade Seong, run this way! We'll cover you! Makdung! Makdung! Cease fire! Makdung! Hey kid, come over here! It's dangerous! Come here, boy! Come to us! Listen to us. We're the soldiers! Come on, kid! Over here! Those are commies! Come this way. We'll give you crackers! Don't go to the yellow dogs! Come this way! Dol! What are you doing there? Come here right now! Mom! Hey, yellow dogs! Good to see that you're still human! You wild pigs! So you have a heart after all! Don't you want to go home? Go home and look after your family! We know the reason you stopped shooting wasn't the boy, but the dog! Isn't it one of yours? Wild pigs or yellow dogs, we all have the same forefather! Isn't that right, you pigs! So you bastards do know a thing or two! That's why we have to unite our nation and liberate the people, you ignorant fools! Come out with your hands up! That way, your lives will be spared! Stop talking shit and listen to this song! On the blue water of Duman River The oarsman set sail- Long ago... How many do you think? Not sure. Shall we join in? The boat has sailed off. Where has it gone? I miss my darling I miss my darling They seem to be twice our number. We're spread out, so it'll sound like there's more of us. You think? Hey, you yellow dogs! Think you can take our village with just 30 men? Think again, you bastards! You pigs! Stop fooling around! How many are you? Can't you hear? On the blue water of Duman River The oarsman set sail- Long ago, my darling boarded his boat. The boat has sailed off. Where has it gone? I can't see them. I miss my darling Comrade Kim! I miss my darling When will she come back? Hey, get up. Comrade Kim! Reading during a combat? Put that away. Who's there? Seomjin River. Baekdu Mountain. Things don't look good in Gagok. The 1st squad stays here. The 2nd squad and patrol, come with me. We're heading to Gagok. Yes, sir. - Patrol! - Second squad! Comrade Jeon! You stay here and if something happens, send word to Gagok. Yes, sir! It looks like the enemy has retreated. How about we go to the first squad now? Wait. This is just a calm before the storm. Yes, sir. Comrade Kim, are you writing poetry? No, sir. Is it a crime to fear death? I've always known you as a brave soldier. I scolded Comrade Ma in front of the others for being a coward. Then I thought it over. Isn't it human to fear one's death? That's very poetic of you. It feels wrong to fear death, which is so human, because we're in a war. Geez, it's freezing. I can't stand this cold anymore. I'm going inside. No, you can't. We must keep watch until the platoon commander returns. Black dogs or yellow dogs, they're too afraid of us to move at night. Do we really have to stay up all night in this cold? Let's drink just a little bit. What are you doing now? You know what I'm doing. I'm drinking. You'll get yourself in hot water. I don't care. This is warming me up. Comrade Kang! This way! Hurry! I joined the partisan guerillas because the times forced me to choose between the right or left. If this war can guarantee better lives for all of us, of course, I'll gladly give my life. But being forced to kill one another, not to mention kill our own countrymen for a better future... the irony of it all is... Such an emotional conflict will only make you lose your fighting spirit. You had enough. Stop being a wimp and take a sip. There you go! Damn it, we finished it off. Damn. We shoot just to survive. If we have to shoot only to survive... You probably can't stand your life coming to such a trivial end. But if we can make history with our guns, I think it's worth risking our lives. I don't know. This war is too complicated to be convinced of it. Comrade Kim! You've been acting strange since Comrade Jo left for the command center. Who said that, huh? Who said I scooped horseshit in the cavalry? Who the hell said it? Are you saying you really fought, riding on a horse? Who else would then? When I was a tailor in Seoul a long time ago, I rode all the seamstresses at the tailor shop. Who am I? I'm the great Ma Dalho! Ma Dalho, you know! You mean Comrade Jo Yeongja? She comes from a landlord family, and she loved books. One day she read my poem and fell for me. When I joined the partisans, she decided to come with me. She's too fragile and innocent to be indoctrinated. Then what cause is worth risking her life for? Those were the good times. Sure they were. So we're now fighting to get those good old days back. You're right. You're younger than me but you sure sound more grown-up than me. Who's there? What the heck! Seomjin River! Who the hell is Seomjin River? Huh? I'm going to... Isn't the sound from Sagusil? I think so. Comrade Jeon! Comrade Jeon... Hey! Commander Comrade... We got hit... It's all over now. Thank you for everything... Hey... Bastards! They've been boozing! Mom! Mom! So, a house full of reactionaries. Mom! Mom! This is a liberated area. After our forces made a partial retreat, you must have ratted on us to the yellow dogs. Tell the truth! You told them, didn't you? Mom! Mom! Platoon commander, take away the boy, and round up the village people in the lot. Yes, sir. Mom! Mom! Everybody, out! Your husband is a police officer, but you stayed behind in the liberated area to dig up information, didn't you? Your husband died recently? How did he drop dead? He was killed by you people. That's why you became their snitch! To avenge his death! Everyone, move away. The boy's mother bit her tongue and bled to death. Is there anything you want to say? Look up. Long live the People's Republic! Applaud! Welcome the death of Comrade Hwang who disgraced the national liberation war of the brave partisans. Applaud! Everyone is leaving. What's your relationship with Comrade Park Minja, the medic? She just treated me as her patient... You're all cowards, you know. Your fate and mine, what? What poem is that? It's a poem by Lord Byron. Who's Byron? Is he an anti-communist writer? Well, he wasn't a Bolshevik... Fine. You've been quite devoted to your tasks. But this could be considered as a serious problem. Indulging in romance, at a time like this, is to commit a grave mistake against our country and people. Anthing you want to say? No, sir. So you agree with me? Yes, sir. Pack your things. You're to report at the command center. Excuse me? Don't worry. It's not because of your note. The communications team requested your transfer. An agent has come from Mt. Hoemun. As the Comrade Hwang pointed out before he was executed, you're too soft and sentimental. Strip away that side of you. Then, you'll make a great warrior wherever you go. I understand, sir. Take care! Platoon commander! Please give this to comrade Jo Yeongja at the command center. I jotted down a few lines to her, thinking you'd understand. No matter where you hide in the winter, I can... Where are the women restationed, the ones from our company? Probably to the new company made up of women only. At the command center? They're a combat unit, so they can't be at the rear. If you have something, I can pass it on. As long as it's not a letter or something. Never mind then. What about the medic unit? Both of them take a full night to get there on foot. Well, I should have one more. Jeollabuk-do Regional Party Guerilla Command Center, Mr. Hoemun, Sunchang-gun Look, who's here? Oh, Comrade Lee! You've come all the way here! This is a newcomer, Comrade Min. Hello. Oh, finally! I meet a real partisan! What are you doing now? We actually called for you because of this. Peop arm chin arm pus to Jeche Peop arm chin arm pus to Jeche This must be a kind of encoding. This must be a kind of encoding. This much was possible because of me. Did you see the water-turbine-generator by the brook? That's my handiwork! Goodness, how did you figure it out so quickly? Well, I just hope it's right. People's army and Chinese army push to Jecheon? As the Chinese army's intervention turned the tide of the war, the days at the command center were relatively peaceful. I was even able to send out wartime newsletters. Those were the most carefree days since I joined the partisans. Still, I couldn't afford to visit Comrade Minja. I couldn't possibly look for the women company in order to pass on Comrade Kim Yeong's letter. I missed them- The 2nd platoon members including Comrade Kim Yeong. And Park Minja at the medic unit. However... March 1951 Comrades, hurry and retreat! - Where to? - Muster at the Daesumal grounds! All the troops from the province will retreat from Mt. Heomun tonight. We'll split into two groups. One group will go to Mt. Sobaek and the other to Byeonsanbando. - What about us? - To Mt.Sobaek. That's where the command center is headed. Comrade! Comrade! Do you know which way the medic unit is headed? The medic unit? I heard they'll be also split into two, because both will have casualities. All right, let's go. Is this... Is this the medic unit? Is this the medic unit? Do you know a medic named Park Minja? Ah, Comrade Park is going to Byeonsanbando. Where is she now? That way. They just left. Is this the medic unit? It's back there. Excuse me. Where is the medic unit? I don't know. Is this the medic unit? Medic unit? No. In the end, I couldn't find Park Minja and I had to move north along Mt. Sobaek with 400 or so men of Jeollabuk-do People's army- Meanwhile, the US-Korea combined forces were pushing north again toward the 38 parallel- May 1951 Mt. Baekwun, Ham yang-gun, Gyeongsangnam-do Another dark cloud loomed over us- A horrible endemic called "relapsing fever" that broke out in Jeollabuk-do company swept over our company as well. High fevers recurred along with severe pain and aftereffects- Since we had no medical treatment, we could do nothing against the disease that claimed many lives- Is this the tree that is supposed to be good for the fever? Yes. That's what I heard. Comrade Kim Yeong! Platoon Commander! About your letter... When I arrived at the command center, I became so busy handling the communication work that I couldn't look for her. And I lost your letter in all the commotion. I'm sorry. Did you hear anything about her? Nothing at all. There's rumor she died on the night we escaped Mt. Hoemun. Some said she went west. It's all my fault. Got a pencil? Sorry, I don't. What's with that fountain pen? This? I can't use it. There's no ink. Then, you'd better throw it away. Why bother to carry it around? There's no way I'd throw it away. Comrade Song, what brought you here? Oh, hello. You know Comrade Park Minja who went west, don't you? I just came back from there. When she heard I was a messenger agent from the command center, she came and asked me of your news. Really? So I told her you caught the fever. And then, she gave this to me. She asked me to give it to you. Isn't that aspirin? I envy you, comrade. Well, I've got to go now. Have anything to say to her? I can pass the word next time when I'm there. All right, then. - Wait, Comrade! - Yeah? In Byeonsan, did you meet a comrade called Jo Yeongja? She's petite and has a slender face. I don't think I know a Jo Yeongja. We used to call her White Lily. Next time you're in Byeonsan, please look for someone called White Lily... Hold on... Is that a letter? I can't take that. It's against the rules. I'll give her your regards if I see her. Well, take care of yourselves. Comrades! The Committee Leader is here! These men are here to pick out recruits on the orders of Comrade Lee Hyeonsang from the Southern Guerilla Command of the People's Army. Please follow their orders. If you're starting to feel better, please volunteer. If you transfer, you'll have more to eat. We weren't fully recovered yet. But the promise of a better food supply, was enough to convince Comrade Kim Yeong and me. The South of Mt. Deogyu June 1951 Thank you for making the long trip. I am Kim Heungbok, Commander of Victory Division. We have decided to reassign you disregarding your former rank and post. The goal of our struggle is not simply an expansion of the liberated territory. Our goal is to draw as many enemies as possible to our side and thereby set up a second front to create an advantage for the people's army. Accordingly, we'll be constantly on the move to disrupt the enemy. You will soon see why we are called Victory Division. Soldiers, show the new comrades to their troops! - First row, Daegu troop. - Daegu troop. - Second row, Seoul troop. - Seoul troop. - Third row, Jeonju troop. - Jeonju troop. - Fourth row, Yeosu troop. - Yeosu troop. Dismissed! Take your weapons and uniforms. Comrade Platoon Commander! These men look pitiful! In the old days, a real hero always had a bushy beard, isn't that right? These days the soldiers look like newlyweds. That fever must've been pretty tough, huh? But still, look at you! Why don't you get to it then! Excuse me... Are you from Cheongju? Ah! I remember you. You represented Cheongwon-gun at the speech contest. You remember! I'm so glad to see you. You're the first person I've seen from home since joining up. Fall in! Fall in! Accidental discharge! Which one of you dumb-ass men did it? For that one misfired bullet, you've got to steal 200. You sure you won't lose your balls next? If the enemy were nearby, it would've been your neck on the line. Okay! Move out! After leaving Mt. Deogyu, the Victory Division was always on the move, marching and fighting. We attacked police watchtowers in broad daylight. The partisans were as ferocious as we'd heard. And the soldiers' morale was high- Comrades! That's Dalddeugi up there! We'll be at Mt. Jiri soon. The mountain our teacher always talked about... The very place where we will stay to make our base for revolution in the south. If all the partisan forces gather, maybe we'll get to see our teacher, Lee Hyeonsang. Sounds like a dream. Let's roll! Comrade Lee, when was the last time you bathed? I don't remember my last time. Hey, what are you looking at? What a sight! Teacher! Teacher! I saw the legendary leader of the partisans for the first time. Lee Hyeonsang. He used his experience from the independence movement against the Japanese to lead the partisans when the Southern Worker's Party went underground. He was an ardent communist and nationalist- But he was a lonely fighter, politically rejecting North Korea and staying loyal to the Worker's Party with a dream of revolution in the South. After spending a night at Eungseok Peak, we planned a joint attack with Gyeongsangnamdo partisans on two police watchtowers that blocked Mt. Jiri's south entrance Let's carry out the attack tonight. Enemy attack! Enemy attack at the barbed wire! Shoot a flare bomb! It looks like we're outmatched. This isn't working. We should take out the watchtower with the 81 mm mortar. But there are civilian houses right next to it. We've only cut two holes in the wire after 5 hours of fighting. We've never done so badly in a battle before. It's going to bring down the troops' morale. How about forming a special squad to evacuate the residents near the watchtower, and then hitting it with mortars? They've quieted down now after a good shelling. They won't give up so easily. Isn't that right? Flare bomb! Flare bomb! I'll take care of the watchtower with Comrade Choi. You all go and carry out the operation. Be careful! Make sure not to kill the civilians while evacuating them. Comrade Choi, keep shooting. Don't be frightened! This area's gonna be mortared, so you'll have to leave. Sorry. I'll need these blankets too. Comrade Choi! Get over here! Hurry up and take these! Hurry and get out of here! Hurry! Hurry up! Run! Hurry up! - Prepare for launch! - Yes, sir. Fire! Charge! Comrade Kim Huisuk, Political Commissar Comrade Lee Bonggak, and some others who were injured in the battle headed for the disabled soldier's hideout in Georimgol. As my movement was impaired by a case of beriberi, I was sent along supposedly to take care of them. Wow! It's lucky you got hit in the thigh, Comrade Kim. A little further up this way, and nobody'd want to marry you. Listen to the bullshit this bastard is spewing. Face as pretty as a flower, but that mouth of yours! You do look a bit more womanly like this. You've got shit for ideology, comrade. Ideology! If it's revolutionary ideology you want, I'm from the damn best class. The labor class. I'm from the most foundational class! And yet all you talk about is women and booze. So what about that? You don't like women, Comrade Lee? No man dislikes booze and women! Try saying that when the Political Commissar is around. You think I can't say it in front of him? Say what, Comrade Ju? Oh, right... You haven't given me any orders today, so I was... Is that so? Comrade Park, you're healed up now, right? Yes, sir! Then return to your post tomorrow. Yes, sir! Whoa, that was close! It's a shame, Comrade Lee. What would your wife do if she saw you here cooking? No such worries. I'm not married. So I'm the only one worrying about you, then? That boy sings about cherry trees all day long. May well be his girl ran off to Seoul with another guy. What would a little boy with nothing but peach fuzz know about love? Do you know anything about love then? Where would I find time for love? My dad was beaten to death by the right-wing Youth League. Mom was lashed for having a communist daughter. While I was nursing her, I was so filled with rage that I joined the partisans for revenge, and left her behind. Maybe I should have thought it through a bit more. Is she alive... Is she dead... Yellow dogs, black dogs... They all look like the people who killed my parents. I want to get my hands on them and rip their guts out! After three weeks, we recovered and we left the hideout. A messenger came from the division to lead us back to our posts. They say when we return, you and I are going to get medals for fighting so well in the last battle. Stop talking nonsense. Really! It's true! The Political Commissar said so. Comrade Political Commissar, is it true? We're getting medals? Comrade Lee Tae, Come join the Political Affairs Team when you return. Me? How could I... No. It'd be our loss to leave you as a low-ranking soldier. In late September, all partisan troops assembled at Piagol. There, Chief Commander Lee Hyeonsang Piagol, Mt. Jiri presented the medals himself in a ceremony. The soldiers of the special squad during the last battle received medals for their service- Comrade Kim Huisuk was promoted to Battalion Commander. There was a huge celebration that night. Comrades! This is Comrade Lee Tae, who I mentioned previously. Meet your new comrades on the Political Affairs Team. Comrade Park Hyeonggyu, a general education officer. Welcome! Comrade Yang Jiha Glad to have you. - Comrade Lee Donggyu. - Looking forward to working with you! Comrade Choe Munhui a culture officer Nice to meet you. "Party Membership Name." Lee Tae Good. You are now a member of the great Worker's Party of Korea. You will work as the editor and wartime recordkeeper of the battlefront newspaper "Jirisan: Road to Victory." That fall, the partisan forces staged attacks at Gokseong and destroyed the Jeolla rail line. But counter forces began attacks, forcing us to roam between Gyeongsang and Jeolla Province on the northeast side of Mt. Jiri. With winter approaching, we camped at Hakdong-gol. At the battle front, armistice talks that had started in Gaeseong moved to Panmunjeom and on November 27, they almost agreed on a temporary ceasefire line. The ceasefire talks seem to be going well. Is it ceasefire talks or armistice talks? It's all the same, isn't it? The issue is what they will decide about us, the partisans. That's obvious. We are a legitimate troop belonging to one of the belligerents, the People's Army Command, are we not? When the war is over, we will be returned to North Korea... And we'll be welcomed as heroes of the People's Republic. Isn't that right? Sounds like a dream. What if our guerrilla forces are not recognized as a regular army, but as a criminal organization? What are you talking about, Comrade Lee? The People's Republic will surely request our safe return in the talks. No more of this. With things as they are, ceasefire is just a collusion. For national unification and the people's liberation, ceasefire or armistice must be out of the question. Comrade Lee, your turn to stand guard. It's freezing! I did one round and I'm frozen solid. There's lot's of talk about ceasefire and the South's winter offensive. As the ceasefire talks proceed, the fights at the front will continue as both sides attempt to secure an advantageous armistice line. It means we have to lure as many enemy forces as we can to these mountains, to help the People's Army at the front. If we draw off one division to fight us, we've done the work of a full division, and if one corps is dispatched to fight us, we're as good as a full corps. In order to strengthen the second line of battle and get winter supplies, we'll join the Geyeongnam 57th Division and attack a few strategic locations around. Please write a rousing speech for this occasion to read out to all the comrades. I will be waiting for your writing to get our blood boiling. Even if three hundred of us are annihilated, we'd have done more than an entire division, or even an entire corps. We win if we win, and we win even if we lose. Hagdong-gol, Mt. Jiri December 1951 We have the advantage in this fight. And finally it is time to sacrifice our blood for our nation and its people. Damn! The information must have leaked. Ready for combat. The bastards are pouring in. It's a blitz for sure! It looks like an entire division is attacking us. How about retreating for now? Contact the emergency line in each division. First retreat line, Chilseongol. Second retreat line, Georimgol. In order to weaken their attack, disperse our troops as we retreat. What the hell! Keep your ground, don't fall back! Comrade, there are orders to retreat to Chilson-gol. Damn... how are we supposed retreat? We don't have enough men or weapons to fight back. Come on. Hurry up! Fall back! Comrade Choi! Mom, mom... Mother... Yes... You've done enough, so go be with your mother. Light fires along the ridge and let 'em know that they're surrounded. Yes, sir. When the morning comes, block all roads to Chilseon and Georim, and close in on them. We're surrounded on all sides. If we can't make out of here by morning, we're all dead meat. How bad is the damage? Divisions got mixed up in the retreat so I'm not sure, but it seems more than half are either dead or missing. The fire has died out on the cliff over there. No other way but to go down the cliff. Let's go. 40.000 soldiers were sent to Mt. Jiri to drive us out, a joint attack by the Field Corps under the command of Baek Seonyeop, and the Capital Infantry Division of the Southwest Combat Command. We retreated in our platoons- We trudged through snow-covered mountains to reassemble at the first retreat line, Georim-gol. To the valley! Come on! Comrade Huisuk! Keep moving! Here! Comrade Huisuk, you can make it! I can't... Oh no, you're bleeding... I'm fine... Comrade Huisuk, get up! Stay with us. You have to go see your mother. Mother... Huisuk... Pass. Pass. Turn around. Pass. Turn around. Pass. Turn around. Pass. Turn around. Pass. Turn around. Pass. Turn around. Pass. Turn around. Pass. Turn around. Get up! The dogs have pulled out! Get up now! Wake up! Fast! Comrade Kim Yeong! You are alive! Is this the Yeosu troop? No, it isn't. While retreating, I got mixed up with your troop. I see. You can light fires. Warm up for a bit and head to Georim-gol over Samsin Peak. We have rice stored there. You can eat steaming rice! We have been on the run for a week without food. Moreover, most men have frostbitten legs and cannot even walk properly. If we get no support from the North, we won't... Look here! You're so-called a general education officer! How can you be mouthing off such a defeatist speech? All I'm saying is that we need to face the truth. We've fought in the direst of conditions. We are worn down with cold and hunger. At the time of the Bolshevik revolution, Siberian partisans got supplies delivered to them by trucks. The partisans in Manchuria during the Japanese colonial times farmed fields to get food during their struggle... But what about us? Mt. Jiri is the best place for a base in the South for partisans... but we are stuck here within 15km in radius. We cannot even send a signal to the North much less have communication. Comrade. Instead of such a defeatist attitude, you need a strong historical conciousness! No matter what difficulties we're faced with, history is always on our side! - We will be victorious! - Yes, of course! There is no victory on either side. Our tragedy began when we could not liberate ourselves from Japanese imperialists with our own strength. Instead, we gained our liberation by the hands of other nations. These are the embers from where the never-ending struggle of the people in the South and the tragedy of this so-called civil war emerged. Whether it's the South or the North that wins, it won't be the victory of our Korean people but the victory of Soviet Union or America. Comrade. Say that again! Let's calm down. Leaders such as you should not waste time on inappropriate discussions. Why don't we come up with some constructive plans to boost our tired comrades' morales? Take some rest. I was listening to the debate amongst the leaders. When I was in Hakdong-gol, I met Comrade Lee Bonggak of the Political Committee. I heard you recommended me to the Political division. I heard you rejected. To fight as an ordinary soldier. By fighting the enemy head on I wanted to know why White Lily joined the partisans and the reason we have to be apart. I felt that only then I could find the real meaning of this war and the true identity of the enemy at my gunpoint. Look at our comrades. At this moment, aren't our enemies hunger and cold? And the lack of sleep? Right. The most unbearable thing is that faced with pain, hunger, and cold, I'm left with nothing but the instinct to survive. White Lily and the meaning of this war... I've forgetten all that. All I want is to survive. Comrade Park! Look up! Up! Air Strike! With bombers supporting them, the South Korean army closed in on us. We were becoming more and more exhausted. Comrade, look at the state you are in! You have to take care of your feet! These are the feet of the republic! The feet of the people! The line got cut off. Some idiot must've dozed off and strayed off. Comrade, you must bring them back and join us. We will slow down for you. Alright. We will mark our way with broken branches. I will go with him. Daeseon-gol in Mt. Jiri Comrade! Comrade! A medic fainted from exhaustion, so I stopped to take care of her... And the others? Others? There are more who got lost. We are here to bring them back. Comrade! Comrade! It's Georim-gol if we cross this mountain! We can join our comrades there. Stay strong. I can see them. They're eating! Comrades, am I really alive? Where are the others? Where is the emergency meeting point? Where the hidden weapons... The arms depot? It's in Banyabong It takes a day to get there. We have to walk over another ridge? My feet are rotting away from frostbite. It'll be two days, not one. Let's go. We have been starving for over ten days. We haven't slept either. So? We still have to go back to our line. If not, we'll either freeze to death or become feed for those dogs. How about we go around Yongsu Rock and Imgeol-ryeong? Right. It would be easier. There is a farmer's mud hut before crossing Imgeol-ryeong. We'll be able to get food. We can reach there before evening today. Come on. Defection card- Look at your former comrades- They have found happy new lives! They say if you surrender with this, they'd let you live. They won't kill you at least. This place is the same. There isn't a even a rotten potato to eat. The yellow dogs must've moved the farmers away and ordered them not to leave a single bag of rice. Let's go. Comrade Ha can't go any further. His legs have rotted up to the knee. When I rolled his pants up, He fainted at seeing the state of his legs. He didn't know it was that bad. It's a miracle he walked all this way. He'll die if we leave him. No! My leg! My leg! Where is my leg? My leg! My leg! My leg... Comrade Kim, look after Comrade Ha. I'm going to have a look outside. Comrade Kim, my leg! Comrade Ha... In your state, it will be hard to reach Ban ya-bong. It's a downward slope from here to the village. You'll be able to go down even if you have to roll down. Show this to the enemy. They won't kill you then. No, I don't want to! I am scared to go alone. I want to go with you. Comrade Ha, this is the way for all of us to stay alive. No! The platoon commander and medic went down last night. What? They ran away. Damned cowards! I will never do that! You are different from them. You're surrendering because you have no choice. Comrade Kim! Comrade! Comrade Kim, take me with you! Comrade Kim, please! Comrade Kim! Comrade Kim! Please! Please! If we take you, all of us will freeze to death. Here. Surrender... Or... Comrade Kim! Comrade Kim! Comrades! Comrades! Comrades! Comrade Kim! He won't commit suicide, will he? Let's go. Comrade! Don't move. The platoon commander must've ratted on us. It's good in a way. They will find Comrade Ha. Come on. Let's run. Stay back! Don't come any closer. It's dangerous! Stay back, I said! Put the safety pin back in. You must've seen the card. We'll let you go if you surrender. Now! Comrade Ha! He died because of me! Search the house. Let's go. The hut is empty. Sir! Comrade! I cannot go any further Com... Comrade! Cease fire! The footprints end here. He couldn't have gone far. Search the area thoroughly! We will mark our tracks with broken tree branches. March 9, 1952 I was captured in Ouigongli village, Sicheonmyeon. 16 months later, the armistice agreement was signed. In the agreement, there were clauses about demolition of armory and, the retrieval and transfer of casualties of the war. But there was no mention of those who were alive and left behind to wander the southern mountains. Between 1949 and 1954, 20,000 people from both the South Korean Army and the partisans were killed in the Sobaek and Jiri Mountains. In the three years of the Korean War, 1-3 million people died and 1-1 million went missing from both sides. This film is dedicated to those who lost their lives in the war.
