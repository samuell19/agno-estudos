- I think in December 2006, we were losing the war and there's no great need to paper over that assessment and people knew we were losing and the question, really, was whether it was salvageable. Not whether it was headed in the right direction, everyone knew it was not. - The strategy was really simply to hang on, hold on, it wasn't really to win, it wasn't to protect the people it was just to kind of keep a lid on the situation. And gradually improve the quality of the Iraqi's. The way this got expressed in Washington by the president and the White House is as they build up, we build down. - The strategy we were operating under of transitioning security responsibilities to Iraqi forces was a path to failure. - Maliki as a mid-2006 prime minster so you're foming a government, you're learning how to bring a government together, you're fighting a very tough conservancy that is well organized, well financed, very complex, from internal generated, some external generated. The neighbors are not helping. You're trying to do that at the same time raise an army and train an army. This is not an easy thing to do. - The troops were pretty much positioned on large bases on the periphery of Iraqi cities. They would conduct patrols into the areas to try to secure them, but they bedded down at night back at those big bases and I don't think they understood the kind of sectarian violence and sectarian cleansing that was going on once they left the neighborhoods. - The level of violence went up to a degree that we were unable to cope with. - There was an ethno-sectarian nature to the violence, I was unsure what would happen if we continued to reduce our presence like the current plan was. So I was trying to think through ways of what can we do to affect this? What are the things we need to do in order to make this successful? - General Odierno was in a difficult position. What he wanted to do was do a significant surge, a substantial surge and really get into doing counter insurgency in a significant way. The problem is, he was a subordinate of another general, General Casey, who didn't favor this approach. - We started, then, working options with the potential of using additional forces. I then contacted the Army, had my staff contact the Army and ask, what would be the max amount of forces that would be available? And they came up with five brigades over extended period of time. - General Odierno was stuck with this and operating within this. He had no direct communication with the White House. He had no way to, you know, tell the president or his national security adviser, "Hey, I've got a different "approach, I think we need to go to more of a counter "insurgency approach where we protect the population. "A more offensive approach where we go after Al Qaeda "and the Baghdad Belts and approach that and more "American assets." There was no way for him directly to communicate that. However, he was in regular touch with General (mumbles) retired Army advise chief of staff and Keen got that message across to the White House. - Staying the course was gone so you could either try to do proper counter insurgency, which we now call the surge for shorthand, or you could try to do a plan B like sort partition. But that would've been hard 'cause Iraqi's couldn't agree on what plan B should be and it would've had it's own implementation issues. Or you could accept defeat and leave. - In the early part of December, the president has made the decision and principle that there should be a surge. And to try to rectify the situation in Baghdad. But just what the surge was wasn't clear. And there were different, kind of, perspectives as to what it might be. - When you talk about a counter insurgency you add a whole 'nother layer of functions that military officers aren't used to dealing with. Governance, economics, politics, diplomacy, culture. And all these kind of things go in to making a counter insurgency campaign really really complex. - It was a change of the paradigm is what it was. Wasn't simply the matter of same number of forces. If we had sent additional brigades to carry out the old strategy of transitioning, it would've have worked so well. - Patraeus was the one who was best positioned by his experience and by his expertise in this area and it was somewhat encouraging so it made me think that we had the full 25% probability of possible partial success, which was about I would've ascribed to the surge under any command. - I think anybody who's honest with them self and with others will clearly acknowledge that folks who had the responsibilities that we had would have plenty of worries. There has to be a greater emphasis on the task of security, in particular security into the population. You have to keep in mind, again, that when the level of violence is as high as it was, there's just no way that anyone is doing anything other than surviving. - The situation was actually much worse than anyone had let on. I don't think we were purposely given misleading data, I just think we didn't know. - I actually put my head down on the desk for a second and wondered why in the world I had agreed to do this. - I took command in June of 2006 and the brigade at the time was told that it would be on a "prepare to deploy" status, in other words it was kind of a strategic reserve force with the focus, obviously, being on Iraq, but not a definite deployment order or date. That changed very quickly. Around the September time frame we found out that we were going to Al Anbar, to Ramadi. - The Dagger Brigade combat team suspect that we were going to Iraq as early as June of 2005, when I took command of the brigade. We were ultimately notified that we would take over responsibility for northwest Baghdad. - I received my mission to take responsibility of the Rasheed security district, the east and the west side. It's the southern half of Baghdad and it stretches from, my portion stretched from the Baghdad airport over to the Tigris River. - My mission was to enable the government of Diyala to provide services and security to it's people. - We deployed in June of 2006, arrived in Iraq in July of 2006. The bulk of the brigade, our mission was to conduct counter insurgency operations in Mosul and Nineweh province. Later, we moved to Baghdad we became the multi national division Baghdad strike force, a very mobile mission. And we also, also the core commander, General Odierno's operational reserve. So he would call on us when there were problems in some far flung corner of Iraq. - Ramadi was essentially destroyed. I don't think you could find a single building in that city that had not suffered some sort of damage, and some of them were completely destroyed. The center part of the city near the government center was essentially a large pile of rubble. It reminded me of pictures I'd seen from World War II and places like Stalingrad or Berlin or, you know, that level of destruction. - Let's talk about fresh water, let's talk about sewage, banking, food, food distribution points, schools, hospitals, medical clinics, what we found when you looked at just those simple templates in the Shia areas those systems, those services were either fully functioning or moderately functioning. In Sunni areas they were primarily failing or were no longer in effect. - It was literally a gray dark scary neighborhood. And that was what you were walking. You know, I'd put a gun truck in front, a gun truck in back, and you'd walk an entire street. - The level of violence in Ramadi was higher than just about any other place in Iraq, so it was one of the most, if not the most violent place in Iraq, and thus, in the world. I don't think you could go more than 25 meters without finding a hole in the street from where an IED had gone off. - The enemies principle weapon was the improvised explosive device, or the IED. That particular weapon and the enemy's use of it accounted for the vast majority of US casualties. - We saw significant murders, kidnappings, IEDs, and vehicle born IEDs focused against the local nations first, the Iraqi security forces second, and coalition forces third. - 90% of the time in the first four or five months there you'd get ambushed from the left or right by somebody. Either they're shooting at you or they're shooting at each other and you just happened to get caught in the middle. - Sectarian violence was starting to spike, specifically in Baghdad. Sunni and Shia, it was spiraling out of control. AQI conducted an attack on a Shia neighborhood using car bombs or just plain complex attacks. And then there'd be Shia death squads that would respond back in Sunni neighborhood, then Sunni's would respond back and the escalation kept going. - There were certain combat zones between Shia and Sunni sects where we would find upwards of 275 bodies a week and sometimes more piled up in spots as a message to members of other sects that this is your fate. - We were tracking numbers as high as 500 and 50- something deaths in the first month we were there. 500, I mean, that's an Iraqi citizen in my neighborhood that was executed with his hands tied, him or her or kid, hands tied behind their back, blind folded, either beheaded or shot in the back of the head. - Al Qaeda was enemy number one. So my main effort was Dora. - What you had was Al Qaeda in very large numbers and very determined to hold Ramadi. - Al Qaeda in Iraq is an organization that is predominantly Iraqi, but has traditionally been lead by foreign extremists who have very clear links to Al Qaeda senior leadership in the federally administered tribal areas, or perhaps the lower northwest frontier province of Pakistan. And who do get direction, some resources, reinforcements in the form of foreign fighters, especially suicide bombers, from outside. - They didn't care who they killed, they don't care who they kill. To say they're merciless indicates that at some point they had mercy. The Al Qaeda members that we fought against had no mercy, they never had. - Al Qaeda was made up of a handful of hardcore extremists. I mean, these were the people that you had to kill or capture, there was no way around it. You were not gonna convert these people. The vast majority of what I found were people who were disenfranchised with the government, they didn't' have any money, they didn't have a job, and they had large families to take care of. - High level Al Qaeda leaders had to be taken out, but you have to understand that many of the lower level guys who actually conducted the direct action, these are people who were coerced into attacking us. It wasn't uncommon at all to find out that a man that attacked us did so because one of the Al Qaeda leaders would go into their house and hold their wife and kids at gunpoint and say, "I have a friend who's watching the "intersection, if you don't do it, they're dead." - The car bomb, or vehicle born IED, was the enemy's most important weapon. It was the one weapon that could be used with great precision. It's very very difficult to protect yourself against that type of a weapon. The enemy like to attack heavily populated markets, schools, gas stations where people may be queuing up for fuel. - Al Qaeda is primarily a psychological operations machine. Their purpose is to conduct attacks that are visible. - They would hope to communicate to the world at large, to the region, and to the people or Iraq that they had the capacity to kill at will. And gain dominance over the population, thereby, and to show these same people that their government in Baghdad was not capable of protecting them, nor was the American military. - Rasheed was a microcosm of all of Iraq. I had on the east side in east Rasheed the predominant threat I had was Al Qaeda, Al Qaeda in Iraq. On the west side I had predominantly Jaish al Mahdi, Jaish al Mahdi specil groups. - There were special groups fighting for the Jaish al Mahdi, or army of the Mahdi that Muqtada al-Sadr claimed leadership over. Many of whom were supported by nefarious elements from Iran. - John had an idea of, like, Al Qaeda wanted to take Iraq, (mumbles) wanted to take back and take over. - Most of the east side was Shia and then on the west side you had Koda Mela, which was mostly Shia and they were driving the Sunni's out toward the south down into Dora and Rasheed. You could definitely see that there was a plan to drive the Sunni population out of Baghdad. - What had happened, of course, in the wake of the Samarra Mosque bombing in February 2006, was that the Jaisha al Mahdi was unleashed, the Shia militias started rampaging through Sunni neighborhood killing the young men, for the most part, and forcing families to evict and they were well on their way to cleansing Baghdad of Sunni residents. It was, I think, a very organized campaign. I'm not unconvinced that some political figures were involved. - You had a Jaish al Mahdi organization who really stood in for the government. Which is what gave them power, I mean, they understood that they needed to please the people to some degree in order to remain anonymous and to remain safe and their tentacles ran pretty deep. - They had transitioned form this militia aspect to organized crime because they saw the benefits of crime and crime based enterprise in an area that was relatively lawless, or really lawless. - They might go up and down to businesses and say, "Hey," just like the mob in this country in the 20s or 30s and they would say, "Hey, if you want to keep "your store open, I need a little money every month." - The Shia did use IEDs of various types. Not always clear if they were involved in the use of car bombs. Their signature weapon was the explosively formed projectile, or EFP. Controlled items, the components of which would come from Iran. Most of these weapons were attributed to special groups of the Jaish al Mahdi. It was out opinion many of these groups had received training in Iran. - At the time I don't think we realized how much Iran had in fact begun to influence the Shia militias. And we started, as we continued to conduct operations and learn more and more about those individuals we picked up, we really started to learn about how much Iranian influence was in there. Originally we thought it was weapons only then we realized they were conducting training, they were providing money, they were providing support and so we knew now we had another problem we had to deal with and that was countering Iranian influence. Which we knew it, we just didn't know the scope of the problem. - We new Al Qaeda's aim was to win in and around Baghdad. That is, reduce the legitimacy of the Iraqi government in the eyes of the Iraqi people, show the people of Baghdad and Iraq and around the region that the Iraqi military and other security forces and the American military could not secure the population of Baghdad. We knew that's where they wanted to win. - A raid was done by first brigade, first cav up in Taj and they uncovered an Al Qaeda command control center which had their plans, which basically was control the belts and then create sectarian violence inside of Baghdad. - There were a lot of ungoverned spaces in Iraq and Al Qaeda Iraq, you know, embedded themselves in these sanctuaries close to the capital. They created their car bomb factories and their torture mills. - We also had a very clear understanding of how they divided up the battle field. Between the areas that they wanted to attack in Baghdad and the areas where they sought sanctuary outside of Baghdad. So, in essence, we saw and understood where the enemy aimed on achieving tactical effect within certain neighborhoods and where he supported his operations from outside of the city. - You have easy access of whatever you needed from the outside, don't have to keep it in Baghdad, keep it outside and whenever you need it bring it in and take it out. - Ground matters to Al Qaeda. They're not some amorphous force that lives in the cyber space and flits from here to there and, you know, shadowy figures. They're human beings that need what every human being needs. Shelter, food, sustenance, they need access to communications, road network and whatnot, and they found these areas around Baghdad in the so-called Baghdad belts that they used as sanctuary and then they would inject violence into Baghdad and then retreat again to their safe havens. - When you go after it's about going after a whole network and you gotta go after it in a variety of ways. And so you have to go after their ability so they can't have support zones and safe havens where they can do whatever they need to do in order to feed the insurgency. So we had to cut out, we had to cut the feeding tube to the insurgency. - You have to take these away. This is not just about decapitating an organization that's as large as that, we killed Zarqawi, who was a charismatic, very operationally savvy leader and yet the level of violence when up, not down. And the reason was because someone else stepped into his shoes, there were lots of other candidates for these positions. - General Odierno made the decision that we were gonna win in and around Baghdad. In effect, we were going to mass all of our capabilities, both our physical forces, the attention of our commanders, the positioning of our command posts, the focus of our intelligence, and our focus on Al Qaeda was gonna be in and around Baghdad because we had to win there. We had to secure the population there. Now, to do that, to mass those capabilities, you have to accept risk in other areas. - Risk is a hugely important concept and it's obviously how much you are jeopardizing, if you will, to what degree are you placing in jeopardy some particularly important task or mission. And all of this is about risk. You never have all the resources you would like. - A lot of the brigades went into the areas around Baghdad, which made a lot of commentators and politicians puzzle and shake their head going, "I thought we were gonna secure Baghdad, "why are you going into Arab Jibor?" Or, "Why are you going into Kallis, why are you going "into Taji, why are you going into Abu Ghraib?" Well, that's what you needed to do to secure Baghdad and that piece of the strategy wasn't well understood outside of those within multi-national force Iraq and multi-national core Iraq. - One of the things that's a bit ironic about the surge is it was really a misnomer. Because it was really more like a trickle. And even though there were to be five Army combat brigades and a couple battalions for Arm Bar, the process was such that you had a brigade arriving really once a month. So it wasn't this dramatic kind of coup de main that overnight changed the situation. - So as the first troop brigades came in I allocated them directly to Baghdad. When the third one came in, I allocated it partially to Baghdad, the other part around the belt, and then when the fourth and fifth I did the same thing, partially to Baghdad and around into the belt. - General Odierno, I think in his mind, had a very clear idea how this would eventually evolve. And we had to start with Baghdad, secure the belts, and then pursue the enemy. I think he and I, actually in February in one of our last meetings I laid out for him in a map where I thought this thing might play out, if we could win the fight in Baghdad it would shift to Diyala and eventually up to Mosul. - The absolute fundamental prerequisite of countering an insurgency is to either control the population or to earn their support. - You've gotta deny the fundamentalist, the extremist, on both sides access to that moderate population. You have to demonstrate to the moderate population that there is an opportunity to influence their own futures. - We knew we would need more US forces in Baghdad, but it wasn't just about forces, it was about our procedures. And it was really focused on protecting the population. - In order to protect the population you have to form a relationship with the population. That's the real key fundamental, I think, difference in the way we approach counter insurgency in 2007 was we acknowledged the fact that we had to develop a very close relationship with the Iraqi people. - Somehow we had to stop this cycle of violence and the only way we were gonna do it was to get off the FOB, live out there amongst the Iraqi people, partner up with the Iraqi security forces and fight these guys and demonstrate to the Iraqi people we were on their side. - As part of the transition plan we had moved back into the bases, we had to push our forces back out into the communities so we were there 24 hours, seven days a week. - The idea is to get every capable American soldier off his base and out with the population where he can do good. - I think that's about the time we started putting out these COPs, the combat outposts so that joint security stations all throughout Baghdad. - Which, essentially, is a company of about 100 to 150 soldiers living in the neighborhoods throughout the district. You put the COP up in 24 hours. It was fully functioning in about 30 days. First step was find the fault line, where is the most violence occurring? And then you go into the neighborhood, fight your way into the neighborhood, and based on terrain analysis, fight yourself, your unit to a particular piece of terrain and you'd take that building. You'd drive right into it, guns blazing, take the building, you own it, and then you would build it out. That gave you height to look down into your neighborhood and fields of fire to shoot. Every neighborhood was different. One that we occupied was an old gymnasium, it was ideal. - When the sun comes up in the morning, the enemy is confronted with a small outpost of ours controlled by our forces with good force protection from which we would then conduct subsequent operations. - And this became a bit of a template for us that we'd clear an area to assist arriving surge unit to get into their battle space unimpeded. To ease their transition into the fight and allow them to establish their joint security stations, their combat outpost like that. - Over time, as you held this thing and hardened it, then you gave a 24 hour constant presence out here chasing bad guys where you knew they were shooting at you from. So you'd raid that site, kill or capture or chase them off, and eventually it got smart. They wouldn't come in close 'cause we'd put snipers up around the building that could shoot you a mile away. The first 30 days was contentious because the bad guys, the Al Qaeda or the Jaish al Mahdi tried to overrun the COPs. Each and every one of them would get a barrage of mortars, RPGs and machine guns and a wave of attack of, you know, 10 or 15 guys to try to overrun it. And that went on for the first 30 days. After that, we'd get an occasional sniper shot, an occasional RPG, an occasional mortar, but they couldn't risk attacking. - The division commander, with his planners and his operations officer and his intelligence officer decided where the operations would go in succession. Normally we knew for sure what we were gonna do next and maybe the thing after next, the operation after next. And they would have a running list of bad places that they wanted us to work in. And, essentially, where ever there was a bad place in Baghdad, they drew a circle around it and eventually it was on our list of things to do. - When they saw our forces come in and go in the neighborhood, when they saw the striker vehicles one day, the next day the striker's there again, the next day the strikers were there again. They found out that we were sticking around. - Generally what we did in Baghdad day to day was kind of grinding hard physical labor. Soldiers wearing 50 to 60 pounds of body armor, water ammunition, weapons, moving through houses, multiple floors, clearing sky scrapers for eight or 10 hours a day. We did this, really, for two reasons. One, to disrupt enemy activity and the other one was to clear the enemy. - In March of 2007 we had a great opportunity to partner up with the airhead brigade combat team and Steve Townson and his great striker troopers. - Colonel Burton's brigade laid about five or six hundred meters of concrete barriers every night. This notion of safe neighborhoods had arisen in multi-national division Baghdad and it was a way to keep out the car bombs. And also to keep out the insurgents, to keep them from moving about freely we would barrier in with concrete a neighborhood that we wantd to be a safe neighborhood and we'd establish entry control points. So if you lived or worked in that neighborhood, you could come in and out freely, but if you didn't live or work in that neighborhood, you had to pass through an Iraqi security checkpoint just to get in. - When we went out and one weekend put in a series of barriers, regular Jersey barriers three foot high, between north and south Ghazaliya dividing where the sects were, we saw the murders in Ghazaliya drop by 50% because the death squads couldn't come in. - What's so interesting about this Iraq war is it's high tech. There's, you know, precision weapons and satellite guided munitions and (mumbling) communications intercepts and all sorts of mechanisms, and then it's also as simple as building a concrete wall. It's like the most primitive thing you could possibly imagine. Sometimes it comes down to that. - You can only look down range, if you will, so many months. You can have a broad concept in mind that you're gonna focus in Baghdad then you're gonna have to do some, pay attention to the belts, northern and southern, and certainly the effort in the dagger that's pointed at the heart of Baghdad, which is the Euphrates River Valley. But you recognize that the enemy gets a vote and the enemy will react to what we're doing and we have to have the flexibility to react, as well. - As we went through November to March, I believe that the enemy was in a reconnaissance effort. They were kind of side stepping. I mean, you got 2.1 million people, it's pretty easy to hide amongst a population that wants to hide you. So you can just kind of step out, and it's the old they're not wearing uniforms, they don't have a big bright neon sign to say, "Hey, I'm a bad guy, "come kill me." They fade into the crowds. So they watched us. They watched us put in our barriers, they watched us put in the checkpoints, they watched us put in our combat outposts and our joint security stations, they watched our patrols, they watched our patrol routes, they watched our routine, they watched our rhythm. They watched where we watched and they watched where we didn't' watch and they came up with a plan to kill us. - In January, February, March, the car bombs were just terrible, the suicide VBIEDs, the vehicle born IEDs were just awful in Baghdad. Tremendous casualties causing every day and also this atmosphere of instability and chaos because of the car bombs that, seemingly, could not be stopped. - We went through that March, April, May time period, you remember what it was like here in April. You know, the Shorja Market bombing, the Sarafiya Bridge bombing in Baghdad. I mean, it was about a major car bomb every other day. - They came at us hard and they came at us in Shula and Kadimiya, and Hurriya with explosive form penetraters from Iran and they killed a lot of our soldiers. And they hurt a lot of our soldiers. And they came at us in the Sunni areas with home made explosives in very large quantities and extremely large buried IEDs. And they came at us on known patrol routes, and they came at us with a vengeance. - Of course, the enemy's gonna fight to get back into it. He's gonna fight to reestablish himself. So this takes active work to keep the enemy out. - About the May time frame is when we peaked, I think the number was 550, or 980 something lethal attacks, whether it be mortars, IEDs, small arms fire, rockets, in that month of May there were 900 lethal attacks in my area of operations. - You could, as an outsider, point to that and go, "See, the strategy's failing." But in fact, that was a sign that the strategy was succeeding because we had begun the operation needed to gain control of the battle space and eventually secure the Iraqi people. - By the time the last surge brigade combat team arrived in June, we had as many troops as we were gonna have. Whether we thought they were enough or not, we knew there were no more in store for us. The strategic well was emptied and so it was then a matter of doing what we could with what we had at our disposal. - The theory was by simultaneously taking action in a variety of areas, they would make it more difficult for this Al Qaeda of Iraq elements to move from, you know, simply to move from one area to another and avoid the sort of whack-a-mole phenomenon where all you did was chase the enemy from one neighborhood to another neighborhood, but never decisively engage them. - This was really General Odierno and multi-national core Iraq's doing. They created an operational concept beginning with Operation Phantom Thunder that really knocked the enemy back on his heels, ejected him from his sanctuaries and put him on the run. And once he was on the run, they kept him on the run until they were cornered in their last piece of Iraq up in Mosul. - Around June and July we were starting to see success in the belts. The violence was starting to go down in Baghdad, except we continued to have one significant problem, and that was Baquba. - My sergeant major and I traveled up to Baquba, started frequently, after the first week we were travelling up there weekly to attend memorial services for our fallen soldiers from 520. And so I would see Dave at these memorial services, or the hero flights, the flights where the fallen warrior was flown out of Baquba and off to the United States. And as this advances along through March, hero flights, memorial services, April hero flights, memorial services, some time in April we're standing next to the helicopter where the helicopter had just left from and it's dark and we look at each other and I can't remember who said it first, but I said, "You need some help, I think you need help Dave," or Dave said, "I think I could use some help." - I looked at Steve and said, "I'll work for you if you "will come up here, if we could get you up here to help "seize control of Baquba." - General Odierno comes to my headquarters, he said, "What would you do if you were me?" Well, my executive officer, Joe Davidson, and my S3, Adam Rock, S2 John Clawson, we're all standing there debriefing him and they were a little hesitant to brief him because in Baghdad we'd agreed the day before we were gonna table discussions about going to Baquba, about those ideas. And General Odierno looks at him and says, "Hey, we're in a war, I want to win, you want to win, "tell me what's on your mind." They said, "Okay, sir, here's what we do about Baquba." They presented the briefing to him. "We propose that as soon as we get done clearing in "Rasheed you send us to Baquba, we go join the regulars "up there and we help the Gray Wolf brigade sort that out." Within 24 hours we had a warning order to go to Baquba. - I decided to allocate a striker brigade to Baquba to first eliminate the safe haven and sanctuary which had been created in Baquba. - General Odierno decided to conduct an operation called Phantom Thunder, of which head ripper was a part of that. That was our operations in Baquba. - He was able to bring his entire brigade plus part of my brigade working for him into the city, dominating the terrain of Baquba overwhelming any Al Qaeda elements that may have been in there. - Operation Phantom Thunder succeeded fabulously and I don't know if it was beyond anyone's expectations, but it was certainly at the high end of the range. From the time it began in June until the next really critical event, which was of course the testimony to Congress in September, you could see the enemy was taking a severe hit and violence was dropping. Especially among the key indicators of violence, which was ethno-sectarian violence and civilian deaths. - Once we were finished in Baquba I knew I had to go out further into Diyala. And then as we had success in MNF west I knew we had to go further out into the desert, out in MNF west. I knew we had to go further to Lake Tharthar. And then as we had success, I knew we had to go to Tarmiyah and Taji to the north. Then as we had success we kept pushing them away from us further north and then I knew we'd have to finally go north, which is where we're at today. - I'll be honest with you, those first eight weeks, I wasn't sure that this was gonna happen. I mean, I didn't see, every time we talked to someone, or interacted with someone, "I don't know anything, "don't talk to me, those were people from outside." And we must've heard that answer a thousand times and what I didn't know exactly how to do was how do we make that connection? I mean, how do we do this? - They hadn't seen American forces there in quite a long time. Not in significant number. So they were afraid. They were afraid, "Well the Americans will come, "we'll align ourselves with them, the Americans will "leave and we'll be wiped out." And it took a while for these Iraqi's (mumbles) to say, "Wait the American's have come, this time they're not "leaving right away. "They're at least gonna be here for some sustained "period of time and we can gain control over our own "area by aligning ourselves with them." - We had to have a place for the Iraqi citizens to gain a 24 hour touch point with somebody they could trust. Because they didn't trust us. Remember, we were leaving. They didn't trust the Iraqi security forces because they were all Shia. So what are you gonna do? Well you're gonna go out there and show them that you're gonna be part of the solution. - We made two decisions, I believe, that really started to turn the corner for us. The first one was that we decided to remain in the neighborhoods 24 hours a day seven days a week. And I don't mean, this is in addition to a combat outpost and a joint security station. We had a platoon at each one of those in Dora and we maintained two additional platoons on the ground. Three o'clock in the morning, three in the afternoon, there were our Hum V's and soldiers out there and we never leave. The second thing that we did was an operation called Close Encounters. - And that was an attempt to find out all of the information about every single person in the entire area that we were responsible for. - We would literally, when it was really violent, block off a street, put security up on the roofs of the houses so we were safe, knock on the gate, as to come in and say, "What's your name?" And, "How long have you lived here?" And, "By the way, do you know your neighbor?" And, "How long has he lived here?" And, "What do you do for a living?" Or, "What did you used to do? "What are you biggest concerns?" When you sit in their house and you not only visit that person on a personal level, but you go to every house on the street, then if you're an insurgent you don't know who's talking because these Americans are going into everybody's house. They can't target anybody. - When they show that we were serious about what we were doing and we were mixing with the people and so they're coming to use with more information and more information meant more targets. More targets meant more information, more targets. So, I think the interaction between the people and the our forces and the coalition forces was key to get the ball rolling and continue this process. - It was important we detain the right people, you have to attain actual bad guys. 'Cause if you detain somebody who's a local son, if you will, and he is not bad then you set yourself back, your credibility drops, just like it would with the police force here if they detained somebody who we know is innocent then our credibility's gonna go down. - We managed to knockout every single one of the five major stones that we're operating in our Mahala in the course of about 72 hours. On the 20th of June 2007 one of the most effective and best planned complex attacks I've ever seen or heard of was conducted by Al Qaeda against our third platoon. Within that first hour after the bomb detonated, I was back on the FOB doing intel work and our phone was ringing off the hook. Not with people telling us who did it or even, which had happened very early in the deployment, laughing at us because we had successfully been hit, but by people calling and saying, "We are so sorry "and we are ashamed of this and we want to ashore our "sympathy to the men who died." And it was, that wasn't the turning point, the turning point had obviously happened earlier, but that was the first indication that I had, unequivocally that we had changed the perception of the coalition forces and correlated to that is the perception of Al Qaeda. - The Iraqi vision of American forces morphed from liberator to occupier to despised occupier to some sort of impartial benign tribe that could hold things together because the Iraqi's were fighting amongst themselves. - What kind of began our successful engagement with the Sheikhs was this police recruiting requirement. Over the years, a number of people had been trained to be Iraqi police, recruited and trained, but then when they got back from training they just went home, they never reported for duty. These were guys we didn't have to go out and recruit, they were already recruited and trained they just started showing up to work every day. As soon as every Sheikh saw what was going on, they all wanted a police station in their neighborhood, preferably across the street form their own house. - The Sheikhs of Anbar will tell you this started in different and that one group was fighting long before the other group, but what we experienced in Ramadi and central Anbar was that it kind of started in the western tribes and the emerging leader was Sheikh Sattar Abu Risha. - This guy was right out of central casting. He was flamboyant, he was courageous, he was good looking, he spoke well, he was very pro-American 'cause he realized that we were absolutely necessary to the tribe's ability to eject Al Qaeda from Al Anbar. - He talked to one of my battalion commanders who he knew from various small level engagements and said, "We want to meet with your brigade commander, "we want to get something going here with the coalition." - He wasn't really seen initially as being anybody of any significance 'cause he wasn't part of the big tribes and he wasn't part of the old tribal hierarchy that a lot of the analysts had been studying. He was kind of the new breed coming in. - I went up and sat down with Sheikh Sattar and, uh, they said, "We have an 11 point declaration that we "want to read to you." These people had pledged their lives and their fortunes, you know, to stand up against the tyranny of Al Qaeda and say, "No more and we're not gonna hide "and we're not gonna be afraid, we're going to fight "for our own liberty." - General Petraeus met him, evaluated what was going on in Al Anbar and how it came about and realized that this was something that could be expanded. (indistinct talking) - I think it was something that he probably had in his mind all along, part of the counter insurgency doctrine is you don't want to fight every insurgent in existence, you want to bring as many of them into the political process as possible. You want to provide amnesty to a large number. - When I was in Hurrijab talking to Sheikh, it was pretty interesting. He told me, he said, "You know, when I was talking to "Sheikh Sattar," I said, "What do you mean talking "to Sheikh Sattar?" These people were all talking to each other and they were all sharing their kind of lessons learned about how you can work with the Americans, how you can benefit from this relationship. - The tribal leaders saw that as things were getting better, if they didn't participate they'd be left behind. And so they became very aggressive at working reconciliation and getting their young men to participate with the security forces and process as either sons of Iraq or CLCs. - Once the tribes were able to defend themselves, then it became the AQ and the JTJ people's turn to be afraid of the tribes. And tribal justice, make no mistake, is pretty rough and ready. - So this whole thing was just an absolute complete failure for Al Qaeda. They went back to the very specific targeted operations to take out key personalities, which was, you know, what they did regarding Sheikh Sattar when they killed him in September of '07. - I remember I could see the smoke plume from the IED from my trailer on Camp Ramadi and I couldn't immediately tell that it was on Sheikh Sattar's compound, but then I quickly got a phone call and it was just kind of a, you know, you get this sinking feeling and you think, "Oh my goodness, what's happened?" And I went over there immediately and it was amazing. He had hit an IED probably 100 feet behind his own house. - We were brothers, you know? And I'll tell you, when he was killed, it was as though I'd lost one of my own and it was incredible to me. And my wife and my kids got upset about it, too, even, you know? 'Cause they knew how close we were, even though they'd never met him. - While it certainly is the case that the tribal awakening in Anbar predated by some months the announcement of the surge, the infusion of additional forces and the new tactics and strategy reinforced this tribal awakening and encouraged it to spread. And it encouraged it to spread in Diyala and when Steve Townson's brigade arrived and cleared out Baquba, this further reinforced the effort and this tribal awakening thin really began to grow significantly in the Diyala province. So, that was an off shoot of the clearing of Baquba. Might not have been fully anticipated by anyone, but it was a change in the situation that the military took advantage of. - The system that we call the Sons of Iraq, that program grew out of what we were doing in Anbar in Ramadi the situation I faced was I needed to grow a police force really really fast to hold these areas that we had worked so hard to clear with the Iraqi army. And it's not easy to do that in Iraq. - It is certainly the case that a high quality policeman takes three years to build. You hire a person, you send them to an academy for eight, nine, 10, 12 months, you put them in a probation period with a partner for a year or two, and then you have a real good policeman. It is also the case that if we did that in Iraq we'd have lost the war. - We started out with what we call police auxiliary forces concern local citizens. In some cases these were guys that volunteers to stand on a street corner and make sure that nobody entered that neighborhood that didn't belong there. - We called it the neighborhood watch program. By allowing them to guard their neighborhoods and protect their families and stand against Al Qaeda, then that's what they did, they protected their neighborhood. They would not conduct offensive operations, they were protecting their families and their neighborhoods. - These were people, sometimes former insurgents, sometimes not. But these were people from the local area who were able to say, "Enough. "I live in this town, I live in this district and I've had "enough of this." - These guys were already created, they were already armed, they were already fighting. It's just better to have them fight someone else rather than us. - I watched this process where these guys came in, they administered kind of bi-metric IDs, they took their retina scans, they gave them kind of traffic guard vests, these kind of orange fluorescent vests, which was the primitive kind of friend or foe kind of thing so you at least could know who was on our side. - They came forward, they would protect the local areas 'cause there was no police or Iraqi army there and then we'd be able to continue our operation. - We ended up being able to transition several thousand of these neighborhood watch guys into real, no kidding, Iraqi police. Drawing a paycheck from the Ministry of Interiors. So that was a huge success story for us. - For me to think when we first got there they would actually have Iraqi's in uniform standing up in their neighborhoods was a fantasy. There was no way that ever entered my mind as any time of realistic part of the fight. - 103,000 Sons of Iraq later, here we are. - This is a big turning point in the counter insurgency because now you have the population turning against the insurgents. - The question was always, really, when will it turn, if you will? When will we see a down turn in violence that is sustained? And, of course, the answer was about a month or so after the launching of the surge of offensives. And thankfully, again, it came before the September testimony. - I knew in late September it was really turning and in October I was very hopeful and about December I thought, "This place is safer than the green zone "right now." The first time I went up to the international zone to pick up an Iraqi reporter, we were supposed to pick two and one of them was a cameraman and the other guy was gonna do interviews and it was gonna be on one of the Iraqi networks for their evening news. We went up there to get them and there was only one guy there, he was the camera guy, the mic, I said, "Where's the other guy?" And he said, "He didn't show up." Said, "I'll bet he was scared." This reporter began to talk to my interpreter, you know, in Arabic and I could see my interpreter who was a good friend of mine, after all that time, say, "Hey, this guy's terrified." And we would go into Dora and he'd say, "Dora's safer than you are right now, "there's no rockets coming into Dora." And the guys just couldn't believe it and so he is visibly fumbling with his chin strap on his helmet and he's in my Hum V and I'm trying to explain to him what's going on and we get there and he's holding the camera and he's doing the interview and he's talking to people and after 10 minutes we couldn't keep up with him. We were walking down, he'd say, "I want to go in this "school," and he'd go in the school and talk to kids and teachers and he'd say, "Let's go down here." And he was so excited from what he was seeing, it was nothing like what he thought and he was a reporter. - The progress just became absolutely undeniable when you reduce the number of attacks by 80% or whatever it is when deaths from violence are reduced by 80%, when our casualties began to go down and so forth, again, those are facts. - The surge was always predicated on the assumption that if we improved security that political progress would follow. - Toward the end of 2007 there started to be some agreement on some pretty important pieces of legislation. And eventually, by early 2008, in February you have the three major laws all passed in one legislative session, one day. The budget for 2008, which distributed the oil income equitably, provincial powers law and the amnesty law. It was the so-called hat trick day, or trifecta. And it was a very important day for Iraq. - Politics in Iraq, for whatever you can say, they're not at a stand-still. There's a lot of politics going on. They're not frozen. They're highly dynamic. But what we wanted to do was keep them talking rather than fighting. - Lots of contention, lots of noise, lots of dissonance, in the legislative system, but you know, that's what democracy is all about. It isn't about consensus and everybody agreed on everything, it's about fighting it out. And yet they've shown an ability to do that in a sense of compromise. - That was always against a backdrop of friction, substantial emotions, discord, drama, and always, always 11th hour and beyond deals. But, to some degree, that is democracy, or at least it's Iraq-racy, and it has representative features to it that are, again, encouraging. - In our last few days I went around and talked to a lot of the friends that I had in the area. We all did that. I went out with third platoon Lieutenant Gross and we saw some of the people that had helped us early on when nobody else would talk to us and we said goodbye to them. There was one particular family that had this girl who was, I don't know, six or seven or something and she really liked Lieutenant Gross a lot and she was crying and crying and crying and when he left and it was very touching how many people were sorry to go. We had men in their 50s who would, you know, give us these hugs that would last uncomfortably long periods of time saying, "You've changed everything "here, thank you." - I still stay in touch with the governor. I still stay in touch with member of the provincial counsel, I still get emails from tribal leaders inside the province and security force leaders. You can't go through a 15 month experience like that and not with shared experiences with these individuals and just walk away. We will forever be connected. And my goal is some day that I go there back to Diyala with my sons and they're able to play soccer with the governors son. - I went back in October when I was on the join staff. I was chief of the Iraq division there so I had an excuse. And I got to see a lot of my old friends that are Arab and even some of the military forces, the US forces that were there had fought under my command, as well. And walk around Ramadi without any body armor on and see how the seeds of reconstruction that we had planted had blossomed over the intervening months under the very able leadership of John Charlton and his brigade. And I felt like a World War II vet going back to liberated France after the war. I was mobbed by little kids and the streets were thronged with taxi cabs and commerce of all sorts. I had very little protective security around me. Most of the security was provided by Iraqi police, who were mostly concerned with keeping the traffic flowing on these very busy vibrant streets. Most of the scars of war had been removed, the remaining concrete barriers had been painted over with floral murals. And I wish that I'd had a video camera with me to video tape and send it to all the families of all the soldiers who had been killed or seriously wounded to show them what it is that their sacrifice had achieved. It was probably the highest moment of my life. - There are a lot of enduring qualities about war. You know, we had a number of savants in uniform and out who said, "Well, there was this military revolution "going on in the 1990s and in the future with our high tech "sensors and weapons we'll be able to see everything, "know everything, kill everything and therefore wars "will be short, sharp, fought at extended distances, "and will be relatively bloodless on our part." And I think Iraq has showed us that that's wrong, that was is a very human endeavor. That fog and friction will always exist in war and that whatever military revolution the invention of the computer, micro-processor, and precision weaponry brought to use was probably consummated in the Gulf War and that the question now is what's next? - We have many dialogues about the loss of savvy in our military and about our ability to fight a conventional war. We had a lot of discussions about our unpreparedness for this type of war. I think if anything this war has proven is the resilience of the American service member, his and her tremendous ability to adapt to the conditions that they're confronted with, and if empowered, if empowered to make decisions appropriate to the situation, that they can deliver this thing consistent with our national objectives. But when we constrain them through misunderstandings of the tactical operation strategic environment on the part of decision makers, then we run at great risk to accomplishing what we set out to do. - What lessons have the Iraqi officials drawn from this operation? And have they drawn the correct lessons as they negotiate this sofa? Have the political leaders drawn the lesson that they could do this on their own? If they have, they've drawn the wrong lesson. I think the Iraqi military knows better. They're increasingly taking on more responsibility, and that's all to the good, but they're not at the point where they can do operations like that against entrenched resistance without some significant American support. - What you re-learn, really, because it's something that we should know from our study of counter insurgency in the past is that every situation is unique, that what's required of the counter insurgent isn't a very nuanced understanding of each specific situation. - Sometimes you can have a political solution that solve your problem, sometimes you don't. You have factions that require military solutions or a combination of military solutions, political solutions. And who you deal with and how you deal with a problem is very different. So, there is not one solution. There is a basic concept that you can use. But how you use that concept had to be adapted to the environment that you're operating in and that's really the key. - Now we see the potential here in Iraq for a fundamentally different relationship between Iraq and it's neighbors and Iraq and international community. That's the opportunity the Arabs have. They know what Iraq used to be like so they have a major interest in contributing to the development of an Iraq that is fundamentally different. a source of stability and security, not of violence and subversion. And that's where Iraq wants to go. - The whole concept of democracy is, uh, it's the forces of good. Of humanitarian rule, rule of flow. You know, the army should be a tool that would do good. - This requires engagement. This is not something, "Hey, over to you. "You got it now, you can fire this gun. "You can fly an airplane, you can fly helicopters now. "Great, we're out of here. "Let us know how this goes 'cause we'll be watching it "on the news." - It takes work to maintain momentum, it's pure physics. If you don't do more work, the momentum, ultimately, stops, goes to rest. And we went through this once before. We had the momentum in 2003 and 2004, we lost the momentum, the insurgents seized the momentum by 2005, 2006, we took it back in 2007. This is what war is all about, it's not over yet. The momentum is in our direction, we should be happy with that, we should take care in our strategic decisions not to lose the momentum that cost us so many lives to gain.
