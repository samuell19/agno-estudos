The moon is like the moon, that is all. You are sick. Let us go within. They will say in Rome that you are mad. Let us go within. There is no other love... than God's love. There is no other love than love. There is no other love. There is no other. One of you will betray me. - Me! - Me! - Me! Viper, viper on the arm of she who today destroys all my dreams. You seemed the symbol the dreadful symbol of your wickedness. Mother, whom when she dreams, dreams the truth... ..dreamt of me the other night. ..the viper had already bit my breast... Viper on the arm of she who today destroys all my dreams. You seemed the symbol the dreadful symbol of your wickedness. Viper, viper on the arm of she who today destroys all my dreams. You seemed the symbol the dreadful symbol of your wickedness. ...of your wickedness. How beautiful is the Princess Salome tonight! Look at the moon. How strange the moon seems! She is like a woman rising from a tomb. She is like a dead woman looking for dead things. She has a strange look. She is like a little princess who wears a yellow veil, and whose feet are of silver. She is like a princess who has little white doves for feet. - One might fancy she was dancing. - She is like a woman who is dead. She moves very slowly. Who are those wild beasts howling? The Jews, they are always like that. - They are in dispute over their religion. - How beautiful is the Princess Salome tonight! Why do they dispute over their religion? I cannot tell. They are always doing it. - The Pharisees, for instance, say that there are angels, - You are always looking at her. You look at her too much. - and the Sadducees declare that angels do not exist. - It is dangerous to look at people in such a fashion. - I think it is ridiculous to dispute about such things. - Something terrible may happen. - The Tetrarch has a sombre aspect. - Yes; he has a sombre aspect. - He is looking at something. - He is looking at someone. - At whom is he looking? - I cannot tell. [How pale the Princess is!] Never have I seen her so pale. She is like the shadow of a white rose in a mirror of silver. You must not look at her. You look at her too much . Rejoice not, O land of Palestine because the rod is broken... ...a basil... She reels like a drunken woman, doesn't she? She is like a mad woman, isn't she? No! The moon is like the moon, that is all. Let us go within... There's nothing to do here for you. The Princess has hidden her face behind her fan! How sweet is the air here! Here, finally I can breathe. How pale she is! Never have I seen her so pale. Do not look at her, I pray you. Do not look at her. It is strange that the husband of my mother looks at me like that. She is like a dove that has strayed. She is like a narcissus trembling in the wind! She is like a silver flower. Why do you look at her? Oh, something terrible will happen. Has such a strange look tonight. Has such a strange look. Has such a strange look tonight. Isn't it true that the moon has a strange look? You must not look at her. You're always looking at her. The moon... No; the moon is like the moon, that is all. Let us go within. There's nothing to do here. Do you not see your daughter, how pale she is? You must not look at her, I have told you already. Let us go within. You are sick. They will say in Rome that you are mad. Let us go within, I tell you. Never have I seen her so pale. I have told you not to look at her. You're always saying the same thing! And I will repeat it. Do not listen to thy mother's voice. She is ever giving thee evil counsel. My daughter and I are of a royal race. "Then turning to my love I said" - As for thee, thy father... - "The dead are dancing with the dead." ...was a camel driver! He was a thief too. "The dust is whirling with the dust." Thou knowest well that it is true. How good to see the moon! Won't you be seated, Princess? Ah! How I loathe the Romans! They are rough people, and they give themselves the airs of noble lords. Why do you look at her? Oh, something terrible will happen. The Lord hath come. The Son of Man. ...in the river. ...in the forests. You look at her too much, You shouldn't look at people in such a fashion... ... something terrible will happen. Who was that who cried out? The prophet, Princess. The prophet? He of whom the Tetrarch is afraid? It's the prophet Iokanaan. Is it your pleasure that I bid them bring your litter, Princess? The night is so fair in the garden. He says terrible things about my mother, does he not? Yes. He says terrible things about her. Princess, the Tetrarch prays you to return to the feast! No! I will not return. Pardon me, Princess, but if you do not return some misfortune may happen. Is he an old man, this prophet? Princess, it is better to return. Allow me to lead you in. This prophet... is he an old man? There are those who say that he is Elias. Who is Elias? What answer may I give the Tetrarch from the Princess? And speaking... - The lord... - Princess. Princess. What a strange voice! I would just speak with him. The Tetrarch has forbidden you to speak with him. I wish to speak with him. It is impossible, Princess. I want it! Would it not be better to return to the banquet? No! I will never return. Bring forth this prophet. You are making me wait? It is not of us that you should ask this thing. Oh! what is going to happen? I am sure that something terrible will happen. Thou wilt do this thing for me, Narraboth. Wilt thou not? Thou wilt do this thing for me. I have ever been kind towards thee. I would but look at him, this strange prophet. Thou wilt do this thing for me. Narraboth. And tomorrow when I pass in my litter beneath the gateway of the idol-sellers I will let fall for thee a little flower. Princess, I cannot. I cannot! Thou wilt do this thing for me, Narraboth. And on the morrow when I shall pass in my litter by the bridge of the idol-buyers I will look at thee through the muslin veils. I will look at thee, Narraboth, it may be I will smile at thee. Let the prophet come forth. The Princess Salome desires to see him. If you want to live without cares you should be beware of women... Has come... that Lord... [They are vipers with black eyes] Has come the son... of that Lord. [With a look they can bewitch you] They have hidden themselves in the river and beneath the ground. Remember our past. You, beautiful! Daughter of a whore. Remember when... Where is he whose... cunt... ...whose cup... ...in a robe of silver Of whom is he speaking? No one can tell, Princess. Where is she who saw the images of men painted on the walls ..and gave herself unto lust... Is it of my mother that he is speaking? - Yes: it is of thy mother that he is speaking. - Where is she... ..who gave herself unto... Go, bid her rise up. Go bid her come... the Lord has in His hand... the scourge... But he is terrible... he is terrible! - You look at her too much... - Princess You shouldn't look at people in such fashion... they are like two black holes... burned by torches in a tapestry of Tyre. Who is this woman... ...looking at me? Do you think he will speak again? I will not have her look at me. How wasted he is! He is like a thin ivory statue. I'd say a statue of silver. I am sure he is chaste... ..as the moon is. Wherefore doth she look at me? - I pray you do not stay here. - Who is she? I want to know! Bid her begone, It is not to her that I would speak! Whore! I am Salome, daughter of Herodias... .. Princess of Jud?a. ... of a Whore Back! Daughter of Babylon! Back! Daughter of a Whore! Ahead! Back! People, ahead! Let's get back! Come not near the chosen of the Lord. Princess! Princess, thou who art like a garden of myrrh... Thy mother hath filled... Thou who art the dove of all doves... don't perfume your ass... Look not at this man, look not at him! Perfume not... your ass! Thy mother... Speak again, Iokanaan. Come not near me! Daughter of Sodom! Thy voice is as music to mine ear. ... to the desert, ... Son of Man. Is he as beautiful as thou art, Iokanaan? Angel of the Lord God, what dost thou here with thy sword? Whom seekest thou in this palace? In this... phallus? In this... palace. On the world. Iokanaan... Who speaketh? Who speaketh? Then come with me. You shameless... arse cheek! Golden arse! Back! Daughter of a Whore! Daughter of Babylon! Woman can't speak, I listen to the Words of the Lord! Back! Daughter of... - ...prays you to return to the... - Touch me not! - Princess... - Touch me not! ..the Tetrarch prays you to return to... Perfume not. Profane not... ...the temple. And love, you know, is a calamity... If you want to live without cares... of women you should beware... They are vipers with black eyes With a look they can bewitch you... ...of the angel of death. Daughter of a Whore! Whore yourself! Princess! Princess! Princess! Daughter of a Whore! Call unto Him by His name Call unto Him by His name Call unto him When He cometh to thee... Cursed be thou! Daughter of an incestuous mother! Cursed be thou! I will not look at thee more. Goodbye, Salome! Be thou accursed! Do not speak such words. I cannot endure it... Princess. Be thou accursed! Never! - "Come, great Egypt," - Daughter of a... "shake our stage" "with all thy mimic pageants!" "I have grown sick of unreal passions" "make the world thine Actium" "me thine Anthony!" Princess! The young Syrian has slain himself! The young captain has slain himself! He who has slain himself was my friend! I gave him a little box of perfumes and ear-rings wrought in silver and now he has killed himself! He was my brother, and nearer to me than a brother I gave him a little box full of perfumes ..and a ring of agate that he always wore on his hand. In the evening we were wont to walk by the river and among the almond-trees, and he used to tell me things of his country. He spake ever so low. The sound of his voice was like the sound of the flute. Also he took much joy gazing at himself in the river. I used to reproach him for that. The Tetrarch is very fond of wine. He has wine of three sorts. One which is brought from the Island of Samothrace and is purple like the cloak of C?sar. I have never seen C?sar. Where is Salome? Where is the Princess? You must not look at her! You are always looking at her! The moon has such a strange look, tonight. The moon has such a strange look, doesn't it? She reels like a drunken woman, doesn't she? She is like a mad woman, isn't she? Isn't she? No! The moon is like the moon, that is all. Let us go within. We have nothing to do here. I will stay here! Manasseh! Lay carpets there, Light torches. Bring forth the ivory tables, and the tables of jasper. The air here is sweet. I will drink more wine with my guests. We must show all honours to the ambassadors of C?sar. - It is not because of them that you remain. - Yes! The air here is very sweet. Come, Herodias, our guests await us. I have slipped! I have slipped in blood! Wherefore is there blood here? It is an ill omen. It is a very ill omen. Wherefore is there blood here? And this body... what is this body here? Think you I am like the King of Egypt, who gives no feast to his guests but that he shows them a corpse? I will not look on it. Take it away! Take it away! Take it away! Who is he? It is our captain, sire. I issued no order that he should be slain. He slew himself, sire. For what reason? I had made him captain of my guard! He slew himself. That seems strange. I had thought it was but the Roman philosophers who slew themselves Tigellinus? Is it not true that the philosophers in Rome slay themselves? There be some who slay themselves, sire. They are the Stoics. They are people of no cultivation. They are ridiculous people. I myself... regard them as being perfectly ridiculous. I too. It is ridiculous to kill one's-self. Everybody in Rome laughs at them. The Emperor has written a satire against them. He has written a satire against them? C?sar is wonderful. He can do everything... It is strange that the young Syrian has slain himself. It is really strange. I am sorry. Yes, yes. I am very sorry. Yes. For he was fair. He had very languorous eyes. I remember that I saw that he looked at Salome languorously. Truly, I thought he looked too much at her. There are others who look too much at her. His father was a king. I drove him from his kingdom. And of his mother, who was a queen, you, Herodias, made a slave. For that reason I made him my captain. I am sorry he is dead. Why have you left the body here? I will not look at it, away with it! It is cold. Here it is cold. It is cold here... There is a wind blowing. Is there not a wind blowing? No; there is no wind. There is wind... ..There is wind. And I hear in the air something that is like the beating of wings, Do you not hear it? Do you not hear it? I hear nothing. I hear it no longer. But I heard it. It was the blowing of the wind. Now, it has passed away. But no, I hear it again. I tell you there is nothing. You are ill. Let us go within. I am not ill. It is your daughter who is sick. Never have I seen her so pale. I have told you not to look at her! Pour forth the wine! Salome, come drink a little wine with me. I have here a wine that is exquisite. C?sar himself sent it me. Dip into it thy little red lips, that I may drain the cup. I am not thirsty, Tetrarch. You hear how she answers me? She does right. Why are you always gazing at her? Bring me ripe fruits. Salome, come and eat fruits with me. I love to see the mark of thy little teeth. bite but a little of this... I am not hungry, Tetrarch. You see how you have brought up this daughter of yours! My daughter and I are of a royal race... ..as for thee, thy father was a camel driver! He was a thief and a robber to boot! - Thou liest! - Thou knowest well that it is true. Salome, come and sit next to me. I will give thee the throne of thy mother. I am not tired, Tetrarch. You see in what regard she holds you. Bring me... Bring me... What is it that I desire? I don't remember anymore. I don't remember... Ah! Now I remember. Now. The Lord, God... come up against her a multitude of men... It is thus.. ...will wipe out... ...and that all women... Bid him be silent. I will not listen to his voice. This man is for ever hurling insults against me. He has said nothing against you. Besides, he is a very great prophet. I do not believe in prophets. Can a man tell what will come to pass? No man knows it. Also he is for ever insulting me. But I think you are afraid of him... I am afraid of no man! Yes. You are afraid of him! If you are not why do you not deliver him to the Jews who for these six months past have been clamouring for him? The day is at hand The day of the Lord Make him be silent. He wearies me. upon the mountains... the feet of He who shall be the Saviour of the world... Tigellinus... What does that mean? The Saviour of the world? It is a title that C?sar adopts. But C?sar is not coming into Jud?a. It is a title that C?sar adopts. Make them be silent. They weary me. But C?sar cannot come. He is riddled with gout. They say that his feet are like the feet of an elephant. Also there are reasons of state. He who leaves Rome loses Rome. He will not ever come. How be it, C?sar is lord, he will come if it is his pleasure. Nevertheless, I think he will not come. The prophet spoke not of C?sar, sire. Of whom then did he speak? Concerning Messias, who hath come. Messias hath not come! He hath come, and everywhere He worketh miracles! Miracles! I do not believe in miracles. I have seen too many. My scourge. He changed water into wine He healed two lepers He hath healed blind people also How these men weary me! They are stupid! They are completely stupid! The scourge! Well! My scourge? You have a dreamer's look. You must not dream. It is only sick people who dream. There is also the miracle of the daughter of Jairus. Those men are mad. They have looked too long at the moon. Command them to be silent. What is this miracle of the daughter of Jairus? The daughter of Jairus was dead. This man raised her from the dead. He raises people from the dead? I do not wish Him to do that. I forbid Him to do that. I forbid Him to do that! He cannot do that. I suffer no man to raise the dead. This Man must be found and told that I forbid Him to raise the dead. Where is this Man at present? He is in every place, my lord. No matter! But let them find Him, and tell Him from me that I will not suffer him that I will not suffer him to raise the dead. To change water into wine... to heal the lepers and the blind... He may do these things if He will. I say nothing against these things. In truth... I hold healing a leper to be a kindly deed But no man shall raise the dead... It would be terrible if the dead came back. The wanton one! Command him to be silent! The daughter of Babylon! But it is infamous! Well! My scourge? You have a dreamer's look. You must not dream. You hear what he says against me? You suffer him to revile she who is your wife! He did not speak your name. You know well that it is I whom he seeks to revile. And I am your wife, am I not? In truth, dear and noble Herodias, you are my wife, and before that you were the wife of my brother. It was thou didst snatch me from his arms. I was stronger than he was, no? But let us not talk of that matter. Even if the prophet is right that on account of it a misfortune will come... Let us not speak of it. Noble Herodias, we are not mindful of our guests. Fill my cup, my beloved. Fill the great goblets of silver, the great goblets of glass. I will drink to C?sar. There are Romans here. We must drink to C?sar. Do you not see your daughter, how pale she is? What is it to you if she is pale or not? - Never have I seen her so pale. - You must not look at her. On that day the sun shall turn black... like a sackcloth of hair and the moon shall become like blood I should like to see that day of which he speaks when the moon shall become like blood... when the stars shall fall upon the earth like unripe figs. This prophet talks like a drunken man... but I cannot suffer the sound of his voice. I hate his voice! - Command him to be silent. - I cannot understand what it is that he sayeth, I cannot understand it, but it may be an omen. I do not believe in omens. He speaks like a drunken man. It may be he is drunk with the wine of God. What wine is that, the wine of God? From what vineyards is it gathered? In what wine-press may one find it? Tigellinus, when you were at Rome of late, did the Emperor... speak with you... on the subject of... - On what subject, my lord? - I asked you a question, did I not? I have forgotten what I would have asked you. You are looking again at my daughter. You must not look at her. I have already said so. You say nothing else. I say it again. And that restoration of the Temple about which they have talked so much, will anything be done? They say that the veil of the Sanctuary has disappeared It was thyself didst steal it. Thou speakest at random. I will not stay here. Let us go within. Salome, dance for me. I have no desire to dance, Tetrarch. I will not have her dance! Salome, daughter of Herodias, dance for me. Peace. Leave her alone. I command thee to dance for me. I will not dance, Tetrarch. You see how she obeys you. What is it to me whether she dances or not? It is nought to me. Tonight I am happy. I am exceedingly happy. Never have I been so happy. Wherefore should I not be happy? C?sar, who is lord of the world, loves me well. He has just sent me most precious gifts. Also he has promised me to summon to Rome the King of Cappadocia, who is mine enemy. Also he owes me money that he will not repay. It may be that Caesar will crucify him, in Rome He is able to do all things that he has a mind to do, C?sar is lord. Therefore I do well to be happy. There is nothing in the world that can mar my happiness. Did you hear what he says about you? He says that you shall be eaten of worms. It is not of me that he speaks. He never speaks against me. He speaks of the King of Cappadocia; who is mine enemy. Also he owes me money that he will not repay. It is he who shall be eaten of worms, not I. This prophet has never spoken word against me, save that... I sinned in taking as my wife the wife of my brother. For, in truth, you are sterile. I am sterile, I? You say that? You that are ever looking at my daughter. You that would have her dance for your pleasure? You speak as a fool. I have borne a child. You have gotten no child, not from one of your slaves. It is you who are sterile, not I. Peace, woman! I say that you are sterile. You have borne me no child and the prophet says that our marriage is not a true marriage. He says that it is a marriage of incest, a marriage that will bring evils... I fear he is right; I am sure that he is right. But it is not the hour to speak of these things. Now I am happy. I am very happy. Never have I been so happy. There is nothing I lack. I am glad you are of so fair a humour tonight. But it is late. Let us go within. Do not forget that we hunt at sunrise. To C?sar's ambassadors all honours must be shown, must they not? Salome, dance for me. I beseech thee. I beseech thee. Tonight I am sad. I am very sad. Never have I been so sad. Dance for me, Salome, I beseech thee. If thou dancest for me... ..thou may ask of me what thou wilt, and I will give it thee. even unto the half of my kingdom. Will you give me whatsoever I shall ask of you, Tetrarch? Whatsoever! Whatsoever... Do not dance, my daughter. Whatsoever... even unto the half of my kingdom. You swear it, Tetrarch? I swear it. I swear it... Do not dance, my daughter. By what will you swear this, Tetrarch? By my life, by my crown, by my gods. You have sworn an oath, Tetrarch. I have sworn an oath... Whatsoever I shalt ask... Do not dance, my daughter. Thou wilt be passing fair as a queen, Salome, if it pleases thee to ask for the half of my kingdom. Will she not be fair as a queen? There is an icy wind! It is cold here! wherefore I hear... I hear in the air this beating of wings? One might fancy a bird. A huge black bird that hovers over the terrace. Why can I not see it, this bird? The beating of its wings is terrible. The breath of the wind off its wings is terrible. It is a chill wind. No, but it is not cold, it is hot. It is hot. I am choking. Pour water on my hands. Loosen my mantle. It is hot. I am choking. It is cold! There is an icy wind. No, It is hot. It is hot! I am choking! Give me... Give me snow to eat... It's cold here. My mantle. Loosen my mantle. Nay, but leave it. No. It is cold here, it is cold... It is my garland that hurts me, my garland of roses. The flowers are like fire. They have burned my forehead. I can breathe now. How red those petals are! They are like stains of blood ..on the cloth. It is not wise to find symbols in everything that one sees. It makes life too full of terrors. It were better to say that... stains of blood ..are as lovely as... rose-petals. It were better so. So it were better. It were better so. But we will not speak of this. We must not speak of this. Tonight I'm happy, I am very happy. Never have I been so happy. Your daughter is going to dance for me. I will not have her dance. Wilt thou not dance for me, Salome? I will dance for you, Tetrarch. She is going to dance for me. Thou doest well... Thou doest well... ..to dance for me, Salome. And when thou hast danced for me, forget not to ask of me whatsoever thou hast a mind to ask. Whatsoever thou shalt desire I will give it thee even to the half of my kingdom. I have sworn it, have I not? Thou hast sworn it, Tetrarch. And I have never failed of my word. I am not of those who break their oaths. I know not how to lie. I am the slave of my word, and my word is the word of a king. The King of Cappadocia had ever a lying tongue, but he is no true king. He is a coward. Also he owes me money that he will not repay. He has even insulted my ambassadors! He has spoken words that were wounding. But C?sar will crucify him when he comes to Rome. I know that C?sar will crucify him. Otherwise he will die, being eaten by worms. The prophet has prophesied it. Salome, wherefore dost thou tarry? The seven veils... and my slaves take from off my feet my sandals. Thou art to dance with naked feet! 'Tis well! Well, well, well... Thy little feet will be like white doves. They will be like little white flowers that dance upon the trees... No, no, she is going to dance on blood! There is always blood here spilt on the ground. She must not dance on blood. It is an evil omen. What is it to thee if she dances on blood? Thou hast waded deep enough in it. What is it to me? Look at the moon! She has become red as blood. The prophet prophesied that the moon would become as blood. The moon... The moon has become red as blood. Did he not prophesy it? All of ye heard him. The moon has become red as blood. Do ye not see it? Do ye not see it? Oh, yes, I see it well. The stars are falling like unripe figs, are they not? And the sun is becoming black like sackcloths of hair. And the kings of the earth are afraid. That at least one can see. The prophet is justified of his words in that at least. The kings of the earth are afraid. Let us go within. You are sick. They will say in Rome that you are mad. Let us go within, I tell you. Who is this who cometh from Edom... Let us go within. The voice of that man maddens me. I will not have my daughter dance while he is continually crying out. I will not have her dance while you look at her in this fashion. In a word, I will not have her dance. Do not rise, my wife, my queen. It will avail thee nothing. I will not go within till she hath danced. Dance, Salome, dance. Dance for me. Do not dance, my daughter. I am ready, Tetrarch. Abat-jour you are shining a blue light from above you are sighing who knows why... Abat-jour while you spread the blue light also you perhaps are looking for who is no more. Ah! Wonderful! Wonderful! You see that your daughter has danced for me. ..your daughter has danced for me. Come near, Salome... ..come near, that I may give thee thy fee. I pay a royal price to those who dance for my pleasure. I will pay thee royally... I will give thee whatsoever thy soul desireth. What wouldst thou have, Salome? I would... that they bring me... presently in a silver charger... In a silver charger? Charming! What is it that thou wouldst have in a silver charger? O sweet and fair Salome, thou that art fairer than all the daughters of Jud?a? What wouldst thou have them bring thee in a silver charger? Tell me. Whatsoever it may be, thou shalt receive it. My treasures belong to thee. The head of... Salome, what is it...? No! Do not listen to thy mother's voice. She is ever giving thee evil counsel. Do not heed her. It is not my mother's voice that I heed ..it is for mine own pleasure that I ask for the head of... in a silver charger. You have sworn, Herod Forget not that you have sworn an oath. ... ask of me something else. Ask of me the half of my kingdom, and I will give it thee. But ask not of me what thy lips have asked. I ask of you the head of... No, no, I will not... I will not. No! Peace, woman! It is not to you I speak. Peace! Speak not to me! Come, Salome! let us be as friends. You should be reasonable, isn't it true? Isn't it true that you should be reasonable? I have ever been kind toward thee. I have ever loved thee. It may be that I have loved thee too much. Therefore ask not this thing of me. This is an awful thing to ask. The head of a man... It is too awful! The head of a man... Surely, I think thou art jesting. The head of a man that is cut... is... is... is ill to look upon. It is not right that the eyes of a virgin should look upon such a thing. What pleasure couldst thou have in it? Salome, hearken to me. I have an emerald, a great emerald and round that the minion of C?sar has sent unto me. When thou lookest through this emerald thou canst see... thou canst see that which passeth afar off. C?sar himself carries such an emerald when he goes to the circus. But it is the larger. Salome, it is the larger. It is the largest emerald in the whole world. C?sar himself doesn't possess such a large emerald. Ask it of me and I will give it thee. I demand the head... Thou art not listening. Thou art not listening. Suffer me to speak, Salome. The head... Thou wouldst not have that. The head... Thou sayest that but to trouble me, because I have looked at thee and ceased not this night. I have looked at thee and ceased not this night. It is true, I have looked at thee. Thy beauty has troubled me. Thy beauty has grievously troubled me. And I have looked at thee overmuch. But I will look at thee no more. One should not look at anything. Neither at things, nor at people. Only in mirrors is it well to look, for mirrors do but show us masks. Bring wine! Give me the head. I thirst... Salome, let us be as friends. Bethink thee... What would I say? What was it? Salome, nay but come nearer to me; I fear thou wilt not hear my words. Thou knowest my white peacocks, Salome. My beautiful white peacocks. My snow peacocks. That walk in the garden between the myrtles and the tall cypress-trees. Their beaks are gilded with gold and the grains that they eat are smeared with gold and their feet are stained with purple. When they cry out the rain falls and when they spread their tails the moon shows herself in the heavens. Two by two they walk between the cypress-trees and the black myrtles, and each has a slave to tend it. Sometimes they fly across the trees and anon they couch in the grass, and round the pools of the water. There are not in all the world birds so wonderful. In the whole world there is no king who has birds so wonderful. C?sar himself has no birds so fair as my birds. They will follow thee whithersoever thou goest, Salome. and in the midst of them thou wilt be like... like unto the moon in a cloud... Like unto the moon... in the midst of a great white cloud. I have but a hundred, I will give them all to thee. Thou art not listening to me I am altogether calm. I have a collar of pearls, set in four rows. They are like unto moons chained with rays of silver. They are even as half a hundred moons caught in a golden net. They have rested on the ivory breast of a queen. When thou wearest them Thou shalt be as fair as a queen. I have amethysts of two kinds; one that is black like wine, and one that is red like wine that one has coloured with water. I have topazes yellow as are the eyes of tigers and topazes that are pink as the eyes of a wood-pigeon and green topazes that are as the eyes of cats. I have opals that burn always, with a flame that is cold as ice opals that make men's minds sad, and afraid of the shadows. I have onyxes like the eyeballs of a dead woman. I have moonstones that change colour when the moon changes and are wan when they see the sun. I have sapphires big like eggs, and as blue as blue flowers. The sea wanders within them, and the moon comes never to trouble the blue of their waves. I have chrysolites and beryls, and chrysoprases and rubies. I have sardonyx and hyacinth stones, and stones of chalcedony I will give them all unto thee, Salome. All, and all other things. ..the King of Numidia... ..of ostrich feathers... I have a crystal, into which it is not lawful for a woman to look, nor may young men behold it until they have been beaten with rods. In a coffer of nacre... I have three wondrous turquoises. He who wears them on his forehead can imagine things which are not and he who carries them in his hand can turn the fruitful woman into a woman that is barren. These are treasures of great... They are treasures above all price. But this is not all. In an ebony coffer I have two cups of amber that are like apples of gold. If an enemy pour poison into these cups they become like apples of silver. In a coffer incrusted with amber I have sandals incrusted with glass. I have mantles that have been brought from the land of the Serer and bracelets decked about with almandine and with jade that come from the city of Euphrates Salome, what desirest thou? Tell me the thing that thou desirest, and I will give it thee. All that thou askest, save one thing only. Give me the head. I will give thee the mantle of the high priest. I will give thee the veil of the sanctuary. Hereafter let no king swear an oath! If he keep it not, it is terrible, and if he keep it... it is terrible also. Who has taken my ring? Who has drunk my wine? Some one has... Manasse! Issachar! Ozias! Put out the torches! I will not look at things anymore. I will not suffer things looking at me. Put out the torches! Hide the sun! Hide the moon! Hide the stars! I begin to be afraid. Subtitles: MENiSCUS
