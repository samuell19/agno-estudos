[in Spanish] [in Spanish] [Violet a sighs] [kneading dough] [in Spanish] [laughs softly] [in English] How much did you say you paid? [Gaby in English] Fifteen. Cents, I hope? - No. Dollars. Ma! - [Violet a] Mm-hmm. You paid three weeks of ice cream money for some crackhead... She is not a crackhead! You know it's mathematically impossible... [in Spanish] [Gaby] And for your information, she has predicted a lot of stuff that has come true. - Really? Like what? - Today, how many platanitos were in the ba... - [chuckles] You're joking? - Ma! [in Spanish] [Abu in Spanish] - [in English] This year. - Hmm. - Shut up! - [Violet a groans] [in Spanish] [in English] She said to keep playing the numbers Abu always plays. [Ceci] Clever. Watch, when we win, you're going to be sorry for not believing me. Okay. Okay. Just warning you. Okay. [Violet a in Spanish] [Abu] Hmm. [Abu] Mm. [in Spanish] - [in English] What are you doing? - Nothing. Nothing? Then why'd you jump when I came in? School stuff... you caught me off guard. Okay. - Give me... - You're... - Give me that! - Shh! - I thought... - Shh! - Did you tell Mom? - No. I don't wanna worry her. Ooh. Mrs. Perfect's got a bad side! [in Spanish] [in English] This isn't bad?! - [in Spanish] - Ah! [in English] Bad is bad. No exceptions! [in Spanish] - [in English] What? - Don't do it. It's fine, Gaby. Relax. Go do your homework. [in Spanish] - Ceci? - Hmm? [in Spanish] [beads clinking] [in Spanish] [in English] Hey. [Ceci in Spanish] [laughing] [in English] Seriously, though. When are you gonna stop carrying that with you? You look like a weirdo. If you stare at it long enough, it kinda looks like a bridge. So? So it inspires me. Reminds me that I will build them. Like, for real build them or like in your mind? Both. Okay, freak. [scoffs] But you can't build a bridge to Venezuela, home girl... you stuck. [guitar music playing] [Ceci in Spanish] [indistinct singing] [Ceci] [no audible cheering] [woman in English] I see most of your classmates regularly. We've locked down their choices together, but I haven't seen you in here all year. I... - I just... - At this rate, you're gonna have to start in the spring and not this coming fall. I actually wanted to ask you about Florida Bright Futures. You're not thinking of staying in Florida for school...? - Well... - Most of your top choices are out of state. - I know, but... - María, with a GPA like yours, you really shouldn't be anywhere short of an Ivy League... I know, um... But... [woman] Hmm... Think you'll get homesick? [clicks tongue] Most of you kids do. American kids? [chuckles] They don't care. - They just can't wait to get out the house! - [both chuckle] - Yeah... - And that speech? I need you to come in more often so I can see it. [Ceci in Spanish] - [in English] Got it. Here it is. Twice divorced. - Yes. All right, well, I see here that your latest husband, Brent, removed your... Well, I am inquiring about my current adjustment. Okay. I see. Let me check. Oh. Um. There seems to have been a mix-up because of your last... Uh, because of your maiden name. It hadn't been adjusted? Not that I can see, but I will do it now. - Please. - [keyboard clacking] - All right, done. Sorry for the delay. - A three-year delay. - I do apologize, but we have had a serious back up. - I can see that. But with this small correction, looks like you are in line for final review between today and tomorrow. You should be getting a response within the next few weeks. - How many weeks? - We are experiencing a back up, ma'am, so I can't be sure, but within the next few weeks you should be getting a response in the mail. But if you could at least give me an estimate... Sorry, ma'am. That's all the information I have. But you can always call our hotline for updates. One sixty-two! [automated voice] Now serving B-3-0-9 at window number 13. - Now serving S-9... - [Ceci in Spanish] [teacher muffled in English] María? Care to join us? María?! - [school bell rings] - [sighs] Cecilia. María Cecilia. Your brain frying from all that brainstorming? Talking to yourself now? No, it's just... - names are important. - Okay. So why don't you stand up for yourself and tell people what to call you? I... I... [mocks stammering] What you stuttering for? You better learn to stand up for yourself and get things off your chest. Keeping things in causes throat cancer. - [clicks tongue] - For real. And girl, you been here more than half your life. You should be used to people chopping up your name by now. I know. Or if it really bothers you, say something. [backpack zips] - Don't think I forgot, valedic-freak! - Oh! [both in Spanish] [laughter] [in English] Guess what?! I just got my full ride to USC for track! - What?! - Yes, girl! Oh, my God! - So, uh, party at my house? - Oh, hell, yeah. My parents are throwing me a huge party after graduation. It's gonna be off the chain. You should come, too, Ceci. Oh, I'll make sure she gets there. This is huge! - I know. Yo, I was freaking out. - I know, you were driving me nuts. - Well, it was really hard competition. - You're the best runner I know. I'm the only runner you know. [laughs] -True. - Whatever. - [school bell rings] Oh, shit. We're late. Okay. My bad. Gotta go. - Ey. I'm proud of you! [laughs] - Thank you! [squeals] - Bye, Ceci. Happy birthday! - Thanks. And congratulations! - [imitating Ceci] Oh, hey, congratulations. - [Ceci mumbles] [Yakuanda laughs] [train rumbling] [Ceci in Spanish] [sighs] [crickets chirping] [Ceci] [Violet a clicks tongue] [Ignacio on phone] [in English] Hello?

We dress up on Wednesdays. [in English] Sorry. I forgot. Well, don't be sorry! Go change. Gaby, I really don't want to. Come on, we'll never win with you dressed like a slob. We'll never win regardless. Hey! [whispers] Sorry. What does what we wear have to do with anything? It's just... it's bad juju. Come on, please. - Is this gonna go on all year? - 'Til we win. - Come on. Hurry up. - [groans] - [Gaby] Pick your best outfit. - [Ceci sighs] [singing in Spanish] [cheering] -[Yakuanda in English] I can't believe - I know that long-ass song. - [in Spanish] [in English] You've been hanging out with us for too long. - [Augustina chuckles] - Okay, come on! - What? - [in Spanish] [Ceci clicks tongue] Oh! [in Spanish] [laughing] - [in English] I'll explain later. - Okay. [woman on TV in Spanish] [crickets chirping] [pencil scratching] [engine revs] - [clicks tongue] - [pencil scratches] - [sighs] - [engine revs] [automated voice in English] We apologize for the delay. All of our agents are still assisting other calls. - Ow! - [in Spanish] Hmm? [inhales] - [man in English] All right, ma'am. Sorry about that. - [sighs] No problem. - So it looks like it is finally being reviewed... - Oh, thanks God. And you should be getting a response in the mail within one to 12 weeks. - Twelve? - That is correct, due to the high volume of callers. If there is anything else we can help you with, please visit our website. - Well, if at least you... - And don't forget to fill out the survey on our service! [disconnect tone] Okay. [in Spanish] [Ceci in Spanish] Nah... [sighs] [in English] Supervisor said the same thing. Gotta be the original. Sorry, honey. Okay. Thank you. María! But I'll see if there's anything I can do. If there is, you'll get a email. [Ceci in Spanish] [laughing] [birds chirping] [in English] Yeah, I went during lunch. [Yakuanda] Damn. Yup. [sighs] - Yo! Defender of the people! - Hey! - [Ashley] Look at my dorm! - [Yakuanda] Oh, my God! Look! I got my dad to make me a cute little neon 305 sign to hang over the bed. [Yakuanda in Spanish] - [in English] Did you figure yours out yet? [Yakuanda clicks tongue, scoffs] You know my mom's tripping. - Trying to make me stay home for school. - [Ashley sighs] But I've been fighting the good fight. - Your girl's gonna be a lawyer someday! - [laughter] Listen, you gon' build yo' bridges, I'm gonna fight injustices, and you gon' run after everybody. Trifecta. - Watch out, America. - [laughter] - You going to Jabari's tonight? - [gasps] I got my mom's car! - Scoop me? - Yeah! Duh. We should have a designated driver, though. True. Oh, no, I can't. - Come on! - [scoffs] You don't even drink! - I don't. - So then? - Well, I... - You what? - I can't. - Ugh! Lame. Seriously. Come on. - [in Spanish] - [in English] Oh, shit.

Final disbursement scholarship letters come in today! - [screams] - [Ashley] Get it, girl! Ey, don't go spending your afternoon brainstorming your brain to death, María Cecilia Lopez Lugo Martinez Rodriguez Ramirez... [inhales] Perez! - See ya! - [Ashley laughs] Bye. [Ceci in Spanish] [sighs] [man in English] Vee! Brent. What are you doing here? I, uh... I live around here. I know. You're stunning as ever. Uh, I... uh... I thought I saw you over there at the light - and so I wanted to come over here and talk to you. - I'm working. Vee, I feel really bad about what I did. Here, let me... let me help you. Let me help you. Yeah, there, yeah. Will you, um... do you think you could give me a chance to show you that I've changed? [trunk thuds] [in Spanish] - [in English] Hello?! - Sorry! So? - Car wash boss. He didn't ask any ques... - Shh! - They don't even speak English! - I don't care, keep your voice down. [loud whisper] Okay, so did he? No. I told you it was just to shelve it. - And what about Miami-Dade? - Nothing yet. So then, what does that mean? - Out of state. - So? - Nothing, I don't wanna talk about it. - Fine. - You're a genius! - Hmm. You are! Mine's going to be the best in the class. Mm, not so fast... [in Spanish] little butterfly. - [in English] Put it back together! - What?! How are you gonna do your presentation if you don't know how it works? Ugh!

[Ignacio in Spanish] [birds chirping] [Ceci in Spanish] [guitar music playing] [sighs] [phone buzzing] [Violet a sighs] [Gaby] [Ceci] [sighs] [Ceci] [liquid pouring] [sighs] [touch tones beeping] [line ringing] - [Ignacio in English] Hello? - [in Spanish] [Ignacio in Spanish] Hmm. [phone beeps] [Ceci in Spanish] [in English] There are lotto drawings on Saturdays, too! That doubles our chances. Don't tell me we have to dress up on weekends now, too. Duh. Gonna go get that ticket. [in Spanish] [in English] Make it casual Saturdays! Maybe it brings better luck. [Ceci in Spanish] [Violet a] Hmm? [whispers] [both] [Abu] Oh! - [Gaby] - [Abu] [Ceci in Spanish] [Gaby in English] Maggy, Saturdays too! - That's right! - [both laugh] [wind blowing] [Ceci in Spanish] [both] [in English] Exactly. [laughs] What does that have to do with anything? [scoffs] I don't know. Those things are truth. I still feel some type of way every time I see Jabari in fourth period. - [scoffs] - [laughs] That's different. I think he should come here and they should get back together. - Who? - Your pop. - Oh. It doesn't work like that. - Why not? - He has work there. - So? He could work here. He's a lawyer there. Well, there's no laws over there right now, so what's he lawyering? True. [inhales] That place is twisted. [exhales] I know. Hurts to be there. Hurts to be out. Ooh, that's good. Write about that. - [bus brakes hiss] - What was that? What? I don't know. You don't think we could get busted for trespassing here, do you? [clicks tongue] No, scaredy-cat. [Ceci in Spanish] [in English] Brent. - [purse zips] - [in Spanish] [in English] No. [in Spanish] [sighs, in English] No. [in Spanish] [sighs] [sighs] [sighs] [birds chirping] [sprays] [whispers in English] Shit. [grunts] [spraying] [coughing] Hi. Come in. Come in. Come on in. Here, I'll put the chair here for ya. There you go! It's good that you came. Thank you. [Brent grunts] Oh... Yeah. Oh, this... - [tray clatters] - Oh! Sorry. Okay. Ah. Hmm [sighs] It's... [Ceci in Spanish] [in English] That's gonna be like 20 minutes, okay? - All right, that's fine. - Here you go. No change. - Yo! - Hey! Look what I inherited from my ugly-ass brother for campus! [chuckles] That's so cool. Wanna be my first passenger? Uh... Don't tell me you're scared of being towed. - Can't we get, like, pulled over for that? - What? No. I mean, it's a bike. - I know, but still... - Ah, I don't wanna hear it. You have no choice. You're coming with me. But I'm not off 'til like 20, so... [huffs] I'll wait for your scaredy-cat ass. Ha-ha! [chuckles] [Ceci in Spanish] [in English] I mean, if it makes you feel better, sure. But... [scoffs] even if I didn't... fuck with your petition again, which I won't... I would never do that again. It'd be pretty difficult for you to keep that agreement, you know, legally. For my peace of mind. Okay. We'll do that. Sure. Uh... [chuckles] I wanna show you that I've changed. In due time, I will. I'm a man of God now. [Ceci in Spanish] - [laughter] - [indistinct shouting] - [Ceci in Spanish] - [laughter continues] [in English] Go! Go! [Ceci in Spanish] - [laughter continues] - [guitar music playing] [in English] There you go! [Yakuanda] I'm alive! [laughter] [Ceci in Spanish] [Yakuanda in Spanish] [man singing in Spanish] [Yakuanda] [singing continues] [Yakuanda in English] That wasn't so bad, huh, Hesitaty Hennesy? - No. - Told ya. I'm not graying prematurely for no reason. There is wisdom sprouting from this head. - [laughs] Shut up. - [laughs] It's true! Ooh. That's good! [laughter] [Yakuanda] Wait. Rice, really? [Yakuanda] Whoa. Sky's blazing tonight, right? [Ceci] Our spot is Miami's best kept secret. [Yakuanda] Psh. We're Miami's best kept secret. [laughs] - Especially you with your secretive behind. [in Spanish] [in English] That's real. You know... I never say this to you, but... it feels so good to be able to switch language and you still understand me. - Mm. - Like... I always feel that people only know half of me if I can't also speak to them in Spanish. I always say the same thing. [singing continues] Yo. I'm really sorry about that whole designated driver thing earlier. It's all right. [Gaby in Spanish] - [sighs] - [Violet a] [TV playing] - [Ceci] - [Gaby] [woman on TV speaking Spanish] [Ceci mumbles] [phone ringing] [gasps] [ringing continues] [phone beeps] [in English] Hello?

I tried to plead for you, but it... it didn't work. You can't keep working here.

Was that you? [inhales] Maybe. What? What, I couldn't finish myself off. I needed to hear your voice. - Hey, hey, hey. Come on now. Come on. - [grunting] Come on. Give me some of this shit! - [whimpers] - [man] Hey! [whistles] Fuck. I'm sorry. Sorry. I'm sorry. - [Brent grunts] - [sighs] [guitar music playing] [woman on TV speaking Spanish] [Ceci in Spanish] - [Abu] - [Violet a] [birds chirping] [vehicle passes] [phone ringing] - [phone beeps] - [in English] Hello? [Ignacio in Spanish] [Ignacio laughs] [Ignacio sighs] [knocking on door] [in English] Hi, Gabs. [whispers] Hey. [in Spanish] [hand pats] [in English] But I still don't know if I'll have the guts to do it. [Yakuanda] I think you said this one was your favorite. - Is it? - Yeah! It's the first ever iron arch one. It's a mystery how they did it because so many others had tried and failed. But... someway, somehow... they did it. [whispers] You got this. - [Ceci in Spanish] - [guitar music playing] [panting] [Violet a] [Ceci] [man in English] Ladies and gentlemen, without further ado, - your valedictorian, María Lopez. - [Ceci in Spanish] [applause] [music continues] [sobs softly] [in Spanish] - [guitar music playing] - [man singing in Spanish] [music ends]
