This film was made during the summer and fall of 1965 in Babelsberg, Berlin, Greifswald, Schwielowsee in the area of Mark Brandenburg and on the island of Zingst. It was mutilated by its editors, banned and remained incomplete. Günter Ost restored the original version in January and February 1990. This requires the active participation of us all. We are faced in the university with exactly the same problem soon to confront you teachers: how are we to find the right balance between imparting knowledge and teaching people to think. It is clear to us that we may encounter resistance as with any change. But who, if not our new young teachers, can give shape and form to this endeavor? I can't do it! I really can't! I wish you success in your worthy, difficult teaching profession. Esteemed professors, esteemed lecturers, esteemed guests, dear friends. Oh well. Today is a fine day. I'm happy that we made it. Thank you. Thanks to the secretary who gave us an advance when we were broke, even with cash from her own pocket. Thanks to the janitors. It was always warm, except when there wasn't any coal. And thanks to the cook and the kitchen staff, even their stew tasted good. Have I forgotten anyone? Thanks to him too. But these are just words. Our true thanks will be shown by our work in towns and villages. We are to pass on what we've learned, we're to impart knowledge. But as we've just heard, knowledge is growing rapidly in all areas. What's sufficient today won't be enough tomorrow. So we must teach how to learn, how to think for oneself. If we find breadth unreachable, we'll go for the depth... or for the heights. But let's keep our feet on the ground. Let's keep sight of our goals. Let's use all our effort, our enthusiasm, and all our modest understanding to make life easier, more graceful and more cheerful. You see, some great words have slipped out after all. Let's make sure this isn't just words. The proof is in the pudding, as the poet says. Let's start! What's up here? - I've... just made a correction. - That's not allowed! Where would that end? - What do you want? - I'm looking for the principal. - What for? - I'm the new teacher. - He's not here. - Where can I find him? I don't know. He drove off. Try the lake. The holiday games. The school's out there. - Thank you. - Not at all. Hello. - Excuse me. - Okay. - What are you doing? - I'm playing. - Where are the games? - Gone. - Why gone? - Just gone. Gone home. Did you want to join in? Because I'm not as big as you? You can't see how big I am. I'm sitting! Perhaps you only look so big from down here. The road goes on. Why should I go on if no one's left? - Because you're a pain. - Lout. There's the bed. Here's the key. If you need to pee, outside in the bushes. - Bye, Shorty. - Bye, landlord. It's really wine. Stop there! Now, now! Can't a guy just... Oh... - I thought someone wanted... - Don't worry, no one wants. How did you get in? Through the wall. So. Daddy's going shopping. Would you be so kind as to put the spuds on, please? They're good cooked too. Going fishing? - Take me too? - No. Oh yes, please. Well, all right. If you want to catch a cold... I'll get dressed! Eels? No, sea snakes. Now for a drop of red wine. I was so thirsty. Well, never mind. - Ouch, damn! - Grab your earlobes, quickly. My name's Karla. Please call me that. All right... Karlie. Because you're so little. - And what's your name? - My name's Kaspar. - Excuse me? - Kaspar! Soupy-Kaspar. - Not that I'd recommend it. - Cheeky, for a teacher. Stolen always tastes good. Oh, you did... The eels are... I thought you were one of the fishermen. But Karlie, could these hands steal? Theft. And probably from a collective. Are you going to puke? Eat up first! It's good soup. A shame to waste it. The soup can't help it. Karlie must become a Karl! Or the kids will spit on your head. Now who's the Soupy-Kaspar? The song of Soupy-Karla! Young Karla she was in great health. A fleshy broad and barrel-round Had cheeks all rosy-red and fresh, Was fond of soup – it added flesh. But one day she did make a row: I will not eat that soup, oh no! No, I won't eat that soup she cried, No, I will never eat that soup. The second day was moan and groan, And Karla was all skin and bone! No longer was she rosy red. The third day she was pale and dead. Boing! One for Senior Teacher Karla. One for Principal Karla. One for School Inspector Karla. And one for Education Minister Kaspar Stein. Good girl. What about me? - I don't sleep with thieves. - Who mentioned sleeping? Look, you ate the soup. You knew the eels were stolen. Yes, you tricked me. I'm annoyed about it. In for a penny, in for a pound. Just don't tell anyone, okay? No! Tomorrow you go and fix things. - Go where? - To the fishermen. - Are you kidding? - I mean it. Yes, I think you really do. How did you get that idea? Just a few eels! A few eels! It was theft! No, one must be honest. Rubbish. I can't suddenly be honest. Dear fishermen, I've stolen eels, already seven times. Once you have to make a start! All right, it won't happen it again. That's not enough! You must go there. My God! Saint Joan of Arc. You'll go far. Honesty is the best policy. ...said grandmother, and then the wolf ate her for breakfast. Good night! To our... friendship, Mrs. District School Inspector. It was charming as always. But before I forget, Ali. There's one more thing. What did I hear recently? One of my principals bags a new teacher behind my back. - Any comments? - The rotten philanderer! - Another? - Please. You went behind my back, bypassing the Board of Education. Using your connections to the country school inspector. Yes. We were manning the barricades while you were eating curds and whey. Get to the point, Ali. - I need someone. - So do others. Admit you feel disregard. Your guerrilla tactics border on anarchy, my friend. In my district I'm responsible. What do you think we're here for? Sometimes I wonder. You had a graduate last year, it's not my fault he's gone. Is it mine? "Certainly, Comrade Principal. Of course, Comrade Principal. "As you say, Comrade Principal. I conform." He ran like clockwork. A numbscull! - An absolute ass-kisser! - Calm down, please. Oh sorry, you chose him. He was a well-qualified comrade. You could have trained him. But I didn't like him, from the start. What I always say. You don't think objectively. No Ali, you're not getting the new one. Maybe you don't like her nose, or she might have bow legs. I don't have bow legs. Who's talking about you? - What do you want anyway? - I wanted to speak to you, I'm... Registration in the school office, when it's ready. I'm Karla Blum! No! I am! - Please wait outside. - No, we're done. Sit down. So you're the new graduate. Yes, I'm here since yesterday. But I couldn't find anyone. I'm sorry, we're moving... Where on earth did you sleep? There are no hotel rooms here. In a boat house. - You have friends here? - No, I met someone. - That was fast work! - But he's not my type. I see... - And it's beside the point. - I agree. Miss Blum, you're a teacher, and bear certain moral responsibilities. Don't get me wrong. We're all human. But please keep your relationships discrete. I disagree. How can honesty do harm? You contradict your superior! Youth always thinks uncompromisingly. Gather your experiences, as we did ourselves, and healthy opposition is a good thing. - Do you have your papers? - Yes, I have. Please... - God, she's naive. - None other but her! Be happy together. You're the best. Of your kind. It's your neck, Ali. Don't come moaning to me in six month's time... So, get on with it. Excuse the phrase. Goodbye, Comrade Hirte. Goodbye, colleague Blum, all the best for the start. Goodbye, thank you! Nothing doing. I'm going home. You're just scared, right? Only couples are in there. Bye, see you tomorrow. - Looking for someone? - Yes, I am. - Then go on in. - I can't go in alone. I could take you in... if you want. - All right... just to see if he's here. - Let's go. Where did he find her? Shall we dance? You can get a better look. May I? Oh no, a waltz! - Have you been here long? - Where? - In town. - No. - Going to stay? - A few years. In the hall? In town. And in the hall? My name's Uwe Wendorf. Would you take a little walk with me? Just around the building or to the lake and back. They think I'm no good with girls. Just once around the building. Nothing else. - That was fast work. - Better shut your mouth! - What brings you here? - Me? The school. - Which one? - Fontane-Schule. Great, that's our's! We're the best school in the district. We move to a new building, the first to be built. It's thanks to our principal. He gets things done, for sure. - And how are the teachers? - Like everywhere else. They're muddling through. What they tell us is selected and edited for the youth. - Now, now... - What else? I keep my mouth shut. My mother's a teacher. Family considerations. But one guy speaks up. Let's go to the Lake? I'd rather not. I've something to say. I come to you as a teacher. So she'll come to us. The old man told us we were getting a new one. - What did you do? - Nothing. - Is that all? - But he did talk to her. What did you talk? Did you use first names? She looked so young... And then I griped. Fine! So she knows about the class. She'll do us in... maybe. Or maybe vice versa. The guy's in love! Wait a moment! There's sand in my shoe. You're an old boor. But go on and run, I don't care. - Bet you'll walk me home? - I won't. - Bet you will? - Whatever. - I'll bet you a kiss. - Ten, if it makes you happy. OK, ten from you if you bring me home, ten from me if you don't. You're crazy. That's the same either way. Not at all. Do you think your kisses are as good as mine? Right, you went to college. - Gorilla. - Cow. - Blockhead. - Underaged. - Scumbag. - Boo! Jerk. Alright... See, you brought me home after all. Are you mad? If the landlady hears us! - She's hard of hearing. - How do you know? What you looking at? Never seen anyone opening a door? Not with stolen keys. - Where are they from? - Our landlady. Our...? I'm glad it's dark. - Why? - I bet you don't look too bright right now. - I'm upstairs. - That room? - Slanted walls... - I think it's cozy. In summer an oven, in winter a fridge. A hovel. - All in the name of love, eh? - Don't get big ideas. The other rooms were no better. And it's not far from school. - Come on, my ten kisses! - Not today, I'm busy now. - Maybe tomorrow. - Tomorrow. You're never outside. You sleep all day. - Because you're up at night. - Right. Waitresses finish late. And Mrs. Schwanikow says you're working night shift. And you think, horizontally. Hurry up. Do you think money grows on trees? Hurry up! 20 more meters and we get a bonus! - How much? - 150! - Is it you? - No, my grandmother. So the cheekiness runs in the family. "Dear Kaspar, I was very wrong about you. I'm a silly fool." - No signature. - Wondering who wrote it? "A silly fool", so it's no question. - You smell of forest. - Really? So what's up? Why were you wrong? I've been following you. To the sawmill. - Following me, again? - Yes. In an hour I start teaching. But I've no idea how to begin. He's given me the 12th grade. "You'll be fine", that's easy to say. Lanky? - Will I be alright? - Sure, the way you're built. I should hope so! - Morning. - Morning. Hope you had a good rest, Schimmelpfennig. Thank you, principal, same to you. Grandma needed bandaging again? Right, and today she was particularly petulant. - Go to your class, please. - That would be where? Here's our stable, Rudi! - They're halls, not stables! - So? Is he in my class? Yes. Class spokesman, pharmacist's son, bourgeois, but intelligent. Going to the Math Olympiad. And cunning as hell, oh dear. The moment he just sees me he's itching... - Hanging by a thread. - Expulsion? Rubbish! The others want him out. Because they can't handle him. But I like a good fight. Stupid of me to even talk to him. But if it's important to you... I see. You want to save his head because we need him. - Good luck. - All the best! - Thank you. You'd better ignore him. Any questions? Let's make a start. Nervous? Fine, me too. Friendship. Quiet, please! - This is Miss Blum, Karla. - Hello. She'll be taking over German and history. And will help me as class adviser. But I'll still be your civics teacher. I hope you'll do nothing to make me or the school ashamed of you. Miss Blum is new to teaching, but she's come up here voluntarily from Berlin. So be nice to her. That's all I'll say. Sit down. Quiet please! Why are you laughing? Because it's not without charm to see something other than trousers being hiked up. What shall we do now? We can't laugh the whole time. - Maybe a song? - Great, a happy song! Frieda, where are you from? Where are you going? When are you coming back? Frieda, where are you from? Where are you going? When are you coming back? Right now I'm still here, and when I come back depends on the schedule. Monday, 1st and 2nd periods, German, with me. 3rd, art. 4th, history. 5th and 6th math. With Mr. Jott. Tuesday... 1st with Mr. Hirte. 2nd, history, 3rd, Mr. Eifert. 4th and 5th... physical education. Wednesday, 1st with Mrs. Wendorf, Russian. 2nd, geography with Mr. Karstadt. You're playing it wrong. You should lay down the queen. See? Continue dictating please. Sure. In short, from Thursday like last year. Thank you. Give her Fontane. Do you know Fontane? Fontane struggled on the left as a critical realist. And recognized the power of the working class... Good girl, Erna! - Who told you this rubbish? - Our principal. Recently. "Oh eagle land, "whose wings, spread left and right, touch western Rhine and eastern Niemen both. "Oh future land, oh hope of German soil, "whose triumph needs but will and will alone." In his youth Fontane was on the right and wrote poems in Prussian blue. - Maybe... - He hadn't read Marx yet. Once he read him, he fell into line. That's how we'd like it, wouldn't we? I think the point is not how we'd like to have it. But how it really was. Whether he read Marx or not... He never recognized the power of the working class. - So why is our school named for him? - Do you know Fontane well? And you? No more than that either. I see. Yes of course. Pardon me. We'll do Fontane only later anyway. Great, let's turn off our brains again. You don't know anything but you want to debate with me. I have a suggestion. I've already made the plan for this year. We were going to do Fontane in May, before the exams. If we lose a few days through a cold winter, we'll have to skip him. But we could start him right away. If we want to. I don't think it will be a cold winter. But if we have to study Fontane anyway, why not now? Well, that's gonna be fun. In front of her first class she labels her principal an ignoramus. I'm sorry. What should I do? It really wasn't correct. Good grief, I know Fontane was nationalistic. But they're greenhorns, Karla. It would confuse them politically. You've seen it. - Are we on first names now? - We're colleagues, aren't we? Who gets left out now when it's a cold winter? - I don't know. - You have to. Stick to the curriculum or you'll hang yourself. And then I'll hang you. Come and sit in one of my classes sometime. Any questions? Goodbye, I have to go. Don't go to sleep! Still in school? A little caution and it wouldn't have happened. But you jump from thought to speech. - We're different that way. - I'm just a little older. Do I have to tell you Uncle now? It would be a shame to say less and less over time just because one becomes so reasonable. - Schiller. - How come? Don Carlos, Marquis Posa's departure from the queen: "Tell him to remember as a man His youthful dreams. "The heart must not admit the insect prudence." So what? That's beautiful and true. I'll memorize that too. General truths are fine, in general. But haven't you noticed things don't work that way? Nothing's that clear. You're right, not everything's clear. When you learn Schiller, for example. Even Western scientists admit that the cosmonauts' successes have ushered in a new era of science. But my point is, ideology is to a certain extent the Soviet rockets' fuel. Which consists of dialectical materialism applied to science. Any questions? So space travel would be inconceivable without dialectical materialism. That's fair to say. But the Americans will reach the moon first. And only their probe reached Venus. - How do you know? - It was in the paper. "Americans will be first on the moon", that was in our newspaper? - Doesn't matter. - So where did you get this? - I heard it. - From whom? From a friend. You pledged not to listen to western broadcasts. Who else listens to western broadcasts? Not me. We don't have a radio. I don't listen to them. - I don't either. - We don't either. - We don't. - We don't either. - I don't either. - I don't either. Thank you. And you, Schimmelpfennig? What does that mean? Radio and television. Very nice. - Goodbye, see you tomorrow. - Goodbye. Goodbye! See you... Listen, bud... Try a bit more subtly next time. Why? It's true about Venus. But the Yanks still aren't first on the moon. - You're lucky he has no clue. - Why... Do you know better? Better than the principal? So what? I don't know anything about it either. Go there, explain it to him. I'm not mad. So why doesn't he come to me if he thinks he knows it better? Good question. You go and ask him. If there's anything to it, explain it to the class. Now or immediately? I know them inside out. Behind my back they produce a lot of hot air. Don't lose any sleep over that. Just get through the curriculum. That's how you can help me. I have to be able to rely on you, girl. With Janson on my back. I can't talk care of everyone. And upstairs they don't let you alone. How's Fontane going? - Nearly done. - We'll have a look then. Before there are any nasty surprises with you. - You went to college? - I studied journalism. And then I wrote about all kinds of things, already during my studies. I was a highly prized employee. Always saw the wider context. I analyzed and ascertained, solved tangled problems... Rapped knuckles. Ruthlessly, if I wanted to make a point. - Then that was it. - Why was that it? - Something came up. - What came up? Stalin's death. I quoted him, others praised him as a great sage. But when the truth came out that was it for me. Maybe I'm just sentimental. Others got over it faster. Some amazingly quickly. They adjusted easily. It wasn't so easy for me. I had read so much but didn't know everything. It dawned on me. I decided to become mistrustful and questioning. - In the sawmill? - No, it wasn't that quick. The story gets better. I decided to focus on reality. My boss encouraged me. We had to keep going! So I brandished my pen and wrote. He tore the article from my hand with glee. After the first page his brow began to furrow. He smiled awkwardly and made witty threats. After the third page he was seized with excitement. Like one who reads forbidden things. But quite correct... He used to be a friend of mine, since high school. When did he want to publish? He patted me on the shoulder and said I'd gone a little too far. He didn't know if now was the right time. Start with success stories, later then for sure. Later a government decree appeared. My friend asked if I still had the article. Because what I'd written exemplified the decree perfectly. I threw the article away. Similar articles appeared. But not by me. I went back to journalism's basics. To the wood the paper's made from. I'm still working in my trade. You're not saying anything. You've got to get up. I see, you're trying to agitate me! Rubbish. The water's boiling. And I thought you could help me. ...3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, divided by 2? Makes 4½ tails each. - You can eat them. - How dare you reject them? They're disgusting. But Karlie! Honestly caught crayfish, cooked in honest pots, must wet your appetite! Because you don't steal eels anymore you think you're honest? That's the great thing about my job. I never have a chance to be dishonest. But this job is a fraud. You shirk your real job. I'm not at school anymore. I don't need your extra lessons in morals. Your bleating on and on gets on my nerves! Enjoy your meal! In this way Fontane changed from conservative to radical democrat. He talks of the triumph of the new, albeit after a terrible battle. And he sees the working class as its guarantor. Those are just unpublished letters. - No workers in his books. - Correct, they were outside his experience. He was his own man. What he didn't know about he didn't write about. But what he knew, he wrote the truth about it. I don't know... You have to read pretty carefully. Those concerned understood him and made him enough trouble. But it's true, he preferred a subtle form of expression. That was his way. It was the best he could do. In a dictatorship. Now I know why our name's Fontane-Schule. You don't know a thing. Assuming one really has one's own opinion, and isn't parroting, then it's reprehensible today to withhold the truth. Anything less is cowardice or hypocrisy. Or what did you think? Then I should get up now and add something to what the director said about Kläuschen's question about the moon landing? Yes, I suppose you should. When the Americans launched their Venus rocket, its goal was here. The trajectory was a straight line, except for the curvature of space. Relatively easy. When the Russians launched their Mars probe... ...the Mars was here, in opposition to the sun. The rocket first had to travel around the sun. But it still didn't have it, because Mars also moves at a speed of v = 24. But I leave that for now. It had to catch up with it first. Which is what happened. But it's path was three times as long as the Venus probe. In the meantime the Americans had also been busy. Break a leg! What did you learn in 4 years? How could you allow him to make a fool of me? It was about the truth. You didn't do it. You came again with those pledges. Well, suppose it was a mistake. And now? - You and your authority. - Nonsense, it's about yours. They're running circles around you. Can't you see? You're the teacher. They should learn from you, not you from them. I don't want them cramming, they should learn to think. That's my aim, and to win their trust. It's called democracy. I'll gladly forgo my authority for that. Fine, go ahead. But first you have to earn your authority before forgoing it. Right now you're just jumping on their bandwagon. Challenging the principal. Of course they're in on it. But fine ideals. Never heard such things. Truth, Thought, Democracy. Everyone learning together in brotherly love and trust. Marvelous. We're all just people, us and them. Except me, I'm a monster. I'm an ancient communist stuck in the class struggle. Or an opportunist, betraying his ideals. Standing in the way of the youth. Keep to the point. You ducked out. Wait a minute. I have my ideals, all right. But they're based in reality. Which in school means a front between students and teachers. If you ignore that you won't get far. That's all I'll say. Come over this evening. - For a little chat. - I have to work. You can. A parental visit. - To tell me about Uwe's work. - Nothing to tell. I'm not worried about him. But I am. He was too impressed by your German class today. He said it was historical. - Can't that be avoided? - Hardly. Rudi was right. You're a little too impulsive. I know, I was just like you. Know how they launch a manned spacecraft? They count from 10 to 0. Only then do they press the button. Here we are, are you coming in? No, please. You've said what you wanted to say. There's someone at home I've been arguing with. I'd like to put it right this evening. Your first fight. Don't give in, or it will become a habit. All right. Hi, Karlie. What's up? Ah yes, we're fighting. How could I forget... What about? Crayfish... and big words. Fighting over crayfish... - Forget it, Karlie. - And the big words? - Still boring. - Sure they are. With no deeds. You know, I really asserted myself today. Congratulations... Have you ever done that? Depends on what you mean. When you're right. And stand by it. - Great feeling, huh? - Yes. It was a fait accompli. - You took him for a ride? - No. - I couldn't avoid it. - And he? Oh, Kaspar. What kind of people are we? Karlie, give it up. You'll never be aggressive enough. You're almost shedding tears for him already. Perhaps it isn't the way to do things. You have to be able to deal with the reactions. You'd rather convince him? It won't work, with his leverage. I have to prove him right. Fine. But let's make up, all right? For the trip, you coming? Sailing? On sunny paths delaying, two smiling girls did spree. They swung their skirts so daring and sung a song carefree. One, two, three! The first wore a bun, the second wore a braid, the third had a bird on her head. Tirallala... I now know what bothers me about you. - What? - That you're not wearing a daringly swung skirt. - Don't wear slacks to school. - Why not? Your superiors might worry that your class would start thinking. Can't have that, can we? - Thinking what? - No idea. - Trousers are boring. - Why? They don't inspire thoughts. Fine, you want to think. Who's stopping you? Here's a penny, buy yourself a paper and look inside. It says thinking is our duty. That's why it's no fun anymore. - I can't talk to you. - Too serious. Who started fighting? Karlie, I'm on your side. Maybe you're right. Maybe you're cleverer than me. But just for you. No one else benefits. Come on, now. What are you actually for? We have to live for something. Such as... the blue sky. They want to kill you, but you say the sky is blue. Fine, the sky is blue, so come on. - Well, friendship. - Good evening. You live on Seestraße, this way's better for you. It's much closer. Really? - I'll find my own way. - He's neglecting you. - Night shift. - Were the dear parents good? - Didn't you tell your father to come? - Maybe. Did Ali go for me again? You're still too young to understand. Mr. Hirte thinks a lot of you. He lets fools think. I got a thing for him, too. - Shall I show you what I think? - What? What I think of him is very graphic. Come with me. - Must it be right now? - No. Go around to the shop door and ring. Do you know this man? - Where's this from? - The Free German Youth club cellar. The Russians used it after... ...the Nazis. - How long have you had this? - A few days. We were after a spinet. But that was just a rumor. But I found this instead. Interesting, eh? So what, Rudi? He could have been misguided then. Many were and went along with it. Wonderful, the boss and misguided! Could it be? Can it be? But we... We can't make mistakes. That's not permitted. Let's see how he explains that. I'll have to speak with him. - For sure? - Yes. - Was anyone else there? - Yes, but no one else knows. Good night. Busy? I'm on early shift now. That's nice. Let's be nice to one another again. I'm not angry with you. Karlie... what's wrong? I'm worried. Can I help? No, you can't. Something happened? Even if, you'd be the last person I'd talk to about it. What's up with you? I whistled. - Oh, it was you. - Still upset? You've be avoiding me recently, or you run away. - No, I haven't. - All right. You look terrible. Are you worried about something? Not expecting, are you? - No... - That's all we needed. - You were born here, right? - Yes. And what did you do then? Orphanage school and apprenticeship, then I left. I lead a gang. Leather jacket. Beard. Down with the state! Long live anarchy! Free will, free people, free love. You don't believe me, do you? It was a long time ago. I don't think I look like that anymore. What happened to the SA? Wasn't it abolished in '33? Oh, you're not prepared for class! End of the Weimar Republic and the so-called Nazi takeover of power. That's why you're asking. First thing in the morning. Don't think you're free after school! You have to prepare your lessons! One day I'll come and check! Come with me. Let me show you something. What about him? I can't right now. I didn't have an opportunity yet. No opportunity, I see. Fine. ...Schilling is there with us. You know, the one who hit the chemist... - Morning. - Morning. ...anyway, the door opens and a boy comes in to ask a question. And Schilling tells Bracht to take his hands out of his pockets... There's a swastika in 12 B! It was so quiet in there, I went in and then I saw it. Where? In your class, on the desk. - We must call. - Not yet. Let's take a look. Afraid? How dare they! What's all this? We wanted to see if you could still salute so well. I don't understand. That's me. You mean the uniform? That's '48, amateur dramatics. Brecht, Fear and Misery of the Third Reich. I had to do it, on Party orders. The SA man, of all people. That's why I look so evil. It was a great success. I had to play it again and again. Picture the scene: the kitchen of a fine house, Berlin '33, in the kitchen the maid, my bride. He's emptied their joint account. "I have expenses. The boots cost more than 20 marks." She says: "But they were issued." "That's what we thought. So I took the better ones, with spats. "And got stuck with the bill." "27 marks just for boots? And the other expenses?" she says. "Can't remember. And what's the interrogation? "Calm down. I won't deceive you." Now she's crying: "What am I to make of that? We must have 20 marks left." "Who says there's nothing left? "That's impossible. You can rely on me. "What you trust me with is locked away like in a safe. "Do you trust old Theo again?" She says nothing, just cries. "You're a little overworked, that's all. "I'll be off to my exercises. "Right then, Heil Hitler!" I still know my lines. Practice makes perfect. Well. Any questions? - It's still no proof. - Get lost. Wipe that off. Yes. Hirte. Of course. All right... Yes... bye. Janson. I think Eifert told her. She's coming to investigate. Please inform the staff. Faculty meeting at 10. Classes are cancelled. 12 stays here. And send Schimmelpfennig to me. - Sorry, Alfred, I... - You know better, as usual. This only concerns me, the class and Schimmelpfennig. - You stay right out of it, please. - I can't stay out of it, Alfred. I'm in it. I've known about the photo for two weeks. I didn't believe it. But I didn't come to you because... ...because I did believe it. Have you ever seen an SA uniform? That's an officer's cap. But the collar patch denotes someone from the ranks. We didn't have anything else for the play. Didn't you notice? But you've never seen a real SA uniform. This is no use, Alfred. Faculty meeting at 10. Can't anyone stop this infernal ringing? I think we can close the meeting. We have analyzed Miss Blum's professional conduct. We've ascertained her inability to exemplify a firm educational standpoint, and we've seen her indecisive relationship to the principal, Mr. Hirte. This has permeated her work here, creating the knotty problem we face, this objectionable graffity. A knot we should severe. Young Alexander. But we're not dealing here with the proverbial Gordian knot. I would suggest Miss Blum give some consideration to whether her further presence here is feasible. That's what I meant. There are villages nearby that are crying out for staff. This is ridiculous. As I said, it's a suggestion. Colleague Hirte, your opinion? She stays. You have considered this carefully? I'd like to know how you intend to continue working with her. At least you'll give her a lower grade. She keeps the class. And deals with the problem. And you guarantee it'll be all right? How long are you going to lie there? At least eat something. Want some tea? Come on, Karla, I understand. Of course the swastika was a political provocation. A highly political one, but not fascist. You could even say the boy was vigilant. Though that wasn't his intention. But you know. You know what he wanted. Don't let them make a fool of you. You've already confessed. They threaten you and you already renounce. I just want you to see that you're in the right. So get up. What are you telling me? I know all that. I know I want what's right. Well, you see. Have a break, you've earned it. Winter's coming, the animals of the forest are settling in, the squirrels are checking their supplies, the badger rolls up in its cave to hibernate... I think there's only one thing, Lanky... I must avoid such mistakes. I have to look more closely. And be more careful. I can't charge against walls. Better wipe your feet! Or the school dragon will get you. Ah, you have one of those. - Is the principal in? - Sure! What's he like? I want a job as a janitor. Morning! Morning! Heard you were looking for a janitor. Wrong office. I'm just the cleaner. Your rag chucked you out, huh? I do need a janitor. Advertise in the socialist press. - What's the pay? - 1.70 and a warm apartment. - Not a bad start, and a pension too. - Cheers! We're doing a new series. A survey of today's youth on people they take as their examples. - You've done this before. - It's always good. And you want to do your survey here? There was a cutey in the hall. - Your youngest resource? - My youngest weakness. She says you have an open ear. All right. Karla. This is Miss Blum. Mr. Hartmann, from the press. He has some questions for the students. You don't blame me for the janitor? Sorry, have to be crafty at the press. It's okay. But during class? Just this once. He won't be long. Best go to my class. Hello. Colleague Jott, this is Mr. Hartmann from the district press. He has some questions. With the principal's permission. Go ahead. We're planning something very interesting and important, dear friends. We're going into schools and similar kinds of institutions where young people are trained and we're asking who your role models are and why. The answers are evaluated and the most interesting replies will then be published. Please take over, Miss Blum. It's more in your line. If you like. Go ahead. My role model is Friedrich Gauss. Because at 14 he invented the formula of arithmetic progression. Which you at 17 are far from understanding. Dorothea Erxleben can inspire us all. She was a progressive woman and the first female German doctor. She investigated the causes preventing women from studying. I admire the brave Soviet cosmonauts. I'd like to be a cosmonaut. When I grow up. Quiet! You're not 14 anymore. Answer our guest's questions seriously. At least for courtesy. Wendorf, Uwe; Kleinschmidt, Erna... Schimmelpfennig, what about you? Don't you have a role model? What for? Go ahead. I want to be like Dolores Ibarruri. She's passionately committed to the cause of the Spanish working class. So Monika wants to be Germany's first female doctor, and Erna wants to fight for the Spanish workers. Of course we mean people's attitudes, not their deeds. The urge to imitate adults ends in nursery school. You probably wouldn't be able to fight passionately for anything. The question is whether it isn't more sensible to use one's mind. And more difficult. That's worth discussing. Yes, that's really a question. I won't discuss La Passionaria's mind with you, my boy. Not with you! Schimmelpfennig, one fine day... One fine day you'll hang yourself. I warn you. Your mathematical talent doesn't give you the right to philosophize. Forget about Mr. Jott. I'm surprised at your young colleague. - When Schimmelpfennig started talking, you should have intervened. - Alright. Uwe Wendorf, Jutta Rothe, Renate Köhn, Rose Engel and Gerhard Wilgeroth. Bring them here. Why? Leave me out. They're more sensible one to one. Members of a pack need to impress one another. What do you think you'll accomplish? Of course they'll tell you the names you want to hear. I just don't get it. Everywhere else we get sensible answers, why not here. Don't you think the boys have any role models? Yes, probably. More than we think. One for talking, one for singing, and maybe one for smiling. - And for "small stuff" like fighting? - I don't know. - What about learning? - Too vague. What subject? - Let's say math. - Algebra or geometry? - Geometry. - Euclidean? - Non-Euclidean. In that case they might say Rudi Schimmelpfennig. There he's even better than Jott. Dolores Ibarruri and Rudi Schimmelpfennig? Great. Maybe the question is wrong. Maybe at that age they no longer have personified ideals. My opinion: A good example never did anyone any harm. Yes. Sure. - So fetch them. - No, I'd rather not. Look at that. Joan of Arc herself. She won't do it. She hears voices, and usually from the wrong side. But she has her principles. She blows her trumpet. Good grief, Karla, be reasonable! You know it's about time. That's all I say. Please obey my instructions. - Will five be enough? - Will she do it? Excuse me. Uwe Wendorf, Rose Engel, Jutta Rothe, Renate Köhn, Gerhard Willgeroth... ...to the principal please. Half a year later It's my pleasure to also mention our colleague, Miss Blum. Her start here was admittedly not one of the best. She made a false start. So her award today is an achievement. From a certain dead point onwards, to continue the athletic metaphor, which everyone has to overcome once in life, she got her second wind and took us all over the high hurdles. She was increasingly able to work within the faculty collective and to find the correct approach to her students. Her classes were marked by good discipline, and she kept herself ahead of the plan, with time for revision, so we have no worries about her students' examination scores. What more can I say? She's all right, and here's a little something for her. I'm glad for you, Miss Blum. Well... Forget the speech. We know it wasn't easy. That's all. - Sit down properly. - Leave it. - You know what? - No. I'm a corpse. I'm a pretty corpse. I'm even a decorated corpse! Decorated for services on the educational front. Of course. Nice, lying there. You don't need to see, or hear, or say anything. And you get paid for it. A little something. What did I die of? - Let's go. - Tell me, what did I die of? Shut your mouth. I'm your principal. He doesn't know. If he doesn't know something he pulls rank. Either you're drunk, or you're pretending. Watch out... self-diagnosis. I'll tell you what I died from. Of being careful, you understand? Of being careful. Some people are so careful they don't dare to go out. They might slip and break their neck. I died of being careful, understand? The dead don't blabber. You're just drunk, let's go. I'm not drunk, not one bit. Listen. Cause I'm just seemingly dead. Just to a certain point, which I'd like to call the dead one, which one must not miss in one's coffin, but shush...! Mrs. Janson might hear! You have to watch over my coffin, don't you? Slander! Vicious slander. - The bill, please. - You paid two hours ago, sir. - No favors, please. - Right, no favors. I have a little something left, so I'm paying. Keep the change. She's had enough. And you too, colleague. I'm counting on your discretion, okay bud? I'm as quiet as a corpse. Not gone yet? Taxi! I want to go home. Because there's someone else I have to tell what's what. Is that enough? If you live here it's three times too much. Three times, then. I mean it! And go a long way round. And please open the window. You will all take me seriously! Hello! Open up! It's me! You tramp. Stubborn sod! Sawfish! - What am I? - And you're a lot more! Exhale, madam. Drunk as a skunk. Stop it, I don't want to. I don't want that. Is it my birthday? Your 50th. I wanted to gratulate you, but now it's over. You still can. I won an award. Pretty flowers. And I always wanted a bag like that. But put the wine away. I got a bonus too. But I spent it. I understand. One for the road, huh? - Usually you're a good girl. - You don't understand a thing. If only you were all villains, scoundrels and rogues. - Everything would be easier. - Sure. You too, especially you! - Don't treat me like a child. - I don't. You're a grown lady who can handle a few drinks. Take me seriously, Lanky. How seriously? Dead seriously. - What happened? - I won an award. - I know. - Know what for? I should imagine they're satisfied with you. Yes. They're satisfied with me. They're all satisfied with me. Is there anything worse? One thing's worse. The class is also happy with me. At least, most of them are. I've made it easy for them. And the worst of it is, I was happy with myself. Everything was fine. Everyone praised me and patted me on the shoulder. Excuses, all excuses. It starts here, with me. It started when I didn't want to make any more mistakes. Simple as that. It isn't possible. Just try it. Didn't you know that? It's old hat. Something's gotta happen, Lanky. With a bang. They must see that Karla Blum is back again. No matter what happens. I don't give a damn. - Right, now you. - Stop it, I get it. - Time for serious conversations. - Yes. Discussions ever evening. Fights every second day. And how! I want to fight with you again. - You'll have no peace from me. - In other words... ...the film starts again from reel one. In the middle of classes, unannounced? I only heard it myself this morning. Don't worry, it'll be fine. This way! Peters... ...a 4. Richter... 4. Here's the 12th. Over there are three 11th grades. - It's up to you. - The 12th, we're late. Hardly worth it, they're being taught by a young assistant teacher. - That' what we're interested in. - She's just returning essays. All the better, then we won't be in the way. Hello! - A delegation from Berlin, a Youth Commission. - No formalities, please. - Lenke. - Blum. Don't let us disturb you. We won't stay long. Good afternoon, Miss Blum. I'm returning the final assignments. The last one before the exams. - On what subject? - "What the School Has Given Me". Düsterhöft... a 4. Happens in the best families. Kleinschmidt, a 4. Wallrabe... 4. What? Uwe Wendorf... 4. This is the grand finale...? Rudi Schimmelpfennig... ...a 5. For once you didn't write as dry as usual. You even covered the subject matter. But I believe you least of all. There you are. I don't understand. I first had a 2. You changed the 2 into a 4. But the mistakes are the same. That's not fair! She's right! Miss Blum, I think we all deserve an explanation. I can imagine what Schimmelpfennig's opinion about the school was. But was everyone off the subject? No one was off the subject, quite the opposite. Rudi, please give me your assignment. "...always taught me sincerity." He means the school here. "My German and history teacher demanded this virtue, "and was always a good example. "The school gave me a truly steadfast world view. "The principal was most supportive. "He explained my ideological unclarity and always had an answer for me. "He answered ceaselessly, even after all my uncertainties were eliminated." Well, I'll be... - Yes, Erna? - Rudi doesn't mean it. He's just saying that. I know, Erna. It is difficult. You say your peasant grandparents couldn't afford to send your mom to school. Some say they learned the right view of history. Others mention the great socialist ideals. That's all well and good. I know I'd do some of you an injustice with a 4. So these grades won't count. There can be no grades for personal sincerity. You should have told us. We had no way of knowing... No, you had no way of knowing. But apart from a few, such as Erna, who is innocently uncritical of her school, you write with the intention "The more I praise the teachers the more they praise me." Remains Rudi Schimmelpfennig. He got a 5 because he sees best what's wrong and still gives praise. Not counting irony. Which can't help, in the end. Those who wrote like that are hypocrites. And Rudi's the worst. Excellent. It's not that simple with the hypocrisy. I believe we really came at an inopportune moment. We find it very interesting. And what's your opinion? We do what's required of us. Now come off it! You're not suggesting your teacher required hypocrisy from you? Not directly. I just can't always explain it the right way. What do you mean, not directly? I should answer that. These assignments are the result of my own conduct. I tried at first to encourage your enthusiasm and your own opinions, and then I took it from you again. Enthusiasm first, by avoiding difficult problems, then courage, by rewarding parroting, and in the end the need for an own opinion, by cramming you with material. Yes, it's my fault. Four weeks before the exams you sit there like stuffed chickens, you just can't fly. Well? Nothing to say to that? Or is it because we're here? I assume our guests will have noticed a certain omission in Miss Blum's words. She said she wanted at first to help us form an own opinion. But then she stopped. On her own? Just like that? Who stopped her? Who made her change her stance? Who does a teacher depend on? That's all I'll say. Here we go again. If you mean the principal, say so. I would go even further. At least to the school inspector. No, Rudi. That's no excuse. We must start again from where we left off. That's all I meant. Is that all? - Any questions? - Not at the moment. You'll continue the discussion. But a few words from me: One thing is clear. We must voice the facts to change them. Our world view should improve the status quo, not defend it. That's a bit general. But you know what I mean. A word to some of you in the class: Courage is cheap, reason dear. Think about it. - Friendship! - Friendship. - Goodbye, and good look. - Thank you. That's all for today, you can go home. - I love flying visits. - You've no reason to complain! You came out squeaky clean. With me as the dogmatist. Well done! - Goodbye! - Goodbye. - I'll throw her out. - All of a sudden? - She took me for a ride. - I have that feeling too. And you gave her an award. She's out, you can count on it. That was the last time I counted on you. I want a written statement by tomorrow. - Hello, Mrs. Schwanikow. - Going past the drug store? - Maybe. - Could you get me some sleeping pills? - I'll do. - Since my husband's death... Keep out! - Damn! - Sorry. Something came up suddenly. - The paper's ruined. - I thought of something. And some higher-ups were there. It could not be stopped. And Rudi was his old self. The experts were right behind me. Hey, let's go dancing again. At the lake? See if your waitress's still there. I need the sink. What's the matter with you today? Has prosperity broken out? Each according to his needs? Another bonus? You people have it made. No, just felt like it. Happens sometimes. Oh, you had another great success today, if I heard you right. Should I ask in our nursery if they need anyone? For all those kids. But Lanky, I'm still alive. No one tore my head off. All in one piece. See for yourself. I should be happy for you. Do you have to work? Yes, and it's better that way. I'd just ruin your mood. See you. - Good Evening. - Good Evening. - Sleeping pills please. - Can't you sleep? - Have a dance, that'll help. - Not for me, for my landlady. Please come. - What's the celebration? - Nothing. They wanted to dance again. My parents were out so I couldn't say no. - Say at least good evening. - Good evening. Just for five minutes. Look out! - Good Evening. - Good Evening. Turn up the juice. What are you dancing? Discotheque, never heard of it? You've a lot to catch up on. Weird. Never heard of. We'll show you, it's easy. Shall we? You promised to dance with me. Hully Gully! Let's go! Let's go! Oh, Hully Gully! Oh, Hully Gully! Oh, Hully Gully! Let's go! - Good night. - Good night. Good night. Bye! - Good night. - I'll drive you home. - Can you drive? - Sure. Anyone want a lift? Come with me Sis, I'm responsible for you. Leave the door open. I have to talk with Rudi. Just don't you bring a brat home. I tell you, girl! Well, thank you. Why not do something crazy, stupid or silly? Ever been to the sea? I mean, since you've been here. No. Is he waiting for you? Mrs. Schwanikow's sleeping pills. She sends you because she hasn't got the guts. She's hoarding them. How far is it? About an hour. All right, drive. Before I change my mind. There it is, the sea. La mere, the sea, morie, il mare, thalatta. - Which do you like the best? - Stop showing off. I like the sea itself best. Not so far, I still have classes with you today. - I don't want to be late. - Coward! Hey! - Rudi, you're mad. - You had a fair warning. Gerda, see if you still can catch Karla Blum. - I want to see her immediately. - A visitor, Janson. Tell her to wait till she's gone. What do you want? I was expecting a reasonable report on yesterday's visit. - You can't get it off your mind? - Frankly, no. If that's your report, I've seen it. - As I said, I was curious. - Well then. You're quite seriously telling the school board that all this was on her part just "being emotional"? "...educationally irresponsible but well meant." So you haven't given up hope trying to convince her some day that she's on the wrong track, with better arguments, or whatever. - Yesterday you sounded different. - Cost me a night's sleep. I'm sorry. And you think you can deal with her? - That's my business. - And what if she gets you? Be careful, Ali. One can find a dozen reasons to retire you early. Resting on your laurels would be putting it kindly. Blind to new trends, dead wood, suppression of criticism... Please. I'll resign right away. You'd like that... She'll come round. You can rely on it. Stop it. Since she's here you haven't been in control. It's schizophrenic. Colleague Schneider! Is she here? Send her in. - I thought... - Now. "Dear Rudi, why didn't you tell me you're in love with Miss Blum? "I would have understood. "I wanted to tell you yesterday after you drove her home, "but you didn't come back. Yours, Barbara." What do you say to that? You know, Alfred... Yesterday the class asked me up to their party at Rudi's. Later he wanted to drive me home. And he asked me if I'd been to the sea. And I hadn't. - And so off we went. - So... that's enough. What do you think you were doing? What if that came out? In class, at school, with the parents! Can you imagine the rumors that would get about? We can't overstep the bounds between teachers and students. Not even you! Especially not again and again. Do you understand? If you don't see it this time, then I don't know. What do you intend to do now? I'll tell you. See reason at last, all right? That's all I'll say. Show me, please. Sit down. I think I made a bad mistake. Which can't be corrected. - I agree with you. - Good, and about time. But you won't avoid a severe reprimand. Don't think otherwise. It'll go into your file. I agree with you. But it doesn't affect my work goals. On the real issue. That's separate. Good grief! You were wrong from the start. Take a look back. I don't agree. I thought you were more reasonable. Too bad. It looks bad. For you. You don't seriously think she and the boy... My opinion's irrelevant. But as you said, rumors get out, and we can't ignore that. And now you want to simply... That's no reason at all. Your long experience should tell you that it is, Ali. That's impossible. I won't accept it. The exams are coming up. The class will be handicapped. - She should have thought of that sooner. - Over my dead body. There's no proof that they were at the sea. I'll talk to Barbara and the lad. And no one saw the letter. Excuse me, but I saw it. Do you realize what you're asking? We can try one thing. After all, miss Blum has in principle shown considerable verve in the school. She's still young and everybody makes a mistake. Why shouldn't she realize her ideals elsewhere? I propose a transfer. The further away, the better for you. You're suspended from duty until further notice. Everything else will be sent to you in writing, colleague Blum. Chin up. This youthful folly won't go on record. It's not quite correct, but at least you can start fresh. Yes. Thank you. Karla! Karla Blum! - Oh, the boss himself. - I'd like to see Miss Blum. Further up, under the roof. What's up, boss? I wouldn't go up there. She doesn't want to see anyone. Really bad mood. All over. Sit down. God grief, Karla, how could you do this? A schoolboy. You'll never live it down. Sure. But that wasn't the reason. It was convenient for her. Don't cry! Of course it was convenient for her. It's all the same to her. And she won't kick you out, she has a heart. She's just transferring you. That's enough to get rid of an unorthodox thinker. But I tell you, I'll get her. I know her weak points. We have to start with ourselves. Why trip each other up all the time. - What's the point? - Spare me. I know, you want me to change. But you can forget it. I'm sick. I'm giving up. In a year or two, I'll retire anyway. - To play with your grandchildren. - That would be nice. - I apologize. - It's all right. It's up to you young people now. And the class? What's to become of them? - Rudi's waiting for you. - Oh yes, Rudi. What happened? Now you can tell me. He chauffeured me to the sea. And gave me a kiss. Rudi, the scoundrel. Alfred, do you know where I'm going? No idea. But whatever you do, don't change. I'm telling you, Ali Hirte. You know what's right and wrong. You're not stupid. That's all I say. - I'm still your principal! - Exactly. - Coffee? - Yes, but not so strong. I can't take it. You can take a great deal. I'll show him the door if you want, Karla. I'll find my own way out, thanks. Take care, you two. What happened? - I've been transferred. - Wow. Hardly here and she's sent up the river. It still happens fast. When are you starting with us? I don't know when, or where. But I'm a teacher. Lanky, I'm going tomorrow. Further north. I looked it up on the map. Hand me the fender, would you? That sausage. Thanks. There's the sea and a bay. Great for sailing and swimming. The paddle. No, that's a grappling hook. There. There's a forest. And surely also a sawmill. - Get the airbed out of the shed. - No. No? Say something! Come on, get in. Before the wind changes. You just run away. You coward! You miserable wretch! How did I get myself taken in by you? Sink your boat and drown! Go on, drown! Let me take that. Thanks. Why aren't you in school? - Don't you have classes? - Only math and stuff. What about him, does he have to work? I'll manage now, thanks. Don't come unto the platform, because... - Bye, then. - Bye, then. Go and be a great mathematician. Or something like that. - Something big. - What about you? And continue telling them what's what, if you can. Even though in my subjects... All aboard and close the doors! Kaspar, here!
