[bird chirping] Madam pussycat, how are you today? - Where are you going? - [dramatic music playing] - [chuckles softly] - [Madam purring] [exhales] Let's have a chat. Hey. [Madam purring] [sighs] So cute! [dramatic music intensifies] Ha! [laughing] [camera clicks] [camera clicks] [dramatic music continues] [grunting, moaning] [sighing] [sighing] [birds squawking] CALL ME CHIHIRO [music fades] [woman] Okay. One salmon bento and one chicken. Thank you very much. [birds chirping in the background] [woman] Okay. - And there. Thanks. - [female customers] Thank you. [male customer 1] Chihiro, where's my garlic stir-fry? - [Chihiro chuckling] - [male customer 1 chuckling] - And here it is. - Oh, thank you. - Once again, liver and garlic... - [male customer 1] Huh? ...for stamina, no? Oh, well. How else will I satisfy you tonight? - [both chuckling] - [money clinking in cash register] A dirty old man like you should have a short life. So, extra soy sauce today! Oh, so harsh. [chuckling] - See you. - See you next time. [female chef] You handle male customers well, as we'd expect from a former sex worker. - Thank you so much. - It's not a compliment. [Chihiro] Here's your fried chicken. Thank you for coming back. - Hang on, Nagai. Who... - [Nagai] Hmm? Who told you that? One salmon, three chicken next. [Nagai] Coming up. She told me herself, right? Hmm? About what? Why did you tell her, Chihiro? I went through the trouble of keeping it a secret. You're so kind. Thank you very much. You shouldn't be so understanding. Once Nagai knows, everybody knows. Mmm... don't worry about such things. - Most of them know already. - [elderly man] What? Right? [men] Right! [male teacher] So, αβ equals c over a. The quadratic equation form, ax squared plus bx plus c. We first take out the common factor a. a(x squared plus bx/a plus c/a). Substituting this here, then we get... a{x squared-(α+β)x+αβ}. Like this. Then... [boy 1] Ew! So dirty! [boy 2] Hey, old man, you listening? [laughs] - [boy 1] This guy stinks. - [boy 2] Ugh! - [coughing] - Old man? - This is our playing spot. - Do you hear us? Hey! - [boy 3] Are you leaving? - Hey, don't ignore me, stinky. [boy 3] Hey! [Chihiro] Hi! - Hmm? - Huh? Well, you look like you're having fun. May I play too? Huh? Oh, crap. Wait. Wait for me. [wind whooshing] Old man, are you from around here? [birds squawking] Where do you come from? Hello? Would you share this bento with me? Noko Noko bento tastes somehow different from other shops. Nagai, the old lady who works there, has such a bad attitude, and so, sometimes I think, "Just die, would you?" You know? But her pickled plums are so delicious. You know, the really sour and salty ones? They're so... salty and sour. They make everything else taste so much better, don't they? [wind whooshing] Do you think that I'm boring? You don't eat pickled plums? Ah, what a pity! Okay, if you insist. [whimpering] [squealing] [chuckles softly, sniffles] Old man, would you like to take a bath? [humming] [continues humming] Is beer okay with you? - [suitcase rattling] - Huh? What? You're going? [bird squawking outside] My shirt looks good on you. [suitcase rattling] Bye, then! - [girl 1] Oh my God! You got this? - [girl 2] Yeah. Why? [girl 1] Wow! Isn't it from the latest series? - You know, those graphics are amazing! - [chuckling] I know, right? - They're amazing. - Look! I bought one too. - What? Oh my God. Let me see! Let me see! - [laughing] [girl 1] Oh, wow! It looks so great. His smile is so good. Usually, he's so serious. - Hey! The theme from the last series. - Ah... [chuckling] - [girl 1] Oh, that song is divine. - Oh God, is anime all we can sing? - Where did you buy this? Online? - [girl 2] Yeah. - [girl 3 chuckles] - I'm so jealous! Ugh! - I should get one. - [girl 2] Go on. - Really? I think I might. - [phone buzzing] - Looks great. - Yeah. [girl 1] He looks so amazing in the latest season. - [girl 2] So good... - [girl 1] I can't decide. YOUR DAD'S COMING HOME EARLY. Who's that? Your parents? Huh? Uh... My mother. [girl 2] I mean, your family gets along so well! - Mmm. And her father's so cool. - [girl 1] I know. - [girl 2] Mm-hmm. - He came in for Parents' Day. He's so tall. [girl 2] And you still go out as a family, right? - We do. - [girls] Oh! - [girl 2] That's awesome. - That's nice. So Izesura, wanna go out? - [girl 3] Hmm? - [girl 2] Huh? - [girl 3] Hmm? - [girl 2] Hmm? - Oh... - Oh, is this how the battle begins? - [girls laughing] - Are we fighting? Should we fight? So... Kuniko. Before, you said you'd like to try pottery? I found somewhere. In the summer break, I'll take you. Thank you. [mom] That's nice, isn't it, Kuniko? [Kuniko] Mmm. A friend of a colleague... He runs a pottery school. So I asked... [mom] Oh, I'm sorry. I'll bring it now. [calm music playing] [boy 1] Hey, can you do this? [boy 2] Can you do it? Sure can. Watch this. [grunts] - [boy 2] You did it! - [Chihiro] Told you so. [calm music continues] - [boy 2] Fall, fall, fall, fall, fall! - [Chihiro laughing] - [camera clicks] - [boy 2] Fall, fall! - Fall, fall, fall, fall, fall! - [camera clicks] - [music stops] - [male student] Hey, that's Chihiro. Do you know her? - She's famous. - [male students 2 and 3] Yeah. She's the one who works at the bento shop, isn't she? I heard she used to work in a massage parlor. - Yeah. - [Kuniko] Huh? [male student 3] Can you eat fried chicken sold by a hooker? Not me. [male student 2] Hey? Why not? - I think it's sexy. - [male student 3 chuckling] Sexy? [male student 2 chuckling] Think about it. Fried chicken made by a hooker. - Finger-lickin' good. - [male students laughing] HOMEMADE TASTE NOKO NOKO BENTO [birds squawking and chirping] Chicken... uh... bento, please. One? Uh, yes. One. Huh? No photographs? Uh... excuse me. No, no. Honestly, uh... Whoa! - What the... - [man chuckles] [chuckles] Who was she? - Don't know. One of my fans? - [men] Ooh. Ah, so you're also popular with the girls. [chuckles] [Chihiro] Are you guys finished for the day? Yeah. We're going for a drink. You wanna come? I can't. - I have a date. Sorry. - Ah! You've got a boyfriend? It's a secret. But another time. Hey? Don't be kidding. - We'll ask again. - [all laughing] We're going. See you. - [Chihiro] See you. - [man 2] See you. Come on. [man 3] She might actually come with us! [men laugh] Hi, what can I get you? The usual salmon? Yes. Salmon, please. Okay. One salmon bento. [Nagai] Coming up. [somber music playing] [Chihiro] I'm impressed you found such a good place. [phone buzzing] Mmm... KEISUKE WHERE ARE YOU? GIMME A CALL OR TEXT. [squealing and chuckling] [laughing] [birds chirping] - [Chihiro] Ah... smells good! - [Nagai chuckling] This bamboo is harvested fresh. Bamboo shoots remind me of Tae. She always loved doing this. [chuckles] She sure did. How's she doing? Well, she can't see anything anymore. She can only sense light. Oh. [Chihiro breathes deeply] [sizzling] [sizzling continues] [smooth jazz music playing] Hello, old man? Here's today's lunch. [smooth jazz music continues] [birds chirping] Huh? Hello? Hello? [smooth jazz music continues] Old man! Old man! [music fades] Hmm... did you move on already? [bird chirping in the distance] Mmm. [chuckles] Oh my, these are good. Mmm! Mmm! [birds squawking in the distance] THE PHARAOH'S TOMB TOKIMEKI TONIGHT THE LEGEND OF IZARON TERROR NEWSPAPER TSURUBARA TSURUBARA TOWARD THE TERRA Keith Anyan still looks handsome. Sorry for being here uninvited. Are these yours? Terra? Do you like it? [Chihiro] Mmm. Oh, yeah. I think it's divine. [Chihiro chuckles] Divine? Keith. He's so great. He's my favorite also. [Chihiro chuckles] Hey. Basil! Oh, God! - [Basil] It's been a long time. [chuckles] - [Chihiro] Mmm! [inhales] - [Basil] I brought wine. [chuckling] - Thank you. Shall we? - [Basil] What's with the obscene house? - [Chihiro] Hmm? It's not obscene. [Basil] Look at the reflected lights on the water. It's obscene. [chuckles] Come in. [Basil] I will, thank you. [scoffs] Your room's unprotected, as always. [Chihiro] You think? - So, what are you doing? - [Chihiro] Hmm? For work? I work at a bento shop. Hey? You sell bentos? - [Chihiro] I think it suits me. - [Basil chuckling] Oh yeah, a girl I work with said there's some guy looking for you. He's got your photo and has been asking around, "Has anyone seen this girl?" [Chihiro] Hmm... [Basil] Do you know who he could be? Well, you know how I was. Always number one, yeah? [Basil chuckling] You quit suddenly without telling your regulars. Anyone hold a grudge? That's the nature of that world. Besides, always leave them wanting more, as they say. [Basil] Well, yeah, but... I did hear a rumor you moved around different shops. But a bento shop is unexpected. [Chihiro chuckling] Hey! What's wrong? It's my shop. [Chihiro] Hmm? My partner disappeared and took the money. - How much? - All of it. I was so excited about having my own shop. And now I have to start all over again. I guess when it comes to character, I have... no judgment. The exception is you. You can come here anytime to talk. If you want to work in a bento shop, I know people. Hey? Me? Selling bentos? [chuckling] You are kidding! [laughing] ENCYCLOPEDIA OF CRYPTIDS - [birds chirping] - [children shouting in the distance] [siren wailing in the distance] Hey, lady, what are you doing? Well, what does it look like? I'm reading a book. Okay. Be careful. You know, around here, there are lots of poisonous snakes. - [Chihiro] Mmm. - Like that! - [Chihiro gasping] - [boy laughs] [continues laughing] [Chihiro] What is this? Aw, you're no fun! Give it back! Give it back, granny! [grunting] [continues grunting] Let go, you old bag! How about you shut it? Shut up, old bag! - You don't mess around with adults. - [boy grunts] - [groaning] - [sinister music playing] What are you doing? Let go of me, granny. [screams] Let go! [screams] [Chihiro groans] [sinister music continues] [music fades] - [Chihiro] One hamburger bento, please. - I didn't know you had a kid. He's not mine. [Nagai] Hmm! What's his name? What's your name? Makoto. Makoto, he said. [Nagai] Huh. Hey! Aren't you going to say grace? Thank you for the food. Your arm, is it okay? Don't worry, it's okay. It's not the first time. Have you been stabbed before? I have. It was right here. Wanna look? Who stabbed you? - [Chihiro] Hmm... - [relaxing music playing] Someone who liked me a little too much. Liked you? Why? [chuckles] You know, you're right. It's a mystery. [relaxing music continues] I'm sorry. Well, that doesn't count. If you apologize, you have to look the person in the eye. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. It's okay. - You're forgiven. - [chuckling] Stop it! - [chuckling] Stop it! - [Chihiro chuckling] [Makoto continues chuckling] [water splashing gently] [relaxing music continues] [breathes deeply] [music fades] [birds squawking] [Kuniko] Excuse me. Can I stand with you? [Chihiro] Sure. [water splashing gently] [Kuniko] Um... Aren't you going to ask me anything? [Chihiro] Why? Do you want me to ask you something? [Kuniko] It's not that I wanted you to. People get curious, usually. Things like name, age, intentions... Don't you worry if you don't know who someone is? [Chihiro] I've never relied on that sort of thing. [Kuniko] Huh? [Chihiro] Besides, you never know if they're telling you the truth. That's how it was as a sex worker. [soft music playing] Oh. If you want to know who someone is, look into their eyes. [chuckles lightly] [sighs] Just kidding. But seriously, I think you're an okay kid. [soft music continues] [Kuniko sniffles] [phone buzzing] [Kuniko sighs loudly] Parents? [Kuniko] Oh. Yes. [Chihiro] Mmm. [soft music continues] [Kuniko chuckling] [both laughing] [music fades] [breathes deeply] SATOKO: KARAOKE TODAY? MIHARU: SURE SATOKO: YOU WATCH SE-YUGU? MANA: YOU BET MIHARU: RANFIL DESCENDED! [teacher] Now, a plus b over 2 is the arithmetic mean of a and b. ...and the square root of a times b is called geometric mean. The inequality of arithmetic and geometric means...

[door opening loudly] [door closing loudly] [Makoto's mom] I'm home. [sighing] [exhales heavily] I'm so tired. [exhales] [grunts] Mmm. [groans] I feel sick. [birds chirping] [paper rustling] [Tae] Aya, is your mother going to be in the hospital for long? [Chihiro] Mmm. It looks like it might be a while. - Oh. - [Chihiro] Mmm. How nice if she could be home. [Chihiro] Yeah. - [Chihiro] How about you, Tae? - [Tae] Hmm? Are you going to be returning? To the bento shop? Ooh, I don't know. Is there anything I could do without my eyes? [Chihiro] Mm-hmm. I think there is. - Really? - [Chihiro] Mmm. [Tae chuckling] I heard the new bento girl is excellent. So, I wonder now, uh... Is there even a place for me to return to at the shop? [both chuckling] I'm sure there is. They say she's a weird girl, but a lot of fun, though. - She's weird? - [Tae] Mm-hmm. [Chihiro chuckling] - Oh, is this the middle? I can't tell. - [Chihiro] It looks right. - [Chihiro] That's it, yeah. - [Tae] Mmm. Okay. Now I feel it. - Does it look right? - [Chihiro] Yeah. Now I'm doing the crease. - [Tae] Okay. [laughs] - [Chihiro] That's good. [laughs] [Chihiro] So the old man... Have you seen him lately? Oh. The Master? Master? The homeless man who often used to come here, right? [chuckling] You call him the Master? [girl chuckling] Just in my mind, of course. I've never spoken to him. Master, huh? It suits him. [birds squawking] [Chihiro] Hmm. He's not here.

It's cool... And we use stage names too, like sumo. Mmm. I guess so. [relaxing music continues] - Here. One try, please. - [man] Okay. One try, 100 yen. - Here, this side up. - [Chihiro] Okay. - [Basil] Here. One, please. - [man] Thank you. [Chihiro] Ooh. [man] Good luck. [Chihiro chuckles] Aw. [sighs] One more try. [man] Sure. [chuckles] Oh. You've caught so many! [Chihiro] Oh. [sighs] [older man exhaling] Ah... - You never let your prey escape? - [Basil and men chuckling] Hang on, are you sure these aren't faulty? Boss? Wha... My God, Chihiro! [laughing] - What the hell are you doing here? - What are you doing here? [chuckles] Hey? Well, I work here! [chuckling] [chuckling] So then... - [laughing] You're alive? - [laughing] Of course. What are you doing here, boss? Yeah. Well, uh... after you left I, um... got a divorce. Is that so? Yeah. And being free of obligations, I went into the fish business. And when I say fish, I mean tropical aquariums. [customer] Yeah, that one. And really, I was sick of that world... The underground. - [customer 2] It is! - [Chihiro] Mm-hmm. And you? What are you doing? I work at a bento shop, if you can believe that? Bento? No way. - [laughing] Chihiro, the bento girl. - [man] Thank you, come again. - [Chihiro chuckles] - Oh boy! I'd be frightened you'd poison them! - [laughing] - Eh? No. That's mean. I'm popular there! So rude... Chihiro, you're full of it. I bet only popular with the old and blind. - [laughing] - [Chihiro] Shut up! Honey, did you sleep with your boss? Huh? I did not! Oh, it sure looked like it to me. Oh? - Hey? Honey, you're so bad! - [Chihiro giggling] You haven't changed. [Okaji] Hey... What? How did you get five? Huh? Ugh. You're subtracting from four, so you should've got less than four. Why? [chuckles] No. Not "why?" Look, you subtract seven from 11, okay? Then you subtract from there. And then... What? Why did you add here? [birds chirping] THIRD-GRADE MATH 3. DIVISION MAKOTO SATAKE You're pretty dumb, aren't you, kid? Shut up, ugly. Huh? You're way rude! I think your brain is broken. It's so sad. You're ugly with no personality. Huh? What are you talking about? - I'm helping you study, idiot. - [Makoto laughing] [chuckling] I never asked you to, ugly! - Huh? - [Chihiro] Oh, you two get along so well! - Hey! We do not. - No, we don't. - Hey, I want that. - [laughing] No, it's mine. What? No. - Ah. Come on, trade with me. - Makoto, have you finished your homework? - [Makoto chuckling] No. - I've been trying, but he ignores me, and writes random numbers. - [Chihiro] Hey. - [Okaji] Aw. Don't do that. - You have to teach him properly. - I am doing it properly! But he won't listen to me at all. - [Chihiro] Makoto? - So, it's your fault! - Are you trying? - [chuckling] Yes, I'm trying. - No, he's lying. He's not trying at all! - You're the one who's doing it wrong! What? I'm the only one who's trying at all! [Chihiro chuckles] [birds chirping] [Chihiro] Okaji, if you eat that now will you be able to eat at home tonight? What? Is your mother a terrible cook or something? - [Chihiro chuckling] - [Okaji chuckling] Mm-mm. It's the opposite. [Chihiro] Hmm? No, my mom is a really good cook. She's a certified chef. She makes perfect meals. Except... [Chihiro] Except? When I sit at the table, I taste nothing. [chuckles] Um... she really takes care of me, and I'm grateful. [Chihiro] Mmm. Maybe that's her idea of the perfect wife? Or your dad's idea of the perfect wife. I don't understand people like that. [Okaji] Hmm? When I was a kid, I saw some norimaki and imagined it was delicious. So I tried to make them myself. I made a mess of them, but they were delicious. They say food tastes better when you eat with someone else. Sometimes with the wrong people, things can taste bad. But with the right people, the food will taste delicious. [gentle music playing] My mother makes stir-fried noodles. It's really delicious. Really delicious, huh? Mmm. Really delicious. [Chihiro] Years ago, a client of mine told me that he thought we were all aliens in human bodies. - [Okaji] Aliens in human bodies? - [Chihiro] Yeah. They say that we're all human. [gentle music continues] It's not true. Actually, we all come from different planets. So really, it's no wonder we can't understand each other. Even families? What about lovers? What about friends? It's no use. You know? It doesn't matter, because we're all from different planets. Don't you think it makes a lot of sense? [gentle music continues] We're all aliens. Although they must exist somewhere. What? Some people from my planet. Same as me. Of course. For instance, Okaji and Makoto, right here. Huh? No way. We're definitely from different planets! - [groans] - [chuckling] Of course. - Here. - What's this? A treasure map. A treasure map? Go there and see. [music fades] Makoto! - [Makoto] Makoto is this... [chuckles] - [Chihiro] Hey! [both laughing] [Chihiro] Take that! - [Makoto chuckling] What are you doing? - [Chihiro chuckling] Take that! - Come on, get up. - [Makoto] Hold on. [Chihiro] I'm leaving without you. [both continue laughing] - [Chihiro] Tag, you're it! Tag you back. - [Makoto laughing] I'll get you. [Chihiro] You're it! - [Okaji laughing] Whoa! - [Makoto yelling] I'll break yours. [inaudible] [Okaji and Makoto yelling] [Chihiro screaming] [birds screeching in the distance] [Chihiro yawning] Madam. What a beautiful day it is. [chuckling] [phone buzzing] [phone continues buzzing] [sighs] What do you want? [man on phone] Oh, hello? Finally got in touch with you. Can you talk now? Mmm. What is it? [man] It's Mom. She passed away. Oh. [man] I've been asking all over, looking for you, sis. Where are you now? Are you okay? [Chihiro] Mmm. I'm fine. [man] Oh, good. Will you come to the funeral? [Chihiro] Mmm... I will not. [man sighs] Right. Okay. - So... - Oh... Sorry, I have to go back to work. [man] Oh, do you? Okay. Talk to later. [Chihiro] Mmm. [man] Well, I'll call again. [Chihiro] Mmm. [man] Bye. Well, good night. I'm back from my break. - Thank you very much. - [male customer] Thank you. - Hi. Welcome. - [Makoto's mom] Are you Chihiro? Yes, may I help you? I'm Makoto's mother. Ah. I want you to stop associating with my son. You go around feeding him. Well, my neighbors are saying I don't look after him properly. As a single parent, I can't be there all the time. But I'm trying my absolute best to do everything I can for him. I get that you don't understand, you're not just feeding a stray dog. You need to understand that what you're doing could be damaging. I can raise my own child, so would you leave us alone! I am sorry. I sincerely apologize. Please forgive me for my lack of consideration. [Makoto's mom sighs] [Okaji's dad] So, about our trip this weekend... The pottery teacher is looking forward to meeting you. My friend told me Kuniko's visit inspired him to get some special new clay for you to use. Really? Isn't that nice? I searched online for his pottery, and the ones I saw were excellent. [Okaji's dad] So, now you're a pottery expert? Well, no. I guess you're right. I apologize. [Okaji] Oh. I'm sorry. This weekend, I made plans with my friend. You should go and enjoy it. What? Why? But, Kuniko, you know we've had this planned for a while. You were excited about it. [Okaji's dad] So, what are these special plans? Do tell us. Do you think anything is more important than family? [Okaji's mom] You could cancel your plans, couldn't you? Mmm. I'll ask. Please do that. [Okaji's dad breathes deeply] - [microwave whirring] - [pouring liquid] [microwave beeping] [jar clatters] [dad and son singing on television] ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪ ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪ ♪ Happy birthday, dear Mommy ♪ ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪ - [boy] Happy birthday, Mom. - [dad] Happy birthday. [boy] Here Mom, these are for you. They're gorgeous. You bought these? [boy] Mm-hmm. I saved up my allowance. [mom] Oh. Thank you. This is the best gift I've ever received. [boy] Wow, I'm glad! [mysterious music playing] [birds chirping] TREASURE MAP HERE!! COME ON IN ANYTIME! [mysterious music continues] [music fades] You must be Chihiro's acquaintance. [Okaji] Oh. Yes. [girl] Mmm. You can sit down wherever you like. I'm Betchin. What's your name? [Okaji] Betchin. Oh. I'm Seo. Seo Kuniko. Everyone calls me Okaji. [Betchin] Seo? Why Okaji? Oh, it's a super long story. [Betchin chuckling] Mmm. You go to Nishiko? Right, Nishiko High. Our uniforms are the same... Mm-hmm, Nishiko. First year? Second year. [Betchin] Shut up! We're in the same year. I'm in class three. Though I don't go very often. I'm what you'd call an absentee student. Oh... Okay, then. How do you know Chihiro? Oh... I often get thrown out of the house, so I come here to kill time. Chihiro sometimes comes here too. And now we're manga mates. [Okaji] Manga mates? Any you like, you're welcome to them. Uh-huh. [boat horn sounding in the distance] This one's hard. Could be too difficult, I think. [chuckling] Easy. I used to have one just the same. You did? [chuckles] Well then, it'll be easy! [both chuckling] One. [chuckles nervously] Two. Three. Four. [chuckles] Five. Six. Seven. - [laughing] - [Chihiro chuckling] Ooh! [rattling] [Tae] An acorn? [Chihiro] Mmm. Are you giving this to me? [Chihiro] Mmm. It's yours now. Aw. Thank you, Aya. [sighs] You know... I remember when my daughter turned 20. We went to a hot springs resort. [inhales sharply] Oh, it was nice. We went and bathed together, collected acorns... And also found chestnuts. [sighs] However, my daughter was bored by all those things. I'd booked the hotel for two nights, but we didn't stay. She wasn't interested in those acorns we collected when once she would have been. Hmm. It's no wonder. [inhales sharply] She... wasn't a kid anymore. It goes so fast. She was more of an adult than I was. [sad music playing] I wanted that if I said, "This is nice," that someone would say, "That is nice." And if I asked, "Right?" someone would say, "That's right." I guess... ...that's all I ever wanted. [sad music continues] [waves crashing] [footsteps treading] [sad music continues] [music fades] [screeching in the distance] [gentle music playing] [gentle music continues] [woman] So did you make that yourself? [young Chihiro] Except, I kind of messed it up. [woman] Can I try one? It's good. [chuckles] [loud rustling in the background] [gentle music continues] [sighs] Don't be afraid. The nighttime is on our side. [chuckling] Mmm! [young Chihiro] Hey, are there any rabbits on the moon? [woman chuckling] Of course not. Why? [young Chihiro] No reason. Just asking. [Chihiro] That way? Okay, bye. Hmm? [gentle music continues] A gift? [woman chuckles] Thank you. Chihiro's my name. You can ask for me at this shop. Bye-bye. CHIHIRO PLEASE COME AGAIN 2,000-YEN DISCOUNT WITH THIS CARD [music fades] [humming] [continues humming] [continues humming] [man 1] What do you mean you can't do it? Just do it! I'm sorry, we can't. [man 1] I'm the customer. Do it! - We just don't make that here. - [man 2] Apologize. [man 1] What? [man 2] Apologize. [man 1 scoffs] Mind your own business. Look, just do what I want. [chair clattering] Apologize. [shouting] Apologize to the cook! Let go. Hello, miss. - [man 1] What a crock! - [chair clattering] What a useless place. I'll never be back. Can I order? Uh, uh... yeah. - One beer and shoyu ramen and also... - [cook] Beer. Are the gyoza large? Uh, uh... no. Not really large. - Regular size. - And one of them. Uh... of course. - Here's your order. - Oh. Thank you. [cook] Here's your beer. [man 2] Looks good. - [Chihiro gulping] - [man 2 blowing food] [slurping noodles] [blowing noodles] - Here. - [man 2] Thanks. [can hissing open] [Chihiro sighs] [man 2] I... I'm really sorry for causing a scene. What scene? Was it awkward? I always want ramen after I bury something that's dead. [man 2] Chihiro, is killing people your real job? How'd you guess? [both chuckling] [man 2] Oh, this? It's like a personal mantra. Looking at it reminds me to stay calm. But when I see people who are like my father... I can't stand it. Acting like they can say and do anything, bullying people weaker than them... It kind of makes me lose it. It got pretty bad with my father. I thought I was gonna die. [chuckling] I hit him with a baseball bat. And I left home right then... ...never returned. It never made the news, so I'm sure he lived. [Chihiro sighs] FORM IS EMPTINESS [man 2 chuckles] Do you feel sorry for me? I'm not kind enough for that. Chihiro. Have you ever truly wanted to die? I have. Why? I... Never mind. If you meet your father again, and he tries to kill you... mmm... kill him first. If I do, will you help me bury him? But of course. For a bowl of ramen. [man 2 laughing] I'd like to have sex. [breathing heavily] [kissing] [breathing heavily] [oil sizzling] [Basil] Don't you ever fall in love? [Chihiro] Hmm? [Basil] I've always wondered about that. You never seem to be attached to anyone. Mmm... what I mean is, don't you want someone just for you? To want someone so much that it hurts? You don't have those feelings? I did a long time ago. I thought love was meant to be like that. - But these days... - [Basil] Mmm? - I don't believe that. - Why? You cannot own someone's heart exclusively. Also, I don't want to be owned. [Basil] Mmm. - I realized... - [Basil] Mmm. If love is about owning, well, then I don't need love. - I can't get drunk on love. - [Basil chuckles] What do you mean? [Chihiro blowing food] Mmm... Hmm... It's like people who can't drink alcohol. There are some people who get sick from drinking it, and even die. And so, why would you drink it at all? You can live a happy life sober, right? Yeah. But what about... making love? You don't need that either? [Chihiro] Hmm... That's a slightly different story. A bit like needing to drink water to live. Yeah, but it's nice to love them. Oh, Jesus, I sound like such a virgin. You might think that's important. [inhales deeply] I don't really need to have feelings for them. [Basil] Mmm... I don't understand that. [Chihiro] Hmm... Well, I have found on this planet many others like me. I'm starved. - [Chihiro] Please, we have plenty. - [Basil] Mmm! - Delicious. Mmm. - [Chihiro] Really? Yay! [laughing] [Chihiro breathing softly] - [Miharu] You were sleeping, weren't you? - [Mana] How did you know? [Miharu chuckling] I saw you. You were like this on the desk. - [Mana] Seriously? - [Satoko chuckling] Completely asleep. No way. Everybody saw? Really? Oh. That looks great. [slurps] Betchin. [Betchin] Hmm? If I hadn't met you, I might've drowned and died in this school. [Betchin chuckles] So dramatic. [Okaji sighs] I wonder... Why are you so strong? I don't think I am. I was an absentee, wasn't I? Oh, yeah. [Betchin] I don't expect much. [Okaji] Hmm? Not expecting much from myself or others is a lot easier. I read that in a manga. I get a little scared. Scared of making friends. But I'm also scared to be alone. Betchin. Although... I'm also glad I met you. Mmm! Betchin! [laughing] Hey! That's tight! [chuckling] It's tight! Hey, it hurts! What are you doing? - [Okaji laughing] Hang on. Wait. - [Betchin] Jeez! Let go! A bit more, a bit more. - What? A bit more? - Oh. Just a little. [chuckling] Give up, give up. - [chuckling] Enough, Okaji. - [Okaji laughing] So, the sixth of next month is when she can go home. Thank you for taking such care of her. Tae. Are you glad to be going home soon? Yes. And you've all been so kind. [footsteps approaching] [bouquet clattering] So these... your idea, were they? Did you think I'd cry tears of happiness? MOM, HAPPY BIRTHDAY. MAKOTO He's not the kind of kid who'd do this on his own. Stop trying to taunt me and mind your own business! - [Chihiro sighs] - Huh? No. You will regret it if you throw these away. What? Don't sell yourself so short. - Don't you know he is like that? - [scoffs] Huh? How the hell would you know? You're just a stranger! Makoto is really kind. How does his own mother not see that? Anyone else can see it. While eating a rice ball from this shop he said, "My mother's stir-fried noodles are the most delicious there are." Take a good look at him. - [smooth jazz music playing] - I had nothing to do with these flowers. Only him. Please. [smooth jazz music continues] [Chihiro's ex-boss] Oh, that one? It's sleeping. [Basil] He's sleeping? [Chihiro's ex-boss] Yeah. When they sleep, they lie still on the bottom And when they wake, they float up and start swimming around again. How unusual. [smooth jazz music continues and fades] I wonder what dream it's having. [chuckling softly] [chuckles softly] [fish tank whirring] [phone buzzing] [phone continues buzzing] - [Chihiro] Hello? - [ex-boss over the phone] Hey. [Chihiro] Yeah? [exhales] [ex-boss] You know your friend, the one I met at the festival the other day? [chuckling] She visited my shop and decided to work here. [Chihiro] Hey? [chuckles] How did that happen? [exhales] She wants to work here when she's not working at the club. And she said she'll work for free. Did you know she liked tropical fish? [Chihiro] Bazi's never mentioned that to me before. [ex-boss sighs] Anyway, where are you now? Basil and I are going out for a drink. Would you like to come? [Chihiro] Uh... Not right now. I'm at the bottom of the sea. [ex-boss chuckles] You're under the sea? Then you should stay there a while. Generally, humans tend to float. [Chihiro chuckles] You mean dead bodies float? [ex-boss] Dead or alive, they float, you know? When you're calm, you float. But when you panic and struggle, that's when you sink. So, stay there as long as you need to, and when you float back up, I'll take you out somewhere. Anywhere you want to go? [knocking on door] [Okaji] Chihiro? [doorknob rattling] Hey, not so hard. You'll break it. - [Makoto] No, I won't. - [clattering continues] [Okaji] Stop. You're making too much noise! - [rattling continues] - [Makoto] She'll hear us this way. [Okaji] No. Let's just call out from the street. - [Makoto] What about from there? - [Okaji] Can you see anything? - Let's call out from over there. - [Makoto] Mmm. [footsteps descending stairs] [Okaji] But seriously, I hope she's not passed out or something. - [Makoto] She's not. - [Okaji] Huh? [Makoto] If she was passed out, we'd sense it. - [footsteps descending stairs] - [Okaji] Ahh. But if she was unconscious... [Makoto] Wouldn't you sense it? Hello! Are you alive? Are you dead? [Okaji] Hey! Stop that, stupid! [Makoto] You're the one who said she might be unconscious. [Okaji] Just because I said that doesn't mean she's dead! [Makoto] Huh? Are you scared? [Okaji] No, I'm not scared. [Makoto] Oh, okay. I'll believe that. [shouting] Hey! [Okaji] God, I really hope she's okay. [Makoto shouting] Hey! - [Okaji] Chihiro! Are you okay? - [Makoto] Chihiro! - Oh. She's there! - [Makoto] A-ha! [window sliding open] [Makoto giggling] Wow. She looks terrible. [Okaji chuckles] Chihiro, are you okay? [chuckles softly] Be quiet. - I told you you were too loud. - It's your fault. I didn't wake her up. - I brought these for you. - We brought you some stuff. I brought bananas. Just leave it there. - [Okaji] Uh... I could just hand it to you. - [Makoto] Hey! No! - We wanna give it to you. - [Chihiro] Go home already. - [Okaji] Hey? - [Makoto] Let us in! - Let us in! - [Okaji] Can't you see us for a minute? - Go put it on the doorknob. - [Okaji] Huh? We wanna hand it to you. - Go on, go home. - [Makoto] Don't want to. - It's getting late. - [Okaji] But we came all the way here. [Makoto] We don't want to hang it on the door knob. We could give it to a baseball star and ask for... - [Chihiro] Ah! - [Okaji and Makoto] Huh? [both screaming] - Just a minute, Chihiro. - [Makoto screaming] Wait! [Okaji] What? [Makoto chuckling] Aw. She's so mean. [footsteps approaching slowly] Ah. Still alive? [laughing] [car engine revving] UTSUMI TROPICAL FISH SHOP [birds chirping] [birds continue chirping] [birds chirping louder] [leaves rustling] [wind blowing] [vehicle approaching in the background] [box rattling] [objects rattling] [rattling continues] [box clatters] [box clatters] [paper rustles] [birds continue chirping] Here we are. [grunts] [door opening] [door closing] [seatbelt clicking] [door opening] - [ex-boss] Did you sleep well? - [Chihiro] Mmm. [ex-boss sighs deeply and inhales] [both exhale deeply] Hey, boss. - [ex-boss] Huh? - Listen. [ex-boss] Ah. So, I've been thinking for a really long time. About? We're all from different planets. - [ex-boss chuckling] Huh? - [Chihiro] I'm sure of it. I'm pretty sure that you like me, but you've never tried to make any kind of sexual advances. [ex-boss laughing] [Chihiro] I always wondered why that was. I just couldn't seem to work it out. But I know what it is. [ex-boss] Mmm. It all makes sense to me now. Eh? [chuckling] What... What are you saying? It has to be that you're my father, yeah? [birds chirping] [laughing] Are you kidding? - Me? - [Chihiro] Hmm. [laughing] No way. Why? [Chihiro] Why? It's the only thing that makes sense. - [laughing] That... - [Chihiro] Hmm. ...I'm your dad? - Right. - [continues laughing] Oh, I am, huh? [chuckling] Her father? [ex-boss] Yeah. Oh, wow. She must really have a screw loose. Indeed. However, I'll go along with it, as weird as it is. It's fun though, right? [Chihiro] Oh, hi. What's up? Come in. Hey. What's the matter? You said that you'd never slept with your former boss. It's true. You never said you went out with him the other day. Ah... But there wasn't much to tell you about. Is that right? Be honest, Chihiro. You like him. I used to admire that I thought you'd always tell the truth. Come on. I've never lied to you. You know I only ever tell you the truth. - So you say. - [Chihiro] I told you before. I can't get drunk on love. I always liked my old boss. However, it's not like a romantic relationship. [Basil chuckles] So now you think he's your father? Hey... There's more than just sex between men and women. - Things aren't that simple. - [chuckles] That's ridiculous. We're all still men and women. And even if you want him... it does not mean he feels the same! For God's sake, say something. I think you were right. You have no judgment. Huh? You won't get my old boss. Impossible. - Don't even try. - Huh? Why are we discussing this on the doorstep? - [chuckles] What does it matter? - [Chihiro] Just come in, already. No, I'm done.

[Makoto over the phone] Um, hello. It's Makoto. [emotionally] Are you free now, Okaji? Huh? I'm busy now. Why? [Makoto] It's just that I'm hungry. Hey? Where's your mom? She's at work. So, uh... What are you doing? I'm waiting at the front door of my house. - [rain pattering] - [Okaji] Why don't you go inside? Can't find my key. [Okaji] What? It's usually in my pocket, except it's not there.

[sad music continues] [groans] That rain is wild! - Let's close for today. - [Nagai] Forget that. There's an emergency! The hospital called a while ago. I was trying to get hold of you! Wait, wait. Slow down. What is it? What's happened? - Tae's gone. Vanished from the hospital! - [elderly man] What? [Nagai] They said she was in her room with a visitor, a girl named Aya, and then she vanished. Aya? The girl was saying that her mother was staying at the same hospital. But when they checked, they couldn't find any evidence of her. Aya? [Nagai] What are you doing? You should be rushing to the hospital! Bito! [sad music continues] [dialing telephone] - [Bito] No answer. - [receiver clatters] Aya is actually Chihiro. Look. [Nagai] What? RÉSUMÉ AYA FURUSAWA [Bito] Chihiro is the name she used at her former job. AGE: 29 [Chihiro's ex-boss] I dealt with many girls at the massage parlor, but she was the hardest to work out. [scoffs] She has the kind of character you never quite get. In a way, she seemed empty. It's strange to say, she's like a ghost. [chewing food] When she came to interview at the massage parlor, ah... [chuckling] I didn't know what to think. She looked so out of place. Just a regular and modest girl. Even now, she looks like that asleep. [both chuckle lightly] - [Chihiro's ex-boss] Except... - [Basil] Mmm. When I looked down, her shoes were worn and dirty. ...and the wrong size for her feet. I think... if she hadn't walked through my door that day, she might not still be alive. Okay. You can start tomorrow. Aren't you... going to ask any questions? Huh? [Chihiro] Like... what are my reasons for being here? Where else have I worked? [breathes deeply] I don't need to ask. I'm talking to the person in front of me now. So... what do you want your work name to be? What do you think? [chuckling] No. I can't choose your name. It's yours, so you choose. Uh... Chihiro. Mmm. [breathing heavily] So as of today, Chihiro is your name. [inhales] So, Chihiro... Welcome. [Chihiro exhales] - Thanks. - Mmm. RÉSUMÉ AYA FURUSAWA "Aya Furusawa." Uh... I like to be called Chihiro. [Bito] Chihiro? Chihiro is kind of my nickname. [Tae chuckling] It's like I'm having an affair. [Chihiro chuckles] Uh... more like eloping. [Tae] Or perhaps a double suicide? [Chihiro laughing] A double suicide? Thank you, Aya, for taking me out. [Chihiro chuckles] So, Tae... when did you work it out? [Tae] Hmm? When did you realize I was Chihiro from the shop? Not telling. [Chihiro laughing] [rain pattering] The rain makes me feel happy. [Chihiro] Mmm. [window opening] [rain continues pattering] [rain continues pattering] [Tae sighs] [sighing] Hello! One seaweed bento, please. Okay. One seaweed bento. [Bito] Coming up. With the weather like this today, here's a little gift for you. [Chihiro] Really? That's so nice! [both chuckling] Tell me, why are you open on a day like this? Oh. Well... I love the rain. It always makes me feel like going out, maybe to go dancing. [laughing] I thought, "There must be others out there like me." [rain continues pattering] And you, dear? Just finished work? No. Right now I'm not working. Not long ago I quit my job. Oh. So what were you doing? [Chihiro chuckles] I was a sex worker. Ooh! [Chihiro] In that moment, I thought, "Ah! This woman... is maybe from the same planet I am from." It only happened one time before. - One of my people. - [Tae] Hmm. So... Then... when was the other time? [Chihiro] When I met Chihiro. [rain pouring heavily] Sorry I couldn't get something nicer. That's okay. It's nice. [Okaji chuckles] You want one? It's okay. It's for you. I had dinner. [rain continues pouring heavily] [thunder cracking] [umbrella clattering] Makoto? [Makoto chuckling] - What are you doing? - [mom] Makoto. MOM, HAPPY BIRTHDAY. MAKOTO [food sizzling] [sighs] How did you lose your key? You've no idea where it is? [Makoto] Mm-mm. [sighs] Now I have to get another key. Really, you're just hopeless. Right? [chuckles] Yeah. [mom] Here you go. - Thanks for the food. - Okay. - Thank you. - Sure. Ah... jeez. It's so messy. Sorry for the mess. And who messed it up? [Makoto] No idea. I doubt that very much. Is it good? Yes. [Okaji sobbing] [mom] Eh? [Okaji continues sobbing] - [mom] What's wrong? - [Makoto] Okaji, what's wrong? - [mom] Oh, what is it? - [Okaji] I'm sorry. - [Makoto] What's the matter? - [mom] Hey? - Are you in pain? - [Okaji continues sobbing] [mom] Are you okay? [Okaji continues sobbing] [Chihiro] My mom died. But... I felt nothing. No sadness, no regret, no loneliness. Honestly, I didn't feel a thing. [chuckles] I didn't cry once. [Tae] Hmm. I wonder if you had been my mother, what kind of person I could've become? [exhaling] Oh, well... I imagine... ...no more wonderful than you are now. Hey? I'm saying... you're wonderful just as you are. [Chihiro sighing] Yeah. That's hard to see. [Tae chuckling] [sighs] Hey. [Chihiro] Hmm? Come on. Come here. Hey? What? [Tae chuckling lightly] Let me give you a hug. - [laughing] Hey? What for? - [Tae laughing] Just one. [chuckling lightly] [Tae] Mmm. - Nice. - [Chihiro chuckles] Yeah, but it's still really weird. Good, though. [peaceful music playing] How does it feel? I like it. [peaceful music continues] [Tae] Mmm... a warm hug. [Chihiro] Mmm. And you smell good. [Tae chuckles and sighs] [peaceful music continues] [birds chirping in the background] [Makoto giggling] - [Okaji] Hey, wait. - [Chihiro] Watch out, you two. [Makoto continues giggling] [Okaji] What are you doing? Hey! - [Makoto continues giggling] - [Chihiro] The kids are great together. - [Okaji] No, that's dangerous! - Hey, hey! Careful. - [Okaji] Don't play with bottles. - [Makoto giggling] Now, top speed! [Okaji] Oh, crap. [Makoto continues giggling] [Okaji] Hey! - [sighs] You're impossible. - [Chihiro] Hey! Okaji and Makoto, come and help. - [Makoto] Okay. - [Okaji] All right. - Take that to the table? - [Okaji] Okay. - Ah! - What? Ugh! - Uh. What are you doing? - [Bito and Nagai laughing] What? So cheeky. [Makoto] You're cheeky. Watch your mouth. [Bito and Tae laughing] They're all done. I bet this will be really delicious. [Bito laughing] Uh... now, Aya or Chihiro? Which do you want to be called? [Chihiro] Hmm... Let's see... [Okaji] Chihiro? - [Chihiro's ex-boss] Are you warm enough? - Can I help with anything else? Time to eat now. [Okaji exhales] Okay. [Chihiro chuckles] [Chihiro and Bito laughing] - [Bito] No. - [Nagai] Don't do that. - Don't eat it with your hands. - [Makoto] Why not? - [Bito and ex-boss laughing] - [Nagai] What? You like carrots? - [Okaji] I'm eating one piece at a time. - [Nagai] I'll eat it. [Tae sighs] I've got it. I can feel it. - Thank you. - [Bito] Yeah? Okay. - Careful, it's got a sticky glaze. - [Tae] Mm-hmm. [Nagai] It got very quiet. [Tae] Mmm. [chuckling] [Chihiro's ex-boss] Do you want some more? [Basil] I've eaten plenty already. - [Bito] That's good. - [calm music playing] - [Makoto] I'd have to fatten up... - [ex-boss] The miso soup's still warm. [Makoto] Wear glasses, and get really nerdy. - [Bito] ...so is the red bean paste. - [Basil] Which should I eat next? [Okaji] Whoa! Are you talking about me? - [Tae] Yes. [groans] - [Okaji] These two wear glasses as well. - [Chihiro's ex-boss] We just did. - [Makoto] The other person. - [Bito laughing] - [Okaji] You really piss me off. - [Makoto] This one. - [Okaji] Are you still talking about me? - [Bito] Ooh! More? - [Makoto] Ooh, scary! [calm music continues] - [Basil] Thanks, I'll have some. - [Okaji laughing] - Hey! Don't tell everyone! - [Makoto] You did? Okaji. That's the worst! [chuckling] - [Okaji] No. It's not like that. - You're so noisy. - You are! - [Okaji chuckling] - [Makoto roaring] - [chuckling] Hey? What was that? - [Nagai] Do you want more soup? - What? [Nagai] Will I get you some? - [Makoto] Okaji, you can have this. - [Basil] You're good at that. Really? Then I'll make something for you. - [Makoto] Don't eat too much. - [Chihiro's ex-boss] You will? What will you make? - [Basil chuckling] Hmm... - [Makoto] You might get fat again. My specialty is pork miso soup. - You're lying. [laughing] - [Basil laughing] That or... What do you like? [calm music continues] [Chihiro's ex-boss] Oh, well, I love slow-cooked food. [Basil] Then, I'll make slow-cooked chicken. [Chihiro's ex-boss] Can you make it for me? [Basil] I can. [music fades] [phone buzzing] Hello? [exhales] [Tae over the phone] Hello? You left early. [Chihiro] Hmm. I was having a good time. I was getting drunk, and that's rare. [Tae] I see. [Chihiro] Hmm. And how could you tell that I was gone? Easy. Suddenly, the air of loneliness was gone. That's hard not to notice. [Chihiro laughing] Tae, you're able to see a great deal. [chuckles lightly] [Tae] Mmm... So... Are you thinking of going far away? Hey? [Tae] It's okay. You can stop running away now. No matter how fast you run or how far you go, your loneliness will follow. Well... until tomorrow, then. Until then. [birds chirping in the background] HELP WANTED (URGENT) PART-TIME WORKER MAINLY TAKING ORDERS, CASHIER [Bito inhales and exhales] [Tae chuckles] What is it? I, uh... Um... I'm reminded of when we, uh... opened this shop, we would do this together. Hey? You and I, we'd prepare food all night. Never much time for us to sleep. [Tae chuckles] So I said, "How about we get pre-peeled chestnuts to save some time?" And Tae, what did you say, hmm? [Tae chuckles] I don't remember. What did I say? You said, "It would be nice not to have to do it... but then you'd miss out on the fun of peeling the chestnuts." [both chuckling] Oh, now I remember. [Bito] I was so surprised that you might enjoy such unglamorous work. And you saying that made me love you even more. [Tae chuckles] I thought, "How did you get such a good wife?" Ah, what are you on about? Ahh... just reminiscing. Thank you, Tae, for marrying someone like me. [Tae exhaling] Ah, you old fool. [chuckles] Chihiro leaving must make you a bit sad. It does. Yeah. I miss her. [Tae chuckling] Mmm. She really was something special, wasn't she? - Yeah. - [Tae] Mmm. Hey. Can I ask you something? [Bito] Mmm. What was it that made you decide to hire Chihiro? - The reason? - [Tae] Mmm. [joyful music playing] Let's see... I'm so sorry... [Bito] I left the interview on purpose to watch what she did. Here is a leftover. I gave her an extra bento we had left over from lunch that day. - [Chihiro] Oh. You sure? - [Bito] I'll be back. [joyful music continues] [Chihiro] Ooh. Thank you for this food. [gasps] Mmm... Mmm! [chuckling] Mmm! Mmm! Oh! [joyful music continues] [swallows] It's so sour. [laughing] Thank you for the delicious meal. [Bito] I watched her eat the whole thing, right down to the shrimp tail, and skin from the mackerel. I thought someone who showed such appreciation... ...couldn't be bad. Yes. That sounds like her. - Yeah. - [Tae] Mm-hmm. [chuckling lightly] [Nagai] Good morning. [Bito] Ah. Good morning. Ah, you're peeling chestnuts. Sorry, I wasn't here to help. - [laughing] What a shame. - [Nagai] Huh? - [Tae and Bito laughing] - Oh. [laughs] [Tae and Bito continue laughing] - [meowing] - [Bito] Good morning, kitty. You want something to eat? Just don't tell Ms. Nagai. [laughs] [continues meowing] [cows mooing] Here you go. Right here. Try not to eat my clothes. - [grunts] Good morning! - [cow mooing] There you go. - [cow mooing] - [Chihiro] Morning! There you go. [birds chirping] Have you gotten used to this yet? Yes. Have you ever done this kind of thing before? No, never. [farmer] Hmm... Well, you're learning fast. [Chihiro chuckling] So, uh... What were you doing before? I just worked in a bento shop. [farmer] Ah. A bento shop. Hmm. [upbeat music playing] [upbeat music continues] [upbeat music continues] [upbeat music continues] [music ends]
