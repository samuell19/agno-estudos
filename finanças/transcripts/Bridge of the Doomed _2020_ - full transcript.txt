Can you just stop talking? Hear that? Yeah, it sounds like a rabbit. Should try to shoot it. Rations are running low around here. [ominous music plays] [zombies growl] Oh, crap! [gunfire] [bitten soldier] Shit! [bitten soldier screams out] Sir, wish to report. - What's happening? - Sector C, sir. Just got a breach about one of those things - off the news. - How widespread? I don't know, sir. I only saw a handful. Want me to do a quick recon, sir? - Affirmative. - I'll go with you. [Vasquez] Go.

[indistinct] with four others, sir. Prepared to take back the camp. - Good man. - I hope he gets here in time. He will. I haven't been bitten, it's just a burn. Fine, leave it. We seem to be regaining control, sir. What levels casualties have we suffered? Many personnel were unable to access weapons. The enemy are moving so fast, most never stood a chance. How long until we regain control? Unsure, sir. But if you'll excuse me, I'll get back to just that. Of course, Lieutenant. [tense music plays] [man] It's clear. Come on. Come on. ♪ Oh, shit!

All citizens are to remain indoors. The military are on the streets. But initial reports say they are unable to maintain control. The military has advised everyone to barricade their home and stay inside. There's no need to go out to try and find guns or weapons to protect yourself. Emergency services are doing the best they can, but they are being overwhelmed by the sheer magnitude of the disaster. Ramifications of this situation stretched far beyond the current instability with the production of oil at a standstill. People have been setting fires in a desperate attempt at creating some form of barricade. This has been working, but the fires have spread. Just as the world has recovered from one virus, we now have to deal with another. A virus, unbelievably, that seems to be bringing the dead back to life. [Stahl] Can I have you look up? - Yeah. To the side. - [Vasquez] Attention! As you were. What's the status report, doctor? Well, as of right now, General, we're fine. 92% of surviving personnel suffered scratches, 62% serious cuts. Most, if not all, suffered possible infection of said wounds through hostile blood or saliva. So nearly all my soldiers could be infected? [Thornton] Could be, we're monitoring them. How you feeling, Corporal? I'm fine, sir. I wish I was back outside, though. I feel like I'm wasting my time here. Well, we need you back outside, but don't rush it. You aren't feeling any changes? Let's be honest, sir, I'm not sure how I should be feeling. This whole thing has left me feeling shook up. You'll get used to it. How's the burn? Healing well, sir. Nothing else, thankfully. Very good. It sounds like you'll be fine. Yes, sir, I'm sure I will be. - Sit tight for a minute. - Okay. If anything did occur, how fast would you expect it to happen? I'm not... Not entirely sure, sir. It's just new territory for us. We do know that in death... it's immediate. Deep bites, nearly as fast. However, with infection, we don't offer natural immune system to fight it off. And that's why I've had Captain Wahta brought in here. You think the taser's going to work? Taser will work. They ain't fully turned yet, then yes. Well, maybe. We got the mask we placed over their head the first sign of any trouble. Then we can place handcuffs, try to restrain them. Then what? Then we try to change 'em back. And if we can't... we may have to kill them. Very good, doctor. You keep me updated and check all exposed personnel every two hours. Yes, sir.

I'm sorry to disturb you, General, but I'd like to know what has happened to my husband? He remains unaccounted for at this moment, I'm afraid. The thought of him, out there, turned into one of those things. It's unlikely. What little information we have tells us they don't retreat, they just keep coming. So you think he might be alive? We are trying to ascertain his whereabouts, all we know for sure is that he hasn't turned. Sir, I'm reporting on camp security. - How's it going? - Good, sir. The barbed wire is back up. Every mine we have is forming an outer perimeter. Only clear way in is down the main road. What's to stop them from coming that way? Explosives, sir. We have them planted in the road [indistinct] points. They need to be detonated manually. Who's in charge of the explosives? That Norwegian civilian, sir. The one who came to teach that course. Right, when he's finished, tell him to report to Lieutenant Whitmore. - Yes, sir. - You are dismissed. [tense music plays] Morning, sir. Lieutenant Whitmore sends his apologies. - Is your team ready to leave? - Yes, sir. Lieutenant Whitmore would like me to submit a request for more supplies, sir. Sergeant, we gave you what can be spared. Reinforcements will be arriving in 48 hours. Thank you, sir. In the midst of chaos, there is also opportunity. God help us.

If you encounter any hostiles, do not engage. Understood? - Yes, sir. - Yes, sir. Go. The rest of you, I want filling those sandbags. I want a defensive position by nightfall. Sir. Is that all we got? It's what I was given. These cables and detonators are, like, ancient. Whatever happened to the ordinance - I was given for my course? - [Hernandez scoffs] They are probably planted around the camp's perimeter. This is what was left. Can you do this?

How many men have you brought with you? My driver. Colonel, my ranks were heavily depleted yesterday. I need the National Guard to assemble immediately. General, I understand. My communications are down. What men I do have are searching for what's left. I'm not even sure how many men are still alive, sir. Very well. What intelligence have you gathered? Little, unreliable and prone to rapid change. What's a safe zone today could be attacked - and change in an hour. - Understood. That's what happened to Northolt. 24 hours ago. Before that base was overrun, they made a report of a large number of hostiles heading their way. Sir, if Northolt was overrun, the enemy's ranks are likely much higher now. I'm assuming so. They were last seen heading south. Providing they don't change direction, they'll soon be hitting the river. The only way across is that bridge there. I'm sending Lieutenant Whitmore and his team to defend that bridge or blow if absolutely necessary. I'm relying on you to provide enough reinforcements. All due respect, sir, why not just blow the bridge straight away? Because, after this area's cleared, I plan on taking back this country piece by piece. I need all infrastructure intact. Understood, sir. Colonel, this has to be done quickly. - Godspeed. - Thank you, sir. Any update on the fuel search, sir? Nothing so far. And they keep on moving further and further out. We just have to get lucky, just one time. Well, how many times have we been unlucky, sir? That is none of your concern, Lieutenant, when they find gas, they'll bring it in. Have they tried siphoning it out of cars? My men have done everything apart from digging for oil. When they find it, they'll bring it in. I'm sorry, sir, but I really need that fuel. You and everybody else. I have the National Guard begging me for supplies. The National Guard? Well, then, how are they supposed to send reinforcements to the bridge?

What do you expect? We're running low on water. Well, maybe that's where I can help you. We've got plenty of water down by the river. You wanna go? - No, I'm okay. - You sure? Hey, you know, you can just leave her alone. Well, shit. Two of y'all. You gotta hygiene problem, woman. You don't smell too fine yourself. - Excuse me? - Hey, Sharrock, knock it off. Came here for supplies only. - Let's go. - That is supplies, brother. What did they want? Our food. Look, right now, everybody, we're all out for ourselves. If you give it to them, they're just gonna leave you. They're gonna drop you flat. So what are we going to do? Stick with family, all right? Shit, she's coming. Smells like cooking. So, is this the camp's kitchen? When we had food, it was. You can't go in there. Yeah, you think you can stop me? If you didn't have that gun, yeah. Look, I grew up with little boys like you getting all tough and pushing around girls. I'm sorry, you've been misinformed. You have no idea what I'm capable of. Move. You believe us now? You've got something somewhere. No, we haven't. It doesn't look like you're starving. Shit. [man coughing] No, it's okay. He's just sick. He looks infected to me. It's the fucking flu or something. You checked him for bites? No, I haven't checked him. Check him yourself. Sarge, that's not a good idea. I know. Look, if he dies, he'll turn. He'll bring all of you down. No, I'll be fine. [coughing] Deal with this. If anything goes wrong, this is on you. [Hernandez] So, that means I want everybody on half rations. Sanders, Lin, listen up. Half rations, no full apples anymore. Also, I want charges checked so make sure that you check with Eckland, I want everything intact. - Sanders? - Yeah. You'll be first going down to the river, collect water, bathe, do what you need to do. - We'll take turns doing that. - Okay. And then on duty tonight, Sharrock, it's you. Okay. [ominous music booming] [zombies growling] Go, go, go! Go! They're coming! Evacuate the bridge. Get ready to blow it! Move! Go! Go, go, go! - Come on, bitches. - It's not working.

Sharrock's got this. [Sharrock grunting] [zombie screeching] - Nice shooting, Lin. - Nice job. Although, that leaves us pretty low on ammo. [sighs] So Lin's out. What about the rest of you? One in the breech, Sarge. Okay, copy. Sharrock, ammunition report? Me too, one in the chamber. - Okay. - How about you? - I got enough. - What does that mean? - You gonna share? - Not right now. They're staying here with me. Oh, come on, Sarge, wouldn't it make more sense if we all had ammo? In case we get a surprise attack? They're staying right here. Hey, Sanders... do you think we should let Sarge, uh, torch the Humvees? No, no. Hey, look, you did good back there, kid. - Pretty good shooting. - Thanks. - But what now? - Well, who knows? Everybody just keep on walking and get the hell outta here, huh? So what happened with the charge? - [Eckland] I don't know. - You don't know? No, it could be the cable, it could be the detonator. - Shit. - They're all... Right. Okay. Here's what I want you to do. I want you to cut off the best piece of cable and rig it straight to the detonator. But... that would mean you would go up with it, too. It might not come to that. Do it! [muffled growling] [screaming] Eckland! Oh, shit, it's got him. - You three, guard the bridge. - Wait, what? Sarge, you don't want to do this. He has the last detonator. He's under my command. I will do the same for any of you. If he's still alive when you get there, - he won't be worth saving. - I'm doing this. Sarge, we've only got two rounds left here. - Take my gun... - No! ...and take my ammo, stop it. - I'm going. - [Sanders] This is a bad idea. - Sarge, no! - Yes, yes! Out of my way. - [Lin] [indistinct] - Sarge! [music fades] [crickets chirping] He's definitely on his way out. [sobbing] What are we gonna do? You know what's gonna happen - if he dies, right? - Want me to take care of him? Won't do it here. Take him out to the woods. Yeah, just leave him out in the woods. Snap his neck. Bury him real deep. What are you, a serial killer? I just work in an abattoir. You get used to it. What is this making us? It's making us survivors. - [ominous music stars] - [zombie growls] [man grunting] [man screaming] [meat squelching] [man 2] [indistinct] - Oh, my God! - [man] Just go! - [all screaming] - [zombie growling] [screaming] [Erin screaming] [music fades] [nature din] [tense music plays] Man, I don't know about y'all, but we need to get the fuck outta here.
