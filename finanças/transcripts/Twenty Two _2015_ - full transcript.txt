MOST OF THEM WERE TORTURED TO DEATH OR COMMITTED SUICIDE DUE TO THE UNBEARABLE HUMILIATION. ONLY VERY FEW SURVIVED. JINGUI VILLAGE, YU COUNTY, SHANXI PROVINCE Here was the so-called 'Comfort Station' It was secured by wire fences and trenches There were soldiers guarding the gate and women were held inside There were two caves in the front Liu Mianhuan and Feng Zhuangxiang used to be locked up there On the east side were three caves Where Li Xiumei and Zhang Xiaoni were kept On the south were four rooms Hou Dong'e and Chen Lintao were held there There were two brick beds in this cave. Both had women sleeping on them According to my research, more than 40 women were once held here Then the Japanese built strongholds in Shangshe, Xiyan and Hedong I've made surveys at all these locations Female victims were found at every place the Japanese occupied Having endured unbearable pain and distress, they long to pour it all out But obviously no one can share this kind of pain She would be so relieved if she could speak out But then there are those around her She bears such a heavy burden in her heart She is concerned for her children, so she dare not speak out Pian Huanying, born in 1928 Hao Juxiang（1922-2016） Ren Lan'e（1931-2016） Zhao Lanying (1925-2016) Liu Gailian, born in 1925 Liu Fenghai (1924-2017) She lives with her son and his wife. Cao Heimao, born in 1922 Grandma Where is her daughter? Where is your daughter? Do you know where your daughter is? Take one Don't be shy. What are you afraid of? I can't find her either, forget it Do you understand what she is saying? I'll go ask if you want to look for her daughter That's okay We can't understand what she's saying, can't communicate with her Can you call her daughter and see if she can come over? I can't find my pictures Will the pictures taken later still be the same? Is the picture ok? See if it looks the same This is my picture on my 'Good Citizen Certificate' See if you can take a photo of it So it's all inside there This must be very good It can take pictures of anything It must be very expensive I first met these grannies in 1995 AHN SE-HONG (SOUTH KOREA), PHOTOGRAPHER In South Korea, I met them for the first time I felt their pain. It was very unforgettable for me So I continued to pay attention to them And look for ways to help them I'm a photographer, so by that means I hope many people can see their situation and offer some help DONGNING COUNTY, MUDANJIANG CITY HEILONGJIANG PROVINCE I'm visiting mainly South Koreans and those of Korean ethnicity in China But it was not just Koreans who were among the victims There were also victims from Asia like the Philippines, China and Indonesia And even more countries and regions I know their pain is the same And many people are aware of their existence I personally hope that people can work together to solve this problem That's why I come to visit these grannies LI FENGYUN (1922-2016) ORIGINALLY NAMED LI SHOUDUAN, KOREAN Especially China It was the most invaded country And had a large number of victims Even now they are enduring great pain When I saw their living situation was so difficult I wanted more people to know about them as soon as possible But I've recently discovered their situation hasn't really improved So I'm thinking more about what kind of help they really need When I saw Grandma 'Park Cha Sun' was still living in a workshop-like place I wanted to transform it into a warm house By repairing the house for this elderly lady We wanted more people to know about her Then word spread by mouth We went to South Korea and Japan to run campaigns Telling people there exists such an old lady, and calling on more to help All 24 of us went to Xiaogan together to help repair her house We painted the house and rebuilt the walls Everyone there wanted to show their regard for her They wanted to give their most precious things to her So they prepared things such as Thermal underwear, scarves, and music and maps of South Korea XIAOGAN CITY, HUBEI PROVINCE Because my mother never gave birth to any child She thought about having children Her former neighbour told her she could adopt one, so she did I was only two years old at that time I heard from others that I was still breastfeeding back then My son has a family of four He's got one son and one daughter My grandkids Plus we three My husband, me, and my mother Seven in total She's had a very sad life She fled from South Korea to China, seeking refuge MAO YINMEI（1922-2017） ORIGINALLY NAMED PARK CHA SUN, KOREAN Mother (in Korean) Father (in Korean) Grandma (in Korean) South Korea is where I was born We didn't have any food to eat at that time So we fled My mother abandoned me, she just left me My sister was very young, she couldn't survive alone Mother held her and walked away She walked away just like that But she'd been missing me ever since My 'Ga Ga' is my grandmother You don't understand what I'm saying? Grandma is 'Ga Ga' (Hubei dialect) My Ga Ga looked for me everywhere If it wasn't for her, I would have been lost From then I stayed with my Ga Ga I didn't know how old I was I didn't know how old I was back then I just knew she was my mother She looked at me and I looked at her She didn't know what to do and father was already gone On one occasion She just went back, back to our home country That vehicle, the train It was on such a high slope and it just left I leaned against the slope and cried People up there were all looking at us Dropping food down to us I picked up the food and ate, and my mother cried I had no idea what was happening There was food and I just ate and ate Then I was tricked by a Korean He said the Japanese were going to start a sock factory Maybe it was July, in Hankou Where the Japanese stayed They had the Koreans and the Japanese, all locked up together There were doors, doors everywhere, and we were all locked up there Once locked inside, no one could get out We all stood up facing the wall, with guards at the entrance You couldn't escape, or they would beat you to death They took their time (playing with other women), they came one after another And they just left once they finished They did nothing (to me) They didn't care about us. They didn't even look at us Some things I remember, some I don't I remember some and then I forget some I'm done talking. I don't want to talk about it any more I don't feel comfortable talking about it My mother didn't tell me anything She said: "I'm too old so there's no need talking about it now." She didn't want to talk, so I didn't insist What more is there to say? HUANG MEIRONG MAO YINMEI'S ADOPTED DAUGHTER It's inappropriate for us juniors to talk about her More than 10 years ago A reporter came to interview her People were talking about her, so I knew But she never talked about it, never told me anything When reporters came to interview her, the neighbours became suspicious They said my mother was in the newspaper It was also broadcast on TV People were talking, saying she was a Korean That the Japanese did things to her, they insulted her My father never told me anything. He passed away 18 years ago He must have known about it long ago She just said "I'm so old, what more is there to say?" "What's in the past is in the past" Wuhan City, Hubei Province October 25th - 27th, 1938 ON NOVEMBER 8TH, 1938, THE FIRST PRISON FOR THE "COMFORT WOMEN" OPENED IN JI QING LI, HAN KOU. I can't remember I don't remember Miss Shiro (in Japanese) He used to call me "Miss Shiro" I didn't know what that meant "Welcome, please sit down" (in Japanese) It means sit down "Please come in" (in Japanese) It means come in, come up "Please come in" (in Japanese) "Welcome, please sit down" (in Japanese) It means sit down Some visitors came to see her in recent years They phoned to greet her About once a year A South Korean once called, asking to speak to 'Park Cha Sun' Why did he change her name to 'Park Cha Sun'? I said her name was 'Mao Yinmei' I named myself after Chairman Mao and I gave myself a first name too My former last name was Park I changed it to Mao, after Chairman Mao I love Chairman Mao He loved us and I love him Others said she was Japanese. I don't care where she came from She's very old now, she's good to me and I'm good to her, that's enough She raised me for all those years She was so nice to me I should take care of her now and repay her kindness She can't do any chores in winter. The cold always makes her curl up tight She just wants to walk around Her hands get so cold that she can't straighten them up. No blood in there She stays under her blankets when it gets too cold She doesn't want to go outside when she feels cold Only skin and bone, it gets cold here when there's wind She feels cold whenever there's wind She's always worried about being a burden to me, for living this long I'm useless Useless I have lived too long. I'm useless You can sing. How can you be useless? Don't you remember? When I was a kid, I had a good memory I could sing a song after listening to it just once Now I can't. I don't remember anything Arirang The song 'Arirang'. Have you heard it? Arirang, Arirang, Arariyo (Korean folk song) Arirang Pass is the long road you travel If you leave and forsake me, so cruel Ere three miles you go, homesick you'll grow Her lover left. She didn't want him to go, but he still left His feet started to hurt before he could walk far Arirang, Arirang, Arariyo Arirang Pass is the long road you go A South Korean asked her to go back home, to visit Korea She said she's too old.

Ai hey ai yo How beautiful, how lovely! Just one or two plants will fill the whole basket Lingshui Li Autonomous County, Hainan Province Chen Yabian（1927－2017） Ethnic Group: Li Baoting Li and Miao Autonomous County, Hainan Province I have been visiting them since 1996 Granny Huang Yufeng passed away in February 2003 The Japanese built a bridge connecting their stronghold in Jiamao to the town They built a road to their military camp in Baoting And forced local peasants to work for them Granny Huang Yufeng lived in the same village as those peasants She was a real beauty of the Li ethnic group The Japanese drooled over her They coaxed her to wash their clothes in their stronghold She was negatively regarded during the Cultural Revolution Some said she married a Japanese They said she was a traitor working for the Japanese Back then, these ladies were called 'Japanese whores' That was before they are referred to as 'Comfort Women' Huang Youliang, born in 1927 Ethnic Group: Li Chen Liancun, born in 1926 So every time I visited these ladies I always recorded their words very carefully FU MEIJU（1928－2017） I will follow their cases from the day I met them Until their last days We have filed a lawsuit against the Japanese government A claim for these 'Comfort Women' The phrase 'Comfort Women' is actually used only by the Japanese Not by we Chinese We use it only to identify these ladies in these matters Wang Zhifeng, born in 1928 We are actually supposed to call them "Victims who were forced into sexual slavery during World War II" Fu Guiying (1919-2015) Your husband went to Haikou Yes Home of Wang Yukai (1920-2014) I thought you would come to visit us a few days ago During the Dragon Boat Festival? I was a bit busy All cleaned up Whenever there's a festival, we come here Be it the Dragon Boat Festival or the Spring Festival You come to worship the gods during the Spring Festival too? I kept her photos here We were cooking outside the house yesterday Killing a chicken? Killing a chicken here We still cook her share of food but no one is here to eat now She was lying here sleeping that day She seemed like sleeping but actually she couldn't get up, very unwell My husband said: "How could she suddenly become like this?" He cried too How could she become like this all of a sudden? There's nothing we can do It looked like she was sleeping, just sleeping. She never woke up again Granny passed away on the morning of January 2, 2014 Her granddaughter told me on the Internet that she had passed away Her funeral was arranged too Granny is really gone You bought all of these things You bought all of these things for her but she hadn't used any I said: "So many people cared about you, yet you…" Not that many This is still new It's new I used to visit on weekends I visited Granny Wang more often About once a month She was the loneliest of all the seven grannies here She didn't have any family, so she lived by herself Most other grannies live with families Lingao County, Hainan Province It has been three years since this nursing home was built I manage this home LIANG CHAOSHENG DEPUTY MANAGER OF NANBAO NURSING HOME I open the gate in the morning, the big gate And I lock it at night These are security bars To prevent thieves from breaking windows to steal their belongings All the elderly people here come from the 'Five-Guarantee Households' They are either blind, disabled, or have no offspring She has been living here for three years She moved here right after this place was built She was the first one to move in Lin Ailan (1925-2015) When I was 13 I called on the villagers to supply our Communist troops with rice When I was 17 or 18, I began to follow the Communist Party And I fought battles along the path to Haikou City I killed two Japanese devils A machine gun The trigger was over here and I hung the gun around my neck I also held pistols, one in each of my hands I would load all the bullets, one by one With all the bullets loaded I just picked up the guns and fired shots at them I have a hole right here If that bullet had entered here, I would have died That bullet flew past here, just scraping my head Come, let's have a drink I don't drink We've got cigarettes I neither smoke nor drink, I just eat Go eat then, there's food That's fine. I've eaten already. I ate at home after class I had three scoops of rice at home, then I came directly here How big is your ladle? This big? About this size, not big That's too small. Ten scoops wouldn't be enough for me Three glasses of wine wouldn't be enough for me When I was teaching, she used to live behind the Nanbao Town Hall On my way home from school, I would pass by her front door She was in a very tough situation. No one was there to help her I would buy things, cook rice and fetch water for her That's how I came to know her I used to know a veteran who fought in the anti-Japanese war YAN XUEZHAN RETIRED TEACHER OF NANBAO TOWN He has passed away, but once he told me Lin Ailan made a great contribution To our party and to our people. How? After she infiltrated the Japanese camp He once told me She stole a lot of ammunition for our troops She snuck them out, one case after another She also called for others, especially young women, to join our army They've been filming for so long. They've got so many pictures They'll take the pictures to the government. I don't know Did I forget? I didn't. Am I a fool? I put them at the end of the bed I know the medals are put together with the money and the purse But they are not in the purse. I have no idea where they are They are taken They are not stolen. Here they are You said somebody stole these. Look, they are here! You put them here. It might have fallen off You accused Ahan of stealing and sent all those people to question him Where did you find them? I'd looked for them everywhere Inside the floral bag Where? Let me see Inside that floral bag You kept them there, of course you couldn't find them It should be placed like this But the other one is like this It's the same Well, leave it at that She joined the troops after they saved her That's why our Department of Civil Affairs awarded her these medals At the 60th anniversary of the victory of the anti-Japanese war The few of us girls We used to sing those songs Songs about fighting against the Japanese devils The cannons of the Japanese devils destroyed our homes They took my father and me, then in came more They took my father and mother, then took us too Our troops came to save me, saviors they are We will fight against the Japanese Oh so many songs like this, the Japanese would beat us if we sang As soon as the Japanese arrived, they destroyed our homes They seized my mother and killed her right away She was tossed into the river with her hands and feet all tied up They took my mother to that river in Jialai and tossed her there It was the Japanese who threw her into the river I was caught by the Japanese after I joined the army They threatened to kill everyone in Songmei Village They caught me, the three of us from the village. He forced me to marry him I said okay, but I just wanted to slash him I pretended to agree to marry him, then I retaliated against him later The government knows a lot about me That Japanese disabled me. Then he died too When she wakes up we bring her breakfast She sits there till noon, then slowly moves herself inside to take a nap She then sits by the door again in the afternoon Waiting for the carer to bring her dinner We deliver meals to three of them Others who can still walk fetch their meals from the canteen themselves It was mainly because of the torture that they couldn't have children They would strip you naked and force you to sleep with them Otherwise they would use tools on your mouth to torture you They would force you to sleep with them, or they would beat you up I was held there for nearly two years October to July, around two years, or less than two years I don't want to talk about these things Li Meijin, born in 1926 Chengmai County, Hainan Province My daughter is working in Haikou She has three kids, who are either studying or in the army They all give me money Sometimes I give them some too. I don't mind spending less on myself My kids are all grown up. I have grandchildren too My son would also bring me food My grandchildren take care of me too, so I feel very happy and secure I am very relaxed at home. I don't need to do anything When I run out of firewood for cooking, I'll just go get some It's been over 70 years. I can't remember it all I was still in my teens The Japanese devils came, shouting "Girls! So many girls!" They came to our village to take people away, then burned down our houses Many Japanese devils came, one group after another They made us pick wild fruit for them We had to climb trees to pick fruit, or they would stab us to death There was a bayonet at the end of the rifle With that sharp and pointy blade, the rifle became very long There were so many Japanese devils. They made loud noises when they ran Their boots were up to their knees and made such noises Back then I dare not sleep at home. I would sleep on the mountain I tied up my cows and sheep on the mountain too I dare not fall into a deep sleep. I had to watch the cows I hid in the tall woods. I dare not sleep at home We hid in the mountains but they would find you wherever you hid There were so many Japanese, too many to count We walked until we couldn't walk any more. The kids couldn't walk at all We walked until our legs hurt, then they hit our legs with their rifles My legs still hurt so much now because of that I can't even walk well now. It hurts every time I kneel down Those Japanese were very cruel They beat me all over my body. I was hurt everywhere They took everything, pigs, chicken, cows and sheep, and killed them all Then the Japanese devils caught me They took me to the airport in Jialai Once they caught you they would lock you up. Wouldn't you be terrified? I was scared to death. They would lock you up in that house My mother grabbed hold of my older sister She wouldn't let the Japanese take her away LI CAIYONG LI MEIJIN'S YOUNGER BROTHER He pushed my mother and she fell to the ground Then they took my sister away At night When you slept in that room, you could hear people screaming from rape When that Japanese touched me I would scream "Mum! Dad!", just scream The Japanese soldiers would rape any girl they could find, so vicious I once bumped into a couple and asked them to give me some water When the Japanese found out about this, they beat that man to death His wife wanted to take his body home He was already dead, so the Japanese let her I snuck into the funeral procession and hid among the mourners "You sister was taken away. How could she possibly return home?" "The Japanese must have killed her already." My mother said She then cried My mother and father thought I was dead When I made it back home, they were so happy and cried They couldn't hold back their tears, and told everyone "Our daughter is back!" The matchmaker said there was a young man living here, he had food My parents were very poor, they were worried I would starve to death My parents agreed to the marriage and wrote down my date of birth They gave that to my husband's family and we were married just like that When I came here, my husband was working and studying at the same time After I gave birth to my oldest daughter He stopped attending school My husband had a stroke when he was older He had the stroke after a bad fall. He couldn't eat so I fed him food slowly I would feed my husband food And help him wash his feet and body, and do everything for him I would also clean off his urine and feces He couldn't do anything any more. He could only eat a little I told him: "You have food to eat and clothes to wear." "And the government takes good care of me too. You don't need to worry." "It would be nice if you are well. If not, even if you can't walk any more," "And become disabled, I will take care of you." He is already gone But we had a good life together We never had a fight My big sister and I can't live without each other I always ask her to come here to eat and drink with us We'll let her do chores if she wants to. If not, we'll take care of her We'll ask her to come and eat whenever there's something good The government is nice, Chairman Mao was nice Chairman Mao was our leader, everyone knows him His pictures are put on the walls Everyone in our village has his pictures on their wall Li Ailian, born in 1928 Wuxiang County, Changzhi City, Shanxi Province Is your leg still hurting? It is better Did you take your pills? I took a painkiller Can you get off the bed? Yes. Is there anything I can't do? I'd been working as a substitute teacher from 1992 And I became a preschool teacher in 2009 I teach singing and dancing, and play games with the kids I read poetries to them, and sometimes I teach them Pinyin And some simple Chinese characters too My eldest sister is over 60 years old, she can't make the journey My older brother is too busy working to come here My second sister teaches in Taiyuan So it's just my husband, my child, my mother-in-law and me My mother-in-law is very straightforward LI XIUPING LI AILIAN'S DAUGHTER-IN-LAW She will tell you whatever she thinks, but never means any harm She has had a very troubled life I married my husband on Dec. 24th on the lunar calendar He was taken away the next February Others wanted me to remarry at that time I said: "I just married one. Why marry again?" "I won't do this. That's it." After the Japanese made me sign a pledge not to escape I stayed in the enemy's stronghold in Nangou People asked me, "How could you possibly make a living there?" I worked. I told them to find some work for me I made shoe soles. I would accept any work I also sewed with a sewing machine, things like that I could sustain myself Is the little one out playing? He went to his grandma's The Japanese there beat me as well I lived there for three months, how could I not get hurt? They would keep beating and insulting me till they were satisfied I didn't come back until the Japanese surrendered and left My husband said it's ok He said: "You can live whatever way you like." "You were taken and forced by the Japanese, it was against your will." I will speak of it no more, no more There were also villagers who judged her But most of those of her age have passed away The younger generation doesn't know much about it It was not until reporters came to interview them That some villagers started to understand Who were captured by the Japanese and what happened to them afterwards But they don't know any detail, nor do they have any thoughts about it Nowadays people don't talk about what happened years ago So my mother-in-law doesn't think about her past any more I shall not talk about it any more I didn't want to mention those things, but since you asked I do feel a little relieved to let out my feelings People say why bottle up those things till now I have not mentioned anything to my kids since I was 17 Others also know that I had stayed at the enemy's stronghold "Were you scared when you were there?" They often asked me this kind of questions I said: "Don't ask me about this any more." Many reporters came here, asking about those old days They came here a few times, but I lied to them. I did't want to tell them the truth My daughter-in-law and her little ones were all here listening My children are all grown up, what did they want me to say? I'll say no more. I'll take it to my grave. Speak of it no more Check out that yellow cat, the stray cat Whose cat is this? It is not ours, just another stray cat Hey! Where do you think you are going? That cat is having kittens Look at her belly. It's round The one with the black little paws? I don't know. I didn't see it A couple of days ago, I noticed its waist getting thick How come it is with kittens? It's around those two days How are we going to feed more kittens? Maybe it is our neighbour's cat. It gave birth to a litter of kittens Our neighbour doesn't look after them so they just came to our place At first there were five cats and my mother-in-law would feed them every day I said: "You don't even want to cook for yourself, now you are feeding cats!" She said they would die if nobody took care of them She would feed the cats even if she's not eating Sometimes when she cooks, she'll feed the cats first And she always gives the best part of her meals to the cats Kitty, come here Where are your babies? Why not bring them over? Wait for your babies They haven't eaten yet Take your time She comes outside when the kids are playing in the courtyard Those kids will surround her, calling her "Granny, Granny" They all play with her, very happy She will amuse the kids and sometimes cook them food to eat The kids love to spend time with her. They will sing and dance for her My mother-in-law is actually quite happy now But we can never imagine how she suffered Now my mother-in-law is in good health, we are all very happy Back then there was no such thing in my village But in other villages many women (who were raped) got pregnant They gave birth to kids with big noses and big eyes Those were kids of the Japanese Lipu County, Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region A journalist from a Beijing magazine How did you feel when you learned that you were half Japanese? My younger brother (half-brother) said I was Japanese LUO SHANXUE, BORN IN 1945 MIXED CHINESE/JAPANESE RACE He wanted to kill Japanese. He said he'd pay a killer He'd pay a killer to kill me. I just shut the door and told him "kill all then" Your brother said he was going to pay a killer to kill you? Why? Because I am Japanese Because of his mixed blood, 70-year-old Luo Shanxue has never married. Didn't Zhu Hong (volunteer) say he's going to find you a wife in Japan? Ridiculous Wei Shaolan, born in 1920 Ethnic Group: Yao He Yuzhen (1921-2014) When these elderly ladies have all departed this world one day This fact of history will remain Many people will still be asking What about their descendants? How are their families? Every time I meet them They all look so happy and carefree But as soon as this subject is brought up They become so sad and tears come down So we'll only ask them questions when it's necessary for the lawsuit If not, we'll just try to make them happy Chen Houzhi, farm worker When I was visiting Granny Wang Yukai I would do the cleaning, give her massages and fetch water for her If she washed her clothes, I would hang out the clothes to dry I didn't see her as a poor victim She was just like my own grandma, someone I like Some grannies are having a very hard time Some are not as sad as I imagined They are very warm They would let us eat and sleep in their houses, they cared about us When I was young, it was my grandma who took care of me and my little brother So I like grannies These grannies are very old, but they are all very adorable After some Japanese soldiers went back to Japan They told the public what they did. There's a book on it One day, Granny Wang's family showed her a picture of a Japanese soldier The Japanese man in the picture was very old, over 80 years old Granny looked at the picture and laughed She said: "That Japanese has become old, no mustache now." Because the Japanese soldiers of that time all seemed to have mustaches I thought she would cry or get angry when she saw the picture If it were me, I would probably always hate those who hurt me And even give up on life The wounds in their hearts are huge and deep But they are still being nice to others No matter we are from Japan or elsewhere Komeda Mai, international student from Japan Helping victims in Hainan Province since 2009 When I started investigating, there were 123 victims in Shanxi Province Now (2014) only 12 here are still alive I was very naive at that time and just wanted to bring them justice I wanted the Japanese government to apologize and to compensate them But in the end, after more than 30 years They didn't receive a single cent or any apology from the Japanese government They spoke out publicly about their past Which caused them disgrace Now all the people around them and even the entire country know about them It's not a good thing for them So I regret it very much If I had known it would turn out like this I would have never disturbed them ZHANG SHUANGBING, RETIRED TEACHER YU COUNTY, SHANXI PROVINCE ZHANG GAIXIANG (1925-2014) (The victims' names, including those who have since passed away) We would like to express our gratitude to every character in this documentary and their families for their trust and support According to the statistics of the China "Comfort Women" Issue Research Center Only 22 "Comfort Women" had survived in mainland China by 2014 The sun is rising, and the sky turns red WEI SHAOLAN (SURVIVOR, GUANGXI PROVINCE) "THANK YOU." - MAO YINMEI (SURVIVOR, HUBEI PROVINCE) "I'M HAPPY THAT YOU CAME TO VISIT ME." - LI MEIJIN (SURVIVOR, HAINAN PROVINCE) CHEN LINTAO (SURVIVOR, SHANXI PROVINCE)
