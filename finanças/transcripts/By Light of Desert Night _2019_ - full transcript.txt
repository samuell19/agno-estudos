-=Sync&Corrected by Misiek666=- Hey. Hey. - Diner looks closed. - Yeah. So I can't get anything good to eat here? Grilled cheese good? Anything else? Nothing else good. One grilled cheese then. And a Gatorade. Beth, chill. What's she doing in there? No idea, but quit molesting me with that noise. My wheel, my horn. Dick. - For real? I guess there's at least 21 years of experience in that face. Thanks for that. How long? T Minus 30 seconds? You into space rockets? Are you into medicine? Why? What have you got? Never mind. Heading to a party? Camping. Dressed for it. Have a good time. We already have drinks. Buried in the back. Food stink. Much needed hangover fuel. Punishment for staying out latest. You lightweight, it was your party. I had first drive this morning, but you had no excuse, April. You should have been carried out of that bar. I'm glad I went home when I did, okay? I'm just starting to feel human-ish. So, Suzy, baby, as bad as you're feeling, kick back, relax and enjoy the view while we drive your ass all over the place. Three weeks till the driving test, okay? Fourth time, lucky baby! Fuck off, baby! Jackie woke up and vommed, by the way. You got a signal? In and out. So we must be pretty far out then, right? Yup, and it's gonna be well worth the journey once you see the view. Do we have to wear these costumes the whole way? Do not be a killer of joy. I'm a traditionalist. Besides, it's only supposed to be the bride that wears the costume. Nothing about you is traditional, Suz. Yeah, and I'm wearing the badge as well, aren't I? False advertising. Well, maybe you should try it on, Suz, because I have a feeling it will fit you like a glove. Ouch. Speaking of sluts, you snuck off very quietly with Mr. Creepy Film Director guy? Okay. You have my full attention. He wasn't that creepy looking. What prompted this "delicit" little rendezvous? Well, as you know, Beth, beers and Jagger seem to make creepy look interesting. It has been known, yes. Plus, he kept saying I looked like Mia Wallace, which helps. From school? The clumsy chick who couldn't make cheer squad? No movie lover is our April. No, you ass. The babe from Pulp Fiction, Uma Thurman. How many girls with a bob have heard a line like that, I wonder? I don't have a bob. I know, I'm just saying I bet it's a very well used line. I can see it, actually. Jokes! - Bullshit! - -Bullshit! If you're not too busy back there, though, we'll hear the rest of that story please, thank you. Oh, my God! April, there's really not that much to tell. Well, knowing you, I'm sure he didn't go home completely empty handed. So? We parked outside under a tree by my house, made out. He successfully placed his fingers in my panties. I checked his fingernails first. Sufficiently clean. And then, yeah, he adequately completed the task... at hand. And then, I started to give him a hand too. Oh, stop. You're killing me, pornface. Unfortunately for him, the porch lights came on a little bit too soon. And I was out of the car and inside before he knew what was happening. Was a good thing too. My dad was coming out to see who was parked. Whatever happened to "I do you and you do me?" Shit happens, sweetie. Besides, he was better off not getting caught by Dad after an evening sponsored by Rittenhouse Rye. Can you imagine? That would have been pretty awful. All right. Don't get all weird, princess. Oi. "Oi"? "Oi"? You're not English. Poor guy. Thought his number had come up leaving with the high school cock-dog eating champion. Please. That tiny thing was no challenge. Okay, important part of the trip coming up. Halfway selfie stop. - For real, B? - -Yes, for real! We gotta record this trip for social media posterity. Oh, God! Well, be careful. The internet may actually break under the weight of such posterity. Laugh all you want, but in 20 years' time, when you can't fit in your skinny jeans anymore and you're fetching beers for your fat ass grumpy husband, you'll look back at these photos and you'll thank me. Wow. Another portion of bleak, please. You ladies are in charge. This weekend is all about saying farewell to my youth and hello to the rest of my life. I'm down. So, record it all. Make it count, bitches. Team player! There is always a chance she'll look back at these photos and blame us for letting her get hitched so damn young. No, don't start that yet. The boyfriend baiting show does not begin for at least another hour. Okay. As long as its planned. Why do we have to walk so damn high for a picture? This better be a damn good ass picture. How about that brown sandy backdrop? Oh, wait. How about that one... or that one? If we climb up that dune, we ought to get a good one with the angle of the light. Exactly how long have you been attending this evening class? You don't take a good photograph, you make one. Ah, Christmas cracker wisdom. Just get ready to pose. Beautiful day ain't it? Or a hell of a dream maybe? Wet dream. Monsoon. Locals on a charm offensive. You girls lost out here? Oh, no. We're good. Just enjoying the view. Sure is easy to get lost wandering about these dunes. We won't, don't worry. Photo taken, our friend sat in the car waiting for us, so no dramas. Ain't no drama. - Where you headed? - Oh, no. Hold on wait, enjoy the view a little more. Can I take your picture too? I could give you my confession, sister. She's the nun, asshole. Bitch. Oh, no, no way! Oh, please start! I'll be your friend. Time to go, April. Say cheese, motherfucker! No more pictures! Lovely meeting you, fellas. Catholic school must have been a bitch. Ain't no hiding in the desert. - These costumes have gotta go. - Beth, did you have to do that? Of course, she did. It would be no fun without some lunatics chasing us. - You know it. - -Are you okay, Suz? There's a time and a place for hair pulling, am I right? Clearly, you're fine, then. I'm calling this one "The portrait of a desert meth head." And its Insta-live. Am I the only one that's shook up here? We went to college in the deep south, honey. That was just first base. I can't see a car, so hopefully they aren't following. I saw a red truck parked a ways off. It'll take them ages to stumble off and get it if they do wanna play chase. Uh, that's not comforting at all. No more desert stops until the campsite now. In other news, this is a great photo of us. Ooh, let me see. Let me see. One sec. Hiding photos there, Beth? Abso-fucking-lutely. Oh, that is really cute. Can you send it to me? Suzy, honey, could you pass me my things? Just show April a photo of herself, and the crazy stalkers are instantly forgotten. Uh, like you're any different. Right. Oh, can you help me take this off then? What have you got on underneath? Stuff that's fine to drive in. Ooh... Ice pack? Chastity belt? Granny panties? None of which are fine to drive in. Trust me. Ah. And relax. RV park up ahead. - Beth? - -Ignore it. Keep going. Ignore the sign for the park we've arranged to stay at? Can you please explain? We're going wild camping. There's a spot in the desert where I always wanted to go and hike and camp. Just us and the stars, barbecue, beers. It's stunning I promise. Yeah, I mean, who needs running water? Or a bathroom. I packed toilet paper. And what about security in the middle of the freaking desert? Actually... - Beth! - Oh, my God! You brought it. - Why? I borrowed the one that dad the no G plays with the least. Oh, you're a G for sure, honey. A serious G. You had something to do with this, Suzy? I may have pointed out the inherent safety issues in desert camping and how best to mitigate them. Hush now. This is just in case. How many horror films start with a bunch of girls in the desert, right? Yeah, or an asshole with a gun. Hence why you're not touching it, honey. It's true, April. You can be quite an asshole. Well, sorry, sweetie. But if this is a horror movie, obviously I'll be getting slaughtered first. Oh, no. Okay, can you just keep your eyes on the road, bimbette? Ooh, whoo, whoo. Oh. Brought him along for the ride, then? Thank God he can't actually hear you. I'm not sure Ritchie would love you and your X-rated date stories. Oh, please. Filthy fucking football player. Oh, thanks, Suz. Oh, that's right. He was a virgin when he met you. He's a sweet man, is all you need to know. Mm-hmm, a sweet man who quarterbacked the football team through most of high school. And then again at college. - Don't go there, Suz. - -I'm just saying. I'm sure he barely gave the cheerleaders the time of day at state. Suzy! He's a man and, therefore, can never be trusted. - Don't marry him. - Don't marry him. He's disgusting. - Revolting. - Cut off his dick. Oh. - Too much. Hmm, you're right, the wedding's off. But we still get to party all weekend, right? Oh, definitely. But you return the gifts. Uh, I can live without three toasters. But not without us. What are the chances that we missed the turning already? Doubtful, but it was years ago that I was out here. So, we just keep driving then? As I recall, we'll see the rock around the time we reach the turning. So, no rock, no problems. Yet. Okay, and if we don't see the rock, then presumably you admit that we're lost and have fucked up on an epic scale? Not lost, girls, just scenic vibes. Wait, what about asking that guy? Would he know? He looks pretty local. An old boy like him is bound to know this state like the back of his hand. You mean on account of the fact that it used to belong to them? Basically, yeah. But let's maybe not have that conversation with him. Besides, who said he's a Native American? Oh, that's right. He's not wearing a Coachella headdress, so he can't be. Oh, my God! Not the Coachella thing again. Why isn't he moving? I guess we just go and ask him, right? Great idea. Okay, I guess I will go and ask him. God. I'm sorry to wake you, but do you have any... Come see my art. Um, actually, I just need directions to Ravens Rock, I don't know... How about I come see your art? This is a beautiful painting of the desert we're in right now. Yeah, it's lovely, but I don't need any art, I'm afraid. And who told you that? Well, no-one, but, I... Um... Where are you headed to, mademoiselle? Actually, you should ask our guide that. Uh, Beth! Hello. Do you know how to get to Raven Rock? Come to catch a raven? Uh, no. Raven Rock. A good place for answers. Assuming you got a question. And hopefully, a good place to camp, I'm told. Good friends? Yeah, why? Friendship can be as blind as love, but the raven can illuminate the truth among the lies. It brings changes, both wanted and unwanted. The raven can take many forms. Perhaps you're the raven. No. Dude, I'm not the raven. You. Let me have your hand for a moment. - April. - Shh. I have a painting for you, mademoiselle. I really don't want any pictures, sir. But a map? One that your guide can follow to Raven Rock, just as you had asked. Not quite G Maps is it? We are here. It's there, and the road runs this way. Thank you. Ten bucks. Oh. Of course. Good sale. Good value. Good luck. That was intense. Is the map really making sense, Beth? Kinda. But we'll know soon enough. Good, 'cause I am fucking bored of sitting in this tin can. My ass hurts. I need to stretch out. Shut up, backseat. Oh, backseat, what's up with you? Can I just see the map? Be careful with that, though. It's a nice souvenir. The only thing I want to know is why the fuck am I the raven? Okay, see that way up there? Yeah. Is that the rock? Jesus, as if we could miss that. Okay, well, next time you say 30, I'll know to double it. Ladies and bitches, I give you Smoke Creek State Park and Raven Rock. Now tell me it wasn't worth the extra drive. Well, I have to say freaking yes, baby. This is stunning. Where are all the ravens? Enough with the ravens. Are we actually in a reservation right now? Maybe close to. Otherwise, he wouldn't have made such a big deal about the place. They say the whole area is pretty mystical, etcetera, etcetera. Wow, they do? Oh, yeah. Lots of stories and stuff. I have to admit, I don't know anything about it. Neither do I. Oh, yeah, this whole area is literally littered with graves and stuff, stories about peeps seeing things here that go way back. Graves? Oh, no, come on, you guys, please tell me we are not here on some sort of ghost hunt. Come on. It's not for a bachelorette party. A dumbass bachelor party maybe, but... - April? - -What? How's your leg? What? Why? I don't know, Beth is yanking on it really hard. Are you serious? Honey, you should see your face. This place is known for pretty rocks and sweet nothing else as far as I know. So let's get ready to camp, so we can hike up for the view, and be back in time for a feast at sunset. Oh, God! Please, let's stretch first, you sadist. If you're gonna do it, do it. But you're not getting out of any unpacking. Wait for me, you bitches. That's the last of it. Comfy, Suz? Just rinsing off your beer. I propose we catch the last of the sun. Okay, don't get too comfortable. I second it. We haven't even set up properly yet. Let's just take a quick moment of relaxation. Come on, Beth, it's my party. Okay, fine, but I'm not doing it on my own. Tunes on, please. Okay, fine. Chill. I have to charge my phone soon, anyway. Oh, good, difficult jazz. Maybe you are the raven. Shh. Okay, girls, so, in high school our goal was to go to college, which we've already done now. Woo-hoo! We've barely had any time since we've been back to catch up and hang out just the three of us. So, Ape, what's the next move? Ape! Ha-ha. Don't fucking call me that again, Floozy! Okay, okay. Come on. Well, shit, sweetie, if you recall, I am getting married in a minute. So it's kind of taken up all my time since I got back. And then it's all baking and babies for you. Yeah, for sure, as soon as possible. No, okay. Well, not right away, right? You just spent all that time studying. I'm sure you wanna use it for something. Well, yeah, but, I mean, there's not a ton of journalism jobs back home, so I might have to think exactly how I wanna use my degree. Yeah, well, you're not planning to stay back there, anyway. Bright lights, big city, remember? Yeah, but Ritchie and I have talked about it and he and my mom agree that maybe running away straight off is not the right call. Here it comes. Here what comes? Ritchie and your mom agree? Babe, Ritchie and your mom don't need to be planning life for you. I have a say in it too, girls. Does Ritchie's job with his dad have anything to do with it? Oh, come on, we would be dumb to turn that down. Ah, Ritchie, good guy, but he wasn't gonna go anywhere far from home with a job for life dangled in front of him. Wow. I didn't realize the two of you thought so highly of my fiancé. Honestly, girls, it's a well-paid job, and he'll probably end up running the company one day. Do any of us have a good an offer as that on the table? Huh? Actually... I have some job news I was saving up. Well, come on, missy, let's hear it. I was up for a kinesiologist assistant position... - Yes? - -Yes? For a team... - Yes. - -Yes. I wasn't sure I was gonna get it... Jesus, Beth, just spit it out. I was on the card, y'all! - Oh, my God! That's amazing. - I know. It's so junior, but the coach is a huge track fan and he knows me from my stuff in college, so they were really keen to give me a shot. - Wait, so does that mean... - No. Yup, I'm moving to Glendale. You're moving? Well, the job doesn't come with free chopper rides, honey, so yes, I gotta go. But what about the Phys Ed job back here then? Jacked it! I gotta get the fuck out of the village and up close and personal with some pro-football torso! I'm just kidding about the village, honey. But just remember, don't settle for anything less than what you want. I know. I know. And you know that I'm happy for you, you little shit. Can I give you one piece of advice? Of course. Try not to do the entire team in the first week. Just space it out a bit, please. Understanding your college strategy a bit more now, Suz. It's all juice for the book after all. Oh, my God! How far have you got with it now? Oh, yeah, when is The Twerker in the Rye hitting the bookshelves? Uh, The Trasher in the Rye. Do The Nasty in the Rye. Okay, okay. All are better titles than What I really learned in College by Suzy Fisher Copyright! No, I reckon I'm about three quarters in. I'm just thinking about adding a "what it was like coming home" bit. Starring us. Well, obvs. It's always about you. Well, I can't wait to read it, babe, so hurry the fuck up. Me neither. Knowing you, it'll be pretty X-rated! So, in that case, I suggest... that we toast to some pretty good shit that we got going on. To us, ladies. Nothing more, nothing less. Ooh! What is going on? Girls, wake up, the lights have gone out. Solar ones don't last the whole night. Go back to sleep. There was a noise, I think. Suzy, did you hear it? Until I need to pee, I don't care. Then I'll just pee on you, prom queen. Okay, fine. If you're not worrying, then I won't either. Something's here with us. - Beth! - -I heard it, shush. Okay, fuckface, We are gonna... Who's out there? Listen, this isn't funny anymore, okay? So, why don't you and your friend just... Hey, you ever seen what a 9mm pistol will do to an assholes face? Fuck off! I will shoot you. Ah, something's touching me. Stop it. It's just me, okay? Stay close. You okay? Just stay close. What's happening? Quiet, something's moving. Ah, something just hit me. I warned you, don't come close. Oh, my God! Something just fucking hit me, and now my ears are ringing. What the fuck? Here are all the missing lights, very funny. Throw some around, so we can see who's still out here. Just assholes trying to scare us. I'm way past scared, okay? If I wasn't half drunk right now, I'd be fucking freaking out. They were just pulling a shitty prank on us. Then why fire a gun, Beth? It was just a warning shot. Shush and listen. What are they doing? I think they're by where we parked now. Yes, I locked it, before you ask. We scared the shit out of them. And out of me a little bit too. Yeah, and me too, a lot. I'll kick your ass if you come back! If only they could hear you, I'm sure they'd be scared shitless. Yeah, or they might actually come back. Let's avoid that. If they wanted to do anything serious, they would, right? Let's just all relax. And since we went to the trouble of unpacking a tent, let's just sleep in it. As opposed to just leaving? Quickly? There's no way that I can go back to sleep. I'm sure those idiots realized it's bedtime and gone for good. Besides, it's gonna be light soon anyway, we can stay awake. Tomorrow we'll switch camp just to be sure. But do we even wanna be inside a camp? We can't see what's outside. We only have to watch the entrance this way. I'm still a bit drunk. I'm still on edge. There's sleeping tablets in my bag, but you have to get them. My real deal baby blues. I'll manage, thanks. They'll knock you out. I'm not going to sleep. - Me neither. - Me neither. Your face is hot. It's too early for flirting. No. I mean, it's like 150 degrees in here. Good morning to you too. I can see we all kept watch diligently. Is Action Jackson still on duty? Yes. No. I don't know. I think I maybe got an hour's sleep. Same. I'm fried. I can't actually fucking breathe in here. You would think with such discomfort it would force us out of bed. Plus, I know Beth must be hungry. Beth, is your stomach rumbling yet? It is, isn't it? Beth? Beth! Fuck. I fold. Let me out. An athlete's weakness is her stomach. I'm starved. I know. I'll help get some eggs on the go. Uh, start with coffee if you'd like to avert homicide. Start with food, or I go cannibal. That was definitely coming from where we parked. Is that them again? Third time lucky. What do you mean third? Yeah, they passed us on the road after we got the map. Same truck, anyway. While we were buying the map, right? No. After that. A little way down from that artist guy. Maybe its four, then. A car like that passed us while we were paying. These guys have stalked us four times now? Jesus, you guys! Why didn't either of you speak up? I just didn't wanna worry everyone when I wasn't sure. Oh, cool. Great, thanks. Thank you so much for bringing me into the middle of nowhere for safety. If it's okay with you, I'd like to not stay out here a second longer with these fucking crazies stalking us. Let's pack up our shit, please, and maybe try the actual campsite, okay? - Maybe you're right. - No, no, no. No more maybes. My party, my call. Let's pack up now, please, and lets... - Look at the wheel. - What? No way. Ritchie checked the whole car over before we left. Oh, my God! The caps are gone. It must have been those guys. - Tell me you have a spare. - Of course I have a spare. I'm not an idiot. How about two spares? - What? - -Same deal. Real jokers. Oh, my God! I'm gonna have to call someone out here. No signal. Ditto. It's charging at the camp, but don't get your hopes up. So are you saying we're gonna have to walk out of here? We cannot stay here another night. I hope we don't have to, but it's better than walking around here all night. It's about 40 miles just to the main road. A dawn start, for sure. Besides, if those idiots do decide to come back again, another little warning shot will probably scare them off. Yeah, or maybe they'll just fucking shoot back. - Not helping, Suz. - -I'm not trying to. This is really bad. Oh, my God! What are we gonna do? Calm down, Ape. - Don't fucking call me Ape! - Okay, okay. Let's just all wait and see if I have a signal before we get completely freaked out, okay? Fine. Come on. I'm sorry, I shouted. It's all right. Don't worry. It's all right. Dumb bitch. Don't worry, those guys are not gonna come back. We're gonna get signal, we're just gonna get out of here. We'll be okay. Don't worry. I can't. I have to go pee. Hey, cowgirl. You left a present for our friends. Stick it on the cooler, Suz. April! No, no, no, Beth. Beth, Beth. Give me my phone, we need to call 911. Keep your hand on this. Keep your hand on this. Give me my phone! Give me my fucking phone! - But the phones don't work. - I don't know. I still don't have any fucking signal. - April, what did I do? - You shot her, Suzy! Come on, come on, Beth. Come on, baby. It was an accident. I just killed her. Keep your hand like this. Beth! Wake up, wake up! Oh, my God, I'm gonna go to prison. I'm gonna go to prison, April. They're gonna send me to prison. April, April. - April! - What? She's dead! I don't know, okay? She's fucking dead, she's dead! What do you want me to tell you? Come on. It was an accident. Beth! I think we should hike up high and get a signal. I mean, we can't just sit here like this. In the movies, when somebody dies in the desert, the vultures come. I thought you were gonna cover her. Suzy, come on. Come on. Let's do it. Okay, do you wanna go get changed? Yeah. Oh, my God, it's Beth's phone, it has signal! April, are you calling 911? April, what is it? It's a message from Ritchie. Your fiancé, Ritchie? Yeah, my Ritchie. What is he messaging her about? Um, he said, uh... April, what did he say? "Hey, sexy. I hope the cheerleaders haven't bored you to death yet. I don't know about you, but every now and then just isn't enough." He was seeing Beth. - No. - Hey, look at me. Are you okay? Mm-hmm. No. I feel dizzy. April. April. April? April. April. Come on, April. Come on. - April? April? - April. You're waterboarding me. Whoa. Come here. Hey. It was his fault. How could he do that to us? Okay, it's just so typical. Yeah, but she wasn't typical, though, was she? Are you thinking about the wedding? Hmm? No. I don't see how that can happen now, right? I mean, that's not at all what I'm thinking about. Can our lives be like more of a royally fucked-up mess right now, a full-on fucking nightmare? God, she's fucking your fiancé, and I fucking killed her. Then we found out what she'd did to you. Yeah, I didn't know at the time, of course. Yeah, all because she brought a gun to a fucking bachelorette party, all of this had to happen. I have got to be about to wake up. You know, I don't even know what your parents are gonna hate more. The fact that their little society wedding is getting binned or their daughter being part of a homicide thanks to that awful, awful Suzy. Oh, my God! Stop. My head can't take this right now. I'm just going... I'm just going to jail. I'm going to jail because everyone's fucking everyone else. Fuck, and I was a bit careless. I was a bit careless, yes. - Suzy... - I just wanna know. I wonder why she brought it, okay? Was it for you? Is this why we are in the middle of fucking nowhere? What? Okay, I wonder if she would have minded if you got shot instead? What do you mean? - She wanted what's yours, right? - Oh, my God! Suzy, you can't fucking think like that. I can't think that. I can't think at all right now, okay? Nothing. This is all just too much. Okay, it was an accident. It was an accident, okay? And now, they're going to take me away from you as well. Ritchie, Beth, and me. - I can't deal with that. - Which bit, April? Losing everything, everyone. It could be worse. Worse how? Hmm? Motive. What? Like some plan? I mean, think about it. Once they realize that she was seeing your fiancé, they're gonna automatically assume that it wasn't an accident at all. Do you see how that looks? Oh, my God. Oh, my God, it looks awful. So... So... So... So instead of you getting blamed for an accident, we're both getting blamed for a murder? No. No, fucking way, Suzy. I'm a victim here just as much as she is. April, I don't wanna to go to prison. We're the only ones that saw what happened. So? So we'll make something up. We don't need to make anything up. It was an accident. I'll still go to jail! But maybe there was another way that this happened. What? And say what? Lie? She shot herself in the chest? I don't think that's very likely. I don't know, April! I wasn't planning on this, okay? Just let me think. Maybe we... maybe we didn't see what happened. What? Maybe we didn't see what happened? What, maybe we didn't see her get shot? Yeah, maybe. Maybe nobody shot her. - Somebody definitely shot her. - No, no, no. Maybe she went hiking and never came back. I don't follow. What... what if we were too hungover to go with her and she went without us? Well, I mean, she would have gone whether we went or not, you know what she's like. And because she has a phone, she would have posted photos to prove it, right? Right, but, I mean, Suzy... Yeah, I know. We're gonna have to hide the body. What? Fuck off, Suzy. No. That is not what I was gonna say. Oh, my God! Your mind is going to places I can't even comprehend right now. Do you even hear yourself? Huh? They were cheating on you. For God knows how long. Maybe it's just karma, right? - Do you want to go to jail? - -No. No, I don't wanna go to jail. Okay, fine. You're right. Yes. That would be the next step, okay? Hiding her body hadn't even occurred to me. - Oh, my God, Suzy! - -What? You missed a bit. Seriously? - Yeah. - -Ah. It's a shame I'm not wearing my nurse costume. Nobody would have questioned me. Okay, that was a really bad joke, I'm sorry. Let's just go take some fucking photos, okay? I guess we are doing that fucking damn hike after all, hey? - April? - -Yeah? How long do you think it's been going on? I'm trying not to think about that. We could look at the messages. See how far back they go? I have nearly 20 years of memories of the two of them. Ten years in a real relationship with Ritchie. I need to protect some of those memories. Because if I imagine that they've been smiling at me all this time and just twisting and twisting a knife right in my back, it kinda makes me sick. I mean, if you had any doubts about what we're doing, then maybe knowing how long... It'll just feel cold. Or detached maybe. I don't know, it's weird. What's wrong? Nothing, nothing. This place... What about it? I just... I just don't feel right. Look, do you wanna read this or not? Yeah. Yeah, maybe I should. But maybe you shouldn't. Um... I'm finding it really easy to hate their guts. Never mind. Don't read it. No? It's not healthy. - Are you sure? - Yes. Okay. Your face says enough. What doesn't kill you makes you stronger, right? Hmm. Then we should have super powers or something. Let's just keep going then. Yeah. Wow, she was right. It is spectacular. It's kinda poetic. Everything we've been through, now that we're at the top, we're just gonna leave it all behind us. Quite the analogy. That's me. No. No, it's not. All right, let me take a few photos then. Tag it. "What a shame the others are missing out." Then everybody will think that we stayed behind. Oh, my God! So dark. - But yeah, I guess, okay. - I can write it. No, it's okay. I've already started. Oh, shit, wow, she really did post that picture of those desert dudes. Lots of comments here from friends about being careful out here. Maybe those guys will get the blame? Can you imagine? April, what is it? Here, you write it. Are we doing the right thing, Suz? I mean, I know it's not the right thing, but are we doing it for the right reasons? I just wonder who else knows that he was seeing her? Who else is gonna wonder if we did this on purpose? Even if the cops believe us or not, this is gonna stick. But if I can save you from being punished for an accident, then I gotta do it, right? I mean, you didn't really wanna kill Beth, did you? All the time. That's not funny. Thank you for doing this for me. Well, either you go to jail for an accident, or we're both suspects for shooting my fiancé's mistress. Some choice. Just do it. Okay. Posted it. I guess we should turn off the phone now. Wait, wait, wait. Are you sure I shouldn't read the messages first? Just let me do you a favor, okay? Oh. Friends forever, April. You said it. So there's only one thing left to do. Yup. We just, uh... We can't hide her here. We have to do it somewhere that's away from camp. No, I'm gonna need a drink or two first. I feel weird about touching her. Hmm, really? 'Cause I'm completely fine dragging around the dead girl you shot. - April! - Well, what do you want? Of course, it's gonna be weird. Have you ever even seen a dead body? She's not cold like I thought she'd be. She is dead, right? Oh. Okay. Just please don't let me do this by myself. No, I'm gonna help. Okay, ready? Boy! She's heavy! Okay, well we have to try a lot harder than that. - I am trying. - Well, try harder. Otherwise, she's not gonna go anywhere. - All right, chill. - Go. You're still digging, though. Well, somebody's got to. We should burn any clothes that have blood on them. Yeah, of course. Accessorizing, April? Oh. No, but we do have to spend the night here. So I wanna make sure I keep it close. Let's put her in. Farewell to 15 years of friendship. Good riddance. You say that pretty easily, Suz. I read the messages, April. She had a few opinions about me as well. - Like what? - Nothing I wanna talk about. Is there something you're not telling me? Whatever, let's just cover her, okay? Three stuck up little princesses came to enjoy the view. But their gun went bang, and then there were two. Fuck. Told you she wasn't gonna be much for foreplay, didn't I, Wally? But a fuck seems only fair in exchange for us to keep your dirty little secret. Not worth it. It's us, or a whole lot of us. You may recall meeting the boys last night. They were quite taken with the buffet. You sicko. So you'll play nice, or there's gonna be a lot more guests. Now, can you keep a secret, blondie? Please, please don't touch me. The word "please" can be quite a turn on when you hear it over and over again. Eli! I do believe she's jealous. Back over to that fucking hole. Wally, what's my first rule of double dates? Stake a clear claim and stick to it. Now, why haven't you got your claim under control? I said, back the fuck... The fuck I will. Then I'll fucking drag you then. Suzy! First, I'm gonna choke you. Hey. Get off her. Are you okay? Are you okay? - Are you okay? - Are you okay? - April. He'll either report us, or they'll come back when we're sleeping. April! Go. Go. April, don't let them get away! April! Two more dead people. They would have killed us. You saved us. When you killed them, I mean. Maybe. You did too. It was both of us. When do we report her missing? We'll have to start walking somewhere in the morning, somewhere where we can call 911. If he just wanted to be with her, then why not just end it with me? I don't know, April. But his waspy parents were never going approve of him marrying anyone like me or her, though. Or you? You know what I mean. Oh, come on. Don't be naive, Ape. Perfect, popular, prom queen April? Never puts a foot wrong. Well-to-do parents... good grades, studies hard... still with her high-school sweetheart. Okay, you're gonna make a great soccer-mom one day. - Suzy... - I mean, the cheer squad gave me some pseudo-validation, and Beth's athletics for sure, but who wants parents like mine, and their love of a bottle? Or my asshole, delinquent brother, who would steal anything just to get loaded. Why are you sounding like such a fucking victim? Oh, don't worry. I don't feel like one. Sweet pea. It's life. The way it is for some of us. You just gotta to do that bit of extra to get what you want. So what? Huh? You want me to be ashamed of my background? Trust me, my life is not some fucking fairy tale, okay? I have my own issues to deal with. Okay. What's the hardest thing you ever had to deal with? Oh, you know what? Shut up. I know my problems may not seem so much to you, but trust me, they exist, okay? You see your family as useless, but I see you as having more freedom than I've ever felt. I'm second guessed, extra analyzed, overruled all the fucking time by my mom. "Is this a suitable thing for a Jones' daughter to be doing? What will people think? What will we take away from her if she doesn't comply?" My upbringing has left me pathetically terrified to live my own life at risk of losing the gilded, shiny, comfortable existence I know. - Poor fucking you. And because I'm so shamefully afraid of that, I do exactly what they want every single fucking time. I don't know, maybe that's why I'm with Ritchie, in a way. He comes from money. I won't have to rely on my parents for anything anymore. You mean you don't even love him. Of course, I love him. But sometimes I think I may need him a little more than I love him. For the record... having drunk parents does not represent freedom in any way, you fucking asshole. I'm sorry. That's not what I meant, and you know that. It's just hard to explain. Ditch him. And the family. And get on with your life. I wonder if I'd be better just never going back and just drive straight on past it. But then he gets away with everything. All the sympathy. Poor Ritchie, his fiancée left him. And that's just not right. Well, what can we do about that? Nothing, right now. Just stay away, but wow, I'd really like some payback. Payback? Now, that doesn't sound like Princess April. Oh, forget it. How are you feeling? I don't know. Somehow, I feel like everything was supposed to happen. Well, that's just crazy. I'm not crazy. I didn't say you were. I'm just glad I still have you at least. I don't know where my head would be right now without you. Maybe go a little bit insane. Tsk, feel like I have already. How is it not the right thing to say the truth? Just be honest. I know. April. Huh? Sorry, yeah. No. Of course I'm not gonna say anything. I'm so tired, I can't even think straight. Just keeping me out here in this desert when I have to get back? Because my boyfriend is waiting for me. My Ritchie is coming to get me. I called him to come pick me up. I just had to climb up the rock a little bit, and then bingo, signal. When he gets here, we can work everything out. And I can forgive him about her, about Beth. Fucking Beth. She knew I liked him. She knew it, and now look what happened. Look what happened. I just have to do that bit of extra to get what I fucking want. I don't know what happened to the other girls. They went looking for help with the car, and the desert's just so goddamn big. You know, it's so easy to get lost in. Beth said so herself. She warned us. And they never came back. It's so noisy. The desert's supposed to be peaceful. You're not gonna be that much help at all, are you? What the fuck? What the fuck? Hey, Ritchie, is that your girlfriend's car? Yeah, that's it. Suzy! Suzy! I'm here! It's okay, it's okay. It's me. It's okay. Oh, God. Miss Suzy, are you unharmed? Yeah, but I'm freaking out. They've been gone a really long time. And I wouldn't have stayed here the whole night if I knew I'd have to be alone. Well, Ritchie here told us about your car's tire and, uh, the men. Right. The red truck. Um... That's why we're stuck here. But you saw them? Not here. We saw the truck here. We saw them before on the way here. Twice at least. Same guys? No, the same truck. So we automatically assumed the same guys. We didn't pass anyone along the road on the way up, ma'am. Is that the direction your friends took? N... No. Beth said it would be quicker to cut across in that direction. Okay, just come over here and have a seat. I need you to start from the beginning, okay? Okay. They just kept walking until I couldn't see them anymore. Okay. Thank you, miss. Start packing up the girl's car. I'm gonna get on the horn and call Search and Rescue, get them to put a bird up, get this escalated. In the meantime, we need to get an APB out on that truck. She's in shock. We need to get her comfortable and over to EMT. I'll get started. Okay, I'm gonna need any and every detail you can give me about that vehicle. And then I promise we'll get you out of here, all right? Unit 31, be advised. Search and Rescue will commence in 30 minutes, and an EMT unit is in-bound. Over. Copy 10-4. Inform EMT that we're headed in their direction and that we're in RV on route. 10-4 31. Romero. Help! Help! Oh, come on! I got her. Hit the horn. Hit the horn. Let her know we're coming. Stay back. That's April. April? Yes. Her hands and feet are bound. They could be in the vicinity. April, who tied you up? April, who tied your hands? She did. Say that again, April. She killed Beth and she buried me alive. Drop the gun, Miss Fisher. Ritchie, please don't let them take me. Suzy, what are you doing? Drop the gun and we'll sort all this out. Put the gun down. Put the gun down right now, Miss Fisher. - Turn around. April, April, what's going on? So I didn't make the connection on the drive up, but yeah, I watched all your games. Could have sworn you'd go pro. Nah, I had a couple injuries I just couldn't come back from. All done and dusted, unfortunately. But I bet you had fun while it lasted. Ladies love a quarterback, right? Yeah, they do. So you're positive you have no idea who the mystery man is? No. Beth's exact words were, "It's no one you know." And you never heard neither one of them mention his name? I literally found out when they began to argue. I don't know. Must be the first time they keep a secret from me. That secret turned into an argument, which escalated into a shooting. Apparently, this guy is worth killing over. I've yet to meet one of those myself. Tell me again about the two men. They just saw her pointing the gun at me while I was digging the hole. They didn't say anything? There were no introductions? No. It was just shouting at us, at her to put the gun down and stuff. But like I said, she just saw their gun and shot at them. I can't really blame her for that. They looked pretty crazy, and we knew they were trouble since the first run in. Okay. Look, we're gonna get you to the station and get you looked at, um, but we're gonna need some more details. Yeah, of course. I understand. I'll help any way I can. Well, it looks like your ride's almost ready. Hang tight a minute. April. I don't talk to strangers. April, I didn't plan for all of this. I was sure you were going to blame me, so I freaked. Are you still trying to manipulate me? Murderer. Huh? Yeah, I'm not buying the accidental gunshot anymore. How long have you been fucking my fiancé, by the way? Why haven't you mentioned that to the cops? All the reasons you said he chose me over Beth, you were talking about yourself weren't you? God, I don't understand you, Suzy. After all the things we've always thought about guys, why would you ever want one that's prepared to treat a girl the way Ritchie's treated me, huh? Do you still want him? Not for long. And if you want him too, you can forget about him, unless you're looking for a prison pen-pal, babe. I don't want him. He's lied to me, lied to you, probably lied to Beth. Besides, he chose you. He chose me all along, you idiot. He needs me just as much as I need him. The dream wedding to the fucking prom queen meant his parents were gonna give us a pretty generous start in life. He's shallow, but not completely stupid. And his parents love golden girl April, remember? They're just as stuck up as mine. So what happens now? Right now, we stop communicating, ladies. Hey, is there something that you wanna tell me right now? No, you understand about as much as I do, officer. Officer Barnes, can we get going? You have a great ending for your book now, Suzy. Let's just go. - That took a while. - Yeah. Are you okay? Yeah, I'm fine. Any news on Suzy? She won't say a word, apparently. - Hmm. - Can we go, please? I can't keep my eyes open. Yeah. Yeah. How long have I been asleep? You crashed out as soon as we hit the highway. A few hours. How are you feeling? Fine. I was hoping you'd wake up so we could talk. Suzy sounded pretty crazy when she called me. She was saying some... uh, some ridiculous things about me and her. Like what? She didn't say anything to you? - No-uh. - -April. I don't really feel like talking right now, Ritchie. Well, when then? Um, there should be a gas station up ahead soon. - Pull in, will you? - -What do you need? I need to make a call. - What's wrong with your phone? - Dead. So use mine, its right here. And I'm thirsty. And I need the restroom. Who do you need to call, you can't speak to in front of me? Sweetie, just pull the fucking car over, okay? Suit yourself. I'm thirsty too. Mom? Hey, it's me. I'm okay. Beth's dead, Mom. Yeah, I know he called you, but... Yeah, he's in the car, we're driving back. No, he's fine. Mom, listen... Mom, stop talking. Ritchie was cheating on me with both of them. Hello? Mom, are you there? Did you hear what I just said? After the wedding what? You think I should still marry someone like that? So send out un-invites, put an ad in the fucking gazette for all I care. I'm talking to you now. Can you please listen to what I'm saying? What part of that don't you understand? He was fucking my best friends. Please. I don't want to just come home and move on. I just... I'm unhappy, Mom. I'm just asking you to be my mother, please. How will it ever be all right? How? This is the rest of my life, Mom. Please. Fuck. Real deal baby blues. Come on, come on, come on. How strong are you? Come on. You took your time. Everything okay? My turn to drive. I don't mind going the whole way. - So I've heard. - -What? I wanna drive, Ritchie. It occupies my mind. - Are you sure you're up for it? - -Just get in, okay? Eyes getting heavy, huh? Yeah. Yeah, I guess. It's a long ride out here. We should talk, then. Before you sleep. Yeah, now you want to talk? Yeah, yeah, now I feel like being in charge for a change. - Do you mind? - -What? - What do you mean? We both know you had to take my side back there. I mean, you weren't gonna take poor fucking Suzy home to the parents were you, huh? Your mom was pretty specific about keeping me happy and having the perfect fucking society wedding. It's not like that. Oh, don't bother. You know what? I've been on this path for so long with you, I felt I kinda had to see it out to conclusion. I mean, if the marriage didn't work out, then I'd divorce, okay? I mean, you know, I wouldn't have to go crawling back to my parents. But then you had to go and fuck my so-called friends. April, I still wanna marry you. Maybe I could actually work on my parents a little. I mean, a bereaved daughter is surely sympathetic. Although I'm not sure I can put up with mom long enough for that, though. I mean, you do understand what you've pushed me to, don't you? Bereaved? Uh... What do you mean? I mean, there's not gonna be a wedding for you. Not now. Not ever. You, son of a bitch! What's... what's wrong with me? Suzy's sleeping tablets, proper ones apparently. I mixed a bunch into that drink and in a minute, you'll be fast asleep. And you are not gonna wake up. April, why? When everybody hears what you've done to me, they'll understand why I had to break up with you and maybe... Just maybe they'll understand why you couldn't bear to go on without me. I mean, you couldn't bear the shame of going home and having to explain to your family how you'd finally broken my heart. Tsk, tsk, tsk. Oh, poor April. And they'll say, "He didn't really wanna kill himself," that it was just a cry for help, but, I mean, he just didn't realize how far away help would be... And the desert is a really big place, Ritchie. Tsk. I hope your parents will get your obituary in the society pages. Look at me, you fucking coward. You fucking coward, look at me! Look at me! Look at me! Look what you've done! Look! Bye-bye, Ritchie. Oh, you really are disgusting. Thank you, girls. 911. What's your emergency? Hi, I've been trying to get a signal. I... I need some help, please. My boyfriend's tried to kill himself in my car. I don't know what I'm supposed to do. We're in the middle of nowhere. I think we're on the I-70. We need someone. Please, I don't know what to do. Ma'am, just slow down for a second, please. I... What? I can't hear you, the line is terrible. Please, we need an ambulance. Where exactly are you?
