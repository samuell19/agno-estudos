It was just stuck. - Thank you Lolo. Are you sure there's nothing wrong with you? - Nothing Sir. Is there, a problem? When you get your uniform back. Rest first. Then you can eat Japanese food. Uh Grandpa? Grandpa, when you were my age, did you wish you could fly away? and soar high in to the sky? Even today. Especially when your grandma nags, It would be nice to escape and fly. But of course, we can't escape from things that we don't like right? We don't want to do it anymore, but we need to deal with it. Because of this we can learn. Miong, tomorrow take down that termite mound at the back of the house. They might come in to the house, then it will be expensive to get rid of those pests Why don't we leave the mound alone? Remember when we were young? We learned that trolls and our spirit ancestors live in those mounds. My gosh! You Miong! There are no trolls or flying things! There are modern times now, our spirit ancestors don't exist now. There's only one stone there. Modern? Modern? Call an exterminator so the troll can mad at him. Or you do it if you want. Are you a spirit ancestor? You're like your grandson believing in spirits. Hey! - Yes ma'am? Well, you've been quiet for a while huh? It's nothing Grandma. I have on my mind a... our project for school. Ah! What's the subject of your project? Philippine History: Grandpa Miong is a teacher of that! He's an expert! Especially of trolls. Ha ha ha! - No more respect! This child is more mature. This is a child here! I thought who's the child! Are you going to teach this to your grandchild? Okay, okay - Grandpa, Grandma, I'm going to my classmate's house. So we can work on our project. - Why don't you go tomorrow? After all, it's Saturday tomorrow. There's no going to school. - That's right Buboy. Go tomorrow instead. We need to finish our project tonight. Because my classmate's friend is going out of town tomorrow. The family is going until Sunday. That's why we have to do it tonight. Is that so? Okay okay. But let your grandpa go with you. Uh, no Grandma. The house is only on the other side of the street. also, I'll return immediately. Uh, okay grandchild. Be careful ok? - Yes Grandpa Yes be careful my grandchild ok? Be careful! - Bye ma'am!

This is it Grandpa. - Buboy, this is the picture I mentioned. - Oh! That's not my mom. Be careful while you travel here in Elementalia. Buboy, catch the sun's rays Use this mirror and reflect it against the wall. Then put the photo between the mirror and the wall. There's my grandpa and grandma! Are they still alive? - Yes Buboy, they are still alive. But they are already under a curse. - A curse?! According to this in my book, the curse can be annulled, when they pour out a unique potion before the next full moon When is that grandpa? - Tomorrow night. - Tomorrow sir? Do you have the potion? - I don't Buboy. You need to travel to different parts of the Elementalia to get the components. and you Buboy, are the one who needs to do this. The potion will only work if the components were gathered by the person who badly needed it. Me sir? I don't know anything here in Elementalia! - I can come with you Buboy. Can I grandpa? It's possible. But Buboy himself must collect the things needed. - What are the things Buboy needs to collect? Spring water beneath the lake of the mermen. Bubbles from the Dragon Fireflies. Fruit from the Poya Poya Tree. Once you have all the ingredients, Immediately return here. Then I will make the potion. We'll leave now grandpa. - You can't travel Elementalia in regular clothes! It's a dangerous land, especially for Buboy. Change child. You have clothes over there right? - How about Buboy? Hal-Lan, there is news for us; there is a human wanderer now here in Elementalia. That's something to cry about. You may have to scare him with your monsters, and keep him separated from his grandparents. He must not succeed. There! Good thing we are the same size! Use this for your protection. - But Grandpa Nano, I don't know how to use this. You've got to learn. Your journey is more important than you'll ever know. Here we go! Hmm. I'm pretty sure this is it. But where is the springs that Grandpa Nano mentioned? Wait bro. - Where could it be? Yo dudes! I heard voices down there. but I can't see anything. - What do you think Buboy? Should we go? Wait a minute. Are you thinking what I am? Woah! Just you guys then. I'm not a sea horse! Grandpa Nano was right. They're really beautiful! I've never seen mermaids and mermen. That's right. Let's go. We'll ask for some water from their springs. Wait a moment. Remember what grandpa Nano said? The mermen are guarding the springs, so they won't just let us take the water. Huh? So what do we need to do? - Hmm. Ah! Grandpa Nano said, "The mermaid and mermen will fall asleep when they hear an angelic voice singing". Oh! Is this dirty work? - No, they won't die, just sleep. - No. It's when you said... My voice is ugly. Ahem. - What? Is your throat hurting? - Hello! My voice is beautiful! I'm so good at singing! You heard me sing at grandpa's right? - Oh yea! So, what now? - Okay, I'll sing. Then, when they sleep, you go to the spring, to get the water. Then come immediately back here. Then, we leave. Then... Okay. Game! - Ahh ay! Ahem. Ay, ay salidumay, Salidumay diway. Merfolk's trip and from within. Make them all sleep and at my whim. Ay, ay salidumay, Salidumay diway.

Please? - Okay fine, you're the boss. - Alright kids, you take care, cause I care. You just wait here Narsi okay? - Sure bro. Rock On! Oh my gosh Buboy!

Thank you so much! - No problem dude! What are friends are for? Hmm? that Wanderer would be mine now. Tell the Vampires to get ready. I know my child, that you resent me. Because I'm too strict with you. I also know, that I haven't been much of a father to you. You see, I'm often not at home. You see, I'm too busy with work. We hardly see each other at home. We don't eat dinner, even on weekends. I just wish my child, I just wish, that you don't think I wanted this. I know that it's hard for you and I have nothing to tell you. But now, my child, I love you so much. I love you so much. You have no...Your mother is gone. You are the only most important person in my life. And I will never forgive myself if I lose you too.

Let's go there! - Alright! Narsi. What's that? Do you know how to use that there? - I've been practicing. - Really? When... Need some help boys? - Oh Ana! Excuse me. Help me! Oh it's like that?
