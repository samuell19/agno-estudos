Matthew knew it was hopeless, Nothing mater anymore Mr White's body was melting and even as Matthew watched The snowman could no longer speak. The happy face Matthew had loved, now was nothing than slush Matthew stared up in to the sky, watching the winter's last snowflake floating down, Some said it's touch held the power of magic But Matthew hat lost it's faith in stories. When the snowflake finally touched Mr. White out stretched arm. a coating of fresh frost spread outward from it and the puddle of water under the snowman, crackled as it turned to ice Matthew's heart filled with joy As he watched Mr. White come a life. The story of winter's last snowflake had come true. The magical winter. Would never end. Time to go too bed, Children. you're that new boy? Tom? You made that snowman, in the backyard.

I don't want that, it's broken What are you doing? It's mine. I'll have what she's having Who are you? you used to play so beautiful, Tom You had a song for every little thing in your life It's a shame it had to end I understand You quit calling me Tom, you don't even know me It's you who no longer knows people, Tom. And it's your own fault, for feeding him Don't let him take all of you Wait These doors of yours aren't going to keep your secrets safe from me Dad, I had a bad dream What are you doing? Nothing I'm doing nothing at all. It's bedtime, go back to sleep Dad.. Is this about your mother again? The circus.. ..it's not until tomorrow Just go to bed Dad What? Are you scared? How can you be scared of it, if you've never even seen it? Huh? Huh? Look, it's just a bunch of clowns And trapeze artists, wearing tights That's all Alright? Buddy Back to bed now Thomas Yes, sir Nothing Bed Now No No A snow storm is still escalating and the temperature is falling fast Our friends in the weather department are forecasting record-breaking cold today So it's a good idea to stay indoors, especially for the elderly The authorities are warning of possible blackouts, so take extra care Maybe get yourself some batteries, candles and keep an eye on for your elders Hello Mmm, well, well, well, look at you! You're beautiful Ann.. of course. How did you get in here? It's a magic trick I can't reveal the secret But it involved a brick Well, it's nice to see you What happened to 'You Destroyed My Life You Old Bitch'? Nobody destroyed my life. You people just did what you wanted Everyone for themselves, right? It's unfair Wasn't like that Really? what was it like? Because the band, and the tours, and the money, and all that stupid crap That seemed a lot more important to my dad.. ..than anything that had to do with me, or my mom And even when he was home, he was never here. He was always lost inside his own mind. Anyway, I don't care You may have unresolved issues with Tom. I don't Oooh, yeah. I can see that Well, it's not like I've ever been a part of his life, so You were always the most important part of his life Yeah, that's better Aah I don't know why he had to put the bad ones up too He just could never let go Who How cute You used to be a happy kid Used to be. All thanks to him All he ever wanted was to forget everything And move on with you Of course, it didn't work out You know, Ann, was a long time ago You really should just let it go When you get old enough, you don't fear death anymore You wait for it. And after a while, you hope for it.. ..even if you don't admit it. Do you know what? Because losing your mind before you go is worse than dying You hope your, will check out before your brain turns to some mush Yeah well, you still seem pretty sharp I'm talking about your father He's in a dark place right now Doesn't, bother you, not knowing how he remembers you? No. I think it bothers you more If he remembers me at all, it's as something that was broken and then put back together And he was never really good at fixing things He did the best he could I'm tired You ought be more careful, buddy Else you're going to turn this into a nightmare No, you're hurting me You know I would never do that I want what's best for you Stop Oh, now this is the real deal Hey, buddy, what are you doing over there? Come here, they're starting Ha,ha,ha Sorry, now I get it. You're part of the act Oh, I got to see this. Daddy Ladies and gentlemen Be heartlessly welcome, to Cirque the Morgue And what a show we have for you tonight Madam Mr. Thomas Whitman A composer and a poet A bad, bad father With a bad, bad memory No, please, don't No Don't Oh, look, this one's about your wife Just about nothing left of her, I see Hardly, worth the effort Memories, it's not like you have any real use for them We all lose parts of ourselves, bit by bit by bit What??? What the hell!! that's not how it turns out Stop, that's all wrong, total. Change it You're wrecking it!!! You, Whoa Thomas Yes, sir Nothing Bed, now God dammit How many digits do these things usually have? I don't know Just don't try to break it. It won't work Mm We need to get this stupid thing open Why, Ann? Cause when Tom locks something away, it's important He didn't have any money. You guys pissed all of it away A little bitter, are we? About having to pay for his care, actually, yes, I am You did a good thing You let him stay here, at home, with his memories Not so bad for somebody who doesn't care about her father What were my options? It was either that, or have every goddamn family friend drown me in guilt Nonsense This family has pretty well out of friends for at least a decade, sweetheart I wonder why, what with Tom being so famous for caring about people Uh I keep telling you He cared Another magic trick He picks something that he knew he would never forget What a cliché What's in there? "But all I am is smoke and mirrors" It's about him There's a shock "Miracles come in small packages" "It takes so little to turn a child into the most fortunate being in the world" Uh No, stop Leave me, Let me hate you Wait, who are you? Please, Wait!! So, satisfied now, are we? Yes. Because this..,this is what I grew up with, Scattered pages, songs, words of wisdom fairy tales all around me You see that thing? His precious arabesque? His princess. He said the dancer inside would spin, if I managed to play the chords right when I was learning the piano Look, Gem.. No His idea of raising me was to feed me these endless pipe dreams and weird monologues Because everything was a performance to him And he did the same thing to my mom. Strung her along Kept making and breaking promises. And she always believed him Always. And he always disappointed her Because you, you came first And then, she ended up dead because of you I hope it was worth it Oh, shit! Bonjour, mon general This, This.. this is how small I was in his magical, musical world Do you know, he'd written songs for everyone around him? Maybe even for this little bastard here But never, never for my mom, or me Un, deux, trois, quatre Bonjour, mon general. You were fortunate to find your way What's happening? Where am I? Why the battlefield, Sir You've fought in this room for many years I'm ashamed that I wounded you so grievously, and for nothing I don't know what you mean Please, Sir, don't spare my feelings It was a mighty blow I struck I can only beg for your forgiveness I stepped on you I ambushed you But, Sir, my motives were pure It was a brave attempt to stop you from going with the accursed snowman That evil pig It's the memories, Sir He takes them. Takes you further in the darkness But why? You got old Still, you've got the best of him, at least for now The best memories hurt him You've chased the very best one That girl Yes, your daughter Ha, ha, ha - What a girl what a memory. Ah~ c'est magnifique You remember best through the things you both shared as children Like myself or the pretty mademoiselle.. ..within the glass bubble Hm, yes, you loved us well, and so did your daughter I don't remember her Ah, well There's nothing to be done then. C'est la vie This is as far as we go No Sir I need your help I need to remember her I need to find her Comrad En avant, marche You still have memories that were precious to you You hid them, we know where, it's not too far I don't think I have many left Oh, no I don't even know who am I anymore We all take wounds, Sir Oh, I'm sorry about that Don't be, Sir. I'm a mere soldier, just a casualty of war You could have disposed of us, instead, you hand us on, and you told your daughter how important we were Hourra! Hourra! We have to hurry, Sir The night your mother had the accident, if Tom had gotten home earlier, things might have been different He was with you, Ann It's not what you think uh Back then, my life was out of control I'm so crazy, with the band, with everything Got too much for me. I took some pills, but I didn't take enough, Because I woke up And then, when I did, Tom was there. I didn't plan it that way I don't want to hear this He stayed with me, but he would not look at me, not after what I had done I bet that little stunt really screwed with your precious band No, no. Yeah, it was the end of the band True, but no. You see, what I'd done was.. Ah~, I don't know, too personal for him You don't know? Know what? Oh, Gem, honey You don't know that Tom's father killed himself? Yeah, Theodore Whitman shot himself in the head And Tom watched it happen What I did, was hard on him And that night, your mother had the accident That's what broke up the band He didn't care, but he knew he was going to lose you as well Why are you telling me this? Because I don't think you know your father at all He worshiped Theodore in spite of his dark moods From what Tom told me, he could be really mean So, when Tom felt himself going down the same path, he pushed you away I know, he pushed very hard We have arrived, Sir I remember.. ..yes, I locked them away, they're here May I say, Sir, it has been a pleasure to serve you, and yours Halt! "Miracles come in small packages, it takes so little to turn a child into Into the most fortunate being in the world "It wasn't much of a circus. It was cheap, shabby and rundown. And she was enchanted by everything she saw, Laughing and squeezing my hand The first time I felt like a father, watching her smile. Why couldn't he just told me this? He did tell you, in his way. The only way he knew Oh man, I was always hoping there might be something that would make it all worthwhile Not this nonsense Oh my God These aren't just scattered thoughts or feelings, look Mon dieu, a l'attaque Some of this is complete, but the rest.. ..his words stop or just trail off Gaps, spaces.. "She's a true reflection of her mother, my broken missing love So small but as wise and as beautiful as she was I am proud with love Now I push her away She must not share my darkness I hope she'll understand one day. So this is where you stashed all the good stuff, huh? What? this? I just took a bit of a beating, is all You should see your little friends I know what you've been up to.. Congratulations What did we learn, huh? Your daddy had his fill of you, took his own life The songbird tried the same trick Then there's your little girl, she hates you Nothing left if you ask me.. It seems like you don't have much left either I've got one thing.. ..magic Light brings darkness, what sweet irony It's your world, your rules Now I wonder who dreamed that up And, here it comes It's like watching your greatest fear come alive Ann, Ann Look That's your dad for you Yeah, but just look at it. I mean, he did all this by hand There are spaces, things he didn't finish He started writing things down, When he realized that he was losing his mind So where is the last page? What was it? All these fragments, memories, it's his li.. Oh, great Hold on, I'll check if it's a fuse Yep, it's the power. Of course, the phone's dead I'm going over there Oh, Goddammit, I can't call a cab Hey, I got a car Really, let's go Sorry, old man Your daughter is not picking up her phone Must be the storm Ah..... ah, No Not yet, I'm not finished It's nearly over now What are you gonna do, outmaneuver me? You're on a track, you idiot I know what's down there, and you're not going to like it I won't let you do this You won't get that lucky again E minor I was right, she did spin You hurry right in, I'll park the car Go, I'll be right with you Got you now. I'm all the future you'll ever have, buddy No!! You won't take my life from me again But I am gonna make what's left of it, a living hell But why? Like you don't know, all your music, all your hopes they're just ruins and blank canvas now I'm all that you can bring to mind. You tell me why I can't help it You always knew I was poison, you could have chosen her if you'd cut me down to size But you built me stronger every year I had to ..I never wanted to lose the memory of you I've wiped you clean of useless dreams and memories, you weak little brat Dad, please I'll drag you down with me, you always knew I would Dad, no I have to let you go Daddy Daddy Thanks for the ride Please sleep tight, Princess I'm here I'm so sorry Daddy He, what you wanted? Fran.... What? Francine!! I'll hope to hear the chords played again one day Without them I'm lost in this nothingness Wandering after far off music, through a desert of ashes If a tune had a colour, it would be a mixture of pink and red Constantly afraid of it fading away Terrified of the silence that may come My final memories are pulling me, towards the end of a black alley There 's a door in the darkness I struggle, to find my way through the dooru I can hear it clearly now The most beautiful melody ever created by man I enter the room.. ..and there, forever remains.. that change from G, to E minor
