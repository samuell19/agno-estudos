Here, we find out that this is hell, not a camp. We were at the gates of hell. To them, we were not human beings. To them, we were just like an animal. My father was taken to one of the subcamps of Dachau and my mother and little brother were taken from there to , to Auschwitz, to Auschwitz. Of course, they were killed the same day. I received a number 106016. And from then on, I was no longer Andrzej Branecki. I became that number. They brought me to Dachau from Zaporizhia in October, 1943. 216 of us were being transported, all captives of the Zaporozhian SD prison. My friend and I decided to leave Holland and get to Great Britain to join the army. The only way of getting to the other side of the English Channel was to use an old kayak. The German Army stopped us. With our hands behind our heads, we were transported from to. After that, we were taken to Dachau. It turned out that the cars are filled primarily with the deceased. I wasn't chosen for the malaria experiments because I contracted typhus. When I contracted typhoid fever, it was already April of 1945. At the end of January 1943, Hitler sent me to the language corps to Auschwitz. The weather soon changed for the worse. We began to send an SOS signal. Three German boats swam up to us. Instead of going to Great Britain, we ended up in the concentration camp Dachau. It was said that Dachau is a place without God. I can't believe I survived. God bless you that I can tell you all about it. Detained in Annecy and subsequently transported to the camp in Dachau. Germany, February 28th, 1933. A special ordinance for the protection of the nation and state was put into effect. In cases of disloyalty among German citizens towards the Third Reich and the Fuhrer, it allowed specific restrictions to be introduced, that of personal freedom, right of speech, and the right to organize. Meanwhile, confiscations, searches, arrests, and jail sentences without a trial for people suspected of being enemies of the German nation and state were allowed. Great times are only beginning. Germany has been awakened. We have gained power over the country. Now, we need to win over the German people. I know my comrades, we have been through difficult times when you have demanded changes that never came. So we must appeal again and again to continue the struggle. You cannot act alone. You must listen. You must succumb. You have to surrender to the overwhelming need for obedience. The first German concentration camp was built in a small Bavarian town a mere 20 kilometers from Munich. Dachau was established by Heinrich Himmler March 21st, 1933, an entire six years before the start of World War II. In the times before the war, the prisoners consisted mainly of the German people, enemies of the regime, along with the clergy, and Jews. The layout of the camp was simple. The larger areas surrounded by a brick wall was reserved for the prisoners. They were kept in 18 long barracks with about 200 individuals in each. As the war began, Dachau became a prototype for a rapidly growing number of Nazi camps throughout Europe. Mauthausen Gusen, Sachsenhausen, and Auschwitz were also based on its construction. It wasn't just the concept of such a camp that became widespread. The building, arrangement, the floor plan, even the manner in which the prisoners were treated were the same. Before the start of the war, Dachau was a training area for future camp commandants. During the war, the number of people in the extremely overpopulated camp reached as many as 16,000. Hitler's aggressive politics soon expanded beyond the borders of the Reich, beginning in 1936 with the German Army occupying Rhineland and followed by the annexation of Austria. Hitler's next targets, Czechoslovakia and Klaipeda County, are captured in March, 1939. His attack on Poland on September 1st, 1939, marks the beginning of World War II. I received my ordination of priesthood June 3rd, 1939. And I was appointed as vicar in Klebowiec, three kilometers away from the former Polish German border. When the war began, I remember the rector asking Governor What the people should do. The governor said that those who are young and able to join the army should escape. 1939, my life was turned upside down when the Nazis occupied our city of Loich. Two soldiers burst in. They arrested me and took me to Germany as a hostage. They they forced me to sign a document stating that if something happens to a German in Klebowiec or the surrounding area, I am to be shot. Europe waits. Warsaw surrenders September 28th. A large bus with barred windows left the former Wittelsbach Square in Munich. Feeling melancholic, my mind drifted to the memory of saying goodbye to my wife. I could still see her teary-eyed face. For as soon as the bus passed , it turned off the road that led to the city Dachau. You entered through a wide gate, holding up a sign that read. The Germans used terror and persecution to create strict order in the occupied territories. The remaining morale was to be crushed by the radical and ruthless politics of the master race. You will be my witnesses, Archbishop Kazimierz Majdanski. The arrest take place in stages according to a code known only to the almighty Gestapo. There are 43 of us, clergy professors as well as seminary educators, curialists, parish priests, and reverends. A plan to destroy the Polish clergy is underway. The concept applied to powerful social classes, namely the clergy, and those who as priests had a large influence on the society. One day in 1940, they brought out 40 people, everyone I knew to a gallows. At that gallows, I saw the butcher, the plumber, the , the author, the doctor, the lawyer, all of them known to me. But one of the things that I'll never forget because we had to stand there watching as hangings were going on and what they were doing every time they put the noose around the neck. They asked, "Is the noose too tight?" And then they would hang each individually. But the bad part about it is I had to watch my own teacher being hung while all of us have been standing around for hours watching this as the Germans were filming it, taking pictures, and laughing the entire time. At night, we were transported to a train and put into cattle cars. Where are we going? No one knows. And then the older priests said they now know where we are headed. We are headed towards Dachau. When they marched in, they gave us 10 minutes to leave the main city and pushed us into a place which was an old part of the city. Filthy, dirty. 230,000 people were pushed into a place of four square kilometers. If that wasn't enough, children under the age of 10 were not allowed to be in the city. They told us all the children under 10 will be sent to a colony. But they didn't really do. With those children, they sent him to a gas chamber in. I was lucky because my father had the foresight. Those camps were not extermination camps, but every second, people died, because it was impossible to stay alive. And ever since, I've been calling my father the angel because he saved me from calamity. He saved me from troubles. The example that I gave, he changed my age, that I was born in 1927. Because having a birthday in 1927, I could go ahead and have a passport to work. I worked as a cloth cutter for four and a half or something like that years, from 1940 until 1944. I spent 24 hours in Terezin, six weeks in Birkenau and. Within five weeks, I had already lost eight members of my family. Only one of my brothers survived the war. The rest died in the gas chambers. The true journey was long, but we still didn't know where we were going. We arrived at a place called Auschwitz. We still didn't know what it was because all we saw was a selection ramp. I was selected to go with my mother, and my brother, and the younger cousins, and all the women. My father had the foresight to have a copy of my documents which was one, the work permit, and the other one was the registration with the Gestapo to prove that I was born in 1927, that I was strong, I worked for German authorities all this time. I had no idea where I was. For the next few days, the only things I thought about were that I was locked up and I didn't know why. I was arrested for being part of a communist guerilla division of an anti-fascist group. On January 6th, 1944, Soviet soldiers cross the former borders of Poland. We were sent out of Warsaw when the Soviet Army was approaching the Vistula. We walked 120 kilometers in wooden shoes. We went by foot from Warsaw to. We were very thirsty. Our whole group descended under a bridge by the Vistula. And when we began drinking the water, the Nazis began shooting at us. The water was like blood. It was red from the blood. We waited for the train, and August 6th, 1944, we arrived here to Dachau. June 6th, the allies land in Normandy. A growing number of prisoners evacuated from camps situated near the war zone are being transferred to Dachau. Around 1,000 left Frankfurt for Buchenwald. Only 350 made it. The rest were shot on the way. Those who had no more strength to walk laid down in a ditch. And the first of the SS men who walked after every three rows would shoot them. It turned out that the cars are filled primarily with the deceased. Very few remained alive. When they opened the doors, they gave us a choice, camp or crematorium. The Warsaw Uprising breaks out on August 1st, Forcing the Germans to begin deporting residents of suburban towns near Warsaw. Here, we find out that this is hell, not a camp. We were at the gates of hell. It was said that Dachau is a place without God, that the cruelty there was so terrifying, the savagery so horrendous, that it was impossible to believe that man could act this way and be so brutal towards another human. They took us 10 at a time, made us undress. Only suspenders and handkerchiefs were allowed. After the shower, we received new numbers, each his own. I got 11424. I walked naked with only a number in my hand to the next lavatory. Clothes were already prepared and set on a bench. It was a short fustian shirt with blue stripes and a few holes here and there. I felt that everything but my mind and heart had underwent some kind of bizarre transformation. I arrived at Dachau on April 26th of 1945 and I was already sick with typhus. A prisoner has no rights other than the right to die. For him, liberation and freedom means passing through the chimney of the crematorium. The law is equality before death of starvation, exhaustion, or of other causes. Who you were and how you had lived has to be immediately forgotten. Here, you are just a number. The instinct of self-preservation should show the prisoner ways to instantly adapt to the circumstances and surroundings with no objection or criticism. It is best not to think. Here, those who cannot handle the mental stress are generally the ones to die. Most people who are survivors, they call themselves prisoners. I don't use that word because we were slave laborers. The Germans needed us because most of the Germans were on the front. Father Wincenty Frelichowski was in my chamber. He was known for being very religious and calm. In the evenings as we laid down to sleep, he would lead us in evening prayer. He even had the Holy Sacrament with which he would bless us all. Then when typhus broke out, people were dying in the barrack. For the sick, what to do? He said, "I'll go." And he went and preached and prepared the sick for death. He contracted the disease there and died. Daily life in concentration camp. Get up five o'clock in the morning. Appellplatz,. They were torturing you for a couple hours and then we had to go to work. 12 hours work a day without food. Only when we came back in the evening, appellplatz again, torturing again, and then got some soup and a slice of bread, some margarine. The day in the life of a prisoner. Wake up at 5:00 a.m., shower, then make the bed. After receiving nothing but black coffee, you march to the roll call square, where standing in rows, the inmates are meticulously counted. We had to be counted on the appellplatz to count how many people died and how many people are alive. After a thorough inspection, the kapo would sound a whistle, And every prisoner would head out to their designated work area. And when the German officer was satisfied that the numbers were the same as the day before between the deadlines and the live ones, we started to march. And we came to a place called. In , they were building a special underground factory. We were placed in block four. We were young, 14, 15, 13 years old. They designated us to work in the sewing workshop where we were taught how to patch camp clothing. There was a kapo in the sewing workshop. He was a Russian. One time, the chief's jumper went missing and the kapo pointed to me. As punishment, the chief move me to barrack number nine where those six typhus were located. Among the bedridden were Polish and Czech priests, Russians, and people of different nationalities. The worst unit was the one that collected the dead. You would have to ride from barrack to barrack in a very large vehicle and gather the bodies. I served in this unit for 14 days. You didn't get any food. You didn't get any water. And it didn't work fast enough, they would beat you. There were many cruel punishments. During the most painful one, prisoners were taken to the bath area where they were hung on special hooks by their hands. You could hear drops of sweat falling on the floor. I stole a piece of bread from the German officer that I saw or maybe he was just a plain soldier that he laid it down on the table. And I was punished for that. Stanislaw Gresiuk in his book recalls, "I once had a dreadful encounter next to that chest." Inside it, I found a large amount of paper thickly covered in cheese curd. I snatched some of it, turned around, and walked straight into an SS man. At first, he beat me calmly and steadily. However, he gradually became more eager with his blows. He became vicious. He grabbed a peg thicker than a leg of a table and beat me with it. When I saw him with foam in his mouth hitting me with the peg, I thought he had gone mad and now he was going to kill me. Not for a moment did I think it would end in any other way. There were SS men who would commit to killing 10 people a day, and they did. In order to increase the efficiency of the German soldier, Headquarters of the Third Reich commissioned a series of pseudo-medical experiments. Returning to our block, we were met with the horrible surprise. While being inspected by the oberkapo of the camp hospital, Zimmermann, who often worked as a local surgeon, he ordered the numbers of the chosen prisoners to be noted. As we're standing there, he selects 10 to 15 young people from our unit and takes them to the camp hospital where they become guinea pigs. An eerie stillness hung over the room. Within me, a dead silence. Healthy prisoners were injected with phlegmon and oil. They began to draw numbers. Once they finished, the chosen ones were taken away. Where did they go? First, on an operating table, it was quick. An SS man painfully punctured the right thigh, a powerful injection. The Luftwaffe commissions experiments that are potentially useful for the German Air Force. A large amount of prisoners die in brutal ways. Doctors gather information about pressure chamber tests and how long humans are capable of survival in cold water. Healthy patients were frozen in pools with cold water. They were testing how humans react to cold temperatures. Approximately 6,000 prisoners took part in the experiments, of which as many as 2,000 people did not survive. Harsh conditions and massive overcrowding in the camp by the end of the war caused the outbreak of typhoid fever. Starting with a high fever, severe headaches, and rapid breathing, after about five days, the illness causes substantial weight loss, usually leading to death. At the end almost before liberation time, I contracted typhoid fever. You call it typhus. Again, my father, the angel, managed to save me because there was no medicine. After his working day, he would come at night to the special sick barrack and bring me a cup of hot water. And that's what saved me was the hot water on a daily basis for almost two weeks. Spring of 1945, the American Army is closing in on Munich. Under Himmler's orders, no prisoner can fall into the hands of the enemy alive. Before our release, I was part of a group in Dachau whose goal was to contact the American Army. We begged them to come and free the camp as quickly as they could because we did not know what lay ahead, life or extermination. The sounds of guns and machine guns filled the camp. Countless SS men reinforced the watchtowers. I escaped from the unit with my friend near the city of Wolfratshausen. The unit continued forward towards the Alps where it would reach its destination,. My friend told me that when we reached the mountains, they would kill us. We knew the war was ending and we needed to survive, so we ran. Morning came and blocks still capable of walking gathered on the main square. People were saying the camp was being evacuated to the Tyrol mountains, a journey to be made on foot. The square was covered in piles of garbage, clothes, fires, and junk. Documents from And prisoner files were being hastily burned. Allies' spy planes were circling above the camp, destroying the local lines of communication, attacking columns of troops and motor vehicles. Each prisoner had two rolled up blankets and a package. No food for the journey was distributed. After a few hours, we were ordered to head back to our blocks. Saturday morning, once more, we gathered in the main square and told that there would be no further evacuation. Owing to the ongoing battles, the slowly retreating German Army cannot execute a proper evacuation of the camp Headquarters makes an equally dreadful decision to follow through with Himmler's order and at all costs prevent prisoners from falling into the hands of the allies. April 29th, it turned out that we were all supposed to be exterminated. Traveling commands would constantly return to say the camp is surrounded, that behind its walls, there is only chaos and panic. Everyone is fleeing, even external sectors working in companies and establishments located near the camp. Thousands of prisoners starved, dirty, and exhausted had become mere shadows. Suddenly at 5:30 p.m. in the closest area of the camp, a shootout erupted. I was with the 20th Armored Division. We came into the camp on April 29th, 1945. When the American soldiers entered through the gate, they had no idea they were crossing over into another world, a world where the human life was insignificant. Our tank smashed the barbed wire and the infantry from the 42nd and 45th Divisions rode in on top of our tanks. We didn't see it until we actually got to the barbed wire fence. It was very quiet. Nothing was happening. Many of our men became distraught. Some cried while others raged. It was incredible. We had no idea what was here. The whole thing was a surprise. When we got to the camp, the first thing we saw was a string of 39 railway cars all filled with human bodies. All dead. I think there were about 2,000 dead bodies. It stunned us. The men were looking pretty mad. They were hardened combat veterans. They didn't say much, but there was a lot of cursing, quite a bit of silence, and some men started crying. Suddenly, I see SS men from the tower near barrack 28 firing shots at American soldiers. A moment later, they cease fire and hang up a white flag. They are surrendering. Dachau concentration camp, Professor Popovitch. Yugoslavian. I earned my BA at the University of Cambridge, a Doctorate of Philosophy at the University of London, and the Professor of English in the University of Belgrade. I was put into prison by the German authorities as soon as they arrived to Belgrade. The reason for my arrest was that I was an anglophile. I was actually before the war General Secretary of the Society of Friends of Great Britain and America in Yugoslavia. And the co-editor of an anglophile periodical called. All of a sudden, a few American soldiers burst through the camp gate and entered the square. A crowd of prisoners emerged from various hideouts and ran towards them with screams of joy and excitement. They cheered as they carried their saviors around the square. They were just wonderful. They gave us a big hug and everything. They couldn't believe we were here and that their terrible time had come to an end. 32,000 tormented starving prisoners mad with bliss falling into each other's arms, kissing, crying. The slavery is over. Long live the victorious American Army that brought freedom. We saw and talked to many prisoners. We were told not to feed them too much. They would get sick. We were able to walk down to the crematorium. The wording was freeze the prisoners in place so that they would not get out. Many of them had typhus and they needed medical attention. They needed food, they needed care, and they didn't need to spread out all over the camp and the town. When the Americans entered the camp, they were terrified by what they saw. They said they had never before witnessed the type of savagery that took place in Dachau. They said that Dachau and death are synonymous. We were allowed to walk around and say hello to people, give them some food. And then our officers came and said we had to get out of the camp and go on. And we captured Munich at that point. Many years ago now when I was in the forces to Belsen and I can remember seeing the chairs covered in human skin, and the large vats of fat which would have been boiled for fuel, and large mounds which said here lie toten 500,000 people. I survived this only because of God, because I kept praying to return to Warsaw. I can't believe I survived. God bless you that I can tell you all about it. Finding themselves in this dreadful situation and having to live in awful camp conditions, many prisoners lost faith in God, while others felt his presence and strengthened their belief. When it started, I was 13. And when the war ended, I was 17, so you can imagine four years as a kid in several concentration camps without parents, without food, hard labor. And I'm still alive. Today, I'm 82. It's a miracle. After the war, I asked the same question and I still ask the same question today of the German people. How is it possible that an educated country, an educated people with great history behind them, how could they allow this to happen? What happened in Dachau was inhumane. People were hanged, used in medical experiments. They were cruelly tormented. How was it possible to tell that you didn't know anything about it, that you never saw us when you say us on a daily basis? There is no answer other than they were forced, but they didn't care. I think it's more that they really didn't care because we were not Germans. We were just slaves and numbers. The people from nearby cities were forced to enter the camp to see the true face of Adolf Hitler. Soldiers were ordered to document everything they found in the camp so nobody would ever question the terror and savagery that took place in German concentration camps.
