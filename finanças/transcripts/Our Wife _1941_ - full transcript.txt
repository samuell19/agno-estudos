- Subtitles - Lu?s Filipe Bernardes - Oh, good evening, professor. - Good evening - Good evening, professor. - Good evening. - Nice seeing you, professor. - Yes, indeed. Dad, I... Same breezes that warmed the cheeks of Balboa and Cortez. I'm going below, Dad. I have some work to do and if I want to go ashore at Panama tomorrow, I... Do you know what you are? Of course, associate professor at Lambert Univeristy traveling to New York. You're an intellectual zombie. Only your mind is alive. Your body is dead and still walking around. What a nasty old man you're going to grow up to be. Susan, you're on a ship in the South Pacific now. I know, I looked at the chart before dinner. Seven degrees latitude, eighty-three degrees longitude to be exact. You've been in that cabin every night since we left San Pedro harbor. Listen to that music, there's romance on this ship. There's romance in science too. The effect of exloding boron atoms, that's your latest flame, isn't it? - I bet you thrill each other to death. - Tom, this is your sister you're talking to. Oh, don't mind him, Dad. Good night. Man overboard! Man overboard! - What did he say? - Man overboard. - Where? - Right over there. I hope he can swim. It might have been a lady. There he is! They got him with a searchlight. Throw him a life preserver. I wonder who he is. - Who is it? - I saw him jump. I saw him go. It happened right over there... Oh, good evening, professor. It's that drunk chap in our corridor. He's been in his cabin the whole trip. But I saw him coming out tonight. His name is Jerry Marvin, but when I said, evening, Mr. Marvin, he pulled himself up and said, the name is John Smith. Boy, he smelled like he'd been bathing in a tub of raw gin. - Did you see him jump? - It's a plain case of suicide. - Jerry Marvin, did you say? - Yes, ma'am. His cabin's right down my corridor. I saw him come out of his cabin just a few moments ago. I said, evening, Mr. Marvin, but he pulled himself up... - Jerry Marvin, I wonder... - Do you know him? There was a musician, a bandleader, I think, whose name was Jerry Marvin. - Quite well-known. - Sure, I remember, it's Marvin. His wife left him, big noise about it in the papers. He came in drunk to lead his band. Began to tap the customers on the head with his baton as they danced by. Said he was knighting them Lord and Lady Jerk. He pulled himself up and looked me straight in the eye and said, the name is John Smith. How romantic, committing suicide over a woman. Romantic? I think it's stupid. You never saw this woman, I did. Here they come with him now. I beg your pardon, no familiarity, please, I don't know you. We were just trying to help you, Mr. Marvin. My name is John Smith. And all that talk about my ancestors and Pocahontas is a lie. I'm Dr. Jenkins, the ship's doctor. Well, where have you been? You ought to be ashamed of yourself not getting here any sooner. I'm sorry, I got here as quickly as I could. Well, don't stand there gaping, look after those men, they're cold. Come in. Come on in! I wonder if you'd stop blowing that horn. - Why should I stop? - I'm next door and it disturbs me. Oh, it does, huh? All I mean is it's darn good tootin'. That's not the issue, I'm trying to do some work. Oh, that's fine, go right ahead. If you have no consideration for me, there's a sick man in this corridor. He tried to commit suicide. Because of my playing? No, of course not, because of a woman. He jumped overboard. I did not jump, I slipped. - Oh, it was you. - Yes. I was fishing for marlin. Early in the evening I said to my horn... We chatter with each other, you know, small talk. You're a little insane, aren't you? Yeah... Who said I tried to commit suicide? Why should I try to commit suicide, answer me that. Oh, come on, speak up, speak up. Well, if you don't know, why should I tell you? You know what you are, you're a busybody. I didn't come here for a character analysis. I came to ask you to stop making that noise before I call the purser. - Come on, Tom, it's almost boat time. - Aw, Susan, stop rushing us. You can't leave the Panama Canal Zone without buying a Panama hat, - it's just not being done. - Well, you've been at it for hours. There comes your friend. Is he pie-eyed. - How much? - Thirty-five dollars. - Thirty-five dollars? - Oh, it's a hundred in the States, se?or. Dad, isn't he going in the wrong direction? I'll give you ten dollars. I'm afraid he's in no condition to know in what direction he's going. - Ten dollars is the best I can do. - Oh, come on, Tom. Thirty-two fifty. Please, se?orita, we have very little time. Hurry, Tom, we'll miss the boat. Would you tell that man he's going in the wrong direction? I'll tell him. I beg your pardon, but you're going in the wrong direction. Oh, boy, there goes the spinning wheel again. What is your name, please? That doesn't matter. The important thing is the boat is in that direction. Pleased to meet you, Mr. Boat. My name's Smith. All that talk about my ancestors and Pocahontas is a lot of malicious gossip. I know, I know. Oh, se?or, you cannot get a Panama like this in the States for thirty-five dollars. I tell you what I do, I'll give it to you for nineteen dollars. - I'll buy you a drink, Mr. Boat... - Not now, some other time. - What'll I do with him? - Oh, get him into the car and let's go. - Drunk at your age. - It's all right, come on, get in. - Eighteen dollars. - Twelve fifty and not a cent more. Fifteen dollars, that's just what it cost me. - Twelve fifty. - Thirteen dollars! Thirteen dollars! Better hurry, gentlemen. There we go, up you go. Where am I... Wait a minute! - What are your intentions? - To get you home. Home. # Be it ever so humble # # There's no place like home # Be... there is no place like home, now is there? No, no, there isn't. No pl... Wait a minute, be honest. There are plenty of places a whole lot better than home, I can name... All right, there are plenty places better than home. Okay, okay, maybe they're like a man. I just don't like all this beating around the bush. Beating ar... Wait, I'll slide down the banister. No, no, not now. Apr?s vous. # Be it ever so humble # # There's no place like home # Watch your step now. That's his cabin. Come on, easy now. Home again. Well! Aren't you in the wrong cabin? Excuse me, lady, but aren't you in the wrong cabin? - This is 214, isn't it? - It is. Well, then you are in the wrong cabin. A-214 is this gentleman's stateroom. Say, if you drunks don't get out of here, I'm going to have my husband call the captain. Well, why don't you call the captain and have them thrown out? Why don't you be quiet, maybe we are in the wrong stateroom. Oh, I'm sure you are, I'm sure this is Mr. Marvin's cabin. The name is Smith. Well, looks like you're wrong. Here, see? Stateroom A-214. That's strange, this is his stateroom too, there must be some mix-up. If you don't get out quick, I'm going to become very nasty. You don't got to become nasty... it's such a lovely night. - Here we go. - Where are we going? There we are. - Nice person. - I'm sure that's his cabin. He's gaining weight by the minute. We'll take him into our suite for the time being. I got a date at 9 o'clock. We'll see that you keep it. Very sweet of you. It's very nice to have met up with you folks. Easy, there we go. Oh, steward. Yes, miss? Steward, what is the number of Mr. Marvin's stateroom, I thought it was A-214. Mr. Marvin disembarked at Cristobal, Miss. You mean... you mean that's as far as he was going? Yes, miss. - Anything wrong? - Oh, no. No, thank you. Dad, something dreadful has... Well, what's happened to him now? He's sleeping. - We're in an awful mess. - What's the matter? - His destination was Cristobal. - What? We're practically kidnappers. - Well, let's get him out of here quick. - What are you going to do with him? - I got it. - What? We'll drop him overboard, everybody'll think it's suicide. - Don't be funny! - Tom, I won't tolerate violence. Besides, somebody might see us. Oh, after all he looks like an intelligent fellow. We'll let him sleep this off and then we'll explain. Yes, we'll explain, how? Well, we... We have nine degrees and two scholarships among the three of us... It has always been my policy when in trouble, to get a good night's sleep and start fresh in the morning. - Yes, but in the meantime... - No matter how you may wish otherwise. He'll be here when we get up. Good morning. Excuse me. Must have gotten in the wrong cabin. The doors in a ship look alike, you know. It's asleep. A couch isn't a very comfortable place to spend the night. I don't usually make a mistake like that. All the doors in a ship look alike. - Yes, I know, but you see, we... - You're perfectly right to be angry. Imagine waking up and finding a strange man in your cabin. I know what I'd feel like if I woke up and found a strange woman in my cabin. Or would I? - What happened? - He apologized for being in the wrong room. Good. What are you doing in my bed? Get out of here! Get out of here! Look, every time I leave that door unlocked are you gonna walk in here? Is it gonna be like that the rest of the trip? I beg your pardon, but this is my stateroom. Are we going to have to go through all that again? I told you and your friends last night when they carried you in here, we engaged this stateroom in Cristobal. Cristobal? - Have we been to Cristobal? - Certainly, didn't your friends tell you? I've been shanghaied. I tried to tell him, but he wouldn't give me a chance. I'm afraid you didn't try very hard, Susan. I'd give a million to see his face when he does find out. Will you please tell me how I came aboard last night? And what I was doing in your cabin? Well, you were going in the wrong direction... The whistle was blowing. And you were in no condition to know what you were doing. I know, I was drunk. Well, what was the idea of bringing me aboard? We didn't know your destination was Cristobal. There are fifteen hundred passengers on this ship. At least half of them must have been intoxicated last night, if you had to pick on some drunk, why me? - You were the prettiest. - Now, Tom, this is a serious situation. I guess we do owe you some sort of an apology. You owe me some sort of an apology? You owe me a definite apology. My bags are all in Cristobal, my horn, I never travel without my horn. Can't we borrow one that will fit you? Well, I'm sorry, we meant well. I hope it won't inconvenience you too much. You hope you haven't inconvenienced me too much. You hope you haven't inconvenienced me! I've been trying for fifteen months to get a job, I finally get one in Cristobal and you hope you haven't inconvenienced me. I realize this is a difficult situation, but you might behave like something approximating a gentleman. How close in approximation would you like? Close enough for you to stop shouting and use a normal tone of voice! Both of you stop shouting! Shouting is the effort of a limited mind to express itself. - I'll do exact... - Come in. - The coffee. - Just leave it. Yes, sir. I'll admit I've see a lot of meddling stuffed shirts in my time, but compared to you they were decent, self-respecting stuffed shirts. They stayed at home and left the tawdry affairs of the lower classes alone. This is definitely not helping the situation. The only way you can help the situation from now on... ...is to mind your own sweet little business. I don't know whether to laugh or cry. Let's split it up, you laugh and I'll cry. I see a baby choking, I'm going to let it choke. Here we go again. My wallet, I've been robbed. - Don't you dare call us thieves! - I didn't call you thieves. You looked at us and shouted I've been robbed, - willy-nilly you called us thieves. - I did not! We're willing to pay your fair to Havana and back to Cristobal. Look, sister, I've paid my own way ever since I was six. Before that I sponged a little on my mother and father... ...and I've never quite forgiven myself. The thought of it sometimes drives me to drink. That's my hat. Well, that may not be a bawling out, but it'll do until one comes along. We've made a mistake, we've said so, we've apologized, we felt sorry, we tried to make amends, I don't think anything more can be expected of us. I'm afraid we're obligated to ourselves, if not to him. We can't dismiss an obligation that casually. After all, we're responsible for his predicament. - I agree with Dad. - What's the purser's number? 349. Hello? Purser, please. Oh, this is Professor Drake. I'd like to have a first-class cabin as far as Havana. Oh, I see. Thank you. Al filled up. No cabin. Well, Tom can move in with you and he can have Tom's cabin. Tom move in with me? That's too much. I agree with Dad. Well, there's nothing else to be done. Now you go look for him and I'll move Tom's things out. - Oh, hello, Dad. - Well? Not a sign of him. We've been doing this for hours. Playing hide and seek at my age. Did you search the bar thouroughly? Under the tables, behind the bar and in the bartender's hair. - In the bartender's hair? - Yes. - What a silly place to look. - It's just an expression. I wish you'd stop indulging in inaccuracies. Until it can be proven that one can hide in a bartender's hair, I'd prefer you use a more normal expression. Okay, professor. Mr. Marvin. Mr. Marvin. Mr. Marvin. - Oh, it's you again. - You're all wet. I have been for years, but I don't like to be told about it. How in heaven's name could you sleep in all that rain? Well, how would I know it was raining if I was asleep. Now don't be stubborn, come below and get those clothes off. I beg your pardon? Stop playing the fool. We've got you a cabin. - Say, look here... - Now, don't worry, we intend to collect for it, you can give us your IOU. Come along before you catch cold. You got the past tense, I've already caught it. - Isn't this your suite? - Yes, there were no other cabins available. You'll take Tom's room, Tom will double with Dad. - I don't like this. - Don't argue. Get those clothes off, I laid out a robe for you. Come in. - I found this in the bed. - Yes. It was addressed to me so I opened it. - Naturally. - What's the idea of the money? That's your airplane fare back to Cristobal from Havana. Say, why don't you stop trying to be a boy scout. - Why don't you... - Mind my own sweet little business. Yeah. Because we found an opportunity to lend out some more money at 3%. You can only get 1% from the banks. The moment we saw you drunk, we deliberately put you under obligation. We do that to all inebriates, that's the way we live, we have millions invested that way. And what's more, get out of those wet clothes, you're only worth something to us alive not dead and I'm here to protect our investment. - I was just thinking... - Of what?! Some exquisite type of punishment for us? We've tried to make amends. No, I was just... You're dedicating your life to making me, my father and my brother... ...as miserable as you possibly can. If you'd shut up and give me a chance, I'd say I'm sorry. - All right, I'll shut up. - Okay. - Well, say it! - Say what? - You're sorry. - I said it. No you didn't, you said if I'd shut up, you would say it. I'm sorry. Genuinely sorry. Have you eaten anything today? No. Cabin service? This is Miss Drake. What would you like? Scotch and soda. A bowl of soup, please. Hot soup. And for an entr?e? Scotch and soda. Uh, tenderloin steak, rare, and vegetables. And to drink? Scotch and soda. Black coffee, plenty of it. Thank you. And I thought this was going to be such a pleasant association. - Susan! - Yes? - We're coming into Havana harbor. - Be out in a moment, Dad. Well, hurry, it's a beautiful sight. Hurry up, Tom, we're landing in ten minutes. Jerry, Havana. Why do they have to dock these things in the middle of the night? It's 7 a.m. - Well, good morning, good morning... - Good morning. Well, it looks as though this is where I get off. Here's your shirt and your suit, Tom. Except for a few rum drops on the lapels it's good as new. I won't have it cleaned, I'll keep it like this to remember you by. Touching, ain't it. Your tie, professor, thanks for the use of it, I won't forget it. I don't think anybody could forget this tie. It's a little bit on the lounge side. - Your razor. - Thank you. Oh, if you don't mind, I think I'll keep the tooth brush and the tooth paste. Well, that about cleans me up. Come in. - Good morning. - Good morning. You'll present your landing cards to the Cuban immigration officers... ...in the lounge, please. Oh, we have made your plane reservations, sir. It's the morning plane. There'll be a car waiting at the dock to take you to the airport. Sorry we couldn't give you any time in Havana, but the plane schedule was filled up. Thank you. I suggest you go out on deck early, there will be quite a line. Thank you. Well, come on, come on, let's not be the last in line. Lots of things I want to do and see in Havana. You go ahead, I'll get my hat and gloves. I wonder if you can buy a Panama hat in Havana. Yes, come on, come on. I found this in Tom's coat. Oh, Tom has a mania for collecting clippings about me. So you're the S. A. Drake mentioned in the clipping. Uh-huh. Professor S. A. Drake, MS, BS, PhD winner of the Hogarth Fellowship. Say, you're good. No, just lucky. Dad's a scientist, so are all his friends, so, when I was little, they thought it would be amusing to make a scientist out of a girl. - United States citizen? - Yes. - How long are you going to be in New York? - Oh, just for the summer. We have to be back in California for the fall semester. - Where are you going to stay? - I don't know, at a hotel, I suppose. Well, look, I've got a house in Pelham Manor on the bay. Not very far from town, nobody's using it. Why don't you use it? It's pretty hot in New York in the summer and a house is always cool. Oh, thank you very much, I... I don't... It's purely selfish of my part. I'll charge you rent against those IOUs of mine. Oh, but it's got a boat landing and... ...a little beach with the best silver sand outside of a bird cage. Yes, but supposing you wanted to go back to New York? Oh, I wouldn't worry about that. Cristobal's more my size. Yes, the liquor's much cheaper there too. I hadn't thought of that, but now that you've mentioned it, it presents very interesting possibilities. Why do you drink so much? Oh, I don't know. Things get pretty gray sometimes. I tried brightening them up by keeping a lamp lit in the window. It didn't help much. From keeping a lamp lit to keeping myself lit was a natural step. Tom tells me you're quite a composer. Yeah, yeah, all the world is wating for my unwritten compositions. Well, you think you should give up trying just because you and some lady... ...had amatory difficulties? - Landing permits, please. - Oh, yes. Se?or Marvin! Se?or Marvin! Se?or Marvin, we don't have much time, se?or. - This way. - Is that my car? - S?, se?or. - I'll be right with you. Well, uh... Professor, you, know, I always had a snide attitude about college people, but after the last three days I'm sorry I didn't go to college myself. I've always had a similar attitude toward bandleaders too. Now you wish you'd learned how to lead a band, huh? Unconsciously. - Goodbye, Tom. - So long, Jerry. - Goodbye, Susan. - Se?or, please, we will be late. Alright. Oh, the address of the house, I forgot to give it to you. Here, give me a pencil, I'll write it down. - What address? - Susan will explain it. - Well, I didn't say we... - 1746 Riverdale. There we are. Thank you. Oh, and, uh... Don't forget to turn out the... ...pilot light under the hot water heater before you go to bed. - It has a nasty habit of blowing out. - Pilot light? What on earth... - And, uh... - Se?or, please! Okay, okay. The short-wave knob's gone off the radio. You'll find it in the top drawer of the bureau in the living room. Bye. - Bye. - Bye. - Bye. - Bye, Jerry. Hey, the key! You can't get in without the key. Key? What key? Well, S. A. Drake, BS, PhD, I'll be looking for you in the newsreels. That Hogarth prize is a big thing, but I don't make the newsreels. I'll nudge the guy next to me. I used to know that gal. Not only smart, but a good-looking dish to boot. And when I hear your music, am I going to have to nudge the guy next to me and say, not only talented, but a big fool to boot. Se?or, come on, we go right now. Okay. I tell you... Bye! This is it, folks. Oh, this is lovely. The garden looks as though someone were taking care of it. The gardener probably comes in during the day. - Are you sure this is the right address? - It's 1746 Riverdale Drive. You have the key, If it fits, this must be the house. Driver, you'd better wait a minute. Nice. - Dad. - Yes, dear? The windows are open, there are fresh flowers, somebody's living here. Do you suppose his wife has come back? What... What was that? You hear what I hear? Does his wife play the horn too? I wonder if you'd stop blowing that horn. Why should I stop... I'm next door and it disturbs me. - Hello. - Hello. All I mean is that was darn good tooting. What happened to your trip to Cristobal? Well, um... I discovered the liquor wasn't quite as cheap as I thought it was going to be, so I... ...took the clipper home. Well, that's a good reason for not staying. The real reason I came is because I had something to say to you. - Jerry! - Professor Tom! - What are you doing down here? - How on earth did you get here? - By clipper. - I thought Cristobal was your destination. It was, but I had more important things to do back here. Oh, I'm sorry we barged in this way. - Oh, it's all right, I was expecting you. - Well, we'll go back to town. Oh, no, I just dropped in to open up the house. Please, you'll be very comfortable, I'm never around. If I do drop in once a month, there's a spare room. Oh, please, I took your cabin, now you take my house. No, we couldn't think of it. It was different when you weren't going to use it yourself. If you say one more word, I'm going to get sore. Heaven forbid... not again. Oh, come on, New York's awful in the summer, it's hot and sticky. At least this way you'll have some pleasant, cool place to come in the evening. Well, what about yourself, don't you get hot and sticky? Sure, of course I do, that's why I was hoping maybe you'd ask me to stay. - Well, I... - No, it's awful, since I met you people... I never asked anybody for anything before. You've ruined my character. You spoiled my taste for drinking, I've lost my dignity to the extent of begging for a job. What kind of a job? As guest artist with the Beckhart Philharmonic. - Jerry! - Wow! As a matter of fact, before you two came in, I was about to say something to Susan. Oh, excuse us. No, it concerns you too. My word, it's warm in here. - Susan. - Yes, Jerry? You were right. I have no right to deprive the world of my music. That's very generous of you, my boy, very generous. I played some of my stuff for Beckhart, the conductor. He thinks it's swell, thinks I can write a modern symphony. Says if I can and he likes it, he'll produce it. And he's gotta like it. - And you people have to help me. - Just how can we help? By staying here and keeping on meddling in my business. Susan, you started this, it's your decision. Well, will you help Tom upstairs with the bags upstairs? They're out in the hall. Yes, ma'am! Right away, ma'am! If y'all wants anything, ma'am, don't forget to ring, ma'am. Right this way, ma'am, right this way. Susan, how long have you known me? Nigh on all my life, I guess. I've always taught you to make your own decisions, haven't I? That's right. I'm beginning to wonder if I was right. Why, Dad? I'm only thinking of your happiness, my dear. Hey, you Drakes, come on up and see your rooms. We're coming, Jerry. Step right up, folks, the tour of the house begins immediately. This is the only house in Westchester County in which George Washington did not sleep. It was built in 1752 by a farmer named Phineas Culpepper. - Phineas did alright for himself. - He certainly did. Yonder is the master's bedroom, that one's for Tom and the professor, - and this is Mama's room. - Mama's room? Hm-hmm, my mother was the first one to sleep in here. It's the best room in the house, ma'am. The bathroom's over there. Hot and cold water running all the time. There's a big closet over here. And if you should want anything, ma'am, please press the buzzer right next to the bed. The management would like to feel that you're quite comfortable. Oh, and by the way, there's a laboratory downstairs... ...that you can use for your experiments. Laboratory? Yes, ma'am, it's a little room adjoining the study... ...that I use for dabbling at photography sometimes. - You think of everything. - We aim to please, ma'am. Thank you. Uh, if you won't make any complaints to the management, ma'am, there's something I'd like to tell you. But I never make any complaints, ask the bellboys up and down the West Coast. Well, perhaps I'd better not tell you now. Not yet. Maybe after the concert. Thank you, ma'am. Oh, you won't need a key, ma'am, this man-eating monster will protect you. Did my father... Is there a ticket left for me... the name is Drake, Miss Susan Drake? - Yes, ma'am. - Thank you. Sorry, but you'll have to wait till the number's over. - Oh, please. - Sorry. But I won't make a disturbance, I'll be very quiet. That's my orders. But I'm a very good friend of Mr. Marvin's. I'm sorry, ma'am. - Could I just listen here? - Sure, lady. - He's pretty good, isn't he? - Pretty good? - You really think so? - Don't you? Oh, I think he's wonderful. Say, I've been on this door a great many years and I know a hit when I hear one. This guy is a hit. Sorry, ma'am, you'll have to wait till this number's over. Well, there's nothing on this ticket that forces me... ...to stay out here until the number's over. - Sorry, ma'am, orders. - I'm Mrs. Jerome Marvin, the composer's wife. If my own wife came late, I couldn't let her in. My wife's bigger and stronger than I am, she ain't bashful about letting me know it. I don't get around to these concerts much. What do you do in a case like this? You just wait. Seems to me a wife should be able to listen to her own husband blow his horn. Well, don't look at me, lady. After the revolution and I own this joint, I'll let you in. - Cigarette? - No, thank you. Used to burn me to have my performances interrupted. I can understand that. Neither had they ever taught me to come on time for anybody else's. You're not a professional yourself? Well, in a sense, yes. But my performances aren't very intriguing, consequently I have very little audience. That's too bad. Wait till you get up in the big time. - Big time? - The tops, honey. Don't you be discouraged, just keep at it. You look like you got plenty on the ball. Thank you. Do you mind? Say, that husband of mine's doing pretty good. Pretty good? Doing alright. I always knew he had it in him. Who was it said, to know a man you've got to live with him? Was it Pickwick? Oh, I've got to tell that to Jerry, he's got a great sense of humor. Most men have, once in a while. That's it. He tears civilized veneer right off music. He's mixed Americana with African so well you can't tell. So savage, it was wonderful, don't you think? Susan, where have you been? Anything wrong? No, no, nothing. Dr. Hogarth detained me... ...and the doorman wouldn't let me in until intermission. That's too bad. Jerry's doing himself proud. Wasn't he wonderful, I had no idea a man could get such music out of a trumpet. We'll have to go backstage and congratulate him. - No, no, I'd rather not. - Why not? - Let's take our seats. - Susan, it's the right thing to do. Who sharpened his pencils when they were dull? I did. And who lay awake night after night listening to him toot that horn? I did. And now it's a night for us to howl and what happens? I'm rushed off to bed. Aren't you all in bed? I've given up all hope for the two of you. When you can refuse to go backstage even to congratulate a friend... on the night of his greatest triumph, you're still intellectual snobs. You... - What's wrong with you two? - Oh, go to bed, Tom. Not until after Jerry gets here. I sometimes think there must have been a mix-up at the hospital when you were born... ...and we got the wrong brat. That still doesn't explain what brought this on. What brought what on? This frost, this dry ice, this sub-zero cold wave. What the devil are you talking about? Never mind, I just killed myself. I'm dead, I never asked a question, it was all a myth. Susan, you'll always be my favorite daughter. Good night, Dad. I'm going to wait up a little while see if comes. All right. - Tom. - Hm? Jerry's ex-wife was at the music hall tonight. Oh, she was. Well, I bet she went backstage to see Jerry. That's why Susan didn't go. She was afraid she might be intruding... ...since the divorce is not final yet. Well, I still can't underst... You... you mean Susan and Jerry? Go ahead, Dad, and don't put any sentiment into it. Very tempting. I beg your pardon. Mr. Marvin still lives here, doesn't he? - Yes. - Well, I'm Mrs. Marvin. - May I come in and wait for him? - Of course. You do expect him. I missed him at the music hall and... Of, course, I knew I'd seen you before. You're the girl in the lobby. Yes. Imagine us meeting that way. I mean, both of us sort of in the same boat. - Late for the concert. - Yes, it was odd. My woman's intuition certainly wasn't working tonight. Well, there are two schools of thought on woman's intuition. Is that so? You're clever, aren't you? But that's to be expected. Jerry always liked brains around him. Well, everything looks just the same. - Oh, we haven't changed anything. - Been staying here long? - Since June. - Six weeks. Doesn't it bore you? I mean, being way out here so far from town. Well, we like it any place just so long as we can be together. How very cozy. Susan. Oh, this is Tom, he lives here as does my father. Tom, this is Mrs. Marvin. Well... well, so you're Mrs. Marvin, I... - We expect Jerry any minute now. - Well, don't. - Why? He is coming home. - Oh, yes, but not right away. You see, I know Jerry. There's nothing like being married to a man to find out about him. Right now he's at Reuben's. Every time he's had a successful opening he always goes to Reuben's first. The boys and the sturgeon sandwich. Then it's Lindy's. The boys and the chicken liver sandwich. It's been going on for years. Look here, there's no sense in your losing any sleep on my account. You don't have to wait up with me. - We don't mind. - No, it's a pleasure. Oh, please, run along to bed. I don't mind waiting up for him. After all, it isn't as though I were a stranger in a strange house. Well, if you'll excuse us, good night. Good night. Good night. Hello, I... Hello, darling. Well, well, well. I'm sorry I haven't a fatted calf to kill. I don't think that's amusing, darling. Babe, why did you come back? For a very ordinary reason. - I love you, I want to be your wife. - All of this so sudden. You know, Jerry, I was very young when you married me. - I wasn't exactly Methuselah myself. - You were my first love. Yeah, I suppose you had to make a start somewhere. A girl who's known only one man is inclined to go off... ...and search for something she thinks she's missed. - Oh, Babe. - But I came home to you. Oh, please, please, darling. Put out the welcome mat in front of the door for Baby. The same old Babe. Thinks all she has to do is crook her little finger and along comes Jerry. I was at your concert tonight. If you feel you were cheated, I can refund you the price of your ticket. I don't know much about music, were you good? Suppose you read the reviews on your way home? And before you go, the key, please. You know the judge gave me the house. I've missed you, Jerry, missed you like the very devil. When did you begin to pine for me? Right after the concert? I'll lay odds you called your attorney first... ...asking if there was any money in composing music. Would you believe me if I told you that I've learned my lesson? I love you, Jerry. I loved you when I asked for the divorce. Oh, I'm sorry I came. I'm sorry I came to beg forgiveness for hurting you. I'm not sorry you hurt me. Oh, darling... No, because if you hadn't, there wouldn't have been any symphony as you call it. You were a sort of a reverse inspiration. You know, you heard my stuff tonight... but I'll give you a mattress filled with diamonds and rubis if you understood it. I understood one thing, Jerry. It was my man up there on that platform making music for me. In spite of you, Babe, in spite of you. You know that place in the music where it goes... Let me explain it to you. A man meets a woman, it's not a very rare thing, but this guy was dope enough to believe it was. That symphony is about me. Yeah, from your laquered toe-nails to your shellacked hairdo. All the way from the marriage ceremony... ...through those diamond-studded gutters to the divorce courts. - Thanks, Jerry. - No, thank you, Babe. Because every time I get a little discouraged, ...I'll just remember that you said I couldn't do it. All I was worth was leading a high-hatted, long-tail dinner band. Making music for a lot of fat-hip, frustrated witches. You said I couldn't do it, Babe, and I did it. Now I'm glad I came. There are a lot of ways of telling me you love me. And if I remember rightly, you used quite a few of them in your time. But this is really something. Oh, yes, Jerry, you wrote a symphony, in spite of me, against me, well, in spite of against, they aren't far apart. You had to think about me a lot to do it. It's like that old wheeze about love and hate being the same. Before I forget it, Babe, the key, please. Quit howling like a banshee in the night, Jerry, you still love me. Wait a minute, I'll be right back. Susan. Oh, Jerry, you were splendid tonight, I knew you would be. Thanks. Susan... Will you come downstairs for a minute? Please, I want to talk to you. I want to ask you a question before the customary introduction. Yes, Jerry. I've been thinking of this for quite a while. Susan, do you remember the night we met? Yes, I... I asked you to stop making noises on that horn so I could work. And I heard music in your voice. And then we quarrelled and... I heard more music. Then I thought I could go back to Cristobal, but I couldn't because... ...when you left, the music went with you. Susan, will you marry me? Why, of course, Jerry. My fianc?e, Miss Susan Drake. - My wife, Miss Jerome Marvin. - We've already met. I wanted you to be the first to know, Babe. I think I approve. She's very lovely. Your approval makes my happiness complete. There's a great deal I could tell you about Jerry that would make things easier for you. But that would be taking the fun about it. May I wish you luck? Very much luck. Surprised, aren't you, Jerry? You didn't think I could lose gracefully. Well, I can. It hurts like the devil. Right now there's nothing in the world i want more than to be your wife. So I'd better get out of here while I'm still a lady. Thanks, Jerry. Do you mind if I go upstairs and get some of the personal things I left behind? - It's very little to ask. - No, I don't mind, go right ahead, Babe. I hope I said the right things, you wanted me to accept you, didn't you? That's why I asked you. Well, she'll probably leave you alone now. Though I couldn't help feeling sorry for her. Everybody feels sorry for Babe. You start out doing that and you wind up with everybody feeling sorry for you. Well, good night. Susan, I've been thinking of this for quite a while. Do you remember the first night we met? Yes, I wanted you to stop making noises on that h... I said that before. - I heard music in your voice. - Wait a minute, there's nobody's here with us now. Will you please give me the courtesy of not interrupting me? I heard music in your voice. We quarrelled and I heard more music. Then I thought I could go back to Cristobal, but I couldn't... ...because when you left, the music all went with you. Susan, will you marry me? Will you? I'll answer you the moment I stop crying. Well, I... I think it's only fair for you to know I'm a bad cook and I darn socks abominably. I'd stop eating and go barefoot, there isn't anything I wouldn't do. - Do you love me? - I'm just a little bit insane about you. If you wouldn't have asked me, I'd have asked you. You'd never have gotten away from me. Is that a nice way for a girl to talk? No, it isn't, you should be talking that way. Ooh... Ooh... Babe, are you hurt? Oh, please... ooh... - What happened? - I... I slipped. - Let me help you up. - Oh, my back! Something's happened. I don't think you'd better move her till we have a doctor. Dr. Mandel, please. I want you to tell me the truth. What's the matter with me? You're suffering from shock. Oh, nothing organically wrong. But shock can produce severe conditions. - And in your case... - It's my legs, isn't it? Only temporarily, Babe. Oh, gosh... A week, a month. A week? A month? I can't stay here. Jerry, this accident is my misfortune, not yours. - Babe, please. - What am I going to do? Oh, I'm so alone. Where am I going to go, Jerry? Oh, Jerry, I know I shouldn't stay here, but please. Please don't send me away. Let me stay here until I can pull myself together. Jerry, she'll have you for the rest of your life. Give me a little time. Babe, Babe, you mustn't excite yourself. Oh, I'm sorry. Please forget what I said. You'll feel much better in the morning after a good night's sleep. These belong to Mrs. Marvin. She dropped them on the steps. She'll need a nurse too. Jerry, please call Hattie. Hattie's my maid. She's better for me than any old hard-boiled nurse. All right, I'll call her. Is it okay with you, Frank? Okay. I'll leave her these sleeping tablets. Give her two of them. Yes, doctor. Good night, Mrs. Marvin. Good night. Good night, Babe, see you in the morning. - Jerry. - I'll make her comfortable. I don't suppose it'll make you feel any better if I told you how sorry I am. By all the rules, I should hate you. Well, if it will help, I wish you would. I'll try like the devil, Susan. - May I call you Susan? - Of course. - Is this too warm? - Yes, please. Leave that one on, please. Is there anything else you want before I go? Please don't leave me. I get the jitters lying here alone. I start to think and begin feeling sorry for myself. And there's nothing sorrier than Babe feeling sorry for herself. Poor Jerry, he always plays that way when he's upset. - Shall I ask him to stop? - On, no don't disturb him. It doesn't bother me. Jerry always said I was selfish and I guess I am. You're tired and sleepy and I make you sit here just the same. I don't mind. Please go to bed, I'd feel better if you did. I'll buzz if I need anything. Jerry's downstairs, he'll hear if I buzz. Where's the buzzer? There it is. Thank you, you've been very sweet. - Good night. - Good night. No, don't put on the light, Dad. - Healthy animal. - I wish I were more like him. Mind if I take you as you are? It's an awful mess, isn't it, Dad? - It could be worse. - It is. Jerry asked me to marry him and I accepted. Hm, it is worse. It was different before I knew her. Even now after I met her didn't make so much difference, but now... Not very sporting competing with a woman who is helpless. Dad, you know what I think. Certainly, that we'd better get out of here. Yes, we'd better get out of here. Because my heart and not my good sense is involved with Jerry. It keeps saying, don't go, you've got him to heck with all decency. So, I think I'd better go. Am I still your favorite daughter? Right this minute I'm so proud of you, I'd like to wake up Tom up... ...and give him a good thrashing for not being another girl like you. - Good night, Dad. - Good night, Susan. - Where are you going to sleep? - In the guest room. Oh, I forgot a robe and nightgown. Hate to disturb her, she's probably asleep. Oh... oh, I'm sorry. I thought you were asleep. - I forgot a nightie. - Oh, yes, this is your room. I'm sorry to put you out. I felt like the wreck of the Hesperus the minute I looked at you. I thought if I fixed myself up a little. Most women take their make-up off before going to bed. I make sure mine's on just right. Good night. Dad. - Dad. - What's the matter, what's the matter? - There's nothing wrong with her. - What? Mrs. Marvin the first can walk, she's a faker. What makes you say that? I put her bag with her lipstick and compact... ...on the dresser, twenty feet away from the bed. Nobody was in that room after I left. We were in this room, Jerry was downstairs, I could hear him playing. And when I went back in there, she was using the lipstick and compact. - But two doctors have examined her... - Yes, I know. I was there, I'll admit she has nerves, she didn't even flinch when they stuck pins in her. But just the same, she's pretending to be hurt so she can stay here. Susan, for that stupid, jealous remark, I'll report you to the Medical Association. They'll put pickets around the house. It's a serious accusation, Susan, are you sure? - I'm positive. - Have you told Jerry? No. I tried to, but I couldn't. I've got to prove it. How? I don't know, but I'll make her give herself away. She's a very clever girl, Susan, she's proven that. Well, if she had twice the cunning and three times the charm, I'd still expose her, and in front of Jerry too. Well, it's every woman for herself from now on. And I'm betting on you, Suzie Q. Get this one. There came to the music Hall tonight a man and his trumpet. And... Oh, this will warm the cockles of your trumpet's heart. - Jerry! - Huh? - This is your day to howl. - Tom! Oh, I'm sorry, I forgot for a minute. All your life I've tried to teach you to curb your tongue. Well, I suppose every man should be permitted one failure. And you are mine. Breakfast is ready whenever you wants it, Mr. Marvin. - We'll wait for Miss Drake. - Yes, sir. - Good morning, you're Hattie, aren't you? - Yessum. - Good morning, Jerry? - Good morning. How's the patient this morning? She seems to be fairly comfortable. Oh, don't be upset, she'll be all right. She'll be able to walk and before very long too. - I hope you're right. - I know it, dear, I know it. - Have you read Jerry's reviews? - No, are they good? Oh, let's have some breakfast first, I'm famished. Bring the papers along, we'll read them in here. Wow, what a night. To top everything else, our cook's sick this morning. - I'll get breakfast. - No, Hattie's got everything ready. Oh, how nice of her. - What would you like, eggs, bacon? - Can I have my coffee now, please? Yes, sir. Go on, Hattie, see what Mrs. Marvin wants, I'll get the coffee. - Oh, let me get it. - No, no, I'll get it. The little lady certainly requires a lot of attention, doesn't she? Oh, have you thought of any plan of getting her out of bed yet? Oh, I've thought of a thousand and one things, I tossed all night. - You don't look it. - This brightness came out of a compact. Something I learned from Babe. Say, why don't you sprinkle flour on the floor around her bed? Then, when she gets up, she leaves her footprints. Well, I've thought of sprinkling ground glass on her food. - What's wrong with that? - Children. Susan, I think you're being very unfair to Jerry not telling him what you suspect. But, Dad, I told you she... Did you read that the common cold costs the United States... ...five billion dollars in labor hours alone? And that's not adding in the cost of nose drops either. I hand't read that. - Thank you. - Hm-hmm. - I'll take it, Mr. Marvin. - Oh, thanks, Hattie. Buzz, buzz, buzz, I can't ever get a job done. Poor Hattie. That buzzer's been going ever since she got here. - I've got it, I've got it! - Hm? Got what? Uh... oh, the answer to that formula I've been working on. - You know what I mean, Dad. - Yes, I know. Will you excuse me, please? All of her ideas come to her just like that. Good morning, good morning, how's our patient this morning? A little better. Has anyone ever told you how beautiful you are? Oh, you're just trying to make me feel good. You have. Hattie, what are you doing? I'm trying to select a bed jacket. Susan, help me pick one. Oh, I think this one's very attractive. Hattie, the men are starving, you get breakfast, I'll help Miss Marvin. - Yessum. - Aren't you suppesed to be working... - ...at the university or something? - Yes, but... Oh, dear. I want to be where I do the most good. There, easy. Careful with your back. Oh... Hattie's really all I need. She always takes care of me. Oh, I imagine Harriet was very efficient when the care you needed was just routine. But this is an extraordinary occasion. I really don't mind keeping an eye on you. I don't want to keep you from your work. Don't you worry about that. This is just as big a job as smashing a few atoms. After all, we only pass through this life once and... any little kindness we can leave along the way should be... left along the way. There, now I'll have Hattie bring up your tray right away. What's up? - Where's Jerry? - In the kitchen. You must help me keep him and Hattie downstairs until the buzzer rings. - Why? - Well, it's very simple. She's always ringing for Hattie, isn't she? - Uh-huh. - What's that got to do with it? Well, I moved the buzzer just beyond her reach. Not far enough for her to become suspicious, just so far enough so that she'll have to get out of bed to ring. - So the next time she buzzes... - Is this my daughter Susan? My honest and honorable child, my sedate and dignified offspring? That I should live to see her degrade herself to... Are you sure the buzzer's far enough away from the bed? Positive. Really, Susan, you should read the reviews on Jerry's concert. Oh, I know they're good. They are, aren't they, darling? Sure, very good. Would you like to have me read them for you? Yes, please do, Tom, read them well and slowly, I want to hear every word. Hattie! "Tonight we heard Jerry Marvin tear away the civilized veneer of mental gymnastics. He said with music, here is a soul, base, human, vile and saintly in turn. - Good critic, he knows music. - Oh, Jerry, you're wonderful. Only in a conservative way. - The bell, it's a bell. - Yes, Susan. The telephone. What's so unusual about that? Uh... nothing. Only someone should answer it, that's why it's ringing, so someone will answer it. - I'll answer it. - Well, it might be important. It's the suspense that's killing me, why doesn't she ring? - Perhaps she can't walk. - Yes, she can! It's the laundry woman. Something about a missing shirt or something. Would you like to hear me read the rest of this review? Oh, yes, go through them all. And Jerry, you must start a clipping book. We'll put all the good ones in the front and the bad ones in the back. - Why put them in at all? - Is there anything else, ma'am? - No, thank you. - Then I'll take Mrs. Marvin's tray up now. Oh, do you mind if I check it? No, ma'am. Let me see, the mayonnaise cream, eggs, coffee. Oh, Hattie, no toast, you must prepare some toast immediately. But Mrs. Marvin never takes toast for breakfast, ma'am. You remember that, don't you, Mr. Marvin? - That's right, she never takes toast. - Oh, well, all right. Oh, Hattie, is the coffee hot? Oh... I'm sorry... it's my fault entirely. How clumsy, I seem so jittery this morning. Well, I'll go and explain to Mrs. Marvin. Hattie, you prepare another tray. Hattie, is that you? Hattie! She was sleeping like a little baby. Oh, you'll have plenty of time to fix another tray, - so would you get me some hot coffee? - Yes, ma'am. I'd like another cup of coffee too, please. Yes, sir. This is the best coffee we've had since the boat. I resent that. Oh, deep down inside you know you're no cook. The inside of me resents that. Jerry, they're trying to discourage you from marrying me. Sir, your daughter has informed me that she can neither sew nor cook. She's the soul of honesty. Oh, dear, dear, take deep breaths. How many times have I told you not to gulp? The buzzer. Mrs. Marvin rang. She wants her breakfast. - Hattie, I'll take Mrs. Marvin's tray. - Yes, ma'am, I'll get the coffee. - Come on, Jerry. - Oh, excuse us. - What's the hurry? - I have a little surprise for you. Let me take it. Come in! What happened to you? Oh, I thought it was Hattie. She was going to bring my coffee half an hour ago. It was my fault, I upset the first tray. - Why didn't you ring, dear? - I did. But how could you? Look where the bell is, you couldn't possibly reach it without get... Oh, I used this. Hattie should have known better than to put the table that far from you. I guess it was my fault, I... If you'll excuse me, I have a job I have to take care of... I'm terribly sorry, Dr. Hogarth. - I didn't mean to be late, but... - It's quite all right, Miss Drake. Your father called this morning and explained. Nasty fall. Mrs. Marvin is quite young, isn't she? I'd just like to start you out on isolating the lithium-6 atom, if you can do that. Dr. Hogarth, you once worked on nerve paralysis. Would you come out and examine Mrs. Marvin? Oh, my dear girl, the last patient I examined wore a bustle. Now, if we can isolate the lithium-6 atom, and then find a dye to carry it direct to the cancer tissue... But I'm sure if you looked at Mrs. Marvin... Oh, I think that the doctors called in on the case are very capable. Yes, they're all under seventy. I beg your pardon. Naturally I know paralysis can be subconsciously induced. But what are the chances of... well, of faking? Endless. I had a case once. Astonishing. Not even a quiver when jabbed with a pin. An astounding display of... of willpower. I tried all the scientifical methods. I even tried hypnotism. But the patient was too wily. I finally made him walk. I wonder if we took a solution both of lithium-6 and borom-10... How did you make him walk, what was the treatment? You won't repeat this because it wasn't quite ethical. - Of course not. - I got him drunk. Of course I had to drink with him. But I took aspirin to counteract the stimulant. He not only walked, he offered to fight John L. Sullivan. Thank you, Hattie, that's all. Look what I found, champagne. Where did you get that? I found it in the cupboard when I straightened them out. Thought we might have a little drink together. How nice. How about the others? Oh, Dad and Tom have gone to get Jerry. You like champagne, don't you? It's my favorite drink, it always makes me very gay. Oh, it's a pity I didn't think of it sooner. What shall we drink to? How about to us? - The old wife out, the new one in. - Oh, no, that's too cruel. Why? Why can't women be like men? They always drink to the last man to go. Come on, let's hoist a mug to the last woman to go. - Me. - All right, I'll drink to you, Babe. But I refuse to drink to your past. To your future. And the nice man you'll meet, and marry and live happily ever after with. There's just a slight technical reservation, Susan. Most men when they do their courting, like their women with the normal number of legs so they can dance. You'll dance, darling, I can see you in his arms now. - Ask him his name and address. - Can't you see him? You'd better have another drink... ...and you'll be clairvoyant too. Excuse me. This is good, it's very good. The more I drink of this, the more I see the long dreary years... ...stretching in front of me. Oh, your legs, your pretty legs. I'll wager the millions of men that saw them on the stage are weeping tonight. - What do you know about men? - Not much. - But I'm willing to learn. - They're all alike. Some are a little more housebroken than others. But they weep for no woman. Except Jerry. Let's drink to Jerry. To Jerry. Oh, I'm sorry I let my bitterness get the best of me. I know Jerry will never desert me. And neither will I, honey, neither will I. I'm going to stick to you until you can walk. You're so thoughtful, I just don't know what to say to you. Don't give it another thought, I know just how you feel. Let's have another drink. That's beautiful. You know, that music makes me want to dance. Doesn't it make you want to dance? Even if a wanted to, I couldn't. - I bet you were a beautiful dancer. - Thanks. I was pretty good. I'd like to see you dance. Just once. Do you think maybe you could? Just to please me. Some other time maybe. Oh, come on, there's nobody here to see you except me. Maybe if you had another drink, you would? - Good evening. - Good evening. - Mr. Marvin will be right in. - Yes, sir. - Where's Miss Drake? - She's upstairs with Mrs. Marvin. Is everything all right? Oh, yes, they're drinking champagne together. Champagne? It's all right. Susan's getting Mrs. Marvin drunk so she'll get up and walk. So that's why you dragged me out of the house. - Good heavens, Susan can't drink. - She's all right. She took 20 grains of aspirin, that'll counteract any alcoholic effect. - I suppose that was your brilliant idea. - No, it was Professor Hogarth. There's Jerry. - Good evening. - Good evening. - Where's Susan? - She's upstairs with Babe. Oh. Come on. Come on, it's easy. Just a few steps to please me. It's perfectly simple. Come in. You can do it if you want to. - Susan! - Shhh. Come on, get up. - You don't have to be coaxed. - Susan! She can walk, she can walk. - Susan, what are you talking about? - She wishes I could walk. - We've been talking about it this evening. - But you can walk. She's had a little too much champagne, I think. You'd better come along with me, darling. Darling, that's the first time you ever called me darling. Oh, hey, I'm going to carry you to your room. - Carry me? - Oh... - You want to carry me in your arms? - Uh-huh. All my life I've had to stand on my own two feet... ...and now you want to carry me in your arms. - Susan, what's happened? - She's just had a little too much champagne. - Hello, Dad. - You're intoxicated. No, I'm not, Dr. Hogarth said 20 grains of aspirin would make me immune to stimulants. She's drunk. I want some champagne. Something must have gone wrong. Close the door and call the doctor. Tell him to get here right away. So I can walk, can I? I'll fix her. Will somebody turn out that light? It's the setting sun, Susan. - It's late afternoon. - Of the following day. - Afternoon? - Uh-huh. Well, what happened to last night and this morning? Please answer that phone. Phone, what phone? Phone, what phone, the phone that's ringing. - There's no phone ringing, Susan. - Then turn off that burglar alarm. - Let me die in peace. - Now, darling. And don't shout at me. Nobody's shouting at you and there's no bell going. No bell going, I can hear it as clear as... Well, as clear as a bell. - It's all in your head. - Ooh! What head? I have no head. It's just a knot up there to keep my skin from unraveling. Well, it was worth it. I made her walk and Jerry was there to see it. But she didn't walk, Susan. And I don't believe she can walk. You've always been able to think clearly, Susan. Look at it through the eyes of others. You're in an unenviable position. You've been made love to by what is legally still a married man. Well, since it's I who am in the unenviable position, do you mind if I look at it through my own eyes? Susan. I don't care what anybody else thinks. I still think she's pretending. And I'm not going to give up trying. Jerry's going to take his wife to Georgia Hot Springs. What did you say? Dr. Cassell's orders. Says she seems to be too upset here emotionally. Must go away. - What did Jerry say? - What could he say? What could any decent man say under the circumstances? Behold, oh fairest of women, whither thy lover has gone. I've just come back from the same place, Jerry, it's ghastly. - You sure were stinking last night. - I'm so thoroughly ashamed. There's no need to be ashamed, I understood it perfectly. Did you, Jerry? Sure, I know the solaces brewed into a bottle. I'm the freat-grandfather of all unquenchable thirsts. How are you, granddaughter? Did I... did I say anything unseemly while I was... stinking? You kept insisting that Babe could walk. Did I? When I'm swacked, everything I want comes true too. - I remember once when I... - Let's fill it up. There are a lot of things I'd like to come true. Fill it up? You plagiarized that phrase from me. I remember the day I coined it, I was in Joe's barroom. I held out my glass and I said, "Fill it up, Joe, old boy." The phrase caught on like wildfire, it was translated into seven different languages. Hey, hey, that's whiskey, not champagne. What's good enough for you is good enough for me. For richer or poorer, in sickness or in health, sober or stinking. Susan... There's something I have to tell you. You don't have to tell me, I know. There's nothing else you can do. When are you leaving? Tomorrow morning. Well, it's nice traveling by daylight. You can see the scenery. I've never seen the South. You have, haven't you, Jerry? - Yeah. - Yes, Babe mentioned it once. Well, it's been very pleasant, Mr. Marvin. I'll be watching for you in the newsreels. I'll nudge the fellow next to me and I'll say, you see that man? We met on a boat. - Got to know each other rather well. - Shut up, shut up, shut up. We mustn't let our shipboard acquaintance end like all the others. Let's hear from each other once in a while. - I'll write every day. - What will you say? I'll say, Susan, dear... Well, for the same postage stamp you could make it a little stronger. I'll say, Susan, darling... Darling, darling, darling. I'll only be gone a week. A month at most. Maybe a year. A lifetime. - Oh, I was ringing for Hattie. - She's gone into town to pack your things. - I suppose you know we're leaving. - Yes. - Was there something you wanted? - Would you get me a cigarette, please? - Have one? - No, thank you. Light, please. You don't look well, Susan, you shouldn't drink. By the way, I forgot to thank you. If it wasn't for you picking up Jerry in Cristobal... ...and giving him a sense of decency, a conscience, he'd have walked out on me accident or no accident. While we're in the process of letting our hair down, why don't you admit that you can walk? Oh, I couldn't do that. You'd be taking an unfair advantage of me. You're so strong and intelligent. You've got college degrees and prize-winning scholarships. I've only got my weekness. I'm just a dumb helpless female with no one to lean on... ...but my husband. I've heard of women like you. You marry a man and play a game. Every word of yours, every look must bring so much in return. - What a dirty place you make this world. - Oh, you've got the wrong slant, Susan. This wedding ring is the emblem of virtue, darling. If you have it on your finger, you're always in the right. The other woman is... well. She's the other woman. In three months your divorce will be final. And you can pack that emblem away in mothballs. In three months I could spot you two of them and still make it. I week in Georgia Hot Springs after a few mineral baths. Some sunshine and away from emotional stress. With Jerry alongside of me. I'll be able to hobble around a little. And I can look very beautiful hobbling around a little. Naturally I'll tire very easily, but... Jerry, he's so sweet. He'll carry me up to my bed to rest awhile. And then... But don't be impolite and leave now, I'm not through. I'm a civilized individual with a firm stomach and a fair amount of manners. But there are times when a good case of seasickness is in order. Oh, good heavens! Operator! Operator! I want to report a fire. Yes, hurry, please. The fire is at 1746 Riverdale Drive. Come as quickly as you can. Oh, there you... - Quick, put this on. - What's the idea? The house is on fire, we've got to get out of here. - Oh, yeah, how did it start? - In my laboratory. In your laboratory. Why didn't you put it out? I tried to, it's too big a blaze. For heaven's sake, put this on! Why don't you call the fire department, they're paid to ut out fires. I have. We can't wait, you're going to get out of here if I have to pull you out! Go ahead. Drag an invalid out of bed. I'd make a very pathetic picture lying in a heap on the floor. All right... if that's the way you feel. Why should I quarrel with fate when she gives me one more chance? It won't work, Susan. First you put the call buzzer over there away from the bed. Then it's a few glasses of champagne to cheer me up. Now it's a fire. I can't walk, Susan, didn't you know? I've got shock. Two doctors said so. I've heard of people bedridden for years who in a situation like this... ...suddenly find they can not only walk, but run. Well, my shock is a special kind of shock. Only a miracle can cure it. And that'll take place at Georgia Hot Springs. What's that? Smoke. It usually accompanies fire. A few wet rags smouldering in a pale would make a lot of smoke. These old houses are like tinder boxes. Once they catch on fire, there's no putting them out. It can't be much of a fire, or you wouldn't still be here. Oh, I'm going to stay to see that you don't trip going down the stairs. - What's that out there? - The house is on fire, it's burning. It's getting warm, don't you think? Rats usually desert a sinking ship. It hasn't reached the staircase yet, you can make it if you hurry, but you've got to hurry. I'm a cripple, someone will have to carry me. There's nobody here, just you and me and the fire. How cozy. That fire isn't going to wait until you've had your mineral baths, your sunshine and freedom from mental stress. You won't let me burn. No. No, I won't let you burn. Come on. You can make it if you hurry. Susan! Susan! Jerry! You're very kind. Thanks anyway. Susan, Babe! Darling, are you all right? Jerry, thank heavens you're here. Don't be frightened, we'll have you out of here in a minute. Oh, Jerry, my back... - Go ahead, Susan! - Oh, my coat! My ermine coat! The house is burning around your ears and you're worrying about a fur coat. - Out the back way, Susan. - I'm coming. Oh, Jerry, your beautiful house. It's all right, Susan. It's only the left wing. Let me have that blanket, darling. - You'll be safe out here. - Oh... oh, my back, Jerry. I'm sorry. I'll call an ambulance to take you back to your apartment. Jerry, Susan set the house on fire. - What are you talking about? - She tried to burn me. Nonsense, you're hysterical. Now pull yourself together. She did, I tell you. She tried to burn me to death to prove I could walk. I don't know why she should hate me. She knows I wouldn't want to come deliberately between you and her. Babe, what kind of talk is this, Susan set fire to the house. She did it, she did, ask... You win, Babe. In every game somebody has to win, somebody has to lose. - You win. - Game? Say, what is this anyway? I'm sorry I caused all this trouble, Jerry. I'm sorry about the fire, I'm sorry about everything. Susan. Susan! Susan, it doesn't matter about the house, there wasn't much damage done. Anyway, it was insured... Look out for the water! You... you crazy fool! What are you trying to do? Babe, you were standing. Yes... isn't it wonderful? The doctor said only a miracle would do it. Yes, it is wonderful. - Try it again. - Oh, I don't think I could do it, Jerry. Sure you can, come on. You think I can? - All right, for you, Jerry. - Yes, just for me. That's it. - Now walk over to me. - Walk? Sure, come on. That's it. Now another step. That's fine! Come on, Babe. Come on. You little fraud! Well, you can't blame a girl for trying! You've had this coming to you for years! - Let me go! - Jerry! Jerry! Oh a gentleman can't strike a lady. - But I can! - Susan, don't you dare now! Susan! Stop it! - Subtitles - Lu?s Filipe Bernardes
