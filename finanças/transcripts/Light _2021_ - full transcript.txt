Pressing on with leaden feet Shackled, like how lovers are Waiting for those helping hands but inevitably, the tears come falling down la, la, la, la, la, I long for freedom la, la, la, la, la, as broken as I am If only I could run away from it all and fly towards the light How do you mend a broken heart with no difference between night and day My eyes are shut as I gently call out who are you la, la, la, la, la, I long for freedom la, la, la, la, la, as broken as I am A pair of eyes taken by darkness A pair of hands never to be held I’m black and blue, defined by insignificance I’m a mere speck of dust, so why me If only I can run away from it all and fly towards the light How do you mend a broken heart with no difference between night and day If only I can run away from this wasteland and fly high towards the light It is as if I’m stuck between the light and dark waiting to be seen, to be known until you came along and showed me who I am la, la, la, la, la, I long for freedom la, la, la, la, la, as broken as I am la, la, la, la, la, I long for freedom la, la, la, la, la, as broken as I am
