First cold. Then pain. Birth pain. Then I realized my energy cell was running out unusually fast. So fast that there was only time enough for my short life to flash in front of my eyes. EDIT AND I "I keep my fingers crossed. Broni" Good morning, Belgrade. May 20th 2074 dawned on us. Maybe not as we would like it, however, what is a morning drizzle compared to yesterday?s cloudburst. However... Belgrade?s Weather Bureau informs us that today's temperature will range from 62,2 to 73,4F. Air pressure is 990 millibars, humidity 75 percent. As Dusko Radovic would say "Mays used to be beautiful, blue and healthy and these are some modern Mays. We must wait for that mode to pass, like any other... However, it's a pity we are losing so much beautiful weather'.' It's sad, Miss Stefanovic. If I hadn't cried so much because of the previous student, I'd let a tear or two fall for you, too. Next! Don't say you're crying because of the exam. - Otomo has died. No... How? He picked up some radio virus. Just started singing some Arabic song and then fell. Just like bots in my brother's company. Yes, just that he can format them, as he likes, and I could only go to bot-graveyard and bury him. You didn't? You are sick... Even weather was right for my little morbid excursion. I even made a little gravestone. OTOMO Everyone said you weren't alive They are finally right This one rules. - I knew you like it. Look at this one. - And you get this for only 30 dinars? No, this is for real players. 50 dinars. -Listen Woo... I have nothing against plastic but sometimes you have to make out with some real meat. There is no difference. She doesn't eat, go to cinema, make you meet her parents, she's not a bitch in her PMS. And leaves huge emptiness when you come. That's if you?re a romantic fool that wastes energy on emotions. If your job satisfies you enough, this is like electrical massager. Who goes to live music events, when you can listen to a dynamic recording on a disc? - Mostly guys that are not screwing plastic dolls. - Speaking of dolls... You can tell she has aced it. Look how cheerful she is. Should I order a doll for you, too? You obviously don't know me. This is a real challenge for me. And if I fail, I can always tease her about the exam. I won't join you two in that exercise. - Why? It is too stressed for someone used to a partner that only tells him she loves him and he's the best in you know what. Bye. - Bye. Promise not to make me laugh and I'll drive you home. Just before you start, you should know Otomo has died. Then I suggest we go silently to your place and then to our separate ways without unnecessary intimacy. Great plan. You thought of it all by yourself? Experience, my dear. Teddy, you told me you ask grandpa for money today. You should never trust a bear that smokes filterless 'Drina'. Teddy, you don't smoke. - What, you don't trust me? Sir, could you give me your social security number? Give you what? - Social security number. For the exam and all. - God! This robo-rabbit of hers is asking for my social security number to sign up for the exam. She has flunked it again. When I ask her how it was she'll say she aced it! I would be the only human in line to sign up for the exam. How did she turn out to be such a liar? - Like Tarzan. He that will lie, will steal... She'll end up in prison. Now that you mention stealing, this morning they caught your ex again stealing high voltage tablets. My former husband is an artist of a French origin. What do these electro-workers know? Edit is a psychologist, too. - That doesn't count. What is one failed exam compared to the avalanche of knowledge she is ready to tackle. - Avalanche! Give money to the rabbit to pay for her exam. You don't talk about your new job. - TDR? Not bad. I think that I got in because grandpa pulled some strings, although he says he didn't. I don't really know what my job is. But they are pleased I am majoring in psychology, have communication skills and that I am good looking. - Good looking? What are you doing there? - Taking care of an autistic boy. Changing his diapers? - No, we talk... More precisely, I talk. He never does. We take a walk in the park and I try to reach him... Make him say something. - Like what? - I don't know. They just told me that he is a mathematical prodigy. I just hope that he is not that confused to ask you to extract his pants. - I knew it. I should have taken a bus. I'm home! You're here, honey. How was it? - I passed. You passed... And what about grade? - I've got a B. - B... You fatherfucking liar! Don't think I don't know you didn't pass the exam! At least learn to lie! Am I feeding you for that? And providing for you so that you can fool around? Teddy, I told you. You should have asked him. Of course you didn't pass the fucking exam when you are always out with those junkies... - Sophia, honey... Your show is on. - The show is on, you say? Wait... Why is the image like this? They can't ruin my show. Today's episode is important. Enrique is dead, our love is finally free. Pedro, wait, there is something you must know... I am a robot. My heart is made of metal. Maria, I also have a confession to make... I am in fact an alien, I don't even have a heart. Pedro... - Maria... She's so naive... Don't trust him, honey. Bunny, Teddy... Please pick up these posters so that we don't tread on them. But your posters' tube is not here. That idiot Bojan hasn't returned it yet. Look, doc, it is like this... - Now we are on a look doc basis! If you do as you have promised, we'll stay there. You shouldn't get too intimate with me. You are not really my type. - Young man... Show some respect both to my age and my work, whose boundaries you couldn't even imagine. - Listen doc... Can you imagine boundaries of Meta Group's funds? You could try, it is not that complicated. You squeeze the Group, they squeeze me and I squeeze you. That's a lot of squeezing. Like the prom night. Until someone gives in. - I still think this thing is between the Meta Group and me. - The thing between you and the Group is called Sergey and you're looking at him. And fortunately, unlike me, Meta Group can imagine boundaries of your work, but not for long. They need something solid. Tell them that this time we have concrete plan. A girl, Edit Stefanovic, will... - Edit Stefanovic? - New intern. I think she will be able to reach Abel. She has all relevant qualities. She is resourceful, has excellent knowledge of psychology and she's capable of split second reactions. What are you doing? If professor is making passes at you, you better use it. Just stroke his monkey and one exam less. Two months of work gone. Bojan, am I right? You'd do a little muff diving to pass an exam? - Naturally. Smart man, the line of least resistance. - Thanks. Higher education reform should be based on your method. Oral educational method... It would be interesting to be a professor. Will you come to pick this up? - I intended to. It is not moral, but it's more so than the oral method. Oral morals... I'll drive you to Herb and go home. I have work to do. - You are still writing the book? That is my therapy. I'll do it for the rest of my life. Does that mean that one day I will be with a rich writer? Or with a serial killer. Don't forget the initial capital letter in sentence. I'm glad to see you are better. - That's two of us. You shake it, exhale, press here and then inhale, hold it for three seconds, exhale and that is it. Press, exhale, shake and then I count, and... Press, inhale, hold it for three seconds and exhale! I press, inhale... How long should I hold? Hold your breath for five minutes. Maybe you'll survive. Scram. Next customer. Damn technology. What was wrong with swallow it and end of story? - That's right, swallow it. Hi. - Hi. - Bye. 25 dinars. Return it in 2 weeks. - Three. - Ok, three. Take off your clothes. Implanting is five more dinars or you could go and wait at the public ambulance. - Ok. Hit me! Why the fuck are you screaming? - You said it wouldn't hurt! It wouldn't if you drank brandy. She is bleeding all over your carpet. - Fuck! Chip searches and automatically recognizes the nerve by the structure of its impulses and then presto! Look, it has even automatically bandaged your arm. What now? - That's it. - That's it? Read this small paragraph here. And then his large penis... What's this? - Keep reading. Moki, pass a smoke! - It's gone, man... What do you mean gone? I gave you the whole damn bong! There were just four hits. - What do you mean four? There was a whole corn. Where did all this fog come from? Ok, I'll make more. - I don't have more. Are you a dealer or... - No, I am Weissmuller. I haven't told you to read the whole thing. Now... What is the 24th letter that you have read? How should I know? Ryto remember. E! - E... If someone saw you lying there in the grass, watching clouds, one'd think you're really enjoying it. But you are not really well, are you? Your pupils are moving pretty fast. What are you counting? You won't tell me? Never mind, I probably wouldn't understand. My head is full with modulars and modular models. Whole next month I'll be stupid for everything else. Don't answer it! - You speak... What did you just say? Say it. Hello... Professor, Abel has spoken. - What? Yes, right now! But what is really strange, it seemed like he knew that phone was about to ring. Like he can predicts future, and wanted to warn me. What's going on, professor? You owe me an explanation. OK, follow me. Professor, what is this? Look, what we are doing here is a state secret. Abel Mustafov was a mathematical prodigy that has made the greatest breakthrough ever in universal theory research. That is theory that defines interconnectedness of all energies found on earth. Experts have been trying to find this formula for centuries. It's believed to be the formula of the all-encompassing energy. Direct line to God. One day something happened to Abel. We believe that he has figured it out. But what does happen to a man that discovers fundamental truths about life and universe? He becomes autistic and disinterested. Based on his notes we managed to reconstruct part of the formula. We also used research methods used on unborn babies. When we put all that together, we got the graph of this formula. We believe that formula itself is complete, but we don't know how it works. What you saw upstairs is not a coffee machine. It's one of the most powerful computers in the world. It is useless with these calculations. An incredible phenomenon occurs during calculations. Computing software falls into what we call 'algorithm absurd'. It becomes self-aware, alive, and then it simply shuts down. This is why we need to communicate with Abel. You said that Abel could see future. That is also true. All the time his brain, almost as a reflex, uses this formula to calculate, based on parameters still unknown to us, all the points on the graph that forms an image of future in the end. But to cut it short, one image is worth a thousand words. You'll see the graph and everything will be clearer. Because this is an unique graph, its spatial coordinates and temporal function are in mass and color as an audio function. You must see it in a special neuro-perceptive technique. Edit, I don't have to tell you that everything that you've seen here is secret, to ensure our safety. That was a picture impossible to draw. Something like optic art, shimmering lines that trick the eye and form various shapes that seem familiar but you don't know where from. I don't know... Left, you jerk! I'll call my children! Let me go! Wonderful, and you say that happened to whom? I felt so stupid. She didn't understand how important that was for me. Why didn't you tell that to someone else? - I did... That's just like my new earrings... Now you see them, now you don't. Now you see them, now you don't. Interesting, but you'll feel the same if you take two OPLs. That is the worst excuse for not having sex ever. Don't you understand I stood in front of it weeping with joy? Come here and you'll also weep with joy. - Stupid prick! All right, I tried nicely. - No, I have to study! You lunatic, how could you do that? Meta Group would understand! - Understand what? That a broad is wandering around city telling everybody what is going on in a state company that should be conducting social research! We gave you millions so that you could gamble with them now! - You do not understand. She is now closer to the answer then we ever were! It better be that way! In any case, she will be under special surveillance and your clock is ticking! Do you ever clean your nose? Get in. - No way, let's go. - I have to get dressed you fool. Your folks don't like me. I don't want to come in. Be in grandpa's room. I'll be done in two minutes. Good evening. - Grandpa, this is Bojan. Bojan, grandpa. Good evening. - I'll be back in a minute. Don't sit on that chair! There is a strange story about that chair. I remember as if it was yesterday. It was on 5th October 2000. I think of that day with tears in my eyes. Shouting, screaming all around. First police is hitting us, then we are hitting police, then the bulldozer, then the Molotovs, fire, smoke, tear gas... I just remember I have found myself in the Parliament. People were shouting and running. I started running down the hall looking for something to take as a trophy of this great victory. I burst into a room on the first floor. I was reaching for a painting when I felt a presence... I glanced around and saw Misko! - Who? - Slobodan Milosevic. I also thought it strange that he is not in some bunker or on a private island. I am looking at him and he is looking at me. Suddenly, a tentacle sprouts from his forehead. I was petrified, not believing. Tentacle is growing longer and slowly it takes shape of an eight-legged beast. When its tail was free from his head it started jumping around the room, bouncing from wall to wall like lightning until it went into the Coat of Arms of the Republic of Serbia. In that moment he became aware of my presence and quickly ran through a secret door behind him. Then I heard a noise behind me. People were entering this room too. I just grabbed the chair he was sitting on and I ran away. And that is the story of that chair. But this is a garden chair. - You mean that one... You can sit into that one. It's from the flea market. - Move. We are meeting Broni in five minutes. Is that my son in law? - Good evening. Please not now, we are in a hurry. - That's ok. I just hope that there is no hurry in bedroom. Mum, we already... - I know. But when you drop it who will rock the cradle? - You mean that? Don't worry. Bojan is a girl. - What? - What? He went to a hospital and told them that he would love to have you know, instead of, you know. What? - Bye! - Tell me what! Tell me what! Are you insane? That woman will never speak to me again! Wasn't that what you wanted? - Notes for the novel, June 12th. Edit insane. Cause inherited. Bravo, Miss Stefanovic, nice surprise indeed. I will be glad to give you the highest mark. And all thanks to Herb's chip. Too bad I didn't know about this little wonder when I started my studies. Now it should be taken out, I mean, I was just on my way to Herb to get it out but for some reason I stopped here first. What? You let that moron grab your tits? You don't understand. That was what professor was expecting. I hope he doesn't expect you to lay down with financiers. You stupid fuck, that boy has been alone for 15 years. I'm the first that has succeeded in approaching him a little and discovering another side of him. Beside autistic side. And what if he discovers another side of your personality? I'll give it to him. What a fuck, that is my job description. You slut... - Your daddy is a slut. It was on the wall, I could see it, really... But take that shit out now. Yes, I have passed the exam, but I am too much confused since you put that thing in. This is going to hurt a little, but please do not scream. You'll upset Moki. - Last time I got painkillers. Of course. I have plum painkillers. I have peach painkillers, but I also have iron pills. You want that? - Even better. Here it is... Fuck, don't scream! It's all right, Moki! I can't believe what she's doing to herself. She has been acting weird. And that job at the TDR... That's true, and that thing with green salad and liver. For the last few weeks that is all she has been eating. She craves iron, she says. - Iron? - She has been ordering beet in cafe. - Don't mention iron. You cannot imagine what she has done two days ago at the Sound Arena. Edit, is everything OK? - Never been better. Try this. This stuff really blows you away. - This is iron! - Yes. Here are six. - Give me twelve. - You gulp down six of these and you feel great! - I really like you so this is on me. You take three of those and it is terrific. - Give me! What's up? - That stuff was so good that we came for more. Yes, I was so happy that I puked. She poisoned us with those pills. Yes, and she tells me she has hallucinations. But never mind. It is important that she had passed that exam. She even wants to take us for a game at the hover dome. No kidding... That?s very nice of her. Who's going? - Herb, Woo, Sanja, you, her and me. Dream team. Yeah... It's been almost six months since we have been there. You remember how it was? They carried us out... Goal for each team is to be first one to reach the switch. The first player pressing the switch opens the appropriate door. There are 4 switches. The winner is the team that finishes first after three laps. Ok, I choose Herb and Broni. Bojan, Woo and Sanja are the other team. Of course, since I am paying for all this I think that my team should win. - Dream on. Why engage in extreme sports when we can extremely drink and smoke? Winners also pay for bandages. - Losers? mamas are bold. Has someone noticed that I have matching hover board and pants? - No. That I have matching hover board and pants? - No. Look at them. They come here, do drugs, they play the 'Gate' and get themselves killed. Same last week. We had to scrape them from walls with a toothbrush. All junkies. Junkies. We have them here. I will push Bojan to the right, and you activate number three! - Roger! You are really not normal. He was wearing a gray coat, white beard and hair... I cannot believe that you haven't seen the idiot on tracks. If it weren't for that you would've gone to three and plastered yourself all over it. You are right. And you would be paying for this liquid sound. Yeah, right. Boki, you could buy that round you promised. Kiss my ass. Fucking digital smokes... I don't know what to tell you, you know. Money is short and I can't make ends meet. My Jemalia and Suzana and Moebius don't work. These new robots and rest of hardware... - Daddy! - Silence, Moebius! And rest of hardware... - Daddy! - Silence, Moebius! Daddy is giving an interview. - The horse has shat! They're fucking around with us, taking our jobs... I'm taking you to a terrific place. You are so down lately. Why don't you... And what are you doing taking pills all the time? Fuck, I like them. I suppose I am anemic. I don't feel my legs and arms lately... Could it be malnourishment? - Whatever. Do you know for Data-date? - Don't. It's sexoholics anonymous out there. - It is OK. Think of it as a cyber masked ball. And when they take off the masks? Geeks and pimples all around. That place is a little shop of inadequacy complexes. I know, but tonight I have a date with a 'butterfly queen'. Your boyfriend pushed me into this. He said: 'How long do you plan on screwing plastics? ' Where? - Inside. - Invitation? What invitation? - In leather, bro! I don't have one. - Than take this one home. She seems doable. - Listen, man, could we arrange something? Buzz off, all of you immediately go for a wallet. You think it's all about money. No, dude... Ideals should push us forward, not dependence on things. Do not search for Identity in brands but inside you! And express it not through jerking off inside a Porsche, but in Art for example! - You are an artist? - Yes. Poet... Can we hear something? - Let's see... 'Innocent bite succumbs to falling. Will anyone hear a plea from acid Rectum bubbles satisfied. I don't need this. Why doesn't it start? What is this, my face? Help! Edit... - Hello. What are you doing here? - I am here with a friend. Aren't you dating Bojan? - I am here with a friend. It is not a problem for you. Everybody is hitting on you. I am here with a fr... Who's hitting on me? You haven't been to Faculty? - No. - In some mysterious way professor Grkinic succeeded in losing your test. You should check in to do it again. But alone, in his office. Wait a minute, leave all metal objects you have. Everything is here. I don't have anything else. - Alright. Now we will see... You love it when it hurts, baby. - What? - That is just jewelry. Screw you, looser! - Alarm, get her! She has the bomb, alarm! I was afraid I am not mad enough! Baby... My pal says that you have some jewelry in your panties. Get her! Damn... Come in. Professor, are you free? - Edit, of course. Just get in. There was an unforeseen problem, but we should finish very fast. Yes, I read the notice on board, and I feel that there is no need for these ciphers. You know that I like you too. I am sure my knowledge was satisfactory, as this will be. Professor, there is a girl... Fuck. Professor, maybe it would be better if I go. Yes... Everything is... Great! I can't believe. You were ready to kiss him? Long kiss goodbye. Both from his family and his career. Either that or to let me pass the exam... With compliments. - You think he would agree to that? He is tricky. - He would. I made couple of shots while I was unzipping him. I don't think his wife would love that. You want to see it? I think you won't like it too much. Miss... Please leave all metal objects you are carrying. I have this one. This one, too. Wait. No... I have that one. Who's that? Hallo? - You have to take me to this private clinic. Sanja's friend is working there. - I have some business with Woo. Probably another chapter in a debate 'Plastic or meat'. I think that plastic is the right answer. Drive, you idiot... - Something is wrong. Maybe I ate something metal. - Chocolate wrapping isn't edible. You know that? - I appreciate your efforts to cheer me up, but now I need concentration. Let me see... Search engine, 'Kojekude com'. Medical institutions, clinics... B... Bioklinik, that's it. Jurija Gagarina 42. You are searching wrong town. Relax and breathe deeply... Like that. You see anything, doctor? Doctor... Doctor... What's that? I don't know. - How can you not know? You are a doctor. - Yes, but... You need a mechanic, not a doctor. And what did she say? - You don't need a mechanic. How do you know that? - What? She must have said something. I was inside, too. - When? - Now! But I haven't seen you. - Where? - I know. How? - What? - Shut the fuck up! I'm talking! With the coffee machine? - No, with hi... I cannot... - I cannot touch you, either. Ghost! - Ghost? - Yes, ghost, run! What did they do now? - They probably didn't want to pay. He's probably some poor guy that died thanks to malpractice and now haunts the clinic. - I am not a ghost! Ghost! - You cow, I am not a ghost! You are not? - No, I am not. Enter here. I'll explain everything. Don't think I'm not confused. This is new for me too, but still I know little more than you. But still I know little more than you. Then start, since this is a little bit creepy. This better be convincing and simple... Because all those hallucinations... I'm sorry to interrupt but first you sprinted from the clinic and then you hid behind car and then you ran again, and now you are talking with a garbage can? Only you can see me. Bojan went there. Ok, then I'll see you later. Bye. You called me? - Welcome, Sergey. I have something that will interest you. Two hours ago we got this shots via Undernet. - What's that? - Full body scan of the Priority 4 person, Edit Stefanovic. I am not sure what happened. I just remember... Seeing, feeling. Everything was indistinguishable group of stimuli at first and then I started to slowly systemize. I connected verbs to audio and tactile sensations. I was memorizing faces and their names as well as all other things surrounding you. As well as all other things surrounding you. By listening, I learnt language and laws of your world. Only thing I didn't know was who or what I am. From time to time I would try to move but you probably just felt it like slight tingle in your limbs. Good. I was afraid I have heart condition and in fact I was going schizophrenic. - You were not. I have material existence. I found out that when you did. That is why I decided to try to communicate with you, both visually and audibly. - We communicated visually? - Yes. Both visually and audibly. - We communicated visually? - Yes. The guy on the hover dome track. That was me. Also the one that passed by when faculty security was chasing you. Just before I started controlling your limbs. Controlling? What did you do to me? What you saw on the scan is my body, metal nervous system. Identical to yours. As your brain can order an arm to rise, so can I. First time I could only make you go suddenly to the left. In the fight with the security I controlled your whole body. The most important thing for me is that I started controlling your metabolism. Thanks to me your system could stomach all those pills of iron and small bits of metal you swallowed. - Wait. How did you end up in me and how can you be alive when you say you are made of metal? I have no idea. - Tell me what's the first thing you remember. Everything started with an image. Multitude of lines intertwined into some impossible shape. Abel's graph chart! What is this? - You can clearly see from this scan that Miss Stefanovic had a chip removed from the left forearm. Considering that it was connected with the cerebral alpha nerve, implanted chip was probably TGA-11, military chip that has also shown good results in treatment of schizophrenia. It's also used by students to cheat at tests. God knows where they get them. Interesting part is on these micro scans. Where there were chip's jumpers, there are small plates now. When we analyzed them we noticed unusual imitation of circuits existing inTGA-11 chip. I know this sounds incredible, but somehow chip started to multiply like a cell. From the plates are sprouting micro conductors, only several molecules thin, made from some unknown metal with cluster of small balls on each 222 millimeters, like nodes, that also have started to sprout micro-conductors. You can see here that these micro-conductors have grown so much that now they trigger metal detectors. They reach the tips of fingers as well as the sensory organs and most importantly, the spine and the brain. Conductors on organs end in small sensors grouped in the same way as nerves on the respective human organ, eye, nose, tongue, ear or finger. Chip has developed its nervous system parallel to host's. That chip is alive. - Exactly. The same thing happened to our computers when they worked on Abel's formula. For some reason our software fell into 'algorithm absurd' and shut down, while this chip started developing some qualities of a living being. - Because it found consciousness. Yes, Edit's subconscious. - This is wonderful. Now we have the machine that could calculate Abel's formula. Now I like the way you are thinking, professor. But you cannot do that! What will happen to Edit? What is one sacrifice compared to the benefits it will bring to the whole society? Can you imagine ways in which predicting future could help us avoid any conflict? Think of thousands and thousands who will live thanks to this. Have no fear, professor, the Group will see to that you are in no way connected with her disappearance. Professor, her capture won't be that easy. You're the one who fights like crazy? You want me to fight you like crazy? - Please do. That was the best man from Sergey's team. What you just saw happened half an hour ago. We checked. Edit never trained any martial arts. Are you there? Can you hear me? - Of course I am here. I am always where you are. - You are making me eat all those iron pills? - Yes. - But why? I already told you I'm alive and I can also hunger. Iron is my food. - Food? Do you want to say that you eat? You have mouth? Edit, is everything OK? - Of course I don't have mouth, but I grow, just like all living beings, and to grow I must make you take pills and iron bits. How can you make me? - By controlling your hypophysis. Every time you take certain amount of iron I release certain quantity of endorphin, which makes you feel wonderful. And if I stopped doing that? - It would be very hard for you. You would die from lack of iron in your blood. I need you well and alive. I can kill viruses in your body very precisely. Bit by bit. And I can also... I feel your... What are you doing? - You don't feel me. I am just creating a sensation that you feel me. As I can create this sensation too. That was the last time we saw her. Yes, that was two days ago. - What is happening to her now? Nothing. She tells me that she is depressed and that she would like to be left alone. Yes, now she has new buddies. Garbage can and coffee machine. She is so far in the left field that she is in the locker room. You try to eat all that iron and stay normal. Now I will have to use magnet to drag her to bed. What's this? - Iron pills. Why do you need them? - I am sick. There are a lot more where I found these. - I am very sick. You could shit horseshoes with all the iron you ate! Why are you rummaging through my stuff? - Because I don't want to find out you are junkie when you're found dead in a basement! What are you talking about? - I know everything! I'm not blind. Look at you! Get out! - You have no idea. - Shut up! You are junkie! You lazy dope head... Am I lying now? What's this? I didn't know you're so tough. - I am not. Stop this bleeding or I will faint. This hurts! That woman can drive me crazy like no one can. How's that you are image of my subconscious and you are male? - I have no idea. You tell me. Who knows what kind of latent personalities are hiding in you. And why do you look like that? First, that is also some sort of an echo of your subconscious, and second, I have no idea how do I look. I can't read thoughts and I don't have a mirror. I can draw you. Then you would see through my eyes. But I am not really skilled at drawing. - It is not a problem. Just like you can fight like Bruce Lee, you can also draw like... - Bruce Lee? - Yes. I could try to guess in whose image you created me. Did you have some sort of sexual encounter as a small girl? Sexual encounter? - Subconscious is usually determined by the events from early childhood, and since I am a male I could venture a guess that you either fought or played 'visit the doctor' with someone who looks like me. One mystery less. I don't believe it. I have totally forgotten about that. Here you are now. And he is still wandering through the channels of your subconscious after all those years. This is why you are probably a little bit hypochondriac. You remember that once visit to the doctor was really interesting. - Please, shut up. It is finished. You were right. It turned out pretty good. I am handsome. Just name me, so that I can be a complete person. I ought to give you much more in order for you to be complete. Start with a name. - Let it be... Edi. - Be a little more creative. We are different after all. Not that much. Edi is OK. And we have to go ashore. I work from three o'clock, and professor wanted to see me. If I were you, I wouldn't expose myself so much out there. I know you wouldn't, but still, I have other plans! Nothing personal, but guests shouldn't overstay their welcome. Good afternoon, Edit. Come in. Sit down. A drink? - No, thanks. - I wanted to talk. Great, I wanted to talk with you, too. About metal entity in your body? - You know? - Yes. That is what I wanted to talk about. We know everything. We know about the chip you used to cheat, about parallel nervous system made from an unknown metal alloy, iron pills and audio-visual sensations caused by the entity you charmingly named Edi. And we can help you. - Yes? Our microsurgery is advanced enough to complete the operation. That machine in your body is what we need. Machine capable of solving Abel's formula that is alive and can overcome 'algorithm absurd'. I don't want to be a calculator. - What? I don't want to be calculator for the rest of my days. Your problem. - I think that is also your problem since you do not stand a chance of surviving that procedure. How do you know that? - If you don't believe me, ask your good friend Abel. He sees future. - That is right. Professor, immediately call Abel to come. - Of course. Please bring Abel to my office. Welcome, Abel. Sit down. Abele, Edit would like to ask you something. - Abel... Professor will send me for an operation. Will I survive it? No. A week later they will kill me as well. A miracle happened to you that needs to have its purpose which is to create a much better place from this world. It would be a pity to miss chance to overcome the future. Don't listen to his bullshit. Run! Think about victims of terrorism, traffic accidents, floods. All of these can be prevented Only with Abel's formula and that entity that is capable of calculating it. Edit, I... - I know, professor. Suspect is fleeing across level 3. Suspect is leaving the building. - Let's go, move! It is vital to capture the suspect alive. Use NNs! Shit! Suspect is on coordinate 7R-72V. She moves towards highway. Vehicle AP4, roger... Maintain your positions, please. The hyper-highway begins in 30 seconds. I don't want to frighten you but hyper-highway begins in a mile. That's what I want. They won't follow me there. -Of course. They don't want to die and neither do I. You just keep our eyes open. Hyper-highway begins in 10 seconds. Is it wise to charge into trucks driving at 250 miles per hour? The question is how do I get out of there. - OK then. Hyper-highway begins. Have a nice trip. What now? I think we got away. - Great. Now get me out of here. - Me? No, my grandma. A friend of mine asks me why his car doesn't work... Is someone following you? - What? - I don't know. Help me. They're chasing me. - What mess did you get yourself this time? - No mess, I swear. I was set up by this TDR guys. I barely escaped. - What do you mean 'I escaped'? They're tracing you by satellite. They can see if you have lice. They could if I haven't disabled my ID chip. - I cannot believe! That could be only done by... - Bold Jack from Bezanija! Listen, we have to go back to enemy stronghold tonight. Are you crazy? I have to risk my life for some loony that groped my girlfriend's tits? - Yeah, risk our lives... He groped your tits? - Abel saved my life and I owe him that much. And were you kissing, too? - We'll be done in 10 minutes. It'd be best we reacted right now and caught them off guard. And then what? - I already arranged it with Sanja. I'll be on her raft on Ada Ciganlija. We'll meet at the TDR parking space exactly at 20h. I'll enter when they are changing guards. I'll open backdoor. Broni will keep watch on the first floor while Bojan and I proceed to Abel's room on the second floor. We'll plant small decoders on security cameras. That'll give us 3 and half minutes to finish all. We'll pass security area 2 using the pass I stole from professor. Finally, there is a coded lock on Abel's door. I'll open the door using Herb's logical picklock. Bojan... Hold the door in order not to close and to fool sensor lenses so that it looks like no one has entered the room. Where is Abel? - He is in Kosutnjak building. Just like every Thursday. - Thursday! What? You planned everything except for the fact that it is Thursday? Crazy fuck... You are really insane. - Never mind, we'll do the same there if we hurry. - What are you babbling about? There are so much cops out there right now as if Santa Claus is giving away gifts. You burry your own shit! - I have to go meet Woo. What a building and elevator is not working. Bojan, now I feel bad for not helping her. - What? We've helped her understand that she is an idiot. What's up, ninja? Look who is waiting for you! You are here. Let me introduce you to Abel. Bojan, you were right. Santa Claus was there. He even sent gifts for you. - Gifts, great. It says 'Broni' here, it's for me? - Very perceptive. Look, cast replica of Ron Jeremy's penis. Now I can go fuck myself, right? - I got paper tube. To shove it in my ass? - In fact, so that you can return mine, but your idea is even better. - You better take this one. Who knows what he did with your. - Youth is always fooling around. But please someone tell me what we will do with Abel. He can stay at my raft but someone should stay with him. You're right, I'll stay with him and you will rotate. Good afternoon, madam. State security. Is Edit Stefanovic at home? - No. - Do you mind us taking a look around her room? - What if I do mind? We could charge you for aiding and abetting. Then take a look. - Thank you. I knew she was pushing drugs. Stupid cow. Edit, I'd like to ask you something. First you ate double salad, then half a kilo of liver, then a fistful of iron pills, then your phone... You must be really hungry. - It's not me. It's him. That thing in you? - Yes, him. He is growing inside me, occupies space and wants more and more food. I'll give it to him. If not I would die. -What do you say we go to 'Cyber Toys'. That takes you out of depression every time. I need someone to take depression out of me. Why did I do it? Edi... What did I realize? What day is today? Why don't you say it already? - What? You know what. What we have been avoiding all this time? - That. Edit... You'll die soon. Damn you! - Why me? When you'll realize that I'm not here of my own free will? Why don't you let me try the operation? You are clutching at a straw. - That is called will to live. That is called despair. You know you wouldn't survive. Abel told you that. - Liar! You are covering your ass. There is no mine and your ass here. It is our ass. Look at that this way. You got sick and died. What now? She ran away and there is no way to locate her? Yes, she has disabled ID chip. - That is true... But she won't be able to run for much longer. - Why? Judging by the date when Edit saw the formula and date of her scan two months later, it can be seen that entity is growing fast. At this pace he should have doubled its weight. Based on the time that has passed since I think that Edit has serious health problems. Friends, I cannot do anything more for her. Should we try to take her to some private clinic? Without ID chip they won?t even look at her. Has anyone called her folks? - I did. I told them that we are going to Sirogojno village To visit loom-knitting museum. Why are you looking at me? That was the only thing I could think of. - Never mind. Cops have probably visited them by now. ?They were at your place? Of course. - Fuck. I'll have to lay low for a while. Ok, so you put this one here, and this one there. Like that, all right. So, you just have to move one match so that it equals... You are really not much of a mathematician. Hallo? Do you hear me? Where do you think you're going? I have to finish something. I give up. Take me for the operation. This wasn't really wise. - What? That I had implanted damn chip and now I am sitting here waiting to die! - And you will. Police is already on their way. Sergey has bio-meter on the wall. Shit! Exactly, because now you have the opportunity to spend in jail the life you try so hard to keep. It would be wise to move on. Now I really hate you with all my being! Denial of the ego is good first step in spiritual development. - Eat spiritual shit. Anti-matter in carton. Revolutionary formula only for our market, powdered anti-matter. A simple use in useful package. Call now and make your own pocket space with reduced price. And that's not all... Abel, you are such a shit eater... You are sitting here silent, and I am babysitting you, while Edit is who knows where with that thing... So what if you wrote the formula? I finished fourth year on faculty and I am not silent. On the contrary... I'd like to scream. - Hi. Where is Edit? - How should I know? You were supposed to keep an eye on her. You saw the condition she is in. - How should have I stopped her when she kept hitting me with electricity from her finger? She says she wants to go and I say 'go'. Why didn't you follow her? - How? And what about this joker? - When did she go? Two days ago. - Two days ago? Yes, when one of you two should have come to relieve me. My God, she could be anywhere. I am ashamed to face people because of you. Look at me... I haven't seen parents for days. Everybody is looking for me. I've been charged with cop killing and now nothing else matters. I am going to die anyway. At least give me some strength to go to hideout. I don't want to die in this garbage. Bojan! You speak? - You have to go now. I'll guide you. Professor, we have intercepted an ambulance call. Girl matching Edit's description has been found dead bellow Branko's bridge, with disabled chip in her arm. We have dispatched one car with the ambulance. The ambulance is spotted! Did you check everything? - Yes. - Is everything all right? She is dead. - Turn left. Car 772, roger. - Left again. Mica, we are ordered to drive the body to the TDR building. Turn left again. - You genius, we are driving in circles. Now left. - I say we are circling! Shit, they are already here. - You have to get her body. This can be done a lot smarter, but I can't think of anything. There is no ID chip. - So what? - What do you mean so what? Maybe someone is after her? Convoy attacked. Instruction, please! Good evening! - Good day! Use the procedure 32! Undress her. - As in naked? Yes, and leave her here. In the middle of the room. It is wonderful. - Is it better like this? Yes. Don't stop. Unfortunately, Edit, we are not here to cuddle. There is no time for that. - Edi... What are you doing here? Where am I? What is this place? This place... Some eggheads have postulated about this place. It would be too complicated for me to go into that now. Let's say we are in a Heaven. I am dead? - We are dead. Actually not, but let me start at the beginning. When whole adventure ended we were faced with a question... What now? Who now? And we knew the score. Nothing personal, but my body, just like yours had a drive for self-preservance. I would continue to grow even if I didn't want to. That night at Sergey's... I killed him. That made me think. Then something strange happened. I noticed I was getting older. Although my body is eternal, I am not immortal. I had a question, like everybody in that room. Meaning of life... - Exactly. But unlike humans who are, because of their bodies, unable to know such a thing, I could, being a machine. In the moment of awareness I have processed equal number of conditions for staying and not staying in function. For the first time in my life it didn't matter to me. I wanted for you to go on living. To give life was my last task as a living being. But at that moment it was already too late for you. You were killed by metabolically induced problems caused by the presence of a foreign body. Then I died too. There was this last problem. What about my body? Before I died I programmed it to keep you alive in a stasis as long as possible, so that, clinically speaking, you are not really dead. My perception of the reality has radically changed in the moment of my death. I have realized that there is direct connection between spirit and matter. I realized that I could control matter with spirit. And now it is time for me to say goodbye. Here is a parting gift. It's over. Everything is over. - Not exactly. Police is on their way. Fuck, I rise from the dead and you manage to spoil that. What was I supposed to say? - For example... 'You are alive'. She is alive! That is the story... When I come to think of it I cannot say that I am sorry this happened. I learnt a lot about me and about others. Police took us in, but they didn't arrest us. TDR didn't press charges, and whole case as well as accompanying damages mysteriously went away. As for the others, everybody is doing OK. I am still with Bojan... Broni got together with Herb, Herb with Sanja, Sanja with Woo, Woo is still in love with Broni. Professor wasn't able to make his future predicting machine but he got rich with the revolutionary chip. Abel got his piece of the action, so he is now lying around on his own grass field. About that kid from kindergarten... I easily found him and told him I remembered everything. And Edi... I hope that he is swinging on some electronic cloud with Otomo.
