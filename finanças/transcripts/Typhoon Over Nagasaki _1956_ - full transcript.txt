TYPHOON OVER NAGASAKI You're leaving already? Yes. See you later. Thank you for today. Pierre, I'm very happy for you. Come, I'll introduce you. Congratulations for the launch of the tanker. Thanks. Thanks. Excuse me, I forgot. Mr Marsac, do you still like Japan? More and more... All thanks to you. Just a month ago, you introduced me to Noriko. With her, I have presented you with a small piece of Japan. For 2 months, I didn't see much. Tankers are much the same in Saint-Nazaire as in Nagasaki. You see, Mr Marsac... ...we never invite our wives to dinner-parties. It's more pleasant. It's the Japanese style. I like that. You quickly get used to the tatami. To the health... ...of the excellent French engineer, Mr Marsac. I hope he doesn't leave us... ...until some months, after completion... ...of our tankers. I thank everyone. And I want to continue to work with you. And honestly, the idea of staying in Japan longer than expected... ...appeals to me a lot. I will think deeply about it. Thank you so much. - May I... - Thanks. You are a very pretty geisha. He says you're pretty. It's very good. Take them all. But I refuse to try without my vacuum pump. In this case... ...you will have to ask the factories of Osaka to speed up manufacturing. Mr Marsac, telephone for you. Thank you. I come back. Hello? I'm calling about your assistant. He confuses the colors. The green fabric is wrong. Do it again. Good morning. Welcome. - Is your sister here? - Yes. Saiko! Welcome. So, your marriage is coming soon? It's due to be in 3 weeks. - Congratulations. - Thank you so much. - This is for you. - Thank you so much. If your parents had not died, they would be very happy. So, we'll dance that at your wedding? Why not? For a foreigner, he's a nice guy. Marsac-san, dance! Oh no, Saiko! With Masao. He's very good. - We Dance? - No. - Why not? - I don't know how. Are you making me dance? Excuse me. - Oh, Peter, I... - What I? I... What does it mean? Guess. I don't understand. "I love you." I still don't understand. You understood? I... ...love you. Pierre... I love you. - Did you find the cucumber? - Yes. It's something. I just saw Mrs Kamo. You'd better not show yourself... ...so often with a foreigner. Even she is saying it. She's worried. You have no parents. But everything we say to you... is useless. You always do what you want. What an age we live in! - What is this? A circus? - No, no. It's advertising for local traders. You know, I'm starving. Ah yes... I'll never get used to it. It's just not done in Japan. Come. My friend Ritter is waiting for us. Ritter-san married a friend of mine. He lives with her and her sister. You will see... Ritter-san cooks very well. Good morning. It's here. Keiko! Keiko! Hurry up! I told you you'd be late. You always keep the guests waiting. Get the door. Hello, this is Mr. Marsac. - This is Keiko... Miss Ritter. - Good morning, Mr Marsac. - Everyone speaks French here. - Me, a little bit. This is Yoko, Keiko's cousin. Welcome. How beautiful! Walk carefully. And this is my friend Ritter. Ritter-san, Marsac-san. Delighted. Noriko has talked about you so much... ...I wanted to meet you. How pretty it is here. I wish I had a house like this. I'm sick of European hotels. Come and see. Follow me. Come on. It was he who taught me French. The first lessons. Afterwards, Noriko went to the Franco-Japanese Institute. I'm not a good French teacher. Yes you are! I'm Swiss... German Swiss. This way. Have you been here for very long? Yes. When I came, I was quite skinny. I wanted to become a judo black-belt. I gave up judo, but I stayed in Japan. And then I married Keiko. And there you go. I can rent you all this, if you like. No... Yes. It was my mother-in-law's bedroom. All right. I like it. I was sure that Marsac san would love your home. I was sure he would. Thanks. I'm glad to have Mr Marsac at my house. Only you'll be obliged to sleep on the floor, on the tatami. - It doesn't bother you? - No, not at all. The pencil. Notebook. Notebook. Notebook. Hold on. Hold the propeller. Watch out for Ritter's flowers. Hold on! Notebook. Hold on. Come. You take it. Hang on. Don't fall. You didn't hurt yourself? Oh no! It took me years to get this. Look at this! - For you, Marsac-san. - Thanks. Guess who's arrived at the Oriental Hotel in Nagasaki? Me! - Is it bad news? - No not at all. Good morning. Good morning. Good morning. I've come for Tadao. With you, he forgets school. Hello, Tadao. Good morning, good morning... Excuse me. Hello? That's extraordinary. I knew it was you. Am I laughing the same way? What are you doing here, you dope? I was passing by. I came to give you a little hello in Nagasaki. - Are you staying long? - A few days only. I'll fly back via Paris. The Eiffel Tower, the Champs-Elysees... you know? Hey, are you coming back to France with me? Don't worry, I'm kidding. When do we meet? Dinner tonight? Listen, tonight... Tonight, I can't. Yes... of course. I pop up after a 2-year absence. You may not want to see me. I'll come see you at your hotel. All right. Oh... No, look, it's not convenient. I unpack my suitcases. My room's in a mess. There's nowhere to sit. So, in an hour at the Guinrei bar. It's next to your hotel. You English? No, French. French! That's so good! I love you. Am I late? As usual. So... You've already been shopping? Yes... Some funny little things. Oh, sorry. No, let's go over there. Oh, my packages. - French lady? - Yes. You don't change. Always with women. She's a hostess. What would you like? A Martini, please. To amaze you, I learned before coming. You haven't changed, either. They have a passion for photography, in this country. Come on. Keep that one. It's for you. No? Oh... Thanks, you're a love. I bought you one 2 years ago, before leaving you. It was so abrupt. I didn't have the courage to give it to you. It's silly. I don't think so. It might have made me happy. You looked so unhappy. Yes. I was very unhappy... and very stupid. I can still see you... You were walking on the beach with a tragic face. We had a drink and you said to me... "You're the only one I'd give up everything for." "I'll follow you to the end of the world." Do you remember? Alright... Here we are, at the end of the world. Yes. But I didn't follow you there. I came alone. And you too. That's good. Looks like Breton pancakes. It's made with split peas. I'm glad to see you again, Pierre. You, not so much. Don't talk nonsense. Anyway, I had to see Nagasaki for my report. The atom bomb side. Did you go to Kyoto? I've been everywhere. It's been fascinating. I've done all of China, before ending up in Japan. Can you imagine the adventures? I'll bring them back a terrific book. Not a nice little girl's book. I'm saving that for my report on Japan for a women's magazine... Pink cherry trees and green kimonos. You know the kind. My woman-of-letters side. Are you bored? - No. - You hate that, I know. Will you excuse me while I make a phone call? Hello? Good evening. It's me, Pierre. I'm running a little late. No no... 10 minutes at the latest. See you soon. What's her name? Noriko. Wait, let me guess. She has brown hair and she has eyes like that. Am I wrong? No. Barman! Listen I hate to ditch you on your first evening... ...but I'm dining with her. Nothing wrong with that. If you want, we can meet after dinner. I'll be free by 11. See you at Ginbasha. It's right in the center. And it's the only nightclub open at that time. Okay. You forgot your tie. I'll make you a tomato sauce, with the stew. And this... ...is to accompany the stew. Where did you find that? It's my wedding kimono. Isn't it pretty? You're crazy to bring it into the kitchen! Don't worry, I'll be careful. Saiko is showing you her wedding kimono. Oh! Stunning! It's a very pretty wedding kimono. Go put it back in the closet. Soon it might be your turn, Noriko-san. Shut up. Sorry, dinner took longer than I thought. In Japan, it's up to the women to wait. Excuse me sir. Sir wants a table? Would you like hostess? - No thank you. - But yes, why not? - What do you want from her? - A chapter for my book. You saw Mr Marsac. He finds a pretty girl. So he dumps us. - Scotch? - Yes. Two scotches. It's funny... South America Japanese-style. My name is Sonoko. Francoise. My name is Pierre. Do you remember me? Sure. Thank you. No thanks. They're charming. It?s all made for you. Francoise... Yes? It's funny. I felt like I had lots of things to tell you. And you forgot them. It was just a feeling. It's normal. It's far away, Japan. And our story didn't last very long. You'll blame me again for your departure for Mexico. Marsac-san...! Marsac-san...! There is a visitor for you. Here is your visitor. - But... - Pardon me... You look so cute! I'd have come to Nagasaki just to see you like that! - Good morning. - Good morning. Very comfortable. Oh, even the little rice pillow. Oh, how wonderful! I will take a photo. Go wait for me next door. I'll be right with you. - Do you have complexes? - I know you. Once you've got started, you don't stop. Yes, yes. Let me take one. That's it! Missed! What do you want, exactly? You show me Nagasaki. I don't have much time to spare for you. It's just for the first day. Then I'll manage. I want to see where the atomic bomb fell. All right. I'll take you there right away. Good morning sir. Madam. Tremendous. A photo. - No. Look at the time. - Just a second. - What do you want me to do? - Go ahead. - Uh... Look there. - Tell them to look at the screen. Not there... here! There... Hide now. No no! Look image! - Look here! - Look there. Not me. Not me. Now hide! There! Good. That's it! Oh! One second. So. Thanks. I'd like to buy a doll. Pierre... I forgot to ask you something. I'm indiscreet, but... ...are you in love with this Japanese girl? Yes. I take this one. How much? 100 yen. I'd like to meet her. What's her name? Noriko. Yes that's it. Your Noriko. It doesn't seem necessary to me. Yes, it's essential. - For what? - Otherwise, I'll be jealous. - If you meet her, you won't be? - I'll tell you when I see her. Yes? Thank you. Miss Fabre comes down immediately. Thank you. I wanted you to meet my friend Francoise. I really like this friend. She leaves in 2 days. Maybe this dinner would bore you? No not at all. I really want to know your friend Francoise. Here she is. Francoise Fabre, Noriko Sakurai. - Delighted to meet you. - Me too. What a pretty dress! - Yours is lovely too. - You're too kind. Can you get pretty fabrics in Nagasaki? I want to buy a lot of things. Noriko has a specialty kimono store. Tremendous. I will come to see you. I really want a kimono. I will be happy to give you one. That's very generous. I don't know what to say. Let me give you a present too. So. It's too pretty... I can't accept it. Of course you can. It's my pleasure. Thank you so much. I am very touched. Let's go to dinner. Do you like raw fish? Have you eaten it before? Oh dear, they're moving. They're alive. - Do I eat one? - You can do it. Sure. Serve her this. So... You're used to eating raw fish? Yes. I find it delicious. I chicken out. I want sea urchins. I love Japanese sea urchins. Urchins? You don't know them? Sea urchins... You understand? No, I don't understand. Yes... The sea urchin, we cut it in half... ...and we eat the inside. Oysters, oysters... Yes, yes, oysters... Oysters, shrimps, sea urchins. Ah. Picpic... Uni. Oh, uni! Uni! - Sake, Francoise? - Yes. No no. Please. Thank you. Please. Thank you. Thank you. He reminds me of someone. Not you? I didn't know you had samurai blood. What does she say? That it's a lot of fun. But it's a tragedy! It's a tragedy. Thank you for this charming evening. Goodbye. Lovely to meet you. - Thank you again. - You're welcome. And goodbye to you. You must be very busy. Phone me, if you have a minute. Sure. 'Bye. Miss Fabre. Akira Assano, from the Nagasaki Evening News. Could I get an hour to interview you? Not now... Tomorrow. Tomorrow. I am very tired. Good night. Pierre... You've been in love with this woman? Yes, I was. But it's far in the past, all that. I never meant all that much to her. Noriko... I've decided to stay another 2 years in Japan. I've already spoken to my company about it. You like Japanese tankers very much. Oh, Noriko... But all men lie a little. You told me that not so long ago. But with you, I don't lie. Truly? Pierre... - Enjoy your food. - Thanks. - Beer? - Gladly. But... Your little party for 3 went well? It went well. I love sardines. I get up to eat them. And the puppets... were they good? Very amusing. Sardines? No thanks. You're right. It's a vice. It's not serious to love sardines. Only, when I start, I can never stop. Your French girlfriend staying in Nagasaki for long? No. 2 or 3 days. I believe that if I went back to Europe... I couldn't cope with the women there, anymore. There is grilled chicken in the kitchen. - You want some? - No. Yes, yes, yes. I'll go get these little chicks. Mr Marshall is right. The tests with the pump must be repeated. Let's pick it up in Osaka. I've booked for Osaka. I'm leaving tonight at 8.30. He leaves tonight for Osaka. He'll finish the job. I will go with you to Osaka. You speak English? Excuse me sir... I'm looking for Noriko Sakurai's shop. Shop of Noriko Sakurai. Kimonos, obis... Is she an American? Don't think so. Looks French. What she says sounds like a song. I listened carefully. I didn't understand anything. Hold on. I'll ask her. I'm looking for Noriko Sakurai's... ...store... Shop. - Kim-on-os. - Kimonos? Yes, yes, yes, that's it! She's French. She said "oui". That's it. Noriko Sakurai. Store. So... where? - Sakurai Noriko? - Yes. She is looking for her store. Yes, maybe. It's right behind you. Goodbye. Alright. With us, we do it that way. It's here. It's here? Well, thank you very much. - Arigato! - Oui, oui! - Hello miss. - Hello miss. I was passing by, so I came to see you. You did well. Saeko, prepare a cup of tea. - Excuse me. - You're welcome. Good day Madam. How hot it is right now! That's why I would like a summer kimono. I'm leaving. Goodbye and thank you. I've never made a kimono for a Frenchwoman. You will be the first. It's superb. No no. That's for obis. For obis? This way. - You smoke? - Yes. Your store is lovely. Thank you. - We had a good evening yesterday. - Yes. - It was fun with the puppets. - Very. Please. Thank you. Saeko. My sister. Please. Thank you so much. Why did you learn French? For a degree in literature... Stendhal and the 19th century. I had to give up to attend to this. And now I've forgotten everything. I'd like to speak Japanese as you speak French. - What? - No, nothing. And do you like all this... kimonos, fabric? Yes a lot. But you too... You love your job, don't you? Yes of course. For what? It shows. You are so inquisitive. Earthquake. Small one. There, you see? It's finished. You're amazing... I'd hate that. I want 7-2-2-9 please. Ask for Mr Marsac. Hello? It's me. - Am I disturbing you? - No. That's good. - You are alone? - Yes. Good evening. I might as well be. Did you feel the earthquake? I don't know what's wrong with me... ...but I've felt really blue since yesterday evening. You can't imagine how much. I spent a terrible night, alone in this horrible room. I thought of you all the time. Of you and that Japanese girl. I imagined you with her. You have a lot of imagination. I came home after dropping her off. Really? Good... So there's nothing between her and you? Good evening. Good evening. Lots of things, but not that. Yes... I'm very jealous of that Japanese girl. Say that again. I'm very jealous of that Japanese girl. It's funny... I've waited a long time for you to say something like that. I told you I was going shopping. I went to her shop. Oh? Yes, I was choosing fabrics. She's nice and not stupid. I know. What are you doing right now? I'm leaving for Osaka. I'm about to take the train. But... when are you coming back? In 2 days. In 2 days?! Oh well... I won't be here anymore. I'm going back to Tokyo tomorrow, then to Paris. Surely not?! Oh well... Once you're in Paris, you'll quickly forget me. I don't think so. It doesn't matter anymore, though. Well then... Goodbye, Pierre. Have fun in Osaka. - Goodbye, Noriko. - Goodbye. Two days go by quickly. I'll be back for Saeko's wedding. I'll buy her a gift in Osaka. My little surprise. Have you seen your friend Francoise? No. She phoned me. - But you've seen her. - Yes. In any case, she leaves tomorrow. Does that make you happy? Pierre... your train. It's my fault... Again! Pierre, your train! Goodbye. Come back quickly. The boss is delighted that you agree... ...to sign a 2-year contract. Excuse me... Are you Mr Marsac? - Yes. - Someone wants to talk to you. It's him. This way, please. - Excuse me. - You're welcome. Oh... Francoise. What are you doing here? I wonder. I just know I had to take the train. I didn't think about it. How could I love you, when you're not thinking? Come over there. Where did you get a ticket for? To Osaka. Like you. You can't come with me. I'm with the Chief Engineer, Construction. Oh well... Alright, I'll get off. I'll walk back. You're stupid. Yes, I'm stupid. I'd forgotten how it was. Me, not quite. Francoise, may I kiss you here? Of course, you idiot. Your train! You can't understand, but it's wonderful. See you tomorrow! I would like to see Francoise Fabre. She's not here. Has she left yet? No, she should be back. - Oh good. - She's in Osaka. Osaka? Is that where she went? Yes. Thank you. You're pleased, I trust? You'll have your tests. As you wanted them. When we develop a patent, we hold on to it. How about a little outing between men, in Osaka? I'm sure Noriko would understand that very well. We need to relax a bit. The French have understood this very well. And today, I feel very French. Well... Unfortunately, I can't go with you. I promised to see a friend. A French engineer. That's great for you. I understand very well. It's much nicer for you to see a Frenchman. - So rare here. - No, not at all... To Noriko: Obliged to prolong trip. Impossible to attend Saeko's wedding. Big work problems. - I was afraid you wouldn't come. - The hotel informed me. A priest came to give me your message. What are you doing here? I thought that when I left the hotel, I'll get you to come faster. It's a private ceremony. How did you do it? We shouldn't attend. Hush. A mystery. I charmed the gentleman sitting over there. He's a diplomat. He offers this dance to the gods of his country. I thought that I too had a god to honour... You. So this is it. You're crazy... Adorably crazy... I don't believe you... ...but you're wonderful all the same. You should believe me, Pierre. But, Francoise... What is it? You never spoke to me like that. Don't forget that we're on the other side of the planet. You can't just play in the bathtub. You have to wash yourself. Come on. - Will you buy me another boat? - Next time. Just keep still. Here, a telegram for you. Nothing serious? Mr Marsac won't be able to attend Saeko's wedding. He has to stay in Osaka for his work. How so? Mr Marsac's not coming? We don't know yet. Your hair is too long. It must be cut very short. Yes... ...I'll cut it. Will you buy me a boat? Oh, sorry. Well I never! Oh no... Extraordinary. Looks like you've done it all your life. Great honour for little geisha to serve a noble foreigner. - But you speak French. - Yes I speak French. Just for that reason, I'd be interested in you. - Shall we dismiss the lady? - Yes. Thank you so much... You can leave. You may go. Thank you. Look at my hand, don't move. Everybody ready? One more time. If you please...! Thank you so much. To the Oriental Hotel. Goodbye! Goodbye! Have a good trip! Noriko, I'm sorry we didn't see Mr Marsac. Here he is! Farewell, Saeko! See you soon! Saeko, write to me, too! Hello, Noriko. I was nearly too late. Don't be sad... You'll see them soon. Noriko! Noriko! Noriko! Noriko... tell me... What's the matter? I don't want to see you again. Never again! Noriko! Pierre! Pierre, let her be. It's useless. I don't understand. Listen, Pierre... You're completely reckless. Don't you realise... Noriko knows you were with Francoise. Do you expect her to hug you? She knows? Yes of course... Listen, Karl... Francoise and Noriko... it's not a matter of one or the other. Francoise is... She's... She's Francoise. And Noriko is... She's Noriko. Yes. I'll never understand the French. Come in! Come in! What a surprise! Hello Miss. I'm glad to see you again. Won't you sit down? I'm sorry to disturb you... ...but 3 days ago, I came to bring you your kimono and... ...you were in Osaka. So I've come back. I hope you enjoy it. I wanted to give it to you myself. Thanks. It's very nice of you. My brooch. Come on... Forget Pierre and keep my brooch. Just for me. I don't have to please you. Besides... ...that brooch suits you much better than me. As for Pierre... He's forgotten. I saw him and... It's over. - You saw him? - Yes. I'm not surprised about him. - Cigarette? - No. Come on, Noriko dear, don't be so sad. You are young, pretty. You'll have a happy life. But Pierre wasn't for you. Like it or not, the French are like that. Volatile and nationalistic. Why are you telling me this? I didn't ask you! You still love Pierre... It's quite obvious. I don't love him anymore. Do I amuse you? Are Japanese dolls amusing? "Very funny", as the Americans say. "They're nice, they're cute", ...as you French say. It's true. I thought I loved Pierre, as you believe he loves you. With me... ...he may have had fun, but with you too, he played. He played in the past! "The Game of Love and Chance." It's a Frenchman who wrote that, isn't it? Japanese dolls don't know how to play that game. Have fun with each other! - Miss, what do you want? - A scotch. - With soda? - No. Neat. Are you still leaving the day after tomorrow? It will depend on my work. Inspiration can't be scheduled. I hope your leaving will not be delayed by the typhoon. What typhoon? Typhoon No. 3. He is currently in Manila. It might pass over Nagasaki. Well, now... Good evening. Looking for ideas? Yes. I have a great one... I'll stay in Nagasaki. Really? A typhoon will hit us. I don't want to miss that. A scotch. - Yoko, my cigarettes! - Okay. Here they are. Thanks. The damned rain will damage my cuttings. How are you, my little aphid? Are you still gaining weight? Come along. Off you go. This cursed rain! Thanks for today. It's a pleasure to have you all to dinner. Keiko learned Chinese food. Really? I don't guarantee it will be fabulous. How are things? Still sad? No, I'm not sad. Would you have liked me to have taught you French? I will never speak it again. To the table, to the table! Is this weather because of the typhoon? Without a doubt. Did you enjoy dinner? Yes. A lot. How did you do it? I lived 3 months in this hotel. I found the food awful. All my own work... I went to a lot of trouble. I wanted you to feel great tonight. Darling, don't look so glum. Don't you think you've had enough of tatami mats? Maybe. Who knows? The atomic bomb... what day was it? Which one? The memory of Madame Butterfly haunts the hills where the 2nd atomic bomb... When was it, darling? - August 9, 1945. - Thanks. ...on August 9, 1945. Come in! In the narrow streets of Nagasaki... Miss Fabre? A cable for you. Please, a signature... - Here. - Yes. Is it from Paris? Goodness! Listen to this. Enthusiastic press. Signings planned. Need you for advertising and other projects. Please come back urgently. Kiss you. Robert. Robert is my editor. If I don't go, it's a disaster. My latest novel is out, and I'm not in Paris! That's being a bit dramatic, even for Paris. You're not nice! Here's me ready to do anything for love. Goodbye. It's funny... You have the same smile as 2 years ago, leaving for Mexico. Good morning. Good morning. Good morning. Got your mail. Good morning, Mr Marsac. Is it true you're going to stay with us for 2 more years? Maybe. Like that, eh? Japanese girls. Good morning, Mr Marsac. Bad news for typhoon. The typhoon will pass over Nagasaki. The typhoon will pass over Nagasaki. The typhoon will pass over Nagasaki tonight around midnight. The wind will reach a speed of over 200 kph. Take all precautions against the tidal wave. Yes, another 50 minutes. You have to take the final security measures. I'm taking care of it. To all units. Each production unit must take... *...the final security measures. Each production unit must take final security measures. Take all security measures. Take all security measures. Double the mooring lines. Take final security measures against the typhoon. Turn off the electricity and store all appliances. Cut off the electricity and put everything away! Knock on wood! For us, that means... "Give us luck." In France you have luck. There are no typhoons. We have other troubles, believe me. Mr Marsac, a visitor. What? There is a visitor for you at the door. You wait here for me... I come back in 5 minutes. But no! You'll wait here! What are you doing here? You're crazy! Doesn't that make you happy? From one moment to another, anything can go wrong. You make a scene for me after I'm waiting for you for 2 hours! I have to stay here. I'm not going back to the hotel, alone! Madam. My dear fellow... ...it's time to prove the legendary French gallantry. I'll take her and I'll come back. Take care of the windows. - I bet it's flooded. - Normal, with this rain. Hello, anyway. - When I get it started. - Good. So? I have the 3X film. Will it be any good? I don't know. I got it. That'll be a winner! I hope it's the wind that's making you this way. Say something! It's not my fault that there's a typhoon. This time it's stuffed. Everything's drowned. We have to abandon the car. - Can't we stay here? - Don't be crazy! The wind will pick it up. We can be knocked down or crushed. - No time to waste. - Good. Let's go. What's happening? They had to cut the electricity as a precaution. A shelter is open to the public in the Okasama department store. Let's go to the Okasama store. To the store! Let's go! It's over there, quick! Wait! Let's go. Let's go! Francoise, there's a place over there. Is she hurt? Her house collapsed. - Where is she from? - Oura. Are there any more injuries? - Yes a lot. - Come this way. You know... Noriko is surely in a shelter, too. I'm not so sure. I know her. She wouldn't want to leave home. Listen, Francoise... You're safe here. I'll go. Oh no! Well, you must be crazy. You can't stand up out there. - Yes, I'll be able to stand. - Don't risk your life for her. Look at the injured being brought in. No, listen... I can't stay here like this, without knowing. - If you enjoy playing the hero... - Oh no, Francoise. That's not like you. See you later. Pierre... I can't stay like this either. I'm ready to give it all up. My book, my projects, everything. I'll stay here 2 years, if necessary. But don't go, I beg you! I have to go. I've changed a lot. I've understood so many things! Yes I know. Pierre, if you go... ...you'll never see me again. Everything will be over between us for all time. You know very well, nothing is ever over between us. Pierre... Where are you going? Noriko! Noriko! Noriko-san! Noriko-san! Pierre. How could you? I had to come. My neighbors came to my house. Their houses are too small. We tried to evacuate... ...but we couldn't. It's my fault. I waited too long. But I... I couldn't. Pierre! We have to try to strengthen the facade. The wind's blowing in that direction. It's a friend. He was worried about me. How did he get here? Pierre! Noriko! Noriko! Go! Noriko... Pierre... Pierre... Noriko... Have you seen Pierre? He?s alright. But... Noriko is dead, Madame. Noriko? Did Pierre send you... ...to tell me that? Yes. Fujita! Where is Noriko? Subtitles by FatPlank for KG
