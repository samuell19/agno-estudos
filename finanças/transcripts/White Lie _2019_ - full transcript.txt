There is information, you can sign up for the newsletter... Events and opportunities to... hey! ...Get involved, so, Katie has a rare form of melanoma... All the money we raise towards getting her to the States for this really great research... You have reached... Owen. Owen, it's me. I need to meet with you as soon as possible. Call me back, okay? Hey, guys, let's get started. We're picking up from the trio.... I want to see the diagonal phrase... Come on, honey. Remember the notes from Thursday, please. From the unison section? Exactly. I want you, Lydia, and Luke here. Come on in. All right, let's start there and see how it goes. Music. Fuck! Okay, let's stop that. Sorry, sorry. I know it, I just... do you think we can go from the beginning? Just so I can get into it? Yeah, yeah, let's do that. - Can you find the beginning? - Okay. All right, first places. - Katie? - Yeah? My mom wanted to give this to you. Oh, that is so sweet. Yeah, she tried donating online, but she just couldn't, she's old. No, this is great. This is so nice. I'll have to email her. Okay. Nice job today! Thank you! We good for Wednesday? We added a new part to our piece, we'd love to hear what you think! Yeah, totally. Looking forward to it! I'll just sign a few things, and then I'll be out of your way. Oh, did you not get my message? What do you mean? Um, Emmy Schreiner from the Jingwen... sorry. I always trip on this, the Jingwen Zhan Foundation... flagged an issue with your application. Come on and sit down. Oh, um, what's the issue? She didn't receive copies of your medical records. Oh, I-I sent those over. So when we last met on September 14th, you'd put in a request to have a copy of your records mailed to their offices, correct? Yeah, I did that. - Well... - Did they not get them? - No. - That's super weird. Actually, this happens all the time. I-I had them sent in, I called my doctor. And the nurse said... or the receptionist, said that she would have them sent in right away. They already charged my credit card. Regardless, it's really important that they receive those files. Okay, I'll just call them again. Shouldn't be an issue. Okay, great, because we're right down to the wire now. What do you mean? Well, the submission deadline is on Friday, so all of your records and your paperwork have to be in by then. I-I just thought I was coming in to sign for a cheque. This money could really make a difference for me, so... I know, and I'm not unsympathetic. How many applicants are there? Um, the numbers change every year, so I'm not exactly sure, but there are usually a lot. But they like you, Katie. I thought you'd be great for this, with your charity work, and the impact you've had on campus. When I heard about you, we thought that you'd be great. And I'm friendly with the foundation, and I think that you are a shoe-in. They really want to support you. So just get your medical records in order, and we'll see to the rest. Yeah, shouldn't be a problem. - Hey. - Hey. Thanks for meeting me. I don't have any Stemetil, but I have Dexamethasone. What's that? It's a steroid to reduce brain swelling, it was on your list. - Okay, how much? - Uh, $200. It wasn't that expensive last time. This one is more expensive. Well, I don't have that much. - How much do you have? - 80. How about, um, 80 for the bottle? What am I gonna do with just the bottle? I don't know, fill it with Tic-Tacs. I can give you 50 for the bottle. 80. It has your name on it. Let me see. It's in the glove compartment. Just dump the pills in the bag. You cool if I drop you here? Uh, no, I need something else. What? I need a copy of my medical record. That's easy, you just ask your doctor to... No, I need to make some changes to it. Do you have the originals? No. You need them from scratch? Yeah, I need ones made. You need faked medical records. Yeah... Can you do that? Photoshop them or something. No, I need them to be authentic, why can't you do it? I work in a lab. Fuck... Do you know someone who can? Maybe. I have this old roommate. He was a year ahead of me. He's got things for me in the past, but... Um, I don't know about this. You'll ask him? I might be able to talk him into it if you can guarantee a thousand or two. I can get a thousand. I mean, two thousand would be better. He sends money home to his mom, she's paralyzed or something. I don't know, she's expensive. So I can try and play... I can only do a thousand. Well, I mean, let me talk to him. I wrote down some details about my diagnosis. Okay. You know, he's, um, he's gonna have to know your name, right? - Yeah. - All right. Hey, sweetheart. Hey, how are you doing? Good. Veronica said the tickets are selling really well. Yeah, she was texting me. Awesome. How's, uh... how is studying going? I don't want to talk about it. Do you want to come over for a study break? Yeah, I'd love that. I'll see you soon. Okay, bye. Can you talk to Veronica about not having the View article on the table? You're the front page. I know, but she misquoted me a bunch, and I sound like a dumbass. You don't sound like a dumbass. Well, I don't sound smart. It's a great picture of you. It's an okay picture of me. I'll tell her to keep it off the table. Thank you. I just don't want to seem like a bitch, you know. There's really nothing wrong with the article. Did you find a dress for the fundraiser? Yeah? Yeah, I got one on Saturday. Can I see it? It's in there. Looks good, right? Yeah. I think it's beautiful. You can wear it on Friday. What? If you like it, wear it. Well, what would you wear? I'll find something else. Try it with the heels in there. Oh, shit! We got a donation! How much? A hundred! From May and Ken Parsons. 2,545 now. Do you know them? I don't think so. Your Seattle appointment is really soon. What do you mean? There's only 12 days left, I'm worried we won't make the goal. We'll make it. You're going no matter what. I'm not taking money from you. It's the same as last time. We got the majority of our money at the start and at the end. Somebody named Owen. Oh, yeah, thank you. Hey. Hey, I talked to my buddy. Okay. He'll do it. Okay, when do I meet you? No, you're gonna have to meet with him. Why do I have to meet with him? I don't know, it's a pretty complicated thing to do. He said he could meet tomorrow at noon. Yeah, okay. His name is Jabari. What's his last name? Why do you need it? Just meet him. I should know in case something goes wrong. Whatever, it's Jordan. Jabari Jordan. You can meet him by the reception. I mocked up the banners. What? For the fundraiser. I want to see those. Just let me get this off. Who was that? Oh, it was the registrar's woman's assistant. I got the scholarship. Just now? No, she told me in our meeting today. She said she really loves everything that you and I are doing. Really? That's so good! Yeah, he just needed my SIN number. Are you sure about the dress? Excuse me? Hello. Can I help you? - I, uh... - Do you have an appointment? I'm... Sorry, can you give me a moment? I'm just... I'm meeting someone. I'm actually looking for Dr. Jordan. Do you have an appointment? We were supposed to meet here. I can check if he's in. Thank you. Just a moment. What's your name? Maria Bennett. Yes, I have a Maria Bennett here for Dr. Jordan. No. Okay. I'm sorry, Dr. Jordan is not available. Okay, um, thank you. Jabari? I'm a friend of Owen's. Can we talk? Was that... was that you who asked me for at reception? I was waiting, and you didn't show. You shouldn't have asked for me by name. I had no choice. Owen said you'd meet me at noon. I got pulled into a meeting. This won't take a lot of your time. Owen said... Owen shouldn't have spoken for me. Okay. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to freak you out. This will be quick. Your name's Maria? Katherine. Katie. Reception said your name was Maria. That's what I told her. You don't need... Look, Katherine, I'm, uh... I'm not gonna do this for you. Owen said you've done this before. Owen said that I forged medical documents? He said... He said that you'd help me. Well, he shouldn't have said that. I looked you up online. And I saw your fundraising page. And... I don't want to know what you're doing. I don't want to be a part of it. So you can tell that to Owen, and leave me alone. Owen said that you send money home to your mom. I'll give $1,000 if you do this. I'm not doing anything wrong. $3,000. I don't have that much. Well... I don't do less. You understand? It's not worth the risk to me for any less. I could lose my licence, I could get thrown out of my program. And... I know about you now. Okay. $2,000. Thanks. - Hey. - Hey. Hey... You haven't seen the place in awhile. Yeah, it's still blue. We're paving a drag strip on the west side of the oval in November. That's great, Dad. Oh, you know, I saw... I saw this really cool video someone put up on Facebook of you dancing. Oh, yeah! Yeah, Jennifer put that up. Jennifer is a friend? She's my girlfriend. Ah, right. So you're... you're good to dance? I mean, it doesn't hurt or something? Yeah, no. I mean, I get tired faster, but my teachers look out for me. We're doing another show on Friday, it's a fundraiser. So it's like a... for charity, or for you? Uh, well, both. We haven't partnered with anyone yet, but Jennifer is thinking we could donate a portion if we do really good. So you're still... You're not getting any better? No. Uh, but that's... that's why I'm here. I, uh, there's... I found a place that can help me. Oh, yeah? But it's really expensive. Doesn't OHIP cover that? Well, I'm trying this new experimental treatment in Seattle. I'm in a test group, and they scheduled me in, but it's really expensive, 'cause it's in the States. How'd you find the place? Jennifer's parents give to a bunch of charities, and they put me in touch with someone, or hooked me up with a team there. They're trying this new treatment called immunotherapy. So why are you coming to me? They can't pay for it? Uh, I mean, they've already done so much for me. I don't want to ask them for more. When is it? It's, uh, January. How much do you need? It's $2,000, but OHIP won't cover it. That's not so much for that kind of thing. It's to cover the consultation, and flights, and hotels and stuff. I'd have to go back down again for the actual treatment if I qualify. I'm not looking for a handout, there's bursaries for students like me, so... Bursaries, like a scholarship? So... are you working? Do you still have a job? I mean... No, I had to quit right before my first round of chemo. The deadline is Friday and I can pay you back then. How much is it? It's $2,000, Dad. Can I ask you something? Uh, you're not going to like this, but I want to know if you're in some kind of trouble, like you were before. What? I know I'm not always so good at knowing how to handle these things, but... I don't think money is the way to help you. I'm not well, and this place could actually save me. I wouldn't be here asking you if it wasn't really important. Here's the thing. Susan and I remortgaged the place. And we consolidated our debt, which we've been meaning to do for a really long time, so... no, I can't loan you the money. And frankly, I'm not sure I would if I had it. What do you mean? I don't believe you. Okay... We don't have to do this again. I'm just asking you for something simple. And you're calling me a liar, so... I don't think you have cancer. Of course I do. Do you realize what you're saying? Yeah, I really do. Jesus, what the fuck is wrong with you? What the fuck is wrong with you?! You are such a fucking loser, you know that? I know you don't have cancer and you're lying, just like in high school. I'm sick, Dad. You should be one of the people helping me fight, not making me worse! You're gonna have to tell these people if you're taking money from them. You're going to have to take all that online stuff down. You are going to get into trouble. I thought that you would feel guilty enough about Mom that you wouldn't want to take that chance again. You lying to Jessica too? - Who is Jessica? - I mean Jennifer. Katie? Katie! You were asleep. Oh, sorry. Have you been waiting long? No, I was just feeling a little light-headed. Okay. Do you want to get something? We can go somewhere else. Not hungry. Did you take your pills today? Oh, not yet. I'm happy you texted. I didn't think I was going to see you today. - Is this them? - Yeah. You don't look so bad. Chemo was this morning, right? I know you said you don't want me there, but I have decided that I should start coming with you. They wouldn't let me. What do you mean? My red blood cells are too low, so... they pushed my session to next week. Is that a bad thing? Well, I had to do an MRI. I had a seizure, or at least they think I did. - What? When? - Last week, I think. I was at home. I've been throwing up every morning. Isn't that because of the chemo? It's hard to say. How would you not know that? They think the melanoma may have metastasized to my brain. They don't know for sure, but they said they'd have the results tomorrow. I need to call my Mum. No, please don't. Seattle can move up my appointment if the results are bad. God, I wish I was there. I don't have the money yet, Jen. That's fine. I'll transfer it to you. How much do you need? $2,000 for the flight and two night's stay. Okay, are you sure that's enough? I'll pay you back, I promise. I'll send it right now. I need cash, actually. My debit is overdrawn, and so anything that goes into the account will just pay off the balance. Okay. I have a fucking withdrawal limit of $500 a day. Can you call them? See if they'll let you take out the rest? Yeah, sure. Thanks. Yeah, it's 2459... 9017... 8890... 2425. Jennifer Ellis. Uh, yeah, it's July 7th, 1994. Thank you, yeah. I need to take out $2,000 today, and the machine is telling me that I have a withdrawal limit of $500 a day, and so I would like to temporarily lift that. No, I understand, I just need to up it for right now. Okay, sure. Okay, thank you. We need to find a bank. Wouldn't it just be easier for me to book you a ticket on my credit card? - Probably. - Yeah, good. You wanna come to mine tonight? Yeah, but I want to go home first. Sure. Okay, come over later and I'll book you a ticket then. And I'm gonna tell my Mum and Adam that you're not going to make dinner tomorrow night. Kadisha actually already booked me a ticket. I just need to pay her back. Why didn't you come to me first? I didn't mean... you're right, I'm sorry. I was totally out of it, and she was just there. I'm sorry. I know I'm not handling this very well. So couldn't I just email Kadisha the money, then? No, 'cause I already feel bad about borrowing from her, and I don't really want her to know that I borrowed from you to pay her back. I know I made things really complicated, but can we just take out the money tomorrow? Yeah, okay. Your surname? Arneson. Given name. - Uh, Katherine. - With a C or a K? With a K. Date of birth. March 2nd, 1995. I don't eat. Come on... Sex, female. Marital status, single? I have a partner. Do you need to know their name? - Are you married? - No. Okay, you've got married, widowed, separated, divorced, single. You're single. Where were you born? Flamborough. - Occupation? - Student. - Nationality? - Canadian. Address. 732 Gibson Ave, Hamilton, Ontario. L8L 6K4. Cool. What do people think you have? Cancer. Yeah, I mean, what kind? Melanoma. Okay. When were you diagnosed? I'm saying about ten months ago. Ten months ago you told people? Yeah, I'm saying I had it removed in March, and then I've been in two rounds of chemotherapy since then. And then I'm doing immunotherapy in Seattle in January. You said you had the tumour surgically removed? Yeah, I have a scar. What do you mean? I have a soccer scar from when I was little. I tell people that's from when they removed it. Okay. What type of melanoma do people think you have? What type? There are different types. There's superficial spreading, nodular, lentigo malignant. - That's never been a thing. - Okay. Just... make something up, whatever you write is what I have. Okay, so you... you had a biopsy in January, had it removed in March, and you're what, saying you're in chemo now? Yeah. You're on your second round, you've already done two? I'm doing it now. I've been going once a week for three months now. No, no, that's not how... you probably wouldn't go that frequently. It would probably make sense for you to have something like one, maybe five days on, followed by three weeks off. But no chemo regime is weekly. We won't find anyone with a schedule like that. Everyone knows I go once a week. Well, that wouldn't make sense. We need test results and doctor's notes, so we need to find someone with a similar diagnosis and timeline. So I have 500 bucks. Are you kidding? The bank has a limit, the machine has a withdrawal limit. I-I couldn't take it all out today. And? And I could only take out so much. You said you had $2,000. I'll... I'll, uh, I'll give you this now, and I'll bring you the rest tomorrow. I'll go to the bank as soon as it opens, and I'll go to a teller, and I'll get it. The bank was closed by the time I got there, that's why I had to use a machine. Okay, well... I'm gonna take the $500. But I'm gonna keep the records until you give me the remaining $1,500, if you can get it. I can. I already explained that to you. I have the money. Please just let me take them and I promise I'll pay you tomorrow. I start my shift at 11. Text me when you're here. You have one new voice message. To play your messages, press one. To record a message... Hi, Jennifer, this is Doug Arneson. I'm Katherine's father. Sorry to call you like this, but I couldn't think of anything else to do at this point. I could use your help.

You're snoring. Sorry... Just go back to sleep. Now I'm awake. Hey. I'll pay you back as soon as I can. Don't worry about that right now. And I'll see you later for dinner if I can make it. - Bye. - Bye. You have reached... Jabari Jordan. Jabari, it's Katie. I'm here outside. I'm ready, I've got it. Call me back, okay? Hey, Jabari. Hey, it's Kadisha, we're all here. Can you still do it? Uh... sorry, um, I'm running late. You guys should start rehearsing without me. All right, see you soon. Okay. Hi, I have an appointment with Dr. Jordan. Uh... can you hang on a moment? - What's your name? - Katherine Arneson. Yeah, there's a Katherine Arnson here. - Arneson. - Katherine Arneson. She says she has an appointment with Dr. Jordan. Uh-huh. Okay. Sure. Sure, I'll check. Just one moment. Sorry, we don't seem to have you on his patient list. Sorry? Are you a new patient? Yes. Dr. Jordan's had to take a leave of absence. We're transferring all of his patients to other residents. What? Well, you said you had an appointment? I, um, I must have gotten the days mixed up. Well, let me just get your information, and then we'll get you reassigned and rescheduled - just as soon as possible. - Is he okay? He had a family emergency. I think he caught a flight out this morning. To where? I'm sorry, I can't disclose that, but if you give me your information... Yeah, sure, can you just give me a moment? Sure. You have reached... Jabari Jordan. Where are you? Answer your phone, it's Katie. I'm here. You fucking asshole. You fucked me. I'm here. I have the money. Where are you? Fuck your family emergency! I hate you! You're a liar. I hope your mother dies, you worthless fuck. Miss Arneson, hi. I'm Dr. Platt. Mary tells me that you had an appointment with Dr. Jordan? Oh, if now is a bad time I can come back. Not at all, we're just trying to sort a few things out. I'm one of Dr. Jordan's supervisors. Would you come with me to my office? Uh, you know what, I'm actually just in a bit of a rush. Of course. Could you tell me about the nature of your appointment? Uh... I'm sorry to ask such an indelicate question, it's just that Dr. Jordan won't be seeing his patients for a while, and we're trying to sort out what we missed. Where is he? He's gone home. His mother passed away early this morning, and he's taking a leave of absence. We're giving him as much time as he needs. I'm sure you understand. You know what? I'm gonna get you to leave your name with Mary at the front desk, and we're going to have her reschedule your appointment as soon as possible with another member of your team. I was just picking something up. Sorry? There's an envelope with my medical records in it that Dr. Jordan had for me, I was just picking that up. Oh, I could check that for you. Come with me. Just wait here one moment. Okay. Found it! I just need to see a piece of ID. Of course. Great. Just confirm your information with Mary, and we'll get you in to see someone as soon as possible. - Okay. - All right. - Thank you. - You're welcome. Hi, this is for Miss Stansfield. Yeah, she's actually across campus in a meeting, but you can leave it with me, and I'll see she gets it. She said I needed to mail it by the end of today. Oh, yeah. You're right, she left me instructions - on where to send it. - Okay. And you have two copies in here? Uh, no, just the one. There aren't duplicates in here? No, just one. Is that a problem. Okay, we're gonna need duplicates. Hello! - Oh, hi, Katie! - Hi! Shanah Tovah! Look at that! Sha-nah To-vah! Sorry. - Hi, Katie. - Hi! How are you doing? I'm great, I'm really great. Katie, this is my brother, Sam. - Hi! - Hi, Katie. Great to finally meet you. Yeah, so nice to meet you, too. And this is Isaac. Hi, Isaac! Hi. Nice to meet you, I'm Katie. What you building? A staircase that goes up and then back down. Cute. So I got my test results today. And? They were negative. They didn't find anything wrong. Oh my God. But what about the seizure? Uh, they don't know about that yet, but they think it's fine. I'm so relieved. I've been stressing all day, you have no idea. I've been feeling so much better today. I was really down all week, and I didn't tell you... but I actually think... I'm gonna win this. Come here. Guys, we got some amazing news tonight. We are destroying this cancer with all of you. See you Friday. Jennifer said you guys have been fasting? It's just Sam and me. Yeah, Isaac's a bit too little for that. Right, and Jennifer doesn't do it either, yeah? No, Nola and Jennifer don't. Why? Well, we do some of the Jewish things with them, but fasting is too much for me. Yeah, why do you do it? It's the day of atonement. In the days leading up to Rosh Hashanah, God inscribes all of our names into the book of life. On Yom Kippur, these judgements are sealed, so this day is kinda like, um, it's like a last appeal, like a last chance to change that judgement, to demonstrate your repentance and make amends. Come here, hey, do you want to give him the... Oh yeah, Sam, I brought a present for Isaac. - Is it okay if I... - Of course! It's just right behind you, can you grab it? - Sure, yeah. - Thanks. - Exciting! - Here you go. Are you going to open it? Come on, rip it open! Yeah! Do you want some help? Oh, it's a book! Yeah, I heard you like dinosaurs, so it's about a panda and a parrot who see dinosaurs in the clouds. Wow! He's even holding a dinosaur! Mm-hm! That looks fun! What do you say, Isaac? - Thank you! - You're welcome, buddy. Maybe Katie will read it with you after dinner. I'd love to. Oh, Jennifer, can you just help me in the kitchen? Okay. Do you need any help? No, it's okay. Sorry, love. That's pretty cool, huh? Oh! Hey, where are you going? Here, Isaac, Isaac, Isaac! Take a seat here. We'll look at this for a second. Oh, this looks like a great book! Yeah, I really like the artwork. Hey, Isaac? What's your... what's your favourite dinosaur? Um... brontosaurus, probably. Mm, they are pretty cool! Maybe it's an eagle but they didn't have the right paint so they just painted an orange? That looks like a boot. Excuse me. You have reached... Doug Arneson. Please leave your message after the... Hey... want to read your book? Okay. Let's go back to the beginning. Is that it? Yeah. Okay. Panda loved to draw, dance, and play music. See him there? Panda enjoyed reading, building, and solving puzzles. One day, Panda wanted to dance, and Parrot wanted to put the finishing touches on a castle. But parrot couldn't concentrate with Panda's loud music, and Panda got bored of dancing alone. Hey, you guys. We're going to wash up, okay, Isaac? - Okay. - Almost time to eat! Finish the book after dinner, okay? Yeah. Come on. Come on, buddy. You okay? What's wrong? Um, I think I'm just gonna go. Are you feeling okay? Yeah, I'm... I'm just gonna go home. Do you want to go to my place? I can come with you. I'm really sorry, I think I just... pushed myself too hard, and I'm gonna go back to my apartment and go straight to bed. - Are you sure? - Yeah. Okay, sure. Do you love me? Yes. Guys, Katie's gonna head. Thank you so much for having me. Oh no, is everything all right? Oh, she just has an early rehearsal tomorrow. I just, um, I pushed myself too much, but I'm fine. Really, I just need a good night's sleep. I haven't really been... Well, I'm so glad that you could drop by for a bit. But we'll see you Friday night, right? For sure. Can I drive you home? Oh, no, that's very kind, but I'll just get going, okay? Oh, I'm sorry. It was great meeting you. Yeah, you as well. Nice meeting you, Isaac. Can we give you some food to take home? - No, I-I'm okay. - Are you sure? Yeah, no thank you, I'm fine. Have a good night. I hope rehearsal goes well, and we will see you Friday. Good night, Katie. Bye! Bye. Okay, well, there's still a lot of food... Call me if you need anything. Yeah, I will. Okay. Please take it down. No. Please, Dad... I hated my life before I got cancer. I asked you to do something about this. Then let me do it my way. Please.... I can get better. Come home and stay with me and Susan for awhile. I know someone who knows a lawyer, and I think you should talk to him. No, you're not listening to me. I know a better way to end this. No. It's too late for that, Katie. Hi. Katie, what the hell is going on? You saw the post? Are you all right? I'm okay. It's not true, right? Of course not. All right, come. Why would he post that? I guess he believes it. He has this, like, disorder. Delusional something or other. I haven't spoken to him since first year, but he wanted to come to one of my appointments a few weeks ago and he just ended up asking me for money. And he threatened to... he accused me of a bunch of shit, it was scary. Wow. Is your mom home? Uh, yeah, she's just working, but I can... Can I talk to her? I just wanna do something quickly, I think I should sue him for defamation. Okay, yeah. Um... I'll go get her. Well, I told her everything that was going on, so she knows, but I'm sure she'll do anything she can to help. - Thank you. - Yeah. Okay, I'll be right back. - Thank you. - Okay. Hi, Katie. Hi! I'm sorry to hear what's happened. Thank you for your donation the other day. Oh, you're welcome. I'm gonna go finish my paper so come find me when you're done talking. Be in my room, okay? Okay. So Kadisha told me what happened. I just... want to know what my options are. Kadisha said you were considering suing your father. Yeah, for what he said. Did he say something publicly or was it just the one Facebook post? Just the post. Okay. But he posted on the event page for my fundraiser... I'm sure everybody's seen it by now. Right. Well, I can... try to, sort of, outline things for you as best as I can, but before we go any further, I need to make it clear, I couldn't act as your lawyer. I'm not a litigator, so it wouldn't make sense for me to take on your case, when, or if, it makes it into the courts. But I can recommend somebody, okay? If that happens. So you can't sue him? No, I'm in tax law, but I can give you a name. I just... I want to know what I can do, and I want the post deleted. Have you had any sort of contact with your father recently? No... I mean, he follows me on social media and he sees what I'm posting, that I'm making a difference and I'm raising money... He's always been very jealous of any success I've had. All right, well, there are a few different strategies. I mean, you could sue. But there are a few things you need to determine first. One, I would make sure and take a picture of that post in case it gets removed. You want to account for its existence, prove that it was published. Uh, two, you're going to need evidence that his statement was false, so possibly contacting your doctor and having them provide records. Do you think it's a possibility that you could call your father? I can't... Because another option is to speak with him, have him retract the statement, and then make a public apology. No, I want to sue. Sorry, can I see the post again? Uh, yeah. Yeah, it's still up. Hm, it's good for you, though. "She is faking cancer. "The money she is raising is for herself, not for charities." He's stating it as fact. Are you doing okay? Yeah, I'm just upset. Do you have any idea why he would say you're faking your illness? To stop my fundraising campaign? Is there any truth to what he said? No. Okay. After my mom killed herself, I pretended to be sick for a while so that I wouldn't have to go to school. That was in high school? Yeah. Okay. Could I have gotten in trouble for that? No, no, I don't think so, I mean... Not for that, not legally. So it's not a crime. You faked an illness to skip some school during an incredibly traumatic time in your life. I want to ask... what would be the case if that would happen again? If you faked an illness? If... Yeah. Well, that would depend on a number of factors, the... How much money have you raised? About $3,000. No, not just the campaign you're doing now. In total, from earlier fundraisers. How much, Katie? Well, does it really make a difference how much? Did you raise over $5,000? Yes. How much? Give me a ballpark. About $24,000. About that. Defrauding the public or persons exceeding $5,000 is an indictable offense. What does that mean? It means the possibility of jail time. So if you were faking an illness and taking money, or running those fundraising campaigns for personal gain, then yes, it is a crime. Can you return the money, Katie? No... - Why not? - It's gone. I'm going to give you the name of a friend of mine. David Loman. You can call his office in the morning and tell them I sent you. I'd like you to leave now, please. I don't want you speaking to Kadisha. (chattering indistinctly Hi, I was just wondering if Julia is in? I was in yesterday and I dropped off some documents with you. She is, um, she's in a meeting, but, uh... hold tight, she'll want to see you, so just take a seat. It will just be a moment. Okay. Do you recognize me? What? No, why would I? Katie. Hi. Uh, this is Professor Harney. Hi, Katie. Uh, yeah, I've met you once. Yes, I remember, you're hard to forget. It's good that you came, we wanted to talk to you. Can we go into the board room? Uh, the lady was just grabbing me a glass of water, I was gonna grab... Oh, Rose can bring it in. Oh, I just need to take my medication. - Okay. - She was gonna, um... She was gonna ask you about those copies of my medical records. Um, we're actually going to have to press pause on that for the time being. I've already spoken with them and they understand that there are a few things that we need to sort out on our end. We've pulled your application. No, that's a mistake. You could possibly reapply next year, but it would be good for us to go over some things now. Yeah. Guys, why don't we take it into the boardroom. Yeah. Come on. - That way. - Okay. So come on in. I don't have to be here... What? You're gonna do what you have to do, and I'm gonna do what I have to do. Come on, guys. This... Yeah, Katie, can you just come in and sit down and we can talk? You okay? Wait, what are you doing? Katie? Katie? Katie! Give it to me! What'd he say? You can... you can go in. How much will it cost? I don't know, he didn't say. How much for you? I don't worry about that. You know, just, um, don't bug this guy with all your questions. He's a... just be careful with him, okay? Okay. Oh, what, um, what did you tell your girlfriend? Nothing yet. Will you wait for me? Yeah. Aside from the baldness, you don't look that sick. I don't eat a lot... and I buy pills. I act like I'm tired all the time. Do you have any actual medical proof of your illness? I have a scar on my arm that I tell people is from when they took the tumour out, and I've had some records made for a school bursary. What are you looking for? I'm looking for something I can use. Take your jacket off. You make 'em yourself? No a medical resident I met through Owen helped me. Do you have a physician? Not really. My old family doctor, but I haven't seen him in years. I'm going to act as your doctor going forward. I'll write you a doctor's note you can show people, post online, whatever you want. can I get that today? We'll discuss that. Take your sweater off too. I can also build you a patient history. This will support your cancer diagnosis and your treatment timeline. Is this the scar? Yeah. Stand on the scale over here. Ideally that will cover everything up to now and whatever you want going forward. How long will it take? Awhile, but we can start with the note, and any other immediate needs. Have a seat. I'm gonna give you an injection of Saxenda. It's a weight loss drug, usually used for diabetes. It will change your mood a little. You'll feel a little more tender. You'll look more sickly and weak. You can tell people that your doctor upped your steroid dosage. It's gonna feel like somebody punched you hard, but that will pass. I'll need to see your insurance information. Okay. I'm gonna start by having you filing claims for Dexamethasone and Hydromorphone. My rate starts at $8,000. That covers establishing your history, prescriptions, any statements I have to make on your behalf. After that, it's $750 for every meeting. Insurance will help cover some of that. We should meet as regularly as possible, but it will depend on how much you can afford. Today is gonna cost you $5,000 no matter what we do because you're buying my silence. I'll wait to receive that, and then I'll get started. Can we work towards getting me better? You want to go into remission? - Yes. - How soon? I don't know, um... I have to figure that out. Hey, babe. Hey. How long have you been here? Just now. I'm sorry. I should have called you. Where have you been? I've been trying to figure everything out. I talked to a lawyer and I'm going to sue my dad. I tried to call you a million times. Why the hell didn't you call me back? I've been freaking out. Everyone's just been. And... and you just disappeared. Is it true? Do I need to show you proof now too? Why would your dad say something like that? He's a liar! - What does he want?! - I don't know. Money! So he's... he's... he's blackmailing you? That's why you needed my money. No, no, that was for the flight. Like I said. Don't touch me. I don't understand. Why didn't you call me back? I'm sorry, but... you've been afraid of my sickness ever since we started dating. What are you talking about? You were sick when we started dating. And I've been scared every day that you're gonna leave me. Oh, that's just... That's just your own psychological bullshit. Have you been lying to me the whole time? No, of course not. I need you to believe me. I do, if you tell me he's lying. He's lying. I really want to believe you. Here, look. My dad sent me that this morning. I told you what he's really like. They suspended your campaign. What? The page is down. I reported his... his post on Facebook. It's still there. They'll take it down. Just not sure how quickly. I know you're not telling me everything. Did you lie about it spreading? No. - Did you even have the MRI? - Yes. Of course. Do you want to see those scans, too? - I think so. - Okay. I'll get them for you. Jenn, everything is going to be okay. I just don't understand why he would say this? - How is this possible? - You're not listening to me. Answer it. I don't even know who it is. Just fucking answer it! Hello? Hi, this is Heather Shearer from CHPR. Is this Katherine Arneson? Uh, uh, yeah. Hi, I'm calling to see if you're available to speak with Matt Nichols on the morning show tomorrow around 8:15am. - On the radio? - Yes. We understand that you're a student at McMaster and yesterday some allegations surfaced about your cancer diagnosis. Was it your father who did the post? - Yeah, he's lying. - Right. He's trying to hurt me. I'm sorry to hear that. We've been doing a few pieces about social media shaming, and Facebook, Twitter backlash, and that sort of thing, and we feel like your story would fit right in to what we've been doing. Would you be interested in coming on for a bit and telling us your story? Uh, yeah. Yeah, okay. Great. Look, I'll have one of my producers call you back in about an hour or so and go over the details, timing, et cetera. Will you still be up? - Yeah, yeah, I'll be up. - Okay, that's perfect. It was great speaking with you, Katherine. Yeah, thank you so much. - Okay, bye. - Okay, bye. Jenn, that's crazy, this... this woman, this producer, from the Morning Show from CHPR, they want me to be on their show tomorrow. They want me to tell my story about my dad and everything. Jenn? This could be what we need to prove that he's lying. I need your help with what to say and everything. I'm not sure I can help you. Are you going to leave me? I don't want to... I'll... I'll lie to you right now! I'll say that I'm not sick, if that makes it easier. I don't care, I will do anything I can to keep you! My dad has lied his whole life. You know that. I have never had a good thing that he hasn't tried to take from me. Parents don't just do that to their kids, I mean... Your parents don't. No, shit.... that... that's not what I meant. Do you think I chose this? People look at me and stare, and avoid me. Nobody would choose this. We spent so much time together. How could I fake the tests and the chemo and everything? You were just so private. It's not about that. You are the first good thing to come into my life ever since my mom... I have never been in a real relationship before. And I got scared that if you saw what cancer was really like, that you would leave me. Maybe that was a mistake, I don't know. I don't want to be alone again. I don't want to hurt you. I'm so sorry. No, it's not your fault. Can I kiss you? You believe me? I wanted to all day. How do we fix this? We have to tell the truth. They took it down. Hm, what? The Facebook post is down. - When? - I don't know. It was down when I got up, I just saw it. Told you. I know. Are you going to have a shower? Uh-huh. We don't have much time. We're a little delayed, but we're going to bring you in - in probably five. - Sounds great. Do you need anything? There's water, juice... Oh no, I think we're fine, thanks. The bathroom is just down there, and I'll come get you when we're ready. - Okay, thank you. - Thank you. This place is smaller than I expected. I want to be a part of everything from now on, okay? I want to be at your appointments, and just... be there to hold your hand. And just be there with you, because I'm not afraid. I might have been before, but there's no point unless we're together in all of this. Okay. Will you marry me? What? I don't ever want to be without you. I'll tell you everything if you say yes. I won't lie, I promise. I won't be sick anymore. There's no point unless we're in everything together, right? Katie, we're ready for you. Katie? Mm-hm.
