In this time of our great celebration, Our society, the whole country, joins our struggle. We begin our gathering with the national anthem of Ukraine. Ukraine's glory has not yet perished, nor her freedom, Upon us, fellow compatriots, fate shall smile once more. Our enemies will vanish, like dew in the morning sun, And we too shall rule, brothers, in a free land of our own. Souls and bodies we'll lay down, all for our freedom, And we will show that we, brothers, are of the Cossack nation! Souls and bodies we'll lay down, all for our freedom, And we will show that we, brothers, are of the Cossack nation! - Glory to Ukraine! - Glory to the heroes! Look at those little birds! I haven't seen any ﬂashes... In 1917 and 1918... It's lies and slavery around, The humble folk forever silent, And on the throne of Ukraine A greedy bandit keeps his reign. He drinks the blood of our people, And sells our country bit by bit, Oh, God Almighty, how vain your world is, Your kingdom drowns in vanity. That's why we are here... I would brush your hair Your hair, your hair. Only my mother will be angry Be angry, be angry. She will look at me Look at me, look at me. As I make a fool of myself, A fool of myself. Oh, Marichko, I love you, I love you, I love you... I've come straight from the barricades, you see. This regime has created not an ordinary dictatorship, but a criminal dictatorship in Ukraine. It affects all of you. Don't you know that businesses have to pay daily rent to criminals. Don't you know that they want to destroy justice and law in Ukraine. Today people are revolting against lawlessness: when one family from Mezhigorje sucks the blood of Ukrainian people. Our revolution is an anti-criminal revolution! Our goal is to establish justice and rule of law! Down with the criminal gang! Down with the gang! Today, all of us here have one goal: To say "yes" to Euro-integration, "no" - to dictatorship. To say "no" to totalitarianism. We are a free nation. And we shall not allow anyone to turn us into a land of slaves. Because slaves are not permitted to enter Heaven. Just like you did, I hoped very much that they will sign an agreement with Europe in Vilnius. It didn't happen. They took away our hope. They took it away from me, my family, the families of Ukrainians. They took away hope from our young people. Listen, what were you thinking about? You announced a wedding, invited guests. You cooked stuffed cabbage, invited musicians... And then -you cancel the wedding! What do you mean by that? What were you thinking about? May I sing the Ukrainian anthem? May I? The anthem? Ukraine's glory has not yet perished, nor her freedom, Upon us, fellow compatriots, fate shall smile once more. Our enemies will vanish, like dew in the morning sun, And we too shall rule, brothers, in a free land of our own. Souls and bodies we'll lay down, all for our freedom, And we will show that we, brothers, are of the Cossack nation! Souls and bodies we'll lay down, all for our freedom, And we will show that we, brothers, are of the Cossack nation! - Glory to Ukraine! - Glory to the heroes! - Glory to the nation! - Death to the enemies! Here is my poem. I don't know if you'd like it or not. - Glory to Ukraine! - Glory to the heroes! Please listen to my poem: I gather verse from everywhere: From every land,from every man. It's up to us to save our country. We shed our blood to free Ukraine. Let us unite, my fellow Ukrainians! The freedom loving patriots, All those who really care... All those who really care And who can't stand it any more. Let evil tyrants tell their tales And say that we are breaking laws. They'll never make us mute or scared. The sacred Truth is our law. And so, let us, dear brothers, All come together to Maidan! The young, the old, the sons, the mothers, Will gain their strength and be as one. I know -we shall overcome This dark, unrighteous regime. Let's get together, dear brothers, I know -Victory will shine. Soon evil power will surrender. We'll break its' money-grabbing spine. Its' only strength is dirty money - Without money, it will run. - Glory to Ukraine! - Glory to the heroes! When the Russian President says that our Maidan is, I quote, "a pogrom", this is an insult. It is disrespectful. We don't understand how can a leader of a country speak in this way about the people of a foreign country. Shame! Shame! Shame! I am very surprised to hear Putin's monologues in which he gives definitions to our countries. He says them and us are one nation. Dear Vladimir Vladimirovich. You got it wrong. Your nation is Russian. Our nation is Ukrainian. We are different nations. We are different countries. And we insist that you respect us in the same way as we respect you. We shall not allow anyone, be it the Russian President or anyone else, to belittle us and to show contempt for the Ukrainian nation and the Ukrainian state. We have to fight! We have to win! We need to liberate Ukraine, so that our children have a good life. And all of you. So that good deeds prevail! My clear children! lam so very grateful to you! I know how hard it is for you to remain here. And I'm here with you every single day. I want you to know that I prayed for you today. And I cried for you. ...And in an unequal struggle They fell and died... Friends! We shall continue our struggle. You see - these scoundrels are trying to do everything in order to instill disappointment and doubt in the hearts of Ukrainians. And now they are trying through mass media, controlled by them, to spread the word that everything is winding down here. But this is a despicable lie! Because we are all full of energy and enthusiasm! When we came here we knew that victory is not going to come easy. We knew that the gang of thieves and liars is not going to give up easily. And this gang can only be overpowered by a great effort, determination and endurance of the Ukrainian people! Vitya, ciao! Good-bye, guarantor! Don't you come back! Vitya, ciao! Vitya, ciao! Vitya ciao-ciao-ciao! Your Mezhigorje, your Sukholuchje - they will become museums soon. Good-bye to "Berkut", To venal judges! Vitya, ciao! Vitya, ciao! Vitya, ciao, ciao, ciao! Not even lawyers, nor Vovka Putin, will advocate your evil crimes. So, I see that something is going on here. Ruslana is calling: Kievans, come! Kievans, come! The priests are coming. Danger! And what can I do? The first thing I did - what every poet does - I grabbed my pen. Here is what I wrote: Hold on, dear Maidan! Your dawn is coming, Victory is near, New day will bring us freedom. No one can overpower us! Our Ukraine is free! And the energy of people Is stronger than ever before! Hold on, brothers and sisters, God will help our country. Our struggle for bright future Will overcome the evil dictatorship! Hold on people... Hold on people, gather your power! God will grace us; the day will come! And we shall overcome the old regime As Heaven overpowers hell. Freedom stretches its hand to us. The whole world is proud of us. State - what is it? Civil accord and prosperous household, Strong army, And spirit of bravery Of supernatural strength! State means freedom! The ﬂags ﬂy high in blue sky. Our Ukrainian people Are the only masters of their land. State is a proud charging call, It's a battle of the worlds. It's light at midnight in a church Where prayers are said for everyone. It's gardens blossoming in spring And nesting storks on our roof, It's our long-suffering motherland; For her we live, for her we die. It's mumrny's embroidered towel, Straight as a path for kids to follow, It's a cry of a newborn baby, It's a loaf of bread in father's house. State is a golden sound Of church bells, rising to the sky; It's old mistakes of silly youth; It'll always live within your soul! God gives it to you. You have God's will within you. The hour of resurrection has come And Ukraine's fate is glorious! Thank you for your attention! ...You've discovered this potion, Of sun-kissed Red Rue, To possess my emotions. Don't you go looking For Red Rue in the evenings, You're my dearly beloved, Only You, my love. For your beauty is magic It's like crystal clear water, Rushing straight to my soul From the blue mountain peaks. You're always in my dreams, In those green enchanted forests, You run into my arms, Run along secret paths, Don't bring me the gifts and ﬂowers of Hope, You are always with me... - Glory to Ukraine! - Glory to the heroes! You are still alive, You waited too long... All the people, Who care about you, Will come to Maidan And fight for the future. They'll bring their freedom and love to you. Our ancestors suffered for a long time. God Almighty wanted us to build this house And we shall obey God's will. He will be our master and our leader. We never tried to escape our destiny! Rise up, Ukraine, you time has come, Look how you are being born in suffering! Great Taras did not hide his dream from us; It's taken a long time to get rid of slavery. Rise up, my Ukraine, there is joy in our hearts! Rise up, my Ukraine, we deserve freedom! Rise up, my beloved! All your towns and all your villages! The day of Victory has come! Glory to Ukraine! Let's pray to our Lord for annihilation and destruction of any power, which raises its Satan's sword! - Let's pray to our Lord. - Lord, have mercy. Lord, bless good intentions of your faithful servants all those, who are now in Maidan. Let them commence and fulfill without any harm to themselves their deeds. - Let's pray to our Lord. - Lord, have mercy. Lord, save us and deliver us from evil. Lord, have mercy. Holy, most pure, most blessed and glorious Lady Theotokos and Ever-Virgin Mary with all the saints, let us commend ourselves and one another and our whole life unto Christ our God. It is important that Ukraine is regarded as a prospective member of the European Union. We asked to accelerate the procedures necessary to abolish visas for the Ukrainians. So, my friends, have you watched the news? And now - do you want to become newsmakers? If you do, you can come to the training for civil activists, at 7 o'clock tonight. We shall have training, led by Evgeny Zolotarev, the Orange revolution veteran, who will teach you how to campaign and how to make a revolution. At some voting stations there were criminals and saboteurs, and corrupt members of the election committees faked ballot papers. And they swapped papers in the buses. And they arrived with faked results. They want to leave such a country to us, so that we continue to live in it and allow the criminal gang to rule the Ukrainian people. And I want the election committees, the authorities, the saboteurs, the palace of Mezhigorje to hear me now: down with the criminal gang! Down with the gang! Down with the gang! Down with the gang! Be careful! They spilled water here. Two volunteers are needed at the second entrance! Please, carry sandwiches to the people in Maidan. Don't bring back empty boxes! Please, tell them that you are from the kitchen staff. If there are any problems, call Diana. Thank you very much! There's no need for extra help now. Thank you. Watch out! Boiling water! Give way! Give way! - Glory to Ukraine! - Glory to the heroes! Let's say "thank you" altogether! Look, we have two more little singers here. Vitalynka and Mykolka are 4 years old. So let us say together: "Thank you! Thank you!" Glory to Ukraine! Good-bye, guarantor! Don't you come back! Vitya, ciao! Vitya, ciao! Vitya ciao-ciao-ciao! Your Mezhigorje, your Sukholuchje - they will become museums soon. Good-bye to "Berkut", To venal judges! Vitya, ciao! Vitya, ciao! Vitya, ciao, ciao, ciao! Not even lawyers, nor Vovka Putin, will advocate your evil crimes. Rise up, my country! Rise up, my people! Vitya, ciao! Vitya, ciao! Vitya, ciao, ciao, ciao! It's time for all to join resistance, to come and protest in Maidan! It'll not be easy! It'll not be painless, Oh, daddy, ciao! Daddy, ciao! Daddy, ciao, ciao, ciao! We'll fight for freedom of our country, we'll fight for freedom to the end! I think it's all one Flock. Yes? We have not seen so many lanterns in the sky of Maidan yet. True? I think this is a message saying: "Don't give me any cake, just take Yanyk away!" Yes? This is good... Pretty, isn't it? - Glory to Ukraine! - Glory to the heroes! I look at you and I think that we must start our gathering with the national anthem of Ukraine. I look at you and this mighty sight shows great strength. It proves that our struggle for victory is just. The national anthem of Ukraine: Ukraine's glory has not yet perished, nor her freedom, Upon us, fellow compatriots, fate shall smile once more. Our enemies will vanish, like dew in the morning sun, And we too shall rule, brothers, in a free land of our own. Souls and bodies we'll lay down, all for our freedom, And we will show that we, brothers, are of the Cossack nation! Souls and bodies we'll lay down, all for our freedom, And we will show that we, brothers, are of the Cossack nation! - Glory to Ukraine! - Glory to the heroes! - Glory to Ukraine! - Glory to the heroes! Greetings to you all, criminals! Look how many of us are here today! The criminal horde wants to bring us down to our knees and thinks that the Ukrainian people will obey it and will swallow the shit which they call "laws". But the Ukrainian people will not surrender and will not go down on its' knees. If it is necessary, all of us will put on helmets and camouﬂage gear, and we shall come in millions to defend our great and united country, our Ukraine! Right? Are you ready? Friends! Today a new path is opened for us, and we do not have the right to turn away. Yanukovych is not the President of Ukraine! Parliament is not the Parliament of Ukraine! Yanukovych is Kremlin's slave; he takes order from Putin. You know that they made it legal for "majors" to carry weapons - for the children of all those judges and prosecutors. It's bad enough that our people are suffering from their arbitrary rule. They knock people down with their cars, they hang radiators on people's backs and let them drown. And now they are allowed to carry weapons! This is the kind of laws they adopt now! You know, in order to protect families of judges they propose to hide them in kindergartens! They want to defend their criminal power with children's bodies. This is what their laws are like! Not to mention other violations of civil rights and liberties. And also - they made the decision that... that this gang did on January 16th and earlier; everything that this gang calls "laws"; everything that they imposed on us - we do not consider to be "laws". Because we are Ukrainians, and we do not recognise their laws! We must understand: their "laws" cannot be considered as real laws. Everybody, in every corner of Ukraine, must resist these "laws". Civil servants are not obliged to obey the orders of their superiors. Policemen are not obliged to obey the orders of their superiors. Shame! Down with the criminal gang! Down with the criminal gang! Attention please! All women are requested to vacate the territory. All women are requested to step back from front line. Attention please! Vitaly Klichko Dear friends! I demand from Yanukovych... I'd like to address Victor Yanukovych. Victor Yanukovych! I'm calling upon you now! You are fighting against your own people. Stop escalating the situation! Order your policemen to stop attacking people... Shame! Shame! Shame! It's not possible to listen To this mad cockerel any longer! Just calm down, my dears! I beg of you to be calm. You mustn't confuse lies with truth! Are you people or animals? Each of you understands that everything the President says is a lie. Have courage to become normal people. And I will die with you. If you go down this slippery road, down the road of lies... ...To destroy those liars in power... And Ukraine will live happily with other nations, but without those liars. They are shooting at journalists! Scoundrels! This is for journalists... They throw from over there! Re-vo-lu-tion! Re-vo-lu-tion! Sit down. Sit down. Remain in line! Are you alive? Down with the gang! Shame! Shame! Shame! Dirty cops! Dirty cops! Dirty cops! Ukraine above all! Ukraine above all! Ukraine above all! We are still fighting at the moment... I'm in Maidan now. Down with the gang! Down with the gang! Down with the gang! They shot people... They have no decency! "Murderers! Scoundrels! ...evil creatures! ...shooting your own people! ...they have no decency! Even cannot say who gives orders... Fuck them! Where were they shooting... They must think what they are doing... Down with the criminal gang! Down with the criminal gang! During this week, The week of the Pharisee and the Publican, during the week when we ask the Almighty to reveal the depth of repentance for each one of us, we also ask him to bless all of us with the gift of repentance: those of us who are here now, and our rulers up on the hills, and those, who can influence the situation in our country from afar. Only repentance leads to salvation. Only repentance helps us grasp the meaning of resurrection. We call upon the authorities with the same request to repent, just like all the people who are here now have repented. People who are here have repented and understood that it is impossible to continue living as before: tolerating evil, giving and receiving bribes and covering lies. A Christian cannot tolerate this. Now, those whose duty it is to defend truth and the dignity of Lord's children, have to make this gesture and ask for repentance. We call upon the authorities to hear the appeal of the All-Ukrainian council of churches, which was made public two months ago. There must be an investigation of the crimes, which happened here on the night of November 30th. The culprits must be punished. Those who are guilty of the crimes must be punished. This would be a true act or repentance. We will not accept anything else. This is not humane. This is not godly. Down with the gang! Down with the gang! Policemen are with people! Cops are with the bastard! Policemen are with people! Cops are with the bastard! Look, one of the Berkuts is down! Look! A great lady, a beautiful symbol of Ukraine, Ada Rogovtseva, made a speech on this stage after Maidan survived the attacks of December 11th. When it seemed that they would push us away, but we did not give in. She said: "My dears, I want my voice, the voice of grandmother and mother, the voice of a Ukrainian woman, to join one powerful and honest voice of Ukraine." She ended her speech with these words: "Your strength - our strength - is our dignity. The duty of every person is to preserve his dignity, in spite of everything. A man without dignity is an incomplete man. A nation without dignity is not at all a nation" These are beautiful words of a wise woman. I call upon you to hear this voice. Voice is freedom! Silence is slavery! Friends, keep calm! Kirovogradsky region! Kirovogradsky region! Doctor! Doctor is needed, urgently! Doctor, please! Doctor, urgently! Doctors are needed... Doctors are needed in lnstitutskaya street. Friends... If there are people with medical education among us, please, help us. Join our medical team. Maidan needs your help.

Ambulance cars! I call upon you once again, dear friends, those who have medical education, please, go to lnstitutskaya. Medical assistance is needed there. ...who has medical education, please come... Doctors to lnstitutskaya! Doctors to October Palace! Friends, we have no news yet... we'll tell you as soon as we know. Good... Guards, please come and talk to people! From this stage, I cannot hear what they want... They pushed "Berkut" into Mariinsky park! Our comrades report that they pushed "Berkut" into Mariinsky park! This is our first tactical victory! But... All our comrades at the front line! Attention, please! Do not move in small groups. Hold on at the front line. Do not disperse! They ask to fortify barricades in Grushevskogo street! Tires, rubber, bring all you have. It's needed in Grushevskogo. A lot of people are needed there. To Grushevskogo! To Grushevskogo! Our reserves are waiting for orders from the commanders. Please, organise passages for the policemen who surrendered. Let those who surrendered pass. Guards, please, secure the passage! They are asking for people in Grushevskogo! Please, those who are able to, go to Grushevskogo street! Hotel "Kiev"... I mean, hotel "Dnipro". Friends, Ukrainian House, European square... Those who can - please go to the European square, to Ukrainian house. Guys, make sure that those who surrendered can pass. Let them pass! God Almighty, people, you forgot your human nature. What does a man exist for? He exists for love. Lugansk! Rise! There are a lot of normal people there. In fact, there are much more than it seems. Only a small bunch of submen who rule there, they terrorise normal people. So, we are here now in order for them to rise and join us and burn everything down! To hell with it! - Am I right? - Yes! Friends, we have an important announcement. We have a boy here who cannot find his brother since yesterday. He will now announce his brother's name. Zinovyev Victor Yaroslavovich, born in 1979. If you hear us, your brother is waiting for you. Please, come to the stage, make your whereabouts known. Say it again to your brother. Vitya, I'm waiting for you by the stage. We’ll find him! Am I right? Doctor! Doctor, please! Doctor! Attention! Doctors are needed in lnstitutskaya street. There is a white ﬂag there. Next to the monument to the Founders of Kiev. Doctors are coming, be careful there please. A doctor is on his way. Doctors are also needed in the tents. To the left from the Christmas tree, where the tents of "Udar" party are, on the right-hand side... Please, remain calm. Please, do not be hysterical. I understand that everybody is stressed out, that a lot of people need help, but I urge you to show restraint. The situation is very difficult here in Maidan, please pay attention to each other. Please be careful and show restraint. Understand that our emotions are our enemies. ...if one person starts, the other follows him... Don't do it please! Step aside! Step aside! Guys, what's wrong with you? It's an ordinary bloke there. Come here. We've been informed that a sniper Is active in the hotel "Ukraine"... It's obvious that on the spot where the sniper is active, there are a lot of random people. They have no helmets or masks. There are a lot of journalists there. Yes... Journalists... ...people are just smoking... Glory! Glory! Glory! Heroes never die! Heroes never die! Heroes never die! Heroes never die! Heroes never die! Heroes never die! Please, make way to the funeral procession. Glory to the heroes! Glory! Glory! Glory! Dear citizens! I inform you that in the first ambulance car there are two men from Rivno: Arutunyan Georgy, member of "Svoboda" party, and Oponasyuk Valery Adamovich, born in 1971. In the second ambulance is Vaida Bogdan from Drogobych. Valery Oponasyuk had four children. I'm also told that Arutunyan had a 3-year-old daughter. Her mother also passed away. The girl is left an orphan. We ask the relatives of the deceased to accept financial support. Glory! Glory! Glory! Glory to the heroes! Glory! Glory! Glory! A duck swims upon the river Tysyna. Mother of mine, don't cry for me. You will cry for me in an evil hour; I don't know myself where I will die. I will perish in a foreign land, And who will bear me to the grave? Strangers will carry me to the grave. Won't this be a grief to you, mother? How ever, little son, could it not bring grief? You lay upon my heart. A duck swims upon the river Tysyna. The priests are going to join us now for the Lord's Prayer. Parents of the deceased are on the stage with us. Let us show them our support. A minute of silence. Glory to the heroes! Glory to the heroes! Glory to the heroes! Heroes never die! Heroes never die! Heroes never die!
