This is Mr. Shyam, Inspector. Arrest them. You are arrested on charges of bigamy, Mr. Shyam. But why? You have married a second time, although your wife is alive. That is a crime. This accusation that you are leveling against me.. Give your defense in court. You are insulting three lives.. ...that are innocent, blemish less and sacred. No book of law is greater than the book of life, Your Honour. Every page of the book of my life.. ...has answers to his allegations! To get to the truth.. ...however, we must begin from the point where my own life began. Excuse me. The name is Gopal, sir. - Nice name. I'm here for the accountant's job, sir. There's an ad. Issued by you in this newspaper. The ad says "Tuesday." So come tomorrow. I won't get the job, if I come tomorrow. Someone else will. Why not? Are you not qualified enough to be an accountant? I am, sir. But I'm also a low-caste, sir. So what? You can come tomorrow. I'm an honest man, sir. I will work hard. Pay me any salary you think fit, sir. I agree to every condition. All right. But please come tomorrow. I have a daughter, sir. She hasn't eaten since two days. If I don't land the job today.. ...she won't even be able to breathe anymore. Come with me. Here are some files and bills. It's for you to deal with them. I'll fix it immediately, sir. No. Go and eat with your daughter first. So you're strong enough to work. You're a great man, sir. What do I call this favour of yours? My name is Shyam. And you're Mr. Gopal, my accountant. Thank you, sir. Radha. Look! I've got food, Radha! Where did you get the food from? I'll explain. I was out job-hunting and came across an ad of a fishing company. They wanted an accountant. I went straight to the company's owner, Mr. Shyam. What? - Yes. "Shyam?" (A name for Lord Krishna). Yes. Eat something first. He first asked me to come tomorrow. And.. What happened then? I couldn't stop myself. And I told him that I am a low-caste. He still insisted that I come later. And I had to tell him that I had a daughter.. ...who hadn't eaten since two days. She wouldn't be able to breathe if I didn't find a job today. That was it! He gave me the job without any questions. He even gave me an advance. He said, "Go home. And eat with your daughter." Where do you find such people in the world today? I don't think he's human. He's God, I say. Forgive me, Lord. I was angry with you today. I said I'd never look at You, if dad didn't find a job. And You landed there today in the form of a human being! To give dad a job! You didn't even change your name.. You call yourself Shyam! Now that You have come down to the earth for me.. I will meet You. I surely will. I've been noticing your performance for many days now, Vijay. Am I not producing the desired results, sir? On the contrary, you are doing extremely well. Thank you, sir. Thank you very much. Tell me something. Why do you work so hard? You just have a job here. How do you stand to benefit, in any case? It's enough achievement that a man like you is praising me. You have achieved so much through your hard work, sir. Mere praise isn't enough, Vijay. I want to give you something. So ask for it. If you must, sir, give me the chance to begin my life.. ...so I am my own boss. So listen. I had no trawler to begin with. But I will give you a trawler. You will achieve the rest with your hard work and destiny. Good morning, sir. - Good morning, Gopal. What were you looking at? I was dreaming. - Really? With your eyes opened? This is one thing I have always dreamt about. See that ship there? - Yes. I want to own a ship like that one-day. Your dream can come true, sir. How? - There are so many.. ...banks and financial bodies in Mauritius. For instance, look at this ad. of the Bank of Mauritius. You can raise a loan from this bank, sir. Where are you going, sir? Bank of Mauritius. In that dress? - Why not? This is my business dress. Okay, I'll leave. There is no doubt that you have a sound and profitable project. I'm really impressed. Thank you. You have immersed yourself in the project. You have the confidence and the determination. But you lack experience. You do notice my inexperience, sir.. ...but can't you see how determined I am? It's like this; I have the will. And you have the money. Nothing is impossible if these could get together. Loans are not advanced on mere determination, Shyam. The client must at least be experienced.. ...in the business he seeksa loan for. I'm sorry to say this, sir, but I have confidence in my ideas. I will manage a loan from somewhere. But do remember.. you'll be the loser, not me. Wait, Shyam. I like you. I'm throwing a small party this evening. The directors of the bank will be attending it. Why don't you join us? Welcome, Shyam.. These gentlemen are the directors of our bank. Mr. Vivirani. - Hello. Mrs. Vivirani. - Greetings. Mrs. Jain. - Greetings. - Mr. Jain. - Hello. This is my wife. Less of a wife, that is, and more of a gambler. That's Mr. Sampat. As they say, God comes second.. ...but the wife's brother comes first. He used to be in the shipping business, which.. He's working with me nowadays. What do you know about ships, Mr. Shyam? I was born on a ship. I was into fishing earlier.. ...sleeping and waking up on the high seas. One of these vessels is called a ship. You will sink, all right. But you will take us along, too! You need to see the latest sea liners. You will be awe-struck, young man! They're a 5-star hotel on sea, with swimming pools, etc. Etc. My manners prevent me from laughing at you, sir. Whoever told you that I want to buy a luxury ship? I'm looking for a cargo vessel.. ...with deep-freezers and departments for cleaning and sorting out fish. For example, there are so many islands around Mauritius. Sea Union is one. Where they have a high standard of living. The most expensive thing here is rather cheap for them. The demand for fish far outperforms the supply. There are you. The wealth is there for the taking.. ...and we stand as mute spectators. Well said. Very well said. I must say. You have exceptional ideas and spirit. This is my daughter.. - My name is Rukmini. But I'm fondly called "Ruku." My name is Shyam. - I know. Dad's been praising you ever since he has returned from the bank. Leave him alone for a while, Shyam. The rich take time to give their nod of consent. Come on. How do you find the party? Are you enjoying? It's beautiful. I have dreams of making it big. I'll throw a lot of parties, too. You mustn't dream of that. - Why not? We have such parties every day. It's the same crowd, the same small talk, the same gossip. I'm quite sick of all this! And I've been dreaming of such a lifestyle for years. I used to like all this, too. But now, I've had quite enough of it. I'm fed up. Your arrival here today is like a whiff of fresh air in my life. Know when you feel like this? - When? When a beautiful girl grows up. The master wants you, madam. Shall we go? Did you send for us? - Yes. I have good news for Shyam. The directors of the bank have expressed an opinion in your favour. Your loan is as good as sanctioned. We can discuss the rest of the matter tomorrow. I don't want the loan anymore, sir. I've changed my mind. You said this man was fast.. but he's turned out to be "express." Yes! First time you're right! Hi dad! Hi mummy! - Come, dear. How about some tea? You're always out.. Where have you been? I have asked you a question. Notice her silence? This is rather personal, mom. Looks like our daughter has fallen in love, Renu. "Colours ..red, yellow, yellow, green, blue.. Blue." "Colours..red, yellow, yellow, green, blue.. Blue." "I was wearing a dress and it was the time of colourful Holi." "You did an injustice to me." "Made me fall in love." "I got lost in your love." "I will get new clothes stitched for you.. ...you have become 16 years old now." "You did an injustice to me." "Made me fall in love." "A bullet was fired without a gun!" "I was wearing new clothes." "No, no.. No, no.. No, no, no, no." "No, no.. No, no.. No, no, no, no." "The season is colourful." "The season of colours has arrived." "The season is colourful. The season of colours has arrived." "Everyone is talking about our love." "Everyone is talking about our love." "The people have now started talking about us." "The people have now started talking about us." "You have made me restless, made me fall in love." "I was embarrassed a lot." "I was wearing new clothes." "I won't be able to live without you, beloved." "I won't be able to live without you, beloved." "Your beloved will soon come with a palanquin." "Your beloved will soon come with a palanquin." "You did an injustice to me. Made me fall in love." "A bullet was fired without a gun!" "I will get new clothes stitched for you.. ...you have become 16 years old now." "You did an injustice to me." "Made me fall in love." "I was embarrassed a lot." "I was wearing new clothes." Good afternoon. What are you doing in the office? Aren't you out, playing colours? You know I'm a low-caste, sir. Who'd play with me? I'll play colours with you! To hell with the world! The papers might be ruined, sir. - So let them be ruined. They've very important, sir. What's so important about them? I wanted to give you a surprise, sir. You're getting a loan of 10 million from a big financial house, sir. You can buy the ship! Really? - I've got to submit the papers tomorrow. Hi Ruku! - What hi! You haven't changed yet! Still in the mood of colours? Come upstairs. - What for? Just come upstairs! Hurry up! What's up? You look very happy. It's about business. This is Mr. Gopal; my friend, philosopher and guide. Hello. - He didn't celebrate Holi today. He says, he's a low-caste; nobody plays with him. Could I play with the doll? - Sure. Get lost, you outcaste! Why did you scold the kid? These low-caste people are filthy, my dear. Don't ever play with them. What happened? I'm a low-caste, sir. What nonsense! What's wrong, Ruku? Can't you see? My car isn't starting up. I could push it.. If you wish. Yes. Please. How will a poor man push the car of a rich? Call someone else then! It's the festival of Holi and it's a holiday. I could call Mr. Gopal, if you wish. Call anyone! Give it a thought. He's an untouchable. All right, I'll call him over. Mr. Gopal. Give me a hand, Mr. Gopal. Let's give her a push. It's quite light. Give yourself and the car a nice wash, okay?! You shouldn't be fighting with her for me.. Do you want to know how much I respect you? Come with me. We lived in the slums, before I was born.. ...and even after I was born. My dad and uncle had a dream. Of owning a beautiful house. Unfortunately, however the dream died with them. To realize that dream I bought this house. And whenever I set my eyes on you, I remember my dad and uncle.. ...as if God had sent you to replace them. You must live in this house now. It will make me feel.. ...as if dad and uncle live here. But.. But sir... Please don't refuse. Or it will break my heart. Very well, sir. But I have a request, sir. Please make up with Rukmini. She loves you very much. I'd have laughed it off had she insulted me. But I can't tolerate someone insulting a man I respect. I'm not playing around with her either. I love her! We the out-castes, have borne these insults for ages, sir. We are used to it. I can't tolerate anyone insulting you in my presence. If she truly loves me.. ...she'll have to accept you, too. What are you doing, dad?! Guess who played colour with me? - Who did? Mr. Shyam! Yes! He changed the world for me today. He has given us a beautiful bungalow. But there was an episode which marred the happiness, Radha. What happened? - Rukmini arrived there. Who's Rukmini? She's a beautiful girl.. Shyam loves her very much. What? She loves him too. I see. Yes.. But why are you worried? What was that you said about the happiness being married? Mr. Shyam happened to pay me a bit more attention. And she was pretty angry. - You're really dumb, dad! Am I? Of course. You must've stayed put there. Yes. Had you gone away, they'd have patched up. You upset things, didn't you? I'll do something now. Is this why you got my father to name me Radha? So I'd live up to my name, even if my desires remained unfulfilled? Its okay, Lord. Love appears in many forms. Love is worship; Love is prayer. Stop worrying about me. And heed my prayer. Shyam and Rukmini love each other very much. So bring them together and fill their lives with joy. Let Shyam have Rukmini's love.. ...and give me the right to worship Shyam. Won't you ask me in? Are you angry? Forgive me. You must seek forgiveness from Mr. Shyam. You should ask for forgiveness from Mr. Gopal. You perhaps don't know.. he's like a father to me. I'll apologize to him. But you must forgive me now. I can't stay away from you anymore, Shyam. I.. I love you. I.. I.. I love you Shyam! Are you sure the Trust will sanction a loan of 10 million? I'm sure, sir. The trustee was to arrive at 3 p.m., and it's already 3.30. Traffic problem, sir. He must be arriving. There he is. Come. - Congratulations, Mr. Shyam. The Trust has sanctioned your loan. Come to the office and collect your cheque, after signing the papers. Thank you, sir. Your Trust has given my dream its wings, by sanctioning the loan. This is only the beginning. You can even seek a loan of 100 million. We will always be around for you. I'm grateful for the trust you have shown in me. You are welcome. - Thank you, sir. - Let's go. Hi! - Hi! Mom wants to see you. - Why? Is everything okay? Let's go. I'll explain. What is all this about.. - Come with me! C'mon quick! Do have the orders sent, Mr. Gopal! "Perhaps she is thinking of my marriage." "Perhaps my marriage is being planned." "And that's why my mom has called you to meet her." "What did you say?" "Perhaps she is thinking of my marriage." "Perhaps my marriage is being planned." "And that's why my mom has called you to meet her." "Thinking I'm a lone bird.. thinking I'm a lone bird.." "She has set a trap for me." "And that's why your mom has called me to meet her." "Is that right?" - "No, no!" "Look, you come home at 4 o'clock." "Ask my hand in marriage, do not feel shy." "Look, you come home at 4 o'clock." "Ask my hand in marriage, do not feel shy." "You are dreaming about marrying me." "You are dreaming about stars in broad daylight!" "No, no, I don't want to drink tea. "- "Why, why?" "O my gosh! Forgive me!" "I love these traits of yours." "And that's why my mom has called you to meet her." - "No, no, no, no!" "Thinking I'm a lone bird, she has set a trap for me." "And that's why your mom has called me to meet her." "Do not love me, do not tease me like this." "Say yes to me and come home, you are under my oath." "Do not love me, do not tease me like this." "Say yes to me and come home, you are under my oath." "Beloved, I agree I love you a lot." "Loving is alright but I am afraid of marriage." "Everything seems good before marriage." "Then one has to repent the whole lifetime." "I love these traits of yours." "And that's why my mom has called you to meet her." "Thinking I'm a lone bird, she has set a trap for me." "And that's why your mom has called me to meet her." "Hey, no dear." "Perhaps she is thinking of my marriage." "And that's why my mom has called you to meet her." "You are under my oath.. you will come, right?" "No. Never." - "Yes." "I swear on you.. I will come!" Are you sure they've called me over? It looks as if they don't like me calling on them. Don't be silly, c'mon! Hi mummy! He couldn't believe that you wanted to meet him. Greetings. A man's inferiority complex takes time to fade away. Sure. And manners are something you learn gradually. Go and see if everything's okay in the house, Ruku. - Yes mummy. Sit down. - Sure. Sit down. We had to talk to you someday. So, the sooner we did it, the better. Have something. What a shame! Only illiterates eat with bare hands, young man! Those from high society use forks and knives. This is how.. If you're trying to tell me that I don't belong to your society.. I must tell you that I know that very well. I've told Ruku very often. But she says that it doesn't make any difference. There ill-mannered people, although they are well dressed.. ...and use forks and knives.. Ruku is still a kid, Shyam. But you are no kid. Name your price to get out of her life? I've heard that insult, and I am silent. What bigger proof do you need that I love your daughter? Your love for her cannot give her the luxuries.. ...and status she is used to. These things have become a habit for her. Habits can change, madam. Please don't worry. I give you my word. I will lay all these luxuries at your daughter's feet. What is a beggar capable of? Now listen, brother-in-law. You have no right to treat my guest like that. Ruku wasn't born to your sister. She's my daughter. And my orders are still followed here! Apologize to him.. he will be my son-in-law. I have agreed to this marriage. Dad, I love you! Let's have a photograph. Join us, Mr. Gopal. Everything's alright? You've have made good arrangements here, Renu. This is the grandest reception we've had in Mauritius. I've done my best, Shanti. I'm the bride's stepmother, you see. I didn't want people to pick holes in this and that.. - 'Neelu!' Excuse me. Accountant.. You do look happy today. I am, sir.. But I'm sorry. I didn't recognize you. I'm known to break stones with a piece of glass. I'm Rukmini's uncle. The name is Sampat. Sampatlal. Okay.. - Greetings. I'm pleased to meet you. Obviously. You would be. Your boss has married a rich girl after all. She's not just rich, sir. She's a very good girl, too. Just about anyone can marry a good girl, accountant. But few are married to the rich. Your boss has married Rai sir's daughter.. ...and is already dreaming of inheriting his millions. But you know, I'm famous for breaking stones with glass. What happened to you? - I broke my leg. Tell me. How did Shyam and Rukmini look as a couple? They looked as if they were made for each other. Then what the book said is true. - What did it say? You don't read at all! I'm the librarian who does all the reading. The book said that marriage is a lifelong relationship. And this relationship is made in heaven. To start our lives together.. I've bought this new bungalow. My dreams and aspirations.. all lie in that house. Here you are. Bless your daughter-in-law, mom. And tell her how I'm longing for a cute little daughter. You will give me a cute little daughter very soon, won't you? I'm so happy, Shyam! I was fed up of my life earlier. But your love is like the ocean. I don't feel like coming out of it. How about making the ocean? These experiences of love that I have been through.. ...were all alien to me, Shyam. Every moment has brought a new feeling. I am proud to be your wife. I want to give you all the happiness in life, Ruku. I want to make it so big.. ...that should destiny have overlooked some happiness for us.. I want to buy that and lay it at your feet. Shyam has another name, you know? What is that? - My work. I must live for your happiness, Shyam. That's like a good girl! How about a dip in the seas? - No, Shyam. I'd rather plunge into your arms.. not the seas. The team of experts from Paris has arrived, sir. They're waiting outside. Shall I inform them of a meeting tomorrow? No. They've travelled a great distance. Let's hold the meeting today. - But, sir.. It's almost 8. It's only the second day of your wedding. Your wife must be waiting for you. You very well know that work is a passion for me. I am sorry to interrupt, gentlemen. My..My boss got married only yesterday. Its already 11.30. So.. Would you mind too much if we continue the meeting tomorrow? Time.. 12.15. This is no time to come home! Simple.. A man who's married a day ago.. ...returns home at midnight.. ...it's obvious that his wife will be mad at him! That's what I told the foreigners! That there's a vast difference in our culture and theirs. We Indians have a lot to do to make up with an angry wife. We've got to make her feel worshipped.. revered.. ...and welcomed with roses! "Mother-in-law is like a pilgrimage. Father-in-law is like a pilgrimage." "Mother-in-law is like a pilgrimage. Father-in-law is like a pilgrimage." "Brother-in-law and sister-in-law are like pilgrimages too." "All pilgrimages of the world are nothing compared to my wife." "My wife is like a pilgrimage." "Mother-in-law is like a pilgrimage. Father-in-law is like a pilgrimage." "Brother-in-law and sister-in-law are like pilgrimages too." "All pilgrimages of the world are nothing compared to my wife." "My wife is like a pilgrimage." "When a wife gets angry, one remembers sister-in-law." "When a wife gets angry, one remembers sister-in-law." "Brother-in-law likes sister-in-law whether she's fair or dark." "But there's neither a brother-in-law nor a sister-in-law in my fate." "My wife is like a pilgrimage." "My wife is like a pilgrimage." "Mother-in-law is like a pilgrimage. Father-in-law is like a pilgrimage." "Brother-in-law and sister-in-law are like pilgrimages too." "All pilgrimages of the world are nothing compared to my wife." "My wife is like a pilgrimage." "A wife with an attitude is a good wife." "A wife with an attitude is a good wife." "She looks cute when she abuses." "I don't know about you." "I don't know about you." "But mine is very lovely." "My wife is like a pilgrimage." "My wife is like a pilgrimage." "Mother-in-law is like a pilgrimage. Father-in-law is like a pilgrimage." "Brother-in-law and sister-in-law are like pilgrimages too." "All pilgrimages of the world are nothing compared to my wife." "My wife is like a pilgrimage." "Say! Hail my wife!" "Say! Hail my wife!" "And say ours too...!" "No, no, no, no, hail to my wife!" He has Ruku under this trance and landed a slap in our face. If I don't make Ruku slap him someday.. ...I'll never boast about my name again. You're right. Shyam has married our money, not Ruku. But don't you worry. He won't get a penny from here, so long as I'm around. In fact, I'll strip him of whatever he has. I'm known for breaking stones with glass. What are you doing here, dear? We thought we wouldn't be seeing you for a couple of months. That you'd be honeymooning in London, Paris.. No. We aren't going anywhere on a honeymoon, uncle. Why not? A team of experts has arrived from France.. And Shyam has no time at all. Won't my only daughter even have a honeymoon? And I had such great ideas. The things I planned for them! I suggest you spend the money on their honeymoon. Book hotels all over the world and send them two air-tickets. And see how he doesn't find the time. Our darling daughter is not going to have these times again! Thanks, uncle. I'll go and see dad now. - Okay. This is only the first of spark in a haystack. What do you mean? I'm known for breaking stones with glasses! Hi sweetheart. - Hi Rukku. I'm watching the world map. Do you know why? - Why? I'm having a bedroom built on the new cargo-ship I've bought. Bed room. - A honeymoon cabin. We will go a world cruise on the ship.. ...and make the seven seas a witness to our love! It'll be our ship; our hard-work; our honeymoon.. ...everything on board will belong to us! And suppose I give you wings right now, will you fly with me? Of course, of course. With these tickets, we can fly to any corner of the world. Your mother and uncle must've made this arrangement, isn't it? They thought we'd get a free trip and take off on a honeymoon. And you were naive enough to accept the tickets and bring them here. I don't see anything wrong in this. So what if I've brought the tickets? Really? The wings that you buy with others' money.. ...drive you away from your home. And those who take to such wings, never come back home. Never! You're always complicating matters. You don't understand, Ruku. Your Mom and uncle have done this deliberately, to humiliate me! I don't agree with you, Shyam. I think it's your middle class mentality speaking. What? Well, all right. Maybe I have a third class mentality. But I will not tolerate this insult! Go and return those tickets immediately! Won't it insult my mom and uncle if I return the tickets to them? Who are you more bothered about? Is it them? Or me? You are being obstinate, Shyam! They did this only to make us happy. And you're turning it into a prestige issue! You will have to return the tickets instantly! It's the limit! I'm not going anywhere! Neither will I return the tickets nor go on a honeymoon! Baby. - Why did you change your program, dear? There were so many people to see you off at the airport last night. The roses they brought! You could call the aircraft a honeymoon plane! And we were terribly embarrassed. You should at least have told us that you were not leaving. Actually, Shyam's very busy attending to.. ...the experts' team from France. I told him to put it off. Work comes first, you see. Besides, you know how passionate Shyam is about his work. That is all right. But what are all these toys for? You don't even have a child yet. What madness is this? Shyam is crazy about children. He never had a sister. And so.. ...he's badly looking forward to having a baby girl. Wonderful! Great desires! What can I say now? Speak to her, sis. You are just married and you're already thinking of having babies. Don't make a mistake in haste. A baby so early would ruin your figure. I've seen it all! The moment you have a baby at home.. ...there's a change in the husband's attitude. Take my advise. Go in for an abortion. We're rid of the team of experts, at last. Let's eat at your place today. - Certainly, sir. I'll make some pancakes for you. That'll be fun. You? Doesn't your daughter do the cooking? She's found a job as a librarian, sir. The government has even given her quarters. I see. So, okay. We'll eat at my place in that case. But, sir.. Things have changed.. So has Ruku. She's anyway away at a party with her mom and will return late. So let's go. C'mon. C'mon! We will have some fun! C'mon. Stop it! How dare you enter my bedroom? I brought him in here, Ruku. We were hungry and so I had the food brought over. Even if you brought him here, why did he sit on the bed? Why didn't he remember that this is my bed.. ...and that he's an untouchable! Ruku. - She's right, sir. I should have remembered that I'm an untouchable. Mr. Gopal.. - Sir.. A dog must remember not to eat something.. ...if you happen to leave a vessel uncovered. Please forgive me. I'll never make this mistake again. You broke the poor man's heart, didn't you? You have severed his relations with this house. You can ahead and share relations, Shyam. I'm not even going to sleep on that bed anymore. Why didn't you return the car even after I asked you to? You perhaps don't know, Shyam. I've always got what I wanted. It's not right to invest money in cars, when the business needs it. And you know, the money I have is a loan. Who asked you for the money? You know my father. Don't bother. The car will be paid for. You get angry over every little thing. Why've you called me to the office? I have a surprise for you. We're taking an Air Mauritius flight to Paris this evening. What for? - We haven't had a honeymoon. So I thought, since I was attending a business conference there.. ...we could have a honeymoon and wrap up my work, too. Thank you very much, Shyam. But what's the hurry for a honeymoon? Finish your work first. We can have our honeymoon after a year or two. It's a very good idea. It's a very good idea. And why return the ticket for a few Rupees? I'd rather tear up your ticket. Who's the one who's playing with our lives? Who is it?! Don't you forget, that it is the people in this house.. Who have given you a real life. Or what life did you lead? - Mummy. I was very happy with the life I used to lead. I didn't have your bank balance slapping me in the face. I didn't have it always belittling me and my pride! Always remember. She's no longer your daughter. She's my wife, my honour and my pride! By spoiling her, you are spoiling my life! What happened, Shyam? Ruku was given a million Rupees.. ...And my family was thrust into the furnace of destruction. She has gambled with your money today. But soon.. - Shyam. My daughter has so much of money.. ...that she could buy out your entire future! I suggest you set right your own present. Buying our people's future can always come later. You have never been a good wife. But I didn't expect you to be such a bad mother! You are insulting me for this insignificant man! You are insulting me by calling my son-in-law an insignificant man! By getting your daughter into the dirty of gambling! Mothers like you have a lot to regret. Remember that. And fathers like you can give their children happiness.. ...only after they are dead! Please don't say such things, mom. May God give Papa a thousand years to live. I love you, papa. Did you hear that? Ruku's not bad at heart. Will you agree to a suggestion? Your wish is my command, sir. Ruku will inherit everything upon my death. But you must have noticed how childish and immature she is. So I want you to invest my money in your business. You know very well that I'd never accept a loan from you. In that case, make Ruku your partner. A man can't take his own decisions in a partnership, sir. You cannot obey my orders. Can you do me a favour then? Please, sir. Do not belittle yourself. Anything you say is the writ of God for me. Hello. - Hello Father? This is Radha here. Oh, hello. Go on. I've got my first salary today. I want to spend it on Mr. Shyam and Rukmini. Invite them for lunch, will you? All right.. Just hold on. It's Radha, sir. She has got her first salary today. She couldn't attend your wedding.. ...so she wants you and your wife to join us for lunch. But.. I'll bring Rukmini over. We'll certainly have lunch with you. It's okay.. They're coming over for lunch. - Thank you, papa. Thank you very much. I've committed something on your behalf, Ruku. Everything you say is okay with me. So get dressed soon. We've got to go over for lunch. Where to? - You have already promised me. So why question me? Okay, let's go. I knew you wouldn't refuse. So I'll tell you. Mr. Gopal and.. - What?! Eat at Gopal's place? That untouchable?! I can't stand the man! How will I eat with him?! At least hear me out. I will listen to nothing. This is the desire of an innocent person. To hell with such desires! I've given them my word. You can always say that your partner wasn't willing. I haven't asked for much, Ruku. Neither did I expect you to ask for something so petty. I won't go with you. Period! And remember.. You're not the only owner anymore. You have an equal partner. "Life is a song of love." "Everyone has to sing it." "Life is a song of love." "Everyone has to sing it." "Life is also about sadness." "One has to smile and overcome it." "Whatever one sows here, he reaps accordingly." "Whatever one sows here." "He reaps accordingly." "If one does not get happiness in life.. ...one has to adjust accordingly with sadness." "Life is a song of love." "Everyone has to sing it." "Doesn't matter if your goals seem far off." "Doesn't matter if the road ahead is difficult." "Doesn't matter if your goals seem far off." "Doesn't matter if the road ahead is difficult." "Even if one doesn't achieve his goals, one has to hope for the best." "Life is a song of love." "Everyone has to sing it." "Life is also a dilemma." "It keeps company both during happiness and sadness." "Life is also a dilemma." "It keeps company both during happiness and sadness." "Life is also a promise." "Everyone has to fulfill it." "Life is a song of love." "Everyone has to sing it." "Life is also about sadness. One has to smile and overcome it." Mr. Shyam! Come on in! Are you Radha? - That's right. That was a beautiful song you were singing. "Life, the ocean of sorrows.." You have tears in your eyes. - Tears of joy, actually. Good afternoon, sir! Have you come alone? Yes. She took ill at the last moment. Please come in, sir. Sit down. I know so much about you, thanks to Dad.. That I think even you'd lag behind me in this respect! Really? How much do you know me? - So much! Excuse me. Dad praises you so much! You'd be thrilled to know! No thank you. I'd rather keep my senses. Dad says you a very ambitious man. You want to fly higher than the skies. One needs inspiration to fulfill his dreams, Radha. You wouldn't lack that with Rukmini around. Yes.. I don't lack it at all. There seems to be a storm raging in your heart. A storm you are trying to control. But you can't stop it. I could stop a single storm.. But there are thousands of them in my heart. Never mind that. Let's talk about something else. How will you talk about anything else.. ...when you're not at peace with yourself? So, how do I find peace? By giving me all your sorrows. Give you?! No. I can't do that. It's my burden. I must bear it. You must share the burden, when it gets to be too much. I haven't asked for your joys. I seek your sorrows. Can't you give me even that? What have you been talking about? - Nothing much, dad. Your dad says you work at the MGI library. Yes. I'm a librarian. Are we only going to talk? Won't you give us some food? I don't feel like going away, but I must. That was a wonderful song; the food was good, too. But what is best.. ...are you folks and your feeling of belonging. Greetings, sir. Where are you going? - To fetch medicines for your wife. Medicines? What happened, Ruku? What's happened to her? - You don't have to scream. She's a bit off weather. The gynecologists' are examining her. A gynecologist? Is it good news then? It is good news, isn't it? Actually.. ...it was necessary to conduct the operation. Operation? What operation? When was she operated? I'm sorry, Mr. Shyam. But you have taken no precautions. Precautions? What precautions are you talking about? The post-operation precautions. What operation was it? What's wrong with Ruku? This is surprising, Mr. Shyam. You ought to know everything. Ruku didn't want a baby for 4 or 5 years. So we did a vasectomy on her. But she did not take any of the precautions I had recommended. Rukmini spent 8 hours every day at the swimming pool. As a result of which.. As a result of which? Go on. She can't bear a child anymore. Faith is the biggest bond between man and wife. And you have betrayed my trust! You have betrayed my faith in you! Can't you see? She's ill. And you're bothering her! Don't interfere. I'm talking to my wife! You must care for the patient, Mr. Shyam. Could you please go out now? Please? Have you seen what your daughter-in-law has done, mom? You were lucky to die early.. Or you'd never have been able to bear the shock! There will be no child in this house anymore. We will never have a daughter. You are worried about the baby and not your wife! You are a cheap and selfish man! Your wife is lying ill. And you.. You are enacting a drama before that picture! What you have done with my life is worse than a drama! I will never forgive you for this. Go away, I say. Get out! I don't know why I was drawn here. I just came along. Sorry. Mr. Shyam? Are you in a hurry? Could you wait for 5 minutes? It's time for the library to close. Could I ask you something? - Go ahead. Why are you always at war with yourself? I'm not. Your face says it all. You are in conflict with yourself. I want to solve this conflict! But how do I do it? Smile. And your sorrows will go away. Smile. Please. Do you like watching football? Look at the irony for the football. It was made to be kicked around! Hey! Goal. Goal. I told you! No. 10 had to score! Attention: Please. The weather bureau has issued a warning. A cyclone is fast approaching Mauritius. The match has to be suspended. Spectators are advised to reach their homes as early as possible. Thank you. Thank you very much, Mr. Shyam. If it wasn't for the storm, I'd have offered you some coffee. But the warning has been issued. You have a 40-minute drive ahead. So I won't stop you. Take care! You are always sitting pretty! Come to drop me sometimes... ...and I'd worship the ground You tread on. You are omniscient, Lord. Shyam came with a storm in his heart today. Do give him peace of mind, Lord. Shyam, I am sorry. I know you are very angry with me. What do we share anymore? Don't say such things, Shyam. It's true. I didn't want to have a baby for 4 or 5 years. But... I didn't ever imagine that I'd never be able to bear a child. I regret what I have done. I don't know why, but I was misled by my mother. I am sorry, Shyam. What will regret and apologies do now? This is precisely the difference between a mother and stepmother. She didn't let you be a wife, nor become a mother. She has turned you into an object of sex and lust! Shyam! This body that you possess... ...is no longer the sacred embodiment of two souls in love. Shyam. You are insulting me! It is you who has insulted me and my love! You have defiled even your body... ...that deserved the exalted status of a mother! You are talking a lot of nonsense! You are heaping abuses on me! I'm not just your wife... I'm a woman, too! You have abused the pride of your wife! You have abused a woman's honor! It is actually your arrogance at work, Shyam. It is your money that is doing the talking! You are no longer the man I had loved. Only when God once again brings you back to being a fisherman... ...maybe you will deserve my love. God will straighten you out! He will avenge me! Hello. What happened, Gopal? We are doomed! The new ship we had bought, has sunk. The entire crew is missing. Send helicopters and rescue-teams... save as many you can! I've done all that, sir. But there has been no response. Try again! Hello. - Hello. Yes.. We are doomed, Mr. Gopal. The helicopters and the rescue teams have returned. No one has survived. - My God. Even the insurance of the ship had expired. Won't you even ask me... ...what I've been doing these days and nights in the office? I'm used to all this now. I know your other passion; work. There is a time even for taunts and jibes, Ruku. I have returned home a broken man. I am not taunting you. And I'm not interested in picking up any fights. I've got to attend a party and I'm already late. Despite what I've told you... ...will you still go to the party? Come on Shyam. Stop talking in riddles and tell me what's happened. Our ship that was headed here... ran into rough weather... ...it has sunk. So what's wrong? We can claim the insurance. The insurance cover had expired. The entire crew on the ship was killed. No one has survived. I'm sorry about those killed, Shyam. As for the insurance cover... ...any company with people like Mr. Gopal at its helm of affairs... ...will meet with the same fate. Anyway, see you later. Must you go to the party? It's the Governor's party. When I accepted the invitation to attend the party... I didn't know your ship would sink. You know now. You know too, these people of high society. How they take offense when one doesn't attend their parties. You are worried about the high-society... ...but you don't care for those whose wives and children... ...are widowed and orphaned! I told you I'm sorry! What else can I do? Must I mourn those whom I have never even met nor known? Must I sit in mourning with you? No. You must rejoice, Ruku. Tonight is celebration time for you! What do you mean? God has listened to the curses you hurled at me! These taunts of yours do pierce the heart, Shyam! The cyclone's going to hit the city! There's been a warning! Announces warning to no.3, people of Mauritius.. ...are requested to stay inside.. Where are you off to, sir? There's been a third warning! ...With a speed of 200 kilometers, it is coming. Why did you venture out in this storm? Something could have happened to you. The storm back home was worse than this one. So I came over. A ship of ours sank today. Oh my God! Every member of the crew is dead. Not one survived. I couldn't bear to see.. ...the plight of their widows and children. Where are you going? I must leave. You faced dangers to arrive here... ...but I'm not going to let you go out in the stormy night. Try to understand, Radha! No matter what! I will not let you endanger your life. For my sake, Mr. Shyam! You may leave, after the storm abates. The storm will pass, and so will the night... ...but what will you do if this is called a sinful night? Merely giving it a name will not make it a sinful night! But who will understand our relationship, Radha? Had there been someone else here, even your dad... I'd have stayed back. And what if I give you a greater witness than my dad? There he is... the biggest of all witnesses. Who is it? I'm the one. I break stones with a piece of glass. Whom do you wish to meet? The gentleman I wish to see is in there. Shyam. There was a cyclone last night.. ...Since you didn't return, everybody was worried. I was looking for you .. ...and I saw your car in a bad shape. I was scared. But I see now... ...you are pretty comfortable here. Will you go out for a moment? Sure. Step into some clothes. I'll wait for you. Radha. My life is surrounded by storms. If I need you again... ...may I come over? As Rukmini's husband, my doors will always be open for you. Greetings, uncle. Greetings. Miss Rukmini... Please don't be formal. I'm like your daughter. Call me Ruku. What are you doing at a poor man's place... You're being formal again! I've come to apologize for all my mistakes. I'm terribly ashamed at what I have done, uncle. No, dear. You are like my daughter, Radha. Isn't she in? - Who? Radha? Yes. I've come to invite you to a party at my place this evening. Invite me? - Yes, uncle. I realize now. There are no castes. There is nothing like untouchability. Besides, Radha and you happen to be a part of Shyam's life. Would it be okay for us to attend the party? You're going to have so many big personalities there. So you haven't forgiven me. No. That's not true, dear. For Radha's sake, uncle. You must bring her along, too. I will prove it to everyone... ...that the low-castes are worthy of worship. Please don't tell Shyam that I have invited you. Let's give him a surprise. That's a good one. That's a good one - Shyam. I invited them. To surprise you. Isn't that nice? Well, of course. Greetings, madam. Greetings, sir. - Greetings Mr. Gopal. So this is Radha? - Yes. This is for you. Thank you. Bihari... please take this bouquet. Radha is young and beautiful, uncle. Haven't you got her married yet? No. It's difficult to find a nice boy for educated girls in our community. In which case, she must have her eyes on a wealthy family. Waiter. Whiskey? I don't drink. Perhaps not openly. Could I have it mixed with Coca-Cola? No thank you. I really don't drink. Oh! I see. What kind of behavior is that? Have you invited them here to insult them? Don't say such things, darling. I was taking "special" care of a "special" guest. Please don't misunderstand me. Uncle... please come. My husband will look after he. Come. Have a drink. - Thank you. I don't drink. She doesn't drink. And you don't either. - No. Well... I'll have this drink. Cheers everybody - Cheers. What will her guests think if you say something to her now? Please don't say anything to her till the party is over. For my sake! Somebody said you've arranged for a cabaret tonight, Rukmini. The cabaret artiste has ditched me. Oh no - Don't worry. Don't worry. I must present a special act for "special" guests. Very Good. "The heart breaks when loved ones ditch." "The heart breaks when loved ones ditch." "Why do you cry when the heart breaks?" "Why do you cry when the heart breaks?" "Why don't we sing? Why don't we sing?" "When loved ones.. The heart breaks when loved ones ditch." "Dear, You are a saviour or a human." "I have seen loved ones change their attitudes." "Dear, You are a saviour or a human." "I have seen loved ones change their attitudes." "See the anger. My lover is ditcher." "See the anger. My lover is ditcher." "When loved one, the heart breaks when loved ones ditch." "When loved one, the heart breaks when loved ones ditch." "The person I loved, broke my heart." "For someone else he let me go." "The person I loved, broke my heart." "The person I loved, broke my heart." "I have no qualms. I am no less." "I have no qualms. I am no less." "The heart breaks, when loved ones ditch." "The heart breaks, when loved ones ditch." "They have decorated the party." "Even I play with them." "Why should I be left behind?" "Even I play with them. Why should I be left behind." "I know you. Now, I will know." "I know you. Now, I will know." "When loved one? The heart breaks when loved one ditches?" "When loved one? The heart breaks when loved one ditches?" "When the heart breaks, Why do you cry?" "When the heart breaks, why do you cry? I don't have anyone." "Why don't we sing? Why don't we sing?" "When loved one? The heart breaks when loved one ditches?" "When loved one? The heart breaks when loved one ditches?" How dare you touch my wife? Somebody had to only touch me... and you're all fired up! And what did I go through when you spent a night with another woman? Do you know that? What are you talking about? Which woman? And which night? Which woman indeed! Swear it on her head! Did you or did you not... ...spend the stormy night of August 9, with this woman? But, Rukmini... - Shut up! I've put that question to him! Speak up! Answer me! Did you not spend the night with her? Yes. I did spend the night there. But that was one night that was brighter than the day. Radha and I were there, too. Radha was on one side and I on the other... and the night... it simply passed between us. Do not use words to cover up your dirty deeds, Shyam! Swear it on her! Don't you love her? Yes, I do! Open the door, Papa! Open the door! Papa! Open the door! You? At this hour? Shyam is all right, I hope? - Don't even utter his name! I've walked out of his house for good! You should not have left the house, Ruku. Since you object to my leaving the house... ...you must ask me why I have done it. Why? Shyam has an untouchable woman.. ...for his mistress. No... Shyam would never do a thing like this! Shyam... have you heard what Ruku is saying? That's not true, dad. Ruku has walked out of my house. And I've come to take her back. What is better proof of my love for her? You've heard that, Ruku. He swore in the presence of all the guests at the party today. He placed his hand on her head... ...and admitted that he's having an affair with her. This is between man and wife, Ruku. We can sort it out at home. Let's go home, Ruku. Take that woman home who's having fun at my daughter's expense! Why must you take my daughter to your house? Keep out of this! He's here to take his wife home. And he has the right to it! As if he alone has all the rights! Ask your daughter... ...will she go back? - She will, of course. How will she go back, brother-in-law? Ruku knows. I have seen Shyam. ...with Radha in her bedroom. I can't say more, it's embarrass... - Hold that dirty tongue! You have always stopped us from speaking out. Don't you realize? He has ensnared Ruku, only for your wealth! What have the two of you given me except sorrows? And now, you are bent on breaking Ruku's home! For the last time, Ruku. Go to your house! My foot, she will! I won't let her go! Is this what I have been reduced to?! What happened, dad? You push him into the jaws of death and ask what happened! Get out... get the hell out of my sight! Ask the root of all the evil to get out! I beg of you... Not another word.. Please call the doctor. Please. Monica. Papa. This is all your doing, you scoundrel! You are making a false accusation. Please step aside... ...and let me pay my last respects. Don't you dare touch him with those dirty hands! Just once, Ruku... ...let me touch his feet. I beg of you. Why are you acting like a beggar? Get lost! Guard! Throw him out! I said, get out! We can't stay here another minute. After all the mudslinging we have been subjected to... ...we can't face anyone. We will leave immediately. And where will we go? I have a job. And so do you. I can't continue with Mr. Shyam's job anymore. Why not? Why must you quit the job? And what have I done? Do you suspect my chastity too? Even if I believe it, no one else in the world will! Rukmini will never believe it. But Rukmini (from the epics) has always been suspicious of Radha. She was always suspicious of Radha's sacred relations with Lord Krishna. As for the world, it did not even spare a chaste woman like Sita. Sita had to go through a test by fire to prove her chastity. What test will you go through? - Any test you subject me to. So let's leave this place. And walk out of Shyam's life. Far away. Where Rukmini and Shyam don't even get to hear of us. Radha. - Shyam. Wait, Radha. Please open the door, Mr. Gopal! No. This door will not be opened. The world has shut its doors on me. At least you mustn't. The Gopal you knew was your employee. And this Gopal happens to be a girl's father. I will not open the door! Radha! Make him see reason. Please! Open the door, please father. No. I will not open the door for him. It's Rukmini's husband who has come here, Radha. Will you now open the door? Radha. Please, father. That man is suffering! He carries a storm in his heart. I beg of you, father! For a little while... please! No... I won't. "Life is a song of Love." "Which every heart has to sing." "Life is a song of Love." "Which every heart has to sing?" "Life is ocean of sorrow." "With a smile we will have to go across." "Life is a feeling." "Life is a feeling for a broken heart." "Life is a feeling for a broken heart. "heart." "Life is a pilgrimage." "All will have to go through it." "Life is a song of love." "Which every heart has to sing?" "So what if life is cruel. So what if our own are angry." "So what if life is cruel. So what if our own are angry." "So what if our hands are not together." "Still, we will have to be together." "Life is a song of love." "Which every heart has to sing?" "Life is a smile." "A symbol of pain." "Life is a smile." "A symbol of pain." "Life is guest." "Who has to go one day?" "Life is a song of love." "Which every heart has to sing?" "Life is a ocean of sorrow." "With a smile we will have to go across." Please read my father's will. I, Prannath Pasha, son of Vinod Kumar Pasha... hereby entrust all my properties... ...my estates and financial companies and all my belongings... ...jointly to my daughter Rukmini and her husband, Shyam Mohit. Should my son-in-law meet with an accident and die... ...or in the event of my son-in-law divorcing my daughter... ...all my property shall then belong to my daughter, Rukmini. My wife, Renu Prannath Pasha, is my daughter's stepmother. She shall have no right to my property. She ought to be given Rs.2000 every month, to cover her expenses. My brother-in-law who is the PRO of our company... ...be immediately removed from his post. His salary of Rs.5000 be stopped immediately, too. Instead, he be given 200 Rupees every month, as expenses. What are you talking about? You must surely be mistaken! Please read that again! He be given 200 Rupees every month, as expenses. I have no right to your father's property, all right. But he has done an injustice to my sister! Uncle, Mummy... please don't worry. I own all the properties and estates now. But who have I, except for the two of you? Bless you, dear! We have always been your own! I have even unearthed a secret nobody knows about! Which secret, uncle? Shyam did not want to borrow money from your father, to buy that ship. But your father floated an imaginary trust... and lent Shyam millions to buy as many as four vessels! This lawyer is himself the Trustee of that trust. Tell her, Mr. Lawyer... How much does Shyam owe the trust? We have the accounts. In all, he owes 1230 million.. ...in principal and interest. So how will you recover the money from Shyam? Attachment. What will you attach? He has distributed most of the money... ...to the families of those who died in the ship-collapse. He still has some properties in his name. We can recover some of our money by attaching those properties. We must move with an attachment immediately. Exactly. We must move, before he sells the rest of his property. If you wish to have Shyam's properties attached, Rukmini.. ...put your signature on this authority letter. This is Shyam. Serve the attachment orders on him. All his ships, boats, houses .. ...and bank accounts have been seized. And now you get out of the ship. I'm famous for breaking stones with glasses. Keep it. Open the door, guard. You are not allowed inside. Why? - Your mother-in-law's orders. You had forgotten something very dear to you. And you'd really have missed it. So, I've come to return your car. Take the keys of the car from him, guard. Your father has left behind a flourishing business, madam. Be careful how you handle it. Anything could happen to it in wrong hands. I don't need your opinion. I know what I've got to do. You're right. These are papers of some properties... .about which even you know nothing. If you can't recover your father's money from the things attached... ...please recover it from this. And what do you want in return? What can be greater wealth than happiness? I came to give you something, madam. Not to take away anything. Why do you have this additional plate laid, madam? Nobody joins you to eat. We are here, aren't we? And at the right time, too! Hello uncle, Hello mummy. Hello baby - Will you have some food? - Certainly. Please take that chair, uncle. Let this be vacant. You'll get another plate. - Okay. Are you expecting someone, dear? Shyam has to return some day, hasn't he? Wonderful! She's still expecting Shyam to return! Expect the man who found another woman for himself? He must've even married by now. I don't believe it. You will. In a couple of months. The lawyer thinks we have waited enough. We must file for divorce. But I don't want a divorce! Whatever I have done is only to have Shyam back. Not to lose him. What happens when people get to know... that he married that untouchable despite your presence? That will be the last day of our relations, mummy. But I need proof! Proof! Certainly... I'll get you the proof. But we had better not give him the chance to humiliate us publicly. She's right! Before he can blacken our face... let's do away with him like a fly in a cup of milk! I'm sorry, uncle! I will do nothing without proof! Nothing! Never! Sampat, we're back where we started from! Don't you worry, sister. I'm famous. For breaking stones with glasses. Good evening Mr. Gopal. Good evening. How are you? You seem to be very angry Gopal sir. We have nothing to do with you anymore. No matter what happens... ...you just can't end your acquaintance like this. I've been looking for you. But I didn't know where you were. Where's Radha? Who is it, dad...? Radha! My dear! How are you? It's ages since I saw you! Please go away, I say. Do not be angry, Mr. Gopal. We're in trouble, too. Please help us. We can't bear Rukmini and Shyam's separation. We have nothing to do with anyone of you! That's okay... ...but will it be all right to see two innocent lives being ruined? Give it a thought, Radha. What can we do anyway? Rukmini's a victim of suspicion. And you are the only one who can rid her of the suspicion. How can I do that? - By getting married. What?! - You'll get married someday. But the only difference is, if you get married now... ...it'll save Shyam and Rukmini's house from destruction. Your marriage will act as evidence... ...to clear the misgivings from Ruku's heart. It will prove that you have nothing to do with Shyam! Do you take marriage to be a game children play? I can do anything to save Shyam and Rukmini's marriage. Give it a thought, Radha! Marriage is no farce. You can't get married to idols of clay! I'll find you a very good boy, Gopal. I'll bear the expenses of the wedding, too. Just you see... I'll find a gem of a boy for Radha. A gem. But.. - What will doubts get you, dad? To see their happiness restored to them... I'd do anything. To put their broken home together, I'd marry anyone, dad. You're risking your life without even giving it a thought. You don't need to make such a big sacrifice! This isn't a sacrifice, father. It's worship. Mr. Shyam?! In this state? Yes, Vijay. Leading a laborer's life has its own charm. Remember the boat you gave me, Mr. Shyam? Thanks to that... I own several of them today. I know, the company I work belongs to you, too. But I won't let you live like this anymore. I have a home, sir... a wife and a daughter. Please come and live with us. A daughter? Well... not today. But I will certainly come to see your daughter some day. How did all this happen, sir? I read about your family and business in the newspapers... People often come to a stage where they have to choose their own paths. I don't regret what I have gone through. I'm sad at what the poor Radha must have gone through. What state must she be in? Well... bye. Take care. Radha! Is Ruku all right? What dream are you talking of, Radha? I don't even remember what all that was. Didn't they call you back after I got married? You got married and had a kid... ...and you're dressed like a widow. What's all this about, Radha? Will you give me your sorrows today? What's been happening, Radha? I want to know... ...how and where you've been. The whole story. What will you gain by listening to my woeful tale? You will be hurt when you hear it. Do I have no right to know what you have been through? Tell me, Radha. Praise the Lord! Praise the Lord! Take off the turban, feller. We'll get a nice photograph. That's it. Smile. Smile. Have a sip and we'll make a trip to the heavens! Go on... Have some! - No. Drink it, I say... - No! No.. This is what happened for a few months. My dad was terribly upset. He bore it all silently. My husband used to leave for a day... ...and wouldn't return for days on end. He came only when he wanted the money. Give it to me! The father and daughter... make a lot of money, eh? How will we run the household if you take away all the money? Shut up, you old man! Don't you realize? I need money for my expenses, too. But it's the beginning of the month and we have to pay everyone. The milkman, the grocer... where will we buy food grains from? Are we to starve? Shut up, insolent man! You dare talk to me! Please! Don't do that! I'm willing to bear any atrocity. But give father his due respect. I beg of you. You can have all the money... but please don't say anything to my father! But please don't say anything to my father! I was willing to face anything... He was my husband and I never ever took a dig at him. I never ever stopped him from doing what he wanted to. Then, one day. I'm carrying your baby... - What?! You are pregnant. Who asked you to bear a child? It's difficult to maintain you and your father... ...and you're bringing in the baby too! A baby is a gift of God. Shameless bitch! Is it a gift from God... ...or is it from your lover? What? What did you say? Where do you meet the bastard? Tell me! Where do you meet Shyam... tell me! Speak up! No, no, for God's sake... don't accuse me like this. Don't drag Shyam into this... This is your baby! You're trying to shield your lover, you bitch! After this I don't want to see your face. I won't let you stay here. Son-in-law! Please don't hit her! Please don't hit to Radha. Hit me instead! My father couldn't take all this. He went looking for my husband... ...and decided the matter once and for all. Are you mad? Gunwantlal is my husband! We have three children! Bloody cheat! Swine! You have ruined my daughter's life! I'll have you sent to prison! You have got to know more than you should have, old man. You shouldn't be allowed to live anymore. Are you very tired, dad? Father...! Father...! No, father! Father! "That which should not have happened, has occurred." "You are a widow now." For my sake, for my happiness... you went through all this. What relations do we share, Radha? Not even Lord Krishna and Radha could define the relationship. All I know is that... ...you are perhaps husband to Ruku. But you're my God. I have only worshipped you. But this worship has charred your life, Radha. That's not true. Even the burns you suffer in worship are soothing. Doctor - Yes - Please. Congratulations. It's a baby-girl. She's coming, sister. Why are you crying, mummy? What's the matter? What happened? Why's she crying, uncle? It is just what we feared, dear. Shyam has defamed our family. He has really slapped us in the face. Has he married her then? He hasn't just married her. They even have a baby. A baby-girl. He played with the baby and said... - he'd have his revenge from you! God Almighty! I had to shut my ears after that! But we kept our eyes open... because we've got to make you see the truth. Give me! Do you believe us now? My life is an open book, Your Honor. I performed every duty, even in the face of adversity and insults. Today the truth lies before you. Unexposed. Your Honor. Truth has always triumphed in this Temple of Justice. And I see victory for the truth from you today. We have all the evidence of his second marriage, Your Honor. We wish to present it in court. Certainly do so. But only tomorrow. Your honor.. Please grant bail for my client, Mr. Shyam. Bail is granted. The court is adjourned until tomorrow. Dear. Have all the fun tonight, young man. Once the court has all the evidence tomorrow... ...you're going to spend all your nights behind the bars. I'm famous. For breaking stones with glasses. Well done. Very well done. Thank you so much. - Thank you. Thank you. - Welcome. - Thank you. Bye-bye. - Bye-bye. Who is it? You?! Come! Come! Please come in! Sit down. Please sit down. I'm here to meet Shyam. Not to sit down. Please call him. - Of course. Mr. Shyam... come on out! Your happiness and joys have returned! Hurry up. Give the baby to me. She won't let you talk. I've come to take you back. - What will you take back now? I don't want you to lead a life with an untouchable like Radha. Don't get me wrong, Shyam... you mustn't stoop so much. I'm willing to compromise for you. Please come back to me. A woman who is suspicious can never belong to anyone, Ruku. I'm willing to concede every truth. But I can't bear to see you living in these conditions. Why not? It was you who had said... ...that the day I turn an ordinary fisherman again... ...you will want that day. And look! I am what you wished I'd be. You forget, Shyam. I had also said... ...that I would love you all over again. Return with me, Shyam. That's good for you. The life that you led. The person that you were. I am happy with what I am and where I am, Ruku. It's your injured pride that is speaking, Shyam. Was it your love that spoke up in court? All that can be changed in court, provided you belong to me! When did I not belong to you? Ever since you got married to Radha! Marry Radha? I?! What are you talking about? Don't show me your anger to hide the truth. Leave Radha. And come with me. I'll let you have everything. Give me something, if you can. What? - A divorce. I want a divorce. I know why you want a divorce! But I will not give it to you. Proof of your second marriage will be presented in court tomorrow! And you will land behind bars! Rukmini! Rukmini! What happened? Why did she walk out in a huff? She was here to take you back, wasn't she? She asked for a very big price in exchange for my return. You should've settled for any price. She's your wife, after all. A wife is considered to be a man's companion in virtue. But what does man do if she herself accuses him of sin? Sin? But.. What does this photograph mean? What kind of a deception is this? I'm not worried about what happens to me, Radha. But I must fight this deception and fabrication! So that this picture does not cast a slur on you, in court tomorrow. I'm not more important than your lives, Shyam. I'm willing to take any slur. Now that a falsehood has donned the guise of reality... I will give it a status that it be nothing but the truth. I will marry you, Radha. No! No Shayam babu no. If you do that, the Lord will be called a cheat! Never mind that. Let anything happen. No! I won't let you do that! You will really sin if you do that! So be it. Before I am punished, I will anoint your forehead. I will give this innocent child my name... ...so you can defy society and lead a respectable life. My respect lies not in marrying you. It lies in uniting you with Rukmini and in the happiness you find. A woman keeps her husband. She does not defeat him in courts. I'll go and fetch the priest. No, Shyam... listen to me! Don't do that! Mr. Shyam... hurry up! Come with me. It is this face that has changed your destiny. Come to your senses, Bingo! - Or else... Keep out of this, madam. And you will come to your senses now, Sampat. Take a look at this. What conspiracy is this? It's your own doing! I've turned the tables on you. You sowed seeds of hatred in Rukmini's heart,.. ...by showing her this picture. You instigated her into going to the courts for a divorce. So Rukmini would inherit all of Rai Bahadur's wealth... ...after which, you would usurp all the moolah. But I won't let you swallow the whole lot all by yourself! I will show this picture of yours to Rukmini. And I will expose both of you! Bastard! You dare double-cross me! I won't let you live anymore! Don't play with guns, Sampat. You'll burn your fingers. But you still won't get your hands on any evidence. I've already handed over the negative.. ...and a recording of our conversation to a friend. He will take the evidence to the police in half an hour. This man has cheated us, Sampat! Not true, madam. I've merely struck a deal with you. Well, all right. Give me those negatives and the tapes... I'll give you 50,000 Rupees. Just 50,000? - Okay... 100,000. Madam. - 200,000. 300,000. All right. Make it 400,000. Half a million... and not a penny more! All right. We knew you'd blackmail us. So we've brought the money along. Now give us those tapes and the negatives... ...and you can have the money. Throw that gun away, Sampat. I can't trust you. You might shoot me... ...after you've got the tapes and the negatives. All right. My friend! Double-cross! Not at all. It's merely a ploy to get even with bastards like you. Every word you have uttered is recorded in this cassette. You are indeed a pair of lowly bastards! You have ruined three lives for the money. How could you forget? I'm famous... I break stones with glasses. I remember now... I slipper dogs like you! Scoundrel! No... out of my way, buddy. Let him go! Let him go! Brother! Brother! Bloody swine! Cur! Get up! Get up! You break glasses with stones, do you? Get out. Arrest them, Inspector. This picture is a fabrication! It's a conspiracy, sister! So you will give me my husband in charity, will you? No, sister... Shyam has always belonged to you. He always will. So you want to talk me into sharing Shyam with you? I must play his wife. And you'll be the mistress, isn't it? No! Please! For Shyam's sake! Don't think of such things! Ask your uncle. It was he who got me married to Gunwantlal. Insolent woman! You're accusing my uncle now! Why would my uncle want to have anything to do with girls like you? Now listen carefully... I'm not going to spare you! I'll have you dragged in the court, too! Your suspicion has landed you in court. But I beg of you! Do not bind your husband in chains. Do not destroy your own life! You have ruined my life. You have destroyed my happiness! And now, you're telling me what to do! I've always considered myself inferior to you, sister. What am I going to tell you? The only thing I regret is that you have misunderstood my worship. This house of yours, with Shyam and you, is like a temple to me. Why would any woman defile her own temple? Temple... worship... words not meant for your filthy mouth. Just remember... if Shyam does not belong to me, I'll see he does not belong to you! Get out of my house. Get out. I said get out. Rukmini. "I am your little sister." "I am your little sister."

"My prayers for a lac lives you be his bride." "I am your little sister, Don't take me for a co-wife." "Don't take me for a co-wife." "Shyam is yours an d will remain so." "Shyam is yours an d will remain so." "I am his disciple." "Don't take me for a co-wife." "Don't take me for a co-wife." Radha... what have you done? And why?! It's the right thing... Am I not lucky? I'm dying at your feet. I have completed my worship. No! No... Smile... and see me off. Laugh... and see me off. Laugh... please laugh. "Saying my last Good-bye." "Your favourite sister is going." "Don't keep any grudge in your heart." "I plead to you." "I plead to you." "My prayers for a lac lives." "You remain his bride." "Don't take me for a co-wife." "I am his disciple."
