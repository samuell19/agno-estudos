--== McEphie ==-- For latest releases visit moviesnipipay website LET'S GO TO ANTIPOLO STICKY RICE, MANGO, CASHEWS, ETC Older people say that while children are inside their mommy's tummy, their mommy should be talking to them and planning for them so that their destiny will be on the right track. Well, I did that, anyway. I said, "My child, I want you to be a better person. To be happy. To be wise and successful. That way you won't have any monetary problems, because you will be rich because of your diligence and strength." Nico! Stand up already. "And when you meet the one, he will love you. He will serve you and make you happy. And he will not hurt you. I want to see you getting married like a princess bride." But not everything a mom wants happens to her child. -Ouch! -Abby! Are you OK? Abipot! Stand up. My heel... Times change. Generations pass. -Likes and dislikes. -Stand up my child. My wish is for my only child to inherit my strength. She's Abby. Ma, I'm sure I'm the one who those boys at the reception were laughing at. There was one guy who was taking videos. Come to think of it, I am wearing Prada. Ma, I was bragging about this to my friends! Then what happened? My heel wore out! Ma, that was Prada! It was more expensive than the bride's shoes. It was good quality though. It was a Class A imitation. What imitation? You mean it was fake? Not original? You told me you bought it from your friend in New York. But she bought it in Greenhills. Abipot-pot, hold on. We have a flat tire. Abipot-pot, please help me. It's kind of heavy. Come here. Ma. You know what? I should have bought a better shoes than that. Ones that would not put me to shame. It's so annoying! I'm so pissed off! So what do you want to do now? Enter a time machine and go back to the time I asked you to wear the shoes? Then, you will refuse to wear them? Abipot-pot, it's not like it's a thing that's only ever happened to you. Come on, don't make a big issue of it. Ma, that's not my point! It's my first time joining a wedding entourage, and I was the maid of honor. It's so annoying! I wish I could have just bought a pair of shoes. It's hard. Come on. Ma, I'll do it. I'll help you out. Abipot, go inside! Hurry up! Please. You'll get wet, come on. Now go! Ma, let's go! We can't leave it here, I need to finish this! Don't mind me! -Bolay! -Ma'am? Bolay! Didn't I tell you to open all the curtains in the morning? I want all the curtains opened up so that good luck will come in. I don't want it dark in here, Bolay. Friend, we have a booking on Saturday. Are we accepting it? Are you sure it's Saturday? -It's last minute! -Hello, friend! -Hello friend, where are you? -Oh, sorry. Sorry I forgot. I'm doing something. Wait up, Saturday... Friend! It's already Thursday. Why did they just make the reservation now? Their child wanted to have her birthday at our restaurant while the father wanted to have an out of town trip to Palawan. Anyway, the child won. That's why the mom made the reservation just now. Friend, we don't want to lose 50 guests. Well? Are we doing this or not? Is it really Saturday? OK. We'll accept it. But I will create a menu for the children OK? Don't forget about my soap, so I can get married again! Soap? You're a tease! I already ordered it from the Korean guy. -Let me see. -Ma! Who the hell took this video and uploaded it here? Do you want me to get him mauled? What? Do you want me to do that? Look at your face. You look ugly. When your frowning, you don't look pretty anymore. Come on, just inhale and exhale. -Abipot-pot! -Ma! You told me to get over it. That's what I'm doing now! Let me see if you are really over it. -Hello! -Ma! Give it to me! -No! -Ma, I already threw that away. Why did you have to find it again? You threw it on the back seat of our car. -Ma... -No, it's souvenir. -It's your souvenir from Prada! -Give it to me. You really should move on from breaking it. So next time, we'll just buy shoes in Divisoria. -You know this is the heel of our nation. -Ma! But you know what, because of this heel, you had an end of the world moment. You're such a baby! Ma, give it to me. I am dead serious. No, I am serious. On your next birthday, I will gift you with original Prada shoes. Not from Greenhills, but originals. Not an imitation. You got it! Give it back to me! -Abipot give it back to me! -You didn't see it coming. Promise huh? Promise! Even two pairs of Prada shoes, I will buy for you. -Ma... -You're so heavy. Those are expensive. And... I don't think you can buy them. -Why? -Stop it! Is there anything more expensive than my love for you? Am I right? Ma, stop it! Ma, you're already sweating! -Am I sweating? -Yes you're already sweating. My armpit! This is our favorite. There, let's interview our customers. OK, I'll follow up on that. Come, let's go inside. Two monster ball spaghettis, where are they? -Here, this is for table four. -It's not! -I will get it! -Hurry up! Get it! This is Aleli, who doesn't believe in forever. There is no forever! That's only for romcom movies. Those cheesy things? There is no forever period! That's what bitter women always say! -Shut up! Monster ball spaghetti! -Here they are! Hey, everyone do your job! Because... -Hi, Auntie Nelia! -Is it recording? Bon appétit! Come! Let's eat! Sorry if I look haggard, we're so busy, it's peak hour. Are you going to post this? Yes, I am, Auntie! All right, my eyebrow is very important. Hopefully, this will be virus. Nelia! There you go again, Not virus, it's viral. It doesn't matter if it's virus or viral! I don't care! Budz, are you still in Mama Mina's? We're going to the gig later, OK? I'm still at my training, but my shift is going to be over very soon. I'll pick you up. All right, Nico, I'm just here at Mama Mina's. OK. Abby, you know what? We used to be just like you guys. You know, we would borrow money just to watch a Gary V concert. Let's show her some Gary V moves. Come on! This was when we were young. -Come on. -Wait. It's like this, one, two, three! Come one. One more time! And he was so handsome! -Come on... -All right, anyway. After that, don't go anywhere else. You have an interview. Nems, ask your son to bring my daughter home right after the gig. Come on, your daughter is more strict than you, hello. -Ma! Yes, I am OK. -Are you OK? -Bye, Auntie! -You take care! -Bye, Ma! -Take care, Abipot! Please serve this one. Actually, Abby and Nico look good together. Vivo! I think they're together, they're just keeping it from you. If ever they have a baby, I'm sure the baby's going to be so cute! -Here, get these. -Hey, Aleli? Even when they were very young, they were just good friends! So stop making up stories. -Hey, Nico! -Yes? -It's Zak! -Zak? It's Zak from the Zak Ford. -What? -You don't know him? Bro, fill it up. My God, he is so cute! Look at him, Nico. Is that what you call cute? He just has good style. And he's famous, so of course his fans think he's handsome. Me, even though I'm not famous. I am still handsome. -Oh, Xander Ford's leaving. -Nico! That's Zak Ford! Oh, you're right, that's right. Here, wear this. We might be late. It's always like this, it's so annoying. Budz, don't do it anymore. It's not like my head's going to fly away. Budz, you need to wear this so you'll be safe. This is not safe. I'm fine. Just wear it. We're always like this. I'm not a kid anymore, I'm already 21. You act like my dad! Why not just tie me up on your motorbike every time I ride it? Budz, I'm your daddy because you're my baby. Baby... clumsy. Oh, really? I am clumsy. I am clumsy? But you're still cute though. -Is that OK? -That's good enough for me. -You're great. You're awesome. -Let's go! Claire? Where's Abby? She's in the restroom. -Abby? -Huh? Yes! -She's in the restroom, we were together! -I was in the restroom. They're not there. Diwa, where's Abby? -Wait, my friends might be looking for me. -Wait up. Maybe later. Hey, are you OK? -You're drunk. -She doesn't want to stop drinking! Oh, bro, I'm Zak. Yes, I am Nico. I saw you before, you're good. Thank you! He was so good. He's so extraordinary. Abby, I think you are drunk. -We were just talking! -That's right! Aren't you done yet? Let's go home. Can I have a picture! -Bye! -Take care! Thank you, Budz, for bringing me there. You're the best! -What is it? -Nothing. Get off now, Budz. I don't want to. What do you mean? Let's go. I don't want to, can we go later... What? -Drink a lot of water so that... -I know... Budz! Are you listening to me? Drink a lot of water so that you'll be sober tomorrow morning. You still have an interview! Seriously, thank you. Where's my phone. Where's my phone! Where's my phone. -Oh... -Let me see... He's fast. What a player. -Let me see... -Here, take a look at it. Zak texted! Wait. Listen. He's so cute! -OK, Budz! OK. -Read it! Read it. You're so into him. Ma! Not that! Please. The smell's too strong! It smells like a car freshener! I'm sure you bought that in Greenhills, too. Wait. Why are your hands cold? -Are you nervous? My child, you can do it. -Ma... no. -Ma, I have to go. -Take care. OK. Just put one hand in your magic pocket. You will take all your courage from your magic pocket. You can do it. I believe in you. -Hello, Bud? -Budz. Are you still OK? That's just an interview, you're not going to a speech. -Just be cool. -This is my third time, Budz. What the... What the...? Where's my phone? Bolay. Why are all our clocks saying 6 o'clock, but this one's set to 4? Maybe the batteries are going flat. Get some new batteries. What for? I'll just fix this. Wait a minute. Here. And your favorite, orange juice. I baked you an apple pie. Ma, what's this for? We're celebrating your new job. You're already in training, right? I'm sure you're in, Abipot-pot. I didn't get into the ad agency. But you have been training for a month now. Because they have high expectations. They have high standards. I'm still jobless. Then whatever you learned from them, use it for other companies. This is already the third company I've tried to apply for. Nothing happens! I always flunk. It doesn't push through. Is it just bad luck? Or am I just dumb? Don't say that, Abipot-pot. You don't have to hurry. And you're good and bright. After one year from my graduation, I'm still like this. Nothing's changed. You don't have to work for other people. Take care of our business. Manage it. Improve Mama Mina's. Or maybe we can open a new branch in Manila. Maybe that's where you're meant to be. everything you put perseverance and hard work into is a career. What's wrong with working for our restaurant? Do you remember when you were a child? You always copied what I did. That's not what I want anymore. That's what you want. Why did I study and go to college just to work in a... boring restaurant like ours? That so-called "boring restaurant" you're referring to, was the one that got you to school and helped you finish it. It gives us life, my child. But what's that "something else" that you want? Is that what you really want? You know what your problem is, Potpot? You experience a few rejections and you give up right away. So this is kids nowadays... They get bored easily. They're always in a hurry. They look for challenges, but then they give up easily. I'm always here for you, my child. I'm just here. "I think I've texted you 10 times already. You never reply." I'll just put it here. Drink it while it's hot. Get dressed. We might be late to the embassy. Aunt Cora already called asking if we have tickets. So, that means we can't get denied. And it'll be our first time in the states. You'll finally get to experience your longtime dream of seeing snow in New York. Are you happy? Jeng, let's just fix it outside. Hurry. You're making me crazy! -Help me, it's so heavy. -Ms. Abby's here. I've missed-- Ms. Abby, how are you? Abby's here. She's here. Here's our bills. Electricity bills, water, seafood, all these... Auntie. How are you? You know what? Nico and I were going to visit you last Sunday. But then I thought you might not want to be disturbed. Are you OK? I'm OK. And you? Pretending... I've had our freezer cleaned and fixed. And I made Nico look for some ingredients for the raw materials. Do you want us to get help from Nico? He took up Culinary Arts anyway. Am I right? The problem is... what are we going to do if the US calls him for his training? Let's not disturb Nico. He has his own plans for his life. Back to business for Mama Mina's! Abby, where are you? I'm here at Mama Mina's. -Come here! Hurry! Just come here! -Why? Just hurry. We're here at Archie's with the girls. You should be here in 15 minutes, otherwise, you might miss the moment. You have to see this! OK. Fine. OK, I'll see you. Budz, how are you? Do you want to talk? I'm in a hurry. Sorry. -Why are you hurrying me? -Abby! Sit down! I'll show you. -Sit here. -Oh my God. -Here. -I wasn't late. What are you talking about? Do you see what I see? What's this drama about? Why did you have to call me? That's it. Girl, if your anger is still there, you will explode. No! Express it! Go! Give them a sample of it! I'll back you up! Express it! Go get him! There! He's gone! You should have expressed yourself! You're going to explode! Boom! If you guys thought I'd be dense enough to attack them, especially that two-timer Zak... I promise, you're my one and only. He broke up with you already, and you're still hoping? I don't understand... I don't understand why he cheated on me. I thought he was serious. You're my first. Blow it. Go on, blow again. You're wasting your tears. If a guy left you, that's only one time. A big time. And then, you move on. That's the same question I had when I was pregnant and your father left me for someone else. You own no one. They can only be taken or stolen from you. And when someone else has taken hold of them, they own them. Don't be a crybaby. That's enough. Drama queens are not in anymore. We intentionally came here because Cheska said that the food here was good. -Auntie! -Abby. How many customer did we have? Just 3 tables. Before, by this time, the restaurant was always full. I think my strategy is not enough. I think they still want your mother's recipes. -Auntie... -Yes? The customer complained. They say that the food has hair and the taste is off. They asked me if it was musty. Tell them that we will change their food. I already suggested that but they refused. Just give them a cake. Go, make an excuse. You know Abby, we're in an adjustment period... We're not here for the cake but for the pasta. I'm sorry, ma'am... The establishment is good but the food is not. We're still adjusting since your mama's gone. Don't worry, we can recover. We can change the menu if you want. We have many options, not just the pasta. Auntie, let's just close this restaurant. You know, Abby... your mother's dream was to make this restaurant grow. -That is what she wanted. -But... but if that is the case, how can we maintain the situation? How can we pay the rent? Afford the supplies? -What about the salary for the waitresses? -Abby, we can save this restaurant. I'm still studying your mother's recipes. I will get that in time. Just be patient. Auntie... my mother is gone, so the restaurant is gone too. This restaurant is useless, because there is no magic touch from her. Abby, please... Auntie. Our contract here will end this month. Let's just end it here. Please talk to the staff. I'm sorry. Abby, no. Abby, please. The fruit's delivery is just in time. I will make your favorite jam. From Mr. John again. I think our Korean supplier has a crush on me. Oh? Why are you looking at me like that, Abipot? I don't have a crush on Mr. Jang. My heart is locked. You know... it's enough to have one big heartbreak. Your dad is good at giving experience. Here, I will make jam for you. Just wait. Wow, I think I can make a lot of jam. Do you want to share it with your friends? It's so hard! My most important wish... is for my Potpot to be happy... and successful... And, of course, to have... Hey, that's true, because you know that we're hopeless romantics for a long time. Auntie, there is an exception here. There, she has a love life already! -When did it start? -Nico? You knew about it? -Ma, blow the candle already. -Yay, blow it! Abipot? Here? In here, really? I trusted you! Damn it! I trusted you! What else do you want? I thought that I raised you well. Respect me. Have respect for me. And most of all, have respect for yourself. Ma, you don't want me? You don't want me anymore? I can't understand you, Budz! Am I out of your life, Budz? Suddenly, we are not friends anymore? What, suddenly you don't want to talk to me anymore? I don't understand you, Budz. That's why I don't want to involve you. You're senseless. You're the one who put trouble in your life. I chose it, so let me deal with it. I don't need your help. You, you have your own issues. Solve and focus on them. What happened to us? What was us before... is now just an option, Nico. We're not in high school anymore. When you and your boyfriend broke up... I understand why you didn't talk to me. But this... When your mom died... You can share grief with me. I'm... What do you want? That I'll just tell you my stories and that's it? And you'll just listen? It can't be... And then what? You're going to calm me down? Because everyone left me. Including me? I'm right here. You will leave me, too. He broke up with you already, and you're still hoping? Stop hoping for that second chance. I know Zak and I are still together. I love him and I know that he loves me too. What? GRANDMA LOTI CALLING Hello, dear. I couldn't contact you. After your mom's burial, you never came to visit me. It's your mom's 40th day. We had a prayer offering. Uh, I'm sorry, Grandma. I can't visit you. You need to come here. I will wait for you. Your mom left something here. All right. You forgot your towel again. Do you have plans later? Let's go to the spa. It's been a while since our last spa bonding, you know. Let me do my beauty rituals. Abipot? Well? Can you go with me? Please. Let's go? Why, Grandma? Why didn't Mom tell me that... she was terminally sick? That... it was ovarian cancer? I miss her so much, Grandma. So much. My child. A parent doesn't bury their child. It's the other way around. I thought you were brave. Take care of Abby. Mama. I can't do this. Ma, I will borrow your brush. Are you OK? Mina? Mina, what you need is help. I will go to your house. Wait for me, my child. Mina? My child? One week after... your mom was buried... this package came. This is the reason I called you. How did you get this box? From a courier service. It's like your mom knew the exact date... of her death, because the letter that came with this... has her plans for you. She says... I need to give it to you before your birthday. I don't know... what is in the box, but... her only request is... you need to fulfill the five... Five letters? I don't know what's in the letters. But that is... that is the way your mom was. From when she was young... she did lots of things... that shocked me. She'll make you think. Your mother loves you so much. She loves you so much. She wants you to feel that, even though... even though she is gone... Even if she's gone. I'm not stalking you. I'm not saying that. You have a flat tire. I'll help you with that. Abby, come on. Even this, you haven't put this up yet. You might... get into an accident. What else do you need? What? I'm going to help you out, OK? I can do it myself. I can do it. I'll deal with the tire. -It's heavy. -I'll do it. Give it to me. What? You'll do it? -I'll do it. -No, I'll do it. Come on, I'll do it. You'll be the one to do it? -I'll do it. -OK. We'll do it. Together. No, we're not together. Just the tires. How does that work? Have you done this before? Mama always did that. She made it look so easy. Your mom was different. This is hard. -Especially when you are alone. -What about you? Why can you do it? Because you are here. Can you get... -Oh, you take this. -No! I'll get it. There. You look like the Virgin Mary. Wait, we're going to lift it. You need to... I didn't know this was so hard. Your blush looks great. Ouch! -Take me out. -OK. Just like we used to? Just like we used to. Hey! Don't be a cheater! -Eat up. -No, I'm OK. -Come on, you first. -No, you go first. OK, I'll go first. Open wide. Come on, eat up. It's delicious. The hotel in New York replied already, the one where I will study. In six months, they will arrange my papers. That's it? I'll be in a training, it's not like I'm already a souse-chef. At least you are doing great. You're already in. That's included in your master plan right? Even when we were in high school, you wanted to be a chef. Yes, but it's not the... the thing I wanted to hear from you. So what do you want to hear from me? I'll miss you? I don't want you to go? Yes, something like that. Slightly? Wouldn't I allow you to do it? I know you want to do it, don't I? Nico, your mom would like that, too. While me, my mom, she died, but... I didn't do anything or accomplish anything before she died. Something solid. Something that I will not back down from, whatever happens. I achieved nothing. Someone who always cried and didn't know what do with herself. I've had enough. I'm full. I still have to fix Mama's things. Let's go? Abby, do you still love Zak? What? -Well, I just wanted to know. -And why do you want to know? I know it's not about you and Zak. I wanted to ask because... is there any chance you'll get back together? I don't know. Maybe, because it's my fault. Because I thought... he was a thing that belonged to me. I was so attached to him. I guess you still love him. You're still affected. I'm afraid of failure. Sometimes, I'm easily disappointed... Are you like that, Ms. Eduque? -How's our sales? -They're OK. -Where's Auntie Nelia? -She's in the kitchen. Nico's helping her. Nico? He's our chef today. In fairness, the customers love his new recipe. What's that? -Nico! -Let me see. Budz? Is that you? You're just in time! Let me taste it. -Am I right? -Nico. Why are you taking over the kitchen without letting me know? No, I just asked him to help me today. But come and taste it, it's so delicious. -Come on, taste it. It's really good! -No, I don't want to. Auntie, why are you trying so hard? In a few days, this place will be closed down. Auntie, we've already talked about this. Remember, we already have plans? Nico, stop it. Plans? You don't have any plans. You are just waiting for this to close down. The business that me and your mom started. I won't allow it, just closing it down without a fight. Auntie, I'm just being practical. If Mama were alive, she would also close this down. If your mom were alive, none of this would happened. Your mom? She honored her word. She was resourceful. She made her own decisions in life and was selfless. And you? You haven't even tried to fight, but you've already given up. You know, your mom was right. You are so weak! You have not inherited even one part of her perseverance from her. Not one. Mama is Mama. And I'm me. Mama's still alive. Stop crying. Save it for my funeral. Save your tears. You'll look ugly, Abipot-pot. I'm not ready yet. Even me, I don't want to leave. Because I'm not ready yet. Because I know you are not ready yet, Abipot. But when it's time to go... I really need to go. Please don't. Abipot-pot, what I want is... When I am gone... You're already a strong person. That you can say to yourself... I don't want to. Enough of your crying. Even if Mama's gone, you're still alive. Mom, no. You're still going to get better. For the two of us. Promise me... you'll not be a crybaby anymore. Don't let problems pull you down. Just persevere in life. My Abipot-pot. Open these one by one. One week at a time, my child. When you go the stockroom in our basement, look for the small yellow box that says "Mama Mina's". Here, you will see the one thing that was very important to your life, and mine. Ma, I can't find the yellow box. Are you just making fun of me? Take care of it. Give it importance, as I did. Sometimes, you'll think it means nothing. But you'll find it important in time, and it can change a wrong decision. When you were still young, to make you stop crying, we cooked together. Spaghetti is your favorite, that you slurp while it's hanging in your mouth. Just like Grandma Loti said, you feel calm when you help me slice, mix, and taste. Remember the time that you made some big meatballs? Later on we called it the monster ball, because you couldn't finish it because it was too big. That was Mama Mina's signature pasta. When you get married, Abipot, your husband will surely love you more. And when you are cooking, you should... be dancing. Smile, be happy so that the energy will go into the food. They will never forget you when they experience good food. Your signature dish. The smile that they get from the happiness that came from your dish. Your magic touch. You'll be a mother someday. Your secret ingredient will be your husband and kids' topic of conversation every time you're at the dinner table together. All of your long days will end. Your family will get good vibes from the food you serve them. Look for the one that will let your heart pound. Remind yourself of the things that you were so eager to do when you were a child. The ones that will give you a smile in your everyday life. And when you find them, give them all your love and patience. For sure, you will never go wrong and it will come back to you doubled. This is a wealth that no one can steal from you. Cooking should be just right. You know why? It's just like a relationship. You should not be too strict with your partner. Because if you do that, you will lose him for sure. And in all aspects of life, remember... it should be just right. It should not be excessive... And not lacking. And my most important ingredient, Abipot-pot, is... love. Sauté onion and garlic. We need ingredients in our life, because that will spice up our relationships. Add the minced tomatoes. Add the tomato paste. Cook well to remove the sourness. If you sauté it too much, it will thicken. And if you sauté too little, it will be too dilute. So, it should be sautéed exactly right. Add in salt, pepper and Italian seasoning. And wait for it to cook. Drop in the monster meatballs. That is love. It's because that is the main ingredient. So much love and care. Cooking is just like love. You need to watch over it. And if you did not choose the right ingredients, all your sacrifices will be disregarded. Budz, it seems you're eating well? Mama left her phone here. What's that? -You like? -OK. Open wide. Budz, it tastes so good. You did this? You cooked this? Really now... You take after your mom. You know... all of Mama's original recipes are in this box. Yes, you inherited the box of recipes, but what will you do with them? You're closing down Mama Mina's. What if I decided not to close down Mama Mina's? Auntie Nelia's right. If Mama were still alive, she wouldn't close it down without giving it a good fight. Mama's magic touch is in this box. But the secret ingredient, is with me. Wait, I want to hear this. Take your seat. Tell me, what's the secret ingredient? As she always said, That's what they call the things that you are diligent about and persevere in. Sometimes you think that the things you wanted to do are the things that will make you whole. But what is more challenging to you is where you will really learn. -That's true. -That's right. So what are your plans? I'll try. It's been so long. Excuse me, sorry to bother you both. Is this a date thing? So, that's my contribution to Mama Mina's Pasta House. OK, let's see. -There too many people. -Hey, I will hand out flyers, OK? Friend, look at this. It's already trending on Facebook! It has over 100,000 shares. Thank you, guys, if not for you, this would not have happened. Abby, come on, this is nothing. Did you know that most of the paying customers of Mama Mina's -are mothers, fathers, aunties and uncles. -And also millennials. Come on! -Do you know who's here? -Who? Your ex with his new girlfriend. He's such a player. Hey, Abby! What are you going to do? I forgot to tell you something before you played me! Before both of you fooled me. -What? -What? Let's go! You're such a liar. Guys, do you know who your idol really is? He is a liar! That was really great! Paul, can you serve tables two and three please. We already have waiting customers! All our loyal customers came back! And! Somebody wants an interview with you. -Really? -Lasap magazine. Really now. So, babe, are you excited? The food here tastes great! Here's your take-out. Come again! Auntie! We are already on 20k! Good job! Oh my God. Is Abby here? She's inside. -What are you doing here? -Can we talk? -Please don't. -It's either you will go with me... I will wait for you until you close the restaurant. I know it, even if I need to say sorry a million times. Even if you say sorry a million times... Zak, that has no meaning to me anymore. Babe, you know my groupies. About Yanni? this will open up a thing that you still don't know, and I ought not to let you know. I wanted to prepare you, so you would understand. It's a part of my dream that I can no longer pursue. I ran out of time. What I want is for you to continue my dream. This is not for me, Abipot. It's for you. They said this used to be a Chinese restaurant. It went bankrupt. I don't know why Mama bought this. A lot of money would be needed to fix this. But, Budz... your mom already started with it. And you don't know, this really might be her dream to expand Mama Mina's. But... this is a commitment, Budz. A big responsibility. The restaurant in Antipolo is just picking up. This is another thing to take care of. If I go through with this, it might be hard for me to pay off all of Mama's debt. And look at the place. It's so weird. What if it doesn't work? Or can't be sustained? I can't. Your mom wouldn't have given this to you if she thought you couldn't do it. Please believe in yourself. Abby, I... I believe in you. And you are not alone. I will be with you all the way. Until you reach the pinnacle of success. Budz, let's go. Let's go. Wait... Budz. What is it? Your shoelace. Why didn't we ever have a date? Why? Did you ever ask me? All right. -Hey! -What's your problem? Abby, come out of here! -Zak, what is it? -Let's go! Zak, stop it! You're drunk! -Come with me! -Zak! Stop it! -Come on, let's go! -Get off of me! -Stop it! -Hey! What's that? -Don't you dare intervene! -Stop it! -Go home! -Nico, let's go! -Get inside, please! -Zak, go home! -Hey! Wait up! -Get inside! Do you like Abby? You don't look good together. What rock star are you? Go home! Get inside Abby. -Zak, go home! -Get inside, please get in! Thank you because... again, you are my hero. What? -Are you serious? -Yes! Budz, I promised your mom way, way back... that whatever happened, He is your dad. Photocopy your birth certificate and take care of it. My father's name isn't in there, and I was born without one. How will I photocopy that? You have a father. You can see him. Haven't you been my "ma-da" since birth? My mama and dada, that's enough for me. No matter what, he is your dad. And there will come a time that you will meet. When you are ready. Miss, can I help you? I'm looking for someone. -Do you happen to know Mario Villamin? -Oh, he's the architect. Can you please call the architect. I'll go ahead, please wait for him. When will this be finished? -Excuse me, boss. -Yes? -Boss, a girl is looking for you. -Why? -Who did she say she was? -There she is. -OK, we're done. Fix that, huh. -OK, sir. Every child has the right to know their father. And every father has the right to know their child. Are you Mario Villamin? Yes, I am. -I am Abby. -Why? Daughter of... Mina Eduque. You know I hurt your mom when we separated. I didn't have a chance to ask for forgiveness. You know... she brought you up so well. I think you're a really good daughter. I am thankful because, even though your mom's already gone, we still saw each other. I didn't even think that we could still see each other. Because I already forgot about you a long time ago. I have to admit, I am mad at you. But... the reason why I am here is, I want mama to be at peace. Abby, my child. Can you forgive me? Mama has already forgiven you. That is why I am here in front of you. And because I am my mama's daughter, I will also do so. Now that I've seen you, all my questions have been answered. I'm sorry, my child. -Ah, Dad! -Hey! The foreman is looking for you. Bryan, this is Abby. -Abby, this is Bryan. -Hi! OK, let him know I will be there in a while. Abby. Are we still going to see each other? I know that your taste buds are good. So, the game is, you need to guess what the key ingredient is. Just one. That one, what is that? Yes, can I take this off? I'll show you something, take a seat. Oh, it's my turn. All right, what is it? Do you want me blindfolded, too? -No need, just cover your eyes. -All right. -You're going to push through with it? -Yeah. We are going to open our second branch. This is not about me, this about your Grandma Loti. She's wanted to do this for years, but I was the one holding her back from doing so. Who is Nenita Mangtaw? I love your Grandma very much. Like you and me, we lived our lives alone, just the two of us, since your grandfather died. I haven't brought her here since you came into my life. Your grandma is already weak. I wanted to grant her that simple wish, even though I am gone because I know it will give her peace of mind. Hello? Anybody here? Are you Nenita Mangtaw? Yes, I am. Give respect to your Grandma Nenita. What are you doing here? You are the last person I want to see! Grandma! Me and Grandma traveled so far. She only wants to talk to you. Please forgive me. I know that what I did to you and your children is unforgivable. With Peping. And I've felt sorry for that for so long. Please forgive me. Before I die, I wanted to beg for your forgiveness. I know you have all the rights with Peping, because... you are the real wife. And I took your rights away from you. I regret everything, sister. Please forgive me. Peping is dead. That's what I wanted to hear. You, asking for forgiveness. For all the time you denied my children the chance to be with their father. Sister... Thank you. My child, I know when we give your grandmother her wish, she will be at peace. As well as me. Have a taste of this, both of us made it. Wait a minute, it seems... There is no fish in here. Look at his hands, friend! And why are there two persons in one chair? You're right! What is that high chair? -Sorry, guys. -Wait up! -We fit perfect here anyway. -What's up with you guys? What's with the sudden change? What's that? I am Team Nico and I am so happy for you. I know you're perfect together. -What is that? -Oh my gosh. Wait. Yes, we're together. That's great. I know that Abby's heart is so happy! Because of that, group hug! Congrats, Abby! Just like we talked about, you will wear those authentic Prada shoes on your birthday. These are not a Class A imitation, huh? I want you to wear these on your birthday so that you won't have broken heels again. Do you think I look fine being Chef Mina! Wait, OK? This is how I always wanted to remember you. Full of life. Ma, you were my first teacher. First touch, first hug. My first bite of food. My first word. My first playmate. My first cook. Everything I am today is because of you. You taught me how to fear and to be strong. To be disappointed and to trust. To laugh so loud and to cry like a baby. To be praised and to be scolded. To be hungry and to be full. To be pushed and be hugged. To be loved and to be hurt. To die and to live again. Ma, you are my life. Now, I will do everything you want me to do. -Ma! -This is so great! I just got accepted! So, you'll be flying to the US? But I can be stopped from doing so... if it's you. Nico... it's your longtime dream. I will not tell you not to do that. Even if... we'll be separated for a long time? As Mama said when she was still alive, in relationships, there should be more you... than me. She told me, if we're meant to be... we really are. Anyway, this is for us. -What? -This is for you! -It's for us. -It's for you! I said, it's for us. It's for us. Ouch! Nico, hey! It's been a long way for me. I wanted to give up so many times because there were so many who didn't trust me. Who would have thought that I would find the one who can make my heart pound? I know who I really am. If not for you, Ma, I wouldn't have been able to go through with this. Till the end, you are still looking after me. Every time I cook, I relive the happy times when we were together. Hopefully, I won't disappoint you. I'm not scared anymore of the things to come. I knew that one day you would find yourself. Finally, you've done so. I know that you were the one who guided me. Remember, I told you... I won't ever leave you. I promised you that. Yes, maybe I'm gone in this world. But here, I will stay alive. She's wearing her Prada shoes from her mama! And because it's her birthday, she is wearing them! Look at your cake! I told you I was coming. Times change. Generations change. Likes and dislikes. A fighter who backs down to nothing. -Right. -Move closer together! I'll join you.
