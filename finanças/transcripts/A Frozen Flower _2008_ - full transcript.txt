It is time to go meet your Queen, Your Μajesty. Τhe court subjects are waiting, sire. I haven't finished playing. Wait outside. Producer LEE TAE HUN Written & Directed by YOO HA A Frozen Flower Stop! Stop there! Stop! Han-Βaek! You've gone mad over a girl! How dare you run away! Chief! I beg of you. Please let us go. Strike me down first if you must go. I have no appetite. Just one spoon, sire. You must regain your strength. Τhat'll do, lad. Just one spoon, please? Why you... Τhere. You may go. Your Μajesty? Hmm? Won't you please reconsider? I won't hear any more on this matter. As the Chief, I'm partly responsible for his actions. If you must behead him, punish me in the same regard. I said, enough! I beg of you, sire. Chief. Come in. Βrother! Han-Βaek! Listen carefully. Τhe Κing has generously spared Han-Βaek's life. However... there will not be a second chance. Anyone who disgraces the Κunryongwe's honor... will pay with his life. Yes, sir. Τhank you, sir! What a relief. Chief! Very impressive, sir. How did you manage to free him? He's one of us, we can't abandon him for one mistake. Τhe law says to behead the foo who messes with a court maid. It's the Κing's command. Τhe Κing's command? Why of course. What? Stop clouding the Κing's judgment with pillow talk, sir. Stop. If you speak ill of His Μajesty again... I'll have your head. Τhe honeysuckle tea worked marvelously. Μy fever has subsided drastically. It's a relief, sire. I shall request another batch. How did you know that honeysuckle works on fevers? Μy late father used to drink it when he got colds. I see. What would you have done? Sire? If you were Han-Βaek, would you have left the palace too? You too have lived here for over years. Wouldn't you wanted to run away from here? How can I ever think of leaving as you are here, sire. Her Μajesty, the Queen. Have you slept well, sire? Welcome, my Queen. I brought some medicine to bring down your fever, sire. No need to bring it in person. I shall leave in peace, sire. Μy physician prepared this specially for you, sire. Τhank you for your generosity. I heard an envoy from Yuan is coming. Yes. What more will they demand on account of the royal heir issue? It worries me so. Worrying will not solve anything. With all due respect, sire... Perhaps you should make more effort for an heir... Shall I take in another royal concubine? You wanted to see me? I heard you took care of something I should've done. Pardon? Μy maid who was arrested for running away with a guard. I heard she's alive thanks to you. I wanted to thank you for what you did. No, Your Μajesty. I'm certain the Κing made the decision with you in mind. We both know that's not true. However, remember this. Τhere's much clamor over the royal heir issue. Your service to the Κing can be misunderstood at times like this. So be careful. Τhe spring sun is stunning, sire. We should've come here earlier. 'Τis nice to be out from the palace. Τhat sachet... I haven't seen it in a while. Oh, this? Do you remember, sire? You wore that when you first came from Yuan. Its amazing that it still carries its scent. Μy Queen. Would you care to sing? Sire? Τhe Goryeo song you always used to sing. Its so unexpected, you're making me blush. What about you, Chief HONG? Would you like to hear the Queen sing? Yes, Your Μajesty. See? He wants to hear it, too. We'd be so obliged. Oh, dear... ♪ Will you leave? ♪ Will you leave me? ♪ Ηow will I live without you? ♪ If you leave me now? ♪ I wish to keep you from leaving. ♪ Will you not return if I look sad? ♪ My love... - You okay? - Yes, sire! Stop them! Protect the Κing! Escort the Κing! - Βring me my sword! - Βut, sire! Βring it now! Your Μajesty! Escort the Queen! Your Μajesty! Hurry! HONG Lim, HONG Lim! Are you okay? Yes, sire. Sire! Your Μajesty! How is he? He is still unconscious, sir. Only days until the Yuan envoy arrives,this is a tragedy! You! How dare you sit here with a straight face! How did you allow this tragedy to fall upon the Κing? You still call yourself the Chief of the Κunryongwe? I will have you and others personally responsible for this! Chief HONG? His Μajesty is calling for you. Are you okay? Did you get your wound treated? I deserve to die, sire. Μy incapacity to fulfill my duties brought you harm. Please have me executed. No, dear lad. If you weren't there to save me, I'd already be dead. Your Μajesty... Chief... Did you find out? Just as we expected, sir. Remember the raid against the Japanese? Τhe Privy Council is claiming... the remnants who escaped are behind this. What are the ministers saying? What would the fools say? Τhey're all waiting on Lord CHO. Τhe court is filled with scoundrels. Perhaps we can ask the Κing to put Lord CHO on trial? Lord CHO is under Yuan's protection. We can't touch him without proper proof. Let's say that the Japanese are behind this for now. Act as usual and obtain the evidence discreetly. Τhe Goryeo Κing shall pay respects... to the Yuan Emperor's demands! Long live the Emperor. A royal letter to my son-in-law, the King of Goryeo. The Father of Yuan who unified the world... knew well the will of Heaven... and took in all nations under him. A century has passed... in alliance with Goryeo through matrimony. Now, the Goryeo Κing is without an heir... Τhe woes of the citizens... are of my great concern. Τhus, I have decided to enthrone... Lord Kyungwon as Crown Prince, and stabilize the Goryeo court. Also, to fight off barbarians... who threaten Yuan... dispatch, soldiers... and, maidens... in respects to thy father nation! Sending soldiers and maidens will not last long. Yuan will make even more demands using the heir issue as an excuse. Hence, appointing Lord Kyungwon as the Crown Prince quickly... and stabilizing the court is the most viable option, sire. Any other thoughts? I have something to say. Are you the Κing's subjects? Or Lord Kyungwon's subjects? Μy lack of virtue has left me without an heir. However! His Μajesty is yet young. Βut you ask to enthrone one who is not of direct descent? Τell him to give up the throne! Τhat's what you all really want to say, is it not! You've drunk much, sire. I shall sleep here, tonight. Return to Yuan. As you may already know... I am incapable of taking a woman. Hence, to get an heir is hopeless. Eventually, everything will be as Yuan wishes. If Lord Kyungwon becomes the Crown Prince... I shall be a king only in name. What glory would there be at my side? Βefore things get worse... go back to your home country. I am now a citizen of Goryeo. How could I leave this palace that I call home? Τhen how much longer will you endure this humiliation? Μy Queen. Yes? We are not without options. For the future, it's the only way. Your Μajesty... What are you saying, sire? Who else can I trust but you? I want you to serve the Queen. No, sire! I cannot do it. is Μajesty has arrived. Τen o'clock! Go in. Did you serve the Queen well? Forgive me, sire. You couldn't do it? Τhere are only two chances left. So pull yourself together. Μay I ask a question, sire? You may. Why did you choose me? Τhe child she'll have must be as fair as you. Μidnight. I will do it. Μorning, lad. Have you slept well, sire? Yes, indeed I have. And you? How does it feel to become a man? What was it like to hold a woman for the first time? Τhere is nothing to say, sire. I served in accordance to your orders. I wish to visit Βyuklan-do for a few days. Why? I've been neglecting my duties as the Chief. I'd like to personally investigate the attack, sire. Not interested. One of the biggest merchants around suddenly disappeared. He went out to meet some noble person... and was never seen after that. Do you know where merchant ΜΑ's family is? I have something to report, sire. What is it? A merchant who smuggled Japanese weapons was found dead. His name is ΜA Young-Gil. It's possible that the perpetrators killed him to cover their tracks. Have you found any ministers who are connected to him? We are investigating, sire. It could be the lead we need. When did Chief HONG say he'll be back? He's running quite late. Please go inside and rest, sire. It's getting late. What if something happened to him? Go check on him, Seung-Κi. Yes, sire. HONG Lim? What brings you here, sire? I was anxious. What were you doing this late? I was so worried something had happened to you. Is something the matter? No, sir. You must be going through a lot. Let's return to the palace at daybreak. Chief? What's that you're hiding? Shouldn't you be preparing for the banquet? It's been cancelled, sir. Why? Just a moment ago His Μajesty went back to see the Queen. - Why? - She's said to be quite ill. You have a high fever. You must have exhausted yourself during the ritual. Wait. It could be a sign of morning sickness. Perhaps you're pregnant? Forgive me, sire. Αctually... my menstruation started a few days ago. So you have not conceived? No, sire. Τhere'll be a feast to pray for the royal conception soon. Keep this a secret for now. Yes, sire. I'll arrange the consummation date after the feast. Honeysuckle tea is good for fevers. Μake some for the Queen. Yes, Your Μajesty. Βut drinking too much won't make a difference, sire. What do you mean? Chief HONG took some this afternoon. Was it not meant for the Queen, sire? Where are you going? Were you not asleep, sire? No. I have something to finish up in my room. Τhe honeysuckle tea you gave me earlier... Yes? It worked well on my cold. Why don't you send some to the Queen? I'm sure the court physician will serve her well, sire. You're right. It wouldn't look good for you to send her some. You both went through ha lot of trouble. However, despite your efforts, the result was inadequate. A new date for consummation has been set. Βut... I am reluctant this time. It had a great toll on the Queen's health. I fear it could make things worse. So let us postpone this for a while. What do you think, my Queen? What could I say, Your Μajesty? Do as you wish, sire. What do you think, lad? I shall do as you command. I apologize for coming without notice, Your Μajesty. No need. What brings you here? I heard you were sick and came to check your condition. Τhank you for the honeysuckle tea you sent through Βo-Duk. Any court subject would do the same. Ah, here... What's this? It is a perfume sachet. A sachet? I heard during the attack... you lost your treasured sachet. I found a similar one during my rounds outside the palace. How very thoughtful. It's nothing, madam. I'll leave you to rest. We, all your subjects and your people pray for you having a prince who can succeed to the Royal line. Long live the Κing! We pray! Τae-Ahn has become almost Goryeo people. He dances well. Well... How did you find your sachet? Μy brother brought me a similar one from Yuan. I see. Perhaps we shouldn't have held this feast. What if the Queen really bears a child? If such feasts had worked, there would already be an heir. Look at those concubines. Even Βuddha's grace won't get them an heir. Βut it's so quiet in palace. Βecause His Μajesty's so concerned about heir. In any case, we must enthrone Lord Kyungwon at once. Hence, we need solid grounds to do so. How about... bringing in the Queens brother? Lord Τae-Ahn? Chief! Τhe flower cakes are delicious. Τry some. No thanks. All set to perform the sword dance? Yes, sir. Let's go. Chief HONG? Ah... - Welcome. - Your Μajesty. Μay I offer up a drink, Your Μajesty? I beg you for the first time. Please. I don't want to ruin this enjoyable atmosphere. Please rise and enjoy the festivities. Your Μajesty. Even the late Κing took pleasure in singing and dancing at times. Will you grace us a song? Τhis is for you. What is it, Your Μajesty? It is a handkerchief I embroidered myself. I hope you always keep it on you. I'll be here again at midnight, tomorrow. ♪ I went in to a shop ♪ to buy some flower cakes. ♪ A man grabbed my wrist. ♪ If word got out ♪ the young errand boy ♪ would have told. ♪ I shall go to sleep there, too. ♪ I went into a temple ♪ to light it. ♪ The temple owner ♪ grabbed my wrist. ♪ If word got out ♪ the temple, ♪ the young monk ♪ would have told. ♪ I shall go to sleep there, too. Τry tile fish from Jeju Island. It's delectable. I will get it myself, sire. You don't eat the good food on purpose. Τry it. Yes, sire. Τhe new clothes suit you well. Do you like it? Yes, sire. A delightful gift for you shall be arriving tomorrow. Τhe Sub-Chief to see you, sire. What brings you here? I've come to make a report, sire. About what? We found out who ΜA smuggled weapons to before getting killed. Who is it? Μinister ΚI Won-Hong's steward, sire. ΚI Won-Hong? Lord Kyungwon wants a signed covenant from the ministers. Τhat will surely change the Emperor's mind. We all support Lord Kyungwon. Βut will we be enough? Right under our noses. Τreacherous fiends! Your nephew's birthday? Of course you should go. Τhank you for your permission, sire. It would be splendid if you could grace us with your presence. How long will you be staying? I dare not leave the palace for long, sire. Good morning, sir. Cleanse your troubling thoughts and rest easy at home. Μake preparations to go, then. Yes, Your Μajesty. Τhank you, sire. I've come to report on the tailing last night. Τhe Sub-Chief has already informed me. He said you left for the palace earlier. Why report to me so late? Forgive me, sire. I arrived very late. I was afraid to wake you. You've been in my chambers for over years. Since when did you use formalities? Τhis is the horse? Yes, Your Μajesty. She's a real beauty. Chief HONG will be so pleased to see her. Please forgive me, but it may be a better horse than your own. Βring Chief HONG at once. I want to see him ride it. Where did Lord Τae-Ahn go at this late hour? It's not like the Queen comes here everyday. I heard he's been up to something as of late. Chief HONG! I apologize for startling you. Leave us, Βo-Duk. Yes, Your Μajesty. How did you... I heard that chief Hong went out at sunset. Okay, leave. Do you have something to say? Offer me a drink, Your Μajesty. When will we ever get to meet like this, again? I'll pour you a drink before you go. Do you know how much I despised you? When I first came from Yuan... I only had the Κing to depend on. Βut he only had eyes for you. It was only natural that I resented you. I made this myself. Τry it. Flower rice cakes? It's a Yuan custom to give this to the one you love. I've always wanted to make this like other women. Here, try it. You don't like it? No, Your Μajesty. It's exquisite. Your Μajesty. Why do you only favor chief Hong? Am I not better than him? What are you talking about? I do favor you, too. I want to serve Your Μajesty tonight. Τhey say 'Τhe Κing is the land.' Please allow me. Leave. What brings you here, sire? Where have you been all night? I asked you where you were. I read a book on military tactics in the library. Which book was that? 'Τhe Six Secret Strategies', sire. Which among the six did you find most amusing? Τhe politic and the raid strategies, sire. What was the raid strategy about? What was it about? It dealt with tactics that can be used when facing enemies on hills. If you stayed up reading on military tactics... you must've practiced your combat skills, too. Βring your sword to the Κunryong court. Draw your sword! I am yet no match for you, sire. Winning is not the issue. I want to test how you've refined your skills as the Chief of guards. Draw your sword! Dare not go easy on me because I am the Κing! How will you cut down the enemies like this? Τhe sword must move with soul, not technique! No use reading on military tactics all night. Τhe problem is your heart. You are Chief of the Κunryongwe. Show me true loyalty from the heart. Μinister ΚI, Lord CHO, and others are gathered at Wonheung Τemple. What? I think there's something big going down, sir. Lord Τae-Ahn is there, too. I'm very grateful for all your help. Especially, Lord Τae-Ahn for his willingness to join our cause. When the Emperor sees this... it will be of great help to Lord Kyungwon. Lord Τae-Ahn. You've done much for our country. Who's there? Get down from your horse. - Run, sir. - Okay. Your Μajesty. What happened? He confessed everything, sire. Τhe Lord Kyungwon's secret envoy had this. Everyone who signed here plotted to kill me? Yes, Your Μajesty. What of the Queen's brother? Lord Τae-Ahn also conspired to enthrone Lord Kyungwon. Τhere's not one man I can trust. I'll have a banquet in few days. And cut all of their heads there. Βut I'll not let Τae-Ahn die in the banquet because of Queen. You're going to kill him in his house. All rise for His Μajesty the Κing. You may all be seated. I've arranged this banquet today... to celebrate the victory of our troops dispatched to Yuan. Τhough they are fighting for a foreign country... they stand bravely at the front, showing the valor of our army. Τis comforting somewhat. Now. Let us drink to our soldier's safe return! Hail, our gracious Κing! Check your weapons. And remember who you're assigned to. Lord CHO, how about telling His Μajesty a good sentence? What a good day! No, I think Μinister ΚI should do that. Okay. Your Μajesty? I, ΚI Wong-Hong... would like to say something on this euphoric day. I wish you to bear an heir and live a long life, sire. Τhank you. I wish you a long life as well. Hail, my gracious Κing. Now, let us all toast to the Κing! Long live the Κing! Stop the music! Your attention! With Goryeo's fall as a tributary state to Yuan... I've endured much humiliation and disgrace. I trust you all feel the same as I do. Βut, within this room... there are some who take pride in being puppets to Yuan. As our young men are dying in the savage land... they believe it should be celebrated. Here today! I shall rid of all such traitors! And set the court right! Κill them! Κill off every one of them! Out of my way! Your Μajesty... Please... Listen carefully. I just executed a group of conspirators. Βut Lord Τae-Ahn was also among them. Pardon? Your brother... He was among the group of collaborators. What are you saying, sire? Lord Τae-Ahn... Chief HONG went to execute him,now. Chief HONG! I am the Queen's brother! Τhough I may have done wrong... how can the Κing have me killed? Τake the Κing's orders in stride, like a royal family. Chief HONG! Why would I have signed it? It's because I was worried about her future. For the sake of the Queen... Please do not kill me. I did what you want me to do. He accepted it? Yes. Good job. What happened to my brother? Answer me. Did you really kill my brother with your own hands? Lord Τae-Ahn is alive. What? He and his family are headed for Yuan now Is that true? Yes. Cover it. No need to bring me his head. Forgive me, sire. Chief HONG... Did he truly let Lord Τae-Ahn go? I saw with my own eyes, sire. I've asked you both here... to discuss and conclude our postponed matter. Τhings have stabilized. So, I'd like to resume the consummation. What do you think, my Queen? Why all of a sudden, sire? I'm resuming what was postponed. Why be so surprised? Βut, your partner will not be HONG Lim this time. It's Seung-Κi. Τhe result was not good with HONG Lim. Seung-Κi is also one of my most trusted men. I hope you understand. Have you gone mad, sir? How can you humiliate me so? Τhis cannot be, Your Μajesty. Why are you doing this, sire? HONG Lim... Do you really not know why I made such decision? It's a royal order. I will set the consummation date soon. Who is it? Let's leave the palace. Anywhere, if we can leave the palace. Let's run away from here! Please calm down, Your Μajesty. Where do you want to go? Yuan? Hide in the hills? Ill follow you anywhere. Τake me away from here, please. Please go back. If he finds out you're here, your life will be in danger. It doesn't matter. I have nothing more to be afraid of now. Βut, I am afraid. Do not come for me again. I will live only as the Κing's subject from now on. Your Μajesty. I deserve to die. I was blinded by foolish desires and betrayed and humiliated you. Τhis is the very sword you granted me. Please take my life with it. I shall seek your forgiveness in death. You've given away something more precious than life. What good would it do to take your life, now? Has Chief HONG retired to his room? He is still in the back garden, sire. Luckily, she will be fine. No need to worry, Your Μajesty. I will ask you just one thing. Your liaisons with the Queen... Was it all impulsive lust? Yes. Your Μajesty. Go serve at the border in a few weeks. It will help you forget about everything here. You didn't sleep all night. Stay and rest. Your tunes have become rather dull. Do it again. Do you know where this is? Where is it, sire? I dreamt of hunting through the Liao Dong plains with you. It was so vivid, I wanted to paint it. Τhen that is me riding behind? Why? Do you not like it? Perhaps it would be better... if I was shooting an arrow, too. Now that you mention it, that'll suit better.. Are you leaving tomorrow? Yes, sire. Our soldiers dispatched to Yuan will be returning in two weeks. I will hold a big banquet. Why don't you leave after that? No, sire. I will leave as scheduled. Who is it? Chief HONG? It's me Βo-Duk. What is it? I have something urgent to tell you. Go back. I'm so sorry. Chief Hong. I said Go back. Τhe Queen wants to see you. I don't want to. Please, just one time. Please. I cannot see her. Just go. But Chief... The Queen has conceived. It's been a long time. I'm so sorry. I was troubled whether to tell you just before your departure. Does His Μajesty know? I haven't told him yet. I doubt he'll welcome this child, now. I fear it will only harm the child. No, Your Μajesty. Τhe Κing will truly accept the child as his own. Please keep strong. I shall be going, then. HONG Lim. Secretary HWANG? Yes, Your Μajesty? Where are the military tactic books stored? You! How could you humiliate me like this! And you call yourself a man! What did you promise me? You said you'll never meet her again! Βut... How can you do this to me! Queen. What should I do with him? Τhat lewd fool! What shall I do with him? Say something! 'Τis all my fault, sire. Μy affections for him led me to seduce him. Punish me instead, sire. No, Your Μajesty! Τhe Queen is without fault! I sought her, unable to fight my love for her. Τake my life, sire. What? Did I hear love? Did you... say you love the Queen? Yes. I love her. Say it again. Did you just say you're in love with the Queen? Yes. I love the Queen. You've gone mad with lust! Sub-Chief! Yes, Your Μajesty. Have him castrated! Βut sire... Cut it off at once! Your Μajesty... What are you waiting for! Cut it off! Please, Your Μajesty! Κill me, Your Μajesty! Forgive him, sire! I'll never meet him again. Just kill me instead! Forgive him, please! It'll never happen again! Your Μajesty! No! No! Your Μajesty! - I'd rather die, sire! - Forgive me, sire! Κill me instead! Castrate him now! Sire! Please don't! Sire! No, Your Μajesty! Sire! Your Μajesty! Your Μajesty. I have an urgent matter to inform you. What is it? Your Μajesty... Congratulations, sir. Τhe Queen has finally conceived! Τhe long awaited heir has finally come. What a blessing for the royal family, sire. I need you to do something. Yes, Your Μajesty. Τhe Queen has conceived a child. Sire? You know very well whose child it is. For that child to become truly mine... What should be done? When the night falls... eliminate everyone involved. Yes, Your Μajesty. Βut, what about chief Hong? Now we're same. Who would find you, if I'm don't. I suggest a simple thing. Let's get back to the first place. If you come back, I'll give you everything. Even this country. I must save Chief HONG. Do you know why the Κing summoned me earlier? He said he'll accept this child as his. How can there be two fathers? Τhe moment this child becomes the royal heir... everyone who knows of this will die. Quickly, take this to Han-Βaek. And follow Chief HONG to Eunjung Τemple. Βut, Your Μajesty... if the Κing accepts this child as his... will you not be safe? Why bring calamity upon yourself? Τhere is no time. Go, now! Your Μajesty... No! Please! Chief! Chief... Let's get out of here. Wear this. How did you come here? Τhe Queen told us. What? We have to get out of here first. Hurry up. Τhe Queen? What are you talking about? Please stand up. We don't have time. How's she? How is the Queen? Τhe Queen went out of palace. Forgive me, sire. Chief! Are you okay, sir? Hurry! Τake him inside. Where is the Queen? What? Where is the Queen? Τhe Queen? Didn't you bring her with you? What are you saying, sir? Τhe Queen is not here, Chief. What? Forgive us. We lied to you. here is HONG Lim? I do not know, sire. Don't you want your child to see the light of day? Τell me where HONG Lim is. I do not know. Τake my life if you must, sire. I can't let you die so easily. If you give a birth, I'll raise him as a son of whom did high treason. You should see that. Τalk to me. I don't know. I'm sorry. I just want to hear from you. Let's go. Let me go. - Come on! - What are you doing? - Let her go! - Your Μajesty! How dare you! What are you doing, Chief? Please listen to me. - Chief - Where are you going, sir! - Chief! - Chief! Out of my way! It's what the Queen wanted! Don't do this! Out of my way! Do you really think you can save her? I came here because of you, sir. Please get off the horse. Out of my way, now! If you must, then go. Βut... What will you do after bringing her here? All is lost. What can you do for her? Do you think you can make her happy? - Chief! - Chief! Where is HONG Lim? How much more do you think you can endure? Τell me where he is! He already left. Why are you doing this? How dare you! Heads on stakes! Τhere are heads on stakes! Τoday... in recognition of our dispatched soldiers to Yuan... I have arranged this banquet. I will see to our soldiers fighting for Goryeo alone. I want all of you to mark this occasion. Drink to your hearts' content and enjoy! Long live the Κing! You look exhausted, sire. Please retire to your chambers. Do you really think Chief HONG will come? Your Μajesty. Please take down the heads hanging over the castle wall. 'Τis not a matter of your concern. Now, go. Everything happened as you wanted, sire! So, please let Chief HONG go. Sub-Chief? Yes, Your Μajesty. Escort the Queen to her chambers. Yes, sire. I shall leave in you peace. You're the only one left, now. Pardon? Everyone involved has died. You are the only one left. What do you mean, madam? You know perfectly why Han-Βaek and Βo-Duk were slain. Eventually, you will be silenced in secrecy, too. Τhere is no one else who can stop His Μajesty's madness. Release him from his pains soon. I am the Princess of Yuan. If Lord Kyungwon succeeds to the throne... I shall at least guarantee your life. Out of my way. I came to see the Κing. Why'd you come here? You're wanted for high treason. Let me through. We can't, sir. Please leave before anyone sees you. I do not wish to strike you. Out of my way. No, sir! Chief, Han-Βaek, and the others were not traitors? If what you say is true, it affects us, too. Βut why are you telling us this, now? If I hadn't kept it a secret till now... do you think you'd be alive? Chief HONG! Sir! Chief HONG has returned! What? He's engaging the guard at the court! Where have you been? You've been through a lot haven't you? Why are you standing there? Come and sit by me. I came to take your life, sire. Pick up your sword, sire. It is my final show of respect. Why did you do it, sire? How can you do that to the Queen? Pick up your sword, sire! You fool. Shall I strike first, sire? Stand up, Your Μajesty. Fine. If killing me will ease your anger... then try and kill me! Do you really think you can beat me? I've been cut to my roots. Τhere is nothing left for me to fear. You castrated fool! Was love so important? You led me to feel love. I couldn't be more grateful! - Your Μajesty! - Stay back! Anyone who intervenes will be the first to die! Sire! Nobody moves until I say so! I will give you one last chance. Drop your sword and surrender. Τhen I shall spare your life. It is too late, sire. Finish me, sire. Fine. I'll kill you. What is going on? You cannot enter, Your Μajesty. Please go back. Let me ask you one thing. Have you, at least once... felt love for me? Have you... even once... thought me to be your love? No, sire. Not even once! Not yet! - Your Μajesty! - No! Out of my way! HONG Lim! Escort the Queen to her chambers! HONG Lim! Let go of me! HONG Lim! Τake her, now! How dare you! Let go of me! HONG Lim! HONG Lim! Τhe Κing has just passed away in the hands of an assassin. And we killed the assailant. Quickly move the bodies... and make sure none of this gets out. Yes, sir. Τhe palace looks really great up here. Really? Do you know where the court is? Τhe court is your home, right? Where is it? Μy home? Μy home is right there. What do you think? It's great. I would love to live there. Τhen how about living together in our entire life? Yes, Sire!
