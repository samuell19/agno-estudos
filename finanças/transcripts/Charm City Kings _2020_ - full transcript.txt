Bones get all outta whack. Should be a'ight if you treat it. And how you know that? I work at the animal hospital sometimes. Picked up a few things. I guess we gotta do my baby right, huh? See, Mouse... if there's one thing I learned while I was locked up... if you down bad, you really find out who in your corner. See, everybody talk that loyal shit. When it's time to be loyal, everybody disappear. You see niggas like that? You need to be more wise about who you're making friends. Somethin' your brother should've been a whole lot better at. What are you doin'? Yo, I'm a samurai. Nigga, you a sumo wrestler. Shut up. You ruinin' my Zen, dude. Ay! Don't start this bullshit. Ay! What's going on, yo? What the fuck it look like, nigga? We chillin'. So I guess y'all ain't comin' to the shop no more, huh? Y'all niggas some whores, yo! For real. How y'all gonna leave me hangin'? Nigga, look! I'm not working for free in no hot-ass auto shop! Swear to God, that shit be hot as fuck. It ain't for free. You gonna get a bike at the end of it. Nigga, it's the summer! We supposed to be havin' fun! Swear to God, that nigga Blax like a mean-ass principal. Real mean. Like a crooked-ass soccer coach. You letting him Mr. Miyagi you, my nigga. Oh, really? Wash that. Paint this. Fuck all that shit! Mr. Miyagi? Mr. Miyagi? Daniel-san, Karate Kid? - Do you not know anything? - I don't know! It's a old movie about this Chinese dude that made this white boy his slave. That ain't what it's about! He was training him to win. He did. We could win, too! Come on! While he was doing all that fuckboy shit, too? Nigga, not me. I'm tryin' to be like them Cobra Kai niggas. They were swipin' nigga legs off, RIP! Yeah, I like the Cobra Kai. Y'all missin' the whole point. We ain't gonna get another chance like this to get a bike! No, no, no. You missin' the point. That ain't even how you go about gettin' your own bike in Baltimore City, yo. How you do it, then? Huh? Like that. Here come Mr. Miyagi number two. Damn. Just that easy. Yeah. Came over here yelling. For real. - Yo, poor Mouse, yo. - Damn it! He real-life confused. He don't know how he like his eggs. He don't know what sock to put on first. Smartest people ruin your life. Nigga thinks he's so fine. Man, fuck the police. Yeah, fuck the police. Mouse, come sit up front. I told you, I ain't no snitch. I'm not asking, I'm telling you. Come sit up front. You know Tupac grew up in Baltimore, right? How can I not know that? That's all you old folks ever talk about. "Tupac from Baltimore." Who cares? Nigga died, like, a million years ago. I saw you at the Ride. I thought we talked about keeping that quad - off the main streets. - No. - You talked about that. - Where you been at today, yo? Minding my business. Well, your mama think you at the animal hospital. And the animal hospital think you out sick. And I find you with the homies lookin' pretty damn healthy. Can't jerk around your job, yo. Job. Pretty sure a job gotta pay. Oh, they pay you. When I hooked you up over there, I made sure of that. Uh, barely. Not even minimum wage. That's because they can't. You're not old enough yet. They give you what they can, when they can, off the books. What you want me to do with that? You know exactly what to do with that. Go to work. Keep your nose clean and don't let me see you on them damn bikes again. I'm not playin', Mouse. Do not get me twisted. I will lock your little ass up. ♪ All day all day ♪ ♪ I've been working all day ♪ Oh, shit! - God damn! - You like that? ♪ All day all day... ♪ Look at that torque, bro! God! This that CRF.

Yeah, you. You been working your ass off all week. Everybody, even Mouse, get his time to shine. A helmet? What I look like? You look like somebody that'd crash if there's time to get into a chase. That's what you look like. Well, come on. Okay. This bike clean. Clean title, everything, man. - So make sure you can handle it. Go ahead, start it up. - Yeah. - Hey, look.

This is what happens when you listen to Blax. Hey, what's with Stro's helmet? None of your business. Hey, I, uh... I'll hit y'all up. Yo! What the fuck. Bro, did you see the shocks on that shit? It was all right. Like I was sayin' I'm not playin'... Come on. New bike? It's a loaner. Looks fast. Whatever you think, it's faster than that. Trust me. Where your grandmama? Work. Get on. - You got it? - Yeah. Hm. It's a special helmet. - Tell you about it later. - Okay. - You ready? - Yeah. Hold on tight. Is this your brother's helmet? Yeah. When Stro died, my mom just throwed out a bunch of his stuff. Got rid of it. I told her to let me keep the helmet... because I know he would've wanted me to have it. What was he like? Stro was such a good dude. Real good dude. I mean, everybody loved him. Everybody. He was my mama's firstborn and she loved Stro. I mean, she loved-loved him. I know she loved him more than she loved me. Don't say that. I miss him. You know, he used to always talk about how he was gonna take me to the ocean. Always used to be goin' on, and on, and on about how much I'd love it. You never been? To the ocean. No. What about "The Ride's like the ocean"? Stop trippin', bro. That's what he used to always say. You're talking about a dude that ain't ever been outside West Baltimore before. I know I haven't either. And I know he probably wanted the best for me, but it's like... Hey, Mouse. Ah, man, what you do that for? Candid. No posing. - The real you. - Aw, man, bump all of that. How do you even work this joint? A'ight, let me show you. Let me show you. Focus. Crank. Okay, you did that... and then take the picture. Focus. Crank it. Take the picture. You got it. We'll go one day. Where? The ocean. When are you leaving? About a month from now. Will you wait for me? Mm-hmm. Not yet. Yo, Mouse. You Mouse, right? - Yeah. - I'm D. I used to hang with your brother, Stro. Yeah, Derrick, right? I remember you. What's up, bro? Yeah, man, let me get a ride on that thing. Ah, nah, man, it's not even mine. - I'm just holdin' it. - Come on, man. Just let me get a ride, man. I'm not goin' nowhere. I'm just gonna be right here. To the corner and back. Uh... What, you scared? Don't be scared, bro. I'm not goin' nowhere. They're waitin'. I ain't even say I was scared. I'm just... Well, let me get a ride on the bike. No. You just goin' up the block and comin' right back? To the corner and right back, bro. A'ight. - To the corner and right back. - To the corner and back. Got no space back here, man. I'm takin' it around the block. Shit! What the actual fuck were you thinking? Why would you even let somebody ride that bike? Swear to God, I wouldn't let no one touch Blax's shit. I know. I fucked up. I know. A'ight. I wanna know why Blax lettin' you just walk around like shit cool. You ain't tell him. You ain't tell... What are you waiting for? I mean, it ain't like you any less dead when that nigga find out. I know the nigga who took it. What's his name, yo? Derrick. - Damn. - Derrick, Derrick? - Live around the way, Derrick? - Yeah, that Derrick. Yo, that boy stay choppin' up bikes, Mouse. That shit's gone. Forever. Man, I don't even know why I be talkin' to y'all, see... Okay, okay, okay, look. What you wanna do, then? I mean, 'cause I could find out where that nigga stay at. Stomp his ass into a pavement right quick. How's that gonna help? Huh? Who knows? Maybe it won't. I mean, but if you got a Derrick pancake stuck on the bottom of your shoe... At least Blax'll know you ain't no punk. I'd be still thinking he a little punk. You did let his bike get took. Nigga, I'd rather be half a punk who got his ass beat than a whole punk who didn't do nothin'. We with you. What you wanna do? Let's go. So, you got Blax's bike stolen, and you ain't get a kiss? So, what now? You gonna call her? Yeah, and look thirsty? Nah, bro. So you dud her. Can we talk about somethin' else, please? I'm gonna keep it G-real with you. I don't like the light in here. It like a fuckin' horror story, yeah? Yeah, this it. Shit look like a old meat locker. Probably 'cause it is. I bet you that nigga in there. Okay, so we can go in there and be, like, "Excuse me, sir, "do you mind stepping out your humble abode so we could beat the ever-lovin' shit out you?" - Hey, yo, Derrick! - Ay! - Yo, Derrick! - Shut up. Stop. - God damn it. Fuck. - Fuck you doin' here, Mouse? Bike's gone. Wasn't mine. It was M.N.C. Blax's bike. You don't know no fuckin' M.N.C. Blax. Why the fuck would you do me like that, huh? This shit happen all the time. You know this. Nah, it's different. We go way back, bro. It's messed up. Yeah, well, you live and you learn. We all gotta eat. Go home, Mouse. Let's just go. Fuck that. - Let's just go. - Fuck that. Y'all ain't hear what the fuck I just said? Get the fuck out of here before I fuck y'all up. Who you think you're fuckin' up, yo? All of y'all, don't push me! Nigga, I'm pushing. What's up? - Ay, Lamont. Let's just go. - Yo, yo, fucking chill, Lamont. You ain't gonna do shit. - You heard what the fuck I said! - Whoa! Whoa! Yo! Yo! Fuckin' chill, yo. - Get the fuck away from him. - Put that gun down. - Lamont, ay! - Talk that tough shit now! Lamont! Let's go! That's what the fuck I thought. Didn't I say dip? Roll out! - Let's go! - Let's go! Derrick, right? We already know. Don't too many people get away with stealin' no bikes and we don't know about it. I see you got your little strap. I used to play with them, too. Until I got on parole. I ain't got it, but y'all got it? Is a fat baby heavy? Shit. Don't get done up by no girl, nigga. You know who I am, right? - M.N.C. Blax. - Shut the fuck up, nigga. That was a rhetorical question. Man, I can start to pay you now, man. - We can figure somethin' out. - It's already figured out. - Hey, look, I'mma tell you one time. - Fuck wrong with you? We catch you touchin' one of our fuckin' bikes and I'm gonna blow your fuckin' brains out, nigga. You understand me? Yo. Yo. That's what you do to a nigga that took your bike? Talk? It got out he took our shit without repercussions, that's on us. - You M.N.C. Blax. - It's already over with, man. This nigga need the shit beat out of him, for real. I said we out. Yo, we out, yo. Thanks, man. Thanks, Blax, man... Oh, shit. - Yo, chill. - Lamont. Oh. Lamont. Oh, shit. Now who talkin' that tough shit? - Come on, boy, nigga... - Yo, chill! Lamont! Yo, get off of him. Lamont, get off of him. He needed that. He needed that. Yo. Yo! Yo! Chill. Young boy, young boy, chill. Chill, chill. Don't need you catching no body just yet. Learned your lesson, right? Bitch-ass nigga. Talk. I-I stopped by the park real quick. And then this dude just fuckin' jacked me. So he put a gun to you? So, how he jack you? Well, he, uh, I let him ride it for, like, two seconds, and he just, he took off and he just left and I was... What did I tell you about that, man? Didn't I tell you don't never let another man make you feel like this? Not even if it's me. You come in here stuttering, with your head down. Men don't act like that. You sure you even ready for this shit? I ain't got time to keep twisting your arm around. I got shit to do. - You hear me? - Yeah. Yeah. You on clean-up duty from now on, man. If you don't get this shit right, we ain't gettin' back to what we're supposed to. You do what you gotta do, then maybe we could get back to what we was doin'. Maybe. - Cheap ass. - What you doin' after this? Me? Finna get two girls this year. One in seventh, one in eighth. Play it right, they won't even know about each other, yo. Fuck you talkin' about? You already got two. Leftquisha and Rightina. Shut your ass up, yo. You always gangin' up on me. I only use my right. Yo. Not your fat ass. - What's up? - What they call you? Lamont. You went hard on that bitch-ass nigga that took your bike. Yeah, that shit had me trippin', for real. Yeah? I thought you was gonna kill him. You stopped me. Bluffin'-ass li'l nigga. You trying to get some money? What are you lookin' back for? That's what I'm trying to figure out. Yeah. I don't really be fucking with kids, but I'mma holler at you.

I quit my job to work here, and that's money I don't have. It's money my family could use. I don't know what you talkin' about. I got bikes for you, Mouse. Put me on. Put you on what?

You're busy? Yeah, busy. Who are these people? These are my friends from school. And they live here year-round. You know what? I was actually finna get going anyway. Mouse. You'll wait for me, though, right? Let's go, Mouse. Look, I know that was messed up, but if you wanna go to the movies, - I can take you. - Shut up. Where you get all of this? What is this? Why are you going through my stuff? I ain't gonna ask you again. It's money. Little boy, don't play with me. Where you get all of this? Huh? Vet don't pay that much, and hell, you ain't been going there no way. I earned it. - How? - Working. Workin' for who? Some dudes. What fuckin' dudes, Myron? Some dudes I been ridin' bikes with. I done lost one of my sons to these fuckin' streets and if you think I'm finna lose another one it ain't gonna be while you up under this fuckin' roof! You know what? Get the fuck out. Get the fuck out my house. Get the fuck out, Myron. Where the fuck you want me to go? Where the fuck you think you gonna go? You a grown-ass man now, right? You a grown-ass fuckin' man now, right? What the fuck I look like takin' care of a grown-ass fuckin' man? You gettin' money, get the fuck out and figure it out! Figure this shit out, Myron! I ain't fuckin' playin' with you! Myron! All the shit I've done for you, boy. This the shit you gonna do. All the fuckin' shit I have done for you. You know what it took me to... Fuckin' shit! Shit! Yo, Sophie. M.N.C. Blax. Detective Rivers. I just came through to check you out. It's not a official visit. Your P.O. didn't send me. It don't matter, 'cause I ain't dirty anyway. That's good, brother, that's good. Finally gettin' yourself together after all this time, huh? And after all of this time, you still runnin' around here acting like you better than niggas, huh? Shit don't change, huh? We closed, so what's up? You know, they used to have this program called BPD Buddies. It got cut a few years back. Budget constraints. But what it was, it allowed cops to go inside of schools and be a mentor. Mine was Mouse. I mean, this little boy, man. This little boy blew me away. I mean, anything that you wanted to know about an animal, whether it was the life expectancy of a frog or the diet of an arctic fox, I mean, he could just recall it from his memory just like that. I probably learned more from him than he learned from me. The more we got to know each other, the more I got to know what he's been through. How his brother died in that police raid and all that. That's tragic stuff, brother. So, I started digging. And guess whose name came up? You. Bryan Tarver. And I said to myself, I said, "Man, I know this guy. Bryan, Bryan. Yeah! Bryan from the West Side. Grew up on the same block. Yeah. Little big-head-ass Bryan, used to follow behind us and shit. Yeah, I know him. Turned out to be one cold-hearted brother, but yeah, I know him." Man, nigga, you don't fuckin' know me. Maybe you right. I thought I did. But I had no idea how cold - M.N.C. Blax really was. - Nigga, you don't know shit. I know when we found Stro, he had, like, what? 800, 900 on him. And what kid you know from West Baltimore got that kinda cash on him unless he trappin'? Stro don't trap. I was lookin' out for Stro. Well, you did a hell of a job. No matter how you cut it, Bryan... this on you, ain't it? Ain't none of your fucking business. Now what else you want? I wanna make sure that the same thing doesn't happen to Mouse. I wanna make sure that the same thing doesn't happen to any of these other young Black boys followin' your ass down the same road. I know you ain't just said what I think you said. Black boys? What about Black boys? You don't give a fuck about Black boys. Matter of fact, you ain't even Black no more, nigga. You blue. Bitch-ass nigga. That's why Mouse don't wanna be around you now. Fuckin' joke. He know I'm the only nigga around here that care about him. Only nigga around here that ain't on a payroll to act like he care about him. Ah. Okay. You and I both know... that the best thing that could ever happen to Mouse is for a nigga like you to be out of his life forever. Let me ask you somethin', Blax. Bryan. Does Mouse know what really happened to Stro? Figures. Oh, Mouse, if you gonna be stayin' at my house, don't be using my toothbrush, a'ight? That shit's nasty, yo. Yeah, whatever, yo. I'm tellin' you, nigga, these are O.G. Nigga, these are better than those, though. - Here we go. - I'm tellin' you, yo. - This is the best shit ever. - They're not even made the same, yo. Yes, they are. - What're you talkin' about, yo? - No, they not. They way different textures. No, they're not. They're both gummy. - They're literally both gummy. - Those are Sour Patch Kids. - These are gummy bears. - But they're both gummies. - Hey, yo. Jamal was right about us. - They're sour. - Fuck you talkin' about? - Here we go. He was right about us, a'ight? We doin' the same shit we always used to do. We just sittin' on some borrowed bikes. Hey, nigga. I love my borrowed bike. Oh, yeah? What happens if you wreck it? What you think Jamal gonna say? What you think Jamal gonna do? Forgive and forget? Take a couple thousand dollar loss and just move on? I mean, seriously, did y'all even think about the deal we took when we got these bikes? - Nigga, did you? - Yes. And I am now. So what would you like us to do, then, Mouse? Make our own money. Get our own bike. That's the kinda shit we need to be on, yo. Ay, look, it's like this. As long as we keep holdin' our hands out, we always gonna be seen as some little kids. And I don't know about y'all, but I'm sick and tired of grown folks runnin' my life. Boys wait for other people. Men go out and get it. I'm tryin' to go get it. How the fuck we supposed to do that, Mouse? Huh? We can just rob that motherfucker right there. - Is you high? - Nah, think about it. We'll get the props we need for actually doin' something. Something real. And we can get the cash to get all our bikes. It's a win-win. Yeah. Yeah, it'd be easy. Old man Kim ain't gonna put up no fight. We get in, we get out, we get the cash, we get our own bikes. And we prove to Jamal we down for whatever. And we get to fuck with them racist ass. Yeah. Y'all do know this, that's a real crime, right? Jail time. Doin' our nickel. Don't drop the soap, like... The fuck you think we've been doin' for Jamal? Delivering pizzas? Let's go get it. I don't know. Y'all know y'all still babies, right? - We know we ready, Queen. - What we tryin' to tell you is we ain't no fuckin' babies, bro. Yo, Jamal. J! Come here, right fast. Hold up, yo. Yeah? J, they tryin' to tool up. Say what? Say they need a strap. Give 'em one. One, though. Yo, Queen. Give it to that little nigga. You bet. Man, come on. Whoo... Pay up. Yeah. Pay. Yo! Hey, yo. Let me holler at you, yo. Yo, what's up? You makin' it hot out here. What you doin'? I see you holdin' court out here. Yeah, it's the shit you taught me. Keep the money and the work separate. What's the problem? Nigga, I'm on parole. You know if the cops come up in here, I'm done. All right. We gonna chill. I'll let niggas know we can't be ridin' here. Cool? What else? - Fall back off Mouse. - No. That little nigga a trapper. Gotta keep him around, he good. Just like Stro. Fall back off Mouse, nigga. Yeah, whatever. Tell that little nigga to bring my shit back and go ahead about his business. Oh, yeah, and if you still tryin' to save the youth and shit... he came asking for a piece.

You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can be held against you in a court of law. You have the right to an attorney. If you cannot afford one, one will be provided for you. Blax.
