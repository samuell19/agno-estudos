Twenty years ago, I was still a teenager. I turned on the color TV my family had just bought and noticed the 555 Hong Kong-Beijing Rally. I was shocked to find out that you can actually drive a car like that. So I made up my mind to become a rally driver, too, when I grew up. In 1999, the World Rally Championship was held in China. Without telling my family, I took the train to Beijing to watch the championship. When the rally cars whizzed past me, it became clear that this would be my passion, and I would keep striving for it. Eventually, I did become a rally driver. I put on the helmet and fastened the seat belt. Listening to the co-driver's pace notes, I am like a newborn. Now I could finally compete with the best Chinese drivers whom I have only seen on TV. My co-driver and I were getting better and stronger as well. Bayanbulak... is 4,000 kilometers above sea level and includes dangerous cliffs, forests and snowy mountains. The highest honor of Chinese racing is to win the Bayanbulak championship. I won five times in a row. I was 32 that year. Then you were born. And that year, I've been unable to compete due to certain circumstances. It just so happened you haven't been able to see me competing in a single race. But it doesn't mean that daddy is lying to you, or that the racing suit is fake. - Understand? - Yes. What do you think I'll look like if I put on the suit? A food delivery guy. What do you mean "a food delivery guy"? That's not what I'll look like. Are you getting the idea? When I was wearing this suit back then, I couldn't lose. I won the championship for five consecutive years. Son, does daddy still look like a food delivery guy? Here's your food-- Why the attitude, buddy? Welcome to the midday broadcast brought to you by FM111.1. Former famous race car driver, Zhang Chi, is holding a surprise automobile association hearing today. The details regarding the hearing are unclear. I will go to the scene and report on the hearing first hand. Many people are unfamiliar with this name. Like people say, "A misstep causes a lifelong regret." Why are they taking pictures of you? Daddy is a celebrity, and you are the son of a celebrity. Zhang Chi, please say a few words. Five years ago, I fell and hit rock bottom in life. It was you guys who wrote all those articles about me, some were true, some were not, stripping me bare to the public. You had also prompted the people not to forgive me, which made me fall even lower. Today, I'll win back the honors... one by one. I, Zhang Chi, am back once I get through this gate. Sir, the X-ray can't penetrate your jumpsuit. Please take it off and go through again. After you've easily won your fifth championship, your long-time rival, Wan Heping, announced his retirement as well. Do you have anything to say to him? Not so much of a rival. Rivals are like... And we were like... His personal best was the second place and there were quite a few years when he ranked third or fourth. - Hm. - I think he is the kind of person who looks like an overachiever. If the two of us are standing together, he looks like the one with five championship titles. Some people live off their looks, others just create a fake image of themselves. But I live off my skills. Besides, he's not getting any younger. Maybe someday, when we see each other outside of racing, it will be quite different. Plaintiff, Mr. Zhang Chi, please address the reason behind your suspension. It was May 4th, 2012. I received an invitation. Why are you racing in the minor leagues when you're already in the big leagues? Well, since you're here, I guess I'll put my racing shoes on. Although I was driving an old Santana, I relied on my skills from many years of racing and beat everyone. Unexpectedly, the police had laid down a trap. I was as light as a bird... ...flying over walls. I was a real athlete... dodging left and right. - After a series of moves, I-- - Stop, stop, stop. No need to exaggerate. Just the facts. Okay. In that case... You were a professional race car driver... with no similar incidents. Why did you accept such an invitation out of nowhere? Because... ...the owner of the old Santana told me that if I can win the race, they would... take care of my son's... residence registration and school enrollment. During my five-year suspension, I've been nothing but a law-abiding citizen with no disorderly conduct. All I want... is to race again. You took away my honor as punishment, which is fine. But I'm begging you, please give me a chance to race again. I want to win my honor back... again. Order, please. For him, he can do anything that's not prohibited by law. And for the arbitration court, we mustn't do anything unless it's authorized by law. So as long as he complies with racing regulations, and passes a physical examination, he can race again. Okay. Meeting adjourned. This is the selfless and impartial Chairman Wan. - Call him uncle. - Big brother. - You taught your son well. - Mr. Wan... back then, I was pretty arrogant. It's all right. But I'm telling you, as long as you get your driver's license back, your competition license will be reactivated automatically. The drivers nowadays are a lot faster than we were. Lin Zhendong has been winning every year for a long time. - You need to work harder. - Thank you. By the way, this time you'll know what it feels like to lose. Bye, Grandpa. This is Lin Zhendong's new race car. Daddy will come back this year and destroy Lin Zhendong. And really "open your eyes." That's a new idiom for you. Come on, repeat the new idiom to Daddy. "Destroy Lin Zhendong." I should spank you. Idioms are usually made up of four words. Well, sometimes they can be five. Off you go. Over there. Write the new idiom 20 times. "Destroy Lin Zhendong." Daddy, why did you name me Zhang Fei? All my classmates make fun of me. What's so funny about your name? My father's name is Zhang Yang. He lived up to his name to be very arrogant and suffered for it. So he wanted Daddy to be more in control of his life. That's why Daddy's name is Zhang Chi. And I ended up flying high. I became a race car driver and a champion. What I want for you is to be like Daddy, keep flying in life. And together, we're a team called Fei Chi. That's why your name is Zhang Fei. Is that a problem? Does Liu Bei disapprove, or is it Guan Yu? One of my classmates' father is also a driver. He wants to race you. We can't agree to random car races anymore. After Daddy wins this year's race, I'll go meet him. SUN YUQIANG Hello, is this Yuqiang? Brother. Not another word. I've been waiting for your call for five years.

Zhang Chi, let go of my wife! Bro... Bro, I just released all my emotions on your wife. There's nothing left. So, maybe your wife can tell you what I said. There's no need. I get it. I know you wouldn't just let go. But whether I can return to car racing or not, depends on my wife, Sui Sui. You can go. Just be safe. Rest assured, we won't come home without a win. So this is my last day working here. Let me take you on the roller coaster after work to get the feeling back. How is it going with the car assembly? We don't even have a car yet. Holy shit!

His career prospects are looking bleak. Deader than dead. And he's facing huge claims from sponsors and his car team... I guess he's not just bankrupt. He also has a lot of debt. - Let's figure it out. - Add it up. You all came to kiss my ass when things were good. Now that I'm in trouble, you can't even give me one or two more days? Selling cars and watches takes time too! Shit! FEI CHI TASTY FRIED RICE No. 1018, Zhang Chi, we have your paternity test result.

See you tomorrow after school! ♪ And we will make amends ♪ ♪ Could it be a dream ♪ ♪ My father's son that's me ♪ We haven't sat in a car like this for a long time. Yeah. I haven't touched a steering wheel for 1,852 days. I know it's a real blow for you to retake the test. We'll nail it the first time. This is the first step of our road back to glory. Start the car. Who the hell are you? Don't you know where to sit? Get in the back. Why was your license revoked five years ago? Uh... - Drunk driving. - Drunk driving? I hate drunk drivers the most. You are not going to pass the test in my car. No, no! No, no, sir. Don't listen to him. He's kidding. He's drunk. No, I'm drunk. Don't listen to him. It was because I was driving too fast. My driver's license was revoked for speeding. Speeders are the other type I hate the most. Instructor... your call. I'll be whoever you want me to be. Can you let go of my hand? I've been driving for 26 years. I've never even had a little scratch, let alone an accident. It's all because of my cautiousness. I hate those people who have only been behind the wheel for a few days, but think their skills are off the charts. - It's like-- - Instructor, let me introduce him... He was the national-- Is it your turn to speak now? Who are you? Instructor... - I once-- - You once what? You once traveled through mountains and seas, and huge crowds of people. That's right. Everything I once had... all drifted away like mist in an instant. Singing, huh? People whose driver's licenses are revoked for speeding are all crazy. You don't even seem like you can work the clutch. You're telling me you can drive fast? Then show me. I really can. Go ahead. I have the auxiliary brake here. It'll be better if you don't hit the auxiliary brake while I'm driving. It will disrupt the equilibrium of the car. Who are you really? For the first time in five years... ...finally, there is someone telling me I can drive fast. When starting in a civilian FWD car, you need to control the strength of the left leg at the critical point of releasing the clutch pedal. This way, it can have a better grip. Who the hell are you? You're about to find out. Bear with me, please. I know who you are. You are... an idiot. Zhendong, when will we go to Finland to test the cars this year? In this bad economy, it's too much trouble to bring the car team abroad. So, I'm doing a little practice on my own race track. Zhendong, I know you have a big fan base, a really big one, and you've made it into Forbes Sports top ten list for three years in a row, but somehow, people still think you just have more resources than everybody else, more money, better cars. What do you think about that? I've invested more than anybody else, whether in terms of money or experience. So, I think it only makes sense that I win more than others. Does the winner have to be someone who's not invested as much as I am in every aspect just to satisfy your fairy tale ending? Besides, I've got the best co-driver. So you think this is also fair. If you want fairness, then come and race. But if you want absolute fairness, then don't. Do we have any competitive opponents this year? Let me think. Gao Huayang. His English name is Tall. Forget about him. He hasn't been able to finish one race after all these years, right? Anyone else? Ke Xiang, a driver who's even younger than you. He did pretty well in the Estonian Championship last year. - What about Zhang Chi? - He's incredible. He took the driver's license test and failed Subject 2. Subject 2--? Well, Subject 2 is pretty hard. I failed it too. Nice new car, Instructor Tian. What do you want? Instructor Tian, it was my fault last time. I stepped too hard. I'm here to apologize and make amends. No need to apologize, as long as you make amends. I did some homework. Fifteen years ago, your best friend got hit by an idiot who was speeding while driving drunk, and your friend has been in a vegetative state ever since. Since then, you and his wife have been looking after him everyday. - Day after day, and night after night. - Don't mention the past. I used to be an instructor as well. What did you teach? Rally, track, drifting, autocross, and specialty driving for the police force. I've trained over 2,400 students, and I was a very good professional race car driver myself. How good? The best. To be honest, it's not you that I hate. It's that long-haired guy you were with last time. Look at him, such a sissy. Am I right? It's good that he's not here today. So, we'll-- I'm ready, Instructor. When did you get in? - Get out. - Don't be mad, Instructor. We've made some inquiries. Your car engine is 10,000 RMB. We'll pay you back. Please give him one more chance. Give him a chance. The engine is 10,000 RMB. Why did you give me 20,000? ♪ I once traveled ♪ ♪ Through mountains and seas ♪ ♪ And huge crowds of people ♪ ♪ Everything I once had ♪ ♪ All drifted away Like mist in an instant ♪ ♪ I was so lost and frustrated That I completely lost my way ♪ ♪ Not until I live the ordinary life Will I find the only answer ♪ ♪ I destroyed everything I once had ♪ ♪ Wanted to leave for good ♪ ♪ I fell into the endless darkness ♪ ♪ Wanted to get out but there was no way ♪ ♪ I was like you Him and the wild flowers ♪ ♪ Feeling devastated and anxious While crying, laughing and being average ♪ ♪ I once traveled Through mountains and seas... ♪ Instructor, when should I come back?

There's no time to let it breathe. We're gonna finish this bottle. I really want to race you in the championship. So, if there's anything I can help with, just let me know. - What do you mean? - I watched you race when I was 18. The way that you drove was more aggressive, and your posture was more exaggerated than others. - I was just like... - I get it. That was the first time you've ever watched... a rally race in your life. It left an indelible impression on your young mind. Who would've thought I was almost the one who inspired your career? It was a smart decision for my family to send me to Britain to learn racing when I was 13... so that I could see your flaws and weaknesses. You were using too much Scandinavian pendulum to shift. There's no need for that in today's rally. I came back at the age of 20, but you were suspended from racing. I've been winning pretty easily for five years now. Well, that's good. But there are so many doubts about me. They think that I've only been winning because you aren't there. Starting next year, I won't enter any more races in China. But I really hope I can race against you first. Then what? So there won't be any more doubts about me. WRITING BOOK DESTROY LIN ZHENDONG I'm not like you guys. I never pay attention to other drivers. Hm? I heard you haven't found your sponsor yet. Here's my phone number. If you have any problems, come find me. All my life, you and the policemen are the only people... who have said that to me. Don't worry. There won't be any problems. I have many friends. The wine we just drank was from a good friend. They are all industry giants. Maybe you know them too. It shouldn't be much of a problem to get sponsored. I'll see you in the race. The friendships you have when things are good, may not be as strong as you think. That chateau didn't produce even one bottle of red wine in 1991 because they didn't think it was a good year. That bottle of wine is fake. I hope this year is a good year for both of us. Go home now. If we're making a comeback, we're gonna do it with a proper look. What do you think? How does this new team uniform look? It was the first time we entered a rally race. We started the car at No.1246, Tianma Road. This year is also a new beginning for us. You look pretty sharp... in this picture. What picture did you choose for me? Is it the one when I was spraying champagne in Mohe? Or the one when I was jumping really high on the podium after the final battle of Bayanbulak? Bro, due to our limited funds, it's also me. That's what we're going to use. Holy shit, the damper brake on this car isn't bad. Look, the air pump is directly driven by the paddle. Before, we shifted like this. Now, just like this. Does our car have the same configuration as this one? Yuqiang, we've been driving here for seven years. Considering my close relationship with Manager Ye, there's no problem getting a car with the same configuration as their best driver. The car team rents this car to other clients at 200,000 for one round. 150,000. Left three is next to right four. Two hundred meters straight after the hill jump. Right six full gas at the big tree. Sprint ahead. Look back. We won! We won! Awesome! Awesome! Awesome! Manager Ye. The past few years haven't been easy for you. Every now and then, you need to take care of your mental health. I wasn't allowed to drive. So, I've been doing some simulated driving in my head. I fell into the zone just now. Yuqiang. It's been a long time. How have you been? You've also been doing simulated driving? I got carried away by him. I've always thought very highly of you. You were always so passionate about racing, and you have literacy skills. So, we're all here again. Why don't you lighten the mood a bit and make up a poem? - No, no, I can't. - Come on. - Freestyle. - My poems are all condemnatory. - That's okay, criticize me. - That's right, criticize him. - All right, I'll try. - Come on. Doing actions of a fierce tiger... Oh? ...look closely, still stuck in the same spot. Impressive. Okay, that's enough. - We shall stop here. - Manager Ye, we are here to go over the contract again and then have a look at my car. Mm... I was gonna call you to save you the trouble of coming down here. About the car, we can't rent it to you. Why not? We had a deal six months ago. The race is almost here. Well, there's been a dispute about your comeback. The boss is worried about the sponsors seeing you drive their car. And he thinks it will somehow affect their sponsorship of our company. How about this? I'll pay you the full 200,000. You don't need to give me a discount, okay? Your company has a rental business too. Rent the car to me. I'm your client. We don't have to know each other. I'm your client, okay? It's not about money, you know? This year is very important to us. This year is important to me too. I know, but you have to understand that this is a public company. We're under so much pressure. If renting the car to you upsets the sponsors, then what? Our team has won six annual championships. Five of them were won by me. The race is in 40 days. Where am I going to find a car? Yeah, but what you did a few years ago... What you did a few years ago damaged the reputation of our company as well. You didn't know? The company's stock price dropped for a year and a half before it recovered. I'm so sorry, Yuqiang. I've tried everything. - It's okay, doctor. - No. Manager Ye... Can the two of you please get out of the car? We need to lift the gearbox. Thank you both for your contribution to the team. Wait. Here. Be careful when you make a turn. This is the frame of the race car you drove. It used to be displayed in the lobby of the company headquarters. And after what happened, it was dumped in the warehouse. This is the championship frame from five years ago. I can still remember the smell... ...and the familiar touch. This is the king of Bayanbulak. I can still feel its obstinateness and tiny universe is connecting with me. Zhang Chi, put your hands on it. Can you feel the connection? I'm connecting as well. Hey! Actually, this is the frame from your car. It's already so many years old, basically discarded. So, it doesn't need to fall under the company's financial audit. It's at the car team's disposal. So tomorrow night, you guys can come and sneak it out of here. But don't let anyone see you. My friend has an empty wine cellar downtown. I'll send you the address later. Here is the key. This is the championship frame from five years ago. I can still remember the smell and the familiar touch. - It is truly-- - Okay, okay. It's connecting. Let's figure out how to get it out of here first. Daddy, what is this? Don't touch it. It's Daddy's weapon. It's called an expandable baton. If there is an accident later, it will be very useful. But you can't play with it. Hurry up. Halt. What are you two guys doing? Three guys. Sir, aren't you supposed to be taking a bath? I took a quick one. How did you know I took a bath? Who are you? Sir, it's very complicated to explain. But I suggest you don't try to stop us. I've made up my mind. I-- I-- Dad, what's wrong with your weapon? Your dad was too hard on it, so it got stuck. I've made up my mind. Young man, stop trying. Your flashlight won't work, no matter how hard you try. Don't try to stop me. You will never know... how scary it is when a driver and his vehicle become one. That guy we once knew is back. - What are you doing? - Bear with me. So, you're going for a launch! Pretty scary, huh? Bros... it's just a piece of junk to you, but it's something really precious to me. Just think of me as a garbage collector who wants to collect this piece of junk. Okay? Don't think that... - Let him go. - Huh? I'll go with them. Ji Xing. Ji Xing. ♪ I used to ♪ ♪ Drift around like the floating flowers ♪ ♪ Scared to fall in love for no reason ♪ ♪ It was fate that I finally met you ♪ ♪ When I first met you ♪ ♪ You were stunning in the crowd ♪ - Ji Xing. - Yes. Remember when the three of us worked together? I just remember you said, "No matter how bad you guys crashed the car, I could always fix it for you." This is something I'll remember forever. It's all in the past. In the past. The best Head of Pit Crew in the whole country. You must've been promoted to be a supervisor by now. I... went backstage. What happened? There was a race one year. I was in a hurry, trying to save time. The lifting jack wasn't placed right. I crawled under the car to remove the windboard. The car fell... on top of me. I broke my hand. So I... I voluntarily asked to retire from the front line to manage the warehouse. This is so serious. How come we didn't know anything about this? Ah... It was... disgraceful. They were afraid of negative press. What happened to you scared the hell out of them. Enough. Get me some tools. Let's get started. What's our budget? I made a little more than 300 grand cooking fried rice. Sui Sui and I have 100,000 in savings. I can contribute 90 grand. Then we have more than 400 grand here. Not quite. How much more than 300 grand do you have? No way we can do it with only 300 or 400 grand. We can't even afford a 4WD system. We're talking about 1.2 million here at least. And that's the bottom line for a most basic S-grade race car. Still, we'll be 0.8-second slower per kilometer than those fancy cars. A hundred kilometers in Bayanbulak, eighty seconds, almost one and a half minutes. It's okay. You go ahead. I'll figure something out. Fine. First, I need a second-hand S-grade OC engine, new forged crankshaft, connecting rods, pistons, low-friction bearings, high-angle cam, quantitative valve, high-duty valve springs, customized exhaust manifold, intake pipe, 9-degree spark plugs, OKD ignition module, quantitative fly wheel, Garrett turbine, Bosch racing ECU, Cosworth Omega, ICD, Plus data record unit, Cosworth IPS32 computer controlling system, Cosworth speed, direction, temperature and brake pressure sensors, both front and rear chassis should be changed to the McPherson system, and WRC Reiger damper. Aluminium alloy cleat, front and rear steel barrel sub-frame, carbon fiber body, empennage, Xtrac 6-gear Sequential AWD gearbox, Xtrac rear differential, AP carbon fiber triple plate clutch, Pankl customized transmission shaft and half-shaft assembly, Bosch shift sensor, Brembo brake caliper, AP vertical pedal, Endless brake pad, ATL 75L explosion proof tank. Enough, I'll go looking for sponsors. Sit. Sit. What about him? Your assistant? I'm the one who writes down the pace notes for him, who reads them to him, the eyes of the driver. I see. Guide person. Co-driver, co-driver. Master, seeing eye dog. Sir, I only spent 40 grand a year. Eight of which I spent on you. I am the highest level VIP here. I've read your book Either Be Successful, Or Be More Successful three times. So, did you succeed? You could say that we're only one race car away from success. This is also why we're here. Maybe you can help us make an announcement in your VIP WeChat group chat to see if anyone would like to help us? Or if you want to sponsor us yourself, that would be the best. Well, sponsorships, I'm telling you... you just need to... and then you... And that's it. Sir, can you do backstroke? If you want money, just go find the rich people. I can only give you one local product. Sir, you misunderstood. We're not here to ask for money. We are here to talk about cooperation. The one in the yellow suit, I recognized you from the news. You are the... the... the... Oh, just forget it. Secretary, see them out... Dad... didn't you go looking for a sponsor? Didn't I find this pleasant looking goat for you? But the goat isn't going to cover the cost of even one race. Do your homework. It doesn't look like a place where rich people come to. You don't understand. Rich people come to places like this to look for exotic foods. Billion dollar deals are made in places like this. It will go well today. Guys. Bro. Bro, wake up. Wake up. Bro, wake up. Sorry, man. Business is bad these days. I've been so worried. I got drunk after seeing some old friends. You have connections. Can you help me with my cash flow, please? Bro, I was never here. It's all an illusion. Check. It's not that I don't have upper-class connections. It's just that when I called them, all of them are abroad on vacation. So, I went to find some old classmates. I guess there's not much hope left in my racing career. But I just really want to win this one time. I'm the kind of person... that has no story to tell. Nobody liked me in school. I didn't like anybody either. My parents are healthy. I've never had an accident or anything like that. I've never been to grad-school. I've never gotten into a fight. I've never made a girl cry in the karaoke. I've never forced a good girl into prostitution. I've never saved one from it either. It's only when I'm sitting in the race car, I find purpose in my life. Excuse me, beautiful. There's no story in your life, and you want to have one. I have too many stories. What I want is an ending. Let's get out of here. Get on. This is where my son sits. I'm serious. How about you go on a TV show? Be miserable, attract people's attention, maybe sponsorships will come. I won't do it. It's a beautiful day in October. Speak your mind, and achieve your dream. Hello, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to the third season of Making Your Dream Come True in 60 Seconds. Seeking for a sponsorship. Great! Wait, you can't let them see it now. Here. Wait until the last moment on stage, then pull up the zipper, and everyone will be focused on these three words. We'll have endless sponsorships. The audience is God. Sugar Daddy is the sponsor. I'll give you 60 seconds to shout out your dreams. God and Sugar Daddy will decide whether to fulfill your wishes immediately. Let's give a warm welcome to our very first dreamer! I think many of you born in the 80s still remember him because his story was all the rage at the time. Let's hand the show time to him. Wait. How can I forget to introduce our ambassador of dreams for today, also the sponsor of our show. Oh, silly me. Let's welcome... this man of legends... Lin Zhendong! It seems that... our young dreamer isn't feeling well. Go back. You're so close to your dream. Zhang Chi, you've been enduring this all these years. Can't you bear it just one more day? Think about little Zhang Fei and me. Don't be a coward. Okay, leave then. I'll go myself. I already quit my job anyway. Sui Sui hasn't talked to me for two weeks. I have nothing. It's always crueler out there on the track. Just think of this as a warm-up race. Let's go. Ladies and gentlemen, after a therapy session with his friend, our young dreamer is feeling well again. Okay, start the countdown! ALL THE BEST I was a racer. I hardly made any mistakes on the track. But I did something wrong off the track. I was suspended for five years. This will be the sixth year. We often say that adults' problems start with borrowing money. That's very true. Today I am here to... I don't know how to say it, so I'll just let the words on my chest speak for me. Ten. - Nine. Eight. Seven. Six. Five. Four. Three. Two. One. Game over. I know him. He wants to make a comeback, but he has run into some financial difficulties. Even then, he never asked for a single penny. He only came here to get a thumbs up from us. We have no reason to refuse. So, my suggestion is that everyone here give a thumbs up to this excellent racer! All right? Hello, anyone up there? Can we do it again? Great. Actually, there's another word. The zipper was stuck. ...two, one... - Great! - Excellent! Quiet! Life doesn't give you too many second chances. Get out of here or the next person is gonna fall on you. It's okay. At least it was an awesome scene. Let's go. Listen, Manager Ye called me. It sounds like something good might happen tomorrow. Don't be so frustrated. Come on, just smile like you always do. One, two, three. Manager Ye! Zhang Chi! Waiting for me, huh? Manager Ye. Welcome, welcome. - It's not that easy to find this place. - True. This is what we call a utopia. You were in such a rush. Do you have some good news? Have you been busy lately getting ready for the race? I, um... I got fired. You're kidding. It's fine. You know, I've always wanted to do some traveling. Now I've got some money saved up to finally do it. To see the world. - Traveling is good. - Yeah. It's too busy working in the racing team anyway. This is where I made fried rice before. Oh, my God, this view... Here, here. Here. These are the ruins of your fried rice business. I live upstairs, let's go. What a cozy apartment! The race is about to start. How is it going with the sponsors? Very well. - That's good. - Nice. Oh, I got something for you. This is the computer board you used to use. Maybe you can still use it. You have to win. Yeah, I know. ♪ Now we are all just empty shells ♪ ♪ Thinking of the glory days ♪ ♪ Grasping to freedom in stormy days ♪ ♪ Suffering through The painful times life brings ♪ ♪ I'm confident we can change the future ♪ ♪ Who can just make it right ♪ ♪ Oh... ♪ I'm gonna go. You won't stay for dinner? I've got to catch a flight to the Maldives. Next time when you see me, I'll be swimming on a tropical island. Happy break-up. Is there no other way? Okay then. I know a guy. Hello, sir. This is my friend Zhang Chi. I'm seeing obsessiveness on your face. Sir, where did you get such fascinating insight? Sir, our situation, he must have told you about it already. We were thinking... No need. I know what you are going to say. I can be your sponsor. But on one condition. You need to put my girlfriend's name on your racing suit, and wear it when you're on the podium. I want everyone in the country to know her name. Sir, that's going to be a bit too... If I were to quote a Chinese idiom, - I'm afraid that would be... - I'll give you one million. That's exactly what we need. Sir, such a loyal friend like you should have more than just one girlfriend. There's plenty of space on our racing suits. Even if I had thousands, - I only choose one in my heart. - That's a good choice. But, I have another small request. I'm the kind of person who can't carry a tune, but I like to hear other people sing. Especially the voice and dance moves of the former national champions. Sir, I can't dance. Sir, I can't sing either. ♪ Walking every day On the road that others set for you ♪ ♪ Finally you got lost And left your home ♪ ♪ From then on You had a dream of your own ♪ ♪ And you were willing to give... ♪ ♪ Everyday doing the things That others planned for you ♪ ♪ You...

Road narrows, 100 meters, right five. Sharp curve, 300 meters, full throttle, entering sandstone. The annual Bayanbulak Rally is coming up. The racing teams are all on their way. Lin Zhendong and his co-driver, Hong Kuo, will use the newest rally car in the competition. He also invited the European rally champion, McShea, to compete as a wildcard racer. The "double insurance" guarantees the car team to be the most competitive among others. Hello, Zhang Chi! I am 300 kilometers to the service ground, in about seven or eight hours. It's like a dream being on the track again. Zhang Chi, listen to me. We can definitely beat their expensive cars with our cheaper vehicle. Don't get cocky. Although, that's what I think too. The lonely smoke is rising from the vast desert. The round sun is setting slowly over the long river. As long as I hear you making up poems again, I know we've got this. Make sure you're safe... Hello? Excuse me sir, please turn off your phone for takeoff. - Okay. - Thanks. Our lives are about to take off too! ZHANG CHI SUN YUQIANG Is there still hope? Bro, I'm so sorry. I'm just glad you're okay. Ji Xing, do something. Ji Xing! I'm calling our sponsor now. I'll ask for another 500 grand. Then with the money, we can buy parts from the other teams on site. This time, we won't just embroider Zhu Chunjuan's name on the suit, I'll tattoo it on my body! Zhang Chi, do you have a backup car? Just this one. You've been racing a long time. You know the car can't be fixed under such circumstances. Plus your co-driver can't pass the physical examination. Don't push it. This is the application for withdrawal. Just sign here, then deliver it to the racing center. So, there's no hope? Money. Parts. Everything is gone. Even if we had them, there's not enough time. The referee is right. We all know how this works. No more fantasies. It'd just be a waste of time, and we'd be in everyone's way. Do you know what it means that you weren't in the race for the past five years? It probably means... that my time... has passed. Right, young man? Those five years mean that the technology has progressed. We can now do things you couldn't even imagine before. Let me take care of it. Hello, everyone, here is the Bayanbulak Rally, the highest-level competition of Chinese car racing. The unique charm of the rally is that the drivers, possessed with the highest car-control ability, challenge themselves and the limits of their cars on dangerous mountain cliffs without any protection. The rally cars depart every five minutes which means the drivers can't see each other, only the road ahead of them. This is the battle between themselves and their former performances. The one who spends the least amount of time will be the strongest driver god on this land. On the 109-kilometer mountain road, the six rescue helicopters and thirteen ambulances may not be able to fully protect their safety. Here, we get to see the art of driving, the greatest courage and concentration of professional racers, their love and dedication. We witnessed the falls of superstars and the rise of new ones. This year, we see an extremely strong and confident driver who is even willing to help his opponent to repair his car, Lin Zhendong. We also have younger drivers who are chasing closely after him, trying to be the new king. And also Zhang Chi, who has finally found sponsorship to return to the race. Even though the medical supervisor did not give his co-driver, Sun Yuqiang, permission to be in the race because of his injury in an accident beforehand, Zhang applied to use the Rule 48.3 Responsibility conceit of Blue Book, which has never been used before, to drive alone without his co-driver. No one can remember all of the thousands of corners in the Bayan stage which is filled with blind spots. Once he starts the car, he will be the loneliest driver on this land. The first half of Bayanbulak Rally is mainly sand and stone tracks through forest, afterwards contestants will have to climb Bayan mountain up to 4,000 meters with drops that for most of them can go up to more than 100 meters. This is probably the biggest difficulty that the drivers will be facing today. On top of this, the signal at the top of the mountain is pretty unstable and it is going to affect the remote sensors on the cars. Now folks, let's not forget the load on the engines and turbines has to be tremendously high during the climb, which is why many cars cannot get passed the summit. As you can see, Zhendong Lin's car has departed and I don't think there's gonna be any big surprise this year in this race. However, it's going to be quite interesting to see if he's going to be able to beat his own record. Now, I don't think anybody can really threaten his position this year apart from his teammate Niall and the two rookies Wei Shen and Dewei Fan. It looks like Lin is pretty safe here. I can't really stick to the route. I think the previous data is wrong. It's okay, probably just the nerves. I've checked, don't worry, the tire temperature hasn't come up yet. The computer board Manager Ye brought adapts to your driving habit perfectly. Okay, then I'll make the turn-in point earlier. I have to say, the S team who's departing right now is definitely showing the world how skillful they are. For me, they're really the best at building race cars! Look at this beast! It has a horsepower of 450, a torque force of 900 and an incredible weight of 1,080 kilograms. This car can go from 0 to 100 in 2.1 seconds. It has to be one of the best cars I've ever seen entering this race! Am I still slower than everybody else now? You are 0.12 seconds slower per kilometer. Not much. We still have a chance to catch up. Nine seconds behind in total. Can I adjust the turbine delay to the maximum? How much do I lead by now? Nine point six seconds. Concentrate. Is it really okay for me to drive like this? Am I falling further behind? Don't let him get into your head. Your driving rocks, not outdated. Don't you worry about it. Bro, as I said to him the other day, "One becomes outdated the day he stops believing in himself." Here is some good news. The temperature on the top of the Bayenbulak mountains has dropped and the road is more slippery. This helps us. We have a shorter wheelbase than others, but after this hill, there are a lot of high-speed curves. You might get caught up a little bit. You can push harder, but be careful, okay? Hello, everyone. Here is the live broadcast of the Bayanbulak Rally. With the recent temperature being lower than usual, everyone has somehow managed to be faster than they were last year. So, the real suspense is whether there is anyone who can break the record and finish within an hour. There have also been many accidents in the race. Han Xiaoyue in car No. 9, seemed a bit hasty. After a series of mistakes, he ended the race by crashing into a tree. When young drivers enter complex tracks like this, they need to manage the rhythm. After all, it's the world's longest-- Chen Zhi'an also seems to have encountered some problems. Did he forget about the hood lock? That will cost him at least 40 seconds to go in the pit for service. He seems to be having some sort of dispute with his co-driver. Basically he's stepped away from the competition for the podium. The wildcard driver, Niall, from Zhendong's team also withdrew from the race because of the break of the steering rod. The "double insurance" of Zhendong's team is left with only him in the race now. Fortunately, he is still ahead. Niall seems to be particularly frustrated. Oh! Some drivers are even more unfortunate. Gao Huayang, in Car No. 2, keeps having trouble with sheep. He got blocked by a flock of passing sheep. This kind of uncertainty may also be the charm of the rally. I hope Huayang can keep calm and finish the race for the first time. Shen Wei's car stopped at the roadside due to some mechanical problems. This parking spot is very dangerous. For him, this year's race has come to an end. As a veteran driver, Zhu Yuxia is still very stable. He's really-- Is it okay to drive like that? This is equivalent to saving at least 300 meters. We may have to wait for the arbitration after the game. Fan Dewei is in second place, so close on Lin Zhendong's tail. We did not expect Zhang Chi, who is driving alone, not to have fallen too far behind. Next is the most dangerous stage of the race, the Bayan Peak with the highest altitude. At such a high altitude, the mechanics of the cars will face tremendous pressure. And the continuous downhill drive is also a true test of confidence for the drivers. Defective vehicle. Now we're at the difficult section. Let's try to increase our lead. Instructor, could you teach us your secret to winning? Take out your paper and pen. I'll only say it once. Oh, you're really noting it down. What the hell are you thinking? Why should you be the only one to know the secret? Do you have more legs? More mouths? In sports competitions, success comes from practice, and champions are born from crashes. As a rally racer, if you rush on the track, there are no safety nets. There may be walls, trees, reservoirs and cliffs on the side. The key is pushing the limit while making the fewest mistakes. You will never get a second chance for every turn you make. Every mistake you make could ruin the entire race, or even your career. The sport we love is different from others. You need money. You need a good team of technicians. You need a good car. You need skills and concentration. You need to drive your car at full speed on the most dangerous roads in the world. What is dignity? Honor? A sense of shame? None of it matters. To defeat your opponent, you need to find the latest braking point, find the friction limit of your tires, push the limits of your abilities, then, attack every curve in front of you. This is not the skill of driving. This is the art of driving. There are 1,462 bends on Bayanbulak, 109 kilometers. Little tricks can get you ahead for 100 meters. But never 100 kilometers. You asked me my secret: just one word, devotion. - Six seconds. - Fully devote yourself to everything you so passionately love. You didn't conquer the land. You just beat your opponents. I simulated 20 runs a day in my head. Five years. That's thirty-six thousand times. I can remember every curve. If I'm lucky enough to get back on the track... I will definitely make the connection with you. Left two is next to right four. Go right six and turn back 200 meters. Left five to right five. Flying sky then left one. Full throttle. Zhang Chi, only 3.6 seconds now. Steady yourself. Two seconds. Two seconds. He's so close on my tail. Did I slow down? Impossible, we're even three seconds faster than last year. Watch out for the rocks. Dad, come on! You promised to beat my classmate's dad after the race. Don't worry. Wait till Daddy wins the race, that will be the post-credit scene. My front wheel seems to have hit something. The left alarm flashed. Why did the alarm light on the right flash a bit? Bayanbulak Rally is one of the most exciting race in the world and as much as people believe that its most thrilling bit is the summit, well, the final part is actually the most crucial one. Because towards the end, drivers cannot really see the turns nor the bumps and you'll see cars rushing through Bayan's canyon and jumping while surrounded on both sides by extremely dangerous cliffs. Drivers will have to be absolutely focused for the last two kilometers. If they don't take risks, they will waste some precious time on this treacherous bit and at the same time, if they push too much, they might really damage their engine. Because at the end of this part, a very sharp turn awaits them, a sharp turn and extremely high cliffs on the sides! The moment the drivers will choose to step on the brakes will be absolutely decisive. And let's not forget that even though it's the final part, drivers risk absolutely everything on it and might not be able to go back to their stands if they fail on this very last curve. Now let's cut to Skyline Sports from Europe. Wow! That was a very well executed jump! That looks like he was going full throttle in fourth gear! The engine oil is overheating. The gas pressure is dropping. If this keeps up, the pistons are going to melt. Wow! Fifty-nine minutes and 58 seconds! Brake, Zhendong. Lin is the first one to ever finish the race under an hour! He could not have stepped on the brakes any later! He has really pushed it to the limits this time! This is absolutely amazing! SUN YUQIANG - Yuqiang. - Huh? How far behind am I? The pressure of the brake oil is so high right now. Might have bumped somewhere. You can't go on full speed any more. You have to give yourself enough brake distance. Do I still have a chance? - You're behind by-- - You got to stop hitting the gas now. I know what I'm doing. Just let me-- Why do you have to win this time? I didn't think about winning. I just don't want to lose. And he's crossed the finish line! He won! He won! I cannot believe it! He just won!
