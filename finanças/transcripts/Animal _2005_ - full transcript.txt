[RAPPING] Sometimes your boys ain't your boys, right? Tell me about your son. [RAPPING] Sometimes your boys ain't your boys, right? Sometimes your boys ain't your boys, right? Wilson! Richardson! Allen! Yo. Carl? ANIMAL: Berwell, don't you get any real mail? From who? Your people. Nope. I gave that up a long time ago. My son, he hooks me up every month. Come on, James. Come on, man. Damn. You got kids, man? Nope. So tell me, on the real, what you in here for? Did you read that book I gave you? I'm reading it, man. You know he was a pimp? I like that part. Mm-hm. Love. But, you know, what you in here for? [SIGHS] They convicted me of murder. Oh. Oh, they convicted you of it. Oh, you're trying to say you innocent like all the rest of us? No, I killed people. In Vietnam, the enemy at home. I'm here, James, because the government did not care for my politics. We scared a lot of people with the stuff that we're running down, man. What kind of stuff are you running down? Liberation. Liberation? Mm-hm. Too bad your revolution ain't jump off. Oh, it jumped off, but it got sold out to drugs and money. Yeah. See? Yeah, see. Now that's what I'm talking about. My nigga-- I mean Negro. Yeah, OK. ANIMAL: See that's what I'm talking about. Now, it's good fighting for the cause and all that, but look where it got you. Yeah, but if we didn't do what we did, you wouldn't have any choices, James. Ain't everybody got them choices. BERWELL: Oh, yes they do. Some of them just got tricked. By Willie? BERWELL: Yeah, that's right. By Willie, man. You've got to smarten up, James. You know, stupid is a choice too. [MUSIC PLAYING] [RAPPING] Sometimes your boys ain't your boys, right? OK. Listen up. Sometimes your boys ain't your boys, right? Yeah, nigga. That's true. For reasons like that, there's things you do. When he talk, you listen up, for real, because I know my niggas that would chill, kill, and steal. Those new cats playing video games, casing your spot. Get high. Take your money, get your stomach in knots. Niggas that talk too much, most likely cowards. Type to watch you get stabbed up, then send you some flowers. Tell your family they was right by your side. But there's no evidence, no battle scars-- ANIMAL: Yo, Berwell. BERWELL: Yeah? I finished. How was it? Man, it was all right. Just all right? Can I tell you something, man? Yeah. It's the first book I ever read. You know, that's why it took me so long. I appreciate you telling me that, James. ANIMAL: I read Malcolm. Now, who's Willie? All right, I'm gonna tell you about Willie. The first thing I want to do is put this chair over here close to you. He was a slave owner in the West Indies. So? BERWELL: So I got these papers, and I call them the Willie Lynch papers. It's powerful stuff, man. The term lynching, they got it from his name. Say he was a master of keeping slaves in line, so American slave owners asked him to share his secret. In Virginia, 300 years ago, he gave this speech. He says, I have a foolproof method for controlling your slaves. I use fear, distrust, and envy for control purposes. He says, distrust is stronger than trust, and envy is stronger than adulation, respect, or admiration. You must pitch the old black male against a young black male, and the young black male against the old black male. You must use the female against the male, and you must use the male against the female. You must use a dark skinned slave against a light skinned slave. It is necessary that your slaves love, respect, and trust only us. Says, the black slave, after receiving this indoctrination, shall carry on for hundreds of years, maybe thousands. That's just some of it, James. I'm gonna give this to you, and I'm gonna let you read it. Wait, wait, man. This is real? Don't matter if it's real, James. It matters if it's true. You are a part of his indoctrination. It goes from generation to generation, from father to son. ANIMAL: Yeah, but that shit ain't right. You know, what the fuck am I supposed to do now? Ain't no body never spent no time with me, man. Nobody teach me nothing, man, just the streets. You have an opportunity to change your life. And when you change your life, you will affect many other lives. James, you have an opportunity. I can't change. BERWELL: You have an opportunity, my brother. No, my son. It's not complicated. You got to care about people, man. I care about you, James. I get it. [CRYING] [MUSIC PLAYING] James Allen. I'm Paul Wilson of the district attorney's office. You were convicted of attempted murder and armed robbery. ANIMAL: I told y'all I ain't do that. Yes, well we're inclined to believe you. Several of the officers involved in your conviction were recently charged with tampering with evidence. In short, Mr. Allen, you may be released in some months rather than some years. This will bring you up to speed. If you have any questions, the warden has been instructed to allow you the use of the phone to call my office. Congratulations. Guard. Guard? Yo, what's happening? Berwell, can I come in, man? Hey, James. Good to see you, man. ANIMAL: Hey, brother. I got some great news. Peep that. Great news. Uh-oh. Wow. Congratulations, big guy. Yo, man. BERWELL: That's really nice. I'm happy for you. ANIMAL: Looks like I'm gonna get out of here, man. I'm gonna be going back to my same hood. BERWELL: Come on, man. You worried about that? ANIMAL: Yo, on the real, the only place I ever been in my life is the hood and jail, and there ain't that much difference. OK, so is Willie Lynch thing. I go back in the same environment. BERWELL: Yeah, but you got it in your soul, man. Just take what you got in your soul. Yeah, right. That fear is natural. ANIMAL: I don't know if I can, uh-- INMATE: Yo, Animal. You owe Kassada. BERWELL: Hold up, hold up. You can't come in here. INMATE: Berwell, this has got nothing to do with you. BERWELL: Kassada and I made a deal, man. INMATE: Kassada's changing the rules. Fuck Kassada. Let me get there! [GROANS] Mother fuckers! Medic! James. Medic! Break the chain, James. Break the chain. [GROANING] [SCRAPING] BERWELL [VOICEOVER]: You see these papers? These are the Willie Lynch papers. In Virginia, 300 years ago, he gave this speech. I'm gonna give this to you, and I'm gonna let you read it. My method is simple. You must pitch the old black male against the young black male, and the young black male against the old black male. You must use a dark skinned slave against a light skinned slight. Use fear, distrust, and envy for control purposes. This indoctrination shall carry on for hundreds of years. You have an opportunity to change your life. Freeze. [MUSIC PLAYING] [RAPPING] You keep on calling me back. You keep on calling me. The streets keep on calling me back. There ain't no problem with that though. Rap's another means of cash flow. That's where I started my hustle. Pockets full of dollars, waistline. You taught me to keep it moving. That makes it harder to touch you. That's why I stay loving you. You calling me back. I stay loving you. Oh, man. I'm scared. Nah, not you. They still got bars up everywhere, huh? CREEPER: Yeah. Shit ain't changed. Maybe you changed. ANIMAL: Creep, you know that girl you hooked me up with? Ramona? She straight. CREEPER: Yeah. I done knew that. I've got something else to tell you. Yeah? ANIMAL: Yeah. It's really important. Got a little James running around. CREEPER: Shit. Just between you and me. You ready? Let's go. [LAUGHING] Yeah! [CHEERING] How you been, son? Damn, man. I'm doing great.

I've been blessed, you know, handling my little business. But you know, if you want, there's a lot more out there. What? Well, my man Jeff over at Grim Reaper Records, he says he's always in the market for somebody with your talents. Do what? Security. Stuff like that. [CAMERA SHUTTER] ANIMAL: Yeah? Yeah.

You got anything lined up? Nothing yet. A couple of leads. I need to see a pay stub by the end of the month. Now, I know there's a tendency for new releases to track down their old crew, you know, just to hang around with the guys. I understand that. But let me warn you, if you're involved in any type of illegal activity, and I mean anything, you got two strikes already. One more, and you're long gone. You're doing life. Understood, Animal? The name is James. I left Animal inside. Good. Under the terms of your parole, you're subject to random searches, either by myself or any of my assigns. Understand? Yes. Good, because drug tests are also random and weekly. Fill this up. CUSTOMER: I'm here to see-- - Hey. Hold up, man. I don't know this nigga. FRIEND: Oh, he cool. He cool.

What you gonna do about this, man? True what I hear about Darius? Darius is into it thick, thick as we were, maybe thicker. He got a crew? Oh, he's built one hell of a crew. What about the OGs? We are the OGs. Everybody else is either dead or in jail. Darius, he can handle his business. Like I handled mine. What happened to you in there? You got that look about you, man, like none of this matters no more. The hood never changes. After all these years, man. I don't know why I just can't give this shit up. Why can't we just give it up, Creep? Don't tell Darius about this. Excuse me. WORKER: You looking for a job? James, garbage. - Yeah. One minute. See y'all tomorrow. Man. [CAR HORN HONKING] Yo, man. Give me a turkey sandwich. Get your own damn turkey sandwich. Hop in. Take a ride. No, man. I've been here since 5:00 AM. I'm tired. I want to get home. 40 minutes, man. I got a surprise for you. Yeah. Hurry up. [MUSIC PLAYING] What's up, brother? - What's up Double T? - You all right? - Yeah. - Hey. Why don't y'all come on out here? CREEPER: The sexy Shae, and miss curious Kris, and the delectable Veneda. DOUBLE T: So what you think? Of what? About our little set up here, man. We plan on taking this worldwide. Major events, Super Bowl, All-Star Weekend, Vegas, baby. Yo, nigga. Please, man. Y'all ain't no kind of pimps. We got this thing worked out, but we need a little muscle to help kind of smooth things out. You know? Got to make the girls feel safer. You down? Man, I got a job. I got to show my PO a legit pay stub every two weeks. Come on, man. We're talking about making some real money, man. I'll take care of that parole shit. We need you. Can't do it. I got to get back home, OK? You going to give me a lift or what? I got to go to the east side later. Man, you might as well move on up to the east side if it's all like that. - Yo. I'll peep you later. DOUBLE T: All right, man. It's like that, huh? [MUSIC PLAYING] LATREESE: You seen your father? I've got us dinner in the oven. Did you take him to his parole officer? DARIUS: No, one of his partners took him a couple days ago. Well he got him there on time, right? He just got out. Why don't you just lay off him a little bit? Yo, grandma, why are you always trying to play my father like he's some type of loser or something? Because your father wasted his whole life. He was either running the streets or sitting in jail. Now he's too old to go forward, too old to go back. He's got this one chance to turn himself around. The next time he goes to prison, he ain't coming out. And you heading down that same road. Your mama tried to change things when-- now just look at you. DARIUS: Big papa. Who's your papa? What's up, D? Hey. Grandma, she-- she left you some dinner in the oven if you're hungry. No, man. I'm too tired to eat. DARIUS: Yeah. I feel you. Hey. You got a minute? Maybe I can holler at you about something? Sure. You know them cats from dice, right? ANIMAL: Yeah. Well they've been over there selling wolf tickets in the park, you know, like they trying to take this shit to a whole other level. You know what I mean? Ain't nobody tougher than me. Bingo. Bingo. Tough got me in jail almost half my life, most of yours. - Yeah. - Tough ain't shit, son. It's about being smart. You got to be smart. See, that's what I'm talking about. What I'm thinking is if you and Creeper and Double T, if y'all link in with my boys, man-- No, no no. --this shit would be bananas, pops. No, D. That ain't smart. That's tough, and tough will get you killed for nothing. Smart is about making a choice. OK. You lost me right there. Peep this. I can whip up on any white man, but who's got the money? Who's got the power? - Yeah. Who put your ass in jail? I put my black ass in jail. Yeah. It's called the Willie Lynch Syndrome. Willie Lynch was a slave owner 300 years ago. He wrote some letters that said niggas gonna kill niggas. OK. I didn't trust you over there because you a dice, you a crip, you a blood. You east side. You west side. You light skinned. I'm dark skinned. Divide and conquer. Fuck. This shit sound like some jailhouse preacher shit right here. - No. This ain't no Bible bullshit. DARIUS: Yes, that is, man. No, that's the truth. No. The truth is the streets, man. The truth is what you taught me. In all reality, you ain't even been in the streets in like 20 years. And if you don't get your shit tight, if you don't get your shit right, man, you're gonna be dead in these streets, man. Yeah. You're going to tell me about dying? Nigga, I-- everybody I talk to, man, they got mad respect for you but they say one thing. You ain't never been good for nothing but killing niggas. And now you saying you ain't even good at that shit no more. I've been waiting for my father to show up for 20 goddamn years, and you the fuck showed up. All due respect, man, it sounds like a whole lot of shit you talking. [DOOR CLOSING] Morning, pop. - Yeah. Good morning, son. Hey, about all that stuff I was mouthing off with last night, you know, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. We cool. You know, I've been thinking that-- I don't know how you feel about it and all, but if grandma been riding you the way she's been riding me, maybe you and I should just get our own little spot. You know? What about Grandma? I think she'd be cool. It's not like we ain't gonna see her no more. We just ain't going to be living here. Yeah, but you know when I was locked down, she gave a lot of time to you. I can't leave her here alone. I owe her. It just seems liked everybody else come first. You know? I'm sorry you feel that way. And you're right. Let me just get my bearings straight, then we need to talk. It's cool, but I got time now. The Willie Lynch letter. Hey. Good morning, mama. LATREESE: Morning, baby. Made you some coffee. - You did? - Mm-hm. Good. ANIMAL: Two sugars? That's right. You remembered. Hey. What's up, baby? RAMONA: What's up, baby? How's he doing? Better. How you doing? My beautiful queen. You hungry? ANIMAL: No. What? Darius. You still haven't told him about us? You got to let him know that this is his home too now. Sweetie, it's not that easy. I'm trying to connect with him. I'm trying to find a way to be his father, and I think I lost him. [KNOCKING ON DOOR] Pop? Hey, pop. Nigga don't ever come home now. What are you doing, man? I'm working. How did you find me? You know I got eyes all over the neighborhood. Where you been, man? You ain't even been home. Well, a man needs a little loving, son. Yeah, but you know, you being all over here working like this, man, you got me looking real bad. You actually slopping chicken and the whole nine. Yeah. If I do anything crooked, my PO will be up my ass. Yeah, see, but nobody talking about you doing nothing crooked. I told you about my boy, Jeff. He got a straight up job for you, man. Security doing a little music video. $200 straight up. $200? Yeah, man. Cash. What time you get off? About 5:00. OK. I'll be here to pick you up, man. $200? $200 cash. Bring some chicken home though. That's funny. Damn. This is strange, man. [MUSIC PLAYING] WORKER [ON RADIO]: I need a 20 on Spyda. Yeah. He's in his trailer. Yo, pops. Hey. What's up, son? Did I hook you up or what? Yeah. You hooked me up, thanks. Man. You know I got you a little something too. See, you doing the security thing, you need you a little back up. No. That's OK. I don't need this. You've got it like that, huh? I can be smart or tough. I'm gonna be smart. WORKER [ON RADIO]: Spyda on set in 10 minutes. All right. I'll be one minute. Talk to you later. Stop! No! No. Stop! Stop. ANIMAL: What's going on? Nothing, mother fucker. Step off. ANIMAL: She said no. SPYDA: And I said step off. Matter of fact, take this Benji, go run and tell Jeff you did your job. Put your dress on. Man, she ain't putting nothing on but a rubber on my dick. Now get the fuck out of here before you make the news. Go ahead. Maybe you'd be doing me a favor. Nigga, you crazy. You know what? Get the fuck out of here. Take this sorry-ass hoe with you. Come on. Go ahead. [CRYING] ANIMAL: Take her to her trailer. Pop, you can't let no nigga just put a gun in your face like that. D, I got two strikes against me. Now I'm going to kill this fool for disrespecting me and go to prison for life? Look, pop. I know you're trying to change and all that, but you're still in the mother fucking streets and there's rules to this shit. Let it go. Yeah. Just walk away from your manhood. Yo, Spyda. Come in. What you getting coked up, nigga? I'm trying to get right with that, man. DARIUS: Yeah, I saw that. Fucking hip hop cop. DARIUS: I wish you would have pulled that shit on me, nigga. [GUNSHOT] [MUSIC PLAYING] Yo. What up, man? Dude. I got to change clothes. What happened? You'll never believe this shit. Your boy, Spyda, happened, man. I'm sitting there and Spyda come out of his trailer demonstrating, real raw. You know what I mean? And I'm waiting, man. I'm sitting there waiting for my pops to say something or do something. The nigga stood there like a little bitch. I tried to offer him my piece earlier. Mother fucker wouldn't even take it, man. He been acting strange. Your dad's got a lot going on, man. Yeah, well shit. He ain't got me going on. I'm supposed to be his mother fucking son. That nigga don't even fucking come home, you know? Fuck. Look. Got me all emotional like a little bitch or something. I need to find that mother fucker, man. I'll get this shit back to you, all right? Forget I talked about it. Yo, man. Close the door. [MUSIC PLAYING] DOUBLE T: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Oh. Oh. Oh. Hey. What up, D? Hey. Where my pops at? Well he ain't here. Man, tell the little nigga where his pops is, man. You're fucking up my dance. He'll tell you when he's ready. Shit, Creeper. If you know where he at, man, I can't put this shit off no more. DOUBLE T: Man, tell him where his pops is, man. He's on the east side, D. Ain't you got a big mouth? Where on the east side? ANIMAL: He still got a fever? A little, but it's breaking though. You look kind of tired. You coming down with something? No, I'm fine. If we could get out of here, baby, and go someplace else, would you? Go where? I don't know, just someplace else. Can we do that? I mean with your parole and everything? I think so, just as long as we stay in the state. Why you want to leave? Because I, uh-- I can't figure out a way to make it right with Darius and me. Look, baby. You ain't never going to get past that if you don't stay and try. [DOORBELL RINGS] Can't keep running. Who is it? DARIUS: Is Anim-- is James Allen there? What are you doing here? Who is this? Ramona, Darius. Darius, Ramona. Nice to finally meet you. What's up with you, man? Can we talk in private? I'm going to go check on James Jr. I'll give you two some privacy. We'll talk outside. Let's talk over here. You killed Spyda, didn't you? You killed another black man, D. He had a girl in his trailer who saw him point a gun at me. Now when that gets out to 5-0, 5-0 is going to come looking for me. I'm on probation. I've got two strikes against me, and you bring this shit to my home around my son. Is that smart or tough, D? What the fuck is up with you? You used to be a legend, man. You used to be Animal. I used to be a slave. All I did was kill people who looked like me. You know why the hood will never change? Because anyone who can change the hood, we kill them. Me and niggas like you, we kill them. My generation did it, and your generation did it. It's that Willie Lynch shit. And now we got to build. We got to come together and we got to build. We got to build? ANIMAL: Build. Nigga, it look like you building pretty fine on your own. Got a nice little bitch and a nice little apartment. You got a little nigga-- Don't fucking disrespect me. You got a little nigga up in the house. Nigga, what the fuck about me? ANIMAL: I know I fucked up my life, but you still have a chance, D. You're young, and your baby brother has a chance. I don't even know that nigga, man. And you ain't had no problem bringing all this shit around me when I was growing up. But now-- oh, I'm sorry. Now you mister good man. You're mister good dad. What do you want? Huh? That's the past, D. What do you want from me? Fuck you, man. I don't want shit from you. Because when I needed you, nigga, you weren't there. Nigga, I've been on my own since I was 12 years old. And now after all that shit, you ain't got no love for me? I ain't got no fucking love for you. And you know why I ain't got no love for you? Because I don't know how to love. Because I ain't got no love for myself. Now I'm trying to raise your little baby brother. You keep this shit away from him. You ain't got no love for me? This is all I've got to give to you. I ain't got no love for you either. [GUNSHOT] Shit. ANIMAL: It's OK, D. It's all right. Pop. I'm sorry, Pop. You should've talked to me, nigga. That's all I got to give you. Look, pop. We're gonna just-- ANIMAL: It's OK. This shit ain't OK. Nigga, it ain't OK. ANIMAL: OK. Come on. It's OK. DARIUS: I just want to talk to you, nigga. I just want-- Run, D. You just run. [CRYING] Come on, run. Run. [SIREN IN THE DISTANCE] [COUGHING] [THUNDER] [SOBBING] [MUSIC PLAYING] [SINGING] Motherless children have a hard time. And I'm confused, whoa, in my bones. And passion flows like a river of fire. And when I'm down, when I'm down, I feel I'm finally alone. You are there to take me higher. Take me higher. Now, mama. I need you. Oh, Lord. Now I need you. DARIUS: Ramona! Ramona! Ramona. Sorry I was late. - Oh, no. That's OK. Thanks so much for doing this. OK? Yeah. No problem. I think I've really got a shot at this job. Well hit it. I got it. RAMONA: OK. What's up, man? Wait. What? Some kids at his school, they've been talking about how bad his father was and he's been asking a lot of questions. Can you talk to him please? I'll talk to him. Thanks. OK, baby. Bye. Bye. Hey, kill them over there, all right? DARIUS: I will. Hey, come on. Take a walk with me. You know your father loved you a lot with all his heart? He did the best he could, you know, to be the best type of man he could with what he had. And when he died, he wanted nothing more than for you to have a better life than him. He actually had these letters, a story about a man named Willie Lynch, who was a slave owner, you know? And he set up this entire way of dealing with people, of how to run black people-- [MUSIC PLAYING] [SINGING] All the youngsters around the world who may be feeling what I feel. Like there's no way out. But if you just believe, then you're not alone. Walking down the streets on the avenue. It's been a long, cold winter and I'm feeling blue. In my belly there's a hunger for something more than holes in my shoes. More than holes in my shoes. Everybody's in a hurry to get to nowhere. A young child is crying. Her mother don't care. No milk in the bottle, but she gets welfare for food. Welfare for food. The world keep turning but the fire's burning out. I guess I'll take another trip down to the rock house. The only place I go where everybody knows my name. They know my name. You know I feel so high when I'm in bliss. I would sell my soul for just one more hit. I'll do anything to escape this pain. Oh yeah. [MUSIC - WYCLEF JEAN, "PRESIDENT"] [SINGING] Election time's coming. Who you gonna vote for? Yeah. If I was president, I'd get elected on Friday, assassinated on Saturday, buried on Sunday. They go back to work on Monday. If I was president. If I was president. If I was president, yeah. Instead of spending billions on the war, I can use that money so I can feed the poor. 'Cause I know some so poor, when it rains, that's when the shower. Screaming, fight the power. That's when the vulture devoured. If I was president, I'd get elected on Friday, assassinated on Saturday, buried on Sunday. They go back to work on Monday. If I was president. If I was president. If I was president. Yeah. I know some soldiers that sleep, but they can't dream. Wake up with screams, sounds of M-16s. So take this medal of honor for your bravery. I wish you the best, kid. You and your family. If I was president, I'd get elected on Friday, assassinated on Saturday, buried on Sunday. They go back to work on Monday. If I was president. If I was president. If I was president. But the radio won't play this. They call it rebel music. How can you refuse it, children of Moses? Tell the children the truth, the truth. It's not all that bling. That's diamonds. Tell them the truth, the truth. Most of y'all wear cubic zirconium. Tell them the truth, the truth. Yeah. Your soul is worth more than diamonds and gold. If I was president, all blacks will have reparation, no segregation. Feed the nation 'til there's no famine. Muslims, Jews, Christians would all hold hands. Every week on the beach, party by the sane. Word up. Take trips on Air Force One. No need to bring the homeless with no sneaks to Air Force One. Better schools in the hood, better teachers for the classes. Making money, paying no taxes. Find the best scientists. Tell them, come up with the answer. I want the cure for AIDS and cancer. But I gotta watch my back. Snipers on the hill with the steel.
