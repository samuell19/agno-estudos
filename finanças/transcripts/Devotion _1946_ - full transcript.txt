Miss Branwell's package, Ted. Here we are, Miss Branwell. I think you'll find these will keep the young ladies warm for the journey. This is Miss Anne's and Miss Charlotte's. Miss Emily I understand will be with us yet awhile. Yes, Mr Ames. Miss Emily will remain at home. Good day, Miss Branwell. The Vicar's girls going into service. What is the world coming to. Good day, Lady Thornton. This is indeed a pleasure. Good day, Miss Branwell. Will you tell Miss Charlotte I received her letter. And I am glad to accede to her most unusual request. Charles, give Miss Branwell the parcel. No doubt, your niece intends to employ it for some admirable domestic purpose. But .. I think there must be some mistake, Lady Thornton. There is no mistake, Miss Branwell. Miss Charlotte writes with a clear, bold hand. A very bold hand, I may say. Good day, Miss Branwell. To the Poorhouse, Charles. Charlotte. Charlotte. Emily .. Anne. Charlotte! Branwell! Emily, Charlotte, Anne! - Elisabeth. I am endeavouring to compose a sermon on the virtues of silence. And I am endeavouring to retain my composure. Oh, that shameless girl! May I ask what you are talking about? - Brown wrapping-paper! The humiliation of it. Tabby, where are the children? Out yonder, I reckon. Up on the moor. Yes. And the gooseberries uncleaned and the potatoes unpeeled, I have no doubt. Your children, Mr Bront?. - Oh, yes. They are always my children when they incur your displeasure I notice. But when you've reason to approve their conduct, it is your brilliant nephew. Your talented nieces. Such occasions are rare indeed, Mr Bront?. Oh Branwell, please. Put me down. Let me go, Branwell, let me go. So your brother cannot paint nor write. You still of that opinion sister Anne? - I never said that. I said it's not your place to announce your genius at the top of your lungs. I think I know my place, Anne. And you very shortly, are going to know yours. Emily! Charlotte! Branwell, put me down! Branwell, please. In the middle of the stream Anne, is a deep pool. At the bottom of the pool there dwells a large eel. Emily! Charlotte! It is my intention to drop you in that pool. Let me go, Branwell or I shall drown. Drowning was good enough for Shelley and he was a better poet than you are, Anne. Very well, drown me. Branwell! Really, your sense of humour is becoming more warped every day. Put her down, you great bully. Certainly, Charlotte. Branwell, you beast! Branwell! You have a very pretty nose, Anne. Very pretty. And completely devoid of character. She has a great deal more character than you have, Branwell. If you think that taking positions as governesses .. To keep the wolf from the Bront? door denotes character or even intelligence. How you enjoy misinterpreting our sentiments, Branwell. Anne and I have quite other reasons for seeking employment. Have we not, Anne? Yes, we're doing it .. - We wish to see life. Why? So that we may write of what we see. Oh, you sicken me with your idealistic prattlings. Come down from your complacent cloud, Charlotte. Come down and find Emily and I have more talent in our little fingers .. Than ever will exist in your busy, noble brain. This is our last day at home. Please don't spoil it. Amid the world's wide din around. I hear from far a solemn sound that says .. Remember me. And solemn as a funeral knell. I hear that soft voice so, so well. Cry, oh remember me. Do you want to see the world, Emily? Or are you content to stay at home and rot with me? This is my world. Aren't we going on with the painting, Branwell? No, I'm not in the mood. Don't be foolish, Emily. You know by now that Branwell is never in the mood to finish what he has begun. You see, Emily? Already she has started to talk like a governess. Just wait until you've been one for a few months. Then we shall see whether you are so anxious to finish what you've begun. Branwell. Do you know why Charlotte and Anne are undertaking their unpleasant occupation? I've already explained our reasons to Branwell, Emily. What dark mystery is this? What are you hiding from me? - Nobody is hiding anything. All your schoolgirl secrets bore me. I'm off to The Bull. Emily, take my things home will you. - No, Branwell. You take your own things home with you. I'll bring them. Good old Emily. I sometimes wonder if you really understand him. The trouble is Charlotte, I think I understand him only too well. For what we are about to receive may The Lord make us truly thankful. Amen. Am I to understand Charlotte you've been asking charity at Thornton Hall? Oh, has it come? Yes, the reward of your shame is there, Charlotte. Thrown at me for all the parish to see. - Yes, there it is. You may each take a quarter. - I take a third. And I take it now. - Emily! You pirate! I need some of this for Stone Gap. I mean to lead a very full life. The recording of which, will require a great deal of paper. And in the peace which will inevitable follow your departure. I intend to write a history of stupendous length. So. - Be seated! I trust you'll overlook Emily's unseemly conduct, Papa. Charlotte! It is your conduct that concerns me chiefly at the moment, Charlotte. The prohibitive cost of paper .. Prevents us buying the books we need for our "scribblings" as you call them. But wrapping-paper, when ironed and cleaned makes for reasonable manuscript. You have a certain crafty logic, Charlotte. That is high praise from you, Papa. - Oh, you artful hyena. Where is Branwell? He stopped in the village to collect the letters, Papa. The London coach must have been and gone at least an hour ago. Nothing of the sort. The coach is frequently late. I should have liked all my family around the table on your last evening. Oh, Papa, you talk as if we're to be gone a year. We shall be back by Christmas. And you are not to work too hard while we're gone, Papa. No. Emily, see to it that the new curate .. I have not forgotten Miss, your forwardness in writing to the Bishop. For once, Charlotte has made good sense. You cannot work as you have been doing. And hope to preserve your health. I explained to the bishop that the growing parish of Haworth .. Was too great a burden for one man to bear. Really, Charlotte. The extent and nature of your correspondence staggers me. Besides, I do not like curates. Their sickly faces depress me intolerably. And where is Branwell? One thing is sure. Another year in this place will be the ruin of his genius. Aunt is willing to advance us some money which we will repay from our salaries. That way, Branwell can stay in London to gain his diploma from the Royal Academy. No sacrifice that enabled Branwell to develop his talents would be in vain. That's what I feel, Anne. There's no reason why he shouldn't leave with us tomorrow. We could all travel as far as Keighley together. Yes. To get him safely past The Bull. That is most important. Don't you think so, Emily? I don't like the plan any more than he will appreciate the sacrifice you make. Very well. We once decided no important decision will be made unless we all agreed to it. That being the case, Branwell shall not go to London. All the same, Emily. I think you're behaving abominably. Emily. Don't you want to help Branwell? Yes, it was foolish of me to say that. I know how fond you are of Branwell. But I really cannot understand your attitude, Emily. Neither can Anne. No Emily, I'm afraid I care not. I do not wish Branwell to go to London because he isn't ready for it. I think it would kill him. What nonsense. Branwell isn't a child. I'm not going to argue with you, Charlotte. Don't be angry with me, Charlotte. Goodnight, dear Anne. - Goodnight, dear Emily. Don't say goodnight to her. I'm sorry Charlotte but I've already said it. Boss. I gave you an order a good ten minutes ago. Aye Master Branwell. You ordered three drinks and danged if I know which to serve first. Ungrateful wretch. That's all the thanks I get for filling his pub every evening. Well, here you are. You don't think I look like that Master Branwell, do you? Yes, I'm afraid I do. However since you're dissatisfied, I'll let you off my usual fee. Boss, where's that brandy I ordered?- Here is brandy, but where is money? Charge it to my account. - But you've got no account here. I should hope not. My account is with posterity. No, Master Branwell, this very morning, your good Aunt .. I thank you sir, not to bandy a lady's name about the temple. Now my good sir, it's your urn to be immortalized. I can't make a good job of it unless you sit still you know. There! My best work this evening and it is only going to cost you one glass of brandy. You lucky man. You cannot make a face with three strokes. I can. Now, pay up my dear fellow. As sure as that mug standing there. I said nowt about no glass of brandy. What mug? Alright, coachman. Thank you, sir. Hey, that will cost you a pretty penny, Master Branwell. You alright? Nobody hurt, I trust? The horse was shied, that's all. Some fool threw a mug through the window. It is I sir, to whom you happen to be referring. Thank you. I didn't ask which fool. I should like a room for the night. - Aye, sir. Upstairs, sir. Thank you. Well, perish my eyes. It is the new curate. That's right. Do you hear that, my lads? Your new curate. Welcome to Haworth. My name is Arthur Nicholls. You have the honour, sir of addressing your Vicar's son. Branwell Bront?. Oh. And now, what shall it be? - For me? A bed. And you shall have it my dear fellow. Come along to the vicarage. No thank you. I think I had better present myself to your father in the morning. Oh. As you please. Perhaps I may go as far as the door with you? You know. My father detests curates. My sisters are man-haters. And I drink. So you shall be very happy here, Mr Nicholls. Can't you sleep, Charlotte? - I've had such terrible dreams, Emily. Because I wouldn't say goodnight to you, I expect. Oh, Charlotte. - Forgive me. Oh, Emily. You and I must never drift apart. That is so important. Yes, Charlotte. People will always quarrel over Branwell. And Branwell will always like it. It would be so dreadful if we were happy and he wasn't. That's why I want him to go, Emily. I realize in London, he'd be with all the temptations but I thought .. Well, let him. How else can he become a man? I believe you've shared my thought, Emily. Oh I do, Charlotte, but don't you see. London is not the dream city of his imagination. His disillusion would be unbearable to witness. If you were to spare him disillusion .. It is you who will destroy Branwell, not I. No. Neither of us will destroy him. He .. He shall go, Charlotte. Oh thank you, Emily. I knew you'd see reason. Now I'm not so unkind .. As man's ingratitude. Blow, blow .. - Shush. This is my home. It seems your family has retired. Oh yes. They are very retiring here. What's the use of a doorknob on a cottage? Ah .. the faithful Emily. Come in my dear friend, come in. I think in his present condition he .. - Take care of your own condition. That's right. Things are difficult enough, Branwell. Without you bringing your drunken friends home with you. Come on. So Charlotte and Anne have decided to make the supreme sacrifice. Very touching. But unfortunately quite wasted. It is something that time alone will tell, Branwell. Not at all. I shall anticipate time by informing you that I am not going to London. I'm much too ill. I think in fact I'm going to die. Now listen to me, Branwell. In half an hour you'll be at breakfast. Washed and in good order. You will thank your sisters for their generous gesture. You will inform your doting father that you have confidence in the future. You will in fact, play the great hero on the eve of battle. A role well within your range, I imagine. Emily. Have you no faith in me at all? At least, I shall never cease to love you, Branwell. Goodbye, Papa. - Goodbye my dear. Now remember. If everything isn't to your liking, pack up and come home. Say goodbye to your sister and be off. We haven't lost our beloved Emily yet. She's coming with us as far as the moor. Well, auntie. I'll be back before long as the Royal Portrait painter or the Poet Laureate. Take your choice. You'll be back as a corpse if you don't wear my mufflers in those London fogs. God be with you, you bad lad. Goodbye, father. - God bless you, my son. You know what I expect of you. Goodbye. - Goodbye, Tabby. Goodbye, auntie. Goodbye. Come on Keeper, come on, come on. No long speeches. Goodbye my dear Charlotte. Goodbye dearest. Do write .. everything. And think of us Emily, dear. - Goodbye, dear Anne. Goodbye, Emily. Look after yourself, Branwell. I shall expect to see you at my first exhibition. I'll be there, Branwell. See that the new curate does his job. Yes .. yes. Alright, Keeper. I'll race you. But you must give me a start now. Now stay. Stay. Now! [ Door knocks ] Come in. If you please sir .. Mr Nicholls. Nicholls? - The new curate, sir. Oh yes. Ask him to come in. And tell Miss Emily I wish to see her when she returns. How do you do, Mr Nicholls. - How do you do, sir. I hope I find you well. Of course I am well. Does that surprise you? No doubt, the Bishop acting on information received from my daughter. Has pictured me a helpless invalid with one foot in the grave. Why no, not at all. Well that sir, is not the case. And let me assure you. You are here neither at my wish nor my request. It was my daughter Charlotte who took the liberty of writing to His Lordship. I hope I shall give you no cause to regret her action. I hope not. Well. You look a strong, healthy specimen. Which is certainly more than I expected. Sit down. Now. I understand from his Lordship, you were educated abroad. Well, I shall not hold that against you .. but remember. No fancy foreign airs here. We have some pretty rough customers in this parish. Who are not to be charmed into a state of grace. Would you care for a pipe? Am I being tested, sir? I've no use for a man without a vice. A small one preferably. It supports his character. - Thank you, sir. And I dare say the large vices support the church, don't they? Very good, Mr Nicholls. I am happy to find you possessed of a sense of humour. Ah, Emily. Did they get off alright? - Yes, Papa. This is Mr Nicholls who's come to assist me in the care of the parish. My daughter, Emily. - Why, how do you do? Good morning. You will stay to luncheon of course my dear Nicholls? Yes thank you, sir. Sorry you didn't arrive earlier. You'd have met my son. He left for London this morning to make his place in the world. I think you'd have got on with him. Do you think Mr Nicholls would've found much in common with Branwell, Emily? I'm sure he would, Papa. Would you take a glass of wine, Mr Nicholls? No thank you. I never touch it before sundown. You will be pleased to hear that the sun sets early in these parts, Mr Nicholls. Emily. I hope they looked after you well at The Bull last night, Mr Nicholls. Oh yes, thank you. The hospitality of The Bull left nothing to be desired. Yes. The Bull is noted for its hospitality. I'm sure you felt at home there immediately, Mr Nicholls. Not immediately, Miss Bront?. I was called on to take up my duties as a curate rather sooner than I expected. Oh, indeed? One of your parishioners, who had indulged rather freely. Seemed in sore need of an escort for his homeward journey. I hadn't the heart to refuse him. But it proved to be a very thankless task. Ruffians like that should be left to find their own way home. You can be sure, Mr Nicholls .. That your thoughtfulness was appreciated. This is where Charlotte and I used to come when we were children. To see who could pick the most blackberries for Tabby's pies. Poor Charlotte. She must be absolutely wretched at Stone Gap. Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sure I talk far too much about my family. No. I like to hear you talk about them. It helps me to know you better. And that's a reward in itself. Thank you. Well, come along Mr Nicholls. Between us we haven't picked enough to make even one pie for poor old Tabby. I'm not really lazy you know. But so far I've seen very few blackberries to pick. I can't understand it. Last year was a very good season. Why don't we sit down and wait until next season? Oh, you'll never last until then. - Last? What I mean is .. no curate has ever stayed very long at Haworth. It's too quiet and dull here, even for .. Even for a curate? Well, Miss Emily. Here is one curate who is asking for nothing better .. Than to see many a season at Haworth. Provided, of course .. - What? That you promise to stay and see them with me. I promise. Well, back home to Tabby. Come on Keeper, come on boy. Where is Emily? She's assisting Mr Nicholls with the Sunday School class. Hmm. May I ask the significance of that grunt, Miss Branwell? Emily is full of good works these days. Is she not? You've never brought me this way before. I never bring anyone this way. Not even your brother and sisters? Oh no .. they don't like this part of the moor at all. They think it is ugly. It is a rather lonely place here I suppose but .. I don't mind that. Why should you? You belong here. You don't think it is ugly, do you, Mr Nicholls? There could never be anything ugly about your world, Miss Emily. But I do feel somewhat of a trespasser. Oh, no you're not. That's why I brought you here. Knowing you is a rare privilege. Thank you, Mr Nicholls. That's what I wanted to show you. Not quite what dreams are made of, is it. But it's been in mine ever since I can remember. A strange, awesome-looking place. It's the place I write about. And even though it is grey and storm-swept. And made for strange, unyielding people. The lovely things are all the lovelier. Who lives there? Ghosts. You don't really believe in ghosts, do you? Oh yes. Yes. I've both seen and heard them. They are in my dreams sometimes. It seems that I stand here, just at this spot. Watching that house in the silence of the night. And then, suddenly I .. I hear a sound that terrifies me. The beating of a horse's hooves coming nearer and nearer. And I turn and .. And here comes a great, black horse and a dark rider. And he thunders down on me. But I cannot move. What does he look like? I've never seen his face. For a minute, you had me believing your strange fancies. There, Mr Nicholls you see. When I'm with you, my dreadful nightmare is actually only one of our moor horses. Well, it's getting late. Shall we be on our way? Come on, then. What's the name of that place? I call it "Wuthering Heights". How happy you look, Emily. I think you must have anticipated my homecoming. Well, is there no greeting for the prodigal? Branwell .. what brings you home? It seems that London has treated Branwell shamefully. Yes, Emily. You might have acquainted yourself more with the ways of that loveless city. Before you threw me into its chill embrace. It is a city of Philistines. No success without influence. No admission without patronage. No patronage without toadying. You wanted this to happen, Emily. You and Charlotte and Anne. One more rival out of the way. It leaves a clearer field, doesn't it. Soon you'll find that three is a crowd. Then you'll cut each other's throats. I don't believe what I'm saying. Forgive me. What shall I do with him, Emily? What shall I do? It's no use looking to Emily. Her only concern is with Miss Emily Bront?. Thank God Charlotte will be home in a few days. She'll think of something. She always does. If there is a better ironed petticoat at Thornton Hall tonight .. Oh, it's really beautiful, Anne. Do you think I might wear it instead of my dress, Aunt? A high time to jest on such matters. Oh, on our first night at home it is permissible to jest about anything. What have you got in that mysterious box, Emily? Flowers for the fair, my dear. For Charlotte, for Anne. And for Emily. Oh, Emily. You think of everything. You've made them beautifully. This is my first happy day for months. I shall record the fact instantly in my diary. How many copybooks did you fill at Stone Gap? Six at least. But it would take a good dozen to properly describe that horrid household. Anne only managed to fill three. That is only because my penmanship is smaller. I was every bit as unhappy as Charlotte. I assure you. I think it's very shocking of you both to pry into the affairs of a family. It's wicked enough to tattle about your employers. But to record their shortcomings is the height of indecency. Prying into the lives of others is the art of a novelist, Aunt. Well, heaven be praised you are not novelists. No. We are not novelists .. yet. "The night is darkening round me." "The wild winds coldly blow." - Give me that, Charlotte! "But the pirates then found me and I cannot, cannot go." Charlotte! There is no need to get excited, Emily. I think it is a very beautiful poem. I don't care what you think of it. But please keep your fingers away from my work. I'm very sorry, Emily. But Charlotte has such a lovely plan, Emily. She thought we might all put our poems in one package and send them to London. "Poems by three sisters." Think what a stir it would cause if they were published. I would as soon think of publishing my poems as .. selling Keeper. Come, come girls, hurry. You are the strangest creatures. You have finally secured an invitation to Thornton House. And now you talk of nothing but poetry. You'll never get husbands that way. Your necklace, Emily. Charlotte .. remember you'll be among the fox-hunting set. No talk of poetry, please. And .. I hear that Dr Seaton's son has turned over a new leaf. And need no longer be avoided. Quite the contrary, in fact. If anyone should ask you to dance Emily, don't try to look pleased. Now come along, girls, hurry. And enjoy yourselves. Goodbye, Aunt. - Goodbye, Aunt. Good evening Mr Nicholls. What a pleasant surprise. Good evening. - Where is Branwell? Your brother wishes me to tell you that he will meet you in the village. He's asked me to escort you there. Well, that is very kind of you, Mr Nicholls. May I introduce you to my sisters. Anne. How do you do. - How do you do. And Charlotte. - How do you do. How do you do. Are we waiting for anything, Mr Nicholls? No, I beg your pardon. Are we not to meet Branwell at the Inn? I thought you might prefer to wait at a little distance. We have learned not to be over-sensitive, Mr Nicholls. So, if we are to meet our brother at the Inn, let us stop at the Inn. I'll fetch him. Hello! Here I am, right on time, you see. Oh such finery, such elegance. Branwell, get in. We're late. Give me the reins, Nicholls. We'll be there in no time at all. I think I will drive, Mr Bront?. Very well. Well, it we're to have a priest as pilot .. Why not a painter as postilion? Get off, you fool! I think that's what the horse is trying to say. There. There. There. I thought we would reach Thornton House rather earlier than expected. Oh, you were wonderful, Mr Nicholls. Thank you, Mr Nicholls. Now will you turn around and go back to the village. For what, Miss Bront?? - For Branwell. He may be hurt. A few bruises on that wild head won't come amiss. Be good enough to do as I say, Mr Nicholls. I'm afraid I must decline, Miss Bront?. Your brother is in no fit condition to squire you to Thornton House. I order you to return instantly! At this very moment, Branwell may be lying dead in the gutter. At this very moment, I don't care. We shall want the carriage at 11:30. As I shall be present at the ball, it can be arranged quite easily. Are we to have you as a chaperone this evening? I'm afraid so. - Good heavens. Miss Bront?, I believe. - Good evening, Lady Thornton. Home for the holidays? - No, I haven't been away. Good evening, Mr Nicholls. - How do you do. May I have the pleasure of a dance, Miss Bront?? I'm sorry, Mr Nicholls. But my program is full. May I have the pleasure of the next waltz, Miss Anne? Why yes, Mr Nicholls. Are you going to dance with me tonight, Miss Emily? As often as you like, Mr Nicholls. Well, everyone seems to be enjoying themselves. Those unhealthy girls from the vicarage haven't sat out a single dance. I only asked them to alleviate the bareness of the walls. Why do you call them unhealthy? They write poetry. They go for long walks. And the eldest one collects brown packing-paper, as a hobby. That one looks as though she may collect a husband before the evening is out. So you see, I've turned over an entirely new leaf. Oh, I know Mr Seaton. My Aunt says you are no longer to be avoided. Quite the contrary in fact. Really, Miss Anne. You do say the oddest things. Don't be angry with Charlotte, Mr Nicholls. She has a sharp tongue, but she doesn't mean what she says. You'll find that out when you get to know her better. The whole incident is already forgotten. Have you killed many foxes lately, Sir John? What? Are you glad to be home again, Miss Bront?? I'm not sure. Mr Nicholls, I find after all that I am disengaged for the next dance. You have my sympathy, Miss Bront?. I should like you to have the next dance with me, Mr Nicholls. With pleasure, Miss Bront?. Do not imagine my singular request is prompted by a desire to dance with you. In that case, we had better find somewhere where we can talk. Where shall we sit? Mr Nicholls. I have noticed, and I think many people here must have noticed. That you have paid very particular attention to my sister, Emily. In your absence Miss Bront?, your sister Emily and I have become good friends. I value that friendship, and I have every intention of preserving it. And I have every intention of protecting my sister .. From any humiliation to which her generous nature might lead her. It is useless to prolong this conversation. Shall we return? What I have to say will not take long. I have a plan for Emily. A dream very dear to both our hearts. Any obstacle standing in the way of its fulfilment I'll remove without scruple. Do I make myself clear? May I ask the nature of your plan? When I have saved sufficient money from my present duties. I am going to take Emily to Brussels. There are pensions there .. That offer an excellent education in exchange for the teaching of English. An admirable plan, Miss Bront?. Most practical. It surprises me that anything of such a prosaic nature should haunt your dreams. Is it prosaic to want to escape from this .. This rut in which we've spent all our lives? Is it ignoble to yearn for a bigger world? A world rich in material for the books we shall one day write. Miss Emily gives me the impression of being happy in her "rut" as you call it. And you? And I? You I fear, will take your rut with you. They are playing the music for the next dance. Shall we go in? With pleasure. I hope it is clear Mr Nicholls. You will dance no more with Emily this evening. On the contrary. I'm going to ask her for the next dance. Very well. You came to the vicarage at my request. And tomorrow you shall leave at it. There are ways of dealing with ladies of your perverse temperament, Miss Bront?. It is fortunate for you that I am not a woman-beater. Charlotte .. Charlotte. - What is it? Charlotte, please come. Well, Sir John. Are you still pursuing the dangerous sport of fox-hunting? Really, sir. Your humour is out of place. Oh, Sir John, don't take me so seriously. John! Lady Thornton! Haven't seen you at The Bull lately. Bull? Young man, I think you'd better leave. Lady Thornton, if you come along and show me where you've hidden the drinks. I might save the supper dance just for you. Mr Bront?, there will be neither dancing nor drinking for you here tonight. Come on, Branwell. Excuse me. Sorry old fellow, I'm .. - Going home. Before I've had a drink? - They're serving drinks on the terrace. Well, why didn't you say so? Goodbye, Lady Thornton. I'll be back. Good evening, Lady Thornton. It was very pleasant. Good evening, Lady Thornton. There's not a drink in sight as far as I can see. Never mind about that, now. - But I do mind. Come on, Branwell. You've had enough for one night. Stop mollycoddling me! - Be reasonable. Pull yourself together. Let me go, you! If I were a man, you would have to answer for this, Mr Nicholls. A change of sex could hardly make you more unjust than you are at this moment. Please, let's go home. The whole village is talking about it. I cannot allow my curates to be involved in scandals of this sort. I'm afraid you'll have to go, Nichols. Very well, sir. Just a moment, Mr Nicholls. Father. I claim full responsibility for the lamentable happenings of last evening. Mr Nicholls action was prompted by his wish to spare my sisters more disgrace. Indeed, he took the only course possible for a gentleman. I did not employ Mr Nicholls as a gentleman. And as for you, sir. I should prefer not see your face for a very long time. Such talk cannot hurt me, father. I am already too numbed by the great blows of destiny. The toe of my boot should be your destiny. Nicholls .. you may stay. But in the future, keep your fists to yourself. He should have cracked your skull. I thank you for your honesty. - It was nothing. Can you lend me a shilling? - No. No. One can hardly expect a clergyman to practice the charity he preaches. You're not nearly as bad as you imagine. I do not imagine myself to be bad at all. I am much misjudged by my sisters. Who I have no doubt have already poisoned your mind against me. Ungrateful wretches. What have you ever done to earn their gratitude? If I had any money, I should do a great deal. What? Anything that would take them and their tedious enthusiasms out of this house. Do you know, Branwell. I've never seen any of your pictures. [ Door knocks ] Yes? Why, Miss Emily. Good afternoon, Mr Nicholls. - Please come in. Thank you. Tabby just baked this cake. She thought you might take it to that poor family .. On Leyton Street when you visit them this afternoon. That was very thoughtful of Tabby. And very kind of you to bring it. Please sit down. We haven't seen much of you over these past few days, Mr Nicholls. I imagined my presence at the vicarage will occasion nothing but embarrassment. You must not let yourself be intimidated by Charlotte. In any case, she is so excited by this morning's good news that .. Our misfortunes at Thornton House are all but forgotten. Branwell, has sold his picture: "The Castaway". Oh .. please offer him my warmest congratulations. He has most generously offered to send Charlotte and me to Brussels. We are to complete our education there at the "Pension Heger". That is splendid of Branwell. I'm very pleased. I realize how much this must mean to you and Miss Bront?. Charlotte is delighted. And you are not? But Miss Emily, I thought it was your aim, your dream. Dreams that come true, are no longer dreams, Mr Nicholls. But think, Miss Emily .. I can only think that even now it is not too late. Anne could go in my place. Tell me I need not go, Mr Nicholls. I'm afraid I can't tell you that, Miss Emily. And it will give me intense pleasure to acquaint the insufferable Mr Nicholls .. With Branwell's magnificent gesture. I like Mr Nicholls. I think he's a gentleman of great integrity. He is not a gentleman at all. Let us get on with Emily's things. Dear Emily. What a wonderful experience this will be for her. [ French language ] Perfect. Monsieur Heger will be delighted. Delight is an emotion unknown to Monsieur Heger. You are quite wrong. Possibly, Charlotte. - Why don't you like Monsieur Heger? Oh. Too much head .. too little heart. If you were married to Madame Heger .. - Speak a little louder, Charlotte. I do not think Giselle could quite hear what you were saying. That was rude, Emily. Well, I cannot endure the superior airs affected by the French girls here. Anyone would think they had won Waterloo. Ah, Mademoiselle Charlotte. Yes, Monsieur Heger? I have read your notebook. Every word. Thank you, Monsieur. I appreciate the honour of letting me into your mind. It is a most beautiful world, and you have a real talent for expressing it. That is a great compliment from a critic of your standards if you really mean it. But I do. You have made a brilliant and original discovery. I, a discovery? And what is that Monsieur? That "woman" is actually the lover. And not merely the one who is loved. As writers have tried to prove for thousands of years. But women have always known that to be so, Monsieur. Of course, and men have always tried to conceal it from them. The extraordinary thing is. That it should first be revealed by an English girl. Now, to get back to your notebook. I have also noticed that you .. Charlotte. Must you parade your popularity with Mr Heger in front of these awful girls? You know how it infuriates me. Why should I be secretive about a friendship I value very highly? Now Mademoiselle Blanche, what is your complaint? Well, Madame Heger. Because those English girls are permitted to give a few lessons .. They seem to have forgotten that they are still only pupils here. Mademoiselle Charlotte is a dangerous one. Always running to Monsieur Heger with her little "suggestions". Trying to impress him with her own efficiency. I think you have formed an inaccurate estimate of Mlle. Charlotte's character. I may be wrong, of course. Perhaps Mademoiselle Charlotte's pursuit of Monsieur Heger. Is prompted by her desire to improve her French. Mademoiselle Charlotte is a pupil of unusual brilliance. We have great hopes for her future. Yes, she is certainly the young lady to be watched. She is still very young. Sometimes a little headstrong, a little impetuous. But her intentions are I am sure, excellent. I don't anticipate any trouble from Mademoiselle Charlotte. You may go, Mademoiselle Blanche. - Oui. C'est tres bien, Madame. Asseyez vous, mes enfants. Good afternoon, Miss Charlotte. The lesson goes well, yes? Yes thank you, Madame Heger. They are reciting some verse now. Ah .. some of your own, perhaps? What makes you think I write verse, Madame? A little bird told me. Continue, Mademoiselle. Recommenc? Mathilde. "Neither a borrower nor a lender be." "For loan oft loses both itself and friend." "And borrowing dulls the edge of husbandry." "This above all. To thine own self be true." "And it must follow, as the night the day." Asseyez vous, Mademoiselles. What are you doing this afternoon, Miss Emily? This is a musical-accomplishment class, Monsieur Heger. And what has been accomplished? - Well .. That is perhaps, something I should judge for myself. Now, Marie. Will you be kind enough to play for me. No, Marie. You must show a little more reluctance. I am very sorry Monsieur Heger, but I have forgotten to bring my music. Surely, there is something you can play by ear? Well, there is one little piece. She was right. She has forgotten her music. Now, Marie. You can do better than that. Play the Chopin Prelude in A-Major. You know that very well. Oh, charming. One of my favourite pieces. Please continue, Marie. She cannot continue what she has already finished, Monsieur Heger. Of course. Of course. What was I thinking about. [ French language ] Miss Emily. It seems that I grow absent-minded in my old age. That will never do, will it. No Monsieur Heger. I don't think it will. Are you coming out, Emily? Ah, Miss Charlotte. There is one thing I must say to you. It is natural enough that you would take an interest in your sister's teachings. In future I would prefer it if you would limit your attentions to your own class. My attention does not always follow my eyes, Monsieur Heger. And I am well aware of my duties. Oh, you mustn't take me so seriously, Miss Charlotte. She's not forgiven me for seeing more in her writing than she wants to be there. That is not true, Monsieur Heger. But since you have raised the point. Why should it be so surprising that a writer should know something of life? Do not misunderstand me, Miss Charlotte. My little laugh was a kind one. I was merely curious in view of your quiet background. As to where you might have observed those mature and worldly passions. Which you write of so brilliantly. Naturally, she makes them up. And I think that an even greater tribute to her talent. Allow me to speak for myself, Emily. Monsieur Heger, you can't possibly know what my past life has been. As a matter of fact, my experiences in the world you mention .. Have been quite revealing. - Charlotte! Oh, there is a letter for you from England, Miss Charlotte. Thank you, Madame. - Run along. She'll have success, that Charlotte. Certainly. She works hard enough. So, father's eyes are troubling him. Aunt has a cold .. Branwell is behaving disgracefully and Keeper is losing his hair. Do you know, Emily, in the three months we've been here .. I don't believe Anne has sent us any good news once. Charlotte .. will you please tell me something. What induced you to act that extraordinary scene for Monsieur Heger? Act? - Yes. Hinting of non-existent romances. And presenting yourself as a rather disillusioned woman of the world. There are some things, Emily, which I thought it better not to tell you. But now perhaps, you might as well know. I did have one rather .. Well, unpleasant experience while I was as Stone Gap. And only my ability to cope with such things saved me from having another one. Much nearer home. - What do you mean, Charlotte? I haven't mentioned this to you before, Emily, because .. Well, because I was too ashamed. But you might as well know now. On the evening of the Thornton House ball. That insufferable Mr Nicholls tried to kiss me. In fact, he did kiss me. Mr Nicholls? - Yes. That was hardly the action of a gentleman, was it? There is no need to look startled. It all happened a long time ago. And I can assure you I was quite equal to the situation. Now let us see what Anne has to say in this important looking postscript. Emily! They are going to publish two of our poems. In The Cornhill magazine. Thackeray has read them and asks: "Who are these brilliant brothers"? Mr Nicholls does you the honour of loving you. Why do you always speak so slightingly of him? The honour of loving me? You must be mad. He'd probably been overindulging himself with the elderberry wine. Oh Emily .. it has begun. It's started to come true. I must go and tell Monsieur Heger at once. Monsieur Heger was delighted about our poems. He's promised to take us to the exhibition. Won't that be wonderful? What is the matter with you, Emily? Monsieur Heger said .. - Charlotte, my dear. Do you mind? But I believe I've heard enough of Monsieur Heger for one day. Why are you so unfair to him? I've never known a man more gentle and considerate in every way. I can quite appreciate his gift of charm, Charlotte. But I want you to be happy, that's all. Let us forget the subject. Of course, you write like an angel, Emily. But I can assure you. Love is not the tormented thing you are making it in your book. And you know, I find your people very strange. Somehow, they do not seem very real to me. When are you going to finish your book, Charlotte? I don't know. I don't want to write now. I'm much too busy living. Or is it dreaming? Well .. whatever it is. It suits me admirably. There are those whom it may not suit so admirably, Charlotte. Oh! Whatever is the matter, Emily? The rider on the moor. I saw him. Oh, do go to sleep, dear. I saw his face. There is so little time. Wonderful. Oh no, my dear Carlotta. It was not wonderful at all. It was the China duck at which I was aiming. Then I'm glad you missed because I would rather have the clock. Thank you. Oh, I wish Emily were here to enjoy all this. Why did she have to have a headache tonight of all nights? I do not think she has a headache. She is just very unhappy, poor child. - Whatever makes you think that? You must take good care of your sister, Carlotta. You must guard her as if she were your own conscience. For that is exactly what she is. I have a perfectly good conscience of my own, thank you. Oh, no you haven't. But don't look so distressed, my dear. You are probably a great deal more attractive without one. I wish you'd treat me as a grown-up person. Ah, that would be a very dangerous thing to do. Oh, the "Tunnel Of Mystery". Would you care to try this experience, Carlotta? I would like to very much. - Oh, then you are very brave. I wonder why it is called the Tunnel Of Mystery. That is what we are going to discover. Well? Now the mystery of the tunnel is explained. Monsieur Heger. I shouldn't have. I thought you wished to be treated as a grown-up person. Oh, but surely, you must realize that it was wrong. I mean .. You are married. - Yes, I am married. But that is a detail which has escaped your attention until a few moments ago. Monsieur Heger. No, Carlotta. You cannot have it both ways. You're a dreadful, though charming, little hypocrite. And if I were to apologize, I would be one too. In that case, I think we had better go home. If that is your wish, my dear. I am sorry if I have offended you, Carlotta. Nevertheless, I shall remember this evening with much happiness. I shall remember it forever. Oh Monsieur Heger, I know I've been very young and foolish. But I could bear that you should regard me lightly. But I do not. Knowing you has been the happiest experience of my life. Carlotta. You do care for me a little, don't you? You are so very sweet, Carlotta. How could I do otherwise? Goodnight. Goodnight. Oh Emily, I've had such a wonderful evening. Whatever are you doing? I've had a letter from Anne. Branwell is terribly ill. We'll have to go home at once, Charlotte. Go home? - Yes. Did Anne say so? No, but I can tell from the tone of her letter that that's what she meant. Branwell is always being ill, and he always recovers. We should look very foolish if we rushed home and found him perfectly well. Branwell, to whom we owe our education here. Is probably dying. Now, get your trunk packed. I shall do nothing of the sort. You never liked this place, Emily. And you're probably only too glad to leave. But I have no intention of giving up my education here. The sooner you end the form education in which you indulge at this moment. The better it will be for everyone. I don't know what you are talking about. And I refuse to sacrifice my career for any hysterical whim of yours. I'm going to ask Monsieur Heger. What can I do for you, Miss Charlotte? My brother is ill. - Oh .. that is sad. Naturally you feel you must return to England. Emily thinks so .. I don't know. I wanted to ask Monsieur Heger's advice. Well, I think that Monsieur Heger will tell you that in matters like this. One must ask the advice of one's conscience. In your case, I am sure it would be a most reliable test. You cannot wait to get rid of me, can you? You are a clever pupil and a very satisfactory teacher. Why should I want to get rid of you? Because I love your husband. All our girls love Monsieur Heger. He has quite a way with him. Is something the matter, Miss Charlotte? Monsieur Heger, I told her. I had to. You told her what, Miss Charlotte? - I told her of our love. Mademoiselle Charlotte is upset. She's had bad news from England. Her brother is ill. So she and her sister must go home. I'm sure Emily over-exaggerates the seriousness of the situation. I don't think it will be necessary. - Miss Charlotte. I have a great faith in your courage. I shall not presume to advise you. I think you know what you must do. Monsieur Heger. You won't send me away like this. I .. - I'm not sending you, Miss Charlotte. It only seems wise that you go. Now my dear, it is long past your bedtime. Goodnight, Miss Charlotte. Now really, my dear .. I've been wrong about almost everything that really mattered. I may even have been wrong about poor Mr Nicholls. Perhaps you were right. Perhaps he did love me. What do you think, Emily? I think, Charlotte .. that you've had a severe shock. But I also think. That you will recover with a rapidity that may astonish even yourself. Look. There's England. "I was only going to say that .." "Heaven did not seem to be my home." "And I broke my heart with weeping, to come back to earth." "But the angels were so angry." "That they flung me out into the middle of the heath." "On top of Wuthering Heights." "Where I woke, sobbing for joy." That's as far as I've got. Yes, it's all there, Emily. All that need be told. Perhaps a little more besides. That's the kind of book I should like to have written. Oh, you could have written a better book than this, Branwell. You still could. There is no need for that sort of eyewash between us, Emily. Of course, one thing is as clear as daylight about the two books. You are both in live with the same man. Now don't get excited, my dear. I don't expect that anyone but your discerning brother will ever notice it. Charlotte certainly won't. She never sees an inch beyond her aristocratic nose. You are not attempting any passionate denials, I notice. I've never been able to deceive you, Branwell. You are giving it too much thought, my dear. What are you talking about? That pretty view. You haven't been looking at all well lately. You're imagining things, Branwell. All the same, I should lose no time in finishing that masterpiece of yours. Try and get some sleep, Branwell. Will there be nothing else today, Miss Bront?? Let me see. We have some very nice Brussels sprouts, ma'am. Brussels sprouts? - Yes. And only tuppence a pound. Yes, I think I will have .. No, thank you, Mr Tripp. Nothing more today. - Very well, Miss Bront?. Why, Mr Nicholls. What a pleasant surprise. It's a small world, isn't it. I was on my way to the vicarage to return these chapters of your book. Oh, then you may walk back with me. And on the way back you can tell me your truthful opinion of Jane Eyre. How do you do, Mrs Hartness. - How do you do, Miss Bront?. I'm sorry you cannot stay for tea. I'm sorry too, Miss Bront?. Do you think you could spare the time to see Branwell for a minute before you go? Do you think that Branwell would care to see me? Of course. - Very well then. Mr Nicholls. Since my return I've done my best to atone for my previous injustice to you. You have been kindness itself. - Then what is it? Whenever possible, you avoid me. And when you cannot avoid me you laugh at me. Miss Bront?. May I say that .. I see you for what you are. And what you are pleases me. And if I attempt to avoid you or laugh at you. That is my feeble defence. But from what do you wish to defend yourself? From liking you too well. Shall we go in? I've a visitor to see you, Branwell. - Hello Branwell. You are looking much better today. Good afternoon, Miss Emily. - Good afternoon, Mr Nicholls. It was good of you to come, Mr Nicholls. But I am not ready to see a priest yet. How do you feel? Thanks to the forced confinement imposed on me by these charming jailers here. I remain in very poor health, thank you. Your charming jailers are quite as anxious as you are for your recovery. They too, would appreciate a little more freedom. The martyr's crown sits most uneasily on that elegant brow of yours, Charlotte. Then I surrender it willingly, to you. I don't think these family exchanges can be so amusing to Mr Nicholls, Branwell. On the contrary. I find Branwell's persistent attempts to shock me most diverting. I sometime think Nicholls, that you regard my family .. As a troop of players performing for your benefit. That shows how little you know me. But beware lest one day you are called on to play a part in our wretched story. Wretched story? What nonsense, Branwell. Oh come, Branwell. Don't try and make a tragedy of your little comedy of errors. I can see no comedy in the error I suspect you are about to commit. Branwell! Emily, do not try and save a situation when there is no situation to save. Or is there? Well, I must be off to my parish meeting. The next time I come to see you Branwell, don't talk in riddles. I'm a very simple fellow. If you had the least idea of what I was talking about. I doubt if you would care to come and see me again. Go and get yourself some tea, Emily. I'll stay here and tidy up. Goodbye, Mr Nicholls. Goodbye. Emily. Why don't you let Mr Nicholls read your book? My book could have little interest for Mr Nicholls, Branwell. Oh do let him. He has been most kind about mine. I do not choose to, Charlotte. Of course, if your object is to make Mr Nicholls leave us .. Wasn't that your object not so long ago, Charlotte? The air in this room is stifling. The air of anticipated success that you exude would make any room seem stifling. Why are you so ill-disposed towards me, Branwell? Ill-disposed? Nonsense. You saved my life. What? - Certainly. The knowledge that my continued existence hurts you immeasurably. Is the only thing that makes my life worth living. You don't mean that, Branwell. But whatever you may say, or whatever you may do. I shall never forget the great sacrifice you made for us. I am much too ill and too tired. To go on playing the role of hero, saviour or anything else. So let me inform you that I did not send you to Brussels. Nicholls bought my picture on the condition that you and Emily .. Should be sent abroad to complete your education. Now that you know I've done nothing to earn your gratitude, will you please go. Thank you for being so truthful with me, Branwell. But contrary to your expectations. I have now more reason to be grateful to you than ever. Of course, we shall have to repay him. Every penny of it. We can discuss that tomorrow. But if any proof were needed that he loves me. This is it .. don't you agree? I agreed a long time ago. Yes you did. You are very clever, Emily. I'm afraid you have a rather poor impression of my emotional reactions. After what happened in Brussels. That schoolgirl hysteria. But .. This is different. I never guessed that love would be such a quiet thing. Why doesn't he speak? Can you imagine why, Emily? Oh, Emily. Why must you always fall asleep? Just when the conversation has begun to get interesting. Now Branwell, you'll sleep like a top after you've had this. Nah .. milk always keeps me awake. No, Anne. I think this poor tired heart of mine needs a little stimulus. A little of father's brandy would work wonders for me. Run downstairs and get it. There's a good girl. No Branwell, you know that is strictly against orders. Alright. Leave me to die in peace, you murderess. Goodnight, dear Branwell. Sleep well. Blast the girl. I shall be forced to use my own, I suppose. There's precious little left, too. [ Door knocks ] Yes? I'm sorry. I thought your father was here. There were a couple of books he said I might borrow. Father has gone out with Aunt Branwell and Anne to the village concert. Please take whatever you wish, Mr Nicholls. Thank you. Are you unable to find what you are looking for, Mr Nicholls? You can't do this, Miss Emily. You can't become a governess. - How did you know? Anne told me. I've all but finished my book, Mr Nicholls. When it is done, I shall naturally be anxious to secure a position for myself. But you are a poet. A dreamer of great dreams. You can't become a servant. Oh, but I can, quite easily. With the beautiful and extensive education you saw fit to bestow upon me. I imagine I could be almost anything. Yes, Mr Nicholls. As you must know, reticence is not one of Branwell's strong points. I thought what I did would be for the best. And from your point of view it most assuredly was. You gave Charlotte what she wanted. And got rid of me at the same time. It's quite a tour-de-force. - How can you say such things? Because I am a human being. There can be nothing but truth between you and me, Miss Emily. But if the village is too small for the three of us. It is not you who shall go. I have tried to stop loving you. I really have tried, Mr Nicholls. Emily, please .. - What is it, Charlotte? Come quickly. It's Branwell. He's not in the house. I've looked everywhere. Oh Charlotte. - He may have gone to The Bull. What are you doing? - To find him. He can't have got far. Your coat, Emily! It is pouring .. Something wrong, Miss Charlotte? Branwell's gone to The Bull. Emily's gone to bring him back. Leave it to me. If he's at The Bull I'll have him home in a very few minutes. I'm coming too. Just let me get my coat and Emily's. If only she hadn't gone out in that thin dress. Branwell! Branwell! Emily. Branwell. The first time I've .. I've failed to get to The Inn. Usually, it's the .. Home journey that's so difficult. Try and get up, Branwell. I'll help you. Come on Branwell. This is a poor finish. Oh, please try. For me, Branwell. Please try. Branwell. Branwell. He's gone, Charlotte. Miss Bront?. Miss Emily. I can't make speeches. And I don't think I need explain what knowing you both has meant to me. So let me just wish you the great success you so truly merit. Goodbye, Miss Bront?. Goodbye, Mr Nicholls. Goodbye, Miss Emily. - Goodbye. Mr Nicholls. Tell me why you are leaving us. Because I am not a big enough man to live side by side with greatness. Nor am I so small that I can stand by and witness its torment. I don't understand. One day you will, dear Charlotte. I know nothing .. I understand nothing. And yet I have dared to write two hundred thousand words about life. Rest assured, Madam. Jane Eyre will have the whole town talking. Of course, Jane Eyre is a better book than Wuthering Heights. Why look at the way it is selling. - But look at the people who are buying. "She heard a voice from somewhere cry: " "Jane .. Jane .. Jane." You observe, Thackeray. That Mr Currer Bell will have no cause to complain when he comes to London. Did "Vanity Fair" ever have a display like that? Vanity Fair didn't need it. And remember, my dear Smith. It was I who urged you to publish these three talented young men. I also remember that you prophesied a dazzling future for Wuthering Heights. Which incidentally, turned out the least successful of the three. I never said Wuthering Heights would be the most successful. It is merely the greatest of the three. As a publisher, that is a distinction you won't understand, Smith. The Press won't be in a very receptive frame of mind. They've been outside for fifteen minutes at least. The way you toady to these literary jackals distresses me, Smith. And it seems to have escaped your attention .. That I have been waiting for half an hour. However. I will drop in this evening and take a look at your "discovery". As you quite mistakenly call Mr Bell. Thackeray .. I can tell you now what Currer Bell looks like. He's a tall, slim sensitive man. With a profound understanding of women. - Nonsense. The author of Jane Eyre is unquestionably short and stout. A middle-aged romantic. Frustrated by fifty years in the dismal dampness of a Yorkshire vicarage. May I ask how you happen to know that Mr Bell comes from a Yorkshire vicarage? By glancing through your correspondence while you kept me waiting the other day. I had to occupy myself somehow. Well, really .. - Now don't explode, Smith. Authors get some of their best material by a careful perusal of letters .. Not intended for them. My carriage, please. - Yes, sir. I think you've behaved monstrously. And if you dare say a word to the pressmen .. Don't worry my dear Smith, I have no intention of becoming involved .. In your vulgar exploitations. And now gentlemen, if you will come with me to my office. Could you please tell me when I might see Mr Smith? I've been waiting here for some time but it seems difficult to get attention. My dear young lady, I'm afraid you will not get attention today. Mr Smith, with his fellow fudgers of the press. Is lying in ambush. Awaiting the arrival of his next victim: one "Currer Bell". Good heavens. I never expected there would be such a fuss over me .. Well .. - Oh .. So you are Currer Bell? Yes. But I must confess I was not quite prepared for .. for this ordeal. A most understandable point of view, my dear young lady. You are probably thoroughly fatigued after your journey. Now, if you will come with me. Thank you. But I doubt the gentlemen of the press like to be kept waiting. On the contrary, my dear young lady. Such treatment is meat and drink to their servile souls. What you need first of all, is a little refreshment. Which I will undertake to provide. - But I do not know you, sir. Oh yes you do. My name is "Thackeray". Not the great Thackeray? Aren't we being a little personal, my dear? I think Emily would like the Cheshire cheese. Why didn't your genius sister come with you to receive the homage of London? She's not been in very good health lately. But I doubt if she would have come anyway. She detests crowds. I thought so. One gathers that in her book. But I think she's every happy in that strange, lonely world of hers. She's never had the slightest desire to meet anyone outside the family you know. Indeed? Then, if it is not a too impertinent a question. How did she come to experience so great and tragic a love? Tragic love? Emily is the most loving and loveable person in the world. But if you are implying that she's experienced a great, romantic passion. I can assure you that such is not the case. When .. did you last read Wuthering Heights? I'm going to make the most terrible confession, Mr Thackeray. I never have read it all. Well you should. It's quite good, you know. One would imagine you had been doing this all your life. I have been dreaming it all my life. Well? Jane Eyre seems to have stepped into the pages of Vanity Fair. Good morning, Thackeray. - Good morning, Dickens. Charles Dickens? And you never introduced me! I shouldn't like you to get mixed up with that kind of riff-raff, my dear. Bennett. What does it feel like to be a lion? It depends entirely upon the keeper and the food, Mr Thackeray. If you continue to be so penetratingly intelligent .. You'll never be happy, my child. Do they always stare at you like that in public? They're staring at you, my dear. Oh. "But through it all, I could not help to think how Branwell would have laughed." Well, as she seems to have accomplished everything. Yes, everything. Except the one thing nearest her heart. My brother Branwell always said .. That riding a path with Thackeray would be the height of success. He was quite right, of course. It is. But you're not looking at the height of anything at the moment. I was wondering if you would ever walk with me on the moors of Haworth? Huh? Moors were intended to be written about. Not walked on. Are you so fearful of not being recognised .. That you must take your novel out driving with you, Miss Bront?? Oh, this is for a friend. Mr Thackeray, how far is it to the East End? The East End? Geographically, about four miles. Socially, over a thousand. You are not suggesting we go there, are you? Miss Bront?, I have a sincere regard for you as an author. And a deep affection as a friend. But if you imagine I am going to take you to the East End .. A district inhabited exclusively by thieves and cut-throats. There your imagination is even more fanciful .. Than some of your purple passages in Jane Eyre suggest. And that is saying a good deal. So, this is where your Parson friend lives? Yes. This is the address. Not a very good one, I fear. Aren't you coming in with me, Mr Thackeray? No my dear. I think I'll stay here and admire this pretty view. Not my public. [ Door knocks ] There is a lady to see you, sir. This is indeed a pleasure, Miss Bront?. I felt that .. I could not leave London without finding out how you were faring. And Mr Thackeray very graciously consented to drive me down here. That was very kind of him. I .. I have brought you a first edition of my novel. I shall treasure this copy. I have, of course, read the novel. It is the beautiful piece of work I knew it would be. So it has all turned out exactly as you planned. Not exactly. You see, I thought I would be happy. I must not keep Mr Thackeray waiting any longer. Mr Nicholls. At our last meeting you said that .. I would one day understand. I'm afraid that day is still to dawn. I believed .. But then, you know what I believed. You believe truly. Then tell me. I love you. I've always loved you. Oh, what was it? What barrier stood between us for so long? I left Haworth. Because Miss Emily offered me a love I could not return. Emily. [ Thackeray's voice: ] "How did she come to experience so great and tragic a love?" "When did you last read Wuthering Heights?" Oh .. Emily. "It has been a wonderful experience." "Everybody has been most kind. Mr Thackeray, especially so." "On Tuesday, I visited the National Portrait Gallery." "And saw many pictures of uncommon beauty." Doctor Barnes has been with Emily a dreadfully long time, hasn't he. Doctor Barnes is a very thorough and painstaking man. We should only be thankful that Emily has at last consented to see him. I'm not. If Emily has finally consented to see a doctor it can only mean .. Enough of that talk, Miss. Proceed with the letter. "I had hoped by this time, that Anne and Emily would have been able to join me." "Surely, Emily is sufficiently recovered by now to .." I can't go on .. I really can't. There, child. Don't take on so. I'll have no more of this. Emily's wishes or no, I shall write to Charlotte tonight. Leave them in the hall for the moment. - Yes, Miss Bront?. Well .. isn't anyone pleased to see me? Charlotte! - Charlotte, my dear! My dear child. - Of course we are glad to see you. Charlotte, what brings you home so suddenly? We have not been expecting you for weeks. We thought you were enjoying yourself in London. London was very kind. However one can have too much of a good thing. Where is Emily? - She is upstairs. She'll be so glad you are back. - Will she? I wonder. - Why, Charlotte .. Excuse me. Mr Bront?, I wonder if I might have a word with you and Miss Branwell. Most certainly. Come with me to my study. What is it? What's happened? Oh, Charlotte, she's grown steadily worse since you left. And you let me fritter away my time in London when Emily was seriously ill? I couldn't help it. She forbade me to write to you. I heard those footsteps. In the darkness of the jungle. I would know they were yours, Charlotte. - Oh, Emily. Oh, it's wonderful to see you again. But how could you bear to the scenes of your triumph so soon? Don't tell me success is an illusion. I should be horribly disappointed. Success is everything I hoped it might be. But there was something missing. What? - You, my darling. I don't believe a word of it. It's very nice to bask in that fatal charm of yours again. All the most interesting people I met .. Talked incessantly of Wuthering Heights. And Thackeray's last words to me were: "Pay my homage to that genius sister of yours." Bless the old cynic. And George Smith says that he won't have a moment's peace. Until he has your next book in his printing press. He'll have to wait a dreadfully long time, poor man. Nonsense, Emily. Now that I'm back to look after you, you'll be up and about in no time. Did you see him, Charlotte? Yes, Emily. Curiosity overcame my pride. And I went to see Nicholls. He was as pleasant and courteous to me, as ever. But I found that my old feeling for him was as dead as though it had never been. Please don't lie to me, Charlotte. Not tonight. There is so little time. You're not to say these things, Emily. You're not to. All our lives there has been too much left unsaid between us. Loving is the only thing that really matters, Charlotte. It's worthwhile being hurt a bit to find that out. The world has always frightened me a little. So I'm really not afraid to leave it now. Though sometimes .. When I hear the wind blowing through the heather. 0r see the sun go down beyond Wuthering Heights. I think perhaps .. I'd like to stay just a little longer. You're not trying, Emily. You can stay. You must stay. Listen, my dear one. Any good there is in me has come from you. Any courage that I have ever shown has been inspired by you. You are everything that I would wish to be myself. A life without you .. Would have no meaning. When he comes back. And he will. You'll find the meaning, Charlotte. And it will be a much happier one than I could ever teach you. Emily. Emily. Doctor Barnes. I have found the meaning .. dear Emily. Goodbye, my dear one. (R0_s)
