[EKG BEEPING] BAUMAN: Good morning. NURSE: Good morning, doctor. BAUMAN: Mr. Rane, would you like one last look at your face before I proceed? I never live in the past. No, thank you. I must give you something for the pain. There will be no pain. Proceed. [SIRENS WAILING] Scalpel. [WOMAN SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY OVER RADIO] All right, you know the drill. Be very, very careful. - This is Charles Rane we're dealing with. -Where is he? Plastic surgery. Third floor. He keeps changing his face. If we blow this, we won't get another chance. Move out! - What time is it, doctor? -What? I want you to tell me what time it is. Twelve o'clock. [BAUMAN GRUNTING] [NURSE SCREAMS] OFFICER 1: Get into that closet right now. DOCTOR: Hey! OFFICER 2: Go! Go! Go! OFFICER 3: Move! - There he goes! OFFICER 2: Go! Go! Go! [SCREAMS] OFFICER 2: Move it out there! [ALL GRUNT] - Stairs! OFFICER 3: Move! MAN 1 : Hey! [HORN HONKS] [SIREN WAILING] MAN 2: Hey! [HORN HONKS] OFFICER 1: Stop it right there! Don't move! OFFICER 2: Freeze! OFFICER 3: Hold it right there! Hold it. OFFICER 4: Don't move! Don't move! -Charles Rane, FBI. You're under arrest. [SIREN WAILING] Enjoy the flight. [GUN CLICKS] - There you go. WOMAN: Thank you. You're welcome. Listen up! Shut up! Sit! Look, do as I say and nobody gets hurt. - You have the keys to the flight deck? -Yes. All right, we're gonna move there nice and slow. Don't make me use this. Nice and slow. There you go. Real nice. Real nice. [MARTI & CUTTER GRUNT] Turn it off. Turn it off! [SIGHS] May I ask you what you were doing? I was improvising on your security techniques. [CROWD LAUGHS] That's cute. That's real cute, Miss...? Slayton. But my friends call me Marti. Well. See... ...if this had been a real gun... ...that Angie Dickinson shit you just pulled? You would've got your head blown off. And endangered the lives of the other passengers. I was trying to save lives. The next time a man holds a gun to your head... ...on a crowded plane, you follow instructions. You do exactly what he tells you to do. - Do you understand? -This is why I gave up my afternoon? So some former security specialist can tell me how to obey a hijacker? First of all, I'm not a former anything. Second of all, I like what I do. I get the chance to meet people like you. Well, I know we got a lot of information to think about... ...so class dismissed, and, uh... ...we'll hijack you again next week. - What the hell are you doing here? -I'm doing fine, Cutter. You? What's wrong with your foot? Sly, I appreciate you throwing some business my way... ...but that gives you no right to interfere. Cutter, will you look around? This is an airline training facility. This is not the Secret Service. Calm down. Oh, now you're telling me my job too, huh? Look, what she did was wrong. Period. There was a time you'd have let her know that without blowing your cool. Just dawned on me. She kind of reminds me of Lisa. She looks nothing like Lisa. Didn't say she looked like her, I said she reminded me of her. - We gotta talk. -Not interested in coming back. - Did I ask you to? -You were about to. Right. You can't tell me teaching security techniques to bodyguards... ...night watchmen and flight attendants is what you wanna do. It's a job. I like it. Ramsey wants me to hire the best person available... ...to head up the Counterterrorism Unit. That person is you. - I don't want that responsibility. -I don't wanna be so good-looking. But I deal with the hand that's dealt me. We both know nobody can do the job better than you. I knew you were gonna start this shit again. Give me my check. - You want me to stop? -Yes. Just say, "Yes, I'll take the job." I'll stop. Damn it, Sly. Give it a rest. No, you give it a rest, John. This isn't about a job. This is about you, okay? Nobody knows better than I do how much Lisa meant to you. But you gotta stop blaming yourself. You gotta get off the sidelines, you gotta get back into this game. I set up a lunch tomorrow with Ramsey at 12:00 at The Oxford. I hope you'll be there. I really do. INMATE 1; Hey, chula. INMATE 2; Hey, baby. INMATE s; Hey. INMATE 4; Pretty boy. INMATE 5: Hey. INMATE 6: Yeah. INMATE 7: Whoa, man. Look at that pretty-assed white girl there. - What's her name? INMATE 8: Hey. [INMATES JEERING INDISTINCTLY] Attorney Phillips. Have you found out where they intend to take me? Los Angeles. But they won't say when. It will happen quickly. Notify my people. They'll know what to do. California has a death penalty. It's a progressive state. - I'll have to visit it sometime. -The feds have a witness that can prove... ...you're responsible for two airline bombings in the past year. I'm responsible for twice that amount. [PHILLIPS SIGHS] I'm afraid the most we can hope for is that I claim insanity for you. Given your childhood history, we should be able to make that stick. Never mention my childhood. - Have I made myself clear? -Yeah. It is the nature of man to confuse genius with insanity. [PHILLIPS GASPS] Now... ...repeat after me. Charles Rane... ...is not insane. Charles Rane... ...is not insane. Again. Charles Rane is not insane. Continue. Charles Rane is not insane. CUTTER: Put some of this on the fire. - All right? -Yes. A kiss. [CHUCKLES] Fine ass, yeah. Merry Christmas, motherfucker! Open the register and give me the money now! Shut up! Give it to me now! Open the register! Now! Freeze! Drop it! [GUNFIRE] Get back or I'll blow this bitch's head off right now! Get back! Get the fuck back! Put the gun down! Put the fucking gun down! All right. I'm putting the gun down. You just stay cool, all right? Everything gonna be all right, baby. Not gonna try to stop you, man. You shouldn't have tried the first time. [GUNSHOT & CUTTER YELLS] [GUNFIRE] Oh, my God. Lisa. Lisa! On. on, baby. It's gonna be all right. It's all right. It's not too bad, baby. Oh, God, what have I done? [SIREN WAILING IN DISTANCE] CUTTER: No. Lisa. [CHATTERING] Hey. What do you know? Here he is. John. - John Cutter, Stuart Ramsey. -Pleasure. Nice to meet you, John. Mr. Delvecchio said you might not be coming. Yeah, well, Mr. Delvecchio was wrong. Let's have a seat. Do you know how many airlines have been hijacked in the last three years? - No. -Twenty-seven. Almost every commercial airline in the world... ...has had to cope with terrorism. All except one. The Israelis have never been fucked with. They never let them on the plane. Do you have any thoughts on this? Unequivocally, without a doubt, John is the best guy I ever worked with. The annual meeting of our stockholders is next week in Los Angeles. I'd like to fly you out a couple days early. You can have a brief vacation... ...before I introduce you as... ...our new vice president. That is, assuming you still want the job. SLY: I'll drink to that. SLY: So look, when you meet this board of directors... ...you should think of something really impressive to say... ...to start things off. Let's see, maybe I'll ask them to fire you. [SLY CHUCKLES] Actually, this isn't a good time to start with new plans. Just be yourself. Dignified and charming. [BEEPS] Sir, you'll have to go back through. Carrying any metal objects? Yeah. You ever notice how the real suspicious ones... ...never have any trouble? -That's right. That's how they get on the plane. [BEEPS] Oh, man. Sorry, I'm gonna have to check you myself. SLY: It's that metal plate in his head. An old war wound. You can go through with your friend now. Thank you. You're welcome. - John. -What? Real quick. How do you do that? Before you get on the plane, how do you do that? A black thing. You wouldn't understand. I understand black things. That's what I admire about you, Cutter. Even though you're being hit on by an absolutely beautiful woman... ...you are determined to maintain your vow of chastity. You'd make a hell of a Republican. It is not necessary for you to walk me to the plane. It's the least I can do, you know? We're brothers. CLERK: Have a nice flight. Cutter, I have no idea why I am so nice to you. Look, you got me here. You satisfied? Now go. Aw, come on, man. Don't give me that sad-ass puppy-dog look. I'm not. I'm giving you the grateful, deeply moved, Italian-American... ...religiously inspired look. - There's a difference. -Why? Even though you'll never admit it, we both know you made the right decision. I'm only taking this job so I can make your life miserable. SLY: Is that right? -Yes. Right. Heh. At least this way I can get back at you, huh? Oh, speaking of which... ...have I got a surprise for you. No. No, no. No surprises. What is it? Lips are sealed. CUTTER: Your lips could be busted. What? -Listen to this. When you get to Los Angeles, call me... ...because I'm gonna wanna hear all about this one. - Hey, Sly, are you listening to me? SLY: Have a pleasant trip. CUTTER: Sly, you don't understand-- CLERK: Have a nice flight, Mr. Cutter. Thank you. [SIREN WAILING] Hi. Hi. FBI. Thank you. Hi. Mr. "Forget"? Forget. It's French. Oh, Monsieur Forget, you'll be in seat 5-C. That's the aisle seat. On the left. Thank you. [SPEAKS IN FRENCH] Norman, it is not polite to stare. SABRINA: May I take your coat, sir? Thank you. Any truth to the rumor that men in Los Angeles... ...actually talk without cue cards? -They talk a lot. Whether or not they say anything is another matter. - This is your first trip to Los Angeles? -It is, yeah. I'm Sabrina Ritchie. How do you do? Marti Slayton. Sabrina, what a beautiful name. It is a thing most wondrous to be flattered by one of your peers. Ooh, and I love the accent too. Heh. I've been trying to lose it for years. It makes me sound cold and heartless. Actually, now that you mention it... [BOTH CHUCKLE] - Always trust your first impression. -Ah. This is gonna be a very interesting flight. I certainly hope so. Hey, you taken the head count yet? Ah, my fingers are beginning to point as we speak. SABRINA: Champagne, madam? MARTI: One, two, three, four... ...five, six... [NORMAN MIMICS GUNSHOT] [MIMICS GUNSHOT] Behave yourself. You won't get any toys in prison. I never had any toys. My father believed they would warp my sense of values. Is your father still alive? Died... ...violently. Two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight... Fifty, 51, 52, 53... ...54, 55, 56, 57-- Fifty-eight, 59, so, 61 - Can I get you gentlemen anything? -Nothing right now, thanks. Okay. Well, looks like I just found my next ex-wife. Heh. Please make sure that all carry-on items are safely secured beneath your seats... ...or properly stored in an overhead compartment. I'm Marti. If there's anything I can do to make your trip more comfortable... ...please feel free to ask for my assistance. [BELL DINGING] [CLEARS THROAT] Who needs assistance this early? John Cutter. He's a security specialist for the airlines. Security? I feel safe already. [SIGHS] Menu, sir? Monsieur. Menu, sir? - Pardon me, stewardess? SABRINA: Yes? Is that man with the handcuffs dangerous? SABRINA: There's nothing to worry about. Right now, he's as safe as this handsome little boy. - What's your name, huh? -Norman. If he tries to do something bad, I'll shoot him. Ooh. What if he shoots back? I also have a secret decoder ring... ...that protects you from bullets and spiders... ...but I left it at home. Hey, don't worry, I've got mine, and I'll save all of us. Give me a smile, I might get you a soda. if that's all right with your mom. - Sure. -Orange? Hey, you got it. Thank you. Stewardess, I've had that light on for a while. Flight attendant. You go back to your seat, I'll bring you your peanuts. Well, actually, all I want is an aspirin. Oh. Here we go. Hey, look... ...maybe I was a little hard on you in class, but that was for your own good. Is this the way you apologize? Heh. Boy, this is gonna be a long flight. You've got that right. Excuse me. Excuse me. Well, then, maybe you can just do me a favor? This ought to be good. I'm not all that comfortable on planes, you know. There's some extra pillows in your overhead compartment. Whenever anything moves faster than I can walk... ...I'd just as soon be behind the wheel. Who would have guessed that you're a control freak? - You're not gonna make this easy. -What can I do to make your travel pleasurable? I just want you to check on me from time to time. That's it. You take your seat and I'll see what I can do. Champagne with your dinners, gentlemen? Um, not on duty. But I'll have tomato juice if you have it. And I'll have the chicken. How appropriate. I'll have the steak. Keep the champagne on ice. We'll celebrate later. Sir, this is Mrs. Edwards. She's a frequent air traveler. When I told her all about you... ...she volunteered to help make you feel more comfortable. It's a real honor to meet you. I take this flight at least once a month. I have grandchildren in Van Nuys. That's just outside Los Angeles. Well, maybe not just outside, but hell, Los Angeles is so spread out... ...who's to know where it begins and ends, what's inside and outside? Don't you agree? Ha, ha. Wait till I tell everyone that I sat next to you on the plane. I watch your show all the time. - My show? -Never miss it. Ooh, ooh, ooh! Ha, ha. And I just love it when you do those jokes about: Things that make you go "Hmm." [LINE RINGING] Robert. SABRINA [OVER PHONE]: I need a special service in first class in five minutes- I'll send it right up. I just loved it when you told off that Madonna. Who is she to tell you how to wear your hair? Excuse me, I have to go to the bathroom. I'll probably be in there a long time. Oh, I'm that way too. [EDWARDS CHUCKLES] Oh, man, I don't need this. I don't need this at all. Do you know the time? Why? You got someplace you gotta go? [MANNING CHUCKLES] How do you like your sirloin, sir? Bloody. [PASSENGERS SCREAM] Everybody, sit down! Be quiet and you won't get hurt! [PASSENGERS SCREAMING] - Who's in charge? -I am. Once again. Who's in charge? You are. Excellent. HIJACKER 1: Quiet! Quiet! Sit your ass down! Sit down! - Sit down! -What the hell is that? [PASSENGERS GASPING] Sit down! Shut up or be killed. Your choice. Ladies and gentlemen, I'm afraid your in-flight entertainment program... [OVER PA] ...has been canceled. The weapons being carried by my staff are real. So is their desire to use them if provoked. I am prepared to do whatever is necessary in order to achieve my goal. If you do as instructed, you will not be harmed. If you disobey or interfere with their activities... ...you will be shot. Oh, man. All right. All right. Oh, man, this is your idea of a surprise? Well, ha, ha, motherfucker. Very funny, Sly. You better be there. No, no, no. This can't be happening. Not now. Oh, man, first this Arsenio shit, then this-- Come on, come OH, come on. Hello, hello. Look, I got an emergency. My name is John Cutter. Cutter. Yes. I need Sly Delvecchio. I don't know how to spell his name. D-E-L-- Vecchio. - Gary has compiled those numbers and-- -There's a call for you on 24. Excuse me. - Who is it? -John Cutter. Oh, great. - Oh, shit. -Cutter, you there? Cutter? You! Back to your seat. Now! Oh, please, I don't wanna die! Please, don't shoot me! - I said, back to your seat! - Sweet Jesus. Our father who art in heaven. They've taken over the plane! Listen, Sly, I can't get-- - Get everybody for an emergency meeting. -Yeah, yeah. Sweet Jesus. They've taken over the plane! [G ROANS] [YELLING] [FLUSHING] [GRUNTING] How many? How many? Let's go say hello to your friends. All right, freeze! - Drop the fucking gun or your friend dies. -I have no friends. His name is John Cutter. He's airline security. Mr. Cutter, I'm sure your superiors would not like you to do anything rash... ...and risk the lives of all these wonderful people. Stand up! Move! [PASSENGERS GASP] Airline personnel assume a certain risk. It's part of the job. But these passengers, they're so innocent. - What do you want? -Oh, I have what I want. I have control of the plane and everything on it. Must I prove that to you? Sir, tell Mr. Cutter your name. Douglas. Cutter, meet Douglas. Let him go. Do you have any children, Douglas? A daughter. A family man. He has a daughter who loves him. And she, until your interference, had a father. [GUNSHOT] [PASSENGERS SCREAMING] - Oh, my God. -Aah! Now drop the fucking gun. [SCREAMS] [GUN CLATTERS] I loathe incompetence. Elevator. - Who are you? What are you doing? -Wait, wait. It's okay. There's always somebody down here. I just get paid to send food upstairs. Give me a break. All right. Right, right, right. Look, we got a hijack situation upstairs, okay? I need your help. Anything that you can do. VINCENT: Look, I'm not risking my life. You guys wanna fight terrorists, you're on your own. Give me a knife or a screwdriver or something. Okay, okay. I think we should do exactly what Mr. Rane wants. [G ROANS] [BOTH GRUNTING] CUTTER: Come on. [YELLS] Gotta go, gotta go. Find something to tie him up with. Look in the baggage area. Davis, notify the feds and alert Radar. I don't want that plane out of our sight. Mary, let me know the minute you make contact with the pilot. Notify ATC. Bring them up to speed on our situation. I want a list of everybody on that plane. I want it five minutes ago! Now, get to work! [SIGHS] MARTI: So, what's the plan? CUTTER: Make it to the avionics compartment. Once there, I can override the controls and bring the plane down. What? This is a jumbo jet! Yeah, I know, but we don't have any choice. Look, wasn't it you who said to do exactly as the terrorist tells you to do? He's not just a terrorist. - How are you gonna bring the plane down? -I'm gonna empty the fuel. [CUTTER GRUNTS] Are you out of your mind, Cutter? We could all crash. - Exactly. -I'm not letting you. - Come on. -it's too dangerous! You are certifiable! Lisa, I don't have time for this! Look, that man is one of the most dangerous terrorists in the world. He has killed two people. He will kill everybody else... ...if I don't figure out a way to bring him down. Look, I need your help. Please. Tell me you're good at this. I'm the best. Then do it. Charles Rane, the sophisticated British aristocrat... ...known internationally as the Rane of Terror. Linked to bombings in London and Northern Ireland. Because of ties to the Middle East, he's untouchable. Judging from the fact he killed his father... ...he was a pretty sick kid too. -What his old man did to him... ...didn't qualify him for father of the year. Hey, Delvecchio. You let the feds put a terrorist on one of my planes? - They didn't notify me. Here's his file. -They can do that? The FBI shows up at the last minute, they take what seats they need. - They don't have to tell us anything. -Jesus Christ. You'd think they'd put an airline hijacker on a bus or a train. SLY: Any word on why they were taking him to Los Angeles? ASSISTANT: He was supposed to stand trial for the Trans Pacific bombing last year. - Guess he had different plans. SLY: Yeah? He'll have to change them again. RAMSEY: Why is that? -Cutter is on that plane. What's the problem? We're losing fuel. One way or the other, we're going down. Then you'd better make preparations to land. Why are we going back there? It's easier to jump off the plane from the rear. What? It's easier to jump off the plane from the rear! Shit. ASSISTANT: Plane's losing altitude. Preparing to land. SLY: Well, where is it? -Outside Lake Lucille, Louisiana. The nearest airfield may not be large enough... ...but it may be their only choice. How fast can we get a chopper out there? A chopper? Why? - I want you there as quickly as possible. -On a helicopter? I don't want the FBI or some country local talking to the press... ...about something affecting this airline. Get out there and keep me informed. Right. COPILOT [OVER RADIO]: Atlantic International Flight 163. We're declaring an emergency. Request immediate authorization to land, over. Negative, 163. We're not a commercial airport. Suggest you reroute. Suggestion refused. Repeat, 163. We're not equipped to handle an aircraft your size. -It's too dangerous-- RANE [OVER RADIO]: Shut up and listen. It is too dangerous for you. See that the runway is cleared. Call Atlantic International. See what the hell is going on. And call the hospital too, just in case. Who's Lisa? What? Lisa. You called me Lisa in the avionics compartment. - She was my wife. -Was? She was with me when I tried to stop a robbery. I lived. I'm sorry. [PHONE RINGING] Plan not working out... [OVER PHONE] ...the way you wanted, asshole? Don't flatter yourself, Cutter. You prevented nothing. Although it seems I may have underestimated you. [OVER PHONE] Dumping the fuel was quite ingenious. At least Mr. Douglas' body won't have so far to fall now. Heh. Well, maybe Vincent could hitch a ride with him on his way down. You know, Charlie, I'm a little surprised at you. Didn't your father ever teach you never send a boy to do a man's job? Heh. Speaking of boys... ...our stewardess friend must be feeling particularly unsatisfied. - Charlie, you ever play roulette? -On occasion. Well, let me give you a word of advice: Always bet on black. PILOT [OVER RADIO]: Mr. Delvecchio, are you okay? Yeah. Could you please close the door? The door is closed, sir. Would you like us to fly higher? Might be smoother up there. Uh. Heh, heh. No, no, no. This is fine. This is fine. You better buckle in. The landing's gonna be rough. MARTI: Yeah. -Okay. [THUD] CUTTER: Hey, man, let me give you a hand. Biggest damn Cessna I ever saw. Get somebody out to the runway. I'm gonna be in the tower. Patrick, just do something, huh? COPILOT [OVER PA]: Fasten your seat belts. Brace yourselves for a short field landing. Flight attendants... ...please take your positions for an emergency landing. All right, listen up. The tower's gonna need as much assistance as they can get. You communicate with the airline staff, I'll coordinate rescue on the ground. Right, and how do we get down there? We step out. Gravity will do the rest. As soon as it stops, we jump. Cutter! Unh! [GRUNTS] [FORGET GROANS] [BOTH GRUNTING] MARTI: Stop! Cutter! Cutter! PILOT: Mr. Delvecchio, I've got Mr. Ramsey on the line. Oh. Well, I guess we can't tell him I stepped out, now, can we? Heh. Ah, put him through. Put him through. RAMSEY [OVER PHONE]: Delvecchio. -Yeah? I just had an idea about how to use Cutter. Use? If this works out, you're instructed to tell the press... ...that we had a security agent on the plane as part of our antiterrorist plan. If it doesn't work out, don't tell them anything about Cutter. I'll handle that. You understand? - Do you understand? -Yep. Yes, sir. Yes, sir. [MARTI GRUNTS] I had such wonderful plans for us. If she disobeys, kill her. Let me go! Stop it! Get your hands off me! [SIREN WAILING] On the ground! Facedown! Do it now! I'm security for the airlines. Yeah, and I'm the governor of Louisiana. Get your ass on the ground. Do it! CUTTER: I'm already on the ground, asshole. [CUTTER GRUNTING] Damn it! Look, you're making a mistake. My name is John Cutter. I'm security for the airlines. The plane has been hijacked. Come on! Come on! [CUTTER & EARL SHOUTING INDISTINCTLY] - Get the door open. -Damn it! The people on the plane are hostages. There are hostages on the plane! This is Chief Leonard Biggs, Lake Lucille Police Department. Tell me what you want, I'll tell you what I can deliver. RANE [OVER RADIO]: I want this plane fully fueled. If I do not see a fuel truck in position in the next five minutes... ...you will be responsible for a great many deaths. I'm not fully authorized to grant any demands at this time. Look out your window toward the plane, just in front of the landing gear. I've just executed five passengers. I'll execute five more every three minutes... ...until you find me someone who is authorized to meet my demands. Look, uh, I wanna help... ...but how do I know you won't kill the rest once I get you what you want? Get the truck near the plane. As soon as the fuel begins to flow, I will release half the passengers. You will be responsible for saving a hundred lives all by yourself. Look, I'll make some calls. Uh-- While you're on the phone, I'll be killing passengers. Let me know when I should stop. Now, wait, wait. Uh... Do we have an agreement? Fuel's on its way. Check and mate. Chief, shouldn't we wait for the FBI? Hell, no. I'm in charge till they get here. You heard that man, didn't you? I just saved a hundred lives. Let them damn federal boys see if they can do better than that, huh? ASSISTANT: Mr. Ramsey? -Yeah? Just got this on Rane. You're not gonna like it. No? Two years ago, Interpol thought they had him. Remember the bombings in London, the three train stations? Rane did it. He killed over 60 people. - Just to create a distraction. -Distraction? This guy has got a habit of blowing things up just to cover his escape. We've got over 200 passengers on that plane. - What do you think he wants? -Obvious, isn't it? The guy is facing the chair. He'll do whatever it takes to escape. I wouldn't be surprised if the son of a bitch blew up the plane... ...and then just disappeared in the flames. [SIREN WAILING] MAN: Can I have a hand over here? EARL: Shut up! Would you get him? He's a strong son of a bitch. - There's four of them. -Shut up! Chief, look, we caught him by the plane. Tried to attack us. If I tried to attack you, I wouldn't be the one bleeding. Mind telling me what you're doing on that airfield? My name is John Cutter. I'm the head of security for Atlantic International. I was a passenger before it was hijacked. Uh-huh, head of security. Ain't that a pickle? If you don't mind me saying, you ain't done too good a job. What is that fuel tank doing? I'm negotiating the release of 100 passengers. No! Chief, you can't trust him. The passengers are more valuable to him on the plane. No reason he'd let them off. - He needs fuel. -But he wouldn't trade the hostages. Don't you worry your ass about what he needs! Chief, he wants to talk to you again. This is Chief Biggs. The fuel is on its way like I promised. RANE [OVER RADIO]: And I, in turn, shall fulfill my end of the bargain. Chief, one of my men betrayed me and escaped from the plane. - Is that a fact? -Yes, a black man. Very smooth and convincing. I would prefer to deal with him directly for his cowardice... ...but should you find it necessary to inflict harm upon him... ...I will not hold you liable. The man in the plane says you're one of his. I know motherfuckers who say they saw Elvis in the mall. You gonna believe that shit too? Look, he's a murderer! Let me see some identification, Mr. Cutter. Here. Doesn't say head of security. Says you're some kind of instructor. Look, I'm the former head of security for Atlantic International. Put yourself in my place, Mr. Cutter. What would you do if you were me? Kill myself. Wait one hour before resuming the flight. That'll give me sufficient time to escape. Once the plane is back in the air, proceed with the plan. Let me go with you. I need you to stay on board and carry out my instructions. What if they don't give us clearance? Start killing passengers until they do. - Go on, move it! MAN 1: Don't push. FORGET: Get going, don't stop. Come on. MAN 2: Easy, easy. [GUNFIRE] [PASSENGERS SCREAMING] What the hell is wrong with those people? They're gonna trample each other to death. Damn it, chief. It's a trick. You gotta listen to me. I've had just about all the advice from you I'll take. Haul his ass downstairs. And if he gets cute, shoot him. In the leg. He might be telling the truth. Do me a favor, honey. Fix me a cup of that special coffee. Maybe a couple of Bufferin. Damn it, you're making a mistake! Shut up, boy! You ain't said shit I wanna hear. Let's go. [ALL GRUNTING] OFFICER: Hold it right there, buddy. [ENGINE STARTS] [MAN YELLS] [SIRENS WAILING] - Chief, prisoner got away. -No shit, Earl. Call for backup. I want somebody from every sheriff's department. He's headed toward the fairground. Want us to head out? Why? So he can get more practice whupping your dumb ass? Take extra men with you. Keep your guns in your holsters... ...unless that boy leaves you no other choice. Go! Come on. Come on. [MOTORCYCLE ENGINE ROARING] That won't be necessary, Vincent. I'll take care of Mr. Cutter. Secure transportation. Meet us at the other side of the fairground in 10 minutes. [SIREN WAILING] - Chief Biggs? Dwight Henderson, FBI. -Leonard Biggs, Lake Lucille Police. I'm gonna need a concise report on the status of this operation, chief. Make yourself comfortable. That airplane and my blood pressure ain't going a bit higher than it is right now. [CROWD CHATTERING] MAN 1: I'd like one popcorn. WOMAN 1: I'll have a popcorn. MAN 1: Thank you, sir. WOMAN 2: Hey! MAN 2: Hey, brother! Damn. HENDERSON: Flight 163, do you read me? Flight 163, come in, please. Flight 163, do you read me? Save your breath. They ain't gonna answer till they're ready. All we can do is sit and wait till we hear from them or our men in the field. Hope that Cutter fellow was telling the truth. - Cutter? -Yeah. - John Cutter? -Yeah. You know him? What happened to him? Well, he said he was on that plane. Beat up my men, headed out towards the fairgrounds. We'll catch him. Well, I hope you got a good early-retirement plan. Take Dean, Peale and Christopher. Get over to the fairgrounds. Chief, you better see to it your men don't harm Cutter. Because if he's hurt, I'll press charges against you myself. [UPBEAT COUNTRY MUSIC PLAYING] [CALLER SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY] CALLER: Get back home and swing your pretty little doll. Allemande left, right and left grand. Swing to the center, not too far. [GUNSHOT] [CROWD SCREAMING] MAN 1: Hey, where's he going? Move! MAN 2: Hey, turn it on so we can get down from here! Hey. [YELLING] WOMAN: What happened? Somebody do something. - Shit. MAN 3: Over here! [GUNSHOT] [BOTH GRUNTING] OFFICER: Freeze! Don't move! AGENT: FBI! Rane, you're under arrest! Let him go. Let him go. Get off me. Look, there's another one. He's 5'10"". He's got a tan jacket and blue, navy pants. Check him out. MAN 4: The whole world has gone mad. MEDIC: Hello, mayor. We've sent two people in. [SIRENS WAILING] Watch yourself. Watch it, ladies. Excuse me. Get him out of there. Cutter. Dwight Henderson, FBI. - Heard a great deal about you. -Pleasure's mutual. - You all right, man? -Yeah, I'm fine. SLY: John. -What the hell is wrong with you? You fucking put me on a plane with a goddamn terrorist? SLY: Nobody knew. The FBI didn't notify us. HENDERSON: Hold it. Those two agents you murdered on the plane were friends of mine. Thank you for telling me. I do enjoy knowing the people whose lives I've touched. You're gonna help us or I'm gonna rip your goddamn throat out. Oh, come on, now. While you're considering organ donations, it might be wise... ...to spare some thought for the remaining passengers on board. If I'm not released, you'll be clearing up their remains for quite some time. What are you talking about? My colleagues have instructions to start killing passengers in 20 minutes. Get this piece of shit inside. HENDERSON: I'll station some of my men behind the plane with tear gas and masks. Two agents will escort Rane up the boarding stairs. - You're gonna let him get back on? -That's what we'll tell him. - How are your sharpshooters? -The best. - They're not gonna get a second chance. -They won't need it. Sharpshooters? What about Rane's people that are still on the airplane? - Now, what about them? -Just be patient, okay? Look, I'm the only one who knows who they are. I can be wired. I can signal to Henderson's men when it's safe to shoot. We take out Rane first, okay? Will that give you time to use the tear gas? My men will start up the stairs as the first shots are fired. - We'll already have the door secured. -This sounds too crazy, John. it's... There's too much that can go wrong. Goddamn it, Sly! Listen. I saw him take a passenger on that plane. He asked him about his family. Then he blew his brains out all over the goddamn floor. Look, the longer we wait, the more people are gonna be sacrificed. - Fine. HENDERSON: All right. I'll go tell Rane. I'll make it look like he negotiated it. No. Let me tell him. Alone. Sure. John? You Okay? Yeah, I'm all right. Okay. [ENGINE STOPS] Mr. Cutter, how kind of you to pay me a visit. You've been a worthy adversary. It's a shame we won't be seeing much more of each other. Let me tell you something. If anybody else gets hurt on that plane... ...it's gonna take more than a prison cell to keep me from ripping your nuts off. I'd come to expect more from you than cheap vulgarities. You and I both know I will never see the inside of a prison. The notion of good over evil will not allow you to sit idly by... ...and watch the needless death of your fellow citizens. You know, Rane, you got a good point. Maybe I should just kill you right here. You wouldn't take advantage of a helpless man, would you? It's never stopped you. Ah. That's the American way, isn't it... ...brother? You should know. You're used to being taken advantage of. I want them off the plane. We share the same hunger. We're both killers. I know the breed, Cutter. [BOTH GRUNTING] I'm sick of your shit! You need the passengers. I want the plane. Put me back on board and the passengers will be released. - Right. I'm supposed to trust you? -Trust your instincts. My instincts are to wax your ass all over this floor. Those are your emotions acting without intellect. Now, the passengers' lives are in your hands. Don't fail them. Sit down. Why are you keeping us here? What do you want? For God's sake, let us go! MARTI: It's all right. It's all right. Don't give him a reason to hurt you. That's exactly what they want. Just try and remain calm. There we go. Everything's gonna be all right. All right? RANE [OVER RADIO]: Flight 163, this is Daddy. I will be rejoining you very shortly. If I'm not safely on board within five minutes... ...you are to continue as previously instructed. Gentlemen, I'm ready to leave your lovely little town. WOMAN [OVER RADIO]: 3-Adam-13, there's a possible 10-32, vicinity Montgomery Street. [WOMAN SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY OVER RADIO] Copy, over. All right. This is Cutter. Everybody in position? SHARPSHOOTER 1: Loud and clear. Target is well within range. Awaiting your command. That's a 10-4. Nobody does anything until I say "go." All right. All units, stand by. Now! Take him! Take him! [GUNSHOT] [GUNFIRE] [G ROANS] CUTTER: How is it'? -it's okay. - Okay, good. -it's all right. Get this plane off the ground. Move! AGENT 1: All right, move around! AGENT 2: Behind you! [GUNFIRE] Biggs, drive. - Where? CUTTER: Follow the fucking plane. FIREMAN: Hey, buddy, go ahead! Go! Go! [SIREN WAILING] RANE [OVER PA]: I hope you enjoyed your stopover. We'll now continue with the remainder of the flight. If you don't want to wear your seat belts, you don't have to. - What are we gonna do when we catch it? -You'll watch me sneak on the plane. - What? -I knew you were crazier than a June bug. Look, chief, I thought all you country biscuit-eating boys knew how to drive. Was that a bunch of bullshit or what? I ain't had a challenge like that since high school. I didn't know you went to high school. This better be covered by the health insurance. Yeah. It's under the section on mental illness. [LAUGHS] Bring it close to the landing gear. - I need a gun. -You need your head examined. I want this back in good condition. Belongs to my wife. Hey, John, bring your ass back alive, do you hear me? Miss the opportunity to get back at you? No way. Let's do it. SLY: Hey, John! Oh! John! I got a bad feeling about this. I got a bad feeling about this one. Oh, man! Aah! Approach Control, Lake Lucille. We have a hijacked aircraft. I want every radar station in the area following that plane. We're on it already. Do you read me, Approach Control? Mr. Forget, it's time to make the proper arrangements. Your friend Mr. Cutter has left you in a rather precarious position. Pour me a drink, Marti. What do you want? Anything wet. Did you enjoy yourself down there in the lower galley? You and your friend in that tight little place? Tell me, Marti. Did the hero get into your tight little place? You're repulsive. You'll change your mind once we get to know each other. You'll have to kill me first. No, Marti. I'm going to kill you during. [BOTH GRUNTING] [FORGET GROANS] [FORGET GROANS] It's almost time. What the hell is taking Forget so long? Maybe he's having difficulty finding the trunk. Idiot. ENGINEER: Who are you? Cutter. John Cutter. No, just chill out. I'm the good guy. - Where are they? -In the back. Can you turn this plane around and land at the airfield we just left? Hey, I did it once. - All right. Do it again. -You got it. Center, Atlantic International 163 with you. Something's wrong. Check the flight crew. - Why have you turned this plane? -We were told to head back. - By whom? CUTTER: By me. [GRUNTS] What a waste. All right. Keep that on her. If she moves, throw her out the window. - Hey, you need any help? -No, there's only one left. He's all mine. Open it. [SCREAMING] [BOTH GRUNTING] [SCREAMS] Oh, Shit! Shit! [DOOR CREAKING] [MARTI SCREAMING] [SCREAMING] [CUTTER LAUGHS] CUTTER [OVER RADIO]: Control Tower, this is John Cutter, Flight 163, do you read me? Loud and clear, John. What's your status? Single at the moment, but I am working on it. Cutter, this is Henderson. Have you disabled Rane yet? You damn skippy. ALL: Ha, ha. -All right, Cutter boy! CUTTER: Oh, hey, Biggs. How you doing? Is this you? In the flesh. That's a revolting thought. [ALL LAUGHING] EDWARDS: Ooh, ooh, ooh! ALL: Ooh, ooh, ooh! [SIREN WAILING] Hey there. Have you seen John Cutter? Yeah, he was with one of the flight attendants. Okay, thanks. Ahem. John. John. Hey. Tell Ramsey I'm taking a vacation. Done. - And I want a raise. -Done. - Ready to get out of here? -Where do you wanna go? Any place but here. SLY: What about these reporters? Hey, John, what am I supposed to do about these reporters? Hey, John, this isn't my bag. [CHUCKLES] [SIGHS] [REPORTERS CHATTERING] REPORTER: Are you a representative from the airline? That's right, and I'm pleased to report that our special antiterrorist program... ...which was enacted under my supervision... ...was an extraordinary success. REPORTER: What's your name? -Sly Delvecchio. BIGGS: Y'all riding or walking? CUTTER & MARTI: Walk. Five miles to town. No, thanks. Cutter, you didn't happen to see my wife's gun, did you? [MARTI LAUGHS] Good night, Cutter. Good night, Biggs. [English - US - SDH]
