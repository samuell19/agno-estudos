- Hi, this is Alayna. I can't come to the phone right now, but please leave a message. Hi, this is Alayna. I can't come to the phone right now- - Any luck? It just keeps going to voicemail. - This is Alayna we're talking about. She's the closing act for tonight's show. - Yeah, I know. - Maybe her phone isn't working. - You think so? I mean, it's not like Alayna to miss concerts. - You know she skipped school today, right? - Are you serious? - Yep. - Who'd she go with? - According to my resources, friend Darla and Jennifer. - Jennifer? - Yeah, that crazy punk rocker chick that nobody likes. - Okay, let me try her again. - Hello? - Alayna? It's Kara. Where are you? The concert's going to start in like 30 minutes, and Leslie's been looking for you to do some warmups and go over a plan. - I'm going to be there soon, but I'm in the middle of something right now. - What are you talking about? This is the biggest concert of the year! There's gonna be recruiters from all the colleges. - I know. - This is the moment you've been waiting for, the time for you to show off your new song. - Okay, well what time's my cue? I'm gonna try to be there on time. - 7:45. - Okay, I'll see you soon.

I'm just glad I don't have to get a ride from her every morning. - You do know what day it is today, don't you? - What? - Why, it's senior skip day. It's time to loosen up and meet some boys. - Yeah, I forgot about that. I don't think I can miss school. I have a choir performance, and there's no way I'm missing that recital. - Why not? - I'm doing the closing song for tonight's performance. This is a big deal for me. Don't mess it up. And I have to be at school in order to go to the concert. - Chill out. We're gonna go pick up Darla right now, and then we can stop by school so that you can sign into your first period. - I'm not even cool enough to go. Besides, the other girls really don't like me as much as you think they do. I'm just a school choir nerd. I'll probably make the whole day boring. Plus, I've never skipped school before. - It's gonna be so much fun, no matter what we do today. And no one's even gonna know you're not at school. I promise. - I need to check into my first period class so they don't count me absent. - No one's even gonna suspect that you're not at school. Come on. I have the car running. - Wait. I'm only in if you introduce me to Skip, the student body president's hottest guy. - Well, of course. Now come on. - Jennifer Cunningham! What do you think you're doing? What is that? - What's what? - What's going on here? - Oh! Pfft! Well, you see, I was fixing it, because the computer broke, and one of the circuits just totally flubbed on me, so I was fixing the computer 'cause it decided, the circuit decided to break, so I was fixing it. That's what I was doing. - Go have a seat. - I'm serious! The computer actually broke, and I'm really trying to fix it. - It's like the last time, when you phoned into the office and you called and you said aliens were attacking the football team. - That's different. I really thought that was happening, but somebody played a prank on me. - Go have a seat. - Darla, dear, are you ready to go to school? Mom, I told you I'm getting a ride from Bren. She's picking up in five minutes. - I need you to understand something. Those girls are losers. They will never amount to anything. You need friends that are pretty, like you are, ones who introduce you to guys, rich guys, like I have, men with money. - Stop, Mom. - You're a fashion model, and you only need what's good for you. - Mom, I really like hanging out with Bren. She stands up for me at school, and all of the girls are hating on me. - Just remember, you have an image to uphold, and I expect you to keep yourself professional. - I have to go. - Keep your chin up and cross your legs when you take a photo. - Have a good day, Mom. - Okay. - Hi, girls. - Hello. - Do you wanna sit in the front seat? - Stop it. No way. You can ride shotgun. So are you going to skip school with us today? - Yes, but only if you introduce me to Skip. - We will, don't worry. That is my specialty. - The motto of this school is maneat in schola, which, translated, means stay in school, which is appropriate on a day like today when so many young developing minds are actually tempted to skip school. Don't touch anything! - I was just trying to- - Stop! Playing pranks on people and messing with school property? That is not going to get you graduated. It's like the last time you got in trouble, you decided to go upstairs and flood the second story bathroom stalls, causing a major biochemical hazard, and it still smells in Ms. Sosa's classroom really bad. So now this is your last year. Let's try not to get into any more trouble. - But Principal Leigh, that one wasn't a prank. School restrooms are disgusting. I was testing out each toilet before I used it, and then I had to run out before the water levels got too high. - And this is why you're having trouble in school. You need to learn how to survive in the real world! I'm telling you, if you don't change any this year, I am not going to graduate you. Show me that you can do one good thing. Now get outta my office. Skedaddle. Go. Just go. Goodbye. - All right, girls. It's time to steal the trophy that I deserved.

Where are the rest of your retarded friends? - They're in the car. - You're not planning on doing senior skip day today, are you? - Yeah, actually we were. - Nobody wants to see a loser skip school, not even the students. - What's with the trophy? - Wouldn't you like to know? - Bye bye, loser. - Oh no. It's Jennifer, the school reject. - Please don't come over here. Please don't come over here. - Hey! - She sees us. - Hey. Oh. - Excuse me, Principal Leigh. - Yes, may I help you? I seem to be missing my first place cheerleading trophy we won last weekend. - Hey, watch it. That's my car. - I bet you thought I was gonna break this, huh? Well, not me. - No! - No! Idiot! - I can fix this. - No, I can fix that. - Of course you break the mirror, weirdo. - So, where are we going? - What are you doing in my car? - We're waiting for Alayna. Gosh. - I really hope the principal doesn't know that we're skipping. Oh no, she sees us. Duck! - Drive, drive, drive, drive, before the principal catches us! - What the heck? - Oh my gosh, oh my gosh, oh my gosh. - Calm down! - What up, loser? - Go, go, go, go, please! Skip Day! - Wow! That was close. - I knew we weren't gonna get caught. - So, Jennifer, right? - You know it. Woo! - So, what are you doing in the car with us? - Today's senior skip day! I wouldn't miss it for the entire world! - Right, but don't you have friends that you could skip with? I mean, we didn't really invite you. - Well, yeah, I've got lots of friends. I just choose not to hang out with them. - Oh, yeah, for sure. But where are they right now? - That's not important. I told you, I choose not to hang out with them. - Aren't you in my physics class? - Yeah. I am smart, you know? - Yeah, you're just not pretty. That's probably why you don't have friends. - Hopefully I get to meet Skip today. - I hope I meet a hot guy today. I think my stupid boyfriend's cheating on me. - I'm sorry, Darla, but I bet he is. - And if he does, he'll regret it when I become a big movie star one day. - Um, Jennifer, why are you skipping school today again? - Well, since I am a genius, I do need to take a break every once in a while. - Oh really? You need a break? - Yeah. - From what, yourself? And now you're gracing us with all your presence? - Okay, everyone. Let's just be nice, okay? - So where are we going? - I know what we should do! Let's go grab breakfast! - So whose house is this party at again? - It's at Pedro's house. - Pedro's cute. - Yeah. - Oh, Mr. Piggy, you don't understand how long I've been craving the touch of your sweet pork lips. - Are you all sure that she's okay? - Oh, oink, oink! Oink, oink! Make some bacon out of me, Mr. Piggy! Oink, oink! - She's just into weird stuff. - I don't know, but she does stuff like that all the time in physics class. - I don't know about your friend, Alayna. - Oh, shut up. - I just don't think we should have let her come with us. She's just gonna get us in trouble. - She's gonna be fine. Let's change the subject. Darla, when's your next fashion show? I saw that your mom was posting a bunch of new stuff. - Why does she always push the fashion show stuff anyway? - She wants me to grow up and marry a handsome man with lots of money, but I don't even know if I'm cut out for that. - Don't even worry about that. You have so much time to figure that out. Let's get the check. - Looks like we're here at the cool senior party. I'm scared to go in! - Don't be. This is gonna be fun. - Okay. - Are you excited to see Skip? - Yeah, but I'm sort of nervous. - So you like a dude named Skip? - Yeah. - His name is really Skip? - Yeah! - Sounds like a dog's name. - But he's so cute. - Yeah, well, my dog's cute, but I don't wanna date him. - Okay, Alayna, Jennifer and Darla, this is our senior skip day, okay? It only happens once, so we can't let this day just go by us without living it to the absolute fullest. It's gonna be the best day ever. Senior skip day will be one to remember. - The last party I went to, I got kicked out for drinking all the beer. - Sure it's not because of the way you were dressed? - Uh, Justin Bieber gave me this jacket at a Hollywood party, so. - Can I help you? Aren't you the girls that got milk poured on your heads at the homecoming dance? - Uh, let me handle this. - Do you really think we would let you losers into the cool senior skip day party? Besides, nobody even invited you all here. You all need to leave now. - Wait, wait, wait, wait. We know the secret password. Just, um... The password is, oh, one. Probably higher than you can count. - Really? You girls are a joke! - You know what? Just let us in before I kick your ass, okay? Pedro invited us over. - Whatever, losers. - Did you see what I got? It's because I earned it, not Coach Armstrong. It was me. I finished in the final top score. - Sure. - Looks like they invited everyone to the party. - I invited Bren yesterday 'cause we got Spanish class. She's cool. I don't know about her other friends, but it's good. - Weirdos. Am I right? - Yeah, it's whatever. - This is sick. - Wow. Oh, they're doing shots! I'll be back. - I'm gonna take this call. - Okay. - Thank you for bringing me here. - You're gonna have so much fun. You'll see. - Look. There's Skip. - See? I told you that he'd be here. Do you want me to break the ice? - Can you? - Of course I can. Come on. Skip, hi. - Hey. - I don't know if you remember me from history class, but my name's Bren, this is Alayna. - Yeah, Bren, I remember you. And Alayna, yeah, you look familiar. - Glad we can formally meet. - I'm gonna head out for a second. - Okay. - You sing in the school choir. I love to hear y'all sing. - As a matter of fact, we have a choir recital tonight. Maybe you could come. - Yeah. - Yo, Skip! Hey, we are gonna do some shots out back! You should totally join us. - Okay. I'll be right there. - Sounds good. - I guess I gotta go. Oh, yeah, give me your number. I'll text you an address later in the day. My sister's having a party at my house at 2:00 p.m., but it's for college kids only. If you bring a bottle of vodka, I'll make sure that they let you and your friends in. Those are my sister's rules. - Sounds good. - Cool. See you there? Awesome. Hey, wait up! - Yes! - Hey, did you hear about that party later today? - Well, three's a crowd, two's company, am I right? - Weirdo. - Mm-mm. - What did he do this time? See, I knew he was bad for you. - Tommy just told me he found another girl. - Darla, I'm so sorry. But you know what? You're gonna find another guy, okay? I promise. - I just met the guy I'm going to marry, but he's right over there, so shh. - See, I told you you could do it. That's great. - What happened? Did I miss something? - No, it's just her stupid boyfriend just called it quits. - Let me just check in with my mom, okay? - Seriously, chillax a little bit. It's our senior skip day, and you wanna call your mom? Let's just have fun today. - Look, let me just give her a text, okay? I always check in with her during lunchtime. - I'm so excited to go to another party! - Awesome. - There you guys are! I was just hanging out with some really cool people over there. I don't know if you've ever met... Oh gosh. Oh, me, myself, and I. - Well, we were just hanging out with the cool people from the party. - Meeting guys and stuff. - Come on. Where's Jennifer? thought she was right behind us. - I think she went to the bathroom as we were walking out. I think she's gross. I literally cannot stand her. I hate the way she dresses. - Not everyone can be like you, fashion model princess. - Screw you. - Screw me? Why do you have to insult me now? It's not her fault she likes punk rock. It's her style. Get over it. - You get over it. Okay, we're all pretty. Just don't argue. - Go! - What did you just do? No. - Just drive. - Those losers stole my trophy! They're gonna pay for this. Girls, gimme some salt! Those girls are dead meat! - Why do you have that trophy in your hand? That's the one that Italy had. - I stole it. - Why? - Because Italy stole it from cheer coach Armstrong. I'm just returning it. - And since when are you the hero? I have to do one good deed before the year is up in order to graduate. That's what principal Leigh told me, so here it is. - Jeez, Jennifer, you're crazy. - Plus, I hate Italy. She's a bully, and I hate her. - Well great! Because now we're going to get our asses kicked. - No. You're gonna get your kicked for sure. - Who's the best? You're the best. Yeah, you're the best. - So what's next? - Well, we could be in third period right now. That would suck. - Let's go shopping! Darla, you already said that, remember? - I know, I know, but it's my favorite place to be. - Let's go play miniature golfing! - How about let's go back to the party. - How about not. Is that a joke? - Can I drive your car? - Okay, fine.

I thought I would've met someone today, but who knows? - Your last boyfriend was kind of a jerk. He hung out with those like skater guys. - But I like those skater guys. They remind me of how I wanna dress. My mom's always pushing me to dress up. - For the record, I really like Skip. He's like the one for me. - We know. - So Jennifer, who's your love interest? - Don't have one. Boys are gross. - So you don't like guys? - That's not it. - It's just I haven't found the right one for me. - Well maybe if you dressed nicely, then you would. - Oh no. We're in trouble now. - Here we are again. My three retarded school nerds and their choir captain. Where's my cheerleading trophy? Where is it? I want my cheerleading trophy now! - Hey, how are we supposed to know? I mean, we're not the ones who stole it from the cheer coach's office. - Give it to me. - I don't have it. - You know, it's probably where you left it last. - You think this is funny? I worked my butt off for that trophy. Now where is it? - We've never seen it before. - You want my friends and I to kick your butts and shake it out of you? - Things get lost and, gosh, people lose things all the time. And, oh, it's especially prevalent in dumb bimbos. - Why do you think we stole your trophy? - You're gonna wish you never messed with me, choir nerd. - Go, go, go! Let's go! - What the hell is going on? I told you not to steal that trophy! - Where are they going? - Messing with people's fun, right? - We need to get back to school before we get into more trouble. Oh my gosh. - I want my trophy! What are we gonna do? - We're gonna lose 'em, that's what. - That was awesome! Yeah! - That was the best ever! - I don't sees on them. - Keep your eyes on them, ladies. - There they are. - Come and get us. - They mess with the wrong cheerleader. You're going down, choir nerds! - Losers! - We beat you, suckers! - You're going, choir nerd! - Old lady crossing the street! - Look out! - Que pasa! - We beat you, suckers! - That was so close! - We had 'em the whole time! - Thanks to my driving. - Man, I am so hyped right now! This is like that time my dad took me to the Cannonball cross-country race. with millionaires and socialites. - Well, we did it. - Guys, the college party starts at 2:00 p.m. - I know. Skip is going to be there, and I'm super excited. But there's just one problem. - What's that? - We need a bottle of liquor to get in. It's Skip's sister's college party, and that's the only way they'll let us high schoolers go. - I think my mom has booze at her liquor bar in my house. - Darla's house we go. - I don't think anybody is home. My mom's car's gone. - That's great. Come on. - Where's the booze? Check the counter. - Can I have one of these gummy bears? Yeah, just take whatever you want. Take the whole bottle. - Looks like there's no alcohol. Except for in the trash. Where's your bathroom? - Down the hall. - What was that? It sounded like a car. - Darla, are you expecting company? - No, why? - Looks like you have some now. - Oh no. My mom is home. Let's go hide in my room. - So what are we gonna do? - I don't know. - Shh! Why don't we just go through the window? - Now we're never gonna get to that party. - Wait, guys. I know where we can get alcohol. - Where are we going? - What? This isn't enough to get us into the party? - No, Jennifer. It's just that we need real liquor so that we don't walk in looking like idiots. I think I know a liquor store where we can get some. - What do you know about buying alcohol? - You don't know everything about me. - It's because she hangs out with all the cool kids. - Ha ha. No, it's just that they let teenagers into this liquor store because they sell chips and soda. We should go check it out. - Wait, can we turn this up? - I love this song. - You know this song? - Everybody knows this song. ♪ I was always thinking I should be all alone ♪ ♪ Not realizing that my heart was turning to stone ♪ ♪ You never walked away ♪ ♪ You never turned your back on me ♪ ♪ You took me by the hand ♪ ♪ You showed me how to set me free ♪ ♪ I always thinking I should be missing out ♪ ♪ Not realizing that my soul wants to scream and shout ♪ ♪ You never walked away ♪ ♪ You never turned your back on me ♪ ♪ You took me by the hand ♪ ♪ You me showed me how to set me free ♪ - You really think this is gonna work? - I'm a pro.

It's just enough to get into the party. - Let's go inside. - Look over there. It's our four retards. - The cops are gonna catch us for sure. - Oh yeah? Let's call Principal Leigh and leave an anonymous message. Hello? Principal Leigh por favor. I just happened to be passing by the liquor store on the corner of Vance Jackson and 410 and I noticed it looks like four of your students are taking advantage of senior skip day. I always say maneat in schola, stay in school. - Guys, we're gonna get in huge trouble. My dad once got arrested for doing something like this. - What are you kids doing in my store? - Uh, looking. - What the hell do you want? - Oh, we would like to to buy your- - Speak up! - We would like to buy your cheapest pinto of vodka please! - Pint of our cheapest vodka? That's it? Is that it? - Yep. That's the one. - Do you want to taste it first? - Mm-mm. - Are you girls old enough? I don't believe you! Let me see your ID. - Show her the ID, Jennifer. - Yes, the ID. Ah, the ID that I have in my pocket. Yep. - Jennifer, the ID. - Yeah, okay, I'm getting it. Oh, here it is. - Hm. Get outta here before I call the cops on you! - Oh, no. - Surprise! I just got an anonymous phone call that you all were here. You're in a lot of trouble. You're gonna spend the rest of the day in ISS. Oh, that's in school suspension for skippers, because you're a skipper, you're a skipper, you're a skipper, and you, you're on your way outta here, so let's go! - If you have a contraband, I want you to leave it right here.

I bet you too. - Yup. - Ladies, just make sure you come back after you're done. - I can't wait to graduate and get to go to college. Don't your parents get on your nerves? - Not really. My parents don't really care about me. - I'm so excited to get to go and live in a dorm room and finally be by myself for once. - You've got it lucky, Bren. My mom is a monster. - Would you say that your home life sucks? - It doesn't suck. It's just something I don't want to do. - My home life is awesome. My dad cooks for me every night and takes me exotic places around the world, so. - Come on. Can I tell you guys something? - Sure. - I don't really know what's gonna happen after today. - What do you mean? - You wanna know the real reason why I skipped school today? I found out today that my parents are getting divorced. - Bren, I'm so sorry. - I don't even know where I'm gonna finish out the year. My dad wants me to move out with him, and my mom wants me to stay here with her. What do they expect me to say? It's like my last normal day hanging out with my friends, you know? - I know how you feel. My parents don't really care about me either. - You're a brat! You have it so good, and you don't even know it! - Hey! - I can't even breathe without my mom telling me how I'm doing it wrong. The other day I had an eyelash out of place, and she practically slapped me to fix it. And then she took me to an audition the next morning, because she said I was getting fat. She says it's for my own good, but I just wanna be a normal girl. - Screw you! Every girl in this school wants to be you, and every boy wants to be with you! - You know what? She's right. I wish I were you. At least your mom cares about you. My parents are just rich and don't care. - But you're so cool. - I think I just get what I want because I've been doing this my whole life. I've tried getting into trouble. I've tried being the good girl. Nothing's good enough for them. They just don't care. - Well, my dad has all the money in the world, so he travels with me everywhere. - You're such a liar, Jennifer. I've known you since the second grade, and I've never even seen your dad. Does he even pick you up from school? - Hang on. Why did you even skip school today? - You really wanna know? - No lies. - No lies? - Tell me the truth. - I skipped school because I had nothing better to do. I mean, do I look like I have friends? People are scared of me. Nobody wants to hang out with a punk rocker. I don't look like them. I don't wear the same clothes as them. I don't act like them. You know what my dad actually does for a living? - What? - He's a janitor at John H. Bueller High School. - Why did you lie about him taking you to all these places? - You wanna know why? My dad wanted to play pro football, and then he found out I was on the way, and it was a huge surprise for him, and he was gonna be the proud dad of a son like he always wanted. But he didn't have a son. He had a little girl. I hate myself. - Well I think you're pretty cool. - Yeah. - You're actually really funny. - Thanks. This is all so stupid. I know it's not gonna matter once I leave this stupid school. So what about you? - Well, I guess I've had it pretty easy. Wanna know something? I've never even been kissed. Bren, you're so cool and independent that I admire you. You're like a big sister to me, family. And Darla, you're so pretty, but not just because of your looks but because of who you are inside. And Jennifer, I really like your stories. I totally believe that you went to Mount Everest and you got your jacket from Justin Bieber, and maybe your dad is a rich man who takes you to exotic places. - Thanks. So what about you? Why did you skip today? Because I just wanted to get a boyfriend before I graduate. - Speaking of which, we've gotta get you to that last party. If only we could get past the ISS teacher. - What's so funny? - I gave him those sleepy time gummy bears. He ate the whole bottle. He's not waking up till tomorrow morning. - Come on, guys, let's go to my house. We need change for that college party. - What are we gonna do about the alcohol we need to bring? - We're gonna have to go with this. I hope it works. - Whoa. Hi! Alayna, you look great. - Thank you, Skip. You don't look so bad yourself. - Oh. - We brought the bottle of vodka. - Oh, sweet. Yeah, my sister will be super happy about that. Come in, please. So where are you going to college next year? - Hopefully South Texas State. - Oh, I hear they have really cool sororities there. I hope to join a fraternity when I get into college. You know, you're really cool. I'm really glad I got to formally meet you. - Thanks. So, you're coming to my choir recital tonight, right? - Yeah. - All right, ladies. You ready for this? - Yes. - Yes. - Thank you. - Mm-hm. - Hey. Oh. - Hey, loser. What are you doing here? And where's my trophy? - In a safe place. - All right, ladies, let's drink up before we kick this moron's ass. - I really don't think you should drink- - Shut up, loser! - You do know that's toilet water, right? - What the hell? - You little shit! - Hello? - Alayna? It's Kara. Where are you? The concert's going to start in like 30 minutes, a and Leslie's been looking for you to do some warmups and go over a plan. - I'm going to be there soon, but I'm in the middle of something right now. - What are you talking about? This is the biggest concert of the year. There's gonna be recruiters from all the colleges. - I know. - This is the moment you've been waiting for, the time for you to show off your new song. - Okay, well what time's my cue? I'm gonna try to be there in time. - 7:45. - Okay, I'll see you soon. I need to kick someone's ass right now. - Stop it, Italy. - Italy, what do you want? - You know what I want. I want my trophy you stole. - Uh, no, you stole it first. I'm just returning it. - So what if I stole it? I deserve it anyway. And you girls should have never taken it for me. - Nobody cares about your stupid trophy. I'm sick and tired of you messing with me and my friends, and this is gonna be the last time you do. Senior year is about to be over, and you losers think you can beat me? - We don't need someone in my life like you. - Hey, stop it. - What are you gonna do, choir nerd, sing me a little song? - Alayna! ♪ Twinkle twinkle little star ♪ ♪ How I wonder what you are ♪ ♪ Up above the world so high ♪ ♪ Like a diamond in this sky ♪ ♪ Twinkle twinkle little star ♪ ♪ How I wonder what you are ♪ - Okay, guys, let's go. - Okay, I'm gonna go up on the stage. You guys go sit in the audience. - Thank you. It was beautiful. Thank you. Thank you so much. - Can you plug my phone in and play this track? - Thank you so much for coming out to our program this evening. We all worked really hard. We have such talent in our school. - Principal Leigh! Principal Leigh! Principal Leigh, I... I have the trophy that Italy stole from you. - Well, why, thank you, Jennifer. This is one of our best students. She's so good and she helps everyone. And thank you, Jennifer, for bringing back the cheerleader trophy. - And you're gonna graduate me this year. - No. - One good thing. - And she'll be graduating this year. - There she is! That's the one who sold the trophy! Not me, her! - Of course I did! It's my trophy! I earned it! - Italy, I'd like to have a word with you and your two friends. - Oh no. - Hi, everyone. My name is Alayna, and I am a choir nerd. I skipped school today, and I learned a lot of things with my three friends. You know when you don't really know what the future will look like, but you kind of know that everything's gonna be fine? Well, today was one of those days. - I was supposed to sing my final song for the recital tonight, because this is my senior year. But you know what? It is not the end of our senior year. It's the beginning of a new year for all of my new friends, old, near, and far. And I wanna dedicate this song to my three best friends. Thanks for being with me today. I had an awesome time. And now... they are going to sing with me. - We'll do our best. - I learned a ton of new stuff today. Just because you're the prettiest girl in school does not mean you don't have insecurities. And even the toughest girls have problems. And even the weirdest out of all of us have a heart. - Hit it, Kara. ♪ I was always thinking that I can do this all alone ♪ ♪ While realizing that my heart was turning to stone ♪ ♪ You never walked away ♪ ♪ You never turned your back on me ♪ ♪ You took me by the hand ♪ ♪ You showed me how to set me free ♪ ♪ I was always thinking I should be missing out ♪ ♪ While realizing that my soul wants to scream and shout ♪ ♪ You never walked away ♪ ♪ You never turned your back on me ♪ ♪ You took me by the hand ♪ ♪ You me showed me how to set me free ♪ ♪ I finally see the signs of what's been on the line ♪ ♪ I will do anything just about anything just for you ♪ ♪ With a friend like you ♪ ♪ There's just about nothing that I can't do ♪ ♪ So I realize that this is the time to be on my way ♪ ♪ To letting go and leave behind that dreadful day ♪ ♪ You never backed away ♪ ♪ You showed me what was right and wrong ♪ ♪ You showed me how to fight ♪ ♪ And that I can be on my own ♪ ♪ I finally see the signs of what's been on the line ♪ ♪ I finally see the signs and I won't forget this time ♪ ♪ That I will do anything just about anything just for you ♪ ♪ With a friend like you ♪ ♪ There's just about nothing that I can't do ♪ ♪ I will do anything ♪ ♪ Just about anything just for you ♪ ♪ I will do anything just about anything just for you ♪ ♪ Just for you ♪ ♪ With a friend like you ♪ ♪ There's just about nothing that I can't do ♪ ♪ I can't do ♪ ♪ I will do anything just about anything just for you ♪ ♪ Just for you ♪ ♪ With a friend like you ♪ ♪ There's just about nothing that I won't do ♪ ♪ I won't do ♪ - What on earth are you wearing? - Mom, I don't care anymore. - Young lady, don't start. - I just want to be me. - You're going to ruin your shot to be a top model. - Mom, I don't wanna be like you.

It's so windy out here. It's like we're in Australia something, where it's really windy. - Australia? - It's crazy. - Reset. - Such a doll face, that Gabby. She's so silly sometimes. - So I'll just kind of turn around and notice that, Kellyn. - She's just being silly. I look like you're about to look back.
