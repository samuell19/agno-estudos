LIPID-LOWERING CAPSULE PAIN ELIMINATING PLASTER MR. LIU Grandma. Grandma. Grandma! Grandma. Grandma. Grandma. Xixi, what's the matter with you? Do you play me for a fool? I called you and texted you on WeChat every single day, you don't answer my calls or reply to my texts. What are you doing? Xixi. I'm sorry. I was a bit agitated in my speech. It's just that I missed you so much. JIANREN What is it? This isn't working. You should do it. Her body has gotten stiff. JIANREN San, quite a haircut you got there. My head looks like your dad's. What are you talking about? I am your dad! Hot water. Towel. Don't touch my grandma! - Don't touch my grandma! - What are you doing? Don't touch her! Don't touch my grandma! Let me down! Don't touch my grandma! - Don't touch my grandma! Let me down! - The topic of my speech is - "I Love My Home". - Look after your sister, Xiaowu. Let me out of here! Feet widened, shoes donned, on the main road you go, may you cross the Bridge of Forgetfulness safely. -It's 10 a.m. in Chunhui Hall, -Go to heaven - and return to your rightful place. - Qingtian Funeral Parlor. - Mr. Liu is coming. - Bless your children - Get there early to find a parking spot. - with riches. Seriously. Your mom just has to pick this time to go. As if we weren't busy enough already. Can't we postpone the mourning until tomorrow? I want to keep her here for an extra day. I don't think we can cancel today's tickets to Beijing. - I'm not going. - Since when do you have a say in this? I'm warning you. This is a once-in-a-lifetime chance for our son. Even if you spend a few more days with her, she's gone anyway. How about this? Let's just be with her a little while longer, okay? Stop there! Where's the ancestral gold ring on your mom's finger? What are you implying? Do you dare steal from the dead? Are you not afraid of karma? - What are you talking about? - Stealing? - I didn't steal it. - Stop talking nonsense. We didn't steal anything. Then how will you prove that you're innocent? See? We didn't steal it. The ring is tiny. You could've hidden it anywhere. Search me then. Search me. Search. Pervert! Don't run away! Don't make false accusations unless you catch him red-handed. This is San. He just got out of prison. I see that your mouths are running loose. Why don't I tighten them up for you? San. The van from the crematorium is here. Shall we go? I'm done with this job. We're not even paid yet. Mom. Have a safe journey to the next world! Rise. Your grandma is in that big box over there. Mom. She's being taken to the crematorium where she'll be burnt to ash and buried in a grave. Rubbish! I'll tear that blabbering mouth off your face! She's dead and you'll never see her again. Don't you dare say that! Drive slowly. UP SKY San, another one gone. Sooner or later, I will make you gone as well. Take this. Good stuff. A whole pack next time. Can't you park your van somewhere else? Build some good karma. My van, my own doorstep. It's none of your business. You're in the funeral business. With your van in front of my wedding shop, how will we attract customers? Xiaopang, come here. This is for dead people. Go wash your hands. Yes, listen to your mom and remember to use boiling water. Otherwise, your hands will rot. You should wash that mouth of yours. Just park your van further away. And why should I do that? Who do you think you are? Have a peach. Sir, have a peach. You make the days go by like tasteless porridge. Somehow, you've managed a whole year. I shall keep my promise. The store is yours. Our business... The capable one looks down on it, the weak one can't stand it. The three books of work notes are written by your grandpa, me, and your older brother. Learn from them and carry on our legacy. Make notes with each deceased we send off. I will inspect the books regularly. Sure, Dad. I got it. Now kneel and pay respects to your granddad and your brother. My big sister, this isn't necessary, right? Just do it. Kneel. Hurry up. Grandpa, here's your grandson's kowtow. Why don't we skip the one for my brother? I've never even known him. Put that down. I'll do it in his name. Here's one for his grandpa. Here's another one for his older brother. Done. Take your ID card and go change this property's ownership. I can wait. Let's do the transfer tomorrow. Where is this? I have a picture. Follow this road. It's over there. Remember now? That way. Thank you, ma'am. Open the door. Open the door. Open up. I can hear your ringtone. Open up! What are you doing here? Why are you closed? Didn't I text you? We're broken up. Believe me or not. I'd smash my way in if you don't open the door right now. I got the ownership of my dad's house. You get out! What's your stupid house have to do with me? Didn't you always want to join a big maternal and child goods brand? I can help you with that. Don't you know? I've waited for over two months. - I can't wait any longer. - Get out. It's your turn to shower. Laoliu, Sanmei, you're here. We just changed the bedsheet and you've messed it all up. You! I... Laoliu, let go! Dear wife, he was the first to get physical. Release me. Let him go. I'm pregnant! I'm pregnant! The baby is his. I fought him over you. That's how I went to jail. I just want to get married, have a child, a home, and someone to rely on. - What's wrong with that? - What makes you think I can't - give you a home? - With what? I just don't see you being mature. I don't see you being a good dad. Sanmei, you should take this money. See it as our way of making it up to you. It was you. You're the last person who touched my grandma. Where did you take my grandma? What's wrong with you? Where did you take my grandma? - Enough. - Where is she? - To the crematorium! Where else? - Where is my grandma? What kind of childhood did you have? The crematorium was my childhood. - You give me my grandma back! - It's okay. I'm really not in the mood for this. Take her away now. - Give me my grandma back! - I have informed her parents. - They'll be here soon. - Let me go. I'll play a cartoon for you, okay? How about an ice cream? We are so sorry to have bothered you. Some parents you are. You let your child loose like this. - Yes. Xiaowen, let's go. - I'm not going. - Come with me. - I'm not going. - I'm not. - What are you doing? - Xiaowen. - I'm not going. Now. Go home. I'm not! That's too much. Come on, Xiaowen. - Xiaowen. - I'm not going home! - Xiaowen! - I'm not! - Go home! - I'm not! - Come on. Let's go. - I'm not! Your grandma is in the room. Go and look for her. Grandma? Your grandma is not here. Let me go! Let me go! Stop biting me. - Stop! - I'll hit you! - Stop! - Stop! - Let's go. - Put me down. Such a biter. You're a dog, aren't you? You jerk! I want my grandma back. Let me go. I'm telling you. Let me go. I see that you own the property now. Why don't you transfer the ownership to me? We'll join our strengths in the wedding business. You'll still be the boss and I'll give you 15%. Stop annoying me, will you? Your family needs to change your ways. Always dealing with the dead is bad for feng shui. Look. Your dad lost a son in his middle age. Your sister is married but spent half her life alone. Then look at you. You're in your thirties now. You struggled so much to get a girlfriend and probably won't even marry her. What the heck is wrong with you? Get off. - It's only a business proposal. - Get off. San, it's better to send people to wedding beds than heaven. - Be assured. We'll be back again. - I'll be waiting. Fine. Take care. - Thank you. Bye. - I'll reserve the wedding gown for you. - Take care. - Xiaopang, let's go eat a watermelon. DAPANG WEDDING SHOP Rain shall pour from the sky, widows shall get remarried, and you should think about changing professions. I'm sick of spending my days like this. I'm going to change the way I live. San, I know your mind is worried about something. Why don't you tell us and we'll see how we can help? What could be bothering my mind? How about being accused of stealing? Getting cheated on by your ex? And the guy she dumped you for being richer than you? Or others saying that you make a living off the dead? Or you're inferiority complex because you've been to prison? Are you trying to cheer me up or piss me off? I'm taking down the shop sign now. In short, you have an attitude problem. No one's history is spotlessly clean. I was a thief and she was an illegal street trader. If you're sickened, we should just give up our lives. Then I'll kill myself, are you happy? Will killing yourself solve your problems? The reason you find life so hard is because you constantly look down on yourself. - Why are you arguing with me? - You look down on yourself. How can others look up to you? Get up. Get the hell up. Get the hell up now. Give me my grandma back. - Let me go! - Get out now! - Get out! - Let me go! Are you leaving or not? Just go! I don't have time for this. She bit me. Xiaowen, I will take you to Beijing to have some fun, okay? I'm not going anywhere. I want to find my grandma. Your grandma is... What on earth is taking you so long? We'll miss our flight. I know, but what can I do if she won't leave? Listen. If our son misses anything, you won't hear the end of it. - Hurry! - Stop shouting at me. I'll find a way. Sir, could you please open the trunk? Sir, do you think this will work? Can you look after this kid for three days? Absolutely not. This is for the trouble. Maybe there is a way. I said no. No way. This is a graveclothes store, not an orphanage. You have no childhood and there's no empathy in you either. Are you coming or not? I'm coming. - Can't you see? They're in such a hurry. - Please. - Xiaowen, be good. - Hurry up! - No problem. - Hurry up. Take care. What's the matter with you? Do you have a problem with money? Come out now. You can stay here. Come. Are you sure you can handle this little devil? Come on out. Have a hot shower, so you don't catch a cold. It's just three days with a kid. How hard can it be? Give me my grandma back. Eat. No garlic? What? Grandma used to say a noodle without garlic tastes only half as good. Have you not been eating in the last few days? Don't your parents look after you? I have no mom and dad. How did you get here anyway? I took a picture, showed it to people, and they showed me the way. Grandma used to say the road is right under the nose. Let's play a game. - Hide and seek. - I'm not interested. Then what kind of game did you play with your grandma? Mahjong. Come on. How big are the bets? You stole your grandma's ring. I didn't steal it. She gave it to me. You mustn't let my uncle know. Put that away. A child shouldn't gamble with money. TO BRING IN WEALTH AND TREASURE Four bamboos. Pong. East wind. Are we going to keep playing this one game until daybreak? I win. Same color, three sequences. Five cracks makes the winning tile. Another game. My grandma said quit while you're ahead. It's bedtime. Is yours human or goat piss? It's such a horrible stink. If you want to wee, go to the toilet, bathroom, or restroom. Your grandma taught you so many things. Don't you know something so basic? Why are you shouting at a child in the middle of the night? I haven't wet the bed in a long time. It's just that I'm afraid to go to your bathroom. What's so scary about my bathroom? It's fine. These are all made of paper. Like that ugly tiger of yours. They are all fake. She has a name, Beans. My grandma made it. They have names too. The boy is called Cucumber. The girl is called Aubergine. They are the same. Don't be scared. Let's go back to bed. I'm tired. Let's sleep now. Where am I supposed to sleep then? Hello. Sanmei, Dad and I are waiting in the hall for the transfer. Take the ownership certificate and come. All the important information is being washed off. I'm afraid we can't proceed with the transfer. How many days will it take to get a new one? First, you need to make a statement explaining the loss and it takes at least a month. There's no need to be so dogmatic about this. A dad is giving a house to his son. Does it need to be this hard? Why can't you wait a month then? Are you planning on something? Relax. What could I possibly be planning? Hello. What are you doing at the hospital? I've been very clear about this. I'm closing the business. I'm done. Stop going against everything I want, will you? I think it's you who's going against - me all the time. - What are you doing? What are you doing? It hurts. The house is for you to do business. Don't you dare close up the shop without my say-so. Sanmei. I'm watching you. Where is my grandma? You promised me. When I wake up, you'd take me to find my grandma. Liar. We are the... I was here first. My condolences. You people have been waiting outside even when my girl is still alive. The doctor just pronounced her dead and you're onto me like crazed, starving dogs. Do you not have kids of your own? Build some good karma. Is it a little girl? She has been sick for over a year. She's probably died of heart failure. Hello. Listen. The old man is really fed up this time. Behave yourself if you still want the house. I didn't do it on purpose. Where is my grandma? Stop bothering me, will you? I'll take you to find your grandma if you listen to what I say. Do you hear me? You guys really don't know when to quit, do you? Sir. May I borrow a minute of your time, please? I just saw you over there in the hallway telling them off. I want to tell you that I understand. I really do. However, there has to be someone to help you with the child's funeral arrangements. At a time like this, everyone in the family must stay strong. This is my daughter. My wife is never happy with the fact that I'm poor, so she ran off with a man who owns a maternal goods store. So I have to bring my daughter along when working. If you think I'm trustworthy, please allow me to make the arrangements. I'm not doing this for profit. It's like what you said. Good karma for my daughter. It will be cremated early tomorrow morning, so it's urgent. I'm leaving the paperwork to you. Wait. What are you doing? I'm taking a photo of this contract and sending it to my dad to cheer him up a little. QINGTIAN FUNERAL PARLOR QINGTIAN FUNERAL PARLOR Go. Shut up and don't move. Remember. FUNERAL FUNERAL Your grandma is in that big box over there. She's being taken to the crematorium where she'll be burnt to ash. Have a safe trip to heaven. Rest in peace. All attendance, it's time for the three ceremonial bows. The first bow. The second bow. Rise. Where is my grandma? My grandma is inside this big box! - How come there's a child? - Isn't she yours? Did you burn my grandma as well? Get out. Give me my grandma back! Give me my grandma back! Where is my grandma? Give me my grandma back! Give me my grandma back! Of course. Of course. Rest assured, sir. I will carry it out to the letter. You two, remember to... Remember to pay the fines later. You brought a child into this place and let her create a scene at someone else's funeral. I don't even know this girl. She's the daughter of a friend. Then you're letting your friend down. You're letting your dad down. You're letting your sister... By the way, how is your sister? Don't mention her, please. You two divorced. Why bring her up? It was all because of you. Pay the fine or your van won't be allowed in the funeral parlor. What now? Were you sent by god to destroy my life? Perhaps you don't think my life is bad enough. Go ahead and poke some more. Stab me to death. I don't want to live anymore. Just stab me. I thought my grandma was in that big box. Grandma. It's always her. Come. Get down. Do you see that big chimney over there? You grandma was burnt, turned to ash and smoke, drifted up into the sky, and disappeared. You won't see her again. Do you understand? Do you understand now? Grandma. Grandma. Your grandma is not gone. She just went to another world. She was burnt and became ashes. Even if she's burned to ash, it's not the same as disappearing. It floats in the sky, right? Right? Yes. It went up into the sky and became a star. She became a star, yes. San. This is the stuff you asked for. It's customized, just like you ordered. See? Hand carving at its finest. Good. Thank you. I'm leaving then. Is this girl also going to become ashes? Yes. She's just like your grandma. She'll become a star too. Xiaowen, where have you been again? Xiaowen, I made you lotus roots with pork ribs. It's ready to eat. YOU UNSENT A MESSAGE Come home soon. Be careful on the way. Remember to drink a lot of water when playing outside. Stand in the shade while you play. A girl won't look pretty with tanned skin. Baby, I got you a watermelon. Come back and eat it. Xiaowen, it's your birthday today. Don't spend too long playing outside. Come home soon. I only asked you to get some garlic. What took you so long? What are you doing? Why on earth would I have ever given you credit? What happened? What's going on? What happened? What did I tell you about her? This little devil is my archnemesis. You won't quit until you have me crushed beneath the Five Finger Mountain, right? Are you drawing on a cinerary casket? What on earth were you thinking? Say it! Hello. The urn I ordered yesterday... How long will it take to get another one? Tomorrow morning? That's no good. The cremation is at 9 a.m. today. I came to see you. I'm here. I'm here. I failed. I failed to look after you. I failed. I'm so sorry. I can't get rid of the drawing. Dish wash, disinfectant, gasoline, and alcohol. We've tried everything. Maybe we can talk them into changing it? Changing what? They wanted a customized cinerary casket, not an ashtray. Then what are we supposed to do? Open your eyes wide and look carefully. Watch how I'm getting ruined because of you. Sir, we both have daughters. Looking at your wife sobbing this hard, it... It breaks my heart as well. My daughter... She wanted to express her grief for a fellow child, so... Just take a look yourselves. We can see that you put a lot of effort into this. Our daughter... She loved drawing. Where is your girl? My daughter is over there. We've been concentrating on our careers and it wasn't until after our child fell sick did we realize what the most important thing is. Be with her. Take this. No. This won't do. Sir, this won't do. - It's for the child. - This money... UP SKY Eat. It's all yours. You even said she's a jinx and nemesis? I think she's a lucky star. She's not so annoying when she's not looking for her grandma. Don't eat stuff that has fallen on the floor. There's still a lot left in the bowl. What is this? It's not for eating! - Spit it out! - Spit it out! Spit it out! - Spit it out. - Open your mouth. Now. Where is it? Did you swallow it? My grandma said every grain is the fruit of hard work. Someone actually took this for food and ate it? You are such irresponsible parents. Can we take it out? Take some medicine first, eat Chinese chives or bananas, monitor her bowel movements in the next two days, and see if it comes out with the feces. Have you found it yet? No. It's your turn now. She pooped it out. Well done, Xiaowen. You pooped it out. You pooped it out. Hello? You're back. No need. I'll bring her back. They're back. Pack up. Okay. The whole family went to Beijing for you. The trip cost me several months' wages. And look at you. You got the last place in the competition. How dare you? This child is getting ruined because of you. I think you've been paying too much attention on other people's kids. We're sorry for troubling you. Sir, about this receipt from the hospital, you can transfer the money to me - via the phone. - Your mom didn't leave me a single cent, Why should I raise her up？ If you want to keep her, I suggest you bring her back to Sichuan and raise her there. You want me to look after both of you and her. What have I done to deserve this? Are you kidding me? It's bad enough you don't earn much. It's exhausting for me. Why are you back? Can you be nice to the child? If you want to be nice to her, keep her. Go before you mess up our floor. What are you saying? - I don't care who you are. - What did you say? You're such a jerk. - Say that again. - I'll call the cops. - What did you say? - Get out of the way. - I'll give you a good, hard slap. - You're bad. I want to call the cops. - Wait. - Scram. What an uncivilized creature. You've already come this far, how about you look after Xiaowen for a few more days? You've seen what it's like here. I still need to work on my wife about this. Sir. You really are treating us like an orphanage. We sell graveclothes. I'll pay. Xiaowen, are you willing to stay here or would you go with them? What on earth got into your head this time? Don't you think our last few days have been exhilarating enough? So we're keeping her here again, fine. But why did you refuse to take the money? You said it yourself, "She's my archenemy. My nemesis." Are you the Monkey King? Changing your form daily? You're right, I am the Monkey King and I don't like seeing those devils bully her. What are you doing here? What's going on? What's wrong with you? Your brother-in-law said you were with a child and made a whole mess at the parlor. That stammerer is also a snitch. - You've learned to swear? - Dad... I'm going to teach you a good lesson - in front of the crowd here. - Do it then. Hit me. - Hit me here. Do it. - I... You can't hit San. This is the child. Hurry and send her back. The crematorium is no place for a kid. When I was her age, you'd already taught me how to dress up the dead. Nonsense. Don't forget your trial period isn't over. If you still want the house... Fine. He has been threatening me with this stupid house for over a year. He never wanted to give it to me. You shut up. How about this? I will buy this house from you. You can't afford it. Give me a quote. Three hundred thousand yuan? Five hundred thousand yuan? - A million? - Sanmei, are you crazy? Three hundred thousand yuan in 30 days or get out of my house. Sir. Sir. There's a child to look after and a house to buy. I'm definitely going to have insomnia tonight. WE ARE GETTING MARRIED Tell me your cell phone number. Stop bothering me. Just tell me. 6037884. You're crushed beneath the Five Finger Mountain for real. I wouldn't have been crushed beneath the mountain if you hadn't done what you did at the funeral parlor. If I'm stuck underneath the mountain, you won't get any closer to finding your grandma. Do you have a hole in your jaw where food leaks out? It has fallen out. Don't eat it. It's less than three seconds, so it's still safe to eat. My grandma told me that. I'm going to have to lay some ground rules here. First, chew and swallow slowly when eating. Second, food on the ground is dirty, so don't eat it. Not exactly clean but won't exactly get sick. My grandma told me that. Third, stop mentioning your grandma. Forget about her from today. Fourth, no biting people. So jumpy. Where are you going? I'm having a shit! Fifth, stop talking like that! - Goodbye. - Take care. Three hundred thousand yuan in one month. Why don't we just give up like what you suggested? I got us into this. I'll handle it myself. Your handling caused this. Why did you have to fight your dad like that? He didn't like seeing you with Xiaowen, so just send her back home for a while, wait until he calms down a bit, and that will be it. Kowtow, apologize, and the case is closed. If he won't allow me to have her, the more I'll do it. I'll look after her so that he can watch me do it. Xiaowen. Xiaowen. XIAONEZHA Hello? San, come to the park. This is Mr. Liu. He used to dance with my grandma. This is San. He's the one that turned my grandma into a star. I'll let you two talk. I want to hold a funeral. For whom? For myself. Sir. A little girl can be excused for being a child. With your age, you shouldn't talk nonsense. What is your problem? Let's go. Talk with him a little more, San. Don't grab me like that. I don't really have much to live for, so I just want to see my funeral with my own eyes, I'll pay if that's what you're worried about. How much can you pay? How much can a funeral cost? Well, that depends on the type of funeral you want. In ancient times, when a poor person dies, you just pack him up in a bamboo sleeping mat. But when an emperor dies, the entire nation mourns with their tears and it might even cost half the gold in the treasury. Then I think I'll have the emperor's funeral. Are you crazy? I will pay you 300,000. If you guys can do it, I'll put the deposit down right away. Of course we can. Deal. Deal. Cheers. Cheers. It's a success. So it has come full circle. Our Xiaowen may have done something wrong and got us into trouble in the first place, but in the blink of an eye, she has made up for it. I think we should probably think more carefully about this. Why would anyone want to spend so much money to hold such a ridiculous funeral for oneself? There are all kinds of birds in a big forest. Costume. Setting. Baixue, look for it at your theater company. Jianren, I'll leave you to find the extras. Don't miss this! Placements for a period production. It's paid work. Our general principle is to save every penny we can. - Come on. - Let's drink. It's 100 yuan for a day's work, sir. It's 100 yuan. Paid work. Have a look. Xiaowen, I understand you the best. I didn't have a happy childhood. Cheers. Empty the cup. URGENT HIRING FOR A PERIOD PRODUCTION How much for a day's work? Tears pour down from the Heavens. Mother Earth wails in lamentation. The mountains are rocking. The rivers are shaking. Dimmed are the sun and the moon. And the Emperor is no more with us. Play the music! Can't they cry louder? Louder. Cry like you're heartbroken and look sad. No tears, no pay. Louder! You cry as well. Your majesty! Your majesty! Dad? I can't believe my eyes. You bring shame upon our family name. Which one of you is Mo Sanmei? Which one? It's him. - See? - Run! Go get them! They are here! Get our money back! - Go! - Let me go! Let me go! HUAI'AN ROAD POLICE STATION What are you doing? My grandma taught me this. It relieves the pain and prevents inflammation. All right. Put your signatures down. You can go now. A moment, please, San. Do you think that I was being ridiculous? And that I was out of my mind? Two years ago, our old house got demolished for redevelopment and we received a compensation package. Since then, the family hasn't seen a single day of peace. Do you mean that's why you came up with the idea to spend all the money? When Xiaowen came to me that day, she wanted me to withdraw her late grandma's money from the bank. She said that you were in trouble and she wanted to help you move the Five Finger Mountain. Xiaowen told me that from now on, she's going to live with you. I really wanted to help you. Her grandma had a hard life and didn't have a lot of savings. Young man, please be good to Xiaowen. I thank you on her grandma's behalf. Don't break things. Dad. Dad, please stop breaking things. I'm going to destroy this place once and for all today. I'd rather burn the place down than see you disgrace it any further. A funeral for the living? No one in our industry has ever done such a thing. Well, there has to be a first in everything, right? So I'm the first. Now there's an example to follow. Old man. I accepted the job, not San. If you must hit someone, then hit me. Look at you. Look at you. Pack your things and move out before the month's end. Sir, please calm down. We'll definitely change. How am I supposed to change? How do I change? Into what? No matter what I do, it's always wrong in his eyes. When I was a kid, I wanted to watch cartoons. I didn't want to follow him to the parlor. He beat me up for it. When others mocked me about how I make money off the dead and I had a fight with them, what did he do? He watched from upstairs, then he turned around and went inside without doing anything. Sanmei! Dad, I just want to ask you one thing. I know you prefer my older brother. He's your favorite son. How about this? You beat me to death and I'll swap places with him. He'll come back and be with you. Sanmei! BUSINESS LICENSE What are you crying about? Did I get you in trouble again? Look. I fixed your red-tasseled spear. It's not your fault. It's my fault. I don't have what it takes to make it. It's all right. Stop crying. Sleep now. After you fall asleep, the star in the sky will come down and appear in your dreams as your grandma and chat with you. Really? Try it. My watch is broken. Can you fix it for me? No problem. Can I borrow your pen? Give me your hand. All right. Wear this watch for a few days as a replacement. Sleep now. We don't play with the uncultured, son. Come, let's recite a Tang poem. "On the Stork Tower" by Wang Zhihuan, Tang Dynasty. The sun beyond the mountain glows The Yellow River seaward flows Louder. You can enjoy a grander sight By climbing to a greater height Come, Xiaowen. It's time to eat. It's time for her to go to school. I should be paying the fees. You see. This is my sister's and this is my mom's. Xiaowen is such a poor child. It's all because of my sister's bad relationships. We still don't know who the dad is. My sister is dead and so is my mom, I should be the one raising her. But look at me, no one listens to me in my own house. Enough. A grown man shouldn't cry like a baby. Just tell me what you want. Why don't you just adopt her? According to Article 9 of the Adoption Law, in the case of single males attempting to adopt females, there should be an age gap between the two parties of at least 40 years. What does that mean? He's unmarried, therefore ineligible for adoption. San, why are you here? I've brought some late-night snacks. Here. I want to adopt Xiaowen. That's great. But the Civil Affairs Bureau says that since I'm unmarried, I can't adopt her. I can smell perfume on you. Is it obvious? - So perhaps we should... - You can wash up now. When did you get here? Well, since you've seen us together now, there's no need to hide anymore. We got the marriage certificate. From now on, we're family, Xiaowen. Right, hold it up. Take a picture. Come on. One, two, three. Here, sign it. - I'm not going in! - Be a good kid, Xiaowen. - Listen, kindergarten is fun. - I'm not going! - School is no fun! - Let go. - You let go first. - You let go! - You first! - Fine, I'm letting you go. Well, I guess it can't be helped. I never went to kindergarten. - Bye. - Isn't that so? Fine, if we're not going, then we're not going. Come on. - Let's go home and play mahjong. - Let's go. I'm not going in! Let me go! I'm not going in! Look. It's pretty messed up in there. Normally, we couldn't fix it. You're better off with a new one. This property benefits greatly from excellent lighting conditions and soundproofing. Take a look at this bed and this desk, they are ready for use. Later, after your child finishes school day, bring her here. I guarantee she'll like it. JUNE 28TH, MONDAY I'll call you back. Don't worry. He's coming soon. The latest model. Try it on. Does it have my grandma's voice? Your grandma's voice was in the old watch. Can't the old watch be fixed? I will never hear my grandma's voice again, will I? That's nonsense. Tell me. Who am I? You're the Monkey King. That's right. I cast a spell and your grandma's voice will magically come back. Keep drawing. WORK NOTES SEVERE JOINT PAIN... What are you doing here? Laoliu is gone. He's gone? Go find him then. He crashed into a ten-wheeler truck. Both he and his car got mashed together. Since he was drunk and on the wrong side of the road, it was entirely his fault and responsibility. So I had to sell the store to pay compensation. I have no money now. His family wants to pay last respects, but I don't think they can because... Because his body was crushed so badly. It was horribly disfigured. Repairing his appearance at the parlor is too expensive. You're in this line of work. What line of work do you think I'm in? - Sanmei. - Get off me. Please help me. Stop calling me Sanmei. I hate people calling me by my full first name. And I'm very busy now. I don't have the time to argue with you. Just leave. Wait. I know who you are. Don't say that. You're the one on San's cell phone. Whenever he looks at your picture, he would cry. Don't say things like that. Why are you still here? With our relationship, I was in the wrong. I admit it. We hurt you. No, you didn't. I was over you a long while ago. Go. On behalf of Laoliu, I apologize. San. I'm sorry. Get up. It's not good for the baby. Then will you help? This job is not something I can do. My dad can, but we're not on speaking terms lately. I'll go. I'm not afraid of him. Old man. San wants to tell you something, but please don't scold him. Why should I listen to you then? You have to. Then call me grandpa and I'll listen to you. Grandpa. Louder. Grandpa! My granddaughter wants me for something. You guys carry on. Let's go then. No arguing. Lay it out. I don't drink your counterfeit alcohol. This is genuine. It cost me over 2,000 yuan. Don't let your sister know. So even you are afraid of someone. Tell me then. For what business do you seek my help? You do it. I can't, Dad. I can't do this. You can do this. I taught you when you were little. Go and get the tools. What's his name... Jianren, take that graph out. First, rebuild the skeleton. First, straighten out the tendons. Second, put the bones back where they belong. We go backward from toe to head. Limbs come first, then the torso. The internal organs - must be in order. - Must be in order. The face and the skull. - Twenty-three pieces in all. - Twenty-three pieces in all. -Brows, eyes, nose, and mouth -Brows, eyes, nose, and mouth - are firmly in the middle. - are firmly in the middle. Stitch up. It's done. That's my son. Dad! Sir! Dad! Sir! Why did you let him drink? Are you trying to get him killed? I've been keeping this to myself for a long time, but all these years, when you weren't happy with how things were going, you were blaming Dad for everything. You're so selfish. Dad. You're awake. You scared us to death there. I'm fine. Same old problem. Hello? Got it. What is it? Something came up at the kindergarten. Well, hurry up then. I'll live. Then I'll come back as soon as I can, okay? Finally, he truly cares about something. - Thank you, everyone. - Thank you, everyone. WELCOME TO PARTICIPATE IN PARENT-CHILD CLASS Excellent. Now, the next item is a performance by Xiaowen and Xiaopang. Let's give them a round of applause. He's my son. Kneel. The filial son breaks the bowl and Paradise in the West opens its gates. Mom! Have a safe journey to the next world. I... On your feet. So basically this is what happened. This child's problem is merely a reflection of a bigger issue. There must be a bigger focus on education from the parents. Our parent-child class is only once per month. Someone has to be here for her no matter how busy you are. This is a drawing she made in the art class yesterday. Take a look. Funeral wreaths and urns. The drawing looks so scary. So I asked her. What do your parents do for a living? She said, "My mom and dad plant stars." Plant... To be honest, I had a pretty good guess already. So be careful with your parenting methods, all right? Don't hit the child! Sorry. We apologize. It will be your brother's death day in a few days. Don't forget to burn some spiritual money for him. Dad. My older brother must have been much better than me, right? Every new year, after we have kowtowed to our ancestors, I would order you to kneel and do the same for your brother. That's why you've always hated him. You never really asked me about him. Dad. It's just a sniff. It was the summer of 1988. I took your brother to the Yangtze River to retrieve a body. It was a teenage boy that sank into the water. His mom was standing by the river weeping uncontrollably. We went down three times but couldn't find the boy's body. When I finally got out of the water, your brother was nowhere to be seen. He secretly went under water again by himself. Your brother managed to find the missing boy. The boy's body was retrieved, but your brother didn't come up. For someone already dead, our family lost a living soul. Life is like a book. Each one has to reach the last page somehow. In some books, there's a full stop at the very end. In others, there's only an ellipsis. In life, nothing is bigger than death itself. Fame, wealth, all smoke and mirrors. One who does our line of work for a living must have the heart of a saint. UP SKY UP SKY UP SKY We're not moving. Are you the Monkey King? Changing forms every day? Thank you. Thank you. Hello? Curly, it's me, San. So this is the situation here. There's data on my cell phone that can't be retrieved now, but I'd like to recover the data. STUDY NOTES Do you happen to know anyone that can fix cell phones and smartwatches? What? He changed jobs? The sun is setting. It's the old man's last day before cremation. Has everyone done their part? Has the filial son been keeping vigil? Why am I the only one chanting here? How about we all make some noise? Hey. It's me, San. So it can't be done? JUNE 12TH, 2021 Look at this scrawl. It's like a dung beetle did it by crawling. CUSTOMIZATION, EXCLUSIVE FUNERAL UP SKY SKY BOSHI TECHNOLOGY If these guys can't do it, then no one else can. Everyone, please. I'd really appreciate it. Well done. RETRIEVING THE DATA It's done. Three, four, five, six, seven. One, two, one... -Happy birthday to you -Happy birthday to you -Happy birthday to you -Happy birthday to you -Happy birthday to you -Happy birthday to you -Happy birthday to you -Happy birthday to you Hey, look. Does Beans seem a bit different? It has ears and eyes now. The tail is different too. Give it a squeeze. I made you lotus roots with pork ribs. It's ready to eat, Xiaowen. Where have you gone? Come home soon. Be careful on the way. Remember to drink a lot of water when playing outside. Stand in the shade while you play. A girl won't look pretty with tanned skin. Baby, I got you a watermelon. Come back and eat it. Our Xiaowen is the prettiest. Our Xiaowen is the best. Let's come home together. We'll get your favorite gluttonous rice cake in brown sugar. Xiaowen, it's your birthday today. Don't spend too long playing outside. I bought you a new dress. Come back and try it on. See if it fits. Xiaowen, lock the door from the inside and don't open it no matter what. My big baby, please be patient. I'll be home soon. Grandma is great at making braids. I'll make the prettiest braid for you tomorrow. My granddaughter is the prettiest of them all. - Take another bite. - Good morning. Xiaowen, wait. - One moment. - Your water bottle. - Good morning. - Good morning. Don't forget to drink water. How come you're here? This is my little sister, Haifei. She is Xiaowen's biological mom. Over here. Didn't you tell me that her mom is dead? So the death certificate you showed me was fake? I... The certificate is real. This is a very complicated situation. It's like this... Tell him yourself. I'm done. He's not lying, San. Where did you come from? Why should I just believe everything you said and do whatever you asked me to? Xiaowen was born at 9 a.m. on July 6th, 2015. The whole birthing process took 27 hours. She wouldn't come out no matter what, so I had to have a C-section in the end. There's a diamond-shaped birthmark on her left foot. If you still don't believe me, we can do a DNA test. I'm not letting you do any silly tests. Xiaowen. Have you ever met your mom? I have no mom or dad. I jumped out of a crack in a stone. Sir. I've been waiting out here all these days. It seems none of us can sleep... Where the hell have you been? Where were you when her grandma died? Where were you when she was causing trouble all over the place? Where were you when her aunt kicked her out of the house? Finally, she has a place she could call home and you're trying to take her away? Who gave you the right? You're right. I deserve so much blame. Are you out of your mind? I left home when I was a teenager. I followed some classmates and stepped straight into society. I didn't achieve anything and gave birth to a child. My boyfriend ran away when he saw I was pregnant. I refused to give up my dreams, so I went abroad. I did something bad and ended up in prison. My mom couldn't contact me, so I was presumed dead. But even in prison, I thought about Xiaowen every day. I know I'm a bad mom. I've been a terrible mom, but... But she's still my child. I... And I'm still her mom. She came out of me. This is not a decision I can make it by myself. There's also my buddy, Jianren, and Baixue. I can't make their decisions for them. Sir. Please. I beg you. Give her back to me. Please, I'm begging you. How about you give me three more days? HEARSE FOR RENT Look at you, San. Now that's a rare sight to behold. I learned it from the Internet. Try it. I hope it's not too bad. Why do you look unhappy? What? No. I don't look unhappy. Do you have a hole in your jaw where food leaks out? Your grandma was right. Every grain is the fruit of hard work. My teacher says there's another parent-child class tomorrow. A parent needs to be present. Which one of you wants to go? - I do. - I do. Only one though. I'll go. HUAJIAJIA KINDERGARTEN - Go! - Go! - Go! - Go! - Mom, Dad, thank you for everything. - Dad, thank you for everything. I know that you've been lying to me. I'll never see my grandma again. But I'm not afraid anymore because I have a dad now. What is your dad's name? Mo Sanmei. Where does he live? Up Sky, No. 73, Huai'an Road, Yuhua District, Yanjiang City. What is your dad's cell phone number? What are you doing so late at night? I'm so sleepy. You won't forget about me in the future? I'll find a small mirror for you. UP SKY These are things that she'd use regularly. -Her clothes, her favorite snacks, -Okay. and her school backpack. She doesn't like drinking water, so you have to make sure she drinks plenty. This cloth tiger is called Beans. Her grandma sewed it for her. It's her favorite thing in the world. She likes grabbing the arm of an adult when she sleeps. She likes putting her mouth here. She eats too fast. Also, you have to remind her that food on the ground shouldn't be eaten. I'm warning you. You have to be good to her. I've been to prison, so I don't mind going back again. Here's some money. It's not much, but you should take it. - I can't take this. - Take it. - I can't take this. - Take it! It's not for you. - It's for Xiaowen. - San? Where is this? Who are you? Child, I am your mom. - I'm taking you home. - I don't have a mom. - How can that be? - Xiaowen. Xiaowen, listen to me. She really is your mom and she has come to take you home. - I'm not going with her. Let me go! - Xiaowen. Let go! - I'm not going with her! - Be good. - Be good. - I have no mom. I'm not going with her! Please let us go. Just let us go. I'm not going with her! Let me go! - Go. Drive! - I'm not going with her! Let me go! San! Back here. San! - I'm not going with her! - Be good. - Be good and come home with me. - San! San! Stop shouting, Xiaowen. - San! - Xiaowen. - San! - Back here. Stop hitting and screaming. Dad! Dad! UP SKY You're always so full of yourself. Did you ask Xiaowen what she wanted? Did you ask us what we wanted? Technically, we're her parents! She's registered under my household. You're so selfish. You're so selfish. You're so selfish. You want to give up the business? Fine! Let's do it now! Pack our things. You are a heartless beast. No wonder your dad looks down on you! No wonder your girlfriend cheated on you! You don't deserve to be called human! Bastard. Sanmei, Dad is gone. My children, sooner or later, this day would come, so I've prepared a letter for you two. You shouldn't feel sad about my passing. Everyone has to face this inevitability. San, I'll leave the funeral arrangements to you. Don't give me that big ceremony crap. I've seen enough of that in my lifetime. I want to leave this world clean and pure. Just like how I came into this world. Keep the spending low and remember this. I'm watching you. I'd like a customized funeral that's both dignified and inexpensive. Instead of splashing on a ceremonial casket, I'd rather you spend the money on a family feast. After the cremation, put me in that can. And the dispatching of my remains, I'll leave that to you. Think of this as a test from your dad. If you can't think of an answer, I'll just stay in the can and going nowhere. My sister, how should we do this? How should we do what? How do we dispatch Dad's remains? Buried together with mom's, of course. No, Dad was very clear in his will. He said he wants a special funeral that's different. Well, how special can a funeral be? Where else can we put it if not underground? In the sky? Sanmei! Stop! Stop him! - Go after him. - Leave now! Quick. - In the car. Quick. - Okay. QINGTIAN FUNERAL PARLOR Faster. San, I can't believe you left me out of something this big. - Do you not think of me as your friend? - Well, here I am, aren't I? - Quick. - Go. UP SKY Sanmei, stop. Stop now! San. - Hurry up. - Quick. Hold my sister up! Sanmei. Stop! - Ma'am. - Stop right there. - Don't come closer. - Stop. Take this. - Sanmei. - Don't go. - All right. - Quick. Stay back. Here, it's dangerous over there. Dad, how is this for dignified? Xiaowen is missing. I have a dream. I want to be an... Is she with you? Xiaowen! CUSTOMIZATION, EXCLUSIVE FUNERAL UP SKY San! Where have you been? Tell me. Where were you? Why are you running around in the middle of the night? What if you're kidnapped by bad guys? What if you got lost? My dad's name is Mo Sanmei. My home is Up Sky, No. 73, Huai'an Road, Yuhua District, Yanjiang City. I won't get lost. I promise you. I will never leave you behind again. Play the music! Dear friends and neighbors, brothers and sisters, let's give a round of applause and also some cheers and screams. Into the chamber of joy they go, together until their hair have turned silver, even unto the next life they shall be united.
