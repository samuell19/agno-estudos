AUGUST 1944 GRAHOVO, YUGOSLAVIA - What's happening? - Go. Mom! Who are they? I don't have time to explain it to you now. You have to go. Quick! Mom will come after you. - Mama - Go. You have to go. Anybody here? Would you mind? For sure. - Is everything ready? - Yes. - Did you have any problems? - No. RENEGADES SARAJEVO, 1995 Hello. Your documents. Out! Out! Out! Hands above your head! Move! Your hand! - Hey, take it easy! - Clothes off. - Like a start. - We've had worse. Now! Yeah I, I probably should have worn a different underwear huh? Get dressed. Future access to the general will depend on your handling of this interview. We expect his words to be heard unedited. The world must see this a man of humanity and integrity. We are here to report what he has to say. Word for word. - Shit! - What's the odd, JP? These things always get wet. Let's go old school. Go on, we gotta move. All right, general, could I just get your sound level please? Just speak normally. I might have you all skinned alive once all of this is done. Sounds good to me. - Hear what he just said? - Loud and clear, it is gonna be fun. Clear right. Clear left. Right here. General Milic, how do you respond to the international community, who say that your troops have committed these untold atrocities? Simply. Very simply. The people of the world had been fed lies.. They fail to understand the consequences of Croatia's separation... I am sorry, uh... General. We lost sound. If I may, I just need to Uh.. Change up the battery. Sorry. Won't take too long. Okay, great, okay. How's that? Good to go. Stand by. Three, two, one, execute! Corning steel! - How was interview, boys? - Pretty boring. Yeah the sound was great! Let's go. Shit! Down, down. Alright, we got a Serb boat out there. Three, two, one, go! All right, get the general. Get the bags. Stanton, clear those stairs for us. Stairs clear. Contact left! Stanton, get up here! RPG! Stanton! Last man! You sure? Always. - Where did you learn to drive a tank? - Ah, it's first time, how am I doing? 2-2 SAS, this is Formula 150. Copy? 2-2 SAS, do you read? - Yes, Formula 150, we read. - Finally! So, we have got the package. We're moving due east. Modify Exfil plan. What do you think, Formula 150? We will have to check with command. Over. - JP, did you ever shot one of those? - You got a trigger, I can shoot it. Use the trigger. Here we go! Round one, ready a sec! RPG! Shoot! Shoot! Shit, diesel reserves. The aim's too high. - Hit him, JP! - Got it. I got it. Fuel for the fire. I think you hit 'em. 2-2 SAS! What's the new extraction point? Hold on, 150. Still waiting on command for authorization. Alright, we got company. Authorize yourself to land that chopper, we need it. Now! Grenade! Negative, 150. You are now in unsupported airspace. - Stick to the plan. - What? I ain't got time for this shit! - So where are we going? - We're taking the scenic route. Incoming! - JP, you see the comms tower? - Yeah. Bring it down! Go! Go! Go! Got him, got him! Yes! Yes! All clear. Boys, I got a tank in front of us. I got one behind this too. Petrovic. - JP? - Chief? Turn the gun at ten o'clock. - Hit it. - Copy that. We're going for a swim, boys. - There you go. - Shoot them! So, when do you wanna go? When it stops raining. Alert the patrol boat. I want you to stop them. Formula 150, we have clearance for the alternative extraction. - Formula 150, we have clearance... - Chief? I repeat, we now have clearance for alternative extraction, over. Are you kidding me? You're little late, boys. FORWARD OPERATING BASE, BOSNIA-HERZEGOVINA Do you have any idea the shit storm you've created. The people I have had to explain this to. - I believe I do, Sir. - Who asked you? And no, you do not, Barnes! Because you don't have two ounces of gray matter bouncing around inside that hollow metal on top of your shoulder. Okay, sir. Your orders, were to get in, secure the package, deliver it without a footprint, like we were never there! And what we get? A soviet era tank running roughshod over half the goddamn city of Sarajevo, Dead Serbs in its wake. And a highly uncomfortable conversation between myself... and the Under Secretary of the Joint Chief of staff. Sir, we were compromised. So, in order to protect my team and complete the op, we had to adapt. And you thought driving a goddamn tank over half of Sarajevo was the answer? Yes, sir, I did. You're all on leave. Three days. During which time command will decide whether to flay your asses in public, for all the world to see, or maybe just do it here, privately, so only we get to enjoy it. Dismissed. Wait. Almost forgot. There's four more. FYI, I will be having quite the turse conversation with 22 SAS. Enjoy that with utmost discretion. Dismissed. Goddamn tank! Anyone for another drink? Cause I... Buy it. Well, this round's on me. Cause I wanna say something. You are not gonna hear a word I'm saying. Cause I can't hear myself. Boys! Shut up! Now you shut up? JP, privacy. After that trick, I got to say... Boys, here is to the success of that mission. And here's to the success of many more. I couldn't ask for more from any of you boys. To The team! Gentlemen, start your livers. Already done. Oh, oh, Nine o' clock, nine o' clock. Gorgeous! Ah... Lara! Lara, Lara, Lara! I got a question for you, Lara. Of all the guys sitting here, and I am including myself in these... degenerates. Which one of us seems most likely to succeed... with you? How do you say "not you"? - Shot down. - Ice cold! And how do I say "she's perfect"? There you go, guys. This one is on me. Hey Peter, listen, your waitress, Lara. What's the deal with her? She's beautiful, no? Yes, she is beautiful, but she's unreceptive to my charms. Well, she's real deal. A local girl with morals. Oh, morals. Well, that will put her way out of your league. And now I wanna know, why you are laughing. Cause you're not even trying. Ben, that's because I don't try. You should try it. Which way are we going? Getting a kebab? - No, I'm full. - Really? Yeah, I might take a walk. Keep your eye out for Petrovich's guys. He is sore a loser. See you bud. My most likely to succeed. Is my man hungry? No, your man is happy right where he is. I've been thinking... I want you to come home with me when we are done here. Why do you want me to bring me to your home? Because I love you. And because... You've changed me. My future is here. - I can not leave my country. - Now, Lara, it's a mess out there. Would you run away these terrible things were happening in Bakers town? Bakersfield. No. No, I wouldn't. Some weeks ago I started a foundation. And yesterday, I got official papers. Now I can raise money for what my country needs. It's an opportunity. - You want to know the name? - Sure. It's the Lara Civic Foundation for rebuilt and better Bosnia Herzegovina. That's a long title. - I deserved that. - Hmm, you do. You really are soft. Yes, I am. Cowboy. - What is this? - Smells good. Get out now. Yes, we will be leaving. As soon as you give us the bar. Give it up, Lara. I will not ask for it again. You went too far Milenko. Bringing these animals into my house. - Give it to us or we'll find it! - Go to hell! Get out! Out! Hey... What's going on here? Don't mess with us, American. We don't fight nice here. That's okay. Neither do I. Friends? Look at this fool... Now she gives us what we came for, or your brain makes a pretty picture right here on the floor. - Don't say anything, Lara. - It's not here. I'll show you where it is. Just don't hurt him. He knows nothing about it. That's my girl. Told you you should have gone get a kebab. They are really good. This one is mine. - How long have you known? - What? About you two? All time. You have not been very subtle. So, Lara... Who are these guys? Well, this one is my brother. The other ones I don't know. Well... You... Might wanna start using this head. Trying to work out what that's all about. Huh? .999 percent pure. 12.4 Kilograms. Worth about 150,000 in your American dollars. Jesus! - Where did you get this? - It's a long story. From... A long time ago. It is my grandfather's story. One that hunted him most of his life. Anybody here? He did everything he could to fight trouble. And when he couldn't find it, trouble found him. Drop it, please. Get that rascal, he's got my gold! Fire! Calm down, calm down! I will help you. No! I'm not a Nazi! Just calm down... Come on. Come, come. I'm your friend. Will you trust me? Would you come with me? Come on. Let's go. You first. - Everything is ready? - All ready. - Did you have any problems? - No. Here. Come. Hit it. It was as if GRAHOVO never existed. In time it was forgotten. But my grandfather... he never forgot. CASA ROBLES, Vault & Safe, Lorca SPAIN, CR 100007 People of my town laughed at him. They said that he was just a crazy old man telling made up stories. But to me there was always something different about this story. There was pain in it. A sadness he held inside him the rest of his life. And the gold bar? It was exactly where he told me it would be. At the base of that statue. Can you imagine what that gold could do to help my people? Will you help me get it? You are saying that this is Nazi gold? French gold, stolen by the Nazis. And there's more these at the bottom of this lake? And nobody knows it's there? - How many of these are down there? - Trucks full. Two thousand bars, maybe more. - How much, Ben? - This is about 150,000 dollars. Times 2 thousand bars, 300 million dollars. - You realize what we're talking about here? - Recovering more than 300 million dollars in gold bars that nobody seen in 50 years. Yeah. Under 150 feet of water. Right in the middle of enemy territory. Not to mention the logistics for an operation like that. How did you even find out about this? - Hello Love. - Honey. You remember Lara, right? - The other night. - From the bar. I remember what happened. Who wants wine? These villages here... Wiped out. Gone. Those who managed to escape live worse than animals. Scraps of food, contaminated water, no medical help... My lady, that's why NATO is here. - Put an end to all that. - What happens when we all leave? They will have to rebuild their lives again. That gold... It can build schools, hospitals, roads. It will change the lives of people who have no future. Let's say we're able to get the gold. How do I know you're not gonna take your share, pack your things and to Switzerland? You're asking me to put my men at risk. And potentially get them killed for what? What guarantee do we have that you'll do what you say? You're correct. If you do this, I can not tell you the future. But I can tell you that I do not lie. My heart is with my country. In this gold I see hope. And hope is the only thing we have left. Alright. Three hundred million. - Splits 6 ways. - Two ways. - Excuse me? - Split two ways. One half to you, the other half to my people. 50/50. You take it or leave it. We'll be risking everything. - Our careers... - How about our lives? You know, I like my life. Right Stakes, when you ask navy Seal, it's wrong to even be talking about it. We are talking about a major operation. In a hot zone in which we have no authority. It's just, it's crazy. It's too goddamn crazy to even be considering it. - What if we could? - You want to try? Be my guest. Stanton's right. What if we could? We've been here six months. What have we done? Now this isn't a military operation, it's a covert mop up drill. This is a chance to do something extraordinary. To help these people. It's once in a lifetime opportunity, boys. It's once in a million. So what do you say boys? Let me ask you something. You and me, all this time... Was it only to get the gold? I did choose you because I know you can help me. But then... I fall for you. You can believe me. I love you. We are in. All of us. Keep looking. According to Lara's grandfather, the Germans were loading the gold into the bank before the dam blew. Inside the bank is a vault made in Lorca, Spain, crafted in the 30s. That's the serial number. Find out the kind of the steel, thickness, lock mechanism, anything that's gonna help us bust that thing open. That's the base's supply inventory. Identify the gear we'll need. - Figure how to borrow it. - Done. There is a long wooden dock about 300 yards from our dive point. We'll launch from there. We'll dive in three teams of two. Right. We're gonna need magnesium, burning bars and pure O2 to cut though this steel. And also a generator. - And ten air tanks each night. - You got 'em. - How many nights you're talking? - Oh, I figure five. We take turns dive in 10 minute intervals to avoid decompression sickness. Supply cloaks are tight asses when it comes to air tanks. But you know what's funny, SAS just happen to have whole bunch of that lying around. Assholes messed up the extract in our last op. They should be more than happy to help us out. If they don't, we help ourselves. Anybody except me wanna know how we're gonna get 2,000 gold bars up out of that lake? What do we need? Batteries, thermal lenses, burn bars... - Ask him for burning bars. - Electrode. They are here to help us, Mr. Kurjak. I'll take that as a yes. Yeah, awesome. Alright, so, we need twenty of them. Twenty pieces. What's so funny? He asked if you Americans plan to rob a bank. So, the vault was sophisticated for a height. 4 inches of tempered steel over half a meter of concrete. JP, that'll take us days to burn through. But to save money, vault manufactures made the side walls that lie next to interior walls half that thickness. And the vault is against the wall of the church next door. Alright. So we're going that way. I swear to God, if we... We get this gold out, I'm going to put this on humanitarian use. - What? So are you on brewery? - Duffy's ale House, yeah. - I see a Nobel Prize. - Thank you. - Cheers to that. - I am not to piss on your parade... but if we can't find a way to get several tons of gold out of that lake, - You ain't brewing shit. - Good point. What the hell you doing in here, Duffy?! - I just wanted to stop by for a chat, Walt. - No, no, no. - You don't chat. - Well, the shopping then. - Dimitri? - My name is Sergei. Ah... Sergei, good! You're familiar with the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's operation, Joint endeavor? - I know nothing... - Well I do. More important than your knowledge is your willingness to assist the joint task force - in this urgent, secret mission. - Top secret. Top secret? How can I help? Oh, we need a company vehicle just for a few days. I would need to ask permission... Sergei, which part of top secret did you fail understand? I mean lives are at stake. You would be doing people of your country a huge service. I wouldn't be surprise if you are held as a hero. Maybe even a medal. Thank you, Sergei. And from this point forth, you have to deny everything. If anyone asks where that vehicle is, Then you don't know because...? Because...? - I don't know. - Exactly, exactly. Thank you sir. All right, Bob. Nice and steady, huh? OK, you can come, you can come. - Triple 70 equipment supply company? - Yeah that's it. Altoona, Pennsylvania, delighting the customers since 1971. That's one. - Alright! Don't stay out too late, ladies. - No we won't. Thank you. Alright! I'll grab what's left That's a good little base, bud. Got any family, Mr. Matt? Back home? - No, I don't. - You look like a family man. I'm not. And now is not the time for little talk or therapy sessions. Stay quite, don't make a sound, okay? Stay down. Let's go, guys! You are okay? C'mon. - It's alright, you okay? - Yeah. Thanks, Matt. - What's that? - You know very well, old man. Do you know that this can buy your shitty dump a hundred times? So what? What am I going to do with that? I need cash! Like this... So, thing about gold is it's heavy. Each gold bar, weighs about 27 pounds. If there is really 2000 bars then they're gonna weigh 27 tonnes. Alright, that means we're gonna have to make multiple runs to get her all up out of there. - So how long's that gonna take? - No, I can get it out in one shot. - Hey, how did it go yesterday? - Not good. Patrol boats, every 35 minutes on that lake. Petrovic hit on a convoy this morning, it's a hot zone out there. Boys, if we get compromised, we do not engage, withdraw, operation over. Alright, so what do you guys got? Einstein here was about to tell us how we're gonna get all the gold out of lake at one shot. - Really? - Yep. So, we need something that can displace water, but still bear the weight of the gold when it's at the surface. An cargo net, spread out on the floor of the lake. So what we'll do is, we'll have the gold right on top, then we take four small lifting bags on each corner, raise them till we gather to a point where we can add a very large lifting bag, but it's not enough. We'll have to do, straight over the top, a cargo parachute, the more volume. Add a little bit of air and... - Straight up to the surface. - Strong enough? Yeah, it's a Kevlar weave, yeah, plenty of strong. It's brilliant. - Almost. Still a problem. - I knew he wasn't that smart. That's how we get to the surface, but how did we get on land? Oh... You know I got that. - Whoa. - Tickle his balls. He calls it tickling his balls, isn't that right, D? Ever consider the nuisances down there? Like a surface-to-air missiles? RPG? No, shit like that just bums him out. See that wooden dock 200 meters out? That's where our drop position. What's down there that requires you're off the books mission? Gold. Nazi gold. As much as one million for you two to split. Well, that's the magic number. Next to flying, Detroit here simply loves money, ain't that right, D? - What's the object? - Well, you drop us here. Then you pick us and the gold drop at the agreed upon time. We split it up and go on merry ways. Sounds like good plan. The cargo's gonna be heavy. Gonna be a problem? Not if you're sending a super sea stallion. Well, you can fly one of those? The man can fly everything. Stallions, Dragons, Apache... You fit a tail rotor on Pamela Anderson, - he's gonna fly her too. - Is that right? - 3 days notice is all we need. - Good. Boys, we are in enemy territory. Shit could get real hot out here. Where did he go? Alright! How about you take me home? That's what they gave me. - Have you ever seen them before? - Them? Never. Just some punks... Those are their plates. What you did is very patriotic.. A very unusual and valuable item. Where's it from? I found it. From now on, I'll only speak to you... Now you'll tell me everything. What about decompression? That depth is gonna be an issue. - We might control the sense. - There you are. Levin wants you and your team in his office, on the double. Do you ladies have any idea why you're standing here before me? - I have an idea, sir. - You do not have a clue, Barnes. - That's what I meant to say, sir. - Yours truly... and General Tobias himself met with SAS command yesterday. We conducted an evaluation of your recent operation, which I supervised with my customary intelligence and thoroughness. This investigation led to the determination of what many had come to suspect about 2-2 SAS team. Do you know what that would be, Lieutenant? That we are a bunch of crumpled munching pussies sir? Correcte mundo. Furthermore, during the course of said review, the resourceful tactics and heroic actions of this team came to light. General Tobias was particularly impressed. Please do not start waving your tiny little penises around. Which reminds me, my arrogant little prick of a brother-in-law sent me a box of this 50 dollar cigars to commemorate the occasion of my birth. Now, personally, I'd assume grind one out in his eye, since he only does this to flaunt his wealth, thereby fueling his erroneous assertion of his own superiority. Classic Napoleon complex. But I digress. It seems... That a significant number of Serb head hunters are actively searching to kill you knuckleheads. Well sir, we welcome them to try. I am sure you would. Fortunately for them, that opportunity will not arrive. Joint command wants this whole mess to go away. And by this whole mess I do mean specifically the five of you. - Really, Sir? - You are being redeployed. As far away from here as humanely possible. In the meantime, you are shipping home. Transport plane to Mannheim departs in 36 hours. And your supremely lucky asses will be on it. Until then you are remanded to base. With all due respect, Sir, we don't believe that our work here has been fully accomplished. Appreciate that sentiment. Unfortunately, this is above my pay grade. Dismissed. Chief, so what do you wanna to? What do you mean, what do I wanna do? You heard the man. We're shipping out. We're done. Pack your things. Let's get drunk. I'm sorry, Stanton. I know you really wanted to do this for her. You love her, don't you? It's a stupid question. - You want me to tell her? - What? That I love her? No, you can tell her now, himself. See you two together... makes me happy, Stanton. You shouldn't have, Giacomo. Looks like we got a go on away party. - SAS, right? - That's right, mate. What can I do you for? There is absolutely nothing that you guys can do for us, but we dragged the fat fish and ship eating asses out - of a world war. - Two of them. Two. Two world wars. And you ladies can not run a simple extract op out of Bosnia. - You're drunk, mate. - No... Not drunk enough. How you doing, Porter? - Clear left. - Clear right. Pays to be a winner. My dad, he was a career naval officer. So is my grand dad. They both fought in a war. Who do we fighting in? A stupid peacekeeping mission. You lost. - What? - What you been doing? You been fighting? No! So you didn't run into any of the SAS? It's funny. Those things in your faces seem like you did. Yeah... - Cheers to that. - We'll make you proud chief. - Oh you do. - Cheers... To your next battle. Yes sir. What? You couldn't do it. You lost. - Rack him up again? - What? - I got something. - Oh yeah, a full glass. No, no, listen. Follow me, follow me. - What do you got? - So. Reason it's gonna take us a week to get into that vault is - we can only do an one hour dive, right? - Yeah. But if we build a operation base somewhere down there, an air pocket we can work out... We can work non stop and decompressing right at the end. Yeah, a airtight area we can pump air into. Smart man, get Stanton on the phone. Yeah, altar is on the main level. Above that's the choir gallery. The steeple made out of stone. - Is there a bell inside the steeple? - Solid bronze. Well then, we start by pumping air out of the bell. And then we'll load in the generator and we pump up the choir floor. That will be our operation's base. - How long do you think this op will take? - Eight hours tops. We could be back before sun rise. Get the gear down to the dock as fast as you can. The operation we talked about... We're going tonight. What! What did I tell you all? In three days notice. Can't requisition a helicopter just like that. Alright. What about pickup? Sun up. Can you do it? - Same coordinates? - 0-44-9 on the bun. You might wanna lay off that shit a few hours in advance. Hey, do you know where we can find another aircraft flying around? Pilot included? Hey Porter! Give me something good man. We need bird. There is a C-160 in the north hangar. It's just got back from the refueling run. - Subtle. - Yeah, that's my middle name. Alright, Ben, take it down. - Let's go! Orders just come in. - What orders? We didn't get any authorization for any... Emergency operation in under five minutes to go. - Thought SAS would seal transport - Yeah, they were. But command decided we needed real men flying us on this mission. That's you guys. So, load her up. Load her up, boys. Two minutes! Hey chief, I think this crazy idea might just work. Nice plan... Nice plan. - You okay? - Yeah, no problems. Good. Is that her? She won't get far. Stay with him. Two, three! Here you go. All right, boys. Time to drill through a stone wall. Say your prayers. We break the wall, break the vault... Gold deluxe. Mortar around the stone is starting to oxidize. - From the air we're pumping in. - How long it is gonna hold? Not long. This place has not seen oxygen for 50 years. - Sir? - Yeah? I saw Porter with Rainey and Detroit the other day. Very animated conversation. Get Rainey and Detroit into my office ASAP. Yes, sir! - Time check, boys? - We are four hours. - How much air we got left? - Two hours at the most. - Get back! - Go, go, go, go! Move it! Go! Get down! Where's the crowbar? Give me that. It's gonna jam up here. Well, you two, were seen with them recently. And I wanna know, what they are up to. Sir... We are super friendly individuals. We talk to just about anybody. It is harder to remember one from another. Lieutenant, if you withhold information from me, I will see to it that this man straps his ass into a cockpit ever again. Sir, with all due respect... Stop right there, Lieutenant. In my experience, when a man rephrase a statement with the phrase with all respect, he is about to say something disrespectful and quite possibly stupid. Are you certain you wish to continue. - Sir, yes. - Be my guest. This man received 14 medals for heroic and meritorious acts. Once flew an FA-18 in battle one of his engines blown off, he refueled mid-flight, because he knew if he returned to the base, he would be grounded. The point is Detroit Turner is the best pilot the Navy has. Well I believe you might be right, Lieutenant. I need you. I do not need you, however. - Petty officer Clearwater? - Sir? Prepare discharge papers for Lieutenant Rainey. Yes, sir! You are suddenly uncharacteristic quite Lieutenant. You sure there is not something you'd like to share with me? Keep going. So, me and Porter are gonna go down first. Alright? Then you two. Understand? - You are friends for a long time? - Can't remember the time we weren't. I see sadness in him. - Yeah, well, we all got our troubles, Lara. - His is at home. His wife. He does not talk about it anymore. Not even to me. What happened? Two years ago his wife got into a car accident. She survived. Their little girl, Billie... She didn't. She was three. Went home to bury her. And after that nothing was same between them. Matt just... Matt just can't forgive her. So, now she done nothing to say, huh? JP! And what about you, lover boy? No comment? JP, enough! What? It was a waste of time. There's nothing down there. - I don't understand. - Let me explain to you. - There was no gold! - Alright, cut it out, boys. - Lara, it's not your fault. - What? - It is her fault. - JP, It's not her fault. It was a story told to a kid. To any kid that would look like a lot of gold. Village must have flooded before they got it out of the trucks. The gold must be scattered all over the valley. It's another story, Stanton? At least we got ourselves 10 bars of Gold! Alright? That is a hell of a lot money for me. And for us. - And for you. - Good point Duffy. - Great, great. I'm getting out of it. - You're getting us all out of here. Super C-8, this is F-150. What is your status? We're about lift off, brother. See you all soon. - What's going on, chief? - The wall down there with Latin words... It's wrong. The stone is upside down. Grab that. Let's smash away through that wall and see what's behind. Gear up! Throw the explosives. - Everybody all right? - You are okay? - No way to tell, how many are up there. - Does not matter. - Let's finish the job we're doing, alright? - All right, let's move. Lower, lower! So, remind me again, who did the math? And how much air do we need down here huh? - Oh yeah, the Math genius. - I'm sorry, I didn't count enough. With some crazy Serbs shoving grenades at us, OK? It's called a contingency plan. Prepare for the worst. There are boy scouts who know this, for crying out loud. You're breathing air, right? That's because of this Math genius. So, why don't you just shut your mouth and stop hogging my half of the air? I'm gonna buy you a calculator for your next birthday, you know that, Ben? A nice big calc... - Hey, Lara. - Hey. - You alright? - Yeah. Okay. - And you too, Ben? You alright? - I'm fine. - Good. - I'm fine. We'll need little more air to get to the surface. - There is a couple of tanks in the trash. - Great. - I'll go with you. - No, stay here. Alright? Stay here. - Hey dude? - Yes? We need way more air. Hey, Porter, do not even start with that OK? - Nice! - You ready? Alright, we got enemies on the surface and no primary... - So what? We use the secondary. - All right. Here we go. Watch for signs of decompression sickness. We're good, we're good We got this. Straight ahead! Shit! Give it to me. Shit! I always said I will go out with a bang. Time to feed the fishes, assholes. Nice shot! Yeah! Heads up! You degenerates do realize, as you would be dead if I had not sent Detroit to the rescue. - Thank you sir. - I am not interested in a "Thank you". But I want you to present a goddamn explanation. And I tell you what you can start with this... Since when the US Navy SEALs bring a civilian female along on a mission? Shut up! Finish the decomp and get your butts up to my office! Yes, sir. Is that what goes on around this base on a day to day basis? Taking civilian female out for a little troll? Little spin in our humvee and in our chopper? Jesus Christ! This Navy is not what it used to be! Not by a goddamn country mile. So you thought, you could just steal all that gold and get away with it? On my watch? No, sir. We were gonna give you a full report, sir. - Were you now? - Yes, sir. As soon as the gold was secured. - Do I look like a moron to you, Barnes? - Yes... No, sir. No, I'm sorry sir. Let me ask you simple to this. What did you plan to do with 27 tons of gold bars? - Put it in your socks? - Sir, turn over it to the people of Bosnia. As a way helping rebuild their country. Sir. OK, hold on. Just... Just a second. I might cry. No, I don't think I will. You realize you broke damn near every oath you took when you decided to embark on this little escapade? Yes, sir. Now, I suppose I can spin this in a positive light, emphasize that the operation lead us Petrovic, one of the biggest stones in NATO's side. How much are we talking about here? I mean in US dollars? Sir as of yesterday's exchange rate 24 tons of gold bars will be 302 million dollars. 302 million dollars. That's a lot of money, isn't it? In the midst all the chaos we are facing in this conflict, this operation clearly demonstrated what can be accomplished through the carefully planned and executed efforts of the US military. Thanks to the heroic and selfless acts of this team of US NAVY SEALs and their local contacts, I can now announce that this gold, stolen by the Nazi regime 50 years ago, and valued at 150 million US dollars, will soon be returned to its rightful place in France. And now, ladies and gentlemen, the Prime Minister of France will present Lara Simic with the Legion d'Honneur. Well this is your lucky day, ladies. And actual lady. - Do you know why it's your lucky day? - No, sir. Because my despicable brother-in-law, who also happens to be my financial adviser and broker, was able to unload those gold bars that somehow did not find their way back to France. I'll now distribute... your shares of this momentous heist. - Moran. - Thank you, sir. - Duffy. - Thank you very much, sir. - Porter. - Thank you, sir. - Barnes. - Thank you, sir. Baker. Ms. Simic. Sorry, but don't these make your lucky day? So, we do all the work, he gets the spoils. - You gotta be kidding me. - Do I look like I'm kidding? Have I ever looked like I was kidding? You're lucky you get that, not a court Marshall. Thank you. You're welcome. Well, that's what you philanthropists wanted, isn't that right? - Yes, sir. - Excellent. Then we should all be happy as clams at high tide. - Dismissed. - Thank you, sir. This... This belongs to you too. Lara? This also belongs to you. If I could just get like a flat or something with my name on it, or like a bronze bust, even a bowling alley or something, it would be great, thanks. There you go. It's yours. We did it. You are okay there, sir? Your eyes seem to be watering. Dismissed! Come on, cowboys. I am buying. - Oh yes. - Yes ma'am! Alright, enough, Off to the bar. Subtitled by Clarity Resync by GoldenBeard
