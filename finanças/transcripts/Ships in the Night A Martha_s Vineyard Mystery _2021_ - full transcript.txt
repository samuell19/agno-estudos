Are you ready, Dad? Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow! Almost, almost. Ow, ow, ow. Ow! Oh! Okay. That's just a small wound. I think the antiseptic'll do the trick but I want you to come to the hospital tomorrow so I can give you a tetanus booster. You have anything for wounded pride? She must've gotten her brains from her mother. Let's see. Oh, excellent work, doctor. Thank you, Eli. You know, when I left Royal Fern Hospital after 30 years, I worried what might happen to the place, and now I can see it couldn't be in better hands. That's because you taught me everything I know. Oh, you flatter me, but do go on. I thought this was a fishing trip, not a medical conference. Bah. I'll bring the car down. Okay. Want me to take that? Thanks. Oh, hang on. I forgot my hat. It was really nice seeing you today, Eli. I'm glad you and your father could join me. I don't get out to fish much anymore. It seems like retirement has you busier than ever. You still tinkering with that dialysis machine? Actually, I've got a working prototype. Congratulations. That's amazing. Knowing all the people it could help, it's really the most rewarding feeling. I'm not even seeking a patent. I'm going to share the design. Open source, as the computer folks say. Eli, you are inspiring and that is not flattery. That's just the plain truth. Thanks, Zee. Why don't I take you for lunch this week to celebrate? That would be lovely. Okay. Thursday, one o'clock at the Blue Dog? It's been ages since I've been there. I'll look forward to it. Ditto. Thought I might find you here. Guilty as charged. Are you making house calls now? I mean, as your doctor, I do strongly approve of the cardiovascular activity. All those fried clams are starting to catch up with me. Too many dinners home alone, I guess. I'm so sorry that I had to cancel at the last minute. You know, it would be tragic if fate was conspiring against us. Yeah, it would be. So how about we try again tonight? Lucky's on Main? It sounds like a plan. Hey, let me know if this running causes any pain in your back. I don't want that bullet migrating any closer to your spine. So far, so good, doc. Man. Any word from that detective friend of yours in Boston about finding the guy who put it there? And he's still looking into it. So did you need something or did you just miss me? Don't you have fishing nets hanging in your living room? Ah, yes. My dad's idea of home decor. I was hoping I could borrow them. I'm actually helping Britt organize the opening auction for the regatta. It's a nautical theme. Shockingly original. Says the mainlander with fishing nets hanging in his living room. I'll help you take them down. Hold your horses there, doc. I still have two miles to go before I earn that lobster and mash at Lucky's tonight. I can drop 'em by later. Jeff. Don. Doing okay? You know CPR, right? Maybe you want to join me next time. You know, I'll stick to providing the cold beverages at the end. Help yourself. Oh, thanks. Hey, you run into some trouble? Yeah, I was gonna test the chorus for the regatta and then a couple of yahoos blew past me on the channel. The wake took me into a piling. Wow. You gonna have it fixed for the race on Sunday? The patch will cure in time. That orbital sander I loaned you, maybe it could make its way back to me. No problem. That's not even the biggest issue. Center board? Cracked clean through. Ouch. Can you get a replacement in time? I'm gonna pick one up in Boston. I got to head up there on Thursday and make a delivery for work. So how are things over at the gallery, anyway? Status quo. You sure about that? I don't know. I'm just realizing I've been there going on 10 years. I never thought when I took a facilities and shipping manager job that I'd have a career in the art business. Yeah. It's funny how we end up in places we least expect. Hey, you think they might have something that would look good over my fireplace? You the market for some fine art there, Jackson? I don't know. Thought maybe it was time to spruce the place up a bit. Ah, maybe there's someone you're trying to impress. What? No. Just wanting to take advantage of your employee discount. Can't help you there. You know, this is pretty bad. We're expecting big crowds for regatta weekend, which means a good haul for the yacht club scholarship fund. I'm glad to hear it. Not so many local kids get the chance to sail. Yeah, so long as the bank put an auction come off without a hitch, which falls entirely on me, of course. Britt, didn't you volunteer? Chief, that only makes it all the more stressful. Thank you, Zee, for stepping in to help. Oh, of course. And Jeff will be here any minute with those fishing nets. How, uh, how are things going between you two? This is the part where I pretend not to be listening. Dad, the harbormaster's over there. Don't you two have pedestrian lanes, and... Yes, yes we do. I'll catch up to you later. Okay. Well? Spill the tea. Jeff! What I miss? Not a thing. Glad you could make it. When duty calls. So where do you want these? Shoot. My friend was supposed to pick up a painting for the auction, but she's stuck at work. I can do it. I don't know if it'll fit in your car. Mm, yeah, sure wish I knew someone with an SUV. Oh, if only. I'd be happy to pick it up. Jeff, you're a lifesaver. I know. You know the Winchester Galleries, right? Yeah, sure. My buddy Don works over there. Ask for Lila Winchester. She'll know all about it. Zee, we have so much to do. I guess we better get to it. I guess so. Welcome to Winchester Galleries. Hi. Are you Lila Winchester, by chance? I am. And you are... Jeff Jackson. I'm here to pick up a painting for Britt Prajna. I don't recall Ms. Prajna making any recent purchases. Well, that's because it was a donation to the regatta auction. You know, for the yacht club fundraiser thing? Excuse me. Please don't touch that. Apologies. Do you need assistance? Yes. I'd like to buy this sculpture. I'm sorry. "Boat Into Wind" has been pre-sold to a buyer in Paris. Oh, I just adore this piece. I have to have it. I understand, but all of Carl Kilburn's pieces are currently sold out at the moment. I'll give you a double what you're asking for it. That's not how I do business, but I'd be happy to show you the work of other artists. No, thank you. Forget about it. Does that happen often? Art is intended to provoke passion. Well, then there's hope for a bidding war at the auction. Did you have a painting in mind or should I just grab one off the wall? I don't know anything about a donation. My gallery manager, Bernadette Orwell, she would've handled all the details and she's not here. Anyway you can reach her? She's having lunch at the Whaler's Club. She'll be back in an hour. Gotcha. Well, thanks, Lila. Of course, and lovely meeting you, Jeff. Ah, I think that's him. - Hey. - Hey. So I talked to a woman named Lila, interesting lady, but she has no idea about a painting being donated to the auction. Uh-oh, sounds like someone got their wires crossed. Well, if Britt wants to uncross them, she needs to talk to Bernadette Orwell, the gallery manager. Lila says she's having lunch at the Whaler's Club. Oh, that's right by us. Okay, thanks, Jeff. Sorry about that. Um, looking forward to dinner. So am I. Where's he taking you? Lucky's. Candlelight, linen, not eating with your hands. Jeff's upping his game. Maybe he likes the lobster there. Oh, I'm sure he likes that, too. To my amazing, incredible, and beautiful wife Bernadette. Mm. Ah, I called ahead and ordered that chocolate souffle you like. Derek, I'm sorry. I'm actually gonna have to cut this short. There's just some stuff that came up at the gallery this morning. The purpose of this lunch was to carve time away from work and spend it together. I know. So you can see how leaving early to go back to work is a problem. Derek, you're being dramatic. Dramatic? You're out the door at the crack of dawn. Half the time you're not home till midnight. There's just a lot going on. And what about our marriage, Bernie? Is that going on? Is that happening? I wanted to wait to talk to you about this. What's that mean? You know what? It was mistake to bring it up. Let's just not get into it here. Bernie, what are - you talking about? - Stop it. Bernie, hi. Britt. Nice to see you. You know my husband, Derek. Of course. And this is Dr. Zee Madieras. Hi. I hope we're not interrupting. You're good. I'll get the chocolate souffle to go. You can get the check. Excuse me. Bernie, I'm so sorry to have intruded. What can I do for you? I spoke to Lila a few weeks ago and she agreed to donate a painting for the regatta auction, but now she seems to forgotten all about it. Of course she has. You should have arranged things with me. Oh, Britt. Bernie is the woman behind the woman. We should have known to come to you. Is there any way you can make this happen? Bring your tax exempt paperwork to the gallery tomorrow at 9:30 in the morning. Lila agreed, it's for a good cause. I'll work something out. Thank you, Bernie. Thank you so much. 9:30 sharp. Yes. Nice work. I was on the chamber of commerce with her for a year and she's challenging. I think her husband would agree. Yeah. Hey. Jeff Jackson, party of two. Mr. Jackson. Lila. Nice to see you again. This is Adam Shearin. - Pleasure. - Hi. Are you an artist? No, no, no. I'm a client. Adam works in Silicon Valley. Wow. That's quite a commute. Yeah, well, my company's based out of there. Shearin Technologies? We've got subsidiaries all over the world now. Is that right? Uh-huh. I'm what they call a digital nomad. I can work wherever I want, so I just decided to buy myself a little summer cottage up here. And I'm helping him get set. That's right, she's filling up my house with her gallery's artwork while I learn to pilot a minor boat. And what about you, Jeff? What brings you to the island? Early retirement. Shearin, party of two. Lila, I think our table's about ready. Nice seeing you, Jeff. Likewise. Nice to meet you, Adam. - Hey. - Hey. Let me guess, you're running late. You're not going to believe this. Dr. Cho got food poisoning and I'm the backup. I'm so sorry. Don't apologize. It's not your fault. Can we please do this later this week? Yes, we can and we will. In the meantime, I'm gonna have a little chat with fate. Tell him to get out of my way. Please do. Did you get the painting situation worked out? Oh, that reminds me. Are you free tomorrow morning? I'll be there. That'd be great. Thanks, Jeff. Anytime. Night, Zee. Goodnight. Boston Police, Detective Lau. Andy, it's Jeff Jackson. If you're calling to buy me a beer at Callahan's, the answer is I'll see you in five minutes. Sadly, I'm a little more than five minutes away. Rain check? Fine. I guess I'll keep working this cold case. Tracking down the perp who shot my friend. Which is why I'm calling. You find anything? I've been able to ID 11 criminal associates of the bank robber you took down, known as 38 Special. Can you tie any of them to the scene? Not yet. So far, their whereabouts are all accounted for. Huh. But I'm still working through the stack, Jeff. Well, if you wanna lighten the load, you can send some of those files my way. Sure, as soon as you unretire and rejoin the police force. Always by the book, huh, Andy. Always. Hey, the next time I see you, I'm gonna have a cooler full of fresh-caught crabs with your name on them. Sounds great, Jeff. And as soon as I got something, you'll know. Thanks, Andy. Kelly! Hey there, Jeff. Jackie. I was just thinking about you. Lucky me. I was hoping you were working on something that I could report on for the "Gazette." Right now, I'm working on caffeinating myself. You looking to buy a new place? Looking to sell one, actually. Hopefully several. You're selling real estate now? Well, it may shock you to hear, but working at the "Gazette" hasn't exactly made me rich. You're not in the market, are you? No, no. I'm good where I'm at, thanks. Well, if you change your mind, you know where to find me. Bob. Missed you yesterday, Jeff. Yeah, I got caught up running errands. Day kind of got away from me. For you, my darkest roast. Keep you from dozing off while you got that line in the water That's the plan, but first I gotta pick up something for Zee and Britt over at the Winchester Galleries. Lila's got a great eye. Some very fine pieces over there. What, are you an art critic now? I'm just playing delivery man. I gotta pick up a painting from Bernie Orwell. Ooh. Best mind your Ps and Qs with her. Oh yeah? Bernie comes in here every morning by eight for a double-shot Americano. Never tips and doesn't like chit-chat. That's a direct quote. Thanks for letting me know. You know what? She actually hasn't been in here yet today. Well, you best have her triple shot ready. See you later, Bob. Yeah. Sounds good. Come on, come on! You doing okay there, Don? Jeff. Yeah, nothing's working right all of a sudden. What's up. No, I was just about to head over to the gallery. Got your orbital sander. Right. Thanks. So what's going on here? I got a ferry leaving in 15 minutes, I got a load of gallery items need to be in Boston today, now this thing won't work. Yeah, well, it looks like your battery cable's corroded. Sea air'll do that. Shouldn't take long to replace. Yeah, but I'll never make my deliveries and pick up my center board if I miss this early ferry. Here. Take the old Wagoneer. I'll fix up the van, drive it till you get back. Seriously? Yeah, it's at least I can do after taking your sander hostage for a week. Thank you, Jeff. You're a lifesaver. Let me just get the packages loaded up. I gotcha. You got a hammer? Looks like this lid needs to be nailed back down. Yeah, you know what, I'll take care of it at the customer's house. All right. You better get the lead out, Don. You got a ferry to catch. Yeah, working on it. We are five minutes early and I brought every piece of paperwork we have. Bernie's a stickler. You and Jeff stay late at Lucky's? I wish. I stayed late at the ER because Dr. Cho called in sick Things keep getting in the way of our dinner plans. Think it's a sign? I mean, I sure hope not. Ah, speak of the devil. Hey, we're just walking up to the gallery now. I'm a few blocks away at the marina. Are you still working on your boat? Not exactly, but ironically I will be driving the Winchester delivery van today. Okay. Well, how'd that happen? Fate also has a sense of humor, I guess. That's weird, it's locked. Oh my gosh, Zee, look! Jeff, one sec. I have to call you back. What's wrong? Someone in the gallery's hurt. I'm on my way. How do we get in? Is she... She's dead. What's going on? You okay? Yeah. You all right? It's Bernie Orwell. Gallery manager. There's a skull fracture. She has blunt force trauma. What are you guys doing here? We called it in. I was in the neighborhood. What happened? We came to meet with Bernie this morning. When we got here, the door was locked and we could see her on the floor, so I used a chair to break the glass to get inside. And that's what triggered the alarm? Yeah, we were hoping we could help her but we were way too late. I mean, it's a rough guess, but she was probably killed around midnight. So this is a homicide. Yeah. I'll get forensics down here. When the EMTs get her to the morgue I'll do the autopsy. Well, in the meantime, let's take a look around. Looks like someone took out the security system, tried to cover their tracks. Robbery? There's a lot of high end art in here, but I don't think any of it's missing. Maybe Bernie caught them in the act. Possibly, but whoever it was was able to leave without tripping the alarm. Somebody who knew their way around the place. That's what I'm thinking. Dad, do you think you can get any footage off these drives? I'll put Officer Davis on it. He's good, but I wouldn't hold my breath. He's no Jenkins. There's a sculpture missing. It was here yesterday, some kind of abstract sailboat. You think it's connected? Lila Winchester said it has been sold, and Don was taking deliveries up to Boston earlier today. I think you should talk to Lila, Chief. You hold on, JW. Seems like you're a couple of steps ahead of me on this. Only by chance. And yet, there you are. I would really appreciate your help. I'll call once I get the results from the autopsy. And I'm gonna head out to Bernie's house and break the bad news to her husband and ask him some questions. Lila Winchester's place is on the way. Why don't you come along? Sure. Why not? Great. Bernie? Murdered? So it looks like no artwork was missing from the gallery except the abstract sculpture you said was going to a buyer in Paris. Did Don take that piece to Boston this morning? No, he, he took another sculpture from the series. So the original "Boat Into Wind" will still be in the gallery. This is looking more and more like a robbery. Jeff, do you remember that woman who was so adamant about buying it? Yeah, I do, and I already told the chief about it. We're working on getting a positive ID. But we don't have an awful lot to go on. You sure you didn't catch her name? No, no, but she wasn't local. I've lived here 20 years. I've never seen her. Lila, who has the security code for the gallery alarm? Me, Bernie, and Don. But to be honest, I haven't changed it since it was installed, and I've had a few employees come and go over the years. Well, I'll need the names, if you can. Of course. When's the last time you saw Bernie? Last night. She was still at the gallery when I left around eight to go to Lucky's, where I saw you. Did you talk to her at all after that? She called. She called, while Adam and I were having dessert. She had a billing question. If you could find the time of that phone call for us. Uh, 9:24. We talked for one minute. So she called on the landline. How late did you stay at Lucky's, approximately? I got home around 10, so maybe I left around 9:40 or so. Lila, I don't mean to be callous, but I've heard that Bernie was, well, that she rubbed people the wrong way. She wasn't always tactful, but... Point being, was there anyone that you can think of who might want to harm her? Not like that. No. Were the two of you close? I have the vision and she, she had the business savvy. We complimented each other. That's rare and precious. I'm sorry. It's okay. Oh, Chief. How is her husband, Derek, doing? He's my next stop. Poor man. Don, it's Jeff Jackson. Call me back when you get this. It's important. Voicemail. You know him. Is he capable of this? Don's a friend, but how well do you ever really know anyone? What I can tell you is that if Don wanted to steal that sculpture, he could've done it any time. True. And why only steal "Boat Into Wind"? I mean, there's gotta be hundreds of thousands of dollars' worth of artwork in there. And the killer only takes one piece? Right. Well, Officer Davis is checking out hotels trying to run down our mystery woman. Let's me and you go see Derek Orwell. Chief. Isn't Derek's place on your way home? Yeah. It's past 10. Think he'd be wondering where his wife is. No calls or texts from him on Bernie's phone. Chief Madieras. Derek. You okay? Yeah, it was just sound asleep. What, what can I do for you? Who is this? Jeff Jackson. I'm a friend of the chief's. Do you mind if we come in? Uh, yeah, sure. Come on in. Murdered? How? She was found at the gallery. The autopsy is underway right now. Oh, this isn't happening. This isn't happening. Did you have some company over last night? No. Did you go out? Maybe go by the gallery to check on Bernie? Am I a suspect? Derek, these are standard questions. You and Bernie were seen arguing at the Whaler's Club. Yes, and we planned to talk about it when she got home. It's evidence that I was waiting. But it didn't strike you as odd that she never showed up? It would've been odd if she had. She works, worked a lot. Her job came first. Always. Derek, I know this is hard. When was the last time you spoke to her? Oh, I don't know. It's Don Samuels you should talk to. Was there some problem between them? Not specific, you know, just, just a gut feeling, you know. Well, we'll be sure to talk to Don. That's Zee. She's ready. Derek, we're very sorry for your loss. Chief Madieras, can I, can I see her? Soon, Derek. We'll let you know. And I was really looking forward to it, so I'm really sorry. Hopefully we can reschedule for next week. Anyway, let me know what works for you. Least I know I'm not the only one getting canceled on. No, you're still on the hook for sometime this week. Ooh. That was Eli Leichtner. And how is Dr. Leichtner? His voicemail's fine. We were gonna have lunch, but that obviously has to wait. So what have you got? The time of death was between 9 and 11, and in addition to the blow to the head there are these bruises on her arms. Those look like defensive wounds to me. I agree. She was definitely fending someone off. Look at the shape of those contusions. She was hit with an object. Do you think it might've been the sculpture? It could be it's missing not because it was stolen, but because it's the murder weapon. If I knew what it looked like I might be able to match it to the wounds more definitively. We can reach out to the sculptor. Didn't Lila say it was Carl Kilburn? Oh, Carl? You know him? He's an islander. He was a year ahead of me in school. David. Y'all, good work. Stay there. Yeah. So our mystery woman who wanted to buy "Boat Into Wind"? She's staying at the Lantern Post Inn. Name's Suzanne Dillon. Did Davis pick her up? She's not there. He's gonna stake out the lobby. But in the meantime, why... Why don't Zee and I go visit her old Vineyard High School classmate? It's almost like you're a detective working this case. Maybe I just like the company. Huh. Not you, Chief. Carl. Hey. Zee! - Hey. - Hey. - Um... - Wow. This is, uh, Jeff... Oh. Sorry, it's a little better. This is Jeff Jackson. Oh, hey. How are you? - Hey. - Hey. Wow, it's been a long time, Zee. - I know. - Yeah, what brings you by my studio? We were hoping you had a duplicate of a sculpture in the Winchester Galleries. "Boat In The Wind"? Oh, well, I don't have a duplicate, but it's part of a series, yeah. It's right up the stairs. Come on up. Don't mind the mess. It's been pretty busy. This is "Boat Into Wind Three." You guys looking to buy? Can I ask you what it's made of? Hollow cast aluminum. It's a two-piece mold with a hidden seam that is practically invisible. It's been a process for me. Most of my previous sculptures were a solid cast. Why the change? Well, the gallery has buyers overseas who wanted a nautical piece, but needed them to be lighter in weight. I made the first two in the series but I think they got shipped off. A Don Samuel ship went off earlier today, but the original, it's missing. What's this all about? I think we have a match. That's somebody's arm. Are you gonna tell me what's going on? We're consulting for the police on a homicide. It looks like one of your sculptures was used to commit a murder. It's strange that Bernie didn't give me a call to tell me that... What? Bernie was the victim. Bernie? Were you two close? Lila found me, but it was because of Bernie that my career really took off. Been able to make my living as an artist. Yeah, I owe her a lot. I'm so sorry, Carl. Seemed to take that pretty hard. It's a lot to take in. So what's our next move? I don't know about you, but I could use some liquid motivation. Before five? Coffee. Ah. Thanks, Bob. Terry Pratchett once wrote, "Coffee is a way of stealing time." So enjoy, and if you run short of time, refills on the house. Oh, you're both wise and generous. Just doing my small part to help. Have you two paid a visit to Carl Kilburn yet? Why do you ask? Carl seemed to be a bigger fan of Bernie than, well, just about anyone else. She wasn't exactly known for her charm. That's very diplomatic of you, Zee. How'd he take the news about Bernie? He's pretty shaken up. Thought so. You two making any headway? We're still looking for a motive. Ah, yes. The why of it all. The existential question. In my experience, the simplest explanation is usually the right one. Jeff Jackson, pragmatic philosopher. Is that Don? No, it's your dad. Should I feel slighted that he's calling you instead of me? I doubt it's about dinner plans. What's up, chief? I need you guys to come down to the station. We're 10 minutes away. You got something? Caught up with our mystery woman. It's time to get some answers. Suzanne Dillon, your driver's license says you're from Palo Alto. I run a venture capital firm in Silicon Valley. I'm here on vacation. Any chance you know a guy named Adam Shearin? I know he runs Shearin Tech, but I don't know him personally. You said this was about a murder. Well, I was at the Winchester Galleries the day you offered the owner double for a particular sculpture. It's now missing. We suspect it was the murder weapon. That's awful. Why'd you want it so badly? I'm impulsive and I thought it was undervalued. Can you tell us where you were last night between 9 and 11? In my hotel room. Can anyone verify that? The front desk, they brought me my room service. Do you know Bernie Orwell? Who's he? She is the gallery manager. Also the woman who was murdered last night with the sculpture you wanted but couldn't have. And you think I... Are you joking? If I'm being accused of theft and murder, I want to talk to an attorney. Well, that's your right, but if I could have a look at your hotel room, prove you have nothing to hide, you could save us all a lot of trouble. Oh, by all means. Let's go to the inn. Let's get this over with. All right. Good to see you. Yeah. I'll be right with you. Miss Dillon, are you okay? That's a really serious rash you got there. Oh, I'm a doctor. I'm fine, thank you. It's a side effect of ramipril. I take it for blood pressure. I'll let you know if I turn up anything at the hotel. - Okay. - Right this way, please. Still no word from Don? No. Are you starting to worry? It's just not like him. I think maybe I'll swing by his house. Why don't I follow you? I can keep you company till my shift starts. Okay. Thanks. Yeah. What are you doing? Get down. What's going on? Someone just tried to kill me. This is why Don hasn't been returning my calls. He forgot to take his phone to Boston. There's an earlier message from an unknown caller just like the one that called before the shot. I know what you did. Is that Derek Orwell? Davis, take this phone. See if you can get the service provider to ID that caller. JW, you okay? That's not the first time I've been shot at. Sorry I pulled you into this. Don't be. And at this point, I'm gonna see it through. Let me see that bullet. It's a rifle caliber. Eight millimeter. That's probably why you didn't see the shooter. He could have been two, 300 yards away. Just waiting for you. Not me. Not you? I was in Don's van pulling up to Don's house. Somebody wanted to kill Don. And that phone rang the second I pulled up. Would've been the perfect way to pin him to that seat, and bam. Makes sense. And Chief, did you notice the gun collection in Derek Orwell's house? I did. Chief. Cell carrier says the number belongs to Derek Orwell. On the money, JW. Let's go find him. Derek Orwell, Vineyard PD. Open up, Derek. We need to talk. We should go check around back. Still waiting for a warrant. I don't have probable cause. Well, then you're lucky I don't officially work for you. Open up, Derek! Get off me. Take it easy, Derek. Cops are right behind me. Let's go! Let's go, move it! Over here. JW, you all right? All good. Derek Orwell, you're under arrest. You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can and will be used against you - in a court of law. - You all right? I'm getting pretty good at dodging bullets. Before I ask you any questions, before you get clammed up and ask for your lawyer, why don't you just listen? Ballistics just matched the bullets from your MAUSER to the one we pulled out of Don Samuels' van. And not only are there fingerprints on the gun, but also on the casing... From the bullet that almost took my head off. You? I was driving Don's van, Derek. I guess we're both lucky you didn't kill me. Why were you driving his van? The better question is why were you trying to kill Don? Because he killed my wife. Why do you say that? I figured it out after you guys came by. Then I knew what I had to do. Whoa, Derek. Look, do me a favor, okay? Since you almost killed me? Start from the beginning. What makes you think Don killed Bernie? For the past couple months, she'd been working late more and more. Then at lunch, it sounded like she wanted to end things. So when she wasn't home by 8:30, I drove down there. To the Winchester Galleries. I saw Don's van parked in the alley and I went in and I heard them arguing. He was telling her, he was pleading with her, telling her, "We're perfect together." I should have confronted them. Instead I went home, got drunk. It was only later that I realized maybe she was ending it with him, not me. So he killed her. That's quite a leap, Derek. Is it? Have you talked to Don? We're having trouble locating him. And yet you're driving around in his van? What's going on? What's going on is we're trying to find out who killed your wife, okay? And we're charging Derek with the attempted murder but the question is, had he already succeeded in killing his wife? Well, he already lied to us. So it's possible that last night, Derek was at the gallery waiting for Don to leave before he went back in to have it out with Bernie. Things got heated. She ends up dead. Right, crime of passion. He starts with Bernie and then he tries to finish with Don. Exactly. You know what would really help right now? I know, talking to Don. Thanks for the lift. No worries. Doctor, medical examiner, Uber driver. What can't you do? Yeah, I'm a woman of many skills. Is interior decorating on the list? 'Cause my walls are looking pretty sad. Don't worry, Britt and I will get your vintage fishing nets back to you soon. Speaking of fish, you hungry? I mean, we could do that dinner now. Jay Jackson has a terrific late night menu. Oh, it's tempting, but to be honest, I'm beat. Yeah. Yeah. We could use a rest. Yeah. Rain check. Okay. Hey, Jeff, are you sure you're all right? A lot happened today. I'm just thankful to be alive. When I heard that shot go off on Derek's back porch... You thought I'd be walking around with another bullet in me. Not funny. I was worried about you. Good. Night, Zee. Goodnight, Jeff. Morning, champ. Chief. You're here bright and early. Guess who we picked up coming off the first ferry of the day? Let me guess. My good buddy Don Samuels. Bingo. I'm glad he finally turned up. He's got some explaining to do. Jeff, what's going on? Am I in some kind of trouble? Why don't we start with what you've been up to since I saw you last? Well, I barely made that ferry to Boston, I made my deliveries, picked up the center board. Went to call the gallery, that's when I realized I left my phone in the van. Hey, you saw stressed out I was that morning, so I decided to take the night off, needed to unplug. Went to Faneuil Hall, got a nice steak, checked into a hotel. Were you at the gallery two nights ago, around nine? Yeah. You with anybody? Uh, Bernie. Why? We got a witness who says they saw you two having a heated discussion. A witness? What's this all about? Let's go talk in the office. Bernie Orwell was murdered. Murdered? What happened between you and Bernie that night? Well, this might not make me look very good. Uh, Bernie and I had an argument. Over what? We were gonna open our own place. Leave Winchester Galleries. I was gonna tell you at the dock the other day, but she asked me to keep it under wraps. Did Lila know? We didn't want to tell her until we rented our new space. So who else knew about this? Just the realtor, Jackie Shawl. What was the cause of this argument between you and Bernie? Well, the new gallery was, was Bernie's idea. She said she was ready to break out on her own but she couldn't do it financially, so she sold me on going in with her and I saw it as a investment in my future. I took out a second mortgage. Everything was on track, then the night before last, she says she's backing out. Wow. That must have made you pretty angry, huh? Getting dumped like that. Did she hurt you any other way? What are you getting at here, chief? Was anything else going on between you two, other than business? Absolutely not. Who said there was? Derek Orwell, after he was arrested for taking a shot at me while I was in your van. What? Yeah. So think about this really carefully. Did you see anybody else on Thursday between nine and 11 pm? No, just Bernie. After the fight, I went straight home but when I left, she was alive. He admits to being with the victim around the time of death, but his alibi's really soft. You know him better than I do, JW. What do you think? I think our local investigative reporter's been dabbling in real estate. Jackie Shawl? Yeah, I'm gonna go talk to her, see if she can corroborate Dan's story. All right, and I'll get in touch if we find that missing sculpture either when we search his home or the shipping office. Sounds good. Hey, did I miss something? I'll tell you on the way. Can you drive? My car's still at the ferry terminal. Sure. Where we going? To chat with one of your favorite people. Thanks for meeting us. No problem. Can you confirm that Bernie Orwell and Don Samuels were real estate clients of yours? They were until the other day. Bernie called me the afternoon she was killed and told me that Don was pulling out. Anyway. I asked her if that meant that we were no longer looking for property, and she said, no, she could handle it herself. Did she mention anything about another partner? Nope, and I didn't ask. You're usually so inquisitive. I wear many hats, not unlike yourself. Now, putting my reporter hat back on. What can you tell me about this murder investigation? Bernie's husband thinks that she and Don were having an affair. Have you talked to Carl Kilburn? Why do you ask? The other day I was showing Bernie a property in Oak Bluffs near the hardware store, and while we were pulling into the parking lot, Carl was coming out. Bernie ducked out of sight and asked if we could wait until he was gone. That's strange. You ask her why? I was wearing my realtor hat. All right, thanks chief. We'll let you know what we find. So Davis took a look at Bernie's phone records. The number of calls between Bernie and Carl tripled over the last couple of billing cycles. They were talking nearly every day. And that coincides with the timeframe Derek suspected she was having an affair. Derek may have been right, but he was suspecting the wrong guy. And get this. Last call was made by Bernie to Carl at 8:30 pm the night she died. Okay, so if we believe Jackie, Bernie was definitely trying to avoid Carl. So if they were having an affair... Sounds like the honeymoon was over. You know, why don't we talk to Lila again? See if she can't fill in the details. Yeah. You gonna drive? It's my car. Hop in. Zee, Jeff. Is there news? Not much, but we were hoping we could talk. Of course. Would you like some iced tea? No, thanks. Adam and I were just discussing the final touches for his summer cottage. That's a nice way of saying she's trying to sell me another piece. Oh, our apologies for interrupting. We shouldn't take long. Ah, no trouble. In fact, we were just about through. I'll call you later this afternoon. Sounds good. Oh, Lila says that you two are working with the police on this whole terrible situation Any updates? We're not at Liberty to discuss that just yet. Right. Well, best of luck. Take care, Lila. You, too. Did we just ruin a big sale? No, not at all. With buyers like Adam, it's this long and patient process of cultivating their tastes, building trust. Please, sit. So, Lila. We know you were close with Bernie. Was she having an affair with Carl Kilburn? That's a personal matter. Lila. Now, I think we're worrying about social graces. Don't you? Oh, of course, of course. Forgive me. The answer is yes. She and Carl were involved. You know, you really should've told us that when the chief and I first talked. I'm sorry. I was just trying to protect Bernie's privacy, and Carl and Derek. I reached out to Derek yesterday, but I haven't heard back. That might be because he's in a jail cell. You don't mean he's the one who's responsible for... We aren't sure if he's the one who killed his wife, but he definitely tried to kill Jeff What? Well, technically he tried to kill Don Samuels. I don't understand. Derek knew Bernie was having an affair but he thought it was with Don. Oh, my goodness. I am so sorry. I should have said something, Jeff. I'm so sorry. Bernie and Carl. How long was that going on? Just a few months, but it wasn't gonna last. Bernie told me the other day that she was gonna end things with him, the affair and us carrying his work at the gallery. How did you feel about that? I didn't like it, but we have many artists. There was only one Bernie. So Carl is losing a relationship and a source of income. Sounds like a double motive to me. Carl. Oh, you're back. I was just finishing "Boat Into Wind Four." Carl, why didn't you tell us you were involved with Bernie Orwell? Told you that? What difference does it make? You're not denying it. No, but it's not any of your business. She called you Thursday night at 8:30. Did you meet her at the gallery? Carl, come on. You don't have anything to hide. Just be straight with us. Fine. Yeah. Yeah, she called me. Carl, it's me. We'd need to talk. Call me back when you can. I was working, running heavy machinery. I didn't even know she called until a lot later and I didn't call her back because I didn't want to talk on the phone. Why not? I had a feeling she wanted to end it. So then did you go to the gallery? No, no, I went back to work. Knocked off around 11. Is that right? Okay. Thanks, Carl. Oh, hey. Who'd you make that sculpture for? Lila asked me to replace the one that was stolen. Huh. All right, let's run through our suspects. There's Don. Now, his motive would be Bernie cutting him out of the new gallery, leaving him high and dry. There's Eric and Carl, both jilted, fallout from the affair. Then there's Suzanne... And her strange interest in Carl's sculpture "Boat Into Wind." Ironic. We still don't have a murder weapon. You up for a little dumpster diving? What? I'm not dressed for that. I think you look great. Leaving out the back door makes a lot more sense. It's way too easy to be spotted exiting the front. You're scared, someone could come around the corner at any second. You want to get away and blend in with the crowd on the street. People are gonna notice someone carrying a sailboat sculpture. Yeah. You know the difference between a successful criminal and the ones who get caught? Keeping your cool. You don't want to hang on to proof of your guilt. So you hide the evidence. Huh. Come back to the scene when the investigation's died down. Right. And wouldn't you know it, not a dumpster in sight. What? Bingo. The murder weapon. And maybe more. So they take the sculpture and then they leave it behind. And it's been completely ripped open. Why? You know, there was a case back in Boston where some counterfeiters were moving cash by stuffing it into ceramic bust of Paul Revere. Moved them right through the gift shops. So someone's using Carl's art for smuggling. And this isn't the first piece of Carl's that Winchester Galleries has shipped out. I mean, Lila said that Don took another "Boat Into Wind" the Boston yesterday. You think it's shipped already? I can find out. Jeff, what's up? Don, you got a minute? Whatever you need. That sculpture you brought to Boston yesterday, "Boat Into Wind Two," you have the shipping information on it? Uh, yeah. But it's all pretty standard stuff. High value sea freight shipping out of Boston, Mass. Shipping to Shenzhen, China. Wait. China? Yeah. The recipient is a Jinghua Jishu. Do you know if that's left already? No, it's at the customs house on Conley Wharf, due to ship out by end of day tomorrow. Great. Thanks, Don. No problem. Thanks, Andy. We'll meet you there at two. Okay, so Andy Lau's gonna get a warrant and secure the package for us at the warehouse in Boston. Hey, listen. Why don't you come with me tomorrow? To Boston? Yeah, it seems like the only time we can get together is when we're working a case. Sure, yeah. Boston sounds great. Great. Okay, I'll see you tomorrow. See you then. Hi, Lila. Oh, Zee, Jeff. Can I get you two some coffee? No, we just had a quick question. You said the "Boat Into Wind" sculptures were going to Paris, right? Yes. Why? Well, Don had a different address on his shipping form. Well, Bernie was in charge of that, but she told me Paris. Did she tell you anything else, like the name of the buyer? It was a corporate buyer, um... Was it a Chinese name? No, no. It was, it was French. Maybe they changed their minds if Bernie found a new buyer. Maybe. Okay. Thanks, Lila. Of course. I'm sorry I couldn't be more help. It's all right. What do you think? Something doesn't feel right about it. We have a ferry to catch. Andy. Jeff. Good to see you, man. Me, too. And you must be the doctor. Zee Madieras. Hi. Andy Lau. Happy to hear you're keeping an eye on Jackson here. You know, he's always been a bit of a wild card. Oh, I know. Whoa. Hey, now. Before you to start swapping war stories... As promised. But he is reliable. Any progress on those files I asked you to look into? Right, so I'm gonna go into the customs house and pull that package. In the meantime, you can keep an eye on my crabs and you didn't get those from me. Thanks, Andy. Okay. Anything? No, all these guys were in custody or have rock-solid alibis the night I was shot. So no leads. Got it just in time. I knew you'd come through. Wanna open it? No, we should do that on the Vineyard with the chief. Chain of custody and all that. Speaking of which, here's the transfer documents Anything in those files I didn't see? Nah. I'm sorry. I'll keep looking. I know you will. It's always good to see you, Jeff. And a pleasure to meet you, too, doc. You can call me Zee, and hopefully I'll see you on the Vineyard sometime. Careful. I might take you up on that. Thanks, Andy. You still owe me a beer, Jeff. You got it. - There you go. - Thank you. Amazing. I've always loved this view. Actually, I'm thinking about that nickel tour of Boston you gave me. You know, I used to love that town. Now it's kind of bittersweet. You know? I can only imagine. I'm sorry it didn't work out for you on the other front. Very few things wrap up neatly the way you'd want them to. Yeah. If you ever want to talk about that night, you can talk to me. Yeah, it's not really a story I like to tell. I know. I was chasing .38 special for too long, so I put the word out to every informant I knew. But you'd been told to drop the case Yeah, but you know me. I never listen. So when I got a lead that he was meeting a contact for a new bank job, I thought this is our chance to finally take him down. Kelly, he was laughing at me. You know, he thought we were on a wild goose chase, that I was being played. But he backed me up like a good partner. He followed me into that warehouse. He never would've been there if I just let it go. It wasn't long before we were in the soup. I swear, I could smell trouble coming. I was looking right at him when he went down. I watched it happen, like it was in slow motion. Kelly! Returned fire. Pulled Kelly to safety. Yeah, you did everything you could. No. No, I could've done a lot more. But I got hit. And suddenly everything went so quiet. What is it?? I heard something. A noise, a bullet casing hitting the ground, you know, right after I was hit, before I took down .38 special. Like a bullet, like the nine millimeter that's in your back? A second shooter. If you heard a casing hit the ground, wouldn't forensics have found it? They should have, unless, unless the shooter took it with him. Who would do that? Someone who knew what would happen when forensics arrived. You know, someone with the presence of mind to erase any evidence of them being there that night. So whoever shot you is not some low-level criminal who would've been in Andy's file. No, no, no, no. He was smart, professional. There's more to this, something bigger. And whoever shot me, they were trying to protect it. Forensics found no fingerprints on that sculpture you brought back from Boston. That thing was wiped clean, but they did find something hidden inside. It's not a bomb, but as of now, we don't know what it is. Transfusion tips, fluid exchange pump, filter chamber. This is a portable dialysis machine. It's just like the one Eli was working on for the last year. This has to be his. Was he trying to smuggle it out of the country for foreign production, or... No, he wanted to make it available publicly so anyone could manufacture it. Dad, we have to go to Eli's right now. Eli? Doesn't look like he's grabbed his mail in a few days. Eli! Honey. His workshop is upstairs. Zee, slow down. Eli! Hey, Chief. Looks like there was a struggle. Oh! I'm so sorry. I'm sorry, sweetheart. I found something in here you should see. Look what's inside. Suzanne Dillon. Yup. Your handwriting? Yes. That's my handwriting. So you know Eli Leichtner? Has he made a complaint about me? And what would he have to complain about? Suzanne. Dr. Eli Leichtner is dead. Eli would've complained about the pressure you were putting on him to get access to his portable dialysis machines. And not just for your company, for you. The drug she told you she's on, ramipril? It treats high blood pressure, but it also treats renal failure. You seem pretty itchy. That would indicate high phosphorus levels which is a common side effect of dialysis. My venture capital firm is constantly searching for tech innovations. That's how I heard of Eli. I'm not a candidate for a kidney transplant. I flew here to meet with Eli, to convince him to sell us the device so I could fast-track production. We met at my hotel on Monday, but he refused. Because he wanted to make it available to everyone for free. That's right. So I told him I would stay here for the week in the hopes that he would change his mind. And what about the sculpture? What about it? Well, that day at the gallery, you thought Eli's machine was inside. Why didn't you tell us this when we first brought you in? Why do you think? Bernie Orwell had been murdered. I was afraid for my life. What made you think the device was hidden in that sculpture? I knew the device was in one of Cole Kilburn's pieces but not which one. So I thought I'd buy them all. And who told you where to find it? I have a contact in Shenzhen who has an in with the black market. He learned of a company that was paying off the customs people to pass through shipments coming in from the Winchester Galleries. But why assume it was Eli's device? The company is called Jinghua Jishu. That translates to purification technology. Gotcha. Jinghua Jishu is a subsidiary of none other than Shearin Tech, Palo Alto, California. How'd you figure that out? Well, my Mandarin's not great but your translator app is. I figure any company that imports from the US has got to be registered. So I punch in Jinghua Jishu and bada bing, bada boom. Gotta love the internet. I think Adam Shearin owes us some answers. Adam Shearin. Vineyard PD. Hey, chief. Lila? Oh, you scared me. What are you doing down here? Oh, I'm just cleaning up. I wanted to get a cover on the boat for Adam. Where is Adam? Oh, he left about an hour ago. Poor guy. He had some kind of business emergency. He barely had time to pack and hopped in a taxi and asked me if I could button up his boat, which I was happy to do. I'm gonna call this in, get some officers out to the airport. Yeah, that's probably a good idea. Something wrong? Lila, we think that Adam is connected to a murder. No. No, that's not possible. You don't mean Bernie? Eli Leichtner. Eli Leichtner? You knew him? No, but... I found this under some life preservers. I didn't recognize it. That's Eli's. This places Adam Shearin at the scene. Well, he didn't get on a plane. No sign of him at the airport. Eli Leichtner's. Looks like our killer's on the run. Shearin must've heard we pulled the shipment from the customs house. He knew we'd find the dialysis machine and trace it back to Eli. So this has all been about that device. Look at these emails. Adam was hounding Eli for weeks about selling him the patent. But why would Adam kill Bernie? Well, Bernie told Don and Jackie that she didn't need Don's half of the money for their gallery venture. So you're thinking maybe Adam was her new silent partner? Not a partner. Bernie knew about the smuggling. She wanted to open her own gallery. So maybe she tried to squeeze Adam for the money in order to keep quiet. And instead he killed her. Well, I've already issued an APB, so he's not gonna get far. Shearin's options are limited. When he turns up, we'll get him. Good. We'll get this wrapped up. And I gotta say, thank you both. We couldn't have done it without you. You got it, chief. Something bothering you? Why leave it behind? Why not take it with you? What? Eli's computer, his papers. Two lattes. Thanks, Bob. You seriously make the best lattes. What's your secret? See, to tell you that would violate the barista code. Really? I've already said too much. How'd he know the code? The barista code? No, the security code at the gallery. How did Adam know it? Well, Bernie would've let him in. But the alarm went off when you broke the glass on the door. And the last person to leave the gallery must've reset the alarm. After Bernie was dead. And the lipstick on the glass on Adam's boat. I mean, if he was in such a hurry, why would he take time to share drinks with Lila? Come on. Jeff, Zee. Lila, do you have a minute? Well, I'm actually really... Won't take long. Of course. You going on a trip? Oh, my sister's in San Francisco. After Bernie, I really need to change of scenery. It's kind of last minute for a flight, isn't it? I'm flying private. That's not cheap. But does price really matter when you're on the run? Excuse me? Adam Shearin never made it to the airport. What? But you knew that because you killed him and Bernie, too. How dare you? It started with the prototype for the portable dialysis machine built by my dear friend, Eli. It was a revolutionary piece of technology that would save countless lives. And Adam Shearin decided to kill for it because Eli was going to give it away for free. Adam murdered a kind and generous man just so you could make a profit. Who would lead you to believe such a thing? Actually, it was Bernie who pointed the way. She was a stickler for detail. She noticed that you changed the shipping address for the "Boat Into Wind" sculptures from Paris to Shenzhen. She knew Carl's work well, so she suspected something was off and realized that one "Boat Into Wind" sculpture was heavier than the other. You see, Bernie was planning to open a new gallery with Don but that night, before she was murdered, she suddenly told him that she was backing out of the deal. She didn't need his financing anymore because she had a new source of income. You. You see, you told us that she called at 9:24 with a billing question. But the real question was how much she was gonna bill you and Adam to keep quiet. So you hurried back to the gallery. Maybe you thought you could talk your way out of it. But Bernie was Bernie. There is nothing... She asked too many questions you didn't wanna answer. It got physical. Get your hands off it. And she ended up dead. Which is when you called Adam. He destroyed the security hard drive to cover your tracks. And together you removed Eli's device from the now-damaged sculpture where you'd kept it hidden. Then you wrapped the murder weapon and dumped it close by, thinking you'd dispose of it later. And then you went to your warehouse and moved Eli's machine into the second sculpture, which you knew Don was shipping the next morning. You see, with Bernie dead, your timetable was accelerated. What I suspect was supposed to be a dry run to test out the smuggling plan instead became the real thing. But with millions on the line and two murders in your wake? It was a risk worth taking. You make us sound like a regular Bonnie and Clyde, but your theory falls apart. Why would I kill Adam? Well, you were in it together until we came by to ask about the shipping address. Hi, Lila. When you realized we were getting too close, you decided to make him the fall guy. After you made Adam disappear, we caught you covering it up... Oh, you guys scared me. And you handed us our obvious killer. This is all just speculation. I haven't heard anything yet that proves that I'm even a small part of this whole sordid affair. Well, it's funny you should say that, because it's exactly one small detail that gave you away. An unconscious habit that you probably weren't even aware of. When you left the gallery. You punched in the security code and set the alarm. But Adam didn't know the code. That was your mistake. So you say, but these things are actually determined in a court of law. Yes, they are. They you won't mind if I call my attorney. Stay out of my way. Lila. Don't make things worse for yourself. Oh, the way you've laid it out, I don't think they can be worse. Just put down the gun and tell us your side of the story. It wasn't supposed to be like this. It wasn't. Adam told me, he promised me, he had taken care of everything. And then suddenly he, he said that Eli was dead and I was an accomplice. And then you felt like there was nowhere else to turn. And I knew Bernie was gonna leave me and I needed her far more than she needed me, and over the years I've really come to hate her for that. Then it was a crime of passion. A judge is gonna hear that. Bernie didn't deserve what I did to her, but Adam did and I am getting on that plane. - Now, get out of my way. - Lila, Lila. Think about it. Okay. Where are you gonna run to? Right, you get to the airport, then what? Stop! Lila, shooting us isn't gonna save you. It's over. Just put the gun down. I'm so sorry about Eli. We will have a long time to think about that. Well, nice work, you two. Except for the part where you didn't wait for me to get here. Things were moving pretty fast, chief. At least we called. Coast Guard found a body over by Kings Beach. Description sounded like a match for Adam Shearin. Well, I guess you reap what you sow. Yeah. Let's get outta here. Let's do it. So thanks again for dinner. The lobster special at Lucky's never disappoints. Mm. And I think we've finally put fate in its place. So is there any reason you wanted to go for an after-dinner stroll on this particular pier? No. No. Well, it does bring back some fond memories of one particular night after one particular high school party. And one particularly sweet kiss. I'm glad you feel that way because I just shut my eyes and hoped for the best. Yeah, I'm sure. Britt said that the auction went great and we'll get your nets back to you tomorrow. That's terrific. Yeah, and as a thank you I got you a painting at the action. As far as good causes go, it kills two birds with one stone because that empty wall in your living room's pretty sad. Yeah. I don't know what to say. Say thank you. Thanks. You're welcome.
