I didn't expect it Is not it funny Because you have the same name What do you mean The other girl was also called Shizuko A close friend with Kazue and Yuuka Sizuko went back home suddenly, because she was in failing health.

Sorry About you being angry. Me? What? I can't be angry. I orginally have no heart. Wow! Kazue really works hard. To always train hard ah huh Tokyo Everyone knows that Kazue and Yuuka will be selected. 234 00:23:18,630 --> 00:23:20,790 But still she always works hard Really strange What is there? Come to an end through the grass No one should have been there I heard the sea Liar you said you haven't been Oh ah right No wonder you're going anyway I've never seen the sea once To see across the sea, would Tokyo be there? Is Tokyo reall that nice of a place? Can we go without permission? Yes We can't Where do you plan to go? The sea Isn't it nice? Yes... You Why... are you nice to me? Because you look weak Why is that? And you are a very strange child 4 m 12 Well Yuka Well 4 m 8 (Kazue) Well 3 m 89 One hundred twenty-three 3 m 89 Thank you very much What did I do? I dunno You really say strange things. Look This is the smell of my breath After taking the medicine, its nice Thanks to you anyway Kazue You went to the basement with the lung disease girl Don't bother going there with Shizuko How can people do as they please Isn't it strange you haven't been infected by that tuberculosis. Yuka! Shut up! How can you call her lung disease? How can you be so vicious? Why are you so nice to here? Why should Shizuko be around us? When she imitated us like yesterday. So she should leave? Just disappear overnight? Is that what you're saying? Being nice, to a loser like you, is not what this is about. Look at this. You still bring in a bad mood. Hey! What are you doing? It just came like this. Shizuko What's is it? I'm ok, sorry. Shizuko there's been an accident Eguchi is missing See what you think of this It's randomly littered That's all I can think of No There's no one in the attic or the cafeteria You are responsible for the canteen there Yuka The rest of you follow me Come on Seems the morning began in turmoil What a shame As I said Eguchi was picked up by her biological mother You must feel a deep loss When people leave we worry Anyway please do not be sad I want the usual normal We thought of Shizuko And she was really exactly the same Both were the next to disappear without a trace Because they are monsters Just found this now What I sent her as a gift You also knew, that Shizuko carried this around like an amulet. But she didn't take it Isn't it strange? Why talk about Shizuko now? Tell me You reall don't know anything? You're not hiding anything from me? Maybe Shizuko thought... you weren't that important to her. Maybe she wanted to go to a better place than here. So that's why she just left without telling us. You find it difficult to accept? Are you that special? Eguchi Yeon-deok Yesterday I might have seen Eguchi Even though it was wierd, I think I saw her under the bed. I'm sure it was Eguchi. Forget it. Why? Didn't you wake up from a dream? Don't say stupid things. Yeon-deok Letter To whom You So as to write the facts First write it down Also finish reading your own They are the same regardless of who's. Anyway you sometimes say strange things. Yesterday I heard in the principal's office If you eat this flower You won't run out of breath. How nice it would be if that were true. If the two of us can go to Tokyo You said you saw her before she disappeared? Do you remember what condition she was in? Over there Is Eguchi Kirra Kirra Kirra What was here? You say there was Kirra, and who? Transfer students Don't be overly sensitive Kirra transferred schools this morning It was a tough decision No one told you yet? You said you saw her? No I think I was too sensitive, and imagining things. Maybe the injection isn't working for you? Give it some time to work. If there is any discomfort, and change, you must tell me immediatly Okay Kirra left well. Of course she left well. In the end, we are all going to leave. Why haven't you once ever mentiond Tokyo? You run daily Not because of Tokyo Why? What is Tokyo to you? I'm an orphan I have no place to go But I heard that if was good at running, I could study overseas in Tokyo. So I came here Not because of Tokyo I have no place to go Everyone thinks they'll send you, and Yuka. Do you think so? We don't think like that. It's not that. What I am curious about... Do you want to go to Tokyo with Yuka? I want to go with you Don't you want me too? Sure enough, you're not answering. Is it because of Shizuko? Since I came, I know I'm not as good of a replacement as Shizuko. They don't care about me... Except you... What was that? How did you do that? I don't know. I don't know how I did that. Look at me. Look at me! Look at you? You don't care anyways. Let's talk later. I do not know what will happen. Best to keep this a secret. I feel a bit strange Here Inside Heavy and hot Help me Yeon-deok Sorry I'll go first Shizuko do you have something to say to me? Before I hesitated to say. I don't think I should have anymore injections. hmm I feel I've completely recovered. No more coughing, no more breathing issues, my body feels light. Good. Okay. And... say it's 'ok'. The selection criteria for the best students I would like to know exactly what it is. Shizuko Leave Dine while listening Selection of the best students this semester to send to Tokyo to study. We all remember? Now is time to choose There will be special classes Each person will have one on one counseling And this class Selection of the best students will have a direct impact Students will start from the most likely candidate Candidates are to be reduced to a minimum Then The first person I select is Shizuko Please wait Yeon-deok Congratulations What's the meaning of this? What exactly have you been doing? Look! Look at what you have taken away from me. Die! Die! Shizuko! Yuka! Juran! What happened? Yeon-deok! It's strange. I don't feel pain. Who you are? Who you are? What are you? What are you? Tell me! Say something! What are you doing! What are you doing! What are you? What are you? Stop it. Stop it Kazue. You being so cooperative, I am so grateful, and very happy, Shizuko. Starting today I will teach you for a few classes. Although it is an important process it doesn't have to be a burden. Because you are very good Do not think about anything now Just be comfortable sitting here. She, and Shizuko, are similar. Shizuko ... Shizuko Shizuko This is... strange. I don't feel pain. Yeon-deok Yeon-deok I feel weird Here Inside heavy heat Obviously I came back here. I had to see if she lived, or not. But she disappeared. Disappeared Maybe didn't see properly, or was dreaming. I do not think of other possibilities. Things at school happen so quickly I also believed what I told myself. So everyone, and I forgot. She left without saying good-bye. I'm to blame The information of the disappearances of the girls should be kept separate Shizuko find Kirra How many times do I have to say Other schools were also expected to be later In stages one by one in the past Now that you've got the supplies The timing and manner of prescription, I have the final say The testing of the medicine hasn't been complete yet. Wait for more instructions. The experiment itself is a verification. You do not understand what I'm saying? The so-called process It is still in progress Did you not see the analysis results? Because of negligent management resulting in sending two away you say this is it? The results lead to other children's attention This can also be counted in it? If you are not willing to obey my commands, then withdraw now Anyway, from the very beginning you didn't have a role ─ the final version of the experimental plan Experimental plan Related to body modification Proceed from life control and drug therapy Phased Implementation Actively promote the people's feelings and Body leap upgrades Unable to perceive pain Beyond the physical limits of the human body Develop inherent potential The possibility of super-human ability Physical and psychological aspects Not yet mature girls in experiments are the best Subjects will be trained to be super-human soldiers Information landmark Experiment 1 record images Experimental record images 2 Shizuko It's me As a result I was elected How is this possible Yuka It's dangerous Yuka... No... Yuka don't Sorry I'm sorry Yuka! Get down now! Ok You are not to come out of the dormitory alone. Counselor! Sorry Ombudsman now has to catch up Counselor Cancel all classes, and let everyone calm down. I understand. Yeon-deok I smell rice It's close It should be the village Yuka Thank you You must survive How long has Yuka been like that? About 5 hours So hold on for a while, then we... Gonna record it? Are you crazy? Also how do the dead get shot? Let's finish the semester early. Give her the new medication. Yuka has died.. What a pity. Now you really are the only one If we use this, we won't know what will happen? Yes. Won't it be dangerous? Do you think we are doing safe work? Yes, this time I do not know what will become of the child She might wake up Or even wake up and become what? I do not know either Because they do not know Therefore, in order to clarify Our goal is not clear A teacher's role should be to invest in the possibility of digging. Juran If there is no good material to be found You have to find a new job Really the key is to wait overnight In short it's hard When the results come out, then you can increase support It is necessary to confirm in advance good supplementary items Kato Sanae You are this close Now here under my control After reporting to above decisions Without debate Hey... I'm the principal. You do not know what that means? And How can the military direct school management? If your worried... we have already decided on your replacement. You dare test me (slap) Counselor Quickly asshole Secret documents here Spare my life Kenji. I will work hard... If you give up everything here I have nothing You know very well Why are you so obsessed with this? Money? Or you want fame? I Want to get recognition from Kato Sanae. As a true emperor of the people. A dignified return to the motherland. Damn Korea should rely on their own strength With their own legs I want to get out of here Juran Juran! Juran! Help! Juran! Start leaving now. Leave the remaining students under my supervision. Yes sir. Juran! Thank you My thanks to you Not yet I can not die Shizuko Eguchi Kirra Yuka Yeon-deok Yeon-deok Yeon-deok! No! Yeon-deok Stop! Stay there. This... Even more reckless than expected. I have nothing left to be afraid of. Shoot Shizuko I want to kill you Shoot Don't She is a very important experimental product You can not kill her Guidence She was the first experiment to verify the effect of the new drug Request Support This is important to keep Hello Hello Operator Operator Operator Shizuko Why put something like this into us? What are you talking about Shizuko? You now know it to be much more beautiful, don't you? Yeon-deok It was good for you. You were originally weak, useless, now your not. Yeon-deok Now let's... go home. Do you know what this is? I don't know? Is it this? Looks like it works? It looks like it. Try it Give it a try What's going on? I guess it doesn't work. - It works! - Works! I hope it's an upbeat.
