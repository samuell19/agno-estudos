That mustache is gonna come off when you smile. - Where is the broom? - I've no idea! - Men don't put make up on. - It looks good under spotlights. Ok, then. I sewed this dress right for my size, but in 2 days it's too big again. Should I appear on stage in these glasses? Should I walk like an old man? I want to announce the performers of tonight's play.

In my life, I've played all sorts of roles. I worked as a servant. I acted the servant... to earn money for the family. I worked as a nanny. I acted the nanny. To a certain extent, I become each of these characters. My friends Ayþe and Fatma carry the firewood home as men... and harvest the fields as women. These are all different characters. Their actual character is to be a mother and housewife. While I was trying to figure out what this was all about... I remembered the play the school principal, Mr. Hüseyin, put on. Only then, I realized what I was trying to figure out was theater. Let us make theater too, I said to myself. I went to Mr. Hüseyin and I told him... "I only have a primary school education, but I always loved school. I really want to make theater. "He asked what I meant, so I told him... "Roles will be played by housewives, illiterate women." I said. He asked "What is it going to be about?" I told him: "About our own life." "Do you think you can do that?" he said, and I said "Yes. I do." Everybody put your shovels back. You will take them from here in the morning. Everyone straight to the truck. We'll get back home, change our costumes, make some dinner... grab something to eat, then straight to the school. Everybody is memorizing their own characters. - Kamile you should join us. You're gorgeous. - No way girl. But I live far away, if I was closer... - Besides I can't act. - Why not? All the girls here said the same thing. "We can't do it. We're too shy." I said, "You're smart and hardworking." And look at them now. I could never enter the door of that school. I used to feel ashamed. But now it's like my home. ARSLANKÖY HIGH SCHOOL You said you were going to write down your life stories. Zeynep, what happened to yours? Mine is too tragic. That's why I don't want to tell it. In my style of playwriting... comedy and drama go together. I want to talk about it openly in the play and to act as this character. In two days I can become the character because it's already me. But there's one point I'm hesitant about. We're all sitting here together. I don't want anything coming back to me... about how I'm going around chattering. I'll change the names and characters. If Ahmet beats Mehmet in reality... Mehmet will beat Ahmet in the play. But the message will still come through. Listen to my story. We noticed something under our kid's armpit. The village clinic is miles away from our house. My husband goes away to work. He tells me to take the kid to hospital. I don't have any money to get there. He gives me some change, enough for one way only. I'll have to walk back home. I'm pregnant out to here. Somehow I get there but I've been having labor pain for 3 days. I don't even realize I'm ready to give birth. The doctor examines me and tells that I'm about to give birth in 15 minutes. I've got no money with me. No news from my husband or anybody else. I gave birth all alone. Then my husband comes. I don't even hear a "How are you?" or "Do you need anything?" from anyone. I have 7 stitches. How am I supposed to take care of this baby? I asked to myself, why can't I just die? In that cold at the end of February... I light a fire outside to heat water and give the baby a bath. No one's around, I'm helpless... not a single person to offer a plate of food. But Zeynep, your family is living here. Can't they help? I have problems with my in-laws and... my mother doesn't want to interfere. If God doesn't want to kill you, then he doesn't. I wish this was all a lie. But unfortunately, it's all true. I was in high school. I was in my second year. My brother ran away with a 13-year-old girl. To make up for the crime against the family, they gave me in exchange. They took me out of school. To keep me from running away, they locked me in a room for 3 days. They forced me to marry their son. After 2 months, I separated from him. A year and a half later, I married Alpay, my husband now. He sleeps at home while I collect the firewood or work in the fields. All he cares about is drinking, gambling and women. That's why I made sure my kids finished high school. - Your story is really good too. - As you see, it's like a film. I always kept this to myself. Now it is time to share it. I told my mother-in-law that I was ready to give birth. She told me to be patient. But really I was about to give birth. The baby was about to be born, they finally brought me to the hospital. My husband has no idea what's going on because he's out working. Everyone has a nice long breakfast and I'm crying alone. I can't go on telling it. The same happened when my son was being born. Be patient, they said. We're going to straighten it, right? Mr. Hüseyin says, tell me your life stories, we'll write a play about them. I have no story to tell. Actually my story is much worse than the others. I won't tell it in front of them. I mean, it's a real tragedy. Girl, I didn't even start and you're already crying about it. My father took me out of secondary school. Actually, I wanted to be a literature teacher. One way or the other, I don't care if I'm 35 or 40 years old... I'm gonna finish high school and take the university exam. Just to spite my father. My father is always pressuring me to get married. But I say I won't get married and spend your money. So he gave me to a family in Ankara as a foster child. After some time, I came back here. That's why he's upset with me. When I went there, I was 16 years old. I wasn't speaking to anyone. I didn't want anyone to know I had a village accent. When I finally got over my shyness, I really got used to the city. When I came back to here, I had to get used to the village all over again. For example, the difference between my dressing style and theirs. The other women wear those salwar pants and cover their hair. They say they feel ashamed of themselves when I'm with them. I said not to feel that way at all. Then I should also feel ashamed. My hair was always long. My father never let me cut it. I cut it after I got married and my father didn't speak to me for a while. Because he had a girlfriend whose name was Behiye, the same as mine. She had long hair. That's why he never let me cut it. They name you after their ex-lover... - Nesime, you had that problem too? - You have no idea. My father did his military service in the east where he fell in love with a girl. - And her name was Nesime... - He gave you her name? Yes, he did. - Did your mother treat you bad too? - Of course she did. How she would beat me, whether or not I did anything wrong. - When she finally started to understand my worth... - It was too late. Yeah. But now, she treats me very well. She used to complain, "He named her after that woman... so she'll grow up and be just like her." "Damn her name." That what always came out of her mouth. Is it my fault? It's your fault, you let him name me. One day I decided to see this woman. Well, we went to a wedding. They introduced me to this Behiye. I said "I've always wondered about you." When I saw my father I told "I saw the woman you loved so much. She's not beautiful at all. "He said you should have seen her... when she was young, how beautiful she was. The woman was still telling me to send her love to my father. - Still? - Still. Wow, what love. That's how it should be. Love should be forever. I was forced to get engaged. - And you didn't even want him? - I was 14 years old. - So you didn't accept it. - No, not at all. Me and my friends went shopping. Coming around a corner, I bumped into this man, Rüþtü. - By accident. - Yeah, just by accident. He asked my mother's permission to marry me. She said to him: "My daughter didn't want her fiancé... but I won't give her to you either." He says your mother is not going to let us get married. He asked, "Will you run away with me?" I said, I will. You didn't want the other guy and you said you're going to run away with him. But what were you thinking? What made you decide to do that? How could I accept a forced engagement? But does running away with another guy solve anything? You don't ask yourself such questions. They say you start to regret after the seventh step. Did it happen to you? Maybe not the seventh step, but definitely once we got out of town. I knew nothing about him or his family. As soon as we got out of town I regretted it, that's true. - Get to the point, you're happy now. - Yes, thank God. They say, "Women making theater!" I say why not? There are Women's Rights. Rüþtü, you come up too, I'll fix that part down there. Since she hasn't even finished primary school... she has problems memorizing. Me and my son are helping her memorize her lines. If she memorizes one, she forgets the other. But she doesn't give up. Add a scene in the play to teach a lesson to the mothers-in-law. - Don't mess with mothers-in-law. - You will be a mother-in-law, too. But then, you won't play the bride, you'll play the mother-in-law. I can't act the bad character. I wonder what the story would be if we heard her side of the story. - Would she accept what she has done wrong? - I would say it to her face. You can. But when you put this one-sided story in front of the public... she's going to get self-defensive. - So, it goes like this: The man marries a woman who the mother-in-law doesn't approve. Then it leads to problems. Is that how it goes? Will it be a problem if they understand it's actually you in that scene? No, not at all. I didn't have a baby then. When we would sit around the dinner table... they would say that it doesn't matter if I eat or not. Then even after I had a baby, even a piece of cake was a big deal. It was hard to take. I think this is a good subject for this play. I wonder if my friends were scared of the people's reactions. My mother-in-law should understand, she should listen and see herself. I would accept everything if she would just apologize. - You're not dancing at all. - How can a working man dance? Look, how my husband is working better when I'm singing over here. Some people here make fun of them, "Now village women become artists?" The kids laugh at me, "Your mom is some kind of actress now?" They all say what if your wife goes to Istanbul and doesn't come back... becomes an actress, doesn't want you anymore and finds another man. I say so what. If she finds somebody else there, I'll find someone else here. I always wanted to be a teacher. I used to ask my dad and he said "If you pass your exams, I will send you." I passed all my exams. Then fall came and everyone was enrolling... in secondary school. I asked him again "Are you going to send me to school?" He said, "My girl, you're the teacher of the goats, isn't that enough?" And that's how it's been for 16 years, I'm the teacher of the goats. Until I was 16 years old, I was living in this tent. I didn't have an older brother, I've always been the family shepherd. If a visitor came, I never saw them because I was always after the goats. Now I've sketched out a rough script. If we can fill it up, it'll really be good. It looks good to me but I hope you like it. The stage lights fade in slowly and we start with a harvesting scene. The wife goes home. She has problems at home. Her husband comes home again drunk. - She has one child, the other on the way. - Wow! One in her belly, one on her back! Like they say, keep a baby in her belly and a slap on her back! Then there's a hospital scene. She goes to the village clinic by herself. She gives birth there alone. She leaves home feeling really low. Her husband doesn't realize she's at the hospital and thinks she is missing. Since he has beaten her, he thinks she could have gone to her mother. So he asks for her there. But actually, she has gone to the hospital. - With all of the worries going around in his head... - It finally dawns on him. Then finally he realizes that she may have gone to the hospital... but when he gets to the hospital, she has already given birth. Later, they go home. They try to decide on the baby's name. One says Hatice, another says Ayþe, someone else says Fatma... but instead he suggests a different name, which no-one has ever heard of. This name is the name of his lover while he was in the army. So the girl grows up, goes to school. She's a good student. You know the rest. The girl's brother runs away with someone's daughter... and to make it up to the family... - They give them their daughter. Then the girl runs to her teacher for help. And the story goes on. You say that I'm in this play too, but nothing about me is in this play. - Do you mean your story isn't in the script? - Yes. Well it can't be exact and complete. Everyone knows it's really your life story, even if we change the name. They will criticize me and Mr. Hüseyin, not you. How come you only say that when it comes to my story. I haven't seen myself in it at all. But that's not the point. The point is to present our issues in the villages. But I told you at the beginning. Your stories won't be word for word. I adapt the parts which fit best. If everything was word for word, I would feel uneasy. Since Behiye really wants it, don't feel uneasy, just write it. You know that song by Mahsun Kýrmýzýgül? I've seen many people with no clothes on. I've seen many clothes with no people in. Well it's just like life is. You only have to dress well. Nobody really cares about what's on the inside. But we're going to change some things. It's time to accept each other for who we are, not for how we look. Take me to the coiffeur, spend some money, dress me up like... a sexy model from the city. And stay as you are now. Let's say we go to a restaurant. Who are they going to serve better? You or me? If you go to Istanbul, it's like that. Go to Australia, it's still like that. That's the way it is. I'm waiting for my son to get a bit older. I'll start wearing skirts. They should get used to seeing us in all of these clothes. After that, I'm going to wear pants, if I can lose some weight of course. No, don't. They should accept you the way you are. But Ümmüye, do you know what they say about us? "These are villagers, but can't they buy some proper shoes. - They wear the same shoes all the time." - No, I don't agree with that. You don't have to, but that's what I always hear around me. Because my feelings have changed. I don't care anymore what they say. Since I joined this theater, I really started to feel more confident. Now I walk around totally comfortably in my salwar pants. Take this Zeynep. Put it there. I always say to myself I wish I was born a boy. I really wish I was a man. My father really wished I'd be a boy too, but I wasn't. My mom says the same thing, "You should have been a boy." When I wear a man's costume, I feel just like a man. Let me have a walk downtown like a man. Me too. It's because since I was a kid, I have been doing men's work. I was to herd and to milk all of the animals. I was to collect and carry the firewood. Not just because of the work you do. It's psychological, as a kid... you've been put down because you're a girl. You've been treated like a man and you've been raised like a man. My father used to say, "my girl, you're just like a boy". He sent me to herd the animals and cut the branches up in the trees with boys. That's why I feel like a man. Actually, men's responsibilities are really hard. - Yeah, but only for responsible men. - Exactly. That's why I feel like one minute I'd rather be a man... and the next minute I'd rather not. When I think about the characters, I try to figure out who would play... which character the best. - My voice is too high for a man part. And you probably don't want a woman's role. - No. - She'll become a real man. If I take the role of the drunkard, I'll fit into it perfectly because... I know very well how a drunkard treats his wife. - Don't be too pitiless. - You should be sometimes. - Seyfi will be the man who runs away with Aytül. - I want to do that. Because I know how to run away with a man. And there's the teacher. She's in love with her job. Give it to Ümmüye. But the teacher's role is so small. I have a really good memory. Give me a bigger part. The teacher's role is so small. So, nobody wants to be the teacher? Then, there's Aytül the school girl, the one who was named Aytül... after her father's ex-lover Aytül is the cheerful, giddy one. They needed a young person to play the role of Aytül. They all said, Nesime is the best one for Aytül... so they gave me that role. But because I didn't know what that character had gone through... I said I would take it. But after I read the script, I really didn't want it. It reminded me too much of my past. For example, the way she escapes and runs to the teacher for protection... but I didn't have anyone to help me. And finally, I got the teacher's role. You know the teacher has this serious manner and character. I really liked that. Especially in front of the student's parents. I liked that role much better. It seemed closer to me. I saw that Ümmüye was really enthusiastic about the role of Aytül... and so I didn't want to break her heart either. So we agreed. I'm going to wear a school uniform finally at the age of 47. I don't care what my mother-in-law says. - How are we going to find a uniform that fits you? - I'll buy one. I want this role just because I will finally be a student. What if Naþide acts the student part? Then take me out completely. It's so short anyway. I'm just feeling so happy that at this age, I'm going to finish school. Ok. But, I don't have enough hair to cover the wrinkles. Okay, give me a bob hair cut then. We'll cut bangs too, you'll look just like a student. You're a hairdresser, right? Okay then, one day... The wrinkles shout out I'm 47! Look, we can put cream on your face. No make-up. I'm a student. Students aren't allowed to wear make-up. - Girl, not make-up, just a cream. - My skin is beautiful. If you discover a cream to get rid of the wrinkles then go ahead. Let's just put a little bit of foundation here. For the lights... Good morning teacher. It was a little hard to convince her. She actually really wanted to, but she was feeling insecure. - I was saying I couldn't act. - And the people around her were... saying she couldn't do it, but I convinced her. I think I am good at convincing people. I kept on telling her "You are acting these roles in your daily life anyway." I'm going to train you and you'll do it. And she turned out really well. It would look really good if my hair was cut this short. I should look like a real student. I have to change the skirt though. It makes me look really big. Your mirror is really nice. I really like it. It wasn't easy to take Emine from the hospital. We brought her to the village. 15 years have passed since then. Emine's daughter grew up. Her father insisted that her name should be Aytül. Now, we're back in the village. - Good morning teacher. - Good morning. Thank you. - Please, can you help me! - Why, what happened? They want to marry me off. No way! You were going to finish high school and then go on to university. I want to finish school and maybe I can become a doctor or a teacher. - But my father... I wish I was dead! - Don't worry, my girl. - I will try to convince your father. - My father doesn't listen to anyone. I heard that you are going to take Aytül out of school and marry her off. Not right away. In the summer, after the school year ends. Isn't she going to finish high school and go to university? Say we let her finish high school. Do you think it's easy to send her to college? We can't afford it. - Aytül told me everything. - Don't you get your strange ideas in her head. But she doesn't want to. She's still a child. She should have a better fate than her mother. And so it goes, I also tried to convince them. Such a young girl. Forced to marry such an old man. Without even a wedding. Miss, save me! I ran away! Hey teacher, come outside. You've really gone too far this time. This is like the Middle Ages! Slavery! We are human beings, humans! Aytül managed not to get married. But she couldn't finish school either. You should make your husbands your private hairdressers, like me. Don't get too excited with my hair and turn me into a plucked chicken. There isn't much time for it to grow back. Don't make them laugh at my hair. Well, I'm just cutting. We'll see how it turns out. I'm not a barber. I cut only my wife's hair. It's going to be a man's haircut. Because I am acting a man. If I'm going to act a man, then I should really look like a man. So they shouldn't say, "Look at that man with long hair." Thanks. This is the first time he sees me like this. Your costume looks great. He's scared of his mother. Your mom's become your dad. Seyfi is a good boy. He wants to marry you. Seyfi? Really? Look girl, life's unbearable on your own. What's going to happen... if tomorrow your mother dies? I say you should get married. Fatma, you asked me to cover you for the rehearsal today. I told you okay. Your guests are coming, I understand that. But I told you, don't be too late, come back in mid-afternoon. We don't have much time left. We still couldn't memorize our roles. You said you'd be here. My guests came all the way from a long distance. Should I have come without serving their dinner? You won't die if you cover me for one day. Don't ask me to cover you up because of guests. I don't care if you get mad at me. Only sickness or death can be excused. I haven't missed one rehearsal. I even came when we didn't rehearse my part. You cover those you want to. If you don't cover me, here, take the script. My dear, you don't wanna understand, this play is a matter of life and death. It's next Sunday. If we don't succeed, it won't be my failure, but all of ours. From now on, I'm going to come late everyday. Yes of course! This is very important for us. If you could come, let's just practice our lines at Ümmü's house. I know you're sick. But even in winter, when your back was hurt... you didn't miss a rehearsal. Because theatre is so important for us, isn't it? Will you be able to come then? I was in the army, I fell in love with the commander's daughter. I brought her to the village. They said, but she can't make bread... she can't milk the goats, can't harvest the fields. What can you village women... do besides make bread, milk the goats, harvest the fields? I'm gonna get drunk! Hurry up and finish making that butter, we've got work to do in the other room. What work at this hour? You should say it like this. First say, Emine, my beautiful wife. Then, you're going to say hurry up and finish making that butter. Move in slowly and be tender or she won't do what you want. - Emine, my beautiful wife. - Now a little bit softer. I couldn't memorize this part yet: You should have gotten my permission. Even the mayor has to get my permission when he comes to the village. Hey you guys! Bring your costumes today. MERSÝN HOSPITAL How much does the medicine cost? If you give 20%, then the total is 50. But I only have 5 Lira with me, doctor. Can't you give me something cheaper? You need to take the pills right away and rest. You're ready to give birth. But I still have 3 months left doctor. You shouldn't ask so many questions. Doctor says you're ready to give birth. Isn't there anyone to take care of you? - No, I don't. - Isn't the baby's father here? - No. - Is he dead? - No. - For God's sake! You mean this child is a bastard? Doctor, she can't read or write. She doesn't have any ID with her. How are we supposed to give her a bed? The poor don't have the right to have children? Say it with more anger. THE POOR DON'T HAVE THE RIGHT TO HAVE CHILDREN? My son! My son! It's a boy... I mean, a girl, Mr. Recep. You've beaten Emine. She's got wounds and bruises in her belly. I never beat her. She fell off a donkey. Tell them, Emine. You fell off a donkey. I fell off of a donkey when I was born. Start when the light goes on. Emine's daughter grew up. Her father insisted that her name should be Aytül. Now... we're back in the village. Let's not read it so fast, alright? Nice and slow. You are the narrator. If you miss a part, they won't get the point. Try to get their attention. Make your tone of voice lower and higher, okay? We brought her to the village. A few autumns passed. - Is it wrong? I can just skip that part. - No you can't. It's been 15 years. - A few autumns wouldn't be enough time. - Then I can say "Many autumns passed". Sure, that's what I'm trying to tell you. They're going to forget their lines. Maybe I shouldn't be Aytül, but have Behiye's part instead. It might be better. Why? If I was the narrator, I would do it really well because... I am confident in myself. Don't you agree? Being the narrator is not as easy as you think. - You're probably right. - Being the narrator requires another skill. Why am I getting so nervous in this narration part? You know what you're going to say, but you just can't say it. On stage, you don't have the same chance to make a mistake... as when you're rehearsing. Not at all. Ümmüye can just talk and talk. This narrator part wouldn't be problem for her. But I'm so introverted. Is this why I'm having problems like this? I say to myself, I should speak like that too, but I just can't. Aytül managed not to get married. But she couldn't finish school either. She stayed with her parents. Now Aytül is 25 years old. She has no one but Seyfi. For years, Seyfi's family rejected them. Aytül and Seyfi finally settled in her late father's house. They saved some money so they aren't dependent on anyone anymore. It was really perfect, wasn't it? You studied well. Congratulations, Behiye! Yesterday I was so tense, I'd almost cry. I trust you and your narrating is really good. But I was worried about you confusing your lines. My uncle is always praying "Lord, untie her tongue and let her speak." He should pray for all of us then! Suffering makes you grow up too. We should always take lessons from things. - Didn't you memorize it? - Of course I did, I can recite if you want. Now we come like this. The teacher always says... Now stand up confidently... "Something has to change in this village." I can't do it the way you do. - A confident character stands like this. - It's the problem, I'm not that confident. Don't think so much about the audience. Of course you're comfortable, because you're the principal. You look just like a principal. If God made me a man... I would own these clothes instead of borrowing them. Let's say hello to Mr. Hüseyin. - How do you like my costume? - You look great. I have to work hard on that last bit. Not to be proud but my reading is good. And if I don't get distracted, I catch on really quick. But I couldn't really focus on the script yet. I'd love to empty my mind of everything. I mean, when I'm at the meetings or rehearsals... I can't help it, my mouth is reading but my mind is completely somewhere else. My 13 year old kid says, Mom, you're never home? Is theater more important than us? Well, actually he's right. I have responsibilities. I have to take care of my kids. Make him love the theater and when he loves it as much as you do... he'll hold on to it with enthusiasm. He won't ask you to cook for him anymore, he's going to do it himself. But I'm a mother, I'm a housewife. I can't be away all of the time while the child is waiting. You favor him because he's a boy. That's what you saw your parents do. You're oppressed and can't get rid of it. You do this unconsciously and you don't even realize it. Çaðlar isn't your husband, he's your son. Get rid of that complex. You make me crazy. I'm telling you, don't raise your kid like that. You can't change your husband, but you could still raise your son differently. No matter how much we say men and women are equal. Even if we say we are women and we make theater. We can't get rid of this. We can't. We can't. But since we've started theater, I haven't heard that your husband's beaten you. Your relationship is much better now. But what matters in a family is to keep secrets. I won't say it, even if he beats me. I would never tell. But did something in your marriage change or not? There's a big difference in the way he acts in the house... he treats me much better. You have been oppressed until now. But now you started taking your freedom. You started defending yourself. You found your self-respect. I agree with you. I'm not the one I used to be, I'm telling him. - Many things have changed. - That's what I wanted to hear. - No more being oppressed. - No oppression anymore. Sometimes I may bite my tongue but no more oppression. Emine? Emine! What? Where the hell have you been? Don't worry your pretty little head. The crop won't rot overnight. We can just harvest it tomorrow. If an actress laughs on stage, all is going to be ruined. Emine, girl. You look so cute making that butter. Did you just notice? You make strange body movements while making the butter. It drives me wild. Good God! Did the noonday heat get to you? You dog! Do you think you can just have it whenever you want it? I love you, girl. You made me say it a hundred times. - Swear it, then. Swear to God. - I swear to God I love you. Especially if you had a little baby in your belly. You promised me a better life, liar. Tell the truth, do you really love me? That woman has nobody but you. Doesn't God say that you should help those in need? Instead of pissing around drunk, her husband should be helping. My husband is drinking but he isn't going around with other women. You mind your own business. My husband can drink if he wants. First she's saying bad things about me and then she is praising me. You mind your own business, she says. My husband can drink if he wants. Well, it's just a play. I'd react different if it was real. If I wasn't drinking, it would be hard for me to accept all this. You wouldn't let me act in that play, would you? I'm a loving person. Alcohol comforts me. You know how it is. If it makes you more comfortable, let me drink some too, so I can relax. You give the word, any time you want. But since today you were trying to do such great things... experiencing such beautiful things, it would be nice if my wife would just... touch my hair or something like this. I'm not happy with myself at all about that. But I can't help it. I mean, no lie, sometimes I don't want him to dress nicely. I want him to stay in his shabby clothes. When he shaves and dresses up nicely, I feel like he's slipping out of my hands. But sometimes, I want to just put my arms around his neck... kiss him, say sweet things to him... but somehow, I just can't. My wife wants to show her love actually. She really loves me, but she can't show it. And as much as she loves me, I love her that much too. Let me tell you a story of mine. Years ago, one day... My husband comes home drunk. He brings with him a small bottle of raki. He tells me to set the table. Then he says to bring 2 glasses to the table. What are we going to do with 2 glasses? He says to pour some raki for myself and drink it with one swallow. So, I drank the first shot. Then he fills my glass a second time. He says, drink that one too. So I did. I got totally drunk. Look here, I said to him, why did you buy such a small bottle? You should have gotten the bigger one! Before, I was getting angry even at the small one. I say, you can't go to the coffeehouse. Don't you dare leave that door. I become just like a man when I drink. - Come on girl, lay down a little. - How can I with my pregnant belly? - I'm playing the drunkard husband! - She should catch some tricks from me. I like the scene where I beat up Zeynep the best. We don't do the things in those scenes. But you don't know why I beat her. I only beat her if she deserves it. A word is enough to the wise! He says that drunkard scene is exactly about me. But, then let it be. Come here my goat, come here girl! Then I do like this. And I catch it. I put this here. Stay, good girl. Do it like this Zeynep. I don't want to interfere Mr. Hüseyin, but... Like this, my little goat, come here girl. Then go like this. Show her the food in your hand, pull her over by the ass... hold her like this and sit down. And start to milk her from here. That's enough, OK... In theater, the body language is more important than what you say. Facial expressions, movements and gestures. Here you say "Damn you." Get angry a little bit. You're really annoyed because your husband isn't there. As far as I see, the worst thing you do is you laugh at your own jokes. The audience will laugh, not you. Armed people coming after you. The audience should feel that panic. You've gone too far. I'm going to shoot you both! I wasn't expecting that either, was this a surprise or what? I had a third of a brain left and now that's gone too. You should've fainted over here, not over there. I thought some people came to school to attack us. I thought it was a real gun, that our play was fired at. We were always using a toy gun before. I said, okay girl just throw yourself into that dark corner. This scene was finally realistic enough. Our play will be really good. It's all about ourselves, our life experiences. There's nothing foreign to us in it. It's related to the issues in this place. And people from the other villages can also relate to it. The play-writer is from here, Mr. Hüseyin wrote it. We told him and he wrote it down. Even if I shoot someone with this, it won't do a thing. Why are you buying this? Are you gonna shoot your husband or what? No, I'm gonna shoot the teacher and my daughter. Mersin Arslanköy High School's Village Theater presents: THE OUTCRIES OF WOMEN If the women get outcries, what do the men get? NO POSTING ALLOWED This is the mother-in-law scene. Because I'm not a mother-in-law, I don't know how to treat the bride. I wrote them here, so I don't miss anything. Will a hungry bear dance? Are you gonna make any money out of this? This is the forth finger. And the fifth finger goes... Mr. Hüseyin is here! There will be opening speeches before the play. One of you should say a few words. Don't tell me that it has to be me. You guys can do it too. Now if I say that I'm confident enough, it's already obvious, Mr. Hüseyin. Because I'm half crazy. But what I want is that you get up and talk too. I really want to talk, but because I get over-excited... I won't even try. Okay, I'll give the speech. If there is anyone who disagrees, then say it now. I'll speak. Behiye, do you want to speak too? How about this? You give the first speech as the Director. Then Behiye can say something on why these actresses are doing the play... and you can talk about why you chose to organize such a thing. Okay? So, you're the director and you know everything? Did you direct anyway? Since you think I'm showing off, since I'm not accepted as director... which I've never said in the first place, then find someone who can direct you... without putting pressure on you. You want to direct but you cannot. If you believe that you can, go ahead and do it. But Behiye... I can't make the sacrifices Ümmüye does. Can you? You can't either. - I can't even make all these phone calls. - Then accept it. We all have our own ideas. You should ask everyone's opinions. I am also angry with the others, Zeynep got my point. You say each should express her ideas freely. I don't usually say much. Because whenever I have an idea... as soon as I open my mouth... even before you say "Zeynep is wrong", the others say "Ümmüye is right." This is all she means. Honestly, these problems can be overcome by talking. All artists have these problems. I don't want these people around giving me a headache. I really don't. Don't ever think if you treat me like this that I'll quit, because I won't. I'm in until the end. Look, once you say you're gonna quit, I don't want you anymore. We've come all this way and now you say... "I'm going to kick anyone out" How can you say that? - Everyone is looking at us! - I just started speaking... That's it, I'm leaving. Are we going to be able to make this play? What if they all laugh at us? Are we going to be successful? Will we be punished if we fail? What if they laugh at us? Please pray for us... so people will like it and applaud. That's my only wish, nothing else! Teacher used to say, suffering helps you grow too. We should always learn from our lives. In this village, things have to change. Are you with us? Let's have a school for those who want to learn. Let the theater be our voice! This bride of mine has gone insane. And she's controlling my son's mind. She thinks she's an actress, gets up in front of all the people, like a clown. What kind of woman is this! All Hell will break loose! Girl, can a hungry bear dance? Are you going to earn any money out of it? Yes, we're going to donate it to the school. Who would pay to watch villagers like you wearing salwar pants! Don't say I didn't warn you. You do whatever you want! Thank you. This isn't the marriage scene... I'm running to the teacher. How was it Mr. Hüseyin? The script is ready. We are going to practice at home and the teachers are going to help us. - Girl, are you sure we can make this? - Let's not make everyone laugh at us. Let them laugh. If you believe in yourself, the rest doesn't matter. - Do your husbands allow it? - Yes they do. So what are you worried about? Fuck the rest, what are you afraid of? Stop! I should be notified of this slop you call theater. Theater or meeting, these all are illegal activities. I'll have you arrested. We're not as stupid as you think! We did nothing illegal. If we commit a crime, then you can put us in jail. Right girls? Theater, schmeater, get out of here! Look at yourselves! You're coming to theater dressed like that! What? Do women make theater? If you're a policeman, what business do you have in our theater? So what if I am interfering? God, did something happen to her? You all saw it right? You saw I didn't hit her, right? This poor woman has really a bad fate. Just like her mother. Her first beating came from her father while she was in her mother's womb... and her last, the police officer. What's happened now, what's changed? Aytül has the same fate with her mother. I guess that's where our theater ends. Aytül, so you thought you could change destiny? This theater will never end. We suffered it. Our children won't. We will work, we will succeed. We are human beings, humans!
