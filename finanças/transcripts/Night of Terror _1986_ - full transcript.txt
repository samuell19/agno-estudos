(grim piano music) - Hi Madison, you mean so very much to me. I love you very much. - Alex, if you love me, why won't you marry me? - You know I can't divorce Chris. There's too much at stake. Believe me. - Do you really wannna divorce Chris? - Of course. - Alex, if you really wanted to, I know you'd find a way. There's some things that I know about you, Alex. And I'm sure if she knew it would make things a lot easier for you. - You worry too much. Everything's gonna be alright eventually. - Hi Madison, look at me. Look at me. - Alex! Alex what are you doing? Alex, Alex, what are you doing? Alex! Alex, why? Why Alex, why? (symphony music) (eerie music) - Judgement Day, time to pay your dues. (gun fires) - Now Tom! - No. Anne will be here any minute. (gun fires) - This'll only take a second Tom. (screaming) - [Anne] I'm home. Tom? (screaming) No! - Paul? Answer me. I'm here. With you. Your mother. Don't you recognize me? (mumbling) - They put it on me. I don't wanna do it. - Do what? - Oh god. I'm gonna kill you. You bastard. You bastard, I hate you! I hate you, I hate you, I hate you. I hate you. I hate you, I hate you, I hate you. I hate. - [Patient] You can't do that you stupid idiot, you cheated again. - I did not. - You shouldn't of gone to Las Vegas, Bob. And lost all that money. I told you over and over again you son of a bitch. - You are my attorney. You better get me out of here. What am I paying you for? - Doctor Harper told me you've improved a great deal but you're not cured yet. Releasing the patient now would severely damage her mental health. - Listen, Joe, please. I should not be here. I am alright. I am as sane as you are, there is nothing, nothing wrong with me. - Not according to Doctor Harper and your husband. - Don't tell me. Seymour has gotten ahold of Alex like this, like, like this. - [Patient] Look at my baby, look, look. - And the way he's sweeping money out of him for so called research. - Bad baby. I'm going to kill you. - Inez, if she just hadn't threatened to tell Chris about our affair. - That's right Alex. If you hadn't screwed her, maybe she wouldn't of tried to screw you. - Doctor Harper? What have you done to my son? He's not getting any better. He's getting worse. And I don't see any improvement. - We're doing our very best to help your son. - I think you're a killer. - [Seymour] Ma'am get ahold of yourself. - You told me that you could improve on his mental retardation. But he's gotten even worse. - Orderly, Nurse, please get this woman out of here. - You killed his mind, he's worse now then when he first entered the hospital. I can't believe I gave my written consent. - We haven't even scratched the surface of our research yet. We were just coming up with more questions. No answers. Nothing. - Have you spoken to Alex? - Not yet, I've tried to contact him but he's rather elusive. - I know. His research is all the man cares about. - Yes, I've spoken to Doctor Harper about it. You know perfecting the brain surgery in order to at least give some intelligence to the retard is quite an exciting undertaking. - Ouchopia. Pure science fiction if you ask me. And he tries to stand by so powerless while Alex raised his life and a hopeless dream. - Landing a man on the moon was once considered a hopeless dream. No, I think Doctor Harper and your husband have something very exciting going. And it could make them very famous. - And would dry my finances. - Only indirectly, Chris. After all, Michelin Mills is responsible for their research. - Uh-Uh, Joe, let me explain, please. My board of directors is getting value and ease about this particular tax shelter. And they are considering the possibility of withdrawing their support. Alex of course is very upset about the whole thing. - Oh really? Well Alex told me that you were upset about it. And had accused him of trying to force you to a sale of the Mills. He sited your rather eccentric behavior as another one of your hallucinations. - [Chris] Can't believe it. - Alex? We can't keep Chris here any longer. Her attorney is making some inquisitive noises. - Did you tell him she's still under severe stress? Has those hallucinations? And about her erratic behavior? - Obviously. But he threatens to have her examined by a psychiatrist of his choice. - And he'll find out there's nothing wrong with her. - Yeah. Too bad. Life would be a lot easier if we weren't so desperate for Chris's money to finance our research. - Just remember, money's the root of all research. (grim music) - Here's some piece and quiet. Something going on here. Something bad. - What's going on, Johnny? - They killed someone here. A girl. There was this girl and they put a long needle in her head. - Who Johnny? Who? Tell me. - Nurse Flannigan and Doctor Harper. - Oh my god. - If they find out I saw them kill her, a girl, they'll kill me. - No, nothing will happen to you, nothing. - Let's go, let's go, time to go. - I don't want to, I won't go. No, no. - We're going to the treatment room now, we're going to the treatment room. Now come on let's go. - No. Let me go - Go. - We're going. - Go, no, no! - No Anne! No! (grim music) - All we have to do is perform a relatively simple operation on Chris. We'll inactivate these areas surgically. And your wife's mental capacities will deteriorate very quickly. You'll have her declared incompetent. And her money is yours. - Sounds simple enough. - Not quite. There are a few things we have to do before we can perform the surgery. First, we'll have to release her. - Release her? - And inform her attorney that she's cured. Then we'll have to get her into a stressful situation. Well nevermind, I'll think of something. Anyhow, once the poor girl begins hallucinating again, we'll have no other choice. We'll have to bring her in for treatment. Then we'll perform the surgery. And bingo. - Doctor Harper. Doctor Harper. - What's wrong? - Patient number 56 has escaped. - Paul Pierson? - That's impossible. He has no will of his own. - Well he's not there. - You know, you're homely. No wonder no one ever loved you. Oh. They tolerate you because you own the Michelin Mills. Pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty! Oh my god. What am I doing? I'm acting like the rest of them. What are they doing to me? Alex. Why did they put me like this? (knocking on door) - Chris. I have good news for you. - I can go home? - Well not exactly home, darling. Chris? You're not completely recovered yet. You'll have to remain for some time under Seymour's care. - Forget about Seymour. I can't stand him. - He's familiar with your case. Your stress symptoms, your hallucinations. - Oh come on Alex, I never had hallucinations. And I don't trust Seymour, there's, there's something about him. (grim music) - Doctor Harper! - Alex? What is happening between us? Is there another woman? - What gave you that idea? - You're so distant. Let's be honest, you inject me, why? - You're imagining things. What you're still doing is living in your imaginary world of fears. You're not cured yet. (knocking on door) - Alex, I need to see you for a moment. It's urgent. - Excuse me. - Mom! - Becky. - Dad told me you've been released. - Let me take a look at you, you look good. - Let's get out of here. - We are free. Free. - Free, alright. - Yay, free. - Chris, I'm so glad Dad married you instead of-- - Instead of whom? - Nevermind. (eerie music) All we have to find out now is. Grain Hilles, Inez's house. - Inez? - Why? Do you know her? - No. Not really. - May I help you? - Yes. Please. - That will be a dollar. - We're looking for Inez's place. - You'll be spending the summer there. - How do you know? - I know things and I feel things. - Are you psychic? - Some people think I am. Inez's house is about two miles down the road. You really can't miss it. - Thanks. - You know, if I were you, I would turn right around and go back to Los Angeles. - Why? - Well it's, really not my place to say. Paul. What are you doing here? - Hi, Mom. I'm home. I've run away. - I'm working my fingers to the bone to get you well. And you've run away. You're going straight back to the hospital. - I can't go back. I've, disorderly. He was a bastard. He deserved. I didn't wanna do it. I had to. - Oh my god. What have they done to you? - [Paul] Mom? I wanna stay with you - Let me think. - [Paul] And you'll fix me up a fritters? - [Celeste] This is the first place they'll come looking for you. - You're not mad with me are you Mom? You're not going to stick a needle in my head. - I love you. You're my son. I love you so much it hurts. No. I'm not angry with you. I know. You'll hide out at the old McFarlin place. - No, Mom, that place is haunted. - Well you're gonna have to go there right now. - Becky. Did you peel a few minutes ago? - No. But let me show you something. - You got yourself a snapshot of a ghost. - You're kidding, you mean that's a shot of an apparition? - Possibly. - Come on, Mom, be sensible. There's no such thing as ghosts. (TV static) - Really? (eerie music) (ruffling) Who's there? (screaming) (evil laughing) - Listen to me Kirk. Can you feel what's happening? It's all over. Feel your forehead curve. That's right. It's hot in here. Your usefulness is over. Immortals live in the cool of the clouds. But you are burning. Because you are in hell. - Mom, I'm going to the village, do you need anything? - Can't think of anything. - Okay. - Have fun. - Bye. - Bye-Bye. (ruffling) (eerie music) (gasping) (glass shattering) Who is it? Go away. Don't bother me. Please go away. Can't you hear? I said don't bother me. - [Ellen] Hey, take it easy. I'm Ellen Harper. Doctor Harper's wife. - [Chris] Please come on in. - I'm your next door neighbor. That is, if living two miles down the road you can call next door. - Is there anything I can get you, some coffee, tea, a cold drink? - Coffee's fine. - [Chris] Can't find a thing. I have coffee cups, a spoon. Coffee. - Messy, messy, messy. - [Chris] I just moved yesterday and I didn't have any time to clean up or to unpack or just to do anything. - Thanks. - Don't apologize. I like messy. - You do? - It gives this law bug me a good feeling. I mean, your kitchen doesn't come up to mind. I still take the prize for messiness. - I never imagined Doctor Harper married to-- - To a slob? - Oh no, no. Well yeah. - Well. I guess everyone expected the Great Seymour with fancy dedicated germ hunter. You know, scrub, scrub, clean, clean, wash, wash. Someone like our sainted Inez. - Oh you know her? - Who didn't? Oh yes I knew her. - You said you knew her? - I mean I know her. What in the world possessed you to rent her house? - [Chris] I didn't. Your husband rented it for me. - I see. - Is there anything wrong with this house? - Well. Nothing wrong except a leaking roof, a warm water heater that doesn't like warm water. You know, the ordinary little disasters. - Nothing like that. I mean, is this house haunted? - [Ellen] For heavens sakes. - But I hear footsteps and I hear voices and someone crying. - Hey. Don't let my Seymour hear you say that crap. You know he doesn't believe in ghosts and all that shit. He'll have you back in the loony bin in no time. - So. Seymour doesn't believe in spirits. - Only in the bottled kind. - That's it, huh? - Which brings me to my errand, we're having a little party tonight and I'd love for you to come over and meet everybody and see what's going on. - Would love to. I'll enjoy putting on my best dress. (water surging) - I thought about going down to my dad's party, he's got a live band. - Probably moldy oldies I bet. Yeah. I wanna do something exciting. - I know what. We can go to the old McFarlin place and try to get in. - The haunted house? Are you bonkers? - It might be kinda fun. It's spooky. - Hey it's only an old farm house. Chicken. (upbeat instrumental music) - Hi. Good, good. What can I fix you folks? ♫ I tried so hard to be your friend ♫ How could you ever let it end? ♫ Well it seems to me ♫ You're just a gal ♫ Why do we close the door on love ♫ And let it go? - Chris, I want you to meet Doctor Levin and his daughter Alice. This is Chris Nilsen. - How do you do? How do you do? - Hi. - So you're Alex's wife? - Yes I am. - Oh it's so nice to meet you. Your name is Chris? - Yes. - I always thought Alex was a bachelor. Daddy, didn't Inez tell us-- - Nevermind, nevermind. - Marge, hi. - Hi, Alice, how have you been? - Great, how was Europe? - Oh smashing, let me tell you. ♫ I have it all ♫ I'll never give my youth and all I know ♫ Why do we close the door on love ♫ And let it go? ♫ Love is the only thing we will ever know ♫ Love is the only thing that we will ever know - Well, well, how is my favorite patient tonight? I hope you like the house I rented for you. What can I fix you? - Some punch please. The house is fine. And I've arrived. - Glad to hear it. Still, I think it might be a good idea if you had someone with you at the house. Why hello Mrs. Peterson. What a surprise to see you. After all I don't think I invited you. - I want to talk to you, Doctor Harper. - Not now. - [Celeste] Right now about my son, Paul. - Call me in the morning. Yes in fact take two Aspirin and call me tomorrow. - You're a fraud. A killer. - Would you leave my house? Now. - I will see you. We met the other day at your store, remember? - Oh yes. I remember, I gave you directions to Inez's house. - Right. - I know I wasn't very friendly to you then. Why didn't you go back to Los Angeles? - Well. - Don't you know that you're in great danger? Chris, don't stay in Inez's house. Please. I'm going! ♫ Why don't you know right back on your words ♫ I tried so hard to be your friend ♫ How could you ever let it end? ♫ Well it seems to be we're just begin - Funny. But I pictured you different. - Really? - Kind of cold, stirring. I mean business like. Completely different from Inez. - [Chris] Inez? - Nevermind. I must've had a drop too many. What made you marry Alex? The two of you are so different. - Well, let's see. Desperation I guess. I was so busy running the mills, so time kind of slipped by. So one day when I looked into the mirror and saw this girl I pictured myself to be just disappeared. Ah what the hell. No one ever asked me. So when Alex came along I just kind of grabbed him. Come on, Ellen. I'm not a computer. I want the warmth and companionship. Understanding. Or at least the illusion of it. (upbeat instrumental music) ♫ Say that you love me ♫ Tell me your size ♫ Show me you want me ♫ You want me tonight ♫ 'Cause I got to know ♫ Know and fear ♫ Don't just turn my notes just on just to ♫ watch me spin my wheels ♫ Tell me or something ♫ I want your touch ♫ Please step to the fire ♫ I want you so much ♫ Send me a signal ♫ I don't care how ♫ I'm smoked to my wire ♫ Its good to be loved ♫ 'Cause I can't hold back ♫ I know you're the world ♫ And I ain't nobody called love ♫ And I won't take a cooler ♫ Tell me or something ♫ Head to the touch ♫ Please step to the fire ♫ I want you so much ♫ Say that you love me ♫ Tell me it's nice ♫ Show me you want me ♫ You want me tonight ♫ My temperatures rising ♫ That's a good sign ♫ But don't be forever ♫ We're running out of time ♫ Tell me or something - Having a good time? - Yes, it's a really, really nice party. Everyone seems to be having such a good time. - What were you talking to Chris about? - Nothing important. Just party chitchat. - Anything you say to that psychotic is important. I don't want you talking to her about the McFarlin house. Or anything else, period. My research is at a critical stage. I will not tolerate anyone or anything jeopardizing my work. And that includes you. It would be wise to be very clear about that. - I don't like the tone of that. - You'd like the reality of it even less. - [Bill] Seymour, I'm concerned about the lack of success we've had with our experiments. - I'm all to any brilliant suggestions you might have, Bill. - [Bill] Why not abandon the project? It's not brilliant but it's logical. - We are all passed the point of no return, Bill. It shouldn't surprise you the problems do occur when you're on the cutting edge of medical research. But if it'll make you feel any better, Alex is recruiting some nice volunteer, anonymous street people. (somber music) - [Woman] Let's go. - [Woman] Now that the bands gone, what are we gonna do? - How bout' a movie? - Nah, it's too late. - Oh come on. - How bout' a pizza party? - Yeah, yeah. - Too fattening. - Oh that's right, you better watch out, huh? - How bout' if we go to the old McFarlin place? - [Woman] No way, that place is too spooky. - [Man] So what, party pooper. - I just don't like this kind of fun. - Yeah when the ghosts go boo. - Shut up. - So bad. - So it's all settled, we're going into the car. - No, wait, count me out, that is trespassing. Give me a break. - Yeah let's go before it's too late. - Alright, hey guys don't squeal that to anybody, my dad will give me help if he found out we were going to his little special place, alright? - Yeah, hell he doesn't know I've seen things now. - What things? - Never you mind, you'll find out for yourself. (upbeat instrumental music) - [Girl] Hi there, handsome. - [Alex] Hi beautiful. - Wanna have a good time? - [Alex] What's a good time? - Anything you want. 50. And don't mess up my hair. - [Alex] 50's fine. How's that? - Sure. But not 'till you show me the dough. Okie dokie. My place is just around the corner. - You guys, I'm scared, let's go home. - Don't be a chicken. - Excuse me, girls. You wanna like, let's get going? - Take a left at the next block. Hey mister. Where do you think you're going? I told you to make a left. - I heard. - What do you think you're doing? Oh shit. Let go of me. No! - That's a weird place, I'm telling you. - Scaredy cat. - It's an old empty house, there's nothing to be scared about. - Yeah I've been in this dump a couple times. The right girl and I mean it's not so bad at all. - [Man] Will you shut your mouth? - All you ever think about is sex. - [Becky] Did you see that? - [Girl] What? - The man in the second story window. - A ghost? - Becky? - [Becky] Just a minute. - You better get your ass in here, on the double. - Mom, what are you doing? - [Chris] Look. The chair. It rocks all by itself. - No it doesn't. - What are you talking about? - Maybe I should be back in the loony bin. (water trickling) - What's wrong? - [Chris] Wrong? Nothing's wrong. Just listen. Listen to this noise. There's no one in the kitchen. - What noise? I don't hear anything. - Oh my god. - Maybe you should see Seymour and talk to him. - [Chris] No, I hate him. - Talk to him, you're hallucinating again. - Becky. I never had hallucinations and I don't have hallucinations now. I know what I see and I know what I hear. - [Becky] But dad said. - Nevermind. Doctor Harper please. - Come on Becky, the water's great, let's get in. Come on. (shouting) (laughing) - I hear someone's, I mean, footsteps. The swishing of silk. - Silk? - [Chris] Yes. Like, an evening gown or a robe. I guess a robe. - Anything else? - Look. When I first came to the house, I had right away this, yeah, this oppressive feeling. - Could you be more specific? - No. I don't know. - Was there anything else? - I don't wanna talk about it. - Chris. We're not getting anywhere this way. I know you're not overly fond of me. - I despise you. And I hate what you stand for. - That's pretty strong, Chris. I think it's simple a case of you're being jealous of my work. - [Chris] Not at all. But I'm afraid of the influence you have over Alex. - Still, you're financing our research. - Not for long anymore. Seymour, you know as well as I do that my board of directors is opposed to this particular tax shelter. - Well let's not worry about the board. Let's get on with our session. I have another patient scheduled. So how bout' this feeling you've encountered. - I don't know. It is like something is coming towards me. Out of the walls. The furniture. And this morning, and this is why I called you, I saw a rocking chair rocking all by itself. And there were all kinds of noises from the kitchen like an egg beater going. Coffee peculating, bacon sizzling. Seymour, I don't wanna talk about it. I think you better risk it. - Alright. (upbeat instrumental music) (laughing) - Alex. Hi. How are things goin'? Can't complain. Everything's moving along on schedule. Yeah. Chris is right on the path we wanted her to travel. Yeah, she's hearing all the sounds you planted in the house. Here listen. (water trickling) Terrific work. Yeah. She even mentioned some sounds I didn't know anything about. - What other noises? I don't know what you're talking about. - All kinds of kitchen noises. An egg beater going 100 miles an hour. Bacon sizzling. Oh let me ask you. How did you manage to rig up the rocking chair so it rocks all by itself? - Rocking chair that rocks by itself? I didn't rig up anything like that. What the hell's going on there, anyway? - I see the phenomena and I hear those eerie sounds. But Becky, that's my step daughter doesn't. Am I hallucinating? Am I insane? You tell me. You are the psychic. - You are not hallucinating at all. You really did encounter the supernatural. - But, why me? Why didn't Becky too? - Some people encounter the supernatural and others don't. You must understand the human mind as far as the supernatural is concerned. It works like a radio receiver. Some radios can pick up signals from over seas. Others pick up signals that are transmitted from a radius of several miles away only. You're tuned in to pick up supernatural signals. It's as simple as that. You're not crazy at all. Don't worry. - Inez. Inez, wait for me. Wait for me. (rattling) There are no sounds. Seymour is right. There are no sounds. Chris. Get ahold of yourself. (laughing) That's ridiculous. The chair doesn't rock. No. Dear lord, please. I'm not insane. (thrilling music) - Chris? Chris wake up. You were out cold when I came in, what happened? - I don't know. There was this man. - Are you hurt? - Not really. - Well you better come home with me for a little while. You shouldn't be doing that, you should be resting. - I'm fine. El Bordess. Beckman. Controut. Wrong file. By the way, I saw Inez this morning. - You couldn't, she's gone. I mean she went to Europe. - Probably I was wrong. - I'm quite sure you were. - Have you heard from her? - No I haven't. - Not even a postcard? - Not even a postcard. - She's probably having so much fun she's forgotten her friends. - Probably. - Not even Alice Lovins heard from her. And you know Alice the blabber mouth would've told me. - Alice? The blabber mouth? - Oh yeah, she's our local gossip. Chris. If I were you, I wouldn't ask too much about Inez. - [Chris] Why? - I can't tell you. But I'm your friend. - [Chris] I know you are. - And I wouldn't want you to get hurt. - Is this a warning? Alright. I'll stand warned. - It's so damn hot today. (phone ringing) Hello? Well. I don't know. I'll call you right back. One of Seymour's patients. Professional code of ethics. - Go ahead. - I'll be right back. - A passport. Inez passport. Her credit cards. How can she be in Europe without her passport? (upbeat pop music) - [Instructor] Bend the knee, bring it up. Five more. Four. Three. Two. Okay, don't turn off here and lift. Three. Four. Five. Six. And back. Up two. Three. Four. Spread those legs, let's go. - I envy Inez. Being in Europe at this time of the year. - I don't think Inez has much fun. - Really? - These exercises are gonna kill me. I don't think she really wanted to go to Europe. She left in an awful hurry. It was about five maybe six weeks ago when Inez came by. She looked god awful. You know, really drawn. That girl was a mess. One of these days they're gonna have to take me out of here on a stretcher. This thing is a killer. Anyway. Inez told me she was afraid. - Of what? - I don't know. She only told me she was afraid. She said, I'm afraid that something will happen to me. - [Instructor] And we're finally down to four, three, two and switch. Four, three, two, one, other side. And four, three, two. - It doesn't make any sense. How could Inez be in Europe without her passport? - No it doesn't make any sense. Unless. - She was killed before she even needed her passport. - Did you go to the police? - Are you kidding? They know I was in the loony bin, they wouldn't believe a word I'm saying. - Well that's true. So for starters. Let's find out what really happened to Inez. I always find a Ouija board handy for an initial investigation. So how about it? - [Chris] Becky, you better take a sweater along. - Don't treat me like a five year old. - Sorry. So, where are you off to? - Well we're going out for pizza and then maybe to the McFarlin place. - Becky, why didn't you ever tell me that your father was having an affair with Inez? So he was. - I think this house is in a period of activity. I believe we have a good chance of making contact with any entity occupying this house. We must give our full concentration and belief. We are ready. We have cleansed ourself of disbelief. We can accept any entity coming towards us. (eerie music) - I don't like this place. - Gives me the creeps. - Just look at this place. - I'm going home. - You scaredy cat, come on. - I'm definitely going home. - Don't wet your pants. - [Becky] Did you see that thing in the window? - Maybe we should go home. - Let's find out who that guy is. Hey mister! Well? - Maybe he's dead. - Let's go inside and take a look. - But be careful. - Oh my dad will kill me if he ever finds out I snooped around this place. - What are we waiting for? - What does it say? Does it mean innocence? - Wait. Trying to get in touch with the spirit guide. Tell us your name. Say it. Q. V. R. U. No. Julia. No. Julian. Man by the name of Julian will be our spirit guide. He will answer our questions. We want to make contact with a woman named, Inez. Is she still with us? - No. - Has she crossed over to the other side? Has she crossed over? - No. - Is she in limbo? - Yes. - We now know what happened to Inez. She was killed. (knocking on door) - Where are the kids? - Becky said they went to some place. Yes. The McFarlin place. - The McFarlin place? Oh my god. When did they leave? - [Chris] About an hour or so ago. - We better get their before. - Before what? - [Ellen] Nevermind. - I think we better go right now. (creaking) - I think I'm going home. - It's spooky. - Come on, let's check this out. (creaking) - What is it? - What is that? - I don't know. - Let's get out of here. - Oh you can, yeah. - In here. - Let's check it out. (eerie music) It's gotta be in here. Oh my god. You alright? Looks familiar, yeah? (wood shattering) Oh man let's get out of here. - No, I wanna found out what that noise is. (glass shattering) Look. It's an old radio. - We thought we were ghost busting. We don't tell the guys about this huh? Hey let's get out of here. There's an old radio on. There's gotta be someone living her right? I don't wanna meet that guy. Let's get out, come on. - Which way did we come in? - I'm not sure. I think here. - No, no, we came up some steps. - I don't remember any steps. Joe! Becky? - Vicky! Tony! Come out you idiots. - I bet you they left us stranded. - Yeah I bet they're laughing their foreheads off. - Wait 'till I get ahold of those jerks. Let's try this way, eventually we'll get out. - Let's go. Come on. I told you before. - Come on Becky, you know you want it as much as I do. - I said no. And I mean no. - You're a dirty tease. - I'll get you for this. - [Chris] So what happened to Inez, tell me. - [Ellen] How should I know? - [Chris] I bet she never went to Europe. - [Ellen] Don't talk so much, let's hurry. Alright, alright so she didn't go to Europe. - [Chris] So what happened to her? - [Ellen] I'll tell you later. (grim music) - Joe! Becky! Don't play games! Come on right now! - I never realized. Now I know. Inez. - Paul! - Paul? - We better look for the kids. - Why don't you two look downstairs and I'll go upstairs. - Okay. - White mill house. (gasping) Inez. What do you want from me? What do you want? Do you want me to find out what happened to you? Do you warn me that the same thing might be happening to me? Ellen. Celeste, let's get out of here. Celeste? Ellen? I'm leaving. There must be another way out of this place. (gasping) Oh no. Oh my god. That's not funny. Becky, don't play games. Joe, where are you? Oh my god. - Chris. You never stop worrying me, darling. Did you have another one of your hallucinations? - People don't realize how dangerous these dilapidated old houses can be. Loose floor boards. Wriggly staircases. Anything could happen to you here. - But now I'm here to take care of you. Take care of you. Take care of you. - Now let me tell you. Not one word about anything you saw or heard last night. To anyone. - Yeah, okay. - We promise. - Yes Doctor Harper. - Or you'll be sorry. All of you. - Alright kids, come on, let's go. - Listen, Doctor Nilsen. Give me Nurse Flannigan please. Nurse? This is Doctor Nilsen. Yes we did find Paul. - Where did I leave my other purse? - Doctor Harper will be taking Paul back. Yeah make sure that Paul is under heavy sedation. Don't we need him? You know. We'll up Pierce for a routine lobotomy. Then like we did with Inez, our greatest patient Paul will rush in and take care of the problem. Nurse, you know what I mean. Do I have to spell it out for you? Kill Chris. Don't worry, it worked with Inez it'll work with Chris. Don't worry about that little hooker. I took care of her when our brilliant Seymour batched up her lobotomy. Okay, see you later. Get me nurse Flannigan again on the double. Nurse. I almost forgot to tell you. We do need to have surgery set up as usual. It's important we make it seem like another routine lobotomy. Nothing out of the ordinary. (upbeat instrumental music) Take care. (engine stuttering) - Come on. Punts! - Chris wait a minute, stop! (tires screeching) (engine racing) (engine turning over) - Celeste, you gotta help me! - Oh I'm sorry Chris I'm really sorry. But I've got to protect Paul. Doctor Nilsen said he would turn Paul over to the police. If I didn't cooperate. - My poor darling. Why your hallucinations. Your trip into madness. (thunder crackling) - I hate these storms. It's very difficult to function before any kind of surgery during an electrical storm. - Oh it'll be over soon. - I hope so. Is Paul ready? - He is. (thunder crackling) (thrilling music) - Did I. (screaming) - [Chris] No, Becky. Paul did not kill your dad. He, Seymour and Nurse Flannigan died of fear. At least, that's what the coroner's report stated. Fact is, Paul did not kill anyone. - [Becky] I know, he was under hypnotic suggestion when he killed Inez and the young prostitute. Seeing the black hood was kind of a signal he followed. - [Chris] I talked with Celeste. And she said since he's now under sensible psychiatric care he might be cured. - [Becky] It's simply impossible for me to accept the reality of what father and Seymour did. - [Chris] Well their researched out of a viable base or what they really wanted was to help the criminally insane. - And later when they had a chance to make it big things got out of hand and in the course of their experiments they killed some people. - And then the money ran out. - Mom, believe me, I didn't know what dad was up to and that he wanted your money. If I had known I would've warned you. - I know. So, why don't you forget about the past and start living for the present? - [Becky] You're right, Mom. - Just look at God's creation around you. Asking us to live fully each day he gives us. (eerie music)
