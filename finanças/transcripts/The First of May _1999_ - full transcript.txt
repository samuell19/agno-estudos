Well uh, this just says that you received the child and everything is in order. If you would just sign here please. So Cory I will be seeing you on Saturday. We have a group called Foster Friends, and we do all kinds of exciting things. We sing at hospitals and nursing homes. We go roller skating. Now doesn■t that sound like fun? It'd be fun to see you fall and watch you try to get up. Tudaloo everybody. Well um, the cars over this way. So... Got a surprise for you. These are for you. Thanks. I'll save the bag for the next kid. That will teach you to defy me! Why can't I destroy you? I am a Titan! I am invincible! Your weapons can not harm me. Nothing can hurt me! Cory, for the seventh time this month your teacher called. She's concerned about your grades. Cory! I know it's only been 4 weeks, but I thought maybe we could spend some time on your math today. But its Saturday! Perfect day to get in some batting practice. Honey its kind of rainy. It will stop. How bout we play some and work some when Miss Hanks brings you back. I don't wanna go with Miss Hanks and her fractured friends. Foster Friends Cory. Do I have to? [car horn] Yes you do, there she is. Oh Michelles so nice, why don't you wave to her. Well your very lucky to be with the Keppermans. Why at their age and no children of their own, they might just be thinking of adoption! WOO! Wouldn't that be wonderful?! That■s it right up the stairs. Cmon, cmon. Ok now hold on. Now don't be nervous, and smile. And don't you ruin it. Go on in now everyone knows were coming, and the patients are very excited. Welcome Miss Hanks, welcome children. Edgewaters, these are the foster children who will be entertaining us today. Thank you Miss Cybil. The children have two songs they'd like to sing for you today. The first number is that inspiring piece from the civil war era, "The battle hymn of the republic". "Mine eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the lord, He is trampling out the vintage where the grapes of wrath are stored, He hath loosed his fateful lightning of his terrible swift sword, His truth is marching on. Glory! Glory! Hallelujah! Glory! Glory! Hallelujah. Glory! Glory! Hallelujah! His truth is marching on! [canon explodes] ■ Music ■ Yes! Woo! ■ Music ■ You better stand up straight and sing, and I mean it. Wasn't that lovely Blaine? Elcie? We have some refreshments. Perhaps the children would like to serve them. Oh, I■m sure they would. I■m sure they wouldn't [snoring] [sigh] I saw you turn down her oxygen! You have now turned all of us into zombies. Carlotta, now behave. Have something to drink I do not want any of that! It tastes like dishwater, ugh! Now you call that entertainment? In our show we had children younger than you, Juggling on the high wire. Do not quit your day job first of May. Oh, Cybil who do you have for us in act 2? Dr. Kevorkian? If you cant fit in peacefully, you'll have to leave. What? And miss the moldy macaroons and the Macarena lesson? Oh how could I possibly live without that? I watched you. You did not sing. So? But I understand. I do not like to sing in this place either oh, ohhhh. Were off! Make sure she has her medication. Oh, be gone before someone drops a house on you! [car horn] Hey Cory [phone rings] Oh, Ill get it. What'd I tell you, is this baseball weather or what. Oh hey. Why do you always wear that raggedy old hat? Well sit down, This isn't just any old hat Cory. This is an official New York Yankees baseball hat. My dad got this for me at Yankee Stadium a long time ago. Yankee Stadium, the house that Ruth built. One of the greatest dynasties in sports history. Well, whats a dynasty? A dynasty is when you have a really great team that just keeps winning, and they pass it on year after year some teams can keep it up for a couple or three years, but the Yankees did it for 30 years in a row started out with Babe Ruth, the Bambino. the Sultan of Swat then it went on to Lou Gherig, the iron horse and then, the greatest all around baseball player of all time. The Yankee clipper, Joe Dimmagio. Could do everything Cory. He could hit for power, hit for average, run, field, throw. My dad said that he saw him play once Danny, its for you. Be right back. How was your singing debut? Sucked eggs. Did you make any new friends? Nope, all geeks and zombies I picked up some flashcards, I thought we could work on math facts together. Why don't you just poison me? Its more humane. Could be fun? Us foster kids may be a little dumb, but we know whats a good time and whats not I understand Cory. No you don't. Yes, I do. There■s something that people don't know about me... One of the supervisors called in sick and I gotta go to work. No! I■m sorry I tried. They're heartless. Maybe we can do this next Saturday huh? Doesn■t matter Cory i'm really sorry. Its ok. ■ Music ■ Hello? Anybody home? Cool. Hey you boy! What is that you have? A turtle. Bring it here! Come! I will not bite! You are the boy who came not to sing this morning. Yea. What does it do? Nothing but hide? So? Hes invincible. He does not seem like much of a pet I had an elephant. One step and you would be flat like a pizza. An elephant, sure lady. No, no, no it did not belong to me. It belonged to the circus but I was there when she was born and I got to name her. Yea I called her Annabelle. I joined the circus when I was 16. Started out selling cotton candy. Then I became the magician's assistant and later I was madame sargosa, fortune teller. Sees all, knows all. And after that the circus changed. What is your name young man? Don't you know? Some fortune teller! I know you have a smart mouth, but not much else is smart! Tell me your name Cory Wainwright. So, what's my fortune? Well, there may be things in your future you do not want to know. Look Cory Wainwright, your turtle is running away. It wants to be free it does not want to be your pet. Everything wants to be free. You, me, even that old turtle. Well did you let your elephant go? Carlotta? Is that your name, carlotta? Yes. Whats your last name? Just carlotta. Why carlotta dear, what on earth you are going to catch your death. Weren't you one of Mrs hanks children? Yea. What is that thing? Its a turtle. Well get it out of here it can carry all kinds of diseases. You oughtta go on home now. This is a quiet place. A place for the elderly. Go on now. Ill show you something tomorrow. Did you know that the sea turtle can swim 20mph and a smooth soft-shell turtle can out run a man on solid ground. Wow! See what a library card and a little digging turns up. Yea but he doesn't look like he can out run anything. Well he's a box turtle. He's built for comfort not speed I guess. So what does he eat? Um, just about anything it says. They especially like fruits I learned the hard way that they like vegetables. One used to sneak into my garden and take a bite out of. My best vegetable before it was perfect and ripe. Dan wanted to get rid of it but I thought it was cute. But not as cute as you I got to find a place where I can keep him. Here, this might work for tonight. There you go. Yea this will be a good home, for... What are you gonna call him? Well um, how about Mr. T? Lets see if Mr. T. likes this. Here it goes again. There you go, open up. Huh? How come he wont eat? I don't know. Do you think he's lonely? Maybe he is. Well tomorrow ill go find him a Mrs T. What if he is a Mrs t? What page is that on? Hey guys, whats for supper? Oh turtle soup huh mmm [baseball chatter] Strike 2! Your the new foster kid in ms. Fukes class aren't you? Yea I hear your going to flunk. Strike 3! He's dead meat, he's toast, stick a fork in him, he's done! Rained out huh? Worse, struck out. Mind if I sit down? Sure I want you to know that hitting a baseball is a very difficult thing to do. What do you know about baseball? A little I had a couple brothers that were pretty good. Baseball has always been very important to my family. Yea well I don't have a family. I■m just a foster kid. There was this ball player. A big lefty outfielder I saw him a couple of times. He grew up in a home for boys, And he struck out a few times himself 1,330 times. How'd he stay on the team? In between, he hit 714 home runs. Who was he? Ever hear of Babe Ruth? Sure who hasn't? Lots of people consider him the greatest ball player that ever lived. My new foster dad says its some other old dude, was the greatest Joe D something. Your foster dad sounds like a very smart fellow. Whats your name? Cory. Whats yours? My name is Joe. nice to meet you Cory. Listen to the people that care about you, even the old dudes. And when you go to swing, keep your head in. Always watch that ball try to make contact with the bat. Now you'll never see that happen, But that■s the idea. With confidence. And shoulder to shoulder. Don't forget that. Shoulder to shoulder. Shoulder to shoulder. Show me how you would swing. Shoulder to shoulder. Shoulder to shoulder. That■s the idea, but keep your head right on that ball. That should do the trick. Yea way to go Cory! Ehh lucky shot lucky shot. Luck had nothing to do with that. Ah, we'll see buddy. Ok here■s the deal, you hit this one, I do dishes for a week. Shoulder to shoulder. Hit it downtown Cory! Safe! Safe! Tackle baseball he's out! Is this the circus you were in? Yes, this was the great circus in the age of great circus' And here is my dear friend Dingy. Dingy, Dingy the clown. Is that your elephant? Yes, this is Annabelle. here she was just two months old. Is that your right there? Yes. And who's that? Peter John Peter John sent me this from Burma. Did you marry him? No. Now tell me about you well I live in a foster home right down the street oh, are they good parents? They are my fourth set. Michelle and Dan I need you to pull a job for me. Here, here. Three cups of un-hulled sesame seeds and. Pistachios, if you can find them. And I have to get into the kitchen at night, and that can be tricky. I could get caught. [gasp] You don't want to know what they do to prisoners here. What are you making a bomb? No, halva. Halva? Halva is Turkish candy. Its what angels eat in heaven. Makes you wise. ill give you some. So is that where your from? Turkey? I come from many places. Carlotta your not out here giving your money away are you? No, no I saw you hand money to him. I wasn't aware you were keeping money in your room dear. Young man its not right to take advantage of the elderly, So just give me the money she gave you. Its his money I don't know what your talking about its my money. Do you want me to call miss Hanks and put you into a home for children who steal things? Young man you better come back! Go to your room -music- [knock knock] psst, psst I got it, I got it. So you did not forget. Carlotta, what are you doing? I just wanted some fresh air. Oh you got plenty of air, just lay down and go to sleep huh psst, psst. So was that? The night nurse. she pretends to check on us while she steals our desserts. Here. Now you meet me tomorrow at 4, over by the woods, And I will reward you with halva. Tomorrow at 4. Its been 2 hours. if you see him will you let me know? Ok. Never mind he just walked in the door. Thank you. Where have you been? The store on the corner was closed so... No no! I told you to come straight back its been 2 hours. Don't worry about me ok. We were worried. Dan's sister and her two girls were here. We waited dinner as long as we could. Well, you should have gone ahead and eaten without me I wanted to have dinner together, you know? Like, like a family. And now Dans gone out looking for you. Is he here? He just got here Cory what are we supposed to do? You don't listen in school, you don't do your homework and now you don't come home on time? Well how was I supposed to know you'd be stupid enough not to go ahead and eat without me? Go to your room. No supper tonight, no television tomorrow. Go on! Go now! This is my favorite hideaway. This is great. Did miss Sybil see you go into the woods? She's busy showing some poor souls children around. Oh everything in life circles in life and comes back at you I think you mean, what goes around comes around. Children become the parents, and lock the parents in their rooms. What can miss Sybil do to you for coming out here? One man calls too frequently for the bedpan, and now they give him an extra sleeping pill I only pretend to take their pills I spit them out later. How did you get stuck in this place? Weak heart they said well, what about your family? I have no family well ill be your family. And I will be yours. Hey! Come here you stud muffin. I hate it when you do that. I■ve been waiting for you to get home. Wheres Cory? He's out. Ok lets go. Not that silly I wanted to show you something. What? This. Whats that? Don't you know?

Hey well um I got my test back 85 that■s great, way to go! Let me see that. I sure wish I got marks like this when I was in school. Let me put this up on the refrigerator huh. Uh, Cory listen, um. Why don't you go upstairs and check on Mr. T I don't think he had enough water in his cage. That■s a good idea. Yea, can you do that? Ok. Hello, Mr. T. I■m so excited about the baby I didn■t even think about how Cory is going to take this. Oh this is really going to throw him. How should we tell him? Well I've seen it happen. People will adopt a kid, wife gets pregnant, they have a baby of their own and they say what heck we'll send him back to the agency. Ok, lets make it official before we tell him. Ill call miss hanks in the morning. I am invincible. Your weapons can not touch me. Nothing can hurt me. They can not hurt me. They wont get rid of you Michelle thinks your cute [knock knock] Carlotta are you awake? Carlotta? Cory. I■m running away. I just wanted to say goodbye. Why are you running away? I heard them say they were sending me back to the boys home. This time it will be for delinquence. I■m not going back there. You cannot go. Listen don't try to stop me. ill get away sooner or later. I■m not going where people tell me to go anymore. That■s the mistake you made. You cannot go alone. Why not. Because I'm coming with you. You are? Yes. Can you get out of here? The door is locked at 8pm, but the night nurse has the key. Only she can open it. Now, I need what you call a diversion [doorbell] Poppa's pizza. Who is it? Poppas pizza, that'll be 12.50 for your large supreme pizza. No, I didn't order any pizza. Are you sure nobody here ordered this ultimate, super deluxe, Double pepperoni, triple cheese pizza? Did you say double pepperoni? Double pepperoni. Uh, oh ok. come on in let me see it. That'll be 12.50. Young man are you sure someone ordered that pizza from here? If they had I would of known. Everybody's on a very restricted diet. Well uh, I guess I could take it back. Or, I could give it to you for our preferred customer price of $10.00 00:34:54,842 --> 00:34:55,760 10.00? No tax. You know you seem a little young to be doing this kind of thing. Yea well that■s what my wife said once I shaved my beard off. Um ma'am? It looks like you might have a leak back there. What the? Ooo, ooo. This is ridiculous, whats going on around here? Hey hey! The doors jammed. Hey pizza boy! pizza boy! get me out of here. Cmon cmon! Woo! Yea! Freedom! Hey pizza boy!

Bus driver said grandma, So I thought id better call you grandma. That■s a good idea. You must always call me grandma. Whenever we are around people. That way it will not be suspicious. What do you think they'll do when they find out your gone? They'll call the police, and announce it on television. An elderly woman has wandered away from the Edgewood nursing home. Last seen she was wearing a blue nightgown. They never think old people can decide to go someplace. they just wander off. Suppose they'll figure we went together? It is not likely. Oh look look. Look Cory a cricket. Its time for us to find a room, come on. But first, Lets find a nice place to eat. So what can I get for you? Ill have a cup of coffee please. Cream, sugar? No, just black and uh, Ill have a root beer please. My grandson will have a glass of milk I didn't ask for milk, ill have a root beer. A growing boy needs milk. It would not do for you to get sick. Me and my grandmother will have two milks. That's two milks? You sure? Yea yea, two milks. That■s it! That■s it! That■s it! What are you doing? Sit down! Well you know that halva you make? We can sell it in restaurants, and you know make sides just like... Behind you. These! Do you think they would buy? Yea sure they would, its great stuff, but who do you ever see selling it? We could sell to groceries too. Yea, and I could deliver it to all the customers. You know, I have many many recipes from all over the world I have them all right here. And maybe we can even have our own bakery, and we'll name it after that cricket you saw. Here drink up, drink up we have much to do. It only has one bed. Wait, hold up so it ain■t got but one bed.

Don't take up so much space next time. You ever have any kids? No. So you never had any grandchildren. No, you must have children to have grandchildren I know how it works, its just I never knew if I had a grandmother. Whats it like to be old? Sybil calls old age golden years. What a silly thing that is. There was nothing golden at that place I call them the black years. There■s nothing golden about bed pans and sleeping pills. But. These days Cory, These days, I call golden. May I help you madam? Yea, would you like to order some of our homemade desserts? its halva. Very sweet, very delicious. We make all of our desserts here on the premises. We will not be the least bit interested. Why don't you try some? Madam, please leave. Or I shall be forced to... To what?

Would you like to try some halva ma'am? Oh yes, yes I would. Thank you young man. Halva. mmm oh my. Its wonderful. You know I believe the ladies at the junior league would enjoy this.

See you next week. Got five more restaurants signed up 28 dollars and 31 cents. You know something is wrong. What? There should be more halva, And the bacon is less than there should be. Well I had two sandwiches for lunch I know about that. What do you smell? Ah ha! Where did that bacon come from? From a pig what do you think? Hm, you stole that from us. Come on who knows who's is what? You got your stuff all over the kitchen. You'd know if you bought halva or a pound of bacon, And you saw it had a cricket stamped on the package that it was not yours! You know you got some nerve going around accusing decent hard working folk old woman. Hey! Who you calling old woman. Id like to know why a kid your age ain■t in school. Maybe I should just call the children officer. You know who that is? William Shakespeare. he wrote plays for the theater you know like Romeo and Juliet, and Hamlet and a Mid Summers Night Dream. Oh look Cory. Look! Look at that color. Isn't that interesting? Yea, but I just don't get it you know Cory. Cory art is important. now we must, uh, we must think about school for you. School?

Well then that■s where we will put you, and we will go there tomorrow. You cant do that! They'll want my tickets from the other school. You'll tell them that I taught you at home. Well then who's going to deliver the halva, and the bread, and who's going to get us the new customers. Who's going to do that? You will make the delivery in the morning before school. And I will tell them your birth records were lost [sigh] I think your taking this grandmother thing a little bit too far. Oh I see. You, you want to fire me as your grandmother? We are no longer family? No I didn't mean that. A grandmother would not let you run wild! If we are family than I must treat you as family. Well look, look at this. its wonderful.

Presented by stephana and company. A little clumsy there aren't we candy boy? No, no no. Not now! Get that picked up. come one Cory. Rod pick that up. Mans best friend. most lovable k9's. Are you sure Sebastian did this on purpose? Yes, I'm absolutely positive. Well some people can only think they are big. If they make some one else feel small. The world is full of Sebastians, but things have a way of working. There way around and coming back to you. You mean what goes around comes around. I■ve only got a minute, but I heard what happened. I■m really sorry. Sebastian is such a jerk. Are you alright? Yea, thanks. I■ve got to go. As they say, what goes around comes back at you. Zacharius, the fastest human on two wheels. Thanks [applause] Zacharius! Carlotta, Cory. there is something I have to tell you both. Uh huh. There is a rumor going around the grounds. That you two are doing very well! Oh that■s great dingy! I told the boys to put some stuff in your place to fix it up a little bit. So does that mean we can stay? Boss says he has no choice. Concession sales are up 61%. Woo! 61%! Woo! Oh no stop fooling around! You have to work on your spelling! Grandma? Grandma? We were so beautiful. Stay, stay. Yes dear. you have remembered everything. Peter John taught you. Do you remember the night that Peter John and I danced together. Right here it was. The music came from the pier across the lake. It was if they were playing only for us. ■ Music ■ Thank you, Peter John I knew you would come home. Thank you. Good good! Keep your hands low, good! That■s the way! good good good! Hey dingy, who's your buddy? This is Cory. he and his grandmother joined us last week. She used to be with us in the old show. Nice to meet you Cory, I'm Zack. Hey what are you doing with this no count clown? I am teaching him the ropes Zack, and he learns real fast. Oh yea? Well I might need an assistant. Listen when I'm done courting the school mom. Ill give you a ride on my Harley if you help me. I■m building something secret for my new act, what do you think? Uh yea sure. Cool [engine revving] Ok lets go. Good. Does Zack like ms Lauralie? Well who doesn't? But does she like him? Well uh, that■s a matter of interpretation. You've known my grandmother for a long time haven't you? Oh yes a very long time. Well uh, did you know a man named peter john? It was 1944, and peter john and I were in the same outfit. Our job was to hack a supply line right through the Burma jungle. All the way to China. Did you ever hear of the lido road? No Peter John, he sold our major on the idea of using elephants to clear the way quicker. The last time I ever saw Peter John, I led a patrol, and somehow we stumbled right into the Japanese. We tried to outrun them but they, they had us backed into a revene and they began picking us off like sitting ducks all of a sudden Cory, the ground starts shaking. Son of a gun if I don't see a stampede of elephants ripping right through the Forrest and guess who was sitting on the back of the head elephant? Peter John Peter John. Riding that elephant into the heart of the Japanese camp was the last time I ever saw Peter John. So Peter John and my grandmother never got married. No. Even after the war ended, She never could accept the fact that he was dead. She kept working at the circus day and night. Waiting for him to come home, but Peter John never did. Now don't be looking down there you'll miss the one down there. Now come on, once again! lets see. Hey cor man! Miss Lauralie, I was wondering if I could do my next report on Burma? Yea that'll be fine. You ready for your ride? Sure. I guess. Lets go. Helmet on dude [revving engine] Lauralie, hows the little fellow doing? Well he's doing great, but there■s something I cant figure out. Whats that? I cant get any legal information from him or his grandmother. You cant? well you better stick to it. Get some legal information cause I cant hire a minor that■s undocumented. You know what they'd do to me!? Stick to it. Alright. Cory Wainwright? Wainwright. ■ Music ■ An amazing partnership of man and animal. The breathtaking exotic Bengal tigers. In a rare breed of four color varieties. All eyes on this man. ■ Music ■ Sebastian is about to come on. I thought you'd might want to watch. Are you kidding? No, he's got a new act except he doesn't know it. Come on! Ladies and gentleman, in the rich grand tradition of the circus. the bareback riders featuring the amazing Sebastian [applause] Woa! Put me down you fool! You're ruining my act! Payback time Sebastian! [applause] Oh its just what I told you. What comes in a circle, hits you in the back of the head! She means what goes around comes around. Boss Ed! Boss Ed! Will you tell me what idiots is responsible for this? What are you talking about idiots? They loved you. You needed a hook, and you found it tonight. Let me tell you something, I want those responsible for this fired immediately. Oh you do, do ya? Well you listen to boss Ed and you listen good. I want every performance from you the same way every night. What? Night after night the same way! Understand? ■ Music ■ Woo! Alright! Woohoo! You did great dude. I wonder what Michelle and Dan are doing right now I wonder what happened to your turtle. Mr T? Oh Michelle would have taken good care of him Michelle, she sounds like a good person. I bet she's worried about you. Yea but what can I do? I mean, I cant call her I think you owe them an explanation. Why do I owe them? I heard them planning to send me back to the agency. They were going to call miss Hanks that night. You and the circus were the only family I've ever had. I■m not going to a deliquencent home for kids, or even worse another foster home. Can we talk? Sure I found out something about Cory Rider. He signed his paper Cory Wainwright. I■m sure he didn't realize he had done it. But when I got no help from him or his grandmother on getting his records I called the state education records office, And I asked them to find eleven year old Cory Wainwright. They came up with this. Its his complete history up to a year ago. You■re better than Magnum P.I. He's gone from institutions to foster homes for the last five years. He never stayed anywhere more than a few months. Seems like the only thing constant in his life is that nobody wanted him Zack... At four he witnessed his fathers death. His father was driving a motorcycle. And then a year later his mother abandoned him. He's the kind of kid that usually gets lost forever. You got to give carlotta the credit, but there■s not mention of a grandmother in here somethings wrong I requested an update on the last twelve months and that should give me some answers. He's a natural on a motorcycle. That■s why you're so important to him. So what should I do? Just keep on doing what your doing. I■m going to get some professional advice. This is just way out of my league. ■ Music ■ Dear Michelle and Dan, I■m sorry I left without saying goodbye I found a really great home with great people I hope you are all fine and your new baby will be fine too. Thank you for giving me a good home. Love Cory. P.S. Please take Mr. T to the woods. I know now that he really wants to be free. Who you writing? Nobody. just some old folks I used to know. Oh, where'd you used to live. Different places I cant wait to see zack's new act. Whats it like? Oh you'll see when we get to Norwood. ■ Music ■ Ladies and gentleman, for the first time in our long and celebrated history Clyde Beatty Gold Brothers proudly presents.

Look I want to tell you Cory, that your grandmother is. Well she needs somebody to take care of her. She's too old to start something new and try to work in a circus. And Lauralie, she knows about you being a runaway. And if the state ever found out I hired a run away. They would close me down just like... like that. huh? You wouldn't want that, would ya?
