I will stay red until tonight! You are not red anymore. Asshole! Asshole! Asshole! Asshole! Asshole! Asshole! Asshole! Asshole! Asshole! It is always the same question. When you go downhill just past Reinhardtstrasse, whether you enjoy the downward movement and let go of the bike, or whether you pedal, so you can go even faster? So, do you enjoy going downhill and let go, or don't you enjoy it and try to move even faster? I think I pedal a little. I noticed, that when I don't think I simply enjoy going downhill. But when I think, I pedal and I don't enjoy it anymore! My mother is already here. Hello! Hello! And the silly thing is, that since I had this thought for the first time, it came back to me again and again at this point on Reinhardtstrasse, so that going downhill... - Morning! Morning. ...so that going downhill is not as enjoyable as it used to be. Next time you can force yourself not to pedal consciously. At the beginning you might not enjoy it but... You are right. Hello mum. Hi, my dear, there you are. I unpacked the carrots and potatoes. Oh god, I forgot the crisps. What? I brought crisps. - Yes? Oh, you want the books back. - Sure! But after a while she will be able to enjoy it. I also have a thought at a certain point on Reinhardtstrasse. Or rather a problem. - What is it? On a certain crossing I never know how to get into the bikeline. Hello! Hello Nadine! Good to see you. Are you ok? - Yes. And you? God, that looks terrible. It looks terrible but it wasn't that bad. Do you remember our neighbours? Did you hear it, too? - Unbelievable! They moved to Australia! No, the youngest stayed here. Who was it again? - Didn't you go to school with him? Ah, I know. He was so handsome. I always feel like I obstruct the traffic. And then I expect the cars to blow their horns. Draw the situation and I can show you how to get into the bike lane. You still have the teapot? Of course. I don't have mine anymore. I poured hot water, like always. I placed it on the sideboard. And then I turned away. And suddenly I heard a sound. "Plopp"! As if it had waited for me to turn away. I turned around, and looked, and there it was. Broken into two pieces that were still moving slightly. And around it, a steaming lake. Can I take a shower first? Ok. I have seen the pictures in the party room. They are beautiful! Did you make them for today? No, I had them already. On my computer. They are digital collages. When I'm working in the office, when I design posters or illustrations, I sometimes end up with parts of images that I can't use for the project I'm working on. I collect these in a folder. Sometimes at night I assemble these pictures into new pictures. Janine wanted me to print out three of these collages and put them up for her party. She also said that they are beautiful. Mark gets the music. Mark is looking for the music. When I used to live with my parents, I had a sketch book. I observed things and drew them. And other things I drew from imagination. And when I was bored, I took the sketch book and looked at it. I took the sketch that I liked most when flicking through it and copied it to good paper. After finishing the drawing I put it on my desk. In the right corner. A carrot dropped from my hand. Then my mother took the finished drawing from the desk, and looked for a frame to put it in. On the 2nd floor of the house, back in the hall, she put up all the framed drawings. Sometimes I went there and looked, sometimes she went there and looked. Then we would stand there for a few minutes, immersed in the pictures. As if in a museum. But we never went there together. Always alone. And now you don't draw by hand anymore? No. Now I don't draw by hand anymore. How was the cruise? It was quite nice. Can you take out your laundry? Yes! Asshole! Half an hour. - Half an hour, great. I still need to practice a little. And put lots of salt, I forgot that recently. - Morning. So, I will put out the crisps for you and then I also have to take off. Yes! 20, 30, 50... Ok! You are a caricature. Thanks. Let me know if you need anything else! Bye! Have fun! Bye! Thanks! I am an ugly bitch! Have to practice and look like shit! Looks nice! Yes. Here's the stage for Janine's show. And later on it all turns into a hot dance floor, where bodies find each other and enmesh and emotions glow. Wow! And I put up your pictures, too! Shit! Hi Nini, what's up? Hello. Yes, I also think that's good. Have you plans for tonight or are you already busy? Can I leave the door ajar so I can hear you better? Yes. I am a caricature as well. And can you move again now? I lied to your mother. I told her I used to have a sketch book, that I used to draw a lot and then looked at framed drawings. That doesn't matter! Yes, it does matter! Nice, how the pictures are put up. - Yes, and nice, the music. Nice, how it sounds. In a sect! I rather call you tomorrow morning because I don't quite know how late it's going to be tonight. Yes, I will! There will be lots of people: Claire, and... Pia, und... ...Phillip. Was Claire fit, or was Claire not fit? That's wicked! Bless you! - Thanks! I was also sweating so badly just from sitting in the sun. I was sitting in the shade and then the sun came out and first I didn't notice it, then I realized it because I had sweat all over my face. Claire says hi? We'll see each other in a moment. "Hi" back to her. What are you doing there? I smell the skin of my head to check if it stinks. Look! Yeah? What? Don't I have unbelievably yellow teeth? With this white foam my teeth look extremely yellow! Yes. Normally they don't look so yellow. As you said, the white foam makes your teeth look yellow. The mean white foam! If a room is getting free at your place let me know. Great. From when on? But they do want a girl, don't they? So you think it could fit? So you don't have to hold the window anymore. Now you are free! "Plopp". And then I turned around and looked, and there it was: broken into two pieces that were still moving slightly. And around it, a steaming lake. Did you drop a cup? - Yes. Are you sad that I'm going away? Yes, I'm sad. Do you know, what I like most about him? I like the hairline at the back of his neck. And his hairline at the temples. And what I like most is how the sunlight sets a sparkling dot on every single hair of his stubble. All that I like about him. What was that? A teabag fell from the sky.
