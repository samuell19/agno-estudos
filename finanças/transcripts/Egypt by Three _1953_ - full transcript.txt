## ## [narrator] Egypt, ancient and fabled land of the inscrutable Sphinx, the mighty Pharaohs and the dark mystery of the Nile. Yes, Egypt is rich in story and legend from the days of the divine Cleopatra on up through the centuries to this very moment. Even now lovers in Egypt communicate in a strange romantic code. ## Here is a fan... and a rose... and a violin string. And lastly, this knife. Let me show you what these objects meant to two people who loved each other in the glamorous city of Cairo. [orchestra playing inside nightclub] [music ends] [applause] [drum roll] [cymbal crash] [applause] [drum roll] [cymbal crash] [applause] Why do you insist on coming here every night? But, Gregor, this is the first nightclub I've been to in all my life. Besides... Besides what? Shh. [drum roll] [cymbal crash] [applause] [drum roll] [cymbal crash] [applause] Told him a dozen times. He still makes the same mistakes. What are you complaining about now? The electrician. He spotlights me at the wrong time. He uses the wrong colors. He forgot one light completely. Really? I didn't notice. I wouldn't expect you to notice. Of course, if your uncle was any sort of a manager, he'd take care of these things. Florie, don't you think this is just about enough? Five years ago, we were playing the backstreets of Tangiers. Uncle Tavis changed all that, yes? Well, we're not in Tangiers now. You didn't answer my question. All right, Uncle Tavis, Uncle Tavis, Uncle Tavis. You're more concerned with him and your brothers than with anything else, including me. Florie! The Madrano family against the world. Well, I don't like it. You're a Madrano too, remember? I'll never be a Madrano. [men laughing] Will you leave me alone? It went well, eh? For you, yes. For me, the same as usual. Hey Tony, look at this new number. [orchestra resumes in club] He's the sucker. We're playing. Ol?! Carr?! Carr??! [grunts] You like it, Tony? Great! Do you like it? We'll see how it will work out in rehearsal tomorrow. What's the matter, Anton, you don't feel well? I'm all right. Tell him about the booking we have in Rome. That'll cheer him up. Oh, yes, yes, Rome. I've just received a wire from the Palace Hotel. We start our engagement there in two weeks. At an increase in salary. I know, you need a good drink. Get the glasses. Look, uh, all of you, I'm sorry. I'd like to be alone for a little while. Would you mind? Sure, Anton. No, that's all right. Tody, not you. I'd like you to wait a minute. What is it, Tony? I need a favor. Anything. But, Tody, this must be just between the two of us. What do you want me to do? I need four things. Yes? A fan, a rose, the string of a violin and a gold knife. But Tony... Will you get them for me? Of course, but... I know what I'm doing, believe me. She's been in the gardens every night for a week. I can't get her face out of my mind. Which one? The dark girl. She sits at a table on the right. Oh, yes, I've seen her. But she always sits with a man, the same one. [laughs] That's her brother. I've checked into that. He won't cause any trouble. I hope not. Anyway, wait until he's gone, arrange it so she's alone before you deliver the message. What about Florie? She's not a Madrano. She said so herself. [applause] ## It's always such a problem to get a cab at this time of night. I'm in no hurry. But I don't like being kept waiting. Stay here, I'll be back in a few minutes. I have a buggy waiting for you. This is for you, Miss. ## Wait! I received this from a friend. What does it mean? You are not from Egypt? No, Johannesburg. This is very simple. The fan signifies your friend wishes to pay you an evening visit. The flower, that you meet in a garden. And the violin string, that there will be music. But the knife, this I myself know not the meaning of. Oh, I understand what that means. It denotes your friend. How do I answer in the same way? It's very beautiful. What do you wish to say? Well, that he must wait. Then send him a piece of air plant because it will live for many months without water and this signifies he must have patience. Yes, and I also want to say that... Who sent this to you? Gregor, I didn't... Throw it away. But, Gregor, you're acting foolish. I'm not a schoolgirl anymore. Don't be an idiot. The man is married and you know that. Yes, but... Now listen, Gina, if you don't want to return home to your father at exactly this instant, you'll do as I say. Now throw it away! Gregor! Oh, all right. You treat me as if I were a child. Only because you are one. Garden City, Villa of the Roses. [horse trotting, bells jingling] Going someplace? Out. Hmm. I figured as much. Well, where are you going? Look, Florie, do me a favor, will you? Don't ask any more questions. Just let me alone. I suppose you and your brothers will go someplace and get drunk. Yeah, that's it. Well, what am I supposed to do in the meantime? Count the flowers on the wallpaper? The shops are open. Go buy yourself something. You usually do. Alone? I never heard of you going alone on these little excursions. How do you know? Been spying? I don't have to spy. I simply know you too well. Sure, the wisdom of the ages resides in that fat head of yours. You know, there's one thing I love about you, Florie. You're always so full of compliments. You haven't heard my best ones yet. I've heard them. I've heard them all. Believe me. ## Garden City, Villa of the Roses. ## Did I frighten you? Only for a moment. I know you couldn't answer my message. I wanted to. What would you have said? "Come to see me." What's your name? Gina. Gina... ## Oh, Anton, I've thought of you every minute since I first saw you. And I you. I couldn't wait any longer. I'm glad you couldn't. But I don't think we'll be able to see each other any longer. Your brother? Mm-hmm. He's my bodyguard, chaperone, everything. My father let me make this trip only on the condition that I'd never be out of his sight. Where are you from? Far to the south... Johannesburg. In two weeks, I go to the north... Rome. I'll never forget you. We still have two weeks. I want to learn all about you. For once in my life, I want to be with someone who's kind and gentle and truly beautiful. We will then, Anton, somehow, some way, for two weeks. You're very brave. I must leave now. My brother might notice. I'll go alone. If he asks any questions, I'll say I went for a walk and couldn't sleep. Good night, Gina. ## [applause] Disappearing again tonight, Tony? Yes. Uncle Tavis, I'd like to speak to Tony alone. He can stay. No, Anton, I don't want to. I haven't got time to talk now, Florie. I've something to say and it won't wait. All right, what is it? I'm not going to Rome with Tody, Vito, Belo and Uncle Travis. Oh? We don't need those tumblers along to get work. Besides, I'm sick and tired of them. They're loud, stupid boors. I don't want to have to see them again. Loud, stupid boors. In all the time we've been together, you haven't made one effort to get to know them. You've been insulting, selfish and cruel. You hurt them deeply many times without cause. Sure, stand up for them. You're just like they are. I should have known it from the start. I'm sorry you made the mistake. You're not leaving. Get out of the way, Florie. No. ## Sorry I'm late, Gina. I was worried. What happened? Everything's all right... now. And before? I'm leaving for Rome tomorrow. Oh. But it, it needn't be forever. These times we've been together have been too wonderful. It just can't end now. I'll be leaving for home soon. My vacation will be over. Then I'll see you in Johannesburg. I don't think so, Anton. They watch me even more closely there. They'll probably marry me off to somebody and that's that. Gina, will you marry me? But... I'll get a divorce. Go to Paris. Wait for me. Yes, Anton... yes. My brother! Go down to the river and get in one of the boats and wait there. Anton... Go on, I'll talk to him... go on, hurry. Where's Gina? Where'd you send her? She's all right. She's waiting for me. For you, you scum? Listen to me... Dirty scum. Listen! I'll kill you! [loud crack] What happened? You're bleeding. We started fighting. He wouldn't listen to me. Is he all right? Yeah, I think so. [boatman singing in Arabic] [continues singing] I wish our first time on the Nile together could have been different. There'll be other times, Anton. Yes, other times. But we must make some plans. Anything you say. First, I don't want you to go back to your place in Garden City. All right, Anton. I'll take you to a little respite near my hotel. You'll be safe there. It's run by some friends of mine. And then? I have one more thing to do, then I'll come back for you. You will wait, won't you? I'll be there, Anton. I'll be there. [singing resumes] I'm sorry. That's all I can say. Sorry? Oh, no, Tony. You're not half as sorry as you're going to be. ## Give me the police. [phone rings] Hello? Chief speaking. Yes, I saw it with my own eyes. He picked up a heavy stone and killed him. Yes... yes, Anton, Anton Madrano. He's staying here at the Mina House Hotel. I'm his wife, Florie Madrano. [buzzer] ## What number is Anton Madrano in? Tony, the police, they're coming for you. The police? Why? What is it? They say you killed someone by the Nile. Killed? Tony, did you? I, I don't know. I didn't think I killed him. Well, what are you going to do? I've got to get out of here. Wait here. You too. Don't try to come up! You'll get one through your heart! Tear gas will smoke him out. ## Have you determined which apartment is his? Yes, Inspector, third floor, corner on the left. Move back, Madrano! We're gonna fire through the window! All right, go ahead. [gunshot, window breaks] ## Move back, Madrano! I'm going to fire! [gunshots] Stop it! Stop it. Get back. Please, I'm his wife. Let me talk to him. People will be hurt, killed. Let me go to him. I'll bring him out. All right. Hold your fire! Tony! Tony! You happy now? Listen to me, Tony. They'll kill you. They'll cut you down. What do you want? I can get you out of here safely. How? You didn't kill that man. I saw the whole thing. Someone else came after you left and stoned him to death. Why should the police believe you again? I can lead them to the murderer. He stole a diamond ring. They'll find it on him. Why are you doing this now, Florie? What do you want from me? That you never see Gina again. That you come with me to Rome. And if I don't agree to your little... bargain? Tony, I'll go back to the police. I'll tell them I couldn't reason with you. [knife clanks] Let's go. ## [applause] [drum roll] [cymbal crash] [drum roll] [cymbal crash] [drum roll] ## [narrator] In our next story, it is an hourglass which measured an amazing moment of crisis in many lives. ## Here now is a caravan on a holy mission to Mecca. This is Egypt today or a thousand years ago. Certain good things never change in this land of history, even when the past and the present clash on these ageless sands. ## [camels nuzzing... a rumbling growl... "nuuurrr..."] Oh, Magician, powerful one, please come and gaze upon my child for he is sick and only you can summon the powers to help him. A pox... only in the heat does one choose to be taken sick. Please, oh, Magician, the child needs help and we can pay you, not much, but whatever we have. Is the child in the shade? In our tent. His head is burning. Feel it, oh, Magician. It's as if an afrit is clutching at his throat. Is it because I've been ill-tempered that he's being punished? Shh... ## In the name of God, the only God, creator of all powerful wishes, whom eyes do not see and thought cannot conceive, protect the bearer of this, my charm, from the devilish cursed afrits. Let the beneficial light of thy face burn the cursed afrits and cast them into the fire so that this boy may continue to walk in your grace. [speaking in Arabic] Do you know what's expected of you? [drums playing] [music playing] [music continues] Sheik Omar of Tripoli. Salaamu alaykum. Alaykum al-salaam. I am Dr. Mahmud and this is Dr. Walter Jansen from America. We're sent by the American Foundation. Here are our credentials. Thank you very much. I do not read. During the pilgrimage season, you and your caravan must be inspected before we can send you into the country. Inspected? There may be those among you who are carrying disease. If that's the case, our only wish is that we try to prevent them from spreading it. We carry nothing that cannot be seen by the eye. I am an Egyptian and from the chant and the tabul, it would seem that someone is ill. If you are an Egyptian, then you know very well that someone from our own midst is able to take care of him. The person more than likely has nothing contagious. It's a matter for the boy and his parents. This is a matter of public health. It's a matter for the sick one and his parents. If they permit you entrance, I cannot insist otherwise. Peace be with you. Come. [wind blowing] Salaamu alaykum. How do you feel? I won't hurt you. I want to help you. Who are his good parents? We are. We are doctors. How long has he been like this? It started two nights ago. He complained as though he had been poisoned by something. I'm sure it is nothing serious, but with your permission, we should like to take a blood sample back to our laboratory. It is a matter of course and will give him no pain. Do not listen. I perceive that one has an evil eye. Nonsense! He is a friend of mine. He has an evil eye nevertheless. If you believe that, he will give you an article of clothing which you can burn, thus destroying any evil. In the name of Allah, the only God, I promise you no pain. Give me your hand. [short yelp] Thank you. Salaamu alaykum. [group] Alaykum al-salaam. You have an evil eye. Throwing sand is another precaution against it. [laughs] ## Bubonic plague. What? No. I knew it. Do you have it in your power to call out the police? There are only ten policemen at El Habib I could put them at your service if necessary. I want a cordon placed around that caravan. Nobody is to get in or out other than the medical staff. ## [camels nuzzing] What's the meaning of all this? The boy is in that tent. Isolate him until we can set up a hot zone. Yes, Doctor. I'm sorry, Sheik Omar, but your encampment is under quarantine. Quarantine? No one will be permitted past the police until it's safe. That boy we saw this morning has the bubonic plague. It was your word to the parents that the boy was not unduly sick. I had to say so. There have been occasions when, at the sound of "bubonic plague," people have fled in panic, spreading the disease everywhere they went. You'll be delayed six days. That's the duration prescribed. That's the time it takes to make sure you're not contagious. It is our people's custom to take care of their own sick. Out of respect for themselves and the thousands of worshippers in Mecca whom they might contaminate, they must sacrifice custom. This disease can be transmitted. [Magician] Bubonic plague is the work of the devil and only the spirits can help us. I think we'll give it a whirl too. Let's set up our tents over here and start work. If you please, oh, Doctor, we have planned that our baby see the first light of day in the reflection of the Prophet's Kaaba. Can we not be made an exception? I'm afraid not. If the baby's born here, I can only promise it'll be given the best of care. Care is not what we require. My good wife and I are capable of giving it that. The reason we go on this pilgrimage is to get for our child what no other human being is capable of giving. I'm sorry, there's nothing more I can say. ## Next. Come on, come on! Give two shots to the next person who tries that! ## Oh, spirit Tata, oh, spirit Avya, oh, spirit Utika, who dwell on the ground and communicate with me and only me. Touch me once if it is the will of Allah that this girl bears her child here in the desert. Touch me twice if it is the will of Allah that she and her husband steal away to Mecca, the land of our Prophet. Hey, what do you think you're doing? This mother-to-be has suffered the jolts of a camel all this way so as to bear a child in the reflection of Kaaba. It was to her question I sought an answer. The answer is there's a plague in this camp. An illegal departure will be treated as a crime. If you're not halted by bullets, you'll have to answer to the authorities. There's no way out of here anyhow. [engine running] Wait. I want to look into something. My child will be born in Mecca. On that I swear. ## How is he? Respiration improving. Temperature's a little better too. They just won't cooperate out there. We're trying to save their lives and they won't let us. Can you remember how you behaved the first time your mother tried to force castor oil on you? I'm sure you didn't give her an easy time. Yes, but they're adults. And the better reason to treat them as such or we may have some trouble on our hands such as we have never seen. What kind of trouble? The Quran says let no man hinder another from visiting the holy mosque lest he suffer the consequences. Ought to go easy on them. Look, Mahmud, after three weeks, 18 hours a day trying to track this disease down, I'm out of patience. I haven't the time nor the energy to coddle them. At least reason with them. You're a strange combination of science, religion and psychology. How they're compatible, I don't know. But I must act as only my good sense instructs me to act. Of course, but you must recognize that they are people of the same strain as I. My understanding of them makes it sometimes difficult for me not to sympathize too much with them. Oh, I tried to reason with them a little while ago, but it was only after threatening that I learned that two others in the caravan died en route of the same symptoms. I don't know. In America, you just don't stop talking to your doctor. How is it that you choose to come on such an assignment so far from all that is familiar to you? My work was with the public health office in San Francisco investigating contagious diseases brought in by ships. When word came from the American Foundation of outbreaks of bubonic plague here in North Africa, I volunteered. I was qualified. To leave one's country to help another's takes more than just qualifications... unselfishness of a high order. Hmm, maybe. On the other hand, it might be considered very selfish. Disease doesn't recognize any frontiers. What happens here can be communicated anywhere in the world: in Mecca, in America. There I go again. Got a cigarette? [man] Doctor! Doctor! Two have gotten out. Who? Where? The couple. Their name is Kasmit. What are you talking about? That woman is about to have a baby any minute. How could they get by? I don't know. But the supply truck was here this morning. They might have slipped away in it. Radio El Habib, Mecca and Cairo. Have the police given all the particulars about them and if you catch them, don't forget to isolate them. Yes, Doctor. [laughs] I won't waste words with you. Did you help the Kasmits to run off? Which route did they take? Whichever route, they'll end up at the Prophet's Kaaba. Look, you, an epidemic could be set off in Mecca like a string of firecrackers. They must be brought back. It's the will of Allah that they bear a child in Mecca. It's the will of the world that they don't. Look, I'm losing my patience. Which route did they take? My ears are sealed. I cannot hear you. Tell me! You've got to tell me! Oh, kindred spirits, communicate with me and help me rid afrits in the form of a man. Give me a signal. Where's your vaccination? Haven't you been vaccinated? No. You will seal my death with the devil's poison. Take this man to the hospital and see to it that he's inoculated. Get away from me! I will put you in a curse that will make you and your offspring bloat up like dead fish. Hear me. One morning you will find not just two, but all of us are vanished. You will awaken with nothing but our mockery in your ears. Take him away. Leave me! Leave me! ## Looks all right out there, doesn't it? It looks calm enough. They wouldn't dare try to sneak out. They couldn't get by the police anyway, not the whole bunch of them, without any arms. I imagine not. Oh, that magician was just blowing his top. Four whole days and nothing's happened. I don't get it. [gasping] Oh, Sheik, hear me. It is written here their defeat. Calm yourself, man. What is written? Feel, this is government paper! And read, read what it says! You know none of us can read here. What does it say? It has many words, but this is what it says. That at the end of the two more days, we will not be permitted to continue on to the Prophet's Kaaba but will be sent back to our homeland. Where did you get this? From the tent there. There's a radio and a machine that writes. Are you sure that this is what it says? As sure as it is that I can communicate with three spirits, so it is the truth what I have told you. They have deceived us. With the will of Allah, now we leave here. But what of the guards? They shall only see our tracks and not those if there is a wind. Assemble all of the people together and take out the musical instruments. Musical instruments? We will throw deceit back in their faces which will make theirs seem pallid. [drums playing] [clapping to the music] How's it going? As long as the music keeps playing, we know they're there. They'll be there for another two days, I assure you. [music and clapping continue] Carry on. Change guard. No, leave that be. Tents on the outer circle must be left up for them to see. [music and clapping continue] [water splashing] [music and clapping continue] Sheik, a signal! How many times did it flash altogether? Four times. That means six guards remain. Is everything in readiness? Yes, sir. The packages? On the camel. That's good. Fetch me my plain white robe, for it is appropriate in performing Allah's will that I wear what is most humble. What happened? Some of the caravan. I turned and they jumped on me. Are you sure? Could it have been someone from town who wanted your rifle or something? They came from the encampment. [music continues] The tents are still up. They couldn't be trying to slip out of here. Go warn your captain and alarm the guards quick and bring a machine gun to my tent. Yes, sir. ## The machine gun, Doctor. Fire it over the encampment. [click] [gunfire] [people shouting] Call the Minister of Health. Tell him we need troops here right away. [on loudspeaker] Sheik Omar, I'm asking to let me meet with you. If you go ahead without talking with me, not only will your lives and our lives be at stake but thousands of others in Mecca. Is the bubonic plague the gift you want to bring to the Holy City? All I ask is to talk to you for ten minutes. It is a trick. It is certain he has called the troops and wishes to detain us until they come. Let's go. This is the way they react to reason. I was right, wasn't I? Don't stop talking. Listen, Sheik Omar, please give me ten minutes. After that, you can do anything you want to do, just give me ten minutes. Have you called for the troops? Yes, but you know as well as I do that they're a long way out of Cairo. It'll take them two hours to get here. All I want is ten minutes. Send for the police officer here first! If this is a trick and anything happens to me, he will be killed instantly! The police lieutenant is willing to come. One more thing! I bring along my man to counsel me. That is agreed provided I can bring along Dr. Mahmud to be my counsel. It is agreed! ## When the sand reaches the top, ten minutes will be exhausted. Sheik, as doctors we don't like bloodshed. I'm sure we can come to some understanding. I shall listen to what you say... I promise no more. All right, let's begin. Why do you want to leave in this manner? We will not be deprived of visiting our Prophet's shrine. I asked you to stay six days. There are only two more. And then by your deceit, we are to be returned to our homeland. Who told you that? It was written on a paper you were to send out. What paper? I found it there. There was no such paper. I can read English. What is black and white cannot be denied. This is fantastic. To a man of another religion, a pilgrimage to Mecca may seem unimportant. On the contrary, I have the greatest respect for religious devotion of any kind. The Christians themselves make pilgrimages to Jerusalem and the Vatican every year. For basically all religions are universal in their belief in one God, the Holy Prophets, resurrection of life and the hereafter. Because we believe in all this, we have no doubt as to the righteousness of our leaving. Our work is in the service of God and to die for him is to attain Paradise. But you're thinking only of yourselves. I'm afraid this is getting us nowhere. [phone rings] I will take it. Hello, Dr. Mahmud speaking. Tell the captain we can't speak to him now. What? Hurry up. I will tell him immediately. That was the police captain in Cairo. They've just found the Kasmit couple. The girl had her baby on a lonely road outside the city, couldn't go on. It was dead. Yes, bubonic plague caught from the mother. It is a trick. They can say anything on the telephone. They'll bring the girl back... let her tell you herself. By the time she's here, so will be the troops. She killed her own baby. Murder is no worse. You and your caravan, if you leave, will be guilty of just such a crime, only multiplied by your own numbers. Don't weaken, Sheik, your people will think you're afraid of this man. Stop, stop, stop, sit down, sit down. I know what I must do. Many years ago, Alexander the Great, who is spoken of in the Quran, was faced with a decision of sending his legions east to Persia or returning them home. He sent three of his pigeons into the air. If they flew east, he would besiege Persia, or west, back to Macedonia. Thus will I do. I will send one of my best pigeons into the air. If it flies east, our caravan will continue on to Mecca immediately, if west, we shall abide by your wishes. It is done. ## All right, bird, fly with our blessings and may the direction you take be the right one. ## West![others exclaim] ## Unload the camels. We shall stay two more days. ## I'm confounded. I nearly had a nervous breakdown through the whole thing and you're as calm as the Nile. The Sheik never finished his story about Alexander the Great. You see, there was danger of the leaders rebelling if Alexander pushed onto Persia. And he had no other choice but then to return them home. However, there was the problem of saving face with his generals and his public, so Alexander let the pigeons take the responsibility. They flew west. They had to. Alexander had selected them because they were homing pigeons. ## [narrator] Can you laugh at diamonds like these? Well, thereby hangs a tale. ## Were you wondering if there is laughter in Egypt? By all means. As you will see, laughter wells up in the oddest places. It was foolish not to bring water. I'm thirsty. Yeah. Listen, Nick, the essence of our business are the little details. We can't forget the essence. No, I didn't forget the essence. I had a drink of water before we left the village, did you? I didn't have a drink of water or anything else. I was talking to Henry. Oh, that Henry's a good guy to stay away from. Listen, Nick, you should see the diamonds he's got. He's got more diamonds than there are bricks and as ugly as every one of those bricks is, that's how beautiful the diamonds are. The light shines and shimmers through them. Aw, listen, we're not having any truck with stolen goods. But all he requires is our assistance to take the material out of the country. And for that simple assistance, we get 50%. Charlie, we got a deal and it's a cinch. There it is over there, the church. Forget about your diamonds. [bell jingles] [door creaking] Is the master of the house in? Uh, is the Father Superior on the premises? ## Seems to me this establishment could use a few repairs. [bells chiming] Try to look pious. I can look as pious as you can any day. ## Welcome. We have little to offer, but that little you may have. Thank you, Father. Yeah, thank you very much, Father. It is not often that strangers happen by, especially from faraway lands. Oh, but we didn't just happen by, Father, this was our specific destination. Why so? Oh, we've heard a lot about your place. Uh, the traditions of the Coptic Orthodox Church have reached our ears and we feel it's a pity that so worthy a cause is not better known throughout the whole world. Ah. [speaking in Arabic] The world would be a much better place to live in if the people could have the advantage of your example and blessing. My heart burns with the fire of gratitude that you feel so. [speaking in Arabic] This is the stuff. Money in the bank. These come from our own ovens and are blessed for all of us. Yes, we've heard a lot about your holy bread. As a matter of fact, that's why we're here. Really? I did not know holy bread had such fame. It's a pity that they don't and that's our desire. As my partner... uh, my compatriot... has said, we're here because of your organization. Now the Coptic Orthodox Church and its good deeds must be better known throughout the entire world. And we've decided that we're the ones who are going to do it. That fills me with gladness. Will you come and see our church? Of course. Is it not beautiful? It has been here a long time. Yes, we know and we're astonished. Since the year one, the Coptic Christians have lived side by side with the Moslems. Oh, Father, your story must be known. But how, my son? With your holy bread. We could sell them to Ethiopia. Sell our holy bread? Why not, Father? The French monks sold the wine from their vineyards. It's simple business. After all, you can keep the profit from every bread that we sell. Sell our holy bread? We could sell just enough to cover the cost of transportation and enough flour to make the bread. Surely, no one would want to make a profit out of such an enterprise. Well, we could make a little profit. After all, these folks want to add to the kitty for the poor. Kitty? Uh, that's just an American expression meaning charity. My friend Mr. Nicholas here is a very charitable man. It is he. I never saw her before in my life. He has come in answer to my prayers. Of course we have, my dear. We have come in answer to your prayers, to spread the story of the Coptic Orthodox Church throughout the entire world. Yes, that's it. Who's in charge of the bakery? I am and she is my niece. Well, that's fine. I wonder how many breads we can bake every day. Oh, it doesn't matter. Whatever it is, we'll just step up production, mass production, that's all. He's come to help us feed the poor. Now with every bread that we bake, why we'll insert the story of the Coptic Orthodox Church. Tell me, you have any printing material here? We have in the village a scribe. A moment, my children. To sell our holy bread... You figure he'll go for it? It's a pushover. Well, I figure we'll sell 50,000 in Ethiopia at a 20-cent minimum profit. Splitting with our contact man, that makes five grand for us. It's not bad, we're still on the legit. Listen, is that distributor really honest over there? Oh, now look, Nick. It's the little details where I shine and that's one detail I took care of. That distributor's honest. Hmm, talking about little details, did you check to see if there's a hotel in town? Yep, and we're in luck. There isn't any. They gotta put us up. We have decided and I hope that my decision will please you. We are going to send our holy breads to Ethiopia, not to sell them but to give them free. Oh, that'll ruin everything. Uh, what he means, Father, is that if there isn't any profit, well, there won't be any charity for the poor and we won't be able to cover the expenses for the transportation of the material or the flour for the bread. Or to pay for the roof. True, I'd forgotten the roof. But anyhow the roof is not important but the stomachs of our poor people are. [talking quietly] This time he's sold, but how do we get the money from the distributor to pay for that flour and the transportation? Get the pre-signature on the contract. Ship it to Ethiopia. Then our distributor cables us the dough. It will be as you say, my sons. How could it be otherwise than you say it since you are helping us? Now, Father, it's getting rather late and we haven't yet made any arrangements for lodging at a hotel. The nearest hotel is two hours away. And I am going to make arrangements with our people for finding you a room in this village. Mary has three rooms. John has an extra bed. Mark the musician has one also. Is not my mother's house good enough for them? There's a room for my mother and me and a room for them. Of course, my child. It is settled... come. Go with Miriam, my sons. You are in good hands. Okay, partner, we'll take your word for it. Tomorrow with the rise of the sun, we will make preparations for our project. Good day, Father. Good day. ## [rooster crows] Thank you, my child. Yeah, thank you, child. [all cheering] What's going on? They're paying you great honor. The first-born lamb. For what? They've heard, Nick, that you've come to make work for them, that the carpenters will be paid to make crates, that you'll repair the church. Hey, stay out of the act, Charlie. I'm the big shot now. They figure you're just my stooge. The fruits of the season. [cheering] You know, these are real nice people, huh, Charlie? Oh, you got 'em eating out of your hand. [man] Salaam Alaykum! Hiya! You know, it would be a cinch to get Henry's diamonds across Africa. No, no, no, we're not doing anything crooked, at least nothing that's out and out crooked. I go up that street there. You'll stay away from Henry, won't you? Going to the cable office to send a wire to Addis Ababa. Good, that's fine. Tell him to send the dough because we can't get started until we put the money on the line. Okay, I'll tell him. I'll see you later. Ah, smells good. Mulukhiyah. Mula-what? Mulukhiyah. Did you have success in your endeavors? Sure did, baby. Oh, I'm glad. Already your name is whispered with gladness that is used in telling of the approach of rain clouds that could end a drought. Are you hungry? Oh, I could eat a horse. Then eat. Hey, Charlie, soup's on. How'd it go? Fine. Send for the money? Sure did. It better come. Don't worry, it will. Well, it just better. What's eating you? I got credit. What? For the first time in my life, I got credit. What? I said for the first time in my life, I got credit. Will you make sense? What, are you ignorant or something? The people of Abu Sefen feel it's a big honor to do business with me. Why, I got credit. I got the scribe writing for me, cutting paper for me, the miller grinding flour. Why, all this on my say-so. If you dare get religion on me... I'm not getting religion. I just got everything set up to go in a few days and I don't want anything to go wrong. The money just better get here, that's all. ## Here you go. Help yourself. Cut 'em off good. Get a load of this, Father. This is the paper we wrap the holy breads in. Of course, after you bless them. This paper tells of the good deeds of the Coptic Church. We'll make the Coptic Church a household word throughout the world! [all exclaim] ## What are you, Chief Inspector or something? Your humor is becoming more obnoxious with your advancing age. Did the money come? In a word, no. What's wrong with that guy in Ethiopia? Why don't he send the money? It's probably on its way. Nothing to worry about. No, not for you, but for me. These people are depending on me. By the way, you've been acting awful funny the last few days. Where you been keeping yourself? Ooh, I've been communing with Egypt's nature. You're not the only one, Nicholas, who can expand under the influence of the Nile. Aw, shut up. [bell rings] What's the bell all about? They're knocking off for lunch. ## Beautiful, isn't it? I got a whole bag full of 'em. So you had to go and get involved with that crook Henry. We're rich, Nick, we're rich. We're the big time now. We don't have to play around with penny-ante stuff anymore. Henry took all the risk, we get half the profit. Look, Charlie, we're not crooks. We ain't supposed to take the chance of going to jail. We're brain boys, remember? But it takes brains to work out a mathematical certainty such as this. Einstein himself couldn't figure out a better formula. Well, why you putting them in the dough? What better medium for getting them past the customs? You crumb bun. You want to get all these sweet priests thrown into jail? Ah, they won't get thrown in the jail. Nothing's going to happen to 'em. I can just see the headlines: "Priests in a smuggling ring "running stolen goods out of Egypt, diamonds in the dough." Ah, there's no chance of discovery. Why aren't you ever satisfied, Charlie? I'll figure it out for you myself. 50,000 breads, we get a dime profit. That makes five grand and we're still honest men. Yeah, but think of this. Only 112 holy breads and each one with a diamond in it. And we get $50,000. These diamonds will get over 100 grand and we get half. And all we got to do is put each of 112 diamonds into each of 112 holy breads. Oh, we can't take a chance of hurting these people. They got confidence in us. You want to help those people? Yeah. All right, what do they have for lunch every day? Uh, soup. And for dinner? Bread. And with the haul that we make out of these diamonds, we don't have to take any profit from the holy bread. We'll give it all to the priests. And they'll be able to eat meat twice a day, maybe three times. Yeah, they might even get that roof fixed. Oh, contemplate the poetic justice of it, Nicholas. It's almost as if that crook Henry was donating a new roof to the church. [both laugh] That'd be a great joke on that crook Henry. It's a deal then, you'll do it, huh? Uh, I don't know. I still feel as though it'd be taking advantage of our friends. Aw, a fine friend you'd be if you deprive them of their meat. And a new roof. You sure they won't get hurt? They can only be helped. Wait a minute, Charlie. How do we get these diamonds back after we make the shipment? I got that all figured out too. Come on, let's start stuffing holy breads. ## Brother, uh, this shipment here, all these crates, don't send out until five days before Easter, understand? Yes, I understand. Just a minute. That's better. Just so there won't be any mistake. I want you to write a sign for me in Egyptian. Write this: "These two crates not to go out until five days before Easter." So what you write? What do you think, she's a dummy? She wrote what you told her to write. All right, I just want to make sure. I wrote, "This shipment not to go out until five days before Easter." Thank you very much, my dear. Goodbye, Nick. I don't like using her. Just asked her to write a few words. Get the picture, Nicholas. Those other crates go out every day. This shipment, five days before Easter it goes out and we go out with it. We end up in Ethiopia at the same time. Well, I got to hand it to you, Charlie, you got a lousy character but a good head. Just one thing. When is that money coming from Ethiopia? Nobody's been paid around here. He promised us he'd send all the dough, including our share, as soon as he gets the first shipment of breads. Come on, let's go bake breads. ## Nick! Nick! Nick! Nick, hurry, Charlie's come! I got it, Nick, I got it. A check for the entire sum including our profit, $5,500. It's about time. Miriam, go get the priest. Our boy in Ethiopia writes the breads are going like hotcakes. He wants us to double the order. He said that they're going so well now, come Easter time, he can sell twice as much at double the price. Ah, we're only gonna fill the order we got. My sentiments exactly. We'll bake breads until five days before Easter, then off to Ethiopia as planned. That's an awful big check to be handing over to such innocent people. Listen, you crumb bun, I still feel bad about what we've done. I'm gonna see if it makes me feel any better to give them the check. You wish to speak with me, Nicholas? Yes, Father, the money's finally come and it's all yours. Charlie here and me, we figure you ought to fix up the church and stock up on food. You might even buy a deep freeze. You're a bunch of nice people and we feel you shouldn't have to worry about cracks in the walls and the roof. Might even pay the workmen out of that. [priest speaking in Arabic] Father, what's Miriam doing over there? Oh, she's lighting a candle for you. She's lighting a candle for me? Yes, you're her angel. ## Look, baby, stop lighting candles for me. Why, Nick? I'm no angel. Nobody have I ever met who is as kind as you, nobody as good, nobody who wants to do as much for other people as you. Look, I'm gonna talk to you like a Dutch uncle. You got to learn the facts of life. Yes, Nick? First of all, there are a lot of guys out there who seem good on the outside, but they're really bums on the inside. But I do not understand. Well, you just can't trust people on appearances. You got to be careful they're not out to steal your wallet. Wallet? I do not have a wallet. Aw, that's just a figure of speech. In case if you ever leave your friends here, I want you to be able to take care of yourself. You know, there are a lot of guys out there who are like me on the outside and they're not so good on the inside and they may take advantage of you. What you say is very true. I have heard of such people. For all you know, I may be one. No, Nick, you're too good, too pure. Father, will you tell Miriam I'm not as good as she thinks I am. How could I tell the child a lie? Come, Miriam. You're very funny, Nick. Well, Nick, that check we handed over ought to fix things up real nicely for your friends. How do you feel about things now? Great, I feel just great. Is it true that Charlie is going to purchase tickets for your departure? You're leaving soon then? Yes. [bells chiming] Where is everybody? It's the first time I ever saw the streets so deserted. Hey, look, the shops are closed. Something must be wrong. That's why the bells are pounding like that. Hey, wait a minute. Not so fast. Hey! [bells continue] ## What's going on? [speaks Arabic] What'd he say? What's going on? [speaking Arabic] Hey, look, there's someone we know. Hey, brother, what's going on today? It's Easter. Easter? Oh, they sure believe in celebrating early. Yeah, yeah, that's what it's got to be. It must be that. Miriam, Miriam, look, what's this festival today? The festival of Easter. Easter? When is Easter? Don't you feel well, Charlie? Easter is today. Hey, what's today? Easter, brother, can't you see the festival? But I was told it was the 25th of the month! Father, tell him Easter isn't until the 25th of the month. But, my son, it is today. Look, I got proof. Easter isn't until the 25th of April. No, my son, by our calendar Easter is today. You didn't send the shipment that was supposed to go out five days before Easter, did you? Yes, I did. [bells chiming] ## [chanting] [cymbals clanking] [chanting continues] This cable came for you last night. [bells chiming] "Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. "Cakes a great success. "Rumors circulating that they contain diamonds. "Great for business, send more. Prices going up." And so it is with great sorrow that the knowledge has come to us that our friends, Nicholas and Charles, will go away from our midst. They have been good and loyal friends and have done so much for us. And so it is fitting that we all eat breakfast with our holy bread in their honor. [bells chiming] [monks chanting] Tastes like poison to me. Tastes fine to me. ## [roars]
