Plus, my sister Dot is coming soon. I'm surprised to hear you're excited, especially since you haven't spoken in three years. Yeah, I still remember when she opened for Patti LaBelle. She was almost as good as Patti. What? Patti is scared of Dot's voice. That's why she started making all them pies, in case she needed something to fall back on. M'Dear, why haven't you spoken to Aunt Dot in over three years? Sweet baby, stay out of grown folk business. Listen... M'Dear and Aunt Dot are notorious for not speaking and then getting back together as if nothing ever happened. They're like New Edition. Got it. So, which one of them was Bobby Brown? Dot. She had that funny haircut and everything. Amelia... don't be cruel. That's my prerogative. Aunt Dot! Woo! Here I am! Naughty but nice. ?

Oh, and I'm so... hoarse. Uh, I'm on vocal rest. I just booked a gig with Smokey for New Years. No problem, I'll just ask the Huell Sisters to sing. No! No, you don't! You crazy! What's wrong with the Huell Sisters? Ooh, we can't stand them. They cheated us out of winning the city talent show in '64. Well, how'd they cheat? They pulled a fast one by switching our sweet tea with dandelion tea. I don't get it. - Dandelion tea is a natural laxative. - Mm-hmm. Tell me it kicked in before you got onstage. Ooh, I wish I could. Ooh, those folks had quite a show that night. - We doing the pageant, Jeb! - Oh, come on. Hey, you mentioned the Huell Sisters on purpose, huh? I don't know what you're talking about. Mommy, do you think Santa wants cookies or cake? I don't see any cake mix. He wants cookies, sweetie. Oh, Ami. Sweet, little, innocent Ami. I used to be gullible like you before I grew up. Hey, old man. I fixed your night light. Ooh! Didn't Santa give that to you last Christmas? Yeah, Santa gave it to me. - Are you saying Santa's not real? - No. He is not saying that. Come on! We all know Santa isn't the one who's buying all those gifts. I know! His magical elves make the gifts. If you keep this up, you're not getting any gifts. Ami, Santa is as real as the hair on your mother's head. Her lashes. Her desire to kill me right now. I thought so. Mazzi's a liar and wrong. - You'll believe anything. - I will not! Did you know that Jade flew home from school yesterday? Ooh, Jade, can you teach me how to fly? Kids. Hey, Grandpa, need any help? As a matter of fact, I do. We weren't really asking. We were just trying to be polite. Get your narrow behinds over here and help me get these groceries to the shelter. Wait a minute. Wasn't that sweater in the giveaway pile? Oh, yeah. I almost forgot how cute it looked on me. It's for the homeless. But it has my name on it. Nobody's gonna want to wear this, unless their name is Jade. When it's 30 degrees outside and you're homeless, fashion goes out the window. How can you be homeless and have a window? Mm. Hey, hey, hey! Did you just throw a perfectly good apple away? I bit it. It was far from perfect. You two are wasteful. You only care about yourselves. You don't know what it's like to go without. That's where you're wrong, Grandpa. I know the struggle. You know, my hair diffuser broke, and it took two weeks for a new one to arrive from Japan. Two weeks. That's it. I want to teach you two a lesson. You're going to spend the night in the backyard roughing it. Whoa. - What do you mean "roughing it"? - What do you mean "you two"? ?

Mmm. I beg your pardon? My voice is on point. And that point is piercing my eardrums. Oh! Let me stop playing with Amelia before her sensitive butt stops talking to me... again! I am not sensitive, and when I stop talking to you, it's for a good reason. Oh, I don't know about that. I remember when you stopped talking to her for two years 'cause she borrowed your pearl earrings. She stole my earrings. - I borrowed them. - Stole. - Borrowed. - Stole. Did you ask me to wear them? - I... - Stole 'em. Okay, okay. Oh, remember the time you... what, stopped speaking to me for about a year-and-a-half because I used some brochure to kill a fly. That was not a brochure. That was Ernestine Brown's funeral program. Girl, you didn't even like Ernestine. But I loved her program! She looked like a young Cicely Tyson. After all those cigarettes, she looked like an old Mike Tyson. Ouch. Oh, well, uh, what about that time, what, about-- about three years ago, you stopped speaking to me over some funky bingo card. It was not just a bingo card, it was my bingo card, and you won ten big ones with it. Whoa, whoa, nobody told me that. Girl, you won $10,000 off Amelia's bingo card? No, ten dollars. Y'all stopped talking over ten dollars? Of course not. That would be petty. I stopped talking to her 'cause she wouldn't give me the two dollars I paid for the card. Ahh! When you say it out loud, it does seem kind of silly. Even if you whisper it, it's still silly. You guys have got to do better. Oh, yeah, you right. Oh, you know what? Hey, Amelia. For the record, here. Oh, no, I couldn't. Yeah, take it. - No. - Yes. - No! - Yes! - No more-- - I'll take it. I'm sick of being in the middle of you two my whole life. I'll tell you what, I want to be buried way across the cemetery so I can finally get some rest. Fine, we'll put you with your ex-husbands. Ooh, well, now, should we put her between Curly and Larry, or Larry and Moe? That's just mean. I prefer Curly and Moe. Soitenly! Mazzi really wants that Meganoid-3000 robot, but it's sold out everywhere. Oh! Relax, Cocoa. Our little surprise is here. This will totally convince him. Yo! You guys order a Santa? What is he waiting for? I don't-- I-I don't know. Uh, is-- is everything okay, Santa? I'm stuck! He's not Santa. - See, I told you he wasn't real. - You're a fraud! I'm really proud of us. I know, right? We slayed the roughing it game. What's all this? Our tent. We roughed it out here last night, just like you said. Our waffles are ready. You kids have clearly misunderstood the spirit of this exercise. Do you really think homeless people have all these luxuries? Well, you can't be sure that they don't. Well, I can. You can keep this tent, but everything else goes back in the house. Wait, everything? Everything, except you two. You're gonna stay out here another night. But it'll be really hard to stay out here without all of our stuff. Oh. Now you're getting it. Oh, oh, we need that. You're homeless. Get creative. That's just nasty. ? Hoo, ooh, ooh ♪ ♪ Hoo ♪ ♪ Hoo, ooh, ooh ♪ ♪ Hoo ♪ ♪ Hoo, ooh, ooh ♪ ♪ Hoo ♪ Wow. Were you guys this good back in the day? Oh, girl. We were more supreme than the Supremes. More marvelous than the Marvelettes. - Spicier than the Spice Girls. - Hello! Ah... So, what happened? - Hmm. - Yeah, Dot, tell her what happened. We were invited to open for Smokey Robinson. We, as in a group. Uh, go ahead. Well, um, Amelia and Maybelle, well, they... they were busy, so... And I went at it alone. And from that, I was offered a solo contract. I saw an opportunity and I took it. You took it 'cause you're selfish. Just because I looked out for myself, it doesn't make me selfish. That's kind of the definition. Well, what was I supposed to do? Amelia, she was pregnant, she was on bed rest, and Maybelle, well, she was already on her second marriage. I was not! Oh, okay. Yes, I was. Well, it's a shame, but groups break up all of the time. Exactly. Sure, feelings, they hurt at first... but, um, it's been... 40 years. Let it go. We were not just a group. We were sisters. If anybody wanted to fight either one of us, they had to fight all of us. We didn't just have each other's backs, we had each other's hearts. Sissy... I know that-- You abandoned us! And I told you then that I would never forget it. Oh. Oh... Oh, my, I didn't realize that you both still felt this way. I really... I'm sorry. You know what? I have gotten over this. I mean, we were young, we were feeling ourself... - It's okay, Dot. - It is not okay! It never was. And it never will be. What are you trying to say, Amelia? This Fabulous Williams Sisters reunion is canceled... and I'm not speaking to you. Wow. I didn't even feel this bad when Destiny's Child broke up. Huh. Well, that was it. I was the Beyoncé of our group, and just like her, there are people still hatin' on me for moving on. Get real, Dot. I was the Beyoncé of the group. Everybody knows that I was the Beyoncé if there ever was one! Uh... I thought you wasn't speaking to me. I was talking to them. I can't believe you did that to your sister... sister. It's so cold. I can't feel my toes! I can't feel my toes! That's because you're feeling my toes. Oh! My bad. I'm hungry. Going four hours without eating does strange things to a man. Ugh. Yeah. I'm going on the record. Being homeless sucks. Is that a girl going through our trash? Hi. I'm sorry. Is this your turf? Tonight it is. Oh, n-no. You can-- you can keep those. You sure? This is at least three dollars worth of bottles. Yeah. You two must be new to the streets. How can you tell? Because your head's not covered. You lose most of your body heat from your head. So if you don't have a hat, keep a blanket over it. Give me a shoe. This will keep your feet warm. Thanks. I'm Jade McKellan and that's my brother, Shaka. Hi, I'm Crystal Cooper. Are you all alone out here? Where are your parents? My mom and little sister are at the shelter. - Jade, let's go stay there. - Oh, it's full now. If you get in line really early, you can sometimes score a bed. Why don't they have room for everyone? I guess there's just too many people who need help. Make sure you guys stick together. You can wash up at the gas station on King Boulevard. They're pretty nice. Christmas is the best time of the year to go through people's trash. People are always throwing out their old stuff to make room for their new stuff. Look... a perfectly good apple. People are so wasteful. Yeah. They are. My hands are freezing. I got a hack for that. Put them in your pockets. Right. Take these. Oh, no, I-I can't. Then you'll be cold. It's okay. I've got a spot inside tonight. You need them more than me. Thanks. According to their website, there are five Meganoid-3000s in there, and one of them is going home with us. Yes! Ooh! I sure hope I can get one for my great-grandson. Aww. You're cute. She doesn't stand a chance. Nope! All right, here is the plan. - This is the toy section. - Okay. When the doors open, you run and block for me. While you hold everyone off, I'll grab a Meganoid-3000 and meet you at checkout. Love it. Sixteen years in the NFL about to pay off in a big way! Ready? Oh! No! Wait, wait! No! Moz! Wait! Moz! Wait! Oh, oh, oh! No! Not-- Not his head! Not his head! Ah! Ah! - Programs? - Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. Hey! Merry Christmas. - Merry Christmas. - Merry Christ... mas. Do you still think about what could have been if you ladies hadn't broken up? Sometimes. We could have been rich and famous. Definitely. But if you were rich and famous, you wouldn't have this family. I'd just replace them with a bunch of housekeepers. Oh! Come on, M'Dear. You couldn't have gone on tour, you were pregnant with Moz, and you probably wouldn't have had Daniel and Grace. Oh, you can't say that for sure. You're right. You're not the first person to wonder, "What if?" But... if you think about it... is what you missed better than what you have? Cocoa. My dear, sweet Cocoa, come here. Yes? You need a mint. Take it. Here you go. Yeah. Merry Christmas. Okay, back together for this Christmas only, the Fabulous... Williams Sisters! It's just me. Oh, Lord. Correction. The Fabulous Williams Sister. Thank you. Um... Stop the music. Happy holidays, saints. Happy holidays. Oh. Um... I'd like to talk to you a bit about life. I don't have a good one. I have a great one. And even with all of my many, many blessings, sometimes I still feel like I really didn't get what I wanted. And I've always blamed my sister Dot for that. - Here we go again. - Mmm. But instead of blaming her, I should be thanking her, because when I look out and I see my husband, my children, my grandbabies... I am just so grateful... for what is. Aww. Uh... Amelia... Well, does this mean you... you'll finally forgive me? If you'll forgive me. - Oh! Amelia! - Aww. Sisters! Oh, Maybelle! Now let's give the people what they came here to see, the Fabulous Williams Sisters! Now? - I'm really in no shape to sing. - Me neither. Well, okay. We do have the Huell Sisters in the house. Sit down! I would like to dedicate this song to my daughter-in-law, Cocoa. You may not look like it, but you are one smart cookie. Hit it, fellas! ?

Did you find her? Her family can stay in my room, it's snowing. I called both homeless shelters. No Crystal, no Coopers registered there in the past month. That's so weird. I really wanted to help her the way she helped us. Well, until we find her, we'll just have to find a way to pay it forward. Grandpa, I've got a bunch of clothes I want to donate. And I've got lots of toys. Amen. Amen. Mazzi's gonna be devastated when he realizes he didn't get that Meganoid-3000. Yeah, you're right. You tell him. We'll both break it to him. All right. Who left all these lights on? I was the last one out. They were off when I closed the door. Well, who built the fire then? Well, we were all at church. Did somebody break in? Whoever it was ate all of our cookies. Look! Look at all the toys! The real Santa came! I got it! I got it! I got my Meganoid-3000! I got it! Did you guys... - No. - No. - Honestly, it wasn't us. - Did you guys? I don't even know what that thing is. You guys were right. Santa is real. I hope he left me some batteries! Oh! Aw.
