VORT The Necrelian. They're here. VORT (OS) They're here. DURETUS (VO) Cursed Necrelian scourge. DURETUS Tell him to leave me alone or I'll... WAR VO: You'll what human? WISDOM VO: The fighting between us has passed. DURETUS And we nearly won. WISDOM VO:(To WAR) We all agreed to appoint them as guardians in our absence. WAR VO: I don't trust them. VORT Then trust me. I swore an oath of allegiance to protect your kingdom until the time you return. VORT speaks the true word. Son's of Eve lie, they're notorious for it. I took the oath as well, my word is my bond. The words of our agreement are carved on the amulets. Their power is sacred, do not abuse it. I'll make sure they are followed to the letter. I hope so. Now do the thing which we agreed upon. Surely there must be another way. Coward! You knew the weight of our sacrifice. When we made the agreement I didn't think we'd lose in battle. Are you ready? We are. Druisk, rest in peace. Guard the secrets well sons of Eve. VO: A great magic is time and its power to regulate the course of the planets. Only these forces can break the spell cast by a dragoon. And free Duretus. TOURIST GUIDE Across the square there you can see the Queen’s hotel which was built around 1900. The building behind you is the VOLDRAX building, believed to be the oldest in the city. It was built by King DRUISK in the year zero of our modern day calendar. As you can see the building itself has had a radical revamp with a modern exterior, although the original dungeons have been maintained along with a few other unique facilities... Are there any questions? Right. Around the corner is the town hall. If you would like to follow me we’ll move round that way. Alfie, Alfie. Good morning Mr Franklyn. Busy today? The grapevine tells me your presence has been requested from our "masters on high". Me? I wouldn't want to steal anybodies thunder now Mr Franklyn. Thanks for the warning. Mrs Jessop, Mr Steinbridge. Some of us have been with this company for thirty five years and never been higher then the third floor. It's a glass ceiling isn't it Mrs Jessop. I mean what ever happened to loyalty? All those wasted years hosting mindless cocktail parties for what? One would expect the chance to at least meet the senior partners. No ones ever met them. I was hoping to be the first... We'll walk. We'll take the other stairway TROY old mate. Fi, what on earth is going on?! I can't say! I think Steinbridge and Jessop have just had a go at me. They're just jealous. Of what? You're going up and they're staying where they are. You're more cryptic than Alfred. Everything comes to him who waits. ROLSTON Do you know who I am? Brandon Rolston. (VO) Don't be afraid to call me "mister" Rolston. Bezzencote Shocked Franklyn? Looking for a tattoo are we? Sorry to disappoint you but I don't have one. But I do have Roller and I do have a Ferrari and I have a penthouse and I have you! And you can call me sir! What the hell are you playing at Franklyn? Have you seen the state of his jacket? What's wrong with my jacket? There's fluff on it man, there's fluff on it! You're worried about my piece of fluff? You represent us to the outside world, if clients saw you covered in fluff we'd loose business. Sorry, perhaps I should have worn a vest... (VO) Rolston: Now you've torn it. Troy: I apologise. I didn't mean to say that. Yes you did. (VO) Rolston Stand up. No. Sit down. He's passed the test. That was a test?! We've had people in this office Franklyn with forty years experience on you reduced down to jibbering idiots. Reduced them to tears. Do you get some kind of pleasure out of this? I hate sycophants. If I want my backside wiped, I'll use toilet paper. I've seen more brown noses come and go from this company than you've had hot dinners. At least you stood up for yourself (VO) Rolston We've got a job for you. Ah, this is why I'm getting all the sharp looks from the senior auditors. We need someone who can think for themselves but follow orders. So you picked me. Correct. We've been monitoring your progress since you handled the Donovan account. We're dining at my place tonight. Dress casual. No need to wear a tie and restrict the blood flow. (VO) Rolston Four for eight That's a dossier on Duretus. And that's a parcel he wants delivered from the company vaults. Get up to speed on the contents by tonight, because the job starts tomorrow. The mans a multi-millionaire but he chooses to live here. Are you sure this is the right address? 90 Spencer Place. That's got to be Rolston's motor. Must be it! RADIO: We are of course talking about dragons... [Meat sizzling] Ah. They're here then. Good evening Mr Bezzencote. Ah, so this is your girlie then. This is Fiona Seamoore. Hello. She's from the legal department. Well remember anything you hear tonight is not to be discussed outside of this room. Complete discretion sir. Oh, and I'd rather you didn't call me "girlie". That's sorted then! I'm sitting next to the 'woman', Bezzencote is on the other side. That's good. Places then. Wine? Yes. I bought a nice Chardonnay. I know you did. We'll drink it when you've gone. Oh Thunderbolt! My Darren drinks that when he goes to his college parties. It's very... inexpensive. Great place you've got here Mr Bezzencote. Don't spoil it Franklyn. We both know it's a dump. Used to be a lot of rats here, but now most of them have moved up-market. Why live here when you could live anywhere you want? It's because I have everything I want that I want this. I like it. It's me. At the end of the day when I've been faffing about with the big wigs and high rollers of this world I can come back here and relax. What about the penthouse? Ah, weekends are another story. RADIO: actually we prefer the term cryptomorph... Did you read the document Franklyn? It was fascinating. Get on with it then. Excuse me? We want to hear your summary! Duretus, Rolston and Bezzencote are the sole accountants for the Brackenbridge estate in Yorkshire. Gustavas Duretus is the senior founding member and third partner in Duretus Rolston and Bezzencote, he also has the title of Lord Duretus of Brackenbridge. Come on Franklyn. Tell us something we don't know. Recently substantial funds from the company's bank account have been deposited directly into the Brackenbridge estate to pay for its up-keep As controlling member, Lord Duretus can do this. The transactions never show up on official bank statements. All slightly irregular. Lord Duretus has recently taken on a new personal Assistant, a Manfred Hunt, Ex-army officer and mercenary. He's been connected to a number of military coups in politically sensitive countries. Hunt has set up office for them in the old Voldrax building. There was no other profile information on him. Based on this evidence I'd say Lord DURETUS is dissolving your partnership. I thought as much. He's up to something. Well if he's going to shut the company down and misappropriate funds, wouldn't this be a police matter? If our clients knew that the police we investigating the senior partner, what do think it would do to our image? He's up to something. Sure as eggs is eggs! I see. Discretion is the order of the day. And that's where you come in. Mr Franklyn we've been expecting you. Made it just! Perfect. You've brought the package. Lord Duretus can't stand using couriers. You must be... eh...? Sorry. I'm Hunt. Manfred Hunt. PA to Lord Duretus. Pleased to meet you. VO: Quite a serious building you have here. Yes! My package has arrived. Troy: (VO) Is Lord Duretus available? Manfred: (VO) He's away on business but he should be back tomorrow. Thanks very much for the wonderful meal. I hope I didn't put you to any trouble. Not at all. You certainly enjoyed the game pie. You'll find that as a guest of Lord Duretus nothing is too much trouble. But you're tired. Bathroom is through that door. Should you need anything else just ring the bell. Just at the side of the bed. I'll see you in the morning. Mr Franklyn, pleasant dreams. Goodnight. Fiona hello matey Are you at Brackenbridge? This is the weirdest place I've ever been. What's going on? Let's just say nothing appears as it should be. I'll give you the low down when I'm back in the office. Oh you'll have to save it. I'm working from home today I've been given the Benifield account to handle. Anything I can do from this end? Yeah. Get onto the county architect and send me a copy of the Voldrax building blueprints please. I think there is a lot more to that building than meets the eye. Fiona: Over your head a bit? Ask me no questions and I'll tell you no lies. Fiona: (VO) Fair enough, see you. Cheers. I could have sworn that door was open. Spartacus: (VO) Its him, the auditor. Anyone here? Hello! Why do I get myself into this!? I can see you! Shouldn't you be in school? I know you're there. No you don't! Where did you spring from? Same place you did. Is he one of daddy's friends? I doubt it. He looks normal. I'm not normal... I mean of course I'm normal. Where are your parents? Why do you ask so many questions? Because I like lots of answers. We'll take you to your dad. Come on silly. Ophelia: How come its always me that has to carry the coats?! Spartacus: I said so. That must be your dad! Aristotle: Why aren't you two in school? Ophelia: We hate it there. Aristotle: Get down! Your pheromones will corrupt my readings. No disrespect kids, but your dad is a nut-bag. You probably think this looks a bit odd Mr Franklyn. But I can assure you my methods are scientifically correct. How do you know my name? Aristotle: You'll be the death of me you two. But we don't learn anything at school. Well of course you do. Spartacus, you should know better than to bring your sister out here. Me! I was the one who saw her sneak out first. Ophelia. Before you read the riot act, I'd like a few answers. Do you mind, I'm speaking to my children. You do realise this is a private park... and keeping your children truant from school... [proximity alarm sounds] Scanner: Scanning mode active Got something dad? Only the best reading since summer '93 Ah, Mr Franklyn if you wouldn't mind. Come on kids. What's going on? Ssshhh. We're getting closer. Down. Are you real!? I'm Aristotle Wood. You've met the gang. You're named Aristotle... and you've called your kids Spartacus and Ophelia! Great names yeah. You know my work isn't dissimilar from yours. Oh really! You're an auditor. We both have our methods for capturing data. You hacked into our computer and read my files. I prefer the term "cracked" hackers only exist in the tabloid papers. You know, you should get better security. That's beside the point. What are you doing here? Can't you guess? No. I can't. Go on. He called you a nut-bag. Thank you. That's good. Running me down before my own children. Typical suit! You really don't have any idea what you're involved in do you? It shows! This estate is surrounded by remnants of a quasi-static field. I'm not sure how it works, probably some form of Casualty Violation. Casualty Violation? Spartacus (VO) Time displacement theory. To cut a long story short, I've located a point source emanating from the Voldrax building, the one owned by Duretus. I've just ordered those blueprints for that place. Hang about this is starting to sound like Doctor Who. Oh please! Well you're not making much sense. We need to find the keeper. The Keeper of the Necrelian. Come in planet Earth. Troy (VO) What a surprise, a treasure map. Look, if you're not going to take this seriously. Well what do you expect!? I'll show you. Ever seen anything like this before? Doesn't mean anything to me. Hang on that's our URL! If your company insists on keeping all its documents on computer, its going to be easier to run off a copy. It's a copy of the Kingdom book! Every shire had one as a record of their status. I'm convinced this guy (Duretus) is one of the partners in your company. Oh come on... Let me finish. From what I've deciphered, druids called this "The Fire of Life." I think Duretus was released from it and Vort Igen the Keeper is still trapped inside. We need to find this guy, He's the missing link to conclusive proof of cryptomorph organisms. I find that hard to believe. May I ask what you're doing out here Mr Franklyn? Who are you? I'm Mr Kinnear the warden. May I ask what you're doing out here Mr Franklyn? Analyzing things! Like what? Its very scientific. By the way, do you normal creep up on people? This is private property sir. I didn't know this area was out of bounds. These your friends? The is my assistant and his children. Well, I think we're just about finished here. I want those samples analyzed as soon a possible Mister Wood. I" run a test straightaway. Has Lord Duretus returned yet? Lord Duretus I'm afraid has been detained. I have accommodation in the area Mr Franklyn I'd be honored if you stayed with us while we carried out our tests. It's a done deal. I'll be back tomorrow. Right then sir. I'll walk back with you. There are all sorts of 'things' around here. [Wisdom dragon spirit laughs] Did we glean any information on our friend Mr Franklyn? Well nothing terribly useful Tell me Manfred... Have you ever been boiled in molten lead!? No sir. Ah! Excellency. We've got to be careful. I could lose everything. You really mustn't worry excellency. Worry! You tell me not to worry! It could slip through my fingers. Didn't Necrl, crrrlll... Necrelian. They are called Necrelian. Surely you knew they would be back to replace you eventually? What, are you telling me I am some form of part time caretaker! I should be kinged. I should be King What about Wisdom and the other one? Two old dragons. They're easily removed. From what you've told me I think they'd be impervious to modern weapons. There are other solutions. A dragon Catcher. You can get a dragon catcher? The art has almost died out, but I know of one practitioner. Summon the dragon catcher. I want my Kingdom. Will the dragon eat me daddy? Course not baby! You know those stories are just old wives tales. You're not scared are you? I'm not scared. Anyway only the warrior dragons eat human flesh. Thanks a lot son. Not another word. Don't worry there's no warrior dragon here, and anyway I'll always protect you. Goodnight. Goodnight son. Goodnight dad. I want you to recite the cosine rule one hundred times, and you're both going to school tomorrow. Spartacus/Ophelia: No we're not! We hate it. The teacher is pooey! [Aristotle sings loudly to block out their protests] BED! Troy (VO): Nite, nite kids. Ophelia (VO): We're not kids, we're children! "we're not kids, we're children" Troy (VO): They're a real couple of characters. I hope so. I want my children to grow up to be somebody. You know, stand up for themselves. I think it's time that you and I to had a long chat. Why not. Troy (VO): That's a pretty amazing history you've got. Which bit did you find amazing? The bit were my wife left me for another man, or learning that a grown man believes in cryptomorphs? Why not just call them goblins or dragons, I know you're dying too. I'll stick to cryptomorphs until I learn otherwise. Why didn't your wife take Spartacus and Ophelia? (Laughs) Jenny! She's as selfish as they come. I think the children were a hindrance for her. Besides, I wanted them. You're lifestyle isn't very... Stable? You mean I should be like the masses and tow the line? My children never go short, they're bright and you won't find a parent who loves his kids more than me. You've got me! Each to his own I suppose. Look, I don't expect you to believe me. Alright, for the sake of argument I'll go along with your theories. How do we find this keeper? Well, lets start here. The basement. Nervous Manfred? Its just this place excellency. Is there something you wanted to show me? Lead on. I have a little surprise for you. In here? Who's there? So you're awake. Release me liar! Harsh words. Doesn't your accommodation suit you friend? I would never count a traitor amongst my friends. See how ungrateful some people are. What a disgusting little man. I have excellent news for you Keeper. What, you're going to impale yourself on a broadsword? Oh, very droll. I'm going to release the legion, to take back the Kingdom. The who? I've kept these hidden for a very long time. Duretus: Behold. Manfred: You were like one of these?! Duretus: Entombed. Like an insect in amber. Precisely frozen in time. A legion of hand-picked warriors. Your own personal army. Vort: They're duty is to protect the sovereignty of Ironbrawn until the dragons return to breed. But I intend to ride them across Britain to claim the kingdom as my own. How will you do that? I already have two of the amulets, now you have given me the third and soon my friend, I will have the fourth. It makes sense on Duretus' part to stash the Keeper out of sight. We should be able to pick him up by his latent field traces. Seeing is believing. It must be hard for you. What do you mean? Locked in your little accountancy world of numbers. Spare me the lectures. Your life isn't so perfect dad. I had two scanners in here. Don't tell me you've left them at home. I've got it. Does it work through walls? It can detect a mouse wearing slippers through three inch steel. I was looking at these. See these doorways? They're all dead ends. Uh ah. I don't think so. I think they all lead into a larger chamber which has been rubbed out. Very good. Come on. Well, that's it then. Wimp! Have you heard of breaking and entry! To make an omelet you have to break a few eggs. Don't you want to find out what Duretus is up to? You know it makes sense. I'd rather keep my job. We'll come back tonight. It'll be easier to get in. Alright... Excellency permit me to present..ugh I am Mademoiselle Celine. You requested my services. Duretus: I don't make requests, I issue orders. As you like it monsieur. She is the dragon catcher. Oui, that is my profession... ah wine! Please more. Were you invited to sit down?! Who is this? Leave her Manfred. Do you clean his truss? Madam! Excuse me monsieur! Excuse. Je suis mademoiselle. Try to remember please. You make me sound old and crotchety. You don't look like a dragon catcher. They can be quite viscous when provoked. I can be the same. Isn't she deliciously vulgar? I can be vulgar as well. Why should I employ you? Because you have a problem, and I can remove... that problem. What do you want in return? Nothing. Manfred: Nothing? Everybody wants something. True. But killing the dragons will give me satisfaction. Of course, there is the question of economics. I will charge you one million English pounds. A million pounds! I'll double it. If you bring me the amulet worn by the warrior dragon. My methods are unconventional. I don't care. Just do it. Excellency! [Celine belches] What is the highest part of this town? It's the car park in the center, it's thirteen floors and you can see the whole city from there. Bon. I will start working tonight. But I must leave now. You won't let me down - will you? I must have my beauty sleep if I am to be at my best. So please, I must leave you now. Idiot! A million pounds! Excellency! But two million pounds! It'll be worth every penny if she does what I want. "If" So now what? This way. The number seven. Don't you ever say please? Would you prefer me to beat you up, or say please? I'm sorry mama. You are not my son you ugly pig. The dragons took my baby. Well I'm still waiting for the number seven! Here. Can you see anything? Celine (VO): Silence idiot. Let me focus. I see one! Write this down. Genus draco minimax. Species avaritisa. What's it doing? Shut up imbecile. Second dragon. Draco Minimax... Species... Simplex?! Two species in the same area. This is unprecedented! You know what this means... this is a sanctuary. Aristotle: Did you have to hit it quiet so hard? We got in. I can put it back so you wouldn't know the difference. Come on. Can't you turn that thing down? The signals buried the needle. We're right on top of something. I just hope its not the Warden again. I took a reading off him. He's been near a Cryptomorph alright. We'll see. You're really into this now. Vort: Who's there? Come back to gloat? Come into the light where I can see you. Don't panic. My name is Troy. Troy Franklyn. Are you the Keeper? You know my name? Blimey. It's true. Yes! [Coughs] Why does my predicament make you so happy?! Why are you chained? The General did this to me. Duretus... He released me from the crystal, now his heart is fueled by greed. We must stop him. I'm Aristotle. What's he going to do? Unspeakable horrors. Nice and easy. What time am I in? Quarter past nine. No, I think he means year. The year is one thousand nine hundred and ninety nine anno domini. I've been asleep for two thousand years... That's you isn't it? The Kingdom book, how did you come by this? Tell me. Aristotle: I downloaded a file. Troy: We can take you there. Ah, yes. The circle closes. The Necrelian will soon return. I must prepare the way. Describe the Necrelian to me. This is deep. Now I have three amulets. I tried to stop her. Do we not understand the principal of knocking? Are you hiding something in here? Of course not. So why must I always knock! You are too reticent. Shall I remove her sir? [Celine roars] What is the purpose of your visit? I have spent all night observing from a place of great height and I have identified five separate species of dragon. Five! For simplicity I call them by their human names; War. Wisdom Greed. Naivety. Vanity When three or more species of dragon are seen in the same area, it becomes a sanctuary. It's natures law. Duretus: So? So means, they will breed here. What is the name of their blood line? Necrelian. J'etre au courant de ce qui se passe. (I like to be informed what's going on). Madame, please, please, please English. Necrelian... They are the worst. Gaston. Gaston my baby. What is the matter? He is here. War of Necrelian. He took my baby. I am convinced it was this dragon who robbed me. I thought they stopped doing that. Then make me a liar. I found this in the wall outside my baby's nursery. Dragons never shed their claws. So how do you know it belongs to War? Because I have hunted nearly every other living dragon and they all had their claws. You have killed all these dragons? Oui. And now I have found my baby's murderer. So what is your plan? One by one they will be mine. I hope Vort hasn't drowned himself in the shower. Jenny. Harry. Who's this? Hi. I'm Troy Franklyn. Is he another one of your weird friends? Not found the "Soup Dragon" yet? Hello Jenny... how are you? Everything is fine. Spartacus and Ophelia are brilliant just in case you forgot to ask about them. Don't play sarcasm with me Harry. You know you'll lose. You know I don't like you calling me Harry. Oh yes, that's right. You couldn't have a normal name, you have to be different. Oh come on. Are we back to that one again? Let me travel back in time and tell my parents to name me Philip or Anthony or whatever you think I should be called. That reminds me, how is "Mr Chocolate"? I wish you wouldn't call him that. You're in no position to throw stones. Look at you. Do you know why I call my ex-wife's boyfriend "Mr Chocolate"...? Because he could eat himself. "Peter Perfect!" You're on very thin ice Harry. ARISTOTLE! The name is Aristotle. Excuse me. You have guests. Aristotle/Jenny: Shut up. This is your woman? I am not anybodies woman! I bought you this sweatshirt. Why is he wearing it? His clothes were dirty so I let him have some of my stuff. Country casual suits you. I dressed to suit your modern convention. I'll just get the rest of my things and leave you. Two 'Beardy-Weirdys' in the house is enough for any sane woman. I'd like to say it was a pleasure meeting you but I won't. Likewise. Have a nice day Jenny. You deserve it. My wife had fire too. Do you wrestle with her? She'd beat me every time. Guys, time is moving on. Vort: What do you know about Duretus? Troy: He's hiding something at Brackenbridge estate. Your chariot has great speed. Its not a chariot, its a car. Try and relax, you're perfectly safe. Are you sure your friend couldn't come along? Aristotle? He's looking after the children. The kin of Necrelian will soon return to breed. They sound Dutch or something. No. They're dragons. You really believe this crap. You really believe cryptomorphs, sorry 'dragons' wondering round the countryside? Strass Necrelian is the collective name for their bloodline. I was the Keeper of their lair. You looked after them? Yes. In a manner of speaking. So what's the connection between these 'dragons' and Duretus. Brackenbridge is their last natural breeding ground. 2000 years ago there was a battle between us and the Dragons. They won. We vowed to protect their sacred ground until they returned. Duretus was appointed General to protect them with a Legion of Warriors. They await Duretus word. Be he's intent on destroying the dragons and claiming Britain for his own Kingdom. Why hasn't he done it already? Energy. He needs the energy source of the Khal'L harnessed within four bronze amulets to unleash the warriors. How big are these amulets? The package. Damn! I think I may have given him one for free. Be still within yourself my friend. What are you doing? I'm meditating. Its good for stress. Stress! How can you have stress without a brain? Come. Come idiot. Come. Oui mademoiselle. Selfish. She's so selfish. It's him. Can you make your own way from here? I'll be fine. Wish me luck. Travel swiftly. Lord Duretus. Troy Franklyn Ah, Franklyn. I thought you might drop by. [Tannoy: Welcome to the third annual Brackenbridge Estate open day...] I'm sorry. As you can see we've got the 'rubbish' in today. But I hope they didn't charge you full price at the gate. I take it you received your package? It's safe. I'm sorry we couldn't meet last night. Well, you know what it's like. Money makes the world go round. What a beautiful estate you have here. I'd love to see more of it. We'll have to see what can be arranged. It'll be much appreciated. Come. Bring your can. Exquisite. This is all very pleasant. Yes. I'm very proud of Brackenbridge. I sacrificed a lot to get here. Your share of Duretus, Rolston and Bezzencote. False accounting. Shall I go on? Let's not beat about the bush Franklyn. That package was more than your Rolodex wasn't it? Oh we are an inquisitive little man. I don't think your masters will be very pleased with your plans. So you know about the Necrelian. The dragons. Seeing is believing. Ooh. They're real alright. It isn't a question of money by any chance is it Franklyn? Hasn't anybody told you, You can't buy me. Oh dear! I think you've just priced yourself out of the market. We all know what happens to unwanted stock, don't we. I've got a job to do. I'm sure you can see yourself out. Yes! I'm sure I can. Don't touch anything will you. [Troy's mobile rings] Troy Franklyn. Troy, its Aristotle. I can't find me children. They gone walkabout again? Did you try the school? They didn't show up today. Oh great! Hang on a second. I've got someone here who'd like a word with you. Hi dad. Spartacus! Where are you both? Brackenbridge. Are you alright? Yes dad we're fine. How are you? You can't charm your way out of this one son of mine. I want you to stay with Troy until I get there. Is that understood? Yes dad. I'll pass you back to Troy. Bye. Don't worry I'll keep an eye on them. I'll drive down to the side gate. We'll meet you there. Okay, I'll meet you in one hour. Aristotle: Thanks for looking after them. Troy: No problem. Vort: I can't believe you brought children out here! Yeah, I'll change them to the bed next time. [Aristotle’s scanner begins beeping] I'm getting some good readings. Omni directional. Wow its going crazy. Why do you waste time with such a contraption? He's a scientist, don't ask. Look at that. Draco 97.21 Gigahertz. Dragon detected. So why don't we see anything? Wisdom. Make yourself known to us. I've waited all my life to see this and I think I'm going to... Vort: Duretus has evil at his heart. Wisdom: Choosing him was a mistake. Strange, your friend's jaw nearly touches the grass. He's never seen one of your type before. He has now. An actual... real... dragon! Its a shock human. You'll get used to it. Troy, meet Draco Minimax Sapiens. And this one is Aristotle. Hi... Draco Minimax Sapiens. That's your species name right? Most call me Wisdom. You humans are called Homo Sapiens, I'm Draco Sapiens. Does all your species exhibit deliberate epidermal pigment displacement or is it just a trait in females? You mean are we all chameleons? This is brilliant. I can actually ask you questions and get answers! Where do you come from? We roamed here thousands of years before sons of Eve had their first firelight. When your kind came, we made a pact with them to keep this land. But your incessant greed led to terrible wars between us. Now there are a mere handful of us spread around the five continents. We're forced to stay hidden and only emerge to breed once every two thousand years. In time this land was known as Ironbrawn. Then Brackenbridge. The true king will be chosen by the newborn dragon. I've got a million questions I want to ask both of you. But first we must have a plan. Should have listened to War. Duretus can't be trusted. Who's War? Draco Bellare, the warrior dragon. Yes. War will guard the egg of the next dragon in our bloodline. Duretus already has three of the amulets in his possession. The Legion? At his disposal. How many of your kind can we count on? You can count on me. I'm right behind you. Count me in too. You must gather the rest of your kin, It is time to hold council. This is real magic. Come to mama. Faster. Faster! Speed of thunder. More of everything. The speed of lightening! Now do your work. We need to find the dragon. Spartacus: Dad told us to stay here. Ophelia: Do you do everything you're told? Well. Have you finished making the pastry? Oui mademoiselle. So what are you waiting for huh? You really shouldn't be using these children as bait. In my opinion it's just not right. Oh you are such a stupid man. Why do you question my methods?! My money feeds you, no? Well. But even so... Oh the children are there. Hide yourself. Children - help! Did you hurt yourself? Oh no, I'm just a foolish old woman who has lost her knitting needle. What are your names? I'm Ophelia, this is my brother Spartacus. Such beautiful names. I am grand-mere Celine. You are such clever children. Will you help me to find my knitting needle? So I can finish the vest for my grandson. I can't see anything. [Grand-mere Celine cries] Oh no! I can't finish the vest for my grandson. And he will freeze in the cold. Don't cry grand-mere Celine. Have you got a spare needle? Oh yes. Of course. Of course I have a spare needle. Voila! Tick tock... Look at the needle. Tick tock. Tick tock. You will be like crunchy raisins in my pie for Mr dragon! Ophelia: I'll get my dad onto you. So what can he do? Nothing at all. Spartacus: Great, now we're really in trouble. Dad's going to go mad. Oh stop complaining you stupid children. Ismail, bring the pie so that we can put the children in. Ophelia: I want to be let out. Shut up mes enfants. Come dragon, come. This is a delicious pie. Where are you? Come! Look at this pie. Come to my restaurant. PIE. Pardon? I'm hungry. Monsieur Greed The menu. Just give me some pie. O' la. Pie Mr Greed. Look. Pppiiiieeeee! [Greed snores loudly] Well Mr Greed was your lunch acceptable? Full of pie, and trapped by his own greed. What irony. This is a special ring. When its like this it will drain your energy. Come! What do we do now then? They know we're here. Make a noise with your contraption. [Loud car horn] I should have got back to the kids ages ago. I can't believe time has passed so quickly. Vort: They're here. Are you wearing blue contact lenses? Ah, you noticed. Don't you think they make me look younger? How old are you? I'm as old as rock. Perhaps you should use wrinkle cream. I am Vort. Keeper of the Necrelian domain and I bring this council to order. Who will speak first? I've got an idea. What is it Naivety? Circus. You stupid moron. I'm not a moron. But you're ugly. Silence! Duretus holds all the cards. I agree. He has three amulets and The Legion of Warriors. His plans won't raise any outside attention until its too late. We need to turn the tables. That's the hard part. Everything else must center around the birth. We will confront Duretus after the birth of the new dragon. Ah. So you say you've caught the first dragon. It was easy. I can predict we shall have the others within forty eight hours. Well done. Carry on. Oui monsieur I will continue. Come. Come with me. You really shouldn't be doing this. What did you say!! This is their breeding ground. One day you'll do that to somebody and they'll strike back. Get out. Mr Naivety Come. Mr dragon Have you passed your flying proficiency test? Me fly good. Yes of course, but with a certificate of airworthiness from the Academy Aeronautic des Paris you could fly even better. Me good student. Me want air miles. Bon. You must complete a whole circuit around the city and come back here. Understand! Hmm. "La Marseille" anthem. Okay. I take off now. Bon voyage. Me fly good? Yes. Yes. You are flying very well. You are my best student. You certainly qualify as the most stupid one. Me still fly good? Looks like I won't be needing you my little friend. Still can't get a signal. I have no liking for your modern contraptions. The chariot, this squeaking thing. It's not waterproof. You ought to try life in the city... I'll take my chances out here. Give it a go. Why don't you... Spartacus and Ophelia have left the car. Not again. They really are trouble aren't they? Maybe they just hungry. I remember what children were like. What if Duretus has got them? It's not beyond him. We'd better split up. Watch out. Boy Girl. Where are you? You've come back to me. I look for boy and girl not woman. But it's me. Your long lost love Princess Celine. Huh!? Don't you remember me my handsome prince? Me! Handsome. You are so handsome and charming you have beautiful teeth. Only my true love could make my heart beat like this. Are you sure you don't remember me? Hmmm no. But do I have good cheek bones? You are the best looking dragon prince in the whole country. You're making me blush. Oh don't be shy. I've kept all your love poems you sent to me. Vanity: Is it all about me? Yes of course. I am nothing compared to you. Lavish me. I am the Sun, the Moon and all the stars in between. More scrumptious than ten chocolate bars. Sweeter than jelly between my toes. Lovely and cute from head to tail. I am so pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty and pretty and attractive and nice. What a talented poet I've become. P.S. You are nice too. You are charming, you are clever but you are witty as well Excuse. I have one request. Hmmm. You may ask me. Will you... marry me? Monsieur handsome dragon? Urgh. Very well. You are ugly, but I will marry you out of pity. [Vanity shrieks] Celine: Now you are mine! Still no sign of them. Aristotle... Think. Where else could they have gone? I've looked everywhere. Sometimes things turn up were you least expect them. We'll have to widen the search area. Wisdom... Wisdom told me the other dragons has disappeared. Ah, I think this is all becoming a bit too coincidental. Duretus? But why? Use the children as bait to lure the dragons. But their not flesh eaters... apart from the warrior... Oh no! If we stay rational we can find a way round this. What about my children? We'll find them. I promise. [War: ROARS] Quieten yourself! How can you tell me to keep silent? Can’t you see what they have done to our Kingdom? Do you think my heart isn't broken when I see this? You don't show it. Maybe you're resigned to failure already. You speak like a fool. [ROARS] Don’t bare your teeth to me warrior dragon. The others have been captured. I want to rescue them. No. No. No! You've let the humans blind you to our needs. Why are we looking for their children and not protecting ourselves? Reason with me. Whoever's captured the others, can hold you. I'm trained in battle; I'll stand a better chance. You'd be walking into a trap. That amulet around your neck is our last chance for survival. Think what you like. I've got to help them. Go on. Do what you have to. Don't say you weren't warned. I won't let you down. You must be the dragon catcher. (Laughing) Moi? Where are the rest of the dragons? Somewhere you will never find them. My friend. You betrayed me. A good soldier never lets his guard down. Give me the amulet. You have all your claws! You didn't take my baby Gaston! I don't prey on children or the defenseless. You're worthless to me. Then let me go. No. Non. The King wants your amulet and I will have your head. Come. What's wrong? War. He's been captured. Is this some kind of dragon telepathy thing? Do you think this is a game? Is it fun for you? We could all be killed. Fighting amongst ourselves won't help. I apologise. I sometimes don't take things seriously enough. I think its time we confronted Duretus on his home ground. Who's coming? Yeah, I've got a few questions I want to ask him myself. () It might be prudent for you to stay here. We'll continue searching for the children. Ismail: Wake up. Wake up. Will you wake up! What do you want? I've come to help. I don't need a humans help. You'd rather rot here? You can't do anything for me. Listen. I may not be in chains but mademoiselle Celine keeps me a prisoner. Make sense gimp. Don't call me that. Don't ever call me that. You're no better than her with your demands. I hate her just as much as you do. She took me from an orphanage. I realise now, I was happier there than I've ever been. At least I had friends. So what is this to do with me? Not only does she want your amulet, but she thinks a dragon killed her baby son. That's why she hunts you're kind. So, how can you help? Trust me. I used to split the chains on animals at mademoiselle's circus. I never hurt an animal then and I don't intend to start now. Excellency. Mr Franklyn and his assistant are outside. Our mister Franklyn is beginning to annoy me. Oh show him in. Where are my children Duretus. Who are you and what on Earth would I have to do with your grotty children. Go on, play the innocent. I've had about enough of you. I've only just begun. And what are you going to accuse me now?! Have you got a few spare hours? There's a lot of people who'd like to see you taken down a peg. You bore me Franklyn. Next time, bring a warrant and plenty of hard evidence. I'll be back for you. I can't wait. He's up to something I can feel it. We'll be ready for him. The dragons have been incapacitated. Only Wisdom remains free and she's powerless without the others. You've done a marvelous job. Manfred. Excellency. Prepare a check for three million pounds. Three million. A small bonus my dear. You are so generous. Perhaps I will visit your kingdom again. Duretus got rid of us too easily. But we don't have anything substantial on him. Imagine taking this to the police. Wait a minute... This place still has its original dungeons. I know I'm thinking what you're thinking. Let's do it! Soon. Aristotle: Daylight?! Before I cement my position as ruler over this Kingdom, I must remove all those who would dispute my throne. He's not is he? Shush. Duretus: Do you deny my rightful ascension to this throne? With every breath in my body son of Eve. Well that's too bad. Looks like we're going to have dragon soup tonight. This doesn't look good. I stand with the dragon. A traitor! Let him go. He's useless. I've witnessed the way you've treated these dragons. I want no part of your cruelty. Looks like you'll be on overtime tonight Manfred. Will you be killing them with your bare hands, or would you like a little help from above? Bare hands are just too easy. You know how much I enjoy new weaponry. These will give me the power I crave. My army shall march across the land and when it is finished the Kingdom shall be mine! The fourth amulet if you please. You'll have to take it off me. Nothing would give me greater pleasure. Manfred, fetch it. Warrior dragon. You smell like a chicken. [War growls] I bet you taste like chicken. I love chicken. I prefer barbecued rat! Now what have you done, you fool?! I told you. One day someone would fight back. Thank you. Lead the way. I'm right behind you. Steady, Wars not too keen on humans. Manowar belay that fire. Do you know him? We'll hear him out. I'm here to help. We're with Wisdom. And I want my children. Your children! They've been eaten. Eathen? EATEN!!! Did you eat them? I don't eat children... not enough meat [laughs] Don't look at me! No. It was Greed. Are you sure this is such a good idea? They'll be alright in there, don't you worry. A dragons digestive system is very slow, Besides... that fat fool has been over eating. Keep still. This is ridiculous, this. You're wasting your time. They're not in there. I've got something. [Greed burps] Urgh, boy you stink. I think he's going to vomit. We're free. I was scared daddy. You're alright. I can't believe it. You're intact. Spartacus, did you learn anything about the inner digestive system? Yeah, it stinks! Oh thank you Troy. What's for pudding? The spirit between Necrelian and mankind is now bonded in the heavens. Wisdom: An albino! Is that good? It's a sign of longevity. Looks like you've got yourself an admirer. The new born has chosen the successor to this kingdom. Do you accept? I accept. You've got a great place here. I hope it stays that way. With the amulets back in safe keeping, everything can go back to normal. You're going to be alright. Well, I should be getting back. There's room for you here. We've decided to settle in the area, I've booked Spartacus and Ophelia into a school. You know, give them a bit of "stability". Good for you. Plus I get the chance to study all I can. Troy: I'll visit. Will you? Perhaps this is how it should be. Will you look after things? The Kingdoms in safe hands. I'll make sure my company continues to pay the maintenance checks for the estate. You won't be disturbed. Goodbye auditor. Troy: Mad as a kite! Aristotle: Pen-pusher. Goodbye Troy. [Rolston on the phone] I'll get onto it right away Mr Rolston. Mad as a kite. Wisdom: Remember... some people keep the greatest secrets. [Naivety Laughs] Humans. You're not so bad after all!
