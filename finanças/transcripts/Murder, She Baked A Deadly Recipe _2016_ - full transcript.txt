[♪♪♪] [Door unlocks] [♪♪♪] [♪♪♪] [♪♪♪] [♪♪♪] [Starter hesitating to turn over] [Man]: Hey! Hey! Get away from my car. Get back here! I'm calling the cops! Hey, get back here! [Man dials phone] [Emergency operator]: 911 emergency. [Man]: Help. They're breaking into my car! [Operator]: Hold on, sir. Enjoy the cookies! Okay, bye! Oh! [Hannah]: Hey! Ow. [♪♪♪] [Sirens approaching] [Man]: Hey, are you okay? [Hannah]: Thank you. Yeah, I'm all right. Yes, officer, and that's when I yelled at him... Same M.O. He took off and ran right down here, and then... Follows the same pattern. No broken glass. These guys are quick, they're clean, and well-organized. Just like the others over at Redland. You've done your homework on this, that's for sure. I've been trying to get the sheriff to set up a bait car program, but he keeps banging on about there being no budget. You know what my best guess is? That he wants to take all the glory. Bingo. At least you're ahead in the polls, man. Yeah. I'm not going to win. A week before every election, he busts a big case, the press goes wild, and what do you know-- another one? Yeah. That's five in the last two weeks. No broken glass means they hacked the keyless system. All right, I'm putting Kingston on this one, Bill. He'll report directly to me. Hey, wait a minute, sheriff. I've been chasing this case for a month. This is my collar. Yeah, well, not anymore. [Mike]: News at 11. [Sheriff]: I got this. Miss winters! What brings you out here? My scanner. Of course. Sheriff, could you give us a statement? Yes. We've had... Like clockwork. What I'd tell you. [Winters interviews sheriff, faint, indistinct] Look... If I am point, you are still on this. [Interview continues, faint, indistinct] [Winters]: Three car thefts in one night. Are they connected? [Sheriff]: Connected and coordinated. No question in my mind, this is the work of professionals and organized thieves. [Winters]: Are you concerned with the drop in your polls' numbers? I can assure you as long as I'm sheriff, this or any crime will not go unpunished, not on my watch. Thank you, Sheriff. I'm putting a mint bar in here for your daughter, on the house. Linda, you know I am famous throughout the county for my butter tarts. It's been in my family for generations, Helen. Generations! That was my great-grandmother's recipe! It sounds like we haven't figured out whose recipe this is? We need a name for the cookbook. It's mine. No question. Linda Norton, don't you dare take credit for my recipe. It's mine! Isn't your son allergic to corn? 'Cause this has corn syrup in it. Oh, yes, he is. I dictated that recipe to you the spring I broke my wrist. That is the... Mystery solved! [Laughing] [Winters on newscast]: Sheriff Grant has asked that anyone with any information please call the sheriff's station. You really think the guy that bumped into you was a car thief? It all seems to fit. Speaking of bumps... What? Oh! She's going to get soaked! Andrea! You're getting my niece or nephew all wet. It's just water. It's fine. [Delores]: Hannah! I have been meaning to get you my Hawaiian prawn pot pie recipe for the cookbook. Oh, thank you... It's just been so crazy busy with the new store. You have no idea what it's like setting up a business. I think she knows the basics, mother. Now, what do you think is more electable, smiley Bill, or tough on crime Bill? Oh, uh, I vote for smiley Bill. Is that the same shrimp concoction you used to make for us every weekend? Oh, yes, your father loved it so much, and please don't call it a concoction, Andrea. It's a very unflattering way to refer to it, honey. It's going to be perfect for the cookbook, Hannah. Oh, yes, mother, but there is a whole committee, you know, and we have to test all the recipes. Oh, say no more, I understand. We must honor the formalities. Delores! Delivery needs your signature! Oh, I'll be right there, Paige! Well, duty calls again, girls. I'll talk to you later, ta-ta! Bye, mother. As my dear mother used to say, there's no rest for the weary! [Andrea]: You're not really going to put that in the cookbook, are you? My stomach is still traumatized. Well, that's what the committee is for. They'll vote, and we're covered. Ooh, devious! I love it. Nettie Grant, hello! Oh, hi! Hey! How are you and Sheriff Grant holding up? Tight race. We're great, thank you. Hannah, you cut your hair. - Yeah. - It's different. Thank you. And good luck to your husband in the election. Yeah! May the best man win. That's devious. That's politics. I like it. Yup! [Phone ringing] Hannah! Hannah, hello. Phone's for you. Really? Norman. Thank you very much. Say hello from me. I will, Mrs. Houser. Hi, Norman! [Norman]: Hey, you! So I am presently guzzling what has to be the world's worst cup of coffee, and, naturally, I thought of you. Thank you... I guess. I, I mean... I thought... Oh, thank you, honey. They're delicious. ...where would I get the world's best cup of coffee, which, of course, would be your shop. So I'm missing your face here in the morning. Is the big city dental conference thrilling? Yeah, nothing says excitement like "the story of posterior composites" seminar. How're things at the cookie jar? Hot. I mean, warm... 'Cause it's busy here and the heater's been busted, but, um... Lemon bar? I've been thinking a lot about you, you know? That's nice to hear, Norman, I... Just for one second. Hey! Hey, man, I miss you, too. How's the conference? It's going fine, Mike. Thanks for asking. Mike, just... yeah. I'm sorry, Norman. That's okay. Hannah's working another mystery, something about a car theft, so no need to hurry back, man. Norman, I'm taking you off speaker phone right now, and I apologize for Mike Kingston. No, it's okay. I'm sure his mother's been doing that for years. Right! I'm sure that's true. I do have to go, though, so I'll talk to you later, okay? You are impossible. You love it. Don't get ahead of yourself. You want something? Tell me about the message. You think the guy that knocked you over... Right! So I was at 3rd and main and was delivering cookies, and this guy, he smacked into me... I mean, running scared... And he dropped this. It has my fingerprints on it, but you have them on file. Yep, we sure do. Huh, that crest looks European, maybe. Good work. Thank you. Can I get you something? Yes, actually... At least a dozen cookies. I want some of those double chocolates. I'll take some of those chocolate chip right there. They look fantastic. Some pecan divines, some apple orchard bars, please... Sounds like you're getting everyone's favorites. Things are a little bit tense at the station with your brother-in-law running against the sheriff. Mm. Polls show you might be getting a new boss. I better make it two dozen. Yeah. Look, I'd like to get this into evidence as quick as possible. Can you deliver those? Yeah, yeah, I'll bring them by in a minute, okay? Okay, great. Great. So what are you doing later? You said double chocolates, right? You're being evasive. I'm being mysterious. That is very different. Heard you like a good mystery. I see, is that how it's going to be? Okay. Uh, I'm assuming that will cover it. Anything for you, detective? What? I'll see you in a bit. [Bill, yelling]: Election or not, this is my case. [Sheriff, also yelling]: No, it is not your case! I've already told you that. You are off! [Bill]: Read my notes. I've done the whole... [Sheriff]: I don't have to read your notes. You're not on it anymore. [Bill]: What, you're going to take me off my case? All of them? Take all my research and then say, "hey, look what I did, everybody!" [Sheriff]: Last time I checked, you hadn't cracked the case. [Bill]: Last time I checked, you hadn't even started. You know what? You are not sheriff yet. You're ahead in the polls, but the game isn't over, and I don't appreciate this tone! [Bill]: I know your M.O. A week before every election, you crack a big case, the press celebrates it... Hi, um, I just have a delivery? Ah, yeah. Janet. Admin. Great. [Argument continues, indistinct] [Woman]: We're having a hectic day here, Kevin. [Kevin]: I have to talk to the sheriff. This can't be put off. [Woman]: Everyone has an important reason. [Kevin]: But Lucy's recital is tonight. You'll be the first in when he's ready for you, Kevin. I can't miss this, okay? This is for my daughter! I understand. Hey, Kevin. Hannah! Come on in. Oh, hi, Janet. So Mike asked me to deliver some cookies, and I threw in a few extra pecan divines for your boyfriend... Brad. [Giggles] Thank you! That is so nice of you. Of course! When do we get to meet this Brad, by the way? Because you know I have to check him out. I am keeping him out of the line of fire. That is a very smart idea. Oh, look, your picture's up from the sheriff's birthday? [Janet]: Yes, it's my new collage. It's just the beginning stages, but... This is my favorite photo of the two of you. [Argument escalates] I've heard enough! - What are they fighting about? - No, that is the truth. We are done. We're done talking. Hey, you. You're finishing your shift today. End of the discussion, Kevin. Do you have something for me? Yeah, actually, I do. This was dropped near the scene of the botched car theft. Actually, Hannah found it. - That's great. - Yep. Did you get a good look at the perp? I didn't. I gave Detective Kingston all the information I have, but, sheriff, I did bring some pecan divines. I know they're your favorite. You are a saint. Thank you so much. Thank you. Oh, these are so good. How do you make them so per-- it's the crunch, isn't it? [Mike]: So sheriff, I figure if I get the origin of this and get the family name, then we're just one step closer... To getting our car thief. Fantastic! Finally something tangible instead of just paperwork. If you've read the paperwork... Okay, I am going to oversee this personally. Mike, you're on point. [Mike]: Well, hold on a second, sheriff.. [Sheriff]: No, no, no, no, no, I do not want to hear anybody's opinion. The place is full of 'em today, and mine's the only one that counts. Mike, you're lead investigator. Kevin, you're finishing your shift. Bill, you're on the desk. Janet... If you'd walk with me, please. 'Course. And, Hannah, please, may I have another? Yes, you may. - Thank you. - Enjoy. Think you're going to need a bigger box. [Hannah]: Lisa! Here I am! [Lisa]: Okay... Here's two, but that's not it. Careful with the cake on the top. [Hannah]: Okay, perfect. [Lisa]: I frosted it with those little rosebuds, so they're a little delicate. Okay, three more inside. [Gary]: Congrats on heading up the "Eden Lake cookbook." Oh, thanks. Are you still taking recipes, or just giving autographs? We're taking recipes 'til the end of the week. Autographs, always. Well, in that case, this is my mother's recipe for her fudge cupcakes. Oh, no way! Yeah, and I would love it if it made it into the cookbook, kind of as a memorial to her. Yeah, of course! I loved your mom's fudge cupcakes! Yeah, everyone loved Mrs. Kohler's cupcakes. I mean, when they were at a potluck, it would get messy. Gary, a quarter cup of a "secret ingredient?" And I have no idea what that is, so I was kind of hoping that you guys could figure that out. We will, and the committee will thank you so much for this recipe. They'll be thrilled. Okay, well, thank you. All right, bye! Wow, finally, a mystery that does not involve a dead body. Mrs. Kohler's fudge cupcakes. Do you know how many of us tried to pry that recipe out of her? [Hannah]: Oh, well, there is a bit of a hitch. Keep reading. Oh, what's the secret ingredient? I'm not sure yet. I tried a bunch of ingredients, but none of those are right. I'm hoping one of these... Well, hold on. I mean, those look right, the condensed milk ones? Mm-hmm, let's hope! Yeah. Well, when they cool off, I'll ice them, and we will try. Okay. Paige! Paige, what are you making? I'd given you a different recipe. Are you making my mother's Hawaiian prawn pot pie? She wants to make sure it gets in the book. [Andrea]: Hello! She knows you don't like it. She knows? She knows. I ate that every week my entire childhood. Hi... Hey, Andrea. Well, don't "oh, Andrea," me! I'm pregnant. We can't let her see this. I can eat whatever I want. Bill will not be happy, that's for sure. [Andrea]: Don't you dare tell him. I would never! [Sophie]: You know, my husband says that we have to remain impartial, but I'm secretly hoping Bill wins. Me too. Hey, Sophie... Ladies. Sheriff! Wow, you ladies are cooking up a storm. Well, looks like you have enough to feed an army. You don't mind, do you? Andrea! You're looking well. - Can I borrow a push pin? - Sure. [Andrea]: Feeling great. - Thank you. - You're welcome. [Faint conversation, indistinct] Um... you know, I'm starving. Do you think I could steal a few of these off you? Of course, you may. There's no crime in that. [Phone rings] Here's a cupcake for you. It's not the right ingredient, but it's pretty good. Oh, can I-- can I get it to go? Sorry. Sure. Here. Why don't you take two? Thank you. Yeah, no problem. [Phone continues ringing] Hey. No, no, no, I can't talk. Mm-mm. No, this isn't it either. All right, but we did agree that the wild rice casserole and the maple-glazed chicken are in, but not the snicker apple salad, right? No. [Andrea]: I don't know why. I loved that. Mm, I loved this, and I definitely loved this. Didn't Bill say that the doctor doesn't want you eating unhealthy things right now? It's fine. I'll eat it in the car on the way home. The snicker salad was too sweet, like these cupcakes. Definitely not Mrs. Kohler's cupcakes. Well, I will keep trying, I promise. I will find the right ingredient. In the meantime, I'll walk you out. Thank you so much, ladies, for all your hard work tonight. Bye! [Hannah]: Do you need me to get that? - Should I get that? - Wait, wait. It's not just the food that he's watching... oh! He won't even let me exercise or anything. Come on, stop complaining. Bill loves you... [Andrea screams] Um... Sheriff Grant? What did you put in those cupcakes? [Emergency operator, on phone]: 911 operator. [Hannah]: My sister and I were just walking out of the community center, - and we found him... - Stay calm, ma'am. [Hannah]: The sheriff's not breathing. I checked his pulse. What is it? He's dead. [Operator]: Is anyone else injured? No, we're fine. We're all fine, and... Help is on the way. Yeah, we'll wait. Thank you. Okay, so, uh, just breathe, okay? Will you take her inside, get her to sit down and have some water? - Sophie? - What? Will you take Andrea inside? Oh, yes, of course. Just get her some water, okay? You'll be all right. Um, okay... Let's maybe just try... [Rings] Eden Lake sheriff's department. This is Hannah Swensen, and I'm trying to reach Detective Kingston. Wait a second, he's right here. Mike, it's Hannah. Hello? You okay? Well, I'm sort of keeping it together, Mike, but, uh... Well, it's the sheriff. He's dead. Oh, my god. Are you okay? Are you safe? [Hannah]: I'm-- I'm fine, but I called 911. [People gasp] I see that. Good job. Units are... Less than two minutes away. Less than two minutes away. I am on my way as well. Look, I'm going to hang up right here. I'm going to call you right now on my cell. Pick up, please, right away. Okay. Hannah? [Cell phone rings] Mike? [Mike]: Tell me everything you did. I checked his pulse. He's not breathing. There's a lot of blood coming from the back of his head. I don't see how. A fall? It seems more like... - He was struck? - I think so. Take a look around. Do you see any surveillance cameras anywhere? [Hannah]: Yeah, yeah. I see one, and it's pointed this way. Now, listen to me. You need to get inside. It's not safe out there. I think it was someone he knew and trusted. Why? He was eating the cupcake I gave him. His gun is in the holster. Hannah, get inside. I'm serious. It's not safe for you out there. - [Bill]: You okay? - Bill. You're here! Wha... Why are you here? I thought you weren't working. I was, uh, picking up, uh, Andrea. I called 911, Bill, and I have Mike on the phone. Here. - Bill? Bill, is that you? - Don't touch anything. 'Course not. Mike, this is, uh, this is bad. I'm not far. I can't believe Hannah found another body. No, Bill, it was Andrea. She saw him first. Andrea? Is she okay? Where is she? She went inside. Take this. Oh, uh... Hey, Mike, Bill went in to check on Andrea. Okay, a squad car will be there any second. I am not far behind. Stay on the phone with me. Do not hang up, okay? Mike, there's a photo of the bracelet that I gave you. It's right here in his car. Do you think maybe he had something big on the car-theft ring? Hannah, I'll check it out. [Police sirens wail] - Oh, they're here. - Who? - Oh, Mike, they're here. - Who is it? It's Kevin Miller and Peterson. - That's Sheriff Grant. - Hannah! There's not a weapon anywhere, and... Can I ask you to come away-- come away from the crime scene. [Mike]: Do what he says, Hannah. Hannah, I need you to promise me that you're not going to interfere with this investigation. I promise. - Check his vitals. - He doesn't have a pulse. [Winters, on TV]: With the gruesome death of Sheriff Grant, residents are terrified of what might be out there. If something like this could happen to Sheriff Grant, who's to say it doesn't happen to any one of us? Whoa, the camera really does add 10 pounds. Oh, but you look fabulous, dear. Oh... Well, thank you. It's one of my favorites. [Indistinct chatter] Lisa, you're friends with Paige Miller, right? Yeah, we went to high school together. I was just wondering why she left the committee meeting so suddenly last night, do you know? You can't possibly be thinking Paige had anything to do with what happened to the sheriff. I'm not thinking anything. I just know she had a problem with the sheriff, and I was wondering what it was. That's all. Beats me. I need access to Detective Kingston. Like I said, he's busy. Leave a number, I'll have him call you. Detective Kingston! Carly winters. Ma'am, I said he's busy. [Winters]: I have information you're going to want to hear. [Janet]: We cannot comment on that at this time. So I've isolated it down to the approximate time of death. Great. This will just take a second. Hey... You need to go home? Oh, I just wish you knew him, Mike, before his son died. You know, he was a good man. You should take a couple days. No, I'm better off working. Listen, here are the phone records you wanted. Okay. So here's what we've got-- coroner found traces of a clay material and surface dirt in the lacerations, along with some hair. [Kevin]: It's ready. All right, let's play it. CC228. Angled in from the alley. What about the reverse CCTV? C227 was down. Down, like, disabled? Completely, for two weeks. I spoke to the custodian. The parts are on back order. Okay, run it. We're synched to the sheriff's exit. [Mike]: He knows the assailant. What does the coroner tell us? The Clay traces in his skull and wound match the construction bricks at the community center. But no weapons found on the scene or anywhere near it. That's Hannah Swensen. Yes, it is. Right there, Hannah Swensen, 6:04. Now, I got a call from here to the sheriff's cell at 7:18. That was me. I called him to review appointment changes that he requested for Wednesday. Did he happen to mention planning on meeting anybody at the community center that night? He just told me he was putting up flyers, and then he made a joke about not really needing them because he'd win the election, and then he said... What? What'd he say then? Then he said Bill would win over his dead body. Hmm. Oh, man! Look at this. [Mike]: Wait a second. Give me a second here. Didn't Bill say he was going home to watch the game? [Mike]: Punch in on this. Yeah, he did. [Andrea]: Thanks for coming with me to the doctor. It's a nice break from Bill. I love him, but the constant doting and over-protectiveness... Frankly, it's a little intense. Did you ask Bill to pick you up last night? Pick me up? No! I got my own car. I'm not an invalid. Why? Bill works with Kevin. I was just wondering how well you know his wife, Paige. Uh, casually. I mean, through different work events, and, of course, mother hired her. That's Mike's car. Mike, listen to me, you need my help on this. You lied to me, man! I mean, I've got you on the surveillance camera right here! Yeah, I explained that. Look, it doesn't look good. You want to help me? You stand down on this. [Bill]: What, indefinite leave? [Mike]: Spend time with your wife, with your kid on the way... Mike. What's going on? I, uh... I had to place Bill on suspension. What? Why? Because I'm the number one suspect in Sheriff Grant's murder. What, are you out of your mind? I have a job. I've got to do it. [Andrea]: Yeah, and I've got a job... To get you out of my house right now, you traitor. Out. Andrea... No, don't "Andrea" me! Out! Out, now! Yeah, keep going! Are you kidding me? I'm leaving. [Andrea]: Yeah, not fast enough. Go! Now! [Hannah]: Wait, no. Mike, come on. You don't really think that Bill is a suspect! Stop! Hannah, this is an open case. Right, I forgot about the law in the municipal code that states Hannah Swensen is not allowed to ask about cases that Detective Kingston is investigating. Subsection two of said law states that Hannah Swensen should trust Detective Kingston to do his job, while admiring his winning smile. Don't forget the addendum on page 321, citing case law that two smiles are better than one? There is something that you could do to help me. You can tell your sister that I'm not the bad guy. Okay? My sister, she has her own code, and you have stomped all over it. Your phone had surveillance footage on it, didn't it? Bill was there. This is the sheriff that we're talking about. It was clearly murder. You've got to let me handle this one, okay? [Engine starts] Okay. Hannah? You promised. [Bill]: Honey, just relax. [Andrea]: No, you know what-- [Bill]: Remember what the doc said, okay? [Andrea]: No, you know, I cannot believe Mike's nerve after everything we've been through with him! [Bill]: Mike is a good guy. He's just doing his job. [Andrea]: I don't care if he's a good guy. Bill lied about where he was last night and said that he was at home watching the game when he wasn't. You're right. I was there. What? But I was there because I was checking in on your sister, okay? What? Look, you don't rest enough, Andrea, and with all the complications, I just, I get worried... Yeah, I follow her sometimes, just to stay close, you know, make sure she's okay. You do that? That's really sweet. It's kind of creepy. It kills me that I can't do anything to help you. I can't take over for the weekend. I just hate that you have to do it alone. - [Andrea]: Bill? - [Bill]: What? The three of us are in this together. [Clears throat] So, uh, I'm going to just go, and I'll let you two, uh... And you know, Mike's a great detective. He's got this. He'll take care of everything. Could you just make me some tea, please? I'll make you a tea if you sit down. Yes, I promise I'm going to sit right down. Make her sit down! I promise. Hannah! Sit! Stay! You're the one who's supposed to sit. Okay, fine, I'll sit. Bill is not going to jail for being a worrywart. This baby needs a father, and I need a husband. You've got to clear Bill's name. Promise me. I promise. [Winters]: Detective Kingston. How can I help you, miss winters? Actually, I'm going to be the one to help you, if you would agree to give me that exclusive on this story in return. Quid pro quo. Fine. What've you got? A story about politics, car thieves. And a man who was determined to keep his job. [♪♪♪] Hmm. Nettie Grant... [Hannah]: Mother, why don't you come with me to pay our condolences? I don't want to go alone. Honey, I was just there. Poor, dear Nettie. Yeah, um, how is she handling it? She's numb. In shock. I don't even think she's cried yet, Hannah. Just can't imagine how difficult this must be for her. Were she and the sheriff getting on well? One shouldn't talk about tragedies. It reduces it to gossip, but... You remember when they lost their son, that tragic car accident? Oh, he was a beautiful boy. Looked just like Nettie. I don't think they ever recovered. Well, must have been when I was in the city. I don't remember. Oh, that's right. Their neighbor, Helen Ross-- I used to partner with her in bridge-- she always overbids. Anyway, she used to tell me that she heard a lot of loud fighting, something about a child, and, obviously, it was about Peter... And now her husband's been murdered. You know, Hannah, when you do go see Nettie, why don't you ask her about her barbecue sauce recipe? It's divine, it'd be perfect for the cookbook, and I think it'd do her spirits a world of good. I'll call her. That's a great idea. [Paige]: Delores? Mr. Feinstein's here for you. Oh! The appraiser! Already! Oh, Hannah, you have just put me behind schedule! Sorry, mother. I'm going to need cookies for fortitude, so put me an assortment together. You know what I like, and, Paige, bring them with you, please. And, ladies, I am off to do battle with Mr. Feinstein! Good luck, mother. [Delores]: Ciao! Can I get you a cup of coffee? Yeah. And I'm going to get my mother's cookies. What a day, hey? Understatement. Thank you, Lisa. Hey, Lis. Hey, I put in a few of your favorites, too. Can I ask you about that awkward moment I noticed between you and the sheriff at the community center? I avoided him whenever possible. Why is that? He was a terrible boss to my husband. He was terrible to Bill, especially after he decided to run against him, but Andrea can be in the same room with him. You didn't last even a minute. You're very observant. I don't know, maybe Andrea's just more civil than I am. I know I should talk nicer about someone who just died, but... Truth is that I'm not sorry he's dead. [Knocks on door] - Hannah. Hi. - Hello. Nettie, I just wanted to see how you were, and I baked these pecan divines especially for you. I remember they were the sheriff's favorites. [Nettie sighs] That's very kind of you. [Hannah]: I know it's a bad time, but... My mother also asked me to check in with you about the famous barbecue sauce recipe you have. I was hoping you'd consider sharing it with me for the Eden Lake charity cookbook? Of course. It's for the children's hospital. She just called, and I was looking for it. Um, uh... You know, hang on, let me go grab it. Great, thanks. I'm sorry, Hannah, please... Come in. Oh. Just be a second. Yeah. You know, if there's anything else I can do, Nettie, I hope you don't hesitate to ask. Thanks, I will. [Nettie]: I'm sure I put it back in this box. I found it! And, um, I don't know how else to say this, but I... but I hope... You don't think that Bill had anything to do with what happened to your husband. Of course I know that. Um... I'm sorry, I don't mean to be rude, but I was just heading out. Oh, of course, I'm sorry. I'm sorry for what you're going through. Who could do something like this, especially in Eden Lake? [Nettie]: Well, you know, Jim deals with a lot of bad people through work. It could be anyone. I mean, even the people on the right side of the law didn't seem to like him much. Why is that, if you don't mind my asking? Oh, after we lost our son, he was never the same... ...but I keep telling myself, without change, there'd be no butterflies, right? [Hannah]: I can only imagine that losing a child would be a huge strain on a marriage. [Knocking on door] Mrs. Grant. Detective Kingston. I should go. I agree. Thanks for the recipe. Excuse us for just one second. Sure. Look, I'm sorry, okay? I'm really sorry, but I shouldn't have promised you because it's my sister, and she made me promise to help her. Well then, un-promise. That's not a thing. Hannah... Listen, Nettie and the sheriff were having problems in their marriage. Does she have an alibi? Because she's definitely hiding something. She claims that she was home alone that night, but I haven't been able to verify that. What about Paige Miller's alibi? Because she already admitted to me that Kevin, your friend from the station, he was not the sheriff's biggest fan. Yeah, him and just about every other deputy. 'Kay, well, what about the surveillance footage? Anything from that? You are irresistible, and I know you know that, but you are less irresistible when you break your promise to me. Mike! Come on, you've got to give me something! Did you know that fingerprints were first used to legally prosecute criminals back in 1911? That is not a thing. [Mike]: Yeah it is. [Hannah]: Nope. Norman! What are you doing here? You sounded upset on the phone, so I left the conference early to see if you needed anything... See if you needed me. I cannot believe that Bill is a suspect. I know, it's ridiculous. Obviously, he's innocent. He had nothing to do with what happened to the sheriff, but he's been suspended. I'm still dealing with this. Well, uh, Hannah, I am all yours, so just tell me what you need. Thank you, Norman! Really appreciate you offering, especially when other people are telling me to stay away from the case. Other people like who? Mike? His loss. Where do we start? Well, I was actually thinking about contacting that reporter, Carly winters? Mm-hmm, yeah, I saw her report this morning. And then, I need to find out more information about Kevin and Paige Miller, but they're not going to talk to me. Okay, well, who would? Mrs. Mccauly just bought all of our angel kisses, and the apple orchard bars are going over really well, but we're going to have to make a couple more dozen of double chocolate cookies for this weekend. Good chat. Thanks! [Hannah]: Well, I just know that you and Paige are friends, so I wondered if you know her husband? Kevin? Yeah, from high school. Paige and Kevin dated in high school? No, they didn't get together 'til after we graduated. Paige didn't really date anybody in high school, except... What? She was with Peter Grant in senior year. Peter Grant, the sheriff's son? The boy who died in the terrible car accident? Paige and I were best friends in high school. She's had a tough time, and she pulled through, and she's an amazing mother. You should leave her alone. I'll see if I can track down that reporter. Great, okay. Oh, Lisa, will you please take my cupcakes out of the oven? I have a new batch trying. 15 minutes! You got it. Norman, how old do you think that little girl is? I'd say about five years old. [Hannah]: That's Lucy. So it's a European family crest? Well, I need the family name. You get me that family name, and I'm going to owe you one, big time... And... And you call me any time, day or night, okay? I need this. [Janet]: Mike? Mayor's here to see you. [Mike]: Goof morning, mayor. Kingston, I only want to hear good news. All right, well, I, um, I heard from Carly winters. The sheriff had set up a meeting with her on Wednesday night. He said he was going to give her a big exclusive on a bust. I think he was about to take down the car theft ring. Yeah, it was the sheriff's M.O. To always break a big case just before election day. My guess is, they got wind of it, and they killed him Tuesday night. But wasn't this Bill's case originally? Bill as a "person of interest" is a no-go on this. Yeah, but how do we know he wasn't in on it? I mean, who tipped them off that the sheriff was onto the ring? The line goes around the block with guys that had a issue with the sheriff. You included? Sure, yeah, right. You want my badge? Is there anybody at this station who doesn't have an alibi? Kevin Miller was on shift that night and didn't have any... [Petersen]: Mike? I got the VIN numbers from the dealership for you. Oh, great, just leave that on my desk for me, please. Great, thanks, man. Kevin Miller was on shift that night without any corroboration as to his exact whereabouts. Well, you know better than me if it's cop-on-cop, but if it's Miller, or Bill, or even you, internal affairs is going to be all over this, so get a lock on it asap. [Hannah]: Moishe? [Moishe meows] What are you doing out here? Aw, kitty! What're you doing? Oh, hello, little cutie. Let's go inside where it's warm. [Creaking] [Truck peels away] Have I got this right? The guy that knocked you over the night of the car thefts, is there any chance that he saw you pick up that bracelet? I don't know, but Mike... Your house was broken into, wasn't vandalized, and... Nothing's missing. Right, but Mike, listen to me. I don't think that Kevin Miller is the father of Paige's child. [Officer]: Detective Kingston! Uh, guys, over here. Dust for prints around here, likely point of entry. Hannah, did you happen to see if he was wearing gloves or not? Um, yeah, I think he was. Either way, dust and see what you can get. It's fine. Okay, so... Okay. I found out that Peter Grant and Paige were dating in high school. Okay, so what does that have to do with a car-theft ring and a man in a black truck breaking into your house? I don't know, but when I was at Nettie Grant's house, I saw an envelope from a family law group, like, attorneys, so... Okay... What if the sheriff was trying to get custody of that child away from Paige and Kevin? And I also found out that the sheriff had arrested Paige's father a couple years ago. The man is still in prison. Okay. Hey, guys? I need you to get three more cars and set up a perimeter surveillance around Hannah's house. Both of you, please, okay? Get on that. So... Just back up for a second here. What you're saying, in the labyrinth of your mind, Kevin and Paige killed the sheriff because the sheriff was going to take away their kid? It's a possibility. [Norman]: Hannah! Norman! - Hey. - Hi. Hey. Oh my gosh, are you okay? I can't believe this. She's fine. Yeah, but thank you for checking on me. Yeah, of course. It's, uh... What's going on? What are you doing here? Your mother called me, threatening to come over here herself, so I assured her I was on my way. Oh, thank you. I've got guys watching the house, I've got new locks on the doors, and I have a very elaborate alarm system going in first thing tomorrow morning, so... Great, thank you. Thanks. Um... Are you going to be okay tonight? I can crash on the couch if you need, or... As much as I like you, Norman, I'm already on that couch tonight, so that's... Oh... you know what? Um... I think that no one's going to sleep on that couch tonight, but thank you, both. So sweet. Honestly, I do feel safe, and I really appreciate that, but I think I'm just tired, and I'm going to go get some rest, so... good night. Good night. Okay. There is nothing but sadness here today for Eden Lake's favorite son and longtime sheriff. Authorities want to remind everyone that the perpetrators are still at large, and if you have any information, to please step forward. Hannah Joanne, maybe you should just step back and stay safe, please. When have you ever known me to step back, mother? That's the truth. - Hannah... - Oh, Gary, hi. Hi, Delores. Um, my sister, Edna, she's not great at returning phone calls, but I was thinking that she might be able to help you find that mystery ingredient for the cupcakes. Oh, fantastic! Thank you so much, Gary! And don't forget my prawn pot pie recipe, honey. Thank you so much. [Delores]: Yes. Thank you. [Organ plays] I'm so sorry. [Delores]: There's Nettie. This can't be an easy day for her. You should've seen her yesterday. Not one tear. Oh, everyone grieves in their own way, Hannah! Maybe. Don't your maybes always mean "no"? Maybe. [Janet sobs] Oh, Janet, I'm so sorry. You're not here alone, are you? Where's your boyfriend? Brad couldn't make it. Oh, well, I'm sorry. It's okay. [Delores]: You just let us know if you need anything. I feel like a robot set on automatic. Oh, of course, you do. Look at them. I need to talk to you about this case. I need your help on this. You name your time and place, I'm there. Watch how they'll struggle to say nice things about Jim. Don't worry. He was a good man, and we know that. We're here. Hi. Hi, honey! Look at you! You're looking good. All of us are devastated at the loss of such a respected member of our community. We're locking our doors. I mean, this kind of thing just doesn't happen here, usually. Paige? Lucy, hi. Hi, Lucy. I'm so sorry to bother you, but can I talk to you, Paige? Hey, Paige, let's go. What does she want? [Winters]: What kind of father was he? Oh, he was a wonderful father. Kevin Miller drives a black truck? You told me that he didn't have an alibi for that night. Hannah? I don't want you following him. I won't. I don't have time anyway. I have a date with a file clerk. You have a date? Just put it back where you found it. I know. We're six months behind. Budget cut. These are the newest family court files, so... Okay, well, I brought you, um, some cherry winks. They're cookies. Enjoy, and thank you. Thank you. I'll just be over there if you need me. Okay. Thanks. [Screams] Sorry! Sorry, sorry. Norman, you scared me. I didn't mean to freak you out. It's all right, I'm just losing my mind, but guess what I found out! Norman, Nettie was going to divorce the sheriff. That's what the family law documents were! Makes Nettie a suspect and explains why she wasn't exactly a grieving widow at the funeral. Spouses are always the first suspect, right? Always. Norman, casually turn to your right. There's a black truck parked. Same make and model. The very same one. The truck from your house last night? Happens to be the same type of truck that Kevin Miller drives. What do we do? Stay here. Don't move. [Peels out] He's gone. I'm texting Mike. This has got to stop. What's our next move? I don't see Kevin's truck. Hmm.. [Phone text chimes] [Knocks] [Paige]: Yeah, just hold on a second. Hey, Paige. [Paige]: Hey. We're looking for Kevin. Uh, he's not here. Did he say where he might be going? Um, some errands? Mommy, mommy, I want some more milk! Hey, Luce. How's it going? I want some more milk. Okay, hold on, Luce. Mommy's busy. You okay? Yeah! It's just one of those days, you know? After the funeral, the sitter fell through, couldn't get to work. - Okay. - Okay. - Bye. - Bye. - Hey, Paige? - Yeah? We heard there was a little bit of tension between you and the sheriff at the community center the other night. What was that about? Well, you both know better than me he was a hard person to like. - Nothing more? - Nothing more. Okay. Just tell Kevin we stopped by. Thanks. She was definitely giving off some weird vibes. The night of Sheriff Grant's murder, Kevin responds to the ten-zero-zero, but his whereabouts 45 minutes earlier, the time of the murder, we only have his word. Hmm. How does Kevin connect to the theft ring? Your guess is as good as mine, but Kevin and his black truck aren't here. [Knocking] Maybe she just doesn't want to talk to me. [Norman]: Okay, well... But I don't get it. This is her car. I know where she is. [Hannah]: Just... Give me a minute, Norman. [Norman]: Okay, I'll be right over here. I used to bring Peter here every day when he was little. He just wanted to go higher... And touch the sky with his toes. What happened? Peter was Jim's universe. And after the accident? Peter's death broke Jim... Broke his spirit. Broke mine, too. Jim had forced Peter to end it with Paige. It led to a bitter fight. Peter stormed out. It wasn't 20 minutes later the phone rang. Peter was dead. Jim blamed himself for the accident. I did, too. I understand... Why you suspect me, Hannah... And I don't care. Don't you think that your granddaughter, Lucy, deserves to have you in her life? I know she's your granddaughter. It takes all my self-control to stop myself from running up to her. Why don't you? When Jim and I realized that Lucy must be Peter's daughter... Jim went crazy. He, um, went into attack mode. He threatened and bullied Paige with her past. He said terrible things to her. It just drove Paige further away. She hates us... And I don't blame her. [Norman]: Wheels still spinning, huh? Thank you. The sheriff forced his son to break up with Paige, and they had a huge fight about it afterward, and Peter stormed out, and that's the night he died. Nettie held her husband responsible for their son's car accident. Can I have the ketchup? Sounds like a motive for murder to me. I don't know... Right? Well, it's no wonder why the marriage went bad, but I don't think Nettie did. You should have heard her voice. She just wants to be a grandmother to Lucy. So where does that leave us? Wheels still spinning. Oh, Hannah, the girl who loved mysteries so much, she became one. What are you thinking? I'm thinking about my dad, how happy my parents were before he died, and Bill and Andrea getting ready to have a baby... And then there's Nettie and everything she's been through. It's confusing. Am I weird? Absolutely, but I dig weird, so... Well, welcome to weird central! Look no further. Oh, I won't. Hannah? You opened early! Ah, I couldn't sleep, and, you know, I need to bake when I'm thinking. So, uh, I made a new batch. Do you want to give it a try? Okay. [Lisa]: Yum! This is fantabulous... But? But I think the secret ingredient's still keeping its lips sealed. I knew it. Where're you going? One mystery is going to be solved today. Bravo! Bravo! My mother kept that recipe well guarded. Leave it to Gary to find it-- Some of it at least. You know, I would've called ahead, but Gary said that you weren't returning calls. His calls. He can be a bit of a pain sometimes. Sorry, I didn't mean to pry. Oh, no, no, it's... My son, John, there, he looks up to him for whatever reason, but a salvage yard really isn't the place for a young kid. Well, he's not that young anymore now, but he's still my little boy. That's a nice picture of you and your brother. [Edna sighs] Oh, I could smack him with a frying pan. What are those bottles on the window sill? [Edna]: Oh, my mother collected those! Raspberry syrup. She'd use them for vases and... I never tried raspberry syrup! [Gary]: Gary's auto. Oh, hey, Hannah! Sure, yeah. I can meet you down at the cookie jar. All right, I'll see you there. I haven't tried, so I can't make any promises, but she's pretty sure. - I solved it! - Really? Really. Of course! The bottles she collected... It's raspberry syrup, isn't it? Well, we're about to find out. Let's prove it, right? Yes! Let's do that! Here goes nothing. Mm! These are really good! That's her recipe! Exactly! It's perfect! [Door opens] Oh, hi, Janet. Hi, Hannah. Thanks for that. Hey, Tyler, can you take care of the deliveries in the back for me? Thank you. Double chocolates, right? Oh, no, I, uh... Ah, why not? I've given up on dieting! How are things at the station? Honestly, Hannah, they're just not really the same. I can imagine. Been thinking about going down to the station 'cause I need to talk to Kevin. Is he working today? Well, he should be. I could check the roster when I get in. You know, you have a unique perspective there. Bill told me you're the one to go to for solving problems. I love those guys. They're my family. Look, I heard that there was a problem between Kevin and the sheriff. Oh, at Lucy Miller's birthday party, yeah. Right... Uh, $3.95. Oh, there's four. Thank you. Why would Kevin and Paige invite the sheriff to their daughter's birthday? You know, I don't really know. The sheriff just kind of showed up, then it got really bad from there. What were they arguing about? I don't know. You know, I just saw them, but I wasn't within earshot. Listen, Hannah, Kevin's got a temper, but he's also got a big heart. Enjoy your cookies. Thanks. Bye. That's him. I'm doing it. [♪♪♪] [♪♪♪] Mike, I've been following the black truck. Don't be mad. Call me when you get this. [♪♪♪] [♪♪♪] [♪♪♪] [Kevin]: Why're you following me? Why are you following me? What are you talking about? I work here. You have a second job. The other guys at the department don't know about this, okay? It's against policy. When did Paige find out that she was pregnant with Peter's child? Not until after the accident. And that's when you came into her life? I loved Paige all through high school. I just wanted to protect her. We're a family now. Lucy is my daughter. I love her. Paige didn't think that the grants had a right to know that they are Lucy's grandparents? Not after the way he and Nettie treated her, and more than anything, she was afraid that he was going to take Lucy away. And that's what you and the sheriff fought about at Lucy's birthday party. He wanted custody. The sheriff hated Paige. He had arrested Paige's father for armed robbery. He didn't want his son dating the daughter of a criminal. Where were you at the time of the sheriff's murder? Look, I didn't want anyone to know about it. I'm overworked. I fell asleep in my cruiser on shift. I'm not proud of it, but it's the truth. Are you okay? Hey, sweetie, just get down for a sec, okay? Stay right here. You going to lock us up? No, that's not why we're here. It's time, Paige. They're not going to take Lucy away from us. How do you know that we can trust her? I don't know, but for Lucy's sake, I'm willing to try. I'm so sorry, Paige. I want you to meet Mrs. Grant? Hi, Lucy. Why are you so sad? [Nettie]: Oh, sweetheart... I can't tell you how happy I am to meet you. Looks like you might need a push? I like to go high. Are you ready? Yes. Okay, here we go. High to the sky. High to the sky! [Mike]: Just when I don't think you could impress me anymore, you go and pull something like you did today and prove me wrong again. Whoa! Mike Kingston admitting he's wrong? You ruined the moment. This is a moment? I'd like it to be. Fresh out of suspects, you know, now that it's not Nettie, or Paige, or Kevin... Now, that classifies as a moment, and a pretty good one, if I do say so... You're ruining it. I'd better go in. Okay. I'll call you if I hear anything. Oh, now you're sharing information with me? Ha! Maybe you should kiss me more often. Maybe I will. For the record, you kissed me. Well, we know it's not Nettie, it's not Paige, and it's not Kevin, but it could still be a crime of passion. I could still be right about that. I just have to... I have to go back to the store. I have to go back to the source! That's what I have to do! I have to go back to the beginning, and I'm going to do that, and you're going to stay here, and I'll go figure this out. I should get dressed first, and I'm not leaving this with you. Nice try! [Meows] I knew you wouldn't sleep. Oh, really? Yeah, I have that effect on women. Don't get ahead of yourself. You find anything? Just you. So what are you thinking? I still think it could be a crime of passion. Or maybe it's just made to look that way. I mean, with Nettie and all of them out of the way, I think we've got to step back and just look at this whole thing objectively. The sheriff was just about to bust a big case, the car-theft ring, and... in homicide, the easy answer usually is the answer. You're right. We should step back. Start from the beginning, right? So, the sheriff comes out of the building, holding a plate of cupcakes. [Mike]: Yup. Footage shows that he sees someone that he knows. But he's holding a cupcake in his hand, not his gun, so that proves that, right? Then he walks over to that person, out of range of the cameras. And he never drew his gun, so he didn't feel threatened. Still, that doesn't really prove anything. Okay... Hey, what about the spontaneity, right? They didn't bring a weapon with them. Correct. That's right, they just grabbed whatever was lying around, something close by. They didn't plan to kill him. Okay, that still doesn't prove crime of passion, I mean, and the sheriff was not the most passionate guy. Yeah, but Nettie said that he was before his son died. Yeah, but she said afterwards, he kept it all bottled up inside. Right. What if he didn't? What if he just found a different sounding board, someone to think things through with? Like we do. What ifs aren't evidence. What if it was the car-theft ring? Why didn't they take those files, all Bill's paperwork, everything related to them? True. So where does that leave us? I got nothing. Come on, I'll follow you home. I'm a big girl, Mike Kingston. I can see myself home. Gee, Detective Kingston, you're not a very good listener. [Laughs] The worst. Good night. Mike... Go! Get in the house! Hannah! You're not a very good listener, are you? The worst. Come on, you're not going to just let our best lead get away, are you? [Phone rings] [Mike]: That's my phone. Mike, the crest on the bracelet that I found, the family name is Morse? Kind of in the middle of something here. No, I know, but... You think it's any relation to Edna mores? Edna mores? Yeah, the... Gary kohler's sister. Wait, the guy who owns the auto salvage yard? Right. Her son, John mores, works there. Wait, there he is. [Hannah]: And we're headed right for the salvage yard. [Mike]: I mean, the family business would be a good place to chop up cars, right? [Mike]: Don't move. [Hannah]: I'm listening. We got a 10-94 with possible 1-87 suspect at the salvage yard. Roll me backup, code three. [♪♪♪] [Object clatters] [Gun clicks] [♪♪♪] [♪♪♪] [Object clatters] [Mike]: Freeze right there! Don't move, put your hands up. Get 'em up! Mike, behind you! Put the gun down real slow. You're trespassing on private property without a warrant, and you're pointing a gun at my nephew. How'd you know the sheriff was after you? What? You think I killed the sheriff? Yeah, well, the gun pointing at me is kind of leading me in that direction, yeah. [Hannah screams] Hey, hey, hey, hey! [Gary]: What're you doing? [Grunts] [Mike]: No, no! Hannah! Hannah! Go! [Gunshots] Don't move. I'd listen to her, if I were you. [Police sirens approach] Watch your head. [Faint conversation, indistinct] Hannah? Hannah! You know I didn't do this, right? You know me. I've done a lot of things in my life I'm not proud of, I know that, but... I'm not a killer, Hannah. You think you'll use my mom's recipe? It's kind of the last thing on my mind. I'll see what I can do, Gary. Hannah! Detective Kingston, I get it. It's your crime scene. I'm not doing anything. We've got to get this guy processed, and it could take a while, okay, so why don't you, uh... [Grunts in pain] Mike, are you all right? Yeah, I'm all right. I'm fine. - Bill! - Yeah? Take the lovely miss Swensen to the station, please, get a statement from her... You bet. And you're going to want to suit up, officer. You're back on shift. Welcome back, man. Yeah. Hey, watch your back. What? Janet, yeah, we got three perps coming in. Make sure booking is all ready to go, okay? We'll be there real soon. Yes. Thank you. Hey, so, uh, listen... Thanks. Just got to put together a witness package. It'll take a couple of seconds. All right, well, I will wait here. Oh, look at that! Hannah Swensen learning something. There's coffee in the back if you want some. Welcome back. Thanks, man. Hey, Bill, can I get your eyes on this? [Hannah]: Janet? Hannah! Hi. I'm sorry. Oh, no, I'm sorry, Janet. I don't mean to intrude. I'm waiting to talk to Mike. He's obviously pretty busy right now. I just... can't bring myself to take it down. Gary, right? Just doesn't feel right. I've known him my whole life. Yeah, me too. I guess you never really know anyone. Right. Will you excuse me, please? I, um... Need to go to the bathroom. [Hannah]: Janet! Hannah. I need to go home. I just have to... be home. I read your letters. Found them in your desk drawer. Undelivered. Every one of them. It started after the accident. He blamed himself. He felt... guilty. Terribly. Jim loved Peter. You helped him. You listened. I got him to talk... About his feelings. That wasn't easy for Jim. Did he know how you felt? No... Not until that night. Here we go. - Jim. - Hey. [Janet]: I thought he was ready to hear me. Things had changed. Nettie had filed for divorce, so I thought now... He would see you. Yeah. [Sheriff, mouth full]: Have you tried these? They're not quite kohler's, but have one... Uh, no, thank you. What, you on a diet? You look nice today, by the way. Uh, you have a date with... um... Sorry, I should know this. What's his name? Brad. Right, Brad. Okay. Papers you want me to sign? Janet? There is no Brad. What? There's only you, Jim. It's always only been you. [Janet]: I told him... I loved him. Only you. All those heart-to-heart conversations we've had, all those late nights together at the station... You gave me your trust, Jim, and I gave you mine, and now, I'm giving you my heart, and I know that you love me, too. Stop. Have you been drinking? No, no! We are more than friends, Jim. You can't deny this. Okay, listen to me. Listen to me. You're going to go home, and you're going to get your head together. Do you understand me? No more of this talk! You can't deny this! I don't know what is going on with you, but stop it! Go home, get some sleep, clear your head, or don't come in tomorrow. He fired me. [Janet, in memory]: I love you so much, Jim! You're fired. Stop it. No! Don't say that. You don't mean that! [Screams] Oh, my... Oh, my god, no, no! No, Jim! Oh, my god, no! Jim! [Sobbing] Oh, god, no... Oh, no, no... [Janet]: Where is someone like me to go? I have no home. Jim was my home. I've got to take you back... To the station. I didn't mean to hurt him. What am I going to tell the guys back at the station? They're my family. You're going to tell them the truth. Come on, let's go home. You broke your promise to me. Following a case that you said that you wouldn't, jumping into my car... You can't keep doing this, Hannah. You can't keep putting yourself in danger... But... You were right. Good job. [Phone text chimes] - Bill! - What? It's Andrea! We've got to go! Go! Go! [Bill]: We're going to have a baby! [Delores]: Look at the little mouth. Hi. [Bill]: I got her, I got her, I got her. [Delores]: Hi, sweetie pie. [Bill]: Hello, little one. We're going to have so many adventures together, just you and me. Yeah... The station's been crazy busy, but you know what? They've waited a week... [Andrea] Sweetie, could you go get me something from the cafeteria, please? Yeah, sure. May I have a turn? You want to meet someone? - Aw! - Okay. Auntie Hannah... Meet... Tracy... Hannah... Todd. What? Oh... Really? Mm-hmm. That's so beautiful. Thank you. [Bill]: So you want some soup? Thank you. [Delores]: I'll have a cup of coffee, Bill. Three generations of Swensen women. If only the world knew what it was in for. [Laughing] [Norman]: Oh, my gosh. Congratulations. Hey! Norman! Norman's here. How perfect. Oh, my gosh! So beautiful. Isn't she? Norman, that's really sweet, but you actually can't have flowers in this part of the hospital. What? It's a maternity ward thing, honey. Right. Oh, yeah, I should know that. Sorry. Hey, Norman, I just want to say thank you... For everything. Couldn't have done it without my wingman. Of course... [Andrea]: Norman? Flowers, right. Sorry, I'll go ditch these. Bye. Congratulations. Congratulations to you on all your beautiful women. Thank you! Wingman, huh? You know, any woman would be very lucky to get him. I know, mother. And the love triangle continues. It's not a love triangle. It's more like a pyramid shape. Where exactly does Mike fit in on all of this? I'm looking at baby Tracy. No... At her perfect little smile. No, that is a diversion. Talk to her about it because she's going to take a side. I want to see my granddaughter. Welcome to the family, little one. [Hannah]: As we search and sort through life's many ingredients and recipes in an attempt to make that perfect fudge cupcake, that perfect moment, or that conscious choice to try, fail, and then try again, we must never lose sight that, no matter what, love and true happiness are always homemade.
