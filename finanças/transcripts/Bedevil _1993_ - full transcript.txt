OMINOUS CHORDS (Cries out) DRAMATIC MUSIC (Boy screams) MUSIC CLIMAXES (Man laughs) The ghost swamp. Yeah, that was me. I was seven at the time. I was OK. They fished me out. (Laughs) (Sighs) Yeah. Yeah. But I hated that place. That...island. I've always loved this place - our island home. The swamp business is the only true tragedy we've had. During the Second World War, the island was full of American soldiers. Yanks, Yanks, Yanks, everywhere. They were stationed here. Then, one night... a poor GI - strange type - whom I knew, drove his tank straight into the quicksand swamp. Sank, without a trace, and was never found. CHATTERING The children in the area have always told tales about him - the ghost of the GI pulling them in. CHATTERING PEACEFUL, HAPPY MUSIC He said he saw the ghost here once, when he was very young. Oh, yes, Rick, the youngest Waddy boy. People never knew how sweet he could be. MYSTERIOUS MUSIC He'd break into my shop and steal all my things. But I'd always catch him. (Boy grunts) JAUNTY PIANO MUSIC Those eyes, looking up at me, and he'd always, always beg me - "Please, please, don't tell Uncle. He'll kill me if you do." But I'd never tell. I suppose I should have... but I never did. I cared for him. No-one else seemed to. I think his mother tried... but...those step-uncles. I shouldn't say it, but I don't think his home life was... DRAMATIC FLOURISH How long have I lived on the island? My father built the main road through the island in 1926. I was four when my mother and I joined him. So, if I was four in 1926, that makes me... (Mouths) 70. WHISTLING Anybody seen the saw? Er, over at the left. Behind the ladder. Behind the ladder. Yeah, I'll get it... Oi! Give me that!

Ta. It's not only that, it's these guys over here. Clowns, they're clowns. They just run around chucking things everywhere. Oh, babe! (Laughs) For me? Like that, babe, hey? Mmm. (Chuckles) What the hell is this? I don't know. Don't know, really. What is it, babe? Nothing to worry about. It's just an old hat, alright? It says "Made in the USA". I don't know about that.

What do you think of my netball team? (All cheer) (Woman sings) # I gaze into the distance # To see the hills of home # And then I start to wonder why ever did I roam? # From friends I left behind me, in Alice Springs to roam # My rambling days are over, and I'm going home # To those far-distant ranges, valleys and plains # Mother nature's calling me back home again # There's 50 miles before me, 900 miles behind # And this old Ghan is rocking me back home on time # When loneliness and sorrow and trouble comes my way # Friends, I have so many, to help me any day # When sickness overtakes me, I won't be all alone # My dear old folks are waiting to welcome me home... # Want to hear spooky story? First, a tour. Charleville was once a great western town, and people owned vast cattle and sheep stations. Land sold only for one cent an acre. Now it's gone up to $2 an acre. Old curios, antiques, old typewriters, old lamps, old telephones. Mr Hobson. (Man speaks Chinese) A train driver used to live here alone, a well-known chap in these parts, but strange - he never spoke. EERIE MUSIC He was the main driver in this region for 50 years, then, one day, while in his 80s, he went missing. There was a search party up and down the river here. Something had happened in his past, something haunted him. Bedevilled, he was - he couldn't live with it anymore. They found him hanging from...that! Choo, choo, choo - they hear him, but they can't see him. Wait, there is someone - an old alcoholic called Mickey. Go and see him. He knows the train story. He might be in the horrors by now, but he can yarn, old Mickey. I...I have a friend. Visits me here at night. She's a ghost... but I call it a spirit. Who is she? I don't want to tell who it is. Well, it's not the little girl. EERIE MUSIC The little... These spirits... Perhaps they do try to tell us something. I try to work it out. I believe in these things.

We've already marinated it overnight in juniper berries, wine and fresh herbs. Herbs of this area. We've stuffed the pig with bush onions and we'll serve it with sweet potatoes and yam. But while we're waiting on it, we've got the entree happening. This is a yabby. It's very much like a freshwater prawn or shrimp. The flavour, though, is a lot stronger. We're tossing them around here in some canola oil, a pinch of chilli and garlic. (Speaks Aboriginal language) Oh, sorry. Of course - thyme. Hey! Hey! Come here! Over here! (Speaks Aboriginal language) She's telling them that she can't cook it now, but we'll take it home and she'll make it into a snake terrine, served with a walnut vinaigrette.

You know she's not from around here. She's from the Torres Strait Islands. Her people are still quite traditional in their ways, especially concerning things like marriage. Emelda had a son. Beba. He was her only child. She was never the same after he died. It's just a bit of a logjam... Doesn't matter. We trust you. The alderman I donated to... Doesn't matter. ..well, he just forgot - you know what council's like. The alderman has let me down. We catered for his daughter's 21st... No. Big delays here.

Er, 24 hours and they're out of here - 24 hours, tops! You had trouble here a while back - yeah, I remember. It was in the paper. See? Look! What? What trouble? Guys, I can explain the whole situation. No shit, Dimitri. Let's go. OK, OK, OK. There were these two kids from up north, from the Islands, I think. Beba was this Islander dude, and Minnie, this hippie chick. Guys, we're going 12 years back. These kids, they were in a bad way. They needed work, so I...put 'em on. Oh, you are so nice, Dimitri. Nice? I'm nice. Yeah, he's a real nice bastard. It was about marriage. The whole clan were down on them. They had to get the hell out. DRAMATIC MUSIC And then the mother, Emelda, came looking for them. Found 'em down here. Jeez, what a fuss she caused. I want to see the contract, Dimitri. And then, after Emelda moved in with them, that's when things got really strange. Dimitri, we're not interested in your story now, because you always are very... LIGHT MUSIC DRAMATIC MUSIC Aah! Aah!
