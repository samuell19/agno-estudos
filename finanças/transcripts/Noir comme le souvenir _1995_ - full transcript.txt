... BLACK FOR REMEMBRANCE You should perhaps dance with Chris, Your eyes are devouring him. Maybe, but it's Caroline you are looking at. Garance! Your dress is like mine! My parents are richer than yours Rogue! Thief! Mom! Pamela has torn my dress and has hurt Bilbo. eleven 00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:17.661 It's your fault, you must have made the same dress for both. Oh, no, Pamela's family ! The billions have gotten onto their head! - How about going to the swing? - Bilbo says it's OK if you give me a condy. fifteen 00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:32.469 Garance, "candy" is said, not "condy" Alright, I'm going to go make dinner. - Who is with me? - Charmed. Not me! It was my fault, I'll go with you What is that? Perhaps a dog has fallen into a trap. Sometimes people make such noises. Don't move, I'll go see. 2. 3 00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:10,786 And if it's a wolf, dad? Garance ... There are no wolves in Beaumont. Nothing can happen here. You know it's our magic forest. Hey, you look like my clown. I can't, clown. I can't move, Dad does not want me to. Is it a surprise from Dad? It's him that wants me to come with you Pamela! Pamela! 3. 4 00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:41.784 Garance? Stay there, thief. Pamela! Come here quickly! - What were you doing? - Nothing, Mom. BODY OF Garance CORDAY FOUND: THE GIRL WAS BURNT AND DECAPITATED Garance Corday murder: Inspector Vasseur closes file 17 YEARS LATER Chris, did you bring the pizzas? If you keep drinking I don't know what I'll do here. 4. 5 00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:04.989 Today's a day that hurts me. Do you understand? I want to forget it. That's Chris Corday, He comes with a different woman every evening. What an fine jacket, Where did you get it? - I've sewn it myself. - You see? Your daughter sews. Bravo, you do very well. All my friends have one as well. I have to do the same if not I'll look like an idiot. - The coffee is cold. - He was punctual. Aren't you hungry, want to eat? - The croissants are frozen. - Then go get some fresh ones. Always me. And her? Everything is for her. I exist too! - One day I'll give you a slap. - Of course not. But of course. - What are you doing today? - I've to see Lucie at the store. - I'll drop you. - No, that's fine I'm expecting Fidelia - Fidélia? - Yes. What do you have against her? She's very good. She even taught in Haiti. Voodoo, no doubt. What happens to you? You look sad. it's Garance's birthday. - I'm sorry. - That's OK - I'm coming. - Don't be too late. Let's go. He smokes, He smokes! After school I want to go to Jenny's place. Her mother's making Spaghetti. - And she's going to pick you up? - Of course, she's even driving me back home. Garance. My little. I am not late, am I? Not at all. Today would been 23 today. In my country the dead don't have an age. Let her sleep in peace. Yes, I'll leave her. I always take flowers to her grave on her birthday. While I came in just now, I had a feeling of being suffocated. The house must be haunted by an evil eye. Mom... Shit! Mom... Lucie, is that you? - Mom... - Garance? I find them! Pamela, look, the cushions. it's an express delivery. - I hope the work is not. - They're exquisite, right? Do you think that will suit my dining room? I've changed everything. Lacquer and shantung, nothing more. Yes, China is fashionable right now. Caroline, Pamela precedes fashion. - Don't follow. - Let's not exaggerate. That's just a small talent in anticipation. Tina! Sorry, I have to go. Take care of the lady. See you soon in your magnificent home. With pleasure. I'll start with the new arrivals Come see the tones in the light Oh, no, it's very ordinary. You think so? Why did you bolt off like that? Do you work at Fedex now? I'm sorry, it's that when I was in the basement I had a hallucination. - Can you accompany me to the cemetery? - Is Garance's birthday! - Of course! - Thank you. - Pamela is very pretty. - She's pretty but thick With a fortune and endless bad taste. Good for you But reduce the price a bit, huh? What do you think? Decorating is not selling rugs. I forgot Pamela went to kindergarten with Garance. - She envied her books, clothes ... - And her father too. Remember how she looked at Chris? Chris always had success Garance with friends. And with Pamela it still lasts. If you saw her flirting as he bought her a painting. If I was Chris I'd worry. Oh, Chris ... - Are you still seeing him? - Don't. As usual flirty and a little less drinking. When I think what a good husband it was ... Do you often think of him? No. - Shall we go? - Yes. Can I borrow this? Can you lend me this? Thank you. Look! Chris has brought her violets. She liked them so much ... The angel, it's been beheaded Like Garance. Gimme that. To Garance. Dark as the memory. What is happening, Lucy? - What is it, Caroline? - Father, Garance ... - Garance? - She's back. Come. I'm sure you think I dreamt it all. If it wasn't you, I wouldn't believe it. I'll get you something to drink. He had gotten into the dresser. The window! it's the clown ... Garance. He had disappeared with her I don't want Mélinda to see it. - Hello, Lucy. - Hello. - I saw Melinda at the dance school. - Once a year does not hurt. - Window... - Someone's thrown a stone and broken it. I've thrown the garden. - What are you talking about? - Tom will investigate this. - Investigate?! - Caroline will explain it. It's not funny Lucy! What's up? Garance's clown was in bed. Lucy, are you sure it wasn't a thief? No. Tell mom I'm taking these clothes for Pamela. Mom, it wasn't a thief! What happened to Sultan? - Are you sure you won't come to the party? - No, I won't. You'll do well. Greet so many freeloaders ... What is this, a sample for the curtains? I found it in the garden today. I was wearing it the day Garance was kidnapped. She had the same. - We fought because of him - It was 17 years ago, my love. You told me. The prescription. And those cherries have had time to mature. Don't think of it anymore. I'll be back soon. Anyone there? Duchess! Duchess! Come! Where are you, filthy cat? - I never get used to this. - At my apartment? I'm a cop and I live with a star. Well, I've gotten used to a cop. - I was a little ??? with ginger. - ginger? Excuse me You have forsaken the keys at the door. - Am I disturbing you? - Not at all! - You want a drink? - Please. Do you want too? - Thank you. - Sit down. I wanted to ask you what do you think of what happened. it's clear that someone wants to brutally bring back the memory of Garance. The tomb, the statuette, flowers, the note. What I see is that Garance's death has ended the Cordays' marriage, I wonder if now someone wants to end mine using the supposed ghost of Garance. But who could it be? I can't think of another that ... Chris Corday. He's impossible, He's incapable of that. - Go ... - Go? - No, nothing. - "Go", "nothing"? Forgive me. I'm sorry. - I just needed to talk to someone. - it's normal. - Tom, could you look into this? - Of course Well, I'll get going Forgive me. Yes? Oh my god Classes began yesterday. Today we celebrate the new school year, and we hope that our students are as competitive as possible. And now, our little students will perform their greatest success with sealed lips That way, there won't be any mistakes in text. What happened? They have murdered Pamela and they tried to burn the house. - We should not speak ill of the dead. - Yes, but what a horrible end. It's Garance, She is back with a vengeance. - You're Mélinda, I know you. - Oh yeah? - Who you are? - Garance. Take your mask off. I've never seen in school. - There is another thing ... - What? - David came home last night. - But he said he had an emergency. - He didn't tell you because he suspected Chris. - Of what? - Of all that you told me. - But that's not possible. How can you say that? Jealousy goes with love. Calm down. I'm off to the store. And then, these children get on my nerves. Good that I have been escaped. - Did I sing well, Lucy? - Yes, my little nightingale. - Do nightingales like candy? - Yes. Fidélia! I have to go, Could you stay and watch over Melinda. That's why I'm here! Mom, I want a "condy" Garance! Garance! Garance ... Mom, will you buy me a pink and green ring? If you want but why? I promised it for my new friend, Garance. - For Whom? - Garance is her name. Since when do you you know her? I met her today, at the party. And how is she? Gorgeous! Blonde with eyes blue like the heaven. Well, now go to sleep. Good morning, Ms. Longville! Hello Kitty. Have I changed that much? Don't be angry. I haven't seen you in 5 years, I think. I have the right to be surprised. I had no intention of coming, and besides, I don't want to bother you. It's been long since anyone bothered me I get up early and alone. As an eternal bachelor. I need to speak with you. Everything is in place. - Want some coffee? - Yes. I saw Genevieve Longville in her garden. Oh, that ... You won't see her elsewhere. She is a vegetarian, she likes only her plants. And adores only her brother. She has a brother? I didn't know it. Yes, a certain Guillaume. You've found your armchair Yes. He lived a long time in Italy I think. He returned About ten years ago, when his wife died Poor old man. Swapped spaghetti for boiled vegetables. The old woman is a witch with herbal tea Water and you you have never been friends. And Dr. Wahl Are you still happy? I hope sometimes he's in your arms. I didn't come here to talk about my family. But Garance. - Geneviève! - Yes! - Who were you talking to? - Well, you'll see. Come on over! it's the Cordays' cat . No longer getting into the bulk. You never liked anyone stepping on your flowerbeds. Nobody likes it. Why would gardeners like it? You should take some rest You haven't stopped all day. He has a visitor. I thought I heard a car arrive. Probably another woman. Nope. It's his ex-wife. You know, the girl's mother the one who was kidnapped. And killed. Come, drink your tea or it will cool down. And think that they dared to accuse me! The daughter of a judge! They didn't accuse you they suspected you, it's different. You were questioned, as were all those who knew the girl. it's normal. And you were declared innocent. You know, Guillaume, that girl had beautiful eyes. Laughing, malicious. Just like our mother, when Dad was gone. The voice in the basement was of Garance, I could swear. - Someone is trying to scare you. - Maybe you? Then who? - Who can do that? - There are pervese people all around. And many know our story. The old owl nextdoor, David, Lucy ... ah, sorry! You make me talk nonsense. Nothing will bring Lili back If only I hadn't left her alone ... They knocked you down, you couldn't have done anything. I had left her to look for an animal which didn't exist. Me and my taste for illusions. You know, sometimes I keep hearing that cry. It wasn't human. Garance's killing was premeditated. It could have happened anytime. That does not erase my remorse. I just wanted to keep you abreast. - We're going to kill you! - With this you'll forget everything! What do I do to meet you! I hate this bike! You can't be without me, huh? No, I wanted to see Caro about the story of the clown. I told me you saw clowns all over. - I don't see what it has to do with Pamela. - I'll come to that later. But the doll was Garance's. You recognized it. 3. 4. 5 00:28:02.310 --> 00:28:04.062 Well, that far away ... I hadrly saw it. Then come see it up close Look it her well, I'm sure you'll see my point. You always had a craze for safes It's not there anymore And last night, was it a collective hallucination? It was Garance's clown I'm sure I put it here! And the bouquet of black orchids in the grave? I returned the next day and it was gone. Remember what I told you about evil spirits? They are trying to enter homes uninvited. Nope, never let them enter! It's for me! - It's Garance. - Snow White lives with dwarfs. d-w-a-r-f-s, don't you believe me? It is what they dictated to me well, almost. I have to leave you, Mom just arrived. Okay Who was that? Garance, she asked me to kiss you - Do you know her number, where she lives? - No I don't. I just know that she lives in a wooden house. - Something happened? - Yes. Excuse me a moment. - Mélinda? - She has a new friend. She's 6, blonde, has blue eyes and is called Garance. - That name is fashionable since 10 years - She said ... - Doctor... - Just a moment. She says she lives in a wooden house and that her father is a painter. - Did she say that? - Yes. I'm scared and the clown is gone too. That's my fault. I threw it away. Why? I don't know... It seemed hideous I threw it in the street. Bravo, it was my only physical evidence. Perhaps it was Fidélia who left it on the bed. You don't believe me! And besides, you don't care. Garance wasn't your daughter. And I'm not Chris. I am only a second choice. - It was a beautiful funeral. - They have brought out a singer. - They have the money. - Yeah Lucy, how strange to see you in the church. Yes, in our business it's difficult to have a real clientele. - But we are open on Sundays. - me too but my customers aren't loyal and the loyal aren't good customers. Confess, the alms are no longer what they used to be! - And you, Caroline, how about you? - I'm fine - You're finally at peace. - What do you know about it? Dead or alive, we are always tormented. A mystery Well thanks for being increasingly opaque. If you need anything, I'm here. it's very long, go sit, I'll take care of the parents. I'm sorry, Gilles. - I hope Tom finds out who did this - Yes, it's very much his intention. For Pamela, dark as the memory. - aren't you feeling well? - No. I'm not well. Come out, It's suffocating here. Take the bouquet! Thank you, I'm better. Go on. You know I just came out of respect for Pamela's husband. - Did you know her? - No. I just remember that she was a rather nasty girl. I saw recently in a shop. - You knew her as a child? - She was a friend of my daughter. Do you have a daughter that age? - No, she died, he was 6 years old. - I didn't know, I Come, let's go for a walk. Please. My car is there. And you miss your daughter? I mean to say, the one who died Yes. Everyday. What scared you in the church? A bouquet of black orchids with a note: "For Pamela, dark as a souvenir. " it's not very tasteful. I think it what sent by Pamela's murderer. If he sent it better keep away. Yes, but what really terrified me is that I saw an identical bouquet in my daughter's grave And you think that the person who placed the bouquet on your daughter's grave has something to do with Pamela's death? And Garance's. She was also killed. - And the culprit? - They never found him. You never knew who it could be? No, Tina, no idea. Let's get out of here, please. What's the matter? We're near the site where my daughter disappeared. Excuse me. A house! They caught him, Tom! No, everything is fine. But what happened? Why do you follow me? I've been thinking. The bouquet shows that what happened to me is related to Pamela's death. - I already know it. - Do you know anything about the murder? Stabbed. By the back. The strange thing is that he burnt the garden, why? He didn't want Pamela's body to be destroyed. The fire is a symbolic act. I see Are you the murderer? Hey listen, she got on my nerves, but not to this extent. And th ebouquet? Didn't you bring it? I had asked you to. I could not... And the card? It was written by a child. Stop it with the kids! And what of "Dark as the memory" Can a child write that? Children copy everything. Garance had a cat. Leopold. When he died, Chris buried and laid flowers on his tomb. And he told Garance: "We will put flowers every year to prove We don't forget him." - Orchids. - Garance ... We'll put flowers lest we forget. Caroline, stop it! You are playing into a crazy game, you'll go bonkers. You have to breathe better. Lucy will help you get a change of air. Yes, I love change. And the blonde girl from school, I dreamed that too? I got it. I'll manage it alone! You come? She's right, Why you don't go search that little girl? Don't say that. There are five inspectors investigating all day, more or less. I'll wait in the car. In addition there are thousands of girls blondes, but only one pretty brunette in this city. Not this one. Come, come. Georges, we must find Pamela's grave. I need that bouquet And the card for Tom. Come, come. Come, look. Georges! Come. The bouquet has to be here. Georges, come here! We're going home! Georges, come right now! I thought this was non-smoking area. The police are above the law. What are you thinking about? About Caroline. - But just as police. - Fair enough. You notice that you've never had to report a theft in miniskirt. I can't bring myself to believe her. I saw the bouquet on Garance's tomb and the doll too. I can't believe it's the same doll. The murderer might have preserved it all these years But why wait so long? Garance was 6 years old when she died? And Mélinda? How old is she? Six years. Do you think that she's in danger? I don't know. What are you going to do? Start from scratch. From Garance's abduction. I'll reopen the Corday case files Fuck... Hello? Caroline, stay calm. Don't move and close the door. I'm coming I get it, You've been terrified. Calm down, okay? - What happened? - I was watching TV, I heard a car ... - What car, remember the color? - No, dark. I ran ... The car was far and I got hit on head. - And then in the gut. - A second hit? I think it was someone small - Or someone taller but crouching? - No idea. Now rest yourself, everything will be fine. Take him. I just heard - Is it serious? - No, but I can't say that about me. - How so - I told you Garance has returned. The dead don't return, Caroline. They are fine with God. And what do you know if they are with him? What if they were in a infinite place, icy, dark, where they shouted in silence? And if they felt hatred and only thought more of revenge? Calm down. If Garance has not returned, Who is persecuting me? My poor husband,suspects Garance's father ... He loves you - So it's her. She needs me and she is saying it. - Don't blaspheme more! Only Jesus has returned from the dead. Then pray to him to help me. Five hundred francs, tonight at my house, okay? He must have missed the police, He began drinking to leave when he quit. 15 years ago, when closed the Corday case Garance, you remember? Yes and it's curious, he never closed them, He was a good cop. Until his wife left. A good cop who couldn't find the murderer. A dog happy that he came across a bone. Did no one find it strange that a cop like him closed the case? No, because nobody found anything. And why leave the police? His wife had left him, he also had to leave something. How does he get by? No idea, but lives better than me. Perhaps he had inherited something. Hi, how are you? I'm from the home inspector Jerome. Another brat. The Corday case, little Garance Did you hide any clues? I didn't hide anything. Can I pee? Why did you let go of the track with Geneviève Longville? I was to follow her. I received anonymous letters. - But she had an alibi. - I know, I read your report. Hello? No, wait. What you forgot to say in your report is that the alibi was given by a former employee of the house who then got an apartment herself. - Case closed officially. - Alright And you leave the police and opens a firm of detectives right away. With what money? I am a saver. You are not? I talk to you like a colleague and you answer like a client. Hello? Don't touch anything, I'll be there. Goodbye, colleague, until next time! Tina, what happened? - She was attacked in the basement. - Where I heard Garance for first time. Yes, I know. - Did you see anyone? - No I heard noise and I went to see. I got a blow on the head. I fell and when I got up there was no one. - He must have fled from behind. - He or she. Any news? I met the investigator who handled the case. He's hiding something, I'll make him talk. What do you want? Tom called me. I was asked many questions about Garance's abduction. Yes, I know, He has reopened the case. Why, Caroline? To understand! I will never let it go! But I want to forget! I have the right! Then come, a good whiskey ice, there's nothing better! Me too A certain Garance called me What? What? 6 o'clock 00:44:54.630 --> 00:44:56.268 Who called you? A girl's voice. It was Garance's, I could swear. It asked me for help and threatened me at the same time I have spent two days without sleeping a wink. Are you ready to testify to the police? I am ready to declare it to the devil. But would they believe a drunk? You know, I'm not an easy girl. If you have picked me up it's because I wanted to. Amazing. A real caravan. Ony a couch is missing in your empire - Where did you find this? - What? This clown. Where did you find it? But it was in the bed, it's the first time I've seen it You carried it in this bag, right? You left it on the bed when I was... - I've never seen it! - Liar. The door wasn't locked, anyone could have entered. You brought it, didn't you? You are crazy! I'm out! Don't touch that car! Help! Help! Caro, don't let David know how upset you are. - Is it prohibited? - No, adviced Thanks for staying. And Chris? He got it on the shoulder but it's not serious. You can go in. Thank you. What, another jealous friend? No How do you know her? - I was with her at a party. - There are cuckolds of all kinds. To kiss my conquest I saw the clown in bed. - Garance's. - it's impossible! Why? - Caroline also found him. - And after that? I yelled at the girl. She didn't like and left. I followed her and they fired at me. Where is the clown? In my house. Everything is related with the death of Garance. Can you take care of Lucifer until my return? A cat is an ordeal for a decorator. Hair on the carpet, scratches the chairs, but ... He will be less in danger with her dog than me. I'll take care of him. With Georges and Greg, my place is already a zoo, so... It's nothing. A nightmare. - Thank you! - On time. I was taken by surprise. - Pamela Gordon was practicing, right? - She used to come to the church. You would have heard her confess then? Hope you won't ask me to betray the seal of confession? No, I am not going to. If we don't exstablish a link between Pamela and Garance there might be another victim. Go to the library and read "The witness," by Gordon Pamelier. it's the pseudonym Pamela Gordon. Father, have you been ever in love? You took me into your car to ask that? I'm with a woman amazes me every day. She's divine, smells good, is ... - Do you have fire? - Yes "The witness" by Gordon Pamelier, When it was published? Two years ago. - Thank you. - You are welcome. - I just took a big step. - Not me I investigate these kids and they believe that it's for the TV and want a prize. Pamela had seen Garance tied in the car. She never said anything then but wrote it all down here. And where do you live? - Why is it locked? - Police Order. - And the children? - They've gone home. - Where is Mélinda? - There was a bomb scare at school. I went to look for her. - And Greg is back? - Yes. Thank you. - Did you fought with your father again? - I'm like a cockroach here He's around just for Mélinda He doesn't care about me It's not true, He's a bit awkward but he loves you. Be nice to him, if you love me a little. - Garance, give it to mom. - Give that to me! Hi Mom, are you sad because Dad is hurt? Who are you? What do you want? Oops! Did you live in this house of jeans? How do you know it? Your first husband lived in this wooden house, right? - Who told you that? - Garance. What is it with you during the past few days? - Can I see Inspector Tom? - Just a moment. Mom... I researched. And I found a picture of you in a white dress and flowers in her hair. From the hand of a handsome lord. Since it wasn't Dad, I asked Greg and he told me everything. Tell me, how is called your daughter who died? - Do they really cut off her head? - Did Greg tell you that? He says her name was Garence She has risen from the grave to get me. Your brother sees a lot of TV. But yes, I had a daughter and she was called Garance. - You can go - Thank you. My little princess! - Did you find something, boss? - Not yet, Commissioner. I'll get the cat. - The clown? - No clown here I talked to Garance, Mélinda's friend, it was her voice! - Sure? - Yes, and she spoke of the assault on Chris. How could she know? It has not come out in any newspaper. Oops! But what happened? What is this mess? - I'm Caroline Wahl, remember me? - Very well I was here for the cat, Chris was attacked the other day. I know. The girl came knocking to my house after the shooting. - Chris never had a phone. - Really? The girl said that when she was knocking, you didn't weren't sleeping Come Mélinda. What? I wasn't sleeping? And why? It also seems that you weren't alone. I was with my brother, Who else? - He's here? - No It is at a spa for a few days Does he have rheumatism? - Who are you? - Police. Inspector Jérôme. I take up the reins from Vasseur,who began the investigation. I'll never forget him. His research, interrogation, what horror! Have you seen him since? No What for? Who's there? But what is this? It can't be, Garance is dead. It can't be. It smells of gasoline! Guillaume! Your brother is in the hospital. Listen to me... I never wanted anyone's death. I just tried to fix things. - With Vasseur. - Who is Vasseur? who led the investigation. I'll tell you whatever you want, You'll know the truth. The truth! Vasseur ... He's a cop, a crook! I paid! Help! "Along the road, Christina looked inside the car. In the backseat, Jennifer , gagged, looked on pleadingly. Christina knew the driver of the car but hated Jennifer. Shee left without saying anything to anyone." So everyone's read this book except the cops? It released two years ago, 15 years after case was closed Genevieve told me about Longville, that she was suspected but had an alibi. - Yes, the daughter of a judge. - Yes, an obsessive puritan So the daughter went repressed repression gives rise to murderers. Do you think the old woman had read the book and was afraid? I'm not saying anything You're the cop. Shit, this is from Maurizier's! Look, it's full of knots, I'm screwed Not yet. Are you hungry? Sorry, I had an emergency. I saved the baby but not the mother. Yes, and the other night You had an emergency then too. You went to see Tom, drank, told nonsense, lies. I was downbeat I don't like liars. When you threw away the clown, Did you put in the bag or just placed it on top I left over, why? Do you think someone took it, someone watching the house? Yes, someone who calls Mélinda someone called Garance. By phone you can always play a recording. You don't talk with a recording, How could one know I was going to answer? Come here. You know that since all this began things have gotten awry Since you heard that voice, We don't touch us, We don't make love ... Forgive me. Together we have had two children ... I'm not Chris, but ... Leave Chris alone Are you happy, kitty? Caroline cares for you well? If I were a cat! You see? Chris Cat. She'd be taking care of me all day She'd me pampering me, caressing. But I'm not Chris, He is a formidable guy. Jack, do you remember the cruise Caroline made with her parents to Jamaica? Chris couldn't go. How was sad, the artist. So of course ... months later Lucy had come to the clinic, with a big belly. And a good quack helped her. Chris had refused a child And Lucy couldn't have more. Chris, no ... or Lucy. Yes, Lucy and Chris, Chris and Lucy. Lucy loves Chris. Like you. Forever. Now do you feel better? Are you okay? Yes. Garance was kidnapped months later. By whom? Maybe Lucy? Victor, roll the hose! Wrap the hose! Have you seen the castle? The fire has been cleaned up. Purified, perhaps. I don't think the intentions of the arsonist were pure. It was a clean work. They found the old woman tied to the bed. I have something to tell you. - Does it hurt? Can you keep painting? - But yes. The one who shot me didn't intend to kill me. He kept shooting at the house even after he shot me I wanted to let off steam, give loose rein to his rage, not kill me. You think like Lucy. A jealous husband. Jealous husbands don't leave clowns. Do you think it could be Garance's murderer? Yes. You should leave the city and go to your family What for? He'll find us. He Wants Melinda. Yes, but he won't get her. What does it matter to you? You're not responsible for my daughter. - So that's what you mean? - No, it's not that. I want to tell you that I know everything about Lucy and you. You'll never forgive me. Right, Lili?
