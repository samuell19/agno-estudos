(prisoners chattering) (ominous music) (prisoners chattering) - Hey. - Kill him! (prisoners shouting) - Somebody! (prisoners shouting) (suspenseful music) (prisoner cries out) (prisoners chattering) - I think it was half a minute. - [Prisoner] You owe me, man. 10 to one, you owe me! (prisoner gurgling) - [Prisoner] That's it, game over. - [Prisoner] Oh man. - [Prisoner] Better than the fight we saw last night, that's for sure. - [Prisoner] Hey man, ew! Aw, man. - [Prisoner] And we have a winner. (suspenseful music) (prisoners chattering) - What's he doin'? - Hey, what's happenin'? (ominous music) - Anybody else want a cigarette? - Sweet. - Oh yeah, let's get outta here. - I didn't think so. (prisoners chattering) - All right. - [Prisoner] Enjoy your 10 bucks. (suspenseful music) (Adrian cries out) (alarm blaring) - [Guard On Loud Speaker] Security, Lunar Maintenance 4. Send security team to Lunar Maintenance 4. (alarm blaring) (Adrian grunts) (alarm blaring) (machine beeping) - [Computer] Tachycardia, heart rate 210 bpms and rising. (Adrian groaning) KBS 13 milligrams. - What's in this guy? - [Computer] EEG negative. (Adrian grunting) EKG negative. CVBS negative. All life signs negative. - Paddles. Clear. (paddles zapping) Clear. (paddles zapping) Clear. (paddles zapping) Clear. (paddles zapping) Clear. (paddles zapping) Clear. (paddles zapping) Clear. (paddles zapping) Bag him, he's dead meat. (elevator whirring) - [Man] What you got? - [Guard] A couple of stiffs from Labor 4 for the boss coroner at Logan. - [Man] Okay, that's Shuttle 3B, Bay 6. (elevator whirring) - [Pilot] Lunar Control, this is Shuttle 3B. All systems green for takeoff. - [Controller] Copy, 3B, stand by. 10, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three two, one, ignition. - [Co-Pilot] Warmin' up in Boston today? - [Pilot] Eh, no way. It's snowin' again of course. - [Co-Pilot] Damn, I thought we were flyin' to Mexico. - [Pilot] What's the difference? There's snow everywhere these days. Well, there's our Earth, the big brown marble. 100% dust covered, perpetual night. (ominous music) Catch the news on GX last night? - [Co-Pilot] Who watches that crap? - [Pilot] They say the explosion was caused by that volcanic diamond unit off Hoiku, Japan. - [Co-Pilot] What is it, another month before the dust starts to lift? (suspenseful music) - [Automated Voice] Lunar Shuttle 3B arriving Cargo Concourse 3. - [Reporter] How's your drive home tonight, Boston? Those circadian daylights are shutting down a little-- (floor waxer whirring) (bag crackling) (suspenseful music) (Adrian grunting) (Adrian sniffing) (Adrian sniffing) - [Casper] What's that? - What do you think it is, you little shrimp? You think I'm gonna come to a meeting with you without bringin' somethin'? - (chuckles) No deal. - Hey, yo, get real. I'm tired and I'm really not in the mood for your shtick. So get back over here. Closer. Let's see what you brought to the party, huh? Anything up your sleeve there? - Who are you really? - I'm the guy that's gonna make that pink puss of yours real happy if you got what I want. - Oh, I have it. - Really? - Casper sees everything, hears everything, and knows even more. What you want is right in (device zaps) here! That's it, take him down! Kick his butt! Turn him over! Turn him over, man, that's it! Kick his butt! (Cameron grunting) Kick him down, man. Huh, who you callin' shrimp? That's it, take the gun. Do it, do him, do him in! Time for some extra payback, Grayson. (laughs) (Cameron groans) To your mom! Come on, let's go. (bone cracks) (henchman cries out) Let's move. (henchman groaning) (gun firing) - (sniffles) I can't remember anything else. Just that face, red and sick looking. And his smell. Like something rotten. - Good, got it all recorded on the Pippin, Tricia. Now you're gonna help us draw a picture of the assailant. Just relax and look at the big screen in front of you. (computer beeping) I'm starting the program. Don't be scared. SIS is gonna read your subliminal reactions to the facial features of the man who attacked you. Which part of his face do you remember best? - His eyes, definitely his eyes. - All right, touch the screen where it says eyes. (computer beeping) - No, those are nothing like him. His eyes were red. - Just keep looking at the screen. Empty your mind, let the images go by. Relax your face. SIS is reading your micromuscular responses. (computer beeping) (suspenseful music) (Tricia gasps) - It's him! - [Officer] Okay, excellent, Tricia. - Hey Mitchell. - Now we're going to look at some other facial features. - Look into this for me, would ya, please? - [Mitchell] All right, thanks a lot. - [Officer] Touch nose on the screen. You're doing just fine. Relax, you're going to help us catch your assailant. (hand pounding) - Yeah? Grayson, how'd it go? - Peachy. - Yeah, what about the money? You bring in Casper? - More fun to let him be out there. I can hardly wait to see his face, though, when he finds out all that toilet paper (chuckles) inside his money belt. - But Grayson, you were supposed to bring him in. Get back out there. - Oh I'm sorry, but I'm takin' a break. You're chief of detectives, Captain. Why don't you send one of your guys up to mop up? - No way, Grayson. - Lankett, it's the econight, man. (sighs) It's gettin' to me. I'm tired, I can't sleep. - Hey Jack, we're all tired. It doesn't get you out of this case. - Black Shield prerogative, Captain. By the way, two of Casper's are out there bleedin' on city property, so you should send a garbage truck. - Friggin' Black Shield. - Just relax. You're doing fine. (suspenseful music) Relax your face. Don't be scared. - That's his mouth. - That's good, that's all we need. Now we can assemble a picture. (computer beeping) - That's him. I'm positive, it's him. (sirens blaring) (suspenseful music) (man grunts) (neck cracks) (knuckles tapping) (computer beeping) (phone beeping) - Not tonight, Liam, I'm beat. - Dr. Younger? - Yeah. I'm sorry, just a moment. (phone beeping) - [Dr. Underwood] I'm sorry to disturb you, Dr. Younger. This is Dr. Underwood at Boston PD. The health department gave me your name as the head of microbiology at the Lady of Mercy? - [Kirbie] What can I do for you, Doctor? - Well, I have a rape victim and the semen and blood samples of her assailant are turning out some very odd readings. Could you come down to the lab? - Tonight? - Please. - I've been on my feet for 18 hours. Can't it wait until-- - No. - What is it? - I was hopin' you could tell me. (suspenseful music) - I'm on my way. - Detective Grayson? - Yeah. - [Man] I've been waiting for a week. I don't care what your excuse is. I want a darned apology. (officers chattering) Do I have to come there and do your job? I don't care. - What do you want? - I'm assigning myself a new case. - What's the matter, holiday flights all booked up? - No, my date canceled. Now talk to me about Adrian Dunn. - Dunn? - Collins pulled up this picture on the SIS terminal last night. - So what's this got to do with Dunn? - That is Dunn! - Aw come on, Grayson. - Listen, some rape case IDed him last night. - It can't be Dunn, he's dead. - It's Dunn. He's sick, he's freaked up, but he's Dunn. - Dunn died at Lunar Labor 4 three days ago. - Then how come his body bag come up empty at Logan Lunar last night? - You leave it alone, Grayson and that is a direct order. Don't you gimme that Black Shield crap again. - My right, Captain. I'm assigning myself. - I hate this aggravating circadian daylights. Listen, I'm handling this rape case myself, all right? The victim is locked up in an iso ward over at Lady of Mercy with some weirdo virus the doctors have never even heard about. - I could give two shakes. I wanna know about Dunn. - Trust me, Grayson, it isn't Dunn. He was DOA at Lunar Med. The guards, the attending doctors, everbody and his mother's lousy dog pronounced him dead. - Don't you think it's kinda odd that the SIS would pull up his picture? - Oh, so somebody screwed up at Logan. His body'll turn up in Cincinnati tomorrow and mystery solved. - Okay, who's the rape case? - (chuckles) My case, stay away. - I wanna talk to her. - Screw you. - Fine, you handle the rape case, I'll take the Dunn case. - Hey, there is no friggin' Dunn case! - There is now! (ominous music) (Tricia grunting) - [Kirbie] Can I help you? - What's wrong with her? - Who are you? (Tricia grunting) - Why is she in isolation, she gonna die? - Captain Lankett didn't mention your name, Officer... - Oh, Detective Grayson, Cameron Grayson. I need to talk to her. - She's under heavy sedation and I can't let you in anyway right now. This case is just, let's start again. Who are you exactly? - Listen, when will she be able to-- - All right, that's it. I don't know who you are and that's the last non-answer you're giving me. Yes, Captain Lankett? This is Dr. Younger at Lady of Mercy. There's a man here who says he's, never mind. (suspenseful music) (Adrian gasps) (Adrian gurgling) (door buzzes) - Just forget the stun stick. I need a room. (laser whirring) - Why don't go back to Little Beirut and kill yourself a couple more punks? - 'Cause I'm cleared for evidence rooms, that's why. - (chuckles) Yeah, well you're bettin' on the wrong horse, pal. Come on, really. You don't really believe that Dunn was ever in this bag? - I think anything's possible, Lankett. After all, you made captain. (laughs) - [Nurse On Loud Speaker] Dr. Vermais, please report to Psychiatry, Dr. Vermais. (Cameron clears throat) - What is it? Is she in danger? What the hell are you doing in here? Get out. - Shield your eyes, I'm gonna turn the light on. Listen, there's some questions about Tricia Rollins I just have to have answers to. - (scoffs) Are you in the habit of just walking into people's bedrooms in the middle of the night? - It's five o'clock in the afternoon. It's the econight. Don't feel bad, everybody's confused. - I don't feel bad. You're trespassing on hospital property, and my privacy. Now I have been told that Captain Lankett is in charge of this case, so-- - Well I'm sure you've figured out by now that Captain Lankett couldn't fall of a cliff if someone pushed him. - [Nurse On Loud Speaker] Dr. Evans, line four. - But you do have a nice smile. Sense of humor. (soft bright music) How 'bout an early dinner? I really need your help on this case. I know a nice quiet spot. (crowd chattering) - [Merchant] Fresh bowl. Hot chowder. Chowder. Blue fish. Chowder, chowder. (crowd chattering) Blue fish. - You got change? - Fresh blue fish. (crowd chattering) - Hey, boss, gimme a couple of those, will ya? Yeah, two. Thank you. Yeah, there you go. - [Kirbie] Black Shield unit? - Oh, elite unit. Assign ourselves, break all the rules, solve all the big cases. - Hm, sounds like a cop's wet dream. - Not at all. Latest in police science. Some brain at Harvard invented the concept. - Ah, and your degree is in what, harassment? - You betcha, PhD. Now didn't I see you in the rudeness class? - Touche. So, what do you need to know from me, Detective? (crowd chattering) - Blue fish! - Why don't you tell me everything you know about the rape victim, Tricia Rollins. - Tell me something, why did you assign yourself to this case? - It's personal. - You know the victim? - Know the assailant. Now let me interview Tricia. - She's in full medical quarantine. No one in the world sees her without my okay. Then you've probably already tried, huh? Is that why you invited me to dinner? - Why is she in quarantine? - [Merchant] Cold pizza up here. Cold pizza, we got hot dogs here. - She's contracted an unknown virus. - Unknown? - And extremely dangerous. We don't know its nature, how it's transmitted, or even its ultimate effect. I've sent samples to UMIDS virology for analysis. - Did the rapist give it to her? - Possibly. Sexual transmission is unlikely, but it's just too soon to call. Listen, I need to know everything that you can tell me about the assailant. - It's classified, sorry. Hey, charming sunset, huh? You hear the rumor that the sky is starting to lighten in the South Pole? - Thank you for the charming company and the illuminating conversation, but I have to get back to work. - Yeah. (somber music) Wait, wait, wait, please! Thank you. (crowd chattering) - [Customer] 16 fish sticks. - [Merchant] 16 fish sticks, fry 'em up, Frank. Frank, fry 'em now quickly. (Adrian grunting) (suspenseful music) (ominous music) (Adrian cries out) (furniture clattering) - [Man] Hey! Hey, what the hell are doin' nextdoor? Keep the noise down. (fist banging) Hey! Nextdoor, hey! (fist banging) (Adrian groaning) (fist banging) (Adrian grunting) (glass breaking) (prostitute laughing) (ominous music) (customer murmuring) (Adrian sniffing) - [Prostitute] Come on, come on, man. (Adrian sniffing) Come on. I'll take the money, if ya don't mind. - [Customer] There ya go. - Here we go. (Adrian sniffing) - [Customer] You mean, right here? - Doesn't bother me. (prostitute whimpers) (suspenseful music) (customer gurgling) (Adrian cries out) Don't, you freak. (whimpering) No please, no please! (whimpering) Oh God, wait, wait, wait, please. No wait, wait, wait. Wait, wait! - [Adrian] Please. - God. - Katie. - What? - Don't do it. - Let me go, let me go, I'm not Katie. Let me go, please. (Adrian sniffing) I'm not Katie. - Not Katie. - Let me go. Okay? - Not Katie. - Okay. (Adrian sniffing) - Not Katie. - God. Oh God. - Not Katie! Not Katie! (neck cracks) (keyboard clicking) (computer beeping) (somber music) (computer beeping) - Detective Grayson. - Yeah. - You requested a 412 on violent rape. - Yeah. - I've got a list for the last 48 hours. - Put it into my Pippin. - And patrol unit 22-4 called in a possible about five minutes ago. They're reporting to the scene. - Put that location through to my Pippin, too, now. (dramatic music) - [Woman] Hey, what's going on? - [Woman] We can't get through. Think there was an accident. (women chattering) (officers chattering) - Yo, Bobby, what's that building over there? - [Bobby] Ah, it's a cheapo hotel. (hand thuds) (Cameron whistles) - What room? Officer, send forensics up to 417. (suspenseful music) - Detective Grayson, you're really startin' to piss me off. This is my case! - Well why don't ya try doin' your job? Excuse me. - Fingerprint the whole room, top to bottom. You, I want the badge number of the guy that let that animal in here. (suspenseful music) - Hey, where's Dr. Younger? - Behind you. - Dr. Delhan, line two. Dr. Delhan, line two. - [Cameron] What's goin' on here? - They called a little after I got back to the hotel. Tricia's being transferred to UMIDS' new iso med ward. - [Cameron] Why? - You can give me a lift over there. (suspenseful music) When it's completed, this is gonna be the biggest virology unit in the country, bigger than Atlanta. - Do you work here? - I've been offered a job. I haven't decided. (knuckles tapping) Is there a doctor in the house? - [Gene] Kirbie. Look at you. - [Kirbie] Good to see you. - So, still sending me all the tough ones, huh? Why don't you just take the job here, then I could officially do all your work and thinking for you. - This charming fascist was my boss back in Atlanta. This is Cameron Grayson, Detective. - Gene Washington, scientist extraordinaire. - Hey. - Have a seat. Kirbie here is a decent microbiologist, but lousy friend. I know you're in town, so how come you haven't called me? - Well, I've been busy, you know how it is. (Gene grunts) So, where have you put Rollins? - Unit 1. We're working up an MRI NA scan and doing a microbiopsy on her tumors. That's what we've got so far. - Thanks. - Doctor, I'd like to talk to her. - [Gene] Only if you're telepathic. - Detective Grayson's not aware that she's in a coma, Gene. - (chuckles) I stand admonished. I'll take you down to unit one. At least you can see Tricia Rollins for yourself. - [Cameron] Thanks. - We monitor unit one from here. This way to the observation deck. (Tricia wheezing) - [Kirbie] She's developed tumorous masses along her face, breasts, and stomach. - Oh my Lord. (Tricia wheezing) Is it cancer? - Ya know, I wish it was that simple. She's exhaling a mixture of CO2 with traces of CH4. Don't anyone light a cigarette near her, or smell her breath for that matter. - Wait a second, are you two tellin' me that she's exhaling methane gas? - Oh remarkable, Detective. Are you a scientist as well? (Tricia wheezing) We'll learn more from the biopsies. - [Cameron] How contagious is she? - Very good question. The virus is clearly infectious. Casual contact seems safe enough, but I wouldn't bet the mortgage on it. Well, I better go downstairs and kick some lab butt, huh? I'll buzz you when I've got something. - All right. - Nice meeting you, Detective. - Yeah, you too. Do you do DNA testing here? - Yeah, why? (Tricia wheezing) It's this way. - So where are we goin'? - Just follow me. Where did you collect this nail? - Hotel room near where a hooker and a customer were murdered. - [Kirbie] Okay, this way. - [Cameron] Nope, I gotta go. - [Kirbie] Well wait, wait. - Huh? - Wait. - The hooker. - Yeah. - Was she-- - The preliminary coroner's report said no sexual contact. - [Kirbie] But you think that she was killed by the man that we're looking for. - Well I'll know that when you get those tests back to me. - Thanks for dinner last night. I'm sorry I had to rush off. - Ah, you were right about the sushi anyway, huh? (soft music) - God. (tires screech) (upbeat music) - Tuesday, Rollo? - Yeah, yeah. - [Casper] My cheek is starting to hurt. I said my cheek is starting to hurt. Give me some water, man! Hey! - Handsome, sweetheart. Ooh. Yeah, have a little trouble with the money bills, huh? Ya know what they say about payback, don't ya? I gotta tell ya, I got a big problem with folks that can't keep up their end of the bargain. So let us get the rules straight to this particular encounter. I ask, you answer. Or... Ooh yeah. - No. No. You bully! (Casper whimpering) No, please. - Well, maybe not as artistic you as hoped for but - My face. - I like it. - [Casper] Oh. - I'm lookin' for somebody has been raping women in this part of town. - So? - So, so you tell them that there's a big juicy reward out for him. - And just how am I supposed to pay off, Judge? - I oughta tell you, you find the guy and I'll provide the money. In the meantime, ever seen one of these? It's real interesting. It's called a keeper. It's illegal now, something about being cruel and unusual punishment. In about 36 hours it's gonna shock ya to unconsciousness. (Casper groaning) Every hour on the hour until I deactivate it. Why, it might even scramble what little brains you got left, Casper, huh? Well, better get it in gear, sweetheart. I'd hate to think what the neoravers will do to that pink puss if they find ya layin' unconscious in the gutter. Ooh. (tongue clicking) - Oh man. Ow. Ow. Oh man. Oh. (glass breaking) (Tricia wheezing) (machines beeping) - Get me some geo-lidocaine. (Tricia wheezing) Hold her down. (Tricia wheezing) (alarm blaring) (Tricia gasps) (machine beeping) Her heart stopped. Get the paddles. (suspenseful music) Clear. Clear, do it. (Tricia gasping) - Get outta here! Go! (screams) Everybody in the decom! Iso 2, pressure suits. Get outta here, go! (alarm blaring) (suspenseful music) - [Kirbie] What happened? Who's in there? (computer beeps) Oh my God. - Wouldn't you know it? You've always said haste makes waste. Oh well, I guess I'm becoming a microbiologist's dream, and nightmare. I'm becoming my own work. (chuckles) (somber music) - Wake up, wake up. You know this guy? - [Boy] No. - [Casper] You ever see him before? - No, I've never seen him. - Don't raise your voice at me. You sure? - Yes. - Keep your eyes open for him. Ya hear me? - Get your light sticks now, everybody. (upbeat dance music) Come on. Step right up, step up. Come on, get your light sticks. Get your light sticks, any color. Red, green, blue, any color. Every color is magical, isn't it? Come on, everybody, step right up. Step up, get your lights today. Hey, how about you? Hey, how about you? Hey, lady over in the yellow coat. Hey, come on, get your light sticks right here. Step right up. Hey, ya just got a little green light. I can get you a blue one, an orange one, a green one, a yellow one. What do you want, come on? A couple bucks, come on. Hey, how 'bout you, man? How 'bout. - You seen this guy here? - No. - You sure? - Never seen him before. Hey, how 'bout you? Hey, how 'bout you, ma'am? Step right up, in the red coat, come on. You wanna see what I can do with these light sticks. Little bit of jugglin' for your eyes. Little bit of green, orange, blue light sticks, come on. Step right up, step right up, get your lights. How 'bout you, ma'am? I see ya smilin', come on. (phone ringing) - Ah. Grayson. What's wrong? - We've had an incident in Unit 1. That's not why I called. - You look awful. - Thanks. You look like junk, too. Listen, our genetics lab got some good DNA off that nail you found. - You got a match? - Well, they're feeding the results into the police computer access you gave us. It shouldn't be long now. - I'll be right down. Don't rush, I'm not going anywhere. - You okay, Kirbie? (phone beeping) (partiers chattering) (somber music) - [Partier] It's not over here. (soft suspenseful music) (Adrian sniffing) (faucet squeaks) (faucet gurgles) - [Adrian] Thirsty. Always so thirsty. And I have to go get something to drink. You stay here. Okay, you'll be safe. You stay here. I'll be back. - Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, I gotta tell ya, you look good in a spacesuit. - Don't kid around, okay? I'm really not in the mood. - Well why don't ya tell me what's goin' on? - Plenty. There's been a breach in Iso Unit 1. (computer beeping) Does the name Adrian Dunn mean anything to you? - Are you sure? - [Kirbie] Yeah, who is he? - That's who he is. Kirbie, did Tricia Rollins say anything about a Katie McConnell? - Yeah, yeah she did. What is it, Cameron? - Nothin'. - Don't shrug me off. What do you know about Adrian Dunn? - I told you everything I know. - No, you know more. Do you know where he's been recently? Has he traveled? - He's been in jail. - Where? - On the moon. (computer chiming) - Sorry to disturb you. I know it's important to bond before you sleep together, but do you have to do it in my old office? - Charming as always. - Is he infected? - See, he's surprised to hear that you're even interested. - No I'm not. - (chuckles) Ooh, I like him. Make sure you do sleep with him, Kirbie. - Look, stop it, both of you, okay? This isn't funny. - Listen, you two need me out there findin' Dunn, eh? - Detective, when you get out there if ya see the pizza boy, ask him if he'll deliver in here. I tip real good. - I'll get that pizza for ya. (Gene chuckles) (suspenseful music) (woman grunting) (hand smacks) - [Adrian] Lie, lie, lie. You promised to wait for me. It's okay. We go home now, my love. (woman groans) - Hey Joe, listen, run a couple more units down to Little Beirut. Just a hunch I got. (phone ringing) Thanks. - [Casper] Grayson. - Hello, Casper. (chuckles) - [Casper] I found Dunn for you. - Okay, put it up. Now introduce the virus. (computer beeping) Son of a bitch. That is one smart virus. It rejected the monoclonal antibody, went straight for the real one. Whatever design, this has my admiration. - Well, that eliminates an ionic solution. What next? - Those little buggers are tryin' to break loose, change the Earth's biosphere. Hundred years from now, maybe less. You've got a ready made planet for whatever breathes methane, terraforming. It's an old concept, really. Changing a planet to suit the needs of your species without direct confrontation. (somber music) Those little green guys are probably on their way now. See? And you thought all those diplomas on the wall were fakes. - It's probably 'cause they were done in crayon. - [Casper] Yo, here! - Let's see. Where is he? - My boy says he's upstairs somewhere, about halfway, right side. Hey yo, Judge, wait a minute. Aren't you forgettin' two things? - Nah, I'll take the collar off and give you the money when I see what I wanna see. (Casper hoots) (suspenseful music) - All the world will die except for us, and for our babies. - I'm not Katie. Let me go. - What did you say? (woman crying) What did you say? - [Woman] Don't. (crying) - [Adrian] Did you say? - [Woman] No, don't. (crying) - What did you say? (Adrian sniffing) (suspenseful music) (Adrian sniffing) Cameron! I smell you! (sniffs) (soft suspenseful music) (Chichi grunts) (suspenseful music) (gun fires) - [Chichi] Yo, I got him, man! (gurgling) - Who's got who, sweet baby? - Who the hell are you, man? He's in here! (Adrian sniffs) (gun fires) (glass breaks) (gun fires) - This one's for Katie. (Casper grunts) (gun fires) - Screw you, Judge. You ain't leaving this building. Chichi, come here. Go on. One, two, three. (guns firing) Come on, window. (footsteps tapping) (gun fires) (guns firing) (guns firing) (Cameron gasps) - Allow me, sir. (guns firing) (Adrian grunts) - Who the hell is this guy? (guns firing) (Casper cries out) (gun fires) (Chichi grunts) - Cammie! My dear old friend. Your turn. (siren blaring) (somber music) - I'm not your friend. (gun fires) (suspenseful music) - [Officer] Put down your weapons, lie flat. - I'm a cop. I'm a cop, damn it! - Yeah, what's your story, sunshine? - Grayson, Black Shield. - Yeah, and I'm Gumby, pleased to meet you. - Listen, he's infected with a virus, don't touch him. - What kind of virus? - I don't know, call Doctor-- - Listen, what that guy looks like to me is dead. It looks like you capped him. - I'm tellin' you, don't touch him. - Keep him quiet, please. - [Cameron] Don't touch him! I'm tellin' you, don't-- - Keep quiet! (Cameron grunts) - He's got a pulse, weak. We need medics. - All right, let's check out I'm a cop's story. Call sky bike for transport to Lady of Mercy. They got a security wing. Let's go. - Come on, get your hands off me, man. I'll call Precinct 14. Come on, I used to be a cop just like you. - Captain Lankett, got a certain Grayson here. - Let me see him. - Come on. - Yes, sir. - Come on. - Let him go. - Yeah, that's him. So you made some new friends, I see. - Dunn's on his way to Lady of Mercy. You gotta reroute him to UMIDS Infectious Disease Center now. - Dunn? - Yeah, Dunn. He's not in Cincinnati, Lankett. He's here and he's turned, he's turned into I don't know what. - Come on, slow down, start again. He's turned into what? - Damn it, Lankett, stop acting like a parrot and get him down to UMIDS now. I'll meet ya there. (somber music) - [Automated Voice] Hospital circadian lighting is on. It is daytime. - I don't believe this. Who told you to admit them? - Dr. Younger, I was told UMIDS had refused them. Captain Lankett ordered 'em put under guard here. They're both in iso. - Kirbie, what's goin' on? Why isn't Dunn at UMIDS? - Don't ask. Somehow he was refused admittance there and sent here. - We were told you were under full medical quarantine. What did you want me to do, let him die? - Listen, I've fired more ammunition into Dunn than most cops do in an entire career and he's still alive. Hey, hey, what the hell am I dealin' with? - Not hell, just outer space. - What? - They found a girl with him. - I know that. - She's here, too, she's infected. She hasn't exploded yet. - She hasn't what? - Look, I have two EVRUs on the way. I have to go check on the girl. You wait here for the EVRUs. Tell the unit techs that this is Level 4 Isolation. - [Cameron] 4 Isolation, wait, listen. - Get all these cops away from the ward. Iso suits only. - Whoa. If it's that dangerous, I don't want you near him either. - Look, I can handle myself. Just wait here for the EVRUs, all right? - EVRUs in four... Iso. Excuse me. I'm a cop. I'll just go in. (chuckles) I just love days like this. (men grunting) - Don't go in there. (doors bang) - Hey, hey, hey. - No! - [Scientist] He can't go in there, who does he think he is? (machine beeping) (suspenseful music) (officer grunting) (suspenseful music) (Adrian sniffing) (woman coughing) - Katie. Katie. (woman coughing) I'm lonely for you, Katie. (ominous music) - Is he in there? Sound the security alert, he's gone. (ominous music) (alarm blaring) - Katie. Beautiful, beautiful Katie, I missed you. Look, I changed. I can change you, too. Then we can be together again. (alarm blaring) We can be together forever and ever and ever! (dramatic music) (Cameron cries out) - Gimme that. Get outta here! (gun fires) (glass breaking) (alarm blaring) - You sure, you're okay? I mean, he didn't-- - No, no. I'm sure I'm okay. Anyway, even if he did infect me, at least we'd both be working on this from the inside out, right? (Gene chuckles) - Ya know somethin'? I never noticed this before, but you have the same sense of humor as I do. - Yeah well, see what a bad influence you are on me? (suspenseful music) How are you doing, Gene? - I've been better. I'll see you when you get here. - Yeah. - You okay? - [Kirbie] Yeah, you? - Dunn got away, just disappeared. We have 12 units out, though. We'll get him. Where are you goin'? - [Kirbie] I have to get back to UMIDS as soon as possible. - All right, then I'll drive ya. Besides, there's a few things I need to pick up on the way. - He called me Katie. (somber music) When are you gonna tell me who Katie is? - Eh, go on, go on get in there. What was that, sweetheart? Of course you can have all the light and water you want. Yeah. (grunting) (ominous music) - [Cameron] Come in. - So this is your place, huh? - Yeah, make yourself at home. Listen, I'll be right back, okay. (somber music) Hey Kirbie, give these a try. They're a little big, but... You can use my dining room. - Thanks. What's in the bag? - Light caliber weapons didn't seem to do much to Dunn. He won't be gettin' up next time. I'll be ready. - How ya gonna track him down? - My guess is he's in Little Beirut. Anyway, he's got a way of showin' up with no help from me. I'll be ready for him. It's you I'm worried about. - [Kirbie] Me? - Yeah. (somber music) - This is Katie, isn't it? She's your wife? Where is she? - She's dead. - I'm sorry. Do you wanna tell me what's going on? Please. Tell me what's going on. - Adrian Dunn was my best friend. - Your best friend? - Yeah. We went to the academy together. Katie was an ex-girlfriend of Adrian's. One time I met Katie, one thing led to another, we got married. Adrian never said much about it, kinda like it was taboo between us. Katie told me plenty about him, how violent he was. Anyway, two days after we got married Adrian came here. Katie was home alone. He beat her, he raped her. She never made it outta the hospital. - I'm so sorry. - So don't fall for me, I'm real bad news. - Hey, you're not blaming yourself, are you? - Me? Nah. Never saw it comin'. - Well anyway, don't worry about me. I'm not the marrying kind. - Good, me neither. Come on, we got better things to do. I gotta go down to Little Beirut. I'll drop you off at UMIDS. (somber music) - I look like Katie, don't I? - Yeah, ya do. - [Doctor] Tomorrow is too late. 10 minutes from now - We don't have any - is too late. - experience with this at all. - We gotta do something. - The last thing we need here is panic. - I couldn't agree more with you, Mr. Mayor. The virus is contained to-- - Oh come on! - We'll have a fix on its origin within 72 hours. - Contained? We got this Dunn character running around on the loose spreading a contained virus. And what happens if Dr. Younger's alien virus theory turns out to be right? We gotta nail the bastard now. - Dr. Young does not speak for UMIDS, Mr. Mayor. (phone chiming) - What ya doin', happiness? - It's your office, crying. - Mm, that's nice. Everyone should have a hobby. Meeting over? - The mayor wants to wait and see what happens. I get the sense he'd be glad if the virus just took over and destroyed all of Little Beirut. - Well he's up for reelection. - Cameron's down there. I'm worried about him. - He's good people, Kirbie. I like him. - Well that's saying something. You don't like anyone. - (chuckles) Except you. I've pocketed my data. Set your Pippin to record. I'll post-transmit it in. (computer beeping) This unit is solid steel. It won't even burn up the room nextdoor. (ominous music) - No, Gene, don't. Please. I'm coming down. - Bye, kid. (ominous music) (alarm blaring) - ISO Unit 1 burn down procedures engaged. Burn down lockup engaged. Virus known to station one. 10, nine, eight, seven, - You've been invited - six, - to a barbecue - five, four, - and your the main course. - three, two, one. (dramatic music) (flames hissing) (alarm blaring) (explosion booms) (alarm blaring) (liquid pattering) - Oh God. Oh God. - Katie. - [Kirbie] Don't. (elevator dings) Somebody help me! - [Adrian] Katie. - I'm Katie. I still love you, it's true. (phone beeps) - [Adrian] I love you, Katie. - We have to talk first. - [Adrian] I need you. - Hey, where's Dr. Younger? - Look, there's been a bacterial leak. Get an iso suit on if you're gonna wander around. (Kirbie cries out) (ominous music) (alarm blaring) - Have you seen, Doctor, sir. Where's Dr. Younger? - I don't know. - Come on! - She wasn't with us in that room. (dramatic music) - Katie! Katie, where are you? Can smell you, why you hiding? It Cammie? Don't love him, Katie, please! (suspenseful music) (Kirbie grunts) Don't. Don't love him. Don't love him. - I don't. - Love me. Love me. Love me! - Yes. (suspenseful music) - Oh my God. - This. - Katie. - This way, please. - Yes. - Now. - Yes, yes. - Let me undress for you. - Oh. Katie! (ominous music) Katie. Come back, Katie, I need you. I love you, Katie. Not Katie? Not Katie. You're not Katie! (Adrian sniffing) (forklift buzzes) (engine rumbling) (Adrian cries out) (Adrian cries out) (Kirbie grunts) (Kirbie cries out) (dramatic music) (Kirbie screaming) - Hold it, Dunn! - Don't be worried, Cam, it's a forger. She's not Katie. - Ow! - You get off her or I'm gonna blow you to hell. - Ah, careful, careful, careful partner, you're a lousy shot. - Cameron, don't shoot. He's pure methane inside, he'll blow. - Yeah, yeah, yeah! - No! - Blow it up, blow it up, blow it up! (gun fires) - (coughs) Kirbie! Kirbie! - [Kirbie] I'm okay, he's over there. Behind you. (gun fires) - You okay? - Yeah, I'm okay. Go get that son of a bitch. - Eat this, Dunn. (explosion booms) Stay here. (soft suspenseful music) - [Woman] What's going on? - [Man] Watch it. (Adrian cries out) - Seems like old times, Cammie, just me and you. (men grunting) (dramatic music) (electricity zaps) (men grunting) (laser zapping) (somber music) (Cameron wheezing) (Cameron cries out) (suspenseful music) Better this way. I'm doing you a favor. Believe me, old friend, you wouldn't much care for what this world is becoming. (Cameron grunting) You have to change to even breathe the air. (Cameron cries out) - Adrian, it's Katie. I want you, Adrian. Take me. - You're not our Katie. Our Katie is dead. - Who cares? I want you anyway. - Sorry, Adrian is very busy right now. - No, Adrian, I want you now. (laser humming) (Adrian screaming) (crowd gasps) - [Man] Yeah, somebody over there. (somber music) (Cameron chuckles) - Hey, how are ya? Lookin' good. - Thanks. - Hey, how's the hand? - [Cameron] It's okay. - Great. - What are you doin' there? - Packing up. - Why? - Well, I've been offered a position over at UMIDS. Gene's old job. - And you're gonna take it. - Yes. (somber music) - I think that's great. That's just what Gene would've wanted. - Yeah. - Yeah. - Say, how 'bout that dinner? I seem to remember this quiet little spot downtown that serves up probably some of the worst sushi I've ever had, but. (Cameron laughs) What do ya think? - Mind if I take a snowcheck? Why don't I give you a lift down to UMIDS? - Thanks, but actually they're sending a car over for me, so. - Well great. I gotta get back to work now. - Okay. - I guess I'll say goodbye for now, huh? - Yeah. (somber music) - Thanks, Kirbie. Bye. (upbeat electronic music)
