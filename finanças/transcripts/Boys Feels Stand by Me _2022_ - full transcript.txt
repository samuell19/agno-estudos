-- Subs corrected and resynced by darthfrede -- "The weather is nice today. The sky is blue." Very good. And it's true that the weather is nice today, isn't it? Nils. Nicolas. Come on, Nicolas, your turn. The next sentence, please. Wake up! It's Victor. Excuse me, Victor. The next sentence please? Shall we help our friend here? Sentence four. "I open the..." "...opened..."! Yes. "I opened the window to let the sunshine in." Very good. Next, Nicolas? "I got up early this morning, and..." A little louder please, Nicolas. "...and it was still dark." No, from the start, please. "I got up early this morning, and it was still dark." Come on, kids. Please be silent. A little louder please, Nicolas. Let's try one last time, okay? "I got up early this morning, and it was still dark." Did anyone at the front row hear that? Don't forget your assignment. See you tomorrow. Okay, ready? Both of you? Three, two, one! Nico got it. Do you still want it now? Hey, easy. You do that in school too? Nicolas, how was your talk with the psychologist? You went, right? What did he say? Come on. "Mmm," "Yes," "No"... Laporte is a bitch. What's that got to do with it? A lot. - She's fat. - Let's be serious. Why are you two calling Miss Laporte a bitch? No reason. Keep it to yourself, okay. "I got up early this morning, and it was still dark." "I got up early this morning, and it was still..." I haven't told him you didn't go. Okay. Shall we do half each for French? I don't do homework for that bitch. Tomorrow morning then. Just tell her you forgot. She'll believe you. Come on, boys. You're going to be late. Here, take this. Put it away. The school psychologist called me. You can go today after the last class. You really have to go this time, okay? It's really important for you. Promise? Victor. "I get up at 9:00, I eat breakfast." Good, but no exceptions. Three pages in French on "Why I don't do my homework." Okay? Yes. Charlotte? "At eight o'clock I leave for school, I go by bus." Thank you, Charlotte. Nicolas? Nicolas, you haven't done it either? I forgot. Sorry? - I forgot. - Nicolas, I can't hear you. I forgot. This is impossible. We're wasting time here. We're going to make a deal here. Nicolas? If you can translate this sentence loud enough, you don't have to write the three pages, okay? That's not fair. There is nothing to be ashamed of. Go ahead. "There was mist at six o'clock in the..." You can do this. You just have to use your voice. Look at me. Are we going to try this again? Scream. Scream. Scream! Silence! You don't have to do it. It's your choice, okay? Silence! What did I say? Silence! Enough! Calm down. This is not acceptable. Nicolas. Come on. I ironed this shirt. Are you wearing it tonight? That's not mine. Where's yours then? I don't know, in the laundry? Turn that game off, and come down quickly, okay? - Happy birthday, Dad. - Thanks. - Hey, Hendrik. - Come on in. - How are you doing? - I'm all right. Vic, everyone is waiting for you. Here he is! My good friend. Nice shirt. You're looking really well, Victor. - He's grown, right? - Yes, he really has. Coke for the youngest one. How about us? I call that discrimination. - Did you say hi to everyone? - Yes. - A present. - And what do we say? Thank you, grandpa. It's a topsy-turvy world, isn't it, Victor? Grandpa's birthday and you get a present. He's being spoiled. Exciting. For your collection. Can you stop doing that on the plate? We still have to eat, play there. You have a new one for your collection now. You probably have loads of them, right? What's happening? Dad, this one's for you. Oh, no. Dad, that's water! Ros?! Victor once put orange juice in Nicolas' coke! Nico's face! That look. Right, Vic? Typical Victor. Good. Our weekend getaway. Shall we arrange that? Hey, Victor. Are you in the second grade now? You do Latin? - Uh, modern. - Oh, modern. Are you still going to school in the village next door? - No, in the athenaeum. - What are you saying? I go down the street, and take the bus. What are you saying? I'm sorry, I can't hear you. Iris, can you stop your loud laugh, I can't hear him. Or maybe Vic has to speak up. Come on, Hendrik. Don't. Vic was always... always good with language and stuff, right? You have to use your talents. Victor. You're not going to run away, are you? Let him be. Don't run away! Let him be. It Was Dark - Hi. - Hi. Well, you just have to tell yourself that it'll be fine... Hi. - You okay? - Yes. I totally screwed up! Yes! What's wrong? Good luck! Stop it! Can someone go and get a nurse? Are you okay? Hey. ChiaChia had three hits and four RBI's yesterday. I know. I was watching. Will you join our game today? I'm not sure. I have something to do at school. Xu Zhi-Hua said they're going to have a match with Class 3 on the field trip at Metropolitan Park tomorrow. The gloves! Don't get my gloves dirty all the time! Okay. You're making me late! Fine. Hurry up. Where's Metropolitan Park? Is it far? It's quite a distance. Will we get there by bike? We will if we keep going. KEEP GOING She's moving away. Why is she still taking that lesson? Why is your brother never on time? He's got stuff to do. Hey, it looks stupid when you wait for me there like that. It's no big deal. Well then don't wait for me there. Did you watch the game yesterday? My boy ChiaChia had three hits and four RBI's, but your Ginfeng had nothing. You're annoying! I didn't even bring anything up about ChiaChia. - Let me see. - No. - For a few seconds. - No! My brother's got ChiaChia's signed baseball. - Your brother lied. - It's true! - My brother got one. - He lied to you. I'll show you tomorrow. Let's see. Let's see. - You're scared. - No, I'm not! - I'm not either. - I'm not either. - I'll bring it tomorrow. - Liu Ru-Jia! You wanna play or not? No. Mom'll moan if we get home late. Why are you so late? What took you so long? I had stuff to do at school. Why are the gloves so dirty? Are they? Ru-Jia. Mom'll make you sushi for lunch tomorrow. Okay. Can I bring the signed ChiaChia ball to the field trip tomorrow? No. You'll lose it. I won't! No. Hey. Why have you left so much eggplant? Liu Ru-Shan! Ru-Jia. Fine. Fine. What are you doing? Go to sleep. Okay. After dismissal, go and wash your hands in the restroom. Understood! Okay. Group leaders, raise your hands. - Let me see. - No. - Please! - Liu Ru-Jia? Pay attention. If you get lost, look back everybody, there's a plaza. Wait there if you get lost, so I can see you. Stop playing... Liu Ju-Jia! It's him! Pass it. - Pass! - Pass! Give it to me! Pass! Give me that! Keep your hands off the ball! We'll still be in the championship in the second half of this season. Lamigo's pitch is too weak. We have many clean-up hitters. Our offense is unbeatable. ChiaChia is old. Still thirty percent of BA every year. But Lin Chih-Sheng got higher BA. Hey! I'm doing this all by myself! I'll help you out. Do you want my Ginfeng signed ball? Why? I'm moving. No one will chat baseball with me. When are you moving? My Dad said maybe sooner. Maybe tomorrow. Well... I'll leave first. Bye. Wu Pei-Lin... How about... I keep Ginfeng's... and you keep ChiaChia's? Yours? Yeah. We exchange. Cool. When will you leave? My Dad said 4:00 PM, so we meet at school at around 3:00 PM. Okay, at 3:00 PM. I'm leaving. Bye. - 3:00 PM! - Okay, 3:00 PM! Bye! What's wrong with you two? I'm full. I'm full too. Lu Riu-Jia. Hey! We could go find the ball tomorrow. But I have to send it out tomorrow. Who are you going to send it to? None of your business. She's moving. Let's go find it tomorrow early morning. Too far away. I thought you said we'll get there if we keep going? Remember where it is? I do! So who are you going to send it to? A classmate. Is she your girlfriend? No! So you've got a crush on her...? No. Then why do you want to give it to her? Get off! You're too heavy. Have we arrived yet? Not yet. What's wrong? The chain fell off. You don't know how to fix it? How come you don't know? I've fixed the chain... But as for this shifter... Well, I've done my best. We have a little problem here. Do you know how to fix it? Well my skills are also an issue. I have no idea. You should go to a professional bike store. Or this will come off again. So for all this, I'd say fifty dollars. Maybe thirty... Hey, look at this! Fifty is the best I can offer. Wait a second. Or forty? Did you pick up this ball at the park? It's my brother's. No. I got it at Tianmu Baseball Stadium five years ago. I waited in line for two hours. But ChiaChia only signed "Chia23" recently. He only signed Peng Chen Min, his real name, in the past. Uh, it was five months ago. You know, it's easy to mix up five months and five years. - It's my brother's! - You know how long that line was? That's my brother's! - All the Taiwanese... - It's still my brother's! It's my brother's! Fifty dollars. Yes or no? Or I'll pull it off. Come here! - Okay, fifty. - I'll pull it off. Fifty is fine. God I'm gonna be late. Who do you want to send it to? A classmate. We got the autograph together at Taichung Baseball Stadium. You weren't there. I was there! It was Chinatrust Brothers vs. EDA Rhinos. Not that one. You weren't there. - Liu Ru-Jia! - What? Let's go to the stadium! Why? It's the home of Chinatrust Brothers. Is there a match today? If not, then there could be a practice. Keep your eyes on the bike! Watch the bike! Hey! Anyone there? Peng Cheng-Min! Peng Cheng-Min! Peng Cheng-Min! Got it? - Show me. - Wait. - Let me take a look! - Let's go. - What's wrong with that? - Hurry we're going to be late. Okay. There! - Wu Pei Lin! - Wu Pei Lin! - Wu Pei Lin! - Wu Pei Lin! Wu Pei Lin! - Wu Pei Lin! - Wu Pei Lin! Hey! Wu Pei Lin! Wu Pei Lin! Hurry! - Hey! - Hey, Wu Pei Lin! I'm sorry. I'm sorry. That's okay. I thought you'd never come. What are you laughing at? My little brother lost the ball. What's in your hand? I signed it myself. Well that's stupid! Should I make one myself? So we could have each other's signed balls. This is so stupid. You serious? Sign it. For real? Okay, I'll sign it. Will she become your girlfriend? Not yet... Where's she going? Taipei. Is it far away? Could we reach there if we don't stop? It's too far. But if we keep going? KEEP GOING Bye. Tobias, you should be leaving now! One, two, three, four, five... Can you take that stinking bag outside? - Why do you always pick the fat one? - He's fun, so what? Fuck! The combo's aren't working. That's not what I did! Get him! This fucking game! Wanna break the record? Don't feel like it. One, two, three, four, five... six, seven, eight, nine... Wanna break the record? - And later? - Dude! ...seven, eight, nine, ten... Wanna play catch then? Throw it. Careful... Here. Retard! One, two, three, four... five, six, seven. Wanna break the record? One, two, three, four, five... six, seven, eight, nine, ten... ...996, 997, 998, 999, 1,000! Hi, Anders. It's Mads. Call me. I'm waiting for you. Come on. OUT OF THE BLUE Hey. I'm stepping on it. I'll be there in a few. You won't tell Dad, right? Okay... Mads, my man. Leave me alone. Stop it. - I had to take care of something. - I'm not going into that damn car! Something got in the way, but I've taken care of it. Let's go home. - I've been freezing here for two hours! - Perfect. I just installed heated seats. We just have to make a quick stop. You'll stay in the car. Why can't I come with you? It's cold out here. It won't take long. Do you want to put on some music? I meant the CDs. Put that thing out! I want to show you something. Check this out. It was supposed to be on my chest. From shoulder to shoulder. - Did it hurt? - No, it's a nice kind of pain. It's Anders. I'm on my way. Message me the address again. - You don't have to lock it. - You're not old enough! You have to wait in the car. - What's up? - Have you seen my brother? - Who is he? - Anders. Anders... Anders... Do you want to come in for a good laugh? - This stuff better be good. - It is. It's premium quality. - Are you some kind of wimp? - No, I think it's working now. About time. This is good stuff. Gas, man! Don't you wanna try? - What about the money? - Relax, dude. - Come on, try it. - No thanks. Dude, that's hilarious. You must be tired. Why don't you do something? What do you mean? - They're a bunch of idiots. - They're not idiots. - Yeah, and so are you. - Who do you think you are? - I'm your brother, actually. - You're just a little boy. Take a look in the mirror. You ugly kid! Shut up and mind your own business. I won't put up with this. Mads, what are you doing? - What are you doing? - I'm calling Dad. - Don't you dare! - I'll call him. Don't fucking call Dad when I'm asking you not to! What the fuck are you doing? - I'm calling Dad. - The fuck you won't. Are you okay? Only the left headlight broke. Look. We can't leave it here. A fucking deer. Do you think it's dead? Yes. Let's take it with us. Is it bad? Yeah, it's pretty bad. Shit. Get it in. I can't drive. You'll drive us home. I can't. Fine! Then we'll stay here. You, me and the animal. - What now? - Find the clutch. Press it. Hold the clutch. Do it slowly. - It's like it's stuck. - Relax. - Yeah, but... - Take it easy. I stole this from those idiots. I saw it in a movie. Here. You won't tell Dad, right? This is our secret. Okay. CHAOS IS A LADDER Hey, Ana?s Badger-Stinker. Are you avoiding me or what? No point covering up with big jeans... I know the fat bulges out from all sides. It's not much of a turn-on, you know. Nobody'll want to shag you. Try harder! Come on, Ana?s. The bell's about to go. Could you not see we were talking? Talking? About what? Going to Mars? Leave it! Come on. It doesn't matter. If you keep that up, I'm telling you it won't end well. Let's sort this out now. Come on! Do you have proof to back up your accusation? Proof? This morning, he took a swipe at me in front of fifty people! I had twenty euro when I got into class. Ask him to empty his pockets! He's a thief! - You're dead. I swear, you're dead! - Logan! That's enough! Sure, Logan. You're so tough, just like your dad... Okay, Jules, you can go now. Thanks. So, Logan, how are things at home at the moment? And you, are you okay? Still single? I like older women. I'm all yours. Okay, I'm making you go to a disciplinary hearing. Happy now? I don't care. - It's your birthday tomorrow. - Are you going to surprise me? You turn sixteen. - And? - School isn't compulsory at sixteen... Logan! Jules! That's for talking shit about my father. You've lost it! You're crazy! And that goes for everyone! Out of my way! Did you not ask to stop working nights? I'll be back at 10:00, alright? - So, you won't be here for dinner...? - Is that a problem? If you're not happy, why don't you do my job, Logan? "Mars Colony aims to establish the first human colony on Mars in 2026, when the infrastructure is in place. The infrastructure will be improved gradually, as astronauts live and work on Mars. The population should reach 1,500 people by 2060. This will be the next giant leap for mankind." Can you imagine! They're going to build a new civilisation! It's exactly like in your books, except it's not sci-fi anymore. A colony on Mars. If this had existed in your day, I'm sure you would have been part of it. Loggy, I need to pee. You've just been! Go back to bed, I'll come. The combustion generator revealed no trace of carbon dioxide in the crack that they made in the polar cap... Their days on Mars were numbered. Suddenly, GlopGlop began to communicate with Tiago through his green antennae. "You need to go there! Ice has blocked the outlet for the dioxide! It may all blow up! You have to go! You need to crack it open to release the dioxide!" What do you have to do to apply to Mars Colony? You were about to save the world! Do you have to pay? No. Just make a video and say why you want to go. - Why don't you apply? - Because you have to be eighteen. And you have to be superhuman. You've no idea. - So, you have the time to become one. - Become what? Superhuman! Right, so do I continue or not? Hello, my name is Logan Tournier and I would like to participate in the Mars Colony mission. Tomorrow is my birthday. I'll be sixteen, but I thought it might still be okay to apply. I repeated two years in school because I had problems, but I'm very good at science. I live in Brignais... and I'm in middle school. Tell them you love to laze about. You'll see they might even take you on. They always need someone to fuck everything up. Keep quiet! Don't touch me or I'll kill you! I know you're a tough guy, Logan. That's why I need you. Who are you? I'm CT-LT030426A. That's my registered ID. It stands for Citizen Logan Tournier born on the 26th of April 2003. And the "A" is in case there are more than one. But I've never met another. My name is Logan Tournier too. I mean, I've never met any others apart from myself. Logan... I'm you. Thirty-nine years older. I've come from the future, and I have a mission for you. That's why I'm here. A mission that may save mankind. Dad! Dad! He was just there! He said he was me. I shoved him away and ran out to get you. He said he was from the future. I swear, Dad! From the future? Yeah, right... Five minutes ago, there was a guy here from the future? Is that what you're telling me? Are you fucking kidding me? IF DAD HIT YOU, COME MEET ME OUTSIDE. I knew you'd come out. You can't stand this awful existence. - Do you have any marks? - What do you mean? You know, identifying marks... I have a birthmark here, for example... I don't think you do, because I don't have one. Look... Okay, I don't either. Stop that right now. - You see, there's no point in lying. - Come on. No need to look disgusted. My dick is your dick. I used to like this car. It's a piece of shit. A piece of shit that we like. We had good times in this car. Let's assume I believe you. What do you want? Okay. I need you. We're on a mission. So hold on tight, because this'll turn your life upside down. In two years' time, the greatest dictator of all time will be born. And when he's just thirty-five, he will cause an unparalleled genocide in Africa. Genocide in Africa...? That's a bit random. Climate change will lead to huge waves of immigrants descending on Europe, resulting in the return of extreme nationalism and xenophobia. Sounds like you've learned this off by heart. Of course I've learned it off by heart. Anyway... The tension between the United States, the European Confederation and the Ural-Asian Alliance will lead to the remilitarisation of those countries, all focused on Mars, the new climatic El Dorado. - Mars? - Mars. Have you been there? Yeah. I was one of the first settlers. Did you go with Mars Colony? You need to be eighteen. Yeah. So, I waited until I was eighteen. - And you were accepted? - Well, yeah. I really wanted it. I worked hard. So, what's the atmosphere like? Did you melt the polar ice cap? - And produce greenhouse gases? - Yeah. And activate the hydrosphere of the planet? Yes, but now is not the time to talk about it. Anyway, you're going to take care of it. I've been sent back here to prevent a dictator from being born. It's a bit like killing Adolf Hitler before he could cause havoc. Do you understand? Why don't you go and kill Hitler then? Damn, you're annoying! You can only time travel within your own lifetime. I can't travel back any further than my birth date... The 26th of April 2003. So, why did they choose you then? That's a good question. I went to school with Ana?s, Leo Barger-Tinger's mother. I have a special connection with her because of you. Ana?s Badger-Stinker? And what's all this got to do with me? You have to sleep with her. What? With Ana?s? How is that relevant? It's not relevant. But if she sleeps with a boy now, it'll change her life. And then, Leo Barger-Tinger will never be born. But why me? She won't do it, she hates me! Why don't you do it? Quick! Get out of here! I couldn't sleep. Do you know what your brother told me? He said he'll be happy for you if you get to go to Mars, but that he'll miss you. Are you an idiot or what? You stink of alcohol. Right! To bed, now! That's enough. Come here now! Now, Logan! Come on! What are you playing at? You have five minutes to get to bed, alright? If I get hit again, I'm turning you in. You're turning me in? Me? If I'm doing this shit, it's for you! My mission is your mission, okay? Oh, fuck off! Logan, you have huge potential and you don't even realise it. Have a serious think about life. You want to change things? Change things? Do you want to change things? You came to tell end-of-the-world stories, you could have come four years ago and saved Mum! That's... This is our mission. I'm sorry. Okay, listen! If you change your mind, call me. But make it tomorrow. Because this weekend, Ana?s will meet the moron who will be L?o's father. For our mission to succeed, get to school late tomorrow... - ...and sit beside her in history class. - What's that got to do with it? If I'm late, I won't be allowed into class. Listen! Trust me! You arrive late and you sit beside her. Oh, yes! This is important... You need to borrow a pen from her. Hey, Logan, it's five past midnight. Happy birthday! Here! Twenty euro for your picnic lunch. You can buy a sandwich. Did Dad give you the money? None of your business. And bring back the change. ...freedom of expression, including freedom of the press and freedom of association. Yes, come in. Come in! No, you're late. Go to the office. But Sir, I was with the principal. What connection can you make between the German economic crisis and the Nazi party in the 1920s and 1930s? Hi. - Hi. - At the beginning of the 1930s... ...Germany is affected by the Great Depression, okay? The Nazis come to power during an economic crisis. Can I borrow a pen, please? Adolf Hitler is appointed Chancellor in 1933. He is supported by a large portion of the population. And after a fire at the parliament building, the Reichstag, he imposes a dictatorship. Exercise fifty-five, page eighty-five. Tiago! Come back here! Tiago! Hurry up. Hurry up! - Did you turn up late this morning? - Yes. I sat beside Ana?s and I asked to borrow a pen. Great. And did she tell you the number of the exercise? - Yes. - Perfect. If I do what you say, will you take me with you to Mars? And Tiago too? - Are her parents not home? - No, they're at a funeral. Ana?s's grandmother. She's going this weekend. That's where she'll meet the father of L?o. Anyway, it doesn't matter. Repeat your phrase. The phrase is stupid. I don't understand... I don't care if you understand or not! "The world..." "The world is not as you imagine. And we all have the power to change it." Because? "Because daisies are white and my love is gentle." That doesn't make any sense. I didn't choose the phrase, but it's part of the mission. It will have a sort of power over her. That's all you need to know. - She'll never want to. - Yes, she will. It's planned. But don't add anything, because I don't know what effect it might have. And after that, what do I do? Do I kiss her? No, definitely not! She'll offer you an apple juice. Tell her that you're allergic. It gives you pimples. That'll make her smile and she'll take you into her bedroom. She'll say "wait a minute" and go into the bathroom. While she's in the bathroom, you take your clothes off! What do you mean? What do you mean, "What do you mean?"? You get naked. You won't do it dressed, will you? Who would have been my first? Your first? Oh, I don't know. It's a long time ago. I don't remember. Some girl from summer camp. I wasn't very picky. You don't even remember her first name? Are you suddenly a romantic? No, I don't remember her first name. I remember she had a broken tooth, that's all. At camp... I've never been to summer camp. You haven't been to camp and you haven't slept with a girl either. There are plenty of things you still have to do, Logan. Oh, shit! I nearly forgot... You don't want to get her pregnant. Here! Here she is. Are you ready? I can't. I'm scared. Come on, be brave! You're going to change your life. Are we here to save mankind, or what? Go on. Where will I meet you afterwards? - I'll wait for you here. - But how do we travel back? I'll wait for you here. The time portal is at the back of the van. - So, we leave straight afterwards? - When the mission is complete. I'll have to get my brother, and say goodbye to my granddad. And maybe we can save Mum... Maybe. Logan? What are you doing here? Hi, Ana?s. I wanted to say something to you. The world is not as you imagine, and we all have the power to change it. I don't get it, Logan. I'm closing the door, okay? Wait! The world is not as you imagine, and we all have the power to change it. Because daisies are white and my love is gentle. Do you want to come in? Do you want an apple juice? No, thanks. I'm allergic. It gives me pimples. This way. I'll be back in a minute. Ana?s... I'm sorry about your grandmother. If my granddad died, even if he's not completely with it, it would be strange if he wasn't here. Okay. And just one more thing... I'm sorry I act like a moron at school. Wait for me here. Hey! The idiot is putting down the blinds! I want to stop the whole thing. - It's not right. - It's not right? This is "not right," okay? Is it right to throw Hugo in a bin? And everything else he does. Fuck it! He hassles you every day! Go on, hurry, or we won't get to see anything! I'll be there in a minute, Logan, okay? Jules You're dead Leaving already? Good prank! Well, Logan. We heard you want to go to Mars. Anything to say to your audience? That's it. Run! Film his ass! Film his ass! - Arsehole! - Look how lost he looks, the poor guy. What are you doing? Come back! Stop! Bastard! You screwed me over! Get out! Stop! Get out! No! Logan? Are you okay? What's happening? What's happening, my friend? Breathe slowly. Wait. Put this on. Are you okay? Look at me. Breathe with me. Breathe with me. Are you okay? Come on, my friend. It's over. - What's over? - Everything. No, it's not over. I'll take you home, okay? No, stay here with me, please... I'm sorry, my friend. - Stay with me... - I'm sorry. Forgive me... I don't understand... They go up there, and then... What? - They stay there? - Yes. That means that they go to Mars knowing they're going to die there? Yes. Herv?? Herv?. So? You work in a supermarket, is that right? Yes, but I'm really an actor... Fuck. I've been screwed over by a failed actor. How much did they pay you? I didn't take their money in the end. A time portal in the back of the van. We don't even look alike. Logan... If it's your dream, you should go for it. Take his clothes! Take his clothes! Go on, run! Run! Look how lost he looks, the poor guy. Sorry Ana?s Hello. My name is Logan Tournier and I would like to participate in the Mars Colony mission. Sometimes, I get up in the morning... and I do things... and I don't even know why. It's as if I'm not really alive. As if my fate is already decided... Everyone is expected to just act it out without asking any questions. The worst thing is I hate it. I feel like I can do anything I want, but I'm standing in my own way. Like I won't allow myself... All I want is to go and colonise Mars. Maybe I'm not superhuman, but I'm good at taking blows and it'll be hard there. Today I found out what suffering is. I know I can take the blows. The more people hurt me, the less I'm affected. And I know you need people like me... People who have nothing to lose. For my ninth birthday, my mother gave me a telescope and it has allowed me to travel. It helped me progress. It even put my mind at ease. But it's no longer enough. I need to see further. People think it's strange to want to go to Mars and maybe never return. To me, what's strange is to want to stay here, to accept everything and do nothing. I feel like everything is dying here. Dying for the sake of dying. We may as well serve a purpose.
