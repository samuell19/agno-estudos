(Desert) -Hi. -Hey. I knew this would happen. Koreans would be talking about money among themselves, and then get scammed for it. This is such an embarrassment. Why are they doing it here? I see. It's not like their life will change. So, you're finally getting married. Good for you! Congratulations! -Thank you. -You were so worried about it before. Tell me if you need anything. -Sure. -I will help with anything I can. Thank you. All I have are my videos, so I'm not sure if I can be of much help either. Hey.

"And they filled them up to the brim." Who wants to read the next one? Anyone? Chorong? "And he said to them," "Now draw some out and take it to the master of the feast." So, they took it and brought it to the master of the feast. Yes, that's right. Good job. Who wants to read the English version? Sure, go ahead and read it. Jesus said to them fill the pot. The water pots with water, and they filled them up to the brim. See you next week. -See you next week. Good bye. -Bye. Bye! -Hello. -Hello. -Have you been well? -Yes. -Well, I have a bit of a request from you. -What request? -I'll be getting married on the 21st. -I see. -Congratulations. -Thank you. -The thing is, will you be my witness? -On the 21st? -Be your witness on the 21st? -Yes. You're not holding any wedding ceremony? Yes, no ceremony, just... -I see. We're just going to register our marriage, but I need a witness... That's why. -Will you be able to... -Sure. It's a happy occasion. -Thank you. -So, I just need to come on the 21st? -I'll make sure to contact you before. -Congratulations. -Thank you. -Good bye, and don't forget to contact me. -Sure, I'll make sure to do that. Bye. -Sure, sure. -Yes, good bye. -Bye. So I'll see you there at one? Sure. -See you. -Bye. -Hello. -Hello. I guess your future husband is not here yet? Yes, not yet. I guess he's a bit late. Please wait inside. -Sure. -All right. Do you confirm that you are Keum Wookang? Yes. Do you confirm that you are Seojun Won? Yes. So, the law requires that each of you declare... ...in my presence and in the presence of these two witnesses, that you do not know of any impediments to this marriage. That you can take each other to be your legal wife and husband. So can you repeat after me? I solemnly declare. "I solemnly declare." That I do not know of any impediment to... It's across the hallway. -Thank you. -Thank you. Congratulations. Jenny and James. Jenny and James? Jenny and James? Okay, I think it's good. Jenny. Have you finished the work we talked about last time? Jenny? I'm asking if you've finished filming the work from last time. No, not yet. What's wrong with you? You're acting weird today. Why are you so out of it today? Gosh, the economy is bad as well these days. They're bad. What do we do with this? Just look at this. I need to go out now and someone will look for me later. -Just say that you don't know. Okay? -Sure. Hello, Tina Enterprises, how can I help? Hi, can I please talk to James? -James in IT? -James, yeah. Sorry, James resigned a few weeks ago. Pardon? James is no longer with us. Can I put you through to someone else? Can you hold the line please? Miss Reporter. Hey. Excuse me? Excuse me. Hey! -Hello. -Oh, hello. This is where I'm from. Where's your boss? He's not here at the moment. Where did he went to? To smoke? No, he didn't. He was here, but he left. Did he do it again? This bastard. He ended it. What the heck?! Did he not tell you where he went? No, he didn't say anything. Did he left any money? -Money? -Yes. In a white envelope or something. Check for me, please. No, he didn't. Gosh, this is driving me nuts. Is this a pyramid scheme? You need to pay to put up your ads. What do you think you're doing right now? ?? Do you want to eat some kimbab ? It's not the time for kimbab. Forget it. Well... Do you have ramyeon too? Oh my, who are you? Can I help you? I'm looking for Meegan. Do you have an appointment with her? No. Okay. Would you like me to check to see if she's available? Yes, please. No, sorry, she's not available. Meegan. Meegan. You got a real nerve showing your face around here. Why? Why is that? You know, I didn't actually know that James did that to you. I'm sorry about that. We're all pretty pissed off around here. He borrowed money from a lot of us. He actually told us that it was for you and the baby. So I just assumed that you knew. We would love to know where he is. If I hear anything, I'll give you a call. I should probably go. Hello, teacher. -Hello. -Let's have some talk. Sure. How have you been these days? Just... yeah... You look a bit weak. It's nothing big. It's a bit difficult to say this to you. As you know, there are bad rumors going around about you even among the kids. It's reached even to the other believers. I know it's not your intention but the rumors are bad. I know that you're working hard in teaching the kids, and I'm also thankful that you're working hard as a volunteer. ?? We also have a few people who joined us for volunteer works. So, I was wondering what do you think of taking a break from teaching? It's hard for me to talk to you about it. It's hard for you as well. All the people who knows you are praying that things would work well for you too. We are hoping that things will settle well for you. So, I hope you won't be upset. I just hope you can spend some personal time at home. Okay. Thank you. -By the way, I came here a lot with a man. -Yes. Have you seen him here recently? I'm not so sure. They all look to me. I see. Have you been here before? Okay, you'll have to fill out this form. (Unplanned Pregnancy) (Unplanned Pregnancy.) (Request an abortion.) (What choices do you have?) The number you are trying to reach is not permitted to receive calls. Do you remember? We... ...have decided... ...to name the baby in both English and Korean. So, we thought about it. If it's a girl, her name would be Mary or Mari. And if it's a boy, we'd name him Eugene or Yoojin. What do you think? Why aren't you saying anything? Why aren't you saying anything? Don't you have any opinion? What are you doing? Take them. What's that? It's good for babies. Here it is. How did you know? Why didn't you tell me anything. You're upsetting me. It's a topic among the ladies. Let's have dinner party on Friday. Excuse me. Where is your boss? He's not here. By the way, can we look for people with ads too? Of course. Why? You want to put up an ad for it? There are two types for it. A colored one with pictures. A big picture. That's $300. Then, black and white with pictures. That's $150. There's a lot of it looking for scammers and missing person. The results were good. Can we find New Zealand people as well? They're humans too, of course we can. Nothing stopping us from finding them. But instead... Well... Do you have any good clues... ...that will help in the search? Do you have something like that? Computer? I have a computer. Computer. It's a great house. -Is this it? -Yes. Turn it on. It won't go beyond this. Why so? There's password. Why are you looking at others' stuff? So what? Are you pregnant? It's not your business. Is the father the one you're searching for? Why? Did he ran away? You shouldn't say things so easily like that. Don't just speak carelessly about it. You don't even know anything. I mean... That's how it seems. It's not like I did anything... What is it that I don't know? Tell me. Aren't you being too rude right now? No, but... -I'll look for him then. Let me do it. -Forget it! Girls are bad at these things. So, let me... -Let me go at it. -I said forget it! What's wrong with you? Move! I'm trying to look for him. What a bother. Hold on. But why are you getting so mad at me for? What did I ever do wrong to you? Is it my fault your boyfriend ran away? Do you think I'm doing this because I have so much free time? I have so many places I need to go. You should be thankful that I'm trying to help. So absurd. What is this now? What do you expect me to do when there's password? Are you angry? Why would you be angry over something like that? It's over here. Long time no see. What is it now? I'm not here about money, so don't worry. -Do me a favor. -What is it? I'm looking for someone and this is his computer. It has password, so I can't do anything with it. Can you check for any clue inside? What do you expect me to do? Don't you know it's illegal? But you've done it before. I don't know anything. If you find any clues about him, please let me know. But who's that woman you came here with? -Someone I'm working with. -Your girlfriend? No, she's not. Just help me settle this quickly. Give a discount on our ads, then I'll do it. -The ads fee. -Fine, I'll try talking to my boss. I'll be nice to you, so please hurry and settle this for me. Is she really not your girlfriend? I told you, she's not! Then, introduce her to me. We'll see. Okay. Then, I take that you've reduced the ads fee. Just leave it there. -Call me. -Don't forget to introduce her to me. Sure, sure. I need to stop by somewhere. I'll stop by there, then I'll drop you off. Did you see it appeared on our newspaper this time? Han Yuri? She's really something. -Where do you exchange currency? -Just at the bank. That was unexpected. It's hard to change from the bank these days. Do you do it a lot? No, not really. Then, don't go to bank next time. Someone I know does money exchange. He's an acquittance of mine, so he/she could help. He/she is really good. So... I'll introduce you two to each other. Just contact me. Please wait a minute. Hello, ma'am. I'm from Korea Herald. It's collecting money day today. Why did you came here so fast? What? But today is really the collecting money day. -It's not like you're not used to it. -So boring. -I don't have it. -Really? My business has been bad lately. You can't do this to me, ma'am. It's been a few years, why are you cold to me so suddenly? -The business has been slow. -I see. Hello. -Oh my! How have you been? -Fine. It's been a while. -How have you been? -Good. Are the two of you...? Why are you here with Joon? For no reason. -But... -Do you know her? Of course I do. She's my customer. Your customer? I see. You've gotten a lot prettier. I guess you know her? Just back then... Getting money from her was always hard. Thanks to you, I got the money. You're quite useful. I should bring you with me every day. We're here. Bye. Next Friday, our boss is going to have a dinner party. Okay, bye. Hello. Yes sir, how are you? Yes, sir. The money? I'll give it, of course. Did I ever say I won't give it? Oh, dear, the drink I'm waiting for is finally here. Why do I feel so good whenever I look at it? How can one live without alcohol? It's alcohol. Who should I give it too first? Should I pour it for you first, Jiwoo? -Sure. -Okay, drink. I know it's been tough lately. Even though there's not much customer you're free at night. Okay. Let me pour for you. -You're doing good at school, right? -Yes. You worked so hard to work and study. -Jenny, drink a glass too. -I'll pass. Just take it. -No, it's okay. -Just take it. My hands are getting tired. Just drink it. What are you doing? This is the first shot, so you should accept it. -You know why. -God damn it. There's something call drinking etiquette. Hurry. Hurry up. Good job. I'll just give a tiny bit. Next for Yigeum. -Pick up your glass now. -That's right! I just can't live without you. Let's go all the way today. -All right. -Okay. Before we toast, I want to say something. Can I say it? It's not fun, but just listen anyway. The real reason I gathered all of you here is... We're too focused on being a competition. Nowhere is doing fine now. The Koreans in New Zealand are having a hard time too. Everyone's business is going under. No one says good thing anymore. How can we survive that way? But just trust me. What kind of person am I? I am ambitious. I will make sure to buy all the video shop in New Zealand. If you treat me good and if you do your job well...??? If you guys want it, I can even provide a permanent resident card for you. Let's do well. So, hold on a bit even though you're going through a hard time. This dinner is held to give more energy to everyone, so put your glasses up. Let's forget everything and have fun. And then work hard the next day. Let's have fun today. Okay? -Okay. -Okay. Okay, cheers! Cheers. Jenny, hold it up. That's right. This brat. You need to hold it with both hands. That's right. Okay, one more time. Okay, cheers. That's right. Soju is the best booze. -Right? -Yeah. The snack are here. Go ahead and eat. -Drink as much as you want. -Okay. Should we heighten up the atmosphere? Who wants to sing first? Should we heighten up the atmosphere with a song? I'm going to eat. You're going to eat? -I'm hungry. -Sure. Then, Geum, go ahead and sing. Sir, you go first. -This brat. -You're better at this. Go ahead and sing number 38. Press the number in and I'll sing it to heighten up the atmosphere. -What are you looking for? -Okay, okay. It's not like you haven't been here before. Yes, that's right. There it is! There it is. Let's do this! Take it! Take it! Oh, I'm sorry. Yes. Please hold on a minute. Excuse me, can we go to the washroom? Let's go. Did you drink yet? Here. No, thank you. Just take it. -No, thank you. -It's all right. I told you, it's okay. Should we sing a song together? Let's do it. You're leaving already? Hello. Can I look at the CCTV? Hello? Hi, it's Meegan. I know where James is. Hold on. It's the City Palace Apartment, 120, 10th street. 120. It's apartment 3F. That's all I know. Good luck. Are you lost? Where's your mommy? Are you lost? Where's your mommy? Good day. Is James here? James? James. No, no. No, he was here ages ago. But he moved out. -Do you want to come in? -No. You went back safely yesterday, right? Am I dying or what? I black out every time I drink now. Gosh, the worse. I'm going to get hangover soup with Mr. Kim, I'll come back later. Okay. Don't forget it and look after the shop. Sleeping again? Hey. -This is... -Not that one. -The front. -What? Where? Front? No, not there. Over here. It came out well, right? You can't miss it. Where did you get the picture from? How is that important? What matter is that it's out. It's $150 but I worked so hard to get it only $100. But can we find him with just this one thing? Korean read it, do you think foreigners would read this paper? If it's not Herald Korea, do you think it would work with a picture as an ad like this? You're upsetting me. I worked so hard for it. Tell me if someone contact you. Where are you going? It's lunch time, so I'm going out. Good then, you should at least treat me to lunch. I worked so hard on it. Aren't you supposed to treat me lunch? Because it's before lunch hour, I need to collect some money. I need to stop by those places. Go ahead. Who knows, it could be like last time. Like bringing you with me could give a good outcome of getting my commission. That would be so great. If I get to collect money, I'll treat you. But I might not be able to collect any. In that case, it's your treat. Hello? Anyone here? Yes. -You come here. -Hey. You sure are something! -What the heck? Is she with you? -No, she's not. -Come here! Come here! -She's not related to me. What do you mean not related? You stay here. Aren't you the same side? -No, we're not. -Stay here. -Come here! -Let's talk outside. Fine. What is it? What are you doing? What misunderstanding? What are you going to do with my money? -It's an investment. -Investment my foot! Is investment not receiving any revenue? -I need to have money to give it to you. -Why won't you gain money? You need to wait. Why aren't I making money? -Calm down. It's all a misunderstanding. -Give me back my money! Give me back my money! How many times do I need tell you? Give me back my money, you brat! Let's go. -What happened? -It's nothing, let's go. That bastard is so funny. We're both investors. I did give him some information but... Why is he making me into a scammer? You don't seem like one. I'm really not. It's a misunderstanding. When people make an investment, they can gain money... and they might not get it too. I didn't get it either. It's not like I'm the only one making money. Fine, I lost. I lost. Did I take all the profit? Did I take his money away? I'm a victim too! What a mean bastard! These dirty little bugs. I won't ever find them again! Ever. I'm really leaving this country. I'm going to ??? because I don't want to see bastards like him anymore. Those rat! Why is the stain not removed? Forget it. I... You remember my friend from the other day? The one good at computer? I got a call from him. He said he found something inside it. Let's head there. Okay? The stain is not removing. What the heck? Where's everyone? What happened? They didn't inform me about anything. Oh no, my computer. Oh, no. Excuse me, what happened here? The cops busted that place up. They really didn't inform me about anything. Darn it! What do I do now? Damn it, this brat! He should have called me! What the heck is this? Let's go eat instead. Let's think about it while eating. I'm hungry. This is really driving me crazy. What a day! What are you planning to do by finding him? Just forget it. I want to see how well he's living. It's probably about the same anyway. Why would you look for him? Just stop. Then, why are you working so hard to look for money? A man need to have money. Honestly, do you want to be with a man who don't have hose, car or money? Anyway, a man need money. I need to have a lot of money for others to fall for me. Don't you think so? Those who have nothing are practically scammers. I can't understand why they're like that. This place is good. What's so good about it? Why? There's ginseng, arrowroot and mushroom in it. Did you get this personally made? My boss gave it to me. This thing... Don't eat this. It's not good for pregnant woman. Maybe it's okay after giving birth. Why would you even eat something you don't know? I'm going to the washroom. Should we go somewhere to cheer ourselves up? Let's go on a walk. The sea is the best at night. What the heck? You can't see anything and it's just cold. What do you mean by only being cold? You can see everything. There's the moon, and the stars. There's the sea, what else do you need? It's just nice. I'm going to quit my job. Why? People need to be comfortable at work, but I don't like it and the owner is an oldie. I don't like some people too. I need to make money. I plan on moving to other country. To where? I haven't decided yet. China? Or Africa? I'm going to make it big there and when I come back, I'll treat you to a big meal. It must be nice. You even have such dream. What's so great about it? What are you going to do? You have a kid. Are you going to keep on staying here? What about the visa? Do you have any plan? Well... I'll just stay here, of course. Going to other places won't change anything. You make it sound so depressing. We came here to cheer ourselves up but the atmosphere is so dark. Do you know why I want to see the sea at night? I don't know. Ta-da! What's that? Can't you tell? it's obviously fireworks. Where did you get it from? I got it from a kid at the restaurant. Why does it matter? Why would you play fireworks when it's so cold. We're not kids. Who cares about age when it comes to fireworks? We just play with it. I know you'll like it once it's lit. It's pretty, right? It's very pretty. It's so pretty. Run from over there. Can you hold this for me? What are you doing? Hurry and come here. Look at this. Jenny! We're here. Get out. Are you okay? You're all wet. Hold on. Come out, stand up. Hello. This is Downtown Food Court. I'm calling you because of the picture in the newspaper. The customer is here now. I think you can meet him if you come here now. -Hello. -Hello. I received a call from you just now. Really? But what to do? He just left. How did you find me? I mean, how did you know? Are you alright? Let me take your order. Yes, please give us one bibimbap and one cold noodles. All right. Did you tell him about the mushrooms? Excuse me. -Excuse me? -Hold on. I shouldn't have give the money back. Jenny, do you remember that guy? The guy who always came here to collect money? He took all of the money he collected, and ran away at night. Mr. Kim and Mr. Jung are in an uproar about catching him. Did he acted weird when he came here last time? Some say they went to Africa. There are those who said they went to Australia and Korea too. What is going on here? Why do such things to their own people? He looks like a weasel. Who knew such thing would happen? You can never know what a person is really thinking. That brat left after causing a big problem. I can't believe this. How can we trust people when doing business now? What's wrong? Where are you going? I'm quitting. Hey, what's wrong with you? How can you just leave like that? What's wrong with you? Is it because of the visa? Jenny. -I'm sorry. -It's okay. Hey! Hey, do you know how many times has it been? I told you last time to give my money back. How many times do I need to repeat myself? How many times do I need to repeat myself? You brat! Hey, give it back! Now! What do you think you're doing?! This brat! You jerk! -Hello? -Yeah, it's me. What? It's me! Well, the thing is... I'm going abroad soon. Well, before I go, Have you settled your visa issue. I can help settle it for you. I'll marry you. Well, do you want to marry me? We don't need any ceremony. Just the two of us. I'm fine now. You reject me so fast. I'm being serious though. Then... Do you have a plan on how you're going to live or what? Just make sure to treat me when you come back. Of course, I should. I told you I'm going to be successful. Have a safe trip. Oh... Okay... Sure... By the way, I...
