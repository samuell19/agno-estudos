Any reference to living persons is purely coincidental Blue sends his apologies, Pops. There was a mix-up. Masha, wrong time to sing. Fine, we're good. Smokey will polish it off. Stop stuffing your face! Stop it! You'll get the shits. Dummy. You'll be shitting green for a month... Masha, you think this is a toy? You won't be let in the car. Only in the trunk. Come on! Whoop! Drop the gun. Move it. Now you're silent. Sing! It's in English, you won't get it anyway. Ugh, smart pants. Come on, sing loudly, like you're on stage. MASHA He's a hunk! Pass me some! Stop chopping. Let me pass this. Just like our Sanya! Did you leave them in the field? Why, they'll make a good fertilizer. Does Pops know that we got their truck? Yeah, it's right there. Did you drag Masha into this? Lost your screws boxing? No brains... - Nadya, would you just... I've got brains? He does. Pops is the trainer, he is the brains. - You see, I think! Mom! - Yes? Gazpacho is getting cold. They know how to eat, leave 'em be. Make sure you eat bread, Masha. Or you'll end up a skeleton. Want bread? Nah, I don't eat it. Just like me? Masha! Masha, are you ready? It's time to sail. Who's our lunch captain? We need our vitamins, the captain should eat well. Fill up your tank. First of all, I don't eat bread. And this is too much. Masha! All right, I'll take some off, but you need to eat this. Cho-choo, we're all set to sail! And there's not enough of this. By the way, I don't eat this soup. Masha! Whores. Come on... Pour! I'm coming, Masha! Masha, sit still. My, my, my. Can't get it in? Nah. Just wait, I'll pocket this one. No sweat. I'm waiting. Not my day, Pops. Enough of this. Let's hit the sauna! Nah, let's finish it first. What do you want? I've been braided. Look who's here! - Masha, go away. - Hold on. Hey kid! Say hello. Go away! - I'm not a kid, I'm Masha. - Masha-Masha, mighty gnasher. You've gotten big, haven't you? I'm not big, I'm elegant. Look at those braids! - Masha, I didn't call you. Scat. Why? Let her stay. - She'll grow to be better than us, freer. - Let me go. - Come on, let's play. - Let me go! Go already. Come on, Masha, let's play! I need to pee. Stay, let's play! She needs to pee. Masha! Aren't you afraid to walk around alone? With all those boys out there. And she's already ready, isn't she? You didn't get that smart about the oil mill, did you? Pops, no... Not with the families here. It's against the Code. Come on, son! Are we gonna sing or what? Somebody, pinch those lovebirds. How are you? I'm good. - Hello! - Hi! Good evening! Please welcome Tanya. Masha, Masha! Enough of that! Put that away. You like it? Masha! Speak up, speak up! Yeah! I said yes! What did you want? M? An autograph. Come on. Valera told me you're a good singer. Valera, your girl sings like Merlin Monroe, for real! For Valera! For Pops' son! For Tanya! Have you heard Tanya singing? To Valera! Thrice, look! Masha! I have to go. Bye! Hi! Why are you sneaking around? Don't want them to see me. You and your posh school. Me and my mug. Don't wanna cramp your style. Nothing wrong with your mug. Think so? Nice. Very nice. You like it? Nice, real nice. Like it? Take 'em. Come on. No, no, no, please. It's my gift. Well, it's my gift, so... Take this. As God is my witness, they're not going to lick me. I'm going to live through this and when it's all over, I'll never be hungry again. If I have to lie, steal, cheat or kill. What's wrong? As God is my witness, I'll never be hungry again! Never! Masha, I am Scarlett-O'Hara, for reals. Masha... You are, erm... Like, bleeding. Womanly. What now? Go to the drugstore. They won't sell it to me. I'm not 18 yet. You mean you only get this stuff when you turn 18? You mean I should go? Picture that: a man walks in and asks... What do I tell 'em? I feel sick. Stay here. Len! Psss! Psss yourself. There's, erm... Show her. An emergency. It's not an emergency. It's an honor. Come. - Are you Masha? - Yeah. Come with me. I was told to walk you out. Come on! Careful - stairs. Hello! Masha, what happened? Baby, what's wrong, what is it? What happened? What's wrong, baby? Did someone hurt you? Who? That guy. Denim jacket. Him? Stay here. Back off! Get off him! Got that, scum? Fucker! Piece of shit! Don't touch him! Mess with her... Get off him! Don't touch him! ...and I'll fucking kill you, you hear me? They just thought you were someone else. Masha, thank you for stepping in. Who are those guys anyway? That's Thrice, my best friend. He is always like that, has my back. He's just a bit dumb. I'm sorry he got confused. I've told him off already. Some friends you have... Don't eat. Wait for me! All right, throw it. Keep trying. Masha, have you ever kissed? Well... Yeah... I mean, like, once, for a second. On the lips. With a boy. Say, you meet a boy. And you, like, fall for him. And let's say you kiss. And then you report him. To cops. Like, you decide to backtrack... I'm not an idiot. You are not... Hey Thrice! She didn't tell me until after that she was thirteen! And she wanted it! I was on my way here, doing my shit. She walks out of the forest, smiling at me. And then after we... When we... After we were done, she got all like "I'll report you!", "My dad's a cop!", "He's a general!"... And you... ...are a dumbass. You know this? Why did you kill her? What if he is a general? What if it backfires? Think I'm gonna cover for you? Moron. Moron. What are you standing around for, dumbass? Hundred knuckle pushups. He left her in the forest. So what's the deal? Yeah? Because that's the way. If it weren't for me, they'd be long dead anyway. Her father is a general. You want me to bury all my people because of one moron? Fine, fine. Right. What? Enjoy your shower. Tanya, I'm sinking in your shoes. But you look pretty. Just move slowly. Good luck! Cupcake. Turn it on already. Stay here. Don't touch him! Get away, I tell ya! Thrice, what are you doing? Thrice! Thrice! - What? - You know you have a daughter?! Are you drunk? You never call her. Not one Birthday. Or Christmas! Kostya, who's that? Quick, what do you want? Leave half the apartment to Masha. It was meant for both of us. You live in it. Fuck off. Everyone is dying. She'll be on her own. She needs to have something! We've been over this. You already got the garage, all the gadgets, two brand new cassette players. You chose to leave, so don't pressure me. - Kostya... - I'll think about it. - Hang on... - I'll think about it. - When? - I told you I'll think about it. Masha... Why so serious? I was born with a straight face. Beautiful face. Do you miss Thrice? Did he kill anyone? Likely. Is it scary - to kill? Not as bad as dying, Masha. Whoever is alive is right. Why did they kill Thrice? It's the 90s. It's you or them. Masha. Do you want Tanya to teach you singing? Why are you laughing? What is it? - Is this yours? - It is mine. Wanna watch a film? Yeah! Have you seen "The Crow"? Are you kidding me? It's the best, full stop! Bruce Lee's son was in it. He was shot dead on set. "Crow". Starring Brandon Lee. Why are you walking me? You're wounded... It's customary for boys to walk girls home. Hey Serge! Walked into a door, I see? See, we haven't heard from you in two weeks. What have you got for us? Not enough. Why is that? You want some? Come on, Serge. Get smart. Keep 'em coming You got some balls, huh. - You know who I am? - Who? Who-who. Who's your overseer? Get lost, shrimp. You want us to fuck up your boy? Do you know Pops? I'm his niece. You got that, Muppets? Touch us - you're dead. Give him the money back. Keep it till tomorrow. If these jerks hustle you for money again, let me know. Hey! Keep safe, Robin Hood. If a man wants some of his blood, I'll cover him with my bod. We're always together! But if he falls for my girl, I won't be there for him no more. Oh God, why is it so that women bring us such woe? That's all. Very good poem. I really like it. - Really? - Yeah. - Really? - I'm dead serious. It's the coolest poem ever. Almost like Mayakovsky. Like Mayakovsky... Yeah! That was really cool. Wow! Ok, let me read you some more. Okay. This one. Latest stuff! The sun warms the soil, the grass is bright and green. We share our joys and toil... Hello. What are you doing here? I wanna start boxing, how do I get to the gym? Keep it up! Keep it up! Do you remember Sergey? Ah, sure, I do. No hard feelings, bro. No worries. I'll kick your ass in the ring. Where's the other one? He got killed, man. - You're wet... - So what? And sweaty. And wet. Watch the legs! Keep the distance. No, no, no. No, come on, don't punch me! I always wanted blue eyes. Me too. A brush is the most important thing in a mascara. Foreign ones are fine, but ours are shit. You need to trace along the edge... Don't blink. Hey... Go comfort your friend. Keep still, don't try to stand up. Sit up. Smell this. Look here. Masha. Masha. Here, listen to some music. I won't find any jazz for this. Well, listen to something else. Now go. Come on, get up. Hello. Are you here for mum? Are you Masha? Well, yeah. And I'm Alla, Sergey's mother. Nice to meet you. Masha, I don't want you to speak to my son ever again. And don't come over. Why? Sergey can make up his own mind. Don't order me around. They are thugs, murderers. And they'll make Sergey do it, too. They are boxers. You're talking rubbish. Boxers! They terrorize the whole city! They killed our neighbor, and he has two children - that's no boxing! You're lying. They kill, and rob, and give you the loot. Let me go already! Idiots. Haven't you had enough? Are you really into boxing? Don't know yet, Masha. I'm yet to figure it out. Why? Maybe you shouldn't box at Pops'. Why not? Those guys stopped harassing me at last. You used to do karate, right? Maybe you should keep doing that. You don't get to tell me what to do. You are not my mother, or my girlfriend. If I'm not - why do you keep walking me? - Don't have to! - Go on then! Easy, easy! What kind of a joke is that? Are you from Sergey? Shut it, bitch! Are you fucking stupid? What are you laughing at? Sit still! Next left. I told you to shut it! It'll get easier, Nadya. Have some water. Drink, and you'll feel better. You'll see. Nadya, relax. Nadya, come on, drink... Nadya. It'll all be good, we'll get her out, you hear me? It'll all be good. Say it. Say it. Say it now! It'll all be good... Leave children the fuck out of this! Blue? He's not a child. He's a grown ass man. You have my word. You have my word. If it's the mill - let's fucking talk. Take Owl. Or me. That's fair game. But a child! Need any help? So what? You have my word. Take the mill. I take Masha. What? I told you. You have my word. So that's that. That's that! Can I be of use? Get lost, Businessman. The only time you were useful is when you were slow to pull out. You got a white fly in your blue trousers. Yeah, my gran sewed that in. What are you talking to her about, huh? What are you grinning at? I could sing you a song if you want. Tanya just taught me. But it's in English. A love song. I'll go. We didn't do anything to her, I swear! We just did it for the money. It's ok, it's ok, my dear... Easy, easy... It's okay, you'll be all right. Don't do this, I beg you! Easy, easy. It's ok, my dear... Nadya, I am sorry. I'm not like your brother, or his... fellows. I can't even protect you and Masha. What do you want? Can you come out for a sec? Hang on... Sorry, Masha. It's all my fault. Pops? May I? Go on. Guys... Let's drink to Masha's 13th birthday! I wish her to live better than us. To Masha! Happy Birthday! To Masha! How long is he going to interrogate him? Not much longer, I think. The oil mill blew up, they're just questioning those close to Pops. Nadya, Nadya, can I have a word with you? Nadya, marry me. Are you mad? Nadya, I love you. If you did, you wouldn't propose. I don't want to bury you. Nadya, I'm very careful. Masha... Do you want this man to freak out? Lower the balloon. Try not to piss yourself. Give it to me. Read it. "I covered you with dust and went bust; I'll never adjust." "The sky is smokin'; I've left you with ash, and you're chokin'." Red is a poet! There's a whole notebook of this stuff! Read some more! "Bless you, Brother, bless you..." What are you doing? He left, and you... Freaks. This is like Mayakovsky. Oh, come on, Masha. "Mayakovsky"... Here. Take it back. Why the grudge? Come on, Masha. Mayakovsky, how do you like that? And left us with ash. So what. Here to bully us again? Want to rob us of our home? Leave us without a roof? You can't threaten us with your thug friends. For each bully there's a bigger bully. Beat it! And forget this address. ...look at it, he's down. What did I tell you when you were getting divorced? You remember? "Let's take the apartment". What did you say to me? "No, please, don't!" I'm fed up with your cheap pride. Watch him! There you go! I should get away... You know what's the difference between us? What are you looking at? I'm honest. And you're not. If someone hits me, I hit back. You don't want to be hurt either. But you are too afraid to throw a hit. You're a chicken. Leave the apartment, you hear me? All right, okay! Swear to me. As I live and breathe. That's all the cash for today. You need anything? Cocoa and soda, otherwise we're good. I see. Hey Andrei! What's up. Get outta here. Get the fuck outta here! Enough! Enough, enough! Cut it out. - Hi. - Hey! What's this? This is your suitcase. We're moving to Samara, to Aunt Natasha's. The train leaves at 8 PM. If you need to say goodbye - go make your calls. After dinner we're off to the station. I didn't take the winter clothes - we'll pick it up later. Look, mom, you didn't even ask me what I want to take! There's, like, a gazillion shoes left in the corridor... My favourite sandals... All right, go get your sandals, you have two hours. Masha! - Where is she? - Come on, Nadya, calm down. Don't let her take me away! Leave me be! Come, come, Nadya. Let's go talk. Get off me! Get off her. Don't you know your daughter? She's thirteen now. Have some respect. I know: the factory closed down, you're out of job... But, you know, relax, Nadya. I've traded vouchers for two new suitcases. We'll get far away from you. You are not right, and you don't live right. The times are wrong, Nadya, we just go with them. Times change, people make choices. There is no real choice, you know. It's you or them, I know, you said it a thousand times. But that IS the choice, you know? Right, Igor? I hate him. - Who? - Pops. Myself. Everyone. I would have killed them all if I could. I love you. Stop boxing. The whole country is in shambles, ruined, and you are giggling. We didn't ruin it. Let's talk something nice. Yeah, like boxing. Or biathlon. That's where you learn to shoot. Tanya and I... We decided to get married. My dear babies! Valera, you're a lucky guy! - Congratulations! - So lucky! Tanya - not as much, but you are! Congratulations! Let's celebrate! What's there to celebrate? How are you going to take care of her? You think you're capable to handle such responsibility? I'm asking you. You want me to take your place? Because I'm not fucking going to. My place? Who do you think you are? Your job is to stay out of this and work with the governor. Your son has just proposed. And you sit here stinking like a piece of shit. Everyone is a piece of shit. Where do you plan to live - in my apartment? You proposed... What exactly did you propose? To fuck her legally? - Igor. I will set my own goals. And will take care of myself and my wife. Let's go. Hey Sergey. Hey. What, doing a runner? Ran out of steam? You know that Pops is banging Tanya, right? What? Masha told me. He probably set Thrice up, too. He doesn't give a shit about you, just covering his ass. I won't fuck you up this time, for Masha's sake. Get lost, kid. You're losing your grip. Pops, Tanya... Who did this to you? Valera. Owl told him. And Pops proposed. Here, have it. You can wear it, or sell it. Why are you sitting down? You came here to study. Come on, sing! Sing! Sonny! Mother! Look at you, such happy faces! Welcome! Come on, chop-chop. Tanya, my beautiful girl! Let's get out of here. I said let's go! Kiss! Kiss! Let's take a picture! What? You got a camera? Yeah! Come on, just hurry up, or we'll boil alive. Mommy, give us a smile! Smile everyone! Good. Let's go, Tanya. Why are you not eating? Don't feel like it. This one is funny. Yeah. What are you doing? It's tasty. Work your legs, work your legs. Tighter. Oh, hi. I heard you forgot to say goodbye. You can't just leave like that, you know? Why so impolite? And you didn't return the gloves that I gave you. That's no good. I'm just not that into boxing. What? I just realized it's not my thing, that's all. So I left. Look me in the eye. I didn't know I have to inform you. Fine. You'll go with Owl to talk over the oil mill. That'll count as your goodbye. Then you can leave. Keep the gloves to remember the good times. What's the progress on Businessman? Nothing yet. We can finish off his stalls if you like. Fuck that. Torch him and take the apartment. Where's his bimbo with the baby? He sent them to her parents in Novokuznetsk. Good. Less sins. What about Masha? How many times has she seen her father? Get on with it. Calm down, no one is coming for you. No. Where are you, anyway? Where?! All right, I'll be right there. They took away all my stalls. This morning they burned down my car. I told him to leave you alone. I'll talk to him again, don't worry - they'll go away. And you don't have to give Masha the whole apartment. Just a half. How's she? Who? Masha. She sings. All your jazz from your vinyls. She's good, you know. She'll be a singer. Didn't go to those dances for nothing. Remember, when you were pregnant? Yeah, right. Remember, how I fought for you when you got pushed? Those two kicks you gave someone when you got scared? That's no fight. Yeah. You were perfect pregnant. So calm, never moody. I've been drinking a lot lately. You need to take Masha away. We're going to Samara. And what's in Samara for her? It's all the same there. You need to take her abroad, to another country. What kind? To a magic land far, far away? Hey buds! Hey Owl, you good? I'm good, you good? Hey guys! Professor? Hey Owl. You got fresh meat? Don't be shy, say hello. Excuse us. All right? Yeah, you? Will do. It won't last. They're dated, dead weight. Hear me out: make a grand and move to America. You in? No. Sergey! There was a mix-up, Professor. Pops sends his apologies. Andrei... Andrei! Masha! My God, Andrei! Andrei... So that was you singing? You're in Moscow now! Andrei! I thought it was you! Andrei... How could this be? I don't know! How could this be? What are you doing here? The radio station director invited me. Timofeev...Tyufeev... Timofeev. I'm buying this club. Fancy. Yeah, fancy-shmancy. I have a proper music business here in Moscow, all kinds of things. Have a couple of music halls around the country. Opening a bunch of jazz clubs. Wow, in mom's memory? It's a profitable business. It fits 1500 people. Yeah. We'll put huge speaker portals up there... Yeah, look how cool you grew to be. You know, I'm gonna open two more halls in six months... Oh, yeah? Yeah. Would you like to sing at the opening? Wow, a real business card? Yeah, and a gun. Masha! Yeah? What? Pops ordered me to kill your father. I didn't know Nadya was staying the night. Your mother died tragically with your father. Masha, they're both dead. We'll punish everyone. I promise you, we'll rip those bastards to pieces. Get your hands off me! Cunts! Masha... I... I just... I just learned your last name. And it's Zyuzin! Zyuzin Andrei, have you ever thought of killing him? Maria Konstantinovna, welcome home, welcome! Thank you so very much for agreeing to perform at the opening! Of course, it's my home town after all. Exactly, you have no idea how much this means to us, how much this centre means to us! Andrei graced us like a God. From the ruins of a puppet theatre, he raised such a beauty! Heart of culture! People will come here again and again and... So this is the hall. It fits 600. There'll be a screen behind that curtain. We'll show movies with live orchestra music. It's very in. Come on. You question my investments. So I'm showing you... I don't need you to show me. Businessman. Hurry up, I need to pee! Tanya, I'm sick of you already! Drunken monkey. Pops! Subtitling: FAST TITLES MEDIA
