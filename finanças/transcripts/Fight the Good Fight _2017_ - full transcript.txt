When have you seen your Dad? We're about to. No, your real dad, Shaw's just your stepdad. Like I said, we're about to. You need to focus. Don't speak unless spoken to. If my da asks you anything, you answer straight away. Ain't his work card a reason to get in? I'm serious. (LAUGHING) 2nd of May, 1974, guess who walks into the gym? Sugar Ray. What, Leonard? Sugar Ray Leonard. Was about two years before he won the gold in Montreal. The slickest boxer on the planet. He looked like a starving kid. (LAUGHING) Jesus Christ. So he steps in the gym. Next thing, he's on the banks. Jumping rope and lacing up to spar. Did you get to talk to him? Ray? Aye. I did better than that, I went five rounds with him. Shit. Well come on, how'd you do? Well I didn't put him on his arse, if that's what you're asking. But he didn't put me on mine either. I held my own. After the five rounds, he says to me, do you want to go another round? (LAUGHS) Well? I'm standing there with a swollen eye and blood running down my nose. I said, "Absolutely, let me go and get my gun first." (LAUGHING) Come on. PATRICK: Fuck off. Da'. Nice of you to drop by. PATRICK: So, what are we gettin' up to tonight, lads? A wee mind. So, you're Danny? Ya, he's the boxer... I wasn't asking you. Your boss says you're a pretty good fighter and your da was a champion. Went by the name of The Highlander. Aye, not anymore though. What, you're not a good fighter anymore? No, my dad. He's works over at the uni. So, what are you doing here down in the docks with a prick green? Why don't you make a name for yourself, go pro, like your da? It's not my scene. And stealing from containers is? Kids these days, all bent out of shape. I didn't go pro either, I preferred fighting on the cobbles. He was a champion too, ya know. DESMOND: Aye, of some sort. Right, let's clean up the mess. JADE: Do you ever get like cravings and shit? Aye, ice cream, I can't eat enough of it. Well that's hardly a craving. I mean everyone likes ice cream, right? I read this thing on Facebook, there was this woman and she had a craving for coal. It was like pictures of her eating it and everything, it was proper fucked up. Do you want kids? Uh, no, kids are gross. Shit. What the fuck happened here? Tony here, fucked up. You didn't give them enough air, did ya Tony? Now we're a delivery short. DESMOND: What am I gonna tell the Russians now? You said he could be fucking trusted. I was I supposed to know he wouldn't let them get some air? Christ, one's still alive. So there is. Bring her out. Move. On your knees. (CRYING) Please. DESMOND: Take this. What for? Don't ask questions, just take it. Tommy's bit of fun on the journey. Too busy sucking cock up on deck. I imagine you know how to use one? I don't understand? It's not rocket science, shoot her. Please. (CRYING) Da. How many times do I have to tell you? Keep your mouth shut. No, I won't do it. How can I trust you, if you don't shoot her? I'm not gonna shoot an innocent girl, for fuck sake. How do I know you won't go to the police? Or her, for that matter? Christ, just pay her to keep her mouth shut, please. If I had a pound the amount of times I heard that. Don't do this. Just get on with it for fuck sake, we ain't got all night.

I've been training for months. Billie you'll get - your chance. - I'm ready. Don't worry, you'll get your chance, okay? Boxing's based on discipline. There's no point rushing into the ring ahead of your time or you'll end up punch drunk, okay? Yeah, all right. Go on. You're here tomorrow, right? Of course. See ya. Harvey, what you talking to those guys about? What? Don't play stupid. Nothing, just a bit of business. Business, in the gym? Yeah. What business? Are you in on this? Listen, relax, it's no big deal. This gym is for the kids. To get them off the street, not put them back on it. What's wrong with you? What do you want to do, hit me? Don't fucking touch me. MAN: Yeah, just over there. Can I help you? OFFICER: Are you Robert McCray? Aye, who's asking? OFFICER: We have some news about your brother. (DOWNBEAT MUSIC) (STUDENTS CHATTING) Okay, we'll be continuing with how classical authors had huge cultural and moral influence. Aand honing in on the ways in which, where's that gone now? In which styles transmitted from one author to another. Now, who can tell me what stylometry means? My vision still impaired from last night? Is half my class missing? Sammy, can you pay attention please? Where is everyone? AMY: We weren't expecting you. Amy, would you care to elaborate? I just said we weren't expecting you. Oh, who were you expecting, Hemingway? George Orwell, perhaps? To be fair sir, you haven't turned up all week. I am sorry about that. I've not been... William, can I have a quick word? Professor Hines will be taking over your class. PROFESSOR HINES: Right everyone, where were we? If this is about last week, I had a lot on my plate. William, that conversations is for another day. Here they come. Hey William. Come here. Charlie, what are you doing here? Hello, I'm Detective Inspector Thomas. We'd like a moment with you to talk about your son. Which one? Danny. Can I get a go on that? So how'd it happen? They found him at the docks with severe injuries to his head and back. We checked his mobile and your phone was the last number called last night, around nine o'clock. I didn't answer it. An answer message perhaps? Is that all? William, relax, we need to ask these questions, it's protocol, that's all. You know as well as I do, I don't talk to my sons. You have to speak to Robert. I didn't mean any disrespect. Like I said, you have to speak to Robert. Sorry William, we don't want to keep you. But if there is anything you can give us that might help with the investigation, then don't hesitate to call me. See, I can't imagine what you're going through just now. But work aside, I'm here for you. Look, here's my card. If you can't get through to your brother, I'm here to help. (SNIFFLING) RECORDING: You have one new message. First new message. (IMPACTS THUDDING) (SCREAMING) No! No, no, no, no, no, no! (HEAVY BREATHING) No! (CHURCH BELLS RINGING) 1 Timothy 6, reads as follows, aim at righteousness, godliness, faith, love, steadfastness, gentleness. Fight the good fight of faith. As we gather to remember Danny's life, we recall that he fought the good fight as a man of faith. As a son, and as a friend. Three words. (WILLIAM WHISPERING) PRIEST: William. (GENTLE DOWNBEAT MUSIC) The poet, Robert Frost... The poet Robert Frost... The poet Robert Frost once wrote, "All I have learned of life "can be put in three words." It goes on. Robert. William. Hey, come here. Great speech. Thank you. How're you holding up? It's a blur. Aye, I can imagine. Robbie didn't stay long. Hmm, we're still not talking. Hey, look at me. If you need anything, you let me know, okay? They still got some of his personals down at the station. Why don't you come by tomorrow and pick them up? I can do that. - BOTH: Daddy. - Hey. Say hello to your uncle. Come. You let me know when you're coming tomorrow, aye? Come on girls. The good fight. (DOWNBEAT MUSIC) What, you're bored? I'll tell you what, I'm fucking bored. ♪ Danny Boy ♪ The pipes, the pipes are calling ♪ From glen to glen ♪ Down the mountain side Courage, serenity and wisdom, aye? Eh? Fat good you did me! Stevie Wallace the other day. Disaster of his put an end to that. Anyway, this is it. I wasn't expecting you so early. Best to get it over with. Aye, understandable. All right, well this is it. Can you give me a minute? Aye, of course. I'll be out in the hallway. Don't touch anything else, eh? (GENTLE DOWNBEAT MUSIC) You get everything? Aye. Hello again. You said my son was associated with some criminals, who? We know he's close friends with a guy named Patrick. He's a step-son of an ex-con named Shaw. Have you brought him in yet? We can't without sufficient evidence. WILLIAM: Aye, there's a photo of Danny and girl. Jessica was his girlfriend. Mm hmm. She's pregnant, William. Okay. So what's next? You gonna speak to this Shaw? Aye, I'll send down a few guys, ask some questions. But in the meantime, if you see either of them, stay clear. Fine. Your brother seems wired. Give it a rest, will you? How would you feel if you just lost a son? Hey Jessica, you up? I've got some food for ya. I've got some ice cream. (KNOCKING AT DOOR) Hey Jess. If you don't want eat for you, eat for your baby, come on Jess. (KNOCKING ON DOOR) It's not healthy, you being in here like this. You need to keep windows open. Get some fresh air. I know what happened is terrible, but you have to stay healthy for the baby's sake. My brother would kill me if he knew I wasn't looking out for you. So give us a chance. Please. So, modern authors are being influenced by their contemporaries rather than writers from the 18th and 19th centuries. Surely we can still respond to great ideas in Shakespeare or Homer or not. Christ it's hot in here. You don't say much, do ya? I think it's because contemporary writing is well, more contemporary. Stories with subject matter such as fashion and sex are more relatable to our generation. Okay, very good. (BELL RINGING) Right, that's all for today. Have nice weekends. Mr. McCray? Amy, you don't need to call me Mr. McCray, William's fine, I feel so bloody old otherwise. What can I do for you? I just wanted to let you know that there's been rumors around school about why you haven't been in. Oh, like what? I just wanted to say I'm sorry for what I said in class the other day. If that happened to me, I wouldn't be in either, I don't think anyone would be. Okay, you don't need to worry about that... And don't worry about us. Be with your family. Chin down, heads up, come on. Nice Billie, stick the jab. Nice, real nice. All right enough fella, come on take it easy on her. Come on Billie let's work, come on. That's nice! Stick the jab, come on. Come on Billie let's work! Come on, let's move it! Soft, go a bit softer, come on. Come on, take it easy. MEAT: Come on! That's nice, stick the jab, come on. MEAT: Come on, come on. Hey Jesus! Fuck, that's enough. What's wrong with you? (MEAT LAUGHING) (OMINOUS MUSIC) Let me have a look. Maybe he's right. Maybe I shouldn't be doing this. Aw hey, don't let anyone tell you what you can and can't do. If he wants to be stuck in the stone age then you let him do that. Just worry about yourself and what you want to do, okay? Okay. Okay. Yeah. Is it true? What? Your brother got murdered. Right, get yourself cleaned up. Hey Billie. That's good work. WILLIAM: Robert. What? I need to talk son. No. About Danny. I don't care, nothing's changed. - Wait a sec, wait a sec. - No. Not right now all right? I'm leaving. We can go and get a drink. What makes you think I want to have a drink with you? Now you listen to me, take off your gloves. - Oh come on. - And you go over here. You're drunk already I can fucking - smell it on ya. - I'm not drunk. No, I mean really. It takes one of your sons to die before you can come talk to me? Did you know Danny was murdered? He was beaten to a pulp, and I know that because he called me the night. He called me. He called you? Aye, but I didn't pick up. I thought maybe you could tell me... I thought you came to see me. Did come to see you but I thought maybe... You don't even care about me. You're only here to find out about Danny aren't you? I came to... Get my son back. (GENTLE DOWNBEAT MUSIC) CHARLIE: So how was your date last night? Short. No coffee afterwards then? We match on Tinder, decide to go for a drink. Hear about his day before he even asked about mine he's more concerned what was underneath my skirt. So yes, short. Men aye? So they're telling us there are no CCTV cameras pointed toward the area where he was killed, why do I find that hard to believe? A trading company doesn't have funds to keep cameras on the whole site 24/7, down at 8:00. BERNADETTE: It doesn't feel right. What do you think? About Tinder? That doesn't feel right. Patrick. I'm gonna pay him a visit. He seems to be the weak link in this operation. Maybe we can make him flip. Well that isn't a good idea is it? The last thing we want is Shaw to think we're on his case. That's exactly what we want. Start on operations until we convict him. Don't make me pull rank Bernadette. Just relax. We will get the person responsible. Look, so what do we know, hmm? We know Shaw. He's definitely got some kind of link to this human trafficking racket. Let's just sit tight and see how things develop, aye? 'Cause I know one of they bastards most definitely killed my nephew, but we can bring down more than just a man with a gun. We need to nail the bastard that finances the gun remember? Cold. But true. (CROWD SHOUTING AND CHEERING) Well what is this? You said a small event. If the council found out about this they're gonna close us down. Don't be a faggot, just relax. No one's gonna find out. First the drugs and now unlicensed boxing? I could wring your neck. Oh fuck sake. WILLIAM: Robert. Robert. Not right now all right? WILLIAM: Listen, I need to speak with Jessica. What? WILLIAM: Jessica. No I heard what you said. Good. So do you know where I can find her? No. Okay a number then. What is your problem? Why do you want to see her? Son she's carrying my grandchild. Yeah, and like I'm gonna let you near her. Listen... No I'm not listening to you. No one is useless in this world. He lightens the burdens of another. What? Dickens. Here we go with all your attempt at wisdom. Whoopdte fucking doo! Mom was the smart one. The suit don't fit. Don't take another fucking step until I've said my piece. Danny's gone, we've lost him. It's tearing me apart that I wasn't there for him, but I can be there for Jessica and the baby, now please. Robert. People are waiting, we need another fighter. Tennison's all ready. ROBERT: What? I'm not gonna help you. You taught that, throw one of the kids in. Are you mad? No way! No! What are you on about no way? Who are you to say that? Who are you? You get one of your boys. I'll fight Meat. You, who are you you jackass. (ARGUING LOUDLY) I'll give you 10. You're a village boy. I'll give you 10 minutes. - Sort this out. - I'm sorry mate, come on. (DOWNBEAT MUSIC) Why are you doing this? (CROWD CLAMORING) Who's that? When I say break, I mean break. Got that? Get back to your corners. He swings big. Move around, make him miss. Ready? Let's fight. (CROWD CLAMORING) (BLOWS IMPACTING) Break! None of that! Fight! (CROWD CHEERING) He's out! (CROWD CHEERING AND SHOUTING) See? Wasn't so hard was it? Whatever. HARVEY: He's a good fighter. Where'd you find him. ROBERT: He's my father. HARVEY: Sweet. I'd best be off. I'll be in touch. ROBERT: I'm sure you will. No, you keep it. About Jessica. Look, I know what you're trying to do but now is not the right time. So when is? You fighting for me doesn't immediately put things back together. If you really care you'll give her the space that she needs. Understood. And don't be coming down here uninvited again. I know where to find you if I need you. (GENTLE DOWNBEAT MUSIC) (JESSICA CRYING) (OMINOUS MUSIC) I got this. Okay. You ordering food? Aye. (OMINOUS MUSIC) May I sit? My boy tells me you put on quite a show down at the gym tonight. AMY: Coffee? I'll have what he's having sweetheart. So why'd you fight? You tight for money? No. You chasing the adrenaline? I know, it's appealing. I used to fight myself. I have a problem. Your little show down at the gym cost me a fighter. His jaw is broken and he can't fight next week. So, you gonna help me fix my problem and fight for me? I have my own problems. You know who I am? I've heard of you. You're a suspect in my son's murder. Am I now? You're brave. I can respect that. Say your piece and leave. When I was a kid my ma used to make these brownies. They were to die for. Now, the rule was you could only take one, but I couldn't help myself. I would take two or even three. My older brothers would beat the shit out of me for taking theirs. It wasn't that I was being greedy. Sometimes I wasn't even hungry. I just like getting into trouble, and I liked taking what was not mine. What's your point? (SLAMMING TABLE) Wakes up the senses doesn't it? So you can fight for me, and then you can get on with your life as if we never met. If I don't? Then I will find you. And I will take something from you. My boy, I didn't see him for three years, and he calls me up the night he died. All I heard was the sounds of him getting beaten to death. Now you're telling me you weren't involved. If you were, you won't need to come find me. I'll find you. Enjoy your coffee. Give me a call when you've made your decision. Who was that? My new friend. So, you work here. No, I just like wearing the uniform. It is a nice uniform. (GENTLE DOWNBEAT MUSIC) Hey, you awake? I just want to let you know that, you're not alone in this. Okay? Amy. Oh. What are you still doing here? Thought I'd escort you home. Bit late to be walking on your own. Yeah, sure. Where do you live? Saint Mary's. Whoa, you train there? Yeah, you regretting your offer? Course not, anyway I've committed. Come on, let's go. Okay. (DOWNBEAT MUSIC) Does it hurt? What, my face? No. Back does. Too old to be boxing. Why'd you do it? Primal instinct? It's the will to fight. I tell ya, you may not believe it but it's an amazing experience getting punched in the face and finding out you're not made of glass. It's almost poetic. (LAUGHING) Almost, aye. Do you get on with your folks? Yeah. Now anyway. Now? My parents never wanted me to do English. Why not? They wanted me to joint the family business. Oh? IT. I finally saw they started to appreciate me for who I was. How come you chose English? Are you kidding? (LAUGHING) I could spout all day about it. Go on then. I think it's fascinating how even though mankind has changed so much over the last 1,000 years, the same basic themes endure in literature. And the devotion and time people spend on novels that they choose to read and how that novel because part of your life for that week or two that you're reading it. You know I've often thought that something was missing in my life, and I thought if I could just read everything and consume everything I'd find out what that was but... Ah, I won't bore you with the details. So, what? You committed all that to memory just in case someone asked you? Nice work. And you? Literature? That's for another day.

What did we tell you? What did you tell me? You snooping around isn't helping the situation. I'm not snooping. You been talking to Shaw? How'd you know that? Because we're having him monitored. He approached me. Can I get in? Give us a second will ya? Why are you on my case? Look I have to ask you, where were you on the night of Danny's murder? At home, I told you already. Well a caretaker of the university says you were here late, left about 8:00 p.m. Aye, I was working late. What am I a suspect now? No, I'm only asking because your number on his phone is the only piece of evidence we have. Aye I heard. With modern technology you'd expect a wee bit more wouldn't you? Sounds to me like someone's hiding something. Oh come on. How else are they getting away with this Charlie? They're not. They are, they are, this fucking prick Shaw, have you even questioned him yet? You know he got right up in my face and practically admitted to killing my son. William you need to go home and get some rest. You look exhausted. Christ I hate seeing you like this. You're grieving. You need to be with your family. My family. I'm gonna ask you one more time. Have you questioned Shaw yet? How can you sit here telling me what to do about my son's murder when you're not even doing your job properly. Hey! I loved your son like was my own right. Is that right? Then how come you're here in my car with me instead of out there finding the person fucking responsible for this. Just calm down. I tell you what Charlie, get the fuck out. - Get the fuck out! - All right! Aye I'm going. Good. (GENTLE MUSIC) Robert? Oh fuck! Fuck! Hey, hey! Talk to me. Speak to me, say something to me! Help! NURSE: It'll be a moment. What have you done? What have you done? Get the fuck off me! (ROBERT YELLING) I fucking hate you. Jessica! Jessica. Jessica. Green tea. With toast every morning. Are you okay? What happened to you? Danny always made it for me. Your son was good like that. I miss him so much. You're all right. Never trusted that Patrick. What? No, why did I let him do it? He said we needed some money for the baby and I agreed with him I don't know. Hey, hey, hey, hey Jess, what do you know, Jess? Jess, what do you know? I was there the night he got killed. Are you sure she's telling the truth? She nearly died today. Tried to take her own life so she could be with my son God's sake. She's not lying, why would she? I'll ride up, just relax. If she is telling the truth then this is no joke William. No shit. Leave her with me. You need to lie low, go home and wait for my call, okay? No, it's too risky to take her home. As soon as Shaw finds out she was there he'll be after her. Assuming he doesn't know already. William I don't know if I can protect you. He has people everywhere, including the police. You got a better idea? Aye, go to the old cottage. You'll be safe enough there. Okay. Keep me posted. Listen I gotta go, I'll speak to you in a bit, okay? All right, bye. All right let's check the crates in the back. But we've still got a few left. CHARLIE: Nah, this place is dry. Too out in the open. Come on. (GENTLE MUSIC) Jessica, I've got something for you. So when's it due? Four weeks. Hell of a bump. It's a boy. When Danny was a boy we used to call him bumpy. Before he got contacts he had glasses, which he never wore, he hated them. But he used to chase Robert through the living room and got smacked into the door frame everyday. His head used to come up like a cartoon. It's crazy how the time goes. I'll go pack your things. Can I say something? Of course. I'm so sorry. For... I know how selfish it was and I won't ever forgive myself. Don't explain yourself, you don't have to. You're alive. You're healthy. The baby's healthy. You can start rebuilding your life. I don't know how much Danny told you about why we never talked but, I used to think I had the perfect life too. I did, I had a boxing career. I broke my back. Lost it. Danny's mom got ill with cancer, and just when I thought things couldn't get any worse, I became this, awful dad. Social services took my boys away. You know the expression all that can happen to you will happen to you? Well it's true. In my case it was anyway. What I'm trying to say is a part of me feels that some of that happened because of who I was, because of how I was as a person. So I'm saying be strong. Don't make the mistakes I did. Else your baby's gonna grow to resent you. Danny never resented you. DESMOND: I can't remember where you went wrong boy. Hmm? You thought it would be a good idea to just let them go? I thought you... Don't think! Your brain doesn't have the energy for it. Don't do anything, just go home. Go! PATRICK: Fucking hell. Your brother's becoming a bit of a problem. Well what do you expect? You killed his son. You need to relax Desmond. I'll relax when they're 12 feet under the ground. You need to understand the seriousness of this situation. And how to you propose I sort it, eh? Maybe just turn up, kill them? You're out of your fucking mind. So, what now? They're heading to our late grandmother's house in the highlands. The old cottage. It's where we spent summers as kids. It's quiet there. I'll link you with my son Luke. But you keep my brother and Robbie out of it. Enough of my family's bloods been spilled as it is. This is where I draw the line. (GENTLE MUSIC) This is where you grew up? Aye. It's nice. Need the loo. How you holding up? There's no words to describe how I'm feeling. Do you mind? (GENTLE MUSIC) Used to play this all the time when you were a kid. We'd each choose a piece to represent ourselves didn't we? You remember your favorite? The knight. WILLIAM: Aye. Why was that? It was because of the shape. And how it moved. I'd like to say something. I know I was supposed to be there for you and Danny. When your mother died I should've been there for you. Even more than ever, but I couldn't grasp the situation and I just imploded, and I left you both. But you didn't do anything wrong, you know that? How could you have done? My beautiful boys. And I tried to swallow all my memories with booze and medication. Tried to forget I had a family, but of course I couldn't. What really haunts me is I know I failed you both, and I know it's probably too late and you hate me, but I would like to be a part of your life. If you'll have me. (GENTLE MUSIC) (OMINOUS MUSIC) Shit. Shit! What? Who is it? WILLIAM: Shaw's son. ROBERT: Patrick? WILLIAM: The other one! ROBERT: What are we gonna do? Take her in there, hide her. Why have you got a sword? What? Hide her! Come here. JESSICA: What's going on? You know they're here for you right? And I need to keep you safe. I can help. No, you can't. - Yes I can! - No. - Jess, you can't. - Robert I can! Robert. Well here he is. Where is she? Not here. Put the fucking blade down. Don't be a hero. We know she's here. (LAUGHING) Let's have a bit of fun. (GRUNTING AND IMPACTS STRIKING) A fucking samurai sword? Fuck's sake. Fucking bastard. Shit. Where the fuck did you come from? Stop it! Stop it! (LAUGHING) I'd put that down darling before you get hurt. Don't take another step. What you gonna do? Shoot me? You don't have the nerve darling. Go on. Jessica. Right there. Jessica give me the gun. Do it. (LAUGHING) Jessica, darling, darling, you give me the gun. Oh give us a break. You're no better. You're not gonna shoot me. Get in the car. Do you know why I know you won't shoot me? Because it's not in your blood. You know I was there the night Dan got killed. All for not pulling a trigger? (LAUGHING) Scared little bitch he was. Just like his da. (LAUGHING) Don't. Won't it feel good. Why not? (LUKE SHOUTING) (GUN FIRING) ROBERT: Da, come on! Come on! How'd they find us? WILLIAM: I don't know. It had to be Uncle Charlie, no one else knew. 'Cause you wouldn't listen to what I said. Me? Yes you. I told you to stay in the house. I told you to take care of yourself. Are you fucking serious? JESSICA: Right, if it wasn't for me you'd both be fucking dead. ROBERT: Oh yeah, you could've killed yourself as well. - Fucking serious man! - Calm down. ROBERT: No I'm not gonna calm down! Yeah I know what's happened. Calm the fuck down. (DOWNBEAT MUSIC) We better get going. He's not gonna stop you know. What? Shaw. He won't stop. I'm gonna have to talk to him. And how do you plan on doing that? He owns a club right? ROBERT: And? Why don't you take me there? Are you crazy? Son. See now I know why you were the way you where when I was growing. See you're not right in the head. Robert. No! Robert. Look. Who are you? I'm you father's who I am. Aye where you there when I was growing up? Oh what? I said where you there when I was growing up? No. Then you're not my father. I know it doesn't make up for what I did but I'm telling you I'm gonna change. Clearly. Your mother died in my arms. She left me son. Now Danny's gone. You have to understand, I need you to understand I'd do anything to keep you safe and Jessica too. You've got a lot of nerve talking about love. And safety? So tell me what to do? You really are a sad little man. Do you know I'm not surprised that you made a mess of things. You have no idea what you're doing do you? No, you're right. You were supposed to rise to the occasion and be a father because Danny needed you and I needed you, and you're our father and you neglected us! At least you managed to keep your job, eh? It's all I have left of your... What about us? - Stop it! - What about us? You know what, you make me sick! You're so blind you can't see that we're a part of her, and we was right in front of you the whole fucking time! Just get out, go kill yourself, I don't give a shit! Aye. If you don't trust Charlie, go speak to his partner. Detective Sergeant something or other. You're gonna let him walk away like that? Fuck! Fuck. (PHONE VIBRATING) Are you gonna answer that? No. Well who's calling you then? I don't know. Who do you think? Hello? ED: Hi, is Patrick there? It's Ed. Yeah? ED: Patrick. It's about your brother. He was shot. So what are you saying? ED: He's dead Patrick. Love you too. (ENERGETIC PULSING MUSIC) Hello handsome. I'm waiting for someone. Just trying to be nice. Do you have kids? One, you? Two. Nature calls, I'll talk to you more when I get back. Sure you will. Do you know who this is? CHARLIE: No. Doesn't matter. What matters is you have the balls to finish the job. PATRICK: Da. DESMOND: What are you doing here? PATRICK: I wanted to talk with you. I swear to Christ you'll be the death of me boy. What is it? It's Luke. He's dead. What? He's dead Dad. Shoot him. Jesus Christ man, you've just been telt your son's dead. An eye for an eye. Now shoot him. Shoot him! No. And where the fuck's he going? Your house. Now it looks like you shouldn't have given me this then. There's only one bullet in it. Use it shoot him, you and your family walk free. You bastard. Your twins will be upstairs with my girls tonight. You're sick. You an atheist? What's that got to do with anything? Everything. Because if you believe in God you won't shoot him. For fear of burning in Hell for eternity. But if you don't believe in God, there's no issue. Because your family's in danger, and to save them you will shoot him. So, do you believe in God? (GENTLE DOWNBEAT MUSIC) (GUN FIRING) (GUNS FIRING) You wanna prove yourself to me? Bring him to me alive. Go! (ENERGETIC PULSING MUSIC) Guns away, all right. You go that way, I'll go this way. What the fuck's going on? They've got guns. Why have they got guns? You need to sort it out, seriously. You're giving me a fucking headache. Where are you going? Home. You better fucking hope they catch him. (DOWNBEAT MUSIC) WILLIAM: Fuck. Fuck, fuck. Fuck. (GRUNTING AND SCUFFLING) Shit. Amy! What? I need somewhere to hide. What's going on. Can I explain later? Wait here. Where is he? Excuse me? (PATRICK SCREAMING) Give me five minutes. What the hell is going on? It's complicated. Why were those men following you. They still out there? No, no they've gone. Charlie. Who? My brother. He's involved in my son's murder. Oh I'm calling the police. No, no wait! He is the police. I'm going. Wait! Where are you going? I shouldn't have come here, I'm putting you in danger. Stop. Stop, I want to help. So, the rumors, they're true? I'm trying to get to the bottom of everything. It's even worse than I imagined. If that's possible. Amy, I don't think I can fix this. Think you're too small to make a difference? Try sleeping with a mosquito, aye. The Dalai Lama. Very good. Okay. There. Aye. I can't. You're the same age as Robert. Who's Robert? No! I can't. You know I'm not a parent so I can't tell you what to do but if I were you I'd stop hiding. This isn't safe. Robert, we can't... I know, just... Let me think, all right? We have to go to the police. Your dad said... What if he's wrong? Well we don't have very many options do we? We could just leave. Go where? This is our home. Christ, what about your dad? Don't get any ideas. (DOWNBEAT MUSIC) (SIREN WAILING) Fuck! (PHONE VIBRATING) I better take this. William where are you? WILLIAM: Not falling for that one again. Listen to me, you're in this deep now killing his son. Yes man, you lost yours but Jesus Christ. You've gone and got yourself fucking killed, that's what you've done. Why'd you do it Charlie? He had a child on the way and you weren't around to help him. I saw an opportunity for him to make a bit of cash, I never knew it was gonna go down like this. If I did I would never have let it happen. What did you expect was gonna happen? You're police for fuck's sake! You've got to believe me William, you're my brother. I would never put you through this. Spare me your bullshit compassion, it's not real Charlie. You should've just come clean! I was ashamed. I couldn't do anything to help her. You could've done your job. What if I'd done the same to your little girls? Think about that for one second. You know what Charlie, I only called to let you know I'm not going to the police. What you do now is down to you. Oh Jesus Christ. Who's this? Who do you think you fucking cockroach? Just when I was starting to dislike you. Shut the fuck up and listen. I'm coming to you. Why would you do that? WILLIAM: 'Cause I'm tired of running. You know where to find us. Aye I do. Right you, back home. Really? Don't make me tell you again. I can help. Boy! I should've sent you to Scotland. You wish I'd died instead of Luke? Yes. He's coming to us. Get ready. (ENERGETIC PULSING MUSIC) Hey. Where are you going? Got drinks. Leave them. What? Andy I've told you there are no promotions to give at the moment. Yeah I know but I thought that maybe, you know I just saying we could... Uh, sorry. Ma'am there's someone here to see you. I just know that he was there, and he left in quite a hurry so... She's here for you now. You actually came. I'm not afraid of ya. You're brave. Give yourself up like this. Especially after killing my son. You're going to be in a world of pain over the next few days. So, now you're here. Now what? What's your proposition? Simple, you versus me. One on one. You're gonna suffer for what you did to my son. What's stopping me shooting you in the head right now? WILLIAM: I thought you were a fighter? Obviously I was wrong. Are you sure you wanna do this? Never been more sure in my life. (PEOPLE CHATTERING) (GENTLE DOWNBEAT MUSIC) My pathetic stepson. He should've sorted this mess out from the beginning. He let her go, because he doesn't have the vicious gene that you do that's happy to kill a pregnant girl. He gets that from his mother. Shaw. Police are on their way. (SIREN WAILING) ♪ Oh Danny Boy ♪ The pipes, the pipes are calling You're stronger. I'll give you that. Your son was begging for his life when we killed him. Finish him off for me would you? (SHOUTING IN PAIN) Don't fucking move! Or you. (GUN FIRING) Coward! It's over. Not quite. We still have some unfinished business. (LAUGHING) I'll try not to enjoy this too much. (DRAMATIC DOWNBEAT MUSIC) (BLOWS IMPACTING) MAN: And that one's Charlie? MAN: Yeah that's him. Patrick Shaw, I'm arresting you for the murder of Danny McCrae. You don't have to say anything, but it may harm your defense. (GROANING IN PAIN) Bastard! Come on! What's going on? The door's locked ma'am. Then get the bloody ram. - Yes ma'am. - Now! Come on! (BLOWS IMPACTING) (RAM SMASHING DOOR) (GENTLE DOWNBEAT MUSIC) (WILLIAM PANTING) (DOOR SMASHING OPEN) Get a paramedic. Looks like your sons given up on you. I hope you like four concrete walls and a bed. We have to take you sir, we're the police. - Come with us. - Yes. OFFICER: Come this way. (SIREN WAILING) ROBERT: My da, my da is in there. Robert, he's there! Robert, come! OFFICER: Paramedic here. Look at your face. Sorry. It's all right. It's okay, it's all right. You're okay. It's okay, it's okay. It's okay. It's all right. (GENTLE DOWNBEAT MUSIC) WILLIAM: Hey. Oh, hi. Sorry. About the other week. Oh, it's all right. Wasn't your fault. I was worried about you. Well I'm okay, but thank you. So, you're back? No. I quit, just now. Why? A friend did ask me one time why I chose literature, but truth is I never did, it was my wife's passion. I've been living it for her all this time. So, got to let it go. So what are you gonna do now? Do what I should've done years ago. Be with my family. It was good knowing you Amy. (LAUGHING) Likewise William. Be good.
