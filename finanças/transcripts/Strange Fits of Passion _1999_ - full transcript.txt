[police sirens] [jazz music playing] SHE (VOICEOVER): "Now therefore, while the youthful hue sits on my skin like morning dew and while thy willing soul transpires at every pore with instant fires. Now let us sport us while we may. And now, like amorous birds of prey, rather at once our time devour. Than languish his slow-chapt power. Let us roll all our strengths and all our sweetness up into one ball, and tear our pleasures with rough strife-- MR. SELDITT: Darling? Have you finished cataloging the new feminist titles? Mr. Mister Selditt? Hi, yeah, what's happening? What's happening? This is sci-fi. Uh, no, it's not. It's feminist fiction. It's written down. Well, I think that's wrong. How do you know? Have you read it? No, but-- Ah, yes. The [inaudible]. They knew about mating rituals. They really did. The [inaudible] is most definitely a matriarchal society. Female [inaudible] choose their own partners at annual marriage markets. I've been there with them, in spirit, when they perform those strange marriages. Not a bad idea, that. Makes a nice change from doing all the work yourself. Only to be told that she doesn't have time for a cup of coffee with you for a whole year. And you are on the shortlist for a cappuccino. Makes you feel real good, that does. [clearing throat] In with [inaudible]. Excuse me? Would you like to take whatever's in your pants out? [sneezing] [blowing nose] Look, we haven't even met yet. Shouldn't we, uh-- -No. Have a drink? I meant the, uh-- I'm Francis. Please to meet you. Come here. I have to tell you something. One god created love. [jazz music playing] He didn't help most. He made some mistakes. But when he created you lying in bed, he came all over his blessed universe. Fuck off. OK. [rock music playing] I think I've just ruined my one chance at true happiness. Good. Can't stop. Two more. Fuck off! Fuck off! SHE (VOICEOVER): Fuck off. It's a sign of interest! It's a come-on line. Well, I'm done. Yeah. Me, too. SHE (VOICEOVER): Francis would know that. Of course, he would! So what have you done to ruin your one chance at true happiness? I've met someone. Say that again. I've met someone. Oh my god! [screaming] [laughing] Are you coming? [music playing] SHE (VOICEOVER): And so the crusade began. Somewhere in this city was Francis saying to Francis, the man of my dreams, the savior of my sexual soul. Somewhere. But where? Actually, I do know a Francis. You do? And he knows how to give really good head. Does he? I'm joking. Oh, I know. WOMAN (ON TV): Now you think you can walk out of my life without a trace. MAN (ON TV): You can't stop me. WOMAN (ON TV): Oh, yes, I can. MAN (ON TV): You've got nothing on me. WOMAN (ON TV): That's what you think. Blackson? Mmm? WOMAN (ON TV): I know that that's What do you think the audience demographic is for Live Pussy? Slivers. Not chunks, slivers. So? Makes better Hawaiian. No. So? What? So do you think Live Pussy attracts single, young attractive men? I'm in it. So hang on. What? You're just hoping that you'll run into this guy? I hate my clothes. MAN: Blacks? Hey, Blacks! [feet stomping] You never meet anyone when you're looking, you know? BLACKSON: Oh, hey, are you going out? JAYA: Have fun. -I'm not looking. I told you, I met someone. MAN: Are you coming, too? [door banging] I was supposed to be there half an hour ago! What do you think? MAN: Oh, Jaya, it would be nice if you [inaudible]. No. You're trying to hard. JAYA: Yeah, yeah. Whatever. -Just be yourself. Be yourself? [door slamming] What's that supposed to mean? We're all constructed. Do you think there's some pure self that knows what to wear? If you don't want my opinion, then don't ask. Fine. Then I won't. A little bit defensive tonight, aren't we? You coming or not? Yes. Well, hurry up! [door slamming] What does she do to get all the guys? JIMMY: Nothing. Nothing. Right. You don't have to do anything when you're good looking. Can you get out? Shit! [rock music playing] Two for Jaya, for Live Pussy. You looking for someone? Me? No. No. Um-- talk to me. Talk to me really quick. Hurry! Hurry! About something really, really important. Oh. Well, I've-- I've got this really terrible problem and I-- I haven't been able to work out what to do about it, so maybe you-- -OK. He's gone now. Who? Oh, it's just this guy I slept with last week. It was so awful. Two, please. Thanks. You know the sort. Oh, yeah. Yeah, they're the worst. Aren't they? It's like, hello, would you mind learning about a woman's body before you go inflicting yourselves on us. Yeah! I mean-- I mean, don't they have rubber dolls for that sort of thing? I mean-- Exactly. Do they think that we enjoy being grasped at? [jazz music playing] And groped. It's just such a turn off when someone's got no idea what they're doing. [rock music playing] Excuse me. SHE (VOICEOVER): Oh, god, please give me some idea what I'm doing. Please don't let me a turn off. Or at least, please show me a way not to be a turn off. One prick. Right. So if you want a man and you're good looking, then you do nothing. So if you're OK looking and you want a man, what does that mean? You do something? What's something? Excuse me. Don't touch me! SHE (VOICEOVER): Was that something? No. Too defensive. Has anyone ever told you, you look like Catherine in Wandering Hearts? What does she look like? You. SHE (VOICEOVER): Do something else. Something nice. Fuck off? Shit. You want a drink? Oh, yeah, a pint. Thanks. Sorry! No worries. It's a bit hot in here anyway. Actually, I love-- I love your jacket. Yeah, it's pretty cool. Yeah. Is it some kind of suede? Uh, I don't really know. Well, it-- it probably says on the label. Yeah, well, I don't think it's got one. My girlfriend found it for me in a dumpster. Great. Look, I'm sorry-- Thank you. What for? Men have this whole history of patriarchal behavior [inaudible]. And sometimes we forget. And I think it's important that we're reminded that our socially constructed behavior can be potentially offensive. Can I buy you a drink? So what do you actually do? I'm a poet. Really? MAN: Time, please! Time! Time! Thank you! Everyone, you know, wants to write a great novel, but you what? I think authentic art comes from redressing cultural roots. And those roots are white imperial verse. So that's where we need to start. I mean, that's the root of all oppression, isn't it? You're absolutely right. Yeah. I know I am, so that's what I want to change. We haven't seen it before in Australian poetry. I've been so obsessed with folklore and what have you. I mean, how many modern Australians does the whole bush legend thing relate to? I mean, new voices must be heard. What I intend to do with my poetry is redefine the racist, sexist, classist, homophobic legacy that [inaudible] left us with. MAN: Time, please! Time! Time! It's really interesting. Oh, yeah. It is. It is. It's one of the great advantages of post-modernism, the possibilities of inter-textual recreation. We're going to the Night Crocodile to kick on. Do you want to come? Um. Do want to have a coffee and maybe keep talking to somewhere? Yeah. That sounds great. SHE (VOICEOVER): My god. A poet we've with good dress sense, a great nose, and he takes taxis. Hey, can I get a lift with you guys? No. Go away. You ready? I don't have any money. I'll pay. [groaning] Let's go! So how about we just go back to my place? [sneezing] Have you got a cold? No. No, no, no. I've got this great new Guinea blend. [sneezing] Are you OK? Maybe you're allergic to something. No, no. [sneezing] I-- [sneezing] I think-- I think it's just the car freshener. [sneezing] JAYA: Listen to this. Freud's first patient was this woman, Emma Eckstein, right? She had all these psychic sexual problems. So Freud sent her to get a nose operation because he believed that all neurosis was situated in the nasal cavity. Really? How's that? Is that better? [sneezing] Sorry. Bye. Hang on! Listen, uh-- here's my card. Maybe you could give me a call when you're feeling-- when you're feeling better. [sneezing] And my number-- Shit! Shit! Shit! Jimmy? I need help. [music playing] [sex in other room] Doesn't sound like she does nothing. JIMMY: It's not about sex, you know? Yes, it is. No, it's not. Get it into perspective. I mean, you rejected someone. No one rejected you. Think how much worse it is for them. They're the ones brave enough to put themselves on the line and make a move. I've-- I've got this friend who's got this friend who works for Virgin. And I could get them to come and see your band, you know? And maybe they'll give you a recording contract because you are really fabulous. I mean it! You really are! Red socks. It means you're a rebel. So you're saying that whenever I like someone, I subconsciously fuck it up, so that I don't feel rejected. Yeah. You get him first. Oh, god! What am I going to do? Take a risk. Right? Just be honest with them. I can't be honest with Francis. Oh. Well, uh-- why don't you find someone you don't like. [sex in other room] It's just chance. Who we meet, and who we go out, and who we supposedly fall in love with. How can there be true love when the whole thing is so arbitrary? Well, it's not. It's-- it's not arbitrary. Everyone has one, true love. It just takes some people longer to find theirs. Are you saying that god pairs us all off in advance? No. So what if your one, true love dies in early childhood? Or-- or-- or what if your one true love lives in Zanzibar, or Geelong, or somewhere you never go? Oh, well, I guess, that would explain all the single people. I cannot believe what you're saying. You must be a Christian to think this. Hang on, I thought you decided that Francis was your one, true love. Just-- just because I find him att-- attract-- Attra-- attractive? Shh! Do you-- do you-- what-- do you think that monkeys just suddenly decided to start rooting around because they discovered their true loves? Well, I don't know, but we're not talking about monkeys. We're talking about good human beings! There's no difference. Yes, there is. The difference is we can love. To have compassion and empathy for someone other than ourselves, that's what love is. Love is controlling our fantasies and our desires in order to have a true and sustaining relationship with one person. Where do you read that? [rain falling] Do you know how you said before, you never meet anyone when you're looking? Mmm. Where did you meet Simon? Mmm. Where did you meet Simon? Safeway. [MUSIC HERMAN'S HERMITS, "NO MILK TODAY"] You must like nuts. MAN: I do. Very much. "He turned his lips to hers and with his hand, called back the tangles of her wandering hair. Even then, their love they could not all command and half forgot their danger and despair." How much are you? [MUSIC HERMAN'S HERMITS, "NO MILK TODAY"] [alarm buzzing] I'll have to check your receipt. Oh, no. I've paid for him. I promise. Stand away. Just move back. [inaudible] the bar code. That's all. Just stand back. Away from the doors, please! We'll have to strip search you. [screaming] [alarm clock ringing] Morning. Morning. Morning. Morning. Morning. Yeah, morning! SHE (VOICEOVER): At any moment now, Francis will walk in and we won't even need to speak. We'll just look into each other's eyes with a deep hunger. And then we'll go into the back room and tear each other's clothes off, and claw at each other's skin, and-- and-- and then I won't know what to do. And he'll find out. And that will be it. The end. (FOREIGN ACCENT) Excuse me? Excuse me? Excuse me! What? (FOREIGN ACCENT) Uh-- uh-- Can I put in your window? Whatever. [jazz music playing] Why aren't there courses in this stuff? SHE (VOICEOVER): Unfortunately, every desperate woman in Melbourne had the same bright idea as me. OK! OK! OK! Ladies! Ladies, ladies, ladies! That's beautiful, huh? Now repeat after me. [speaking spanish] [speaking spanish]. OK. Now you get into to partnerships. And I am watching you, margarita! It's the one partner for you today, OK? All right. [interposing voices] OK. And repeat please. I'll be the man, if you like. Hola. (IN UNISON) Hola. Hola. (IN UNISON) Hola. JIMMY: Why don't you find someone you don't like? [mariachi music] Adios. Adios. Excuse me? Si? I think I need some help with my prepositions. Here. You can practice at home. Oh. Good. Excuse me? Hmm? Do you have any crash courses? Crash? What is this word? Crash? I need to learn fast. Very, very fast. [music playing] [speaking spanish]. Beside? No, no, no. Under. As in, underneath. [phone ringing] [speaking spanish]. On? As in, on top of. In? En. As in, inside of. In Costa Rica-- What? What was the last-- I am making your ear better. Yeah-- my ear? Oh. Would you like to come back to my house for some more practice? Si. Si, si. Antonio! [dog barking] Hola! Si, si, si. [speaking spanish] What's this for? In case you get amnesia? Amnesia? What is this word? Amn-- Never mind. Por que? Oh! Si. That's-- that's for my private students. To learn. Cafe? There are some very easy books for you to start reading. -Pablo, I-- -I can lend you some. These are very hard to find in Australia. No, no! Do you teach in your bedroom as well? Here. Have a look at this one. It's in both English and Espanol. He's-- how do you say in English? My namesake. "If only you would touch my heart. If only you would put your lips to my heart." "Your delicate [inaudible]. Your teeth, they [inaudible] your tongue like a red arrow where my beating heart is crumbling." "If you would blow over my heart, near the sea, crying, it would ring with an obscure sound. The sound of train wheels, of dreams. Like the to and fro of waters. Like autumn in leaf. Like blood." SHE (VOICEOVER): And then, just at the crucial moment, desire and purpose fizzled into nothing. And all I could see was a sweating, moaning, heaving, hairy Spaniard trying to hump me. [groaning] Pablo, I can't! Que? I just-- I like to get to know someone a bit better before I-- [groaning] No! [music playing] [groaning] [jazz music playing] She walks in beauty. Like the night of cloudless climes, and starry skies. And all that's best of dark and bright meet in her aspect and her eyes. MAN: [inaudible] bitch, baby! [screaming] [cheering] Maybe you were pressing too hard? Um. You see, it's a delicate thing. You've got to know exactly the right amount of pressure to exert. Where and when. It's like anything. It just takes a little bit of practice. Can I help you? CUSTOMER: Yeah, can I have a number four? Thanks. Yeah, right. JIMMY: So how was it apart from that? Great. Chili? Yeah. That's good. $3.20, thanks. Oh, great. [inaudible]. Yeah. So-- so what are you doing here then? CUSTOMER: Yeah, um-- Do you prefer to fuck or be fucked? Can I help you? That depends. CUSTOMER: Number one, thanks. Well, you're lucky. You've got some choice. So would you, if you stopped playing the victim. Sorry, did you say chili? I have got no choice. I've just got to lie there and let it all happen. Not all men like being dominant. Mustard? Yes, they do. All heterosexual sex is a violation by definition. French, English, Dijon? Enter, penetrate, invade! [crying] I don't know how to do it. OK. So if desire is all we've got, why the hell is it so difficult for you? Why can't you just get out there and root yourself stupid? Because. Because society has invented oppressive constructs to control desire. Oh, yeah. I forgot about those constructs. Like love. Love is an invention of capitalism. Right. OK. Could you, um, lead me through that one a little bit? Do you want to know? Yeah, well-- well, I'm fascinated. Please. [music from other room] Go on. Go on. Go on. All right. As soon as we started owning land, we needed heirs. So we need to married and monogamy. And women were brainwashed into believing these notions of true love so that they would remain faithful and continue the dynasty. It's a big lie. Yeah, it's a shocker. Mmm. So what interests me, therefore, is why you read all this brainwashing stuff, eh? What's Mister Wordsworth got to say about the big lie? OK. "Her household motions light and free. And steps of virgin liberty. A countenance which did meet sweet records, promises as sweet. A creature not too bright or good." That sounds a bit like-- no that's not how-- He's talking about a spirit. Not a real woman. Oh! Oh, OK. That's fine then. Anyway, you have to know your enemy. Yeah, I guess so. It's funny though. I just don't believe you. [music playing] SHE: Ow! Shit! [knocking on door] LACHLAN: How you going, sis? What do you want? OK. Now you've seen it. You can take your little friend and go to Time Zone. Hi. Happy birthday. Hi, my name's Lachlan and that's James. Hi. Would you like some coffee? Oh, thanks. White with two. Have you got any beer? SHE (VOICEOVER): Right. Forget about myself. Forget about my birthday. Just accept the way things are and get on with life. WOMAN: Excuse me? Hello? Would you mind if I put this up in your window? Yeah. Just leave it on the table and I'll put it up in sec. Great. Thanks. Oh, that is a fantastic book. Have you read it? No. Not yet. OK. Thanks. SHE (VOICEOVER): Forget about love and sex. And concentrate on-- on-- people with real needs! Just down to the [inaudible]. Good. Hello! I thought you might be interested. Well, it's important to use a privilege in a positive way. I could not agree with you more. Just over to the center of that table. Thanks. Oh, hi! [boxes crashing] How you going? You having fun? Yeah, great. I just thought I'd bring you over some pamphlets on the political situation in North Sangalia. Just so you know who you're doing all of this for. And even more importantly, why. I think it's important to be clued in, don't you? Absolutely. You know what I find amazing? Is that once you actually start helping other people, you actually realize, and without even knowing it really, you're helping yourself as well. SHE (VOICEOVER): She was so right. This was what was going to save me from loneliness and self obsession. And you know, whatever that thing is that you want so much to fill the hole inside you, you know it might not be what you think it is. Can I just tell you that I woke up one morning and realized-- SHE (VOICEOVER): What an amazing woman. So selfless, and passionate, and-- and beautiful. God, she's beautiful. I know that it can take a lot of courage to recognize that your obsession with your own problems-- well, it's actually a comfortable addiction. And that's why it is so important to challenge yourself, to transgress the boundaries. SHE (VOICEOVER): Transgress the boundaries. Transgress the boundaries. Transgress the boundaries. My god. I'm gay. I'm gay. I'm gay. And the world is full of women! Hey, you should come to our buy a cow for the women of Pakistan meetings. I'd love to. Really? It's a great way of promoting self sufficiency in communities. SHE (VOICEOVER): I can't do it with men because I'm not attracted to men. Sex between equals. Sex without oppression. Can you lose your virginity to a woman? Sorry, am I boring you? No. No, no, no. Actually, I was wondering if you'd like to go, and have a coffee somewhere, and just keep talking. OK. I'd love to. Excuse me? Great. Excuse me? You don't put the chicken trim soup marked with red text. They're for vegetarians. Sorry. That's my foster child from Tanzania. Bawindi. Chai? Thanks. Thanks. I'll just-- like so. Do you like children? Um, sure. That Bawindi, she is such a fabulous little girl. I think education is just so important for girls in developing countries because boys, so often, get the preferences for food-- SHE (VOICEOVER): Make a move, make a move, make a move! Uh, I love your shirt! Oh, thanks. And her English! My god, it gets better and better every single letter I get. It's improved. It makes me feel so proud. I'm so proud of her. I'm going to-- SHE (VOICEOVER): Maybe she just thinks I'm being friendly. Women always touch each other. Shit! Don't you think so? Do you like boot-scooting? [african music playing] "12 sisters are sad. They have no mom and dad. Bawindi has full tummy. She has lovely, Aussie mommy. Today we eat you." It's so sweet. I'm sorry. It's just sometimes-- I feel-- I'm so lonely. It's like I'm-- my whole body just aches to be touched. Almost like my skin is just going to break apart, if it doesn't happen. Oh, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. I know you really don't need this. It's OK. It must be terrible to be so-- What are you doing now? Now-- Right now, nothing. Let's go to a bar. OK. I need to sleep with someone tonight. So do I. You see, I'm ovulating. Yeah, proven by who? Freud? [groaning] Hey, guys, I was going to light another bong. I'm so [inaudible]. I'm so wasted. Why are birthdays so foul? JAYA: What would you know about Freud anyway? You've never read a book in your life! BLACKSON: Freud is a complete irrelevant. Because when you're a kid, the whole world stops for you on your birthday. When you're an adult, no one-- no one gives a shit. Do you mean that? Happy Birthday. I'm not wearing that! What? It's not really me. Who is you? I thought you were just a construct anyway. Oh, that's true. Hey, gorgeous. So are you coming to Three Faces? What for? So I can pick up a nice drag queen? Hey, that is a good look. You might be starting something. Did you hear that? Hey, shall we go? Yeah. You should go to bed. Hey! It's almost midnight. You can stop expecting anything! [MUSIC HERMAN'S HERMITS, "THERE'S A KIND OF HUSH"] [crashing] You awake? Hey! You awa-- Oh, shit! Sorry. Go to bed. I can't find Simon. He's not in here. I can't find Simon! Well, he's not in here! I need to find him. And I need to find Simon! Oh, shit, Jimmy! Simon. [phone ringing] WOMAN: Well, I'm sorry, but-- MAN: Oh, come on. Is this your street? WOMAN: Yes, it is actually. I live here. MAN: Have you got a car? Have you got a car? WOMAN: I've got a right to park my car. Yes, I do. And I have a right to park it in front of my house. Hello? It's for you! Got any more beer? [speaking russian]. I thought you said that you-- What? Ready? Ready. We went to a great restaurant the other night. What was it called? More potatoes? Great, big serves for only-- I don't think they're interested in that, Pat. Did I tell you I ran into Donny Hopkins? Danny. He's having to [inaudible]. Oh. Did you know Maria left for a wood turner she met in her adult education class? He wasn't a wood turner. He was a cabinet maker. -Wasn't he? He was a wood turner. No, he was a cabinet maker. Your mother's been watching them over the fence. No. Jamie, did I tell you? I've enrolled in French classes. You're doing very well, too. He's in charge of five men. Le gateau. [cat squealing] We're going on holiday to Koolaburra. Have you ever been there? Of course they haven't. Nobody's even heard of it. Actually, we were thinking of going there for our summer holidays. We should have a game of golf, son. I've got to meet Simon. Oh, I've got to meet someone. Thanks. [jazz music playing] This one has great articles. Yes. Yes, I used to subscribe to that one, but after a while, I found that I needed something a little less cerebral. Maybe you should try this one? MAN: Check this out, Simon! [laughing] Excuse me? Hey. Oh, no. No, no. Don't tell me. Another failed romance. You could say that. Do something for Christ's sake! Scream at me! I don't want to talk about it all right! Or hit something! Cry! I don't understand you. [laughing] You OK? Can't you leave them on? JIMMY: Why? Just because you can't handle a bit of cock? I'm a lesbian. Of course, I can. Ah, a lesbian. Right! And when did that little development occur? Eh? Eh? Don't! Come on! Come on in! Come on. Come on! I can do it. But you said you needed help. Not with my buttons. You don't know what you want, do you? What? You're just going to sit there like a little, middle class princess? Let everyone else do the hard work. I'll tell you something, Passivity isn't sexy. Well, it is, but only for about five minutes. [police sirens] Is that sexy? Oh, that's uh-- not bad. Come on! Hurry up! Come on! Get in! [singing] Get 'em off! [cheering] Now that is sexy! Hey! What? We're being watched. What? What? [laughing] There must be a charge for that, eh? You know what I think? What? I think you actually don't want to lose it. I mean, does it-- does it make you feel powerful, holding on to it or something? No. God, you've got the most beautiful neck. Can't you take a compliment? Relax, I'm not trying to seduce you. Did I hurt you? I'm not trying to seduce you. Should I have told you? Yeah. It's OK. Slow down! It's OK. I'm not the enemy. No! You're just using me to get your revenge on Simon! Why do you do that? Do what? Tell you the truth? You know what you are? You're a miserable, frigid bitch! Simon loves me. Simon loves me! You don't even know what the word means, do you? I don't know what the word means because it doesn't exist! I'm not blind, all right, Jimmy! I saw him! Bullshit! You-- you saw what you wanted to see because you want everyone to be like you, a pathetic, screwed up, victim! Simon would never do that to me! All right. Fine! You believe that! Believe the whole bloody lie and see where that gets you! I thought you were my friend. I am. That's why I told you! Yeah? Yeah, really? Yeah, well, maybe I didn't want to know! Yeah, well, maybe I'm not frigid! Maybe I just didn't want to be a charity fuck! [door closing] Shit. [music playing] JAYA: Inverts. They derive pleasure from intercourse with their own sex only when their normal sexual object is inaccessible. [inaudible] inverts. Psychosexual hermaphrodites. Sexual object make or [inaudible]. Do you think there are categories he never thought of? SHE (VOICEOVER): It was an aberration. That's all. A stupid, drunken aberration. He's gay, for Christ's sake. And so am I. I'm gay. I am. You have got the most beautiful neck. You have got the most beautiful-- Neck. I'm not trying to seduce you. [moaning] [alarm clock buzzing] I'm not gay. SHE (VOICEOVER): Holy Mary, mother of God, please don't make me be in love with a gay boy. All I want is to lose my virginity, so that I can spend the rest of my life with Francis. I'll do it with the next, nice, straight boy I meet. I promise. -Excuse me? Hi. You look like someone in need of love. What? I'm a member of Volleyballers for Christ. Oh. The Lord loves us faithfully and unconditionally. -Oh, God. -Oh, yes. Him, too. Josh? I've been a poet, albeit unpublished, for about a decade. Thank you all for coming. Um-- Flies buzz. Wind cries. Dust crawls. Clouds weep. Her singlet strains with the weight of her class. The weight of her sex. She's going to nowhere, this sunken feature, above the screech of Cockatoos. She cooks the party pies. He plays cards. The void wept for her plight as she tumbled to the floor. Plan post nothingness, he replied. [applause] Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you. And I saw this documentary where the couple only ever have sex if she initiates it. That's really interesting. Yeah, it is. It is. It really is. JIMMY: Passivity isn't sexy. Well, it is, but only for about five minutes. Um-- I was wondering if you might want to come back to my place and have a coffee? Sure. That'd be great. [music playing] Another cup? Where's the bedroom? Can you hang on a minute? [blowing nose] [spitting] Bollocks. Jesus. Shit. I think there might be something wrong with your pelvic structure. Oh, well, I've never had this problem before. [groaning] [crying] Oh! Hi. Hi. How are you? Good. Do you want some [inaudible]? Sorry? Muesli. Oh. Yes. Yum. I like to get up early and write. That's a good idea. Do you mind if I just get something down before breakfast? No. Not at all. Thanks. Can I be candid with you? Sure. I realized something about myself last night. Soy or dairy? Dairy. Thanks. It's funny, isn't it? You go through-- you go through live wanting and pining for something. And then we you actually get it, you realize that it's not what you really wanted after all. I really need to be in my own head at the moment. I have to find out what's in there before I try and work out what's in other peoples'. [coughing] You OK? Fine. Just a hazelnut. Anyway, what I realized is that I'm actually, uh-- not a-- well, I'm actually not a fundamentally-- Sexual person? How did you know? Just a stab in the dark, so to speak. [music playing] Francis, baby, here I come! [church bell ringing] What ward is Jimmy [inaudible] in? Um, I'll just check for you. He's in intensive, but you-- excuse me, you can't go-- [panting] [machine beeping] Excuse me. [crying] Sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Excuse me, you have to leave now. You're not allowed in here. Come on. MAN (ON TV): [inaudible] is having a three day furniture frenzy. This Friday, Saturday, and Sunday, we must clear one million dollars worth of stock!
