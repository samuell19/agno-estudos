Hello, Dr. Wade's office. Can I help you? Midwestern Phone Company. Hello? Yeah, look, I have a, I have a notice that my phone's gonna be shot off. Yeah, uh, I'd like to make an appointment with Dr. Wade, I guess. What is the customer ID number? Have you been here before? Um, uh, there's nothing here. Um, no, not really. Okay, I found it, I found it. A77- - Not really? 462396. Hello? Can you hear that? I can hear you, no problem. Yeah, your phone is being shut off today. No, no, can you hear, can you hear that? Listen. Why? Why is it being shut off today? No, I don't hear anything. Uh, perhaps you didn't pay the bill. That's weird. Uh, okay, is it possible that I, and I pay my bills, by the way, ma'am, thanks. Can I have an extension? When did you wanna come in? I just need a little more time. I guess sometime next week would be fine. I'm going to put you on hold. I guess sometime next week would be find. All right. Fine. Let me see what we have available. Can you hold please? Sure. Unfortunately, they are already scheduled to come out and shut it off. Thank you for holding- - Can I give them a partial check when he gets here? How about Monday at 9:30 a.m.? Can I give 'em a partial check when he gets here? Can I do that? You can certainly ask them, sir, It's up to their discretion at this point. Or I have- - However, according to our records, you already bounced the last two checks, though. That's not gonna work. Actually, Monday at 9:30 is the best. Yeah, thanks. Yeah, thank you ma'am, for pointing that out. What time are they gonna be here? I don't think I can make Monday, so maybe I'll just- - Sir, I really have no idea, but- - I'm just gonna call you, call you back. Hello? - Okay, are you sure? - Hello? No ma'am, not you, thank you. I hear someone else talking. I'm happy to check another date the following week. There's only me, sir. Thanks, I'm sure. Anything else I can help you out with? No, thanks. Okay- - You have a day filled with joy, sir. Actually, could you check one more thing? I... - Hello? Hello? Hello? Hello? Uh, I think our phone lines might have got crossed. Yeah, I, uh, I think you might be right. I've thought I heard someone else talking. Yeah, I, I think I heard you as well. Huh. Yeah, this happened before. That was, was weird. I was having a conversation and then it turned out to be someone I knew a few, few blocks away. Huh. Apparently Chicago's having some issues. Wait, you're in Chicago? Yeah. That's really strange. Why? What do you mean? Well, I'm in Michigan. You're in Michigan? Yeah. Wow. How'd that happen? I have no idea. Oh, that's weird. Yeah. Well, I'm sorry about the, um, the crossed phone lines. Yeah, that's, that's okay. It's not your fault, and I'm sorry about that as well. Okay. Okay. Yeah, you know. What are you, wait, okay, so what is it, like a cottage? No, it's, it's this very old, Victorian house that definitely sticks out from the other houses around here. But I guess that's- - How old are we talking here? Like it's, you guys are Michigan royalty? - No, no, but my, my grandparents, my great-grandparents actually owned it. So we've been here, and you know, parked outside this obscure house is this beat-up Volkswagen Bug, which is sacrilegious around here. Oh, no. - And yeah, and, and so my sister and I, we just were indoors playing music every day, and you know, that's not the typical thing to do. Every day? - Yeah, I know, every day. That's, I mean, it's dedication. - Yeah. You guys, do you still play? - Uh, no. Actually, she, she passed away not too long ago. Oh, sorry to hear about that. Fuck. No, no, it's, you know, it's, it's life. It's, it's fine. But, you know, death sucks. But I'm still just a Michigan girl, even though I don't own a Ford. I don't think you have to. I don't think you should have to. Anyway, you know, it's, it's funny, there were these train tracks outside of our house when we're growing up, and I'd stand outside and just like wait for the train to pass by so I could jump on it and take it like a mile away to the candy store. Well, how old were you when you were doing this? Oh, I don't know. I was like 12. Like, a mature 12. So I don't know if that makes it better or worse. Yeah, I don't, uh Anyway, after the candy store, I would wait for another one to come back so I could head home, you know? But one time I fell asleep and I ended up 30 miles away. How did you get back home? Uh, I didn't, I'm still here. I'm kidding. But my, anyway, my parents weren't amused, but I always told myself I'd never own a car, 'cause you know, I was a train guy. I like that. And do you still live in the same area? - No, no, I don't live there anymore. But the block I lived on was rad. Hanging out with all the neighborhood kids, playing 'til it got dark. I liked it, you know. It was, it was cool. Everything was in its place, if that makes sense. Anyway, we ended up moving to, to like the good ol' United States of Texas. I don't know if you've been to Texas, but I couldn't find my identity. I mean, you know, one day I'm standing there in like penny loafers and khakis, and then Izod, and then another day I'm in boots and Wranglers and a flannel shirt, and I, you know, I just couldn't, I, I couldn't figure it out. Yeah. - I mean, maybe all teenagers feel that way to some degree, but it feels like it was more so for me, like, it kinda set me on the path to feeling like an outsider, you know? I mean, I always thought things would be different when I graduated, or when I got to a certain age, but it turns out we are who we are no matter what birthday we just had. - That's either really depressing or really reassuring, and I'm not sure which. Both, maybe, I don't know. - But yeah, I, I get your passion for music. So yeah, anyway, I came back home to Chicago. I guess the question is, is everything gonna work up? What are you watching? Uh, I dunno. I'm not really watching it, but I guess it's "Oprah." Let me ask you this, Bob. - Everybody's trying to be Phil Donahue, I guess. Yeah. We hear so much now in the 80's about New Age thought- - Do you know where Youngstown, ME is? Uh, I don't know. Maine? - Or maybe it's MD. That's Maryland, right? Could be a Madagascar. Madagascar. It took a long way to get to me. Can you hang on a sec? Uh-huh. - Hello? Hey, what you doing? There's this campsite called Bowling Springs. Yeah? - And uh, we would go there and we would visit my uncle, which turned out to be my mom's friend, which technically I think is my father. Anyway, we would go there and we'd all sit around a campfire and roast marshmallows, and the people from the neighboring campers would come and bring out their instruments: guitars, tambourines. And I remember sitting on his lap, and it's actually my first memory of playing the guitar. He would hold the frets, and I would strum the strings, and he'd always tell me to do the backup vocals. And he'd always get in trouble from my mom because he always had a cigarette dangling out of his mouth. - Wait, wait, sorry to interrupt. I gotta go back to this one point. What do you mean you think your uncle, who's really your mom's friend, is technically your father? - Well, it's kind of a long story. Huh. Should I not ask? - Um... Sorry, I was just curious. - No, it's, it's, it's okay. I um, I'm just not sure I really know who he is. Oh, can you ask your mother? Hang on one sec. Someone's knocking. Sure. - All right, hang on, damn it. I gotta switch phones. Are you there? Hello? All right, I'm, I'm coming. Gimme a second. Hey, you still there? I can't hear you. Yeah, I'm still here. - I thought I lost you. All right, I'm coming. Do I know you? Yeah, the phone company. - Ah, shit. - Okay, just play along, all right? Okay. I'm the DJ and you're the, you're the caller, okay? - What do I do? Don't worry about it; you'll see. All right. - And 4, 3, 2, 1. This is KSOL 810 AM Soul Jam, and I'm your Soul Man. We have a request from the great state of Michigan. Are you still there, Michigan? - Yes. I'm still here, Soul Man. Oh my God, that was horrible. - Your voice is as sexy as Jackie Brown, baby. Thank you. All right. So what, what soul song is it you wanna hear, baby? - Um, I don't know. Take your time. We're just live on the air. - Okay, um, it has to be Aretha Franklin. Let's do "Natural Woman." - Aretha Franklin, the Queen of Soul. Let me see if I can find that. In the meantime, here's Chicago's own.

So here to there. Ah, I win. Whoa, way to go! Way to go. Way to go. Column one to column one, your bucket. - Column four, baby! Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo! I won. - So, you got a boyfriend? You datin' anybody? - Uh, I have met a few boys in my time, but um, I guess we'll just leave it at that. What about you? - Never had a boyfriend, no. - Dating girls, I mean. - I've, I've had a couple of beautifully forgettable dates, and one great one. - I think dating has a way of misrepresenting itself. It's like cussing: overrated unless used fucking appropriately. One great one, huh? - Yeah, at the ripe old age of 11. My, my insatiable soon-to-be first girlfriend, Lily Adley, who happened to be the biggest Beatles fan I knew, quite possibly the only one, decided we were gonna be the Sergeant Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band for Halloween. - Sounds like a girl I'd like. - I mean, Lily's first idea was she wanted me to be Houdini to make everybody disappear. She said that'd be impressive. And I agreed. But as much as I wanted to impress her, there were a, you know, couple of obstacles that I just couldn't overcome, unfortunately. Yeah, only a couple. - Anyway, there was only three of us. It was me, Lily, and my best friend Benny the Bird. Benny the bird? Why do you guys call him Benny the Bird? Feathers growing out of him? - Oh no, he only had two fingers, and it was one middle finger on each hand. So that's why we call him the bird. And I heard that his dad was in the mafia, Big Benny, right? And outta retaliation, they cut off little Benny's fingers. Oh my God. - So, yeah, he'd always be saying "F you" to his old man. That's awful. - Yeah. Well, retaliation for what? - Well, word is, he wore too much cologne to a poker game. That's all I know. Is he really in the mafia? - Eh, I doubt it. But you know, I heard his dad owns a construction company, and I think Benny was just born with a hand defect, if I'm honest. So, yeah. Anyway, we used his mom's cocker spaniel to be Ringo. And this may not be the best time to mention this, but I'm pretty sure Ringo had chlamydia, so... That's gross. - Karma. - So um, I met John Lennon Oh. Well, what a way to trump my story. - I'm sorry. No, it's okay. When you're done, I'll just tell you about the time that I met God. - No, I-I feel really bad. I'm kidding. - I, I know you didn't meet God. I just... That's not what I was kidding about. But anyway, tell me the story. - Did you know that, that, that John called Yoko Mother? How would I know that? I only played him for Halloween. - Good point. All right, so what happened? - Well, my um, my mom, she knew this girl Lorianne, and we went to her private party. My mom introduced us to everybody. And when she introduced me to John, inside, I was, I was just, whoa, that's, that's John Lennon. Anyway, my mom told everyone we were musicians and we ended up singing a song. What, like acapella? - Um, well, we could have, but, we um, we actually did a song that we, that we wrote. It was, um, it was called "First House on East Ninth." Not that that matters, but it was this unique kind of folky song we were working on at the time. Anyway, we did this song, and, and at the end of it, there was just this long pause, you know, no clapping. Everyone was just kind of, just kind of staring at us, and we were staring back at them. And then John, he turns to Yoko and says, "Mother, I think we found an extension of our love." - That's cool. It was a little surreal. It was just one of those moments where you know that you're exactly where you're meant to be in the world. - Wow. - And it's just some euphoric feeling that makes you feel as if everything is gonna be cool. I assume it probably felt like home more than any actual home, in a way. At home in your soul, maybe? And you guys ever record that song? - No. Why? - We um, we, we just didn't. You like to write, huh? - Yeah, I like doing creative things, you know. I always said I wanna be a creator or nothing at all. What do you mean creator? - You know, like, like a creator. You know, a creator of, of, of film, of words, of, of music, characters, a creator. But yeah, I like to write, I like to paint. I wanted to be an actor and a filmmaker when I was young. You don't anymore? - No, I, I still do. I made my first film when I was 13. That's cool. What was it about? - It was called "The Ghost in the Invisible Sheet." And it was a movie about a documentary, except the documentary was fake. So it was a fake documentary movie about a documentary that never happened. Ah, I don't get it. - Yeah. Nobody else did either. Well, did you make any more movies? - Uh, no. Well, you should. I think that movies can tell us more about how to live our lives than the real world does, don't you think? - Yeah. So uh, what do you look like? A girl. - Well, yeah, but you know, we've been talking for a while now, and I got this image of you, and I'm just kind of curious what you look like. - You know, it's, it's funny. I created an idea of you in my head, and I must have convinced myself that that's what you actually look like because I haven't thought about it again. This could go horribly wrong. - No, it's, it's nothing bad. It's just kinda strange in a way. Strange? - I see your face, but I don't, I don't see your face. You know what I mean? No. So what is the face that you see? - I, I don't wanna say. Is that okay? I just, I just wanna listen to your voice. Makes me, I don't know, makes me feel safe. Of course it's okay. So tell me something about you. - Maybe I don't know what I'm talking about. Who knows? I don't have it all together, you know. Sometimes happy is a mask that I wear. And no one really knows me, how close I am to not being here anymore. - What do you mean? - I had this relative, his name was Hank. And every time he saw me, he'd hug me. He'd sit me on his lap and he'd tell me that he loved me. And then he'd say that my worth was determined by the amount of money I make. He was always saying, "Stupid people take stupid jobs and end up making stupid decisions." And then he'd whisper in my ear, "You're not stupid, are you?" And I never answered him. And I think, I think part of me realized that I never answered his question, because in that moment, I knew I was stupid. You know, it took me a while, but eventually I figured out what was going on. It wasn't hard to see it in his satin-stained alcohol eyes. And when I finally realized what he was doing when he came to my room, it was too late. And then a couple years ago, my agent calls me and says, "You got an audition." And I booked my first acting job. It was an industrial. What's an industrial? - It's an internal thing for, you know, a company. They only show to their employees. But it was my last acting job. I'm gonna tell you the truth. It was the doubts that complicated my mind. You know, I was, I was, I was broke mentally, I was broke financially, and uh, and I knew the one person that could help was one person that I hated to ask. I asked Hank for a job at his brokerage company. And I remember when he saw me, he whispered in my ear, "So you finally stopped being stupid." I just, I, I couldn't, I couldn't do it. I couldn't stand to look at his face. You know, I figured, I figured I'd rather die broke and pursuing my dreams than, than selling my soul to that fucking pig, you know? You know what I mean? I don't know. Somehow, whenever I'm left to my own devices, I-I-I seem to have a way of fucking everything up, royally. But it's, it's the, it's the doubts that keep tying the noose around my neck. You know, I, I feel like I'm, I'm standing in a, in a boat of mediocrity and I'm looking for the oar because somehow I've become psychologically crippled, you know? I wish I could help you in some way. - I gotta help myself first, you know? I know. - The funny thing is, Local church is doing a missionary trip to Africa for a year. Are you going? - I was planning on it. I haven't packed any boxes yet, but supposed to leave on Monday. This Monday? Yeah. I just want it to be a fresh start, you know? I hope that made sense. On the, on the path from my brain to my mouth, things get jumbled up somehow, and I'm, I'm never as eloquent as I wanna be. That's another source of frustration. You okay? Yeah. You sure? Mm-hm. Do I need to let you go? - No. Your story, it just, it just made me think. What'ch you thinking about? - I wanna tell you something, and I've never said it out loud before. You can tell me anything. - Um, when we were about three or four, my sister and I realized that of all the callings in the world, we were destined to do was music. Last year we were, we were headed to a music festival. And I got an argument with my sister about who was gonna drive. And, and so I took the keys and I, and I got in the car. And my mother, she had to sit in the front because my sister didn't even wanna sit next to me. She um, she just sat in the back and this was the first time that she never, she's never said anything to me. It was just a mile away. And, and I lost control of the car. And it just started to slide, and it felt like, I felt like it was hydroplaning. And I, and I couldn't get control of it. And I crashed into a telephone pole. And it split in half. And, and I remember that there was nothing in front of me. It was just me in the seat of the car in the middle of the road. And, and, and I couldn't find them. And I, and I started calling out for them. And I didn't know where they were. And I And I found my sister. And it was horrible. I knew, I knew she would be dead. And I finally found my mom. She was, she was down this embankment. And I was trying to talk to her, but she was just staring at me. I'm here. Just breathe. I wish I could do something. - I'm sorry. Oh, no, it's okay. What can I do? - And I just feel like, I just feel like all this life is going on around me and, and it's not for me. I'm not really here. I-I don't exist. I'm just, I'm just in this purgatory. I don't know. I'm here. Just breathe. Just breathe. - I haven't played any music since the accident. I never sang. It just feels wrong without her.

I want you to sit in the chair. - Oh. Okay. Okay. Now what? - Okay. So this is the idea that I thought of when I was thinking of the idea that I couldn't make work. You can probably open your eyes now, by the way. - Okay. - I want you to reach under the chair. - Under the chair. - Grab the book. - Okay, book grabbed. - All right. There's some colored pencils there, too, but I think you can just leave them there for now. Okay. What we're gonna do is we're gonna take turns describing what we look like, and then the other person is gonna try their best to create a drawing based on that description. All right? And then we're gonna use the colored pencils, as well. - I dig it. - All right. - Wait, wait, wait. That's not fair though. You're an artist. - Yeah, but I'm a, I'm a can't-draw-people kinda artist. - That's okay. I got, I got some artist skills up my sleeve. Oh, I, I, dropped- - You all right? - Yeah, I dropped the book. - All right. - Okay. - Remember, the goal is to really try and draw the best composite possible, okay?

Okay, I got paper. - Damn it. - Okay, I go first. - You go first. - Okay, I am, I'm going to draw you first. - Okay, perfect. - So, what color should I start with? I guess your skin color, right? What's your skin color? - Yeah, I got like pinky yellow. - Pinky yellow? - Yeah, use both if you like in this one. Dual pencil. - Dual wielding, okay. - Okay, this'll be maybe a bit abstract. - That's fine. - Okay. Pink and yellow, okay. What color hair? - Uh, you know, I guess it's like a dirt- - I'm pulling black. - No, it's not black. Oh, it's like a, like a mousey brownie, dirty blonde kind of mix. I don't know how you're gonna- - Mousey, brown, dirty, okay. - Short sides, short back, and then long on the top, kind of- - How long on top? - Uh, like, it's, it's deceivingly long. Like, it's kinda wavy, so it's gotta, it shortens itself. - So kinda, kinda Elvis-y. Kind of a pompadour-type thing? - Oh, I hope not. I mean, maybe a little bit. No, it's just kind of uh, just a little whip. - Like a whoof. - Little whip. You know what I mean? - Hhhwhip. - Yeah. - Okay, eye color? - Brown. - Brown. - That one's less confusing. - Just straight brown. - Yeah. - Little bit of yellow, no? - If you like. I'm not feeling sick today, but this is your drawing. I've got, like, my nose is kind of like sharp, like a triangle kind of thing. - Which upside down triangle? Do you have long eyelashes? That's changing the subject. - I guess so. Like, you could see 'em, yeah. - Okay, do you have eyebrows? - Yeah, I got bushy eyebrows. - Bushy eyebrows, black? Brown? Same color as your hair. - Yeah, exactly. - Okay. - All right, how's it going? - You look, you look top-rung handsome right now. - Okay, perfect. - What, what are you wearing? What are you wearing? - What am I wearing? I'm wearing a denimy kind of shirt. - Denimy kind of shirt. Blue? - It looks like a black. Just do the black, like, it's like a blue-gray. Everything's kind of blue-gray. And then the pants, kind of a black-red. - How are your fingers? I saw your fingers. They're slender. - Yeah, I got 10 fingers, by the way, just in case. I meant five fingers on one hand. - Of course. - Yeah, 1, 2, 3. - Not like Benny the Bird. - Almost there. Coloring your pants. - Nice. - Two feet, yes? Oh. - Two of 'em. - Two feet. Socks. All right, what size shoe? Because I can really- - I'm gonna be impressed if you scale it right. I think I'm a, I guess I'm a nine. - A nine. - Yeah. - Okay. - I wanna do mine now. When's it my turn? - Okay, okay, you are complete. - I'm complete? - Very handsome. - Now that you're here. Okay. - Aw, I like that. All right. - It's my turn. - Okay. - Don't show me. We're gonna show 'em together. - Okay. - Ready? - What do you wanna know? - Uh, you, you got a wide face? You got a narrow face? - Oh, face. Um, normal. Average. - Normal, okay. - Average. - Okay, what color is your hair? - It's, what do you think? - I think you're blonde. - Yes, but why do you assume that? - Nothin', nothin'. Why do you assume that? - No reason. I'm just gonna go ahead and draw the blonde hair. Have to do gold. Okay, what- - It's like, it's kinda dark blonde. - What kind of eyes you got? - They're, they, they're change. They change. - They change? - Well, it depends on what I'm wearing. When I'm wearing blue, they're more blue. If I'm wearing purple, they're green. - I'm just not gonna draw eyes, okay? - No, they're- - What kind of nose? - You could draw 'em like- - You got a sharp nose? You got a wide nose? - Um, it goes thin, I think, and then like- - Starts thin and then gets wide? - It's not usually- - Like a balloon? - Like a balloon, I don't know. - Okay. You're a clown at the moment, I hope you, I hope you know. It's a button nose. This is already ruined. You got lipstick on? You got red lips? What's going on? - I don't, I don't wear a lipstick. - Okay, it's too late. I use red already. - They're naturally tinted. - Okay. - I'm wearing a blue, long-sleeved dress. - Thank you for picking up, yeah, I'm not getting these colors right. Okay, so you get blue, long-sleeved- - With shells on it. The shells are black. - That's right. - So, so draw black shells on a blue dress. - Okay. - I think you'll like my socks. - What kind of socks you got? - I did get them in the men's section because- - You got man feet. All right. I'm gonna draw some man feet. - No, I don't have- - Big old man feet. For when you're hunting your animals that you make your clothes out of. - I don't have big feet. - Stepping on shells. - The men's section just has the coolest socks. They have rainbow sprinkles, which is my favorite donut, by the way. - All right, rainbow sprinkle socks. Rain. - See what I can do. It's not gonna work. Big old man feet. - With a pink band on top, and a blue band on the bottom. - Okay. - I also have long fingers. - I think the scale's too small. I'm not gonna nail those, but I'm just gonna draw big old witchy fingers. All right. This is so awful. I'm ashamed. I wish I'd never told you I was an artist, but I guess I'm ready to show it to you. - Ready? - Yeah. - Okay. - Do we just, uh, do we just pass 'em back? - Yeah. Over the top? - Over the top, but which way? Where you going? Is that your book? Is that your hand? All right, thank you. There's, there's yours. - Okay, thank you. - Okay. Oh my God! Oh! - I don't even know how to describe it. - You wanna open your eyes? - Yes. And no. Not now. I don't know. Do you? - I don't know. - Hi. - Hi. - I don't know how you'd do it. I think I'd choke. - It's just a classier way to commit suicide. - That is awful. Room service. - Food's here. - I gotta pee. Oh! All right. - You all right? - Yeah. - All right. Coming. - Good afternoon, sir. Your meat and cheese plate, set of fruits, champagne, two glasses, and a cookie. Compliments of the house, I presume. - Thank you. Compliments to the house. Wait, could you put it over there? - I could probably do that. - Okay, its ready. - How close am I? - I don't know, I can't see. - That was a test. How close is my voice? - Ah, it's close. - Can you guide me? - Okay, um, Marco. - Polo. - Marco. - Polo. - Marco. - Polo. - Um, I can kinda hear you. Let me try something else. Come to the sound of my hum, okay? - Ah. - I'm reaching out. I can, I can feel you. - You can feel me? I can feel your energy. Come here. - Oh, that's sweet. That's very sweet. Ah, I got you. - Okay. All right, all right. No, that's my head. Keep going backwards, backwards, backwards. This is your own fault. All right. - What do we got here. - Bon appetit, I guess. That room service guy was a total dick jerk, by the way. - Oh, yes. I, I heard him. - You heard him? - I heard him. "Good evening, sir. "I hate my fucking job. "Here is your meat and cheese plate, and your cookie." Don't choke on it. - That's not a bad English accent. I think it's better than his, actually. He's probably from Hedaho. Hedaho? - Do you get it? - What's Eedaho? Why are you laughing if you didn't get it? It's a, it's a pity laugh. - It's a funny word. I was trying, I was trying to be like, instead of Idaho, it's Hedaho. We're gonna move on because it didn't work, okay? Forget about it. - Okay. He was a vogansee; fugget about it. - Ah, fugget about it! Fugget about it! - I'm gonna, I'm gonna make in am offer he can't refuse. Oh shit. - Sorry, I'll just get that. - Your generosity is commendable, sir. Fugget about it. - Oh, it's my tooth. Go again. You're on the right place. - Okay, this is going in. No? - No. - Damn it.

That counts. That counts. - Yes! - Okay. - Okay. - You want a champagne spritzer? - Yes! Celebration! - I think you deserve a champagne spritzer- - And more grapes. - Okay.

But, but, and I, and I-I-I get it. Part of me, I-I-I wanna look at you. I wanna see you. But part of me, I don't.

I don't wanna see you, but a part of me does. - Yeah. It's overwhelming, this emotion. I don't know what it is. If it's love. Whatever I'm feeling, I'm feeling something. It's better than what most people have got in this world. So honestly, I can't explain it. I've got no clue. But if you don't wanna continue, I get it.

But every time I eat 'em, she'd remind me it causes high cholesterol. So now I hate that word, too. Oh no. - But then I got wrapped up in words that I thought were cool. So for instance, however I die, whatever it is, all I want my tombstone to read is, "We think he died of tuberculosis." Tuberculosis? - Love that word. - You know what your tombstone is gonna say? It's gonna say, "We think he..." - Spit it out. - "We think he died of tuberculosis, but it was most likely of high cholesterol." - Got a few things in common with my mother, I think. - Oh, I think they're, they're here. - Who's here?

And this one I've been really thinking about is about Ben Spencer. Have you ever heard of him? No, I don't think so. Boy, he's in Texas, so I thought maybe you might have, but, so he was given a 35-year sentence for murder. And when that case was overturned because a witness lied, they gave him the opportunity to take a plea deal, but he refused to take it, and stuck with his truth that he didn't do it. And now he's in there for life. And it's just something that haunts me. And, and I always think about, you know, if I would tell this lie to set me free or, you know, have my truth keep me locked up for, what, eternity. Well, did you figure it out? Yeah, I-I-I think I would, I would fight for my truth. I, I would stand by that. And every moment I was in there, I would find some way to, to show that light, to show the truth. I would have to. What about you? I never really thought about it, but maybe I'd like, maybe I'd like to get out, have a life. Yeah, it's, it's hard. And I, I just wish I could, I could change it for him, for anybody stuck like that.
