The universe is so large, humans so small. How should a man live his life? China, the Middle Kingdom, my home country where my dreams drift between aches and tenderness. My dear children, time has blurred my memories, but the scents, colors, sounds linger... Ah... and my third older brother... In our ancestral hometown, our family owned a bank. We were in business for over a hundred years. The transfer fee is 75 taels. This is your check for 5,000 taels to be cashed in Japan with three days' clearance. Please keep it safe. A good merchant is righteous. Your great-grandfather Lord Kang was a member of a powerful guild of bankers. He had four sons. All of them were much older than me. His third son was his least favorite. Third Master! Outside of our family estate was the other China. Thank you! First Master can't hear you. Move on! Dusty, poor... It was a time when... the hardships of life stole people's dignity. Big Brother. Second Master. Death to the Kangs! Let's go. Second Master, they're here again! Silver! Death to the Kangs! What use is porridge? Here are your coffins! Help, First Master. Silver! Death to the Kang! Lord Kang's eldest two sons had different approaches to this world. First Master, a Buddhist born deaf-mute, was a man of charity. Second Master, a man of action, settled things with his fists and feet. Lord Kang's fourth son found in his arranged marriage a bride he instantly fell in love with. They honeymooned in the seaport city of Tianjin. Their trip brought unforeseen changes to our family. Tianjin, 1899 Boxer Rebels were gathering strength for their war against Western churches. I will never do it again... That day, an ordinary day before the New Year Master Kang punished his most valuable manager, Manager Qiu, in front of his colleagues in the Guild. This Qiu bastard. Now we're loan sharks. Manager Qiu has certainly disgraced us. Loan sharks! Maybe our guidelines were unclear. He is my bank's failure, nothing to do with the Guild. Manager Qiu, you stepped over the line, breaching our principle of righteousness. You have no place in banking. You are dismissed. Go back to farming, learn to behave honorably. I'm finished... Gentlemen, my manager misbehaved. As penalty, I'll pay for 3 days of theater. You'll receive the invitations soon. We have always supported each other to ensure our reputation. Our muddled guidelines ruined a man. Muddled guidelines... We should all line up, pull down our pants and have our asses whipped! You first! You first! Third Master, we arrived. It's New Year's time, please spare some food... Get lost! Are you gone? There is too much sadness in this world, don't stay here to humiliate yourself. Thanks, Master. That day, our bank was to announce the bonuses. All the branch managers returned from their posts. "Humility and reposefulness." He headed the Beijing branch. Manager Dai! Third Master! Easier said than done. We ought to know better. I'm always away, no chance to supervise him. What's that smell? This is called "King of Fruits". South East Asians pawn their pants to eat this! I took the boat, rode a donkey to bring it here. Pick it up! In memory of our ancestors, in honor of Heaven and Earth, to honesty, good faith, and righteousness under the heavens. The grand total of fund transfers, savings and loans is 26,153,111 taels, verified without error. Our turnover amounts to one-tenth of the Court's annual income. It is accomplished by you and all the managers. Please accept my family's gratitude. My fourth son took his bride to the seashore in Tianjin. The lovebirds are getting on extremely well! - Manager Liu, did he trouble you? - Not at all. Where's Third? Never mind. Owner holding: 21 shares. Staff holding: 17 shares. Each share averages 15,816.5 taels. The highest bonus goes to... main branch, Manager Qiu. Although he is dismissed, his bonus of this term is awarded in full. Second goes to Beijing Manager Dai Ying. Drinks on me tonight! No one goes home sober! Tianjin Manager Liu... I get 0.7 shares. You do the math! Party at his place, but the drinks are on me! Bring in all our managers' sons! Ready! Third Master. Mother. Mrs. Landdeck, the Congregation Church. Mrs. Landdeck. Third Master Kang. Third Master... Madame Kang was a mystery. My family members never mentioned her. When servants talked about her they whispered. But she played a key role in our family history. Tell me about the porridge. Lord Kang's ancester was a poor camel boy whose master abandoned him in the Gobi Desert. The boy saved the life of a stranger. He gave a starving man his last bowl of porridge. The stranger left quietly in the night, giving him 30 pieces of silver, which the family considered a loan. That loan is worth millions today. Did your husband tell you this story? A boy told it to me when I was young. I drew this little book ten years ago. I was eight. I loved the story. Do you like it? Tianjin Move! Follow them! Follow them! Turn! Change! Hurry up! Catch up! Walk into the crowd! Sweetheart, did you see what I saw... Who stopped my palanquin? Go! Where's my wife? Where's Fourth Mistress? Urgent telegram! Urgent telegram! Last month we lent the army 50,000 taels. They'll help find Fourth Mistress. The gangs, the churches, the Boxers... We didn't offend any of them. Manager Liu, then it's a family matter, I won't bother you. I'm fully responsible. I'll go back to find her. I'll go with Manager Liu. Beg bodyguard companies for help. This is a kidnap. Keep it quiet, don't affect our bank. Third, we'll go help. Second! I'll arrange for bodyguards. You cannot go! Our own blood, rescued by others? Blood ties overtake judgment. Let the handlers do it. We don't risk our own blood. Deaf-mute, go to your room. Useless man! Third, we leave for Tianjin now. We're all useless... Our ancestors won wars for us, handlers take care of the rest. Our job is to learn how to live. Let's go have a drink. She is family. You spineless good-for-nothing! This isn't right. You've led me the wrong way. We ought to be going South but we're heading West. You've set me up! Second Master, please! Old Master wants to stop you... Go! Second Master! - Are you all right? - Don't touch him! Old Master. Father, I really... Second... No need to say anything. Go rescue Fourth's wife. You can't move, so don't try to. Tianjin Branch Help me! Fourth Master, it's me, Dai! There's a letter! A letter! Get out! "Considering our past relationship, "please go to the riverbank to receive Fourth Mistress Kang." "Past relationship"? Go there with bodyguards. I'll stay here... Just in case. A prostitute in love with a bank manager. What could I have wished for? They said eating opium is the most painful way to die. Do you think this punishment is harsh enough for you, dear? What will your bank do to you when they find out about us? You came after all. You did it. I did it. I knew you'd come back after you read my letter. Now that I've seen you again, I'll die in peace. Whore! You want to destroy me! We found something! Over here! You shouldn't have left me, however harshly the bank would punish you. Didn't you say: "If we die, we die together"? I took Fourth Mistress hostage to force you to come back. But the low-lifes I hired raped her, she killed herself. Fourth Mistress is dead. I'm sorry. You destroyed me... and I destroyed you. You hate me now. Stab me. I'll kill you! I will kill you! Branch managers cannot bring their families, cannot go to brothels or keep mistresses! These are the iron rules of the Guild! Your people have some nerve! 50 Liu killed his woman? So he hung himself? He has already rocked my family to the core. Now he tells the world that my foundation is rotten. Fourth Master... What about Fourth? Fourth Master... has had a mental breakdown. Fourth... From now on, I handle discipline and personnel. You take care of operations. Chairmen have to stay out of management, now I broke that rule. Yes. I thought four sons would be enough. Third! You're the only able-bodied man left. Go to Tianjin to bring your brother back. Don't push! Stand back! You'll get your money! There's plenty of silver. Other banks have offered to bail us out. If other banks help stop a run on our bank, our name will be ruined. I've written to my staff. Maybe my Beijing branch can help. Go see if there's a telegram from Beijing. I'm your brother! Fourth! I'm your brother. Look at me! I'm your brother. I know you mourn for her. We want our silver! Give us a bit more time. Don't let them see us. Quick! You mentioned a package? If Third Master could possibly... Manager Liu made a mistake, but his family is innocent. He had a mother, a wife and a son. If our rules didn't force change on human nature, only allowing managers to see their wives every three years... How many men can stand that? I'll take it to his family. Thank you for understanding. Manager Dai, I have heard of your great skills, but this problem came from within. How should we resolve it? Crises test our guts and smarts. All right. Your burden is great. Please take care. You also. Take care. What have I done to deserve this? What are my ancestors trying to tell me? Time to close the doors, draw the curtains! To keep up with the times, I hired you an English tutor. Ambassador Du's daughter. Her knowledge commands respect, so behave yourselves. No monkey business! I'll be next door. Take it away. Master hasn't come over for months. He must need you now, Madame... Take it away. Yes. Master... I carved a book seal for you. Put it there. Have you heard about Second and Fourth? Suddenly we're left with only one heir. It's been along time... Yet you're still so stubborn. When will you grow up? Bring me the scissors! Get out! Being Western-born doesn't entitle you to this. You can refuse me, but not my ancestors. All these years I let you be! Now with one heir left, you still spit on your duty? I'll be coming everyday. I won't give up until I have a son. Believe me, I'm wilder than you are. Tell the boss the silver's here! Beijing Branch of Tian Cheng Yuan Bank: 60 cases of silver delivered! Manager Dai. - Let's go have tea. - Our treat. Tianjin has been unsafe. We had no choice but to mislead our clients. River rocks in place of silver helped us out this time. No one compares to us when turning a crisis around. A crisis calls attention. Solving it smartly builds our reputation. Now that Tianjin city knows who we are, it's up to you to build upon it. Good luck! You have great foresight, Sir. The price of salt has doubled again. Keep it from the Government or we'll be in trouble. We'll sell when each kilo is worth a tael. Yes, Sir! Third Master! Get up, Son, we'll go visit Manager Qiu. Manager Qiu, I'm here to bring you back. I've reconsidered. You're lucky. A simple farm boy! I fired him in order to re-hire him now. What's it about? I've given him a life after death. He'll be eternally grateful. From now on he's ours. He's my choice for our next Chief Manager. Use your men's strengths and weaknesses both. Saints are the worst employees. What about Manager Dai? Manager Dai is a saint, too spotless to be controlled. I know Manager Dai to be wise and earnest. Dai surpasses you in competence and intelligence. If he became Chief Manager, you'd be his lackey. Rulers command by reward, recognition and fear. We may reward and recognize Dai's accomplishments, but we can't make him fear us if we can't punish him for his flaws. Qiu pales before Dai in every way, which is why Qiu is our safest choice. Third, I'm getting old. It's up to you now. You've got the look of a warrior, there's a leader in you yet. Our future rests with you. Be nice to your wife. Our bloodline depends on the two of you. You must sleep in your wife's chamber. Tell her we the Kangs forbid concubines and divorces but she can't smoke opium. Make her quit. Once she quits opium, have a baby boy. All right? Look at the result of salt deficiency. We've hit it big! Time to sell the salt! 1 tael of silver for 1 kilo of salt? Look how sick they are. The market could not be better. The time is ripe. Sell it. Yes. Be careful so no one sees you. Third Master! I come to pay Mother a visit. How are you, Mother? I'm fine. Have a seat. I came to say goodbye. Where are you going? The Gobi Desert. To follow in my ancestors steps. - Your father allows it? - Even if he doesn't, I'm going. I see... Maybe someday I can persuade your father to let me visit your ancestral site. I'll visit you. Then I'll show you all the fun things and all the best places. I'm good at that. When do you leave? Tomorrow. When are you coming back? I don't know. I'm leaving. You... Take care of yourself. Take good care of yourself. Yes. You get up! All these years, it breaks my heart to watch you self-destroy. Now you'll see the outside world. I'm happy for you. Mother, please stay well. Goodbye. But I heard you may hurt. I'm scared. Me too. Should I? I'm sorry. I'm sorry... Did it hurt that much? Now... we're grown-ups. I want to marry you. I will marry you. Third Master! I have something for you. My father bought it in Paris. Useful in the desert. Your father didn't leave you much. Please keep it. You don't have anything from me. I want nothing from home. It's from me. Even if I took it, what difference would it make? You're no more than my stepmother. Let's accept our fate. Take care, Stepmother. You listen to me! I encouraged your friendship with Madame Kang because I wanted us to move closer to the centers of power of the town. That proved to be a mistake. Now with these Boxer rebels in sighting, violence against foreigners all over the country, it is very important that we do not antagonize her husband. So, I want you to go home. I'm doing God's work just like you are. I haven't done anything wrong. If I'm becoming a problem to the Church, I'll leave the Church. And if you... so object to my association with Madame Kang... I'll leave you too. You did not tell me that's why you wanted to see Dr. Wilson. You know your family enjoys all sorts of advantages from your husband. Why would you do this to him? Life is a compromise. You think my marriage is any better? Haven't you seen my husband drinking? What are you going to do? Don't do this, you could die. If you do this, and you change your mind, you will always regret it. With or without your help, I will do this. If we only remove the uterus it will be a simpler procedure. Madame... Say it! She asked the foreign doctor... to cut out... her... uterus. She can't bear children anymore. Oh, Master! Manager Qiu! I went by your house but you had left. Young Master. What's with your horse? I'm training my legs to serve Old Master better. Come on! Look! A graveyard for foot traders. Some of my ancestors may be lying here. It's haunted. Wolves are around, too? If you're tapped on the shoulder after sunset, don't turn around. The wolf will rip your throat out. - That's a tall tale! - It's for real. I've got a lot to learn. You have to teach me. How dare I? You watch me. I won't make mistakes now. Believe me, Manager Qiu. I come to learn. Anyone can punish me if I make another mistake. Manager Qiu. You're a man with ambition. Don't degrade yourself. Lord Kang's here. - Who? - Lord Kang. Lord Kang. Manager Dai, an unwanted guest's here! I came to buy guns. Westerners and churches bought theirs. It's time we did the same. Beijing is in trouble. The Boxer rebels seem to be making inroads. We should move our silver South. But the roads aren't safe anymore. I... I'll go to Fujian. Yes? Perhaps I can persuade the Governor to transfer his tax fund through us. Good. Silver in Beijing goes into the Treasury and silver in Fujian stays in the South. Other provinces can follow. We'll empty our vaults before war comes. There's another matter I want to ask you about. The difficult national politics... and my own domestic problems. Our bank's future now rests with you. We ought to be one family. What do you think about becoming my godson? Lord Kang... please don't overburden me. I admire you. I don't have to be your son to be loyal to you. Please don't worry. I mean well. It's my responsibility to be loyal. We'll speak no more of this. Please get up! I'm grateful for your trust. Manager Dai... How I wish you were my son! Your 3rd load of tax silver. Don't close down even if you've emptied your vaults. The market counts on banks like yours. We're only trying to earn transfer fee, Sir. Allied Forces landed in Tianjin. BEIJING BRANCH CLOSES DOWN Have you come this way often? At 18, when I finished training, my first post was the Gobi Desert. Want some wine? Horses are a handful. Take a torch! Manager Qiu. Don't move. Wolves are scared of the sound of traps, right? Come! My life is yours from now on. Lives, men's or horses', are lost in the blink of an eye. But... This experience was good for us. Get up. Get up! I'm not my father, you don't have to do this. I'll take this. Thank you. Goodbye. Break your engagement to marry her? But she's your teacher! You're way out of line! Madame has stayed in bed for a month. Can she go bathing tomorrow? Madame! Madame! Please come back! It's not safe! Madame! Please come back! It's not safe! Come back please! We have to get help! Who can swim? Madame! MONGOLIAN TRADE MARKET Madame passed away. It's been 8 days. The family's waiting for you. Third bow. Rise. Ceremony over. Back to your places. Back to your place! Get up. You're out of line! Save some face. She was your stepmother. No more than your stepmother... Third! Third Master... The family needs you. I must know your whereabouts. I'll go join Manager Dai. How was Manager Qiu? Fine. You'd best stay home until your wife gets pregnant. Our family line depends on you. Act responsibly. Our bloodline's at risk. Don't leave! Fourth... Chief, the armies are coming. What? Stop! Stop! Are you Tian Cheng Yuan Bank? Yes. - Is Manager Dai back? - He's in Shanghai. The French and German United Army is coming. The Imperial family has already left. The sooner you leave the better. Our ancestors will bear witness. Read this carefully. “Under the hillock, beneath the rose bed, "left of the ancient pine..." Memorize it! These nine secret vaults hold 3 million taels of silver accumulated over a century. Your brothers and I will stay behind to guard them. If the vaults survive, we'll rebuild our bank after the war. Rebuild? Manager Dai has achieved too much for our good. In addition, he has three male heirs. You choose him, our bank will become his. Manager Qiu, however, is without sons. He's the only one you can rely on. You have to trust my experience in this. This is our final parting, allow me my last wish. Father! Your choice between Dai and Qiu decides the future of our family. I'll do as you say. - Don't ever forget. - I won't. But I can't leave my family behind, engulfed in war. We live only to continue our bloodline. From now on, you are our future. For the family's sake, take care of yourself. Hurry! Don't let it fall. Hurry up! Get the harness on! Third Master! Come with me. Lies, all lies! Again! We faked the funeral because divorce wasn't possible. When will you stop messing with me? Don't think you can just leave. Speak... Say it! Why did you marry him? You said you'd stay single. My father told me I was to be your concubine. From the day I taught in your house your father had plans for me. He had a deal with my father. You... my concubine? Why didn't you leave? Because". At least I could still see you. But now... I'm leaving. Where? How? America. Mrs. Landdeck's waiting for me. I really have to leave or I'll go mad. I trapped you... yet I held a grudge against you. I hated you... I hated you. Many nights I dreamed of you holding me like this. In the dream I told myself not to wake up... Please don't wake up. In the night, it hurts so much wanting you... I'm leaving with you. You head a family now. How can you? I'll just leave. You'll regret it. And then you'll blame me. Then what are we to do? I took only this when I left your house. Whenever I look at it, I feel we're together. Remember you had a soft heart when you were young. Don't become like your father, then we will always be together. In my entire life, you are my only thought. If I perish in fire, my heart will be the ashes on your clothes. Maybe someday... wherever you are, I'll come to see you. Yes. You will let me know where you are. You will write me. Yes. Stay well. Yes. Stay alive. Good news! The foreign army has changed direction. Old Master tells you to go visit Manager Qiu. Tell my father I'll go visit Manager Dai in Shanghai. Man's stronger without desires. I never wanted to head the family. Old Master wants only the best for Third Master. Give this message to him: If he wants me to care for myself, he shouldn't mold me in his image. Yes. Also... I saw her, alive. Go. Will they continue this thing? Madame's on board the ship. I taught him the art of controlling men, now he uses it on me. I told you Third's a warrior, he's got what it takes. Third Master has Master's blood in him. If he plays it hard, I'll play it soft. Tiger father, tiger son. I won't ruin our family for a woman. Let him go carve out his own world. If he fails, I'll pick up the pieces for him. How about you, Sir? A widower remarries. No one can criticize you for that. This time I'll listen to you. Find me a country woman who can bear children. No more fancy stuff. Much obliged. What can we learn? Taking on small clients is easy, getting loan collaterals is not. We lend to the Court, we can't ask for collaterals. Peace treaty signed! The Court will return to Beijing! The silver market will be moving again. Brother! Using your passage again! You're welcome. Safe journey! Bring some women back! This is from our new National Bank. This is the first time I see one. Such a light piece of paper is worth 100 silver taels! How can that be? The Court used to forbid paper money. Our trade was born from the danger of shipping silver. Now paper money... We should just retire and go home! I have a suggestion: Silver transfer is obsolete. The National Bank took over our clients. We can't fight the Court. But they forget China has the largest population in the world. If we take on small clients, together they are a force. Like ants build anthills, the working people can build us a mountain. ONE TAEL OPENS AN ACCOUNT I've never seen so much cheer at a bank. Bringing working people in... Feels good. Mutton buns, steamed buns! - Cabbage, Sir? - Get lost! Manager Qiu! Manager Dai. Lord Kang sent me to visit you. Third Master! It's been a year since the Gobi Desert. How are you? Why are you in Beijing? I'm here to see if “One Tael Opens an Account” can go nationwide. Are you to be the Chief Manager? I'll go home to inform Father that I'm moving headquarters to Beijing. He won't be making the decisions anymore. These dirty children are now our source of income. This may not be to your taste. Catch! Manager Dai. Before I went to Shanghai, I told Father I needed you as Chief Manager. What do you think? These are dangerous times. That's why I need you. I speak from the heart, please consider it. Lord Kang will never agree. He has already agreed. He wants Manager Qiu. But he has already agreed. Impossible! Do you want me to swear by my ancestors? I will do my very best. We're taking on the challenges of our time. I thank you. Command as you wish. TEN YEARS LATER THE NATIONALIST REVOLUTION Dear Father: The nation is suffering. Though our situation is dire, I can still manage. Five branches in Nanking and Canton were plundered and burned. Shanghai Shipyards was burned, the Court debtor has disappeared. Our debt collection rate is now under 10%. Liquidity and staff loyalty are my greatest worries. Manager Qiu's en route with the silver back to Shanxi. I don't know if he has arrived and I'm concerned. Alert! Manager Qiu, find cover. Manager Qiu! Manager Qiu, from now on we don't know each other. Qiu hasn't arrived. The bodyguard company knows the road well. Let's wait. We'll wait. If mass withdrawals begin nationwide, the situation will be hard to control. If the Qing dynasty falls... If the Qing dynasty falls... its paper money will be worthless. What about the working people's deposits? They trust us. Business is business. What else can we do? I want real silver! Hurry up! Hand over the silver or we'll arrest you. - We are reputable... - Real silver! Paper money is silver, it's backed up by silver... I want real silver! Arrest him! Either silver or arrest! Real silver! Take him away! Please, I beg you! I beg you! We'll release him when you pay up. If not, we'll arrest your chairman. Take him away! Take the back door. Those commoners outside... Please, out the back way! Give us back our silver! Burn the place down! Don't set a fire! Listen to me! Not to worry, If you think the Court can't back up these bills, come and... burn them! You and the Court are in it together! We'll never betray your trust. But our vaults are empty. Burn the place down! The Court's paper money is as good as silver. If you want to withdraw, please come in. Silver to buy rice! Nobody takes paper money now. You deposited paper money. It's only fair that we repay you in paper money. Call that fair? It was money when deposited. Now it's scrap paper. That's right! Our life savings! Have pity on us! Get up, get up. Give us back our silver! We want silver, I won't live anymore! Hold him! No. Hold him. Someone! Come! Help! Someone! Help! Help! Pa... Papa What would you do if you were me? Father. You think you can use our savings to pay the Court's debts? We have substance, we won't starve even if we go bankrupt. But the small people... "Be righteous." Isn't it our company code? You use the Code against me! The stench of a man burning... I seduced them into banking with us. 30 taels of silver. Your ancestor borrowed it to start our family fortune. Read this carefully. Your ancestor decreed with interest, it equals 1/3 of our worth, 5 vaults of silver. You can take the remaining 4 vaults to help the poor. But you can't touch what's not yours. You talk about being righteous. This is being righteous! Our ancestor got the silver because he gave his last bowl of porridge for a life. When I said you've got the air of a warrior... I didn't know you'd be hurting your own. One man, one life... How it's lived determines its worth. Doing business is but conducting oneself. You're lecturing me? I betrayed someone. My life's now a shell. I owe you two nothing! She told me to stay true to my nature! If I ever see her again, I want to hold my head up. I don't talk to you about her, it's shameful! Father! Our name was built up over a century. Those who win hearts rule the world. We will earn our money back. All the generations of our family, in your eyes, cannot compete with a woman. Nine vaults of silver in exchange for a son's heart. Is it worth it? So be it. So be it. You do well by her, but you betray your ancestors. You'll be heavily in debt. I will repay them. Such naiveté... I will repay them. You won't be able to. Get up! Xia! Xia! Open the vaults tomorrow. Summon the family. Yes, Sir. My first memory as a child happened that fateful evening, cradled at my father's chest. I bore a son for you to carry on our line. If he grows up to be capable, then we'll have done our duty to our ancestors. The smell of his tobacco, the rustling of his silk robe, his beard on my cheek... Bring him up well. The candlelight... Dad... This is all I can do for our family. Make our ancestors proud! Even at that age, I knew it was a moment I had to remember. Third Master. I've searched everywhere in vain. - You've looked everywhere? - Everywhere! But a horse is missing from the stables. My father, your great-grandfather, disappeared that day. No one saw him again nor found out where he went. KINDNESS RIGHTEOUSNESS Life is mysterious... We all pray that it doesn't challenge us with hard choices. Dad! We haven't betrayed our ancestors. No matter where you are... feel comforted. We did the right thing. We did the right thing together. But it is when we face hard choices that we become in touch with our true natures and define who we are. Gentlemen! Our trip to Beijing will bring you great danger on my account. I thank you. I grew up under my brother's care during the wars. I admired him not only because he was my surrogate father,
