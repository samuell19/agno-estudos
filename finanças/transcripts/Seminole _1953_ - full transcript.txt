* THE SEMINOLE * This is a story about the Seminoles Indians,... and his Chief Osceola. An account taken from the pages of History. "FORT KING US ARMY HEADQUARTERS FLORIDA TERRITORY THE YEAR 1835 " By the current regulation, I, Colonel Zachary Taylor... I declare this Martial Court open. Mr. Gerad, make the charge. According to Lieutenant Lance Caldwell, please stand up. According to Lieutenant Caldwell, he is being charged... of disobeying orders... premeditated insubordination and murder. You've heard the charge, Mr. Caldwell. How do you declare? Guilty or innocent? Innocent. Do you have anything to say in your defense? Yes sir. But, I ask permission from the Court to report my version of the facts... as they occurred. Permission granted. But I must warn you that whatever you say... may be used against you. This Court will judge you fairly and impartially... but if found guilty, the penalty determined by law... is the death. You got it? I understood. All right, go on. Sit in the place of the witnesses and report the facts. I'll tell you everything, just as it happened exactly... from the moment of my arrival in the Territory of Florida. I was circling the marshes off the coast, 15 km from Fort King. It was a beautiful morning in Florida and it was good to come home. My promotion to Second Lieutenant, Army of the United States... I had just left and I felt very important. The four long years at the Academy seemed to have been a long time ago. Seminoles? Yes. For some time they have been roaming the Territory stealing supplies and equipment. I was attacked by one of them on the road. Without a doubt, an explorer. I do not understand, the Seminoles are peaceful. The military thought this until they stole their horses. It is incredible that they are at war. I do not believe. For three months that has been happening. The Army needs to find out what's going on. I'll find out. I'll find the answer at Fort King. High! Who's coming? Lieutenant Lance Caldwell, introducing himself to the post. Welcome to Fort King, sir. Thank you, Corporal. I'll take your horse, sir. Thank you. Good day sir. Good Morning. Lieutenant Caldwell. Oh, Lieutenant. The Major is waiting for him. Lieutenant Caldwell, sir. Introducing yourself to the service. Mr. Caldwell, what happened to your looks? It turns out, sir, that I had a skirmish down the road... We're very clean here, Mr. Caldwell. from the riding saddles to the epaulettes of the Officers. Introduce yourself again when you are in a clean uniform. That's all, Mr. Caldwell. You're dismissed! "MAJOR DEGAN" In between! According to Lieutenant Caldwell, sir. Welcome to Fort King, Mr. Caldwell. Please sit down. Please. You mentioned, a skirmish. Yes. I was attacked by a Seminole. I think he was an observer. Oh, ah... Did you capture him? Do not. He escaped. And that's what you called a skirmish, Lieutenant? The Seminoles, Major... have always been a peaceful tribe. I've never seen you act like this. You were sent to me because you know them well! and knows the Territory. But times have changed, sir. Come here. The South, Lieutenant. Land ready for cultivation... and become the agricultural heart of the country... if it were not for certain obstacles. The Cherokees here... the Choctaws here... and the Seminoles here. The Indians occupy a large part of the best lands... and can not take advantage of it, because they do not know its value. The Government has decided to send them to a reservation in the West... with provisions, plenty of water... and the opportunity to learn, to work the land. The neighboring tribes, for the most part, accepted the change. But not the Seminoles. Only the Seminoles disobeyed my orders. Why sir? Because they have a leader. A powerful leader, named Osceola. He believes that all his men are willing to fight for him. The Seminoles live in swamps... without utility, to the white man. I am a soldier, not a politician. And you must remember that you are, only a soldier, Mr. Caldwell. A newly promoted lieutenant. Orders, Lieutenant. And my orders are to get them out of here and take them west. That is what I intend to do, as long as I have the necessary forces. But I know your language, sir, your customs. Maybe if I can talk to this Osceola... Mr. Caldwell, keep this in mind. Talking times are over! They had the chance to go peacefully! And just... a small piece of information that might be useful to you... while you're serving here in Fort King. At the Academy, Mr. Caldwell, I was number one in my class. Major number one! I have studied the regulation very thoroughly. I live by the regulation, I fight according to the regulation... and command this Second Fort determines the regulation. You were sent to me, to be an explorer. And your job. I'll climb it to control actions, until I'm ready... to confront me, with Osceola. Dispensed. Yes sir. But if the Major consents, I request permission, to leave the Fort tonight. Personal matters. Sign the registration book at Sergeant Smiley's office. And be back before midnight. Thank you sir. Sergeant Magruder! Make yourself comfortable. I am placing you under the orders of the new Officer, According to Lieutenant Caldwell. He will be our explorer. He was born in this region. It is good to have a man who knows the Seminoles. He knows them in depth. The problem is whether he wants to fight them. It seems the new lieutenant is not convinced... that our methods are correct, to deal with Osceola. Do not lose sight of him and tell me everything. Sergeant Magruder, this is an order! "MULDOON COMMERCIAL POSITION" Mr. Lance! MS. Revere? Throw! How long have... Five years. Let me look at you. Why did not you tell me? I bring you the letter I wrote. My horse is faster than the Mail. You do not need to read this. Just say I'm coming... and that I still feel, the same for you. Mr. Lance, you've grown a lot. You're a soldier now, as you always wanted to be. I remember you running with John. and firing with toy weapons. Mattie Sue, why do not you prepare something to eat for the lieutenant? No, thanks, I already had dinner at the Fort. What a beauty! Well, then, why do not you leave us alone? Were you in Fort King today? I was assigned there. Now you will have me continuously by your side. Fort King is just a small garrison. What do you want another Officer for? It was a small garrison... it is no more. If, within a month, the Seminoles do not transfer to the West... the Army will force them. Seminoles are our friends. That's what I told Major. It is not about the people, but about their leader. A Chief named Osceola. It seems that he deceives them, does not want to lose the power. Now this is the behavior of an Officer. All this time, just talking about the Army. This is not very romantic. You're a grown woman, Revere. Loneliness ages us quickly. And has loneliness changed your way of thinking about us? Changed? What a beautiful childhood ours is, Lance. We were very happy. The three of us? Yes. Tell me what happened. I think you know. About John? He disappeared, that's all. Because? Does not make sense. For years we dreamed of joining the Academy together. It was our biggest dream. And when the time comes, it does not appear. Because? John was different from us. We knew that from the beginning. He thought in a deeper way. I'm sure he had his reasons, to leave. I have tried to convince myself that it was due to his family. Maybe he was afraid of being discriminated against. No, John was proud of his Indian mother. So you should be proud to be the first Indian... admitted at West Point. Why would he do that? Maybe someday we'll know. But you must stop worrying now. How do I stop worrying about losing my best friend? Maybe even something, more important. What do you think about this? Looks like it was like I saw you yesterday. Give me time. I want to meet him again. You know, Revere, I think I'll take it, the dinner you offered me. Mattie Sue. Mattie Sue! Mr. Lance changed his mind. He is hungry. I'm glad you're back. When will I see him again? Whenever you have one minute free. I have many things to tell you, I have not yet said. I hope I have the opportunity. Thank you. Good night, Lance. Good night, Revere. Why did you come? Peace, warrior Kajeck. Kaluk, I came to see your Chief. It is not wise, for you to be here, now. I bring an important message. I do not trust you. Silence, young man! He's on the Council with his Heads. Come on, let's find him. You broke, your promise. We agreed that she would only come if I called her. John, I could not wait. I broke my promise because I bring news from the Army. The Army has nothing to do with this. As I told my Heads, these troops will soon go west. No, John. They prepare to attack you. How do you know this? I talked to one of the Officers. Her name is Lance Caldwell. Did you send for us? Yes. Willing to see the Cherokee renegades? Speak in english! Ms. Muldoon is our friend. We leave in an hour, to meet them. Soon we will have enough weapons to fight with the soldiers. And always live in disgrace! I do not get it. This meeting was his wish. I wanted my people to be free. That is why I allowed the renegades to hide... in the swamp, in exchange for weapons. There was no other choice. And now? Ms. Muldoon brought me the news. A man I've known all my life, is among the Officers of the Fort. I trust him. I'll arrange a meeting and we'll talk. Let's get the guns first. Then you will. What you want? Find the renegades, as we agreed. But do not make a deal this time. Ms. Muldoon will return to Fort to find my friend. What if this friend does not want to listen? Then the guns will speak. Soon the rains will come. If there is no peace, we will remain in the marshes. Do not be fooled. The food we steal will not be enough... many will die. We should take this chance. I say to fight. You are the leader we choose. You say there is hope, I will repeat your words. You will stay in the village. I'll go with my father. Why are you doing this to me? You will stay, my son. It is not possible to seek peace, when hatred blinds sight. The impetuosity of youth is not necessary. Yes father. Come here. Kaluk. Kaluk, avoid the soldiers. There should be no more blood until... all the chances are tempted. It will be as you say. Sleep here tonight and at dawn, my warriors, will take you back. Go find him immediately and reveal to him my identity. Revere... Lance will talk to me, will not he? I'm sure of that, John. I wanted to spend tonight with you... let's not waste it. What is it, John? I was thinking about Lance. The dream is over. Lance came back, you belong to him. I belong to you, John. You know my feelings perfectly. But Lance is good... has a brilliant career as an Army Officer... and he's white, like you. And you're an Indian. The leader of a tribe, who fights. Also could have been Official, but decided that his place was here... helping his people. What if I fail? Could you live in a miserable village like this? It does not have to be like this, not if there is peace. Will your society accept me as your husband? Revere, I think about your future. You and Lance belong to the same world. Give Lance the opportunity to show you your world before you decide. All right, John. Let's wait. No, Revere, I'll wait. I found a group, Lieutenant. Taft was watching... while I came to get him. Dismount! I'm glad you're here, Lieutenant. What happened? I was discovered, so I opened fire. I took one of them and the other three fled. Four against one and fled? Yes sir. All right, soldier. Tell me what happened. That's what I said, sir. Against four would not stand a chance, and this man was slain in the back. I thought they had seen me, I could have sworn. Before they attacked me, I shot. By back? How did you hit him in the back? Sorry, Lieutenant, the question is confusing, but he's almost a boy. They saw him, and they left without a fight, am I right? I do not know, sir. I can not remember. They left without a fight, but panicked and shot at them... the rest ran away, did not happen? Yes sir. That's how it happened. All right, go back to your place. Yes sir. Maybe I would have done the same, Lieutenant. It could be a trap. It's more than that, this man is a Boss. It is seen by his clothes. Maybe it's Osceola. With the drums, I will send a message to the watchmen, to give him a horse. Run to Fort with, my message. The rest depends on Lance. Yes sir? Mr. Caldwell, I was expecting you to talk about today's incident. I read your report and wanted to ask you some questions. Yes sir. Why, Mr. Caldwell? Why, in your opinion... Did the Seminoles avoid fighting? Because, as I said, sir, they are not bellicose. Oh... I believe they are waiting for the chance to resolve this peacefully. So why did he punish a man who did his duty? I am aware of your attitude to Private Taft. He admitted that the Indians did not attack him. They had a meeting and they saw him there. They were in greater numbers, but they refused to fight. This demonstrates their good faith. And the fact of stealing food and horses, is another demonstration of good faith? Mr. Caldwell, you were sent to me for exploration missions. So, you must give me information... and do not tell me why or how I should fight. And one more thing: I do not want any soldier under my command... be punished for killing an enemy. Is that clear? Yes sir. Good morning, Mr. Caldwell. Sergeant Smiley, bring your schedule. Meeting of Officers, tonight at eight. Come and write. To the General's Office. Subject matter: According to Lieutenant Lance Caldwell. Behavior. I called them, gentlemen, because the time has come.... to plan a final action against the Seminoles. This morning's events... convinced me that Osceola at this time... he has neither warriors nor weapons for a long campaign. So I decided to attack him, with a small detachment... immediately. Hidden in your village... he considers the swamps, as his silent defenders... and is convinced that we can not reach him. Well, gentlemen, that's exactly what I want him to think. Because a surprise attack now and its capture... will totally disorganize, the Seminoles... before they join the other tribes and renegades. Now... some of you, gentlemen, still do not know this Territory. The new Officer, Mr. Caldwell, lived in Florida, gentlemen... and will bring you up to date on everything about the region. Those who do not follow me tomorrow will be able to use your information... in future expeditions. Oh, Mr. Caldwell, please. May I suggest speaking to you privately, Major? Mr. Caldwell, I summoned this meeting to inform all my Officials. Whatever you want to tell me, you can tell them. Very good, sir. I beg you, respectfully... that the attack be canceled, against the Seminoles. I think it is very dangerous to enter the swamps, at this time of year. And I believe that special training is needed to fight there. Mr. Caldwell, just one question, please. When you say it's too dangerous, you mean it's impossible? No sir. That is all. The list of participants will be displayed on the board. Be prepared at 6:00 a.m., with food and paraphernalia for seven days. Gentlemen, you may withdraw. Mr. Caldwell, please stay. Now, sir, tell me, what did you have in mind when you made this request? I asked the Major to speak privately. I'd like to know, Lieutenant, your reasons for suggesting... that I would cancel my orders. With the rains coming, the Seminoles will be forced to... to seek high ground. It will be easy to capture them. If we give them time, they will accumulate weapons and ammunition... to sustain an endless campaign. I'm doing my job, sir. My duty is to warn you. According to you, it is impossible to enter the jungle and defeat Osceola. It will be a surprise attack, a calculated risk. You just tell me how to get there, I'll do the rest. Mr. Caldwell... try to prepare the most appropriate route plan... that I'll send for in an hour. In between. Major's plan, sir. I came to pick you up. Here it is. Sergeant. Make yourself comfortable! How long have you been with Major? Ten years, sir. I was with him throughout the Creek expedition. The Major has a good record. You should be proud to serve with him. I am, he is a good Officer. But it's been three years since he's expected to be promoted to Lieutenant-Colonel. You must have patience with him. I get it. Lieutenant, on the Creek expedition there was an Officer, not West Point... who made a lot of money as an informant of the red skins. We lost many men before we discovered it. You think he suspects me? He seeks to win, a war. Admit it gave you reason to be alarmed. Maybe it is that. This will be between us. Good evening, sir. Prepare! Form column! In column two from the right! Cape of the Guard, a stranger is approaching. Who goes there? My name is Muldoon. I need to see Lieutenant Caldwell immediately. Impossible, miss. Your detachment left an hour ago. Do you know when you'll be back? It is hard to say. And I do not think I can reach it. Your horse looks tired. Hey, you do not own the Post? Yes I am. Go there. When the lieutenant comes back, I'll tell him to look for her. Please, do it. It's very important. Tell the officer we saw one of the stolen horses... and which was not assembled, by any Indian. On the right! High! High! Call Sergeant Magruder. Sergeant Magruder! Ready. Yes sir! Leave the horses with two men and take the others with the cart. To do what, sir? Push it, Sergeant Magruder. I want to keep advancing, with the cannon and ammunition. I can control the noise of men, not animals. Dismount and return to training. Prepare to disassemble! Disassemble! There is no reason for me to tell you my intentions. However, I chose to do so. I will attack these savages, with this reduced detachment... because my purpose is, to overcome them by surprise... and not by numerical superiority. From now on, no man will speak louder than a whisper. This is my order. Mr. Caldwell, issue a march order. Yes sir. Attention! Thank you, Mr. Caldwell. Your arm broke, Major. Put it in the wagon. Let's move on, Mr. Caldwell. You know what? All this is making me stay ambitious. You, ambitious? What you mean? Yes, it's the first time in my life, that I would like an Officer in charge. How is he, Mr. Caldwell? You're on fire, sir. Major? Yes, Corporal? Sorry for yelling. I did not know, what I was doing. It's okay, son. Mr. Caldwell, please remind the men... that any future incident could endanger... the success of this whole operation. Sergeant Magruder? Yes sir. When they have cleaned, the equipment satisfactorily... have them eat and rest, as comfortably as possible. Yes sir. And Sergeant. Please tell the men, I'm satisfied with them. Thank you sir. Mr. Caldwell. Yes sir. How long will it take us to reach the village of the Seminoles? In the next step, I think... How much, Mr. Caldwell? One more day, at most. As you can see, Mr. Caldwell, so far... we have advanced as I had predicted in my plan. Bear in mind that the Indians of the swamps are no different... of the forest Indians. And I do not feel sorry for them. Major? I suggest you allow the soldiers to loosen their collar. Do not you know the rules, Mr. Caldwell? Quicksand! Quicksand! I want that gun. Come on. Get that gun. Throw me a rope! Here it is! Watch his arm. He is alive? Yes sir. Mr. Caldwell. The order was to save the cannon. I thought it was more important to save a life. And endanger those of the other twenty men, Lieutenant? That cannon was for our protection. All right, we'll hide in the jungle. In training immediately. Prepare them to march. They are ready, sir! Rest. Each time it displeases to him, more to have to attack these Indians. It is noted as we move forward. All I ask is a chance to resolve this peacefully. This is what we would all like. Well, almost everyone. I never took part in such a risky expedition. Yes. We can choose to die drowned, sweaty or in the hands of the Indians. Who says we'll be lucky enough to meet the Indians? He went mad because of the fever. Bind him and gag him. Gag it? Lord, with this fever... I know, Mr. Caldwell. Gag it! How to fight the swamp? Mr. Caldwell. Mr. Caldwell! Are we still far? No sir. We'll send scouts. Magruder! Magruder! Magruder! Magruder, explore the terrain. You, that someone accompanies you. Yes sir. Mr. Caldwell, please, Have the men clean their weapons. Yes sir. Mr. Caldwell. Please sit down. Allow me. Before you find these savages, have you checked if your saber is sharp? Major! We found them, Major. They are celebrating something. There is no doubt, sir. They are Seminoles. Very well. Mr. Caldwell, let's take a look at the enemy? What do you think, Mr. Caldwell? It's not a war dance, it's more like a party. They do not know we're here. I bet not. Let's wait, lie down. Then we will fall on them and exterminate them. At dawn we will return home. We're ready, sir. Good. Good. What shall we do with the Cape, sir? We will pick you up after the attack. Load it again! They fled! They fled! Why do not you come back and fight? Why not...? They saved him. They saved the lieutenant. Good for him. Let's try to save ourselves, too. You are the boss... Osceola? Are you Osceola? Do not move, Lieutenant... the leaves and the clay will absorb, the venom of their wounds. Why did they spare me? I ask the same question. Because? Maybe as a hostage. Or perhaps because my mighty Chief has white blood in his veins. Why did we save this man? I am your leader and do not have to give you explanations. His confidence in this soldier caused my father's death. I demand revenge! If my acts offend my people, I will respond to the Council. Now go! How do you feel, Lance? John? Why did not you let me die with my men... as a soldier? I do not know. I do not know why they did not kill him. The blood of my people is in your hands. You are responsible for this massacre. Massacre? Yes, I only wanted peace. His soldiers were the first to attack. I was hoping that I would contain my warriors... after what have you done? Why did not you listen to Revere? Revere? She went to him to explain to him, my peace plan. I only saw her once... and she did not tell me anything. John... Are you and Revere? Who knows? Who knows anything? Rest, Lance, we'll talk later. It's ok. This report is not good, Captain. It is not good. But, they all demonstrated the highest efficiency. These men have been working hard. Not enough. Double instruction time. Major, I do not think we should... Double the time of instruction, Captain! Yes sir. That's all, Lieutenant. Yes sir. MS. Muldoon? Yes. Please. MS. Muldoon... This is a copy of the letter I sent to the War Department... before undertaking a recent expedition. A part of her interests you. "Lieutenant Lance Caldwell..." "has been demonstrating an attitude at odds with this authority..." "and on several occasions he was rebuked..." "for expressing opinions..." "about what he calls an unfair attitude toward the Seminoles." Keep saying that the Lieutenant has been seen... in company with one Revere Muldoon. The explorers report that Ms. Muldoon... has visited the Osceola camp. That's true, Miss. Muldoon? I have no idea what you're talking about. When you came here looking for Lieutenant Caldwell... rode one of our horses, stolen by the Seminoles. Do you have any comments on this? Muldoon? Major, I was brought here without any explanation. I want to know now, what is all this. I suspect Lieutenant Caldwell and you... be in agreement with the enemy. This is absurd! Sit down. Sergeant Magruder! Sergeant. Sergeant, this is Miss. Muldoon. How are you? How are you? Tell him about Lieutenant Caldwell. The lieutenant was with the expedition that was... exterminated by the Seminoles. Major here, Private Scott and I, we were the only ones, managed to survive. And Lieutenant Caldwell? A strange thing, madame, is that before we begin, Lieutenant... The facts, the facts! He's fine, now, I guess. He was wounded while covering our retreat. But they saved him. I could see when they took him. And as for the others, Magruder, have the Indians spared anyone else? No, sir, as I told you, only him. Mrs. MS. Muldoon... a military man in charge must change tactics... to resolve, a military situation. I decided to solve this matter of the Seminoles at once... peacefully, making a pact with Osceola myself. You are the only person who can go to the village of the Seminoles. Go there. If you and Lieutenant Caldwell can convince Osceola... to come and talk to me it will dispel my suspicions of your loyalty. And what will happen to Osceola? MS. Muldoon, he'll come here with a flag of peace. And if I refuse... What would that mean for you? More troops coming, to Fort King? Maybe the command change. Perhaps. Possibly it would be the ruin of my entire military career. If that happened, Miss. Muldoon, it would mean... prison for you and Martial Court, for Lieutenant Caldwell. When you think you can leave? I'll go in the morning. I'll make the necessary arrangements. John, I'm sorry I disappointed you. A lot of blood was shed and there were many dead. But I bring a message from the Army, They make a peace offer. Peace? John, I know Lance is here. I need to talk to both of you. He's in my tent. I hope you will soon get out of your wounds. Revere, I told you everything. I'll go to him. I'll come later. You'd better talk to them first. Throw. Hi, ah... It's good to see you're fine. I thought my injuries could be a solution... convenient for you and John. I should die. Some things for us take time to forget. He said he sent for me. What happened, Revere? I arrived an hour late. Okay, it's done. There is nothing left to say. Throw... the Army knows it's alive. The army? How could they know? Sergeant Magruder, Scott, and Major escaped with their lives. The sergeant saw when, they saved him. So, they think, I'm a traitor. I told you I'd be better off dead. No man is better off dead, my friend. Listen, Lance, the Major wants to end the fight. That's why I came. Yes, he asks you to take it, John under a white flag... to discuss peace. Discuss the peace? Do not you see? Must come back. You have to face reality, Lance. Many things have happened, I do not believe there can be peace. But I have to believe, that is a chance of peace, for our people. Let's go back. My people... there are many causes of bitterness between us and whites. And even if it is not easy to forget them... they beckon us with another chance to negotiate peace. I'll try again, their hands in peace. His hands are armed as ever, and ready to exterminate us. I have the word of your leader. I'm going to Fort King. Pray that everything will go well. I'm Lieutenant Hamilton. Major's order, sir. Change your uniform, please, and introduce yourself to your office. The Chief will come with me. Thank you, Lieutenant. You'll be fine, John. At your disposal, Lieutenant. They beat Osceola and threw him into the dungeon. Osceola in the dungeon? Who gave the order? Degan? Stay away and open up. I have order... I said open it! Bring the ladder here. John, what did they do to you? They wanted me to sign the surrender, of my people unconditionally... and I refused. Are you seriously injured? I think so, Lance John... Do you think I betray you? What does it matter who betrayed me? Your Major is a fool, Lance. This will make my people decide to continue the war. Wait, Lieutenant, I'm going to announce it. Major Degan. Here it is customary to announce the visits of the subordinate Officers. Osceola was betrayed under, the white flag. If you want to make any comments, be more respectful. The message you sent was a trap. Osceola violated the truce. I made him an offer of peace and he refused. She refused because she gave him no hope. Do you forget that a whole patrol was decimated by these savages? I suffered a defeat at Osceola's hands... the first defeat in my entire career. Now he's my prisoner. You have lost all sense of honor and decency. His sense of honor and decency is not recognized by this command. Good day sir. Osceola came because he had confidence in me. And it will leave here as it arrived, with dignity. Good day sir. If he offers you good conditions, he will accept. I will not offer you anything. Remember that this is territory, the United States... and I am responsible, for your protection. And now, get out of here first, have him arrested. I see your sense of duty turned into hatred... which made him lose his mind. Blame the Seminole people for a defeat for which he is responsible. And now, this! Free Osceola. Get out that door. I demand that you release Asceola! Do you require it? Since arriving, you have discussed my orders... and even intended to give them to me. You do not deserve to be an Officer. Let me remind you one more time. This is my command... and I'll keep it up, when I can. You're sick, Major. Seriously ill. Hunm... I know what you'd like. But I will not put, hands on you. Now, give me that back. The only way to get it off my shoulder, will be sending me to a Martial Court. Okay, I'll give it to you. And I'm going to send him to the Martial Court. Sergeant Smiley! Oh, Lieutenant! Lieutenant Caldwell. Sorry, it's Major's orders. He had him arrested, in his lodging. The rains... started. Come on, Lieutenant, let's go inside. Kajeck. We've waited too long. The white man came back to cheat us. Kajeck, I am your leader. You are not a leader. I will not allow you to lead us to disaster. Listen to me, Kajeck. Hurry up! I do not think Osceola will be alive in the morning. Who is on guard? Do not fear, everything is arranged. You must believe, you must have faith! Words! The words killed my father and destroyed you. Look at you! They will not destroy, my people. I will not wait. Kajeck! Kajeck! Kajeck. Kajeck. Lieutenant, I thought you were in jail. Did this Indian kill the sentry? No, Sergeant. Osceola is dead. I hope you know, what you're saying, Lieutenant. Because then, it could only have been you. Just me. Gentlemen, everything I've told you is true. Lieutenant Caldwell, this Court has promised you... a fair and impartial trial. You offered this court very little to be considered. I know, sir. You said that this Indian killed the sentry... to be able to enter the dungeon where Osceola was? Yes sir. But we believed that Osceola was loved and respected by his people. The doctor says Osceola died of drowning. Clearly it was not Seminole who killed him. I fought him, trying to protect the Chief. The sergeant of guard, who found him declared... who saw no trace of Indians when they reached the dungeon. Is there any way to make this Indian appear? No, sir, no way. That's why I have no evidence. I confirm what I said, nothing else. Major Degan, filed suit against Lieutenant Caldwell? When I understood that the violation, of the conduct proper to a soldier... on the part of Lieutenant Caldwell, included murder and treachery... I considered it my duty to draw attention... of the War Department. The letter I have is a copy of the letter sent by Major to Washington... reporting all of the crimes committed by Lt. Caldwell. Did something happen that forced the Major to send this letter? Yes sir. Before calling me, the Major spoke to Lieutenant Caldwell... and reproached his attitude with a patrolman. Something about the Lieutenant telling his men, not to kill the Indians. Can you say that Lieutenant Caldwell was in agreement with the enemy? Well, that's a difficult question... Answer yes or no. Well, yes or no? Yes. You were the sergeant of the guard, in the night, that the sentry was killed? Yes sir. How was he killed? With two stab at the back. And you found a knife? Yeah, a little later. We found it in a well near Lieutenant Caldwell. It's just, Sergeant. The accusation is over. Well, gentlemen, let's make a decision. Write your verdict on these sheets of paper. Guilty or innocent. May the accused rise and go forward. Mr. Caldwell, this Court, found you guilty. You will be taken to the firing squad and executed. We're ready to go, Mr. Caldwell. Allow me, sir. So? Attention! That will not be necessary. Go on with the execution. Prepare! To point! Guards! The fort is surrounded. My voice needs to be heard. I will enter through the gate. Throw your sabers. I came to get Osceola's body... and talk to the one who is in charge. I am the Commander. Speak! I am Kajeck, leader of the Seminoles. The white Maldoon woman was at my camp. She told me about this Officer. I killed the sentry. I wanted to take Osceola away. He was blinded and weakened by his promises and betrayal. A Boss needs to be strong. Strong to face the enemy, always. And you should not rely on a fake white flag, that curls in the wind! Mr. Caldwell? Yes sir. Is this the warrior you spoke of? Yes sir. Kajeck... Why did you come to us to plead guilty? We, Seminoles, are a proud people. No white man should carry my brother. Now let's take him home. Take your boss... and when, time heals the wounds... maybe we can talk again. In using my assignments... I declare that the charges against you have been dropped. And be sure that I will personally investigate... the testimony of Major Degan in this case. Thank you sir. This is good. Get the bossa boss! Attention! Sense! Well, Lieutenant. Yes sir? Maybe it's the beginning of a new way of life. I hope so, sir. I know this people well... and I believe they want to live in peace. Dismiss the troop! Troop, dispense! He was a great man. He loved his people. He loved all people, Lance. That's why it was great.
