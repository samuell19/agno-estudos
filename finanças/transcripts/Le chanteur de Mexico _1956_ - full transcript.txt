How can I help you? - Cartoni, the theater impresario from Paris. - I understand. - He achieved remarkable success. - He deserved. Indeed. Did you hear the concert? - He was good, only that breath. - What breath? Must work on it, make the voice stronger. Please listen. A sufficiently deep breath, would I get involved? - The drum will break. - What do you want? I want to see Vincent, my friend. I'll go get him. You do not need a trumpeter? - In time. - I mean when? I do not know. Please, remember me. And as for the breath ... I'm sorry, it's my turn. I have to go. Give Vincent a business card. I will be in San Sebastian. Hotel Londres. - Walk again? - It's urgent. - You were supposed to play, not fly. - It is really important. - Are you looking for someone? - Vincent. I saw him next to the tavern. But he already went to the church. - Of course, he could go further. - Where? To another place. - Hot, what? - Very. Come with me, quickly. I can not. I assume a thousand francs. It's about millions of francs. I speakseriously. We can make a fortune. - I'll explain to you. - Be right back. Just hurry up. - And what? - He was here a moment ago. - But he is gone. - He could not wait anymore. He left a card. Is at the Hotel Londres. - London, far away. - Hotel Londres, in San Sebastian. - We will go tomorrow. - Do not you think it's a joke? What a job ... If you want to sing here, stay forever. Mexico can seduce. - My impresario must agree. - Cartoni will agree immediately. - It's a business man. - Will you also be able to court? - Possible. - Such a sure success? - Absolutely. - I'm talking about the operetta. Me too. I apologize for being late. Traffic jams. I heard an extraordinary tenor. - Another discovery? - I assure you that ... I have been with Eva for some ideas expecting me. - Mr Martinez has made proposals. - Very interesting. I want to exhibit you the latest operetta. - "Singer from Mexico"? Where? - In Mexico. In Paris she was successful. They will also be enthusiastic there. - When? - As soon as possible. I will hire two artists: Eva Marchall ... - and Miguel Morano. - By originMexican. A few years ago visited his homeland. You need to sign a contract with him. Send him a telegram. - No need, I have it exclusively. - Perfect! All you have to do is agree on the terms. And in the evening we will celebrate the casino. I invite you to Esaka. - Where? - Village, I dropped there for a moment. - I prefer a casino. - Me too. We're here. - Too beautiful and large. - For us. - Here we go. - You brought me here. - You can not withdraw. - Okay, go ahead. - What's so amazing about you? - Luxury, main entrance. - This is an ordinary doorman. - Exactly. Come on. Stupid. I want to listen to how the boy sings. - I apologize to you. - Listen? - To Mr. Cartoni. - He left for Paris in the morning. - Give the address? - No need, we know. - What are we doing? - We go by train. - To Paris? - Are you crazy? To Esaki. Fortune will escape. If we go to Paris ... - Do you have money for travel? - Enough. - Maybe. And what next? - No worries. I have cousin Bidache. He acquired a painting company. He married his daughter ... ... Large family. Only he got rich. Until you become a star live with him. That's how it looks. Miguel, that's important. Listen to me. - I fly to Cannes in 15 minutes. - For what? Nothing special. This offer does not interest me. - I have already signed for you. - No inquiry? It's a mistake. - Do I have exclusivity or not? - Only in Europe, not in America. It's not a matter of price but rules. My last word. - I am also leaving immediately. - To Mexico? To Cannes! Lucy, book a ticket for the Blue Express. - It will be difficult tonight. - Do what I say! Little, I will be back soon. I will keep thinking about you in Paris. And when I come back with money I will give a gift. Leather collar with a bell. Everyone will envy you. Are you saying goodbye? We are late for the train. We have time. Suitcases are already packed. - Suitcases? - Necessary travel items. - Let's bring the sheep. - Who will look after them? - Agostela. - Did you say where we are going? - No, I swear. - No one can know. - The whole village will laugh. - You will succeed. - I will be with you. - For what? To lift your spirits. I can afford it. - I know. - Come. - What happened to you? - I had an accident in skiing. - Disaster. - I will not go to Mexico. Look! - You played before me. - Not necessarily a drama. - Eva is with you? - No. - He does not know you refused. - I will take off this torture tool. - Explain it to me. - Sit down. - Whiskey? - With pleasure. I left five years agoMexico for some reason. I will never go back there, at any price. - Police? - Worse. - Treasury? - Worse. - There is nothing worse. - Look. - Who is it? - Tornanda, leads the ranch. Rides a horse uses a weapon like a cowboy. She swore she would pour me a whip. - Why? - I promised that I would marry her. - You did not keep your word. - No. - Maybe you will change your decision? - I prefer not to risk. Should I tell this story to Martinez? I only shot in Mexico once. Martinez does not know me. The audience barely. - Someone will replace me. - Let him work under your name. I agree. It must be similar to you. Otherwise the number will fail. - The issue of makeup. - A passport? Miguel Moreno is a pseudonym. I let it be used. I do not know an artist who would agree to sing under his own name. One moment. - Do you speak Greek? - Basque. I have! Vicent Etchebar. I need to call the secretary. You have to bring him to Paris When I return to Mexico, I am forced to. That would be the end of everything. - What's going on? - Do you have my ticket? - No. - I put it in my pocket. - I have it somewhere. - Here. - Stupid. - Anyone can happen. Please show. He fell into a hole in his pocket. - Sorry. - Where are we going? - To Cartoni. - With these suitcases? - First, let's refresh ourselves. - Let's go to my cousin. - Where does he live? - At boulevard Batignolles. - Is it far away? - I do not know, let's ask. - How to get to the Batignolles bulevard? - By metro. - I will be happy to use it. - Where should we go? There. Transfer at Stalingrad station. - Stalingrad? - Later... Can I park for 5 minutes? - Where? - There. - It will take us 2 weeks. - We will go on foot. We will get lost. We will go on a carriage. Old but more reliable. I apologize to you ... I mean, lady. On Boulevard Batignolles. - Please get in. - Go ahead. - Why are we standing? - You can not see the light? - Lights? - Red. Already green. - Do you understand anything from this? - Yes. - What? - It's better to pretend to understand ... than to admit that you do not understand.Understand? - Look how tall. - July column. Have you heard? We are on the Bastille square. - Where is Bastille? - Does not exist anymore. We arrived too late. A Champs Elysees, Arc de Triomphe, Pigalle Square? - Still there? - Will we go there? Not on the way, but I can stray. - We are very pleased. - We drive. - What is this box with numbers? - Probably the number of the car. Strange. The numbers are moving. - Vicent! - Are you sick? Do you know what it is? You have to pay so much. The amount is growing. 850 francs? Please stand. 850 francs. Without tip. Without tip? Very nice. - Far yet? - Depends. By car or on foot? - On foot. - Half-hour. - You can take the subway. - Another trip? Thank you. I remember this course in Paris. - Mr Bidache ... - I am listening? Some two to you. One is your cousin. A cousin two weeks ago. I have enough family. Some two to you. One is your cousin. Some two to you. One is your cousin. Let them come. Some two to you. One is your cousin. Some two to you. One is your cousin. - Good morning, cousin. - Where are you from? Some two to you. One is your cousin. Some two to you. One is your cousin. - We arrivedfrom Esaka. - I am Bilou, your cousin. Some two to you. One is your cousin. Some two to you. One is your cousin. - And he? - This is Vincent, my friend. Some two to you. One is your cousin. Some two to you. One is your cousin. Do you remember my mother? Some two to you. One is your cousin. Sister ... Some two to you. One is your cousin. Some two to you. One is your cousin. I wait an hour for you! Some two to you. One is your cousin. Some two to you. One is your cousin. - It's not in the sauce. - I trust in family feelings. Some two to you. One is your cousin. Some two to you. One is your cousin. Do you remember me? Last time I saw you as a child. Some two to you. One is your cousin. Again ?! A week ago, my cousin came home. Do you remember me? Last time I saw you as a child. Do you remember me? Last time I saw you as a child. When we greeted each other I peed at my pants. - But I've grown. - What do you want? - Room. - Go to the hotel. - We prefer you. - Again?! "Again"? We come for the first time. - Just a small room. - something to eat. I can only give you a job. Can you paint? - Of course. - You start at 6 am. Driving! I have matters on my mind. - Can we leave our suitcases here? - Put in the corner. It starts nicely. I will take this one. I have supplies there. - Something new? - You can not trace them. Merry. I am listening, Mr. Cartoni? No. It is not possible for it to disappear like camphor. I have called to the tavern, the mayor, to the post office. He left. You need to move the sky and the earth! Look no further! Tomorrow I am going back to Paris. - Why does it matter to you? - First, it's similar to you. Secondly, only the beginner agrees. Third, Cartoni decided so. Nothing will stop him. Mr Cartoni's secretary is very busy. He will not accept anyone. - I've been waiting for 2 hours. - I can not do anything. - Have not you heard? - We are to Mr. Cartoni. - Who arranged you? - He himself. - He's in Cannes. - I travel a lot. Excuse me, gentlemen. We have a headache. - What are you doing? - Good morning, cousin. - I asked, what are you doing? - Painting. - Others are upstairs. - I prefer to start from the bottom. No discussion. Upstairs. - I have dizziness. - You can handle ita. - And how will I drop? - And how will I break you out of the door ?! And people pay to enter here. I wanted to be high. And please. I am in control of Paris. - What's wrong with you? - My head's spinning. - Easy, it happens. - It would be better for me. Unlike Miguel, you have no reason to go to Mexico. Absurd idea substitute someone for him. - Do you have another idea? - No. I will not sing with just anyone. I found the perfect partner. - Where is he? - Disappeared. - Getting better. - I will find him, even inESAC. - Where? - Basque village. I heard him there accidentally. You were supposed to be with Martinez nearby in San Sebastian. - So it's my fault? - Of course not. Do not be angry. Think about how much you will earn from it. Remember that you seduced Martinez. - He is ready to marry you. - How will he look at these mockery? - He will never know. - May. So you agree? I will answer as soon as I see and I will hear your Miguel. Perfect. Give me three days, I will find him. - For now, Cartoni. - You are an angel. Thank you. Brilliant necklace it would facilitate interests. You can count on me. Goodbye. Pigeon. - Tomorrow are we going to Cartoni? - Do not count on it. - I am finishing with my career. - It has not started yet. Yes, I have enough. What will be later? - Do you prefer to climb the scaffolding? - Yes. We make enough money to live peacefully. As you want. It's a pity, because you sing beautifully. We know from the neighbor that it is Sunday. What am I pouring here, idiot! - Politely, a peasant. - You broke my coffee. - Parasite. - Get lost, moron. No scandal. This is the caretaker's niece. I have it somewhere! - Should I drink water from plants? - For pigs, just right. - I will give you a sour apple. - Try it, you'll get it in the face. Mrs. Cricri! Mr. Vicent. Just in time. I have just apologized to your friend. I had to go after you. To buy back invite you for breakfast. - So how? - Why not. - Something similar! - You do not understand anything and nothing. I do not stop. Please, Mr. Vincent. I serve delicious coffee with milk, toast with butter and fruit preserves. - Confiture,I stay. - Me too. I will give my share, Mr. Vincent. - No. - Yes, I will take yours. Do not be ashamed of you? I do not drink two coffees at once. - That's why I will take one. - Coffee is coming! - How fast. - I took it from my aunt. How nice. - Do it for your neighbor from below. - Eat. A moment. First, Mr. Vincent. Now me. And then you. - What kind of drink do you drink? - Little milk. - And you? - A lot of coffee, sugar, milk. All. I'm going back to Paris. Tell him to call me immediately. A fortune awaits him. My business card. - I do not say anything anymore. - Bilou is right. Finally. You can not paint buildings or rot in the countryside. He will sing once. Theater directors will fight for him. Only they must want to listen to me. It's not that difficult. Tonight Vincent will sing at the Moulin Rouge. - You? - It's a joke. - You will hear millions of people. - Will there be enough of them there? The day before yesterday selling flowers I found out that the management is organizing a gala today and competition for amateurs. - And what? - I know the manager. - You like him. - It is recommended to me. - That's what I thought. - And what's next? Ask him to write you down. Brick success. - I'm sure. - I do not. - You could thank. - I'll take care of everything. - My dear Cricri ... - I am listening. - Can you write me in too? - As a tenor or bass player? As an optimist. - Rather a trumpeter. - Shit, my aunt. Where are you? Disappear. Get an attack how he will see you. - Too late, go up the stairs. - To the wardrobe! Not here, stupid. There! Busy. Are you deaf? - I dressed myself, aunt. - Very long. - What kind of shoes? - I bought the worn one. It's too big for me. Feet? It's a man! Get out of here! Man, in her room. You have shamed your family. I think I'm going to pass out. - One more? - Good morning Lady. Good morning, thank you. Before the competition of amateurs begins I have the honor to present the group "los Mariachis Vargas". I will show them how to play the trumpet. - Stop it. - You are nervous. - I have stage fright. - Unnecessarily. - Put yourself in my place. - The glass will break. - Do not bother me. - Relax, Mr. Vincent. I have given you all. I will support you. Can not you silence this? I want to eat lobster calmly. I will ask the boss. The competition is about to start. First participant. Tenor category: Vincent Etchebar. - Vincent Etchebar ... - It's him! Thank you. And now as a soloist Mr. Bilou will perform. My inspiration ... Am I listening? I am asking you. I know. This is a difficult passage. More vibrato. I have no shortness of breath. Tonot so easy. One finger. Jealous that he can not do this with a baton. He was red with envy. Something is not playing here. Conduct, do not stare. Standing like a calf. It looks as if mixed with mayonnaise. - They did not understand. - After "los mariachis", no wonder. They have tormented them. - Mr. Vincent Etchebar? - It's me. - Telephone to master. - Where? - In the corridor. - Fly. I am listening? Yes, sir. Yes ... That's great. - Speak. - Guess. Do not play with us. Cartoni wants to see me tomorrow. Fantastic! Let me kiss you! Let's celebrate the three of us! Get in the way! Speak boldly. Good morning, Mr Cartoni. I am glad that you noticed me. My friend Vincent is happy with the role he has received. We put a lot of respect ... No, no, no. Not at all! If you say something like this and you, Bilou ... no he will be charmed. - Should we impress him? - It is obvious. - How are we to go? - You have to aim at art. I've remembered all the American films I've watched. I will play tricks. Consent? - Sure. - So we repeat. - You leave ... - As you like. - Stand. - We had to leave. I recall the role. I am Mr. Cartoni. Knock on the door. I answer: "enter". - It's easy now. - Now we? - I will explain what's next. - Excellently. When you hear "enter", you enter. - We are not deaf. - You go with ostentation. - With whom? - Demonstration, pretentious. As if you were important. - What's up? - Important. - Stupid. - Next? Instead of timidly welcoming just sitting down putting your feet on the table. - And throws us out the door. - For lack of upbringing. Where from! He regards you as important business partners. Suggests a box thick cigars. We take one. You break the tip with your teeth. You spit it out as far as possible. You light and burn smoking in Cartoni's face. The cigar harms me. - You have to do what I say. - Eternally unhappy. Then you allow him to speak and reject any offer. - Why go? - Faster, we will be late. 429 ​​ 00: 50: 15,960 -> 00: 50: 18,320 The better. - Are we going in three? - Of course. I will make sure you do not get swollen. - Enter. - Mr Vincent Etchebar. Let it go. - Hello Cartoni. - My agent and secretary. Personal. I do not have to ask you to sit down. - As you can see. - Unnecessary efforts. Maybe a cigar? I need a cigarette. - Let's talk. - What is going on? It's about a deal for Mexico. - I refuse. - Why? - We do not agree to anything. - Goodbye, Mr. Cartoni. - I am calling you freedom. - And I have a cigar. Please listen to my suggestion at least. Provided you also hire Miss Cricri and Bilou. - I do not need them. - I do. It's some madness. - So let's go. - You will regret it. - Goodbye. - Please wait a moment. Is it you, dear Evo? I found him. Is in my office. Not exactly. We have not discussed the details yet. I will bring him to the theater in the evening. You will be surprised by his beautiful, strong voice. I understand, at 6. See you. Great Eva Marshall called. Your partner in the operetta "Singer in Mexico" Three weeks of work in Mexico. Let us discuss the conditions. But you must change your name. Why? Vincent Etchebar does not say anything on the poster. Nickname needed. I guessed it. Some catchy name ... Miguel Morano, what do you say? - How does my secretary think? - Fits. Miguel Morano as the Singer withMexico. I Eva Marshall, his thrilling partner. We did not ask about your opinion. - What's going on? - From Mr. Cartoni. - We have an appointment with Eva Marshall. - You too? - She does not interest me. - Do you want to see her or not? - We want. - Forward that a new partner is waiting for her. I will anticipate her. - Caprices of stars ... - What's wrong with you? - Are you okay? - Yes. What is this face? Tell. - Are we talking to you? - Do not you like it? - On the contrary. - I like when you smile. - Really? - Of course. You and Bilou are my best buddies. I understand. There it is. - Are you the master? - I? And Mrs? - Eva Marshall. - I'm very pleased. - Cartoni sent you? - Yes. - I'd better call him. - Everything has already been agreed. I know ... Surely you sing beautifully ... - What are you playing with? - Because I rather screech. But I play great on the trumpet. If it's a joke, it's in bad taste. - I'm sorry, I'm late. - Are you jeering?

Shit, this is the second one. What are you doing here? - I am also wondering. - Get him back. What's going on? Help! - Help! - What happened? - What do you say? - Abducted ... Gangsters ... Do not bother. I understand. You do not understand anything. It is unbelievable. Attention! A band of cowards! So you work like that ?! I'm sending you to a sour apple! - He is in Acapulco. - Really? Excellently. - Is that you? - Do you listen at the door? Not nice. Interrupting in listening is more uncomfortable. - You follow me like a shadow. - I like staying with you. - It annoys me. - Me or Eva? - Why she? - It occurred to me. I'm still stuck with eyes and grins at Vincent. - What's up with this? - Nothing, but it annoys me! When is he pissed off for me? - Cricri ... - Give me a break. See. Stupid. Not enough to not understand certain things. - I want to talk. - About what? About you. I have been watching you for a long time. You became interested in Vincent and started to flirt with him. - I had different ideas. - You? I wanted to throw it away behind the door. - I gave you a hard bone. - I'm used to. - I understood. - What? You are nervous by Vincent. - He is crazy. - Admit it. Yes. But do not tell him about it. I promise. I will try how I can. I am not your father. - Do you love him? - I do not know. This is something new for me. I thought I would never get married. Suddenly everything came to a head. Maybe it's love. May not. When you hold his hand ... Do not cry. I'll give you some advice. We are in Acapulco. Change tactics. - Meaning? - Use your beauty. - How? - Nothing hard. I'll help you. I will not let you suffer. My little Cricri. Have you heard? My. Let me kiss you! - Hooray, Cricri. - Are you already? I have seen everything. My congratulations. Do not be so humble. Has allthe advantages to make you happy. Why were you trying to be so attractive? I have disturbed you. It's nothing scary. You are wonderful. I think I loved you. Please be polite. We are not alone. - Are you hiding us? - No, but ... - Are you okay? - Yes. Good morning. - Are you sitting here? - As you can see. - Do not watch the show? - What? Funny masquerade. Bilou dances with your personal secretary. - You should see it. - I saw something else. With this pair of binoculars everything can be seen from a distance. For example? Eva Marschal, who seduces like a professional coquette. - I made a mistake about you. - For services, my dear. - I do not like this tone. - And when I mock me. End of this comedy. Time to leave the curtain. - I was about to say that. - I am glad that I lasted you. Who is he for? - The storm is in the air. - I think so too. What bit her? - No! - What makes you laugh? Let me see you. Get up, turn around. Who told you to put it on? - I bet it's you. - Of course. - Show yet. - Leave me. - What happened to her? - You must be blind. - What? - Nothing. - I promised her I would not say anything. - Who? - Cricri! - What did you promise her? - That I will not repeat what she told me. - What did she tell you? - That he loves you. - Me? Do you think I danced for pleasure? Yes. In that case it bounced you. We will leave early in the morning, to avoid the heat. Good. Cartoni, do not make it public. I will go alone with Mr Martinez. Do not interrupt. I'm not saying anything. - And Miguel? - Mr Morano is only a scenic partner. - It's not my type. - I'm glad to hear. You say it by politeness. Easy, Cartoni will do the job. Truth? Not the first time. - Who is there? - It's me, Bilou. - Can I enter? - I do not want to see anyone. - Even a Bliou buddy? - Even. - Are you mad at me? - You know that it is not. - So? - I am undressed. - Do not overdo it. - Listen? Put on something. I have to talk to you. Okay, wait a minute. When it comes to Vincent, you can leave immediately. - Do not bother. - I am not going to. Enter. Is that you? - I am in a matter. - What? I am sorry for what happened. I did not mean to offend you. - I do not mind you. - All the better. You share my opinion. You do not like it either. You are right. You look so beautiful. - Like a wild flower. - Do not you prefer Miss Eva? Never talk about it. - Why? - This is only a stage partner. - Something new. - You do not believe? - So what? - Nothing. Absolutely nothing. 20 pesos. You will get twice as much as you bring him before dawn. He can not get hurt. - You will notice differently. - Sure. Good morning. - Cartoni, we will see each other in Mexico. - Have a nice journey. Get up! Vincent! Help! This kidnapping! Cricri, where are you ?! Vincent has been kidnapped as I have recently. - What Vincent? - Senor Morano! - Speak more clearly. - Room in disarray, he disappeared. - They kidnapped him? - Exactly! - Who? Why? - Good question. I know who. Bandits sucked by a beautiful woman. - What woman? - Terrible, armed. Daughter of Zorro. - Did you fall on your head? - I think I know who it is. - Who? - I have to remember something. - What is it? - Female name for 3 syllables ... - No time for crosswords. - I already know. - Speak! - Tornadoes! - I know her perfectly. - See? - What is this one? - Do not you know? - I know it only from the photo. - Well? - We want to know. - Terrible owner of a ranch in the desert. Treats animals with whips, people with a revolver. - What does she want? - Long story, then explain. - I am calling the police. - Excluded! Come on. Vincent is not Miguel. If it happens ... I understand. But we can not sacrifice it for this tiger. Stay as you are afraid. I'm going. By what right have you kidnapped me? - Who told you? - I. But you know. I also do not know your name and where I am. Really? I thought you would never forget me. - Is it a ransom? - I want you to keep your promise. - It was better not to return to Mexico. - I'm here for the first time. From the time you quit. I swear ... It's a mistake. - This is not me. - You have changed for 5 years. Fits your hairstyle. I prefer you without a mustache. - Listen ... - You will fail the second time. Are you refusing? The worse for you. I am ready for anything. Do you know what does it mean. Do what you want. If you do not understand anything, I will not answer you. As you wish. Take him. Why did you bring me to the chapel? - Reply! What are we waiting for? - For a priest. Here is the man whom I spoke to my father. Are you mad? I will not get married under duress. - Likethis? Explain. - There is nothing to explain. - He promised. - Not true. You are lying. Do not let your father listen to him and do whatever he needs. I will do nothing before I hear it. - How will we enter? - Through these small doors. - And how are they closed? - We will climb the ladder wall. Come in, I'll wait. - What happened ?! - I'm afraid. Stupid. - Who is the first to enter? - Let's try first through the door. We can pull straws. Open. If it goes well, follow me. Sure? - I can not hear anything. - All right. - Please. - No, go first. - First you gentleman. - I would not dare. Very nice gentleman. Are you scared? It's starting again. I said everything I know. - Please believe me. - He lies. He is at my grace. Think about it. He spoke honestly. Even if you are lying your revenge is not good. I did not ask for advice. Please, last time. The Lord is everywhere and rules the whole world. What's happening? - Cricri! - Vincent! Release it. Who are you? - And you? - I am Tornadoes. - And I Bilou. - I can flog you. Are you kidding? - What does this mean? - Get out of here! - Miguel belongs to me. - Do you think so? - This is not me. - Treat yourself. - I will scratch your eyes! - I will tear her tongue out. - I refuse. - There is a father with me. I'm in charge here! - I will scratch your eyes! - I will tear her tongue out. - I will scratch your eyes! - I will tear her tongue out. Only free yourself. See you soon! I'll explain. I am responsible for everything. Release it. - Are you someone? - Impresario Miguel Morano. I swear it's not him. His name is Vincent Etchebar. I hired him because it is very similar to Miguel. Fear refused to go to Mexico. - He knew you would take revenge. - I understand. Vincent would marry this adventurist? - Do you believe me? - I do not know. - Should I call Miguel? - No! - Disassemble. - It is not time for a striptease. Enough! Miguel has a scar on the cage. I stabbed him with a knife. Release the shirt. You're right. It's not him. I am sorry. I laughed. Get out! What an adventure. What bounced you? Why did you come here? No reason. - Everything will be fine. - I hope. But the heat. - May I be next? - For what? I will pray for happiness Cricri and Vincent. - Likes their master. - Sure. - I hurt them. - Please, do not think about it. You are not wine. You are not a bad person. Very nice gentleman. Not exactly. In my neighborhood there is a chapel with a wooden statue of Madonna. We understood each other very well. As a child when I was going on truancy I asked her for permission. Once I wanted to smuggle something I asked her to direct the customs officers the other way round. I'm sorry. - How would she smile at us? - Truth. - Do you hear what he says? - No. Yes, yes. I understand her although she speaks to Mexicans. - What is it? - That Cricri and Vincent are happy. - Bless their love. - What else? Miguel will come back one day and you'll be happy too. - This will never happen. - Of course. You love him. And I will make it clear to him. - Thank you. - Then thank her for it. Did not you tell anything? Can not deal with all simultaneously. Next time ... Why do not you tell me what do you think? I have the right not to make stupid feelings. I mean I'm stupid too. The only person I think about ... - It's you. - Impossible. - You are a star. - Yes, I need a partner. - Also for life. - I? Thanks to you I owe my success. And I won. Hooray, children. Very moving. You will not leave me? We play in Mexico in two days.
