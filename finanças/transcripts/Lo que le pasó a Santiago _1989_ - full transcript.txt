And it's these young people those that will propel from generation to generation our values ​​and the spirit of family that makes up our society. Bonanza congratulates Jacobo Morales for his work and to him we say that we admire him for its congruence. We also congratulate Puerto Rico's foundation for the commendable management of working for the good of our youth. Young Puerto Rican: In Bonanza, we go to you. My process of developing the arguments of my movie, does not follow a fixed pattern. Sometimes I think of the central theme first, or some situation. In the case of "What happened to Santiago", I visualized the protagonist first, Santiago. Elderly man, widower with family problems overwhelmed by the rampant materialism in which we live today. Following the experience of having directed Tommy Muñiz in a play I thought Tommy was the ideal interpreter for that character. It was then. That I started to build a plot around Santiago. To write the screenplay knowing beforehand who will be the main character is a big advantage. It allows me to take into account the performance style of the interpreter, his way of saying, of reacting. Between Gladys Rodriguez, who characterized Angelina and Tommy Muñiz there was a magnificent scenic relationship, the same as among the other members of the cast, this partly because we were all friends and in some cases, family. For example: The one who played Tommy's grandson was his real grandson: Pedrito Muñiz, who in turn is the son of Pedro Muñiz who was the producer. My brother Javier represented himself as a doctor and Blanca Silvia, my wife, was the executive producer. "What happened to Santiago" was for everyone a great experience that culminated with the nomination to an Oscar award in 1990 as best movie in a foreign language. [Restaurant conversations in the background] What happened to Santiago [background conversations continue] [Thank you, thank you] Santiago: Time it left you with the presidency and the millions, but you're still the same spoiled brat that I helped to cross the street. [Dad could stand him, but I do not have to put up with it] You are obliged to be here, you never supported me because of my efficiency. You may not support yourself either, for being such a wimp. [it has been improving a lot] You have been good, Fito, too much of a conformist, but good; But do not give yourself illusions, when you reach 65 the same lunch awaits you, the gifts, a pension of 2 or 300 pesos and retirement. And you Santiago. What have you ever done? Let Santiago speak! [Speak! Speak!] [toast, a toast] [a toast, a toast] I have been, what you have seen a man of numbers, of system, of method; A common man. A man who has always believed that everything would be better if people lived and let others live. I started with Don Gonzalo back there, by 1942. Don Gonzalo, he was a person who thought that people were the companies' best investment. How times have changed! Well, you must imagine what is going through my mind and what my feelings are towards you? I want to make a toast, for the experiences that have allowed me to know all of you, as you are and remember you as you deserve. Well, that's reality Santiago, your 65 years, the retirement. But the idea of ​ your children also arises, your grandchildren, life. There are so many things you can do. [when he's available tell him to communicate with Luna-0-11 or with police ...] [We did what had to be done, you are the ones at fault] [you are the ones at fault, you are] [you are the one, you're the one... you're the one who spins it, you're ...] [you are, you are, you are, you are, you are the ones at fault ...] [voices in the distance speaking on the radio] Fuck! Are you still there? Come here, come here. Come here, little kitten, this little kitten is good, let's go, out. I ask too little out of life, just a quiet old age, with you, in the field and to die before you, you are more organized, more practical you can carry on alone, better than me I am one of those who get sad in the afternoons, of those who cry at dawn at the thought that a loved one may be gone. You married an idiot! If at least I could have bought you that little house in the country. Yes I think so... Hello. Did I wake you up? No, no, no, no, what's wrong? Look, I won't be able to go to the cemetery in the morning. Any problem? No, the thing is that I have an appointment first thing in the office and... well I thought maybe we could go at about 12 12 o'clock is not the time to go to the cemetery! Daddy, the cemeteries do not close at noon. Could we go at about half past four? I will go at 9 in the morning. Well, do whatever you want. And the kid? He's better. Did you take him to the doctor? I'll do it today. Weren't you supposed to do it yesterday? I couldn't! You should have told me and I would have taken him. Daddy, I know perfectly what I should do and when I should do it. In other words, you mean to say that I should mind my own business. Look, I don't feel like arguing with you, much less at this time of the morning I'm tired of bratty behaviors, of the lack of responsibility of whomever, almost my entire life and there's Mrs. Soyla with that damned bitch as small as she is, she shits a ton. Ah but the next time she leaves a turd in the grass I'm going to pick it up with a shovel and I'm going to throw it back at her balcony. Hello? It's me, again. What is the matter now? Look, you didn't let me ask you what were you going to do tonight? Something very important. Watch television until 10:30 if I don't fall asleep before the news. Well, better for you to come and eat over here. No thanks, I don't like to arrive at night. Well, I'll pick you up and then I'll take you. No, that's too much trouble. Daddy, it's troublesome that we never agree. Okay I'll pick you up at 7. On the dot, OK? Yes Daddy, on the dot, on the dot. God bless you darling! She is like that. Sorry to be a little late, it's because of the traffic, the city the usual problems, that every day are getting worse. You don't know how tired I feel, it gives me a lot of work... the routine and the loneliness. I'd like to return to the country, spend there the days that I have left. I dream a lot of those times and with you. When I wake up, I keep you in my mind for a long time. Eddie is still my biggest concern, his improvement is slow. Now, he just talks about the Lord. Let's repeat! Positions! Those people have to go! Silence! Ready to roll! Silence, I said! Positions! Sound! Scene 2, take 31. Action! Cut! What is that Lady doing there? Madam please, we are filming. Get out! How many times do I have to repeat it? Calm that horse down! Positions! Silence! Silence, I said! These people have to go! Ready to roll! Do you mind? And what are they doing? [Action!] I think it's a movie. The horse is beautiful. Yes, but the director is horrible. He doesn't realize, that his screaming is what is making the horse nervous. Are they going to be here all afternoon? From what I see... [Silence!] [Let's repeat!] There are also some problems at the Princesa Park, a man in boots is up on a pole. And what is the problem? That he's naked, if no one would paid attention to him, there would be no problems, but people look at him and that bothers him. There is not even one place left where one can be calm. Do you often come here? Sometimes. I like to go to the little square on the docks, but today it is full of tourists. Do you like to travel? I like the field I like the sea. It's in my blood because Dad was a ship's captain. And he insisted on painting landscapes instead of portraying them. Today is a very beautiful day! [Over there they have a beautiful place to make an exhibition, right?] Look at the one with the field! This one has the beach, can you see? That looks like Joyuda. Are you the author of that? [Yes] Good coffee! Really delicious! There was a time when the coffee served in the Vatican was Puerto Rican. Even for coffee there were better times, it seems. Are you one of those who think that all past time was better? Well... it could be. Perhaps it is that over the years the enthusiasm is lost and the negative things, stand out more. When did you start feeling old? Eh... I'll tell you. It was once that I was traveling, and my wife, may she rest in peace, instead of saying "behave yourself", she told me: "Take care of yourself." Will there be anything more pleasant than the sound of a piano at sunset? As long as they play it well. That must be a 14 year old girl playing, she has braids, a cotton suit, a gold ring on her ring finger, and white shoes. Her father will arrive at 6 and the whole family will have dinner together. Are you always like this? Like this, how? So, nice, uh, different, original. Do I look like that to you? That's what you have shown me. Do you like to read? Yes, sometimes. And what is your preferred genre? I read about agriculture, horses, and obituaries. A ship is like a goodbye with little windows, It's a shame that people no longer say goodbye with handkerchiefs. Well, I have to go now. It has been a pleasure. Likewise. Can I walk you home? No, no, no need, thanks. I would like to give you this. For me? Thank you! I would like us to see each other again. Me too. When? Let's hope for a meeting by chance. Eh... excuse me. My name is Santiago Rodriquez. That name is easy to remember. I'm coming, I'm coming. Why wouldn't she tell me her name? Well, simply because she does not want us to see each other again. But your name is something you tell anyone. Maybe it's not convenient for her to say her name. What reason could she have? Don't rush me, don't rush me. Well... anyway, today, something different happened to me. And that is enough. Later you will tell me if Amelia finds out who her real Mother is, eh? You don't have to keep hinting that I'm late. I was just looking at the clock. Oh, Daddy, I've known you for 35 years. Girl, if you know me, then, why don't you try to be a little more punctual? Because I don't have a fixed closing time at the office. Because I don't have a maid, because I don't have a husband that helps me. Furthermore, one cannot live as a slave to the clock. And the kid? Gerardo promised to take him to the doctor today. What did the doctor say? When I take him home tonight, I'll know. What was it? You passed the red light. Daddy, did something happen to you? I'm alive, wait, I'm alive. He is the most disorganized child in the world! Yes, and the one with the most toys. Are you sure you're okay? I have not claimed, anything! Come on, come, sit here. Wait, this... wait, wait, wait, there seems to be something here. Let's see... Oh yeah, you have a bruise over there, hold on I'm going to leave those toys there, to force him to pick them up. So that your husband slips and breaks his jaw? Ah, nothing ever happens to him, - Even if he feels something, he won't suffer. - Lucky him. Yes, lucky him, better he takes advantage of it as long as his luck lasts. Do you think court, lawyers, and divorce is lucky for him? Oh Daddy, I prefer not to talk about that, especially at a time like this. It's about your marriage that we're talking about. Currently I'm no longer married! I mean, psychologically, I'm not married anymore. It would be better for you to stop thinking about your psychologies, and start thinking about your son. I have everything very well thought out, analyzed and decided. I know you never liked my advice, but as a father, the least I can do... Oh Daddy, please, do you want to talk to me about something else? Where did you buy that tie? No, no, I'm not kidding. I really liked doing that, the thing is that your mom wouldn't let me. Well, today, you are the guest. Do you want a drink? Do you have white rum? I'm considering an offer from the company. They offered me a promotion. Nice, that's great! But I'm going to have to go 6 months to New York, to take training in NYU, and the company pays for everything. Great but... What about the kid? Gerardo would stay with him. Gerardo? Gerardo can't do that, Gerardo travels a lot. There is also that lady who takes care of him, you know that she is trustworthy. And besides them I have you, I mean, if you can. For me it's never been too much of a hassle or problem, to take care of my family. To peace! To health! And Eddie? Well, Eddie, I don't know, no, no... I'm not very happy with the treatment they are giving him, in that hospital. Oh Daddy, don't you think it's time we accept Eddie is not going to get better? How do you think I can accept something like that, girl? You have to accept reality. You know they didn't give you much hope in the United States. Yes, yes, but that means losing faith, and I can't lose faith. No. What you are going to lose are the little savings that you have left, Daddy, think about the fortune that you've spent on Eddie in the last 10 years. Nereida, how much is your son worth? Daddy, let's assume that Eddie can't recover, that he can't manage to provide for himself anymore, With what will you maintain him? I mean, I'm also here, but you know how things are, Today you have a job and tomorrow you don't. And if you don't have a good economic base, you have no security. I have the insurance policy, I'm looking for a job. Where Daddy? It was about time. I decided to wait for the analyzes. My Gere! My grandson, so cute! How are you doing Santiago? Well, a bit gimpy, but improving. What happened was that he tripped over the toys, that this young man had left lying there. Gerardo Santiago, the very first thing you're going to pick up now are the toys. I'll pick them up later... You are going to pick them up, Now! Where are you going? To find a box to put them in. What did he say... the doctor? Well, he found him a little under weight, low hemoglobin, he has some... complications, in fact here are the prescriptions. Really? You should have brought the medicines. They were waiting for me in a meeting. Well, see you later, Don Santiago. Later. God bless you, Jerry! Later! You and I have something to discuss. I know. Well let's solve it. Sure, let's wait for the weekend and we'll talk. No more excuses, OK? Aha. It's delicious! I can't offer you more because it was the last one left. And the kid? Do you also have him on a diet? On a diet? I mean... eating those things that you eat. If what you mean to say is, if I have him eating healthy foods? Well yes, any objection? No, no... relax girl, none. What really matters is that he eats. And right now we don't know if he has eaten something or not. At least I'm not aware. Gerardo and I were in accord, that after he took him to the doctor. He would take him to have something to eat. He didn't tell me otherwise, so I assume he took him to have lunch. If he ate a lot or if he ate a little, I don't know. But anyway, before he goes to bed, I'll give him a piece of carrot cake and a glass of milk. Anything else? Can I take him out, on Saturday? I guess so. Do me a favor and get me a taxi. But we agreed that I was going to take you home. Get me a taxi! Why should I have to fight so much with Nereida? Why can't I learn to tolerate her? [Can you send a taxi? To this address...] The baby will be born in September, by that time it is likely that George is going to be relocated to Texas. So it's possible that you will have a cowboy grandchild. If George is promoted to captain before the end of the year, we will go to spend the Christmas holidays in Puerto Rico. Tell Eddie to write me, I have sent him some T-shirts, some pants, some stockings, some tennis shoes, and some books that I'm sure he'll like a lot. [freeze!...] [... He's got no more bullets... throw it away! Throw it!] Praise God, in his sanctuary. Praise him in the magnificence of his firmament. Praise him for his prowess, Praise him according to his excellent greatness. Praise him with psaltery and harp. Praise him with tambourine and dance. Praise him with strings and flutes, Praise him with resonant cymbals. Praise him with jubilant cymbals. Everything that breathes... praise the Lord. Hallelujah. My name is Angelina. I had already lost hope that we would see each other again. Or rather, that... I thought it would take longer to see us. I went to the dock, I went to the park... To the mail. Whose was that letter? I mean, if I'm not indiscreet. From my daughter and... Where were you? What do you say if you start addressing me informally? Ladies first. As you wish, Santiago. I heard that there was a shooting. Yes, I saw a part. Did they kill someone? No, but they did hurt a young man. Eh... And you, where were you? I mean, eh... Where were you, when I was reading the letter? I was strolling around in a balloon, I stroll around in balloons every morning... You don't believe me? Everything is possible. I was on the trolley. And you had intentions of ...? Yes. No, forget it. My main problem is that I can't forget anything. did you intend, for us to see each other today? What do you think? I don't know. You were never good with women, right? Then that poor man, green with dizziness had to confess that he was not even a cabin boy... and the medal was from his grandfather... My dad was dying with laughter, but he was also sorry for the poor man. Oh, it's been a while since I laughed so much. They say that laughter is very good for your health. Not always, I know a lady who died of laughter. But that she really died... Oh, well, I shouldn't laugh at that, not one more. Well, if I had to die, I would die of laughter. Well I would like to die of... the truth is that I don't want to die. And it's not exactly because of fear, but because, I'm in love with life. It can be said, and rightly so, horrible things about the world, but life... life is so beautiful. There are so many moments that it gives us, to enjoy. I want to eat spaghetti, with meat sauce, cheese... and garlic bread. The senses... allow us to enjoy, from spaghetti, to a sunset. From a Morel dance... to the smell of jasmine. From a downpour... to love. How is New York, grandfather? Big... Nice? It has some beautiful parts... He told me that I could spend Christmas' holidays with her. That would be a good experience for you. What is snow like grandpa? Snow?... Have you seen the snow? The only snow, that I have seen, is the one they brought by plane, from New York, to Puerto Rico, many years ago. And when the elevator stopped, that Lady, started to scream like crazy. You didn't get scared? Me? No. I would have been scared. I knew they weren't going to take me out. [...don't start with that story] [... It's not a story, I'll give you more money] [Well, I'm sorry, but I can't take care of that car's bill] [but the bill is in your name ...] [Because you wanted it that way, for the income tax] [Look, during these 6 months, ] [the one to take care of all the expenses of the kid, it's going to be me] [And who took care of the camp's bill last summer?] [... Don't force me to add up the bills, because the one to lose will be you] [... Aha?, look you add whatever ...] You think that...? How about if we go and buy 2 more wafers? [... Nothing that I had to miss, starting with... not even ...] Well seems that this is around here... Santiago, how are you? How are you? What are you doing here? I am looking for an address, but I don't know... nor clear where it is. Let's have a coffee... No thanks, I appreciate it but it's just... I'm in a hurry. Alright... Well, greetings to the family... Goodbye. Goodbye... everyone around here is in a rush... Excuse me, I'm looking for an address, there in the next... Ah, sure, over there, upstairs it's on the 7th floor. Thank you. Anytime. Pleasure to meet you Mr. Rodriguez, come in, come in. Dad had to leave on a last-minute business trip but, well, he asked me to take care of you and, will it take him long to return? A couple of weeks. Oh please, sit down. Don Ramón and I have been friends for a long time. Yes, yes, that's what he told me. Eh, I gave him consultant services, when he had that export business. Yes, that was a while ago. How can I help you? I'd rather wait for your dad to come back. Well, let me tell you that now, I take care of all his affairs, except in the case that it was something, strictly personal. Well the thing is that, I now have more free time and I wanted to offer you my services. I am an accountant, with of a lot of experience. For 40 years I was... In that case, you can give your resume to my secretary and she will give you an application form. Any other information? No, none. Thank you very much, Julio. It has been a pleasure to have you here. Likewise. Alright. See you, Mr. Rodriguez. [... Things like you ...] Nice place. Nice music. [... Are to be worshiped ...] [... Because you and the things that look like you ...] [... Being with you I forget, about everything and myself ...] [... It feels that I have everything by having you ...] [... And I don't feel that sickness that overwhelms me ...] [... Ruining this life that I lead, I cannot live ...] Excuse me, I quite clearly specified vegetarian food when booking. Yes, but nothing shows up here. Well, someone made a mistake, and it wasn't me. Well, anyway we'll still try to please you. No, it's not a matter of trying. But of being assured of one thing or another. Well, please stay here, and we will inform you in a few minutes. I hope that Gerardo will not cause me another problem now. Something wrong? He promised to come to the airport and take care of the kid. I can take him. Not if the kid has his clothes back at Gerardo's house. But that can be fixed. What I can't stand is a change of plans at the last minute. If you can't leave today, you leave tomorrow. [Last call for passengers on flight 963, bound for San Martin, boarding door 37] Well, my love, may everything go well for you. Take good care of yourselves, huh. You have everything with you? Yes, yes, everything. If you ever need some money... I would call Rockefeller, don't worry. Well, I'll call you tonight, eh. OK? Look, we're going to spend the Christmas holidays together, you know? And it's not more than 3 months. You have to promise me that you're going to be good, You're going to eat a lot, and you're going to obey your daddy, huh? Oh no, no, come on, come on, look... We have to be very brave, I'm going to call very often, and we're going to write each other, eh? And Grandpa, will take you to fly some kites and go on horseback on Saturday, We are going to have a great time. God bless you, my son. [... For your convenience, we will be boarding by line number, starting ...] Bless you... [and boarding pass when boarding, we want to remind you that smoking is not allowed] Remember that on Saturday, we will go to fly some kites, I promise. Oh no, the plane already left. Yes, it's gone. I was trapped in a traffic jam, and I ran late. How are you doing, kiddo, how are you? Well anyway, let's go. Yeah, so, how are you doing? Everything all right? If she insists for our meetings to remain casual... It's inevitable that there will be days when... we will not see each other. Especially now, that I am working 3 days a week. And I have to spend more time with Jerry. It's possible that tomorrow I can't see her either. The cashiers finish by 6. No! I cannot allow Angelina to become a problem. If I can see her... great and if not... great too. [... Super 7 I present: Noticapsulas with Boris Torres ...] [... Announced today an indefinite contract for the outstanding journalist ...] Hello? Hi. Who? It's me. It took so long to call you. Too many Santiago Rodriguez in the phone book. Eh... I can't go to San Juan today... You don't have to give me any explanation. Well but at least... Let me explain some problems I've had, right? I've thought a lot about you. Hello? I'm here... In your house? Yes. Eh... I'll need to have your phone number. I mean, you can't suggest that I also find it by chance. Can we meet tomorrow somewhere agreed? Tomorrow? Or next week, or in 5 years... Eh... Could it be the day after tomorrow? Very good. Where?

I'm already getting you the oven in case you want to continue with the ceramics. Eddie, what about your guitar? Eddie? Where is your guitar? I gave it away! How could you do that Eddie? How could you do that? That's not... That was a good guitar. Look Eddie... let's make things clear from now on, My economic situation is not the same as before, so I'm going to need your help, your cooperation, to be able to live, in the place we can live, the way we can live, but with your help. And discipline and effort... That! That's going to be your therapy! So let's start from right now, Come on! Help me pack the suitcase. We could also weed the yard, make a vegetable patch. Do you remember the one we had when you were little? Yeah... Oh, and your mom, may she rest in peace, she had green fingers. Everything grew as it should by her hand... heh, starting with kids. Hey daddy... And that painting? Which one? This one, the one with the landscape. Oh, that one, it was a gift. And what is that? It is what you see. But you're dressed as a guard... security guard. Look, I come back at 6:30, there in the fridge you can find food. And here in the closet, at the top are the plates and at the bottom are the forks, the knives, whatever you need. OK? Put your hat on. Eh... Did you listen to me? Yes... OK, ah, and I'm going to ask you for a favor, Eh... stay here this afternoon, if you could do me that favor while I return... Sure, I'll stay here. OK, well, God bless you my son. Amen, may the Lord be with you. The truth is that the bus didn't stop, only the nineteen eighty, and I managed to grab on, for the first time in many years, I got to grab the bus. I know that luck will start blowing in our favor, even for a little while. Luck doesn't exist Daddy. Everything happens by the will of the Lord. Yes, yes, I know that things are like that. Hey! You know, I see you like... happier these days, I don't know like... full of life. What is the cause of that? The will of the Lord. Oh. It's also that... many good things have happened to me, I got a job, we're together. I don't know, I have the impression that everything will be fine. Faith moves mountains. One thing... I think you should start to see other people. Eh... whatever happened to... that girl, the one with the light hair, brown ah Beatriz. That one. She went to see me 2 or 3 times to the hospital. In fact, I think it was there that you met her, right? Yes, yes, I thought she was a good girl. Yes, yes she is... And... I think... you should call her. That is something that helps a lot, a good relationship full of affection to fall in love. Who gave you that picture? A girl friend. Try this... Goodnight. Hello! You are always so punctual, eh? For an occasion as special as this... Follow me! Where? We have to get to a place before dawn. Look, I can barely see. Are we there? Aha. I've been here before... My home. I wanted you to see my home at dawn. My first memory is of a sunrise. Papa was returning from one of his trips and I was waiting for him on the balcony. He showed me a shiny object in his hand, It was a luminous starfish, found in the southern seas. Still works. I'm going to prepare breakfast. This house was built by my grandfather. The last officer to fight for Spain in Puerto Rico, He fell in Guanica, In a shootout against the troops of General Miles. He was tall... with blue eyes, gray beard, and with a smile... irresistible. Look, in my family... There haven't been any famous people. My dad, He was a small farmer, who emigrated when the big depression happened. My Mom was dedicated to raise us. An uncle of mine was a candidate to be a representative for the Republicans, he got 11 votes. And my great aunt... Yes, she was... She had a marble stand and she also sold clandestine rum when prohibition was on. Well, she was the one that lent my dad money for, for the bus tickets. And, well, there's me... accountant for 40 years, retired. Widower, with 3 children, and now with you. [... Oh, holy god ...] I, I... I better drip... I better drip outside so as not to get the house dirty... Don't worry, get in that room, in the closet there's a bathrobe Closet? It seems that it'll continue to rain. If it rains because of me, then I hope it doesn't clear up. How you feel? Me? Better than ever. Do you want me to get you a lemon tea? No. You stay still where you are. This seems like a dream. And the small sailboat that I gave you? It's in my room... Do you want to see it? Come with me. You didn't dry your head well. Sit down. Sorry to ruffle you. Pleased? Not even a hairdresser could do better. I notice you are a little warm... uh... it must be the brandy. Do you want me to rub you with alcohol? Take off the robe. Eh? Take off the robe. In the bed would be better... If you want, I can rub you too... Still sleeping? Daydreaming... It would be better for you to keep your eyes closed... Why? Because if you open them, you'll receive a surprise. Which one? That I am a ghost. Are all ghosts like this? Like this how? Beautiful, loving... unforgettable... Unforgettable? Yes. Do you ever take off your glasses? This bread tastes like, like the one we ate when we were children. My mom... cut it into slices and put it into some little baskets like that. And then you couldn't touch it, unless you had your hands clean. If there were leftovers... You would have to kiss it before throwing it away. Since then... eh, the bread, I have thought of it as something sacred. I love you... Oh, you didn't close your car windows. It's all wet inside... Aha. Do you have something to dry it? Na ah. And what are you going to do? Do you know how to return? No, I just know that I love you... a lot. Go now. I shouldn't ask you, at what time? Or where, or anything. No? The bushes, the flowers... they are identical to the ones I have seen in my dreams. Also the house is the same, even on the inside. Where the hell am I? If... The road was supposed to go straight to the road. What happened? No, no, nothing has happened. There is no problem, everything is fine. And where were you? Hey, let me get the car inside... and then I'll tell you, because it's a very long story. Boy, you had me very worried. I'm sorry... And right now I was about to call the police. Get inside, I'll get the car inside. And, the sticks that, I found when I slipped down the ravine, they were the perfect ones, to fit the tires of the car. There I found a stone that I use as lever and, I was able to get off in an instant. Yes, and now you've caught a terrible cold. Nah, with a good night's sleep I'll wake up like new. A cold doesn't knock me down, and now less than ever. And why is that? Eh, well, because now I'm better than ever. That's why. The owner of that house, is she the same one who gave you the painting? The same. I would like you to meet her, she is a very interesting person. Hey, and if you saw... that house... that farm, you would love it, that's the most beautiful thing I've ever seen in my life. All good?* All good.* blessing...* bless... * What are you doing up so early? I have to go to a place. Do you want some breakfast? Yes, want some juice? What are you going to have for breakfast? I think you're sick. You spent all night coughing, why not make the most of your day off and stay here resting, don't go out. I'm fine... I'm good. You are burning, you have a fever. This is the natural temperature of a cold, and I have a cold. It can also be a cough. I'll prepare some scrambled eggs, is that okay? That's great. Look... And where is it that you have to go? I have to do an errand. Can't I do it? No, no, no, no. Don't worry. I have to go early. I'll come back, before noon. I'll get into bed... I'll sleep until tomorrow. Aristides Esquilin. Private Investigator. But what a pleasure to see you Don Santiago. Likewise... Have a seat, sit down. Likewise... Hey, you look pretty good. Oh, I mean... that when we first met, you were a lot thinner. Eh, that is because... at that time, I had just lost my wife. There was also that problem in the office. Almost always the bad comes together, it's a law of life. By the way, uh... there were a lot of good comments about your investigation, Everyone agreed, that you did a good job. Except... the one who was an adjuvant. Hey, how are things going over there? I think that they are going well, Eh, I, I retired recently. Excuse me, do you want to have something? A cup of coffee, some brandy? No thanks but eh, if I you could put away your cigarette... Oh, sure, yes, yes. No... I don't feel very good. Thank you. It turns out that... that I come to ask for your advise, alright? In a personal... matter. It's nothing serious eh... just out of curiosity. It turns out that I met a person... a lady. With whom I have maintained a quite intimate relationship. But... every time I want to know about her family, of her past, well... she changes the subject. She only talks to me about her father, sometimes. And she hasn't even told me his name. This... it's obvious that, for some reason. She wants to hide her identity. And that is precisely what I want to know, what is the reason? Mmm, what's her name? Angelina. Angelina... Last name? Eh... she hasn't told me that either. I brought this here... maybe this... This is her. The photo is old, but Angelina is one of those people who... that, honestly, that do not change much with time. And, where did you get this picture? From her house. I went for the first time, yesterday... she lives in the countryside. It's hard to get there, that's why I... I made this map... See? See, if you can tell, it's, it's not that hard, see? That here, upon arriving at this crossroad, I don't know if it's to the left, or to the right. Does anyone live with her? No. Well, as far as I know, no. Hello? Excuse me? Mm Hm, yes, yes this is his house. Who is calling? What has happened to Daddy? Repeat eh... the name of the hospital. Please. Don Santiago has... pneumonia. That is basically his diagnosis, I just corroborated it now. But the reason he is here in intensive, is because he had a syncope, a sort of dizziness. Due to which... well, he lost consciousness temporarily. I think it's a better place to evaluate it, here in intensive, until we can find out. To see what's wrong with him. It's great that you have arrived. Does that really makes you happy? Wouldn't it be that you were dreaming? Don Santiago how do you feel? They tell me that you are feeling a little better. [...Castañer Arroyo... Yes, I recall the name of... Castañer...] Forgive me my son, that I have put you in this problem. Please daddy... How do you feel today? Frankly? Fucked up. I had never asked God for anything with as much devotion as now. Thank you. What day is today? Friday. You have to call the company, and tell them that I can't go to work. Yes, yes. I already did. And... call the kid... and tell him that I'm not going to be able to pick him up tomorrow. But you stay calm Daddy... and the... the, my "triple S" card, It's in my room's dresser. Yes, but don't worry about that now, later we worry about that. And, another thing, no... don't tell your sister that I'm sick, I don't want her to worry. Daddy, but I have to tell her, because later they will ask me to pay the bill. Well, wait until I get well, and... and then you give her the good news. Before I forget it, I promise you that the next time I get sick, I'm going to make a mess. Look... Hey? Can I read to you? Sure boy ..., it's okay... Because in such a way God loved the world... that he has given his only son. So that everyone who believes in him... Could not get lost. Remains alive forever. Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. Well, the doctor told me, that there is a possibility for him to... let him go the day after tomorrow. Yes of course, as long as he continues to respond well to the treatment. And of course, and if there is no further complication. You, you can be sure from what I am telling you, he is much better. Of course, the doctor recommended absolute rest. OK. Of course there are no towels... Hey? While you were at home, did anyone call on the phone? No. Hey, your toothbrush, did you take it? I forgot... No, it's okay, it's here, here. Hey? And your guitar? Well, now home again, and you stay still. OK, OK, but, but today I would have to go for little while... Daddy, you haven't arrived yet, and you're going to start with that? No sir, you're going to be convalescing for a week. At least. OK? Is that the home phone? I think so... Look, you have the keys, come on, open quickly... I'm coming... come on, come on, what's wrong?... all these keys are confusing to me. Give me that... Hello? Hello, Don Santiago? Eh yes. It's me, Esquilin. Aha, Esquilin... he... I already have the information. Aha, that's good, yes, if you could send it to me as soon as possible. The thing is that I usually deliver these things personally. Yes, I understand, I understand, I understand. So, if uh... Could you bring them to me? It's that I've just arrived from... from the hospital. Yes, I'll do it with pleasure, but, it would have to be a little later. Sure, whenever you can. Does tonight sounds good to you? About 9:30? Perfect. If you have some brandy ready, I'll be punctual. He, that, that... you can count on that. See you tonight. Who was it? A friend. And who did you think it was going to be? A girl friend. Naughty Santiago, you're looking like you are about to see something... I promise to tell you the truth and nothing but the truth. Do you want some juice? No, son, thank you, no. It's good for you, it has vitamin C. Sure, but later, later. Look... I managed to talk to Beatriz, that girl that you know... and we agreed to see each other. Oh nice... Yes, she is also very interested in ceramics as well. Great, great, the very first chance that I have to go out, I'll bring you the oven. I was about to tell you, why don't you wait for me to collect some money, and we'll buy it between us? Well, son, but right now you're not generating any income. That is what you believe. I've got a "part time" job. Aha? I mean, part time, but I'm getting something, right? Yes, and where? At the supermarket. Oh, gosh. Everything is in order, you have continued with your paintings... Aha. You made the most out of your time. It's great. If you make the most out of your time... you have plenty of hours left. Available now with a "look" *, Don Santiago Rodriguez Ortiz. You said that nicely. Oh, just for you to see. Hey? Ah? Where's the cat? What do I know? I haven't seen it. Hm, you're... in love again. Yes, like someone that I know around there... I left you... You see, it's back again. But now you're going to have to put up with one or two concerts at night. Much and good news. No, and there's more. There's more? Letter from Jerry, for you. Oh, nice. Dear grandfather: Since I wasn't taken to the hospital, I am writing this letter to you. I want you to get better so we can go for a stroll, I have a better time with no one than you. Daddy promised to take me Sunday over there. I want you to explain to me, what is that double pneumonia? Your grandson, Gerardo Santiago Benitez Rodriguez, a.k.a. Jerry. If there is something I admire, it's punctuality. Come on in. Over here. Come in, come in. Sit down please. Thank you. Eh, almost forgot... uh, uh, the brandy. Thank you. Alright... I'm starting to get a cold... Eh, her name is not Angelina, Her real name is... Lena (Helena). Lena María Castañer Arroyo. She was born in Ponce, in the year 1944, daughter of... Alfonso Castañer Padua. And Isabel Arroyo Forestier. People from the high society. He was a cattle rancher, breeder of fine-step horses, and man of influence. Her mother was the daughter of a well-known Yauco merchant. Lena María, was a horse riding champion at age 15... and queen of the sports club in 1961. Shortly after, she got pregnant by a Spanish boyfriend that she had. Officer in the Navy. That arrived in Puerto Rico, on the frigate "Juan Sebastian El Cano". The young man refused to return to Puerto Rico to... to assume the responsibilities of his fatherhood. And Lena Maria was sent to study to the United States. But she was not sent there to study, but to give birth. When she gave birth, a girl by the way... Her father, gave the baby up for adoption, to a married couple from New England. Shortly after, in a fine step horse competition, well, Helena Maria, shot her father, his horse, as a result of which, her father was paralyzed. The advocates Yamil Galip, and José Rafael Gelpi, managed to prove, Helena María suffered from mental problems, during the attack. Her condition was getting worse, and later she was admitted to a psychiatric hospital in Michigan, where they managed to stabilize, but not cure her. She continued to suffer from serious emotional disorders, that, are mainly manifested by altering reality, especially in relation to her past. Her mother died in '66. And her father in '70. The family went to litigation for reasons of inheritance, and an aunt, a nun, now deceased, who always showed a lot of affection for Lena, got for her the house where she currently lives, and a lifetime allowance. Eh, everything I mentioned... with more details, appears in this report. I remember reading about... about this case. You and a thousand in this country. Well, any questions? No. I think you have done a magnificent job and... in such a short period of time. I have always believed that I am an efficient man. But I'm not able to make money, so, there's something I must be doing wrong. As for your fees... No, we'll talk about that later. Well Don Santiago, it has been a pleasure. No, you don't have to walk me to the door. I have always believed that, happiness is, the ability to live with joy, although that joy, can be confused sometimes... with madness. Goodnight. What a great joy! I was sick... I was in the hospital and I did not have a way to call you. Sick? Mm, hm, with pneumonia. Oh, I thought you were traveling or something. I've so wanted to see you and... and here you are... you're beautiful. And you are thinner but you look very well. Hm, and I'm fine. Oh... Eh, and now better, of course. I have so many things to tell you. And me too but... As I arrive, I notice that... you are leaving. Well you can come with me if you wish. Sure, I mean, if I'm not a bother. I'm going to a Taino ceremonial field that opens today, it's near a cave that my dad discovered, and named "La Cueva de las Sirenas". There are some currents of underground wind, that when going through the concavities of the rocks, they produce some effects, like a siren's song. However, the cries that are heard have no explanation. I've heard them, Dad took me to visit the cave, when I was a girl, and we found fossils of fishes, can you imagine? Fossils of fishes? Inside a cave that is on top of a mountain. We could go to an view, from where you can see the 2 coasts of the island. There, yellow roses are grown, the most beautiful roses you can imagine. [Coffee!] [... A little coffee, warm ...] [...A little sugar?...] [... A little coffee, warm ...] [... In case it's not very good ...] [...Yes, yes...] What happened to Santiago.
