There was once a warrior schoolgirl known as the "Sukeban Deka.‚Äù She risked her youth to battle destiny and vanished into legend... And now... The Cabinet's Secret Service, File No. 2, Classified. Special Agent Student, a.k.a. "Sukeban Deka." Age: 18, Gender: Female Place of Birth: Tosa Member of the Cabinet's Secret Service; reports to the Dark Director. Duties: Investigation and resolution of cases precluding police intervention. Weapon of choice: Compound-metal yo-yo. Codename: Saki Asamiya * Retired, October 23, 1986. Accordingly, this record will be deleted... ...EXECUTE Hurry up! Get a move on! Hurry! I'm okay. I'm okay! 1st Unit... 2nd Unit, approach from the left... Kikuo! Hurry! Kikuo! - Hey, are you all right? - Yeah. We'd better split up. Are you crazy? If one of us gets caught, as long as the other gets away with the evidence... ...then we can save everyone. Gotcha. Kazuo... I made this... ...as a memento, just in case. If something happens to me, give it to my kid sister Megumi... Now go! Come on, Megumi, pick up! Hurry! Hurry up! Megumi! Megumi! Big Brother? Is that you? Hell... Hell Castle! They're going to Kill us all! Big Brother? What's going on? Big Brother! Big Brother, answer me! Big Brother! Big Brother! SUKEBAN DEKA Ryozan High School Hey, guess what? We're doing our homework together today! No way! That's great! Isn't it? Dear Saki, I wonder how this letter will find you? It's been several months now since the battle with the Shirasagi-ryo. It's been long enough for it all to have become a distant memory. I've just finished my prep course for studying in England, and now I'm... ...just waiting for the day I leave. If you have time, I'd like to see you... at least once before I go. I'm leaving on the 24th. Please give me a call before then. Please let O-Kyo know that I want to see her, too. From Yukino with all my heart... to you, Saki. From my sun-drenched window... ...I look down at the frozen city. Both sadness and hatred exist only beyond the glass. It's true, if the rest of the world didn't matter... These are fun, you know. Try one! I'll take this one! Here you go. Okay, thanks! What's your problem? Wait a minute! Hey, you! You! Hey, you! I'm not going to take this bus. I'm just... Gosh! I mean, really! Wait a minute! That'll be 160 yen. Let's get off at the next stop, Kazuo. Listen, you! Bumping into someone and not even excusing yourself... You really are a jerk, you know. Here! That's not mine. Of course it's yours. I'm just here to give this back to you. I had to get on this bus... ...I didn't even want to take it. Thank you. You're right, this kid definitely dropped it. What? - He's with us, see. - That's not true! - It's not mine. Keep it! - Thank you, miss! - I said it's not mine! - Kazuo... - Just take it with you, will you? - Kazuo! I just remembered who really dropped it. It was my mistake. Hey, you... Why don't you come with me? Kazuo! Shit... Who the hell are you, dammit? Get this bus moving. Stop it! Come on, you've got to stop! Stop it! Just stop it... this girl has nothing to do with it! If you don't want her to suffer... ...tell us where you hid that photo! How should I know? All I brought back was those documents. I swear. Kikuo probably has it! You're wasting your time with us! Kikuo Kato had nothing on him. You mean they got Kikuo? Did they really get Kikuo? Hold it. Prodigious... The strength of your will is truly extraordinary. I could use someone like you. I welcome the opportunity to have you work for me. Come now, pledge your loyalty to me. Cut the crap! Is that your answer? I can wait. I know you'll come to understand eventually. What's the matter? It's just that... I've never had a man's face so close to mine in my life. Sorry. That's not what I meant. I feel bad, dragging you into all this. You should... I've got my hands full studying to get into college. I'm really sorry. But you know what? You're really amazing. I've never seen anyone as tough as you. Really? Tough? That might be true. Although, it's not like I wanted to be like this. You can't imagine how badly I wanted to live the life of a normal teenager. And now, just when I thought I'd finally gotten my wish... I'll be damned if I let them Kill me now! Who are those men? What about the photo you've hidden? They're teachers at Sankou Gakuen High. The Guards of Hell. Sankou Gakuen is Hell Castle. They're going to kill everyone. They're going to kill everyone! Tell me, what Kind of place is this Sankou Gakuen? - Give me your shoe for a second. - Huh? Your shoe! Come on, let's bust out of this moldy cell. Kazuo! - Do you know how to drive? - Leave it to me! Let's go. I'm surprised you'd know a place like this. This is where I was born and raised. When I was a kid, I used to come in here all the time and I'd get yelled at. What should we do now? Is that the photo those bastards were talking about? It was in Principal Hattori's desk. I was trying to swipe whatever I could. I couldn't make out what it was, so this is the one thing I tossed. What's so special about a photo like this? Goddammit! That's no use to us... even if we went to the police, they wouldn't believe us! Please tell me... what happened at Sankou Gakuen? - What good would it do to tell you? - Two heads are better than one, right? Hell Castle is an island in Tokyo Bay, a little over a mile from the city. You can only access it by crossing the one bridge that goes there. It's a private school that's become well-known for... ...Principal Hattori's spartan education methods. Everyone lives in the dorms. The school gladly accepts delinquents... ...and rehabilitates them into straight-arrow students. Three months ago, when Kikuo and I got expelled from our own school... ...we were sent to Sankou Gakuen. At first, we thought it would be like Juvenile Hall. But the reality of this school was... What the hell was that? You run like girls! Yuri Shirai! Answer the question! Yes, ma'am, it's a WZ-63, made in Poland. A Sub-machine gun. Vro... Vro... Vro... You idiot! Goddamn you... how many times do I have to tell you? You just lost 40 points! Get in line! Come on, get a hold of yourself. Repeat the School Code! - We will become good people. - We will become good people. - We will obey the rules without fail! - We will obey the rules without fail! - We will never make our own decisions. - We will never make our own decisions. I am Principal Hattori's servant. I am Principal Hattori's servant! But why would they make students go through military training? There's a rumor going around among the students... ...that they're planning a coup d'etat. A coup d'etat? I don't know what that fricking principal has in mind... ...but a lot of us were killed during those training sessions. Everyone's gone apathetic now. They're all acting like slaves. I just can't stand it! Kazuo, would you mind if I held onto this photo? What are you going to do? I think I know someone who might be able to help us out. I thought I might never see you again. And I thought I'd never see you, either. Get in. Please! You've got to investigate Sankou Gakuen! If you don't get right on this, more students could be killed! I'm going to hang onto this photo for now, but... ...Kazuo's word alone won't be enough. - They tortured me, too! - But there's no evidence! If you want proof, you can go find it! Are you saying you don't believe me? I've been able to confirm the bus accident. The driver's been Killed. It's under investigation, but not one clue has been left behind. What about the building they dragged us into? It's owned by the Yotsuboshi Group. There's no way a dubious-looking gang could've slipped inside. But they tortured me there! Just drop it, Saki. You've resigned as a Sukeban Deka. You've found your own happiness. I wish you success in your entrance exams. All right, you've made yourself clear. Nishiwaki... This is the photo Saki brought in. Get a good look at the man in the middle. But this is... ...Tokimune Kita! I was also surprised to hear that she'd met a student who'd... ...escaped from Sankou Gakuen. It was all I could do to stop from crying out when I saw that photo. Why would Kita be at Hell Castle? Nishiwaki, what do you think of this scenario? Five years ago, attempting to stage an insurrection in the Department... ...Kita and his men were foiled in their plot, and we surrounded them. The bastard was killed in that explosion. But what if he were in fact alive? Kita is behind the Sankou Gakuen... the very school we're investigating. I'm bored! I'm bored! I'm bored! Man, this is such a bore. It is boring, isn't it? - I'm bored! - Kyoko, hurry up and finish that. O-Kyo! Saki! Saki! 0-Kyo, it's been such a long time! You didn't have to give me a heart attack! Saki! I really missed you! I really missed you... Another incident? Wouldn't have it any other way... check this out! "Marble O-Kyo" hasn't lost her touch yet! Actually, O-Kyo... Huh? I'm thinking of helping this guy escape to Shikoku. What? You mean we're not going to kick some butt? Right now, we don't stand a chance against those people. 0-Kyo, you have a lot of connections, don't you? Will you help him get on a freight train to Shikoku? Please? Well, sure I will, but... I'm not going! Kazuo! What other option do we have? What can you do against professional soldiers trained to their peak? I'm not going to run out on my buddies. I have to do whatever I can. I'm getting you on that boat if I have to drag you myself! Saki... It's only been 3 or 4 months, but... ...you've really changed, haven't you? Are you really such a wuss without your police insignia? The Saki I knew would've done whatever it took to rescue those students... ...you would've been all fired up! You don't give a crap about anybody else because your own fight is over? All I'm trying to do is keep you from getting killed. Saki... listen to me... O-Kyo... it's exactly like you said. No, I'm sorry. I didn't mean it. I guess... ...before I knew it, I'd let myself get lost in a peaceful life. Saki... Going to the movies, going shopping, studying for exams... I'd lost myself in that Kind of life and I was starting to lose my anger. The thing is, you're not like me... Deep down inside, you've got a peaceful soul. But still, there are things that can and can't be forgiven! 0-Kyo, let's do it! You and I... Let's rescue those students from Hell Castle ourselves! Yes? It's me. What's the problem? The Dark Director? It seems that our plan is under investigation. Watch your back! He created the Sukeban Deka Program, such a formidable system... I can't imagine what lengths he'd go to in order to thwart our plans. If word of our plan to stage a coup gets out, then both you and I are finished. You understand that, don't you? Only too well. Not that bastard again... The Dark Director... No matter how you look at it, we'll need soldiers. And that means... first of all, we've got to summon her, right? I told you, I have no intention of getting Yukino involved. But why not? Yukino's leaving for England on the 24th. The 24th is tomorrow. We can't do this to her at a time like this. Studying abroad? What a moron. Let's stop her from going. No. Damn. And here I thought we were going to fight side by side again. I know someone who could help. A girl from Boso Chiba. I think her name's Taiko Hirata. Taiko Hirata, huh? You know her? - Brings back memories, doesn't it? - I bet she'd be glad to come help us out. I'm going to go give her a call. Saki... What? There's someone I have to see. Sorry, we just let ourselves in... Listen, you're Megumi... Kikuo's kid sister, right? He said... ...this is for you to remember him by, in case something happened. But it's not like Kikuo is dead, all right? I promise you! I'm going to rescue him, no matter what it takes. Let me join you, too, then. - It's too dangerous for you. - Please let me help! My brother... they might Kill him, isn't that true? He's the only family I've got! I won't leave it to strangers to save him. I'll be the one to save him! All right, fine. Go get your things, then. Here they come! Saki! O-Kyo! Taiko! Saki! Taiko! Taiko! Everybody, split up! You went too far this time! I'm Sukeban Deka Ill, Yui Kazama! I'll make you pay! You dirty scumbags! Who the hell are you? I'm Sukeban Deka lll... That's really low! Come down from there and fight fair and square! - You moron! - Cowards! Don't have the guts to come down here, do you? - Are you really the 3rd Sukeban Deka? - That's right. You've got to hang on! - Taiko! - Taiko! Watch out! Kazuo! Kazuo! Take that! Damn you! Stop right now! Dammit! Stop the helicopter! In my bag... there's a yo-yo in there. Nishiwaki asked me to give it to you. You won't get away with this. Hell Castle... I swear I'm going to make you pay! Miss Yukino... O-Kyo! Saki needs your help. You've got to help us. Get in, please. Miyamoto? I'm not going to England. Miss Yukino! First of all, I'd like to give you my report on Sankou Gakuen. The island is surrounded on 3 sides by cliffs. There's a steel fence running all along one side of the athletic field... ...and there's a 10,000-volt current running through it. And over here in the lookout tower, they're armed with guns. In other words, Hell Castle is an impregnable fortress. That's it. Next, I'd like to outline a plan I came up with. We'll approach the island under cover of darkness in lifeboats. We'll slip in through the crevice in the cliff at the back of the island. Saki and Megumi will go free the students. O-Kyo and Yui will take over the lookout tower, and secure the area. I myself will cut the cable that supplies power to the island. Then we'll have the students climb the fence... ...and escape by boat. - Isn't a backup power supply on the island? - That could pose a problem. As soon as the power is cut, the backup will be sure to kick in. Once that happens, it will be all over. - How long will it take for the backup to kick in? - Probably a minute or two. In other words, we're going to have to time everything perfectly and... ...get everything done in that one minute. Everyone... please be prepared. Question! When are we going to fight? Don't get into any confrontations. I don't want just to escape. Listen to me, we're going to be up against professionals. We can't attack them. If we do, we'll get Killed. There's nothing to worry about. I promise you we'll rescue... ...Kikuo and all the other students. I promise you. We'll do it. You've got the Great Sukeban of Kyushu, Yui Kazama on your side! Please, try to cheer up, Megumi... We're carrying out this plan tomorrow night. Got that? I guess I ended up leaning on you again, Yukino. I'm glad you did. I've been imagining what it would be like all along. For you and O-Kyo to come get me someday, and ask me to fight by your side. I've been dreaming of that day... And now my wish has been granted. Same goes for me, too. The one thing I can't stand is boredom. Know what I mean? Here we are, getting all worked up in such peaceful times... ...strange, isn't it? It's not strange at all. It's just that there aren't enough idiots like us in the world anymore. You are quite right, O-Kyo. Who's to say that the peace of the world isn't just a facade? Mr. Nishiwaki! This is the Ultimate Yo-yo. It's made of a new kind of super-concentrated compound metal. It's 4 times heavier than the one you have and can do 16 times as much damage. When you use it, I want you to wear this pad under the collar of your uniform. It's a special pad that will absorb up to 60% of the shock to your shoulder... ...from the yo-yo's return impact. Don't be reckless when you throw it. Overuse it, and it will destroy... ...your arm and shoulder muscles... ...your bones will shatter, and you'll sustain irreparable damage. Mr. Nishiwaki... This is all that I can do for you. Come back alive. I'm sending those girls alone into sure death... I can't live with myself! I received this from a certain plastic surgeon. These are Tokimune Kita's complete surgical records. That's a photo of his new face. The principal of Sankou Gakuen, Hattori. We've got to stop those girls! Come back here! I can't send them into the clutches of that killer! There is... ...no other way. Our hands are tied. Our only option is to place our hopes on those girls. Let's sync our watches. Hey, Saki, does that watch of yours even work? Of course it does! - It's 7 o'clock now, exactly. - Let's adjust our watches. 10 minutes from now, I'm going to cut the power from the fence. Does everyone understand? Yo... SD3! All right. We're going to come out of this alive. Got that? Those of you who are graduating today.. Your diligent training to rehabilitate yourselves shall now be... ...rewarded as you stand here today. I am as proud of you all as if you were my own children! Do it! Well done. We're going to split up. Remember, if any of us are caught, it's over. We've got 6 minutes left. Okay, let's go! In the past, there was a time when I was known as Tokimune Kita. I was intent on reforming the government. But the flames of my passion were extinguished by our inept system! But I myself live on. My beliefs did not die. They rage on inside your souls! I have a formidable ally, you see. He's a central figure in the government. I have no doubt this man will let you use your abilities to the fullest. And after you've pulled off the coup d'etat and other acts of terrorism... ...he will declare a state of martial law. And he will uproot and overturn the rotten society we now live in! And it is then that we shall create a truly ideal nation! Let us drink to that day. Repeat the School Code! We will become good people. We will obey the rules without fail! We will never make our own decisions. I am Principal Hattori's servant. His servant forever! His servant forever! Kanpai! Now then, as part of the festivities, let me treat you to a truly enjoyable event. Something's not right. This is way too easy. You little fool! I'm here to rescue you. Thanks for cluing us in. I see... When that helicopter attacked us, I did wonder how they knew we'd be there. But I get it now. I don't think that what I did was wrong. I did it to save my only brother! You're up against adult wisdom, you see. We don't even consider you a threat anymore. Where's my brother? You promised I could see my brother! Go down to the medical facility in the basement. Saki! They got you too, then? SD2! Saki! I like that look in your eyes. It's better than what I saw the first time we met. But I've had enough of that particular look. It's the same look Kikuo Kato and Kazuo Hagiwara had. I have no choice but to send you off to the next world! Who do you think you are? Look what you've done to these kids! What are you planning to do with them? Do I have to tell you? Youth is to be cherished. But the value of such a treasure... ...rather than a sheep who doesn't even realize... ...he's lost his wool, it is better to be a starved wolf! I'm going to do them all a favor and reinvent them. Screw your favors! The arrogant sheep is the most difficult to save. This is a special night for our top achievers, who should be proud to be graduating. I want you all to take note and remember... ...how skilled and powerful these peers of yours have become. Graduating students, I present to you a living target. Do with her as you will! Stop it! - I can't fight you. You must stop. - It's no use. As long as I give the order, they'll kill even a living human being. You're a hypocrite! Staying out of reach, you force others to make sacrifices in your place! Have you ever fought your own battle, even once? Answer me! You coward! Hold it! That actually might be amusing. Those are the keys that will release the students. If you defeat me, then I'll allow you to free them all. I wonder if you're capable. Just come at me from any direction you please. Stop it! Stop it! You've got to stop! Leave her alone! Please, just stop! SD2, you've got to be strong! Saki! Saki! SD2! Saki! Saki! SD2! Students! If any worthless thoughts still linger in your mind, discard them! Your only glory lies in living your lives for me! Don't be swayed by fools like these! This marks the end of today's special event. Take the intruders to lockup. You know what to do with Saki Asamiya. She's dangerous. This is what happens when you step out of line. Asamiya, I want you to understand... I am doing this against my will... Stop it! What in the world are you doing? Farewell, Asamiya... Don't do this to me! Megumi! Megumi! My brother... My brother... my brother... Saki! Saki! Saki! Saki! SD2! I knew you'd come. Sorry it took me so long to get here. Your weapons are over there! - All right, let's kick some butt! - Let's go! - We're behind schedule, but let's do it. - Understood. I'm going to cut off the power 5 minutes from now. No. Do it in 3 minutes. At 8 o'clock, exactly. SD3... let's go! Right. O-Kyo! You guys, you can go home now! We're leaving how! What's the matter with you? Hurry up! We've only got 40 seconds left! Let's go home! We're getting out of here, okay? Have you all forgotten what it's like to have hope? - What's the matter with you? - Come on, we've got to escape! Has Hattori broken your spirit? Hurry up! Let's go! - Come on! Hurry up! - We can go home now! Let's go home. Come on! Let's go! Come on! You guys... we've got to hurry! Look at him! This is what they want to do to you all! This is what's going to happen to you in the end. Is that what you want? Shit! Why would they do a thing like that? Kikuo... Kikuo! Kikuo! That's right... you've got to leave this place! Come on, guys, let's go! All right? Let's go... 8 more seconds... 5 seconds... 4 seconds... 8 o'clock, exactly! Time for action! Hurry! Use the backup power! Run! Get a move on! Top speed, now! Run! Climb over the fence! We've got no time to lose! Hurry! Run! Run, run, run! Goodbye, Big Brother... Halt! Or I'll shoot! Hurry, now! Hurry! Overuse it and it will destroy your arm and shoulder muscles... ...your bones will shatter, and you'll sustain irreparable damage. SD2! You've got to get everyone over that fence! Oh, damn. Looks like I've run out of ammo. Don't ever screw with Marble O-Kyo! Now's your chance! You go on, too! Saki! SD2! Hurry, get over that fence! Serves you right, bastards! To hell... to hell with Hell Castle! Oh, my God... - Where's Saki? - She's inside. Hurry, everyone! Keep running! Keep running! Everyone, get onto the boats! - Hurry! Get onto the boats! - Hurry! Hurry! All of you! Hattori? Where are you? Hattori! Don't do this. Please, don't do this. Snap out of it! I said stop it! Please, just stop! Please, forgive me! How dare you crush my ambitions! You miserable little rat... I won't let you die an easy death. There was a time when I couldn't forgive other people. But I've never felt hatred for anyone, not once! But now I do hate someone, for the first time. It's you I hate! Ryozan High School, 12th grade, Class B... Saki Asamiya! Also known as the Sukeban Deka! This cherry blossom insignia symbolizes the anger of all the students... ...whose youth you screwed with and ruined! As long as I have this insignia, I swear I'll smash your phony ideals to pieces! Saki... Megumi! Megumi... Saki.. forgive me. Megumi! Megumi! I don't care if it shatters my arm... Hattori... if it's the last thing I do... If it's the last thing I do, I'm going to kill you! Dammit! What the hell is Saki doing? Damned little worm! Now do you see that you're no match for my powers? I shall not die. Nothing will stop me from realizing my ambitions! I hate your guts! Go to hell. That will cut you down to size! Saki! SD2! Saki! - Saki! - Saki! SD2! Saki! Saki! What happened to Megumi? There's a steady stream of escapees from Sankou Gakuen... ...coming ashore. They are escorted by the police. Most likely, everything will come out into the open. Your plans are history. You have been defeated by a group of teenaged girls. Young women of the same generation you were plotting to exploit. Don't worry, we'll take care of the mess. Sisters! Good job. You were great. Mission accomplished! I'm glad you came back alive. Goodbye, Yui. Senpai... Good luck, SD3. Do your best! This time, for sure... it's really goodbye. Saki! Hey, wait up! From my sun-drenched window, I look down at the frozen city. Both sadness and hatred exist only beyond the glass. It's true, if the rest of the world didn't matter... ...I could live my life without feeling pain. But I want to live with all my heart. And walk through the Door to Paradise alone. I'm not quite used to my new shoes yet, and I still feel a little pain... ...but step by step I'm going to break them in... ...so that I can move closer to you. THE END
