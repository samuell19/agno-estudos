- I don't know how you talked me into this, Tommy. Hell, I must be crazy. You know, if the institution ever found out about this, they would haul our butts back in and straitjacket 'em. Permanent. - You didn't have to come, Hawes. This is between me and Jason. I know, I know, I know. But I still don't get the therapy here. All you need to know is Jason's dead, right? Seeing his corpse ain't gonna stop the hallucinations. - Seeing it won't, but destroying it will. Jason belongs in hell, and I'm gonna see he gets there. Okay, there it is? There's his grave. Okay, let's go. - Wait a second. - What? - I got to be sure. - Okay. There's your proof. There's his coffin. Let's go. - Hand me the crowbar. - You're not gonna open that. - Hand me the crowbar. I got it. - I really don't like this. Die! Die! Tommy! Die! Tommy! Die! Tommy! Tommy, get the hell out of here! - Where are you going? Hey, what's that for? Tommy, what are you doing? - Bastard! Shit. Boy. He must've really messed you over. - Yeah, fuck you, Jason. What are you doing? Tommy. Would you just leave that thing alone? Please. Tommy, please. Let's get out of here. My heart can't take any more of this. - Hawes! - Don't shoot. Please. - You in show business, kid? You sure know how to make an entrance. - Look, you got to do something. Jason's alive. He killed my friend. Now he's coming for me. - You better cool out, boy. You already almost got your head blown off. - Will you listen, damn it? - Don't piss me off, junior, or I'll repaint this office with your brains. - Look, Jason is alive. We dug up his body. I was gonna cremate it. - Hold it. Whoa! What's your name, son? - Well, Tommy Jarvis, but, look, we've got to do something. He's even more powerful now... - Aren't you the kid whose mother and friends were killed by that maniac? - Yeah, yeah, yeah. Jason murdered them. - You've been in some psychiatric clinic ever since, haven't you? - What the hell's going on with the weather? Sorry. I didn't know you had... - No problem, Rick. - I want you to meet a former resident here, Tommy Jarvis. He's got some kind of prank... - Look, there's no time for this bullshit! Jason's got to be stopped! - What prank, Mike? - Hey. Hey! Now, that's what's known in the books as "screwing the pooch." Iron this punk. - Wait. You gotta listen to me. Jason's coming here. He's after me! I tried to destroy him, but I fucked up. - You got that right, punk. - You listen to me. I'm sorry about what happened to you and your folks years ago, but no one in Forest Green wants to be reminded of what that maniac did here. That's why we changed the name. People wanna forget this was Crystal Lake. They don't need some kid stirring up Jason shit again. Now, you just lie down and get some rest. In the morning, I'll call that clinic. - No, look, if you just go to the cemetery, you'll see I'm not lying. - Either you get some sleep or I'm gonna come in there and put you out. - You're gonna be sorry you didn't listen to me. - You're gonna be sorry if you don't shut up. - Take a nap, junior. - Will you take it easy? It's hard enough to read this thing. - Well, who told me to take this cow path? - Wait a minute. You admit the sign did say "Camp Forest Green" with an arrow pointing this way? - I admit nothing without talking to my lawyer. I told you we should've left a trail of bread crumbs. - Don't start. So much for the head counselors ever getting back to the camp on their own. I say we stop the car, get out and start screaming for help. I was just kidding, Lizbeth. - Darren, we'd better turn around. - Why? - Because I've seen enough horror movies to know any weirdo wearing a mask is never friendly. - There's no way that we can do this. If the car drops into that gully, we'll never get it out. - Do you have a better suggestion? - Yeah. We're gonna scare him. - We're gonna scare him? - That's right. Just drive towards him. He'll move. Nobody wants to die. - Well, that's a freaking fact. Least of all us. - Will you just drive? He'll get out of our way. - Yeah. That really scared the shit out of him. - No. - That's it. We're driving this baby back to town in reverse. - The hell we are. - Where'd you get that? - Don't worry about it. Just stay cool. - Stay cool? You ain't Dirty Harry. Now, stop it. - All right, scumbag. Get out of the road. Now. - Darren, get back in here right now. He'll kill you. - Not if I get him first. No. No. Please. Please, wait a second. Please. Take these. Please. You can have the... - Come on, Dad. You can at least have Rick drive out to Cunningham Road and look for them. - Megan, my deputy has more important things to do than to look for camp counselors with car trouble. - Come on, Sheriff. Can't you put out an all-points bulletin or something, you know? That would be wicked decent. - Your mother own a sewing machine, kid? - Excuse me? - Hey, off. Hey. Sorry. - It's just that Darren and my sister, Lizbeth, are in charge of organizing the new campgrounds, and we don't know what to do. - And all the little kiddies arrive today. We're not ready to deal with that alone. - I sympathize with you kids. The best I can do is call the station in Carpenter and have them keep a lookout for them. I've got a bad feeling what might've happened to them. Well, hopefully they're fine, but with Jason out there... - Shut up. - Jason who? - Megan, stay away from him. He's dangerous. - I'm not dangerous. Jason is out there. He's looking for me. He's probably headed back to the camp. - I told you to shut up. - You mean the Jason of Camp Blood? - Yes. - No. You kids better leave. This boy is not well, and I need to talk to him in private. - Come on, Dad. We were just- - Megan. Take your friends back to the camp. I'll let you know if I hear about your camp leaders. - Don't beat him up too bad, Dad. He's kind of cute. - Megan, leave. - He's cute. - I was gonna call that clinic and have them collect your ass, but I don't want you around here any longer, poisoning my daughter or anyone else with your warped sense of humor. - They have to be warned, Sheriff. Jason will return to the area that's familiar. No matter what you call it, it's still Camp Crystal Lake to him. - We're gonna escort you to the edge of my jurisdiction. Then we will say goodbye, and we'll never see you around here again. Do we understand each other? - Shit. Shit. Damn. I know I'm gonna get blamed for this. They say old Martin ain't a good caretaker. Hell, I'm a damn high school graduate, and I deserve this job, I earned it. Nobody's gonna find out. Shitheads couldn't even stick him back in right. Well, I ain't gonna touch the slimy sucker. Why'd they have to go and dig up Jason? Some folks have a strange idea of entertainment. - Hey, you guys. You guys, I'm getting worried. - About Jason? - No, about Darren and Lizbeth. They should've at least called, don't you think? Megan? - What? - Hello? - Yeah. - This girl's back in the jail cell with her prisoner of love. - Don't be messing with no crazy jailbird, girl. Those dudes are bad news. And how do you know? - I've been around long enough to see plenty on TV. - TV? - Yeah. - I don't know about that guy, Megan. He seemed pretty weird, with all that Jason stuff. - You know what you need, Megan? I've been telling you this forever. You need a guy like me. Guy who's not so twisted... - Maybe he was telling the truth. Just because our parents keep telling us that Jason was only a legend doesn't mean it wasn't true. What if he did come back here, looking for the camp counselor that caused him to drown as a boy, searching for the one that decapitated his vengeful mother? And you do know what today's date is, don't you? And I can think of only one thing even more terrifying. - What? Yay, the kids are here. Yeah, right! Be careful. You might fall. - Here they are, and they're all yours. - Think I'd rather deal with old Jason. - Once we nail Roy, that's it. Victory is ours. - It's taking forever. I'm starving. - See, that's your trouble, Larry. That's why your sales are always behind quota. Your instinct to eat is stronger than your instinct to win. - You're a real ass, you know that? - Better than being all ass. - That is so unfair. Here we go with unfair again. Listen, war is not fair. - Give me a break, would you, please? This is not war. This is a game. - War is an ugly thing. - I'm hungry. I wanna get a sandwich, okay? - Okay, wait till we kill something and then you can eat. - Calm down a little bit with your attitude, would you? You're an insurance salesman. - Death is my business. - You become this whole other person when we're out here, Stan. I don't like it. - Hey, this is a man's game, requires a man's cunning, a man's intelligence... - With a woman's touch. - Now, wait a minute! I thought Burt shot you! - See any paint? - Sorry, guys. I did in Mr. Commando, weapons and all. Survival's the name of the game, and that flag is mine. - I can't believe this. Burt never gets shot. Never should've let her play. - It's a damn company exec game and she's a damn company exec. - Now, now, boys. Don't be spoilsports. Put on your headbands. - Dumb broad. She tricked me. God, they're gonna laugh for months. She should've stayed in the kitchen where she belongs. A woman shouldn't even be allowed in these games. It's not a game. It's life. - Jason really screwed up that poor son of a bitch's mind. - He really believes that Jason's still alive, doesn't he? - That's not what worries me. It's how far he'll go to try and prove it. Darn. No. No. My God. No. What... Come... Where? No. No. God. - Come on out, you guys! The game's over. - You don't know for sure. What about Roy? Nobody's seen him. - Of course not. If he hasn't accidentally pelleted himself, I'm sure he's lost. - Yeah, well, the game's not over till it's over. Yeah, that's right. - Wait a second. What was that? - What? - Nothing. - I could swear I heard something. - I'm hungry. - God. - Be quiet. My God. My God. Help, guys! Help me! Help! No. Help me, guys! Help! God. God. God. God. Help me. Somebody help me! He's gonna kill me! - Fucking A, what did I tell you? Hit the noise and the cherries. - Sheriff. Sheriff, wait. You got to listen. - I'm tired of listening to you, kid. - I got to... I got to show you Jason's grave. - I've seen it. Come on, get up! Get up! - Please, Sheriff. You'll see we dug it up. - Well, he must've got chilly in the night and pulled the dirt back over. - That's not right. Somebody covered it over. I got to see it. - Freeze it, psycho. - Now see what you've done. You made my deputy draw his revolver. He's been dying to try out his mail-order laser scope. - Wherever the red dot goes, you bang. What's the problem, Sheriff? No problem, Martin. Just a vagrant kid. We got it under control. - Did you cover up Jason's grave? - What? What are you talking about? - Don't concern yourself, Martin. This kid needs treatment. - Jason's not in his grave. Hawes is. Dig it up! You got to dig it up! You got to dig it up! - Dig him up? Does he think I'm a fart-head? Yeah! - Okay. Is this gonna be the best weekend ever? Yeah! - Are we gonna go fishing? Yeah! - Are we gonna scare all the boys? Yeah! - Okay. Are we gonna... Are we gonna not eat Brussels sprouts? - Yeah! - What happened to Cort? - Are you ready? He's taken the young men off to teach them my favorite sport. - Which is? - Boy Scouting, honey. - Cort? You've got to be kidding. You got to be kidding. - Listen, you obviously don't know anything about Indians, okay? Probably none of you do. Look, here's the story. These are called Indian markers, okay? Let's just say you have a chief, all right? And he dumps his squaw or his wife or whatever, and he decides, "Hey, I'm gonna pick up with another woman "and take off with her." So he takes off, leaving his son with the mother. All of a sudden, a week or two later, son wants to catch up with his dad. He wants to learn how to shoot a bow, kill buffalo, whatever these guys do. What happens is he comes along, sees the rocks, says, "Dad, hey, he went that way," obviously. And so, what happens is he comes up, knocks them all down before the mother catches up, because he doesn't wanna see any of her anymore. So, pretty much, that's the basic story. It tells you where to go. - If this is as exciting as it gets, we're in big trouble, dude. - Let's go. Like the sign says, you are now leaving Forest Green. Don't forget to buckle up. You are damn lucky, kid. With all the grief you've given me, you should be leaving wearing your balls as earrings. And if I ever see you around here again, you can guarantee it. Let's get the hell out of here, Rick. J I'll take you home again, Kathleen J To where J J Your heart will feel no pain J J I'll take you home again J - Steven, it's beautiful. God, I love it. I really do. - I don't know. I mean, you know, I'm sort of hurt. You thought I brought you up here just to... Never mind. - Yeah, well, I guess I do owe you. - Yeah. No, look. I have a headache, and I've been working out. - I'm sore. - Yeah. - And... Forget about it. - Well, it's a messy act and... What the heck? - Great. J Again, Kathleen J - Where'd the road go? I can't find the road. Where's the road? Kathleen, you led me astray. What's that? What's that? Darling, you're gonna be the death of me. Yeah, but what a way to go? - Stay here. - Steven, please. - Stay here. - No, Steven. Don't. Steven. Steven, what's going on? - Annette, let's go. - Okay. - Never mind. - What are we gonna do? - We got to get to the sheriff's office. - Pick a card. - I don't wanna play anymore, Sissy. Come on. Pick a card. - No, I really don't. - Okay. Okay. I've got a great game. It's called Camp Blood. - Great. - Yeah. Now, the object of the game is, first you take this jack of spades, which is Jason, all right? And then you have all these face cards, which represent counselors. The queen of hearts is me, okay? Now, who do you wanna be? - Come on, Sissy... - Okay, you be the queen of diamonds. What you do is you shuffle Jason up in these cards here, and you put them in piles, because the piles represent cabins. Now, the object of the game is to find out which cabin Jason is in. - Did Megan say when she's coming back? - Of course not. You wanna bet she took him a loaf of bread with a saw hidden in it? - I'm gonna call her. Hopefully her dad has found out what's happened to Darren and Lizbeth. I say if they're not here by morning, we send all the kids home. We're not prepared to run this. - She saw a monster! - Who did? - It's okay. We're here. - Yeah, honey, we're here. So, what happened? - There was this monster, and he was after me, and he wanted to kill me. - Where? - He was everywhere. - You mean you had a bad dream. - No. It was real, just like on TV. - Okay, listen, sweetie. What's your name? - Nancy. - Well, Nancy. I'm Paula, remember? And this is Sissy. And we're gonna be right out there all night so nothing can hurt you. Okay? So no more bad dreams can come around here? Good. Okay, lay down. There. Okay. Okay. Hey, wait a minute. Where's Cort? - I haven't seen him for hours. I don't know. He called somebody, then he just took off. Said something about checking out things that go bump in the night. J Wake up, middle of the night - You're the best, the best. You got to keep it up till the end of this song. - How much longer? - It's only 10 more minutes. J It's just my nightmare J One lavish nightmare J You call me animal J J That's just not the truth J I'm no animal J J No animal with you J No animal J J I'm no animal J J Tough luck ain't enough for you J Your best friend turned out - Fuck! - Yeah. - Wait a second, I'll... Cort, you didn't already? Come on, wasn't that the end of the song? - Great, just great. If this thing is burned out, frigging Horace is gonna have my butt. - Who's Horace? - My frigging stepfather and asshole in residence. Now, how'd that happen? - What? - Will you go out and plug the cord back in? - Who unplugged the cord? - Smokey the frigging Bear, I don't know. Just go do it. - You know how cold it is out there? - I don't give a shit, Cort. Go do it! - You're a real pain in the ass, a major pain in the ass. Will you hurry up? I got to get this back before Horace finds out I took it. Hurry up. Will you come on? - All right. I'm going. I'm going, okay? God, shut the hell up. - Cort. Nikki. - What are you doing? - Look at this. - What happened to it? - I don't know, but I say unless you wanna look exactly like it, we make this place a memory right now. Nikki, somebody's out there. What if it's that guy Jason? -I don't wanna know. - No way. This isn't happening. - You're right, it isn't. You gonna drive or not? - Whoo! Out of here. - Shit! Damn it, Cort. Shit! - Go! - Shit! Cort! - Whoo! Boy, this baby jams. Let me tell you, for a big truck, it's not bad at all. - That's it! Pull over, I'm driving. - No way, babe, I wanna rock! Yeah! Whoo! Whoo! This is great! I've never driven a house before. I like this. This is great. J Got a synthetic face J J Got some scars and a brace J J My hands are rough and bloody J I walk into the night J J Women faint at the sight; J I ain't no cutie-pie s Sounds like you're having fun back there. What are you doing? Need some company? That sounds great. Do you need some company or what? - Cort! - This is great. I am having such a good time. This is great! J These ain't my arms J J And these legs ain't mine J Hey, Nikki, what are you doing back there, taking a dump? Mind if I come back and snatch a peek? Or vice versa? J I ain't one of the crowd J I ain't one of the guys J They just avoid me J J They run and they hide J J Are my colors too bright J; J Are my eyes set too wide J J I spend my whole life J Whoo! Yeah! J Burning, turning J J I'm a teenage Frankenstein J J The local freak with the twisted mind Nikki, listen to this. J I'm a teenage Frankenstein J - What makes you so high and mighty? You keep forgetting, little Megan, I'm the parent and you're the child. - "You're the child." - That's right. - Well when are you gonna stop treating me like one? - When you stop acting like one, Tommy Jarvis is a very sick boy. How do you know, Dad? What'd you do, take his temperature? - Better watch that smart-mouthing, young lady. - "If your mother were still alive..." - That's it. Out. I don't need this tonight. Out, Megan. Sheriff's office. I'm sorry, he can't come to the phone right now. He's in the can draining his lizard. May I take a message? Oops! Here he comes now. Please hold. It's Rick. - What? What kind of problem? - You better get the hell down here. I found what's left of those counselors, and it looks like someone did them in using Jason's old M.O. - I knew I should have done something about that son of a... Where are you? Right, I'm on my way. - What is it? - Seems your boyfriend wants people to believe Jason has returned. - I thought Jason was just a legend. - That's right. Only, Tommy wants to prove the legend is true. Now, you stay put. And I'm not kidding. Sheriff's office. I'm sorry, he's not in. Can I take a message? Hi. This is his daughter, Megan. I met you this morning, remember? - Yeah, hi. Listen, I've got to talk to your dad about Jason. I've got a plan, but first I need to buy some supplies and- - Tommy, my father's out looking for you right now. Something happened tonight, and he's sure you're responsible for it. If he finds you, he's gonna... - Yeah, he made that real clear. Megan, Jason is out there. I'm positive he's headed back to the camp. He's gonna... - Where are you? I'll come pick you up. - What? - It's the only way. If my father sees you in your car, he's gonna nail you in a second. Where are you? - Karloff's General something... - I know just where it is. I'll see you in a half-hour. - Megan. Okay, lift it. - I want all officers, units and stations within a 50-mile radius alerted about this wacko kid. - Yes, sir. - We have his vehicle description. I want roadblocks... Sheriff, get over here! - Shit, now what? - Come on. Mike, over here. Is that all you found? - I wish it was. I'll order up some body bags. - Our boy sure wants us to believe his story. - Well, he picked the right day to pull this shit. - What do you mean? - Happy Friday the 13th. - All right, who's out there? - What's going on? - Think I hear somebody fooling around out there. - It's got to be Cort. You know how he loves to try and scare us. Teach him a lesson. - You guys, try not to wake the kids. - I'm gonna borrow your car. Now, you can't do this with me. It's much too dangerous. - You're gonna talk about dangerous? You wanna leave that truck out in plain sight? Hide it behind the store, and let's get the hell out of here. - Look, this isn't a game. You're not going with me. I'm already responsible for causing the death... - Look you said on the phone you needed some supplies right? - Yes, but I... - Then let's get going. We can argue about it on the way. You tell me what you need, I'll see to it that you get it. Megan... - Besides, nobody drives this puppy but me. Now, hide that heap and let's book. - Can't this tub go any faster? - You got it. You just keep your eye out for roadblocks. - Okay. There's one. J I'm a rock and roll vagabond - Get down. J I'm a streetwise runaway J 16 when I left home J And I don't regret it a single day Hey! Hey! J I'm a sucker for a loud guitar; J Got one tattooed on my chest J It's hot July J My mouth's too dry J J You know that I'll be screaming J J Hard rock summer J - Unit 45, Officer Pappas to Sheriff Garris, do you copy? - Yeah, I'm here. - We've got a different vehicle that just took off when they saw us, 1 saw somebody duck down. - Got a description or plates? - I got the whole enchilada. It's a '77 orange Camaro. License number Mary, William, 85-10. - That's my daughter's car. - How do you want us to proceed, sir? - With extreme care, asshole. If that kid is with her, there's every good chance he'll do something crazy. - Please, don't do anything crazy. - I know what I'm doing. I got you your supplies, didn't I? If I can just get us to Cunningham Road, I can lose them. Stay down. - Whatever you say. - That's what I want. This is gonna be a hairy turn. Hang on. - Megan, step out of the car. - End of the line. Shit. - Paula, I can't sleep. I'm scared. I saw someone at my window. - Where did you get this? - I found it outside. - You know what? Sissy and Cort are playing jokes. You know, trying to scare each other. - Why? - Well, because grownups think it's funny to be scared. - What? - Never mind. I can't believe it's that late. No one called. I better... - Who are you calling? - Why don't we go and find Sissy and Cort first? Then you can go to bed. - Wait. What if they try to scare us? - Well, we'll scare them right back. - Okay. - Okay. Let's go. Let's find them over here. - I said, shut up! - All he's asking you to do is just check it out. - You got me where you want me. There's no reason... - If I had you where I wanted you, they'd be pumping your ass full of formaldehyde. - Why don't you call the camp and make sure everything's all right? - We have, trying to track you down. The phone there's disconnected. - Doesn't that tell you something? - They should've paid their bill. - Sheriff. - Now, you just sit tight, Jason. As soon as the authorities from Carpenter get here... - Sheriff! You better take this. - Sheriff Garris. What time? I'll be right there. - What's happened? - Rick, keep an eye on this wacko. I'll be back as soon as I can. - What's going on? - And make sure my daughter stays put, she's grounded. - Tell me! - They just found your friend Cort and some girl. Her head was crushed in, and Cort, he had a knife rammed through his skull. - No. - Tommy Jarvis is a psychopathic killer. He wants you to believe that... - It was Jason. Sheriff, when did it happen? - For God's sake, Meggie, stay away from him, please. - What time did this happen? - What difference does that make? - What time? - 8:30, 9:00. Why? - Tommy was with me all that time, Dad. - Rick, I'll call you from there. Lock him up. - Okay, Flash, into the cage. - I'm sure Sissy and Cort are back in their cabins by now. So you just go back to sleep and don't worry. - But what if I get scared again? - You know what I used to do when I was a little girl and I got scared? I would close my eyes and say a little prayer. And you know what? Pretty soon, everything scary went away. It worked for me. I bet it'll work for you, too. Good night. - Good night. - See you in the morning. Cort? Sissy? No! - So, what are you drawing? - So, what's it to you? - Pipe down, Jarvis! - I was just curious as to what she's drawing, is all. - There, you happy? - No. - Why? - Because it stinks. - Okay, give it back. - Come and get it. - I'll get it for you, babe. - Come and get it. - Give it back, punk! - Hey! Hey, hey! Get your hands off her, animal. You little turd! I ought to punch you silly. Let him out of there, Rick. - Megan. Don't clown around. - I'm not the one with the funny red nose. Now, open the cell and let him out. - I'm not kidding. - You better do as she says, because wherever the red dot goes, you bang. - You son of a bitch! You're really screwing up here, missy. Don't... Don't do this, Megan! - I thought he took your key. - He did. But I've got my hide-a-key. - Not this time. - Hey, wait a minute, I... - Look, I appreciate you getting me out, but I have to finish what I started here. - Come on, hot lips, let's go. You drive, I'll navigate. Let me know when we're about to blast into hyperspace. I'll fasten my seatbelt. - I got a bad feeling we're already too late. - Are you sure this is gonna work? Why didn't we just bring the gun and blow him away? - The only way now to stop Jason is to return him to his original resting place, where he drowned in 1957. - Lake Forest Green. - Crystal Lake, where this nightmare began. - Now I lay me down to sleep, I pray the Lord my soul to keep. If I should die before I wake, I pray the Lord my soul to take. Now I lay me down to sleep, I pray the Lord my soul to keep. If I should die before I wake, I pray the Lord my soul to take. - So, what's the story here? - Why don't you boys nose around? I got to break the news to Megan's friends about what's happened. Holler if you see anything. - Like what? - Anything that don't belong. And don't wake the kids. - Come on, handsome. Girls? It's Sheriff Garris. - Hey! My God. - All right, come on out of there. I'm gonna ask you one more time. Come on out of there. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey! What are you doing running around out here? Now, you go on back to bed. - No! No, there's a scary man! - What scary man? - No, no, no, no, ho. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. Everything's all right. Everything's okay, honey. It's okay. Come on, boys, let's go. Come on, kids. Come on. Now, I want you to listen to me very carefully. I want you to all lie down on the floor under the beds. Do not get up until I come back. Do you understand? Now, move, hurry. Come on. Come on. Fuck! - See, they did show up. - Yeah. We'll have to take... - Megan, wait! God. Dad! Daddy! - It's okay. It's me, Megan. Don't be afraid. It's okay. Everything's gonna be all right. Don't be afraid. - Is everyone okay? - They're fine. Fine. It's okay. Everything's gonna be just fine, okay? - I'm gonna go find my daddy, the sheriff, and then we can all go home, okay?
