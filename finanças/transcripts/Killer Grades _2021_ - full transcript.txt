What? Oh, damn it, Amy. No, I can't. Because I can't just go to a party. Because I'm falling behind. If I don't study and catch up, Then the whole team is going to fail. [running footsteps] Well, you haven't seen how they can get. [banging] Wait, shh. Sorry, no. It's just this place, It gives me the creeps sometimes. You win. I do need a break. Can you just text me the address? I'll... no, I'll just grab a ride. Okay. Thanks, yeah, I'll be there soon. [gasps] [horn blares] ♪ Morning, sweetheart. Breakfast is almost ready. I'm going to rob a bank today. Get small bills; don't kill anyone. [chuckles] Thanks. So... Today's the big day. Mom... What? I'm excited. It's not every day your daughter gets to join The academic decathlon team. Okay, but I'm not on the team yet. It's just tryouts. The school year Hasn't even started yet. I know, but of course you're going to make it. I mean, who's more qualified than you? You've been studying all summer. First it's going to be the team, Then it's going to be scholarships, colleges, jobs. The world's going to be your oyster. Mom, stop. What? I'm just excited. I just don't want to disappoint you. Honey, you could never disappoint me. Listen, whatever happens, happens, okay? You're just going to go in there today And do the best job you can, And just know that I am proud of you no matter what. And I know your dad would be, too. He would? Yeah, he always was. All right, so eat up, or we're going to be late. Look at you, two days before school starts, And you're already ahead of the game. I know, I know. All right. Knock 'em dead. Thanks, mom. [sighs] ♪ - Here for the test? - Yes. Great, you can go ahead and sign in right here. Take a seat. We'll get started in just a minute. Are you nervous? Yeah, kind of. Right? I totally am, too. - Sarah. - Michelle. Hello? - Katherine. - Hey, you're here early. Michelle had her decathlon tryouts this morning, So I figured I'd come straight in. Like pole-vaulting? No, no, no, no, no, it's academic decathlon. It's basically where different schools compete on these tests In teams so they can see which kids are the smartest. Sounds like a death sport. Right? But it looks really good on college applications. I can't even believe they're making Michelle try out. They should be begging her to join. That's what I said. Hey, I got you something. What do you got? Everything that we've been looking for. "taking off the wheels." Is this a book on auto repair? What? No, parenting. It's this whole new theory on the relationships That parents build with their kids and when to let go. Okay, Wendy, I love that you read a book on parenting, And you don't even have kids. I know, and I couldn't put it down. That's how good it is. Parents will eat this up. Yeah? So you think it could be pretty big? Yeah, really big. But hey, what do I know? You're the one out there raising the bar As all-time reigning champion mother of every year, So you give it a read, and you tell me. All right, I'll take a look. - Thank you, Katherine. - Yeah. Having an issue there? Uh, no, sir, I'm done. All right, Michelle, we'll be in touch. Nine more minutes, guys, nine minutes. Did you even finish the test? - No, did you? - No. That girl must've cheated, right? How? It's not like anybody else was fast enough to feed her answers. I bet she stole a copy of the test or something, right? It's just weird. There has to be a way to find out, you know? Oh, hi, Mr. Lou, My name is Keri. I have a quick question for you. No, no, no, you guys will be hearing from me Once the tests are graded. Absolutely, it's just going to take two seconds of... Not today, guys. Go home. Oh, well, do you want to get coffee or... - No, not today. - Oh, okay. You should be finding out who she is. ♪ Pouring rain... ♪ ♪ breaking... ♪ You were the first to finish? Yeah, and by a lot, too, I think. Everybody hated me for it. Oh, I promise you they'll get over it. I don't know... No, trust me, they will, and if they make the team, They're going to be happy to have you. Yeah, if I even make the team. When do you find out? Next week, I think. Next week? That's forever from now. Wh... what am I going to brag about until then? [chuckles] you usually find something. Well, you are lucky that I love you so much. Okay, well, now what, ice cream? Who said anything about dessert? Whenever you get a chance. - What, who is that? - That's him, that's Mr. Lou. That's your decathlon coach? Mm-hmm. Oh, he's handsome. Mom, obviously not the point. I'm just saying, he's handsome. He's coming over. Don't embarrass me. No promises. Michelle? Hey, is this your mom? Hi, I'm Katherine. It's so nice to me you. Lou Johnson, same. Yeah, would you like to join us? Oh, I was just waiting for them to get my check, But yeah, I think I've got a few minutes. Come on, have a seat. So I take it Michelle told you about her test this morning? Yes, she did and how she was - First to finish? - Mom! Oh, she wasn't just the first to finish, She was the only one to finish. In fact, I've been giving this test for five years now, And she's the only one to ever finish. How can that be? Well, the test is designed to be too long. That way I can see how the kids do under pressure. But then there's Michelle, Who cruises right through my test And even answers every question correctly. I did? Yes, you did, Which is why I want to invite you To join the academic decathlon team. [gasps] - Really? - What? Yes, really. So I take it you're interested? Am I interested? Are you kidding? Keri, what are you doing back there? Sorry, sorry, I... You need to stay focused. This is why you didn't finish the test. - Now come on, keep up. - I know. Well, it's going to be a lot of work, Tons of hours and, at times, honestly, It can feel kind of like hell. So I just want you to be completely sure, okay? Oh, of course, I'll work hard, stay focused. You know, I love to study. Oh, she loves to study. You should see her room. It's filled with books. I mean, it's a fire hazard. [laughs] okay, well, that's the one that sold me. Looks like my check's ready, so I'll leave you two to be. But Michelle, I really look forward to working together. Thanks, me, too. You guys have a good night, all right? - You, too. - Bye. So about that dessert... All right, ice cream it is. Katherine: You know what? Michelle: Hmm? - You totally deserve it. - Thanks. I'm so proud of you. You did such a good job. Mmm, so good. Um, so when did he say you start? I think just the first day of school. - Oh really? - Yeah. Oh, that's cool. [sighs, giggles] Oh hey, you're dripping. - I am? - All over, yes. Oh shoot, sorry. Um... Okay, you know what? Don't move. Let me get a rag. Okay. No. I didn't put them there. Okay. Uh, any day now. - Here. - Here do you want me to get it? No, no, I got it. There, okay. - Go upstairs; wash your hands. - Okay. Okay, good news. I cleaned it all up. You are off the hook. Hey, you weren't in here earlier, were you? No. Why, is something missing? No, I think I'm just tired. Oh. Not too tired to watch a movie? No, of course not. Come on, let's go. Hey, whatcha reading? Hey. It's a new book on parenting. Yeah, it's about time you learned how to do that. - Ha-ha. - [giggles] Wendy actually recommended it. Is it something you're going to publish? I don't know yet. Wendy thinks it has huge potential, And I kind of think she's right, but I... But you hate success and money. Well, no, no, it's not that. It's just that we're such a small operation, And, you know, a book like this Really is going to take a lot of time And effort to get it going on that level. It's a good thing your daughter's going To spend the next 10 months studying and out of your hair. - But that's not til Monday. - No? No, today I'm going to be a total terror - And ruin your life. - No. I'm serious. Come on, let's go to the movies. Oh honey, no, I can't. I've got to work. But it's the last week of summer. Look, you already know how the book's going to end: I grow up, and I'm perfect because you parented me right. Great, I'm going to go get my shoes. That's it. [phone rings] Hey, did you finish? No, not yet, but I have an idea about the book. Hear me out. Okay, shoot. Case studies. - Hmm? - Look, the reason Moms buy these books is because we worry We might not be doing something right. So if the author had a character Or a case study of a kid who grew up with this method And was successful, then I think moms might really lock right in. Holy crap, you're right. Do you know this guy? Will he work with us? Is he open to notes? Um, well, I kind of know him. Oh, Wendy, don't tell me you dated him. Okay, I won't. Hey, mom. Oh, is that Michelle? Yeah, yeah, yeah, we're... We're just about to see a movie. Oh fun. Tell her I said hi. Okay, hey, honey, Wendy says hi. She says hi. All right, listen, call this author And see if you can get a meeting with him for sometime next week, And then in the meantime, let's you and I get together And go through it chapter by chapter And figure out our notes. - Really? - Yeah. Yeah, I mean, I think this could be really great, Wendy. Okay, I'll... I'll see you Monday. Okay, of course, see you Monday. Ha ha! Are you ready? I better be. Okay, come on, you're going to do great. [no audible dialogue] Michelle? Sarah, hey. I'm so happy you're here, too. - Oh, I'm glad you're here. - [bell rings] All right, guys, let's settle down. First of all, let me just say this: Welcome to the academic decathlon team. You made it. All right? Since I'm new here, I'm going to tell you The most important thing there is know about me, And that is this: I am here to win. And I think we can win. And with all of you, I think we will win. Now a few things to keep in mind in regards to this class: First and foremost, this is a class, And you will be receiving a grade here, And because this is a team competition, You will all be receiving the same grade, Which will be that of the lowest grade scored on each test. Okay, let that soak in for a second. So, like, if one person fails, everyone fails? Exactly. This is to keep you accountable to each other And to make sure we are all working To improve our weakest link. Okay, but Mr. Lou, that isn't fair. We've all got to be in top shape. If you don't like it, then don't fail, And make sure your teammates don't fail, either. Now secondly, since one hour a day isn't nearly enough, We'll be reconvening for a few hours every day After class at various off-campus locations So I can train you to stay focused And avoid distractions such as Mr. Gilbert raising his hand While I'm in the middle of speaking. What can I do for you, Galen? Um... What if we can't actually make it to the afternoon part? It's mandatory. But some of us have, like, jobs. Oh, I see, okay, and where do you work? At café on main. Café on main, great croissants. Do you intend on working there For the rest of your life, Galen? Well, no. Okay, well then that's easy. You quit, okay? Because this is your key to the future, guys. Our morning class, combined with after-school study, Will give us a real competitive advantage. Now, I have been coaching these teams for the last six years, And I have taken my teams to finals for all but one, And every time I get beaten by the bigger school From the big city with extra funding for their teams, And I am sick and tired of losing to these teams. And we can beat 'em. It's easy. We just have to put in the work. - So who's with me? - Yeah. Oh, come on, guys, let's not have this be over Before it even started. I need a little bit more energy out of you today. Who wants to go and win nationals? - Yes! - All right! That's what I'm talking about. Let's get this started. Today's lesson... ♪ ♪ Hi, sweetheart. ♪ ♪ Does anyone have any questions? Yeah, yeah, Mr. Lou, What happens if you multiply that by pi? Let's not get ahead of ourselves. And how about mercutio, Michelle? - "romeo and Juliet." - good. This is a the Fibonacci sequence. And how about prospero, Keri? - "the tempest." - very good. We are on a role, guys, crushing the Shakespeare. Yeah, so you just have to remember You have to add these two at the end. Yeah, but I don't know what two to add. The y is one of the answers. Okay, let me... Who's got it? - Supply-side economics. - Yes. I know it's tough. Anyone think they have the answer? - Sophie? - The war of 1812. Excellent, excellent. All right, should we go into some art history now? - Anyone? - The federal anti-trust laws. Exactly, nice, guys. Sharp work today. What about Iago, Sarah? Uh... "hamlet"? "Othello." Keri, please. Polonius. "Caesar"? No, that's "hamlet." Cordelia. "midsummer night's dream"? - No. - Mr. Lou, I... Please, um, king Duncan. "Macbeth"? Yes, finally. All right, everyone, let's... let's call it a day. Sarah, can you stay so I can talk to you for a minute? ♪ So we want to shorten preschool? Yeah, yeah, with more of the focus on play time. And the chapters on adolescence. Right, exactly. Hi, sweetie. Hey. Michelle... Are you guys doing that book? We have a meeting with the author on Monday. That's great. Hey, how's the decathlon thing going? It's kind of a lot. Yeah, but I bet you're killing it. And I hear your teacher's a bit of a hunk. Come on, let's see this dreamboat. I'm sure you've got a picture. Here. Oh my. Very handsome. Who's that, the one who looks mad? Oh, that's Keri. She's just focused. Yeah, I remember girls like her. All right, Wendy. Uh, you have studying you need to go do. Okay, okay. - Here you go. - Thanks. I'll text you when dinner's ready. - Cool, thanks, mom. - Love you. She's incredible, you do know that? You're such a suck-up. No, I mean it. You should be writing your own book. All right, well, let's get back to this. Play time... ♪ [text chime] [bell rings] Sarah, hey. Just leave me alone, okay? Please. All right, everybody, listen up. I'm very happy to let you know that most of you Did really, really well - On the practice test. - Most of us? Unfortunately, one of you did not, So I had to mark down all of your scores. So what score did we get? A 71? I'm sorry, what? Wait, I would've had a 96? Yup, you could have. No, Mr. Lou, this isn't fair. You guys know the rules. You need to learn how to help each other So you can work together as a team. Okay, well, what if she can't be helped? - Hey. - Okay, no, You don't get to object. You're her friend, - And she still sucks. - Hey, come on. You know what... Sarah! [sighs] Hey, Sarah, wait. Come on. It was just the first test. - We'll get past this. - I think it was my last. No, hey, wait. [rattling] Hello? [clatter] Hey, uh, are you okay? Oh my god, Sarah. Sarah? Sarah, come on. No, no, no. Sarah, come on. Come on, come on. Just breathe. Oh my god. Sophie, call 911. [coughing] Sarah, Sarah, come on. You're going to be okay. You're okay, Sarah. Just keep breathing. Come on, you're going to be okay. Sarah, come on! Are you the one who found her? Smart, rolling her on her side like that. You may have saved her life. She's going to be okay? That all depends on what she took. Was she on anything? I don't know. I found these, but all the labels are gone. Well, we'll run it. We'll see if we can figure out what it was. Was anyone with you in there? No. Uh, wait, somebody was leaving. Someone with her? I don't know. I don't think so. I just heard somebody running away. Somebody else probably found her first and got scared. Would somebody do that? It's a common response in minors. That's my daughter! Don't touch her. Let me see her. - Excuse me. - What's going on? Let me... Okay, right. Okay, thanks so much, Sam. Yeah, bye. That was my friend that works at the hospital. He said that she's still unconscious, But she's stable And that they're going to have to keep her under To help her heal, something about oxygen or... Hypoxia. Yeah, that's it. What is that? It's when part of the body can't get oxygen. It happens in overdose. Well, anyway, that's all he could tell us. We're going to have to speak to the family for more information. I should've seen it coming. I should've known when she ran off. No, baby, no, it's not your fault. I just wish there was something I could've done. Baby, there will be. She's going to need you the most right now. Yeah. You're right. Come here. Thanks, mom. It's going to be okay. [sighs] Try and have a good day, okay? Hey, I love you. I love you, too, mom. - [bell rings] - morning, everyone. Look, I'm going to put today's lesson plan on hold For a few minutes so we can have a chance to talk About what happened on Friday, okay? I did academic decathlon when I was your age, And to this day, it is still one of the hardest things That I have ever done in my whole life. So, if any of you are feeling like You're being pushed too hard, Or like you might not make it, I just want you to know that my door will Always be open to you, And I will always be here to listen to you And try and help in any way that I can, okay? - Keri? - Can we just - Get on with our lessons? - Keri... What? I mean, she already slowed us down and made us fail, So we're just going to throw today away, too? No, Mr. Lou, how much time do we have to waste On someone who should've literally Never made the team in the first place? Hey, we need time to reflect. Yeah, no, we've been reflecting ever since - She got us all an f. - Enough. - Keri, apologize. - No, I'm not gonna apologize... Keri, apologize. - I'm sorry. - No, not just to her, To everyone. I'm sorry. Really I am. I know it wasn't her fault, or anyone's. I guess I was just scared because it happened so quickly. You know, I would hate to think That someone else in this room could be next. So I'm sorry. Thank you, Keri. Let's get started. [phone rings] - Hello? - Hey, are you almost here? You didn't forget, did you? Shoot, you know what? I completely lost track of time. I'm... I'll be there in 10 minutes. All right, see you soon. Bye. Hi, I'm so sorry. Is he here already? Yeah, he just walked in. Do you have your notes? Sh... oh yes, yes, I have my notes. What is going on with you? It's Michelle. One of her friends tried to kill herself. Oh, my gosh, do you want to postpone? No, no, no, I'm fine. Let's just go. Oh, hey. Could you sit in between us? Wendy, you said you didn't date him. No, you said not to tell you that I did, so I didn't. Is this going to be awkward? I sure hope not. - Well, hello again. - Hey, hi, good to see you. And is it Katherine? It is, hi. Big fan of your work. Oh, thanks so much. You want this to have a story. Not really a story, a character. More of a case study. So that moms have an example of what They might be able to hope for. What if they don't like the example? It might not be the type of kid they're looking to raise. Well, I know that as a mom, I would be interested so that I could factor it Into my decision-making. But I didn't write this for parents to pick and choose. I want them to consider the book in its entirety. Well, obviously we want them to read and consider everything. Look, I like you two, But if I wanted notes, I'd go to the majors. The only way I'm choosing a boutique Is if you print it as-is, no changes. I can't believe he got us to agree to that. No, I know, but he's right. Someone else will publish it his way if we don't, So we're just going to have to bust our butts On this one and make it so successful That no one will ever change our notes again. You know he doesn't deserve that. I know, but we do. Let's start gathering prices. - No, this is your fault. - Wait. She wouldn't even be taking those pills If it wasn't for you. You know exactly How hard you were pushing her, and you didn't stop. - Mr. Connor, please? - No, I'm shutting you down. I don't care what it takes. This whole team should Be disqualified, and I'm going to get it done. Enjoy it while it lasts. He just kept yelling at Mr. Lou. He told him that he was the reason She was even taking the pills. Then he said he was pushing us too hard. Is he? I mean, yeah, it's hard, But it's just kind of like how it is. I just can't imagine what that poor man Must be going through. Do you think we could go see her? Yeah, of course. I mean, we should probably give them some time, you know, Especially after what you just told me. But maybe we could go in the next few days? I'd like that. Okay, then we'll do it. Thanks, mom. [bell rings] Yeah, yeah... Yeah. Explain to you the grading system. [chattering] All right, good morning, everyone. I'm sure you've noticed a new face in the room. This is Kevin. He just transferred over And will be filling in for Sarah So we can keep our team total at six. Say hello, Kevin. Uh, hi. What about when Sarah comes back? Well, should she recover and want to rejoin the team, Then Kevin will step aside, becoming an alternate But still studying with us in case anything else happens. I will? Yeah, it's an important role. Kevin, please. All right, I want to start off today with a lecture in history. So we'll begin talking about Mr. Andrew Jackson, Who was of course president number what, Michelle? Uh, eighth. Seventh? What? Andrew Jackson was president number seven. Van Buren was eight. Oh, uh, yeah, you're right. Thank you, Galen. Known as old hickory, Andrew Jackson was first elected in 1828. Hey, what is going on with you? What? What do you mean? You're supposed to be kind of some secret weapon, And you don't even know the presidents? I do, I was just... Yeah, you were distracted. Look, that's great. I'm sorry about your friend and all, But she made me fail a test, And I'm not about to let you do the same. So get your head in the game. Got it? Right, I understand. Yeah, no, it's good. Okay, all right, thanks, Erin, we'll be in touch. Well, that was the cheapest price yet: 6,000 copies at $5 apiece But only if we get it to them by Friday. - Next Friday? - Yeah. He doesn't have any orders to fill in the next week, And he says he'll forego his margins. He wants to get his guys the shifts. But we don't have art. We're not even formatted yet. Well, now we know how much work we have to do. - Katherine... - Look, I know it's crazy, But the next best price is seven bucks, So if we wait, it's going to cost us an extra $12,000. Well, I guess we have to do the work anyway. Yeah. All right, let's give it a shot. [bell rings] - Hey, uh, it's Michelle, right? - Yeah, hey. Do you know where we're supposed to be going right now? On Tuesdays it's café on main. Cool, thanks. Uh, can I walk with you? Yeah, sure, I guess that's cool. Sweet, thanks. Hey, can I ask you something? Yeah, what's up? Do you think that girl's going to come back, The one I'm replacing? Her name is Sarah. Sorry, I was just wondering Because I really want to be a part of the team, And I don't want to lose my chance. What? She was my friend, okay? You know what? Just leave me alone and find your own way. And the most abundant element in the entire world is what, Kevin? - Hydrogen. - Yes, followed by what? Helium then oxygen then carbon, Neon, nitrogen, magnesium and silicon. Oh, okay, looks like someone's been studying. All righty guys, let's call it for today. Don't forget, tomorrow's going to be another round of history, So let's make sure to study up tonight, okay? All right, good, let's get out of here, guys. Oh Kevin, great job today, man. You're exactly what this team needs. Really? Thanks. Hi, Mrs. Connor. Michelle, hi. I hope it's okay that I'm here. Of course it is. Come in. She could use a friend. Do you know if she's doing any better? They say she is. They just need to keep her out to see how she heals. Michelle, could you stay here for a second? I just need to run down the hall. Yeah, yeah, of course. Okay. Talk to her. I know she'll like that. Hey, Sarah, it's me. Class sucks still. I know Keri still only cares about herself, And Galen is still backing her up. They brought in some jerk to replace you, Like you were never even there. And everyone's treating me like crap now. I just wish you would've told me what was wrong... That you would've talked to me about it. Just wake up, okay? Please, just wake up. I miss you. Oh, Michelle. Did you see... Did you see Sarah? Yeah. Okay. Do you want to go? - Yeah. - All right. [sighs] How's her dad? Is he doing any better? I don't know. Her mom said she hasn't seen him. What, like, at all? I mean, since when? I don't know, she just said that She doesn't know where he is, And I guess she thinks he left town. Honey, is everything all right? Not really. Here, you know what? Let me... let me pull over. Honey, what's wrong? - I can't do it anymore, mom. - Do what? It's the team. I have to quit. - I just... I can't do it. - Did something happen? Yes, and it just keeps happening. First it was Sarah, and then he just replaced her. He just doesn't slow down for anything, And I can't take it anymore, mom. I can't do it. Oh, honey, You... you wouldn't have disappointed me. If the team's not the right fit for you, Then it's not right for you. I totally support Any decision that you want to make. - Thank you. - It's going to be okay. I'm sorry, dad, I tried my best. Wow, it's so early. No one is here. Do you want me to wait in the car? No, it's okay. I want to talk to Mr. Lou Before everyone gets in. Gosh. What am I even gonna do after school now? You're going to take it easy. Just relax, You'll find your footing, and I'll help you Figure things out as soon as Wendy and I finish the book. I can help you guys. Oh honey, that's okay, you don't have to. Mom, you definitely need the help, And I'm going to have all this time now. It could be like an internship. I'll think about it. Let me talk to Wendy. Thanks, mom. Hey, everything's going to be okay. Do you want me to come in with you? Do you need my help? No, I can do this. What are you doing here? Look, just leave me alone. You better be prepared today. You don't ever have to worry about me again. What? Come in. Oh Michelle, good morning. Good morning. What's on your mind? Um, can I talk to you about something? Yeah. What's on your mind? I have to quit the team. Have to or want to? Both. I'm sorry, I'm just really not happy. Michelle, you promised me. When I sat down with you and your mom, - You said that you could do this. - I know. And I really thought I could, but I didn't think It would be this hard. At least if I go now, you have enough time - To find someone else. - What does she say about this? - Who, my mom? - Yeah. She's supportive. She needs me more now anyways, And at least I'd have my afternoons back So I could help her at work. Michelle, what if it wasn't so difficult? - What do you mean? - I just mean, What if there was a way to make it easier on you? How? You're not on any other sort of Prescription drugs, are you? No, why? What are those? These are study aids. That one's Adderall, which helps tune out the world Around you and helps you focus, And that one's Xanax, which calms you down If you're feeling a little too stressed out. Did you give those to Sarah? I did, yes, But had I known about her history of substance abuse, I never would've offered them to her. Sarah had a drug problem? Yeah, she didn't tell you? That's why I asked if you were on any other prescriptions. Look, I don't want to talk about Sarah right now, okay? I want to talk about you, Michelle. You are my star student, and I don't want to lose you. I mean, this team is good, But you are amazing, and with you on it, I think we stand a serious shot of winning this whole thing. Now, the pressure, the stress, I get it, I really do, But all you have to do is endure it long enough for us to win Just once, and then the whole world becomes your oyster. So just give it a try. And if it doesn't work, hey, it doesn't work, But at least you can say you tried. Okay. Okay, yeah, I'll do it. Good, I'm glad. Just be responsible, okay, not like Sarah. Adderall to come up; Xanax to cool down. And no more than one of either of them every four hours, okay? All right. Hey. Nobody can know about this, okay? Yeah, I understand. Take the rest of the day off. Go home, try them out, Get used to them and then come back tomorrow. Uh, yeah, okay. I'll see you then. Okay, see you, Michelle. Whoa, Keri. - What was that about? - What are you doing here? No, Michelle, did she just quit? - We need her to win. - Settle down. I'm the teacher here. She's not going to quit: I talked her out of it. She just had her mom in her ear Asking to help out at work, that's all. Okay, well, what happens if her mom gets in her ear again? That's not your problem, Keri. You want to win, go learn how to do math. I know how to do math. Hey! Katherine, go home. I just need coffee. No, you just need sleep. Come on, I'm not going to let you work late here - All by yourself. - Why not? I would do the same thing to you, probably will do, Just wait until next week. Really, it's fine. Thank you. All right, um... I will see you tomorrow. Yeah, see you then. - Good night. - Night. ♪ [thudding] Katherine? Katherine? What? [gasps] ♪ Huh? [sighs] [knocks on door] Shoot. [knocking] Hey, mom. Hi. Are you okay? Yeah, yeah, no, I'm just really in a zone. Oh. All right, well, I've got to go to bed. I'm exhausted. I just wanted to make sure you've eaten. Yeah, no, I'm good. Okay, good night, mom. [phone rings] Hello? Yes, who is this? What? Um, let me through, let me through. Whoa, whoa, whoa. - That's my shop. - Ma'am... - That's my shop. - Ma'am, please. Wendy... [text chime] [gasps] oh, thank you. Detective: We just got the call four hours ago. One of the neighbors was out walking his dog And noticed the door was open. She was already gone when we got here. I just don't understand why somebody would do this. I mean, we're a printing press. There's nothing of value in there. Do you have any enemies? Enemies? Yeah, anyone you might have upset? Given the damage in there, It's unlikely this was just a break-in. Whoever did this wanted to tear this place apart And make sure it hurt. We don't think the burglar meant to kill ms. Adams, But she saw them. Maybe they felt they didn't have a choice. I should've been here. I almost stayed. Don't think that way, ms. Carter; We might be pulling two bodies out of there instead of one. Got to get you over here, detective. Hang tight, all right? I'll be back in a moment. Wait, do you still need me? Yeah, I'm sorry. We need to walk through your shop To see if anything's missing. As of last night, the date for our first decathlon meet Has officially been set for November 5th. That means we've got just six weeks To get ourselves totally prepared. Thus I'll be adding practice tests Every Friday from now until then. - Ugh, every Friday? - Yes, Galen, Every Friday, and they won't be easy, either. So any outside plans you may have, I suggest you cancel because I need you studying Every waking moment, you got me? - Yeah. - That goes for everybody. - Do you all understand? - Yes. Good. Now let's get into today's lesson. [bell rings] Michelle... You did a really great job today. Thank you. How are you feeling? Are things getting any easier? Yeah, yeah, it really is. Good. Just don't overdo it, okay? No more than one pill every four hours, - And do not mix them. - I understand. Okay. See you at practice. - Yeah, see you then. - Okay. [phone rings] - Hi, Dr. Miller. - Is it true? Excuse me? The police came by. They said Wendy was killed while working on my book. Please tell me that's not true. Katherine, I'm so sorry. That's awful. She deserved better. Yeah, she really did. I can only imagine what a great job You two would've done for my book. Wait, um, you say that as if you're pulling it. You're not, are you? Katherine... Doctor, Wendy really wanted this book. She believed in it, and... and now she's dead. You have to let me do this. I mean please, I can't lose this, too. Katherine, I'm sorry, but I don't want to have To think about that every time I think about my book. I'll reimburse you for the time you've put in, okay? No, you signed a contract. - I'm sorry? - No, I'm sorry. I have the rights to this book, And it will stay mine as long as I hit my deadlines. But you won't. You don't have your shop or the manpower. I have someone who is ready to work, and she knows the job. Katherine, I will call my lawyers if I have to. You don't want this. No, but Wendy would. So you go do what you need to do; I have deadlines I need to meet. [sighs] [bell rings] Michelle, hey. Hey, are you going to practice? Yeah, want to walk with me? Yeah, let me just get something from my locker. Okay. Okay, you ready? - Yeah, let's go. - Cool. [sighs] Michelle. Just go ahead. I'll catch up with you later. Oh, okay. - Are you ready? - Ready for what? To go home. I'm here to pick you up. - What? Why? - Because school's over. Mom, I can't go, I have practice. You do? Yeah, I do. But honey, I thought you quit the team. Okay, well, I didn't, okay? I changed my mind. Look, I'll be home later. Honey, what's going on with you? This isn't like you. Well, I guess it is now, okay? Just go home; we'll talk later. - Sweetie, I... - Just go! [sighs] And that's a time using fractions Can be your best friend because it allows you To get to the answer more quickly. And, uh... Found us. Just in the nick of time. Today's lesson is in physics, Which means we'll be talking a lot about Albert Einstein, Who is most known for... Michelle? Hey, Michelle, you with us? - Huh? - I was just asking What Albert Einstein is most known for. - He was known for the theory... - The theory of relativity, Which is actually just two interrelated theories Of special relativity and general relativity With a mass-energy equivalence formula Of e=mc squared. What the hell? Oh my gosh. What? - Mom. - Michelle. Mom, what the hell? - What? - Who smashed your shop apart, And why is there an outline on the ground Like somebody died in there? [sobbing] No. - Mom? - I am so sorry. No! How could you not tell me? Honey, I tried. That's why I came to pick you up from school today. But you didn't say anything about it. But you weren't listening. Oh, so it's my fault? No, no, of course it's not your fault. - I wanted to tell you. - Yeah, you know what? Maybe you should read that parenting book after all. Michelle... Just leave me alone. - Michelle. - Go away. [door locks] Detective Chatman? It's Ortiz. I found the car. [gasps] What? Oh no, no, no, no, no. [door slams] Michelle. Michelle. [sighs] Michelle. Adderall. Side effects: Irritability, Mood swings, aggression... Suicidal thoughts. Okay, and what to do if your child is on drugs? Okay. Looks like we can call off the search: We just found Mr. Connor. All right, everyone, you've done a great job this week in class, So I'm really looking forward to seeing What you can do on these tests. Go ahead and pass them down, Make me proud. [phone buzzes] Hey guys, phones away. Whoa. Sarah's dad was murdered? - Says who? - What? Hey, tests are out. - Will Wymore said it. - [phone buzzes] He said they found a car, and his body's in the trunk. - Galen! - He's pulling your leg. No, Dustin Jones just texted me the same thing And a picture of the cops. - What? - Yeah, look. - Oh my gosh. - Did he send this to you? Hey guys, hey, can everyone please settle down? Eyes up here, please. The tests are out, And if you don't settle down right now And put those phones away, then I swear to you I will rip up every single test, And I will fail all of you. That will be a zero for everyone, Do you hear me? Hey! I'm sorry for yelling, okay, It's just we are on a tight schedule, And I do not want us falling behind on these tests. We can't take the test now. - Michelle, please. - She's right. Yeah, that's... that's too messed up. Oh my gosh, You guys, who the hell cares? Since when do you all care about Mr. Connor? Seriously, he was the one who was trying to shut us down - In the first place. - Okay, Keri, stop. No, no, I am sick of the laziness, Mr. Lou, I'm sick of it. Okay? I'm trying to get into vanderton, And if everyone here is going to jeopardize my chance At getting a scholarship, then what's the point If everyone here is just a little bit sad? - Hey, shut up! - No, no, You shut up, Michelle. Oh my gosh. Why are you still here? You're like The bad luck charm of this town, okay? You know your little friend, Sarah and her dad? Actually, half the town is talking about What happened at your mom's shop last night After you tried to quit the team And go work for her. How did you know that? Everybody knows it. No, how did you know That I was planning to work for her? Oh my god, Michelle, shut up. Michelle, please, we're eating Into our test-taking time right now. Hey... Hey, Michelle. - What are you doing? - I'm going home. - No, sit back down. - No, you can still all Take the test if you want to, but it's a zero for me, So I guess that makes it a zero for you guys, too. No, Michelle, you don't want to do that. - I just did. - Just listen, Michelle... What have you done, hmm? You keep doing this. You keep taking everything way too far. Keri, where are you going? Well, if we aren't gonna win, what's the point? [shouts] What are you looking at? Get back to your tests. Look, everything's going to be okay. I'm going to figure out a solution. Stay right here; finish your tests. What? Sweetheart... Mom, I need help. Come on. So you're saying your teacher gave you pills? Yes, but it's not his fault. Okay, he was just trying to take the pressure away So class would be easier. Oh my god. Honey, that is not okay. Mom, you don't know what it's like in there. It's intense. Everyone is dependent on everyone else, And if you slow down for even a second, then... If you slow down, then what? Look at you. You've barely slept, And you haven't even changed your clothes. Michelle, please. Mom, I don't think Sarah tried to kill herself. I think someone else just wanted it to look like that. What? Honey, who? One of my classmates, Keri Belasee. She would yell at Sarah in class, like, All the time, and Sarah was so scared. And I know there was somebody else in there - When I found her. - But sweetie, I don't think that that proves that she didn't do it herself. No, but Keri was also there when Sarah's dad came And threatened to end the team, and somebody killed him, too. What? They found him today. - Oh. - And she was also there When I went to quit the team And told Mr. Lou that you needed help with your shop, And then your shop got torn apart... And Wendy... Okay, Michelle, if what you're saying is true, Then we have to go to the police, And you have to be willing to tell them everything. I know. [knock on door] No, no, no, mom, mom, don't. No, it's fine. - Lou? - Is Michelle here? - Um... - Hey, Michelle? Whoa, whoa, whoa, hey, you can't be here. Michelle! Look, Michelle... - Hey, what are you doing here? - I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Listen, I just wanna tell you to come back to the team, - Okay, that's all. - You need to go, Lou. I just need to talk to her for a second. You gave my daughter drugs. What? You told her? No, no, no, she needed them. - She asked for them. - No, I didn't. Yes, you did, and you said that they were helping. - Please, Michelle. - Okay, you know what? - I'm calling the police. - No, you are not. - Stop it, Katherine. - Hey, get your hands off me. Michelle, call the police. No, nobody is calling the police, okay? [screams] ow! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa. It was you. This whole time I thought it was Keri, - But it was you. - Michelle, listen to me, okay? No, you killed Sarah's dad, And you killed Wendy, And you tried to kill Sarah, too. I did this for the team. - I did this for you. - What? I did this all for you, Michelle. Look, I know how hard it is, okay? When I was your age, and it was me on the team, We struggled every day, but we knew we had a shot. And then the best student decided to quit, Left us in the dust, And I've always wondered what my life would be like If he hadn't. And that's why I teach these teams, Michelle. So nobody else has to miss out on the life that I could've had. And if giving you pills helps, Then so what? It doesn't hurt anybody. I made sure you weren't on anything else. What if I lied? I made sure. I checked your medicine cabinet. You were safe. You broke into our house? Just to protect your daughter so I could give her a chance. But that's not fair. Neither is anything, okay? Come on, Michelle, just come back. I do not want to have to run this team without you, But I will if I have to. - Michelle, call the police. - Shut up. Michelle, he's going to kill us both. Grab your phone and go. Michelle, if you do that, She will die. Ah! - Michelle, run! - No, Michelle! Help, mom! Mom, help! Right here, honey. Michelle, come back, I can explain. Ah! [gasping] Ah! [screams] [sobbing] Do you think he's going to live? Well, the blade didn't hit any organs, So he should be able to stand for trial. For all of this, I hope. For this, for Sarah, for her father, For Wendy, and distributing drugs. There was also a decathlon hopeful At his last school that suddenly fell in front of a car. The city ruled it out as an accident, But we're going to look into it, as well. Oh my gosh. I'm just glad we got to him when we did. I'm so happy you're all right. Mom, I'm so sorry for everything. You know, I'm ready to help you with the book whenever you need. No, don't worry about the book. He's going to take it away from me, anyway. But Wendy wanted that. Yeah, but you know what? There's something she wanted even more. Well, that's exactly why I wrote the book: To educate kids and parents on what to watch out for With teachers like Mr. L. Close the book; eat your food. Oh, well thank you. I'm actually a huge fan of your publication, too. Yes, um, thank you, That's very kind of you. Yeah, I would say that I was inspired: My daughter. - Did you hear about Keri? - I heard she failed - Another drug test. - Yeah, expelled, too. Well, she always wanted us to be responsible for our own grades. Now I guess she is. Can you believe we're finally going to get To go to the decathlon meet? Just glad we have the right coach. All right, everybody, big day tomorrow. - Is everybody ready? - Yeah! Good. Just remember, I believe in each and every one of you, And I cannot wait for you to show the district How smart you are. Now, let's talk about... [music]
