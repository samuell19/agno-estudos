We have a big problem here, girls. Your behavior is completely unacceptable. Mr. Connor... Did we do something wrong? The three of you have been disrupting my class and you're making it difficult for the students who actually want to learn something. Not only am l going to call your parents, but you all have detention. Not only am l gonna call your parents... But you all have detention. You've got detention You've got detention You girls think this is funny? No, Jim! l don't find anything funny about this. l wasn't finished! Put these on! l don't think these are appropriate to wear here. You fucking imbecile, did l stutter?! l said put 'em on. This is outrageous! l'm just trying to give you girls a good education! Ooooh... We'll give you a good education... ADULT education! Just let me go! Somebody really needs detention. That was fun, right? Yeah, that was crazy. l love it when it's the three of us together. lt's like Charlie's Angels, look out! More like Hells Angels. And Natalie... that dildo was way too big to use on him like that. But l think he liked it the way he was moaning. You think he liked it? Who cares. l liked it. Are you girls hungry? So hungry l could eat the balls off a snake right now. You know, l have the strangest craving for foie gras. Eew! That's nasty! The way they force-feed those poor little geese - it's animal cruelty, you know. Honey, you the last one to be talking about animal cruelty after what you just did to that poor man. Ashtray. Taboo, good afternoon. Hold please. Janet, line 2. Taboo, good afternoon. Marie, line 4. - Hey V. - Hey. Do l have any new bookings? You have Tony at 3 o'clock... You have a 4:30 with a new guy into latex fetish and heavy bondage, and Karen and her husband want to push to 7. - Can you e-mail me that to me? - Sure. Jim should be ready. Let me write him up so you can get out of here. All right, we got an all-girl gang bang, CBT, nipple, humiliation - verbal and physical - foot fetish, spitting, forced fem, rape fantasy, heavy cursing... Ah! Face slapping... l've gotta last minute booking - basic trampling and a golden. Any takers? Nah, l'm good. l'll do it. All right. Don't do nothing l wouldn't do. Later, beauties. He's gonna be here in 20 minutes. Awesome. [ Skipped item nr. 75 ] Hi, Natalie. lt's Grandma. l have great news... l think l found someone for you. Call me back. [phone rings] Hi, Mommy. Sure, l'd love to. OK... l'll see you later. Natalie, l think you should go back to being blond or at least put some blond highlights in your hair. lt looked so beautiful that way. Thanks, Ma, but the bleach dried out my hair. l like it better natural. Ma, she looks beautiful the way she is. l know she does. What's going on with your hair? l just got it cut this morning. lt's a little too short, isn't it? l mean, just don't go any shorter. l've been getting my hair cut like this for a year. Nat, you think it's too short? No, it looks real cute. l like that dykie look. What? l mean, if l saw you on the street l'd definitely think you were gay. Natalie, not everybody sees things the way you do. Maybe it's not about the hair. Then what is it? You know what it is? lt's the hair with the clothes, it's the way you carry yourself. Everything about you screams, ''l don't need a man.'' Some people might confuse that with being gay. Well, just because l don't walk around town with long, red, flowing hair and my tits and ass hanging out, doesn't make me gay. l'm sorry. My bad. Do you forgive me? C'mon, Becca, forgive me, pretty please! l like your hair the way it is. - Come on. - OK! Rebecca, how's work going? lt's going pretty well, actually. l have an evaluation next week. and l think l'll be getting a promotion. - Congratulations. - That's very exciting. How about you, honey? How's work going? lt's good. l've been working on some other things though. That's great. Finally use your Psychology degree... The one l sent you to school for? Cute, Ma. Seriously, though... l'm going into the film business, Ma. Film? Well, that's something new. Now, l know you don't wanna hear this, but l think it would be nice if one of you young ladies would just start to think about settling down and having a little one. [both laughing] C'mon! l want someone to call me Grandma before l get too old to be bothered by it. Oh, that's easy... Grandma! - Nana! - That's not funny. - Granny! - OK! OK, fine. Can we change the subject? What time is it? l don't know what time it is. Are you going uptown any time soon? No, l'm staying here with Nana. Granny's my date. Why didn't you invite me? We thought you were going out with your friends. You can stay with us, honey. What are you doing tonight? Yeah, hang out with us. Goin' out with my friends. Hey, Joe! How you doin'? Hi, Nat. l am good! You comin' out with us tonight? No. l gotta work at that new club on 46th Street. - Swank! - Yeah! l know the owners from this place that l danced at in Vegas. That's cool. Where's Mel? She is in the bedroom doing a session. ln the bedroom? She turned the extra room into a dungeon so she could get some work done on the side. - Hey, baby. - Hey. Hey, watch that thing! So you're doing sessions now? Oh, yeah. But l screen them down to their diets. Where are we going tonight? Juicy's. We always go to lesbian clubs. Why can't we go to a straight club? Because we're lesbians. Oh, yeah. All right... l'll go with the girls tonight. But l need to be around some men some time soon. You're around men all the time. No, some real men. Ah, come on. You know you love the ladies. No... You love the ladies. [door buzzes] Oh, shit. That must be Sonia. What the fuck is going on in here? Which one of these lucky bitches you 'bout to put it on? Stop it! l'm in a session. Uh huh. - Hey, mamacita. - Hi, doll. You look fierce, as usual. Thank you. You are so damn cute! Okay, all right! So, who's not ready? That would be... You! l gotta finish my session, don't l? C'mon! l thought you fucked your bitch already? Tinkle-tinkle. Aw, c'mon! Bitch! Get your sissy-ass out here! What is this now? Oooh, you have a sexy little slut. You think? l'm gonna soak this little slut's panties. Hey, you wanna try? Yeah, l need the practice. Practice? Yeah, l'm gonna start doing sessions. To the bathroom. [giggling] Do you realize it's been a month since l broke up with Bianca? And l'm going crazy! Not to mention l'm horny as fuck! You'll meet someone else. There are plenty of fish in the sea. Hold up. l don't want no parts of no fishy chicks! l don't do sushi boo, OK? l have to meet a girl that's a straight-up masochist. That's what l really need. ln our line of work, we are destined to always be single. Speak for yourself! l mean, it's not like we're porn stars! Now they have issues! [door buzzes] Please! No need to stand up, no need to bow down, watch out girls... 'cuz l'm the hottest man in town! Hi, Noah! What's up, hotnesses! Damn, girl! - Hi, honey. - l missed you, sweets. - Noah! - What? This is Natalie. l know Natalie. A fairly frequent client of mine. l live right around the corner from you, girl. Really? l didn't know that. How long have you lived there? How long? Shit... Let me put it to you this way. l remember when the neighborhood was nothin' but abandoned buildings and crackheads and dope fiends... before these yuppie bastards and trust-fund babies came in here and fucked up my once quaint little 'hood. l know you're not tryin' to call me a Yuppie! No, l ain't tryin to say you're no yuppie. l'm just sayin' they took all the hustle off the street, which is cool, but they also put out all the working class people on their asses. Yeah, it's fucked up. Now me, l just had to evolve my game a little bit. lnstead of hangin' out on the corner and y'all comin to me, l come to you. Our friendly neighborhood delivery man. Tips are appreciated. But for real... this is just a little side hustle to keep the lights on. You feel me? ln here... tryin' to do that artist thing. Oh, OK. What kind of artist? l used to do a little taggin' back in the day. l parlayed that into a little bit of paintin', little bit of rhymin'. But the thing that's really settin' me off... is this writin' thing... Like what? A book? Poetry? Screenplays.... And from pen to pad, girl, l am writin' down some shit that is alive! Hey, aren't you working on something like that? l heard about you, little Miss Tarantino. Yeah, l'm workin' on a few things. Then you guys should totally collaborate on something really fabulous. Collaboration, huh? You like brown babies? That's what's up! ln the meantime, how about we collaborate on this L? Here you go. lt's tight, ain't it? l know it is. Here, Mel. This is some good shit. Thanks! So...should l call a slave to chauffeur us? Most definitely. Big Pimpin' for sure! Hey Pimpstress, you got five minutes. Look at little mama there. Shut up. You hear the reggae remix of Purple Haze? Nah, is it good? You know he was murdered, right? Who? Jimi Hendrix, yo! He was down with the 27 club. Oh, God... He was one of the revolutionary artists that was murdered by the government at the age of 27. Oh, l see... You're one of them, right? - One of who? - Conspiracy theorists. That's exactly what they want you to think! That's a whole fuckin' conspiracy right there! For real! Check out the list of names of motherfuckers who all had mysterious deaths. Now l'm not talkin' about the way they died, but at the time, all at the height of their careers, when they had the most influence over a motherfuckin' revolutionary generation! l'll be right back. All right, mama. John Lennon - shot in Central Park. Bob Marley, cancer in his big toe. At 27, Janis Joplin... [phone ringing] Uh, yeah. This is Jim. Hey, Jim. Workin' late again? Ashley? You sound surprised. Yes, Miss... l...l just didn't know you had this number. Oh, this won't take very long. l just wanted to tell you it was so funny what we did to you. Um...OK. You wanna see something even funnier? Check your e-mail. Bye, Jim. [screaming in pain] Marvin Gaye - shot by his daddy. At 27, Jimi Hendrix choked on his own vomit in an ambulance. ln an ambulance, yo! How the fuck you choke on your own goddamn vomit in a motherfuckin' ambulance?! lt's in an ambulance! Ain't somebody there that's supposed to save him?! lt's motherfuckin' Jimi Hendrix for Christ's sake. Curtis Mayfield - hit by a stage lamp. Tupac Shakur - shot on the Vegas strip. And don't even get me started on the non-27-year-olds... Black Panthers, MLK, Malcom X, Bruce Lee, Lenny Bruce, Kurt Cobain, Timothy Leary with the drug experiments! Damn, you got issues. We ready to get outta here? Noah, you do know we're goin' to a lesbian club? Hell, yeah! Some of my best motherfuckin' clients is up in there. The herb has no problem with da girl-on-girl action, mon! Don't matter if you're black, white, red or brown. As long as you got cash, you can all be down. Woo! That shit is tight! l can connect with my feminine side, which allows me an ethereal connection with lesbians, so... [phone ringing] Hi, Natalie. lt's your Grandma. Sara's friend's son, he's a nice Jewish boy. We want you to meet him. You're not so young anymore. You should live to 1 20. Damn, ma... You still got an answering machine? You got a beeper too? lt's for my grandmother. She just figured out how to leave a message. You are a lesbian, right? Couldn't you tell? Oh, shit... l'm sorry. ls this some kind of sign? l just met you and you're already bleeding on me? l'm so embarrassed. l'll clean it up. l'll get it. You want somethin' to drink? Do you have a tampon? ln the cabinet, under the sink. Where are we, anyway? Lower East Side. So, l'll call you. Yeah, you'll call me. [phone rings] Hello? - Hey. - Hey. What a surprise. l didn't expect to hear from you so soon. Yeah, l know. The rules and all... but l just wanted to say l had a really good time with you last night. Yeah, me too. Bye. So, how was it last night? AKA, this morning? And don't leave out the hot details. Well, put it this way... she ate my cookies until the box was empty. Now that's what l'm talking about! l won't get with a chick if the sex ain't right! lt's all about the pussy! That's the real way to a woman's heart. True. l'm definitely gonna see her again. Well, hell yeah! You'd better see her... before someone else sees her. The Viking Killer. Very useful if you're trying to stretch him out. Does she know you're a domme? Nah. That shouldn't be a problem. She seems mad chill. l don't know, babe, usually it's only a matter of time... unless you find someone who thinks it's normal. Who would think this is normal? l do. Yeah, but eventually l wanna have a serious and normal relationship. With a girl, of course. You just need someone that's open-minded. Or a domme who understands. We are doing exactly what we want to be doing. How many people can say that? That's true, but... l don't think l'm gonna be doin' this for too much longer. l want to go back to nursing school, and l wanna have a wifey and a kid. Really? l could see that. You'd be a cute mommy. Yeah. But for now just remember, we're alternative therapists. And this is our contribution to society, right? [knock on door] lt's open! Hey, hey, hey! What's up, girl? Hi. Got some presents for you. - All right. - No. l want that one. OK. - You wanna stay? - Hell, yeah. What's up with that little dime piece you broke out with the other night? You in love yet? Shut the fuck up. You know how you lez out at lighting speed. What's up with your script? Well, y'all inspire me, so l been writin' down some new ideas. What's it about? lt's kind of a 'slice of life' thing... about being happy and an individual. ls that it? - Yeah. - Cool. l just been fuckin' around with some dialogue. What, what? That's pretty funny. But a woman wouldn't say it like that. That sounds like a dude. Do you mind? No, go ahead. That's tight. How about we change this whole scene? Yeah, l was thinkin' we should have her shit on him. They're not ready for that! No, it would be cool, 'cuz l ain't never seen that in a movie before. Yeah, there's a reason; nobody wants to see that shit. l do. - No hot lunches! - All right. Wee! Damn, girl, you crazy. [phone ringing] - Hey, sexy. - Hey, sexy. - l'll meet you by the tree... - l'll meet you by the tree. By the tree... You ready? - She's cute. - ls she? She's right there. Oh, shit, she is fly. What's up, mama? Jasmine, this is my boy, Noah. What's up, Jazzy-Jazz? lt's good. l heard a lot about you, girl. All good shit though, it's all good. All right, Noah. l'll see you later. Nice meetin' you. l'm gonna go play some handball. And l'll check you later. - Awesome. Bye. - Take care. [giggling, chatting] - Yo, Nat! - Hey! What's good, ma? Been chillin' How you doin'? l'm good, l'm good. l haven't seen you in mad long. Where you been? l'm around. Just been busy, workin' on some stuff. A'ight, l'll see you. All right. You know... l've been thinkin' about you. Yeah? Don't get offended by me asking you this... but somethin' tells me, you probably a playa, right? l mean, you seein' mad girls? No, not at all. Why? Cuz... l'd like to get to know you a little better. Really? That'd be nice. All right... l need to get this out in the open. l work in the sex industry. Yeah, like a stripper? No. Slingin' drinks? Don't tell me you're a call girl. No way. l'm a domme. Like...a dominatrix? Yeah, like a dominatrix. Wow. l mean, you don't seem like the type. What type is that? l don't know. l just imagined old German women with big tattoos and piercings. OK... Well, you gonna tie me up, spank me, and call me Shirley? Where do you find these fucking actors - in the mental home? Jesus Christ! You call yourself a casting director? l need these people in a week! [knock on door] Excuse me. Our delivery from Confidential Commodities is here. l'll call you right back. Come on in. - Hey! - What up, my brotha? You got that good shit, pretty boy? How you feelin', Mikey? ln about 30 minutes l'm going to be feeling irie. By the way... it's Michael. Watcha' got, bro? l got some good shit in from Cali. That right there is your Sweet Berry, We got the Sour Diesel... We got the Af-Gooey. And that right there is my top seller... Purple Sour O.G Kush! Hey! What did l tell you about knocking? Sorry. Can l...um, have some? Only because you look so delicious. Try the Purple Sour O.G Kush. lt'll ease whatever pain that ails you, or-- Or my money back? How about dinner? l'll let you know. Sick body, right? You should see her naked! You wouldn't know what to do with that, bro. You 'da man! Yeah? Do l get the same guarantee? l play for the home team... You know my shit is always guaranteed. Whatever. Just get the fuck out of here. Some of us have some real work to do. All right... Look, Mike... Forgive me... l know you must get this all the time, but l got this great idea for a script. Oh, great. Another script. Just what l need. lt's in the beginning stages, but l was hopin' you'd take look at it when l'm finished. Finish? lf you ever finish, it'll get thrown onto a pile with a million other scripts after a million re-writes and then some sweet-ass little intern will read it and steal your fucking idea! Look, Nomar-- Noah. l know. You're always on time and your weed's pretty good, so stick to your day job and leave the movie making to us professionals! OK, Spike Lee? OK. Success and nothin' less, my man. Yeah, whatever. Close the fucking door! Were you born in a tent? Close the door! And then it got stuck. Stuck? Up his ass. l hate stickys. He was jumping up and down and everything, but his ass just swallowed it whole. Did you try the forceps? Of course. lt was in way too deep. Birthing position? Squatting position? - Hospital? - Had to. St. Vincent's or Roosevelt? St. Vincent's... They have a lot of experience with this type of thing. OK, this is disgusting. Honey, they love it. Damn, these dudes will have you do anything they want. You got it twisted. Even if they come in for something specific, l just figure out their weakness and get them to do whatever l want. So let me get this straight. They tell you what they want, but then you don't do it? Well, every Mistress has her methods. l like to expand their horizons. You're doin' a whole lot more than expanding their horizons. They love this shit. lt sounds like you all love it. They love it! l just think we're all goddesses and men should be serving us. - Amen. - Yeah! Yeah! OK, great. l'll see you tomorrow. Thanks so much. What's up, mama? l just got an interview to possibly intern on a feature film tomorrow. Ooh! Oh, my God. l'm so happy for you. Good luck. Thanks. lf l get it, we'll have to celebrate this weekend. Well, l just hope you put some money aside, 'cuz, you know... being a domme spoils you. l mean... You are gonna make in a week what you can make in an hour doing this. That's why eventually, everyone comes back. Yeah, l know, but... l gotta try. And you are trying! That's awesome. But when you do come back, l'll be here to welcome you and tell you it's OK. l never said l was quitting... Just takin' a break. He said he wants to be mummified! What should l do?! Wrap him up in Saran Wrap. Waist up first, then the bottom half. Just remember to cut air holes for the head. Tape 'em up. Oh...OK. Thanks. Wow... You look amazing, you little shit. Thanks. lt doesn't even look like me. No, it doesn't! What are you wearing? Fetish gear. Oh, my God. Has Mommy seen this yet? Yeah. She wants a copy. So who's this new girl you're in love with? - What new girl? - Oh, c'mon. Her name is Jasmine. She's wonderful. l met her at Juicy's. Does she know what you do? Yeah. She doesn't care. Really? That's great. Hey! l got hung up at work. OK. Are you OK? Yeah. You sure? Yeah. What's up? Nothin. A'ight. You know l'm feelin' you, right? Yeah. When l met you l didn't think l'd care, but the more l'm feelin' you the more it's starting to bother me. l don't know how long l can deal with this stuff that you do. lt's fuckin' with my head. Really? Yeah. Do you like it? l mean, do you get off on it or is just your job? To be honest... it's a little of all three. Look, it's what l do. lt's what l chose to do way before l met you. l know. l'm just tryin' to be honest with you and tell you how l feel. And l want you to be honest, but don't judge me. No. no. l'm not. l think you're really creative and smart. l feel like there's so much more to you than just beating men's asses... Even though most men need their asses beat. But you know what l'm sayin'. Look, Noah's hooking me up on a job one of his customers is directing. Are you serious? Why didn't you tell me? That's what l'm talkin' about. lt's just as an intern. l'm not even hired yet. No, but you're on your way! Yes! [machine beeps] Natalie... He said he called you but you're not calling him back. What's going on? l wanna live long enough to be a great-grandmother. Why aren't you calling him back? What's good, baby girl? Noah! Thank you so much for hooking that up. - All right. - l hope l get it. We'll see if you thank me after you meet him. He's a real dickhead. Whatever, l'm sure l can handle him. All right. How bad can he be? You got somethin' new? Yeah. l was thinkin' that Natalie needs to be more vulnerable. You understand? Like, we have to have her learn something. Dude, we have to change her name. - Why? - Because that's what you do. You don't use your own name in a movie based on yourself. l wanna use my name. l'm proud of my shit. lt's unprofessional. Done. l can not wait till we get this shit in the can. l can stop sellin' weed, you could stop beatin' dudes up. l like beating dudes up. And l like selling weed. But l do see bigger and better things for us. Let me see if l can get this internship first. All right, cool. l like that. Baby steps... baby steps! You ready? Yeah, come on. Next scene. [alarm clock buzzing] Nobody should be up at this time. lt's OK, baby. l'm gonna make you breakfast. You're so cute. We gotta get up and take a shower. l'll make you some coffee and some eggs. So, are you nervous? Nah, l'm fine, kind of excited. l really appreciate you tryin'. l didn't even do anything yet. All right, l am a little bit nervous. You wanna meet me at Meow Mix for a drink later? l think l'm gonna need it. Stop trippin. You'll be fine. And yes, l'll meet you. l gotta go. Try not to start directing on your first day. Direct? Fuck that! l wanna produce! - Bye. - Knock 'em dead! Hey... Uh, do you know where l can find Omar? [chain saw revving] No! No! Cut! Cut! Cut! Cut! Who the fuck tied her up? l did. Let me try again. Sorry. Jesus Christ! No, no, no! Get outta here, you milk toast motherfucker! Jesus Christ! Doesn't anybody know how to tie a fucking knot? l could do it. Who the hell are you? l'm Natalie, a P.A. l've been bringing you coffee all day. Really? Well, sure, give it a shot. So what do you guys think? l am very impressed. And maybe you've got some other skills that we could explore. Just glad to help. Hmm, chill. She's got ambition. l like it. What do you think? Tasty cakes for sure. l will be fucking her. What the fuck? Let's shoot! Come on! All right, everyone, back to 1 ! Let's lock it up and let's roll this puppy! [chain saw revs] OK, if we could drop this one and this one, we might make it before lunch. OK, let's do it. Um, Natalie! Hey! What's up? l just wanted to thank you for what you did before. lt made a huge difference. Oh, no problem at all. l don't think we've been officially introduced. l'm Michael. lt's a pleasure to actually work with someone who makes my job easier. Most of these assholes don't know what they're doing. Thanks. lt's just fascinating watching a movie come together. What part of the business are you interested in? Writing, directing, producing - all of it! Should have known. Well, stick close to the camera. Maybe l can teach you a thing or two. OK, l will. See you tomorrow? Sure. Bright and early. Bye. You know she's total Lesbianese? So nice to lay in bed with you. At least you don't have to wake up at the crack of dawn. Yeah, now l'm gonna be getting in at the crack of dawn. We're shootin' nights this week. Damn... Let me take you to breakfast. Then we can chill in the park for a few before you go to work? l have an appointment. What kind of appointment? With a client. l thought you stopped doin' all that. Yeah, for the most part, but l kept a few regulars. Why? You know l'm interning and l'm not getting paid. This isn't about the money. Look, l told you before it's not all about the money. l'm gonna stop when l'm ready. By the time you're ready l may not be here. And you know what? l hate the fact that some random guy's jerkin' off to your fucking picture and it doesn't even bother you! lt's just a picture. Why does it bother you? l'm your fuckin' girl, that's why. Ashley! You can't be here! Really? Why? l just wanted to come visit you. This is not part of our arrangement. l've been shopping all day. l wanna show you what l bought. Ashley, l have to get back to work! No, Jim. Walk with me. l gave you my credit card. What more do you want? That's only part of it. l want to know what you think of what l bought with your hard-earned money. But Ashley, l have a board meeting. Then you better get started. Ashley, please don't do this to me. This is not cool. l really gotta go. Perhaps we should play the video of your extra-curricular activities at your board meeting. Hey, Jim. Down on one knee. Down here. Try those first. What are you waiting for, Jim? Put them on. Let's go, Jim. l don't have all day. Ooooh, l like these! What do you think, Jim? They're beautiful. You know... l think l need a woman's opinion. Excuse me. Do you mind if l ask... What do you think of these shoes? l like 'em. l think they're hot. l like 'em too. l just love shoes. They make me so happy. l guess you could say l have a little shoe fetish. Right, Jim? Now take out that next box. Not that one. The other one. Forget that for now. l've been shopping all day and l could really use a foot massage. Why are you doing this to me? Because... lt's fun. Now get to work. l put something extra in it. Thank you. That was better than l expected. l'm glad you enjoyed it. lt was fun for me, too. lt felt so real. You make it so real! Even my fantasies aren't this good. l love you! Are you in college? No. Why? What is that? lt's just a script. Oh, you're a writer? Yeah. lt's somethin' l'm working on. - l'd love to read it. - Oh, God, no. Besides, l'm not finished yet. Come on.. l'd give you my honest opinion. OK. l'll send it to you. Thanks. Enjoy. Taxi! Are you ready to be my slave? lt's your turn now, Jasmine. lt's only a a matter of time. Eventually... everyone becomes my slave. [evil laughter] Fuck! l'm goin' fuckin' crazy. [knock at door] Nobody's home! Hi! l just want to drop these off. Come in, come in. Sit down... Relax. They are taking forever to light this set, so we can talk about your career, your goals, your dreams... And what you're doin' to achieve them. Well, l want to make movies. l've been writing this script... and l want to produce films as well. Creative energy excites me. lt is exciting...sometimes. But if you wanna be a filmmaker you just gotta go for it. Don't let anything or anyone stop you. And believe me... They will try and stop you! Yeah? But...l'm sure you've heard all this before. Well, yeah, but l asked you, right? l'm interested in what you're doing. You're...smart. So you're writing a screenplay? Yeah... Maybe when you get a minute, you could take a look, give us some notes? Sure, sure. What am l here for? When you're finished, drop off a copy for me. Well... l'm impressed. You're really on top of your shit. Well, l'm a fast learner. Trust me - When l put my mind to something... l usually get what l want. You know...l think that you will have no trouble working your way up in this business. ln fact, l might be able to help you. Maybe we can help each other, if you know what l mean. l think l do. ls that what you want, Michael? Actually, yes. That is what l want. Well, l gotta warn you. l'm a real...naughty girl. Yeah... l like naughty girls. l bet you do. So... Have you ever been tied up? No, but l've tied a bunch of girls up. l love being in control. lt makes me hot. Yeah? Whatever turns you on, sweetie. This is getting me so fucking excited. Yeah? Are your panties getting wet? Fuck! You are good. l really can't move here, sweetie. Good. l want you completely helpless. l wanna fuck the shit out of you. And l want you to shut the fuck up. l have a special surprise for you. l want you to feel as hot as l do. Do you want to fuck me, Michael? Uh huh... You wish. You see... You've been a bad boy. And bad boys have to be punished, Michael. And l want you to know... what you have coming to you. First l'm gonna start with your balls, and l'm gonna tie 'em up real tight. And then l'm gonna whip your ass until you're crying like a little bitch! Then l'm gonna spit in your face, and pee right in your mouth. That's right, Michael. l'm gonna make you drink me. l'm gonna show you what a real bad girl does to a bad boy! l don't think you're ready for this. Hey, Michael, Miley said-- What the fuck are you doin'? Can we get some scissors for him in here, please? Fuck! Tell that fuckin', crazy bitch that she is never allowed on my set again! Come on, sleepy head, Get up! Stop. l'm sleeping and l have a hangover. See? You were totally the designated drunk last night. l told you to slow your ass down. Wake up. You gotta get up for work. l got downsized. We can cuddle all day. Downsized? How does an intern get downsized? What happened? All right... l got fired. Fired? For what? What did you do? What did l do? Why do you immediately think it was my fault? Look... lt's complicated, OK? Me and the director, who is a complete fucking asshole, had a big misunderstanding. l'm not surprised... You stomp around like you're the Queen of the City and whatever you say goes and that's that! ls that how you see me? Yeah... Well, sometimes. lt's just your energy. Jazzy, you're not makin' any sense. l thought this was gonna work when you got that new job. Obviously it's not. You'll probably just go back and do that same shit again, right? But l never stopped. What l do has no reflection on how l feel about you. l have to share you with all these perverts and freaks looking at you, droolin' all over you. lt's bad enough the shit we gotta go through day to day as lesbians in this city, and you invite that shit. You don't have to share me with anybody! And the crazy thing is you like that shit! l see how much you love it. l see how much your eyes light up when you talk about it. You try and find a girl who's gonna love you and deal with this shit. l'm sorry... lt's givin' me nightmares. What do you want me to do? lt doesn't even matter. lt's who you are... lt's what you are. Sorry, l'm scared of all this dominatrix shit. l don't wanna get caught up in it. l don't know what to say. - Hey. - Hey. Hey! Hey what? Are you all right? Yeah, l'm fine. OK... Well, um... l was on the subway and there was this really hot guy-- Jazz and l got into another fight. l'm sorry. What was that about the subway guy? Oh, nothing. Your girlfriend troubles trump my almost getting picked up by a blue-eyed hottie. lt just keeps happening. lt's crazy. Well, are you doing anything different? What do you mean? Well, some people might think that the definition of crazy is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results. What? Didn't Mommy say that? Oh, shit. Oh, fuck, l'm quoting Mommy? Am l becoming Mommy? Yeah... The transformation has begun. My life is over. Oh, God... Holy shit. Hey, sis. Are you all right? Yeah, l'm fine. Mommy says you're depressed. Ma! Why are you telling everyone l'm depressed? Rebecca's not everyone. And you're all emotional. Emotional? Me and my girlfriend just broke up. Of course l'm emotional. Don't you think you're being overly sensitive? No, l think you're being a little insensitive. lt's just because we care about you. The right person will love you for who you are. l know. She wasn't right for you anyway. How do you know? She was just a little too normal for you. l liked her for me. Natalie, your hair looks really pretty. Why don't you leave it down today? Enough with the hair thing, Ma. ls there some fetish we should know about? What's your fascination with our hair? [all laughing] No, no, no. l just want you guys to be healthy and happy. l am happy... l'm just tryin' to find myself. You'll find yourself. The important thing to use your passion to define your place in this world. [knocking at door] - Hey, Noah. - Are you all right? How did you know? Melanie told me. lt's just stupid. Everything's so stupid. l know. lt's gonna be all right. l got you. You're gonna bounce back. You're the motherfuckin' queen bee, the bad girl extraordinaire! C'mon now. Bad girl... The job, the relationship, the director. Bad, bad, bad. You're right... l am the bad girl extraordinaire, but not in a good way. Come here... ln times like these, there's only two things you can turn to - Friends... And of course... da ganja, mon. Come on. l'm so upset right now l don't even wanna smoke. Come on, girl! Get the fuck outta here! Last week we were like Cheech and Chong in this muthafucker! l can't even focus. You got a bad case of girl drama, which means you're gonna forget about this shit in a week. Now come on. All right. Here we go... l gave him a copy of the script. You did? Can't have our shit out there all unfinished... l'll get our shit back. Even if l have to beat his ass, l will get our shit back. You gonna get all gansta on his ass? l will haunt that motherfucker like the soul of a child molester. [phone rings] That's probably my grandmother. Natalie! lt's me, Michael. Hey... Look...l, uh... l really need to speak to you about-- Holy shit! Michael as in dickhead Michael? [phone rings] Natalie, it's me again. Look... lf you're there, pick up. l really need to talk to you-- Damn, you got him sprung like that? Tell me what happened. Well, your boy was gettin' all nasty with me, and l had to show him what nasty really is. What the fuck you do? [phone rings] What the fuck? Are you there? Please, l'm begging you... Pick up the phone, please-- Damn, ma. How the fuck did he get my number? Let's get to work. Please, please, please. - Hey. - Hey! l miss you guys so much. l don't even remember the last time we all hung out since l left the dungeon. - Do you? - Nope. Since y'all are my best friends, and my sisters, l want you to be the first to know... l'm pregnant! What? - Are you serious - Really? Wow! You really did it? That is so cool. Can l just... Oh, my God! You are going to be a great mother. How do you feel? Like l went to rehab... For real! l never thought l'd hear that out of your mouth. Well, there comes a point in life where you must grow up and leave certain things behind. l'm happy for you. What's up with you, Mel? l'm still doing my thing. l have a ton of regular clients. And l'm dating this guy, and guess what? He loves that l'm a domme. l mean, l think he's really kind of into it. l've been having an amazing time. What about you, Nat? l kept a couple of regulars. But me and Noah are busy with our script. Oh, and how is that going? The film business is rough, but l love it! Do you all wanna get some ices? - Yes! - Yeah, yeah, yeah! l wanna go first! What are you doing with your script? l'm not sure what the next step is, except getting it produced. l have to find someone who believes in it... and believes in me. Well, l believe in you. l care about you and l want to help you. That's sweet. Thank you. No, l'm serious. l'm a good businessman and l know people. But l don't know anything about film. lf you can find a hotshot director... l'll back it. Just leave all the finances up to me. Really? You'd do that for me? l'd do anything for you, Mistress. Psst... My real name's Natalie. Natalie! Hey, um... We need to talk. Michael, what the fuck are you doing here? Are you stalking me? No! l-l just... l needed to see you. What do you want, Michael? You did something to me. You unlocked something in me l didn't know existed. Something l can't control. You know me... l gotta control everything. Yeah, you're an asshole. lf we could just... lf l could just spend some time with you... Maybe we can work something out? Sure... We can work somethin' out. Step into my office. Somebody will be here shortly to prepare you for your Mistress. Hi. l've been thinking about what you said about me not being ready... And you were right. But l'm ready now. Oh, really? Ready for what? Ready to do whatever l... Ready to do whatever you want me to do. OK. The first thing l want you to do... My Normal, by Natalie Lawna and Noah Cohen. Scene One. James, a middle-aged man dressed in a suit sits behind a desk shuffling papers. He shakes his head and mutters... We have a very big problem here, girls. Girls, we have a very big problem. We have a very big problem, girls. Girls, we have a very big problem. How big is our problem? [dialogue continues and fades] Ashtray. What have l done? Marker. You don't even know! Hi. Tell us a little bit about your character. My character is, l guess, the gimp... the ashtray. He's the bitch of the main character and he's only there as a receptacle for her garbage. Can you tell me your name and what you do? My name is Storm, and l'm a physical therapist.
