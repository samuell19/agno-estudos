But what's the rate? I'm giving you the best rate, Sir. Only 1500 rupees. Room service, hot water, satellite TV all included. Come, sir. Their hotel has Indian style toilets, Ma'am.

You won't find such a view anywhere else. Sir, 1200. Let's close it at 800. Okay ma'am, 800 is fine by us. Their hotel is next to the road. You'll hear noisy traffic all night. Sir, let's settle at 1000. 500, ma'am. We'll pay you 800, take it or leave it. Be reasonable, ma'am. 800 is unfeasible. Let's do this. Let's finalize it at 1000, no extra taxes! How far is it? - Not too far, ma'am. What's this, sister? What will you even earn from 500? Carry on, then. Swati... Let's take a selfie here. ...India will be space superpower in 72 hours. While congratulating the scientists Prime Minister said... Now India will be counted among world's superpowers. Where are you coming from? - Bus stand. I'll get you some water. Who brought these chickens? Your father brought them. Where is he? Didi, I'm asking you... where is he? He's in the greenhouse. UTTRAKHAND GOVT ANNOUNCES POULTRY FARM SUBSIDY Where are my pants? Why would I hide them? Put on the towel. You look like a cartoon character. What the fuck is this?!! Do you think I'm a joke?!! Did I get hens for you to cook them? Is it a crime to earn two pennies? Two pennies? Like when you started the greenhouse? It was you who cursed that! "Who'll buy broccoli and zucchini?" you said. Even when I opened that tea-shop, you kept nagging me! I'm fucking fed up. Sir, we have chicken curry on the menu tonight. I know. We ordered it. It's tasty. But don't slaughter any more! That land! Let's sell the greenhouse land. We can start the road with the money. How can you say that, Chandra? It's our ancestral land. We'll be cursed! Who will buy it? It won't fetch anything. I have saved some money. It will all add up. How much money do you have? Tell me! I slog all day. We've barely got enough for the doctor. What will the doctor do? Only our deity can help now. You, your deity and your sister! What does my sister have to do with this?! You are up-in-arms as soon as I mention your sister. Don't you see me working like a mule? Should I give you body pressing massage? Haven't you pressed me enough? I like big butts and I cannot lie. I like big butts and I cannot lie. I couldn't find the other torch. How did you learn this? Use those brains on your studies too, yeah? Let's go. The moment for which the whole country was waiting for 500 years... ...that moment has arrived. Prime Minister is visiting Ayodhya for the inaugural ceremony of Ram Temple. The way Ayodhya welcomed god Ram. What are you doing Prakash? Just like that, Ayodhya is eager to welcome the Prime Minister today. Look, just start okay? Don't make a fuss. Okay? Please... Yes. That's right. Now don't throw a tantrum on the way or she'll get mad. Protect my dignity! Keep it here. Don't move it. Okay? Is the BMD okay? Okay, sir. Lift your leg, son. Lift it. Lift it, son! Can't lift it? It's been 5 months and you still can't move your leg! Let's see. Does it hurt? - It tickles. It tickles? Wow... Which grade are you in? 6th. Okay! Grade 6, well done. Okay, so grade 6. Tell me something. Do you like Math? English? Do you like English? No? Are you scared of your teacher? No? Okay, then. Let's try to stand up. Okay? Come on! Very good, try! Let's try it once. Stand up. Stand! STAND UP! Stand! STAND UP! You won't get up? Give me the machine. Let's chop off your legs! Okay? Should I cut them off? Should I?! Yeah? Should I cut them off? Doctor Sahib? If the reports are fine then why is he not walking? There is no defect in his legs. It's a mental block. Counselling will be able to diagnose the problem. You'll have to bring him three times a week. For 2 more months. Okay? I lost count. Doctor Sahib, I know what the problem is. What? Our family-deity is upset. Deity? Don't you see it? He prescribes a new test every time. You're talking nonsense. Doctor, please make him understand. If the village had a road I would've brought Prakash every day. He would've been running by now! My husband is obsessed with doing the Jagar ceremony. My sister's widowed. Our son can't walk. And you just want to blow all our money! Here. Dharam! We're just friends. You understand that, right? There's nothing more between us. Run! Where's Papa? What did the doctor say? I came first again and won this in a bet. If there's anything between you and that boy... I've been topping the class for four years now. You don't see that! All you see is chocolate! So what? Should I shout this from the rooftops? Why can't you teach Prakash instead of mucking around with boys? Can he go to school in his state? As if he was winning laurels when he could walk! Prakash, if you aren't watching (TV), then switch it off. I'm talking to you Prakash. Damn it! Are you deaf now? Give me the remote, Prakash! Give it to me! I will show your Tuk Tuk video to mom. At least put a 't' in Switzerland! Sister... Let me pay you. India is growing at fast speed. Every village has a road. Every house has electricity and a toilet. Soon, India will be among the developed countries. What previous governments didn't achieve in 70 years... Will be done in 10 years. After winning the elections with big margin... ... Amit Mehta has been selected as road and transportation minister of the state. Day after, he is visiting his constituency... ... Munsiyari is called Switzerland of Uttarakhand. Looks stunning during this time of the year. One can see the Himalayas almost every day. Amit Mehta will spend two days in Munsiyari. Then he will be visiting Pithoragarh. Where a grand reception is waiting for him. Now, let's move towards international news. Russian President Putin said... - Hi sissy! - Mummy! Dork! Mummy! Oh Mummy! Where are you? Do you remember? Do you remember? Cripple... Where is your Mummy? Who were they? I've been saying it for so long... 25000 each and we could finally get this road built. If I had that kind of money, I'd remarry! Why don't you tell the Village Chief? The board announcing the road has been there for 4 years now. You think he cares? That cripple's hotel is on the road. He charges 1500 a day. If we built the road together, we could also raise our rentals. We don't even earn 800 currently. Okay enough chit-chat now. Let's head home. Shit. Guru, help me. Had your grandmother not told you to do Jagar? No, Guru. She never said anything. I can see that she told you. Really? Okay, then I will make some arrangements. Arrangements? Okay. I'll make you some sacred ash. Okay. Do you drink? No Guru. - Sure? I don't drink. - I am giving you sacred ash. - Okay. After the prayer, put some on your boy and some on you. - Okay. - Understood? Yes. The sacred ash will take care of all your problems until you do the Jagar. - Okay. - Good. - Pray to your clan deity. - I am poor man, don't have much. Put it there. - I will take your leave Guru. - Sure. - Thank you. - Live long. Hey! Leave him! Who left the door unlatched? The dog got out. Are you addicted to sweets now too? What are you doing? Are you crazy? Obviously someone ate them. Chandra! It could've been you! Why would I steal from my own house? I forgot that this isn't my house! My doggie died last week as well. Sugar-free came under a car. Sugar-free? His name was Sugar-free. Strange name. My grandfather named him. He is a huge fan of Amitabh Bachchan. Named the dog after his film. How did this happen? I'll think about meeting you. If you confess your feelings... What does Kanchan do all day? She's quite odd. She knows nothing apart from Tuk Tuk videos. She's weird. Neeraj, where's your Dad? Papa! Someone's here to see you. "Aha, fuck me harder." - Papa! - Who is it? Kanchan's mother. Send her up. Hi! Be careful. What brings you here? I heard on the radio that the minister is coming. Please get work started on the road. The work will begin soon. Have a seat. Come on. Sit with me. Did you hurt your leg? You should have pulled up your saree. Show me... show. You know our minister ji ... He always listens to me. I got the cable TV contract thanks to him! Understood? So why don't you ask him to get the road built? Let me see. I was a doctor's assistant for five years. It's turning red. It's not a fracture, right? It's government work. It requires special attention. Everything comes at a price... Even cow-dung! Here. Love is not a game. Don't make a farce of it. That is why I hide my tears. You have no idea. Cheers! - Cheers! Sir! Put on a dance number? Which one? Something racy! Shall we? What happened Dharam? No... No... Forgive me! Grandma! I'm sorry, I've made a mistake! I've made a mistake! Forgive me... What happened? Have water. Drink up. What happened? Who are you talking to? Didi! We've made a terrible mistake! Grandma was here... she was here! You were jumping around choking yourself... 'Grandma!'... How much did you drink? Prakash! Kanchan! Sister. Give it to him. I will do Jagar when I have money. For time being, please accept this gift. Hail Goddess! Hail Goddess! Hail Goddess! Panditji... Mark her forehead. Chandra! Pankaj Nautial will read the news for you. News in detail. Prime Minister reached Manali last night. According to reliable sources he has left for Rohtang. He will reach here soon. This tunnel is an example of excellence in engineering in India. It's a historical moment. Today, the Prime Minister will gift this tunnel to the nation. Prime Minister has reached here. Let me see. Let me see. What happened? Is your stomach upset? Don't worry! The road work will start on Saturday. I'm getting it done. Then you can go to hospital comfortably! Kanchan. It's late, go to bed. - Two more pages. - No, go now. I'll finish these two pages and go. You are drunk again. You are so lovable when you're sober. So? Do you study at home or just watch TV? Here. Speak up. Kanchan taught you, didn't she? What are you staring at? Look up and answer the question. Look, he is weak in all subjects. He doesn't know English. You can't bring him to school. He doesn't send in his homework. Please give us some time. How much time do you want? It's already been 5 months. One month. The road will also be ready by then. Three days. Okay. I'll bring him to school from Saturday. How do you know that the road will be built in a month? I told you, the government is getting it done. It hasn't been built in four years, now it'll be done in a month? Have you gone crazy? Where did you hear it from? I heard it from women in the village. Which women? Prakash? Prakash?! Is there something you want to tell me? Yay, Papa... our team won! We have to go to Delhi next week, for the national quiz competition! Bless you, my dear! Come, sit. Have some chowmein. Not chowmein, hakka noodles! Brother, one plate hakka noodles. Look, Ma. You're not going to Delhi. You look after the house. I'll take Prakash to school. Your father has no time to take him. When did I say I don't have time? We have to do the Jagar. Where will we get the money for that? - Please, Ma! - Enough of fun and games for you! It's a New Year card, Papa. You've gone mad. You want her to be uneducated like my sister? Done? Happy now? Let's go. Let's go. Come on! Chandra! Will you go to the market today? I've run out of my medicines. Ask your ancestors to get them. - Move. - Give that to me. - Leave it. - Leave. Move. Let go. Leave it! Why are you interfering? Why shouldn't I? Isn't this my brother's house? - Leave it. - You leave it! Leave! Leave! Guru... I have sacrificed a goat but my troubles are still increasing. I can do the Jagar in 6 months. What more can I do for the house? Glory to God! You are talking about the house? Your wife doesn't want the Jagar! Do you need her permission? Who's the boss of this house, you or your wife? Eh! I am, Sir. Then rein her in! How dare she defy you! How dare she obstruct the ritual? Tell me! You walk north, she goes south! Leave... Go. Papa, no... Papa... I'll clobber you with this... Don't try my patience! Papa open the door. Kanchan! Hit me, if you're a man! Tell me where the money is. I won't give you a penny! I'll fuck you up... Where's the money! Hit me, if you ain't the son of a whore! Papa... Leave me. - Go to hell... - Leave me! - Both you and your sister! - Leave me. You want money? Want to do your Jagar? You'll dance too? I'd rather die than give you a penny. Leave me! Leopard on the loose! Leopard on the loose! Leopard on the loose! Chandra! Papa, where's Aunty? Leopard on the loose! Check the bathroom. Leopard on the loose! Leopard on the loose! Didi! Didi! Didi! Didi! She's not here. Didi! - Kamla! Didi! - Aunty! Kamla! You sleep! Didi! - Kamla! Okay Sir. Yes. That's right. Okay Sir. Brother... The forest department says there is no man-eating leopard here. Not in the entire Kumaon region. What now? Now, as in? How can we find her? Brother... People are saying you guys didn't get along. Every family has issues. Your fights can be heard in our house! Chandra! Sister... she was a widow. And... ...you didn't get along with her. You must have said something... That's why she left. Am I not right, brother? Now, go home. As soon as we get an update, I'll inform you. What's the matter? Want a slap? - Sir, have you seen her anywhere? - No. Please see. - Haven't seen her. - You haven't? Sir, have you seen this lady? - Goodbye. - Goodbye son. Okay, sister. Thank you so much. We had a really nice trip. Okay... Goodbye, Sir. No Aunty... We've been to the police station already. I'm at the taxi stand now. We haven't found out anything. Aunty, I'll speak to you later.

Dharam! - Step down. - Fuck off! I'm the boss of this house, got it!? I'm your husband, not your slave! I had such high hopes for you. And this is how you behave! Two thousand for firewood! I'm not asking for sandalwood, man! It's 800 for a quintal, right? Let's settle at 1000! Will you have tea? I'll get you milk with turmeric. Put your hands down. Keep your feet straight.

She's called me ten times since morning! 'Prime Minister Village Roads Plan' After eating chowmein, we'll go hiking in the forest. - Yes. We'll butcher a hen in there. - I don't eat chicken. You don't? Hey sister! The kids took Prakash to the other field. I eat paneer, not chicken. So, you don't eat chicken. Where are you looking at? Look up at me! Stop crying, you pussy! Get up!
