HERE'S OUR STOP. COME ON. THIS TIME NEXT WEEK: CALIFORNIA. YOU EXCITED? UH-HUH. ME, TOO. I CAN'T WAIT. WERE YOU EVER THERE? ONCE, FOR SIX WEEKS, TOURING WITH SOME MUSICAL. IN THE MIDDLE OF DECEMBER WE WENT SWIMMING. WHICH MUSICAL? WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE? I'M TRYING TO TELL YOU HOW BEAUTIFUL IT'S GOING TO BE. WE'LL FIND A HOUSE IN THE HILLS. NEAR THE MOVIE STUDIOS? YES. YOUR WINDOW WILL FACE WARNER BROTHERS. YOU CAN WATCH THEM BLOW UP THE WORLD FROM YOUR BED. CAN YOU IMAGINE YOUR VERY OWN ORANGE TREE? THE MUSICAL WAS FIDDLER ON THE ROOF. I WAS 4 1/2. YOU WERE NEVER 4 1/2. YOU WERE BORN 26. WILL I BE IN THE SAME GRADE? OF COURSE. EVERYTHING'S THE SAME THERE, ONLY IT'S THREE HOURS EARLIER. YOU'LL GRADUATE YOUNGER. A GIRL I KNOW FROM CALIFORNIA KNOWS HELEN REDDY'S DAUGHTER. AFTER THIS PICTURE, THEY'LL SAY, THERE GOES TONY DeFOREST'S DAUGHTER. BUT HE'S NOT A STAR. HE'S JUST AN ACTOR. STARS HAVE TO BE ACTORS FIRST. HE'S NOT MY FATHER. YOU'RE SUCH A STICKLER FOR DETAILS. CAN I SHOW TONY MY THINGS? LATER. YOU HAVE HOMEWORK. WE'RE MOVING IN FOUR DAYS. SUPPOSE BETWEEN NOW AND FRIDAY, THEY TEACH BRAIN SURGERY. WOULDN'T WANT YOU TO MISS IT. WE HAD IT LAST WEEK IN SCIENCE. ARE YOU SERIOUS? DUMB. YOU'RE DUMB. I THOUGHT MAYBE IN FROG DISSECTION. CAN I JUST SHOW HIM MY NEW SWEATER? OH, ALRIGHT. BUT WASH YOUR FACE AND BRUSH YOUR HAIR AND NO MAKE-UP. TONY! SWEETHEART? YOU IN THE BATHROOM? HEY, WE CLEANED OUT ALEXANDER'S! WE BOUGHT EVERYTHING ON SALE. YOU BETTER LIKE IT BECAUSE WE CAN'T EXCHANGE IT. I BOUGHT YOU A PRESENT. BABE? COME OUT AND SEE. BABE? TONY? OH. OH, MY GOD! WHAT HAPPENED? HE'S...GONE. HE LEFT WITHOUT US. FOR CALIFORNIA? FOR ITALY. HUH? CAN I READ IT? "DEAR PAULA, THIS ISN'T AN EASY LETTER TO WRITE." IT DOESN'T START OFF TOO GOOD. "WHERE IN THE HELL DO I BEGIN? YOU AND THE KID MEAN A LOT TO ME." THE KID? "I TURNED DOWN THE JOB IN L.A. IT WAS A LOUSY TV PICTURE. "ON MONDAY, STAN FIELDS CALLED. "I GOT THE BERTO.. BERTOLUCCI. "BERTOLUCCI PICTURE. WHO'S BERTOLUCCI? AN ITALIAN DIRECTOR. WHAT DID HE DIRECT? WHAT ARE YOU ASKING QUESTIONS LIKE THAT NOW FOR? "IT'S SIX MONTHS' SHOOTING IN SPAIN AND ITALY. "IT'S A HELL OF A PART, I WANT IT. I BROKE MY ASS-- AH! GIVE ME THAT. ASS. HEARD THE WORD BEFORE. "I BROKE MY ASS FOR 12 YEARS. "THINGS ARE FINALLY BEGINNING TO BREAK FOR ME. "I TOLD YOU WHEN WE FIRST MOVED IN HERE, "THAT IT WAS NEVER GOING TO BE PERMANENT. CHRIST. I'M NOT EVEN DIVORCED FROM PATTY YET." WHO'S PATTY? I TOLD YOU ABOUT HER. NO, YOU DIDN'T. WELL, I THOUGHT YOU'D BE UPSET IF YOU KNEW YOU WERE LIVING WITH A MARRIED MAN. I WASN'T. YOU WERE. I WAS IN THE NEXT ROOM. WELL, THEY WERE PRACTICALLY DIVORCED. "I LEFT EARLY TODAY BECAUSE I DIDN'T WANT A GOOD-BYE SCENE. THIS IS ONE OF THE WORST LETTERS I'VE EVER READ IN MY WHOLE LIFE. ISN'T IT TERRIBLE? OH! "I WISH I HAD SOMETHING TO LEAVE YOU AND THE KID." HE DIDN'T LEAVE US ANYTHING? NO. "HAD TO SELL MY WATCH AND CAMERA TO PAY OFF THE LOAN SHARKS." HE OWED MONEY TO SHARKS? I'LL EXPLAIN IT SOME OTHER TIME. "YOU'LL BE ALRIGHT. YOU CAN GO BACK TO DANCING." DANCING? I'M 33. I CAN HARDLY WALK ANYMORE. "I WISH BOTH OF US ALL THE LUCK IN THE WORLD. LOVE TO THE KID." DON'T READ ANY MORE. THERE'S JUST ONE MORE WORD. "TONY." OH, THROW IT AWAY. DOES THIS MEAN WE'RE NOT GOING TO CALIFORNIA? YEAH. THAT MEANS I HAVE TO DO MY HOMEWORK, RIGHT? OH, LUCY. AND 5 AND 6 AND 7 AND 8 AND 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16. 1 AND 2, 3, AND 4 AND OVER. 2, 3, AND 4. I SEE YOU, PAULA. YOU CAN'T HIDE FROM ME. DOWN, UP, AND OVER. 2, 3, 4. ONCE AGAIN. MY GOD. WHAT HAVE YOU DONE TO YOUR BODY? IT DIED. HAVE A LITTLE RESPECT. ONCE AGAIN. AND 1, 2, 3, AND COME ON, PAULA. PUSH. 2, 3, AND 4 AND.. PAULA? DONNA. DONNA DOUGLAS. I WORKED WITH YOU IN COMPANY.

WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT? WE'RE PAID UP THROUGH JUNE. WE HAVE THREE MORE MONTHS. YOU CAN'T SUBLET THAT APARTMENT. I'M NOT. YOUR YOUNG MAN DID. HE SUBLET OUR APARTMENT? HE NOTIFIED ME LAST NIGHT. HIS NAME WAS ON THE LEASE, HE COULD DO WHAT HE WANTS. YOU LEAVE IT LIKE YOU FOUND IT. I'M NOT LEAVING IT. I CLEANED AND PAINTED AND DECORATED IT. IT'S MINE. I'M NOT GETTING OUT. DO YOU UNDERSTAND? THAT'S NONE OF MY BUSINESS, HONEY. YOU CAN TAKE THAT UP WITH THE SUBLETEE. I JUST DON'T WANT NO TROUBLE IN MY BUILDING. OH, THAT...BASTARD! THAT NO-GOOD BASTARD. MM-HMM. WHO'S THAT? I DON'T KNOW. MAYBE IT'S TONY. MAYBE HE CHANGED HIS MIND AND CAME BACK. YOU'RE SO YOUNG. STAY THERE. WHO IS IT? ELLIOT GARFIELD. WHO? ELLIOT GARFIELD FROM CHICAGO. IS TONY IN? THERE'S NOBODY BY THAT NAME HERE. WAIT A SECOND. WAIT A SECOND. 3-A. IT'S THE RIGHT APARTMENT. I WAS HERE ONCE TWO YEARS AGO. I DON'T CARE. THERE'S NO WHAT'S-HIS-NAME HERE. COULD YOU OPEN THE DOOR FOR ONE SECOND? NOT AT 12:05. OH, JESUS. YOU GOT A LATCH. KEEP IT ON. I'LL JUST TALK FOR ONE SECOND. MAKE IT FAST. MY HUSBAND IS SLEEPING. I THINK THERE'S BEEN SOME KINDA MISTAKE. I SUBLET THIS APARTMENT FROM A FRIEND, TONY DeFOREST. HE LIVES HERE. THAT'LL BE NEWS TO MY HUSBAND CHARLIE. I HAVE A RECEIPT FOR THREE MONTHS' RENT. I WAS SUPPOSED TO ARRIVE TOMORROW, BUT I CAME IN EARLY BECAUSE I'M STARTING WORK IN THE MORNING. I FIGURED I COULD SPEND THE NIGHT HERE. SEE. YOU LOOK CONFUSED. CAN I TALK TO YOUR HUSBAND? HE'LL BE AT THE 37th PRECINCT AT 9 IN THE MORNING. CHARLIE DAGASTINO, HOMICIDE. GOODNIGHT. WHO WAS IT? NEVER MIND. DIDN'T SOUND LIKE A "NEVER MIND" TO ME. TONY RENTED THE APARTMENT TO SOMEONE, BUT I'M NOT GIVING IT UP. IT'S OURS. GO TO SLEEP. HE RENTED THE APARTMENT? WE HAVE TO LEAVE? OVER MY DEAD BODY. WHAT IF THEY FORCE US? LET 'EM TRY. GO TO SLEEP. HE RENTED THE APARTMENT. WHAT A SHITHEAD. HELLO. IS TONY THERE PLEASE? WHO'S CALLING? I WAS JUST UP THERE. I RECOGNIZE YOUR VOICE, MRS. DAGASTINO. MRS. WHO? DAGASTINO. HOW COME YOUR TELEPHONE ANSWERS TO TONY DeFOREST'S NUMBER? AND HOW COME THE KEY HE SENT ME, AIR MAIL SPECIAL DELIVERY, OPENS YOUR DOOR, HUH? HUH? YOU WANT TO ANSWER THOSE QUESTIONS, MRS. DAGASTINO? NO! WHY DON'T YOU ANSWER THEM? I THINK THE ANSWER IS SOMETHING FISHY IS GOING ON. I'M WET AS A HERRING, WHATEVER YOUR NAME IS. AND I DON'T HAVE A PLACE TO SLEEP TONIGHT. AND I DON'T WANT TO BLOW MY LAST FEW BUCKS ON A HOTEL. ACCORDING TO MY NONWATERPROOF WATCH, IT'S AT LEAST 12:20. AND TECHNICALLY, THAT APARTMENT BELONGS TO ME. DO I COME UP THERE NOW AND WE DISCUSS THIS AMICABLY OR DO I STORM THE PLACE IN THE MORNING? I'VE GOT A GUN. I'LL USE IT IF I HAVE TO. CHANGE? GOT CHANGE FOR A DOLLAR? I GOT A PREGNANT WIFE IN THE LOBBY! I JUST WANT CHA-- WE'RE IN TROUBLE, RIGHT? WE'RE NOT IN TROUBLE. WE HAVE OUR RIGHTS. POSSESSION IS 9/10ths OF LAW. WHAT'S THE OTHER 10th? SHUT UP. IS THAT THE LAST 10th? GO TO BED. I WILL HANDLE THIS. HELLO. JUST CALLED THE 37th PRECINCT. THERE'S NO CHARLES DAGASTINO. THEN I CALLED RITA SCOTT, AN OLD ACTRESS FRIEND OF MINE. WHO WAS IN MERCHANT OF VENICE THIS YEAR WITH TONY DeFOREST. RITA TOLD ME ALL ABOUT THIS GIRL TONY'S LIVING WITH. A CERTAIN PAULA MCFADDEN AND HER TEN-YEAR-OLD DAUGHTER, LUCY. SHE ALSO TOLD ME THE APARTMENT IS LEASED TO TONY DeFOREST. SHE KNOWS THIS FOR A FACT. SHE USED TO LIVE WITH HIM. CAN WE CONTINUE THIS CONVERSATION IN A DRIER ROOM? YOU GOT PROBLEMS? TAKE IT UP WITH THE HOUSING AUTHORITY. DON'T HANG UP! PLEASE. I DON'T HAVE ANY MORE CHANGE. I'M SOAKED, AND I HAVE A LOW THRESHOLD FOR DISEASE. TONY'S GOT MY MONEY, AND I GOT A LEASE, YOU GOT THE APARTMENT. NOW ONE OF US GOT SCREWED. UH, LET ME REPHRASE THAT. WE HAVE TO TALK THIS OUT. I'M IN NO CONDITION, FINANCIAL OR HEALTHWISE, TO LOOK FOR A HOTEL IN THE RAIN. IF THERE'S ANYTHING LIKE THE 78th-STREET FLU, I'VE GOT IT. TAKE A SHOT IN A CONVENIENT PLACE. FIVE MINUTES! THAT'S ALL I'M ASKING. WHAT IS IT? IN ABOUT 30 SECONDS, WE'RE GOING TO GET CUT OFF. MY NUMBER IS 873-5261. IT'S A FLOODED BOOTH ON AMSTERDAM AVENUE. IF YOU HAVE ANY COMPASSION IN YOUR HEART WHATSOEVER-- I'M TRYING TO WORK IT OUT, OPERATOR! CALL ME BACK. 873-5261. THAT NUMBER AGAIN-- OH, SHIT! HELLO. THANK YOU. FIVE MINUTES. LEAVE YOUR BAGS. THIS ISN'T A PERMANENT CONVERSATION. I'M DRIPPING ON YOUR RUG. IT'S BEEN DRIPPED ON BEFORE. I'M SORRY' BOUT THIS. I DIDN'T KNOW THERE WERE COMPLICATIONS. THERE'S A LOT OF THAT AROUND. I DON'T BLAME YOU FOR BEING HOSTILE, I GET THE PICTURE. TONY RENTED ME THE APARTMENT AND SPLIT. THEN YOU AND YOUR DAUGHTER GOT DUMPED ON. YOUR VERSION. MY VERSION IS WE AMICABLY ENDED OUR RELATIONSHIP. WE AGREED I WOULD KEEP THE APARTMENT. YOU AND YOUR $600 GOT DUMPED ON. GET THE PICTURE. VERY SHARP. SHARP. YOU'RE A SHARP NEW YORK GIRL, RIGHT? NO, A DULL CINCINNATI KID. BUT YOU GET DUMPED ON ENOUGH, YOU DEVELOP AN EDGE. OKAY. SO WHAT'S THE DEAL? I GOT A LEASE HERE IN MY POCKET. YOU GOING TO HONOR IT? I GOT A DAUGHTER IN MY BED THAT TOPS A LEASE. I DON'T WANT TO GET LEGAL. LEGAL HAPPENS TO BE ON MY SIDE. I HAPPEN TO HAVE A LAWYER ACQUAINTANCE DOWNTOWN. ALL I GOTTA DO IS CALL HIM. OH! WOAH, WOAH. WHAT? AN ACTOR...ANOTHER GODDAMN ACTOR. "I HAPPEN TO HAVE A LAWYER ACQUAINTANCE?" RIGHT OUT OF STREETCAR NAMED DESIRE. STANLEY KOWALSKI IN SUMMER STOCK. RIGHT? WRONG. CHICAGO IN WINTER. 3 1/2 MONTHS AT DRURY LANE THEATER. ASK AN ACTOR A QUESTION, HE GIVES YOU HIS CREDITS. WANNA HEAR REVIEWS, "ELLIOT GARFIELD BRINGS TO KOWALSKI DIMENSIONS THAT EVEN BRANDO HAD NOT INVESTIGATED." TERRIFIC, YOU WRITE BEAUTIFULLY. AREN'T YOU TOO SHORT TO PLAY STANLEY? NOBODY NOTICED I STOOD ON THE POKER TABLE. ARE YOU A CRITIC? NO, I LOVE ACTORS. AS LONG AS THEY STAY ON STAGE. PUT THEM IN REAL LIFE, AND THE WORLD GETS SCREWED UP. I HAVE HAD ENOUGH. I AM NOT GETTING KICKED OUT OF THE SAME LOUSY APARTMENT TWICE. YOU WANT YOUR MONEY BACK, GO TO NAPLES. YOU WANT THIS APARTMENT, BUY ME TWO TICKETS TO CALIFORNIA. I'LL GIVE TWO MINUTES TO THINK IT OVER BEFORE I YELL RAPE. YOU ARE REALLY SOMETHING, YOU KNOW THAT. I'M SURPRISED TONY DIDN'T TAKE A JOB IN PHILIPPINES. I HOPE YOU ARE THINKING 'CAUSE I AM COUNTING. WAIT A SECOND. HOLD IT. CAN WE MAKE A DEAL? WHAT KIND OF DEAL? DON'T KNOW. CAN I HAVE A CUP OF COFFEE? NO. OH, DON'T BE BASHFUL. OKAY. ALRIGHT. HERE IS THE SITUATION. I KNOW THE SITUATION. LET ME JUST SAY IT. NUMBER ONE, I HAVE A JOB OFF-BROADWAY, NO PLACE TO SLEEP. NUMBER TWO. YOU DON'T HAVE MONEY. BUT YOU GOT MY APARTMENT. YOU HAVE A DAUGHTER TO THINK ABOUT. I AM THINKING OF HER. DO ME THE COURTESY OF HEARING ME OUT. PLEASE. YOU ARE NOT THE ONLY ONE WHO CAN SCREAM RAPE, YOU KNOW. WE ARE BOTH IN A BIND. THE TWO OF US. THE ONLY PRACTICAL SOLUTION IS WE SHARE THE APARTMENT. I ACCEPT. WHAT? I ACCEPT. I MAY BE STUBBORN BUT I'M NOT STUPID. MEAN IT? MY DAUGHTER GOES TO SCHOOL. I HAVE TO LOOK FOR A JOB. YOU HAVE A KEY. I WOULD HAVE TO STAND GUARD ALL DAY LONG TO KEEP YOU OUT. I ACCEPT. YOU WIN. YOU GET THE SMALL BEDROOM. WHAT THE HELL AM I GETTING MYSELF INTO? I'M IN THE WRONG ROOM. HI. I'M ELLIOT. HELLO. YOU MUST BE LUCY. THAT'S RIGHT. ELLIOT GARFIELD. I'M MOVING INTO THE OTHER ROOM. I'M A FRIEND OF TONY'S. YOU KNOW, TONY DeFOREST. THAT'S NICE. I'M AN ACTOR, TOO. YEAH? WELL, YOUR MOTHER KNOWS. I SEE. WELL...GUESS I'LL BE SEEING YOU AROUND. I GUESS SO. TOODLE-OO. GOODNIGHT. JESUS. I JUST MET LUCY. WHAT DID YOU TELL HER? THAT I WAS MOVING INTO THE OTHER ROOM. SHE SEEMED TO TAKE IT IN STRIDE. YOU GROW UP FAST IN THIS APARTMENT. THE JOHN IS RIGHT OVER THERE. I'LL GET THE REST OF HER THINGS OUT IN THE MORNING. WOULD YOU LIKE TO STOP GRINDING YOUR TEETH? THE NOISE IS DRIVING ME CRAZY. A DRIPPING STRANGER FROM CHICAGO WITH A WET BEARD AND DIRTY SHOES MOVES INTO MY DAUGHTER'S ROOM, AND YOU EXPECT SMILES? I THINK YOU'RE DYNAMITE. I LOVE LISTENING TO YOU TALK. I HATE LIVING WITH YOU, YOUR CONVERSATION IS FIRST-CLASS. THIS IS YOUR ROOM. I DO NOT CLEAN OR MAKE BEDS. USE THE KITCHEN OR THE BATHROOM WHEN I AM NOT IN IT. WASH IT UP WHEN YOU ARE THROUGH. YOU PAY FOR YOUR FOOD, LAUNDRY, LINENS, AND PHONE BILLS. I WOULD APPRECIATE SOME QUIET BETWEEN 6:00 AND 9:00. AS THAT IS WHEN LUCY DOES HER HOMEWORK. DON'T SMOKE GRASS IN FRONT OF MY 10-YEAR-OLD DAUGHTER. DO WE HAVE EVERYTHING STRAIGHT? NO. NO? NO. I'M NOT CRAZY ABOUT THE ARRANGEMENTS. YOU'RE NOT? I'M PAYING THE RENT. I MAKE THE RULES. I DON'T LIKE PANTIES DRYING ON THE ROD. I WILL USE THE KITCHEN WHENEVER I DAMN WELL PLEASE. AND I AM VERY PARTICULAR ABOUT MY CONDIMENTS. I PLAY THE GUITAR DURING THE NIGHT WHENEVER I CANNOT SLEEP. AND I MEDITATE EVERY MORNING. COMPLETE WITH CHANTING. IF YOU'VE GOT TO WALK AROUND, I'D APPRECIATE TIPTOEING. ALSO I SLEEP IN THE NUDE, WINTER AND SUMMER, RAIN OR SNOW, WITH THE WINDOWS OPEN. AND BECAUSE I MAY GO TO THE POTTY OR TO THE FRIDGE DURING THE NIGHT, AND I DON'T WANT TO PUT ON JAMMIES UNLESS YOU'RE LOOKING FOR A QUICK THRILL, I WOULD KEEP MY DOOR CLOSED. THEM'S MY RULES AND REGULATIONS. HOW DOES THAT GRAB YOU. IF I SAY NO? I GOT THIS LAWYER ACQUAINTANCE. I ACCEPT. I DON'T LIKE IT. I DON'T LIKE YOU. BECAUSE I'M AN ACTOR? COUPLED WITH YOUR PERSONALITY. ONE OF GOD'S LITTLE JESTS. IF YOU'LL MOVE YOUR SHAPELY FANNY OUT OF MY ROOM, I WILL UNPACK AND DRY MY BEARD. YOU FORGOT TO SAY GOODNIGHT. I WAS WORKING ON GOODBYE. UNBELIEVABLE. HOW LONG IS HE GONNA STAY? AS LONG AS HE LETS US. GO TO THE BATHROOM. I DON'T HAVE TO. WELL, THEN SAVE IT TILL MORNING. IT'S NOT SAFE OUT THERE. GOODNIGHT. NO KISS? I'M ANGRY. I DON'T WANT TO LOSE IT. OH, CHRIST. LISTEN TO THAT. DID THAT GUITAR WAKE YOU? NO, YOU DID. OH, SORRY. IS HE GOING TO PLAY THAT THING ALL NIGHT? PUT A PILLOW OVER YOUR EAR. OH, MOTHER. IT'S BETTER THAN THAT GUITAR. WHO IS IT? MAY I COME IN? DOOR IS OPEN. ARE YOU DECENT? I AM DECENT. IT IS 3:00 IN THE-- JESUS CHRIST! YOU'RE NAKED. I THOUGHT YOU SAID YOU WERE DECENT. I AM DECENT. I ALSO HAPPEN TO BE NAKED. MR. GARFIELD, I HAVE A GROWING DAUGHTER INSIDE WHO IS NOT GOING TO GROW ON TWO HOURS OF SLEEP. MUST YOU PLAY THAT? IT HELPS ME FALL ASLEEP. HAVE YOU TRIED PILLS? I DON'T KNOW HOW TO PLAY PILLS. YOU POP THEM IN YOUR MOUTH AND SWALLOW. I DO NOT USE UNNATURAL THINGS. MUSIC IS A NATURAL SEDATIVE. IF YOU'D LISTEN TO IT, WE WOULD ALL BE ASLEEP SOON. HOWEVER, IF YOU INSIST, STICK A SLEEPING PILL IN EACH EAR. HE WON'T STOP! I HAVE A LAWYER ACQUAINTANCE, TOO, I CAN GET. JUST TAKE DEEP BREATHS. COUNT TO 100. I'M SORRY, BABY. I AM REALLY SORRY I GOT YOU IN THE MIDDLE OF ALL THIS MESS. LUCE? LUCE? OHMMM... OHMMM... WHAT'S THAT? OHMMM... IT SOUNDS LIKE GOD. OH. OHMMM... OH! FIVE TO 6:00. BOY, GOD GETS UP EARLY. OHMMM... I SMELL STRAWBERRIES BURNING. THAT IS INCENSE. WHAT'S INCENSE? IT IS WHAT I'M FEELING RIGHT NOW. OHMMM... OHMMM... OHMMM... OHMMM... YOU KNOW IT'S FIVE TO 6:00? OHMMM... IN THE MORNING. OHMMM... ISN'T THERE A CHURCH WHERE YOU CAN DO THAT? OHMMM... OHMMM... YOU FINISHED. IS THAT THE LAST CHORUS? I'M IN A BLISSFUL STATE. DON'T BUG ME. IS THIS ROUTINE? GUITARS AT NIGHT, HUMMING IN THE MORNING? MOST MUSICALS HAVE LESS MUSIC. MISS McFADDEN... TODAY I START REHEARSALS FOR MY FIRST NEW YORK PLAY, PROBABLY THE MOST IMPORTANT DAY OF MY LIFE. AM I NERVOUS? NO, I AM NOT NERVOUS. BECAUSE I HAVE MEDITATED, I AM RELAXED, I AM CALM, I AM CONFIDENT. YOU, ON THE OTHER HAND, HAVE NOT MEDITATED. THEREFORE, YOU ARE A PAIN IN THE ASS. TODAY HAPPENS TO BE AN IMPORTANT DAY FOR ME, TOO. I AM AUDITIONING FOR A NEW MUSICAL TODAY. I SLEPT 17 MINUTES LAST NIGHT, THANKS TO YOU. WITH THE BAGS I HAVE UNDER MY EYES, I DON'T HAVE MUCH OF A CHANCE. ARE YOU LISTENING TO ME? UH-HUH. WHAT IS THAT SLOP IN MY DISHES? GRANOLA, WHEAT GERM, SOYA, LECITHIN, NATURAL HONEY. MY BODY IS A TEMPLE WHICH I WORSHIP. IT'S WHAT GIVES ME MY NATURAL DISPOSITION. I'M 63 YEARS OLD. LOOK AT ME. CAN I FIX YOU A BOWL? THIS ISN'T GOING TO WORK. I REALLY DON'T YOU WELL ENOUGH TO DISLIKE YOU, BUT YOU ARE TOO WEIRD TO LIVE WITH. TRY TO FIND ANOTHER PLACE, AND I WILL RETURN THE $600.

HE WAS BORN WITH CURVATURE OF THE SPINE, GIVING THE IMPRESSION HE WAS HUNCHBACKED. HE HAD SOME PARALYSIS, LEFT HAND AND RIGHT FOOT. OLIVIER PLAYED IT RIGHT HAND AND LEFT FOOT. HE ALSO HAD NERVE DAMAGE TO THE RIGHT CHEEK. THE MAN WAS YOUR BASIC GIMP. ALL OF WHICH BRINGS US, BLESS THE WISE AND RICH MRS. ESTELLE MORGENBEIS, TO THIS PRODUCTION. IS THAT THE WAY WE WANT TO PLAY RICHARD? IF SO, THEN I'D RATHER DO A STINT WITH SONNY AND CHER SHOW. RICHARD III WAS A FLAMING HOMOSEXUAL. SO WAS SHAKESPEARE, BUT THAT MOB AT THE GLOBE THEATER WOULDN'T PLUNK DOWN 2 SHILLINGS TO SEE A BUNCH OF PANSIES ONSTAGE. SOCIETY CRIPPLED RICHARD, NOT CHILDBIRTH. READ YOUR TEXT. HE SENT THOSE TWO BOYS TO THE TOWER, AND NOBODY SAW THEM AGAIN. I WANT TO STRIP RICHARD BARE METAPHORICALLY.

NUMBER TWO I LIKE THE DEFORMITIES. NUMBER THREE I'VE BEEN REHEARSING THE PART FOR THREE MONTHS. WELL, I RESPECT THAT, AND WE'RE HERE TO EXCHANGE IDEAS. HOW DO YOU SEE RICHARD? MR. MACHO? IS THAT IT? HE ISN'T A LINEBACKER FOR THE CHICAGO BEARS, BUT DON'T THROW AWAY HIS PRIME MOTIVATION. WHAT'S THAT? HE WANTS TO HUMP LADY ANNE. I'VE HEARD THAT BEFORE. JUST TRY IT MY WAY. LET'S READ THROUGH THE FIRST ACT. PLEASE, TRUST ME. TRUST ME. ACT ONE. EXCUSE ME. EXCUSE ME. SORRY. HOW FAR OFF THE BOARD SHOULD I JUMP? DON'T GIVE ME BETTE MIDLER, BUT LET'S NOT BE AFRAID TO BE BOLD. BOLD? BOLD. ACT ONE, SCENE ONE. ENTER RICHARD, DUKE OF GLOUCESTER. NOW IS THE WINTER OF OUR DISCONTENT-- SORRY, SORRY. EXCUSE ME. NOW IS THE WINTER... NOW IS THE WINTER OF OUR DISCONTENT-- MAY I HAVE A BREAK? FIVE MINUTES. FIVE-MINUTE BREAK, EVERYBODY. 39... OH, MY GOD. 40. OH! OH! THAT'S ALL? I CAN'T DO ANY MORE? 60.

WE'RE NOT RUNNING A HOTEL. WHY DON'T YOU LIKE HIM? WHO INVITED HIM? THAT'S WHY. IF HE WERE A LAWYER, WOULD YOU LIKE HIM? I WOULDN'T LIKE HIM IF I LIKED HIM. HE GRATES ON ME. HE'S CUTE. HE'S LIKE A DOG NOBODY WANTS. YOU ARE NEVER TO THINK HE IS CUTE. NEVER. WHY DID HE WANT TWO APPLES? ONE FOR HIM. ONE FOR HER. WHAT HER? THE GIRL IN THERE. A GIRL IN THE BEDROOM? WHY DIDN'T YOU SAY SOMETHING? SHOULD I WRITE GIRLS DOWN, TOO? YOU KNOCKED? LET'S TALK IN PRIVATE. IT'S A BAD TIME. HOW BOUT AT BREAKFAST. IS THAT A GIRL IN THERE? I CERTAINLY HOPE SO. I WON'T PUT UP WITH THIS. WITH WHAT? THERE'S A GIRL IN YOUR BEDROOM. RHONDA, PAULA McFADDEN, THIS IS RHONDA FONTANA, A GIFTED AND RISING YOUNG ACTRESS. DON'T RISE. HI. HELLO. CAN WE TALK? THIS IS SERIOUS. TAKE A BREAK. OUT. OUT? HER OUT. THEY HAVE MOTELS FOR THAT. I HAVE AN IMPRESSIONABLE 10-YEAR-OLD DAUGHTER. THIS IS NOT AN IMPRESSION I WANT HER PICKING UP. NOW GET THAT RISING YOUNG ACTRESS THE HELL OUT OF THERE. OUT OF MY RENTED APARTMENT THAT YOU ARE STAYING? I WILL BRING HOME ANYONE OR ANYTHING I CHOOSE, INCLUDING A ONE-EYED KANGAROO IF THAT HAPPENS TO BE MY KINKY INCLINATION. AS FOR WHAT IS GOIN ON IN THERE, WE'RE REHEARSING RICHARD III. I HAPPEN TO HAVE A CRETIN FROM MARS DIRECTING THIS PLAY. HOWEVER, IF I ATTEMPT TO HAVE CARNAL KNOWLEDGE OF THAT GORGEOUS BOD, THAT'S HER OPTION, MY PROBLEM, AND NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS. WHAT WAS LUCY'S IMPRESSION OF WHAT WAS GOING ON IN MAMA'S BEDROOM WITH TONY "LOVE 'EM AND LEAVE 'EM" DeFOREST? MAC, TURN OUT SOME LIGHTS. WE'RE RUNNING UP A HECK OF A BILL. YOU OKAY? I'M FINE. LET'S GO TO SLEEP. ARE YOU UPSET BECAUSE THEY'RE MESSING AROUND? THEY ARE NOT MESSING AROUND. THEY ARE REHEARSING RICHARD III. LUCE, DID IT EVER BOTHER YOU ABOUT TONY AND ME? I MEAN, NOT BEING MARRIED AND LIVING TOGETHER? NO. I WANTED TO GET MARRIED. HE COULDN'T GET A DIVORCE. THAT'S OKAY. I JUST WANTED TO KNOW HOW YOU FELT. UH...SOCKS IN THE HAMPER, PLEASE. IS THAT SONG FROM RICHARD III? LET'S BRUSH OUR TEETH. OH, GOD, PLEASE LET ME BE HIT BY A RICH MAN IN A ROLLS ROYCE. I THINK I CAN SWING THAT. THANK YOU. NO, I MEAN IT. IT'S FUNNY YOU SHOULD SAY THAT. WHAT DID I SAY? WELL, THERE'S AN OUTSIDE CHANCE I CAN GET US BOTH A JOB AT THE AUTO SHOW AT THE COLISEUM. IT'S ONLY TWO WEEKS, BUT THE MONEY'S NOT BAD. ANY MONEY'S NOT BAD. WHAT DO WE HAVE TO DO? JUST LOOK PRETTY, POINT TO THE CARS, AND SAY "TERRIFIC." I CAN DO THAT. I CAN POINT AND SAY "TERRIFIC." WELL, THIS FRIEND'S GOING TO LET ME KNOW THIS WEEKEND. JUST KEEP IT A LITTLE QUIET. WHAT A NICE PERSON YOU ARE. YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO TELL ME. WELL, I FEEL KIND OF RELATED. I LIVED WITH BOBBY ALL LAST YEAR. BOBBY WHO? BOBBY KULICK, YOUR EX-HUSBAND. OH, BOBBY.

WE DON'T HAVE TO FIGHT TILL WE GET HOME. WE NEED SOAP, DARLING. NOT IN MY BATHROOM, YOU DON'T. IF YOU GET WHAT YOU NEED, AND I GET WHAT I NEED, WE'RE BLOWING A LOT OF BREAD GETTING THE SAME THINGS. WHY DON'T WE HAVE ONE SHOPPING LIST AND SPLIT THE BILL? ON WHAT ITEMS? FOOD. UH... BATHROOM AND KITCHEN CLEANSERS. EVERYTHING... EXCEPT FEMALE AND MALE DOODADS. IN THAT AREA, YOU GO YOUR WAY, AND I GO MY WAY. WE SPLIT EVERYTHING? EVERYTHING. I'LL PAY MY FULL 1/3 SHARE. 1/3? I'M NOT THE ONE WITH DAUGHTER. DIDN'T LADY ANNE WASH YOUR HANDS THE OTHER NIGHT? QUICK. QUICK. I LIKE A QUICK GIRL. OKAY. RIGHT DOWN THE MIDDLE. OKAY. HOLD IT, HOLD IT. I'LL TAKE CARE OF THAT. GOOD IDEA SHARING EXPENSES. I'LL NEED SHOES SOON. A LITTLE CHIANTI? NOT ON MY BUDGET. I'M SHORT OF STATURE, BUT NOT TIGHT OF POCKET. I'LL BE RIGHT OUT. CAN I HELP YOU? YES. A BOTTLE OF YOUR FINEST CHEAP CHIANTI. I HAVE A CALIFORNIA RED FOR $1.80. $1.80? NOTHING FROM KANSAS? COMEDIAN. THIS IS A NICE RED. THIS GOES WITH SPAGHETTI? PERFECTLY. IT'S UNDER $2.00, RIGHT? $1.80 IS UNDER $2.00, AS FAR AS I KNOW. MY BAG! THEY TOOK MY BAG! WHAT? WHO? IN THE CAR. THEY ROBBED ME! EVERYTHING WAS IN MY BAG! THOSE DIRTY BASTARDS! GO AFTER THEM! AFTER A SPEEDING CAR? THANKS. THANKS A LOT! SHOULD I FIGHT THEM WITH A CAN OF TOMATO PASTE? LEAVE ME ALONE! I STILL THINK YOU OUGHT TO CALL THE POLICE. I'LL CALL THEM FOR YOU. YOU WEREN'T THAT HELPFUL WHILE THEY ROBBED ME. I'M NOT A GERMAN SHEPHERD, YOU KNOW. IT'S THEM! WHO? THE ONES WHO TOOK MY BAG! STOP! STOP! WHAT IS THIS, POLICE WOMAN? I'M GONNA GET A BULLET BETWEEN MY GODDAMN EYES. SOMEBODY, STOP THOSE MEN! WAIT! HEY! GIVE ME THE BAG! GET OUT OF THE CAR! HOLD IT. HOLD IT! I WAS JUST ASKING! HOLD IT! RELAX. A SIMPLE QUESTION. HOLD IT. KIDDING. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. I HAD ALL MY MONEY IN THERE, EVERYTHING, MY LAST DOLLAR IN THE WORLD. YOU AND YOUR GODDAMN CHIANTI. WHY CAN'T YOU AT LEAST THANK ME FOR RISKING MY LIFE FOR YOU? DID YOU GET MY BAG BACK? NO. SO WHY SHOULD I THANK YOU? WHY DO I HAVE SUCH LOUSY LUCK WITH ACTORS? I HATE ALL OF YOU. GET AWAY FROM ME. JUST GET AWAY. THEY DIDN'T ROB YOU BECAUSE I'M AN ACTOR. AFTER I GRADUATED FROM NORTHWESTERN, I TOOK MY FIRST SUMMER JOB. I DID 10 PLAYS IN 10 WEEKS. I HAD HEPATITIS AND MUMPS AND NEVER KNEW IT. I THOUGHT I WAS JUST GETTING YELLOW AND FAT. WHICH PLAYS? I PLAYED THE REPORTER IN INHERIT THE WIND. GENE KELLY DID IN THE MOVIE. THAT'S RIGHT. HE DIDN'T DIG AS DEEPLY AS I DID. NEXT I DID CYRANO DE BERGERAC. JOSE FERRER. I GOT LAUGHS WITH HALF THE NOSE. STYLE COUNTS. YOU DON'T THINK MUCH OF YOURSELF. I GOT A BIG EGO. YOU GOT TO SEE THE FACE TO APPRECIATE THE WORK. I TAUGHT DRAMA AT DULUTH JUNIOR COLLEGE. YOU TAUGHT DRAMA? FAR OUT! VERY FAR OUT. IT'S UP NEAR CANADA. WANT SOME MORE WINE? NIENTE CHIANTI. THAT'S GOOD. YOU'RE TERRIFIC WITH WORDS. WORDS ARE AN ACTOR'S CANVAS. HIS LIPS ARE HIS BRUSHES. HIS TONGUE, THE COLORS. WHEN HE SPEAKS, HE PAINTS PORTRAITS. HE'S VERY CLASSY. THE KID'S GOT A GOOD EYE. TONY WASN'T A CLASSY ACTOR. HE WAS JUST... SEXY. YOU DON'T THINK I'M SEXY? ARE YOU KIDDING? WHAT DO YOU KNOW? YOU'RE 10 YEARS OLD. IN THREE YEARS, I'LL DRIVE YOU WILD. IT'S AFTER 9:00. DO YOUR HOMEWORK. FIVE MORE MINUTES. WE NEVER HAD A GOOD TALKER AT DINNER. IN A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM, I PLAYED THE SAME PART MICKEY ROONEY PLAYED IN THE MOVIE. PUCK! THE LADY PRODUCER FROM NEW YORK ASKED ME TO PLAY RICHARD III. IT'S OFF, OFF, OFF-BROADWAY. ARE WE INVITED TO THE OPENING? YOU TWO CAN COME TUESDAY NIGHT. TUESDAY'S A SCHOOL NIGHT. TONY'S OPENING WAS ON A SCHOOL NIGHT. I SAID NO. SHIT! SHOOT. I THINK I'M IN TROUBLE. GOODNIGHT. WOULD YOU BE INTERESTED IN MY BEDROOM? TALKING TO ME? YOU CAN HAVE THE BIG BEDROOM FOR AN EXTRA $50 A MONTH, PAYABLE IN CASH NOW. A RENT INCREASE FOR GETTING WHAT I SHOULD HAVE GOTTEN? NO, THANKS. WOULD YOU LEND ME $50? I'LL EITHER PAY YOU 7 1/2% INTEREST OR DO YOUR LAUNDRY. THEY REALLY CLEANED YOU OUT, HUH? EVERYONE FROM HERE TO ITALY. I HAVE, UH... $28 AND CHANGE. I'LL SPLIT IT WITH YOU. STARTING OPENING NIGHT, I GET $240 A WEEK. I'LL MAKE A DEAL. I'LL PAY ALL THE LIVING EXPENSES TILL YOU GET YOURSELF A JOB, AND I'LL EVEN DO MY OWN LAUNDRY. I SEE. AND WHAT DO YOU GET? OH... ALL YOU GOT TO DO IS BE NICE TO ME. YOU GO TO HELL! WILL YOU LISTEN TO ME? EVERYONE'S NOT AFTER YOUR MAGNIFICENT BODY, LADY. IT'S NOT SO MAGNIFICENT. IT'S FAIR, BUT IT AIN'T KEEPING ME UP NIGHTS. YOU'RE NOT EVEN VERY PRETTY. MAYBE IF YOU SMILED ONCE IN A WHILE, OKAY, BUT THAT'S AGAINST YOUR RELIGION. YOU'RE NOT THE ONLY PERSON EVER DUMPED ON. I'M A RECENT DUMPEE. I AM A DEDICATED ACTOR, PAULA. BECAUSE OF A MENTALLY ARTHRITIC DIRECTOR, I'M PLAYING THE SECOND-GREATEST ROLE IN THE HISTORY OF THEATER LIKE A FRESH CALIFORNIA FRUIT SALAD. WHEN I SAY NICE, I MEAN FAIR. I'M A FAIR PERSON. I DON'T WANT TO JUMP ON YOU. I'LL TELL YOU WHAT I LIKE ABOUT YOU. LUCY. SHE'S WORTH PUTTING UP WITH YOU. HERE'S $14 FOR HER CARE AND FEEDING. YOU GET ZIPPIDY DOO-DAH. WANT ANY MONEY, BORROW IT FROM YOUR DAUGHTER. I AM NOW GOING INSIDE MY ROOM TO MEDITATE AWAY MY HOSTILITY TOWARDS YOU. PERSONALLY, I DON'T THINK IT CAN BE DONE. AS YOU ARE WEARY, REST YOU, WHILST I LAMENT KING HENRY'S CORSE. STAY, YOU THAT BEAR THE CORSE, AND SET IT DOWN. WHAT BLACK MAGICIAN CONJURES UP THIS FIEND? MY LORD, LET THE COFFIN PASS. UNMANNERED DOG, STAND THOU WHEN I COMMAND. ADVANCE THY HALBERD HIGHER-- GOOD! GOOD! THAT I MIGHT DIE AT ONCE, FOR NOW THEY KILL ME WITH A LIVING DEATH. THOSE EYES OF THINE FROM MINE HAVE DRAWN SALT TEARS, SHAMED THEIR ASPECT WITH STORE OF CHILDISH DROPS. THESE EYES, WHICH NEVER SHED A REMORSEFUL TEAR... WHAT IS IT? AM I DISTURBING YOU? YES! SORRY. THEN DON'T DISTURB ME. YOU'RE SNAPPING. I WAS SARCASTIC. SNAPPING IS, "BUG OFF, I'M BUSY!" WHAT'S WRONG? WHAT'S WRONG? NOTHING'S WRONG. WHAT MAKES YOU THINK SOMETHING'S WRONG? YOU OPEN WITH RICHARD III IN FRONT OF ALL THE NEW YORK CRITICS TOMORROW NIGHT WITH A CHARTREUSE HUMP ON YOUR BACK. WHAT'S WRONG? I'M TRYING TO SAVE MY CAREER! THAT'S WHAT'S WRONG. WHAT DO YOU WANT? NO, DON'T TELL ME! I DIPPED INTO YOUR PEANUT BUTTER, RIGHT? HOW MUCH DO I OWE YOU? I JUST CAME TO REPAY YOU YOUR $14. I GOT A JOB. DO YOU HAVE SOME BICARBONATE? LUCY IS SICK. WHAT'S WRONG WITH HER? SHE HAD TWO SUNDAES FOR DINNER. I ORDERED THEM. INCREDIBLE! I'M SURPRISED THEY DON'T SELL INSURANCE POLICIES TO CHILDREN. THAT'S BICARBONATE? DON'T START! HOW'S IT FEELING, LUCE? DID YOU SEE THE EXORCIST? YEAH. THEN YOU BETTER GET OUT OF THE ROOM. YOU'LL BE OKAY. LUCY, TURN OVER ON YOUR BACK. RELAX, COME ON. DON'T YOU TRUST ME? I TRUSTED MY MOTHER TODAY, AND LOOK HOW I FEEL. I WANT YOU TO TAKE SLOW, DEEP BREATHS. GO ON. NOW. THAT'S IT. WATCH. THINK YOU CAN DO THIS? I MIGHT BE ABLE TO MANAGE IT. EYES CLOSED, LUCE. KEEP BREATHING DEEPLY. DEEP BREATH. THAT'S IT. HOW'S THE PLAY GOING? SHH! ONE SICK PERSON AT A TIME. CLOSE YOUR EYES. FEELING ANY BETTER? A LITTLE. ISN'T THIS MORE SOOTHING THAN MEDICINE? IT TASTES BETTER, TOO. MOM, CAN WE GO TO THE OPENING? YOU STILL OWE ME A PRESENT. TODAY WAS THE PITS. SURE. ANYTHING YOU SAY. TERRIFIC. NOW YOU HAVE TO GET ME A DRESS. THANK YOU. I'M REALLY SORRY ABOUT YESTERDAY. IT WAS VERY GENEROUS OF YOU. I'M NOT USED TO THE KINDNESS OF STRANGERS. I KNOW. BLANCHE DUBOIS IN STREETCAR. SOMETIMES I FEEL LIKE HER. YOU START TO TRUST A MAN, AND THEY TAKE YOU AWAY AT THE END OF THE MOVIE. I'M SORRY FOR... WELL, I'M JUST SORRY. I'M ATTEMPTING TO BE NICE, DECENT, AND FAIR. HOW AM I DOING? MR. GARFIELD? MR. GARFIELD. WAKE UP. YOU CAN'T SLEEP WITH MY DAUGHTER. UPSTAIRS TO THE RIGHT. THANK YOU.

WE CAME BACK TO TELL YOU HOW MUCH WE ENJOYED IT. I HAD THE BEST TIME. FIRST I THOUGHT IT WAS BORING. OH, BUT THEN IT PICKED UP NEAR THE END. WE WON'T KEEP YOU. WE JUST WANTED TO THANK YOU FOR THE LOVELY EVENING. PEOPLE WERE TALKING ABOUT YOU ON THE WAY OUT. THEY DON'T EVER WANT TO FORGET YOUR NAME. WELL, GOODNIGHT. I THOUGHT YOU WERE WONDERFUL. COME ON, LUCY. PETER, YOU WON'T BELIEVE IT. ARE YOU ALRIGHT? OH, GOD! ARE YOU ALRIGHT? THOU HAST BROKEN THY VASE. THOU OWEST THEE $12.98 PLUS TAXES. ARE YOU OKAY? NOT ACCORDING TO THE TIMES.

I KEEP DOING THE SAME DAMN THING TO MYSELF OVER AND OVER AGAIN. WHEN AM I EVER GONNA LEARN? LISTEN, I AM NOT UP TO FALLING IN LOVE AGAIN. IT'S TOO MUCH WORK. I THINK WE WOULD ALL BE A WHOLE LOT BETTER OFF IF YOU JUST LEFT. NOTHING PERSONAL. HEY! I THINK I HAVE A CLUE NOW AS TO WHY ALL THOSE GUYS LEFT. CRACKERS! ANIMAL CRACKERS, LADY. YOU GOT A SEVERE CASE OF EMOTIONAL RETARDATION. I'M NOT LEAVING, PAULA. I'M ESCAPING. I WILL PERSONALLY FORWARD YOUR MAIL. KEEP IT. I'M NOT GIVING YOU A FORWARDING ADDRESS. LOTS OF WEIRDOES AROUND. JUST IN PASSING, I'D JUST LIKE TO SAY THAT LAST NIGHT WAS TERRIFIC. IT WAS THE SUPER BOWL OF ROMANCE. I GIVE IT A FAT 9, ON A SCALE OF 10. YOU LOSE ONE POINT FOR BURPING YOUR WINE. IT WAS A VERY RESPECTABLE SCORE. DON'T YOU GET GLIB, ABOUT LAST NIGHT. IT WAS VERY IMPORTANT TO ME. YOU WANNA LOWER YOUR NEUROSIS, FOR ONE MINUTE I'M NOT FINISHED. YOU WANNA KNOW WHAT YOUR PROBLEM IS? WHAT? YOU LOVE TO LOVE SOMEBODY, BUT WHEN THEY TAKE THE INITIATIVE, LIKE I DID LAST NIGHT, THAT SCARES THE PANTS OFF YOU. NOTHING OFF-COLOR INTENDED. YOU DIDN'T WAIT AT ANY STAGE DOOR FOR ME, YOU KNOW. I APPROACHED FIRST. I TOUCHED FIRST. YOU CAN'T HANDLE THAT CAN YOU? HE'S LAUGHABLE. HA HA. AND SILLY, YOU ARE A SILLY MAN. YOU ARE THE SILLIEST MAN I EVER MET. YOU KNOW THAT I'M RIGHT. IF YOU DON'T LET GOOF ME, I AM GONNA PUNCH YOUR OTHER EYE OUT. YOU KNOW YOURSELF TOO WELL TO IGNORE WHAT I AM SAYING. THAT'S WHY I'M TRYING TO IGNORE IT. DESPITE THE FACT THAT YOU'RE ONE LARGE PAIN IN THE ARSE, LAST NIGHT WAS THE BEST THING THAT'S HAPPENED TO ME. IF YOU WEREN'T BEHAVING LIKE SUCH A HORSE'S RECTUM, YOU'D KNOW THAT WE COULD BE TOUCHING AND FONDLING ALL DAY TILL I GOT TO GO TO REHEARSAL. PERSONALLY, MADAM, I THINK YOU BLEW IT. LADY ANNE! LADY ANNE! THE BLACK PRINCE IS DEAD. ENGLAND IS YOURS. YOU DON'T WANT ENGLAND? WOULD YOU TAKE SPAIN? SPAIN I CAN GET YOU CHEAP. WHAT ARE YOU DOING IN THAT THING? COME ON. GET IN, QUICK. HORSE IS GOT A METER ON HIM. WHERE TO? WE'RE GOING HOME TO TARA. GET IN! CYNTHIA FEIN, RIGHT? I THINK YOU GOT CHARISMA, TOO. LUCY, DID YOU TELL HIM? I NEVER SAID THAT. I'M GONNA GET YOU LUCY, YOU BIG FINK! WANT TO GO TO MY OPENING, TONIGHT? I OWE YOU A GOOD TIME AFTER THE LAST ONE. I HAVE HOMEWORK. WHAT ARE YOU SORE ABOUT ME AND YOUR MOM? IT'S NONE OF MY BUSINESS. SINCE YOU AND I ARE EXCHANGING ROOMS TONIGHT, I THINK IT IS. ONLY I'M A LITTLE OLD FASHION I WANT YOUR APPROVAL. ME? I'M ONLY 10. I'M NOT ALLOWED TO VOTE YET. I LIKE YOUR STYLE, KID I REALLY DO. SORRY, YOU DON'T LIKE TO BE CALLED "KID." I'M A KID. IT FITS. DO YOU LIKE ME? YOU'RE WASTING A LOT OF MONEY, I'M NOT ENJOYING THIS RIDE. ANSWER MY QUESTION. DO YOU LIKE ME? ASK CYNTHIA FEIN. SHE'S CRAZY ABOUT YOU. I'LL KEEP ASKING YOU, UNTIL YOU ANSWER ME. DO YOU LIKE ME? CAN I GET OUT? IM GETTING-- ANSWER MY QUESTION, YES OR NO? IT MAKES NO DIFFERENCE TO ME, ONE WAY OR ANOTHER. CAUSE I'M MOVING IN WITH YOUR OLD LADY ANYWAY. I WANNA HEAR IT FROM YOUR OWN LIPS. NOW YES OR NO? NO. YES. WAS THAT A YES? YES. A REALLY, REALLY, REALLY LOT? YES, ALRIGHT? OKAY. AS MUCH AS YOU LIKE ME, IT'S NOT A THOUSANDTH AS MUCH AS I'M CRAZY ABOUT YOU. I SWEAR TO GOD LUCY. YOU CAN CRY. I DON'T CARE. I'LL TELL YOU ANYWAY. I AM CERTIFIABLY NUTS ABOUT YOU AND YOUR MOM. BLOW THAT INTO YOUR HANDKERCHIEF. I DON'T HAVE ONE. SO CRY ON THE HORSEY. OKAY? YOU KNOW WHAT I WANT MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE IN THE WHOLE WORLD? MY VERY OWN LIVING ROOM SET. YOU KNOW, IT'S A NICE FEELING TO HEAR REAL PEOPLE APPLAUDING. I TOOK THE NAMES, AND ADDRESSES OF EVERYONE IN THE AUDIENCE. THINK WE SHOULD HAVE THEM OVER FOR DINNER, REAL SOON. WE DEFINITELY HAVE TO REPAINT THE BEDROOM, DON'T YOU THINK? WHAT? I'M REDECORATING. WHAT COLOR SHOULD WE PAINT THE BEDROOM? SUCCESSFUL. THAT'S GOOD. SOMETHING IS WRONG. IT DIDN'T COME OUT RIGHT. ELLIOT, WHAT'S WRONG WITH IT? FIRST PLACE, IT'S NOT ON PARK AVENUE. HOW MANY MORE WEEKS DO YOU HAVE TO PLAY BEFORE I COULD GET AN ARMCHAIR? FOR ONE WITHOUT ARMS, ABOUT A YEAR. MAMA BEAR DID THE CAVE REAL NICE. WHERE ARE YOU GOING? HEY. I'M CRAZY ABOUT YOU. I'M VERY FOND OF YOU MYSELF. YOU HAVE SOME NICE QUALITIES. LEAVE TUESDAY MORNING OPEN. WHY, WHAT'S TUESDAY? HOW DO BLOOD TESTS STRIKE YOU? AAH! FOUR STARS! IT WAS A GREAT AUDIENCE. A FOUR-STAR SHOW. I WANNA TAKE THE SHOW HOME AND BOTTLE IT. I WANT TO GO HOME AND SLEEP TILL WEDNESDAY. HEY, ED, THERE IS NO AIR IN HERE. I CAN'T DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT. GIVE THE ACTORS SOME AIR! WE ARE HUMAN BEINGS, NOT CATTLE! LET'S HEAR IT FOR THE ACTORS! YAY! LET'S HEAR IT FOR THE ACTORS. HELLO. WHO IS THAT? HELLO. OLIVER FRY. OLIVER FRY THE DIRECTOR? I BELIEVE SO. IT'S NICE TO MEET YOU. OLIVER FRY-- WHAT DO YOU KNOW? WOULD YOU LIKE TO COME IN? HERE, UH... YEAH, COME ON IN. HI. PLEASED TO MEET YOU. HI, IT'S VERY NICE TO-- WE WON'T KEEP YOU. THERE WAS JUST ONE QUESTION I WANTED TO ASK. WOULD YOU BE INTERESTED IN A MOVIE? YOU MEAN MAKING ONE? OR WE COULD GO TO ONE, BUT I THINK WORKING IS MUCH MORE FUN. WITH YOU? YES. YES, I'M-- I'M INTERESTED. I AM, TOO. ARE YOU KIDDING? HA HA HA HA. CERTAINLY. YEAH, SURE. MM-HMM. HEY, WHAT ARE YOU DOING OUT HERE? YOU DIDN'T LOCK YOURSELF OUT AGAIN, DID YOU? LUCY, WHAT IS IT? AT LEAST WE DIDN'T GET A LETTER THIS TIME. SENDING THAT STUFF TO THE LAUNDRY, I HOPE. I GOT A PICTURE, PAULA. I GOT A PICTURE, I GOT A MOVIE. OH, SHIT. TERRIFIC PICTURE. OLIVER FRY IS DIRECTING. I GOT TO BE ON LOCATION IN SEATTLE TOMORROW. SEATTLE, WASHINGTON. I KNOW. IT'S FAR AWAY. WHO CARES? I'M NOT WALKING. THERE'S A FIRST-CLASS TICKET AT THE AIRPORT FOR ME. FOUR WEEKS' WORK, $2,000 A WEEK. I MEAN, IT'S FREAKING OLIVER FRY! I DIDN'T ASK WHAT THE PART WAS. THAT'S WONDERFUL. I'M NOT MAKING ANY COMPARISONS, YOU KNOW. WHO EVER HEARD OF AL PACINO BEFORE THE GODFATHER? I'M COULDN'T BE HAPPIER FOR YOU. JESUS, I AM SO SCARED. I SPENT 20 YEARS BUILDING UP MY EGO, AND WHEN I REALLY NEED IT IT LOCKED IN THE JOHN. IT WILL COME BACK TO YOU, TRUST ME. WHAT'S WRONG? IT'S ONLY FOUR WEEKS. THAT'S ONE WEEK LESS THAN FIVE. I KNOW. OH, YOU DON'T KNOW. YOU THINK YOU'LL GET DUMPED ON AGAIN. IF YOU SAY YOU'LL BE BACK, WHY SHOULDN'T I BELIEVE YOU? IF I WERE YOU, AND I SAW AN ACTOR PACKING, I WOULDN'T BELIEVE HIM EITHER. YOU NEED ANY HELP? NO, I SEE YOU TOOK EVERYTHING. WELL, THEY SAID IT WOULD BE FREEZING, TAKE ALL MY WARM CLOTHING. YOU KNOW I WOULD TAKE YOU IF I COULD, BUT IT'S ROUGH COUNTRY UP THERE. IT'S UP IN THE MOUNTAINS. THERE ARE WOLVES. I DON'T MEAN IN THE MOVIE, EITHER. I MEAN REAL HUNGRY WOLVES. I ALWAYS GOT ALONG WITH WOLVES. I THOUGHT YOU'D BE EXCITED. JUMPING UP AND DOWN. IT'S WHAT I'VE WORKED FOR MY WHOLE LIFE. ISN'T THAT WHAT A MATURE RELATIONSHIP IS ALL ABOUT. I ROOT FOR YOU, YOU ROOT FOR ME. IT'S MY THIRD TIME UP AS CHEERLEADER. OKAY, OKAY! I GET THE POINT. FORGET IT. I'M NOT GOING. IT'S NOT WORTH IT NOT IF IT MEANS I GOTTA PUT YOU THROUGH FOUR WEEKS OF HELL WONDERING WHETHER I'M COMING BACK OR NOT, FORGET IT. IT'S JUST A JOB, RIGHT? HELL WITH IT. IF I GOT THIS JOB, I CAN GET ANOTHER JOB. I'M NOT GONNA GO, OKAY? THE HELL I WON'T GO! THAT'S CRAZY. THAT'S A DUMB STUPID THING TO DO, BECAUSE YOU DON'T TRUST ME. YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO TRUST ME PAULA, DO YOU TRUST ME? I'LL PLAN MY DAYS AROUND IT. I HATE THOSE GUYS THAT WALKED OUT OF HERE, I HATE THEM. I'M THE ONE THAT'S COMING BACK, AND I'M GETTING ALL THE BLAME. NO. YOU GO, ELLIOT. I WANT YOU TO GO. IF YOU COME BACK, FINE. I'LL BE HERE PUTTING UP MY WALLPAPER. IF NOT, THAT'S OKAY, TOO. I'LL MISS YOU. BUT I'LL SURVIVE BECAUSE I'VE GROWN UP THESE LAST COUPLE MONTHS. LOOK AT ME. I'M ALL GROWN UP. IT WAS BETTER THAN SUMMER CAMP. I NEVER FELT, BETTER OR STRONGER. SOMEONE IS WALKING OUT THAT DOOR, AND I'M NOT CRUMBLING INTO A MILLION PIECES. WELL, JESUS, IT REALLY DOES FEEL GOOD. GOOD-BYE, ELLIOT. MAKE A NICE MOVIE, A WONDERFUL CAREER. IF YOU'RE EVER UP FOR AN ACADEMY AWARD, I PROMISE YOU, I'LL KEEP MY FINGERS CROSSED FOR YOU. WHAT IS IT ABOUT YOU THAT MAKE'S A MAN WITH A 147 I.Q. FEEL LIKE A DRIBBLING IDIOT? I DON'T KNOW, BUT WHATEVER IT IS I THANK GOD FOR IT. YOU'RE WELCOME, GOD. INTERESTING LESSON I'M LEARNING. REALLY INTERESTING. THIS COULD BE THE FALLING IN LOVE AND BECOMING SUCCESSFUL IS PROBABLY THE WORST THING THAT COULD EVER HAPPEN TO A GUY. IF MY PLANE CRASHES IN THE STORM, I'M COMING BACK HERE. I MEAN IT. I MEAN IT. YOU'LL BE DRAGGING CHAINS AROUND THIS APARTMENT WHEN YOU'RE 90. SO LONG, KID. I'LL SEE YOU, KID. I CAN'T SLEEP. GIVE IT FIVE MINUTES. YOU JUST GOT INTO BED. I CAN PREDICT THE FUTURE. YEAH? HOW ABOUT PREDICTING MINE? I CAN PREDICT THE PHONE RINGING. HELLO. GET DRESSED. WHAT? GET DRESSED, YOU'RE COME WITH ME. WHERE ARE YOU? ON THE CORNER, IN MY OLD, LEAKY PHONE BOOTH. OH, ELLIOT! ELLIOT!

COME ON, PAULA THE CAB IS TICKING AWAY YOUR BEDROOM SET. I THOUGHT I COULDN'T COME WITH YOU. I'LL TELL THEM YOU'RE MY ANALYST. AND YOU REALLY WANT ME TO COME? OH, JESUS YOU SURE LOVE A LOVE SCENE. YEAH, I WANT YOU TO COME. OH, THEN IT'S OKAY, I DON'T HAVE TO! JUST AS LONG AS YOU ASKED! PAULA, DON'T PLAY GAMES. MY SOCKS ARE UNDER WATER. NO, YOU HAVE ENOUGH WORK WITHOUT WORRYING ABOUT ME.
