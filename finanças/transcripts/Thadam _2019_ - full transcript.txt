'THADAM (THE TRAIL)' Legal loopholes exist mainly to safeguard the innocent from being punished. 'EZHIL' Dude... The girl wearing green top? Her name is Deepika. She works for a movie website. She writes reviews. We both have different working hours. Excuse me. Sorry. The only time I get to see her is in the elevator every morning. Exactly at 09:10. If I miss out, I won’t be able to see her all day. She knows I see her. At first, she deliberately avoided me. The crowd would slowly thin out, and by the 7th floor, we'd be the only two people left. So, she will be left with no option. She has to acknowledge me. Then one day, I asked her. Can I take you out for a cup of coffee? Cheers, dude! What did she say? You didn't tell me your name... or introduce yourself. But you’ve come straight to the point? I only have 2 seconds. You're on the 7th floor, I'm on the 8th. Where’s there time to waste? She agreed to go out for coffee? So...? Your question is wrong. Ask me the question the right way, and we’ll go. “Ask me the question the right way.” What sort of an answer is that? She should either agree to go with you or refuse. Bye, dude! I need to leave now to catch the elevator. Okay, bye. It's a feminist thing, right? It's wrong to ask, "Can 'I' take you out?" I don't have a problem. Will you take me out for a cup of coffee? Your question is still wrong. Hold on... You’re an equal rights champion. "Can I take you out?" "Will you take me out?" Both questions are wrong. Can we go out for a cup of coffee? Sorry. Give me a clue. She is duping you, dude. You're taking me for a ride, aren't you? No matter which way I ask, you're only going to refuse. I swear I'm not lying. Ask me the question in the right way, and we’ll definitely go out. "Can I take you out for a cup of coffee?" "Will you take me out for a cup of coffee?" "Can we go out for a cup of coffee?" Your question is wrong. Ask me the question in the right way, and we’ll go. Darn, woman! Tell me? - I got it! Tomorrow... she will go out with me. It was a simple one. But I was breaking my head over it unnecessarily. Can we have some hot tea? Let's go. I hate coffee. My name is Ezhil. I know. You're a civil engineer. You work in the construction company at the 8th floor. You stay in Adayar. You don't smoke or drink. You love Ilaiyaraja's music. What? Don't know what to say. You seem to know my bio-data! 'KAVIN' See... What is this? It's an ATM machine, Seth! What? An ATM machine? Why have you plucked it out by the roots? Haven’t you heard the news? - I don't follow the news. It’s our news that’s trending in all Andhra TV Channels. We picked it up at Tada. We had planned to break it open right there. But we couldn't. So we snatched the entire unit. There are dents here. We tried to break it open. But only ended up breaking two crowbars. Why did you bring it here? Do you know any ATM mechanics? Someone who knows the mechanism can open this easily. They loaded cash into this machine right in front of our eyes. There should be at least 30 to 35 lakhs. Easily. They've brought a stolen ATM machine loaded with cash. But we couldn't open it. Okay. - I think he's found a guy. I found a guy. Didn’t I tell you? But, he'll be here only tomorrow. Tomorrow...? Seth, carrying the machine around in the vehicle is a big risk. The cops are patrolling the streets. You can keep it in my go-down till the mechanic arrives. It's okay, buddy. I've known Seth for three years now. He is trustworthy. Seth, give us a couple of lakhs now. When we open the machine and find out how much money is in there... we can discuss how to share it. What say? - No way! Let the mechanic come. Sorry, Seth. There are six of us, including the ATM security guard. We need to give them something tonight. I'll find another place. Let's go. I convinced him it’s better to do business with a known scoundrel... than with an unknown honest man. Kavin... I'll call you when the mechanic arrives. Dad, the ATM mechanic is here. Fools! They didn’t know the money is here, and instead tried to break it here. They snatched this at the Andhra border. Seth, is the mechanic there yet? You said he'd be there today! Not yet! I will call you when he is here. Don't cheat us. You must open the machine only in our presence. I know. Hang up now. You heard that? There should be 30 to 35 lakhs. Seth, you've been tricked! This isn't original. It's a fake. A fake? The 30 lakhs is not visible to my eyes. Do you see it? 'Hocus-pocus! Hocus-pocus! We all do it, hocus-pocus.' 'Teensy-weensy! Teensy weensy! We all have teensy weensy addictions.' 'Desire is good, it makes you live longer. Lie when you need to, it's okay to err.' 'Make some cash, count your dough. No point in locking up your gold.' The man in blue shirt. He is 65 years old. A retired postmaster. He posted an ad in the matrimony columns. We met only yesterday. He said he liked me right away! Cover me. You meant me? Can it be seen? Can what be seen? I've been going with him from one temple to another for the last 2 hours. I'm going crazy without a smoke. What are you staring at? This way the damage is only 50 percent. So it's healthy! Did you see that? We're going on a date tomorrow. Ask me how! - How? At first, a health check up at Apollo. If we do it tomorrow, we get a 10% discount! Then a concert at Naradha Ghana Sabha. He says it was for someone like me that he waited all these years! Before these cigarettes kill me, I think this bonehead's cheesy lines will! He is smiling at me. I told him you're my friend's son. He'll be here in 5 minutes. He wants us to get married in January. Before that, I'll somehow get his account number. He should have at least 5 to 10 lakhs. We can clean him out. I've worked out a proper plan. What say? You get a 20% cut. Wish I could find a rich cop or a government servant! Are you on Instagram? Bye! - Oh, in Saligram. Hold on. My purse? 'No rules, no morals - There ain't no boss; More money, more money - Make no noise!' 'No savings, no hoarding - That's how we roll; We feel no fear - We stand tall.' 'No rules, no morals - There ain't no boss; More money, more money - Make no noise!' 'No savings, no hoarding - That's how we roll; We feel no fear - We stand tall.' You think she saw us? Even if she did, she won't come in. This is the gents' toilet. We are safe here. Why don't you answer my calls? - She is here! I've been calling you for a week now! I thought you'd get it. - Get what? This won't work out. What, our relationship? Of all the places to discuss a relationship... Then why did you give me hope? Hope? Did I ever say I loved you? Did I say I'll marry you? - No... But we went to beach resorts a couple of times. He says he is not interested. We can't go unless you go now. You came to the toilet to escape from me didn’t you? Is this where you break up, guys? She saw him come in, and followed him here. Get it over with, man. You pick up girls with ease and dump them in 2 days! They get boring after that. - Boring? Women are just like men. They're all selfish. I've invested my dad's entire savings in this project. My savings, too. I'm building a 2 storeyed apartment. Six units in total. Premium 2 BHK Flats. If this project is successful, I'll make it. Or else... It will be successful. I love you. My dad is no more. My mom is living with her husband in Dubai. Second marriage. I haven't seen her in 8 years. She is happy with her kids. Your roommate isn't here? No, she's working the day shift. I never thought I'd fall in love with an engineer. A writer... or a filmmaker... I was hoping someone like that would come into my life. What's wrong with an engineer? They're boring! Accounts, planning, concrete, construction... Life needs some magic, right? You want magic, huh? You took this picture in Kolkata, right? Yes. You've seen Howrah Bridge? Are you going to say it's an engineering marvel? You wear these without a second thought... Do you know the engineering behind this? - Give that to me! Seriously! The concept behind Howrah Bridge and this strapless bra is the same! Think about it... such a magnificent bridge. And this... both have the same design. Give it back! - It's the cantilever bridge principle. Wait! It's got no pillars. But it can support any weight. C’mon, isn't that magic? Give it to me! - You're saying that isn't magic? This is something only engineering can achieve, my sweetheart! Fool! - What? That's my roommate's bra! Have you no sense? Give it! Give it to me. It's my shop. Eighteen shops including mine. We got caught in a cheating case. They sealed my shop shut. My wife left after that, and my life was done, too. When did they seal your shop? It was before we met. It's been four years now. I need to go to the court tomorrow. There's a hearing. The lawyer said I'm getting a three year sentence. You asked me why I was in a bad mood since morning... this is why! The other shop owners are rich. They'd be okay even if they go to prison. Have you got your case-file? Why do you want to read that? The lawyer's already read it a hundred times. I'll be going to prison anyway! Three years in prison... I'll get ripped apart. I heard there are perverts in there. If a handsome guy like me ends up in prison... that's it! I'll get punctured! How about you beat my face into a pulp? The prison is dangerous for good looking men like me. It’s going to be oil massages for me from tomorrow! Ask for a discharge. You'll get it. What? A discharge? Are you kidding? Your friend sold 33 computers claiming it to be Dell. Only the packing boxes were original! All 33 computers were fake. He got caught red handed. How can we get a discharge? He’s getting three years, confirmed. Did you read the seizure memo? Why should I read that? The charge sheet is very clear. The memo mentions only the seizing of the packing boxes. There is no mention of the computers. Careless mistake! The guy who wrote the memo screwed up. This should be enough. Ask for a discharge. You'll get it. There were 18 shop owners, including me. I was the only one they let go. 'Play till the game is over, run till the end line; The tide must rise to fall again.' 'You're a bright lad, with tricks up your sleeve' Ain't no locks that you can't pick.' 'My heart is filled with a growing greed; It makes a sound louder than the heartbeat.' 'The rooster crows only at dawn; We all carry sorrow deep down.' You know Suruli was embroiled in a case? It was Kavin who saved him by finding a loophole. What were you doing before you met me? What did you study? 12th grade! - 12th grade? Dude, even I am a Bachelor of Commerce in Literature! Why do you ask? - It's just that... you said something to the lawyer. I could tell it was something technical, but didn't know what! Then the Judge released only me... the other shop owners were given 5 year sentences. You speak some 6 or 7 languages. You seem to know law points that even lawyers don't know of. So intelligent. Who are you? Who? 'Oh, he's got me hooked. He's making me blush.' 'With a sideways glance, He's got me head over heels.' 'Oh, he's got me hooked. He's making me blush.' 'With a sideways glance, He's got me head over heels.' 'He's walking away. He's making me sway.' 'Making me want to bridge the gap, He's got me mousetrapped!' I've known Kavin for 10 years. I was the one who taught him the trade. With his knowledge, he could have bought this city. But he lacks discipline and focus. That's why he is like this! Heard he gambles a lot. He has lost so much money! That's his only minus. 'No rules, no morals - There ain't no boss; More money, more money - Make no noise!' 'No savings, no hoarding - That's how we roll; We feel no fear - We stand tall.' 'No rules, no morals - There ain't no boss; More money, more money - Make no noise!' 'No savings, no hoarding - That's how we roll; We feel no fear - We stand tall.' 'No rules, no morals - There ain't no boss; More money, more money - Make no noise!' 'No savings, no hoarding - That's how we roll; We feel no fear - We stand tall.' I called him up last evening... He said he has 6 lakhs ready... and that he'd give the remaining 2 lakhs within a week. Now he says he doesn't have the money. Are you playing games with me? Of course not, brother. - What, then? I took the money. Suruli doesn't know. You gambled? You lost it all? You lost all 6 lakhs? In one sitting? Did you know that was money owed to me? I knew. Bring him in. - Okay, brother. Come on. Drag him. He borrowed money for a premium interest. He didn't repay it on time. I've locked him in my warehouse for three days now. Four of my boys... - Please save me. They're practicing their punches on him all day. Take your hands off me. They just don't hit him here. Ask me why! Why? In another 3 days, I'll cut him open and sell both his kidneys. Since I know you guys well, I'll give you one week's time. - Please show mercy. 8 lakhs, with interest for 7 days. I need 9 lakhs on my table! Or else... I’ll kidnap this guy! You lost the money, but I'm going to lose my kidneys? Get an ATM machine ready. If we need to raise 9 lakhs, we need to make 7 machines. We need to find 7 dimwits. I don't see that happening. We don't have another option. Meet the lathe workshop guy tomorrow, and get the ATM machines ready. Did you meet the lathe guy? He screwed us over. He will start work only if we pay him a lakh upfront. I've given him so much business! I used stronger expletives. He wants to see the money. I'm going to... He won't do it even if you beat him up. Want some tea? Buzz off. We need a lakh to take even one step forward. That's the situation now! I stashed that money under old sacks just so you won’t see it... But you somehow found it, and lost it! How much do we have now? One, two, three, four, five... six, seven, eight, nine and ten. There’s another 10 on my feet! Just buzz off. I don’t have money even for a cup of tea, and you’re asking me? Kavin? Hi! Why is she smiling like that? Who is that? She even knows your name. Auntie said you're coming only tomorrow. Auntie? - Even she reacts the same way. She asks me to call her 'mother' instead. I'll get used to it soon. She means your mother! But you said your mom died. I saw in the news that it’s raining heavily in Kolkata. I've been visiting temples these last 3 days... praying that there shouldn't be any rain when you're piloting flights. Pilot? Flights? I'm learning Bengali. By the time we get married and move to Kolkata... I think I'll be able to converse fluently. By the time you learn Bengali, he’ll vanish! Who are you?! Why are you so aggressive? Actually, I came here to withdraw cash for auntie's treatment. I can withdraw from my bank only at 10:30. She wanted 1.5 lakhs for her treatment. But I only had 1 lakh in my account. Should I give this cash to you, or wait till auntie is here? Dude, random men are hitting me! I have no clue why. I am having a bad time. Don't let go of this chance, just grab it. Come here. - Wait, I'm coming! I don't know what to say, I feel so nervous. Auntie is here. She just messaged me. She is waiting around the corner. Shall we go? You go ahead. I'll follow. Come, let's go see your mother. Auntie! Kavin... your mother! I didn't think I'd be running into him here. She didn't think so either! Right, mom? Auntie... No need for that. You take leave. I'm here now. I'll be with mom, and take care of her treatment. She works at a cell phone shop. We met while we shared a cab. Her parents were looking for a groom. I said I'm looking for a bride for my son, who works as a pilot in Kolkata. Is it wrong to make use of an opportunity that knocks on my door? You make use of whatever opportunity you get! Why did you use my photo? You expect me to show his photo? She'd have fled in an instant! I've been working on this for three months. All my hard work has gone to waste. Hello? - How is auntie doing? Did you give her my number? You haven’t changed that number yet? You usually change your number every two months! I told dad that she isn't feeling well. He asked if we can visit. Not now... She's in the ICU. Oh no... Nothing to worry about. I'll call you when she gets discharged. Okay? When I saw your photo, I liked you right away. But I was a little scared that you might not like me. If that girl crosses my line again... you're dead. Hello? Hello? He hung up! Why did you refuse money that came our way? Did we ask for it? - Stop it! Are you mad? - She came with the money on her own! I'm going to beat you to death. How are we going to repay Dass? We were getting 1 lakh in a platter! Look at yourself! She works in a cell phone shop. How much do you think she earns? Her dad is a security guard at a garment shop. So what? We'll find a way. Let go. What? Let go? He's scratched me all over! Did you just say "Let go"? Suruli... - Take your hands off me. Easy for you to say. - Where are you going? Your kidneys are safe! - Come on! Suruli... Your kidneys are safe, right? Dude, wait up! I'm leaving for Pondicherry early morning, with my friends. You already told me. - Another girl, and three guys. I'll be back only on Monday. You have no problem with that, right? Three guys? What is this! She was born in Dubai, and grew up in Delhi. If I make a fuss about this, she'd think I'm uncool. I need to show her I'm hep! But we aren't hep! Now look at you! You're burning with jealousy. One of those guys is mad about me. He sends me flirty messages every day. He is a tall, rich guy. Looks real smart. I think he just messaged me. This is so you don't forget whose girl you are till you return from Pondy. 'My pair! My soul mate! The blink of your eyes, makes me freeze.' 'My beautiful! My precious! With you, my world begins and ends.' 'When you are around, My phone turns speechless.' 'When you tilt your head and smile, My tea tastes a lot sweeter.' 'My pair! My soul mate! Your sweetness makes me melt.' 'When we walk with clasped fingers, For ages that sensation lingers.' 'My pair!' 'My heart wonders, when I think... At what point did infatuation become love?' 'My heart is panting, when I think... Of the point our love turns to lust' 'On some days you clean my body, With the sweet sweat from your body.' 'Once you are pleased with my services, You gave me back my clothes.' I quit my job. Why? Try watching six movies every week and reviewing them... you'll see why. He proposed marriage. I said yes. When? After I return from Delhi. I'm going to Delhi first. For my friend's reception. College reunion after that. Then, North India tour. I will be away for 20 days. You told me. Fool! What? Don’t you want me to remember whose girl I am? 'My pair! My soul mate! Your sweetness makes me melt.' 'When we walk with clasped fingers, For ages that sensation lingers.' 'When you are around, My phone turns speechless.' 'When you tilt your head and smile, My tea tastes a lot sweeter.' 'My pair! My soul mate! Your sweetness makes me melt.' 'When we walk with clasped fingers, For ages that sensation lingers.' 'My soul mate!' Please pull over. The money isn't due for another 2 days. What did you do these 4 days? You can't do squat in another 2 days. So... Kavin? Where is Suruli? - In my warehouse. You need to settle the account before dawn. I won't accept part payment. You have one day's time. - Heard that? Then, I'll cut him open and sell him part by part. Thanks guys. Toast to all. Thank you! Enjoy. Couldn't have done this without you all. Thanks, guys. Thank you. What's this party for? The construction isn't complete, but all units have been sold already. Thank you, guys. Have fun, everybody. Buddy, I need some money urgently. You could have asked me last week! Business has been terrible these last 2 months. Why don't you ask Annachi? Do you have any surety? Give me a week's time, buddy. You're in trouble with Dass? No one will give you any money. What is it, girl? You haven't touched your food! I'll tell you something if you promise not to tell dad. What? You know auntie, right? Kavin's mom... She isn't Kavin's mom. She is basically a fraud. The entire group! Everything they told us is a lie. What do you mean? The money she asked for her treatment... If we had given that money... we'd have lost it all. Shall we go to the police? But Kavin didn't take the money. He could have taken it if he'd wanted to. That means he is a good guy, right? Who could it be at this time? My mom's condition has suddenly worsened. They need to perform a surgery right away. I need some money immediately. All my money is in fixed deposits and bonds. I couldn't liquidate it in such short notice. Do you have any money with you now? I'll return it next week. What is it? Nothing. It's okay, baby. It's alright, baby. Thanks. Shall I have a word with your father? He is working night shift. Anyway, this is money I earned. I saved it up for my dowry. You don't need to ask him. I'll call you in the morning. Kavin... Do you know my name? Sorry... How is the party? Are you enjoying? - Sorry, excuse me. Excuse... Buddy, I'm off. - How can you leave your own party? I need to be at the land registration office tomorrow morning. Okay, you take care. - Bye bye. Okay, guys. Bye. - Bye. Have fun! 'KAVIN' 'EZHIL' So arrogant. Always throwing the rule book in our faces. Do you know why she got transferred? - I don't know. She helped a culprit in her previous posting. Really? - She almost lost her job... She got a three month suspension.. - She deserves it! Everybody, out. What sort of training did you get? - She's here! Sorry, madam. - Don't contaminate the crime scene! Yes, madam. Sir... Sir! Who informed us? - The house maid. She was out of town and returned only this morning. The killer has put the body in the tub, and turned the tap on. The maid was the one who closed it. I don't know if we'll find any evidence. So the culprit has forensic knowledge? Did you find the murder weapon? I looked for it but couldn't find it. It doesn't look like a knife wound. It's something else. Point of entry, sir. The murder should have taken place at this point, sir. The victim's name is Akash. He doesn't have a mother. His father lives in America. As if we didn't have enough of a workload already... Look for a good restaurant and get some nice coffee. Okay, sir. Malar, you handle this case. First, inform Akash's dad. See if Akash has any relatives locally. It’s my younger brother. See if there is any money or valuables missing. He always has money at home. But it's not there now. How did you arrange the money? How does it matter to you? You got your money. Release Suruli. Doesn't look like you got the money through the trade... So I wondered... 9 lakhs in one night... Even I can't manage that! Go! Move your leg. Why did you give me the money? You knew I was lying. But you still gave me the money. Why? What if I had just taken the money and left with it? If you had just left with it, I'd have found it easy to forget you. You'd have found it difficult to forget me. The inspector isn't interested in Akash's case. Let me be frank, madam. We've been doing the rounds for 3 days... This case has reached a dead end! We have no witness or evidence. I don't believe we'd see any progress. You're the one hanging on to it. Come to the station after the enquiry. - Okay. This house was locked that night. The security guard says he got drunk and passed out. He didn't see anything. Did you ask around the entire stretch? I did, madam. Most of the houses are unoccupied. People come here only during some festival or holiday. There are people who don't even own a single house... And these people have built such big houses to party once every year! Stupid rich men. Get in the jeep. - Yes. Let's check the street behind us. - Okay, madam. Give it. - All the details are here. Sir... Malar wants to see you. I'm talking here! She says it's urgent. I already made her wait for half an hour. What? - Sir! Sir, I’ve been enquiring in Akash’s locality for the last three days. There was a party in the house behind the murder site that night. The house owner is from Coimbatore. His son hosted the party. I have traced him and asked him to come from Coimbatore. He is outside. Come to the point! - Sir, this is his cell phone. This is a selfie he took with his girlfriend from his balcony. The timeframe matches with the timeframe of the murder. Sir, zoom into it and look at the left side. I know this fellow! His name is Ezhil. Former IIT student. Forward this picture to all stations through hue and cry. Find his current address. Set aside all other work, and concentrate on this case. Yes, sir. You're dead! Mr. Ezhil? Hello? Can you hear me? Hello? Anyone out there? What do you want, sir? I've been locked up since 10 am. They've taken away my phone, too. They're not giving any reasons, either. We asked him to eat but he refused. What's your problem with Akash? Akash who? - C.S. Akash. 3rd Cross Street, Neelangarai. I don't know any such person. What's happening here? They said they wanted to talk about some case for 10 minutes-- Where were you last Sunday night? I was in my office. At a party. You left your own party midway. What was the hurry? I need to be at the land registration office tomorrow morning. You take care. Bye. No particular reason. I had a headache. A headache? Didn't you leave early saying you had a land registration in the morning? But you never went to the registration office on Monday. We’ve enquired. Did you lie? Sir, you’re trying to frame me because we have a history. What did you say? Get up. Last Sunday, you left your office at 10:30 pm. You can reach your home in 20 minutes. But you came home only by 3 am. Where were you? My car had a puncture on the way. - Where? Natesan Street, Little Mount. Does it take 3 hours to fix a tyre? Half an hour sir, at the most. I didn't have a car jack. I had to ask around for help. A cabbie drove past me, but didn't stop. A couple of cars stopped. But they didn't have a jack. Finally, a call taxi guy came. He helped me. What call taxi? I didn't notice. Registration number? - I don't know. You don't know which call taxi... You didn't notice the registration number either... Suddenly a Good Samaritan turned up, helped you and left? Lift him up. Akash died last Sunday. He was killed. Someone stabbed his neck repeatedly with a sharp object. Why are you telling me all this? You neither knew Akash... nor went to 3rd Cross St. Correct? This is a picture of you in his balcony that night. This evidence is sufficient. Out. Forget your future, business, and everything else. Your life is done. I'm going to bury you. The inspector is trying to frame me. I'm innocent. We have previous enmity. Give me my phone. I need to talk to my lawyer. There is a problem, sir. - What? He was caught for drunken driving. The Vyasarpadi station inspector sent him after seeing the photo we circulated. He is sloshed. He can't even say his name. He got drunk and ran his motorcycle into the police jeep. Bring him to the store room. Where were you on the night of the 2nd? I don't remember. If you beat me up like this, I will forget where I was this morning! Sir... You had chicken biriyani and prawn fry for lunch. Correct? Buy me one chicken biriyani and one prawn fry. Sir, my friend wasn't feeling well on that day. I spent the entire day with him. I got him medicines and food. I went home at night and slept. Your friend's name? - Suruli. He has a shop at Ricky Street. You continue. Note down his friend's address. The inspector is here. Step aside. Give the phone to the PP. Srini, can you come over to the station? It's urgent. 24/12, Nehru Nagar, Vyasarpadi, Chennai. Look guys, he's got a ladies' hankie! You were acting so cocky... Aren't you ashamed to have a ladies' hankie? What other lady things do you have? Check him properly, sir. He might have things like lipstick, hairpin, rubber band etc. Look at him staring! Should I beat him up some more? Sorry, madam. He's crashed into a police vehicle, sir! You get drunk and-- Madam. Was that yours? Gowrishankar Sharma vs State of UP, 1990. Sir, he is talking about some Gowri. Who is Gowri? - Head constable... Gowrishankar Sharma vs State. He is talking about some judgment. Judgment? What about the judgment? Any form of torture, cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment is prohibited. What is he saying, sir? It is a crime to hit a suspect. Not just hitting. Even mistreating a suspect in any way is a crime. Haven't you read the judgment? How arrogant! Prithipal Singh vs State of Punjab. The court suspended the entire police station for hitting a suspect. The ones who hit, the ones who watched on... everyone! Is he a lawyer? Iyappan, hit him in such a way the bruises don’t show! The court gave an eight year sentence to the constable who instigated the torture. Rigorous imprisonment. You don't know about Rahigit Singh vs State of Haryana? The head constable is in the same prison as the convicts he put behind bars. To this day. The police constable who beat the suspect is also in the same jail. Dhanapal, you hit him. What now, madam? I sprained my hand. Or I'd have thrashed him! Let's wait for the inspector. Sir! Lock him up in the cell. Srini... - Go in. Lock it. - Okay, sir. They look like photocopies of each other! This is the only evidence. This evidence is a total waste now. Have you booked Ezhil? - I have brought him in for questioning. You can't keep Ezhil locked up like this, GK. Why? He runs a construction company. He must have contacts. I got you here hoping you'd give me some useful advice. Srini, I'm retiring next month. I won't get a better chance to take down this guy. GK, I know that you two have a problem with each other. I'm talking as your friend, and also as the Public Prosecutor. The problem is, we have another guy who looks just like Ezhil. That too, he got caught at another station. From his arrest to his handover to you, everything will be on record. If it wasn't for that, we could have killed Kavin... and closed the case, claiming Ezhil to be the man in the selfie. What are my options now? Tell me that! Did one of these two commit the murder? - Without a doubt. Is there a chance that a third person did it, and not these two? Not a chance. Then one of them is lying. State in your records that you booked Ezhil on Sunday. Today is Friday. We have 2 days. We need to produce them at court on Monday. Before that, find out which of them is in that selfie. 'EIGHT MONTHS LATER' Hello, sir. We're making a documentary about Akash's case. We want to interview you. My face won't be seen, right? No, sir. We will blur it out. Initially, the investigation was slow. But eventually, the full team really got into the case. We didn't leave out any information. For two full days... we worked day and night. None of us got any sleep. Give me some water. - Here, sir. Ready! The inspector was pushing us towards one direction... The sub-inspector madam was pushing us in another direction. The whole station was shaken up those two days. 'EIGHT MONTHS BACK' 'DAY 1' We need to produce them at court on Monday. So, we only have 2 days... to find out if this is Ezhil or Kavin. Till they admit the truth, don't give them any food. Just water. And more importantly... Ezhil shouldn't know that we have another suspect in our custody. Similarly, Kavin shouldn't know that we have Ezhil under custody. Both of them must think that they're the only suspect. Got it? - Yes, sir. Strip. I said, strip! What's that wound? I got hurt at the construction site. Strip. Stop it, man. I meant your shirt. What's this? My bike skid off and I fell. 'EZHIL' 'KAVIN' We beat up both of them. Even gave them an electric shock. They're saying the same thing over and over again. One of them is playing us. We need to find out who. We only have that selfie as evidence. Even that's useless now. I don't have a clue how to take the next step. Let's dig into Akash's history. The answer must lie there. Let's gather all the information we can - his friends, hobbies etc. If we find out who Akash is, we can find out who his killer is. He mostly stayed at home. He rarely went out. He played video games. He played his guitar. He used to browse the internet for hours together. They say you were Akash's best friend. We played in the same rock band in college. After he went to the US, we slowly lost touch. Why did he return? He said he didn't like the US. He didn't have to earn. His dad sends him money every month. He was a good man. When my son had typhoid in February, he took care of the expenses. He refused to deduct it from my salary, too. Akash didn't have a circle of friends. He was the only friend Akash had, that too during college. Did he have a girlfriend? He was a little awkward with girls. There was some talk that he loved a girl during school. But the girl apparently ignored him. I think his confidence took a big hit after that. He didn’t show any interest towards girls. His world was just music and computers. Do you recognize him? No, sir. Do you know him? No. I was down with fever on the 2nd. Kavin got me tablets and food. He left at 11 pm. Basically they're both frauds. But they don't operate in the city. They do it in other places. Any cases filed against them? They mostly target Seths who sell contraband. So none of them filed any complaints. His case dragged on for years... It was Kavin who found some legal point and got him acquitted. How does he know so much about the legal system? I won't do anything. Tell me! He seems to know all the legal loop holes. You say he's only completed 12th grade. She's asking you. Where did he learn how to bend the laws? He used to say "If you hang out with the cops..." "you can learn a lot about such stuff." Ezhil's life is pretty clear. He studied at IIT, and worked as an engineer. Now he has his own construction company. Go on. But I don't understand Kavin's history. Suruli has known him only for three years... It's not clear what he was doing before that. Get the other people who know Kavin. - Okay, madam. Constable. - Madam? Be a little cautious when you're enquiring about Ezhil. No one should know he is under our custody. 6:10 PM Did you check Ezhil and Kavin's phone records? I did, madam. None of them have any connection with Akash. Between Kavin and Ezhil? - No, madam. Kavin, Ezhil, and Akash... all three of them have completely different circles. As far as I enquired, everyone had only good things to say about Akash. Doesn't look like he had any weaknesses. Akash's sister mentioned he always had cash at home, right? Yes, madam. Get Akash's bank statement. - Okay, madam. You shouldn't leave town without intimating us. Okay, madam. There is cooked beans in the fridge. Heat it up for dinner, dad. I'll be late tonight. Okay. An entire day just flew by. We only have one more day left. We're just going in circles. The case won't move without additional evidence. We're missing something, constable. It's right in front of us, but I don't know what it is. Constable? What does the inspector have against Ezhil? The inspector's only daughter was in love with a boy during college. That boy was from a different caste. Our inspector is very particular about that. When he heard about her love affair, he found a groom from his community. The day before the wedding, the girl eloped with her lover. Till date, we don't know where they are. Till date! The man who helped them at that time was Ezhil. Why did Ezhil help them? All 3 of them were from the same college. The boy and Ezhil were classmates. The inspector wanted to finish off Ezhil back then… but he couldn't do anything as Ezhil had strong contacts. Now he’s got a chance to get back at him legally. He won't let it go. Hello? This is Bhagya from Forensics, madam. Forensics Bhagya... Who gave him my number? I gave it to him. He asked for it... Tell me, sir. Akash's case is solved. What? Yes, madam. Akash's case is solved. He says Akash's case is solved? We're breaking our heads here without a clue... and you're saying the case is solved? Before we get to that, I've been meaning to ask you this question for six months now. What? Give me an honest answer. Why did you turn me down when I came to ask your hand in marriage? Don't irritate me. I'll hang up. Okay, I'll get to the point. Our guys have found a hair sample from Akash's bedroom. The killer's hair sample? I took samples of everyone who comes to Akash's house and tested it. There was no match. Who else’s could it be? You just round up the suspect... I'll check for the DNA match and confirm it. You asked for additional evidence, didn’t you? We got it! He thought he had destroyed all evidence... But he wouldn’t have dreamt that a single strand of his hair... was going to end his story. Even we didn't expect the case to end so soon. 'DAY 2' 6:40 AM What? - I need to go to the bathroom. He's been throwing up since morning. Didn’t I tell you he wouldn’t be able to take the beating? It's not because of your beating, sir... It's the liquor I had the day before. - Shut up, man. Your beating actually felt like a caress! Before you leave this place, you'll be crying at my feet! Keep an eye on him. I'll go home and be back. Okay, sir. Wear your shirt and sit there. You shouldn't move an inch. Go! Muruga... - Sir? Keep an eye on him. I'm going to the toilet. Okay, sir. You've been asked to use this. Sir! Sir... Sir, someone please come. He is running away. Someone open the door! Sir! Stop. Rajesh, Velu... He is getting away. Catch him! Velu, wake up. Keep an eye on him. I'm going to the store room. Is anyone down there? Muruga? Rajesh? Stop! Muruga! Velu! What's that noise down there? Check what's going on. Get off, guys! Come here, man. Rajesh... Listen to him. Come quick. Stop it, you guys. Sir, don't let them go. I'll get the handcuffs. Stop it. Pull them apart! Stop it, you guys. Let go of each other. Oh no. They're wrecking the station. No! He is going to shoot. Here. Call the Sub Inspector. Sir, come immediately. Kavin and Ezhil are hitting each other. Looks like they might just beat each other to death. Stop it, guys. Constable, grab him. You pull him that side. - Sundar! Rajesh! Grab him, guys. The arrogance on this guy... I'm going to thrash it out of him. He hit the Sub Inspector! You're playing with me? Trying to escape? Lock Kavin in a cell, too. You dare hit the Sub Inspector? You dare to hit a cop? Did you notice, sir? They already know each other. Sir, there is so much blood. Looks like he broke your nose. You think he hit me on purpose? No way. Looks like it just happened in the scuffle. There is blood on your back. I think it was a piece of glass... it's burning so bad! The results have arrived. - Really? Didn't I tell you the case is solved? The killer is in your custody. He is the killer. Otherwise, why would he try to run? Will you try to escape again? Will you? The sample you gave is a perfect match with the one found in the bedroom. Who is the killer? You’ve sent two samples.... Yeah, two suspects. There is one small hiccup. - Hiccup? Both their DNAs matched. Both their DNAs matched? What are you saying? Isn’t it impossible for two people to have the same DNA? Even a son's DNA is different from his father’s. Kavin and I are brothers. Identical twins. I was born 16 seconds after Ezhil. Do identical twins have the same DNA? Yes. Even fraternal twins don't have identical DNAs. Identical twins are formed from the same egg. They look identical. They would also have identical DNAs. If the men in your custody are identical twins, this DNA would be of no use to you. Are they identical twins? Yes, I think so. We had that doubt, but we couldn't ask them. We decided not to let them know that we have the other person in custody. I get it. First, we got photo evidence. That turned out to be of no use. Then we got the DNA. What more clinching than DNA? Now you're telling me that's of no use either. What can we do if all the solid evidence we find turns out to be of no use? Don't get vexed. I've been researching that since morning. We have science to help us. There is a simple method to find the killer. Even in the case of identical twins, the fingerprints are different. Even if the DNA is the same, would the fingerprints be different? That's the beauty of nature. But we found no finger prints at the crime site. I'd have sent it to you otherwise. You know how our department people work! I'll send you two people from my team. Visit the house again. See if we might have missed some prints. You said the killer destroyed all evidence. - Yes... See if he might have left behind some print without realizing it. Even if it's a partial fingerprint, we can close the case. Searching the same place again! It's so frustrating. If there was a fingerprint, we would have found it. The house has also been cleaned. Is it something that can be bought in a shop? I feel like having a smoke. Come on... If that ogress sees us, she’d give us a piece of her mind. I'm going in. The forensic guys are coming here next. It's not like we can see fingerprints with a naked eye. The forensic guys are coming here anyway. Why is she dragging us into this unnecessarily? Damn! Madam... - What? Why are we here? For evidence, madam. And what are you doing? Evidence, darn it. Am I hiding the evidence in my bottom? Yes, madam? Your guys said they couldn't find any new fingerprints. Is there another scientific way to solve the case? Scientific... There is one method that is scientific. But it's a little difficult. Whatever it is, tell me. You need to use your police brain now to find the killer. I told you it is difficult! Mom and dad had a love marriage. Both their families didn't accept them. My dad was a lawyer, mom a bank employee. They had compatibility issues. They didn't get along. - Ah! They didn't realize that when they were in love. They found out after marriage. When they got divorced... Ezhil and I were six years old. I went with my dad, Kavin with my mom. Who is my father? - I am! Who is my mother? - I am. Who is my life? - I am. I heard your mom gambled... that she used to go to clubs? Did Ezhil tell you that? I'm going to-- I'm going to kill that mongrel. Let go. I'll crack your knees. Just sit down. I'll rip your face apart. I'm seated. Let go of me! This is the first time I'm hearing about a woman who goes to clubs. First time we're hearing it, too! That too with her son. - No wonder he's turned out like this! Some mother! My mom was the first graduate in her family. University gold medalist. Didn't Ezhil tell you about that? After she finished college, the bank came knocking at her door with a job offer. If anyone came asking for help... she'd just give whatever she had. Didn't that dog tell you any of this? The doctors said he will survive only if we perform an operation. This is all I have. Sell this, and manage your expenses. It's because you ate fried food on an empty stomach. From tomorrow, we are not going anywhere near the club. I don't know how and when she developed the gambling habit. It's a form of disease, too. Today, it even has a name - Ludomania. Who knows what emotions ran in her mind? She had it under control for several years. She didn't have a happy marriage. Pressure. Stress. It triggered her. Every human being has some weakness. For my mom, it was playing cards. Does that make her a terrible mother? You guys take bribes, right? Does that make you terrible fathers? 'KAVIN - 13 YEARS OLD' Mom? I lost this month's entire salary. What am I going to do? Why are you probing into our past instead of enquiring about Akash's murder? Please understand this about Ezhil. He is a compulsive liar. All he does is lie. If he says ten things, eight out of those are lies. He underwent psychiatric treatment for one year. You know that? Did he say I underwent psychiatric treatment? Call up Salem Mental Hospital and check... whether it was him or I! From age 16 to 17... Who spent one full year in there? Enquire and find out for yourself. Please go and enquire! 2006 to 2007. They just locked Ezhil up for one entire year. The fork we use to eat...? He stabbed the Chief Doctor's neck with a fork... and the doctor was fighting for his life in the hospital for one month. Go ask him. He'll tell you story after story. Go ahead and ask the doctor who stabbed him - Kavin or I. Your case will be solved right there. What you said is true, madam... He was a lawyer's son. Just because the doctor said something, he stabbed him with a fork. The boy's name? I need to know his name. I don't know. That incident happened before I joined work here. No one who worked back then is still around. But I've heard those stories. I've seen that chief doctor. He developed a speech impediment after that stabbing. He died only last year. Wasn't the boy a patient there? You must have records. The record room got wrecked because of the floods last year. I dumped all the records in the warehouse. If I find anything, I'll send it over. My brain is already fried... and one of them is a psycho? I'm going home tonight. One of you take over my shift. What is Kavin's problem? I don't know. He was like this when he returned home after mom's death. Rage. Mania. Brutishness. He was always the problem child. How did your mom die? Jaundice. That's what dad said. How did your mom die? Jaundice. There is something mysterious about their mom's death. I think Kavin might be the only one who knows the truth. Collect any information you can about their mom's death. Okay, madam. Mom? You're Lakshmi's son, right? - Yes. I am your mother's colleague. I found her lying on the road. Looks like she lost her salary. I took her to the doctor. He said she has high BP. He wanted to run some tests. Looks like she hasn't been eating well. Call me if you need any help. Your mother has my number. Okay? Who is my father? Who is my mother? Who is my life? Nothing like what you think happened, Kavin. Come here. Look at mom. I don't care what people say about me. You are my life. What you think about me is all that matters. Your mom isn't that sort of a woman. What kind of a person am I? Did I give birth to you just to see you cry all alone at night? My father was so strict. I mustn't stand by the window. I mustn't talk to the neighbours. I mustn't return late from college. I thought I was escaping hell... but ended up in a different hell. I won't gamble any more. I swear. My prince... How did I end up making you cry? What kind of a mother am I? I won't go to work today. I'll make you milk pudding. Let's eat, and go watch a movie. Okay? Come home straight after school. No football today. Okay? Only then will I believe that you trust me. After my mom died... - Come... My dad brought Kavin home. - Come in. Kavin had several complexes. I had everything he didn't have. Dad? How is that my fault? I was scared to even look at my dad. He was so distant. Ezhil didn't treat me like his brother. I felt like a stranger in that house. He'd be at home for six months... then he'd run away. He'd come back... and then run away again. 'KAVIN - AGE 16' He was dismissed from every school my father put him in. Bad friendships. Bad habits. Get up. - Sir, who are you? What are you doing, dad? Like mother, like son. Don't talk about mom! Stop it, guys. Let go, dad. - Just stop it. Kavin, stop it. Ezhil! Stop it, guys. Enough. I said, stop it. Let go, dad. - That's enough. I wish you people had died instead of mom. I joined college after that. It was my father's wish that I study law. But Kavin was the one interested in it. But he didn't have the discipline to attend college. He discontinued his studies within a year. He'd come home occasionally... steal something, and leave. He had only one obsession in life. Me. No matter what I did, he was fixated on doing it better than me. I know three languages. Kavin learnt six languages. When Ezhil was in the final year of college... our dad passed away. After that, I lost all contact with Kavin. I found out that Kavin was following me only very recently. My life was on a smooth upward curve. I finished college. I landed a well-paying job. Then, I started my own construction company. But Kavin's life was stagnating like a pond. He couldn't take that! Jealousy. Anger. Hatred. He dated many girls... but didn’t have a single girl who truly loved him. What did he steal? A solitaire ring. I got it for Deepika. Do you know any cops? I don't want to register any case. - I'll take care of it. They say he doesn't have the ring. They held him in the station for 2 days, and let him go. I didn't take that ring. It's in the top drawer of your dressing table. Go check. There is a photo of mom in your house. I only came for that. They broke my hand at the station. The doctor says it will be bent even if it heals. I'm urinating blood. Just know this, Ezhil. You'll be in this same situation one day. And I'll be the reason for that. After that, I’m only seeing him now. He is trying to frame me holding that grudge. What he says is very clear. Sir, can I say something? He is lying, sir. If he did nothing wrong, why should he run? Hello? Stay on the line. Sir, the inspector is calling you. Ganesh... - Madam? What is it? I don't know, madam. The inspector asked you a question yesterday. You never answered it. What question? You had an office party on the 2nd... but you left early. You told your friend you had to go to the registration office. But you never went to the registration office the next day. Why did you lie? Tell me, don’t be afraid. If you tell me the truth, I'll make sure nothing happens to you. 8-4-2-0 5-5-5 0-0-0-1 The inspector's daughter's number. Yes, madam. My husband and I came to Chennai that day. Ezhil came to see us. We had a lot of debt here. We asked him for help. He gave us some money. Why are you asking me all this, madam? Is there a problem? No. I couldn't tell the inspector I went to see his daughter. If he finds out where they live... he won't spare them. Constable, lock the door. - Yes, madam. Where is the inspector and Bhaskar? - I don't know, madam. They both discussed something and then they left. Who knows how to open a lock... without a key? Everyone knows, madam. I need Ezhil's car keys. You still suspect Ezhil? On the night of the 2nd... he said he was stuck at Little Mount for over 3 hours because of a flat tyre. I canvassed the whole area. We couldn't find one witness who saw him there that night. I checked with all call taxi agencies that cover that route. I couldn't find the guy he told us about. Madam... Ezhil's car keys. Now we'll know whether or not he was speaking the truth. I had a flat tyre on the way. Yes, madam. It’s punctured. In case the police come looking for you... - The police? Tell them you weren't feeling well on the 2nd. They'll leave. But before they come the second time... flee! Why? What did you do? How did you pay back Dass? It’s none of your business. Won't you check if the vehicle has enough diesel? Sorry, madam. This is an old jeep, and it's just guzzling diesel. Madam? Kavin's friend... he's gone missing. He's gone missing? I had informed the local station to keep an eye on him. But the house is locked now... and they say he's gone missing. Aren't you ashamed to let him escape and come up with excuses? Madam, one minute. You asked us to check Akash's bank account. He withdrew 12 lakhs the week before he died. The day after the murder... Kavin repaid 9 lakhs to a loan shark. The inspector received this information by around 6 o'clock. He told us to keep it from you. Where is he? Get down. Sir. Come. There was a theft near Minerva theatre on the 2nd. At a jewellery store. Unsolved. The inspector is framing Kavin for that. Place your hand here. Is he trying to setup Ezhil for Akash's murder? If Kavin was at the jewellery store on the night of the 2nd... He couldn't have killed Akash. Correct? That would automatically mean Ezhil killed Akash. This is just a theft case. Even if he admits to it, he'd be out soon. Don't let anyone know that I told you. Only if the call taxi driver who apparently helped him... comes forward, can Ezhil be saved. That too, only if what Ezhil said was actually true! He asked you to place your hand on it. What for, sir? Idiot! He is saying it for your own good. The money from Akash's home is missing. You repaid a loan of 9 lakhs the day after his murder. That one point is enough to get you hanged. Sir, I won that money gambling. What? There is this Marwadi called Ashok Seth behind Adayar Sheraton. Go ask him. We play poker in my house once a year. The minimum stake is 1 lakh. I only have a lakh. Kavin had come on the night of the 2nd. He played all night. He won 10 lakhs. The AC is a good friend of mine. You may leave. Okay, sir. Case solved. - Tell me. Ezhil killed Akash. Sir! Step aside. I need to talk to him. Sir... Our troubles have come to an end. - What? Akash's murder is solved. Akash was killed by Kavin. The call taxi driver who Ezhil mentioned had helped him... it seems he has come to our station. Remember, I told you way back. That Ezhil is innocent. We were canvassing that area for 2 full days... saying if the call taxi driver is for real, he must report to us immediately. He apparently returned from Theni only this morning. He heard about the news, and turned up here. Have you questioned him? I did, sir. He is genuine. When that call taxi driver came to the station of his own accord... It became obvious that Ezhil couldn't have committed that murder. If Kavin had won the money by playing cards... There is no need for him to kill Akash. We were back to where we started. Take it to court, GK. Let them decide. No other go. The department couldn't do anything more. The case went on for eight months. Finally, the day of the verdict came. CC 225/2017 Ezhil, Kavin. Come. It felt like our heads would burst waiting for the judgment. Come here, both of you. Step forward. You come forward, too. One of you is a murderer. I have no doubt about that. Inspite of several adjournments... The prosecution couldn't exactly prove which of you two did it. That's the problem. I want to lock the criminal behind bars, but I don't know which of you two did it. I can give a verdict only with the facts presented to me. Public Prosecutor? The law doesn't allow us to imprison them both. Because one of them is innocent. We can't punish him. A hundred criminals may get away, but no innocent person must be punished. That's the way our legal system functions. I have no other go, but to free both of them. All of us were stunned by the judgment. No one expected a judgment like that! Aren't you the Investigating Officer? - Yes, sir. This is a black mark on your department. Despite knowing one of them is the killer, we have to set them free. If both of them were set free, who is the actual killer? I don't know. 'AFTER THE VERDICT' 'ONE WEEK LATER' Madam... Things need to be shifted to the new station... Your table hasn't been cleared yet. I asked you to put the photos back at Ezhil's house. Why are these still here? - Sorry, madam. It got missed out. Give it to me. I'll send them back through Senthil. What, madam? The case has been going on for eight months now. But she never came to see Ezhil. I asked him way back. He told me they broke up right after he got charged and arrested. What, madam? The first day... We showed Ezhil the selfie when we got him in for questioning. You remember? Do you remember? He saw the photo and went silent. He never said that it wasn't him but his twin brother. This is Malar speaking. Sub Inspector, Neelangarai Station. Tell me, madam. You said Akash was in love with a girl during school, right? That it was one sided? - Yes. What's the girl's name? Deepika. We're missing something, Constable. It's right in front of us, but I don't know what it is. 'ONE MONTH BEFORE THE MURDER' Deepika never came to Delhi. She said she'd come, but she never did. I tried calling her back, but her phone was switched off. Thanks, Divya. Ezhil... I don't know how to tell you this... A friend of mine spotted Deepika with a man at the Vijaywada Railway Station. It seems like... they were hugging. I didn't want to tell you about this... No, Divya. You are mistaken. Someone witnessed it, Ezhil. Deepika isn't that sort of a girl. Forget her, Ezhil. Stop torturing yourself. She hasn't gone missing. She is gone. Even her mom doesn't miss her. You're the only one still looking for her. You said she was with a man, right? Who is he? Deepika's classmate from school. His name is Akash. I spiked Deepika's drink. She fainted. Then I took her to Vizag... and used her like my wife for 2 days. Then I killed her. I made it look like a drug overdose. I spent 10 lakhs to make the case disappear. She believed till the very end that you'd come for her. 'NOW' They've sent us the records from Salem Mental Hospital. It seems they have all the records except for the ones you requested. They found a copy among the personal files of the doctor who got stabbed. They've sent us that. Who was in the hospital? Kavin or Ezhil? Both of them. Ezhil was here for three months. Kavin, an entire year. When they were in the 10th grade, they almost beat each other to death. Did you read the last paragraph? Read the doctor's handwritten notes. "No matter what their differences are, if there’s a problem they team up." At first, I thought you came just to give me trouble. Eventually I understood you were there to save me. What's this? He got drunk and ran his motorcycle into a police jeep. He was caught for drunken driving. Who crashed into our vehicle? Even a month before you killed Akash... I knew you were looking for him. You destroyed the evidence. But you didn't follow the investigation. I did. I knew you'd get caught anyway. An airtight case. You would either get a life sentence, or get hanged. The doctor states that till the very end he didn't know which of them stabbed him. The mental hospital doctor didn't know who stabbed him... So he punished us both. But I knew that the court can't do that. I thought you can get away only if I get caught. So I just decided to take this gamble and took the plunge. Salem Hospital reports? - I stole them. Even if they find it, it's going to prove nothing. I knew that Inspector GK would go to any extreme to frame you. I'm going to bury you. The Inspector can do anything he wants. He is the King card. I needed a trump card to beat that. I studied Malar. What happened, madam? He played me from the moment he entered the station. He made sure my concentration never went towards Ezhil. I knew she had previously helped two innocent people. I thought if I played my cards right, she might help you too. No one apart from you and I know that I arranged for the call taxi witness. And no one should know. Malar won't let go of this case. She will crack it somehow. She would have found out the truth by now. What are you saying, madam? I don't understand. She can't reopen this case. She arranged a false witness for you. If she opens it, she'd get caught. That's it! This case is over. Who played what, madam? The truth will be buried with Malar. It's nothing. This is the biggest gamble I've played in my life. I went all in, and I won. Now I've lost the desire to gamble. Why did you help me? You never liked mom. But she never forgot you till the very end. If she bought me a shirt, she'd buy one for you too. She'd utter your name in her sleep and cry. If she were alive, she'd have wanted me to help you. I did it for mom. Not for you. I'm going to get married. The girl's name is Anandhi. I'm starting a new life. You? I have sold my properties. I'm going to Bombay. And then to Copenhagen from there. I don't intend to come back. This is the last time we'll be seeing each other. 'This scarred heart - flows like a stream; It's an infinite dream.' 'Crashing against your wave... I'm nothing but a reflection, my love.' 'This scarred heart - flows like a stream; It's a restless dream.' 'In my sandy shorelines... You're etched like footprints, my love.' 'With the smile I wear on my face; And the tears I carry in my eyes.' 'My heart heavy with memories... I walk ahead.' 'One day, you drenched me with your love. Then why did you dry away so soon?' Happy birthday! I don't get a gift? Shall I unwrap the gift? If only I'd trusted my mom that day, she wouldn't have died. After all these years... I'm able to understand her. I want to apologise to her, but she's not here. 'Aren't there flowers in this valley, That will bloom just for me?' 'Aren't there clouds in the sky, That will shower me with joy?' 'You made some dreams come true; And you burst some bubbles, too.' 'Your loss being a searing pain, You've taught me to fall and rise again.' What will you do if I don't come back? I'll be searching for you, all my life. Akash's case is truly unique, in this whole world. There is no other case like it. Not really. Such cases have happened around the world. Really? - Yes, sir.
