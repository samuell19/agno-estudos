We have the prettiest and the nicest dogs, in and around the village. The winner is Arthur the Dalmatian of the Prchlik family from Klokoci. Hurrah! We're the prettiest, they bought it. You know, someone has to win. Well, Prchlics, congratulations. Nice, the hops are blooming. Perfect aim, son. Liba? Liba! We just put grandma in there for you. But the first of June is tomorrow. I'm in a terrible crunch, I can't keep up at all. We have to make arrangements for the holidays, it's high time. We're going to Italy in July. So you'll be taking Grandma in July and we'll have her in August. We want to go in July too. - You can't be serious! You can't compare Italy with a camp in neck of the woods. You can go there in August. Am I right, Karel? You can do that, sis-in-law. Come on, Bro! What about the harvest? Anything can be arranged, right Korinek? And what's in return? Let's have a drink and see about that. - Have a beer. Arthur, Arthur, also sweeten the victory. Right Arthur? This is no contest. What is it? The nicest winner? You're jealous. Neckyada, that's racing. I wonder what you can do there with your winner? The nicest one! Get some tub and make sure it doesn't leak. We will show you with Arthur, you'll see. I'm coming, I'm coming. We're bringing your Arthur, he was at the train station. Thank you very much, boys, God will repay you. I'll close, so he doesn't escape. Poor little thing. Granny. Heathens! When you're getting a live thing, take care of it! Some boys found him and brought him in. Granny! - Granny, we're bringing you a winner. Now what's this? How's that? There was one and now there are two. Oh, my. - Oh, boy. We have a visitor. The c-c-carnival barker. - Oh, yeah. Here. Where did you come from? Who did you run away from? Come here! Stop freaking out! What's that? Well, what's that? Stop it! Yuck! Forgive me, Liba, but I really didn't recognize him. He rushed in, how could I know he wasn't yours? Doctor, I'm sure you'll know. Who's got a Dalmatian around here? Yes, Dalmatian. Not to breed, we had this thing happen. Well, how am I supposed to recognize him? Well, well, well. I've been here one month, the other at Karel's. It's all getting mixed up. Holy Mary. Pass it! What's that? He's- he's- he's mine! Hop! Get the ball! Just take it! Wait. Now you've bitten through it. A carny. Maybe he's a sorcerer, we'll call him that. Merlin the Sorcerer Like in the book. about the Knights of the Round Table. Merlin, come! Me-Me-Merlin! Slow down. I'm sure Mom has called the whole county by now. She even got at St. Peter. And you're messing his head up with someone else's name! I might've got at even St. Peter. Nobody around here misses a Dalmatian. What are we going to do? - He'll be here for now. I'll call the police tomorrow. Go. And I'll place an ad. Such a beautiful dog. Someone must be mourning him right now. Oh, yeah. Arthur could never do that. - H-He could. B-b-but he d-d-doesn't have to to p-p-prove anything. Slowly, Monica. Prove. - There you go. You monster, that was for the whole family! You messed us up, Gran. Come on, buddy. The fair is over. Guest in the house, cane in the hand. Shush! You got a good lightning rod out of me. - You are back again? You got a good lightning rod. We need to lock the door. Where are the keys? Get out. H-h-he won't be here alone. He wants to be around people. These are for the shed. If you weren't fooling with him, he'd have left already. It's always Granny's fault. If you could talk, you'd stick up for me, wouldn't you? But we'll shut ourselves off from the other one. Hand me the broom, I don't want to stand here like an idiot. Thanks. We we we... - Slowly. Very slowly. We'll take him in for the night. - No way! Why not? He'd be out all night Ma! - Lie down! See, you know how to be a good doggo. Good night. If you need anything, knock. Honza, what do you think? How long does it take for an ad to come out? I don't know... He'll be with his master in a week. Just hope so. It says here, Merlin was a great maggi. Maggi? You mean mage, right? That's a big difference. Yeah, the Maggi's for the soup. He was a terrible sorcerer who knew the wildest magic, he was casting spells on people, summoning a dragon out of the mist... I read here he only contributed a negligible amount of energy to the power grid. And I read here that he stood faithfully by King Arthur's side and advised the brave knights. - What did he advise? How to jump into bed. It's almost nine. Arthur! Good night. Lord, take care of our menagerie. and all the Prchliks. Granny, good night. Good night. Good night, Granny. - Good night, good night. It is written in the books, that King Arthur's knights gathered in this hall around a large round table. At that moment, there was a flash... the thunder crashed and a large round table appeared. Granny, keep everywhere locked. Make sure he doesn't meet Arthur. Merlin will be locked upstairs. - Don't mess it up again, granny. Oh, hush! I'm going. Mess it up. It's going to be a f-f-f... - Fun. When we get home from school, there'll be three Dalmatians here. Don't scare me. We will found the kingdom of Arthur. And we'll have little Arthurs and little Merlins. Lots of charming puppies. Hi, cousins! Want to see something cool? So what? We have other things to worry about. We have a new dog, Merlin. And because he's a sorcerer, we might have a puppies, too. You're bullshitting! But you won't see this again! I'd borrow it. - Tomorrow. Hey, kitty. Mind your own business. What's wrong? Fear came over me. I'd rather go home. Granny alone is not enough for two dogs. - No way! Bye. Arthur, I'm all overwatched. Thank God. They're coming. I have Arthur with me. Where's Merlin, Granny? He's been upstairs all day and he's been on his best behavior. And the puppies? - What? What puppies? Arthur, they're making fun of old Granny. You know? Oh, what a stink! Me-Me-Merlin! Granny, you never let him out! At least to the attic. I guarded him! You let him go! Nothing happened on my watch. Merlin! Merlin! Merlin! Merlin! Come swimming, Arthur! Arthur, we have the same shirt! Arthur, we have the same shirt! Girls have shit in their room! On the carpet. - Get on! Where to? - After Me-Me-Merlin. We cleaned everything up. - Will they find him? I hope not. He finally figured out what to do. To look for his master. Arthur wouldn't stay with strangers either. I'll teach you a lesson! What are you doing here? Monster! You're scaring my cows! Get out of here! Arthur! Stop it, you scoundrel! Arthur. What's got into you? Come here! Don't run from me! Come on! Arthur, stop it! I thought we were friends. Arthur, come on... Stop it! Run to the Prchliks, tell them to come get him. He's weird, maybe he's got rabies. Or something. Where do you have Merlin? - We don't have him. But we got something for the neckyada. Because of Merlin. we've done a lot of scouring! He's gone, and I'm sad. He took the shortest route to his master. You didn't do watering again! It's just like Karl's. That witch dried my agave last year. Don't call sister-in-law witch in front of the kids. It's not nice. But... She's a witch. Mr. Prchlik! My dad says,... Arthur's gone mad! Speak of the devil and in he walks! Oh, my God! Here he comes again. Arthur! Arthur! D-D-Dad! Arthur! For Christ's sake, rabies is a terrible disease. Ondra, get the first aid kit from the car. And you go get water. Until what time are they at the vet? You want to go somewhere with this? It's closer through the fields. Lord, take care of our menagerie. Watch over us day and night from the evil and the evil might. Your papers, please. That's going to be expensive, Mr. Prchlik. - Go to hell, guys. All you know is how to pull money out of people. And when someone's life is in danger, you are stalling. Liba... - It's true! I'm sorry, ma'am, but step out of the car. A vehicle in this condition has no business being on the road. To let them take your license like this. What will you do at work? If you hadn't screamed, I could've talked it out. Who was screaming? Me? - Not me, for sure. No, you're frozen with reverence in front of the uniform. It's not your fault, Arthur. Oh, boy, that's love. Fifty pounds, that's burdensome. They drugged him? - No, they didn't. Do you hear that? Oh, my! Granny, where are you? This is a disaster! I locked him in the woodshed! Four of you can't handle one dog? We were catching rabbits at Pepek's. Take him somewhere far away. One horror after another. One horror after another. You were supposed to watch him. You let him in, and then you pretend it's none of your business. - Liba, please... It's always just "Liba, Liba", and who's going to pay for it? - You're looking for a culprit where there is none. But there is. - Oh, yeah. Okay, if there's one... You stay here! If there is one, so be it! What are you doing here? I don't need to be here either. Well, neither do I! Where are you going? - To the pub! Nobody argues there! Well, clean it up! Where did you put Merlin? - In-In-In... In the bathroom. Well, he hasn't been there yet. Dung beetle. Jesus Christ. Oh, look! You're here? Come here, I've been thinking of you. I brought you something. Look at this! Well, it's not your fault. It's my cheerful nature. Oh, my. Liba! Liba! You have me here. Wait! Oh, well. Then we'll sleep together, buddy. That's what we got. There it was. You've already gone past it. - You need to g-g-g-g... Go back! - What are we supposed to do? Don't get ahead of her! Even I know she wanted to say go back. - Oh, okay, whatever. Kids, tell mom she needs to double clutch. You need to double clutch. Kids, tell Dad they have a real piece of junk at the co-op. You have a real piece of junk at the co-op. Tell mom, you have to be able to drive even with this kind of junk, and to leave it to a more experienced driver. You're meant to leave it to a more experienced person. A more experienced one shouldn't lose his license. Tell that to Dad, kids. Say it yourself for once! Come on, Adela. Yay! The Hound of the Baskervilles! Get in the car! Ahhh! Are you looking for someone? - We heard you lost your dog, so we brought him to you. You mean that little one? He's shrunk somehow. You're not supposed to wash him in hot water. A real dog looks like this. Right, Rex? Let's go home, come. They're not leaking! We have to win this year. We'll all sail, Arthur and Merlin. We'll make them friends before the neckyada. They're our dogs! So don't decide about them for us! You order your rabbits around. There's only one dog that's yours. Anyway, why the hell am I forcing myself on you? Don't leave, P-P-Pepa! Our Adela, she sometimes mo-mo... - Momming. You're right, we'll make the dogs friends. Like the Knights of the Round Table. What round table? Like this, without corners and edges. At a table like this, everyone is equal. Everybody listens to the other's opinion and don't beat him up for it. And who's going to walk that barker from upstairs? Now, here's where you can run. Come here. And without Arthur. You'll be free as a bird. Well, go! And I'll read to you, what the papers say about you. "A Dalmatian was found. Who misses him, contact the address: Jan Prchlik, Klokoci 1 3 7." What do you think? Merlin! Merlin! Merlin! Merlin! Where that dog... Merlin! Merlin! Damn dog. Merlin! Where you're always wandering? You're supposed to be helping. Dad! What do you know about Arthur? - About Arthur? So What? He's bitten through and stitched up. Prchlik's making such a fuss. The animal has to help itself. Not this Arthur, King Arthur. There is some King Arthur? In Monaco, right? I don't know anything about that. Yeah, well, as long as you know everything about beer. What did you say? You better go home! I'm going to get lectured by you! Like hell! Prchlik, where are you fleeing to? - Oh, well. If you were going to leave him in the woods, you're out of luck. He ran home as if his ass on fire. And my shoes are vanishing! You had nice jog, huh? Me too! What are you doing here? Oh, I'm sorry, Liba. It's your fault, you thief! Ondra! You're going to buy the eggs! Dad will give you the money. Ok. Ondra! Where's that kid? Arthur. Let's get you a treat. You're going to be chained now. You can whine in here, all you want. Merlin, let's go get the eggs together. Sit! Sit! Good Merlin. Wait here, I'll be right back. Good boy. Hi. Well, Arthur, how come you won't let us in? He won't let us in. Arthur, get out of here! Go! Let's get out of here! - Merlin! I'm calling your dad! Have him get his belt ready! And don't bring Arthur in here again! That's not Arthur, that's Merlin. Dan! I brought Merlin here for you, look. I see who's leading who! He's pulling you along nicely. - Nice, isn't it? He's more fun than Arthur. - But, he's Arthur. Watch out, Mom! Who you got there? Arthur! Get out now! Did we buy a purifier because of a dog? Arthur, come on! Aunt, that's not Arthur! Ahhh... What kind of hygiene is this, bathing with the dog! Hi, Dad! Hey, it's 7:30 already. Your dad's not behind the wheel? - Now that he doesn't have his license... I forgot my homework. Go on, I'll catch up. See, Arthur, I've got you both in my charge again. Granny wouldn't be able to handle you. We don't need any more trouble. Be good, Merlin. I won't leave you here long. Don't worry. Stay! Headmistress! Come to the boiler room! What? There's something raging and whining! If I believed in ghosts. Anybody there? Who's there? Ahhh! A chimney sweep! That's our Merlin. Calm down, kids! I've had enough! Line up! So! There's that intruder. What is this! School is not a pigeon house. Prchlik again. Get that dog out now! No. No. Madam Headmistress... Prchlik? You go back. Your mischief is increasing exponentially. In addition to your mom, the class meeting will include your Dad too. Out! Out! Go! Don't bark all the time! Get out of here! Well! Hello, postmistress. What are you bringing us? What's so soon? - A registered letter. What in God's name is that chimney sweep? Is that Merlin? I thought Dad took him to the fields with him. Yeah, Dad. Ondra took him to school. But don't tell our parents, Granny. Ondra is in detention and we'll give Merlin a bath. Ha ha, I want to see that. I'm really curious about this. Okay, good boy, you'll be handsome. Ahhh! - Oh, my goodness! Are you all right? He's a terrible demon. I'm terrified of him, too. Ahhh! Ahh! No! No! Madam Postmistress! Please! Don't say that anywhere! Ahh! -Madam Postmistress! -No! - We'll carry your bag. After a shock like that, I'd need a week of bed rest. Damn Prchliks. All I hear is nothing but complaints and more complaints. Did they pay the last fine? - No, they didn't. Send Prchlik a new subpoena and a new money order. Honza or Karel? - Honza. That goes without saying. But send it by mail pigeon or something. I'm not going back in there. "Dalmatian who lost his master lives with us. Prchlik family, Klokoci." Y-you have to swim. You want to be number one again. Come on! Get in the water! Don't play sick anymore! You're a king. And the king must set an example. Even if he doesn't want to. Come on! What a hero you are. Well, there you go. Come here, my spotted one. I only see one. Where's the other one? Have you ever seen the two of them together? That's right, I didn't. Could it be that they're conning us like this? Pepek, come! Let's try it on the water. Is that Merlin or Arthur? I'd say Arthur. And they're setting us up. Hi, Granny. My parents went into town, so I'm supposed to be in your care. You can go with Ondra and Pepek to walk the dog if you want. Would you like a bread roll, Danny? Wait a minute! Mom's gonna be mad, because I didn't give you anything. "Would you like a roll and butter, Danny, Mom's going to be mad." Morons. Fetch! Ahhhh! Help! I'm drowning! Help! - He can't swim. Help! Dogs! Dogs will fight. See, they have two dogs. - Aah! They didn't fought. You swam like a c-c-couple. But two adult dogs can't have the same master. Our dad was right once again. - Oh, yeah. Your dad. What he can know, since he's never had a dog in his life. A gamekeeper! - What are you babbling? As it happens, he once had. A dachshund. I'll ask my dad, what if we could take Merlin. Ha ha, more like we will take him. - Oh, yeah. You. With your pool. You would like a dog? You'd spoil him. Look at you. Like master, like dog. How come, when you're in the water swimming together but you fight on dry land? I was embarrassed In front of the headmistress. You all lied. No neckyada for you. - No! Ban everything, but not the neckyada. Dad, please, we have to win this year. We-we-we-we... We have a perfect vessel. They'll all be amazed. - We-we... We want to achieve something more. - And what is that? Befriend Arthur and Merlin, so they don't fight. But you can't. - But they don't fight in water. Mommy, say something to Daddy. I can't say anything to dad. You know why. So, did you enjoy your meal, Arthur? Get in the room. Come on, you devil. You're making a mistake, dear girl, for not talking to Honza. And it will go from bad to worse. From bad to worse. Jesus Christ! Don't go in there! Wait! Get away from one another! Get apart! Didn't you hear? Get away from one another, you miserable bunch! Come on! Come on! Hush! Stop it, please. Come on. There you go. That's what you get, from not talking to each other. And it's only going to get worse. It's going to get worse and worse. I don't want to be here anymore. I don't want to see or hear anything. A gamekeeper without a dog is a laughing stock. No dog. And shut the clapper already. And definitely not that vagabond from Prchliks. But, Dad. We'll train him. You'll see. It'll work. You're not going to stop? Didn't you hear Mom? You only have a hunting license to kill. What did you say? I'll give you a killing! I'm going to kill you, you...! That would be horrible, to be a dog and have you as a master. You little bastard! I've come for Merlin. My parents allowed me to. Just take him away, Dan. No. I'm glad. I'd love to pack you Granny too, who's responsible for it. - But, Mom! Granny is n-n-not... - You be quiet! Both be quiet. It's either me or the dog. Right. It's either me or the dog. The two don't go together. Stop it! There's someone in Dan's room. - What? - Some guy. Daniel! How dare you bring that animal to your bed? You said, rather than a migrating granny, You'd like to have a dog permanently. Uncle's got two dogs, a cat and three kids. And I can't have anyone, no siblings, no dog, no cat. Even my granny is only migrating. That' s enough. Karel, call them to come for that monster. No! Hey, bro, we didn't agree on this. We're taking turns with Granny, but... taking turns with dogs is out of the question. I should have known Dan was lying, when he said you two allowed him the dog. Our Dan's not lying. Go home. Never. It's always you who is called to the school. I wonder why? I don't think that belongs here. That animal doesn't belong here either. Definitely not here. Then put him in a shelter. To the shelter? You'd like to put them all to a shelter. Granny, too. Well, see, now you're talking about it, I almost forgot. Karel, tell them, will you? We can't change that term for the Italy. So I insured it with the nursing home. You can' t be serious, bro. You wouldn't make a decision. It's bound to happen one day anyway. One day. But not today. You didn't ask us. Nor Granny. She doesn't want to go there. Oppose it all you want. You know what it takes to get on the waiting list? -Money! I don't care about your money. Come, Liba. It will be this way. Granny will stay with us. Forever. Granny forever. That's generous, but you didn't discuss it with me. I thought... - Another load for me, not for you. I don't have to put up with it. I'll leave. Let granny take care of the kids, the dogs, the cat and... Chickens, mice, ticks, fleas, I know. So, we'll go with him tomorrow to the shelter. To the... - Don't talk, it's always bad for you. We're going home. - Come. I'll take care of it, Liba. Trust me. I'd cancel it all. It's all the same. Only murders. Ha! Fine, yeah. Now we'll have pay the fine for him, for an outlander, now, when every penny counts. It's getting better and better. Eagle. You're the one coming with me. I'm glad, because we're going there on your account. Come in. Hello. Hi. What are you bringing us, Ondra? Money. You don't say. Dad doesn't make that much money now. They took away his license. And they took it because he was driving Merlin. No, Arthur. They've both been bitten by now. In short, I pay for everything. and that's it. Oh, boy! Merlin! - What's up? He's loose again. Get lost! You really are something, aren't you? Now, get out. Get out. Get out, you flea bag. Get out! Move! Are you crazy, Josef? He'd only bark at me once. I can't even tell if it's their dog or the vagrant. No vagrant! He's ours! He's lying through his teeth. Arthur is obedient. This is that vagrant. Merlin! Get in with him, Ondra. I'll drive you home. What about Dad? Is he still fuming? Get in. - Never. Where did you steal it again? Phone! Ondra Prchlik. He wants a dog. - Is he nice? Mister, are you nice? Don't ask. Find out. Mister, I'm to find out... We don't have the dog anymore, goodbye. Who was that? Well, who was that? He wanted Merlin, but he wasn't nice. And how do you know that? - I just know. Okay, so as of today. I'm the only one answering the phone. Mom's annoying me. She just walked away and left everything here up to me. She didn't even look at our homework. She did the laundry, b-b-but she didn't hang it up. I'm not even worth a bit of hot meal to you. I can see it now, starving to death with you. She must have left us. She said she had enough promises and a tit for tat. Is that what she said? - Yeah. Well, we're a broken family now. Where do the Prchlik's live? - I'm Prchlik. Okay. So you're offering a dog? How it's written here. - Not us. My uncle. I'll take you there. - Get in. Ladin, you smart-ass, it's been a while since you've been seen here. What a coincidence, Pepa, huh? I don't forget. I'll give you a little more time. I'm going here. For the dog. Yeah, Prchlik. Oh, yeah. I'll take care of that for you. I'm getting along fine with him. It won't cost you a cent. I'm guessing right, why do you want him, huh? That's okay, they want to get rid of him. Hey, kid, get out. Thank you. We'll handle the rest. Come on! - Heel! Arthur, heel! Heel! Sit! Sit! Come on! Sit! Adela! Children! Come here with Merlin! Oh, yeah, you're a showpiece, I'll tell you that. Don't bite me! Don't bite me! Nice. Well-fed. What a pelt, hmm. Poor doggie. From place to place, it's is not good for any living thing. Take care. Ladinek from Loucky. You know him? Dad knows him. Too well. And that's enough for me. I'll take a look at this deal, out of pure curiosity. You're going home now. And don't tell anyone, Adela. I have a good sense about these things. Leave it to me. If only there was a sausage, right? Monica, would you peel this potato for me? My hands don't serve me anymore. So what? They're overcooked. Who was cooking? - Who do you think? Thank you. - Here you are. Don't look at me like that. You'll eat what everyone else eats. We sacrificed Merlin, and Mom is nowhere to be found. Come on... Don't be so cuddly. Or I won't be able to do it. Well. Shh! Quiet! Shh! Well... Quiet. "Merlin has a master already." Admit it, they conned me again. He vanished from the garage. - What? He vanished from the garage. Come on! What a monster. So he can open the doors all by himself? Don't bullshit me. I hate this kind of jokes. What do you mean? When someone makes fun of me. You're offering a dog and your boy steals it back. What? My boy? Stealing? Yes, your boy. That's enough. You're going to pay me this time. I'm not going to give you any more time. And fuck off with this! Damn it! What's your deal? You wanted a pelt? You'll get a pelt. Pepek! Pepek! Where do you keep hanging out? You're supposed to be at home, not wandering all the time! Neighbor, are you mushrooming, too? And with a gun? Have you seen our Pepek? The boys went to walk the dogs, both dogs. Your Pepa too. Pepa went with them. Chop it up, girls, I'm hungry as a wolf. Thick Prchlik's soup, right, Adela? Of course. First meal together of the Knights of the Round Table. And you, mage, and you, Your Majesty, will eat side by side. Don't make us to call the vet. Soon the dogs will be fighting and the Knights of the Round Table will be over. What a dumb idea. Wanting to befriend them Dogs from hostile packs. Why hostile? I have a feeling, we're being spied on. You have this for neckyada, right? Yeah. And don't tell anyone. Everybody knows you're banned from the neckyada. We're going to win! And the winners will have all forgiven! Remember that for life! - Ouch! Merlin's running away! Me-Me-Merlin! -Merlin! Merlin! Stop! Arthur, quick! Not into the woods! Merlin, come back! Arthur! Merlin! You're not allowed in the woods! There you go, you vagrant. I'll finally get you. I'll take you down, you beast. You scumbag. They'll pair up like horses. They will not fight! You are finished. - Nooo! Ahhhhh! Dan. Danny. Wake up. Finally. The doctor said, it's just exhaustion. Sea is awaiting us, sun, swimming. Karel, stop it. Don't you see when you start talking about the sea, he gets worse? He's putting on a show. That's doing of that bunch of his. I hate this. - Oh, please. What kind of bunch is he in? He's always alone. I'm going to straighten him up. We'll work out at the seaside. We swim at least a kilometer every morning. I'm not cutting him any slack. - He doesn't want to go. He wants to stay home. Don't you get it? All right, then. We're going to bring Granny back and the darling will be home. - And why not? We're not going to sunbathe there, I'm going there as a representative of the company. I see. - Business is business. Oh, okay. I'm just curious, how you're going to explain this to your brother. You're probably going to get your ass kicked Look who came to visit you. Merlin! Come here. Oh, my boys. To live to see this. You see, doggie, how we ended up. They pulled a gun on you and own brothers are fighting over me. I don't even want to live anymore on this bad earth. But we'll find a better one, where we won't be a burden to anyone. Forgive me, doggie, when I was mean to you. You and I are in the same boat. Nobody wants us. Please forgive me for everything. You're going to help me to have the strength to reach that happy land, aren't you. You're a sorcerer after all. Here. He was at Dan's! Merlin was at Dan's! He was there! Oh, boy. I'm glad you're here, Liba. She left her meds here, too. - S-S-She didn't even eat dinner. Shouldn't we call the police, after all? We can do this on our own. They can't be far. And they don't have a magic pathfinder, don't they, Merlin? Will he want to track down Arthur? - You'll see. All right, let's go. He's got a whole goulash of smells in here. - B-b-but he will c-c-catch on outside of K-K-Klokoci. - Yeah. What would make Granny want to go to a cold old castle? She's scared as hell of rheumatism. Merlin of course. She wanted to run away with him. Since they're b-b-both burden. But she mistook the dogs. The dungeon - Oh, come on. His teeth hurt. We're ready for bed. It's getting late. Oh, my God. What if it rains up there? It's just dripping here. Align the vessels! Three, two, one, start! Go! Go! Go! - Go! Go! - Hi! They shouldn't have brought both dogs, it's going to end badly. On the contrary. It's off to a good start. Oh, my God, kids! Leave him alone! At least Ondra will learn to swim. I have to count them to know, how many stayed underwater. It's better with two, right, sorcerer? Isn't that right, Arthur? Arthur! Merlin! For the win! Arthur! Merlin! - Arthur! Merlin! Hurá! Vyhráli jsme! Vyhráli jsme! Hurá! This year, as you're about to see, the top prize will go to the doggies. I'm asking a spotted crew, to come to the podium. Congratulations. Well done, Prchliks. And a little surprise. A great gift for the big pack. Next I'll even sail through the weir! Next I'll even sail through the weir! Hurrah! Jesus Christ, Liba, you didn't put the film in. The last vessel is approaching the finish line. Granny! Granny! The Prchliks have won! Granny! Granny! The Prchliks have won! I'm a Prchlik too! I'm a Prchlik too!
