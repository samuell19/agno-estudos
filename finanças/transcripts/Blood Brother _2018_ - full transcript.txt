Hit the gas. Hey, you remember when we say, "We go straight to hell"? You say what? I say, "When do we leave". - I went there, Sonny. - Yeah, you made it out. Put the past in the past. Woo!

I need you to get out of town. Go someplace. I don't even need to know. I will call you. I... I don't understand. You're in danger, Darcy is in danger. Until I know what's going on with Jake, I can't have you at the house. Megan, go! Now! Detective Carson is on the scene. Are you okay, Sonny? Jesus. Will you tell me what happened here, Detective? Not sure myself, Lieutenant. But you and the suspect were here together. - We got that right? - That's correct. - His name is Jake Banning. - Banning? Juvie that did time for that armored car heist. What the fuck were you doing with Jake Banning? I know him from school. He asked for a ride, I gave it to him. Then, he just snapped. Hey. Darcy, right? I'm sorry. I didn't mean to creep up on you like that. - You are? - Jake. Friend of Sonny's. Oh. That Jake. Guilty. Sonny and me, we were gonna see you play, but he got caught up with something. Oh, really? Same old story. He said you grew up to be a pretty good kid. He didn't emphasize the pretty part. You're such a liar. Sonny probably said I was growing up too fast. He can be such an ass. Probably why he didn't come. Nah, trust me. He got caught up with work. So, now you're sticking out for him? He really wanted to see you play. Look. Sonny wanted me to give you this. He didn't have time to wrap it. Here. Look at that. You know, it looks good on you. You look like a hot nun. With that little old dress cut so spare. A nun? - Yeah. - You don't know me. That could change. Right? You've been in prison, right? Yes, but you know, I made a little mistake - when I was about your age. - What kind of mistake? I thought I had friends I could rely on. You're different from Sonny. I don't see you two being friends. Uh, maybe you don't know him like I do. Maybe not. Hey Kayvon, it's Sonny. I'm at Joe's house. Jake maybe coming for you, call me back. Yo! Joe! Hey, yo Joe! Donna! Darcy! Where the hell have you been? - Nowhere. - Well, we need to go. Come on. Fuck, Joe. What the fuck is going on, Sonny? Getman is all over my ass. He wants to know if there a connection between you and Banning. Joe Williams is dead. I need... Uh, as many units as I possibly can get to Kayvon's house. I need your help, partner. How much do I wanna know? It's bad for me, Lorna. It's way worse than any of the shit - we've ever been through before. - Shit. - What the fuck do I tell Getman? - I don't care what you tell him. - You'll figure it out. - You owe me. Add it to my bill. River Park is where we used to meet up and lay low after shit popped off. Hardly anybody was ever there. Jake said he was just getting started with his payback. That's all demons do, destroy everything you love. I had to finish this. How's your day going, Officer? Wee! Hey now, still warm. Hold on tight. Sonny, unbelievable. Look at mama, just textin' away. Paying no mind to her baby girl. What's this world coming to? Hey, you remember the first time we met? About hour off that bus, you tried to rob my white ass. We beat each other for about an hour. Both got suspended. First... - Second grade. - Second grade, you remember. That was a start of something epic. Something we always had, - respect. - Yeah, we had that. Yeah, well, you hurt my feelings, bro. - Becoming a cop. - I just found Joe. Yeah, 15 years inside. It's funny what you're capable of doing. You know I always thought that there was a code, honor, friendship, something? But I had what you call... an epiphany. - What was that? - No such thing as code, honor - or friendship. - So, this is your plan? Yeah... I'm just wingin' it. After 15 years, of being told what to do, when to pee, when to poop. My brother, it feels invigorating. Hey, now! Uh-oh. You know what? The cashier and that lady at the store... - You didn't have to do that. - I want you to know what it feels like to be me. What it's like to be fucking helpless. I've paid the price. Now you're gonna pay. You could've killed us last night. Yeah, what fun would that be now, huh? You know, we're having fun now, brother. Come on, baby girl. - Oh, my God! - Run to your mommy. - Mommy! - Come here! Put that gun down. Okay... watch me now. What's that? - Huh? - Where the fuck is Darcy, Jake? - Sonny. - Where the fuck is Darcy? I'm gonna call my brothers on Darcy's phone tell 'em where I am with that money and what you owe? Well, use your imagination now. Put your gun down. Whoo! Let's go now. Clips too, player. Go ahead. Spin that over. I said, spin that shit over. Don't move. Toss them keys to that sweet ass ride. For fuck's sake. Which gun should I use? I don't know. So many choices, so many guns. - Where you going? - What do you want? Bang bang! I want 15 years. I can't get you that. Your life will have to do. I'm right here. No. No, no, no, no Sonny, your death is for later. I want your life. Sit down, right there. Put them handcuffs on. You know how to use them handcuffs? Go ahead. Mm-hmm, there you go. Imma go see Megan. See how she's feeling. - Fuck you, Jake. - You don't got what it takes to stop me. Not yet. Fuck! - Hands off my freaking car, man! - Police, out now! - Let me see some ID. - Get the fuck out. Fuck, man. Where's Darcy? Check on her, right now. Darcy! Darcy! - Sonny, she's not here. - You gotta get out of the house. - No So... - Listen to me, listen. Hey, hey. I'll call you right back. Tell me what is going on... Sonny, you should see this place. - Jake, where is she? - Oh, you'd love it. - The service, impeccable. - You touch her, I'll fucking destroy you, Jake. You know that, right? You and your inbred fucking racist brothers, your mom, your whole family. If you touch her... Oh, now I'm starting to hear it. - Yeah, you're hearing what? - The real you, Sonny. Fuck you, Jake. - Where is she? - Sonny, you ain't no cop. You're a fraud. That's why you're unhappy. Why you can't even make it stick with Megan. Don't you... Don't you say her fucking name! That's why you can't even be yourself. You touch her, you're a dead man. - You know that, right? - You promise? Do you? Pinky swear? You don't have my stuff in an hour, my brothers gonna do a little more - than just touch her. - I got your money, man. Just let her go. Let her go and it's yours. Sonny, I'm losing you.

They're not even together anymore. Ring, ring, ring. Today, she totally flips out. Says we have to leave the house. - Yeah, I know. I ditched her. - Hm, you should call her back. No, let 'em wait.

I got some stories. You won't believe the shit Sonny used to get up to. - How bad was he? - Pretty bad. You know, his mama was my mama and my mama was his mama. We slept in the same bed together. Watched the same cartoons. We robbed the same jewelry stores. It wasn't always like that. We weren't always kicking people down the stairs, taking all their welfare checks. Spending it on weed and just acting foolish. He thought he was gonna go to art school. Fucking Michelangelo. Sonny Michelangelo. He wasn't too bad. Except that around here, becoming an artist is like a... finding a halo in hell. Good luck, partner. Even though he's my brother-in-law, he... ...kinda acts like my father. I kinda miss it, I guess. He's not really around anymore. We gonna bring Sonny back around. I'll show you Sonny. I'll show you Sonny. Shit. I had it since I was 14. You seemed so distant sometimes. And, all these years, I thought, it was because of somebody else or something else, but it was this. I can make it up, Meg. I'll tell you what. You... you owe me now. Go find Darcy. Sonny... - This ain't the way. - Change of plans, baby girl. I got your money, let me talk to Darcy. - What money, Sonny? - Darcy, where are you? Uh, I'm just out with some friends. Darcy, the man with you is very dangerous. I'm not playing around, tell me where you are. - More dangerous than you, demon? - What? No wonder you and Megan didn't work. She thought you were a good guy. Listen, I don't know what the fuck Jake has told you, but, I need you to listen to me. Just the truth. You don't have to worry about pretending - no more with Megan either. - Darcy, tell me where you are! Hey, Sonny! You need to fix these brakes, boy. Hey, you relax, bro. We're just going to a party. Have a little fun. Hey, you remember Emilio, don't you? You send him to the hospital with that traffic cone? You wanna come? Let her out of the car and I'll meet you. - You got what I asked for? - I got the money, man. It's yours. Just let her go. I'll see you there. - What was all that about? - My inner asshole turning out. They say you are the same age when you leave prison as you went in. I was 14. - Maybe this is a bad idea. - Hey, Sonny going to be there. You don't like the party, you could leave. I promise you. Ooh, he likes you. - How you doing? - What's wrong? My cousin not good enough for you? No, it's just Jake and I was supposed to go to a party. Oh, but baby... Take the seat, Frankie. Come on, baby. Emilio. - How you doing, brother? - So, so Sonny. Today seems a little complicated, huh? Yeah, it seem that way. Fucking with a cop's family, that's new heights... - for even you. - Shit, I know. But, times is hard, man. You know the kind of cash I gotta drop today. Send my kid off to college, you know what I mean? Real criminal shit. - That sound like your problem. - The more I make, cop, the more you motherfuckers take, man. Just let her go, she ain't a part of this. But you made her a part of this now, man. - Call your man, Jake. - Let her go. Well, you know whose shop this is? Rustle this shit up. What you all waiting for? Search him. Jake pay you yet? I ain't think so. - I'm the bag man. - Damn, Sonny. You got some stones, man. Cop coming in the jungle, unarmed. Slapping folks around, conversating, fraternizing with the felons. - It's okay. - Sonny boy, do me a favor. Kick that bread over. Who tryin' to make 700k? Any one of y'all put a hole in his head, it's yours. Seven hundred k, put a hole in his fucking head, you got it. Y'all niggas don't want no money? Shoot this nigga! Nice Sonny, I'm loving it! Let me see what's in this bag. Hey, Jake... think this about 700k. Emilio? You're a man of your word. Little friendship we developed behind the wall. It's uh... rapprochement. Something you and I supposedly had, Sonny. Don't die on me, Sonny. Gift in your pocket. Go ahead, get your breath. Anything happen to her, y'all motherfuckers gotta deal - with me, you understand? - Only if you believe in reincarnation. Shit. Hold on, hell no, not in here. Y'all go ahead and kill his ass. Use the motherfucking storage room. Good day, Sonny. Fuck you, Emilio. Fuck off! Shit man, you can have the money, man. Sorry about the mess, motherfucker. Where you at, Sonny boy? Where you at? Ah! Right on time, Sonny boy! Here you are! Come on, Sonny. Fuck! Oh! Fuck! You might have to hold the wheel, you might have to play along, baby girl. Here we go, baby girl. I see where your daddy's goin'. - I see you, baby. - Sonny, watch out! Oh, shit. He's not coming back for you. - You don't know Sonny. - Say another fucking word I'll put your fucking brains on that little window. Where are you taking me? What are you gonna do? - Jake. Answer me! - Hey, don't ask questions you already know answers to. Fuckin' bitch. Sonny, Sonny. Stop! Please, stop! Go ahead, finish it. Right here. Do it in front of my mom. - Be a man like you used to be. - Leave him alone! Do it for Joe and Kayvon, people you used to really care about, Sonny. Do it 'cause I sent them to hell today. - Sonny! - Uh, so disappointed, bro. - I thought you were ready. - I got him, cuff him. Keep looking, you might find something you like. - Come on. - You see that? Sonny keeps it hidden in his house but it's there. - Yeah, what's that, Jake? - Himself. Demon. Get this guy out of here. Can you excuse us a sec, Darcy? You okay? Three million's missing from that armored car Jake Banning went down for. All right, then 15 years later, bills happen to show up and everywhere I look, there you are. So listen, I was there. Fifteen years ago, I was there. Not like you think, not like it sounds. But the whole shit went down, I was right there. Sonny... I don't know if I can help you. What? I need you to add this to my bill. I'm giving you an hour, and then I gotta go to Getman. So, what do you expect me to do? I need you to at least give me till the morning. - Let me figure something out. - Why am I doing this? All right, I will see you in the morning. - Early. - Thank you, thank you. I got Jake. But, Jake got me. What do I do? Come clean, end up in a prison cell. Find the rest of the cash, bolt out of town. I had to find a way out. A way out that would protect Megan and Darcy. Darcy! - I'm sorry. - It's okay, it's okay. It's okay. Here, get in the house. You comfortable? You have everything you need? I miss this place. Home sweet home. You probably think I'm some irredeemable piece of crap, don't you? Without one single drop of human compassion. No, I'm wrong. Sonny must've really loved you. He sacrificed who he was as a cop and a man to try and stop you. Me? I'd have put a bullet in your head first chance I got. You hate him, Jake? - I love him like a brother. - So all this just to hurt him? Self-help, Detective. I'm trying to get his balls back. You're afraid of me, aren't you, Detective? I am afraid of getting you on my shoe. Ah... All right. Well, I'm gonna finish the rest up tomorrow 'cause I still got let some of this dry. Yeah, I should get going. It's late. Stay. Stay? Are you sure you want me to stay? You remember where the couch is? Yeah? Are you a comedian now, huh? It's good to see you smile. - Good night, baby. - Good night. The armored car. - Huh? - Sonny Carson was there 15 years ago, wasn't he? You keep checking, you got somewhere to be? All right. I'm turning it off. If you can help me out here, I can help Sonny. Clearly, we both care about the guy in our own... twisted way. You and Sonny? Talk to me. Question first. Are you L, G, B, or T? You've been in prison too long, Jake. See, that shit's not funny anymore. I thought Jake was gonna kill me. I'm so sorry I got you into this, Darcy. Well, what's wrong with him? Is he crazy? You and Meg, you're the best thing I ever had. Jake never had that. He doesn't have much love in him. He wasn't always like that though. What's gonna happen to you? I'm gonna be all right. Don't you worry about me, okay? Oh. Just remember that Megan and I are always here for you. - Sonny? - Jake escaped. Now, come on. Yeah, yeah. You know what's ironic, Lorna? Huh? You are on my shoe. Sonny? - Where are you going? - To find my brother. One for you... one for you... and one for me. Blaine! - Fuck! - Jake. Jake Banning. - I don't know. - Where is Jake? You're a fucking liar. Give me that. What are you doing? - I don't know. - Jake Banning. - I don't know. - You don't know? High end military shit, Blaine. Assault rifles, grenades. That's all you, baby. That's your shit. You're a dead man. Oh, two shots, let's try three. Stop! You're gonna kill him. You feel fucking good, don't you? What you got here? You got fucking dick pills. You can't get your dick up on these fucking hoes here? This will help, open up. Your fucking heart's gonna explode, nigga. You better give it up. Stop! Don't die, don't die. Hold on, hold on. Eat them up, use your words. - Use your words. - I don't know. I don't know. Use your fucking words. Tell me. - I don't know. - Where the fuck is Jake? Where the fuck is Jake? Just tell him where Jake is. - Jake's brothers... - Just... Just tell him! They're at... - Let him go. - They're at the fucking Rat. You better not be fucking with me. He's gonna need an ambulance. ♪ One time For the one time ♪ ♪ Yeah, yeah ♪ They love us in the hood Yeah, yeah live the lit life ♪ ♪ Hustle all day And we party all night ♪ ♪ Step to a boss and I put that On the gang sign ♪ ♪ Yeah, yeah, boy Keep it lit ♪ ♪ Yeah, yeah, boy We keep it lit, keep it lit ♪ ♪ Yeah, yeah, boy We keep it lit ♪ ♪ Yeah, yeah, boy We keep it lit ♪ ♪ Keep it lit We gonna keep it lit ♪ ♪ Patron, what do you say We'll never admit ♪ ♪ Baddies in my section I'll be steady flexin' ♪ ♪ Honeys, they're sayin' I'm lookin' like a blessin' ♪ Hi. ♪ You ain't for Style like this ♪ ♪ We them love songs All the girls love us ♪ ♪ Flyest in the room Nobody above us ♪ ♪ I make them boss moves I got puddy cat ♪ ♪ Hit the club Turnt up like it's my birthday ♪ ♪ I go zero to 100 ♪ Wrack up, make it count Pick a honey ♪ ♪ Every time I come through It be lit ♪ ♪ Scene like a flick Then I lean with your chick ♪ ♪ They love us in the hood Yeah, yeah live the lit life ♪ ♪ Hustle all day And we party all night ♪ ♪ Step to a boss and I put that On the gang sign ♪ Not on the list, right?

Is that not the finest ass you've ever seen? I mean, it's better than Megan's little speed bump, right? Hey. How many years do you think this is all worth? Snorting pure Columbian, all for fun, till she likes that, huh? Maybe like two, three years. Maybe. Somehow it just doesn't seem to add up. I don't know why. Give me a light, baby. I mean, brother Kayvon, maybe he's worth two, three years. Maybe. Joe? Joe wasn't worth shit from jump, if you ask me. So, uh, never mind. I give him a year because I'm feeling charitable. But all this shit here? Maybe five or six years. - You're losing me, Jake. - Yeah, me too, Jake. I'm talking about my life, you fucking dodo head! Fifteen fucking years. You go and try make them years up. It's not easy. I've tried it. I've got my hands full. I've done fucked and killed everything I can get my little itty bitty fucking hands on. It's just doesn't seem to add up. I'm not being given my due. All this shit here is just... boring. It's all been done before. It's really depressing me. It's been a depressing day. And then there's you, Sonny. You remind me... My brother, you keep me going. And that pretty little whore right there, she told me the greatest story I've ever heard. That shit you did to that pimp, that's the type of shit that keeps me warm and fuzzy at night. You tortured that boy just to get to me. I love it. - I love it. - Hey, Kelly, - go, get out of here. Kelly, go! - Kelly, stay. Stick around. Hey. You recognize it, huh? It belong to uh... Whoever the fuck... What was her name? Lori? Donny? What's her name, Sonny? - Lorna. - Lorna. - Yeah, Jake, her name is Lorna. - She's right there, say hello. She on my shoe. One in the chamber, partner. Go ahead, finish me. I know you got an end game. You ain't come up in this butcher shop like a dumb little lamb chop now, did you? I'm not gonna shoot you, Jake. I'm not gonna shoot you, you know why? 'Cause that's what you want. And look here, brother. Demon. 24/7, life in prison. Twenty-three and one. You don't count days, you count push-ups, right boy? That's what I call hell. Hey! Ain't nobody shoot homie but me. What, Sonny? We boring you? Nah Jake... ...I thought you knew me. You got a plan now, huh? Nah... just winging it. You kiddin' me? That supposed to hurt? What do you know about pain? Huh? Hey, look me in my eyes. It's like looking in a mirror, huh? How about one last drink? Huh? One more. Ah. Shit. Sonny. Demons always use your secrets against you. Those dark corners where you keep all the hurt and pain. They summon you. That's why I knew where Jake wanted me to find him. The place where his pain was rooted. Place he's been stuck for the last 15 years. - Yeah, it figures. - Where else is there? When I was in prison, I owned you, Sonny. When I got out... guess I don't want to give you up. Jake, listen to me and I really want you to hear what I'm saying. Okay, Sonny, I'm really listening. I didn't take your life. You made your own decision, lost your own 15 years I don't owe you shit. Why would I do that to myself? 'Cause you rotten. Some would say I'm a product of my environment. No, I used to say that to myself too. It's not true. Something's been fucked up inside of you for a long time. You feelin' that? It's the fucking rush, man. It's the uncertainty. It fucking kills me. That ain't gonna be what kill you, Jake. Oh, yeah? What's gonna fucking kill me? You should've went to South America. Oh, I see it now. Sonny, I feel it now. Oh, it's beautiful. It's fucking poetic, man. I know now. I know now, you know, you got it back. Do you? Do you, Sonny? Come on, look me in my eyes. I wanna see it. I know you're dying to pull that trigger. Here we go. Hey, how does it feel to be me? Huh? Do it. If you don't do this, I'll be back. I'll just get out. I'll find Megan. I'll find little Darcy. I'll find everybody you pretended to love and care about, I'll take 'em away from you, boy. I'll take your life away from you piece by piece. Get on your fucking knees. Get on your fucking knees, Jake. Here we go. How did it go, Sonny? One would say, "We're going straight to hell." What the other one say? How'd it go, Sonny? Tell me. Sonny, how'd it go? Sorry, brother. You can go to hell all by yourself. It doesn't end like this. Sonny! See? You and me... like lookin' in the goddamn mirror. You're like me, brother. Welcome back, Demon. I never left, brother. Bring Sonny Carson in. You see, we all have demons inside of us. The difference between me and Jake... ...he needed to feed his. I had to kill mine. But destroying your demons won't always set you free. Only the truth can do that. Did I want to keep the money? Sure I did. But I'm on my own road now, with the people I love.
