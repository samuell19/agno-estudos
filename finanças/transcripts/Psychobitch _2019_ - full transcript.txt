Damn it! Shit! Son of a bitch! Mom? Hey. Have you seen my English paper? It's right over there. - My fault. - Dad's the thief. Sorry, buddy. I couldn't help myself. I had to take a peek. It's really good. Your English is... You write like an adult. A pro. I know lots of English, too. When you're as old as Marius, your English will be great, too. - Why is she on the roof? - She just wants attention. What's going on? Frida is up on the roof. Look. What's so fun up there? Doesn't she have anything better to do? I heard she sees a shrink. - She tried to kill herself. - Really? - No way! - It's true. She couldn't even get that right. That's not funny! I was just kidding. I feel sorry for her. Why bring Cecilie out there? What can she do? They're cousins. Maybe that's why. OK, today we're going to start thinking about your future. You start high school next year. Many of you have already thought about that. You need to start deciding what kind of high school you might be interested in. And what the admission requirements... - Frida, where are you going? - Out. We're in the middle of a lesson. But I'm not going to school next year. Of course you are. No, I'm going to travel. Hang on. Frida! What the hell was that? OK! OK, listen up. Back to the matter at hand. I have some brochures that you should read... PSYCHOBITCH - Who are you going to the dance with? - Adrian. - And you? - Elias. - Who are you going with? - Trym. OK, thanks. Marius? Are you going with Lea? Lea hasn't decided between Kjetil and Marius. Really? Didn't you just rehearse together? Yeah, but I rehearsed with Kjetil last time, so... - Can you make a decision soon? - Sure, I'll figure it out. We need to know, so we can plan... Relax! She said she'd let you know. I am relaxed. It's just hard to plan a dance. It's hard to choose, too. What if she rushes it, and makes the wrong choice? Just let me know, OK? Yes, just a second. Damn it! Hi. - Yes? - What if my homework is done? There are extra exercises at the bottom of the page. You can do those after the mandatory ones. - Yes, Marius? - I have a suggestion. OK? Since this is such an important time for us, with final grades and all, maybe we should have study groups. I know tenth grade did last year. We could team up two and two, and help each other prepare for tests. That sounds like a good suggestion. You get what I mean, right? Marius? Do you have a second? I'm glad you had time for a quick chat. You mentioned study groups earlier. That was a super suggestion. I'm not sure how we'd do it, but I was thinking... One thing I'd like to ask you about... And the reason I want to ask you specifically is that you, without a doubt, are a resource in your class. - I don't know about that. - Well, you are. That's a fact. So what I want to ask you, is if you could team up with Frida. - Yeah. - Yeah? But... Last year's tenth graders got to choose their own study groups. I'm aware of that. But the reason I am asking you, is that Frida is relatively new in class. And she has struggled at school and privately. So I thought a group with you two would be good for her. Yeah. OK? Excellent, Marius. Keep up the pace, boys! Come on, Trym! Keep it up. Isn't ice cream in winter wrong? Ice cream is never wrong. Period. Is there anything better? Than ice cream? I don't think so. Maybe sex. What would you know? You haven't screwed either. I'm going to screw before you. You think so? - I doubt it. Sorry. - I think so. - Not if you end up with Lea. - What do you mean? Because she has said she wants to wait. Too bad for you. She's waiting for me. - I think she's waiting for Kjetil. - Kjetil? You just wait and see. Yo, guys. - Call me when that happens. - I will: "Hey, Trym ..." Hello! Guys, listen up. What is it? Think about me. I'll never get to screw. - What do you mean? - Because ... - You know I'm Muslim, right? - Yeah. The thing is, we don't screw. But we make love! Make love! - Bullshit! - No, it isn't. You're full of crap. I am not. Ask anyone. - Whatever. - It's better. Huh? You, over there eating a hamburger. Isn't it better to make love than to screw? - Let's get out of here. - Are you running away? - You're embarrassing me. - What do you mean? No, you don't. We're a group. You and I are a group! This is a school. People are trying to work and concentrate. Keep your voice down. Could you open the door? Why? Because I want to come in. Fine. I'll just leave. Yeah. Jesus! Are you getting mad? Yeah, maybe a little. Look! I didn't know that. Wow. What? That you like dicks. Have I done something to you? You're only in a group with me because they asked you to. No. What's so funny? It cracks me up when people lie. Come on. I'll let you in if you admit that you lied. Fine. I lied. I wouldn't be here if I hadn't been asked to. Entrez! I'm actually relieved. Because if you can lie, you're not a total bore. You don't know everything about me. I think you're pretty much a good boy. Someone who does what he's supposed to do. You shouldn't be so glib. Glib? Isn't that a word they used back in the 1950s? Then people might want to hang out with you. You think you know everything about me. No. Then tell me something. Tell me about the crazy things you do. I'm not going to just list everything. - You understand that. - Sure. Because it would be a crazy long list. Jesus... If you can't say it all, maybe you can show me? Show you what? Salami! Yum. That, for example. Ow! Fuck! Sorry. Fine, go ahead and hit me. Get it over with. Hey, do you have a charger? Sure. In my backpack. Bottom pocket. Thanks. Seriously, that didn't just happen. That didn't happen. What are you doing? What's it look like? - We're supposed to study. - I don't want to. Just don't tell anyone about that. I can say whatever I want. No, I'm serious. You're serious? Move! I hope you understand. - Who the hell do you think you are? - I mean it. - Let me out! - Stop it! - Fuck off! - Calm down! Damn psychobitch! Get out of my way! Marius just wanted to help Frida and be nice to her. But that clearly isn't safe. She just snapped. - She attacked him. - She lost it. She hit him in the face with her backpack. What could he do? She went like this. And just... - Right in his face. - It wasn't like that. -Yes, it was. -No, it was worse. She picked up her backpack and... Right in his face. What is her problem? Now what? You never know what she's going to do. Move closer together. Are you ready? Straighten up. - Everyone say "Ice Age"! - Ice Age! - Who posted that? - I don't know. We just saw it. - You must know. - Lots of people have shared it. Seriously? That's not nice to Frida. It's supposed to be funny. It wasn't meant to be mean. Everyone else has seen it. Seriously, who posted it? We don't know. Who shared it? Lots of people. She has problems. She tried to kill herself. You have reached number... Marius, it's your turn. OK. Maybe you could try facing the other way? There. And look in that direction. Straighten your back. And... The memory chip is full. Sorry. There. Now I'm ready. - Ready? - Yes. Straighten up. That's good. And smile. Big smile. That's better. Now show some teeth. Hello? Is anyone there? Shit! Sorry! - Sorry! - Shit! Frida, I didn't mean to do that. What the hell are you doing? - I rang the doorbell. - And then waltzed right in? I was worried you'd tried to kill yourself. I was taking a bath. Yeah. I guess I'll just leave. I have to get my shoes. Over by the porch. Drinking on a Tuesday. We'd better be careful. - There's Marius! - Hi, Marius. Speak of the devil. Come say hi. We're making sushi. Join us. No, I think I'll eat later. You go ahead. Have you hurt yourself? What's that? I slipped on the ice over by the bus stop. It's no big deal. It didn't hurt at all. Pål's been bragging about your English skills. But maybe they got knocked out of your head? No, I think most of it's still there. "So you still understand us?" "Yes, I understand you perfectly." That's nothing. You should hear his vocabulary. What was that word I forgot, that you knew? - Chandelier? - Yes. "Chandelier." OK, how do you say tumble dryer? I could use that now. Do you know what it is? Yeah. "Tumble dryer." Excellent! OK... - Agriculture. - Coming from our farmer! - Come on. - Do you know that one? "Agriculture." Impressive! Persuade. "Persuade." I have one. Scaffolding. "Scaffolding." Stock broker? "Stock broker." Bunk bed? "Bunk bed." On a résumé we also have "other relevant experience." There you can write things you have done or experienced, in addition to everything else. Yes, Frida? If I experience that someone breaks into my house and comes into the bathroom while I'm naked in the tub... Can I write that? No, that would be something else. What they are interested in here, is work experience. I think we have covered all the essentials. What is your problem? - What do you mean? - I'm not some Peeping Tom! - OK... - Exactly. So stop it! Fine. - Yeah. - Yes. But I was wondering... What did you think? Huh? I mean, you saw me naked. So I just wondered... if you thought I looked good. Or not. Good? I don't know. What little I saw was, I guess... I don't know. I didn't get a close look. Can we please stop this now? Fine. I mean, you're the one who breaks into houses, but... Fine. I'm sorry, OK? Sorry for... Everything. Can we just call it quits now? Seriously. Sure. Good. But I do have to see you naked. Huh? You saw me naked, so I have to see you naked. No way. Not a chance. Everything off? That's the definition of naked. Come on. Fine. This one? Turn it off. Fine. What were you planning on doing? If you had found me dead in the tub. I don't know. I hoped to get there in time. I won't be naked for long. You don't have to go through with it. What kind of a jerk do you think I am? I don't think you're a jerk. That's nice. Who do you think would win if you and I got in a fight? Um... You? No holds barred. You're furious. And it's a fight to the death. Which one of us would survive? Both of us, I hope. Both of us? Are you sure? I don't know. Are you sure? Huh? Ow! Come on. Let's see how strong you are. Are you getting violent, or what? I don't get it. What's up with you? I'm a little restless. I haven't worked out today. That's all. Should we keep working? OK. Are you about ready? - Yeah. - Good. Shit! Can you see if I remove a like? What happens when you hit the like button? Instagram is merciless Marius, I'll go get the car. OK. Frida Valstein: Are you stalking me? No, sorry. I accidentally hit the button and... Or do you want to finish stripping? No thanks. Damn it! So you're just enjoying that picture of my lovely booger? Yes, I love boogers. Yes, I like boogers. Yes, nice booger. Are you coming? Yeah. Swimming = boogers! Cross country = mucus!! Do you ski cross country? Yes. I'm actually on my way to practice now. Ski naked! Then you can strip and practice at the same time!:) Does a condom suit qualify? Don't lose them, Marius! Bye. Are you looking for me? No. OK. It seemed more like you were looking for me. I had to see what you looked like in that condom suit. - What did you think? - It looked tight. Are you just going to stand there? - It sure is high. - Yeah. Holy shit! You can't do that! It isn't very tempting to jump in there. You never regret going for a swim. Are you up for a swimming race? What do you mean? Are you ready? One. Two. Three! - Yes! - Damn it… Congratulations. Shit! You let me win. Yeah. - Otherwise I would have crushed you. - Let's do it again. OK. But this time, under water. - All the way across? - At least halfway. OK, so you're changing the rules to win? - Yeah, is that a problem? - Not at all. Good. - Are we starting under water? - Of course. I'll count to three. OK. Hello? Can you move to the side? We're starting practice here. - There you are. - Yes. Hey... Could you get him to play for us? - Why? - We need some halftime music. Hi there. Would you mind doing us a little favor? Could you play for us? No, I have to leave now. - Just one song? - No, I can't. Fine. What the hell? Is that the best you can do? - Hi there. - Hi. I'll give you 10 kroner to play. I'll do it for 100. - I'll give you 20. - No. 100. That's my going rate. I'm pretty good. You're pretty good? I got paid 2000 to play once. - Wow! - Yeah. How much is your hat worth? 100? Give me that! - You'll get it back if you play. - Frida... - Come on. - Come on! - Give me my hat. - Give it to him. Don't you want to hear him play? Yes, but... What the hell? Do you have to be a jerk? Do you have to be nice? He's ten years old. Give me that hat! - Give it to me! - Let go! - Stop it! - You're ruining it! - You're the one who took it. - Let go! Stop it! Let go! Are you really traveling next year? Maybe. I thought about it when you mentioned it. How about here? THE SUBURB OF GRORUD Yeah. No, here. Hello! India. They have holy cows there. You like cows, so that's a good fit. - Is there something wrong with that? - No. No. Cows put you in a good "mooood." That was really bad. But I made you laugh. Nah. I see you're smiling. - No, I'm not. - You're not? You almost lost your bad-ass image there. Be careful. Hello? Jesus... Come on! Come on! I give up. Can I... ask you something? Sure. Why... did you try to kill yourself? I don't really know, so... No? Everyone wants to know the reason. "How and why did you do it?" "Who beat you as a kid?" There isn't just one reason. I understand. Sometimes... I wish there was only one reason. That would make it so much easier. To just be able to say: "My uncle drinks and beats me." But basically, it's just really messy. Most of all... I started thinking that I was no good. A failure, compared to everyone else. I don't think you're a failure. I mean, you swam faster than me. Jerk! But seriously, I don't think you're a failure at all. You're different, but in a good way. You're... Cool. "Cooool." - Like a cow? - Yeah. Let me show you a video. OK. Show you how cool cows are. Look at this. - Good dance moves, huh? - Yeah. A little offbeat, but otherwise not bad. Hey, have you ever tried that? - What? - Dancing to a different beat. No, I don't think so. OK, first we dance to this one. We keep that beat, and then after a while I'll switch songs. But we have to keep the same beat. So we want to keep the beat to this song? Come on! OK? And now I'll switch. Shit! I lost it completely. Let's try again. This time I'm going to do it. Now switch. Hang on. I have to think about the other song. OK, just think about the other one. Yes! - Yes! - Now we've got it! Are we like those cows now? Hello? Is anyone there? Hello? Damn it! It's locked. Don't do that! That was the security guard. So what's your plan? To jump down? There must be some other way down. It's open! - You need help? - No, I'm fine. Shit! Let's get out here! Hey! Is he there? What are you doing? Don't move. Stop! Wait! Come back! How did you get into the school? - The door was open. - It was? What's your name? Eh... Martin. Martin? Do you have ID, "Martin"? - No. - No ID? Your name isn't Martin. Come on! Holy shit! Wow. That is the most insane thing I have ever done. But, wait... I live that way. So... Yeah? I live that way. Yeah. But... I'll talk to you later. Yeah. Moo! Moo! Moo! Moo! Sorry. I'll just put this right here. There. - Are you in bed already? - Yeah. I was a little tired. You aren't sick, are you? - No. - You look warm. I feel fine. My god, you're all sweaty! - I'm fine. - Is the window open? - No, it's been closed. - There's a serious draft here. Pål, can you come up here? - I'll just have him look at it. - Now? Feel around the windows here. It's freezing. Right where he sleeps. Are you sick? No, not really. - This isn't bad. - It feels so cold. - Maybe right here. - That's where it is. What are you guys doing? - It was so cold in here. - Are you cold? We have to do something about... Hello! Boo! Shit! - Sorry. - It's OK. Well, say it! OK... The thing is... I'd like to go to the school dance with you. Yeah? That's great. Are you happy? - Yes, very. - Excellent. We can't have incidents like this at this school. Violence and vandalism are unacceptable. So if you have seen anything, talk to me or the vice principal. Anyway, enough about that. Back to your studies. It's 1 p.m. You can leave. Want to run away to India with me? Home alone. Plan our India trip? I just... don't feel very well. Oh. Do you feel sick? I don't know. Maybe it was the pizza. I just feel... Kind of nauseous. That sucks. Yeah, it does. - But you'll be OK? - Sure. I just feel really queasy. I should probably... just head home. Sure. I'm on my way. Marius? You can't walk home alone if you feel sick. I can walk with you. Really? You don't have to. But I want to. OK. But... Don't you live over there? Yes. Of course. - I'm totally messed up. - That sucks. Hopefully you'll feel better soon. Yeah, I'll just go straight to bed. Hello! This is our last rehearsal before the dance. We'll follow the same pattern... What happened to you? You never came? We'll start over here and walk down the floor to there. Family and friends will take pictures there, so remember to smile. We can go to that Grorud suburb instead, if you want. The couples will split up at the end, and then we'll circle back around. And then we'll go eat... We can't hang out anymore. But you know all this. We've said it so many times. You must know it by now. We're very excited and hope you are, too. Are we allowed to wear shoes in the gym? We asked the principal. I don't think we'll be allowed to, because of the floor. It's unfair to Lea. Hello. We're starting now. OK, have fun. This is the last rehearsal before the dance. There's a good chance I'll skip your amazing dance. It's mandatory. If you skip it, they'll write you up. They'll write me up? Shit! Fuck! Thanks for letting me know. I didn't realize the school dance was so official. - I told you I wanted almond brittle! - It's too late. - But I'm telling you now! - You've eaten almost everything. Jesus! There's a difference between almond brittle and fucking almonds! Are you still sick, or what? No, relax. I'm fine. Hello? I got the wrong topping, OK? He's just pissed because he can't screw Lea. Bye. Hey... I can tell something's bothering you. It's just that... You're going to think I'm weird. Never. Come on. Tell me. The thing is... I have trouble sleeping. I'm stressed about everything. School. Ski practice. The store closes in ten minutes. Come on. - Come on! - We're coming. Hey, are you sure it isn't something else? Yeah. I... think you're so hot. So are you. Marius, the others are here! - I have to get changed. - I'll go down in the meantime. - That one's nice. - Look at Catrine! Karsten and Grete's daughter. She looks just like them. The class pictures are here. You probably want to see Lea's picture. Not that one... There! That sure is a gorgeous date you have. That's a great picture, Lea. Where were we? Here's Catrine. Why are you facing that way? I had to face that way because of the bruise on my cheek. - At least you stand out. - Definitely. But is that a good thing? You're the only one facing that way. Did she even apologize? - Yes. - What do you mean? Did Frida apologize? Apologize for what? For hitting Marius. Was that bruise from Frida hitting you? Yeah, it was totally crazy. It wasn't the end of the world. - There were consequences. - Consequences? You had to sit the other way and hide half your face. Jesus! What? It doesn't matter which way I'm facing, does it? - No one will ever notice. - I noticed it right now. What, are you going to buy all those portraits and hang them up? No. I didn't think so. Let's go. What's going on? I can tell something's wrong. He just left. Why? I don't know. He isn't usually this mad. What's with him? You know what the problem is, right? Marius, it's Lea. - Yeah? - Can you open the door? Yeah. Just give me a second. We can do it. If... You want. What? We don't have to. I want to. I really do. I just want you to be happy. But... Trym is about to play. Can't we just wait? Do it later? Hi! I've got waffle mix and cooking spray. Lea! Lea, wait! What's going on? Trym, Trym! You were really good. I'm serious. How long have you played? - Ten years. - Ten years? - I've taken lessons. - What's the difference? Why don't you want to have sex with Lea? Why don't you want to have sex with Lea? Do you hear what you're saying? Lea thinks you don't like her anymore. What the hell? Do you? Yes, of course. What do you expect, when you reject her like that? Why didn't you want to screw her? Trym was about to play. "Trym was about to play"? Is he the one you want to screw? - Hello! - It was in the bathroom. - So? - Yeah. What's the problem? Is it wrong of me to think it's weird to screw in the bathroom here? Is that the only reason? Yes. Of course. Lea was the one who wanted to wait. Not anymore. OK. That's good. Yeah. I have a free house, so... I changed the sheets. Everything is clean. Let's see. There's music here, if you need it. Hello! - Do you need any help? - Give me a break. Get out! OK. Jeez. Isn't this a little... Weird? It's fine for me. If you want to. Sure. Cool. Have fun. No problem. Hello! Hi. I smell waffles. - Before dinner? - Don't blame me. It was Cecilie's idea. Sorry. - Hungry? - Stop! Are you OK? Sure. - It doesn't hurt? - No. It's fine. We can't hear anything! I don't think they're doing it. - That's private! - We can't hear anything. I don't think they're doing it. Leave them alone! That's private. - They're screwing! - Come on, Trym. Our boy has grown up! Lea, details. Right now. What happened? - It was fine. - Was he good? It sounded better than just "fine." Did Marius give you an orgasm? Someone in there had an orgasm. What the hell? Did that hurt? What's your problem? She just pushed me. Did she hurt you? A little bit, but no problem. - You didn't get scared? - Not at all. I mostly feel sorry for her. I can understand that. Who do you feel sorry for? There was this girl at school who pushed me a little. Why do you feel sorry for her, if she pushed you? Because she's a little sick in the head, so... That makes sense, then. Yes, he's right here. What? Vandalism? This doesn't sound like the Marius I know at all. But the security guard recognized his picture. Do you have anything to say? What is there to say? Say what you told me. Fine, I can say it. Do you want me to? The thing is... It was... Frida. She has some mental issues. She's the one who did it. And dragged Marius into it. Right? Is that true? Because we know there was a girl involved as well. You have to answer. I'm nodding. Yes, it was Frida. OK? OK. Good. So it took a little doing, but I think we saved your grades, at least. We'll just hope the rest works out over time. I must say I'm very impressed with how you've handled this, Marius. You regret your actions. Not everyone would be able to take responsibility like that. Jesus, Dad! - I ratted someone out. - No, you didn't. Yes, I did. So maybe praise isn't exactly in order. Was that praise? - You brag about everything I do. - No, I don't. Yes, you do. - It's pretty sick. - Marius! It isn't good to get praise all the time. No, I understand that. Do you? That's great. You're right. It isn't good to get praise all the time. I didn't see it like that. I'm glad you pointed that out. That's very mature of you. You're bragging again! Can't you hear yourself? I just meant you saw something that I didn't see. I didn't mean... Incredible! Kristoffer? - Can I go to the bathroom? - Yes. Hi. Don't touch me! Can we just talk for a second? Sure. What did you want to say? The thing is... That you ratted me out and that you're chicken and... Well, I already know that, so... It's so easy for you. And clearly really hard for you. Yeah. Maybe so. But I'm not like you. I can't just run around being... What? Psycho? Or? Yeah. It seems like that's what you want to be. "Want to be"? Isn't it? No. No? It's exactly what you want to be, damn it! You want to be that mysterious girl who no one understands. That's bullshit! You want to be the girl everyone feels sorry for, who's angry and weird all the time. You love being different. You love being a fucking psychobitch. I mean, you could try to be normal. See how easy it is. Normal? You mean like you? Yes. - I can't not give a shit, like you. - You can't do it at all! But that's just how you are. You don't even dare talk to me! Hello! - You need to stay away. - You need to shut up. - Forget to take your pill today? - Yeah. Well, get over it. He doesn't like you. That's weird, since he keeps kissing me. Leave now! - Let go of me! - That's enough! You fucking... Calm down. Shit! Go away! Don't! Sure, no problem. Are you sure? I can come home now and work early tomorrow instead. No, it's no problem. Because... Cecilie is here and we've made waffles. That sounds nice. That's good. - Then we solved that. - Yeah. Bye. Can everyone settle down? I'm afraid I have some very sad news. That's why the school nurse is here, too. I may as well just say it. We were informed yesterday that Frida has tried to take her own life. It's important to let you know that she's fine. Fortunately, she did not succeed. But it's very sad to think that Frida has been in such a dark place. So I want us to spend some time today talking about how we're really doing. One thing that actually is positive, is that both Frida and her mother... Marius, you can sit down in one of these chairs. Make some room for him. We've just started talking. Trym, repeat what you said. It was good. I just said that those who dare to talk about how they feel are the bravest. Being able to talk about painful, difficult things can be very healthy. Often, when I feel sad, it gets worse if I don't talk about it. And it feels good to express that here, doesn't it? I went to a psychologist once, and I'd consider doing it again, because it felt pretty good. I also think it's good for boys to be able to talk about emotions. I agree. That's actually very important. I used to not want people to know if I was unhappy. But that's stupid, so I stopped. - If I'm upset now, I just say it. - That's good. Jesus... Is the goal to be as miserable as possible? - No. - It sure seems like it. It's important to communicate with each other about how we feel. You should try. You seem to have issues. Issues? Isn't that good? Let's bring things down a notch. Is it good to be miserable, or is it bad? Everybody here is saying they're miserable because that's the right thing to say. - Get a grip. - Who? Me? You'd say you like to fuck sheep, if you thought that would make you cool. - What's your problem? - My problem? What's yours? Why are you mad every time we talk? I don't get what's going on! What the hell was that? Want me to drive you to practice? Hey... Are you thinking about what happened to Frida? I understand that you are struggling with that. With everything that's happened. You may feel that it was your fault, but it wasn't. - Yes, it was. - No. It's much more complicated than that. There are many reasons why she did what she did. It has nothing to do with you. - It does. - No. She's not well, Marius. I think you should go skiing. Clear your mind. It won't help to ski! I feel guilty, OK? - But you don't have to feel guilty. - I do. Leave me alone. - I'm just trying to help. - I don't want your help! Don't you get it? I don't want any help. Can you leave? But... I just want to lie here and be miserable. - Get out! - I can help you. Get out! What the fuck? Get out! Get the hell out of here! Get out! Shit! Fucking ski uniform ... Son of a bitch! Hi. No, leave. Out! Get out! - Just give me two seconds. - Get out! No! - Get out of here! - Wait. Come here. You have to leave. Wait, damn it! I'm not afraid to call the police. Fine. Do it. Is that what you want? No. But go ahead. She'll do it. - Fine. - I'm not going to stop her. I don't care. When did you become so tough? Marius, can't you just leave? We were in the middle of something. Leave. What? Trying on dresses? Yeah. I didn't think you were going to the dance. I thought you were going to travel. To India, to see the cows. Stop it! Get out of here. Leave! I'm in love with you. No, you're not. - I am. - No. - Yes, I mean it. - No! I'm serious. I don't love you. I'll give you one more chance to leave now. Hello? Do you mean it? Yes. Hey... Mom? Don't go. What's going on? I'm not sure. What's up? Lea feels kind of afraid. Why? Because you've been acting so weird. Is Lea afraid of Marius? It isn't funny. You argued with Trym, but she gets all the questions. "What's going on with Marius?" You think that's fun for her? I apologized to Trym. We've made up. How about apologizing to Lea? You've been a shit. A shit? He was awesome! Is it awesome that Lea doesn't want to go to the dance with him anymore? Let me talk to her. What are you going to say? That you've been "awesome"? No. What the hell? Hello? Lea needs you to get your act together. Yeah. OK. I just wanted to say that I'm sorry for acting like a jerk. Are you ready for this? Welcome to the 2019 school dance! You all look amazing. Family and friends are waiting inside to see how incredible you look. So, like we rehearsed: first, we walk in. Then we go up to the cafeteria for food and more fun. Stop it! Stop. Please! Moo! Moo! Moo! Moo! Moo! Moo! Subtitles: Nick Norris
