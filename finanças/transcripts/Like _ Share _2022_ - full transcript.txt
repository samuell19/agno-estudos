Straighten your head. -Are you done? -Hold still, I'm focusing the camera. I'm rolling. Hi, I'm Lisa. Hi, I'm Sarah. And welcome to our channel. Don't forget to subscribe… comment, like and share. "So hot." "Sexy lips." "Curious about other parts." Were you expecting these kinds of comments? Lisa, engagement is engagement. Look. The data is real, okay? There are many other ASMR channels in this world. They're all the same. We have to establish a clear distinction, okay? Come on, so we can get away from here. Come on, earn our freedom. What's your idea? -Okay, look at my list. -Okay. -Okay, corn dog. -Okay. Corn dog… smeared with butter… sprinkled with cereal… -Okay. -Then we bite it. Let them feel it 'til it hurts. -Bite it off. -Okay, I like that idea. Butter, cereal. What are you watching? Come look. I found this viral video. The title is funny. "Dropped Phone Sex Tape." Like this? Yeah. -Damn it. -Get it right. Straighten it, babe. -Can you do it? -This high? -Wait, wait. -Yeah. The guy's ugly. -Why are you body shaming? -He is, look. His dick looks chafed. She is pretty, though. Cute. But her titties are saggy. Why are you so mean, Sarah? If they don't want any comments, why record it? I guess gravity is an enemy for us females. Would you prefer living in a world with gravity… but have saggy breasts? Or we float, but our tits… -Crossed? -Yes, or like… car wipers. If a bra is used for supporting the boobs… If there's no gravity, then they'll be used for… Straightening! You're insane. Wait, wait. Who's calling? Lisa's mom. She said, "Why isn't Lisa answering her phone?" She says, "Emi's not coming to work." You have to take her shift. -I don't want to. -Go home, Lis. -Look, look. -I wanna stay here. -We're almost out of stock, Ma'am. -Okay, we have to buy some. Why didn't you answer your phone? Don't let it happen again. I don't want… FORGOT TO BE HAPPY. Happy birthday to you Right, this one. Ms. Lisa, please help. There's a foreigner. DROPPED PHONE SEX TAPE PART 1 Lisa? Lisa? Why did you lock the door? Have you done your prayers? -Not yet. -Do your night prayer now. Ablute yourself, and wear something decent. Lisa? Okay, okay. Hurry up. ABLUTION PRAYERS -Finish those. -Yes, one at a time. What are you doing?! Give it to me! I wasn't doing anything, I was just straightening my pants! -Lies! Let me see. Let it go. -I really didn't do anything! -Lisa. Let it go. -No. Trust me, trust me, trust me! Let it go. Let me see! What is this? Dear Allah, have mercy. Ninda! Scratch my back with a coin. Fuck! Shit! Do you even love your mother? I was just curious, I just wanted to know. Lucky it was me who saw it. What if it was your step dad? If you were his real daughter, there would be an exorcism! Luckily, I'm my real dad's daughter. Always talking back. Eat your egg. Lisa… For me… this family is my second chance. Your step dad promised, to pay for your college until you get your Master's degree. He'll even let you continue his business. We just want you to be an obedient girl. A pious girl. Obedient. Isn't that easy? I want the two of us to live a peaceful life. Can we? I'm talking to you. LIS, WE GOT 20K VIEWS!! Can you change the wallpaper with our picture? So you'll remember me, before doing any weird stuff. Don't bring me shame. That's okay, if you have none. Change it with the word "Allah." Just so you know. Allah is always watching over you. Can't you find some other friends than Sarah? Making silly videos about food and stuff. Watching ASMR videos calms me down, Mom. If you want to feel at peace, recite the Quran and pray. I don't know how to read Arabic. Here, listen to this. -Today we will discuss… -Send it to Sarah as well. -the hideous effect of pornography. -Maybe she'll repent. Is there anything in the scripture… that justifies the act of masturbation for women? Have you combed your hair? It's messy. My name is Ino. Number 14, and this is my swimming video. Hey, wrong stroke. What kind of stroke is that? Alma, stop the video. -Ino. -Yes, Sir. I'm scoring your butterfly stroke, not your frog stroke. Aren't they both animals, Sir. Better than drowning. Then how should I score you? Just score my effort, Sir. Call it the tadpole stroke. -You, redo your work. -Alright. Next, Alma. Hello, I'm Lisa. Number 12 on the list. How cute… That's how you make a video. See? Sexy, right, Sir? Sir, I didn't know that the whole class would be watching my video. If I had known, I would've… What? Worn something sexier? I mean, something that shows more ass. Hey, can you shut up? -So cringe. -What? Want me to flirt with you too? -Your brain is stuck in your dick! -You wanna see it?! Here it is… Come here! I'm gonna kick your ass! -Pervert dumbass! -What do you want? Shit for brains! Ino! Stop it. You too Sarah. You kids! You're 17 years old already. You all should understand. The school can't organize a group activity. That requires extra funding. You go swimming by yourselves, record it, then I'll score you. Of course you'd defend the pretty girls. Instead of educating the students, they're collectively fooling us. If my mother was still alive, she would've taken me out of here. But that's not the reality. So just accept it and live with it! What's up with you? I miss my old Mom. Every time I see her, it's the same, yet so different. Fine. Moved to Jakarta, married someone new. Converted to Islam. But… Well, you know. You just live with it. What else? I'm sure that's not all. I know you. She caught me watching porn. It's not funny! -Not funny, she's putting me on "trial." -What?! What did she tell you to do? Did she tell you to clean yourself seven times with dirt? Did she? I bet she told you to watch some ustadz on YouTube. I think his name is-- Bitch! I've been thinking about that sermon video. I've been thinking about you. What if we go to hell? Don't you want to see and be reunited with your parents? Do I have an addiction? Lisa… Lisa. Lisa. You forgot your cream puff. My mom always reminds me that there are many ways to look at something. It means, there's nothing wrong with your effort to rid yourself of stress. Right? Okay, come here. Come here. You're normal. Okay? You're a good person. And so am I. Let's just be ourselves. Let's do whatever we want. We explore the world together. Hey? Your parents may judge you and say whatever they like about you, so just let them. As for me, I will always accept you for who you are. Trust me. Seriously. Hi, I'm Sarah. Hi, I'm Lisa. We're about to try some super hot sauce. What are you doing?! -Nice, isn't it? -Yeah. I really like how we sound in this video. Yeah, we will sleep soundly tonight. But do we have to look like this? Lisa, didn't you see how many likes and shares we got? We'll get rich quick, Lisa. Just sell this house if you want to get rich quick. Just marry a foreigner if you want to get rich quick. -How very unfeminist of you. -Screw you. Anyway, my dad is a foreigner. But he's still… broke, you know? But it feels like we're at the beach. In Bali. On a real beach. -Let's have a pet dog. -Having a dog is a hassle. Instead of having a dog… we should find guys. There are no cute guys in Jakarta. None of them are horny for you. You bitch! Wait, wait. Who's calling? Lisa's mom. Yes, Aunty? No need to answer. She's half naked, yes. It's true, Ma'am. On our way here. Thanks to Echa, who forgot her driving license. I thought she had it. So I gave her my license, but we still got the ticket. How was that possible? Do you often switch driving licenses? Yes, but don't tell Father. -Enjoy your drink. -Thanks, Lisa. Greet your sisters. Lisa is so tall right now. And so pretty. Where are you going, Lisa? Come and sit with us. -Sit with us. -It's alright, Sis. I'll stand here. I told Ajeng and Echa. That you plan to go to college in Bali. -Is that right? -That's so far. Are you going to college or having a vacation? Actually I was planning to go with my friend-- She can go to college in Jakarta. It's just a plan. Right? Quick, record it. Here. Look. Via's picture got leaked. Somebody sent me a link. But her gang is in denial. -REPORT AND BLOCK -They said it's not her. Anyway… Why aren't you saying anything? Hello? What's up? What's wrong? May I go to the toilet, Sir. Okay, okay, okay, okay. Okay, okay. I need to go to the toilet as well, Sir. Lisa? The test is about to end. Wash your hands. Why are you asking me about this? Who else should I ask? The school counselor? I'm looking for a solution. Now I know about Lisa's personal matters. What if she comes here? It will be awkward for me to see her. Well, don't look at her. Weirdo. Sis. Did you watch it too? What the fuck?! You actually watched it? Quit acting surprised. I know you watch it too. Shit! But you're a girl! What's with all this noise? Since when is there a rule that limits certain genders from watching porn? So, Sis Mima have never seen them either? See what? Lisa and Sarah watch porn. Sarah said Lisa got addicted. Not necessarily addicted. That's what you told me. Sarah? Sarah. How about you and Lisa do some physical activities? So when you get bored, you'll have something else to do. -Sarah, this place doesn't suit me. -But we only just got here. -Okay? -Watch out. Okay? Hey, what's wrong? It's okay if you still want to stay here. I can go home by myself. It's okay. Where are you going? Back home? Back to your room? To watch porn? Lisa, I read an article the other day. People who are addicted to porn… will lose their brain cells quicker. I'm not addicted. I know what you did in the school's toilet, Lisa. I didn't do anything in the school's toilet. Well, maybe I'm just an idiot. Whatever, I'm going home. Lisa. Lisa. Want me to record you? Sure, okay. Are you sure it's alright? Thank you. Wanna join me? Come on, it's free. My friend just started this club. I don't think so, but thanks. On which days do you exercise? Please, just for today. Accompany me, okay? Are you sure he's legit? Have you searched him on the internet? I don't even know his name. When else can I meet a guy in real life, not just on the internet? You barely know him, and you're in love already? He has a sexy butt. I like it. You're the one who's addicted to porn. Aren't you curious about real life men? You're too noisy. Miss, do you have this in a smaller size? I've looked, but couldn't find it. Alright, Miss. Let me check the storage room. May I see the item? One moment, Miss. We don't have a smaller size. Only this one, but it's too small. Or would you like me to ask another branch? If you're interested, you can ask for it at the cashier. What's that? That was the girl from the sex tape. That's crazy. I'm serious. It's true. Lisa! Lisa, where are you going? What are you going to do? I'm sure it's her. Aren't you curious? No, I'm not. Lisa! See, I'm right. Lisa. Whatever happened, it's her own fault. Okay? We laughed at her misfortune and you won't apologize? How many people's misfortune on the internet have we laughed at? Do you want to apologize to them all? Did you ever think that she just wants to move on from her shame? She cried in the video, Sarah. Huh? The other video. There were two parts. Take that off. Hurry and take it off, Sarah. Hurry up! I really don't know how to help you. I never asked you to. -We have to reheat this first, right? -No need, it's too much trouble. -What for? -Seriously? It won't taste good. Honey, the juice… Susu. So arrogant. Refusing a good meal. She doesn't want it, so don't force her. -Why are you eating it? You're too much. -It's good, so what? Sydney? We're not moving to another town, but a different continent? You can't do this. Making decisions without asking me. I agreed to Bali, not Sydney. Mima got a scholarship offer for her Masters there. You can pick whichever major at that university. This is a privilege, Sar. A huge opportunity. I have my own plan. Here, look at it if you don't believe me. You call this a plan? This is just fooling around. You have no definite goals. No direction for the channel? Lisa and I are still exploring, bro. We're still figuring out the market, the demands, the wants. -If Mother was here-- -Your life is my responsibility, now! Taking care of you, is my obligation. Sarah. Look. You can still do your plans. Just try and do it in Sydney. You're a smart girl. You'll grow your potential better there. Lisa won't be in Sydney. Lisa again. If you can plan things with Mima. Then why are you dismissing my plan with Lisa? -I'm family. -That's right. And I am too. So you should've planned this with me first, before Mima. Mima is my future. Then what am I? Your past? How many left? Three. Let me help you. Come on. Come on, three more. You can do it. -Is my form correct? -It is. Use your core. -Like this? -Yes, tighten it. -Okay. -Okay? One. -Two… -I can't do this. Come on, you can do it. -Hold me. -Last one, you can do it. Three. You're doing great. Sarah. -Let me walk you out. -Okay. Let me carry that. My mother told me not to depend on guys. My mother told me, don't have so much pride. Okay. This one time. I need to be stronger for tomorrow. How about for… tonight? Will you be strong enough? If I want to ask you out? AM I PRETTY? -One more time. -I'm eating here. You think those people in that building can see us? Check. Is that all you've got? Watch this. Which one do you prefer? Asking for help, but nobody helps you, or… people ask you for help, but you can't help them? Why ask that? My parents had an accident… on the tollway. I sometimes wonder. Who saw them that day. Who stopped. Who helped. You have a gross hobby. Weird. Why did you say that? Check the other ones. Let me search it. It's not our hobby. It's our future. There's research about it. Right, Sarah? True. Because the world is getting more sophisticated. People get stressed easily. They say watching ASMR videos can slow your heart rate. Making you more calm, relaxed, and not stressed. Do you still need those ASMR videos, now that you have me? Sarah and I can sleep soundly after watching ASMR videos. I need to watch something else to sleep soundly. Waiter. Here, try this water spinach stir fry. It's the best here. Lisa said they use butter to cook it. Really? What's wrong? I'm fine, it's just super spicy. Just order another one. No need, I'm fine. It's usually not this spicy. If you don't want something, and you don't like it. You have to say so. Devan, I'm fine, seriously. No need to replace it. Okay? -Lisa. -Devan. Stop it, please. Too spicy for her. Please replace it. Usually, you like it spicy. Thank you. It's hot in here. You want to buy some shrimp? There. I'll buy them from the usual seller. Oh, that guy? -Here, some mackerel? -Mackerel, Sir. Right, right. 125. -Do we still have some in stock? -Is that the usual price? We usually get a lower price. We're regular customers here. -Alright, we'll come back here later. -We'll come back later. How about 100? I'll come by later. -Okay. -Keep them for me. Mr. Ambon. -How many kilograms? -Just wrap them. -Okay. -Keep them for me. Lisa! You don't have to make it perfect. The important thing is… steady… and firm. Would you like to join the class, Miss? Keep in mind. Not too little, not too much. To make the dough smooth and elastic. Good job. Okay. You're doing great, Ma'am. Keep going. It's ready. That's enough. Okay. Next. Isn't it magical? Water, mixed with flour, can change into a living thing. That we have to feed. Could bacteria die? This is a natural yeast fermentation. So the good bacteria will fight the bad. They might be okay for a few days. But the next day, the fermentation may stop. That's why many bakers talk with their yeast. Like talking to a friend. They pay attention to their yeast. Care for them. So they won't sulk. So what is your friend's name? A memento. Praise be to Allah, that it is alive still. Give it a name. My dad. Good night, Dad. Mom? Mom? -Mom. -What? Why did you wash it? What was that? It smells. Natural yeast bread. If you want bread, just buy one. It's more practical. I want to make my own sourdough bread, Mom. For school assignment? I'm just curious and I like it, I want to make one myself. You don't even have a good grade in chemistry. Just study, will you? How come you never discuss anything with me? Dear Allah, have mercy. What's going on here? Can you please behave? This is a living creature. Good bacteria. It can be nurtured and fed. All living things can be nurtured with love. You don't throw it away! But it smells! It smells for you, but not for me! You shouldn't have taken it without asking! Ask me first! -Lisa. -Be civil while talking. Linda. With that child, you need to be more… Alright. I will educate her to be more polite. Okay. I've talked with Mima. We're getting married. But, I'll wait for you here. Until you graduate. You can go to college wherever you like. Bali or Sydney. It's your choice. I won't interfere. One thing is for sure. I can't stay in this house much longer. We have to move on. I have to go with Mima to pick some fabric. We'll continue this later. Sarah? I thought you turned off the phone. Are you alright? I miss my mother. Usually when I'm sad, she'd hug me. I wish I could hug you right now. Do you think they can see us? Which one? Those people on the street. I can see you. Is it me or the movie that's boring you? Let me close this. Please put it over there. Thanks. Hey. Don't be embarrassed. I need to pee. Don't look. Hello, Sir? Yes? Oh right, Sir. I've already sent it. Let me check it again. Okay, I'm registering it. Which one? Okay. No, Sir. I'm not busy. Attention to all female students! Go to the school field now. The Kartini Day fashion show is about to begin. Attention to all female students! Go to the school field now. The Kartini Day fashion show is about to begin. Here. Like that. -It's a race. -Who will finish first? Who will finish first? Wow, you're good. -It wasn't that hard. -Is that so? -I'll introduce you to my friends. -Sure. Ah, you're so good. I'm good? I think I'm talented. Let me introduce you to Devan. -Hi. -He is… Lisa. -Lisa. -Take my picture. You want to shoot our ASMR video with those clothes? A new concept? Every time you workout, take a picture of yourself to see your progress. Come on. From below. There. Okay, good. Send them to me. I want to send them to Devan. Devan asked for this? Please. My boy is not a pervert. Then what's this for? Well, aside from measuring my progress, I want to show him my sexy side. Better than him looking at other girls' pictures. He better just look at mine. Send them. Done. Relax, Lis. No face, no case. Okay? Are you sure? He's 27. You're 17. You're still in high school. He's working, a fully adult male. Devan said, maturity is not measured by age. Okay? I'll be 18 soon. You're gonna let him take advantage of you? Calm down, Lis. Relax. Lis, what are you doing? Enough, Lisa! Enough! Give it back! Lis! Why can't you see me happy?! Wait! You need more proof? You're just jealous of my happiness? Why are you being illogical now? Are you jealous because I have a boyfriend? You're jealous of Devan? Or maybe you have the hots for me?! Even if I like girls, I would never like you! WOW. LET ME SEE. SEND ME A PICTURE, SARAH. Sar, my reply was just a reflex. I was working when you sent those pictures. -Mr. Boni, you know how he is, right? -Excuses. Sarah! I wish… that we could have a mature relationship. -I thought you were a grown-up. -I'm just disappointed that you-- You're childish, Sarah. I was wrong. I'm sorry. I'm older, I'm supposed to manage my expectations. No, no. I was supposed to understand that you were working. Sarah. I see so much potential in you. You're not like any other 17 year old girl. 18. I'll be 18 tomorrow. Remember? Of course I remember. And I'll make your 18th birthday unforgettable. Alright? Don't cry. Are we going tomorrow? But I… I don't wanna do anything, alright? I still want to keep… Hey. As if you don't know me. Sarah. If you miss it, take it home. Even jars on a shelf can bump against each other. Let alone friends. Lisa. People will think that you're an employee if you come here too often. And people will think that you're the shop owner. Because you never take a day off. That's true. You don't stay in a boarding house? I used to. But I prefer to stay here, instead of in a boarding house's room. Besides, the owner allows me. Where… Where's your home originally? According to you… What is a home? A home is… a place where… we can be accepted for who we are? In that case… my home… lies within me. -Tastes so good. -Good? Want some more? It's dirty! Here, have some more. Devan, it's dirty! Devan. It's sweet. Devan… Babe… Devan, stop, stop. No, stop. I really want it. No, I don't want it. Devan, stop. Don't you trust me? Come here. Stop it. Stop it. Stop it. Please, it hurts! Just relax. Calm down. Yes, yes. -I want one. -Calm down. This one's for you two. That's better. Alright, alright. -Here. -Give me some. Alright, here. Sir. Someone's trying to harass my friend. -You're so childish. -The guy in green jacket. I'll call you later. -Alright, let's talk somewhere else. -People are looking, Devan. So what? Sarah. Are we still doing the assignment? Let's go, I can't be home late. We'll do it at my house. Sir, this is the guy I told you about. Help me out. Sir, what's wrong? Be honest with me, Sarah. What's up with you and Devan? I've told you, Lisa. I want us to break up. Didn't you celebrate your birthday with him? I saw your Instagram story. What's wrong? Are you alright? I have a stomach cramp. Are you having your period? What's with you? What did Devan do to you? But, I'm okay. Just a little stomach ache. Wasn't it suppose feel good? It's not that simple, Lisa. Isn't it as simple as eating? If you were forced to eat something, the food won't taste good. When you try a new dish… It would taste unfamiliar at first. Then it will get better. Well… Well, maybe… Maybe sex is like that, at first… At first it hurts, but it gets better. But you weren't hurt because you were forced, right, Sarah? Sarah… Perhaps Devan didn't hear me when I said no. What, Lisa? I'm fine! I just hurts a little, that's all. Stop talking about this, okay? But you said no. Are we making content or not? Devan didn't hear you? His eyes were closed, and he covered my mouth, okay? Okay? He covered your mouth? It's not like that. Look, when you watch porn, they have many categories, right? Maybe Devan likes it… If we both closed our eyes. And… And a bit rough. Okay? Were you raped? Lisa… When you watch porn, and they do things like that… does that mean it's a rape? Huh? Think for a bit. You're a victim, Sarah. Enough, Lisa. If you think I'm a victim… then quit watching porn. Don't be a hypocrite. Would you let what happened to you happen to me? No, right? So it's clear that you were raped. I wasn't raped. You said no. He forced you, and now you're in pain. -You're a rape victim. -I wasn't raped, you hear me? If not, then you should feel happy instead of… Lisa, I wasn't raped! Bitch! I can't stop looking at you. You're so beautiful. Come on. Let's get relaxed. So we can sleep soundly. Hi, I'm Lisa. Hi, I'm Sarah. I want to break up with you. -Sar, I love you. -Enough. I want to break up with you. I have all of your pictures. Your videos. No face, no case. Van, Devan. -I'm leaving. Here's your bag. -Okay, take care. Who says there's no face? It's my life, Van. That's why. We should settle this nicely. Alright? So we'll both feel good. Just one more time, please. -Come on! -No. Look this way! I'm leaving. Forgive me, Miss. I watched it. Your video. I… I laughed at you. I fantasized about you. I stalked you. You're not the only one, Lisa, who watched my video. Who fantasized about me. Who stalked me. But you're the only one who's willing to apologize to me. Devan promised me. What did Devan promise you? It doesn't matter what he promised me. I just want this to be over. Sarah! Stop it, Sarah. Tomorrow, everyone will forget. We can tell them that it's not you. HAVE YOU CHECKED THIS LINK? Sarah? Sarah? Huh? Under 18, we can still use the Child Protection Law. The law is well formulated, strict. But, because both are over 18, they are considered adults. Sarah is still in high school. I understand, but-- Sarah got into elementary school at seven. Our parents thought that at that age, she should start to study. I'm not her parent, Sir. I'm her brother, and I didn't know anything! Sir, let's talk about the facts. We have the law, right? Mima and I searched it on the internet. True. But the formal law is not necessarily applicable. No matter how you look at it, this is Indonesia. Systemic problems for years. Sarah could be the one imprisoned, under the charge of a pornographic act. She's been suspended from school already. I leave the decision in your hands. Do you prefer a quick process? Or are you prepared for the long haul? It must be great to be you. Still have time to work out. Still able to laugh. How many times have you watched the video? Did you sleep well? How many hours was it last night? Sarah couldn't sleep, Van. She can't sleep, she won't eat, she can't do anything. She tried to kill herself because of you! You're evil! You should be in jail! Listen. I never leaked that video to anyone. My phone broke. I got it fixed, and my files were gone. You raped Sarah. You recorded it, and you spread it. Don't talk shit, I never raped anyone. You forced her! I know Sarah. Sarah liked it. She asked for it. That's not true. No way is that true. Lisa. Have you ever heard Sarah, when she's having an orgasm? No, right? You just saw the video. You weren't there. Then how did the person who spread it know? That the girl is a high schooler? How did the person who did it know that she's from my school? How did they know just by watching? Listen up. If you try to do something. Her life will get even worse. Remember that. It's always the girl's life that's ruined, not the guy. You got that?! You rapist bastard! If you mess with me, Sarah's life will get even worse. Remember that. It's always the girl's life that's ruined, not the guy. You got that?! We go to the police now. My lawyer already met Devan and his attorney. That bastard admitted no guilt whatsoever. Maybe it was my fault. I'm the fool for falling for him. No, this is not right. -He is an evil person. -My family has gone through enough, Lisa. Who decided this? You? Or your brother? What's the difference? This is your life. My life is over, Lisa. My life is over. Here. I have to move on. We made a promise. We have plans. We can still fight for everything. Nobody would believe me, Lisa. I believe you. But you're not the judge. You have to ask Sarah's permission. Sarah has to agree to it. Miss, everyone has to know. Devan's actions have to be spilled, cancelled! People have to know! He's the one who should be ruined! If he's ruined, then what? What good will it do for Sarah? You don't understand. I understand, Lisa. I used to have a name. Then that name changed… into "Dropped Phone sex tape girl." Then I was just a link that people shared. I don't want Sarah to run away. She's the only one I have! There are many reasons for someone to leave. -No. -I've tried everything, Lisa. I've reported it. But they asked me to get undressed. They had to check if it's actually my body in the video. Dear Allah, have mercy. May peace be upon you. And upon you. Where have you been? Why didn't you tell me? I told you didn't I? Sarah is not a good girl. Sarah is a good person. What kind of a good person… commits adultery and gets the video leaked? What kind of a good woman are you? That has no empathy toward other women. I really don't recognize you anymore. I haven't recognized you for a long time. How can I tell you anything if we don't know each other? Perhaps you forgot that I'm your daughter. And not just a reminder of how you failed. How you chose the wrong person, and that you weren't happy. That you were sick and tired. I never meant it that way! Do you even know? What I've gone through? You think it was easy? It was not easy. It was difficult! Do you know what I've gone through all this time? You think it's easy?! It's hard! All this time, I always tried to accept all of your decisions for me, so you can be happy. So please, just this once, let me choose. I have to be there for Sarah. Sarah's the only one… who always tried to understand me. Sarah's the only one who is always there for me, and accepts me for who I am. I love Sarah. And whatever we've gone through all this time… will never make me stop loving you. I'll always love you. My ex-husband made the video. He said our sex life bored him. He wanted to try to make videos like the ones he liked to watch. But he turned violent. I asked for a divorce. He granted my request. But he leaked all of our videos. Then, weren't you angry? I was once, more than angry. But in the end. It wasn't anger that helped me endure. If you really love Sarah. Listen to her. Because Sarah's the only one that has the right to decide how to endure. And only she can decide how to move forward with her life. Teach me, okay? Aryo! Sarah. You'll always have me. This is a draft of the statement that we composed, and have unanimously agreed upon, yesterday. Mr. Aryo, please check again. Mr. Aryo. I swear that this is all a misunderstanding. I didn't expect this misfortune either. I lost my phone. We both wanted it. Sarah is just a little girl. 18 years old is considered an adult, Sir. Sarah should've calculated the risk when she decided to enter the hotel room with Devan. No problem regarding this evidence? Regret doesn't mean raped. When we first met, Sarah didn't say that she was still in high school. Sarah asked for it. I just lost control. I said no. My sister's future is ruined. What about my future? He forced me. He recorded it. Sarah, we both know! Okay. Okay. Let's all take a deep breath. Let's all calm down. We are all here to find the best way. On how to settle this case immediately. Right? Agreed. We would all like Sarah to move on with her life. Okay, calm down. I LEARNED THIS FROM FITA. LOVE, LISA. I just want my life back. Our lives will never be the same as before. But… That doesn't mean it's ruined. Now I have a place to be myself. A place where I can make mistakes. Where I can learn. Where I can have another chance. PEACE AGREEMENT APIK LEGAL SERVICE I'm sorry, Sarah. I believe in you. It's your life. Your journey. Whatever path you choose… we'll go through it together. Will you forgive me? May peace be upon you, Mom. I'm home. Peace be upon you too. What? Don't cry. -JUST OFFER YOURSELF. -SO THIS IS HOW YOU MAKE MONEY? -YOU THINK YOU'RE PRETTY? -AREN'T YOU AFRAID YOU'LL GO TO HELL? "Should've opened your mouth wider." -DEAR, LISA AND SARAH. ENJOY! FROM SINTA -"I want to unbox Lisa and Sarah." "Gosh, Sarah." "Does it hurt, Baby?" "Can I have the link? DM me." "Waiting for part two of your sex video." "I watched it 'til I came. He, he, he." "Sarah looks pretty when she's crying." "Waiting for your video, Lisa." "I'm sure you can open your mouth wider." "Sarah is cute." "Too bad she's just a leftover." "Her poor future husband." "I feel bad for her future children." "The video went viral." "Please make some more, and more barbaric." "If Lisa takes off her clothes, I'll definitely subscribe." "I used to be curious about how your food tastes." "Now I'm curious about how your body tastes." Remember. It's always the girls' lives that are ruined. Not the men. No. Is it focused, Sar? WE STAND WITH YOU.
