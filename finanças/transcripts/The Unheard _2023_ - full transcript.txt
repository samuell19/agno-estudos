Chloe! Chloe? Chloe! Be careful! Is it okay if I speak and we use that? - Yeah. - Okay. My signing is adequate, but, this will get fairly detailed. Okay, so, your address. Oh, that's Cape Cod, isn't it? Is that where you're from? No, no, I'm from Maryland. I live there with my dad. He's a doctor. That's our old, like, summer house. I haven't been in years. We're selling it. Oh, I see. So how did you find out about us? Online. I've been following your project. And no cochlear implant? No, no the timing was never right. Oh, everyone is different. And with your hearing loss, profile, and speech, you are an excellent candidate for our study. I still see a speech therapist. Oh, okay. So, I have to ask. Why are you doing this? Regaining sensory ability can be quite jarring. I remember... hearing sounds... voices and... it's still... inside me. The silence, it's just something I've... adjusted to. But this... this is mine! Okay. Well, this is a stage one clinical trial. Right now, once mature auditory nerve cells are damaged, that's it. Hearing loss is irreversible. The purpose of this study is to change that. We are using an experimental gene editing technique that mimics prenatal cellular growth in the inner ear. The procedure itself is relatively simple. A stem cell-associated retrovirus is injected into your inner ear. This retrovirus will "infect" the surrounding tissue with a gene responsible for auditory cell growth. The damaged nerve fibers will grow back, restored. And your sense of hearing will return. You can probably take those bandages off now. Just wait to put your hearing aids back in until tomorrow. It could be weeks until we see results. Kind of like a cold. We have to allow it to run its course. Oh! Alright, use these drops twice a day. Once in the morning and once at night. Okay. It's a steroidal solution to increase cell growth and slow the immune response. You might experience some minor side effects. Increased heart rate, light headedness, dizziness, but nothing too serious. We're being hopeful. But, please remember that there is a strong possibility this may not work. Okay. Oh! Here you go. This is my card. Please don't hesitate to email or text me if you have any questions or problems. Okay. I'm Chloe. Chloe! Chloe! Mom! Be careful! Chloe! Be careful! Chloe! Mom! Chloe! Hold on, hold on. Okay... okay... can you say... can you say that again? I'm Hank Fowler, your dad called me about the water heater. Right. Yes, yes. Thank you. Yep. Sorry to startle you. Oh! You're little Chloe? Last time I saw you you were yay high. Yeah, that was like twelve years ago. How are you doing with your... I've adjusted. Your dad said you were in town for some sort of... study. Yeah. To restore my hearing. They can do that? Not yet. It's an experiment, but we're hopeful. Good luck with that, wow. I can get you hot water. It's in... I know... Should be good here. Okay. Your dad said you're looking to sell the place. I know he tried the Airbnb thing. Y-yeah... yeah, it's just too far for us. It's time. Yeah... I'd say. All right, well, if you need anything, just let me know. Actually there is one thing. All right, give it a try. That's the Swedes for you. This is older than you are. I wouldn't drive it back to Maryland without having it looked at first. Should have the roads to yourself this time of year. Though the off season could get lonely if you're not used to it. I saw a light on across the marsh last night. Could be late renters. Though the addicts like to squat in empty houses. There's a problem with that here. You'll be okay. I'm down at the harbor most days, they made me Harbormaster. If you need anything, I'm a call away. Or a text. I do that too. Yeah. My dad gave me your number. Thanks. - Can I help you with something? - Oh. Yeah. Is that your truck? It is. I'm cleaning out our old house and... I could use a truck. I know you. Your name is Chloe, right? We used to play together as kids. I'm Joshua. Do you remember me? Yeah. You got real sick and you lost your hearing and you never came back. We were wondering what was going to happen to your house. Sorry, can you hear me right now? Hmm. Uh. Do you live here? Yeah. My mom still owns them. I told her I thought I saw you the other day. You should come say hi. She didn't believe that you were really back. She ain't gonna bite. Come on. Mom. Brought the Grayden girl. Chloe. Told you she was back. Isn't she deaf? She is, but she makes do. Hello. I'm Ellen. I used to watch you when you were a toddler. I knew your mother. We went to high school together. Before she met your dad. How's he doing? He'll be out here in a couple of weeks. We're trying to sell the house. Sounds about right. Joshua. - Joshua! - What? There's that picture of the two of you. Can you get it? I want Chloe to see it! Where is it? It's in the yellow album with the stack of old photos. Your dad stopped coming out here after your mom... Can't blame him. It's real hard to take. It's still tough on him. We thought she'd just run off. Never heard from her? No. Nothing. Nothing. You look just like her. It's like seeing a ghost. Found it. Look. I remember this. Chloe. Say Happy Fourth of July. Happy Fourth of July! Say Happy Fourth of July. Happy Fourth of July! Chloe. Mom? Hey. Hey! Hello? Chloe? Dad. How are you calling me? Wait. Can you hear me? Yeah! I can hear you. I think it's working. Oh, my god. This is incredible... Well say something, please! I'm actually at a loss for words. I'm so happy for you. I can't believe this is real. After all this time, you can hear again. This is better than we could have ever expected. There's activity in 80 percent of the damaged cells along with new growth in the surrounding tissue. This is remarkable progress and so quickly, I mean... the range, the frequencies, it's... truly astonishing. I mean I can hear like... everything! My voice has changed so much and your voice is different than what I imagined it to sound like. In a good way, I hope. Yes, yes, it's fine, it's beautiful. It's just different. Well, yes, this can be overwhelming. We have therapists who can help with the transition. I can always hear things in my dreams, like memories and people, is that... weird? No. No, you were old enough to remember sounds when you lost your hearing. Not weird at all. Okay. So what now? Just keep doing what you're doing. Keep using the drops and if anything changes, anything at all, just... well, I guess, just call me. Woah. Yeah. Excuse me. Been awhile. Another one's gone missing. What do you mean? Cleaning up after her shift, never came home. No car, no body... No trace. Flying south for the winter. They use the earth's magnetic fields for their migratory patterns. This place... it does things to you. Yeah. Wait... could you hear me? Hey guys! Hello, how are you? How are you? It smells funny in here. Chloe? Sweetie, you got to go back to bed. Hello? Hello? Is somebody there? Who is this? [barely audible] Chloe? Say happy 4th of July. Say happy 4th of July. Say happy 4th of July. Chloe? Sweetie, you have to go back to bed. That's our wall of shame there. Am I crazy or is that treatment you're doing working? Yeah, it is. Ain't that something! It's freezing out here! You want a fisherman's warm up? Come on. Here you go. It's good for what ails you. So how does it feel? Hearing after all this time. Still getting used to it. I forgot how noisy the world is. Ain't that the truth. I saw you in a uniform. In my dad's old pictures. I... I didn't know you were police. Huh. Was police. Some junkie decided to give me an early retirement. Medals and all. Probably for the best. As a cop you... see things most people don't get to see. I don't miss it really. We looked for your mom. It was really hard to do. Yeah... That's the last time I remember really hearing anything. I still hear her voice. I... I wanted to tell you something. I saw you the other day with Joshua. -Ellen's boy. - Oh. You might want to be careful around them. He's been in some trouble. What kind of trouble? Uh... A few years back, uh... some pets were going missing. Dogs, primarily. All over the outer Cape. They couldn't prove it, but... I felt like he had something to do with it. Him and his ma, they're wired funny. She's had a rough go of it. Yeah. Thanks for the heads up. Hey, don't mention it. Hank... Do you have a drill I can borrow? Say Happy Fourth of July. Say Happy Fourth of July. Happy Fourth of July! Chloe... Be careful! Hello! Hello? Is anyone there? I'm from next door. Hello? Chloe? Sweetie, you gotta go back to bed. Chloe, say happy Fourth of July. You've reached the voicemail of Dr. Sophia Lynch with the Northeast Eye and Ear Institute. Please leave a message and I will return your call during office hours. Thank you. Dr. Lynch, it's Chloe Grayden. I know it's late... or early even... I'm so sorry to call you, I just, I think something's wrong with the procedure. There's been some bleeding. I'm getting ringing in my ears and it's getting worse. I don't mean to bother you. I just... I needed someone to talk to about all of this. Please just call me when you can. Bye. Shit. Hello? Hey, Chloe. Hank told me you came by to use his power drill. Is everything okay? Dad, yeah, yeah. I'm okay. Now why would you need a drill? Hello? Dad, I can't hear you. Now we talked about this... you... Please calm down, I'm fine. Dad? Sweetie, you gotta go back to bed. Chloe? Chloe, it's Dr. Sophia Lynch. Your ears look fine. You know, you are the first one to show positive results. - Really? - Mm-hmm. Am I the only one? So far, but, it's early. You are our star subject, though. It was working, like... really well. But I'm... hearing things. That's good, right? I mean, that's what's supposed to happen. No, like... like things that aren't there. Yeah, no people who have regained some... some hearing through cochlear implants they're often known to have auditory hallucinations. It can be hard to distinguish between what's real and what's imagined. It could just be symptoms of sensory overload. Sustained loud noises can, they can sound like voices. Chloe, this is a lot for anyone to handle. It could be helpful to talk through it. Have you reached out to any of the therapists we recommended? No. I'm sorry, I know it's my fault. No, no, it's... hey. How about you go get dressed and we get dinner? Yeah? - Yeah. - Let's get away from this place for a bit. Yeah, yeah, I'd like that. I'm realizing I only really know you from your file. What are you up to? Are you in school, or...? Kinda. I took the semester off. For your project, actually and to help my dad sell the house. Is it just the two of you? Yeah, my mom left when I was eight. Disappeared. We don't know, actually. I was the last person to see her. I mean I was in this... coma for six months from the meningitis. And I came out of it and I lost my hearing and my mom. Then got set back at school and... just like this black hole it's like... just, an invisible weight. But, it is what it is, right? Forces just beyond my control. You know I was thinking, maybe after this, I could like become a counselor or something for people who have the procedure. We really have quite a ways off from that. We have the trials, we have to get approvals... - Yeah, no I... - First... No, it's... I see. Maybe, yeah. Maybe down the road. - Yeah. - It could be helpful. Thank you. It sounds like television static. You know, I still see album covers and I see singers, what if the way that I imagine their songs is better than the way that they actually are, right? Oh, no I... I don't keep up with music or trends or anything like that, I just... you know, whatever's on. Yeah. Yeah, I remember like... bits of songs, like fragments. In my dreams, usually. I mean, I could always hear my mom though. It's like she was the only clear voice in my head the whole time. It's actually... that's... that's why I reached out to you and your project. I was never ashamed of my deafness but I felt like... if the volume of the world got turned back up again I wouldn't hear her anymore. Like... she'd stop calling me back here. Hmm... Do you still hear her? Of course not. Your process worked, didn't it? Maybe we should get the check. Just a minute, hold on. Do you know this? - No... no I don't. - I love it. ♪ The sun and sea are smiling ♪ When you're going to bed ♪ I wish Allah would will me ♪ A piece of iron in my head ♪ On my knees and wishing ♪ On my knees and breaking hands ♪ I can't get over how bright the stars are outside the city. Yeah. I wonder what they sound like. Sorry, it's gotten a little out of control. Oh, it's okay... there's always tomorrow... fresh start. It's... getting late. Yeah. You could stay if you want. I mean you could sleep on the couch or not. Oh, Chloe, I... Don't go. I... I really should... I'm sorry. You know, there's something else I need to say. You weren't totally honest with me. When your results were so positive, I followed up on you. I had to. What do you mean? You should've told me you were taking antidepressants. It could corrupt the study. And your mental state with your mom and... that can make everything so much harder than it already is. I don't see how that matters right now. Of course it matters. It all matters. I have to protect the project. You should've been honest with me. You are the first person in the history of human kind to have regained your hearing like this... Shoot. Okay, hold on, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I... I didn't mean to upset you, I just... No, no, I get it, I should... I should've told you about my prescription. Oh, my god. Sorry, I'm just... I think I'm going to puke, I'm sorry. Chloe? Come in. They just won't stop ringing. I really messed this up, didn't I? Shit. Dr. Lynch? Joshua? Joshua? Saw your car. What is all this? I knew it, you can hear. - It's not like that. - Have you been faking? You've been watching me. You're the one next door. We take care of that house. I heard you throwing a party. - You kept me up all night. - Wait, what? - I heard you, okay? - Wait, what are you talking about, you heard a party? No one's been over there except for me. Okay. I'm not stupid, I'm not crazy, stop this shit! Wait. I saw something at your dad's cottage months ago. That's why I've been watching it, to try to figure out what's there. I mean I thought I was seeing things, hearing things and then you showed up. They're vibrations. Frequencies. All around us, magnetic fields, things that we can't see or hear. But you can. It's a spirit world. This is an ultrasound. It's been adjusted to pick up frequencies beyond our senses. Listen. What are you hearing right now? Nothing. Why did you come back here? Chloe? It wasn't a choice. Something called you here... - Your mother. - Stop it. Wait, listen! Stop it! Stop! - Wait! - Stop it! Stop! - Stop! Stop! It's just fucking noise! - Wait, just... If I see you over at my house again I'm calling the police. Don't be like this. Can't you see? Don't fight it! You stay away from me. Stay away from my house, please. You've reached the voice mail of Dr. Sophia Lynch with the Northeast Eye and Ear Institute. Please leave a message and I will return your call during office hours. Thank you! Hi, Dr. Lynch? Sophia, sorry. It's Chloe. What happened to you? I mean, I woke up and you were gone. I know I screwed things up... I just want to talk it through. Make it better. Please call me. Chloe? Mom? Chloe, is that you? I can see you. My god, how did you get so big? Can you hear me okay? Good. That's good. Your dad... he called me, he was concerned when you didn't pick up your phone. With the storm, he wanted me to come check on you. And with good cause. You were... laying on the floor. Your ears were bleeding. We should call Dr. Lynch. - I have her cell number somewhere. - Hold on, hold on, hold on, hey... Your doctor is not coming out here in this weather. Don't worry that's the power grid trying to keep up with the storm. I've got a generator. I'll go get it going. Hey, you can relax now. Have some tea. Storm's going to pass in the morning. It's going to be okay. I just know it. Okay. Okay. Thank you. You're standing! That's good. Yeah... I feel kind of dizzy. Come sit down. Your feet cold? I'm feeling like the chills. You're safe here. You can relax now. I'm going to take care of you. Where's your bathroom? It's over here. You okay in there? Yeah... just feeling really sick. Please give me a few minutes. That tea's going to make it all better. All better. What was that? Nothing. Dropped something. You okay in there? No, just... just... give me a minute. I can hear them. Hear what they're saying. Do you hear them? I hear them. The ones I took care of. Chloe, you hear me? Chloe, what are you doing in there? Open the goddamn door, sweetheart. Chloe! Chloe! Chloe! Get back here. Chloe! Sophia? No... Chloe? I know you're here. Chloe! Chloe I know you're out here! I'm trying to help you, I'm sorry! You don't understand. Chloe. Hey! Get back here! Chloe. Sweetie, you gotta go back to bed. Chloe. Say Happy Fourth of July. Say Happy Fourth of July. Say Happy Fourth of July. Say Happy Fourth of July. Hello... how are you? You know he left for work earlier, so he'll be back tonight. I don't think you should be here. Please, please! Where else could you go? You're all alone out here. Hey, hey, it's just me and you now. We can talk about this. You even sound like her. No! No! If you could only hear what I hear. Can you hear me? Please stop. Please stop. Stop. Chloe? Joshua! Chloe? Chloe! Chloe? Joshua. Help me out here. - What's going on? - She's having some kind of breakdown, - I called an ambulance. - I heard her scream... This is not good for you. This is not good at all. Joshua. Hey! Hey! - I'm sorry... - No, let's go! Come on. Come on. You go. What? God damnit! Now you fucking hear me? What is that? Sorry... Where's your cell phone? We need to call 9-1-1. Hey, hey. Okay, okay. No... Chloe? Say Happy Fourth of July. Say Happy Fourth of July. Mom. Say Happy Fourth of July. Say Happy Fourth of July. Say Happy Fourth of July. Say Happy Fourth of July.
