- I see you've met the neighbours. Ah, just like clockwork. - I don't think the restaurantis going to let you in like that. - We can always order in. - Or you could put your pants on. - Sure. I love keeping this apartment. After a long day at the office, you're tired, lots of stress. You need some place where you can get out of your clothes and slip into something comfortable. - Who's this? - That is my wife. She had a stroke 2 years ago, her 2nd. She slipped into a coma. The damage was massive and irreversible. - I'm sorry, I didn't know. - Thank you, but now I've mourned her, and I want to move on with the rest of my life. Do you think that's heartless? - No. Life goes on. - You're very philosophical. So how about that trip to Aspen? - Damn. - Parker. [ Telephone ] - Deaton Investigation, Parker here. - [Whispering]: Heads or tails? - Heads. - Ooh, sorry. - Yeah, what's your name? Lewis. How do you spell that? - Hey. - Anything interesting? - His wife's in a coma... stroke. The prognosis isn't helpful. - I'll be sure to send my condolences as soon as she gets back from the spa. Have you got the tape? - You should have heard this guy, Jack. I would have bought life insurance from him. - Thanks. Here, I've got another job for you. - Yeah. - It pays $800. - What's the catch? - The wife wants to catch her husband in the act. - Oh no, forget it. Get Denise, she gets off on confrontations. - She isn't working for awhile. Don't give me a hard time on this, all right. You're the best decoy I've got. Nobody gets those cheating husbands talking like you do. - I could use an advance. - What a surprise. Here you go. - Thank you. - I want you to take this. - Uh, no. - You know how much it cost me to get you licensed and certified. - And I told you I don't like guns. - Well, neither do the bad guys. Just do it for me. It'll make me feel better. Just take it, put it in your purse. You'll get used to it. - Happy? - Yeah. So, you want to grab a bite or something? My treat. - You know, I just want to go home and take a bath. - You need someone to wash your back? - I think I can handle it. Hey Denise. Listen, Jack said... - Hey, kiddo. - Denise, oh my God. - Jimmy. - You can't let him keep doing this to you. - I know. It's the last time. [ Hushed voices ] - I'm going to call the cops. - No, look, it's okay. He was just drunk. - Denise, you can't let him keep doing this to you. - I know, I told him this was the last time, and I mean it. This is it. - Why don't you come stay with me, okay? You don't have to go back there. - Hey, look, I've got to go sucker an advance out of Scrooge. - Denise. - Look, I'll just... I'll call you later. - Hey! - Hey, killer. - I thought you had a date. Oh, that bad, huh? - A bargain matinee, and a Chinese happy meal. How about you? - I got an invitation to Aspen. - Oh wow. Does he have a friend? - No, a wife. - Oh, nice. What is it this time? - Irreversible coma. - 9.8 for originality. So Aspen, huh? Do you think he'd let you bring a friend? Guess not. - What are we watching? - True story. Okay: this guy, he kidnaps this girl, and keeps her in a box for 7 years, and then they get married. And what bugs me is that she has a better social life than me. - Well, sure, it looks good right now but in a couple of years, he'll get bored. He'll kidnap someone else. - God, you're cynical. [ Phone ringing ] Just leave it, Erin. Erin, just leave it. This is Julie. - [Male voice]: Hello, Julie. Hello, Erin. - What do you want? - [Telephone]: I know you're there, Erin. I'm going to make you pay, you bitch. - He calls the minute I get home. - He's just trying to scare you. - Yeah, well, it's working. - Look, why don't you tell Jack? He can trace it or something. - No, he'll stop sending me out. - And that would be bad how? - I need the work. - Look, I'll get you something at the travel agency. - Maybe you're right. Maybe he's just trying to scare me. I have heard when a wife leaves her husband's house, as I am doing now, that he is legally free from all his obligations. You're not to feel bound in anyway, and nor shall I. I'm sorry... can I try that again? - Why? That was very good. - I can do it better. Please. - All right. - Listen, Torvold. I have heard when a wife leaves her husband's house, as I am doing now, he's legally freed from all his obligations to her. And now I set you free from them. You're not to feel yourself bound in any way, and nor shall I. We both must be perfectly free. Look, here's your ring back. Give me mine. - Erin, Erin, wait up. I just wanted to tell you that you were terrific. I mean it, you blew me away in there. - What do you want Chet? - I made a mistake, okay. - No, a mistake is when you give a cabbie a 20 instead of a 10. Getting laid in my bed on my birthday with my friends outside... - Um, yeah... - ...that's tasteless stupidity. - Erin, come on, I mean, it didn't mean anything. I didn't even know her name. - It was Jenny. Excuse me. - Hey, you know what, maybe I did it because I was sick of you being so sure I would! - Excuse me, could I get a spot? - Sure. - Just five. See anything you like? - Sorry. - That's okay, everybody does it. - Actually, I come here to get away from everyone. - Well then, I'm flattered. - Max Gardner. - Erin. - Erin. Well, you're in great shape, Erin. - Hm, thanks. I work hard at it. - How come I haven't seen you here before? - I don't live around here. In fact, that's it for me. Thanks for the spot. - Anytime. - Do you know a good place to eat around here? - Do you like Italian? - Yeah, I love it. - So the lights go on and this polar bear goes berserk. People are stampeding off the set. Cut to me, walking out of the bathroom, oblivious. I'm trying to come up with a concept for this new laundry detergent. Suddenly I realize I'm all alone with this 1,500 lb. polar bear who's just eaten a Volkswagen. - Oh my God, what did you do? - I back pedalled fast, tripped over a cable, landed on my butt. My life is flashing before my eyes. And in the same instant, I came up with the perfect commercial. The next thing I know, the polar bear's licking my face. - Get out of here. - On my mother's life. - Wow. - You've got a nice laugh. - Thank you. - Good food, huh? - Delicious. - So, do you like where you're living? - Yeah, yeah, it's pretty. - It must help to be with someone you like an awful lot. Are you? - No one in particular. What about you? Married? Hmm. - They have great desert. - Stuffed really. I mean, dinner was great. - How about a nightcap? - Hmm. Well then, why don't you get the cheque? Change your mind? - No, but you may want to. Look I... I haven't been entirely honest with you. I implied that I'm not married, and that's not true. At least not technically. - And what's that supposed to mean? - Short version: I am married, but it's not working, hasn't been for a long time, and it's not going to. Still want to invite me in? - I'll let you decide. Not here. - It's nice, cozy. You're going to have to cut me some slack. I'm a bit out of practice. - Max! I knew it. Why? Why? I tried everything for you, Max. What more do you want from me? What? What? - Just relax, Mr. Gardner. You've got enough problems on your hands. I'm a private investigator. Erin. - Erin! - Why don't you have a seat and relax, Mr. Gardner? Take a seat. - Here you go. - Thank you. - Look, don't get down on yourself just because some dip got caught with his hand in the honey pot. - I know, Jack. Maybe we just make it too easy for them. - What, do you think this guy wasn't dirty before? Look, I don't even get a call unless the problem is too big to ignore. - Have you ever cheated on your wife, Jack? - No, not the first one. Of course, we were only together for a couple of months. The other two, you know, I don't know. A couple, 3 times, maybe just sports sex, it didn't mean anything. - Men are such jerks. - It's chemical, and in this study they injected these women with testosterone. The only thing these babes wanted to do was go out and get laid. - Do any women buy into this load of crap? - No, they're too busy blaming their bitchiness on PMS. - That's a good one, ha, ha, ha. - You know, I've been told I give the best hand massage in the whole state. Here, give me your hand. How does that feel? - Good. Buy me another one? - No, I think you've had enough. - Oh no. What, are you my father? - If that works for you. - My father was a bastard. - So am I. - Hmm... Jack. - Yeah. - Maybe I've had a little too much to drink. Thanks for the drink. - Hey... why don't you come by the office tomorrow or the next day? I have something for you. It won't be like tonight. That's smooth, Jack, that's real smooth. - All's fair in love and war, and business is war. Don't let anybody tell you different. - So what do I have to do to get ahead? - Sleep with the boss. - The boss is married. - How badly do you want to get ahead? - Erin, what a surprise. What's it been: 2-3 weeks? Mind if I sit down? - I don't believe we know each other. I'm Dale Williams. - I see you're working again. - She works for me. - Is that right? What exactly do you do? - We were just discussing that. And if you don't mind, this is sort of a private dinner. - That's okay. Erin owes me a dinner. - Max, why don't I call you? We could get together a little bit later in the week, huh? - You don't have my phone number. - You could give it to me. - Mm. I don't think so. - The lady said she'd call you, so why don't you take off? - How's your wife Dale? You are married, aren't you? - What business is that of yours? - It's not my business. It's hers. - Do you know this nut? - I'm sorry, no, I don't... - Didn't she give you a resume? She must have left out the part about working for the detective agency. Did you leave that out again? - What's he talking about? - I'm really not sure. - Tell him, honey. Tell him how the wives hire you to set up their hubbies. How you record them on that microphone you've got hidden. Where exactly do you hide that microphone? - Look, I was just kidding about... you know. I knew who you were all along. I was just playing a little joke. I love my wife. You're fired. - So, what am I having? Good choice. I hope you can afford this. - What do you want, Max? - It must have been a lot of fun seeing the look on my face the other night. Do you go home, compare notes with your friends, have a good laugh? - Hey, I wasn't the one cheating on my wife. - No, but I didn't lie. I didn't tell you I was someone I wasn't, and I didn't set you up. Erin! [ Erin coughs. ] [ Car picks up speed ] - [Scared]: Ah! Ah! [ Car crashes against the metal ] [ Screeching tires ] [Scared]: Ah! Ah! - Don't shoot! It's me! It's Max! - You tried to kill me! - What? No way! - You're lying. - Erin, put down the gun. - You're lying. - I was looking for you to apologize. I saw you run in the alleyway. Look, if you don't believe me, go to the car and call the police. Erin. Please. You're hurt, you're hurt. Let me help you. Erin. Erin. Now. Shh, shh, shh. It's okay, it's okay, it's okay. Here, it's okay. Come on, come on. I'll get you to the hospital. Come on. - Just take me home. I want to go home. Thanks for the ride. - You could be in shock. Maybe I should stay for a few minutes just to make sure. - My roommate will be home any minute. [ Phone rings ] Hello. - [Male voice]: Hi Erin, who's your friend? - I told you not to call anymore. [ Caller chuckles ] - [Frightened]: Oh! - Sorry, you okay? - It's just an old boyfriend. - Why don't you go get cleaned up? I'll fix you a drink. Your drink's on the coffee table. How are you feeling? - Oh my God, he was trying to kill me. - We should call the police. - And tell them what? I didn't see anything. - What about the car? Did you get a good look at the car? - Only that it was the same colour as yours. How did you know I would be at that restaurant? You followed me? - I just wanted the chance to explain about my marriage. - Look, if you're going to give me that bit about how your wife doesn't understand you, just do me a favour and save us both the time, okay? - It's more like I don't understand her. Over the last year or so, she's become so paranoid, jealous. I have never cheated on my wife. You would have been the first. - Am I supposed to feel flattered? - No. Look, I liked you. You need to hear a bit. My marriage has been over for a long, long time. I built our ad agency from a struggling shop to a top boutique. Dina's the largest shareholder. - Well, sounds like you shouldn't have any problem getting another job. - Sure, if I want to walk away from millions of dollars. The agency is about to be sold. If we're married, I get half; if we're divorced, not a penny. That's why she hired you. She needed the grounds to sue for divorce. - Okay. Well then Max, if your wife's so jealous, why doesn't she just give you a divorce? - I know this is going to sound crazy, but I think she believes that if I'm desperate enough, I'll come crawling back to her. You don't trust anyone, do you? - Max, I have decoyed 52 married men. Out of them, 49 tried to sleep with me and everyone had a story. - That still leaves 3. - One was gay. I imagine the other two had equally compelling reasons. - So all men are lying lecherous bastards? - Hmm. - What was it? A lousy marriage or a crappy childhood? - Ooh, advertising by day, psychology by night. - I guess I didn't do a very good job at patching things up. Don't suppose we could try dinner again? - Jack has this silly policy about dating his clients' husbands. - Yeah. Goodnight. - Goodnight. - Erin! Erin! Wake up, wake up! Your agent is on the phone. Get up! She has a job for you today! Come on, come on, come on. I'm serious. - Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Yahoo! Iceberg Cove, more chill, less fill. - And cut... that was great, Erin! That's great. - Thank you. - I'm almost glad our lead actress got sick. I want your agent to call me, okay? I have some other projects coming up. - Okay, great. Well, listen, I really, really appreciate the opportunity. - Don't thank me, thank him. He's the one who found your photo. Got to go, babe. - You stole my headshot? - I never said I was a choirboy. - Well, this doesn't change anything. And don't expect me to feel obligated in any way. - I don't play casting couch games. If you weren't right, you wouldn't be here, okay? - Okay. - Good. How about dinner? - Oh, God! - That's a yes? You look good as a bear. - Thank you. - Yeah. - Where'd you say we were eating again? - I didn't. It's a surprise. - You're kidding, right? - Look, I know this is hard for you, but try to trust me. - Wow! - I've been working on it for the past 2 years. I still have lots to do. - Oh my God, how did you ever find this place? - Actually, it belonged to my grandfather about a million years ago. He was a painter. This was his studio. - Are all of these yours? - Yes. - You're very talented. - This one is giving me some troubles. - I think it's coming along beautifully. Did your grandfather teach you how to paint? - He taught me how to see. When I was 9, I could draw an exact likeness. You would have been impressed. Everyone was, except for my grandfather. He said my drawings were lifeless, that I had missed the shadows within the shadows. You see, if I would have drawn you then, I would have neglected the darkening below your cheekbone. It's almost subliminal. And there's the fairest highlights, tightness in the muscle, the tug in your laugh line. - I was working 2 waitress jobs, and just wasn't making ends meet. - A lot of lousy tippers? - A lot of bills. So anyway, I saw this ad in Backstage: good money, plenty of time for acting. Still, I wasn't really sure I wanted to do it. Then Jack explained to me how normal surveillance usually takes months. It could cost a woman thousands, and then they might not even know for sure. With a decoy, within a few weeks, they know for sure. - What about the guy that's say, 45, been bald since he was 15, married the first woman that ever smiled at him who somehow gains 6 dress sizes on their honeymoon? Now, out of his fantasy steps you: the kind of woman who makes men buy beer. Do you ever wonder that it might be you, and not him? - It's not like that, because let me tell you something. Women are infinitely better at deceiving themselves than any man. I watched my mother do it, and when he finally had the decency to leave us, I watched her crawl into a bed and stay there for 2 years. So yeah, yeah, I get paid to test fidelity, and you know what? Most men cheat, but at least their wives won't have to wonder anymore. - I know this is hard for you right now, but there are relationships that work. Built on trust. - Yeah, I think there's a museum with one. - You're a hard case, Ms. Greer. - It doesn't stop, does it Max? It just never stops. - I'm sorry about tonight. - It's okay. - The only other time she was at the loft, she refused to get out of the car. - Everything happens for a reason. - I guess I'm not invited in. - You're invited... when you're a free man. - That could be 6 months, maybe more. - It'll test your character. I loved the picnic. - I want to see you again. - Make it soon. Goodnight. [To herself]: Erin, Erin, Erin, what are you doing? Jack is so going to kill me. - When you break the rules, you don't screw around, huh? [ Knocking ] - I meant in a couple of days. What are you doing... Jack! What are you doing here? - You should check your messages. - I was out. - So I noticed. - What's up? - Come on, we've got to go. We'll talk about it in the car. - Later. - Later. - Oh my God! Denise. - What's going on, D? - All we know for sure is that she was stabbed 5 times. No murder weapon. The perp must have taken it. Her pocketbook wasn't touched, nothing was missing from her apartment, and there was no sign of a break in. We're guessing she knew him. - It had to have been Jimmy. He was always beating her up. - Yeah, so I heard. We got an APB out on him. - Good. - Just for the record: where were the two of you last night between 9 and 11? - What are you, kidding? - Come on, Deaton, you know the drill. - I can't even remember what I had for breakfast. - Ms. Greer? - I was out. - With? - A friend. - And your friend can verify that? - Yeah. - Something else, Ms. Greer? - I've been getting threatening phone calls lately, and last night someone tried to run me down. - Did you report it? - No, I didn't see the driver. - Did you recognize the car? - No. - Do you have any enemies you can think of? A dispute over a parking space, anything? - No. - What about this guy, Jimmy? Did you have words with him? An argument? - I barely even know him. - All right, it may just be a coincidence. But just to be safe, don't go out alone. My first thing tomorrow morning I want you to come in and fill out a report. I'll put a trace on your phone and Jack... - Yeah. - If you can remember what 2-buck hooker took pity on you last night, give me a call, all right? - No, I got it now. It was your wife. - She's all yours. - Excuse me. - We have a lot to talk about, you and I. - Oh, would you give me a break, Jack? I just found out Denise was murdered. - I want to know what's going on. - Nothing. Look, I didn't want to tell you because I was afraid you wouldn't let me work. - You're damn right you're not working. - You know... You know I need the money. - You need money? Fine. Here. - Come on, Jack. - Take it. - Not like that. - It's a gift, and you're staying with me until we find this guy. - This is exactly what I'm talking about. I don't need you to take care of me, Jack. - What, did you find someone else to do the job? Huh? - Maybe I have. - Oh wait, now let me guess. His wife has an irreversible coma. - Screw you. - I'm trying to tell you something here, Erin. This guy is bad news. - You don't know that. - Oh the hell I don't. I've been dealing with scumbags like him for 20 years. - You're jealous. - You're talking crazy, here, is what you're talking now. - No, you are. You're jealous. - Where you going? - To find a cab. - Just get in the damn car. Look, just get in the car... please. - I'm not going to stop seeing him. - Look, why don't you come by the office next week because I've got some files that need to be cleaned out? - You know, it started out as such a good day. I got my first commercial. - Ah, I guess you won't be working for me for too much longer then, huh? - No, no, I didn't... I mean, it's... it's only a local. - No. It's okay babe, you were always way too classy for this crap. You always took it too seriously. I'm happy for you, really. [ Loud crash, dogs barking ] [ Shouting ] - Julie, you scared the hell out me. - You scared the hell out of me. - Oh, my God. What's going on? Erin? - Denise was murdered. - Oh, my God. Jimmy? [ Faint sound of steps ] Oh, that son of a bitch. She was so scared to be alone. He just picked her apart until she didn't even know who she was. [ Loud crash ] It's probably just a pigeon. No, Erin, just leave it, okay? - I won't be able to sleep unless I'm sure. - Okay, but... [ Dog barking in distance. ] - Erin, come on, you're giving me the creeps. Erin, would you just come back inside? Erin, come on. Come on, come on, come on. [ She laughs. ] What? - It was just a pigeon. - I'm going to sleep now. Bite me. - Well, that was great, that was really great. Let's bring it back next week, all right? Thank you. Erin, hang in for a second? - You're beating a dead horse. - I know, forget that. Did you ever hear of Sandro Guest? - Twelve hits, 23 Tonies, yeah, yeah, I think I might have heard of him. - Well, he's heard of you too. - Really? How? - From me, for one thing. He also caught that workshop with you at the Circle Rep. He's considering you for the 2nd lead in his new production. - Come on, Chet, don't yank my chain. - I'm not, Erin. I'm not, I'm not. I swear to God. I swear. - You're serious? Sandro Guest? My God, do you have any idea what this could mean for my career? - Well, it would give you 1, that's for sure. - Oh my God, this is incredible. - Hey, hey, look, look. It's not 100%. He's still considering a couple of other actresses but I mean, you're definitely the front runner. - This is great. - I took the liberty. Saturday night at 9 and this is where you go. You know what, I hear that his place is amazing. - His place? - Yeah, you know, so you can get to know each other. Hey, Erin, that's the way it works. You know that. - What, you're pimping me out? - What, are you out of your mind? You sleepwalk through this part, it's a guaranteed nomination. - I don't think I want it that bad. - Listen, listen, you nail it, it's a statue. I mean this is it, babe, this is the rocket ship. Don't blow it. I'd kill for a shot like this. - Then you sleep with him. - Whoa! - Hi. What are you doing here? - Tough class? - Yeah, yeah, we learned how to prostitute ourselves for the sake of our art. How did you know I'd be here? Follow me again? - No, I only stalk on first dates. This time I coerced it from your roommate. Listen, Julie told me what happened to your friend. How are you holding up? I thought maybe you might want to grab a bite, and talk. - I promised my mom I'd meet her for lunch. - I'll take you both out. - Oh, thanks, but I don't think that's such a good idea. - I can be extremely charming. - Yeah, a little too charming. - Erin? - Mom, I brought someone with me today. This is Max. Max... Mom. - It's nice to meet you, Mrs. Greer. - [Mother]: Not too many Max's these days. - I'll be right back, excuse me. - Ms. Greer, we've tried to be patient, but I'm afraid you'll just have to make other arrangements for your mother. - No, wait. I... have a cheque. - You two are very close. - Yes. - Tell me all about Erin, Mrs. Greer. - This only covers half the bill. I'm sorry. I'll be happy to recommend some excellent-- - Please, please, this place is the best. My mother deserves it for once in her life please. I'll sign whatever you want-- - She kept me up half the night wandering the streets, but we never found him. Probably got hit by a car. - I just need a little more time. - I bought her another puppy but she wouldn't even look at him. - All right. - I think she thought he might run away. - Just like her father. - Max, don't you hurt my daughter. - I would never hurt your daughter, Mrs. Greer. - Let me feel you face. - [Whispering]: Mom's blind. - I have no idea what I'm doing. I've only been blind a month. The therapist says I should practice, like I've got enough time left to learn this crap. - Hey, don't talk like that. - You've got nice skin anyway. - Thank you. - You like my daughter, Max? - Yes I do, very much. - That's good. That's good. - Yeah I know, I know Barry. I know what she's trying to do, but don't worry about it. Of course, of course. I've got it taken care of. Right. I won't. Okay, okay. I'll talk to you tomorrow. Thanks. - What's going on, Max? - Did anybody ever tell you you should be an Ivory girl? - What's up? - Leave it. You've got enough of your own problems. - Talk to me. - It's Dina. That was Barry, my lawyer. He said that Dina is going to use the tape you made to sue for divorce. - Oh God, I'm sorry. - For what? For what? Hey, look. It's a non-issue. Dina doesn't know it, but I have the combination to her safe. And as of yesterday, she no longer has the tape. I'd love to see the expression on her face. - Wait, but she can get a copy. - I doubt she's thought that far ahead. - No, I mean from Jack. He keeps all the originals. She can get a copy from him. - I'd better call Barry. - No wait, I'll... - What? - I'll get it for you. - No, Erin, it's not right. I won't let you do it. - Yes, you will. You wouldn't be in this mess if it wasn't for me. It's all my fault. - Hey. Are you sure? - Here you go! - Thanks. - Mrs. Gardner, I believe you know my associate, Ms. Greer? - Pleasure. - Yes, of course. - And this is Parker. - Hi. - Right this way. We'll be in the conference room, if anyone needs me. - Erin, you wouldn't have a cigarette? - Sorry. - I guess I'll just cough. [ Coughing ] - Hey listen, why don't you go and get some? I'll watch the phones for you. - Thanks, you're an angel. - Don't tell anyone. - I'll be right back, Mrs. Gardner. Where the hell is everybody? Where's Erin? - I don't know. She was here when I left. - [Jack]: You ever thought about a course in people skills, Parker? - Give me a night off. - Quit smoking. - Jack! - What are you doing in here? - You caught me. It was gonna be a surprise. - What surprise? - I finished organizing the main files in the office, and I was going to come in here and help you out with your personal files, sort of just to thank you for everything that you've done for me. - I appreciate that babe, but you know I kind of have my own filing system worked out, and I really don't like anybody touching my stuff. - Fair enough. - But, thanks. That's nice. I just want to get something. If you don't mind, I want you to go in the conference room with me. There's something I want you to hear. I think it's important. Okay? Okay, let's go. Mrs. Gardner, if you'd please tell my associate what you just told me? - Is it really necessary I go through all this again with her? - Look, I know it's difficult. Please. - My husband can be rather charming when he wants something, as I'm sure you know, Ms. Greer. Most sociopath's are charming. I mean, he only married me for my money. I should have realized that when he threatened to call off the engagement after my father insisted on a prenuptial agreement. But I was in love. - But he signed the agreement? - He had no choice. If he refused, my father would have cut me out of the will. - So, why don't you just give him some money and get out of the marriage? - I offered him money, Ms. Greer, but he's refused! - If you really wanted a divorce, you could get one. - Now, hold it. It's not so easy in this state. There's only four reasons for a contested divorce and you've got to prove them: cruelty, abandonment, imprisonment-- - And adultery. I have paid you a considerable sum, Mr. Deaton. I hope I'm not wasting my money here. - She will cooperate. You have my word. - I will be needing some kind of protection. My husband has said that if I ever try to divorce him, he would try to kill me. You don't believe me. Do you know that my father was murdered, Ms. Greer? He was on a business trip, and someone broke into his hotel suite, and smashed his skull in with a lamp. Max was in the adjoining room. Slept through the whole thing, or so he says. And my lawyer has filed for the necessary papers and has issued a temporary restraining order. But I believe that once my husband gets wind of this, despite what your subordinate may think, my husband will try to kill me. And I'm scared, Mr. Deaton. He has gotten so much worse, and I'm scared. - Everything's going to be all right, I promise. Parker, I want you to go home and look after Mrs. Gardner. Don't worry, he's very good at his job. Look, you call me if you need anything. - This way, lady. - She's lying. - Why? She's the one filing for divorce, Erin. - She's trying to control him with the money. - Did it ever occur to you that Max might have been the one that tried to run you down? - No. - You set him up, Erin. You're being subpoenaed to testify at his trial. You're the star witness. Would you give me a break? - You don't see it. She's the one that's lying, Jack. - Keep your mouth shut, bitch! Shh. - Ahh! Ahh! Help me! Somebody, help! [ Ripping cloth ] - I'm going to make you pay! - [Jack]: Son of a bitch! - No Jack. Jack! Stop! Jack that's enough! Jack, stop it. - Come here! [ Police siren ] It's all right. It's okay, it's over. You're safe. [ Busy office ] - I take it you know our boy in here? - Yeah, his name is Chester Gortner. His wife was a client of mine. Erin tagged him a couple of months ago. - Yeah, well, we checked his phone records. He made a couple of dozens calls to your number, mostly from his car phone. It seems when his wife found out about his activities, she ditched him. He blames you, of course. - So he's the one that tried to run me down. - He swears he didn't, but then again, he claims not to have made the calls. I've got a guy going to impound his car today, and we're checking his whereabouts on the night of Denise Sandler's death. - But I thought Jimmy... - No, he's got an airtight alibi. 30 witnesses have him passed out at a bar. We still think that she knew him. Is it possible that this Gortner guy knew Denise? - No, not that I know of. - All right, we'll check it out anyway. If it's any consolation, Ms. Greer, he was really sorry for what he did to you. [ Phone ringing ] - Hello? - [Max]: You're finally home. I've been trying to reach you all night. - You paid my mother's bill. - I may have eavesdropped. I hope you're not mad. - No, no I'm not mad. Thank you, Max. - You're welcome. There's so much I need to tell you. - Me too. Can you come over? - I can't. Dina somehow got a restraining order. I'm not even allowed to be at the... when she's there-- [ Static ] - You're breaking up, where are you? - I'm at the loft. Look, I can't talk now, but there's this awards dinner tomorrow night. I'm being honoured, and I want you there with me, and to spend the weekend. - What about Dina? - To hell with Dina and to hell with the money. I don't want to wait for you. - Yes, of course I'll come. [ Car horn ] What was that? - I can't hear you, hello? If you can hear me... I'll call you tomorrow, okay? - Wait, Max, I need to tell you... Max. - [Max's voice]: Hi, it's Max. - Hi, it's me again-- - I'm not home right now, but please leave a message, and I'll get back to you as soon as I can. [ Tape rewinding ] - [Max]: So what exactly are you looking to do? - [Denise]: I'm interested in writing but I would work with you, Max, in any capacity. - I'd like to help you out, Denise. [ Click ] I have never cheated on my wife. [ Tape rewinding ] [ Click ] - [Max]: I'd like to help you out, Denise. To become a writer, that is. Let's just keep it professional. Otherwise, it gets too complicated. Agreed? - [Denise]: Whatever you say. I can't help but be disappointed though. - I'm flattered really but it has to be this way. [ Click ] [ Tape rewinding ] - [Max]: I'd like to help you out, Denise, to become a writer that is. [ Click ] [ Dog barking ] [ Gun cocking ] - Hi, Erin. Oh, let me help you with those. - What are you doing here, Chet? - Actually, I was just leaving. - Hey. - I bumped into Chet. - You're not upset, are you? - Hey, you're over 18. You can sleep with whoever you like. - No, I can't. You don't have a clue, do you? I mean, men just throw themselves at you. - Oh, please. - They end up with me by attrition. - God, you don't even know how terrific you are. - Oh please, have you seen my last 3 dates? - Julie. - I get lonely, Erin. And I know, I know that Chet is not Mr. Right. I mean he's not even Mr. So-So. But he's easy to look at, and for a little while I even got to pretend that he was here to be with me, and not just to get back at you. - Come here. You are so stupid sometimes. - Yeah, yeah. So what's all this, huh? Max again? - It's just some fancy schmancy dinner. - It's okay, killer. I'm used to living vicariously through you. Come on. Come on. - You look great. [ Click of a door opening ] I don't know. I think the black strapless. - What's wrong? - I've got to talk to Jack. - Why? - I've got to stop decoying. - What do you mean? If I don't, Max and I don't stand a chance. - Well, it's about time. Oh my God. So guess what, guess what? - What? - I have a date tonight. - Who is he? Who is he? Tell me. Tell me. - Well, I answered a personal. Okay? - Oh, geez. - No, no, no, it's not like that. - Come on. - No it's not like that. He's smart, and he's got a good sense of humour. - And you got all this in 3 lines? Oh, I love you. Anyone that gets you should consider themselves unbelievably lucky. - That's right. - And do you know why they should consider themselves unbelievably lucky? Because they'll no longer fear death. - Oh, you are such a bitch. You are dead. [ Phone ringing ] Hello? - [Jack]: Julie. - Hey, Jack. - Look, I need to speak to Erin. - Yeah, yeah, hold on. I'll get her. Erin? Jack's on the phone. Erin, it's Jack. He says it's important. Wow! - No, I'm through with you, Jack. Why didn't you tell me Denise already decoyed Max and he wasn't interested, instead of trying to convince me he was just another creep? - I'm on my way over there. - No, don't bother. - So cannot afford this, even if it does look unbelievably great. - How? - He was guarding Dina. Somebody shot him. He probably would have got to her too if the dog hadn't scared him off. - Do they know who? - No, look-- - Oups! Ah! - [Jack on phone]: Look, just promise me you won't leave. You may be in danger, so promise me. - Okay. - Ahh! Ahh! Erin! Erin! - Julie? Julie? Julie! Oh God, no! Please no! The doctor says she's lost a lot of blood. They won't know anything for sure until tomorrow. I'll call you if there are any changes, okay? Bye. - Erin, I am so sorry. - Please don't. - Why? - Where were you last night, Max? - I told you. - Yes, Parker and Denise are both dead, Julie's stabbed, and here you are again. - I don't know what's gotten into you, or what you think I've done, but you're wrong. You're wrong. - I'd like it if you left, please. - I don't believe this. I've got 300 people waiting to honour me, but I thought you might need me more. If you come to your senses, you know where I'll be. I'm sorry about Julie. I like her. I like you, too. No matter how hard you make it for me. - Ms. Greer? - Yes. - Will you come with us please? - Why? What is this about? - Police matter. - What did I do? [ Hand slamming table hard ] Please, I don't know what you're talking about. - Cut the crap, Ms. Greer. Your little game is over. You got that? Over. Now you can continue playing dumb and you're looking at 5 to 10 hard time. Or you can cooperate with us, and you walk away with a slap on the wrist. Now what's it going to be? - Why are you doing this to me? - All right, that's enough. She doesn't know anything. We're sorry about this, Ms. Greer. But we had to be sure. - Sure about what? What is all this about? - Do you recognize this man? - Yes, it's Gregory Barnes. His wife hired Jack to find out if he was cheating. I had dinner with him. He claims she was in a coma. - [Tape recording - Denise]: I love skiing, I wish I could go with you to Aspen. - [Male voice]: I don't think my wife would appreciate that. - We wouldn't have to tell her. - Sorry, I'm happily married. If I want to take someone skiing, it'll be my wife. Now, if you have a problem with this, maybe we should end this lunch. [ Click ] - That wasn't me. That was Denise. - We know that. But that's the tape his wife got. Jack met with Gregory Barnes a day after your dinner. He played him the original tape. He threatened to give his wife a copy unless he paid him 5 grand to stage this new one. It turns out Barnes's wife ended up leaving him anyway, so he's thinking he shelled out a whole lot of cash for nothing. So he called us. - So you're saying that Jack's a blackmailer? - Uh-huh, probably a murderer. Denise Sandler had her own scam going. She went to Jack's clients and threatened to tell their husbands about the decoys unless they paid off: real nickel and dime stuff. She gets nailed and cuts a deal to testify against Jack. She turns up dead. We also had Parker by the short and curlies -- some old beef that could have cost him his license. He agrees to testify, he turns up dead. That leaves you. You're the only one left who can prove a new tape was made. That knife, it was meant for you. - No, not Jack. - Come on, times were tough. He had 3 alimony payments, ran up some pretty big debts. People do stupid things when they're desperate. - Jack would never do that. He's always been there for me. - You're best friend is in the hospital. The killer is still out there. We need your testimony. Ms. Greer. - No. - If you don't cooperate, we can't protect you. Do you want to die? - I need some time to think. - All right, all right. Why don't you take some time, get your head around it, and call us. We only want to help. In the meantime, be careful. - Erin, we have to talk. Erin! Erin! Erin! Erin! Son of a bitch. - Detective Costello please. Tell him Erin Greer is calling. - [Receptionist]: I'm sorry, he's not at his desk. He should be back very soon. - Okay, he can reach me on my cell. - I'll tell him. - Hi. Look Max, before you say anything, just let me explain. I know that I've been acting strange lately. It's just that I've been so scared and I just found out that Jack is actually-- - Shh. I don't care. All that matters is that you're here now. You have to realize that I would never do anything to hurt you. [ Phone ringing ] - Hello. - Erin, where are you? - No. First, we make a deal. Okay look, I want to help you but first, first, we've got to talk to Jack. I want to hear his side. - Jack turned himself in half an hour ago. - He what? - Look Erin, we were wrong. He admitted to the blackmail, but he swears he never killed anybody. He was concerned for your safety. That's why he turned himself in-- - Give me the phone. Erin, it's me. Where are you? - Jack, what's going on? - Where are you? - At Max's loft. Why? - Get dressed. - Why? What is going on? - Erin, think. What's the address? - 335 Pine. - 335 Pine. Get somebody over there now. Erin, get out of there. You're in danger. - No, no you're wrong. - Erin, get out of there right now. This guy is going to kill you. You get out of there right now. - [Max]: Hey Erin, you're hungry? How about some eggs? Hey Erin, Erin? Erin, what are you doing? Erin! Wait! Erin! Wait! Ah! - Leave me alone! - Erin! Erin! Erin! Come on, Erin. Erin, I don't know what's gotten into you. I just want to talk. Tell me what happened. Erin, this is crazy. Erin, wait! Don't sell me out! Erin! Erin, why are you hiding? I'm not going to hurt you. This is a big misunderstanding. Can we just talk about it? This is getting ridiculous. Erin! Erin, are you hurt? Come on, speak to me. Ow! What are you doing? Erin. Erin! Erin. - Don't you come near me, Max! - Erin, don't. - I know all about you, Max. You killed Denise, you killed Parker, you tried to kill me. - That's not true. - Last night you said you were here, but you weren't. I called you back. - I was downstairs waiting for my lawyer. - Stop lying! - No, we went to dinner, we discussed the divorce. I told him I didn't care about the money. I just want to be with you. Please! Put down the gun. [ Door shutting above ] - Help! Help me! Over here. - You can justify anything here, but not here. - Stay back, stay back. - Look at me. What do you feel? - No. - I love you. - Stay back. - Do what you have to. - Ah! - I didn't have a choice. She was going to kill you. It's okay. - Yeah, you're kidding. - [Julie]: No, I'm not. So what about Jack? - Jack took the plea bargain. He's going to get six months. - Hey, I've got to go. My doctor just walked in. - You are so crazy. - I can't help it. - I love you. - Me too. - See you first thing in the morning, okay? - Okay. Bye. - All right, bye. - How's Julie doing? - She's great. She got asked out by 2 doctors. She said if she knew that, she would have gotten stabbed months ago. What? - I just... if it wasn't for me, Denise, Julie. - Hey, Denise brought this on herself. She was blackmailing Dina. They found the cancelled cheques. - What about Parker? She killed him to frame me, to keep us apart. If I'd just made a clean break, I... - Max, she was sick. Stop beating yourself up over this, okay? Thank you for not giving up on me. - Thank you for not shooting me. - How did you know I wouldn't? - I didn't. I just knew that if we couldn't be together, I didn't care. Why didn't you shoot me? It couldn't have been trust, could it? - Maybe. Well, when I was pointing the gun at you... I don't know, it didn't feel real. I mean, it felt like I was playing a part, like when I was decoying. And I looked at you, I really, really looked at you. I guess I saw the light in the shadows of the shadows. Now, kiss me. Ow! My leg. - My leg. - Ow, my leg! - Ow, my leg! [ Laughters ]
