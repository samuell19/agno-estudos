[RAHAYU] Did you only order one bag? It should be two bags. - But there's only one. - How many items are there in the bag? I counted ten. Do you want me to bring them all? You can start putting the things in boxes right now, so that Ms. Husni doesn't have to wait and can pick them up easily tomorrow. Alright. One more thing, please wrap the remaining stock. They were ordered for Mr. Cholil's Quran school graduates. Okay, ma'am. Wow, you've got so many customers! Umrah plans for this year seem promising for you. How long will you be away? I'm not sure. It might take a week or so. Alright, I'll leave now. Take good care of this shop. Okay? Just ignore her. Thank you. - Take care, ma'am. - Okay. I see you have a complete package, a dedicated shopkeeper and a lucky charm to boost your sales. Excuse me. Another one for Ms. Endang. It's okay, I got this. Where do you want it? Over there?

She could even go to college. - [RAHAYU] I'm home. - Welcome back. Look, I've brought you this month's harvest. And here's some money for you. Thank you. Aji, I brought you a toy. Do you like it? You shouldn't buy toys for your little brother too often. It may spoil him. Teach him how to take care of himself. Aji, shall we go upstairs? Let's go. Let's go upstairs.

I love her as much as if she were. [MAN] Look... before he died, your late husband told me to sell this place. You do know about your husband's past, right? Things went south after he died.

I don't want Rahayu to be near those spirits! [SENTOT] We have to stop it... before it's too late. But you have to clean yourself up. What do you mean? You must stop living this way. You've been possessed by a spirit. A jinn! Now you see the consequences. Please cure Ayu. Save her. Then I will do anything you want.

Right? - [CROWD] Yes, she is! - [CROWD CLAMORING] I know that your late husband was a shaman. He acted as if he were a holy man by donating a prayer room. But it turned out that he did that with black magic. What do you want now? Do you want to murder my daughter? You want to cast a spell on my daughter? - [GASPS] Please calm down. - [WOMAN] There she is! - The daughter of that shaman! - [CROWD MURMURING] [WOMAN] At first, we were glad that you left. But now that you're back, you're bringing bad luck with you! What do you want? Tell me! [SURATMAN] Calm down! Everyone, please calm down. I saw what happened. Even if she was possessed, it wasn't her fault. Hey, punk. Don't act like you know everything. You're still new here. You have no idea what kind of person her father was. Rahayu, don't say anything... I do apologize. I had no intention to hurt anyone... including Riri. Let's just go home, mom. I have a bad feeling about this. - Come on. - Do you accept my apology? Come on, Mom. I'm fine, really. You devil's child! You better watch yourself here. Because we already know that your father was beheaded because he was a sorcerer! - Enough! - Sorcerer! - You understand? - That's enough. - Understand, huh? - [CROWD JEERING] I'm so sorry, everyone. [JEERING CONTINUES] That's enough, Ayu. No more trouble, okay? Ayu... Why did those people get mad at Mom? They didn't get mad at Mom. She's alright. Now, it's time to sleep. Why did you have to cause such a commotion? You were the one who asked to live here. If this keeps up, then we... I was born and raised here. This is all that my father left behind. Then please do me a favor. Act normally. Stop creating any more trouble. I've done everything you wanted. So please... do this family a favor, so we can live... peacefully. Sentot has told us... - that... - We can move in with him. So that he can take over my father's money. What did you say? Sentot has been manipulating you. He married off my father to you after my mother died. My real mother. And now my father's no longer here. So it's easier for him now to take over father's wealth. [ENDING PRAYER] Praise be to Allah. Ayu? Don't worry. There's nothing here. Um... Do you want me to stay? No. I'm good. You can go. Okay. [RECITING PRAYER IN ARABIC] [OBJECTS CLATTERING] [OMINOUS MUSIC PLAYING] [EERIE MUSIC PLAYING] [DEMON GROWLING] [SCREAMING IN PANIC] [PANTING] [SCREAMS] [SCREAMING] [PANTING] Ayu? Did they show up again? "They"? Who are "they"? You recklessly summoned them. You can't stop them now that they're here. I was the one who summoned them? [SARWO] Yes. [SURATMAN] You were praying... and you were disturbed. I did recite Taawuz, because I was told to. [SARWO] And spit three times to the left? Then what will you say if it turns out that you really did call them? What do you mean by "they"? Your childhood friends. What do you mean? That house, the prayer room, this town, those places made you the way you are today. Your father was a good person, and so are you. [SARWO] Sentot, your stepmother, your father's tragic demise, and you returning to this town... It has compelled you to confront your own truth. Ayu, you're not an ordinary person. That's why Sentot and your father performed exorcism on you. But it wasn't finished yet. You saw for yourself that you could summon them... even when you didn't know it. They were waiting for you. They were the ones who went to the prayer room to see you. [SOFT MUSIC PLAYING] [EERIE SOUND EFFECTS] [SIGHS] [SIGHS] [EERIE MUSIC PLAYING] [WOMAN] Just 5000 rupiahs for two bags.

Here you go. - Thank you. - You're welcome. Like daughter, like mother. You both sure are using a charm. You don't care about us here at all. You might as well just take all the money from the buyers in this market! Take them, all you want! That makes you happy, right? You and your daughter really are amazing. What? Why don't you say something? Don't act like you're so holy. You and your evil family! I'm sick of you all! [SNAKE RATTLING] [HISSING] [RATTLING CONTINUES] [PANTING IN PAIN] Ouch! My leg!

What's going on here? A lot of people have been hurt since that woman came here. That's true. So? Don't act like you have no idea. It was Semedi's wife who had been putting a spell on them. I have to go out there. - No, don't! - No, sis. [NUNING] Don't go! [SARWO] Watch your tongue! Last time, Rahayu strangled Minah's daughter. Help! And now Minah is being harmed. How is Minah being harmed? Her legs are festering due to the spell cast by Semedi's wife. [PANTING IN PAIN] My leg! [NUNING] Oh my god! [CROWD] It's true! Don't you dare mention the dead. Understand? His wife and daughter came here to make a living. You shouldn't bother them! Don't act like you're all perfect. I'm well aware that some of you have evil spirits working for you. - [OMINOUS SOUND EFFECTS] - [DOOR CREAKING] If something bad happens... you will be the one to blame. Fine. Alright. Now leave! - [CROWD JEERING] - Stop harassing a widow and her kids. [EERIE MUSIC PLAYING] [HISSING] [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] [HISSING CONTINUES] [WOMAN SIGHING] [SUFFOCATING] Mother? [SORROW MUSIC PLAYING] [WAILING] Mother! [CRYING HYSTERICALLY] [CROWD CHATTERING] [MAN] Calm down. You're fortunate that I managed to calm them down. If it hadn't been for me, your family would've been in grave danger. My husband wasn't a sorcerer. He helped other people in his own way. [WOMAN] "Helped other people"? Stop blabbering nonsense. Ms. Minah died in a tragic way. Her legs were rotting overnight. Is that what "helping other people" means to you? [SCOFFS] Even if it were true that Semedi was a sorcerer, he has already passed away. And there's no way Nuning and Rahayu could cause any harm to Riri and Minah. We might have let you defend them before, but now you can see that the people want justice. [CROWD] Yes, we do! What are you going to do? You're going to behead them too, huh? First, they need to acknowledge their wrongdoing. And then we can determine an appropriate punishment for them. No. We won't admit to things we didn't do. Why do you keep bothering our family? Leave my property. I said leave! - Hey. - Go away! - [SURATMAN] Calm down, Ayu. - [NUNING] Ayu! [WOMAN] See? Daughter of a witch. [SARWO] You can't make someone say they did something they didn't do. And you can't tell the police because you don't have strong evidence. So what are you going to do now? What kind of answer can you give? Please tell us. - Yeah, we need an answer. - [CROWD AGREEING] God is the only one who knows if you are using black magic or not. You'll have to swear and look God in the eye. Uh, what do you mean? You're going to perform a Pocong Oath. - [GASPS] - [CROWD MURMURING] I will do that. I'm going to show you that we're innocent. - Ayu. - [MAN] No! She's not going to perform the oath... but this woman will. Minah died because someone was using black magic. Before she died, she was arguing with this woman. So, if someone used black magic on her, it must have been this woman. - [WOMAN] Yeah! - [CROWD AGREEING] And if she still won't say it, let her die while she's taking her oath. I will take the oath instead of her. So I can die and see my father again. Stop it, Ayu! Do not say a word! Come here, baby. [CRYING SOFTLY] Don't do that. [SARWO] There is no other way. If Nuning agrees to take the oath and remains alive thereafter... I want all of you... to stop bothering them. Okay? This time, I agree with your idea. Let's go. Bye! [SOBBING] [SOFT MUSIC PLAYING] [SOBBING CONTINUES] [SOFT MUSIC CONTINUES] [ENGINE RUNNING] [SENTOT] These shophouses need to be cleansed, and Rahayu needs to be exorcised again. [SARWO] Are you saying you'll be the one to perform the exorcism? Just like what you did to her when she was young? Look, Sarwo. Back then, Semedi was given this shophouse as a gift, for curing a conglomerate from the effects of witchcraft cast by their enemy. Unfortunately... Semedi used the help of spirits to support the healing process. You should have been to blame because you were the one who got him interested in the occult. [SCOFFS] Don't act so righteous in front of me as if you think I'm going down the wrong path. I know that I don't pray the same way you do, but I also have a God, just like you do. What we need now isn't a Pocong Oath. People need proof, and the Pocong Oath is the answer. You're just making things worse. Maybe you are the real reason Rahayu is having so much trouble. And now you're taking over her father's wealth. Sarwo! He left it with me, - and I didn't rob him. - [CHUCKLES] Rahayu never believed you. And is your reason for doing the exorcism as good as you say it is? [OMINOUS MUSIC PLAYING] MOSQUE OF JETIS [SOMBER MUSIC PLAYING] Ayu, where are you going? [SOMBER MUSIC CONTINUES] AL-MAKMUM PRAYER ROOM [OMINOUS SOUND EFFECTS] [FOREBODING MUSIC PLAYING] [SARWO] Repeat after me.

[CROWD JEERING] [SIGHING HEAVILY] [PENSIVE MUSIC PLAYING] Why are you messing with your food? Are you finished? Yeah. Oh, hi, Ayu. Make a bowl for me. I have to go. - Here's the money. - Oh, right. - Thanks. - [SURATMAN] Ayu. I heard that you're leaving. Who told you that? Uh, people at the market told me. They said someone is going to buy your shophouse very soon. That's just rumors. [PENSIVE MUSIC PLAYING] [NUNING] These shophouses were donated to my late husband in 1992. [BUYER] What is the land area? It's approximately 5382 square feet for four shophouses. [BUYER] Okay, it's 5382 square feet. We'll measure it again just to be sure. - Can you do that for me? - [MAN] Sure. [NUNING] Okay. Do you have all the necessary and full paperwork for the land? Yes, of course. Okay, thank you for your time. We'll see you soon. - [NUNING] Thank you. - You're welcome. You're home, already? At this hour? Do you want something to eat? Those people are Sentot's men, aren't they? They are, aren't they? Look... Your father did leave Sentot some lands that he planned to sell. - And now... - And now... he will take full control of everything. Ayu... please stop being biased. He helped your father find repentance. "Repentance"? So you now agree with him that my father was so bad that he had to repent? Your father used to engage in connections with black magic from another realm. I knew that even before we got married. And as it turned out, everything he did came with a price. What do you mean? During the Pocong Oath ceremony yesterday, the evil spirits that granted him power, supernatural protection, pesugihan, spells... They were all pursuing me. Then how are you still alive? I saw you there. You were among them. [SIGHS] Ayu, we need to break away from them. Or else, the devils who have us under their control will... Sentot's desire to take over my father's money is the real devil. [TENSE MUSIC PLAYING] Ayu... Your uncle, who always tries to look holy, is the real devil. He's trying to take control of my father's wealth. That night, he was the one who planned the murder. He was the one who murdered my father. [RAHAYU] On the day we were kicked out from our home by the community... there was one person among them who had a wound on his face. I was the one who caused that wound. Those people were the ones who killed my father. And Sentot knew them. They were conspiring. All of that wealth belongs to my father, and he paid his dues... by having his head severed like an animal! So you should really stop believing in how holy Sentot is because it's all fake. Or your fate will end up like... my real mother! - [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] - [SCREAMING] - [GASPS] - [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC CONTINUES] [FOREBODING MUSIC PLAYING] Ms. Endang... I'm sorry that I... I overslept. - Ayu. - Yes, ma'am? This is for you. What is this for? You don't need to come to work tomorrow. - What do you mean? - You're fired. - I know I made a mistake, but... - That's enough.

Finally, you all managed to get me here. Are they going to do an exorcism on me like they did back then? Sentot always saw your father as if he were his own son. So he won't do you harm. He's been targeting my father's money for quite some time. Sentot is a rich man. He's rich in both material possessions and compassion. He built this boarding school and other facilities for the people. Everyone can stay and study here for free. So he doesn't need your father's money. [SOFT MUSIC PLAYING] Right, just lie down and take it easy. My mother... and Aji... Are they no longer with us? [EXHALING IN SHOCK] [HEART WRENCHING MUSIC PLAYING] [SOBBING] [WOMAN] You have to gain Rahayu's trust... to really save her, Sentot.

[SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] [SENTOT'S WIFE] You didn't kill them. You're not a murderer, remember that. You have no idea what those snakes are. They were coming out of me. Those snakes do not belong in this world. It was beyond your control. Those spirits have been manipulating you. How do you know? You're not alone. I was just like you when I was younger. I was very sensitive... and I couldn't control my own power. It took a lot of victims... including my own family. Sentot helped me and guided me. [SENTOT'S WIFE] These evil spirits feed on grudges and remorse. And they're comfortable to stay in your body. They must get out of your body. We need to completely cleanse them. [SOBS] [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC CONTINUES] [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING] It's unusual. No greetings? That's unheard of. You don't deserve a greeting from me, you bastard. I found it. You scum! Give it back to me! Give it back! Stay away from Rahayu, my child, and all of my students. [GROANS] [GRUNTS] [SENTOT RECITING PRAYER] Rahayu, the daughter of Semedi... with the grace and power of Allah... you will undergo a purification process to rid yourself of any evils that may reside within you. Are you willing to let it go? [OMINOUS MUSIC PLAYING] [INTRUDER SCREAMING] [OMINOUS MUSIC CONTINUES] [SENTOT] Rahayu, the daughter of Semedi... with the grace and power of Allah... you will undergo a purification process to rid yourself of any evil that may reside within you. Are you willing to let them go? I'm... not willing to let them go. - [TENSE MUSIC PLAYING] - You bastard! [GROANS] Die you! Die! [TENSE MUSIC CONTINUES] [RAHAYU SCREAMING] [SILENCE] [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING] [WIND BLOWING] [TERRIFYING MUSIC] [SENTOT] Ayu! I am Sentot, your grandfather! I'm not here to harm you. I want to save you. [IN DEMON VOICE] I know you murdered my father. No, it wasn't me. I swear! But you know who murdered him. He's taken away everything I had! Including all my patients. He's getting even richer! You've taken away everything I had. Now, I will take your daughter away from you. [CACKLES] Do you know how powerful his daughter is? She will assist me in attaining both glory and wealth! So you are the one who's been targeting Rahayu's wealth? If you want to inherit all my abilities... you have to steal the snake cane from my perverted student. [GRUNTING] [TENSE MUSIC PLAYING] It was my son who did it, your uncle! Uncle, my foot. He was used by Sarwo! Husni. Get rid of Semedi. Don't let Wahid know, okay? - [TENSE MUSIC PLAYING] - Rahayu! Let go of my daughter! [BLOOD SPURTING] [SOBBING] I'm sorry, Father. I really didn't know that Sarwo asked Husni to kill Semedi. Curses on all of you and everything you've done. You're hiding other people's sins. Isn't that also a sin? We are all sinners... - [BONE CRACKS] - ...who seeks forgiveness from Allah. [RAHAYU] But you... will never get my forgiveness! [GRUNTS] [SENTOT GROANING] Wahid! Wahid, stop it! - [SENTOT'S WIFE] That's your father! - [SENTOT] Wahid! [SENTOT'S WIVE] Wahid! Stop, Wahid! Get a grip, Wahid! - Open your eyes! - [SOBBING IN DISBELIEF] Seek forgiveness, son! [SOBS] Please forgive me, Father. I deserve to die! Seek forgiveness! I deserve to die! Seek forgiveness, Wahid! - [BLOOD SPURTING] - [SENTOT'S WIFE IN SCREAM] Wahid! [WAILING] Sentot! - Sentot! - They deserved to die. We have no right to decide who should die, Ayu. - [SOBS] - Yeah, but they got to decide... if my father would live or die. [ANGRILY] Now what do you want to say? [WIND BLOWING] [CHANTING PRAYER IN ARABIC] [RAHAYU SCREAMING IN PAIN] [CHANTING CONTINUES] [RAHAYU GROWLING] [CHANTING FADES AWAY] [SOOTHING MUSIC PLAYING] [INAUDIBLE DIALOGUE] [SOOTHING MUSIC CONTINUES] [SENTOT'S WIFE] Khanzab is an evil spirit who disturbs people during prayer. However, the one who approaches you isn't just Khanzab. It's actually darker beings that used Khanzab as a way to take full control of your body. And these beings... have an evil side that is in every person. But can you really expel them? Or can you control them? [SENTOT'S WIFE] I surrender myself to Allah. The ruler of heaven and earth. Devils live in our hearts where we feel revenge and anger. You have to be able to let go of these feelings, including your anger at Sarwo and everyone else who has hurt you. The key lies in one thing, you must decide for yourself... how you will utilize the ability that Allah has bestowed upon you. [RAHAYU] Ratman? Rahayu. Are you feeling better now? Yeah. Thankfully. - Then, see you again. - Take care. So you're here? Yeah. I grew up here. Mr. Heri called and asked me to help out around this place, since Mr. Sentot had died. Ayu... I'm sorry for your loss. [SOFT MUSIC PLAYING] "So establish prayer, pay alms-tax, and hold fast to Allah. He alone is your Guardian. What an excellent Guardian, and what an excellent Helper."
