The train coming from Milan is arriving at Platform 3. The train coming from Milan is arriving at Platform 3. Peppino! Get on, the train's leaving. Behave yourself, alright? Just like I taught you. - Inspector Mauri? - That's me. Marshal Capece, at your service. - Marshal? - Modestly speaking. - Please, give me your suitcase. - No, thanks. Walk slowly. Hello, Luisa. Welcome. Won't you give me a kiss? Say "good morning". "Good morning". Good morning. - Hi, Luisa. - Hi. You've grown in eight months of boarding school. - How are you? - Fine, daddy. May I take these flowers to Mom? Sure, dear. Right away. Go, Ruggero. let's go. This way, sir. On this side. Make yourself comfortable, sir. What a body! Holy Mary! On the tourist guide, this one has two stars. Sure. Of course. Let's go. Bye, Mom. I'll be back soon. - Good morning, Marshal. - Morning. This way. Come in! - Sir, Inspector Mauri is here. - Let him in. - Come in, Inspector. - Thank you. - Welcome to Naples, Mauri. How are you? - Good morning, sir. I finally managed to get you here. Please sit down. Thanks. The pleasure is all mine, and I hope that my experience in Milan is useful to you. You will like it here with us. I have picked as your assistant a great officer: Marshal Nicola Capece, known as "the Fox of Forcella". Thanks. Very kind of you. He will provide you with all the information on the crime situation, which is no worse than in Milan. Here there is no fog and smoke, we have the joy of the sun and the loveliest sea in the world. And the biggest scoundrels in the world navigate on it. Pieces of shit! Go on. Sir, Attorney Cerullo and Mr. Bonino would like to see you. What the hell happened? Andronico found three dead bodies at the appointment. The drug is gone. Was the deal with the suppliers the same as always? Yes, sir, as usual. Then listen carefully, all of you. You take the harbor, you take the stadium, and you, with your sluts. Attorney, spread the word that we need merchandise. Heavy drugs, as we expected. A two million dollar deal can only be made among wholesalers. But let everyone know that Laurenzi won't be made a fool of by anyone! And in case you get any ideas, this goes for you too. You can go. Andronico doesn't convince me. He's got a safe-deposit box in a bank outside our circle. Banco di Sconto. I want to know what he's hiding and why he opened a safe at Banco di Sconto. - You must take care of it tonight. - It's not possible. A burglary, before Sunday, cannot be organized. Bonino, I can't waste time. You need to do it by Sunday, got it? - Let's pinpoint the situation. - Yes. I want the names and addresses of this city's bosses. You want to know where they live? We are in Naples, not in Milan. There are bosses here, but they are like magic tricks. They are here, but can't be seen. What can I say? Here, look at him. We saw him at the station. You didn't notice. When you arrived, he was waiting for his child, the little girl he adopted. So he also does good deeds? No, he's a scoundrel. Seems he killed the mother and the daughter is hers. This is his lover, another slut. - And the others? - They're all here. Andronico, Sheikh... These are his guardian angels, Sheikh and Garrese. Look how handsome they are, gentlemen faces! This is a photo of someone with a clean record. This one? He's the attorney of these delinquents. If we could make him talk, we would know a lot of things. "Ifs" have never won a war. I would win it with this. Come in! May I come in? Good morning, Inspector. I brought the mail. Sir. - The mail. May I sit down? - Please do. May I? Let's see what news there is today. Something new every day here. Let's see what it says. This is the usual cuckold blaming his wife's lover for everything. Cheating is always in fashion. This is the usual... Here it is. A warning that they will shoot the chief police. For 30 years they've threatened this, but they never do it. Why bother writing it? Let's see this. "Banco di Sconto. Sunday." Three puppets... Sir, I don't understand. Look. How many branches are there in Naples? Are you kidding? You want to bother with what people say? Sunday... There will be no robberies. Napoli is playing a home game. - Tell me how many branches. - I'm trying to remember. Only one. It opened a couple of months ago. It's a northern bank. They're polenta-eaters like you. We may be polenta-eaters, but when I ask questions, I just want the answers without any comments! Alright, sir. I understand. As you wish. We are in the 20th minute of the first half. The result, for those who just tuned in, is the following: Napoli 1, Juventus 0. The ball passes from Orlandini to Juliano, then a long pass to Savoldi, who passes it to Esposito, who runs down the sideline, and unfortunately... Obviously, his shirt is pulled... Jerk! He's a real jerk. It's crazy. - Excuse me, sir! - Didn't you go to the stadium? Napoli is winning. I'm not going to watch the polenta-eaters lose. Excuse me, sir. Jackass! They always take it out on us. SEPTEMBER 8 - SUNDAY - 15:07 - Here it is. - Pull. - Fantastic! - These are worth a lot. Cool off a little. Here, you drink too. This is what we needed. - And with this, the job is done. - Done? Done! A Fernet Branca, please. Where is the service entrance of the bank? - Shit! - Goal! What a great goal! What? Napoli wins and he's pissed off? It's crazy. - Inspector, get in! - Go, follow them! They can't get away, don't worry. They call me Nicola "Lauda". There they are. I told you. There's a car following us! Faster! They've almost caught up! Shoot at them! Faster! Go! Quick! Not bad! Naples is a city to be discovered, like a virgin. This isn't the time to think about sex. Think about not losing them. I'm good, but with this car even coffee would suck. Faster, you jackass! Faster! Faster! Go! Go! We'll never catch them. Use your brain. I don't know what you have in mind, but if you've got balls, this is the time to show them. It's nice to work with an inspector who's a little gay. We made it! They can't screw Dogheart. Where did they come from? - My good luck token works. - The northerner is superstitious! Run! Easy for you to say! They went that way. This way. Not bad, Inspector. I hope the Napoli players are fitter. Let's hope so! I'm out of breath! - Don't shoot, we're coming out! - Please stop! The poor guy you shot said "please stop" too. I know you. I remember your ugly face. You're Minelli. He was a Narcotics client before you came... Down! What a lovely Sunday! Really lovely! This trip was a waste of time. The goods haven't been shipped yet, but we already paid. The boxes of Madame Carola's clothes filled with the stuff haven't left yet. Why? Someone tried to rip me off and now I know who he is. If you know who screwed you, when are you getting the goods back? We were lucky that the scum betrayed himself. Yes, it's always good to cleanse the environment. - When will you deliver the goods? - Give me a week. Andronico... If he didn't steal the stuff, he knows who did. Bonino, Andronico must talk, the easy way or the hard one. You must have someone who can make him sing. Sure. I have the right person for the job. Who is he? Dogheart. He recovered the file in the safety deposit box. Dogheart has killed three already. His name says a lot about him. Anyway, the goods must be delivered within a week. At the latest. Three dead bodies here, three dead bodies there... Not to mention that strange robbery at Banco di Sconto. According to forensics, they knew what they were looking for. They just wanted some files. They only opened a few safety boxes when they could've taken them all. What were they looking for? Here's a list of the owners whose boxes were raided. - Thanks, I have a copy. - Good. Fine, then that's it for now. You can go. As soon as you have news, update me immediately. And above all, be extremely careful. Speaking of news, the same tip of the bank showed up again. - It's a heart with a dog. - Is this a puzzle? - Garrese. - What do you want? What do you want? Are you crazy? - Where is the drug? - I don't know. I swear I don't know. I only put a hole in your thigh. Want to become Swiss cheese? It's in the mushroom farm. I knew you were that scum. What do you want to do? These are the last ones. Marullo sends them with his greetings and a fuck off. Courtesy among inspectors. - We'll pass it on. - I'll tell him. Nicola, the situation has become a little clearer. On Friday morning, we find three bodies on the sea shore. Sea pollution. On Sunday they steal something special from the bank and then they organize a performance. And we found out that the safety box belongs to Gennaro Andronico. Let's move on. Yesterday they killed Andronico and Garrese in the stadium office. Sheikh is missing, Andronico's man. Either he killed them or he dodged a settling of accounts organized by Laurenzi, Bonino's partner. The Chief has been after him forever, but can't touch Don Mimi. - He's a big fish! - So we have to find Sheikh. Maybe I know where to find him. Leave it to me. Antonio Esposito, known as Sheikh. There he is. He started very early, and as a delinquent had a very fast career. At 14, he was a client of the Narcotics Squad. Arrested several times for petty thefts or involved in sleazy slut business, he always got away with little. Every time, his attorney Cerullo got him out of jail. Alright. You said number three. - Yes. - Good, I'll take care of him. Follow her. She surely knows something. Keep your eyes open. Bye. Who are you? What do you want? If I ask a question, answer it. Otherwise shut up and don't try to trick me. Is that clear? You're a real jerk! Where were you when they killed Andronico? - Did Dogheart send you? - You said it. I'm after him. Where is he? Last time I saw him was at the stadium. - What's his real name? - Pasquale Donnaregina. I don't know anything else. Nicola would give her four stars. Who is she? - A friend. - I know. She gives you money too. - What's her name? - Rosa. Hello? This is Inspector Mauri. Send me two from Narcotics. I have a client for you behind the Pellegrini Hospital. Fine. Thanks. You'll get by with little with the Narcotics people. Only the two of us will talk about Dogheart. Tell me everything or you're done. Sorry. - What an ass! - You're looking at women? - Fag! - Me? Gosh! - Rosa, you're lovelier every day. - Stop it. - Is he inside? - Yes, I'll take you. Good morning. Would you come with me? - Good morning, attorney. - Don Domenico. It's hard to find you. With Andronico's death, I had a lot to do in settling affairs with the widow. Tell me, Don Domenico, did you find the goods? Maybe. That's why I'm here. To find out if affairs of the departed included the goods. The poor man did nothing without consulting you first. I didn't hide anything from you. The goods must leave by next Sunday. Get busy with your clients to find out who wants to screw us. - It's interesting. - Don Domenico, I came to tell you that Sheikh was arrested by Inspector Mauri. - Who is that? - A new one. He recently arrived in Naples. He seems to like sticking his nose everywhere, especially in our business. Did he have to arrest Sheikh of all people? He's a junkie, and if he is without drugs, he will say anything to get it. Bonino, take care of Sheikh. And you, my lawyer friend, take care of our business. Naples is a beautiful city and it's worth living in it. You must let me go! I'm innocent! Shut up! The deputy D.A. will talk to all of you. You'll tell your bullshit to him. - I've been like this for three hours! - Relax. I'll take you for a ride. Get in, quick, come on! Go on! - What are you doing here? - We have the crates for the canteen. You must go to the other side. General, they told me to unload the crates here. Wait, I'll ask the sergeant. - Give me a light. - Come on! Move! Dogheart sends his regards. You too. Alarm! Only Sheikh was missing. I should have imagined it. Killing Andronico, Garrese, Sheikh... Only Laurenzi would give such an order. - You're getting smart. - The master makes a good dog. But knowing things is not enough. You must prove them. Not everyone has our intelligence. - Here it is. This is the villa. - Wow! - He treats himself well. - It's one of many. Don Domenico has more villas than fleas. You know a lot. The only thing I don't know is why I do everything you want. Look at me! With this on, I'm ridiculous. - Because you're in love with me. - What are you saying? You speak. You know the local language. - Who is it? - Phone company. Yes, I'll open immediately. Let's go. I played it well. They believed it right away. I have a "telephone" voice. They weren't suspicions because they were expecting us. They were expecting us? To make things easier, I sent a notice where I explained that two maintenance workers would arrive. What a sly fox! You're a relative of Rommel. - Come on, hurry up. - Always running in a rush! Good morning. Here we are. Keep him still. I'll take care of it. Come on, dude. Give me your hand, so I'll block it and you'll stay calm and won't move. The other hand... Here you are. Good, well done. Here you are. Here you are. Now put your legs together. You're always standing and you get tired. This way both can rest. Alright. Your mouth... Your eyes, yes. That's it, there. Guess who I am? - Wow! They treat themselves well. - They're gentlemen. - Work. I'm taking a look around. - Alright. People from Milan always work. - Good! Are you comfortable? - Did you find anything? Something interesting. Someone in this house likes to draw. The little girl. Jesus! And I only found this. Look at this. - Nicola. - What? You really are incredible. Modestly speaking, you noticed too. What is that? - Maybe a life sentence. - In there? Be strong. Be brave, come on. Andronico. First they kill him and then they bury him. Who soils must clean. Don't take him away from me! Laurenzi's little girl. Leave it to me. I'll help you. This is my mother. She sleeps here. Luisa! Luisa! My name is Dario. You draw very well. - I receive your drawings. - Luisa! I have to go. Bye, Dario. If you want to talk to me, call me on 666. When I call you, you must come! Understand? Yesterday morning, two armed scums entered my house. They turned the villa inside out. - What were they looking for? - Maybe me. But they only stole the agenda. Who could need it? Nobody could understand a thing from there. You are wrong, there is someone. - Attorney... - Don Domenico. Any news on the stuff? No, but we're looking for Rosa, Sheikh's girlfriend. She's missing and I think she knows something. She could be a good lead. - You have to act quickly, Bonino. - It will be done. I caught you! You all know where to find me, I always work at the Tahiti. The Tahiti! You only went there to get the money. Not to work! - What do you want? - I want to be with you for a while. What do you want? Let me go! No, I don't want to! No! Let me go! No! Go away! I didn't do anything! - No! - Come here. Let me go! Help! No! Stop, you pigs! - No! Help! - Stop! Help! He'll kill me! - Stop! - No! - Hold her still! - No! Stop! This is a beautiful woman. I'd give her four stars. - I could have sworn it. - He got angry as usual? No, he said that our squad has become the Death Squad. Not a Special Squad. They also called from Rome to know about this. From Rome? From the Ministry? We've become important. Maybe too much! They want less commotion around us. Hello? This is Inspector Mauri. What is it? Tell me. I'm a friend who can read agendas. I would like to meet and discuss terms. - Are you in a position to decide? - Yes. It's urgent, but no funny business. So when and where. I will be in an area on the outskirts of Naples. Take Porta Capuana and reach the beltway. One moment... The beltway. - Then turn left. - To the left... - Continue for two kilometers. - Two kilometers... Then you'll find a lane that coasts the Cumana railway. Yes. I will be there at 10. - What number? - 180. You must come alone. - I was born a loner. - Fine. Something is moving. Fear makes mice dance. Can we trust him? He's the only scum willing to teach me to read. - Really? - You take care of the girl. The girl? I can take care of her, sure. Inspector Mauri, follow me. Wait a moment. Inspector, thank you for coming. It's you, the attorney! What a surprise! You are very famous. Famous? In Naples, "attorney" is not an important title. I was not referring to Naples, I meant this agenda. Your name is on five pages out of ten in here. Sure, my name. You can't decipher anything else. In fact, I'm here for your consultancy as an expert in local folklore. Every consultation has its price. In this case, what do I get from it? Simply your hide. Yes, but... When I reveal to you what is hidden in this agenda, you'll be in possession of very important information, and I will be obliged to go very far from here as soon as possible. And it's expensive to travel. See? This trip didn't cost you a thing. Don't move! Your running is over. - Oh, sorry! - Let's go to my place. - Yes, where is the car? - Back there. Were you looking for me? Do you really prefer me to younger men? You are a gentleman. You have salt-and-pepper hair. But I have a big nose. Yes, but it gives you character. - Okay, madam? - Yes. I'll leave the bottle. - What would you like? - A steaming hot chocolate. This is a nightclub. No hot drinks are served here. Then a Sacco mint with no ice. Mint? - What's wrong with mint? - Those who drink it. What do you think of her? With all the women in the world, you waste time in this way? Never saw her. Your eyes must be in your ass. Who is she? So? Many women come here. I'll try to track her down. - Do you have dollars? - Yes! Then you are very handsome. Hello? It's Giorgio from Tahiti. There is a customer for Susy. Alright. I managed to find her. The address is Vicolo Sant'Anna 34. See? You knew her. You're a good guy. Bye. Did you have to cross my path now? Damn! My arm! It's an order from the police. The papers say we shoot in the middle of a crowd. Forget it. I didn't think I would solve the cost of living with this. But with a weapon like this, when any of our dear friends shoots at you, we might as well say "boom". You get the same result. Hey! Are you already back? I can't stay in prison or in a hospital. Or away from you! Did you miss me or the chief of police? Are you jealous? - I was going to visit you. - Chocolates? Thank you! You have to die for people to be kind. It wouldn't have just been a courtesy visit. - Really? - I wanted to know, how did the investigation go? I am really lucky with a guy like you! Yesterday I put the photo in my pocket. May I open it? - Sure, it's yours. - Thank you. Then I went to the club, the Tahiti night club. I asked the bartender where the girl was. After some hesitation, he made a phone call. He gave me an address. Now I'm here thanks to the Holy Mary. - Was I clear about that? - Very clear. Stop! What do you want? Who are you? I'll tell you a story. Tomorrow it'll in the papers, - but you won't be alive. - You're crazy! Be careful. First I kill and then I investigate. This isn't great, but it'll kill a glass-cleaner like you. - What do you want from me? - I want Dogheart. Where is he? There. I was mutilated when I was a child. I don't believe it. Can you walk? Come on, let's go to bed. We have to leave. Get dressed, so then I can undress you. It'll be more exciting. Number 32, "Tropical Love". A pure silk dress with floral compositions, really nice lines. Claudia, continue, please. - Domenico, come to my office. - Thank you. - How are you? - Not bad. Our model is presenting a flowered chiffon dress. It is made up of two pieces... Did you get the money from the safety deposit boxes? Yes. Of course. Did you ever wonder how much space two million dollars take up, and how much they weigh? - What are you going to do? - Return the money to the German. Maybe someone you think is a friend is betraying you. Everyone is a traitor and a scoundrel in my line of work. We must question the relatives, the children, and the women. Especially, those who work for us. Yes. You can help me. I'm looking for a girl from Andronico's' circle. Sheikh's girlfriend. She's called Rosa. She vanished. She worked at the Tahiti. Bonino is looking for her. I don't trust guys like Bonino. Anyway, I'll get someone to look for her. You can relax. But my friends will do it. Okay, I'll tell him. Where are you going? You need authorization. I am Inspector Mauri, room 305. Go, but don't tire her out too much. It doesn't even look like a clinic. It's better than a hotel. You will be fine here. You're under a false name. No one will look for you here. And you'll be away from Dogheart. Kill him, I beg you! He is a pig! No one is as horrible as him. He has the right name, Dogheart. - Do you know him well? - Yes. Along with the others, the owners of the club, the drug king and those who kidnap. You lie down and they get on top of you. You are young and beautiful. You can have a new life. I lost track of the men who took me to bed. I tried to rebel but they drugged me. And so I started to fight less. Come on, now calm down. You have to help me, okay? Tell me about Sheikh. Didn't he tell you anything? You were together. He worked with Andronico. And lately they had done a big hit. A load of drugs. Then one evening he was desperate. He was crying with anger! He told me that all the stuff... had disappeared from where Andronico had put it. - Did he say who could have taken it? - Sheikh never knew. He died first. Dogheart laughed at that! Sheikh died in hassle and drugs. Dogheart had him killed and knew who took the drugs! - Who does Dogheart work for? - For Bonino, Laurenzi's partner. He is Dogheart's boss. He controls the whole harbor. It's impossible to supervise it. Too many people come and go. Now leave me alone, policeman. Excuse me. Is there a dead man or not? Not dead, but wounded. - Wounded? How? - Firearm. Finally! So 15 is injury, 18 is blood and 90 is fear. Don't blame me if you had such a lousy dream. I don't blame. You don't know how to interpret it. Me, Concetta Quagliarulo, can't interpret it? You need a cast for your head, not your arm. Who do you think suggested the numbers to notary Cardia? - It must have been someone's soul. - The soul of your dead kin! Who are you trying to fool? You have a jinx face. Jinx face? You're crazy! Taxi! Follow that motorbike. Don't lose sight of it. - Sir, is this a car chase? - Yes. Then it's double the fee. - I'm in the police force. - Then don't worry. Military and youngsters, half-price. I'll give you anything, just don't lose sight of him. Look at that guy. He's just traveling all around Naples. Now leave Naples and don't show up for a while. - You must disappear. - No, I'm staying here. I already told you. I'm not leaving Naples. You want to do things your way? Is this something new? You have to follow orders and do what I say. - Why should I leave? - You screwed up too much. What? I've always respected you! I always did what you people told me. I got the drugs back from Andronico and you hid it because you want to screw Laurenzi. And screw me too! You're saying bullshit. You want to stay? Then stay! I was saying it in your interest. Hurry up! Get in! Careful, I have one arm left! Faster, they're on us! Watch out for the truck! Are you hurt! I'll take care of it, come on. Stop! - What's happening? - Get out! Help! - Bonino got away. - You're a jackass! Come on, don't make that face. We will get him. - Yes? - It's me, Carola. My friends found Rosa. They found out that Andronico stole the drugs, but Bonino found them and had him killed by Dogheart. Now Bonino has the drugs and he wants to betray you. - He wants to run off with the stuff. - Is he in town now? Yes, he's probably still in Naples. I don't know where to find him. Maybe I know. You did a good job. You're an exceptional woman. Join me here and get back the hatbox. There's someone who wants to say hi. A mutual friend. I'll be waiting for you. Bye. - Yes, sir. - You must go to the mushroom farm. You'll find the stuff and Bonino, that piece of shit. I want them both here right now! Am I clear? It will be done, sir. Back, please. Stay back. Back up, please! Oh, my God! What a pity! So young and so beautiful! What are you going to do? She was here under a false name. They get everywhere. As long as they are here, law and justice are just words. Whoever is with them is afraid. The problem isn't only fear in Naples. The problem is hunger. Hunger as old as time. Is anyone here? Ruggero, what are you doing here? Don Mimì send his regards. Stop! Stop! Don't shoot! Stop! - Take us to him. - Right away. No tricks! Bonino is over there! - Where is the stuff? - Talk! Where is it? Don Domenico doesn't want to wait. Talk! It's in tunnel 3. Come on! Come on! Well? Bonino, you're shit-head. You caused a big commotion uselessly. You wanted to get smart and I hadn't realized it. Alright, but you must explain something to me. I can understand that you wanted to swindle me, but to side with the police... - No, not that! I swear. - Don't swear. Explain calmly, and maybe, if I understand why, I can be generous, and you know it. I'd gone to the mushroom farm to get the drugs. Dogheart indicated the place. He stole it. What have I got to do with the police? You should look in your home. What do you mean? At Andronico's funeral your little girl was talking to a cop. How can you suspect a little girl? It's true. The nanny said she saw Luisa talking to a man. - He was a cop! - She couldn't have known about the bank robbery and everything that happened. We talked about it here. She must have heard that. It's possible. In fact, it all began when that brat arrived. Where is she now? She could be listening to us from somewhere in the house. We must find her and make her talk! Let's go! Leave it. - Yes? - It's Luisa. Come now! I'm afraid! - Where are you? - At home. - The little girl? - Yes. Let's go to the villa. Luisa! Let's go. Luisa! Luisa, come out! Inspector Mauri, on my way to Laurenzi's villa. All cars available surround the area. Over. Luisa, where are you? Sorry, I stole it at the police station armory. You'll get a formal complaint. You're here! Why didn't you answer? What are you afraid of? - What did you do? - Let me go! Let me go. Have this viper repeat what she said. - Leave her and don't make her cry. - Do you know what she did? She hates us. She advised the police. Just now! - What's this all about, little one? - You killed my mom and I hate you! - Hands up! Police! - Or we'll shoot! Dario! Drop your guns right now! Bastard! You want to be a hero at the expense of this child? Drop the gun. Let me go! No! Help! Domenico! Carola... - Let me go! - Let me through. Away from the door. Move! Dario, help me! Let me go! Stop or I'll kill the girl! Don't shoot! No one intervene! - Let me go! - Let him take the car. Hello? It's Inspector Mauri. To all police stations. Total radio silence. Total radio silence! Operation Eagle 2 is starting. I repeat, Operation Eagle 2. Attention! Battalion! We'll go around the neighborhood. To these great gentlemen you'll serve dinner, lunch and breakfast. Forward, march! It's a trap! The police screwed me. Help! Let me go! Let me go! - Shut up! - Let me go! - Come! - You're hurting me! I don't want to come. Let me go! Let me go! Let me go! Darn you! Luisa! Luisa! Where are you? Come out. If I find you, it's too bad for you! Bonino! Stay where you are! Stop, Luisa! Good work, hero! Let's go, little one. This is not for you. Dario, is all this right?
