Graduation is upon us, yet I'm still single. But alas, the most popular gossip on campus is none other than other people's love lives. Especially the infamous Mission Impossible List abbreviated as MI. Mission Impossible. The impossible matches that people don't think would ever date. What an insane idea. So what? Is it wrong to be single? Is it wrong that you can't have your love? It's no one's business if they're into each other or not. But to be honest, I wonder what it feels like to be on that list. Maybe someday, my name will be on the list too? Heaven's secrets shall not be revealed. This saying is outdated. They are easy to come by. It only depends on whether you try to decipher them. I'm Tien Xiao-xiang, a senior physics student. I love astronomy. Astrolabe is my social media, astrology is my search engine, and tarot is my online god. It's done. This is my best friend, Song Yi-jing, a senior goddess from the Department of Fine Arts. A true Internet celebrity and good at promoting her image. She has tons of followers, at school and online, especially with my help. Since the day I met Yi-jing, I knew she's my queen. It's an honor and good luck to serve a queen. You're the best photographer. - Here. - Is this okay? It's beautiful. A professional Internet celebrity not only relies on herself, but she also interacts with guys to stay in the spotlight. Danny Lo, the heartthrob on campus, is the best choice. Li Zhu-hao is my long-time friend. We were classmates in junior high. We went to the same senior high. And now we're classmates again in university. He calls it an evil destiny and he never treats me like a girl. Hey, where's your bag? I forgot to bring it. I only need to cast divination blocks. Excuse me. One moment. He never knows when to say no. Not only Yi-jing, but everyone treats him like a tool. Even if he were only one step away from the cliff, he would still look at the sky like an idiot. He's forever optimistic. A dummy indeed. But the one who can't resist the dummy is me. Are you sure you want to confess your love? Hey! Don't sneak up on me like that. This kind of thing can't wait. You're out of your mind. Xiao-xiang, you wanted to see me? Take one. Take one. Hurry up. Thank you. Good! Let's take another one. That's good. Bad Sign "None of the four directions is the way." - It's raining? - It's raining! Xiao-xiang, get out of the rain. Today is the day! Are you nervous? - She's here! - It's Yi-jing. - So pretty! - Over here! - Yi-jing! - Yi-jing! The Sun? The Tree of Life and the Tree of Knowledge? The Mountain? Everything is 20% off today. You look so pretty today, ma'am. Call me Angel. - Angelababy. - Tian Xiao-xiang. I brought my pet to help you. Here. What is this? The sun, angel, and trees. Perfect. You're going to do it this time for real? Zhu-hao, I am coming. Yi-jing, I like you. Please be my girl. My goodness. Are you serious about this? Please say you're just kidding. I'm serious. But this is rather abrupt. Well... Maybe we should take a vote. If most of the people agree, I would say yes. Do you all agree? - No! - No! Rui-rui, let's take a picture first. Guys, let's take a picture. - Sure. - Sure. - Let's take a picture. - Excuse me. Take a rest if you're tired. Lie down when you're weary. Don't rush it. Don't press it. Save your faith in love in the heart. As long as you keep it, it'll come to you someday. This is Fourone. Thank you for tuning in today. I wish you a beautiful day. Goodbye. Everyone is passing along the challenge. I guess Zhu-hao's confession of love won't succeed. It created quite a stir. People are starting to follow me. The MI List. Mission Impossible. Jumping off a building is easier. It's okay if you can't accomplish it. What do you mean? Don't tell me you will play along. I'll give Zhu-hao a chance. Hi, guys. I read your comments. I hereby announce this challenge. If Zhu-hao can accomplish the top three pairings on the MI List, I'll accept his love. Awesome! You are very close! Hey! Another book signing event from your idol. You're too old to be a fangirl. What do you know? Fourone is my spiritual mentor. Not like you, a sucker for love. Who's a sucker for love? You told me Yi-jing is your queen, and you asked me to help her. What? Are you jealous? Come on. Don't flatter yourself. Do you want to help me accomplish the MI List challenge then? How dare you ask me for this kind of favor? Win Yi-jing over yourself. Of course I would ask. We do everything together. We're close. - Awesome! - My goodness. - A Wonder Woman. - You are great! I always kicked your ass in junior high. That's because I wasn't fully grown yet. But now... - Right? No kidding. - No. I'm strong as a bull. - Let's have a bet. - What's the bet? If you lose, you'll help me accomplish the MI List. If you win... Don't ever ask me for help again. Why didn't you tell me that you're into Yi-jing? - Boss... - I'm sorry. Is this your turf, dumb ass? - I'm sorry. - Go away. - She didn't mean it. - Tell her to step forward. I'm really sorry. Which part didn't you understand? Sorry. - I said she didn't mean it. - Kick his ass! - Trying to be a hero? - How could you hit a girl? Protecting your girlfriend? Trying to be a hero? Kick his ass! It's your turn right away. Are you okay? Let's go... After them! Hurry! Stop! Hurry! Stop! Stop! Hurry! Hurry! This way! Catch this. That way. Stop! We don't have time for this. Stop! This way. Xiao-xiang, hurry. The freezer. A freezer is not a good idea... What are you doing? Come this way. Are you okay? I'm fine. Let's go. Where are you going? Are you an athlete? You were fast. Why don't you run away again? Let's talk about compensation. Medical bills... - What else? - Psychological trauma. - Don't touch us. - Mental scars. Plastic surgery. That's right. Plastic surgery. Are you done? Boss Lady Yu. It's none of your business. Don't... What the heck? I'm seriously injured. Do you know who's in charge here? Get lost. Let's leave. Have a nice day. Why are you two still here? Let's go. Here, take that! Take that! You win! Hey. Hey, Li Zhu-hao. If you don't want to play, go and cook instant noodles for me. I'm starving. Okay. There are only two left. Is that enough? Yes. It should be enough. Thank you. The blue one is for your feet. Seriously? Haven't I already told you? Hey, I'm taking a shower. My goodness! - My goodness! - My goodness! What's that smell? Your instant noodles! Close the door! Are we strangers, Xiao-xiang? You ordered the wrong size. Seriously? Cancel it now. How do you cancel it? - Hurry up. - You're strong. Okay, I'll help. What? The MI List. The third name on the MI List is Boss Lady Yu, who owns the bar across from our school. A true badass. She's intimidating. Everyone is a coward in front of her. No one can conquer her. Except for one person. This is a robbery! Listen, I have a knife. I have... Wait! I have a knife! Hand over the cash! Hurry up! You can tell me about your difficulties. Maybe I can help you. It's not your business! Give me the cash. Now! What are you looking at? You're committed to your wife, but you just need cash. You can't find a steady job. So you can't pay your kids' tuition. It's not easy being a dad. Nietzsche said, "The one who suffers can't afford to be pessimistic. For if one feels pessimistic, one will lose the courage to face reality and the power to fight one's struggles. In the end, one will suffer more." Here. Your wife and children are waiting for you at home. Come and negotiate my deals for me. I could use your talent. All great things are zigzagging towards one's goals. All straight lines are deceiving. All truths are crooked. There are two types of people in the world. One is happy pigs, the other is suffering human beings. His name is Ah-shan, a philosophy student in his second year of grad school. You would rather be a suffering human being than a happy pig. It's hard to imagine that he's her type. Boss Lady Yu, we never managed to convince him. He convinced our own men instead. Those two kids said they want to go to college now. Maybe we should postpone this for a while. "Postpone for a while"? What kind of crap is that? I don't care. I will have him. Is she falling for him? I'll kill you. "Falling for him"? Will I fall for anyone? If anyone says that again, I'll smash his mouth. Darn it. The second name on the MI List is Professor Stone from the Department of Fine Arts. Proud on the outside, cold on the inside. Not only is she a lonely and an older single woman, but she also decided never to get married. Furthermore, the chance to be graded below 50 by her is 90%, but getting a grade of between 50 and 60 is also 90%. Repaint it. I don't know what's wrong with Zhi-liang from the gym, but he treats Professor Stone like a goddess. I heard that he has been into her for years. Stone, this treadmill has some new functions. Do you want me to show you? If you talk to me again, I'll stop coming here. Also, am I a fool to you? No. No. Zhi-liang is fit like a bull, but his heart is easily bruised. The first name on the MI List is none other than the female Einstein from our department. She's proud and arrogant, a loner who would ruin your mood without reasons. And never catch her eye. Because her misanthropic gaze will make you doubt your life. What are you looking at? Have you never seen a cute guy? - Good morning. - Good morning. You're so early today. I didn't pass the replacement exam. Which subject? Let me see. I'm guessing it's radish cake again. These are the notes from last week. The orange highlights are the key points of the class. You can concentrate on those. I'll take this week's notes for you. Stop taking notes for me. I don't know what's going on in Ah-yu's mind. She knows Danny Lo doesn't want her to do these things, but she just won't leave him alone and declares her affection in class. Danny baby. It makes Danny want to burrow himself. Danny That's weird. Ah-yu is a Gemini, and Danny a Libra. And their major star in the Spouse Palace happens to be facing the star of the other's Self Palace. What does it mean? It means they're a perfect match. But they look like an unlikely couple. She must be an escort. Idiot. What are you talking about? Hurry up. We're losing her. Hurry up. Come on. Excuse me. There are so many people. It's hard to find her. Excuse me. - Do you see her at the bar? - No. But there are lots of hot girls. Captain, you're here too. You guys are here too. The music is the bomb. - Sushi! - Sushi! - Sushi! - Sushi! - Encore! - Encore! Have you made any progress? There's no progress yet. Yi-jing, if you're not interested in Zhu-hao, just tell him. Don't mess with him. Have I ever said I'm not interested? So what's up? Maybe you can check if Zhu-hao and I are perfect for each other. Sure. Is this the Death card? Yes. So Zhu-hao and I have no hope. Okay, I see. I'm heading out. Bye. - Bye. - Bye. Hey, doesn't a reversed Death card have other meanings? Like, a new beginning? Why is there fruit? It's quite sweet. Have one. Xiao-xiang gave me a tarot reading last night. The future for Zhu-hao and me doesn't seem too promising. Is it good? Please sign here. A young girl like you don't have trouble paying the monthly medical bill. That's impressive. It's not easy. Not at all. It's not easy for you either. Don't mention it. By the way, thank you for the fruit for my mom. Fruit? It's from your friend, not from us. Who is it? - That tall and handsome guy. - That handsome guy. He visits often. Didn't you know? - Last time... - He cut his finger and bled. We were shocked and tried to stop his bleeding. But you know what? He smiled foolishly. Like a kid. How cute. Everyone here likes him. Training muscles comes with pain, let alone love. Heartache is not an ache. I see it as training. It's nothing. You must be used to it. I don't know why, but I always push her buttons. What is your deal with Stone, Zhi-liang? It's a long story. Stone was a famous painter. She won the first prize in an international competition. After that, she became sloppy, winning second place at best, and spiraled downward. One day, she stopped painting altogether. She destroyed all her tools. But deep down, I know she wants to paint. For you. To encourage her to paint, I bought the best and newest tools for her. She refused and yelled at me for no reason. We've been close since college. I was injured in a competition, and she took care of me for six months. Here. This. Are these both of you? This is a confession of love, right? Without saying it out loud. But I know she had feelings for me. Stone had feelings for Zhi-liang, but not anymore. Why does she keep going to the gym then? How will I know? You girls change your mind easily. - You should tell me. - Don't take it as an opportunity to vent. I'm telling the truth. Hey, look. Hurry up. Let's follow them. Okay. A baby seat? No way. He's a doctor. Let's go out. - Do you want to go somewhere? - Let's go and play. - Where do you want to go? - Legoland. - Careful. - Careful. Watch your head. His name is Chen Xin-fan. It's him? Do you know him? He tried to date her in college. I should've backed down. I'm the other man. No, don't tell me you're quitting. Thank you, guys. I'm returning this to you. Thank you. Anything else? I'm going away. Where are you going? My hometown. A high school asked me to be their PE teacher. I could spend more time with my parents too. They're getting old. They need my company. That's it. Bye. What's wrong? Nothing. Can you carry me back? After I'm gone, no one will bother you anymore. Take care of yourself. Eat your three meals. Stay healthy. Exercise when you can. Stay positive. I already told the gym. Everything will stay the same. You can contact me anytime. I'll be at your beck and call. What's your plan after graduation? After graduation? What can a physics graduate do? Maybe a fortune teller. How about you? Me? To make money first, of course. And then I'll bring my mom home. I'm exhausted. If a successful girl like you is exhausted, I should just give up on my life. You are ridiculous. How has Li Zhu-hao been recently? What do you mean? You're strange. I thought your challenge was to turn him down. Why do you care about him? I... I think... I like him a little. I want to accept him. That's great. After hearing his feelings and seeing him do those things for me, I was quite touched. It got me thinking that maybe we can try it out. But... But what? Xiao-xiang. Can you do me a favor? Please. What does Yi-jing want to talk to me about? Why did she send you for me? You guys are annoying. Why don't you come up with me? She said she wanted to talk to you alone. Okay. I would like to talk to you about Yi-jing. - Actually, I... - I don't want to get involved in your love. Just go to her. Listen... Go. - Here you are. - Hi. Why are you so secretive? I want to talk to you in person. What's up? How long? What do you mean? I heard that you visit my mom in the hospital regularly. Is it here? Why were you so careless? It was an accident. Thank you. Thank you for doing these things for me. I feel like I have someone to rely on. Is this what you wanted to talk about? I like you. But if we're going to date, we need to keep a low profile, otherwise, it'll affect my work. And forget about the MI List. But we're already midway. I don't want you to continue. Why? Because... you're mine. When it comes to love, you can only try your best, not for him to love you, but for you to have no regrets. Don't give up on loving someone or being loved no matter what. You can take your time but never quit. It's not pathetic to love first, but it's pathetic to not love at all. The MI List. How interesting. Am I your entertainment? Stop it. - I'll do it. - Good. - Good. - Good. You all saw that. This is what a man should be. Protecting his woman without hesitation. - Awesome. - Awesome. Force it down. - Drink it down. - Awesome. You're good. Don't puke. Li Zhu-hao! I'm sorry. We were wrong. Can you let us go? Sure. Finish the rest, and I'll let you go. I'll drink. A round of applause. A great drinker. I'll hand it to you. If you like Ah-shan, just say it. Don't be afraid. We'll help you. Can you not say anything at a time like this? You have some guts to speak to me like this. It's better to be defeated by love than to surrender in front of fear. What are you talking about? He's drunk. Okay! From now on, you two are under my wings. You want to help? Then help me get Ah-shan. Do you hear me? Yes, sir! What are you doing? Hey! Thank you. You take care of my protégés all the time. I want to repay you. So come and see me if you need help, or just come by to have a drink. Don't say no. Got it? This is awkward. You should be more direct. Reveal your feelings directly. Directly? Yes. Okay. Let's try this. Ah-shan. From now on, you are my man. If you want to beat someone, I'll beat him for you. If someone wants to beat you, I'll beat him for you too. Anyway, in short, you are mine now. That's direct enough, right? No, Boss Lady Yu. Let's try something else. Try talking softly. Softly? I can't. I never talk softly. I don't know how to. You're in love. Try to be romantic. Anyway, if he doesn't come, I'll kidnap him. - I'll do it now. - Wait. Maybe you can change your style. Do you know the type of girls he likes? It's DJ Sushi! So? Why are you so excited? She's super famous. She even wears a mask in private. That's too mysterious. Boss Lady Yu. I have to see what's going on. Stay here. Okay. What? Nothing. - Don't touch her stuff. - I'm only tidying up. This is what happens when you try to save 20 dollars. Don't go. Just two minutes of your time. It's you again. I'm busy. What? - Busted! - Busted! Since you know Danny likes Sushi, why don't you tell him you are Sushi? I don't know what you're talking about. Tell him you're Sushi. You'll have a chance. I'm not a dummy like you. Do you think if you set us up, Yi-jing will date you? The same goes for you. Is it so hard to admit it? Can you not be a weirdo for once? Hey. She didn't mean it. Am I wrong? We're trying to help you. If you tell him, your relationship will improve. If you find out your idol is a weirdo, will you want to date him? Can you accept your lover to do the same things repeatedly? I can't stand any unpredictability or anything unsymmetrical. I only step on the white lines when crossing, and I walk within the frames. These are the things I do. Can you take it? I don't even know why I do it. Can you tell me what's wrong with me? Do you think I love to be alone? That I don't want to be a normal person? Even if I tell him I am Sushi, so what? I can't have my life with him wearing a mask, can I? Without a mask, Sushi is weirdo Ah-yu. Stop pretending that you understand me and that you're my friends. I don't have any friends and I don't need friends! I'm already in pain! Can you please just leave me alone? Ah-chong! Wait! Ah-yu. You call this "help"? This is odd. What exactly went wrong? Did we mess up? I think the situation is worse. How can it be? The fortune-telling said otherwise. If you don't want this, I'll eat it. I'll take your tomato. Is it pretty? Not bad. It suits you. That's good. I want to learn tarot. Teach me. No, I'll just read your cards. Come on. I don't want to. Okay. - How about that one? - Be serious. Take a card after you're ready. This one. A man hanging upside down. What does it mean? This is the Hanged Man card. It usually implies sacrifice. But not against one's will. It's done willingly. Look at his expression. It's calm and peaceful. Sacrifice? Sacrifice what? It can be anything. From concession to work to arguments between friends. Look at the glow of wisdom above his head. It means the sacrifice comes with understanding. He knows his sacrifice will be worthwhile. So this includes love. It can include love. Did you ask about love? No, it's about my future career. Xiao-xiang. Do you like Zhu-hao too? You have feelings for him. Impossible. Me and him? It's impossible. It makes me sick just to think of it. Liar. Why didn't you tell me you have feelings for him? Am I really your friend? Yes. Then tell me the truth. But you are the one he loves. I am aware of that, so... It's my own decision. It has nothing to do with you. You're still my queen. My best friend. Both of you are. Zhu-hao Aren't you going to answer that? I'm sorry. It's okay. Can you stay away from him? Zhu-hao and I are dating officially. But you guys hang out every day, it makes me uncomfortable. I know. I understand. So... Are we still friends? Promise me. You'll keep your distance. Zhu-hao I think I know Stone's secret now. Meet me at the dorm. Power Off You can't go in. Everything will turn out fine. Don't you wish Zhu-hao to be happy too? I'm not as brave as you are. You are braver than you think. It's just that you don't know it. - Bye. - Okay. Xiao-xiang, where's Zhi-liang? The bus just left. How could you let him go? I didn't know! You should've come earlier. You're riding too fast. Did you see the license plate? Of course not. How about the color? I don't know. The colors of the rainbow! What "colors of the rainbow"? It's that one! - Please open the door. - What's going on? Do you have a death wish? This is reckless. We're sorry. Ride into a pole if you want to die. Do you know how dangerous it is? - Zhi-liang. - Hey! You can't leave. You can't miss your chance. What do you want? Do you know him? - It's very dangerous. - I don't know him. - That was dangerous. - Get off. - You guys... - Get off. - Stop this nonsense. - Call the police. Stone! I knew nothing about you. I'm sorry. I didn't get your painting. Does Stone look like a strong person to you? Is there something wrong with her? She came to me a few years ago, because she didn't feel well. It turned out that she has ALS. When ALS gets you, your body will lose its functions gradually. You curl. You paralyze. You can only stare at the ceiling in the end. So after that painting, she knew she would never be who she was. She could never have a normal life, never love who she wants to. This is the fate of ALS patients. You're not in love with anyone. You just don't dare to love. You should know I'm a person with perseverance. No matter what will become of you, you will never change in my eyes. You don't need to love me. Don't love me just because I care for you. I only want to be by your side. Can you let me do that? You are really silly. It has been more than ten years. You are not young anymore. Why can't you just find someone to be with? Please. Let me go. And give yourself a break. You're the only one I want. I'm sick. And it'll only get worse. The things that you want... To me... They are wishful thinking. I don't even dare to think about it. I don't even know how much time I got left before I could only be confined to the bed, completely paralyzed. What do you want from me? I love you without conditions. It's your choice to give up on yourself. But I won't give up on you. That's also my choice. I'll never walk away from you. Yes! I think fans here have already read the new book just like I did, and were just as moved. I love one part of the book particularly. Before he signs your books, I would like to ask Fourone to read that part to us. "Can I be the humblest one in love? I retreat to the back. I stop finding out if it's right or wrong. All I wish is a yes from him. Your love is never humble. Always remember that." Hey, take it. Okay. I'm only messing with you. What? Hey! Your fever hasn't come down. Get up and take your pills. Here. There's toast on the table. Have some when you can get up. Thank you. Lie down now. Thank you. Yi-jing and I have to go to the movies, will you join us? I like it. What's your favorite movie genre? Is it horror? Family? Romance? Comedy? Or... This is good. Do you want to try it? Li Zhu-hao. What are you looking at? It's gross! Do you want to try it? You know, I never understood the grass on the side. Hey, I'm talking to you. What did you say? I said this is good. Do you want to try it? Why aren't you replying? Did something happen? Why aren't you telling me? Tian Xiao-xiang, what happened? I'm worried. - Are you okay? - I'm good. Hey. - Come over here. - What? Come over here. What do you want? Why are you avoiding me? Why should I? I'm not. Stop pretending. You even changed your shift this month. Of course you are. I'm not. Wait. I'm not done yet. I don't have time for what you have to say. Boss Lady Yu is asking for me. I'm running late. Hey. Don't you think you should ask me to join you? Listen, from now on, forget about the MI List. - I'll take care of it. - Why? We finally solved the issues between Zhi-liang and Professor Stone. Of course I'll continue. Besides, I can't let you deal with it alone. That's enough. I can take care of it myself. This doesn't feel right. Are you sure Ah-shan will like this style? Stop. Are you the king of styles? No, you are! Here he comes. Hey! Boss Lady Yu. Hi. What's up with the outfit? This is my new style. Do you like it... Are you all right? I'm fine. Is this pretty to you... Since you're fine, I have to go. Hey! Where are you going? The library. The library? The library is great. To study? That's great. Did you... What do you do other than studying? - I go to the movies. - Go to the movies. Yes! Listen, let's go to this movie tonight. Boss Lady 3. I already got the tickets. This isn't what I like... What? It's just a movie. It won't take much of your time. Just decide. - I'm not into this genre... - You'd better say yes. - Stop! - You'd better say yes. Darn it. You didn't pay your debt, loser. You made us come to collect from you. Don't do this. It's embarrassing. Where's the money? Stay where you are. It's none of your business. Okay. Let's talk about this. When are you going to pay us back? Hey. There are other passengers on the bus. Get off at the next stop. I'll only say it once. It's you. Are you going on a date, all dressed up? Stay out of it. Go away. Don't touch the lady. - It's none of your business. - Darn it. Don't hit her. - Sit down! - Don't fight! Stop the bus! - Stop fighting! - What are you doing? Jerks, get off the bus now. I already called the police. They'll be here any minute. - Let's go! - Let's go! Are you okay? Darn it! When I'm out, that fat boy is dead! Sure. Boss Lady Yu, calm down. Aren't you in pain? Of course I'm in pain! My heart aches the most. Darn it. Look at me. They just destroyed it. I'll never confess my love anymore. - What the... - You're awake? You must be hungry. Have something first. I'm glad it's not life-threatening. It's nothing serious. Boss Lady Yu... How come every time you're around me, this kind of thing happens? Yes. What are you saying? I'm talking to him. Go and wait there. Go. It also happened in the convenience store. Why? Actually, you were trying to protect him, right? After that, I've been wondering what kind of a person you really are. You didn't fight back on the bus because you wanted to protect the passengers, right? Yes. Okay, I know. You won't be interested in a girl like me. Anyway, I think people can change. So... I just want to be with you. If you think we are from different worlds, it's okay, I can go to your world, right? You want to come to my world to protect me? Yes. Well, it depends. It can be anything. Don't fight again. Don't pull any dangerous stunts again. Sure, okay. Wait. you said "again." What did you say? You said "again." Did he say "again"? So do you mean... Darn it. Why didn't you wait for me? Where are you going? Hey, Ah-yu and Danny are the only ones on the list now. We can solve it, right? Stop pestering me. Can you leave me alone? I need to go. What's wrong with you lately? When did I piss you off? Can you let me know? There's nothing wrong. There's something wrong. You didn't answer my calls. You didn't reply to my messages. Something's wrong. Is there something you need to tell me? Are you seeing someone now? Seriously? Why didn't you tell me? Enough, Zhu-hao. Yes, I'm seeing someone. And you're seeing someone too. So please keep your distance. Because I don't want to give Yi-jing and her fans the wrong idea. And I definitely don't want to give my boyfriend the wrong idea! The fact that you won't leave me alone annoys me! It's troublesome! Stay away! The last dish. I made it myself. This is quite a spread. I want to make it up to you. When we date, you can only keep a low profile. Here. - Thank you. - Is it tasty? Yes, it's tasty. Listen, eat it with strawberries. It's super fresh. It's fine. I got it. Why are you smiling? Will you go to a place with me? - Sushi! - Sushi! - Sushi! - Sushi! I have something to say to her. Did you hear what I just said? The Sushi you like and the Ah-yu you detest are both really her. She transforms after she puts on the mask. Darn it. The Psychology of OCD Behaviors I just... care too much about what other people think of me, so I don't dare to look at all that you've done for me. Tease her. - Hey. Now! - Go and tease her. Hey. What? No way. What are you doing? Take it. What are you doing? - Hey! What are you doing? - Hey! - She's pretty! - So pretty! I know no one will love him more than I do, but who'd want to date a weirdo? But be it Ah-yu or Sushi, they are both you. Don't you hate me? I... I love you. - Together forever. - Together forever. - Together forever. - Together forever. - Kiss her. - Kiss her. - Cheers! - Bottoms up! - Hurry up! - Bottoms up! It's a happy day. Come on. - Come on, cheers. - Cheers. Come on. - Enough. - Bottoms up! - You are drinking too much. - Hey, you. Come over here. Don't stand there. Come over and drink together. Hurry up! - I'm coming, Boss Lady Yu. - Why are you there? I'm here. I'm coming. Who do you think you are? I meant her. Don't challenge other people to drink. You never listen. No. It's not her. It's me. I'm used to saying this. I need some time to change. Don't change. You should be yourself. You are so reasonable. Here. I'll drink with you. Hey, I finished it. That was a sip. Awesome. That's more like it. Drink more. Tell your boss to step forward! - Who are you? - What do you want? Take them away. The rest can get lost now. Your intimacy is gross. Mr. Ma, this is between you and me. Tell them to get out of this bar and we'll talk. You're not getting younger. Find a man. I'm a perfect match for you. And stop picking fights. Why are you here? Of course I should be here. Aren't you supposed to be in the hospital? Ah-chong is there too. Because of Zhu-hao. I thought you were there yesterday? Yes. Why are you here? What happened to Zhu-hao? Calm down. Zhu-hao is still weak from surgery. The nurse said he needs to stay in the ICU for observation. What surgery? What surgery? Why was he injured? What happened to him, Yi-jing? To save me yesterday, he got stabbed. The doctors said he needs to stay. Thank you for visiting. I can handle this. Go home now. Why are you acting strong? I want to help out here too. Can you go home? Please? Why? I can't stay because I like him too? Yes. Okay. I don't need to like him that way. I don't need to. Can you stop acting like this? Do you think you're the only one suffering? I'll move out today. Please stay away from us, from now on. Why did you lie to her? Why didn't you stop me then? Recently, all you can talk about is Fourone. Even during your afternoon nap. Ridiculous. That's nothing. Because I can't agree with him more. So you like him? Yes. I like him a lot. I think he totally understands me. But I understand you too. Do you like me? You idiot. Who likes you? Are you every girl's dream? I was only joking. Did you take it seriously? Shut up. What's your plan for Valentine's Day tomorrow? I don't know. Sleep in, I guess. That's boring. Yes, right, you're the only one who's interesting. What's your plan? I want to... Idiot! Hey! Get me some tissues. Hurry up! What is this? Wait. Hold on. I love you. Do you love me? Hey, here you are. This is Li Zhu-hao, the one I told you about. - Hi. - Hi. Please take nice pictures of her. So the camera is for her? Of course. It's not for me. Let me adjust the angle for you. How's your mom? When I was in high school, she had a car accident. Doctors said she sustained a serious brain injury. Her condition hasn't changed. How about your dad? I don't know. I've never met him. Can you pretend to be my boyfriend? A fake boyfriend? Yi-jing, I like you. My livestream views have dropped lately. I want to create an issue to regain my popularity. But can you not tell anyone? Especially Xiao-xiang. - Actually, I... - I don't want to get involved in your love. Listen... Go. I like you. Let's take Xiao-xiang away. Call the police! What happened, Zhu-hao? Are you okay, Zhu-hao? My goodness! Hang in there. Don't fall asleep! What happened to him? - I don't know. - Ah-chong, call an ambulance! Zhu-hao! Xiao-xiang... Don't scare me! Hang in there. Somebody help! Zhu-hao! You're awake? Do you want some water? Where's Xiao-xiang? Lie down first. Is she all right? Worry about yourself first. You've been in the hospital for a week. I'll call the doctor. Put it on. - My goodness. - Look who's back. Quiet, everyone. Yi-jing said that she'll announce something on livestream. Is she going to accept you? Do you really want to start this nonsense club? That's superstitious. All will hide their secrets here, and only I can unlock them. A dummy like you won't understand. Can I hide my secret here then? It's up to you. Xiao-xiang. Why didn't you visit me in the hospital? Why should I? You're fine now. My boyfriend is waiting for me. Happy graduation. Happy graduation. Yi-jing. - Actually, I... - You don't need to say it. Actually, I already knew. I just didn't want to admit defeat. - Xiao-xiang... - Do you know? When you collapsed, the first one you asked for was Xiao-xiang. Where's Xiao-xiang? When you woke up in the hospital, the first one you asked for was her again. I only found out after I kissed you that day. You have no feelings for me, and there's no way I could replace her. It was my wishful thinking. I was in your way. I won't insist on having my way again. I hope you won't hate me. Okay! I lied to you all. You all fell for it, right? I was messing with you all. Actually, Zhu-hao was helping me to test your loyalty. I asked Zhu-hao to fake it. So don't hate him. Okay? That's it for today. There's one more thing. Happy graduation to you guys. Bye. I love you all. An old friend fell very ill a while ago. I'm glad to find out that he was released from the hospital today. He's a nice and kind boy. His story moved me. And he's the inspiration for my book Do You Love Me As I Love You? A request from a certain corner. From Li Zhu-hao Fourone, I have a childhood friend. She's a sweet girl. But she seems to only see me as a friend. I want to tell her that I love her. But I'm afraid if I reveal my feelings, we can't even be friends. She loves your books and your radio show. I often tease her and call her a fangirl. Actually, I only want to make my feelings known. But maybe to her, it's better that I am just a friend and supports her quietly. To Xiao-xiang: Good luck. Fourone Do You Love Me As I Love You? Thank you. Yes! - Hey, here you are. - Xiao-xiang... Let me introduce you. This is my new roommate, Song Yi-jing. Hi. Xiao-xiang, you wanted to see me? I assume she already got the book. Will the girl he loves like it and accept him? I don't know. I wrote down two words at the end of every article in the book, just to wish this boy well, and I wish everyone has no regrets in love. Good luck. Li Zhu-hao. Yi-jing lied to you. Zhu-hao got stabbed to protect you. What do you mean? Ah-chong, call an ambulance. Somebody help! Why didn't you tell me earlier? What are you doing? Go away! I'll never believe in this again. What are you doing? Can I hide my secret here then? - I think... - What? No, it's nothing. I think you're an excellent driver. Move! Get out of the way! Faster! Move. Li Zhu-hao, pick up the phone! The train! Hurry up. Okay! Xiao-xiang drew this Hanged Man card. She has been sacrificing. For friendship and for love. You're the one Xiao-xiang loves. It has always been you. Xiao-xiang... She loves you, but she's afraid to say so. You both should've been together a long time ago. Two idiots. I asked for too much. To have you and Xiao-xiang as friends is more than I could ask for. Good luck, Li Zhu-hao. I wish you two happiness. Hurry up! Hurry up! - I'm sorry. - You can't go! - We'll pay for the tickets later. - It's urgent! Wait! Li Zhu-hao! Wait! Wait! Li Zhu-hao! Are you on the train, Zhu-hao? Xiao-xiang. Why did you scream my name? Where did you go? To enjoy the scenery. You forgot your stuff. I brought it for you. What stuff? A secret. What secret? It's your secret. I brought it for you. Do You Love Me As I Love You? Maybe you haven't noticed that I've been secretly admiring you. I've watched you zone out, doze off, laugh out loud, and hold back your tears. But when you look back at me, I turn away instantly. I'm mad that I can't pluck up my courage. Maybe I'm a coward. Every time I look at you, I swallow my words because I'm too nervous. I can only confess my love to you with this book. Xiao-xiang, I love you. Do you love... You can even recite every word. Why did you wait until now? Because you didn't catch my hints. More than once. Say it again. I said you didn't catch my hints. Not this one. I love you. Do you love me as I love you? Again. I said, "I love you." Thank you for loving me as well.
