How are you dear? - Hello! Why was not the gathering? - Nobody told me. You're bored. - Nonsense. Just so you think. - Normal. It's not pleasant to you to meet with the gates. The other time you warn me. - All right. Chao, until recently! - Chao! Do not worry. Everything is under control! The globe is paid. We should call them shareholders for signature. Why did not you tell me for counseling, Dad? You empower me, so you do not have to come. Only when I'm traveling. You intend to sell the company. I want to read it document and sign it. No. I do not agree. You will not sell the land. You said never you will not sell it. I changed my mind. - Please? The company is selling, because the moment is right. That is all. How are you?

Sorry. - Why do not you tie it? I do not tie dogs! The dogs were created to be tied. No, I do not tie them. Пополека. You need to tie it. - No. At home there are small children. - Do not worry. The other way ... - Neptune is meek. The other way ... Do not drag. - It hurts! The other way I'll kill him. Do not you dare! - Do you know what "Glock" is? Let me go!

Where is Neptune? - It's here, ma'am. You come early. How are you? - All right. Is Usar still contoured? Where are your boots? Are we in the hammer? No. This time you ride like that. Put this on. The horse is waiting for you. Nice horse. Are you ready? - Yes. Good. Slowly. Lower the heels. Clip your hips well. And the other. Do not breathe. Breathe slowly. Exhale. Just like that! Deep down. Exhale slowly. Good. Antonia, take a walk around the horse. You appeared! - Stand behind your friend. Do not laugh at me! - You came! Come on, no stories. - Why are you laughing? Stop shitheads, I said! - What are you laughing at? Lower your hands, Antonia. Help! Find something that we will extinguish. Good de. - Come on, you're alive! Shuffle! The hose! Lively! You're gone!

Of course. - Thank you. My mother adored him. He knew all the songs. He sang under the shower. She was so funny! Honey or sugar? - Honey. One or two? - Two. By your sweetheart. - Yes. Say "I love you", nothing means ... The honest words, which make sense, come from the heart. You are a romantic nature. Romantic! Just keep silence! Why? - Because they will crucify me. Who? - My husband. He says I'm getting carried away on lullaby songs. Bray, how kind he is. Love like mine can not sink like a rock in the river. There's no end ... Are you in the picture? - Very clear. I was in Uruguay. I got the first place. Fierce jump! Is it unusual for you? No. - Just a little? Nonsense! I was never afraid of anything. Have you dealt with horses for a long time? - Yes. My grandfather and my father were riding horses. When I was 3 years old I was boarded on one mare. Dreams that bring pain ... You know them by heart! - I need to understand if you want me to be a lover. I'm not telling you! Have you ever lived here? 30 years. And I still have not paid the house. What happened to your wife? You left. - Just like that? That's right. - Poor! Nonsense. I'm very good. Do you want to be my lover. Reason misleads me, my heart is leading a parade. I can not fight with love. I always fall in love with a man, which does not suit my feelings. That's why my soul is rising. That's why ... - It's hypocrisy. In Brussels they will not sell you a nunchaku, because it is a weapon, which is borne inconspicuous. People ... - Selling weapons ... I represent you his riding instructor. I'm glad to come! - It's Pedro. Pedro! Riding instructor. My dad, Amal, Jules. All are very sympathetic. We have not seen you for a long time, Mr. Colonel. Do you know? At that time I was still with hair. I looked like Marlon Brando, did not you? The years pass. You look good. - Thank you. Is everything okay? I'm dealing with horses. You ask about this, do not you? Daddy two, because he's a celebrity! What are you doing? - Colorful wreaths, daddy. To Make Us Happy! The pictures will be incredible. Jules ... - When you learn something ... Surely it's turning around your little finger. - Your daughter is very cordial. Go to calm the dog. Does it bind it? - What could I do? What do you mind? Why tie it? - Running up and down. I asked you not to tie it! - He took Osvaldo's trousers off! Show and, to see! - Do not tie him! Osvaldo loves dogs! - Me too. Not true! - I want them. Here's her cake! Rosita. Wait for me. Now I'm returning. You lit the spark plugs. Do you want something to drink? - I'm coming now! Let's blow the spark plugs. The idea is from the New Year's celebrations. What should I tell you ... As if I were in Tahiti. Come on. We are ready. - He brought the dog too. Let's say hello to Dad, crowned with wreaths, along with a happy puppy. We start at three. One two Three. Happy birthday to you! Are you so bored? - No. You're getting tired. Yes, I wanted to be alone. I'm fine here. Are you sure? I'll bring you a cake. Coffee is disgusting. Where did you get it? I do not feel any difference. It's not the same. It's the same. Who bought it? Rosa took it from "Ekonom"? And please, before you bring unknown people in my home, at least ask me. He is my horse instructor. He is a military person, Mimi! Military person! Your gender is full of military personnel. I do not see what the problem is. You do not see, right? That's your problem. You do not see what the problem is. You do not see anything. Last night, you did good. I saw you were satisfied. We need to put a little chlorine on. Do not rush... Wonderful ... In the back! Hands down. Diay slowly. Very good. Great. Anto! Hello! - Antonia. How are you? - All right. Thank you. Mr. Colonel. Can we talk? Where is the policeman Castillo? They moved him. I'm running the expertise. Take the horse, Mariana. We'll see you on Tuesday. Take him to the backpack. Where's my whip? - Inside. Sorry, because of the burning did the cola come? No, they are constantly pulled. There are charges against the colonel. What do they blame him for? - For what? Did not you see the work "Cordillera"? I did not know about it. Did not understand, that Nicholas has replaced him? Yes, but I thought he was sick. No, they took it. I thought you knew. Ella! They do not move. What? - They do not want to move. You exaggerate! I tried with psychological methods. You did not have a whip. - It is possible. Was the fire coming? - What kind of fire? The car of the Colonel was almost burnt. Did not you know? - Yes, but I came for another occasion. Thank you. It's true, Colonel Was he in jail? Since when do you know him? - Sooner. Judge him for violating human rights. Wait for judgment. - What are they blaming for? There are thousands of missing. I do not know if you know. I asked you a specific question. - The case is trusted. Can we ever see ourselves, to speak? Please. - All right. Javier Rohas. And you? Mariana Blanco. You can ask me for Google. And you already know! Whore! Thank you. - There is no reason. Did you hear what I said? - They seem to be judging him. Why? - I have no idea. It looks like you should find another instructor. Why? - How's that "why"? Do not you realize how serious it is? Clearly ... - What? Since when you get so excited about human rights? What are you aiming at? He always spat on the Kirchner family. But you never spoke on human rights. Your comments were always: "She put botox. How much did he take? She's a thief ... ". Only such things ... Come on, get out of here! I've already expressed myself. - That was, is it? Did not the car fumigate him? Who told you? "She must have burned herself." She blushed herself. - It is possible. Do not you forget your head on the second floor in the hammer? And you, yours? Looks like you lost her the ability to sympathize. Your mare came out wild. - It's about tethering. From the hormonal imbalance. So much injection ... Back it up! Hold them firmly! Otherwise you spoiled the job. - You're on the move. Is it my turn? That ruined house ... One great man built it for his lover. On the opening day she thought that he had a friend, and burned it. Where do you find these stories? - It's true! And I've heard it. - Do you see? How are you, Mariana? - Me? Better than people with the house. When are you done with the pills? - On Tuesday. Then the cycle will come. And five days later that we begin with injections. Pedro told me, that you take riding lessons. No problem, until we switch the embryos. Then you will need to give up riding. I told you. You can not smoke. You can print out from time to time one glass of red wine. I, and like this, do not smoke. Hello. Can I help you with something? - Yes. I'm looking for Javier Rohas. Do you have an agreement? No. What's your name? - Mariana Blanco. Wait. Come in. Marianne Blanco is looking for you. Hello! Get in. - Thank you. Nice office. It's interesting to me. - What? I'm interested in what you're blaming the colonel. Ask him. Or is it your fear? - Why should I be afraid? Because in our country is full of monsters. Is it funny? - No, I'm not funny. When I'm upset, I'm starting to laugh. I can tell you the details. And I assure you, you will not laugh. - Do not. Five seconds. It's gone. You are the culprit of Francisco Blanco - the owner of the forestry company. Sorry. Have you studied me? - That's my job. And what did he discover? Am I dangerous? - I do not know yet. Good. what are you blaming? The materials are confidential. I told you. Ask him. - Very stupid! There is no smoking here. I'll only pull three times on the window. Please. You're stubborn! - A lot. It's hard to talk to a man, who can not speak on any topic. Do not you really care? who is your instructor? No. Do you want to have lunch together? I can not, I have a job. You are very irresponsible. Totally irresponsible. Total noodle! How can he not give me the plans! Tomorrow? Very clear, that tomorrow! Hear me, Santiago, to tell the client, that the plans are not with me, because that idiot, who are you? he hired, can not realize them! What is that? Anti-Personnel Mine. Are you joking? No. A friend brought it from Kabul. Your friends are abnormal. What so much! These are souvenirs, which cost $ 15. He needs to be kicked, to buy a mine! I will go. We have counseling. I just came for a bit. We'll see you at home. Thank you for everything, Don Pancho. Whats wrong with you? You look sad. Do you know the colonel? How do you know him? We've met for years. To my age, man knows many people. We live in a small country. How do you know him? I told you. We have known each other for a long time. He is a great man. That's why it's hard for me to ask you to interrupt the lessons after riding. Right now. The thing is, I do not want to to receive orders. I brought sugar and I put it on the table. Enough orders! You must be dropped! It's a titanic effort! Something really unique. Rest! - Yes. I'm hiding. Do not you hit your head? - I'll knock you on your head. And with the anti-personnel mine, if you keep ordering me. I have no jump! - You have! I'll just jump on you. Good morning. You're coming home. - There was traffic jams. You should have left earlier. How is Patito? - All right. Whats wrong with you? - And you? How are you going to climb? from that side? From the left! You climb the horse on the left! Do not forget it! Climb! Come on. And so! Where are your gloves? - I've forgotten them. You can not forget them. - But I forgot. Get off! Calm down. Stop the heels! Stop the heels! Straight up! Slowly back! That's right. No! First with a flat of! Sing them, I told you. Are you still angry, that I blew you? Do not be angry. You worked in the National Intelligence. Why did not you tell me? - There is nothing to tell. Have you worked there, or did not you? Answer me! I ask you! In the intelligence there were thousands of employees. But you are being tried. - That's right. I'm waiting for the verdict. What have you done? What are they blaming? I was answering for the security service. I'll get to you and I'll tell you something. My hands are not clothed with blood, if you are worried about it. So do you walk the girls? I do not go out with women like you. And I do not go out with cops. You are very fun! - Do you see? Did he talk to the coach? - Yes. And? He told me he was in charge with the security service. Is it true? - Yes. See. Between 1963 and 1966 they disappear many members of the left. The colonel's unity acted in the same zone, where those people disappeared. You claim that he is a transgressor? - No. I say that the colonel certainly knows where are those people. Is it cute? - Who? Colonel. - It's a good instructor. A conscious man, modest, sensitive. Sensitive ... So you like it? - No. People like your father paid you for the abominable thing. Why are you mixing my father? I know a lot about him. - Why are you mixing it? Do you know your father? Do you know who is actually? I'd be happy to be here and listen to tango. Two tequila, please. Eat the lemon. See now. The problem is not in the tango. The problem is, there are too many passive classmates. You are deterred from society, that's your problem. Good. Tell me what you like to the colonel? You probably already know, that he will go to jail. Let's eat after another. Two more, please! - Go get them. you want to command, eh? - And you? Do you like it or not? - Sometimes. It's seen. Do you love the tango? - No. I love the music from the '50s. You listened to her with the carer. - Yes. We were singing together. Do you have a housekeeper? No. - I do not believe you. Twice a week? One time? Do you have a housekeeper? Who helps you in the household? - Nobody. You are lying. Your mother? Do you cook? Do you do breakfast? I do it myself. - I do not believe you. And your girlfriend? Your wife? Who is your host? Are you interrogating me? - I have a detector of lies. Who's turning your house around? Answer me! Is your wife? Or your husband? You're a terrible liar! Will you be able to ride in this state? If you want to arrest me and hide me with lychees ... Policeman fetishist! It's nice. What's up, Mimi? Get up. My sister has come. - Horror! Come on, it's already down! - Come on! Do you want something? - One cafe. And you, Mimi? Give it a cup of coffee, to wake up! I'll cook breakfast. Dew? Has anything happened? No. - Dew! I do not want to burden you. Do not lie! I'm clear what you know. Otherwise I would not have been looking for you. I'll speak directly. - All right. I hear you. Look, I did not say anything! The gypsy accuses you. "It's pretty stupid!" Look, Colonel ... - 40 y. I'm being braked! Officers come in the day! - Understand me! I've always respected you! Prove it then! - Mr. Colonel! You were like a father to us in the barracks! Hello. What is happening? - My head hurts. We've all been on the run. I have nothing to do with it, What are you blaming me for? Please, listen to me. I want to clarify! Who is your friend? Nobody. I was seeing the policeman who asked you that day. You alone? - Yes. He said, that in your unit many people have disappeared. Is it true? I told him that I had nothing to do with it. And the dead? You were there, right? Why do not you help the investigation? I'm talking to you! I'm not a traitor. He said that if you cooperate, the judge will help you. Besides that you will help of the judiciary. What is the justice? - Simply judiciary. What are you talking about? I do not regret anything. I do not have to to ask forgiveness. Ask your dad does it regret anything? Who does it generally have? - Gather yourself. Do not order me! - Dress up and collect! Hello. - Hi. I am Mariana Blanco, We heard after noon. Yes. I'm here to convince you. Make an exhibition in your gallery? When will we understand? Pai ... - Do you know why I ask? I know, that of your fellow man I'm not sympathetic. I'm not my fellow. And I've come to you. And I really like your creations. - Really? You're very good. - Give me time to think. Are you serious? Yes. I want to leave with something yours from here. See you ... - Yes. No, I do not want an injection. I need to give you all the doses, otherwise it will have no effect. I do not care. You can not stop treatment. Otherwise it will need start from the beginning.

You're leaving, and ending! Do you have a play how much does it cost all this? I do not know if I want to to continue with treatment. What? - That's the truth. We both loved him very much. Not just me. It was a joint project. Yes I know. But I do not know if I want to continue. You are 42 years old. You do not have time. Come on. Get off. Come on, get him in the cash register. Keep away, Mariana! At least 2 meters! Come on. That's right. Slowly. Calm down. Watch out. What's up, Thomas? Enjoy horseback riding. Stand there, do not move. Patio! What happened? The horse was scared and unfortunately, she fell. Did not you have to help her? - These are the riding risks. Exactly for that reason interrupts with the lessons. Do you hurt much? - No. Did not they put you a gypsum? - The trauma is not serious. Two weeks should rest. And did they write any recipe? Here she is. Thank you. - There is no reason.

No need to read them. Just shake it and sign it on the last page. No, I'll read everything. Are you? - Yes. If at least once he listened to me, everything would have been different. It turns out stubborn. Like your mother. It's not nice to insult your mom. - Why? It's horrible. It's very normal to leave your family? Daddy! - He was freaking out. Sometimes he wanted to talk with everyone except me. With the driver, with the waiter, with ... Enough! You know, it hurt my head. I can not concentrate. I can not sign now. No need to read it! Sign, and ready! - I want to rest. Leave me the documents. Sign, Mimi! What will happen to you? Just ... Hear me what I will tell you! There are times when you need to do what you need.

Let's delay it for another time? - No. Now I come, as I said. - Well, we got together. Your slime is in the newspaper. - I look gorgeous, right? They accuse you of complicity! - Is that so? It does not matter. I filed a request against the newspaper. Is the written truth true? - What? That you gave those trucks? - Very clear. When a soldier sought something from me, Could I give it up? Did they know what they would use? - Normally, no! Daddy! I know you. Tell me the truth! Milichka, excuse me ... You can not talk like that to your father. Do not talk to him with that tone. Prove yourselves, what your father is has a sense of honor. What? - A sense of honor. The youth do not remember what we survived. She was very tiny. I'm hungry. I will go. To God ... - She is... Do not pay attention. Let's go eat. Better. Where are you going? - At the club. There is a competition. You did not tell me? - I did not see you.

What is that? - It's Saturn. Dalmatian? Can I hug him? - Come on! Show me it! - No ... See! See it only! It was not on the vigil. - I hate the dead. How did it go? - Do you like it or not? Good. Let's make a drink. Today we got the work for slander against the newspaper. As it should be! - That's right. Thanks to you! - It's a pleasure for me. With a Argentine lawyer - very clear, that we will receive. It was a serious request. I know the journalist. - From where? I know all of them. - Clearly. Good. Cheers. - Cheers. He was genius. It happened very quickly ... What a nonsense was that request! Yes. Typically ... Only empty stories. Why did you get quieter? What are you going to do? By doing that, you will take your father in jail. He will not go to jail. And the others who are? Rosita! - Here I am coming! Is everything okay? - Yes. And you? - All right. Everything is old. Get it. That is. There was no other. Ask your sister. - You have something. I mean, yes. Dear? Watch your children by the fire. Stay away! Here, sir. In the fire! - I took my handbag!
