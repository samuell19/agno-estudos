Harry? Did you try the fudge I made you? What? Oh, the fudge. Yes, it's good, Real good, verna. Oh, it's probably too sweet. Next time, I won't make it so sweet. By the way, my girlfriend and I Were having some friends in tonight for dinner, and I thought maybe, If you weren't too busy... Verna, I'd like to very much, really I would, but, uh, I'm afraid I can't... not tonight. Well, perhaps some other time. Yeah. See here, Lucas. This is the bureau of engraving and printing, you know, Not a friendship club. You've got a job to do, and until that bell rings... (Bell ringing) That bell? Just watch your step, boy. That bell. Hi, Jess. What you got in the bag, Harry? Fudge... Homemade fudge. And it's all yours. Enjoy. Oh, hi, Harry. Hey, pop, what are you doing here? I thought they retired you. I wanted a word with you. You got a minute? - Well, not really. - Okay, Harry. I'll tell you what pop, why don't you come on with me to my place? - We can talk there, okay? - All right Mind if I bring inky? She's in a family way. Kind of likes to have me close by. No, bring her along. - Good evening, Mr. Lucas. - Grayson, what the... I know I was supposed to wait around the corner, - but there wasn't any space. - Let's get out of here. - This yours? - Come on, pop. I'll explain on the way. Hold it! Official business, lady. Follow that car! Some layout. You got an Uncle with an oil well somewhere, Harry? No chance, pop. I'm just an ordinary guy working in the great society. Part of the antipoverty program, huh? (Laughing) Yeah. Say, Harry, if you don't mind my asking, how do you pay for all this? I don't. I mean, I don't mind you asking, And I don't pay for all this. You see, I got it all on 60-day approval. When it goes, I just tap another store, And that way I refurnish every 60 days. Doesn't cost me a cent. (Phone ringing) Sit down. Hello. Hello, Grayson. It's the limousine guy. Grayson: Mr. Lucas? What can I do for you? About the automobile... you've had a demonstration ride every night for the last two weeks. I'll tell you something, Grayson. It's got to be absolutely right, you know, Because we're talking a fleet deal for the whole department. But if you'd rather forget about it... Grayson: Oh, no, Mr. Lucas. What do you got in a red convertible? Red convertible... I'll get one right over. (Doorbell ringing) Excuse me. - Hi, lover. - Well, howdy, neighbor. I whipped up a little beef stroganoff for din-din, But it's much too much for little me. Well, listen, little you, will it keep till tomorrow? Oh, sure, lover. I'll be ready whenever you are. Furniture, cars, din-din. If this catches on, you could put the mint out of business. It's some system. You must be able to save quite a bundle. I've worked out a little philosophy for myself. I've learned to eliminate the necessities And live for the luxuries. And the golden rule... Live today and tonight. - You going out tonight? - Yeah. With that girl that runs the money-cutting machine? Verna? Oh, no. No, no, no, no. No chance. Verna's a... Verna's a nice girl, but she's the Come-to-dinner type. My one rule is never Have dinner with a female. But you just said you'd have dinner with that blonde out there. Oh, no, pop. She said "din-din." Din-din's a meal. Dinner's not a meal. It's a plot. It's, uh, meet the family. Next thing you know, it's mortgages on the washer. And then it's saving a little bit for junior's education. And that's why no come-to-dinner types for me. But, listen, I've been running at the mouth. What did you want to talk about? Well, I was just wondering if you could talk to Mr. link. I'd like to get my job back at the bureau. Pop, you're past 65. They retired you. - They'd never hire you back. - Oh, regulations. Look, I helped set up those presses. I serviced them for 20 years. And then, just when I was due to be made a printer, Some knot head looks at the calendar, And I find myself out in the street. You know, it ain't right. Just once, I'd like to get my hands on those presses. I want to print. Yeah, I know. But I'm afraid you're dreaming. They'd just never give you a chance. Doorman, please. Is it too much to ask? I'm a printer. I just want to print. Yeah, this is Mr. Lucas. Call me when my red convertible gets here. Thank you. Another new car. Fourth one in two weeks. Where do you suppose he gets all his money? Mr. link, I don't know what you're talking about. How could you possibly think you could get away with it? Mr. link, I haven't touched a penny... Do you think I'm blind? I saw it all. The car, the apartment. Look, will you believe me? I didn't take any... All right. I'll find out from accounting. All day, I've had them making a special audit on you. Look, do yourself a... Call them up... Ahhh! So now you're begging, huh? It's too late, Lucas. You are nothing but a... (Knocking at door) Ah, here's Mr. Maxwell. Come in. Come in. There he is. Tell him right to his face. His accounts are short how much? But, Mr. link, if I may have a word with you. Go on. Tell him what you found out. Well, sir, his books balance. - What? - Yes, sir. They're in perfect order. Not only are they accurate but very neat, too. I've been wanting to compliment you, Mr. Lucas, On how very nice you make your figures. Thank you very much. - Let me see those. - Especially your fours. You make them so nice and open at the top. Some of the other people around here... (Clears throat) I wouldn't want to mention any names but, when they make a four, You can't tell them from nines. And that can throw the books off, Because nine is five more than four. That would throw the books off. Terribly. All right, all right. Never mind this. Lucas, get back to your desk. Very nice meeting you. - Oh, thank you very much. - Love your fours. - Hi, Harry. - Verna. I made you some more fudge. Not so sweet this time. - Try some? - I'm afraid I can't now, verna. You see, the missing link's still on my back. Gosh, I'm sorry. Hey, I better get these off here. No, no, no. Thank you. I'll take care of it. All right, Lucas. This thing isn't finished yet, not by a long shot. There's something wrong around here, And I'm gonna get at the bottom of it. Mr. link, I keep trying to tell you, the car isn't mine... You think I was born yesterday. You may have fooled the boys in accounting, But you can't fool me. You're on the take, all right. And I'm gonna nail you at it. (Bell ringing) What's this? - Fudge. - I'm warning you, Lucas. You try any more of your smart tricks around here, And you'll end up behind bars. Jess, have some fudge. - Did verna make it? - Yeah. Not for me, pal. I still got some From yesterday... The worst. - Not the best. - Like a rock. Hello, ladies. The usual, as usual. (All giggling) Thank you. - Bye, ladies. - Bye! See you tomorrow, Willie. Hey, Harry, what you got in the bag... samples? Fudge. Here, you want some? Oh, no. Calories I got. What I need is cash. Then I'd really show you. These chicks, they don't even know I'm around. But give me a couple of thou, And I'd get a sports car and fancy clothes. I'd really show 'em. Yeah, but where do you get dough nowadays? You know, where? Hi, Harry. - Hello, Willie. - Calories I got. - Oh hi! - Could I have a grape twin pop, please? Harry? - Ah... the welcome wagon. - Hi, lover. Tonight I got here before the line started. You said we'd have din-din. Yeah, and the menu looks just great. I'm glad you like it. I was beginning to think you were on a diet. - You know where the music is. - Whoopee. You have a lovely view from the living room. Not bad from the kitchen either. (Cork popping) There she blows. - Ooh, it looks yummy. - It sure does. (Garbage disposal grinding) (Switch clicks, grinding stops) (Mouthing inaudible words) $50,000. Oh, no! - Mr. Lucas? - What? Shh, shh! How long are you going to be here? Just a few more dollars... Minutes, minutes. Hey, that's pretty good, huh? All right, hold it. Hold it. You guys fastened the trapdoor to the sewer in there, didn't you? Workmen: Of course. Guard: All right, come on. I'll show you the way out. Boy, do you get wild ideas. I know it sounds crazy, pop, but... thanks. But why wouldn't it work? We go in through the sewer at night, Start up the presses, run off the $50,000. Now, that's not gonna take long. - No, about half a minute, but... - See, it's that simple. Just you and me in that soundproof room for 30 seconds. And we're not stealing, just replacing. Now, look, pop, I wouldn't drag you into this if there was any other way. But there isn't. Can you see me trying to convince old weak link That I didn't steal that money? What a shame if, for the next ten years, You got your... din-din on a tin plate. But, relax. Count me in. Thanks, pop. All I want is for once in my life... To get my hands on those presses. I'll print up $50,000 that Alexander Hamilton would be proud of. That's the spirit, partner. But, look, we've got to move fast. They make the end-of-the-month audit next week... Oh, hold it. One catch, Harry. How we gonna get the plates? The plates... The printing plates. They lock them up in the safe every night. Okay, so we get one more partner... Somebody who can open safes. A safecracker? Now, where are you gonna find a safecracker? (Inaudible under machine noise) This guy, dugan, he gets out in two days. Best in the business... you never heard such references. - How'd you find out? - I asked a couple of cops. (Gate opening) Mr. dugan, I'm Harry Lucas. This is pop gillis. You'll have to talk up. Ten years in the mill, I don't hear so good now. - Uh, I'm Harry. This is pop. - Hi. - Do I know you guys? - Yeah, we just met. - I'll bet. - Um... - A friend told us about you. - A friend. - You get out Monday? - Huh? - We got a nice job for you. - No kidding. What doing? We'd like for you to open a safe. Huh? We'd like to have you open a safe. I got everything but the last word. What do you want me to open? Have you ever been to a baseball game? - Ball game, sure. - Yeah. You know what it means when the umpire says... (Mouthing) You're safe Out! Yeah, I'm getting out Monday. (Mouthing) Not out... safe... safe Oh, you want me to open a... (Harry clears throat) Will you do it? I already decided when I got out of here, I was going straight. Then you won't? No, I will. If I'm gonna go straight, I'll need some dough. What's my end? $2,000. - $2,000? - That he heard. We'll print up an extra sheet, all right? Only one more thing. To open a safe, I got to hear the clicks. I'll need a hearing aid. All right. Pop will pick you up here Monday, And we'll get you a hearing aid. - What'd you say? - Yes, we'll get you one. Now, uh, this one is a solid value. Belonged to a schoolteacher. She used it only on weekends. Ultrahigh power. If a pin drops two blocks away, he'll hear it bounce. What'd you say? Maybe you want to go for something more modern. This is beautiful. Seventeen jewels, six transistors... New style. Cosmetically smart for your facial coloring. - Only cost you 100 bucks. - I can hear good with this. We'll take it. We'll pay you in about a week. Oh, hold it. None of that "hear now and pay later." What did he say? Luther, if you're willing to wait an extra week, we'll pay you double. In new bills. (Mouthing) Double? In new bills? Harry, pop, you and I are old friends, right? Why don't we go in the back and talk this over sensibly? Well, we don't have to talk... You... uh... want the hearing aid or don't you? Yeah. (Pop mouthing) I know, pop, another partner. So we're all decided, correct? I get $2,000 just like dugan. No, no, no. That's kind of high. High? Are you kidding? It's a bargain. Obviously, you gentlemen need a business manager like me. Someone who's gonna advance the expenses... The hearing aid, getaway car, Gasoline, telephone, postage. - Postage? - Yeah. So? We just print another sheet. All right, all right. Let's keep it simple, huh? We just go in through the sewer at night, Print up my $50,000, plus... $2,000 for you, $2,000 for dugan, but that's that. You didn't mention who's gonna get you into the sewer system. What do you mean? You need somebody who knows the layout... What manhole to enter, what tunnels to take. - Didn't think of that. - Hold it. Luther to the rescue again. Leave it to me, pal. One of my regular customers is with public works... A Mr. Ralph randazzo. Oh, no. Not another partner. Come on. Have we got any other choice? Are you kidding? Ralph will do it. He needs the money... Plays the horses. Half of this stuff in here belongs to him. I just hope he hasn't hocked his phone. (Phone ringing) He's not here. - Hold it, Ralph, it's me. - Luther. I'm gonna need a couple more days. Never mind that. I... uh... I have a business proposition. Ralph? You seen the mixmaster? Just a minute. The mixmaster? Oh, the mixmaster. It had a couple of loose wires, So I dropped it off at the repair shop. I didn't want you to become electrically injured. It's being repaired, huh? Like the rugs are being repaired. Like the pictures are being repaired. I know where it is. It's at Luther's hockshop. He's got it all! We'd be more at home there than we are here. - Honey! - Tonight, I'm locking Lenny in his bedroom, So you won't hock him, too. Useless! Leonard... Go to your room and practice your bugle. I can't find it. I've looked everywhere. Oh. Well... Go practice tying more knots. Busy. Okay, Luther, now, what's my end? All my stuff out of hock now And two grand later. You got a deal. Oh, uh... just one thing, Luther. Them drains in that part of town are awful deep. We need what? - A boat? - A boat! Ralph, why specially built? To fit in through a manhole. Wait a minute, no problem. Tell him to meet us tomorrow at lunchtime. All right, tell him. Luther: Meet me at my place tomorrow. I got just the guy to build us a boat. A real expert... He knows everything about anything that floats. (Bell clanging) (Carnival music playing) That's your expert on boats? Yeah, come on. Talk to him, you'll see Pardon me, captain. Could we talk with you in private? Can it wait? I have the forenoon watch. We want to have a boat built. Oh, well, that's different. Mr. mcginnis! Relieve me at the wheel. I'll be in my quarters with these gentlemen. May I say that I've looked forward a lifetime To this very moment... When at last I'd be commissioned to construct a substantial vessel. Uh, won't you be seated? Feel free to smoke. Will you be blue-water sailing? Not exactly. Mostly inland waterways? Uh... yeah. You might call it that, yeah. All right. You want to sleep five. That's three state rooms, plus a... Captain, we don't want to sleep anybody. We just want it should fit down a manhole. Down a manhole. Into a sewer. You want to put my ship... In a sewer? Get your little... Mr. gillis! Captain, for $2,000? With that, you could build your own ship later. I know, pop... Another sheet, Another partner. Thirty-two inches. That's a challenging assignment. I'll construct the sections to be fitted through and assembled below. Perfect spot, huh? Nobody to see us going in or out, And the mint is exactly five blocks away. (Ice cream truck music playing) Hi, Harry. What are you doing down here? Oh, hi, Willie. What are you doing down here? Well, it's a regular stop... One of my best customers. She always buys a whole box of twin pops. You mean somebody lives on this street? Yeah, she's a painter or something. She's always in that window day or night when I come by. See? Now we're dead. You got any other manholes? This is the cream of the crop. That takes us right under the capitol. - Hi, miss Harris. The usual? - Uh-huh. Oh, my, don't you look nice today? There is something about a man in uniform. - Ninety-six cents. - What? Ninety-six cents. Oh, well... How about that? I forgot my purse. Tell you what. Why don't you come up, and I'll pay you? Oh... that's okay. Uh... I'll pay you tomorrow. I mean, you can pay me tomorrow. Oh, yeah. Sure. Well... See you tomorrow. You know, she wouldn't be at that window Friday night if Willie would... Means another partner. I know, pop, and it's the last one. Willie... All right, we're all set. Friday night Willie, keep that date with what's her name get her out of sight. That about locks it up. Harry, just one thing else. The boys and I were talking earlier, and it seems... The split ain't right. We get only two grand apiece, and you get 50. I get nothing out of this, the truth be known. What are you so... You see, everything will even up. Pop keeps the presses going an extra minute or two, And that way, we'll each get $50,000. It'll all work out fair and square. You guys want 50 grand apiece? Harry, baby, you got it all wrong. Look, we're not stealing. We're not taking money. We're creating it. $50,000! Hey, do you guys know what that means? Five times $50,000 is $250,000. Not times five, Harry... Times six. Sorry, Harry. Your $50,000 has to be exactly right... Perfect, in fact, to pass inspection. We need a professional cutter. Hey, how 'bout verna? She likes you. She'd help you out. Verna! Oh, I see. I just walk up to verna and I say, "Hi, there, vern. How'd you like to help us swipe a few hundred thou?" Just like that, huh, pop? Oh, come on, Harry. I've seen the way you operate. Two minutes with you, and vern will be begging to join us. No. No more partners! No more money. No more anything. I don't know why I let it go this far. I got boats. I got a business manager. I've even got a sewer guide! And all of you are screaming for more money. Well, I got news. The deal's off. I'm gonna call link and tell him the truth. It could mean prison, Harry. It couldn't be any worse than this. Uh-uh. Since we're no longer partners, use the pay phone. And you... put that hearing aid back. Don't worry, Harry. The big house ain't really so bad. Oh! Try for a job in the laundry. It's hot and steamy. It's better than The stamping mill. That's murder on the ears. Terrible. You could be lucky. Maybe you won't get too rough a punk for a cellmate. And you're not locked up all the time. You get to walk a little in the exercise yard. Not so bad. And the meals are okay. Knackwurst every Thursday. They give you all your clothes. You know them khaki suits? Of course, Harry, you got to forget about girls. But there's always pinup pictures. And every Christmas, A whole carton of cigarettes. Link. So, it ain't such a terrible thing. You do 10, 15 years, You're still a young man when you get out... About my age. Put that thing back on. - Put it on? - Yeah, on. We're back in business. Fifty grand and all? - What about the girl? - Who do you think I'm calling? - It's beautiful, isn't it? - Yeah. My grandfather was named after him. Thomas Jefferson Baxter. - Huh? - He was a judge. My father's a judge, too. - A judge. - Uh-huh. You know, I like to look at the treasury building, Even though it does kind of look like a prison. We're part of something terribly important to everybody. - Verna... - Yeah? It's late. I think I better take you home. Harry, you still haven't told me why you wanted to see me tonight. Well, uh... Listen, I know there's something bothering you. I've just been babbling along, Waiting for when you wanted to speak up. Verna, it's... It's almost morning. When there's a problem, A person sometimes needs another person. Well, we had this meeting tonight, And there are these friends of mine, And I don't know where to begin. At the beginning. - Fudge. - Fudge? Your other friends are helping. I will, too. Hey, verna, I, uh... I don't know how to thank you for that. You don't have to thank me. I feel that young persons should extend themselves, Particularly to a bachelor of one's own age. As you can see, the entire vessel can be assembled in less than a minute and a half. A minute and a half, huh? Okay. Dugan, did you get the truck? A buddy of mine at the "y" is gonna lend me his. He runs revival meetings. It's a great big job, And he says there's enough room in it for the boat and for every one of us... Shh! Willie, you got the okay to use yours? Just give me a yes or no. Okay, now, let's rehearse the whole thing. I got the backyard laid out exactly the way it's gonna be Friday night. Hey, gertrude, the ice cream truck's here. Want something? No, I got to watch my figure. What are them guys doing? Ah, bunch of nuts... Probably on goofballs. You really think so? Well, they didn't get that way eating fudgesicles. An electric eye... We've got to crawl under it. As fast as you can. Come on, dugan. Your hat! Now, dugan, this is the safe. You crack it. Get the plates out. Pop, you take the plates from dugan Over to the printing press, start up the press. Come on, hurry. We're on a time schedule. And the rest of us Take the printed money, bring it to verna, Who's at the cutting machine, like so. Money. Money. Money. Money. I got it. - It's a sex orgy. - It is? Yeah, sure. That girl there, she's the queen bee. And the guys, they're her slaves or something. I read an article about it in playboy. What are those people doing, mom? Oh, nothing, Walter. They're just playing. To me, it looks more like a sex orgy. Harry, listen, I think it's so nice... All these friends of yours doing this Just because they want to help you. Mmm, yeah. Well... oh, dear. I think it's getting late. We'd better hop a bus and get back to work. No, no, no, no, no. Let's go first class. Come on, hop in. Oh, Harry! Thank you. I'll get, uh... I'll get Luther to drive us. Okay. Hey, luth? Will you give vern and me a ride back to work? Oh, sure, Harry. Harry, something's come up. The boys and I were just saying that... Well, should I tell him? The boys and I were just saying how awful it is That poor old Harry doesn't get a thing out of this whole deal. I mean, we each get $50,000 apiece, But you, you have to give yours back, And it just isn't right, Harry. So, Harry, baby, As a favor, to make us feel better, deep in our hearts, We want you, to whom we owe so much... Right, boys? Should get $50,000 extra to have a lot of fun with. Am I right, fellas? Uh-huh. Well, look, fellas, if that's all that's bothering you... Then it's agreed. $100,000 for dear old Harry. And to make it even-Steven, $100,000 a piece for each one of us. That's a nice even number. Come on, Harry. I'll drive you home. - Wait a minute. - What's the matter? $100,000 apiece? No. No chance. Harry... I'm surprised. Here we are, wanting to give you an extra $50,000, And you don't want us to have the same, too. Shame, Harry. Shame. Luther... baby, why not make it $200,000? Or $400,000, that's a nice... No, no, no. $500,000. That's a half a million dollars apiece. Now that's a nice even number, too, isn't it, huh? Half a million a piece? You see, fellas, I told you. He's a born leader. See, we've been thinking small. He thinks big. All those in favor of half a million... Wait a minute. Hold it. Why don't you go for the big one? Make it a million. How could we be so blind? Harry's right. We get a million a piece. Oh, I love you guys. I really do. So flip... A million dollars. Willie? Your fancy clothes and jazzy sports car, huh? Captain, a big yacht to sail all over the world. Ralph, a string of racehorses And every one of them running in the Kentucky derby. Dugan... dugan! You wouldn't have to work anymore or steal, right? Luther... Why, you can pawn the pawnshop. You'll be a millionaire... A big shot, a tycoon. A million dollars and your worries are over. A million dollars and you can live Like there's no tomorrow. A million dollars. We don't meet tonight. I'll stay late at the office and check the guard's schedule. And tomorrow night, gentlemen, we print... Seven... Million... Dollars. Seven o'clock... guard 33. Another late night, huh, Lucas? (Yawning) Yes. I say if a man can't complete his work on time, he's a failure. Well, sir, with the audit coming up... And if you can't keep up now, you're gonna be in real trouble, When we speed up with the automated presses, next week. The automated presses. They're coming in tomorrow night, changing everything. One of my suggestions. Turning the whole thing around, changing the whole... Tomorrow night? Full automation. Willie, what's his name? Willie automated press. No, Willie, Willie... Right now? But it's supposed to be tomorrow night, and I'm not... Huh? Okay, okay. Tell pop I'll pick him up in 10 minutes. Harry, I can't. I don't have a sitter for my dog. She's going to have her pups any minute. Willie's on his way over? Okay. But I'm at a lodge meeting. Oh, it's got to be, huh? Yeah, yeah, I got my car. What? You'll have to speak up. Yeah. Oh, the truck? Yeah, I can get it. I'm on my way to my scout-troop meeting. I see. And Luther will pick me up. But I'm at my ballet rehearsal. I understand. Okay. Well, listen, I'll get a cab And I'll come right over to pick you up, all right? Hi! Come on, come on, come on! Willie, will you get upstairs? Keep your date. I couldn't leave her at home, Harry. That's all right, pop. The boat's in the back. Want it now? Not till Willie keep... Boy, oh, boy. No warning, no nothing. I was on my way to a scout-troop meeting. All right, all right. Now, first things first. We got... Who is that? Oh! Hey, everyone, say hello to my cousin Mario. Hello. I figured we could use him in a gang... a lookout. Well, you figured wrong. I tried to tell him, but he wouldn't listen. That's my cousin. He could use the work. You heard what Harry said. We can't use him. You understand? - Maybe you don't understand. - What do you mean? Unless he's in, I'm out. And without me, you can kiss the dough goodbye. Come to think of it, a lookout isn't a bad idea. - Okay. - It's settled. We got all the pot. Okay, but look, you... This is serious business. Is that clear? Is that clear? Harry? Uh, Harry, just a minute. Mario, uh... He doesn't speak English. What good is a lookout who doesn't speak... Shh! It's his first day in the country. A yell is the same in any language. I'll tell him how serious this business is. - You tell him! - I will. - Do it! - Mario. Sente, Mario, questa e serio. Senza giocare, capisce? Capisce. Bravo, ragazzo! Prego! Harry, she can't go out tonight. She just washed her hair. Well, you get right back up there and keep her out of that window. - But how? - How? - How? - How! Willie, that's kind of up to you. When we finish the job, We'll ring your bell, and you'll know We're all clear. Go, go, go. Do it. Go on. About the boat... the boat. Now what about the boat? I could have used the extra time for varnish. What did you say? He said he could have used the extra time for varnish! Not one word of English? All right, let's get started. Come on, come on. We could watch TV and... Have some popcorn. (Clanging noise outside) Hey, um... uh, uh... Wow! Oh, oh, oh, oh, ohh! - What was that? - What was what? Somebody barked. Well, well, well. Rafaele... - Si? - Arrivederci. Arrivederci. - Get over there. - Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow! Get off my foot, will you, please? - Look out, look out! - All right. Mr. Burton, your cape is caught. (Bouncy music playing) (Indistinct yelling) Ralph, will you quit pushing me, please? Will you grab it? - Why don't you... - Somebody catch this for me! - Let it go! - Let it go! Aah! I got it! (Indistinct talking) - Don't panic. - Put that up there. Bring that over here. - Don't you give orders! - Aw, shut up, captain. - I don't think it's going to close. - I don't think...

Luther and the dog. The dog... She's in the lobby! What are you doing here? Go get her! - Your feet, your feet! - I know, I know, I know, the feet, I know. (Mouthing inaudible words) Come on, fellas, it's about time to make the rounds. - There's some fresh coffee, Charlie. - Thanks. I wanna bring my kid over here and show him this thing. Very educational. You know who all them jokers are? Sure, who don't? That's Hamilton, Jefferson, And th... that's, uh... You know, what's-his-name. Boy, you sure know your history, bud. With a kid in school, you've got to keep up with things. Oh yeah. Lots of good stuff here for kids... The early bills and all. But mainly, what he'd get a kick out of Would be those dummies. They look almost alive, don't they? Except for that pasty-faced one. And just enough time for a smoke. That's one of the nice things about working nights... Gives me time at home with my kid. Oh, yeah. I mean, some fathers, you know, they got no time, -But I think I owe it to the boy. - Oh, yeah. I don't want to wake up one day, and we're strangers. Oh, no. I thought you already cleaned up in here. I did, but I gotta move that sofa back against the wall. - Give me a hand? - Sure. Thanks. (Cart crashing) - Hey, pop, here. - Inky! It's working... Just like you said. It's money... Real money... And bales of it. Genuine, beautiful, Wonderful, real money! And all tax-free! It is real, isn't it? That's right. Four and a half million dollars so far. Four and a half... Can you make it go faster? Go faster, faster! Harry, make it go faster. - Harry? - What? Could I have a word with you, please? Harry, somebody's making a terrible mistake. I didn't want to say anything before, but... The money's misprinted! No, no, the bills are fine, but they're making too many. They've gone way over $50,000. Uh, uh... well, we had to make a full run. We need the extra because, uh... In case we do misprint. Harry... You told me we were Just going to print up the $50,000 you lost. Believe me, verna, we need the extra money. Just... keep cutting. Keep cutting. Keep cutting. Cut! Cut! You heard him... cut, cut! Women! As if we don't have enough problems. Like worrying about the captain finding another boat. What do you mean? Well, the one we came in sunk... sank. He's out trying to look for a new one. Where? How the hell do I know? But, Harry, we're going way past the $50,000! It's all right, verna, we're almost finished. Almost. Cut! Cut! Cut! Cut! Hurry! Hurry! So they thought I was too old to handle this baby, huh, inky? Inky, we'll show 'em, huh, inky? Inky? Inky? Inky! Inky! It's happening! It's happening! Somebody get some hot water. What are you doing? What are you doing? Inky's having her puppies. We need a box. You can't use our money for that pregnant pup. My hearing piece... I found it. What's he doing, huh? Watch it. Watch it! Watch it. Here. There you go... All right, enough, stop the press. Not yet, Harry, we could make millions more! Millions! Harry! And I say those presses are gonna stop! Harry, please, don't stop it... Cut it out! Inky needs quiet. Print! Print! (Cloth ripping) Is that all that's left of Harry? 10:51... Well, I guess it's time to make another round. - How you doing? - Okay. Good. But everything is still a little blurry. We shouldn't have shut down so soon, Harry. We still got time to print another couple of million. Let's not push our luck. A few more minutes. Who knows when we'll be able to get in here again. We got plenty! Yeah, that's all right for you to say! But you're not out over $400 In expenses like I am... Plus postage. Mail that! All plates back in the safe. Harry, I have to talk to you. There's something very wrong! Verna, please, will you just do as you're told? I got enough trouble already. Please! All right, let's get out of here! I'm not leaving a mother in labor. Verna, pop can handle a dog. Why don't you help Ralph? Things are still a little blurry. Mr. randazzo... Oh, you poor thing! Okay. Out! Out! Everybody out! - Yeah, but Harry, I... - Out! Let's go, Mr. randazzo. Let's go, pop. But I can't move inky now. Look at the clock. I don't care. She shouldn't be jiggled around at a time like this. Motherhood is a sacred thing, Harry. I know that, pop, but the guard's gonna be coming by. Now, look... Nothing is more important than newborn life. No, sir, I'm not leaving here till she's had every last one of her pups. Pop... Go on, will you, Harry, and don't worry. She and me will make it out in plenty of time. - Any sign of the captain? - Nothing. Harry coming? - Right behind me. - We made it! Yeah, a lot of good that'll do us... no boat. Hey, something's coming! - Is it the captain? - Is it a boat? I thought only my ears were bad, but now I think My eyes are going, too. Gentlemen... I have returned. Welcome aboard. This is not the way we came! Captain, Captain, are you sure this is the way we came? If I could only see the stars, I could obtain an exact celestial fix. Celestial f... Hey, Ralph? Uh, everything is still a little blurry. Look, a street grating! Relax. I'll climb up there and find out just where we are. How long are you in for, pal? What street is this? Just a minute, I'll ask. That's right, sergeant... Wyoming, corner of 14th. Thank you. Wyoming, corner of 14th. - Thank you. - Anytime. Anytime at all! Who are you talking to? Somebody we know? The jolly green giant. Manhole to the port! Three in one port. Mr. navigator, - is it the correct one? - Could be. I shall make a reconnaissance. Aah! (Gasping) We're home. Faster. Come on, come on. Move it, we have no time. No time! That guy was scared? - That's all there is, Harry. - All right, start the car. All right, let's go, let's go. Ralph, you and lookout... Put the manhole cover back on. - Dugan! - Dugan! Dugan! Dug... the truck, the truck... Start your truck. Uh-huh. Yeah. Captain, take the wheel. (Captain laughs) (Engine sputtering) Choke it. Choke it! Loud speaker: Oh where will you spend eternity? Sinner, awaken! Repent the evil of your deeds. Your transgressions That pass in the darkness of night... - Shut it off. - I can't. Now you've busted the switch. Go back there and pull out the wire. Forget it. Let's get out of here! Your sins will find you out. There is no escape. Be prepared To stand upon the... (Crashing) Salvation awaits! Answer the call! Hear, oh, hear the masses... Join wills and sing, oh sinners. Sing for your salvation! * Satan's waiting * for you, sinners - what are they doing? - They're gonna give us away. We better lose 'em. * gold and silver all are worthless * Willie, let's lose 'em! Follow us! * shall we gather at the river * the beautiful, the beautiful river * gather with the saints at the river * and pass into paradise * and shall we gather at the river * Well, just don't sit there... Pick it up! The money, the money... Pick it up! Pick up the money. The money, the money! * salvation now awaits * Satan's waiting for you, sinners Children singing: * this old man, he played two he played knick knack * on my shoe, with a knick knack, paddy whack give the dog a bone * Oh, no! * this old man, he played two * Hold it, hold it! Where you going? To the Lincoln memorial. It's, uh... it's closed. Won't be open for another hour. He isn't awake yet. I don't understand. He's an old man. He needs his sleep. He's up now. Wait a minute. Give him, uh... Give him five minutes To dress and shave. Goodbye, ladies. Ohh. There they are... Way over there! * gold and silver all are worthless * at heaven's pearly gates * shall we gather at the river * the beautiful the beautiful river * gather with the saints at the river * Open it. Open it! Open it! Get up! Get up! Turn it off! (Music stops) - It got stuck. - Yeah. Did anybody follow you? I don't think so. (Siren wailing) (Speaking Italian) (Cheering and yelling) - We better get inside. - What about the dough? Shh! I'll get the dough. - You? The way you look? - No, the way you look. Not me... Mario. At least he doesn't look suspicious. Him? This? Two hours ago, We didn't even know him. I'll vouch for him. He's my blood cousin. Besides, he's Italian. Ehh! Surprise, surprise... A little celebration For my fellow tycoons. Lovely, isn't it? Mostly items I took in hock. Come on in here, baby. Luther, have you got something I could change into? - What'd you say? - You got another shirt? Sure, I got a lot in the shop. Take as many as you want, pal. I was gonna give 'em away anyway. At cost, that is. Hey... - Do you have any schweppes? - No, I feel fine. I'm leaving now, Harry. Um... well, I'll get Luther's car And give you a lift back to work. No, no. Don't bother. You stay here with your friends. I'll get home okay. I know I was kind of rough on you back there. That's wrong. That isn't what's wrong, Harry. You lied to me. Well, I told you we were gonna print some money. Harry... Printing money to put back is one thing... But this... This is stealing. We didn't steal from anybody... Legally. And who did we hurt? So eight poor guys are now eight rich guys. And printing $50,000 or $50 million... What difference does it make? It makes a lot of difference... to me. Verna, I've told you... Live today, there's no tomorrow. And, look, there's a whole lot of money, you know. I didn't do this for money. I did it for you! Harry, for four years I've worked with you... And I've worshipped you. Harry, I'd do anything for you. You know... I even let myself dream about us together. Harry and verna, two people working together And planning their future together... Verna, living is now. Grab it. And with that kind of money, You can do a whole lot of grabbing. That isn't the kind of living that counts. Your money won't buy you that. Look, verna... I'd do anything for you. Anything? Even if I ask you to give up the money? No. Why should you give up a million dollars When it's so much easier to give up me? There he is... Our glorious leader. To Harry, who made all of this possible. All: * for he's a jolly good fellow * for he's a jolly good fellow * for he's a jolly good fellow * which nobody can deny Harry, you're all right. Where's she going? Uh... she had to leave. Ehh, women... Forget about her. How's Mario doing? Okay. No problem. (Horn blowing) Polizia! - What'd he say? - Hey, buddy, does that go? Ah, guess so. Ooh... You shouldn't drink. Every time you drink, you turn green. LA moneta! LA moneta! (Yelling in Italian) * should auld... * acquaintance * be forgot * and * nev... LA moneta! (Speaking Italian) (Speaking Italian) (Speaking Italian) LA moneta, a partita! I think he wants his cut of the money now. The cheeky beggar! Ah, Mario. Finito? Rafaele, rafaele... (Speaking Italian) (Speaking Italian) (Yelling in Italian) (Speaking Italian) (Speaking Italian) (Speaking Italian) Harry: What did he say? Our money just went off in the garbage truck. My place is the last stop. From there, they go to the dump. The dump? They'll burn it! The city don't burn garbage no more. They take it out and dump it in the ocean. The money! The money! Get it, get it! The money! The money! (Indistinct yelling) Man: Okay, Max, take it away! Shove off! (Boat horn blowing) Well, if it isn't Mr. Lucas. What are you doing here? - Well... - Oh, yes, of course... The little matter of replacing the $50,000. I'm here to tell link about the shortage. Oh, I'm so glad, Harry. I knew you'd finally do the right thing and give up the money. I didn't give up the money. It kinda got away on its own. So let's be honest... I'm not here because I want to be. - Good morning, miss Baxter. - Good morning. Ha! Playboy. Oh, he's never gonna believe this story. Harry... You could go to prison. Oh, yeah. Din-din on a tin plate. Listen, Harry... We can go talk to him together. And then I can tell him about the fudge and everything. After all, it was my fudge. It might help. (Car horn honking) Harry! Wait, hold it! What are they doing back here? Boy, just in time. Here, I got something for you. Oh, hey, pop, thank you, but where I'm going, I can't use a puppy. It's the bills I used to line the box. Remember when inky had her pups? Go ahead, take it. $50,000 in new hundreds. You mean, the guys know about this? - And they still want me... - Uh-huh. Hey... Right back with the fudge. Now it goes in just the way it came out. (Bell ringing) I think I better get to work. B... but, verna... We could still see each other once in a while, couldn't we? Well, um... Yes... Oh, you could come over tonight... For dinner. Dinner? Tonight? Dinner. * Satan's waiting for you, sinners * but salvation now awaits * gold and silver all are worthless * at heaven's pearly gates * shall we gather at the river * the beautiful the beautiful river * gather with the saints at the river * and pass into paradise
