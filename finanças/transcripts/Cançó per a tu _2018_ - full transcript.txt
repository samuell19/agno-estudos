Laia, you just gave your farewell concert. What has been the key to the success of your career? I don't know… I never looked for success. Singing just makes me happy. To many, "A Song for You" is your best song. -Thanks! -Laia, please, one moment! Who did you write it for? A friend. Before today, you hadn't sung it in years. Why not? -Thank you. -Laia, please… Modern-day private law has a remote precedent in Roman law, the source of almost all our institu… Not all Roman citizens were equal. The patricians owned the land and were the only ones that could be senators. Meanwhile, plebeians had no power, but they had all the obligations. The situation got tense, the plebeians rose up… FREE UNIVERSITY, FREE SOCIETY …and Rome was paralyzed. Who knows what happened next? Gutiérrez? The Senate accepted that the decisions of plebeian assemblies had precedence over their own laws. What were those assemblies called? Plebi scitum. That's where we get "plebiscite". Great, Gutiérrez, excellent. That is all. Good afternoon. You're a nerd. Thanks. Have you got it? It's perfect. "Free university, free society." I don't understand why you keep signing as "Seneca". Should I pick you up after? I have class. I work mornings, don't you remember? When you're done, then. Come on. OK. In all this time, I've written a whole third part for Don Quixote. -I swear. -You liar! Really! I was after you for months, you hardly noticed. I went to the library just to see you. I've never read so much in my life! -David! Come on. -No, no way! Come on, you'll like him. He's a nice guy. Come with me. I want to introduce you to somebody. Laia, David. Finally, what an honor! Ignasi! I'll be right back. I hardly see him now that you two go out. I'm sorry I stole him from you. He'll be back. Time changes all. Soon you'll get tired of holding hands. Ignasi warned me you were a nihilist of love. Yes. Love doesn't exist. It ends, sooner or later. Love exists, but only for those who dare. Come. -Did you tell them we met with the POUM? -I was just telling them. -What's the POUM, a football team? -Yeah, in the regional league. They'll support us in the SEU elections. What good is the SEU to us? We need to form a new student union, one that's democratic. Are you nuts? What about the secret police? I'm done playing the fascists' game. I'm off, I have a tennis match. See you! Bye. We're trying to sleep! Quim! -"Free university, free society." -Here. "Free university, free society." Seneca? Who's that? Careful, Laia. This is dangerous. It's time to take action, to be able to vote freely. We want our own free union, our own university. We all have to participate, we all have to get involved. We need to be bold enough to make our own decisions. We need more people involved. Organization is key. -OK? -OK. -Until the 16th. -OK. The exam is tomorrow, isn't it? "The Empire"? Forget the Empire. Even if he's wearing a tie, Ibáñez is a progressive in disguise. If I were you, I'd study the Republic. Until the 8th. Thank you. A VOYAGE ROUND THE WORLD THE ROMAN REPUBLIC Roman law during the Empire. No more than 500 words. THE FOUR CATS MONTSIÓ STREET When I was a young kid I used to court and show off White espadrilles on my feet Handkerchief in my pocket And now that I am all grown up I have gone down an evil path Excuse me. Go on, continue. Farewell, dark carnation Farewell, daytime star The law captured me They locked me in dark prison The law captured me And I'll pay with my life Farewell, dark carnation Farewell, daytime star Excuse me. -Núria, how'd you do? -Like always. Just passed with a five. You? You're a stinking liar! -Why? -The exam! -You said you wouldn't study the Empire. -I didn't. I improvised. Hey, are you and Núria coming over for New Year's? I'm having a party at my beach house. Screw your party! -Hey! Aren't you dancing? -No, I don't dance. Aren't you dancing? We're waiting for Ignasi. Honey! How's it going? -Do you know where the bathroom is? -No, no idea. I'm off to find it. Be right back. -Did you try the butter ones? -Not yet. "Seneca." One, two… three, four… -Honey! For you. -Five… six, seven… eight, nine… ten, eleven… and twelve! Happy 1966! Happy new year! The rocket! The principles of this manifesto are just the start. Universities shouldn't form people with technical abilities but without an intellectual or moral inkling. SARRIÀ CAPUCHIN CONVENT 9 MARCH 1966 Universities should train men and women committed to freedom. So, we hereby constitute the Democratic Student Union of the University of Barcelona! Your man's a good speaker. You came. You thought I'd miss the big day? I thought you didn't care for politics. I don't. I like thinking for myself, not following slogans. You mean Ignasi's speech? It's one of the best he's written. Really? How are you? Hey, how are you? Thanks. Thanks. How are you? -Laia! -Hey! -How was it? -Great. I want to introduce you to Guillem. He works at Setze Jutges' record label. -Hi! -How's it going? So you don't just play the guitar, you also sing. Great. We need people like you, who want to change things. Guys! The cops are surrounding the convent. We need to leave. -Laia… -No. They expect us to leave. We need to hold out until the foreign press notices. Guys, listen! Use benches and anything you find to blockade the doors. We're staying here. Come on! 201, 31, 17. -Are you sure? -Yes, it's from a good source. -The police won't storm the convent. -Were you born yesterday? They're out there like hyenas! They'll storm us from all sides! I didn't come prepared to spend the night! Do you think this is a camping trip? Who would have guessed? You show up one day… The preppy kid in a mess like this. I know you're Seneca. You write the speeches for Ignasi. Why do you hide who you are? I like to read and write. I don't like making speeches, organizing people. -Somebody else can do all that. -What about the meetings? I'm busy. With what? Playing tennis? There's plenty to do besides being shut up in secret meetings. -What do you mean? -Don't you want to travel? No? There's so much out there to discover! When I'm done with studying, I'll travel far away from here. Wouldn't you like to change this country, make it worthwhile, instead of waiting for others to do it? That's why I write. You can't expect me to be someone I'm not: a man of action, like Ignasi. It's not about being a man of action. It's about being a part of something bigger, committing to something, not doing your own thing. I must be a loner. They're students. We need to get them out. We have no choice but to go in right away. Roger, get everyone up. Ignasi wants us. Maria, get up. Laia! Laia, get up! Ignasi wants us, we've got issues. Come on. The police say they'll storm the building. They'll write up Espriu, Tàpies and the others but they'll let them leave. It look worse for the Union delegates. -Worse? -Academic records, fines, possible university expulsion… We've got a couple of articles in the foreign press for sure, we can go. The police! The police! Hurry, run! -Sons of bitches! -Damn fascists! Ignasi! "Clandestine student meeting broken up by law enforcement." -Those assholes! -They could have said what we wanted! Look! Wow, the Frenchies! No. Look at this one, here. They want to reach a young and progressive public. That's our future. What do you mean? Don't we want to say out loud what we believe? Serious, committed journalism? Well, they say they're hiring. Really? Something's finally happening over here! Will you come tomorrow, since you can't go abroad? But I can't… I can't keep quiet. -I won't agree with everything they say. -Then don't keep quiet, that's the point! Sorry. Guys, I've got to go. Listen to this: "Upon seeing they would be identified, the presents decided to remain in the conference hall, trying to fool the authorities by claiming to be catechism teachers." DEMOCRATIC STUDENT UNION SECRET HEADQUARTERS That gets posted. OK, I think we're all here. Are you expecting anyone else? -Congratulations. -So, you heard! -This might interest you. -You found it! -How? -He's got contacts. -Will you translate it? -Yes. -Das Kapital! -Soon we'll be able to mimeograph it. Listen, Laia, about the audition today… You can't come? I got a call from Telexprés. I start today. That's great! I'm so happy for you! -Are you sure you aren't upset? -No, honey. I can take you. You don't mind? It would be a favor. Let's go. Should we begin? I would say… we have a new member of Setze Jutges! When can I listen to your compositions? How did you know? I haven't even told Ignasi. It isn't easy. How does Brel do it? Just by living, I guess. I don't know, be yourself. Talk about yourself, your world. But how? How do you do it? Taking risks, not controlling everything. Like this! Thanks… for everything. One, two, three, four, five. OK. Ten votes in favor and five against to support the strike in solidarity with the PSUC's actions Strikes… nothing but strikes! Can't you see we're wasting time? Did you hear Bandera Roja or Lliga Revolucionària? We don't have to be more radical just because they are. But we have to agree with whatever the PSUC says? Occupying the univ and making barricades won't get us anywhere! What do you think everyone reads essays like you? People only understand action, things change with direct action! Don't be arrogant, people are smart enough to know what they want. It's justice, not violence! For now, we all agree to stop classes, right? Well, let's start there. We'll talk about the rest, Ignasi. OK. The meeting's over, then. What? So. You didn't tell me! -Núria! -Your own concert! -It's no big deal. -What? Laia… You'll be famous! Come on, we'll be late. For once I'm on time… Let's go. -I can't believe you didn't tell me. -It's no big deal. -It's a concert! -Núria! What? Man, at least you could wait for me, I've driven you in my scooter! I figured you'd rather do your own thing. What do you mean? Since you always play Gandhi at the meetings… I speak my mind. I always have. Yeah, you've always had that luxury, unlike the rest of us. Ignasi, the world isn't fair, we know that. Isn't that's what fighting for, to change it? -Encore! -Encore! I'd like to sing one more. This one's new, I wrote it. This is my first time singing it and it's not finished, yet. I undress my verses My song Follows you Letting go to see If love is a battle A song for you Tears and laughter The fear and desire Of experiencing you A song for you A song for you -Congratulations. -Thanks. -Hey! -Hey! -How was it? -You're a star! Did you like it? You were great! Didn't you hear the applause? -Congratulations! I loved it! -Let's go with Pau. I was just telling them, I had no idea you wrote songs. -Bah… -Looks like you were born with it. Yeah, that last song really surprised me. I wasn't expecting it. And? Great. Really great, you sing… You sang really well. But? But… just the last song. With your own song, you were yourself. There was life in it. Songs need life. Something that maybe you can't identify, but touches you. Why don't you sing in your own voice instead of singing other peoples' songs? Seneca doesn't use his own voice, either. That's because of personal convictions. Not because he thinks he's not good enough. We have to celebrate this! -Come on! -Let's go! -Are you done, Ignasi? -Yeah, just give me a second. -How's yours coming along? -Police! Step aside. Hide everything you can, quick! Step aside! Alberto Claret? Yes. You're under arrest for insulting the Head of State and promoting sedition. Gather your things. Move it! Is there a problem, kid? Let's go! Let's see. Not this one, not this one… Here, Laia, try on this miniskirt. Núria, that's not my style! OK, your loss. Nobody'll look at you like that. Who do you want to look at you? Nobody. -Núria… -Nobody! -Nobody, Laia! -Come on, Núria! -Seriously, stop! You're being a pain! -Please! Who? How? Núria! OK, OK! It's… It's David. Does that bother you? No, no. I'm just surprised. You'll get him. You look really pretty. -Really? -Really. -Welcome. -Thanks. BOCACCIO MUNTANER STREET Laia, over there! Isn't that that writer you're so into? -What's his name? -Núria, don't point! La crème de la crème! Two Negronis. -We're looking for David Saladrigas. -At the reserved area, in back. But you need an invitation. -We're friends of his. -Yeah. Ready? I'll wait for the Negronis, go and get him. OK. To me, existentialism means always being the first one at the party and leaving last. -That way you can chose! -I didn't know you were coming. Come! Make some room. -This is Laia. She's a singer. -Hello. -And songwriter! -Wow! Yes. Anyway, we were saying, man makes himself, right? That's Sartre. We're condemned to be free… to decide who we want to be. In Critique of Dialectical Reason Sartre breaks with this existentialism and evolves towards… towards a Marxist vision… I wouldn't call it a break, he promotes individual freedom. Sartre gets it wrong by not criticizing the Cultural Revolution. Then Camus comes in. Mao isn't fighting for communist orthodoxy. He's just fighting to regain power. Jaime, I'll bring you Les temps modernes. In two weeks I go to Paris. -Paris? -Yeah. Want to put me in your suitcase? Say hi to Sartre for us! Excuse me, my friend… Excuse me. Laia! What's wrong? Nothing, it's Núria. -Are you mad? -What? Did I do something that upset you? Actually, you did. I don't like getting dolled up to come here so you can ignore us. I invited you, introduced you my friends… -Are we all supposed to talk about you? -You're an arrogant asshole. What do you want? What do you want from me? I shouldn't have come! I'm sick of this submission! We can't allow this. They tell us how to think, how to live… What is it? They arrested the chief editor at Telexprés. It's the only language fascists can understand, isn't it? We need to take to the streets for once and burn it all! He's gone nuts. Do we want a revolution or not? -Yes! -Yes! Hold on! Ignasi is right. We can't let the regime step on us like this. But do we want to act like they do? To fight like them, be like them? It's time for action! Let's take to the streets! Everyone to the rectorate! To the rectorate! -The rectorate? -That's how they'll listen, brute force! Burn flags and smash everything. Then what? What good has everything we've tried so far done? Ignasi, don't be naïve. Things don't change overnight. -Our time will come. -When will it be? You know perfectly well, they'll only move if we act! Ignasi! You're a damn bourgeois! That's your problem. You've got no balls. You don't need to fight for anything. You have it all. Your choice, David. Whose side are you on? With the Union… or against the Union? Screw your Union! ASSAULT ON THE RECTOR'S OFFICE AT THE UNIVERSITY OF BARCELONA With respect and gratitude, I want to remember Francisco Franco. Six of the accused were condemned to death. One car was hit full-on by the explosion. CARRERO BLANCO IS DEAD FRANCO'S CONDITION WORSENS SEVEN YEARS LATER Regional train from Portbou. Platform 9. -You look amazing! -Really? -How are you? -Good. -Any trouble at the border? -No. You know I never have trouble. Yeah… How is it going? Like I said in the letter, Ignasi worked his tail off building consensus in the Assemblea de Catalunya. He's a born leader. But…? But he's also stubborn. Since he fought with the PSUC over a few words in the manifesto, it's been impossible, not even Laia can convince him. -You know they're still together? -Yeah. You're our last hope to try and get him to listen. Without him, some groups are having doubts, and… it's a mess. I thought you made me come back for the manifesto. You're the only one he's always listened to. Not always. He knows he made a mistake storming the rectorate. He'll never admit it, though. All these years, he has read all your articles. In English, French… it doesn't matter. He always saw you as our best ideologue. Where can I find him? No! I don't care about censure! We're publishing it without pseudonyms or changes! I have to go, Gerard. We'll talk later. TELEXPRÉS Núria threatened to write you, but I never thought… You finally managed it: nobody tells you what to write. You asshole! Come here. I want to show you an editorial. A real "screw you" to Franco. Like your article in Le Monde about the Carnation Revolution. Spectacular. You know I've never failed you with words. I know why you're here. And? You won't change my mind. I won't waste one more hour arguing with those idiots. They think they are in the spotlight and want things done their way. Nobody said it'd be easy, did they? What did you expect from an assembly? Don't you remember the Union, all the shouting? Now it's different. This isn't a game. Oh, that was a game? I acted like a huge jerk. Let's go to my house. You're having supper with us. Laia will be really happy to see you. I'll open a bottle of wine. -Cheers. -Cheers! I'm fixing up an appetizer. Ignasi! Where are you? Hi. Hi. He came by the paper, can you believe it? I can't explain it with words, but It's almost like touching the gods… if they exist. The monasteries are so peaceful! I ended up spending about six months. With all this spirituality and roaming, I bet there's some Japanese or Indian girl that stole your heart. I can't say there wasn't. But no, nothing significant. I'll make coffee. Want any? -Yes? -Yes, please. I really envy you. Why? You've experienced so much! -And you haven't? -No, that's different. I've only travelled to sing. What's wrong with that? Do you still write songs? Not anymore. Everything's more professional. I'm sure you'll start writing again soon. -Let me help you. -Thanks. I'm really happy you're back. They execute people without a fair trial! CATALONIA ASSEMBLY BELLATERRA CAMPUS The dictator's on his deathbed, but they keep on torturing and killing people! The FRAP issue is important. Really important. That's why we've mobilized the foreign press. That's why we've done everything we can do. But we all know that we won't make them change their minds. Now we have to focus on what to do when Franco dies. That's where we can be decisive. Let's start there. We'll talk about the rest later on. He's right. One day When we look up We'll all see a land that says "freedom" One day, when we look up We'll all see a land that says "freedom" -Laia! -Laia! Please! Today, for a few hours, we've felt free. That freedom gives us the strength to go on. Freedom! -Freedom! -Freedom! Ignasi called. The FRAP prisoners… they were just executed. Those assholes! Above all, don't answer any questions. OK? Don't stop. Just walk by them. -She's here! -Laia, Laia… -When does the new album come out? -Please, say a few words. They just executed 5 political prisoners without giving them a fair trial. If a regime executes death sentences, it doesn't believe in justice. The disappearance of Francoism starts today. -Laia… -Laia, please. -Just one more question. -Laia, please, one moment. Are you nuts? You risk your neck at the paper, but I'm supposed to sing without saying what we all think? Laia, even though that asshole is dying, we have a 600 car and travel to France, this is still a dictatorship, damn it! Ignasi is right. Things are more dangerous now: they're afraid. You should disappear some days. Wait for things to cool down. We'll say… you were tired, you needed to rest. -What about the concerts? -You'll start singing again ASAP. You guys can go to my beach house, huh? Nobody'll look for you there. No. No, if I close the paper and disappear too, it'll look bad. You two should go. Are you sure you can't come? I'll open up. What is it? Nothing. You look pretty. You too. Do you remember that New Year's party? -Yeah… -That feels like ages ago. You didn't like me much back then, huh? Seneca! What you said to me about how songs need to have life, that helped me a lot. Life? What? Don't you remember? No. Really? I've been thinking about it for years and you don't even remember? Well, I forgive you. You still owe me a dance. Yes, you do! I cried so much Because we didn't realize it I felt your cares Scratching… Hi. …All my skin Feel that those kisses… Hi. …Hurt so much unintentionally Feel that the light Abandoned us in the darkness Without noticing… You're the woods, you're the sea And this house You are the beginning and the end Of a path I haven't chosen A song for you I won't say your name Prisoners of love Slaves to the impossible A song for you A song for you For you Did I wake you? I wasn't able to finish it until today. Now the lyrics just come to me. I like it. Are you all right? I missed you so much! Do you still think love ends sooner or later? Will you come with me when this is over? Hello? OK. Laia! We must go back to Barcelona. They weren't just after you, Laia. They'd been watching him. They closed the paper. They're accusing Ignasi of treason. You can't stay here. You need to hide again. No. Everybody's been asking about Ignasi. Journalists, editors… They're organizing the first newspaper strike. Thanks, Núria. Count on me for whatever you need. Thanks, really. Did something happen? What do you mean? With David. You guys act different. That doesn't matter, now. I know, but… not everyone finds what you two have. Attention, Spaniards. A message from the Information and Tourism Minister, Mr. León Herrera y Esteban. It is with deep regret that I read the following statement. "20 November 1975. The civil and military branches report at 5:25 a.m. that according to his doctors, His Excellency the Generalissimo just died from cardiac arrest, a consequence of his septic shock from peritonitis." Now what? Now's the time to be brave. The only way to help Ignasi and the others is by being brave. Moving forwards. We'll organize a protest even if they ban it. A march and a protest concert to celebrate who we are and what we want to be. With a clear, concise slogan. "Amnesty and freedom." -Amnesty and freedom! -Amnesty and freedom! Damn it, Ignasi! How did you do it? I'm a damn bourgeois with contacts. Don't you remember? Where's Laia? There's a protest concert tonight. Everyone's performing, she wants to be there. Only you can convince her not to. Don't tell her. -Until the concert's over. -They might arrest her! There's still an arrest warrant out. No, no! We can't rob her of this moment. It's important to her. Ignasi… -These days-- -David, whatever happens, happens. -Laia, it's all set. -Perfect. Do you plan to perform? Yes. Why, because you think you owe it to Ignasi? No. No, it's not for Ignasi. Or for you. Or me. I'm doing it for us all. What are you afraid of? Losing you again. You won't come with me, will you? I'll stay… if you want. Forever. You were born to fly. I like that about you, I don't want to change you. I'll wait for you. Amnesty and freedom! Laia, it's time. Are you sure you want to? Laia! Amnesty and freedom! I wake up at night And I remember Your smile You'll forget me Time changes all A song for you You thread an invisible thread Our days In these lines A song for you A song for you Guillem! Nothing happened! Did you hear them chanting? They're beautiful! Ignasi? How…? Is he OK? Ignasi. Ignasi! LONG LIVE CATALUNYA AMNESTY Hiding from the press? You're a real star. You haven't changed. Neither have you. I saw… Ignasi's electoral campaign. Politics, you know. Somehow, I knew you'd come. I liked seeing you. Me too. Really. David!
