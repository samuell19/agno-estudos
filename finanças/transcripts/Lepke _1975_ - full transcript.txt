NORTH AND SOUTH AMERICA AND ALL THE SHIPS AT SEA. LET'S GO TO PRESS. THIS IS WALTER WINCHELL. HALF AN HOUR AGO, OUR CITY, ALREADY INCREDULOUS AT THE NEWS OF LAST WEEK'S RELEASE ON BAIL OF LABOR AND NARCOTICS RACKETEER AND RUMORED MASTERMIND OF THE SO-CALLED BROOKLYN MURDER CORPORATION LOUIS LEPKE, WAS FURTHER OUTRAGED BY THE COLD-BLOODED MURDER OF LAW-ABIDING STOREKEEPER JOSEPH ROSEN. WHEN WILL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES BRING HIM TO JUSTICE? [RADIO SHUTS OFF] COME HOME NOW, DARLING. PLEASE. TWICE A WIDOW IN ONE LIFETIME IS TOO MUCH. BERNICE, LEAVE HIM. HE IS AN EVIL MAN. I ONLY KNOW THE PART OF HIM THAT LIVES WITH ME AND DAVID HERE IN THESE ROOMS. IT'S NOT THE MAN THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT. HOW CAN YOU LIVE WITH ONE HALF OF A MAN AND PRETEND THE REST DOESN'T EXIST? WHY NOT? I'M NOT KIDDING MYSELF. I'M NOT TRYING TO DEFEND HIM, BUT IF THERE'S ANY GOOD IN HIM, THAT'S THE PART I'VE GOT. IT'S A LOT MORE THAN I HAD BEFORE, BELIEVE ME. MY DAUGHTER IS A WHORE, THAT'S WHAT. SHE IS BOUGHT BY THE JEWELRY, THE FURS, THE PRESENTS. YOU'RE A WHORE-- A FILTHY WHORE! PAPA, I WISH I WAS. I WISH I WAS A WHORE. THEN I COULD WALK OUT OF HERE WITH YOU. BUT I CAN'T. I CAN'T LEAVE HIM, PAPA. I LOVE HIM. I THINK WE SHOULD SEND DAVID TO A SCHOOL OUT OF TOWN. MAYBE MIAMI. YES, MIAMI. HE LOVES THE BEACH SO MUCH. WHAT GOOD WILL THAT DO? WELL, AT LEAST HE WON'T BE AROUND TO HEAR ALL THE DIRT THEY'RE HEAPING ON ME NOW. BERNICE, I WANT YOU TO GO, TOO. BUT YOU'RE STAYING HERE, AREN'T YOU? WHY SHOULD WE LEAVE AND YOU STAY? WE CAN AFFORD TO GO ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD ALL TOGETHER, LOU. YOU'LL BE SAFE THERE, BERNICE. I'VE ALWAYS TAKEN GOOD CARE OF YOU, AND I ALWAYS WILL, BUT I CANNOT TAKE CARE OF MY BUSINESS WHEN I'M FAR AWAY. SO THAT'S THE WAY IT'S GOING TO BE. HOW CAN YOU WANT TO STAY HERE? YOU CAN'T EVEN PICK UP THE PHONE WITHOUT HEARING A TAP ON THE LINE. WHAT KIND OF LIFE IS IT? MY LAWYERS WILL PROTECT ME. DON'T WORRY. IT'S NOT THE LEGAL THING I'M WORRIED ABOUT. LOU, DON'T MAKE US GO. WE'LL NEVER BE THE SAME IF WE'RE SEPARATED. OH, NOT FROM YOU, TOO! I GOT A HEADACHE. I'M GETTING AN ASPIRIN. LOU, LISTEN TO ME. I WANT TO KNOW! LOU, TELL ME-- WHY CAN'T WE ALL GO AWAY TOGETHER? WHAT IS IT THAT KEEPS YOU HERE, THAT YOU NEED MORE THAN YOUR FAMILY? WILL YOU STOP YELLING? YOU'RE GOING TO WAKE DAVID. I DON'T CARE WHO HEARS, AS LONG AS YOU DO. I JUST WANT YOU ALIVE AND WITH US. I DON'T CARE ABOUT ANYTHING ELSE. WILL YOU STOP IT? DON'T ARGUE WITH ME! I'M NOT LEAVING. THIS IS THE ONE. OH, GROSS, FOR CHRIST'S SAKE. [KNOCK ON DOOR] IS THAT THE BOSS? MUST BE. HE'S EARLY. BOSS, IS THAT YOU? [MUFFLED VOICE] YEAH, YEAH. ANGELO. [MACHINE GUN FIRING] [MACHINE GUN FIRING] Lepke: LOOK WHAT THEY DONE. THOSE GUINEA BASTARDS. THEY STOLE MY DOPE! LEP, YOU GOT TO DISAPPEAR. WHAT? DO YOU WANT TO WIND UP LIKE THESE BASTARDS? IT'S MORE THAN THE WOPS. IT'S HOOVER. IT'S WINCHELL'S PUBLICITY. IT'S THE WHOLE PICTURE. SOME SECOND-RATE HOOD WILL COME AFTER YOU TO GET THE COPS OFF HIS OWN BACK. YOU GOT TO TAKE A POWDER. I'M NOT GOING ON THE LAM. COME ON! THIS IS AL FURSTENBERG, OUR PROJECTIONIST. THIS IS MR. JOE HEIMS. CAN I SHOW YOU THE ROOM? YOU BETTER. GURRAH, WHY DO YOU THINK I'M ON THE LAM? TO STAY OUT OF JAIL. WHAT DO YOU CALL THIS PLACE? IT'S BETTER THAN JAIL. WHAT AM I GOING TO DO HERE? YOU CAN SEE MOVIES-- FREE. [SIREN AND GUNSHOTS] Man: EVERYTHING ALL RIGHT? [HIGH-PITCHED VOICE] GO RIGHT ON IN. WHAT'S SHOWING TODAY, BABY? AW GET ON IN THERE. WHO IS HE? OH. HE'S OUR NEW BUTTON-- KID TWIST RELES. HE TAKES CARE OF THE PROJECTIONISTS WHETHER THEY LIKE IT OR NOT. HE'S THE GUY THAT GOT US THIS DUMP. I HOPE YOU'RE PLEASED, MR. LEPKE. YEAH. IT'S ALL RIGHT. WE COULD DO WITH BETTER PICTURES. MAYBE YOU GOT A LOVE STORY INSTEAD OF THIS GANGSTER SHIT. O.K. THANK YOU. SIT DOWN, RELES. SIT DOWN. [TIRES SQUEAL, SIREN BLARING] [GUNSHOTS ON SCREEN] HEY, RELES, YOU SURE THIS PLACE IS SAFE? SURE. I CHECKED IT OUT. TWO TICKETS, PLEASE. I'M SORRY. WE'RE ALL SOLD OUT. WHAT DO YOU MEAN? LADY, I SAW THREE GUYS GO IN. WHAT'S GOING ON? [GUNSHOT] AAH! GET MOVING! I'LL COVER YOU. O.K. I'LL GET THE CAR. YOU SON OF A BITCH! YOU GOT THE MONEY? YEAH, BOSS. IT'S DRYING UP. WHY? NO ONE MOVED IN ON ME WHEN I WAS OUTSIDE. NO ONE'S DOING IT WHILE I'M ON THE LAM. DEWEY IS PRESSING THE BOYS. HE'S PUT A REWARD OUT FOR YOU. IT'S ALL OVER TOWN. EVERY JERK HAS GOT YOUR PICTURE HANGING IN HIS KITCHEN. 25 GRAND. IS THAT ALL HE THINKS I'M WORTH? YOU SAVED HIS LIFE ONCE, TOO. I HATE TO TELL YOU, BOSS, BUT THAT STUPID HOOVER IS ONLY PUTTING UP 5,000. THAT'S ALL HE CAN AFFORD-- A NICKEL A SHTIKL. 5 GRAND. I GUESS HE WANTS A PIECE OF ME. WHAT PIECE? MY PUTZ, I GUESS. DON'T GIVE IT AWAY. [SIREN] GET OFF. GET OFF! [MUSIC PLAYING] RELES. YEAH. GET DOWNSTAIRS. MRS. WALLER, MR. SMITH. [TURNS OFF RADIO] IT'S ALL RIGHT. I LIKE IT. THANK YOU. MY PLEASURE. DON'T YOU MISS YOUR WIFE? YOU KNOW I DO. DO I LOOK A LITTLE SOMETHING LIKE HER? NOTHING. [ICE CLINKS IN GLASS] HOW LONG HAS IT BEEN SINCE YOU'VE SEEN HER? TOO LONG. OOH. I'M SO GODDAMNED HOT. WILL YOU STOP ACTING LIKE A DIRTY TRAMP? GOOD NIGHT. [RADIO CLICKS ON] [MUSIC PLAYING] GOOD MORNING, MR. AND MRS. NORTH AND SOUTH AMERICA AND ALL THE SHIPS AT SEA. LET'S GO TO PRESS. ON THIS SIZZLING JULY 10, 1939, THE RACE TO BRING HUNTED RACKETEER FUGITIVE LOUIS "LEPKE" BUCHALTER TO THE HANDS OF JUSTICE IS KEEPING OUR CITY OF NEW YORK BUSY. LITTLE OLD LADIES HAVE DISCOVERED A NEW PASTIME-- SEARCHING FOR LEPKE IN EVERY DARK CORNER OF EVERY ATTIC AND CELLAR UPTOWN AND DOWNTOWN. THE PHONE CALLS PILE UP AT POLICE HEADQUARTERS. AT THIS HOUR, THEY HAVE LEADS ON A BEARDED LEPKE, A BALD LEPKE, A MUSTACHIOED LEPKE. EVEN A LEPKE WITH HORNS HAS BEEN SEEN. BUT THE REAL RIVALS IN THIS HISTORIC CONTEST BETWEEN GOOD AND EVIL ARE THE MEN OF HOOVER'S FBI, WHO WANT HIM ON NARCOTICS CHARGES, AND THE NEW YORK STATE PROSECUTOR TOM DEWEY, WHO HAS ANNOUNCED HE CAN PUT HIM AWAY FOR 500 YEARS. [KNOCK ON DOOR] [COCKS GUN] AW, SHIT. HERE. WHAT IS IT? IT'S URGENT. ALL RIGHT. GET OUT OF HERE. LEP. WELL, WHAT IS IT? Lepke: THE SYNDICATE WANTS TO SEE ME. YOU'RE NOT GOING. YOU KNOW THE RULES. I GOT TO SHOW UP. THERE'S ONE THING I WANT TO DO FIRST-- SEE BERNICE AND THE BOY. LEP, YOU CAN'T! I WANT TO SEE BERNICE AND THE BOY... TODAY. [HONK] THIS WAY, BERNICE. LOU? MOM. LOU? BERNICE. OH, I'VE MISSED YOU SO. IT'S BEEN SO LONG. DAVID. LOOK HOW BIG YOU GOT, DAVID. YOU'RE GOING TO BE AS BIG AS ME PRETTY SOON. TAKING GOOD CARE OF YOUR MOTHER? YEAH. LOU, WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN TO YOU? OH, NOTHING. EVERYTHING'S GOING TO BE FINE, JUST THE WAY IT USED TO BE. BELIEVE ME. COME ON. CHEER UP, WILL YOU? THAT'S IT. THERE'S SOMEBODY OUT THERE! LEP! WE GOT TO GET OUT OF HERE! COME ON. OH, MY GOD. Gurrah: I DUCKED ONE TAIL, BUT THEY MUST HAVE HAD ANOTHER ONE. HURRY UP! AAH! AAH! [GUNSHOTS] [CAROUSEL MUSIC PLAYING] AAH! GET IN. YOU'RE GETTING OUT OF HERE! WELL, WHAT ABOUT YOU? NEVER MIND ABOUT ME! GURRAH! RELES! RELES, GET OVER HERE! TAKE THEM HOME! GET THEM OUT OF HERE! DON'T GO BACK THERE! [TIRES SQUEAL] GURRAH! GURRAH! GURRAH! LEP... WE MADE IT TO THE TOP, DIDN'T WE? IF I WAS A WOP, YOU WOULDN'T FRISK ME. HEY, MARIO, CHE FAI? WHAT ARE YOU DOING, FRISKING MY FRIEND? COME ON IN, JUDGE. COME ON IN. COME ON. SIT DOWN. HAVE SOME PASTA. HOW MUCH? I DON'T WANT NO PASTA. WELL, THIS IS A SWITCH-- THE JUDGE BEING JUDGED. NICE TO SEE YOU, LEPKE. YOU MEAN ALIVE, DON'T YOU? ALL RIGHT. WHAT DO YOU GOT IN MIND? EVER SINCE YOU BEEN ON THE LAM, BUSINESS HAS BEEN BAD. SO WHAT'S THE VERDICT? YOU GOING TO POUR CEMENT AND DROP ME IN THE RIVER? HA HA HA! HA HA HA! WE'RE YOUR FRIENDS, AND WE RESPECT YOU, AND WE WANT TO PROTECT YOU, BUT IN RETURN, YOU HAVE TO PROTECT US, TOO. AND HOW CAN I PROTECT YOU? YOU GOT A CHOICE. YOU EITHER GIVE YOURSELF UP TO THE D.A. OR GIVE YOURSELF UP TO THE FEDERALS. IT'S UP TO YOU. I DON'T WANT TO ELECT DEWEY, SO I'LL TAKE THE FEDS. I THINK YOU MADE A GOOD CHOICE, LOUIS. COME ON. LET'S HAVE SOME VINO. I'M GOING TO MISS YOU, LOUIS. LIKE YOU MISS GURRAH? YOU'RE A LIAR, LUCKY-- NOTHING BUT A GODDAMN LIAR. GO AHEAD. KILL ME. YES. KILL YOU. I SHOULD... BUT THE ORGANIZATION NEEDS YOU. THEY NEED YOU IN STIR TO GET THE HEAT OFF. YOU'RE GOING TO DIE IN-A JAIL, LOUIS, NICE AND SLOW. I'M GOING TO ENJOY IT. I'LL REALLY ENJOY IT. I'LL NEED SOMEBODY TO MAKE A DEAL WITH THE FEDS. WHO WILL STAND FOR ME? THE ORGANIZATION'S ALREADY TAKEN CARE OF THAT. RIGHT, ALBERT? I TALKED TO WALTER WINCHELL. HE'S CLOSE TO HOOVER. HE SAYS HE CAN MAKE A DEAL FOR YOU. LEPKE. YEAH. ALL RIGHT. GO GET HIM. I'M READY FOR HIM. MR. BUCHALTER, MR. WINCHELL. I THINK HE'S GOT GOOD NEWS FOR YOU. THE GREAT WALTER WINCHELL, HUH? VOICE OF THE 20th CENTURY. HEY, OUR BEST COGNAC FOR MR. WINCHELL OVER HERE, HUH? I FIGURED YOU'D BE TALLER. WHY DON'T WE DRINK TO THAT DEAL YOU MADE, O.K.? IT'S SET FOR TOMORROW. DEWEY DOESN'T TOUCH ME, RIGHT? WELL, HOOVER GAVE HIS WORD HE WON'T TURN YOU OVER TO NEW YORK. HOW MANY YEARS? 12 AT THE MOST. 12. HE'S ASLEEP. HELLO, LOU. BERNICE. COME IN. YOU'RE TREMBLING. COME ON, SIT DOWN. SPEND THE NIGHT WITH ME, PLEASE. LOU, I WOULD HAVE... I WOULD HAVE DONE ANYTHING TO HAVE A LIFE WITH YOU... BUT YOU SHUT ME OUT. WE HAVEN'T BEEN TOGETHER FOR TWO YEARS. I JUST CAN'T UNDERSTAND THAT. I DON'T WANT TO SAY GOOD-BYE THIS WAY. THEN GO. THEN JUST GO. CLOSE THE DOOR. MR. HOOVER, THIS IS LEPKE. 12 YEARS, NO NEW YORK RAP. THAT'S WHAT WE AGREED. THAT WILL BE UP TO THE JUDGE. WHAT ARE WE WAITING FOR? THE SOONER I GET THERE, THE SOONER I GET OUT. WILL THE ACCUSED PLEASE RISE FOR SENTENCING? SO THAT THE RECORD IS CLEAR, I WISH TO STATE THAT THE DEFENDANT, LOUIS BUCHALTER, IN ADDITION TO HIS SENTENCE OF 12 YEARS FOR CONSPIRACY TO VIOLATE THE NARCOTICS LAW, WILL SERVE AN ADDITIONAL TWO YEARS ON THE ANTITRUST INDICTMENTS. AT THE COMPLETION OF THOSE 14 YEARS, HE WILL BE REMOVED FROM LEAVENWORTH PENITENTIARY AND TURNED OVER TO THE STATE OF NEW YORK FOR FURTHER PROSECUTION. THIS COURT IS ADJOURNED. HE'LL BE IN PRISON FOR THE REST OF HIS LIFE MAYBE THAT'S FOR THE BEST. DON'T LOOK AT ME LIKE THAT, BOBBY. WHEN HE WAS WITH ME, I SHUT MY EYES TO THE TRUTH. I NEVER TRIED TO CHANGE HIM WHEN IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN POSSIBLE. NOTHING COULD EVER CHANGE LOU. I'LL NEVER KNOW, WILL I? [TELEPHONE RINGS] WILL YOU GET THAT FOR ME? I DON'T WANT TO TALK TO ANYONE. [KANE] HELLO. SHE CAN'T COME TO THE PHONE. THIS IS ROBERT KANE. YOU CAN TELL ME. THANK YOU. WHAT IS IT, BOBBY? WHAT'S THE MATTER? THAT WAS THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE. THEY RELEASED HIM FROM LEAVENWORTH AND TURNED HIM OVER TO NEW YORK. I EXPECTED IT. NOW THEY'LL CHARGE HIM WITH MURDER. RELES WITH HIS GODDAMN BIG MOUTH HAS BEEN TALKING ALL OVER TOWN. RELES. ABE RELES, HUH? WHAT ARE YOU WORRIED ABOUT? HE'S GOING TO TAKE A LEAP. HE'S DEAD ALREADY. NOBODY'S GOT ANYTHING ON ME. THEY MUST HAVE SOMETHING, OR YOU WOULDN'T BE HERE. A CANARY OR SOMETHING?

WHAT WERE HIS EXACT WORDS? CAN'T HEAR YOU. SPEAK UP. SPEAK. HE SAID, "I WANT ROSEN HIT. I WANT THAT SON OF A BITCH DEAD." [CROWD MURMURING] Judge: ORDER. NOW TELL US, MR.

"SURELY GOODNESS AND MERCY SHALL FOLLOW ME "ALL THE DAYS OF MY LIFE, "AND I SHALL DWELL IN THE HOUSE OF THE LORD FOREVER." [CLOCK TICKING] [EXHALES] GOOD EVENING, MR. AND MRS. NORTH AND SOUTH AMERICA AND ALL THE SHIPS AT SEA. LET'S GO TO PRESS. THIS IS WALTER WINCHELL WITH THE LATE NEWS. MOST AMERICANS TODAY ARE CONCERNED WITH THE WAR IN THE PACIFIC AGAINST JAPAN, BUT, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, I WOULD LIKE TO REPORT TO YOU THIS EVENING ON AN EVENT OF MAJOR SIGNIFICANCE ON THE DOMESTIC SCENE-- ONE WHICH MANY AMERICANS BELIEVED WOULD NEVER HAPPEN. TONIGHT, MARCH 4th, SATURDAY NIGHT, THE LIGHTS WERE ON IN THE DEATH CHAMBER OF SING SING PRISON, REFERRED TO AS THE DANCE HALL BY THOSE IN THE KNOW. AT 11:30 P.M., LOUIE BUCHALTER, BETTER KNOWN TO YOU AS LEPKE, AND TWO OF HIS HENCHMEN, MENDY WEISS AND JOE CAPONE, WERE ELECTROCUTED FOR THE MURDER OF JOSEPH ROSEN. LEPKE IS THE FIRST OF THE GANG LORDS OF THE SO-CALLED SYNDICATE TO BE EXECUTED. TO ME, IT REPRESENTS A GIANT STEP FORWARD IN OUR WAR AGAINST THE CRIMINALS, MOBSTERS, AND PUNKS WHO DEFILE OUR GREAT AND GOOD LAND.
