[eerie music] [♪♪] [radio static] [screams] [dramatic music] [♪♪] [panting] [screams] [gunshot] [screaming] [gunshot] [dramatic music] [♪♪] [softly sobbing] [door closes] [dramatic music] [♪♪] [crying] [dramatic music] [♪♪] He won't get far. Help. [crying] [screams] [car engine turns over] [suspenseful music] [♪♪] [eerie guitar music] [♪♪] [dramatic music] [♪♪] [radio static] [muffled chatter] You still awake? [groans] In the middle of a high speed chase. This better be important. I just feel so good knowing you're out there keeping us safe. [laughs] And yours on your end? There's a mess of chatter from state police, but it sounds like they got it under control. Anyway, you're about up so we'll see you when you get in. [yawns] Okay. Hold on. Looks like I got some kind of a... drunk teenager. I don't know. Hey! Hey, buddy, you know it's a little cold to be crawling all the way home. Stand by. [exhales] Big night, huh? [laughs] Holy shit. Dispatch, where am I taking this guy? Closest emergency services is still Marsh County. Not sure what's left of it after the fire. I think they're moving, but they're still listed on duty. Okay, uh, how about Lakeland? It's another twenty minutes at least. It's your call. Okay, you call ahead to Marsh. Let them know it's me that's bringing him in. You call ahead. [sirens blaring] [eerie music] [♪♪] Can I get some help here? Uh, Bev, I need hands up front. Bring a stretcher. Dispatch not call ahead? What? We didn't get a call. Bev! Uh, wanna get his feet? Yup, I'll get him. - Okay. One, two, three. - One, two, three. [grunts] Alright. [moans] Are you okay? Can you hear me? What's his story, Danny? Uh, he's bleeding, Bev. We're gonna take care of you. Beverly, we gotta get him on a monitor and into Dr. Powell. Let's go. [clatter] Oh. Hi. [groans] Coming back on the air after an interruption due to technical problems. What's that about? Who knows. They won't let me do anything around here. Oh, here's a good one. De-gloving. There's a picture. Ugh, Jesus. You know, statistically, you're more likely to die in a hospital than anywhere else. Cool. Well, I could give you a catheter. That could be fun. Are you even a nurse? [sighs] I am in training. That's so cool. How about I'm just gonna go to sleep, okay? I should go anyway. I guess you won't be needing this. Goodnight. All messed up. Well, uh, in time, would you say you ought to be able to wrap this up... [static] Well, you sure know how to make an entrance, Danny boy. Yup. How you feeling, Maggie? I've been having some pains. Dr. Powell says the baby might be on it's way. Yup, she's kicking up a storm in there that's for sure. [laughs] Anyhow. I'm just glad the doc stuck around. That fire really did a number on this place. And I can't afford to be driving her into the city every time that kid gets fidgety. Give it a rest, grandad. [laughs] [indistinct chatter] Let go of me! - Stop! - Calm down. Calm down. - One more second. - Let go of me! - Stop! - Just one more second. Easy. Breathe. Okay. I'm not gonna miss this. You gonna be able to handle him, Richard? Your friend here's had quite a trauma. Well, not that we have any ID bracelets left, but for the record his name is James. How bad is he? Well, he's not been very cooperative. The sedative will help us determine exactly what his condition is, but our resources are limited here. Everything's been packed up for the move. Looks like James here isn't any stranger to needles. Where'd you find this guy? He fucking bled on me. Kim, I know getting transferred over here wasn't your first choice, but you're supposed to be boxing up files. No, there are things called computers now. [scoffs] Can computers put files in boxes? Thank you! [sighs] So old school. [groans] You might need something a little stronger if you're gonna get that stain out. [mumbles] Whatever, fuck. I can do my own laundry. Well! Look at you. Brought you uh, coffee. Nice. I was looking for that. It's mine now so don't you get any ideas. Right. [laughs] You're being friendly. It's good to see you. Uh... I'm sorry. Am I interrupting something? - No, no. - No. No, no, no. I'm just gonna go make sure Bev hasn't murdered my intern. I'll see you. [sighs] Our guest is out for now. He's not badly hurt, but it will be a while before you can talk to him. Fuck. You should be gentle with Alison. She's still coming to terms with what happened. Yeah, okay. As you know Daniel, there's nothing worse than losing a child. When we lost Sarah, I was a mess. It took a long time to come back from that. You just have to keep going. Yeah. [footsteps] [crying] Beverly. Are you okay? Beverly. What? Jesus Christ. [dramatic music] [♪♪] What the fuck are you doing, Bev? Beverly? This isn't my face. What, Bev? No, no, don't do that. Bev! Put the scissors down. Look at me! Bev, okay, stop! It's not me. No, no, no, don't do that. Bev. Can you help me? Bev, Bev, stop! No, no, no! Beverly, stop! [gunshot] Oh, fuck. [eerie music] [♪♪] Daniel! Daniel, what? - What did you do? - What the fuck? Kim. Kim, get out of here. [indistinct chatter] Kim, you don't need to see this. She killed him. I, uh... She came at me. She came at me. Okay. Alright. Was that a gunshot? Uh... My god, what happened? Beverly, she attacked Daniel and the Robinson kid. Okay, I gotta call this in. I gotta call... Give yourself a second, okay? - Just calm, calm down. - Tell them. I gotta... - Just give me a second. - Can you just call - from the office? - Give me a second. [puking] [water running] [eerie music] [♪♪] [eerie music] [♪♪] [echoing groans] [groans] How are you feeling? What? I'm fine. Shh. I'm okay. Take it easy, Daniel. It looks like you might have had a seizure. No, no, no, no. If you're feeling dizzy, Daniel, you shouldn't try to get up. Okay. Just sit down, okay? Come on. I gotta call it in. No, you need to take it easy. There's a state trooper already here. What? Oh god, how long was I out for? Not long. Apparently, he was already on his way. Something to do with that kid you brought in. Look, it's not important right now. This trooper's probably gonna wanna talk to you. We should see about moving you to a room. No, no, no. You just experienced an extremely traumatic event. Okay. Okay, look. You are stubborn like your father was now. You should take this very seriously. I-I am, I am. I'm good. Alright. Daniel. Mitchell. There you are. So what happened? They told me you found the two of them together. Uh, yeah. He was dead when I arrived and she came at me with a pair of scissors. How did you get here so fast? Your guy in the other room. What about him? We got a major bloodbath about twenty miles north of here. Looks like he tore the place up like a butcher shop. Uh, yeah. We looked him over and most of the blood on his body was not his. Well he has a long list of drug related priors. So I think he gave your nurse something. I've got him cuffed to the bed for the time being. He's been out cold. Well I'm here now. I'll sort it out. I need to take your firearm. Yeah. You know, Carter, your dad was a stand up cop. I wonder what he'd think if he saw this shit show. Okay, we need to make sure everybody's accounted for. Who else is here? Dr. Powell and Kim. Oh, and um, Ben and Maggie. She's pregnant. Christ, what a mess. Hey, uh, do you mind if I call it in? Alright. Thanks. [radio static] I'm not getting through in here. Are you copying, Mitchell? I'm gonna try the car. Copy. [keys jingling] Dispatch, this is Carter at Marsh County. Do you copy? [radio static] Dispatch, this is Carter at Marsh County. Do you copy? I have a code three and I need assist. [radio static] Fuck! [suspenseful music] [♪♪] Hi! What the fuck are you doing? [eerie music] [♪♪] Shit, shit! [groaning] [dramatic music] [♪♪] Help me! Daniel, Daniel, Daniel! Richard! He's losing a lot of blood. Keep pressure over the wound. Daniel, it's fine. Look at me. Kim, I need you to bring me a Sutra kit and 8mg of morphine. Keep your eyes on me, you hear me? Did you hear what I said? Kim? Kim, what are you doing? Kim, did you hear me? For fuck's sake, come here. You'll be alright, Daniel, you'll be alright. Keep breathing. Put both your hands here. Firm pressure. - Okay. - Don't stop. You keep him awake. Keep your eyes on him. - Keep his eyes on you. - Good boy, Daniel. - Good boy. - Kim! Don't let him close his eyes. - Hey! Stay awake. - Stay awake, Daniel, stay awake. Hey! [eerie music] [♪♪] [heart beating] Daniel. Daniel? I've stopped the bleeding for now. Oh, thank god. [mumbling] We know. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hey. Okay, maybe don't try to get up just yet. What happened out there? Just give him a second. It looks like they've got the place surrounded. They're not trying to get in. Who are they? I don't know. I wasn't able to get through. You? No. We should move everyone back inside. Who knows what they want. No, maybe we can barricade the doors or uh, you know, get out some other way. [screaming] Shit. I forgot about him. [screaming] Do something! [yelling] Fucking shoot it! Oh my god, please! Do something! [deep groans] Help me! [gunfire] Help me! Oh my god, fucking help me, god damnit! Help me, help me! [dramatic music] [♪♪] [deep groans] [suspenseful music] [♪♪] [shrieking] What is that? I think that was Beverly. [shrieking] Jesus, what the hell was that? We're leaving. Now, now, now, now. [glass breaks] Hey, that's not a good idea, Daniel. Wait, wait, wait. What about those fucking lunatics out there? We got other things to worry about, believe me. Mitchell, Mitchell! You and I, let's go get the cars, okay? Are you with me? [banging at door] [screams] What the hell was that? Make safe, back up. Stay away from the doors! - He's got a gun. - Back, back, back. Okay, make safe. Make safe. [screaming] Okay, okay, drop it! [screaming] Whoa! Okay, drop it! Drop it! Fuck you. Get the fuck back. Okay, put it down. Stay calm, stay calm. Whoa, everybody, just stay calm! Stay the fuck away from me. [heavy breathing] Calm down! [clattering] Okay! Put down the gun, it's okay. Everybody just calm down. - Calm down, you said? - Richard, Richard, Richard. No, no, no. [indistinct mumbling] There's no reason to involve her in this. Richard. It's not gonna help you. Listen. Just give me the knife and this will all be over. It isn't gonna help you. Richard, I don't know what to fucking do! Don't worry, Maggie. He's not going to hurt you. Just let me have it. [chaotic yelling] [screams] - No! - Richard! Kim, Kim! I got him, I got him. [suspenseful music] [♪♪] Kim. [nervous crying] Look at me, look at me. We are not gonna die in this fucking place! Nobody wants to be in here any longer than we have to. Believe me. No, he's not going anywhere. [suspenseful music] [♪♪] [indistinct yelling] Fucking idiot! [chaotic yelling] [suspenseful music] [♪♪] [gunshot] [slithering] Alright. What the fuck was that? Sweetheart, you're gonna be fine. You're gonna be fine. Fuck's sake, he stinks. [gurgled yelling] Mitchell! [groaning] [muffled screams] [screams] Stay back! [dramatic music] [♪♪] [bullet shell drops] [gunshot] [yelling] [yelling] [suspenseful music] [♪♪] [panting] Oh, fuck. [door opens] Get in the office. Get in the office now. Now, now! Get in the office. Okay, go to the office! What the fuck was that? I'm not gonna argue with you. Go, go! You need to tell me what's in there. I don't know what's in there. - But please, just go. - Lock the door. Okay. You hold on. Who are you? Get the fuck away from me. Whoa, whoa, just slow down. Who are you? Who are you? Just tell us that. I want him. Okay, look. - Alright? - Alright. I think we all agreed that we need to get the hell out of this building, right? These personal differences, they're... [thud] Oh, Daniel! Stop. No one is going anywhere. Okay, alright. Okay. We don't know anything about this place. If you let us here, we can trust them. You don't need to do this. Stop! He can't answer you. Shaun! See? That's what the last people he trusted did. No, you're making a mistake. You can trust us, you can trust us. I don't think so. [chaotic yelling] Wait, wait! Please, please! Whoa, whoa, whoa. Get your hands off me. [panting] Are you okay? You calm down. Okay, we're good. You wanna go through all this again? I know you believe me when I tell you we don't know what the fuck is going on, okay? I... There were things growing out of her. You saw it, you saw it. What was that? We could uh, burn what's left of the place. Take them all with it. Okay, listen to me. We didn't do anything to you. I have a girl back there who's about to give birth and I need to get her some place safe. Are you fucking kidding? Have you had a look outside lady? There's nowhere to go. You can hear those horns for miles. There is something calling them all here. Okay, what is that? Who are they? What just... How the fuck should I know? - Go ask them! - It's okay, it's okay. All I know is that that thing woke up once already and I don't wanna be around when it happens again. [door opens] Oh, there's a problem. Maggie. I didn't know what to do. Okay. Hey, sweetie. Are we leaving? No, not just yet. Would you put that out? Al. - What, this? - Yeah. Put it out. Okay. I think we all should just remain calm. Bullshit. We should've been out of here already. You people need to wake up. Or what? You think you'll stand a chance if there's another one of those things out there? - Okay. - Will you, huh? - Okay, okay. - Who's gonna stop it? Grandpa? The teenage fucking slut. Oh! Come on now! Whoa, whoa! Come on. We're gonna die. [crying] No, we're not gonna die. You're gonna die. I'm not gonna let that happen. Okay. Okay. I don't know what the fuck you think you're trying to do. Okay? Just calm down. He's upsetting her and that is not good. - I need you to stay calm. - Okay. Can you please tell me what is going on over there? Her contractions are still spread out, but she's having abdominal pain which is a bad sign. Okay, I don't know what that means. What does that mean? That means that we can't move her. It can make things much worse. Also the last thing I need is to be performing a cesarean in the middle of this, but I have nothing here to help her and if I don't do anything the baby could die. I need to go to the med supply room. So I'll go. Alone? No, no, no, that's out of the question. I'm not asking. We need to handle this now. Alright. Okay, look. We have no idea what is out there. We have no way of defending ourselves. Plus these two fucking psychos now think that we're hostage. I'm doing this. You're not. You're not. You're not even... If this is because of the baby then you need to get a fucking mental check. Jesus Christ, this is not about us. That girl, if she suffers an abruption then her baby will die. If I try to take it out of her, and I don't use anesthetic then she could die of shock. Daniel, look at me. Okay, fine. Fuck it, fuck it. Uh... Okay, but you're not going alone. You have to promise and wait for me, okay? You promise? - Okay. - Alright. May I approach? The girl's not doing well and neither is the baby so we need to go and get some things to help her. What do you want from us? Well I have a shotgun in my cruiser. I have ammunition. [laughs] We just fought our way in here. I'm not gonna just stroll back out again. Okay, but as far as I can tell we're all the same boat. You've got a rifle without any bullets and a couple of fucking fire axes. I just... it's close and we can do it fast. [sighs] Alright, but we're not risking our lives for you. We get that gun, it's ours. Oh, absolutely. Abso-fucking-lutley. Okay. I thought you said it was close. What the hell? It's still out there. Yeah, but what are they waiting for? Let's just make this quick. Shotgun's locked on the front seat. I gotta release it, but... you get all the ammo out of the trunk. Don't get any bright ideas. Hey, hold up. God damnit. What if they don't come back? Daniel knows what he's doing. It's alright. I shouldn't even be here right now. I should be at Lakeland turning over patients. Fuck this place. Well, you're stuck with us now, Kim, so deal with it. [soft sobs] How you doing, honey? It hurts. What's gonna happen to my baby? Listen to me. You and your baby are going to be fine. You have my word. [suspenseful music] [♪♪] Shit. Fuck. What the fuck are you doing in there? [suspenseful music] [♪♪] [screeching sound] What the fuck's going on in there? Ah, shit. K, time's up. That's our cue to leave. [eerie music] [♪♪] Come on, god damnit! Fuck's sake! Fucking hurry up! Look out! [gunshot] I'm keeping the fucking gun. This place isn't gonna keep anything out. Oh my god. Hey. Fuck. What happened? Here, here. Where's Allie? Well she went to get some medicine for Maggie. Where? The med room. Jesus Christ. She said there wasn't anything to worry about inside. Are you guys in the same fucking building? Would you please wait here, look after them? Excuse me, sir, would you mind following me? Thank you. That kid will be fine. He's been through a lot worse. Those people killed his family. I barely got him out of there alive. Yeah, what about you, man of mystery? Mind your own business. And by the way, pretty stupid to go running off by herself. Okay, I'm pretty certain you can beat the shit out of me, but I consider it my special privilege to hate my wife right now so if you could kindly shut the fuck up. This is Mitchell's gun. Look. What? [phone ringing] [phone ringing] Hello, Daniel. Who is this? You saw... something. I felt it when you woke up. But what was it? I can show you more if you'd like. Hi, Richard. I'm sure it's hard for you to understand. Beverly found it difficult as well, but I assure you my intentions are altruistic. Please tell me what you've done. Richard. Richard, tell me. Tell me! You're trying so hard to follow in your father's footsteps, Daniel. Do you really wanna follow him where he's gone? I understand how desperate loss can make you. The night you brought Allison to me, the life inside her desperately clawing to get out. Losing my daughter changed me, but I'm doing what I have to to make it right. You'll understand soon enough. Just please, can you please tell me where Allison is? Just... You tell me, god damnit. You tell me where she is. Don't worry, Daniel. I'm gonna help her. I'm gonna help all of you. [suspenseful music] [♪♪] This is crazy! I don't know what I'm doing. You can't just leave us. Kim, Kim, Kim. We don't have a choice. Allison's the only one who knows how to look after Maggie. Please, look. Just... these still seem to work inside. No. We'll keep in touch just in case. We're not gonna be gone long, we're not going far. - Look. - It hurts. It hurts so bad. I don't know what half this stuff is! Please, please don't... Listen to me. Listen to me, please. We're just gonna down there, I'm gonna bring back Allison, and I need you to hold out until then, alright? What if something happens? What if those people get in here? What are we supposed to do? Those people are not trying to get in here. Those people are trying to keep us from getting out. Okay, that's the best that I can do. I hope you know how to use it. And uh... that's there just in case. You better know what you're doing. [suspenseful music] Okay, let's go. You think were just gonna go down there and that'll be that? If you have something to say than say it, you smug fuck. Do you know what's down there? Nope. But I know someone who might. Hey. Hey, meth boy. Oh shit. Oh, good, you remember us. It's not my fault, okay? You gotta believe me. I didn't fucking do anything. - Just save it. Save it! - Please help me! - These guys are gonna kill me! - Hey! You're gonna wanna pay attention to my questions. Please. No, wait, wait, wait! Oh god, please don't! - Alright, pick a finger. - Don't do this. No, no, you didn't ask me anything yet! I wanna make sure you know I'm serious. I believe you, okay? - I fucking believe you. - Okay, okay, hey! Do you know anything that will help keep us safe? Anything at all. Anything that will help us survive. It's the fucking doctor. It's that fucking doctor. Okay, fine, we know that already. We don't have time for this. Alright, you know what? Make it clean. No, no, please. It is him. It's him and I killed him. I swear to god I did you a fucking favor. Yeah, well he's not dead anymore. How is that possible? What? Oh god. Oh, no, no! [distant screaming] Look at me, look at me! Oh god! Stop! Listen to me. How is he alive? What is he? I don't fucking know. Okay, take his hand off. No, no, please, please! I don't know, I'm serious. I met a girl on the road. Fucking please, please, please. I met a girl on the road and she told me she could help me score crystal so I followed her to this fucking pill house. Except it wasn't a pill house. What was it? What was it? It was an old farm house in the middle of nowhere. All of these fucking junkies. It was a mess. It looked like they'd been killing people for a while. He gave us drugs. He watched us have sex. And he called the place a church. Okay, what you're telling me that Richard was some kind of sex fiend, religious thing? My dad knew him for years, we all did. That's bullshit. They were dressed just like this. There's a bunch of people dressed like this, okay? And they did killings and sacrifices and they made us watch. You're talking devil worshiping? No. No, I don't believe in the devil. Okay, but I believe in this. They made people change. I saw it. Thank you. You're coming with us. There's no reason to thank us. What? Yeah. You know what? We're gonna visit your friend in the basement. No! - Mhm. - Are you nuts? No, you've seen he can do. Let's just get out of here, okay? Fuck this place. Yeah? Have a look. Go on. Be my guest. No, this is suicide. Oh my god. No, you're as crazy as they are. Yeah, maybe. [door opens] Down here. Looks like this place is gonna collapse. Can you hear me okay? Loud and clear. The stairwell to the basement is at the back of the building. Roger that. Got it. [eerie music] [♪♪] Look. Someone's been here. [eerie music] [♪♪] Kim! Where are we going? The door to the morgue should be right there in front of you. [radio static] I don't see any door. Just a bunch of corridors. You sure this is the right place? He went down the wrong stairs. There's only one set of stairs. I know where they're going. Hello? Carter! Better not be leading us into a trap. [radio static] [muffled chatter] What's going on? Oh, you gotta be kidding me. Did you find it? Is there some kind of sub-basement or... No, no, no, what are you talking about? - A staircase going down. - What? [radio static] Carter, can you hear me? [eerie winds] We gotta go back. I can't ask you to follow me down here. You understand? Guys, what's happening? Nothing. We're... We're gonna go down the stairs. Hey, leading in with him. Hey, you get to go first. Yeah, right. I'm not asking. Be quiet. [mumbles] [eerie music] [♪♪] Don't bother. You won't be able to move. What? Richard? Be patient. I'm almost ready. What-what-what is this? I saw you die. I had no idea that it would feel like this. The years I spent operating on people. Opening them up and stitching them back together again. It's remarkable, the sensation it's... not pain, more a sense of release. Why, why are you... Be quiet, please. This is uncharted territory. The chance to study my own transformation. I understand your hesitation, Allison, but let me ask you, all these years, haven't you ever wished to save someone beyond saving? No matter what the costs? Well, losing Sarah destroyed me. But it also compelled me to find a solution. You'd be surprised at the things you find when you go looking. [footsteps] [eerie music] [♪♪] It smells like a grave. [emergency flare sparks] I've seen this place before. This was all over the house we cleaned out. He made us look at things. The worst things I've ever seen. We found rooms full of bodies in the basement of that place. They had someone on a table like they were doing surgery down there. Half turned into one of those things. No! No, worse than that. Like a nightmare. [panting] It isn't real. It's not real. [dramatic music] [♪♪] It's a rat's maze. Carter! [radio static] Is he here? Hey! Yeah. He has took me here to... baby. I'm right here, kiddo. It's okay, it's alright. You're gonna be fine. You're lucky your grandpa cares about you so much. My grandpa just yells at his TV and smokes. [screams] Shit! - Help her, help her. - Shit, okay, okay! Wait, wait. Help her, please. - The paradigm, I think. - Alright. Okay, Maggie, hold still for one second. I got this. Okay. I'm gonna give you something that's really gonna help you. It's gonna feel really good. - You're doing real good. - It's alright, it's alright. - Okay. - It's gonna be real painless. It's gonna be okay in a second. - Okay, okay. - Just give me a second. Okay, okay. Okay, you gotta hold her still. You gotta hold her still. [crying] Easy, once I get this in. Okay, ready? There you go. Yeah, yeah. It's okay. There's no problem. No problem. [eerie music] [♪♪] Great. I'm not going in there. Fucking shoot me. Hey. This is it. This is what? I appreciate your enthusiasm but we need to think this through. [door creaking] This is a mistake. Come here, you little fuck. Do you know where you go when you die? I do. You travel on, reborn into something else, like a caterpillar becoming a moth. Until now I've only been able to track the moth in its cocoon. The body has to adjust, of course. It adapts. We weren't built for this kind of thing. I admit, early on I made mistakes. Some of those earliest mistakes are still down here with us. [echoing shouts] In fact, they caused the fire that destroyed this hospital. You see, they want to die, but I won't let them. [sobs] Don't cry, Allison. I am going to help you. This is an end to the cycle of life and death. Do you really want this world? This world that took your son from you? Do you know what happened that night to your unborn child? No, please. Umbilical cord became entangled. Simple as that. Strange, isn't it? The very lifeline between you and your child, constricting like a noose around his neck as he struggled to get out. Tighter and tighter until finally it couldn't struggle anymore. Nature's futility. I can stop it. This is the first real step. The true resurrection. I lost my daughter to the abyss, but tonight, I am calling her back. Richard. Please. Don't do this. But it's already done. [suspenseful music] [panting] You are so beautiful, Allison. You will become something truly remarkable. [suspenseful music] [♪♪] This is a slaughter house. [gagging] Get this off of me! Shut the fuck up! I should've killed you back at the house. Get a hold of yourself. [baby crying] [growling] Is she alright? She feels hot. Oh god. [screams] - Lord! Do something! - Oh god, okay! Okay! [mumbling] Uh... Get a hold of yourself. Fuck you. Look around us, huh? I told you. This was a mistake. He knows something. [grunts] [baby crying] We need you with us. [high-pitched ringing] He's in his head! He's in his head! [mumbling] [punching] Stop it! [grunts] [whispering] [suspenseful music] [♪♪] [growling] We're in hell. [dramatic music] [♪♪] [gunshot] [gunshot] [gunshot] [screams] You've got to hold her still! It's gonna be okay! It's gonna be okay! [sobbing] [glass breaks] That's the front entrance! [screams] [dramatic music] [♪♪] [gunshot] [gunshot] [gunshot] Where are you going? Wake up, damnit! [crying] I can't do it! - I can't do it! - You have to! [dramatic music] [♪♪] [inaudible yelling] [dramatic music] [♪♪] [screaming] No! No! No! No! No! [dramatic music] [♪♪] [growling] You do what you have to do! I'll keep those bastards out. I can't kill her. You have to do this. You are the only chance she has. No. Please! Sorry, I can't. Please do this! [suspenseful music] [screams] Oh my god! Why did you do that? It's finally time. How could you? Your baby. Doctor Paul is a great man. I'm lucky to carry his child. Nothing else matters now. [screams] [dramatic music] [screaming] Don't worry. Everything is about to change. Get the fuck away from me! [crying] [panting] [screams] [suspenseful music] [♪♪] [creaking] [creaking] [whispering] Just wait. Just wait. What do we have to do? Just wait. This is your fault. This is your fault! [grunts] [grunts] I wasn't there. You should've protected them! Mother wants us to stay. I told you, look after them. But you stayed here. You should have protected them! Stay here, stay here. [screams] [groans] [panting] I'm sorry. What is this? [panting] Carter, Carter, Carter! [speaker echoing] Carter, where are you? Shut the fuck up, shut the fuck up, shut the fuck up. Shut up. Fuck! [suspenseful music] [♪♪] Daniel? Daniel? Allison. Where are you? I'm scared. No, no, no, no. Allison, I'm right here. I'm right here. I'm right here. Look at me, it's okay. Oh, I can feel it coming. Oh, wow. Hold my hand. I need you. I'm not gonna leave. Daniel. I know your secret. I saw it in your face. The night Allison lost your child. I saw relief. What have you done? I've given her what she wanted. She's a mother. Isn't she beautiful? [suspenseful music] [♪♪] Daniel. Stay. [suspenseful music] [♪♪] Do you see, Daniel? Tell me what you see. I see... a monster that thinks he's god. I'm disappointed. Of all the things I've shown you and you still don't understand. No. No, you're right, I don't. I refuse to let death be the end. I defy god. There are things much older. Older than time and they blessed me. Well, congratulations. I spent my life resisting death, but now I understand. I must embrace it. I'll have my beautiful daughter back. I just need one final thing. [suspenseful music] [♪♪] Come, join me. [suspenseful music] [♪♪] The others have all gathered to witness my daughter's rebirth. My disciples ready for their own transformation. You'll experience it yourself, but first, you have to die for me... like your father and son before you. You've done wonderfully, my dear. Now watch. You will be my audience. Watch the abyss open itself to me. [chanting] [chanting] [cracking] [chanting] [dramatic music] [♪♪] Calvin, bless my baby. Place my daughter into this vessel. [screeching] [screams] Yes. Give yourself to her. [panting] Let her come to be. [screams] [baby crying] It's her. You see? [growling] [dramatic music] [♪♪] Hey! [gunshot] [dramatic music] [♪♪] [gunshot] [dramatic music] [♪♪] [screams] Look out! [dramatic music] [♪♪] [gunshot] [groans] Do it! Do it! Do it! Do it. [screams] [screaming] We will all be saved. Everything has led to this. [inaudible muttering] [crash] [muffled groans] I can see it all before me. The infinite astro workings. It's beautiful. [dramatic music] [♪♪] Don't fight it, Daniel. I can give Allison to you. That's what you want, isn't it? She's waiting for you. All you have to do is let go and you can be together. That's a good boy. This isn't the end. [suspenseful music] [♪♪] Yes. Yes. Yes. [suspenseful music] [♪♪] [creaking] [groaning] [dramatic music] [♪♪] [growling] [suspenseful music] [♪♪] [panting] [suspenseful music] [♪♪] [hysterical breathing] [screams] [crying] Is it over? Is it over? [crying] [dramatic music] [♪♪] [dramatic music] [♪♪] [thunder cracking] [radio static] [folk music] [♪♪]
