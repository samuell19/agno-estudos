Well? Mika, we've been looking for you. - Listen, we've got great news. - You're a father. - You have a child. - A son! - Congratulations! You have a son. - Quiet down, will you? We're trying to hunt here. Let's go, boys. Mika, don't you care? You got a new son. - You're a father. - You're making too much noise. You'll warn the seals, and we'll come back empty-handed. You're welcome. It's always a pleasure to bring good news. Maybe you didn't hear what we've been saying. You're a brand-new daddy. You have a son. You're officially a father. I'm a father, you say? I'm a father! All right, I'm a father! I have a new baby boy! Guys, have I got news for you! I have a... - You have a son. - I knew that. I just couldn't think of the word. A son! Terrific timing. I'm happy for you. - I guess our work here is done. - Congratulations. That's great news, Mika. I'm sure your little boy will be a joy to us all. Stop, now. Whoa! Please, that's enough. - Mama, can I go play? - Of course, Lars, but don't go too far. - Promise you'll stay nearby. - Polar bear's word of honor. Just wait. I'll get you back for this. They sure do grow up fast, don't they? - That was a great dive, Lars. - Do you mean it? Thanks. I wasn't trying to dive, though, Greta. I was trying to catch a fish. Is that right? Looks more like the fish caught you. - I suppose you could say that. - I'm over here. - You wanna do something together? - Sure, like what? - Well, we could visit the igloo. - Oh, please. Not again. - You have a better idea? - Let's go for a swim. How can you be so big and still not be able to swim? I could swim when I was a baby. You're not afraid of the water, are you? It's cold, but it feels good. Maybe I'll meet you at the igloo later, okay? See you. Life's so awful, the world's no good We'd leave it behind if we could Tomorrow's just a cause for dread The only way out is to stay in bed There's never any joy Never any cheer It gets worse and worse From year to year Brother, you can say that again. The world has brought me Down so low I've decided to jump In the deep, white snow - What are you doing? - Leave him alone. - He doesn't want to see anymore. - But he doesn't have to bury his head. If he doesn't want to see, he can close his eyes. - Do you need some help? - No, thanks, smarty-beak. Let's go find a cave where nothing happens and no one can find us. No one loves us, no one wants us They're all so nasty... - They're weird. - I don't get it. Why are the lemmings so unhappy? It's a mystery. If we knew, we could help them. Hey, wait! I'll show you a neat place where you can... ...bury your head in the snow for hours and no one will find you. Hey, Anna! Stop! What? I'm just cleaning off the board. Cut it out. Watch this. Whoa! You have to try this, Lars! - I don't know... - There's nothing to be afraid of. - What? I'm not afraid! - See you later! Hey, wait. I can get you. You'll see. Oh, yeah? What's taking so long? Well, it's your own fault. You shouldn't mess around. Hey, wait. I just want to say thank you. Here. This is for you. For me? Gee, thanks. - Smells good. - I'm Robby. - Hi, I'm... - Lars! - Greta? - Lars, what in the world are you up to? You know we're not supposed to be talking to seals. - Yeah, but, you know... - Yeah, but what? You won't tell anyone, will you? Especially not my father. You can have the fish. Here, take it. - It's fresh. - I don't want it, Lars. Come on, let's go home. Stop worrying about it. I'm not going to say anything to anyone. It's cool. - Thank you, Greta. - Don't mention it. Robby? Wanna play? Now, how often have I told you guys? You can't sing. Here. - Tag! - You're it! Got you! Got you! - Got you back! - I'll get you! Well! You're Robby, aren't you? And you! You must be Lars. My word, I don't believe my eyes. A seal and a polar bear playing together? Amazing. It's an extraordinary day. - Yes, a very nice day. - I agree. I must say, I'm flabbergasted. Completely. What a sight! Unbelievable. I never would have imagined it. Hold on! I've only got four flippers. Okay, okay. You scrounger. Here. Oh, yeah! - Grandma? Grandma? - Yes, Lena. - I'll give you three guesses what I saw. - Only three? - Yes. - Well, let me see. - A snow rose. - No. I thought for sure that was it. - I know. A white whale. - No. Well, now, if it wasn't that, I have no idea what it could be. Don't give up, Grandma. You have one more guess. In that case, it could be only one thing. It has to have been an ice prince and a sea cow. No. There was no ice prince. There was just a polar bear. - And a... - Yes? And a what? No. It would be a bad idea to tell you. - I don't think you'd believe me anyway. - You're right, dear. It's likely something you'll never see again, and you'd be silly... ...to make yourself look ridiculous by telling people strange stories. Oh, good heavens, Grandma! How on earth did you know? - Papa? Papa? - What is it? My friend and I are in the middle of a game. Can I stay outside and play a little bit longer? I suppose it's all right, son. But just five minutes. It's getting late. I promise. Polar bear's word of honor. And a seal's word of honor too. Thank you. - What's going on? - That's what I plan to find out. - Couple more feet and we got it. - Ready? Go! Am I seeing this right? I mean, it's a... It's a young seal. We're nearly there. Come on, Robby. This will be great. I guess, if you say so. Look, I already made it to the top. Come on. Just a little more to go. - So, what do you think? Great view! - Oh, you bet. - Amazing. How did you find this spot? - My father showed it to me. Look. What's happening down there? My parents are in trouble! We've got to do something! - Jump in the water! - Can anybody hear us? Mama, Papa, you've got to get out of there right now! The polar bears are coming! Lars, they can't hear us. Mama! Papa! It's no good. What can we do? My snowball alarm. It's guaranteed to wake them up. Lars? - Well, did we pull it off? - Guess so. - Mika's son did this. - Let's get him! - Oh, no. - Jump! Hurry, Lars. - Jump! - Robby, I can't swim. Don't worry. Jump! Come on, you've gotta do it now. You can't get away from us. Come on! We have to swim through here. Where are we? Are they still after us? What a surprise, kid. Brutus? - Brutus? - What is it? I have a feeling something's very weird around here. Quiet. - A witness! - I don't know a thing. - Tell me where they are. - Who? Lars, of course, and his seal friend. Don't play innocent with me. I'll give you five seconds. One... Watch out! I don't like this place. - This was a bad idea, if you ask me. - Yeah? Well, who's asking you? They're gone, Lars. Lars? Where are you? Lars? Lars! Pretty funny, huh? Look at what else I found here. This one's hilarious. Are you crazy? You scared me to death. - How about this one? - This place is spooky enough. Wow! Look at all this stuff in here. What do you think? You ready to sail away? That's what you get for scaring me. - I'll get you back. - Oh, no. Oh, yes. You just wait. I'm the great white hunter. Here I come. You're way too slow. You'll never even catch me. Had enough yet? Do you give up? - You'll get tired pretty soon. - Not before you do! Listen, Sophocles, I'm the most peaceful guy you'll ever meet... ...but Mika's son drives me crazy! He does what he wants... ...no matter the consequence. Consequently, he's causing a lot of trouble. - Everything's upside down! - And even worse, inside out. Things are definitely not right around here. - That boy nearly killed me. - You can't be serious. You say my boy almost took out the toughest polar bear in our pack? He tried to bury me in an avalanche. And all because he was worried about some seals. Right, and all we were going to do was chase the herd around a little. We were just having fun, that's all. Yeah, it was a game. That's what it was. And your son had to go and mess everything up. I still don't see where he did much harm. Clever old Mika, Mr. Know -it-all. Instead of making excuses for his behavior... ...punish him! He has a screw loose! You take that back! Stop that. Stop at once, I say. You're not going to solve the problem this way. Mika, you have a talk with Lars. And I'll make sure that Robby's father has a chat with his son. As for you three, you go on home and take a nap. Things won't seem so unbearable after you've had a good sleep. Fine, then. I hope you have a good time talking to your son, Papa. Well, now, so much for that. Come on, boys. I'm sure Daddy Mika will take care of everything. Well, now, sure. Let's face it. I mean, I have to tell him. There's no way around it. - Lars? - Yeah? There's something we have to talk about. - Where are you going? - I don't want to hear it. Please, Lars, this is difficult enough. Don't make it harder. - It's about Robby, right? - Yes and no. - I really do like your new little friend. - Great. I'm glad to hear it. - He's such a good guy. - Yes, but there are limits. Limits? What do you mean? Well, let's use the seals, for example. Can you imagine them being friends with the fish? No, that would never work out. There, you see? That's what I mean. Polar bears and seals can't be friends either. It never works out. But, Papa, Robby and I are friends. It will work out, no matter what you say. - We can't be friends anymore. - I know. Well, that's it, then. - You take good care of yourself. - You too, Lars. - I should go. - Bye. Lars? What are you doing? I'm setting sail. - Out to sea? - Yes. I'm off to a country where we can be friends. We're gonna sail to the end of the world, you and me. Wait, are you sure we're allowed to do that? - Nobody can stop us now. - Not even our fathers? - Nobody at all. - Okay! Then let's go where no one can find us. Aye, aye, captain! - All aboard! Anchors, aweigh! - Set the sails, matey! Here we go! It seems they still don't understand which way the wind is blowing. Sophocles, every game has its set of rules. That much is as clear as the ink from an octopus. But suddenly, these two come along and turn everything upside down! And we're the ones who end up suffering for it. - We're in a lot of pain. - Day after day, year after year... ...everything around here was working out just fine. Everything was in its place. Or did any of you have a complaint? You've been complaining since we've known you. From morning till night. Now the world has turned upside down. Everything has changed. And why? Because of them! It's their fault. What do you mean, it's their fault? These boys became friends. Nothing's wrong with that. You can't stop them from seeing each other. - I could. - Don't you lay a paw on my son. Wait a minute! You can't jump from there! It's way too dangerous! Nothing's any good There's worse to come The world around Just makes us glum And when I feel so down and low 1 dive into the deepest snow Someone's gonna get hurt. Hey! What are you, stranger? Some kind of weird bird? Allow me to introduce myself. My name is Caruso, and I am a bird, my friend. No problem. It happens every time I try to fly. Take it easy, my friends. Calm down. Now, tell me. What can I do for you? - Can you flap around like that again? - Sure. If Caruso can find a way to cheer up our little lemmings after all this time... ...then surely we can settle our differences to everyone's satisfaction. - Oh, yeah? And how? - Well... We know. Go on, Robby. - Catch me a fish. - Right. Give it here. One fish won't fill you up, but if all the seals catch one fish... - ...you'll have plenty to eat. - There! The boy has found the solution. Certainly. The seals bring you fish... - ...and in return... - We make sure the seals are protected. - Who from? - From us! Hurrah! Now we can all be friends forever! Okay. Those are the new rules we'll live by. Well done, Lars. I tell you, I'm just flabbergasted. Uh-oh. A little polar-bear girl's fallen in love. Hold tight, son! - It's time for breakfast, little fishermen. - Those are the rules. You catch them, we eat them. So off you go. And make it snappy! Yeah, hurry up. My stomach's rumbling. You know what? I like these new rules. We should've done this years ago. We'd be sitting pretty. Hey, watch yourself. - That's enough! - What are you doing? Stop. Hey, stop it! Here we go, son. Hang on! Lars? Have you seen Lars? - What? - Lars. Is he here? Mika, he was out playing with you, wasn't he? No. I mean, he was, but then he disappeared. Oh, no, he's gone. Tell the others. I've got to go find him. Lars! Lars? Lars, are you here? This is weird. I think he's hiding. - Can you see him? - No. - No? - Nothing. Not a trace. Greta, how about you? Anything? Anything at all? Oh, no. Where am I? Papa? Papa, what's happening? Papa! Hello, Papa? Where are you? Papa, can you hear me? Papa, what's happening? Papa? Nothing? Sophocles? - Well, if it isn't little Robby. - What happened to Lars? It looks like a piece of the ice broke off. And then what? Then Lars drifted off on an ice floe, I would imagine. The wind would have taken him somewhere to the south. Where to the south? Hey, I know you're upset, but you don't have to bury your heads in the snow. - Yes, we do. - It's just terrible. - The worst possible news. - A real catastrophe, Caruso. - Now, what's the problem? - Lars has disappeared. Don't get so agitated. He'll be back. You just wait and see. - You're sure? - Well, I hope so. The truth is, it's always better to hope than to despair. If you never give up, you can never be defeated. Really? Yeah. Hello? A little seal has climbed all the way up here to see us. He must want something, but be careful. - We don't want to appear too gullible. - Can you help me find Lars? Okay, but can you give us the general direction where to start looking? Yeah. To the south. Help! Can somebody help me? No! Wait, over here! Come back, stupid ice floe! No! Stay here! Help! Can anybody hear me? Hey! Hello? Help! Well... Hey, hello. Hello? Why are you hiding from me? Say, it's just old Henry. I won't hurt you. Don't be afraid. Come out here and climb on old Henry's back. Wow, is it this colorful under the water too? Isn't this something? Lars, this is my favorite spot. Why, I come out here every single evening... ...just to sit and watch the beautiful sunsets. So, my boy, what do you think of this place? Oh, what is it? I was just thinking about the snow and Mama and Papa and Robby. I wish they were here right now. You're homesick. Well, of course. You've come to a strange place. It's perfectly natural to be homesick. You don't think that I'm a big crybaby? Me? Not at all. Don't be silly. Come on. Tomorrow, we'll ask Marcus. I'm sure he'll have an answer to your problem. Marcus? Who's that? Henry? Good night. Who lives way up here? Hope he's home. Well, I guess we should give it a shot. Marcus! I have a little lost friend here. He wants to find his way back to his family. - Wow! That's Marcus? - Yep, that's him. By the way, how do you feel about flying? - About flying? - You'd better get ready. Your ride's coming to pick you up. Goodbye, Lars. Have a good trip. Bye, Henry. Nice to meet you. Come back again someday. - Thanks for taking me home. - No thanks is necessary. The fact is, I'm not taking you home. I prefer to stay in the south. But what an eagle won't do is no problem at all for an orca. I'm turning you over to my friend Samson. Goodbye. See you, Marcus. Finally heading home at last. Are you ready? Because here we go, little polar bear. Keep looking. Please, guys, come on. We have to find him! Sorry, kid. Can't fly anymore. Our get-up-and-go just got up and went. - We're pooped out. - Just one more try. Please? - What do you say, boys? - All right. Hey! Lars! What? - I don't believe it. There's Lars. - Yeah, you're right. Lars? We found him. Great detective work. Lars! Lars! - How was the south? - Very colorful. - Lars! - Robby, Robby! You're finally home! - I missed you an awful lot. - I wished you were there. - Then take me with you next time. - Polar bear's honor. Caruso, let's go! Come on! Hurry, Anna, faster! Run! It's Lars! He's home! Look, Mika, our boy's come back to us again. Hello, Mama. Hello, Papa. I'm here. - Lars! - Lars! Papal My son, where did you learn to swim like that? My friend Henry taught me how. Isn't it great? - Take care, Lars. - Bye, Samson. Say hello to Marcus and Henry for me when you get back. - Hey, Lars. - Lars? - Lars? - Hi. Greta, Pieps, Anna. We just want to tell you how happy we are that you're home again. - I'm glad too. - Lars? - I think you've been very brave. - Really? Thank you. - Looks like our hero's asleep. - Yes. We better go now. Good night, Lars. Good night, Greta. I wish you all could have been there. So many colors to see. And my friend Henry. Far, far away... ...at the end of the world. Is this some kind of joke? It doesn't look to me like they want to play by the new rules. Come on, they're just goofing around with us. So that was the appetizer. Now, where's the main course? That's all there is. They're all gone. I hope, for your sake, that you're kidding. Sorry, little scrounger, not a single fish today. Not one fish in this whole big ocean. It's amazing, isn't it? - Is it true? Are they all gone? - They've disappeared. We'll have to go into the village to see if the humans have any fish. Lars, you'll get in hot water if your parents find out. - Wait, Greta, you... - Don't worry about it. My lips are sealed. I won't tell on you. - Our lips are sealed too. - Yeah. Closed up like a big clam. Hey, Lars. Are they all empty? Every one of them so far. - Nothing in this one. - Here either. Now what? Don't be such a worrywart. No one heard. Hey, stop! Down, boys! Get back! Let me take a look. Looks like we have a guest. That's a good boy. You're the one who was playing with the little seal, right? Let me see if I can find something for you. There isn't much. This is all I can offer you, I'm afraid. We call these fish sticks. You want to try one? Here. I see. The fish must have gone and disappeared on you too... ...like they did for us. - Lena, are you coming? - Yes, Grandma. Don't be afraid. Wait here, and I'll take you home later. - Lena, we're starting. - I'm coming. The Black Mouth Is eating all our fish The Black Mouth Is eating all our fish The Black Mouth Is eating all our fish The Black Mouth Is eating all our fish You can find your way back home from here. You really are a sweet little guy. Here. Take care. So this is where you are. Hey. How were you able to find me? I looked for your bright red nose. - What do you mean? - It shines in the dark. That's just silly. Hey. Let's head for home. - Brutus? - What? - I'm hungry. - Oh, me too. What's this? What's up with you? I just thought of something that's very funny. If our friends the seals don't supply us with fish... ...then the old rules are in force, and we can hunt them again! Perhaps I've been too soft with the boy. Bye, Robby. Lars. - Lars? - Yes, Papa. It was very foolish of you to go into the human settlement. Listen, that is no place for us, and it never will be. How can I make you understand? Humans are dangerous. They've taken most of the fish from the ocean. No, their nets are empty. They haven't caught anything. - I don't believe that. - But you have to believe me. The one doing it is the Black Mouth. I've never heard such garbage in my life. It's not garbage, Papa. Word of honor. Lars? Well, that's just fine. It happens to be the truth. Come back! Come back here! Lars! This is just like the old days. Yeah. If we wanted, we could go shake them up. It'd be easy. A real piece of cake. All right. Let's do it. What do you say? They're supposed to be running away from us! Papal Help me! What's happening here? Lars! We need help! - Mika, where's Lars? - I don't know. I've been looking all over for him. Don't worry, Papa. Lars will find a way to get us out of here. Save me! Lars, help! The Black Mouth Is eating all our fish The Black Mouth Is eating all our fish I'll lure that monster over to the big rock. - Mika, look. There he is. - Lars! Lars! Can you hear me? Come back, Lars. Greta, Anna, hurry! There's a monster! It swallowed all the seals, and now it's after Lars! - You said, a monster? - A great big giant monster. Are you telling the truth? I'm not lying. I hope we're not too late. Grab one of these boards, you guys, and follow me. This way. Come on, I'll ride with you. We can do this. Let's move it. Hang in there, Lars! We're coming! Look out below! Caruso, Caruso, over here! Hurry! What's up, folks? A monster's chasing Lars! - Oh, no! Lars! - Lars! I have to save the kid. You stay here. Don't give up, Lars, I'm on my way! Hang on, there's been a slight delay...! Out of the way! We can't stop! Oh, boy! Flap your wings and fly. Lars, help us! Hey, I'm flying. Of course I'm flying. I'm a bird, and birds can fly... - Hey! Are you all right, Caruso? - I've been better. Please hurry, Lars. Warning. Warning. Obstacle ahead. Full speed ahead. Recommend evasive maneuver. Can't catch me. - Full speed ahead. - Warning. Obstacle. Locked on target. Increasing speed. Warning. Obstacle ahead. What's going on? Oh, my goodness. That was close. Thanks. That was really weird. Are you guys okay? We are now. Saved by Mika's son. Who would have ever guessed? I said from the start, that boy was special... ...and he was going to be a great joy to everyone. Lars did it. He's a hero! Nina, he's alive. Hey, where's Caruso? Look, there he is! Thanks, Caruso. Unbelievable. I'm flabbergasted. - Thank you, Lars. - Yeah. Thanks. Life's not so bad after all. - It can be fun. - Things are definitely looking up. - Much nicer than yesterday. - Like I was telling you. Lars, you're the greatest! You saved everyone! That boy takes after his father. Lars? Lars! Grandma. Grandma! Grandma! - Yes, my darling? - You won't believe it. I had the strangest dream. All through the dream, everywhere I went, I saw this little white bear. He... No, come to think of it, I'd better not tell you. Well, Lena, it happens that some dreams do come true. Come true? You mean, my dream is...? Yeah! Hurrah! He did it! My little friend did it! Lars? Hello, Lars. I came to thank you for everything. Lars, you're a wonderful little polar bear. Thank you. You be sure to take care of yourself, all right? Hey, Lars. Your nose is shining bright red again. How strange, but he's right. It's definitely bright red. Hey, my nose isn't red. You're making fun of me. Just wait till I catch you. I'll get you both. You'll see. There's no two ways about it, Lars. You're the best little polar bear there ever was!
