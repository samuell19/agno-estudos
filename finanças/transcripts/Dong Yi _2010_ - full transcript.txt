Dong Yi Episode 17 Start the music! Wait! There you are! I've prepared royal food just for you! Is it ready? Yes, Your Majesty. It is porcine epidermis. It's pig skin! Your Majesty! We deserve death! Why are you saying such things at a momentous celebration like this! Eat to your heart's content! Before the music begins, I'm going to give you your real present. I'm going to appoint you as Royal Consort! You are truly gracious, Your Majesty! Your Majesty...! You have endured much. Is Her Majesty in? She is in the garden with the Queen. Is something wrong? - How nice the sunshine feels! - Yes, it must be spring. Will this old woman see spring again? Mother, why are you saying such things? Don't mind me, my daughter. I'm just happy being here with you. Your Majesty, you must hurry inside. What is it? What did you say? Lady Jang is going to be made a Royal Consort? The Royal Secretariat has received orders... ... to appoint Lady Jang as a Royal Consort of the 4th Order! Royal Consort? - Did my son really give those orders? - Yes, Your Majesty! Once Lady Jang is officially made a Royal Consort, Both she and the South Faction will become more bold with their endeavors! - What should we do, Your Majesty? - This cannot happen! I will not allow that fox to become royalty! Please compose yourself, Mother. I specifically told him not to do this! Not only he brought her into the Palace, but he's making her a Royal Consort? Does he think I'll allow this to happen? Mother...! I'm so full! So this was to celebrate Lady Jang's appointment? You silly boy! Are you deaf? That's what His Majesty said! I was in a daze when I saw His Majesty and can't remember anything! I don't even know if the food went into my mouth or my nose! I think you're right. Oh, your nose... there's still food on it! Really? Where..? - I'm joking, sir! - Dong Yi! You're the fool for believing her! Now that Lady Jang has been appointed, this is truly a great event! Yes, I'm so happy that such a wonderful thing has happened to her. - No, to you! - What? To me? That's right! Lady Jang has a soft spot for you. That's why if good things happen to her, it'll be good for you too! It's not like that! How could Lady Jang have any special feelings for me? But you have a special relationship with both her and His Majesty! A special relationship? How is that possible? I'm just a palace maid serving His Majesty and Her Highness. - What? - Take good care of me too. Sir! Your mouth is...! You're joking again! Did you get some information? Yes, His Majesty has gone to Lady Jang's quarters. All right. You may leave. - Your Majesty... - It's all right, Lady Han. I'll be more pitiful if you try to comfort me. So don't say anything. Were you upset with me? You were back in the Palace for a while, but the appointment didn't come sooner. Yes, I was a little upset. What? No, Your Majesty. This appointment came at the perfect time. I will accept it with great joy. It won't be easy for you. The West Faction will oppose this to the end, and mother will not accept it easily. Yes, I'm aware of that. It will be troublesome for you as well. Never in history has a Court Lady Concubine* been made a Royal Consort without reason. {\a6}*a palace maid made a Court Lady due to the King's favor Don't worry about that. I didn't make this decision easily. If there is no precedent, then we will have to make one. So you will wait patiently without any worry. Do you hear me? Yes, Your Majesty. I will put my trust in you. Here, pour me some wine. This may be the last cup I will receive from Lady Jang! Your Majesty... Since you have given me this great gift, may I give you a small one in return? A gift? What is it? - Your Majesty...! - What is it? Before the music begins, I'm going to give you your real present. I'm going to appoint you as Royal Consort! Your Majesty...! Oh no, it's smeared! What do I do? A tonic will be served to you, but first you must put your mind at ease. You must make sure that you are not agitated or excited. You may leave. - Your Majesty, you should lie down... - Prepare to visit the King. - Your Majesty, the physician just said... - I said prepare to visit the King! Your Majesty, the Dowager Queen is here to you. - Escort her in! - Yes, Your Majesty. Welcome, Mother! Please take a seat. I was just about to go to you. I'll keep this short. Take back the appointment you sent to the Royal Secretariat. Mother...! I said this a hundred, no, a thousand times! She cannot be made a Royal Consort! And I always replied with the same answer. Lady Jang's appointment is not only because of my personal feelings for her. It's for the sake of government. Please give me your approval. Yes, your intention is to use the South Faction in ruling this nation. I can understand that. Then take one of their daughters as a Royal Consort. Are you really unaware of why I'm so opposed to this? - Mother... - The Queen has yet to produce an heir. But what will happen if Lady Jang becomes pregnant? What will happen if she gives birth to a prince? Then you will most likely accept him as your successor. Am I wrong? I will never allow that to happen! Take back your order. You must know that a legitimate reason must be given... ... to appoint a Court Lady Concubine as Royal Consort. You must adhere to the rules of the Inner Court. What has Lady Jang done to deserve this appointment? What will you do if she has done something to deserve this appointment? Will you stand down? What did you say? She has done something to deserve this? What do you mean by that? Lady Jang is pregnant. She has done exactly what you are afraid of. Would you say that is a legitimate reason for her to appointed as Royal Consort? My Lady, you are heartless! You should have told me first! I was going to tell you. So please don't be upset, Mother. Upset? How can I be upset? I'm just so happy! Mother... You must take special care of her. Make sure the baby is safe. Yes, Madam, we will heed your words. - Leave us. - Yes, My Lady. This is a blessing from Heaven! Mother, you must not shed tears over this. This is only the beginning! - My Lady...! - This title is only the beginning. If I was satisfied with merely being a Royal Consort, I wouldn't have returned to the Palace. Yes, I know that. I know how ambitious you are. That is why you must be prepared as well, Mother. All this time, we waited with bated breath. Now there will no longer be any hesitation in my steps. Of course! You see? What did I tell you? Now that Lady Jang is Royal Consort of the 4th Order, she will have wings! If you and I want to fly too, we have to hold onto that fellow's overcoat! We have to hold onto his ankle, let alone his overcoat! - Did you hear the news? - What news? The news that Lady Jang is being made into a Royal Consort! That's the reason why I've been going in and out of the outhouse all day! Why? Because my stomach churns at the thought of that lowborn Yoon strutting about! - You silly woman! - Mother, this is not the time to be jealous! Then what do you want me to do? What else? Go there everyday and curry favor with her! What? If you truly care about Ho-Yang and me, you should even offer to do dirty work for her! - Do you understand? - Dear....! I can't believe it! How could he want me to do her dirty work? I'd rather drown myself in a bowl of water than do something like that! She startled me! Where are you coming from, Yoon? I mean... I was just at the Palace to visit Her Highness. Is that so? Is Her Highness well? She isn't well at all. She's lost a lot of weight. Why is that? Because she's pregnant. She has conceived His Majesty's child. Conceived? His Majesty's child? I have much to do for Her Highness. Goodbye. Wait...! What is it? Do you have something else to say? Y...yes! Is there anything I can help with... Madam? You only have to ask. Many others have offered their help, including the War Minister's wife. I'll think about whether you'll be useful. Let's go. As you've all heard, Lady Jang has conceived His Majesty's child, And she has been appointed as a Royal Consort. His Majesty declared that he would support us, ... and now Lady Jang is pregnant! It is finally our time, Brother! Our time...? - It's too early to say that. - Too early? My point is that the Palace is still rife with those who must be removed. - Yoon. - Yes, Uncle. It is now time to move forward with the plans that we've been delaying. - Let us begin. - Yes, Uncle. - What... what do you mean? - It's not for you to know. Since we're on the subject... Jang Hee Jae needs to be given a higher position to save Lady Jang's face. But even the position of Police Lieutenant is too great for him. It may hurt Her Highness if we put that degenerate into a position that's too much for him. You must not know Jang Hee-Jae very well yet. He's not as foolish as you think he is. You! Have you been away from duty without reporting to the Bureau? I have been told that there are many days when you don't even report for duty. Well.... I've been busy. Officer Jang, congratulations. - Officer Jang's sister has been made... - What has that to do with his duties here? Yes... that's true. I'm warning you. If this happens again, I will have you punished. Answer me! Sir...! Yes, I will heed your words, Chief. Just let it go. I wonder what's wrong with him? What a fearless man he is... It's a pity he needs some to live a long life. You startled me! It... it's me, Dong Yi. - Your Majesty! - Yes, did I scare you? What brings you here, Your Majesty? We'll talk about that later. Put down the book before you hit me with it! Yes, Your Majesty! - Have a seat! - Yes, Your Majesty. I was reading this book but I came here because I wanted to give it to you. What do you think? Do you like it? Yes, Your Majesty... - Is that all? - What? I thought you would be excited. Don't you like the book? - No, Your Majesty! It's not that! - Then why is your reaction so lukewarm? I thought you would be so happy you'd jump up and down! I am happy! It's just that it's so unexpected. Besides, this is the palace maid's office. I'm just afraid someone would come in. So what if someone comes in? I'm just about to leave anyway. Your Majesty... - Did I scare you that much? - Yes, you did, Your Majesty. You seem to like surprising people. You did the same thing at Lady Jang's banquet. The... the banquet? It wasn't just Her Highness that was surprised. All of us were surprised too. That... that was Lady Jang's birthday. And I had promised to make her a Royal Consort, But it took longer than expected. And so... so... Yes, I think you're right. By the way, Your Majesty, I heard Her Highness is expecting. Congratulations, Your Majesty. Y...yes. Thank you. - So... - Do you have something to say to me? You gave me this book, but I was wondering if you had another reason. No, I was about to leave. You must be busy so... Wait... So how are things? What? This office seems small. Shall I have it enlarged? Your Majesty... All right.. all right... You seem to have lost weight. Is something wrong? Your Majesty... All right, I'll go, but this office does seem awfully small. - Tell me if you have any problems. - Yes, Your Majesty. - So... - Do you have something to say to me? You gave me this book, but I was wondering if you had another reason. Must I have a reason to see her? Wretched girl. I wanted to have a chat with her. How busy can she be? Can she be busier than the King? - Give me the Royal Decree of Appointment. - Yes, Your Majesty. On the 8th day of April, 1686, under the laws of the Royal Household, Lady Jang of the Indong Jang clan has been appointed as Royal Consort of the 4th Rank. Thus, she will accept the appointment. Congratulations, Consort Jang. I pray you will be a good example to the Inner Court. I shall heed your words, Your Majesty. Congratulations, Your Highness! Congratulations, Your Highness! Congratulations, Your Highness! One Year Later... They're here! The Lady Investigators are here! The Office of Investigations will now search your quarters. You will all stop what you are doing and leave your quarters. Search for any contraband. Begin the search. Yes, My Lady! I will be searching your chambers. - Please give it to me. - Give what to you? The thing you hid in your hair. Just this once! If I get caught again, they'll cut my pay! I'm sorry, but that's not possible. I'm really sorry. Look in here. Here it is! Nothing nice today... - Oh my.. my.. my..! - We've completed the search. Well.... write down their names and take the repeat offenders to the Office! Yes, My Lady. Why haven't I seen Dong Yi? Where is she? - I don't know. - I wonder where she is. What? What is it? Go! The butterfly accessory isn't here either. - Let's go, Dong Yi. - Yes, My Lady. Why is there so much? How will we write down all of this? I know. They keep buying them as fast as we confiscate them! We're all going to die from having to search the entire Palace this week! Stop talking and record down the contraband! We'll never finish at this rate. Did you happen to see a butterfly accessory anywhere in the other rooms? A butterfly accessory? No. I see. You asked me this last time too. Why are you looking for it? It's nothing. I just remembered seeing it last time. - Dong Yi! - Chun Soo. You said it would be hard to get out for a while. What happened? I had an errand outside the Palace. Your expression seems a bit dark. Is something wrong? So you were looking for that butterfly accessory again? Yes, but I couldn't find it today either. I looked everywhere, but I haven't found it. I don't know if that Lady is still in the Palace. - Dong Yi, perhaps you should stop looking. - What? Don't you know how dangerous this is? What if they find out you're the Chief's....? Don't worry, Chun Soo. That won't happen. Dong Yi.... But even if it's dangerous for me, I have to find her. Why do you think I entered the Palace? It was to find the people responsible for the wrongful deaths of my father and brother. I'll handle that. I won't let you put yourself in danger! But I want to help too, Chun Soo. Dong Yi! Do you know how I lived for six years before you came back? It was always on my mind. The image of my father and brother being dragged away... The cliff top that was soaked in blood... I never forgot those images even for a day. I'm a Lady Investigator now. I can do it! So please don't tell me I can't do it. Dong Yi...! Yes.. yes... - Tell Her Highness I have arrived. - Yes, sir. Please go in. - Welcome! - Greetings, Your Highness! I heard you were appointed Chief of the Left Police Bureau. Congratulations! I have the Prince to thank for that! Do you want to see him? What a fine-looking baby he is! He is surely fit to be Crown Prince! Brother! I'm sure Lady Cho agrees with me. Don't you, My Lady? Yes, sir. - You may leave us. - Yes, Your Highness. Have you met with the Councilor? Yes, the Councilor and the South Faction is petitioning to appoint the baby as a Crown Prince. But the Dowager Queen is adamantly opposing it. And the West Faction is standing with her. That old fox is using her illness to control His Majesty. That is why he is unable to make up his mind. After the birth of the Prince, he promoted you to Royal Noble Consort Hui. But he hasn't said anything about appointing the Crown Prince. How is the Dowager Queen? I doubt she'll die anytime soon, so don't get your hopes up. But if His Majesty takes another Consort as she wishes, then it will be terrible for us. Why are you refusing all food and drink? You must recover quickly, Mother! If you care about me, then fulfill my wish. If you take another Consort, then I will get up right this very moment. A child born of that woman must never be Crown Prince! I won't allow that to happen while I'm still alive! All of our efforts will have been for nothing if the Prince isn't appointed Crown Prince. But what can we do? The Dowager Queen is using her illness as blackmail! She is insisting that it will not happen during her lifetime! Then perhaps we should shorten her lifetime. How can you be so crude? You're speaking before the Councilor! Forgive me if it offended your ears. However... If we just sit here and wait, we will not achieve what we want. You know His Majesty's character, don't you, Councilor? His Majesty will never appoint the Crown Prince... ... when his mother is so adamantly against it. - That's true. - That is why we must act. I'll take care of it. Please leave it to me. Leave it to you? What are you planning? You better not act foolishly and thwart our plans. Do as you wish. What is it? The Lady Investigators are searching our rooms! What? We have to search this room. Please go outside. All right. - My Lady! - You're here too? Yes, it's been a while. You should warned us before the search! That's the least you could have done for us! - I... - What is the matter here? Your Highness! The Office of Investigations is doing their inspections. What is this commotion? I told her off because I felt she was ungrateful. How can she do her duties if she had to worry about personal ties? Move aside. Yes, Your Highness. - It's been a while. - Yes, Your Highness. Have you been well? Yes, I have. You look like a proper Lady Investigator while you're working. - I should be careful too. - Your Highness, please don't say such things! Since you're here, stop by my chambers after you're finished. - Let's have some tea together. - Yes, Your Highness, I will. There's nothing interesting here. Let's move on. But you should look again, just in case. Yes, My Lady. That's strange. It's a prescription for the Baekchul Tonic. I wonder why it's in here. Your Majesty, are you unwell? You don't look good these days. I'm all right. Jong-Geum, go and fetch Lady Jung from the Office of Investigations. Yes, Your Majesty. - Why are you looking for Lady Jung? - I wanted to ask her something. My Lady, a palace maid from the Queen is here. From the Queen? I wonder why? - Send her in. - Yes, My Lady. - What is it? - The Queen would like to see you. All right. I'll go to her soon. You may leave. Why is Her Majesty looking for you? What's going on? I don't know. You must be glad. Lady Yu's been trying to get into Royal Consort Hui's graces... ... and now visits her often. And now the Queen wants to speak to you. What about me? I'm going now, so let the Chief Madam know. All right. Have a seat. - I wanted to consult you on something. - Yes, Your Majesty. But before that, I need you to swear an oath. I'm about to give you a task. You must carry it out secretly. Nobody must find out, even the Chief Madam Investigator. Can you do this for me? If this is your will, I will obey, Your Majesty. Then read this. Do you remember this? It's the Chrysanthemum tea I gave you when we first met. Yes, I remember it well, Your Highness. How could I forget? Yes, I recited Go Kyung-Myung's poem 'Yellow & White Chrysanthemum' Because I wanted to know what kind of person you were. I chose that poem randomly, But I can see now that it was the perfect poem for you. How shall I put it? You're like a white chrysanthemum that outshines even the yellow chrysanthemum. Your Highness, I do not deserve such words. Please don't say such things. No need to be so humble. To be honest, I knew you were intelligent, but I didn't expect you to be so exceptional. Sometimes I wonder if I did the right thing by giving you wings to fly. Your Highness...! What's wrong? Did I startle you with my words? But don't be overly concerned. I didn't say I regretted it. Isn't it fortunate for me that you are one of my people? That is what I'm trying to say. Drink your tea. It's getting cold. Yes, Your Highness. - Dong Yi. - Yes, My Lady. Lady Jung is looking for you. I understand what you're saying, but I don't think Dong Yi is suitable for this. But we need her abilities to do this task. I trust Dong Yi too, but she is one of Consort Hui's favorites. It will be difficult for her to be objective. - Did you ask to see me, My Lady? - I'll handle it. You may leave. - Have a seat. - Yes, My Lady. Today, the Queen asked to see me. - The Queen? - That's right. Her Majesty told me something that was shocking. Someone sent her a letter saying that... ... something is suspect with the Dowager Queen's tonic. Something is suspect? That means the tonic is the reason why the Dowager Queen is rapidly declining in health. You mean the tonic contains poison? It's not that simple. If the tonic has poison, then the physicians would know. The Queen has asked us to carry out the investigation in secret... ... because she fears it would cause chaos. I would like Jung Im and you to help me. Can you do it? If the letter is the truth, the culprit may even be Consort Hui. My Lady! You are aware of the conflict between Consort Hui and the Dowager Queen... ... regarding the Crown Prince. But that's impossible. Consort Hui would never do such a thing! I've been working at the Office of Investigations for a long time... ... and I've come to know this. People with great ambitions cannot be trusted. No, Consort Hui isn't a reckless person. Please leave it to me. I'll do it to prove Consort Hui's innocence. To be honest, I was opposed you for doing this. I understand why you did. What will you do if this is related to Consort Hui? That's impossible, but if it were, it mustn't go unpunished. If she really was behind this, it's unforgivable. Did the Royal Pharmacy buy anything else other than Rhino Horn and Black Cohosh? No, nothing else, My Lady. Are these all the herbs purchased by the Royal Pharmacy? Yes, My Lady. - Here you go, My Lady. - Thank you. - What did you find? - There wasn't anything interesting. There was nothing suspicious about the Rhino Horn Tonic prescribed to the Dowager Queen. This is a set-up. - You mean the Queen is...? - No, I'm not saying the Queen is responsible. I think someone is trying to frame Consort Hui. All right. I will inform Her Majesty that nothing was suspect. - Hey! Did you hear the news? - What is it? The Dowager Queen is in critical condition! She's in a coma and fighting for her last breath! - How bad is her condition? - I haven't been able to find that out yet. - Is the Royal Physician with her? - Yes, Your Majesty. What did you say? Mother has lost consciousness? The Royal Physician is with her but it seems she is in critical condition. Your Majesty! - We're going to see my mother now! - Yes, Your Majesty! Mother! Mother, I'm here! Please open your eyes! What has happened, My Queen? She hasn't regained consciousness, Your Majesty. I heard she was doing better. What happened! Her condition seemed to have improved. She even got up for a bit. But she suddenly collapsed while she was getting ready to visit you, Your Majesty! Mother...! His Majesty is at the Dowager Queen's chambers? Yes, Your Highness. Rumor has it that the Dowager Queen might pass away. What? Is that true? There was nothing wrong with her tonic? Yes, Your Majesty. I regret to tell you this is true. But her condition has deteriorated so rapidly. How could this have no cause? Brother! Where have you been? I even went to the Police Bureau! I had to go collect a dead body at Yichun. What happened? Dong Yi is looking for you! She's waiting at the Office of Investigations! The Office of Investigations? But I'm not permitted into the Palace. It'll be all right if I'm with you. Let's hurry! What's wrong? It's nothing. But that's a ferocious fist over there! - Chun Soo! - Dong Yi! Dong Yi! This is my brother who used to be a corpse-handler at the Police Bureau. What's wrong? I... I met him before, but I didn't know he was your brother. I came with Police Chief Suh to do some training here before. He was specially recognized by Chief Suh for his knowledge and ability while he was a corpse-handler. He is especially experienced with poison. - So will you help us? - Yes, My Lady. So have you found anything suspect? There is nothing amiss with the herbs or the prescription. Sorry to trouble you, Chun Soo. What is going on? The prescription and herbs you saw today... ... are for the Dowager Queen's tonic. So there's a problem with her tonic? Yes, her condition is critical right now. We've been investigating in case the problem is with the tonic. But so far it seems there's nothing wrong with it. Wait a moment, Dong Yi. There is nothing wrong with the Rhino Horn Tonic. But it could cause a problem if she also took another tonic with wolfsbane. What do you mean by that? Wolfsbane is incompatible with Rhino Horn and Black Cohosh. If someone is using these tonics to harm the Dowager Queen, You should find out if they used wolfsbane. - Tonics that use wolfsbane are... - They're lots of them. There's Gungang Tonic, Baekchul Tonic and... Wait! What did you just say? Baekchul Tonic? That's right. That's strange. It's a prescription for the Baekchul Tonic. I wonder why it's in here. If the letter is the truth, the culprit may even be Consort Hui. No... It can't be. That's impossible...! Well done. You've accomplished a great task. Your family outside the Palace will receive your reward. Thank you! Pass this letter to the medical officer. Yes, sir. My Lady! Dong Yi! What are you doing here? What did you just do? What... what..? What did you just give that medical officer?
