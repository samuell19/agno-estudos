Throw it. Goodbye. Take good care of yourself. Yes, Ibrahim. Tell me. -How much will you pay? -How much? I won’t pay anything. I brought potatoes. Hurry up! Customer is waiting! Bon appetit! Hello? Yes. Yes. Of course. When? Right away. Right away. What the fuck? This is more harmful! I swear it is more harmful. What is more harmful? This is a vapor cigarette. Dude... ...except for oxygen nothing should be inhaled by a human lung. -Am I right? -Of course. -Zafer. -Yes? By the way, this is a device. -A device? -It is a tool. This is a piece of equipment. Do you have a licence to carry it? What is this? -This is a mechanism. -Mechanism. This needs to be good for something. You are only sucking it. Ridiculous! Do you know what this is? You come to my house and walk into my living room... ...see me sucking the coffee table. It is the same thing. I don’t want to see such a thing. The coffee table? Does my father know? That I smoke? No, your relationship with furniture. Fuck off! Are you cursing big-head? He got it all wrong. Come upstairs. Dinner is ready. -Come on, dinner is ready. -Come on. What are we having? Don’t you know what you’ve been cooking all day long? I don’t know which dish she’ll be serving. Atakan, do we buy these potatoes from Ibrahim? -Where should we get them? -Don’t buy them from Ibrahim again. Pour some more. -What happened? -It tastes like bread. Customers don’t like it either. I will kick the shit out of Ibrahim but there is a time for everything. What happened? Why do you want to beat him? I don’t like him. Guys, today is the 5th anniversary of Merve’s death. May God bless her. In her honour, deep fry fritters in syrup and serve them to the customers. Atakan, don’t forget it. Okay. Guys... ...we have a new order. It is something like a birthday party. There are going to be six people. No fuss! It is happening tomorrow afternoon around 4pm. Oktay has the file. Let him tell you. Serhan, Zafer, Serbest,... ...Sevil and I. Atakan will pick us up at 1pm. We’ll go to the venue right away. We will serve hot appetizers and main courses. We are not responsible of drinks and desserts. There will be two bar tables. Sevil and I will be taking care of the gas range. Zafer and Serhan will be serving. Serbest will be coordinating. -Six people, clear-cut? -Clear-cut. First, we’ll serve the hot appetizers,... ...then the cake will arrive, candles will be blown out... ...then we’ll serve the main course. -There is one more thing. -Yes. Everyone will wear a name tag. Are we going to wash the dishes? No. We are not responsible of that. How is the menu going to be like? It is a birthday party. So, we can... We will make three kinds of appetizers. I had made a finger sandwich for you. That one is good. I will make Russian salad. Okay. Do we have to make meatballs? No need. We have schnitzel and rice. Okay. Fine, that’s more than enough. İlhami? Do I have to give you a ride every night? Asshole, we live nearby. It is not that you carry us on your back. My car is at the repair shop. I was supposed to get it back in two days. -Is it still in the repair shop? -Yes. You didn’t take your medicine after dinner. I did. I put it in my pocket. I will drink it in the car. I left a water bottle in the car this morning. I left a plastic bottle of water. You have amazing organizational skills. I am telling you. You are always a step ahead. Gentlemen, iron your shirts,... ...Serbest, don’t forget the name tags. We also have to wear white gloves. Iron them, okay? They can’t be ironed. They are made of nylon. Iron will burn hole and melt the fabric. Cover it with a cloth then iron it... ...or at least wash it. Okay! It has dissolved already. It hasn’t. If it doesn’t dissolve, it won’t enter my bloodstream. We can go. Wait a minute! I am getting out. -What happened? -I will call you. You can go. What happened? You are great at pissing someone off. You are quite a girl. It is hard to find a girl that you can have a great conversation with. I’ve found you. I won’t let you go. Am I making myself clear? Please make time for me. I would love to meet up. Why don’t you also invite that friend of yours? No, not that one. You should kick her out of your life. She is ridiculous. She is a loser with curly hair and red glasses. Does she look like someone you can hang out with? I am not saying this to restrict you. Am I making myself clear? I am ironing as we speak. Do you want to hang up? We could talk a little bit more. Okay. Did I call you? Did you call me? I called you. Okay. Then you hang up. See you. -You are here for the birthday party? -Yes. -Mr. Tuzun? -They are coming. Go ahead. Let’s set up the buffet on both sides. Mr. Tuzun and his friends may want to rest for a little while when they come back. We should start serving alcohol by then. Birthday cake will be cut around 7pm. When should we start the dinner? They are hunting right now. They may want to eat what they hunted. Hunting? Can you hunt here? Hunting? Are we going to cook them as well? No, that’s not your responsibility. Even if they don’t eat what you brought, you will still be paid. Can you make it on time? It will be on time. It was a great hunt. Hello. What’s up, Tinaz? That huge animal saw you but you didn’t see him. I’ll play you some music. Did you like it? Mr. Tuzun, if you like, we can start serving. Okay. Right away. Mr. Tinaz, we can get started. Will you be sitting there? And you won’t get up from there, right? Seating arrangement is crucial for us. We weren’t told so. We thought there would be six people. You are too many. We are stressed out. We need to organize it well. It is your birthday, I am sorry but... ...we have to serve better. You serve Mr. Tuzun and his friends over there. Zafer and Serhan. You take care of that area. Sevil will watch out the exit. You watch out the door. What shall I do? I will serve these gentlemen here. Are we good to go? Good. Let’s begin. One, two, three... ...four, five, six, seven... Serbest, wait a minute. One, two, three... Hold on for a second! Turn that music off! What the hell is this? Butler is missing. Dude, butler is missing. What happened? I couldn’t do it. Why not? Target is not stable and there is the distance... You can’t shoot him from this distance. Stop trying. What is going on Oktay? What kind of an assignment is this? Eleven men! They came from hunting. They were armed. We could have died there. We could have died. Do you realize that? They could have whooped our asses. I specifically asked you... ...if there were only six people or not. You told me it was clear-cut. Okay. There were eleven men. What could we have done if... ...these men had brought their wives and kids? Then we would stop the operation. Baloney! What would you say to the headquarters? Nobody would take his wife and kid to hunting. I come with you. That’s not what I am talking about. What’s that got to do with it? Why do you compare yourself with that man’s wife? Who is that man’s wife? Get it together. What are we doing? One of those men tried to reach to his double barreled rifle... ...if Sevil hadn’t seen him, three of us would have been dead by now. What the hell is this? This is ridiculous. We never have intelligence failure! Never! Okay! Hold on, be quiet. We will talk about this. I will tell my father as well. Enough! It is over! Cut it out! Who prepared these name tags? I did. What the hell is this? Why do you name yourself Bekir but call me Tinaz? What the hell is Tinaz? Tinaz? If he had asked my name, I wouldn’t have been able to tell him. I would have said Tirpan or Tarzan... ...or Tarkan for that matter! You named a 45 year old woman Maya! Would he believe that? You are fannying around. I see you are creative and eager but... ...you are talking about an intelligence failure... ...and that people are making mistakes. What the hell is going on with you? We have to get it together, we have to be more dynamic,... ...we need to be vigilant and more upbeat. He named me Cangar. Like a puma cub. What are you doing? Open the window. This is amazing. Send me the link, I will watch it right away. Okay, hang up. See you. Excuse me! What is the wi-fi password? Okay. U. Excuse me? U! The letter U! Write two more U’s! First one is lower case U, second one is capital letter U. One J. Three 3s. -You mean three 3s. -Yes. Three figures of 3. Write the third 3 in lower case. What do you mean by that? Soft G. 6 A. K. Lower case H. 6 million. -What kind of a password is this? -Right down. 2 billion. 2 million in writing. Why don’t you want to give me the password? We are downloading something. You are downloading something. A friend of mine recommended this place,... ...she talked a lot about it. I was curious so I came. Is this the way you treat a customer? Great. They are downloading something. Next time, you will charge people. See you! Have a nice day. Looking forward to seeing you again. Why are you being an asshole? I don’t like him. What do you mean you don’t like him? Do you know this man? -Who? -That man. How do you know him? We have a common friend. Itir is his-- -Itir? -No. -What? -No. -What is that? -What? What is that? Do you have a girlfriend? No, how did you come up with that? Serbest, I will fuck you up if you have a girlfriend. Don’t be ridiculous. You are upsetting me. There is no girlfriend! Please! Does your father know? Shall I swear on my mother’s grave? There is no girlfriend! Serbest... ...you can’t screw with... ...this family’s number one rule. -What are you talking about? -What are you talking about? Lower your hand! -What are you talking about? -Put your hand in your pocket! Put your hand in your pocket! Put your hand in your pocket! -Do you see-- -Put your hand in your pocket! -...what he is saying to me? -Put your hand in your pocket! What is he talking about? Son, you are brothers. Are you crazy? Watch your tongue. Don’t be ridiculous. -Walk away! -Get the fuck out of here! This is a workplace! This is a workplace! Don’t be ridiculous! Radicchio. Write down. Radicchio. Get it together! We had only one customer today. Write down. Garden sorrel. Lettuce. Don’t do such things. I am fed up. I am so fed up. I am really so fed up. Write down. 4 packets of arugula. Everyone is here. This is a small but a very important assignment. It involves a motorcycle courier. He is carrying a bag. On Thursday between 2pm and 2.15pm... ...he will be passing through... ...the exit ramp. We will set a trap there. We will take down the courier and get the bag. I want you to be careful. That bag is very important. We will leave the courier where we took him down. We’ll keep the bag. May we not fail! This guy delivers pita! Fuck! Run dude, run! He is going too fast. I can’t believe this. There is no way we can catch up with a motorcycle like that... ...while driving a minivan like ours. Don’t shout at me! Atakan, speed up. Floor the gas pedal. How can I floor it? The man is riding a motorcycle. Did you steal that guy’s pita? He died and you got hungry. -Bastard! -Stay alert. Where is your mask? I threw it away during my moment of anger. Please take this mask issue seriously. Please! Please! What does it have to do with frivolity? I happened to throw it away. Should I go and take it back? You thought about your moment of anger, then you realized how hungry you were. You probably figured out you could eat that guy’s pita. Step on the gas. Some things are meant to happen and some things are not. We can’t possibly pull this job with this van. Don’t you see how fast he is going? Step on the gas, Atakan! There is no way. There is no way. Forget it. You are dreaming. Serbest, shut up! He stopped at the traffic lights. What should we do? You stop as well. Zafer! Zafer! Are you crazy? Come here. Zafer, come! Are you crazy? Don’t get me mad! Are we going to kill a man in a city? We will kill him somewhere quiet. Oktay! Our commercial is playing on the radio. Anatolian flavours 1071! It is located at the historical Haydarpasa train station... ...in Kadikoy, one of the gems of Istanbul,... -...where East meets West... -I wrote the script. It is beautifully written. It sounds great. It is truly beautiful. We introduce you to the tasteful cuisine... ...at the historical Haydarpasa train station... ...in Kadikoy, one of the gems of Istanbul,... ...where East meets West. Please call us... ...to witness a unique cuisine and... ...experience fairy tale flavours. You can reach us at 0216-- -Have you arrived? -I have. What’s up? I fell asleep. Did you watch a movie? Yes, I didn’t understand it and I fell asleep half way through it. Did something happen? I have to tell you something. We should stop seeing each other for a while. I don’t know how long. Of course, I love you so much. I love you so much. I am head over heels in love with you. It is okay but... ...you come and go without a notice... -...I mean, this is unusual. -Okay. -Okay, Serhan. We’ll stop seeing each other. -How come? Okay. We’ll stop seeing each other. You jumped at the chance. What did I jump at, Serhan? You tell me to stop seeing each other. I say okay. Let everything be as you wish. You still haven’t introduced me to your family anyway. You told me you had brothers. I haven’t seen any of them. You never invited me to your restaurant. You tell me not to call you after 11pm... ...so I don’t. You tell me you’ll be gone for 5-6 days and that I should be going along with it... ...so I go along with it. You tell me your family is conservative and they wouldn’t approve this relationship... ...and I accept all that. Now you tell me we should stop seeing each other for a while. We don’t really see each other, Serhan. You mind my coming unannounced. I don’t know what to do. You are like a ghost. What are we doing? What should I do? I will give birth by myself. All by myself, like a cat. We’ll talk later. You’ll send me a Facebook message. Giving birth? How come? What does she mean by giving birth? Zafer, what are you wearing on your head? Which one? That’s a plastic bag. It is the plastic bag I got from the pita guy. Ayvaz pita. Thank God, that guy you shot is alive. Good. He didn’t see who shot him. But... ...you couldn’t knock off the courier. He ran away. In that case, you couldn’t take the bag. Oktay,... ...why do I send you... ...as the team leader? Why do I do that? Dad, our problem is that courier turned out to be a pita guy. We need to stop... ...put our thinking cap on and ask ourselves. Where did we go wrong? Are you an amateur? Is it your first time on a job? If I had gathered some random men on the street... ...they could have pulled it off way better. Do you know what is going to happen tomorrow? They will fine us. For sure. No. An inspector is coming from the headquarters tomorrow. I repeat. From the headquarters. This data is also coming... ...from the headquarters. So, we are screwed. What time are they coming? Why? Do you have other plans? No. Is anyone hurt? Fine. Have something to eat. What happened? I just came here. -Why? -Nothing. Let’s walk. Do you have a prior arrangement? No. -Do you have something to do? -No. -Let’s play a car race. -What? A car race? -Do you have something to do? -No, I don’t. Come on then,... ...let’s play. -I don’t want to. -Why? How are you? I am fine. What are you doing? Have you slept? I am watching series. -What are you watching? -It is none of your business! -Let’s watch it together. -I don’t want to. If you don’t have anything else to say, I’ll close the door. -I love you. -What? I love you. So? I mean... If you don’t have anything else to say, I’ll close the door. There are things I can tell and there are things I can’t. Great. Then why did you come? Because I love you. Begum, can you open the door? -I have to tell you something. -Shut up. -What? -I really love you-- What is this? I am getting angry. As you know, we let a certain margin of error... ...during these operations. Your family earned a 2% success rate. It is quite remarkable. But in this final operation... ...the acceptable margin of error... ...has been exceeded. I’ve read the reports. We saw there were reasons... ...beyond your control. We have been a grand organization... ...for a thousand years because... ...we don’t let anything pose a risk. As you may appreciate-- Wait a minute, Mr. Gazanfer. I didn’t come here to discuss this matter. There is an information leakage in this family. We have pinpointed that. As a matter of fact, certain civilians... ...became familiar with many facts they weren’t supposed to know. This has been going on for six months. Has the information been leaking from our family? First of all, welcome. I would like to tell you that... ...in organizations like ours... ...information leakage... ...is an unacceptable scandal. Especially a grand organization... ...that has been influencing.... ....many places all around the world... ...with its deeply rooted... How can I put it? Today... ...when we look at places... ...like United States and Europe... ......where the very old trees live-- Is this the final information? It is not, Mr. Gazanfer. I mean it that way. That’s why we brought... ...a very strong chemical. It is not poisonous. It is reinforced... ...sodium penthanol. It removes all the barriers in a human mind. You can’t lie when you drink it. I am sure you have a suitable place for this. I’d like to get started with the interrogation. Please drink the medicine. Take three deep breaths. Deep. Your name? Ilhami Ozturk. -Your last name? -Ozturk. First, I look at a man to see... ...if he is worthy or not. Then I do what I have to do. That’s a given. That’s my personality. Something is happening to me. I am being serious. What... ...happened? Is it too hot in here? Am I having a hormonal imbalance? Should I have another one? It didn’t affect me at all. There is no effect. What is the active substance in this? It makes me feel good. There is a substance in it... ...that makes me feel good... ...both medically and mentally. You mean my life? There are certain secrets in this family... ...there are certain problems within this family... I don’t have a girlfriend. Exactly, right now... ...sometimes mutual and sometimes one-sided... ...when I try to beat around the bush... ...she bombards me with questions. She is asking who the leader of the organization is... ...or how many people I’ve killed so far. One day I told her that we were a part of the organization... ...and that we were very rich... ...I mumbled something like... ...how we kill people all the time. I told her to stop by at our restaurant. I told her we have superb home cooked meals... ...and that she should taste them. So on and so forth. Then it dawned on me. Our cover will be blown. I got so scared. She has this silly friend. She mentioned him about us. One day her friend came... ...I was so scared I almost pooped my pants. I treated him badly. I kicked him out. I kicked the man out of the restaurant. That’s how I saved our asses. My password is love. But I also use violence... ...as an instrument when it is necessary. I wanted her to see that. It was all for the girl. Am I making myself clear? Let’s be open to one another. These interrogations, these gases and all... You are simply showing off. For example... ...if I didn’t want to be collaborative,... ...no matter what you did,... ...would you be able to get a single word out of my mouth? No way! What we have here is... ...mutual respect, love and a relationship. I’ve been told that... ...I have 21 million dollars in my bank account. Thank you. I wanted to drink fruit juice the other night, I couldn’t. I wanted to drink fruit juice the other night and I couldn’t. I am sorry but... ...fuck this long-established organization. Fuck this long-established organization. Tell me inspector. What am I doing? I am killing men. Men! I have 24 liras in my pocket. Right now. What am I doing? I am killing men. Fuck your interrogation. Fuck off! What is this exaggerated swagger all about? What are you doing? My father’s dick is like a coke can. Don’t you dare to take me on! I swear. Don’t you make that mistake! I am ready to explode! It is unbearable. I swear every night... Thank you for your cooperation. Everyone should know their place! We have unseen lines. I know. These lines... Our plane is leaving in two hours,... ...so let’s cut to the chase. We have to host Mr. Serbest in the headquarters... ...for further interrogation. Can’t we take care of this here? Take care of what? Interrogation. Mr. Gazanfer, as you know... ...I am obliged to do as I’ve been told. What did you do? Why did you shoot them? He didn’t say anything. He said he was going to take me in for interrogation. He didn’t say anything. He wasn’t going to interrogate you. Moron! I am almost 60 years old,... ...I still haven’t seen the headquarters. -Oktay. -Yes, dad. Pack them up and get them out of the way. -Let’s get out and talk. -Okay. Lock the door. He should have told me. Why did he use the word “interrogation”? He should have told me directly. Son,... ...it is sugar coding for execution. His phone is ringing. What are we going to do? Don’t touch it. We might gain some time. What are we doing now? We will run away. All of us? -Ilhami. -Yes? How much time do you think we have? They will figure out what happened to these men in an hour. They will load the team on a plane in an hour and a half. Are they coming from abroad? Of course. They can’t find a hitman in Turkey. They wouldn’t want to. In four hours or so, they will arrive. All hell will break loose. Dad,... ...we can’t gather 10G. Money situation is tricky. We have money. We are fine. Where is it? -Oktay. -Yes, dad? Explain. Our father has been saving money... ...from the operational expenses. How long? We have almost 2 million. -Liras? -Dollars. Dollars. They will highjack the bank. We can’t get that money. It is not in the bank. It is in a private vault. I have the password. -Ilhami? -Yes? Take photos of everyone and... ...take them to Arif. Tell him to make passports. Take all the necessary paperwork with you. -Can we get it done on time? I don’t know. -It has to be done on time, Ilhami! If it comes down to it, threaten him. I am going to go crazy. I am losing my mind. Look what happened in just 10 minutes. This is incredible! We are way too skint but we are going to Ukraine. Shut up! This happened because of you! What happened because of me? What happened because of me? Did I tell my father to shoot those men? Did I tell my father to shoot those men? Okay, I could have gone to interrogation! Enough! We are screwed! Did you happen to save me? Did you happen to save me? Sevil is fucked for life... ...Oktay is fucked for life. Serbest! You are fucked for life. I am fucked for life. -We are all fucked! -There is this woman. -We are way too skint. -There is this woman. If I get into a cab, I will be out of money half way through. There is this woman! There is this woman! He is telling the truth! Oktay. You have been cursing in Sevil’s presence. That’s not what I am talking about. There is a woman in my life! In which life? I have a girlfriend. You have a woman in your life, what did I have in mine? A bat? Does she know about us? -Did you tell her everything just like this idiot? -No. They will kill her. You know that, right? They will take her hostage... ...to threaten us. We’ll take her with us. I beg you. -Please. -What the hell are you talking about? What the hell are you talking about? Listen up. There is a country cottage in Silivri. A chopper will come there tomorrow morning... ...at 5.30am and pick us up. There is cargo steamer... ...it is in Black Sea right now. That chopper will throw us onto the cargo steamer. Then we will go to port of Odessa. Everything has been arranged. Let’s take care of the last-minute details. Okay? Dad,... ...Serhan has a girlfriend. Great. I am sorry to hear that. Dad,... ...she is pregnant. That’s the situation. They glazed the donut. He can leave as if nothing happened... ...but she will have to face the consequences. Child will be an orphan. She will be a widow. How can she work? How can she take care of her child? If you do grocery shopping, it costs at least 50 liras. Let’s assume she breastfeeds for two years. What is going to happen after that? Where can that child get protein? Let’s assume he got protein from lentil. Lentil, chickpeas, pulses. They are all imported goods. They are being brought by trucks. Oil is priced in dollars. 1 dollars is equal to 4 liras-- What is her name? Begum. How long have you been together? For a year. Do you love her? Very much. Where is she? She must be home. Ilhami, go to Arif’s hotel... ...and take care of the passports. Wait until he gets them done. Oktay,... ...you take the kids,... ...go and pick Begum up from her home. You go to the vault and get the money. After you get the money, meet up with Ilhami. Don’t go home. Take your SIM cards out and burn them. No more speaking on the phone. Get as many weapons as you can, Atakan. Take small things with you. Don’t carry anything that is heavy. -Should I take M60? -Is M60 small? Don’t take it then. If nobody else has a secret lover, an affair or... ...an illegitimate child, let’s get going. How does your relationship become tragic just because I have safe sex? Have safe sex. I have to tell you something. We don’t have anything to wear. I had yellow shorts. Where are they? How am I supposed to know where your shorts are? It is going to get cold soon. What are we going to do in Ukraine during those cold days? We’ll freeze there. I can’t stand cold weather. We’ll do some shopping. Okay? Calm down. Okay. Fine. Take care of everything. When you are done,... ...come and pick us up from the bazaar after it gets dark. We’ll travel in the same car. Okay, son? Okay. -Where? -Who is where? Where is Begum? -What are you going to do with her? -Get out of my way. Begum, come. Welcome. Seyyal Taner. -Excuse me? -Seyyal Taner. Meaning? Where is Arif? We don’t call him by his real name anymore. What? We don’t call Arif by his real name anymore. You don’t call Arif by his real name anymore. Dickweed! That’s why we say Seyyal Taner. We call him Beduk from now on. -What? -Beduk. -Who? -Beduk. -What are you saying? -Beduk. -What the hell is that? -An up-and-coming singer. He is a human? Yes. Call him. Dracula. Yes, this is butterfly. Okay. I am sending him up. Room 411. -What? -411. -What are you saying? -411. 411. 411. We forgot to ask everyone’s shoe sizes. We don’t have a phone either. We’ll make an educated guess. You’ll buy something for my feet. They will all fit. Where are we exactly... ...going right now? First of all,... ...we’ll go to the building where the vault is. First task. After we withdraw the money... ...we have about 2 million dollars there. Actually, we had 20 million but they seized it. Oktay could barely scratch together... ...2 million from the operational costs. After we get the money, we’ll meet up Ilhami and... ...in order to get the passports we need to make a payment to Arif. -What are you talking about? -How come? What are you talking about? Fake passport. Who the hell... ...are you? -Who are you? -Okay. I don’t know you. -Are these your brothers? -Yes, they are. -Why are you staring at me like an idiot? -Watch your mouth. -Begum! -Who the hell are you? We are professional killers! Okay? For fuck’s sake. We are professional killers! We kill people for money! We’ve been killing people for a thousand years. The restaurant is a cover up. Serbest is also killing people. So is Zafer and so am I. We fucked the men who gave us this job. That’s why we are running away. You got it? You got it now? What are you saying, Serhan? What do you mean you are killing men? Do you realize what you are saying? Is this even possible? -I want to get off. -No, no. Can you stop the car? -Tell him to stop the car. -You are not getting off. I will get off! Get off! Damn it! Let her get off! Calm down. Drive. You kidnapped me. Are you in the mafia? No, we are not. What’s that got to do with it? Begum... ...for God’s sakes... ...that’s why I have been acting weird all this time. I didn’t want things to end up like this. It is serious. We are running away. I swear, we are going to quit killing people. I swear on my mother’s grave, we are going to quit. Please. -Serhan, are you serious? -Yes! -Are you telling me the truth? -Yes! What do you mean? Is this even possible? If you leading this kind of life,... ...why do you jeopardize other people’s lives? How can you jeopardize my life? You have no right to do so. That is the exact reason! We are not allowed to fall in love. We are not allowed to have a relationship. Rules date back a thousand years. What can I do? We are going through this because I am head over heels in love with you. I am taking both my family and the organization on. Don’t you understand my situation? I won’t have this child, Serhan. I won’t give birth to this child. -Begum. -I won’t give birth. Begum. I’ve killed as long as I can remember. I have a chance of giving life to someone this time. Just this once. Please don’t take that away from me. Please. Can we stop by at Itir’s place? I beg you. She lives nearby. All I need is 30 seconds or 5 minutes. We’ve made a plan. To hell with your Itir. I beg you. Please. She lives nearby. She lives in that alley. Let’s go... ...if she wants to, she’ll come. Please. No way. Oktay... ...I’ve killed as long as I can remember. I have a chance of giving life to someone this time. Just this once. Don’t take that away from me. Fuck off! Stop hovering! Take this file. We need eight passports. Okay, bro. Come and pick them up next week. -What? -Next week. -Next week? -We have three or four hours. There are things I can do... ...then there are things I can’t. This is not one of those jobs. This is different. What is going on? Things got messed up. I can’t do it in three hours. Four? Not possible? It is not possible. Even the most talented one can’t do it. My dear Itir. What are you doing here? Get your bag and passport,... ...we have to run away. Russians are after us. Everyone knows about our relationship. What are you talking about? What relationship? Haven’t I told you so many times? We are not in restaurant business. We are professional killers. You know that. What do you want from me, Serbest? Sod off! Go and get ready. Sod off! Come on. Aren’t you coming? We can stop the car if you want. We can wait. What should we do? Should we get going? Whatever. Keep driving. Welcome Mr. Mermer. Please say your password at once. Mermer Merve. Mermer Merve. Merver Mermer. The password is incorrect. Please try again. I chose your deceased sister in law’s name as a password. Last name as a first name. Yes. Why do you have to say it three times? You could have said it once. I wanted it to be difficult. It is very difficult like this. Please say your password. This sounded different. It didn’t work. Why didn’t you choose my mother’s name? Shut up for a second! You are saying it now. Should we record it then play it? Good idea. Give me the phone. -We burned the phones. -Right. Please say your password. The password is incorrect. -We won’t be able to withdraw the money. -It is not working. Should you put something in your mouth and try again for a better articulation? A pencil,... ...a fava bean? A branch. It is not working. Maybe it’s got something to do with his voice. Why are you singing to the vault? I said it to set an example. -It won’t recognize his voice. -I wanted it to sound about right. Okay. Hold on! Shut up! It would give us the money, if it could. It is all good. I can’t believe this. Don’t sweat over it. Has it started? What has started? Food cravings. What are you going to do? We can find some sour plums. Mulberry? Do you crave for sour things? Shut up. Serhan! Where have you been? -Plans have changed. Just go. -How come? -We couldn’t withdraw the money. -What are we going to give to Arif? -We’ll put it on our tab. -What the hell is going on? My deceased sister in law pocket the money. -What? -Vault didn’t give us the money. Open the window, Atakan. What have we done? He will be done in an hour. Arif is taking care of it. Come, dear. Begum? Begum. Welcome. I am Ilhami. I am like an uncle to them. Good luck with everything! We wouldn’t want anything... ...to end up like this... ...but it did. It did. I wouldn’t want anything to end up like this, either. I am living a nightmare right now. I hope nobody is offended. -No, no. -Not at all. Not at all! What the hell? There is a problem. What? What? What happened to the money? Speak up! What the fuck is going on? -I am sorry, my daughter. -Don’t worry. They couldn’t get the money. We came right here. How come? What are we going to say to Arif? We’ll take care of that. It is not a problem. I already yelled at him. If we tell him to do it for free, we might as well kill him. You take care of it. Okay. I will take care of him. Ilhami and I are going upstairs. Have a quick look around and follow us. Don’t stand around like a lemon. Room number is 411. -What? -411! What don’t you understand? -Are you alright? -Serhan, stop. It is clear. We call this “having a quick look around”. We look around to make sure if anyone is hiding. I got that much. Am I an idiot? No! Not a bit. Not everyone can know about this. It is a technical term. Having a quick look around. We made a huge mistake by getting on this elevator. -We made a stupid mistake. -Why? We got on this elevator like a bunch of idiots. -What is going on, dude? -What do you mean what is going on? Nothing is as it seems in this hotel. Didn’t you realize? -There is nothing wrong with this elevator. -How come? Isn’t it too slow? It is taking hours to go up. -Is it too slow? -I thought its speed was fine. Speed of this elevator is fine but there were two men at the entrance. Who were they? Did you pay attention? -I thought they were women. -Were they women? -They were women. -Were they women? They were women. Two of them were women and the other one was a guy. There were three of them. Regular people. -What was that painting all about? -What painting? -The one with the eagle. -What was wrong with that? It conveyed too much meaning. How come? -Two eagles are standing back to back. -Weird. There were planets... ...and lightnings behind them. -I think it conveyed too much meaning. -What is that supposed to mean? Is that a sign? I’ve never seen an elevator like this. I don’t feel well right now. I am like a cat on a hot tin roof. -You got us in here. -I got you in here? Who got us in here? Did I come here by myself? -Push the stop button. -We are in between floors. -We’ll get off once we level with floor. -Have we levelled with floor? We haven’t reached there yet. Let’s get off. There is a wall. We could have taken the stairs. -Push the stop button. -We could have taken the stairs. What are you going to do? Are you going to stand inside this elevator? We are not there yet. We haven’t reached there yet. We haven’t reached the second floor. -Are you crazy, Serbest? -We couldn’t go up one floor. Shut up! What are you doing to me? I think I am not making myself clear. Oktay. You know how this is done. I have people to report to. I report what I do or what I buy. I am at least... ...doing a job that is 100.000 dollars worth. We are importing this chip. You tell me you don’t have money. What am I going to tell them? I have to take that money from you. I finished all your passports in three hours. I did the impossible. You tell me you don’t have money. What am I going to tell them? Am I going to say you’ll pay in instalments? They will fuck us with no questions asked. Okay. I got it! I got it. This is not my first job. I am telling you I will give your money. I will! Enough already! Shame on you! You are being disgraceful to my father. These men know us. The ones who don’t know us have heard about us. We are Mermer family. Arif! What should we do now? Should we get these passports and leave after we shoot you... ...or should we wait until you comprehend us? I need to make a quick phone call. Please. -I spoke to him. He will take care of this. -Okay. Arif! Arif is gone. How come he is gone? Arif is not here. He is gone. Lie down on the floor! Okay. Get up. -Did you get the passports? -I did. We are getting out. Be calm but hurry up. Come on. We should lie down and get up many times during the day. Easy, easy. Everybody put on a silencer. Serbest, Zafer. Take this floor. Ilhami, let’s clear this area. We’ll kill everything on our way. Don’t go anywhere. Protect the girl. Be calm, okay? You’ll come down at my signal. Come on. Be calm. Come on. Be calm, Begum. I got so scared. May God damn you, Serhan! It is perfectly fine. I am also so scared. Listen to me. Do you know what I do in times like these? -What do you do? -What is your favorite film? My favorite film. “Eyes Wide Shut” Okay. Hum the score of that film. Shostakovich. How can I hum Shostakovich? Think of a local film. I am very picky. I am very picky when it comes to movies. There is Metin Erksan. How about “Time to Love”? What are you talking about, my love? -I am so scared. -Okay. Calm down. -Good day. -Good day. -You must be feeling refreshed. -Thank you. Go ahead. Go in. I was 13 years old when I pulled the trigger for the first time. I did as I’ve been told since that day. They pointed a target and I pulled the trigger. So did my grandfather and father. But today, for the first time... ...I killed for my family. All I know is that... ...you can’t retire from this job. I have reached a certain age... ...I expect Oktay to take care of the operation... ...so that I can take a back seat and collect my money. Then Oktay will wait for Serhan to take over... ...so he can retire. What I am trying to say is... ...this job had to come to an end somehow. My grandfather couldn’t do it. My father couldn’t do it. It was supposed to be today. Let’s get me a goose down coat. Okay. Let’s get the best one. You see what we’ve been up against. Go away! What are you doing here? Serhan,... ...Zafer, Serbest. We are leaving. Come on. Come, my daughter. How are you? Fine, fine. What did you do? Not much. What did you do? -The usual. Thank God. -Fine, fine. -Where is Serbest? -He was upstairs. He’ll be here any minute. What do you mean he was upstairs? He went one way, I went another. There were two men. We shared them. Why did you leave him alone? We went in separate directions. Are you crazy, are you out of your mind? Are you a bunch of idiots? No offence but... ...fuck the way you handle a job. May God damn each and every one of you. May God damn you all! May God damn you all! You let me get beaten by... ...a monstrous man for half an hour. He kicked me, he slapped me... ...he knocked me over with flying kicks. He even beat me with the back of his neck. He beat me with every inch of his body. Nobody asked me... ...if I needed help. The man broke everything with my body. He broke the wardrobe, night stand,... ...towels and pillows. He choked me and... ...he threw me against the wall. He choked me then threw me against the wall. I screamed for help. Assholes! Not even a single person showed up! Am I not a part of this family? Am I not a part of this family? Nobody asked me what I was doing up there. Aren’t we at the same hotel? Tell me Ilhami... ...am I in another city? Did I get beaten in a different place? Did I get beaten somewhere far away and come back here? We are in the same place! We are on the same floor! Shame on you! Are you alright? Turn around. Turn around? Are you going to recognize me if I turn around? He turned me into another person by beating me. You made me kill a man with a mop. You made me kill a man with a mop. Are you alright? I am fine. Thank you. Guys, shall we get going? Come on. Split up. Go to the upper floors. Serbest, come this way. I think there are three of them. Two of them are behind the cabinet. One of them is standing on the left of the reception desk. On my left or on your left? He is on the left. It doesn’t differ whether he is on your left or mine. It differs. For example,... ...this is my left. Your left is another left. They are behind you. If they are behind me... ...this is my left. If you turn left to shoot them, they will be on your left-hand side. We are here today because... ...left was divided... ...into fractions within itself. Look,... ...get it together. Please. Zafer, throw a smoke bomb! What is this? Come on. Come on. Serhan, go on a shooting spree! Go on a shooting spree. Watch out. You are not shooting right. Reload your gun. Good. Now go on a shooting spree. -What do you mean by that? -Excuse me? You made a comment. I thought you weren’t aiming right. They are still not down. -Those vehicles are armour-plated. -That is why. -Because they are armour-plated. -Okay. You can aim at the tyres. Can you do that? -Why do you misunderstand? -You shouldn’t. He is offended. I swear I am not offended. I am sorry. That’s not what I am saying. You are older than me. You go on a shooting spree. I am taking it all back... ...if you got me wrong. You go on a shooting spree. If we are getting into a fight against each other, I will withdraw. No, no. There is no such thing. I made that comment based on what I saw from over here. Go ahead. I could shoot this much. -Did I do wrong? -No. Please, go ahead. To hell with you and your shooting! -I am being misunderstood. -Can you keep shooting? I am sorry but I started disliking it. Can someone else take over? You are doing a great job. Continue. Whatever! Where are you? What have you done, dad? What happened to the car? Don’t ask. We could barely get ourselves here. We were dying. They sent armed men to Arif’s place. There were too many to kill. -We are devastated. -Is everyone here? -Nobody has an injury or anything, right? -We are fine. They beat the shit out of Serbest. Dad, I got two pieces of bad news. I have one piece of bad news... ...and another piece of bad news which is even worse. What have you done? Let’s get going. I will tell you on the way. Here are... ...the passports. We bought some nice outfits. They are all in the bags. This is mine. How come? It is mine. I don’t wear every label. Red. -This is mine, Serhan. -It is very beautiful. Your sister in law knows the best outfit to pick. I have to tell you something,... ...I need to go to the bathroom. We’ll stop soon. You’ll go there. It is not that. Atakan,... ...can you drive back home? No, no. We are not going home. They have men back there. He needs to hold it as much as he can. I need to go home. You know that, too. No way, you can’t go home. There is no going back home! Forget about home. -Forget about home. -Don’t shout at me. Are you going to get us screwed? Shameless! Hold it and pass out. We’ll pick it up in Ukraine. What are you picking up? Zafer, no! Not in a million years! I have to go. You know that. You know my situation. I don’t get it. What situation? I have obsessive compulsive disorder. They all know that. I can only go to the bathroom in my house. They all know about it! I can’t touch velvet, I can’t lick a balloon. What are we doing now, uncle Gazanfer? Should I drive home? -Go ahead. -We can’t do that! -We are screwed! -This is unbelievable. Fuck your ass! Zafer? Faruk? What have you done? You shot Faruk. What are you doing? We didn’t see anything. If you didn’t see anything, why did you shoot? You have to be careful. I will take a look inside. Where are you going? The man is dead. Brother Faruk! Why do you intrude? There is food on the gas stove. Should I turn down the heat? Keep walking! Fuck the lights in your apartment. Why did they install a three second photocell? What are you telling me? You should have thought about it before you killed Faruk. First, you kill the building manager, then you complain about a photocell. -Was he the building manager? -Of course. Oh no! Ilhami. Yes? Oktay was talking about a problem. Did you know anything about it? They couldn’t withdraw the money. Are you talking about that? How come they couldn’t withdraw it? The vault could only be unlocked by Oktay’s voice. Their password was late Merve’s name. -The password was her last name pronounced as a first name. -So? -It needs to be repeated for three times. -Yes. They couldn’t get their tongue around it. Screw them! I am sorry. Don’t mention it. What was that? Ilhami, let’s take a look at them. Don’t throw anyone down. Dad? What happened? Why did you come? What is happening there, Oktay? There has been an incident. It has gone overboard. They are everywhere. On our way to Zafer’s house, we could zap as many as we can. Are you coming? Come on in. I feel so sorry for you. I feel so sorry for you. Really. Poor you. Poor you. You are so young and beautiful. Look at your face. Too bad. You are carrying a baby. What did that baby do wrong? What did that baby do wrong? They put you here. What are you, a trash can? You a human being. You don’t even have a wedding gown. You don’t even have a wedding gown. A woman wants her man to take his parents... ...and ask for her hand in marriage from her family. What is it that you are having? A secret love affair? How long is this going to last for? Serhan is a good kid. That’s for sure. If he is that good, he should get a mosque built. Whatever. Let’s not spoil our fun. Kick start yourself. Get it together. Don’t worry. Let me take a look at them. Atakan, give me my bag. Quickly. Turn it off. I beg you. Sure thing. Let me take a look at them. Get changed. Bring the car. -From where? -What do you mean from where? From wherever you put it. The car was here. Why did you come after us? I couldn’t wait so I came. What do you mean you couldn’t wait? Why did you leave her here? Where is the car? -It is gone. -What do you mean it is gone? They took the girl. How come? Get changed. Okay, dad. How are we going to get changed? Guys, didn’t you hear my father? What are we waiting for? What the hell? Only Oktay’s clothes can fit me. I won’t wear Sevil’s clothes. Atakan should wear them. Why would I wear your clothes? Everyone should know their place. Should we wear each other’s clothes? What should we do? Serhan. What are you doing? What have you done! Put something on. -Do you know Begum’s number by heart? -I do. What... ...are you doing? When Oktay took it off... Come on! -Hello. -Hello. -What happened, Zafer? -We fell down. -How did you fall down? -We fell down pretty badly. -Where is the phone? -It is there. -Let me give you a wet towel. -Give it. Do you have another? Hello, Begum? What have you done, Begum? You fucked us in the ass. I beg you. Come back. Where are you now? What? She left with the car. She wants me to... ...ask her parents for her hand in marriage. We are struggling for our lives here. This is all we needed! Is this the right thing to do under these circumstances? She said we waited for your idiot brother to take a dump... ...we might as well wait for this. How? She said we waited for your idiot brother to take a dump... ...we might as well wait for this. Shut up! She says her parents need to be respected. She says she has been carried around like a trash can. She is right. How are we going to get changed, Begum? We are at a kiosk right now! She says she will burn the passports. Tell her not to burn the passports. Give it to me. Why are you threatening us? It is very unlikely of you. It is unbelievable. She says we assed her out in the van. She says, “What kind of people are you... ...to ass me out like that?” She says, “Damn you!”. Yes. She says Sevil told her all the right things when they were in the van. She says, “It will go down like this... ...otherwise I will make sure you can’t get away.” Something like that. What did you tell her? I gave her a piece of sisterly advice. We had a chat. Just the two of us. Why do you get involved in this? We had a woman to woman conversation. What is wrong with that? Do you know what I have been going through? I have ten men in my life! Can I embrace my womanhood? Be patient for a day. Then you can embrace your womanhood! I have to give the phone to her. It is unbelievable. I am so pissed off. Let’s calm down. Calm down. Serhas has started attacking me. Did I say that? Would I say anything like that? She says she will burn the van. Tell her not to burn the van. No. -When you call me an idiot... -Zafer! Zafer! Hang up the phone! Dust yourself off! Come on! Welcome. Come on in. -Hello. -Thank you. We are sorry. This was a very last minute thing. That’s right. We couldn’t prepare anything. -Don’t worry. -Don’t even mention it. Go ahead, please. We are sorry. These things can’t be rushed. But this is urgent because-- How are you? Thank you. We are fine. Take this slipper. You have the other pair. Why don’t you go first and show them the way? What are you doing? Get me out of here. Leave them at the coat stand. Nobody move! Sevil, hand out the slippers. Don’t move. Don’t move. One by one. -Dad, I have two slippers for left foot. -Shut up, don’t talk. Please. Come on in. Come here. One by one. Not like that, son. I lost my sweater in that turmoil. I could put on only one pair of slippers in that chaos. Can you look for the other pair? Please. Finally! What was that back there? Don’t bring it up. We are cautiously dressed. Actually, the weather has been very good nowadays. Why did you get dressed like this? There is this saying,... ...“think of winter... ...you’ll be lucky to end up with summer.” That’s the drill. How are you? Are you fine? Thank you. We are working hard for our children’s wellbeing. That’s wonderful. Are you... ...Serdar’s brothers? No. Serdar was our high school friend. She meant to ask about Serhan. We are his brothers. You have a beautiful house. I loved it. It is such a warm house. Right? It is a chic, cosy house. -Yes, really. It is very well heated. -It is not that. We are wearing warm clothes. What is your line of work? Son, how thoughtless of you! Don’t worry. He is wondering. If I may,... ...I’d like to talk about our family. When you look at our family from different perspectives,... ...I am talking in regard to other families,... ...we are very much bound to each other... ...and with our... ...strong ties-- Zafer, why don’t you let our father talk? Of course. I hear some music. Our son loves listening to aria. We try to support him as much as we can. That’s wonderful! We are not foreign to it either. Sir,... ...the reason of our visit... ...is that... ...our children... ...got to know each other. They fell in love with each other. Everything happens too fast these days. Nothing is like the way it used to be. According to the... ...command of God... ...and word of the Prophet... ...his holiness Muhammed Mustafa... ...may peace be upon him,... ...we ask for your daughter’s hand... ...in marriage. I don’t know what to say. What is your occupation, son? -Serhan is here. -There? We own a restaurant. You must have heard it. Anatolian Flavor 1071 Anatolian Flavor 1071... We have a jingle named Anatolian Flavor 1071... ...so that it sticks in your mind. I don’t know what to say. I should ask my daughter. What do you say? Whatever you think is appropriate... My dear. Your mother and I... ...work for your happiness. If that’s the case,... ...I should congratulate you. We shall ask for permission to leave. Take your belongings Begum and we’ll get going. What is going on now? Where are you going? Begum? A chopper will pick us up at 8am. It will pick us up and drop us at a cargo steamer. Then we will go to port of Odessa. The rest is unknown. We haven’t made a plan yet. But we have 8 hours in total. We need to get out of here as soon as possible. -Ilhami, -Yes? Shall we sit? Sure. I didn’t get anything. What chopper? What is going on, Begum? What is this? Say something. Can you tell me? If you think... ...I am good for nothing-- Not at all. You didn’t have to go through this much trouble for that. You could have talked to me, right? If you realized your mistake... ...and were doing all that you can... ...just to stall us... ...then I would tell you that... ...I am not... ...approving this marriage. -Am I not right? -You are right. Let me give you a fatherly advice. What was bought in a hurry... ...may soon be regretted. You got it? I got it, dad. No, you didn’t. Nobody in this room did. If they had understood... ...they wouldn’t have rushed anything. It is perfectly clear. If you buy something in a hurry... ...you will think about it... ...and regret it soon. Being in a hurry causes regret. Something like that. I don’t approve this marriage. That’s it. If you say, “I will ignore my father and do as I please”... ...then it is up to you. That’s it. Why are you talking like that? Why don’t we,... ...as father to father, talk somewhere in private? I will explain you everything. Please do so. Please. -He is talking about a chopper. -Yes. He says he has got no time. How did you convince him? Mr. Alper must be getting tensed in the crowd. Obviously, he is reasonable in one on one discussion. Exactly. Didn’t he have such a plastic and artificial rage... ...when confronting his daughter? -What are you saying? -Nothing. Guys,... ...empty the trunk. Serhan... ...do you need something from the van? No. Come, we’ll have dinner. -Come. -Okay. I am coming. Since we couldn’t withdraw the money, what are we going to do? What are we going to eat and drink in Ukraine? Don’t worry Oktay. We’ll handle that. We can make a living with our profession. -We’ll be fine. -Of course,... ...there are so many men around the world that have to be shot. We’ll start up our own organization. Uncle Gazanfer will run it. We’ll live like kings. Is that what I am talking about, Atakan? This family has been managing a restaurant for 40 years. Wherever we are going, we’ll open a nice restaurant there. We shouldn’t open a local restaurant. I am sick of it. No. We’ll open a seafood restaurant. Seafood restaurants are profitable. Fish, octopus... It is good to take care of tourists. Seafood is good. Okay. If it comes down to it, I will fish. I will dive and take care of it. In short, I would like to... ...apologize to you... ...on behalf of our family. We could have got to know you earlier. I get it. I mean... ...I don’t get everything but... What is that? Let me wash my face! He got all emotional. Yes, dad? Get in here! -What? -Get in here, be quick! You are never getting out of here, Begum. -No! -You are not getting out of here! -No! -I will be back. -Don’t leave me. -I will be back. I promise. I love you so much. Don’t leave me! What happened? Why did they stop? A high calibre machine gun like M60 heats up quickly... ...because it has excessive rates of fire. That’s why one needs to wait in such circumstances. For example,... ...we have the same one. If Atakan had brought it,... ...I would have demonstrated you here. They will start firing soon. We are getting hit badly. -Serbest. -Yes? Are you alright? I am craving for bread. Zafer? I am fine. I just have a scratch. Serhan? Are you alright? I’ve been shot. I have to say something. I am sorry to be saying this. Now that you brought up M60,... ...I asked in the beginning... ...whether I should take it or not? I was asked if M60 was light enough. On top of that, I asked if we needed anything... ...from the van when I was getting out. Serhan said, “No. Come and let’s have dinner.” What are you saying? You are so careless. Does someone have to say something all the time? You have to take care of things by yourself. Oh, my dear. Oktay. We are dying. Let’s die. Are we dying? I’ve never made love. Dad. Dad. My dear,... ...you talked too much. We thought you had passed away. What is the situation? What have you done? We thought about dying but... ..if you have another plan... We thought there was no point of living... ...if you weren’t alive. I can’t die. Thanks to you, Serbest. What kind of a trouble is this? Sevil. Where are you Sevil? I am fine. I am fine. What did you do with the girl, Serhan? I put her in the fridge. In the fridge? Do you have a plan? What should we do now? Ilhami,... ...give everyone the breadsticks. That’s nice. It will absorb the pepsin. What pepsin? These breadsticks... ...have skewers on the inside. Listen up. There are five or six people outside. Since they stopped firing, they will try to get inside. Once the infiltration starts,... ...don’t move. Wait for me. When I start shooting,... ...stab everyone... ...with your breadsticks. Take over the gun of a man you hunt down. -Serhan. -Yes, dad? -Zafer? -Dad? You will jump out of the window. You take care of the ones outside, we’ll take care of the ones inside. -Okay? -Of course. -Dad. -Yes? There is no skewer in my breadstick. I bit it. There is nothing in it. Give him the new one, Ilhami. Okay. Let’s get this done without any casualties. Are we good to go? Come on. One final battle. I can’t stand this. You couldn’t put this arm back on. Try again. Be grateful that we are alive. How are you? Don’t touch him. Dad, where are we going? I don’t know. Atakan, open the window.
