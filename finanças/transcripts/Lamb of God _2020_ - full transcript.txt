Subtitle by Manvagtoo Then God said to him: Takethy only begotten son Isaac, whom thou lovest, and go into the land of vision. And there thou shalt offer him for a holocaust, upon one of the mountains which I will show thee. Freely inspired by historical persons and events. He's coming! Lord, we give you thanks for this food. For our bread and our water. And we pray for those children without food. That they should have bread. And let us hunger and thirst for Justice, to those who do have bread. Goal! - What are you doing, asshole! - Go back to the jungle, animal! - Are you sure you heard a noise? - Of course, my fair lady librarian. Before Saint Jeronimo, call Susanna. - And who are you? - Susanna, that's my name. I mean, this Saint Jeronimo person... Saint Jeronimo is the patron Saint of libraries. We are here about the noises - I did hear you I said! And not that Saint Jeronimo. Oh what a fright! - Do like you're frightened... - But I am for real! So, we'll hide then. - Oh, I'm frightened! - Mother! They're ghosts! Don't they feel embarrassed? Fine. Let's go to sleep then. To sleep. Joaquin. Sorry. I didn't mean to hit you. You're an idiot. Let me sleep. I know. You forgive me? I want to sleep. Kids, it's me! It's me! Can't you see? It was a joke! Father Agustin died just there, between those beds! Don't you recall?! They're dead with fright, those kids. You need an exorcism, Brother Francisco! That was the work of the Devil! Nothing is like it used to be. Yes, Father Gregorio. Things change, these are different times. Different times... And I believe Brother Francisco had good intentions. Intentions... I just don't understand. They are many less boys than before, but it's so much harder to manage them. The problem is Franz, and his bouts of violence. He finds it very hard to express his emotions. The kind of 'emotion' the boy had with Brother Lucio, before he was kicked out? Our 'emotive' brothers... Father, we need flour. We could ask the archbishop to help out, no? If they haven't already thrown us out. It's because we have nowhere else to go. Don't give them reasons to close this place down. They could so easily convert this into a hotel. We'll keep asking for donations from the village I'll go there tomorrow. Then Jana came, and one of the brothers... with some men from Judea. An they asked about the jews who had fled. That had escaped captivity in Jerusalem. Boys, why was he still in Jerusalem? What's that noise?! Silence, I said! Why was he still in Nazareth? In Jerusalem, Father Gregorio. Silence, I said! Idiot. Franz, one of the mares has escaped. He's still stealing the blood of Christ. - Hello. - Are you a new teacher? From where are you from? Do you have some chocolate? I'm father Martin. - Are the Brothers here? - They're just coming. They could have warned us, we would have prepared a room. Don't worry. How would they, if even the postman no longer comes here? True, the path is very long. How do you manage day to day... , so far away? And with this heat? In any case, don't worry. I'm here for a very short time. Just that your superiors asked me to observe a little... Where things may improve, things you may need. The state of things here, generally speaking. You are not from here, are you? Where are you from? I detect a ...Dutch accent. No, in any case, from far away, and I'm presently traveling through your country. A very beautiful country indeed. I'm from Rio de la Plata, I don't know if you know the region? It's beautiful. Serve a mate to Father Martin, please. No, I don't know that region. In any case, as I said, I'm traveling... and everything I've seen so far pleases me a lot. Your people are very agreeable, open and candide. - Mate? - Sure, thank you. In my own country, people don't... They don't... Speak much to each other. They distrust each other, going so far as to distrust priests, can you imagine that? So, I'm very pleased to be here. - Which country are you from, Father? - Oh, I nearly forgot! Oh no, we never indulge in that here! Well, Brother, only for special occasions. And I think we have one here. Recently arrived... It would be an honour for us. - You brought it from Europe? - Yes, from Scotland. How far! Exactly, and it's been 30 years now... That I live here, taking care of these destitute children... Father Gregorio, it's the children who look after you! What did you say? There were more than 200 boys. And we were 20 priests living together in the faith in God. But now... Everything has gone to hell! It could become what it was again. The trouble here is that the children do nothing other than sin. And even our own Brother's... If you only knew... Father, enough Scottish nectar for you today. We have early morning classes to prepare for. In any case, here... It seems like, like, there is tremendous diversity among the boys. - Many different types, and origins... - Indeed. Some are from here, some from over there... But their parents, not a good one among them. Yes, if they all abandoned them here. Imagine that. But we are like brothers to them, like fathers. Like their mothers. Argentina, with all its beauty and its diversity... Open wide its doors after the war, the terrible war... They came from everywhere did they not? Yes, the war, still has its victims. After so long. - Those children... - Yes... for sure. - But we here, we don't question anyone anything... - Luckily they have us. They are like... Little lambs. In our own barn. From whatever background they come, we accept them. I cry so much for them. Why don't you pray for them, rather than cry like a little girl?! I'd better go. Come now, everyone in bed! Everyone in the OWN bed. Come here Brother Francisco! Boys... Boys, I pray so much for you. Oh, he smells of alcohol! He smells like a drunk. We don't even have a lawn mower, but the horses help us with the grass... The wood saw... we've been waiting years for a spare part. We've had many storms, and ruined the buildings. This used to be our main entrance, shameful now. We can't even walk here. This was going to be a guest room. But the works never finished. It's been broken for a while, so the boys bathe in cold water. That's Franz. A difficult one. Not so difficult, more of a loner. In his own world. - Franz? - Yes, he only has his mother left. Though it's been 3 years she hasn't visited. He's had a difficult background. I even feel that he doesn't much like his mother. Despite our efforts, he just doesn't fit into this place. And... Where are his parents from? No, we don't know. Actually we prefer not to ask. They are all the same to us, we think it's better that way. How to see our school, the children, the space? How is discipline, with the boys here? No, yes, very good discipline here. Both of us, together with the Fathers work daily on matters of their discipline. The usual things. Some naughtiness... Good, good. You have just one week to hand in the work. And you know, if you don't, you'll be staying with Father Gregorio, whilst we go on our camping trip. We'll go just after Christmas. So if you have any problems, with your shoes, for example, you have none, tell me now, ok? Better than than running around later. Talking of Christmas, boys: Please, this year we have a guest. I ask the best of you. That everything be clean, and nice. New flowers, clean clothes. Axel, could do one of your flower arragments? And Roman, in the outdoor toilets find a way to close them to avoid that nauseous smell... Lets see if this year, we do everything properly... Brother, Joel told me that my mum sleeps with the village priest because she's a whore. Why do you listen to this stupidities? When you know you have no mum. Let's go. Enough! Ok, that's enough! Silence! Brother Julio, has something important to say. I know you're all excited about Christmas and the camp but please, if you keep this up, we're going nowhere this year. No Christmas, no nothing. And remember the homework. - Go now. - Can we go to Bariloche to camp? - Who'll pay? - Me! - Where are we going? - A very nice place, that I know. - Are there girls there? - In the middle of the mountains. One of the highest peaks around. There's a river, fields... It's a bullshit place! You don't know the place! And you speak like that again... I'll wash your mouth with soap! Put your soap in your ass! No! ...Then after he'll put it in your mouth! Should I go to camp with these? If you like, you could teach them classes. It would be great for them. Thank you, good idea. I was looking... the students evaluations. They're somewhat behind in their studies it seems. It would be important that you give us your own feedback, Father Martin. Observe, by all means. I appreciate it. Tomorrow, we'll talk about this then. Very good. (speaks German) Look. Look at all this Julio. Sometimes I fee like crying seeing God's creation. Let's go to the river? Let's. What's that?! It's... The Virgin. Can't be. The Virgin was blond. Who are you? What are you doing here? Who are you? I'm Jesus' daughter. His daughter? Didn't she mean his mother? - Oh, Jesus! - What? Jesus is our new groundkeeper. The new groundskeeper is called Jesus? What the hell?! - Forgive me, is your father Jesus? - Well, yes. - And the son. - Don't joke about such things Julio! Look, we can't be having her here, you know how the boys are... Boys! What's going on here? Did you invite Jesus here? What a question... I mean... Jesus, the groundskeeper. Oh yes, we couldn't be without one much longer. Somehow we'll pay him, with food. Father but did you know he had a daughter... like this... Yes. Boys, keep away from the windows. Father, you know the boys, in their state, at their age... can you imagine the multiplication of virgins... I mean... We simply cannot have this in our school. The boy will become hysterical! Hysterical yourself, Brother Francisco! Fran, calm down. I know how to solve this, come. You know how we thought it was the virgin apparition at first? - Yes. - Well, we tell the boys, that, in a certain way she IS the Virgin, something divine. - The Virgin Of The River. - And Jesus' daughter. They'll understand nothing, but better that way. We tell them she is the Virgin, and we'll dress her as such. My idea is that we use her as a live Nativity play. If we tell them that, they won't even dare to have dark thoughts. I like it! Yes! And we'll bring a lamb. And a baby. Do we have one? Yes, it's a good idea, a live nativity. But, until then? The children... The Groundkeepers house is far away. We'll impose strict orders that no one is to approach that house. Could I make the dress? Why don't you play with the other boys? I play with them. Not much from what I see. Some of them are bad. They all seem nice enough to me. Sing. Sing. You have a nice voice, sing. And you, you're not bad? No. How would you know that? One knows these things. I wouldn't be so sure. Franz, do you feel different than the others? That's what I thought. You have no one for you outside, true? They abandoned you like a dog. This, I understand. In any case, I can help you. Yes? Father Martin, a question please... Come in. How are you? We wanted to know... if it wasn't a bother... If... we could I mean if it wasn't a problem... Tomorrow for us... It would be an honour, if... We would love it, if you'd preach the sermon at our Christmas mass tomorrow. A sermon? I'm grateful, but the truth is... It'd be better if you ran your usual routine. You're wounded? No, ...but really, continue with your custom I'm only here for a short time. Father, it would be such an honour, besides, the boys would love to listen to a different voice. And God forgive me, but you'd be saving us from an endless diatribe by Father Gregorio. I feel very rusty, it's been very long since... Something short. In fact, the shorter the better. Thank you Father, from the heart, I thank you. Well, from both our hearts! Reading from the Gospel according to Saint Luke. The birth of Jesus. The birth of Jesus was like this. Recently married Mary with Joseph. Before they lived together. It was found she had conceived by way of the Holy Spirit. Her husband Joseph being a just man... (garbled prayer) God! 'Lamb of God, Lamb of God'... who takes away the sins of the world... Father Martin. Father Martin. How to show your faith before God? How to know what is good, and what is evil, when men so often contradict each other. Well, one must listen to our inner self. That is where God speaks. There once was a Prince named Peter. He deeply loved a woman named Isabel. But his father, the King, told him he could not marry her, because she was of another faith. But the prince would not give in, he said 'This woman is the love of my life' She is the only woman for me in this life. And he refused to marry any other. So, his father took some men and one night, entered the lady's room and murdered her. Later, when Peter inherited the throne, at the death of his father. The first thing he did, was to call those men involved in the death of his loved one. And, facing them, one next to the other, and he himself slit open their chests and with his own hands, ripped out each of their hearts. And said, with his bleeding hand: 'This is what you did with my own heart!' So, if someone hits you, should you offer the other cheek? Well, no. Because they will hit you again. Think on that. We all have a role in the Justice of this life. If someone strikes you, then hit him harder twice, three times... Rip his heart out of necessary! Because weakness in also a sin in God's eyes. And God will understand. And only then can peace prevail! This year, boys, to enter better in the true spirit of Christmas. We prepared a recreation of the live nativity so that you can appreciate and see close up, how was the birth of our Lord Jesus Christ. And this Saint, the Virgin Mary Saint among saints and pure of all sin, after giving birth to Jesus Received the visit of three wise men. She was saintly and so pure... Reading from the Gospel on the birth of Jesus. The birth went thus: Recently married Mary with Joseph, Before they lived together it was found she had conceived by means of the Holy Spirit. Her husband Joseph, being just did not want to slander her and thought of repudiating her secretly. Lamb of God, that takes away the sins of the world give us peace. Amen. Also, we're not treating him so well... - He's a guest like any other, please. - It's the image we give to Europe. Oh my God, Europe... Europe... I was thinking, maybe we could ask him to give classes. Indeed. Group classes, not individual ones. He could help us a great deal. We need a great deal. As you wish. What are you doing?! Boys, please! What are you doing? You come here. Thomas, what are you doing? How many times I told you to use the toilet! You're leaving? Yes. Every year we go camping. After Christmas, so the boys breath a little otherwise they're locked here all year round, poor kids. I could accompany you. It's pretty far away, and... the conditions are truly not very good... Lack of toilets, smell of growing boys... No problem. I'm used to it. As a boy I used to camp a lot. You're taking Father Martin with you? He asked. Of course he did. Don't naive please. Hey, Virgin. Virgin, Virgin Mary. Virgin, we need to leave, but wait for us. She's not there. Yes, sure she's there. I know about these things. Hey Virgin! 'Lamb of God, that takes away the sins of the world' I'm hot. Of course, it's summer. I'm hot, I'm hot... I'm thirsty. We're almost there, don't complain. We're here to have fun. Stakes, give me stakes! Come over here and help. We all need to sleep in tents or you want to sleep outside? What are you doing? We need to sleep in these after. Boys! Don't start with the usual... We're leaving, we're going back. Enough of this! Put everything back together and we're going back to school... For God's sake! Stop with those obscene gestures! Away, away! Go play! We'll do it alone. My dick! Stop pushing each other. Can I sleep outside at night? Each one at his place, go! - I'll help you. - I want none of your help. Go play. My dick is really very big! - What? - Father Martin... He shouldn't get to know... What do you think, Father Martin? You like this place? Very beautiful. It reminds me of my childhood. God has offered us a wonderful landscape. They say this is the highest peak in the region. - That one? - That one. They say it reaches 1600 meters. I'll go up and see it. - Now? - Tomorrow. - Climb it? - Of course. No, it would take hours. It's very steep. I would never dare, with all those insects. A snake could show up. Anything really. A puma. A bear. A giraffe - A weasel. - Rats. - A hummingbird. Bees. Hey guys, let's go to the river. Let's go! Father Martin! Come with us! Father Martin! Oh my Virgin Mary... Amen. Virgin Mary, so pure of sin. Saint among saints. Amen. Amen. How wonderful, they feel in communion with their creator. Yes, maybe. This is a psilocybe semilanceata. What? Psilocybe semilanceata psilocybe your ass. It has special properties. Hallucinogenic. Halluci-what? It affects your brain, and makes you travel. To places where you're not. Well, that's what the books say. And where do they go? I don't know. In the sky I think. - The shamans used them. - And it's poisonous? Well, no, otherwise they wouldn't take them, stupid. Ah, ok, See later then! No! The Brothers will kill you! Got one! - Nice? - Yes. Xoan? Joel? Are you O.K? Benicio, what's their game? They ate mushrooms. What do you mean, mushrooms? Well... Mushrooms. Joel ate a mushroom? No. What do you mean, no? He ate lots of mushrooms. The others as well. They also, they all ate them? That's it. They'll cancel our outings. What outings, they're going to sack us for this! - They ate these? - Yes. - Why? - To travel to other places... - Who travels to other places with these? - The shamans. Shamans? Germán? Román? You ate these mushrooms? Everything is God's. What? He wanted this. That children should drug themselves? Virgin Mary. It's these. Look. They seem at peace. When's the last time we saw them like this? Who created this, if not the Almighty? We try them? Only a little. And? They taste of ...mushroom. I feel nothing. You think they are pretending? How beautiful, Julio. They're so beautiful. What? The cows. Super beautiful. - Doesn't it make you feel sad? - Why? Look. They were free, and happy. Then, they killed them to fill our stomachs. Sorry. Sorry. We're sorry! We are cows also. You are beautiful! Don't leave! I saw nothing. Or very little... Thank you. Franz. Come. Come. Franz, I need to speak to you. You know you are... - special, right? - Yes. How are you special? I'm handsome. Franz! I don't know what they told you... Sit down now. Franz, you are special in another sense. Due to you family. Because of your father. Don't worry. Trust in me. It's your dad that taught you that song You sang the other day in church right? You know how I know? Because he taught to me as well. I don't get it. Franz, your dad, is my dad also. I am Martin Bormann, same as dad. My dad is Martin, like you, but Keller. Yes, Keller. Your dad was called Bormann in his own country. In Germany. We he came here he changed name because many people... did not like want he did during the war. But I don't get it. - We're brothers. - Brothers? But how is that possible? Of course, I'm old. My father had me when he was 25, in Berlin. Much later, when he was 50, he had you. With another woman, here in Argentina. But, how did you know it was me, or where I was. It's been two years I've been searching for you. You, and other family members. Look, ...the war ruined everything. The war was terrible. Dad also didn't help matters. He ruined many things. But now I want to reunite the family again. Save what's left. That's why I'm here. - You know where dad is? - I don't know. I searched for him. I think he left for Paraguay. He got scared. As I said, many people did not like him much. I don't know if dad is alive or not, but I know you are. And now I have to tell you something... You have a family in Germany, a big family, brothers... Sisters, aunts and uncles, even Grand parents. Your family is big, with lots of land. They're waiting for you. You place is not here, you belong there and want ot bring you back. But one thing: This is OUR secret. You can't tell anyone, especially not the Brothers. It would take years for the paperwork so that I could do this. I need to do this my way, you understand? Do not tell anything to anyone. Very good boys, thanks so much for your help! You're welcome. They never do anything. And why do we have to leave? Let's stay here. Yes. What do mean stay here? I'm glad you liked it but it's over, we had our days... Carefully, so they don't fall... As usual, Alejo... When do we leave? Patience, Franz. There's much to do still. - Like what? - Like what? Your mother. - You forgot about her? - She the one who forgot about me. Maybe she had her reasons. - What's her name? - Greta. - Greta. German as well? - I think so. Where does she live now? - I don't know. - Well, where did you live before? I'm here since I was seven years old. It was a village with an old church. - Built by Jesuits. - Ah, in ruins? Yes, ...San Ignacio? Yes, pretty sure it was that. I think I should go see her. I'll go tomorrow. You're leaving? Tomorrow? Well yes, come on now. - Don't leave! - Just a few days. Stay here. Franz, come here a moment. Please. At last! Boys, where were you? There was no one here. Only this gloomy person here. Amen, Father Gregorio. You would know. Amen. Amen! Suck it in, suck! Father Gregorio, do you know where Father Martin is? No. And put a shirt on! So, we learned that Noah had a calling from God. Who told him he had to build an Ark. He built his Ark, 80 feet long. And the animals, are you listening? The animals entered the Ark. Then came a flood that lasted 40 days and 40 nights. In the whole world. It' a very interesting story. Benicio why are you scratching your head like that? What's up that you're scratching like that? Let's see... Lice, alert, there are lice! Yes, they're lice! Over to wash all this away! Clothes off! Kids, please, what are you doing? You should be washing your hair! There are many insects! Thanks for the shaver, Brother I was looking for it everywhere... Joaquin, shy are you up? It's very late. Joaquin, why are you here? Can't knock before?! Can I stay here the night please? No sorry, tonight now. You need to overcome your fear of storms. Please. - And you're not so little anymore. - I'm frightened. Thank you Lord! Joaquin, come on. You need to dominate your fears. - You're not six anymore. - Not my fault... Nice and warm here! - Can I have chocolate? - What chocolate? Last time you gave me some. Ah, now I understand. There's no chocolate. But now I understand your 'fears'. How you manage to control your tears so easily. - I'm sooo afraid... - Yes of course, get to sleep! Chocolate. Sleep now. You're like my dad. And how was your dad? He was bad. He would hit me. When did you see him last? Last year. How would you like your family to be? Just that it be a good family. I can be your family. I can be your dad. Joaquin! Get to sleep. And hold your nose when you sneeze! What are you doing, Joaquin? Doing like Brother Julio does. What?! What do you mean? What are you saying? - Get to your own bed right now! - No. No please! Go to your bed now! Off now, go! Sleep there! Little sinner! Sinner yourself! I don't know, I think he's behaving strangely. He's not even caring for the horses anymore. Odd. Preoccupied. No motivation. Yes, he's behaving oddly. I notices a change since we got back from camping. Something happened there? Now you mention it, I've noted a change since the arrival of Father Martin. We could have it on Tuesday. Well, we agree Franz was already a special child. With a very special sensitivity. Yes, sensitivity, sensitivity! They're all poor little things. Little angels. Who knows, maybe the little blond likes it, who knows? And you two, your 'sensitivities'? It's a zoo here! Excuse me, boys... Please leave us. Go now, to the river. Have you seen Román and Joel? No. Well, actually, I last saw them in their room. - We're left without a groundskeeper again. - What happened? It seems they didn't respect the Virgin. I told you! If we bring the devil here, that's what happens! There isn't anything to stop these boys' ardors?! - I don't remember being like that. - Me neither. - I'll go speak to them. - No, better you not. Father Martin! Good day Father Martin. Franz, go back to your quarters please. Franz, your quarters, please. - How was your trip? - All good. With the Brothers, we'd like to speak to you, Father. Will you follow me, please? Father. Sorry, Father. We felt so bad. You left so suddenly, and we didn't know what to think. All of this... moves us so much. What? Why did you not tell us Franz was your brother? Yes, I see. Brothers, this is incredible! Well, yes, it's true. He never stopped crying, poor kid. He was so frightened to lose you. The rest of his family all abandoned him. I don't understand why you lied to us about this. It's just that this issue is a very delicate one. Because of his father. For mine. We understand he never had the best references as a father. Which is why they brought him to our home. To be clear: I'm not at all in agreement with what my father did in the war. Not at all. It was something horrendous. But he was my father, and he raised me well. I have no idea what took him. And now, you're trying to reunite the family. A family destroyed by the war. It's truly inspirational. - Here, almost no one has a family. - Not even us. Now we understand your interest in Franz. We'd like to apologize profusely to not have fully trusted. I can't hide the pain it will cause me to see him leave... - He was here many years. - It's better for him. I know. Brothers, it is now more important than ever that he has a place to live. Why? What I bring is very bad news. Oh no. Perhaps you may know, I don't know if he also told you this... But I didn't leave recently to speak to your superiors. But to find his mother who should have come with us. After much searching, I finally found the house. But no one lived there. And some neighbours told me she had died in an accident recently. But how, what happened? They said she died drowning. - How is that even possible. - And you are sure it was her? Yes, Greta Keller. It's the surname they gave my father on arrival here. Yes, Keller. The news will crush him. The boy is strong, besides he had not seen her in years. You came just at the right time. Like a divine intervention. It's not a coincidence. Well, Brothers, I have no choice but to speak to him now. Remember it was part of my family as well. Don't be stupid! I'm sorry for your mother, but you're not the only one who lost a mother. And stand up straight, stop crying. I'm sorry. Wake up. Wake up, we're leaving. - Where? - Come on, quickly. - Now? - Yes, now. What do I take with me? Nothing. You have plenty where we're going. I didn't say goodbye to them... A clean break is best. I need to tie the horses. It's so sudden. Where did he go? We had been talking of... photosynthesis, remember? For a biologist, and even for a simple amateur. Parasitism exists in all imaginable forms. So much so, it would be impossible to name them in all the... parts of a plant. How to does it take to get to your country? We need to take a boat, right? Father, get the children away please. Boys, stay away. Go, I said! Can you tell me if you keep a Mr. Weinstein here? - No, it's only us here. - Are you sure? It's just been us for years. We have information from the village that he's been with you for days. No, but that's Father Martin. And, where would Father Martin be now? He left this morning, not long ago. - He left? - Yes, with his half-brother, Franz. - Franz? - Franz, he's one of interns. He took him to join his family. You're worrying me. Something happened? I'm here to talk with him about the death of Greta Keller. Greta Keller, Franz's mother. We recently learned of the tragedy of her drowning. Sure, drowning. She was found in water, but her throat cut from side to side. But... I don't get it. What's this to do with us, and Father Martin? We're looking for Weinstein regarding her death. But, do I need to draw it for you? Where is Weinstein now? - I told you we know of no Weinstein! - For God's sake... I'm telling you he isn't a Priest, his name is Weinstein. David Weinstein. He's a dual national, German-Israeli. He arrived in Argentina two years ago. Isn't this the way to the camp? Why are we going there? - They're picking us up there. - By car? Yes, yes. - Where are they now? - Well... they're going to Berlin. To join their family. Why is it so important where they are? Oh Christ. Are you dumb as well as queer? This is Weinstein. It's not a priest. It's Weinstein. And we believe he killed the boy's mother, Greta Keller. The boy he just took away. And if the jew took him away it's not give him a life of luxury in Europe. A jew? Did he leave anything behind at all? - No, he took all his things. - He took all and you left him leave? But who the hell do you think you are? They're not even your own children! - Are you going to tell me where the hell he is? - Abraham! And where's he going?! Hey! Where're we going now? - We're climbing to the top. - Now? But we're far from the road. I want to offer one last prayer to God for having found you. Ah, thank you. But now, here you will pray? God asked it of Abraham and also asked it of me. And why did he ask you that? To show his faith and his strength. What are you doing Father? Where are you going? Let us deal with this. Go back to your school. Franz, sit over there. Franz. Franz Bormann. Bormann? I'm Franz Keller. We all have a role in the justice of this life. I already know that. Your mother also, and your father. Keller, Bormann, it's all the same. In any case Franz, the journey stops here. How? If someone hits you hit him back harder! Rip his heart out if needed! We're going no further. But why? Martin Bormann, Bormann, your father... Put an end to the lives of 12 of my family members. Brothers, mother... He ordered that. When are we going back down? You know how? With shovels. In the street, in front of others to show them how one does with jews. Why are you telling me this? Why are we not going to Germany? Franz, did you hear what I just said?! Your family was so special that they murdered my entire family. One at a time, and your father watching from above. They had been friends. It was all lies, ...that I had a family? I have no family? Not you or I have a family. But this doesn't matter. Because I'm here to do my duty. What God asked of me. And do what my family could not do. Is he dead? Bleeding like that, I doubt it. Do you think you're Abraham, doing this? And you, you think you're God to try and stop me? After losing all of mine, and I mean ALL of them... I've been thinking of this moment. And it's not you who will stop me. So, get lost now! They his father's crimes, not his. They were my families crimes? My mother's? My little sister's? It was their fault? He has more right to live? I'm sorry. Truly. Sure you are. All my life in this search. All of my life. Search for his father, which I had to abandon, since I suppose he died somewhere. Like a pig that he is. And if he's not dead, let him see what I will do to every member of his family. How can the boy be responsible for his father's crimes? And when they operate on a cancer, what do you think they do? They leave little bits inside? No, they rip it all out. It's his blood, his offspring, do you not get it? His father was a cancer, he's a metastasis. Your neither a doctor, or a prophet or a judge, this is NOT Justice! Justice? When our people, converted into slaves, marching towards the abattoirs... Where were you then? Filling your stomachs with pig, and wine. Talk to me about Justice! King Solomon taught us the value of Justice... Faith in God is shown with proof, not words! You know nothing of suffering! But I can guarantee you, that what you are about to do is a serious mistake for everyone. And we share the same commandment, and the most important of all. 'Though shall not kill' Which makes us the same. Sure. Like water and oil. And this? That's nothing. We planned to kill 6 million Germans by poisoning their water supply. The plan failed. But that would have been real Justice! Forgive him then. Forgive... Forgive... But what is forgiving? Other than the pathetic action of the feeble? A sad consolation for those who have nothing left. But I DO having something left. The boy is innocent! Of course, innocent! He's his fathers blood! You've seen how he behaves in your school. You know that! Forgiveness is much more powerful than acting like animals. But we ARE animals! What do you think, that animals put themselves in front of their predators, to offer them forgiveness?! You're saying things you learned from books, But I lost everything. My parents, brothers, uncles, friends... They left me empty. With no reason at all to live. Nothing is left. They even took my soul away. But yes, there is one thing left. My duty. God's commandment to me. The same God you lost, your drunkard bastard! You're an embarrassment to Him. You disgraced your own Christ! Franz, this is serious... Is the jew bastard dead? All men as the same. Franz. Help me. Franz. What can you expect from a Jew? You knew this couldn't go on much longer. You had already lost control over them. They'll be better off with us now. Take it as a lesson from God.
