UNIDENTIFIED What are you doing here, Florin? Who allowed you in? Lizuca? No, Chief, but it's urgent. What's so urgent? Are the Turks coming? Take a minute, relax. Since you're here, did you hear the joke about the job interview? A guy wants to get a job as a cop. The boss tests him: what's 2+2? 4. What's the square root of 100? 10. Well done! -And who killed Abraham Lincoln? -I don't know. Fine, go home and think about it. Come back tomorrow with the answer. He goes home, his wife asks if he got the job. The guy's thrilled: Not only did I get the job, but I got assigned my first murder case. Did you hear the one about the cop who won't laugh at his boss's jokes? I won't tell it, I don't want to ruin your day. Florin, it won't kill you to laugh every once in a while. Always so damn serious. -I heard it before, chief. -You did?... -From whom? -Preda. Preda? He stole it from me! That little sneaky bastard... -What do you want? -Radu's case, Chief. -What about it? -I want it, I can solve it. -He's on vacation anyway. -So what? You think everyone's like you? People need rest. Especially policemen. -Where did he go? -Mamaia. Mamaia? What a moron. Shitty and expensive. That's what we told him, but he said he's a patriot. Idiot. He's a fool, not a patriot. We have Croatia, Bulgaria, Turkey around us... Much better, and ten times cheaper. Well, I'm going to France, the Loire valley. My wife picked it, and you can't go against the wife. Right? But I told her, if we're going on the Loire, I'll be damned if I don't bring my fishing rod. She was in shock, she actually thought I meant it. Can I have the case? Are you out of your mind? -What case? -This one, with the burned hotels. -What hotels? -The ones owned by Ilie Dumitrascu. Florin, don't you have enough cases already? -Did you close Savin? -Yes. And Global Meridian? We're waiting on the forensics, but I've done my part. Give it to me and I'll close it in a few days. I promise. So? Why would I care? Radu's been on it for a month. He didn't find anything, made no arrests... -He's treading water. -Why do you care so much about Radu? It's his case, he'll close it. That's the point... He's not gonna close it. Cut it out. Chief, listen to me for one minute, please. -That's all I ask. -Go ahead. Ilie Dumitrascu had two hotels burn down in just 5 weeks. One at the canyon, the other at the lake. It can't be a coincidence. Okay. His business has been terrible this year. He had them burned down for the insurance money. I'm sure of it. Could be. It's possible. If he did it, we'll catch him. If he didn't, it's all fine. Let Radu get to the bottom of it. There's more... I think I found out who did it. Go on. This one, Georgian Negoita. Worked security for both hotels. Radu questioned him, got nothing. According to Radu, anyway... But I did some digging and found a few things... This gypsy also works security at the lakeside gas station. Two days a week. Off the books. Both fires started outside the buildings, and both times gas was used. I bet the owner had the gypsy throw gas and set the fires at night. If we squeeze him hard, I can shake it out of him. Great. -Tell Radu when he comes back. -Radu won't do anything about it. What the hell is wrong with you?! Forget about Radu! -And what about the dead victims? -What victims? The maid and the cleaner. The burned women. This one had a boy, the other had two girls... They had children, Chief. Are we gonna fail those poor families while we let the case go cold? Are you missing a screw, or what? Who said anything about the case going cold? Put that file back and mind your damn business. Take a couple of days off, if you're done with your work... And get some sleep, you look like shit. -What if the fucker starts another fire? -Where? -Well, Dumitrascu has one more hotel. -What? What hotel? Up at Bisericani. How's he gonna do that now, with everyone watching him? What if more innocent people are killed? Who's gonna live with that? You? Radu? I'm just wondering. Give me the case, please, and if I don't crack it in two days, do what you like. But I'll crack it. Let me see that file. Come here. Florin, I told you to come here! -Here you go. -Thank you. Take it right this instant and put it back on Radu's desk. It stays there until he comes back, clear? I gave it to him, it's his. He finds something, great. He doesn't, that's that. -Chief... -Florin! Stop it! What do you think this is?! We can't swap cases anytime you want to solve something. Next thing you know, we'll be swapping underwear, eh? Get your head straight and calm down. The bank's still up your ass? Yeah, but it's nothing, Just a small thing. Florin, careful with these crooks. Nothing's too small for them. They'll suck you dry for a missing dot. The devil's not as black as he's painted, boss. Really? You saw the devil and can tell? You're a nutjob. -Goodbye, Sir. -Cheers. Hold on... Come back for a sec. Otilia, my niece, wants to start piano classes at the music school. -How old is she? -16. Isn't it a bit too late? It's never too late to take up an instrument, right? Sixteen's a bit late for music school. How about private lessons? No, school's better. There's other kids, you have fun, laugh, get into trouble... Can you talk to Stela? I'll ask her. I can't promise anything. How about you, do you play an instrument? -No. -Me neither. See? That's why we both ended up cops. We're not artistically inclined. Forget it, Chief. Goodbye, Sir. Thanks. Heads up, the chief's sore, says you blew off his joke. -What joke? -With the job interview. He wants to sue you for intellectual theft. Intellectual theft? There's nothing to steal. Lizuca... Copy this file for me, please. -All of it? -Yes, thanks. -I can't, inspector. -Why? Not unless Mr. Radu says it's ok. What did the boss say? -Come on, Lizuca. -I can't, inspector. If Radu agrees, no problem. -I'll give him a call now. -No, forget it. Don't bother him on vacation. -I'll put it back and come back later. -Fine. Inspector, one moment, I want to ask you about that money... Not now, Dragos, I have to run. I'll catch up with you later. -Doctor Ivan. -How are you, Florin? -Working. You? -Same. -All the best. -Same. Negoita Georgian. -You go by Banel? -Yes. -You smoke? -Yes. -You work at the gas station? -Yes. Then why the fuck do you smoke? Don't you know it's dangerous? Are you trying to blow everything up there? -I'm not, boss. -You're not? -Are you working there tonight? -Yes. -When? -From 9 in the evening. Good, plenty of time. We'll stay here until 9. -So, tell me everything. -Tell you what? Everything. From the beginning. -I don't know anything. -Don't give me that. You know. I don't know, boss... I was here twice before. I told them everything. I don't know a thing. But you didn't tell me. Now, it's just you and me, so let's try again. And if I ask you ten times, you're gonna answer ten times. And you'll tell me everything, or I'll fuck you ten times over. How long have you worked for the owner? -For whom? -For Ilie Dumitrascu, at the hotels. -Just over a year. -What about the gas station? -About half a year. -Working security there too? Yes. How did you get the job at the station? -Same, through Mr. Dumitrascu. -Amazing guy, this Dumitrascu! He took you under his wing. Did you work at the hotels on the nights of the fires? No. At the gas station? -No. I had the night off. -Both nights? -Yes. -So where were you? -Home, with my mom. -Why is her statement missing? -No one talked to her? -She can't talk, my poor mom. She's sick and bedridden. So she can't tell us anything... Did you know the dead women? I've seen them around. Did you know they worked the night shift? -No. -How come, if you work nights, too? Did you know they had kids? No. Take a look. Take a good look! -Can you recognize them? -No. Neither can I, Banel. No one can anymore... -Are you left handed? -Yes. -Why did you kill two innocent women? -I didn't kill anyone, boss. -Then who started the fire? -I don't know. No one. -No one? -Maybe a spark or something. What spark?! -How did Dumitrascu pay you? -Cash in hand. -Did he ever give you extra? -No. -Sure about that? -Yes. Did he ever ask you to take gas from the station? I'll ask you again, and I want you to look me in the eye. Did Ilie Dumitrascu ask you to take gas and ignite the hotels? -Come on, officer... -Just say it. Look, you're not to blame. -It's him I want, not you. -I'm gonna tell you again, officer. I'm decent, I'm not like the other guys. I look after my sick mom, I give money to my sister. Do with me what you want, we can sit here till morning, I won't know anything more. -For God's sake! -What did you say? That's all I know. If you wanna keep wasting your time... Are you threatening me? Telling me what to do? -No, officer, it's just that... -Hey! Are you threatening me? Two people are dead and you think you'll be fine, is that it? You people can do what you want while we cops are just morons, doing nothing? You guys are smart while we're a bunch of idiots? Is that what you think? -Start writing... -Write what? Everything. Sign it and put down your address. Don't worry, you'll write all week long. Until you spill your guts. And keep these women in sight, so they can watch you write. They'll jog your memory. Go on, write! What the hell are you waiting for? Can you write? No, boss. What do you mean, no? Did you go to school? No. Didn't have the time. I worked since I was little. Christ. I can't fucking believe it. Tomorrow morning I want you back here. 10 sharp, outside in the parking lot. Got it? -Not inside? -Are you deaf? In the parking lot. -Were you ever arrested? -No. If I don't see you at 10, I'm busting you, is that clear? -Your mom will be all alone. -I'll come, I swear to God. What's wrong with your mom? -I dunno. -What's her illness? She can't speak, she's can't get out of bed. Since when? A few years ago. C'mon, go home. -Take care of your mother. -I will, boss. Thank you. -Chief in? -He went home. -What's the matter, inspector? -That scumbag threatened me. He told me to stop questioning him, or else he'll show me. -Who? -The gypsy, Negoita. -Who, that little guy outside?! -Yes. So what if he's little, these people are never alone. They come in packs, they always help each other. Motherfuckers... -Where's the book for the bullets? -Over there. Serves you right... taking over Radu's case and falling in with the gypsies... Right, I'm off. Remember when Elvis cut off that guys's hand in the club? -With the samurai sword. -So what? He gave him a car and they made up. Didn't even report it. Honest to God. That's how gypsies are, they stay away from police, can't find them in court... I'm off, too. See you tomorrow, guys. -Inspector... -Not now, Dragos, tomorrow. Thanks. -Misu... -Get some rest. You're working hard. See you tomorrow. Go fuck yourself. Close already! -Is Georgian Negoita around? -Who? Banel. The night guard. -Why? -Just because. -He's not here yet. -His shift start at 9? Yes. -You know him well? -No. He doesn't come in every night. Just twice a week. Any trouble from him? Not as far as I know. 5 liters at number three. -You didn't do anything wrong? -I'm sorry? Are you aware you're not allowed to sell gas in containers? -You didn't see me out there? -No. You need Police to teach you the rules? -Did other people do that? -I don't know. -What about Banel? Did he? -I don't know. He must have, if anyone can, right? -Do you have surveillance cameras? -Yes. Give me one lighter... a pack of Kent... and three of these beers. -You carry bags? -Yes. Give me three. Can you put everything in the trunk, please? -I'd really appreciate it. -Sure. -Thanks so much. -You're welcome. -What's your name? -Simona Muntean. -Say again? -Simona Muntean. Tell your boss I stopped by and checked on you. -Ok. -Don't let that happen again. Got it? I'll come back tomorrow for the cameras. Do you have a gun? Beg you pardon? As a police officer, don't you carry a gun? -Never touched a gun before? -No. Here... Hold it tight. It's quite heavy. Are you from town? No, from Serbesti. My dad drives me every day. Ok, Simona. See you around. -Hello, Sir. -Hi, Nelu. That's poop from Olimpia's pigeons. -We should shoot them all. -Why, Nelu? They're not harming anyone. It's not their fault. Sure, but they're spraying shit all over our cars and apartment windows. So? We can clean it up, can't we? They don't know what they're doing. They don't, but Olimpia sure does. Give her a break, these pigeons are all she has left in this world. Are we picking on old neighbors now, Nelu? Have a great week. -Hello. -Hi, Mircea. Florin? I've been calling like crazy. How are you? I've had a ton of things to do. I thought I was clear! Where are you? Bucharest. What do you mean, Bucharest? -I told you last week, remember? -When? Last week. I got sent here. You were supposed to stop by the bank. Today was the last day. And how would I do that? I'm away with work. Look, here's the deal, okay... I tried to talk here, last week and again today, but I couldn't do it. You missed two payments. I tried my best. I'm sorry. They'll repossess your car. Hello? Did you hear? You have to give the car back. Yeah, I got it. No problem. Let them take it. All right. Tomorrow morning at 9. -Wait! Wait Mircea, are you there? -What? Tomorrow's not good. Tell them to come Friday. My hands are tied, Florin. Come on, reschedule for the end of the week. I can't do it. I mean it. Why not? I'll return it myself in three or four days... come on... Mircea. How long have we known each other? Look... If you stop by tomorrow, I'll try again with my boss. -But early. -I can't come early. -When, then? -In the afternoon. Around 2. -Can you come any sooner? -I'll try my best. Come on, please. Okay. 2 o'clock, don't be late. -No worries, man. I'll be there. -I vouched for you. -Ok then... Good night. -Thanks a lot. Fucking prick... Come here. Don't stand there like a wet kitten. Get in. Get in already! Don't worry, I have good news. Close the door. I got the fire report, here. Both fires were deemed accidental. Know what that means? You're in the clear. Now, the owner, he's in trouble. The safety code... But you're all good. And I've got two surprises. One... That's for you. Take it, I wasted your time. You wanna keep me hanging? And two... Banel, do you wanna work security forever? You got a PhD from the guards' school, so now it's all you wanna do in life? -No, I didn't. -I figured... -I'll find you something better. -There's no need, boss. I already asked around... I found a couple of gigs. Give me a few hours and I'll tell you for sure. I squeezed you hard, so it's fair. Thank you. And yes, you did. You have no idea what I can do, do you... Take this, too. For your mom. Take care of her. -Thank you, officer. -Don't drink it away! Are you taking care of her or... -I am, officer. -I'll check on you! Sure thing. Come anytime. Pay attention... come to my place at 4. I know you can't write. I drew the directions. Here. You know the new buildings in Darmanesti? Great. Stamatin street, fifth building. That X marks the spot. Do you know the letter X? -Yes. -Show it to me. That's it. But show up, ok? I can't waste time with you. I'll be there. Should I call you before? Are you insane? Is that what I said? Come at 4 sharp and I'll meet you in the parking lot. Yeah. Got it, boss. Thanks. Hold on! Get back. You said you work at the station from 9 o'clock. -Right. -Why weren't you there last night? We had to deal with a bear. -What bear? -We live near the woods. A bear came down and went for the chickens. The dogs jumped it, it was a huge fuss. All right, then. Go on. 4 sharp, in the parking lot. Yes, boss, thank you. Fucking glove compartment! Marius... Come here a sec, please. -Cheers. -Hey. What's up with your face? I'll tell you later... Listen, I really need your help. -I need 1,000 by tomorrow. -Don't have it. -Please. -I don't have a thousand. -Might have 500. -That'll do. I'll pay you back, end of month. -Don't forget about it, ok? -Thanks. -End of the month. -I won't forget. Put some ice on it. Hold on, stay still... No need for a doctor, but it's pretty ugly. Ok... That's it. I put pen and paper on the table. -Can I make you a coffee? -Yes. Psychopaths, that's the only logical explanation. Psychopaths, mark my words. How do you plan something like this? Thanks. Here's the chocolate. Is the boss in? Yes, but he's talking to Accounting. You can wait. Ovidiu, here's your chocolate. -Your dad will be back soon, ok? -Thank you. What happened? Some guy jumped him in the parking lot. -What?! When? -Ten minutes ago. -Where? -In the parking lot, can't you hear? Look. -Same gypsy from yesterday? -Couldn't tell. But a gypsy for sure. He came from behind, struck me and ran away. -With what? -A stone or something. -Here we go. -Unbelievable... -Are you filing a report? -Not sure. Should I? You just said so a minute ago. -You need to tell the Chief, too. -Yeah, I should... It's the last thing I needed... What do you think, Dragos? I think you should, don't underestimate these fucking crows. Fine, I'll file it. It must be the same guy. Who else? That guy or some other, same difference. They're all the same, gypsies. Fuckin' hell... -Dragos... -Yes. I know I said I'd pay you back last week, but give me a few more days. All right, inspector. -If you're strapped... -Thanks so much. Any other news? -My daughter got an F in Maths. -What for? -Got caught cheating. -Tough luck. C'mon, Ovidiu! Didn't you say you'll play something for us? It's a great thing, to play an instrument... -What do you wanna be when you grow up? -I don't know. Come on now, you must know. -A cop. -Of course! Like his old man... -How else? -Let's have a listen. -Bravo! Beautiful! -Bravo! Bravo, Ovidiu! Florin, I just wanna know if you've gone completely out of your mind... Do you think you're Robocop? -No, Chief. -Of course not. You're Robocock, that's what you are. You look like a scarecrow, you know that? I'll put you up on the roof, to stop the pigeons shit all over our building. Forget about those cases, my boy. Do you sleep ok, are you eating fine? Stop working like a madman all day long. Hell, who's looking after you? -Don't worry about me, Chief. -Really? When you've gone completely cuckoo? I don't want hurt cops in my precinct. You'll end up in the hospital one day, you know that. I told you, put the file back! I was talking into the air. Didn't I order you to put the file back? Drop everything this instant, you hear? Not just Radu's case, everything! Global Meridian, Savin, everything. Go home, get some sleep. I've got no use for overworked cops. Look at me! Are we clear? Stop all investigations, or I'll suspend you. Take the week off. Clean yourself up, shave, get your head straight. Come back on Monday, like a normal cop, not like one who wants to conquer the world. That mindset gets you nowhere. I can't stop working while you pay me, Chief. I'm not paying you. The State is paying you... Anyway. I asked Dragos to check on this. -And I called Radu back early. -From vacation? Why? To take care of these damn gypsies. From now on, we'll do it my way, not yours. Got it? Did you hear Preda's boy play the violin? Did you put in a word for my niece? For the music school. Not yet, I forgot. I'll do it. Of course you forgot, with so many cases. You can't delay these things, you know... -They take time. -I'll ask, Chief. How's Stela? She's got a concert on Sunday. Rehearsing all day long. She can't take care of you, huh? That's why you've gone batshit... Got a pair of extra tickets? -No, but I'll get them. -Never mind. When artists are involved, it's better to buy them. It's only right. -What's she playing? -Chopin. God. Again with the French... No Romanians? Enescu, Porumbescu... -He's Polish, Chief. -Who? -Chopin, he's Polish. -No way. As a Pole, he'd be named Chopilanski, not Chopin. He's French! -He did live in Paris, but he's Polish. -Bingo. That makes him French. How about Cioran, Brancusi, Ionesco? They lived in Paris. Go ask in France. They're all theirs, not ours. French! There's a statue of Chopin in Warsaw, in the big park. -I saw it myself last year. -So what... If the Turks build Hagi a statue, that makes him Turkish? Hagi's Romanian. No one's stealing Hagi away, we'll build him a statue right here. Go to sleep. See you back Monday. Chief... Florin... Since you're here... Do you know the one about the Police Academy? The applicants must take the final exam. They're each given a gun loaded with blanks. They get sent to the next room to kill their instructor. First one goes in... He doesn't have the guts to shoot. Second one goes in, he works up his courage, but doesn't have the balls to shoot. The third one takes the gun, goes in the room, locks the door. They hear gun shots, loud noises, Lots of banging around... After 15 minutes, the guy walks out in a rage. Who's the fucker who put blanks into my gun? I had to kill him with the damn chair. Careful, Preda doesn't know this one. Come on, Florin, it won't kill you to laugh for once. Good bye, Chief. Don't let me see your face till Monday. Hello there. What time does the kitchen close tonight? 11:00 PM. I'll book a restaurant table then. -Of course, go ahead. -For 8:45 PM. Table for two. Florin Iespas. -Right. -Any rooms available? -Sure. -I'll take one, for tonight. Double bed. Any on the last floor? -Is 26 ok? -Yes. -How much is it? -250. -Any chance of a discount? -No. I'm sorry. How much for a single? 150. -A double, then. Card ok? -Sure. Your ID, please. Hello, yes, Mircea... I've left Bucharest, I'm on the road. I'll stop by the bank as soon as I arrive... Can't make it sooner than 2. I can't teleport myself, can I? You want me to fly like Gagarin or what? Gagarin... Yuri Gagarin, man! Come on, I'm just joking... I'll be there at 2. Go fuck... Can you hurry up, please? Sir, you're not allowed to park there till 5:30. It's reserved for taxis. I'm ok with it... But you might find a hole in your tire when you come back. There's nothing I can do. I'm sorry. -Can't do what? -That's it, they're taking your car. You're two months over... Almost three. Let them take it on Friday, like we said. -He can't help you. -Who? The director. They gotta repossess it, assess it, then send it to Bucharest. That's not what we agreed on. Agree on what? I tried, but he won't budge. My hands are tied. Take a seat... Come on, Mircea, sit down. Take this for now. Push it till Friday, they won't go bankrupt. -What's this? -Just put it in there. Where? I can't put it anywhere. What am I supposed to do? Tell me, what can I do? Nothing. Turn in your car. Today. And if I don't? If you don't, they'll take it. And they'll bill you extra, you'll be worse off... Why the hell did you do this, huh? I told you, it's out of my hands. I put it off as much as I could, it's done now. Put the money in and buy me more time. Put it where? They're cancelling the lease, Florin. Put this toward your mortgage. You're late with your apartment, too. -Otherwise you lose the money. -If I lose it, fuck it. Yes. Hello. Mr. Stoica, loans? Natalia Marcu. I'm a bit late, I'm sorry... -Give me two minutes, please. -Sure. -Sorry. -No problem, ma'am. Mircea... I thought we were friends. So? I helped you out when you needed it. And I didn't? What the hell! You drove me up the wall these past two years. I got grey hairs from you. Look! My wife just noticed. It's from clients like you. Mircea... Take this now. For the mortgage. I'll get the rest next week. I'll bring the car on Friday. I can't any sooner. -How much you got here? -2,000. That's not enough for the mortgage, either. I said I'll get you the rest next week. -Really? What about next month? -I'll handle it. Forget it... I've had it. I'm done. Really. You have no shame, you know. Mircea, please, help me! Mircea... take this money and get me a few more days with the car. I'm begging you, just a couple of days. -Bring the rest next week, got it? -Deal. -You sure it's 2,000? -Yes. Tell the director to leave the car till Friday. I'll ask, but not Friday. Thursday, at the latest. -Why Thursday? -Why? Cause it's what you deserve. Cause I said so. Cause you're not a man of your word and you're a jackass. Thursday, 9 AM. Go. I'll call you. Yes, come in, please. Mircea... Tell your director I said fuck his car. I don't give two shits about it, got it? He can go fuck himself, and your bank can suck it. You guys sit here in your chairs, you do nothing all day long, you just rip people off. That's what you do, we work hard and you rip us off. So fuck your director, fuck your face, and fuck your cocksucking bank. Take the car and shove it up your ass, it fits well. Got it, Mircea? You take care now. -I'm sorry. -Jesus... Well... I'm here about a car, too. That's perfect, yes... Right, I get it... He's here now. My place, he just got here. Why can't you come? No, no, my place. So what? Come now... Ok, got it. 9 PM, the hotel parking lot. 9 o'clock sharp. Yes... Thanks so much. The boy needs help, his mom is ill. I owe you for this one... I really do. Hold on a sec... One sec! I found you a job... Come up for a beer. Leave the bike here, no one's gonna take it. Come on already! No one's gonna bite you. Yes... It's not ok, you know... I barely get to see you once a year. Yeah. Of course he's ok with it. -You sure you want the job? -Yes. Yeah, of course he wants it. Ok, then, see you tonight... Well, after you're done with that... ...Chopilanski, yes. Yeah. Cheers, godspeed. Drive safe. Bye. The owner called. He's leaving Iasi in half an hour. He landed last week, but he's got a nice girl there, a flight attendant, and... he couldn't let her go. You know exactly how it is. Sorry for the mess, my wife's got some health problems... She barely made it through. Thank god Doctor Ivan operated her. Right. Let's dive right in. -Can you drive? -No. Not a driver, then... Can you cook? Not really. -Can you wait tables? -No. Can you clean? Use a vacuum? I can clean. Never used a vacuum, though. -Then, a guard like before? -Yes. Fine. I'll put in a good word, so he pays you well. And you'll work daily, not just twice a week... -Thank you, boss. -You heard the man. The Poiana Izvoarelor hotel, tonight. In the parking lot. You know where? -You sure? -Yes. Tonight? Yes, tonight. He wants to see you, shake your hand. It's how it works. Don't fuck with me, Banel. Can you do it or not? -Of course I can. -Good. We'll meet him there, talk terms, you start work tomorrow. We'll have a drink, eat something... On his dime. I'm so sorry, here I am drinking alone. -It's fine, boss. -No way... It's a bag with a bottle in the fridge. Grab it and use that to open it. I gotta take a leak. Ok then... 9 PM, at Poiana Izvoarelor, in the parking lot. Listen to me, Banel. This guy is a business man. 9 sharp means 9 sharp. Not a second later. Clear? I'll ride my bike there. I won't be late, don't worry. -Just tie it up there. -Yes. -Right. C'mon, cheers! -Cheers! See, we can talk like normal people. Why so nervous... Always so damn jumpy. Care for a smoke? Go on, take it... What's wrong, Banel? Never seen a gun before? -Wanna hold it? -No. Take it. Take it, it's fine! Go on! See, it didn't bite you. Do you know how to aim? Extend your arm... Keep it straight. That's it... Don't point it at me, you crazy... Put it down, for fuck's sake! I'm sorry, boss. I'll talk to the owner, maybe you'll get one, now that you're his guard and all... I don't need it. Oh, you like gas more, right? Tell me, I won't do anything. You prefer working with gas, right? If I get paid, I do whatever I'm asked, boss. You do, huh? Well, you'll get paid. No worries. Now get out. I've got things to do. -9 o'clock at the hotel. -Yes. -9 sharp, got it? -Yes, boss. Hey! Take good care of yourself, okay? How are you, Mrs. Eugenia. -Hello! -Need some help? No, thank you. -What happened to you? -Work stuff. Your dog came back? He did, but he's a mess, poor thing. -At least he's back. God bless. -God bless. We're in room 26. Pen and paper? Yes. Please hold. My phone's dead. Please call my fiancée. Tell her to come down. Someone broke her car window. And call the Police, have them send a squad car. Get in... Get in! Shut the door. Shut the door! Easy. Just you alone? Ashamed to look at me, Stela? Put your hand down. -What are you doing here? -What are you doing here, not me? What do you want, Florin? First, I want my phone back. I bought it, I pay the bills for it. Fine. I'll back-up everything and return it tomorrow. All right? What else? I'll take the car, too. I'll drop it off tomorrow in front of your building. No. I'm taking it now. Give me the keys. They're up in the room. Should I go get them? What room? Number 15? With Mr. Marian? Room 15, with Mr. Marian?! What do you want? I told you everything. What did you tell me? You didn't tell me shit. Help me understand... That's why I came, to talk. -What's left to talk about? -I want to understand. I'm at a loss here... After all these years, that's the kind of bullshit you do, Stela? I really wanna understand, honestly. It's all I want. Didn't you have all you wanted? Haven't I done everything for you? I asked you a question. Wasn't I faithful? Didn't I treat you nicely? Answer me. Here's an idea: Go get your stuff, come home and we'll talk it over. Marian will come down if I'm not back soon. No shit?! Let's wait for him together. How long do you think he'll be? Right! He's not coming, he doesn't give a crap about you. -You'll see. -I'll see what? And if he come down, great. We'll call his wife over. Tell her to bring the kids along, eh? We can all talk until sunrise. Except he's not coming, he's not an idiot. Is that what you want, Stela? A married man? Has a wife and kids at home, and he fucks you like a whore on the side in hotels? He doesn't want anyone to know he's fucking you. He won't give up his life for you, not in a million years, you know that, you're a smart girl. Can't you see he doesn't want to be seen with you? He's hiding everything? Come home... I won't hurt you, you have my word. I can't. I have a class in the morning. By the way... the Chief asked me to talk to you. His niece wants to take piano lessons at your school. Thing is, she's 16. -What? -The girl's already 16. It's too late. Can you do something? 16 is way too late for school. She should take private lessons. That's exactly what I said! Honest to God... Come home. I'm not coming, Florin. Why not, you fucking bitch? What did I do to you? Didn't I love you enough? You loved me? How did you love me? How did you make me happy? Mr. Marian fucks you well, right? Just curious... He fucks your brains out? Don't be an idiot. I'm an idiot?! I'll let you go, but tell me, he fucks you good? From behind? Or you're on top more? Did you cum? Tell me, just now, did he make you cum? Tell me, you filthy slut. What, you're not a slut? You fucking this guy in hotels? How long did you fuck him behind my back? You never said. Answer me, how long? Here I am working hard for you, you filthy bitch, so you have everything you want, and all the while you're screwing some other guy? I've asked you a question, Stela! Does he make you cum? Does he grab your hair when you cum? Does he grab it like this? What, you don't like that? Oh, I know you do. Let's see what's it like to fuck a slut. Might as well fuck you too, see you cum again. -You filthy bitch! -Florin, stop! You fucking whore! Hey! What are you doing?! Stop!! Help! Hey! Don't shoot!! Stop! Put out the fire! Don't run! Wait! Don't shoot! He's mad, he blew up the car! Don't run! Help! He's killing us! He's shooting at us! Stela! You crazy... Help us! Help! Help me! Stela! Help me! Please! Someone, help me! Help! Help me! Help! He set us on fire! Help! Help me, please! My fiancée is in the car. He set the fire! He killed her! He shot at us! Hurry up! He ran away... Yes. Yes, got it. You can go in. Around 4, the gypsy knocked at my door. No idea how he got my home address. He jumped me. He broke my mirror. He knocked things down... I think he was drunk. I somehow managed to throw him out. Anyway... He ran down the stairs... I was pretty shaken up, you can imagine. I took a shower, dressed up, I tried to calm myself down. When was that? I just said it... At 4, or a few minutes after. Then I went to the hotel. I left from home... Stela came straight from school. I got there first. She asked what happened to my face, I didn't want to tell her. I said a nutjob jumped us at the station, started hitting policemen... I figured I shouldn't worry her... So we can have a wonderful night. A night just for ourselves. I'm sorry... Anyway... Stela went up to change... put some make-up... She said she left her bag in the car. I went out to get it. In the parking lot, her car window was broken. I went to the front desk, called the cops, asked the receptionist to call Stela down. We both got to the car... Nothing stolen, the bag was right there where she left it. Stela got in the car. That same moment someone hit me, on the left side of my head. Like a hammer blow. I collapsed on the spot. Later I found out he struck me with a rock. I didn't faint, but I was very dizzy... there was blood in my eyes... Then the gypsy took my gun. I tried to stop him, but I couldn't... I heard Stela scream. I rushed over to her, to the car, to make sure she's ok. But he started shooting at us. A bullet got me in my left arm. I honestly thought I'll die from the pain. Unfortunately, he kept firing and... And then? Then, he threw the gun away. He grabbed a fire bomb, set it on fire and threw it at the car. I fell down on the ground. He run away... He vanished. The car was in flames... with Stela inside. At what time did you see Georgian Negoita? Banel? At 9. -9? -Yes. Did you see Banel with your own eyes at 9? Yes. I was looking at the time. 9 sharp. 9.01, tops. Florin... The car accident happened at 8.50. You hear? The gypsy died at 8.50. That's when the car ran him over. -8.50? -Yes. So, you couldn't have seen him at 9. Or 9.01. He was dead for 10 minutes. I understand. Florin... You know what I think? I think you've made a mistake. You saw him at 8.30, 8.40 at most. That's when he hit you with the rock and fired at you. A witness at the hotel says he heard a bang right around that time. That's when he first fired. He, or his accomplice. He wasn't working alone. These colored guys stick together. Besides Banel's, we found a second set of prints on the gun. His accomplice. Still unidentified... But we will identify him... right? That's who you saw at 9, throwing the gun and running away. Gypsy or not, we'll see when we catch him. I'd be shocked if he wasn't. This other guy returned after the car crash, with the gun and Banel's fire bombs, to finish the job. It was very dark. Very easy to take him for Banel. Right? I figure you passed out, from the rock or the gunshot. You're not Robocop, after all. You woke up when the other gypsy showed up and threw Banel's fire bombs. What do you think? Am I right? I'm sorry, I'm very tired. Florin... The prosecutor will be here in ten minutes. What's it gonna be? Was it Banel you saw at 9? Or his accomplice? It wasn't him. Who? -It wasn't Banel, it was somebody else. -Good. What did he look like? Tall, handsome, blonde? No. He looked just like him. That makes him a gypsy too. What did I tell you? Right. We'll call a sketch artist, get a composite going. They all look the same, though... Lizuca... Bring three coffees, the prosecutor will be here in five minutes. Thanks... And call the artist. For the police sketch. Yes, thanks. Speaking of police sketches... Never mind, it's not a good time. No, please, go on, Chief. A burglar breaks into Picasso's home. He grabs a painting and runs away. The police asks Picasso to draw up the thief's sketch. Based on Picasso's sketch the Police makes several arrests: A nun, the Secretary of Finance, and the Eiffel Tower.
