Life! If it co-operates, it will be heaven If it bears a grudge, a war will break. No matter what happens in this war, I have no other choice but to run. If I get tired and stop I have no answer to say to my wife. Even if I tell the truth, this is not the time for her to understand. I'm Shiva. This is my story. This is the story of people like me. My father strongly believed that I'll definitely bring him trouble. When he has such a strong belief, I need to trouble him. I did. Every house has a home guard without a uniform. He's called a father. Coffee. Mother! Tell him. I can't. Father. Father! I want to marry. Dear, reduce the amount of salt and pepper you put in the dishes. I guess he acquired erotomania and is now talking about marriage. The girl's name is Shruti. We have known each other for 4 years. We have been in love for 2 years already. It's been 6 months since she got a job. Her parents are looking for a groom. That's why I'm saying. Hey! While you were running with your phone to the bathroom and the bedroom, I guessed that I'll have to hear something like this. That's why I already wrote a default dialogue for you. No! By the way, who'll give their daughter to you and who'll marry you? Slowly. Slowly. We went to talk about your matter, dear. The day after tomorrow is auspicious, it seems. Call the groom's family and let's talk. Thank you, father. I won't come. What should I talk about after coming? Should we go as soon as they call us? He passed his B-tech after trying so hard. Sir, my boy can't work. That's why he's not looking for a job and is sitting idle. Marry your obedient daughter who's doing a job to our boy and cut her neck(Spoil her life.) We'll supply the blade if you want. Do you want me to go there and tell them that? Oh! What are those words? Will he be like that forever? He'll change if we get him married. He'll change. He'll change. My younger brother changed, right? You are talking about your brother. He's a donkey who gives his dowry for interests and lives. Even if his wife asks him for flowers, he'll ask her for money in return as a loan. He's an idiot and you are talking about him? Mother. Stop crying. Let's go. How far is it? -It's 250 kms away. I need to travel 250 kms to tell them that my son is an idiot? Let's go. Mister! Don't go anywhere to have coffee or tea. -Okay, sir. They won't give more than five minutes for our guy. We'll come out by the time you reverse your car. -Okay. Okay. Hi! Your saree looks good. -Thanks, Auntie. Hi! -Hi! No. No. I know nothing. You came here with no shame and why are you getting shy? Brother-in-law, how's the coffee? My daughter is a specialist in making coffee. Look, sir... I'm Prasad. I'm working as a manager at AR super market. You might have already known about them. Coming to the matter, my boy has no job. My daughter told us everything. He's trying it seems. He'll get one in 6-7 months. Then let's do all these things after 6-7 months. Well, there are no auspicious moments in the coming days. If there are no moments, then we'll get them married when we have them. Well my intention is... I don't feel right about these moments and him not having a job,  Mr.Subramanyam. I need to talk to you personally, could you please come... You can say it here. I have no problem. Give me just a few minutes. Fine… You can say whatever you want, Mr.Subramanyam. -Just a word. Look at her. She's my wife Subadra. She has pancreatic cancer. I checked with many doctors. This is the final stage, it seems. They said that she won't live for more than a year. Shruti also doesn't know about it. I wanted Shruti to get married while my wife is still alive. So when I was looking for a groom, she told me about your son. Since her childhood, I always gave her what she wanted. Her decisions were never wrong, either. I agreed to this marriage with that belief. My wife's last wish is to see Shruti's wedding, while she's still alive. You think nothing. They both will be very happy. "Like the colours in the breeze" "Like a cloud on the earth" "Like the sweetness in rain" "Like the shore coming to me" "Like hands in hands Like the paths taken" "Like a never ending hug Like never ending talks" "Breathe said it Being own today" "Blessing has sung The holy chants" "Names different Got united with marriage" "A new life This is the welcome" Knowing my pathetic state not knowing the smile Hey Lord, come to show mercy on me Hey heart… Hey heart… Hey heart… Hey heart… Hey heart… Hey heart… Shiva! -Should I switch off the lights? No. From now on, problems or solutions, happiness or sadness, everything should be between us. We should never depend on our families. Do you get that? Especially in the matter of money. You crazy! My father won't give even if we ask. I don't know about all that. We should never become lower than others. Promise me. Promise. -Good. Well, now... can I switch off the lights? Hey, Shiva! -Look, the power is gone, too. Far away from my father's screams, nearer to Shruti's office, we decided to rent a flat. The apartment I asked for is different. This belongs to our uncle mohan. Him and his wife got this built out of love. They lived in this house for 40 years happily. Now, they went to the US for their kids. They don't like to rent this. As soon as I told him that I'm asking for my daughter, he gave me without a word. All that is okay, father. But my budget is... -It will be in your budget, dear. As a father of a girl, you didn't let me do anything I should do. Please don't say no to this at least. If you both live in this house, I feel that you both will be as happy as them. Okay, father. Here, mother. Where should I keep these? Keep that there. This one, too. Put it on the upper shelf. You are so lucky. Right? You have a wife who's employed. Your father-in-law does whatever you want. And your mother-in-law who makes you feel comfortable. It's good. A charitable trust is running for you. Now you won't even have the thoughts of doing a job. Everyone is doing something except you, uncle. I'll peel your skin. Well.. Dude.. I forgot things outside. Hey! -Uncle. Come here. Hey! Here. 10,000 INR. No, father. -Don't overact. Your father-in-law did so much and if I did nothing, I'll earn a bad name in the society. Well, this is the last 10,000 bucks I'm giving you. Shiva. Wake up. Wake up. Shiva! Good morning, Shruti. Good morning. Come. Come. Sit down. I'll get you coffee. Wake up. Shiva. Please wake up. I'm getting late to the office. Fine. I'm going to take an Auto rickshaw. Let's go. Go away! Bye, Shiva. I'm getting late. I'll see you. -Shruti! You are going to the office for the first time after getting married. You'll go like this? What's wrong? Office. Why is no one here? Happy married life Shruti! Happy married life Shruti! Happy married life! Thank you. -Thank you. Thank you. Congrats, Shruti. I'm sorry that I couldn't attend your wedding. -It's okay, sir. That's why we planned this surprise. Oh my god! I didn't expect this at all. Congratulations, Shruti. Thank you, sir. -All the best. I'm a senior manager and I came at 9 am. The assistant manager came at 9:30 am. What's the use if you have so much experience? You should have some common sense and time sense. Why would you think about those senses now, sir? Let's click a selfie. Okay? Smile a little, sir. Excuse me. Who are you, sir? Sir. Hello! Hello! What? You haven't fixed this broken tap already? Where is ma'am? Ma'am? -She went to the office. Call her. Video call her. What, Shiva? Someone wants to talk to you. Greetings, ma'am. I'm Ramula. I'm the only maid in this whole apartment. You called yesterday morning and told me to come. Okay. When will you start working? I'll come tomorrow. I'll come to your neighbour Ms.Shanthi's house at 10:30 am and will come to your house at 11:30 am. Fix this time. Okay. Okay, ma'am. Bye. Bye. -Bye. Well, when I said 11:30 she agreed. Who'll be at home at that time? I'll be home, ma'am. Thanks. I guess he has nothing to do. I'm only upset because you married without telling me. You look very beautiful when you wear a saree. I want to watch you totally. Idiot! Shiva! I forgot. Keep this money. I have. Where did you get them? Look. Until you get your job, I'll take care of all your expenses. You don't have to depend on anyone. I'm here for you. Shiva. I forgot. Please get the broken tap repaired which is near the dining table. Okay. What's this, Shiva? It's the money you gave me the other day. I didn't ask you. I don't want to show my hands (beg) and ask for money from now on. What's wrong with your hand? Did your wife burn it? Why do you say that? Why do you always diss him? Who knows if he got a job? Is it? Well, it's coming. It's about to come. It will come. It's coming. It's about to come. It will come. Why are you threatening me like some storm warning? It will come for sure. You count the money. This is the first time, the money that went out of my pocket is coming back after visiting yours. Oh Lord. Dude! -Did you take all the certificates? What about the resume? Everything is fine, right? Everything is good. Look now, I'll make them go crazy. Hey! Hey! Why did it stop without me asking? You told you'll make them go crazy. You! Some cab is coming there. That's something we need to book in advance. You don't know that, either. Who's this stupid who stopped without any booking? He's our Ramesh. Come and get into the car. I'm coming. He used to talk with bus drivers a lot when he was in college. So I thought he would do this in future. It happened just like I assumed. And he's wearing an ironed shirt. And he tucked his shirt, too, like a software guy. Hey! I have a software job, too. This is my second income. I have a driver for this. That bastard is getting drunk and is troubling me. All my life is filled with tension. You have a software job and a second income and you are tense. He's getting tense because he doesn't have a job, even though he has a good percentage. I don't have tensions like you. That's because I failed in everything. I'm really cool and happy. Excuse me. Your stop is here. Don't go around with this guy. All the best for the interview. Get lost you idiot. Is this a queue or a goods train? Why is it so long, dude? What's this? Do you think I can get inside? Come with me. Excuse me, master. Please move back. It's here, dude. Hi. Hello. What's this? Go back. I was away to smoke and get my guy here and so many people came. Whatever, go back. No, brother. Anyone would put on a kerchief. As I thought it would be cheap, I kept a book. Hey! Go back! -Hey! What's this? Why are you talking too much? Hey! You'll drop down if I hit you. Hey! Hey! Excuse me. Excuse me. Do you think we are crazy? -Why do you fight for a queue? Stand here. I left him because you said. Come here, dude. We already have a lot of competition. Will you come forward, too? No need. We need to behave decently when we come to the interview. You got me in the line even though we are late. I made women shiver in fear near the water tanker. This is nothing to me. They don't know how to throw it in the dustbin. We are next. Put the button. Hold it. Good morning. That's all for today. Leave. Leave. -Oh damn! This is gone, too. Let's go. Let's go. Shruti. Where are you Shiva? I have a small interv... I came out with Koushik. I took a half day leave. We need to go to a place. Okay. I'm coming. Hey, wait! Okay. Alright. I'm really happy to share this. Mr. Prasad managed this branch very well. What is he saying? I don't get a thing. And this branch deserves praise. You brought me here? Wait, Siva. Come with me. Why should I wait? Hi, Shruti! -Hi. Why are you so late? Thank you, Mr.Agarwal. Like every year I got felicitated this year, too. Though the reason behind this is my hard work, my fellow employees co-operated with me very much. I want to thank everyone. Behind every successful man, they say, there'd be a woman. My wife Lakshmi and my daughter Prema are behind me. They both supported me very much. I want to thank them, too. He made me do all sorts of work and didn't say my name in the speech. Isn't this a shame for us, Shruti? Let's go to Kritunga and have keema biryani. Hey! Take this, too. -No, father-in-law. Okay, okay. So, Mr.Prasad. -Yes, sir. Is he your son? She's my daughter-in-law. Shruti. She's a software developer. -Good. Hi! -It's her husband. Okay, Gentleman. What are you doing? He's on the job trails. I'm sure he will crack it soon. Oh! All the best. What do you say, father-in-law? Yes, yes. The couple who lived in this house earlier, were very happy together, it seems. My father told me. Will we also be like that? Wait! Why did that doubt raise in my head? Because you are idle. I'll go to the office. You are alone in this house all day and you are having crazy thoughts. Look! We'll be happy, Shiva! Akashvani, Hyderabad The time is around 23:00. I'll take my leave. Good night. Like that, my days passed. A wife who'll give me money and kisses. What's there? It's my daily thing. I felt like I'm in a wonderful moment. "The eye with kajal" "Has tuned me" "The eye with kajal Has hidden me" "When your lip touched Tides touched my heart" "If you come to the hug My life will be out" "Hey, it flew" "Hey, it flew" "Hey, it flew" "Hey my beloved Right in front of you" "I landed like the joy You follow like a melody" "Hey my dear, be in my tune I’ve become yours" "I’m in trance with your thoughts I turned into a crazy guy" "I can’t even imagine myself without you" "What would happen to me without you" "I can never leave you being my world" 'It feels so good seeing you like this" Hey! Look if there's a spot here. It's there. I was born with a spot (Luck) then. Otherwise, why would I fall in love with Shruti? Why would I marry her? Dude. When no one trusted me, Shruti believed in me. It'll be great if I get that one job. We'll be the happiest couple in the whole world. "Hey, it flew" "Wherever you go I’ll be by your side" "Did I get a boon bigger than life like this" "Whichever side I go, it’s you my dear" "Shall I keep seeing you, though asked if this the only work" "I can’t even imagine myself without you" "What would happen to me without you" If we get married, I made a vow that I will circumambulate the temple 1001 times, Siva. Shruti! Circumambulating for 1000 times? You'll get tired. You should do it, too. "It feels so good seeing you like this" Shiva. "Hey moon far away" Come. We should walk together. "Hey, I came like you" "Hey moon far away" "Hey, I came like you" This is useless. I don't know how to cook this. Useless. This is nice. I have a lot to do with these. Enough? I never wanted to see you like this, but I'm seeing. The eggplants are fresh. Go and make curry with them. Are you doing only this? Or are you trying for a job, too? I attended an interview recently. Two rounds were done. The third round… -You must've lost it. Is it too funny to you? She's an employee here. She's not someone who pushes the trolley without any work. Thanks. I'll pay the bill. You can go home. I can pay for it. It's your wife's money. I already told the manager. Don't worry about it. Why did you tell the manager? -Hey! Nothing will happen. Hey! There are openings, it seems. You might've already understood by now where that message went. After I received the message, I did something for the first time in my life Don't misunderstand. The thing she saw was different. Shiva. If you get selected in this interview, we can go to the office like this every day. What? Are you tense? No. No. This is very easy for you, Shiva. What's your name? -Wait, man! I will send you. Wait. Excuse me. Okay. Come. Please go, sir. Let's go. Shiva! Yes. Please come in. All the best. -Thanks. He's Shiva, sir. He's Shruti's husband. Hello. Okay. Take your seat. Sure! So, can I have a look at your certificates? -Oh, yes! Please. Siva. How was it? I did great, Shruti. Is it? Good. Go home. I have some work to do. I'll finish it off and come. What are you doing? This is the office. Go now. I'll come early. Bye. Bye. Chari! Hey! -Sir. Come on. Come on. Tell me, sir. How were the interviews? -All went fine, sir. Who performed well? No one did well except Ms.Shruti's husband. Oh no! Sir! Sir! Sir! Chari! Why are you worried? Now, tell me the advantages of a couple working in the same company? I have no idea, sir. You tell me. Listen. They come on the same bike and save fuel charges. They'll work together and share the work. They don't get stressed at all. They'll be happy and the company gets profits. What about me? Should I just applaud them? Shruti. I gave her the job as I liked her from the first day. I have had something for her for a long time. I observed it, sir. But there's no use. She married as soon as she got the job. I was very upset. I'm suffering here and you are going to arrange her a bodyguard for salary, Chari? I'm sorry, sir. I didn't know that I was doing this much injustice to you. Do the justice now, Chari. I'll take care of it, sir. What about me? On site. Thank you, sir. The mail has been sent to the client. I'm waiting for the response. -Okay, okay. Yeah. Good evening, sir. -Good evening, Chari. How was the interview process? It won't be enough, if only I do it perfectly. The candidates should also perform well. That's right. By the way, Ms.Shruti's husband came, too. What about him? He's a waste, sir. He doesn't even know the minimum basics. I was already being very patient with him. But he is the worst. He doesn't have any interest in the job. He's technically unfit, sir. Oh! Sorry to say this, Shruti. Please don't mind. What's this? You said that Shiva performed well in the interview. Shruti! If he doesn't get a job in our company, how will he get it in another company? Auto! He's a waste, sir. He doesn't even know the minimum basics. He's technically unfit, sir. Ma'am. It's here, right? How many times have I told you not to put that towel there? What? Is this a house or something? How many times did I tell you to get that tap fixed? Why can't you do one little thing? Look! These plants are also getting dried up. You'll eat, right? If you wash your hands there. They'll survive. A person who likes to sit idle at home will never know about the value of a job and the responsibilities. You can't do things at home properly. How can you do a job by bending your body. Shruti! I performed well in the interview. Is it? You performed well? Wow! They told me. You performed it very easily like you'd dry a towel. I got it now. You lived depending on your father for 25 years. Now you planned to live on my income. I won't let that happen. Shiva! Why did you come here at this time? What would be there? His wife must've shouted at him. Why do you say that? Did you eat anything, Shiva? Please get that job soon, dear. Viswa who got his doubts cleared by you also got a job. Why are you the same, mother? Shiva! Hey! I lived depending on my father for 25 years, it seems. Now I'll live the rest of my life on her income, it seems. Why is your voice so different? Sorry. I depending on my father for 25 years... What's this 25 years thing? Drink it first. Come on. I lived depending on my father for 25 years... Why do you say the same again? Get up, first. Why? -Let's go home. For what? I'll brainwash Shruti and prove to her that a husband is great. By next morning I'll show her your value. I don't make you guys get back together, my father was not born to his father. Get up, dude. Get up. Come on. Blow it! I finished my duty now. I'm coming. Hey! Blow it harder. Hey! Stop it. I need to go home. Leave them. -Okay, sir. Hey! Remove that barricade. -Go. -Thank you, sir. What's this when I'm going? You are all doing your duty at midnight, it's very responsible. It's very good and it's okay. But my problem is with the sound of the wheel. I don't like it. I , too, dude. Sir. When we come next time, make sure that the wheels are made of rubber. What? Hey, Srinivas! - Sir! Bring me the machine you just turned off. You'll put the machine? For whom? Come on. Blow it. What's the score, sir? -It's 100, sir. Put it in his mouth. -It's good. It's 140, sir. -That's it. What did you say to me in the class? You said that I couldn't score more marks than you. I scored 140. Did you see? If my father was here he would've felt happy. Srinivas, take off the bike keys. Do you know where we are going? Sir, you don't know the rules and regulations. I'll ask you one thing and you tell me, I'll agree to it. What is it? Why were white coloured clothes given to the traffic police? Why were white coloured clothes given to the traffic police? I don't know. So that they could wear them. Get both of them into the vehicle. Police should stop this. -Get them in. Police should stop this. Where did I keep my phone, dude? If you go in a police jeep, Shruti will be scared. Open the door, sir. Police should stop this. Sir. Today you have pulled back the youth who were going forward. Hey, sit down. Hey! This is Madhapur. This is our area. Hey! You said that I lived depending on my father for 25 years, right? Wow! Why did you call him again after dissing him so much, Sir! What should we do with them? If we leave them here, they'll get under a moving truck and die. Take them to the station. Look. He woke up. These people get drunk and roam on the roads. He drank last night and made a huge fuss. Who's responsible if something happens to him? Shruti! -Hey! Why are you going that side? You'll have counselling. Go inside. By next morning I'll show her your value. You are like an ox. You also got caught? Not me, brother. My wife was caught. Oh. Nice couple. Hey! Silence. If you drink and drive vehicles, the only thing that'll be left on the road will be your corpses. See how much hell your wife and children will go through seeing your corpse in a pool of blood. Do you need a situation where heads and arms are broken... legs are crushed and do you live like a dead body for the rest of your life? Think about it. Don't drive when you are drunk. Issued by State Road Transport Department. I understood by that glare that something different is going to happen in my life. I feel like I'm inferior to everyone now. The money she kept daily disappeared. And the kiss, too. I always thought that I could always do it. But from that moment, I was idle. Shruti. Some invisible distance grew between us. "Oh no, why this for me" "Though all came by my side Just the luck is far away" "Like giving everything and then snatching it away" "God is playing the game of snakes and ladders" "Maybe all lines in my palm are zigzag" "Maybe none believes if shown" "Maybe God’s anger will never come down" "I may not win in the test given" "Oh no, why this for me" "Though all came by my side Just the luck is far away" "Like giving everything and then snatching it away" "God is playing the game of snakes and ladders" "Why is this punishment for me? Who is avenging over me?" "Hey God, please protect Shall I bribe you?" "Shall I correct if I did any mistakes?" "Shall I change my behaviour I had till date?" "Shall I bring down any anger I possess?" "Shall I ask for your smiles?" "Shall I distribute all the talks hidden?" "Enough that you give me a place beside you" "Shall I cut down this distance in between?" "Hey, shall I choose a new path?" "Why is this punishment for me? Who is avenging over me?" "Hey God, please protect Shall I bribe you?" Guys! I need your attention for a second out here. Let us congratulate our new manager Mr.Bhushan. Thank you. Thank you very much. If all of you cooperate with me, we can develop this company more. Shruti. You should, most importantly. -Sure, sir. Shall we? -Congrats, sir. Sit down! Sir, well. What about my US onsite? I already told you, Chari. The time has come. We are the rulers. You did very well. Your technical knowledge is superb. I'll consider you 100 percent. Thank you, sir. -Thank you. You don't worry much. We are one. I'm here for you. I'll take care. This job belongs to your guy for sure. -Thank you, sir. Thank you. For whom is the job? - For my brother. Tell him that I congratulated. -Thank you. Excuse me, can I take it? -Yeah. Shruti. Hey, Shruti! How long have you been here? I came here long back. Look at this. What's this? -Sindhura Consultancy. My elder brother didn't get a job for many days. They refered this consultancy. He got it in one week. Tell Shiva to try once. Air conditioner, it's for you. Venky! -Sir! Two girnar. -Okay, sir. What's girnar? Excuse me. Girnar is just like green tea. It's good for your health. The people who were associated with our consultancy are in higher positions in huge companies. You'll be there tomorrow, for sure. The main thing is, we have a fixed price of one million in our consultancy. One million. I got it. Venky! -Sir! Girnar is cancelled. -Okay, sir. What's this, sir? Success is something that you can't buy. Send me the mail. -Excuse me. -Okay. Tell me. I just came out of the consultancy. He asked a million. But we... Shruti! Why do you care? Don't worry. Just one month, Shruti. Give me one month's time. I will take the responsibility of landing a job. Don't worry at all, Shruti. Congratulations. -Thank you, sir... Thank you. Congratulations. Venky. -Sir. Two girnars. -Okay, sir. Now, your future is set. The consultancy asked for one million, right? Hey! Why didn't you come yesterday? My husband made a mess at home. He's a headache. Enough. I already have enough. The people who come to my home also has that. I did all the work yesterday. Go. Do you know the EMI of that? Half of my salary. My last try to make you be responsible. I don't know if it's okay if Shiva doesn't have a job. Shruti's husband should have a job. Okay, fine. Take care of it. What's wrong? Shruti gave me a check worth one million. I came out of the bank after I withdrew the cash and was about to call you. Someone robbed the bag from me. My certificates were in it, too. No one is caring about me here. Wait. I will talk to them. Someone stole  CCTV cameras in the chowrastha. Inquire a little about it. Stay on the line. I won't give much time to you, sir. Within 24 hours, you should find out where our one million is and should give it to us. Do one thing. Bring him to the station and put him on an ice block. Tell me. What's the matter? His certificates are his life, sir. He's been saying that since afternoon. Do you think he lost gold? We can't recognise it and get it back. They are currency notes. Everyone's pockets are filled with them. We can't find them easily. Go away. -What can we do if you, too say that, sir? Sorry. CI sir... You filed a complaint. We will do our duty. You may leave. Sir. I'm asking this casually. How much time do you take for that duty? Greetings, sir. Come on. Let's go. What ? -Here, uncle. Send tea inside. -If the CI beat me so hard, that means he will catch him real soon, dude. Hey! Hey! I've been here since morning. No one is looking at me. -Sir. Sir. I'm sorry, sir. What will a useless guy do, If we give a million to him? I did the same. I don't know how to show my face to Shruti. What can we possibly do now? Let's go home and tell her what happened. Let's go. Hi, Shruti! Did you pay the money? Well, Sruti... -We paid. We paid him, right? Shruti. Could you please put that knife aside and give me some water? My throat is dry. What do you mean we paid? We need to give some time to the police. What if they find the money in the meanwhile? What's that stare? You know what will happen if you tell the truth. Let's go. Shruti. Are you listening? About the project. -I know, right? What about the progress of it? We need to submit it tomorrow morning. Give me a minute.  Stay on line. What did the manager say? -Which manager? It's him. She's asking about the consultancy manager. You go home happily. Job will come to your home. Didn't he tell you the time? Ten days. -One week. One week. -Ten days. In a week or ten days. One week or ten days? One week, Shruti. Okay. Tell me now. What? What is Shiva saying? It's nothing. There's a consultancy, right? We were talking about that. Madhu. Look who he is. The dress I'm wearing. The thing I'm doing now. He's messaging everything correctly. I think he is from our office. -Is it? You keep messaging him and I'll look for him. Okay. My wife is torturing me. I wonder when he will give me the money. Send me the interest money! It's been three months. What are you seeing? The client didn't get the delivery it seems. Take care of it. Okay. She's looking at me as though she gave me a loan of ten million. Do as I say. Message him saying that he wore a blue coloured shirt. What? I'll tell you. Do what I say. You wore a blue shirt. How did she find out? What happened? The one who's doing it is the manager. Bhushan? Yes. What's this? -I got caught? You got caught with this reaction. Well... I was an assistant manager back then. I didn't have enough courage. I'm a manager now. I wanted to ask you directly. Tell me, Shruti. What do you say? Look sir! You are a manager and I'm an employee. It's good only if the gap is like this. Please don't repeat this again. You look so good in a close up when you are in anger. I know how to make you come in my way. Why did you bring me here? You have one week. Don't get tense. Let's do something. Why did this second-income guy come here? My second income will become this guy's full income. What is he blabbering, dude? That means, you... Shruti should pay the EMI for money that's not there. Here, I am... I need to pay that EMI by doing anything. I can't avoid it. What do you mean? You'll drive a cab? Do you think you are Chiranjeevi in the movie MagaMahaRaju? By peddling the cycle whole night and… -Do you have a better idea? Tell me. Hey! Think again. All these look good in the movies. What will you say to Shruti and come out? I can only say that I'm going to the office for the job. You are so funny. They ask a hundred things for the job. They'll ask the company's name, ID card and the offer letter. My wife also asked about all these. How will you manage all these? You take all the tensions and I will have to deal with them all. What's the name of your company? ARD technologies. It's your company, too, starting tomorrow. Sir! What about the ID? They'll prepare in two minutes in Ameerpet. What about the offer letter? He'll receive it in his mail tomorrow. Shruti. Can I use your laptop once? Please. Thank you. Yeah! Shruti! It came. Well... the offer letter came. Offer letter? ARD Technologies? Where is this? Where is this? Your office is there, right? It's too far from it. You don't know. Will you take a cab everyday from tomorrow? Yes... No. No. I have the bike, Shruti. I can go, no matter how far it is. They didn't mention the joining date. Shruti. Well, it's an immediate requirement. They asked me to join the day after tomorrow. Monday. Congrats, Shiva. Thanks, ma'am. -Thank you. Hey! Shiva got a job. Wow! Congrats. Shiva got a job. Oh! Congratulations. I'll take two. -Yeah. Shiva. You don't have good formal wear. You are going to the office starting tomorrow. Here. Please go, sir. Please go. Bye! -Bye!

Is it a cash trip, brother? -Yes. Super, brother. Brother, Where should you go? -Mindspace. I'll even take you to space but not to mindspace. My wife will be there. Please cancel the ride. "I can’t keep it hidden" "Why is this unnecessary tension?" "I can’t open my mouth I can’t cover up the mistake" "Why is this unnecessary tension?" Why is Shiva not home yet, dear? Son! I'm very glad that you got a job. We thought of sharing our happiness directly with you. We are able to come now. -How are you son? I'm good, mother-in-law. I always wanted to see my son like this. I'm really happy now. Move aside. Here. Eat this sweet. My darling. You might catch some bad energy from me. You shut the mouths of the people who talked bad about you. I'm not talking about you. I'm referring to the guys in the village. Come on. Come, my dear. Let's have lunch. -Are you happy now, brother-in-law? Serve him more, dear. It's over, father. I will get it. Have some pickles. -I will. Shruti... Are you happy? I don't lack anything. I'm very happy. How are you? I'm good. I have your father. He'll take good care of me. The dal is too good, dear. He'll gain weight very soon. Like my wife. Stop it. Hey, Subbarao! What did you say when you came to my son's wedding? What did I say? Your son doesn't have a job? He won't get it in the future. You said this, right? I did. My son got a job, man! -Not that, Prasad. Hey! Shut up. -Okay, bye. Hey! Don't hang up. I don't have Vengalrao's number. Convey this to him as well. Okay. I don't think I can work with these cabs. Thanks. Then how will you pay for the EMI? Get a job, brother. If you get a job the value our families give is different. That's very different. Please be careful with the certificates, brother. If you lose them, they'll say that you'll get them in 3 months if you go around them for all the SSC, Inter and B-tech. In the meanwhile you have to do a whole circus. That struggle is indescribable. Is your name Shruti, ma'am? - Yes. People who have the same as you are very kind. Is it? First, look forward and drive. Not everyone though. That's okay. "My life is going with just that one doubt" "I’ve become worse than a pick pocketer" "I’m into tension even while asleep" I have a flat in Gachibowli.

"I won’t catch the fire I won’t accept the truth" "Why is this unnecessary tension?" Why are you working so hard, Shruti? If you do what I say, from tomorrow you can be the assistant manager and assign work to everyone. Think about it. Brother. Brother. Speed up urgently. Where do you want to go brother? -Nethaji nagar, second Street. I have an interview. -You have an interview? Yeah! Come on, let's go. -Let's move. Why is this book so thick, brother? Is it Bhagavadgita in the English language? I studied b tech, too, brother. I'm preparing for the interviews. My time is running badly. -Is it? Yes. Goodness. I wonder what my destiny is. Brother! I'm getting a call for the interview, brother. Stop the car by the side. Come on, hurry. I will. I will. Okay. Okay. You said it in Nethaji nagar. My house is in Nethaji nagar. I have an interview over the phone. Do you want me to attend? No? Should I? -Don't you worry, brother. Think this as your home. I'll put the AC on 2. Do it confidently, I'm telling you. You do it. Brother. I don't have much confidence. -You attend it. Please, Brother. What do you mean? -Please, brother. You can do it, brother. Hello! What's your domain, brother? -A domain? What's that? Hello! Which course did you study in Ameerpet? That's something called dot net. -Can you hear me? Yes. Hello. Am I speaking to Giri? -Yeah. That is him. This is him. Is it a good time for an interview call? - Yes, absolutely. What happened, brother? Come on, tell me. They said they will send an offer letter in a week. -Damn, I lost this too. What? They will send an offer letter to me in a week? Why do you say that so sadly, brother? I am really shocked. I am shocked, too, brother. Why? The interview I did was successful for the first time. That means we both succeeded. Yes! Yeah! Yeah! Let's celebrate, brother. [song humming] Give us all the dosas we will eat. My darling. Thank you. -I might really give you my bad energy. Shruti! Shiva. Where are you? I'm in the office, Shruti. -Is it? I'm downstairs, I'm coming. Hey, brother! Where are you going? You look so cool without getting tense, sir. Hey, Ramesh! You also work in this office? Hey! Shruti is coming to the office. She came already. Try to manage, I'm coming. Okay. Shruti! I came to your wedding. But you didn't attend my wedding, you know. I'm sorry. -It's okay. I had a daughter. Do you know that at least? I... Shiva... -Take a look at these photos. I worked very hard, Shruti. You don't know how many hospitals I took her to. Apollo, NIMS, JIMS, KIMS, Care and Sunshine. I only had a daughter after I visited so many hospitals. Okay. Congrats. They are cleaning. Clean India. Can I go now? They took it off? Siva! Where are you? Talk on the phone. I'm sorry. Open it. -An opener? We shouldn't bring all those to the office. Look! Shiva is here. Shruti! He came. Hi. Shiva came. This is your office. Where are you coming from? Well, the office is on two floors. I have a meeting upstairs, so I'm coming from downstairs. I'm coming from upstairs. -Perfect! Perfect. Siva. -Yes. Can I take a look at your office? -Of course. You can't. -You can't. You can. Open it. Open it. Open it. This one. This one. This is Shiva's office. These are Shiva's colleagues. See. Okay. -Come on, let's go. Where is your desk? My desk? Where is my desk? Your desk? My death is confirmed. This is Shiva's desk. He comes here at 8:30 in the morning. He works sincerely until evening 5:30. He's a very sincere fellow. Come on, let's go now. -Sit down once. She's asking me to sit. What do you mean? Sru... Sit down. Sit down. I sit down. Perfect. He's looking good, right? He's good. Answer it. No, dude. No. Don't answer it. Take it. Hello? Give the phone to the idiot who's beside you. It's for you, bro. Hello? - Ramesh! Sir! Come into my cabin. Okay, sir. Take it. Hey! All the best, bro. Unbelievable. You duffer! Who the hell are they? Idiot! Why are they taking photos in the office? Sir. Come on. Speak out. Idiot. Useless fellow! Tell me who they are. Sir. Even though I have time to give you an explanation. He doesn't have time to live. Oh! What happened? Sir! That's a fatal disease, sir. Doctors said that he'll die very soon. He came to me and shared his pain. I felt responsible. He said that his wish is to do coding. What do you know? -Damn it! Sir. That's why I gave him a seat and told him to take photos. Okay, leave. Look, Ramesh. Yes, sir. -Come here. When they leave, give them two puffs in my name. Do you want me to give them egg puffs or veg puffs? Give them egg puffs. Okay, sir. He came. What? What did he say? It's nothing. You came with the family. He told me to make sure you eat two egg puffs. Why eat the food that's made out? I forget this everytime and you forgot now. I'll see you. Thanks, ma'am. The amount of calls we receive at night from the US has increased a lot, sir. There are a very few trainees. I don't know what to do. Ask Shruti to take care. Well, sir. She had a shift the day before yesterday. If she had it the other day? Won't she do today? I got it, sir. Shruti. Let's go. I need to work overtime today, too. What? He asked you to answer the client calls today, too? Why don't you tell Shiva that he's doing this? Shiva landed a job now and is happy. If say all of this to him now Leave it. Shruti. I got the first month's salary, Sruti. Pay the EMI urgently. You changed so much, Shiva. You became more responsible. I paid for the EMI. This is your first salary. Keep it with you. Just be like Shiva who's mine. Hey! Stop it. How many times should I tell you? Stop it! Why are you getting so frustrated with small things? This is not small. Shruti came late from the office yesterday. She's not like that in the previous video. Hi! Shruti! I'm sorry. Just a work thing. I'm trying to cook carrot halwa You go and fresh up. Let's eat. Okay. Sir! Why are you here? Who's Bhushan here? Come with me, I'll show you. It's him, sir. Hey! Who the heck are you? The reply to your messages. He's Shruti's husband. So what? If you dare to disturb Shruti again! You beat him and gave a warning already. He won't disturb Shruti again. If he comes again... -He's not a thing at all. I'm not thinking about that. I went to drop Shruti at her office this morning. Okay, Siva. Shruti. Is everything okay at the office? We have small work pressures, you know. Are you happy? I'm happy if you are happy. Girls love us so much! We can never reciprocate their love to them. I didn't even hesitate to lie to Shruti. I don't deserve her love. I'll tell the truth to her. I'll take whatever decision she makes after that. Brother! You said he's a software engineer. But he's driving a cab. What are you saying? Whom are you following? Don't say that. We had been following him since morning. I sent you the videos. Check them. Siva, I'm in a meeting. I'll call you back. Shruti. I need to tell you something. Okay, fine. We can talk after I come home. No, Shruti. I'm at your office downstairs. Okay, my meeting started. Good evening. -Good evening, sir. We are going to make an app urgently. Which app, sir? It's for the cab drivers. Basically, even when we send them the location, they don't know where to go and they linger in the area. It's for people like them. We design this app to make them come to the accurate location. Yesterday, a driver forgot the location he needed to go and hit me. Let's see the driver who lost his way. Hey! Isn't he Shruti's husband? We, who have software skills, are making an user- friendly app for drivers who don't have any skills. Shruti... Do you have any suggestions? You said you got a job in a week. You said you got an offer letter. You said you were going to the office. Everything! Is everything a lie? Listen to me once, Shruti. When no one believed you, the love of you made me trust you. You cheated that love, Shiva. I don't even want to ask you what you did with that money. I couldn't even be with you for a year after marrying you. I can't even imagine my future with you. You are driving a cab, right? Pay the rent with that money. "No problem if the whole world says anything to me" "Story will turn into vacuum if you say" "Has some sin haunted continuously?" "It lit a fire without doing any mistake" "I won’t ask for any explanation" "I don’t know any times" "Our yesterdays are ruined" "Sweet memories are safe" When no one believed in me, Shruti trusted me. I'll always keep her here and take care. "I stood in fear knowing it as the truth disturbing the dream" "You made me walking distortedly stand straight, don’t leave" "This is the turn where hearts flying " "thinking to be for each other are disturbed" Shruti! Listen to me once. Shruti! Shruti! Your mother passed away. "Heart has broken" "Time committed the crime" Shruti will be with you for a few days. Okay, son. You should be careful. They stayed together in this house for 40 years, that doesn't mean they don't have any problems. They trust each other so much. I couldn't maintain that trust for just a year. Shall we go on a drive? Yes. What? Are you going to take her on-site? Chari! Quiet! Sit down. Sit down. Sit down. Sit down. What, Chari? What's the problem? You know how much I like you. Why would I cheat you? The problem here is... the male idiots are increasing in the world and the females are decreasing. We need to encourage them. We need to take care of them incredibly. For example, Mr.Murthy! Sir. Are you free this evening? -I'm free, sir. Can we go to dinner? -Let's go, sir. Do you drink? -I do. Okay. Let's have it in the evening. Okay, sir. Please be seated. Did you see? Useless scoundrels. They'll be idle. They'll come as soon as we ask. But girls won't come like that. We need to try. We need to work hard. This girl is getting married, it seems. Let this year pass. You are a man. You can go next time. Take off your hand. I did all the filthy things you told me. Don't you have a little mercy? Are you a human? What? Auntie. -Yes. Where is father? - He's there, dear. I've seen him drunk long back. He started again. I wonder what will happen to him. Shruti. It’s okay, father! Father! Mother must’ve thought about you even before a second she died. She must have died happily thinking about you, her husband, who took great care of her. You don’t have to feel bad about that dad. I feel this when I think. What have I done for your mother? I am not sure if I gave her at least half the happiness she has given me in life. I think you were this small back then. I did many types of businesses. I got cheated and lost millions. Even my father asked me to move out of the house. Your mother and I came out with you, without anything. I had no other way but death amidst all those insults. I felt like talking to your mother before dying for one last time. She came with me, trusting me after all. Subadra! What dear? Are you unable to sleep? Tell me one thing, Subadra. Like everyone else is thinking, do you also think that your husband is useless? Why do you talk like that, husband? A guy who’s lost will get a hundred doubts, Subadra. Please don’t talk like that. Whatever you did, you did it for us. You were responsible. Well, even troubles like to accompany good people. Thus, they surround. They enhance their will power, turn them into great people and leave. You’ll achieve what you wished for some day. I’ll be right by your side until I see your victory. Sleep peacefully now. My courage has left. I became alone. Your mom wished to see your marriage before she died because she doesn’t want you to be alone. She stopped me from telling you the truth that she’d die. She sent me to talk about marriage with Shiva. Please don’t mistake me, uncle. It is enough if you just have a heart to love. But one should have eligibility to get married. I don’t have that now. I’ll definitely marry on the day I get that. I understood, son. You’re thinking about society's opinion, right? I’m not answerable to anyone, uncle. Except for two people! To Shruti, who loved me and to my conscience! When you thought about everything, I, as a girl’s father should think, I understood how responsible you are. But the eligibility and job you say are too small when compared with the last wish of a mother. Respecting the last wish of your mother, which is to see your marriage, Shiva agreed to your marriage. Maybe a person who understands what is being said would be a good person. But a person who understands the pain of the guy who’s saying it will become a person with a great heart. A good hearted person will have a problem, dear. They can’t express their pain. They can’t run away from responsibilities. They never cheat their loved ones, no matter how difficult the situation is. As far as I know, Shiva is such a person. Such people can achieve anything when a person of their own are by their side. Don’t let go of that hand, dear. Hello! Hello, Ms.Sruthi. This is Chari. Your husband’s performance was great the other day in the interview. But Bhushan deliberately tore down your husband’s interview papers. One more thing! The other day in the meeting, he said that a cab hit him. It’s a lie. Your husband hit him really hard for harassing you. Anyway, I’m very sorry. I couldn’t even be with you for a year after marrying you. I can’t even imagine my future with you. I’ll be right by your side until I see your victory. I’m here for you. “My story got a twist” “Your magic worked“ “Sleep in my eyes diminished“ Shiva! Shiva! Shiva! “Hey heart…“ “Hey heart…“ “Hey heart…“ “Hey heart…“ “Hey heart…“ “Hey heart…“ Don’t always look into your phone. Kaushik. Where is Shiva? -He’s upstairs. What happened, Shruti? Shruti! Shruti! Shruti! Say that you forgave me. What do you mean, Shruti? What are you saying? Just say that you forgave me. love you, Shiva! I can’t say anything more than this. Shruti, where are you going? Where is Bhushan? I’m happy to announce the new collaboration with your Company. And I’m looking… Yes! You dare to hit me? You messed with me and I let it go. But you messed with Shiva. Look, how many interviews you attend and fail, I’ll always support you. But, you… -I experienced hell because of a lie, Shruti. I’ll never lie again. Even that one million… You said that you would never lie again. That’s enough. It is very tough to get a job in the market now. Is it necessary to hit him now? Well, let’s go together for interviews starting tomorrow. Let’s go! If we consider the odd situations we face as an experience... move forward with love and understanding each other, every marriage will be great. Mr Shiva! -Yes! Please come with me. But the interview is at the site. -No, no! Follow me. Are you sure, it’s me? I’m A. Shiva... A! Please come in, sir. Sir, Shiva is here. Brother! Ameerpet. Dot net! Domain? I’m a CEO now. Order a lemon juice for my brother. What sir? Lemon juice! Lemon juice. Yeah. Go and get it. -Ok sir! How are you, brother? The other day you were running while eating corn dosas. And today you are standing in front of me like this again. I’m very happy, brother. Brother, what’s this suit and set up? There’s a story behind that, brother. Pattubala Chiranjeevi Reddy, my father-in-law… He asked me to get a small software job with my capacity and promised to give his whole property along with his daughter to me. All this is because of the job you got me the other day. All this is because of you, brother. Tell me brother. What post do you need in this office? Take whichever post you need. But, except for just my post. No, brother. What about my interview… Do it, brother. Go ahead. Take interviews of all who have come. -Brother. You know the value of hard work, brother. You won’t let another person face difficulty. Am I right? Sir! -Yeah, good! Brother. Take this lemon juice and give up your phase of unemployment from today. Take it. All the best for your future! Go ahead!
