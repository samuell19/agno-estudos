SCHOOLYARD BLUES You're not really asleep, I can tell. - What are you doing here? - Shh, don't wake Mom. You're not allowed to be here, so why are you home? Get dressed. Do you know that it's my first day at school? Of course I do. Come on. Me and Marten.... Me and Marten are in the same class. - We want to sit next to each other. - Be quiet! But Marten's mom said boys have to sit next to girls, so I'll be sitting next to Emelie.... There are different sizes here, for when you grow. Try this one on. Go down here and change every day before school. Here's more.... Oh no.... Crap! Shit, how could I forget about that? I'm so damn stupid! Stop it! Stop it.... We'll take care of it on the way. Stop chewing on your shirt. - You're not a baby anymore. - I wasn't thinking. Hey, John... - Where are you going? - To the bus stop. You don't take the bus to school. I don't want to walk! School's too far away.... Give me a break! Stop running! Listen to me! Shut up! You don't take the bus. You stay away from the others. Let's go.... What the hell are you doing here? I know who you are! You aren't allowed to be here! - You must have run away.... - Let go! Let's go. I don't want to. I want to go home. Have you wet your pants? They're going to think I'm only, like, 4 years old.... Show me your hands. Don't you trim your nails? They fall off after a while. There's nothing other kids hate more than long nails. When did you last take a shower? I don't know. Now remember to trim your nails. Turn your head to the right. Shower every other day. Mika, was that lady the mother of the guy you beat up? Yeah.... At roll call, the other parents will be there. Say that Mom's at work, at a day care center. And that she's so sorry she couldn't be there. But Mom doesn't work. You need to make things up when it comes to our mom. Here's a good stick. I'm always on the look-out for sticks and rocks and stuff. Kids get scared off when you carry a big stick. I hate you, you piece of shit! Go to hell, you creep! You're dead meat, you bastard! Die! So now what do you do? I can't get away.... There's always something you can do. You could spit me in the face. Good, that throws them off-balance. Do whatever hurts the most as fast as you can, then run. What if there are lots of them? I can't beat them all up.... Well, then you wait until it's over. What do you mean, "over"? You cover your head like this. You curl up... ... and wait 'til it's over. So if somebody comes at me like this, and he's not alone... Then you stand as long as you can. And when you can't do it anymore, curl up on the ground like this... You creep! I'm gonna kill you! Die! Are you dead yet? Hey, Mika.... What's the matter, Mika? What's wrong, Mika? I recorded some instructions for you. Press there.... Wash clothes every other week. Istvan on the 4th floor will help you. For school outings. Bring a packed lunch. Like one of those Gorby pies, an apple and a fruit drink. There are loads of instructions. Here, take it. But that's yours. It's okay, I don't need it. - Take this too. - I don't want to take your stuff. You might as well have it all. Right... You'd better go now. Will you be there when I get home? No. - What about Christmas? - I don't know. Maybe by the time I'm in third grade? You've got to go now. John.... Don't tell anyone I'm your brother. Okay.... - Elisabeth Jernberg? - Present. - Hasti Ghazvini? - Present. - Emma Johansson? - Present. John Berntsson? Where is John? What? What are we supposed to say? - "Present". - That's right. Welcome, John. - Linnea Fernando? - Present. - Leo Taube? - Present. - Yes, John? - I just wanted to say... That my mom is sorry she couldn't be here. But she had to go to work. - At a day care center. - I see.... Well, that happens. - Havanna Andersson? - Present. - Smilla Romanova? - Present. SCHOOLYARD BLUES
