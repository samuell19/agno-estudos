We prepared for her arrival by building the pen and... Why do you even watch the local news? Aren't you gonna be late? You should quit smoking. It gives you cancer. So what do you like most about your experience raising a lamb for the fair? I like the experience of managing money and budgeting and... I'm gonna need your help for my Hometown History paper. Okay. Later today. Is Kat sleeping over this weekend? Yeah, but you're probably gonna have to lie to her dad again. Oh, you know I hate doing that. Yeah, but they'd freak if they knew you were working nights. Why? You guys are smart. I trust you. Notice anything different about me? Yeah, they're huge, Abby. No! I pierced my nose. Mm. So? Is Dad gonna be coming by to pick up his stuff? Just asking so I'm not here. You know, you're gonna have to see him sooner or later. Why? You don't. That's different. But Mom... Abby!

Did you mom look at it? Stop it. Why didn't you just go get it done? DIY, Kat! I can't afford to have people do things for me. So, my dad's trying to force me to join an Ag-Ed internship. So why don't you just tell him you don't wanna do it? Right, 'cause that's always worked well with him. Hey, virgins. Oh, hey, it's you. - Hey. - Hey, guys. I thought I smelled cow shit. I was supposed to register today, but this place blows. - I call ditch day. - I'm in. - Abby! - What? Let's all go. You know I can't go, and Mr. Sosa's gonna ask where you are. Don't you have to be registered to ditch? I... I can't ditch today. Yeah, me either. My father's threatening to send me to school in Japan if I don't make honor roll this year. Your dad's from Japan?

I'm gonna have a party... and we've gotta spread the word... except the shit-kicker. Well, I'm going to class. Will you bitches hurry up? You're gonna get me fired. Oh, relax. This party will change your life. Mm, I'm sorry, I don't hang out with teenagers. You're still a teenager. Mm... Oh, customers. So, where are your parents gonna be? Bakersfield, campin' out for the races. Yeah, Karen and Stepdude... take that... are always gone. Pops is pissed about it. I'll probably move back to LA, live with him. You just got here. You can come visit me this summer. And warning: you won't want to come back here. 20 dollars. Mm-hm. Best party of your life. Really? No. Uninvited. Don't... don't mind her. Enjoy.

She loves having Kat over. So Abby, what is your Hometown History paper about? I know you girls better do something. You guys better start thinking about jobs.

Yeah. I can't believe you like him. Do not just me for being a Styler. I'll cut you. You know, guys, I don't know about you, but I am sick of these fascist scumbag politicians. - Oh, God. - Seriously! They just want us to sit down and shut up. They don't care about us. They don't care about you, they don't care about you, they don't care about you, and you guys are all asleep. - What about me? - And you need to wake up. - Seriously! - Sit down, drama queen!

You cannot get crabs like that! - Oh my God! - Oh my God! Shit. We need to take her to the hospital. Well, how does it look? Uh, hardcore. Let's go drink. Come on. Hello! - Hey, girls. - Yeah? You guys want some beers? - Heck yeah, man. - All right. Whoa, what the hell happened to you? I got punched. Yeah, right. Yeah. You should see the other guy.

Oh, no, I don't... I don't really like to drink that much. Do you wanna walk? You and me? Yeah. What, you don't trust me? Come on. Where are they going? My dad used to bring me to these as a kid all the time. You need a flashlight. Your dad used to bring you to wash fish do it? That's... That was some father-daughter time? Huh? My dad used to take me to bars. Not in the bar, obviously. He'd make me wait in the car. You know, father-son bonding shit. Hm. Well... does he like your band? Oh, he died a couple of years ago. Oh God, I'm sorry. No, that's okay. Yeah, I remember... at his funeral, everybody was talking about what a great guy - he was. - Yeah? He was a drunk asshole. My mom kinda... checked out after that, so I split. I haven't been back since. So you left home? Yep. How old were you? 16. Really? My dad's gone, too. When did he die? He didn't. My dad got a woman at work pregnant. Shit. Yeah. I guess he loves her. At least that's what he told my mom. Honestly, I'm never talking to him again. I told him I... wished he was dead. Never told anyone that part, though. Come on. Come on. Come on. Hey, uh... I heard about this open mic night thing and I, uh... I got an idea. For you? Well, you know, we could really use someone like you on the stage with us. Seriously. If we got in a boat... and we just... went out until we hit land, where do you think we'd end up? China? China. How cool is that? I'm going. To China? Everywhere. Where do you wanna go? I don't know, nowhere. Oh, come on. You must wanna go somewhere. London? Abby on Abbey Road? Come on, let's go. We'll ditch the van, we'll fly. We'll fly out to London, Manchester, and then... we'll go to China. "We?" Yeah. It might look a little more like Bakersfield, Hemet, and the middle of America but... That's how you change the world: one shitty little town at a time. Music can do that. We should probably go back. Let me go first. Careful. Come here. Come here. Oh, my shoe got soaked! My shoe got wet. Here, come sit here. Come sit. You can't have wet shoes. You'll get a cold. Yeah. You'll freeze to death. Better? Yeah, better. He doesn't talk about it much, but for a long time... my grandfather worked the strawberry fields. It's okay, Kathleen, take your time. My grandfather worked the strawberry fields, even slept out there at night, all to save money to bring my abuela and my mom to the US. Now, we try to pay back his sacrifices by working hard and doing our part to contribute to our town and the community. "They do not know my name, but they will know of my hard work," and this, beautiful people, is what the great Cesar Chavez fought so hard for. Farm workers are an integral part of how our great country runs. Kathleen, beautiful and fascinating family history. Thank you. And why do we tell our stories and learn about history? Because those who forget the past are condemned to - relive it. - Yes. Hey! Everyone except Abby is excused. What a real treat to have you in class today. Am I being punished? You know, I don't believe in punishment. I just thought we would have lunch together today. Did you bring any lunch? No one eats lunch at lunch. Really, now? Hm. I grow this myself, you know? Mm. Here you go. Mm. So, how's your paper coming along? I see. Well, maybe you'll get inspired on our Hometown field trip. What am I supposed to write about?

In 1945, this church became the home of displaced Japanese-Americans after being released from camps during the war. This church gave them shelter and food. A number of families were forced to live here, since everything they owned was taken away from them. One of those families was my grandfather's. Isn't that just fascinating?! You're way too excited about this. And why do we tell our stories and learn about history? Because those who forget the past are condemned to relive it. Yes! I can't remember what I did last night. Uh, could we, uh, walk around? Yes, please! Respectfully, people. You never told us that your families were in the camp. Why should I have to tell you? Your parents grew up here too. Everybody's stupid parents grew up in this town, whatever. So, I've been thinking about the open mic tonight. Can't, I have taiko practice. That's the Japanese drumming, right? But tonight? You guys have to come. Why don't you understand? I know my parents, my life, is just some joke to you, but I have other things that are expected of me, Abby. Yeah, but Dave asked me. You don't even care! I... I do. Furukawa? Your parents worked that farm? So, our families actually worked the same farm, then. Yeah, cool. Still mad at you, though. Okay, everyone, this way, please. This way. Come on! You're gonna love this story. The local mission sponsored a rescue operation to save the southern Channel Islands' remaining Native American population, although did we know they wanted to be rescued? During the rescue, a storm arose! And realizing the imminent danger, the ship left, leaving one person... a young Juana Maria... behind. It took 18 years and several expeditions back to the island to try and find her. Eventually, they were successful in bringing her to the mainland. The sad part is she died from illness seven weeks later. But that's just one version of the story! Oh man, I love this. Some say she actually boarded the first ship... and, realizing her child had been left behind, dove overboard! She swam back to the island knowing she would be left behind! Amazing, isn't it?! A mother willing to give up everything for her child. And who doesn't love romantic stories, huh? Are you mad at me about something? Oh my God, it's huge. Sure, laugh away. This is the last time you'll be seeing me outside of class. Because of a hickey? No, because my parents found me on the front doorway sleeping in a pile of vomit! I can't believe you left me there. Well, how was I supposed to know?! I just... You're the one who ran up and rang your own doorbell! How was I supposed to know that they wouldn't open the door?! I ran away! I just can't believe you let that guy suck on your neck like - that. - I feel sick. It's funny! You're such an ass! Yeah, strawberries! Like how do you know which ones are ready to be picked? Did you like the Lone Woman story? To think she lived alone for years on that island peacefully, until she was rescued. She only died because she stayed to save her stupid kid. And he died, anyways. You didn't tell that part of the story. She could've saved herself. True. And who knows how long she would have lived if man just left her alone. Men mess up everything. I see. Isn't it crazy? Farmers will have to feed nine billion people in 2015. "Feed the nine." I heard about that. I mean, I know you guys, like, worked on farms and helped raise animals and stuff. Well, yeah, I know you think it's not cool. No, I just... I wanna know more. We also do a lot of community service events, and it's just awesome to belong, to have a support system and... What are you talking about? Do you have to wear that jacket everywhere? Jealous much? When did Kristi get here? - Kristi, let's go! - Okay. Kristi, right now! Go. You're supposed to use this stuff, right? Chris, come on. Do I look like I know anything about gardening? Help me! Okay, all right, you're totally stressing me out. Why are you even doing this anyways? Maybe I'll really love gardening. What do I ever do besides work? Not much lately. Seriously. What do you do? Besides mothering that brat you birthed? Well... you care for the neighborhood ill repute when his own family's disgraced by him. You can still move in, you know. And live in this pig sty? No, no, thank you. Actually, you know what? There is something that you can do right now. What? Cook. Cook. , come on! I'll get right to it. Don't let it die. There's supposed to be a liquor store up here that'll sell to us. What the hell were you and Cheryl talking about? Why does it matter? I'm just... I'm so over it. I was talking to Cheryl because... I took the Ag-Ed internship and... I'm thinking about joining the FFA. What?! Are you kidding? You're becoming one of them?! I'm not becoming one of anything! You're becoming an aggie asshole! You're such a sell-out! Sell-out?! You're the one who's turning into some stupid Kristi clone! Hey! At least I'm not turning into some loser who gets stuck in this stupid shit town like everybody else. That's what I can never get! Why do you always say that?! What is so bad about being here?! Look around! You're not better than anybody else here! Fuck you, Kat. Great. How am I gonna get to this open mic now? Are you serious?! What is your problem?! Do you have any idea how much trouble I'm in?! Fuck her, right? You want a strawberry? Strawb? Hey! What's cookin', good-lookin'? License, insurance, and registration, please? Hm, yeah. You know, I think I, um, left it at home, actually. Kathleen! Whoa, whoa, whoa,? Identification? That's my daughter. And we speak English. Okay, so don't let me ask you again. - Can I see some identification? - Dad! Perfect, now you got my whole family in trouble. Who's in trouble? My dad, Abby! The cops can't do that, okay? They're not gonna take him in. Oh shit, your dad's illegal? - Kat, vamanos! - Kathleen, now! Vamanos! We are so over! Okay. Kristi Lewis, Abby Evans, it looks like we can't get a hold of either of your parents. You're here? Why didn't you answer the phone?! What happened? I... I turned it off! There was an incident with your daughter and her friends involving a stolen car. I'm letting her off with a warning. Lower that! You stole a car?! I didn't steal it, it was Stepdude's. Who? Never mind! Someone could have gotten hurt! Am I supposed to ground you now?! Right. I want someone to ground you. - I'm sorry, what did you say? - Nothing! Okay, I... I heard you. Help, the kitchen's on fire! Stop, stop. Hey, we are not done talking! So now you wanna talk? Whatever, I'm going out. Hey, the cops just brought you home. Where the hell do you think you're going? - Out! - Abby! I'm going out with Dave, okay? There's an open mic tonight. Dave? So there's a guy. You're singing? Why didn't you tell me any of this? Who are you? Who are you?! I'm figuring it out! Is that okay with you? It's a little late to be figuring things out. Look... you get to wear what you want, you get to listen to what you want, you get to go where you want, because I couldn't. It really is just about you. You're not going anywhere. You know what? From now on, I want you to tell me everywhere you're going! Okay. All the time! Ugh! We are not done yet, Abby! I want you to come to my work tonight because we need to finish this talk! Ugh. You idiots! You know, you're both exactly the same! Woohoo! - You ready? - No. Come on! Hey, give us a second, give us a second. No, come on! One second, one second. What's wrong? You know the song, don't be nervous. No, it's not that, it's my mom. Let's go. Okay, but... can we please stop at my mom's work first? - Yeah. - Okay. Come on, come on, come on. Right? Stealing a car, being brought home by an officer. I... I never did that. - I never did that! - No. I just, like, I can't with her right now. Hey, do you know where my mom is? Oh, hey. - Yeah, she's in 3118. - Thanks. You know, sometimes, I... I think and I'm like, "If I could go back and make a different choice, maybe... maybe I wouldn't be a mother right now," you know? Well, maybe I wouldn't choose you either. Hey, Abby? No, no, Abby? Abby! - The second time. - Yeah? You have to make sure to slide up. Don't tell me how to play the bass! Hey, I'm coming with you. - You wanna come? - Yeah. - Really? - Mm-hm. Well... You guys, time to celebrate! Abby, we're gonna pave the way. We're gonna pave the way for something big, something innovative. You sure about this? Coming on tour with us, that's what you want? Yeah. I'm sure. We're not gonna get there in time, man. Well, whose fault is that? Not my fault this time. Well, for the first time. True. She's going to hate me forever. No. I didn't mean it. I was just venting. I know you were. What am I even doing? Oh, you're just being a mother. Nobody tells you what a shitty job it actually is. Me? I'm getting out of here tomorrow. Ow. I don't know about that. Let her make her own decisions... this time. You think? Yeah. You love her. That's enough. Is that what happened with your daughter? That's a longer story. You got me thinking. No reason I shouldn't pick up the phone and call her. Then she'll come back home, right? Maybe. ♪ My love, whoa ♪ ♪ Whoa ♪ ♪ Come back to me, come back ♪ ♪ And whoa ♪ ♪ Oh ♪ ♪ And oh, dear heart ♪ ♪ Where have you gone? ♪ Thank you, everyone. Chris!

Typical Dave. - Hey. - Hey. I thought you had taiko practice. I know but... Abby. Well, yeah, I mean, I think we're... Doesn't it give you that kind of song... - No. - Yes. It freaks me out. Oh, shit. We're on. All right. - "Love Will Tear Us Apart." - Where have you been, man? Okay. Okay. Stop, stop, stop! I... I'm sorry, can we just... Can we start over?

Haha, yeah, yeah, look at me.- Whoa, stop, Abby. - Who cares? - I care. No, you know what they say doesn't matter, right? It matters to me! No, Abby, what matters is... stop! Look at this! Abby, what matters is what I know to be true. Stop! You gonna protect your little faggot friend? - Abby, d... - Abby, what are you... Go head and try. Put it down. Abby! Abby! Abby! Hey! What are you doing up so early? You look like shit. You're just getting home? Damn! I bet that was fun. You live here now? Yeah. Yeah, my mom kicked me out so I'm living with my aunt. Hey, come inside and meet Jax. I like your nose piercing. This is Jax. Um... Congratulations. I'm sorry I haven't called or visited. It's okay. I'd rather be raging too. Can you believe it? Here. There, bubby. Me, a mom? I miss hanging out with you guys. Yeah, um, I gotta go. Wait, stay. - Here. - Oh... Look, I, uh... Check this out. I got this thing now called WIC where they just give me free food. That's cool, right? At least I don't have to go to school. Well, then, what are you gonna do now? I don't know, my aunt, uh, she has a part-time job down at Food Mart. You know, she's been there for, like... 20 years, so she thinks she can get me a job. - You know? - Yeah. You know?

I didn't mean what I said yesterday. It doesn't matter. I'm leaving. Leaving. Where? I can't be stuck here. I... I need... I need to get out of here. I hate this place! And I hate everybody in it.

Are you kidding me? All romantic notions aside, a mother's love is incomparable. Why, you been thinking about it? A little. I noticed your bag. Were you going somewhere? You know, you and I are a lot alike, Abby. We're both natural-born rebels. That kind of restlessness never dies. It's not a bad thing. Did you know I was 16 when I came here? Really? I left for a little, went to school up in Berkeley. So why did you come back here? You know, we were trying to change things... and then, I got involved with some questionable people. I guess you can say I lost my way. But even rebels need a place to come home to. When you lose your way... and you will... there is really only one place where you kind find yourself. Hey. Look... Is there still room for me in the van? Really? Abby, that makes me so happy. It didn't mean anything and... I'm an idiot. Yeah. You are. Everything I ever said to you was real. Just don't talk to me. ♪ There was no one around ♪ ♪ There was no one there but me ♪ ♪ I was staring out a window ♪ ♪ I was standing by the sea ♪ I'm glad you came. So what about seeing your dad? Um, I haven't heard from my dad since I was seven. Hey, just think, Abby, you're never gonna have to come back to this shithole town again. Place fuckin' stinks. Ick. Stop. Stop the van. Abby, wait. Abby! Hey! Don't go! - I thought you liked me. - I did. But I can't go with you. Wait. You know, you're amazing. Yeah, I know. This assignment was supposed to be my Hometown History essay... but I'm gonna record it because I have something to say. I've lived in this same house in the same town with the exact same friends my whole life. But for some reason, I've always felt like I didn't belong, like I was different. I... I always wanted out. But now, I'm not even sure I know what that means. I thought that being brave meant leaving, but staying and facing things... that takes guts. ♪ Don't walk away ♪ Now, everything has changed. And I don't know what's gonna happen, and that's okay... 'cause what I do still have is a lot. I know I won't stay here forever, and maybe some day, I'll go to London or China or some place like that. But for now, this is where I belong. And no matter what happens, I know I can always come back home again. You once asked what is my favorite thing about living here. Well, now, I'm gonna tell you.
