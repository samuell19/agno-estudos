[Tristan] How far would you go to make a name for yourself? Become part of the elite? The elite, 200 years ago, it meant having royal blood. The aristocracy. Twenty years ago, it meant being loaded. Today, you can be noble or rich and still be a loser. Today, it's all about fame. Once you've tasted it, you'll do anything to keep it. Even if it kills you.

Being away from my bae got me trippin', and here comes this privileged-ass dude with his ride trying to make me feel some type of way. Epic fail, though. That's an interesting try. But no one actually talks like that. Except the principal of my high school, on second thought. Wait, Patrick Riva? -Yeah, right. How do you know? -'Cause he's my uncle. Whoa. Hold up. You're Charlotte's cousin? You're nothing like her. Okay. -So you're here visiting? -No. I'm here to do my senior year at Victor Hugo. Okay. I guess we'll see each other. -And who's your man, then? -Pierre. Pierre… [scoffs] Pierre stayed back in Paris. -He's studying to get into medical school. -Okay.

Hey, you live in Biarritz now. What are you saying? -Surfing's not really my thing. -Ah, okay, I see what's up. You think surfing is a sport for airheads. You'd much rather spend your time reading novels and sipping a cup of Earl Grey. -Well, yeah. -Challenge accepted. Tomorrow at two o'clock at the central beach? Yeah, only in your dreams.

You can't control much when you're 17, but you can control what you do with your body. And I've decided that I'll share my body with one man. -You've never believed in soulmates? -I've never really thought about it. You're nothing like Pierre who… Shit, Pierre! He and I were supposed to FaceTime. -I spy someone who's in trouble. -Maybe it's nothing. -[both] It's never nothing. -[cameras clicking] [Tristan] You should keep your phone on you like a normal person.

You're Oscar? Oscar from The Voice? Uh, yeah. Let's go. [all chuckle] [man] Hey, two days till classes start. Oh, I forgot to tell you, bro. Crazy, crazy news this year. Riva's daughter is doing senior year with us. After she spent ten years in a convent. Ten years, dude! From what I hear, she's a dweeb! [laughing] Six years. I was in a convent for six years, not ten. And I'm not a dweeb. -Oh! -I'll go put my bathing suit on. You're truly so stupid, it's… it's incredible. Really, it's just… Hold on, is she your cousin? Is it true her mom ran away with some hippy-dippy to live in a nudist colony in the States or something? -[Charlotte] Yes! -[laughing] So this is a friend of yours? Really? Well, no, but… Bruh, thanks for throwing such a dope end-of-summer party! -Make some noise, whoo! -[dance music continues] [guests cheering and whooping] Oh, my God! Still got another year left. Aren't they your friends? Honey, look at me. I got invited to these 'cause I'm the best DJ in the Basque Country. You seriously brought Proust to a party? -Mmm-hmm! -Love it! Where did you come from? -Paris. -Oh, I love Paris. Fuck the ocean. Fuck surfing. Okay, listen, don't make it obvious, but check up there. Is that… [ethereal music playing] LITTLE SOPHIE 3 Oh, Little Sophie? Chill. She goes to Hugo. No way! She was my idol! [man] At Victor Hugo, every girl wants to be Vanessa, and every guy wants to be in Vanessa. But she and Tristan are a solid power couple. They're impossible to break up. -What, these two are together? -Hey, you didn't know? -No! -They're royalty around here. Known each other since they were six years old, honey. They're both Insta-verified and have, like, ten million followers together. Excuse me, but what do you mean by "verified"? Oh, wow! Let's talk. What year is it and where are we? Uh, it's today and we're at Tristan's. Why do you ask? -No, girl. Shh, no. -It is. But-- It's actually 1782 and we're in Versailles. At the top of the pyramid, you have the king and queen. Verified King Badiola and Evil Queen Merteuil. Beneath them, you have the duke and duchess, influencers like Naya and Ari, who post about what the king and queen tell them to. Then you have the knights, there to lay down the law. Then there's the king and queen's jesters. They're there to bring in more followers. Then there's the vassals, and below them, the peasants. -Who's the hunk over there? -Ben. He's the type to hit on you online then ghost you in real life. Because you don't look like Thor the Viking. And you? -Where do you land exactly? -Me? I'm merely the merchant. At your service, my lady. Thanks. What's the merchant's role? He's in with everyone at every level, and no one can kill him because he's too valuable. Hey. You're ten times hotter than Thor. Ten times, I'm serious. -Girl, I like you. -I like you too. -[camera shutter clicking] -[soft music playing] [clears throat and laughs] Careful, a post with Charlotte Riva will lose you 10,000 followers. -A drop in the ocean. -That's how I'll get my revenge. [scoffs] You can look at yourself in the mirror and seriously say that? When will you get over the fact that you lost the 2020 challenge? -You know I loved that car. -Well, you shouldn't have bet it then. I told you you can't corrupt Riva, but if Vanessa Merteuil can't seduce her principal, then who can? Remember the 2019 challenge? Go on, remind me. I seduced a monk. Riva was this close to taking his pants off at the June festival. But then stupid Charlotte called him and he went soft. It's her fault I lost my Range Rover. Babe, you talk too much, like villains do in movies. Blabbering on at the end, explaining what the audience already knows. Fact is, I won the bet, you lost your car, and you can't blame it on the girl. Just accept that. What would you say to turning Charlotte into the school slut? Uh, no way. Not cool. Don't you want to play anymore? What are you, in love? -Very much. With you, my Little Sophie. -Shut up. Why haven't we fucked already? Because it's not in the contract. I know, I know, I know. All right, just one time. Wait… You want me to fuck you "just one time"? Not me… Charlotte. [exclaiming] No fucking way. Getting her hooked wouldn't even be hard. You're almost insulting me, you know? And besides, I have better things to do. Who's that girl? She's new, she's Parisian. She's starting at Hugo this year. And you just invited her here? Did you plan to fuck her in the garage? For your information, she's faithful to her fiancé, she believes in soulmates, she'll never compromise her beliefs, so no, I didn't plan to fuck her in the garage. However, I can make her my personal challenge this year. I'll make sure she forgets all her dumb nonsense about soulmates, marriage, and fidelity. And knowing me, she'll probably end up begging me to fuck her instead of being the other way around. I want to play this game. Fuck her, then leave her. If you fail, I get your Guéthary beach house. -Deal? -No, this one's for me. I mean, you already gave me your car, how could you want more punishment? -Then I can amend the contract. -Care to be more specific, please? Up to three hours of foreplay, blowjobs included, with an unlimited fuck plan. Specific enough for you? Well, yeah, that is specific enough. I have to use the bathroom! I hope there's TP. Little Sophie! You're my absolute idol! I used to want to be just like you! -Is it okay if I hug you? -No. I'm so happy right now. Oh, my God, maybe we can be best friends now that we're in the same class! Oh, you smell so nice. [dance music playing in background] -Bro, have you seen Célène? -She left. Here. "Dear Monsieur Badiola, my fiancé's train just got in." "I can't wait to see him. I'm leaving Charlotte in your care." "Thanks again for the invite. Ciao." Thirty seconds to make your choice. I accept. Cool.

Sorry, not sorry. -[man] Damn, for real? -Come on, hurry up. Let's go. -Hey, what are we gonna do? -Old-school. [hip-hop music playing] THE PRINCESS OF MONTPENSIER DE LA FAYETTE [gasps and laughs] -[hip-hop music stops] -Excuse me, Miss Riva. -What's that piece of paper? -[man] Damn. It's actually mine. It's just my notes… on The Princess of Montpensier. Notes on The Princess of Montpensier, I hear? Sick! Well, please, you should read them aloud for the benefit of the whole class. You can stand up if you'd like. Um, so basically, The Princess of Montpensier is about the tragic destiny of a girl who's torn between familial duty and her heart's desire. It explores the dangers of human passion in a world governed by rules of propriety that essentially condemns women who sacrifice their virtue. [man] Whoa, seriously? Dude. That's exactly it. Excellent, Miss Riva. Read the book, don't just watch Tavernier's film adaptation. [school bell ringing] Your ring's gorgeous, by the way. Where'd you get it from? -Uh, it was given to me. Charlotte! -From her fiancé. -"From her fiancé." -[influencers] She has a fiancé? One, you're getting engaged at 17 because you got pregnant. Two, you fucked absolutely everyone by age 12. Or three, you're like my cousin, who wants to love only one man! [both] News flash! The principal's niece at Victor Hugo is engaged and she's only 17! And it's her first boyfriend! #2021We'reNotPlayingHereGuys. ["Venom Perfected" by various artists ft.

Hey, celebrity! -Are you surviving your first day? -No! Oh, come on, it could be way, way worse. -Take this guy and his surf accident. -He died? Died? No, girl. Not at all. He just caught a dangerous wave and is waiting on surgery in US. -So the school started a GoFundMe. -Oh, how much have they raised so far? Thirty-seven euros. It's sad really, so many kids are rich at this school. -But no one wants to lift a single finger. -Poor Lucas. Oh, wow, a thousand bucks! Thanks, Tristan! [Tristan] No problem, man. It's funny how people do good deeds to make themselves look good -or to clear their conscience. -It could be just a donation. 95% of people who donate money report more satisfaction than those who receive. Especially when donations aren't anonymous. Isn't that right? The rest of us simply enjoy giving regardless of how it makes us look. Don't you think? What's it for? My first act as delegate will be to raise the money needed for Lucas Rodriguez's surgery. -And to get more fries in the cafeteria! -[all cheering] Hey! Hey now! Come on, keep it chill! Check yourselves, fam! Regardless, Mr. Badiola, this was sick! Big thanks to Célène who offered to help me raise the money. -[Célène] What? -[all clapping] Straight up. Pow-pow, man. Dear members of the council, our idea is to raise money from ticket sales for a play featuring Vanessa Merteuil. Held at the Casino Theater during fall break. [laughs and clears throat] Sounds lovely, but it's a bit naive. It's a thousand-seat theater. What show will you put on? -The Princess of Montpensier. -Jesus. I mean, it's just… We'll turn it into a musical. Hip-hop. Who would direct it? -Uh… -My dad. -[Tristan] Her dad. -Christophe Riva. -He's won three Tonys. -No way. -Your dad is Christophe Riva? -Uh, yeah. He's so hot. I mean, he's so hard to book. But a brilliant theater director, I… We just killed that! What? -Nothing. -No, tell me what. You're starting to surprise me, and barely anyone ever does. Madame Riva, would you go to the movies with me? To celebrate-- I have a FaceTime dinner date with Pierre. [man 1] Hey! Say it again and I'll kick your ass. [man 2] What the… Ahh! -[Tristan] Franck! What are you doing? -Having a laugh. What's it to you? Get him his crutches. -You okay? -Yeah, thanks. Sorry about that, I had to step in. Should I drop you off? -I can make it work for the movie. -You sure? [menacing hip-hop music playing] There you go, have fun. -What about my cut? -[music fading] Well done, cuz! You're amazing. Uh, Célène? Patrick just texted me, "Shit's poppin' off!" "Célène straight-up killin' it! She outta here, dawg." You know what he's talking about? -Green light from the council and theater. -What green light? Daddy? I told them that you were the one directing the show. Charlotte, do you think you could let me have a word with my daughter, please? Sure, no problem. Thank you. -Why on earth would you tell them that? -Dad, it's what you love doing the most. Musical theater, adapting the classics. Célène, when your mother died, not only did I lose the love of my life, I lost my muse. Really, I don't think I can direct anymore. At every turn in the creative process, all I feel is this horrible emptiness left in her wake. But it's just one show we're putting on. Do it for me. They'd love you. But it's fine, I guess. I'll find someone else to direct. -Someone else to direct? -Yes. -What other directors do you know? -I have some ideas. -Oh, so you have ideas? -Yes. -Like who? Tell me. -Just people, I told you. Okay. Okay, all right. Just hypothetically speaking, if I were to direct your musical, it would be for one night only. -Is that correct? -Yeah. -And how would we run the rehearsals? -Uh… I'd have to drive to the school during rush hour. I'd probably have to check to see if the theater's open for auditions, walkthroughs, testing lighting. Although I do know a good lighting tech nearby. Let me call him up and see if he's available.

No. Célène, hold up! I'm going surfing after class, but if you want, you can come to my place later to work on the play together. I'll send you a first draft for act five by tomorrow night. Bye. I just can't wait for my new beach house. Well, then? I saved the password so you can unlock it. Well, my battery's out. Oops. Mine's also dead… in case you felt like spilling the beans to your new friend. Whoa! Little Sophie! This is amazing! Is it okay if I take a photo? No. Okay. Hey. Vanessa said you needed singing lessons? Uh, yeah. Well, let's hear what you got. -Well, I did write a little song once. -Okay. Um… -I'll follow you. -Okay. [clears throat] [off-key] ♪ I don't wanna be a good girl ♪ ♪ I don't wanna be a daddy's girl ♪ [laughs nervously] Okay, hold up. Give me a second. Um… Maybe we should just start with a warm-up? Sound good? -Okay. -[laughs nervously] -What? Uh… -Yeah. -Here? -Mmm-hmm. -[Vanessa] I'll leave you both to it. -Thanks so much, V. -[Vanessa] Nope, still no V. -Right. -[Oscar] Cool? -Okay. [both exhaling] -Oops, sorry. -[both laughing] -Okay. -Okay. [vocalizing] [vocalizing] -[laughing] -Hold on, hold on. -Can you stop? That tickles. -I know. [both breathing deeply] [laughs] Sorry, give me a minute. I can't. [dramatic music playing] Yo! You coming? Not in the mood right now. Wait, Zoé! Wait! I'll go with you! [woman] Darling! -So I have an audition for you. -Great. Is it a lead role? -Um, no, but-- -Then I'm not interested. Where are we on Little Sophie 4? Did they read my script? [woman] Darling, the producers aren't too into it… REUNITED WITH MY FIANCÉ #BIARRITZ [somber music playing] TRISTAN?! Watch out, he seems like an asshole. Bitch plays it close to the chest. [Charlotte] Cuz, Pierre's called three times. Quite a long surf lesson. Between you and me, you should be careful with Tristan. I know he's hot, but he has a dark side. He does these weird bets, like, trying to ruin people's lives, and-- [phone chiming] -I'm ready to fuck Charlotte. -Okay. What was it that made you change your mind? -You can call it a personal vendetta. -Love it. I'll make sure it's all set up for you then. Tomorrow night, cosplay party. [influencer] I love cosplay! -[both] What are we wearing? -What I tell you to wear. So Little Sophie 4 is a no-go? Stand up. Turn around. Your ass got bigger. [sinister music playing] [vocalizing] [phone chimes] [Vanessa on recording] Hey, Bae. Tomorrow night, cosplay party. You and your cousin are the guests of honor. I'll send my chauffeur over at five on the dot. -Look your best. -Yes! We got invited to a party this weekend at Little Sophie's castle. -And Dad is letting us go! [laughs] -Shh. [Pierre on phone] So, bae, what are you doing this weekend? Um… Cosplay! Cosplay! [laughing] Cosplay! Come on, cuz! You must. But in case Dad asks anything, it's a girly-girl slumber party. -[Pierre] Babe! Have any plans? -Uh… I guess a girly-girl slumber party at Little Sophie's place. [Pierre] Awesome! Sounds fun. Whoa! [Charlotte] Ooh! Wow! I told you, cuz! It's a castle! Whoo! Cosplay! [whooping] She lives here all by herself? Every single day? When she was 15, she realized her parents were taking all her money. So then she got a divorce from them, and she sent both of them to live in Saint-Tropez on an actual boat. It's actually so funny because both her parents get seasick. So great! [laughs] [upbeat music playing] [Charlotte] Hey! Hi, there, Oscar from The Voice. Just Oscar. Will you save a dance for me? Yeah, I'd love to. I'll see you later. [Vanessa] All good, sweetie? -Sorry, I was actually just, um… -Do you like Oscar? Yes. Uh, when you like a boy, but you have zero sexual experience, do you… Answer is yes. Answer is always yes. You need to make your pancakes. -Huh? -You don't know the rule of pancakes? -Mmm-mmm. -The first one is shit. Just like your first time fucking. -I've never eaten pan-- -Let me explain it. When you like a boy, ignore him. Fuck someone else who you don't care about so you can get some experience under your belt, relieves the pressure. [straining] It's just kinda tight. -Do you think I should stop breathing? -Yes, good idea. -[phone chiming] -Hold on. [exclaims] -Aw, it's Ben. -Aw, Ben. WHAT ARE YOU DRESSED AS? Suddenly we like Ben who said, -"I'm gay, but you're a queen"? -He's so different on social media! Maybe you should think about making a move in real life tonight? -[chuckling] Oh, you… -[corset zips] It's never gonna happen, girl! [imitating chicken] Yeah, yeah, go on and mock me! I'm a chicken! Okay, sure! -You sure are one. -But, girl… If I step out of my comfort zone, will you do the same? Hmm? I don't know what you're talking about. -Is that right? -That's right!

You know, I don't care if Vanessa shares those videos or not. Go ahead and take me down. But just leave Célène alone. She's a good person. Thanks for the candy, bro.

You told Célène that we weren't a real couple. Right. [menacing music playing] And then what, sweetie? We announce to the whole world that we're over? Yeah. And what about your career? Don't care anymore. I'm done. You want war? Take me down and I'll take you down. Re-read the contract. You have dirt on me, I have dirt on you. Now leave me alone. You're absolutely sure about that? Who was the one who taught you how to install spyware? I have dirt that you don't know about. Go ahead and spread it, I couldn't care less. It's not on you. It's on Madame de Fuck It. And it's enough to ruin her life. I have copies. You disgust me. You're gonna dump her and you're gonna make it hurt.

But with all your precious principles, your values, your virtue, you got to be too much. And I'm over it. -It's not my fault. -It's not your fault? Wait, is there someone else? Many of them, actually. But one in particular. And it's because of her, this is for her. She's the reason I'm putting an end to this. -[softly] It's not my fault. -My God, just stop saying that! What do you mean, "It's not my fault"? But you're actually right. It's my fault. I was so stupid. Maybe it's not too late to try and win back your perfect fiancé. You forgot him quickly enough, but maybe he's still waiting for you. You're tearing me apart. -I'm just realizing who I really am. -Well, I know who you really are. You're just an asshole who's pretending to be a decent guy. There's never a good moment to dump someone. Right here, right now, is as good a time as any. Why are you doing this? He enjoys it, Madame de Montpensier. This was all a bet. -[audience] Bravo! -[audience applauding] [emotional rock music playing] [cheering] [Christophe] Thank you! Congratulations to the talented students of Victor Hugo High School! [all cheering] We should enjoy the new contract. Get off me, stop! I'll pass, thanks. I told you, you disgust me. You're a total fake. -Do you even feel anything? -Yes. You just don't understand women. Obviously not. But I do know you'd never sleep with me unless there was a game. I'd never let you fuck me in the first place. But at least I just won my own personal challenge. You'd never really fallen in love, but now that you have, you sabotaged your own great love story. And it's all for nothing. POST You're a psychopath! You're completely sick! Don't you see? You're nuts! Your sweet fans, your pretty face, what will be left in ten years when you're a botox junkie, huh? What about your audience? What do you think they're gonna say when they find out their precious Little Sophie is 100% fake? Well, you can fuck my audience! Screw all of them. Do you understand? -[audience] Bravo! -[all clapping] Bravo! [phones chiming] Hello, my loves. [sniffling] I'm always there for you, but now I'm gonna need you to be there for me. My world is crumbling. Tristan cheated on me with Madame de Fuck It, who was my friend, and supposedly engaged to be married. Can you believe it? [audience exclaiming loudly] [audience clamoring] [ominous music playing] [audience applauding] [ominous music continues] SEND TO #THE WHOLE SCHOOL [phones chiming] [gasps] Oh, my God! Oh, my God! I told you you talk too much. You can only blame yourself for this one, you joke. [Vanessa on speaker] Well, you can fuck my audience! Screw all of them. Do you understand? Little girls, moms, fucking poor people, losers, perverts that have nothing better to do all day than follow me online. Do you think I even care about social media? I was queen of the silver screen ten years ago, God damn it! And right before my big comeback, Little Sophie 4, I got fucked! They cast some ten-year-old, those bastards. They don't care about Vanessa Merteuil. So now you see, I actually hate my audience more than anything… but they're all I have left. [audience clamoring and booing] [Tristan] How far would you go to make a name for yourself? Become part of the elite? The elite, 200 years ago, it meant having royal blood. The aristocracy. Twenty years ago, it meant being loaded. Today, you can be noble or rich and still be a loser. Fuck! [Tristan] Today, it's all about fame. Once you've tasted it, you'll do anything to keep it. Even if it kills you. [melancholy music playing] [melancholy music continues] [Pierre echoing] Célène! Célène! -[Célène coughing] -[music continues] What were you trying to do? Why did you come back here? Because I said I wouldn't miss this for the world. I said "yes" to you because… my mother approved of you. She just loved you. Being with you, it was… a way to stay connected to her, you know? It wasn't right to you. I'm sorry. Maybe proposing when I did was… It was too soon. I wanted to take your mind off grieving her. So you proposed to get married out of pity for me? No, out of love. But our love is more platonic, isn't it? [melancholy music continues] [phone chiming] Vanessa and I were never truly together. It was a ploy to get more famous, get more followers. And we'd do these dumb challenges. And Célène, she was our challenge for this year. "Fuck her and leave her like the rest," was the plan. But the thing is that… for the first time in my life, I actually fell in love. And Célène, those… those things I said on stage… I was trying to protect you. It was an epic fail. I'll always love you. For real. But that doesn't matter now. [phone vibrates and chimes] [Célène on phone] You can ruin a person's life by choice or due to lack of strength. Vanessa Merteuil wasn't simply acting out of malice, and… well, I forgive her for her lack of strength. Please don't attack her online and don't smear her. We do crazy things for fame and for attention. But no matter how many followers you have, in the end, there is no glory without love. And love isn't about finding someone who brings out the best in you, but someone who shows you who you really are. Sometimes it takes several someones. We don't get to choose how we love, nor who we love. Cuz, you're the most genuine and the most wholesome person I know. And anyone who doesn't realize that, well, then they don't deserve you. I love you, Charlotte. -["Under" by Alex Hepburn playing] -[woman] Hey! ♪ Don't leave me alone with me ♪ ♪ See, I'm afraid ♪ ♪ Of the darkness, and my demons And the voices ♪ ♪ Sayin' nothin's gonna be okay, hey ♪ ♪ I feel it in my heart, soul Mind that I'm losing ♪ ♪ You, me, you're abusing ♪ ♪ Every reason I have left to live… ♪ -I'm sorry. -♪ Don't bury me… ♪ Even if you screw up along the way… who cares, honestly?
