- Subtitles - Lu?s Filipe Bernardes Good morning, madam, And I drops me tray and bang goes our best morning china. She was a great one for china, Miss Rowland was. She used to make me pay for all my breakages. It cost me more than it did her. Please keep to the point. She was fully dressed. In the same clothes she wore the night before. - And she hadn't been to bed? - No, the bed hadn't been touched. The deceased had been to a psychic meeting the previous evening. - Correct. - Did you accompany her? Not likely. Don't go for them kind of spirits. Order! Where were you between 9 p.m. and midnight? In the park with me young man. Order! Although there were no signs of a struggle, it was found that the deceased's upper plate was smashed. Can you tell the court how this might have happened? I suppose it was on the tray I dropped. No, it was in the mouth of the deceased. Oh... what ever was it doing there? - I'm referrring to her dental plate. - Dental plate? Oh, I didn't smash that one. Order! Miss Puttick, no one said that you did. But perhaps you can help the court to discover... ...how this set of teeth became damaged. Perhaps by eating something hard, nuts. I beg your pardon? I mean, was your mistress fond of sweets? Butterscotch, for instance, or perhaps nougat. I don't know nothing about nougat. But she wasn't so hard-going on ice cream. Thank you, Miss Puttick. We have been dealing with the case of an elderly lady... ...who was found dead in her own bedroom So far, we have been unable to determine the cause of her death. Nor has a considerable amount of testimony... established whether it was from natural causes... ...or due to foul play. Therefore, I suggest that you return an open verdict. - The Commissioner's expecting me. - Yes, sir, go straight in, please. - Good morning, gentlemen. - Good morning. Send for me, Sir Michael? Yes, Doctor, we're discussing this Green Valley case. Now what's your opinion of the open verdict? Well, I can only speak from the medical point of view, Sir Michael. But I consider that there's nothing to prove... ...that this woman died under abnormal circumstances. Yes, maybe so. But you know it's the second case of its kind within a few months. And both these women left their money to the same psychic club. What about this woman who predicted their deaths? Oh, yes, Miss Bell, secretary of the club. Apparently she had moments of inspiration during their seances. If we're considering murder, this inspiration seems to make Miss Bell uncomonly like an accessory before the fact. If it's murder, Sir Michael. Oh, my dear doctor, two women don't die as conveniently as all this. Oh, I know there are no signs of foul play, but... ...what about unknown poisons, for instance? Poison of any sort brings about certain physical changes. Then we're back where we started. Here we have two women who both died in an oddly suspicious manner. They both left their money to a psychic club, and in both these cases their deaths had been predicted. Inspector Kelly has been on the case. Let's put superintendent Gold on if necessary. Well... the Home Office suggested we should bring a woman detective, a Mrs. Pym, into this. A woman? A woman? What the devil's going to happen here if we have a woman working on the case? Hah! Why, the first thing we'll have is a deputation and a federation asking, um... asking, um... Well, um, will you be needing me, Sir Michael? No, not now, Doctor, thank you. But if this sort of thing goes on much longer, I shall. Come in! - Who are you? - Deputy Superintendent Pym. Oh. The Home Secretary intends to gazette you to temporary CID rank, ma'am. So I understand. They asked me if I minded leading a revolution. Revolution? What revolution? I don't know exactly, sir. I remember something about new brooms and the dust of ages. Oh, nonsense, there's no dust in this building. You will rank as a deputy chief inspector. And I will detail one of my regular officers to assist you. And you will give all your orders to the ranks through him. Come in! Must you break don't the door like that, Inspector Shott? I'm sorry, sir, but I thought you might be out. Well, you shouldn't knock at all! What's all this about? These are the files for those two open-verdict cases that you asked for, sir. All right, put them down. Shott, this is Mrs. Pym. You'll be detailed to assist her. - Have you got any scruples? - I'm an old army man, sir. Well, you understand what it is to put um with anything. Mrs. Pym, how to you propose to deal with this matter? I shall continue to be graceful, sir. - Shott, now this is between ourselves. - Yes, sir. You've got to keep an eye on that woman. Or she'll corrupt the whole force before we know it. I had some queer assignments in my time, but this is the oddest. As a matter of fact, sir, the men are getting a bit worried. Worried? Why? Well, sir... Well, come on, come on, I've been in the army too. Well, sir, they posted up a notice in the CID canteen... ...asking for names for a flying-squad duty chorus. Well, I don't blame them. This will mean we'll go to pot after this. All right, Shott, you take your files and go and find an office for this woman. Very good, sir. And see that it's as far away from mine as possible! Yes, sir, I'll clear out the broom cupboard on the top floor, sir. Good, that'll give her new brooms. Ah! Here you are, my child. Oh, but Uncle! It's much more than my allowance. Oh, don't you worry about that. I'm sure you'll know how to spend it. Buy your fianc? some ties. Mr. Loddon, miss. Hello, darling. - Good morning, sir. - Good morning, my boy. Maraday, darling, it's happened, it's happened. - What? - Haven't you seen my story about the inquest? - Story? - Yes. - Where? - There. No, I'll find it for you. Oh, yes. At the inquest yesterday on Miss Priscilla Rowland of Green Valley, the coroner, Mr. A.E. Pillar, returned an open verdict. - Go on. - That's all. - They... they had to... cut it down a bit. - Oh. What is an open verdict? Well, it means that nobody is quite sure... ...what happened. Oh. Believe me that there's more to this than meets the eye. My dear boy, I don't see what other verdict there could be. Well, if you ask me, there's something very fishy... ...about her death being predicted at that seance. - Anyway, I think it's a lot of rot. - Useful intolerance, my boy. With all due respect, Mr. Wood, I can't understand how a hard-headed businessman like you... ...can waste so much time and money on these humbugs. But they're not humbugs, Dick, I've great faith in them. Then don't blame me if you're the next one to pop off in myterious circumstances. I say, you two, can't you talk about something more cheerful? As a matter of fact, I wanted to go to the seance tonight. - I'm afraid I won't be able to. - Why, you're going back tonight? Yes, I'm only in town for a day. I have to catch the 5:20 back to Sheffield. Maraday, I wonder if you could go in my place? Explain the reasons for my absence. All right, we'll go. What do you mean "we"? Now, you'll have plenty of time to take her to dance afterwards. Well, children... Yes, I must be getitng along. - Goodbye, my dear. - Goodbye, darling. - Goodbye, boy. - Goodbye, sir. Do we, um... have to go to this thing tonight? Why, don't you want to? I hate fortunetellers. Don't be silly. You can hold my hand. I can hold your hand without going to a seance. Besides, that old girl Bell, I... I can't look at her without wanting to laugh. If you do, I'll never forgive you. Now, promise we'll go tonight. Promise. Promise. Excerpts from the registry files, updated reports of the constables concerned, extracts from the Station occurrance books, Divisional Surgeon's report, post-mortem report, post-mortem analyst's report, and the commissioner's comments. - How very exciting. - And they all contradict one another. Of course, it's a govenrment office. All for none, each for himself, everything intricate and the devil take the hindmost. - I beg your pardon! - You're welcome. Now you listen to me Inspector, I'll tell you what's here. Here we have two completely separate women... ...dying of apparently natural causes. They both leave their money to a probably phony psychic club... ...where a nutty female named Bell scores a bullseye twice by prophecying their deaths. - You seem to know all about it, ma'am. - My dear Inspector, in the way of all official secrets, my assignment to this department leaked out. So I studied the case. It's quite simple, isn't it? You make it seem so. The Home Secretary appointed me to this case... because he knows that only a woman would be good enough... ...to look natural in the part I have to play. By the way, what are you doing tonight? It's all right, it's business. And thus, if we allow our better selves to take control of our base passions, we can attain a lily-white purity... ...in keeping with the yearning of our higher aspirations. Thank you. There will now be a silver collection. - Come along, Oscar, I'm sure we're late. - Yes, my dear. I hope you didn't give the man more than tuppence. No, my dear. Oh, there you are, I told you we'd be late. Yes, my dear. You're recruits to the fold, I feel surely. - I'm afraid the lecture's over. - Oh... I'm Miss Bell, the secretary of the club. - Delighted. - How do you do? This is my brother Oscar, ex-IWM. Ex-I...? Inspector of Weights and Measures, retired. Our dear father wanted him really to follow quite a different vocation. - Really, Miss... - Green. Mrs. Green. My dear husband passed over on our honeymoon. "Acerphyditis" the doctors called it. Oysters, you know. I do hope I may be able to get in touch with him. Oh, but you will. - Mr. Mencken's the most wonderful medium. - Oh... Only I'm afraid you'll have to join the inner circle. - Oh, can we? Can we? - Yes. I think I can arrange it. Of course one hates mentioning these matters. - Money questions, always so distateful. - I quite understand. - How much is the fee? - Oh, the seance is quite free. Just a trifle towards the expenses, you know. The subscription of the inner circle is five guineas each. Of course, of course, give me your pocketbook, Oscar. Yes, my dear. Oh, you haven't brought enough with you! Look, Miss Bell, there's three pounds. Shall we settle tomorrow or would you like Oscar to run back home and fetch it now? Oh, good gracious me, no, I trust I have enough respect for the weights and measures. Now, if you'll just follow me, we'll join the other disciples. Yes, I so thank you. - Good evening, Miss Bell. - Good evening, Lady Fitzjames. Do you think we'll have a good sitting tonight? Oh, I do hope so. I feel the atmosphere's just right for us. Oh, do sit down, Oscar. We'll commence in a moment. We're just waiting for Mr. Wood and his charming niece. You know Mr. Wood, of course? The Mr. Wood, the north country manufacturer? Oh, he's our most influential patron, and so kind to us. Now, will you have a cup of coffee? Well, um... I don't mind if I do. Ollie! Ollie! Ollie, please, over here. That's three shillings. - Oscar. - Yes, my dear. What an intriguing place you have here, Miss Bell. - All right, when do we leave? - Shh! Oh, there they are. Excuse me, please. - Good evening. - How do you do? You know I'm very, very pleased to see you? Well, Mr. Loddon, I'm very pleased to see you here. All right... well, actually I really wouldn't be here at all... ...were it not for my fiancee, I mean. - And where is dear Mr. Wood? - Oh, dear Mr. Wood... He had to go up north on business, he asked me to say he was terribly sorry. Oh, but Professor Mencken will be disappointed. He was saying only today... For the sake of the newcomers, I should like to explain a few points of ritual. Please clasp hands and remain silent. We must have your goodwill before preparing to receive control. Look, look, it's beginning. They are trying to come through. But there is difficulty. There is opposition. Will all those who are not in earnest... ...kindly leave the room for the sake of the other seekers? I think I'd better go, I'll... wait for you outside. They have a message. They are trying to speak. They want to speak... ...through one of you. They are going to speak. Yes, yes, I hear. I will endeavor to hold back those who would interfere. The power is going. I can't. I can't. Now I can hear it. There is a call. A call for somebody here. I'm trying... ...to hear a name. - The three candles. - The three candles again. Now it's getting clearer. I can hear it now. It's Maraday... Maraday Wood. What's going on in here? - Where are these lights? - They've called, Dick. What's the matter, what's the trouble? There's no trouble. She's been called to a higher sphere. The young man doesn't understand it's a wonderful manifestation. Oh, nonsense! It isn't nonsense, remember those two women. What two women? Come on, I'll take you home. Where's your bag? I beg your pardon, sir, forgive me... As for you, Miss Bell, well... well... - Good morning, ma'am. - Good morning. Hope the spooks didn't keep you awake. No fear. I believe that six feet of earth and a marble slab... ...would keep anybody down, don't you? Ought to, I should say so. But we mustn't let that Maraday girl get the marble slab. You didn't take that crack doorbell seriously, did you? Well, her last two prophecies came off, don't forget. I'm not taking a chance. I want a man to watch that girl all the time now. Will you see that for me, please? All right. Hello, give me extension 495. Hello, is that the information room? Shott CID here. Pass an order for a day and night cover for Miss Maraday Wood. The studio, Green Valley. The Green Valley subdivision HQ will cross-check with you. Right. Shott, there's something here smells so strong we'll be wearing our gas masks. - Yes, the incense they used last night. - Incense my foot. I tell you that club is the phoniest setup I've ever seen. Mencken's so crooked you could drop him down a well and he'll wear away the sides. However, it makes no difference. I wonder where to begin. Well, what about that Bell woman's private life? Pretty gloomy, I should think. Oh, by the way. I want the best men you can find to make a thorough checkup on these people. Bell, Mencken, Lady Fitzjames, Colonel Brown, F.G. Wood and Richard Loddon. - You mean to root up everything they can? - Exactly, the whole lowdown on everybody. Right. - Are you going out, ma'am? - Yes. I'm going to have a look at the homes of both those dead women. Come on! Has that police seal been on since the inquest? Yes, ma'am. Oh, my poor feet. As far as I can see, Miss Rowland had very good taste. Yes, to no higher purpose but his. Come on, Shott, I want to see the bedroom. Well, if we find as little in this flat as we did in the other, it's not our lucky day. Don't worry. Oh, it's stuffy in here. There's the bed. There's where Miss Rowland's body was found. Hand me a flashlight, will you? Can't find the thing. Thanks. Open the blinds to let more light in. - Found something, ma'am? - Wait a minute. Deep scratches like there were in the other flat. Couldn't be caused whilst sleeping. Electrocution? I wonder. What are you doing, ma'am? I'm posing for picture postcards! Have a screwdriver? Yes, there's one in my utility knife. Now, there's the awl, there's the gimlet, and there's the corkscrew. Remarkable! What's that vicious thing sticking out there? Oh, that's for taking stones out of horses' hooves. Really? I didn't know you had a horse, Shott. Give it to me, I'll find it. Here we are. Let's see. You're going to take that home with you? Yes, suppose down the corridor you were to lose Mrs. Pym. That would make you happy, wouldn't it, Shott? - All right, go ahead, it's off. - Okay. Thank you. That's it. Now we're going back again to that other flat. Why, what for? I don't know, perhaps we'll find a cart for your horse. There you are. The same scratches on both of them. I'm blessed if I see the point of this, ma'am. I bet you both those sockets have had the same ill-fitting plug forced into them. Let's go back to the office at once. Now, this is what you can get for me, Shott. Electric toaster, electric drier. Fan, kettle. Iron, electric razor. - I have a washing machine downstairs. - Thank you, Father Christmas. - Now what shall I do? - Sit down. Thanks. It doesn't play tunes, you shave with it. No, I don't. You can try. Not me, I wouldn't feel safe with one of those things. You know, that toaster will do for making tea in the office. The cashier wouldn't pass the expense, ma'am. Shott, I believe you really mean that. Sit still. Pop your head in there, quick. Divisional Surgeon to see you ma'am. Speak up, I can't hear you. - Divisional Surgeon to see you, mum. - Oh, ask him to come in! Good afternoon, ma'am. I'm delighted to see you, Mrs. Pym. I'm sorry I was out. That's all right, doctor, I wanted to ask you a few questions. That is, if you don't mind being questioned by a woman. You know, prejudices and all that. Good Lord, no. I thoroughly approve of your appointment. - Thank you. Cigarette? - Oh, thanks. You examined the dead woman in this case, didn't you? Yes, I did. Weren't there burns on the body? Why? Do you suspect electrocution? I'm not quite sure, but I'm working in that direction. Oh? What are your ideas then? Well, we know that an electric bell can cause death given the right conductivity. Yes, damp hands, and damp feet, or sitting at a bar. There would be burns in those cases. You see, even low voltage electricity can leave burns on the body. Though this isn't infallible. But electrocution always causes dilation of the pupils. - And there was none in this case? - No. - You found nothing at all, doctor? - No, nothing unusual at all. Except perhaps a damaged dental plate. Yes, the coroner suggested it might be sweets. - But the maid said it was ice-cream. - Ah! Two thoughts without a single mind. Well, thank you, Dr. Warhill. I have a sort of idea with our shavers, you know what I mean? May I ask you a few questions some other time about this? - Yes, of course, with pleasure. - Thank you very much. - Shott, we're going back to that house. - But we haven't had lunch yet. Never mind about lunch, we must strike now while it's hot. Good Lord! The Commissioner's comments. After we finish this report we'll have lunch, eh? Really, Shott, don't they ever feed you at home? There's a lovely restaurant around the corner. - Here we are again. - Good afternoon, madam. - I want to ask you a few questions. - Certainly, madam. Where were you between nine and ten on the night of Miss Rowland's death? I've answered that question already. - I was down here. - You were down here all the time? Yes, except when I went round with the letters. What time was that? Oh, about half-past nine, or ten, or thereabouts. Were there any letters for Miss Rowland? Yes, I did slip one in the box. Did you hear any movement? Any noise in the flat? - Noise? - Yes. Well, come to think of it, I did. What sort of noise? Well, you know, like vacuum cleaners going. I thought it was funny to hear that sort of thing so late at night. Especially when I knew the maid was there. Thank you. Much obliged. I knew you'd forgotten something. Go and get me some vacuum cleaners. Oh, have a heart, mum. Let's have some lunch first. Nonsense. We'll have a nice cup of tea in the office. Tea. I'd have a steak and a pint of beer. By the way, what about these new people? I see they haven't paid their membership yet. Oh, Mrs. Green. Oh, that's quite all right. She said she was coming in today to pay the balance. And her brother's such a nice man. Perhaps I had better remind her. She left me her telephone number. I'll ring her up. Let me know when she calls. I want to find out a bit more about them. Oh, this curtain must be mended at once. I don't want that Loddon fellow here anymore. I think we should complain to Mr. Wood about him. Hello, Inspector. Since when have you joined the cleaning squad? Oh, she wants vacuum cleaners now, sir. Well, I've got it. Splendid, Shott. Plug it in for me, will you? Thanks. Come here a minute, will you? Well, well, I give up. Put it off. Shott, how would you kill a person with a thing like that? I'd hit him on the head with it! Oh, bad temper. Gosh! I believe you've got it. See if the Divisional Surgeon's available and ask him to come to me at once. Yes, mum. Hello? Yes. All right, I'll tell her. Hello? All right. Your maid, ma'am. Miss Bell has rung your house asking for Mrs. Green to call her. Bell, what does she want? Do you think she's trailed us? I doubt it, ma'am. I know, I promised to call there over the fees today. - Caught me just in time, Mrs. Pym. - Dr. Cole. What's this, more experiments? Doctor, I believe something like this caused those women's deaths. - What? - Now, let's figure it rationally. Now, supposing the vacuum cleaner was switched on, ...and I put this in Inspector Shott's mouth. What would happen? Why, I would send in my resignation at once! We're talking theoretically, man. Now, if it were switched on and put in the victim's mouth, what then? Supposing the lips closed round the pipe, the nose would still admit air. I simple plugging would deal with the nostrils. - Well? - Absolutely untenable, ma'am... ...and very clumsy. Well, tell me why? Well, the mouth would be in a terrible of a mess because the victim would be struggling. Assuming that the victim were unconscious. - Yes, but... - Now wait a minute. This hard metal pipe would explain the dental plate being broken. The vacuum cleaner could cause death by a sort of inverted suffocation. What would be the post mortem condition in that case? I haven't come across such a thing before. But how would you keep your victims quiet... ...while you were going through with this diabolical killing? Drugs? That was one of the first things I looked for and there's no trace... ...of anything like that and certainly no hypodermic scars. Well, what about a barbiturate, a simple sleeping draft... ...leaving no traces in the stomach? No, a barbiturate is usually absorbed almost immediately by the system. In that case, Doctor, the facts suggest that these two women were drugged... ...and then killed by a vacuum cleaner. In other words, suffocation. There aren't any of the traces left by strangulation. What if a pillow had been used? Very clever. I'm going to see Miss Bell. - Doctor. - Hm? - Can you certify people on your own? - Certify them as insane, you mean? - Yes. - No, not on my own I can't. Pity. What a pity. - Did I burn you, Miss Maraday? - No, you didn't. I'm sorry, Amy, I'm just jumpy today, that's all. - Well, it's nearly finished. - That'll do, thanks, though. Has anything upset you, miss? Oh, I'll take that. Hello? Sheffield? Yes, all right. Hello! Hello, Uncle? Darling, did you get my letter? Yes, but I can't help worrying after all, it has happened twice. Yes, yes, I know, but it was probably just a coincidence. You mustn't take all that too seriously, my dear. But, Uncle, you take it seriously. You believe in it, don't you? What? Oh, yes, yes. Hm, I'll try not to. Oh, darling, you're coming back tomorrow? Oh, that's marvelous. Oh, lovely, everything will be all right then. All right, darling, goodbye. Amy! Amy! Amy! - Good evening, Mr. Loddon! - Is Maraday at home? Is she home? She is? Fine, fine... - Who is it? - It's, um... me. - May I come in? - Oh, Dick, I was so frightened. Oh, I've been terrified ever since that seance last night. Oh, don't be so silly. - Oh, where'd you get that? - I found it. - I thought you'd come into money. - I have. Oh, come in. Believe it or not, I've had an increase in salary. - Dick! - You watch. In six months I'll be a sub-editor, in a year I'll be editor-in-chief, and in three years I'll own my own paper. - Darling, you'll own a chain of papers. - Isn't it wonderful? Now we can get married. - Let's go out and look for a house. - Oh, what's the matter with this one? - Oh, no, we can't live here, oh, no. - Why not? Well, everybody'd think I married you for your money. - Oh, tell them you haven't. - They'd never believe me. Does it matter so much what people believe? No... but rich wives and poor husbands don't mix. - We'll be different. - That's what they all say. They call it incompatibility when divorce starts and the husband gets alimony. I'm marrying you and I want to stay married to you. I don't want your wretched money busting up our lives. Couldn't you give it away or something? You could... refuse it. - It's an awful lot of money, Dick. - Oh, well... then perhaps you're right. Say, who's that man outside? Do you know him? No. That's funny. He was outside when I came and he's still there. Dick, you don't think it has anything to do with that awful prophecy last night, do you? Don't be silly, darling, nonsense. Anyway, he doesn't look like a ghost. I'll attend to this bloke. Wait here, I'll be back in a tick. Why, what's the big idea? Well, if it comes to that, I could ask you the same thing. - What are you waiting out here for? - A bus. Any objection? Oh, I'm sorry. What do you mean a bus? Buses don't come down here, this is a cul de sac. Dead end to you. Oh, so it is. Lovely view, though. Charming, look here, my fine-feathered friend, There are 97,000 miles of streets in London and you've got to pick this one... ...to do your gaping. Now be a good boy and push off. - I've got a good mind to... - Yes? All right then. No harm meant. So long, chum. Oh... so long... chum. - Oh, good afternoon, Mrs. Green. - Good afternoon. I trust you didn't come all this way just to settle your fee. Oh, but I did. You see, Oscar and I are most scrupulous about paying our debts. - Unlike any man, you know. - Quite, quite. Seven pounds debt, I think it was. So sordid. Still, one must live. Oh, dear, I can never get this silly little bag open. Can I press you to a cup of tea? Oh, thank you very much, it's very nice of you, I'd adore a cup. Then I shall go out and prepare it. Please make yourself at home, dear Mrs. Green. Indeed I will. Well, I hope I haven't been too long. Not at all. Mr. Mencken will be with us in a few moments. Mr. Mencken? That's very nice of him. Well, Mrs. Green, I hope we're going to welcome you here regularly. Yes, indeed, I'm very interested in your work. Yes, your poor dear husband was with you but for a very short time, was he not? - Ah, yes. - I trust he left you comfortably off. Excuse me. Hello? Yes? Who? Oh, yes, will you wait one moment, please? - It's for you, Mrs. Green. - But who would know that I'm here? Thank you very much. Hello? Hello, yes? Oh, speak up, I can't hear you. Oh, it's you, Oscar. Winnie! It's Toto, he's been taken ill, and I don't know what to do. Oh, no! Not Toto. Are you sure he's dying? - Come quickly! - I'll come at once. - Not bad news, I hope? - The worst. Oh, but won't you stop for your cup of tea? Not even that, my little dog is dying. Hi, Oscar! What's on your mind? Well, I couldn't think of a better one than Toto... Skip that. What's the trouble. Well, the man watching Maraday Wood's house... ...says there's a suspicious-looking man hanging around. Oh, well you'd better get out there yourself, Shott, and see what's happening. - Right. - Toss these in records, will you? - Might be dabs on it. - A plug, eh, from Bell's. Uh-huh, vacuum cleaner. All right, Amy, that's all, you can go now. - Well, ready? - No. Let's go and eat first, shall we? - Well, if it's somewhere cheap. - I thought you had an increase in salary. I had, but it doesn't start till week after next. Come on, we'll go somewhere nice. - Well, I'm... - What's the matter? There's that man again. I thought I talked to you just now. So you did. Most enjoyable, wasn't it? Cut out the sarcasm, now go or I'll have you arrested! Look here, young fellow, if you don't go away peaceful, I shall arrest you myself. - Arrest me? Push on home! - I'm doing my job here. What job? Go on, go home. - Go home, I say! - I'm doing my job. I'm not going home at all. Hey, you! What's the big idea? I can ask you the same thing. This fellow here's been watching this house all day and won't go away. Well, that man, my lad, is a detective officer. A detective? Good Lord, I have an idea. You're here on a case... A pencil, lend me a pencil, quickly. Now run along, my boy, and don't be so confoundedly impetuous the next time. If you aren't nice to me, I shan't buy a ticket to the policeman's ball. And if I have any more impertinence from you, I'll arrest you for loitering with intent. I've seen you before somewhere. Have you? Well, I get about a bit. I'm not surprised, the question is where have I seen you before. Never you mind! There are two more that look like me. I'm a triplet, see? Now run along and be a good boy. - You were saying he recognized you. - Not exactly. He couldn't think where he'd met me, but he may remember later. Well, we'll cross that bridge when we come to it. You know, mum, I don't like that fellow. I feel he's mixed up in this business some way. What, Loddon? Of course not, he's quite harmless. Yes? Remember - - -? Face of an angel, mitted baby's bonnets, and we didn't catch her till she'd cut up her third husband. Come in! Um, this is the photographic enlargement of a fingerprint we found on this plug. And this is what we found on checking up in the files. The fingerprint was made by Peter Sheridan, alias John Roberts. Thank you. Shott, do you see what I see? Look at Sheridan's face. - Good Lord, it's Mencken! - Uh-huh. With a criminal record. Do they compare? Yes, they do. Just a tick. You see, those two prongs are slightly bent. But if you push them in far enough, I think they'll connect up with the current. Yes. There's green paint on this socket. And... let's see. Two flakes of green paint on the prongs of the plug. Why, it's circumstancial as damn it, man. - You've made up your mind, ma'am. - I think I have. How was it done? It's not hard to get at. Here's this man Mencken, friend and advisor of these two old ladies. He could easily slip them sleeping drops, there are a hundred ways of doing it. And then the vacuum cleaner to suffocate them. Without any of the external indications of murder. Fiendish! But brilliant. Clever. But I can't swallow your theory. There'll be a lot that people who won't be able to swallow while I'm here. Shott, will you go and get a warrant sworn for the arrest of Mencken? Gosh! You'll get kicked if you're making a bloomer. I can take it, son. Go on, do as I say. I don't like it. I tell you I don't like it. Neither will Mr. Sheridan, alias Roberts, Alias Mencken. Buck off, Shott. This is an outrage. I demand to see your inspector. May I introduce myself? I'm Deputy Chief Inspector Pym of Scotland Yard. Oh, so that's the name. Playing detectives, eh? How dare you arrest me on these trumped-up charges. The charge is murder. Oh, I suppose you've got guns and things all covered with my fingerprints. Not exactly guns, Mr. Sheridan. Or is it Mr. Roberts, Mr. Mencken? I see, quite a talent for names, Mrs. Pym. Or is it Mrs. Green? Pity you don't apply to your detecting. You see, on the night of Miss Rowland's death, I happened to be giving a seance. - What's more, I can prove it. - Oh? And how? Nasty, isn't it? Now I can track the stool pigeons. - Well, then let's talk turkey. - Certainly. - I've brought witnesses. - Oh, where are they? - Outside. - Sergeant, we'd better have them in. Yes, mum. - Don't laugh too soon. - You'll make me die laughing. I shouldn't be too sure. Hanging is rather serious business. Miss Bell, Col. Brown of the War Office. And Mr. Wood of course needs no introduction. Miss Bell, this is Mrs., um... Pym. A detective, Miss Bell. A detective? Oh, Mrs. Green, I thought you were a respectable woman. According to this gentleman's statement, you are prepared to testify as to his whereabouts on this particular evening. Certainly. Mr. Mencken never left our company... ...between 7:00 and midnight on the evening in question. In which at least a dozen people were present. He was never out of our sight the whole time. That sounds an unquestionable alibi. There's no doubt of it. No. But the same alibi does not apply to the other death. - That of Mrs. Sullivan. - I can. I can give... I mean... Mr. Mencken has got an alibi. Why don't you tell them where you were, Henry? He was with me. You're prepared to swear to that, of course? Indeed I am. You remember, don't you, Henry, dear? Well, you mustn't try and be chivalrous now. What's my reputation against your life? You've got a very good friend, Mr. Mencken. Sergeant, I'm afraid the charge must be withdrawn. Yes, mum. Mr. Mencken can be released on assurities. Well, I should be happy to stand for Mr. Mencken, and I'm sure the colonel will. With the greatest of pleasure. You will have to appear in court at ten tomorrow morning, Mr. Mencken. - What? - Formality. The magistrate will dismiss you at once. This way, please. You know, the whole thing's beyond me. It's all very disturbing. I only arrived in London this afternoon. That's Scotland Yard for you. I wonder what my friend the commissioner would have to say about it. So long, Mrs., um... Green. The spirits will always be happy to give you guidance. Accordingly, I'm arranging for a check of ?10,000 to be sent... Come in. Your niece and her fianc? are outside, Mr. Wood. Goodness, is it one o'clock already? Ask them to come in, will you? Let's see, where was I? Oh, yes, yes... a check of ?10,000 to be sent to the Union Trust Ltd. - Hello. - Hello, children! That's all Miss Reed. Come on, aren't you ready? We'll never get a table. Oh, my dear, I'm afraid I shall have to disappoint you. I have to catch the one-thirty up North. But you only got back yesterday. Yes, I know, dear, but I just had a phone call from the factory. Darling, you're not going to miss our lunch party. - After all, I'm not twenty-one every day. - Darling, I'm terribly sorry. But that new manager doesn't seem to have found his feet yet. Perhaps... perhaps this will make up for it. It's beautiful! - Look at it! - Why, it's lovely. - It's real, of course? - Of course. Of course, yes, of course... Oh, darling, you spoil me much too much. You couldn't be spoiled. Well, I must be going. Dick, take Maraday to lunch, will you? Oh, Maraday, sign the bill in my name... and next week we'll have a real party. I'll get my bag and then we can share a taxi. Isn't it lovely? I must wear it tonight. I'll pick you up at 7:30 in an armored car. Come on, I shall miss that train. All right, coming. Are you aware that Henry Mencken was discharged in court an hour ago? Are you aware that the magistrate made what he thought... ...were very witty remarks about the Police Force? And finally, what about this? - From Mencken? - Yes, from Mencken. He's entering proceedings for wrongful arrest. The curcumstancial evidence justified the warrant, sir. The man brought along witnesses. He did more than that! He satisfied the magistrate enough to cause ridicule to be poured on this office. I knew something like this would happen by putting a woman on the case. Male officers make mistakes sometimes, sir. That has nothing to do with the case. Mrs. Pym, I'm afraid I must ask for your resignation. I was prepared for that, sir. Here it is. Dated from tomorrow. From tomorrow? What do you propose to do in the meantime? Finish the job, sir. With your kind permission. Well, it's against my better judgment. But I must think of the Force. Thank you very much, sir. But no free hand this time, mind you. You report te me here at 9 o'clock tonight. Yes, sir. What are you going to do now? Amongst other things, I'm going to have a chat with Mencken. What? - Good afternoon... - Oh, it's you! Yes, it's me... Hey! You're squashing my knee! We don't want you here! You're unnerving, Miss Bell, don't be personal. - Where is Mencken? - The Professor is out. Fine! Then us two girls can have a lovely little chat all on our own. I'm afraid I'm going to shatter your illusions, Miss Bell. Come on. You see, I've been going into all this fake spiritualism stuff. How dare you, spiritualism is not a fake. I know it isn't, I believe in it myself. But this particular joint is absolutely phony. And I think I can show you why. Hello! What's in here? See this candle? - Do you know how it lights? - Of course, it's a psychic phenomenon. My foot. Actually, that wick is soaked in a solution of carbondisulphide and phosphorus. - You're talking utter rubbish. - I'll explain. You know that phosphorus burns on its own, I suppose. Well, the wick's dipped in the solution, the carbondisulphide evaporates slowly, the phosphorus underneath ignites when the air gets to it lighting the candlewick. It can't be. Normally, this candle would burst into a flame in about five to ten minutes... ...or according to how it was set. Now, I'm going to hasten evaporation by blowing on it. Watch. See? I don't believe it. I don't believe one word of it. Professor Menckens is the most wonderful man. - Ah, here he is. - Too bad I locked the door. Oh, that's all right, there are other doors. - Oh! Oh, don't! - Make yourself at home, Miss Bell. Let me out! Let me out, I say! Do you hear? Let me out. Let me out! Let me out, I say! Put 'em up! - Oh, still after me. - Always after crooks, Mr. Mencken. Right here into that chair. - What are you playing at? - I didn't want you to fall off. Put down your right hand. Into the strap. Into the strap! That's right. Let me out. If you don't be quiet, I'll never let you out. Now the other one. Go on. That's better. What's the idea of all this melodramatic nonsense? - I want to ask you a few questions. - You can't make me talk. Very well. Hm. Have you got a license for it? Where is the mo... Where's the money. How did that get there? Wasn't one bloomer enough for you? Listen, Mencken, I risked my reputation in arresting you. I took a big chance. Uh-huh. We're flying to Athens tonight. What for? Guilty conscience? You can't prove anything. It's not against the law to carry about one's own cash. It's not your own. I went to your bank this afternoon. They very kindly gave me this, a check signed by three people. You, Miss Bell and a Mr. Edward Dixson. The director of this club. You've been at your old games again, Mencken. I rang him up. He didn't sign the check. That's a damned lie. Very well, your record also says that you did a turn for forgery in America. That doesn't make me into a murderer. Only an accessory before and after the fact. Now come on! What about this prophecy business? What about those two dead women? Who killed them? Do you deny that you got them to will their money to this club? Do you deny that Maraday Wood is the next victim? I'm not saying anything. Oh. Let me see what Miss Bell has to say about it. Come out now, Miss Bell. Oh, Professor! I'm going to have Mencken arrested for forgery... ...and I know that your prophecies were fakes. But they weren't. I assure you. - I swear it. - Are you telling me the truth? But of course I am. The mood suddenly moves me... ...and I find myself speaking without any personal effort. That is so, isn't it, dear Professor? - Of course. - Miss Bell, has he ever hypnotized you? - Oh, yes, quite frequently. - Shut up. - Why? - I see. He hypnotized you the day before... told you what to say the second time, then you prophecied without knowing what you did. Post-hypnotic suggestion. Very pretty indeed. Miss Bell, I'm afraid you've been utterly fooled. No, you have. Put 'em up! Come on, put 'em up! The old trick of table-turning again, Mrs. Pym. That way, quick, march to the chair. Now then, sit down! Right hand! - Left. - This is silly. Left! To make quite sure it doesn't work. This time... Come along, Miss Bell. Oh, but dear Professor, I'm quite sure that this is wrong. Yes, I'm afraid it is. But, you see, Mrs. Pym wants to break up the club. She doesn't approve of our talking to the dear departed. Don't you listen to him, Miss Bell, that man is a scoundrel. Come along, Miss Bell, there's a meeting in four days' time. The members will set you free. There's a hospital around the corner. Hello! Central Office? Detective Inspector Shott. Pym here. Hello, is that you Shott? I'm in the seance room. Mencken tied me up. He's loose with Miss Bell somewhere. - Send out an all-stations warning. - What? - You're not hurt, are you? - No, I'm all right. I think that Maraday girl's in danger, though. Yes, there's something fishy going on in her house. - Our man just phoned for instructions. - I knew it. Get out a squad car at once and pick me up as soon as you can. - Oh, throw a cordon around the house. - Right. Hello, transmit a message to Green Valley Divisional Headquarters. Say we're raiding the 18, Rose Walk when they surround it. Right. Hello, squad room, Shott CID here. Have a car in the yard at once, please. Right! First we pick up Pym. I'll direct you as we go. Quick! Come on, Shott, stick close to me. This bell's out of order. What the devil are you doing here? Well, I rang the bell and got no answer, so I went to the back of the house. - I got in through the scullery window. - Were the lights on? You can't, I tried. Someone switched the main off. Something very fishy's going on around here. You're telling me. All right, let Mr. Loddon get through. You'd better come with us. Shott! Keep your eye on him. - Say, who is that? - Come on! Hurry up and follow me. Come on, Shott, I want to try this one. Righto, ma'am. Hello! What's that? I'm afraid we're too late. Constable, take care of her. Yes, mum. Loddon, did you... My God, he's gone! Here, what did I tell you? Come on... Loddon! - Hey! - There he goes! Come back, Loddon! Come back! Stop, Loddon, stop! Loddon! Loddon! Stop! Stop, I tell you! Look, there they are, Charlie. Why, Mencken! Look out! Well, there's nothing we can do. Let's go down. Find the master switch, we must have some light on this. Good Lord, it's Wood. They've done the old boy in. - He'd have hanged if they hadn't. - What? And now there's Mencken. Let go of me! Let go of me! Let go, let go you! - What's going on here? - Oh, it's you, eh? Oh, don't be absurd! - I took that away from Mencken. - Tell that to the magistrate. That's Mencken's gun all right. Quick, Shott. Go on, come on. Bring them up, I shall need them. - Sergeant, you search the house. - Very well, mum. Up you go. Is that better? - Hello, darling, are you all right? - Oh, Dick! Look, I've got him. All right, Shott. Mr. Mencken. What's he doing here? All that another time. What happened? Well, Uncle arrived just after I was ready to go out with Dick. Yes? He said he'd been able to get back to my party. He mixed a cocktail and had hardly had any when... Take it easy, child. I felt awfully sleepy and it all began to whirl. And then I saw his face bending over me. Yes, Wood's your man, Mrs. Pym. He's been running the whole show. Yes, of course! He made you arrange those phony predictions... ...and influenced those two old ladies to leave all their money to the club. He had something on me in America. Fighting a blackmailer isn't easy. I suppose not. But what made you come here? Well, as you know, I tried to skip with the money. And before I went, I thought I'd try and get even with Wood. I came along here and found him trying to do this girl in. Same as he killed those two other women. Why should he want to kill me? I've gone into his affairs. He's embezzled the money he held in trust for you. Darling, you won't have to marry a rich girl after all. No, but you'll have to marry a rich man after my editor gets this story. Have a look who's here. I found this lady in the cupboard, ma'am. What, again? Why, Miss Bell, you seem to have a passion for cupboards. Oh. Mr. Mencken, you're in handcuffs. Yes, I'm afraid Mrs. Pym has got me in for murder this time. I'll stand by you. You're luckier than you deserve, Mencken. Your shot missed Wood. Paul killed him. - And you've got nothing against Miss Bell. - No. We only want her as a witness. - All right, Sergeant. - This way, please. Take him away. Feeling better? Oh, she is! Come on! Come on. I could stand for that steak and a glass of beer. Fine, let's get going. - What's the time? - Twenty to nine. - Oh, I must get back to the yard. - What ever for? I've got a date with the Commissioner. Ahh... - Subtitles - Lu?s Filipe Bernardes
