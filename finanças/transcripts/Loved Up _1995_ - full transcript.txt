(FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING) Move over! -Not again! -Oh, that's better. What're you doing? Give me a cuddle, Sarah. Been drinking, Mum? Just want to be closer to my daughter. Please! Put your arms around me. I'm cold! (SIGHS) You can't keep doing this, Mum. I have to get up in the morning. Don't you understand that I have to work? Just let me stay with you. -Oh... -I've had it with this! You've got to sort yourself out, Mum. Oh, leave me alone. I give up. No! No, you don't! Don't you dare walk out on me! Jesus Christ, sit down! KAREN: Sarah? -Hey. -What's going on? I'm going to crash with you tonight. Mum's in here. (SIGHS) -What can I get you? -Uh... A Coke, please, a Coke. Can or glass? Sorry? Do you want it in a can or a glass? Whatever's cool with you. Well, it's your Coke. And I'm easy. You can have a glass. You're very kind. Regular, diet or cherry Coke? What's wrong? You're doing my head in! It's what they pay me for. Are you like this with all your customers? No, just you. I'm serious. So am I. So... Do you come here often? (CHUCKLES) -TOM: How you doing? -All right. Feel anything? Okay. How long does it take, usually? Thirty, 35 minutes. It varies. My, um... My teeth feel weird. Yeah? Sort of stiff? -Tight, yeah. -It's on, then. -They just... -Yeah, here we go. What? Say hello to Uncle E. Hang on, is this... -You know it. -Christ! Here's the buzz. Jesus Christ! What's happening? My jaw... My jaw's gone tight. No worries. Just a muscle thing. -Have some gum. -Got any? Never leave home without it. -(RAVE MUSIC PLAYING) -I've got to get up, I've got to move. -So move! -Right, I'm moving. How's it feel? Good, it feels good. It's absolutely, definitely the right thing, except I can't move fast enough. That's a problem. Are these walls climbable? Well, you can give it a shot. Well, give us a leg-up. -You should drink some water, yeah? -What? Don't want to dry out. Water, right. Got some? Kitchen. I'll get it for you. No, no, I'll get it. I'll get it. -You come get it with me? -Yeah! All right? The first time I took it was, like, two to three years ago, before I started at the shop. We were in Wales for some reason on this really crap beach. This mate of mine gave me a Rhubarb and Custard. -So, all I can remember is dancing round this fire... -How're you? -Evening. -Even though there was no music... And then this Nazi came out of his house and told us to clear off. -Are you listening to me? -Yeah, oh, yeah. -You're not, are you? -Of course I am! Nutter! -Tom. Look. -What? I know I've only known you a couple of hours, but... -I've got to say this. -What? -Well, I think you're really great. -Yeah? Special. Yeah, you too. COCKER: And the whole top shelf's fallen on my head! (INDISTINCT CHATTERING) Tom! Where you been? All right, boys. Meet Sarah. -Hi! -These are my spars. Cocker, Dan, Ifti. -How are you doing? -All right. -Great. -Nice one! Pleased to... You know the rest. -Right, then. -Give us a hug. Who wants tea? -Tea? That'd be nice. -Sugar? -Yeah. Sugar would be great. -How many? Uh, whatever. She wants sugar, Dan. What... Oh, right. So, what have you been up to? COCKER: A little bit of planning, boy. Oh, yeah, how's it going? -Getting there. Getting sorted. -What? What are you planning? A rave. -The rave. -Cocker's dream. It's the "end of the millennium" wipe-out. When's this? Roughly speaking, 1,963 days. He's getting it in a bit early. You can't afford to wait around. All the best places have already been booked up. -Tea's up! -There's three sugars in yours. Don't take sugar. -Wembley. -What's happening? -What's happening, people? -Hi, Dez. Hi, Dez. Dez and Dez, meet Sarah. -Sarah. -Nice. How are you doing? You on one already? Got that 1,000-yard stare! DEZ 1: One of yours? -Who's a lucky girl! -Going all right? Going great. Everyone sorted for the night? I can see you two are. -Uh, not me. -Then step into my office. 'Scuse, I gotta go and see a man about a drug. (SPOOKY BY LITTLE BULLET PLAYING ON CAR STEREO) (TYRES SQUEAL) Loon! Who put that corner there? Mad as a carrot, man! -What're you doing? -Sorry. Get this. It's a mail bag, innit. Letters and the like. What shall we do? Deliver 'em. E-mail. (RINGS DOORBELL) Mr Bennet? -(DOG BARKS) -Mr Nigel Bennet? You in there, Nigel? You must be Nigel Bennet. Why? Is there a problem? What are you doing here? Just answer the question, please. Uh... Well, yes, I am. Is something wrong? On the contrary. Letter for you. Huh? What's going on? -You got the job! -Pardon me? It's on, Nige. You got it! -COCKER: Says right there. -Congratulations. Unanimously. We're all very proud. -But how did you... -Thought you'd want to know immediately, yeah. I got the job! Chain of, what's it... First rung on the ladder. Ruddy marvellous! This is really very kind of you. Would you like a cup of tea? -Tea? Yeah. -Sorry, we've gotta dash. -Long night. Many deliveries, you know. -Absolutely. (LAUGHING) Hey, I've got one here from Jennifer Finch to her long-lost sister. We can do that one later. -You all right? -Great! I got some bills here, man. I don't want to be delivering any bad news. Present for you. (LAUGHS) -What's the problem? -Rozzers. Hide the gear! Pull over. Everyone take it slow. Very gently. Don't let 'em see you move. -What's gonna happen? -I'm touching the cloth over here. TOM: No worries. We're cool. -Name? -Sorry? What's your name? Um... Where were you headed tonight? We were just going with the flow. It goes down to the end of the road, and then left. -Do you take drugs, Sarah? -Me? No. Your eyes look dilated to me. We were just having a cup of tea, now we're going home, it's all. These your friends? Yeah. Known them all my life. Pigsty! Give 'em a warning. One-nil. (ALL CHEERING) (COCKER IMITATING SIREN) Still wanna go to a club? Do you? (BREATHING HEAVILY) I swear this is the most amazing thing, but are you ever gonna come? (RAUCOUS MUSIC BLASTING) What the hell was that? It's the only thing that gets me out of bed in the morning. -So who are you, then? -What? Just kidding! Morning. -I feel unusual. -Yeah, you will. What time is it? 8:15. And up you wake. (MILK BOTTLES CLINKING) There you are. Okay? Great. Bit tired, you know? 'Course. Be a weird day. Right. So, where you going at the end of it? Why? Thought I'd give you a call, we could do something later. Oh. I've just moved out of somewhere. -Yeah, when? -Last night. Serious. Why? Oh, you know, things getting tricky. So where are you gonna stay? Um... With somebody. Oh, okay. -Why'd you ask? -No reason. I just wondered, is all. -Do you know who? -Sorry? -'Cause... -I've got a friend, Donna. She's got a place around. -You can stay here. -She's always saying I can crash if I want. Would you like to stay here? -Are you serious? -What do you think? I'd love to. Oi, you! Get your thumb out your bum! It's busy out there. Sorry. You all right? (SIGHS) Great, why? You look like you've died! Donna... -Yeah? -I've got to tell you this. I met this bloke yesterday, right? He came in for a drink. And we got talking. And we, like, had this date and I went back to his flat, and we spent the whole... And I swear... Whatever happens to me from now on, I have had the best night of my life! It's that simple. Well, go for it. And I moved in with him. You did go for it! Yeah. So what's he like, then? Great. He's great! He's so easy, so calm, so, like... Sorted. Stan? It's Tom. I just opened yesterday's delivery. The new cars are ace. Put us down for some more, will you? Yeah, very popular. Yeah, useful around the house. Knew you'd be back sooner or later. I just came for my stuff. -Only a matter of time. -I'm not staying. A week without a word, then this. What do you expect? -Your rent's late. -I'll pay. You're too right, my girl! -Where are you going? -It's none of your business. Karen asks about you, you know? -How's she doing? -How do you think? Look, Mum... You won't make me feel bad about this. I've put up with enough. You'll need your jersey, it's turning cold. I haven't got enough room. I'll get it another time. When? Look, I don't know. I'm late. I'll see you. (HANDBELL RINGS) (FOR WHAT YOU DREAM BY BEDROCK PLAYING) Later, then, If. Much later. Time to crash. You got that right! Good night, wasn't it? You know, you should go to work. Who are you, then? My boss? -Tom, can't you take the day off, hang out with me? -You serious? -Yeah, go on! -No chance. Why are you so anal? I mean it, Sarah. The job's important. You gotta pay to play. Do the work, have the fun, and be sorted. -Like it's that easy! -Just juggling, innit? Mr Sussed! It's a theory. I'm just trying to keep things sweet. They are sweet. Yeah, so, good. Let's make 'em stay that way, yeah? You shouldn't have done that. You shouldn't have called him a ponce. -Well, he is a ponce. -Yeah? And you're out of a job! Days now, you've been late, you've been surly, you've been screwing up and I just don't need it. -Is that right? -Go on, you heard me. Clear off. -And you! Still want your job? -I've got no choice, have I? (PHONE RINGING) -COCKER: Left foot, green. -(TOM LAUGHING) (GRUNTING) (CONTINUES RINGING) Do you wanna get that? -What's up, Sarah? -Jesus! It's Dez, right? Yeah, right. Oi! Excuse me... Story of my life, that is. -I lost my job today, Dez. -Yeah? Yeah. Slagged off my boss. -That'd do it every time. -Tom'll get the 'ump. -What's it to do with him? -You know Tom, he's got it all organised. -Don't want to go out with a casualty, does he? -So don't tell him. Nah, I've got to. It's up to you, innit? Dez. Can I ask you something? Yeah. What? What? Well... Is it actually possible to orgasm on E? (CHUCKLES) You're lucky he can even get it up! It's going well, then? Ace. -I moved in. -Did you? Yeah. -Great. -I left home. My mum's a drunk. Does she need any drugs? You're lucky I'm knackered. I should beat you up for that. Long night, was it? Crash at my place if you like. I'll be all right, thanks. Hey! How was your day? Same old, same old. You're back late. Well, I went shopping. You don't have to do that. I got some food in. Yeah? Why? Thought I might cook. Can you? No. Let's have pizza, then, eh? Well, I'll make a stew. Stew. Is that all right? Yeah, that'd be great. I appreciate it. -It's just, um... -What? What day is it today? -Thursday. -I thought you may have noticed by now, I usually have a pizza on a day ending in a "Y." Won't it make a nice change? No such thing, is there? Fine. Ham and mushroom for me, then, please. No, you're right. Come to think of it... Change. It'd be good, eh? Forget it. Another time. No, serious. Stew. Magic! Really? It's not worth the hassle. I'm a bit knackered, anyway. Fair enough. Pizza, then. (TOM DIALLING) Sure you don't mind? Get a move on, Sarah, it's quarter to. It's not my shift. -Are you sure? -I'm not in for a couple hours. I'll hang out here. See you later! -Morning! -All right? (KEYS JINGLE) Hi! How you been? Oh, you know. Uh... What can I do you for? Well, I... I just thought you might want to hang out. Yeah? Uh... I'm busy today. I'm working. Fair enough. You can come along, if you want. -Yeah? -Yeah. Learn some tricks of the trade. You fancy it? So where are we off to, then? Listen, when we get in, don't say nothing, all right? I've got a reputation to keep up. -MAN: Who's that? -It's Dez, mate. -Hey, Billy. What's up? -All right, mate. -Gavin about? -Nah. He's left that bit of gear for you, though. Who's this? Doesn't look much like Dez to me. Don't know. Depends what drugs you're on, doesn't it? Right. What is it, then? Bag of spikes, bag of dummies, two bags of pure. Yeah. What are the spikes cut with? Bit of whizz, bit of Harpic, same as usual. That'll be 850, please. Real stuff in your right pocket, spikes in your left, dummies up here. Yeah? What's in the left? -Spikes. -Very good. Someone comes to buy, you size 'em up, right? If you know 'em, you're gonna see them again or they're bigger than you, sell 'em the hard stuff. Weekenders, they get a spike, 'cause the little rush, they love it, don't know any better. They'll come up later on, buy more off you. Twice the profit! And tossers, or people who are already buzzing and want more, sell 'em a dummy. Got it? But why are you telling me all this? 'Cause I want you to come work for me. (PROLOGUE BY 10TH CHAPTER PLAYING) Left pocket, left pocket! You all right? Yeah, top. Wanna come dance? No, I'm gonna get a drink of water. Hey. Saw you watching. Did you call it? What do you think? You know, you're going to make a lot of money at this. Look, Dez, Tom's here. Do us a favour. Don't tell him about the job, eh? Yeah, no problem. Our little secret, yeah? You know, you're looking good tonight, Sarah. Cheers. Tom's a lucky man. -Just hope he knows it, eh? -Yeah. I want to have sex with you. If you did, and I found out about it... No, I'm serious. Best not, I reckon. Seeing as we're gonna be working together, yeah? Yeah. -Hey. -Hey. Midnight, 1999. And what you got, right... What you got... Is this tent over 'ere, which is like the wild pitch. Big fuck-off speakers, phat beats, seriously nutty shit, you know I'm saying? And then this one... No, no. Hold on... Hold on, hold on, hold on... Yeah, in here, you got your jungle. -Racist! -Whatever you call it. We're all buzzing. And then at midnight, here's the deal, man, we pull this string, yeah? Who pulls it? If. Why me? I can't do everything myself, can I? -So then what? -Then, get this, all the tents just take off, man. They just take off, like up into the air, like balloons! So where it was separate business, suddenly it's become like this big, shared thing, man. The kids are having it large, 'cause it's like a new century. We're all together on the same vibe and everyone's just totally one! Still don't get the string bit. Oh, come on. What do you reckon? One thousand, nine hundred and fifty-one days, man. I can't wait. (LAUGHING) What? What's the problem? You'll be there, won't you, Sarah? When is it, again? Come on! Why is everyone so slack? I'm trying to show a bit of enterprise, here. -Oh, God! -What's up? What's the date? -What's the bloody date? -Um... Tenth? Oh, stupid, selfish... What's the hassle? Look, I've got to borrow this. TOM: Hang on! Oi, that's his Sega, man. I'll get you another one. I don't need another one. Look, I'm sorry. Just... Later. More E, vicar? Hey! -Hey! -Hi. How you doing? How do you think? Happy birthday. It wasn't. Look, I'm sorry. I got you this. We haven't got a telly any more. But thanks, really. How is she? Like you care. Look, Karen, I can't deal with this, all right? What's going on? I went to the caff, Donna said you got the push. -Secret, that's a secret. -From who? Look, I met this guy. Oh, I get it. Couldn't get a life of your own, so you took his, right? -Forgot about us. Just left me! -It's not like that! Are you coming home now? -Please, Karen... -Where did you go? -I just... -I miss you! Look, I can't face it. (DOOR SHUTS) -Hey. -Hey. -Are you mad at me? -No. Sure? I said no. I gave it to my sister. -So she does exist, then? -What? It's just, I've never met her. Yeah, she exists. You should have her round. Don't hold your breath! Lucky I wasn't. Don't get stroppy, please! I forgot her birthday. Let's drop it, eh? -Tom... -It's dropped. Okay. Dez and Dez came by. Delivery. Wanna get loved up? Yes, please. I'm almost there. Don't stop. (CHUCKLING) (BREATHING HEAVILY) One of these days, I swear. -Wanna keep trying? -In your dreams. -You wish! -I could. -Runnin' on E? -Yeah. -Tom. -What? What you doing Sunday? (TUBE TRAIN PASSES) (RINGS BELL) Still got your key, haven't you? Chucked it away. I thought you were bringing company. He'll be here in a minute. Better come in and wait, then. Tidied up, then? Why would I bother? No reason. Heard you lost your job. Keep that to yourself. Karen upstairs? (KNOCK ON DOOR) Karen, it's me. Yeah, I know. (SIGHS) -Hey. -Hey. How's it going? Slowly. No change, then. She's trying. She is. 'Course. Are you just back here for the afternoon? Yeah. Then take me with you. Please! Don't leave me with her. Karen... (DOORBELL RINGING) Listen, I'd better... -All right? -Hey, Sarah! -I brought Cock. -Charles. Sorry. Brought Charles. TOM: Sorry we're late. Whole transport system's falling apart. -Mum, this is... -Oh, I like it. Very minimal, very spartan. Hi, I'm Tom. This is Charles. -Got you some... Sherry. -Oh, you did, did you? -COCKER: Sweet. -Then you're very welcome. So I'm with Andy, my dealer's brother. Big bloke. Mmm. Big bloke. We're hangin' out down this garage, I don't know, 5:00 in the morning. And this trucker walks by. So, I'm, like, cheery, full of brotherly love... So I go, "Morning!" He looks at me but he just keeps on walking. So Andy goes after him. Says, "Oi, my mate said good morning to you, "you're just going to ignore him?" Trucker goes, "What if I am?" Andy says, "'Cause I don't like seeing my friends dissed". So all of a sudden, they're squaring up in front of me! So what happened? Oh... Nothing. It just, like, fizzled out. You know how it is. Great story, Cock. Yeah, wicked! Thought your name was Charles. -You can call me Cocker. -I'm honoured! (DOOR OPENS) -Karen, this is... -Where'd she get that? Stop fussing! -Pleased to meet you. -Did you give it to her? Drop it, Karen. It's not worth it. Hi, I'm Cock. I didn't catch your name. -Prick. -Manners in this house, please! I insist on manners. I can't see the point of them, myself. -You let her drink. -Oh, get out! I won't have you telling me what to do! (DOOR BANGS) Look, guys, no need to get heavy. Forget her. Who? -(EXCLAIMING) -(CHUCKLING) Just have another drink, eh? Think I will. So, Tom, my favourite daughter's boyfriend... I suppose I should ask you about your prospects. Shouldn't take long. Would you say you have a lot of ambition? What, sorry? I liked your mum. Yeah, sound geezer. You fucked up, Tom, you fucked up! We were just doing a bit of whizz and thought it'd be a good idea. Well, it wasn't, bringing along your stupid mate! -Your mate, too. -Not for long, I tell you! Tell me a bit louder. They're just always there, wherever you go! At the shop. Here. They follow you about like sheep. Sheep are better looking. And giving my mum a bottle! -I thought it would break the ice. -She's got a problem, right? -Won't do it next time. -Like there's gonna be one. What're you doing now? Here. Take one of these. -Why? -So you'll come up when we get to the club. I don't want to go to a club. Take it anyway. Put you in a better mood. (BREAK AND ENTER BY PRODIGY PLAYING) Hey, what's up? You having a bad one? Don't! It happens. Just gotta hang on in there. I don't feel good! You're fine. Can you turn the music off? It's gone. -Are you cross with me? -No. 'Course not. Honest. Not at all. -You promise? -Yeah, absolutely. Why don't I believe you? 'Cause you're being paranoid. It's a common thing, really. All you gotta do is hang on to what's real. Try and keep it together. Think about stuff that makes you feel good. Look, can you stop talking? You're freaking me out! I'll go and make a cup of tea. No, wait! Don't leave me on my own. I'm here, I'm here. Want me to stay, yeah? No, I don't want that either. Sure you're gonna be okay? Fine, honest. -Yeah? -Really. Don't look so good yourself. No, well... Just did a bit of whizz. Starting early. You'll be late. -Sarah... -What? Can I have a hug? Hey. I'm worried about you. No need. Keep your tongue out. Do my best. I'm gone. -Tom! -Yeah? Thanks for looking after me last night. No worries. Later for you. (CAR ALARM BLARING) All right? Thought we said half past. I'm sorry. It won't happen again. Too right! I've got to be someplace. You'll have to make a drop for me. Oh, great. From Dez? -Yeah. Hi. -Round here. Come on, then, give us it! Money first. Oh, Christ! -Not now, prick! -I've gotta count it. -It's all there. Give us the gear! -Oi, tart, come here. Oh, piss! Are you dealing? -Are you dealing, you little slag? -I wasn't... I don't like dealers, especially when they're not working for me. I find, uh, a disrespect there. -I'm sorry. -It's too late for that now. You shouldn't have fucked with me. -Please don't hurt me! -What, you begging? -I swear it's my first... -You wanna beg, you gotta do it proper. On your knees. Your knees! Please! You disgust me. Where's your dignity, eh? You lost your pride, gave it away. You got to fight for yourself, you understand? Retaliate first. I want you to show me some respect. Get fucked! Good girl! Bit of conviction. I'm warming to you. (SPANNER CLATTERS) Now, I'm gonna let you off this time. But you come round here again, you're gonna get hurt. (DOOR BUZZER SOUNDING) (POUNDING ON DOOR) SARAH: Oi! What happened to you? Might have warned me about the psycho Zen Master on the loose. Ah. You met Ray, then. You know him? Yeah. He got the money, I suppose? No, I've still got it. And the drugs, as it happens. You're better at this than I am! MAN: (ON TV) Baby meerkats are usually born in litters of four. For the next few months, the whole team will take care... In a party mood, then, eh? Tom? I lost my job. I wondered when you'd tell me. You knew? Went to look for you and met your friend Donna. Nice person. -Liked her. -Why didn't you say anything? -Why didn't you? -You should've said, Tom! You should have bloody said something. I didn't want a scene. You let me get up every morning, walk out of here and get involved in shit you would not believe. So it's my fault? You let me lie to you! Yeah, that's right, blame me. I'm not blaming you. All I'm saying is, it's not that easy for everyone, right? It just gets hard. I'm tired all the time, I feel like shit. Feel I'm lettin' you down? -I just... -Look. I got no responsibility towards you, Sarah. You what? I've got nothin' resting on me, nothin'. I'm perfectly comfortable with that. What about us? We're all right. I just think we should hang out straight sometimes, is all. I'm straight when I work. You can come round the shop. There's always people there. Wherever you go... So what? I like being part of something. Well, who doesn't? -I'm not having this, Sarah. -Just listen to me! I told you I didn't want a row, I told you. All right. So let's calm down, yes? -Sorry. -Forget it. (SURGESTIVE BY ADVANCES PLAYING) I gotta go pee. What? I gotta go pee. I just wanna say, everything's gonna be okay. I know it's gonna be okay, yeah? I can't hear you! It's all gonna be okay. I'll see you in a sec, yeah? -Hello, gorgeous! -All right, Dez? What are you on tonight? -Me? I've done it all. -I can tell. -How about you? How are you doing? Sweet as, yeah? -Yeah. You got a hug for the man who made it all possible? There you go! That's nice, innit? Isn't that nice? You like that? -I can't breathe. -That's all right, just relax. Just being affectionate, that's all. Just a little bit of affection. -That's allowed, innit? -Dez! That's allowed? A little bit of affection. -Dez! -What? -I particularly like... -Get off me! Don't! Don't! I won't tell if you won't. -Get off me! -What? What? -Back off! -I'll teach you how to come on E. Somebody help me! -I know you want it, darling. -Fucking get off me! What's going on? -Christ! -Get out! I said, what's going on? -She was all over me, man. -Bastard! Easy! Look, I'm trying to keep a fucking lid on this. -Get out! -Don't push me. -What? -You heard. What're you gonna do? Gonna have a go, are you? -I might. -You might! I'm tremblin' all over! Go on, then! Go on, then! Lamp me, cocksucker! You wanna wake up to yourself, Dez, mate. What did you call me? I'm not your mate! You make me puke. You think we're all one big, happy family, do you? Yeah? You think I'd hang out with wankers like you if I didn't have to? You're business, that's all. Money in the bank, all of you. See, I know the score, man. I know what's going on. This poncy scene's fallin' apart. And I tell you, when the shit comes down, you better make sure you're wearing a fucking helmet! (SNIFFLES) He's lost the plot, eh? Yeah. Horrible thing. I don't know what to say. Can we just go, please? Already? I don't want to be here! No, 'course not, 'course not. We should tell the others, though. They won't mind. No, all the same. Look, how's this. I'll put you in a cab. I'll sort it out with them and I'll come on in a bit. You wanna go back in, don't you? Not for long. I just... -You're all mental. -Oh, yeah, you're not? Sussed like Solomon, you are. Really in control. Look, I'm sorry, Sarah. -Want me to come with, then? -And leave all this? (TELEPHONE RINGING) Yeah? Karen? I've just got in. What is it? What's wrong? Karen! Karen, it's me! -Where is she? -She's cooking. What? (CHOPPING) -Jesus, Mum! -So you saw fit to turn up, did you? -What are you doing? -I'm cooking a meal. A meal for all my family. Christ, she's bleeding. -No, Mum! -Don't say anything. Your father'll be home soon. Everything has to be ready for when your father comes home. -You're fucked in the head. -Karen! You're gonna help or not? Because if not, you can clear out of the kitchen. Yeah, we'll help. Good. Well, it's about time someone did. Just give me the knife, Mum. -Leave me alone! -Mum, just put the knife down. I've got to finish before he's home. Easy! -Hold on a sec! -Ready... -Wait a sec. -Steady... -Wait... -Go! Result, mate! It's always me, innit. God, I'm a loser. Sod it, have one anyway. We're gonna get gone tonight. I'll have another, and all. That's what the doctor ordered, boy. Lucky Dez 1 still loves us, eh? -(TELEPHONE RINGS) -Who's that? If it's Sarah, tell her to get a move on. -SARAH: Tom? -Hello? Didn't you get my note? Come again? Look, I'm sorry to ask you this, but I really need your help now. -I've got no one else. -Sarah... It's my mum. She's kind of freaked. -You've gotta get round here. -Now? She's in real trouble, Tom. Just tell me you'll come. Uh... Of course, yeah... I'll just... Thanks. -Hey, it's gonna be okay. -Who'd you call? -Tom. -Great! He's coming round. He'll sort it. It'll be all right, now. He's on his way. Cheers. Where we going, anyway? Oh, yeah. Uh... I had it written down, so... It's the kind of thing I wouldn't...develop. I've actually been there before, but, um... It's number... Number... Fuck it! (CHUCKLES) TOM: Probably no big deal. All the same, someone must know where it is. Follow that car. Years, I've wanted someone to say that! Why are you looking at me like that? I'm not. I know exactly what you think of me and don't think I don't. I know! And you! The way you look at me... You're supposed to treat me with respect. Why don't you... Why does no one... You're my own family. Checking for bottles... -Running me down. -Where you belong. This isn't doing any good. Well, what would you know? You left! One day, I woke up and you just weren't here any more. You just ran from me. You'll take her soon. -You'll take her away, too. -I'm here now. No one ever stays, no one sees things through. There's no help any more. That's not true. This is burning. It's all ruined! Look what you've done! Stop blaming! You got to face up to it. You've ruined everything. It's all your fault! You're not supposed to say that. You're supposed to humour the drunk. Don't tell her what she knows already. Don't tell her what she's trying to hide. You're supposed to be a shield. A shield. Otherwise, what have I got left? KAREN: No! TOM: Sometimes I wish it was just me, you know? It's like, there's so much stuff to deal with, people expect... Maybe they're right to give me grief. Maybe. But they should know better. Seems weird... It never comes as a surprise to me when I fuck up. Crazy. Pressure, you know what I mean? I always thought you just gotta do your own thing. Do your own thing, and hope it's enough. I've lost the car we were following. Where do we go now? Sorry? Where do you want me to take you? Home, just take me home. Gone too far this time, haven't I? No, not at all. Best night of my life! (SONG OF LIFE BY LEFTFIELD PLAYING) Piece of shit! Piece of shit! Ugh... -What are you doing here? -Lay off. I fucking begged you to come! Don't get shirty, please, love. I did my best. Look, how did you find me, anyway? Danny was at the flat. You could have at least been there, you prick! We waited, but it was Andy's thing. Cocker dragged me, he wouldn't take no. -Great! -Look, did you, um... -Did you sort out... Whatever? -Fuck you care! -Hang on! -Can you keep the noise down, please? -Trying to chill, here. -You can fuck off, and all! Fair enough. Fair enough. Do you have any idea... (SCOFFS) Oh, you're laughing! Look, I'm sorry, it's just... You shout so loud! I mean, respect! What are you on? You name it. It's been a long night. London's pretty cool, innit? I love it here. I love what I'm doing. I love who I'm doing it with. I don't envy no one, no one! It's just a rush, you know? Not always. Can be. Lighten up. Of course it can. Look, what do you want me to say? I know you're upset. -You let me down. -I always will. Don't say it like you're proud. I'm not, but I've always been clear with you. Always. I've never lied to you. You should have known what you were getting. If you'd have come when I asked... You'd have dumped on me some more. You think I run away from shit? Jesus, Sarah. Compared to you, I'm standing still. Look. Whatever's going on at home, if you want to make it your problem, you're the one that's got to deal with it, not me. My mum slit her wrists. Oh, Christ! Oh, Sarah! It's okay. It's okay, yeah? She's gonna be all right? We'll be okay, then. Oh, don't cry, Sarah. I can't bear to see you cry. You're too beautiful for that. Gently. That's the way. Let's get out of here, eh? I'm going home. What? -Tom... -No, no, don't tell me. (STAMMERING) You can't! I've got no choice. That's not true. There's always a choice. If you move out now, you won't come back, and your life there is shit, Sarah! It's drudge and it's duty. I'm all they've got. Don't martyr yourself. Please! There's no need to break up, there's no call for that. You'll be all right, Tom. Look, I don't wanna... -...be hurt. -I know. I should never have let you in! I should've kept things simple. There's no shame in that. Look around. You notice anything? I'm not alone in this, Sarah. Everybody's happy nowadays. It's not enough for you. Do you remember our first night, Sarah? We were so wild! You gonna throw all that away? Well, what else can I do? You can come back with me now. Come back to the flat. I'll fake an orgasm. (WEAK LAUGHTER) (STAMMERING) Well... What do you say? Please! Feel like having a dance? Eh? Feel like dancing? Come on! Oh, come on! Dance with me! You're doing my head in! No, no, Sarah! Sarah!
