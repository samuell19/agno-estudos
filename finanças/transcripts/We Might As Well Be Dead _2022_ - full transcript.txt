Have you noticed any physical or mental changes in the past two weeks? Such as fever, cough, dizziness, diarrhoea or paralysis, hallucinations, depression, lethargy or suicidal thoughts? - No. - No. Have you ever been evicted from a household for anti-social, immoral or inconsiderate behaviour? - No. - No. All rooms are equipped with smoke detectors. The additional documents for our application including documentation on our social commitment, including references. My wife is very committed to community work. That sounds wonderful. I'm sure you're often asked this, but? could you put in a good word for us with the selection committee? I mean, a decisively good word? Trust me, I don't take this lightly. I'd like to just look into your faces and trust you, but I'm not allowed to, I don't know why. But my face reflects the way I am. All our faces reflect our true selves. Mr Richards, look at it this way? Not only do you have to be right for us, we also have to be right for you. - How long have you lived here? - Six years. - Are you a mother? - Yes. Then you'll remember what it's like to raise a child out there. Mr Richards, please. Mr Richards, stand up. We are likeable neighbours. Likeable! We smile. We joke. We water the flowers. We always congratulate people. We abide strictly by the house rules and respect the curfews. We don't smoke. We drink only on special occasions, from small glasses. During sex, we are very quiet and discreet. We will blend in seamlessly. Please, Mr Richards. Look at him. He deserves to grow up in this building. You will stand up now, calm down, and then we will all pretend you didn't get down on your knees. The kitchen? I look forward to seeing Iris on stage. Is she better? Thank you, yes. She's very excited too. - How is your grandchild? - Very well. Five weeks old, screams all day. He doesn't know how lucky he is. "Glowing countenance of comfort." "Waking in the darkness of my basement, I peer outside. "The forest lurks, but above it waits my uncanny friend? "The moon. "Glowing countenance of comfort." Good morning? That was nice. I'll take one. They seemed very concerned about keeping everything under control. The boy was rather lively, but was gently called to order. That was a plus. Overall, they seemed tense. But we have to allow for the anxiety that comes with an interview situation. Is this velvet? Mr Richards offers himself as a physiotherapist and Ms Richards as an interior designer. The whole family is very active in sports. That might be a good fit for us. Doesn't Mr Richards look a bit sad? But that's a proper smile. Yes, but look at the eyes. That's all very well. Anna, would you want them as neighbours on your floor? We should consider all aspects of this application. This goes beyond my subjective impression. Well, I'd rather rely on your gut feeling, Anna. Mr Richards was very determined at the end. - He seemed desperate. - Understandable. But surely applying to live with us is not a time for despair. Despite everything. If we bring in people who bury their heads in the sand or cannot control their emotions, we will soon have the very conditions that these people are fleeing from when they come here. Yes? All in favour of accepting the Richards into our wonderful home? Well, I'm against it. Dear house community, it is 6 p.m. Preparations for our annual St Phoebus Day concert are in full swing. You can look forward to a varied program. From the Phoebus Boys to the Irish Dancers and the Chapel of Peace to our house choir? everyone will be there. So get yourselves ready and see you soon. It's going to be great fun. It's going to be great fun. Please don't forget to check the stove and taps as you leave and unplug any unused appliances, thank you. I'll hand over to my colleague Nicole with the weekly contact ads. For me? Don't you like them? I do. Put them on. Stylish. How do I look? No handbag? Are you ready? We've got to go. You don't need to be nervous. You're so well prepared. I'm not nervous. I'm so proud of you. I can't. Iris? You promised you'd come out to perform. I'll count to three. One, two, three. My dear friends, I think I speak for everyone when I say how grateful we are to belong to a community like ours in a world like this. As long as we are aware of this, and remain vigilant, we will, dear friends, have nothing to fear. So chin up, dear people. Let us remember Saint Phoebus and enjoy the evening. And let us not be sad about "Elysium" unfortunately being cancelled due to a case of illness. That's disappointing. Please give a big round of applause to the Irish Dancers of St Phoebus. Have you? Have you seen him? No? Have you seen him? Damn it! You know you can only get drunk in your apartment. Have you seen him? Have you seen him? Have you? I know for a fact that it was one of you! And I tell you, I will find him! Pull yourself together. Please? No, I'm? I'm sorry. I'm really sorry. I got carried away? Please, I'm so afraid of the dark. You know how we deal with defamers and troublemakers here. But it will be 11 degrees tonight. And I'm almost old. Then tonight at 11 degrees you can think about how grateful you can be to have a place in our community. Please come out. Come out right now. I can't. - Where are you going? - To people who don't hide from me. - But I'm not hiding from you. - It looks that way to me. I'm going. I can't come out because I've got the evil eye. What do you mean? You know there's no such thing. I wished that Willie would be slit open, his intestines spilling out, with him dying a painful death. And then he disappeared. It's my fault he's dead. Iriska, it's not your fault. Dogs sometimes run away and often they come back. Turn the water off, please. It helps me to control the evil eye. - Have you had enough to drink? - I mean it. Do you have a temperature? Are you in pain? Are you feeling all right? - I'm not sick, and I'm not crazy. - Come here. Nothing hurts, except my back. Then maybe you should stop sleeping in the bathtub. I know what I'm doing. I have to pee. Shit. If I find Willie, will you stop this nonsense? Please, Mum. Willie! Willie! Stand up. Have you no shame? Whose idea was this? I wouldn't have expected this from you. Making fun of the suffering of others is anti-social, immoral and inconsiderate. Are you anti-social, immoral and inconsiderate? - No. - Apparently you are. Apologise. - Mr Posner, please excuse our barking. - Yes, sorry about that. I thought I was going crazy. You can come back into the building. What about the apartments? We can't just search private homes. Willie escaped, as dogs do. Eventually he'll be back. What if he's being held against his will? Good morning. Willie? Excuse me. I didn't mean to scare you. I moved because of the ants. They were swarming back there. I have nothing against ants. I am actually very fond of animals. But sometimes they? bite me when I'm asleep? and crawl into everything, even into my ears, mouth and nose. All I think about lately is ants. We don't have ants in the basement. Wait? I'll show you. I'm sure it hasn't healed yet. You should know? I don't believe the rumours that you locked Iris up. I know you'd never do such a thing. Please focus on cleaning the premises. That's what you're assigned to do, right? - Good evening. - Good evening. Is it possible that I heard barking from in there? Absolutely, yes. But if I'm not mistaken, there is no dog registered with you? Oh, I see. No, no. We're watching a wildlife documentary. About wild dogs. Very cute! But they make a terrible noise. Oh, I see. Sorry about that. Hello. Shall we move on? Hello. Iris, everyone has anti-social, immoral or inconsiderate thoughts but that doesn't mean they have the evil eye. I imagined Mr Bieler falling from his window. The one who complained when I taught his son a Yiddish song. He got stuck in the lift and went mad. I imagined a sawfish living in the plumbing, sawing everything up? the walls, the floors, the ceilings, until the whole building fell apart. I imagined being elected chairwoman. Ursel didn't accept it and we had to expel her. She begged, but no one listened to her. But with me it's different? My thoughts come true. We could sing. Saint Phoebus defeated the behemoth by singing. He was not defeated because he does not exist. It's not working. Iris. I saw a serial killer coming out of the woods. He saw the terrace of the Drescher family lit up with coloured lights. He entered and killed them all, one after another. But Mr Drescher wasn't there because he was visiting his lover and when he came home, the bright carpet was covered in blood. When he found his family dead, he felt so guilty that he climbed onto the roof and jumped. They're all dead. And no one can change it. Hey! Who's there? Stop! I'll get you! I'll get you! He was standing here? Yes, then he ran away from me in that direction. What happened? Please go inside. There's nothing to see. Could you see what he looked like? No, it was too dark. Just a shadow. He was quite short, slim. Is anything missing? Ja. The angel figurine that was standing there. - Here? - Yes, right there. I think he was holding something in his right hand. Maybe a knife. - A knife? - Are you sure? Of course not. It could well have been a gun. Do you even understand what has happened? Someone from out there broke in. We were at his mercy. I understand, but I have to gather the facts. Ha, facts! We're still alive. Yes, but we could easily be dead! Frank, please don't let your fear defeat you. Physically, at least, we are unharmed. As for the invisible wounds, we should be aware of them? and acknowledge them. You expected this, didn't you? - Frank! - Pardon? She doesn't allow her daughter out. Mr Drescher, Iris is ill. - You see? Iris is ill. - That's one way of putting it. We do hear things. Maybe you shouldn't listen to all you hear. That's easy for you to say. You're used to this from where you're from. But here it is not acceptable to be exposed like this. This is your damn responsibility. Which I have assumed. I've always taken responsibility. This is Gerti Posner, your caretaker. Today, I speak to you as your neighbour and friend whose concerns aren't acknowledged. Frank. The cut? Come along. First an innocent animal disappears. Nobody does anything. Everyone closes their hearts. We must ask ourselves, who will be next? The poor? The sick? The children? Open up. Stop the fear-mongering. I know I've broken the rules and I feel bad, but sometimes people need a wake-up call. Yes, but not like this. That's irresponsible. You need special training for the intercom. The whole alarm system runs through it. I didn't know that. What Mr Posner said is absurd, of course. I promise everything is safe and you can freely pursue your activities. But how will you ensure that such an intrusion will not happen again? The event in? The event in the Drescher family's garden will be investigated and resolved. Should we find any breaches in our system, which will not be the case, they will be eliminated. Otherwise, I would kindly ask you to let me do my job. Serpil? Serpil? Why aren't you delivering the parcels? People are staring. I'm trying to get it too. What? The evil eye. Don't you start. Then who broke into the Drescher house? Everything is like Iris said. I'm warning you. You're blocking the terms of carriage. With your back. It was not intentional. Of course not. If someone like him can move around our building, I want a security lock. Gerti, please. Wolfram only sells his poems here. I don't move around the building, I'm only in the lift. He could get out. Every time the lift stops, you can get out. Then what? That's true. But I don't. We can consider ourselves lucky that we're all still alive. Take the stairs, then. If you feel unsafe in the lift, you always have the option of using the stairs. Is anyone else feeling unsafe in the lift? - What are you doing? - You don't need all this any more. Please stop it! Feel free to come out and stop me. Mum! Shit, bullshit, fucking shit? Don't give a shit, full of shit, you shit! Shit yourself, goddamn fucking crap! Goddamn crappy shit crap! Shit, bullshit, fucking shit, full of shit, give you shit! - Fucking crap! - I can't hear you! Goddamn piece of shitcrap! Mum? Have you noticed any physical or mental changes in the past two weeks? For example, fever, cough, dizziness, diarrhoea or paralysis, hallucinations, depression, lethargy or suicidal thoughts? No. Have you ever been evicted from a household for anti-social, Immoral, or inconsiderate behaviour? No. Have you ever been involved in such activities? That's bribery. I should disqualify you for that. Sorry. Please, we don't know what else to do. Put the money back. In your application you mention athletic interests. What are they? It's dead. - Really dead? - Absolutely. It probably cut itself and bled to death. - It could be a cut or a gunshot wound. - It's definitely not a gunshot wound. I've seen one before. He was starved. Poor thing. Gerti, that's not Willie. That's a marten. He's all haggard. His suffering changed him. - Who would do such a thing? - How can we protect ourselves? Nobody can protect themselves. Look at him. Hold on! Hold on! I can assure you all that this animal is a marten. I mean, look? Just look at it. And I'm the one who's gone mad? That's Willie! I'm quite sure nobody's implying anything. I'm well aware of what is being implied here. Let me say something. For now, we must assume that this was the same intruder who threatened the Drescher family. That's the most likely scenario. And to be safe, we have to assume we are all in danger here. We're all concerned, but panic? really isn't necessary. - Why shouldn't we panic? - No one is in danger. There's no better time to panic. Remember our fence is in very good condition. No one can just climb it. Maybe he didn't have to climb the fence. You mean, it was someone from the building? That's absurd. We have the best possible application process. Let's all calm down and keep cool heads. The incident will of course be thoroughly investigated. Until then we should refrain from speculation. What about the applicants? They've been here on their own for some time. We're just here for the flat. I beg you, let's be reasonable. This is a marten, or a ferret, a meerkat, a jumping mouse or a giant rat, but not a dog. I'll show you. - May I? - No, leave him? The things you get up to? They said you can come back in. Come on, let's go inside. Come on. I'm an octopus. We're collecting signatures for more secure locks on apartment doors. We want the security level of armoured cars. I'm very satisfied with my lock. It is very secure, by the way. Everybody has signed. If yours is missing, it may not reflect well on you, considering recent developments. What developments? Why don't you just do it? If anything comes to mind concerning the intruder, you must tell us. Since the building can't protect us, we will now protect the building. - Good day. - Hello. Sign here, please. To close our ranks, it was unanimously decided that every resident must re-apply for a place in St Phoebus House. Exceptions for native-born residents and those who have lived here more than 15 years. You cannot do this. While the perpetrator isn't caught, we must ensure everyone feels safe. - What if there is no perpetrator? - There is always a perpetrator. If not, we'll keep going until no one is afraid any more. Feeling safe is just as important as safety itself. I can't believe I need to explain this. You can leave the keys for the empty flats on the table. Did you think we'd let you carry on as before after your little performance? I was just trying to give clarity, reason. That was a rodent, not Willie. I vouched for you guys back then. Not everybody wanted you here. I won't name names, but many? were worried? about whether you'd settle in, because of the language and cultural differences. I persuaded them, with the weight of my authority, and reminded them that Phoebus House has been and always will be a place for an open, multicultural community. And how do I look now? Consider your re-application as a way to clear the air and get a fresh start. Your voice would be wasted out there. I'm sorry. I am sure you will pass. I will be voting for you. Be careful, the stairs are wet. - You might slip. - I'll hold on to the rail. If you're asked, could you say I am an excellent, reliable resident? Accurate and clean and also very charming. I'll say whatever you want about you. Iris Wilczynska, we are pleased to have you with us today. The pleasure is all mine. We would like to understand what exactly makes you an? indispensable part of our community. Thank you for that question. I'm the principal voice in the St Phoebus choir. Given its long tradition, I see it as an honour and a duty to always give my best, which I do. Also in my sports classes rhythmic gymnastics, water polo and in the astronomy club I took the best picture of Mars. You can even see the mountains. I think people appreciate my helpfulness and enthusiasm. Enthusiasm. That can easily go too far. I am always very careful. Were you ever evicted from a household for anti-social, immoral, or inconsiderate behaviour? No. Have you ever been involved in such activities? Not exactly activities, but I have this effect? - Thank you, that's enough. - I can't lie. I know. I've been thinking it over. I've had time to think long and? to think hard? about what makes a good neighbour and I? Mr Sch?tzendorf, please resume your position and make a nice straight jab? and stop. - With oomph, please! - What is oomph? He would have already killed you. If you want to be really effective, use a knifehand strike to the neck. Go ahead. What are you doing? I'm making myself indispensable. You should do the same. We must do something instead of stirring things up. You always want to do something, but? Thank you! Don't you see where this is going? But nothing happened. Have you ever considered that you might be wrong? I have to keep working. Please leave. We are coming to the most important exercise of all. Stop! - Stop! - Louder! They are for playing golf. - Really? - Really. We're not in the mood to play golf. Then give me the clubs, please. She wants us to give her the clubs. I'm still here. Yes, still. Come? Look at me. Look at me! You don't need to be to be afraid. I won't let anything happen to you. Why on earth did you climb over the fence? Come in. After you. Please sit down. He's asleep now. Such a daredevil, our boy. May I? - Here you are. - Thank you. That's nice. That old thing. Do you want it? Oh, no, thank you. Please take it. We always order way too much stuff. - Will you help her take it upstairs? - Of course. Any time. If there's anything else I can do for you, just let us know. Why don't you let me check on Iris's recovery? That's not necessary. You have enough to do. - Please don't object. It's my pleasure. - No, no. Really, no need. It might even be unsettling for her. We very much hope that Iris recovers soon. I'm sure she'll be fine soon. Maybe I'm being a little over-cautious. How about we use our first names? Gladly. Frank. Erika. Frank. A gift from Frank and Erika. They're alive? Thank God. What if you imagined how, instead of the serial killer, you went to visit the Dreschers? To kill them? No. Because they invited you. Of course they would. They invited us today. - Just like that? - Just like that. For a barbecue. Because they like us. But you don't even like barbecues. Maybe that's changing. Dear house community, it's 10 o'clock. The outside temperature is 19 degrees. The chance of precipitation is 12 percent. On behalf of the management, I wish you a good day. It's really nice outside. You can pursue all outdoor activities without hesitation. The sun will do you good. Would you kindly take out my garbage when you go on patrol? You can go outside. Everything is safe. Word of honour. I don't feel very well. A cold. Thank you. Very kind of you, thank you. Good morning. Thanks, I already cleaned them last week. Better safe than sorry. Come with me, please. Please come with me. Tell the committee what an outstanding job Ms Stamm is doing. Outstanding. May I come in for a moment, please? I hope the serial killer comes soon. I don't understand what you mean. "Mr Drescher was not there because he was visiting his lover. "When he got home, the bright carpet was covered in blood." Come on, I'll take you home. Mum is at home? with Mr Drescher. Are you sure? Wait! Take this for protection. From the serial killer. There is no serial killer. Stay here. Wolfram? Excuse me. A little clumsiness. What is that on your face? It doesn't hurt at all. I slipped and fell. I'm going to take a break now. A break might also be good for business. It might increase demand. Mum, you're hurt. What happened? Iris? If I come out, we're all doomed. Can you imagine the committee all jumping off the roof in a case of mass hysteria? Then all problems would be solved. Have you been fighting with your mother lately? - What is this? - I'm trying to help. - But you're not. - How else would you explain this? What about Serpil? How can she be happy if you keep bringing men home and breaking up families? I'm building a social network here to protect myself and my daughter. Exactly the opposite of what you're doing. - Serpil, let's go. - I don't want to. Out now! We're leaving! I tried to get it too, but it won't work. Wait. Zeynep! Zeynep! Zeynep! Mum? I'm going to kill you, you pig! Good evening. I feel much better, thank you. I just wanted to check on things. Will you put in a good word for me? With the re-application? You're too old for this. Mum, please. Not so rough, please. - It's not rough. - Ouch. - Will you come out for your birthday? - No. Or at Hanukkah? I don't know. - Or when you retire? - Mum? Or when I drop dead? Stop it! What are you doing? You're hurting me. Please stop. No. Don't! I am innocent! I'm just a poet! I'm innocent! Please! No, no! What is this? Angel. What is it? An angel! That you stole! I didn't! I'm an atheist. What would I do with it? Why would I steal an angel when I'm trying to be invisible? Ms Wilczynska, you? You know me a little. That's enough, Wolfram. Once someone crosses such line, we no longer know where he stands. Who he even is. It's me. Your Wolfram. I live in the basement. I wash myself outside with the garden hose. I sell my poetry books in the lift. Otherwise, I'm in the basement. I don't participate in recreational activities. In a way, I don't appear. That's why you may not know me so well. But you must believe me, I don't steal. Especially not decorative angels. Let's not get lost in unnecessary speculation. The so-called poet and pest controller Wolfram Mantel, residing in the basement, section 52, is charged with trespass, burglary and theft. There is reasonable suspicion. It can therefore be assumed that Wolfram Mantel is a burglar and it can further be assumed that he is also the intruder and Willie's murderer. It naturally follows that Wolfram Mantel is to be regarded as the murderer. In the absence of evidence to the contrary, the committee orders his expulsion. This allows you 20 minutes to get outside our main fence. No, please! - What happened? - Nothing. Nothing? We're safe. - Really? - Yes. - We don't have to leave? - As I said, we're not going anywhere. Dear St Phoebus community, it's a beautiful day here and also out in the compound. How about a round of golf? No need to hold back. Everything is safe. What are you doing? I'm taking these people to their evaluation. They needed some encouragement. Who initiated this? The perpetrator was caught and expelled. Everything is as it was. We are of a different opinion. Everything is yet to be as it was and so we are acting as planned. What are we waiting for? Right. Sleep, my little bird, close your eyes? Sleep well, my child, sleep and be healthy? Sleep and dream sweetly of the beauty of the world? As long as you are young, you can sleep easily and laugh about everything? As long as you are young, you can sleep easily and laugh about everything? What's happening? What are you doing? Let go of me! No. Stop it! What are you doing, Mum? Let go of me! No! Let go. Mum! Let go of me! Get out! No! Open up! Everything is all right! Good night! Then why was there shouting? Nobody was shouting here. Sleep well. Sorry to disturb you. It's the middle of the night. Hold on, I'm coming. Ursel! You brought everyone. Yes, we stick together. And we don't forget anyone either. - Will you move aside, please? - No. Anna! I honestly don't recognise you any more, and I'm not the only one who feels this way. We belong here. With you. One could even think we were born here. All right. Let's move on to the vote. Who is in favour of Ms Wilczynska leaving the apartment? For six years I've taken care of security here. It appears we are all still alive and unharmed. - And Willie doesn't count? - Willie is a dog. Stay where you are. Iris! She has the evil eye. If you leave us alone, you will be spared. - That's not true. - I wouldn't risk it. Your retina will peel off, you will go blind, then accidentally poison yourself. You'll lose your sense of smell. You won't smell the gas. You'll be torn apart by the explosion. You'll be in the wrong place at the wrong time. That's enough! Your teeth will be like chalk. They'll slowly rot. One night you'll choke on the crumbs. Subtitles: SBS Australia 2023
