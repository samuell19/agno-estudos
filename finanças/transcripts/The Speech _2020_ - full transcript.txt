Good evening. Les Films sur Mesure present Benjamin Lavernhe of the Comédie-Française, Sara Giraudeau, Julia Piaton, Kyan Khojandi, Guilaine Londez and François Morel in... "THE SPEECH". Based on Fabrice Caro's book published by Gallimard, produced by Olivia Lagache, written and directed by Laurent Tirard. Thank you for your patience. Enjoy the movie. In December 1980, at a concert in Los Angeles, announced Darby Crash, lead singer of The Germs that he intended to commit suicide. A few days later, he put his money where his mouth is. He administered himself a fatal amount of heroin. Darby Crash had hoped his name would reverberate in rock history. What he couldn't know is that John Lennon would be killed that same day which overshadowed his death and he fell into oblivion. This story is pretty much how I see life. Whatever you do, you are never in control. A month ago, Sonia said to me... I need a break. A what? - A break. I need a break. Are you tired? Do you want to rest? No, Adrian. I need a break. - In what sense? In connection with you. And us. Do you want to break up? I did not say that. I said I need a break. What is the difference? - A pause is like a pause button. Push it and you stop. Push again and you continue. Breaking up is "stopping". No introduction, no explanation? Yes. - In real life there are no breaks. New? - New! You don't get up to leave dinner for a break. You lie if you have to, but you explain. It's about respect. Good. Out of curiosity, how long does a break last? 38 days. For 38 days I think about our relationship and try to figure out why Sonia wanted a break. I knew three phases. defeat. Fury. Damn! Why? Heap. Oh yes, and despair. And wallow in despair too. In short, five phases. I swore I wouldn't contact her. Today at 5:24 PM... I admitted. Hi, Sonia, I hope you're doing well! Hugs & kisses. At 6.56 pm I saw that she had read my message. I was very happy. She read my message. Everything was possible again. But now it's 8:07 PM and she hasn't replied yet. The pinnacle is that I'm stuck at a family dinner talking about... Underfloor heating. Does it cost more or less? The installation costs more, but afterwards it is cheaper. How does it work? There are two systems: electric and hydraulic. And a third is in development. An hour and eleven minutes and still no answer. What could be the explanation for that? Maybe she was driving when she got the message. And she wanted to answer but then... Nothing bad. Lucky. Some bruises... We're going to do a scan, but you're fine. She wants to call me. Can I have my phone? But the nurse, a tall blond German, says... Not now. In the meantime I wait. In the summer you can use cold water for cooling. Does it do both? Interesting. What do you think, Adrian? What do I think? Real? You're asking my opinion when I sent a message at 5:24 PM and it still hasn't been answered? Come on. Would you ask earthquake victims in Haiti what they think about underfloor heating? Or to Kurdish refugees in Calais? New. Then leave me alone. I would like to answer in such a way. But in my family that is not possible. This is the Kingdom of the Unspoken Things and the Respectful Consensus. In short, the empty relationships. In the kitchen there is a towel hanger I made in sixth grade. It was a technology project. Towel hangers for Christmas for our parents. I wasn't particularly talented at handicrafts and quickly lost control. Next one. Very nice. What should have been a tree turned into a rather unexpected shape. Well done. On December 25, I gave my mother... a wooden penis. Very nice! Thanks sweetheart. I'm going to... hang there. She hung it up immediately making my teenage years became a long period of shame. Adrian made it. Such denial makes you powerless. What do you think, Adrian? Yes, it's not bad. Everyone has a specific role. My mother starts the conversations based on platitudes. The warming is disturbing. My sister takes over and takes everything on herself. We are going on holiday in Brittany. So no heat wave for us. My future brother-in-law Ludo displays his knowledge. The problem is that the meltwater is disrupting the Gulf Stream. And my father closes with an unimportant anecdote. I remember a year that it rained all summer and that I was doing crosswords. I had never made one. I used a fountain pen that Aunt Germaine had given me. Or maybe my godfather. One of the two. My role is to be present and to make vague comments. What do you think, Adrian? It's disturbing. The next dish. Don't touch it, I'm not done yet! The rest of the dinner, including the inevitable yogurt cake, contains no surprises. Say, your sister would love it if you gave a speech at the wedding. Excuse me, what? - A speech. A speech. Do you want me to give a speech? - Yes. I didn't see that coming. It has been 3 months since they announced their marriage. For 3 months I have mentally prepared myself for the nightmare. The town hall... the church... the aperitif... the dinner... And worst of all, the polonaise. Because no one escapes the polonaise. You can pretend you eat, make phone calls. Forget it. The polonaise is merciless. Impossible, I eat. I eat. I'm on the phone! It is a machine that crushes egos. No I do not want. Help me! I do not want! Yes, we hear you. But when you think there's nothing worse your future brother-in-law whispers in your ear... She would love it if you did the speech. Nothing special. A few words. Yes, but... - Thanks, I'm counting on you. I can not do it. I cannot speak in public. You know what? It leaves me cold. I'm doing something classic... a list. Yes. Some keywords: "childhood", "the time that passes," "life as a couple". That will stop the pats on the back. I hate that. I make a list. Lists are great. I made one for my first date with Sonia. I was as stressed as I was for an oral exam. The chance of silence in the conversation petrified me. For me, every silence stood for a first date equivalent to "a fiasco." It meant it didn't click. It would never work, you were wrong. So I made a theme list to restart the conversation. It was something along the lines of... "Do you love your job?" "Already been to the Camargue?" "Prefer sweet or savory?" "Beyoncé is great, isn't it?" Day. - Day. I'm late. No problem. - Something funny happened to me. The conversation started naturally. We talked for hours, naturally and relaxed. I was 13. - Did you run away when you were 13? I was precocious and rebelled. It was hard at home. And I packed some things. But you got back to it. - No not really. What held me back... I can't tell you. - Come on, say it! You know how we feel about our view at that age? I was afraid my parents would use an ugly photo to look for me. A worthless rebel! No why? Very quickly I thought "it's her". "She" what? I didn't know, but it was her. I was charmed. Her literary culture was extraordinary. Pessoa's book of restlessness? Der Man ohne Eigenschaften of Musil? Tender is the Night by Fitzgerald is a must. The last Harry Potter? - Yes! A joke. - Of course. I was also kidding. I'm going to forget the titles. - I write them down. My handwriting is terrible... I can make up a lie and tell you that making lists is my hobby. But the truth is that I was impressed and afraid I couldn't say anything. So I made a list of topics. It's mind-boggling, yes. I will write on the other side. Adrian? Shall I serve you? Do you like bell peppers? I always forget. No, Sophie. I don't like peppers. It always has been. You don't know my taste. It leaves you cold. Do you know what she gives me on my birthday? An encyclopedia. From age 8 to age 35, one encyclopedia a year. That's 27 encyclopedias. Happy Birthday brother. And every time... You are easy. Always happy with a book. My friends already thought I collected them. Happy Birthday! And they started it too. French wine, beer, bread, inventions, hunting, chocolate... Outer space, the Middle Ages. When the internet came along, I thought it would stop. Everything was digital. One click was enough to find everything. But no. Here, brother. Happy Birthday. - Thank you. You are easy. Always happy with a book. A recurring joke. One that wasn't funny. Thank you. I don't understand Sophie. How can siblings know each other so poorly? We were close when we were kids. What happened? When did we grow apart? I did not understand. What? - Paprika? No, Sophie. Thanks, no peppers. I thought so. It's idiotic. I can't remember. Yes, it's idiotic. - What about you, honey? Idiot. Good evening. It's time for the speech. Don't worry, it's a short one. I hope so anyway. To be honest, I don't often give speeches. Ludo asked me to do it. That dazzling Ludo. I say "asked," but it wasn't really a question. No, Ludo, it wasn't a question. There was no question mark... Damn it, I suddenly understand. There was no question mark in my message. What does he write? "Hello, Sonia, I hope you're doing well! Hugs & kisses." What are you going to answer? - Nothing. He hopes things are going well, but he doesn't ask. I don't have to answer. - That's right. What an idiot. Damn, what an idiot. Are you okay, Adrian? New! I put an exclamation mark, not a question mark. What? I would like to say about Sonia. About the 5:24 pm message and my despair. But that's useless. My first breakup taught me that. Isabelle belonged to the generation that was in love with Africa. It was like a virus infecting the female population. You couldn't escape it. pimples at 12 years, Africa at 19 years. What are your plans? - I'm going to Benin with pens. Pens? - I've started a collection. They have nothing there. Pens are the start of education and emancipation. A pen, please. Isabelle... Isabelle? This is for Benin. Thank you. Nice. I'm Adrien. - Thanks, Adrien. Day. Here, for Benin. - Cool, thanks. A pen, please. Isabelle. For Benin. Thank you. Here. For Benin? It's sweet of you, but I've got plenty of pens. Real? How many do you have? - Enough. Of course? - Yes. One less or more... - No. Real. Thank you. - You're welcome. Day. - Day. Excuse me. I found another one. I thought, "This one's for you." A little one from Benin. Leave me alone. What? - I said I have enough. Don't get excited. - Damn it, leave me alone! Damn! Weird guy. - It was for Benin. Benin is up for grabs! I sank into a depression. One day I confided in my mother. I want to die. I had to tell her, share my sorrow. I don't feel well, Mom. Not at all. And she said... Drink orange juice. How are you? There you go. Short, sober, efficient. Everything has been said. It means, "I am serene and calm. It wasn't easy, but I recovered. Now I'm worried about you. And I'm here for you." You like someone who says, "How are you?" do not ignore. The food goes to the second stomach, known as the "social stomach", and then it can be shared. It's extraordinary. Astonishing. Did you know that, Adrian? What? Ants. - Trophallaxis. What? - Trophallaxis. It allows the ants to share food and hormones. A social network avant la lettre. - I did not know. I will give you a book. - Awesome. Fascinating. - We'll get the rest. This is for my first stomach. Say, Ludo. As for the speech... I thought maybe you could ask someone else. I don't fit comfortably in front of an audience. You will do well, sure. Listen... - I'm listening. It's the best gift ever. Okay I... That smells good. - You can't go wrong with lamb. shit. The bastard. I failed to avoid the speech, no, they also expect him to be fantastic. I am the official bringer of the most beautiful gift. I am responsible for the success of the marriage. That's what he means. Wait, a moment. You didn't understand. I'm not going to give your speech. Does she worry about the best present for me? Have you read my encyclopedias, Ludo? The Most Beautiful Peaks of Europe, Reptiles and Frogs, Babies of the World. Calm down, man. - How so? Think. This speech may be the best thing that could happen to you. Excuse me, but... Tired of how they see you? - Yes. "Adrien lives in his dream world. He is a poet!" Stop, I hate that. "Closer" means "autistic" to them. Why not change that? Use this speech that the poet can be sociable and fascinating. Imagine... He comes and says to her: "Ma'am? I think your toe is stuck in my door." Who's hungry? What is this? One two! Eat fruits! Red Alert! Eugenie, my gosh! The maternity did you good. You look beautiful and I mean it. hi julien, Isabelle, Jean-Pierre, Corinne, Hervé, Steph... Jean-Noël! You have come! Magnificent. Beautiful haircut. Are you having fun? Jokes, anecdotes, sweet words. They love you. Jean Pierre, what is this? A scratch card! People will say... Who is that? - The bride's brother. I didn't know he was that funny. 125,000 euros! Remember, money doesn't buy happiness. Gangster. You are the best table. You go from group to group, agile, playful, mischievous, charming. Hey, little ones. Doesn't it take too long? Of course. Sybille, where's your napkin? No bickering. Who had good grades in school? Time for presents! Brush your teeth tonight. I like children. Incredible! I love you! Yes, but no. Yes, but no? - You know it won't be like this. He puts on a pout. The microphone goes slack. So... Dear Sophie, dear Ludo... I say "dear Sophie"... because according to mama it is a synonym of angelic. The bad jokes followed one another as well as the annoying silences. A beautiful dress. It's okay for that price. Dear Ludo, the word is also suitable here because marrying you is touching for my sister. The unease grows... Just kidding, I love you. Don't worry, not sexually. I'm kidding. I promised you emotions along with some funny moments. Why did everyone know that Napoleon... kept his receipts aside? Voltage! - Napoleon Bon Apart. What? - Napoleon Bon Apart. Do not say that. You messed up everything. You have to let me say it. That was not planned. Napoleon Bon Apart. There is also the one about the Chinese. I love it. Now another trick. Who is that? - The bride's brother. Why is he doing this? Is it a practical joke? Maybe he's been drinking. It's a classic, but it always works. I hurry. The scarf disappears. Attention. Bravo! One more thing... We are gone. Please don't leave. Not only will this speech plunge the family into shame, someone will film it too. Millions of internet users will laugh at me and say: "It's not real, no one is that touching." Isn't that more realistic? Yes, you are screwed. Good luck. Do you already know what Bérangère has done? Berangere? - The new on marketing. She took Wednesday off while she has no children. Yes that is... She says it was a mistake but she will pay for her "mistake". You're right, honey, be strict. - Give her an encyclopedia. Excuse me? Did you say something? I? New. Yes. Yes. Actually... I don't understand. What's the problem? Taking leave on Wednesday or having no children? You're acting strange tonight. I pose a question. How is your friend Barbara? She's okay, but a third child won't work. The poor ones. You know what? I'm going to make the speech, but I have one condition. You are no longer allowed to scratch your plate with your fork. I could kill you for it. It's funny because Sophie doesn't seem to mind. God be praised. Irritation is the first sign of trouble in a couple. One day you wake up and drive your girlfriend crazy. Can't you slurp? It's unpleasant. When did everything change? What were the first signs? One night I woke up with severe chest pain. What is it? - No idea. It looks like a stab wound. I'm having a heart attack. - A heart attack? baby. Breathe, breathe. - I'm going to die! I'm going to die! She took me to the emergency room. Judgment was passed at 4 a.m. Nothing. What do you mean? - Everything is normal. Of course? - Yes. I do not understand. Nothing. Of course? - Yes. Thats crazy. Weren't you here for malaria last week? - Malaria? Yes Yes. No, it was paludism. Paludism. - Paludism, malaria... Negative. - Neither? There is always something wrong with you. Excuse me. Sorry for the burden. If you went to Africa you would know what that is. Excuse me, Sonia... you chose the wrong example. Yes? - Yes. Real. Ever heard of Benin? When I was young, I was actively involved in the development. Yes. Have you ever donated pens? New. Don't come tell me about Africa. Okay? Have you donated pens? How much? How many pens? I do not know anymore. Maybe a dozen. No, fifteen. A dozen. - They were very happy. Hello, test. Good evening everyone. Don't worry, I'll keep it short. Because you have a very busy evening. Sophie and Ludo have secured... ensured... no, ensured... That is it. - He has drunk. For a lot of surprises including... I'm a real rascal. Am I saying it? New? I see Sophie and Ludo waving their arms. Do I say it, yes or no? Voltage! Okay, no. You are lucky. But I do have an anecdote. It's about my sister. Nothing bad, trust me. She must have been 12 or 13. One day I entered her room... to borrow a CD or something. As I looked around I came across... her diary. And then, I have to admit... I know it was wrong, but I was young and curious. I couldn't resist, I opened it. Big mistake! The first words made a huge impression. Sophie comes to me. "Benjamin: L-8, I-4, S-7." Look at that. - Stop. I wanted to decipher the mysterious code. I went through the diary quickly and I saw... People are leaving. - "Eric: L-3, I-7, S-9." You are hurting me! "Bastien: L-8, I-5, S-3." And finally I read... Be silent. - Hear yourself. I read: "November 27." Tell me if I'm wrong. "Today I looked at Pascal and he turned all red. "Looks: a 9. Intelligence: 6. Style: 8." I had my explanation. She gave points for three main criteria: Looks, Intelligence and Style. "L.I.S." Stop! There you go. So my question is: what points does she give to Ludo? Let's face it, Ludo isn't the prettiest. ah! Stop it, damn it! - It was a joke! Ludo, calm down. No, honey. Please! It was a joke! What's wrong? Calm down! I can not do it. I can't give the speech. Okay, calm down. Take a deep breath and think. What is the solution? Call off the wedding. How can that be justified? I'll get there... The tragic death of the couple. They drove home in good spirits with their quotation for underfloor heating. And between the car wash and Buffalo Grill... We couldn't do anything more. A speech at the funeral? Forget it. Perhaps... adultery a few days before the wedding. Sophie, home already? Has Ludo ever cheated on my sister? I doubt it. I wonder if he's ever noticed any other women besides my sister. Same for Sophie. For her, deception only exists in novels and TV series. When Ludo talks... you see boundless admiration in my sister. The universe would be destroyed. It's crazy. - It's terrifying. Take Pluto now... In those moments, my sister's eyes say, "Look how smart he is." He's mine. He is my lover and we are getting married. And Ludo, he often puts his hand on my sister's. Without looking at her. The hand says, "We are happy!" She says, "This moment must last forever." She says, "Honey, let's go for a walk on the beach hand in hand and talk about underfloor heating." Damn it, I have an idea. It's mean. It's all right not to have to give a speech. Say, Ludo. I wondered. Sophie... Did she ever tell you about her rating system? The "L.I.S." system? Did she tell you? - Yes. What did you think of it? - I thought it was funny. Okay. You didn't wonder... What? - Where you stood? She told me. I'm an "L-7, I-9, S-3." Hey, Sophie? - What? We were talking about the "L.I.S." system. You gave me a "3" for style. Not flattering, but now she chooses my clothes. Who started that? adrien. Why are you talking about that? Just like that. I... I'm not going. Period, I'm not going. I'll come up with something. I can do that well. Shut up, shut up. For example, I have never introduced a girlfriend to my family. Day. Bye, mom. Are you alone? She keeps looking over my shoulder in the hope that this time I brought a date. Sometimes I would drop a name in an ordinary conversation. We liked the newest Ozone very much. Have you seen him, Adrien? - Yes. I've been with Pauline. Mentioning a woman's name made my mother happy. The past 10 years was there a Chloé, Alice, Juliette, Pauline... No, two Paulines! Josephine, Sabrina and even a Marie-Myrtille. That was for fun. And every time my mother asks: "When can we meet her?" And every time I have an excuse. Did you come alone? She's stuck at work. Her grandmother passed out. Backache. Toothache. My apologies became more and more unclear. Her best friend lost her mother. Her mother lost her best friend. Are you alone? Her mother's best friend lost her best friend's mother. Terribly. And again and again my father winked with the thought: "I'm not falling for it, boy. There must be dozens of girls out there." Day. I never gave up. Are you alone? New. She was just there. Sylvie! I do not understand. I could never bring Sonia with me. Thinking about it gives me goosebumps. There would be so many languages that we would need interpreters. Like the United Nations. "The Book of Restlessnessof Pessoa?" "Do you like peppers, Sonia?" "Tender is the Night by Fitzgerald is a must." "Do you have underfloor heating, Sonia?" "The last of Harry Potter?" "I have read it." "Just kidding." The shock of their meeting would be so violent, like matter and antimatter, that everything would disintegrate. And there would be nothing more. Just nothing. Good evening. Don't worry, it won't be long. To be honest, I would like to leave. I have nothing against you, I don't even know most of them. But it's true, I'd like to run away. Before the Polonaise. Before La Compagnie Creole. Before a drunk uncle sits down next to me, unbuttons his shirt and says he knew me when I grew up, and that time flies. It's strange. Why are marriages melancholic? Sophie and Ludo will soon enter the dance floor. You will watch with a tender smile. But gradually you will become less attentive. You will be flipping through the album of your life. With failures, with remorse, and the regret that characterized your life will surface. You will look at your partner with his or her stiff smile, and drunken eyes with wine... But you will say: "Be happy with what you've got. We're not that bad off, are we, Pierrot? We are not unhappy." Even if you say that to yourself, surely you will think that it is partly because of Pierrot that your life is a failure. And from that moment on will last long. Very, very long. Enjoy the food. I forgot something. Did I tell you how I met Sonia? Day. Not dressed up? - Yes. What are you, a werewolf? Don't recognize this? Freddy Krueger? - No it is... Captain Hook? - Forget it. I brought this. What is that? - A frozen pizza. I had nothing else. I thought it was a quattro stagioni, but it's a Hawaiian and I hate pineapple. I don't want to throw it away... I'm leaving out the details. I got the details. come. Annoying guy. The bar is there. Hurry! What do I have to do with this? Day. Didn't you want to dress up too? - I'm dressed up. Yes? - Like Barbara. Who? - Barbara, the singer. Yes indeed. No, that's Dalida. - Yes. Okay. It was a joke. I'm not dressed up. I've come to say hello to Karine. I have to go somewhere else. I'm Sonia. adrien. Health, honey! Likewise. Excuse me. - Karin! Everything fine? - My nose! Damn. Are you OK? Take her to the bathroom. I stabbed her... - In the nose. My nasal septum! Keep your head back. - Not going. Like this? Karine, I'm sorry. Can I do something? Go away, idiot! Damn! I can't smell anything left. I don't smell anything. I'm telling you, I can't smell anything. One thing, the girl standing next to me... Get rid of him! Go away, idiot! Asshole! - Just her number. Karine? Yes, it's Adrian. Adrien, yes. It's a long time ago. How are you? Real? Damn. That's strange. What do the doctors say? Was your septum always sensitive? Not at all... Okay. I? You know... Did you hear about me and Sonia? Not apart, she's taking a break. A break. I know. The difference is... a pause is like a pause button. Breaking up is like "stop." You see? That's right. Anyway... Have you talked to her recently? No, today. I sent a message, but she hasn't replied. I was wondering if her phone is working. No problem if you don't know. I can't ask you... call her to ask. Imagine that. I mean, would you do it? Of course it's a joke. It was nice to hear your voice but I have to leave. I'm with my parents. Okay, no details. Alright. See you later. Be careful when sneezing. Bye. Where are you taking me? What are we doing? - You'll see. It's a Wish Tree. A what? - Look. People write their wishes on a piece of paper and stick it here to make it come true. - Funny. Sometimes I come here and read a few. What? Do you read the wishes of other people? I put them back. Why do you do that? - Out of curiosity. I try to guess what the people look like. That's stupid. - No, come on. No, I won't. - We both take one. We read them aloud and then they are our wishes. Come on. Okay, good. Me first. Choose wisely. "Look at me forever the way you looked at me last night." Your turn. Have a look. Voltage! I want Solène to let me take her in the ass. And? What does it say? Yes indeed. It says... It says... "I want... go to Rome with Solène." Yes! When I hid the wish, I knew what would happen because of my mistake. Solène, I didn't do it on purpose. You haven't done it intentionally a few times. I do not see the problem. I'll explain: I don't want it. Why not? - I do not feel like it. It's ridiculous. You studied philosophy. What is the connection? - Real? All Greek philosophers all have... I can not believe it. - It's true, baby. By the way, with your back problems.... Stop, the answer is "no". If you'd rather be in pain... - I said "no". Okay? How is this possible? How do you arrive at the statement: "Solène doesn't want to be fucked in the ass, so my only hope is a note in the Wish Tree." How does such sexual desire become a priority? "I want this damn speech... Do not give." The permafrost is a kind of eternal snow that begins to thaw. It sounds trivial, but many incurable ancient viruses could be released. We don't know what to expect. Children... I have bad news. Uncle Claude. He has cancer. - New! He told me yesterday. I didn't know what to say. - "Drink orange juice." Excuse me. - Which cancer? lung cancer. He smoked like a heretic. Two packs a day. It had to happen. Without filters! It's Sonia. It has to. What do the doctors say? - It is too early. Damn. It is unbecoming to consult my phone during my uncle's cancer. How long has he known? You know Claude, telling the truth is hard... A nasty disease. - Yes. Like my mother. - No, Ludo. You're not even going to start. She became unwell... - Not your mother, not now! I thought it was a harmless melanoma. - It's a conspiracy. Are you going to talk about every person with cancer? One day you live to the fullest. And then you take a turn... We can talk about your mother in 15 minutes. A quarter of an hour. I will be attentive, cordial, overwhelmed and philosophical. I beg you, let me check my messages. It was tough. We were all shocked. The hospital system... I know! I'm going to grab my phone and pretend I'm looking for relevant info... "I wonder how many people die each year from cancer." But if the message is from Sonia, I won't be able to hide my response. It doesn't make us happy. Treatments, home nurses, chemotherapy... Visit that doesn't know what to say and anyone who is pretending. Cobalt-64... - It's terrible. That's life. Anyone for some gratin? Gladly. - Yes? Thank you. Do you have my Daft Punk LP? Sebastien. It is a joke. Incredible. Why is he bothering me with his stupid LP? How can he do this to me? Especially Sebastien. He knows exactly how I feel. A year ago, he was dumped by Chloé. It doesn't have to go like this. You can take a break. A break? Yes of course. He was endearing for the next few months. He was possessed by his own tragedy and told the whole world that his relationship was over. To drink something? Yes, my relationship is over. Have you seen the last film of the Coen brothers? No, my relationship is over. Do you know what time it is? No, my relationship just ended. New! My relationship just ended! Say it to everyone! My relationship is over. "Why are you attacking me... difficult... with your lp? I don't even have a record player... idiot." Sent by mistake. A classic, but it always works. I write... "No, Sebastien, I'm sorry... I don't have your Daft Punk LP, you idiot." And I send the message "by mistake" to Sonia. I'll wait a little while. And then I write, "Oops, sorry, mistake!" I'll add a smiley. "Wink, I was wrong!" Behold! She will realize that she never answered "How are you?" and she will answer something. And when she says I'm bothering her, I say, "No, it was a mistake!" She will probably answer right away. Yes I know. But in my condition, you grab every straw. So... Leo... Here, "Love". "A star." One star of how many? Four! "You feel hurt. When betrayed, a Leo runs away." Who wrote that nonsense? Ange Rigel. Look at the smile. He gives me one star, says I give up and smiles? No, Ange Rigel! Where did you get that theory? When a Leo is betrayed, he goes through 3 phases. Sadness, anger, hope. Despair too... no, forget that. Do your homework. Why only one star? Was two too hard? Do you think it would have given people courage? I do not think so. Aquarius. What did you give her? Four stars. Four stars for Love? do you want me dead? "Lots of lovely people... If you're single, this might be your chance." Who are those lovely people? Leave her alone. Leave her alone! Write that in your horoscope. Come on, write! Write! Whatever your sign is, you should not be sweet with single women who are Aquarius. They need to fix something..." Faster! "...write a message and restart a relationship. Don't dream of approaching them, especially the sweet person she might notice." I've been suspecting the break has a first name for a while now. And I think that first name is... Romain. It was at a housewarming. A relaxed evening. And suddenly, without warning... He started to play, very casually. His stare said, "Don't mind me. I'm an attractive melancholy guy with old wounds which I try to heal with art and poetry." The whole room was watching him. Especially the women. Their eyes said, "He is profound and sensitive. His intense gaze should be on me and not on his inner demons." You can play a minor and d minor at a party with married couples. It is banned by the Geneva Convention! New. That was beautiful. Classical guitar? - No, a folk guitar. Is it a hobby or are you a professional musician? I am a musician. Hi. Excuse me. I was wondering, do you do demonstrations in schools? Do you work for the Ministry of Education? No, I mean yes. I am a school teacher. Which degree? First grade. The following week everything went very quickly. He gave demonstrations in her class once a week. And gradually "Romain" became a part of our daily life. How are you? Good and how are you? - Great, the kids love Romain. You worked late. After class I went for a drink with Romain. Romain gave me a Nick Drake album. Surprise, surprise! I'm having nighttime seizures again. Damn! One day she stopped saying his name and it was even worse. How are you? - Good and how are you? Is there any news? No, I'm exhausted. I am going to bed. Her silence reeked of Romain. The less she said, the more he was present. Everywhere, all the time. It's decided. If she hasn't answered by dessert yet... If I have no news when my mother put down her yogurt cake... I call her. - I met Jean-Luc's mother. He bought a nice house in... - It's beautiful. Where is it? - In the Vendée. Indeed. - Funny. Damn it, I hope he doesn't start with, "I remember..." I remember... I was there once. My father's anecdotes are like a labyrinth. You enter through "I remember". Then you are on the road for hours thanks to his overconfident digressions. The only certainty is that the story will end with the moment I puked on a hitchhiker. But before we get there, there is a long way to go. A very long one. It was just before my military service. It is there that I met my best friends. You still have them. - Correct. It was different then. The girls were bolder, not so shy. It was for "Me-Too-Sell-You-Recommended." "Assailant," Dad. - It all started with AIDS. Some say AIDS was created by the US pharmaceutical industry. In a normal family, one of the children would interrupt him. They'd say, "Daddy, you've said that many times." Not with us. It's no respect. It is a mixture of resignation, disinterest and pity. Man's first steps on the moon were filmed in a studio. If you look closely, you can see the flag moving. That is not normal. - I never noticed. Only my mother seems really interested. Maybe that's real love. Listening attentively to a perpetual "I remember..." It was done to boost American industry, especially the automotive industry. It didn't really interest me, because I've always preferred French cars. Citroen or Renault. What is this? We. Together. Are we a nutshell? - Yes. We're two shipwrecked people, alone in the world, and we're floating at sea in a nutshell, and the storms leave us cold. - Cold. Nothing can happen to us in our nutshell. Right, huh? We've had good times. We have said beautiful things. Like that statement by Musset. Listen. "I have often suffered pain, sometimes I have made mistakes, but I have loved. I have lived, and not a fake version of myself created by my pride and my sorrow." I should have said that and not, "Hello, Sonia, I hope you're okay!" I am an idiot. And with him, Sonia? How is he doing? Are you going to run your finger over his nose too? Do you call him dear too? Their feet are unbearable. What are you going to do besides play guitar? Today she calls you "darling". Tomorrow that's just "darling". And then "Romain". And when she says "Romain" with a hint of irritation, it's over. Then you can go back to playing at parties. We were on our way to Aunt Janine's wedding. I remember, I was near Montbéliard. We had picked up a hitchhiker. After less than 10 minutes, Adrien threw up his full breakfast in his lap. It was funny. He got value for money. I'm going to get something... in the car for you. Thank you. Why did I say that? It was a stupid excuse, but I had to go. Are you cold? No, it's okay. Look. What? If he falls, we'll be together for the rest of our lives. Finished? Okay, go! Bravo, Justin! Val, Justin. Continue. fall. Val, Justin. Come on Justin! - Fall on your face! Are you crazy? Excuse me! I left it at home. I'll bring it next time. - Here we are. It's a new recipe. Be kind to me. - What is it? A cake with chocolate and pear. - No yogurt cake? No, with chocolate and pear. Why? - How so? We always eat yogurt cake for dessert. What's your problem tonight? Nothing, I have no problem. I had mentally prepared myself for a yogurt pie, and now... Sorry for your mental preparation, but we wanted something different. Who first? Daddy? What happened? Why the sudden change of the stable situation? Is it a transference ritual like in ancient times? Child... I think the day has come. You are a woman now. From now on you decide on the dessert. Mother, you can't imagine how I'm looking forward to this. Damn. I said I'd call Sonia when the yogurt pie got here. But now it's chocolate with pear. Does that change everything? What would Ange Rigel say? He's hot. - Yes, I agree. Thank you. The crust is a little too heavy. Did you bake it well? I don't know what that means exactly. I had never heard of it. But it must be something serious, because Sophie is really petrified. She seems very hurt. She is very close to... Excuse me? Not baked enough? No, he's nice. - My crust is heavy? That's a joke, Ludo, right? Be silent. Did you help me? New. I have to do everything alone. Everything! While you write miserable articles that no one reads! Honestly, who wants to know that ants exchange hormones through trophallaxis? Do the ants wash your underwear? Do they make your crust crispy? No, so shut up. You make me sick. You're not "I-9." You are an idiot. But she says nothing. And her silence is deafening. I've never seen any cracks in their relationship. It's crazy. This absolute model couple, even if it's not mine, is finally showing signs of weakness. But instead of making me happy, it makes me sad. Yes. My sister moves me. Her wounded silence touches me. I want to take her in my arms. comfort her. Reassure her. But I don't. It is too late. We have forgotten how to do that. We are incapable of showing affection. But I have to do something. Otherwise I know the result. They will go home as if nothing happened. But something will be broken. And one day... Why? Tell me. Does "not baked enough" mean anything to you? What? You can't leave for that. If I'm lucky, it happens before the wedding. Then I don't have to give that stupid speech. But I don't want that to happen. Because despite everything, I like him. Yes, he is annoying with his gulf stream and trophallaxis. But I don't think he was allowed on anyone's team at school. I need to do something. I must stop the first drop of poison from spreading. I think he's super nice. Real? - Yes. Really, Sophie. Excuse me, Ludo, I disagree with you. It is cooked perfectly. The puff pastry is airy and crispy. Refined, subtle... and delicate. Well done, sister. Yes. Sorry. Your cake is amazing, honey. Do you think that? - Even the crust. I am an idiot. You have the right to... - No, no, no. But you always set the bar so high. Your cake is delicious. - Yes! I'll take another piece. Honey. I have an idea, I'll put on some music. I'm so glad I have you. There you go. The incident has been resolved. For the first time tonight I have a positive thought. I am a good person. Too bad Sonia isn't in my head to see that. Hey, Sonia? If you were in my head you would be ashamed of your break. You would pick up your phone and answer. But you won't. I know now. At this time I know I'll never fall in love again. I won't find anyone like Sonia again. Nothing will ever be as good as our love. But what does it matter? I have experienced it. And that's all right. I'm not going to answer anymore, I don't need it anymore I'm not going to answer anymore, everything is fine now I'm not going to answer anymore, peace has returned The storm is over, I don't love you anymore I'm not going to answer anymore, I've found my Romain I'm not going to answer anymore, you're a real idiot I'm not going to answer anymore, peace has returned... Stay calm. Don't get excited. It must be Sébastien about his stupid LP or something like that. Good evening. Don't worry, it won't be long. Or maybe anyway. Yes. There are so many things to say. Things you never say because they are not necessary. Because it's not the right time or because it's too late. But in fact it is never too late. That's right, isn't it, Sophie? It's never too late to ask your sister to stop giving encyclopedias that you will never read. Or tell your brother-in-law we love him. Yes. But that we want one dinner without a science class. It won't be easy. Or trying in vain to explain to your father... Yes, Daddy, wake up. We don't hate your anecdotes, but after 127 times the hitchhiker is tired of being puked under. And finally, to beg your mother, yes, to beg, to dispose of the pendant in the shape of a penis. Mom, I'm telling you. Be strong... it's a penis. There you go. I didn't want to give this speech. I didn't want it. New. I was scared. Afraid I couldn't, afraid of making fun of me or ruining the evening. But the night Ludo asked me... I waited for news from Sonia, my favorite, who had taken a 38-day break. I messaged her at 5:24 PM. She read it at 6:56 pm, but she didn't answer. And at 9.46 pm I finally got a message. A message that said... "And you, how are you?" Correct. "And you, how are you?" is not much. But for me it was fuel for a thousand years. I can't explain it but it was like the light returned after 38 days of darkness. I felt hope again. Because those words contained hope. Tonight my thoughts go to the newlyweds to whom I wish all the happiness in the world. But I'm also thinking of someone who isn't here. A little boy named Justin and who fell with his red bicycle in the park. Thanks to him, I got that "And you, how are you?" at 9.45 p.m. Because you can't break promises made on a park bench. So, thank you, Justin. Thank you for your sacrifice. You fell for love like others fell for their country. But falling on your face isn't a bad thing. It will happen to you often. Because life is a red bike without auxiliary wheels and you occasionally bite the dust. But one day will you also find love, the real love. And that day... your red bike will take off like an arrow from a bow. I wish you a nice evening.
