Plenty of police cruisers out, so we can knock off. Come on. We're NSA. Field work isn't our job. Let's go home. I want dinner and a hot bath waiting for me. And wear that black G-string. I told you I love you. I'm not in love with you. Why look for a stolen van? Talk to the locals, maybe they saw something. Not that anybody here ever sees anything. Hey, cracker boy, I grew up in this kind of neighborhood. And how often did you help out the cops? Look. Clear. Nothing. Looks like you been here a while. Yeah. It's my thinking place. See anyone leave that van while you were thinking? Maybe her? Your approach sucks. You never heard of positive reinforcement? You know, the reward system? What are you doing? What are you--Aah. Is that positive enough for you, or do you want me to reinforce you? Okay, okay. Out there, the light. The light. All right? Shit. Shit. Shit! Shit. Wait. Government agents! Get your hands up! Get up with your hands raised, or I'll blow your brains all over the wall. Get up! Get up! And stop fucking laughing. Aah. Aah! Oh, Christ. Put your dick down and pick up the phone. You there? Don't forget about dinner. Gina's having London broil. If you put ketchup on it, she'll kill you, then me. Life's on the line. Don't let me down. See you, buddy. Informing upon your enemy makes them your friend. That which we cannot speak about, we must pass over in silence. Section chief, please. Privacy is illusion. The open hand cannot grasp discipline. Section chief, please. Steven Grant is present. Fine. Steven Grant has clearance. I'll be down. Okay. Nothing is cruel. Everything is... Thank you. The open hand cannot grasp discipline. The Capitol saw your report. - Yeah. I was expecting this. - No. You weren't expecting this. Informing upon your enemy makes them your friend. Comrade. Comrade. Privacy is illusion. Two steps forward, half a step back. They were friends. Steven Grant, Arthur Kellman, director of the National Security Agency. Mr. Grant, meet John Seward, deputy chief of Central Security. Good to see you healthy. - And officer Aaron Gray. - Pleasure to meet you. - We read the report. - I know it's unbelievable. We believe you. Perhaps we should show him the videotape. - That's why we believe you. - You caught him! Not him. That's not the man you fought. It has to be. How many have teeth like that? Roughly 4,000 worldwide, as far as we can discover. You're shitting me big time. Gentlemen, please follow me. They're a genetic offshoot of humanity. An evolutionary mutation. Their lifespan is measured in hundreds of years. They're incredibly strong. Any nonfatal wound regenerates in seconds. - And they need blood to survive. - Dr. Bathory. The victim--female, Caucasian, 22 years old. Found hanging in an inverted position with bound hands and feet and clothes ripped. Christ. Symmetrical lacerations across the neck severing the carotid artery and the internal jugular veins. The tissue borders are frayed as if torn, not sheared, as you'd expect with a knife or a blade. The x-rays show crush fractures of the carpals. Anything else, doctor? There are six victims with one thing in common-- perforations of the esophagus with multiple lacerations. In plain English, their throats were ripped out and their blood drained. Their reflexes, movements are so much faster than ours. They exist in an uncanny world, a parallel universe. They can blend in like an ordinary human... - unless they choose not to. - Vampires? They're a cell mutation of the human species, a different kind of breed. There are 4,000 of these things? - Yeah. - How do we get rid of them? - We don't. They're not hostile. They revealed themselves to us last year voluntarily. Not hostile? The one that attacked my partner was pretty goddamn hostile. He was a renegade. A deviant. I get it. There's vampires who ain't deviant? Their desires are no different than most people's. - Safety, security-- - Blood. We don't feed on human blood. We've developed a synthetic substitute. We? We? Promise me you just didn't fucking say "we." What makes you such a goddamn expert? You haven't told him. - Hold it, Grant. - Aaron, would you step outside? We were hoping you'd work with him. Grant, listen to me. They're immune to virtually all disease, and that's only a start. The potential military and medical benefits of integrating with them are incalculable. Don't think we've entered into this casually. We've taken all necessary precautions in controlling their population. - What are these precautions? - That's classified. But that is until we see your willingness to fit into this project. You mean I've got to fit in with them? If a Puerto Rican had killed your partner, you'd exterminate them all? Puerto Ricans don't bench-press trucks and drink blood. Neither do they. They've evolved past that. Increasing their population by turning humans into vampires is suicide. I don't think you want someone else find Phil's killer. Aaron is the best man in their police force. He wants this murderer as badly as you do. You must get that a lot. Sometimes. This must have come as quite a shock. Do me a favor. Don't try to be my pal. Let's just go to work. Phil got bit in the neck. There's no way he'll become one of you, is there? For a person to be transformed, there has to be an exchange of blood. Even when that happens, 20 % of the population is naturally immune. Don't worry. Unintentional infection is minimal. You actually fought him, and you're still alive. - I am impressed. - Yeah? Well, you just made my day. Did anything strike you as unusual, aside from the obvious? Actually, yeah. He's killed six others. No eyewitnesses, nothing. This time, there's an eyewitness. He parked his van in plain sight. Could be he got careless or wanted to get caught. Not necessarily caught but seen. This is a critical time for us. We've just revealed our existence to you. It's a decision not all of us supported. Someone may not want an alliance with humanity to succeed. Yeah, and that someone has still got a taste for the real thing. It's broad-fucking-daylight. Aren't you supposed to be bursting into flames? That only happens in movies. We prefer night. The sun's a minor irritation. - That's why I wear the glasses. - Well, I do like the shades. I thought you said we were going over your notes. We are. They're at headquarters. Where the fuck is that, Transylvania? You should be in the movies, Mr. Grant. "Serenity"? You've got to be kidding. Definitely worth the trip. Hungry, Mr. Grant? Bet they make a great blood sausage. There has been a sixth consecutive murder victim killed in the same horrifying manner as the others. Throats brutally cut and all blood drained from the body. Police continue to maintain they have promising leads, but public outcry is growing with each new killing. This is Arthuria Homewood, NSA-TV, with a special news bulletin. Now the science news. A comet fragment exploded in the air - over Tunguska in Siberia. - My son. Mister, get your hands off my--my son. Back off, fucker! - Esther, no. - You're scaring my son. You shouldn't bring him here. - Go. - Get him out of here. - Go. - It's all right. - It's all right. - Get out! The boy is fine. - Are you satisfied? - Look, man, I thought the kid-- You thought. I know exactly what you thought. What were you thinking bringing me here? They don't need some racist cop throwing his weight around. Racist? You calling me a racist? You. Humanity. "Made in God's image." You're all so arrogant. Let's just go to work. - Who the fuck's this? - One of many suspects. Excuse me. Everything is in specific order. Look, man, if we're gonna be working together, we have to be straight-up with each other. Is that right? Some plants would brighten up the place. I didn't know you were a comedian, Mr. Grant. The handcuffs are silver. The bullets--silver-jacketed. Isn't that a little expensive? We're allergic to silver. The wounds won't heal until the bullet's removed. What the fuck is this? Prison cells. Made of plastic compound. They can withstand high explosives. Bars are too easy to bend. No guests? These are set aside for violent criminals. Murderers. No stake through the heart? This is not the movies. And up until now... we have had no use for either. We are a very peaceful people. I've looked forward to meeting you. - Who the fuck are you? - The name is Cross. Dr. Cross. I founded this town. Let's compare notes, shall we? I reviewed the autopsy on the latest victim. No forensic evidence. Her throat was cut with a knife. My partner's wasn't. We couldn't get a dental imprint. He was careful not to bite down. He just used his fangs. The effect was the same as if he had used forceps. We were discussing the possibility that the killings were politically motivated. Oh, most certainly. This is not the work of a man who is in a grip of blood lust. Our synthetic substitute stamped out that behavior years ago. No. The being who perpetrated these horrible crimes is deliberately defying our community. He's making a statement. You too must understand, Agent Grant, our people are afraid. We are an easy target for human paranoia here. I thought that's what you wanted. I advocated coming forward. I said we'd be safe. Help us to find the rogue before it's too late and my people are punished unfairly. This disk contains a database of all known vampires worldwide. Sir, I can handle that. I'll be in the car. - You can't give them names. - We have to trust each other... with our lives. Privacy is illusion. Trust authority. Cross has made overtures for months about this information. How did you persuade him to do it? - He just gave it to me. - But why? God knows. Maybe he really wants what's best for his people. Bad news is, I don't have the faith in them that he does. We spoke of precautions. After the work you put in, you deserve a look. Existence proceeds essence. The open hand cannot grasp. Nothing is true. Everything is permitted. Fleming. Damn it. Dr. Fleming, Agent Grant. Grant is our field man. Show him why we aren't worried about tracking these creatures. This is a sample of their blood infected with a deadly airborne virus we have created. - Highly contagious. - What will it do to humans? Oh, very little. The lab tests are done, and volunteers have started the human trials. The human effect is only mild flu-like symptoms. That's as bad as it should get. The vampire effect... is rather like the Ebola virus. Dispatch. Agent Grant, report to 71st Street. The Freudian Building. Right. Her name's Barbara Steel. Died around 4:30 a.m. Sophomore at the university. Christ. Kellman's daughter goes there. Apartment's owned by Graf Orlock, psychiatrist. He saw patients there. - Anybody locate him yet? - Nope. We put out an APB on him, but nobody's seen him in 3 days. Anybody see her come in? Doorman? Security camera? No. That's what I don't get. There's security cameras everywhere. In the lobby, even in the roof. We reviewed the tapes but nothing. One of Orlock's patients? No idea. His appointment book's missing. Sewage. Is there a way into the sewers? There's a drain down in the basement I think. The superintendent, he can tell you more. But I'll tell you what-- if the killer got in that way, he must've been some kind of Olympic acrobat or something. So, is this Orlock one of you? Yes. When were you gonna tell me? Orlock can't have killed that poor girl. Why not? He's one of Cross' strongest supporters. He has no motive. Something you'll learn tracking humans-- sometimes being a sick fuck is all the motive you need. Hello? Anybody home? There's a book in the fire! Aaron, where the fuck are you? Shit! Shit! Aaron! Get the book! Yaah! Fuck. Come on, let's take this asshole! - No. He's gone. - All that was for nothing? Not quite nothing. It was him. The one who killed Phil. Are you sure? Your senses are heightened, right? Did you recognize him? - His smell? Anything? - No. The odor of burning flesh overpowered everything else. There are pages missing. He was ripping them out... and burning them individually till he heard you coming and threw the whole book in. The leather's protected it. Most of the interior is intact. An appointment next week. "Albert P. 52." Who's Albert P? He wasn't planning on disappearing. No. Exactly the opposite. - Anything listed for today? - Lucy Westenra. Somebody you know? Thanks. For what? For saving my life. Just doing my job. If somebody saves your life, don't act like it's nothing. That's not human. You're supposed to say something. Give him his props. Props? Yeah. - What is "props"? - Proper respect. R-E-S-P-E-C-T. Ah, respect. That's a big-ass house. What is "big-ass"? Excuse me. It's time for his medicine. What, the fucking cat's a vampire? They're born killers, Lucy. If you provoke them, they'll act on their natural instincts. I doubt your friend finds that attitude reassuring. You could easily say the same about us. You're Steven Grant, aren't you? The man who's going to save us from ourselves. We saw your name in Orlock's appointment book. He's my therapist. I have a session. When was the last time you spoke to him? When I made the appointment. What do you know about the dead girl in his apartment? I didn't know there was one. You don't sound surprised to hear it. I didn't think this was a social call. You think Orlock is your rogue? Ridiculous. He has no motive. I love the way everybody talks about motive like it's some kind of big mystery. He got tired of decaf, felt like sucking real blood. Maybe invited you for a taste of the real thing. I don't suck human blood, Detective Grant. And if I did, would I rob some little college girl of hers? No. I'd hunt for some real red meat. You have an alibi for 4:30 a.m.? I was at an after-hours club. That proves jack shit. Since when must I prove anything to you, detective? Anyway, ask the owner. His name is Boudreaux. I was there from 2 until 6. Here's the phone number. So this came from that address? - Where'd you get this? - Orlock's apartment. Interesting. What is Orlock's connection with Boudreaux? It has to do with Orlock's habits. He doesn't like to limit himself. He's also at the top of my list of suspects. So what's keeping us? Miss, if you'd accompany us... you might be of assistance in questioning this Boudreaux. Hmm. Let me change my clothes. She knows something. She knows a lot of things not necessarily connected to our case. She's trying to play me. She's always like that. There's no point in bringing her. She's hiding something, which means she's coming. Which means we'll be here a while. - Allow me. - Thank you. I'll do the talking. Anyone ever tell you your approach sucks? I guess we're in. Now take us to Boudreaux. Ready for the nightlife, Mr. Grant? Be gone! You tamper with forces far beyond your comprehension. He didn't just say that. Quit the Anne Rice routine. We're not amused. Look, what can I tell you? I got a great life. The costume, the accent, gets me all the ass I can handle. If this is about sex and drugs, I got no control over my clientele. This time it's not about drugs, my friend. And it's not about sex. It's about Graf Orlock. He's missing. Oh. Well, Orlock and I, we have common interests. We're not close. If he's not home, I don't know what to say. Boudreaux, you know better than to lie to me. Since you know him so well, perhaps you can tell me about the connection between him and the murders is. Orlock's a pussy, not a killer. That's what I told you. But what's a killer doing hiding in his basement? - West. - Hello, Aaron. Hmm. Keep an eye on him. This is the guy whose rap sheet was on your desk. Feel like telling me who he is? Keeping secrets from your partner, Aaron? - Where's the trust? - His name is West. He's the leader of the opposition to Cross. He believes exposing ourselves to humans is suicidal. Not believes. Knows. I've seen witch hunts, slavery, the massacre of millions of Jews, Aaron. I realize that war between us is inevitable. - Boudreaux? - Orlock. - Oh, crap. - Jesus! - He's mine. Cover West. - Come and get me, human. Orlock? Ah, shit. - Freeze, fucker! - Come and get me, human. Stop fucking laughing! Fuck. Fuck you! Aah! Unh. You're all so pathetic--humans. Come and get me. - Allow me. - Let go! I'm too heavy! Is everyone all right? Everyone's fine. Except West. He's dead. Is he? Yeah. What the...? Going somewhere? Damn it. You'll be happy to know West got away, although he won't get far. But Orlock's dead. So... Tell us what we want to know. Start with what were they doing here. Go to hell. Wrong answer? - I thrive on pain. - Well... Steven, no. Not feeling talkative, huh? You still got one left. No, wait! Wait! Wait! Wait! Orlock called, asked me to set up a meeting with West. - Why? - I don't know. I don't know. West said he didn't, either. Orlock was scared shitless. I've never heard him like that. What was West planning? Some big operation. Some big deal. He said he'd fill me in on it today. Now none of us gets to find out. Let me explain the fucking concept of partners to you. Yes, why don't you? Okay. Partners work together as a team. They don't hold back information. This West is a militant revolutionary who thinks that humans are the great Satan. And you decide he's not worth mentioning. He'd gone underground a long time. It's not like him to show his face here. Okay. Any other leading citizens you forgot to mention? That's enough. - Maybe a Hitler type... - That's enough. ...who'd like to put us all in camps? That's enough. What? I thought you might like to come in to talk about the case. Are you serious? So let's talk about the case. Is that why you're here? If I knew why I was here, I probably wouldn't be. I'm moved that you care at all what I think. Yeah, well, I should probably have my head examined. You are a top homicide detective. The weight of the world is on your shoulders. What do we know from the way you relate to women? You want to be a hero to them. A protector. But they scare you. At some level, you hate them. I'm going to say abusive mother. A younger sister you protected. Am I right? I'm sorry. Sometimes I don't know when to.... So, you figured me out. I guess we're done here. Absolutely. All you have to do is get by the cat. Shit. Is there any other way out of here? I'm afraid not. Locked in a house with a vampire. I used to have nightmares like this when I was a kid. - Whiskey. - Yes, sir. Never did like the taste. I owe you an apology. That Hitler line. No. We've all done things we later regret. I lost my family to the Nazis. - You're Jewish? - Yes. Polish. Gray is an Anglicized name. But that was a long time ago when the Nazis took everything we had. And I decided my family would not be led like sheep to be slaughtered. So we fled through the sewers... ...and into the forests. But this was the middle of winter. We escaped the soldiers, but not the cold. When he found us... ...my wife and daughter were dead. And I was close to following them. He gave me life and a reason to exist. You want to die with your child, with your wife? Or live and take revenge? I found them in a bar drinking. My daughter's body was frozen to the ground, and they were singing. A Jew. What do you want? You piece of shit! You Jewish piece of shit! Sounds like they got what they deserved. Everybody's got that rage inside of them. Everybody. It started as revenge... ...but then when I tasted human blood, everything else was forgotten. The blood lust took control. And it was that moment... ...that I realized what was inside me. What I'd become. What's it like? What? Biting into human flesh and finding the blood. Was it like getting high? It's a place you never want to visit. Come on. Let's go to work. Graf Orlock is one of Cross' lieutenants. The other is Dean Fusco. We have to find him and get some answers. What, here? He has an attachment to his family life. This is the family crypt. His mother's in there. You know Italians and their mothers. - He's been here recently. - How do you know? I can smell him. Some of us gotta get by on police work alone, pal. Have you noticed anything strange in all this? Besides the obvious? Every time we need a lead, someone is willing to supply it. The killer waits for you and your partner at the scene of one of his crimes. He does the same again at Orlock's, conveniently tossing the book into the fire, knowing full well I'll be able to retrieve it. Why is he making it so obvious he's one of us? Do you get the feeling we're being led by the nose? Are you complaining that this case is too easy? If the killer is smart enough to manipulate you, me and everyone else, this is far from easy. I can't believe he doesn't fillet you. He trusts me. I'm not sure I can say the same for you. You still flinch when I touch you. And you're brooding about something, but you won't tell me what. Sorry. - It's hard to get used to. - What I am? Trusting someone. As for what's on my mind, it's this case. We've hit a wall. Trying to find this guy... Dean Fusco. Dean was turned in 1941. He was always kind of stuck there. The way he dressed and talked. He always wanted to be a movie star, but never made it. But Aaron said he was attached to his human side. Yes. Always visiting his mother's grave, his old neighborhood, his sister, in disguise, watching the people he knew grow old and die. He was a very lonely man. Son of a bitch. His sister. Different last name. Do you know her married name? Yeah. Mm... Solerno, Mary. She lives upstate. If you found this rogue, this killer, would it really make a difference? Would it convince your leaders to accept us? If it doesn't, I will. Fusco's sister owns a theater in the town they grew up in. Lucy says she lives upstate. We can check it out on the way to question her. Do you think this is such a good idea? Oh, come on, man. I'm only human. Mm... You go in first, and I'll circle around. Are you kidding me? He's a vampire. No offense. None taken, but he'll smell whoever goes in first. - If it's me, he may run. - So? Hopefully he'll think you're a homeless person. Hopefully. Hopefully. Grim-visag'd war hath smooth'd his wrinkled front. See, see where Christ's blood streams in the firmament. One drop would save me. I must always walk alone. And yet, always I am followed. Sound asleep and yet-- and yet I can hear it! It is me pursuing myself. I-I... - Who the hell are you? - I'm a cop. We had reports of a break-in. Who are you? Oh? I? Oh, my dear boy, I am an actor. I can be anyone I wish to be. Uh-huh. Well, you got any I.D.? A driver's license? Maybe an Academy Award? Oh, I never leave home without it. I know why you're here. You're an errand boy sent by shopkeepers to collect the bill. I hear your heart beat speed up when you lie. So, one more time. Who the hell are you? Okay, take it easy. Drop it! Look what you're doing to my shirt! Sit down! Sit down! Now, we can do this one of two ways. - My way or my way. - Relax. We just want to know who you're hiding from. Was it West? West? Pfft. West is only part of it. It goes much deeper than that. You wouldn't believe who's involved in this. - People I don't even know about. - Just start from the beginning. You know, Aaron, not everybody was wild about this coming-out-of-the-closet routine. Things were already tense. This made it worse. You should have thought of that! You! All right. All right. Orlock heard West was back and into something. Smuggling. We didn't know. We presumed weapons. But West was still spouting the same old revolutionary poop. Would you just stick to the point? We were supposed to find out more. Orlock was supposed to tell Cross. I guess he never got the chance. He phoned me. He was scared. He was hiding. He wouldn't talk on the telephone. He said our lives were in danger. He told me to leave town and he'd contact me. He never did. - He's dead. - He never did! Why would Orlock take a meeting with West if he was afraid? Maybe he was trying to cut a deal. Uhh, it's true. Orlock wasn't the toughest guy in the world. Being on the run was hard on him. - We're missing something. - You dug into West's operation. Did you find anything? Something about a shipment coming in on the 20th. Tomorrow? Weapons smuggling. But with the money involved, West can't pull this off alone. Then somebody else had to be involved. Who? Somebody I thought I knew. Come on. Come on. Lucy. Lucy Westenra. He's lying. No. I'd know if he was. It's all right. We don't know the whole story. You said it yourself. - When is this going down? - I don't know. I don't even know how they were bringing it in. - Planes, trucks-- - It makes perfect sense! She thought she'd send me on a wild goose chase upstate so I'm not around when the shipment came in. She hustled me away so West could escape. Also saved your life. So she could use me. Why are you sticking up for her? - I'm not. - Damn it! I can't believe she'd be involved in this. Please don't report this. They'll assume the worst. Why shouldn't they? We're trying to prevent war, not start one. Please. Don't call in until we've had the chance to check it out. "Albert P." Isn't a person. It stands for Albert Pier. - I came to the same conclusion. - We'll check it out. If it's more than we can handle, I'm calling it in. Fair enough. Grant's here right now. I'll get back to you. That's your official recommendation? Hold off? What the hell is that supposed to mean? Just what it says. This looks more complicated than just plain murder. It's political. They're fighting among themselves. We don't have time for half-baked conspiracy theories. I agree with Mr. Grant. If this is manipulation, I want to know. - Damn it, I thought we agreed. - Something big's going down. You've got to let me get to the bottom of it. If you brought me in because you wanted a stooge, you made a big mistake. What is the rush, Seward? The virus can reach them anywhere. Same thing as before? I'll go in the side and you circle around. As you wish. - This place stinks. - That's good. It'll cover your approach. This is Agent Grant. Get me Kellman. They don't make a move unless I say. Seward's SWAT team's a bunch of trigger-happy motherfuckers. - Where are you? - Albert Pier, number 52. We'll be waiting. Special forces are in position. Rear left perimeter. Bring her over here. Just be patient. We rest. All right, the ship will be here in a few minutes. Are there any questions? I got a question for you. How fucking stupid do you think I am? Back off, fucker! Steven, you don't understand. I wanted to tell you. I couldn't risk it. I understand perfectly. You used me. Get Seward on the radio. We're moving in. Where the fuck is Grant? Put the gun down. I should have known you had something to do with this. Don't be an idiot, Steven. Open your eyes. Look. Fusco led us to the wrong conclusion. Weapons are being smuggled in. People are being smuggled out. Steven, can't you see? My people, they're afraid. Seward, give them the go ahead. Weapons? Is that what you thought? You wouldn't let me tell him. Look what almost happened. Fuck. Seward, you motherfucker! - I didn't give the word! - Steven, you betrayed us! Steven. Yaah! Die. Traitor! I've been waiting for this... - ...for centuries. - Tell them to cease fire! Get off! - Mama! - Take me home. Let's go. - Mama. - No! Steven, save the kid! Take him! I'm going after his parents. Move, move, move! Aah. No! Lucy! Hold your fire! Lucy. - Oh, Steven. No, you're wounded. - It's nothing. - Smell my blood. - I don't care! Steven. What's going on? - How is she? - Stable. The transfusion from Aaron helped. She's not getting any worse. But she isn't getting any better? She's in a coma. But understand. Our physiology is different from yours. The body goes into a coma-like state when it's severely damaged as it attempts to heal itself. - She will fully recover. - What are her chances? Twenty-five percent. I have to get back to Serenity. Half of my people are going into hiding. The other half are arming themselves. It will take a lot of work to clean up the mess you've made. Is that her blood? Yeah. My God. You could be infected. You should check in here yourself. And if I'm infected? You'll transform within three days. Is there any way to stop it? No. What's the point of checking in? There has to be some mistake. You couldn't have shot my men! Tell me I'm wrong. Go ahead! Tell me, goddamn it! Your men weren't even scratched. I shot at their body armor. The only reason I didn't shoot them in their heads was because I knew they were acting on your orders. I had to use my judgment. You were in there a long time. I was in there five minutes! Informing on your enemy makes them your friend. I called you in to tell you you're going back to your old job. The official story is you're on medical leave. Seward wanted to fire you. I said overruled him. - He's too busy to fight, so... - Busy with what? The situation's becoming untenable. - We're releasing the virus. - Not yet. I'm close, damn it. Last night, another girl disappeared from the university. She is my daughter. We can't stop anyone from leaving. Make sure they have enough of the blood substitute to last. We're at the laboratories already. Good. It's Steven Grant. Tell him I'm busy. He says it's urgent. Yes? They're mixing up a big supply of the virus all over the world. And I should trust you? I screwed up. I know. But you have to trust me. Right now, your entire race is living on borrowed time. Why should I believe this fantastic story? Your senses are heightened. You tell me if I'm lying. We must do something. Our people will all die. So Agent Grant is going to steal a sample of the virus? Where is he planning to get it from? From Fleming's laboratory? Yes. That's the name he used. You knew of this? I gave you your life. And I will take it. You know, I really ought to thank you. You just make everything so easy. The incident at the pier was a gift. Not only did it give us a perfect opportunity to release the virus, but it got the slime so worked up, they believed everything I told them. Your gun. Give me your gun, slowly. Well, you were sabotaging the virus. You go for your gun, there's a struggle. Et cetera. Et cetera. Et cetera. Not original... but it works. So the virus is lethal to humans. Oh. There's that community-college education coming into play. I'm actually quite proud of it. You see, the initial infection with vampires is quite severe, and in humans quite mild. But after a week, the vampires recover, the humans... die. You're human. You got an antidote or vaccine? Oh, no. No, it doesn't apply. By the time the virus has been released, I won't be human anymore. He's going to turn me tonight. Who? You're not James Bond, I'm not Blofeld. No more explanations, and no last-minute escapes. How about no bullets? Say something about my education now, you fuck! I knew you'd come. I knew I could rely on you. I promised you'd never know disease, weakness... or pain again. And I intend to keep that promise. I bled him dry. He is starving. I'm surprised that he's been able to keep from trying to attack you this long. It's all right. I've sent everyone home. We have time. You will be pleased to know that you won't be implicated in Fleming's death. His body will never be found. Granted questions might be asked. But by tomorrow, their minds will be on other things. You will be dead, and I'll have given them their rogue. I'll have killed him, of course, but it's too late to keep you from becoming his last victim. Pity. I like you. You have qualities that most people today lack-- determination... loyalty to friends... and partners. It was you. You killed Phil. I took no pleasure in it. Playing a murderer has been extremely distasteful to me. I'm not a violent man by nature. Yeah, right. All this talk about peaceful coexistence. All along, you're planning on wiping out humanity. Don't be ridiculous. Civilization would collapse. That's not what I want at all. I already have a cure. It's made from our blood. And I plan to share it with humanity. It will make people resistant to the virus, to all disease. One race. I saw with my own eyes what happened to the Indians, the Africans, the Jews. The only difference was race. We can't fight you... but we can't trust you, either. This is the only way. No. No. No. No! Incredible! I don't think I have ever seen willpower like this! Too bad. It's utterly pointless! Go! Excellent choice. These silver bullets are overkill on you. Aaron! But you will leave an expensive corpse. That's enough of that. Goodbye. That hurt. Not bad for a final act. But not quite good enough. Hang in there. Hang in there, partner. I think we won. The catastrophe that almost befell us could only have been created by mutual cooperation between our two people. And mutual cooperation is the only way it could have been stopped. We owe Steven Grant and Aaron Gray a debt for showing us that, for good or evil, we are no different. And I owe them a more personal debt for my daughter's life. Sorry I missed it. Are you all right? You seem strange. I got tested yesterday. I'm not infected with your blood. I never will be. I'm immune. One of the twenty percent. I can never be like you. Forty years from now... you won't have changed. I'll be old... or dead. I wasn't gonna tell you till you got back on your feet. I didn't want to upset you. Why did you think I'd be upset? Because I'll lose you in 40 years... or am I losing you now? I just thought-- I mean, when you heard... Steven... do I strike you as the kind of woman who... who... who takes the easy way out? No. Then the question is... are you that kind of man? You know it won't be easy. Nothing good ever is. - What's up? - They want us downtown. I'll see you soon. I'll be waiting. You drive, partner.
