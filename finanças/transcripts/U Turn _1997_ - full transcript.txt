Hello? Hello! Who cut off my music? You cut my music off. - You Harlin? - No. Darrell. - Is Harlin around? - I doubt it. He's dead. - Do you own this place? - Yep. Why they call it "Harlin's"? 'Cause Harlin used to own it. Could you take a look at my car? I think the radiator hose is busted. All right. I think it's gonna be another hot one today. 'Course, then again, it might not be. You can't ever tell around here. When it's hot, I don't like to get out of bed. 'Course, when it's cold, I don't either. - Look, Harlin. I got... - It's Darrell. Whatever. Could you just take a look at the radiator hose? I think it's busted. It's your radiator hose. It's busted. I know that. What'd I just tell you? If you know so damn much, why didn't you just fix it yourself? If I could do that, you think I'd be standin' here wastin' my time? - Can you fix it? Or do I have to go someplace else? - Someplace else? Bud, someplace else is 50 miles from here. That old station downtown-- that thing closed-- must've been, God, 3 years ago or somethin' like that. Okay. I'm stuck. Ya happy? Now can you fix it or not? - Yeah, I can fix it. - Great. Great. I'll have to look through the yard here, see if I can't find a hose like that one. - It's gonna take a little time. - How much time? I don't know. You know, time. What time is it now? About 20 after 10:00. Arizona. - Twenty after 10:00. It's gotta be 90 already. - It's 92. - What happened to your hand anyhow? - An accident. Accident? You got to be more careful, bud. See, hands is important. Lemme show you somethin'. Don't know if you can still see it.

You can't do that yourself? Hell, no, I can't do it myself. I'm blind. Can't you see that? - Yeah, lost my eyes in the Vietnam. - I'm sorry. I didn't know. Don't be so sorry.

I'm gonna take you for a walk. I'll see ya later, unless I, uh, come across somethin' worse. Hey, beautiful, can I give you a hand? - I'm just goin' to my car. - Well, that's right on my way. My mother told me never to accept offers from strangers. I'm Bobby. See? Now we're not strangers. See how easy that was, beautiful? - Do you have to call me that? - Well, I don't know your name. Maybe I don't want you to. Maybe you wouldn't have stopped walking if you didn't. - You're pretty full of yourself. - I like that about me. You? - It's Grace. - Grace, can I carry your package? - Oh, geez. - Sure you can manage? - Uh, yeah. - You want me to carry your pack for you? No. No. It's no trouble. What happened to your hand? An accident. You should be more careful. It's just some drapes and curtain rods. Just got so tired of the old ones. Had 'em long as I can remember. My mother made 'em. Saw 'em and just knew I had to have 'em. Ever see somethin' and just knew you had to have it? Yes, I have. This is it. - Thank you, Bobby. - Ah, you're welcome, Grace. - You're not from around here, are you? - I just drove in this morning. My car overheated up the road. Lucky it didn't happen out in the desert. Day like today, you'd be dead in no time. When are you leaving? Not until I get my car back. Who knows how long that'll take? And here I made you all hot and sweaty. - Mornin', Grace. - Mornin', Sheriff. Got my drapes. It's about time. I see you got yourself a helper too. Mornin', Sheriff. Nice to meet you, son. Same to you, Sheriff. I could use some help gettin' these boxes in the house. You could shower, get somethin' cool to drink. You're still lucky. Where are you coming from? Oh, all over. Detroit, Chicago, Miami. I gotta stop in Las Vegas. I got unfinished business there. - So, what is it you do? - Whatever pays best. A little bartending. Used to teach tennis. Used to play some competitively. I never played tennis. Enough excuses. I'm sick of your bullshit! Easy. Easy. Bobby, I want my money. - I want my money! - You're gonna get your money. You don't have to do this. You don't have to do this. You have two weeks, asshole. Take two for now. Finger one! Ahh! Finger two. Thought you might like some more lemonade. That'd be great. What do you do anyway? Little of this, little of that. Mostly I tell fortune. Where'd you learn that? From my father. Come here. Down. There's something in your past. Something. There's a pain. There's something you want very badly. It seem very far away to you right now. But you're determined. You're determined... and you'll do what you must to get it. You can tell all that by my face? It tell me what every face tell me. Everybody have a past. They have pain, and they have something they want. What is it you want? The same thing you do. Really? I wanna hang drapes. Can you hold me? Tighter. I won't break. There. Lift me down. You could put me down now. I'm safe. I'm tired of hangin' drapes. Now what should we do? Well, I got an idea. What would that be? All right, Grace, no more games. And what game you wanna play? You carry my boxes for me and I fall into bed with you? I think I can find my own way back into town. Maybe I like to know about a man first. Maybe I like to find out what he's made of. Thanks for the lemonade. You still didn't answer my question. - Still playin'. - What is it you want? - Grace! - Jake! I thought you were in Phoenix. Who the hell is this? - Who in the hell are you? - I'm her husband. Hu-- Husband? Now who are you? It better be good or, God help me, I'm gonna break you in half. Whoa, whoa. Easy, chief. I was just helping up your wife. We met in town. I was givin' her a hand with the drapes. That's all. - Doesn't look like you were hangin' drapes. - That's all that happened, I swear. - I know what that means. - Grace, tell him. Damn it, Grace! Tell him! And I suppose you didn't have anything to do with it, Grace. He just wandered up here hisself! I got a mind to put you over my knee and paddle your ass raw! Is that what this is about? You sucker me up here... so the two of us can beat the shit out of each other over you? Forget it. You don't just walk in here and walk out. - You broke my nose! - Ohh, it ain't broke. Get goin', pip squeak. What the fuck do you want? I'll give you a lift. It's too hot to be walkin'. People die out here, you know. You're not still upset over that little love tap, are ya?

Oh, you a sailor man, are ya? Oh, that'd be the life, huh? Just get on a boat and sail away. You know, a man could pretty well disappear like that. - McKenna, about your wife-- if I'd known she was married-- - Married? Nah. Wouldn't have made a difference to you. Not a whit. You know why? - Because you're a man without scruples. - Hey, man. Oh, I can smell it on ya. - Hey! - Yeah. Yeah. That's the sweat of a man that hasn't an honest bone in his body. Now don't be offended, lad. A man who's got no ethics is a free man. Do as he pleases. I envy ya that. Besides, a woman with her looks and a man of my age-- I mean, what was I to expect? Women.

I bet you just wanted to pull her pants down and hog her out. And then I come bustin' in like a wild bear. I can tell you got a temper on ya. I bet you just wanted to snap her neck, huh? I bet ya just wanted to kill her. - Would ya? - Would I-- Would I what? Would ya kill her? Why would I kill her? Because I-- I'm just sick and tired of her goddamn little games. Because you could do it, goddamn it. You could do it and drift away on that boat and no one'd ever see you again. I got a $50,000 life insurance policy. I would be happy to give the man who does her in a good chunk of it. - McKenna, I done some things. I'm not a murderer. - Oh. Oh, yeah. Well, how do you know if you never tried, huh? It's a joke. You're tryin' to rattle me. Right? Yeah. Yeah, yeah. That's right. It's nothin' but a joke. That's all. Enjoy your stay, lad. No. - Aw, man. - Gimme a soda. - Mmm? - Got a soda?

I mean-- I know I'm coming up with what's gonna sound like a highly improbable story, but I had the money, I swear. I had it. I'm on my way to Vegas and my car breaks down in the middle of fuckin' nowhere. So now I've got your money, and I go into this little grocery store in this hick town, you know, to get somethin' to eat, and the place gets robbed. Let me guess. This robber gets your money? Two. There were two of them, and they both get nailed. The old lady shot 'em... with a shotgun. - Old lady? - Right? She kills 'em both. The money's in my bag, and it gets shredded into bloody pieces. Not one bill's left alive. I mean... what are the odds? So I was wondering-- Uh, uh, there's a-- I-I thought maybe you could-- you could wire me $150 so I can get my car out of the garage. 'Course, I'd pay it back with the rest. Which you don't have. But which I could get. That's no problem. I can sell my car in Vegas. Where are you?

You took a life insurance policy on her... $50,000-- and you'd cut it up with the man that killed her. Oh, boy, I think this heat's gettin' to you, the way you're ramblin' on. You're the one that brought it up... in your car this morning. - A man doesn't always mean the things he says. - You meant it. What makes you say that? 'Cause you're a slimy bastard who'd have his wife killed to get his hands on some money. What does that make you? The slimy bastard that's gonna do it. I think you're a jealous man, Jake. If you can't have Grace to yourself- You're not the sharing kind. I have what you call, uh, a love-hate relationship with Grace. You love her, but you hate her. No, I hate lovin' her. I hate havin' to tolerate the little games she plays. Like fuckin' half this town behind my back and laughin' at me! The bitch! She wants me to hit her, and when I hit her, she likes it! She just likes to fuckin' torture me. Goddamn it! But she's-- She's my family. She's my little girl. My baby. I couldn't stand to watch her eyes roll back in her head... as she sucks her last breath. No. Not me. But you, you boy, you got a killin' in you. Okay. Let's say I want the bitch dead. What is it you want? How do you put a price on murder? Oh, well, uh, you know, I put it at, uh, $50,000, minus your cut, of course-- which is? - Twenty. - Twenty thousand? No. No, no, no. I don't have that kind of money. I mean, you know, I won't get the insurance until months after she's dead. - How much can you get? - Oh, uh, maybe, uh, $10,000? That's a maybe. I need thirteen. Thirteen? That's a bit much. We're not talkin' about buyin' a car, Jake. We're talkin' about killin' your wife. Now it's 13 or it's nothin'. Well, you drive a hard bargain. But I had a feeling you were my boy when I first met ya. Well, looks like we got ourselves a contract. Do we shake hands? Well, if you can't trust the man you've hired to kill your wife-- Now here's the thing: It's gotta look like an accident. If it don't, it's no good. 'Cause I won't get a dime, and it'll be my neck that's on the choppin' block... while you're livin' it up somewhere. How do you want it? It can't be done at the house. - It should be, uh-- - We should talk about some money up front. Oh, sure. Why don't I buy you a plane ticket right outta here while I'm at it? Oh, I know you. Here's what you do. You go to the house to see her. - And tell her what? - I don't know. Tell her you had to see her. You know, sweet talk the woman. A young buck like you must be good like that. And then, maybe, shift the conversation, get her thinkin' about that Jeep of hers, 'cause she loves that thing. Maybe the only thing she does love. She'll wanna take you for a ride out in the desert-- someplace quiet, someplace deserted. Ridin' through the red rocks and the mesas. She loves it out there. So do I. I guess we got that in common. There won't be anybody around for miles except the two of you-- except prairie dogs, that's all. And then maybe, uh-- Well, you can sweet talk her a little if you like. It makes no difference to me. Put her at ease. Make her feel relaxed. And then, uh, do it. You could leave him. It's not that easy. Walk away. Maybe you can take chances. You can wander around like some stray wherever you please. I can't. I don't wanna be alone. I wish I was a bird. Some of the old people on the reservation... used to think people could actually change into animals. I wish I could. If I was a bird, I would fly to Florida-- Disney World. I always wanted to go there. And I'll fly to New York, maybe. I'd fly to St. Louis and all over Texas. Then I'd fly to California. Then I guess I would've seen it all. Then I could die. They say you don't feel anything-- that the shock kill you before you hit the ground. I've always imagined it's just like flying. Mmm. I bet right now... you don't know if you wanna kill me... or fuck me. No! No, stop. I can't. Stop it. Stop. No! I can't. What's the matter, Grace? - Nothing. - Doesn't feel like nothin'. You should just get outta town, Bobby, quick as you can. Don't do this to me, Grace. I've been fucked over by too many women. You're becomin' the queen of hot and cold. It's such a mess. With Jake, I mean. There's nothin' I know more about than a mess. Jake was with my mom... after my real father died. Used to call me his little half-breed. Kept my mom on the side, you know? 'Cause he had a wife someplace else. He controlled me. You look so pretty. - Would ya put your arms-- Your head-- - No! Don't fuck around on me like your mama. Oh! He was raping me the whole time. For years. My mom-- It tore her up 'cause she couldn't do nothin' about it. She become alcoholic. They found my mama right down here. At the bottom of Apache Leap. And Virgil-- Sheriff Potter... He said she was drunk and went insane. But I never believed she ran off that cliff by accident. She was like me. She just wanted to fly away. I'm so sorry. Whatcha gonna do? Life, right? You ever been to California? Yeah. Is it pretty? It's another world. There's beautiful beaches. Blue water. Clear sky as far as the eye can see. Take me with you. - Grace, I wish I could. - Please? I won't hang on you. - You could dump me as soon as we get there. - Grace. Grace. - I just wanna get outta here. - I can't even get outta here. I need 150 bucks to get my car back from that crazy mechanic. - Darrell? You know, he and Jake-- - Do you-- Do you have money? Jake never give me more than 20 bucks at a time. If you could get money, I'd get us outta here. There's money. A lot. Where? Jake-- he hides it... in a safe in the bedroom in the floor. My mom said there more than $100,000 in there. - In cash? - There nothin' else with Jake. He sits there, he laugh, he talk to himself and he counts it. $100,000. Son of a bitch. What you mean? Well, if it's in a safe, we need the combination. It take a key. And he keep it on him all the time. It's always slappin' up against me when we do it. If he's got the key on him all time, how do we get it? Kill him. N-- Uh, Grace, I-I can't kill anybody. It not like he a young man, Bobby. He had time to live. It would be quick. He don't even have to feel it. Look, just sometime in the middle of the night. You could just come up behind him... when he's asleep... or when he's poundin' on me. You could just... Oh, geez! Bobby! Bobby! I see it. It's in you! I see it in you. I see death. It's in your heart. Let it go for me. Do it for me, Bobby! I'll do anything for you! Take me back to town. You need the money, Bobby! How you gonna get outta here? It's three mile back to town. There's more than $100,000. A lot more. Where you going? No! Get back here right now! Bobby. Hey, you there! Hey! They're cursed. They're cursed. All the miners last century killed off the Indians at the mine. Earth ran red with blood. I seen some peculiar things on a hot day. I seen a scorpion sting itself to death. A little killer killing itself. I seen a coyote kill itself too. Bite and tear its own legs. Nearly tore one clean off before it bled to death. So, what a white man is gonna do-- White man is gonna get himself killed just, just... rubbing shoulders with another, you know. - You know. - Kissy, kissy. Nice little pussy. Little pussy there. You see it coming. And that's gonna be the death of him. Sure see a lot for a blind man. Just 'cause I ain't got eyes don't mean I can't see. I can see pretty good. That's 'cause we're all just eyes in the same head. Everything is everything. - What? - Everything is nothing too. Yeah, well, maybe one day I'll have time to sit on a corner and spout wise. Think you're gonna live that long, cocksuckin' motherfucker? Everybody's got a mother. You know that? Can't they understand you don't rip up the mother? The Mother Earth. And you just take everything. It's like the Cracker Jack box. The more you eat, the more you want. I got things to do. You got something to do? Well, don't see me stopping you. But ain't you got a little something for the infirmed? I'm a little short today, old man. I'll catch you next time. Ah. Your lies are old, but you tell them pretty good. Hey, mister? Patsy Cline. Hey. - Mister, I just wanted to thank you. - For what? For defendin' my honor this afternoon. I hate to bust your bubble, but I wasn't defending your honor. - Yeah, but you was gonna fight for me. - No. I wasn't gonna fight for you. I was gonna beat the shit out of your boyfriend. He ain't my boyfriend. I let him take me out and stuff, but I ain't spoken for. Not yet, that is. Get this through your head, little girl: I ain't goin' for ya. And if this guy Toby likes you, marry him 'cause you're not gonna do better in this town. Well, that's what I thought until you came ridin' in. I saw your car over at the gas station. That's a cool car. You wanna take me for a ride? Desert's kinda lonely this time of day. I-I don't wanna take you for a ride. I just want... Hey. You don't have 150 bucks that I-- - You wouldn't have 150 bucks that I-- - Mister! - Oh, shit. - That's right. You better be scared. I told you it wasn't over. Now I find you sneakin' around with my girl behind my back! I'm not sneakin' around with your girlfriend. Will you tell him? - What the fuck you doin', then? - You're too late, Toby. We're gonna get in his fancy car... - ...and ride off and leave you behind. - What are you talking about? - What's your name, anyway? - That tears it, mister. I'm gonna bust you up but good! I'm-I'm gonna take you and break you up into a million pieces, and take those pieces and break them in a million more! You don't even know what you're dealin' with. I'm crazy! I'm psycho-crazy! I know. You're T.N.T., and when you go off, somebody gets hurt. That's right. Okay. Toby Tucker, it don't matter to me if you beat him up and knock out all his teeth, and he's just droolin' and bleedin' all over hisself, 'cause we love each other, and we're gonna run off, and I'm gonna have his love child! - Would you shut up! - You're gonna pay for that, mister. You're gonna pay. Come on. - Toby! - Oh. Hey, Sheriff Potter. Toby, I just come from your mama's place. She's worried sick about you. Says she ain't seen you since this morning. No, no, that-that just ain't true, Sheriff. I-I was just home for lunch. Boy! I don't wanna see nothing but smoke comin' out of your ass on your way home. Yes, sir. Come on, girl. Bye, mister! Don't go nowhere without me! I wanna have your love child! Where you goin'? Up to Harlin's. Get in. You know, there was a young fella up at Jamilla's place today when it got hit. Now the way she tells it, he got whacked around pretty good by one of them robbers. I wish I could help you, Sheriff, but... I just wanna get up to Harlin's and get out of town as quick as I can. That's a nasty cut you got there. Well, I fell on a rock. It's not as bad as it looks. Everything all right, Virg? Oh, yeah. Just fine. Where you goin'? Get somethin' at Darrell's. So, how's the wife? That little Eskimo baby walkin' yet? Yeah. Yeah, just fine. - Fine, huh? Yeah. - Mm-hmm. You haven't seen my wife, have you? I'm lookin' for her. No, I haven't seen her, Jake. If I do, I'll sure tell her you're lookin' for her. Yeah. What you got there, some trash? Kinda peculiar how things happen, ain't it? I mean, a man's car breaks down. There's a robbery. People get killed. All that money. Now-- Now old Jake is out lookin' for his young wife. Then you show up. Time's runnin' out, son. I'll be seein' you in the mornin'. Hey, there, bud. I was startin' to think you wasn't comin' back. One of them days when you feel like you're running around in circles, and you ain't no closer to where you was tryin' to get than when you started. - You been there, huh? - Oh, hell, yeah. When you feel like that, don't think there's anything else you can do 'cept tough it out. - You believe that? - You think bad, then bad's what you get. That's a pretty decent philosophy you got there. Well, no charge. Hey, Darrell, about the 150 bucks-- Two hundred. Next town I get to, I'll send it. I swear to God. Two hundred. What? You owe me $200. This morning you said it was gonna run me $150 for the hose. Well, yeah, for the hose. But when you left this mornin', I had to replace a gasket and that's gonna run you another 50. - Nobody said anything about replacing a gasket. - It was shot. I don't give a fuck. I didn't tell you you could do it, and you can't do unauthorized work. So all of a sudden you know everything there is to know about being a mechanic. Didn't you read the sign? I can't do unauthorized work. What am I supposed to do, let you drive out of here with a bad gasket? Then you get in an accident and get killed... or worse. And who do they blame? They blame me. And there goes my reputation. What reputation? You're-- You're just an ignorant, inbred, tumbleweed hick! Is that an insult? Are you insulting me? Listen to me, you stupid fuck. - I will-- - You listen to me, goddamn it, you sorry son of a bitch! You owe me money. And this car ain't goin' no-goddamn-where till I get it. Do you understand me? And if you take another five hours, by God, I'll find another $50 worth of work to do on the son of a bitch. Now you get your ass outta here before I call the sheriff, who knows me. Oh! You wanna play? I'll play with you. Come on. I'll play with you. You wanna smash something? Huh? - Here, I'll smash something. - Okay, okay. Okay. Please. What's the matter? All the fight gone out of you? Just... leave my car alone. It's too goddamn late. You pissed me off. Goddamn it, you son of a bitch! You son of a bitch! There you go sweet-talking me again. Hey, Darrell, I-I'm gonna get you your money. Let me... just get a couple of things out of my trunk. Okay? No, you won't. What did you do to my trunk? I had to pop the lock. You didn't leave me no trunk key. You had to get in the trunk? When I work on a car, I work on a car, bud. You motherfucker! Motherfucker! You motherfucking, pig-sucking, son of a-- - You can't help yourself, can you, mister? - Fuck... you! You're outta control. - I need a ticket. - Where to? Uh, outta here. - Uh, in particular, sir. - I don't care. I just want to get out. Mex-Mexico. Let's look. Uh, you could go to... Cuidad Juarez. That would be the local. That leaves in two hours. - How much? - One way is $30.55. Yeah. $30.55. Twenty more'll get you back. Nope. One way. Oh. All right. Okay. Twenty. $27.60. I have, uh-- $27-- $27.60. That's what I have. Well, sorry, sir. Ticket is $30.55. I bought a beer. That was a dollar something. Gave a quarter... to a girl for the jukebox. - Then, the blind man-- - I see that, sir, but I'm sorry. This ticket is $30.55. I'm a little bit short. That figures. I just wanted to get out of here, you know? I wanted to-- Excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse me, ma'am. I don't... I don't think you understand. You see what they did to me? They're gonna come for me. They're gonna kill me! If I don't get a ticket, I'm gonna have to do something I don't want to. I-- I don't wanna hurt anybody. - I understand. - I don't wanna hurt anyone. I'm gonna do whatever I have to do to get out. What I'm trying to say... I have to get outta here! Sir, I really need for you to remain calm, okay? 'Cause I can't even breathe right now, okay? I am going to give you the ticket. Please try and remain calm, sir. You can keep the change. It's bus number 323, and it will leave at 7:52 tonight. - 7:52 tonight. Mm-hmm. - God! I'm-- I'm sorry. I just... Well, you know... I have to take a break right now. I've very sorry. Come on. Hey! What is this shit town? A pigsty. Hey, got you, shit. Hey, Bobby Cooper, got you! Where's the fire, sweetheart? I don't know how things work in Nevada, but we got speed limits in this state, boy. What? I'm going five miles an hour. I'm looking town. I'm a tourist. Whoa, what's that accent? You ain't one of them Russians, are you? - Yes, I am Russian. Da. - I'm also rich Russian. Maybe we could work something out. You tryin' to bribe me, boy? Just 'cause you goddamn Russians ain't commies no more... don't you think that money can buy everything, by God. Uh-oh. Oh-ho. What have we here? Concealed is a definite no-no in this town, Ivan. - Know anything about Jamilla's grocery store? - What fucking grocery store? Get over there and spread 'em, motherfucker. What the fuck you doing?

I've been doing nothing but thinking about you since I left. I want to get out of here and take you with me. Thought you couldn't get your car. I could if I had Jake's money. Is that what changed your mind? The money? I don't give a damn about the money. I want you, and I wanna get out of this shit hole, and there's only one way to do it. Are you sure? About me, I mean. I came back... for you. It's you that I want. I only stormed off this morning... because you spooked me when you talked about Jake. But I've had nothing but time to think, and it all comes back... to you and me and us getting out of here. We gotta get that money, baby. We get the money, I get the car and we are the hell out.

It's not me you have to worry about, Jake. It's her. She wants you dead! She wants your money! What are you babbling about? Think about it. How do you think I got in here? Did you hear any glass break? Did you hear any door shatter? How'd the evening end, Jake? When you went to bed, did she linger just long enough, just long enough to leave a back door open?

I feel like someone took a million pounds off my shoulders. Where should we go? Hawaii. I read about it. I dreamed about going there and... lying on the beach. Letting the water... lick up against my toes. I'd kill to go there. You already have. I thought you'd left me back there. - What are you talking about? - When I got back from the garage and the Jeep wasn't there, I thought you'd left, taken off with the money.

You had to fuck him, didn't you? Huh? Baby, I would never do that to you. He killed Jake, and he said he'd kill me if I didn't come with him. - All he wants is the money. - What? - Don't lie to me! - Okay. But he never made me come. Really, Virgil, I was only doing what I had to do so we could be free. Just like we talk about. It meant nothing. You're fuckin' him too? Is everybody fucking everybody in this crazy goddamn town? You find this guy, get him to do your dirty work, and you can take the money and dump me! No, baby. You got it wrong. This road don't go to Globe, Grace. Now, where is it you was gonna meet me? It's not like that, Virgil. Look. I got the money right here. Right here. I watched you fuck that pervert for years. All the time you was tellin' me you loved me. What happened to us going to Milwaukee? Gonna open up the finest sportin' goods store that city ever did see. Just you and me, Grace. What happened? Talk, talk. All you'd do was talk. And all I'd do was sit around getting older waiting for you to free me! You never did! He did! This is some girl you and me got here, Bobby boy. Course, you have had a lot of practice. Haven't you, darlin'? Goin' way back, just like your crazy mama! Shut up, Virgil! Just take your share of money and get outta here. I don't want the fucking money! It's you! It's you, Grace, or nothin'. The whole thing. I want you to be my wife. What do you say, Grace? You sound just like Jake. Just go back to your family. They love you! Wait, we got more. There must be $200,000. We split it three ways, and we all just walk. I said shut up, boy! You don't know jack shit about what's goin' on around here! - Virgil, stop! - Get the fuck back, Grace! Goddamn it, I'm tellin' you! She tell you that story about wanting to be a little bird and fly away? Was you gonna help her fly away, asshole? - Virgil, stop it! - Grace, get back! Did she tell you the story about how old Jake forced her to marry him? That's a good'n, that one. And how he killed her crazy mother? Well, I bet I got a story that she didn't tell you. And it's the best one of all. Right, baby? Virgil! - You see, old crazy Jake... - Virgil! ...was really her papa. No, Virgil! And she liked fuckin' her papa. Now she's killed that sumbitch, just like she's gonna kill you. - No, you! - Ahh! Grace, no! Shit. Bobby, get the fuck up! Aren't you gonna ask me? Ask you what? What kind of horrifying, sick shit is coming next? Don't you really wanna know? Was Jake my father? Was I fu-- - What do you want me to say? - Yes, I was! I was fucking my daddy! And I married him! I married him! Okay? I just wanted to be a kid. And he took that from me. They treated me like-- like meat. A piece of meat. Fuck them! They fucked the whole town! They deserved to die! Grab him further up. Bend your knees this way. - Wait. - Ready? See ya, Virgil. God bless. Is this bothering you? My hand is bothering me, Grace. Gotta burn this. What do you think? Now that Jake's dead, got all the money, don't need ya no more? Might just sneak up behind you one day and pop? Don't you think I would have done it by now if I wanted to? Come on, baby. What can I do to make you feel more relaxed? Give me my gun back. Why don't we just finish what we started? What do you think happen to people's spirit when they die? Nothing happens, Grace. They're dead meat. That's it. You don't believe in anything, do you, Bobby? I believe in this moment. You wanna help me with him? He must be 300 pounds. You hit me! You hit me, Bobby. Motherfucker! Well? Well, nothing. We dump Jake, split the money, then you're on your own. Don't leave me, Bobby. I wanna stay with you. So the next cop pulls us over, you can sell me out again? I was just baiting him. I had to tell him that. Just like you told Jake you was gonna kill me. Try Mexico. With all that bread, you'd live like a queen. I don't wanna go to Mexico, Bobby. I wanna stay with you. Don't you think I care about you? I think you're a lying, backstabbing, psycho bitch! And one day you'll kill me. But it's nice to know you cared. Come on. It's not such a bad thing we split. Could be months before they find a body out here with all the mountain lions. We gotta get the fuck outta Arizona. Remember: no body, no crime. First rule of evidence. We can be in Phoenix by noon. Get rid of the car, get a new one. You'll find somebody else. There's always hope with $100,000. Hope's a four-letter word. Hold him. You make a pretty couple. You should have been more careful, Jake. See ya around. Shit. Grace, help! Grace, help me! Grace! Grace! Oh, God! Please! Don't go, Grace! Sorry I hit you! Grace! Bobby? Thank you, Grace. Thank you. Can you make it back up? I broke my leg! Grace, in the trunk there's a tow rope! Get the tow rope, tie it off. I think it'll make it down here. Bobby, the trunk is locked! You have to throw the key up! Bobby! I can't throw anything, Grace. I can't move! You have to come down! It's the only way! You can make it, Grace! Please help me! Okay. I'm coming down. Just wait! Thank you. I knew you couldn't leave me! We've been through too much together. Grace, where are you? Grace! I'm comin' down! We'll go to Mexico! We're meant to be together! Bobby, I can't do this alone! You gotta pull yourself together! I'm not gonna leave you! I never wanted it to go down like this. It was different with you, Bobby. You had dreams like me. We could still make this work. I didn't wanna hurt you. They're right here. You know why else I can never leave you? Why? Because I love you, Grace. - I love you. - I love you, Bobby. I don't know whether to love you... or kill you! I love you, Grace, but I can't trust you. - You're such a good-- - Jake! Jake! Jake! Jake can't help you. You're still lucky. Adiós. Oh, shit!
