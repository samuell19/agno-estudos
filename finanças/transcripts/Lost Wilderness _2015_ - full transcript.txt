[inspirational music] There you are. Got you now. Hey! [Jase] Hey, that's mine! [Upbeat chase music] You're not getting away with this! [Jase] Give me the bag back, you little rat! [Dom] Yes! Nice try loser! [Jase] You can't outrun me punk! Pull over! [Dom] Let's settle this! [music ends] Who's got the juice now boy? Bet you think that was payback for me catching you with your pants down, huh? What can I say, someone's got to teach you a lesson. Nice one meatball. What was that about not having the juice? Pride before the fall son. Cool! Top of the morning boys. How is it out there? It's alright. Do we get to ride those today? I wanna ride with you. Yah, maybe later. I think your mom has more inside. I'm ah, I'm gonna save mine for later. Well, come on kids, let's get ready, get cleaned up for a great day ahead. I saw that. Boys, come inside. So? Who's got the juice now? Shut up. What was that all about? We got up early and went for a ride. Sorry. You guys know I do not want you out there with the trucks. It's too dangerous! We didn't go far. I don't care. I said no running off! Dad wouldn't have minded! Your dad would have gone with you. Exactly! We're heading out in less than an hour and you guys just couldn't wait. It's not the same, It's bad enough we have to sit and watch you work. Yah, now we have to drag them along with us. We never get to go anywhere. You guys know I have to work. That's the primary reason we came up here! You're always working, and no one's paying us to babysit for you! We just wanted to have some fun like we used to. That's all. Your brother should know better. But Jase, I count on you. You're the oldest, you, know better No more attitude Dom, I mean it, no more! You promised if I'd bring you guys up here you'll engage with them. I don't want to hang out with Pill. You need to call Phil by his name. That boy has enough problems without you making fun of him. Everybody calls him Pill! Do I call him Pill? Does Kyle? [music gently playing] This was dad's camping spot. You're dad, would want us to start over. Dom, Domanic, The good times are not all behind us. Families sometimes change. Your Dad loved this place, and he loved bringing you up here. Can we honor that? Yeah I, I get it, it's a little bit different now but can you at least try to have fun with them, for me? Help me out. Whats to enjoy, with Marli and Pill? They can't ride, their dad doesn't even know how to camp. But he's trying, they're trying for us. Dom, Jase, you and me, we are still a family, Maybe Kyle, Marli, Phil, all of us, maybe we can be a family. The only ones who believe that are you and Kyle, and he's not my dad. [music playing louder] Hey Dom. -Oh, we're leaving? -Umm, hmm. So soon. Great! [music ends] So, I have a great idea. we are all gonna get going. We'd rather stay. We don't have to go all the way, ok? We can stop at Mead Lake and have a picnic. You guys can quad on the trails and Kyle and I can go do the survey. Can we go swimming? That's a great idea! As long as you all get along. Ummh. For pictures and emergency purposes only. Thanks! Got it? Pictures and emergencies. I got it! Hey sport. Jase? Marli knows better, but if you wouldn't mind keeping an extra eye on Phil? Thanks pal. Your mom said I could drive this one. You don't even know how! You manage, it can't be that hard. Hold on boys! Marli! Not so much! Not so much what? Well, everything! Marli. I think I'm getting the hang of it! It s fun! Um, Marli, do you have any more Gravol in the med kit? [upbeat song] [ I see the sun beat down,] [sky so clear] You guys! You guys go ahead. We'll meet you at the lake, okay? [gonna lay right back] Yah! Let's go! [summer is here] [oh, oh, oh oh, ooh] [don't need no rain] [gonna feel the sun] [shinning down over everyone] Hey Marli, I can't hurt my head. [summer fun] [I see the wind blowing the clouds] Pill! Cut it out! [clearing them out] Pill look! It's a deer! [come back my friend when the autumn comes again] Hey, stop! [ but cha got to go right now ] [oh, oh, oh oh, ooh] [dont need no rain] [going to feel the sun] [shinning down over everyone] [gonna feel the breeze] [summer song] Oh, gross! [song ends] I was asking Jase about, maybe going to see that waterfall. He thought it was a good idea. Waterfall? There s not a waterfall around here. Dad's waterfall! Oh! No! Mom? Come on! We're right here. It was Dad's last challenge, The Warriors' Quest. Dom, it is at least seventy miles away and you'll have to go all around the mountain to get there. The roads are blocked off for a reason, to keep people out. Look at me. It's not happening! We could find a way around. It's blocked off! End of story! [music softly playing] Need some help? I'm good. Tannis? Do you think the boys are gonna be alright? They'll be okay. But are they going to be okay? They'll be okay. After the verbal whiplashing my boys got this morning, we'll be good for at least 3 weeks. My boys are, I know them. They, pretend to be all tough, but they're really soft on the inside. How bout you? How are you doing? I'm better when I'm with you. Grab your gear. [music ends] Hey, there's that road to the waterfall. It goes all the way around. What? You guys. You re not going to leave this area. Okay Dom? Okay Jase? Both of you. Dom, pack this up please. [suspenseful music plays] [music ends] Hey you guys, meet us here at seven, no later. Untill then, there is plenty you guys can do. As long you all agree and stick together. Okay? [Kyle] Bye kids! Hey, you wanna skip rocks? Move it along kid. You're bothering me. What do you think you're doing? Places to go and things to see. What places? I'm going to the waterfall. Coming? We know the way now. Is it in the allowed area? Only for the brave and the beautiful. Cool! I wanna go! See! It's seventy miles from here, Two and a half hours there, and two and a half hours back. No Dom! It's just no. We haven't been here in two years, and we followed dad, not these maps. If it's too rough we'll just turn back! Who will know! What if they get back early? They'll probably be out for hours smooching in the woods or something. They're surveying. Don't be disgusting. That's what they all say. He's right. They won't be back until at least dinner. Well, You're not going anywhere without this. Fine! Stare at trees all day, see if I care! He's just upset. He misses our dad. Your dad's not dead, you can still see him right? Their dad doesn't wanna see them. That's why he's so angry. Go skip rocks Pill. Who told you that? Kyle? -Dad said that.-- -It s not true. Look after the divorce, Dad got sick ok? It's not because he doesn't want to see us, He doesn't want us to see him. Got it! Okay. He's sick, that's all. I'm sorry. Just go swim if that's what you want. [music playing softly] I'm really, what I said back there was wrong. Sorry about your dad, must be tough. He didn't leave us much to hold onto, you know? That's why Dom wants to go to the waterfall. If we go, it was the one thing that was ours to do. What's it like? It was great! Always made us feel like we were worth it. He hid something up there for us. Our grandfather's World War II knife. If you ask me, I think he made it up. Anyway, I don't really care anymore. But I know Dom does. He takes things really hard. and Mom just doesn't get it. I'm okay if you wanna go? Yeah? What are they gonna do? Tie us to a stump, break us up, make us all go home? I know I'm going to regret this. [music ends] Did you see where dad put the bear spray? No one said anything about bears. Is it broken? No. Just a starter battery deal. No biggie. [engine starts] [engine revs and then idles] You wanna drive, a broken quad, 70 miles into the bush, where the bears are? Relax Pill. If anyone gets in trouble, it will be me and Dom. I'm not worried about getting in trouble, I'm worried about dying! Marli's going to double with Jase. I'll drive our quad. You re gonna be fine! Just hold on and don't puke. That's what they told C3PO when they strapped him to Chewbacca's back. [red ATV idling] There's no way. They totally blocked it off. Right through there and up. Over those rocks? That bank? Dom, we can't wreck the quads! Sounds like you don't even want to try. Are you listening? I don't want to. Now we can go back to the lake, or we can ride the creek. Or just sit around. Might as well go to the creek. My stomach hurts. I wanna go back. Now is not the time to get soft in the belly. What is that supposed to mean? Hop off for a minute. I'll show you. You're going to get us all in trouble. What are you doing? If I wreck the quad, I'll be in so much trouble that they will pack us up and go home. Don't get killed. Dom! [adventure music] What's with your brother? ADD. [ATV scraping through shrubs] [music ends] Hey losers! Pill! Come on! [upbeat music] bok, bok, bok, bok. If you were twice as smart, you'd be stupid. See you there. If you dare! Well, we're still going to the waterfall right? Yeah, but if Dom could do it. [camera click] [camera click] [camera click] Do one, it ll be funny. It ll be funny. [camera click] One. Two, [camera click] [music quiet] This is amazing. Hey watch it! You're getting too close to the edge. Sometimes you got to be on the edge to see the beauty. [music ends] You know, when you said this was gonna be a work holiday, I didn't think it was going to be more work than holiday. Kyle, I've got a schedule to keep. In fact, if we don t keep going, we're not going to meet our timeline for 7:00 tonight. That's not what I mean. So what do you mean? [music softly playing] I don't like seeing you all stressed out. Kids are struggling, you're not smiling. Welcome to my world, Kyle. You know, your boys look at us like we are some sort of invaders from Mars or something. You are city kids. But is that what Phil and Marli think about us, That we are some kind of aliens? No, no. I mean, they got their own issues going on, I guess. Look. We ve all been through the wringer here. Your family, my family. I don't know how I would've done the last 6 months without you. The kids will see that too. When I was young, every camping trip I ever went on, I hated. Until the end, and then I never wanted to go home. Kids are resilient that way. Now we've gotta get going. -[Kyle] Aw! -[Tanis] Come on. [music ends] [red quad idling] We turn here. Off the road? Don't think we should. I don't remember which one it is. Well I do! It was dad's shortcut. This one! Right here. The road's too long the way around. Let's just stick to it. We know we won't get lost on the road. Yeah, but we might be late and mom will freak out! Oh you know that didn't seem to concern you before! Why take on trouble needlessly, if we can avoid it? And I remember cutting up a trail. This has gotta be it! I know it Jase. Do you hear that? What? It s the river stream. So what does that mean? It leads to the waterfall! We're close, but there's boulders in front of it. Hop off for a second. [green ATV started] No problem. [ATV starts to sputter then dies] What the? Oh no! What's wrong with it? [red ATV idling] I'm out of gas. Didn't you fill up this morning? Yes I filled it! What did I say? What? Dingleberry's trashed it going past the gate! You ripped the line! It s been leaking fuel the whole way. Stop calling me names hemorrhoid, snot wad, monkey face retard! What's a Hemorrhoid? Shut up muttonhead! Can't we just, patch it up, give them some gas and go back? We're at half a tank. If we split the fuel, neither quad will make it back. Get off the quad. What are you doing? Calling my dad. What for? Don't call. They'll be mad enough when we ride up on one quad. I don't want them on slow burn until we get there. The waterfall is just up the, Oh no! we're going back now! This close? What are you, mom now? Five minutes ago, you were for it. Five minutes ago, we didn t have four riders on one quad. You're not the boss. I am the boss! Forget the waterfall. It's over. You scum sucking, flea lip, cheese head, snotsicle! If we're already this close, I mean we're already in hot water. We don't even know where this trail goes. Dom just needs to let it go. Should've just said no this morning. What was I thinking? You were thinking of your brother. He can't choose to let it go. If he's holding on, it's because he needs to. He'll let go when he's ready. What are you, a therapist? My mom died last year. I think I know a bit about it. Alright. If we're going, we're taking the road and I'm driving. Pill, let s go! Look at this worm! [Jase] Oh great. [Jase] He's sitting in the posion ivy. Maybe it wasn't a worm. Maybe it was some kind of alien larvae! I saw this movie where alien larvae reproduced by crawling into your ear. Marli, there is one in your hair... Talking will only make it itch more. [camera click] [camera click] Ahhhh! [brakes sqreach] Marli, are you ok? Ah, guys!! [ATV idling] My leg! Guys?! Ow! Oh! Sorry about that. [pat on helmet] No, no, no! It's gonna be ok, it's gonna be ok. It's gonna be ok! It's pooched. Just leave it. The battery's cracked, you don't need a burn on top of everything else. Keep the sim card. Guys. I think I hear something! [waterfall in distance] It's the waterfall. Come on, let's go! Get on! [ATV idling] Yeah! We did it! I got it! It was there all along. Grandpa s knife. We passed dad's challenge! We came and we conquered! I'm impressed! Is it worth something? Quiet Pill! We gotta keep moving, we don't want to waste anymore gas. Let him have his moment. [engine turned off] Up top! Pill, what did you do? You said! You said we need to conserve gas! Ohhhhh. Is there a pull start? No. What if somebody walks down the road and grabs the other battery? I already checked. Both batteries are bolted in tight. We can't unscrew them. Maybe we can push start it! It's an automatic. Well, we better start walking. That's it? That's our only option? Unless you can hail us a taxi?! How far out are we? You said before, we were 70 miles? And that's to the lake. It's 80 or so to the base camp. We can't walk that far. Let's just stay here. They'll come for us. Oh, like they'll look for us way out here? Dom talked about going to the waterfall, they'll figure it out. But when?! Mom forbid it! When will they know we're even out here or that we're missing? This could be the last place they look. This could be the only place they look. If we're going to stay out here, most of the gear is back with the green quad. So, we make it back to the other quad. What then? It's still out of gas. How're they gonna find us? [adventure music] Empty these bottles, I have an idea. Whoever carries this, remember, this one doesn't have a cap, so be careful. Got the fuel line? Got it. [music ends] I think you should carry them. Allright. Are we walking the road back to the green quad? That's still a long way. What about Dom's shortcut? Yah! The green quad is down there. Probably an hour, an hour and a half if we cut through. [upbeat song] It's better than the road! As long as we don't get lost. The waterfall cuts through the forest, as long as we follow the sound of water, it'll lead us right there. -[Jase] Let's go, -[Dom] Let's go! [Jumped the bridge and swam the river] [take a walk in winter meadows] [find a place to sit and wallow] [you feel so alive] [Here's to be free my, my heart's my home] [and here's to be free my, my heart's my own] [song ends] Kyle! Honey! Can you get me another one of those markers please? Another one? That s only 2,222,222 of them. Can we go back and get the kids now? We'll go soon. I'll hurry, Okay? -Owe! -Kyle! I'm Okay! Ahhh! Ah! Tanis! Ahhh! oogh! Sorry! You alright? Oh! Ok, you know what, I'm going to call Jase. Okay? He'll come and get us. Jase doesn't have a phone. Marli does. No, she doesn't. Remember I took it from her this morning. and I gave it back to her this morning. Don't be mad at me. She only uses it for a camera and taking pictures and now for emergency purposes which makes this perfect, doesn't it? OK buster. Ok put your head back. I guess that kinda makes sense. Hey there's no service out here. We're going to have to go to a different location. Well, since your so good at cleaning up my messes, I'm confident your going to get me out of this one, right? Okay, alright, first things first, Let's get you down there, grab the emergency kit and I'll wrap you all up. Okay? Come on. Where on earth is it!? It could be further after all? Take a break for a second. Is it just me or is this taking too long? How do we know the creek really connects. I mean it could branch off anywhere. We've been zig zagging all day. Do you smell gas? Oh no. Looks like ya lost one. It's leaked all over. We still got three. Pill, take that over to the water and wash it out. That really stinks. We could make a bee line straight down the mountain. You're worried about the wrong trail and now you want to go off? We could be back to the supplies and on the road home in a fraction of the time. I can't get a clear fix. It's a short walk. Besides, the road runs along the bottom. We can't miss it. [suspenseful sound] [upbeat music] You did it! We did it. [music ends] Pill, that water has to last. I'm hungry. Four apples, three cinnamon buns, one package of marshmallows, and two large packages of Fig Newtons. Fig Newtons! Yah, Fig Newtons. Fig Newtons. Let's get to work. Yah, I'd say that s had it. We got gas but I don't see the fuel line. It's not here. Check all your pockets. Check everything! We're screwed. We must have dropped it somehow. What do we do now? We can't walk seventy miles back to base camp. There's something else. What? Pill only has enough insulin for a couple more injections. That's it. That's twelve hours maybe. The roads to here and the camp are on opposite sides of a ridge. Well, we don't exactly have the right maps, but We're here, the camp is just off a road that's about here. It will take way too long to walk if we follow the road, but it's not that bad if we go straight. What's not that bad? It's four or five miles through some pretty rough terrain. And we won't make it tonight, but we'll finish by morning. Otherwise, we're talking seventy clicks just to get back to the gate. Or we can wait to get rescued? They'll never find us here. [music playing softly] We licked the mountain already, what's another four or five miles? Besides we get to camp out under the stars. Dom, Pill, grab some gear. The first aid kit, the water, the snacks, the rope. If you ask me, the odds to our survival are thirteen million, four hundred thousand and twenty six to one. You ever camp overnight in the wild? I slept in my backyard, once. Right, I watch Discovery Channel. When this is all over, I have a house plant I'd like to introduce you to. Not to worry. Camping out can be fun. No adults, roasting marshmallows, telling ghost stories. Ghosts? Uhhh, don't worry about it. [music ends] It's already past eight. We told them to meet us at seven. Where could they have gone? Well we are late hun. Maybe they just went back to camp. Jase! Dom! [Kyle] I'm gonna call Marli Huh? What? I have reception, but the call's not going through. I think we got to go back to camp. Wow man. You look like sausage with the skin peeled off. Does it hurt? I don't have my medication. That pink stuff? There's more. Your pills? What do you take them for? My energy goes up and down. My biggest thing is the asthma. I think your biggest thing is sausage skin. You must be really allergic. Have you ever had it before? I've told you, I've never been out in the bush before. Jase! Dom! Philip! Marli! They haven't come back yet. Phil's other medication is still here. Maybe they went out looking for us. Okay, Now I'm getting worried. Let's go check with the neighbors. [distant howling] [night sounds] It's a meteor! It s a meteor! That reminds me of something. The eyes of the red haired bear. That's just what they look like. Burnt dead with his rage at the people who would trespass his forest. [eerie sounds] He didn't kill anyone last year, or the year before. But three years ago, a group of hikers, four of them, went hiking through these very woods. On their hike they came to a mighty tree, high on the tree, they saw deep cuts made by the claws of the great, great bear. The cuts were how he marked his territory. and all the animals in the wood respected and feared the bear. But the hikers didn't. They pitched a camp and cut sticks off the mighty tree and they burned up the dry wood the tree had shed and destroyed the silence of the forest with their own loud songs while the darkness, fell around them. They went to sleep in the lean-to they had made and dreamed of the fun they had had. And all the while, the great bear watched from the black, black night his eyes so dark and dull Tell them the rest Dom. It's just so horrible. When they were all asleep, the bear came out of the darkness And fell upon their lean-to with a fury borne of madness. It broke their bones and tore them to shreds. The ones that got away had no choice but to crap their pants [long fart] as they ran. Oh gosh, you pig! Ah, green tomatoes, fig newtons. [eerie sounds end] The smell was so intense it tracked them all down. When it left the clearing in the early morning light, it had eaten so much blood, that it's hair was as red as it's teeth and claws. I always thought that was just a scary story, until earlier today, when I saw a flash of red moving through the trees. Okay stop it. Shut up! Was it the bear? I don't know. We didn't stop to find out. Probably why we're still alive. [coyoties howling in the distance] Oh great. That can't be good. Don't worry. They won't come near the fire. Especially with stinky over here. Just the same. I trust you guys will stand guard tonight. I'm going to sleep, try and distance myself as much as possible from today. I just confirmed with the ranger, They want us to just sit tight and hope that they come back Look, I just don t want to sit here either They took the maps. Stupid. I should have clued in Dom had my bag. He was planning this all along. Planning what? He wanted to go to the waterfall. Here. They'll be somewhere around here. Jase wouldn't get lost. And Dom knows how to handle himself. That's not reassuring. I'm not going to bet my kids' lives on that. We have to let them know. We will let them know, I will let them know. I'm not waiting for any search party, come morning, I'm going out after them. [Grizzly grunt] [Grizzly huff] [Grizzly grunt] [Grizzly quiet snarl] [Grizzly huffing] [Grizzly puffs air] [Grizzly snarl] AHHHHHHH! It's the red haired bear! [Loud grizzly growl] [Loud grizzly growl] [Loud grizzly growl] [Marli] Pill? Let's get out of here! Are you going to try and get some sleep? I can't Tanis. I can't sleep. I don't know why I believed they would be all right out there. The boys I can understand, but Marli, why she'd have to run off like that? Maybe she just wanted to get along. She knows better than that, she's smarter than that. I just can't believe she'd fall for that nonsense. I see. You think you know my boys that well hey? That's not what I'm saying. You know that. I should have just listened to my own instincts. Which were what? Maybe were just moving too fast. Maybe our families are just too different. I don t know, you tell me. What was all that, the kids will be resilient and they ll adapt? I was trying to be positive for you, for your kids Kyle, because I love you! My kid's the one that's sick Tanis! He's eleven years old, he's a diabetic, he's allergic to everything. He could die out there Do you get it! I get that, but why did you bring him up here then! Nobody twisted your arm. I wanted them to get along. We, we didn't think this through. If anything happens to any one of our kids, I'm sorry I brought you up here. Really, I, I'm sorry. [grizzly grunts in the distance] [wind howling through trees] Pill! Dom! Dom! Dom! Dom, You alright? Yah, I'm good. You see them? You can walk? Ok let's go, we got to find them. Let's go. Pill! Pill! [Jase] Marli! [Dom] Pill! [Jase] Marli! Pill! Pill! Pill! [Marli] I thought you were gone. Did it get Jase and Dom? [Marli] Jase? [Jase] It's us. [Jase] Are you okay? We got to get out of here. Yeah but we need to stay together. Let's go, come on. [cheerful music] I'm not waiting for any search party. I'm going out after them. We can, we can both go. No you stay here. You can't ride a quad right now. Kyle it's just a strained muscle. I love you. I'm doing this. Okay. Okay. Kyle I know. I know. [music fades] It's not that bad, just don't scratch. Marli, it's driving me nuts. I need my medication. We're working on it. Just wait here a sec. Why did we leave the road? Jase is trying to find the way back to last night's camp. So we can backtrack? I think just to find our direction. What if the bear's still there? Don't think the worst. We can't spend all day looking. Pill's allergies, it's just going to get worse. Well if we find the camp, they'll be medicine. It's not working. That's, roughly, where we were going. We can't just walk off into the bush. Your his friend. Don't you want him to get help too? I don't even know what side of our camp out we wound up on. You're going to be alright, Pill. Just hang on a little bit longer. Okay. It s ready to go. You have your cell right? Yes. Okay you call me, call me if there's an emergency, or if you find the kids. When I find them. -When you find them.-- -All right. I'm okay! We can just, go another way. How far do we have to back track for that? Let's just find another way around. With Pill and your ankle, we may never find a bridge like this for miles, if at all. We climb across and in two minutes we're on the other side. This really, really freaks me out guys. I mean, Pill can t even swim. There's big rocks underneath. He's not going to drown. Look we'll just go slow and take our time. I don't want to take my time! I don't want to do it! Marli, Pill's only going to get worse. Look at me. You can do this. I'll go if you go. All right, let's just get it over with. Okay, should be a turn off with a gate up ahead. Think Kyle think. [Truck in the distance] Oh Oh! [RV honking horn] [sounds of frustration] Ahhhh! [suspenseful sounds building] Come on Pill. You're almost there. Just keep looking straight ahead, nice and easy. Just keep going. Don't look down. Don't look down, right? Marli, you're going to make it. Just go faster! I'm falling! Help! Don't drop me Jase, don't drop me! Stop moving! [music] [pants rip] Ahh man! You got to be kidding me. [music fades] Finally! Are those bear tracks? No bears! No bears! These tracks are old. Wouldn't worry bout them. Let me see. Are you okay? He's swelling bad. Can't be out here much longer. Let's see that map. There's no creek. It's tiny. And we're past this. We must have gone four miles, don't you think? We must have, well, I think so. Not far now then. Not far now, guys. Let's move. But if there was only one food, that's all you can eat, forever. Bacon. That means no more pie, ever, ever again. No cake. No chocolate milk. No ice cream. Ever. Crispy apple wood smoked bacon. I don't think you understand. The smell is like invisible fairies sent to wake you after a deep, deep, sleep. Oh yah! What about those fresh little donuts, that get rolled in sugar, there just gone! But bacon, the taste explodes in your mouth like a bomb of Dead pig. Have you eaten lemon pie, from? What is that? Deer, I think. Must have been sick or something. With what, a flesh eating disease? I mean for a bear to kill it, but not eat it. Or finish eating it. Why say bear? Could have been wolves or coyotes? Cause grizzlies don't eat their prey fresh. They bury them, and come back when they're rotten. Why do you think they say to play dead? Why do they eat it rotten? It's a delicacy in some countries. I dare you to eat some. That's disgusting. Come on, I'll give you five bucks if you eat a piece of that deer. How much of it? It's more dried than rotten. That is sick. You're sick! Five dollars to the first person who eats a piece of that deer. I'm not eating it! [Dom] Ahhh! Ah! I smell like bear bait! But did you eat any? You look like a pizza with the cheese ripped off. Bite me! Let's not wait around to be second course. Okay kids where are you, where are you? [ATV in distance] That's Jase's quad Jase! Phil! Marli! Dom! Jase! Kyle? Tanis? Tanis, can you hear me? I hear you. Did you find them? I found one of the quads. But they're not here. How'd you, How did you not see them? How did they get by you? They didn't take the road. [Kyle] The only thing I can think of is that they hiked up over the ridge. You tell them to go south of the waterfall, you hear me? Kyle, apparently there's a forest fire about 100 miles south, Everything's tied up. You just tell them we need more help okay! Okay? Just, just come back to camp.Okay? I got to go. Tanis? This is it, Pill. Over the ridge and we'll see the road. Where's the road? Where's the road? Where's the camp? It's not his fault. You said you knew where we were going. I said I didn't know. [Dom] Now what? The road we were going to connect to, didn't run all the way through the forest. I mean, if we didn't get it right, we can miss it completely. We're a ways off. Your mom's looking for us, and my dad. Yeah, I think we're way past the point of being in trouble, don't you? You did your best Jase. We probably put the kibosh on this new family deal. Dad would be really proud of us that we found this. Screw the knife! If anyone is to blame here it's you for getting us into this mess. We almost got killed, Pill could die. You never think of anyone but yourself. You think I don't care if Pill dies? Huh? Is that what you really think? Well I do, and you're an idiot! I see what's happening here. We have a little sleep over in the woods with the new family, and now Dad doesn't mean anything anymore! Dad was a drunk. Shut your mouth! Dad got sick! It wasn't his fault! Dom get back here! Leave me alone! [inspirational music] Dom and Jase If your reading this it's because you completed your second to last challenge. I'm so proud of both of you and always have been, despite of the things I've said, especially to you Dom. If there is any forgiveness in your heart, love me enough not to repeat my mistakes. If you can, learn from them. I want you know how much I believe in you. No matter how hard things get, you lift your heads high and keep them there. Never let fear and pride steal away your hearts like it did mine. Be wise. Be compassionate. Protect those who cannot protect themselves. Be men of courage in the face of despair. Love irrespective of danger. This is what a warrior is and my final challenge to you. My heart will always be with you though your darkest days, and in my joy will I celebrate your triumph. Be strong my sons. My beloved sons. With all my heart and soul, Your Father. [music fades] How are you? Just thinking. I'm interested. [inspirational music] Do you ever wonder whether any of this has a reason? You mean, our stupidity for coming out here? I saw you grab onto that cross last night. Do you really think that's going to protect you from what happens out here in the wild? This mountain doesn't care whether we live or die. She gave it to me. It reminds me to never give up and never lose faith no matter what gets thrown at us. But when you hope and it doesn't make a difference. It all just makes me angry. Parents make me angry. You sound like my Dad. He got angry, looking for someone or something to blame it on. He even blamed it on my mom for leaving us. My Mom and Dad were always fighting about stuff that didn't matter. There were times I just wanted him to die. I'm sorry. After the divorce he was out drinking one night, got himself in a car wreck. Now he can't walk. He s not in the hospital. He's in prison. One of the last things she told me, was to live my life and never take anything for granted. She meant well but it scared me. Why? Like she knew something I didn't. And then one day she's gone and I'm alone and I realized I took her for granted. I understand. Do you really? Cause it seems like there might be a chance for you and your dad. Your right, the wilderness is brutal, but, it's, also beautiful. Sometimes life has a way of shining light on what really matters, what's worth holding onto. Maybe somewhere in this is a gift and we just can't see it now. That's why I hold onto it. It reminds me. Otherwise, it just doesn't make any sense to me. But we're going to make it out of here. All of us. No one's getting left behind. Not even Dom. [music fades] This is bad. Dad had a poison ivy reaction once. If it gets into your bloodstream it can cause swelling from the inside. My eye hurts. What's in the med pac? We have gauze, and tape, and a fork. That'll help. We can't stay here, we need to keep moving. Back to the same question. Which way? When I was down there I found a small stream. It's maybe two hundred yards from here. Here, take this, I got to get him some water Figure out where we need to go huh. I'm sorry I was such an idiot. No need. I made the choice to come here. I think I'm the bigger idiot. Can we just find a way to get home. Is that better? Here, have a drink. Come on. We should probably just go to the beach next year. Sunburn. I think you should see this. It was in the knife all along. North, and South. South, South-West. I was off. We both must have been a little over-correcting in our heads. Got to be close to the road, I remember this river. How are you? [sounds of wasps swarming] Guys be careful, I think there's a wasps nest. Pill, we don t have his EPI kit! He's allergic! One sting could kill him! Come on! [suspenseful music] Come on! Come on, get up! Keep moving! Come on! [wasp sounds fading] [bone cracking] What happened? Is it broken? Ahhh! Ahh! [music fades] Is it broken? [Jase] Ahh! [Jase] I'll be fine. You don't look fine. You need to get Pill to the base camp. Get him to the road. You know the way Dom. We can't leave you. We could splint your leg, Don't bother. I can wait. It's a long way back. He'll be too awkward to carry. But if you can drag him on a travois, that'll be faster for you and easier on him. A what? It's like a stretcher. Give me your hoody. Howdy! Hi, I'm Kyle Simmons. Two of my kids were the ones that went missing along with my fiancee's kids. Have you heard anything? Can I see some I.D. please? Are you kidding me! I'm the father! Okay, you can calm it down a little bit. This is Simpson, looks like we have the kid's father ahh, out here at the main gate. You heard anything? Well, we've sent our own people up to have a look, little more experienced, some local guides, we even have a ranger up there. Okay, so your not getting my messages, I told everyone, you got to go south of that location, they went up and over the ridge. Mister Simmons, we think it's in the kid's best interest if we start up at the waterfall. Well unless we get a chopper in that sky right now, my kids gonna die so can we please just do something about it! Okay, calm down, Jedd's our local pilot. He's fightin a fire down in Durrum County. He's going to be here within the hour. Now you wife's right in here, She needs some calming down herself, Why don't you head in and talk to her. Where does this road go?
