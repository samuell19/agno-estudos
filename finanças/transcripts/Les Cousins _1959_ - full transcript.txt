- So where are you going? 11 Rue des Sycamores, Neuilly-sur-Seine - "Neuilly" for short - Looking for someone? - I'm looking for Monsieur Paul Thomas I might have known: the procession's starting. Are you his cousin? His father is your father's brother? Monsieur Henri's also a brother? - You know everything! - Seventh floor on the left. I clean for Monsieur Paul; he's nice. - You're Charles, I bet - Let him approach. May he be welcome and make himself at home Did he travel well? Is he happy? - Very happy - Do you like the lavish surroundings? All these trophies? All these guns? He's a good friend. His name is Jean, I believe, known as Clovis because he has political ambitions like the famed King of the Franks "No further, Frank!" our forbearers cried I've lost the rhythm - Piss off forsooth - Don't you start. We're not impressed are we? - Rustic! - Eat, drink and shut the hell up Die Kuche. In French, the kitchen, where one toys with tasty dishes I'll show you around Up there, the loggia, with my bed Some trophies... Uncle Henri's horns - Where is he? - Flying between New York and Miami - With a bird? - Two birds Eat and shut the hell up A little corridor with a door opening onto a nice, sober, tidy little room Your room - It's very nice Uncle Henri doesn't stint himself He has a place like this in every capital - Mum says he's into shady deals - Your mother does? - You know what I think? Your dad and mine, they're the dopes Say Paul... Who's that guy? Out there? That's Clovis But he must be at least thirty More. He's a good sort What does he do for a living? - Oh you'll see A bit of this and that. He's very nice I'm surprised your mother let you come She wouldn't have if I hadn't been staying here - You're all in order at the university; I've got you signed in That's your bed I'll get my case - Yes, it?s Clovis Ok, I?ll call him It's Genevieve So what? It's your problem Charles has arrived... my cousin Yes, Clovis is here She's coming round - Is she now? Excuse me, but I?m often uncouth I'm sorry but this girl is coming... she and I had a thing last winter She's got problems, silly bitch - I'm tired, think I?ll go to bed How tactful. Don't you admire our friend's tact Very much - Aren't you tired too? - Not at all, I?m looking forward to this - Did you understand? - You know I took English - It means goodnight - You should do German instead of law Dear mother. The journey here went very well I had the compartment to myself, so I could stretch out on the seat Don't worry, I took off my shoes and then put them on to go to the dining car There was quite a good choice but I missed Marie's cooking However the Escalope Saganaise wasn't at all bad For you, I think - There's no doubt about it now. I don't know what to do The doctor confirmed it this morning - Do your parents know? - I told them - Clever girl I didn't mention you, but daddy kept on at me, so... And you a liberated woman? Don't make fun of her I'm not. So what did daddy say? He walked out and left me to it Don't worry, I can fix you up; a little bit of unpleasantness and that's it -I don't want that -Do you have a choice? It's best, you know -Paris is wonderful, and Paul seems in his element here Love, Charles Rise and shine! It's one of the treasures of the arsenal -What's this? -A deadly weapon, when loaded -It doesn't look like it -Never judge by appearances Get up you sluggard; hurry and get dressed I'm going to show you around Paul took me to the Latin Quarter, to a sort of club called the Union Piss off, I'm going to work! -Leaving just as I arrive? -I'm off to the Elysee -About Genevieve, it's all set -You're a real friend, Clovis Come along; I'm introducing my cousin to the delights of our little bordello Gilbert not about darling? Behold and be amazed Let us venture to the infernal regions I'm pissed; pour me a drink and make me forget True it's stupid. Pour You are drunk, Philippe -Stop him drinking -No, I was complimenting him That looks like Francoise Starting to wallow, are we? -Problems with Francoise? _As you can see I could give you some proverbial advice -I know all the proverbs -You're drunk enough to ignore them We haven't met, but we have now You can help a grieving friend I'm conceited but you'll like me, Ernestine -I doubt it, but my name's Martine -Martine, how delightful Like a bell sounding the cocktail hour My grieving friend has been ditched by an equally delightful little creature But your smile is going to make him all better again Philippe, let me introduce Martine Don't let him get you down; boys aren't everything Good music, literature, the dance and no matches May I? I'm Paul's cousin Charles I'm Vonvon I'm going to finish the signs He's busy, I see Mind me watching? Are you the cousin...Paul's cousin? I hear you're hot stuff at bridge. You take my place after this hand The rest are mine -Shit, one down -It wasn't on The heart finesse was a mistake He had to have the king I'm the king! Do something to help me. This young lady says she has a class -She's crazy -I have to go, really -Yes, come on Martine -How dare the varlet? Dost he take thee for his chattel? Are you forgetting that you love me? -I'll be back before long By your troth? Take heart, fellow Ah, women -I thought you meant her for Philippe -Oh Philippe is me in a way I think Philippe's sulking I just mention it because I like to keep him happy But don't let it bother you It's all yours Ok, I get it How goes it, baby? -You don't look like Paul -We're cousins, not twins Like actors...cut out for different roles by your looks -What system do you play? -Whatever you like Blackwood, four trumps or no trumps? -Four no-trumps. You use forcing bids? Not very well It's a question of practice -No bid -One spade -Two hearts -Three clubs Four spades Not playing anymore? What scheme are you hatching? Who's she? Florence? She has something, despite the name I can press your suit; fresh meat finds favour with the ladies The Figaro in me is roused Meet my cousin You're the famous cousin? Cousin, maybe, but I?m the famous one! I must dash; I just came to see Vonvon -See you soon? -Of course Sorry about that Why be sorry? I'm off -Can I help you? -I'm just looking -First editions? Latest arrivals? -I'm not a collector -Thrillers? -I don't like them much I'm delighted. What, then? Balzac, maybe -You're a provincial? -Does it show? Not really, except in reading Balzac at your age -What do the rest read? -Thrillers, that's all they want I showed one Old Gorroit. He almost flung it at me Yes, thrillers and sex stuff For relaxation, they say -You sound hopeless -With good reason A lifetime isn't enough with all there is to read, yet they waste their time You're right; ten years I?ve been reading and I love it I tell them Dostoyevsky has all they want but they can't be bothered -You sound bitter -Why not, with no sale for Balzac? I like you; choose yourself a Balzac on me Thanks, but I can pay I'll make it up on the pulps The pleasure I'd get is worth more to me, anyway. Go on, make your choice You've read Lost Illusions? Steal it then Go on, I'm not looking You'll bankrupt yourself Don't worry about that Your eyes are still full of wonders you've read But it's an odd world we live in; you'll see Maybe, but it is the world -If you can stand it We were talking about books You broke up the game -Your brother? -No, cousin Dear Mother. The great thing is that I don't have to take notes in class Each week I buy duplicated copies of the lectures and study them at home I find it much easier to work that way Tomorrow I'm having a day off, though Paul has invited some friends to "a little soiree", as he says Wait a second Shit, are we the first? And shit to you too! You can make your own introductions Shutting me out? Where's the bar? That sniveling Philippe -How are things? -She's dumped Andre; Auguste'll be next I'm off Let's sit down -They make me sick -Not me You'll learn -Why so bitter Philippe? -I don't know -There are other girls -The problem is, I love Francoise Yes, but....from what Paul says... She's a tart; I know Some music? Can we dance? -Music, please, not Wagner -God preserve me from dolts Francoise! I don't want to see her -Who's that with her? -Rameau; I know him vaguely You're Paul's cousin? Have a drink, Rameau, old fellow -No kiss for me? -By your leave, Rameau -Rameau doesn't care -Unsociable, isn't he? But fundamentally sound; that rude, rustic upbringing, you know Piss off and get your drink -What's got into you? -I just don't like him -That's no reason -It is...I'm not very civilised -I've been waiting for you -Paul told me I've been waiting for you ever since... well for a long time -I like sitting on staircases; do you? -I love it What I said about waiting for you... that was true Forgive this intrusion You're very welcome I told you before to keep out of my way It's not healthy for you here. Run away and teach yourself to read What's got into you? -That should make you welcome -A modest bottle -You're very gallant -And eager to prove it The Count's a bit of a rogue... ...but exceptionally generous I can afford to be An Italian friend, Count Arcangelo Minerva -Delighted to make your acquaintance -Welcome to our festivities -Not bad, eh? -Delightful Ah, Paris... Who's he? Times are hard An Italian friend here on business, but also seeking a little relaxation Taking care of the after-dinner entertainment is my job Age bows before beauty What's your cut? Your sandwiches won't keep me going, dear Here's Genevieve I hope I'm welcome You know I'm fond of you It was a false alarm, you know You've both been very kind; pride yourselves on being true friends How about a drink, old pal? Has anyone asked if you modeled for Correggio? -Who's Correggio? -A friend of mine Pretty little tadpole Mozart finishes... ...and now, Wagner! Oh mother mine, where art thou? I am a poor soldier, alone... ...all alone, bereft of friends... ...or comrades Where are they? All are dead. All is dead I am heavy-hearted. I weep. I wail Help me! Mama... No one hears... I am still alone One day, though, the war ends And spring returns again The birds sing. The sun shines Music can be heard And love is born No knight-errantry, please; It's dangerous Behave, Philippe! -Let's go -Should we? Stop making scenes, Philippe; I'm free to do as I like -You make me sick -You go to hell You can all go to hell! What are you staring at me for? I hope you all die like dogs! Absolutely crazy! Too many problems, and not enough character to handle them What's so funny? Nothing. I was thinking about Philippe and what you said Because I'm not sure about myself, whether I've the capacity... ...to be what I'd like to be See, I?m even talking like a book Not at all What do you think of me? That I'm the teacher's pet? -I wasn't in your class -Luckily, or I'd have no chance You don't know what I am A boy doted on and made a fuss of by his mother That leaves its mark At least it's better than the stigma of drink; like Clovis But Clovis faces life with a strength I lack Not that I'm weak, but... Am I a fool? Look at me Do I have a stupid face? Do I say stupid things in a stupid way? I do, don't I? You've a lovely voice, Charles You're not joking? But Paul's much nicer... I meant what I said Say something, so I can say the same to you No, you say something, anything I don't know what to say....I never do Say anything, recite your lecture notes There's something I'm dying to say, but I'd cut my tongue out first I daren't tell you No, it would just provide an occasion to plumb new depths of stupidity But Charles, that's every woman's wish. Recite it to me Never Are you really so dumb? On that point, absolutely I can hear Paul saying: "So we write poems in secret, do we?" Paul isn't here. Tell me your poem I'll think it for you, without saying anything -Is it good? -Very good Charles My collected works, a bit rustic in inspiration In love or not, I'm still a country boy Have you been in love often? Two or three times. You? With this Rameau? Of course not, He's just a friend I'm not much for "just friends" I love you Florence. I find this Rameau repellent You love me? This is very sudden I know, but...that's how I am What's worse is that it stays with me a long time My mother didn't want me to come to Paris; she knows me Paul managed to persuade her, but she said: "The first girl that comes along will get her hooks into you" She sees all women as wicked She kept a jealous eye on me. I had no defenses, she used to say She'd be jealous of you ,too; she already was when I left Would you like to go for a drive? Will you wait while I get the car keys? -Can you drive? -Mother taught me Paul, it's your cousin Can I borrow the car keys? Silly geese! I want a woman and I'll get one The man's mad I'll get one You lied to me; you promised me girls I want girls Just one, for God's sake When they won't, they won't, Arcangelo You want girls, but I want money Rich bastards! Paul, give me the car keys Ah, that's a great idea. Listen to me, you lot How about going for a drive? Come on, it'll be fun You're finished, Arcangelo To the cars! I'll get the keys to the Italian's Nash I need to powder my nose I'll take you, Florence Come on Charles, there's room in my Nash Left behind? Come with me for a change I'm going to drive like the devil. My car will do 120, 130... ...180 kilometres an hour, if I?m on form My head goes through! We'll head for the motorway, by way of the Bois -Where's first gear? -Who cares? Which idiot left the lights on? He's well gone Terrorize him Get up! Gestapo! What's the matter? Having nightmares? I dozed off Had you going, didn't I? -Where have you been? -All over, with the girls -They made a scene in a night club -You went to La Goulee? I'd better go. Is the metro running yet? You're a bit late for the first train Paul...you scared me He seems strange...I don't get it Don't get what? I don't know. I think you really scared him Marc's Jewish, so it shook him up a bit Poor guy, it must have been a real shock You think so? No, it just sobered him up a bit He won't sober up that easily That cretin might have hurt somebody Just as well there's no ammo No? Come and see Take offa da dress lady, or Arcangelo he gonna blowa da top! Have you got Florence's phone number? I forgot to ask her for it Has she a phone? She's never at home Sorry...have to go. We'd better try to get an hour or two's sleep Permit me to sympathise. That's the best thing for it Your humble servant You find me greatly embarrassed No, I insist. I behaved very badly I was too drunk, and I apologise A little merry, perhaps; the life and soul of the party All this was my doing I don?t know how to apologise... all these lovely things in pieces Do you have my friend Delbecque's address? -Delbecque...Clovis? -Yes, I would like to thank him He moves around a lot; I don't have his new address Never mind, I'll find him. We know a bar... Well, with renewed apologies, I'll say goodbye The tenants have been complaining about the noise Good for them Forgive us; your charming city is to blame What a nice man. A foreigner? Yes, Italian, and not as nice as you think My goodness, look at this. Were you fighting? It was Babylon, Madame And your lovely Italian was mainly responsible Where am I going to start? And people complaining too! They were all cordially invited The phone off the hook too Sleep well? The phone was off the hook? -Someone might have called me -They'll call back Were you at this orgy too, Charles? He dipped a toe in Feel alright? -Some Alka-Seltzer, or something? -No I'll be OK Be nice and put on some coffee, Charles -I'm not nice -You tell him, Charles Shame on you, setting cousin against cousin like that I'm hungry too Don't just sit by the phone. Make coffee Do me a favour Paul; piss off The poor boy is in a bad mood Not the very best Florence? It's me....yes, Charles I was worried... Anyway, it's nice of you to call So you do have a phone Listen...can I see you? You say when I've a class this afternoon No, Florence, I have to go I have to put in an appearance, or... All right, let's do that; then we can walk back together When is your class? Three o'clock I'll be out around five. Is that all right? Thanks for calling You don't need to sleep -Who were you calling? -Charles The kid? I'm meeting him at three It's unbelievable It's wonderful; I'm meeting Florence at five He isn't here, he's gone out. He went off to his class But we were supposed to go together No, you were to meet him at five -Well, come in and have a drink -The thing is...I haven't much time Oh come on, you've two hours What's this business with Charles? -What are you playing at?-Just playing Well, at least you're frank What do you get out of it? With Charles? It's not possible He's my cousin, and I'm very fond of him, but after all... After all what? You know him -Yes...so? -You don't get it? Talking about art, fine But in bed... You don't get it; he doesn't think about that -About what? -Bed -So what do you get out of it? -Bed isn't everything Come off it Paul, I want to love him Let's try to be serious. How old are you? Twenty Now consider this: you want to love him; suppose you make it He, for his part, adores you What happens? You start living together, at your place, so that I won't be in your way He'll be studying hard You'll keep house... ...or get someone in to do it for you, while you stay in bed all day reading ...books he chooses for you Saturday night, a movie Sunday afternoon, I'll invite you out for a drink, but he'll have work to do You'll want to stay in with him, but I know you In spite of ourselves, you'll get your martyred look. I'll laugh up my sleeve Besides which, there's his mother What will she say? He won't dare write to her because he can't lie He used to lecture me when we were kids Don't get me wrong, though; he's a good sort, a really nice guy Let's try to be clear about this, Florence He's pretty good looking, much tougher than he looks He's far from a fool; he has, I must insist, an admirable mind But you're just not suited to each other That's what you won't see I'm telling you this for your own good; you'd be desperately unhappy Leave me alone You'd be unfaithful The other one! -I've an empty stomach -Come in and have a drink You here? She came looking for Charles What for? -She wants to love him -Really, that's unbelievable So, I was telling her Can't you just see it? You'd die of boredom after three days of housework That's not for you to decide Has he convinced you? You don't understand You fool You sleep with half the neighbourhood... ...then fall for a virgin... What you're doing is morally reprehensible You're passing yourself off as something you're not Screw him or leave him alone You bastards You hear that, Paul? We're very fond of you, Florence darling. We want to help you -Don't we Paul? -Absolutely We really do Sleep with him if you want, but don't play games No marriage talk I'm serious That's the problem Look at yourself Can you make him happy? Feel your skin...I'm a connoisseur Leave me alone That's the skin of a cock-teaser I know That thrills you, doesn't it? You're made for caresses, not higher feelings Listen to him It's good advise She's listening all right -Aren't you, Florence? -I've two hours to waste I won't need them for my evidence Contact with Charles' skin must seem pretty unnatural, don't you think? Frankly, how do you feel about Charles' skin? Leave me alone Wrong number Try mine Or Paul's? No, Clovis... Go on, try it Let her touch your skin Feels good, doesn't it? Paul's skin is responsive It's something else again Paul's the one to save you from Charles, Florence Love one another , my lambs -Waiting for someone -Have you seen Florence? -Any news of Philippe?-He's OK, more or less -Did something happen to him? -Haven't you heard? He broke his legs jumping from a window Because of Francoise That's sad news She led him on a hell of a dance Twenty past five... I'll wait a little longer -See you at the cafe? -I hope not Here he is Don't worry I waited two hours for you, Florence What happened? I mistook the time -It doesn't matter -It does; I hate letting people down You're forgiven Listen to me, Charles... What is it? You won't be pleased It's difficult...You tell him Flo I think he understands I don't While waiting... This is hard... Florence and I are together now Together? Living together This is true, Florence? Don't be angry...I'm your friend Of course not; I'll wait my turn And you'll get it I was afraid you'd be upset, feel we were stringing you along We're fond of you Did you hear about Philippe, Florence? -I brought these back -Why? They're yours I can't accept them You stole them, remember? How are things? -Not so good -Tell me about it -A girl ditched me? -Is that all? Easy for you to say. Actually I hardly knew her It hurts Ah, youth; if that was the worst of our problems... Work hard, and you'll soon forget her -It's not that simple -I had my share of adventures, you know Easy come, easy go Today, I could buy ten girls like that Work hard, and you'll see When your cousin and all his pals fail their exams, you'll be sitting pretty Be positive; I'm here if you need to talk You're very kind Get back to work; no free novel today Thanks anyway These heartaches...To work now; don't waste a moment Dinner's ready...about time too I'm starving, I'm starving I burned myself -What's this? -Tomatoes Provencal This is living, eh? Three cheers for the cook Isn't life wonderful? Why bother studying when tomatoes toil not, but ripen in the sun? I'm following the advice of a friend... the bookseller you met He doesn't fancy your chances in the exams I should hope not! But don't you worry about me If I do fail, I won't cast a jaundiced eye To each his own method Dear Mother, I've been thinking about all you've done for me I'm going to pay you back a hundredfold, you'll see By the time I next see you, I'll be a brilliant graduate We can't have this Studying's all very well, but... He's going to pass Have a drink Florence wants to dance, but my feet hurt -Dance with me, Charles -No, really Not very gallant, is he? I'm not much of a dancer anyway Florence would love to teach you. It's a now or never opportunity No, I've got too much work to-do -What about me? -To each his own method Let him be Not much fun, is he? Don't forget to go to bed Hot, isn't it? -Where have you been hiding? -I'm working You're blocking the sun Bake away, then Had breakfast? I'll make coffee Tea? Chocolate? -What will you have, Flo? -The same as my beloved Charles You'll get coffee Have you a cigarette? You look pale. Why are you working so hard? You'll kill yourself Got a light? Right, Back to work... -No breakfast? -Tell Paul I'll have it in my room Stay... You'll tell him? It's ready Don't stop, I'm just going for a shower It's just me, going for a shower It's scalding! Let's have a bit of cold Not too much...God, women are stupid I'll be as red as a lobster God, you're so stupid You're not, I suppose! Pack up and go if you object! I'll do that! Paul...what's a sycophant? What are you talking about? Where's Florence? She didn't even prepare breakfast I've sad news to impart, my friend We were happy together, the three of us Now it's over She's still a good friend I'm fond of her You also, probably I most regret the Tomatoes Provencal -They were really good -I didn't like them You loved them No, I ate them just to please her It's sad, though, isn't it? -What will you do now? -God only knows Hard work, that's the thing. Girls like that are ten a penny The exams are in four days remember, and you haven't done much Do you feel well prepared? Go to it No fear I've sat exams before, and may again, I fear I see such matters as only relatively important Anyway, I bet that I have a way to counter lack of preparation I'm no champion at bridge, of course... But I can finesse with the best of them You've four days Three; I sit mine a day before you I'll blaze the trail It's incredible Let's celebrate Look at me carefully; don't you notice something different? I've passed I foxed them completely Great about Paul, isn't it? Eat, drink, smash everything! I failed...but Paul makes up for that -When do you sit? -Tomorrow Drink up, there! A miracle is a cause for celebration -I'm proud of you -So am I -Where are you going? -To work Don't overdo it. Am I not living proof of the futility of work? Have a rest Tomorrow. I'll be free then Things come easy to you, but sadly I'm the slow type I must admit to being very moved Events unique in life call for special celebration... ...equally unique You success is such an event. So, thanks to my famed munificence... ...a surprise No, not the Italian again! The Great Matton! Uncle Henri shot those trunks! You'll die of exposure! Ladies and gentlemen First I'll break the chains... ...proving that nothing can withstand me This is how the Sultan of Turkey chained his prisoners ...before having them hurled into the Bosporus He won't make it You're working? -You're not very polite -I'm busy I just came to say hello -What's that? -Law I know. But what, exactly? -Is it interesting? -It's just work You seem a bit down I'm as happy as a bird in a cage Must you work? I've no choice You could relax a bit I hate that lot Stay then; sit over there I'd rather be near you. Stop for a moment Don't you realise my exam is tomorrow morning? Go away and leave me alone I'm not Paul. I have to revise I promised my mother I'd pass, and I care about her All you care about is screwing Oh sorry Go away. You're stopping me working Go away What went wrong? You worked so hard Nothing, I'm just tired Church closed 19.30-06.15 -You look glum -I am -Woman trouble? -In a way The same one? Yes, but that's not all; I failed Did you work? Yes I worked It's not the end Well, you'll just have to try again It'll be easier next time Don't lose heart, get back to work right away...and no women! I haven't seen you around here for days Found a new love? Actually, what you had your eye on all along... ...was me I don't want him to wake Don't let him wake I have one chance in six You have five chances in six My God, what a state Been out on the tiles, have you? -Celebrating your triumph, I trust -No, Paul, I failed -I don't believe it...the bastards! What happened? I don't know.... I got muddled. Fell into their traps I was in a state Don't worry. I know you, you'll find happiness; you?re learning about life -Nothing to reproach yourself with -You think not? I envy the happiness ahead for you I've lost everything Don't be silly; a girl, an exam, a bit of time... If that were all... Oh, I see...your mother No, I don't mean my mother The Great Matton was fun, though, wasn't he? I was working Clovis comes up with some great surprises That Italian...Signor Arcangelo Whatsit...remember? Paul, don't!
