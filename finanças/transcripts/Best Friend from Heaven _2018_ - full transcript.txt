I always said the only thing my daughter would be on time for... ...is her own wedding. I guess I was wrong. Uh Paula. You think you two could... Play something for these very patient folks? Pretty sure that's something we can do. For Pete's sake. Nothing's even happened yet. I know, I know. It's just... I thought about how beautiful it's going to be and I lost it. Be more beautiful with flowers. No, no, I didn't mix up the dates. I'm just dropping the bouquet at the bride's house now. I got stuck behind Mr. Withers. You know... We really should politely mention to him that it might be time for him to hand in his - No. No way they bought that. Gabe? Gabe? Gabe! C'mon I'm late enough as it is. Come here baby. Hi!! What do you say Gabe? Want to get married today? Me too! Now where did you hide those rings? Want to take a bet on... Who's calling to yell at me for being late? Alright, Gabe. Dad says this is as fashionably late as I am allowed to... It's Tara. You knew she was going to be a little late. Yeah... yeah. Hey! I thought it was always bad luck to... Yeah, yeah. I'm on my way. What's wrong? Gabe got hit by a car. Oh no. Hey. How is he? I don't know what happened. I was just trying to get the rings from him... And then dad called and I knew I was late already, and I just... It's okay. It's okay. How is he, Doc? He's taken a substantial amount of damage. I can operate see if I can reduce some of the swelling on his brain. Whatever it takes. Unfortunately, it's not cheap. It's not my labor mind you... Medicine, the procedure itself. We don't care. Anything. Um... I'm happy to help with the costs if you need it... I think you've done enough already. I'm truly sorry. We did everything we could. Oh wow, this is nice on the paws. Hey, I can talk! Pardon me. Hello? Yes you! Yeah, we're looking over here now. Ahhh, who's a good boy? Excuse me, I was wondering if you could tell me how to get to the church from here? I'm late for a wedding. Ya sure, no problem. All you got to do is go back and take a left at No Chance Avenue. - Name? - Gabriel. What are you talking about No Chance Avenue? What is this place? Well, let's see. You're walking on a cloud and listening to harps. Are you honestly not getting this? What? No, that can't be right. I'm going to my family's wedding. I saw a squirrel. And I chased him out to the front and... Oh no. Ahh, it's always the squirrels. Now, if you'll kindly sign here we'll get you sitting on a couch you can never get kicked off of. How does that sound? I can't! I have to get back there! They need me. Ya I feel for you, I do. But it's not how this works. Head on through, I promise you're going to love it. Hey. Excuse me? I think I might be lost? Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, no, no, no, no you can't be here! Squirrel! Oh no. Hey, hey, ya I need some paws down here! Ya, it's happening again! I'm coming home guys! Hey guys. I'm back! Look who's home! Oh ya I can talk now. Have you seen my tie? Don't be mad. You ready? Hey Pete! Can I sit with you up front? Or in back. The back's fine too! I'm just happy I didn't miss it! Hey, guys, where are you going? The car's out front. You... Ah... I keep opening the fridge door and expecting him to knock me over and steal a hot dog. I can't believe it's been over a month. A month? We were going to go on our honeymoon today, Gabe. You would have loved it. We found a place with a beach just for dogs. We miss you Gabe. They didn't get married. Hey! The rings are right here. Look! I'm sorry. Alright. A hundred and thirty five, a hundred and thirty six... A hundred and thirty seven. Hey! Remind me to ask the boss what the purpose of squirrels are. Squirrel?! What? No, I was... Nevermind. You just go on through. Chase them all you want. A hundred and thirty eight. Wait... Who's missing? Gabriel? Which one is... Huh! Oh no. Hey, I need, uh, someone to cover my shifts. One of the new arrivals went for... You lost another one? No! And if anyone asks, it's a walk. Who goes back?? Honestly - mountains of treats, no baths, no fleas. C'mon. Clothes... Alright Gabe, where did you go? It's alright. It's not the one I'm looking for. Hey dad. Tax season already? Actually, I wish. Just trying to figure out which vet bill gets paid this month and which ones can wait. Why don't you guys let me help you out? Really. I have a little socked away... Thanks, but we're fine. Besides, you've already done so much. You know... If this is just about getting married... You don't need a fancy wedding. I can marry you guys right here. I appreciate it. But we want to wait until we can do it right. We want everyone to be there. Missed you at church. We just need a little bit of time. Oh ya, ya no rush. Just, uh... Letting you know we, uh... We all missed you. I appreciate it. Hello? Um yeah. Can you hold on a second? Sorry about that. Yes, the dress still is available. No, nothing wrong with it, just, umm... never used it. Don't sell the dress. Sure. Five o'clock sounds great. I'll give you my address. Do you have a pen? I got to do something. Morning, Mrs. Jeffries. I'm fine. Thanks for asking. Hey mom. Yup! Couldn't be better! Everyone in town hates me which means I probably moved back to town just to run your business into the ground! Overreacting? You could be right but... Excuse me, Mr. Culligan! My mother's looking for a second opinion. Would you mind telling her how everyone in town can't stand me? Thank you! Hey mom. Yep, I got to go deliver these flowers to the only person in town still taking our business. I love you too. Enjoy the Grand Canyon. Morning, Norma. Jerry. Late again I see. Sorry. I got a flat. I was trying to flag someone down to lend me a hand. But people don't seem too eager to help me these days. Well, we all really liked that dog. Always appreciated your honesty there Norma. And while we're on the subject. I just want to say thanks... For continuing to use me for your flowers. You sticking by me during this... That is to say, it really means a lot. I promised your mother. Is that the only reason? Yep. Next week then? Try to be on time Jerry. I will. Mr. Jeffries! Mr. Culligan! This is useless... Hey! There's Jerry! Thanks for hitting me, and messing up my family! Maybe don't run into the middle of busy roads? Did you just talk to me?! You can see me? Seeing you isn't the biggest problem I'm having right now, although that is also troubling. This is perfect! You can help me throw the wedding!! I honestly have no idea how to react to this. It's fine! See I was up there, and He said to go through. But how could I? I didn't want to miss the wedding. Then I come down and found out it didn't even happen. But it's okay because you can hear me. So now you and me can fix this! Isn't that great?! What are you doing? I'm looking up psychotic episodes. Specific to dog hallucinations. You're not hallucinating! Look, I don't know how to explain it. But there's obviously a reason I can talk to you. Obviously. If you're the only one who can see me that must mean something. Even if I did believe this, which I don't. Why would... want me to help? I think I'm the last person Pete and Tara want to help put their wedding on. Mysterious ways, my friend! As of right now, you and me, we're in this together. No, we really aren't. I'm just imagining you because I feel guilty. That's all this is. Jerry, you know you're gonna help. Say yes. Come on. Be with me. You can ask me a million times, and the answer will still be no. Just say yes. - Say yes. - No. - Say yes. - Uh, uh. Say yes. No. Just say yes. No. Say it. Say yes. How about no. Say yes. Leave me alone! Okay, as soon as you say yes. Just say yes. Or I'm going to bug you all night. - Say yes. - No. And when my brother saw that truck under the tree... - Say yes. - No. The look in his eyes... - Say yes. - No. Say yes. Fine! Everything okay, Jerry? I do not suggest you say you were talking to me. Yea... I was just saying... Fine. You know, like this was a fine sermon today, there Rev. Nice save. May I? Now, I knew how much my brother loved that truck. So when curiosity got the better of me... And I broke it, I knew I had really messed up. Now here I am trying everything I can to fix this thing. I'm using tape, I'm using glue, I'm using bubble gum. But it wasn't until I admitted that I needed help... That that truck got fixed. So are you going to help? Quiet. I want to hear this. My dad, he fixed the wheels. My sister gave me a fancy art glue. And mom... God bless her. Used a red nail polish to make that thing look as good as new. And the moral of the story people... It takes a village. I will see you all next Sunday. Wait. Jerry? You have something to add? Um... Yes. Please. If that's okay? Hi everyone. For those of you who don't know me, I'm Jerry the guy who took over my mom's greenhouse. Some of you may also know me as the guy who ruined Pete and Tara's wedding last month. Ah... Oh... After listening to today's sermon I was wondering if you guys might be able to help me fix the thing that I broke. Recently, I've been getting a lot of pressure from someone to make things right for Tara's wedding. So... I thought we could throw them another one. But as a surprise. I don't know how open they'd be to me doing this so I think a surprise might be best. Jerry, Jerry, that is so kind of you... But a wedding is extremely expensive. It is. Yes. And I one hundred percent can't afford to throw them one myself. But I thought maybe we could all chip in and do it together. You know, like... As a village? Not bad, kid. Kindness is one thing Jerry but if I provide the food for an entire wedding it will bankrupt me. What if I agreed to work for you all in exchange for your help? I mean, I'm not exactly swamped with work these days. So if I helped you at your restaurant, or store, or whatever free of charge for a couple of weeks, then, maybe you could supply what's needed for the wedding? Well I suppose if I had an extra pair of hands around the restaurant it might be considered fair trade. There you go! We got food. What else do we need for a wedding? Music? Who's got music? Perfect! No idea what I can do for you, but we'll figure something out. Who's next? Well, I'll be. Yes. Little girl with the very sticky fingers touching my coat. I saw your dog. You did!!! Always the kids. That's great! Where did you see it? Come with me. Oh you have no idea how great this is. I am going to make sure you get extra... Yes, that's him. Where did you see him? You saw the poster. Yup! - Thank you very much. - You're welcome. Excuse me ma'am. I was wondering if you could help me. I've lost my dog Scooty poops. And you know what, I just I miss him so much. That looks like Tara's dog, Gabe. Yeah, um, I heard about that. I was actually just about to go over and give my condolences. To uhh... Tara. Tara, yes I am gonna go do that right now. Okay, thank you! Sir... I'd like to start off by saying how sorry I am for interrupting your sermon today. Stop. Stopping. I loved that dog. Yes sir. I imagine you did. And I don't think I could say sorry enough to make it better. You think it's your job to make it better? I don't know. A persistent little birdy put the idea in my head. Well if you think you can get my Tara and her Pete to come back to church you have my full support. Really? They're struggling. We all do sometimes. They're just not ready, and I'm not pushing. I know the feeling. You know... I think what you're doing here, is exactly what this town needs. A little community kindness. And I for one, am happy to practice what I preach. That's great sir. Thank you. I'm going to go get started. I feel like there is going to be a lot of work to do. Great. I'll see you tonight at six at the soup kitchen. Yes sir you... ahh? Soup kitchen? Well you're going to need someone to perform the ceremony, I assume. And an ounce of your time helping those less fortunate is a fair exchange, don't you think? Couldn't agree more. See you at six. I think I caught most of that. It's hard to listen through those doors. Did he ask you to make him soup? Couldn't you just walk through? Oh I didn't even think of that. See, you and me are gonna be a good team, Jer! Please don't call me that. What, Jer?? I can't call you Jer?? No. No what? Oh. Ah... No, sorry. Nothing. I was just talking to myself. Which is something I do when I want to feel embarrassed... You know what? I'm Jerry. Hi, I'm Shawna. It was nice to meet you. Thanks. Oh, hey, umm... Jerry, look if you need any help or anything just let me know. Okay? That would be amazing... Uhh... Sha... Shawna. Have you ever talked to a girl before? Okay, great. I'll keep that in mind. Thank you. Okay. I'll see you later Jerry. Awww. She remembered yours. That's got to make it even worse. So I'm thinking if we skip out on birthday gifts this year that will be enough to get us square with the vet bill. I'll make you a homemade gift again. Sure! I need a new TV stand for the broke one you gave me last year. Well someone just talked themselves out of a really uneven table. Hey Willow. Hi! You know, I was just thinking... Boy, I sure don't give Tara enough hugs. Can never get too many hugs I guess? Uh, we were just going to grab some cof... coffee. Do you want to join us? Sorry. No time. Can't. Gotta go! Hey Kevin. You will never guess what just happened, Willow... Tell me your favourite color? Sorry? If you had to choose just one between the both of you guys. Ummm... Ah... Pink. I guess? Fair enough. Are we on a hidden camera show? Well, I'm not picking my nose, just in case. Ah! You made it! Yes, sir. I figure this is as good a place to start as any. So, what do I do? Follow me. Luckily, this should be pretty easy for you. All you have to do is stand back here and serve these nice folks in line. Think you can handle that? Seems easy enough. I'll fix him if he messes it up. Oh, ah... Hi. You volunteer here too! You going for sainthood? Some of us help just for the sake of helping. Careful Jerry. You don't want both my daughters mad at you. Both? That means your... Tara's sister. Yeah, for my whole life now. I take it you hate me then too? No, hate is not something I let get a hold of me. Hey. Hey Carrie, how are you? Be a lot better if I could find some work. You know what, I'm sure something will come up. Promise. I didn't know so many people in town needed help. Yeah, sadly there's always lots of people who need help, right. Let's at least do our part. What did you think? That was actually a lot of fun. Hopefully the rest of plan goes as smooth. Well you did a good job. Any time you want to come down and help out, we'd be glad to have you. I think I just might. Well thanks and you're good to go. You sure? Does that mean you'll do the wedding? She's my daughter Jerry. I was always going to do it. Take care. Night Jerry. Night... Shawna. This is not... How does anything fit in here? I can barely get my head in. Give me a sec. I just want to water the flowers. Oh. That's definitely him. Okay. Alright... Ummm. Okay. Okay. Under here. This so much harder without paws! Ah! I'm a cat! Up the tree! Be like a cat. Fat cat! Very fat cat! You will not look up here. You will not look up here. There is nothing to see. Oh, I am so heavy. How do I get down? Hey! So I've got tomorrow all planned. We'll start by getting the jukebox for Norma. And then make our rounds. I'll navigate and I get to control the radio. How'd the soup kitchen go? You didn't think that Shawna being Tara's sister was worth mentioning? It never came up. Why does that matter? What? It doesn't. Just saying, it would have been nice to know. Awww! Somebody's got a crush! Enough of that. Get up. Why? Tara and Pete always let me sleep on the bed. Fine. But... Stay on your side. Can I be the little spoon? My paw falls asleep if I'm the big spoon. No spoons. Go to bed. We're just about ready to close so if you want food... You're have to order it right away. Mmm, 'Kay. Uh, tea? Coming up. Honestly, who invented a tie? Like putting a leash on yourself! - There you go. - Thank you. Hey Norma. Evening Willow. - Coffee? - Yes please. I need a pick me up. I'm working on Taras's dress. I'll have it one milk and nine sugars. You might want to dial that back a scooch. Oh no, I love the tingling feeling it gives me in my toes. Gonna see this one pretty soon. That's sugar foot darlin'. Here. Let's try a dollop of honey instead. You'll never believe what I saw today. A UFO? A log rider? No? Blue cats? I worry for you. No. I watched Jerry losing his mind. Standing right out front here, talking to an imaginary friend. Really? Yeah. Yammerin' on about dog hallucinations. Hi there. Me again. Uh, who is this Jerry fellow? You know... Jerry. Jerry! Ah ha. Right. Remind me. Jerry who is helping Pete and Tara with their wedding they didn't have because of the, you know... Right. Yes of course. Uh just wondering... Where might I find my good buddy Jer tonight? If he's such a good buddy you'd know he doesn't like to be called Jer. Hmmm... But he's most likely at his green house. Or wherever he grows his flowers. Uh, his... Greenhouse? Oh yes. He lives in a green house. Alright, thank you very much. Greenhouse for Jerry. Have a great night. Jerry's house isn't green. Yes it is. I ran into him the other day and he said... I'm on my way to the green house. Drink your coffee. Can you believe he's doing all this for them? Maybe he needs it... Like for himself. Hey, guys. - Morning, Jerry. - Hey Jer. Just... came by to get this over with. Figured it would be best to rip it off quick like a band-aid. Well the car is in good shape. I mean... It runs. Not so bad. Yeah. Would have been nice to finish it with my Dad but... But, that's life right? Anyway... That's your problem now. The clutch sticks a bit going into third. Come by and drive it whenever you want. Thanks. But... It just sat there. And this is a good deal. You guys get this... Norma gets the jukebox... Tara and Pete get food, and the best band I know. I've already loaded up the jukebox. I told Norma I'd bring it by after lunch. I appreciate it. Hi there. You must be the lady of the house. Sorry. That joke probably went over your head. I imagine most do at your size don't they? Ha, ha ha. Anyone inside the house speak? By any chance. Anyone? Hi, sorry about that. I didn't even hear you knock. She must be talking your ear off. Oh, my, uh, ya. Real chatterbox you got here. I am here with a rather specific task. Uh, what I'm doing is, um... Oh sweetie, I can't believe you remembered! Of course I remembered. You got me a singing telegram for my birthday! Yes, yes I did. Uhh, I'm sorry there must be some kind of mis... Hey, what day is it? It's your day, this is it. Hope it's grand, hope it's swell, hope your year goes as well! It's your birthday and your husband... Dan, will give you back rubs every night, for a year! Oh!! Oh my goodness. Thank you so much. That was fantastic! Okay. C'mon honey, I'm going to cash in on one of those back rubs. Let's go. Yeah, every year, or for the rest of my life. That long. A bit pitchy. I forgot to ask about the dog. My dad used to call me Jer. Oh. I know it seems dumb to ask people not to call me that, but... It just hurts too much. He was a good guy, huh? The best. Actually... He bought that car as a project for him and I to work on. That's cool. He was good with cars? Not even a bit. But we learned. Some of my favorite memories of my dad were with that car. This is crazy. Let's go back and see if we can figure something else out. I'm letting him down. It was just sitting there. Reminding me of how much I miss him. There's no way you're letting him down. I bet he's watching. Super proud of you right now. At least Paula can do something with it. She and her family taught us everything we know about cars. They're really good people. Hey um... I realized I haven't really said thank you for doing all this. You don't have to. I want to do it. I owe it to them. I wish I could help you more. But you're the only one who can see me. You could encourage me. I could use that sometimes. You got it! Let's start now! Come on champ, get up! What? You heard me, get up! You're gonna climb those stairs! Then you're gonna knock that chump out! Are you quoting Rocky? Name a better movie for inspiration. Can't argue with that. Here's the flowers and the gnome just like we promised. There you go. Oh my goodness! - Careful. - Okay. Thank you. Bye. You don't wave at me like that. No. I guess I don't do I? Afternoon Kevin! Got that lens for ya. So you do. Much obliged. So... So we're all square. That lens, for photography and the center pieces, yes? That was the deal. Perfect! We'll see you soon. Unfortunately, I got to change my conditions. What? What's wrong? Is that lens not the right one? Lens is fine. I got something else I need. Okay. Uh what do you need? Hold on. Let me get us some gloves. Oh no. What's wrong? Kevin is a Golden Gloves boxer. He probably wants me to be his training partner. Oh wow, that's going to go bad for you. Have you ever even been in a fight? Alright. Let's get to it. Kevin. I'm begging you. I'll do anything I can... Jerry... I need you to help me with my garden. Ohh... Okay then. Flowers I... I can help you with. Umm. Jerry! I'm so glad you could make it. No problem. Ah so... I was looking over this list and it says Pete and Tara can use your summer house for their honeymoon if I can get you a cloud? You're going to be a clown. Ohhh... Oh, this isn't good. I'll see you in there. This might not be... Not a word! Not... One... Word. Hey... Kids. Clown! Yay!! I'm Jerry... The clown. Seriously? That's not a clown name. I'm going to call you Stinky. Alright, then. I'll be right back. So... What do you guys want to do? Let's play throw cake at the clown! Yay! Yeah! Alright... Throw cake at the clown... I can't look. And I can't look away. Okay. That was fun. But... That was lovely Paula. Thank you. Always my pleasure. Jerry... How about an update on our Church's secret wedding? Go on. Come on up. Right. Uhh... I think it's going well! I've been able to secure the music, the food, photography. Flowers are looking great. But... Where I fall short, is in the cash department. I'm working on it. I think if I just have a garage sale and get some of my stuff out there then... How much do you need? Oh... It isn't much. I can work it out. I can give twenty dollars. It's not much. Really? That would be incredible. I have a dollar. I got a few bucks I could throw in. Shawna... How about we pass around the collection plate. I think this week we'll all donate it to another good cause. Oooh, this is going to be a nice wedding! Jerry. Do you have a second? Ahhh. Everyone's been really generous. I think this is actually going to come together. Yeah, you did a really great job. I couldn't have done it without all your help. Oh... Well since you mentioned it... I was just wondering when do I get to cash in for all of my help? Oh... Oh wow, I'm sorry. I didn't even think of that. With all that's been going on. You're right. What can I do for you? Well. There is this person that I did promise them I'd help clean out their garage. I just have literally not had a second... So... Consider it done. Yeah? Yeah. What's the address? I've got the afternoon free. Perfect. Honestly Jerry, this is such a huge help. Thank you so much. Tara's house. You have to talk to her. I really don't think she wants... Sometimes what people wanna do, and what people need to do... Are two different things. Okay. Thanks Jerry. I really appreciate it. Hey. I don't really know how this all works. I mean that, I know we don't chat that often, and I'm not blaming you, that's... That's on me... But if you have a sec... I could really use some advice. I know I screwed up. I do. And... I'm really sorry. And I'm scared to death of seeing them. So if you could just... send me a sign. Anything. Just show me that they even want to talk to me. I'll go. Jerry come on man. It's like a bazillion degrees out there. You picked a seriously odd angel. I could really use some of that encouragement right now. Put a foot forward. Take the first step... That's all it takes. I think I need to do it alone... If that's okay? I'll be right here. Jerry? Hi. Hi. I... Uh... Probably should have thought about what I was going to say before I actually stepped up here. I'm not exactly great at thinking on my feet. Tara. What are you doing here Jerry? Here it goes... I was talking to your sister. And she thought that... Why were talking to my sister? It's a long story. We don't care. I think we've heard enough. Please don't come here again. Wait. Come on in. What are you doing? He took the first step, so I'm inviting him in. That's the family rule. You have a really nice place here. Right. No small talk. I don't like dogs. - What? - Unbelievable. I just never understood them. The way that they smell... Jumping all over you. Or licking your face. Is this really what you came to say? I finally understood. That day. When I saw what I'd done, to you... The look on your face... All at once... I finally knew what all the other people knew. That accident... I didn't just take your dog from you... I took your family. I left the gate open. I ran to grab the phone, and I left the gate open. It's my fault he ran out into the street. I blame myself for not being there. I'm gonna go. I just thought I should come by, and I did, so... I'm really glad you came over. Me too. Oh. I almost forgot... Uh... Shawna said you needed some help cleaning your garage. - What? - I don't have a garage. Really? I kind of owed her, so I was repaying the favor. I think you just did. One more thing. It's... Kind of a long shot, but... I promised your dad I'd try to see if I could get you to come to church this Sunday? Tell him... We'll be there. Great. See you there. You got a good family there pal. I got a good friend too. I really appreciate you letting us use your space for the reception. Oh, I'm so excited! I love weddings. You sure we can get it all done by this weekend? Of course! I'm finished Tara's dress. And there is just a few things to clean up around the studio. If you could grab that bucket, I think I can handle the rest. How are we supposed to get this place ready by Sunday? You can start by... Grabbing that bucket. I have an idea. You didn't even move the bucket. Hey! We got the good stuff today. - Shawna. - Jerry, what's wrong? Nothing. Well... Willow's place. How much money did we make? I don't know. I'd have to double check, but quite a bit. Why? Hey everyone. Uh, sorry to interrupt your breakfast. But I was wondering if anybody might like a job? Alright. Then finish your food and come meet me at Willow's studio. By the way, thank you for making me talk to your sister. Hey you, I was going to move your bucket. But I was like - Nope! That's Jerry's bucket. I know, but Willow... Meet your new employees! What can we do to help? Let's turn this place into a reception. Put it over there. Oh, careful. Watch out. I think we need something here where the food will go. Ah Willow, do we have anything that will make this area pop? Here! I made this! Umm, I think this will be perfect at the front, you know, where everyone can see it. Fantastic! Wait until you see this baby lit up. I think that's about it. Please tell me we're done. All trades, all jobs, all favors exchanged. We are now officially finished. Thank goodness. Can I sleep now? We can sleep after the wedding tomorrow. If you get that, I'll let you be the little spoon tonight. Ah ha, they can't see me. Would you if they could? We'll never know. Alright! I'll be right there. Come with me, in case I fall asleep. Hi there. Can I help you? Hi. You! Me? You can see him? Him? Ya, course I can see him! I've been searching for him all over town. You're the little fella. First of all, very rude. I am as I was created. Second of all, yes. I'm the little Fe... The one you ran away from. So if you don't mind, I'd like to go back. Please open the gate, let's go. Hold on! I don't understand. Where'd you say you came from? You said you were... Oh wow. Are you... No. I just work there. Or at least I did before all this mess. So if you don't mind... Please. I can't. Why? Please, I... I know this seems crazy, but we've been working so hard to keep this wedding together. And tomorrow's the day. See first Jerry had to feed the homeless. That's where he met Shawna. And then we were helping Norma, and Kevin's flowers... Oh yeah sure. Kevin deserves flowers. And then Shawna convinced him to talk to Tara and Pete. And now everything is set. What and, I talked to your boss, and he sent me a sign! What? You didn't tell me that. Yeah, it was really cool. Sorry, I meant to tell you. Alright you know what, this is.. This is... This is a wonderful story. And I'm sure it's going to have just a fantastic ending. But you and I, we will be watching from up there. You know, that is if you're still invited. Look... I know this seems crazy. I hardly even believe it myself, but the fact is, Gabe talked to me... and he came back. So there must be some sort of reason, right? It's possible. So just let us just see this through. Then I promise, tomorrow I go with you. No running. You know what? Fine. I probably lost my job already anyway. Ahh... I am so tired. You can stay at my place. Thank you. I already called dibs on the little spoon. Already regretting this. Why do you sleep on the floor? What? Where else was I suppose to sleep? In the bed. That's where I sleep. What? I didn't even know that was an option. Uhh mm my back. Come on. I need a walk. I'm taking Denny to help me with something. Call if you need us. Phone two dogs, that's perfectly normal. Have fun! Hey Willow. What's up? Okay. I... Just stay calm. I"ll... I'll be right there. - I just think it's very important. - Yeah, as do I. Hey. What's wrong? The wedding's off. We should call Pete and Tara. What? No, no nothing's off. Just the power's down. I called, the whole block will be out for probably at least a day. Does that mean the church too? Yeah, yeah. Dad called me, he was out buying candles. This is perfect. We're done. No, no, we're not done. We just need to find somewhere that still has power. What about your greenhouse? I don't know. It's big enough, but it's not exactly reception ready. I can fix that. Carrie, I can't ask you to do this. I mean we spent all the money trying to get this place ready. I didn't say anything about money. Leave it to me. - Are you sure? - Yeah. Just get them there on time, okay. Okay, great. I will call everyone and let them know. And make sure everyone lends a helping hand. Alright then! Wedding's back on! And I've got tons of candles. I'll see you guys at the church. Okay great! Go team! - Hey. - Hey. You okay? Yeah. You? Yeah. This is crazy... You know they can see me right? I need to make sure they're gone. Okay, come on. Let's go. I need you to help me fix something I screwed up. They can't get married without them. You know, they don't actually need these, right. Honestly, it's just a symbol. If they love each other, it's enough. I know. But I want to make today such a good day, that they forget about the bad day. They are never going to forget that day. It probably wouldn't hurt if they didn't forget this day either. Alright. C'mon. I knew you were a softy. Where is everyone? - Hey Dad. - Hi guys. What's going on? Why isn't anyone at church? Oh they're at church. They just aren't here. So what are we doing, then? Something we should have done a long time ago. Why don't you go inside and get changed. Changed? Yeah, so we can get started. Go on. Let's get you a bow tie. Okay. Oh just set it on the head table. Dearly beloved we are gathered here today to join this man and this beautiful woman in holy matrimony. And love, is not just a word. Love is that last thought you have before you go to sleep. It's that hand that you hold onto, not because you have to, but because you can. And sometimes love is not even for us. We give love to others... Just to see them smile. And the best part is... Love is something that we don't run out of. Even when we loose someone that we poured our whole heart into we realize that when it comes to love always find a little more to give. The rings, now the rings. Oh, we don't have them. - Yeah, we lost them. - It's okay. Thought you two might be able to give this guy a good home. Our rings! How did you find them? I guess someone who loves you found them. Come on, let's get ready. Do you, Pete... Take my beautiful daughter... To be your bride? I do. And do you, Tara... Take Pete, to be your husband? I do. And I now pronounce you husband and wife. This is beautiful. Too bad everyone else couldn't be here. Thanks Dad. ♪ It ain't what she's wearing ♪ That's making me turn around ♪ And it ain't what she's sayin' ♪ Cause I ain't heard a sound ♪ I wish I had the words ♪ To say what I mean ♪ Cause somehow I love you ♪ Is not strong enough for me ♪ And I'll find the words ♪ I've got forever to try Ladies and gentleman, Pete and Tara Maguire. I can't believe what an incredible job you did. It was easy with so much help. No really. You've got a great eye for this. Hey, this is your place right? It is, yes. We were hoping we could book it for our wedding this fall. Oh, well, it's not really... As long as it's not the day that I would like to book this place for renewing my vows. Well, you guys can book that through my new partner. Partner? Yeah. She's in charge of booking all weddings, parties whatever you need. Great. Let's step over here and talk about what you're thinking. So you throw one wedding and you're starting a business now, huh? Well, I figure it's pretty easy. As long as I employ every person in town every time I need help. Look how happy she looks. She deserves it. You did a really great thing. We'll be back in a couple minutes to do another set. But for now it's time for you chickens to ask those pretty girls to dance. What do you say? I would love to. Time to go. Alright. They look happy don't they? Which one? All of them. C'mon. Hey. Two minutes? Do I have a choice? Take your time. So, that was it. You're just going to leave? No goodbyes? My job here is done. Tara and Pete got their wedding. I got to make a new friend. Looks like you did too huh? Yeah. I guess so. I'm going to miss you Gabe. I'm going to miss you too Jerry. Call me Jer. Jer it is. Hey. What's it like up there? It's like a long drive where the window's always down. You're a good boy Gabe. Ummm. So we didn't know this was happening Um so obviously I didn't plan anything to say. We've had a pretty tough time And sadly I chose to hide it from everyone. But when I look around at all of this, what everyone did, just because, I realize how lucky we are to have friends. Family. Like all of you. And the more we talk to everyone the more we learn what love truly means. So we'd like you all to join us in a very special toast. To Jerry! - To Jerry! - To Jerry! C'mon, come here. To Jerry! Thank you. Thank you. - I have to go. - Oh, no. - Stay. - Come on. Hey. You alright? Yeah. Just, I don't take compliments very well. Well, then you probably shouldn't go back in there. Everybody's waiting to congratulate you. Perfect. Well hey you don't have to go back in. Let's do something. Just you and me? Yeah sure why not? I'd love to. Yeah? That sounds great. Sorry. The truck's kind of a mess. I don't mind. Hey! What? Did you really think we were taking this car? I've watched you and your dad fix the car up ever since we were kids. I just needed to finish it up for you. I don't know what to say? I thought you could use someone doing something nice for you too. Go enjoy it Bud. We love you Jer. After you. Well, he's off to a good start. I'd say you're right. Okay... This time you have to promise to go through. I am really behind on my paper work. Don't worry. I promise. Nothing's gonna stop me from going through this time. Hey I think I'm lost. Oh no.
