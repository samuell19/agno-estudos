Hop in, Yella. I'll give you a lift. Come on, Yella. No, Yella, I'll keep my distance. Okay? Let's just talk a bit. You got a job! Must be a good one, a real good one! I can tell. By the way you walk. "Pedestrians please use other side", says so there. So I have to come over to you, right? In Stendal, remember? After your great lecture at the association. You walked just like that. We crossed the fields and you took off your shoes. We just walked along the river. Yella, I miss you so... You can go back, the construction site is over. Is my father there? Ben is looking for you, even hangs around out front. I got the job, Papa. Starting when? In two days. I'm leaving early tomorrow. I've rented a room, in a hotel. Until I've passed the trial phase. Then I'll get a real place. It's a good company, Papa. They make steering modules for Airbus. Also it's not so far away. Just two hours. Yella. Yella, get up. This is for you. I don't need it, Papa. I'm making money. But you have to pass the trial period. I get paid even for that. The taxi. Yella, Mr. Fichte. Can I bring you to the station? Just to the station. When does your train leave? - 16 minutes after the hour. Hannover? What kind of job is it? This isn't the way to the station, Ben. Just a short, sentimental detour. I thought you'd like to see our house and the company. I'd like to get to the station, Ben. What did we pay for the accounting software? The network, the computers? Was it 70,000 or 80,000? Do you remember? Yesterday they did an estimate. It's worth 2,000. And the stuff isn't even a year old. Guess where I'm going soon. To Brunner. I calculated everything. Here, take a look. I need 25,000. Then I can calm down Lindemann and pay the wages. Dr. Strätz said the airport plans will be certified in 2 weeks. Heating and climate control systems will have a volume of 300,000. And the contract... At least take a look. At least take a look! I want you to stay with me. It will be just like old times. Things will be good again. You'll make out fine, Ben. "You'll make out fine, Ben"? Listen how you talk to me. Like a therapist or what? "You'll make out fine, Ben." I'd like to get out, Ben. - "I'd like to get out, Ben." Sure, when there's no money left, then pretty Yella wants out. She goes to Hannover, applies for a job, shows off her pretty legs. And stupid Ben, he sits at home on his junk heap... and gets a measly 2,000 Euros for his network. Stop here! Please stop right here! I want to get out, Ben. I'm sorry. I won't say another word. I love you, Yella. Ben! Ha-ha, tricked you. You reserved for six weeks? - Yes. But you haven't made a deposit. You didn't ask for one. I didn't ask for one? - Or your co-worker. The co-worker made a mistake. I'm sorry, this card doesn't work. Do you have a credit card? Could I give you my I.D.? I'll sort it out tomorrow, I just need to get some sleep. Everything's fine, don't worry about a thing. Thanks for the money, Papa. I'll give it back to you soon. You can call me here. The number is 0511... 3344-346. See you soon, Papa. Call me. Are you interested in balance sheets? I'm sorry. It sounded a bit arrogant, "Are you interested in balance sheets"? Yes. I am interested in balance sheets. English? Business English. What are you doing here? I live here. At the hotel, temporarily. Trial phase? Where are you starting work? Alpha Wings. They're still hiring? Who hired you? Schmitt-Ott? Good luck for tomorrow. Yella! Wait a sec, Gerd. Yella, can you run up and get some papers from my office? In my desk, upper left drawer, a small pigskin portfolio. You're an angel. So, Gerd, I'm back... What are you doing here? - How's that? I asked, what you're doing here! - Dr. Schmitt-Ott asked me to get something. Dr. Schmitt-Ott is not allowed on the premises, please leave. Hello? Hello. I said nobody is allowed to enter. What are you doing down there? Go get Christian for me. He has to seal this place off. Yella! Did you get the portfolio? - Yes. Schmitt-Ott here, I need a car at the Expo grounds. "Rue de Paris" on the corner of "Sydney Garden." Where is your car? - It was a company car. Can I have the portfolio? What about my job? I can arrange something for you in Hamburg. The portfolio. What kind of job is it? The job in Hamburg. What kind of job was it supposed to be here? What did you apply for? Accountant. Well, good, then accounting. What starting salary did we agree on? Two and half, three? Or... 2,100. Can I have the portfolio now? 460. Seems like someone got there before me. No, no, I'm not accusing you. Not you. Ever eat oysters at 11 in the morning? Where can we get some oysters? - At the Fürstenmühle. Then we're going to the Fürstenmühle. They have nice rooms there too. Excuse me. Hello? Hello? I need someone to accompany me to a meeting. Someone who knows about balance sheets. They have new injection pumps. Tested them in the lab. Almost sure to get the patent and now they want to go into series. Their deal with a French motor manufacturer isn't solid yet. They need to go into production now, for that they need money. How much do they need? 850,000. And how much do you want? 30 percent. Interest? Equity. I want to set the rules for the negotiation. You can look in three directions. First, at the opposing party... and not at the lawyer but at Dr. Fritz, the business manager. The guy is an engineer, a developer. He hates three things: Money, negotiations, chatter. When he sits back, then gaze at him calmly. When he looks back, hold your gaze 2 or 3 seconds. Then look again at your screen. The second direction is your screen. Why? - On the screen are the balance sheets... and they show why he can't get a normal loan anymore. I'd like to remind him of that now and then. And the third direction? Do you know "broker posing"? Like young lawyers in lousy Grisham films. I don't like to sit this way at negotiations but it has an effect. If I do the broker pose, then lean over and whisper something to me. What? Doesn't matter, anything. Like those court scenes, when someone slips the lawyer a note... and right away he whispers to someone. Everyone wants to know what was on the note. They lose their concentration. Put these on, please. No, they won't do at all. In July we'll mount them on Formula-1 cars. Sorry. How many? - 3 to start. Peter, it's important that it won't be a bulky lab model... but a device that is a real product. Pierre Sombart agreed to mod 3 cars for the first race. Then to push to install them in the SOS-series in September. The volume of the new SOS-series... will be 12,000 units. It was Pierre's idea to refit the older 608 models. That would make 9,000 units. If it works. It's important for me that you say: "I believe in this plan." We aren't just talking about numbers... You should reach your goal with utmost skill and principle. I have a suggestion: Let's do the math... what volume must be reached to break even. Let's fix that number. Ms. Fichte? One moment. Mr. Prietzel... These assets you just mentioned, set at 1 million... what are they based on? It's in the documents before you. Assets based on real estate. Network, software, inventory, et cetera. For your network and software you calculated 80,000 Euro. It isn't even a year old, yes. But you wouldn't get more than 2,000. It's worth at least 80,000. I noticed, Dr. Fritz... the 80,000 that the network supposedly cost... doesn't appear in your deduction report. What deduction report? - Your tax report. With all due respect, this isn't the tax office here. I was wondering why this investment doesn't appear as costs in the report. The only reason I can see is that it wasn't an investment at all. I can't follow you, anybody else? I believe that the hardware and software for the network... was acquired from the bankruptcy of another company. How much did you pay for it, 2,000? The Dissolve Group received 2,000 Euro in August. Another 1,000 Euro... was paid to a software firm to configure a network. The Dissolve Group specializes in sales of insolvent companies. Is that where you got your network? - Possibly. Excuse me, but what does this have to do with our negotiations here? Perhaps this insolvent company did pay 80,000 Euro for the network. But re-sale netted them only 2,000; it turns up here, worth 80,000 again. How much would you get for it? What Ms. Fichte is trying to say: It's not about security. We aren't at the tax office, but neither are we at the local bank. It's not about security and loans. It's about perspectives. I think that's what we should work on. Did you see Prietzel's face? 35 percent, let him chew on that. I have to apologize to you. What for? I underestimated you. You really know balance sheets. You thought I slept with Schmitt-Ott to get that job. That doesn't matter to me. That's not an answer. You're right. Real good job. 1,000 okay? Thanks. I'm the one who's grateful. I have lots to do. Good night. Ben? Ben? Ben! Let's get out of here. No! Your door was open. Are you packing? You know those cartoons about stupid questions? A guy brings out the garbage, idiotic neighbor at the fence says: "Are you bringing out the garbage?" Yes, I'm bringing out the garbage. I have another question, Yella. Another deal where I need someone to accompany me. Philipp, this is Klaus. I have your documents right here. Honestly, 27% is a bit thin. We were planning an more... Klaus, they'll be in the black by the 3rd quarter, for sure. Klaus, those are real assets. Network, real estate. They have about a million as back-values. Yes. Of course, Klaus. That was our employer. You were listening. You acted like you were reading something on your screen... but your eyes weren't moving. Is that why I should wear glasses? I thought we agreed on 35%. See, you were listening. Something funny? How about a short break? Ms. Fichte? They'll come back and ask for an adjournment. I think so too. That was nice the way you laughed. He strikes a pose, and we just laugh at him. You like the work, right? That's clear. Dr. Friedrich would like to adjourn for now. Until Wednesday? Same time, same place? Wednesday isn't possible. Friday? Friday. There's 75,000 in this envelope. Here are deposit slips for the cash. I already filled them out. Could you deposit this for me? You split the sum up. Yes, otherwise they must declare it. I'll wait for you in the café over there. Excuse me, there's 25,000 too much. Everything went ok? Yes. I have a real strange feeling. What do you think? I think they need money, just to pay their bills. That's how I feel too. - What do you suggest? We should check the balance sheets again. Why? I'd like to see if they have unpaid bills, and how they hid them. Fine. Can I invite you to dinner? By the way, Yella, I gave you 25,000 too much earlier. That's right. Here it is. Who's this? Your terribly sick Papa? Or the little brother, who wants to go to college? My husband. I'm separated from him. I wanted out and he... Why are you telling me this stuff? - I want to explain. He's following me, and I thought... I said, I'm not interested! The first train to Wittenberge. Early tomorrow. From Hannover. Hello? Wittenberge. On the Elbe River. From Hannover. Hello? Hello! Excuse me. The door was open. Do you know this one? What is it? "Road to Cairo." He needs the 25,000. Heat and ventilation systems. And where? Wittenberge. But nothing is being built there anymore! How does he plan to save the company with 25,000? They're building the airport there. - Which airport? The DHL-airport. With 25,000 he can stay afloat until construction starts. It's a big contract. Then he'll pay back the 25,000. They're not building an airport in Wittenberge. Yes, they are! They're building it in Leipzig. Wittenberge lost out long ago, a few months back. Shit. Why didn't you write a return address on the envelope? Why would you send the money anonymously? He's stalking me. He was in my room a few days ago. I think he's somewhere nearby. And the money will keep him busy so he'll leave you alone? You really think that would've worked? You have a bad conscience since you don't love him anymore. No, that's not it. I don't love him because he's ruined... he hasn't got anything left. That's why I have a bad conscience. Did he put that into your head? "You're leaving, because I'm poor, finished." "I'm stuck in the ruins of my company and love for you..." and you just leave. "Find yourself someone new, someone with money, et cetera." Yes, exactly. I have to go. Did you look at the books again? Friday. The appointment. No, I thought I... Yes... do it. Thanks. Sleep well. You too. We're somewhat disappointed. I'll put it this way: Naturally we made plans. We arrived at our own numbers. Sadly, it is quite far from your proposal. We have a system that alone is worth quite a bit. We have inventory, as "going-concern" it represents at least one million. But you rank us differently. We ask how can we be compared to a "start-up"... which only has one idea, a pile of paper? We understand your viewpoint, and how you see the situation. But you know we aren't here to audit your assets... nor look at your warehouse, we aren't taking inventory. If we were, our offer would be quite different. How so? Your warehouse doesn't interest us. What you have is an idea, an idea is always a high risk. That's why our offer is 40%. Warehouses are for creditors, and that isn't the issue here. Excuse me, Oliver, but we came here today... because we thought you had worked on your plan. Now you start again with your assets, which are none. We're disappointed. You know I cheat. It doesn't matter to me. Yella, I have to go. Where? A job. In Dessau. Battery producer. When? Early tomorrow. Will you come with me again? Papa. I'm fine. I'm working. I'll come visit you soon and tell you everything. You can't reach me here after tomorrow... We... we're driving to... - So where are you driving? So did you already fuck? Sorry. I want you to love me again, and then I talk like an asshole. I thought things out, Yella. The company ruined our love. And you know what? I shit on the company. I shit on all that crap. I'll go back to work, as an electrician. We could rent a small apartment. Somewhere in a real city. That's what you always wanted, right? Yella. We'll fix up the apartment real nice. Do it all ourselves. Simple and neat. "You're so talented, my hero," that's what you used to say. Leave now, Ben! No, we have to leave together, Yella. Philipp! Oh, sorry. I didn't mean to... How long did I sleep? 24 minutes. Really? Where are we then? - We're almost in Wittenberge. Wittenberge? - I just wanted to show you my... Stop! Stop right now! Move over. Move over! That wasn't the agreement, damn it. You want to visit your father. Shit! I really lost it back there. I saw us in your father's living room, trying to make conversation. Then you'd yawn, stand up and say: "So, I'll leave you two together now." Shit, then it starts. It always starts in: "Do you enjoy your work?" Or, "What do you earn, is there a future in it?" Where and how do you want to live? A house with garage and a green Jaguar... and kids, in the suburbs. Try to understand, that's just what I don't want. That doesn't interest me. What does, then? Just not that. What do you steal the money for? Know how many drilling rigs there are in the world? Know how much it costs, when an oil drill breaks? They drill a thousand meters deep. You need 2-3 days to get the drill out again. 15-20 million. In Cork, Ireland, there's small company that developed a damage safety system. For normal drills, in hardware stores. I'm interested in this company, closing in on it. Take a look at this. The system can be simply applied to the oil drilling rigs? What would they pay for it? - 800,000. Per drill. How can you sell something for 800,000... that you can buy in any hardware store for a few Euros? That's the problem. A packaging problem. That's wonderful. That's what I steal money for. How much do you still need? I Still need 200,000. Want to join me? The preamble states that we are dealing with an investment of 1 .6 million. We've split it up into 200,000 personal capital... and 1.4 million as shareholder investment. The second point is that the new technology which Dr. Gunthen... submitted to the patent office will be applied commercially by next year. Not as a prototype, but as a product available to customers. The console uses our battery and will be presented at the next CeBit fair. What's that? - The console, the game console. Yes, sure, that's clear. How many units? Between 500 and 1,000. You think that's realistic? - That's a good application. Yes, but with a high risk. Otherwise we wouldn't be sitting here. Good, there was an insolvency problem. The patent lawyer has stated that the new patent beats the old one. I don't mean beat, but rather it doesn't infringe on it. That's your gut feeling. A solid gut feeling. Fine. You were bankrupt. The administrator sold off your back assets. Also your patent, to an American holding company, which isn't really allowed. Now you have a new patent... - The new patent doesn't breach the old one. It's a completely different product. The patent lawyer... Werner, we know your assessment. But there is someone who could make your life difficult. Who might that be? The Americans, whose patent might be infringed on. Are you going in with them? Yes. How high? 35% are in it at the end. I have to go into town. I need something to wear. That's going to be my last customer. They're dumping me. Why? Why do you think? Here, you need money. What for? Shopping- The papers are in the glove compartment. I'll be waiting for you. Good afternoon. Yella Fichte, is your husband home? What do you want from him? Sorry, I have to talk to your husband. Go away. I'd like to discuss something with you. We are going to invest. I'm happy to hear that. We're going to invest and want 35%. Fine. I think so too, that's good for you. It's also good for you. We could have pushed for 45%. You wouldn't have complained. The risk with the patent is quite high. What do you want? Is this the routine with you? How much do you want? 200,000. Papa, you were going to fix my flute! Yes, one minute, dear. I have a life insurance policy. - How high? 600,000. - How high a credit can you get on that? 30,000 tops. That's all that I have. You have the house. It belongs to my wife. That's impossible. Please leave now. We're not finished yet. Then make it 45%. But please leave now. If the Americans learn that your patent could be annulled... you'll have nothing left. You can't be serious! I thought you wouldn't be coming back. You should find someone else. Not even a small-time shit bank would hire me now. I love you. No, Susanne, we can't wait any longer. Don't tell me to relax, I am relaxed, okay? They're getting impatient here. Yes, connect me to his mobile again. Susanne? I'm just getting his voice-mail. Connect me to Mrs. Gunthen again. Hello, Barbara, Werner here. He hasn't arrived yet. Where could he be? If you see him, tell him to call me immediately. Okay. No, we can't wait any longer. It's almost twenty after. I love you. Susanne, keep trying, on both mobile phones. If you reach him, please tell me right away. He'll be here any minute now. Where is he? He went over to the company. Is there water somewhere here? Yes. I love you, Yella.
