Here we are, Mugs. Our first day of class at Pooch University. Oh, boy! I've waited my whole life, all two years of it, to attend Pooch U. Me too! And look at this place! It's everything I thought it'd be. Let me tell ya. Smell these halls, the textbooks, the number two lead pencils, the erasers! Listen to those paws squeak on the freshly mopped tile floors. Oh, I've dreamt of this! So have I! Hey, let's find our classroom. I don't want us to be late to our very first lesson. Neither do I! Let's go. Check this place out, Mugs! It's so big! So sprawling, it's vast! I know! Imagine throwing a bone down this hallway, then chasing after it. Oh, what fun! Or a Frisbee! Now, hold on a second, buddy boy. This is the world of scholastics, an institution of higher learning. Yeah, so? What's your point? Well my point, pup pupil, is this. We can't act like a couple of animals here. We're not marauding mutts, backyard brutes, canine commandos. We're students, and we're here to get an education. Oh, yeah! I gotcha. No chasing our tails or alerting when someone uses a pencil sharpener! Or barking when someone drops a book. Oh! No barking? Oh, no barking, Slobberstick. Zero, nada, zilch. Barking's a no go here. We bark, and we'll be canine non grata for the rest of the semester, you mark my words. Sheesh! Okay, but barking is my favorite activity, Mugs. It's gonna be some kinda tough to control myself. Well you got to, Slobberstick. We only get one chance to make a first impression, and I want ours to be the best it can be. Who knows, maybe someday we'll be professors here. Whoa! Really? You think? If we play our biscuits right, you never know. That'd be incredible! Professor Slobberstick. Professor Mugs. The future's bright, Mugs. Let's buy some chains. First things first, Slobberstick, let's get to class. Here we are! There's our room number. Oh, boy! Here we go! Uh, hi. You must be Professor Fetch. And you must be Slobbersticks and Mugs. Mugs and Slobberstick. Nice to meet you. Yes, yes! Well, are you dogs ready for your introduction to higher learning? Are we? We were born ready. Well! I like your attitude. Let's get ready to start class. Oh, goody! Goody, let's go. Toss something, Professor. You got a rock, a wet stick, an old shoe? Hm, well this is not that kind of class, this is higher dog learning. We must follow a certain scholastic etiquette. Etiquette? Is that a dessert? It's like a donut, right? Yum. I love donuts. Slobberstick, please. You're embarrassing us. Quite the contrary, Mugs. You are inquisitive, curious. Etiquette is the customary code of polite behavior in society, or among members of a particular profession or group. Oh! Like dogs. Yes, like dogs! Which, as it so happens, will be the subject of our first class today. Dogs? Woo hoo! I know this subject like the back of my paw. Me too! This should be fun. No doubt, pupils, no doubt. Since you boys are rearing to go, let's say we begin at once. There's much ground to cover. How sweet! Awesome! Let's see... Where to begin? Ah, how about with one you'll know. If you don't mind me asking, Mugs, what kind of breed of dog are you? Me? I'm a sheepdog, Professor. Excellent! We'll start there. Have a seat. If you or your friends ever need to be corralled, it's a good bet that the Shetland Sheepdog can more than do the trick. In fact, herding is exactly what this cute little animal was bred to do. Shetland Sheepdogs are also known as the "Sheltie" for short. They're small dogs that look a lot like tiny versions of the very popular collie. The Sheltie is part of a group of dogs called "herding dogs". The amazing Shetland Sheepdog comes to the world from the Shetland Islands, where breeders created it by mixing Icelandic Yakkins with Border Collies. These pooches were primarily used to herd sheep so that they are kept away from garden plants. How neat! Even though when it comes to herding few dogs are as good as the Sheltie, today these magnificent mutts are mostly found herding kids around in homes everywhere. Moms and dads are very grateful for this. You can imagine. The Sheltie is super popular in the United States, where it comes in at number 20 on the most popular breeds list. Shelties can grow to be about 15 inches tall, and weigh in anywhere from 20 to 40 pounds. These cute little guys have a thick double coat, and a hefty mane around their necks. They come in lots of colors like black and gray, but it's the tricolored black, white, and tan ones that are most often seen, and wow do we love seeing them. They're just so doggoned adorable! Shetland Sheepdogs have heads that are shaped like a slice of pie, almond shaped eyes, cute little ears with folded tips, and muscular bodies with long tails. Shelties are incredibly smart too! In fact, they are the sixth most intelligent type of dog in the whole wide world. Wow! I didn't know all that. Neither did I. You were a mystery to me, buddy. Welcome to the world of higher learning, pupils. Where no subject is exempt from our probing minds, and no mental stone will be left unturned. Stones? I love turning over stones, and sticks, and balls, tennis balls especially! Slobberstick, please. Oh, right. Moving right along. Yeah! Tell us more, Professor. What about collies? Every wonder what the smartest dog in the whole wide world is? Well, you're about to meet them. Get set to meet the wondrous animal known as the Border Collie. Border Collies are working dogs who are relatives of landrace collies. These amazing animals were created during the 19th century by breeders to chase and keep farm animals like sheep together. Border Collies are world famous for their incredible intelligence, and excellent herding skills. Nowadays, they make super household pets too! Border Collies can grow up to about 18 to 22 inches tall, and weigh around 27 to 45 pounds. These dogs have smooth fur, and at times, it can even feel a little rough. They're usually black and white in color, but it has a beautiful double coat that can be a mix of white, red, and light or dark brown. They are gorgeous, simply gorgeous. Border Collies have flat, medium sized heads with loving, oval shaped faces, and ears that can either stand straight up, or be dropping. They have medium length hair that goes all the way to the tips of their tails. How handsome is this dog? Border Collies are famous for being the smartest dog in the world, and the smartest Bordie Collie ever was named Chaser. This amazing animal learned the name of each of her 1,000 toys. Now that's smart! Another super smartypants Border Collie was Striker. He learned how to roll down car windows using his nose and paws. Maybe he even knew how to drive, and just didn't tell anyone. Border Collies are insanely happy and loyal dogs who love to be surrounded with people and other animals. Hope you have a big backyard if you own one of these. These dogs need lots of exercise to stay happy and healthy. A bored Border Collie may drive you a little crazy. Border Collies can learn to do lots of important things like being search and rescue dogs, and serving as therapy dogs for people who need some extra attention. They really are all-purpose pooches. Rowdy, those collies! A boxer is a very interesting dog breed. Put 'em up, kids. You're about to meet a dog like no other! Say hello to the boxer! Well, not a real boxer, though these dogs would look super funny wearing boxing gloves. The boxer was created by dog breeders during the 19th century in Germany. They were made by mixing Mastiffs with English Bulldogs. The boxers were bred to be good hunting dogs, but over the years they've become really cool and popular house pets. You might even know one. They're medium sized dogs that grow to be about 21 to 25 inches tall, and weigh in from around 55 to 75 pounds. These handsome animals have short hair and smooth fur, and are usually multi-colored. Boxers have smallish heads with big lips and floppy ears, their jaws are usually square shaped, and their bottom jaws stick out farther than their top ones. How cute. So, how did this dog get its feisty name? The name "boxer" refers to one of the more interesting habits of this particular pooch. A boxer will actually stand on its back legs and use its front paws to actually box a bit. Wow. That's too cool. Also cool, there's a boxer named "Brandy" who holds the record for having the longest tongue ever in the Guinness Book of World Records. How long? 17 inches! Wow. A kiss from Brandy would leave you soaking wet. Be prepared, though. No matter what the tongue size, all boxers have a habit of drooling. Cute. Sloppy, but cute. Boxers are also super fast for their size, and when running, can reach speeds of up to 30 miles per hour. Whoa! They're super athletic dogs, and were usually circus stars. They were even used during the World War as messengers. Amazing. Boxers are so unique, Professor. I want to play with one. Who do you think would win in a tug-of-war, guys? Me or a boxer? You might stand a better chance with the next dog breed, Slobs. On to those chihuahuas. As you wish, Mugs. Here come the chihuahuas. Let's hope you're ready, because you're about to meet something really special. One of the smallest dogs in the whole wide world! Say hello to the chihuahua! The chihuahua is a member of the toy breed dog family, and they make awesome little friends, as they love being companions, and of course, adore lying in your lap. They sure are small enough to fit, huh? Chihuahua are relatives of an ancient Mexican dog that was known as the Techichi dog. These tiny barkers lived in Mexico for about 1,400 years before making its cute little way to the United States, and eventually, around the entire world. These little critters are super popular, or should I say, "pupular". Chihuahua only grow to be no more than nine inches tall, weighing in around four to seven pounds. Now that is so tiny. Want to know something cool? There was once a chihuahua named "Miracle Milly" and she holds the world record for being the smallest dog on Earth, being on 3.8 inches tall, and weighing just a couple of pounds! That's half the size of a banana! Aw, too cute. There are two kinds of adorable chihuahuas. One has long hair and a smooth coat, and the other is usually a silky, or at times, wiry single, or even double coat. They come in lots of colors too. Like red, black, gold, brown, white, and even sometimes show up as multicolored. No matter what your favorite color is, there's probably a chihuahua out there waiting to lick you on the face with a big old kiss. Chihuahuas have little round heads, big bulging eyes, and ears that stand straight up on their noggins. They're named after the largest state in Mexico, and for a little while, it was also known as either a Texas or Arizona dog because that's where these little fellas had been found in the United States, just near the Mexico border. What cool dogs chihuahuas are! I can't think of another small breed that has more charm than they do! Well, Mugs, are you familiar with the Pomeranian? The Pomeranian? No. Then allow me to introduce you. Looking for the perfect companion to have fun and cuddle with? Who isn't! Needless to say, you're gonna fall quickly in love with our next furry friend, the Pomeranian. Pomeranians are the smallest members of the Spitz family of dogs, and even though they are small, they have giant sized personalities. They're also a very popular dog breed. Pomeranians are one of the 15 most popular in the United States, and have stayed on that list for over a decade. Wow, how cool! Pomeranians are adorable. They can grow to be about seven or 12 inches tall, and weigh in somewhere between three and seven pounds. These pooches have thick, fluffy coats, and come in a ton of colors, like sable, red, blue, gray, orange, brindle, and even bicolored tan, white, brown, and balck. How cool! Pomeranians have pie shaped heads with pointy snouts which makes them look kind of like tiny foxes. They also have almond shaped eyes, pointy ears, and small bodies with curly tails. Aren't they cute? These adorable doggies are uber intelligent, very loyal, and even kind of independent. They aren't very demanding animals, but they will bond with their family and follow them from room to room to make sure they're near, should they want to give their pooch a rub. Aw! Pomeranians also love to be dressed up and travel with their families, either on foot, or in a doggy stroller. Isn't that sweet? Plus, because they're so smart and can learn tricks easily, they're extra fun, fun, fun! Nice, but what about some big dog breeds, Professor? These teeny, tiny dogs are like wind up toys. Can we hear about something we can relate to? Oh, you want the big dogs, eh? Yeah! Okay, Slobberstick. Try the Mastiff on for size! The Mastiff? Cool! Say hello to this big dog. The English Mastiff is a very large and awesome worker animal. Let's check out everything about them. English Mastiffs were created in England by breeders from a now extinct dog breed that was once known as Molossus. The English Mastiff came to America on the Mayflower with the pilgrims! Can you say colonial dog? These pooches are the 26th most popular dog breed in the United States, and are great and gentle house pets. But the English Mastiff is big. Fully grown, they can be 27 to 30 inches tall, and weigh anywhere from 140 to 220 pounds. My, my! These marvelous animals have short, sleek coats that come in light yellowish brown, light reddish brown, or sometimes yellowish brown with black spots! Breeders call this color combo "brindle". An English Mastiff has a really big head and body, and you guessed it, they eat a lot. If you have a Mastiff living in your home, you'll likely be going grocery shopping for you and the Mastiff quite a lot. For as big as they are, English Mastiffs are calm and very gentle dogs. They're super loyal, and get along with everyone, even other pets. Be warned, though. They are very difficult to train. They're overly sensitive and stubborn doggies, but they learn well from love and positive reinforcement. English Mastiffs can be kept in small houses and apartments because even if you have a huge backyard, this big fella would rather hang out inside with its family. Aw, too cute! Wow! What a big guy. Now that's a dog. Sure is! I thought you boys would enjoy that. And before we continue, no discussion of large dog breeds would be complete without touching on the German Shepherd. Guess what? You're about to meet one of the best dogs in the whole wide world! Not to mention, one of the most beautiful too. Say hello to the German Shepherd, and prepare for lots of kisses. Originally known as the German Shepherd Dog, this breed is one of the only ones to have the word "Dog" be apart of its name. Why? Well, that's a great question that has a pretty cool answer. Back in the olden days, being a German Shepherd was a job that lots of humans had. That's why the breed became known as the German Shepherd Dog so people could tell the difference when speaking about either the person or the dog breed. Pretty cool, right? You betcha. During the year 1889, a man named Max von Stephanitz started breeding what we now know as the German Shepherd. This happened at a dog show when he caught sight of a medium sized, gray and yellow type dog that he thought looked like a wolf. Developing this breed earned Stephanitz the nickname, "Father of the German Shepherd Dog". German Shepherd dogs come in many colors like black, sable, gray, black and tan, red and black, brown, black and silver, and even blue. How cool is that? Over the years, German Shepherds have grown in popularity all over the world, and it's become the second most registered dog in the United States of America. When it comes to a performance, there's not a whole lot that a German Shepherd can't do. They make great house pets, awesome guard dogs, serve on the force of both the police and the military, and even make incredible service and companion dogs. In a word, German Shepherds are awesome! Amazing dogs, those German Shepherds! On to the Rottweiler! Give us a Rottie, Professor. One Rottweiler coming up! It's time to meet not only one of the best watch dogs in the world, but also one of the most adorable! Get ready to say hi to the German bred pooch, better known as the Rottweiler! Rottweilers were created with protection in mind. In the olden days, they were work dogs who were employed to guide cattle to the market, and to pull heavy carts for both butchers and farmers. These dogs are strong, with a capital S. Rottweilers are the 10th most popular breed of dog in the Untied States, and make super great house pets, and of course, guard dogs. Rotties are fairly big too. An adult can grow to be almost 30 inches tall and weigh up to 130 pounds! Phew! Told you they were big and strong. Rotties have really smooth, short black coats, sometimes with brown markings on their adorable faces, and their super muscular chests and legs. Their heads are thick and sizable, with cute little triangle shaped ears on top. Some owners like to shorten or crop their tails when they're young, but we'll take these black beauties. Any way we can get them. Aw, how cute. Rottweilers are insanely smart, but along with that, they are super stubborn dogs. It can be easily trained as long as their humans are fair and firm. Rotties are sometimes related to being bullies, but that couldn't be further from the truth. These dogs are very cuddly, and happy to please their humans by being very loyal. They really do make awesome, loving pets. Rottweilers do not like to be alone. They are social dogs that want to spend as much time with their families as possible. Hey! Do you guys want to hear about Dobermanns? I'm sure everybody would love to, Slobberstick. Check this out! One of the more famous work dogs in the world is without question, the renowned Dobermann Pinscher, and there's a great reason for that. When it comes to getting a job done, few pooches are as capable, smart, and strong as this handsome dog from Germany. The marvel known as the Dobermann Pinscher was originally created in Germany way back during the 1890s. Breeders did so by combining around seven different breeds of dogs, including Rottweilers, Manchester Terriers, the German Pinscher, and even the Great Dane. Whoa! Why go through all of this trouble? Because the breeders wanted to create one of the world's best guard dogs, and they were totally successful. These incredible animals came to the United States somewhere around the beginning of the 20th century, and since then, they have become the 12th most popular dog in America, and it's easy to tell why. Not only are they incredible watch dogs, but they are amazing house pets. Dobermanns can grow to be anywhere from 24 to 28 inches tall, and weigh between 60 to 100 pounds. Now that's a big dog. These good lookers have a thin, short coat that ranges in color from black, to red, and even blue or yellowish brown. They all have rusty colored markings above their cute little eyes, on their necks, and of course on their strong chests. Sometimes though, you can even find a completely white Dobie. It's rare, but it does happen. Dobermann Pinschers have long snouts, medium sized ears, and super muscular bodies that end on a mighty long and usually wagging tail. Look at their little backsides wriggle, so cute. How's that for a fascinating and sometimes frightening large breed? That's so cool, Professor. Do any Dobermanns take classes here? We used to have a couple, Mugs, but they couldn't get along with our Great Dane students. Great Danes? Tell us more! Don't worry, I will. Ready to meet one of the greatest dogs in the world? One that's so great, it even has the word great in its name? Say hello to the Great Dane! These dogs are as big as they come. Great Danes are large animals that belong to a group of dogs known as working dogs. Even though they have the word Dane in their names, these dogs are not from Denmark. Great Danes came to the world from Germany. They were created by dog breeders over 400 years ago when they mixed old English Mastiffs with Greyhounds and Mighty Irish Wolfhounds. The result is a wonderfully fast, smart, and aggressive dog that were perfect for hunting animals including wild boars. Whoa. Over the years since their creation, Great Danes have become far less aggressive, because they aren't used for hunting anymore. Instead, they prefer to play with and protect their family. Great Danes are awesome house pets, and are often shown off in dog shows. These dogs are big. Great Danes can grow up to nearly three feet tall and weigh anywhere from 100 to well over 120 pounds. Wanna talk big? Check this out. There was once a Great Dane named Zeus who became famous for being the world's tallest dog. That's right. Zeus is in the Guinness Book of World Records for growing to a height of three feet, eight inches tall, and weighing 150 pounds! Now that's a big dog. Great Danes have short coats of hair that come in three different kinds. Black, black and blue, fawn, and harlequin. No matter what their color, they're all incredibly pretty animals, and are a sight to remember once you've seen them. These big pooches have giant heads that are long and narrow, and sitting on top of them are cute little floppy ears. Their bodies? Well, they are as muscular as they come. Even though they're large, Great Dane are also big, emotional softies. They're loving and calm and get along well with other dogs, and even cats. Great Danes just want to love their families, and they hate to be left alone. Aw. Surprisingly, Great Danes don't eat much, and don't need much exercise. Just walk them as you usually would, and they'll remain happy and healthy. How do you guys love the Great Dane? They're amazing, Professor. I have a Great Dane cousin somewhere in the Midwest. Oh, yeah! Cousin Marlon? I remember him. Hey, what's next, Professor? How about that super cool terrier? Yes, let's hear it! The adorable Boston Terrier is a lot of things. They're cute, funny, playful, absolutely loyal, and no matter what its name says, it isn't a terrier. Let's find out more about this fuzzy friend. Boston Terriers were created when breeders mixed the English Bulldog and the now extinct. White English Terrier. Since its introduction to the world, this beauty has become the state dog of Massachusetts, the official mascot of Boston University, and of course, one of the most popular dog breeds in the United States of America. How about that? Boston Terriers can grow up to about 12 to 17 inches tall, and weigh anywhere from 10 to 25 pounds. They have smooth, shiny coats that come in lots of colors like red, black, or even brindle. No matter what the color though, they all have white markings on their face and chest. So cute. These furry pals are also known as the American Gentleman, because their overall markings make them look like they're wearing a fancy tuxedo. So refined. Boston Terriers have box shaped heads, short snouts, large, erect ears, broad chests, sturdy muscular bodies, and very short tails. Know what really makes them stand out though? Their huge, loving, round eyes. Aw. Boston Terriers are very loving and gentle with extremely fun loving personalities. They're smart, too. Super smart, in fact. But they're also stubborn at times, nearly hyperactive even. It takes a long while to properly train these cuties, but once they are, they're one of the best dogs around. Boston Terriers are real athletes too! They're agile and can jump high, and even pull weights in doggy competitions. See? I told you they were strong as can be. Boston Terriers get along great with kids and other animals, and have been known to even learn how to ride skateboards. That's radical! When the day's activities are over, Boston Terriers like to chill out with their owners, and maybe even cuddle up on a couch. So cool! What's the next dog breed, Professor? The amazing beagle! Got any beagle cousin, anybody? Me! Oh, I have a cousin in about any breed, color, and size! I'm willing to venture to say that one of your favorite cartoon characters is Snoopy! Everyone loves him. Ever wonder what kind of animal this fellow is? Well, Snoopy is a beagle, and they've been around for thousands of years. The beagle was created over 2,500 years ago. Holy moly. This ancient dog breed came to the United States from the country of England during the 19th century. These beauties were bred to be great hunters of rabbits, hares, foxes, and even birds and fish. Wow! In fact, the beagle is still very popular with hunters, and they're still used as good and dependable hunting dogs. Beagles have super friendly personalities too. They're medium-sized animals that can grow anywhere from 13 to 16 inches tall, and a full grown beagle will weigh around 20 to 25 pounds. Everyone agrees on one thing. Beagles are awesome. In fact, they just happen to be the fifth most popular dog breed in the United States. How cool is that? You can spot a beagle super easily. They have really smooth coats that range from white, to black, to brown, and a mixture thereof. They have cute, little round skulls and long, super floppy ears. Their bodies are long, and pretty muscular for a dog of its size, and they have the sweetest little curly tails. And don't be surprised to see them wagging like crazy. They're so easy to fall in love with. Like Snoopy, beagles are super smart and curious. They're very friendly dogs who love going on adventures with their owners. Also like Snoopy, beagles are comically stubborn animals who are anything but easy to train. Still in all, they are very loyal to their owners, and that's part of why they've become so very popular. Beagles do have a tendency to get lonely, as they're a pack animal, and they hate being left alone. They actually like having other dogs to pal around with too. There's always time to play and get into a little mischief, right? Nice! What are we tackling next? Now I'm going to tell you all about the dogs known as Basset Hounds. Basset Hounds? Cool! Indeed, Mugs. Let's begin! Hope you have your traveling shoes on, we're gonna have to travel all the way to France to meet our next furry friend! The Basset Hound! Basset Hounds were developed and bred all the way back in the 16th century by French monks. These monks wanted a dog whose bodies would be close to the ground so they could easily pick up on the scents of other animals, both big and small. They may be short, but Basset Hounds are kind of heavy, standing at only about 11 to 15 inches tall, this beast can end up weighing anywhere from 50 to 65 pounds. Now that's a sideways fire hydrant. How did they get their names? Well, I'm glad you asked. I told you already that the Basset Hound originally came from France, so it makes sense that their names came from the French language. Basset comes from the word "bas" that means low in French. How about that? Even though Basset Hounds make great hunters, they're also so cute and sweet. These guys look kind of sad, but they're totally not. It's those deep set in face with loose skin and wrinkles that make them look that way. They're actually very happy animals with super cute, long ears, a very long body, and stubby, short little legs with really big paws on 'em. Take all that, and add in a tail that sticks straight up on their body, and you have the recipe for adorable. Well, adorable and loud. Basset Hounds bark and howl a whole lot. In fact, that's part of how the Basset Hound got so famous. A long time ago in the southern U.S., hunters and other owners of Basset Hounds would feed their dogs easy to make fried cornballs to quiet their barking buddies. These treats eventually became known as hush puppies, and now they're people treats! Isn't that funny? Over the years, Basset Hounds became very popular and they're features in lots of movies, advertisements, and even cartoons. They're so famous that they even have a brand of shoes named after them called Hush Puppies. In fact, Basset Hounds are still the official mascot of this popular, comfy shoe. How neat. Great! Bassets are so fun. Who loves bulldogs? Me! Did I ever tell you guys my cousin Tricks and... Let me guess. Cousin Tricks is a bulldog? Yup! What's a friendly dog that snores a lot while farting? Wanna meet that fella? I'm sure you do. We're talking about a bold little dog known as the bulldog! Bulldogs are great medium-sized companion dogs that were created way back in the 16th century when dog breeders mixed Mastiffs and pugs. The result of that mixing is adorable in every way. Bulldogs have sort of an unusual look to them, and because of that, you can always find them in movies and on TV. In fact, they're one of the most popular dogs in the whole wide world. A bulldog can grow to be about 12 to 16 inches tall, weighing in around 40 to 50 pounds. That's pretty heavy for such a small pooch. They have short, smooth coats that come in lots of varieties, but it's their cute little faces that make them so good looking. Bulldogs have wide jaws and short snouts. The skin on their faces looks wrinkled and loose, and the teeth on their lower jaws stick out over their top jaws. They have big, muscular shoulders, short bodies, powerful legs, and tiny little tails. Aw. If you couldn't guess by looking at them, bulldogs can be super stubborn. But with proper training, they can be very obedient, and also become great athletes. Though they are hardheaded, bulldogs are also smart, and become friendly animals that are perfect for families. Yes, bulldogs look heavy, but they're also pretty quick and agile. An adult bulldog can run up to 15 miles per hour and even jump about seven feet in the air! Whoa! Can you say "Air Bulldog"? They'd rather stay in the air, or on the ground, because these dogs are not good swimmers. So if you have a pool, just remember that little tidbit. Are dachshunds next? Yes they are! How did you know? K-9 intuition! Hot diggity dog! Our next barking buddy is a real wiener. Get ready to meet the cute little critter known as the dachshund! Dachshunds just happen to be the 11th most popular breed of doggy in the United States, and it's super easy to see why. They are adorable. Dachshunds grow to be about nine inches tall, and can weigh in anywhere from 15 to 30 pounds. Mini dachshunds usually weigh about 11. Such cutie pies. Dachshunds are super popular for being what's known as a wiener dog because of their short, stubby legs and their long bodies. They have two types of coats, either smooth, or long and wiry. Even cooler though, they come in at a whopping 12 colors, and at least different patterns like sable, brindle, or mottled. Dachshunds have long heads to match their long, muscular bodies, and are complete with a long tail. They have beautiful eyes and floppy ears hanging off their little faces. How darling is that? The name dachshund actually means "badger dog" in German. Why? Because of their incredible sense of smell, dachshunds were used to hunt badgers, foxes, and rabbits. Their tiny legs were made for digging, so they could get their prizes either above or below ground. How about that? Dachshunds are known to be very brave, they're also smart and energetic animals that have a habit of being pretty darn stubborn. Instead of listening to you, they would rather be chasing other animals or even birds. In a pinch, a nice, fun toy will keep them very occupied. They may be tough to teach, but holy cow, are they loving. Dachshunds have been known to bond with their human families super quick, and they always want to be a part of whatever is going on. They're just all around fun play-mates. Hooray for that! I had a play-mate who was a dachshund when I used to go to doggy daycare as a puppy. Yeah? Did you like him? Nah, he was annoying as all get out. I can see that! How about the Dalmatian, Professor Fetch? I'd guess you have at least 101 reasons to love our next dog breed, the Dalmatian! Not only are they superstars, but they're also some of the bravest dogs in the whole wide world! Dalmatians are also known as "dau". They're an ancient breed of pooch, but no one seems to know exactly where they came from, it's a mystery. Breeders and researches all believe that these wonderful dogs came to the world from the Dalmatia area of Croatia. Given the name, that makes perfect sense! Wanna know something cool? Of course you do! Archeologists have even uncovered pictures of Dalmatians on the walls of Ancient Egyptian tombs, and that means that ancient Dalmatians even scampered around Egypt! Whoa, now that's amazing. Today, Dalmatians are used as popular house pets and also as rescue dogs. For a long while, they were even known as carriage dogs because they have a super friendly relationship with horses. For many years, horses were used to help speed along fire carriages, and the Dalmatians have a cool ability to keep horses calm around fires. So, for the longest time, they've been traveling with firemen and other heroes to help get people out of danger. Talk about brave. A Dalmatian can grow to be anywhere from 19 to 23 inches tall, weighing in around 40 to 70 pounds. They have really short, smooth hair, and are usually white with black spots on them. Every Dalmatian has a unique pattern, and no two Dalmatians look alike. Now that's interesting. These superhero dogs have large, muscular bodies, thin ears, and super long legs with cute, round little feet. These dudes can run for hours without getting tired, and during the Second World War, they were used to send secret messages back and forth between troops. They truly were like the first animal spies. Now that's impressive! Dalmatians love to play in the water, and are very good swimmers. They require a lot of training though because they're also very independent animals who make awesome guard dogs. Wow! Dalmatians are so interesting! There's no other dog quite like 'em. Same goes for the pug. Did you know it's easier on the pug to raise two pugs together? I didn't know that, Professor. What else do you know about the pug? Let's find out! It's time to get cute. Our next kind of dog is as cute as they come. Get ready to meet the pug! A small, toy-sized animal that is one of the best companion dogs you could ever have. Pugs were bred about 200 years B.C. in China, and specifically for the Emperor, who wanted the perfect lap dog. How's that for important? Pug were created to be royalty. Pugs made their way to Europe in the 16th century, and became a very popular breed of dog. Now, you can find these little guys all over the world. Because they're so small and friendly, they make for great pals for just about anyone. No matter how old or young! These little dudes and dudettes grow to be about 14 inches tall, and weigh in around 14 to 18 pounds. They have really short hair, and can vary in color, but their cute little noses are always black. So adorable! Speaking of their faces, pugs always look like they've been squished in and wrinkled. This makes their big eyes all the more lovable. They're known for their adorable faces, short little legs, and tiny, curly tails. How cute is that? Make some room in your bed, pugs enjoy this one thing more than anything else. Sleeping. They get tired super easily, and will sleep around 14 hours every day. Don't expect them to bring that stick, ball, or bone back anytime soon, they don't really like to play fetch, and are actually hard to train because they're so stubborn. Pugs would rather just eat, sleep, love you, sleep some more, poop, sleep, kiss you, and then sleep some more, more than anything else! They can run about three to seven miles per hour, and for a four legged animal, they're notoriously bad swimmers. They may be small animals, but pugs have huge personalities. When they are awake, pugs are super playful and loyal. They're very interested in people, and will often follow their owners around the house to always be near them and see what they're doing. Pugs also love to lay in laps, and sleep with their human owners as much as possible. Aw! Incredible, Professor Fetch. We're learning so much in such a short time. It feels like my brain might burst. I don't think your brains can burst, Mugs, but they might get bigger, and we're not done yet. Bring it on! Oh my! You'd better have a pillow ready, because by the time I'm done telling you about the Energizer Bunny of the dog world, the Jack Russell Terrier, I can almost guarantee you're gonna need some rest. Jack Russell Terriers were created in jolly old England at the very beginning of the 19th century. These cuties are the direct relatives of what is now known as the extinct British White Terrier. Jack Russells are incredible hunters, but nowadays people usually keep them as companion dogs. If there's one thing that Jack Russells do better than hunt, it's be great friends. The Jack Russell Terrier can grow to be anywhere from 10 to 15 inches tall, and usually weighs around 14 to 18 pounds. They generally have white coats with black and tan markings, but sometimes can just be white and brown. Speaking of their fur, Jack Russells have three kinds of coats. Short and smooth, long and rough, or a combination of both. They have little eyes that are shaped like almonds, tiny, triangular ears, and small but sturdy bodies. And my goodness, is the Jack Russell active. You can even call them hyperactive! They just keep going, and going, and going, and going, and going. They love playing with balls, digging in the dirt, and of course, exploring. You have to teach them at a very young age how to be calm, or you'll own a friendly four-legged comet that speeds around your house insanely happy for the rest of its life. How about that? Because they enjoy running so much, the Jack Russell Terrier needs a lot of space. These little poaches need big houses and big backyards to run around. That's probably the only thing that will make them tired enough to sit still for even five minutes. Zoom! Jacks, so playful, so smart. Same goes for poodles, guys. Oh, poodles! So fluffy too. Time to check in with a cuddly dog who's super famous for having one of the coolest and most recognizable haircuts in the world. Say hello to the poodle! The poodles as we know them today were created in Germany during the 15th or 16th century, and they were originally used for hunting birds who hung out and made their nests around water. Then, very quickly, they became super popular in Europe, especially when it came to royalty. Well, could you blame them? Who wouldn't want to cuddle with a poodle? To this day, poodles are still very popular house pets. Not only are their appearances charming, but so are their personalities. There are three kinds of poodles, standard, miniature, and even toy poodles which are super small! A standard poodle will grow anywhere from 11 to 22 inches tall, and weigh around 60 pounds. Poodles have fluffy coats that come in lots of colors from black to blue, red to silver, and even beige and white. They have cute, round heads with long noses, cute oval shaped peepers, and long, flat ears. Their tails are also pretty noticeable too, as they stand straight up high. How cute is that? And get this, poodles are so smart. In fact, poodles are the second smartest dog on the planet, right next to the Border Collie. Whoa! They are really, really easy to train, and learn tricks super fast. Because they do learn tricks so quickly, they were a staple in circus acts of yesteryear. They can perform anything, even dancing around on two legs. Poodles are super loving animals and adore kids and other pets. They're also very loud. If you have a guest or someone comes to your door, they're going to tell you about it. They're loud but never mean. They are as sweet as could be, and that makes them perfect therapy dogs for people with handicaps, or of course, the elderly. How sweet. The Maltese is pretty cool too! I've always wanted to know more about those dogs. Well, here's your chance, Mugs. But be prepared for high levels of cuteness. Let's check them out. All right! Get ready to bow wow wow, because we're going to learn about pooch royalty. Here's one of the favorite dog breeds of the wealthy folks in the Mediterranean, the Maltese! The Maltese comes to the world from the island of Malta, where it enjoyed its status of canine royalty for a whopping 28 centuries. That's a long time! The Maltese came to the United States of America for an 1887 showing at the world famous. Westminster Kennel Club. Like royalty, the Maltese have a very refined and dignified look to them. They have small, cute little bodies, and silky straight hair that flows all the way down to the ground. Maltese are usually white, and their little black noses and eyes make them look simply adorable. Bless you. Don't worry, you're not sneezing because of the Maltese. These dogs have no undercoats, so they don't shed much, and are what's known as a hypo-allergenic dog. No sneezes around these little pleasers. A Maltese can grow to about 10 inches tall, and weigh around four to seven pounds. Most of that is probably hair. Their hair is so long that usually owners tie it in a knot with a bow just so the dog can see where it's going. How bout that? These dogs are super affectionate and lively. Got a camera handy? Well, good! Because the Maltese know how to ham it up around people. They want your attention, and will do just about anything to get it. The Maltese is a playful, fun, and full of energy dog, and yep, they will probably tire you out. Yikes! I'm pooped. You're right, Professor Fetch! The Maltese is crazy cute, and super smart too. Oh, can we check out one more dog, Professor? Schnauzers? Oh! Woo hoo! Time to meet another tiny dog. A mini one, even. Coming to us from Europe is the adorable Miniature Schnauzer. Let's learn all about them. Miniature Schnauzers are tiny little dogs that come to the world as part of the terrier family of animals. They were created in Germany during the 19th century when breeders mixed a regular Schnauzer with Affenpinschers and poodles. Mini Schnauzers make great companions and are also very popular show dogs. Currently, they are listed as one of the 20 most popular dog breeds in the United States. How cool is that? These tiny dogs can grow to be anywhere from 12 to 14 inches tall, and weigh in anywhere from 11 to 20 pounds. They have very clean and wiry double coats that are super thick! Their coat is usually solid black, or a combination of black and another color like white or silver. Miniature Schnauzers have snouts that are square shaped with thick hair on their faces. They have long, bushy eyebrows and long beards. How cute! They have a folded set of ears and sturdy bodies. Schnauzers have short legs that are super strong as well as having very short tails. So, how did they get their name? In German, the word "Schnauzer" translates to muzzle, and because the Miniature Schnauzer's furry faces are so recognizable, that word ended up describing them perfectly. In fact, their snouts are so popular they have kind of become their trademark. How interesting. Mini Schnauzers also have an incredible sense of hearing. They can hear sounds that are two times higher in pitch than human ears. How cool is that? These dogs are super happy, caring, and smart. But they are also pretty stubborn, and require a lot of training to become good house pets. And that about does it for today's class. We're done? So soon? We sure are. Did you boys enjoy your first day at Pooch U? - Yes! - Yes! Excellent! I'll see you both back here tomorrow morning then, and we'll continue our lessons. Okay! We'll be here bright and early, bushy tail and all. Professor Fetch, I don't want class to end. Is there any way we can have some homework? Yeah! My bones! In all my years of teaching, no students have ever asked to do homework before. You two really are serious about learning all you can, aren't you? Yes! Very well. I'll give you some homework on this topic. - Yes! - Yes! You both can do a round robin, brain blasting, doggy study session in the comfort of your own home. And we'll come back refreshed, reinvigorated, and ready to learn evermore tomorrow. Woo hoo! Let's go! Pooch U has already taught us so much about dogs, and it's only our first day of class. How wild! The semester's barely begun, I wonder what else we'll learn about. There's just no telling! Professor Fetch is like a mad genius, and the classroom is like his laboratory. Whipping up hot problem potions and solving doggy daydream dilemmas. Yeah! I love Pooch U! So do I. Let's go home and chew on some facts like it's an old chew. All right! My mouth is already drooling. Let's take a bag of kibbles to the living room, Slobberstick, and tackle some of these homework. What do you say? Okay, let's do it! We still got any of those old smoke flavored jerky bites? You bet your collar, Slobs! School is cool, Mugs! No doubt, Slobs! I feel like a dog genius already!
