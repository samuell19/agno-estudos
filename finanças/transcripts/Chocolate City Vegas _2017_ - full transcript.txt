[crowd murmuring] [Michael] It was little over a year ago, when I first started working at Chocolate City Nightclub. And it was happening. [crowd cheering] And a year later, yes. The club was suffering. As you know, it's no big secret that business has been down. And we're not pulling them in like we used to. That’s an understatement. And on top of that, looks like I'm gonna have to take a break from the club for a while. From this point on, I’ll be running Chocolate City. Now what Princeton hasn't told you yet, well, we're in the foreclosure. [Michael] So, the dancers came up with a plan that we could save the club. [locker bangs] Sorry, sorry. [Michael] But first, we’d have to find the money. We decided to go to Vegas and risk everything in the National Male Exotic Championship to win 500,000 dollars. Welcome to the Fifth Annual Male Exotic Competition here at the Legendary. [crowd cheering] [Michael] The dancers at the competition were amazing, but no match for Chocolate City. The crowd loved us and we were favored to win. We have the votes right here, ladies. [Michael] But then something... [crowd gasps] went horribly wrong. But let's go back to the beginning. On why it's important to always play by the rules.

Look, um, he's not talking about it much, but Princeton's having some real problems, man. Like what? Money, mostly. His dad's been sick and he's been spending a grip on hospital bills. Rumor has it that, uh... He might be losing Chocolate City. He hasn't paid a note on this building. [car honking] My ride's here. I'll catch you later, man. -All right. -Thanks, Magnus.

And I got a master plan. Sure. Thanks, Dee-dee. Yeah, wait, wait. Hold on. Hold on. Now I don't know if I should be doing this because I feel like such a traitor. But read this. What's this? There's a big old Vegas show coming up for strippers. -Wow -Yeah. All these stripper teams. It's like a bid ol' naked... Bring It On for men. Where'd you get this? Online. It was an advertisement on a porn site I was on. So, I'll talk to you later? Bye! Hey, thanks, Dee-dee! Hm. [Carmen] No, Dee-dee. I told him if he keeps dancing, I can't be with him. I know, Carmen, but it's clean dancing. It's not even like he's showing any of his you know, male parts. It's still stripping. Okay, well, what about you managing him? What? Since you don't wanna date him, it's the next best thing. You always organized. You so serious. And you got a bank account. At least, until Chris gets back from New York. It'll be strictly professional. -Did you talk to him about this? -Yeah. You're the one who suggested it. Yeah. Anyone of y'all seen my guitar picks? No, but I got an afro pick if you need it. Come on, man. Every week I lose one in here. Y'all need to stop stealin' shit, man. For real. Hey, Pretty Boy, ain't nobody stealin' your guitar picks. Well, somebody. Anybody lose a pick? My bad. All right, everybody, gather around. Big announcement. [sighs] As you know, it's no big secret that business has been down. And we're not pulling 'em in like we used to. That's an understatement. Well, on top of that, looks like I'm gonna have to take a break from the club for a while. What's going on? Well, you know my dad's been sick. But now he's taking a turn for the worse. -And I need to be there. -Oh, man. I'm sorry to hear that, man. And while I'm gone, Brandy's gonna take over for me. From this point on, I'll be running Chocolate City. Now, what Princeton hasn't told you yet, is that, well, we're in the foreclosure. Foreclosure? Yep, the bank's looking to foreclose if we don't come up with 88,000 dollars by the end of the month. [sighing] Which brings up this business opportunity that Michael shared with me. All right, listen up, fellas! We got a chance to go to Las Vegas and compete and possibly win the National Male Exotic competition. Male exotic competition? -That exists? -Yeah. It exists and it's in Vegas. I'm not interested in that. That sounds corny. -Well, me either. -Whack. Count me out. -Yeah. -Chilling. Look, Princeton. I know it's a bad time to be telling you this, bro. I've been working on this new song, man. [all mumbling] First prize is a half a million dollars! Yes, a half a million dollars! [Bolo] Wow. -Oh. -Hey, man, I could buy me a new guitar. Exactly, that would get us out of foreclosure and give every dancer a nice paycheck. Look, I think we can win this thing. All right. We're better dancers, we're sexier. All we need is a kick ass routine, some costumes, some great choreography, and we could take this thing home. Yeah, well for half a million dollars, I'll choreograph our routine and your church's praise and worship. [all laugh] Not so fast, Alvin Ailey. I think we need to stick with the routines we already have. So, we're going to Vegas? Well, here's the catch. All right, you need 5,000 dollars to throw your hat. -What? -Oh, man. And I can't sponsor you 'cause I just don't have it right now. You know what. I think, I know someone who can get us that entry fee. Aha! So, let me get this straight. Y'all fools looking for donations to go strip in Vegas for a half a million dollar stripperfest? It's a respectable tournament. And besides, we were told that you are the only one that could afford to sponsor us. -Who told you that? -Michael. Michael, who? The guy that used to work here. Light skin, blue eyes. Oh, well, still can't help you. Wait, before you say no. it's a way of giving back. You could help some brothers fulfill their dreams. You could start off where King left off. Come see me back here in three months. -Come on. -Oh, come on. Why isn't Michael here? He really doesn't like you. [speaking in Spanish] Makes it easy. Wait. Now, we've been supporting you by eating here for years. Throw it up. We'll give you 30 percent of the half a million. Forty. And you buy the airplane tickets? Yeah. First class, baby. [motor revving] [Katherine] Mr. Williams got you on the short bus? Son. Are you sure about this? All right look, I'm sure, Mom. We need the money. Like I told you earlier, this is a great opportunity. And we could save the club. Well, you just make sure you don't do nothing in Vegas, that needs to stay in Vegas. -All right? -Okay, Mom.

Well, how do you like the show? -Man, you killing them out there, bro. -Yeah, I know. Like this whole thing is revolved around you. Like, literally, you're like a star out there, man. And plus, you getting that white money now, man. Yeah, white women love themselves some Pharaoh, baby. You know that. [knocks on door] Five-minute warning, Mr. Percy. I got it. Wow.

Yeah, man, what's up? You think you can hook me up with something like this out here? You mean with the Hippz? Yeah. Yeah, I think I can make that happen. Look, look, Bolo. You're a star. You don't need those dudes, man. They just riding your coattails, baby. What you need is a solo gig. Like me. Pharaoh. Solo. You really think so? Yeah, but, Bolo. You gotta get rid of those Chocolate City guys, man. Get rid of them? Dump them. Leave them. Don't show up. Go home. Let me push a few buttons out here, all right?

[cell phone rings] [sighs] Hi, Mom! Sorry I didn't call earlier. It's okay, baby. You staying away from 'em thots? Mom, you really gotta stay off social media. [chuckles] Look, I got a visit today from your French teacher. -Professor Lyons? -Mm-hm. Your French state exam has been pushed up to the 18th. Wait, the 18th? Mom, it's the same day as the competition. I can't make it back right now. I know. I know. Professor Lyons, he's trying to find a solution for you. [Michael] Mom, I can't graduate without it.

[upbeat music] [giggling] Hello, gentlemen. Now there's no need for any lengthy introduction. You already know who I am or you wouldn't be here. And I don't need to know any of your names because quite frankly, I just don't give a damn. Why don't you give me my drink, baby? I'm doing a salute for your boss, Mr. Princeton. Who asked me to see if I could point you cats in the right direction. So that you can actually be contenders in this competition. He seems to be under the impression that you may be in over your heads. That you think, that you can just come down here, and do that same old, H Town, knocking boots bullshit you do at Chocolate City. I'm here to tell you that you can't. You see, this isn't about you just shaking your asses in front of a bunch of fat chicks named Big Sherl, TT, and Shamrica. This is the Academy Awards, gentlemen. The stage of stages. And if you think it's anything less, well... You might as well take your raggedy asses back to Atlanta. And eke out a living for another dollar. [slurps] [groans] We're a little hungover. -Are you a dancer? -Hell no. I'm the player who shows the player how it's done. You need to run your Google. All right, ladies, have a seat. Have a seat. Sit down. Time is money. Let's see what you got. What right here, right now? Yeah, right now. Let's go! [upbeat music] All right, all right, that's it. Stop, stop, stop. That's it, that's it, that's it. Sandra, what's your thing? Cute. But no. [Best chuckles] Needs a lot of work, fellas. Lot of work. So when do we get started? Right now. Here. You call this number, immediately. He's the best. Off you go. Good luck. [sighing] Chocolate City. They ain't got a chance in hell. [drill whirrs] [clanking] Gentlemen! You've been sent here to me by Mr. Valentine to whip y'all into shape. And that's exactly what I plan on doing! Now onto the rules! [chuckles] There'll be ten finalists chosen from hundreds of applicants, and I mean hundreds. So don't get your hopes up. To compete in two days of competition at the Legendary Hotel. You'll be judged on performance. Sexuality, if you have any. Costumes. And audience reaction. Yeah. If you're lucky, that's only if you're lucky, Mr. Best Valentine might acknowledge you. Serious male exotics know their money is their body. So we take care of that. The gym? That's our friend. The muscle has to be defined. The women. They associate your sexual prowess! With bulge and definition. [exhales] We never cheat on our bodies! We serve it so it severs us. [grunting] The harder we push it the further it takes us. Good. And when they touch it... Oh, when they touch it... [grunts] All right. They are rewarded. [grunts] Ninety-seven. Ninety-eight. [grunts] Ninety-nine. Come on! One hundred.

We're gonna have to go on without him. -We can do that? -We don't have a choice. It's in God's hands now. [sighs] Damn it! [applause] That's right! It is in God's hands!

Uh, no, looks like we lost one of our dancers. -[Pastor Jones] Sometimes things don't... -How the hell do you lose a bromance man? Oh, Lord. Forgive me. [Katherine] What are you gonna do? I don't know, but looks like we're gonna go without him. Hopefully, no one notices. [Katherine] It'll be fine, baby. Son, when the world throws you a curve ball, you just pick up that bat that God gave you, and you swing it. [Katherine] You hear me? -Thanks, Mom! -Good luck, son. [relieved sigh] My son's gonna swing his bat. [applause continues] Yo, we're supposed to be ending with this routine. Why are we starting with it? Cause this is the only routine we have where Bolo doesn't have a solo freestyle. And Pretty Boy, you gotta close the gap between you and Addiction. And hopefully no one's going to notice. Okay, cool y'all, you want me to bring my guitar? [all] No, man! Come on, man. Hey, Budge it. Wow. It's real out there. Man, fuck Bolo! All right, we're after Heaven's Boys. Which means we're sixth.
