It's not your problem if I get sick, so mind your own business! Tell my mother for all I care, she won't say anything. Oh shit! Come on everybody! What time do you call this, Mr Boglio? I'll let it pass this once. You, recite your homework. Andre Nicole Ok, that's enough. Bring me your exercise book. Boglio, show me your weekend homework! Is oat grown in your area? Your answer... yes. Beetroot, yes! Rice, yes! Tomatoes, no! There are no tomatoes? What about fruit and vegetables? Yes, gladioli! Tell me this, are you trying to be funny, saying there are no vines? Is that what you call homework?! I didn't do it, sir. Who did it then? Maybe the Dad did? Maybe! You have to come to school. The teacher wants a word with you. Come on, the change will do you good. Carry on without me! Where do you think you're going? Hop on the back. Just walk out from us? He did all my homework. Sit down. So you did it? I see you missed out on your education. "We walk". Walk doesn't take an 's' in the plural. Page 24, "The blazing sun ripens the wheat." Let me explain, Sir. I'd like to explain to you. What's the subject? Wheat is the subject in this sentence! Wheat is the subject and the subject is wheat! So Napoleon said: 'Let my white panache be your rallying point'?! Well, I did get my leaving certificate. Stay right where you are. Here? There!
