Come on, go! Dad! - You're not wearing your sailor suit? - The weather is not so good. - Who said so? - Mademoiselle. - Shall I take a puff pastry? - No, the boy prefers mocha cake.

You will scold her for me, she still doesn't come to my Thursdays. She doesn't! I'll remind her. Poor Marthe, I don't see what we could talk about. But as she will never come. Have you seen how the Mandines' kowtow at Cardinaud? They were quite happy to find him. Don't blow, inhale! And hurry, mom is waiting for us. - It's strange being here. - It must be. You'll pick me up? I'm counting on you. Don't worry, see you later. Oh well, gosh! - Mimile! - Well yes, Mimile. - How is mother? - She's fine. We were talking about you two days ago. Where were you? In Africa? Yes, in Port Gentil. No, it's not next door. I took a small tub to come back, what a trip! Why did you come back? I came back because I was homesick. Raymonde, come and help me, will you? Coming! Can't I talk to my brother? - Are you talking about Mimile? - She is! Hello, Alphonse. - What's new? It's been a long time - You're the one who should say. So? Did you make a fortune? It would be made. if I hadn't been homesick. - A muscadet for Antoine. - Here. Africa, you know, is no better than the rest... - You will give me back my twenty grand? - Give me time to settle down. I have lots of projects. In Port Gentil, I had a reputation Here too, you have one. The cash desk is closed! Thank you, Raymonde. - Have a drink, it's my round. - I'll have white wine. Where shall we go in the afternoon? We'll go for a walk with mum in Fouras. As usual. You could go alone, with mom and sis'. And what about you? I will go to the cinema with Mademoiselle to see a Mickey Mouse. - I got the reward of merit! - Don't we know! You'll go to see the picture if you don't drag your feet. Not sleeping yet, are you? She wanted to kiss you before going to bed. - Come on, go to sleep. - The boy has lunch at the table? Yes! Reward of merit. Marthe! - Marthe! - Madame is not here, sir. - She went out? - No, she didn't come home. - She didn't phone? - No, sir. Oh? Well... Let's sit down and eat, Mom will be here soon. This afternoon, we'll go to the cinema, won't we, dad? Yes... of course, since you got the reward of merit. Pass your plate, Jean. Thank you, mademoiselle Go on without me Madame must be at her parents', I'll go and see. MASONRY VAUQUIER Come in! I'm telling you to come in! Oh sorry! I thought it was the neighbor. I apologize, Sidonie. Pay no attention to the mess. Sunday is a day of rest, we mustn't upset the Lord! - Certainly not! - To what do I owe the pleasure? - It's about Marthe. - My God, she isn't sick! Not at all. But as she was late for lunch, I came to see if she wasn't here. Alas no. She was supposed to call, but she must have forgotten. - Sit down. - No thanks. Children have no conscience... She doesn't care that her poor mother can't read in bed at night! She was supposed to bring you books? No, 10,000 francs so that electricity wouldn't be cut off. If I counted on Julien, he hasn't brought back one cent all week. What? I had him have a job at Molestier's. Well, I didn't see any money Julien's getting worse and worse! In the past, it was only pastaga and shagging... Now he's started playing billiards, all our money goes! - And how much is it? - What? - The electricity bill. - 8420. Well! You must doing sound and light shows. I don't think I have any change, I'll give you back 10,000 francs. So much simpler! It's a man like you that I should have married! She is lucky, my daughter! By the way, where is she? - If I only knew! - Yes, you wouldn't be here... - Well... goodbye, Sidonie. - Goodbye, Fran?ois. Thank you. Hello, Mademoiselle? Monsieur speaking. Madam is back? Not yet... You have eaten, haven't you? So take the kid to the movies, they're showing a Mickey Mouse. He will tell you where it is. Good Bye. How much do I owe you, Mrs. Pinsard? A kir, a telephone: 60 francs. - Here! Goodbye. - Goodbye, Mr. Cardinaud. - He didn't drink his glass! - Don't worry, he can afford it. L. CARDINAUD Basket Maker Forgive me, it's me! - Hello. - Hello Fran?ois! - Hello Mom. - Hello. You're paying us a visit? It's better because it's rare. Sit down! - Want something to eat? - Thank you, I ate. - I came to see if Marthe was not here. - No. - She didn't call? - No. Your wife visiting us? That would be new! I understand, to each his own environment. When you live at Porte Neuve, at Les Minimes, there is no profit to be made. She might be at her parents'? You should go. - I've just been there. - He went there first, of course! The Vauquiers come before the Cardinauds! Come on, mother! Pay no attention, the mother is getting old. I'd say she's becoming a ball-buster Becoming? Ha ha! She always has been one! Maybe it's because she likes us. You haven't come to see her often lately. It's work, pal! Aren't you rich enough yet? Your wife didn't go to mass with you, did she? No, she goes to low mass. It's shorter. - She might be back now. - I phoned 10 minutes ago. She may have gone to the Mandines' though I doubt it. I'll ring them. No, it's your brother, they having coffee with Mauricette. They come every Sunday! - Hey, here's bro! - Hello, Tuthur, how are you? - I'm fine. Dad... - Hello. - Hello, Mauricette. - Mr. Cardinaud. - What! Mister Cardinaud? - The Big Shots impress her. - Big Shots! What are you talking about? - Hello Fran?ois. You don't say hello to uncle Fran?ois? He grew up, the nephew! Hello Coco. I'll say hello and goodbye, I have to go home. Do come at home one evening! - All right... goodbye, mom. - Goodbye, Fran?ois. - Goodbye, Dad. - Wait, I'll come with you. - So see you soon! - Goodbye, uncle. Kiss granny! Hello, mom. Come, I'll take off your raincoat. What brought him to us? It's because of Marthe, she forgot to come home for lunch. Fran?ois thought she was here, can you imagine? Marthe may be called Cardinaud, but she's still a Vauquier! So what? Nothing. Yes, go ahead, say what you think. The Vauquiers are the Vauquiers, they don't live like everyone else. At lunch, Sidonie is in bed. At bedtime, the Julien is at the bistro. Don't forget that Marthe has lived there for 20 years! She has been living differently for 12 years. You can't judge a book by its cover. And the Vauquiers are sneaky. We had warned him, he wanted a Vauquier, he's got one! Well... he's got one... She may have been detained, without being able to warn. It happens. You'd better not try to do the same! He may be worried because of the children, I could go and look after them during the day. Look after them? But there is a nanny, Mademoiselle. I don't understand why he's running after her! If Mauricette did something similar, I wouldn't do anything but when she came back she'd hear me! When I come back from work, I want the soup in my plate. Soldering is hard work! We know! You say so every Sunday! Goodbye. Have a banana. - Who was it? - Cardinaud. He wanted to know if his wife was here. I wonder why she would be! She could be here, my dear. Cardinaud is our equal. - He is! - Oh no! Please! He slipped into your office, but he is not our equal yet! I don't find Marthe so unsympathetic. I've never seen you find a woman unsympathetic especially when she is common. But I don't think your brother...? Do you, Charles? Duleux! Mr. Cardinaud, you're abandoning low speed today? I'll ask you a silly question, have you seen my wife? Oh no. She had to go see her godmother in Niort, As she was late, I came to see if she hadn't missed her train. I would have seen her, she must have taken the bus. Yes, that's right, you're right! Good Bye. What can I do for you, Mr. Cardinaud? Was an accident on the public highway reported today? I'll see... Mrs. C?line Malabry, 72, knocked down by a motorcyclist. - Would that suit you? - No. I was worried that one of our clerks had had a run-in. What's the name of your clerk? A name in Nou or Ner, but since it's not him... I could have phoned to Les Sables, La Pallice... No, no, that's fine, thank you. Goodbye, Lemer. Goodbye, Mr. Cardinaud. Look, your brother! - Excuse me. - Sorry. Hey, you're here! - You see, we also come here. - Sometimes on Sundays. - Marthe is back? - Not yet. - Are you having something? - No, thanks. Yes, you will have a drink with us. Sit down! It's strange that Marthe didn't come home. Like I said to the father, I could have worked into the offices, don't forget! If I remained a welder, it's because of the salary. So that Mauricette and the little one want for nothing. But, at home, I want accuracy! Are you having something, Mr. Cardinaud? No thank you, Julien, I'm fine. I may not have an important job, but I have self-esteem! Trust me, if I were in your shoes... In my shoes? You jerk! Well! Money doesn't teach politeness. Well.. Good evening, Mauricette. Even so I told him about the electricity bill. It's not only electricity. If they cut off the gas, we can't eat! Grub is essential, isn't it? 9250 for gas. I wonder what you do with the gas! And I wonder what you do with the money. I live my life! Because I don't have charges. While he has us! It's still unfortunate to always have to ask! I've never left my parents in need! Your mother died in the hospice, and your old man with the nutcases! Indeed, but I visited them. Whereas I will have to go to him Dad's coming. It's time to tidy up now. - It's late. - Madame didn't ring? No sir, no news, good news! - You were nice, were you? - Yes, dad, very nice. Good! No, I'll get it! Hello? Speaking. I hope I'm not disturbing you? Fr?minger phoned me, tomorrow there will be 80 tons at auction. You'll be there? As usual, why? To save my brother from going to the Gabut, he must go to Rochefort. By the way... is Mrs. Cardinaud back? What's the relationship? None, none, of course. So, can we count on you, my dear? Good... Good evening, and again my apologies. Madame is at her godmother's, in Niort. She can say she scared us! She will. What about the cinema? It wasn't Mickey, it was Pinocchio, we laughed, didn't we? Yes. Will Madame come home for dinner? She didn't know yet, her godmother is sick. She has asthma, so you know... So, tell me. - Pinocchio is a wooden doll, and it becomes a real little boy, thanks to the fairy. - What's the fairy called ? - The blue fairy. Shall I wait for Madame's return to put them to bed? I said she didn't know when she would be back. Excuse me, I'll give them their bath. You know, dad, the blue fairy comes through the window then with her beautiful magic wand... 55000. - 56! - 60! 60000, 500. - Mr. Cardinaud. - How are you? 65,000, at 65,000 francs. 66 to 66,000 francs. 66,500 francs. 67, 68. At 68,000 francs. 68500. 68,500, at 69,000 francs. No one tops it? Awarded, Michaud! 69000, Michaud. Ladies and gentlemen, please? The four crates... 55,000. That's 50,000. At 50, 500! 55000 55500! Mr. Cardinaud, Ourillon has a batch of Marennes oysters are you interested at all? - How much initially? - 25, 35000. - Oh no. - Joignard takes a third at 25,000. I'll take everything at 20,000. 55,000... 56,000 francs. 56,500 francs, 57, 58... 58500, to 59500... 62... 500... 63, 63500... 64500... - 65! 65! At 65,000 francs, 500... 65,500 francs. No one tops it? Souchet! What shitty baskets, Always the same! Damnit! He's such a pain in the ass! Mimile could still have stayed longer with his mother! Two years! I only saw him to get tapped from 6000! - Don't cry, he'll give them back to you. - That would surprise me! - What the hell are you doing here? - The boss wants 10 kg of hake. Come, we'll fix this. The four crates of hake, 80,000. - 75! - 78, 500, 79, 500... 80, 80500, 81, 81500, 82, 82500, 83, 83500, 84... - 500! - 84500... - 85! 85, at 85,000 francs... No one tops it? Sold to Cardinaud. 85000, Cardinaud. The four boxes of various, 15,000. Yes, 10! I'll be damned! He knew that I needed it! Why didn't you bid higher? He distorts the rates, we should get together and complain to the President. - He is the President. - To the union. - He is the Union! Oh my God, it's all for cuckolds! Hello, Cardinaud. - Shall we do business together? - Yes, at 25. - No, at 20. - That's a fine pack! - But I believe you, buddy! - So, we agree? - Yes, at 20. - Joignard takes a third at 25! - I'll take it all at 20. - Okay, so... - See you at the office later? - Okay. At this rate, how much will he sell it per kilo? 500 francs. 500 francs? Before the war, I had 10 kg for that price. Why didn't you buy, Mrs. Babin? The clock has stopped, what time is it? 8:05 a.m., honey. Well Titine, what about my hakes? We'll buy from Cardinaud, come on, let's go! - Good morning, Mr. Cardinaud. - 'morning, Fabier. Mr. Cardinaud, Th?venot is waiting for you. Mr. Cardinaud, bad news... - The Cainus broke its shaft in Ol?ron. - Oh shit... Should we tell Mr. Charles or Mr. Hubert? What's the point? Actually, Mr. Cardinaud has just arrived. - Th?venot. - Good morning, Mr. Cardinaud. You told me to come see you. - You can use my first name. Sit down. - So? - Well... I'm really annoyed! Ah, you're something! You leave 300,000 worth of nets and 200,000 worth of cable in the sea, and you're annoyed! Very kind of you, but that's none of our business! The insurance will work. The insurance, will work up to 50 per cent. You will pay the rest? With what? The boat is yours, the equipment is yours. Come on, Fran?ois, you know me! I am not a beginner, I've done this work for 26 years I know the coast like my hand! If I got hooked, anyone would have got hooked! Alright, I'll fix that, okay. That's nice, you're great! Go! - Thank you, Fran?ois! - Good bye. - So? - So what? - Marthe sent you? - No, Sidonie. What? Sidonie? she got the ace of spades? - She forgot to tell you about the gas. - How much? 9250 francs. Gibert, have 10,000 francs given to my father-in-law. - Thank you, son-in-law! - Bye. Come over here, sir. - Good morning, Mr. Charles. - ' morning. - Good morning, Mr. Charles. - 'morning, Fabier. I told you to turn off the light at eight. It's past eight. Congratulations, my dear. I heard that you took Montillon down a peg this morning. By the way, where are we with Th?venot? I just met him. It's settled. - He will pay? - No. Ah, well, so much the better! You are not unaware that he is a leader, an extreme left-wing bastard, master before God and the whole shebang! I get rid of those black sheep! Phew! Yes, but I didn't get rid of him. I beg your pardon? He's a top-notch fisherman, that's rare! I don't care that he votes far left if it doesn't tilt the boat! The 300 for equipment are half covered by the insurance! I don't agree! I believe, and my brother too, that Th?venot has a debt... What! You've never had any debt, have you? So? All right, perfect... since you make it a matter of friendship, I won't insist. Yeah! Right: I will tell Hubert that I agreed Yeah! Right! I don't want to be forward, but I saw you worried yesterday. You're all right? Any news from your wife? Yes, my wife is in Niort, with her godmother. - You recognize the place? - Not really. Wow! Everything has changed here, not just the owner. The premises too. When you think of G?g?ne's time... G?g?ne, the little arbor, the lemonade and mint... Chinese tango, my first high-heeled shoes, - my first lipstick. - It tasted like polish! I had bought it from the cutlery merchant. It's funny, I remembered everything, but all is different. Yet look, the privets are still there. The dance floor too. And the arbor... The difference is that before, there were flowers. But it's not the season. We should have seen it three months ago. The truth is that we saw this ten years ago. Anyway, the room is clean. Yes. - You don't look happy. - I am. You find it gross? It's a room like all rooms. Like all those rooms, yes. Of course, it's not Cardinaud bedding. It's not your big shack with a view of the park. Though if you liked it so much, hey? Oh, forgive me, my dear Marthe! Forgive me I spoil everything, I talk nonsense! Because I love you too much. That's why I'm mad at him, I've always been. You can't know the feeling when a woman you love is with a successful guy. You die! For example... At night, when you were in my arms, you asked me why I was smiling. Well... I felt like I was taking something away from him. I've waited ten years for this... You can't imagine how long it is. You know... when I received your first letter six months ago...I cried. Yes, yes, I swear! It felt so strange. It felt even stranger to write it, believe me! I shouldn't tell you this, but I wrote it as I would jump into the water. I didn't know what to do because you were my former boyfriend. That's called loyalty, right? You'd better find another word. Let's call it memories of youth. - Oh, youth... - No, you haven't changed! You are my girlfriend from before. What is it? It's noon, are you leaving the room or are you keeping it? We'll keep it! - Got what it takes? - You bet! I tapped Titine for ten thou. Why are you laughing? Because you haven't changed either, Mimile! Good evening, sir. - Nothing new? - No. - Ah, yes, Mrs. Cardinaud phoned. - So? Mrs. Cardinaud mother. Mademoiselle answered. - My mother called? - Yes, to have news of... Well, for news. I told him that Madame was in Niort, at her godmother's. She was surprised because the godmother has been living in Paris for 3 years. If you don't mind, Jean will dine in his room, He came home with black marks, he is punished. Should I tell Marguerite to prepare your bath? Mademoiselle... My mother has her ideas, and you've got yours. As for your ideas, I couldn't care less When I say Niort, it means Niort! That's how it is.. In any case, here, that's how it will be. You got it? Tell Marguerite to run the bath. Very well, sir. Well, I've been told about your behavior Black marks for behavior. What did you do this time? I spoke with Maille and Philippon. Those two again? Couldn't you hang out with nicer boys from time to time? Eh? I don't know, the Ardouin son, the Mandine son? Ah, Mandine, he looks like his father! Well then? Well, his father is nice. The other night at dinner, you talked about him, - You said a bad word! - I did? When a dad swears, it's for fun, and a well-behaved little boy shouldn't listen. First of all, I don't argue with a punished boy. The result is that you will dine alone. You too, you are going to dine alone! Say, when will mum come back from Niort? Soon, surely... - Shall I help you with your homework? - Oh, yes! Let's see, you've got some problems here. You don't blame me for earlier? About what? When I got angry about Niort. It's all the more stupid that everyone knows about it. Everyone, well... let's say quite a lot of people. Some people made allusions? This morning at the auction, I was called a cuckold I was wondering where I was, Mrs. Babin found the word! Mrs. Babin known as Titine. I didn't know her, but she's quite a character. Without the discovery of sulfonamides, she would infect the whole area. This kind of character doesn't mean what she says. Oh no, not Titine! If she said that, she meant that! The funniest thing is that it seems to rejoice people They are delighted! And you, do you find that normal? Will you allow me to speak frankly to you? No one is embarrassed, so go for it! They say that twenty years ago, you were a longshoreman in the port. So what? Today, this port belongs to you, or almost! You're feared and you're hated. They say you only succeeded with fangs and claws like the wolves. They're probably exaggerating, but do you know what they also say? From the ferry terminal to the lock, only water that does not belong to you. Because it belongs to no one. Else, you would have taken it. I thought about it... What else are they saying? That the Mandines only stay in place because you let them. Or rather, because Mrs. Mandine has sex with you. What! Isabelle Mandine? They think so? Well... holy crap! You're right, they really hate me but why for God sake? Because of everything! Those who knew you as a longshoreman don't forgive you for no longer being one. Those who employed you, whose boss you are, would you like them to adore you? You are insatiable. You should be delighted to be hated, that's what success is! Well then! Well anyway... tomorrow morning, the wolf gets up at 6 o'clock. It's the La Pallice day, and which is more, a trawler broke its shaft I have to go get the expert at Chateldrillon. I'll drop the kid at school, it's on the way. All right, sir. Let's go! Excuse me, I would like to ask you a question. What will you do if Madame returns from Niort? I will do my best. Couldn't you take the key! Oh sorry, Madame, I thought it was Cl?mence, she went out with the children. Ah! The children are not here... They left early so Jean could get some fresh air before school. What about Monsieur? - Monsieur? - How is he? As always. On Mondays, he goes to the auction, on Tuesdays at La Pallice. Yesterday was Monday, he got up at 5 o'clock to go to the auction, today is Tuesday, he is at La Pallice. Madam didn't know? Madame had a good trip? Hello? Hello? There's a lot of noise! Can you hear me? I won't be coming home for lunch because of the expertise. Yes... Nobody phoned? Yes, Mr. Hubert, about a consignment, he will phone again. I will go to the office. Beside that, nothing new? No, no, nothing. What was that? The office, asking for Monsieur. It happened while we went into reverse, we probably coiled some wrack. We probably maneuvered a little sharply. You did indeed maneuvered sharply! - There may have been a little wear. - We'll see that. You fix it for me ASAP! - Yes, I promise. - My regards to Mr. Mandine. - Thank you. Fran?ois! Oh! Fran?ois! Cardinaud, listen. Drouin! Long time no see! Come up, I have something to tell you. I'm busy, I'll see you tomorrow. Come up, it's important! All right, quickly then. Drouin's boat is detained, but for you, Mr. Cardinaud... - Good, thank you. - You're welcome, Mr. Cardinaud. Come this way, we'll be quieter. How long since we last saw each other? Seven years? Eight years? Well, something like that. I can't say you haven't changed. - I gained weight, didn't I? - You were never thin, man. That's right, but the fat didn't eat muscle! The king of pliers! Do you remember? We were quite a pair when we were twenty! We gave it to a few! The Puerto Ricans at Fat Gaby's, six that we threw in the water! What a life! - What happened to fat Gaby? - She died, five, six years ago. - Poor old woman, what did she die of? - Of this! You don't say! It's because she wanted to stop too fast, it's fatal! D?d?, what did you want to tell me that was so important? Your wife, how is she? What, my wife? I know, she's gone. And do you know who she left with? With Mimile! Mimile? Titine's son... It can't be! It's true though! They all know it. And no one told you. It's normal, you're the cuckold... And you are someone important. You've become a V.I.P., so it's party time in the village! Mrs. Cardinaud with Titine's son! Of course, everybody's laughing! Except me, believe it or not! And if I'm not laughing, it's because I'm even more of a cuckold I'm not telling you this to be nice to you. Mimile owed you nothing, he owed me everything. You can't imagine what scoundrel he is. When I picked him up in Port-Gentil, had pinched from every place. Only, over there, there are men! Not bourgeois! Mimile was excluded from the white district. Outcast, he lived in a native's hut. When he found out that I was leaving for La Rochelle, he came out of his hole to beg. If you don't take me on board, I'll die! On his knees, he spoke to me of his mother, of his diseases! Anyway, during the crossing, he discovered a cargo of absinthe in the hold. He wanted to blackmail me. I kicked his ass! Another would have understood, but he is vicious. Barely landed, he ran to the customs office. The officers showed up, I couldn't even unload the wood! Without counting the lawsuit, I'll be fined and kicked out of the company You will do what you want, but I want to off him! Tonight, I'll go ashore to do it. We will find him! I swear that we'll find him! We might find him, but it's not your Mimile I'm looking for. Since they are together, it amounts to the same thing. And I know where they are. At least, where they were yesterday. At the bar des Charentes. Vittorio, the driver, drove them there Mimile's sister works there. She serves lemonade between two tricks. Titine's children are really top class trash! Where are you going? - Here, the same. - Yes. Tallyho, here's the dicor! What the fuck is he doing here? - I kind of suspected that. - Perhaps to get off with Raymonde. Mr. Cardinaud, what do you want? - I would like to see Miss Babin. - Ah, you're out of luck. Today, she is with a trick, Hotel Printania, with old Couderc. - You know, the sardine fisherman. - Yes. All right, well, thank you. Shit. Tuesday... It's not Couderc, it's... Oh, who cares? Half past five. I'll be at the office at a quarter to six. In love as in business, my motto... is fast and good! Is that why you keep your shoes on? Exactly! You know the proverb, lost time can never be made up for! I also know another. A debt paid is a friend kept Quite right. Thank you baby. Miss Babin is in number 7, but you can't see her. I know, she's with a trick , but I must talk to her. - Well, see you Friday then. - Half past four. Excuse me, Hubert. Did you forget something, baby? - I thought it was... - May I? What do you want? Chat for five minutes. You call that chatting... Baby calls that taking a nap! That good old Baby, I could tell a lot about him. Oh, not as much as I! I didn't come to talk to you about him. - But about Mimile. - So? - I would like to know since when... - Marthe and Mimile? Always. They were playing hopscotch together on the Vauquiers sidewalk You must have played it, too, ten years before. We've all played it. You got out of it, I stayed. Basically, we're from the same sidewalk. Later, Mimile and Marthe went dancing on Sundays. Mimile started pinching in Titine's bag to pay for the green mints. Afterwards, he broke into the cashdesk at Montillon's to buy a ring. - Was Marthe his mistress for a long time? - She might never have been. At that age, you have time to waste, you talk about the future, you remain virgins. As for your wife, you must know better than I. Then, Mimile got in trouble, he went to Gabon, to Port Gentil. And he probably got in trouble over there, since he came back. Well then! If he came back to be out of trouble... And where is he? I won't tell you that. I'll know when he is murdered It's a matter of hours, someone's looking for him. Not me! Crime of passion is not an investment for a family man. It's not worth going to jail for scum of that sort. Scum? In the meantime, your wife's in his bed. You will take her out of it? Let's suppose so, I wouldn't like to find Mimile's body on the bedside rug. - Drouin... - Yes! Thanks for the tip. I don't know where they are. If you learn anything, ring me. Where? At your place? Of course at my place. After what happened, I couldn't care less. - I was afraid you wouldn't come. - I promised you! - Have you been home? You saw him? - No. - What did you do? - Nothing. - Did you think of taking some money? - No. How are we going to pay for the hotel? - What are we going to do? - I don't know. Never mind... - Sir, Mr. Mandine's here... - He can go fuck himself! I'd rather Monsieur tell him, he's in the living room. Good evening, Charles. Good evening, excuse me this intrusion, but we've waited for you. - I was at La Pallice, buddy. - I tried to reach you. You're here, that's the main thing. There's a big delivery tonight. - Yes. - About a hundred tons. I could go, but I have the flu. - If you could replace me. - I'll go to the Gabut in one hour. Thanks my dear. Bye. And pass on my best regards... around you. Take good care of your flu! Good evening, sir. We'll have dinner early, I have to go to the Gabut. Marguerite, you will clear the living room, and tell Cl?mence - that Monsieur wants to dine immediately. - Fine, Miss. "The miraculous catch", my painting, where did it go? Forgive me, maybe I was wrong, I took the liberty of putting it elsewhere. - Where ? - In the attic. - Of course, if you prefer... - Why, was it so trashy? - Awful... - It was a wedding present. - I didn't know... - Oh, it doesn't matter. You know about painting? I've studied at the Beaux-Arts for a year. No need to be an expert, it is obvious! I tried to do for the best. Put it there, Marguerite, we'll help ourselves. Why are you looking at me in this way ? I changed my hairstyle a bit, I can remove the bangs. Oh no! I think that for that too, you are doing for the best. The kids had a good dinner? Yes, but the sweets had somewhat ruined their appetite. - You give them too many. - I didn't, Madame came. What ! She came ! And you tell me that now? She arrived right after your call, she wanted her green suitcase. She didn't said anything ? She's never spoken much to me, so now she... - How was she? - She had her gray coat on. Not what she wore how was she physically? She looked happy, but in a hurry. She was afraid of missing her bus. Because she had to take the bus? The children were at the garden with Cl?mence... - You won't go out without dining? - It doesn't matter, I'm not hungry. At least take a coat, you'll catch cold. Thank you. Well well! Fine Arts did you good. In addition to painting, you seem to know the score. NO ENTRY RESERVED TO SERVICE I don't remember... Alfred! Have you seen a female traveler with a gray coat? No, I didn't pay attention, why? - A relative of Mr. Cardinaud. - We'll ask Bernard. Have you seen a female passenger with a gray coat in your coach? at 6 or 7 o'clock? There's no coach to La Pallice at these times. Maybe it wasn't the Pallice coach. If she didn't take my bus, I couldn't see her. Thank you. Goodbye, gentlemen. Good day sir. What's the matter with Cardinaud? Looking for a relative at this hour? Come on, it's over! Yesterday, something funny happened to me! Quai Duperr?! Guess who I saw. Thank you... Fat Jeanne! - What will you drink? - Red wine! I'll tell you that tomorrow, cheers! Thank you, Huguette.. - Hello, gentlemen. - How are you? - Good evening, Mr. Cardinaud. - Hello. - Give me a toddy. - With orange blossom. Hey! I'm glad to see you, Mrs. Babin! - I'd like to talk to you. - So go ahead. We are listening to you, my good sir. I'd rather see you at my office, or at your home. I am at home everywhere, especially here. What do you want to know? I would like to know where Mimile is... You are very curious! I am going to tell you... Mimile is on honeymoon! Maybe in Ch?telallion, maybe in Venice, How would I know? Lovers travel. You should have news through your family? So no one writes to you? Say, Titine... If there's no one to shut your mouth, I'll do it! Not in jail yet, are you? If I go, it won't be for what you think. When you get there, what do you want me to carry to you? You will be in mourning, my fat one. If you look for trouble, D?d? will be ready - Are you having anything? - No, not here. I came here because I saw your car outside. You'll put that on my account. - Another round! - Yes, me too, the same. Another one for the road? - Pass me my glass. - Here, lad! Huguette! The same thing! You got news at the Bar des Charentes? No, no news from there. You're not what you were, Fran?ois, you've changed drastically! When I think of what you once were... Of course, I don't wear shorts any more! In '36, when you gave it to fat Fernand, you weren't wearing them anymore. But you didn't dress as a bourgeois yet! With your hat, you look like a vet! You think you look like an admiral? I'd tell you what you look like, but Titine has already told you. Raymonde too, if you want to know everything. And I even gave her money to tell me that. Excuse me, but I have become a bourgeois. I have my chair in church and gold in the bank. The bourgeois's role is to be winded up, maybe because of the hat. But you've seen nothing, what matters is how you use it! Because I have the most beautiful tip of the hat in town, hey! See? It took me twenty years to sort this out! And that is nothing! You haven't seen my face at weddings or funerals! This is where I shine because I go to all of them. I am in every clique. When an official kicks the bucket or marries his daughter, I'm there! And you think monkeying around as you do will help you find your dame? Aren't you monkeying around too? "If you look for trouble, D?d?, the king of pliers, will be there!" Your plan to shoot Mimile isn't monkeying around? Having climbed the ladder to end up in jail! - You asshole. - It's better than ending up like you! If you're afraid to get dirty, I'll take care of Vittorio! He'll spit it out, Mimile's address, I promise! Mr. Cardinaud, Mr. Hubert is looking for you at the Gabut. Go and give him the notebook him, it's ready. Come on, get on! So, the "king of the pliers"? - So, motherfucker! - Hold on! - Where's Mimile? - Listen, Drouin... Captain! If you don't mind! See? He is looking for trouble. And I'm there... - So where's Mimile? - At the Petit Robinson. They're at the Petit Robinson, that's where we went dancing He did too, apparently. Get in there! Nothing can replace the good old methods! I think of the cry Mimile will utter. We'll catch them in their lair! In their lair! Ah, Mimile's look... If we're lucky, we'll catch them in the sack! I swear that they will hear the alarm clock ring. Will you shut up for a while? Instead of ringing the alarm clock, you will stay in the car. - You mean you'll prevent me... - From doing something stupid. I do. If I don't, you'll appear before the criminal court not the Magistrate's The Criminal Court uses good old methods too. You'll stay here, got it? I'll tell Mimile to come down later. All right but only because it's you. - Ah... Hello! - Yes? - I would like to speak to G?g?ne. - G?g?ne's not here anymore. He handed over the business to me. You need a room? Yes, Emile Babin's room. They left last night without paying. The lady left her suitcase. - A green suitcase? - Yes, here! How much is it worth? 14,650 francs. And how much is the bill? 3,500 Two, three... There you go! - Good bye. - Good bye. So? So... I don't know where they are! I swear! If you had spoken earlier, we wouldn't be in this situation. You decided then. So we are empty-handed and will have a 30 kilometer drive Go on like this and you'll walk back. I'm fed up with your LP Biceps, sermons, Bossuet and "Les Miserables", that's enough! The four crates of soles, 80,000 70... 75... 500 71500... 72500 73500... 74 75...500...76...500 77.50078...500...79 - 80 80,000... 500... 81... 815000... 82 at 82000... No one tops it? Matra! What about me? What about me? The three crates of hake... 500... 95... - 95... 500... - 100! 100,000... 500 101... 500...102 - 103! 103... 103,000 francs. No one tops it? Testmaret! Why is Mandine gesticulating? They wouldn't let him buy. He's furious! It'll teach him a lesson! Come see! Good morning! - What are you doing here? - I was waiting for you. Why didn't you come inside instead of freezing outside? Mother is not sick, is she? I received a letter from Marthe. What does she tell you in her letter? That poor Marthe doesn't seem to be very happy I have done everything, haven't I? You may have overdone it. Overdone! What do you mean? Did you ever wonder if your wife liked watching you grow. Your brother's wife married a fool she ended up with a moron. it didn't break her routine! But Marthe... Marthe married Fran?ois. And you became Cardinaud! So you understand... It's as if you'd left her after 2 or 3 years of married life. - What is it? - Should I wash the car? - Can't you leave me alone? - Oh sorry! So you mean... I'm the one who left. Does she tell you so in her letter? No need for her to tell me. - I've got some experience. - And imagination too. May be. Do you know a card game called "The Marriage"? It takes two to play. It's very simple but on condition of letting the other play. While I weave my baskets, your mother runs the shop, she takes care of the soup When I'm sick, she takes care of me. Women like to take care of us Did you only get sick once? You can't think of everything. You would have taken a nurse. I wonder why you got married, you never need anything. Yes, she says so in her letter. What of yourself did you give her? One or two years. Just the time when you stayed in the little house at Les Minimes. Marthe was used to small houses She had married a little guy from Les Minimes, and she finds herself with a company of trawlers. Climbing high is quite nice but it makes some people dizzy. The thing is, she found someone who needs her. She doesn't love him! She will never love him. But he needs her! Hello, the Trade Association? Can you put the president on? I don't care about your General Assembly. Put the President on. I too know a game that takes two to play: war! Maxim? Cardinaud. To check on a license, I would need... You're fucking with me with your General Assembly? Just because I catapulted you President doesn't mean you're presiding over anything, right? So... You're going to summon Titine Babin for license check. Yes, I want her in an hour at my office. Got it? Well, goodbye! What an ass! All right, have a drink. I'll shave quickly and drop you off at the bus. - Hello dad! - Slept well, sweetheart? Look what mom brought me. Take one! You can have two, you know. - Oh, Grandpa! - Ah, Jean! Hurry up! Marguerite is waiting to take you to school. It's okay, yes? - Hello sir. - Hello ma'am. - Goodbye, grandfather. - Goodbye, my little Jean. The Mandines have been waiting for you all night. I too have been waiting for you. Are you leaving already? Yes, and when I come back, I want to find everything in its place, the painting in its frame and you in your coat. Why do you think I pay you? - To take care of the children. - We agree and not to make you one. You are expected, Mr. Cardinaud. Please come into my office, Mrs. Babin. Oh, there you are! You've got us in trouble! We've waited for you until 7. with 80 tons of mackerel on our hands. Finally, we were forced to sell to Joignard. You can imagine at what price. My brother and I will not bear the consequences of your failure. Your mouth, baby! It's time for your nap. Tell me, what is that? Warm regards? Warm! Why? "Best regards" is enough! You don't want me to kiss him, do you? It was told that you wanted to see my license! You hope you'll find your wife's address on it? You'd better think of something else! One woman, no more woman! That's life, poor you. But what are you doing? You're crazy! One license, no more license! That's life, poor you! You do not have the right to take away my livelihood. I'll complain. It's arbitrary Tell me where your son is hiding. You want Mimile's address. You think that I, his mother, will give it to you. I do! Why? Precisely because you are his mother. Mimile gave Drouin to the police. You will give me Mimile You are that kind of family Betray my Mimile, never! You will! You will! You must admit that your means are not clean. What do you want from him? Oh, I? nothing! It's Drouin! Drouin's a badass, Drouin. If I tell you where Mimile is, will you'll warn him? And you'll have me get my license back. - For my license, it's a sure thing? - Yes, Titine. They're on R? island, at the Hotel des Touristes. You're free to go. You find me disgusting, right? Does that surprise you? Send me the errand boy. Turn right and follow Titine. Go see the time of the ferries to R? island. All right sir. You wanted to fuck me, huh? But Titine doesn't only talk to you. Especially when she got punched in the face. Gentlemen... Leave it, I'll pay. All right, you stay here. You wait for me. You're kidding, aren't you? I said: you wait for me. To stop me, you'd have to knock me out. So what? It would be new. You have a short memory, mate. You spoke of when we were 20, I kicked your ass a lot then. When you pulled the cord, you got a good telling off You're just a big mouth and I can still smack your mouth. You'd better smack your whore's face and... You bastard! She's gone. I don't know, it's useless... I tell you she's gone... You can see that she's gone. Where? Strange question! Where could she go? To your house... She has a home. Yes indeed, she has a home! Excuse me, I didn't go to Africa to make a fortune. I planted my home here. 12 hours of work a day for 30 years, it has to be for something. I know that money doesn't buy happiness but live in shit either. My poor Mimile! Well, what? What, poor Mimile? I hear you from here swear to love her forever To love all life, it is not enough to rent a room for the day Getting laid is nice but life is not just that little thrill Work of flesh... but afterwards, there's the kid. After all, kids are the norm and logic of life During intermissions, they think about it... And also to the fridge, to the washing machine then to the linen closet. It's our strength in the homes, the linen closet Next time, try to think about it. Come on, farewell, Mimile. Ah, by the way, I forgot... Drouin is on the island. You had better get the hell away. Drouin! What do you want me to do? I don't have a cent. Where do you want me to go? I don't know... In Africa! But in another region. Oh shit! - Have my car taken care of. - OK sir. It's you! - You see, I was going home. - Yes I know. That makes you laugh... You certainly don't know why I'm laughing. - I have an idea. - Oh, surely not. Do you remember when we were like these two, looking at the sea dreaming of furniture on credit. Only happiness, you see, is paid for in cash. You can tell by the fact that for 12 years, we shared a bedroom but didn't share dreams But it's my fault, I forgot you on the way. Now that we know the route, we're both going to do it again together, but... cushy, as if we were going to take our driving test So listen... there is a vacant house behind St ?loi 4 rooms, a large kitchen, a single maid's room Perfect for the holidays, you could come every night. It's for sale. Well, it's sold! Here! You want a sweet? English subtitles by shakill
