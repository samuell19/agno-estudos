Woman: Hello? Hello? Man: Where the hell are we? Dog: Uh-oh. Sweetheart, are you all right? Miranda, please, I'm gonna slash my throat here. Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah! - Mom, help. Mom, help. - Hold on. I don't believe this. Josh is gonna be here any minute. That gallery guy hates me already. - When did you meet him? - I didn't. But I can feel his negativity from here. God, I forgot how small this place is. - "Feel his negativity." - Honey. I know, I know. - You missed a spot here. - All right, thanks. By the way, love you. Emma: Don't leave, please. I just need five minutes to get everybody downstairs for the picture now. Miranda: Oh, Mom, can we do it later? I've got to get out of here. Emma: I have to send an overnight mail as it is. Miranda: What's this one for? - Emma: They're looking for a family to represent prunes. - Miranda: Prunes? We're all meeting downstairs for the picture. Okay. I see. How do you feel about that? Mm-hmm. I see. How do you feel about that? - Here, Gerald. - Let me ask you a question. Does this sound okay? I see. Well, how do you feel about that? It's very sincere. It's the same damn thing every time, Doc. I see her in a kitchen chair right in front of the TV... ...with her legs, you know, open. And she's looking at me, licking her lips, just like in the movies. So I says, "Sacha, give me a break, all right? I'm trying to watch the fucking game." And she says, "Blue dogs will inherit the moon." Now, what in the fuck is that supposed to mean, Doc? We ain't got no dog. What happens next? Patient: She starts to unbutton that old flowery-type thing. What do you call that? A housecoat? Housecoat? Yeah, yeah. And then-- and then she starts taking the rollers out of her hair, real sexy-like. Rollers? Patient: Now, my Sacha is as strong as an ox, but she ain't exactly what you would call a looker. Anyway, she takes off the housecoat and I see her tattoo, except now it's got the name Hugo where my name used to be. So I go nuts, right? And I rip the TV out of the wall unit and I throw her and the TV right out the window. Patient: Looking at her down there, dead and all, I start to think... ...that was one hell of a lady. Hey, does this shit mean anything, Doc? I mean, it's supposed to mean something. Oh, what the heck, Doc? The insurance pays for it anyway. Might as well check it out. Look, man, I'm not no fucking fruit loop. Right? Doc? I see. Here she comes. - Woman: Uh-oh. - Man: Oh, boy. What? - Well, let's get out of here. - What? He called my stuff pornography. Just 'cause the sculptures happen to be of men and not women and just 'cause they all happen to have erections. Sweetheart. Come on. These-- this is not an erection. This is a military weapon. You can wipe out entire European countries with these things. A lot of men like big breasts. I don't see what's wrong with a woman being fascinated by large penises. You chicks are supposed to say that you don't care about that stuff, see? And we guys believe it. I mean, it's basic. You lie and we love you for it. Honesty is gonna fuck up the whole system. Leave it to me to find the only heterosexual gallery owner in the entire western hemisphere. God, I hate men. You get all the power, we get all the pain. It so sucks. God, I wish I had a penis. Believe me, women got it easy. Puberty, pregnancy, menopause-- that is a piece of fucking cake compared to living with a dick. - Trust me. - Aw, poor baby. You have to live with a dick. I'm serious, you always got to be thinking about it. Take pants for instance, okay? Now, suddenly you have a penis. Where are you gonna put it? I mean in your pants. Where you gonna put it? Are you gonna put it on the left, on the right? Are you gonna run it up along the zipper? Are you gonna stuff it in your underwear? Maybe you're just gonna let it dangle and take a chance on surprise boners in the middle of the grocery store. Chicks are always giving us guys shit for thinking with our dicks, okay? But how would you like having a part of your body that just grew to five times its normal size any time it wanted? - I-I'd like it. - Yeah. - Come on. - I would. Imagine-- all right, you're talking to a guy, okay? And you're thinking, "This is nice. He's pretty cute. I'm having fun." All of a sudden, kaboom! Your tit pops out right in his face. - Whoops. - That's it. That just blows your chance of playing it cool all to shit. That is why chicks have the edge. And another thing is-- let's be totally honest here. Penises are pretty fucking ugly. - No, they're not. - Yes, they are. Why can't they just make one that's just straight? I like them curvy. Sweetheart, there is an entire dick subculture out there screaming for artistic representation and I think you're the one to do it. - I mean it. - Thank you, Josh. Emma: Honey, they're here. Come on and get your sister. What's that sound? I don't know. Miranda: Oh, I'll be right there, Mom. What? What? Oh, shut up. Mr. Swade. Roger, please. I just wanna get this straight. Roger: Emma entered our network's contest, your family won. What did we win? You're all going to be famous. You see, the boundaries of television are changing. And our network plans to lead the way with a new show. Your show. They were searching for the average American family. So, um... All right, so you want to put us on a TV show? No, Mr. Webber. You're gonna be the TV show. We propose to pay each of you, 150,000 per season. $150,000? Roger: $600,000 for the entire family. And, of course, if the show is a success, well, you can always renegotiate. What do we have to do? Roger: Just be yourselves. We'll move you into a beautiful, new home where we've installed a few cameras and, well, we'll simply record your daily activities. What would you record? Everything-- totally real, totally uncensored, first of its kind. It's one of the benefits of cable television. When would we get the money? I mean, if we did it, I mean, you know-- when would we get the money? The network would have to hold onto your salaries in an interest-bearing escrow account until the end of the season. You see, we wouldn't want our average American family to turn into the Rockefellers right before the audience's eyes. It might distance you from the audience, emotionally speaking. Now, Gerald, Gerald, no, no, no. Gerald, I-- I understand. All this is new to us too. We'll just simply have to... feel our way through this thing together. Look at you. You represent the ideal American family. Gerald, Emma, Miranda, Johnny... Oh, God, I love that look. It's so real, it's so raw. I wish I could capture that look in stone. I cannot take another night of this shit. I sneak in here so your father doesn't hear. We watch the stuff, it gets me going and then you just lay there like a dead fish. Aw, come on, Joshy. Don't be like that. Let's cuddle. I do not-- I don't want to cuddle. I want to make love. What is the point of you making me bring this stuff over? - It's driving me nuts. - Well, Josh, I told you. The only way that you can really know a man's body is during sex. To really know the muscles, to really know the bones, you-- what? What? Oh, wow. Where are you going? I got muscles and I got bones. Come here, my little muscley, boney thing. Come here. Come to Miranda. Come here, my little Joshy. Hi. Gerald: I just feel like I'm losing control. Of what? My life, of thoughts, of family. Everything. Maybe we should take this TV thing. Maybe it would help hold us all together. I love you, sweetheart. I miss that bear sound. - I don't make a fucking bear sound. - Yes, you do. You make a little sound like... Come on. No, I don't. Stop it. Miranda. Josh: Stop it. I love that sound. - Really? - Yes, I do. - Yeah? - It's the cutest thing that I ever heard. If you move back in with me, I'll make it all the time. - Josh. - I'm sorry. I'm sorry. All right? I'm sorry. - It slipped out. Sorry. - It's okay. It's not you. It's just that, I don't know, to me, the whole idea of commitment, it just feels so sad and final. It's like when I finish a piece of art, I stand back, I look at it, I'm expecting to feel contented, but I never do. Instead of feeling happy and satisfied with this beautiful thing I created, I usually just feel like I wanna cry. Why? I don't know. Maybe it's because when I'm doing it, I'm pouring all my passion into my art, so it's like I'm in love. I'm in love with this beautiful thing that I'm creating. But when I'm finished, it's just a thing-- it's just a thing that'll sit on a shelf somewhere, get dusty, and eventually be forgotten. I don't want that for us, Josh. - That is such bullshit, Miranda. - No, it's-- You have to commit to something at some point. Don't do-- what are you doing? I don't like when you stare at me like that. It makes me nervous. Don't do that. I'm not staring at you, Josh. Do you know what I'm doing? I'm memorizing your beautiful face. See, this way, I have it imprinted in my brain and then every time I close my eyes, I see you. - Yeah? - Yes, every time. Every time you close your eyes, you see me? Yes, I do. Well, then fuck the TV thing, then, and move in with me, please. I mean, I-- I will never mention the C word again, I promise. Miranda, give me a chance here. Please let me love-- Don't say that, okay, Josh? It just sounds corny and dumb. Ha! All right. That's fine, okay? So, I'm dumb, then. All right? I'm a corny, dumb shit who loves you, okay? Who loves you more than anyone else ever has or ever will. And you won't say it, but you love me. - I do not. - I love you, all right? - I love you. I love you! - Shh! - I love you! - Shut up. - You're gonna wake everybody up. - Miranda, I don't care. I'll wake up the whole freaking house if I have to. Hi, Daddy. Hi, Mr. Webber. Don't blame her, blame me. Good-bye. Good-bye, Josh. Miranda: I think it would be incredible-- all those people watching us. We'd be like exhibitions in a museum. Our whole lives would be like works of art. We could use a bigger house. What do you think, Johnny? I think we're all gonna end up dead with maggots eating our eyeballs for breakfast. - God! - Personally, I'm looking forward to it. You are so sick. I mean, I'm sorry Janet died, but I think it's time you got off of this jag. I'm sorry my misery inconveniences you. You guys can do anything you want. I don't care. Johnny. Johnny, come on. This thing could really be great. He just needs time, that's all. So, what do you think, Daddy? What are we gonna do? Do you think they'd let us take Grandma Harper's sofa? - I love that sofa. - Em. We can't say no. It sounds exciting. We've never won a contest before. Well, then. Come on, this is serious. This could put a lot of pressure on us and Johnny doesn't need that right now. Johnny: That's right, I don't need that right now! Johnny. Johnny, this could be a really great thing. You just don't know it. I say we do it. I mean, I think it would take his mind off Janet. Don't you think? And you know what? If we wait too long, they're gonna ask another family. You know what? I think that Johnny would even benefit from this. All he ever does is mope around. He could just as easily mope around there as he can here. In fact, he will probably mope better in a bigger house. Oh, look at that! Gerald: How often will the show be on? Roger: Seven days a week, 24 hours a day, The Webber Network. We'll do some edited episodes, but we'll rely heavily on live telecast. Emma: Oh, honey, look, a waterfall. It's so quiet in here. The eye of the hurricane. We have tried to make the technical workings of the show as unobtrusive as possible. Gerald, Emma, Miranda... Johnny, meet Mike and Billy. They'll be heading up the technical support team on your show. - Billy: Hello. - Mike: Hey, how are you? Mike and Billy will be monitoring the cameras and the recording equipment in the house. Uh, I don't understand. Well, you see, we have a room downstairs where we'll be keeping an eye on the monitors. Their job is to maintain the equipment, camera lights, microphones. If anything should need attention, they'll come into the house and they'll fix it. At night, after you're all asleep. Absolutely. As a matter of fact, if all goes well, you'll probably never see them again after today. Mike: Just think of us as elves with tools. - Well, we better get back. - Yeah, right. Okay, well, you folks take care. - Bye. - Excuse us. - Bye. - Thank you. Pleased to meet you. Gerald, this is one of the camera plates. The camera itself is built into the wall, but all you'll ever see is the plate, which hides the lens. There are 45 plates built into the interior walls of the house. But there are only 20 cameras actually behind them. Um, which 20? Well, that's-- that's the whole idea. You see, you'll never know which ones are real and which ones aren't. Or when the real ones are on or when they're off. Well, then how would we know which ones to talk to? Oh, no, no, no. Miranda, we don't want you to talk to the cameras. - No? - No. No, we want real life, not acting. - Oh. - Don't worry. After a while, I'm sure you'll all get used to the cameras and forget they're there. Karen, why don't you take Emma and the kids and show them their room while I take Gerald and show him his new office? Sure. It's all yours. It's beautiful. Go ahead, Gerald. What are all these books? Just props. Now, Gerald, when you bring your patients here, we will have already have them sign a release. So there's really no problem there, but-- Wait a minute, why would-- why would I bring my patients here? Because this is where you will see your patients from now on. Well, I think I'm the one who should decide. Gerald, I hope you don't mind, but we took the liberty of informing your clients of the change. But we only found files on six patients. Gerald, where are all the rest? A lot of my old patients have-- have moved. Oh, I-I see. I understand. We'll bring in some new blood. Hell, everyone wants to be on TV, right? Emma: Hello? Would you like a sandwich? Hello? Would you pass the peas, please, Mother? Yes, dear. Thank you, Mother. You're welcome, dear. It's a lovely meal, sweetheart. Thank you, honey. You're welcome, dear. Mike: Jesus Christ, this is bad. Billy: Well, how would you like to be watched all the time? I know it'd make me pretty nervous. Give them time. We'll only use the good stuff anyway. It'll be great. Oh, no, no, no. Don't do that. Why not? They can see us. Okay. I'll turn off the lamp. No, no, uh, uh, uh. I think that's an infrared camera. Woman: They know something we don't-- dogs. Cats too, but... they don't really care, so they're not the primary danger. The danger? It's just the illusion of our entire culture. I see. They've been sent here by the albino in sandals to spy on us, to listen, learn our secrets and report back. We think they're sleeping all the time, but they're not. They see everything. And they hate us secretly. Everything about us, especially our shoes. So how much more of this shit do we have to watch? What is that? - It's a dead bird. - Miranda: Oh, gross! Emma: Put it in the trash or-- or bury it. Gerald: All right. I think we've all had enough. We all liked Janet, but this obsession with death, - it's just gotta stop. - No. You can't tell me what to feel or when to feel it. Heads up. Looks like we've got some action. This pain, it's mine. It's all I have left. I mean, you guys think you're so in control, but look at you. I mean, this is all bullshit. See? I'm not acting. This is how I am. I don't care what you or anyone else thinks. Two weeks and they've got you trained, jumping through hoops to make them think we're the perfect family. You people make me sick. You're miserable, so you just wanna screw everything up for everybody else. Well, thank you, Johnny. Thank you very much. Emma: Johnny, the cameras. I don't give a shit about the cameras or the money. Dad, Dad? You don't even smoke. Now, if anyone's got problems, it's all of you! Fuck! This kid's got big fucking problems. Announcer: We searched the country for the average American family. After analyzing 50,000 essay entries, we chose the family that best represented what America stands for-- the Webbers! This is your family, America. Welcome to "At Home with the Webbers." - Hey, what's this? - It's a new show about a real family. Oh, yeah? Cool. Hey. - He's cute. - Shh, shh. Who does he look like? He looks like someone. - He's gorgeous. - He's a geek. Whoa, who's the babe? Are you sure it's the right channel? Maybe it's not the right channel. All I had to do was look across the table and see you... Narrator: ...conclusion that although pigs may not be the perfect... It's just static. Mom, the channel is... - 8-- 8 at 9:00. - It's on-- I don't believe this. We can't even watch our own show. How else are we gonna know what they recorded? Hey, could somebody out there do us a favor? Tape one of these stupid shows and send it to us? My sister is a little insecure. Thanks. They hate us, secretly. Everything about us. Especially our shoes. Gerald, this has to be a matter of trust. If you were to see yourselves on television, you might become more self-conscious, and that wouldn't be very good for the show now, would it? No. I didn't want to bring this up in front of the others, but, well, your section of the show has received the weakest response. Oh, I see. Now don't get me wrong. They like it. Oh, they like it very much, Gerald. But the difference between like and love is what we're after here, and I want them to love you, I mean really love you. Now, Gerald, I know the real you. I know a funny man is inside of there, a funny, sensitive, yet a strong man, who is the backbone of this family. Strength-- I think strength is the key. When you first talked to us about the show, you said, you wanted us to be ourselves. Reality, that's-- that's what you said you want. Yes, yes. But, you see, there's a difference between truth and reality, and I want truth, truth with a capital T. Now, what would happen if... if you primed your patients a little bit? Cut to the real root of their problems. The juicy stuff? Yes. Yes, yes, exactly. Gerald, I'm not asking you to change. No. Not really. Alter, maybe. Not change. Strength-- strength is the key. Emma, this smells delicious. It doesn't seem fair. You get all the dirty work. Oh, well, I don't mind. I think they were right. - Who? - The audience. We received a lot of letters on the show and... oh, now, I don't want you to take this the wrong way, but, well, they felt that your potential was underutilized. Oh, I'm sorry. Oh, no. Now, I've done it. I've hurt your feelings. It's just that, well, they see you as, as a more independent woman. Glamorous. Me? Glamorous? They see your potential and so do I. Well, you can laugh if you want. I see you as an emerging butterfly. Do you see what this guy is doing? And who cares? I'm not gonna keep this stuff anyway. I guess you don't mind working for an asshole. Over here, my sculptures, are over here. I made-- I made it all. What can I say, they are-- Oh really, Mr. Swade, really? You really think so? The audience sensed this in you. Sensed-- sensed what? All this incredible sexuality. Huh. You could be the next Madonna. Really? No, bigger. Bigger than Madonna? An intelligent, talented woman who knows exactly what she wants and knows exactly how to get it. Miranda, don't tell the others. - I won't. - I think we may be able to spin you off into a show of your own. - My own show? - Yes. - But... - But what? But what? But, Josh-- Oh, Josh. Yes. Personally, I mean I think he is fine. - Uh-hmm. - Intense, very intense, maybe too intense. Yeah, he sure is. And you know, I don't really get the feeling he fully supports what you're doing here. What we're all doing here, Miranda. Negativity brings the show down, down, down. Besides you could have anyone you want right now. - Really? - Yes. Why not take this opportunity and explore the possibilities. There's a whole new world waiting for you out there, Miranda. And so, they'll all know your name. - Miranda. - Miranda. - Miranda. - Miranda. The Miranda Webber Show. The Miranda Webber Show. You really drive the girls crazy, Johnny. You should, uh, read some of the letters we've gotten. But I think if you could-- I don't know, open up a bit. Let the audience know what you're feeling. I know your girlfriend just died recently in a car accident, but maybe you could discuss it with your family. It might make you feel better. Fuck you. Or hostility is good, too. You see, Johnny, I just want you to know, that if you ever need to talk, if you ever need anything, well, I'm there for you, 110%, that's me. Because we're in this together, Johnny. Well, because Elise called me the other day. She said her cousin in Florida called and he said that he saw the show-- Why are you doing this? To the Webbers, the stars of the top-rated show on television. And to life's little surprises. What do you mean? I didn't tell you? Oh. Well, the audience love the show as a whole but to our surprise the one single element which received the most positive feedback was conflict. Conflict? They like to watch you fight. They like to watch us fight? Gerald: I don't know. Isn't that crazy. Josh: Okay, that's it. This guy is an asshole. Miranda: Josh, Josh-- I invite you over to my house and you embarrass me in front of everybody. Josh: I don't care, Miranda. This is ridiculous. Horace? Horace, what are you doing? You are right, Dr. Webber. I know now that I must accept myself the real me. Oh, that's wonderful, Horace, but maybe it would be best to start this process of acceptance with your clothes on. Oh, but I must act quickly, I know that now before I lose my courage. Thank you, Dr. Webber. Where is your kitchen? Never mind, I'll find it. You just go on in there-- Emma: Did you have a good time, dear? Oh, yeah, I'm beat. I think I'll just go to bed now and I'll see you both in the morning. Josh called again. Oh. Well, what did you tell him? She told him that we didn't know what your problem was but that we'd try to get you to call him back with some kind of explanation. Oh, I really don't think it matters. I don't plan to see him anymore. Why not? What are you wearing? Mom, Dad, I am going to find the perfect man and I needed a new image to do it with. - What? - Well, what I actually meant was, I am going to make the perfect man. This is Giampaolo. Hello. Giampaolo doesn't speak English very well. So if you don't mind we're going upstairs to my bedroom and I'll explain everything to you in the morning. All right. Just a minute. Now, I think we should talk about this. Goddammit, Miranda! What do think this is, some cheap hotel? I will not allow this kind of behavior in my house. Your house! Your house! This is just as much my house as it is yours! I am not a child and I will not be treated like one. Kindly don't make a scene in front of Giampaolo. Fuck Giampaolo! What about Josh? What about Josh? It's none of your goddamn business! My life and my body are my own. And I will not be told by you or anybody else what I can and cannot do with them. Good night. Good night, Mister-- You goddamn punk! Somebody's gonna get hurt. Do you think you can come into my house and do whatever you want to do with my daughter? Goddamn. Daddy. Daddy. Daddy. Daddy. Daddy. Please, can't we talk about this? Oh, no. No. I'm tired of talking. Who listens to me anyway? Oh, you punk, punk. Punky punk, punk! Punk! Oh, daddy, leave him alone! Get off of him! - Oh, is she gonna get it for that. - Oh, God! Oh, God. Have you gone crazy? Jesus Christ! She really hit me? - Oh. Are you out of your mind? - Miranda, baby. I didn't mean to hurt him. I was just, you know, the cameras. The cameras, honey. But she hurt me. You're all crazy. She hurt me. Emma: Oh. Mike: What's he looking for? I don't know. Maybe a way out. This kid's a fucking nutcase. Do we have any cameras in the attic? No. Uh-huh. No. Poor Giampaolo. Are you all right? I think so. Are you sure? I thought... Giampaolo, all I really need is your face. You see I'm making a sculpture of the perfect man. And you, Giampaolo, you have the perfect face. Me? Yes. Would you help me? What do I do? Well, first you just lie back on the bed and you imagine that you're making love. - What? - You see, I need that look on a man's face right when he's having an orgasm. I need that. This, I cannot do it alone. - Oh, my God. - Oh. Could you try it, Giampaolo? Just lay back on the bed, pretend you're making love with Sophia Loren or Brigitte Bardot. Giampaolo, you're not really trying. No. No, no, no. Try harder. It has to be real. Oh, no, no, no. That's just really lame. Okay. Lie back, close your eyes, don't move. Yes! You've almost got it. I got to get some ice cold water. Cold water? Yes. And a spatula. Don't go anywhere. Where are you going? Making damn sure we have enough tape for this. Hello, Mr. Beautiful Face. I have this stuff for you. Giampaolo: I don't understand. What do you do to me? Miranda: Oh, you know, plaster casting can get really messy and we don't want to make a mess, do we? Okay. This is for the top of your head. - Hmm. - Hmm. You look good in that. This goes here. I love your beautiful face. Wait, wait, wait, wait. How's that? Nice. Now, hold this. What do you do with that? Well, I need to make a plaster casting of your beautiful face. I mix water with this modeling compound and then I stir it all around. And I pour it all over your face. You see, these little straws? Oh, these little straws go right in your nose so you can breathe. And it's very important to be able to breathe because if you don't then you'll be dead. See this, petroleum jelly. The petroleum jelly goes on your eyebrows. And that way, when I take the plaster casting off, it doesn't rip your eyebrows right out of your face. When I pour this plaster on your face, first, it will get really cold, and then it'll get really, really hot. But don't be alarmed, it's just the way the chemicals work. It's nothing to worry about. What if I move my face. Well, you know, something, Giampaolo, it's really good if you move your face except at that particular moment when you achieve orgasm and then you have to hold it really, really still. You know what, oh, maybe, you should do it faster. Miranda: Okay. -Giampaolo: Faster - All right. Here it comes. Are you all right? Oh, oh. Don't try to say anything. Huh? Hmm. That's great. Whoo! Oh. Miranda, Miranda, Miranda, Miranda, Miranda. I can't believe all this mail is for us. It's all your fan mail. And these are your bonuses. Karen? It's just a show of appreciation to the stars of the top-rated show on television. - Gerald. - Thank you. - Oh. - $7,000. Thank you. - You're very welcome. - $25,000. Geez, $42,000? Are these-- are these real? Yes, they're real and they're yours. Oh, my God. Mr. Swade, this man says he wants to tie me up and put his large-- Oh, not to worry. Gerald? - Can we talk? - Absolutely. I have this sensational idea that we should make. Uh-huh. That was all. Man: Lock Up. A new feature on "At Home with the Webbers." Starring Dr. Gerald Webber. So, Mister... I'm sorry. I--I don't quite understand this. Is-- is this your real name? Or just something that your friends call you? Would you prefer that I call you Mr. Hammer or just Sledge? Sledge Hammer. Well, that's an interesting name. Hammer. Hammer, Hammer. That sounds as if it might be German in origin. Quite an unusual name. Your parents have-- your parents had quite a sense of humor. Yes, Mr. Hammer. Please feel free to say anything. Just-- just say anything at all. My mother wore red once. I hate red. These poor people. What poor people? They all want advice. What should I say? Tell them to join the club. Tell them to seek therapy. Emma: I can't tell them that. Some of them sound like they have real problems. As opposed to? You know, therapy problems. Honey. Yeah. What are you doing? I need space. But you're in a corner. I know I'm in the corner. Do you think I don't know I'm in the corner? A corner is a space. This corner is my space. Oh. Oh. Billy: He hardly leaves his room anymore. I'm gonna go for a walk. I'll be back. Okay. - Come on, Chuck. - You live here? It's amazing. Oh. Hoo. This is huge. Uh-oh. I'm sorry. Chucky, Chucky, Chucky. You know, you're not very graceful for a dancer. I know. But something magic happens when I put on a G-string. I know. You drove those women crazy. You've got the best legs in the whole world. I know. Miranda: I was wondering what you would look like if you just had these leather thingies on. I don't know. Would you like to find out? Yeah. Hey. What's happening? Damn tape that keeps dragging. I'm gonna check it out. - You okay? - Yeah, I'm okay. I'mma go up and check #12. It's been a little shaky. Okay. See you. All right. All right. You're dead, cowboy. Chucky, I was wondering if you could do a little somethin' for me later on. I'll do something for you now and later. I'll do something to you that they'll whisper about for years to come. I'll-- Shh, shh, shh, shh! Chucky, you're fucking up my moment. I was hoping in the front too. Those cowboys really knew what they were doing. So rugged, so practical, so hard. I like that in a man. We're moving out of the light. Don't you worry about a thing, Chucky baby. I always think it's really important to leave just a little bit to the imagination. Johnny? Johnny, it's Billy. I don't know if you remember me but-- You're one of the elves. Elves? Oh, yeah. Right. Aren't you afraid they'll see you come up? No, it's okay. I turned off the camera in your room and we're safe here. I saw you on the monitor. Are you okay? You know exactly how I am. You see everything, don't you? Is this just another job to you? I didn't know it was gonna be like this. And neither did I. Don't you think it's time you let her go? Oh my God. Mike, you bastard. Johnny, I'm sorry. Oh, no. Oh, stop it. Chuck, stop it. Now I really can't move. Chuck, it's time for the favor. I didn't do it, Johnny. I swear, I didn't even know. I believe you. I thought if I could just get you to talk to your parents again, you know? I can't talk to them. They're all wrapped up in themselves and this TV thing and they don't give a shit about me. Maybe you should give them another chance. What does it matter? If you let yourself love someone they're just gonna leave you anyway. Johnny, Janet didn't leave you. She died. What's the difference? I mean, she's not here and I am. Sometimes I try to think of her. I can't even make out her face. It's, like, I'm forgetting, like, it all never really happened. It's like I never loved her. I mean, do you think they care about that? I mean, they're all trying to be something they're not for the cameras and I'm trying to hold on to what's left of me. I am so sick of feeling sorry for myself, all alone in this goddamn fish bowl, thinking about dying. How can you stand being in the same room with me? I don't know. I kind of like it. Johnny, hey. You're not alone. Then help me, please? Reporter: Excuse me, ladies. What do you think of Johnny Webber? Oh, my god, I cried my eyes out. If I was his girlfriend, I would never die. That was so sad. Billy should have kissed him or something. I know exactly how Johnny feels. - I mean it's obvious. - Exactly. - He needs affection. - Right. Reporter: Excuse me. What do you think of Johnny Webber? Not much. About the teen idol guy. Nah, There's only one idol. That was Elvis. The rest of these guys, a bunch of posers, geeks mostly. Reporter: Excuse me, sir. What do you think of the Webbers? Johnny? Gerald? Emma? Miranda? Oh, Miranda. Oh. I know exactly where she's at. I mean, my god, there is a serious shortage of perfect men. Believe me, honey, I have looked. Once she gets that perfect man finished, I want one. Make that two because if he's perfect he won't be jealous. Oh, you-- this is the '90s, Diana. - I know that, sweetheart. - And you cannot just go, go around sleeping with every man. I want to have a hot, sweaty, sleazy sex. - All good. All good. - Honey, you are seriously uptight. Would you listen to me? If I'm gonna die, I'm gonna die happy. You're just uptight. They don't need uptight out-of-love. - When's the last time you got laid? - I am not. Honey, I know what you need, and that perfect man is just the one to give it to her. I am not uptight. I am not uptight. You got an answer? Emma and I are very much alike. Thank you. Well, then why isn't she answering my letters? Well, I'm sure she gets a lot of mail. What'd she say? "Dear, Mrs. Nelson. I know exactly how you feel. My husband and I have been married for 27 years now, and the passion, well, let's just say, that passion is not my general strongest suit." Don't we know it? "My advice to you would be to do whatever makes you feel good about yourself, because although it's trying to be told day after day in many subtle ways that you are unattractive, it is unbearable to believe it. Warmest regards, Emma Webber." Oh, I'm sorry, I feel awful bothering you at home like this but I wrote weeks ago, and I just don't know what to do. Oh, I feel stupid. I'm sorry, I get a lot of letters. Would you like to come in? My husband's having an affair with a man half my age. And my son and daughter, oh, they moved to Utah and got married to each other. And I think-- I think that I may be... a lesbian. What should I do? Shoot yourself, honey. Emma: Have you tried talking it over with a therapist? My husband's a therapist. Oh, really? So is mine. I know. Well, your husband's situation and your children's is really out of your hands. Oh. They're certainly not your fault. - My daughter-- - Miranda. - A little nympho. - Seems to be going through some sort of stage. Oh. Maybe she's just a slut. There. Emma: I don't think so. But we're here to talk about you. Let's talk about what you're feeling? Hello. I'm sorry, I scared you. I'm sorry. I don't think Miranda is home right now. She might be down in the basement. I'm not here for Miranda. I'm here for you. I mean, your pipes. I've already shut off the water. It should only take a minute. Oh, I just assumed my daughter Miranda is making this-- never mind. Well, I will tell you, I'm far from perfect. Besides, she's not my type. Oh, I'll just be quiet and move out of your way. You're blushing. We don't see that too often. It looks good on you. And I love the hair. I think I'll-- I'll just go upstairs and-- oh, I don't know, find something to do. Good morning, guys. - Good morning. - Hey. What the hell is that noise? The kid. He's been singing that same freaking song for the past couple hours. It wouldn't be so bad if he knew more than the first two lines. ♪ Until we meet again ♪ Aloha 'Oe, Aloha 'Oe ♪ Farewell to thee, farewell to me ♪ ♪ Farewell until we meet again ♪ I want sex. And I want it now. Gerald: Aah! Oh, my god. We was poor. My ma, she'd hang this sheet across the room whenever she had guys come over. It was all flowered. Lots of bright colors. I would act like I was sleepin' 'cause I knew she didn't want me to know. But I heard. I heard everything. I just stare at that sheet and I heard everything. Sometimes I'd hear her laugh. But most of the time I just heard them. The guy's making noises like they wanted me to hear. Like they wanted me to know what they was doing to my ma. I'd stare at that sheet. I swear. It'd start to glow. It was colors. - Man: Hey. - Jumping out at me. What are you doing here? - Woman: What are you doing in here? - Burning into my brain. Making me wanna to jump up and beat the shit out of them. Man: Stop it! It was the baseball bat. Let them know that I heard, all right? Woman: What did you do? No. - Make them know. - What did you do? That I knew what they did to my mom. Gerald: Was there red in that sheet? Yeah. There was red, lots of red. Gerald: So how did you deal with that? How did you deal with that red? I knew how it works. How what works? I only eat stuff that's green. I don't understand. If I eat green, it cancels out the red. Okay, get back! Go ahead! I'll splat his brains all over the place. Mike: We got to call the cops, Mr. Swade. Not yet. Let's wait and see what happens. - Sledge: Get back! - We should do something. Roger: We are doing something by choosing to do nothing. - I don't understand. - Karen, its not our job to alter history. Simply to record it. - He says to wait. - What? Give me the phone. That mutt gets near me, I'll crush the doc's skull. Johnny: What's going on here? Is this real? Oh, Johnny, please. Sledge: Oh, the cops. They're coming, they're coming. Good. Good. Sledge is gonna kill Gerald. - Uh-oh. - What? Emma: Mister... - Hammer. - Mr. Hammer, I don't know what's gotten you so upset but I'm sure if you let my husband go we can discuss it. Oh, Emma, please be quiet. Hey, doc, - you got a real hot looking lady. - Thank you. Okay. Oh, I think the session's over. - Five bucks, Gerald gets it. - You're on. Policeman: All right, Hammer. Let the doctor go and we'll talk. Suck my dick, blue boy! I'm sorry, ma'am. I understand. You're under a lot of pressure. I mean, I like the doc and all. I love the doc. But I feel my potential is being underutilized. Emma: How so? Well, my buddies, they say that I deserve more screen time. - Screen time? - Well, you know, he's got these wackos on the show and I know they got problems and all, but-- You feel that you've been slighted? I don't want my own show or nothing. I just want a little more time with the doc. To work out your problems? Yeah, right. And more close-ups. Emma: Well, Mr. Hammer, I think that can be arranged. Don't you, sweetheart? Sounds reasonable to me. Mr. Hammer. Call me Sledge. Pay up, pay up, pay up, pay up. That woman, there is nothing she can't do. Gerald: The first thing that comes into your mind. The grass on my momma's grave. Buttercups on my momma's grave. My momma's face... when I choked the shit out of her. Come on. All right. It was more like purple. ♪ Gone are your kisses ♪ Gone is your touch ♪ I never thought that ♪ I would miss you so much ♪ ♪ But my public's calling ♪ And I live for my art ♪ And that is why ♪ We're apart, sweetheart ♪ It's hard to be a star ♪ No matter where you are ♪ Their eyes are all on you ♪ At times it seems unfair ♪ A cross that's hard to bear ♪ ♪ But what else can I do? - ♪ We love her - ♪ They love me - ♪ We need her - ♪ They need me ♪ I know that they will never leave me ♪ ♪ Their lives are... ♪ Our lives are... ♪ ...so empty - ♪ ...so empty - Huh?

Those are your fans. We've been able to hold them off up until now, but... it's getting tougher and tougher. They're really hooked. You could just go out there. Tell them all to go away. Throw rocks, scream and yell. It's your house, you know. And you'd love that, wouldn't you? What happens when this thing is all over and all we are is people again? But by then, we wouldn't know how to be anything but assholes like you. Johnny, Johnny, Johnny. Primetime is just a fleeting moment in the sun. Reruns are forever. Oh, my god. Miranda. Oh, sorry. I'm just wondering, do you have one of those-- those colored things, you know, to-- you mix colors. A color wheel? I guess so. Yeah. Here it is. This looks good. Thank you. I never thought that things would change like this between all of us. I thought it would, well, be good for the family. I thought it would hold us together. Well, it is. It does, right? Yeah. Oh, sure, I guess so. You don't-- you don't need this? No. I'll let you know if I do. Okay. I mean, just let me know if you do. Dad. Yes, son? What are you doing? I've discovered the key to mental health. That's nice, dear. No, really. I have. No more mental anguish. No more childhood traumas. No more sexual hang-ups. Miranda: Oh, what is it? Colors. Colors. What-- what kind of colors? Well, it's not so much the color as the combination of colors. You see, I'm wearing nothing but red today. So, I'm eating nothing but green. The opposite color in the spectrum. So? Oh, well, so, by wearing the one color and eating the opposite color, the two colors cancel each other out, creating a neutral and harmonious emotional state. I am absolutely neutral. How about it, Em? I'm feeling neutral tonight. Thomas: Hey, those your parents? Miranda: Stay close, it's a big house. Wouldn't want you to get lost. I haven't seen Josh around lately. - He's a good guy. - Oh. What's she doing with this guy? He looks like a nice guy. That's what I said. What's she doing with this guy? You know, we went to the same high school together. Yeah, I know. He told me your nickname. Oh. Look, Miranda. I don't think Josh would really appreciate-- Huh? What's this? Choo choo trains. My mother gave them to me for Christmas. Well, that's really cute. That's a joke. Oh. Oh. Oh, what have we here? Me? All of it? Okay. All right. Oh, my god. Give me a towel, quick. Wow. "Dear Johnny, I just want you to know that my friends think you're totally hot. I'm the president of your official fan club here in Bakersfield. So, if you want to talk or anything, here's my number. Love, Jojo and the Bakersfield branch of the Johnnettes." Sorry. It's been a long time. So, what was that favor you wanted to ask me? She can't do that, can she? Why didn't you tell me about this before? Well, I thought if we had sex first, then maybe you'd feel more relaxed about the whole thing. I'm relaxed, all right. It's relaxed too. Real relaxed. Wait a minute. I have an idea. It just might work. I read about something in a Chinese sex manual once. What, if we dress it up, it'll feel more confident? Got it. Jesus. That's cold. Sorry. I think that's how it's supposed to go on. Ooh, it's great. You got a bracelet to match. One particular Chinese emperor was so obsessed with sex, he'd make love to four or five women a day. This is how he did it. It traps the blood and it keeps it hard. - For how long? - I don't know. Until you take it off, I guess. It's not working. No. It sure isn't. - Maybe it goes back. - Ow, ow, ow! - Miranda: Sorry, sorry. - All right. Take it off. It's-- it's-- - It's too tight now. - Well, I think it's supposed to be tight. - Hey. - Hey. "Dear Johnny, if you're so goddamn miserable, why don't you just kill yourself and put us all out of our misery. Be a man." It may burn a little in the last stages. Great, something to look forward to. Miranda. Uh-hmm? Your last name, it's Webster, right? Uh-hmm, Webber. Webber? Uh-huh. "At Home with the Webbers'" Webber? Miranda: That's us. Oh, Jesus. Oh, it's burning. Get it off me. Let me outta here. Oh, hold still. You'll wreck the mold. Oh, my God, Miranda Webber. Ow! It came out great. Wonderful. Now, get this ring thing off me, it hurts. Miranda: Oh, don't be such a baby. I'll get it off for you. Ow! God, that is still connected to my body, you know? Oh, yeah. Yeah, real funny. Sorry. Uh-oh. I don't wanna hear, "Uh-oh." It really is stuck. Uh-oh. Daddy, have you got a hacksaw? Thomas! Thomas! Thomas! Look what I found. Oh, no way. You're gonna kill me with that thing. That should have been my line. Oh, uh-uh. Look, Thomas, do you want to walk around like that the rest of your life? Maybe I could get work as a tour guide. Look, it's either this or we'll have to call the paramedics. Okay. It's all right. Now, you just lie down on the bed and don't panic. Don't act like such a baby. It won't hurt at all. One, two, three. Miranda, can I ask you something? Anything, darling, as long as it's terribly personal. Your sculpture, is it your perfect man or just what everybody thinks the perfect man should be? Oh. I-- I don't know. I don't know. I guess, I just do it. Well, anyway, it was really nice meeting you. I always thought Josh was exaggerating. Yeah. Well, the star of every locker room. Let's just say you're a nice place to visit. Yeah, I know. Bye. - Bye. - Oh, wait a minute! I just had a really great idea. Why don't you come to the unveiling, Thomas? You and all the others. All my perfect men all around me. The audience will eat it up. It will be like an old Broadway musical. I mean, I have to take a pass on that, Miranda. I don't like being stared at. You know what else? I don't think I'd particularly like to be thought of as your anything. Woman: Over here, Johnny. Woman #2: Johnny! Johnny, come here! Come here! - Billy! Billy! - The kid looks like he's in bad shape. - I don't know what to do. - Help me. Yeah. Yeah. I sent her out for doughnuts and she's got the goddamn PD door. - Billy, help me! - He keeps screaming her name. - Help me! - All right. All right. All right, Mr. Swade, I won't. Hey, Mike, I got your doughnuts. All right. Thanks. What the hell is going on? Mike: Oh, no. Jesus Christ. Careful. Careful. Jesus Christ. Johnny. Come on, Johnny. Come on, Johnny, breathe. Come on. Breathe. Mr. Swade made me promise not to call the cops. - Breathe, goddammit. - He said the kid was only bluffing. Breathe! Come on! Nothing. Did you hear that, Swade? Did you hear that? He's dead! You killed him, goddammit! Get away from him! Just get away. Man: Unto almighty God, We commend the soul of our brother departed, Jonathan Harris Webber. And we commit his body to the ground; earth to earth, ashes to ashes, dust to dust, in sure and certain hope of resurrection unto eternal life, through our Lord Jesus Christ, at whose coming in glorious majesty to judge the world, the earth and the sea shall give up their dead. And the corruptible bodies of those who sleep in him shall be changed and made life unto his own glorious body according to the mighty working whereby he is able to subdue all things unto himself. Oh, Johnny. Who's minding the store downstairs? - Two temps. - Temps? This is a live broadcast. What the hell are you trying to do to me? I checked them out, they're good. What's with her? Mike says she feels responsible. The kid asked for her help a while back. She hasn't let anyone else near him, took total charge of the arrangements. What kind of help did he want? I don't know. Goddamn brat. We won't last long without him. How about the others? Miranda's still drawing a good share. There are only 101 different positions. That goddamn statue of hers better walk, talk, tap dance, and sing "The Star" fucking "Spangled Banner." Fuck it, the blue metal stars. Hmm. I'm so sorry. Reporter: Excuse me, Miss, what do you think of the Webbers? Oh, I thought it was sad they killed off the boy but I could have guessed it was coming. Oh, well, he'll show up again next fall. They always find a way to bring the good characters back. Reporter: No, no. You don't understand, Miss. The Webbers, they're real. Johnny really did die. You can't fool me. I know real. This Webber show, it's not real. Real families don't act like that. They just don't. Hello? Hello? Hey, Mike. Hey, Steve, what's happening? What are you doing here, man? Billy quit. She asked me to cover. You know, until they find someone permanent. She quit? Man, Get out of here. She loves these crackpots. Oh, she asked me to give you this. Oh, fuck it. She was a tight ass, you know what. It'll be kind of cool to have a guy around here. Do you know any dirty jokes? Mike, I guess you haven't heard, I found the Lord. Where did you find him, man? Was he lost? Mike, I have a feeling the Lord brought us together for a reason. Okay. Jesus died for your sins. - Okay. - Until you accept the second coming of your Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, there'll be no place in heaven to save your mortal soul. Josh. - Huh? - Give me a hand. What? Come on. What are you painting, Dr. G? Everything. The whole damn world needs a new coat of paint. - Let's start right here. - This? Take this off. Come on. Come on. Roger, baby. You're just in time. I'm about to unveil the perfect man. - Hi. - Hi. All right, everybody. Stand over there. I want you all to get the full effect. Excuse me, I have something to say. Excuse me, can't it wait? No, I'm afraid it can't. Look, Roger. I think you're forgetting just who the stars are in this thing. He said cut it. All right. All right. He said cut it. Fuck it. See what this guy's says for himself. My fans have been waiting a long time for this moment and I, Miranda Webber, am going to give it to them. Ta-da. Well? Well? Well? Gerald: Maybe it could be a coat rack. Emma: For short people. - Well, it's very-- - Big. Goddamnit! Is that all you people have to say? This is my masterpiece, you fucking weasels! Get away from me! Don't you dare touch me! This is my moment! It's mine! Go upstairs. The only thing down here is the couch. Huh? They're taking our furniture? - Your family has been cancelled. - What? Roger: The viewers no longer perceive your family as real. They don't believe that real people would actually behave the way that you have. Miranda: What's-- what's this? Roger: It's your final compensation. I don't want your money. I want my spin-off! You said I could have a spin-off! You promised! You said "The Miranda Webber Show," you said. That's showbiz. Or maybe they could do something with my statue. Maybe they could put it in a museum or something. Your statue was produced on the show, for the show, and by the show, therefore the network owns it. And if you are lucky, your statue will wind up as a fountain in some executive's driveway. Well, then. No need to get sentimental. It was fun. Ciao. Why don't you fuck off. - Come on. - Come on, Miranda. - I don't understand. - Stars. There are 45 camera plates built into the interior walls of the house, but only 20 of them actually have cameras behind them. Man: Excuse me, Ms. James. Karen, please. Ms. Karen, how do we know which one of these to talk into? Oh, we don't want you to talk into the cameras. We just want you to be yourselves. We don't want acting. We want real life. Oh, wow. - Roger: Oh. -Uh-huh. Oh, man. What are you looking at? Poor darling. - It's been fun. - Roger: What are you doing? -Woman: Put your hands in. -Man: Hey, who's he? Nobody to worry about. - Woman: Is he hurt? - Man: Looks kinda funny. Karen: That's just his face. I apologize for the mess. We'll have it all cleaned up. Did I tell you about our technical staff? We'll have two technicians working with you downstairs. They'll monitor the cameras, the lighting equipment. Yes! You're okay. - Of course, I'm okay. - You are okay. Yeah, it's really too bad, though. Thank you. Because I think I was on to something. What do you think? I think the idea of blue food is too much for me. Yeah. Emma had a problem with that, too. Come on, Miranda. Let's go. Johnny! You promised to stay dead until I got my spin-off. You're such a liar. Jerk. I can't believe it. - Come on, boy. - Good job. Come here. Come here. Come here. Come on, Alfred. - What? - It looks like oil or something. - Well, can anything be done? - I don't know. - It's not-- - It looks like it overheated, right? - All right, let's go. - Needs oil. - Oil. - Let's leave it. - Leave it? - Come on. - Just leave it? - Emma: We got plenty of money. - Come on. - Billy: We're just gonna leave it here? - Well, you know - Come on. $600,000, you can do a lot with $600,000. - Billy: Oh, yeah, you could. - Miranda: I want my-- - Emma: We need a new car. - Miranda: I want my-- - Gerald: Yeah. - We need a new place to live in. Miranda: I want my spin-off. Gerald: And I think we're gonna have to find a new name. Josh: Miranda, sweetheart? - What? - Shut up. Oh my God. I knew you weren't dead. I just knew it. Can I have your autograph? I can't. I'm sorry. Oh, okay. Here. - Thanks. - Sure. - Bye. - Woman: Bye. ♪ Ooh, ooh, ooh ♪ Yeah, yeah, oh, yeah, yeah ♪ ♪ I'm gonna see my name ♪ Shining high above the night ♪ ♪ Radiate a million lights♪ ♪ And I want to see my face ♪ ♪ On the cover of a magazine♪ ♪ Looking through a TV screen ♪ ♪ And I wanna hear my voice ♪ ♪ With a hypnotizing flow ♪ Speaking through the radio ♪ And I wanna see myself ♪ Livin' high and feeling proud ♪ ♪ I got my head above the clouds ♪ ♪ If I could be anything for a day ♪ ♪ I'd be king for a day ♪ Can you hear it? ♪ If I could be anything for a day ♪ ♪ I'd be king for a day ♪ Fifteen minutes ♪ I was wrong ♪ I never meant to have you ♪ ♪ No, no, no, no, no ♪ Give me one more chance ♪ Oh, ooh ♪ Yeah, yeah ♪ If I could be anything for a day ♪ ♪ I'd be king for a day ♪ Can you hear it? ♪ If I could be anything for a day ♪ ♪ I'd be king for a day ♪ Fifteen minutes ♪ Oh, can you hear it? ♪ Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah ♪ If I could be anything for a day ♪ ♪ I'd be king for a day ♪ Can you hear it? ♪ If I could be anything for a day ♪ ♪ I'd be king for a day ♪ If I could be anything for a day ♪ ♪ I'd be king for a day ♪ Can you hear it? ♪ Ooh, hooh ♪ Hoh, oh, yeah
