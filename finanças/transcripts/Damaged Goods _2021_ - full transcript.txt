When are you gonna fix my sink Bob? When are you gonna pay your rent? Amanda. I don't have time for this Richie, I'm late. Yeah, tell me about, I've been out here waiting for you. Okay. What part of we're through don't you get? Oh, come on Amanda, don't be like that. No, don't touch me. Amanda, it's just, I miss you a lot. Well, you should've thought about that before you stole the money from my fridge. So you're breaking up with me because I borrowed some money from you? Borrow? You didn't borrow money Richie, you stole my vintage jar, my money. 10 Months worth of tips, you stole it and you bought a guitar. Hey, that guitar was a steal. I had to act fast. I mean, would you have given me the money if I'd asked you? - No. - Yeah, see. Besides, who keeps their money in a fridge. You ever heard of a bank? I don't trust banks. Right, yeah. You don't trust banks. You don't trust boyfriends. I wonder if you even trust yourself enough to love anybody. Look, I'm gonna pay you back, I promise. The band is starting to book some gigs, so I'll just need to come by your place later and you know, pick up the guitar. Don't bother, I'm selling it. What? No, you can't do that. Sure I can, I paid for it. Okay. Okay, I get it. I'm sorry. I should have asked you first and I didn't and now you're mad at me, but you can't sell that guitar. It's classic. No, this is classic Richie. I'm not doing it anymore. I'll give you a month, one month to buy back the guitar and then you can keep it. - A month? - Yeah. Where am I gonna find that kind of money in a month? I don't know. You ever heard of a bank? Well, well, well, look who decided to show up today. I know, I'm sorry. - Mh - hm. Would you at least like to hear my excuse? Oh, I heard it. You heard that? - Mh - hm. But please, I don't need any details unless you're abducted by aliens. Were you abducted by aliens? No. Lucky aliens, but really though, this late thing is getting to be a habit. Keep it up and I'll be forced to fire you. All right. But you'd still be my friend right? Oh sure, I'm not getting fired. All right. Hold down the Fort, please. I need you to run this to the bank. Where's Justin? On a bakery run. You know when he does that, he takes a couple of muffins for himself, right? Well yeah, but I'll sacrifice a muffin or two for an employee that shows up on time. Besides, I deduct the cost from his tips, he hasn't figured it out. Okay Mands, the refills are done. I'll try to contain my excitement. Stop calling me Mands. Fine. Amanda, I'm out of here. I'll see you tomorrow. Yep, I'm counting the hours. Don't even think about it Justin. Excuse me. What can I get for you? Are you Amanda James? Who wants to know? My name is Lily Stevenson. I was wondering if you had a minute. Unless you're selling tin mints, I'm not interested. Okay, then I will have a cafe latte with skimmed milk. Is there a place we can talk? It's about your father. I don't know where he is. Last I heard, he was living somewhere upstate. I know, that's not why I'm here, Amanda, your father's dying. So what? You're here from some law firm trying to settle his estate? I don't want it, give it to Goodwill. How'd you find me here anyway? The cafe's web page. I hate the internet. - I'm not from a law firm. - Hank and I are friends. You and my father are friends? Yeah. Actually, if it weren't for Hank, I would be dead right now. I was an addict and he got me into AA and just stood by me through two relapses until I eventually got sober. He never gave up on me. Lucky you. He helped save my life. Okay. Well, what do you want? Your liver, just a part of it. - What are you? - The walking dead. Amanda, your father has a liver disease and his only chance is to have a transplant. Look, I don't know how it is where you're from, but around here asking a complete stranger for their internal organs might be construed as, I don't know, creepy. I know it's terrible to dump all this on you like this, but I'm desperate. He's on the transplant list and he's running out of time. And you think since I'm his daughter, that I'd be a donor match? He didn't have the guts to ask me himself, did he? He sent you. He didn't want you involved. He would be really upset with me if he knew I was doing this. Look, I won't even pretend to understand what caused the rift between the two of you. Rift? God, that's such an interesting way of putting it. I don't want to be rude, but we're closing. Yeah. All right. I'm sorry for wasting your time. Hey girl scout, 4.75 for the latte. Of course. Here you go. There you go. FYI, I never said I wouldn't do it. What? I didn't say I wouldn't get tested. Then you will? I didn't say that either. Okay, look, here's the doctor's number and if you do decide to do it, then just give them a call and they'll set it all up and thank you for considering it. Thanks. Hey stranger. Scotch rocks? Am I that predictable? What are you waiting for? Pour. Haven't seen you in here for a while. The prices you charge, I'm surprised I can be in here at all. Well, you still get me to pour your drink. I guess it's okay. Everything okay? Yeah, why? Well, for starters, you're staring at a card from a surgeon. You tend bars long enough and you get pretty good at reading stuff upside down. It's not for me. It's my dad. He needs a liver transplant and they want to see if I'm a match, so. Sorry about your dad. But if you're a match, at least you're giving him a second chance at life right? Good point. To second chances. Second chances. After the procedure, the portion of the liver that we remove will automatically regenerate. You do this kind of thing all the time? Not exactly. You see, most of the patients that we diagnose with collegial carcinoma are over the age of 50. So finding a viable donor in time is next to impossible. To be completely honest with you. Most people die before a donor can be found. Oh. However, having a family member as a potential candidate does increase the odds dramatically. So how does this kind of thing work? Well first, we'll do a test to make sure that your liver is healthy enough to operate. You annotated here on your history, a high level of alcohol consumption. You say high, I say normal. Well, according to the AMA, your normal is our high, but a biopsy will tell us for sure. Biopsy? Great. It's just a simple outpatient procedure. It does require a needle though. After that, it's just a matter of some blood tests to screen for viruses, a routine physical and a psych evaluation. A psych evaluation? - Yes. - It's just protocol. Just to make sure that the candidate doesn't feel pressured into donating. People do that? Desperate people will do almost anything. Well, you better get back to work. Absolutely. I'm gonna have Tina out front schedule your tests and make sure that everything goes well for your biopsy. In the meantime, follow those instructions for me. Go easy on the sauce. Got it. Should have your results in about a week or so. And if it turns out I'm not a match. Then most likely your father doesn't finish out the year. Justin, Justin, Justin. Do you mind? I'm trying to study. I don't get you. Why'd you go back to school if you don't have to? Because I want to do something with my life besides this. Yeah but Law school. Well, what are you gonna do with that? What do you think? I'm gonna make cheesy commercials, sue people and buy Alexis. That's cool. I guess. What about you, Amanda? You're gonna fly off to Venice and start a new life? I'll let you know when I get there. If I ever get there. Hey Mands. Ever since you dumped Richie, he's been super bummed out. I've never seen him this low. Save it for somebody who cares, Justin. I'm telling you, Richie's just moping around with that sad puppy dog look of his. - Well. - You know. No, no, I don't know. Oh, well it's kind of like this. - That's not a sad puppy. - That's a constipated one. What do you know. I know what a constipated dog looks like. And I know that guys like Richie never change. No man, you're wrong. He's getting his act together. Sure. And maybe I'm wrong about my ex-husband too. Any minute now he could walk through that door with five years worth of back child support and tell me that he actually wants to spend time with his daughter. I could be wrong, but I'm not. I got your test results, you're a match. Are you sure? Positive. Amanda, are you still there? Yeah, I'm here. Okay. Now I just need you both to sign consent forms. Then we can schedule the surgery. Your father's available tomorrow at two. Will that work for you? I'll make it work. Great, I'll let your father know we're on for tomorrow. Okay, thank you. Hey, I need you out front. Yeah, I'm coming. I need to take off a little early tomorrow. I have a doctor's appointment. Again? That's like the third one in two weeks. Are you sick? No, I'm fine, I just need to take off early. Is that cool? No, no, it's not unless you tell me why. I just did. Look, the only reason you still have a job here is because we're friends. I put up with a lot from you and you know it. So if you want a favor, I need a reason. Fine. It's my dad. He needs a liver transplant. I've been doing tests to see if I'm a match it turns out I am, so lucky me. A liver transplant? Girl, if you're just gonna make up an excuse. You should definitely go with something more plausible. Are you serious? I'm so sorry. I had no idea. Well, is this why you needed time off? Why didn't you just tell me? I've known you for years. You've never even mentioned your family. I don't know, like this transplant thing. I can finally have a second chance to put some things behind me, move forward. Got to make the best of it I guess. You totally stole that from a Hallmark movie. But I got to do it. Call me and let me know how it goes, okay. Love you guys. I'm listening to you at home. Amanda, there you are. Sorry I'm late. Everything okay? Yeah, I'm good. Alright. This is pastor Clairemont Miller. She's gonna be joining us today. Hi, it's nice to meet you. Please call me Claire. St. Francis has pastors on call when requested. I didn't ask for one. No, you're right, but your father did. I've been counseling Hank since he's been in town for the procedure. Claire will also serve as our official witness. Okay. Shall we? All right. It's so good to see you again. Thank you. You knew about this? Yeah. You shouldn't have done this. Hey dad. Surprised to see me? Yeah. I hear pastor Claire's been counseling you. Yes. We've had some wonderful conversations over coffee. The man knows his scripture. Yeah, it's funny. He used to say that... What was it? The Bible was only made for frightened superstitious people. Was that it dad? I bet you must be pretty frightened right now. I think we're getting off on the wrong foot here. Yes, don't worry, it's just nerves I think. Any questions about the consent forms? So, Lily tells me that you are sober now. Yes, I am. - That's so interesting. - And that you found God. And in ways we still don't understand. He seems to have given Hank a second chance. I just told my friend the exact same thing yesterday. I think this is my second chance. I don't understand. Do you want to tell her dad or should I? All these years and you're still a coward. Please stop. Why? You didn't. It's funny, you used to have a power over me and then some like cosmic shift happened and now I have the power over you. I think we need to take a step back. This is starting to get ugly. Ugly? Ugly. You don't know the half of it Lily tells me you two are close friends. How close is close would you say? Did he tell you that when I was eight after my mom had passed and then I got the courage to finally run away from home when I was 17, that he would come home drunk. He would pull my nightgown up around my neck, pull my underwear down and force himself inside of me. Then all the while telling me how much of a good little girl I am. And this is what good little girls do to please their daddies. Did he tell you that? Did you tell her that dad? No. He brushed over that part. Amanda, you seem upset, why don't we... Go outside, get some fresh air? I'm good. Thank you. So now you think that all these years later, I'm just gonna come in here and save you? Look at me. This is what your good little girl looks like. She's not gonna save you. Call me for the funeral. You want to attend? No. There's a nice bottle of scotch I've been saving it for. Amanda. Nope, whatever cliche Bible verse you're gonna spit out at me right now, just don't. Amanda, wait. Didn't we just do this? You have every right to be hurt and angry, but this is no way to fix it. What makes you think I need to be fixed? He deserves to die. And I promise you when his time comes, he will be held accountable. Accountable. What is it with you church people? You know that man have been counseling is a liar, right? So if you want to believe that little crap, then be my guest. You're right. All I can do is take it on faith that he's truly a changed man. Do you have kids Claire? - I do. - Do me a favor. Next time you go on vacation, leave your girls with my father and see how that works out for you since you have so much faith in him and all. My faith is in God. Where was God when I needed Him to save me from my own father, huh? What does that say about me? That none of this matters, that I don't matter? Come on, pastor. You're supposed to have all the answers. That's what I thought. Keep your God. I don't need Him. You might want to slow down a little bit. I'm celebrating. What's the occasion? Second chances. Oh, you mean that thing with your father? That's great. Good for you. Yeah, good for me. You know, the world would be a whole lot better off if more people were like you. A friend coming down here to celebrate with you? No, just me. You're late. Yeah, I know, I'm sorry. Hey, how'd it go? I tried calling last night. Have you seen your dad? He's fine. What can I get for you? Hey, when's your dad's surgery? I need to schedule a cover for you. Man, I wish someone needed my liver. That'd be sick. You told him? I'm sorry, I didn't realize it was a secret. I wouldn't have told you if you hadn't forced me to. Chill Mands, you're gonna be a hero. I can see it now. Daughters saves father's life. Shut up, Justin. Don't you have something you can do in the kitchen? No. Well, can you find something please? I'm just trying to be supportive. Okay, go support stacking inventory. Okay, okay, geez. - I'm sorry, okay. - I didn't know. So what are the dates that you need off? Don't worry about it. Well, it's my job to worry about it. So do you need the time off or not? Not. Look, since I didn't ask for your opinion, then I don't have to give you an excuse. Is everything all right? Everything's fine. People need to stay out of my business. Well, you sort of involve me in your business when you bring your business into my business. So what happened? Can you just leave it? No I can't, I care about you. I never asked you to. Wow. I've got to give you points for perseverance. You really don't know how to take no for an answer, do you? You can have a career in sales, telemarketing. You could sell timeshares in Florida. Funny, snippy but funny. If you're here to ask me to reconsider, you're wasting your time. I'm not changing my mind. That's not why I'm here. I'm not too concerned with whether Hank gets a transplant or not. I mean, we're all gonna die of something, right? I take it back, you're a terrible salesman. I would not buy timeshares from you. Where did you get your pastor's license? A box of cracker jacks? You got something against cracker jacks? No. Okay, well, if you're not asking me to reconsider, then why are you here? Something you said the other day struck a nerve with me. For a long time, I felt like I was damaged goods. Sometimes I still feel like that I am. What happened? Did your boyfriend break up with you on prom night? I killed my little sister. I was 16, the ink was still wet on my driver's license. Julie needed paint for a school project and I begged my parents to let me drive her to the craft store. I was fiddling with the radio and never saw the light in the intersection turn red. Julie was killed instantly, me, not a scratch on the outside. It shattered my parents and they split up a year later. That was my fault. It was my fault and I hated myself for it. I was in a dark place for a long time. I'm sorry. Is this the part where you found God and you changed? I'm just trying to keep up. I'm just saying your past does not have to define who you can become. Praise the Lord, Hallelujah. What is that? Quote number 37 from the Christian book of cliches. I don't, I don't care. I'm sorry about your sister, I really am. But you don't know me. You don't know what I'm going through. What I'm still going through. You want to know why I ran away when I was 17? I was pregnant with his. I had a miscarriage and it was bad and now I can't have children. That man is a monster. What kind of God forgives somebody like him? I'm so sorry. Look, I know you're here because you want to help me, but do me a favor, go home to your kids. They need you, I don't. Amanda. What are you doing here? Oh, duh. I guess it was too much to hope that maybe you came to say you wanted to get back together. I'm gonna need to see your ID. Seriously? Yeah, Policy. - Would you look at that. - Me giving you more money. You know, I got this job so that I could buy back the guitar. Listen, I just want to say that you know that I'm not mad at you anymore. I was, you know, mad I thought you and I kind of had something there, you know? I mean, up until you went all ballistic on me, that was messed up. That's me, messed up. But I'm not wrong, am I? There were moments when things were okay between us, right? Yeah, I guess. Usually when we were both drunk. Wow, that didn't say much for us, does it? Guess I should say thanks. Why? When you broke up with me, I don't feel like drinking so much anymore. I'm a whole lot more focused on the band. So I guess that's progress, right? It would be easier to get rid of herpes. I was just in the neighborhood. No you weren't. No I wasn't, you're right. Well, it is technically my happy hour. So unless you care to join me. Actually I would. Okay. It's funny, I didn't know Pastor's drank. Oh, we prefer wine. This could peel paint. Why are you here? And no sermons. No sermons. An apology actually. I'm sorry I made you feel like a... A reclamation project? You brought up some deep stuff that I thought I had dealt with a long time ago and I know it's not the same. I thought I could heal myself by helping you. And you remembered I can't do that. Okay. So what is the point of being a Christian if you're just as messed up as the rest of us? I don't get it. Like I know you think my calling is to run around saving people, but it's not. It's simply to meet people right where they are. And I lost track of that and I'm sorry. Trust me, I am usually much better at this. Trusting is not one of my strong suits. Well, thanks for the drink and not slamming the door in my face. - Well, it was a 50 - 50 chance. But I wanted you to have my contact information. I'm not gonna bother you again. You don't even have to use it, but if you need anything, I'm here. Just, here. Bob, you have one job. Fix my sink. Gosh, no. Well, don't you look. Don't be a jerk. Someone who needs a drink. Yes. Rough week? You tell me. I was late to work, I got chewed up by my boss. And I got stalked by a pastor. Stalked by a pastor? Yes. And the landlord is on my case for rent, which I don't have. He is too lazy to fix my broken faucet, which I do have. And my ex-boyfriend thanked me for breaking up with him because apparently I'm the reason that he was drinking too much. Wow. I mean, most people come in here with cancer or divorce, but you are a whole new level. See, there you go being a jerk. Sue me. Why is all of this happening to me? It's gonna get better, you'll see. Are you sure? Look at all the good karma you're storing up. The transplant and all. A good deed like that can't go unrewarded. So, just hang in there. Right. Hang in there. You don't have to be so tough all the time you know. It's just easier. Than feeling? There's no way to live. It's just me. I'm sorry. I have a lot on my plate. So Trey, I don't suppose you know how to fix a broken sink, do you? I'm not much of a handyman. Hey, just call a plumber and problem solved. Right, problem solved. Hey Mands. You don't look so hot. I'm fine. You want to mind your own business? Stop calling me Mands. Excuse me. I ordered a latte with almond milk. Okay. This has soy. Tastes fine to me. Okay, but they're different. They're different? How so? Do you want to explain to me the difference between soy milk and almond milk? How about you just clock in, since you seem to know the difference so well. Why am I even having this conversation with you right now? I'll make you a new one, no prob. Almond milk latte and a blueberry scone on the house. What was that? What was what? Oh, don't get cute with me Amanda, this is serious. You know, I've put up with a lot from you, let a lot of things slide. You're late, you're angry and now you're drunk picking fights with the customers. Come on, I'm not drunk. Seriously, you'd put that on me. You're supposed to my friend. Oh please, don't play the friend card. Friends don't treat each other the way you treat me. Was your dad even sick? No, no, no operation right? Exactly. Wanted a little time off. Made it all up, knowing that I would believe you give it to you. Listen, I know I messed up all right. I'll go back in and apologize, I won't do it again. No, that's not necessary. You're done. Are you firing me? Yeah. I need this job. I don't care. You're gonna ruin our friendship just like that? Oh yeah, I'm ruining it. Yeah. It's never you, is it? No, I guess not. You'll have your rent when you fix my sink. Amanda, I need you. I'm not doing this. Amanda. No, go away or I'm calling the police. Okay, I'll go. I promise, I'll go, but I need to tell you something. Save your breath, you're getting what you deserve. I know I am honey. I know I am. I let everyone think that I had completed all the 12 steps in recovery hun, but I didn't, it was a lie. I didn't complete step number nine. It's the one where you make a deliberate attempt to amend any harm that you've done to anyone that's out there except when it does more damage to them. Except when it injures them more and you see, I convinced myself that trying to make amends with you would injure you more than what I'd already done. And that was wrong. That was a lie. The truth is that I was afraid. I was afraid to face you. I was afraid to admit what I had done. Like you said, I'm still a coward. But I can't run from it anymore Amanda, not anymore. Not now, I'm out of time. Look, you were right. I never believed in hell but as much as it terrifies me to think of that. I would go there if I knew that it meant that I could undo everything that I've done to you. Goodbye Amanda. How are we feeling? About the same as we probably look. How long have I've been out of surgery? About 100 pages worth. This doesn't mean I forgive him. I just didn't want to be the one to let him die you know? I couldn't live with that guilt for the rest of my life. I know. You want me to forgive and forget. I just can't, I can't. Oh, you won't forget and that's okay. And forgiveness, that'll come with time and with God. I'm sorry, a little sermon. I can't have him my life. I'll never be able to trust him. Amanda, Hank didn't make it. He died on the operating table. It was his heart. He went into cardiac arrest. The doctors couldn't save him. I'm so sorry. I guess that's it. Like you said, we're all gonna die someday right. I couldn't let him die and I couldn't save him. What does that say about me? You did the right thing. I'm really tired. Is it okay if I check on you tomorrow? Claire, do you think he really changed that much? Yes. Yes I do. I don't have your rent, Bob. I haven't fixed your sink. What are you doing here? I just wanted to give you this, it's money I took from your fridge. What did you do, did you rob the store? No, the band booked a gig, a tour. Can you believe it? I know, right? I mean, the tour, the bus, the company, they got a bus and everything. It's really great. I can go get your guitar for you. Nah, I don't need it. Sell it. Go to Venice. All right, here's the thing. Since I had no guitar, we'd been rehearsing with me just singing. It turns out, I sound better when I don't play. Go figure. Go figure. Thank you. Sure, I better get going. We're leaving for Ohio tonight. Richie, I'm really sorry for making it seem like this is all your fault. It's not, I'm like way too messed up to be in a relationship right now, you know? Yeah. Still gonna miss you though. Hey Richie. Yeah? Good luck on your tour.
