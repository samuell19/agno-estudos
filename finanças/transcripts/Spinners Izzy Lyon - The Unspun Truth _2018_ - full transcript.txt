We owe our very existence to what is essentially sign spinning. I am Mordecai Frederick son ton III, Professor of Spinthropology here at the Tuskegee Institute of Technology. The essence of sign spinning is in our very own DNA, from the colorful dance of the bird of paradise, to the common male bullfrog inflating its vocal sack. These are the sign spinners of the evolutionary world. Spinning is life for me. I can't think of anything else I'd rather do. When I'm up there on stage, I feel like I'm spinning for the whole world. Maybe even the universe. Or maybe I'm standing still and the universe is spinning for me. It's dope. Doper than dope. In 1987, one man changed the world. His name was Izzy Lyon and he was the greatest sign spinner of all time. Join us as we take a look behind the sign at the forgotten legend who disappeared and took the sport of sign spinning with him. And cut. All right, did you like that one? There's definitely something here. Okay, that's lunch. Run a half. Remember, there's no shame in using cue cards. Thank you. Did I look like I needed cue cards, Rick? - Yeah, it did actually. - Thanks, Rick. Energy people, energy. This is gonna be great. Sign spinning is huge. You nail this, we're gonna talk about that spoken word porn doc next. Good, Rick, we're good. Yeah. Great. ♪ You keep it ♪ ♪ Spinnin' round, round, round ♪ ♪ Everything you do just spins me round ♪ ♪ You keep it spinnin', wow ♪ Mr. Steinbergstein. Are you Heather? I am. Thank you for coming. Thank you for meeting me here. I like to think of this place as my home away from the car. Let's just get right to it and maybe just start off by telling us a little bit about yourself. Well, my name is Shecky Steinbergenstein and I'm Izzy Lyon's manager. I have been since day one and I still am today, even though I have no idea where he is. - When did you first? - Oh joy. Mr. 3% tip is here. Darla. What'll it be today? Oh geez, I must have left my wallet at home. No, you know what? We got this. So, have whatever you think. Well, in that case, I'll take the bagel with nova lox. Make that in everything bagel, grilled, not toasted. And, are you Jewish? No. And then round a bacon for the table. I kind of feel guilty when I don't keep kosher, but when in Rome. And a Diet Coke. I first met Izzy in 1987. I had just bought a beautiful brand new used car. So I'm driving around and I see this kid with a very geometrical hair fro spinning a sign in front of a shop. And get this, there was a massive crowd of people around him, tossing nickels and dimes. So I get outta my car, I toss a hat in front of him. I start doing a little barking. He made $150 in the first hour. That's when I ran into his brother, Marcus. No, that crazy old man didn't run into me. He drove into me. My name is Marcus Lyon, Lyon with a Y. And I'm also the brother of the world's greatest sign spinner, Izzy Lyon. Those were the good old days, right? My brother would be spinning signs and I'd be rolling dimes. That's like slang for picking up the tips, 'cause he would get a lot of tips. But they weren't actually dives. They were quarters. Got a silver dollar one time. I kept that. You gotta understand, what Izzy was doing back then was stuff that nobody had ever seen before. I mean he was just, just raw talent. You know what I'm saying? Talent? Did you say talent? Then you must be talking about me. Oh boy, here comes trouble. Trouble, I'll give you trouble. In your ass. I'm Li'I Marcus Lyon, the puppet of the brother of the world's greatest sign spinner, Izzy Lyon. After Izzy, you know, disappeared, I found myself drawn to comedic puppeteering performance with this guy. And we've had a fair amount of success. A five pound block of government cheese. It's a good crowd. Rolling room only. Izzy schmizzy, I'm tired of talking about Izzy. Hey, come on man. You know what I got to Izzy don't? What? Your hand up my ass. I'm sorry about him. He tends to get a little excited when he has an audience. Especially when that audience is a sexy blonde reporter lady. You ever had a hand up your... Okay, that's enough. I'm sorry, that's really inappropriate. Everything that we're talking about, it all started right here at Lyon Signs. Signs. Growing up, we didn't have much. We were so poor, we couldn't pay attention. You weren't even there. My pops made a decent living making signs for local businesses. Anybody who needed a sign, he would make it. Although some of his work was considered controversial. Some of it? Hm. Pop liked to work subtle political references into his signs. Wasn't nothin' subtle about it. Yeah. Pops used to like to think that he invented the black power fist. Come on, Marcus. - Do I have to? - Mm hm. Izzy's father spent years teaching the boys the family business, but Izzy wasn't interested. Are you gonna eat that? No, I kinda lost my appetite. Well you need some nutrition. - Oh no. - Here, just take a little bite of that. Look, the airplane into the hangar. Come on. - You're kidding. - Just a bite. - That's a big piece of bacon. Just a little bite, just a tad. This is like being at the deli. Izzy didn't wanna be making signs. He was too busy spinnin' 'em. Yeah, but that did not sit well with Pops. He didn't like that Izzy didn't wanna be part of the family business, but Mom, on the other hand, she actually dug it. Mom had been a majorette in high school. That's white peoples for baton twirler. And she taught him everything she knew. Yeah, like how to abandon a family. So after I signed him to my agency, I hired him to spin at my car wash. Business went bonkers. The kid was gold. What would you say was Izzy's breakout moment? Feed the children. From the Poker King Lounge, the second annual Feed da Children's telethon, where I'm told we got the best entertainers south of 95th and Pulaski. The first time I saw Izzy, it was on the TV. My name is Mary-Ellen Bower. I am the founder and president of the official Izzy Lyon fan club. I am also the author of the ultimate fans guide to Izzy Lyon. I was making homes hot venison stew. I had just separated the hind quarters from the carcass and I saw something that would forever change my life. Izzy Lyon. Welcome back to Chicago's Feed da Children telethon. And without further ado, Izzy Lyon. When I saw that sign spin around like a halo of light from the heavens, I realized my calling in life. That was the beginning of the fan club. This guy is spin-tacular. And these phones, they're ringing off the hook. Keep calling, send some money for the kids. We need to feed the kids. I knew at that moment, everything was gonna change. Izzy was so incredible at that telethon that everybody wanted a piece. You want a piece? I got a piece. Where, in your pants? Don't take my goddamn jokes. Sorry. Before I knew it, I had Izzy booked on every major news and radio program in the state of Illinois. Well, it just went up and now it's down. He's caught it and he's still spinning. Wow, we wanna spin. Forget Beatlemania, it's Izzymania. Last night sold out performance was canceled when fans broke through the venue's revolving doors. No one was injured, although many reported severe boats of dizziness. Now at that point, things got so crazy that Shecky decided to hire some muscle. Did Mr. Lyon need protection? Well, he did when I was around. I'm Antoine St. Poupon, former celebrity protection specialist to Izzy Lyon. Hey, that's my crayon. Just one second. Dolores, if you keep that up, you're going to lose your crayon privileges for a week. Excuse me. - What? Did Dolores take her meds? Don't worry about it. - Okay, let me see. - No, no, no, no. Stop that. Stop! She's new. He was on television. Did you ever go on television? Think about that. An eternity of boring sausage. Thank you, Izzy Lyon. Thank Meatshire Farm. Meatshire Farm, set your inner meat free. I'm not afraid to admit that I shoved a few of these in my mouth over the years. This one here is the Izzy signature sausage. So would you consider sign spinning a sport? We consider sign spinning an athletic art form. My name is Phil Alden. I'm the historian and curator at the... And custodian. At the Spinternational Hall of Fame. They didn't have another available office. Right, mother? On the one hand, you have muscle and endurance and rhythm, complicated moves, precise balance. And on the other hand, you have a beautiful representation of light and love, joy and freedom. See, that's what Izzy Lyon did as the first superstar of this international world. Um, excuse me. Oh yes, can I help you? My daughter is just the biggest sign spinning fan. Oh, is that so? Mm hm. Oh, wow. How wonderful. She loves Izzy Lyon. I love the Lyon king. Course you do. Where is his exhibit? - Oh. - Good point. Does he have his own wing or? Izzy is not represented here. It's tragic. But I can talk about it. But, I wanna see Simba. Well there's no question Izzy Lyon was an incredible spinner, but it's the official stance of the Hall of Fame that he's far too controversial to be represented here. My name is Brian Culero, and I'm the founder and CEO of the Spinternational Hall of Fame. Those bastards will do anything to keep his name out. Keeping Izzy out of the hall of fame is a total injustice, you know. Years before I founded the Hall of Fame, the business side of spinning was like the Wild, Wild West. I, for a time, did financial deals for several of the top spinners, including Mr. Lyon. I never trusted that guy. Well, we had a bit of a falling out, but I harbor no ill will toward Izzy whatsoever. Can you give me more specific reasons for omitting Izzy from the Hall of Fame? Well, where to begin? A long history of drug and alcohol abuse, bizarre and questionable spinning techniques, behavioral problems. Look, our organization is for families. For the children. We strive to maintain a wholesome image. There's no question that Izzy was and always will be the greatest sign spinner of all time. It's obvious they don't like him. If he gets in, they all move down a notch. But you've been attempting to get him inducted. Is that correct? Yeah, you're damn right. Me and Mary-Ellen. Why is it so important to you personally? Oh, it's everything to me. I know this may sound weird to you, I am who I am because of Izzy. I know I only met him once, but it was the best day of my life. I will honor him until the day I die forever and ever, amen. After Izzy disappeared, Mary-Ellen and I spent all of our time and her money trying to find him. We had a search party and everything. Pretty damn good party too, but it wasn't enough. Eventually, we ran outta resources. Now over here, we have the map of every Izzy sighting. Like right here, this is the last place someone saw Izzy. You think he's in there somewhere? Are you kidding me? Take a close, very, very close look. Do you see it? I'm not sure what I'm looking for, to be honest. - Don't touch it. This right here, his high top fade. I'd know it anywhere. Yeah. - Yeah. - Yeah. Tonight on Unresolved Mysteries, where Izzy? Hi, Chuckie. It's my last show. Good luck, Izzy. I hope you don't disappear after your show. Don't worry, I won't disappear. Forever. If you have any information on the whereabouts of Izzy Lyon, please call our toll free number. You know, you go through a lot of emotions when someone you love and respect flies off into the night, never to be seen again. Izzy was pure and innocent. So many big time celebrities are in it for the money. Not Izzy. No. It was all about the art. By 1989, Izzy was spinning for some of the world's largest companies. Tost Products introduced Izz-O's cereal. He had his own Spintendo game called Spinstar and was the new face of Quick Cuts, the national chain of hair salons. Spinning is life. I can't think of anything else I'd rather do. When I'm up there on stage, I feel like I'm spinning for the whole world. Maybe even the universe. Or maybe I'm standing still and the universe is spinning for me. ♪ I want you ♪ Izzy Lyon had become one of the wealthiest spinners in America and he wasn't afraid to show it. Welcome to another edition of Rich People and the Way They Live. Join me as we take a look into the lavish life of the hottest sign spinner in North America. Izzy Lyon has become Hollywood's wealthiest celebrity. Welcome aboard, Mr. Lyon. Hey Jack. Whether he's relaxing by the pool at his Hollywood estate or the jacuzzi in his Chicago penthouse, there can be no shortage of leisure for Izzy Lyon. Oh, everybody recognized Mr. Lyon. Wow. I'm the one that had to teach him the art of the disguise. Check this out. Hello? Hello. Still me. The more the changeability, the better that disguise. Do you know what I mean? You look, you look confused. Hello? You don't know. Because of Izzy, sign spinning became bigger than the NBA and ALS combined. Spinning was the newest craze. And this surge of spinthusiasm paved the way for new talent from all over the world. The British spinvasion was an incredible migration of spinners from the UK. They flooded into the American scene. The most notable of which was of course the illustrious Ritchy Round. Are you serious? You've never heard of me? Have you been living under a bloody crumpet? I just need you to say it once for the documentary, please. My name is Ritchy Round and I am the greatest sing spinner of all time. In the world. Ever. Although Ritchy Round was Britain's top spinner, here in the states, Izzy was number one. But as Ritchy's popularity grew, so did a rivalry between the two spinners. Ha. That's like saying there's a rivalry between spotted dick and Godzilla. Well I'm Godzilla and I eat dick for breakfast. Of course there were many other famous spinners you probably don't remember. Oh my God, there were so many, there was Wyatt Slurp. He stood in an enormous vat of soda while he spun. You had the Spin Twins, the Spinster. Spinderella. Rotating Ron. Bruce Spinsting. Then of course there was the Four Fingered Sam, who then became Three Fingered Samantha. I really like Spaghetti Hot Brown Spinetti. He was Italian. Spinergy. Don't forget Spincest. Oh, right, right. They were a family act. Kinda. The Spin Minion. There were 10 of them. Spinni Vanilli, but they were fakes. Jokers. In 1990, while performing at a music festival in Memphis, Tennessee, Izzy met Rhonda Jackson, a backup dancer for hip hop artist MC Hammer. So at first he was like uh huh, and then I was like nuh uh, and then he was like uh huh, and then I was like mm. And then he was like, uh huh. And I was like, aight. I'm Rhonda Jackson-Lyon. I was married to Izzy. I don't know what he saw in her. I know other women who would've been much better for him. Did I think that Rhonda was the right woman for Izzy? Well, not really. But she made him happy, so I went along with it. Rhonda wasn't nothing but a gold-diggin' ho. ♪ Give me your love ♪ ♪ I can't keep givin' you all my love ♪ So this one time Izzy took us all the Milan. It was something stupid, like celebrating his birthday. Anyway, I saw this cute pair of solid gold diamond plated Versace sunglasses. And Marcus, that selfish prick, he gon' say she don't need another pair. Can you believe that? The woman's got some issues. Bitch is out her mind. I'm sorry about that. So I told Izzy if I can't have those Versaces, I better get something almost as good. Big ass ring. Wow. And you're still wearing it. Would you give back this bling? A mere six months after meeting, Izzy and Rhonda were married in Chicago. It was an event like no other. The tabloids, they went nuts with it. It was not that over the top. I mean, not like they made it out to be. It was way over the top. Who doesn't have little people holding up their tables. Come on. I gave 'em a break. Well, one. I was so young. I just don't think that I was ready for all that. Attention. Tyrone, don't make me put you back in the house. Back then, let me tell you, Izzy was making a lot of money. Those early deals I made for Izzy should have made him rich for a very long time. Sadly, didn't work out that way. His debts were mounting, and it was all happening in the public eye. That must have been very hard for Izzy. Izzy blew all our money and then that mouth of his got him into some big trouble. Man, do you remember this? I said it, I am bigger than Michael Jordan. But I appreciate the fact that you have the courage to admit it. I mean, my hair's better than his, right? Yeah, even I couldn't get behind him on that one. The same reporters that loved Izzy before, well, they turned on him. He let his ego get the best of him. You show me someone who's great who doesn't have an inflated ego. Look, Izzy had his faults. Sure. But is that a reason to keep out of the hall of fame? No. - No. At the Los Angeles Coliseum, on September 9th, 1992, Izzy made history when he introduced the helicopter. Oh, the helicopter was something special. Get this, instead of spinning one sign, Izzy spun two. And he got him spinning so fast, he levitated three inches off the stage. It was like Jesus rising from the grave. Well, if Jesus would've been a sign spinner. The fans went bonkers. He told me he was working on a new trick. The man defied gravity. Amateur and professional spinners from all over the world tried to mimic the helicopter, but no one could pull it off. But then a young boy named Bobby Freeze seriously injured himself attempting the helicopter. He got impaled on his sign. Left him seriously handicapped for life. He lost some of his biggest endorsement contracts. That's when we separated, I had had enough. I had to move back into our four bedroom penthouse in Chicago. And that thing only had one jacuzzi in it. It was horrible. But it's getting better. Izzy is an international threat. His helichopper move is killing our children. Have you seen that little boy? He looks like a monster. Mr. Lyon, what about this controversy? Look, those mad moves you see me doin' like the helicopter, those are for professionals. Kids can't be trying that. It's way too dangerous. Okay? No further questions. Thank you, thank you. Even though Izzy spoke out against untrained spinning, the controversy over what became known as the heli-chopper would forever damage his reputation. Naturally, people were very upset. There was a huge backlash from his fans. Down with Izzy. Down with Izzy. Down with Izzy. Geez, I thought it was tough guarding Izzy before. You ever try protecting someone from being mutilated by an angry mob? Not as easy as it sounds. We have confirmed famed sign spinner Izzy Lyon has been shot during his performance at Madison Square Garden. I saw it on the TV. I just leaned over and barfed. It was the saddest day of my life. Jesus. I didn't even hear the shot. The crowd was so loud. My ears were ringing for days afterwards, which was particularly odd 'cause I wasn't even at the show. Izzy Lyon has been brought to Rush St. Luke hospital in Manhattan. Oh, wait a minute. We understand his condition is stable. The shooter has not been found, but this surveillance photo clearly shows the assassin taking aim moments before the fatal event. That clown's not looking for any laughs. Is he? Too soon, Mona. Too soon. Oh yeah, that was bloody awful. So Sad. Is that the word? Sad. There were plenty of suspects, but without any hard leads, the police were useless. It could have been anybody, even me. It wasn't. It could have been, it wasn't, it wasn't, it wasn't. Well, I said it could have been anybody. I'm anybody. I'm not nobody, I'm, I'm me. Now he's the one that's supposed to be guardin' Izzy, right? But supposedly he's off playing patty cake with some floozy somewhere. As I remember it, she had just finished showing me the tattoo on her prosthetic arm. When I heard what I would normally call the sound of unemployment. As fate would have it, Izzy was spinning a titanium sign that night. Deflected the bullet. So who do you think is responsible? To quote the great Remington Steele, follow the money. So is it just a coincidence that you took out a $10 million life insurance policy about a week before Izzy was shot? Hell yeah. It don't mean nothing. My friend Mercedes bought her a new Hyundai Sonata with the platinum package. Got it insured. Wrapped it around a pole same day. Is she guilty of murder? I don't think so. Oh, CSI up in here. After the attempt on his life, Izzy spent time in a New Jersey hospital, recovering from the emotional and physical trauma. While there he met Barbi Fratelli, an 18 year old Jersey girl who quickly became his close friend and confidant. Yeah, so I was in the hospital with the irritated booty sickness. IBS, right? Hi, my name is Barbi Fratelli, owner of Barbi's Barking Beauties. I'm a canine cosmetologist. And I am a former best friend of Izzy Lyon. Friend. So anyways, I see across the hall this man and I says, oh my God, I've seen that man on TV. I gotta meet him. So I go across the hall and it's Izzy. And forget about it. After that, it was like peas and meat sauce. And look at this, voila, Italian ice. Yeah, they got real close. Little too close, if you ask Rhonda. Shit, was all up inside her, like you up in me. Only it wasn't his hand. Come on, man. You know, Rhonda and Izzy were separated at the time, but she didn't even come to visit him in the hospital. Someone tried to kill him, for criminy Pete's sake. Why didn't you go to visit Izzy when he was in the hospital? Visit him? Separated or not, how would you feel if your man spent all his time with an 18 year old hussy? Just because he almost got killed, that doesn't make it okay. I was in Cancun anyway. No, we was not like together in like a sexual way. We was just friends. Oh my God, that looks good. Very pretty, come here. It's my interview, Marisa. Their relationship was all over the tabloids. And then Rhonda filed for divorce. It was awful. It really broke Izzy's fragile little heart. Did you date Ritchy Round to get back at Izzy? Yes I did. And let's just say they grow 'em real small in Great Britain. It didn't last. Rhonda. Did I shag a Rhonda? Oh yes. Rhonda Lyon. She was a treasured conquest. Ritchy wanted everything Izzy had. I'm glad he never came from me. Izzy ran off to Las Vegas with that Barbi woman. Hussy. Thank you. I mean, I thought I was helping him, you know? I mean, don't get me wrong, we had a lot of good times, but you know, I could tell he was very sad. A lot of people don't know, Izzy was very tender and emotional. But you know, sign spinners, they got feelings too. People forget that. Beautiful, look at this one. This one is a tribute to Monet's Water Lilies. You wanna come around, do the camera like 360 around the dog? No, okay. Izzy's career was on life support. Fans wondered if he'd ever return to the spotlight. For the 18th time, Brian Culero is unavailable. Have a spinderful day. If we could just talk to Brian, maybe we'd have a chance. All we want them to do is to hear us out. Show 'em the book, Mary-Ellen. I've been preparing this for years. This is my Izzy Bible. It has every amazing achievement, every award, every honor, every act of goodwill. We even have a presentation all planned out. With music and fireworks and laser lights and dancing pigs. How are we ever gonna afford all that? We got music. Sheldon Steinbergenstein. Shecky, this is Marcus. Hi, Marcus. - What's up? - We think it's time to go back to the Hall of Fame and give 'em the what for. Again? This time we've got a documentary crew coming with us. Woohoo! Holly weird, here we come. Ta da. We're back. Can I help you? We don't mean to bother you, but... Oh yes we do. We want to talk to Brian. I can't help you. Brian is unavailable. What do you mean, unavailable? Unavailable as in not available. Oh really? Hey, you can't go up there. Ritchy. Hello, darlings. Why, you blimey son of sheckle-less... Shecky, you old geezer, is that you? You know it is. Bloody hell, mate. You look old. Like Old Testament old. The years have not been kind to you. Oh, by the way, my good side is on my right. Well hello, little bird. And who might you be? Who, me? I'm Mary-Ellen. Look at you with your little glasses and your colorful windbreaker. You're like a magnificent peacock with all your feathers just. Erect. Oh my. All right, can we get to the point here? Yes, let's. What can I do for you fine people? We're here to see Brian. Right, right. Well, the thing about that is Brian's a bit occupied. He's always occupied. A man can't be occupied forever. Depends on what he's occupied with. All right, this is bullshit, Ritchy. He can't just keep avoiding us. What's going on out there? You have some visitors. I know, I can hear them. Who is it? It's that Shecky guy and... Oh good Lord. They have a camera crew with them. I told them that you weren't here, but they won't leave. Are you coming out? Why are you whispering? Wait. Am I on speaker? Yes you are. I'll be right out. He'll be right out. Well, I'll be a bobtailed bastard. Shecky Sheckenbergenstein It's Steinbergenstein. And you brought your friends. Is that Marcus Lyon? This is. And this bubbling cauldron of smelted ore is miss Mary-Ellen. Why haven't you returned my calls? Calls? I don't remember getting any calls. It is so hard to get good help these days. Now, what can I do for you? We wanna get Izzy Lyon in the Hall of Fame. Sheckles, how many times have we been through this? Hey guys. The man has been dead for 20 years. Hey, he is not dead. Yeah, don't say that. Look, we're all well aware of how controversial Izzy's career was. I cannot in good faith. Good faith, my ass. That's right, it's downright wrong not to include the greatest sign spinner that ever lived. Apparently you haven't seen my display in the main hall. You are not, and you never were the greatest. - Oh really? - Yeah. Well, that accomplished nothing. I told you guys, you should let me bring Li'I Marcus. We can't talk here, but I have some info that may be very valuable for your efforts. Why are you whispering? Can we meet somewhere more private? Why sure, just gimme your number. Don't you know, those things can be traced. Think! What the hell are you doing? That's. - Excuse me. - Did you just? I'm at work, I can't talk right now. I can't believe you did this. It's about the size of a plum. No, moderate swelling. It's more burny than stab by. I don't know, how much is a lot of blood? I'll get you a specimen. Okay, I gotta go. I love you too, Mother. Alrighty, bye bye. What? Sorry about that. Meet me here tonight. What's your name? I've said too much already. Don't think so. You really haven't said anything. Hey, I hope you plan on paying for this. This is an expensive phone. I think his mother's a doctor. Oy vey. Are you sure this is where he said to meet him? This is my kind of place. Oh, there he is. Hi. Yoo hoo. This is a nice place. Are you a regular here? No. Lookin' good, Phil. Who exactly are you, man? My name is Phil Alden, I'm the curator and custodian at the Spinternational Hall of Fame. Okay. Well, Phil Alden, you said you had something for us. I can get you into a meeting with Brian Culero next week. Is that so? Yes. Wednesday night. The entire board will be there, not just Brian and Ritchy. It sounds important. Oh, it is. It's very important because that's the night they'll be voting in the new inductees. I'm not buying it. They put you up to this. No, I can't stand them. They make me clean the toilets. But more importantly, I love Izzy and I want in. In what? Your little circle. All right, you're in. Before you say no, let me just say I was never able to spin because of an inner ear infection. Actually, he said that you're... But I devoted my life to this. And to see those two, pardon my French, standing in the way of Izzy's induction, it's just wrong. We would love your help. If I could just have a little peace and res... Shut up and listen! You're in! Oh my God, really? Why would we even think they'd listen to us? I happen to know that a couple of the board members are big Izzy fans. Oh, maybe we have something here. Quit sulking. I'm not sulking. I'm just saying having a performance without the most talented member of the group doesn't make sense. Li'I Marcus would kill. Look at that. Our friend Speed Racer actually came through. Our friend Speed Racer actually. All in favor of wasting a great deal of money to hire a full-time custodian when we have a truly fantastic one sitting right here in the room. - Hi. - Phil. You're not on the board. Legally, I could stab you right now. We talked about this. Sounds like they're already voting. I will come to your house and I will kill your family. Brian. I will kill your mother while you watch. You know, I'm a board member. Are you ready? You're darn tootin' I am. I've been waiting my whole life for this. You talk again, and I will kill your family. And, having nothing further to discuss, we move on. ♪ It's somebody's birthday ♪ But nobody here. Listen, mate, you're not allowed to barge in here. We're in the middle of a very important meeting. I invited them. You are the people who decide who gets inducted into the Hall of Fame, and these fine, intelligent, dedicated, devoted. Fuck's sake, get on with it, man. They just want Izzy Lyon in the Hall of Fame. I'm not gonna stand for this. It's crooked, it's backhanded. I don't like it. Precisely. This meeting is adjourned. - Wait. I'd like to hear what they have to say. I agree. All right, all right. Get on with it. Hit it, Marcus. ♪ Izzy Lyon, number one ♪ ♪ World's greatest spinner signer, made for sun ♪ ♪ Skill, charm, high top fade ♪ ♪ We really wish he would a stayed ♪ ♪ Oh wicky wicky wicky ♪ ♪ Izzy Lyon ♪ ♪ Number one ♪ ♪ Skill, charm, high top fade ♪ Oh no. ♪ Izzy should be in the Hall of Fame ♪ Okay then, all in favor of the motion to nominate Isaac Tiberius Lyon to the Spinternational Hall of Fame. - Aye. - Aye. Neither of you has a vote. Aye. Aye. I raised my hand by accident. All opposed. Nay. Nay, I guess. I vote nay as well. The motion is denied. The matter is settled. I told you this would've gone better If we used Li'I Marcus. God dammit. Brian, you cannot intimidate people into voting the way you want them to. I can, and I just did. This is ridiculous. I quit. Fine, is that all? No. As a matter of fact, it's not all. I hate cleaning your toilets. Your cologne makes me sick and I don't wanna be your punching bag anymore. And I hated shining your shoes. And my office is in a closet, for the love of God. Look here, Philip, you've got balls after all. You got anything else to tell us? I'm gay. - Yeah. - See. Of course. We know you're gay. We all knew that. I think this meeting has been most informative. Phil, you're free to collect your belongings. As for the rest of you, this meeting is adjourned. I think we've all had enough drama for one day. Hey, hey, hey, this is not over. I think it is. Thanks, man. I don't even know why I keep getting my hopes up. Me neither. I knew it wasn't gonna work. Maybe now is a good time to seek professional help. You mean like a psychiatrist? I mean a lawyer. We can fight this. Lawyer? We don't have any money. Somebody better have some money. You ain't paid your tab. What about Izzy's royalties? Marcus, you must get some money. We ain't get shit. All right, I've had enough of this. Shecky? This whole thing is perverse! Better relax, old man. Who you calling old man? Shecky, whatever you're thinking, don't do it. Come at me. I'll show you, you giant chunk of ostrich pink. Eat wood, bonehead. Ouchie. Oh my. Look, to be honest, Izzy is not getting into that Hall of Fame. They can't do this. They must be doing something illegal. It ain't illegal to be an asshole. When you hit rock bottom and life just beats the heck outta ya, you've got to fight back. The special thing about rock bottom, there's only one place to go, forward and up. I will tell you, I always thought Shecky was a little bit crazy, but he had some good ideas. I sure did. The show was called Spintacular, Spintacular. I said, look, Izzy, if we want to get back in the game, you better show the world you're still the best. It was a one night only event at Soldier Field back in Chicago. 80,000 tickets sold out within an hour. Parking was extra. I was very honored. Izzy allowed me to design his costume for that show. I mean, it was sparkly and fabulous in an understated sort of way. You came from nothing. This kid from the south side, no money, no connections. And look at you now. What is it like to be you? It's dope. Doper than dope. It was a security nightmare. I was on pins and needles. Scratch that, I was, I was on pills and needles. I love Izzy, and I don't care what anyone thinks! He's gorgeous. He's gorgeous. He's got a beautiful nose. Clearly the fans were anxious to see him after he'd been gone for so long. And no one knew where he was. You'd think after almost being killed, that would be enough to stop a bloke. But no, he has to come back. Have you ever felt like this about anybody before? No. And that's what so crazy about it. I have to admit his performance was pretty phenomenal, especially for someone who so clearly past his prime. Everyone agreed it was the most beautiful thing they'd ever seen. It's like Izzy was a divine being. I mean, the audience, they went crazy for him. They gave him a perfect 10. You know what I give him? I give him a fuckin' two, that's what I give you, Izzy, a two. Or if you're from America, one of these. I'm not sticking around, I'm going. This is bullshit. Yeah, I remember right before Izzy left the stage, he turned to the audience, you know, this was after his third encore, he said, thanks for standing by me through the good times and the bad. It was a miracle. I'd seen him levitate before, but I had no idea that kid was gonna fly. It's true. I have had clients croak on me, but never just vanish. Is my job done? Nope. Not until I'm fired or they're dead. That was the last time we ever saw Izzy. Yeah. Yeah. I never got any closure. That's why I hold onto of this stuff. What have we got there? This is my most prized possession. Sorry, Boba. Yeah. This is something Izzy gave me right before he went on stage for his final show. It's the last thing he ever gave me. Or anybody else, for that matter. Have you ever watched it? Watched it? No. Toshecky? Probably Japanese hentai porn. Give me some good old shoot 'em up any day. I'm more into like gun play porn, you know? Do it. Um, Mr. Poupon, I don't think that says Toshecky. I think you were supposed to give it to Shecky. Could I borrow that? What? Can I borrow that? Oh, I don't think so. No! This means the world to me! Antoine, what the hell's goin' on, man? Calm the heck down. I mean, what is the deal? I mean, look at you. Is your brain impacted too? What are you doing? Wearing Joe's security jacket again? Joe died. How long is this goin' on, man? You know, he ain't had his meds today. No, it's okay. He was just talking to me about his videotape. Videotape. What are you doing with the videotape? You know you ain't supposed to have no unauthorized videotapes here, Antoine. He's not? You give it up. Let me have it. - Closure. Let me have it. - Well, how about this? - Let me have it. What if I held onto it and kept it safe for you? It means a lot to me. I know, and I won't let it outta my sight. I could keep it real safe. Take good care of it. - What's the deal? Let me have it. Yeah, here we go. Keep it up, keep it up. We may have to lobotomize your crazy, cross-eyed Deputy Dawg ass, huh? Guess what I got in your meds tonight? Shecky, I'm sorry, but I'm out. Last night, I got a visit from a dude in a horse mask, and you know how much I hate horses. And no, this was not another one of my nightmares. This was real. This horse wants me gone, said he'd come after my family, said he'd come for you. Scared me shit less. It's gotta be the same guy that tried to get me in Madison Square. But I ain't stickin' around to find out. Nope. There was one other thing, I recognize voice. He kept calling me mate, said he was the greatest evil mass bloke in the world ever. So we're gonna leave, Sheck. Maybe you could find a way to make things right. Tell Marcus I love him. Tell my cars I love them. They've been like a father to me. And you know I love you too, you smelly bastard. Oh my. Well. This means Izzy may still be out there. Of course he is. Yes, and he's implicating. Yeah, I know who he's implicating. There's only one person in the world that talks like that. Wait, wait. So Ritchy tried to kill Izzy? And was a clown and a horse and was an evil, murderous clown horse. What does that even mean? Hey. Ow. Keep it together, man. Eyes on me. Ritchy is a dead man. Now Shecky, don't go crazy. Don't go crazy? You're telling me not to go crazy? I won't go crazy then. You know what, pissed off, I'm a little irritated, and a little, and you know what else I'm gonna go a little of? All right, all right, no! We all can't go crazy. She's right. Everybody needs to calm down. We need to handle this the right way. The right way, huh? - Yeah. - All right. Wait. Hey, hey, hey, I'm going with Marcus. Hey, Marcus, wait! Look, some guy making accusations on a videotape from 20 years ago isn't much to go on. Are you serious? I'm trying to take this as seriously as I can, but without hard evidence, there's really not much we can do. This way, then. That was fun. What did you expect? This whole thing was a waste of time. What the hell are you doin' bringing that dummy in there? - Shecky. - Don't you talk about Marcus like that. So what'd they say. They're not gonna do anything. I'll show them hard evidence. Those stuffed, possum-lipped pieces of frak. Hey. It's time we took matters into our own hands. Meaning what? Meanin' we need to kick Ritchy's ass. - Yeah! - No! That won't solve anything. If they want proof, we gotta give him proof. Believe me. I want to take that Ritchy and throw him to the ground and then hog time and then stick a gag ball in his mouth and then do shots of tequila from his navel, and then take a bunch of oil and then swirl it around. - Hey! - Phil's right. We need hard proof to get him arrested. And how are we gonna get that? Well, we could, uh. Well. I got a plan. But we're gonna need disguises. I like that. All right, tell me the plan one more time. It's pretty damn simple. We get in there and we bust open his head. Can we comb through that motherfucker's house until we find some proof he was responsible for this mess? Shecky? What are you wearing? Well, this is the only disguise I own. What, did I overaccessorize? We're gonna nail this sucker. Holy moly. It's huge. I haven't said that in years. Whoa, you don't believe it until you're standing right in front of it. Stupid asshole's got a castle. You got it from Derek Smalls in the '90s. Wow. Oh my. Is it illegal if we break in without getting permission? What the hell is wrong with you people? Hey, how do you know how to pick locks? I know how to do a lot of things. - What? - It's Ritchy. He's naked. Whoa. What the hell? This is some Game of Thrones bullshit. Aw, nuts. You guys, I think we may need to split up. Marcus, join me in the bedroom. I'm good. Hey, you and Mary-Ellen head upstairs, see if y'all can find anything. - 10-4. - 10-4. Come with me. I'm listening to a fricking puppet. He's mine. No, he's mine. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Isn't it wrong to kick somebody's when they're unconscious? Good point. Let's wake him up so we can feel it. Oh my God. He's more obsessed than I am. This is much more twisted than I ever imagined. Who could do such a thing? Oh, cupcake. Is that you? Yeah. Yeah, you know I like it rough. That's my cheesecake. Oh my God. This guy is sick. In my ass? I'll never eat a sausage again. Marcus, we got the tape. Can you get me the combination? How the hell are we supposed to do that? Persuade him somehow. Use your charm. Over. Wait a second. Why don't you invite your friends over and I'll give you whatever you want. Yeah, nah, I don't think so, man. No, this has gotten way outta control. I got this. What? I knew this day would come. What day? The day that I had to carry your sorry ass. Oh, you know you like it. You know you do. - No, no, no. Shh. Just remember, you're doin' this for Izzy. Doing what? - For Izzy. - What? For Izzy. No, no, no, no, no. For Izzy! Oh no. You're goin' where no man's gone before! - So disgusting. - Oh God. Look at this. What? And this. That's an odd prop for a clown. Mary-Ellen. Clowns don't use guns. No. Look. Oh my God, we actually did it. We did it. - We did it. - We did it. Sergeant Decker, please. Hey guys, I got the combination. It's 381. It was unlocked. And also empty. What? Look what we did find. We got you, you son of a bitch. Yeah, you bastard. What's wrong with Shecky? Hang on a sec. Do I know you? Where's Li'I Marcus. Li'I Marcus? Where? Li'I Marcus? Oh God. Oh, I'm so sorry. You okay? No! Oh, Marcus. No! No! Marcus, is that you? It's so cold. Just hang on, man. Just hang on. I don't feel so good. No, shh, shh! Save your strength. It's okay, you're gonna be all right. Tell Ritchy he's an asshole. No! No! No! No, no, no, no, no. Marcus, he's gone. No, he's not. This is the police. We have you surrounded. It's the police. Nobody panic! The police. I'm not goin' back to prison. Come out with your hands up. Lay down your weapons. Hey. Hey, don't take it so hard mate. I mean, it's not like it's the first time you've lost someone. That probably hurt. That is for Li'I Marcus. And this is for Izzy. For your own safety, please exit the castle. No, no, no. No, I didn't actually kill anyone. I didn't kill, I tried to kill someone. Of course. No, no, no, we can make a deal. We can make a deal. I know things. - Let's make a deal in here. I know things. I know things. I'm the greatest sign spinner in the world ever! In a bizarre turn of events, formally famed sign spinner Ritchy Round was taken into police custody today in connection with the unsolved 1994 assassination attempt on Izzy Lyon. I'm Ritchy Round. Number one in the world. Ever. During the arrest, Mr. Round was very vocal. Implicating Brian Culero, President and CEO of the Spinternational Hall of Fame in an elaborate multimillion dollar embezzlement scandal involving royalties belonging to Izzy Lyon. So we never did get Izzy into the Hall of Fame. Or find him, for that matter. But we won't stop looking. That's right. And now, maybe since Ritchy is out of the picture. I thought if I'm going down, Brian is going down with me. One minute you're the CEO of a respected establishment, next, you're making toilet wine to accompany the grilled cheese sandwiches you've made on an ironing board. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have a 2:30 game with Dirty Mike and the boys. This here is Big Bone. Turns out he's a massive Izzy Lyon fan. Massive. After he beat me all to shit, we've become close friends. Yeah, I did get a pretty good settlement. And I got my 20%, plus interest. In the end though, we decided to honor Izzy by doing something that would give back to the community. Thank you. Thank you. And welcome. You know, for the past year, my camera crew and I have followed this extraordinary committee on their journey to restore the legacy of a forgotten hero, Isaac Tiberius Lyon. Join me in giving them a round of applause. The Sheckster is back. Have you ever seen a more beautiful candy apple blue? Looks like old Shecky made out pretty good. Looks like my Li'I Marcus days are behind me. It hasn't been easy. I mean, I know I'm never gonna forget him, but at some point you gotta move on, you know? And I'm proud to say that I finally found a new hobby. Because today is the opening of the Izzy Lyon Spinstitution of Signery Arts. So, I'm gonna be teaching two classes. It's so exciting. Fan Club Leadership 101, obviously. And also I am gonna be training a whole new generation of private investigators to find Izzy. And who knows who else? This is Izzy Searchology 101. My name is Proof Mary-Ellen Bower. Now we're all here for the same reason, to find Izzy, wherever he may be on this world. Ladies and gentlemen, say hello to the first and only sign spinning school in America! Spin Signo Veritas! Spin Signo Veritas! I used to think that my best years were behind me, but now I realize that these are my best years. You are so strong. Mm. I feel like a royal. In the final analysis, perhaps sign spinning's almost mystical ability to gather people together is what makes it so fascinating. So compelling. So singular. Everyone watched our Izzy doc. You guys, you're a hit. We're a hit. I know. And this is a small token of our appreciation. Handcrafted. She's got a special gift. Thank you for sharing our story. It made a world a difference to all of us. Of course. I mean, you really shouldn't have, 'cause you know, it's beautiful? Is that a real gun? - Yeah, don't touch it. You gotta open the card first. Of course. Thanks guys. This is Heather. There's a Mr. Lyon waiting in the lobby for you. Mr. Lyon?

Brian, you know, I've told you many times what my secret is. What's your secret? Clean livin'. Are these cute? Look it. They keep 'em cool. This one, his owner is a crony, he's got like a fetish, but that's where I don't judge. If you bring me a dog, I give you back a pony. Now this, I know it's not politically correct, you know, 'cause it's on a white mannequin, but I wanted his, you know, his high top and his sunglasses to really pop out. And then the halo, because Izzy's an angel. I don't think that's healthy. Ah, old guy ain't so bad. When I'm 200, I hope I can throw a punch like that. It was just so touching and moving. You could tell Izzy was in it for the meat. Put your back into it. Oh yeah. Oh. Ooh. I loved Izzy. I loved him like a brother, like an adopted black brother. It's funny.
