Look, I've found it! Fifteen years ago, the Peking Man was sighted in a small village in the Himalayas. Except for an earthquake, those villagers have lived a peacefully for years. If we find the Peking Man, and bring him to Hong Kong, we'll be rich and famous. The animal is 50 feet tall and very strong. It won't be easy to catch him, but he's still an animal after all. With our intelligence, I believe we can outwit him. Yes, even if we don't catch him alive, we can turn him into a specimen. And we'd still rake in plenty of cash! That's right! I know of an explorer named Chen Zhengfeng. He also wants go to India to search for the Peking Man. He's been down since breaking up with his girlfriend. Zhengfeng. So, after our conversation, have you decided if you will lead us on the expedition? Have you given it a thought? Are you interested? Fine, let's go for it. I'll come with you. Let's go take a look. Come on, let's go. Zhengfeng. Please, follow me over here. Let me introduce you. Hello. This is Mr. Chen and Mr. Lin. There are six members on this expedition team. We welcome all of you and hope that you find the Peking Man soon. Keep in touch. Look! What's going on? Come on, let's help push. Hurry up. Let's move. I can't stand this heat. We still have a long way to go. Notice how we haven't seen anyone else these past few days? It's strange! How come this village is abandoned? Hey, is anyone here?! Stampeding elephants! -They're heading this way! Run! They're gone. -Get up. Let's move on. Come on, let's go. Zhengfeng, you've been very quiet since we stopped here. Are you alright? We're all in this together, we're all friends here. What's bothering you? Tell us. We might be able to help. It's not a big deal. Is it about your ex-girlfriend? I know you two broke up. There were only two people close to me in Hong Kong. One of them was my ex-girlfriend. She loves singing. The other was my brother, who works as a TV producer. He's very career minded. He hopes to be famous one day. Everything was going well, except... One day when I got home, I walked in on my brother and her... Zhengfeng! You two!... Why? Why her? I had no idea! I didn't know that you two... I didn't know! Believe me, I really didn't! Zhengfeng! It was because of that you decided to lead this expedition, right? Forget her, pal. There're plenty of nice girls out there. When we capture the Peking Man you'll be world famous. Women will be all over you. Get some sleep, we have a long day tomorrow. Come on. It's quicksand! Don't shoot! Why not? -You might hit him by mistake! Oh no! Get the first aid kit! Hurry! C'mon, hurry up! Why did you do that?! Why did you kill him?! Let me go! There was no point in saving him. He wouldn't have survived. We don't have enough medical supplies. I don't want to waste anything. -You!... This is it, I've had it! Let's go back to Hong Kong. There's no Peking Man here. We've wasted our time. Calm down everyone. I'm confident that we'll find the Peking Man. We've already come this far. We can't afford to go back empty handed. Right? Right! Then come on! Let's get going! Follow me! This footprint looks fresh! I'm sure it's not far from here! Let's go! Let's leave him here to die alone. Where is everybody? Stop it! Ah Wang, don't hurt him! Go! Drink. Drink up. Who?... Who are you? I'm Chen Zhengfeng. I'm here in search of the Peking Man. Don't worry, it's just a scratch. Who are you? Why are you here? I... Where are your parents? Papa and Mama... They are... Where? Where are they? -Close... Can you take me to them? -Okay, I'll take you. Wait a moment. This way. Come. Follow me. Look. Papa, Mama, and me. You see. Heavy rain... plane... crash... I understand, you've lived with the Peking Man all these years, right? I see, your name is Ah Wei. Ah Wei... yes. Hungry? We'll eat. Where's the food? Follow me. Jiji. Good boy. Go on. Come here. This way. I'm hungry. Hang on. This is good. It hurts. It hurts a lot. Thank you. Mr. Lu Tien. -Hello. I'm a reporter from the Daily News. -Please have a seat. About your expedition, how did it go? We combed through the entire jungle. There's no Peking Man. It's just a legend. I hear Chen Zhengfeng is still there looking. Is that right? Zhengfeng... There's no way he can survive in that jungle. He's probably already become some animal's dinner. Ah Wei, are you feeling any better? Ah Wang. Ah Wei. I want to take you and Ah Wang to Hong Kong tomorrow. He only listens to you. We'll take a cargo ship back. What do you think? Say, "Yes." -Yes. Goodbye. Jiji. Let's go. Goodbye, Jiji. Stop. Run! Run! Lie down and rest. I've been lookin' for you. I was looking for you too. I found the Peking Man. I've brought him with me. Let's take a look. Excellent! Zhengfeng, we'll find a large freighter and take him to Hong Kong. Please, no chains. Let him go, please? Don't worry and listen to me. The Peking Man is big and very powerful. If he isn't chained, he'll capsize the boat if he goes into a rage. We have to keep him chained. Don't cry, please. Zhengfeng, Ah Wang's been chained. Ah Wang is too powerful. We had to chain him. We'll free him once we're in Hong Kong. Oh, come here! Zhengfeng... Don't cry, Ah Wei. Look, I've got a present for you. Open it. You're back in civilization. You just can't wear those skins anymore. Change into this. Try it on. Try it. Mr. Lu, you can't just barge in! You should have knocked! Sorry, but I have good news for you. I just received a telegram from Hong Kong. It's all set. The Peking Man will be on show at the Hong Kong Stadium day after tomorrow. Tickets sold out in three hours. Isn't this excellent news? Think about it, we could take the Peking Man on a world tour in the future! We'll be rich! I don't approve using the Peking Man for financial gain. Zhengfeng, don't forget, you've signed a contract. You can't violate it. Anyways, the contract states that you will get 5% of the net profit. That's a lot of cash. Come have a drink with me. Let's celebrate, c'mon! Thank you. Congratulations, Mr. Lu. The Peking Man has brought you good luck. You'll be a rich man. Thank you. Gentlemen, champagne! Enjoy yourselves! It's my treat! A toast, cheers! Cheers! Captain, here is the weather report. Thank you. What's wrong, captain? It's this weather report. In five hours, we'll be in the middle of a very violent storm. I intend on changing course to Singapore. We'll sail to Hong Kong after the storm's over. Singapore? Absolutely not. I've already booked a show in Hong Kong. It's scheduled for the day after tomorrow. All the tickets have been sold! Who will take responsibility for my losses? And if there is a shipwreck, who'll be responsible? I'll take responsibility. This ship will be fine. We have to be in Hong Kong on schedule. I'll take all the responsibility. You already agreed. We have a contract, captain. If we don't arrive Hong Kong on time, your company will compensate my losses. What do you say to that? Well? Fine, Hong Kong it is. Ah Wei! -Zhengfeng! Ship's run aground! -I know! We need to reverse! Hurry up and do it! Ah Wang! Ah Wei! Ah Wei, come back! It's dangerous! Come back, hurry! Ah Wang, push the ship away! Push harder! Mom look, the Peking Man's here! Come look! That's Connaught Centre, Hong Kong's tallest building. You're back, Zhengfeng? You still mad at me? Boy, you have caused quite the headlines! It's truly amazing! Living in that jungle was tough for me. How've you been? Busy? Yeah. I'm working on a show today. If you have the time, drop by. Alright, I'll see you at the studio then. Sure, I'll be there soon. We're going to go see my brother. Taxi! I'm looking for producer Chen Shiyu. -Just a minute. Zhengfeng! You're here! Still the same, huh! This is Ah Wei, she's from the Indian jungle. This is my brother. Sir, lighting's set. We are ready to start. Okay, take them to the studio. And after the show we'll catch up. Right on. -This way please. Mr. Chen, Miss Wang wants to see you. Thank you. I won't be long. How are you? Have a seat. It's been a while. I don't know how to address you. You're a stranger to me now. Please stop. You... I was wrong. My arrogance blinded me. It was so out of line. I hurt you and myself as well. I'm very sorry about it. Let's not talk about the past. What has my brother... I mean you two... It's over between us. My brother's still a playboy. I'm going to have a talk with him later. There's no need. It's all over. I suffered and felt guilty this past year. What if you got into trouble in the jungle? I would have never forgiven myself. I prayed for you everyday. I hoped that you'd return in one piece. And here you are! Will you forgive me? Let's not dwell on it anymore. Come on, cheer up! Let's have fresh start. I'll make it up to you. Ah Wei! Zhengfeng! I'll explain later. Look at that! Mister, I want to go to the Hong Kong Stadium. Could you take me? Sure. Thanks. You're very stubborn. You think you don't have to listen to us? The audience wasn't happy. You got us into trouble, you deserve this. Stop it! Ah Wang! Stop it, please! Go away! Ah Wang... Ah Wang, let's go back to the jungle. Ah Wei, don't cry. Come on. Come with me. Ah Wang. Come. Have a drink! The Peking Man has escaped! Hurry and send your men! Let's go! Ah Wang! Ah Wang! Get out of here, quickly! Come here! Follow me inside, move! What's the matter? It's terrible, a giant gorilla's outside! My wife's a gorilla. What?! Who's a gorilla?! Ah Wang! Ah Wang, stop it! Don't do it! Attention. Sir. I know about the Peking Man. I'll try to lure him to Wanchai's construction site. It's less populated there. Get there as fast as you can. I'll be right there. Attention all units, we have to lure the Peking Man to Wanchai's construction site. Send out the armored unit. Wait for my orders. Set up checkpoints at all major intersections. Try to stop him. Your orders are shoot to kill. Yessir. Get everyone on it. Yessir. I've got a way to control him. What's that? There's a girl called Ah Wei. She was raised by the Peking Man. If we can find her We can control the Peking Man. Where's this Ah Wei now? -She has escaped. She's from the jungle. She's dressed in animal skin. She'll be quite easy to spot. -Animal skins, huh? Mr. Chen, thank you for your cooperation. We'll find this girl. This way. Attention all units. We are looking for a girl wearing an animal skins. Her name is Ah Wei. That's her! Come down! They can't get the Peking Man under control. Deploy the helicopters. Concentrate all units here, I need everyone's help here. Destroy the Peking Man. Track it and make sure you don't hurt any civilians. All units are in position. Open fire! We must stop him! Attention everyone! He's climbing up Connaught Centre! He can't be stopped by bullets! Fill up the water tanks on the roof with gasoline and then set up time bombs. We'll blow up the Peking Man. The building will be destroyed too! -Doesn't matter. It is the only option. Fill up the tanks! -Yessir! No! Don't! Ah Wei! Ah Wang! What now? This way! Please, don't shoot! -Don't hurt him! The Peking Man is out of control! If we don't kill him, he'll destroy all of Hong Kong! This is Ah Wei. She was raised by the Peking Man. She can calm him down. Really? -Please, I beg of you, don't hurt him! One condition: You must promise her you won't kill him. I promise. Are you sure? I'll keep my word. All units, cease fire! Repeat: all units, cease fire, now! Ah Wang! Ah Wang, lower your hand! Ah Wang. Let's go back home to the jungle. Ah Wang. Attention all units, the Peking Man's calmed down. Let's seize this opportunity. We must destroy him. We have no choice. Yessir. Stop it! Well done. We must kill him! No! Hurry! Run! The demolition team is standing by and ready for action. Place the bombs and wait for my order. Yessir. You're setting bombs. Your commander promised me you wouldn't hurt the Peking Man once it's in control! We're just following orders. You'll have to speak to the commander. Don't move! There's no use disarming it.
