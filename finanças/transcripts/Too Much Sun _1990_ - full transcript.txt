(BIRDS CHIRPING) (SPRING PLAYING) (DOG WHIMPERING) Oh, boy. Come on, Brandon. Come on. Oh. Yes. (SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY) (SPEAKING GIBBERISH) Excuse me, Bitsy. (ALL CHATTERING) Bye, bye. All right, now. -I love you. -Watch out for your brothers and sisters, okay? Do what the counselor tells you. Capice? -(HONKS HORN) -PoodleLoo Malibu. (BARKS) GEORGE: Sonny. Yes, I love you. (DOGS BARKING) (SPRING PLAYING) -Good morning, sir. -Good morning, Vincent. -Where to, sir? -Confession. Bless me, Father, for I have sinned. Father? Are you in there? Yes. O. M. I didn't ask you here to confess to me. I have a confession to make to you. I'd be honored, Father. Pour your heart out. Oh, God. Oh. That's Susan, my daughter's fiancee. In fact, they might even be married. Oh. I'm sorry about that, Father. What can I do to cleanse my soul? Fifty thousand, and three Hail Mary's. That sounds fair. No, I should pay. It's probably all my fault anyway. You either gave them too much affection or not enough. Or too much allowance or not enough. When it comes to children, you can't express your love through money. When it comes to me, I already have plenty of love. -I just need enough money to spread that love around. -(TEARING PAPER) There you go. Ah. And don't think the Lord is not suspicious of your son. -What's the matter with Sonny? -I'm askin' you. The man is 47 years old and still a bachelor. I've never seen him with a woman. Have you? Well, he certainly loved his mother, and his mother loved him. And Sonny loves women. Unfortunately, so does his sister. I thank you for your generosity. And if you find your son is sick, I'll give him some counsel. And if that doesn't work, we'll get him to a Gay A meeting. Well, thank you, Father. I'm not a bit worried about Sonny. He's as masculine a son as I could have hoped for. Well... Mmm... (TIMER TICKING) (SIGHS) Well... Checkmate. So what? Let's boogie. All right, you mad thing, you. (SULTRY MUSIC PLAYING) How close are we, Fuzby? Ah. Uh, I planted two for the kids. And, uh, I've got 7000 blue gomukes coming in and 3000 Italian bucksaws. And I ordered 50 pounds of human hair to keep the coyotes off. How about that Filipino tree? Ah, the new one? The, uh, corazon bravo? It's on its way. -Perfect. -It grows tall and very lush. It's one of a kind, sir. Trees are your thing, Fuzby. Make it happen. (SULTRY MUSIC PLAYING) -Leave my son alone. -Tell him to leave me alone. It's not always me chasing him, you know. We have a real relationship here, sir, in case you haven't noticed. Well, stand up and be counted. -Sonny, it isn't true, is it? -No, dad. I swear it's not true. He's lying, sir. He pulled my pants down in the pantry when he was 17. All right, it's true. But I wanted to spare you the agony, Dad. I'm afraid I do love George Bianco. (GRUNTS) God, have mercy on my soul. Dad, you'll get over it. It's not like losing a son. -It's like gaining another son. -I can do mouth to mouth. Get away from me. Get away from me. FATHER: I got here soon as I could, O. M. Boy, were you right about my son. Well, someone had to tell you. Now listen, O. M. Before I perform your last rites, I need you to do something for yourself. You name it, Father. I'd like you to eliminate the subtle inequities in your will. What's wrong with the will? Too much earthly reward for two people who don't deserve anything, and a third person, unrelated, who thinks he's Johnny Appleseed. Well, that's what I want to see happen. Uh, a third to Bitsy, a third to Sonny, and a third to Fuzby because he's serious about the environment. (GASPING) Well, we're gonna find a way for the Lord to forgive you, O. M. And it all starts with this new will. What's in the new will that's, uh, not in the old will? Incentive for your children. Goals, structure, discipline. Everything you've failed to give them in life. There we go. O. M. Rivers. Ah. (KISSING) OM: Bitsy, Sonny, Fuzby, come to me. Daddy, I'm here, Daddy. -Kids. Not you two. -Excuse me, Father. You're not part of the family. You're gonna be all right, Daddy. -Everything's gonna be all right. -Uh-huh. We can't afford to lose you, O. M. -The trees need you. -I'm sorry I upset you like this. I apologize for every homosexual experience I've ever had, or ever will have. Please forgive me, Dad. I... I love you. Well, I hope you still love me after you hear the will. Why, have you changed something? Yes, but the change is... Is good. For all of you. Honest. Father Kelly? To whom it may concern. My estate valued at $200 million, coupled with all future profits and assets of Old Man Rivers Industries. Is to be equally divided between my son, Sonny, my daughter, Bitsy, and my environmental advisor, Fuzby Robinson on the following condition. Condition? One or both of my children must bear me a legitimate grandchild within 12 months of my death. If nobody succeeds, all monies go directly to our Lady Queen of Figueroa. Attention Father Seamus Kelly. SONNY: What? -P. S., this child must be conceived in the traditional way. Only through old fashioned lovemaking as so beautifully portrayed in the Bible. Signed O. M. Rivers a. k. a. Dad. -(SOUND OF FLOW OF AIR REDUCING) -(GRUNTING) (GASPING) (LOUDLY EXHALES) BITSY: Daddy? -He's gone. -Thank God he went peacefully. (SOBBING) I suggest there be not a word of this to the press or you'll be inundated with gold diggers who have no conscience and no integrity. He never intended this. I can only tell you what's here in the will. I'll take you to the highest court. And have your dick knocked so far up into your head, your balls will bounce into your larynx and you'll be pissin' out of your toupee. -Give him hell, Bitsy. -(BITSY CRYING) Now, who do you think a jury will believe? A homosexual? A lesbian? Or a man of God? -Which one are you? -(BITSY SOBBING) (UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING) (MUSIC STOPS) Hey, Reed, Reed, will you stop with the food? Rent is due, we gotta go to work, come on. (ENGLISH ACCENT) I don't want you to go to work without a little breaky in you. I made Reality Real Estate salad, it's gonna give drive. I want to get a little world view. -It's gonna give you roughage. -Will you stop with the accent? Drop the accent. People are gonna think your phony, all right. I wanna be an actor, I've gotta have an accents. Accents don't work in real estate, Reed. -Customers, customers. Let's go... -When I become a star... Get the fuck out of here. Come on. Work before we eat, all right? Okay, all right. -Come on, get fucking moving. -I just made that salad. -Enough with the salad. -(GRUNTS) Get up Reed. Reed, up, Reed. Reed, up, you imbecile, get up. Up, good boy. Hey, hey, before you dial, I want you to visualize your customer. I want you to be inspired. I want you to bring home the bacon. Now, come on. You got the picture, numb nuts? You know what's gonna inspire me most? To get that 150 to pay you back, so I can get you outta my life. (LAUGHING) You want your freedom? You earn it. Before I met you, I was ridin' high. Before you met me you were ridin' the fuckin' bus. Dial, baby, dial. -(PHONE RINGING ON OTHER END) -Hello. -Hello, Mr. William Edgar? -No, thanks. Hi, this is Reed Richmond. I'm down at Reality Real Estate in our Calabasas office. -Fuck you, man. -Here it is, right to the top.

I'm gonna bring you in on a murder wrap. Daddy. Who's gonna believe you, deary? You'll believe me when you meet my little baby boy. -What baby's that? -Frank Della Rocca. (LAUGHS) Okay, let's go over here, Daddy. Just... Here... Daddy, Daddy, thank you, Daddy. You've released me from my dark secret. (SPLASH) Oh. -I'll get it. -(SCREAMING) Some water. Oh, that's beautiful, thank you. -Mmm, that's good. No, no, oh, no. -Can I get you... -(NURSE MUMBLING TO BITSY) -(GLASS BREAKS) Uh-oh. FATHER KELLY: Good mornin'. I got here as soon as I could. Had two masses and an escrow closing. -I'm bushed. -Get outta here. You've brought shame to my family. I'm gonna show you and your church cause I have a baby! I'm gonna buy and sell you, you satanic scum! You're havin' an extra spiritual experience. -Go with it. -You go with it. You go with it, you punk. You... Oh. You go with it. Your mother sucks cocks! Big ones! Big ones! Oh, there they are. Suck 'em! (MOANING) There's your mother, suckin' the big one. Suckin' the big one. (WAILING) Would you mind leavin' us alone, Bitsy and I? Of course, us guys will split and leave you guys alone. -Come on, Padre, out. -Forgive me, forgive me. -Come on, Bitsy. -You believe me, don't you Susan? You believe me. Sonny. I'm proud of you, lad. You have plenty of courage and faith. And that's why you're not fallin' apart like your sister. Was she ridiculous with those ashes. Even I was embarrassed and usually nothin' bothers me. Well, can you blame her for cracking up? She's facing a life of poverty. Don't talk about my sister anymore, okay? She's none of your business. Ah, you're a loyal boy, Sonny boy. And if anyone deserves that money more than me, it's you. And your sister. God bless you. Daddy's in heaven with mommy. My little baby Frank, the family tree. -Susan? -Yes. -I love you. -I love you, Bitsy. -Bitsy's got to get well. She's our only hope. -George? -What? -She's not our only hope. -What're you saying? -Well, there's me. -You? -Me and Susan. -You and Susan what? -Me and Susan and baby makes three. You piglet! Your sister's lover? You'd have sex with her. No, I'm not talking to you for as long as I live. I'll be in the car. George, I'm only doing it for us. Favors like that I don't need. I'd rather go live in the streets. Look, what would you do if you were in my place? I'd keep my dick in my pants and come home with George Bianco. Uh, that's me, in case you've forgotten. I'm leaving and you'd better be following me, because if you're not, I'll be in the car... All alone. Bitsy? It's me, Sonny. Everything's gonna be okay, sweetheart. We're all pullin' for you. You just get better and leave everything to me. -Bitsy? -She can't hear a word you're saying. Then this is the perfect opportunity To tell you that I find you deeply attractive Susan. Go on? I wanna make you my princess. I wanna lay you down on the Eames chair and make it all happen. Make what happen? Love. Pregnancy. Babies. Money. You know the equation, sweetness. George is dead asleep at 12:20 without fail. I'll be looking to meet you on the couch at exactly 12:22. What about Bitsy? Well, we're doing it for her. Oh, okay. You're sexy and you're clever and I'm gonna need a lot of help. (GRUNTING) See you later. (MOANING) (SULTRY CLASSICAL MUSIC PLAYING ON TV) 9-7-6-Olay. (KISSING NOISE) Hi. I'm Jill down at Easy Escort. All alone? There's no need for that. Your Easy Escort girl is just a phone call away. FRANK JR: Hey, Reed. I'm in love with this upper right hand corner, huh? Hey, hey, hey, Olaylay, hey. Call 9-7-6-Olay. We deliver when you pickup. 9-7-6-Olay, night or day. Bring money. Hey, hey, hey, Olay. Olay. (KISSES) What'd you say? Hi. 9-7-6-Easy Escort? Yeah, this is Frank Della Rocca, the President of Reality Real Estate. That young woman in the upper right hand corner has had a delicious effect on me. Yeah, I'd like her to escort me to the Southern California Real Estate Convention just getting underway at 1217 and a half Tuxedo Park in Calabasas. Right. Yeah, tell her to ask for Frank, the midnight rambler. Yeah. GEORGE: I'm in a lot of pain, Mr. Rivers. It's called heartache in case you haven't noticed. SONNY: Go to sleep, George. You look terrible. You look puffy. Have you been drinking? GEORGE: You have no sensitivity. I have not missed an AA meeting in six years. You're putting me to sleep George. Oh, now I'm a bore. I didn't say that. Just go to sleep. The only way I'll go to sleep is if you give me two good night kisses. One on each ball. Oh, you're a laugh a decade. George, you're not gonna stop me from doing what has to be done. If you lie down on top of Susan Connor, I'll kick your ass. -Don't forget I was a tight end. -Oh, a tight end? Well, some things certainly have changed. Ha-ha. George, if you could get pregnant, we wouldn't have to do this. Anybody but her, Sonny. Name someone. I don't know. What women do I know? Well, that's my point. How will you ever look your sister in the eye again? I don't enjoy this. It would be absolutely criminal to let Father Kelly walk away with my father's money. But if it's going to turn you into a drooling psychotic I'd be willing to forget the money and go out and get a job. But what would I do all day? So just swallow your pride while I jump on Susan. This is all a nightmare. This is not really happening, so you can leave because this is not really real. Well, there you go. Just go to sleep. Bye, bye, and in the morning it will be all over. At least be a man. What does that mean? Make sure you're on top. I know my way around a woman, okay. For your information, 25 years ago I had an intimate exchange with a Spanish female. Hi. I thought you chickened out on me. Sonny Rivers does not chicken out. So, uh, you wanna go outside under the stars or you wanna, um, just do it on the floor? That's up to you. You are the man. I am the little boy. Boy oh boy, I'm a little, tiny boy. Well, you do look like a little boy, you minx you. (WHISPERING) I'm wearing a skimpy pair of jockey shorts with a roll of quarters inside, just for you, Buster. Oh, very nice. Wanna see what I did for you Susan? Close your eyes. Are you ready? -Voila! -(GASPS) Oh, my God. Get over here. (GASPS) -Tell me what to do. -Lie down on your back. -I'll be right with you. -Uh, no way, I have to be on top or we're not in business. Is this shit what goes on between you and George? What goes on between me and George is none of your affair. Well, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to offend you, Sonny. Or should I say Big Sonny, even though I haven't seen anything yet, Studberry. See you down south. Susan. If I'm gonna be judged, I'm gonna be judged in the dark. (PANTING) That's better. (PANTING) I got you where I want you now, Studberry. Take me, Susan, take me to Paris. (MOANING) It's not working. George usually does something. Wait, I have an idea. (GASPS) Excuse me, Father. Don't interrupt me. I'm in the middle of a fantasy. Yes, Father. And... When you're finished, I have some news about Bitsy Rivers. Mmm. Poor Bitsy Rivers... Took a mighty fall. Thank God she has her faith. Father, do you remember at the funeral when Bitsy started babbling about having a son? Well, I looked up the name Frank Della Rocca and low and behold, there is such a person and he lives right here in the Southland. -That's enough, Sister. -Yes, Father. Call the others. Yes, Father. Sister Ursula, Sister Tina! This... Is all I ever really wanted... Ever. I wanted to be a priest and that came true. And now I want to be a bishop but I really haven't got time to be a bishop. And the only way I can skip bishop and go directly to cardinal is by showing the Vatican my fund raising skills, i.e., the 200 million bucks. No one is going to take that away from me. No one. I will be cardinal and no son of a Bitsy Rivers is going to be my downfall. Sister Ursula, get into our nurse's outfit, and don't forget our squeaky shoes. And Sister Agnes, I want you to slip into our lovely blue dress, get on your bike and ride all night until you take care of business. (OPERA MUSIC PLAYING) (DOOR OPENS) Well? -Well what? -Well, I hope it was awful. Actually, it was fun. FRANK JR: Hey, Reed, you really think I'm gonna score? Course I'm gonna score. I'm just playing with you. Hey, what, what? You don't think I'm gonna score. Get under the bed and watch me, if you don't believe me. Get under there and find yourself a low angle gander. Yeah, watch Frank Della Rocca charm the underpants off that Easy Escort girl. She loves me, she loves me not. She loves me, she loves me not. She loves me... Well, I wouldn't get too excited, Frank. You know, she could be a real bow-wow-wow in person, you know. FRANK JR: Get under the bed. -(SIGHS) (KNOCKING ON DOOR) FRANK JR: Hey, Reed, enjoy the show. Comin'. Hi. -Um... -You're not the one I ordered. You know, there really should be a discount here. I'm serious. All right, forget it. I'm only jokin'. You gotta make a livin' too, right? Come on in. You know sometimes a man has to accept what he can get, you know what I'm sayin'? -(LAUGHING) -Haha, right. Are you Frank Della Rocca? Frank Della Rocca. Reality Real Estate. -Oh -The midnight rambler. Right, well then I'd like to look at some property. And I'd like to look at some of your property. (CHUCKLES POLITELY) Where are you from Frank? What do you mean? Where was I born or where do I live? Uh, no, no, don't answer that. That's a dumb question. Sometimes I can be so fuckin' stupid, it's amazin'. (KNOCKS) Don't move. Frank? The midnight rambler? Hold on a sec. Who the fuck are you? I told you I'm here to look at some real estate. Oh. Now I get it. What a jerk I am. Let me get my number one salesman. -Great. -Don't move. Reed! Reed! Reed. Come on out. We've got a customer. Reed Richmond. Reality Real Estate. -I don't do orgies. -No, no, those two aren't stayin'. -Come on in. -Hey, Reed. Sell the woman some real estate, Reed. Ah, use the other office. Hey show her the back 40, Reed. I'll see ya in the mornin'. Late in the morning. -Okay, well here's the property we've got. -Mmm-hmm... It's a little, uh, simulation of reproduction of a property we represent outside Minsk. So what's your name? No names. Are we gonna get started or would you just like to hold hands? -Whatever you want. -I want the money. Excuse me. One minute. Got it right here. My very special entertainment sock. Two hundred fifty dollars, right? Yeah, I know. Now, I wish it didn't have to be this way. This is your idea, the money. But, uh, I could do it for nothin'. There's a 150. I gotta look around for the other 100. Just hang with me a minute. I got it... I got it. Just it's around here. Let's see. Hey, I gotta go. Hey, hey. Wait, wait, wait. I'm in love with you in case you didn't notice. I mean, I don't even care that you're a 9-7-6 girl. I mean, I don't judge people by their profession. You could be, uh, what, a school teacher I'd still be in love with ya. As a matter of fact, you remind me of one of my teachers. Yeah, hey, come on, I'm in love with you. If you wanna be in love, it's gonna cost you a lot more. Boy, it sounds like your life has been a very long and rough journey, huh? We're here to talk about you, Frank, if you're able to finance it. Hey, could you lend me the $100? How long have you known Frank? Well, he's unknowable, you know, unlike me who's dying to be known. (IN ENGLISH ACCENT) I'm kinda rehearsing for an improv down at the group theater down on Cahuenga. It's about this, like, English teddy boy rocker, and he leaves London because everything's wrong. and there's not enough sun. And, like, he like comes to LA because he thinks he's gonna be great and he hopes to get this great demo. But within a fortnight, it's like everything's all fucked, everything's gone awry, you know. And it all ends up at Pinks which is like great. And it's like kinda of a Joe Orton, like, you know, butt plug kinda fantasy... I'm not done yet because of course it's improvised. Have you ever met Frank's family? -(IN NORMAL VOICE) His family? -Uh-huh. (IN ENGLISH ACCENT) Ain't got no family, all right. I'm his mom. He's got no dad. His brother's all right, but he's not alive. So it's me and Frank and get the fuck outta here. (LAUGHING) Excuse me? Are we gonna have sex or what?

There's nothing I can do to change your mind, huh? Frank, it's been fabulous. Hey, whatever happened to love? I already explained that to you. Listen, I know you're not gonna tell me your name, but, like, when I call, who do I ask for? Gracia. But if I don't get back to you, don't take it personally, or any other way.

Maybe you'd like to be in escrow in Moscow, we can meet over in Berlin, go look at that broken down wall, talk about the future of the universe. Here it is. -(HORN HONKING) -Oh, right. Hey, more customers. -What a day, huh? -Escrow. Escrow. -Hey, what's the matter with you? -She's a woman, boyo. Have sympathy. It's the Real Estate Commission! -Fuck! -Oh, no, they're gonna pull the plug on us. -Fuck me. -I'll cover for you boys. Get under your bed. -(MUTTERING INDISTINCTLY) -Fuck me. REED: Oh, no, they're gonna pull the plug on us. You answer the door, lady. Tell 'em Frank's not here. And, lady, I'm lookin' to get into escrow as soon as possible. -Hello. -Uh... Sorry! Hello, I'm Bitsy Rivers. I'm here to see Frank Della Rocca. Just wait. Ah. Hey. Hey. Hey! Yo, bitch. What the fuck are you... (SCREAMS) -Did you get the blood? -Yes, I got it. -Show it to me. -(PANTING) -Pull Bitsy's medical records and get to the lab. -Mmm-hmm. Find out if her blood type matches with Frank Della Rocca's. Oh, this is exciting. -Goodbye, Sister. -Hello, Father. Get moving. Ah! Oh, God! -Oh, Reed, Reed. -What is it? -Reed, she shot me with heroine. Reed. -Oh, come on. Reed. I'm gettin' dizzy, man. -It's okay. -I can't see. Reed, get out there and get rid of those people and then call an ambulance, man. I'm dyin' in here. (GRUNTING) -Oh, my God. Frank? -No. No Frank here. -Aren't you Frank Della Rocca? -No, Reed Richmond. -I'm sorry. Where is Frank Della Rocca? -I don't know. FATHER KELLY: I got here as soon as I could. He had a brain tumor, he had to leave. That real estate commission's out of control. They stuck me with a shot of heroin, Father. -I'm woozy here. -Woozy or not Frank, you're my man in Russia. Hey, forget business, all right. I'm high, do you mind? I need rehab. Somebody do an intervention, man. I'll do an intervention on you myself. Come on, lad. Come on, Bitsy, let's go. Wait a minute. You're Frank, I know it! You're just being shy. Yeah, well, what's wrong with that? BITSY: George. Sonny. Frank, I'd like you to meet my big brother, Sonny Rivers, and this is his friend, George. And this is your Aunt Susan. Isn't he beautiful, boys? I'm not Frank. Okay? I'm Reed Richmond. Reed Richmond? Where do I know that name from? (IN ENGLISH ACCENT) Well, you know, yeah, I'm still in class actually, a little scene study, over on Cahuenga. Little off-Broadway. He's just covering up, because you're making him nervous. He thinks you're making a pass at him. Me? I'd rather make a pass at you, Bitsy. BITSY: Frank? -Right. -Whoa! -Hey, there, buddy. -Hey, what's up, baby? -Where's Frank? -Never heard of him. You have. You just beeped me. -I have not! -Who just beeped you? Frank Della Rocca and he owes me 250. Is that right, Frank? Listen, I got no money, all right? It's all tied up in war bonds. And it's all gone. No cash. I'm tap city, babe. I'm tap city. Well, honey, I'll take care of it. How much does he owe you? Two fifty. There's 300. Keep the change. -I'm taking this out of your allowance, Frank. -All right. -Thanks, you're a real gentleman. -Thank you. Oh, my goodness, what a gorgeous girl. -That Frank's a lucky puppy. -Thanks, Mom. Now why can't I get to a girl like that. Because you don't need to, Sonny. Frank Della Rocca is here. He's gonna take all our troubles away. -Bitsy. -BITSY: What? -You know you really let me down. -What do you mean, George? You got suckered by a two-bit hustler. I didn't sucker anyone, all right, you fagatini. -What? -You wait a minute, honey, I'm a fagatini too. We're all fagatinis, sweetheart. SONNY: You're the odd one out. Come on, George. It's obvious I have work to do. -Hang tough, Bitsy. -Sonny, you're spinning your wheels. BITSY: Spinning your wheels. -Oh, Nurse Neely. -Yes. How much would you charge for me to get you pregnant? -I couldn't do anything like that, sir. -Why not? I can't say why. -Oh, now look what you've done. -Leave me alone. -Frank! -Or I'll find someone who will. Right. -Frank, Frank? -Yeah. It's time to go home with me and Susan for the rest of your life. -Bitsy, may I have a word with you, please? -Come on now. -Pack your bags. -Yeah. -I think he likes me. -I think he likes your pocketbook, you fool. You'll be sorry you said that, Susan. When I locate his father, Frank Senior, and I marry him and he testifies that this is true. What if he's already married, Bitsy? Well, then he'll divorce his wife after I pay her off and then we'll stay married long enough for me to legitimize baby Frank and then I'll pay him off. And then you and me and Frank, we'll move down to Santa Fe and open up an art gallery. (GRUNTS) (GRUNTS) What's up giblets? If you bring him home, you can say goodbye to me forever. And P.S., give my ass a big kiss. I need a chauffeur, Frank. Are you that chauffer? (IN ENGLISH ACCENT) Listen, I'm the president of me own corporation, right? I can't afford that kind of downgrade. Would 7000 dollars a week be an insult? No. Then get in the car. (LAUGHING) (SPITS) BITSY: Oh, all right. Right there. Ease it in. Yes. (DOGS BARKING) Whoo. -I'm on to you. -Excuse me! You're the most handsome chauffer I've ever had. Thanks, mom, you're very attractive yourself. Hey, you. Wait up! (LAUGHING) Sure. -All this is yours, Frankie. -Oh, this is great, you know. I just feel like I'm comin' home, you know. -You are home. -Sure. -You're my baby. -Whoo! -BITSY: Oh, come to mama. -(FRANK YELLING) Oh, he's my baby. Oh. I love him, I love him. You know, Father, you are sporting a very nice piece. -What's a piece? -You know, a toupee. I'm not wearing a toupee. Is it a weave. It's a good one. Frank. Don't be projecting your fear of baldness onto my head. What you see here is 100 percent natural. Get outta here. I know a rug when I see one. Besides, there's nothing wrong with wearing a toupee. Shut up! SONNY: Oh. Oh, yeah. (WOMAN IN SPANISH ACCENT) Take me, gringo man. I'm ready. SONNY: Oh, yes. I want you to have my baby. Does your boyfriend have to watch us? -Watch what? We haven't done anything yet. -Yes, but you know. I'm beginning to feel in the mood to do nasty, and how do you say, do wild things to your body, gringo man. -Yes. -Oh. -George, stop looking at us. -(MOANING) In fact go get the blanket and put it on the sand. SONNY: Come on, let's do it. Come on, let's get in the sand. (WOMAN SQUEALING) George, open the door. I'm coming out. -Yes, let's go. Yes. -(WOMAN SQUEALING) (GRUNTING) (ALL GRUNTING) -Ah. -WOMAN: Hey! There's a cramp in my leg. It's no use. There is no way you could have me tonight. (GRUNTS) -I can't fuck you like this. -We've blown it again, Sonny. Bitsy doesn't have a son and you can't make a kid. -Who are we kidding? We're finished. -Ah, you're right. We're finished. Well, let's look on the bright side. I mean, come on. We have our memories, don't we? We were couple of the year at the racquet club in '79. Hey, just take me home, okay? -(KNOCKING ON DOOR) -Frankie, it's Mommy. Did I come at a bad time, honey? Well, get your PJs on and I'll be back in a few minutes. Toupee or not toupee, that really is the question. Have a seat. Let's play land deal, boyo. You got all the answers, don't you? Come on, Father, let's get down to it. I'm tired of waitin' here. Hang on to your seat, Frank. You just hang on to that magic carpet of yours, all right? (THUD) (BLOWS) (BELLS TOLLING) (CHUCKLING) You people got a strange way of doing business. You think a little piece of nothing is gonna hold Frank Della Rocca back? -(DOORBELL RINGS) -(SCOFFS) -The door. -Oh. Uh, may I help you? -(IN DEEP VOICE) Blood test. -(SIGHS) -Uh, how much is that? -My boss says there's no charge for the church, but he wouldn't mind if you remembered him in your prayers. Oh, bless you. -Nighty, night. -Good night. Negative. -It's all negative, Aggie. -(LAUGHS) Frank, there are only five people in the world I can tolerate, and you're not one of them. You're shutting me out just because of the toupee thing? That is sad. (BARKING) Oh, yeah. Yeah, you like a little of that. -Get a little in there, just... -BITSY: Frankie? -Mommy's here to tuck you in. -Oh, all right! -Sure. -Come on. Get under there. -There. You all cuddled up now? -Sure. (INDISTINCT MURMURING) Oh, you look so pretty, if you weren't my mother I'd, I'd ask you to marry me. Oh, Frank, I always knew you were gonna be sensitive. I'm gonna get you out of L.A. in a hurry, so you can flourish and grow. Mommy's very proud of you, Frank. I'm proud of you too, Ma. I'm proud of how rich you are. How'd you do it? Hard work and a lot of money, Frank. But now that you're here, I'm only gonna concentrate on you. You're my baby. You're my little Frank. Oh, sweetheart, 22 years ago I made the biggest mistake of my life. But if you forgive me, I promise I'll be the best mother you ever had. Okay. Enough of this. We have the rest of our life to talk, don't we? -Sure. -Why don't you turn off the light? Close your eyes. Mommy's gonna sing you a lullaby. She's hired this guy to be the new chauffeur. Why'd she have to pick such a creep? He looks like a low budget Tony Curtis.

I'd like you to mind your own business about how I am raising my child, if you don't mind. Raising your child? There is a difference between a child and an imbecile, and Reed Richmond, who that chump is, is as dumb as they come. (YELPS) (GASPS) (GRUNTING) Oh. -Think they're hurting each other? -Nah. -(SCREAMING) -Bitch! You Albanian bitch! (MUFFLED SHOUTS) Oh, my God, Susan. You can't swim. Oh! Oh! I'm coming, baby!

(CHUCKLING) (PHONE RINGS) (SNORTING) (HAWKING) -Hello. -SUSAN: Is this Frank Della Rocca? -Yeah. Who wants to know? - Me. So, who are you? Someone who wants to offer you a job that will take no longer than two hours. -Cash? - Yeah, nothing but. (CHUCKLES) You're my sweetheart. Hey, Reed! Reed! Reed! Can you beep her? Sure you can. Excuse me sir, where would you like to meet my little sister? George, would it bother you if I said I'm gonna fuck this man's sister out on the boat? You never take me on the boat. (CELL PHONE RINGING) Hello? Thanks. You know, Gracia, someday I'm gonna take you away from all of this. Yeah. FATHER KELLY: That's it, Sister, rub the snakes out of me. (GIGGLING) That's it, Sister. -Rub all the little snakes out. -(CHUCKLING) I am so rich and so happy. Roll out the red carpet for Cardinal Kelly. Hello, Roma. (LAUGHS) Sister Agnes, Father Kelly! Bitsy Rivers is getting married to Frank Della Rocca Sr. The wedding's at 5:30. They found the father of Bitsy Rivers' son. All right, Agnes. Let's move it. -Don't we know this bimbo? -Gracia. -Sonny, this is my sister, Gracia. -You're absolutely gorgeous. I'm Sonny Rivers and I wanna offer you a job, the financial compensation, for which will be very, very substantial, I'm talking seven figures. I'm a very gentle person, I'm very clean, and I'm not gonna hurt you. I respect you as a virgin and you can bring your brother along to watch. So I can be your agent as well as your brother. It's good. Listen, seven figures or not, I'm gonna need an AIDS test. Then go get one. Show him your card. Nice picture. I just got mine updated. SONNY: Very pretty. Stay. GEORGE: Sonny! I'll be here waiting! I'll be right here! Why do you want to pay me so much money to sleep with you? Not just sleep with me, sweetheart. I want you to be the mother of my baby. What if you don't get me pregnant? Well, if I do, I'll give you two million dollars. Gracia? Are you a virgin? (SCOFFS) Absolutely not. Is my driver your brother? 'Course not. Are you a female prostitute? Yes I am, but I made everybody else wear rubbers, so you have nothing to worry about. For some reason, I trust you implicitly. Oh... Hello, girls. I'm the bride. I need something off beat to relax the guests. How about some speed metal? Zydeco? How about, Someday My Prince Will Come? Listen girls, this is a small wedding. I don't have many friends. Please help me out. I need something with a full sound. A salsa? -Yeah. -Hit it. (BAND PLAYS SALSA MUSIC) Hey! Hey. Hey pal, can you get me out of this chair? Wait. Hey, wait. You're not from that Real Estate commission, are you? No. I'm from the Broken Heart's commission. I'm the president. Hey, pal, give me a break, huh? Oh, hell, if he's behaving like a whore, I guess I can too. Do you find me attractive? Get the fuck outta here. (GASPING) (BED SQUEAKING) Did I cum? I don't think so. Listen, for seven figures I'll stay until the coast guard comes. Thank you. (SIGHS) (HORNS BLARE) Don't I know you from the Actor's Lab? That's right. Yeah. Been to any good auditions lately? So, what brings you to the Marina? Looking for that rat bastard, Reed Richmond. I know that name. Yeah, Reality Real Estate. He's my ex-partner. -Oh. Speaking of ex-partners... -Get your hands off me, pal. My ex-partner, Sonny Rivers, is out there on that boat having sex with your ex-partner's sister, Gracia. Gracia? (CHUCKLES) Gracia ain't his sister. She's my fiance. Well, then, you better be a man and swim out there and put a stop to this. No sense me getting jealous. Why not? 'Cause, she's a hooker. She's a hooker. I might as well face it. The future mother of my children's a straight out slut. Easy escort whore. I got no reason to live. (SCREAMS) Gay shark approaching. (SIGHS) It's no good. It's just not happening. You're very sweet, Sonny, but you're just not into women. Mmm-mmm. What's the name of your boyfriend? Who? George! Get out. (SPLASHES) Have you ever been to the Royal Academy. -No, where's that? -Santa Monica. Frank Della Rocca? I'm Father Kelly. Is that good or bad, man? So, you're on your way to be married to the woman who claims to be the mother of the child that's said to be your son? FRANK: Frank Della Rocca is my son and as far as I'm concerned, she's the mother. KELLY: Who? Bitty... -Or somebody. -Bitsy Rivers. Oh. I have the results of the blood test that proves that Frank Della Rocca Jr. isn't the son of Bitsy. So, whatever money she promised you is gone my boy-o... In the wind like Mariah. -Then what is it you want of me, pal? -Don't say I do to her and see what I do for you. So, I'm waiting. Fifty dollars cash. -Can I have it now, Father? -KELLY: Sure you can. Twenty five now and twenty five later. Get in, Frank, we have work to do. -Is that our Bitty? -You should be so lucky. (WHISTLING) Hey, what kind of deal you trying to cut me out of, huh? One day you're my partner, the next day you stab me in the back. Hey, gringo. You stole my woman, now you got a cushy job? Well I got a job, all right? When are you going to do something with your life? Give me that 150, then maybe I could do something with my life. -Why don't you sit down? -Fuck you Reed. -Fuck off. -Hey, give me that 150. One-fifty! Hey, Reed! Reed! (BAND PLAYS SALSA MUSIC) Doors to the right gentleman. Sonny, George. Any luck? Another failure. Let's face it, Susan. We're broke. -Maybe Frank Della Rocca. -Oh, he's a sham. What is this? Urgent? -(BREATHING HEAVILY) -Mom? -Frank. There you are. -Hi. Mom, I'd like you to meet Gracia. Gracia this is my mother. Hi. Where have you been darling? Mom, you look beautiful. Mom, listen. Uncle Sonny, he owes Gracia two million dollars. I was wondering if you could cover it for him. Why don't we discuss it when your father gets here. (BRAKES SQUEALING) -Frank. -Yeah. Get in there and bring Bitsy Rivers to her senses. I'll be in in a minute. Get moving. -Oh, uh, don't forget my 25 bucks. -Yeah, yeah. (INDISTINCT VOICE FROM TAPE) (GRUNTS) No fucking bell. These people who don't have bells. (BAND PLAYS SALSA MUSIC) (WHOOPS) Hi. -Frank? -(SIGHS) Frank? Yeah? Frank Della Rocca, Sr.? Yeah, that's me. Who are you? Bitsy. (LAUGHS) -Bitty Rivers? -That's me. (LAUGHS) -Hey! -Oh. Oh. Oh, wow. I dig it baby. I dig it. Where do I know you from? Uh, wait a minute. I know. I know you. Uh... But from where? Uh. Come on what's the scoop? Huh? Lay it on me baby. My sweet 16 slumber party. Wow. Refresh my memory a little sweetheart. I can feel the weight of your red bikini on my head already. (WHISPERS) Blood test. KELLY: This is not what I want to see. This is some bullshit. You were a valet parker, do you remember? Remember that Frank? We have a son, conceived in the garage. I put him up for adoption Frank, but I never put him out of my heart. And now I found him. I need you to make an honest woman out of me, Frank. That's lovely, Bitty. You know, for 75 bucks, I could do anything you want and you better hurry, because see I got a white collar biting at my heels. And I ain't even Catholic. Hi, Mom. -Darling. -Hi. Say hello to your father. -How you doing, Dad? -Son. It's a great day. I got here as soon as I could. What are you doing in my house? -Who asked you to this wedding? -Well, I came to collect 200 million, for Our Lady Queen of Figueroa. Two hundred million? Oh. -(GRUNTS) -Fuzby. It's time to pronounce me and Frank Della Rocca husband and wife. Frank Della Rocca, Jr. is not any son of yours or hers or versa visa. Pass the blood test. Negative boy-o. REED: No, no. Come on. Get out of here. -Hold on. -I'm in the middle of a deal. It's all unraveling. You and I have unfinished business here. -No, no. -BITSY: Is there a problem? Mom, don't pay attention to a word he says. -He's a con man. -Would you like me to have him tossed out on his chair, honey? I'm about ready to toss all of you out. You, I'll take you to the highest court in the land. I'll have your dick knocked so far up into your head, you'll be pissing out of your toupee. Very well said darling. -Who are you? -Mom. Mom! Never mind about him, Bitsy. You're finished. There's nothing left to say, except, -&quot;Tough luck.&quot; -(LAUGHS) The tough luck is yours, Kelly. Nothing can save you now, Sonny. Don't even waste my time, boy-o. I have a cassette here of an excerpt from a book sent to me by a publishing company for my approval before going to press.
