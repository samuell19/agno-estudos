It belongs to the owner, now in Paris. He left to serve as the ambassador to France. People envy his magnificent house, his family, and everything else. But I have nothing for others to envy. Mary, she just plays, eats and lazes around. The 20-year-old girl next to her, with nothing to do but nap and flick through magazines, is me. Am I the ambassador's daughter, you ask? In truth, when I dropped out of school and came here, I had dreams of being taken along to Paris. But one way or another, I ended up in this boredom. Yet I am not the only one who is bored. This lady, always quiet with the same expression on her face, constantly at her needlework, is the ambassador's wife. Why didn't she go with him to Paris? The eldest daughter, she... She suffers from a disease with a very hard-to-remember name. Because of her, Paris was taken away from both me and madam, and this tiresome life became all the more tedious. But there are moments of excitement from time to time. Good afternoon. A package arrived this morning from Paris. Please pass on my good wishes to the lady of the house. You're off already? But you came all this way. I just stopped by during my lunch break, so I'd best be off. I wonder what's inside? Makeup? Clothes? Books? Miss, whose coal have you been using lately? We buy sampyo. Yukpyo is supposed to be better than sampyo. More like a piece of shit than a piece of coal though. Falls apart when I pick it up, goes out when I light it... Gosh! A dress! Fuchsia, my favorite color. Oh my! Oh my! Oh my! It's the new season's raincoat. Does papa think I've fully recovered or something? Just give it away. Who should we give it to? How about rami? Rami had one made last year. Well, how about Mira's mother? Would Mira's mother like such a color? Then who should we give it to? - Wait, will you try this on? - Yes? Yes! Well, keep it and wear it when you go to the market. I hate the sun. How did it chase all the clouds away one by one? It just isn't fair. The weather forecast used to get it wrong sometimes, but how is it so spot on these days? Dear listeners, now for this week's forecast the warm weather will hold out until Friday, but from Saturday we'll see clouds forming, with the monsoon season arriving on Sunday. Really? Now for our next song from today's show. Rain! Rain! Rain! Rain! Rain! You ask if I'm happy? If I like it? So much I could die? Rain! Rain! No one knows how I'm feeling. They couldn't begin to imagine. I came up with an excuse to leave the house. I've finished running the errand, but my feet won't take me back home. In this raincoat my legs look and feel too fresh to go home now. Oh? Do you think it was a handout? No, it looks brand new. Wearing that coat, she thinks she's something special. Why? She's got the same eyes, nose and mouth as us. I know, right? Why don't you take a seat here? Go and throw out your line. Do you think she'll bite? - With those lips, I think so. - Is that so? I'll bet everything I have on it. - Miss Lee? - Miss park? Miss Kim? Miss "no thank you"! Sorry, I'm late. Are you angry? As an apology... You're not hurt anywhere? - This is your first time here, no? - Yes you probably came thinking this was a classical music hall efxcuse me? Ah yes. Why don't I take you some place where they play classical music? I'd better be going. Miss, wait a minute! I'm a very responsible guy, you see. Those guys might still be hanging about, so I'd like to see you home safely. It just so happens that I have my car today. Is this how you always seduce women? You're very straightforward. If this doesn't work, I'll try something else. If I've taken your fancy, would you let me drive you home? - Where abouts do you live? - In the jangchung area. - Just as I expected. - Do you go to the music hall often? Occasionally, when I have the time. Who's your favorite composer? Uh tchai oh, tchaikovsky! I like him too. Does a tchaikovsky fan go around beating people up like that? Oh, you didn't know? They say tchaikvosky poisoned himself because of a beautiful girl. Nonsense! - What a lovely car. - It's a bit outdated now. The car my father bought last month, now that really is sleek. Oh, I'm sorry. What's the matter? I thought you were just a driver. That's a knock. Have you heard of geukdong corporation? - My father is the president. - I see. What does your father do? â€œWell - let's see... does he run his own company? - No_ - A member of the national assembly? - No_ - A cabinet minister? - No_ What's your phone number? I'm not allowed to receive phone calls from friends at the house. You have a very conservative family. Yes, it's suffocating even. I'm intrigued. You can let me out here. - Is this your house? - No_ It's the white marble house over there. Your father is ambassador Kim taegeun? I didn't realize. Please forgive my rudeness. Ambassador Kim's daughter, I had no idea sorry. Thank you. Take care. Wait! Miss Kim, when can we see each other again? If it's meant to be, we'll meet again. No, you must let me see you again. I really mean it. If you don't say you'll meet me again, I'll go on hunger strike outside this house. Goodness. When shall we meet? Tomorrow? The day after? If you insist, let's meet when it next rains. But where? You decide. In the square in front of city hall. At what time? I have no idea what's happening. This raincoat, it turned me into the ambassador's daughter. I have become miss Kim. The French ambassador's daughter. The French ambassador's daughter's lover. Father in heaven, what should I do? With this raincoat, my life is transforming before me. What what should I do? Is this a piece of coal or a piece of shit? Falls apart when I pick it up, goes out when I light it... I've been tricked into buying a fake. Excuse me, you with the car! Don't you think parking your car in front of someone's store could hurt their business? I'm sorry. Please forgive me. I'm just a little excited. I didn't realize please forgive me. I'm sorry. I really am sorry. Please forgive me. Poor man. Looks like a normal guy on the outside. Listen here you crazed fool, I told you to have it fixed in thirty minutes, and you take it for a joyride? What am I supposed to tell the owner? You crazy son of a bitch! How many times is it now? How many times? Eh? I'l fix it and give it back, what's the issue? What did you just say? Mister, I'm begging you. Lower your blood pressure, just for today. This feeling! What I'm feeling right now... I'm not in the kind of savage mood to fight with you right now. I'm the best mechanic you have, but if you rub me the wrong way, it'll be your fortune that suffers. Oi you, you bastard! You too, have you taken rat poison or something? You've been yawning and nodding off all day. How are you going to learn anything like that, punk? Listen son, when I was your age that wasn't my attitude. But now you're nothing more than the boss of a lowlife like me. What, what did you just say? You punk, what did you just say? Son of a bitch! And you, what were you going on about? If you've done wrong, you should own up and beg for forgiveness. But here you are going on about your "mood". You punk. - Why you! - Love is truly beautiful. Has he lost his mind? Move out of the way. - What? You! You punk! - I'm hard at work, move out the way! Hey you! Oi you! You bastard! - I'll tell you! - You got her? You even need to ask? - The French... - Does she have blue eyes? - The ambassador's daughter. - The ambassador? A girl like that with a guy like you? Hey! I can't go on living like this. I shouldn't be washing cars, I should be having my car washed. Do you get it now, you bastard? Do you? - Yes. - You've got it now? What's gotten into you? Have you forgotten? Our promise to have one last parting dance. Isn't it a little soon to be parting? You'll need me until you graduate university. Do you think that third-rate university is going to get me anywhere? Being with me did you no harm, right? Of course not. You gave me clothes, food, cigarettes. - And... - I gave you something somewhat like love. Wasn't your love the one thing I didn't ask for? What are you going after now? A rainbow hanging in the bright and splendid sky. - What if you can't get it? - T will and when I do, I'll return what I owe you, plus interest. Well then, adieu! Wait. If you fall trying to catch it, and get bloodied up, don't hesitate to return to me. I'll be waiting here with the medicine. You're a good woman, but that doesn't mean I want you to wait for me. Adieu. Hello, is this the weather station? Rain, rain! I'm asking you when it's going to rain! It won't rain tomorrow either? And it'll be cloudy the day after tomorrow? Excuse me? You're saying it's raining right now? Mary, they said it's raining. It's raining. Mary! It's raining! Rain! You bastard, it's raining. It's raining, so what? What's up with you? It's raining! It's raining. - 0i, lend me some money. - Money? - Money! - You think I have money? You punk. - You bastard! - Give me back the money I lent you. Come on. I don't have any money to lend you. I need a new suit, shirt, tie... I'm in trouble, money, money! - Hi. - Hey. Hi - Hi. - Hello. - Lend me some money, it's urgent. - I don't have any. Don't be like that what for? For a once-in-a-lifetime business opportunity. When will you pay me back? When your future husband kicks you out. You'd better! I don't think I have any. Help me out. It's all an investment in my love life. Do you like her? - Honestly, I think I've fallen for her. - I'll lend you some then. If you tell me I'm your favorite girl in the whole world. Hey, that's an act of violence. Hurry up. You, you're mean. They'll be back for the suit tomorrow. I need it tonight without fail. Never mind! And don't get it dirty! Don't worry! Here you are. Here. - What do you think? Pretty good, eh? - Yeah. Pretty good-looking I'd say. Okay, I'll be off then! How do you do? Please. The more I waited, the more it didn't rain. This is the first time in my life I've wanted it to rain so much. Goodness, why? You didn't? No, not really. But you remembered to meet me at 2 pm the next rainy day. Why are you laughing? - You don't find it funny? - Find what funny? Here. Where did this come from? Where did it come from? From a tree, of course. Get him! That's a foul, a foul! Bite him, bite him! Bite him! Hit him in the chest, the chest! Hit the chest, the chest! - Hey! - Sorry, sorry! Who do you think will win? - The fat one. - No, the tall one. Gosh! Shall we bet on it? - If the tall one wins, we get to meet again. - Okay! If the fat one wins, you bow on your knees every time we meet. It really suits you. - Not the most handsome man but... - Sure is a lively looker? By the way, I think there's something we forgot. What's that? We still don't know each other's names. Oh, you're right. - My name is very famous. - Really? It's written in the Korean language books. Korean language books? They're used in the first year of school. I know! Baduk? Efxcuse me? There's a fellow who baduk likes, right? Oh, cheol, cheolsu! Come to think of it, you can find my name there too! - Is it yeonghui? - Yes! Well, we've been destined since we were children! Yeonghui, yeonghui, come play with me. Cheolsu, cheolsu, play with baduk. What's that sound? It's a puncture, a puncture. Raise it a bit higher. A bit higher. A little more. That's enough. I said that's enough. Pass me that hammer. Pass it here. - Goodness. - I think the transmission has blown. I don't think I'll be able to get it to start. What's so funny? Goddammit, I need to get rid of this pile of junk. Why didn't you bring your driver? - I thought it would ruin the mood. - Excuse me? What to do? My mother will punish me if I'm home late. If you get in trouble, I'll tell her it's my fault. - I can introduce myself while I'm at it. - That won't do. My mother is extremely old-fashioned. This isn't good. Hey! You jackass! Sons of bitches! A car's coming. Over here! But what will you do? If I run over and make a call, my driver will come. - Here's some money to get you home. - I don't need this much. Is this the time to be arguing over money? Here. - Adieu. - Adieu. - Where will we meet next? - At janchung park, - the next time it rains! - Okay. Goodness. I only have 200 won left. With the car like that, what am I going to do? The owner is going to blow his top. The fire went out again. You don't need to tell me that it might be the old stove, rather than the coal nonsense. I've used this stove for two years, you think I wouldn't know? The coal's fake. I bought it thinking it was the real thing. You know, the world these days has a lot of fakes passing themselves off as the real thing. - The shopping basket I left here at lunch... - It's inside. - And miss? - Yes? Our washing girl samsun ran off. Why's that? Well, the wind blew from the east or the west, and she got carried away and rode off with some guy. You must be looking for someone to replace her. Yes. The work is really piling up. You think I could do all this myself? Find me a nice, strong girl. I'l ask around. He's back! He's back. He's back. - He's back? - What the It's being towed? I'll kill that son of a bitch. What is that? I'm asking you, what's that? I don't believe it The rain doesn't come when you tell it to. Hello! Dammit! Rain? It's rain! Hey, punk! It's raining, rain, dammit! You'll get carried away in a flood at this rate. You bastard, it's raining. I said it's raining! Damn it! Stop that useless talk and listen to me. Are you planning on taking one of the cars again? Naturally! It'll be your goddamn neck on the line this time. Last time you wrecked the car, remember? Who cares! Why would I waste my life at this goddamn garage? Just leave the worrying to me. How about you play my driver tomorrow? Do you think I can live up to the task? Of course! I'll pay you, too. As for the car... I have a reputation to think of. Take the newest model and meet me at 2 pm sharp. - Jangchung park. - Losing your marbles now, are you? Be there tomorrow. I'm going to round up some cash. See you! You've done a lot of washing. Yes, twelve items. Samsun wasn't even half as fast but what are you going to spend all that money on? Are you getting married? It's not that I took samsun's place, working every night. I need money. I get 5 won per item, so 50 won for ten items. If I wash 160 items, I can buy him an expensive dress shirt. Everything is so expensive. But the money he gave me for the way home and my earnings from the laundry shop were enough to buy him a dress shirt I want to buy him underwear and socks as well I want to wrap his whole body with my gifts. That's how I feel Pass me some change, it's for a good cause. Lately I feel scared whenever I see you. It's always about money with you. Less talk, more money. Come on. We're broke. - Then I'll take this dictionary. - No! Two days and you'll have it back. With interest! Only this one time... I don't have anything. Not today. Then give me something else. This pipe is all I have. Where is it from? - Italy. - I'u take it! - Thanks! - Hey! Hey, what do you have? Nothing but my bus fare, sadly. Then what about this ring? Sure, it's yours. Is it real? As real as steel gets. What the cheol! Who said that? Why don't you come here anymore? Sorry, I'm seeing someone. So it's true. Who is it this time? Someone prettier and richer than you. Nice catch! Can I borrow something? Are you serious? You're in love? I've never felt this way before, honestly. Alright, I'll lend you some. But I don't have any cash. Take my watch. And some bum gave me this an hour ago. You have it. Thank you. In return.. - Just one... - Of course. Wait. Not on the lips, here. Hurry up. You can keep it. Go on. See, this is why I liked you. Can I get 7,000 won, please? Fresh 500 won bills, if you can. Looks like you got your hands on other people's stuff. - That's right. - At least you're honest about it. Shouldn't I take this to the police, then? What? No need. Even with those spectacles, you can't tell people apart? I don't have time for this. Hurry up! Hi! Hello! Not good enough. How do you do? We can do better. Comment allez-vous? Comment allez-vous? Comment ca va? Comment ca va? Hmm, well. You bastard! Comment ca va? Comment ca va? Didn't you get in trouble for coming back late last time? Oh, no. - I fell ill. - Did you? It was a dream. Oh, come on. - Let's go. - No car this time? My car is too old. I told the driver to pick us up. There he comes. Sir! It's rolling! Hey driver, couldn't you find a better car? I waited all day, but this was the only sedan. Can you even call this a car? Get out of there now! But I was going to be your driver all day... You. This will have to do. Have a seat. Make yourself at home. Driver, get out. Are you taking the wheel yourself? You're done for the day. Didn't you say you'd pay me? Bringing this wreck of a car and still asking for money... Then we have a problem. Hey, mister jerk-boss! Mister jerk-boss! When I get back, you're dead. Drive safely, sir. Strange fellow, this driver, don't you think? He doesn't have much between the ears. After he got dumped earlier this year, he took rat poison. Now he's a bit dim_ Oh, yeonghui, I got you something. - It's in the bag. - What is it? Open it up, you'll see. If I want to be with you, do I have to start smoking? No, no. That's not it. The thing wrapped in blue. - I didn't know if you'd like it. - Oh my. Why did you buy me something so expensive? Do you like it? - Go number seven! - Go number four, go, go! - Do you think number four will win? - No, number seven. - Do you want to bet? - What's at stake? - If I win, I get a kiss. - Oh behave! Take off those gloves. - Just so I can read your palms. - No thanks. - Are you scared of being touched? - I hate my hands. It's normal that they get tough from playing the piano. I don't want to. This is very new to me. - Haven't you seen the movies? - I have. But I always closed my eyes during those scenes. Well, I can teach you. And who did you learn it from? Me? From my mother. What nonsense what? Let's do it how they do in the movies. First, close your eyes, as if you're dreaming. Then, the man says something like this. What does he say? Yeong, yeong, I love you. - I want to marry you, yeong. - What? Will you marry me, yeong? Tell me. If you say nothing, I'll take it as a yes. Okay? We'll get married and go to France. We still have a lot to learn. I know I'm lacking in many ways. One day, I'll tell you what kind of person I am. But I've changed a lot sincel met you. I've done some hard thinking too. What's wrong? I can't marry you. Why not? Do you love someone else? Oh, I get it. It's the same for me, but let's get married anyway. We'll convince our parents afterwards. That's how it's done. I want to swear by those words, with my honest lips against your honest cheek. What kind of house do you want to live in? How about you? An enormous concrete building. And you? I'm happy with a small place, as long as there's sunlight. I want my life to be real, not for show. What about the furniture? Everything can be old and cheap, except for one thing. What's that? - The tableware. - Tableware? Don't you want me to cook you tasty meals? Strange things catch a woman's fancy. That's something only women know. Tableware looks so beautiful laid out in the kitchen. Rain! It's raining for us! Isn't that a beautiful house? Yes we'll spend our honeymoon in that house. I hope the moon is out that day. No, it would be fine even if it rains. And after our honeymoon? The year after, and the year after that, we'll escape the stuffy city and come back. And what will we do? I'll fish from that cliff over there. And me? - By then you'll probably have a bump. - A bump? A baby! You'll be in that valley over there, washing diapers. Who says? You're already thinking about lazing around. I can do the cooking. I'll make an amazing meal with the fish you catch. Okay, I can't wait to try it. If you buy me a tableware set, I'll cook for you. I will! You're the best! Did your fire go out again? Where have you been? Did you go to the pictures with your money? Here, have a flower. What kind of flower is this? Isn't it a Lily? I had to wait all my life for someone to give me a flower. - It smells nice too. - Where is my basket? It's inside. What happened to your nice umbrella? I lost it you better keep your eyes open. These days people try to steal from right under your nose. How did you lose it? I closed my eyes, because it felt like a dream. Give it! Give it to me! Come on, give it now! No! If they fire you, I'll be all alone here! Cut the crap. If they want to fire me, let them. I don't want to yawn my life away. - Give it! - T don't have it! - Where is it? - I said I don't have it! Do you really want to get fired? I'm going to tell on you. You're completely insane! Are you trying to steal another car? You said that if you got behind the wheel again, I could fire you, right? Isn't that what you said? Sure, put my head on the chopping block. In return, I'll take this car. What?! You bastard! Want to see me go belly-up, do you? Later, I'll come back with my own car. - And I'll give you a big tip. - What did you say? You bastard! That that little out of his goddamn mind. When loneliness trickles down into his heart The traveler, nowhere to go, loses his dreams he cries, soaked in rain he was so in love he was so /n love The rain sobs with him who can't forget his pain I wasn't expecting you here. I wanted to see you. Doing okay? They say you're seeing a lot of her. This time it's kind of real so with me it wasn't? Let's forget about that. I have a favor to ask. I need to buy something. But I'm out of money. Do you really love her? I think so. I thought one day you would come back to me. I still could. But then I can't make my dreams come true. So you were leeching off me all those years? I promised to pay you back in cash. And the things you can't pay back in cash? What do you mean? My heartache right now. You're acting like a child. You'll have to make me feel better. Let's see some blood. As much blood as you drew from me. Are you serious? You know me. Alright, if it's a way to apologise, I'll bleed for you. But at least give me money for the hospital bills. Deal What do they think they're doing? This should be enough, no? Yeong, yeong. I've lost a lot of blood now. If this is close enough, keep your promise. No matter how much you bleed, it won't come close to my heartache. And I'll take this sweater I bought for you. I dressed up. I washed clothes all night, so I could buy a cookbook. Did he find out? Did he? God, I'm ready to confess and be punished. Do whatever you wish, whatever you wish. But please make him come, god. Off-1/mits Yeong! Yeong! I've circled the tree 200 times and thrown 100 stones into the stream, but he's still not here. That's why I'm crying. Yeong! Yeong! Yeong! Yeong! Cheol! - Come out. - I can't right now. - Where were you earlier? - I'm sorry, I broke my promise. What happened? I was on my way, but... You look injured. You must be in pain. Go down. Your arms must hurt As long as you're here, I won't, even if my arms break. Let's go back to the house tomorrow. Rain or shine. Let's have a good time together, like we promised. Yeong, you trust me, right? Will you trust me and come with me to that faraway place? I will what if there's a flood and we can't come back? I'll still go with you. Whatever happens, I'll be strong and follow you. Yeong, listen, and close your eyes. Slowly, very slowly, come closer. Okay. Yeonghui is ready and waiting for me at the house. I need 15,000 won to buy her a tableware set 15,000 won, 15,000 won, 15000 won. Newspapers! Newspapers! The evening edition! Get your newspaper! Newspapers, get yours here! - Thief! - Thief! Cheol! Kill him, kill him! Kill him, kill him! Money, money! Money! Kill him, kill him! Kill him, kill him! Money! Money! Money! Hold him! Yeong! Yeong, look! Cheol! Cheol! Cheol! Cheol, what happened this time? Cheol, tell me. Forgive me, yeong, please. I wanted to tell you the truth at some point. But when I look into your bright eyes filled only with truth, I can't hide it any longer. Forgive me. I couldn't yawn my life away. I wanted to be successful I was fighting so hard for it and then I met you. And I risked everything for you. But I can't even buy you the tableware set I promised. I've become a worn out good-for-nothing. Yeong, do you hear what I'm saying? Yeong, I don't drive a sedan. I don't know anything about tchaikovsky or drink 50 won coffees. I'm not from a wealthy family. Actually, I wash wealthy people's cars. I struggled to get by at a third-rate university. Yeong, forgive me. I'm just a mechanic, making 70 won a day. Yeong, will you forgive me? Will you forgive me? Please forgive me! Cheol! Cheol! What do you want me to do? What about me? I'm not an ambassador's daughter either. Why didn't you tell me before? Why didn't you tell me? I'm a maid, working in their kitchen. I'm a maid. Why didn't you tell me? Why! Because of this because of this! Why didn't you tell me? Why didn't you tell me? Why didn't you tell me? Why didn't you? Why! Why! I didn't want to lose you! I lied because I wanted you to be mine! I wanted you to be mine. A piece of human garbage! Take me! This human garbage! Yeong! Forgive me. You have to forgive me. Yeong! I'm a good-for-nothing who can't buy you the tableware set he promised. I'm just a mechanic who makes 70 won a day. I'm worthless. I wanted to be successful but I failed. I really liked you, yeong. I loved you so much I risked everything. I gave him everything I had. Without an ounce of sorrow, jt understood what it was to be a woman. One day when he comes back, he'll wash this wound white as snow.
