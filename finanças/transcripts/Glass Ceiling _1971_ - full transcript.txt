Marta, I've got my things from the bathroom but can't find my comb. This time it's not in my purse, did you look? I've looked everywhere, I even asked the cat. Why don't you go and buy me fifty combs? Tomorrow you can have fun spreading them around the house. At least you've plenty of shirts. Better than finding yourself without one. Can you tell me how to put this on? You must think I'm a rotten housewife. Always mixing up your packing. No but if you'd have found this on my return you'd have beat me round the head. I'd always know my own bras from theirs. Hurry, you have to catch the bus soon. There's more than half an hour. What games can we play until then? Half an hour is too little. Now sit down and I'll make you a coffee. The milk hasn't arrived yet though. That's alright, I'm fine. I'll use more sugar. Ever been curious what the wife does when the husband is away? No, because I know. She's unfaithful. Do you know who with? Of course. With many. You're so wrong. One man is enough for me.. ..I mean, one woman.. The cat. I spend the whole day playing with her and at night she sleeps with me in our bed. lf you have to cheat, why not give Ricardo a break? Take the mind off his work, his dogs, his strange figurines and he would forget to collect the rent. Call me whenever you like, I'll always be here. That's fine, I'll check to see if you are. here's your milk. Do you want to come in? No thanks, I have to go. Goodbye. Who is it? - It's me Rosa Just the one today Rosa. - here you go. Rosa, as from tomorrow, one bottle per day should be enough. Very well ma'am. you're a late today. I don't know how you stand the heat from that furnace in the summer. I need it for my work, how else can I bake all those figurines? Were you impatient for the milk today? I just noticed you were later than usual. The cows were difficult to milk this morning they didn't know you wanted your breakfast, mister. Don't call me mister, I'm not that old. Of course not, I can see that. It's for another reason. For what reason? I really respect you. You're the only person that has any respect for me. It's hot in here, let's go. I think that the lot. Wait a moment and I'll pay you. Don't worry about it, we'll put it on your account. Do you feel like having some wine? Very well, I don't suppose one glass would hurt. Have a seat. Your husband went out of town didn't he? Yes, he left this morning. How did you know? When you place small orders like the one today it's obvious that your husband's gone away. You must eat like a bird.. lf I may? It's terrible. What's terrible? You having to stay all alone... How do you mean? I mean a man shouldn't travel so often leaving his wife alone. Especially when she's as pretty as you. You'll probably get fat just sitting around waiting for him. But you can always count on me. That's why whenever your husband's out of town I always arrange it so that it's me who delivers your groceries. You'd better leave now. Take it easy. Remember it was you who invited me for a drink. Don't think that you're the only woman in this situation. There are plenty of women who get bored.. ..who get bored... nearly as much as you do. You'd better leave. But why? You're not going to do anything. Alright, nothing happened. Absolutely nothing. Just don't forget that you're the loser. But if you want to make it difficult, I can make up a nice little story. Get out. A little story about countless housewives, and they were all bored. Get out, bastard. Thanks for the wine. Remember, when you call the supermarket to always ask for Pedro. There's a fortune at stake in this event and no matter how many drivers have been eliminated, the great race continues. What's wrong Vedra? Are you tired? So am I. Or perhaps it's just boredom. We're both bored. Can you hear Julia? She's also going to bed. And that's Victor. I wonder why Victor's always ill? It must be awful. It's very late Vedra. Julia's still walking around. I wonder if Victor's worse? Remind me tomorrow to ask Julia how he is. Vedra, wake up. What a pair of sleepy-heads. Is that you Carlos? Yes, I can hear you perfectly. Sure I'm surprised. No, I just didn't expect to hear from you so soon. Yes, I'm fine. I just woke up a second ago. What a shame. You sure you'll only be a couple more days? No, of course I'm not angry. And of course I'm looking at your photograph all the time. Don't say things like that. Don't forget to call more often. Sorry to bother but the refrigerator isn't working and this food cost a lot of money. Every time you call a repairman you wait forever for them to arrive. I've plenty of room in mine, bring whatever you want. Take a seat, I've got some coffee ready. No, don't trouble yourself, please. It's no trouble. Truth is when Carlo's away, I'm grateful for the company. I confess, it gets a little lonely around here. I think I understand. I also know what it's like to be lonely. Victor went out of town. When? Yesterday afternoon. I went with him to the bus stop. Want a pastry? - No, they're too fattening. I've never been too worried about my weight. There's milk if you like? It's curious, when I opened the door for you this morning I was going to ask how Victor was. Last night I thought he was worse. Why did you think that? I was positive I heard him walking around. No, Victor will have to be away for a few days. Legal difficulties, inheritance or something like that. Those things are very complicated. I suffer from insomnia and sometimes I walk around all night. You probably think I'm mad but when I'm alone just the slightest noise drives me out of my mind. I'm fortunate living in the top apartment. I only have to put up with the howling of those dogs. Well, have to go. - So soon? Why not drop in on me now and again? Good idea, I'll do that. Thanks for this, I hope they fix my refrigerator soon. You don't have to worry, use mine whenever you want. That's odd. I'd have sworn those were Victor's footsteps. Didn't you think so Vedra? Well, we must have imagined it. Why would Julia lie? This gets tougher every day. I have to travel further each time to find clay for your damn figures. Those two women alone again? Yes, the devil must like his friends. You could have them both just by lifting your little finger. You're the landlord, what's the matter? They're ready, now. Don't talk so loud. Why don't you shut up. The one upstairs with the sick chap and below who's always alone. lf you had guts.. - What would happen, tell me? You know what would happen. And that Rosa.. one day she's going to get pregnant. She'll find a man. And dancing.. boy, does she move. You've danced with her? No. But I always like to watch them dancing. Boy, what goes on in there.. Watching in the back of the theatre Watch the parked cars when it's night. I see it all. Well, let's see if you can find where to put the clay. It's fine, I'll take care of the rest. Didn't I tell you.. Sorry, I wasn't expecting you, I'll get my shirt. No don't worry, just be comfortable. Is there anything wrong Marta? No, I was just bored and I saw you entering your studio. Well, whenever you're bored, just come down to the studio and I can teach you a little about ceramics. It's a bit messy isn't it? No but it's terribly hot in here. Yes, I have some figures baking in the oven. Would you like to go outside? Is your husband going to be away for long? Much too long. Julia's alone again too. Victor's away too? Husbands have to make money. The house of lonely wives. Looks like these are the only two that are inseparable. This heatwave is murder. Do you fancy a cold drink or ice coffee? Another day. But I'll accept the invitation another day on the condition that Carlos doesn't get jealous. lf he's jealous he'll just have to suffer. He's also got a lot of female clients. Supermarket? It's Julia. It's you.. Send me over half a pound of butter. I'll need some detergent, a bottle of cognac and some salt. Will I see you? Another package. Probably more samples. Did my husband get a good seat on the bus yesterday? Yes he did. He sat right beside me. Throughout the whole journey into town we were discussing how lovely women are. Especially in the summertime! And my neighbour's husband, Victor, he speaks about women too? I don't know. He's never travelled on my route. He didn't take the bus yesterday? No, the afternoon schedule was suspended. The bus broke down. Anything else? No and many thanks for bringing me the package. It was nothing signora, goodbye. Next time a package arrives just phone me and I'll collect it. It's really no trouble. Did you hear that Vedra? And what does it matter to us? He could've taken a taxi? Hello Rosa. - What brings you here? They said you were sick. - It was nothing. I'm glad. See you later then. Were you worried? Not really, why? Because you heard I was ill? No, I was just passing and dropped by to see how you were. Where's your father? In the field. He won't be back until afternoon. Well, I'll leave you to your work. Wait. Want a drink of milk? Come on Ever drink milk like this? Yes, when I was a boy. Want something to drink it with? No, I'd really remember what it was like when I was a boy. I couldn't resist it. Do you play that trick on many people? Only a few. Mostly on children but never on a man like you. And what should I do now, spank you? Why not? You have visitors. Visitors? Who? A woman and a little girl. They're upstairs. I'd better go and check. Rita! It's been ages since I saw you. You certainly live a long was from the city. Jolanda, she's grown. - She couldn't wait to see you. Come in. It's that way. It's fantastic, Rita in my house. Are you staying for lunch? Just try and get rid of me. I spent two hours on the bus just to see you. How's Carlos? - He's on a trip That's perfect, we can spend the whole day gossiping. Well let's sit down then? - Not again after that bus ride. Who's that character down there? That's Ricardo the landlord. What a beauty. And he's rich? And he's single. He's single? Don't tempt me An Apollo looking for consolation. And your husband sleeps well with him for a neighbour? You must introduce before I leave. Marta, it's been years since we've seen each other. And you're my best friend. - I'm hungry. You haven't changed at all in these years and I've got as fat as.. ..a pig. You got a slaughterhouse near here? No but there's a pigsty right behind the house. It belongs to the Adonis you saw downstairs this morning. I just have to meet this man. Don't poison me with that coffee, I can't drink it too strong. Do you remember when we were children. and how suspicious we were about your grandmother's trunk? We even suspected that my grandfather had murdered her. Anyway nobody ever wanted to talk about it. Would you like me to tell you an authentic mystery? So you're completely certain that the footsteps you heard were a man's? Finally she's asleep. We can talk freely now. Are you sure it was a man's footsteps? Of course they were. lf not, why would I hear Julia walking with slippers and immediately after heavy footsteps as if someone was leaving the house? Maybe you've hit on something? Of course.. a man's footsteps are noticeable... Then if it's wasn't her husband it was a lover!? That's it Marta, it's her lover. Isn't that solution just what we wanted it to be? Perhaps.. But you forgot one thing Julia's husband didn't go out of town and I proved it by asking the driver who was on duty. So if he didn't go out of town, and if he isn't at home it's because Julia and her lover have murdered Victor. Genius. But who is the lover? Ricardo, who else? He'd make anyone desert their husband. Besides, if Victor wasn't able to do his thing.. I'll be right back and we can continue to play detective. I hate to trouble you but my refrigerator's still broken. Come on, you know it's no trouble. No, I don't have much time. Come in, I want you to meet someone. Rita, I'd like you to meet Julia, my only female neighbour. Rita's my best friend and it's been years since we've seen each other. And this young lady is Jolanda, her daughter. Hello, Jolanda. You're very pretty. Mama, isn't that the lady you said had a lover? That was horrible, Vedra. Rita's daughter deserves a good spanking. Tomorrow I'll have to apologise to Julia I don't want her to think that.. Let's promise to never imagine things again. Not even for fun. Vedra How would you make someone disappear completely? I bet you think I'm mad. I made a promise and I've just broken it. Looks like a miniature gate to hell, doesn't it? I bet anything would burn in that furnace. Yes in only a few minutes even a person could completely disappear. Can you smell something bad? A bad odour? Yes, like something rotting. It's probably the clay? No it's not the clay, smells more like decomposed flesh. I think it's coming from over there. Probably a dead rat. Let's get out of here. What did you see in the wood pile, something unpleasant? No, I was just surprised to see a man's shoe there. It's not unusual. Nowadays they'll sell anything as firewood. So does that invitation for a coffee still stand? Yes, of course. Do you want a few scraps for the beasts? Not today, they're off their food. Let me know when they're hungry. Don't forget the number.. Trying to read the dregs? No. I was just thinking it's very good coffee. Want another cup? Who's walking about? It's Julia. You're bored, aren't you? A little bit. It's normal. But then there's the house cleaning and I have the cat. Those are our enemies. - What enemies? Your cat and my studio. They make us forget people. Perhaps that's right but.. there's one thing I can't understand.. Why is it you're single? Who would want anyone like me? You're far too modest. For example, my friend who was here the other day told me you looked like a very interesting man. And tell me, where is this friend? At home with her husband and daughter. You see, there you have it. Nothing left but my work. Marta, would you accept an invitation? - What? A day in the countryside. We can ride horses. Why not? We'll momentarily escape my cat and your studio. Are you serious? - Completely serious. I'll substitute the ceiling for the clear sky. What ceiling are you talking about? - The glass ceiling I don't understand. It's a long story. When we're far away I'll tell you all about it. As you wish. Did you want something? I thought you were going to start sculpting me? Really? Are you sure you'd like me to? That's why I came. Well? Take your clothes off. You don't expect me to sculpt you with your clothes on? But I thought.. The eyes of an artist aren't like those of other men. What my eyes see is not important the only thing that matters is what I feel. So it doesn't matter? It's as if you see nothing? Yes, something like that. Sculptors work with their hands Do it blindfolded without seeing me. Well, if you don't trust me.. Hey, what's that smell? I guess a mole or a dead rat in the firewood. This will fix it. It was you who showed me that trick. Tie it tightly. Like two children playing Blind Man's Bluff. No, children don't play at this game. Are you ready? Come on, get you're clothes off. Like something rotting. Please come back, Carlos.. Come back soon. I'm sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt. - Don't worry, Marta It's very pleasant sunbathing in the nude. Would you mind giving me my sunglasses? I hope you're still not embarrassed about what the child said? We were talking about a detective story we'd both read. I don't know how the child could have said that. Children have fantastic imaginations. Are you going into town? Yes, later. Mind getting me a few things? - Of course. Will you be long? - No, I won't be more than an hour. Wait, I'll get you some money. No, don't bother. We can settle it later. Hello? No, I'm her neighbour. One moment please. She's just coming. Who is it? - I think your husband but it's a bad line. Is it really you? What a surprise. That's great. How is business? So little time? Not even a couple of days? Well, it's better than nothing. Don't be silly. Yes, it was Marta. Of course I'll be waiting for you. Goodbye Victor. Victor's arriving tonight, he's forgotten a document I'm afraid he won't stay long though. That's good news. I've been contemplating your work. It's nothing yet. There's lots to do before I finish. In that case I'll leave you to finish your work. Is tomorrow alright? - Tomorrow? The day in the countryside? - Well...why not? Do you like riding horseback? - Wait and see. By the way, there was a dead rat in the firewood. It's funny how the wood had fallen. I have a confession to make. - What's that? The pile of firewood wasn't scattered by rats. Two nights ago I was in your studio. - Were you? Yes, it's to do with that long story. We've got the whole day ahead of us. You're going to laugh at me. - Try me, I might not. Mind if I check the horses? - Sure, they're in the stables for you. So you were suspicious of me? - Of you? Didn't you expect to find a corpse hidden in my studio? No, I never said that. Let's say then that you thought Julia had hidden the body there without my knowing it? I suppose so. It was childish of me. Anyway, the game's over now. So you're tired of playing detective? I can't play detective any longer, because there's been no murder. Victor was at home last night. - You see. That settles it. It's so peaceful here. Anyway, the horses are waiting. lf I don't cook it today it'll spoil. I'll bring you the plate later. No. Don't bother, Julia. So you said Victor only came for a few hours? He took the bus early this morning. I couldn't keep him much longer. I must be losing my woman's touch. Can you keep a secret? - Yes, of course. We won't be living for much longer in this building. My husband's bought a house in the city. I spoke with Ricardo to put the flat up for rent next month. Next month, really? It could've been much sooner. This heat's awful. Can I have an ice-coffee, please? Why not add alcohol to that coffee? It's good when the weather's hot. Alright, I'll try it. By the way, are there any other packages for my husband? Well, no... but perhaps tomorrow. Not bad at all. Now you learnt something new. Be careful though. I almost forgot... My neighbour, the one who lives above me she wants to know if her husband arrived on time for the bus this morning? He must have got there late. On that trip the only passengers were two priests and a few soldiers on their way to the base. You know, in the summer very few people travel so it's easy to remember who's on the bus. And wasn't my neighbour, Victor, on it? Are you certain? Yes, I'm completely sure. Unless he was disguised as one of the soldiers or a priest? Because I'm now certain, Rita, that the voice on the phone wasn't Victor's. And if Victor didn't come home, why did Julia lie to me? And if Victor's dead, then where's the body? What did she do with it? I'm sure if I could discover what happened to the corpse I could solve the whole mystery. Can I come in? - I wasn't expecting you How did you get in? - The door was open Can I get you something? I only came to make another invitation. An afternoon fishing. Don't tempt me Ricardo. Just look at this house, it's a mess. I know a spot nearby where a thousand fish are waiting. Now would you let them down? A thousand fish waiting? lf I wasn't so bored, you wouldn't win me over so easily. Wait a moment and I'll change my clothes. I think we've uncovered new clues regarding the 'glass ceiling'. Top secret. The only one who knows is the cat. I didn't know you were such a sharpshooter. A lot of practice. I used to be better. Want to try? No, never. They frighten me to death. I'll stop if you like? Remember it was you that invited me for an afternoon's fishing. Not to go target shooting. You're right.. Like I promised there's a thousand fish in the river. Let's go. Ever wondered what bait looks like to fish underwater? No, I never used my imagination that much. On the other hand you dreamed up that fantastic story. But I can hear footsteps and strange noises. I understand. And when you can't see anything, you imagine the reasons for those strange noises. You like to witness the private lives of people. And when this starts to bore you, when you're no longer amused by it you invent a death. You must thing I'm weird? - No, not at all Have you ever heard of voyeurism? Voyeurs are people who get a thrill out of spying on the most intimate and most personal secrets of other people. Sounds good but nobody ever told me that I was a voyeur. At most a peeping-tom. And would you say that all snoopers deserve to be called voyeurs? An elegant name like that? Yes, I'd say nearly everybody in the world. lf not, what do you think the object is of cinema or photography? I don't know. Someone once said that photography is truth and cinema is truth twenty-four times a second. It's a pretty phrase.. but I think it's false. There's simply a release, an escape valve for this voyeur instinct. Like you said, snooping for example it's this instinct that absolutely everyone has in them. Ricardo, the rod. At least we caught one of the thousand fishes that are here. Little fella, you shouldn't have played around with something you didn't know about. I never would have thought you were so observant. Now I'm the one who's being observed. I think we're both a little strange. Will you promise me something? - What? That we'll stay friends? - Why shouldn't we stay friends? It's best that we leave Ricardo, don't you think? When will it be finished? - I don't know, I might never finish it. Why not? You only have the face left. I'll be able to come tomorrow for a couple of hours. No need to come back again. You prefer to work from memory? Whatever you like. But if it doesn't resemble me, I'll hate you. What a fool I am. Don't pay any attention. I could never hate you. Rosa, you just don't understand what I'm trying to tell you. I just don't want you to come back. The statue's strange. Sometimes it's the body of one woman and the face and expression of another. Now I see. When the other one gets here you'll copy her face. Marta? I wasn't referring to her. I didn't mean that one, I meant Julia. She's got the perfect face for a body in the nude. Julia? Why Julia? Because I've seen you together. Because she's the type that all you men like. Don't be so childish. I'm not a child anymore. Here's your change. - No, keep it Have you finished for the day? - Almost All I have to do is leave the bill for Julia. I'll leave it under the door. Under the door? Why not just give it to her? I don't like bothering her. Besides, I just saw Ricardo go up to her flat. Yes, it's the end of the month, he probably went for the rent. Yes, of course. That's it.. Taking care of debts. Well, goodbye. What did you want Ricardo? - I wanted to apologise for yesterday Don't worry about it. Still friends? - Yes, of course. Will you take me fishing again at the river? lf you want to. I'd never forgive you if you didn't ask me. But aren't the poor dogs hungry? I don't think so. They haven't touched a thing for almost a week. I've asked the vet to come over. These dogs can't go four or five days without eating. What's the matter? Calm down, Marta. You're alright now, it's all over. Shall I get another cold compress? - Yes, good idea. Please don't leave. - Take it easy, it was just a case of indigestion. No, it's not that. Don't leave me alone with her. Don't worry about a thing, just relax, Marta. She looks better now. - Yes, she's recovering You probably have things to do Julia, I'll stay here. I'll get my shopping done then, call me if you need anything. Don't worry, see you later. Didn't you see that pulley? That's how she's been bringing her husband's body down. That's why the dogs won't eat anything. The other night I heard the squeaking of that pulley. Get some rest, I'll be right here beside you. Sorry if I startled you. I was in your room before but you were sleeping. Sorry, it's just that my nerves are on edge. I'm alright now. It'll be good for you, drink up. Did I sleep for long? You needed a rest and you gave us quite a fright. Ricardo just left and said to phone if you need anything. Would you like me to stay with you? - No. No need. Don't forget to call me if you need anything. Yes of course. - That's fine, bye Marta Bye Julia, you've been marvellous. Hello, are you busy? - No, come in. You're looking better. Yes I'm alright now. Like a cigarette? - No, I'd better not. May I? Are you sure you're feeling alright? I'm still a little sleepy, but I'm fine. What I could really use is something to drink. I could prepare you an orange juice? Please do, that would be fine. - Just a moment, I'll get it. Shall I give you a hand? - No, just relax. You're the patient. Sorry it's not very cold. Ricardo, is that you? No, I'm alright. It's really too horrible. Now I'm completely certain of it. About Julia, Ricardo. About Julia. She's a murderer. Please, you've got to listen to me. No, it's not my imagination. I looked in Julia's refrigerator. I discovered...a finger. No, I'm not mad. Your dogs remember? Why do you think they didn't want to eat? She's had him concealed all this time. And she's going to move away. Yes, she's moving. Didn't she tell you anything? I'll be waiting here. And you should bring somebody with you. You have to be careful. Vedra. Who is it? Please, speak? Answer me. Leave the phone off the hook. Don't say anything to her at all. Who is this? Besides, I just saw Ricardo go up to her flat. ..up to her flat. I'm leaving now, Marta. My husband's waiting for me at our new house. I'd like you to tell Ricardo that we've left. And could you give him these keys? My new address. You will visit us sometime? Yes, of course. - Good, I'll be expecting you. Leave the house immediately. Don't stay alone. Don't stay alone. Don't stay alone. Marta, what are you doing here? It was horrible, Carlos.. She's killed her husband. And now they want to murder me. You have to do something, Carlos. Help me, Carlos. You imagined it. It's your imagination. It's not my imagination, I'm certain of it. Alright, we'll speak with Julia, you'll see everything will be fine. Do you have her address? And what pretext do we use for visiting at this hour? It's nearly two o'clock. - I don't know. Anything. Say I had to go to the city to meet you. Say anything, I don't care what pretext. And what if her husband's with her? Then I'll know that I'm insane. We can leave it at the bar next to the bus station. Are you sure this is the house? - Yes, this is it. What a beautiful house. - Yes, Victor's family's very wealthy. She's taking a long time. - No doubt they're in bed. Here they are. What a surprise. I was about to go to bed, come in. Is your husband in? Yes, he's just gone to bed. I'll call him, I'm sure he's awake. We'll only keep you for a moment, Julia. It's rather embarrassing to intrude on you at this hour. You'll probably think that Marta's mad but.. Well, we'll talk about it with him. Sit down, I'm afraid we've nothing to offer you to drink but take a seat. Pardon me a moment while I wake Victor. Oh if Victor's sleeping, please don't disturb him. We can discuss it tomorrow. That's alright, he'll be annoyed if I don't. You'd like to live in a house like this wouldn't you? Of course I would. - One day we'll have one, you'll see. Don't you think they're taking a long time? Not surprising. lf I were him, I'd be very annoyed. When he comes down we'll have to invent a story. He'll really think you're insane. That's possible, let's see if I'm completely mad. Think she'll try to escape? - Wait a minute Are you there, Julia? Where are you? Where are you Carlos? Are you there? Go on, kill her. I killed your husband but it was your idea to bring her here. Kill her and get it over with. Give me the razor.
