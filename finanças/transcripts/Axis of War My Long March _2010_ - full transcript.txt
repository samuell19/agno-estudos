Behind us, there were countless sacrificed brothers. In front of us, there are endless mountains. Where shall we go! Huh? Where shall we go? Will the Red Army's energy come to an end? Changzi, can you be quieter? I want to be louder. Let that foreign officer hear. Let brothers' bodies ward off the enemy's bullets and bombs. That is not fighting. That is warding off the bullets. Our brothers of the 1st and 3rd Corps are fighting hard to protect our Central Army as they cross the river. But what about us? We are creeping slowly like snails. This will cause many casualties. Little comrade, this infected wound must be cut out so that your arm will heal quickly. We have no anaesthetic. Can you bear the pain for a while? Doctor, can you tell me whether my arm will heal? No problem. It will leave a scar. Go on. Brother Changzi, if you cannot bear the pain, please bite my wrist, then you will feel a little better. Yazi, Yazi, Yazi. Yazi, Yazi. Don't worry.

Daddy... I will look after Rui Yazi and Zhu Meizi. Don't worry. I promise. Sister, shall we go? Go. Where shall we go? Follow them. ZUNYI What's your name? Rui Yazi, Wang Rui. I did not see you following the directors before. The superior leaders said there will be an important meeting here. Let us enhance the guard. I was assigned here. Comrade, come and sit by the fire. It is cold. It would be better if there was something to eat. Come. I have some fried soybeans from the director. Thanks. What's the name of this place? I heard this is Zunyi. The director said that this is in Guizhou Province. Do you know where the Red Army will go next? Nobody knows. Our chief of company said he didn't know. My daddy didn't know when he was alive. He just let me follow. I noticed that foreign officer from Communist International was unhappy. He did not order the others like the emperor's father any more. Our director is a little happier, but he doesn't feel like speaking. And he always smokes, and smokes heavily. - Who is your director? - Chairman Mao. Chairman Mao, I know him. You know him? Comrade Huafu only knows how to talk about fighting on paper, but he doesn't consider that the warriors will walk, eat and sleep. He doesn't ask whether there are hill roads, plains or rivers. He only knows how to draw on the map drafted by headquarters to limit the time of fighting. This is not the way to win. Report. Who is it? What's happened? I am bringing the evening meal. It's noodles. We don't want to eat. You've come at the wrong time. Take it away. This order was confusing. You, as a foreign officer, do not worry about that. Vice-chairman Zhou, the 2nd Division of the enemy is coming to Jinsha and Zunyi. I know. Don't fight if you have no strength. I agree with Mao. Hurry up. This is Zhou Enlai. What time? Yes, yes. Attack immediately. Are you the man who sent noodles? Yes. You should understand why Chairman Mao lost his temper. The meeting is very serious and you interrupted his train of thought. Do you know how important this meeting is? It is snowing! Please take a seat, Director. Are you the man who sent noodles? I know you. Of course you know me because I blamed you. - I'm sorry for that. - I knew you before. You knew me before? When we crossed the Xiang River and the enemy's planes bombed us, I fell down and you pulled me up. What's your name? My name is Rui Yazi. - Surname? - Wang. - Is your name Wang Rui? - Yes. - You are from Ruijin? - Yes. Smoke? A young man does not know about worrying. You won't learn if you do not smoke. You are cleaning. I am creating trouble for you. - No. - Then I will not smoke. - No, Chairman. You... - Don't call me Chairman any more. The Soviet republican land is lost. I will not be a chairman. You can call me Lao Mao. No, I dare not. Chairman, you've had meetings for many days. Please go to bed and rest. I cannot sleep soundly. Rui Yazi, what's in your pocket? A meeting was held and the electricity cut off due to an air raid. These are the candle ends left by the directors. Maybe they can be used again some time. Good. - You look after them. - Yes. Rui Yazi, comb my hair. Yes. Thank you, Rui Yazi. I will go and wash my hands. Don't move. Stay here. Chairman, are you asleep? No. You remember my words that this room where we are holding our meetings may be talked about by people in the future for thim years, fifty years or a hundred years. Chairman, why does the Red Army come here to hold meetings? Nobody invites us here. We come here ourselves and we are retreating. We understand when the Red Army comes here, we should not make the same mistakes. We should go along our own road. That means here in Zunyi the Red Army knows where we should go. Where should we go? Where should we go? I, Mao Zedong, don't know where we should go, but I know I cannot make the same mistakes. Not only I know, but many people are beginning to know too. My daddy let me follow everywhere. The company chief also said so. You daddy told you to follow, your company chief also said so, so we cannot go the wrong way any more. Rui Yazi how many people : are there in your family now? Five people were killed by the enemy. Only three people, no, four people left. They have now joined the Red Army. Who are they? They are my daddy, my sister and me. There is another one. It's my brother-in-law. My sister is in the field hospital aa a nurse and my brother-in-law is in the same company with me. Where is your daddy? Your daddy? When? When he crossed the Xiang River. Let's go to the market and I'll buy a bowl of food for you. Join the Red Army, if you want to be a soldier Join the Red Army, if you want to be a soldier Workers and farmers like the Red Army, Officers and soldiers are equal in the Red Army Nobody forces you in the Red Army Join the Red Army, if you want to be a soldier To fight bravely, to kill the enemy To kill bad army soldiers The democratic rights revolution will be flnished Will be finished JOlN THE RED ARMY Chairman. Chairman. Hello, Chairman. -Are you going to buy vegetables? -Chairman? - Buying vegetables? - We're going to buy good food today. Sister. Rui Yazi. Hey, what are you doing out? I gave Rui Yazi the day off. Sister, this is Chairman Mao. Are you Rui Yazi's brother-in-law? Hello, Chairman. I haven't entered the bridal chamber yet. It doesn't matter. That means you are Rui Yazi's brother-in-law-to-be. Hello, Chairman. He is Xiao Dechang and I am Wang Zhumei. I know. Chairman, where will our Red Army go? We...We were just discussing that. Just follow. Chairman Mao is really outstanding. I heard the Red Army will be commanded by Chairman Mao after leaving Zunyi. In only a few days, you can see the difference. If Tucheng could not be conquered, the army turned to cross the Chishui River. Nobody died for nothing. Hey, Company Commander, why is this river called the Chishui River? I don't know. I heard from local people that on both sides of the river there is red soil. When it rains heavily, the red soil washed into the river dyes the water red, so it is called Chishui. Chishui River. This name sounds lucky. I heard there is a town called Moutai which produces strong Moutai wine. Hey, you naughty boy, do you want to drink wine? Oh, no. I want my sister's hospital to buy more as disinfectant. You are so clever. That's a good idea. The rearguard army has been fighting with the enemy. The situation is too urgent to have a child now. When Zhu Meizi and I marry, we will not have a child. Nonsense! When the revolution is successful, we'll bring up more children. - Hey, Company Commander. - Shut up! No more nonsense. We must concentrate on this guard task. This revolutionay seed must be planted safely even if it costs our lives. Commander, who is having a baby? I don't know. It's our Red Army. Yazi. Go and see whether she's had a baby. Yes. - Be careful. - Yes. Sister Zizhen, congratulations. It's a girl. Dr Fu, thank you very much. How about the army? Chairman. Zizhen. Runzhi. How are you? l'm fine. Dr Fu and the other doctors worked hard. Thank you. I appreciate your hard work. Thank you. Chairman! Look atyour daughter. Zizhen, does she look like you or me? I haven't had time, to look at her properly. Look at this face. If there is a beauty spot on her jaw, she will bear a remarkable resemblance to her father. What a beautiful girl! It is not a good time for her. Zizhen, we do not know how far we will go, or how many difficulties we will face, so leave this baby here. No, do not throw this baby away. Runzhi, l am a Red Army soldier too. I understand the army's discipline. But have you thought about our first baby who was left in Longyan of Fujian? Mao Mao was left in Jiangxi. There is no news about Anying, Anqing and Anlong. This baby has just come into the world today. It's arrived at the wrong time. This is not a good time for her. Zizhen, I am not as hard as stone, but the Red Army has a strict mission. I know my blood is flowing in this baby's body, but the revolution cannot stop us from being separated from our children. Bring the stretcher in. Dr Fu, get ready to start. Yes. Xiao Wu, the common people hid. Take out our silver coins and food and put them here. Yes, sir. Sister Zizhen. Sister Zizhen. Put the baby on the bed and cover her with a quilt. Let's go. Wait. Runzhi... We have not given the baby a name. There is no need. When the revolution is successful, in the future, it will be good if we can find her. in case we cannot find her, it is also good that she is a Miao girl, isn't it? "We are the Red Army, which is the poor people's army." "Today we procreate in the Miao region." "I hope the common people here can bring her up." LOUSHANGUAN Number one platoon, go down to the trench. Dechang, lead the troop to the east. Number three platoon, go up. Hurry up! Commander, we are back here again. Yes, we are back again. We have been to the Chishui River and returned mice. The director said at the meeting we are avoiding the enemy and looking for a chance to attack them. I trust Chairman Mao's commanding. We can win the battle eventually if there are not so many Red Army soldiers shot down like before. When we came out from Gu Lin County, I saw Chairman Mao. His hair is long and he looked pale. He also used his hand to cover his stomach. He is very different from the former Chairman Mao. You mean Chairman Mao is behind us? I guess he is no more than a mile behind us. Can you tell me why he always covers his stomach with his hand? Is that real? Rui Yazi. Rui Yazi. He is here. It's time to fight? It's none of your business. You, go back along the troop and to the west. Give this rice cake to Chairman Mao. Go. Where is Chairman Mao? You can ask with your mouth. You can find him within one mile. Hurry up. Yes. Hey, take the gun. Hey, what are you doing now? The instructor did not give you permission to move. You should understand this is an order. I am not happy! My wound has healed. Fire. Chang Yazi. Chang Yazi ran away too fast. Hurry up, hurry up. We have taught the enemy a lesson for the first time since we left the central Soviet region. Come on! Hey, what are you doing? Don't move. Stop hitting the pipe. Get up, get up. Changzi. Look,Commander. They're hardly moving. They crave drugs. Hello,Commander. Hey, why did it take you so long? Did you see Chairman Mao? Did you give the rice cake to Chairman Mao? I finished off six. I wanted you to give him the rice cake, but you ate six. How many in total? I killed six enemies, including one company commander. What? Where? On the left wing. I fought with the other company. How about Chairman Mao? You really killed six? Rui Yazi, you are still a new soldier although you killed six ofthe enemy. You have still not taken the rice cake to Chairman Mao. OK, Chairman Mao could not eat it, but I'll let you eat it. Fight on. Drive these tortoises into the Wujiang River. Commander. What? Look at the floating bridge. The floating bridge was bombed by the enemy. They are afraid of us driving them. How bad they are! Forward! That's great! Since we left Jiangxi, we've run here and there like wild rabbits. Today we will change this situation. The Red Army drives the Central Army and will kick its hip. Rui Yazi also contributed for the great victory at Loushanguan. Rui Yazi has killed six of the enemy. Don't praise him. Chairman Mao. Hello, Chairman Mao. - Hello, Chairman. - Chairman Mao. - Chairman, Chairman. - Hello, everyone. It is Rui Yazi, isn't it? At Loushanguan, Yazi killed six of the enemy. You are great! Comrade Rui Yazi has become a hero within one night. Chairman, I did not finish my task. Our company commander wanted me to give you a rice cake, but I did not finish the task. Our commander also wanted to punish me. This is our commander. Chairman Mao, our instructor... Our instructor saw you, cover your stomach with your hand. We were worried you might be hungry. It was hard to get this rice cake. I'll eat it. I'll eat it. Chairman, I know where the Red Army will go. Where? To the place where we'll defeat the enemy. Good, Rui Yazi. Your words are good. The great pass roads are like iron. But go over them today. Go over them. One, two, three. Get away. The Red Army comes to set you free. - We are opening it. - Be careful. They are there. Slowly. Come, get up. Yazi, stone. - Hurry! - For you. Go home, please. The instructor is there. Instructor. I... What's wrong? I, I... - Brother Changzi's knife was stolen. - What? What did you do, Xiao Dechang? You were promoted to be a monitor recently, but you have had big trouble. Knife is a weapon. It is your second life. Do you understand? You, what do you want? It's you. If you hadn't given the knife back, I would have been punished. Keep up. Why are you following us? Hey, do you understand Mandarin? Mandarin. A deaf-mute. You are deaf-mute. Ah, you understand Mandarin. Have a rest. Brother Changzi, where did you get tobacco leaf from? It's not tobacco leaf, it's tree leaf. I heard it can be smoked, but it is a little bitter. You don't smoke, do you? I'm preparing it for our daddy. Why don't you leave? Why did you steal my knife? I wanted revenge. Revenge? Then you can leave now. Why are you following us? I want to follow you. Follow us? But I cannot make that decision. I'll have to ask the leader. Ask what? Hello, Instructor. This is the man who stole my knife. But the knife has been returned. He stole my knife to get revenge. The poor people suffer deep hatred. There's no need for explanations. He says he wants to go with us. There's no need to ask. We accept all poor people who want to join the Red Army. - What's your name? - Daerhuo. Da-Er-Huo. Only three Chinese characters. Good. The Yi man has a long name. It is hard to remember. Daerhuo, stay with this group. He is your monitor. His name is Xiao Dechang. This is our instructor. His name is Lao He. My surname is Zeng and I am the commander. Monitor. Lao He,lnstructor. Commander Zeng. Daerhuo, there is no weapon for you at the moment. Changzi, give your big knife to Daerhuo for now. Yes. Take the opportunity to rest. Lao He, we will go through the Yi region. I'll go to the front I and you stay at the rear. This is our Yi region. Then say goodbye to your hometown. Yes. After the Red Army leaves, maybe you won't come back for mo or three years. Go. Comrades, this is the new comrade in our group. His name is Daerhuo. Please welcome him. OK. Daerhuo,sitdown. Just now you were wearing this big cape and I almost did not recognise you. Monitor, this is not a big cape. It is a "Chaerwa". It can be used as clothes in the day and as a quilt at night. Do your family members agree with you joining the Red Army? There are no other people in my family. All my family members were killed by "officials". Hey. - Why are you beating him? - Why? Hey, sit down. All of you, sit down. Daerhuo, Rui Yazi was just touching your hair. Why did you lose your temper? - Not hair. - Not hair? What's that, then? Bodhisattva. Is it worth beating him for that? Beat? If I wasn't a Red Army soldier, I would have used my knife. Monitor, Monitor, Monitor, I was wrong. Daerhuo beat you, but you acknowledge the mistake. I am a Red Army soldier, not a child, so I must admit the mistake if I did something wrong. Chairman Mao said the Red Army will not make the same mistakes. Daerhuo,Daerhuo, it's my fault. Good. You are a good boy. OK, OK. Yazi admitted the mistake. Daerhuo beat him since he is a new soldier and does not know our rules. The proverb says we make friends by beating each other. So, shake hands. From now on, you will be comrades sharing weal and woe. Let's congratulate them. Don't fire. Anyone who fires will be punished by militay law. Yi fellowmen. We are the Red Army. We are your beloved army. Daerhuo, maybe they don't understand my Mandarin. You repeat what I said. Louder. OK. Yi fellowmen. We are the Red Army. We are your beloved army. Yi fellowmen. We are the Red Army. We are your beloved army. It's not good to confront each other. We should send mo people to explain to the Yi people. Commander, let me go with you. Commander. Sister. You stay here. Let me go. I am a female. When the Yi people see me, they will not take more precautions. Hey, brother leng, brother He, the situation is very urgent. Let me do it. Don't worry about me. I know what to do. Let the Yi people know that the Red Army is good. Sister, I'll go with you. I'll go, too. I can communicate. Maybe someone knows me, Daerhuo. OK,one sister,one boy and one Yi brother. They don't look like they'll attack. Let's go. Sister, I'm a little afraid. Don't be afraid. Let me sing a mountain song for you. Hey... The men went through the Gan River to take salt Hey I heard the brother joins the Red Army Hey To watch the village entrance three times a day Wake up mom the dream and feel sweetness in the heart The Red Army is the common people's soldier Red pentacle star is on the head Hey The reaping hooh draws a new world The axe beats evils especially Hey The Red Army is expected to come back early It becomes clear after the Red Army arrives The poor people become free from now The red cuchoo flowers come out everywhere in the mountain The red cuchoo flowers come out everywhere In the mountain Hey Go ahead. Go and see who they are. If they are not good people, then... Yes. Don't come. Sister, sister. - Yazi, Yazi. - Sister, sister. Yazi, Yazi. Daerhuo, you are a Red Army soldier, so do not use force, do not use force. We are the Red Army. We will not hurt you. Go back. Don't move. Comrades, don't fire. Don't come. Don't fire. You can shoot me. I will not strike back. You are blinded. This is my sister. He said this is his sister. This is my sister. He said she is his sister. I am also your sister. She is also your sister. Sister. He called you sister. I am also your sister. Sister. He called you sister. What's your name? Suoma. you are charming. Dare you touch my skirt? I will marfy you if I touch your skirt. But I can't do it now. I am a Red Army soldier. We will take the long march. Hello, Chairman Mao. Hello, Chairman. Hello. Hello, Vice-chairman Zhou. - Hello, Chairman. - Hello, Chairman Mao. Hello, Vice-chairman Zhou. Vice-chairman Zhou. General Commander Zhu. Sister, sister, Chairman Mao is here. Let's go. Hey, Rui Yazi, where are you going? I'm going to see Chairman Mao. Lao leng, let's go, too. Daerhuo, Daerhuo, hurry up. Follow us. Please may I know your name? It can only be a child who does this. Chairman. Chairman wisely commanded the army to cross the Chishui River four times. He predicts with miraculous accuracy, so he knows it's a boy who covered his eyes. We shall not call him a child any more. Our Rui Yazi has grown up. I am not a brave man. My sister and brother Daerhuo were pioneers. Not only is Zhu Meizi brave, but also her mountain song is vivid. And she can also make straw sandals. Are you comrade Daerhuo? I didn't know his name. Commanding officer, of course you didn't know. In the Red Army, we are called comrades. Daerhuo. The name sounds like a Yi comrade. The service cap is on his head and his body is covered by a "Chaerwa". He must be Daerhuo. Daerhuo is a new comrade. Only three days' service. In my opinion, the Red Army can pass through the Yi region as long as it implements the national policy of the Communist Party. Comrade Liu Bocheng and Chief Xiao Yedan drank animal blood to make an alliance as life-and-death brothers. The Red Army soldiers treat the Yi people sincerely. They will be extolled by their successors for thousands of years. Suoma! Hurry up. Stand to attention and look to the right. Stand to attention. Check the numbers. Number one platoon is all ready! Brother Changzi, I had a dream last night. Daerhuo and Suoma went out silently and hugged each other. Don't tell anyone else about this. Comrades, the counteraction head has colluded with the enemy to attack our field hospital. Let's start the rescue immediately. Sister. Open the door and surrender. If you defy the order, we will destroy all of you. Go. Lay down your arms and we'll spare your lives. Number two platoon, follow me to make a search. Come on! Where are our captured fellows? Where are our captured fellows? Hurry up. Rescue them. Comrade, did you see Zhu Meizi? Wang Zhumei. Sister Xiaolian, Sister Xiaolian. Where is my sister? Have you seen my sister? Rui Yazi. - Xiao. - I'm coming. Hurry up. Sister. Sister, sister, sister, sister. Sister. Yazi. Yazi. Yazi, Yazi. Don't do that, Yazi. Yazi, we are the Red Army. What's the last term of the Three Main Disciplines and Eight Points for Attention? Don't maltreat captives. Sister, sister. What's wrong? Zhumei. Yazi let's help your sister to put on the shoes. Zhumei... These are the straw sandals made by you. Put them on. We will go together. The road is still far. Look. The river in front of us is the Da Du River. ANSHUNCHANG But we only have three boats. Each boat only carries twenty people. To get there and back takes at least one hour. Let's count. To transport all the main forces, we will need one month. But Xue Yue's Central Army has reached Xichang. Yang Sen's Chuan Army has also reached Jinhekou of Ebian. They are only three or four days' marching behind us. Yi King Shi Dakai's army of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom was pursued and wiped out by Qing Dynasty Army and overwhelmed completely here. I heard from the local people that there are areas of mounds on the hillside over there. What are they? They are the tombs of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom soldiers who were killed in action. What shall we do, then? There is only one bridge over the Da Du River, which is thousands of miles long. We have only one way. That is to seize the Lu Ding Bridge which is about 320 miles from here to guarantee the central column crosses the river smoothly. Hurry up. Come on. Commander leng. Commander leng. The commissar needs us to occupy Lu Ding Bridge before May 29th. Tomorrow is the 29th. We have been moving quickly for 80 miles. We are still 240 miles away from the Lu Ding Bridge. This is a two-day route, but you want me to finish it in one day. Listen, this is an order of the militay committee sent by the commissar. Listen! Everybody, speed up the march! Come on. It is hard for me to move. Let me have a rest and then I will keep up with you. No, don't stop. If you stop, you can't go forward any more. Hurry! Hurry up! We have no time to cook. Please hold your own. We must get to Lu Ding Bridge before daybreak. Hurry. The people on the opposite side, listen to me. Where are you from? It's too bad. We meet enemies who are going to Lu Ding Bridge, too. You answer them because my Jiangxi accent is not good. Tell them we are also the Kuomintang Army with orders to go to the bridge. Don't shout any more. You see we are also the Kuomintang Army with orders to march, don't you? You are great! Your firebrands are bright, but I want to save some oil money for wine. Avalanche. Stand back. - The road is blocked. - Move them out of the way. Come on, all together! Yazi, it is dangerous. Commander. Yazi. Yazi. Don't shout. There are enemies on the opposite side. LUDING Yazi. Stand up. Comrades. While we are waiting for the order to attack, the Communist Pam branch will hold a swearing-in ceremony. We decide on eight comrades to join the party. Comrade Wang Rui should wait half a month before being eligible to join the party, but the branch has decided to allow him to join the party earlier. Comrade Wang Rui. This is the first time I call you comrade. Commander leng and I introduced you to the party originally. But Commander Zeng sacrificed himself to rescue you. Before swearing you in, on behalf of Commander Zeng, I ask you again. Why do you want to join the party? For the Red Army's victory. And for the liberation and freedom of poor people. What do you offer as a guarantee? My blood, my flesh, my bone and my life. Let's begin. Instructor. I have another request. Speak.
