"TIME OF FEAR" Let's go inside. C'mon, Rafa. Good morning. -Good morning. -What's up? Don't you know what day it is today? The first Sunday of our lives as paupers? No, today is Mothers' Day, silly! If you want to we can sort your room out later. Just leave it as it is. What's wrong, Rafa? Why are you treating me like this? Wake up, Ms. L?cia. Haven't you noticed that we've ended up in this hellhole? Jardim Copacabana... Do you expect me to be happy? -Is that my fault, by any chance? -It's certainly not mine! Some big things have happened in our lives, right? Your dad died, the company where he worked went bust we lost his pension. But life goes on. I'm going to the movies with Beto tonight. Yeah? Good. PIANO LESSONS Hey, Beto, whose car is this? I don't know, man. I snatched it at the shop. Is the registration document in there? -Check this out! -Holy shit! -Is it loaded? -You bet it is. Jesus! Put that shit away! Look, look... Hang on. Hi, Beto. What was that move you pulled off? Didn't you see it? From a distance. Can you do it with me? If he doesn't watch it, I'm going to do it. I pay now or later? This guy's gonna screw up... Go! Stop! No, fuck! Son of a bitch! Fuck it, man! What the fuck, man? -Are you nuts, kid? -My bad... Fuck my bad! Where is it man? The money. -You're gonna pay for this! -Hey, bro. -What's done is done, right? -What's done is done? -You win some, you lose some. -What's done is really done? But someone wins, someone else loses. Stop! -Freeze! -Put the gun down. -Put the gun down! -Put it down! -Put the gun down. -You're busted! -Come on! -Put it down! Just a minute... Sir, there must have been some mistake? My son went to the movies. Ma'am, he committed a crime in front of over 200 witnesses. I'll talk to you later. -Can he spend the night at home? -What? Can he spend the night at home and present himself tomorrow? You don't get it. Your son killed a person. He was caught red handed. He isn't going to sleep at home for years. But I'll let you see him quickly. Jo?o, go get the boy. CIVIL POLICE New blood, guys! Cutie. Shut up! There's a new kid in town. And he's gonna get stuck in here. It's a full house, but there's always room for one more. -Come in, pretty boy. -Get out of the way. You're gonna die, man. Can you see anyone wearing shoes in here, playboy? Get outta here. Go on! We take turns to sleep. There's no room for everyone to lie down. You'll sleep in the day. Good times, eh ?ngela? Yeah. Here. Thanks. -I'll pay you back. -Don't worry about it. And the attorney? Expensive, but is he good at least? -I don't know.. -L?cia, wake up! Get a grip of your life! What do you plan to do? I'm a piano teacher, I'll carry on teaching. No, forget that. You're a law graduate. Get studying, try and pass to be a district attorney... public prosecutor, whatever. The defendant is a good boy. He reacted when he saw his friend being brutally murdered. The evidence is undeniable! Dozens of people witnessed the scene. He was caught red handed! He committed several crimes: vehicle theft, bearing arms, and murder. I condemn the defendant Rafael Montechi... to 8 years of imprisonment. Murderer! Murderer! 8 years? After completing 1/6 of the sentence... if he has good behavior... he can be transferred to a minimum security facility. Excuse me. I can see that you guys know the rules around here. Respect me and you'll be ok. Hold on! Let's keep an eye on those guys, because they want to take us down. He's history. Nobody leaves! Over to you, Chico! Comrades! It's the Capital Command in charge now! We're here! We are the power and we want our rights... that are being crushed in this concentration camp! The majority here have been sentenced... but aren't transferred to the prison because we can't pay a lawyer... and the government forgot about us! They think that poor people are garbage... so they stick us in this garbage heap! We've come to change all that. Here are the rules: Brother won't rob brother. Convict won't rat on convict. Betrayal is death, no mercy. The government will reap what it's sown. -They're gonna get fucked over! -This is our message. You got it? Peace, justice, freedom! Peace! Justice! Freedom! Excuse me, excuse me. Please, can you help me? I'm an attorney. I just need information. The orders are clear. Calm down, the rebellion is over. It's all right, ok? Open up for me, please. Hey, colleague! Colleague! Yes. -You have a client in here? -My son. -You're a mother. -Mother and attorney. And you want news about your son. -Yes. -He's fine. The rebellion is over. Only 2 "lice" died. What? 2 old prisoners. Of course neither of them was your son. -Are you a police officer? -Me? No. I'm a colleague. Attorney. "Electro lucidior". What's your name? -L?cia, L?cia Montechi. -If I can be of any help, Dr. L?cia. Pedr?o, Tirso, Chico, Z?. The guys are excited with the arrival of the big bosses, Dr. D?vila. It's as if Ronaldinho has come to play on their team. Something like that, yes. All right. Get the "star players" together. We're gonna have a pre-match talk. I'm not gonna stand here preaching to you, but we got rules. And I hope you all follow them... so that everything carries on the way it has to be: nice and calm. There'll be no problem at all, sir. The food here is good. Medical care and legal assistance by the law. Intimate visit guaranteed. Nobody will humiliate our families. There'll be no problem at all. Look here, son: I'm not promising anyone paradise. But you don't want this place to become hell. Do you, Warden? Hell for who? For us, sir. Who else? But... But Mrs. Z?lia, she is talented. Don't you think it's worth keeping at it? But it's not that far. I know. Yes, I understand. All right. Thank you, you too. DR. VANDA, ATTORNEY LA RUBIA BEAUTY CENTER Good morning. Can I help you? No, I think I'm in the wrong place. Thank you. -Hello, dear! -Hello, Dr. Vanda... How are you? No, forget the doctor and call me Ginger. We're colleagues. I really wanted to talk about my son. Of course, let's talk. But I have a meeting first. Meanwhile, why don't you sort your hair out? I think it's about time, don't you? Pati, tidy her up, please. Go on, L?cia. It's on the house. I'm taking notes. Crack... 400. Blow... 150. Shit man, it's slow! We need to get things moving. -Put Coutinho on the line. -What's up HD? Avar? is all right. But Presidente Bernardes and Taubat? not all right. But, what d'you expect, playing around on the job. Coutinho, no more of these 50-gram deals. Orders from above. Only half kilo deals. The risk is the same and the profit is zero. Do it! Hey, Tiana. How much we pulled in? I'm still summing up. Who's the lady there? You gotta be shitting me, Ginger! Bringing in people we don't even know. -She's a good person. -Says who? Me. My woman's intuition is highly refined, something you lack. As her presence bothers you, I'll take her out. Do you think he'll get his sentence reduced if he has good behavior? -I need to get a good attorney. -A good attorney or a terrible judge. Sometimes it's quicker to get a terrible judge. -Where has he been transferred to? -No, he's still there. Grab my folder back there. There's a list of the transfers, have a look. -This? -That's the one. Rafael. How did you get hold of this? "Necessitas caret lege". Necessity is not subject to law. Have you got anything scheduled for right now? D?vila, the police needs to change the protocol. It's blood and press. Efficient police plus dead gangster equals votes. Come in. Dr. D?vila, this is Tirso. Chief of Police Raul. You're parole is up, Tirso? That's right. -Just depends on my report. -The Warden wants to help you. He says you even want to be rehabilitated. Do I? If you don't, he might change his mind. I just want to get out of here, sir. My wife is pregnant... I want to see my son's birth. You will see your son's birth. But first I need you to help me outside. -So what's it gonna be, Tirso? -You're with me, you're with God. Tell your attorney to file the request. Name of the inmate, relationship and prison. -Piranh?o. -No, the name of the prisoner. It's Reginaldo Gomes, my husband, he's in Piranh?o. Give her one. Are getting all this, love? Next. Name of the inmate, relationship and prison. Luis Carlos Souza, my husband, he's in Avar?. Okay, give her one. Thank you. L?cia, help this girl take notes otherwise we'll be here all day. Carlos, father, Hortol?ndia. Eduardo Pinto, son... Avar?. Geraldo... Hortol?ndia. What's up, sister... The government does nothing for the prisoners or their families. But the Party does. It really is a help. -Have you been practicing law long? -I graduated, but never practiced. I thought as much. What do you do for a living? I'm a piano teacher. I mean, I was. I've got no students right now. -Do you need some work? -Yes, I really do. -I know what it's like. -Might you have some work for me? There's always something. -You're visiting your son on Sunday? -Yes. If you want to do the favor of taking a delivery to a client of mine... A paid favor. -I'll take it. -Great. Excuse me. What's up, playboy? I'm in a sorting cell and wanted to know if... You think it sucks. Got any money? -Got any fucking money or not? -How much? For $500 I'll have a nice cubicle, with good board to sleep on. -I'll get the money, don't worry. -I'm trusting you. Xis?o, he's going into your cubicle. -Nice... -Hey, playboy: the cash is for the party. -Move. -Thank you. You're rich, aren't you, Racer? -What's eating you, man? -Copped it doing some racing. Big strong machine, you're the son of a lawyer... You're not poor anyway. -Who told you that? -The party, man. They know everything, do the research. My mother never worked as a lawyer, dude. She'll have to start now. To give you some comfort in here. RENT A LIPSTICK PERFUME - ONE BUCK A SPURT Just one spurt, my love. And you, darling, you gonna use all that lipstick or what? STATE PRISON You may go. Next. Name of inmate. Rafael Montechi. I'm his mother. Follow me, please. INSPECTION Put your bag over there, please. Take off your clothes, please. -What? -Take off your clothes... and step up onto the mirror, please. This is your first time? Shoes too! Crouch down! Okay! You can get dressed and leave. Crouch down. Get dressed. All right, miss? Was it you who brought Dr. Vanda's delivery? Mom... I think about that night all the time. Beto, the girl... I can hardly sleep. I can't get it out my head. I keep seeing it over again. My life changed in 15 seconds, forever. You know what, son? That girl died... and that's forever too. I would like to ask something, Rafa. Please, Rafa, don't do anything wrong in here, don't mess up. Otherwise you'll lose the right to any benefit. I know, but let me tell you something. When I got here I was put in a sorting cell. A horrible place, I couldn't stand staying there. Yes, so what? So to get out I promised to pay. And in here, if you don't keep your word... How much? 500. I know you're broke, but I dunno, sell my stuff. I'll sort it out. Hang on in there. I'll do everything to get you out of here. -Excuse me, Chico. -What's up, Tirso? -A little gift for you. -Open it. Ended when you entered the party? Of course, it was the only way to help the prisoners. But, just so you know, now me and Chico are just friends. Good friends. He trusts me entirely. But L?cia, come on! I want to show you the night life in Foz. A night of pleasure. He's gone to get a friend for you. Game. No more bets. Red 12! L?cia, what a wonderful night! I'll tell you something: Foz is much better than Miami! I don't know why you didn't go for it, that kid was gorgeous! I didn't feel like it. The Professor would never find out. At least, not through me. What are you talking about, what through you? L?cia, you can't hide love. It's the talk of the town in every S?o Paulo prison! -Front page news! -What? This school love affair: the Professor for the piano teacher. When we get back, I'll take you to a classical music concert, ok? Ah, only if the conductor is worth it. But what are you doing at this time still dressed like that? You had a good night, but mine wasn't bad either: I won US$ 5,000 on roulette. You're kidding! I'm gonna pay the best lawyer in the world for my son. Sometimes it's quicker to get a terrible judge, I already told you. Well, 10 o'clock at the bank. Isn't this business gonna get me into trouble? What are you talking about? We're not harming anyone at all. It's nothing different to what goes on in this country every day. We'll sort this out and go back to S?o Paulo. Holy shit! First class material, beautiful! -Can you set it up today? -No. I'll need to load it up first. That sucks, HD. So load it up now, the people need this quick. Not today, but tomorrow the new HD soap opera will be on air. -The Clone! -Let's get to work, HD! Stop playing around 'cause I've got better things to be doing! The day I sold this piano to you was one of the worst days of my life. -So today must be one of the best? -Yes. -Are you working? -Yes, as a lawyer, working hard. -When can you deliver it? -This afternoon, how's that? -The guys gave me this job. -Here, Xis... I'm busy. C'mon, man. -What is that? -Read it. You read better than me. "We are not a criminal organization or faction." It's the party manifesto, man! "We are not a Utopia, but rather a transformation into a new philosophy: Peace, justice and freedom!" You're gonna make 100 copies of this for me, ok? 100 to give out to the guys. But carry on reading, carry on. "As long as there are children who starve to death... sleep on the street, will have no chance to learn to read and write"... Wait on, that's wrong. What do you mean it's wrong?! The party wrote it, man. It says "children who will have". It should say "won't have". "As long as there are children who starve to death... sleep on the street, have no chance to learn to read and write"... -Understand? Now it's right. -You'll copy it the way it is, bro. What, don't you want the children to read and write? But you're gonna leave it wrong? The party is gonna take over the country, got it? So what, what's that gotta do with the grammar? We can change the grammar and what is wrong will be right. Have a smoke 'cause you're too tense for my taste. That's right, like that. You need to help the baby. Push. Push. That's it. A prisoner who says he doesn't think about escaping is lying. Where were you 5 years ago? 5 years ago? My husband had just died. 10. 10? I traveled to Rio de Janeiro to sell a house of my family's. My son went with me, we went to the beach. It was great. 15? 15? I dunno. I was 25, I thought I would be happy forever. For all that time I was in here. And I'm gonna stay another 10 years. If I could I'd stay here with you for the rest of my life. No. You're going to leave and do me a favor. Something important. Alright? And so you are now representing Jos? Adailton. Yes, the Professor. And what a "school", ma'am. What a "school"! But let's get on with it. I'm here to talk with you 'cause he wants to hear... news about how his case is going. It's true. I promised him a legal maneuver. It's a complicated case. He sent me a great deal of documentation. But at the moment it's impossible. Dr. Pereira, he is really counting on your help. He is requesting a transfer. -You must know that already. -Yes. -But they killed a judge, remember? -Yes. A tragedy. With serious consequences. Please, return this documentation to him. Tell him I am sorry, but I can't help. The bus will be in Campinas in 2 days... with the guns and everything in order. In S?o Paulo I'll have some cars to bring you here. The agreement is no killing. What killing, Tirso? It's just a robbery. I arrest your partners, the press reports it, that's all I want. But there'll be no holes in the plan? Of course not. Hold on to the money. You come in your car, with the van behind. Is that right? It'll all work out fine, Tirso. Shit, mom, where've you been? 3 visits without coming. Son, I couldn't make it. I'm working, I had to travel. Didn't you get the things I sent? You didn't tell me anything. You've been traveling all this time? Forget about that, quit asking me questions. I'm here now, aren't I? New clothes. You could bring me a cell phone. -No way! -Why not? Just a shitty one. It's not the money. I don't want you doing anything wrong in here. To get you outta here, your behavior has to be exemplary... get it? More than you can imagine. Don't be like this. I brought you some chocolate. Stop being silly, take it son. We're nearly there, bro. Fine, man! Now what? Get out or stay put? Wait up, brother. The cars are arriving. Do whatever you want. What's up, Tirso, can we go? What's going on, Tirso? You wait here, all right? I'm getting off to see what's going on. -What's up? -All right? And the guys, still asleep? What the fuck's going on, Tirso? It's a set up! These guns are useless! They fucked us over, the bullets are blanks! It's game over. I'm gonna have to disappear for a while, they played me like a fool. Listen, this is what you're gonna do. Do exactly what I tell you. Get that money, you know that's there? That's right, you're gonna take all that money... take it all. Go to your mom's house. I'll meet you there. All right? You're a warrior. And look after our boy. I love you too. I love you so much. -May God be with you. -Our reporter... live at the location, with Chief of Police Raul Soares... -who commanded the police action. -We were granted... court authorization to record the conversations... and discovered that they were planning a big bank robbery. We followed them here, they reacted upon being called under arrest. Unfortunately there was a confrontation. The fact is that this preventive action... was a hard blow to the criminal organization. -Can I pay you in dollars? -I'll accept anything but Cuban Pesos. Thanks. It really helped me out. I received some late payments from Juca's pension. Are they paying in dollars now? Good. You're not into anything dodgy, are you, sister? ?ngela, what kind of dodgy business could a piano teacher get into? I dunno. If the police were as terrible as they say... the gangsters would be drinking beer on the beach. -Who's that? -The king of estate agents. He's crazy about your sister. Hello? Shit, Marquinho, they set me up. Tirso, Tirso... I'll explain, the bosses will understand. -Tirso, we're here to listen to you. -What's up? Chief... -What's going on? Who's on the line? -A meeting. Pedr?o and another 10. -And? -They're judging Tirso. -He's on the line. Listen up. -I won't deny it. Yes, I arranged it. They got the guy already? No good trying to run away. If he ran they'd get someone from his family. I needed to do that bank to raise some cash. I dunno how the cops turned up there. That wasn't supposed to happen, they fucked me over. You fuck my partners and then come along with this story? -That's Pedr?o. -You were trying to fuck me over! You and who else? You and the Professor? No, I was solo on this. -It was just me. -Have you contacted the operator? Yes. -He pinpointed Tirso's whereabouts? -They said he's in radio area NQ10. -Shit! And? -It's a 5 km area in the West Zone. Shit, those guys are really trying to help. Disconnect that shit! Turn it up! I never expected this from you, man. Take him out. I think so. Everyone knows the punishment for treason. Take him out. -I think so too. -It's decided, take him out. Fuck me! They killed Tirso. Jerk! I'll be back. Ginger, what's happened? I got some terrible news. Terrible, terrible. Can you tell me? You should know: They killed the Professor. What? They've just killed him. I have to go. It was the couple that "did in" the Professor. I thought as much. They made up in their minds that he set up the bus thing with Tirso. To demoralize the command. Pedr?o's gone mad. Now he's gonna come after me. What now? We need to put the fire out. You sort things out there, I'll sort them out here. And hand that dynamite over to the police for free. And more... I need a big package, live. In 50s. Bye. What is it, kid? The job's done, auntie. Pedr?o! Visit's over. Pedr?o! You called me in to see a corpse? But this is Pedr?o, Secretary. -The leader. -Former leader... of at least 50 thousand inmates. Some say 140 thousand. And who did this to him? Who were his enemies? Friends. Secretary, the leadership is changing. Or has changed already. They're gonna want to show power at the first opportunity. -A rebellion? -You remember the last one? 47 prisons rebelling in S?o Paulo. But we can't let that happen! It's election year. No, don't worry. No way! And to think he did a thousand push-ups a day. Now he can get some rest. This is what you're going to do: take these checks and cash them, one bank to the next. Rodap? will go with you. You want me to deliver the money to him? No, give the money to Z? on visiting day. Rodap? is going just to make sure. The city is so violent right now. My son would love this car. He drives so well. How much of your casino winnings are left over? About US$ 3,000. Why? It's Mothers' Day soon. There'll be day release for the prisoners. But Rafael doesn't have that right yet. If you want, for about US$ 2,000... I can arrange a day release for you, I mean, for him. You can? Almost sure. Dr. Ginger still has a bit of prestige. What's up? -All right? -Fine, and you? Fine. -I have some great news! -What? It's Mothers' Day soon. I'm getting a day release for you. -No way, mom? -It's true. -But how are you gonna get that? -Leave it with me. So... What will you want to do? Nothing. I dunno. Anything. See the street. Eat properly. Sleep on a real bed. I dunno, mom. Anything. What's wrong? It's nothing. You're the most important thing in my life, son. So, what's the big news this time? I'll show you what the news is. The guys were going to blow up the stock exchange. That was the plan. The order came from inside the prison. -How did you find the car? -Anonymous report. Fuck me. I'm gonna call a press conference. The people need to hear about our victories. And what about you, D?vila? What are you gonna do in the prison? Leave it with me. Come on, move it! Stay in line! Stay in line! Get in the car. Get in there and shut up. POLICE Let's lock it. Let's go! Lock it all! So? Get them all out? The last lot just left. They wanted me for dinner. I'll have them for lunch. I'm being transferred. I don't know where to! But it's high security. About 100 from here, but they told me over 500 altogether. Yeah, just like that. Let me tell you... Listen up, Ginger. We won't be able to talk anymore. So listen. Send out a message: A blanket alert... To everyone. Rebellion on Mothers' Day. Got it? Blanket, to the whole system. Leave it with me. HD, call Ti?oz?o and Z?. All right. Ti?oz?o... 9118-4855. Ti?oz?o, HD. Ginger wants to talk with you. Ti?oz?o? Ginger. Listen up... they've sent 500 heads to high security. All the leaders. This is the message: Smash up the prison on Mothers' Day. You sort it out up there. What's up, Z?. HD here. Ginger wants to talk with you. -Now! -Z?? What's up? All right? What's up, Russo? Hey, Xis?o! I can hardly believe it! You can't go off today, man. There's a message we gotta deliver. -Come on, I'm waiting for my mom. -We need you, Racer. There's some noise going on in the pavilions. Some strange talk. They're talking about retaliation against the transfer of the leaders. Saying they're gonna bring the city to a standstill. -Who is? -The party. Sometimes it seems like you don't think, son. I stuck all the leaders under high security. I isolated all of them. KEEP OUT Let me fucking speak! Did you see what they pulled on the brothers there? So, it's on Mothers' Day. Everyone in the system break everything. Smash it all up, bro. That's it, we're in it together. Peace! Stay alert and let your people know. Just hold on and let me explain this shit. Everyone is gonna call. The message is: everyone in the system, smash everything up. And whoever's on the street... fill the cops with lead. Let them have it, no mercy. Anyone on the street who don't help is gonna be taken out too. Got it? Get calling. What's up? All good. We're on the way. Yeah, I know where it is. We're nearly there. We're gonna pick up some guys downtown. Lend me your phone. I've gotta sort something out. Leave your old lady outta this. After the job you talk with her. There they are. What's up, dude? I'm Xis, this is Racer. What's up? It's in S?o Rafael, know where it is? -Leave it with me. -Let's go. Sons of bitches! Bullet on the pigs! Let's go! Move it, move it! Sons of bitches! It's the war! Tell the Chief. What's up, Terer?? Give them what's for? Any of ours get hurt? Good job, keep it up. The message is: a party in each district! Get out! Everybody out! Come on! Let's go! Let's go! Let's go! Come on, let's go! Get the fuck in! SPECIAL EDITION A wave of violence has taken hold of S?o Paulo tonight. Gangsters are attacking police stations... and all and any police target throughout the city. Banks are also being attacked, plundered and set on fire. Up to now, 10 military police officers, 3 civil police officers... and 2 prison guards have been killed. Ginger, it's me, L?cia. I really need to talk with you. Please call me. They sprang us by surprise. I counted at least 12 cartridges. Hello, son. What's up, mom? -Jeez, honey. -All right, mom? Where have you been? I was going out my mind! -Let me see my room. -I organized it. Did you like it? What's wrong? -Mom, I'm not staying, ok? -What? -I'm not staying. -Why not? -'Cause I can't. -Where are you going? -I've got things to sort out. -What d'you mean? -I've gotta sort things out. -What's going on? Mom, I'll be back. I'll be back, trust me! Mom, stop! Stop, mom. Rafa! So sir, how's Saturday in S?o Paulo? Nice and calm, just like your cell. -There's nothing happening. -That's how it should be. Isn't it? THIS IS NOT A RIOT. WE JUST WANT OUR RIGHTS RESPECTED The negotiation... -Dr. D?vila... -What is it, Rubinho? -The press wants to talk to you. -I'm not talking to anyone. -But you should talk to them. -Be reasonable. Hold them back there. You think we're just playing around? If you don't do what we're asking for... this is gonna happen to everyone! Then we're getting outta here... and you're gonna give us what we're demanding! Fuck it all up! Hey, auntie, it's beautiful! They are doing one hell of a job. But it could be better. Paran? and Mato Grosso have to rebel! Let's squeeze the government, see if they've got balls. News just in that 25,000 prisoners... have rebelled in 24 prisons... taking 130 hostages in S?o Paulo state. Very good! Let's go live now with our reporter Julio Moura. Shit! If they tell you to stop, pretend you're gonna stop, but don't! Go, Racer! Go! Go, Racer! Nobody'll catch us, man! Nobody! Go, go, go. Nice one, Racer! He's history. I can't believe it, man! Go, Racer! Holy crap! Nice one! I gotta admit, you're the fucking business, Racer! I've called you here 'cause I honestly don't know what else to do. This has never happened in S?o Paulo. I've done my bit, I locked up the leaders. I just don't know why the police are waiting to act. D?vila, fuck you! -What the...? -I demand respect! Fuck you! You set off this bomb and threw it in our lap. You control your prisoners and leave the streets to us. I can see how that shit's going down. Let's stop all this bickering which won't lead us anywhere. The situation is completely out of control. I've thought about the options and the obvious conclusion is: let's negotiate with the prisoners. -I disagree. -You disagree? 297 gangster attacks, 23 dead cops... 100 buses in flames, 70 prisons rebelling and you disagree? Public in panic, the government against the wall. And he disagrees! Surely he must have a better proposal than negotiate. Tell us what your secret is. I'm going to request a plane and we'll go and talk to them. D?vila... me and you. Too right. We hold back in the prisons and go all out on the streets. I'LL BE RIGHT BACK. IF I'M OUT CALL ME OR AUNTIE ?NGELA. Our people are dying, your people are dying. And in the middle of all this it's the people who are suffering. -Today's Mothers' Day. -I don't have a mother, sir. I'm not here to joke. We're here to try and sort out this situation... as quickly as possible. This never needed to have started, sir. Why did they transfer us like that, for no reason? That's not the point anymore. Now you're here. You too. Come for a day out? Let's make this short and sweet: do you speak for everyone else? Nobody's a mute in here, sir. Here we think and decide everything together. What the fuck do you want? 80 buses have been burned in S?o Paulo state... since the start of the attacks last Friday. Animals! And the police does nothing! On Mothers' Day! Total number of attacks: 251. The attacks were advanced by the release... of 12 thousand inmates... They put 12 thousand brute on the streets after us?! -Idiots! -They're not all brutes, ?ngela. I'm not talking about Rafa. You don't need to defend him. Talking of which, was he released too? No, he wasn't. He doesn't have that right. -Did he call you? -Me? No... No, just that I told him to call you, to send you a kiss on Mothers' Day. You see, they keep the good boy locked up. -And the brutes are let out. -You don't know what you're saying. L?cia, please! Are you gonna defend these guys? Sometimes it seems like you've lost all sense of right and wrong. -Me? -Yeah. What did I say, ?ngela? You spouting off with a vengeance. What's your problem? Did someone invade your place, set your car on fire? What is it? My problem is that I'm going to lose $10,000 because of all this! What? I was going to sell an apartment to a foreigner who's leaving tomorrow. Now he's too scared to even leave the hotel. You're worried because you're going to lose money. Speaking of money, where did you get the money to buy new clothes? -None of your business! -To travel... It's none of your business! Do you ask these questions to your clients? Do you ask them if they're honest, if they pay all their taxes... where their money comes from? -You're out your mind, L?cia! -No, no I'm not. Not yet! I just don't want to be anyone's judge. Sir, this is the boy from the telephone operator. At last. I'm an employee, Chief. I'll do what you tell me. I'm not the owner of the company. Let's get to work. -Call that girlfriend of Pedr?o's. -She's vanished. Fuck it. Risk it. It's beetroot juice. You're not gonna change it are you? Sit tight, 'cause I'll only be back tonight. Hold on, you forgot the key. I'll take a cab. It's hard to park there. -I need at least one minute. -Holy fuck! Wait, gimme that! Yes? Hey, buddy, where's Tiana? Tiana's out of town. She left her phone here. -Listen, call back in a week. -We're out here without the message. Tiana usually sends us the word, now we're all here... seeing it all kicking off... and everyone giving the cops what for. And we're out in the cold. We need to know the message, but Tiana usually sends it us. I know. But who am I talking to? Shit, brother! It's Figurino, from the West Zone. Actually it was Tiana who brought me into the Party. I know that politics took out Pedr?o, but that's life. Now it's time for the leadership to take hold, we're there with them. I want to know what the message is, so I can let the guys know. You don't know what the message is? It's to hit the cops hard, all the bastards. The message is all out war, man. 50 seconds. Long enough? -There's a lot of money, Chief. -Collect it all. So China, we haven't got all night! You're gonna talk or what? -Fucking talk! -My memory is real shitty. Your memory is real shitty? I'll help you out. Now talk! -Stop! Please, stop! -One number per minute! I want one number per minute, you faggot! -Now fucking talk! -Stop it, man! -Sons of bitches! -What happened? How did they fucking get here?! Let's go! Let's get outta here. HD has already started talking. Jerk! You can't trust nobody. Nobody. -And you, what were you doing there? -I've got nothing to do with this! I'm here cause Rafael has disappeared. -I need your help, that's all. -It's me that needs your help now. I need to see some people, you're gonna take me. Stay cool 'cause this area is ours. Open the window. -Where's Careca? -I'll take you to him. Let's go L?cia, come with me. -Careca! -Is that you, cousin? -Where are you, boy? -I'm coming. Are you very busy? Judging a guy. I gave him an order, and he did nothing. -Did nothing? -Nothing at all. A dead beat. Listen up, buddy, you remember article 7 of the Party Statute? I'm not from the party, what statute? "Anyone in freedom, who is well structured... but forgets to contribute to the brothers in prison... will be condemned to death without forgiveness." -What the...? -Take him out! -What the...? -Take him out! Now! -You heard, right? -I beg you! -Anything else, cousin? -Money. -The "alert" has stopped business. -It's an emergency, Careca. -I've sold nothing. -That sucks, eh? Forget it. -That's all I've got. -No, thank you. No. I'm driving. Let's go, L?cia. Fucking hell! -Where are we going now? -Your house. I need a clean phone. Shit, Racer. I thought you lived better than that. Is your old lady a lawyer or not? She graduated. But she wanted to be an artist. And it didn't work out. Why not? I dunno, just didn't. It's fucking hard. I wanted to be a racing car driver... and look at me now. Can I say something? -You're better off like this. -Yeah? Of course. If you were a driver for Ferrari, you'd be rich... but it'd be just for you. But now... you're driving for something bigger, to do the revolution, man! -D'you believe in that, Xis? -Sure thing, man. If I don't believe in it, what will I do with my life? I'm with you. But I wanna stay alive. I don't wanna kill anyone. So, that's it? Nothing else? -That's it. -Done. Now, how long before this madness in the streets and prisons ends? -One hour? -Are you kidding, sir? Are we making a deal or not? Sir, to do it with the speed you want... only if you give us the national radio and television network. This is a joke. Sir, it's not that simple to talk with 200 thousand people. But we can do it. -Say the end of the manifesto. -Shit, Xis, right now? -Just fucking say it! -Gimme a break, Xis. -You memorized it... -I forgot. My ass. Say it. Our war cry will spread... across the whole country. If we have to love, we will love; if we have to kill, we will kill. Peace, justice and freedom! Racer! Freeze, freeze! Officer! Turn that light off. Where are you going? I'm going to prepare some food. Shit! Terer?, please. Terer?! Sorry, fuck! Hello? Call Terer?, please. This is Ginger. All right. At fucking last, I've been trying to call you. That's right, a monumental fuck up! They raided our house. I've got no idea! Did you want me to go over and ask the cops?! Forget it. Trouble is: I need the money. And I need it tonight. I have to get the hell outta here. I'll keep calling from here. It's a safer line. Ok, ok, I'll wait... Agreed. But do what I said, ok? -I'm tired, I'm going to my room. -No, sit down. We need to talk. It's about your son. He's with our people. Ginger, why did you get my son involved in this? -It wasn't me. The party needed him. -Why did you do this?! Lower your voice. What is it? You think your son is any different? He's gonna get out of prison and lead a decent life, he's gonna work. "Emori risu". You have to laugh! He never found a job before killing and you think he will now? -And that's impossible now anyway. -Why? After what he's done tonight, he'll serve at least another 10 years. So, tell me: will his life be better outside the party? Ginger... You're a demon. Not me. I didn't invent the world, Miss L?cia. It was given to me like this. Speak. You didn't get it? Fuck me, Terer?! Ok, ok, I'll wait. While you're at it check something out for me. I want news on a prisoner who went out on the day release. His name's Rafa. They call him Racer. He went out with Xis?o. Check it out and call me. A brother is gonna find out. Look, L?cia, I'm sorry. It's this story with HD has really shaken me. I took that kid off the street. Right off the street. He slept on the sidewalk. Every time I drove by that traffic light he was there. His eyes glowing, I could see he was a bright one. I sorted a home out for him, school... He grew up, I paid for him to study this and that. I gave him an opportunity in life, understand? He even studied English. And now... If he gave them my number, he must have given them my address, too! I can't go home. I'm fucked. Tonight it's make or break for me. Talk to me! Right. It's about your son. When was that? Ok, yes, all right. Stay calm. He has been hurt in an incident in the East Zone, but he's okay. -They've taken him to a hospital. -I'm going there now. You won't be able to see him. 66? I'm worried 'cause there's no money yet. I'm going. We're letting everyone know that all units under our control... will be back to normal at 9 a.m. But our brothers have to be sunbathing in Venceslau. And they have to normalize service with the lawyers. And there can't be any riot police in any prison. That's right. And stop all the parties on the streets. That's right, bro. Take care, bye. Good evening. I'd like information about a boy, Rafael Montechi. -Rafael Montechi. He's here. -Can I see him? -Negative. -I'm his mother. He's under custody, ma'am. Can I talk with you for a minute? In private? Please. Speak up. -I want to get my son out of here. -I thought it was just to see him. Listen... Don't you want to think about it? Ma'am, are you aware of what you're proposing? Yes. Put your money away. This isn't how it works. Even if I agreed, there are colleagues, the doctor, the nurse... There's enough for everyone. Okay. Here's the deal: that amount there is just to think about it. I'll need more for the others and even more to get him out of here. Agreed. Come back tomorrow night. My shift is at 10 p.m. Bring it in Reais. This Monday morning began with chaos in S?o Paulo. The bus companies kept their fleets in the depots... liberating the circulation of only 30% of their vehicles... the minimum legal requirement. By mid morning... Following 3 days of riots the rebellions... in 46 S?o Paulo prisons are over... where the prisoners held 237 hostages. The authorities deny that a deal was struck with the criminals. I can assure everyone that there was no agreement at all. In Tr?s Lagoas children and women were released. In Corumb?, 7 women were still being held hostage by early evening. Terer?, who ordered to stop the rebellion? And why didn't you tell me this before, you jerk? I want to know everything, before everyone. Okay, but we can't go easy on them. Call that journalist friend of yours. Tell her that we're going to bomb the airport. Yes, the fucking airport, the City airport. Tell her. Okay. What about the money? Okay, I'll call you later. Excuse me, what's going on? Haven't you heard? Gangsters took control of the city. The government has imposed a curfew. Everyone's going home. No, no. Please, sir... I need to exchange some dollars. Sorry ma'am, I've closed. Please. One for one. One dollar for one real. Please, US$ 20,000. -One for one? -US$ 20,000, one for one. -Now what? -The city's at a standstill. Rumors flying around everywhere. I know, but what about the attacks? They kept their side of the deal? Perfectly. -What's the final score? -43 of ours died. 22 military police, 6 civil police, 3 city guards, 8 prison guards. 71 of theirs, so far. But the game is still on. -What's the situation on the streets? -Not good, Gabriel. Despite the Security Secretary denying information... that there were bombs planted at the domestic and international airports... and metro stations, panic has taken hold of the city. 12 malls have closed... as well as the street shops. With everyone trying to get home at the same time, S?o Paulo is experiencing the biggest gridlock in its history. Get them! Get them! Freeze, freeze! -Did you recognize them, sir? -Did I fuck. But anyone running from me at this time of night... is an enemy. Let's go, the night's young. Fuck me, Terer?! Fuck! Carry on like this and you're gonna turn me over to the cops! How come you haven't got the fucking money?! How am I supposed to carry on with the cops all over me? -Calm down, where are you? -I'm here at Racer's mom's house. The Professor's girl. She's the one who's got the Professor's money. Everyone knows. -What did you say? -That lawyer gave it to her. -Who said so? -You can check. It's all there. -Are you sure? -A briefcase full of dollars. I'm gonna check it out. What everyone had been expecting since the start... of the wave of violence in S?o Paulo has now happened. Following the savage criminal attacks... the police reaction has gone out of control. The number of suspected dead has risen to 93. The police has confirmed that among those... there are some without any criminal record... but deny having abused their power. It has not given any information on the location of the deaths... during supposed confrontations with the police. He's coming. What's this? What's going on? It's the best I could do. Where's the rest? Follow the ambulance. Subtitles: Arigon Mom. What? Where are we going? I don't know. I'm hungry. CAPTIONS BY VIDEOLAR
