Though this guy, his name is Jimmy Gordon, he came to offer me a job. That could pay me a lot of money in a very short time. His offer was so convincing. - How much are you talking about? - 90,000 US dollars per week. - Did you take it? - No, I didn't. - I had to discuss with my wife and we agreed not to take it. - What? You crazy? - Why? - Who on these earth can refuse such amount of money per week? - Can you ask what kinda job was it? - I don't care. You and your wife are crazy. - Can you ask please? - Ask what? - What kinda job? - Okay. What is it? - That psychopath wanted to fuck my wife every Sunday for three months in front of me. - What? - And the reason he wanted me to be there he wanted me to record them. - Hell no. What kinda guy is that. - I don't know. He said he wanted to do that for fun. - Shit. Why are you telling me all this? - I was thinking if I could take the deal, I wouldn't be here. I could be somewhere in Miami spending my money. You know? - That's crazy. - No, it's not. Imagine where would you be, if you wouldn't be here? That wasn't there. - What? - Be careful. - It's empty. - No way. What does it open? - I don't know. Pen, a key? What does it mean? This might be our way out. There must be a door somewhere. Look, there's a number. - 302. - Maybe a room number? - Or street number or something? - Then what? - How many are these? - So you want me to? Okay, I can do that. - Does this number means something to you? - No, nothing. - What are these? Yes. - What are you doing? - What do you think. We got a birthday messages from these balloons. We got to find something else. - Okay, let's do this. - Hey, come look at this. What language is this? - I have no idea. Key. Where is the key? Give me the key. - Could be a bomb. - Remote?

There is no way out. - Fuck you. Do you think I'm joking? - No. I don't think you're joking. But I think you don't understand me, when I say there's no way out. - Now make me understand. - I don't think you'll understand. - See, I told you he was not gonna say anything. - No, I would tell everything but I said, I don't think if you understand. - Show us the fucking door. - Or what?

Did you kill them? - No. I didn't kill them. - And what do you mean when you say there's nothing else out there? - You, you, me and everything in here is all what we got. Out there there's nothing else. - You think you're very clever but I want to show you you are not. - You see, that's what I was talking about you would not understand me. - You be playing us all this time you think we gotta believe anything you gotta say just like that. - Yes, I was. But now I don't wanna play with you no more. But if I were you, I would say let's play this game again and again. - Well you wanna play a game? - What are you doing? - What do you think I'm doing? Man if you kill him, we can't get out of here. - I know what I'm doing. This thing is not even working. It's not working. Oh, no, man. Hey. Hey, come on. Come on, man. Hey, stay with me. Hey, Simon. Hey. Come on, man. Hey. - Wait, wait, wait. Before you do anything, I'll show you how to bring him back. Okay? My name is Dr. Benson, a scientist and the public health community advisory. 10 years ago there was outbreak of pandemic disease cause by the viruses that killed a larger number of people in a very short time. By that time I was a doctor in the New York City Hospital. I've been doing research on finding a cure or vaccine, but I didn't succeed. And no one did it. Five years later, I found you and Simon you are among of the people who have very strong immune system that can survive in this viruses. I took you in my lab and we have been hiding for five years while I was working on finding vaccine, I discovered something unique in you. You are different. - How? - You can't die. - What? - Yes. When I was doing the first test I failed and you die for the first time. By the moment you die, everything changed. And time reset to 24 hours back. - How is it possible? - I've been asking myself that question for two years now without answers. I know you must be confused. So do I. But believe me out there, there's nothing else. Everything and everyone died. - You are lying. I knot to my wife and Simon too. - I was playing. I created those voices. It was part of the game. To make you feel that there's world out there, but you and Simon have never had a family. - That looked possible. - Yes it is. - I remember I have a wife. - No, that is not your memory. We have been playing this game for two years now. - Then what happened wh en you came to kill me? - I call it a reset point? When the game goes I have to kill you. So everything will change to 24 hours back. - Then about Simon? - You never kill him. - Yes I did. 20 times. But before 24 hours, I have to kill you so that I can bring him back. - So you mean when I die now everything will be back to normal? - Yes. - No, now tell me how my getting out of here? - Under the bed, there's a button to open the door. You must die.
