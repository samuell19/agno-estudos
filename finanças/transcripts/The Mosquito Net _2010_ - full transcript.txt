Alicia! Alicia! - This one's new. - Not so loud, he's asleep. This is a new dog. - Impossible. - It's a new one. - Stop shouting. - He's new. I'm sure. - Why are you so sure? - He didn't recognise me. Because he's scared. - What are you doing? - No way. - What are you doing? - No way. Let go ofhim. We can't have any more dogs. It belongs to Lu?s. Wake him up. Seven is too many. We'll get thrown out. - Six. - Plus this one, seven. No. There were f?ve before. So you admit that he's new? - I'm not sure. - Another dog! Miguel, they all look the same. He's trying to confuse us. It's a Scottish collie. That's why he didn't understand you. I don't want to talk to him, I want him out. There's one, here. Help me count them. One. - Two... - I counted that one. - You did? - Yes. - How many so far? - One, plus your one, two. Are you sure it's the same one? Three! He was hiding in the bath. - Four. - Have you found another? - Only one. - Sure? Five dogs. The same as always. No. A year ago, we didn't have any. He won't notice, he's got loads. We can't. He's fond of them. - He only just got it! - He won't bring any more. This is the last. There have to be limits. This can't go on. Seven. - What? - The limit will be seven. Not that limit. Seven dogs. Not one more. Six. We counted six, didn't we? Six. When I was a kid, I played with silk worms. The more love Lu?s gets, the more he'll give. And if you loved him a bit less, would that work? THE MOSQUITO NET No, no... Hey, be good. Don't make so much noise. Leave him alone. I'm just saying he's making a noise. He's eating. We all are, but we can only hear him. Because you can't hear yourself. Lu?s, did you hearthat? Stop chewing and listen to your mother. I just wanted you to hear your father eating. Alicia? Alicia? Can I sleep in here tonight? If you let me sleep, yes. Alicia? - Let me sleep. - What's happening to us? To who? To you and me, and Lu?s. Take your pill and go to sleep. No. Don't get up. I always open the windows in here to airthe apartment. Madam asked me to close them. - Do you like working here? - Yes. - Do the animals bother you? - No. I like them. No, don't go. - I have to work. - No. Sit down. I've finished. Stay a while longer. Sit down, Ana. - Do you want another? - No. Thanks. - Have you been here long? - Two weeks. No, I meant in this country. One year... and twenty two days. I want you to be happy working here, with us. - I have to get on. - No, sit down for a moment. - I've a lot to do. - There's no hurry. We're just talking. "Platicando", as you say. Sit back down. Ana, I'm paying you. Sit back down! Sorry, I didn't mean it that way. I meant it's okay if you don't finish the work. There's no hurry. We can sit and talk for f?ve minutes, orten. It's no problem. You're allowed a break, that's all I meant. You can go now, if you want. That's Tracy. Troisi. Troisi, yes. - He's long-haired. - Yes. Troisi. And Trenka. Sorry, I didn't mean it like that. I meant it's okay if you don't f?nish. Carry on, if you like. This little girl doesn't walk, she's afraid of crushing ants. When she goes on camp, she doesn't use a mosquito net because she doesn't want to kill any mosquitoes. If she could, she'd wear a mask to avoid killing microbes by breathing. We get a lot of stories like this. But what we want right now is reality. Your stories don't have any kids with real problems. They're very personal, a bit too esoteric. Nobody would buy a book like this fortheir kids. Personally, I liked it. I think it's really interesting. I like the... It has a kind of... I like the perversity of your mind. You have some really wild ideas. Can I invite you to lunch? We have some non-illustrated stories. Perhaps you could illustrate someone else's story. Think about it. I can do a lot for you. Don't reject me like this. Look at this. - What? - Look, Alicia. Come here. It's dead! What's it doing here? - Did you squash it? - Yes. No. I tripped over it. - You killed it. - No, I didn't kill it. Why is there a pigeon in here? Who brought it? The window. It came in the window. What window? They're always closed. It must be Lu?s. Now he's into birds. It's still breathing. It's stone dead. It has a mark on its neck. It must have been a cat. This is a footprint. This can't go on. Just talk to him. Me. It was me. - You brought it? - Yes, it was sick. You brought home a sick pigeon? Yes, I wanted to save it. Alicia, are you serious? No, I don't believe you. You don't even like pigeons! You felt sorry for it and brought it home? Yes, I told you already. You, get away! Stop it! - What are you doing? - He was going to eat it. He was only sniff?ng it. Take it. Take it! I didn't touch him. You hit him. I saw you. He was going to eat the pigeon. You're a brute. It's sad, this music. The other day, you brought home a pigeon... It got better. This morning your dad and I opened the window and it flew away. It died. In its sleep. It didn't suffer. It didn't feel a thing. What do you want us to do with... What shall we do with... With the body? You can throw it in the garbage. For you. State-of-the-art. Look. "Protection for hands". - I use gloves. - I bought gloves too. Thank you. The smallest size. Try them. Sit down. Try them on. Do you like the colour? Here. Let me see your hand. They're beautiful. You have to look afterthem. Do you know what that means? Do you understand? She understands everything. Don't you want me to tell you? - Are you going to play dolls? - She likes playing alone. Do you want to tell me something? - Miguel hit a dog the other day. - He beat a dog? - Just a slap on the snout. - The bastard! It wasn't hard, he didn't hurt it. - It was to teach it a lesson. - There are other ways. Yes, there are many ways. - Do you think he hits the boy? - Lu?s? No. You know he doesn't. - Miguel could never hit anyone. - Then why are you upset? It's the way he did it. He did it in a way I don't like. It was humiliating. I've never seen him like that. He was different. He was enjoying his authority. Do you suspect anything? - Suspect what? - Has Lu?s told you something? About what? I don't know, something. Maybe when you're not there, he takes it out on the kid. No. You're not always with him. I'm telling you, no. Tell me the truth. He doesn't hit him. - He's never hit him. - I'm not talking about that. Alicia, don't you follow the news? Yes, I do, but not him. What are you implying, Raquel? Why are you saying this? I only said that he hit a dog. What did you do to her? Hold her. I cut her hair. - What are you doing? - I'm cutting hers. I'm going to cut hers too. No. They're my scissors. They're mine, I won't let you. What did you do? Are you crazy? - I cut her hair. - And you dare to answer? - You asked her. - Don't defend her. She's just a kid. No, don't cut off any more! No, stop it. She should respect herthings and other's. That's enough, Raquel. Don't move, or I'll cut it all off, just like theirs. - I'll shave your head. - That's enough! - I forgive you. - What did you say? She said she forgives you. It hurts me more than it hurts her. I don't like punishing her. She was only playing. I don't like punishing her. I gave her a pill, but she's... It has no effect. - You give her pills? - Only when she's hyper. - She does it on purpose. - No, Raquel. I've told her lots of times not to do it. But I don't hit her. I've never hit her. Never. And I never will. - Of course you won't. - Never. Not even a slap on the snout. Here. This is for you. Take it. All of it. No. It's for you. Why? I've never done this before. Just your hand. I've never paid anyone... Mao. Mao. Mao... He's still breathing. It's a strong sedative. He's dead. Did Lu?s ask you? It's not forever. It's just a break. It was an accident. I should've put him out before I opened it. But I didn't. I don't know. I didn't know cats jumped out of windows. Why, Alicia? We've been over it a hundred times. It's not working. We haven't been happy for ages. I don't feel right. I don't want to do anything with you. I'd like some time alone. I need it. We've created a monster. He'll throw us both out. Today, it's me, tomorrow, it'll be you. - He'll never stop. - You want to destroy us? We're not happy because you're obsessed with him. - Obsessed? - Obsessed. - Obsessed. - Totally. Your son has problems. You always blame him. You've always been jealous of Lu?s. I'm leaving, I can't take this. - No, you're not leaving now. - Yes, I am. - You're not leaving. - Yes, I am. Why do you always leave when we talk? - Not talking, arguing. - So what? Everyone does it. Everyone argues. I'm leaving. I can't breathe here. I'm suffocating. Let's sleep. We'll see things clearertomorrow. No. I don't want you here when he wakes up. - Raquel made you a room up. - You want me to leave? They're expecting you for dinner. You know I'd never go there. She doesn't mind. It's a big flat, she won't bother you. Miguel! Where are you going? It's so hot you can't even think. There are thousands of huge birds, the sky is much bigger. There are thousands of stars. But I'm tired. All I want is to die. Forever. ...forever. And how are you? Stop pretending that you care. Why did you come? I wanted to see you. Where's Alicia? She has a book to hand in. She sends her love. What have you got there? A gift. You brought me a gift? Open it. Stick it up your arse! Put it on. Don't you want to hear it? - You don't want to try it? - No. Go on, it's delicious. Just a little bit. No, thanks, Mum. Call me Alicia. I've always called you Mum. Try it. We're alone, we can be friends. You're my mother, not my friend. Don't speak to me like that. I don't like it. I call you Lu?s, not "son". - "Son" is awful. - So is "Mum". And you're not a kid anymore. More. Was it good? - I want another one. - No, it'll make you sick. I want another. - Are you sure? - Yes. What kind? Pistachio? - Kiwi? Mango? - Chocolate. Again? No. Try something else. I want chocolate. One more chocolate, please. Large or small? - Large. - Large. What kind of sedative? The strongest you've got. Morphine? Ketamine? It's not for me. For your father? It's forthe animals. I don't want them to suffer. They don't need it now, but they will. I want to help them. - What was the cat called? - Mao. - Meow? - No, Mao. Mao Zedong. I don't like Japanese food. It's forthe animals. I don't want them to suffer. He was dying and I didn't stroke him. Do you know where Lu?s is? No. He wasn't in class. Do you want a lift home? I love seeing you happy. Another. You won't eat it. Yes. You think you can? Yes. Susanna, I mean all of it. You'll have to eat it all. Are you coming tomorrow? Where? - Didn't he mention it? - No. Tomorrow is his birthday. I'd like you to spend the day with us. He'd really appreciate it. Will you come? Yes. Pass me my bag. Thanks. No. It's for Lu?s. It's for you to give to him. It's all right. Open it. Go on. Try it on. Perfect. It suits you. - Keep it. - No, no. Yes. It's okay, I'll buy him another. Then you'll both have one. - You said you liked it. - Yes. It's my pleasure to give you a present. Thank you. It says "Lu?s". Yes, of course. I'll buy you another one. Keep it. You've got to eat it. You made a deal, you have to stick to it. Or I'll force you to eat it, so you learn what the word "responsible" means. Susanna, do it for me. I don't want to force you. That will hurt us both. Sorry. Sorry. Happy Birthday, Lu?s. How many dogs have you got? Norma Jean, Norma Jean... The TVstar! Norma Jean, "The tin foil dog" Bravo! What are you doing, Lu?s? Don't you like it? "The Wizard of Oz". Like from "The Wizard of Oz". It's an old f?lm that he likes. He told me he really liked it. Why did he say he liked it if he doesn't like it. I'm sure he likes it. He always liked to dress up in bright colours. Really bright colours. I once bought him an astronaut costume. He wanted to live in space. He said the air here on Earth was too heavy. I thought he'd like to see Norma Jean like that. He's really drunk. - I liked it though. - Really? Have you seen "The Wizard of Oz"? Yes. I really like that film. I'm really pleased that you've found a job. Yes, it's a good job. How's the boy? - Is he well? - Yes, he's f?ne. And the dogs and the cats. Everyone is f?ne. You forgot them. I've really missed your hands. Not only your hands, all of you. I don't know why, but when I think of you, I see your hands. I don't know why I did it. I didn't want to hurt you. You didn't. Nobody hurts me. Forgive me, I'm sorry. In any case, I'd like to pay you somehow... No. Forthe problems I caused you. Please, take it. Here. Please. Won't you let me buy you dinner? I came because I left without saying goodbye to Madam and the boy. She always treated me well. Well, I was going to pay. That's the price of a good meal. Don't you want to have dinner with me? The food is really good here. Take me to a hotel. You want to eat in a hotel. Let's go to a hotel. We can't go to my place. Ana, it hurts me when you talk like that. I don't want to buy you. I only want to help. Everyone is looking at us. Take it, please. - Do you live with someone? - My son. You've got a son? I didn't know that. - And the father? - He's not around. And I don't have a job. I got fired. The lady said I was stealing money. But it's not true. She's a crazy old bat. She reported me, I lost my work permit. A little help. I don't want you to help me. You can pay me back. I'll never be able to. Take it. What do I have to do? Take it, please. You're very handsome. And you have lovely hair. Will you let me touch it? Even blind, I'd know you were blonde. I'm going now. I'm going to sleep. I need it. Good night. You, in Lu?s's bed. It's the room with the piano. You know which one? I changed the sheets yesterday. No, the day before yesterday. Yesterday. Oh, whatever. - Good night. - Good night, Alicia. What are you doing? No, no... No. Sit down. No, Ana, it's not like that. That's not what I want. I didn't ask anything of you. What's that? We don't have to if you don't want to. Mum... What are you doing? Changed your room. Are you here? What are you doing? You have to rest. Good night, Lu?s. What are you doing here? What are you doing here, Sergi? You can't stay in here. You should go. Sergi. Quietly. Go back to your room. Go. Go on. What now? We wait. Did you turn on the gas rings? Yes. And the oven? Yes. And the door, did you open it? You told me to close it. The oven door. You forget things. How about putting our heads in the oven? What? Yes. We'd breathe in the gas directly. I could hold your head inside until you stop breathing. Then how would you kill yourself without me? Did something happen yesterday? Something you didn't like? If there's something you don't want to see... Take off the glasses. Look at me, Lu?s. Lu?s, please, say something. Sergi, we were very drunk. I never drink. And you... You're stilljust a kid. I'm glad you two are still friends. I'd like it to stay that way. What I'm saying is... I'm his mother. And I want you to be his friend. I'm not going to tell you I didn't enjoy it. It's been twenty, thirty years since I did it with someone like you. I'm your whore, I'm your whore. I'll do anything you tell me. You're so beautiful. I'm your whore, I'm your whore. She left the window open. Kimura. Kimura. Kimura! Kimura! Walk. Squash them. Don't you want to now? Walk! Is that funny? Does it make you laugh? Don't you want to go to the hotel? Yes. No, I don't know. Of course I do. It's not that, it's just... I don't want it to be... We can just go to the hotel and not do anything. We can sleep together. There are two beds, we can sleep separately. Keep each other company. We could sleep in separate beds and hold hands. Honestly, I just want to be with you. That's all I want. We could go to the car. - You want to go for a drive? - Yes. Okay, good idea. After dinner, I'll take you to see the city from the hills. Have you ever seen all the stars? The sky full of stars? There are lots of stars tonight. Really? I hadn't noticed. Sometimes I don't look up. The sky at night is like a city. And if you look at the sky you can imagine it is the city. Like the world upside down. As if you lived in the sky. What are you doing? - Shouldn't I take off my shoes? - No, you're f?ne like that. However you're most comfortable. It's a shame, there aren't so many tonight. What are you doing? Get dressed. Put your blouse on. I don't want it like that. I want some popcorn. You want to watch this too? Buy me some popcorn. This is a luxury hotel. Get off me, whore. Don't say that, Sergi. I don't like that. Don't you want to be my whore now? Take it easy. Easy! Kiss me. Wait! When the rainy season came, we had to close all the doors and windows. The village always flooded. One time, there was a mudslide. A river of mud washed away all the houses. It was at night, very late, everyone was asleep. Elia was killed. Elia was a cousin of mine who I loved a lot. She nearly always stayed at our house. But that night she slept at home, her mum was sick and she had to nurse her. Turn off the TV. I want to talk to you. No, not now, Sergi. We have to go. - Let's do it again. - No, they're waiting for me. You love it. I know you love it. No, let me go. Suck my dick. - This isn't funny. - You'll do what I tell you. You don't understand any of this. Not my hair! You're hurting me! Let me go! That hurts. You're doing it wrong. Cover yourteeth with your lips. Like this? Yes. I'm having a rest. I was really tired. Where's your ring? I lost it. I'll buy you another one. I'd prefer cash. They said it wasn't worth much. It was gold-plated. They're jealous. It was white gold, 18 carat gold. I had it engraved with your name. They stole it. I couldn't do anything. I want him to come back home. Me too. - Do you like it? - Yes. - Really? - Yes, it's very good. - You don't think it's a bit sharp? - No, I like it. And the wine? Do you like it? - Yes. - Really? It's a very good wine. Thank you. And thanks forthe microwave. It's great. You're very tidy. Yes, I like to keep things tidy. Me too. Yes, I know. And the windows open. I don't open mine because the courtyard is smelly. I was raped. I was raped... Who was it? Do you know him? Alicia, do you know him? Let's go and report it. - Yes. - No. Are you afraid? I can't report it. It'll be tough, but we have to do it. Why not? Of course you must. No. Did he threaten you? Did he hit you? Was he armed? Alicia, who is it? We spent the night together. - You've got a lover? - No, he's not my lover. But you were sleeping together. You'd done it with him before? It wasn't a stranger. Were you in love with him? - No, I wasn't in love. - But you wanted him? Not then. Not by that point. We'd decided to stop seeing each other. - Just at that moment. - We'd just done it. You'd just done it. You don't have to turn it into... Don't allow yourself to think that it was rape. It's not rape. It's not rape. I'm trying to be positive. Don't let it traumatise you. I know it's tough, and that you loved him, but perhaps it's betterthis way. Positive thinking. If he didn't treat you well, you shouldn't see him again. I want Miguel to come home, for everything to be like before. What's the matter? She's sad. She was treated badly. - Did you burn yourself? - She did it. Don't say that, Susanna. Yes. She burnt me with a cigarette. Go and play. We're talking. Don't be sad. Raquel? - Are you smoking again? - Yes, I started again. - No, Raquel... - Yes. But you were overthe worst. It had been two months. How could you? I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Well, it's okay. You can try again. I'll help you. You can do it. Miguel had relapses too. I did that to her. On her hand. I burned her. What are you saying, Raquel? Raquel... - It was an accident. - No, it wasn't an accident. I told her that if she did it again... I warned her very clearly. - And she did it again. - You did that to her? Yes. - Don't joke about this. - No, it's no joke. I told her not to move, that she could get burned. - So she moved... - Yes, but I had the cigarette there. I held it near her and I burned her hand. Ifl hadn't wanted to, I'd have moved. Raquel... I tortured her... No, Raquel, stop it. I don't like you talking like this. You were telling her off with a cigarette in your hand. You didn't want to hit her. You could have done. A lot of mothers hit their children. You don't. She was seeking attention, and she got too close. You threatened her. A lot of people... We all threaten our kids. I don't know how to do it. Some days I just can't deal with her. She's like a stranger, she scares me. She's always scared me. My daughter scares me. It's so strange, Alicia. Why do we hurt those we love the most? Hold on. - What big hands. - Yes. Alicia, can you hear me? Alicia, can you hear me? There. Alicia? Are you okay? Is there something wrong? No, I'm f?ne. Yes. What? No, I'm at the supermarket, alone. Alicia? Are you crying? Yes. You want me to come right now? Me too. They'll never publish these. There's too much blood. They look like they're floating. The people in the space station said that doing five minutes of exercise in space, they burned more calories than in an hour on Earth. They're floating. As if the air is weightless. Stop! Ana! Ana! It's a wild pig. A boar. A baby. Yes, he ran into the car. Let's go. Next it'll be the hyenas and the vultures. No, we can't leave it here. We'll call someone to pick it up tomorrow. - It's dying. - Don't get too close. An injured boar can be dangerous. We have to do something. There's nothing to be done, let's go. Kill it! I don't have a gun. We could call the hunters association. Ana... Help me! No, not with that stone. Help me pick it up. Not with that. Let's get out of here. I don't drive. It's still alive. You ran over its legs. Stand back. Your dad and I used to watch the sunset every night. We would watch it from here, just like we are now. You weren't born then. But I dreamed about having you. I wanted to call you Lu?s. You wanted to build us a house with sea views. I'd like it to be here, where we took this photo. We were very happy. We spent all our days together. You could have an animal sanctuary in the garden. I'd look afterthe decoration. And your father... Your father... You did the right thing, Miguel. It was badly injured. It's much better off now. Do you want to wash the car now? Then we can come back. Is there something wrong? Have you got something to tell me? Yes. You're going back to Alicia, and don't want to see me again. And now you'll give me cash to help out my son and I. Sorry. Lu?s? Your dad. We can adopt another dog, if you like. You said there was one missing. No, we're f?ne as we are. Well, only one. - He doesn't need any more. - But ifhe wants... Lu?s isn't here. Where is he? - Lu?s! - He's coming. We're all sitting down. Did you give him a pill? Just how you like them. - No, he's a vegetarian. - It's forthe dog. I've got something to tell you all. Hold on, Susanna. I want to tell you that... yesterday, I had a phone call. It was to tell me that... they're going to publish my second book. That's great, Alicia. Congratulations. - Like Madonna. - No, Madonna is a writer. I mean she doesn't do the illustrations. - But she's a great dancer. - Yes, the best. I've also got something I want to say. Maria and I have been married for forty-five years... No, forty-six years. - What's all this? - We've had good times. And also bad times. But now something terrible has happened. - She doesn't love me anymore. - Dad, not now. She's asked for a divorce. - No way. - She probably just said it. I'm sure she wasn't serious. I love her. You know that. I disgust her. She says she can't bear me anymore. - How long have they? - He won't go into a home. I want to die. - Kill me. - Don't say that, Robert. You, my grandson, get me an overdose. Leave him out of this. You'll have separate rooms. You won't even have to see each other. I'm completely devoted to her. I've cared for her. I've been caring for her for six years. And you haven't done anything for me. And now, you want to lock me up with her. You can't do that to us. I have my dignity. I've never loved anyone. Not even my own son. I don't understand love. I don't know how people love. I don't like people who love. Not here! What are you doing? She's okay. I put my mattress on the ground. But she doesn't even want to see me. What have you done here? She did it to me. She's gone for a smoke. You can stay here for a few days. No, we can't. We've got the girl this weekend. Just a few days, while I f?nd another home. Where will he sleep? I can't leave him with her. - And her? - In the care home. Raquel! Raquel! - Are you expecting someone? - No. . Sit down, Lu?s. - Sit! Sit down. Who is it? Don't open it. Alicia, shall I go? - No, don't! - Sit down, Raquel. Nobody move.
