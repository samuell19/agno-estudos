Hmm? Holy shit. Great. Hey, Alexa, I finished updating your computer. - Should be all set. - Thanks, Trey. - Good morning. - Where is he? - Where's who? - That man-child you helped get a sales job here a few months ago. - Ah, him. Haven't seen him. - Well, if you do see him... Don't worry. I'll let him know. Thank you! - Beep beep! - Uh-huh. Hey, you wanted to see me? Great. You're both here. Both? How's it going, Parker? Well, it was going great, till I tried to pull into my assigned parking spot, only to discover you couldn't tell the difference between yours and mine... again. So you had to walk a couple spaces. It's not that big of a deal. It's a big deal because I earned that spot. And yet the short time that I've been here, I've somehow managed to close more deals than you. Check your figures, Crawford. I closed on San tone Ford last week. Eight car dealerships up and down the West Coast. Congratulations, Parker. King's Coffee Roasters, 22 shops. Bennington Books. Contract goes out next week. I've been at this company 9 1/2 years. You've been here, what, a minute? Imagine what I could do with 90 seconds. The two of you bicker just like my parents, but I love it. You know why? Because your competitive nature brings out the best in both of you. Plus I know that you'll go out and close another deal, just to get the other one back. Oh, before I forget... - Happy Birthday. - Oh, thank you. - It's your birthday? - Yeah. Congratulations on turning another year older. You did it! And it shows. How about a birthday hug? Huh? No? So, you wanted to see me. - Yes, I did. - Oh, you wanted to see her too? Yeah, both of you. Have a seat, please. Uh, wait, shouldn't Jacqueline be here? Well, Jacqueline, it turns out, accepted a position over at Bernstein and Barlow, effective immediately. So, that means I need a new director of sales. And I'm looking at my two best prospects. How do I get the job? What she means is how do I get the job? There's a potential client, which could be worth a lot of money for this firm. I'm sure you're both familiar with Goodwin Wines. - Mm. - No. Oh, you wouldn't. They make grown-up drinks. Well, turns out Craig Goodwin, the owner of the company, is in the market for a new ad firm, so I've decided whichever one of you gets him to sign gets the promotion. Wait. Whichever one of you? Ah. Speak of the devil and he shall appear at your door. Craig Goodwin, please meet Alexa and Jason. These are the two fabulous sales reps that I was telling you about. Mm-hmm. Well, two of the things I love in this world are... keeping folks on their toes, especially those I'm considering going into business with, and the other is good old-fashioned competition. To the victor go the spoils. Who's Victor? I thought it was between me and Parker. Isn't it? Ah? Ah, I'm kidding, right? You didn't say your guy was funny too. I can be funny. Well, young lady, I am looking forward to hearing your ideas about how to boost my company. - Debra? - Hmm? The presentation. Can I expect it on or by the 10th? - They'll be ready. - Say, um... you wouldn't happen to play golf, would you? Only... every weekend. I've got a hookup over at the Larson Country Club, if you're interested. Larson? Man, I've been dying to play that course. Anytime you want to hit the links, you just let me know. Good start, Jason. Okay, Craig and I have much to discuss, and if I were the two of you, I would do everything you could to win over our new friend. Mm-hmm. Okay. Parker, wait up. Say, you wouldn't happen to play golf, would you? You got to learn to read the room. He had a tag on his computer bag. - You know what? - Let me guess. You've given it some thought, and you want to concede. No judgment. Really. Come on, we'll tell them together. Keep talking, Crawford. Pretty soon, it'll be about the time you almost got that director's job. Don't you want to save yourself the embarrassment... Of defeating you? Why would I want to do that? I better not find your car in my space tomorrow. Guess who's gonna be the Driscoll Group's new director of sales? Debra offered you the promotion? Well, no, not exactly, but there's only two of us in the running. Who's the other one? Alexa Parker? Yeah, but I wouldn't worry about it. She's been here, what, six years? Nine. Exactly. It's time for some new blood. Besides, that new assisted-living place to move my mom into? I can really use the raise. Like you said, with the new house and all... You're not the least bit intimidated? I have worked here since I was in school. I've earned this. He has brought in some pretty big clients. Wait, you think she has a chance? I don't know. I mean, if you weren't so busy fighting with her all the time, think she might surprise you. Ah, please. She's nothing special. Come on, you can't tell me he's not a little charming. He is a salesman, Hannah. That's what they do. So, there's not a little incy-wincy part of you that finds him attractive? I guess one would admit that she is technically an attractive woman. Mm. You wonder if she's still got that same boyfriend. Pleased to let you know I know nothing about her personal life. Besides, I'm very happily involved. Does Perry have anything special planned for your birthday? He's taking me to lunch at The Belvedere. Ooh, fancy! You should have seen him when he asked me. Hannah, he was so nervous. Wait, you don't think he's going to... I don't wanna jinx it, but... How are things with, uh, what's-her-name anyway? Julia? Yeah. I get 'em all mixed up. It's been six months. Ooh! That's practically an eternity in Jason time. Dang! This could be the one. - She knows I'm not that guy. - Ah. And what guy is that? Oh, the overly needy boyfriend, one that's always talking about the future, making promises, planning out the next 15 years, you know. And you're sure you're not talking about what you don't want? She gets me. You know, we communicate without words. Uh-huh. Just a couple of mimes in love, huh? Yeah. Oh, I gotta go. I'm gonna be late. Okay, good luck. I know, I know. I won't jinx it. Bye. I know, I get it. Yes. Hundred percent. I know. Yeah, you're right. No, you're right. You're right. I gotta go. Sorry I'm late, baby. Uh, such a crazy morning. I can't wait to tell you all about it. Who were you talking to? My, uh, my life coach. So, you decided to do it. It was such great advice. I can't thank you enough. You remember last year when I was stressing over that one account? It did wonders for me. Is something wrong? Nothing. Nothing. Actually, there is something I need to talk about. - Um... - Oh? Alex, I've been doing a lot of thinking about things, about us, about these last 10 months. Uh-huh. And I think, well, that it's... It's time for us to, uh... Yes? To break up. - Wait, what? - I know. I hate that I'm doing this, but my life coach thinks that... Wait, the life coach I recommended? She thinks that in order to achieve my potential, I need to be unattached. You are attached. To me. I know. But we have plans for the future. No. You have plans. Honestly, I don't even know what I want anymore. Is this a joke? Am I being recorded? I know the timing isn't great. I'm being dumped... on my birthday. Oh, yeah, right, I forgot. Happy Birthday. This isn't happening. I... Actually, I gotta go. I have, like, a Zoom session with her in-in 30 minutes. She'd wanna know how this went. But, uh, I really am sorry. You're a great woman, Alex. - What? - Bye. Okay. Oh, my God. Are you okay? Great! I hate technology. This is an awful place you work. Just awful! I'm such a fool. I'm sure I.T. can get you another one. I'm not talking about the phone. I mean, I actually thought he was gonna propose. It's such a cliché, right? My whole life's a cliché. Not your whole life. One of these things is getting the client to understand. Oh, there she is. - Hi, Brad. - Hey, Hannah. So, what are you two scheming about over here? Well, if you must know, we were just, uh, strategizing about how I'm gonna get that account. - Oh, yeah? - Mm-hmm. Come on, Brad. Let me show you what I'm working on. - Brad. - Hmm? - Let me show you. - Oh, yeah. Uh, what was that? What was... That was... That was nothing. What were we talking about again? - My broken heart. - Right. Well, there's no one better at talking the heartbroken off the ledge of despair than Alexa Parker. You're like... the breakup whisperer. Well, who's gonna whisper at my breakup? Well, you can always call me. Uh, eventually. Is it working? It's as dead as my love. Well, at least you backed it up to the cloud, right? Ugh! I hate technology! Oh, here you go. - A brand-new work phone. - Thank you. Yeah, okay, I've got some cases you might be interested in. That's okay. I don't really plan on dropping it into another bucket of water. Here's the one I use. Plastic screen protector, rubber casing. It'll keep her safe if it falls out of your pocket - or slips off your desk. - Yeah, but I'm good. I just... I... They call this one the lifeboat. It'll withstand about a foot of water, so in case you feel like playing Angry Birds in the bathtub or something. Yeah, not really. Okay. This one right here, this is the tank. That's aircraft-grade aluminum right there. You can get a running start and punt kick this off the Transamerica building, and it won't even crack the screen. Here. Oh! You feel that? Strong, huh? - Yeah, it's heavy. - You can keep it. No, no, you... I think I'm good with this. Thank you, though. I appreciate it. Hey, do me a favor and backup your phone this time. Yep! Hey, Julia, I'm home. You know, I was thinking, why don't we get some takeout tonight? What was the name of that Italian place you wanted to go to? Um... "Dear Jason, I can't do this anymore. I need to be with someone whose idea of romance doesn't end with a jokey Valentine's Day card." I gave that to you with love. I know you think you're here with me, but you're really not. Goodbye. Julia. Life coach. - Hey! - Hey, there he is. What, uh... What number are you calling me from? Oh, sorry. Work cell. Ah. So, uh, what up? What are you doing right now? I have to work on this presentation thing. Why? Wanna come over? Play some Madden? Order pizza? On a school night! Bad boy! What's, uh... What's really going on? Julia left me. Wait, what? I thought you guys were a couple of mimes in love. Yeah. Guess it's true. Everyone hates mimes. Well, I mean, if it means anything, I'm sorry. If you're really sorry, you'd come over and watch me beat you in Madden. I thought you weren't the overly needy boyfriend. - I'm not. - All right. Then it's all good. Don't sweat it. You got this. Yeah. You're right. See you tomorrow? Yeah. All right. Bye, dude. Bye. Who actually remembers phone numbers these days? 555-01... 2-8? 8-2? 0-1-8-2. Hey, it's me. I'm sorry in advance for the extended text, but I just don't feel like talking right now. And, to be honest, I don't feel like doing much of anything right now besides drinking Merlot and crying my heart out. But hey, I heard red wine's good for the heart, so maybe the night will end up a wash. Wrong number. My heart feels like it's been torn out of my chest, thrown on the floor and stomped on, like someone was turning a bucket of grapes into my next glass of vino. Wrong number, whoever you are. Next glass of vino. Could use that for the Goodwin pitch. Let's play, let's play, let's play! And you are preaching to the choir. Are you there? I am, but I don't think I'm the you you're looking for. I think you texted the wrong number. Uh, sorry. New phone. No worries. I can't remember anybody's number by heart either. You probably think I'm some depressed lunatic. It happens. To be honest, it's happening to me right now too. Did you get dumped too? About an hour ago. Must be something in the air. I'm so sorry. Really? When did yours go down? Over lunch. At least tell me it was delicious. I didn't even get to order, but I did manage to drop my phone in a bucket of melted ice, so there's that. Which is how we got here. Which is how we got here. It reminds me of a quote: "The more I know of the world, the more I am convinced I shall never see a man whom I can really love." Whoa. You've read Sense and Sensibility? It's a classic. Perry, my ex, thought it was corny. Julie would say the same thing. She would say, "Why are you wasting your time with that?" What do they know, right? You know, it's a great movie. Would you believe I've never seen it? You're kidding. I don't know. I never like when they make books into movies. You should see what they did with Anne Steele. Hey, no spoilers. I'm sorry. But seriously, you gotta watch it. I'll put it on the list. Happy? Very. I should probably go wallow in my misery for a while. Yeah, I should do the same thing. Thanks for the chat, though. I think it helped. Me too. Good night. Good night. Hmm. Hey, Cheryl. Hey, Parker. Crawford. You can try and distract me all you want. It's not gonna work. The fact that you're even saying the word "distract" implies that it's working. Let's make a deal. I'll stay out of your face this week, and you stay out of mine. Eh. Deal. Deal. I'm getting that promotion. Finally, we have something in common. Growing up here in this beautiful vineyard, I'm reminded that Goodwin Wines is more than just a family business. It's a way of life. It is our great privilege to continue to bring the best chardonnay and cabernet grapes to the world. Knock knock. Hey. Uh, what's your phone number? I know Perry just dumped you, but you should know I am nobody's rebound. Very funny. What is it? 555-0128. 2-8. I had 8-2. I'm lost. Okay, you know I had to get a new phone yesterday, right? I still think you should have gone for the waterproof case. Well, I was still feeling pretty bad when I got home and... You should text me, silly. Well, I did, or at least I thought I did. Wait. You didn't know my number? I'm your best friend! How do you not know my number? Oh, come on. Who knows anyone's number anymore? - I know yours. - Yeah, well... Wait, are you telling me that you sent a broken heart text to the wrong person? Oh, no. Yeah, and I really poured my heart out on that thing too. So, what happened? What do you mean, what happened? Were they mean? Did they make fun of you? What? Quite the opposite, actually. The same thing just happened to him. It was a him. So, like, how long did you guys message each other? I mean, not that long, you know. But it's nice knowing not every guy out there is a complete asshole. And you're telling me you have no idea who this woman is. None. No names, no pictures? It was freeing that way. I wasn't concerned about being judged. Wait a minute. You opened up to this stranger... about your feelings? Brad, don't get crazy, all right? Maybe it's Julia. It's not Julia. You're sure she's not playing some mind games, checking in on how her boy is doing? I think I would know if I was being catfished. Ah, right, because you're Mr. Sensitive now. And speaking of which, what is this? What? It's a good book. This is chick lit, man. Don't tell me you've actually been reading this, have you? Heck no. It's Julia's. I found it after she left. - Mm-hmm. - Yeah. Okay. Hmm... Maybe it's her. Get after it. Play a, play a. It's my mom. Is it really that funny, huh? What, your virtual rebound girl? Mm-mm. Hey, she is a real person, all right? Hey, and you're a real mime, all right? Remember that. I had grilled cheese for lunch, Mom. Who wants to have a ladies' happy hour and watch The Bachelor? Come on. At least I can call this research for my pitch, right? That's the spirit, no pun intended. Oh. Do you think it's bad to drink after a breakup? That's what you told me the last time I got dumped. Why is it so much easier to dole out advice than it is to take it? Ooh, ah. Every time I burn my hand. Virtual rebound girl. Well? Nothing. You could always text him... again. I think I need more wine. Cheers to that. It's a onetime thing. She realized she's made a mistake. She's moved on. I mean, that could be anyone. There's only one way to find out. - It's him. - I knew it. I'm not interrupting anything, am I? I'm not here. Hi. Nope. Just sitting here alone, doing research. Me too. Oh, tell him what happened. You're gonna laugh, but I figured out what happened last night. So, I got the last two digits of my best friend's phone number backwards. Funny, huh? Who remembers anybody's number anymore? You... That's it. You both are made for each other. Oh, ask for a picture. Oh, no, I'm not gonna do that. He could be homely. He could be hot. Look, I don't want to ruin what we have. And I'm serious. It's not like that. Well, text me later and tell me how it goes. All right, I will. You could get a name and make sure there's not a podcast about this guy. Very funny. Love you, girl. Love ya. So, should we exchange names? I like it better this way. No names, no work talk, no reason to lie. But we need to call each other something. Jack and Jill, Bonnie and Clyde, Sonny and Cher? How about... Him and Her? Perfect. So, what are you doing? Watching reality television, drinking wine, and wondering where my life went wrong. How about you? Just finishing off dinner. Oh, you cook? Yep. Made it myself. So, what are we watching? Oh, no, no, no. I am not watching The Bachelor with you. You won't watch Sense and Sensibility, but you'll watch The Bachelor? To be honest, I'd rather just talk to you. Me too. Really? Yeah. I thought it was cool how you put your feelings out there like that... even if you did think I was your friend. I needed to vent to someone. I'm not mad it was you. Besides, I'd say we're friends now, wouldn't you? I guess so. I take it you're not the touchy-feely type. I think my ex would probably say no. Can I be honest with you about something? Of course. I've never actually told a woman that I love her. Really? Well, did your parents say it to each other a lot growing up? As much as any other parents, I suppose. Are you close? To my mom. My dad passed away a couple years ago. I'm sorry to hear that. Both my parents are gone. I'm sorry. I was always close with my mom. Sometimes I have these dreams about my dad, and when I wake up... it's like I've lost him all over again. You do realize you just opened up to a woman, right? Oh, bite your tongue. But I know exactly what you mean. I have those dreams too. I've always imagined my dad walking me down the aisle, or that my mother would be there playing with her grandkids. Why do people have to get old? Right? You know, I don't think I've talked to anyone about this before. Me neither, not for a long time anyway. Guess I should thank you... for getting me out of my comfort zone. I needed it. No worries. I needed it too. I better get going. I have an early meeting in the morning. Me too. Good night, Her. Good night, Him. So... this is our top cab from 2007, and one of my absolute favorites. Did I read that cabernet sauvignon is the most planted wine grape in the whole world? And with very good reason. You're quite right. Thank you. Well... - Salut. - It's good. Mmm. Mm-hmm. Alexa, your considered opinion, please. It's fruity. I'm detecting notes of black currant and black cherry with festive notes of green pepper, spice notes of vanilla and clove from the oak barrels. Very good. And you, sir. I'm feeling some rich, complex flavors. Strawberries, sporty spice... ...and some hints of cedar and caramel. Mm-hmm. Jason, you strike me as a beer and wings kind of guy, but don't worry. I love hops just as much as the grape. Ah, a beer-drinking man. I knew it, I knew it. However, wouldn't you agree that one should have some knowledge of the product? Yeah, well, you don't need to drive a Maserati to know how to sell one, am I right? Right on. Mm-hmm. You know, I think I'm gonna take a look around the property. - See what comes to me. - Good idea. I think I'll do the same thing. - Fine. - Fine. Told you. Interesting duo. Can you chat? I could really use a friend. Got a few minutes for you. Are you at work right now? Kind of on a field trip. I kind of am too. Certainly is a beautiful day for it. I guess. Uh-oh. Sounds like someone's having a bad day. I'm sorry. I don't mean to dump all my drama on you. No, no, it's what I'm here for, right? You know what I mean. Right, right, of course. Alexa, we're leaving soon! Gotta go. Boss is calling. Talk to you later? I look forward to it. Me too. Are you there? I'm just finishing up a real important conference call. Thank you for today. I was having a moment. I know the feeling. Do you ever feel like the world is conspiring against you? Wow. Still bothered by the breakup? Among other things. I still can't believe he broke up with me on my birthday. Sounds like a real prize. I thought he was. And now for the first time my life, I feel like I'm not in control. Control of what? My emotions. I tend to go overboard in the worry department. I'm sure it doesn't help that I'm having drama at work. Oh, yeah. Must be going around. You know, if you ask me, thinking you can be in complete control of anything, it's just a pipe dream. As John Lennon would say, "Life is what happens to you while you're busy making other plans." That was Allen Saunders. No, that was definitely John Lennon. Who took it from Allen Saunders. For real? For real. So, if you were me, what would you do? Do what I always do: go along with it. Try to make the most of it. And most importantly, don't concern yourself with the wrong things. Is that how you're getting over your ex? Trying to, thanks to you. Talk to you tomorrow, Him? Talk to you tomorrow, Her. What do you think? I'm torn. Because of your ex? What if we met, and we ruin this? What if it's perfect the way it is? I really like what we have. I'm afraid if we met, we'd lose it. You're probably right. I'm really glad I met you. Me too. Good night. Good night. You busted out the John Lennon? Allen Saunders, apparently. I don't know, man, I think I'm with her on this one. Oh, come on! I think you're making a mistake. Remember that woman I met online, before Julia? The nurse? No, no, the paralegal. My point is that everything was going great, right? We were talking all the time, we were texting back and forth every night, then when we finally met in person... it all fell apart. Because she had a mustache. No. It's because we didn't click, all right? So? I mean, wouldn't you just, like, rather rip the Band-Aid off and get it over with anyway? It's a big enough distraction as it is. Maybe that's a good thing. I mean, with all my mom's bills, now I have to cover the entire rent without... you know. Julia. I need that promotion. That's what I have to focus on. Not Her. And you're right. Alexa's tougher than I thought. Not to mention, wine isn't exactly my forte. Look, you're the best salesman I know. I'd bet you could sell a hamburger to a vegan if you really wanted to do it. Well, at least I can describe a hamburger. Oh, great. Then you can buy me one. Funny. Seriously, though... I think you got something good going. And if you play your cards right, I think you could get the job and the girl. - My cards, huh? - Yeah. Yeah? Step aside. Let me show you bowling, all right? All right. I'm fine, Mom, I promise. Of course I miss Julia. It just... It wasn't right, that's all. I know, I know. I'm working on it. How many times do I have to tell you? I don't want you worrying about that stuff. Just send me the bill. Yes, I'm keeping track of every penny. You're welcome. I love you too. I'll call you later. - Hey, what's up? - Hey. Just wondering if you heard from Debra about the date of the pitch. No, I haven't. Soon, though. Hmm. Is everything okay? Yeah, yeah. Yeah, I mean, I'm just sitting here, wondering what I'm gonna do with the extra income when I bring in Craig's winery. There goes that common ground again. Yep. So, you think that's Him? Hannah. How about Johnny Smiles over there? Okay, stop. It could literally be anyone. Think about it. The girl of your dreams could be sitting at that table, and you would never even know about it. Where is your sense of mystery and romance, huh? And the two of you are really not gonna meet? - That is so sad. - We've decided not to ruin it. What if I've been prioritizing all the wrong things these years, huh? What if I'm finally realizing it's about what's on the inside? And what if on the outside, it's some 18-year-old kid messing with you from his grandma's basement, huh? I'm being serious, all right? Why risk losing a connection that we already have? By not being in the same room. Okay, enough about me. Are any of these guys doing it for you? These guys? Nah. I am happily single. Because you don't talk to the girl you like. Oh, wow. So, what happened to the sense of mystery and romance now? Wait, so there is someone. Maybe. Wait, do I know him? Not Dave from accounting. It's not like you don't see her every day. Well, if you must know, we talked this morning. - Really? - Mm-hmm. She said good morning to me. Oh, yeah? And? And I said good morning back to her. What? I feel like there was some unspoken communication going on there. What are you waiting for, man? Why don't you just go up to her and, you know, ask her if she wants to get some coffee or something? She probably doesn't even know that I exist. What do you think of Brad? What? You don't think he's cute? No, it's not that. So, what's the problem, then? No, it's just, you know, he's friends with... him. He'd probably say the same thing about us. True. Does it not bother you that she's, like, best friends with your archenemy? Archenemy? That's a little harsh, don't you think? You know, I think Jason's not such a bad guy once you get to know him. Well, that would require me getting to know him. Wouldn't it be better if you two could figure out a way to, you know, actually work together? Do you think would be better if you actually tell Hannah how you feel about her? So... about Brad... Why not? If it makes you happy. Glass houses, my friend. Yeah, glass houses. Now we have to find someone who makes you happy... in person. This is good, right? See you soon. Don't blow it. - Oh, no, no, no, I'm good. - Yes, yes, yes. This is one of the first bottles my father ever produced. - Really? - Mm-hmm. This is quite a remarkable story. He started all of this with a few vines in his humble backyard. Wow. I like to think there's a bit of his spirit in every bottle of Goodwin wine. To your father. B.J. Goodwin. Mmm. He liked to quote President Lincoln. "If given the truth, the people can be depended upon to meet any national crisis. The great point is to bring them the real facts and... wine." Is that what this is? Some kind of test? My dad also told me, "A good boss should get to know the folks he's working with." Or in this case, may very well work with. So, how do I convince you I'm the right woman for the job? I didn't bring you here to pitch me. - No? - Tell me about yourself. Well, I believe a good campaign should be about connecting with the consumer on an emotional level. Not your business strategy. You, the Alexa Parker story. Oh, okay, well, I was born in San Pedro. I went to college in San Francisco. - Mm-hmm. - And before he passed, my father spent his whole life in advertising, and all I've ever wanted to do was follow in his footsteps. Or be an astronaut. But I was lousy in science, so... Me too. You see? We're getting to know each other. If I get this promotion, it'll feel like I finally made it. You know, proven to him that I can do it. I'm sure he already knows. And you'll most certainly get your chance. Both of you. Hmm? Didn't realize it was a party. Wait, what are you doing here? I invited him. - Wait, what? - You're getting your turn, and I'm sure you'd certainly want him to get his. After all, there's no reason why this shouldn't be a fair contest, right? Right. Wait, you don't have to go. He's early. Oh, no, no, no. I have a lot of work to do in the morning, so I'll just leave you two to it. Thank you for the wine. I look forward to your pitch. Excuse me a minute? - Yeah. - Okay. Hey. Don't you two have some guy talk to get to? I didn't know he had us stacked like this tonight, okay? This is awkward for me too. Okay, so what is this, like a truce? We're under enough pressure as it is, don't you think? I overheard you talking to your mom today. Oh, yeah, don't worry about it. Well, it sounds like she really needs you. You bought a house, right? Between the mortgage and taxes, it's gonna cost a fortune. - Am I right? - Yeah. Yeah, that's what I'm talking about, Parker. There's no reason to make this any worse than it has to be. What has gotten into you? I don't know. Just... I guess I'm feeling more human lately. Yeah, well, better late than never, I guess. My ride's almost here. Oh, yeah, yeah. Get home safe. Thanks, Crawford. What? Hey, I wasn't sure you'd still be up. Actually, I just got out of a meeting. Now? It's kinda late, isn't it? I don't know. Why don't you ask your life coach what she thinks? Yeah, about that... I miss you, Alex. I'm sorry? I was hoping that we could maybe have lunch tomorrow? My treat. What, haven't you broken my heart enough already? Baby, just give me a chance to explain. One lunch. That's all I ask. I'll text you in the morning. Is that a yes? It's an "I'll text you in the morning." Okay, I'll talk to you when you... - What do you think? - Hmm. A lot of the wineries up here branching out into microbreweries now. Yeah? Yeah, I think it could work. Would expand your male clientele too. Mm-hmm. My father? Dead set against the idea. Yeah, my dad was conservative too. I'm actually kind of surprised he trusted me to run the place. My dad always told me I'd be a salesman or a talk show host. He may have been on to something. Oh, man, they sure do have a way about 'em, don't they? That's right. You know, for what it's worth, I think you've really done a great job with this place. It's a shame that he's not here to watch you take what he's created and really push it into the future. Yeah. Hey, to our dads. To our dads. So, you and Alexa... Alexa and you. No, no. Really? I thought I saw you guys have quite a moment over there. Her and I? No. Oil and water. Don't forget. That combination... can start quite a fire. Excuse me. Are you there? I really need to talk. Everything all right? Um... I'm not keeping you from anything important, am I? I don't know. I think a friend of mine might be in trouble. Oh, well... there are worse things to be in this world than a good friend. You better get out of here. - You sure? - Yeah, go on. Scram. Okay. - Thanks for understanding. - Yeah. It's me. Are you okay? I was leaving this work-drinks thing, and Perry FaceTimed me. You're kidding. You okay? I was pretty rocked at first, but then I remembered I can't control everything. Am I worrying about the wrong things again? Do not be in a hurry. The right man will come at last. Okay, Jane Austen. But how can you be so sure? You only know me from this, whatever this is. Because I can tell. I'd be shocked if someone didn't see that soon enough and treat you the way you deserve. Please tell me I didn't drag you away from anything important. I was actually at a work-drinks thing too. Don't worry about it. This was more important. You're sweet, and you're a really good friend. Sweet dreams, Her. Sweet dreams, Him. - Let me give you my number. - All right. Okay. Ohh... I'd better go see what's going on. Okay, no worries. See ya. - Bye. - See ya. What did you do? I told him I'd get back to him. - And then? - I hung up. You should've called me. I know. I thought about it, but... You texted Him. I couldn't help it. It was like a reflex. And you used to hate technology. I don't know. He's just... He's just a good person. You know, and he makes me laugh, and he's such a good listener. I mean, not that you aren't. He's my breakup whisperer. So, meet Him already. Hannah, seriously, I've never been friends with a guy where there's just no pressure. It's just natural with Him. Honest. Fun. If you say so. But speaking of pressure... Perry. I know. I mean, he did sound pretty sincere. And it's just lunch, right? You tell me. You made it. I made it. Never thought I'd come back here. Um, I took the liberty. I know you prefer red. Sporty spice. What's that? Uh, nothing. How's work? It's good. Still working on that promotion? Look, you didn't ask me here to talk about my job. Look, what's going on? I owe you a big apology, Alex. I was stupid. I was impulsive. I was wrong. Is this some kind of self-help exercise? Your life coach put you up to this too? I was scared, Alex. We had been together for 10 months. We were practically living together. I knew what the next step was supposed to be. But instead of making that commitment, I ran. Yeah. The truth is you're smart... you are beautiful... and yeah, sometimes I get intimidated by you, but that's okay. I just... I don't want a future that doesn't have you in it. Guess what. Hey. Perry asked me to take him back. He said he was sorry, that he really sees a future with me. Wow. That's really something. He asked me to go out with him tonight. Good for you. Really happy for you. Are you sure? You don't think it's a mistake, do you? No, really, it's great. You deserve this. Thanks for the update. Wait, are you mad? No, not at all. But I should get back to work now. Ooh. Here. Good as new. Can't believe I accidentally dropped it like that. Well, as my two-minute yoga app says, "Everything happens for a reason." If you say so, Trey. Um, hey, be glad it wasn't broken, though, because I gave my last new phone to Alexa last week. - Oh. - Yeah. - Alexa got a new phone? - Oh, yeah. Said she dropped her other one in a bucket of water or something. Anyway, if you think you're gonna drop it again, I have got some cases. Oh, I'm good. Thanks though. Curious. How are the numbers assigned on these? Company's got a whole block of numbers. They're all sequential. Why? You talk to Hannah? Mm-hmm. Guess who's going hiking with her this weekend? - Hoo-hoo! - Can I have her phone number? No. Slow down. I asked her first. Please. I need the number. All right. It's, uh... 555-0128. 5-0-1-8-2. Yeah, so? Two digits backwards. I got the last two digits of my best friend's phone number backwards. Are you good, man? Oh, boy. Jason? I still can't believe he broke up with me on my birthday. Oh, it's your birthday? I was leaving this work-drinks thing, and Perry FaceTimed me. I was actually at a work-drinks thing too. Alexa. It's her. - Hey, hot shot! - Yeah. Can you come here for a second, please? I just wanted to make sure that you were ready for tomorrow. What? Really? For the pitch. The winery, the promotion. Oh, yeah, yeah, I'm ready. Got it right here. Are you sure? 'Cause you seem a little... Yeah, no, I'm fine, I'm fine. Everything's here. I'm ready, prepared, ready to go. I couldn't help but notice that it's a little quiet around here. I thought there might have been a little bit of fireworks between you and Alexa before the big event. Yeah, I guess you could say that we've just been, um... dealing with each other a little differently lately. Well, as long as one of you gets that contract. Yeah. Then you guys can deal with each other however you want. Yeah. All right, good. Well, I will see you tomorrow. Yeah. Have a good night. Get some rest. I will. This place is really nice. I didn't even know it was here. It's actually a family business. Would you believe the father started in the backyard with just a few vines? - Wow. - Yeah. You know a lot about this place. Are they clients? Hopefully. Just can't stay away, huh? You're here! Perry, I want you to meet Craig, the owner. His father is the one who started the place. - Good to meet you. - Likewise. I was just telling Alexa what an amazing place you have here. Well, thank you. It's home. If you ever need help managing your financial portfolio... Well, that's good to know. - Please. - Yeah. Alexa, how are you feeling about tomorrow? I feel good. I feel like I've got some real solid ideas on how we can extend your father's legacy. Excellent. I must say, you and your colleague Jason are an intriguing pair. You seem to really spark off of each other. Nobody works harder than this lady, I can promise you that. No doubt. Now, listen, don't let me interrupt your evening. But remember, mi casa es su casa. Aw, thank you. It was nice meeting you. Thanks for tonight. Normally I'd be pacing my living room before a big pitch, especially with the stakes dangling over this one. I feel like I should be thanking you. - For what? - For giving me a second chance. Look... - I've been thinking. - Perry... I think we should get a place together. What? I'm at your place all the time as it is, or at least I was. Yeah, but I just bought the house. - I've just gotten settled. - Great. So, we can live there. I'll even help with the mortgage. What happened to not talking about the future? I'm done running away from commitment. Life is what happens when you're busy making other plans. What's that? Nothing. Just something a friend of mine said. Alexa Parker, are you learning to live in the moment? Maybe I'm just trying to make the best of it. You don't have to decide tonight, but... I don't want to lose you again. Hey. So, how did your date go? He wants us to move in together. Wow. That was fast. Funny thing is, two weeks ago, I would've killed for this kind of commitment. But not now? I mean, I should be happy, right? Yeah. Something wrong? Just a little surprised, that's all. Why? Because of the way he treated you. What do you mean? My heart feels like it's been torn out of my chest, thrown on the floor and stomped on. Ring any bells? You're the one who said someone would come along and treat me right. I know, but this guy? Wait, don't you want me to be happy? Very much. I think there's something real here, between you and me. What if it's too late? I think we should meet. I need to think about this. Good night. Good night, Parker. Goodwin Wines isn't just about wine. Goodwin Wines is about more than just wine. Okay, I want to talk about family. No, no. Um... Let's talk about family. Classic wine doesn't mean you can't have new customers. Classic wine doesn't mean you can't have new customers. Classic wine... doesn't mean you can't have new customers. Hey. How'd it go last night? Uh, with Perry. Oh, right. Uh, Perry. Uh, it's fine. I knew he would come around eventually. You're just too good to pass up. Right. What's wrong? - It's Him. - Oh. You know, the guy I've been texting with. I told Him I went out with Perry last night, and I don't know, he got all weird about it. I feel bad. Because you wish it was Him. You need to decide what you want. A longtime boyfriend who wants to take next step, or some guy you messaged by mistake, who you may never actually meet. I mean, you two are definitely made for each other. Hey. Hey. There's something I wanted to say. Yeah. Good luck. Oh. Oh, yeah, yeah. Good luck to you too. Okay, okay, what is going on? With... what exactly? Well, you just haven't been acting like yourself. Isn't that a good thing, considering how you feel about me? Okay, first you call truce, then you don't park in my spot for the first time in weeks, but then I see you getting all buddy-buddy with Craig right before our pitches. It's not what it looks like. - Yeah, go ahead, deny it. - Look... there's something that you need to know. You don't think I know what you're doing? You're trying to get my head, and it's not gonna work. - If you'd just let me finish. - No! I'm not gonna let you trip me up. You know what, Crawford? No matter how this pitch goes today, when this is all done, I never wanna talk to you again. So, if you look here... Mm-hmm, yeah. - I wanna show you... - Yes. Okay, who wants to go first? I think Alexa should go first. Alexa? - Yeah. - Great. And finally, I want to talk about family. Your father would be so proud with how you've grown this business. As someone once said, there's a little bit of his spirit in every bottle of Goodwin wine. And I want the consumer to connect with that spirit. When you're invited to someone's house for dinner, what do you bring? A nice bottle of wine. When you go to your best friend's house for a nice quiet evening, what do you bring? A nice bottle of wine because you need that special touch only wine can provide, because Goodwin wine... is good for the heart. Thank you for that, Alexa. That's a tough act to follow. Yeah. Good. I was gonna come up here and do my thing. You know, talk fast, throw around a bunch of empty words like "value," "advantage," "demographics." But although it looks like I'm in complete control... I'm not. What are you doing? I've always said that thinking you can be in control of anything is nothing but a pipe dream. After all, Allen Saunders famously said, "Life is what happens while you're busy making other plans." What if Allen Saunders was wrong? Maybe it's not just about living in the moment. Maybe you need to be invested. Like her. She's smart, driven... organized, meticulous. You'd be fortunate to have her on your team. I'm confused. When you saw me talking to Craig this morning... I was telling him he'd be a fool not to go with you. That's true. So... congratulations. I really like that young man. I have no idea what just happened in there, but what you did was really special. Yeah, well, she's better than me. She deserves it. Do you remember what I told you in that first meeting? Yeah, that we bicker like your parents. And that your competitive nature brings out the best in both of you. I couldn't have chosen one of you over the other. But together, I knew you'd make magic. And what I just saw in there proves it. You guys are gonna make a great team. I'm not sure Alexa would agree with that. Maybe, maybe not. Congratulations, co-director. - Thank you. - You're welcome. Can we talk about this? I'm sorry. But I'm not sorry it turned out to be you on the other end of this. I miss you. I can't believe you're Him. Yeah. I didn't see that coming either. A few weeks ago, a few days ago, I'm pretty sure I hated you. Yeah. We just didn't know each other. But now we do? Look, I have questions. Okay. Like... how long have you known? Uh, I figured it out a couple days ago. Trey told me the numbers were sequential. I asked Brad for Hannah's number and saw that it was the exact same as mine... - ...except for the last two numbers. - The last two numbers. Well, aren't you clever. No. If I was clever... I would have seen it a long time ago. Would have seen what? That I love you. You what? You heard me. I mean, what happened to no names, no work talk, no reason to lie? I made other plans. Well, then say it again. I love you. Do you love me... We should probably get to work now, co-director. Oh, look at this. It's gone to her head already. I'm just glad I was around so you could ride on my coattails. And another thing: We need to talk about the parking situation. Just because you're upwardly mobile now doesn't mean you get to park in any spot you want. So you have to walk a couple of spaces. It's not that big a deal. You're always concerned with the wrong things. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
