Good evening, Mrs. Hicks. I'm calling about invoice number 137. There's a balance due of $365 and 17 cents. We sent a copy in the envelope with your order. Did you receive your order? I do have your PO number right here. It's 137.. I'm sorry to hear that. But I'm gonna have to report to my supervisor and let him know your intentions in regards to this past due invoice. Well you have until the 13th, so enjoy your day. Wait, Mrs. Hicks? Can I ask you a question? How long have you lived in Denver? Really? Wow, that's a long time. Don't you ever feel like you just wanna... leave? Just let me do it. Here you go. I don't think I'll be coming over anymore. Oh fuck. Do you think that maybe you can just turn it back on for tonight and I can literally come in tomorrow morning with a check for you guys or? Okay. All right. Well, thank you. Thank you for your help. Hey Kenny. Audrey? Hey, oh sweet. Well I have to talk to you about something. Yeah. Kenny's been complaining about the noise and he said, okay. He says that you've been- Fornicating? That's it. I don't think it's gonna be a problem anymore. Glad to hear it. Hey mom. Yeah, things are going really great. I just... I've just been you know, working and you know I'm not seeing anyone right now. But... Happy Mother's Day. Hello, call me the regular way. This is Teddy one of our North American Porcupines. You don't do good phone work. I disagree. That's what it says here. It says you better not dealing directly with people. But that's not true. I'm really nice to people. I'm sure you are. I just don't have any- What else does it say? I'm terribly sorry but we're gonna have to let you go. Okay, cool. Got it. Thank you so much. You enjoy your day. You too. Audrey hey it's Warren I'm supposed to call it hang on Jesus I know If you want someone to do something you can just say it and then you can let them do it. You don't have to keep yelling at them. Sorry, I'm sorry Audrey You have to get the rent it's normal to do that and it's really late. It's Warren, OK bye. Okay so, I just adopted a dog and I think it's already one of the best decisions I've ever made. We had a sleep over the first night before I adopted him. And he's literally the perfect dog. Look at that face how can you resist? Surprisingly, there's a lot of older dogs who are in need of a new family to love them. Most older dogs make wonderful- Adoptions create families. And the desire for a family is something we never lose. No matter how old we are. Adult adoption is on the rise and it is creating families all over the world. If you're ready to start the search for your forever family please visit our website at adult adoption. Hi there, I've never had any kids. My wife and I are kind of lonely here. And I think it'd be helpful for us to have someone it's a funny thing, how it came about. We were thinking about going to the humane society and picking out an animal. The reason why I would like to adopt somebody is because I feel it's very possible that many of us have been in families in other lives. And that it's possible that we might meet one of those family members in this life. But I think I could share some joy with an adult who maybe has never had these things either. If you're an adult who is looking for an adoptive mother, feel free to get in- Hi, my name's Audrey. And I'm looking to be adopted. It was really nice watching your video and I hope that we get to meet. Wishing you the best over here by the river. Thanks. Bye. So um I used to garden. But I don't anymore because of the arthritis now. No not in five years. I mean, we have so much in common. The music thing for starters how many people really like Dixieland Jazz? I know they say they do but they don't. Actually we don't like jazz at all. We're just being polite. Wheat toast and some water please. Audrey? Ted. Is Nancy coming. Nancy. Your wife? Oh, she's parking the car. Parking is pretty bad around here, I guess. I'm really excited about this Audrey. I'm excited too. So you want a daddy? Hello, my name is Sunny. I've never had children, but over the years I've watched people who do I've seen so much misunderstanding in families. I think that if parents can try to understand that the things they say can mean so much to their children even little things can mean something big. If I was ever lucky enough to be a parent, I'd be the kind of parent who thinks about what they say to their child. And is kind. Hi Audrey? I'm Sunny. Hi. You didn't have to bring anything. Oh we don't have to eat it. Come in. It smells good. That's the cumin. Have a seat. Would you like some tea? I had a boss once who told me I should be on medication. I think he was trying to help. But I don't know. Did you take his advice? No, no. I don't want to mess with my brain. Oh, do you mind if I charge my phone? Here, I'll do it for you. Thanks. What kind of job was it? What? The one with the boss and the medication. Oh God, I don't even remember I've had so many jobs. You move around? I do. You're a seeker. Time for dinner? Otto, this is Audrey. Nice to meet you. Hmm. Words Otto. Hello. What is this? Audrey brought it. Wasn't that nice? I made spaghetti. We will have spaghetti. Dinner will be ready soon Otto why don't you tell Mutti. Hmm. Mutti is Otto's mother. He has two children, Gretchen and John. Otto calls him Johan, but everybody else calls him John. Otto is very traditional. It's nice. Do they live nearby? Yes, but we hardly see them. They have their own lives. Otto and I met online. We both lost our spouses. So there was nothing bad... It wasn't that kind of online. Right I have to tell you something Audrey. Otto doesn't know why you're here. I'm sorry. I was gonna tell him but I didn't know how. Hi, Audrey, this is Sunny. I'd love to meet you. And if things work out I would love for you to join our family. I'm sorry Otto, I should have told you. So your parents are still alive? What's wrong with them? Why do you need this strange thing? Is she here about the cable? We don't have cable Mutti. Television is bad enough without the cable. You're missing nothing. The internet? Endless sickening pablum. It could be a good source for news. What news? The world is still a stinking mess. God is still dead. Some sites can be educational. I don't know if you guys hadn't gone to the internet you wouldn't have met, right? Hmm. This is really delicious. Sunny, thank you. Otto's an engineer. Seriously? Yah. I am retired from NASA. Oh, cool. What were you doing there? Do you have a degree in aeronautical engineering? No. So how would you expect to understand it? She's just trying to be polite Otto. Otto and his son have a difficult relationship. He does get along a little better with his daughter though. Johan lives his life as if there are no other people. What kind of man calls at dinner time. How old are you? Mutti die stille! Don't listen to her she's almost blind. Also she's losing her mind. These symptoms are to be expected as an individual nears death. Tell Otto where you were before. I was working in Montana I was at this little resort and I was a cook. How long you were there? Well, it was a seasonal job. So it's about three months. How long have stayed in Saugerties? Pretty long like I think it's a year now. That's a long time? For me it is. What brought you here? I was visiting a friend. What happened to the friend? I don't know. Audrey was raised in California. The beaches. The warm sand. We lived really kind of far from the beach only went there a couple times. How do you like it here Audrey? I like it. I like the river. It's very deep. This is what enabled whaling vessels to sail up from the ocean. Whales? Yah! In 1766, the British parliament placed a duty on whale oil shipped to Britain. So a group of whalers in Nantucket disassembled their houses and used them to make ships they then sailed them up the Hudson River. Two miles from here they disassembled their ships and reassembled their houses to create a village. We now know as Hudson. So they actually dragged the whales up the river? No. First they stripped the blubber. It's known as flensing. The remainder of the carcass was discarded in the open ocean. Sunny I've finished eating. It is time to play. What are we playing? Pretty sad looking tree house you've got there. It was there when we moved in. Sunny your hips are not aligned. That's good now go the other way. Oh good shot. Come on Mutti You are sane approximately. A sane as you are. So We will call this an experiment. Sunny and I are taking Mutti to Bavaria in the fall to see our old farm before she expires. So we're gonna conduct this experiment until then and at that time we will assess the results. Perhaps it will continue. Perhaps it will be conclusive, yah. Sounds like a plan. Of course the farm is now a shopping mall. We'll take her to another place and tell her it's the actual farm. You don't think she's gonna notice? Today I'm gonna walk you guys through doing acrylic on windows and that is kinda what's up with this glow right back here this is actually blue and I'll show you guys pictures of the whole thing afterwards but just a couple tips before we get started. Hey. Hey. What's going on? Oh just getting off work. Is that biodegradable? The paint? Yeah. Yeah, absolutely. Don't let any get on the tomatoes. Got it. You know it's the seventh, right? Yeah. I'm on it. At the tone, please record your message. When you've finished recording you may hang up or press one for more. Hey guys, it's me Audrey. I was just calling to say hello and hope everything's going well. And, um And dad I just wanted to check in and see how you were. So Yeah! Just give me a call whenever you can. All right, things are going really good here. So I'll talk to you soon. All right, bye. I call this MIYM chicken. It means melt in your mouth. I hope you like it. It looks great. It's very moist. What's the matter with her? I'm fine I'm fine. Otto would you go see if she's all right. A woman should go. I think I have like a stomach flu or something. You don't have the flu. Children sometimes unburden themselves to their parents. Yeah, so I've heard. Still I'm objectively interested in your difficulties. My dad ran over my pet chicken when I was eight. It wasn't his fault. It just he was backing out of the garage and he just ran her over. I've heard of this happening to cats and dogs. No somebody got me an incubator and two fertilized eggs and one just sat there. And the other one hatched. And I had her for like a year and a half. It was responsive to affection. My own father was a professor. He knew nothing about farming, but in Germany after the war, there was no food. He was forced to learn to raise sheep. We were told that we were not to become fond of the lambs because they were to eat. So We will not serve chicken while you are here. Thank you. Emotions. You have grandkids right? Two. They are seldom here. They'd really like a tree house. Would they? Yeah, they would. Hey I'm Bobby I like to make stuff. Today we're gonna start building a tree house. This is gonna be a two part video. And in the first part we're gonna build a big sturdy platform and in the second part we'll make it look really cool. It's hard sometimes we must take care of our parents. I'll see you later Otto. No. First we must unload the lumber. You know I can stay with her sometimes if you want. You may have heard there's a smooth service called the horizon, out of which nothing can escape. You may have also read there's something called the singularity of the center of a black hole where everything is crushed into an infinitesimally. Small infinitely dense point. Even these two simple facts are likely wrong or at least more complicated. But nobody knows for sure. If only we had the cable. Inside there to be a ball of string. There could be an incredibly compact star. You've done this before? Shh. Hey Hi. Did you guys have a nice time? Sunny give me two minutes to prepare. A hamburger you can put it in the microwave. Thanks. Good night. Good night. Audrey its mom. You call us again and again and then when I call you back you can't pick up? What the fuck is wrong with you. You gotta be available when we reach out. Come in. Here are the tools. You know how to use them? Yeah, I know how to use a lot of things. I see. You're trying to induce me to say that a woman can't operate power tools no? No I just sort of expected to be said that's all. I imagine you do, for a moment I considered that then I thought she's an honest person. She wouldn't tell me she can use them if she couldn't. My son one time expressed interest in power tools. And then we went to a hardware store bought all of this. You know how to use them? No. Sons want fathers to do these things, don't they? I think they just want fathers to hang out with them. I'm not a man who hangs out. Go on, open the next. Okay. Now I'm retired. Now I'm hanging out. And in this hanging out I discovered a curious effect of deceleration. There are now gaps between my activities. These gaps allow me to experience regret. For example, activity I wasn't a father. Activity I was not a husband. Activity, I was a man who worked too much. Activity, I was a man who grew angry. It's nauseating. All right, shall we get to work? You ever built a tree house before? Yeah. So shall we say we will complete it by the 4th of July so the grandchildren can enjoy it. We? Hi Dad I'm just um I'm actually building a tree house right now. Because he only had two worms. Hey Kenny. Hey, Audrey, it's Warren. Maybe you got my message that I left. You have to pay the rent. It's time to do that now. And can you just pay it? I'll just knock again. I can lower the rent, like a hundred dollars. I can ask my mom. Thanks Warren it's okay. You know its time to go. I gotta go. For your mom? Okay. When am I gonna get the deposit back? Well we can see what's left after I refinish the floors. I'm sure it'll be fine. Cool. Sunny! Sunny the wind is predicted to rise to twelve knots At three forty five. So, we have to finish the pie by two. So, there is time to enjoy the Fat Daddy. He's nervous. His kids are coming. How can I help? I can peel those if you want. Why don't you go help Otto. Of course. You need some help? Some of these balls of fire can be unpredictable. You have to be prepared. Okay. Got it. Sunny, she seems all right? Yeah I think so. Happy Fourth of July, Johan. John. He's my son. The marinate is a little sticky. So you might wanna grease the grill. So is your sister coming? Gretchen should be here soon. She has to celebrate with her ex's family first. Sounds complicated. It's a much better situation now. Otto loves his fireworks. I know who calculates the wind age prior to ignition? The wind age? That's the correct term. Johan do not under cook the steaks. Ay you Kraut bastard. How'd your parents die Audrey? My parents aren't dead. Then why are we adopting you? Guys can we leave her alone? She has enough problems. So what's up with the tree house? Audrey's rebuilding it. Oh is that something you know how to do? Yeah. She's highly skilled. Can I go up there? It's too dangerous. It'll be safe after I finish it. I promise. Well, better, late than never. We gave up trying to get Otto to fix that tree house a long time ago. There was never time. We're driving down to the Cape in Florida Monday there will be a launch. It's gonna be a long drive. 16 hours. Wow. Will you stay at a hotel? No lift off is at dawn. We leave the morning before, we watch the launch then we drive home. Sunny enjoys the roar of the first stage separation. I really do. There is blood in the steaks, Johan. John. If there is blood. There's still bacteria. Do you know we're nothing without bacteria. Otto it's all over our skin Honey. Everyone give the steaks to me. Honey, please. I'm going to finish cooking them correctly. Give it to me All of them, all of them. Give to me. I'm leaving. Go let him show you how to make the meat. Where's the thermometer? It'll make him happy. Doubtful. I have the thermometer. Okay. If you don't go, we're all gonna be miserable. So take one for the team. Johan you never put it near the bone. Bone is much more conductive than tissue. It gives a false reading. There's no bone in these. Someday there will be bone. You'll know what to do. Audrey why don't you go to the Cape with Otto the blast is incredible. Yeah he can teach you all about aeronautics on the way down. You never know. You might find it interesting. And if not you could pretend. The steaks are ready? I think they're done. They are not. They're fucking hockey pucks. All right, I need to check on the pudding. Can I help you? And watery diarrhea. Dump the scheisse. Enjoy. I want to go inside now. Danke. Remote? Want to get something to eat? Something with a lot of bacteria. You buying? Wow. How do you like my father? I think Otto's great. Has he taken you fishing yet? No. I didn't know he fished. Well he doesn't, but when he takes you fishing he'll set you up at the end of the pier and then he'll sit down and count the number of casts you make. And when you've hit 26, it'll be time for you to go. Whether or not you caught a fish. Why 26? He did a time and motion study and determined that if you don't catch a fish after 26 casts that you never will. Once I figured out the system then I'd wait longer and longer in between each cast because I wanted it to last. At least he you took you fishing. It's nice. During the summer months when ticks are most active. But first thing you can do is wear light colored clothes. If you're gonna come across a tick you're gonna wind up being able to see that tick crawling on your pants or crawling on your shirt. Even better than that would be if you're wearing socks you can tuck those pants into your socks. Ooh. No, you're right. Cause it'd be like incest. Stop talking. We could go to one of those states where it's legal or at least they look the other way. Just stop saying words. You're not gonna drive, right? No. Good. Good times. Yeah. Johan. Oh shit. Johan where did you take her? He just took me to get some food. You have been drinking. Why is it that immigrants have more respect for the national holiday? What are you talking about Otto? You are having a celebration and you left. I actually really like the 4th of July. I just thought you and Sunny needed a little space. We are not going to the Cape. Otto his name is John. He prefers John. He's a nice guy. What's that mean? Is that what a man wants on his grave marker he was a nice guy? Better to say he was adequate. It's not safe to drive with him. John? No in general. You must be vigilant. Also it's a holiday. People drink. They fire guns in the sky. Otto I've been taking care of myself for pretty long now. Listen to me, the world is dangerous. I'm talking to you as if you are my child. I've forgotten. How disagreeable that is. Hi it's Warren's phone. Please call me back. I mean, I will call you back when you leave a message here. Thank you. Okay, bye. Hey Warren, it's Audrey. I really need my security deposit back. And if I could get it in cash, that would be preferable. Just call me when you can or you can text me and we can meet up. I hope you're well. If you have ever thought about moving to Vermont Governor Phil Scott just signed a law that may make it a little more enticing workers who move to Vermont and make it their home will be eligible for up to $10,000 in moving expenses and other costs. State officials hope that the money and Vermont's high quality of life will lure out of state workers to trade their office work. You coming up? Yeah. Looks like there's much more work to do. No, I'm actually almost finished. No this section, for example requires more support here. It will stabilize it. Otto I don't have any more lumber. You can get more. If I did that all the way around. That's another like day, two days of work. Oh three, I think. And you have pride in your labor. All right. Lithium is present only under the salt plains of Bolivia some day it will run out. Which is why another battery material is needed. Manufacturers are not willing to knowledge this. What the fuck? Hey Audrey. Hi So I brought the money. My deposit, thank you. Yeah, it's in cash like you asked. I needed this. Where do you live now? Just you know, around. I'm fine. I'm on my way out of town actually going to be leaving soon. I'm just ready. You ever feel like that? Where you're just ready to see something else. I mean volcanoes But I live here. It's my home. But you could live anywhere. Your home could be anywhere. Not really. It's where you live, where your family lives. Me and my mom live here. Yeah I get it. I would rather that you didn't leave. Thank you, Warren. What do you have there? I brought you some tomatoes, from my tomato garden. Thanks. Here you go. I did this whole thing for Otto. I figured that. I'm sorry I misled you. Okay. You'll be leaving soon? I hate rockets. Really? You can tell. Oh yeah. Audrey. You found me. Yeah. Sunny, she told me you are leaving. Do I smell cumin? You want some? Yeah. Good Sit down. I see that you have prior experiences. The wheels come off every now and again. And I do this for a bit and then I get things back on track. So you will finish the tree house before you go? This is for you. Mutti give it to me. It was to help me sleep. Shouldn't you give that to like Gretchen or John? They say this is music for Nazis. My parents were not Nazis. This helped you sleep? Of course not. Listen to it. One of the awesome things about living here in Vermont has been just the number of friendships I've been able to establish. So today's gonna be a big day for doing some work on the barn. The term meteor in fact refers to the streak of light caused by a meteoroid as it collides with the upper regions of the earth atmosphere. Most of meteoroids are only the size of a grain of sand. Is that right? Space dust. Measure twice cut once. We're here. Hey. We're finishing up the tree house for my grandchildren. I told you they can't go up there. Audrey is making it safe. It's more than sufficient to meet the demands of the County Building Code. Tree houses don't have building codes. If there was, it would pass there's no doubt. Sorry can you stop that. When you were a child, you often asked me to fix it. Yes, I did. Look at it now you can use it. Fuck. I cannot understand when she was a child. She was the stable one, a fixed particle. Maybe you should go talk to her. Is that appropriate. Yeah, it's appropriate. What do I say? Just go in there and listen to her and try not to teach her anything. Hey Audrey? Fuuuuck! Fuck! Fuck! Are you okay? Goddammit you little fucker. Hey what did you just call him? What the fuck? What is the matter with you? Oh my God. Oh shit. My finger I don't know where it is. Right there get in the house in the house? Oh God. I'll get the first aid kit. We need the big one. I think it's time for me to go. Yeah Yeah Scheisse Where are you going now? I have some friends in Vermont who are her barn is needing some repair. How will you do that? You're missing a finger. Do you have insurance? I will pay. This is an emergency room Otto. They fix you whether you can pay or not. That's how it works. What do we got here? We got a finger. You sure do. Let's see what we can do with it. Good. It's gonna be a really long time Otto. I think you should probably go home. I will wait. It's okay if you come in. You're her dad, right? Just go home. Hey mom. Hi Audrey. Come in. Who has a shot at a million the rest can still win the overall but they would get on the grid, the riders in the game, 22 but there's only one with a shot at a million dollars. And that's Eli Tommack he has to win this race right here to continue that quest to a million. Can he do it again he did it last year. How about the Toyota Whole shot it's the rider whose been out for 16 months. And then just like the 64. How are the kids? I don't have kids. Hey Dad Why did you and mom get married? She had air conditioning. Makes sense. Can I tell you something about me dad? I move around a lot. In the past two years, I've lived in four different places. I've had like six, seven different jobs. I get someplace and it's great. Things are working out and then they just stop working out. I think once people get to know everything about me I just got to keep moving. Why do I do that? I don't know. I was driving to the library to return "A Theories on Dark Matter." And I saw your minivan. It's a distinctive car. Yes it is. May I see it. Yeah. Is there nerve damage? I mean I can't feel a thing. Careful around hot objects. It will burn before you're aware of it. I know Otto. You didn't go to Vermont. No. No, I was already to go and packed up. I came in here to get some propane and I saw they're hiring. So I thought I'd give the old staying put, a try. See what that was like. And what is it like? So far so good. I like it here. Do you have friends? I'm working on it To have friends is crucial to regulating blood pressure. So? Yeah.
