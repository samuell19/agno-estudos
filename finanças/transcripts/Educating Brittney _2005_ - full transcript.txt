[MUSIC PLAYING] Yes, ma'am. You need to tag that and insert into your CGI script. Ma'am, there's no need to use obscene language. No, ma'am. I'm trying to help. I know your subscription codes aren't working. If you'll just insert the code. Ma'am, you don't have to yell. I'm just trying to help. Please don't use foul language, ma'am. Ma'am? Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you. Jesus, what a bitch. She's just frustrated. Yeah, well, now I'm frustrated too. Ah, you know better. Come on, Mark. OK, Baker. Why do you get all the easy calls? Who says they're easy? Look, you're customer support only. You don't have to sleep with them. Tell that to my wife. Mm, ah. The true problem surfaces. I think I've got the seven-year itch. Seven years, huh? So fix it. It's not bad, it's just-- Dull. She's a dead lay, Baker. Well, familiarity usually breeds contempt. So why don't you just spice it up a little bit? Got a magic wand? You ever think about watching your wife have sex with another man? No. You're a liar. Here. It's a special place. It's private. If you tell anyone, I'll have to kill you. What's this? Consider it a gift to a friend. You have to have a mask, and the rule is it's totally anonymous. [BUZZ] Your wife is here. What? Do you think we're getting old? Is this about sex? Yeah. Why would you ask that? Have you ever wanted to do another guy? You're making me uncomfortable. I'm just wondering. Why? No reason. You think we're getting dull? I still think my wife is hot, but-- But I'm a dead fuck. It's just the same thing all the time. Thanks a lot. Anna, what are you doing? Is this what you want? Am I a dead fuck now? I never said that. But you implied it. That was an excellent temporary fix. Temporary, huh? So what would make it permanent? I don't know, but there is this place that Baker was talking about. It's like a club or something. I'm not swinging. He says it's nothing like that. It's like therapy or something. Therapy? It's like a spa or something. Baker isn't exactly the country club type. He says it's really unique. OK, Mark. Let's go get some therapy. Cool. But we've got to get some masks first. Masks? For a spa? [MUSIC PLAYING] What are we supposed to do now? I don't know. You know you don't have to go directly home tonight. Is this club going to become an obsession? You have to admit it was enlightening. Maybe. You seemed to enjoy it. It was OK. It doesn't really seem to do anything for us. It could. What are you suggesting? I have a little fantasy I've never really told you about. Should I be worried? I think it would be amazing to see you making love with another man. What? It would be a turn-on. Me with another man? Yeah. Do you think that's strange? I don't know what to think. Where would you be while I'm being fucked by this other guy? Watching. In the same room? Yeah. This is really weird. Not necessarily. Why? Do you want to do another woman? No. You just want me to have sex with another man. You just want to be in the same room watching me get fucked? Yeah, that'd be the best. Would you do it? I don't know. Would you consider it? Maybe. [MUSIC PLAYING] It's getting to be overwhelming. Well, that's natural. That's actually to be expected. I know. But it's like I have to see my wife getting fucked by somebody else. Why? She's so beautiful to me. It's like if I videotape us, it's not the same. I mean, I'd be like criticizing my own fat ass or something. So you want to see her having sex with an outsider? Yeah, that would be really hot. Then do it. You think she's game? She says she'd consider it. That means yes. I know. It's a lot of pressure. Doesn't have to be. Most wives would dream of this opportunity. Just find a guy you want and have him. It would have to be just right, nobody we know. So you would consider doing it. I don't want to play this game anymore. Why not? I don't want to talk about it. I'm not going. So now that we're making progress, you're not in? You're obsessed, Mark. I'm not obsessed. You're going to the Hot Wives Club tonight, aren't you? Yeah. Well, I'm not. So you'd better reconsider. [MUSIC PLAYING] Andre, you are a devil, aren't you? I would say you are the devil, my dear Dominique. And you are my demon, you bad boy. Since your poor, departed husband left us, I need a new hobby. Two years later than he should have. And now that our affair is no longer secret, what are we to do? Oh, I am so sorry, miss. I didn't know you were still home. It's all right, Brittney. You can go about your chores. Yes, mum, as you wish. So then you are the teacher. Well, then class is in session. What do you mean by that, my dearest Dominique? Oh, come on. A challenge, please. There she is, your next conquest. You must be joking. It would take me a whole five minutes with that one. Then you accept my challenge? And the stakes? Money? Dares? Nothing as trivial as those. Then you'd best not bet too heavy. This one will break your bank. DOMINIQUE: Love. Love? And what do you mean by that? Anything and everything, for however long I want, as long as I want it. Anything? Everything? Wherever, whenever, however, for as long as I demand. Oh, you are a devil. But soon I will be in command of that pleasure. I am awaiting your lesson, teacher. Miss Parker, you didn't introduce me to your friend. My apologies. This is my handmaiden, Brittney. Brittney, this is-- I'm Andre, a former associate of Mr. Parker. Pleased to meet you, Brittney. Brittney has been in our services for some five years now. Six, mum. Such great service. I'm honored to meet you. Yes, and her husband has been our driver for equally as long. Husband? A very lucky, lucky man. We met when I started working here. We attended the wedding before my husband died. Thank you so much, mum. Your gift was so much more than we deserved. m don't thank me. Thank my husband. It was his gift. I must meet your husband, Brittney. Please join us for dinner, won't you? Oh, no. I'm sorry. I couldn't. Nonsense. I insist. I must meet the man who won the heart of such a beautiful woman. I'm not sure-- He must tell me how to win the heart of a woman. I would ever be the richer for his advice. BRITTNEY: I couldn't impose. ANDRE: I'm sure Dominique wouldn't mind company, would you. mum? Of course not. I, too, would like to see how a man wins a woman these days. Then it's settled. 6 o'clock. Oh, OK. If you will excuse me. [MUSIC PLAYING] Should have seen your face when I said the word 'husband.' Oh, really? And how was that? Like you'd seen a ghost. A trifling matter. Husband or not has never been an issue. But you forget one thing. What's that? That she's poor. That will only make it 10 times easier. Not true. That's what's going to make you fail. I am wealthy. It will lure her quicker. You're wrong. Her poverty prevents her from boredom. And how is that? She loves her husband. Why else would she marry a limo driver? You know what? Save your strength. You're going to need it from when I win. Funny, I was just about to say the same. Why don't you go to the maid's quarters and check on Betty? Excellent idea. I could use the practice for when Brittney gets here. Oh, Mr. Barrington, I was just about to get started. Please, Betty, call me Andre. Sure, Mr. Andre. I've been watching you for weeks. I've been watching you, too. When I see you I can't help but think of us. I don't know what to say. Then don't. Let's not talk now. Come sit. Your feet must be incredibly sore. [MUSIC PLAYING] Five years of service to Bill, that's very honorable. Mr. Parker was a generous man. I know all too well. When Brittney and I first told Bill that we were going to be married, I offered to resign. Resign? What on Earth for? Well, both of us working in the same place, I thought it would be best. But Bill would have nothing to do with breaking them up. How romantic. So he let you stay employed? Yes, he was very kind to us. If I only had half the luck as you, I'd have found love by now, too. Pardon me, Mr.-- I mean, Andre, I'm sure there is a million women who would die to be with you. If only it were so. I just can't seem to find anyone who wants me for me. But sir, I mean, Andre, you have money, security-- And you're very good looking, too. Really? You think so? You're not just saying that to patronize my loneliness, are you? No, no. Not at all. There's not a woman in the world that would say otherwise. Brittney, you're far too kind to an old romantic. Tell me, Gregory, how do you win the affection of such a perfect woman as Brittney? Well, with a man as stunningly as good looking as Gregory, I see exactly why she fell for him. What do you say we play that game of Truth Or Scandal you brought? Let me get it, Brittney. You're my guest. Come on, Andre. Yes, we insist. You two go enjoy the patio view. We'll join you later. I saw the look you gave him. What gives? I've upped the stakes. New game. The old game isn't finished. It is now. You might get Brittney, but I'll get him first. No way. What's wrong? Afraid I can't do it? You're making this easy for me. But deal, you'd better win because I'm very demanding with my pleasures. I was just about to say the same thing. Can you even imagine having this much money? It would be the life. Yeah, a house for every season. I never thought of Dominique as this friendly. I wonder why the sudden friendship. Who cares? She's a good friend to have with all that money. I don't care about the money. I have you. Then let's make love, right here. What if they come? They're going to be a while. We have time. OK. [MUSIC PLAYING] You see? Love makes you blind. It'll make my victory that much sweeter. Shall we play partners? That sounds like fun. Well, then I get to choose my partner. My house, my rules. Then whom shall you choose, mum? I think we should break it up a bit. I'll take Gregory. You may have Brittney. What a great idea, if you'll have me, Brittney. Of course. I must warn you, I'm terrible at these games. [MUSIC PLAYING] Oh, Gregory, you are a card to be sure. Well, we are winning, Andre. One more and it's over. Love Secrets, my favorite card. Would you have an indiscretion with your employer if it would be guaranteed the best sexual experience of your life? Come on, old man. Come clean with the truth. Well, since my wife and my employer are both in the room, the answer is no, of course. Even if it proved to be the best experience you've ever had and no one would ever know about it? Not if you loved your wife. No, I don't think I would. You don't think, but you're not sure. No. I said no. Well I would. I think it would be incredibly erotic. Well, any more debate? Let's vote. I'll go first. I believe anyone married to this jewel would never. I'll go. I think it would be incredibly erotic. Andre's right. I would never do that to my wife. Your turn, love. You break the tie. Do you believe him? Well, then we win. Good game. And your honor remains intact. I need some fresh air. Excellent idea. Winners clean up? Fair enough. I'll join you shortly. Come on, Brittney. The patio is lovely at sunset. I sense Gregory's resolution wasn't as strong as you expected. Well, he's a man. It's to be expected. I don't think so. When you own the world, you don't throw it away for nothing. You're going to make me blush. Let's just enjoy the sunset, shall we? As friends. , [MUSIC PLAYING] Shouldn't we be cleaning up the board? I think you were really lying about that last answer. Well, a man is a man, but I couldn't do that to my wife. I love her. Come with me. I want to get your opinion about something. You've probably never seen this part of the house. No, I've never stepped foot inside the beach house, only the manor. This is my private room. Not even my husband has been here. Oh. You wanted my opinion on something? Yes. I bought something and I want to know what a man thought of it. What do you think? It's beautiful. I'm sorry, but I won't cheat on my wife. I didn't think that you would, but I always get what I want. Miss, if you want me to resign, I understand. $100,000. What? I'll pay you $100,000 to make love with me. I'm sorry, but I can't. I love Brittney. I'm not saying that you don't. It'll be our secret. I'm sorry, but I can't. $200,000. Nobody will know. Why? No man is worth that. Look, I married my husband for $100 million. $200,000 is nothing to me. It's a house to you. And no one would know? I'll have my lawyers find a lost provision in the will. Tell me, dear, how did Gregory win your heart? It was easy. He's a gentleman. Like you, really. Now you're patronizing me. No, really. You are a gentleman. Well, I try to be when I'm around you. Now you're patronizing me. Brittney, you are so beautiful. I'm sorry for being so forward. Please, Andre. I'm married. If you weren't, would you find me handsome? Yes, very. But I am. I'm sorry. [MUSIC PLAYING] Where have you two been? Oh, we were just talking about Mr. Parker and how generous he's been. Yes, very. Well, we should be going. No, not at all. Stay. Let's have coffee. I don't want to impose. Impose? Nonsense. I could use a bit of the black myself, with a shot of rum, of course. Andre, why don't you be a good servant and go get us the coffee? Your wish is my command, for no more than one month. Six. ANDRE: Six? Yes. ANDRE: Six. I've been thinking, Brittney and Gregory. About what, Dominique? Oh, please call me miss. Sounds so much better. I don't understand. I thought we were becoming friends. Actually, Andre just wanted you over so that he could sleep with Brittney. Why would he think that I would do that? It was a bet that we had. ANDRE: Here we are. And he just lost. What bet what was that? Which one of us could screw the two of you first. ANDRE: And I guess the game has ended. And I've won. Right, Gregory? You had sex with Dominique? If it makes you feel any better, honey, I had to bribe him with $200,000. Bribed him? You bribed him? That's cheating. We never made rules on how to get them. We just had to get them. Money. I should've gone that angle. What? I still wouldn't have done it. Well, Gregory wasn't so solid. He fell like a house of cards. ANDRE: Now I have to pick up the pieces, thank you very much. I knew you wouldn't pay the money. Actually, I owe you $5 million, not $200,000. ANDRE: $5 million? How so? My asshole dead husband. He left it to them. I fought it for two years in probate, but I had to sign yesterday. Then why all this? Why the game? You took $5 million from me. I wanted your marriage. Oh, my. I guess you do win, Dominique. Mm, yes. What is so goddamn funny? I just fucked your husband. Yes. Very good job, Gregory. Well, thank you, my dear wife. I thought it was icing on the cake. BRITTNEY: Oh, I'm sorry, miss, but we knew about the $5 million. What do you mean? When we met, we knew that Bill was a sucker for a love story. We worked him. But Bill insisted that we had to be married to get it. We got married, talked about love every damn day. We worked it. BRITTNEY: He dies and leaves us $5 million. GREGORY: You think these things remained secret? Your lawyer called us before the coffin was even closed. So we kept the charade up till you finally gave in. We never even lived together. We had sex now and then to make it look good. Yeah. $5 million is a lot of screw about. Now we can get a divorce and be done with it. Hey, I screwed you twice today. Oh, and thanks for firing us. Now we can collect unemployment, too. Oh, Andre? I was going to do you, but it looks like I don't need to after all. Well, so much for educating Brittney. Damn. They were good. Yeah. He's more ruthless than you. We should have them over for dinner sometime. I think it's time that you start repaying your wager. You think you won. And what makes you think I didn't let you win? Somehow I think it doesn't matter. Six months? I'm going to hold you in my debt. [MUSIC PLAYING]
