I'm nervous. It's silly, I've done this so many times I don't even think about it anymore, I just sit down and start talking but this time it's different. People have this idea about me that nothing ever fazes me, they never see me lose my cool. Doesn't mean I never do. There's so much beneath the surface. I've set up a study that captures the people around me as they really are: the good, the bad. You can really never love someone until you've seen both sides. I saw both sides of her and now I must say goodbye. Goodbye. It just, it all started when I heard about this club. CFB. Heard a couple guys on the team talking about it and when I asked what it was they wouldn't tell me. They said I had to see for myself. I talked to Major Daniels to see if he can get permission to bring me to a rally. Duty calls. Rallies. Like in some legitimate cause and not an excuse to act like fucking animals. Is this recording? What do we have here? Well, I like what you've done with the place. Do they sell these at Ikea? I shouldn't be here. I'll do it. I'll do it for you, Amelia. I haven't slept in days. Not since I found her body. Here I am. Now what are you gonna do with me? You mentioned blackmail in your text of video footage Amelia has of me. I guess I shouldn't give you anything more than you already have, though. Or claim to have. Don't get me wrong, I'm no angel, but I don't believe for a second that Amelia possessed compromising footage of me. I don't know what you're talking about. I'm not even interesting enough to blackmail. Wait, why should I trust anything you say? Is this really necessary? Yes, this is what I do, Garrett. But he'll know. Fuck. Okay. I believe you. If you think I had anything to do with Amelia, I didn't. You think I killed her in a jealous rage or something? Carrie, on the other hand. You know what I first thought when I got your text? That you were Amelia. That girl is a breakdown waiting to happen. I know that's not possible. Amelia's dead. I don't doubt it. One day she's this polished princess. I found her body. I touched her skin when I felt for her pulse. The next she's gotten all dark and brooding and on this path of destruction. She hadn't been dead long but she was already cool. She was already gone. Welcome to the one in five club, sweetie. So what? You want me to cop some responsibility for Zach's untimely death? You wanna really know why Zach is dead? You're asking the wrong person. I was his girlfriend. Not that that means anything. You think this is gonna help me? No, you're only gonna make things worse. Not everyone's like you, not everyone gets to be themselves. Okay? Not without consequences. Sometimes it's better to just live a lie. Safer. Oh, who am I kidding? I can't even admit the truth to myself. People keep waiting for me to break down. It's okay to cry, Garrett. Like I'd cry over that asshole who broke my nose! Amelia introduced us, Zach and I. He told me once that he knew Amelia was gonna do great things. I said to him, "Zach, you could be in the next Summer Olympics." I was his best friend. But for the past week I wanted to kill him. He just shrugged. "Maybe." Something was off. Then right before Halloween he just-- He drank too much, disappeared at night. Stopped caring. Kept secrets, even from me. This was Zach's favorite whiskey. Drank a whole bottle of it the night he died. There wasn't just alcohol in his system. This part wasn't made public. Zach's parents musta made some kinda deal with the cops. Zach's family was that kinda rich. It wasn't just booze, there were also drugs. Oxycontin. I didn't even know Zach was into that shit! Not that it wasn't easy enough to come by. Raquel Keena could get you anything you needed. I heard she'd even sell roofies for the right price. She should be the one who's sitting here, not me. Well, this is one occasion when I can honestly say I'm as innocent as a lamb. You know what happened to her. Amelia didn't take first place at the stupid local film festival so she went home and she took a bunch of Oxy like the stupid bitch she turned out to be! I bet Carrie, my sis, well, my step-sister, but she always calls herself my sister, I bet she got the same text. I barely even knew Amelia. I never even met Zach Turner. So, it's not like I have anything to confess. Someone might see me. One of them, and it's not, it's not safe for me here. It was so much easier before people noticed me, you know? I could just go back to class and sit alone in my own little world. It was my safe place. I didn't have to talk to anyone, I could just, I could just be isolated. Not lonely, just alone. Then I met Amelia. Everything changed. I'm sorry for calling you a bitch, Amelia. She showed me I could be different. A better me. You know I don't like calling other girls that name. Even your ex, and she's one crazy bitch. I used to be such a nice girl. She's been different since she met Amelia. That's who I was when you first met me. I don't know why I'm still talking like it's you behind these cameras. And she stopped being interested in anyone who wasn't Amelia, even me. Whenever I think of cameras, I think of you. The little window you used to view the world, to capture it, to capture me. When you first started filming me, you asked me what the worst thing I'd ever done was. I wanted to impress you. But the only thing I could think of was drawing on my bedroom walls with a permanent marker when I was six-years-old. And Carrie and I used to look out for each other. She was my best friend, I thought I was hers, too. And then we just, we just painted over it like it never happened. I can't go back to the person I was. I can't paint over the person I am now. I haven't felt safe since that night. I needed you, Amelia. I needed you and you left me. And I'm never gonna forgive you for it. If you're watching this and I'm not sitting beside you, then as they say, I'm probably dead and you're the reason why. I've always wanted to say that. Kinda funny when you think about it. I never thought I'd be reciting such a tired line about my own life. I never thought I'd mean it. Honestly, there are a few things I'd like to get off my chest, especially in regards to Miss Amelia Lincoln. I'm in trouble. Maybe if she was able to confess that she was obsessed with me, basically started stalking me. She might be alive today. And I'm not alone. I started CFB because I am tired of the way the world has turned on our gender for simply behaving to our biological imperative. I've dragged people into this with me and if you're one of those people, then I'm sorry. When I started the CFB project I had no idea where it would go. I suppose it is possible that someone made it into a CFB rally with their cell phone or some secret little spy camera or whatever. I kept following even when I knew I should stop. Even when I knew that there'd be consequences for telling the truth. And I had no idea that my movement would cause so much momentum. So I'm recording this now before it's too late. I'm an upstanding citizen. I know too much. Amelia tried her damnedest to prove otherwise. I have video proof of what they've been doing and I'm going to show everyone. And that didn't work out too well for her. I'm going to take them down. And it won't for you either. Whether or not they take me down first. Forgive me, father, for I have sinned. It has been several lifetimes of debauchery since my last confession. Maybe that's when I started to lose myself, you know? I mean, maybe that's why I'm so confused now. Don't worry. I won't light it. My mind used to be so quiet and now I'm just, I'm so so full. Although, this. This would make the perfect hot box. Both thoughts, thoughts that I have never had before and ideas that just seem to come out of nowhere. I mean, once you start to change, can you ever go back? I mean, can you ever be silent again? I can't. Okay, I know things now. I have seen things that I should not have seen and if they find out, if they. If they find out they're gonna try and keep me quiet and I used to be good at that, you know? I used to be good at silence but not anymore. Okay. So, as you know. I dabble in the procurement and distribution of illegal substances, nothing serious, just what every normal college student needs. Weed, Adderall, a little Oxy, and that new stuff. Oddson. God, what a great name for a drug. But I didn't sell to Amelia. Even, even if she had wanted to buy from me, I wouldn't have sold to her. First, out of loyalty to you-know-who, and second, I don't sell to first-time users. Way too easy for the inexperienced to OD on that shit. I don't want that on my hands. She had to get it from somewhere. What I'm saying is, I sold it to someone who sold it to Amelia. I think I know who it was. I think you do, too. You don't miss a thing. Had to be him, right? You know, I don't understand why weed is still considered a drug. Respectable states sell it out of vending machines these days. We'll be soon together, love. But I have a voice now. I have things that I need to say about Amelia and about Zach, about why they're gone. It didn't have to be this way. You know the floor's wet? Did someone decide to take a wee in here? Fuck. What did you do? God damn you, what did you do! I'm talking to you because I think you know. There. No one will look in Cognitive Dissonance. You know who killed her. I don't wanna know who's blood that is. Someone like Amelia. I mean, she wouldn't take her own life, she, she. She was life. I had the wrong idea about this. I thought this was some kind of tribute. No, no, no. Someone's responsible, not her. And I need to hear it out loud. Someone like Amelia? I know I'm not what most people call a good person. I'm only able to afford tuition here by grace of my criminal enterprises. Not that I, that I think of myself as a drug dealer. More of a really well paid intern. I don't wanna hurt anyone. As brilliant. As beautiful as Amelia. Someone was so so threatened by that that they had to destroy her. I'll do one of these over your cold dead body. Are you getting off on this? On watching me suffer? What is wrong with you? What does that have anything to do with how he died? Okay, okay. Why did you come here, June? Do you know? Know what? Yeah, well, we were too young for real commitment, anyway. Where Zach is right now. If he would've talked to me about it I would've agreed that we could sleep with other people. Why would I know that? Because everybody tells you their secrets. I'm not lying. That's because I keep them. You have your confession. I'm gone. Why did you come here? You knew I wouldn't tell you anything Zach confessed to me. Why are you letting me film you? Is there something you want to confess? Is there something you want to confess? Is there something you want to confess? Confess, confess. - Okay, okay! Shut up, stop, okay! I'll tell you the truth. I'll tell you what I told Amelia that night. Okay! Okay! Okay. Okay. Uh. When I first met Amelia I was intrigued. Are you going to say anything? We went out for a bit. I told you that, remember? This is a waste of time. But she likes girls who like only girls, and you know me. Well, I like whatever the fuck I like. The way she watched people always, always filming. You shouldn't trust her, Raquel. But you will. I don't like anyone looking at me that closely. And I know why. Except maybe you. I need to sleep. I'm losing it. I could ask Raquel for some sleeping pills, Ambien, or something to help me relax. Vicodin. Oh, I guess that's for pain, but so is Oxy. Why did Amelia have it? I mean, she must've gotten it from Raquel. But she wasn't in pain, she wasn't disturbed. She was the most mentally healthy person that I knew. There was this thing about her, a shine. People were drawn to her. They told her things that they hadn't told anybody. How did you get access to Amelia's footage? If you really do have Amelia's archives, then you've seen the footage she took of me from that night. My confession to her about what happened to me at Zach Turner's party. I can't do this! I can't talk to you! I don't know who you are or what you are. I'm gonna pretend you're her. Amelia. You were the only person that I told about what happened to me that night. And now no one knows. And I feel so fucking alone. I bet I could stand in the middle of a crowd and scream at the top of my lungs and no one would hear me. Maybe I'm more like your ex than I want to admit. And all anyone's gonna remember is that I beat her for some silly award. She wanted it so badly. Maybe I only wanted it because she did. I mean, it mattered to her, so it mattered to me, but before that. I mean, before that we were so much more than competitors, but she was my mentor. I've been seeing her a lot lately since you've died. She was my friend. She's everywhere. When I had a secret crush on Major, she was the one who encouraged me to tell him. I think she's been watching me. I know somebody has been watching me at night. And following me. I shouldn't of said that. Gosh, gosh. Time flies when you're really gettin' your confession on, huh? Now, look, I don't want you to get the wrong idea, I love women, especially the sluts at this school. And don't get up in arms of my use of the word slut, all right? I'm not shaming, I'm applauding. I mean, you gotta love these sparkling new adults, huh? The more they fuck the more progressive they think they are. The more they tell themselves they like giving blow jobs, the more legit their claim to feminism. You know, they're taking the power back, huh? They are women, hear them suck my cock. Personally, though, I never go down on these women. Don't judge. Oral sex is a lotta work and I'm a busy man. But you won't tell anybody that I'm too lazy to make these women cum, will you? I mean, this is all confidential, right? There is something I've needed to say. Not to you, just out loud to anyone. I guess you could call it a confession. I do wonder, though, if any of my boys have been through here. Hm? I saw Garrett leave this building on my way in. The morning she died I told Amelia everything I know about CFB. He had better of watched what he said before he opened his mouth about CFB. Do you know what CFB stands for? Cock Fights Back. I happen to have footage of Garrett and his dead friend's girl that could make him look very very bad. Now, why the hell would I join a group called Cock Fights Back? I guess, when I first heard it I thought the name was funny, kind of like Pussy Grabs Back. But once you're in it's like the mafia. Amelia isn't the only one on campus with a collection of damning video. I wanted her to expose Major. I won't show anyone without your permission. This is for you. Think of it as therapy. I don't need therapy. Everyone needs therapy. Especially men. You think you're not allowed to have feelings. But if you have Amelia's footage you already know what I said. Major uses it, you know. All the anger you don't know how to express, he points you at a willing target, a human punching bag, and gives you permission to unleash. He knows just how to use you. You know the worst thing I've ever done. I liked it. I liked having permission to do something awful. I know. I've made up my mind. I'm gonna tell Major I want out. And I'm gonna tell anyone who listens the truth about CFB. Getting hot in here. Maybe instead of installing all these cameras, you could've had some AC. You wouldn't mind me stepping outside for a few minutes, would you? Just long enough for a quick smoke. I know, it's a nasty habit and it'll kill me. Blah, blah, blah. I mean, that's why I went to Major's Cock Fights Back rallies. But there are times when you know something is bad for you and you do it anyway because it's exciting. No love. Not even hate. You have to get that. It's just silent. I know you don't wanna admit it, but in many ways Amelia was bad for you. She didn't love you enough and you always knew it. It made you paranoid. I'm feeling a little paranoid myself lately! Here's something I may have conveniently forgotten to mention. One of my products went missing not too long ago. A few days before Zach and Amelia died, actually. I decided to have a little fire sale, everything must go, even my stash of Oddson. So now I'm outta the game. Maybe for good. I was thinking I would try out the straight and narrow. Be nice to feel free for a little while, you know? Not have to look over my shoulder. Get so stoned and knock myself out at night. See, if I let myself think about all the ways my life could fall apart in any second I'd be dumb. Are you really going to do this? Jesus Christ! Yes, I have to. Why? You know why. Because of what he did to me. It's too dangerous. You'll get hurt. I'll be fine. I got some Oddson. From Raquel? No. Someone else. Is you taking amphetamines before going to Major's hellhole supposed to make me feel better? This is not about you. Not everything is. Look, I shouldn't of left you there that night and I'm sorry, but I don't think that Zach did this to you. Then who did? Okay. Okay! I get it now. You have to know that the way Zach died is bullshit. Did you see him in the water? He was like fucking Poseidon. He couldn't of drowned no matter how much he had to drink. I don't care what anybody says. He had been drinking too much lately. Not just at night, during the day sometimes, too. Right when he got out of bed. Now here's a confession. Cock Fights Back, it's a fight club. But instead of men fighting men, we're supposed to fight a girl. It got even worse when he saw me at the CFB rally with Garrett. Not against her will. There were always volunteers. I wanted to hit somebody to unleash. There are a lotta man haters out there nowadays. A lotta girls who hate one man in particular. I wanted to be the one to put Garrett in his place. So I got matched up against June. She chose me. I don't know what I was thinking. But I swear I didn't know it was her. Guys that participate have to wear a blindfold. It's Major's idea of a joke. The strongest woman can't even beat a man while he's blindfolded. I just wanted to feel powerful. But June, she kicked me in the nuts as soon as the bell sounded. Like I could do anything. And she tripped me, but I took her to the ground with me. Got on top of her, held her down, that's when Zach showed up and saw who I was fighting. Zach never told me he was part of CFB. Pulled me off of her and he just started wailing on me. Seriously thought he was gonna kill me. But that wasn't what I confessed to Amelia. How many of us went to her with our most shameful secrets? Letting her film us, answering the one question she asked everyone: "What's the worst thing you've ever done?" You know what, I don't need to relive that thing with Garrett. I've said enough. Stop it. If you think it's so important, then go ask Garrett. Why do you wanna know why June hates me? What does it matter? But I've never been more ashamed of myself than I was that day. I feel like this isn't even my confession to make. If I hadn't gone to Garrett's that day it would all be different. Last week June showed up at the house I rent with Zach but she said she needed to talk to me. She just took her clothes off. At first I was too surprised to react. Even when she sat on my lap and started kissing me. But right away, I knew what she wanted. But I was just so mad. She found out Zach was cheating on her and tried to get back at him in the meanest way she could think of. I'll admit. I've always had a thing for June, but she didn't want me. She wanted to hurt Zach. So I pushed her off of me, told her to put her clothes on and get the hell out. She refused to leave. Demanded that I tell her who Zach was seeing behind her back. I told her I didn't know but she didn't believe me. I just wanted her to stop so I pushed her out the door a little too hard. She was still naked so I tossed her her clothes. She wasn't hurt or anything, but. Humiliated, rejected by everybody. She told me to watch my back and then she left. I wish that I could take it all back. I wanna be different, I wanna be better. So that's it? I can go, just like that? Thank you. I thought Zach deserved to know what his girl had done, so when he got home, I told him the whole story. He didn't react like I expected. I thought he would be pissed, maybe at both of us, but he didn't seem angry. He just seemed scared. Not of June or me, just there was something else going on. I don't know what else I can tell you! I think I know who it was who stole from me. Carrie started to change the moment she met Amelia. Had to be him, right? I didn't worry about her until after that swimmer guy's Halloween party. Carrie didn't have the guts to come to me herself, she sent her lackey instead. I shoulda been there to look out for her, I know what a lightweight she is. He came to my apartment to get her Oddson. And I woulda kept an eye on her, made sure she didn't have more than a couple drinks. You called me. Made sure an arrogant jock like Zach was never alone with her. And I went out on the balcony to take your call. You can't trust guys like that! They think they're entitled to whatever they want. I left him alone just for a few minutes. Amelia was always dragging her places she shouldn't go. Exposing her to people who could get her into trouble. I know because I followed her. He's such a passive little dork I didn't see he was a threat. Carrie invited me to go with them to his party. But I said no. Still. Later that night Carrie called me so drunk she could barely talk. She couldn't find Amelia, didn't know how to get home. And I went to find her but I, she was already gone. Still, it doesn't make sense. I still don't know what happened that night. Carrie won't even talk to me anymore. Even if he stole the Oxy, why would he give it to Amelia? This is why I wish she'd never met Amelia. Or Zach. Fuck that guy. Both. I miss the old Carrie. I want her back the way she was. The way she is now, I, I can't protect her from all the shitty people at this school. I can't protect her from herself. People say that when you die you only regret the things you didn't do. It does feel like a confessional, it really, like if I tell you all the things that I feel guilty about that you, I'll be forgiven. I don't buy it. One time I walked in on her after she got outta the shower. Saw her naked. I regret going to Zach's party. I regret letting him buy me a drink. I've felt bad about that for awhile, so. Yeah, I saw my step sister's body and it was probably the hottest thing I've ever seen. Better than any porn, and I've seen plenty of porn. I regret falling for her. I'm not into Carrie that way. Yeah, yeah. I'm attracted to her, but I would never. I would never do anything about it. You're the one behind this? Me? No. Then why are you here? I got a text. I'm guessing you did, too. Did you confess? Yeah. Said everything I could think to say. Me, too. I was here earlier. Whoever made this said I could go. I thought it was over. Then why'd you come back? I got a text. It said I wasn't done. What did you do, Zach? Just tell me. No one else ever has to know. But I think that they should and I think you should tell the truth. - You don't get it! If anyone gets it, it's me. No, you're an artist. You've always been an artist. People expect you to be different, okay? It's not the same for athletes. You're a swimmer, not a football player. It doesn't matter. I have a girlfriend. I have friends! They have friends who will think they never knew me. And me keeping this part of myself is some sort of betrayal. I'm not like you. I'm not. Okay, I can't just accept myself. I don't even know who the hell I am anymore. I'm not as all together as everyone thinks I am. I'm still learning about myself. It's why I do this. Underneath it all, I'm just as screwed up as everyone else. There's too many eyes on me. My parents, the coaches, the fucking scouts. They all need me to be what they need me to be but nobody's ever asked me what Zach wants. And what do you need, Zach? I didn't know it still. Some people say that they, they always knew they felt different. Not me. Felt weird. It's weird how easy it is to just lie to yourself about something so, so basic. I never knew what I wanted until him. Did you know? No. Then it wasn't our fault. It had nothing to do with us. Don't kid yourself! We were his friends. We were supposed to be the people he could trust. Hey. Now we know better. We can be better. I already broke my promise. I promised myself in honor of Amelia that I wouldn't lie and I did. Amelia never lied. She was brutal that way. But you knew you knew you could trust her. I did, I trusted her, I trusted her, and she trusted me. But I ruined everything! I didn't mean to. I just wanted one more thing from her. Okay. In honor of Amelia, I'll tell you the truth about Major. To commemorate this. You know why I came here even though I never did one of Amelia's confessions sessions? Bet you do. Anyway, Amelia invited me to do one, and I kinda wish I'd done it. I think you've been the one that's following me. I guess anyone can do it. I could just. Pull up my phone, confess to it just to see how the words sound. Then delete. See, I've been trying to figure out who you might be. You know, my first guess was Major. I could see him staging something like this to find out what we all know about him. But that doesn't feel right. And then I considered June or Garrett. Yeah, but, they're only interested in Zach. I think I need to rewind. And they're not this creative. Can I rewind? Well, not creative as much as derivative. No. No, I can't. I'm sure you already know this, but Amelia filmed everything. I get confused sometimes. My mind just fills up and up and up and up up and. Then it goes clear. Including her own daily personal confessions. She did every night before she went to sleep. You know, I think that's what I loved most about Amelia. Oh, when I was with her it was like everything was just like. She had been doing it for years. She wanted to edit them all together one day and make this like narrative of her life. And now everything is loud. I thought it was genius. Like a storm. I bet you do, too. The truth is Amelia didn't tell me to talk to Major. She told me not to talk to him and I did it anyway. I can't even remember why I did. That's not true. Yes, I can. I mean, I'm lying again, why? Why am I lying? You promised yourself you wouldn't lie. I'll tell you something I could never lie about. I idolized Amelia, she was everything that I wanted to be. She had a voice. She had something to say and I wanted to be just like her. I mean, I still do. When I met her I didn't have anything to say. Now I do. Thanks to Amelia I found my voice. You asked me for here for a reason. So, you said it had nothing to do with nocturnal activities, so go ahead. Ask me anything you want. And with my newfound voice I called up Major. Have you been getting any calls by somebody with the name Noelle? No. Then he said, "Who the fuck is this?" Are you sure? I said Noelle. I don't know anybody named Noelle. And he said, "Who the fuck is Noelle?" Why are you lying? What did she say to you? What did she say? She knows, doesn't she? And I said, "Someday you'll know." Not about the rallies, about Zach. Now, look, I'm not trying to justify bad behavior, I truly believe that my way is the normal way. And all these other people trying to be politically correct and moral and good, they're just exhausting. Not me. Oh no, I feel fucking good. I feel fucking great, actually. Don't be so hard on yourselves, ladies. It's not psychological, it's biological. Why don't you just stop with the campaigns and the t-shirts declaring your gender's independence and stop posting about the sexual harassment in the workplace. You know that if we stopped harassing you you'd only feel neglected. And for god sakes stop running for-- Hi. I forgot what I was saying. Oh. Yes. What the fuck? Wanna kiss? Maybe. Well, I watched Amelia's videos. Something more satisfying? You offering? Read my lips. What's the catch? So many secrets. And she, she kept them well. You don't trust me? Not with my dick. Something else then? Aw, you gonna make me beg? More. Are you the one that told me to come here? But sometimes secrets aren't meant to be kept. I was told to come here and make you feel good. Is it working? You're on the right track. So when I said that I had a crush on Major. What I meant was. I was going to crush Major. I had never been in love before. I always knew I was into girls but no one in particular. Until her. Barely ever said a word in the class we had together. Experimental Film and Digital Media. Hardly gave anything other than one word answers. Yes, no. So that's what I called her. No. - No. She liked that. She never had a nickname. No one had ever known her well enough to give her one. I definitely didn't expect to fall in love with her. I certainly didn't expect her to love me back. I told her about my confessional project. I wanted to put a confessional booth up somewhere on campus and let people record whatever they wanted. I've been doing that for awhile now. I always wanted to look into my own eyes while I filmed so that I couldn't lie to myself. You can always tell if somebody is lying through their eyes. Especially when they're on camera. I wanted No to be the first one I filmed for my digital media series confessional. No said no. Big surprise. And now I know why. She was afraid that I would see her truth because her truth is emptiness. I caught her going through my confessional archives and she began to mimic me. The way I speak, the way I think. She wanted to replace me. That's why she watched my confessions. To absorb as much of me as possible. She's watched almost every video, but not this one. She can never know that I'm st-- I've been so stupid. I should've known exactly who you were when you texted me. How long have you been planning this? Since Amelia dumped you? That's right, Noelle. I know exactly who you are. I replaced you. And you hate me for it, don't you? We had some good times together, didn't we? I helped you when you were heartbroken, remember? She told me about you. When you came to me you were suicidal. You wanted Oxy but I refused to sell it to you. I knew what you planned to do with it. She never could've really loved you, you know? 'Cause there never was a you. And then we shroomed together. Your mind opened up. You realized there's life beyond Amelia. You don't need her! You just attached yourself to her because she was so alive. You fed off of her like a parasite. You would've consumed her if she would've let you. But you got what you wanted in the end. She had to pull her festival submission at last second because you beat her to it. I thought that she should've shown them anyway and turned you in for plagiarism. I never got a chance to ask her why she didn't. I thought it was because she was afraid of you. Now I think it's because she felt sorry for you. She thought you were pathetic. Why are you doing this to me? Am I your new Amelia? No. I'm not special enough for you, I know that. Even Amelia wasn't special enough. That's why she dumped you. 'Cause she was threatened by you. She thought she was such a revolutionary with her investigation into Major and his secret society of misogynists. Like, what's so secret about the fact that men think they're superior to women? Big revelation, Amelia. Thank you so much for clearing that up for us. You're the one with the real talent. You're just getting starting. I can't wait to see what you do with this. Carrie? Why are you here? I got a text saying if I didn't. Saying you needed me so I came right away. Carrie. Carrie, I know everything about Amelia, about the fights you go to at night. You gotta stop before you get hurt. I'm already hurt. I'd rather have broken bones and bruises than what's inside of me now. Okay. I've been holding something back. But before I say it I want to remind you that I am not your enemy. I told you about Oddson. If you ask me I don't even know why it's illegal. Oddson are like, like a souped up caffeine pill. You take it and for a few hours you feel superhuman. You're stronger, faster, you feel no pain. It's particularly effective for fighting. Oh, even better for fucking. That's why I gave it to Sai. Something happened to me before Amelia died. Before we were even close. We don't, we don't have to talk about it, we don't. I mean, I'm here for you, but if you don't wanna tell me, that's okay. - No. No, I want to, I think I should. You're my best friend. Sai, I'm sorry that I wasn't there for you when you came to school. I have been a shitty friend and a shitty sister. I understand why you didn't come to Zach's party with me. But I wish you had. I needed my brother. Help me understand, Noelle. Why did Sai buy Oddson? Why did he steal the Oxy? What did he use it for? I wasn't planning to drink that night. I even drove there so I'd have an excuse not to. Amelia and I got separated and I was gonna leave but then Zach Turner came up to me. He offered me a drink. He was nice. And not at all what I expected him to be being the big deal he is. So I accepted the drink. And you know me with hard liquor. By the fourth drink I felt dizzy. I might've drank more after that but I don't remember. The next morning I woke up in my own bed. He was rough. I know there's pain at first but it's like he wanted to hurt me. Oddson. He used it with her. That fucking piece of shit. Amelia sensed something was wrong but I didn't tell her right away. I asked her how I'd gotten home, she said she didn't know. She tried to find me but I was gone. And then I asked if she'd seen Zach, but she hadn't. So, it was him. I mean, that's all guys like that do. Well, kinda what happens to drunk girls who cry rape against superstar athletes. And then Amelia told me about Cock Fights Back club. I had to fight him. I didn't think I'd hurt him. I just wanted to try. Just a little. But then before Amelia died she said she was sure it wasn't him. I stole from you, Raquel. It was him, Carrie. Or I stole from someone who stole from you. That's the only thing that makes sense. I had my eye on him. If he were here now, if he were alive, I would make sure he paid for what he did. But if Amelia was right then Zach was innocent. Innocent guys don't need to drink whole bottles of whiskey mixed with Oxycontin! I knew, I knew that he was up to no good. What you need to do now is move forward, Carrie. I bet he's wondering what happened to the rest of the Oxy. I will be here for you every step of the way. What did you say about Oxycontin? He didn't use it all on Zach. Nothing. Just enough to get the job done. No, you did. You said. Innocent guys don't need to drink whole bottles of whiskey mixed with Oxycontin! I'm not obsessed with her, I just saw her naked. Better than any porn. Carrie called me so drunk, I went to find her but I followed her. I'm not, I'm not obsessed with her. I called you? You said you didn't pick me up. You picked me up and helped me into my apartment? Was I even conscious when you did it? You don't understand. You were all over me. You were hanging on me. Is that what you told yourself? That I got drunk enough to wanna screw my step brother? Did I even fight you when you climbed on top of me? Is that why I had bruises? Why, why would you wanna hurt me? I thought you wanted to do it and. And then it went too far and I couldn't stop. You don't understand, Carrie! You're the only girl who was ever nice to me and then we came here and it was like I didn't matter anymore. Like I was nothing! I'm not a girl, Sai. I'm your sister. Carrie, I can make this right. I can make it right! Please, that's what that's, that's what this is about! I can confess and you can forgive me. I will never forgive you. How did you get Zach to take Oxy before swimming? Did you kill him so I couldn't confront him? No, no. No, Major told me to. He saw me leaving Zach's party with you and he woulda told you if I didn't do what he said. Why, why would Major wanna kill Zach? He didn't, he didn't! It was just supposed to be a warning and I didn't know what the pills were. Not until it was already done. I didn't know! I swear I'm not lying. I'm not lying, I swear! I didn't know! Stop, I'm not lying! I didn't. Hit me. Hit me like the guys you hit at CFB. That's why you go, right? Then you'll be able to forgive me. Carrie. You. Yeah? Should probably leave first. Really? What? - I thought-- - You shouldn't have. So what next, Noelle? What else do you want me to say? You don't have to say anything. I haven't tell you about Major's confession yet. This is unexpected. Hello, Major. Who the hell are you? Hello, Major, Major, Major, Major, Major Major, Major - Who the hell are you? Come here and let me out - Major, Major, Major. - Of this fucking thing! - Major, Major, Major, Major, Major, Major, Major, Major. Better not move or you'll rip it off. What did you do to me? I set a trap and you fell in dick first. What did you put on me? Oh, the cage? Uh, it's an interesting device I found on the internet. It'll keep you behaving yourself until I'm done with you. Fucking cunt. Be careful with what you say, Major. I am pretty sensitive right now. It's day two of my period, I'm kind of emotional. Fuck you. I don't think you would fuck me even if I had the most inviting pussy on the planet. See, I know what you crave. I know all your secrets. And who are you? I'm an artist like Amelia. But more evolved. You see, she thought film was her medium, but that's just how she captured the real art. People are my art. And I've been learning how to use interesting people like you how to manipulate. Manipulate my medium. This booth is my canvas. You, the others; June, Garrett, Sai, Carrie, Raquel, Amelia and Zach. You're all my paint. Okay, you're an artist, I'm your paint. What do you plan on painting with me? The truth. The truth will set you free. And don't you wanna be free, Major? Are we really doing this? Why not? And we both want to and you know I won't tell anyone. And I know you won't either. Wait, wait. Can we just, I don't know, talk for a minute? After. I need this first. I mean, I might lose my nerve. Yeah. Yeah, okay. Where did you get the Zach video? - Not important. - Where the fuck did you get it? If you must know, I got it off of Amelia's computer. How did she know? Oh, how did she know? That while you present yourself as a messiah of misogyny you were secretly getting your dick sucked by every willing male on campus. Especially the supposedly straight ones. Oh! And then filming them to make sure that they would keep your secret. Zach was in love with you. You know that, right? Or maybe he was obsessed. I mean, you were his first foray into being who he really is. And that was meaningful to him. I'm not gay. Oh no, no, no. I don't think that. And you're not bisexual either. You're dominant. That's it. If being dominant was a sexual orientation, that is what you would be. Although you do have a taste for the alpha males. Yeah. They're more of a challenge. It's more satisfying. To get them on their knees to the point where they submit. Zach was different, though. He wanted more from you. And he saw something in you worth loving. You broke his heart when you threatened him with that video. Are you even capable of loving anyone? I wasn't. And then I was. And now she's gone. So are you going to let me go now? Not until you confess. Confess to what? You already know everything! Yes! Yes, I do! I know everything, everything! But I need, I need to hear you say it. Say what? That you killed Zach! What? No, he drowned. It was an accident. All right. All right, Major. Well, you made your choice. Wait, aren't you going to let me go? You never confessed and you knew the rules. It's the same as the others: truth or consequences. You chose consequences. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no! Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait! Come back, come back. I'll tell you anything. I'll confess it all! Major. Like I said, he chose consequences. Can you tell me where you are right now? Close enough. Tell me where, I'll come to you. No, I want you to listen. Noelle, I'll listen better in person when I know you're safe. I am not gonna hurt myself. You don't have to worry. Don't you understand? I'm doing all of this so that I can be free. Truth and consequences, I am ready to face them, whatever they are. Garrett, June, Major, Sai, even Carrie. I invited them all here so they could confess their truth and they could hear the confessions of others but do you know why I invited you here, Raquel? Where are you? I invited you here to hear my confession. I could never stop loving Amelia. She made me come alive. She saw something in me that no one else did. Shouldn't you be the one in this seat, Noelle? You first. You said that if I let you come over that you would confess to everything on camera. That you would confess to stealing my ideas. It's the only reason why I left my door open to you. Here. It's for you. I made it just how you like it: hazelnut creamer. You forgot the three and a half sugars. Did I? No. You didn't. You never do. Think she saw herself in me. Stop with the games and just tell me what I need to hear and leave! I'm gonna give you what you want Amelia, I'm gonna confess everything that I did to you. And more. I mean, I'm gonna tell you about stuff that you don't even know about. Every secret, every betrayal, every lie. But you have to do something for me first. But I. I took it too far. You have to admit you're still in love with me. Noelle, you can't be. I am, though. And I want you to say it. And I want you to mean it. And I always do. No. I can't. I don't. That's what I thought you'd say. You know, I wish I was wrong, but I know you, Amelia, and you never lie. And I wanna be like you. I do, I wanna tell the truth. You're starting to feel it now, aren't you? What? It's a good thing you like so much sugar in your coffee, otherwise you might've detected the flavor. They're bitter. You prefer sweet. I'm glad that you didn't lie, Amelia. That would've been beneath you. But now you know. And you know the worst thing that I ever did I. I killed you. So I could become you. So that you'd always be inside me and we could be together. And that's what I came here to confess. I came here to confess it to you. That the worst thing I ever did was I killed the only person who I could ever love. Why are you smiling? Do you want to hear my last confession? I always tell the truth. Yes, you do. You do. You, you, you never lie. I never lie. Except to the one person that I could ever love. I just wanted to hear her say it one more time. That. That she loved me. Then I could let her go. Then we could be free. Now you know the truth. Now you know me as well as I knew Amelia. She's a part of me. And now I'm a part of you. You gonna turn Sai in? I've done my part. The rest is up to Carrie. He's toast. What about Major, is he gonna be? Well, some things can be reattached but only if they're in your possession. Worried I'm gonna turn you in? You wouldn't. You don't know me. Yes, I do. So no one's gonna know the truth about all this. Truth or consequences. I mean, that's the choice that I gave you. But here's the thing. There is no truth without consequences. Does that mean you're gonna turn yourself in? Now wouldn't that be a boring and unworthy end to our story? What are you gonna do then? How are you gonna face your consequences? What are you gonna do with our confessions? ♪ You tell me to look at the night sky ♪ ♪ I prefer to look at the bright side ♪ ♪ In the darkness no rules to abide ♪ ♪ Strong like music ♪ ♪ Tough like rawhide ♪ ♪ You tell me to look at the night sky ♪ ♪ I prefer to look at the bright side ♪ ♪ In the darkness no rules to abide ♪ ♪ Strong like music ♪ ♪ Tough like rawhide ♪ ♪ You tell me to look at the bright side ♪ ♪ I prefer to look at the night sky ♪ ♪ In the darkness no rules to abide ♪ ♪ Strong like music ♪ ♪ Tough like rawhide ♪ ♪ You tell me to look at the bright side ♪ ♪ I prefer to look at the night sky ♪ ♪ In the darkness no rules to abide ♪ ♪ Strong like music ♪ ♪ Tough like rawhide ♪ ♪ Strong like music ♪ ♪ Tough like rawhide ♪ ♪ Strong like music ♪ ♪ Tough like rawhide ♪ ♪ You tell me to look at the night sky ♪ ♪ I prefer to look at the bright side ♪ ♪ In the darkness no rules to abide ♪ ♪ Strong like music ♪ ♪ Tough like rawhide ♪
