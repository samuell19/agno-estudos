Where are you going? We don't know yet. The rain is late. Worse than this, is Manelao's gang. - Umm, Manelao... - Don't laugh, sir! Thanks, but I have to go. - Farewell. - Good-bye, sir. Let's bargain. What I get back? - Bainha doesn't have a defect, right? - The defect he has is in sight. Good afternoon! Good afternoon! How worldy! I want to talk to you, sir. Good afternoon, Mr. Risonho. Good afternoon, ma'am. Good afternoon, Ms. Rosa. - The man has arrived. - So, let's go. Lazy man! Zeca, let's get out of here. Risonho is a friend of Manelao's. I think that Manelao is no friend to anyone. Ah, but Mr. Risonho is very good. But his wife goes around screwing with everyone. You don't believe that? Leave it to me I'll talk to Manelao. He's my good friend. Good afternoon! Good afternoon! We grew up together. He's a close friend. - Do you want to talk to me? -You don't remember me? From the deal with the horse? Oh... You said that the Bainha had no defect. Bainha is cross-eyed. Yeah, I said the defect was in sight, his sight. What the fuck! Leave it to me, Manelao is a close friend. Good afternoon! - Good afternoon, sir. - Good afternoon! Farewell. - Good afternoon! - Good afternoon! Thank you. - How are you, Mr. Risonho? - I'm fine, Mr. Manelao. - I'd like to speak with you. - So, let's go. A blessing, godfather. A blessing, godfather. God bless you. - Stupid. - A blessing. Can I speak to you? Dismount! It doesn't even look like Mr. Risonho's hat. Just because it doesn't have 2 holes? (He's being two-timed) That's the price of pretty woman. That beautiful woman is that guy's? I've only been here for a short time. Yeah! Mr. Risonho's hat. Come with me. Protect my friend. Done. From the bad guys? Already sleeping? There are lots of bad folks out there. Come on. So, my friend? Your woman is always beautiful? - Well, we do as we can... - And children? She says she doesn't want any, they'll make her body ugly. That's a sin. God doesn't want it. I already told her.. It's just like I say... Don't be afraid, my son. I don't like this manners. What a disgrace! Bitch! My son! I want my son! Is she dead? God called her home. I didn't want her to suffer. That's a good chap. Come on, woman! Now you won't suffer any more. Wake up, dad! Wake up Wake up, dad! - Wake up, dad. - Go away. Ammunition.

The boys don't like to lose arace to a stranger. First, let's come in. I want to introduce an important person from Rio. It's a pleasure, Manelao. You're quite well-known outside of here. A pleasure, Imbrain. Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you, thanks. Please, come in. Let's go. This Manelao seems to be an immoral, pretentious guy. But useful. I think it is rash to give him so much slack. Everything in its time, Doctor. Mr. Manelao? What will we do with that person? The horse is really stolen? Stolen and good! A Christmas present for the boys. Done! I don't like thieves. But they're a necessary evil. Be careful! Come back! Come back! I don't like mistreating. Baiano! Baiano! - What is it? - The man wants you upstairs. You. You, You and You. Mineiro, Gaucho. Get the horses! To the convent? Yeah. Mineiro! Did you see my mare? I think she ran away With someone else. My friend, it's cheaper if we get married. Get out of here! Go! You sickening lazar! Let's go! You're a bitch! Give me the key to Mr. Manelao's room. There's a guest. That's not what I asked. Move! Well, well... Well, look at that hair of hers. Come on, get up here fast. Let's begin soon. Put this one on. Mr. Manelao might not like this a lot. Her manner seems suspicious. Something is going to go wrong here. I think it's better to tell Mr. Manelao. I'll do it. This is something for a man. I'm not a slut, you know! Some people don't like sluts. Don't you have a family? I do. Six feet under. They killed everyone, every last one. Except for Tonho. Who? Tonho! The brother who fled with some gypsies when he was little. Yeah? And you're jealous are you? Tonho. He's my brother! You don't like him? Tonho, my brother! You're jealous! How old was your brother? -Who? - Tonho. Tonho? Ten, 20, 30... ll guess he was about your age. - You never saw him again? - I don't think so. His name was Tonho? I think so. Isn't that the jerk that won the race? It seems that... Oh... Who is this jerk here? Don't know. How did he get in your room? I don't know, he just appeared there. Appeared... Who are you? I'm Tonho. It's Tonho... You're kind of good! Thanks. Who's the owner of these brave souls? Some guy called Manelao. - Manelao? -Um. - And the women? - His ladies. Who are you? I'm Tonho. Have you ever seen a guy get beat up with an armadillo tail? No... - Have you seen that? - No. Then, you'll see it now. Take that. Forget that, Mr. Tonho. What's this, Mr Tonho? Where are the others? Where are the others? In prison. Get your hand off! Put it down. Close the door. - Where are the guys? - Around. Let me go! That's an order. No one has pity on us. Open, open up open up. Open this up! I'm telling you. - What's so funny, sir? - Tonho! - Good morning. - Good morning. Do you know where some guy called Manelao is? He went down that way, about a half a league away. - Let's dismount? - Ok. - Good-bye. - Thanks Release the revolver. Where are you going? I'm going to see Mr. Manelao. Tell him, I'm waiting for him in the city. Get going, you brown noser. Let's accept that cheeky's invitation. OK. - Wait for me in the city. - Done. This isn't good, Mr. Tonho. Now it's Mr. Tonho.
