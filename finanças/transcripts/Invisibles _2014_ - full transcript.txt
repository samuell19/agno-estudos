Who's taking the herd out to graze? Atwa7 Didn't Dad tell you they sold the herd two days ago? Abu Risha is taking them at the end of the month. They sold the whole herd? -Except for this one... Look, you're not a kid anymore, you have to find a job, not play with the goats. Raed, come here a sec. Here. I gave some to Ali too. Look, he built a nice house. Soon you'll have to build your own. Hello. -Welcome. Please come in. Did you know that she and Ali teach at the same school? She's a good girl. You knew I'm getting discharged. Raed, enough. Your uncle and I are getting old.

To hell with them, I'm happy they're sold. He gave me money. -Who? My dad, after the sale. -Oh... So you're soned.
