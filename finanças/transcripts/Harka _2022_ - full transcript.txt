Ali told me about a place close to where we grew up. Way out in the desert, a lake appeared out of nowhere. Overnight. Crystal clear water sprung from rock and sand. It was perfect. Two old farmers found it one morning. People would come from far away just to swim there. Just to see it. No one knew how it got there. No one asked. It was a miracle. People where I live believe in magic and things like that. A few months later, somebody found out the truth. It was a sinkhole filled up with run-off from a nearby phosphate mine. But nobody cared. They still came from all over. They still swam. Then the water started changing. Poison, I guess it was. Water turned black. Just like that, no more swimming. Ali! I gotta show you something. Get out here! - What is it? - Just come out! What's that? I'm going to sell it. I got a buyer. It's just a jar. Man, this is an ancient Roman vessel! It's worth a fortune. - Let me see. - Easy! Look at the engraving. This isn't like the cheap shit from the market. - Where'd you get it? - At my uncle's. He's giving me half. And I'll give you a cut because you're my buddy. So what do you think? Are you in? I'm going to work. I need it this afternoon! Hurry up! Hurry the hell up! Go ahead! You'll be fine. Give me two more. You'd better pay by the end of the day, OK? Take another road and I'll call you back. Got a smoke? And a light? Hey boss! You can't smoke in front of the governor's building. Does it look lit? What's it like over there? - Cold. - Come on. I'm sweating my balls off here. - Do you have a girlfriend? - Fuck yeah I do. Tina. Tina's not a German name. A lot of German girls are named Tina. Hey, get me a beer. This one's warm. Service fucking sucks here. Buddy, it's Germany. In two years, I had it all. Money, bitches, a house, a car... You can't make shit here. How much do you make in Germany? I could buy you! I could buy everyone drinks if I wanted! - So what the fuck are you waiting for? - I don't pay for losers. Who do you mean? Figure it out. Motherfucker! I'll kill you! Get the fuck out! - I better not see you here again! - Who let them in here? Alyssa? Open the door. I don't have the key. Why are you bleeding? What are you doing here? What are you doing here? It's about Dad... With sky high unemployment, protests have resumed in the country. Illegal migration has also steadily risen in recent years. With many Tunisians buying their way to Europe through the black market. 450 Tunisians have already died this year crossing the Mediterranean by boat. My condolences. Alyssa told me. He's been sick for two years. - What was wrong? - Cancer. I'm glad you came. Will you come home with me? The girls miss you. So? We'll see. I was driving with Ridha. A cat was crossing the road. He's going full speed, and he fucking crushes the cat. Dead. A little cat, strolling around in the heat! He killed it and didn't bat an eye. I asked him, "Ridha, what the fuck?" He said he tried, but he couldn't avoid it. "Kill a human! Don't kill a poor cat!" You OK? You haven't said a word all night. I'm gonna get out of this country. - Illegally? - Yes, illegally. What are you talking about? Do you think it's that easy? You'll get your papers and come home with a car and money, just like that? - And they'll welcome you with music... - Fuck off. I'm not staying here. I won't die here like my dad. OK, say you can migrate. What will you do? You'll wander for one or two years until you get some papers. People over there are just as miserable. Man, Tunisia is your country. Everyone's like you. Everyone hates it here. You just live with it. Ali moved out of our house three years ago. He told me he was leaving for good. He had enough of it here. He said this country's full of crooks. They just look out for themselves. People pick away little pieces of you every day. Bit by bit. And if he stayed, they'd take enough of him that he'd just disappear. He was saving all his money. He was going to burn out. Cross the sea by boat. I pictured him drowning in the sea. And we'd never hear about it. He would just be gone. Then he'd really disappear. God, you've grown up. - How you been? - We're fine, and you? - What's all this? - Dad's things. I'm gonna sell them at the market on my way to work. - You're working? - Yeah. What do you do? I clean houses with my friend's mom. - What about School? - Dropped out. We need the money. We're broke. Where's your wife? She's visiting her family in Hammamet. Let's talk outside. What's going on? I got a job. Lucky you. What kind of job? Dishwasher and waiter. Where? Hammamet. In the tourist spot by the beach. Who'll look after the girls? We have no other choice. No more keeping us hungry! No more keeping us poor! No more keeping us down! Say it with me! No fear! No terror! The power belongs to the people! No fear! No terror! The power belongs to the people! You're a gang of thieves! Jobs are a right! You're a gang of thieves! Jobs are a right! We deserve jobs! Skander. Look, I'm not staying here. Next month, I'm leaving the country. Everything's ready. I can't take care of them. As soon as I make money, I'll send them cash. The bus is here. I gotta go. I can't stand the smell of cigarettes. OK, I'll go outside. Do you ever think about selling snacks with the gas? No. Think of yourself like a gas station. Drinks. SIM cards. Snacks. You'd make a lot more money that way. I gotta eat something. - Is this your car? - Why are you asking? Just a question. Is it for sale? I don't know. It's my dad's. I want to buy a car. - How much is it? - I said I don't know. It's not mine. - Do you have a license? - Why are you asking me? I'm only asking. Why are you afraid? What are you doing, boy? - That sign says the car's for sale. - Why are you talking to her? - What do you want? - I want to buy the car. Get in the car. How much is it? - So you want to buy a car? - Yes, I want to buy a car. You should buy a donkey. You can talk to it and ride it too. - What's your problem, asshole? - Fuck you, man! I know your type! Bums! - You're really cute. - I'll show you! I'll see you tonight. Ali. Why are you sleeping outside? What time is it? I'm going to work. Why'd you sleep outside? Do you live in that place I found you? Yes. - But it's a construction site! - Yes, indeed. - Is it yours? - The owner's abroad. What are you studying? - French. - Read something for me. Come on, do it. What does that mean? "Don't walk in front of me, I might not follow you. "Don't walk behind me, I might not lead you. "Walk beside me and just be my friend." He's right. Hey kid, can you drive? I don't have a license. Doesn't matter. Can you drive? Yeah. Want to work with me at the border? - No way. - Why? Cops are everywhere. They'll shoot me. That's no problem. All the roads are ours. Customs have drones. I don't want to get caught. - I'm not a smuggler. - That's no problem. There's a lot of money on the border. Real money. If you knew the kind of money you could make, you'd change your mind. You know what? Take your time, think about it, and then we'll talk. OK? Get going! A kilo of lamb chops. - For sale? - Yeah. - How much? - Twenty dinars. What should we call him? I don't know. Maybe... Rocks. Let me see his face. Rocks it is. Hold him like this. Here. His mother holds him that way. Easy. Don't be afraid, hold him. I held you like that when you were a baby. Stop it! I swear. Are you Salah Hamdi? It's the other street. Thank you. Who's that? How the hell would I know? Come eat. No thanks. Where'd you get this? I bought it. - What's that? - Ali bought him for me. How's work? Fine. The lady I work for is nice. Big house with a swimming pool. - Swimming pool? - Yeah. - Does she let you swim? - No. I need to speak with Salah Hamdi! What do you want from him? I'm a public notary sent by the bank. - Is he your father? - He's dead. He took a five-year loan from the bank. He failed to pay his debt for the last two years. He was sick. Still, the debt must be paid. How much does he owe? With the late fees, the balance is 8,000 dinars. There's no way we can pay that. I'm sorry, but if it isn't paid by the end of the month, his assets will be seized. What assets? She just told you we have nothing. Then the house will be seized. Get out of here. Get the fuck out! Next time, I'll be back with the police! - Go fuck yourself! - Remember this face! Fucking asshole! Did you know about this? Skander? What do we do? When? You said you'll help us. All right, all right. I hardly made anything today. Fucking prick. Where's the employment office? You left out your ID number. Here. Can I have a pen? Here? Alright. Why do you want to work here? My dad worked here for twenty years. I heard that the children can take their parent's position. - Where's your father? - He's dead. I wrote it there. What's your job now? I'm getting by. But I want a good job. You left out your mother's name. My mom died a long time ago. I gotta make more money. The bank will take our house and my sisters will be on the streets. I understand. I'm sorry, no jobs are available right now. His position has already been filled. Is there anything else? I don't see any education or specific training. - We have employment programs... - I need a job, not programs. Have you spoken with social services? I'll give you their number. Think about it and call them. The speedometer can never go under 180. The road from here to Libya is about six hours. If you notice anything the scout didn't see, get to the trails and off the road. Got it? Look, if the cops tail you, you floor it... - You got that? - Yeah. Go ahead. God be with you. You see that car up there? Take it easy, be cool. Just drive. Stay calm, stay calm. Careful. Stick to the left. Go, go, go. OK, OK. There's a check point up ahead. Turn off the lights. All good? All good. Ali would come home stinking like gasoline. He never talked much, but he told me a few things. Things he'd seen out there. He was driving. Saw the whole country, he said. Those places you see in the distance when you're on the highway, and you wonder if anyone ever walked on that land. I bet he stood places no one ever stood before. I think he felt like a ghost sometimes. Like people looked right through him. I wish I said something to him. I wish I told him I saw him standing in front of me, as real as anything else. And he'd just say, "Thank you." I think he felt sick in a way, inside him. And if he got too close to us, we could get whatever he had. I think that's why he slept outside all the time. But I liked knowing he was out there. Who are you? - Are you the adult here? - Yeah. We have an eviction order. The house is repossessed by the bank. I have the money. I'll pay half now and the rest next month. Unfortunately, the bank needs the full amount, plus late penalties. You have one week to pay everything in full. Take this. You need to understand this is happening. What a bunch of assholes. This guy orders one drink and spends the whole day in here. I'm turning people away and this son of a bitch just sits there staring. Don't get me wrong, I feel for the guy. He's got no job. Nothing. Poor bastard. But for fuck's sake, I need my tips. You OK? I'm alive. Leave it to God, buddy. Is it a money thing? Don't sweat it. One day you're up, then you're down. One day you're rich, then you're poor. Listen, I'm taking the bus to the coast. I'm selling the jar. Lot of rich tourists over there. Where? Here. - What do I do with it? - Buy vegetables. Candy. Whatever. - Where are you going? - To Hammamet. - Why? - I have to talk to Skander. For how long? - Ali? - God! What? Make sure you come back. I'll be back tomorrow! OK? Ten years after Bouazizi's desperate and dramatic protest that helped start revolutions across the region, frustration at the failed promise of the Arab Spring is widespread. That frustration has no more gruesome an expression than Tunisia's continued tide of self-immolations. I'll see you later. - What are you doing here? - I need help. Come here. I can barely get by. Things are slow. You said you'd help us. I'm broke. Life's hard. Rent's expensive. The bank is about to hit us. Your sisters will be on the street. Spare me the story, OK? Didn't you leave? Where were you? - Where were you? Did you help? - I'm here now. I'm here. Three years! Three years! I've been feeding them. Taking care of them. How do you think they lived? What did you do? How much can you give me? I'll try to get you something this evening. How much is something? I can't do more than 200. Enjoy your fucking life. What the fuck? - Fuck you! - What's wrong with you? Stop! Are you crazy? Get your fucking hands off me! 200 dinars? Calm down, people are watching us! What's wrong with you? Do you want me to get fired? Calm down. Sit down. - Have a seat. - Get off me. - Are you nuts? - I told you to get off. Let me get you a drink. I gotta get rid of this fucking jar. I should have known it was all cheap bastards here. Zombies. Wait here, I'll be back. Hello. - French, Italian? - Italian. This is real! Real! From ancient Rome. Is it real? You seem like a nice guy. This is a museum piece. Worth a fortune, but for you, 500 dinars. Five hundred? No way. OK, for you, 400. No. OK, 300, but that's it. How much did he give you? 50 dinars, that fucker. Let's go home. I need to do another run. Why not? I'm going alone this time. I want the other driver's share, too. You got it. Do you ever have the feeling when you're looking at something dangerous? Like, if you're standing on a tall bridge or something. You look all the way down. To the bottom. And a little part of you thinks, "What if I just jumped off it? What if I did that?" No, no, no! Pay me now! You hear me? I had to hitch rides all the way back! I want my money. Do you know I had to pay 15 grand to get the truck back? And the cargo you ditched. It's not my fault. I did what you asked me. I want my money. Take those two jerry cans, sell them, and we'll see later. Where were you? Where'd you go? We thought you weren't coming back! - I didn't go anywhere. - What if something happened to you? You go away all the time like it's no big deal. Nothing happened. - Look at me when I talk to you! - I'm here now. If you're going to leave like it's no big deal, then don't come back! Come sleep inside. I don't want to. I told you, I don't want to. Brother, please. I was going to flee the country. Really? Yeah. I had it with this place. Why didn't you do it? Go get some rest. Good night. We moved to the east part of town at the end of August. Sarra didn't seem to mind living at Ali's. When we got there, she didn't say much about it. She just said, "What do we do when it's winter?" I asked Ali one night, before we left, if he was sad he didn't run away like he wanted to. He said no, because people never actually run away from anything. I think we're all in our own little private traps. Clamped in them. And none of us can ever get out. We scratch and claw... but only at the air... only at each other. And for all of it... we never budge an inch. Ali, what are you doing over there? Come sit! Zohra, my neighbor... she has a lot of money. What do you think about her? Give me a fucking break with your stories. What's your problem? You're always so gloomy. Stay the fuck away from me. Just fuck off. Hit me so I can go. Today's fucked. I didn't make any money. You spent the whole day here and you didn't make any money? I'm not paying you today. Come on, spill it. I gotta go. You know this spot is forbidden, right? You think I like being here? Who gives a fuck if you like it! - Hit me so I can go... - What the fuck do you want me to do? - Watch your fucking mouth. - Why don't you go fuck yourself? Stop! Stop! Please, stop! You have no money? What's this? Liar! You make me sick. You stink like trash. The police are protecting the political mafia and the corrupt! I have the right to demonstrate and to protest! I know my rights! The constitution protects freedom of expression! Don't do it again or you'll never see the sun. - I need help! - Take a number. - Take a number first. - You have to help me now. How can we help you? I want to press charges. I want to press charges against the police The police? This is the municipality. We have nothing to do with the police. You have to help me now. What do I do? Should I fill this out? Sir, this is the municipality. You want to file a complaint? Go to the police station. Fuck the police station! Help me now! - Can you take a seat? - No, I'm not sitting! I swear to God, I'm not sitting until you make this right! - What's going on here? - Can you help me? - What is it? - I sell gasoline. The cops came and they fucked me out of all my money today. - Do you have a permit? - No. It's illegal to sell gas without a permit. Everyone does. How do you expect people to survive? Let me tell you something: we have no say in this. Even if you file a complaint here, we can't help you. This isn't our problem. - Calm down. - Calm down? - How can I fucking calm down? - Call the police. What the fuck is wrong with you people? What do you expect me to do, die? Assholes! Get fucked! Get out here! Who are you screaming at? - Open the door! - Open the door! - Quiet down. - Get out here! - Where's the governor? - He's not here! Get out of here! Open the door! I said quiet down! Will you shut up and get out of here? Go home! Why are you screaming? I have to speak with the governor. What do you want to tell him? Don't you know what you want to tell him? The police steal from me every day. The bank took our home. There's so much injustice, I'm losing my mind. Please, sister, help me. Please, I'm suffering here. He's in there, isn't he? He is here, but he can't help you. Do you think you can just storm in here and scream? If you keep this up, you're going to get yourself arrested. Open the door! Will you shut up and get lost? Listen to me, calm down... Get out here! Take your hands off me. Take your fucking hands off me! What do you want? Get your hands off me! Hands off! Hands off! Hands off! Why are you looking at me? - What's your problem? - What do you want? Money? - I don't want money... - I have nothing! Is this what you want? - Keep on moving. - Fuck you all! Fuck your corruption! He's crazy. Where'd you get that? I bought it. Come sit with us. Go ahead, eat. No thanks. Enjoy. Shall we go visit Skander? OK. Can we swim there? Yes, you can swim. I'm buying tickets. I'll be back. Where's your ticket? I'm staying here. Why aren't you coming? Come here. - Let me have that bag. - You're not coming? What is that? - This is 6,000 dinars. - 6,000? Just for you two. Use it however you want. The bus is about to leave. I'll see you soon.
