- It was a good game today, wasn't it? - 4-0! We crushed them! - Yes, we crushed them. - They sucked, though. Yes. However, Marcolino never passes the ball. I just hate it when, after getting past two players, he stubbornly goes ahead, only to lose possession. He's not Maradona. - You can get past 1-2 players, but then you have to pass. - Exactly. Luca, the new kid, seems to be quite strong. He's so strong! - I thought he wasn't fit to play, because he's short. - He's short. But he's very fast. His penetrative passes are great! Yes, he's good. And Marcolino made two incredible shots from midfield, didn't he? - Don't you remember? - Ah, yes, it's true. He sent the ball so far that... Although their goalie was bad, he nearly saved a shot. - Bye, now. - Bye. See you at the pitch tomorrow. - Bye, Vale. - Bye. You're a fucking bitch! You're nothing! This is my house, understand? This is my house, you shitty bitch! You're a bitch, Anna! Get that fucking hand off me! You need to understand that this is my house! Do you think I'm afraid of your report? You aren't worth a shit! You're a slut! I've been following you. - Don't touch me with your fucking hands! - Please, calm down! I'm gonna break your fucking head! You aren't worth a shit! You have to say you are a woman who isn't worth a shit! You're a woman who isn't worth a shit! Valerio... Valerio... "Attention: train approaching Platform 21. "Stand behind the yellow line." The Possible Life I just need to use the toilet. You slept quite a bit, huh? You'll like Carla. We'll be fine at her place, you know? She's nice. We had a lot of fun when she lived in Rome. I used to accompany her to every audition. We lived in the same house for nearly 3 years. I know. You've already told me a thousand times. - What is it? - Nothing. How long until we arrive? We'll be there soon, in half an hour. Are you tired? Hey! I was at the other exit. Ta-da! My dear, my dear... I'm really happy! And this is Valerio! He's gorgeous! How you've grown! Give it to me. Jeez... Here we are. Why are you doing this? Go away! Enough! You're breaking my balls! Leave me alone or I'll come back with my father! - Get him here! - He'll kick your ass! Yeah, right. Just let me talk to him! Go away! Holy shit... Christ! - He did it again. - That piece of shit! I'm sorry. Here we are. Come. Come on in. Put down your suitcases. Make yourselves comfortable. Here we are. Here it is. Well, it's not very big. It's a bit small, but... Don't worry. We won't stay here long. Please don't start. Stay as long as you like. Do you know that your mom and I lived together? Yes, yes, I know. Oh my God, I have a kid in my house! Everyone will envy me! Come, I'll show you around. - Here's my room. Oops! It's too messy. I'll show it to you later. - OK. The bathroom. Here's the kitchen, which is the most beautiful part of the house. - And here is my wonderful sitting room. My kingdom. - Yes. I'm sorry, love, but I don't have a TV. - I detest it. - Don't worry. I'm sorry! Come, I'll show you your room. It's upstairs. Nice, isn't it? Come. "And there was light." Here we are. I know: there are many steps to climb. Anna, you'll get a great figure! So... - The bed is double because sometimes I rent the room. - Good. - There's a small bathroom. - Ah! It's out of service. But they'll come and fix it within the week. You can use the one downstairs in the meanwhile. Then... The bed. Feel it! Hey, aren't you sleeping yet? No. I mean, after the day we've had... I'll tell you that I'm sleepy, if you want me to. Hey... What's the matter? Nothing. Stop. Well... Listen... I'm going downstairs to have a little chat with Carla. - Hey... - OK. Read just two pages and that's it. - Okay? - Yes. This house is very beautiful. Yes. It belonged to one of my aunts. She was a spinster. That's probably why I haven't found a husband yet. - I've had a lot of men, though. - Good. I'm glad you've come here. Really. I wish that piece of shit came here looking for you: I'm waiting for him! I just don't understand... After all the times you reported him, the injunction... wasn't he afraid? I mean... He would enter the house anytime he pleased, he'd beat you and then leave. Is that how it worked? That seems absurd to me. Absurd. Well, yes... The whole situation was absurd. I don't even know how to explain it. Let's talk about you. It's more fun. It's almost comical! Look: at my age... zero family, zero career... Come on... If I didn't have my parents to help me... I'm like a child: I get into trouble all the time, with men, with work, with anything... Telling you to come and stay with me is the first right thing I've done in years. Really. Besides buying this splendid nail polish. It's really nice, yes. You look tired. Go to sleep. Thank you very much, Carla. So, how is it? - It's good. - It's good, isn't it? Delicious. So... That's the Porta Palazzo market. - There are fruit and vegetables. It's full of people. It's wonderful! - Good. And... there's the bike shop. - Do you like riding a bike? - Yes, but... Great! Everyone rides a bike here. Look. True! Everyone but me! People in the neighbourhood still remember the last time I rode a bike! I smashed myself on the cobblestones. Everyone around me was saying: "Madam! Madam!" "She's dead!" Someone said: "She's dead!" However, you'll like it here. - Hey! Call that piece of shit of your boss. - Calm down. - Call him! - Calm down! I'll call him. Come outside. I'll break your fucking face! It's your son who always comes here and... - You mustn't even mention my son! - Domenico, come. Ignore him. Go away. Go back to the kitchen, you fucking Frenchman! Isn't it enough, what you did to that kid? You bastard, I'll smash your face in! Mathieu, calm down! Come here! I'm here. Come! I'll come back. I'll come back... (in Piedmontese) Go to work, you jerk! Go home! Valerio? Coming. Help! Valerio... Valerio... Calm down. Shh. It's just a nightmare. Calm down. Mom is here with you. Mom is here with you. Don't worry. Calm down. Calm down. Please, madam... Madam? To your left, madam. "I don't have to stay here and listen to you." "You're destroying me. You're destroying me!" "No, what I heard last night is enough." "I'm long gone." "Maybe you see me. You think you see me, "but I'm gone." Hey! Good morning, kid! - Hi. Sorry. - No. Come! There's nobody! Why? Did you think there was someone here? Yes. Then that means I'm really good. Good morning. Mom's not home. She left early because she had a job interview. She'll catch up with us later. Do you want some coffee? No, a 13-year-old shouldn't drink coffee. I don't have any milk, though, because... I often forget about it, it goes bad, and then I have 3-4 expired bottles in the fridge. But I have some juice! I have some boiled ham, some juice, and these delicious chocolate cookies. Come on, sit here. The glass... Here. I have to get on with my work, OK? So... - Would you read me the lines? - I don't know how to do it. It's very easy. You are that asshole of Antonio. - You're an asshole, because you're my husband and you're cheating on me. - OK. You just need to read Antonio's lines. Just read them, okay? Wait, okay? "You have to go." "I'm staying." "This is my house." "Our house." - "Leave!" - "No, I'm not leaving." - "Why? Tell me why!" - "Because I love you." "Fuck off, you asshole, you bastard!" - That's not in the script. - Yes, I know. Sorry. I got carried away. Don't worry. You're doing great. Let's go on. - Can I just go to the bathroom? - Sure! Thanks. I'll keep rehearsing. - I have a surprise for you later. - Ah. - Later, later... - Okay. Don't use your feet if you aren't able to! Pass it here. Pass it, quick! Come on! The ball! Quick! Hurry! - There he is! - Where have you been? - On a ride. - Do you know what time it is?! - I'm half an hour late. - I told you to stay here! - No, you didn't! - Yes, I did! You're making a big deal out of nothing! - You'd better shut up! - No, I won't shut up; I didn't do anything wrong! Then you won't ride this bike again for a long time. - Why? - Because you're an idiot! Go to lock it. - Why? - Go to lock it, I said! It's my fault. I'm sorry! I gave him the house keys and got him a bike without asking if it was OK with you first. It's his fault! He's so sweet. I couldn't treat him like this. Now I understand why I could never be a mom: moms are too mean. "Too mean"? Yes. You mothers are too mean. - How long is that asshole going to take? - I don't know. - Here he is. - Finally you're here. Did you call him? - He's not coming. - Why not? - I don't know. - Give me that fucking ball. - So it's just the three of us. - No, Nico is waiting for us. Nico sucks at playing! He's worse than you. Let's go. "Hi, Valerio, my little boy. "I cannot find the words to tell you how much I miss you. "It makes me sick not to know when I can see you again. "And not knowing where you are is driving me crazy. "I apologize a thousand times. "I was wrong. But everyone makes a mistake sometimes. "I swear I keep thinking about how I've ruined everything. "You're the most important thing in my life, "and my biggest dream is to continue to raise you with your mother. "She doesn't understand that I still love her. "But if only she gave me one last chance, "we could start over together, as a true family. "When you listen to the CD I gave you, "remember that Dad loves you very much, "and that he looks forward to holding you again. "Tell your mother it's not too late to start over... "because I love her. "I love you so much. "Dad" - Please... - Thanks. Hi, Valerio. Come with me. I'll show you around the school. - I'll wait here, OK? - Please come, too, madam! In the afternoon, we also offer some guitar courses here, if you're interested. I'm taking Valerio with me to the rehearsal today, so he won't be home alone, and you'll go to the job interview more relaxed. What is it? He asked my father to send me a package. For Valerio. - Who, him? - Yes. And...? It contained a letter for him, and a CD. Did you read it? Yes. And... he wrote that he loves me, he really misses Valerio and he'd like us to return home. Oh, sure! That big piece of shit... Throw it away! He never hurt Valerio, though. I should think not! I don't know... I feel like I've decided for us all. Anna, you did the right thing! Should you ever think of going back home, open any newspaper: every day some woman in your situation is found dismembered inside a bag. "You're not that type of woman." "What type?" "Does a type exist?" "Your bags are waiting for you in the other room." "This theatre is for sale. Nothing is ours anymore here." "Do you see?" "Nothing." "Leave." Yes. As if you were about to kiss him. Stick out your lips. Like this. Show them to him. Good. "Leave." "You're playing with me." "Yes. And I like it a lot." "Shut up!" (in Russian) Look, we have a "client"! What do you want? What are you looking at? Are you a statue or are you stupid? He's stupid! Don't you understand? Go away! Go away! (in Russian) - What an idiot! - What a fool! - Bye, Alejandro. - Bye. Bye, Carla. At some point I lost sight of you. Where were you? I was... out here, walking around. I swear... really. - Did you get bored? Didn't you like it? - No, no, it was great, instead! - Did you see our scene? - Yes, your scene... with him. It was wonderful! Really. I'm not an expert, but... it was beautiful. He's good. You're very good. But you cook better than I do. Really. - What do we do? Are you hungry? - Yes. Yes, it arrived a few days ago. No, no! You don't need to worry. Really. Hmm... no. Not yet, but... I'm sure I'll find a job. I'm sure... Yes. Yes. Valerio is fine. He feels a bit lonely, of course, but now... Yes... he's starting school. Sure. Hmm... not now. He's sleeping. I'll have him call you back, huh? Okay. Yes. Listen... say hello to Mom for me, okay? Good night. Bye. Who was on the phone? I thought you were sleeping. It was Grandpa. Really? Yes, of course. - Who did you think it was? - I thought it was Dad. No, no. It wasn't him. Haven't you been in touch with him? No. - Why? Do you miss him? - I only asked if it was Dad. - My feet are like ice! - What are you doing?! They're cold! - Will you warm them up? - They're cold! - Warm them up a bit. - Stop! - Come on... - Stop, Mom! Buy yourself a hot water bottle. - If you warm them up, I'll give you your bike back, OK? - OK. I'll take any job. I want to earn my own money. - I need it. - Yes. So I can buy something nice for Valerio. A sweatshirt, a book... I wish they hired me! I'm sure they'll hire you. Yes. I feel it. I'm sure. Little by little, things will get better, you'll see. Do you believe me? (Russian dialogue) Your "client" fell! - He's really stupid. - Shut up. Do you want to nurse him? Try with your tongue! Shut up, you imbecile, and go to work! Let me see how bad it is. Stay still! You're really an idiot! Stay still. Come on, get up. Come on, it's just scratched, not broken! Go away. (in Russian) - You stupid! - What a client you've found! How is it going at school? Badly. Did you make some new friends? No. You'll make some soon, you'll see. It takes some time, you know. But the school seems to be very nice. You'll like it. And the principal is really a kind person. I'm going to bed now. I'm tired. OK, go to bed. I'm coming, too, because tomorrow morning I'll have to wake up early. - I'm going. - Okay. - It's quite a hard job, you know? - Yes, I know. And you have to be fast. It won't be a problem. There are 3 shifts. There's also an evening shift. - Are you willing to work in the evening? - Sure. Your colleague already told me about it, during the interview. No problem. You have children, don't you? Yes, a 13-year-old son. Why? Then you have a good reason to work hard. Yes. Listen... I think you could already start next week. Yes. The lady who will assign you a task is outside. Thank you! Thank you very much! - Well, goodbye. - Goodbye. Valerio? Valerio, where are you? Carla? Hello. Valerio? Are you sleeping? Hey. My God! Carla, Valerio is with you, right? No? Oh my God! Carla, he read the letter! No, no. I'll call you. I'll call you, okay? Listen... Excuse me... Have you seen my son, that kid with a bike? - No, I was inside. - Gosh. Hello? No, he's not at school. I called them. I can't find him anywhere. I have no idea where he went. What's going on? My son's gone! Please help me! I don't know where he went. He's not at school. I saw him. He went that way on his bike. Come, come. - Give me the keys. - They're in the car. Close it. He's there. Valerio! Go away! - Please... - Go away! Please, Valerio, get down! It was a nice letter! It was a nice letter! For me! But you hid it from me. Valerio, listen: I was afraid. I thought that... if you read it, you'd want to go back to him. - And now I'd like to! - No... I'm sorry. - It was Dad on the phone the other day, right? - No. - Why should I believe you? - I swear. It wasn't him. Believe me. I swear. Please, get down! Please, Valerio! I've found a job, you know. It was supposed to be a surprise. I'll start working next week. I bought that to celebrate together. Hey... Listen: I could... try to make things right with Dad, huh? We left all of a sudden... Do you want us to go back to Rome? No. - You're not doing it for me, are you? - No. Look: I got you this. So I can know where you are at all times. (in Piedmontese) Fucking Lopez! Why isn't he shooting? How can one play like that? Come on, pass that ball! - Hi. - Hi. Go over there, so you can see it better. Would you like something? - I have no money. - It's on me. - A coke? - Yes, please. "The ball is out of play. Throw-in by Moretti. (...)" - Here you are. - Thanks. Still 0-0, huh? (in Piedmontese) - Go to work! - Go to eat! - Go, Juventus! - Go away! (indistinct chattering) We wasted two scoring opportunities. What do you want? Nothing. I just wanted to thank you. For my knee, I mean. It doesn't hurt anymore. So what? I felt like I had to tell you. I have to go home now. See you tomorrow. Bye. That's what avant-garde is. Light, eyes... nothing else. - Not Stanislavski, not concepts... - What is he saying?! - Not only eyes! - Eyes are very important. - What about presence? - Presence is important, but... an actor acts with his eyes. Look at Carla. - Carla is also good. - Yes, she's good, but... Carla is good, but it's also the director who illuminates... - Look also at... What's your friend's name? - Anna. - Look at Anna's eyes. They're wonderful. - Beautiful. If I put her on the stage, with the right illumination, she's perfect, she doesn't need to speak. - What a sweet-talker! - I'm not sweet-talking her. Yes, she's perfect. Look at her eyes; they're deep, liquid... - Guys, we're out of wine. - I'll get some more. OK. - White or red? - Red. I'll help you. - What a sleazebag! - Look at him! - I didn't mean to embarrass you, sorry. Did I embarrass you? - No. But it's true. I wasn't kidding. You have a very interesting face. Your eyes, your look... And this small scar, here, makes you very charming. It gives you something deep. - Valerio... What is it? - Is he your son? - Yes. - I need some water. - We woke him up. - It's in the fridge. Go ahead. - He's cute. He looks like you. - Thank you. Will you take care of the wine? - What happened? - Nothing. I was thirsty. Ah. Come on, let's go. These pests are about to leave. Ouch! Wait! Hey, relax. Excuse me... I just wanted to thank you. Don't mention it. Is your son all right? Yes, thank you. Hmm... Have a nice day. - You too. - Thanks. Come. Come on. Come here. Come here. Come. Sweetie, you have to lock the door, or our bikes will get stolen. - Didn't you read the sign? - Sorry. - Have you just moved in? - Yes. - How come you know Jarry? - I don't even know who that is. Mathieu Jarry, the restaurant's owner. I saw you talking to him. Do you really not know him? He even played in the big leagues for Torino FC. He quit because he killed a kid. My father says he's gone half mad. Haven't you noticed that he talks to cats? Anyway, I've warned you. Do what you want. - Bye. - Bye. Lunch is on the table and the dessert is in the fridge. I hope it went well today. See you later. Love. Mom - Do you want to challenge your father? - Yes. Come on, Dad! What are you doing? Come on! I've got it. - Nutmeg! - A nutmeg against your father! Are you challenging me? Come, come! Come on, Dad! Guys, lunch's ready. Coming! Come on, let's go. Come on, lunch's ready! - Bye. - Bye. - Bye. - I'm coming with you. - Thanks! Pass it! Careful! Are you here again? Are you in love with me? What do you want? - I've brought a hot chocolate. - Good. Drink it. It's for you. Dumb face, do you know what I'm doing here? Yes. Why do you come here, then? - Don't you have any friends? - No. Except for Mathieu, the footballer. Do you know him? Dunno... I know many men! So? Will you give it to me or not? You're really weird. - What's your name? - Valerio. - And yours? - Larissa. Ah. What are you looking at? You'll make me choke on it. Do you like it? It's good. Take it. Hi. Hi. It's the shifter. It will break sooner or later. There's a problem with the chain. Bring it here. We'll try to fix it. Thanks. You're good with bikes. I won the Tour de France ten times. - I know who you are. - You do? Yes. A kid told me about you. I also read your story online. You know all about me, then. May I ask you a question? Go ahead. Is it true, what they say, that you killed a kid in an accident? He came out of nowhere. It was dark... I couldn't avoid him. Did you go to jail? No... I didn't, unfortunately. I've only lived here for a short time. My mom and I lived in Rome before, but we had to escape. Why? Well, because... because my father used to beat her. Did you see the scar she has on her forehead, here? He did that to her. He slammed her head against the table, hard. Is it really broken? Are you kidding? Look! I told you: I won the Tour de France 10 times! 11 times! Look how fast it's going! You're great, Mathieu! - Do that thing with your foot again. - Yes. That's cool! Look! Yesss! Look! - What do you want? - Can I accompany you? Where do you want to accompany me to, dumb face? Go away. Still here? - Don't you have a family? - I live with my mother. Stay with her, then! What do you want from me? I have nothing to do. How tall are you? 163 cm. - What's your shoe size? - 38 (24 cm). Tomorrow at 4 pm, be in front of the statue of the soldier. Where people skate. You'll come with me to a place. - You got it? - Yes, yes. - Tomorrow at 4 pm, in front of the statue of the soldier. - Good. Go away. Go. Hi, Anna. What are you doing here? Do you want a ride? No, thank you. The bus will drop me off in front of my house. This area isn't very safe at this time of night. I'll drop you home. I'm going that way. Come on, get in. Don't worry. Thanks. Are you doing fine here in Turin? Yes, I'm doing very fine. - But you miss Rome a bit, don't you? - No... no. I'm fine with Carla. Obviously. Carla is a special person. Yes... I've been thinking about you a lot lately. I was serious the other night. Maybe we could exchange numbers, if you wish. I asked Carla for your number, but she has many secrets about you! Maybe we could go out sometime, if you like. Huh? Yes, yes. Okay. Here we are. This is a limited-traffic zone and you risk a fine; drop me off here. - No, I'll drop you off at home. - No, thank you. I'd like to walk a bit, because... Okay. Here. Thank you. - Bye. Good night. - Bye. And thanks. Good night. Anna. We forgot something. - What? - We didn't exchange numbers. - Lock the chain. - Yes. I'll take the key. - But I'll see you again. - Let me upstairs. Offer me a glass of wine. - No, sorry. My son is there. - I'll offer you one, then. There's a nice place around the corner. Just 10 minutes. No. Next time. Call me and we'll meet. - How can I call you? You didn't give me your number. Come on. - Let go of me! - Don't be childish. I won't hurt you. - Let me go in. - Hey, leave me alone! - Leave her alone! - What the fuck do you want? - Gosh! Gosh! You son of a bitch! If I see you again, I'll kill you. Beat it! - Knock, knock! - Yes? Come in. - Hey... Wow! - Hi. - You look so cool! - Thank you. - Are you going on a date? - No, no. - You look like you're going on a date. - No. - Did you meet some girl at school? - No, I don't know anyone there. They're bitchy... aren't they? Don't worry; girls are always bitchy when they're little, but then they change. I haven't changed, though. - Want a ride? - No, thanks. Show me how you look at them. - Perfect! Well... bye. - Bye. - Bye-bye. - Bye. Hey. Lock your bike. Come on, lock it! - How old is your brother? - He's your age. Otherwise I wouldn't have asked you to try those clothes on for him. Look. He looks like me! "He looks like you"?! He doesn't have a dumb face like you. Just kidding. Do you have to go home? No. Why? Do you like to shoot? - Yes! - Well done! - Hi. - Hi. - Are you eating in? - Hi. - Hi. No, I'm taking away. - What would you like? - A hamburger. - Domenico? - Yes? - A hamburger to take away. - Do you want fries with that? Yes. - Sit down. - A hamburger and some fries to take away. So, how are you? - I'm fine. - And it shows! - Why? - From the look of you... I went to the Luna Park today. With a girl. Did you meet her at school? No, in the park, where I ride my bike. She's always there. - And what does she do there? - She's older than me. Her name's Larissa. She's a foreigner. Like me. Good! Here, here. Let's switch roles. Come on. Your turn. Wait. There. So? Another shot? - Good morning. - Good morning. May I see your ID, please? - What's the problem? - Just a routine check. - You need to come with us. Please. - What happened? Nothing. Don't worry. Go home. Don't worry. Please... When a woman says no, a man should fuck off! - Shh! Valerio is there! - Sorry. He doesn't know anything. Couldn't you have kicked him in the balls? The Frenchman did the right thing! He should have left him there, on the ground. That bastard... I want to go to the police station and tell them exactly what happened. Huh? I don't want him to get into trouble because of me. Turin Central Police Station - Bureau of Investigation - (Russian dialogue) - Do you have a condom? - Wait. Thank you very much. Go away! Go away! Go! Hey! - What's going on? - What the fuck do you want? - Calm down! - Let the fuck go of me! - Hey, calm down! - Valerio! What happened? What happened? Valerio! What happened? Do you have problems at school? - I don't have to tell you anything. - Yes, you have to! - Why? Have you ever told me anything, except a lot of bullshit? - "Bullshit"? First you said you'd work everything out with Dad; then you said it'd be great in Turin. Yeah, really "great"! Can't you see that I have no friends? I no longer have friends, or a life! I only have that fucking bike, which I always ride alone like an idiot! I don't even have a fucking room where I can lock myself in not to see you! Go away! I hate you! Go away! Nino Bixio Public Middle School Your son has seen his father's violence against you, and, suddenly, he has found himself in a new city that he doesn't know. Without his friends, his family, his points of reference. These outbursts are more than understandable and it is necessary to help him, especially in this preadolescent stage. Of course. I just want to protect him, but I don't know how. We can put you in touch with... the Developmental Psychological Services in your area. - You'll find qualified persons who can help him there. - Good. - When can I take him there? - At any time, but... the child's father also has to agree. Without both parents' consent, they won't be able to assist him. - But I can't ask his father for anything. - I know. I'm really sorry. Unless the judge orders the termination of the father's parental rights... Sorry, I don't understand... The father will never give his consent. He doesn't even know we're here. He mustn't know anything. You do realize that I escaped, right? I reported him, I escaped, and I came here. I understand, madam. You're right. But this is the law. - The law?! - In cases like yours, it's absurd, but it's the law. The conditions to help your son are not met. But you... Do you need some support, some help? No, I don't. I don't need anything. - I've brought you the dessert you like. - I'm not hungry. - Well, you look hungry. - Ah, I look hungry? Are you happy now? - It has been there for days. It'll rust. - Never mind. It's a nice bike. I'm no longer using it. Can I sit down? Did something happen? No. Are you sure? I saw her in a car. She was with an old man! I should have killed him... but I ran away! But... - you know that she's a... - Yes, yes. But she's my friend. What can I do? Maybe you could write a letter to her. I'll take it to her, if you want. What do you think? But you shouldn't go there anymore. It's dangerous for her, too. I didn't mean to answer you like that, last time. I was angry. I'm sorry. Here. I locked it for you, to prevent it from getting stolen. I didn't mean to hurt you. I was a fool. I'll never come and bother you again. But I want you to know that that day at the Luna Park was wonderful, and I'll never forget it. Valerio To Larissa I don't hate you. I never hate you. I'm glad. I say it, but I don't mean it. It's just that sometimes I get angry and I pick on you. Then I think back on it, and I feel bad. I don't know why I act like that. I can't help it. I'm sorry. Don't worry. - It's nice here. - Yes, it is. I like it. Except for the TV! - But I can watch it at the restaurant. - Do you go there often? To watch matches, and not to eat alone. And the owner is nice. - He told me I shouldn't fight with you. - Ah, now I understand why... - No, I was going to tell you anyway. - Yeah, right. - Really! - Yeah... - Are you working tomorrow? - No, tomorrow is my day off. Why? I was wondering if you want to go out. - With whom? - With me! - With you? - Yes. We'll see. I'm not sure I can. - So? - It's horrible! Why? All those shitty colours on the walls... And it's small! It's a hole! It will be fine for me and Valerio. And it's inexpensive. - "Inexpensive"? But my house is free! - What do you mean? What?s with you? You're going to leave me alone, then. Are you serious? Yes. I've got used to you. - It's not like we're packing up and leaving. - Almost... Come on! "Great"... - Just thinking of it makes me so sad! - Hey, you'll make me cry. - I'm getting wrinkles! Look. - Yes, you're getting a few. Besides, Valerio helps me rehearse, he makes me laugh... I'll buy a TV, if you want. This big! This big? Huh? - All right, you know what? I'll get a dog. - Good! - I'll get a dog! - Sure. That friend of mine who sold me the bike found a little dog in the street. He said he wanted to take it to the pound, but maybe he still has it. Thanks. Thanks. This is nice. - Excuse me... Hello. - Hello! - How are you? - Fine. I wanted to thank you for your deposition. Ah... - I hadn't thanked you yet, so... - I'm the one who must thank you. For what? For many things. - Did you ever see that man again? - No, no. - Now it's better, right? - Yes. Hmm... can I offer you a coffee? Yes... I'd like that, but I can't: my friend went to buy something, but I don't know where she went, and... Another time, then. Yes. Thank you. - Anna! - Ah, here she is! - Do you want a hand with that? - Gosh! It's very heavy! - Wait... okay. - What did you buy? It costs little but weighs a lot. - Can you do it? - Yes. - Thanks. - Poor man! - It's very nice. - Indeed. - 10 euros. - Hey... It's a bargain. It's a kid. Ah. - Good morning. - Hello. Is your son in? He's not my son. Wait. - Valerio? - Here I am. - He's my nephew. - Ah. Here she is. Here's my... Here's my little dog! Give her to me! Lola! Oh my gosh! Lola! - Hi. - Hi. What happened? Nothing. He and his friends invited me to play football with them. - Good! - Can I go? - Sure. Go, go! - Thanks. - Go and get your things. - Yes. I'll get a shirt and my jacket. - What happened? - They invited him to play football with them. - Cover yourself up. - Yes. - Bye. - Bye. Hey. - Bye. - Bye. How beautiful you are! Good girl! You're a genius! You're a genius! Take it! English subtitles by YRR and Alex
