We see our ancestors through the fabric of history, as distant figures whose fates and deeds echo down through the ages like ripples on a river. They become mere shadows that define an event. Anonymous impressions of triumph or tragedy that fill our history books. Through the distance of time, details of what was, are lost. Only simple impressions remain. Of moments, actions, lives, deaths. The stories we tell ourselves and our children are not always what was... but what we wish them to be. Innocent victims. Daring escapes. Unredeemable villains. Defiant martyrs. Sometimes, it is even the truth. Halt! Look at my face, Turks, and remember it well as you burn in hell. My sisters and their children have gone to their freedom and now I follow them to mine. You will never conquer us. They would murder their own children to rob the Empire of future warriors. Who are the barbarians here? There was no sign of Stavros in the village. But that Greek spy cannot evade us forever. Is there anything more to be done here, brother? Captain? There's nothing more here. Send word to prepare a ship for Istanbul. The sultan must hear of this. Captain Tariq requests a ship. Kill any survivors left in the village. So, tell me, cousin... Mmm. Mustapha? Yes? What good news do you bring to our court from Tripolitsa? I will allow Captain Tariq to illuminate Your Highness with our good news. Your Highness, we have secured new trade routes. The flow of goods into the Empire are more plentiful each day. And your palace bears the proof of this, Your Highness. What also grows, Your Highness... is the Greek appetite for rebellion. This hunger in their bellies is not new. After 400 years, have we not found ways to curb such appetites? I will not let my first year of rule be tarnished by such rebellion. We will send more soldiers, we will conscript more of their sons, we will take their daughters, and we will burn their lands. We will starve them out of the will to defy you. Your Highness, would we slaughter our cattle to avoid a stampede? I can hear the wisdom of your father speaking through you, Tariq. Your insights would have made him proud. And I trust that you will always do right by me and the Empire. But... the Greeks refuse our good grace at their own peril. I will leave you to your duties. Thank you, Captain. First it was Souli, and now Levidi. If the Empire continues on this path, we will have nothing left to rule in Greece but gravestones and ruin. The Ottomans have always ruled with a bloody hand. And that has been the lesson taught to my fellow Greeks for centuries. Yet it seems that the only lesson they have learned is that it is better to die than to live under our rule. Even their women and children saw no hope nor future in living. There must be a better path to peaceful rule. Oh, I see these women and children have at last impressed upon you what this old man has been trying to teach you for 20 years. I know that now, Thanasi, my old friend. There's something else, isn't there? What unsettles you? On the cliffs, there was a young Greek child. All of her people lay dead on the rocks below by their own hands. I could have helped her join them, and yet I chose to spare her life rather than take it. I thought it merciful. Perhaps. But if you left her to live in this world alone, then you spared her nothing. Only God knows what will become of her. I will never forget the terror in those blue eyes. Anna. Anna Christina? Anna Christina, Mana wants you. Where's your brother? He's with Baba. Then I will race you. Go! Come on. Better run faster than that. Move along, practice here. Demetri, Vangeli... Bring a chair for your Yia Yia. We thank God for the establishment of the Ottoman Empire, which has preserved our Orthodoxy and sustained our very existence. His great wisdom is extended to us through the authority and guidance... There she is. Of Sultan Mahmud II... Have a seat. Whom the faithful are commanded to obey. By the grace of the Sublime Porte... we share in the fruits of their prosperity. Thank you, Lord, for the Ottoman overlords who steal our food for their pleasure... Vangeli. Homes for their comfort and destroy all that is holy and Greek. And all those you have placed in authority over us. Amen. Amen. Nicolaki, aim for my hand. Yes, Baba. This is the target. Alexi, a little higher. Try now, boys! Good, that's it. Yes! You will be freedom fighters yet. Yeah! If only you could foresee this sneak attack! Do my little brothers look for a fight already, Baba? They must be prepared to do their part. If the time comes. Come, come! Hyah! When the time comes. And it will. Hyah! Guards returning! Field reports confirm that Theodoros Kolokotronis has returned to Greece and that men from the villages rally to his call for rebellion. If the peasants believe that this thief in exile is their saviour, then they are fools. The sultan desires to keep peace, so much as it can be kept. Your closeness to the sultan does not change the facts, Colonel. We now fight insurrection on several fronts. As long as our steel is stronger than their discontent... we will maintain the peace the sultan seeks. Then we require more information on these rebels. If Kolokotronis recruits in nearby villages like Valtetsi, then that is where we must start. My Janissaries will ride into these villages under the colonel's command and show our strength whilst seeking information from our local informants. I have a question. Yes, Mustapha Bey? Is there any more wine in that? Oh, well. Never mind. This same conversation, it just grows so tiresome. It's time for more pleasurable company. Your fascination with that blade has not waned since childhood. My father could not have gifted you anything more suitable. And I continue to honour the great general he was through every drop of heathen blood that touches this blade. The wars waged at the edges of the Empire will soon be at our gates. Let them come. We will crush them as we always have. Why not discourage rebellion rather than fuel it? Let us limit the amount of blood your blade must draw, if we can. I have noticed your appetite for war has much abated through the years, Tariq. And yours has not been satisfied. And we've always made a balanced team, my brother-in-arms. Fortunately, I have enough such hunger for both of us and will gladly cover your share. Your thirst for Greek blood is too often exercised for one who carries some of his own, my friend. If I cannot purge this contamination from my own veins, then I shall surely do so from theirs. My family never treated you as any less than a Turk for it. Do not let your own demons cloud your perspective. With respect, my demons are my concern. Then let our mere presence keep the villagers in line. Maybe we'll find the whereabouts of that spy Stavros that has vexed you for so many years. Attention! Open the gates for clearance inspection. Open the gates! Open the gates! We ride for Valtetsi within the hour! You will not find better quality than this, my friend. How many times must we tell them? The merchants should be made to stay clear of the palace gates. See to it that he's moved immediately. You see, Tariq? There's no need for diplomacy. One crack of the whip and these old goats are just like lambs... ready for the slaughter. Anna! Baba? Almost ready, my friends! Alexi! What a blessing to celebrate your birth on the Name Day of the Virgin. Christo, Christo... I now see why you've raised the village taxes again. The taxes are high for our protection. If you care to debate the matter, you may speak to these gentlemen, if you wish. And that I wear what befits a man of my station is no concern of yours, boy. Anna Christina. Constantine. May I have a word in private about my proposal? Two thousand piastres is a meagre dowry for your daughter to carry the honour of my name. She shares the name of her aunt, Christina Kanelos. It is she who would bring honour to you. Hmm. Yes, well, either way, I find it a good and advantageous match for us both. Our family name will not be sullied by marriage to a Turk collaborator. A toast... to my sister, Christina Kanelos, whose defiance in death keeps our dream of freedom alive. May her spirit live on through her sons, Demetri and Vangeli, and in my beloved daughter, Anna Christina. Yamas. Yamas Best not mention your rebellious relatives too loudly lest the Turks consider it an act of treason. Even I, in my position, cannot help you. You can no more help me "in your position" than you could be of any use to my daughter except to shame her. He's not good enough for you. Then am I not to marry? You will one day, Anna-mou, but not to a traitor like that. Not at any price. You are destined for greater things. Get your uncle a chair. Yes. Where's my boys? My men? Here, Baba. My young men. Anna Christina. Come sit by your Yia Yia. I know it's a blessing not having to marry Christo, but another suitor unsuited to the honour of our family's name. Of my name. And sometimes I fear that I'll never be allowed to marry. Why do you say that, child? Each time I hear them toast and honour Aunt Christina I feel the burden of her name. She was so strong. I was just... scared. And then that man... You were only eight years old, paidaki-mou. Imagination heals our memories in the shadow of tragedy. Do not let them mislead you. It was not my imagination. The Turk spared me. I live because of him. Listen to your baba. There is no such thing as a good Turk unless he is dead. He must not have seen you, child. I know what I saw. Even if that were true, a compassionate Turk would not have lasted long in the Ottoman Empire. I don't see why you insist on believing it. Then tell me what you do see, Yia Yia. What's in my future? Will I fall in love and marry a good man? Maybe even one of my own choosing? It says you will belong to a greater family than ours, one day. And... you will fall for a great warrior who fights for Greece. A soldier, then. From a prosperous family. But is there something wrong with that? Will I be a widow? True love requires great sacrifice. I only see what the grinds tell me. The rest is up to destiny and to you. Clear the way! Boys, stay with your mother. Demetri, Vangeli, we should arm ourselves. I said clear the way! Please don't. You're scaring the sheep! Control your flock! Is this a gathering for the Friendly Society? Back up, now! Does Kolokotronis use children to fight his revolution? Stand down, now! What is happening here? They raise their rebels young, Colonel. But I will pluck this sprout before it grows to weed. Janissary, take the boy! No! No! Our purpose here does not involve the torture of children. Age does not define an enemy. Blood must flow or they will not learn! Stand down, Captain. We have more pressing issues. Indeed we have. Hyah! Alexi, come here. Baba! Go, go. Let's go. No, wait, Baba. Spread out. Bring me that tinker! Check all the houses! Spread out. He can't have gone far. Is it just coincidence that we meet him in Tripolitsa and now here again in Valtetsi? If I were a suspicious man... I might think he followed us here. I followed no one. And I mean no offence. I sell and trade goods with many. Then why run? I do not deliberately seek out trouble and I find no shame in running from it. Perhaps you do not trade, but aid in the business of your Friendly Society. Your Filiki Eteria. Might you even be Stavros, the spy I seek? I do not know this Stavros. And I have no knowledge of any Friendly Society. Then we will educate you. And you will reciprocate. How can I tell you something I do not know? How can I be someone I am not? I confess! I'm Stavros! I am anyone you wish me to be! Just please stop. You are no Stavros. A true rebel would hold his tongue and die at my hand before confessing. You are not worthy of their Friendly Society. Now go back to your pitiful life and thank the Greek gods for your worthlessness. Take him out and dump him in the street. Slash, like this. That's good. Again. Alexi, come help your sister. Baba says I'm a freedom fighter. We do not tie oregano. I'm going to tell Mama what you... Boys, boys! OK. Go on. Nico, get the other basket. We should go. Yes, Anna-mou. Anna! Anna Christina! It's alright, boys. That's a fine sword you have. My apologies. I mean no harm to you or your children. Savas Ati was drawn to the water. The waters are yours. My brothers and I will take our leave. Look, Anna-mou. Baba says butterflies are our ancestors and they're here to protect us. I was also taught to believe that. Are you a Greek? A conscript? No. I am a Turk. But my tutor, Thanasi, is Greek, and to my great fortune he proved a better teacher than I a student. You will make fast friends if you feed him these. Can we feed the horse? Please? He will not bite. What do you want from us? My men should not have frightened the child as they did. He appears unaffected by the scare. Good Savas Ati. Children can forgive, even when they can't forget. And you? Can you forgive? Why would my forgiveness be of any consequence to you and your men? I ask only for me. Please, I'm grateful for your help in the square, but I put my family in danger and shame myself if I'm seen with you here. Please understand. Boys, we should be on our way. Nico, take my basket. Lexi, don't forget your sword. Sir? Thank you, young one. Protect and care for your sister. Bye. Bye, Savas Ati. Not a word of this to anyone. Shh. I apologise for soiling your fine barn, dear woman. You are not the smelliest animal I have taken into my yard, but the most dangerous, perhaps. You take great risk to hide and care for me. These eyes have seen many things. Turks come into our village with their assassins demanding we honour their sultan. If I knew a true rebel, I would ask him to give an old Greek woman her turn at these Turks. You may indeed get your turn, dear woman. I would be proud to be your blade. I owe you my life. Stavros Valvianos, of the Filiki Eteria. I am honoured to be gifted with your kindness. You will stay put and rest until your new yia yia says differently. So, this tinker you questioned... was he not your elusive rebel, Stavros? CHUCKLING Spies in our midst are no laughing matter. He will taste the blade of your father's dagger soon enough. But you must find him first. A message from Tripolitsa and your horse's laundry. Time to earn those fees you pocket, tax man. Oh, don't feign surprise. The Greek who handles the honey cannot resist licking his fingers. You did well today. Now we eat. Yes, Baba. Then we'll practice. I must return to Tripolitsa at once. Look! The Mustapha Bey calls an urgent council. It's Savas Ati! Oh, it is! The duties of a leader, eh? Hmm. You'd do well to watch that man. I have it on good authority that he travels well beyond where a cheesemaker need journey. Baba, can we feed the horse? No! We go home. Come on, let's go. Perhaps even as far as the Friendly Society. How can we trust his information? If he is willing to stain his hands with the blood of his own countrymen, he will do most anything to gain favour for himself. I have found his information to be as reliable as his greed. Then pay him to gather news on Stavros and Kolokotronis. Until his accusations are proven true, observe the cheesemaker's activities, but do no more until I return. Be patient, Stavros. Patience puts you at greater risk with these Turks in town. I must leave as soon as possible. Patience is a virtue I gained when I lost several of my family to these invaders. Where is your family? They must worry for you. The Filiki Eteria is my family now. They unite us in our loss and bond us through our faith. And if you are ever in need, hang this in your doorway. I'm never far. And I will not forget what you've done for me. Hmm. I am at your mercy, good woman. Even with a weapon, I stand disarmed. I am Tariq. And I am no one you should be talking to. Your precision is impressive. It does not surprise me that the greatest compliment you can give a lady is on how she wields a blade. Where did you learn to cut like this? My mother. Really? She taught me to relax and let the blade find the cut. Must you swing as if the hay were your enemy? Your blade meets with many who are not your enemy, yet you wield it with little compassion. My concern is only with your safety. There is little room for error. There's never room for error as a Greek. But you know this. It is your people who make the rules that my people must live by. There is something about you. Something I haven't seen in a long time. But I cannot recall what it is. I remind a lot of people of the past. It seems to be my curse. I meant no offence. Then why do you treat us with such cruelty? Are we really so different? You and me. Civility is often overlooked when maintaining order. The Empire will do whatever is needed to protect its interests and its people. Must that include the torture and killing of innocents? We do no more to you and yours than you would to us, if given the chance. Greek or Turk, men seek what others have... and will fight to the death to possess it. I do not believe that's the only way. Then you would do well to believe these words. It has been reported that your father is a rebel spy. Wait, what? And a traitor to the Empire. But he's merely a cheesemaker. Wait, who-who would accuse him of such treason? He should limit his travels and stay close to home. At least until my return from Tripolitsa. Tariq. Why do this? Why warn me? Because I once thought I was saving a life by doing nothing, but now... I have come to believe that doing something is a greater service. A-Anna Christina. My name is Anna Christina. Hmm. Hyah! How is it you were so familiar with this Turk that he could tell you this? Have I failed to teach you right from wrong, daughter? And why would he say such things and not tell you who seeded these lies? Every Turk has his game and it is never to our benefit. Baba, someone in the village has betrayed you. I believe Tariq spoke the truth. Tariq. You may know his name and believe his truth, but he's a devious Turk. There is no other kind. That's not true. He's different. He has good in him. Why would you make such a claim? Has he bewitched you? Take that! Because he's the Turk who spared me on the cliffs. No, not this again. Boys, please. When I saw him in the square, I knew it was him. It is him. I'll never forget the kindness in his eyes. Kindness? What kindness did he show driving your aunt Christina, and her newborn to their deaths? Did you speak to him? No. No. No, I don't think he recognised me. I did not answer him. He-He was on his horse, and I... When can we see the man with the horse again? You put your brothers in harm's way as well? What were you thinking? You don't understand. I don't understand how my daughter would act with such careless disregard. If we have caught the attention of the Turkish soldiers, then we are no longer safe here. We must leave Valtetsi. If we leave, it will only confirm their suspicions. Baba... You. Stay away from this Turk... no matter who you think him to be. Do not disobey me. I forbid it. Yes, Baba. The sultan has commanded that we send another 5,000 troops to the north. Troops that we can ill afford to spare from Tripolitsa. As it is, Kolokotronis and his Greek rebels grow bolder. To the point we cannot justify moderation. The council has already sanctioned more severe punishments to compensate for the lack of troops. When Sunal gets wind of this... he will not hesitate to exact reprisals from any Greek he meets. Then you must order him back to Tripolitsa immediately. What could you have possibly done that requires an escort for something you do by yourself all the time? Is this about the man that they say was hidden in Yia Yia's stables? Captain Sunal, sir! Colonel Tariq commands you to return to Tripolitsa immediately. You tell him that until we capture and question the spy... Captain, his orders are immediate. Hyah! Ready the horses. The Turks are leaving! Good riddance. I need a word with you, cheesemaker. How is it you so cleverly disguise your insurrection against the Empire? I don't know what you mean. I've been told that a Vakrinos spies for the Filiki Eteria. Have I been misinformed? Your information is false. I have nothing to hide. I do not know where you get your information, but it is not true. I am a cheesemaker. Nothing more. Constantine... Go back inside, watch over the boys. If not you... then what of this one? Please, I beg of you. Let her go. Is she the spy in your household? Let her go. The boys need their mother. Then tell us what you know, traitor! I know nothing! If you do not wish to watch her die... perhaps you'd prefer to watch her beg for your life. Please! Surely your mother would have wanted better from you. You know nothing of my mother. No! Varvara. Fetch me the tax collector. He will answer for this. Captain, we must leave. Our orders. I, too, protect my brother. Demetri, go check on Yia Yia. Make sure she's safe. Go! Yia Yia, what is it? What has happened? God sees fit to bring more of my family closer to Him... and my heart breaks for it. Oh, God! Sunal, what have you done? Me? How will you account for the Empire's assets lost here today, tax man? Behold your handiwork, Christo. You promised me a spy, but you have yielded me nothing. WHIMPERS He has a daughter and she... she surely knows his secrets. Now you tell me his daughter is a spy? Do you take me for a fool? No. Let's go. No! Mana! Mana? Baba! Baba! Nico! Alexi! No! Stop! Nico! You can't! MUTTERS IN GREEK God help us! Help! Father Almighty... in the name of thy beloved son, our hope, who gave himself for a ransom to death, and we were held fast and continue so to this day. Believing every rumour of Greek rebellion would have us chasing our own tails all over the Peloponnese. We must find the truth of it. What news of Valtetsi? Have the rebels found a foothold there, so close to Tripolitsa? Valtetsi is no threat for the moment. They're too busy mourning a spy and his traitorous family. Did you recapture and kill the tinker? I told you... No! It was the cheesemaker. Were you able to extract any information from this spy? He fought like a bull, yielded nothing. There was no choice but to put him down. An unfortunate turn of events... for his family as well. Were you not given orders to keep them in line until my return? A revolution is upon us. Interrogating spies is of more value to the Empire than simply keeping them in line. And who are you to decide that? Would it not have been better to have kept him alive until he broke? He would not break. But I'm told he has a daughter who still lives. She may be of no consequence, but I have informants seeking her capture. Find the real rebels. Do not waste your time on this, Sunal. Indeed. Chasing after some young girl... is my job. Speaking of which, I'll be in my chambers. You have your orders. May the Ottoman Empire prevail! You disobeyed my direct orders and slaughtered innocent Greeks! Do so again and I will have you removed from your post. Do you punish me for killing a spy? One day, you will remember to see them as I do, my friend. Your mind is clouded by the pipe. He killed an entire family. And now he seeks to hunt down an innocent girl. Sunal is a professional assassin. He performs his duty, however heinous, and shows his allegiance to the Empire. You sound like a Turk, Thanasi. And you a Greek... which is infinitely more dangerous. Now, Tariq... I laud your sensitivities, and you know that. But this open display will be taken as weakness by your peers and even used against you. Then you will be able to help no one. My judgment is sound. Is it? Whatever this girl is to you, I must counsel you to leave her be. No good will come of this. You have a kingdom to protect. Thanasi... I must ask you to do something for me in Valtetsi. As we come together on this darkest of days, in sorrow and in grief, let us pray. Amen. Amen. Your Aunt Christina's scarf gave me comfort when she was returned to the earth, and now I hope that it can do the same for you. Anna. Thank you for your prayers. Anna. My family appreciates it. Anna Christina. Anna Christina, may I offer my sincerest condolences. Please know that my offer of marriage is still yours. With these Turks at hand, the safest place for you is with me. I have resources. I can give you a home and I will be your family. She still has a home and she still has a family. I'm merely making... Walk away. I am merely extending her comfort. Then comfort her by your absence. Keep walking. Constantine! Please. No, no, no! Shh... Alexi. Baba. With these signs, I mark thy passing... and pray they will guide thee... to thy final judgement and eternal rest. Anna Christina? I am unfamiliar with this prayer, this tribute. Is this a local tradition? It's my own prayer. I have learned too well in my life that... friend or foe... the dead must be guided to their rest. Were you a friend of my father's? Alas, no. My name is Thanasi. Where did you get that? Ah. Well, you and your brothers gave this to a mutual friend. Um... It is his wish that it be returned to you. He shares your grief... and asks for a moment of your time. Tell your friend that our friendship died with my family. I am deeply sorry for your loss. Please leave now. It's the only courtesy I can extend. Of course. But... may I? Anna-mou. Leave her be. To Him, we belong, and to Him we shall return. Anna Christina. Why do you desecrate the memory of my family by coming here? This is not the memory of your family. Your memories are warm and full of life. This is no place for you and your grief. Nor is it a place for you, after what you and your men have done. It was my captain, Sunal, that brought this torment upon you. And you cannot control your dogs? It was done on my watch and I carry this disgrace upon my conscience. Then disgrace weighs upon us both. I told my father... that you were good and could be trusted. I did not order this. My intent was to save him and to protect you. Then why? I search my soul for the same answers. Believe me. I did believe. For a dozen years, I believed. Why must you come and bring death into my life again? What? You. You and your men brought death and destruction to the village of Levidi. My aunt, Christina, led the women and children over the cliffs. Have you not brought me and so many others enough unspeakable grief? This... this belonged to my aunt, Christina Kanelos, who died in defiance against the Turks. Against you! Do you remember now? I remember all of it. I am haunted every day by their sacrifice. None of it has left me. And none of what your men have done will leave me, not ever. I will avenge the deaths of my family and see your captain slain for it! Baba was right. The only good Turk is a dead one. Then take your revenge with my own blade. Honour your family and make me a good Turk. I deserve no less for the pain I've caused you. You were right. There's nothing more here. You wear our mother's scarf with grace. You bring honour to our family, Anna-mou. Honour does not comfort me in my loss. When they died, I buried Anna with them. I'm not that girl anymore. I will wear her scarf and fight in her name, as Christina. I understand and feel your grief. It will weigh heavy on your heart for some time. But the pain will become bearable and the wound will heal. I have no desire to heal this wound. This was your godson, Alexi's. Wear it in remembrance of him. And this was Nico's. Wear it in remembrance of him. Remember their innocence in life and in death. Pray for their souls and for mine. For today, I make a vow... to avenge the deaths of our family. Child, you will be avenging no one. I'm not a child, Father. My family's bones lie at the foot of these cliffs and beneath hallowed ground. Have I not earned the right to seek justice for them? To pledge vengeance is a sin. And when the Turks slaughtered my family, was that not a sin in God's eyes? You must follow what is right in your own heart. And I will travel with you. I will go and fight as well. And pray for God's will and protection. Then together, we will find our solace in steel with those who fight against the Turks. They will chase their destinies with the Filiki Eteria. Join those hidden rebels? How will you even find them? I may have a way. Sighs. Patience. Moment. Ah. Stavros. Ah! I knew you would come. I was told you have business that involves killing Turks. Who of you will be coming with me? All three of us. I will tend the flowers in your mother's garden. If it is God's will, as long as they thrive, you will be safe. Get your things. We need to reach the camp before nightfall. I'll miss you, Yia Yia. Mmm. Your father's cross. Stavros, take care of my grandchildren. I will protect them with my life. What is this place? The home of the Salas, and their poor Greek village, until the Turks came and took everything from them. Now it only serves as a-a home for their ghosts. And us. All clear, boys. Welcome back, Stavros. Turks are fair game for your thievery, but never steal from your own people again or else you're no better than a Turk and we will treat you as one! We're in need of volunteers. What did you bring us? My brother and I. We're strong. We can fight. If you come with Stavros, you're more than welcome. But you must go. They slaughtered her family. Her grief is deep, but her anger is deeper. Let her fight. We all grieve from loss. We cannot afford the distraction. You must leave in the morning. She must stay, please. Go. Don't worry, you're not going anywhere. Please, if you doubt her ability, I will fight for the both of us. Tell us what to do. What is the plan? We wait for orders. General Kolokotronis will send word for us any day now. We are sure of it. So, what? There's no plan to fight? The plan, dear boy, is to stay alive until we are ready to strike. What do we do until then? We pack and keep moving. But we just arrived. That's the life of a freedom fighter. Remain vigilant and stay on the move... or death will grab you. He's ready to run at a moment's notice. You, my boy, will be the new camp courier, so this old man can rest his weary legs. He will change his mind about me. We will change his mind about you. Nico? Alexi? Shh! If you desire to stay, here's how you can serve your countrymen. Anna! Anna! Wait! Back! Christina. Wait. This thief got what he deserved. His actions shame us all. Do not doubt me. My blade will taste the blood of anyone who violates my honour, Turk or Greek! With this sign, I mark thee dead... and pray it will take you to your final judgement. Can I be there... when you tell her she still has to leave tomorrow? Christina. Gregory, I don't understand. Why are we still just sneaking around, moving camp from one place to another? At least Demetri's trips back to the village brings us news and supplies. When are we going to fight the Turks? Patience, my boy. We have to keep moving so the Turks cannot find us. We must stay in hiding so we can be ready for when General Kolokotronis gives us orders. Does he even know we exist? The general knows that there are many groups like ours in the mountains awaiting his word. To do what? Fight? Most of our weapons are old farming tools. We could always till the Turks to death. - STAVROS, - Shh! Be quiet. Stay down. See? That is why we avoid engaging with them. We're no match for their firepower. We have a rifle. Against two dozen trained soldiers also with rifles? I think not. Their camp blocks our only passage up. How do we get past them? We move quietly, behind those trees. Stay close to me, Anna-mou. Come on. Alarm! Alarm! Run! Now! Hold them off! There, now! Go! Get down! Baba? For you, Baba. Did you do this? My father guided me. Any Turks alive? No, all the Turks are dead. I've found one alive! Down! With this sign, I mark thee dead. May it carry you to your final judgement. Do you know the Janissary captain, Sunal? Then you will deliver this message to him. I am the daughter of Constantine Vakrinos. By calling me a rebel, he has made me one. I will hunt until it is his blood that I wipe from my blade. Hyah! Open every crate, saddlebag and barrel. Take all that is useful. That cannon, hitch it to one of the horses. Christina. Check the bodies. We won't have to wait for the general to call upon us, after all. Thanks to you, we now have a reason to call upon him. She said what? Well, Captain Sunal, you've made yourself a dangerous enemy. We all know how women can be. The caravan travelled with 20 men and was heavily armed. How is it only you survived? They were no more than 12 men and we engaged them... when she appeared from the mist. She moved through the thick of battle like a ghost. And no harm came to her. The explosion killed most of our men. She marked me as a dead man. She's a sorceress. Bewitched! She is an ordinary girl of no consequence who mocks the feebleminded! Now get out of my sight! Superstition will not be our undoing. Nor will it save these farmers from our retribution. Double the escorts for all transports. This must not happen again. You've made quite an impression on both Greeks and Turks. I'm not trying to impress anybody. And this is why you have. Your cousin does not understand what an asset she is. Word of what she's done has spread to other villages, other camps. And to the Turks as well, no doubt. Yes, but they underestimate us. The Greeks have nothing. Just a few more farmers with weapons. Find us another route through the mountains. Our fighters see in her the essence of what we fight for. Our wives, mothers, daughters. They'll protect her with their lives. And the Turks? I know what they should see. It was Vangeli's idea. And we've sent word to all the other camps. We will leave a common signature. Your signature. It will confound the Turks and make them think that you are everywhere. I've received word that the sultan is sending reinforcements and munitions. So do stop worrying, Colonel Tariq. They said they wanted to join the "camp of Christina." Your legend precedes you. As it always has. Then perhaps you should let it. What do you mean? Christina, you carry these men's hopes and fears through your courage. And in return, they are ready to carry your legend into battle. Honour that. For Christina! She is a sorceress. Five caravans in as many weeks? They dare us to retaliate. That's enough. Now seal it up and bury it. Mark this spot well. We ought to give her a nickname. Something fierce to strike fear in the Turks. She should be the Hand of Vengeance. The Maiden of the Mountains. My name is Christina. That's who I am. That should be enough to make them remember. She's right. Let the Turks know and fear our real names. I'm tired of being told who I am. And who I'm supposed to be. No good can come from being told such a thing. But you've helped all of us figure out who we are. To Christina! Let our hands be your vengeance. Let the Turks know fear when they hear your name. She turns our men into frightened rabbits and she mocks us! How can a peasant girl outwit my soldiers? Find her and kill her. Killing her will only make her a symbol, Your Eminence. Then I will defile that symbol to break their spirit. I will find her, Your Eminence. Deliver the girl unharmed! I will decide her fate. She is in danger. I need to find a way to speak with her. I have no wish to see more Greeks die. But consider the consequences. If you are caught with an enemy of the Empire, and, more importantly, the property of the bey, there may be no redemption for you. If I help her, I risk my life. If I don't, I risk hers. There may be no redemption for me either way, my friend. Please go to Valtetsi and find me a way to reach her. I will do my best. Open the gate! Summon the tax collector. I'm holding him to his promise. How is it you knew my son? My apologies, dear lady, but your son and I were not acquainted. You come to his burial and now to his garden, yet you did not know him. So what is your business here? My name is Thanasi. I am tutor to one who serves the sultan. I've come here to ask your help regarding your granddaughter. And why would I help a Greek... who pledges loyalty to a Turk? Because as Greeks... you and I have seen much over the years. And we both know that changing the course of mighty rivers begins with wayward pebbles catching each other against the current. And my granddaughter is one of these pebbles? She is. My master could be, too... so long as we can find a way to nurture their hopes instead of crushing them. Who was that man, Yia Yia? Does he bring trouble? He does, indeed. But wrapped in promise. You must get a message to Christina for me. I have a message for you. Kolokotronis... calls for a gathering of all the freedom fighter camps in the mountains. We're ready to take the fight to the Turks at last! Yes! Yes! Christina. Yia Yia wishes for a meeting with you at the cenotaph. Do you recall where it is? I thought Aunt Christina's shrine had been lost. No. No. We moved it to a cave in the canyons west of Valtetsi. It's hard to find and it's less travelled. When we move camp I'll escort you there. Yia Yia still burns the kandili oil for your mother. Yes, she does. And your first tribute at her funeral still guards this place. I remember making it. I put all my sorrow and guilt into this. And now it fuels our rebellion. Your mother would want us to... Yia Yia? Christina, stay behind me. We've been betrayed. What have you done to our grandmother? Where is she? She is safe in the village. Without her help, I would not be here. She would never trust a Turk. Christina, this is a trap. Why do you haunt me still? You know this man? He does not trust me. Nor should he. To him, I'm just a Turk. A killer of Greeks. Is that who I have become to you as well? Why are you here? There have been some developments in Tripolitsa. You are not safe. So, your captain, Sunal, has received my message? He has. As did the court of the Mustapha Bey. Sunal rides with his men in search of you. Let him come. My hatred for him is greater than my fear. Do you understand that it is my fear for you that brings me here? The bey has ordered you be brought back alive, for his harem. Come with me, and I can protect you. You'd see me delivered to a man who would enslave me for his pleasure? Please, Christina. You must trust me! She will trust no one. Especially a man who seeks her capture. I seek only her safety. Why? We're enemies. "I do not believe that is the only way." You told me that once. Though Sunal has the blood of both Greek and Turk, he cannot see its value. We can choose better. I did not choose this. He brings this fight to me and I will not run from it. Nor will I be captured and made a slave! You know I cannot go with you. Then at least allow me this. He is one of my fastest. No matter where you release him, he will return to me with your message. I've always wondered why they don't just fly free. There is only one thing he desires more than his freedom. I have his mate. I must go now. The others will worry soon. I worry now. Christina, we can't just let him go. A war weighs upon us both. I look to you to keep her safe. To do so, learn to cock your pistol first. Your father turns in his grave! You have betrayed everything that he died for! He saved my life. He's a good man. How can you put your trust in a Turk? One you barely met. I've known him in my heart for a dozen years. Vangeli... you must trust me. And tell no one, not even Demetri. My captain demands to know where to find the cheesemaker's daughter. Such important information I will impart to Captain Sunal, not his errand boy. Tell me, now! Or shall I tell the captain that you've outlived your usefulness? Her cousin, Demetri, he goes in and out of the woods. He can lead you to her. He's in the church right now. Pray that you are right about this cousin of hers. I'm merely here to pray. How dare you desecrate the Lord. Traitor! Christo! Burn the house down! That traitorous bastard! Christo will pay for this! Forget about the tax man. What about Demetri? The Turks took Demetri to get to us. To get to me. They mean to divide our attention. We must not let them succeed. I am sorry, but it is all we can do for now. But we will think of something. That's not enough! Vangeli. That's not enough. We have to do something. He's been taken to Tripolitsa. So we may have a chance. You would trust a Turk with Demetri's life? He's a good man and he will help us. Rumours place the greatest number of these rebels in Valtetsi, Your Eminence. Then take that village and rid it of those peasants once and for all. I will not tolerate this from a bunch of bandits, farmers and a girl! Again! Have you broken this one yet? Sadly, this "simple shepherd" seems most uninformed as to the rebels' whereabouts. Then throw this garbage back out into the street to serve as a warning. He's the cousin of the girl we seek. He's of greater importance... Greater importance than the preparations for war, Captain? The bey has just given new orders to attack Valtetsi. So we may not know where the rebels are now, but we know where they will be. So waste no more time here. That is my direct command. As you wish, Colonel. Release him. Let me tell you what I will do to you if I see your face again! I apologise for the blows. Your cousin, Christina, sends her regards. I do this for her. Find your friends in the Greek quarter and get out of the city as quickly as you can. Say you were released because you knew nothing. Do you understand? Yes. Now get him out of here! You risk too much. Your father trusted me to teach you the ways of the Greeks so that you could govern wisely, not risk your position by betraying your own people! You taught me that true leaders must stand on the side of what is right. To speak for both Greek and Turk. Should I not be such a leader now? It is a sacrifice I'm willing to make. I need you to see that that man leaves the city safely. See to it that this man gains a shadow. Yes, sir. God truly smiles on your brother, Vangeli. It seems we have friends in high places. A Greek supporter in the palace, no doubt. I'd like to meet our friend from Tripolitsa, shake his hand. So would I. But he's not safe yet. It's a certainty that the Turks will try and follow him to locate us. But this time, we will be ready for them. It seems you were right about your good Turk. Demetri. Come here. Demetri. What have they done to you? I'm alright. Yia Yia, what are you doing here? I insisted on seeing for myself how my grandchildren are living in rebellion. And I could not get her to stop pestering me about seeing you. With an imminent attack on Valtetsi, she's safer here. Thank you. I counted at least three or four Turks trailing us on horseback just around that bend. Then let us welcome them. We attack on my signal. Demetri, get Yia Yia to safety. We must tell Captain Sunal. Attack! Come on! Vangeli, take some men, check the road. Christina, stay here and be vigilant. There may be more in the surrounding forest. Come here, with me. Why? Oh, God. Why did you come here? Why did he send you? He does not know I came. Nor that the wagon was followed. But why, Thanasi? How could this have happened? And by my hand. Please, Anna... Listen. You must listen. The closer you draw Tariq to you, the tighter the noose draws around his neck. I-I will die, but if he dies... If his own people believe him a traitor... then the best hope for our people dies with him. Promise me... you will not turn him from his destiny. Promise. Wait, wait, wait. The woods are clear. Who is he? This mark says he worked for the Turks. He's a Greek. I knew him. He deserves our respect. He may be a Greek, Christina, but he's a traitor and deserves no respect. If he is one who helped free Demetri, then he deserves our utmost respect. We will not let this treachery go unanswered. We must send a message. And so must I. Halt! Who goes there? The Filiki Eteria returns what belongs to the Empire. And tell Captain Sunal that Stavros returns his Janissaries. Hyah! Stop that horse! No. This was not the sacrifice I meant, old friend. I am sorry for the loss of your mentor. But this terrible act only shows how the Greeks treat even their own. They cannot be trusted. They are not who you want them to be, my brother. My heart breaks to see you learn this lesson in blood. But their retribution is coming. The rebels have no doubt learned our plan and Kolokotronis will be preparing to resist. Then he's a fool. We have more than four times his men and ten times his firepower. We've sent a generous demand for his surrender. But if it's a battle they want at Valtetsi, we shall crush them. And Tariq will have a chance to avenge his teacher. Let's leave him to his sorrow. We have much to prepare. Christina. It's not your fault. He knew the risk and is now closer to God for it. What concerns me is your Turk. Are you sure you can trust him? There can be no room for doubt. As children of God... have we no room for faith? The Turks are capable of anything. Do you truly have faith that he is the man you hope him to be? After what I've done, I do not know. Demetri, Christina. The time has come to face the Turks. We now have thousands of freedom fighters amassed near Valtetsi. Tomorrow, we prepare for battle. Demetri, they will need our knowledge of the village and of the surrounding hills. Come. More battles, more death. As it is, how do I seek forgiveness for the innocent life I've taken? Perhaps you will find peace in a night of prayer at the cenotaph. Will you come with me? Chasing destiny is for the young, my child. Let Demetri escort you. I only wish to go home. I have a growing garden to tend. The bey has generously allowed you a day to mourn, my brother. We'll meet at the field camp tomorrow and there we will crush these rebels and bring glory to the Empire. Hyah! Hyah. Hyah! You are not my God. But you were his. And I pray you will carry him to his eternal rest. I'll make a campfire and keep watch. God have mercy on my soul. I am lost and seek your guidance. I've betrayed my family and dishonoured them... by trusting a man I should not have trusted... and that I've come to love. I've tried to hate him, to rid him from my heart... but the thought of him will not leave me. And now to have the blood of an innocent he loved on my hands is more than I can bear. Please, I pray for the strength to honour my family, to help my people, to find a way to... to live with myself for loving him. Why are you here? Have you come to avenge the murder of one you loved? For I am guilty and ashamed of what I've done. All I see before me is a mirror of my own torment and grief, whose guilt and shame is no less haunting. I've come to love you, Christina, more than my own life. You must go now. My honour is all I have left. And my love for you. Christina! There's a Turkish horse out back in... Thank you, Demetri, for your discretion. And what will you do if they won't listen? What are we to do? I beg you, Christina, leave these lands and you can be safe. Your presence here puts your family in peril. I can arrange for you to travel far from the Empire and the endless fighting. I have such influence. Then you must use that influence to help stop this bloodshed. You're an honourable Turk. If you believe peace is possible, you must fight to find it. You speak to me as Thanasi once did. A Greek who believed that my people could learn and change. But my belief grows weaker each day. They no longer listen to my reason or guidance. They see force as the only way to rule. Then what sway could I possibly have over my people? You underestimate who you are to your people, and to me, Christina. There is a battle coming to Valtetsi. I beg you, stay clear of it. I cannot bear to lose you. Nor could the Greek people. If I'm to do this... I need you to swear to protect and take care of my remaining family. You have my word. Upon my honour, I swear to you. Gregory, they're back. Good. The Turks have come to fight. Did all of Tripolitsa move here? There are thousands of them. We cannot engage such a force and survive. We will use the terrain to even the fight. Stavros is right. We know these lands better than any Turk. There are only two paths to attack the village. Their main force will make a frontal assault on Valtetsi. We've been tasked with defending the rear path to the village near the hills where they seek to cut off all escape. It's time for us to win. Ah, welcome back, Colonel. At last, the Greeks send their reply to our generous offer of their surrender. I will read their cowering acceptance. Then we can leave these filthy peasants to their farms. We attack at dawn and we will show no mercy. Your Eminence, the Valtetsi tax collector urgently requests an audience. Your Eminence... I've learned first-hand that an official from your court has been consorting with the traitorous girl whom you seek for your harem. You're sure of this, Greek? I have no doubt. The colonel is a traitor. Their clandestine meetings would've remained undetected if it were not for my vigilance. Now I, Christo Petrakis, have proven my loyalty to the Empire and to you. I've heard enough of your lies, tax man. Are you foolish enough to accuse the man most trusted by the sultan? You? A thief who steals the Empire's taxes? Your loyalty to this court will be rewarded accordingly. Captain Sunal, I would like you to show him our most precious metal. No. No, no. Oh, no, no. No! No! I-I know-I know things! I am loyal to the sultan. I know things! Why would I lie to you? Why would I lie? My information is always sound! Colonel Tariq is consorting with the enemy. He's betraying the Empire! I know. But no one else will. An Ottoman colonel... conspiring with the rebels? Ridiculous. I'm sick of these Greeks and their lies. And I want this girl dead and on display. Like all dissidents of the Empire. Bestow this honour upon your colonel to avenge the death of Thanasi. A Greek for a Greek, my brother. The honour is yours alone, Colonel. You will bring me her head. There is no honour in a Greek who feigns being Turk. Greek blood runs through your veins and yet I can honour you! And I've returned that honour by protecting you and your family against all threats. But sometimes... sometimes the most dangerous ones do not carry swords. I promise you, I'm willing to perform your duties in this matter to save you from yourself. Would that someone would do the same for me, but my mother's shame and that Greek rapist's blood allow me no salvation. I only aim to honour you and your destiny as the true Turk I can never be. So do not stand between my sword and her neck. Christina! Christina, come see! General Kolokotronis marches with his troops and rallies the people! We have a leader for our revolution. Yes! Maniotes of Spartan blood. Mariners from Spetses. Even more of the Europeans have joined our cause. Look at all the camps. God is surely with us. Christina. The general, he's here. In our camp. It's Kolokotronis. It's Kolokotronis. He's here. In our camp. It's Kolokotronis. So... you are the daughter of Greece that frightens and confounds the Turks. It is an honour to meet you at last. It is said that the strongest weapons are not made of lead and steel, but of love and hope. What you carry in your heart... can rule nations. And we will need your inspiration for the long war to come! These are the words of Bishop Germanos to be read in every camp... by a true Greek patriot. "They have taken that for which we were best known to the peoples of the world. They have murdered the equality and freedom which we invented with democracy. For 400 years these Turks tortured and killed us along with our ideals which benefit all mankind. And we accept it, having been born with it. They've taken our numbers from 20 million to 1 million. It is time each man, woman and child be willing to sacrifice their life if necessary." Yes! "Because there will never be enough of us to attempt this again." That's right. "And if these Turks kill what little remains, history will write that we were free again..." Yes! "Before disappearing from God's earth." She's right. Christina! Christina! Together we fight from these hills and cliffs for our freedom! Freedom! Or death! Freedom! Freedom or death! Freedom or death! Freedom or death! Freedom or death! We must lead with our fiercest fighter. Sunal, you will lead the forces against Valtetsi's rear flank. And, Tariq, you will defend the bey here and lead the secondary reinforcements. I will command the main frontal assault tomorrow. May the Empire prevail. Move out! Stay vigilant. So you've finally grown some balls and joined up, eh, tinker? Well, you've been coming at me for years to no avail. I thought it time I came at you. My friends call me Stavros. If you thought to come at me alone, you should've stayed in hiding. We can no longer hide that which is everywhere. Send to Tariq for reinforcements. This will be a long but satisfying day. Advance! Secure that alley! Flank to the right! Aim for the hill! Aim for the rooftops! Focus on the rooftops! Hyah! Hyah! Whoa, whoa! Hyah. Stand your ground! Vangeli! Christina! Stay down! Cover me! Christina! Janissary! Vangeli, no! Demetri! Watch your flank! Hyah! Cannon fire! Christina. Hyah! Vangeli! No. Oh, God. No, no, no, no. You! Argh! I will keep my promise to you! I will not fight you! You filthy Turks killed my brother! What sorcery have you now, little girl? You destroyed my family, you monster! And you... You! You are no less a monster for what you have done to my brother. Christina! You have twisted his heart and mind. He was born to lead. And you turned him from his destiny. Now bare your throat and die as your mother did. With this sign, I mark thee dead. May it carry you to your final judgement and eternal rest. As a Greek! Christina! Christina! Christina! She's a sorceress. She killed our captain! She killed their captain! Demetri! You must get Christina to higher ground away from the battle! Why should I trust you? Help the colonel. I've got this one. Yes, sir. Because I am trusting you. Now go! Clear a path. She's mine! Christina! Christina! Christina, we must go. Come on! Help the colonel avenge the captain's death. Yes, sir! Come on! Quickly! Come on. (BOTH PANTING HEAVILY Christina, come on! Demetri. Christina. We have to go! Fire! Demetri! Christina! Go back the other way. You must get away from here. The Janissaries are coming. There's nowhere to go. It cannot end like this. If I am to die... then I wish it to be by your hand. I cannot do that. I cannot lose you. Come with me and we will fight our way to freedom. We will get far away from here where we can be together and leave all this madness behind. I will not be the reason you turn your back on your destiny. You are my destiny now. If we die, then we do so fighting. Together. They're overrunning us! Stavros! Shoot anyone who resists! I cannot abandon my destiny any more than you can yours. Christina. Stavros. Freedom or death. Christina! Christina, no! Just as you once gave me my life, sparing me on those cliffs, I now give you yours. Live it boldly and honourably for both of us. Christina, please. And remember your promise... to look after all of us. No. She chose her own destiny! And so shall we! She's the spirit of Greece! We shall never surrender! Oh, Christina. He is the man you hoped him to be. Many died that day. But Valtetsi was saved and the war for Greek independence had begun in earnest. Like that of her aunt, Christina's sacrifice inspired the Greeks to rise up against Turkish oppression. But she also inspired a Turk to do the same. Tariq kept his word and supported Greek independence as a way to peace. But when his moderate voice could not sway the sultan... This is unacceptable. He saw the Europeans enter the war, forcing a peace from the Ottomans that set Greece free. Through it all, he carried her scarf close as a reminder of their love and belief in each other. And before he joined her at last in legend, he returned it to her family with its honours and sacrifices forever woven into its threads. That was Anna Christina's story... and my story. The story of our family. And now, it is yours. Tell me more, Pappou Demetri. Some tales that are told are not always what was but what we wish them to be. But sometimes... they are simply the truth. We are the proof that their actions have not been in vain. Remember this and carry it close, for as we remember our history, our memories watch over us. ♪ I'll Wait For You ♪ ♪ You came into my life ♪ When I was lost and alone ♪ I live because of you ♪ Your gaze ♪ After all those years ♪ Filled my broken heart ♪ And kept away my fears ♪ I'll wait for you ♪ When all the darkness fades ♪ We will be joined ♪ In a timeless embrace ♪ Free from heartache and pain ♪ When love ♪ Far away ♪ To where the souls await ♪ I'm with you ♪ Though you cannot see me ♪ I'm the butterfly ♪ Fluttering through the breeze ♪ Remember ♪ You are a part of me ♪ Though my destiny on Earth ♪ Is a memory ♪ I'll wait for you ♪ When all the darkness fades ♪ We will be joined ♪ In a timeless embrace ♪ Free from heartache and pain ♪ My love ♪ Far away ♪ To where the souls await ♪ I'll wait for you ♪ When all the darkness fades ♪ We will be joined ♪ In a timeless embrace ♪ Free from heartache and pain ♪ My love ♪ Far away ♪ To where the souls ♪ Await ♪ Oooh ooh ooh oooh ooh ooh ♪ Oooh ooh ooh ooh ♪ I'll wait ♪ For you ♪
