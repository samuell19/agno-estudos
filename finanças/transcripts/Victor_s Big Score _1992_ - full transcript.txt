(mellow music) (energetic music) (thunder rumbling) (tense music) * My Boston Rose * My Boston Rose * Everyone knows * Everyone knows * How sweet your blossoms blooming by the Charles * * Blooming by the Charles * And if your petals fade and wither * * Our love will last forever * I'll always be your beau * My Boston Rose * My Boston Rose (scissors snipping) Trim your sideburn? No. (Victor chuckles) (scissors snipping) (man groans) You cut his ear, you cut my husband's ear! Why don't you watch what you're doing instead of trying to pick up women? [Victor] I'm not. I mean, what woman would want you anyway? A barber with no looks and no money. Forget it Romeo, you're a loser. (car engines rumbling) (door latches) (scissors snipping) (jazzy music) (Victor gasps) Vic baby, I like your style. Don (chuckles)! When did they let you out? Oh, just yesterday. See you haven't lost your touch. [Vic] Oh. Hey, come on over later for a few beers. I'm stayin' at my mother's. I don't think so. I'm gonna go check out this new singles joint. I hear that it is loaded with women. (lively music) (patrons chattering) (woman laughing) (Don laughing) (phone ringing) (lively music) [Don] Vic baby! Yeah, hi Don, is it okay if I still come over tonight? (dart thuds) [Don] Sure, but give me an hour. (dogs barking) (woman squeals) (Don laughing) (dog howling) (dogs barking) (crickets chirping) (gentle music) [Vic] Hi, Don. Hi, Vic. Hey, we gotta keep quiet, my mother's asleep. (gentle music) (dogs barking) Want a burger? No. Yeah, I can't stay long. I have to get up early. My landlord kicked me out this morning. What are you doing? Takin' the meat out. So, tell me about that great singles bar, Vic. You struck out didn't you? Hey, just look at my scrapbook. (gentle music) (dogs barking) You know, Don, you shouldn't wear red, it makes you look almost like the devil. Almost Vic, almost? (chuckles) Victor, I am the devil. (chuckles) Since when does the devil live with his mother? (Don groans) [Don] So, why'd your landlady toss ya out? Eh, same thing as last time. Money. Victor my boy, I'm afraid you're gonna be poor all of your life. Why? 'Cause you have no plans. Oh yeah, I suppose you do? You bet your ass I do. Okay, what are your plans? Contests. Life is one big contest. I've entered 71 of 'em so far this year. I figure it's law of averages. Sooner or later ya gotta win. You know, there's probably still hope for you, Victor. I figure you gotta find yourself a rich broad. Forget the romance, it doesn't last. The only thing that lasts is the money. (dogs barking) (gentle music) (pal thuds) (dogs barking) (gentle music) (engine rumbling) Yes, the room's still available and it's only a block from Quincy Adams' grave. (playful music) (birds chirping) You're not a smoker, are you? [Vic] No. (gentle music) Wonderful! I'm Thelma Marshal, won't you come in? Okay (chuckles). (door latches) I'm Victor Hertz. This certainly looks like a nice neighborhood. Well it's not. (Victor chuckles) Let me show you the room. You know, sometimes it gets darned lonesome. You're not a smoker, are you? So here you can see Mamarte and all the little French cafes. It takes me back a long time. Well, what do you think? I'm asking $35 and not a penny less, but you can have it for 24. Oh, in that case- But first let me tell you the rules. No smoking, no girls in the house and no telephoning after 10 p.m. If you can observe these rules, I'll rent you the room tomorrow. Hm, what about tonight? I never do any business on Friday, young man. It's bad luck. Well, the rules are fine, but where will I sleep tonight? Well you can sleep on the couch and when you've been here a month, I'll have a key made for you. It's Lincoln (chuckles). Oh, is it? Oh. If you're the gentleman I think you are, I'll stay up and have a drink with you one night, but no getting any ideas. I'm very old-fashioned in some ways, you know. I better unload the car (chuckles). For one thing, I don't agree with pre-marital relations, not unless the couple is engaged. I'll unload the car? All right, and I'll fix the couch for you. (crickets chirping) Victor? Victor? (gentle music) Do you think I could pass for 60 or 65? Yeah (chuckles), why not? Oh, oh thank you, Victor. I'm nearly 74. (gentle music) Victor, I do hope I can relax around you. I always dress like this at night. Would you like another drink? Well, I'm kind of tired. Maybe another time. Okay, maybe one more (chuckles)? (gentle music) (crickets chirping) (upbeat music) Did you find out how much money she has? No, not yet, no. Maybe we should try someplace else, you know? I never have any luck around here. [Don] Hello, cutie pie! You're cute. Well, come on over and I'll buy you a drink. [Woman] All right. (upbeat music) He's a little on the shy side, you know? Mm hm. Victor? (upbeat music) (patrons chattering) Mm hm. What are you waiting for? (upbeat music) (woman giggling) What are you doing? I'm just trying to think of somethin' to say. Victor, nothing is sadder than a witty jerk. Just buy her a drink. (upbeat music) (woman giggling) (bottle clinking) (upbeat music) (woman giggling) (patrons chattering) (upbeat music) (gentle music) [Thelma] Will you have some more coffee, Victor? No thanks. Oh, aren't you going to be late for work this morning? No, I'm off today. I have to go into the bank. Which bank? [Victor] First National. Oh, that's a good one. That's one of my banks. Banks? Oh heavens, Victor! You don't think I'd trust just one bank with $225,000 do you? You have $225,000? Hm, and the house and a few bonds that I've forgotten all about, but it's gonna last me until I die. Thelma, maybe you can help me. I was gonna surprise you but I'm gonna buy a new car and I'd like to borrow the money from you and it only costs $4,000. Oh, I'm sorry Victor but it might spoil our friendship. You know what they say about lending money to a friend. Yeah, but I thought that I was a special friend. So you are and I've got a nice surprise for you. [Victor] A surprise? I made you a key! (key thuds) (clock ticking) (Victor chuckles) Thanks, I don't want it. Why not? (plate clinks) (Victor sighs) Because I'm moving out. (clock ticking) (playful music) Thelma? (pensive music) (rotary dial spinning) Excuse me, could you tell me how Thelma Marshal is? [Nurse] Someone will be right with you. [Woman] Dr. Forest, please dial 118. [Betty] Are you with Mrs. Marshal? Excuse me, are you with Thelma Marshal? (gentle music) Yeah. Well she's going to be all right. She must mean a lot to you. You'll never know how much. (Betty chuckles) [Betty] What's your name? Victor. Hello Victor, I'm Betty. (gentle music) Look, there's nothing you can do here. (engine rumbling) It's sweet of you to drive me home. Oh, that's all right. We both had a long day. (car rattling) What's wrong with your car? It's not mine. It belongs to a friend. Oh. You know, your landlady is lucky you were there when she passed out. She might have died. You mean that I saved her life? [Betty] That's what the doctor said. Huh, how about that (chuckles). If it had been anyone else other than Thelma I probably woulda gotten a reward. Just be glad you could help, Victor. It's not every day we can save someone's life. I thought you were compassionate. I am, I'm very passionate (chuckling). Uh... Will you go out with me tomorrow night? Would you go to church with me on Sunday? Agreed. And stop worrying about your landlady. She'll be home in no time. (gentle music) I'm sorry that I got angry with you, but it was a good thing I was there to save your life, huh? Thank you, Victor, and now I'm going to do something nice for you. Oh no, you don't have to do anything nice for me, I'm just glad that you're comin' home. What are you, what are you gonna do for me? Well, from now on Victor, you'll need not pay any rent, and you can stay in my house as long as you want. That's not what I want. [Thelma] Well, what do you want, Victor? Cash (chuckles). Oh, now I couldn't do that. Now, you do you realize that I did save your life? $20? You know, if I hadn't called that ambulance you'd probably be dead right now. [Thelma] How much? $4,000. Oh, Victor, why don't you take the free rent? (engine rumbling) (clock ticking) $100. Where are you going? I'm leaving. (clock ticking) (Victor sighs) You'll fix everything in the house that wants fixing? (gentle music) Yeah. [Thelma] You'll be in by 10 p.m. every night? Uh huh. [Thelma] And you'll pay me back $100 a month, plus the rent? You got a deal, sweetie. (upbeat music) (Victor humming) Oh, oh stop it! You're making dizzy. Do you wanna kill me so you don't have to pay the money back? If Don calls tell him I got the car. Thelma, I love you! (upbeat music) (water splashing) (car engine revving) (birds chirping) It's a score, Vic. Not the big time yet, but it's a score. You know, if we do this right, we can make out real good. [Victor] Do what right? You get her to make out a will leaving everything to you. Uh huh, and then what, we kill her? No, we don't kill her. We just make sure she gets the flu or somethin'. That's nice, and you want? [Don] 25%. Oh, yeah. Well, I think that has possibilities, Don, but I would like to name the percentage and I think it should be 10%. [Don] Okay, I'm not greedy. (gong chimes) (Chinese music) Do you need a fishing license for your car? Not unless you wanna fish (chuckles). But it's red and it's got propellors and it, you have to make sure the doors are closed. It's a beautiful car, Victor, but wasn't that generous of Thelma, lending you all of that money? Yeah, well some people are like that. Besides, she's probably grateful for me savin' her life and all, you know (chuckles). (gentle music) Isn't this lovely, Victor? It's so, Chinese. Yeah, even the customers. (gentle music) So, what do religious girls do? We're just like other girls. We like to walk on the beach, we like to go for picnics and we like to screw. (ketchup squirting) (playful music) (Victor chuckles) I didn't mean to shock you. It's just that some fellows get the wrong idea when they find out you're religious. Sorry. I just didn't want you to lose interest, that's all. See, I was married once and I got used to sex and I enjoy it. I'm a good Christian but I can't hide my feelings. Does that make sense? Yeah, sure. Not only that, it gives you a good reason to go to church. Victor, that's not a finger bowl. (liquid bubbling) Ow, ow, ow! (dramatic music) Ow! Ouch. Okay. (dramatic music) (woman screaming) (bag thuds) (woman screams) (bag thuds) (woman screams) (Victor chuckles) (gentle music) (Victor chuckles) (gentle music) Are we ready? (Victor's throat clears) Yeah. (gentle music) (gong chimes) (crickets chirping) Victor, you mean you're just gonna sit around and wait for that poor old woman to die? Is money really that important to you? No, not to me but it is to everybody else. They won't do anything for me unless I give them money. You don't have to give me any money. You know, I like you Betty. (gentle music) (crickets chirping) I like you a lot. (Betty laughing) Great, that's a hell of a response. That's just great. I'm sorry, it was the ketchup. I heard you and I'm glad. (gentle music) (crickets chirping) You know, you're not supposed to put ketchup on Chinese food. (gentle music) (crickets chirping) I want my money back! I want my money back! You haven't kept your promise and I want my money back! Who have you murdered? Thelma, it's late. I have to get up early tomorrow. We'll talk about it tomorrow okay? But tomorrow's Sunday. Why do you have to get up so early? Because I am going to church. Well, that's not good enough! I want my money back! * We sing now together our song of Thanksgiving * * Rejoicing in goods which the ages have wrought * * For life that enfolds us and helps and heals and holds us * * And leads beyond the goals which our fathers once sought * (organ music) (congregation chattering) Now that wasn't so bad, was it? No, I liked the nice sermon. Hello, partner. Well, if it isn't the alcoholic extortionist. What are you doing here? I hear it's a great place to meet rich widows. Who's the lovely lady? You've been hiding things from me, Vic. This is Virginia, she's from Colorado. She's on vacation, she'll be going back tomorrow. You're still married, right? What are you doing here? Oh, it's part of your probation. Uh uh. He's a great kidder. What is your name? Betty. Oh, Betty. Hello, how are you? I'm proud of you, Vic. Hey, when are you gonna fix me up with some of that action you owe me? You fix me up with that one, and I'll wipe the slate clean. - That one is off limits. Believe it or not, I love her. Okay, okay. What about the will, are you workin' on it? Yeah. For a change I think you got a good idea. Take care of Victor for me Betty, or Virginia or whatever. (birds chirping) (congregation chattering) Do you and your friend always put each other down like that? We were just kidding. Besides, I didn't want him to know that were a nurse, we'd never get rid of him. Why not? Well, he's got this weird disease. (Betty giggles) He's always lookin' for medical advice, especially if it's free (chuckles). He likes nurses. His fourth wife was a nurse. (Victor chuckles) (Betty chuckles) (playful music) Who's that? She's with me, we're friends of Victor's, we met in church. Oh. Well, we have to be going now. It's been awfully nice meeting you, Ma'am. (birds chirping) I want my money back. You haven't kept your word. You were out half the night and you haven't fixed anything in the house that I asked you to. - Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh. I fixed the fan. Oh, it doesn't blow anymore, it sucks. Besides which, everybody steals from me. I can't trust anyone anymore, even the mailman doesn't bring me any mail. Don't talk like that. We'll just, we'll go for a ride in the new car, I'll take you to Chinese food, we'll go out for dinner. Oh, you mean you'll take me out on a date? Sure. Oh, that would be lovely! Oh, I would like to go on a date! And we can get Chinese food? [Victor] Don't worry, Thelma. (birds chirping) Nobody is taking anything from anybody. (engine rumbling) Oh, thank you for a wonderful dinner, sweetie. Well, it was my pleasure. Of course, it wasn't a real date. Yeah, what do you mean? Well, if it had been a real date you'd have taken me somewhere to get into my- (cars horn honking) (tires screeching) [Man] You idiot! Are you all right? Uh, yeah. Victor, do you like a hot number? Huh? Well, that's what my husband Charley used to call it, a hot number. You mean... Yes, but we've got to wait until we get home. (horn honking) (tires screeching) I certainly enjoyed dinner. [Victor] So, we're still friends? [Thelma] Of course we are. Victor, would you like me to change into something more comfortable? I mean like they do after "The Late Show?" (Victor chuckles) No, I would like to talk to you. You said that you were alone, do you have any relatives? Well, I've got one niece living in Texas but I haven't seen her for years. Is she the one who gets the money? What do you mean, what money? When you die. Is she on the will? Oh, I haven't made any will. I'm not going to die, not yet, anyway. I go after my mother. She lived to be nearly 100. Poor dear, she wanted so badly to reach 100. What happened to her, a heart attack? No, a truck. Oh, that's too bad. So, you see there's no will. I'll worry about that when I'm 98. Mm hm. What about your niece, is she poor like me? My niece, Lucy? Oh no, she owns an oil well and a rich husband. That's great. Why don't you make out a will, and leave all of your money to me? But what about my niece? She's loaded and besides, she didn't save your life, did she? Well Victor, I think you've got a good idea. If you'll pay for it, I'll do it. Agreed, money is no object (chuckles). We'll do it tomorrow, if you'll do something for me tonight. (gentle music) (birds chirping) [Victor] Now, you're sure you understand right? Of course I do Victor. Which hat shall I wear? [Victor] What are you gonna tell your lawyers? That you're an old friend and that I've known you for years. And that I saved your life. Why do I have to say all these things Victor? Because Thelma, lawyers are dumb and they only know what you tell them. (phone ringing) (tense music) [Man] Your call, Madam. [Lucy] Hello, Aunt Thelma! Lucy! Well, how's Houston? You're not! You are? Well, that's wonderful! Yes, yes I'll be here. Okay, darling. Bye! Oh, Victor guess what? Lucy's in town, she's coming over? Okay, just don't mention the will. That'll be our little secret. Anything you say Victor, but we can't go for the will just now, because guess what? Lucy's in town and she's coming over! Okay, just don't mention the will. Oh, and there's one other thing you can do for me. Well, what's that? Write me a love letter, okay? Oh, Victor, you're so romantic. Hm. "Dear Victor, I've been laying on the couch fantasizing about you. What I really need is your young, hard body, to do the job. Your hot-blooded whore, Thelma." I'm not a whore! Of course you're not but that's the way that lovers talk to each other these days. Oh, it's no wonder the young people are so mixed up. They don't know how to sweet talk. But why do you want me to write a dirty letter? Okay, just write whatever you want. Oh. (clock ticking) (letter rustling) (Victor spits) (door bell chiming) (Thelma sighs) Lucy! Aunt Thelma, darling! (Lucy smooching) Oh, how nice. You have a servant. Oh no, that's Victor. He's my roomer. [Lucy] A roomer? You mean you spent all your money and now you have to take in roomers? Oh, of course not. You know how your aunt watches her pennies. Aunt Thelma please, must we talk in front of him? [Victor] That's all right. Thelma, I'm gonna give you gals some privacy. I'm just gonna sit out on the porch. (playful music) I was on my way to New York and got your letter that you were in the hospital, and I just had to stop and see my favorite aunt. Your only aunt. (playful music) (birds chirping) Aunt Thelma, I brought you a present all the way from Paris. What? Oh, what is it? Why it's a wig, silly. It cost me a fortune but I don't mind. It'll make you look 10 years younger. And before I forget, I wanna talk to you about making a will. Oh no, I couldn't do that. Victor said I wasn't to discuss it with anyone. Is is that man in your will? Yes, of course. He's paying for it. Oh, he is, is he? And how long have you known him? Hm, about a month. And how well do you know this Victor? Well, to tell you the truth, he's my boyfriend. [Lucy] You mean? Yes, isn't it wonderful? (dramatic music) [Lucy] So, you're Victor, the degenerate barber that's sleeping with my 73-year-old aunt. And you're Lucy, the fat asshole from Texas. You listen to me Mister, she's my blood relative. She owes me and no third-rate Casanova is gonna take money that belongs to Lucy Hawthorne. Now, I don't have time to argue. Clear out and I'll give you 5,000 cash. (Victor chuckles) You can't buy me. All right, I'll go as high as 10,000. I'll take it. [Lucy] Good, I thought so. I'll be here tomorrow at noon with the money, you be ready with your car packed. Agreed. Good day, Victor. (dramatic music) (crickets chirping) (Victor imitates bird calling) [Victor] Betty! (crickets chirping) (stone clinking) (gentle music) Victor? What is it? What's wrong? Sorry to bother you tonight, but I have to make a big decision tomorrow and I need to know something tonight. (gentle music) (crickets chirping) Oh, here. Here you go. Know what? (Victor exhales) If it were possible, would you marry me? I mean you know, if it were possible? Victor, are you proposing? No, I can't propose, not tonight. But if it were possible, would you marry me if I was poor? And I am. Victor, this is awfully sudden, but I'll think about it. (gentle music) (crickets chirping) Victor, aren't you going to do something? Do what? Victor, if you're having fun with me- No, no. I can't ask until tomorrow. And what happens tomorrow? I think I'm gonna get $10,000. Victor, you can't do it. I can't do what? I don't know, but whatever it is, it's illegal and you'll go to jail. Oh, it's not illegal, it's just a bribe. Victor, do you know how dumb that sounds? No, it's the truth and it's legal. I just, I had to ask you to marry me first. I needed to know that you'd have me poor. (gentle music) Poor Victor. (horn honking) (jazzy music) [Victor] You son of a bitch! Victor baby, take a look at this window! Boy, you'd be amazed what you see up here on the roof (chuckles). You are really somethin'. Everybody is workin' this morning, and you're up here, you're lookin' for action. Wow! Yeah, that's one couple that's workin' overtime, huh? Hey Vic, look what they're doin' now! Yeah. (Don chuckles) Don? Look, I gotta talk to you about somethin', it's important. [Don] Important? Okay, I'll meet you this afternoon. (Victor sighs) So, that's it. Fat Lucy would tear that phony will apart, so we're gonna have to settle for 10 grand. There's another way, Vic. Sure, marry the old broad. Victor baby, that's just what you're gonna do and I'll organize the whole thing, for let's say, 15%? What about my girl, what about Betty? Vic, we're talkin' big time here. I know (chuckles). I love her. What happened to your other girls? What went wrong there, Vic? Was it money? If you wanna keep Betty, you gotta marry the old broad! (car engine rumbling) (birds chirping) (dramatic music) [Lucy] You're late, lover boy. My offer just went down $1,000. [Victor] The deal's off. (door creaking) (pensive music) I know what you want, you want more money. How much? Where's Thelma? She's not home. [Victor] Well, where is she? Don't worry, she's not cheating on you. I've arranged for her to see a doctor. I want Thelma to live to be a very old lady. Don't you, Victor? [Victor] You know, you might find this hard to believe, Lucy, but I happen to like the old girl. Now, when's she comin' back? Not 'til five o'clock, and we have the whole place to ourselves. (pensive music) (crickets chirping) (gentle music) [Betty] Why so quiet? [Victor] I'm trying to think of how to say this. [Betty] Oh, Victor. No, no, it's not what you think. Look, I love you and I wanna marry you, but first I have to marry that old lady first, okay? Fine. Then why don't you take me home? Well, I'm doing this for us. For us? Yes, so that we can have a big house, all paid for and money in the bank. Victor, you're such a dummy. We can have a big house and money in the bank but you'll have to work for it. You're lazy, Victor, that's your problem and what does marry her for a little while mean? Are you planning on killing her? Do you think that I could do something like that? [Betty] No. Look, she's 75, she's almost 80, she's got a bad heart, lots of other bad organs. And what if she wants to sleep with you? No, no. That stuff's bad for the heart, too. I mean, if she really wants to you know. Take me home Victor. No, you know how temporary this is. You know how much I love you. You don't love me. (gentle music) (crickets chirping) (Victor sighs) I do love you. It's poverty I hate. (gentle music) (engine rumbling) Victor, I've got some bad news. According to her doctor, it looks like the old gal is not gonna make it. Really, what's wrong with Thelma? Well, a nurse said that she could kick off from stroke, heart failure, kidney trouble any time, and she's been passing blood. Look, we're running out of time, Victor. First you gotta take her down to the license bureau, then you gotta wait three days before you marry her, and by that time she'll start to smell. Is any of this stuff contagious? How would I know? I'm only getting 15%. Okay, this is Friday. We'll get the license this afternoon, we'll get married on Monday. You're really gonna do it? Yep and if she goes as fast as you say you get your 20%. (organ music) (dramatic music) (Victor screams) (birds chirping) God it's me, Victor. I'm gonna need your help. I can't marry both of them, so I'm gonna leave it up to you. I'm gonna flip this coin, God, and if it comes up heads, then I'll know that you want me to marry Thelma, okay? (birds chirping) God, I think that this is important, so I think that we should make it two outta three. I don't think that you understand, God. Thelma's a very sick old lady and I can help her, at least for a little while. Look, I know you're busy. I bet you overlooked that, right? So, we'll flip again. Oh, yeah I know what it was. I was thinking tails. That's it. I said heads but I was thinking tails. So, just to prove it we'll flip again. Why should I mix you up? I know what you want. I'll do it. (crickets chirping) Thelma, I have to ask you something. What's wrong? I've just had this letter from Lucy's doctor and it says that I'm mentally crazy and can't look after my own money and she wants to put me away. (Thelma sniffling) Oh, Victor can she really do it? I don't know. But you are nearly 74. They might think that you'd be better off in a crazy house. Oh, but I don't want to go to a crazy house! Oh, what can I do? Well, they couldn't put you away if you were married. Married? Yeah, sure. You would have a husband to look after you. Victor, are you proposing? (Victor exhales) (crickets chirping) Yes. Victor! (Thelma smooching) Okay, okay. We'll get the marriage license and the blood test today, we'll hide out for the weekend and we'll get married on Monday. Tuesday's Halloween and it's my birthday. I want to get married on Tuesday. It'll be good luck. We'll do it on Tuesday. Why do we have to hide away for the weekend? So that Lucy won't find us. See, she's gonna try to stop us, but by Tuesday it'll be too late. I know a great motel in Salem. Come on, sweetheart, it'll be romantic. (Victor chuckles) (upbeat music) (sign creaking) [Thelma] Hm. Great, first I have your niece to deal with, now this storm. Oh, but Victor you're right. This is so romantic. Yeah and I have the room right next door. Next door? You mean to say we've got separate rooms? Oh yeah, it's very bad luck for the bride to see the groom before the wedding. Oh, I'm gonna be alone all the whole weekend? No, not the whole weekend, just Saturday and Sunday. The phone is right there if you need to talk, and if you need anything I'll be there. (rain pattering) Look Thelma, from now on I'll always be there. You're so sweet, Victor. (rain pattering) (Victor exhales) Oh, hi. Could you connect me with 555-4410? Thank you. (gentle music) Sweetheart, hi. I've gotta talk to you. Where are you? [Victor] Well, I'm at Cap'n Jacks in Salem. Are you with her? Thelma? Yeah, she's right next door. Then I'm sorry Victor, there's nothing to talk about. You've made your choice. I hope you're happy. No, no, no, listen! Listen, I gotta tell- (line clicks) (phone thuds) (rain pattering) (frame thuds) (phone ringing) Hi, sweetheart, I've gotta see you. I'll be right over. Thelma! No, no, stay there. But I thought you wanted to see me? I thought so too but just hearing your voice takes care of it. Besides we can talk on the phone. We're doing it right now (chuckles). Victor, I don't like it here. Yeah, neither do I but just wait 'til Tuesday and then we'll get the wedding license. And least then the storm will be gone. (dramatic music) (rain pattering) (phone ringing) (dramatic music) Hello? Victor, you've been gone all day. Why did you take so long? It's a hurricane, Thelma. It's insane out there. (gasps) Do you think we're safe here? I don't know, it looks like the whole motel is moving closer to the beach. (Betty knocking) I gotta call you back. (gentle music) Are you crazy, going out in a hurricane? Aren't you glad to see me? (Victor sighs) (Betty laughs) Oh Victor, I had to see you. Take this off, you must be soaking. (Victor chuckles) You're wonderful (laughs). Victor, are you- Married? No, not 'til tomorrow, it's her birthday. [Betty] And there's nothing I can do to change your mind? (Thelma knocking) [Thelma] Victor! Look, honey, you're a maid. That's $225,000 coming through that door. Don't let me down. (Victor exhales) (rain pattering) Victor! I heard you talking to someone. Yeah, well, of course you heard me talking to someone. I mean, you know, look at this room. I was yelling at the nurse, maid. Maid? She's a maid? Yeah, that's what I said. I mean, you know they must never clean up around the day around here. I mean, she's probably a trainee. I mean, look at this room. [Thelma] That's not what I came for. There's a frog in my room and I'm scared of frogs. Besides which I don't feel too well. Frog! (Thelma screams) Oh my God, she died. No, she's just fainted Victor, but we should take her to a hospital. She has a fever. Victor, I'm not feeling too good. Why is a maid taking my temperature? I want to go home. Thelma, the maid thinks that we should go to the hospital. I'll go with you. No, you go home. I may need you there, I'll call. (rain pattering) It's gonna be all right, Thelma. (gentle music) You're gonna be all right. Thelma, I'm gonna take care of you. (rain pattering) (dramatic music) (air whooshing) (dramatic music) (rain pattering) Your fiancee? That old woman is your fiancee? Guard, get him the hell outta here. Go! Let's go. [Doctor] And if I see him in here again, shoot the son of a bitch. Read my lips. No! Don, I'm not gonna go higher than 25%! (thunder booming) Okay, buddy. 25%. (dog howling) Get on over here and bring the marriage license. What? Oh, I left it at the motel. I'll pick it up, I'll bring it right over. (thunder booming) (dramatic music) I've been waiting for you. (Victor gasps) Oh well, if it isn't Lucy. How'd you find us? Money, honey. You can do anything with money. Forget something, Victor? Why don't you give me that purse? You can't have it. What, you think that I can't take that? I think you should take that up with Bruno. Bruno? (rain pattering) (pensive music) (thunder booming) Victor, I'd like you to meet Bruno. (Bruno yelling) (pensive music) Bruno is sort of an electrician. He's gonna put your lights out. Did you get that, Victor? Oh yeah, you're gonna get it. Now, Bruno! (dramatic music) (air whooshing) Ow, that was my leg! He's over there! (pensive music) (Bruno yelling) (men grunting) (objects crashing) (thunder booming) (dramatic music) Hiya! (Victor gasps) (Victor groans) (pensive music) (Victor yells) (water splashing) (dramatic music) (thunder rumbling) (Bruno yelling) (dramatic music) (cracking noise) (water splashing) (pensive music) [Lucy] Did you get him? No, he didn't. Victor, you bastard! (rain pattering) (wind howling) You should have got rid of this. My leg! You lousy pervert, this is all your fault! (dramatic music) (thunder rumbling) (water splashing) (car engine revving) (wind howling) Give me a break! (Don laughing) Hi ya, Vic! [Victor] Come on, let's get goin'! Hold on, there's a hurricane comin', I don't wanna lose my trailer. Come on! She's tied down already, let's go! Yeah, but I gotta put out extra lines, my mother's inside. Don, how much is 30% of 225,000? 68,000. Where are we going? To Thelma's house, it's over near Quincy Center. [Don] We're gonna need a rope. A rope? [Don] We can't very well walk out of the front door of the hospital with her. We're gonna need a good rope. How high is she? Three stories, about 30 feet. [Don] Okay, we lower her down, drive off you get married, simple. (chuckles) Yeah, except she's not allowed visitors and if the guard sees me I'll get shot. Don't worry, that's the second part of my plan. (upbeat music) (rain pattering) And for this I get 68 grand, right? Oh yeah, but there's one string. Don't tell me, let me guess, I've gotta stay away from Betty! I don't want you talkin' to her. That is one girl that is not goin' in your scrapbook. And another thing, I don't like these tits. They're too lumpy. I'll find the tits, just try the wig on. (rain pattering) Here you go. (Victor sighs) Now, here's how we do it, Vic. If anybody stops us, we just flew in from Texas to visit your poor dying aunt. Let's just hope the old lady is still dying. (gentle music) You are a heartless mother. Yes I am, but at least I'll admit it. I suppose you're hoping she gets better. (gentle music) (rain pattering) (upbeat music) Whoa! (thunder rumbling) It's a few more miles to the hospital, do you think this wreck will make it? Sure it will. I realize it's not a new car like yours, but then again I haven't gotten around to sleeping with any old ladies yet (chuckles). Look at this hurricane. I don't think I've ever been this close to one. You know, I always wanted to be in the eye of a hurricane. All of a sudden its quiet, no wind, no rain. Why? I don't know, just to say I was there. Hey, look at that! Hey, forget it! I just figured she might be grateful. And you call me a heartless mother. Well, maybe I am but I'm paying you a lot of money for your cooperation. So, for the next couple of hours no booze and no girls, okay? Okay, okay, but maybe I wouldn't be so horny if you kept your dress down and act like a lady. "Heartless mother." (engine rumbling) (pensive music) Now, remember just like we own the place. Why can't we use the back stairs? Stairs are for crooks. We're gonna do this the right way. Hey, excuse me. My wife and I are looking for Thelma Marshal. Thelma Marshal. Yes, she's a patient of Dr. Schwartz. Oh, yes. She's in the west wing. If you'll follow me, please. (eerie music) (wind whistling) Thelma? Thelma? Do you know who I am? You know who I am now? Victor, what happened? We had to sneak him in. The doctor thinks Victor's a creep. (rain pattering) (thunder rumbling) Get away from her, you're scaring her. We're gonna get you outta here. (thunder rumbling) (wind whistling) Hey Vic, this chick's dead! [Victor] Was it us? We haven't been here long enough to kill her. Are you sure? Sure, I'm sure. We've got one more problem. We can't just put the old lady out the window in a storm, she'll blow away. Okay, so how do we get her out of the hospital? I'll go out and check the halls. You get your girlfriend ready to go. Okay. Look sweetie, we're gonna get you out now, okay? But how are you going to get me out? Oh, we're just gonna go down the staircase or out the window. Halls are almost clear, we can take her out the front door and make a run for it. (thunder booming) (dramatic music) (metal clanging) (thunder rumbling) (pensive music) What are we gonna do now? You were gonna back me up, now what? We can make a run for it, Vic. Use the back stairs? (thunder rumbling) Why is it so quiet in here? It's a cardiac ward. It's supposed to be quiet. I guess. It's kinda spooky. (pensive music) Don, it's not quiet in here, it's quiet out there. Let's go. (pensive music) Even God wants us to get married. He stopped the hurricane for us! God didn't stop the storm, Vic. This is the one place I always wanted to be, the eye of the hurricane. (pensive music) What's going on here? You're gonna kill her! I'm going to get Dr. Schwartz. (rain pattering) It's okay, sweet face. We'll have you down in a flash! (rain pattering) (wind whistling) (suspenseful music) (dramatic music) (rain pattering) (Thelma screaming) (thunder rumbling) (siren wailing) (dramatic music) Oh shit, it's Lucy! Pull her back! (gentle music) Shut that window! Dr. Schwartz is coming with the guard. They'll take care of you. Poor woman. Do you realize I have a woman in the next room who's dying? Well, do you realize you have a woman in this room that's dead? Do you realize it's quite possible that you killed this woman? She's been dead for hours. Well, maybe you didn't do this one, but I've got one next door who's receiving the last rites and I know you're the cause of that one. The last rites? Who's giving them, a priest? Of course he's a priest! Hey Vic, a priest can marry people! Where are you going? (dramatic music) (wind whistling) (gentle music) What are you doing? Father, we need your help. We have two people in this room and they wanna get married. Can you help us, Father? [Priest] Positively not. Hey, this is the Police Department, open the door! Tom, take it down! (ax thudding) (dramatic music) Okay Mister, are you gonna open the door? (dramatic music) There's nothing you can say. Father, I've gotta talk to you in private. My friends just wanna get married and if you don't help them, you're gonna need a priest. You can't marry them, it's not legal! Dearly beloved. (thunder booming) (suspenseful music) Will you Victor, take Thelma to be your lawfully wedded wife, to have and to hold, from this day forward I'll get you, you dumb barber. in sickness and health 'til death do you part? Will you Thelma take this man Victor to be your lawfully wedded husband, to have and to hold from this day forward? (all chattering) (ax thuds) I hereby pronounce you man and wife. (all cheering) (organ music) Woo hoo! You're the best best man in the world! You're in for another 5%! Is that all? A lousy 5%? Oh, don't worry sweetie, it's all a mistake, everything's gonna be all right. (air whooshing) (crutch thuds) (pensive music) (Victor thuds) (Lucy laughing) (thunder booming) (wind whistling) (gentle music) (birds chirping) [Thelma] Is there anything in the mail, Victor? More wedding congratulations. Anything about us in the paper? Oh, yes there is, in the people's column. Oh, here it is. "Congratulations to Victor Hertz, 35, and the former Thelma Marshal, 73, who were married in Salem Hospital one week ago today. The trick-or-treat couple (chuckling), had a bridal shower provided by Hurricane Gloria." Isn't that cute, Victor? (phone ringing) Hello. [Don] Hello Vic, how's the newlywed? Not too good. That's funny, you should feel great. You're famous, you know. I always knew you were out of your mind and now the whole town knows it. Well screw everybody in town and you too if that's why you called. No, I've got something important to talk to you about. (Don sneezes) What's wrong with you? I think I'm gettin' the flu or somethin'. That's great, why don't you come over? [Don] I'll be over in a few minutes. Bye! Who was that? That was Don, he's coming right over. Where's our checkbook? Our checkbook? Well, what does he want? I have to write him a check. I owe him some money. Oh, well my checkbook is in the bureau in the metal box with my other papers, and don't forget to bring my pen. And oh, another thing I wanted to talk to you about, you're spending far too much money. I shall have to not give you such a big allowance if you keep on like this. Oh, and besides which, your laundry bill is getting very high. I don't know what you're doing. Oh, and by the way Victor, I don't know why you're using so much electricity. Another thing too, there's far too much hot water. You know, all this is costing me an awful lot and I do hope you understand this, Victor. I'm going to cut off your allowance. You're really getting a bit (speaking faintly). Thelma, you're a liar. What do you mean? Why did you lie about your age? Is that all? Well, I always lie about my age. Women are allowed to do that, you know. Yeah sure I know that woman lie about their age, but they usually say that they're younger. You said you were 74, your birth certificate says that you're 64. Why did you lie? Because I like compliments, that's why. (clock ticking) What the hell does that mean? Well, when people ask me how old I am and I say I'm 73 they say how good I look and I like that, that's why. This is the thanks that I get. You know, I thought that you'd be grateful that I married you. You married me because you thought I was a goner. Well, I'm gonna be here for a long time, Victor. (engine rumbling) (birds chirping) (car horn honking) Okay, all right, calm down. I think that Don's here. Well, you go along and play with your friend. I'm going to have a bath. (car horn honks) (door latches) [Don] Hiya, Vic! Hey, come on inside. Thelma's about to take a bath, but first I want you to kiss her hello. You mean kiss her goodbye, don't you? Yeah. Vic, sit down. I wanna talk to you. Yeah? How's your mouth? Four stitches, but it was worth it to get rid of fat Lucy. The cops arrested her. That's swell, Vic. Hey, listen let's go inside. Thelma (smooching). I can't do it. I've done a lot of crummy things in my life, but I've never killed anybody. I'll be damned. The crookedest man in town and now he finds religion. What kind of hoodlums are you hangin' out with anyway? Vic, I wanted to talk to you man-to-man about this. Oh, you bastard. Don't you remember our agreement? I told you to stay away from her. I know, Vic. I just couldn't help myself. - Oh, I can see it all now. You marry me to the old bag so that you can move in on Betty. It's not gonna work. Betty thinks that you're a creep. Vic, we're getting married. (solemn music) What? I knew you wouldn't believe me, so I brought Betty along. (solemn music) You can have the money, Vic. That old lady ain't gonna die, she's gonna keep right on havin' birthdays. (solemn music) (birds chirping) Hello, Victor. Hi, Betty. I read about your wedding in the paper. You're famous, you know? How's your wife? Oh, fine. I married her and she's 10 years younger. So, now you hang around and wait for her to die? What about Don? You mean about us getting married? Mm hm. He asked me. What'd you say? I said I'd think about it. You're doing this to get even, right? No I'm not, Victor. I need somebody and I think Don needs somebody. He's a liar, he's a thief, he's a back-stabber. I'm his best friend, look what he did to me. Victor, you haven't seen the real Don. He has a gentle side. Yeah, he's also got an album with all of the girls that he's had. You're not gonna be his wife, you're gonna be number 87. And if you think he's gonna stop that close to 100 you're crazy. Well, maybe he was a little wild but people can change. You changed. Yeah, I sure did. For the first time in my life I realize the importance of money. Don doesn't have any. No, and he never will, he'll never have anything. He'll have me. (solemn music) (Victor sighs) Why can't you wait for me? I love you Victor, but you're a married man. It's a funny world, isn't it? Yeah. Even a funny world has its share of bad jokes. (solemn music) Goodbye, Victor. (solemn music) (birds chirping) (car engine revving) Oh Poopsie, I'm ready to make whoopee! (playful music) (pensive music) (engine rumbling) (dramatic music) (upbeat music) Where is Victor? I think your husband just left you. Oh, well. I always thought he'd leave me for a younger woman. Come on, Thelma. I'll walk you inside. (gentle music) (birds chirping) You know Thelma, some people just can't be trusted.
