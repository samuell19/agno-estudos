Pick up, Nicolette! Please pick up! No, no, no! Get in the car, Brooke. Let's go. Woman: You got her. Yeah. But she was on the phone with this girl, Nicolette. - Who's got the phone? - I have Brooke's phone. We'll use it to track the other girl and see what she's up to. -Keep me posted. Excuse me. Have you seen this girl? If you do, can you contact that number at the bottom? Thank you. Hi there. Um, have you seen this girl? OK. She's a really good friend of mine. Her name's Brooke Summers. If you happen to see her, then can you please contact this number at the bottom? Thank you. Hi. Um, I was just wondering if you've seen this girl. She's been missing for a couple days. Sorry to interrupt. Have you seen this girl? She's a really good friend of mine. She's been missing for a couple of days. If you happen to see her, can you just contact me? Woman on phone: Where are you now? I've been tracking the girl she was trying to call. Woman: Good. And you found her? She's actively looking for Brooke. -We can't have her mess with the plan. You need to stop this. I understand what needs to be done. Sorry! I, I didn't see you. Oh, uh... Have you seen this girl? Uh, no. Sorry. Man's voice: You think this is it, finally? Woman: I think we have a good shot. I mean, that had to be morning sickness. It's time. Maybe it was just that bad Thai food from last night. Yeah. Mark, wait! Let's talk about this. It's my fault. We both know it. Hey! It's no one's fault. So, how do you feel about finally starting your new dream job? I'm kinda anxious about having to start in the middle of the school year. Look. Don't stress. You're gonna be amazing. Callie, you talked to Nicolette today? She's not answering my texts and she's supposed to be home by now. -No. Maybe she stayed late at school for tutoring though. -The school called. She was absent for most of the day. As soon as you hear from Nicolette, tell her I wanna speak with her. Nicolette. Nicolette, sweetie, we talked about this. You can't skip school. You're gonna end up getting a suspension if you do. -I'm not gonna stop until I find out what happened to Brooke. I don't care what it takes. -If you miss class again, unexcused, the principal is going to be on the phone with me. As long as you live here, I'm responsible for you! OK. Nicolette: I still feel so guilty that I missed her call, Vanesha. I can't shake the feeling that something horrible's happened to Brooke. Brooke has never given up on me since we were twelve. I'm not gonna give up on her. She's been gone for three days. Well, then she'll probably turn up any time now. Remember when she disappeared from the group home? Only to find out she ran off with Trent to be at his family's place in Idaho. We were worried over nothin'. I know. But this time it just feels different. Maybe Trent caught up with her as soon as she got here. I mean she's what, nine months pregnant by now? Where would she go? You OK? Yeah, uh, I'm fine. It's nothing. Let's just go inside. So, Sandy, you ready for this? As ready as I'll ever be, Madeline. Are you regretting this change of career yet? Missed your days as an accountant? What's this? Oh. Brooke Summers was a student who disappeared months ago. Some of the students had put those up. But then the girl calls her friends after three weeks to let them know that she actually ran off with a boyfriend. Such a shame. Brooke had lots of potential. Sandy: Everyone take a seat, please. Oh! Tardy on the new teacher's first day I see. Yeah, sorry. Traffic. You know how it is. Jake Hamilton, here. Welcome, everyone. I'm Ms. Ridling. I'll be taking over for Ms. Jenkins' eleventh-grade English classes. I assume everyone kept up with the readings assigned by Ms. Jenkins before she left and are ready to talk about Fitzgerald's classic... The Great Gatsby. Who can tell me the name of the narrator of the novel? In the back? What's your name? It's Nicolette. Well, Nicolette, you know the school's policy on cellphones in class, correct? Phone, please. You can get it at the end of the day in the office. There you are! You missed our entire first class. Yeah. OK, lady. I've got bigger fish to fry. Are you OK? You don't look well. Is it a stomach bug or the flu? Don't worry about it. Or is it something else? Can I get you anything or... Can you leave me alone? I'll be back this afternoon for the nurse. Your stuff is still in the classroom on my desk... OK! I'll go get it! Please! Help! The baby's coming! I need you to keep breathing, honey. Not yet, OK? I changed my mind! I wanna keep my baby! That is not an option, Brooke! Not now. You made an agreement. I'll go to the police! I'll tell them what you do here! Excuse me, Nicolette! What do you want this time? Are you feeling any better? I'm fine. It's none of your business. Go be a good-doer somewhere else. Uh, Nicolette? If you need someone to talk to about your possible situation, I'm here. Listen, Miss Suburbia. I highly doubt you have any clue of what I'm going though right now. That one can be a challenge. Smart but not focused, to say the least. Kind of like I was at her age. Oh, and she's the one whose friend went missing, too. There's always a lot going on with her, so don't take it personally. Where's my baby? Please don't do this! The boss has already given her to a new couple. I don't want your money, just my baby! I should have never come back here! You are gonna dig yourself into a grave, young lady, if you don't get into line. You hear me? So what are you gonna do if you are pregnant? I don't know. I, I thought that we were careful. Famous last words, man. Nothing in this world's a hundred percent. I mean, first Brooke. Now maybe you. I might just stay celibate till I'm forty. Mm-hm. I mean, I don't, I don't know what I'm gonna do. I finally had like a plan: go to nursing school, have a life of my own finally. Hm. Is it, uh... -Jake's? Yeah. And he's barely talked to me since. Yeah. Oh! Speaking of, I'm gonna go talk to him. I'll be back. Jake? Jake, I need to talk to you! I didn't think we had anything else to talk about, Nicolette. I'm seeing someone else now. I know. I heard the gossip. You're dating that new girl from the pricey private school uptown, right? Listen, it's nothing against you. It's just... things just didn't work out. Do you wanna know why I was sick this morning in class? I don't care. It's not my business. No, you're, you're lying, right? You're joking? Well, I don't know yet, but if I am? You're lying. I don't have time for this. You need to eat and hydrate if you're gonna get your energy back. The boss said she'll buy you a bus ticket to Los Angeles. Isn't that nice? You know, you can take that money that she gave you and start over with a brand-new life. She even knows someone who can give a job to a young pretty girl like yourself. You have no idea how lucky you really are. Please, can you get it for me? I don't have the strength. Brooke? Brooke! Brooke! Come back here! Where the hell's the girl? She escaped! She, she took my phone! Where'd she go? I, I don't know! Gimme your phone! I can track mine if she tries to use it! I can't believe you're still here! It's almost seven! I'm just trying to get as much prep work done as I can. Get outta here! The rest can wait till tomorrow. I promise. Good night. You're still here? School ended hours ago. Great observation, Sherlock. Well, if the nurse isn't here by now Yeah, I know. The office told me that she had to come by to drop something off before the school locked up at the end of the day. I probably shouldn't do this But I have a master key. Hm. You're in luck. Here you go. She keeps it just under the counter. I'm sure she won't mind if you take one. Why are you helping me? Look, I know we don't know each other very well but... No, you don't know me at all. I remember what it's like to be a teen. Spare me! I hate it when adults say they remember what it was like when they were my age, when you have no idea what I've been through! Look. I appreciate everything that you've done for me, OK? Just I can take it from here. Nicolette. Are you OK? I took a pregnancy test and it's positive. I might have some insight into your situation, you know. How? I got pregnant when I was sixteen. Really? It's true. I had just finished my sophomore year. And my boyfriend and I, well, we weren't careful. And my parents, well, let's just say they were not thrilled. They were worried about keeping up appearances because of my father's job, so they sent me across the country to live with my grandparents. Told everybody I was studying in Europe. I put the baby up for adoption. I didn't even get a chance to hold her. I couldn't handle it at the time. And then when I came back, my parents and I just never spoke about it. That relationship has been distant ever since. So I may be Miss Suburbia, but I might have some idea of what you're going through. Maybe. I have to head home. But remember my offer if you need someone to talk to. Hello? Nicolette, It's me! Oh, my God! Brooke? OK, listen carefully! I don't have much time. There's this woman named Abigal and she's after me and my baby is missing! OK, meet me at our spot in twenty minutes! Wait! Brooke, where are you? Nicolette? Brooke! Brooke! Brooke! Watch out! You all right? Nicolette! Oh, my God! Are you OK? Hardly. Officer: We'll talk more. Give me a call if you remember anything new, day or night, OK? Here's my card. I still can't process all that's happened. I'm Detective Holmes with homicide. Do you think what happened to Brooke wasn't an accident? According to Nicolette, the car that struck her friend was aiming right for her. Did Nicolette see who was driving? She couldn't recall any identifying features on the driver. We'll be back. She might remember details later. Hey! Where you been? Got the history notes from class? Brooke's dead. -What? Sandy: And then, in my fourth period class, two boys decided to fight over the same girl. I swear, so much in this job has nothing to do with actually teaching English. You can do anything you set your mind to, and you've been wanting to teach for years now. You'll start getting the hang of this whole classroom management thing. Well, I hope you're right. I am. You know my student, Nicolette, the one I told you I was worried about? Yeah. Well, turns out she's pregnant. I actually went into the nurse's office to get her a test. I just hope she talks to me if she needs someone to lean on. She's quite the firecracker. I have some news on my end. What is it? Our new VP at work, Gil, asked me to, uh, travel to Charleston for a few weeks. Construction on a new hotel there's a mess and he wants me to oversee things, so I have to leave tomorrow morning. A few weeks? Yes. I know. I'm not thrilled about it either, but I need Gil on my side if I wanna move up. I understand. I'll make it up to you when I come back. I promise. You better. Why couldn't she have just kept her mouth shut? You're lucky I found her at all. Did we really have to kill her? I just can't stop thinking about her. I'm so sorry about Brooke, Nicolette. She was always really nice to me. What could've happened to Brooke's baby though? It doesn't make any sense. It's Rachel. What does she want now? She just wants to make sure you're OK. She's worried about you. Yeah. It's a little too late, don't you think? Hi, Nicolette. Why don't you have a seat? I can't imagine what you've been through. Brooke was a great girl and I know you two were close. I want you to know that you can come and talk to me anytime you need to. Stress can take a toll, and I've heard through the grapevine that you've been waking up sick the past few mornings. Do we really have to talk about this now? Because I'm pretty messed up after what I just saw. I know, sweetie. But if you've found yourself in a delicate situation, you can come to me for help. That's why I'm here. No one can help me with this. I have seen a lot in my years here, Nicolette, and I know when the signs are pointing to one of my girls being pregnant. I knew it about Brooke, too. Are you pregnant? Well, if you are, I'd like to introduce you to someone who I think can assist. She's an amazing woman who's worked with girls in the past in a similar dilemma. After you've taken the time to process your grief about Brooke, of course, I'll make it through. I always do. Nothing as fun as an early morning flight. You got everything? Did you remember clean socks? Oh, damn! See, I knew I forgot something. Yes, babe, I remembered clean socks. Well, I had to ask, you know, after that meeting you had in San Francisco where you Didn't realize I forgot clean socks ten minutes before going into a meeting. Yes. Yes. I'll miss you. I hate leaving you the first week of your new job. I'll be fine. All right. Mark? Yeah? I had a thought on my run. Uh, maybe we can talk to that IVF specialist that your co-worker used. I mean, it's, it's worth a shot just to get some information about it, right? OK. Um, how 'bout we talk about that when I come back? OK. What does he want? You don't have to talk to him if you don't want to. I'll be right back. So, now you wanna talk? Look, I just heard about Brooke. Is it true that you saw when she got hit by a car? Yeah. It's true. I'm sorry to hear that. What do you want, Jake? I just have to know. Are you...? Pregnant? Yeah, I'm pregnant! Please, just lower your voice, for me. Go to hell, Jake! Please. I talked to my mom about you maybe being pregnant. You did? Well, I can't imagine what she said. She's not really a big fan of mine, right? Sorry that you got the girl from the wrong side of the tracks pregnant, rich boy. She wants to make an arrangement. OK? Just all you have to do is sign a couple of documents that her lawyer draws up and we'll be good. What do you mean 'an arrangement'? It's money, Nicolette, to do whatever, whatever option you wanna do. So you really think that throwing money at this situation is gonna make things better, it's gonna solve things? No, but... - This is your kid! I'm sorry. It's the best I can do right now. According to her social worker, Brooke last lived here five months ago. Is that correct? Yes. From what I understand, she ran off with her boyfriend. I think the girls said his name was Trent. We'll look into her boyfriend. She turned eighteen, so there wasn't anything we could do when she left. It's unfortunate, but sometimes our girls don't make the best decisions. -One thing we didn't expect is we found an envelope with a large amount of cash on her body. Oh, really? We're still unsure how a girl in her situation would have that much cash on her. Nicolette, do you have a second? The girl who died... Brooke, She was your friend, wasn't she? I'm so sorry. Nicolette: Every time I close my eyes, I just see the car heading straight towards Brooke. And between that and having my life upended, finding out that I'm pregnant, I mean... I've been living at a depressing group home for two years. What can I do with a child? What do I have to offer it? What about your family? I've never met my dad. And my mom... there were lots of men. She got addicted to prescription pain medication and then CPS came by once one of the neighbors found out that, um, I'd been spending most of my nights alone. So I had nowhere else to go. That's how I ended up at the group home. I'm so sorry, Nicolette. Someone your age should never have to go through something like that. Yeah, well, it's just my reality. Do um... do you ever think about the baby that you put up for adoption? Every day. But I have no doubt I made the right decision for my child. I knew I was not ready to be a mother. Is that what you're thinking for your child, adoption? Maybe. Can I give you some advice? Take your time with this decision, OK? Don't rush into it. I probably would have chosen adoption regardless but I wish I'd taken more time to come to that conclusion. And if you ever need to talk about it or anything, let me know, OK? Yeah. Thanks for taking the time to talk to me. A lot of adults just see me as a problem that they need to deal with. I guess that's why I act the way that I do. I mean, why try to be different or better if everyone has low expectations for you anyways? Oh, honey, you are a great kid who's just in a tough situation. OK? Don't let it define the rest of your life. My friend, Brooke, she ran away just after she got pregnant and then showed up back in town five months later, where she died. What happened to the baby? I don't know, but she definitely wasn't pregnant anymore when I saw her. Let me see your phone. Why? Just trust me. I'm gonna put in my number. You can call me anytime, OK? I hope they find out what happened to your friend. Oh no! Are you OK? Yeah. I'm just realizing that uh... morning sickness happens- it can hit you twenty-four/seven. I'll make you a deal. Both the group home and the drug store are on my way home. If you promise to study for your Great Gatsby quiz, I'll bring you something to deal with your morning sickness. Sometimes people just wanna be nice, Nicolette. Rachel: She just found out so... here she is. Nicolette, could I see you in my office, please? Just for a minute. Abigail: Here she is! Nicolette. I'm Abigail. I've so been looking forward to meeting you. And I am really sorry to hear about what happened to your friend. Rachel: Why don't I give you two some alone time so you can get acquainted? Would that be all right with you, Nicolette? Well then, I'll be outside. Thank you, Rachel, for this and everything you do for all the girls. Now Nicolette, Rachel told me that you recently found out you're pregnant. I know that this can be a very scary and unsettling time for you, especially a girl your age. What's your deal? What do you want? I like that: straight to business. I happen to run one of the most prestigious private adoption agencies in the state and our prospective parents are amazingly pedigreed. They are highly educated, professional, and very well off. They're willing to compensate. Are you saying that you wanna sell my baby? That would be illegal. But it is quite common, and legal, for many parents to pay for the living expenses or to put together a little trust fund for your college expenses. You see, private adoption's not just a loving choice for your baby but it's a good choice to carve a positive path forward for you. Would you mind if we go over the particulars together? So this is a lot to take in and I'm sure that you will have many questions. I expect that and that is perfectly normal. This has my cellphone number on it. You can call me anytime. And trust me when I tell you, you are making the best choice when you're considering adoption for your child. How are things going? Well, I think she has a lot to consider, but Nicolette is a smart girl. Hi. Hi. Here ya go. Thanks! It's just some ginger candies that my cousin swore by when she was pregnant. Thanks. This means a lot. It's no big deal. Like I said, this place is on my way. How are you feeling? It's been a lot. A woman from the adoption agency just came by to talk to me. She did? Yeah. Rachel: May I help you? This is my English teacher, Ms. Ridling. She just came by to drop something off. Well, that was nice of her. This is Rachel. She runs the group home. And this is Abigail. She runs the adoption agency. It's so nice to meet you. It's wonderful to see such a dedicated educator. Nice to meet you too. Well, I guess I'll be going. Nicolette, we'll talk soon. Is it normal for the manager here to refer girls to a specific adoption agency? I don't know. But, um... I do remember Brooke talking about adoption but... But, what? It was painful for her to talk about her pregnancy. It was the first time where I felt a lot of distance between us. And, God, now I really understand what she was going through. I finally had a plan for my life. Kinda wanted to be a nurse, help people. You still can, Nicolette. It may sound cliché, but it's true. Where there's a will, there's a way. I can't believe that this is all we have left of Brooke. It's only 'cause she forgot it. We made this in sixth-grade art class together. What is it gonna take for people to actually care about what happens to kids like us? I'm gonna find out what happened to Brooke. Claudia's in your office. You need to talk to her. I saw she bought a plane ticket on her phone. Another problem. We're starting to get way too many of those in this city. I want you to start following the Nicolette girl, find out where she goes. It could be useful information for us in the very near future. Something wrong, Claudia? -I only took this job because I desperately needed the cash to help pay for my mother's experimental cancer treatments. But, uh, it doesn't always feel... right. Keeping some of these girls locked up and No one is locked up. They are simply detained until they give birth. I know. It's just, uh It's just a lot. I know. Why don't you go home and get some rest? Everything will look brighter tomorrow. OK. Hey. Alex! What are you- I think you know why I'm here, Claudia. You're just a liability now. Nicolette: There it goes. A message to Brooke's good-for-nothing boyfriend, Trent. I thought you said Trent hasn't even been on that site in years. I don't know. It's worth a shot. Maybe he'll log back in. Maybe he has some information on the investigation. Um, I'll see you later. I, I gotta take care of something. Hey, can I talk to you? Now. Catch you later, man. What's up? I've been thinking about putting the baby up for adoption. OK. Sandy: Don't forget to answer the questions at the end of chapter seven, OK? Have a good evening! Sandy: Somebody did well on their quiz. Uh, yeah. Those ginger candies you got me for nausea helped me concentrate and study. Did you think more about the meeting that you had with that lady? Yeah, but, um, I, I don't know yet. Again, take your time with this decision. Would you have some time to talk to me about it more? I just, I have some questions about your experience. Sure. Did you wanna grab a bite at the diner on Fifth Street? I have a teacher meeting now, but I could meet you there at seven-thirty. My treat! No. It's OK. You don't have to do that. No, no, no. It's no big deal. See you there? Yeah. I'll see you there. How are you, Nicolette? I just wanted to touch base. I know how tough things have been. That's an understatement of the year. Well, we're having your favorite for dinner tonight, pizza! That should put a smile on your face. I'm actually going out for dinner with someone. And who would that be? I won't be back late, OK? Oh, hey there! Hey. It's such a shame about Brooke Summers. So young. I can't stop thinking about the poor girl. Yeah, I know. It's horrible. Nicolette's been very brave, considering how close they were. I just hope they find who did it. Agh! Hey, Nicolette. Sorry. I'm just running a few minutes late. I've fallen! I'm scared I might have hurt the baby! I'm at the parking lot across from the diner. Stay there. I'm on my way! How's the baby? You're very lucky. The baby is fine. You need to be careful. Since you did have some spotting and cramping, I wanna keep you overnight just in case. Was that your mom in here earlier? Oh, no. That's my teacher. She did the right thing in rushing you here. Hey, hon. - Hey! I just wanted to check in and see if you were able to get us an appointment with the doctor. Oh. Sorry. I've been a little distracted lately. What's wrong? Well, you know my student Nicolette that I told you about? Yeah. Well, she thinks she was being followed and fell as she ran off. I brought her to the hospital and she's with a doctor now. That's terrible! I know. It is. This poor girl has been through hell the past forty-eight hours and I can't shake the feeling that... That? That something bad is gonna happen. Nicolette! I got here as fast as I could! Oh, you poor thing. I'm Dr. Gibbs. And you are? I'm Rachel. I manage the group home where Nicolette currently lives. I should be her emergency contact. Hm. Oh, Nicolette! You've been through enough as it is. Dr. Gibb: Please talk to the charge nurse so we can get your information. And you need to get some rest, young lady. I'll check on you later. I had just got a call from Abigail from the adoption agency before I got here. I told her what happened, and she wants to come check in on you later. Yeah, I guess. Callie: Do you have any news on Nicolette? Yeah. She stayed overnight at the hospital. She was convinced someone was following her. I don't know. So many crazy things have been happening lately! What is it? Brooke's boyfriend Trent just messaged me. He finally checked the social media app. He's in town and he wants to meet up. How did this happen to Brooke? And where's my baby? You need to calm down, Trent, if we're gonna figure out what happened. I can't believe nobody told me what happened to Brooke, or my baby! Well, what happened between you two? Huh? When was the last time you saw her? What happened in Idaho, Trent? Things were going OK. We just moved in with my parents. I know it's not perfect. One morning I wake up and Brooke's gone. She left a note there saying she went to L.A. to give our baby up for adoption! Los Angeles? - Yeah! And like an idiot, I went down there to look for a friend of hers to bring her back. But she lied to me to throw me off track, 'cause obviously she was here. Where are you goin'? To talk to somebody at that group home! They don't know anything! Trent! Were you able to get some sleep last night? No. Did the doctor come in already? Yeah. Hello, Nicolette. I'm glad you called me. So you're saying someone was following you last night. I... I don't know. But it, it felt like it though. Would you mind giving us a minute? Wouldn't it help if I stayed here for this? No. I'll be fine. I'll be right outside if you need me. OK, Nicolette. Let's start at the beginning. OK. Abigail! Where have you been? I can't take this anymore. Rein it in, Rachel. There's a cop in there with her! I pay you handsomely to keep your cool. Remember that. Was she able to give you any information that might help? She gave me a good number of details. It's important to remember that Nicolette's traumatized by seeing what happened to her friend so... she may have let her imagination get the best of her. However, she was a witness to a possible homicide, so we need to take everything seriously. Well, of course. And you are? I'm Abigail. I'm a friend. Well, please tell Nicolette to contact me if she remembers anything new. Will do. Thank you, detective. What now? I'm going to speak with her. Let me handle it. Abigail: Have you given any more thought to adoption? Yeah. Um, my teacher helped me understand that it's important to take my time with such a big decision. That's, um, all that I have left of Brooke. Tell you what. How 'bout I order you a ride share? The car can come and pick you up right here, stop by the drugstore. Pick up anything you need before you go home. Yeah, I guess that's OK. Um, I think that the doctor said they'll release me a little after seven. Great! I will order you a car for then. Oh, um... It's, um, it's a friend. Oh. I'll let you take that. Thanks. This is a surprise. Yeah. I just wanted to check in, see how you're doing. Yeah. It was an accident. I fell. It's a long story. And... the baby? It's fine. Yeah. They just, have me here a little longer for observation. Um, I was thinking. The woman from the adoption agency Loving Arms just came by to check on me. And I'm still leaning towards the decision of adoption as the best option for the baby. Hey, listen. I never told you this but my dad's not my birth dad. My mom had a rough, short first marriage and well, I was a result of it. My dad adopted me when I was two and married my mom but Yeah, don't get me wrong. He's great but... But, what Jake? Sometimes I just wonder. Like why wasn't I enough for my birth dad to stick around? Nicolette seems to have the address of our birthing rooms written on a piece of paper. Abigail: I think Claudia gave it to Brooke when she came back to town. What do you think we should do? I need you to come up with a story for why Nicolette won't be returning to the group home tonight. Are you listening to me? Yes. Good! Talk soon. Alex, it's time to now move locations. Be sure to get our passports ready. -Sure, I'll talk to Rachel Don't tell Rachel anything. You the lady who run this place? Yes, I am. So where's Brooke at? Hey, sweetie! How are things going? Good. How are you doin' today? Well, it's been quite the week. How's your student? Well, she's still in the hospital, but I think she's going to be released today, thankfully. OK. Well, I have some good news that will cheer you up. Really? So I just found out I'm getting this huge bonus, thanks to that hotel deal I just closed. That's awesome! We can use the money to pay off... Actually, what do you think about us using that money to pay for IVF treatments? Really? You, you wanna try it? Why not? It's always been the money that held us back. That's great. Uh, let's do it! I'll make an appointment for when you get back. OK. Bye, babe. OK. Bye. Once Brooke left the home, we never heard from her again. Yeah, but what about that lady she said was trying to talk her into the adoption? Uh, Abby, or Abigail, something like that. She said someone from here connected her to that agency. Maybe that woman knows something about my baby! I have an idea. Why don't you give me your contact information? I'll do some digging on my end and I'll get back to you by the end of the night. I promise. All right. You didn't have to come back, you know. I was so worried about you. Those are beautiful. Oh, yeah. It was a gift from Abigail from the adoption agency. Really? She was here? Yeah. That's interesting. Thank you for everything that you did for me last night. I told you. You can count on me. You know, talking to you about your situation has me thinking a lot about what I went through. How so? Remember when I said that my parents didn't talk about my baby when I came home after having her? I think on some level I knew how much that affected me, how much it had made me blame myself for the entire thing. I thought maybe me not being able to conceive now is because of the shame I brought on my upstanding parents. No! You would make an amazing mom. You did the best that you could, just like I'm trying to do right now. Are you sure you're only sixteen? 'Cause that was pretty darn wise. I have my moments, I guess. I can stick around and give you a ride home if you want. No, it's OK. You've done enough. I actually, I have a ride share, OK. Well, If anything changes, you can call me. OK? Will do. Trent: Hello? Trent, it's Rachel at the group home. I might have some information about Brooke but we need to keep it between the two of us for the moment. - Yeah, OK. It's very important. Can you do that? Sure. Of course! Good. Meet me at 515 Morrison downtown. We have to do this in secret, for Brooke. -I'll be there. You Trent? Yeah? And you are? Ah! I can't concentrate with everything going on! Nicolette was supposed to be back by now! Rachel said she was coming home tonight! I've been here three years, you know? Brooke's not the first girl to disappear from here mysteriously. What do you mean? Never mind. Callie, If you know something, anything, tell me. Please. There's been at least one other girl that they said ran away who was also pregnant. What was her name? Misty. Misty Miller. She lived here two years ago, and then one day I walked in on her. She had an envelope with a lot of cash. A lot. And not soon after, she was just gone. I never found out what happened to her or her baby but I think Rachel knows something about it. Rachel: Callie! Callie, do you think you could help Mrs. Hill in the kitchen for dinner? Now, please. Everything OK, Vanesha? Yeah. Nicolette? Yeah! I'm your ride. Hop in! Why are we stopping? Uh, sorry. One of the tires is acting funny. I'm gonna go check it out. What are you doing? I'm so sorry about this situation, Nicolette. But unfortunately, you left me with no alternative. Where am I? What is, what is this place? Shhh. It's a temporary home until I can make arrangements for more permanent accommodations... a long way from here. Jake! What are you doing here? I came to see Nicolette. - Yeah? Just wanted to make sure she's OK.. Well, she hasn't come back yet, even though she texted me last night and said she was on her way. That's weird. Yeah. Where the hell is she? This is bad. I feel it in my bones. Where are you going? I'm trying to track down this other girl. She used to live here, and she was pregnant too. Just like Brooke, one day she wasn't here anymore. It's a longshot but I think I know where she works. Can I come with you? I got-I mean, I can drive. Sure. - Great. -We can call the hospital too, see if they know anything about Nicolette. Hey. It's Nicolette. Leave a message. Uh, hi, Nicolette. It's Ms. Ridling. I just wanted to see how you're feeling today. Send me a message when you get a sec. When I get out of this bed, I swear! Who are you, really? Are you in this with Rachel? Did you have something to do with Brooke and her baby? Tell me! Brooke tried to back out of a agreement we had and became a complication. That's true. What did you do with her baby? Where is it? Living happily with a wonderful, advantaged couple who paid a handsome price. In fact... I'm certain I'm going to get the same for yours. Hey. Do you have a second to chat? I am having a day. I think I like overheated, uh, the milk for a cappuccino or something and it exploded everywhere and... I'm gonna call you back in about five minutes. Can I help you guys? Are you Misty Miller? Why? Who are you two? I live at A Path Ahead Group Home. I heard you used to live there too. You were pregnant but then you left and never came back. I don't know what you're talking... Please! One of our friends, Brooke, disappeared and now she's dead. And one of our other friends is pregnant and she just went missing too. We're just worried for her. Look, I'm sorry. I got nothing to say. Please! OK. Anything you say will help. We already lost one friend. We can't lose another. -Anything at all. Don't trust Rachel. I needed cash at the time, so I went with it. Be careful of Abigail. You know, Nicolette did mention something about a lady from an adoption center who came by. Is that... Yeah. Abigail runs the agency that Rachel referred me to. Like I said, I got my cash, and I just went on with my business. But I've heard that some of the other girls, they don't have a good experience with her. Please. That is all I can say. I am begging you. Do not come back here and talk to me about this. Hi! I'm looking for Nicolette. Oh, she's not here. Oh, uh, I was just worried about Nicolette. When I saw her at the hospital again yesterday You saw her again at the hospital? Yes, and she said she was coming back here last night, and she had a ride scheduled. Well, she didn't come back here. I don't understand. How can you not know where she is? She was supposed to call me to come pick her up. Let me call the hospital again and get more information. And what else can we do? Try not to worry. I'm sure she'll be back any minute. Nicolette has a mind of her own. What are you not telling me? Nicolette told me that you set her up with the contact at the adoption agency. Is that normal protocol for your job? And that woman was here the night I dropped off some things for Nicolette. Perhaps this contact knows where Nicolette is right now. I have no idea what you could possibly be referring to, and I'm going to have to ask you to leave now. Vanesha: Ms. Ridling, what are you doing here? I came to check on Nicolette but she's not here. Have you talked to her? No, not since she told me she was coming home and didn't. That's worrisome. Uh, what are you kids doing now? We just met somebody who was pregnant and left the group home a few years back. All she would tell us was not to trust Rachel and this woman Abigail, who she got referred to for adoption options. And Nicolette told me that the name of the agency was Loving Arms. I think I met that woman when I stopped by the other day. And Rachel is hiding something. I'm 100% sure. She's very on edge. Maybe what happened to your friend Brooke and Nicolette are... -Are connected. Yeah. OK. I'm gonna look up the address for this agency and go there in person. I will get this Abigail woman to talk to me. Well, can we do anything now or? Why don't you go talk to Detective Holmes about your suspicions? I mean, we don't have anything concrete yet but maybe we can do some digging into Rachel and this Abigail at the agency. I'm scared for Nicolette now. Maybe we'll get lucky; she'll turn up on her own. You need to eat and stay hydrated. You have a long journey ahead of you. What the hell are you people gonna do with me? Calm down. It's important for the baby. It's hard to stay calm when you're strapped to a bed against your will! Don't worry. We'll take care of you. And what are you gonna do with me after the baby's born? Eat. Hi. May I help you? Hi. Uh, we met at the home where my student Nicolette lives. Oh, yes! Nicolette. Uh, what is this concerning? I'm sorry. I'm a little confused as to why you're here. Oh, uh, Nicolette didn't make it back to the home last night from the hospital. Oh! I, I don't know anything about that. Have you helped set up adoptions for other girls at the agency? Oh, well, a, a couple. Sometimes young women who need guidance. I'm sorry, but I'm going to be late for an appointment. Fine. Thank you for your time. Dammit. Let's just see where you're headed to next. Abigail: Alex, listen carefully. We need to move our guest to a new location before our partners come for the pickup. Too many people are asking questions. Why in God's name are you in this part of town? Uh, hi, Mark. Hey, babe. How are things going? Can I call you back later? Everything OK? You sound stressed. No, everything's OK. It's just been a day. I'll call you back later. OK. Detective Holmes: Now, you're saying Nicolette never came back to the home from the hospital. -Right. I even called the hospital, and the nurse told me that she was released last night. Look, there have been suspicions regarding both your group home manager and the adoption agency. Brooke, Misty, and now Nicolette are all tied to this Abigail person. I'm gonna talk to Rachel Medford as soon as possible. Believe me, I wanna find out what happened to your friend as badly as you do. Please. Wha...? Sandy: What is this place! What the hell? Are you following me? Tell me where Nicolette is! Holmes here. Hi. This is Sandy Ridling. We met yesterday at the hospital. - Nicolette's teacher. - Yes. um... something big is happening. I'm not sure. -Mrs. Ridling, take a deep breath and tell me what's happening. -OK. I followed the woman that the girls were sent to as an adoption contact to some rundown location downtown. -Wait? What? -This woman, Abigail, attacked me when I confronted her, but I pepper-sprayed her. I think this is where Nicolette is being held or something. -Tell me where you're at exactly. -I'm at 141 State Street. I'm gonna go inside the building to see if I can... -Do not go inside anywhere! You hear me? I'm sending help right now! -Please hurry! Get cars to 141 State Street. Possible one-thirty-four in progress. We got a huge break in the Summers case. Abigail! Are you OK? Never mind me! Just go in there and stop that woman from getting Nicolette out! Sandy: Nicolette? Are you here? Yeah! I'm in here! Help me! Oh my.. Oh, my God! How did you find me? Talk about that later. OK. We, we have to get out of here. There are people that are gonna come and take me to a different country, like God knows where! OK. OK. Police are on their way. Uh, are you hurt? I think I'm OK. I just I'm really I'm scared out of my mind. We're gonna get you out of here, OK? OK? Alex: Step away from the girl! What is this for? Tape up her hands. I'm not gonna do that. I'm not just gonna stay here like a sitting duck. What's taking you so long? I'm, I'm, I'm trying! I'm just really nervous. Hurry up! Abigail: Alex! Come on! Come on! Let's go! This is over! Hey. It's legal and official! We're a big family now. The judge signed off on it. Congrats. I'm really happy for you guys. I still can't believe that I get to call Mark and Sandy my parents. We're the lucky ones. I'll second that. I really appreciate you looking after Michael while we were at the courthouse. It's no problem at all. I mean, I said I wanted to be a part of his life, right? And, well, it took me a while to get acquainted to it, but now I'm all in, Did you tell Jake the other big news? Wait! Have you been holding out on me? I've been accepted to the college of my choice, so I'll be heading there in the fall, but I get to stay here at home. That's amazing. So we can just be with our new forever family. And to think, this time last year, we were worried that we wouldn't have a family of our own. And now We're blessed, many times over. Mommy's sweet little boy. Oh! Oh, it's Vanesha! I'll be right back. Hey! I was just gonna call you. How'd it go today? He's so strong! It's official. And you? My aunt's been approved to be my legal guardian! Looks like we're both finally home. -I'm so happy for you. I'll call you later. I know! It's really coming together. Ohh! Look who's here.
