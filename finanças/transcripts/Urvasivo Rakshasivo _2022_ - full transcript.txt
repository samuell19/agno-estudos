Our son has been missing since the last three days, sir. Your son? What's his age? 27 years old 27 ? Boys in that age don't go missing, sir. He must have eloped. Give me the details. What is his name? Sree Kumar. What's the star sign of the groom? The star sign is Aquarius, the star is Gamma Aquarii. Okay. Dear. This girl is very beautiful, right? Dear... Ask her if she's married. Hey! Stop it. Dear. Will you ask or shall I go ahead? I'll ask her when we leave. How much salary are you expecting from the bride? Goodness. The bride doesn't have to do any job. My son is earning. The bride should be beautiful. She must know how to cook. She must know how to do household chores. She should be looking after the groom well. We don't want any of these modern women. Sure, Ma'am. Okay, Ma'am. Your registration is complete. You'll get your ID and password in the reception. Pay the bill and take them. Sure, Dear. Okay. Dear... Dear... Dear. Are you married, Dear? Yes. It was a love marriage. I guess your hair is still wet. You'll get sick with a cold, dry your hair properly again. Sure, Mom. Mom, why are these Idlis green in colour? You are not eating any dishes made with leafy veggies. That's why I mixed them with the batter. Have them. And you always stare at the computer screen. It's good for your eyes. Have them. The taste stays the same. Have them, Dear. The time now is still 7:45 am? The clock ran out of the batteries. I need to refill. Oh no! The time is 8:30 am! Hey! Have your breakfast and go. Hey, hey, hey! Stop there! Your shoes! Shoe? Damn! What's this? Why are you putting them in the bag? I'll wear them on my way somewhere. I'm... I'm sorry, Sister. I'm sorry, Sister. Sister? Good morning, Sree sir. Good morning, Sister Shanti. I was late today. "I want to tell you your story, Butterfly." "Even though it’s your story, you don’t know it." "Do you know that there’s a heart waiting to meet you?" "You are the firefly that shines in the daylight." "You always fly around." "Do you know that you take my heart along with you?" "If I wake up after dreaming about you, do you know how colourful my eyes become?" "To be with you together on a journey, do you know that a heart is waiting?" "These are the things you don’t know." What is so interesting there? Well, it's nothing, Sir. What about the issues? Have you fixed all the bugs? - Yes, Sir. There are no roadblocks, right? No, sir. What about the code review, then? Actually I sent Satish for that, Sir. Satish? Where is he? Hey Satish? -Who the hell is that? Come here! -Sir! Why is he calling? Sir? You called me? Satish. -Yes, Sir. Have you reviewed the code? -Yes, Sir. Show me. Well, it's in the process, Sir. Is it done or is it being done? It's almost done, Sir. At any cost, we must raise the release request by the evening. Sure, Sir. Please make sure that it's sent. -Yes, yes, yes. Yes, Sir. Yes. Hey! What's this? You said it was already done last evening? If I tell him that it's already done, he'll assign me a new task. There's a new series launched on Netflix. I still need to watch the remaining 4 episodes of it. I need to complete watching them by this evening. Please give me the credentials of your Netflix account. Hey! I will not give you. At least your Hotstar account? Hey! I will not give you. Give me your Amazon Prime account credentials at least. Do you want my Orkut account? You have no helping nature at all. I'll talk with John snow and send you to those white walkers to get rid of you. Damn! "My eyes are the windows on which you come and land." "Looking at you, my eyelids never blink." "My lips always wait to have a word with you." "But the moment you appear, I become mute." 'My dear, if you see me just by thinking something," "My world turns upside down." "If I see you smile, I celebrate that day." "I want to tell you your story, Butterfly." "Even though it’s your story, you don’t know it." "Do you know that there’s a heart waiting to meet you?" How dare you spoil the mind of my daughter? (On TV) I'll kill you. (On TV) Ask them to stop, dad. (On TV) Hey, Sree! Hey! Come here. Wait, Mom! I hate sad endings. What Mom? Take this and give it to Uncle Chitti. Ask him to do hemming for this. Okay. Sree. I kept money in the cupboard. Bring my hypertension medicines and a mosquito repellent liquid while you return with that money. Okay. Yes! You made it, Kohli! This time the cup is ours. Hey, Chittibabu! What's this? What the hell is this? Will anyone call this a blouse? There's nothing here. There are only 2 threads. This is a designer blouse, Venkatrao. The area of the cloth will be less. Exposing matters here. Hell with the exposing. -Shut up! Your neighbour Murali liked this blouse. Sridhar, who lives in your lane, liked it. The shopkeeper Shiva even posted the photos of it on instagram. Every guy in this area even liked those photos. If you don't like it, that means your wife has a very bad taste. If you stitch a blouse like this again, I'll stitch up your face. Idiot! He's unable to understand my talent like how his wife did. He lacks creativity. What's wrong, Uncle? When we do something new, some people like it and a person might not like it. This is that guy. RCB will definitely win someday. Likewise, won't I become a designer tailor? You are right, Uncle. Did you just blush by seeing her from afar today, too? Or have you talked with her? No. How long are you going to be like this? It's been 4 months already. Actually, she's in a different office, Uncle. I would've talked with her, if she's in my office. Back then a guy like you said that the bat was not good just because he can't play. How should you deal with a woman? How, Uncle? You need to step into the ground. You need to score sixes and fours super fast. And come home with the cup. If you do the delay like this, your mother will bring a girl someday and tell you that she's her daughter-in-law. Your expression is great! Hide it. You can use it in the future. I'll talk to her tomorrow. That's the spirit, Dear! All the best! Thanks, Uncle. -Kill it. That's cool. Hey! Did somebody just fall down? I'll see you again. Wow! she's great! Who's she? She joined recently. Shravan left last month. Our manager appointed this girl as his replacement. Who's that? Last night someone told me that he would do something if she's in the same office. Start it. Okay. Bye. -See you. This is my ID card, Sir. I'm taking it. Bye, Sir. What's this? Satish! Have these biscuits. Have them, come on. Satish. I think you need pins. Come on, show me your hands. Use it similarly, this property belongs to the company. Mr. Satish! -Yes. You have pins. But you don't have a brain. Where's the stapler? Well the stapler is... Here is the stapler. Take it. Hello! Use it sometimes. Okay? Are you referring to the stapler or the brain? Satish! Come here. What's this, Satish? It's very symptomatic. Asymptomatic? It's outrageous. It's completely wrong. Go debug it and come back to me. Sir, it is... -Out! He's talking too much in English. We have to debar such people from the software industry. Attempt number 74. It's a flop. No. It's a disaster. Cut it, cut it! Stop the music. It's not like that. Watch me. It smells good, Honey. -Thank you, Dad. You wanna try some It's quite hot, careful... How is it? Yummy! It's my own recipe, dad. Fabulous! My restaurant should serve only my authentic recipes, dad. Nice! Actually, very good idea. How is your restaurant plan shaping up? It takes time, dad. It's Paris. So, I need more savings. Honey... I am ready to invest in it. Why are you wasting your time? Dad, you know me. This is my dream and I must start it with my own earnings. You never listen to me. Anyway, it's your decision Stubborn girl! Give me 10 minutes. I'll have a shower and come. Sure! All the things you did yesterday were for this girl, right? You are right. Satish. Please let's exchange our seats. You bought this phone on EMI, right? Yes. How many do you still have to pay? On the phone? I guess there are 4 months left. What about the bike? On the bike? Oh my god! Still I have 8 EMIs to pay. A guy who has to pay EMI for so many things, should never think about girl. Did you see how she is? She only drinks coffee from Starbucks. She goes for trekking, pedicures and parties for the weekend. What about our weekend? We always wait to eat peanut Chikkis. And we wait for our mother to make us chilli fritters. Or we just play cricket with the kids in our lane. If it's something more, we just get on our terrace to sing and dance. (Singing song) Do we need this? If you say no and want to go ahead with this and get affected, it's your wish. Go and sit. Hi, Little one. Hi, Cutie. Hello. Is that a male or female? Know about the gender first. Why do you name them already? You are calling it, Little one and Cutie. Is it a male or female? Oh my god! I think that will do. Where is it? Oh no! What's wrong? Satish, I can't seem to find the tortoise. Why did you take that out? You were the one who asked me about the gender of it. Do you have to take it out to know about it? Stop your lecture and help me. Before she comes. The size of tortoise is this much. Where is it? Hey! What are you doing? -Shh! It's in this size. Are you crazy? I was about to say that a tortoise of this size went missing. Can't you wait? Hey! Get lost! Waste fellow. You all have dirty minds. Okay, bye. Satish. I found it. Thank god. You can leave us. Satish was supposed to be here, right? Well, Satish changed his seat actually. What about you? Myself Sree. Well, It's Sree Kumar. Hi! I'm Sindhu. Sindhuja. Are we on the same team? Yes. Are you working for the inventory module? Yes... Yes. What's your contact number? What? Your phone number. What's this? Why is your face glowing? What dear? She took my phone number. Is it? She took the phone numbers from the whole team. You are the last one. Damn. Poor fellow. She gave you her number. What are you waiting for? Call her. -Call her? Yes, call her. They say ladies are first in everything. But gents should be the first one to take the initiative. You are listening to him. Be careful, Sree. You go ahead. What should I talk about after calling her? I'll tell you, follow me. She's not answering, Uncle. They are girls, so they won't answer. They'll think that we'll know that they are idle if they answer immediately. She'll call you back after some time. Uncle, she's calling. Hello? -Hello. Hello. just called you back after seeing your missed call. I was busy earlier. Ask her what she's doing. What are you doing? Did you not hear it? I just finished my dinner and called you after coming into my room. Have you had your dinner? Have you had your dinner? Can't you hear? I'm thinking of watching IPL after having my dinner. Are you not watching any IPL matches? Are you not watching any IPL matches? Is there someone by your side? What do you mean? There's no one by my side. I guess it's the echo. All the networks are like this lately. (It was a nice talking to you) [Blouse size 36, length 13 Waist length size 28] Your blouse size 36 I mean 26, it's 26. January 26th. Well on the account of republic day, I used to participate in the singing competition and win. (Singing Errajenda song) Uncle, help with the lyrics. -Stop it. Just like this, I used to sing songs with social values and impress everyone. Ms. Sindhu, What's your favourite dish? It's brinjal. Brinjal, it seems. Tell her, "I like it, too.". My Uncle Chitti likes brinjal as well. -Damn. Hey! Hey! Uncle! I'm trying so hard here to make you work things out. But you are unable to follow me. You'll definitely fail if you are like this. Get lost. Hello! Hi! Hi, Sree! Where are you? Well, I'm on my way to the office. My dad took my car today. Oh, you'll come on the company bus today? Could you please pick me up? Yeah, yeah. Sure. Definitely. Thanks. Where's the water? Uncle! Can I take this water? If I walk seven steps with Sindhu before she crosses that glass door, she's my partner for life. One... Two... Three... Four... Five... Six... Seve... Hi! It's yoga. Yeah. Why did you get stuck like a video that buffers? Come on. I'll come, you go ahead. Why? Should Deepika Padukone come and invite you personally? Come with me. Hey! Hey! What's wrong, Sree? I got leg cramps. You go ahead. Come on. Just leave. Just go. What's wrong Sree? Bye. Seven... Aunt! Saroja's daughter-in-law won't wear night-gowns at night it seems. She'll be in her shorts at home it seems. Goodness gracious. She frequents the beauty parlour it seems. She'll do something to her eyes it seems. She'll have her hands waxed it seems. If a girl like her becomes by daughter-in-law I can never stay in the same house as her for a second. Mom! The phone is dying. Hang up the call. Okay, Aunt. I'll call you tomorrow. Bye. Here is your phone. Mom! I got two missed calls. You should have noticed it. Was it from your office? Actually, it's more important than that. The subscriber you are calling is switched off. Please try after some time. Hi, Sindhu... ja. Hi! You called me yesterday. I was busy. Was it something important? It's nothing. I am thinking of going to a party this weekend. I called to invite you. But that's okay. Satish said he'll come. Which Satish? That guy. If I touch you I'll get goosebumps. You'll get tickles. It's tickling.. It's tickling No, you'll beat me. Hey Sathish, you are so naughty Hey! Hey! Hey! What did I do? Why did you answer the call? Why did you not answer it? I was busy. I was not busy. When a girl invites you, you should reject her. Which guy will reject when a girl invites him to the pub? Satish! Please! I'll beg you. Tell her that you won't come to the pub. Okay, I need ALTBalaji app subscription Take my Aha credentials - I watched all the videos in Aha A new series called Gandi Baat has been released on ALTBalaji Seems reviews are bad but the content is good Okay. Promise? Okay, promise. Hi, Sindhu! Hi, Satish! I can't come to the party tomorrow. Come on, it'll be fun. I need to watch a series. I really want to binge watch it in one sitting. What series? -Gandii Baat What? No.. no.. no... Mandhi ke bath Digestion and metabolism techniques Especially, while we eating mutton... Let's not go to details. You go with someone else. Someone else. Yeah, okay. Thank you. Get lost. Why is she not inviting me to the party? Sree. I'm ready. For what? I mean, you called me. I emailed you the review of the data. Check it out. Okay. Are you free in the evening tomorrow? Shall we go to a party? If it's in the evening... Don't play hard-to-get. You'll lose the chance. Yeah, sure. Where do you usually hang out on the weekends? Super! Why mention about my weekends? You go ahead. Okay, I'll let you know. Did he come to a pub or to some award ceremony? No, they probably are not talking about me. Are you here for a magic show? What kind of costume is this? Don't tell me you'll suddenly pull out pigeons from your pocket. Ms. Sindhu! This was designed by my Uncle Chitti. Let's go. The guy who would steal this should get paralyzed. Hey! -Hi! Hey! People here wear very short dresses. Don't worry. Now, go to the girl, looking manly and say this. Hey! Get lost! Can I buy you a drink? Say this confidently. She'll order the drinks. You pay the bill. And the waiter will give you the change. And like a hero, with the waiter you'll say 'Keep the change.' Okay. What will you say? Keep the change! It's not like that. Keep the... Keep the change. Yes. Go and kill it. Can I... buy you a drink? We came here together. Why are you asking me like that as you were asking some chick you newly met in the pub? Still, it's okay... Can I buy you a drink? One vodka shot. Okay, Ma'am. What about you? Order some juice for me. Juice? Okay. One Mojito mocktail. Make sure it's chill. Your drinks, Ma'am. Keep the change. Sir? Keep the change, Man. You should pay me, Sir. He can't make it. Keep the change, Sir. Talk about something. Well, I was born and brought up in Hyderabad. I studied in HMC school. I studied in St.Mary college... -What? What's your sun sign? -It's leo. I guessed it already. I can't get along with Leo well. That's in english. In Telugu it's Aquaris. What's your sun sign? I don't know. What's your date of birth? -I have no idea. What do you mean by that? I can only know, if my dad tells me. He doesn't even know his own birthday. Only my mom knows when I was born. She passed away when I was little. Oh! I'm sorry for your loss. It's okay. Let's dance. Don't say no like a kid and drink it as a whole. Oh no! Please. Are you going to have it or not? I can't. You can ask me something else. Oh! Would you do anything? Look. It's that pink-haired guy. It's bloody party time. Baby, check it out. Go and throw the drink in his hand in his face. No. We'll get into a fight. -Are you afraid? Come on, Bro. Brother! -What? I'm sorry, Bro. Why are you apologising? I'm sorry, Bro. -Hey! I beg you, please forgive me. -I'll break your limbs. Catch him! -Hey, stop! Stop there! Sister, Sister! Please move aside. Hey! Stop there! Oh no! Please don't shout. They'll hear you. Not bad You did it. I did it for you. -Oh? Will you do anything I say? I'll do it even if you don't say. The counter was good. -Oh no! I'm being serious. Call me Sindhu from now on. Okay. Call me now. Sindhu. Call me again. Sindhu. Can I tell you something? I... like... you. "When my eyes dreamed once upon a time, it became true now like a striking lightning." "When my breath was in the same rhythm as her’s, I felt elated." "Oh dear! My heart is pounding. You are the reason behind it." "Who disturbed me like this? I’m feeling this in me for the first time." "I don’t know why I feel longing and hesitation at the same time." "I don’t know why I’m hiding myself as a habit." "Your looks towards me made this magic." "I left myself and met you." "Your looks towards me made this magic." "I left myself and met you." Tortoise looks to be hard But they are very sensible inside "I’ll be the footprints that are left behind you, in every place you travel." "I’ll listen to my name that comes out of your mouth." "I feel elated just by your touch!" "Time brought us together because we look good together as a pair." "My heart wants to be together with you." "Everything is helping us to become one." "Your looks towards me made this magic." "I left myself and met you." "The sky itself will become the rain and shower on us." "The sound of the thunder and the silence in my heart are becoming the processional song." "I sent messages in my language." "There are many feelings in my imagination that I can’t put into words." "Silence will teach me how to talk in this love." "Your looks towards me made this magic." "I left myself and met you." She is looking nice, right? -No mom. Look at this girl's photo - No mom. Hey, Honey! Who's this guy? Daddy, he's my colleague. He's a good guy. Very interesting character! If you meet him, I'm sure you'd like him. I'm free today. Let's meet him. Are you sure, dad? Yeah. Hi, Sindhu. Hey, my dad wants to meet you. Can you show up in the evening? Okay. Okay, then. Meet me at 6 'o'clock. Bye. Okay. Bye. Dad, here's your carriage. Setu, I'm going. Hey, Sree… Dad! Are you in love? N…No, dad. You know very well about your mother. The only thing she ever desired is to conduct your marriage as per her wish. Poor thing! She always tells me that since she's not well, she feels that she should find a girl who would take care of you as she does. She is that anxious about your marriage! Don't hurt her feelings due to petty nuisances like girlfriends, and love and all. I wanted to make this clear to you. So I did. Son! Are you hungry? Shall I get something to eat? Sindhu! Sorry, I couldn't make it yesterday. Sindhu! Sindhu… You may go. It's okay. I'll stay. It'll take another half an hour for me to leave. That's okay. It's about rain. I'll wait here. Stop, stop, stop! What? I have itching in my throat. Can you get me a halls cough drop? Okay Also, you may get something for yourself too. For myself? Here. Didn't you get anything for yourself? No! My dad isn't home today, There is no issue.. if you leave late. You may get something for yourself if you want it. What would I find here? Actually… I need to get some idlis, I'll get it after dropping you home. Come, let's go. Hey! One minute, just a minute. Don't shut. -Brother, please don't shut. -I'm done for the day. -Just one minute. -I'm already too late. -Please, brother. I beg you. -It's about to rain. Hey, what are you doing? -I beg you. Please, let me in. Can't you understand? It's too late already. I might not find a more special occasion than this. I love you! What? I love you, Sindhu! Don't fool with me, Sree. What's wrong? I thought we're just friends. Just friends? But I'm in love with you. Actually, I've been following you since before you joined this office. Oh, shit! Shit? I don't understand. Then, what was this? This was just a casual fling that happened in the heat of the moment. A casual fling? But I love you, Sindhu. Stop saying that, Sree. I don't love you. Sindhu. Please... I'll take good care of you. I won't ever scold you. I'd defend you from every problem. Please try to understand, Sindhu. Please, Sindhu. Sree, look here. Stop crying. You're a very good guy. I like you a lot. I feel very comfortable with you. But… There's no love, Sree. Then why did you said that in the pub? I don't get you. What did I say? When we were in the washroom, didn't you say that you like me? Tell me, Sindhu. I was about to say that I like your innocence. Okay, let's talk like adults. We definitely crossed our boundaries. But this isn't a big deal. This shouldn't ruin our friendship. We can still be good friends, Sree. Sree! Please go after the rain subsides. Ew! What kind of girl is she? She did everything and how dare is she to ask to be just friends? She used you by seducing you with her beauty. She cheated you! She is the unlucky one to have rejected your true love; why do you cry for her? Stop crying. Okay, uncle. I'll leave. But she's a good girl, uncle. Why did you come home drenched in rain? Couldn't you take some shelter for some time? Now you'll get sick. Let the bygones be bygones. Forget that girl and marry someone who your mother approves of. Hi Sindhu! Hi! I got you, honey! Stupid. What, honey? You lost so easily? What happened, honey? You look disturbed. When you were out of town, I brought Sree home. First time in my life, I feel like I made a mistake. I thought it was just casual, dad. But he said, he loves me. Then? What about you? Don't you love him? No, dad. I didn't think that it would hurt him so much. Honey... you have grown up in America. The culture there, your college, and your friends' circle must have conditioned you into a broad-minded person but the mentality of a middle-class boy who has been born and brought up here would be completely different. Just a smile from a girl is enough for them to assume that they're soulmates. And when such guys get an unexpected answer from the girl they loved, they take it deeply into their hearts and it disturbs them a lot. By the way, in that series everything was told. Yeah, yeah.. it's fantastic. Why are you mixing this? What? Why are you cracking the April 1st's joke on December 31st? Breakup? What breakup? Take care, you must be high! Hello! Hello! Are you serious? What? We are not compatible? What the hell is compatibility? If you call us to be incompatible that means you must have moved on with someone else. Hello? Hello? You, bloody… Oh God! My phone. bloody… Bro… What happened? That girl used me for one whole year and now calls for a breakup, bro. I could have bought an acre of land in my village had I not spent on her shopping. All girls are the same, bro. They have grown used to international content and thus neglecting the local OTT apps. Bring the bottle. Come here. Have it. Hey, not a whole lot Leave me some "Don't stalk the girls, my friend. They'll make a fool out of you." "Why is that? Why? Why? What is the reason?" "Don't fall for their smile. Your life will become like the goods train." "Why is that? Why? Why? What is the reason?" "She will look out only for her needs and then easily break apart." "But the boy would be lingering at the bar." "It's an illusion!" "These girls create an illusion around us!" "We will only get hurt if we deal with them." "It's an illusion!" "These girls create an illusion around us!" "Illusion! Illusion!" "The whole life is gone in vain!" "Illusion! Illusion!" "The whole life is gone in vain!" "Don't stalk the girls, my friend. They'll make a fool out of you." "Why is that? Why? Why? What is the reason?" "Don't fall for their smile. Your life will become like the goods train." "Why is that? Why? Why? What is the reason?" "If you get tangled with girls, your life will turn out to be a roller coaster. " "She will torture you, make you go crazy and make your life hell. " "Let their phones get blocked. Let their accounts be hacked." "Shopping mall get locked and ban them from entering the pubs." "Let their makeup kits get lost." "Let the beauty parlours be shut forever. We, boys, curse you girls that you lose all your hair." "May you be reborn as boys in your next life." Hey guys, it's countdown time 10... 9... 8... 7... 6... 5... 4... 3... 2... 1... HAPPY NEW YEAR! Is this casual too? Madam is okay with everything. Do you understand everything? Every-thing! But that is not love, it's just casual. It might not be a big deal for you but it is for me. My parents didn't grew me up like you. I must be punished for loving you…. Wait, you hit me. It's okay, hit me. This is casual too, hit me. Oh shit! Yes, that was casual for me. By the way, if you had had an orthodox upbringing like you claim to be, you wouldn't have revealed our private matter in public. If you believe that I have a cheap character then why did fall in love with me in the first place? Didn't he tell that I did everything? What is that every-thing? Just sex? You can't even utter that word. That is your maturity level. Sex might be big deal for you but for me... love is bigger than that. Since you proposed your love... I started thinking about you. I realised... I am in love with you. But hear me out clearly… Hate you! Sindhu! Sindhu! Sree! A young man who was upset over a dispute with his girlfriend committed suicide created a stir in Hyderabad. He made a suicide note that asks his parents to excuse and committed suicide Damn! This generation's boys are unbelievable. How easily they fall in love and if they face failure in that... with the similar ease they give up on their lives. They have no value for life! Is your son... A love failure? Did you find out anything? He has not gone to any of his friends either. What did they say here? We have filed the complaint. CI is on the way, they have asked us to wait. Chitti, doesn't he share all his problems with you? Why hasn't he informed you anything this time? What are you doing? When he is getting sloshed? Why didn't you stop him? I'm drinking as well. You both have spoiled him. -What are you talking? I do drink but have you ever seen me this sloshed? Good for you! Give... Have some. A woman has all the patience in this world... but she cannot tolerate the disrespectful treatment from her loved one, Sree. It's all my fault, sister. I didn't understand her love. I apologise to her tomorrow in the office. In the office? Do you think she will come to the office after all that has happened? No way. Good morning, guys. Hi, Satish. Sindhu! Actually… Weren't you supposed to apologise? Why are you behaving so sheepish? What is that paper? -Nothing. What is that? I have prepared a speech as I might go blank in front of her. You have prepared a speech? My dear! Let me see what you have written. Yesterday at the party, I spoke very cheaply about you in front of everyone. Forgive me, Sindhu. I had consumed alcohol for the first time in my life. That's why I had lost control over myself. I have not been myself the whole night. I have been having ruminating thoughts about you… Ruminating thoughts? Rumination! Are people still using this word? Damn! She is as trendy as the K-dramas and you are writing full-page dialogues like in Indian daily soaps? Actually… -To hell with your actually. I'll go and speak to her. Watch and learn. Hi, Sindhu. You are looking great today. See, Sindhu. It happens! Life is a series of web series. You might like some episodes and might dislike some. But do we stop watching the series because we didn't like one episode? No, right? Sindhu, do you know one thing? Life is all about moving on. Get lost, you waste fellow! -Sorry? Get lost, you waste fellow! How was it, Satish? It's a little too hot, sir. Be careful. What happened? Bro… Karthika Deepam is a wonderful series, bro. Vantalakka is the best character I have ever seen. What are you talking about? Doctor Babu and Vantalakka haven't united yet. Before their unification, how can you both unite? It's a crime. How long will it take to get that file? Get it fast. What is this, sir? -I'll get it, sir. Leave it, sir. Sindhu. What? Well… What is it? Sindhu, I had consumed alcohol for the first time. So it triggered my emotions. I know, it's wrong to reveal our private issues in public. I was about to ask sorry but actually… Remove actually from your vocabulary. I'll hear you then. Sindhu... I had consumed alcohol for the first time. So it triggered my emotions. I know, it's wrong to reveal our private issues in public. Actually, I was about to ask sorry but… Sindhu… Sindhu… Poor guy. He's been beseeching you for the last three days. Why don't you talk to him? Boys look very cute when they beseech, don't they? All girls are psychos, aren't they? Hey! What the… She is the Mirzapur batch! Sindhu! Sindhu! Sindhu! Sorry, Sindhu. Sindhu, sorry. Actually... I want to go on a holiday with you. What say? What? A holiday? But to where? Sindhu! Shall we take our relationship to the next level? Yeah. I was thinking about the same thing. Like, we both coming to the office together. Like, in the evening instead of you going to your home and me going to my home… …we both going to our house. Like, staying together 24hrs. Like this! -Live-in? -Marriage? Did you say marriage? -Did you say live-in? Why live-in, Sindhu? I was suggesting we both could get married and move to a house. Why do we need to get married to live in the same house? We can instead live-in. Sindhu... my mother is looking for matches for me. Let's convince them and get married. Stop it, Sree. Why do you want to hurry the marriage? Let's enjoy this love phase for some time. Let's get into live-in. Why do we have to get live-in in between, Sindhu? Just imagine, Sree. There will be only two of us in the live-in. We won't have any restrictions as we have in marriage. We would have complete freedom. We can understand each other in a much better way. That would make our love even stronger. Is it right to live together without being married? For two people to live together, they don't need marriage... all they need is love. Okay. Let me think about it. Answer positively soon. I'll be waiting for it. Live-in? Like Malinga's bowling, this girl too is beyond comprehension. Wow! The 1st season is about love and the 2nd season is about live-in. Very interesting! Don't take me wrong... but this is not right. Marriage is like a test match. You have to play patiently. But live-in is like T20, you can be as flamboyant as you want. Sir... I'd suggest you to say no. You would bear the entire expense in marriage... but in live-in, it's 50-50. What is your opinion on live-in relationships? Would you encourage it? If this falls in the dustbin, live-in. The match that came from Vizag have shown interest in our boy, aunty. Now it is up to us whether we say yes or not. Is it live-in? He has never said no to anything that I have asked of him, aunty. If I ask him to get married now, he will say yes immediately. Okay, aunty. I'll take your leave. Mom... do you know about live-in? Live-in? Live-in means a boy and a girl stay in the same house without getting married. But that is to understand each other better. Idiot! How did you get such filthy ideas? It's not me, mom. Satish told me. He is planning to get into a live-in relationship with a girl. He asked me for my opinion. How would I know anything about this, mom? Instead of getting married why did he decide to get into this filth? Let me find him, I'll teach him a good lesson. Sree! Sree! Where are you? Hi, Aunty. How are you? Hey, jasmine. These flowers seem very interesting, aunty. I'll pluck all of them and take them along with me but don't ask me the reason. Sree! Hey, Drumstick! Aunty, if you don't mind, I want to tell you something. While leaving, I would like to take a bunch of drumsticks and a basket full of jasmine flowers along with me. (Humming a song) What do you say? You, scoundrel! Aunty, I'm Satish. Do you want jasmine flowers? Jasmine flowers! Mom, stop it. Mom… Stop it, mom. Mom, leave him. -Don't interfere. Instead of getting married, you want to get involved in all this nasty business, do you? Mom, stop. Please stop it, mom. Wait! He wants Jasmine and drumsticks it seems! Scoundrel! Come here with me. Are they hybrid jasmine and imported drumsticks? The issue is not about flowers or vegetables. Then! Has she been nominated for the 'save the flowers' challenge? Actually… I told her that you are in a live-in with another girl. Yes, I will... Does that mean you made me a scapegoat? Please! -No. You have lost it, bro Check tomorrow's WhatsApp status. (What did you think?) Have you lost your mind? If mom and dad find out that you are in live-in with a girl, do you know how hurt they will be? Actually… Sindhu loves me a lot, sister. But she is not ready for marriage yet. So, I have a small glimmer of hope that if we stay together, I can convince her to get married. Your mom smashed the hell out of me thinking I'm in a live-in relationship. Imagine what will be your situation if she finds out about you. How are you going to manage now? Actually... There is a vacant penthouse two streets down from my home. I and Sindhu are renting it. That's
