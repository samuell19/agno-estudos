[Angela] So I can see that you're having some doubts about a financial investment that you were thinking of making... There's somebody here with you now she's smiling and looking at you. Am I right in thinking that your mother passed into spirit last year? I am right...Yes Well let me tell you... that she is here and she is blessing you and every decision that you make. [Karen] Angela Bennett  is a fraud she has no skills psychic or otherwise, I'm losing everything  [Angela is silent] because of her my life has turned upside down and it's all her fault. She can rot in hell ! you are deceitful and I am going to expose you so everybody can see what a fraud you are! Hi Terry... Yeah...hi Angela Good to see you again Just a shame it's not in person... yeah yeah um you got the keys all right? Yes...they arrived yesterday Great...great, what did you say you were a fortune teller? No...um i'm more of a medium so i see people and I can sense energies and... Right i get it you're one of those okay Yes I've had quite a few people contact me since the the.... Oh...the incident? Yeah, if you ask me he did a runner... Oh? Yeah of course he did a runner he just didn't want to pay his rent.. the footage online is proof surely ... yeah yeah the footage online look he faked it if you ask me he faked all of it just looked like some sort of school project you wouldn't believe the amount of crazy people I've had contacting me since this whole thing kicked off no offense... Did you get the money I sent you? Yes so I'll be moving back beginning of September...is there anything else you need? you got it all yeah yep great lovely all the best Angela Thank you Terry...thank you Bye...bye Okay! It is half an hour from here to there and there's no time like the present So let's get going! [Phone alert] Just about to set off...This is it! So I've just been looking at the fraud...Angela's Facebook page and it looks like she's been starting another bulls**t investigation something about a house in sherwood she says it's haunted it's in the papers about a year ago Something in the Nottingham post about the haunting...oh rubbish anyway it's not too far from here i think it's about 10 15 minute walk so I am going to find it! [Wind and traffic] That one..oh my God oh my God that's her...I'm sure that's her... Going in to the house for the first time! She's just going in...what a coincidence! That's crazy..! [Angela] Ooh it's quite dark... I'll put some lights on Heard the door go... Yeah... Alright...so first room, here we are...I guess this is the dining room..maybe? Here we are in the house in Sherwood What happened here? The Police still haven't found the two missing men apparently one of them hacked the home CCTV system and found footage of poltergeists paranormal activity and nocturnal sleep possession... many think the footage is fake... but i think it could be real and I'm going to find out for myself show everyone... [Phone alert] Oh what....? For goodness sake... that's crazy What...? this is ridiculous I think you can see anything out there actually but there's the view out there... I'm taking that oh my God I'm coming back later right This is the plan of action...first of all we're going to start with some weird phone calls which would be good and then we're going to move on to some poison pen letters my favorite after that we're going to do some good old-fashioned facebook and twitter abuse I set up some new accounts because well the last lot got shut down of the new bit some paranormal activity fake obviously...which we're gonna do in her house because now I have the key I know I can get in and then I can just sort of move stuff around I mean yeah I've seen enough of those investigations online and all her stupid ridiculous videos to know enough about what it's all about i can fake some ghost rubbish this is gonna be amazing! Right....calling Angela... [Phone vibrates] Hello? hello Angela speaking who is this? [Heavy breathing] Who is this? I think I know who this is... listen I think I know who you are...and if you are who I think you are... I am going to go back to the Police they are going to come round to your house and knock on your door is that what you want? Do you want the police to come around to your house you f**king psycho?! Oh I'm a psycho am I am I? Well this is a burner phone Angela so you can't prove it's me can you? [Angela] I thought this was finished? She makes my skin crawl I know it's her I can just tell...I need to calm down I am calm... [Laughs] I'm sure it's her I know it. She is a total nut case! It's going to take a lot more than that to frighten me believe me. This is where he slept... I am protected but if there are any energies in the house I want them to show themselves to me and i think this is the best place to be...okay My mother got sent a poison pen letter in fact if someone on her street wrote these poison pen letters and sent them to everyone on the street and my mother was so upset I thought it was brilliant I mean she was she thought it was awful obviously she said what kind of a person would do a thing like that?! Well...er...! [Laughs] Oh my God I love it okay look at this! We are going to explore the attic... We've not been up there yet so let's take a look...straight up these steep steps...here we are okay nice big room wow I've gotta turn this round check this out look at these...oh let's pull this back wow there is a load of puppets look at that I think I had some of these as a kid they always got tangled up but... yeah look at them they're pretty creepy right huh especially... that one! I wonder if they are valuable? anyway glad I'm not sleeping in this room So...Exciting things down here...I'll turn you around we have gas and electric by the looks of it oh let's go over here... different side empty side... it feels different down here there's definitely a different energy on this side yeah [Bang] Did you just... I just felt something brush past me! This is good...okay let's follow it That was really strong definite energy okay this is great really exciting Oh my God! Look at this! [Loud banging on door] [Angela] Oh my God Jesus Christ!!!! What...[More banging] Hello...hello? So as you just heard somebody was hammering on the door and when I've opened it there's nothing there... as you can see there's nobody down the street What...? Was that kids or was that part of the energy as well ? Look... at what's happened! It's empty...this is good...this is really good! So I've been exploring the cellar I think whatever is in there is trying to make contact with me but what I need to decide is what kind of spirit is it... Is it an Earthbound spirit ie: was once human...What...what's that noise? [Helicopter overhead] Hang on... [Helicopter] Just after that hearing that helicopter I just want to make sure... okay it's better to be safe...right and let's just check... I can't reach that one but the one up there is definitely locked and probably has never been opened! Okay...check the door... Yeah all good...bolts...Oh! so there's something on the floor! let's go through here so you can see it's a little bit dark So I've just found something on the floor I don't know how long it's been there... I'm going to open it and have a look if it's anything of interest... [Karen laughs] Oh my gosh she is gonna love that! What....Weird! What is it? Who's it for? Is it for me?! [Camera Clicks] I think there was something there... just stood in the entrance to the cellar it was very faint I think I can make it out Finish this last little bit here stick it all down...Check it out! Beep beep beep!!! She's gonna love it isn't she?!!! [Laughs] I wonder what she's doing at the moment...? First night here...I've had such an incredible day.. it was amazing seeing that figure in the sleeping bag I need to review that footage actually I've got said sleeping bag here I'm hoping that figure may be attracted to the sleeping bag and therefore show itself to me again tonight...okay good night and let's hope we get some more footage! okay it's like camping! Right...I am ready... Tucked up and... Okay... See you later. It's the middle of the night and I've just woken up can you see me? Because there was really really loud banging above me I don't want to turn the light on because I don't want to disturb whatever... whatever entity was making that noise It's stopped now... it could be the neighbours but it was definitely above me not to the side I just heard rustling just outside the bedroom... Oh my God the door has just opened the bedroom doors just swung right open and something... it looked heard like something just legged it! there's a sheet on the floor one of the empty dust sheets from one of the rooms downstairs I'll just show that quickly to you Okay...this is good! It's been an incredible, incredible day I don't think that the entity is going to show itself to me again tonight I think it's probably used up all its energy moving the sleeping bag and the dust sheets so I think I might have a quiet night... therefore I call upon my angels and my guardians to protect me to surround me with white light Goddess bless me Good night. I want to explain a little bit about why I'm doing what I'm doing Angela Bennett is a fraud plain and simple I was in a financially precarious time in my life I just lost my job and bills are piling up and I had to take a mortgage holiday and well I'd... just been offered some investment opportunities and I sought Angela's advice and i went to her for a reading well actually we met via Zoom she... she did advise me she advised me to to take the investment opportunities and well let's just say they were bad very bad I lost all my savings I lost everything i could i had to default on my mortgage I had taken a lodger to pay the bills I just... it was awful awful time in my life now you might say to yourself well this was my choice nobody was holding a gun to my head and well yes yes yes it was my choice but now this is the bit that makes me really mad she said...this is despicable she said my mother was watching over me she she said that my own mother was in the room with me...! helping me through this difficult time I mean how f**king low can you get... my mother my own dead mother I mean.... this is why Angela Bennett has it coming to her I mean... the letters the phone calls that's one thing but I'm going to make her pay I'm going to make her suffer I'm going to prove once and for all that she is a fraud I'm going to expose her for everyone to see him ruin her career ruin her life just like she's ruined mine... [Doorbell] I'm just gonna.... [Agent] Oh good morning are you Miss Keane? [Karen] No no, I'm her babysitter... [Agent] We have a warrant for this address...give her this, tell her we'll be back [Karen] Fine bye...bye...I'll pass it on thank you [Agent] Alright...have a good day... See what i'm dealing with? That was the f**king debt collectors... F**king hell! F**k you Angela! Hi everyone... Day two... I'm going to photograph the cellar because I'm hoping that whatever showed itself to me last night will show itself to me again down here [Camera clicks] ah this is this is brilliant this is so clear! The air's gone really really heavy I f there is a presence in this cellar i want you to show yourself to me I'm actually starting to feel a little bit headachy I feel really really groggy the energy is definitely affecting me So I'm just about to go outside and clear the fog away, hopefully get rid of that headache as well Apparently there is a local park about five minutes away so go there and get some fresh air Okay do not forget...and I've got it around my neck... Do not forget to your mask Angela! Okay here we are she's just leaving the house now she's just gone okay she's walking down the street There she goes...going around the corner... Okay she's gone! okay [Door creaks open] Okay..Poison pen letter... Could start in here... Move some things around... see what's in here Yeah we can definitely do... this is crazy let's do this... Okay i think that's that done there so now I just need to go and hide this... walkie-talkie so if we put this somewhere I think upstairs we can freak her out a bit more with some... ghostly voices in the night or some other such bollocks yeah up the top I think okay I reckon this is a good spot she shall hear it if I put in one of these wardrobes here okay it's got a couple of days worth of batteries I reckon say if I just put that there... perfect oh my God! What the f**k is that??? Even being out for just a.... few seconds makes me feel instantly better. Fresh air can do that for you can't it so I've got a new meditation that i thought when we get to the park I can show you I'll sit on a little bend and...oh Do you know what...I think I've left the oven on which is so typical of me but I'm not going to be able to relax unless I go back and check so let's go back... That is freaky as hell...let's have a look at it Look at that...! [Laughs] Oh my God... Okay that's done let's get back down... I think it's time to go I can't believe we've done it all... Right...here we go Right...how much do you bet that I have switched it off? Okay she's coming in, she's coming in!!! Oh my gosh where am I gonna... Door takes a bit of getting used to... My goodness! Look at this! Nothing was like this when I left, this is definitely... this is definite proof of paranormal poltergeist activity! if anything has moved up here so... Okay Let's have a quick look in here... No...nothing Aha! Okay let me turn this around... can you see? the blue sleeping bag I don't know why but it really likes moving that...funny! is that the front door? sounded like... sounded like the front door shutting no definitely locked... could've sworn I heard that... weird Look! that was not open before... that might be the actions of the entity from the cellar which makes me think that it might be stuck in the cellar and it wants to get out oh text message...'Terry can you check for a key under the mat as the previous tenants may have left one there' yes I can check for a key... no nothing there okay I'll text him back All right here we go she's Facebook... look at that...my handiwork! Oh my god I can't believe how many people are watching this at the moment like people fall for this s**t...! not for much longer! It's nearly seven o'clock and it's going to be dark soon so I'm just having a bite to eat today and yesterday have been such an amazing couple of days the footage I have got is the best footage I have ever captured there's things that move um there's pictures there's so much and the energy is obviously so strong here this is going to put me right back on the map I can feel it ! After I've eaten this pasta I 'm going to do a candle lit walk through of the house and see if anybody would like to join me! This is it it's gonna happen right switch the lights off... That one... put that there... Ah there we go...got it this is it it's gonna happen! Right okay And we're off! This is gonna be awesome! So I'm just about to do a candle-lit walk through... before I do that I'm just going to draw a circle of light and protection around myself... so I'm just gonna speak to my guides..okay I call upon my angels to protect me I call upon archangel Michael to walk with me and to keep me from any harm or negativity I ask the spirits to present yourselves to me so that I may help you Ready I'm not going to say anything as we do this walk through I'm just going to let you look and listen hopefully something may present itself to us either visually or aurally [Creaking] I can hear her moving around... Yeah she's definitely in, I can hear her... right i'm gonna start! [Mouths silently] Upstairs? See if this works, she's gone upstairs...okay [Switches Walkie-talkie on] Angela....Angela! Angela.... can you hear me Angela...? Oh my God... [Thumping] She's definitely heard something...! Is it working? Angelaaaa...[Beeps/crackle] Oh! What was that? It's beeping... Something wrong with it? [High pitched beeps] Shit! Oh well hopefully that worked hopefully that was enough we'll see! [Footsteps in room - Angela gasps] Hello? is there anybody there? That was hilarious! Oh my God, I think I heard some bumping around and she probably fell over something!!! My gosh that was so much fun [Exhales] [Ghostly breath] It feels different... Here we are home sweet home Safe! And she didn't catch me...brilliant This entity is so strong... I've never felt an entity with this amount of energy before it's been an incredible, incredible day I don't think that the entity is going to show itself to me again tonight I think it's probably used up all its energy moving the sleeping bag and the dust sheets so I think I might have a quiet night therefore I call upon my angels and my guardians to protect me to surround me with white light, Goddess bless me goodnight. I've just started recording because I had this really weird dream and in my dream something was saying behind you, behind you, and I woke up and I felt this really weird pressure and I feel that i need to look behind me, but I actually feel... I feel frightened okay I'm gonna do a pan of the room... [Growl] [Gasping] Did you get that? Can you see that oh my God did you see that?!!! I've just seen that Angela is doing a Facebook live let's just try and catch this... [Angela] It lifted right into the air and it's landed on this chair, I don't think you can see you can see it behind me I feel...I feel really weird okay You just keep breathing.... [Angela] I am protected.... [Angela] The air just felt...ominous...[Karen] Ominous! [Angela] How am I goning to sleep tonight? Oh, how are you going to sleep tonight...??? I need to do a meditation...I need to i need to make sure that I am protected and that my archangel Michael is here with me... [Karen] Archangel !

[Karen] Come on! What a load of bollocks... [Angela] Really strong forces at play in this house I cannot believe she gets away with this s**t I mean it's ridiculous... Okay... [Doorbell] Who's that? [Doorbell] [Knocking] [Sighs] yeah... Yeah i can see you Martin... [Martin] Karen, I know you're in there... Oh go away just go away [Martin knocks louder] [Martin] I just want to talk to you...let me in [He knocks again] [Rain and thunder] I did manage to get some sleep finally last night but it wasn't good sleep I feel a bit groggy today I am currently waiting the arrival of the guys that Terry has sent to do the roof now it's absolutely throwing it down outside at the minute so I'm hoping that they're going to arrive soon because I need to get on with the things that i have planned but I'm also hoping that they can still do the roof anyway oh I actually think that might be them okay did the door just open or did I leave it open? Looks great I guess I don't really know about roofs it looks like they're doing a good job though, I'll tell Terry There we go... Locked..just checking Oh yes... Right...so... The plan for....[Chair moves] Did you see that?? You definitely saw that...okay ! definite movage of the chair there... [Karen] sounds like she might be in ...okay [Angela] Looking at the chair... obviously there's nothing here... Something just came through the door another, another letter same style envelope nothing written on it which I'll turn this around so you can see makes me think that it's for me it seems very certain that it's for me [Karen] F**k...it's Martin... [Martin] I just want to talk okay? F**k off Martin go away Hello can I speak to inspector Mansfield please? yes I'll hold. Inspector hi it's Angela Bennett yes...well actually no I'm not fine. The woman that I previously reported she's been stalking me again well she has rang me a couple of times she's not said anything particular but I know it's her and she's left me poison pen letters I've had the locks changed.. [Martin] Oh come on I've had enough of your bollocks [Martin] You're not being fair, why won't you let me in? Go away! [Martin] Karen! What part of f**k off do you not understand? I've had enough of your bullocks, go. Go! [Martin] Fine, suit your bloody self F**king Hell... [Thumping and footsteps] Oh my God that's upstairs..! What....the....Hell?! It looks like it's pointing at something... must be Terry's stuff in here... [Phone alerts] my hand's shaking a bit it's giving me quite a chill So it's 11 p.m I feel really shattered my sleeping bag has gone missing I found some blankets upstairs in a cupboard these things here I feel quite apprehensive about tonight... the night time visits are becoming increasingly invasive what with the letters I just feel... my heart is beating... and I'm thinking should I be here? Should I be doing this? No Angela, you need to do this... I need to do this O kay i'm gonna try and get some sleep yeah right Right here we go some more paranormal activity chez Angela's! So much fun!!! So we are just going to kind of move things around again I like how we're kind of taking the level up a bit here.. it's gonna be wicked Wicked!!! So I've just woken up it's 1am... I felt this intense pressure around my neck as if someone was grabbing me I can't see anything there's no marks I don't know if you can see anything there? but I can definitely feel the presence it feels really strong I think it's trying to communicate with me [Door creaks open] the door...the door just opened...I'm gonna go down I'm gonna follow it I'm putting this down I'm getting the normal camera... okay... It's gone....must be a power cut... [Angela breathes nervously] [She gasps] Is that my sleeping bag??? Hello? How did you get that here spirit? What do you want? What do you want to show me? [Angela breathes nervously] There you are... hello I'm here I mean you no harm [Demonic growl] Who are you? Why are you here? I can help you...help you move on into the light... [Growling] [Angela breathes very heavily] I only want to help you! Okay it's quarter past one the light's still on so I'm just going to hang back for a little while see if that goes off... The power's back on fully. It's trying to communicate with me. That was another full manifestation and I rewatched the footage and it's been there right from the start I asked my guardian to show it to me and i saw it this is good but I feel drained because I need to sleep...okay It is now twenty to two, the light's been off now for about 20 minutes it's a bit of a risk but I think I'm gonna think I'm going to go in...okay [Whispers] Got the key... I can't hear anything okay we're in let's do some spooky stuff! okay we're in! [Whispers] Let's move some stuff around there we go [Whispers] Move this chair... [Door creaks] [Gasps] What the...! What the f**k...? Who is that? okay...I don't know what that is... I'm going to go... Oh my God...oh my God...oh my God Oh my God what the f**k was that? Nearly home...nearly home... Where are the keys...? Oh my god what the f**k was that oh my God...! Maybe maybe she's on to me maybe she knew that I'm coming around maybe there's someone else living in her house and she's just she's playing tricks on me or something... okay it was nothing it was just Morning oh God I did not sleep much last night at all still feel a bit weird at least I know where the sleeping bag is though in my dreams last night my spirit guide came to me and she said that whatever is in this house is nasty and I can feel that I know that I'm going to have to work really fast and really hard to get whatever it is out into the light and ready to pass over it's gonna be difficult though I'm gonna need a lot of energy and I don't want to...yeah I don't want to say this but I'm not necessarily looking forward to it it's gonna be a feat it's going to be hard I can feel it but I can do it! Time for a little phone call I think, I have my burner phone and I also have this handy little voice changing app...let me just find that...okay so put that there Here we go... [Angela's phone vibrates] Hello Angela speaking... [Distorted] Hello Angela Hello who is this? [Distorted laugh] Who is this? [Distorted] Don't you know? I thought you were psychic! I think i know who this is... [Distorted] Oh do you really I think you're a fraud! I don't have to be psychic to be able to work out who you are... [Distorted] Really??? You've been sending me letters? [Distorted] Oh yes I'm sure you've been receiving loads of letters loads of lovely letters... I think I gave you some financial advice [Distorted] You don't know what you're talking about I think I do Karen Keane and I'll be going to the police you f**king psycho! S**t! Oh my God... She knows who I am...she knows who I am... She can't go to the police she's bluffing...no F**k!!! I knew it was her, she's an absolute crackpot. Where does the f**king woman get off ? Does she get enjoyment out of upsetting and making other people feel on edge and you know followed... it's absolutely despicable! I hope she gets arrested for this... [Banging upstairs] What was that noise? [More banging upstairs] I'm going upstairs... [Thump] [Angela breathes nervously] [Static] [Angela] Hello..? [Strange growl comes from walkie-talkie] [Angela] It's you isn't it? [Distorted growl] [Angela] What do you want? [Inteligable voice comes from the speaker] [Angela] Okay...I'm listening... [Distorted voice] The cellar... [Angela] You want me to go to the cellar? [Distorted voice] This evening.... [Angela] Okay... [Angela] I'll just check... [Angela] There's no battery... So it's getting darker so I'm taking everything that I need down to the cellar in preparation for hopefully speaking again with the entity I've got candles and walkie-talkie and some stuff already down there so really excited! I surround myself with white light. I am protected Spirit I call upon you to communicate with me [walkie-talkie gets louder] the entity that resides between these walls I ask you to speak to me like you instructed earlier... [Distorted voice come from the speaker] I am here! Good spirit yes but I cannot hear you [The spirit's voice is distorted and jumbled up] [Spirit voice] My house... ...good spirit I am glad you are here. I am here to help you to guide you to the light... [The spirits voice is unclear] Mine...mine Why are you here spirit? [Static] [Spirit voice] My...house [Spirit voice] My...house Did you live here? [Spirit voice] [Growls] I am in....the darkness [Spirit voice] I'm...I'm here And...what is it that you want? [Spirit voice] A soul... Did I hear that correctly did you say a soul? [Spirit voice] One...will....DIE! Why spirit? Why will one die? [Distorted voice come through the speaker] Mine...mine Okay I don't have to go I could just... I could just leave it there can't I? just leave it there I don't need to go...I don't need to go I'll just i'll leave it...I'll leave it...

I can't feel it and that's really unlike me to not be able to feel something ... it feels very quiet and still there's a part of me that thinks that the entity could just be lying low though I don't know I feel slightly strange about this I don't think I'm gonna sleep much tonight... that sounded like the front door! Oh my God! I can hear her coming...She's coming down... No no...no Through here... Okay... Oh my God... Turn this off..turn this off Okay maybe I'm just a bit spooked it's definitely shut... what I'm going to do though is...I'm going to...can you see that? I'm going to double lock it and Locking the bottom lock as well I'll turn this light out but I'm gonna double lock that cellar... as well because you know what? Whatever is in there can stay in there tonight [Angels's footsteps going upstairs] See if... Oh my God... it's so cold down here Okay this is really weird I keep sort of nodding over them waking up because I hear this sort of rustling noise from downstairs and when I look like there's nothing there but I keep hearing the noise again and again oh my God there it is again... What the f**k is that??? [Shouting] Angela? Angela??? [Growling] [Karen queals] Oh my GOD! [Karen] Oh my God [Screams and banging] [Angela] Oh my God...

What the hell? look at me...[strange noises from Karen] [Karen laughs] [Angela] Why won't you look at me? What the...what the hell is wrong with you? Karen, what's wrong with you? [A demonic voice comes from Karen] It's you...it's you isn't it?! [Demonic growl] What? Demon I command you to leave this vessel I command you to leave this woman in the name of the father the mother and the holy spirit [Karen growls and roars] I call upon my angels to protect me with white light call upon my angels to show me to protect me [Karen snarls] Karen can you hear me?

[Ambulance approaches] She's gone the ambulance has taken her to the hospital...

[Phone vibrates] Hello Angela speaking... She's...she's alive! She's alive... That means... I need to get out... [The demon snarls and Angela screams] [Angela gasps for breath]
