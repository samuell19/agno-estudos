- Good morning! - Hey! How are you? Hi! Hey! Sorry! Morning, Soph! Early as promised. Stock inventory is go! Hey, Rose! Nice night? Did Chris come over? Um, no, he didn't. He's pretty busy right now. He has two commissions: that new vineyard and a house in Auckland. And his football... Uh-oh. Soph, how many times? Football, rugby. Important. Maybe why Chris hasn't... Possibly. Give him time! Two years is time! What's up? This came from King Family Farm. They're stopping production and taking a whole bunch of our sales with them, just as I'm looking to expand the business. But nobody makes yarn like Ida. Why would she close the mill? Sheep uprising? I'm gonna get to the bottom of this. Can you do the inventory while I do some digging? - No worries, boss. - Thank you. - I'll be back. - OK! Well, you can quit worrying, Dad. I'm here. Yeah, well, I would have called earlier, but I had to get a new SIM card for my cell, and... Well, yeah, yeah, I can... Sure, I can do that. I'll be more... Uh, I... I'll be more expeditious. I can be as expeditious as possible. Sure. Hey, say hi to Mo... Have a biscuit... home-made. Thanks, Aunt Ida. Just Ida'll do. My brother giving you a hard time? Well, he's worried about me driving on the wrong side of the road. And getting things done quickly, hey? There was an element of that, yeah. Well, I've got the books ready for you in the office. And when you want to have a look around this place, there's gummies on the veranda. - Gumboots, for your feet. - Oh. And you need to change out of that gear too. It's muddy out there. Any jeans? Yeah, I... I came prepared. Great coffee! Locally roasted. They tried to grow beans in the Coromandel, north-east. So, Ida, are... are you OK with this? Personally, sure. Fits in with my plans. But... But selling off entirely? I think that would be a shame, Sam. Don't let Dad hear you say that. I have. I told him on the phone, at length. At least do an audit! Which is why I'm here. But King Enterprises has outgrown it, and, well, Dad had pretty much forgotten the... the farm was still on the books. "There is no room for sentiment in business." Yeah. That's actually scarily accurate. Yeah. That's what your father thinks. What do you think about selling off? This is where the whole business started! History, Sam! Yeah, I... I can see that. It's just history versus future. Put that to my father, and no contest. Ah! Come on! You might want to sit down to do that. Uh, you might be right. Oh! Yeah. Here, this pair might be a better fit. Um, thanks. You know, I'm... I'm new to this. Really? Never would have known. Your car? Rental, yeah. I'm from the States. Like you, huh? What's a fellow American doing way down here? Escaping LA. Ah! Well, now, that I can understand. I'm not, like, a big fan of LA myself. East Coast, born and bred. New York. Ah! So, not liking LA would be mandatory, of course. Oh, absolutely! I mean, poor you. You had to grow up there, huh? Hey, I managed to survive the sunshine. So, New Zealand... Yeah, my mom is a Kiwi. She met my dad in the States and stayed. I'm here because of my grandma, really. Small inheritance. I came to find out about it, and 3 years later... Escapee from the West Coast life. Nice work! Well, turns out I'm a country girl at heart. You don't miss home? Oh, I miss Mom. But... this is home now. And you have me calling her "Mom" already. - No, I call her "Mum" now. - Oh. I picked up her old accent, she says. Hey, hi! I am Sophie. Nice to meet you, Sophie! I'm Samuel. Uh, King. Oh. I hope you're not the reason I'm here. - Are you? - Uh... - Sophie! - Hi! - What a nice surprise! - Hi! I see you've met my nephew. Sophie sells our yarn in her shop, Sam. Oh. I'm supposed to have an order for Sophie, but I'm sorry, love, it's still drying. Tomorrow, I promise. Uh, no, that's fine. It's just... I'm here because I... I got your letter, Ida. I have to say, I'm so disappointed! I just can't understand why you'd be stopping production. It's not just the yarn, love. It might be the whole shebang! Which is why I'm here, to see if King Enterprises should sell. Right, I see. So, you are the reason I'm here. What about you, Ida? Either way, I'll go. I've been invited to Mosgiel to teach weaving and wool dying. Mentoring a whole lot of young talent! Wow, that's great! I am so happy for you! Ah, but their gain is our loss. Ida's yarn is our best-seller. Local product from a great local artist. Thank you, Sophie. Thanks for letting us know so promptly, Ida. Expeditious. Runs in the family. Mmm... Speedy, you mean. The speed limit in town is 50 kilometers, Mr. King. Wow! That was you. I am... I'm so sorry. Unfamiliar car, wrong side of the road. And your speed limit signs have me so confused. I mean, I was... Being overly expeditious, yeah? Oh... Good luck with the audit, Mr. King. Bye! Oh! Hey! Take off those gummies! You are out of control! I mean, does all this yarn really need to be in rainbow-betical order? I want it to look as beautiful as possible. It's incredible stuff! And can you believe Ida makes it all herself? The customers are gonna be so disappointed when it's gone. Maybe they don't have to be. Disappointed, I mean. Maybe we don't have to lose the yarn. Here we go! Glenda, Kyle... Last of the yarn? What's that about? - Well, I think it's a shame. - It is. It's a huge shame. But Sophie's got a plan, I think. Formulating one. If Ida can turn out all this yarn by herself, maybe we can too. It's worth exploring. If I'm gonna build the business, it's probably more than worth it. Yep! You've made your shop the heart of this place, Sophie. And the bigger that heart, the better! Hi there! Can I help you? Hi! Um, I'm Lucy. I was wanting to join the knitting group, if you're still accepting people. Oh! There's no accepting. People just turn up! Come through, take a seat. I'm Sophie. You'll get to know everybody else. There's tea, coffee and pastries, courtesy of Kyle. Kyle is our resident baker. You sit here by me. I'm Glenda. Make yourself comfy. Wow! That's a lot of baking! Yeah. Kyle starts baking at 4:00 a.m. He starts knitting straight after. He's got his priorities right. Yeah. Hi, Lucy! I'm Rose. Eat those. Save me from myself. Oh, you... you're nearly done, Soph. I honestly didn't think you'd finish in time. It's for Chris, her boyfriend. Oh. It's his birthday tomorrow. Kyle's gonna bake him a cake. - Right, Kyle? - Yep! It's beautiful. Maybe I should make a sweater for my boyfriend. Oh, I wouldn't do that if I were you. Don't listen to her, Lucy. "The sweater curse..." It's ridiculous. Ridiculous? Young lady, there is nothing in the knitting universe more powerful than the sweater curse. Some people believe if you knit a sweater for your partner before you're married, they'll leave you. It happened to me! Twice. And I'm not the only one. I hadn't even finished the jumper for my boyfriend when he emailed to break up. Who emails to break up? Especially when you can text. - Oh! - Sorry. What about you and the sweater curse, Kyle? He doesn't like to talk about it. You knit whatever you like, Lucy. We can even get you started if you want. We do one-on-one lessons. The first two are free. And it is just a dumb superstition. I suppose we'll find out when Chris gets his sweater, then, won't we? Ooh! What color can I start you with? - I like that one. - Perfect! - Want me to take them both? - No, I'll take one. Is that the audit guy you were telling me about? Mr. Numbers, yeah. You also failed to mention he's Mr. Dreamy. He is one of the reasons we won't have Ida's yarns, so don't you go being too nice to the guy. But I always try to be nice, Soph. Hi! "Rest of the yarn tomorrow," which is today, as promised. Oh, thank you for delivering it, Ida. So, you're Samuel. Rose. Pleasure. Hi. In the stock room for now, please, Rose. Rose? May I? Yeah, sure. Come in. Huh! It's nice in here. To be honest, I've never been inside a knitting store before. Really? What, you buy your silk/cashmere online then, huh? Department store. Different vibe. This place has a nice one. I hope making it bigger is the right move, then. I have a proposition. If the milling equipment is not going with you, Ida, I'd like to buy it. Oh, I'm not taking it. I'll be all set up there. But, I mean, the equipment, it's... Part of the assets, which has to get sold at market price. Might just be a tad over your budget. And how do you know that? Well, sorry, I don't mean to be rude. It's just... It's really expensive machinery and tough to operate too. I imagine it is. Ida, when do you leave? Two weeks. The boys can bring the city bloke up to speed on the farm, but I need to show him the area first, the local economy. How about a quid pro quo? Ida, you teach me how to make and dye the yarns, and I show Sam how things work around Kingsvale. Well, I think it's a great idea. Sophie really knows the area and all the locals. She'd be a great tour guide! And if you can tell me what the budget is, it'll give me two weeks to make sure I can manage it. Sound like a deal? Well, I'm supposed to have this all wrapped up inside a week, but... I guess I can buy you a little time. - Deal. - Deal. Soph, hey! Happy birthday! I come bearing gifts. A late-harvest Riesling from Mike Barnes' Cellar Door. He says happy birthday. Oh, that's nice! It should go nicely with Kyle's contribution. I was thinking we could have a night in. Some wine, some cake... I was actually thinking we'd go down to the pub and have a beer with the boys from the team. From the foot... The... From the rugby team. Uh, sure! We can do that. It's your birthday. And, hey, it is one way of making sure all the cake gets eaten. But first, presents. Guess what? A new pair of rugby boots? Huh. Ta-da! Oh, wow! That's... that's a nice pullover, Soph. Real nice. - It's not a "pullover." - Oh. And... and it's not "nice." This is a beautifully handcrafted cable-knit polo-neck sweater! Mmm... Put it on! Careful! Sorry. It's... It's a bit tight. Oh, I'm sure I had the right measurements. And quite itchy around the neck. - Itchy? - Yeah. That is the finest merino wool. Do you know how many microns the fibers are? No. And to be honest, I don't... I can't... I won't wear this. Sorry. - Don't pull at it. - Sorry. Sophie, Sophie, I can't wear this down at the pub, OK? I'm sorry. This isn't about the sweater. I think we should sit and talk, about us. The sweater curse... What? N-nothing. Um, look, I know that I've been busy with the business and not as here as I could have been... No, Soph, look, you're great. You're amazing, OK? This isn't about you. This is about us. I think we're right in so many ways. It's just that... I mean, you're so focused on all this. It's what I do, Chris. It's all you do, Soph. I mean, you must be the only person I know that can't get ethusiastic about rugby or... Chris, I'm American. I can't get enthusiastic about the rugby. Yeah, well, I can't get enthusiastic about knitting or wool. 17.7 microns. The fibers, twice as thick as human hair. Let me guess: The sweater destroyed your relationship and left you sad and single? More puzzled than sad. But single? Definitely. What? Wait, I was joking. You didn't really break up? As Kyle would say, yep! We actually broke up. Oh! I should have stopped you knitting that thing. No! If a man can get spooked by a bit of cable knit, he is not the man for me. Did he tell you it wasn't you and that you're really, really great? Basically. Yeah. They always say that. I guess I can always sell it at the store. Good idea! One of the last King Family Farm creations. Oh, sorry. Today was not your day, huh? Ay-ay-ay! Don't answer it. It'll be Chris. Changed his mind. They always do that as well. Uh... No, I'll get it. No thanks. I already ate. Uh... Hi. We were just... Yeah, well, Ida found this box that we missed, and I said I'd drop it by, so... Oh. Thank you! Come in. OK. Um... Uh, nice sweater! Sophie made it. But it's cursed. Oh. Well, I better... Oh, hey, thank you! Thank you! I bet he kept that yarn back on purpose. Yeah, sure. At least it wasn't Chris. Ah! OK, enough wallowing for one day. Oh, no, no, no. Rose... Come on! Come on! Cake and ice cream are doing it for me. No! Come here! What you doing out here, hey? Ay-ay-ay! There you go! No, Mom, I don't miss the city. But if Chris broke up with you... It was mutual, Mom, I think. A-a-anyway, that's no reason to just pack up and leave, not after nearly 3 years of work. Pity. An architect would be great to have in the family. I closed on a gem of an apartment yesterday that would have been perfect for you. All you need to do is sell that shop and come home, with the cash to buy something. This is home now. LA is... The place where you got a degree in journalism, darling, just by the way. You should be back here using it, doing great things. I think knitting is a great thing. Lots of people do, including Glenda, who was asking about you again last week, just by the way. She was a heck of a realtor, Glenda. Shame she gave it up. Uh, she didn't give it up, Mom. She retired. She still misses you. You should give her a call. Perhaps I will. In the meantime, I have a business to run, viewings. Just think about what I've said, darling, OK? Bye, Mum. Mom. Mom... - Hey... - Wow! Oh, uh, I was talking to my mum. You sleep with sheep. Yeah, it saves counting them. Well, reporting for duty. You're up early. Well, you have an enthusiastic student. OK... Good. I will be ready in 10. Hard to believe, I know, but... No, it's fine. I'll be waiting out front. B-b-bye! - Doing OK there? - Yeah. And then I go around... - That's the one. - OK. Then out, through and in. Yeah, that's the one. Nice! Hey, Soph! I'm having my lesson. Oh, great! Let's take a look. It'll have to be quick, though. Samuel's waiting. So I'm thinking something structurally simple, but with some variations in the stitch. Yes! Good choice for starters. That's a really nice scarf, Lucy. Just I'm so nervous about making a mistake. I'm a bit of a perfectionist. You know, I don't worry too much about mistakes. I call them "design elements." Every piece is unique. We see mistakes, but most people, they just see a lovely piece of work. I volunteer at the Makers' Fair every year, but I never see you there! You're so talented. It'd be a great place to sell your work. I can organize a spot for you if you like! - Really? - Yeah, really! Oh, that would be amazing! Do that! Thank you! Ah, make it 5 free lessons. Yeah? Uh, I have to go. I have some other teaching to do. You're fine with this, Rose? I am the ninja of knitting. Go. Don't sell any more of that King Yarn for the moment. Where to, teach? A good place to rip out an undercarriage, if we go in that thing. He's probably been digging for some tuatua. Shellfish. See, the local Iwi, the tribe, they have fishing rights. There are quotas for what can be taken from the sea. It's all about management, self-sustainment. Morning! - Don't catch a cold, hey? - OK. Didn't Ida tell you how Kingsvale got its name? No. See, all this belonged to your family once, for generations. It's gradually been broken down into smaller parcels and sold, but in many ways, it's... it's still one. How? The sheep. They're just the top layer. Did you know there are 4 vineyards in this area? You'd think they'd be rivals, right? But someone has a problem, they all pitch in. See, no one's gonna drive all the way down here just to visit one vineyard. They want to visit a few, go shopping. The vintners need each other. And the rest? You? Well, my yarn might attract someone who wants to buy an antique or some artisan loaves of bread. And it could work the other way around. Kyle's bread could lead to a sale of my yarn. It's a micro-economy, self-sustaining. So, by definition, not profitable. Well, that depends on what you consider profit to be. Money, happiness, a great life... OK. Seen enough? Posterity. You enjoy taking photographs, huh? Well, when I have time. Well, we should all make time for the things we enjoy. Oh. Come on! OK. Hey! I have a plan: a booth at the fair. Fair? It is a big deal. Artisans and craftspeople from all over the region come together. There's wine, produce, woodworking, crafts, clothes, everything! I am gonna raffle off the King Yarn, sell as many knitted items as I can. I will raise the money for that mill equipment. That is a lot of selling. I have some savings too. I'm not as short as you might think. And, like I said, there's a lot of support here. Everyone will be happy to help. You'll see. Is everything all right? Whoa, whoa! Uh, not really. I mean, you wanna hold her? Absolutely! - OK. - Hey! Him. Oh! He is a strong little guy! Yeah, he... he's starving. I heard him bleating in there, and thought, you know... I'm trying to tell him, he's being bottle fed. Well, if he's being fed, then why is he wailing? Uh, because they're like babies. The kids late for the feed again? - Yeah. - What kids? Come on. OK. The local school has a roster going for orphan lambs, bottle feeding. It's a class project. They have four going. Uh, OK. I should probably go tend to the books. Oh, no, no! I have my lesson with Ida. You can take over here. Um... Oh. See? Silence of the lamb. Just a bit softer. You need to wash it, but you don't want to felt it together. OK... I am getting a whole new appreciation for your yarn now, Ida. Well, it's nice to spend time with someone who takes an interest. It's a pity Sam doesn't. It's hard to see things when your attention is channeled. Sam's never been allowed to chart his own course. It's always been assumed that he'd take over from my brother and run the textile business. Well, that's where his head seems to be. Maybe his head needs to be turned. Well, it... it's a big place. And I'm gonna need more time. Uh, I'll be out of range a lot of that time, so if you want the job done properly, Dad, you'll have to leave me alone to do it. I'll be in touch when I have some results. Sick him, tiger! Results? Projections for the next two years, which brings me to this, Ida. These wool grades, the finest are the best, right? - Right. - Most profitable. But we don't put any up for export. I mean, that's crazy. Where do they, uh... Oh... Sophie, can I have a minute? Sure. I'll let you two... With you. A minute with you. Uh... Looks like you did a good job. Well, I'm taking my schooling seriously. Lamb feeding, self-sustainment, gummies, export... You're wasting your time, Sophie. You're a business woman. Part of running a business is letting go of things that aren't working. Letting go of dreams? Sometimes, if we have to, yeah. But crafting the yarn here is such a huge part of what makes all this so special, Sam. Your aunt knows that. Sheep products make up over 4% of your GDP. Wow! Yes, wow! That's a major export. If this farm doesn't tap into that market, it'll have to be sold. Well, isn't that what you want? It's not a question of what I want. It's what the books say. And the books are telling me that if we export the best wool, then, well, we can make a small profit. But if we sell it at local domestic prices... A loss. So, even if I sell you the equipment, which, believe me, my father's gonna want market value... I won't have the raw materials to make the yarn. I see. I love that smell. Lanolin. Oh. OK. OK, there. Hey, um, I'm sorry. Do you like it here? Um... Yeah, it's... it's beautiful. It is. Do you know, at one point, I tried to convince myself that I wanted to be a journalist, but I always dreamed of making a living doing something that I love. And, yeah, it's weird, maybe, but... I love knitting. Well, weird's not always such a bad thing. So... What was your dream? Uh, photography, maybe? But what? It got replaced by "make it big in the city"? Well, yeah, that's what I've always been told, yeah. No! No one tells us what to dream. We choose our own dreams. Or they sneak up on us from behind and grab ahold. Maybe I always was a small-town girl, and I just didn't know it yet. Maybe. Wool. Thank you. I can't afford to be wooly-headed? I've got things to do. Do you remember what I told you, that this is a community here? People help each other? Uh-huh. There are a lot of farms here, Sam. A lot of those sheep with the finest wool. And when I see a challenge, I don't back down. So, just pulling the piece like... like that? Yeah, perfect. Being fed in on a conveyor belt. And it goes through... Good! Looking good! There you go! There you go! Good! Yeah. OK! Yay! Nice! Yeah, buddy! Whoo! Calling it a day? Yeah, knit group this afternoon. Oh. Well, how's the spinning going, Rumpelstiltskin? Turning to gold. You want to come? To the knit group. Me? Well, I don't think I fit the target demographic, "Oh..." You would be surprised how young our crowd is. We even have some guys who come along. - Really? - Sure! Real men don't just drive wool bales around on mini-loaders. Oh, and here was me thinking that the only people that knit were old ladies. Excuse me! Do I look like an old lady to you? Oh, well, yeah... Oh! Tread very carefully, Mr. King. I have needles in my car. You... you have knitting in your car. Yes! Of course. You never know when you might want to decorate a tree or someone's mini-loader. You take yarn everywhere you go? Pretty much. OK! Got a problem with that? Oh, yeah, Ida gives me that look too. Good. You deserve it. You know, you should update your knitting stereotyping, Sam. A good businessman knows demographics shift all the time. Huh, OK. Well, I might have to take you up on that offer, then, being the good businessman I am. All right. What time? 4:00! And don't be late! A stitch in time... See you later! "See you later!" Is that a date? More of a challenge, I think. I have to learn how to knit. Knitting, you? Mmm... Wow! She must be pretty special. Oh, wow! Look who's here. I invited him. If he sees where the wool ends up, it might change his thinking. Uh, so, Samuel. Sam, ready to make a fool of himself. - Hi, Sam! - Hi! Uh, Ida let me borrow these needles, so... Come in! Take a seat. Yeah. Oh! Here you go, Sam. Sit yourself down. - Hello, Sam! - Col. Come on. Did you bring some yarn? Uh, yarn. Tha-that would have been a good idea. Might I suggest... this. Our finest wool, locally produced. You don't say! First skein is on the house. Uh, I will be right back. Good luck! Hi there! - OK. - Can I help you? Right, well, do you know how to cast on? - No. - Col will show you. - Oh yeah. - OK. Thank you. - And around... - OK! - OK... - He's getting it! Yeah. Great! - Yes! - There you are! So, how's he doing? - Having a ball! - Yeah, see? Sweet as! He's a natural. Yeah, hey, hey, guys, thanks for the lesson, you know, and... and the pastries. - I might even come back. - Yeah! Oh, that's how we get them. Always, always! OK, I'll see you guys later. - See you! - See you! - Bye! - See you! Hey, now, I, uh, I don't want to brag, but I'm kind of a genius at this whole knitting thing. Oh... Hey, do you... do you advertise these sessions? Yeah, they're listed on our website. Uh, social media? I hardly ever update it. - Rose does! - Ah! Sometimes... OK. Let's have a look. Homespun... Uh, wow! OK. It's, uh, it's a bit bare bones. Come on! It's not that bad! You've dropped a stitch here. If you hadn't invited me, I would have never known about this group. Your social media doesn't show how much fun it can be. Yeah, well, once people meet us and find out, they seem to come back, so... OK, but maybe you could use this to get more people in here. OK, I could update it more often. Yeah, I mean, what you got here is just... Well, it's so good. I bet we could get you a bunch of new customers by upping your online presence. We? Sorry, I'm being presumptuous. It's... I see a business problem I can fix, and I just can't help myself. You just need more images and some decent photographs. OK, yeah, if you want to. It'd be my pleasure, Ms. Markham. But we should do it sooner rather than later. OK. OK, that would be great. OK. I'll see you later. Sooner. Bye, Sam. Thanks! No ring. I reckon he's single. It is just business! Yeah, sure it is. This is nice, you calling me. Well, I wanted to talk with you about the store. Great! You're selling the business. Glenda can probably help. No, Mom, not even close. The opposite, in fact. I want to expand the business. I'm... I want to buy my own milling equipment. Oh! Making my own yarn is a smart investment. It's a way to grow the business naturally. See, our best-selling wool is locally made, but they're stopping production, so... You want to buy a failing business. It's not failing, Mom. The owners are just moving on to other things. And I'm... I'm just buying equipment. Not many knitting shops make their own yarn on-site, so... Are they willing to sell this equipment? Yes. Yes, they are. But I only have a week left to raise the money. Now, I can manage most of it, but I think I'm gonna come up short. So I was wondering if... Sophie, please don't ask me to help you do something foolish. I'm not. I just thought, you're my mother and that, maybe, you might want to support me. Why do you hate knitting so much? I don't! That's absurd. Mom... Grandma told me she tried to teach you to knit. I tried! Finicky little needles and knots. Just not my thing, darling. You're allowed to not be good at everything, Mom. No, I'm not. Knitting can't possibly have any real future in a world of evolving technology. And, Sophie, I can't help you rush headlong into what sounds like disaster! Has my mom always been such a pain? She was a scallywag as a kid. Good fun. When your grandma had the shop, we spent lots of time here. Wasn't so flash in those days, of course, but we loved it. We used to play tiddlywinks with buttons on the floor right there. Later, when we were a bit older, making dresses. So, no, dear, she wasn't always a pain. You still miss her. Some friendships just won't go away. We went into real estate together. And that's what took her away, in the end. I was sad when she went to America, for a long time. And then, I was very happy when your grandma left you the shop and you decided to take it on. You should give her a call, have a chat. She'd like that. I might just do that. These ones too, I think. OK! You know, what we need to do is find a really cool spot, show natural products in a natural environment. Great! Oh, I think I know just the spot! OK! How's it going? Chris, hi! Good, great! Uh, really busy. You? Yeah, you know, all good, yeah. The vineyard thing fell through, but the house in Ponsonby is still a go, so... Hi! Hi! Samuel, or Sam. I'm sorry. Chris, Sam. We're doing a photo shoot for my website! Oh, right. You... you a photographer, Sam? For today, I am, yeah. Right. And... we really need to get this thing on the road. Yeah. No, all good. Hey, it was good to see you, Soph. Good luck with everything. You too. All right. I'll, um, I'll catch you around. Nice guy! Ex-boyfriend? - Ah, you got that, huh? - Yeah. Recently ex. Oh, um, I'm sorry. No, no. No, it's fine. Rugby versus cable knit. Two worlds, one long story. Short one, actually. And I think I know just where to shoot. Bring that box! Uh, OK! Hey, what about this blue one? Yeah, put that over there. Oh, it's such a beautiful color! - Put that on there. - Yeah. Oh, that is such a good contrast. Nice. Maybe... What else? Hey, is this the one Rose said you made yourself? Labor of love. It's going into the Makers' Fair. It's so soft! - Not itchy? - No, it's beautiful! You know, we should get some good shots of it. Promote the booth, you, this sweater. Show people what yarn can become. I mean, man, this... this really is beautiful. Here, put it on. What? No! It's too big for me! No! Even better. Put it on. OK... Don't look. No, sorry. See? Doesn't fit. Uh... Yeah, I know. I'm terrible. I hate having my photograph taken. No, you're fantastic. It's, uh... It's me. Yeah, sure. That's what Chris said. No, really. It's my framing. I just need more practice. You're beautiful! I mean, you're great. See? Great. So, how recent was Chris? Too recent for it to be comfortable yet? Yeah, he kind of looked like he was regretting it. Oh, I doubt that. No, he's probably relieved. Maybe we were never really right for each other, if I'm being honest. That's a shame. Well, it takes two to not tango. Yeah. What about you? Anyone on the dance card in New York? Nope. Never had time. Two left feet, I guess. I doubt that too. Hey, yeah! This one is terrific. Yeah. They're fantastic! Sophie's modeling. Your shots! Oh, I've had another idea for the Makers' Fair. Live sheep? A knit-o-thon, a race, all skill levels welcome. Turning out a scarf. The longest one wins. Could be the ugliest thing ever. That's what makes it fun. And... an auction, this! We'll make more money from it that way. People always spend more when they're competing against each other. She's getting the hang of this. We are gonna push this weekend's events big time on my social media. We? Yeah, well, you used the term first. This is all your fault, Mr. King! These are gonna get a whole lot of extra bodies along to the store and to the fair. Sounds like we're gonna need all the help we can get. OK, hold it out, hold it out! OK, hold on. Perfect! Yeah, yeah. - Stay... stay there! - OK. Yes! Yes! Nice! I got it. OK, hold them out. Nice! Yeah, nice. I like that. Let's go. Perfect! There! That looks great. Rose was right. The promo ones are amazing too. Yeah, well, the camera likes you. I mean, they're beautiful. Looks like you inspired Rose too. Yeah, she's certainly into her subject. I really appreciate you doing this. Well, I told you. I can't help myself. You know, I'm really starting to get this whole yarn thing. But don't worry. I'm not gonna open my own store any time soon, even though I know you like a challenge. Ha! A challenge? - Yeah. - You? Ah, you wouldn't stand a chance! - Which is why I'll stick to what I know: the books. Um... But I'll, uh, I'll post the ones that we... we picked out, and then get the rest printed. Great! Thank you for today. Oh! Samuel! Your... your camera! Hey, guys. The donations! - Oh, wonderful! - Amazing! Hey, Rose, what do you think of this? Please... I'll just double check. Do we have any more of the sapphire color out of the back? Um, yes, but it's another dye lot. Look! Everyone loves it! Are they saying they're coming to the Makers' Fair? See you! How's Sophie doing? With the lessons? Really well. She isn't just good at knitting. No, she's a woman of many talents. You haven't reconsidered selling the mill equipment? No, it's still the right decision. Ida, if I change the business plan, this place will lose money. I can't just do that because the person that wants to buy the machines is a friend. Is she? Just a friend? Hi! Sophie! Oh, Sophie, I completely forgot our dying lesson. Do you mind if we put it off? I, um, need to get some supplies. - Sure. - What supplies? Just things. You two stay out of trouble. Or not! Um... Coffee or tea? Sure! Some tea, please. Wow! You have assimilated. So, how's the social media working out? Great! You know, we did 20% more business this week than the same week last year. Excellent! And the market prep? Mmm, it's coming together. All under control? Well, since it's under control... and Ida's deserted you, you wanna help me instead? Sure! What were you thinking? Oh, just cleaning out the water troughs, checking on the lambing ewes. Easy. You got it. Ah, you could help me! This is heavy! Where do you want them? Uh, I don't know. Oh, crap! Whoa! - What did you do? - Get in there! What did you do? Ah! Ah! That's, uh, great! Oh, you could have warned me! I was not prepared for that! Well, hey! I didn't see you rushing in to help. Oh, well, I guess my shirt will dry. And hey, look! Knitted socks. My feet are still warm. Wet wool retains heat. Huh. I bet you're wishing your shirt was made from wool, huh? Ah, like the Vikings used to. They used to make all their clothes out of wool because they spent so much time on the water. Sometimes, their sails were even wool too. It's amazing stuff. So, you're saying my next attempt at knitting should be sails or socks? Hmm... Looks like socks might be the way to go. Ah! Oh, you know, we have a blanket that my grandmother always said was made from the wool of the very last sheep that her ancestors from way back raised in England. And that when they came over and settled, they didn't bring much, but they brought that blanket. Aw, that's lovely! Yeah. Well, knitting is like that. Heirloom jumpers, um, sweaters, handed down through generations. It connects people. It... it's your creative energy that connects the people here. It's fantastic. Thank you. Your passion for what you do is... It's my favorite thing about you. You built a whole community just off that passion. And I wish I had that for what I do. Maybe you just need to look for it somewhere else. Uh, racing cars, perhaps. Ah, I haven't broken the speed limit for days. I don't know. It's like there's more time here to figure out your wants, your passions, like a whole new pace to life. In New York, I always feel like, uh, I'm moving fast. Even sitting behind a desk, it can be relentless. Yeah, well, sometimes, it's good to slow down. Helps you see what you've been missing. Yeah. I'm gonna miss all this when I go back to New York. Well, you can't go until after the Makers' Fair, because otherwise, you won't have time to acknowledge my triumph. OK. Well, I'll... I'll at least stay to do that, I promise. Oh, you might want to... - Sit down? - sit down, yeah. Yeah, OK. Balance, Sam. It's very important in life. Balance. Oh, it's fine. It's just water! Col... Sam. Oh, whoa! Col and the gang have been working on it in the utility shed, for the market. What do you think? Well, it's... Isn't it wild? Uh, I... I think you better get your knitting project out of your car and give me a free private lesson. Uh, I mean, at least it's still driveable. Concentrate! Here, bring the yarn to the front. - Yeah. - Put it through. - Around... - All right. Purl's just the same as knit, except the bump ends up on the other side. - Like that? - Perfection. You know, I'm gonna finish this scarf and donate it to your cause. Don't get ahead of yourself! We only have 3 days. Hey! You might want to reconsider and make a coaster. Well, you're not the only determined one around here. Or the most focused. In, around, under and off. - Yeah. - Practice. You know what? I think I might even keep my knitting and needles in the car. Stop! Truce, truce! Hey! You're gonna pay for that, Mr. King! - Hey! Hey, stop! - Here I am! Hey, you guys gotta come see this! There's a ewe. She's come into the hay shed. She's ready to lamb. Really? I have never seen a lamb being born before. Me neither. You're gonna love this then. Come on! It's the circle of life! Come on! Whoo! The circle of life! Col was right! That was amazing! Col was just great! I'm so happy we got to share that. Yeah, me too. Oh... Are you gonna get that? Ah! Uh, that can go to voicemail. My father's ringtone. You know, kind of suits him. He's on my case about getting home, closing deals. So, here's the important part. We attended the birth, so it is our duty to come up with a name, right? Uh, Wooly, 'cause sheep are... - What... - No, OK. What else have you got? Uh, Jumper, 'cause she's... Oh, come on! Ida did get all the creativity in the gene pool. Hey, that's not true! I'm a photographer. Oh! You finally realized that, huh? Good for you. So, the lamb, she's a girl, so... Ba-aarbara. - Ah! - Obviously. Yes! That's great! You know what? I think Ba-aarbara needs to come back and join team Homespun. Every yarn shop needs a resident sheep. I'm surprised you don't have one already. Come on! I'm focused on the milling equipment at the moment. Mmm... And I should probably go. I am late for knit group, again. You're leading me astray. What... Hey, thanks for an unusual day. Thank you. It was amazing! Did you know a newborn lamb can stand up in a half hour? I mean, I knew it, but I had never actually seen it before. It was so gorgeous! So cute! Unsteady... Kind of like Sam, really. He's pretty special, huh? Yeah, he is. The... she. The lamb. It's a girl. Sophie, news flash! You're falling in love with this man. No! I was just... Rose, I just broke up with Chris 2 weeks ago. It's too soon. You've been breaking up with Chris for a long time. And guess what? Knitting follows a pattern. Love doesn't. Maybe this is exactly the right time. But he's so stubborn and determined. Hmm, like someone else I know. And he's leaving, in two days. No. No, I just need to focus on that mill. Stubborn, determined... Stop! Romance can come later, if and when. I don't think that's quite how these things work, Sophie. Awesome! Wonderful! Lucy's a natural. Yeah! Yeah, see you! Keep practicing! OK, thank you. Bye! Have a good day. Bye! Good job! It is really impressive how far you've come so quickly, Lucy. If you can help someone with knitting, it means yours has really improved. You keep it up! Soon, you're gonna be as good as any of us, maybe even better. I don't know about that. I do feel more confident, though. Good! Hang on to that confidence. We'll need it at the Makers' Fair. Sophie. - Hey! - Quick! It's important. - What... - Yeah. Uh, can you manage the store, Rose? My pleasure! Sam? Sam? I'm back! Hold out your arms! Guess who? Oh! Ba-aarbara? Oh! She's gorgeous! She's so soft! Yeah, 'cause she's all wool. Oh, beautiful girl! She's gorgeous! To Ba-aarbara! Now, Col has managed to source us a very special seafood delicacy. Oh, yum! Paua! Uh... Oh! God, I'm sorry. That's... - It's fine! - It's black! It's supposed to be! It has the most beautiful shell. Yeah. Here, look. See this? It's made out of paua shell. Pretty, huh? Yeah. Oh, and it tastes delicious! Try this! Oh, um... Oh! That is amazing! And so are you. I mean, the photos. It really is a good idea. Well, I do have the occasional one. You and Ba-aarbara, great social media posts! Pics with animals always get a lot of likes and interest. Probably need about 4 of those. And, uh, oh... Thanks. The shots are great, again! Well, hey, had a good subject. Ba-aarbara! Yeah, I'll pull some prints together. Try to post every day leading up to the weekend. It'll help with the turnout at the market. I will. Thanks, Sam. Well, to quote Col: "Sweet as, bro." Hey, Chris. Soph, I've been trying to get ahold of you. I know. I'm sorry. Look, I think we made a mistake. We? Me, I... I made a mistake. Can we just... - Chris, I... - No, no, no, Soph, please. Just hear me out, OK? Just give me a chance. Thanks again for letting us use it. Oh, no problem. You know, I think I might actually leave it like that. Hey, I'll get you the last batch of yarn. - You should take it with you. - Oh, great! Hi! Good day, love! It's a wee bit early, I know, but, uh, I'm looking for Mr. Samuel King. Here to measure up the fiber milling gear. Oh, you're... Are you gonna buy it? Well, that's the idea. He gave me a new price, so I'm here to sign off. Just need to make sure it's in working order and measure it for transport. You work here? I... I... I used to help out around the place. Great! So, uh, where can I find Mr. King? - Want me to take both? - No, no, no. I can take that. That's Mr. King, right over there. Thanks! Have a good day! Hey, one minute. Sophie! Sophie! Hey! I can explain. You didn't even give me a chance! Hey! Sophie! Oh! Chairs have been picked up. Volunteers are ready to go. I think we're all set! Has anyone seen Glenda? Oh, she took off last night. She's disappeared! But, hey, Soph, look at all these donations! Great! But it doesn't matter anymore. There's no point! Sam's selling the mill to someone else. What? He can't do that! He can do what he likes. He has made that perfectly clear. This is just business. Soph, regardless, your friends put so much hard work into this, and love. It'll still be a great promotion for the shop, hey? Yeah. Yeah, you're right. And Samuel's gone to so much trouble for us. Maybe it isn't what you think. These are amazing, Ida. You... you really are an artist. Actually, that's not mine. That's hers. I really messed up, huh? I mean, Sophie's never gonna trust me again. I don't know. But what I do know is you have to start trusting this, like she does. Admit it! You've fallen in love with this place, Sam, just like I did. I can see it, even if you can't. Listen to this. Maybe this was your path all along. What do I do? An explanation is a good start. Oh, Kyle, have you seen Sophie? Yep! Hey, Chris! Nice of you to come. I wanted to wish you good luck. I... I was hoping maybe we could hang out later. What's Chris doing with Sophie? Thought they'd split. Guess not, hey? No... The Homespun knitting contest starts on the stage in one hour. Come see me to sign up. I want to fix this. I've missed you, a lot. That's really sweet, Chris. We are gonna have to talk later. I have a contest to run. With a bit of rearranging in the stock room, this place will fit the milling machines and still have room for the knitting club. You shouldn't have those keys. Perks of the trade! Changed a bit, hey? It's normally full. They're all at the market. All these years... Haberdashery, patterns, buttons... Tiddlywinks. You're a very cunning woman, Glenda. And persuasive. I got you on that plane, didn't I? Only so I can deal with this mill foolishness. Oh, come on, Liz! It's a great idea! You should be supporting her. It's a huge risk! I remember a certain young woman who wanted to open her own real estate office. Her parents didn't approve of that, but she did it anyway, and look at her now. Sophie is just as passionate about this place as you are about your work. She's more like you than you know, Liz. You did not enter me in this! Oh, yes, I did! The knitting contest starts in one minute! Come on! Just relax, enjoy yourself. Hello, everyone! I'm Sophie Markham, the owner of Homespun in Kingsvale! Thank you! Today's contest is not one of skill. It is one of speed. Whoever can knit the longest scarf in an hour wins. OK, so, as I was saying, it doesn't have to be the most beautiful scarf or the most technical. You just have to... Mom? What? Ha! What... Uh, sorry, um... Surprise contestant! Ladies and gentlemen, all the way from LA, my mom! Uh, OK. This is just about using your two needles and some of this home-milled King Yarn to knit the longest scarf you possibly can. Room for one more? Yep! Today's prize is very special. King Yarn won't be around for much longer. I milled this batch... the last one ever. OK, when I say go, you can start knitting. Three, two... Mom! - Not yet, Mom. - Oh, sorry. One, go! Come on, Sam! Come on, Sam! Come on, Liz! Let's go! Whoo! Come on, Liz! You can do it! I didn't know you had it in you. We're into the final straight, and the needles are flying! We've got serious competition. Kyle the Baker in the home stretch. Lucy-Goosey picking up the pace. Christopher and King Samuel neck and neck, which is handy, 'cause it's a scarf. Pride of LA is battling away. Big Hands Col is charging down the back straight. But here we go! It's over to the stewards now! OK! Everyone, 10... 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1! Needles down! Mom, needles down! Uh... Ah, Lucy! - That's amazing! - Thank you! Wow! Ten... Ah, Mom! All right. Wow! Hmm... Um, OK, everyone, in first place with an impressive 22 inches, Lucy Collins! Congratulations! I told you! And in second place, the most unlikely of knitters with probably the messiest and ugliest piece, my mother, Liz Markham! See? You can knit! Thank you for coming. It is so good to see you. You too, darling. Congratulations on all this! Thank you! - Oh, I'll do it! - Oh! Oh! Ow! And in third place, Samuel King, King Farm's financial advisor. Congratulations. The last of the yarn. A memento. Sophie... Well, thank you, everyone, for coming! Hope to see you all at Homespun. No speed knitting required! Well, I'm a terrible knitter, but it was a lot of fun. Well, maybe you just need more lessons. Yeah. I... I'd like that, more lessons. Oh, but that's all it would be, Chris. I'm happy to be friends, but that's all. I'm sorry. Yeah, I understand. I just want you to be happy, Soph. Excuse me, Sophie. Can we talk? You're not gonna believe this. Uh... Believe what? It's your mom. Come and see. She is not trying to sell my store, is she? I can so see her doing that! It's gorgeous! Your mom had the highest bid! Oh, wow! Thanks, Mum! It looks great. No, you don't get it. She bid high. Mum... This is way too much! You didn't have to. - "Mom..." - No, you can't! I can and will. Think of it as an apology. I see the community you've built around this business. And what kind of mother would I be if I didn't help you keep it alive? You can repay me in knitting lessons. How about that? - Thank you! - I love you. Love you. This is huge. Now you can buy the equipment! The mill is yours. Except you're forgetting. Sam already sold it. Has it gone yet, though? Maybe you can outbid this other buyer now. Rose, I'm not gonna beg him! Oh, come on! If the immovable Liz Markham can come around, so can her daughter. Just give him a chance to explain. Samuel... Let's go get some air. I would like to make an official offer on the mill, a higher bid, if that's needed. - Sophie, can I just explain? - What's to explain? It's all about the bottom line. I haven't sold the mill. Yes, I lined up a buyer, not long after I got here, but then I got to see how deeply Ida feels about all of this: the... the farm, everything. God, she loves this place. And I... I realized she'd do anything to keep it in the family. Yeah. And then you and I started to get to know each other. And I could see you'd done exactly the same thing: fallen in love and stayed. So, I changed my mind. I... I don't understand. You offered that guy a better price! No, I didn't. I called him and told him the price had gone up. It... it's just... I don't know. He turned up today to try and change my mind, but I already knew. The equipment, the yarn, the last mill, it all belongs to you. So, I said no. And I stole the needles out of your car, so, uh... So, the mill, it's still for sale, to me? Yeah. OK! This is my mother's investment in me. So I am going to use it to pay for that equipment. OK... Partner. Partner? But aren't you going back to New York? No, I'm not. I've kind of fallen in love myself. With this place, you know. I have to get used to the speed-limit signs and maybe help Col deliver a lamb or two. What is your father gonna say about you not going back? I'll handle my father. You know, I'm gonna do what I want to do. Right now, it's making you some fine, fine merino wool, 17 microns. It'll be nice to be around you still, even if we're just friends. Just friends? Yeah, well, I, uh, I saw you with Chris before, so... Oh, no, Sam, Chris is great. But we're not getting back together. No, I need to be with someone who gets me. You get me. You would do anything to help me and the business. You care about what I do. It's you I want to be with. OK. That's good. Because... I finally figured out what I want too. You. Hey! Mum, this is Sam. We are going to be business partners. Looks like more than that to me! I hope you can help my daughter make Homespun bigger and better, then, Sam. She deserves it. She certainly does. Oh! And I think you deserve this. It'll look much better on you. Oh, he's a Kiwi! It's perfect. Sophie, I think you just officially ended the sweater curse. I think you might be right, Glenda. Lovely! A well-made jersey is like a well-made loaf of bread, both crafted with love and each perfect in their own particular way. Hmm. Biscuits? He speaks! - That was very eloquent, Kyle. - Yep! Well done! - Oh! - Thank you! - Biscuit? - Oh, nice! Yeah. Hi! Hey, Mum! - Hi, darling! - Hey! Guys, come check these out! So, this is where the mill and carders and tumblers and tubs are gonna go. - Sweet as! - Stock can come in here? Hi! Say hello to Homespun's newest mascot! Ba-aarbara? Yeah, making her debut! She's all yours. I don't know what to say! Don't say a thing. She'll be available for special events, photo shoots, picnics, weddings... And she'll live at the farm, so you'll get to see her every day. You know exactly who I am, don't you? I do. And you're exactly who I want. - Aw! - Aw!
