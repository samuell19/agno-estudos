I don't smoke, but boy, do I suck! Like a Vosges candy! -The Pope wants to celebrate the reconciliation of the 2 blocs. -He launches the project of a symbolic meeting, on his balcony, between Reagan and Gorbachev. -But he ends up with Bush and Yeltsin. -Instead of Gorbachev, it's not Yeltsin, but 15 heads of state who claim legitimately to shake hands with Reagan and receive the blessing and the welcome from the papal balcony. In the wake, all religious leaders want to represent their constituents alongside Reagan and His Holiness. -Betty Dodson is a professor of masturbation. They are gathered here… -To not give up on his project, the Pope celebrates the reunification of the world with a representative from each continent and the Secretary-General of the UN by honoring the poor of the world. Let us recognize the poor." -Hence the title of the ceremony… -What are you doing? -"Pauperes honoremus." -That's the news. -Come. Come on, old man. Come on. -Did you know Jacques came? -With… -No. Alone. -What is he advocating for now? -That's all over. He's in TV production. -No? -Yes, indeed. -Jacques, you're here? I thought you were at the zoo. Oh, but tell me, you haven't changed. Are you in the audiovisual field? -Yes. -Still involved in good things. -I hope to do less harm to humanity by dumbing it down than by advocating for its fulfillment. -Do you remember Kornfeld? I talked about him all the time. Here he is. More flesh than bone. Kornfeld, the specialist in Marxist analysis of the economy of the East. -Where are our 20 years? -We got it all wrong, but we had fun. -…Knight of Arts and Letters. -You deserve the "Legion of Horror". I'll send you a form. -No, don't bother. -You refuse? -No, but… -Do you remember Bouju? -Who? -Bouju, the philosophy teacher. We sang The Internationale to him! -No, I don't. Maybe it wasn't with you. -Who's thar guy? -What guy? -We were in high school, right? -"In high school"? No. Economics at the university, right? -The guy who walks around with a tray. -Wait… I never studied at Sciences Po. -He's my wife's Polish husband. -Is he "Polish Polish"? -What do you mean, "Polish Polish"? -Gentile? -As gentile as can be. -I've prepared clean glasses. -Thank you. -Are you Polish? I love Poland and the Polish people. I'm a friend of Henri and Barbara. Jacques. But they call me "Jack" because of… Do you speak French? Ah, very good. -Not very good. I still have an accent. -Hardly noticeable. Besides, it's very nice. -Help yourself. -Thank you. Cheers! -Zdrowie. -"Zdrowie." How do you see, over there, the future of…Well, the evolution? -Come on, another one. -Go on, another one. -Don't drink in the hallway. We're not in Poland. -No. We're discussing politics. -Is she making fun of me? -You're made for each other. A little while ago, you were still a little red around the edges. -I was a Castroist and Maoist. Well, very little. With Henri, in 1968. Barbara mixes all that up a bit. Now, I am MRG. -Sorry? -It doesn't matter. Tell me, your brother-in-law… -Which "brother-in-law"? -Oh, sorry. Your husband's… Your Polack, there, politically. -He runs the international of complainers. -I see. -No, you don't see. -That's not true! -Cholera! -What's wrong with you, again? -I don't know what's wrong with everyone tonight, wanting to talk politics. -Leave it. Stan, don't stay here. Have fun. Talk to the others. There are very nice people. -I have nothing to say. -Neither do they. We talk out of politeness. -"Out of politeness"? -Fine. Don't talk then. Go with the others and eat without talking. -When there are many, it bothers me… -We force ourselves a little. -Out of politeness. I like leftovers. Do you want me to help you? -No. Stop playing the servant, it annoys me. Stan, it's full of single women, go. -I see that it's urgent, for me too, to return to the motherland. Bye-bye. I'm going home. -My will, as always. Only I always get stuck at the beginning. I bequeath. What do I bequeath and to whom? Bye, Henri. Happy birthday. -It's not my birthday. -Whose is it then? -Nobody's, damn it. -But why the celebration, then? -He annoys me. -The white wine glass, it brings good luck. -It's crystal. He annoys me. As soon as I see him, I get a lump in my throat. -Can you help me? -That's all I do. Who helps me? -Bring the candied fruits. -He still doesn't talk about leaving? -No. Hurry, it's melting. -We'll have him like this for years. -What would he do there? -What does he do here? -He writes. -There's no paper there? -Again… Damn it! -It's going to be okay. It's nothing. I'll take care of it. I'll take care of it. Sorry. -What is it? -I'll take care of it. It must be the circuit breaker. The meter is there. Here. Try the timer, it's on the left. -It smells burnt. -There it is. -There's smoke, there. What did that idiot do again? The timer. Are you okay? -I wanted to… I wanted to… There you go. -Yes, he wanted to… Should I call a doctor or emergency services? -It would be better to call an electrician. -I am at home, here. -It will be fine. -I know what I have to do. What's wrong? -Don't rush him. Can't you see he wanted to commit suicide? -What? -Go get Barbara, I'll stay with him. Go on, go. -It's the circuit breaker. Is there a doctor? -Why? -Truckner studied medicine. Now he's in the food industry. -We don't need a butcher. -There are days like that. -What's that smoke? -Is there a problem? -No, Mr. Bolde, it's fine. Thank you. -He tried to commit suicide. -My God. -Shit, not all at once. It's nothing, it's not serious. -What happened? -Hanged by an electrical wire. -It caused a power outage. -I smell something burning. -He also started a little fire. -No? -Yes. -I didn't think he was still so brave. How is he? -Still the same: very pleased with himself. -But why? You could have told us about it. -I didn't want to bother you for such a small thing. -"For such a small thing"… Stan. Even so. -He prefers to set the house on fire. A typical Polish delicacy. -Henri! -Maybe we should call for help. -Do you think there are psychiatrists roaming around at night with straitjackets? -Are you in pain? -What is he saying? -He's asking me if I know a black cat that roams the roof at night. -So? -I told him no. What do you want me to say to him? -"Black cat"… Let's take him to the hospital. -No, not the hospital. I feel fine. I feel very well and in good shape. -Are you standing up? -Yes. -Where are you going? -He's not going to stay here. -Well, wait. You're not going to let him go down like that in front of the guests. -Thank you. -Leave him in the kitchen. He'll scare the guests. -I ruined your birthday. -Did you see that? Do you think this idiot really wanted to hang himself with an electrical wire? -You know, when you get to that point… -When you get to what point? -To that point of despair. -You're not going to pity him? -Why not? -Communist. -You were too. -Not in a communist country. And a long time ago. You're not going to compare, are you? -No. People don't hang themselves in sordid maid's rooms. -"Sordid"? -Sordid. -It's just to help him out. He comes for 2 weeks, he stays for 2 years. I wanted to make my office or a studio for students. He was supposed to find a job, a good woman, be happy, and he hangs himself? Yes, I was scared that he would settle down, that's it. That he would settle down permanently. You don't know these people. They stick around for life. -My poor old man. -What? -When it comes to protesting or signing petitions, you're there. But when it comes to active, direct, human solidarity, well… -You can talk, too. Your wife's first husband never showed up. He was waiting for the kids downstairs. He had a cold all year round, that guy. -No relation. He has an allergy. That guy's a fascist. -I'm willing to shake hands with any victim, even a fascist, but him, he pisses me off. You see? He pisses me off. I'm sure he's a bit anti-Semitic, like all the Polacks. -Your wife is a Polack. -It's not the same. -You're turning into a complete asshole. -What? -Thanks for your delicacy regarding my wife. -Well, sorry. Excuse me. Did she really go back to him? -Shit! I've already told you, damn it… Not to talk to me about it, ever. Ever. -What can I do? -Let it be, it will pass. -No, not for you, for Stan. -Treat him like a human being. -Huh? -Help him. What's wrong with you? -Help him? To go back home? I'll write a check right away. -The typical proto-bourgeois! "A check." Don't you see that's what we're all dying from? The world is populated by check writers. And she knows that. She knows that, over there, they will become check writers without a soul, without ideals. -So let him stay. I'll settle him in Brittany, in the Basque Country, in a vibrant place. -No. It's over for him. The world is a dead end. Unlivable, unbreathable. What was he doing there? -Like here. -That is to say? -He was writing. -What was he writing? -I don't know. It's my wife who was married to him. Shit. Oh, shit. We'll have to get that fixed too, damn it. Leave it, I'll do the cleaning tomorrow morning. Shit… -"Here comes the end of the world." Provisional will. "Final draft." -Oh, shit. -Can I have another pillow? -Yes. -Are you sleeping? Neither am I… if you want to know everything. -It's terrible. -Yes, terrible. As soon as I doze off… -Another failure for him. All his friends have succeeded. Even drunk, they all made it on the first try. Marek threw himself down the staircase. Jerzy, he was our childhood friend. After being expelled from the Party, he hanged himself in the university locker rooms. And he has always been so clumsy. It's pathological. Sleeping pills. -I took one before going to bed. -You have to throw away all his medication when you have a desperate person at home. -Sorry, but besides me, there has never been a desperate person at my place. -The pillow. The problem is that if you don't take the right dose, you can just make yourself sick. His cousin Pavel was paralyzed for 7 months before he died. -Barbara? -Yes? -I promise to do everything I can to help him, and Jacques too. -Who's the idiot… -Hello? -Who is it? -Jacques who can't sleep. -Neither can we. -You think? He thinks we're wrong. -About what? -About Stan. He wants us to talk about it, the three of us. -Fine. Tomorrow. Good night. -Yes. Well. Well. If you want, yes. There's no need. There's plenty left from yesterday. OK. OK. -What do we have left from yesterday? -Bread. -"Bread"? -Yes. Is there any bread left? -Mountains. Why? -He wanted to get some bread, I told him there was some left. -When does he want to get it? -Right away. -"Right away"? -Yes. -He's pissing me off. -Me too. Since his wife left him, he's changed. -I don't care. You and your ex-communist friends, newly divorced depressives, you're starting to annoy me. At night, we sleep at my place. -Don't you think you're exaggerating? -No. We don't have the right. I can feel it. -Lemon? -Yes. No. Yes. We can't tell a man who has every reason to suffer that he no longer suffers. -Sweeten it. -Excuse me? -Sweeten it before stirring. -I take it without sugar, thank you. We have to offer him something concrete, something vital. So here's an idea I had. I couldn't sleep. It's as if… As if I were in his place, far from home, in exile, fleeing one country for another where I can't live. -There are many people who manage to live, even in Poland. -Maybe. So, I thought to myself: if he's a writer, he needs to get published. He's not published? Here? In France? -I've translated some texts. They've been rejected everywhere. -I know a lot of people, and even if it costs a little… -There's something worse than not being published, it's the absence of readers. -Why wouldn't he have readers? -No one knows him. -We can do some advertising. What's the risk? -What's the risk? -Shh… -Are you still eating? -No, we're just talking. -Ah. Sorry. Am I interrupting? -Not at all. We were talking about you and your… And I was saying how your act, isn't it? Moved me… How much I… Very, very touched. Sorry. I am completely on your side. Do you mind? -Well, I'm going back to bed. I heard some noise, so I… -Did we wake you up? Really sorry. -No, it's me who's… Do you have an aspirin? I feel a little sore. I couldn't find any in the bathroom. -You looked for it? -Yes. Wasn't I supposed to? -In France, aspirins are in the kitchen. -I didn't know. Thanks. It will go well with your… -Yes. He's a little disturbed, his wife left him. You know. He loves Poland so much. -It's effervescent. -No, the pill. -The pill, put it in the water. -Thanks. -Stanislas? -Yes? -We understand you, you know. We understand you. -Thanks. -It's terrible. We'll have to watch him day and night. Did you see how detached he became? I didn't know he was so strong. -Come on, Henri, my boy, get dressed! We're going for a jog. -He's sick. -Every morning, an old buddy of mine runs in Luco: Arnold. Have I already told you about Arnold? -No. -Yes! A former Maoist who became an expert in communication and then CEO of a publishing company. We're going to get a free consultation. -Doesn't he have a phone? -It takes 3 months to reach him. We'll corner him easily. Let's go. -But it's night. -"Night"?. It's 6:15. What time do the proletarians clock in? -Maybe they don't commit suicide at night in their country. -I always need a cause to serve, otherwise I get bored. Terrible, isn't it? Come on. It's him. The little one is Arnold. -I'll wait for you in the car. -No no! No no, damn it! It's me, Jacques! Jacquot Ché! -So? -He's waiting for us at the Senate restaurant. -Why? -Breakfast and business talk. -Again? -I think I made a good impression on him. Okay. Shall we go on foot? -No, no, by car. Did you explain everything to him? -I couldn't talk much, I'm out of breath. Did you see his bodyguards? Super efficient, right? In 1968, he was in charge of security. Impeccable. The cops applauded us as we passed by. -No, not him. Him, that's Henri. -The brother-in-law. Sorry. Let's eat. Let's not waste time. Tea? Coffee? -Tea. -The coffee is very good too. Go ahead, help yourself. -When can Henri… -The brioches are delicious. -When can Henri deliver the texts to you? Well, what is translated, of course. -No need. The Polack is no longer a carrier. The former opponents don't give a damn. They won, didn't they? -Not him. He's more like a political refugee, isn't he? -Communist? -When he was young, he was in the opposition, but as he got older, out of snobbery, he changed sides. -What to do with a former communist? -Desperate, too. -Really desperate? -Suicidal. He hanged himself and set his stool on fire. -No, my stool. -Did he set it on fire, yes or no? -Absolutely, yes. -We thought that publishing it would give him hope. -How old is he? -Let's say like us. -Yes. -It's over for him. He's done for. Let him hang himself. -That is to say, his wife… Finally, Henri's wife cares about him. And ourselves… we said that if his life depended on the release of a book… -Have you read The Little Apocalypse? A Polish novel published by Laffont. -His wife must have read it. -My wife is… -I understood. In this book, that I was told about a guy, a writer, a Pole, precisely, who sets himself on fire in front of the Central Committee of the Communist Party. Do you follow me? -Perfectly. It's the story of a guy who burns himself. -Exactly. -Yes. And why does he burn himself? -Why do people burn themselves? Because they are desperate, like your Pole. -Of course. -They do it in public to attract attention. If he had balls, instead of doing it stupidly at home, he would do it publicly, live, during the news. His books, afterwards, would sell for 3, 4 days. -Where? -What, "where"? -There is no more Central Committee. -Take a walk. We'll meet at the car. 3 minutes. Did you follow, at the Vatican? My group is ready to make an effort to cover the Honorum Poperum. -Honoremus Pauperes. -Yes. By positioning ourselves like everyone else, resolutely for it. But if we had the exclusivity of your… We could be resolutely against it. Do you see that? The Pope blessing the poor. The leaders of the world praying: "Good Holy Father, give us a century of stock market stability." "Forgive us a century of ideal social justice." And in the midst of this solemnity, our Pole, our desperate man stands up, lights a match and poof! No. It's not 3, 4 days of sales, it's the beginning of media guerrilla warfare, the beginning of the new strategy of reversal. It's the means to give a voice back to the voiceless, the oppressed, the hungry, right? In the silence of the satiated, an incandescent voice cries out: Does he have an agent? -Excuse me? -The desperate man, does he have an agent? -Not that I know of. -Then you will represent him. You should negotiate discreetly the multimedia adaptation rights of this Little Apocalypse. So that the author doesn't bother us with his moral rights. Now, I still have to meet your protégé. Is the man reliable? -Absolutely. -At noon at my place, would that work? -Uh… noon? Yes. Why not? Noon. -It will be difficult to set up in such a short time. In the meantime, complete secrecy. The sharks will quickly steal a good idea from us and turn it into crap. No, stay. And there you go, you think you're old, definitely recovered, and one beautiful morning, you realize that you're not. -It's great. -I disagree. -What? -I don't agree. I am resolutely, unconditionally, for the peaceful rapprochement of all countries, with or without a Pope, and for the rich countries to honor the poor countries. -But who is against it? -He is. -We ask him for a solution for Stan, he finds it for us, period. What's wrong with you? -He stressed me out, your guy. And what if he doesn't want to? -Who? -Stan. -What? -What if he doesn't want to? -Doesn't want what? You're annoying. Why wouldn't he want to? -I don't know. He might be scared. -He tried to hang himself, didn't he? And to… -Me, I would be scared. -You, you… I'm driving. -You're arriving on time. What kind of distribution is this accommodating publisher considering? -A worldwide distribution, with a very high circulation. -We'll help you. -No. There's coffee, croissants. Does he know Stan's work? -He doesn't deal with the literary aspect of things. It's the strategic side that interests him. -Tell me, have you read La Petite Apocalypse? -By Konwicki? -I'm not asking you who it's by, I'm asking if you've read it. -What's wrong with him? -His ulcer. Where was I? -Strategy. -Ah, yes. His thing is simple, The author, finally, Stan, in this case, instead of doing it stupidly, like yesterday, in a room, will do it in public, in Saint Peter's Square in Rome, during the ceremony that will conclude the ecumenical meeting of the summit, under the eyes of millions and millions of potential readers. -There you go. -It won't work. -Listen, this guy is used to it, he's not a jokester. -It's not this guy, it's Stan. -But we'll help him this time. He brings his unwavering will to end it, and we provide the logistics. -And if he has another failure? Public, this time? -Lighting a match is not rocket science. I can do it myself. He looks fine, doesn't he? -That's despair. -Yes. -Hello. Hello, how are you? Did you sleep well? There are nights like that. -A coffee? -I'll make it. -No, I'll bring it to you. Coffee? -Yes. Coffee, yes. -Well, we, Barbara, Henri and I, right? We are… How to say… focused on your case. Knowing that if you had taken action with this determination, it could only be after careful consideration. Also… we will not subject you to a sermon, or give you false hope of a bright future. On the other hand, I know despair too intimately not to respect scrupulously your choice and your determinations. Only… Only, you are… How to say… Yes, an artist, a writer, a lucid and desperate poet, indeed. As such, we believe it would be an intolerable waste to let you go like this… How to say… fruitlessly. Henri and I are not idle, and we have negotiated with a publisher… A big publisher, a very big publisher… -Huge. -…an agreement for the publication and distribution of your complete works. -"Complete" works? -If you don't want to, it's up to you. We will establish a volume of selected pieces, a kind of potpourri. If you don't have time, Barbara will do it. -I have all the time, but who will be interested in this "potpourri"? -Have you read La Petite Apocalypse? -By Konwicki? -Beautiful book, isn't it? -Yes. Everyone says that, yes. -Please, it's already difficult enough. Do you mind? The publisher's idea, who is an expert in communication, is unbeatable. The whole world, believe me, will clamor for your work. Its worldwide release will be preceded by your public holocaust… in Saint Peter's Square in Rome, live on the day when His Holiness receives the leaders of rich countries and honors the poor. We will divert this great media event and it will give you millions of potential readers, touched to the core, choked up. Do you follow me? -What is he saying there? -He's asking what "holocaust" means. -So what? -It's the same as in Polish. What's wrong, why are you rubbing yourself? -Listen, I'll tell you… Thank you. -No. No, don't thank us. You are no longer alone, Stan. You are no longer alone. In this dehumanized world, you are no longer alone in protesting. We are with you. With you. There are days, me too, I… But I don't have your courage. -All right. Stay with him. Uh… Stay with Jacques. OK? Good. He is emotional. He has never been lucky with women. The last one… I'll tell you about it another time. Shave, huh? Well, no, actually, don't shave. Do whatever you want. The important thing is that you look like… how you are. -Are you okay? -I'm okay. And you? -Was there a fight here? -No, I started the fire. But it was not on purpose. -What are you doing? -I'm selecting. -What are you doing?. -I'm selecting. Potpourri. -That I have already translated twice. -No! Leave that! Leave that! Bastard! -Leave that bird, you damn bastard! -Oh, shit! Oh, shit. Wait. Here, take it. We got you! -Let go of me! -We got you. -Please. -Let go of me! You bastards! -We'll set you up downstairs while we sort everything out. -No, it's fine. -We can't rent in this condition, we need to do the repairs. -It's the cat. -Stan, please… -Yes, yes. -We need something dressy for this appointment. -Yes. That's enough. Henri… Henri, do you know the big black cat that eats birds up there on the roof? -I really don't feel like joking. Come on. -I'm disappointed. Terribly disappointed. -But why?. -He has no presence. -He's not Robert Redford, of course, but he has a certain charm. -He embodies nothing! Nothing! He doesn't even look Slavic. -You think so? -I much preferred the other one. -Which other one? Henri? -Yes, the brother-in-law. At least he looks desperate. -But the volunteer is the other one. -That's a shame. And very poorly dressed. He looks like a sack. -It's a jacket of mine. -We'll make do. We'll show him as little as possible beforehand. Wait. Take care of them. No. Stay, you. -Smile. No, don't smile. -"Formation of a private company whose purpose will be the editing, publishing, and promotion of works and publications as well as their derivatives by Mr. Stanislas Marek." Put the exact name. Followed by your 3 names, titles, etc., your initials and mine. "On the other hand, we, Arnold Cassagne, declare that we have received and have given receipts to the parties for the checks… Done in Paris, etc." -Thank you, Dubois-Dufour. I have made the decision, which I put to a vote, to control everything financially and legally, needless to say. The financial proceeds, all the financial proceeds, will go towards a foundation in his name intended to support, finance, promote original and unconventional anti-media actions. No objections? Good. I have prepared a brief summary. Firstly: the need to have a team experienced in live broadcasts on the ground. We'll have a brilliant American. -Sigmund Fleish. -Secondly, we must, in order to correct the terrifying absence of your presence… obtain the best possible video clip. The best studio in the world is in England. We'll have it. Thirdly, the paper. The book must be simple, on fireproof bible paper to continue to captivate the imagination, right? First, we'll have the live broadcast with the clip, Then, the movie, the TV series. As for the book…. -Barbara, his wife… Henri's wife, is working on the translation. -100 copies. 3 days to set up in major European stores a 2,000-page book. -The check, how much? Good. It didn't go too bad, huh? Oh yes, here. Some pocket money. In your situation… treat yourself. -What is it? -Your translators. Do you want to see them? -No. -Can you sign this for me? It's a receipt for accounting. -Yes. -Thank you. The pen. I'm going back to the office, I have a crazy job. Treat yourself. -I translate into French. Thank you. (They speak Uzbek.) -Sir, the door is fixed. The ladder too. -Don't catch a cold. I'll pick you up at the café. Pitchik! Pitchik! Here are some images for good children. Goddamn it, I'm breaking down the door! -Leave him. He's sick, he's going to die. I have a business proposal for him. A beautiful proposition, my dear. I came to help you. Where is the master? -He's very sick. -I want to evoke the good old days. -Who still thinks about all that, professor? -Who says otherwise? But remember: I excluded you, afterwards. -Everyone there turned their back on me. Here, they piss on me. Everyone! They were in the opposition before me, big deal! I licked Soviet dishes, they licked capitalist dishes. But licking is always licking, right? Leave us! What are you doing here? -Darling, where do you want me to go? -To the toilet! "Darling"! On the landing! -Don't get upset. You see, you're making him sick. -"Darling." She's always there, listening to conversations! It's over now! Over! No need to memorize anymore! So, what about you, Stan? Are you still working for them? For me, it's over. I'm a squeezed lemon. Even my seeds are eaten. -Fine. Comrade professor, honorable chief philosopher, distinguished Leninist, would you like us to publish your complete works in French, English, German, Polish? Here's an advance on your royalties. It's just the beginning, comrade. -Excuse me, there is a condition. Do you remember The Little Apocalypse? -Listen, you're old, sick, worn out. This proposal is the end of your material worries and glory for you. -Where do they want me to burn? -At the Vatican. Have you ever been to Italy? I hear it's very nice. Anna can accompany you. -For what? -What do you mean, "for what"? -Why do they want me to burn myself? -To protest, no doubt. -"Protest" against what? -Against everything. There's no shortage of subjects to protest. -Sophism, post-romantic nihilistic gibberish. -They are very competent people who love Poland and the Polish people. -Ah, Westerners? -Yes, Westerners. -Tell them that Pitchik is ready to burn alive. With pleasure, even. But certainly not in public, and even less to protest. -Why? It's petty. -All my life, I worked for others, building socialism, etc. etc. -Me too, but it's over. You have to live with the times. It's every man for himself now. -Exactly. I'm going to die for myself, selfishly. -Think about your wife, your work, your genius. -Anna can always go back to Poland. As for my work, I carefully shit on it. -Listen. It's ridiculous to refuse such a proposal. I'll leave you the money. It's a first installment. -No. It's no! Go! Go tell the authorities that citizen Pitchik, now free, is going to kill himself very soon, and that his death will bring them nothing. Nothing. It's the song of the dockers It's the song of all the proletarians Do you remember? -We can't talk with this idiot. Say something, you. -Do you hear those dockers… -100 francs. It's worth 200. I'll let you have it for 100 francs. -for peace More life for war -Cover yourself, you'll catch a cold. -…send our boys -Well, is that your final answer? -My final one! And put the traitors in prison It's the song of the dockers It's the song of all the proletarians -Are you crazy? -Shut up, you! -…who will pay for the housing of the poor? -Without the presence of the poor, the ceremony would lose its symbolism. -Exactly. -So? -Let's keep our fingers crossed. -Could the ceremony still be postponed? -It wouldn't have the ecumenical character, globalist and universal that the Pope wants. -Good luck to the HolyNFather, and may God be with him on the road. And Bison Futé? -It's going to be difficult to reach Rome this weekend, even if all roads lead there. -Bison Futé… -An American director. Here you are. American television. -Where is he? -Not with you? -No. We were with Arnold. In terms of organization, we're hopeless, we won't make it. -Don't worry, we've planned everything. His physiotherapist follows Stan everywhere. -He's coming. He's coming. -You can already film this. -Don't you have anything more Parisian? -There's a maid's room. -Sordid. -It's this way. Out. All 3 of you, get out. (He speaks Uzbek.) -Damn, I forgot the workers. -Is it solid? -Uh… Yes. -Yes. We repaired it well. -No, I don't appreciate being followed. I'm used to it, but I don't appreciate it. -It's out of friendship, come on, not to watch you. -I had to wait for this guy all the time. -It'll be fine. Go up, sir. You too, madam. -Stan wanted to throw himself under a car. I'm the one who saved him. -Take your cat in your arms. -It's not my cat. -All writers have one. It's good for their image. -I hate cats, I'm not a writer and I don't care about my image. It's Polish humor. -Damn cat! Bird eater! -Stan, come back. Listen, all the translators are excited about your texts, about their modernity as well. Excited. -I have nothing to do with that overly skinny guy anymore, too young, who wrote that at night, on returning from work. -Stan… -Oh, Stan! -One minute. -We don't have time for that. -We're coming. -Barbara, do you remember that bridge over the Vistula? I told you that if you didn't kiss me right now, and if you didn't swear loyalty to me for life, I would jump. Do you remember? -Stan… -Well, I swear to you, Barbara, on the most precious thing I have in the world, on your head, Barbara, even standing on the parapet, I had no intention of doing it at all. Not for a second. I was already cynical, Barbara, and already a coward. Terribly cowardly. -Stan, stop. I know you better than you know yourself. -I don't believe that, Barbara. We need to talk. We have to. -They're waiting for us. And I have a surprise for you. Barbara… -Yes, Stan. Yes, but not here, of course. Behave. -Arnold explained your plan to me. Grandiose. We need to put an end to the primary humanitarian discourse. It's you… -No, it's his… -Me too, I traveled the globe with a kit to help. Futile. Do you know how many children will die from malnutrition in the next 10 years? Huh? 100 million. If we can't eradicate the causes of pain, we must eliminate it, pain, medically. Eliminating pain is to establish social equality, abolish poverty, hunger. -Absolutely. -Rich nations cannot ensure a decent life, but they can ensure a painless death for all. Chinese? Economically, they're holding up. Huh? -Absolutely. -Look. Look at this Chinese being sliced up. He's smiling, right? So? I concluded that pain, like the so-called real world, is just a product of the mind, isn't it? So all we have to do is interrupt the connections between the vectors of information and the receptors that transmit pain, cortex, hypothalamus, while releasing endogenous opioids. I'm simplifying, of course. In short, I'm about to succeed, but the globe-trotting buddies who do humanitarian work don't see it in a good light, nor the ethics committee, nor the hierarchy, nor the Pope. Honoremus Poperum. -Pauperes. -Excuse me? No… -I've developed… I've developed a biological molecule. The man will suffer, but his brain won't tell him anymore. It will be administrable like a vaccine. Entire continents immune to pain, indifferent to their own misfortune. Incredible, isn't it? In the meantime, I entrust you with these samples in various packagings. Start preparing the patient with drops, and before the action, the massive dose by subcutaneous injection, in the buttocks, anywhere. Ah, Arnold promised me to let the media know that your man kept smiling while burning thanks to my little product. -Absolutely. -That will shut up some assholes who whisper behind my back. -Are there any side effects? -It can amplify the pain at first, but it will pass. Gentlemen, let's get into action! -Doctor, your pencil… -Oh yes. That's the problem. After a while, you don't feel anything anymore. It still hurts, though. Is it alcohol? -Does it sting? -A little. No alcohol. Let him spray with any lubricant. Avoid synthetic materials. Use virgin wool, cotton. And above all, prevent others from extinguishing it, OK? Otherwise, afterwards, it's… -You don't like it? -No, thank you. -It's not good? -I asked you for Vichy carrots. -I wouldn't mind another tear. -I would like to be a little bit alone. I have a little text to write. -Do you want us to leave the kitchen for you? Or for the others to clear the living room? -I prefer my room. -It's all messy up there. -Exactly. I'm going to try to tidy up all this. -If he could write a text about his motivation, the nature of his protest. -Our Holy Father wanted this ceremony to celebrate with us. -"Dear Barbara," "Henri." -He could have stayed a little longer with us for the last evening. I need to talk. -Talk about what? -The world has become so… What happened? -Darling… -What happened? -Do you often have this kind of questioning? With tears? -No, never. It happened to me just now, while reading The Little Apocalypse. I was laughing, laughing and suddenly I wondered why the world has become what it has become. -Shall I make tea? -I'll make it. Go take care of him. -Go see a therapist. -You think so? -Damn it! We didn't give him his sedative. -Should we take some ourselves to see if it works? -What is it? -A pain eraser. -A damn drug, yes. -In small doses, you know… Not bad. It tastes like aspirin. -You should bring him some tea later and… -No. -The doctor said to prepare it. -He doesn't need it. -It's to help him. -That's what they say and then you can't do without it. -It works, you know. I feel even more stupid than usual. I'm in great shape. And my ulcer… -"I just wanted to change a light bulb." What does man seek, if not light? "To get out… of darkness… there… the goal… of all life. So I too… awkwardly… tried… without success… to…" -No, no, no. I'm not finished, I'm struggling. Sorry. -No, it's me. Forgive me. You don't need all these gymnastics anymore to express your feelings. Forgive me. Goodbye. Drink the tea. Don't drink too much vodka. -Why? Does it clog the arteries? -What is he doing? -He's writing, -Is he going to do something stupid? -The physiotherapist is downstairs. Should we ask him to come in front of his door? -You again? Bastard. -What do you want? -It's a very urgent and very important matter. -Oh! Are we dealing with underwear business? -I am just one of your obscure but very attentive readers, comrade author. The comrade vice-consul asks if it's really urgent. -In my position, we don't rub our noses with garlic. I have dinners. -I know. So, what do you want? What are you selling? -I want to contribute to its recovery and the construction of a market economy. Finally… I'm homesick. That's it. -My passport. -It's no longer valid. -What do you mean? What is it? I don't have a passport anymore? -But I absolutely have to go back. I'm interested in the development of a social capitalism with a human face. -No need for your shit about social capitalism. We need raw materials, skilled labor, and good managers. Can you make shoes? Do you have a computer? Then go back to your country, welcome. But if you're going to rant and criticize or praise the system, no need for you. Shut up! Servant. -Huh? -No. Out! (In German) Out! Quickly! 1, 2, 3! Out! "Political asylum"! Insane asylum, yes! When we arrived, there was no one there. The ladder was down. -Where are you going? -To see if the black cat is there. -We need to talk. -You shouldn't have let him go! -I didn't know. -You accepted a responsibility… -I didn't accept anything. I'm not responsible for it! -You're never responsible. In 1968… -You've always been great at messing up the world. Stop the music! You should have watched him yourself. -The division of tasks. -That was your plan. -But he's your wife's husband, not mine! Should we inform Arnold? -Where is he? -In Rome. Where else would he be? He's setting up the logistics. -He passed by here. There's his suitcase. -He went up to kill himself, to suffer no more. You should never try to help people. -Stop being negative, damn it. When someone wants to kill themselves, they don't bring luggage. -Are you up there? -Where were you? We were worried sick! -He's here? Finally, there you are. Shall we get familiar? -If you want. I bought you matches. -There's a tobacco shop downstairs. -I wanted the Polish matches. A gift. -That's not all, we're expected. -Just a small problem. I come from the consulate. -Which consulate? -From the Polish consulate. And as a Polish citizen, I cannot leave France without the consent of the consulate. -And where is the problem? -They took away my identity papers. -But on what grounds? -Just like that. -Can't they give you a temporary card? -Yes, but not before 6 weeks. Still defeated by bureaucracy. Look at my papers. (He speaks Italian.) Me, not European, me, Polish. -Cinema? -Yes, "cinema". -Not an actor, Polish. -Stop it! -I'm not French. -What does it matter? -I'm Polish. Even if I am an assimilated Pole. -But we'll talk about that later. Move on. -Incompetents. At home, they stare into your eyes, and even when you're in order, you feel cold down to your pants and your socks. -No, but he left, there. -Stan? -Stan? -Stan? -Stan! -Stan? But where have you been? -I took a trip to Poland. -Let's hold hands. -What happened? -I feel sick. -Me too, I feel sick. -Let's keep going, hold on. -In 5 hours, it's over. -For him. -I'm fed up, if you want to know. Seriously. -Come on, Stan, get in. (He speaks Italian.) It's Yanek Pomerantz. He is the greatest specialist in the prehistory of socialism. -Stan! -Let him get in. Let's not waste time. -Come on, get in, sir. Hurry up. -Thank you. Good day. Cheers. Stan! Gentlemen? Gentlemen, stop stop. Tomatoes! -What is he saying? I don't understand. -He's talking about mozzarella. -He's speaking Polish. Bye. Bye. Bye. …for the windshield… -Come on, come on. So? -I'll explain to you later. -I had to rehearse without you. -Hello. -Stan. Stan. Stan. Hello, Margot. -Jacques. -Alberto. -Stan. It's Stan. -Hi, Francesco. -Which one is he? Frank. -Ladies and gentlemen, dear colleagues, friends and associates, it is with gratitude that I say to the one we will accompany: friend, we will continue your work. We will spread your writings, your thoughts everywhere, always. 1 pater, 2 ave, 3 signatures at the bottom of a parchment, the fools who govern us thought they could make us forget the tremendous responsibility of the people of the world in the triple failure, economic, ecological, moral, where their incompetence has plunged us. Today, they want us to endorse their so-called status quo. The story is over for them and beginning for us. Today, all the media trying to permanently alienate the individual by delivering them to the wholly economic, to the tyranny of profit. Stan, through your very act, you tell us that resistance is possible, that it is a duty. You remind us that nothing is achieved without struggle. We will make your action the beacon of our guerrilla. We will turn around the opportunistic grand masses, remaining loyal to you. Thanks to you, we will be united and offensive once again. Thank you, Stan. Thank you. Come on, say something. -Where am I? Who are you? -I am your doctor. You had a fainting spell. Stress. -Where are the others? -Next door, in a conference. Last preparations. They asked me to take care of you. I admire you a lot. A lot. -Have you ever read anything of mine? -I never read. They always catch up with me. -But why? -They are so cowardly. -Why did you want to, you? -I hate life. I am young, rich, and beautiful, and I hate life. -No, not like that. -Shh…. -Not like that. Listen… I don't want to, that's it. I will save you. My life was aimless, so… Everything has changed. I will give you the taste of life, finally… It's bearable, isn't it? When you are rich, beautiful, and young? -What are you saying, you little scoundrel? Don't you want to die? -No, I want to die, but on the other hand, love. -"Love". Always this bullshit! He is on his feet. -Oh… -She is my daughter. -Ah…. -Red, green, or yellow? -Sorry? -The canister. Red, green, or yellow? -Not green. That's bad luck. -Red can be shocking. -Yellow, then. OK? Yellow? -Feeling better? -Where is Barbara? Why isn't she here? -She is taking care of your book. -It will be ready tomorrow. -I don't care. I want to see her. -She will see you on television. -Good. Shall we go? -Are we doing the injection here? -The physiotherapist. -What "injection"? -Relaxing. -No. There are limits to kindness. No injection. -It's for your comfort. -We never talked about an injection. -Look. I was a nurse in the army, I never got hurt. You see, it's nothing. I feel good. Come on, I'll prepare another one for you. -Can you do it for me, for my ulcer? -No. Not for Henri, this one. Not for Henri. It's for Stan. -No. For Stan. -No, give it to him. Give it. Oh… -There you go. -I prefer not to accompany you. You understand… Family ties. -OK, my big guy. Everything's fine. Shall we go? -So, Henri? Are you coming? -4. We only have 4 cameras. -The door. We are connected to 3 Italian cameras. -The Pope is late. -It's chaos everywhere. Well, in terms of organization. There is movement on the balcony. That's the Pope. -A priest with a microphone. -Open Jacques' microphone. -There they are. There they are. -Jacques? Jacques? Jacques, can you hear me? Open the sound. Is it working? Can he hear? Jacques? -I hear you loud and clear. This is Saint Peter. The cabin is yours. Rogers. -Who is Rogers? Don't push me, damn it! -They are our people. They're protecting us. -Ah. Thanks, people. -Are you hurt? -No, I don't like it. I hate crowds. People, all of that, I hate it. -Hello, Jacques? How are you? -There are a lot of people. -It's planned for. If you can, speed up, we're slightly behind schedule. -What's that? -I'm going to burn myself under the papal balcony because the world is ugly. -What are they doing? -It's that cop, there. -Show him your pass. Your pass! (They speak in Italian.) -Benzene, for the motorcycle. -What is your physiotherapist saying? He's useless! -Henri? Henri, are you there? -Yes. He wants to talk to you. -What does he want from me? -Go ahead. -Yes, Stan? -He can hear you, speak. -Henri, do you think Barbara will see us? -Yes. -Yes, my friend. Surely. -Tell Barbara that for last night, I am very sorry. -What are you sorry for, Stan? -Tell her that I'm sorry. She will know. -Well, excuse me. -Barbara? Barbara, can you hear me? Barbara, why did it go so wrong? Why? -Come. Come. Go ahead. Is something wrong? -I think I'm nervous. -Come on, we don't have much time left. Come on, let's move. -Keep walking! We're almost there. -Did we overdose him? -So what? We have to take him to the strategic point. In 30 seconds, we will be replaced by the 7 largest channels in the world. -No? -Yes. -And where is the physiotherapist? (Blessing in Latin) -Shit, the Pope. -They're approaching. Hurry up, damn it! -There's interference on the line. Repeat? -Let's go. Top! -OK, but it's crowded. -But it's expected. Let's follow the plan, that's it. He opens the can, you take out your matches. -They're out. -Then just tell him to open his can. -Open your can. -He can't do it. -Shit, the idiot. Jacques, unscrew it for him! -What? -Open his can for him, Jacques! -Jacques has always had a problem with action. He needs guidance. -Shit, the idiot. Jacques! Give him your matches, take his can! Open it! -We have 2 handicapped people in action. Jacques, an oil can unscrews in the opposite direction, Jacques! -On the other side! Unscrew it the other way! Give him back his can, take your matches. -The physiotherapist. Where is the physiotherapist? Damn it! -Don't worry about the physiotherapist! -It'll be fine. It'll be fine, don't get upset. Give back the can. Take your matches. Stan is dousing himself. You light the match. -Jacques! Light it! Light it, Jacques! Light it. -Douse yourself. -What's happening? This is not right. -What is this? -It's a mess. This is not right. -Turn it off, you damn idiots! It's the wrong one! -Leave me alone, for God's sake! -What the hell are you doing? -It's not you who should burn, it's the other one. -Jacques, what are you doing? -There's another one. -What is this? -I protest! -But what is this? -We have been betrayed, screwed over! There have been leaks! They stole my idea! -Stan? -Another one is burning under our windows. -Here. -What should I say to Barbara? -What am I going to do with these 100,000 books? -On the other hand, letting it wander here… -Move! -It's packed! It's not my fault if everyone loves the Pope! -The ravages of Bakunin. -If you're not happy, drive. "Bakunin"? What, again? -Democracy. Democracy! -But me too! Me too, -Well. We're all on edge, we've had a tough day. -There it is, it's moving. -I want to find that Polack. -When it's done, it's done, it's historic. There's nothing we can do about it. -What do I tell Barbara? -Don't just think about yourself. -Who do you want me to think about? -In 10 days, in Washington, the G7. -What's that? -The meeting of the 7 major countries. -And there, facing the White House… -A sacrifice by fire, it's devalued. -He will jump from one of our helicopters when the heads of state appear. -And where do you light him up? In the helicopter? -Damn, there it is, it's starting again. Get out of here! We're clear, damn it! Get out of here! Look who's here. -No! -Stan! Stan, stop! Arnold has another idea! Subtitles: ECLAIR
