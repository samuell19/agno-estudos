CHA Seung-won. No, he's a traffic accident victim SONG Yoon-ah. But he had your card and picture in his wallet... I thought you might want to see him. RYU Seung-ryong. Written and Directed by YOON Jae-go. When I kill... I look into the eyes of the person for the last time that way I can finish the job quickly without pain... a clean death... Do you know me? But, I can never forget their eyes the way they look back at me. Will they ever forgive me? I think you'd better ask a priest about that. You gotta listen to me carefully. Detective Kim... Homicide, Jungbu Precinct... 31 years old... Only child died a year ago... now lives with his wife... in Seoul... Kangnam... - Who are you? - Il-won dong... - I said who the hell...? - Please, step aside. Tell me, goddamn it! Detective Kim... my last hit was... SECRET Is that a new lip stick? It's pink-violet, the color of the season. You look nice today. And, those earrings... aren't they your favorite? I smell something fishy. I want to look my best today. For who? For who? Let's start over... Shall we? I'll pay you back... Just give some more time. Are you listening to what I'm saying, punkass? What you can do now is to answer yes or no! What I can do is to kill you or let you live depending on your answer. Got it? - Yes! - Good! That wasn't difficult, was it? Let's start again... Your mother's shop... It's not worth much anyway, right? It can't be more important than her son's life, can it? Besides, if you lose one of your fingers... Think about how much it would break her heart? Right? Damn it! Let's get this done and over with. You'll bring me the deed tomorrow? I'll... kill you fucking bastard! Choi! Long time! Welcome back, man! I haven't had this shitty canteen food in a while. It's not bad... It's been 2 years. 2 years and 3 months, to be precise... thanks to you. Congratulation on returning. Don't bother. Let me know if there are any fucked-up cases. I'm gathering all the fucked-up shits. You shouldn't have pulled the trigger. He had raped two women and killed one man! It was personal. One of the victims was your colleague. I was suspended thanks to your testimony. For 2 years and 3 months! I'm sorry about that. But, we should press on with the plan. I'm going away for a while... for some air. I thought I'd see you before I leave. How's Ji-yeon? She's getting better. So, I mustn't strain her any more. That's touching. But, what about me? The way you treat her disgusts me. All that fuss over a death of a child? Don't talk about her like that! Then, maybe I should tell her the truth. I'll tell her myself. You had a whole year to do that but you never did. Why don't I do the honor? I'm kidding... But, every time I see your face it makes me want to tell her. Especially today. Guess who I'm meeting today? You always leave right after. You know how much I hate it when you do that? I told you not to call. You say that all the time! Scared that the kid might hear me? All right... whatever. I gotta go. I'll call you later. Hello? Hello? - Hello? - Daddy. Su-hyun! Su-hyun! Did you drink? And, drove with your kid in the car? Are you crazy? YOO Ji-yeon Where have you been? Didn't you get my calls? - What happened? - Nothing. You look so pale. Where's one of your earrings? I must have dropped it somewhere. Do you want to talk about it? Tomorrow. Hello? Where's the forensics? Late as always... Caught in traffic? Every time you're on the road! You have film in the camera? - You don't need one. - CSI, my ass! They are always the first to arrive at the scene. Get your asses over here now! Is that violet? What kind of lip color is it? Pink-violet. It's the color of the season. I didn't know you were into that kind of stuff. My wife wore it this morning. Then we should question her first. There is a witness who saw a young woman. - Go ahead, bring her in. - Okay! You look awkward in anything you wear! Don't touch anything! Just with your eyes, okay? The forensics will give you a hell. Jesus! Man, you scared me! That's okay. I'll do it. Hey, come over here. I smell something. Go ahead, sir. I'll pick up the rest by myself. Hey, I said come here. What are you doing, man? Go ahead, sir. Hello? What's wrong with him? Uh... no... Hey, you owe me a drink. Look, it's dope! - Are you all right? - I'm not feeling so well. You're weird today. Sir, I brought the man who saw a young woman. Super! We have a customer. Let's see what he has to offer. Name and age? Kyung-ho... Park Kyung-ho... I'm twenty-seven. Let me handle this. Take care of outside, will you? Don't worry. I won't touch a hair on him. Occupation? Never mind. It's obvious... Don't get hot-headed again. Will you stop bringing up the past? The forensics is here. Hey, look who's back? Can you get here any later? Hey, did you see the new equipments? They're same as the shits the CSI uses. You saw a woman walking out of here? Yeah... She was really weird wearing violet lip color. Can you recognize her if you see her again? Totally! She was... really hot. I can never forget a pretty face. It's true! I can... I can really remember her clearly! You, punk! Are you on drugs? - No, not anymore! - Don't lie to me, punkass! When was the last time you used it? A month... a week ago. But, I'll never touch it again. Did you tell any of the cops about what you saw? Yes... No! Not in detail. Listen to me carefully! This is an incredibly important case and we're doing a secret investigation. If you tell anyone about what you saw, you're going to jail. You understand? Answer me, punk! Call me if anything happens and leave the town for few days. Remember... If you interfere with a secret investigation. You go straight to jail, got that? Yes, sir! I'll remember that! A secret investigation. Hey, go home if you're not feeling well. Don't stick around like a sick dog. Why? So that you can freely beat up witnesses? What? Is it exciting to be at a crime scene again? Yeah. But I decided to refrain myself cuz you'll rat me out again. Of course, you should. What are you gonna go? You can cut the crap. Hey, how did it feel gunning down a man? - You bastard! - Did it give you a hard-on? Stop it, guys! Come on! What's the matter with you, man? Do you know a man called Cho Dong-cheol? He was found dead in his apartment tonight. Do you know him? Can we talk about it tomorrow? I'm really tired. Where did you lose your earring? I don't know. I've been to different places. You must have an idea though. At the practice hall. That's right... that's where. - Was anyone with you there? - No, I was by myself. - By when did you stay? - Till ten o'clock. - What did you do there? - I just thought about things. And, then? What did you do next? Please, stop it! Stop! But, I must know. As a detective or as a husband? - As your husband. - Then, you have no rights. I'll go over some key facts of this case. Estimated time of death is between 9 and 10 pm on November 13th. That's when the death rigor set in. The victim was stabbed three times by a sharp object the fatal blow was the second one which penetrated the heart. Stop with the counting! Who's been KO-ed, huh? One man is dead and we're after the killer. Simple as that! And, don't talk with your mouth full of pizza. It really turns off my appetite. I did a thorough preparation for the briefing. Write up a report. I'll give you a good grade. Did you get anything from the witness? You know, the druggie who saw a young woman... He talked rubbish. He doesn't know what he saw. He's a junkie. Didn't I tell you no eating during a meeting? - Open up the windows! - Yes, sir! - Pizza? - Give him a piece. You pathetic bunch! This case got a little complicated. The victim turned out to be Cho Gwang-cheol's brother. Pardon? Who's that? Maybe you know him by his nickname. Jackal... Of the Seven Stars Gang. Whoever did this got himself into a big trouble. Hitting Jackal's brother. I hope you find the killer soon. He's good as dead. He just doesn't know yet how painful his death will be. Don't worry about it. We'll catch the killer. Actually, I would appreciate it. If you get your hands off this case. Even if you catch the killer, there'll be complications like trials and sentencing... you know... the procedures. We have our own rules. I'll take care of it my way. And, I'll probably find him before you do. I don't know who it was... but I'll skin him alive until he begs me to kill him. That's the rule. So, I'll ask you... If you ever... EVER! Get to him before we do just ignore him. You can't catch him before I do. Do me that favor. You have any other favor? Other than a stupid one? You wanna bet who catches him first? Can't you be faster? We might have to leave as soon as tomorrow. It's not a fucking hamburger... Why didn't you have the passports renewed earlier? Come on man. It's really urgent! Speed up if you can. I told you it takes a few days! Once expired, passports are no more than a toilet paper. Shall we take a break? He wants to go and see his mother for her birthday tomorrow. Kids like that have bigger hearts... But, what can we do? What's done is done. You're sure he was with the victim on the day of murder? He got beat up pretty bad by the victim. The punk went around drunk telling everyone he would kill the victim. Okay, let's get rolling. And, you! Don't you touch a hair on him or I'll have you leave for good. Don't worry about it. I'm not an idiot. How could I, with Kim breathing down my neck? Let's do this the old way. Good cop, bad cop. Where were you between 9 and 10 last night? At a club. - With who? - By myself. You mean, you have no alibi? Depending on how you see it. What are you sneering at? Do I have something on my face? Aren't you the cop that shot the suspect in the kidnap case? You have a good memory remembering all kinds of shits. I saw you on TV. I thought you were pretty cool. It was you that the victim saw last before he got murdered. I did meet him but, that's all. Too bad! You have no alibi and, you went around telling people you would kill him. I did it out of rage just as you shot the man out of rage. What, bastard?! The woman he killed was your girlfriend, right? You should be thanking that cop over there. I ratted him out. I testified that it wasn't self-defense. Their questioning is always dramatic. A clear structure with a twist at the end. Did you buy a present for her? I don't do that stuff although I have something picked out. Which is...? If I tell you, will you let me go? I always wondered... Is Detective Choi really mad or is he acting? Don't you worry about that. Just stop playing poker before you lose your entire salary, got that? Have you ever hit a man before? Pardon? Have you ever hit someone and felt great about it? No. How did it make you feel after you got beaten up by Cho? It felt terrible. So much that you could kill him? Did you ever hit him before? - No. - Ever? - No, Never. - What about cursing? It's not a crime. You know that. I've never hit him or cursed at him or ratted him out like you. Let's stop. He says he hasn't done any of that. And you! Have you ever laid a finger on him? - Not once. - Did you hear that? He's never laid a finger on the victim. - Just one more thing. - What! You owe the dead man some money. How much? What's that got to do with this? Just answer my question unless you're hiding something from me. 30 grand. 30 grand? I should have borrowed some money from him. How's it possible to borrow money from someone who's about to die? Mister, can I just go? I need to get my mom a birthday cake. How'd it go? Give me one week. I'll get a confession out of him. - And, you? - I'm not entirely convinced. I smell something but it's not enough. There's something more to this. Something more? Are you sure he's our killer? Yes, I am. Without a doubt. What happened to the CCTV footage from the victim's apartment? It's a bitjumbled up. But, we'll have it before the end of the day. Jackal's sniffing around like a wild dog. We don't want him to find our killer first and shred him into pieces. Yes, sir! We can't hear you, girls! Yes, sir! You met Cho, didn't you? What the hell did you do with him? You wanna know? I can't help you unless you tell me everything. We found your earring at the crime scene and a wine glass with your lipstick. So, you want to know about it? Cho's brother has gone crazy swearing he'll find the killer himself. I must know exactly what happened in order to help you every detail about who you met and what you did. Is that what you want? What I did yesterday and who I met? What I want to know is how my little girl died and what you were doing that day! That's what I want to know! Ji-yeon. Ji-yeon, please! Let's talk about this. How's that going to change anything? Don't wear those earrings! Or the lip color. You gotta get rid of the clothes you wore yesterday, too! You're not as so smart after all. You've got the wrong man. We have the evidence, witnesses and the statements. At this moment, he is our prime suspect. Both you and I know that he's not the man. What makes you so sure? Ever stabbed a man before? Well... Thrusting a knife into a body isn't as simple as pulling a trigger. The stabber and the stabbed are one body just like sex. Look! My brother had he back toward the killer when he received the first blow. My brother fell to the ground but he wasn't dead yet. While he was still alive and kicking the killer stabbed him in his heart. Did you see it happen? You talk as if you were there. I've done it my share of times. Concentrate! I'll explain it again. It's the splatter from the first stab he received while standing up. It's round and has smooth edges. The shorter the distance the smoother its edge will be. People like us can tell about the stabber just by looking at the blood drops. Whoever gave the first stab was not a professional. He didn't manage to give a fatal stab on the first attempt. An indecisive weak bastard who has never used a knife in his life. Byun Seok-jun has been in jail three times. A man like that lives by his knife. He can't have given him this blow. Detective, this is our area of expertise. The killer is a non-professional. Take my word for it and don't waste any more time. I've always want to ask you. What is it that you're chewing? Kopi Luwak. The cats excrete the seed after digesting the coffee beans. Indigenous dry their excrement to get Kopi Luwak. Would you like one? I'll pass. And next time, don't come in here unless you're summoned... so, I'm not confused. The first blood drop fell from about 5 ft roughly where Cho's heart would be. And the second ones were splattered from jugular vein. That was after he fell on the ground. Exactly as Jackal said. Would you say the killer was a man who's not familiar with knives? I couldn't tell. We don't know for sure if it was a male. It could have been a woman. I agree. I cannot tell conclusively if the killer was a male or a female. Over there! Oh my... You're okay cutting up dead bodies and you're scared of cockroaches? Please! Get rid of it, Now! You're screwed up. No, not there. Dump it in the bin. It's the bad feng-shui. Hey, you're pretty and you've got a nice body. So, go on dates in the weekends instead of spending all your time here. You're not eating? Why do you always wait 3 minutes? And... you did it on purpose, didn't you? What? The wine glass... you know, with pink-violet stain. You pushed around my nerves to break the glass, right? What are you accusing me of? Fine, if it wasn't the case. Eat up. I'm eating... The same shit that you're eating, asshole! You found it? In the storage room? Okay! Good job. It's game over. They found the footage. - You can't go in there. - That's all right. I can. No-one is allowed without a clearance. What's the matter with you? - Detective Kim! - Hey! What's up? What brings you here? I have something to check. Why don't you come in? - This guy's being a pain. - Step aside, proby! - But, he can't. - What! They're running a strict policy. It'll loosen up in a few days and, I'm considering applying for homicide. Really? We'll soon be working together, then. I'll look forward to it so much. Sure. Thanks, man. Detective Kim! Detective Kim? Detective Kim. Here you are. Are you in charge of Cho case? Yeah... I think I saw a button at the scene. I couldn't get it out of my head. There was no button. There was some kind of a tape though. You mean the CCTV footage? It's not here. Detective Choi took it with him earlier. Sir. Where have you been? We've been waiting for you. Sorry I'm late. Take a seat. Start the tape. Yes. The person on this footage is most likely to be our killer, right? Most likely? He is the killer. - Isn't that right? - Sure. Press play. We're waiting. It's the button in the middle, with an arrow. Do security check of all in the footage. Absolutely. From here is the time of crime. What the hell? - What's going on? - I think it's deleted. What's wrong with you? I've not been feeling too well. That's what I feel when you guys give me troubles and, make up with Choi. Have a drink or a fight. Stop acting like sulky chicks. It looks like we'll settle it soon. Hello, little fella! We used to come here a lot with Su-hyun, remember? Is that why you wanted to see me? Things are not looking good I told you about Cho's brother. I don't know what he's up to. Let's steer clear of him anyhow. I'll take care of the visa. You really think I killed that man? That's not important. What's important is that you leave safely for America. So, I flee to America... Will that make me happy? Will that sort out everything? What's important is you and me and our dead daughter! Ji-yeon, please... Hello? No, I'm on my way. I'll be there soon. Hello! Hello! Hello! Welcome to Everland! Would you like to buy a chocolate! - How much is it? - A dollar. Please buy one more. If you buy two, you get a bonus. Here. You bought two, so I'll give you a bonus. That's okay. I'll take it next time. I've got to go. I'm late for practice. Go to America with me. Let's start over, there. You gotta give me another chance. We can have a child again. Did you like the bonus? Who is this? You bought two chocolates from me. By the way, your wife so hot! Slender women have tiny breasts but your wife has big titties. What's it feel like touching them? Does it give you a hard-on? Women with big titties like that make killer moans, don't they? Of course... Hey, do you have any more chocolates? I don't know... I think you're all right I was going to hang up if you didn't answer. You do it at least 3 times a week, right? That's the minimum. You're the man. Don't hang up! But, I prefer soft touch to rough. What do you like better? I like both. What do you think you're doing? I'm sorry. Are you mad at me? Don't be... I'll give you another bonus after I hang up. I might send one to Mr. Jackal as well. He bought two chocolates for me. Why don't I send one to the Homicide, too while I'm at it? Hey. I can't just take from you. Is there anything I can do for you? More than that, it's getting... What? ...more and more interesting. - It's a woman. - Freeze it there! We can't see the face. Can you restore it? I won't know for sure but, I'll what I can do for tomorrow morning. It's getting more and more interesting. And, there's a witness who saw a woman. Isn't that right, Kim? That's right. I didn't pay much attention because he was a junkie. Get the witness' ID. Yes, sir. - You knew all along... - What... ...that I wasn't the killer. Walk it off, man. You know how it works here. I'm pissed off because I know how the cops make a criminal out of an innocent man. You locked me up on purpose, bastard! Man... the little bastard has a temper. The only way to deal with them is a good smack. Here. You know what, though? I actually agree with the punkass. What do you mean? That you locked him up on purpose. What are you talking about, man? I'll be on the move soon. Who knows? I may be able to pay you back. You were half right and half wrong. It wasn't a professional but an ordinary woman. Yeah... Give it to me, baby. The woman's face was blurred on purpose. It means an eye witness exists. More... Kim is hiding something. If the killer is a woman, she could be connected to him. Yeah... that's really good. Keep going... Kim got the witness to go into hiding. She is someone that he has to go so far out to protect. A bit more! Kim's wife is going to America in five days. It's the safest place. He also got the witness to go into hiding. All right! His wife's last concert is on tonight. Find that witness and bring him to me! Where are you now? Someone's following me. I told you to leave the town. I came here to catch the train but, they followed me here. Who? They're coming towards me. What do I do? I can't believe this is the last concert. Step aside! What... Yes, boss. This way, come on! Sis! Why did you run so fast? I only wanted to her face. Hey, the woman you saw at the apartment, is she here? She is. The pretty lady... Show me who that is. It's her! The pretty lady! Sober up, crack head! The woman you saw. Wasn't it her? No... It was this lady, here. Are you going up or what? I did good, didn't I? Secret investigation. You didn't kill Cho, did you? Did you? Just tell me you didn't kill him! Please! - Calm down. - Right, huh? You've been framed. You've been framed and I just have to save you, right? Please, calm yourself down. Just tell me you didn't do it! I did not kill Cho Dong-cheol. Then, where were you between 9 and 10 pm on that day? I can't tell you. You have to tell me! If you didn't kill him, you gotta tell me what you did and why you met Cho. - You really want to know? - Yes... Please... It could change your life forever. - You still want to know? - Yes, I do! I'm sorry it came out all blurry. That's okay... Hey, can I buy some more chocolates? I knew you'd want more. Once you taste it, there's no going back. If I buy more chocolates, will I get bonuses, too? Of course! I'll send you a clean version this time. Great! Can I buy the whole batch? Can I ask you another question? Do you go in the shower with her, too? That's a given between married couples. I see... How much are the chocolates? Your wife is really my type. Who has bouncy tits and narrow waist. Can I do her? Just once? I'm kidding... If I do, she'll keep begging for more. Just tell me how much! You know chocolates are expensive. 300 thousand. 8 P.M. tomorrow at the parking alley. Don't be late. Hey, man. Don't drink on an empty stomach. Get something to eat. You never disappoint me. You always show up when I call. It's hard, isn't it? They say you bury your child in your heart. There is nothing hard about it... I just... can't forget her eyes. Ji-yeon came running from the other side of the corridor and her eyes met with mine and, I knew... I knew then... that, with Su-hyun gone, it was over between us. There is no need to look, man. - Let's grab something to eat. - But, they're real. I'll give you 30 bucks get yourself some cigarettes. I'm telling you, these are real diamonds! Take them somewhere else! All right... Give me my 30 bucks. Only because I know you, man. Who the f... Hey, how've you been, man? - She's pretty. - How long will it take? A couple of months? Or a week, if I worked hard. Tonight. I'll pick it up later. No way! Making fake passport and visa is no child's play. Hey, I mean... Of course you can do it for tonight. How much would you bet on 'not'? I wouldn't. - Any progress? - Not bad. I think I can get the face finished in an hour. - I think she'll be pretty. - I suppose... You're not playing poker, anymore? I quit doing it for a while now why won't anyone believe me? You quit gambling and I'll quit smoking, man. Thanks for the other day. I was in real trouble with loans and credit card bills... You know I'm expecting a double interest. Come on, man. - Are you all right? - I'm okay. I spilt some on my trousers. You gotta be careful, man. There's some tissue. Clean up. So careless... I'm a little off today. You're okay, though... right? Yeah. Keep on with the good job. See you later. I had some high expectations of you. That's why I paid off your debts. I'm very grateful for that. But, I'm a bit pissed off with you. I'm not happy with your progress. You said you'll get the footage ready for this morning. There's been a problem. I'll get it ready for you by tomorrow. Crime follows around money. They're close friends. You can't possibly separate the two. Sir... I know for sure that Kim and his wife are somehow related to this case. I don't understand how difficult it can be tracking the phone and bank records. I'm a little hesitant about going behind a colleague... You know what money was used to pay off your debts? If it's exposed, you're finished as a cop! Now, make your choice! Stick up for a sad brotherhood or lose all! Choose! I'll do as you say, sir. Bring me everything you have on Kim and his wife by tomorrow! And get your stinky ass out of here now! Why is it that you cops all stink like shit? What's the matter? Didn't I tell you to leave town? - I need some money. - What money? You're on drugs again, aren't you? It's not like that... I'll wire some into your account. Stay in your house. You'll really give me money? Listen carefully! For this one time only, all right? And, you won't set a foot outside until next week. Is that clear? Yes, sir... Stay home till next week... Do you give your wife good morning kiss? No. Don't be shy. You're married, so that's okay. All married couples do that. You're so innocent. - Are you listening to me? - Of course. Did you bring the chocolates? Sure! Look in the other direction. You can shoot me. But, you gotta give me the tape. I can give you more money. I can't do it. Some guy in a clown costume told me you'll show up if I waited here. I'm sorry. You didn't see his face at all? No. He was wearing a thick make-up. Did you celebrate your mom's birthday? What would you do if I were the real killer? What? You made the wrong first move and now, everything is messed up. Explain to me. I mean you and I are the same because we both made the wrong first steps... Hey, this is a really important problem for you, all right? Hey, it's not what you promised. What are you talking about? It was 30,000 in the bag. I never said 30K of 10 dollar bills. I meant 30K of 1 dollar bills. Maybe I should send the chocolate to Mr. Jackal. You, bastard! I'm kidding! But, you gotta get 30 of 1 dollar bills by tomorrow, okay? I don't understand what you're getting at. Right? Maybe I put it too difficult. Let me try again. You killed Cho and Kim is covering up for you. How's that? You came here to tell me that? We've been friends since Academy and he still got me suspended. Do you know what he's been up to? He's covering up tracks of the killer instead of trying to catch him. He's hiding evidences, pointing at the wrong person for the murder. Please leave. If a slow-brain like me has figured it out this is the end for him. He'll get an axe. And, there are tons of people out there waiting for him to leave the force. Please, go! Cops are really good at fighting in movies It's all bullshit, isn't it? What happens to the cop at the end in the movie you saw? It depends where there is a twist or not. How about the ones with a twist? The good cop wins but the girl leaves him. It's same as losing. And, you know the atmosphere is bad at the moment. What do you mean? Dope supply is dried up. Everyone's gone crazy getting their hands on it. Going price is what you name it. Good job, man. And, lend me that movie that you were talking about. Get your own copy. Yes... He just left. He'll be stopped at the immigration desk. They're not going anywhere until this is all sorted out. Anyways, what brings you here? I thought I would get some pocket money from gangsters. - How much? - Say... about 30 grand? More if you can afford it. It depends on what you have to offer. On second thought... You can't be greedy with dirty money. It'll lead to trouble. Come on, man! You're the complete opposite of Kim yet, you have the same eyes. You can't live long with that kind of eyes. Why are you really here? I think Kim and his wife are related, too. And? Same as you, I don't like him much. I also have a debt to settle. So what? Let's be friends, until we get him. Like I said, you're funny. - And... - And? What the real reason? Other than the crap excuse about brother's revenge. Give this to Ji-yeon. It's a five o'clock flight the day after tomorrow. I'll get going then. Do you want to come in? I would like to. I would really like to but I still have things to do. You're off this case. 30 grand has been wired to Cho from your wife's account. Why on earth did she give money to him? There is no correlation between her giving him money and him dying. On the contrary... The money your wife gave to Cho was transferred to a man named Koo. Are you familiar with the name? Are you questioning me? I'm keeping all possibilities open. By tracking my wife's account? Don't overreact! Your wife had some kind of a deal with Cho. And, the money she paid is the proof. - What deal? - I don't know. Drugs or something else that a housewife of her age wants. - Fucking bastard! - Stop! Why are you acting this way? What is it that you want to say to me? All circumstances point towards your wife as the killer. - You got proof? - Proof? There was no proof in my case, either. Just your testimony. Is that what this is about? At first, yes but not anymore. You, your wife and even Jacka are all hiding something. The funny thing is that even all of you don't know the whole truth. You each have a piece of a puzzle are holding it to yourselves. I want to put the pieces together. There's no such thing as pieces of a puzzle. One man is dead and one woman is in danger. And, that woman is my wife. Where are you going? I found a finger print on the victim's body. A finger print? You said you didn't find anything. We don't usually check for prints there. But I did, just in case... Just this once, out of curiosity. I understand. You used to be normal before you came here. I thought there would be a part of the body. Which might have been touched right before he died. When you go to men's room you could hold it like this leaving a print. And? I found a print that doesn't belong to Cho. You mean the woman who the print belongs to was with him right before he died. It wasn't a woman though. Maybe Cho was driving on the other side. - Who was it? - It belongs to Byun Seok-jun. Hey! Hey! You brought the cake to my mom, didn't you? Thank you. Who did this to you? There is a treasure chest over there. You'll find my mom's present and the second clue you're after. What are you talking about? Then, what is the first clue to this wretched game? Hang in there, man. You gotta know the first clue to save your wife, won't you? What? The first clue is you, detective. Someone hired a hitman to kill you. Hey! I gotta put the price up for the chocolates. What is it that you want? You need to go to your wife now. Before Mr. Jackal gets to her. What? I sent him the footage and he went berserk. Your wife is in hospital. She overdosed on sleeping pills. It's lucky she was discovered right away. We had her stomach pumped. She just needs a few days' rest. What happened to her? She's in a bit of a complicated situation so we need to move her. I need to arrest her, mother. What are you talking about? She will be safest there. - Detective Oh, - Yes. ...arrest the suspect. - But, sir... - Do it now. What did I say? I told you your wife was related. You touch a hair on her. I'll kill you. I won't touch her hair. - I'll skin her. - You, fucking bastard! Don't say anything until I arrive. Okay, sweetheart? You've got to be strong and trust your husband. You know how hard he is trying to get you out. Can we pull over for some cigarettes? I'll make a proper introduction of myself. I didn't have the chance at the concert. I didn't kill your brother. You can tell a lot about a person by seeing how he reacts in three situations. When you don't have an umbrella when it started to rain, when you have lost your wallet in an unfamiliar place, and... and... What was the last one? I can't remember... Umbrella, wallet, umbrella, wallet... God damn it, what was the last one? When you are lost? When you get caught drink-and-driving? When you're betrayed by a trusted friend... When you mother passes away... When you are caught lying! When you are caught lying... That's it! I remember now... When you're caught telling a lie. Now, let's see how you react in this last situation? I did meet your brother on the night of the murder but he was alive when I left. I don't really care who killed my brother. In fact, I don't care if he's dead or not. I'm only interested in my package that he stole from me before he died. Oh my... Guess what? I found the second clue. Pardon? I found the package that Seok-jun stole from Cho after killing him. You found it? Man, you're good. I'm guessing this is what Jackal wants. It's exactly 10 kg of heroin that Cho stole from Jackal. Let's meet now! Where shall we meet? Well... you don't have any more chocolates to sell. Don't hang up yet! Hold on! I still have chocolates for you! You can eat up the rest by yourself, son of a bitch! Don't hang up! Don't hang up! Don't decide until you have seen it. I told your friend everything, motherfucker! A clown told me to give this to you. It's the last chocolate. Someone hired a hitman to kill you. He survived but he is paralyzed except in his right eyelid. There is no way I can communicate with him? He can barely blink. Blink once for 'yes' and twice for 'no'. Is your name "Koo Cheol-seung"? The woman that hired kill me, was it her? Was it this woman? You have a call, Detective. Your wife's been kidnapped by Jackal's men. In any case, you were the last person to see him before he died. Then, my package disappeared. Directly or indirectly, you are related to this case. I really don't know. You're the hard ass type that resists to the end. I have what you're looking for. There is a number on the package. Call it out. JMV47, Kopi Luwak is a throw-in. Your husband is a real funny man. Listen to me carefully. From now on is a real secret investigation. You can do this, right? Detective Choi, I'm about to join a real big round. No, it's really big and I need your help. Let her go, first. - Can you do me a favor? - What... Buckle up! We have two choices. One is... for me to pretend I know everything and get you to confirm the facts. That sounds like a good method. Nice and clean. The thing is I don't really know anything for sure unless you tell me. What's the other option? Now that our time is up we both tell the truth. That sounds good, too. Whichever one it'll be, I'll protect you. I went to a hotel with Hye-Jin on that day. I was drunk and I picked up our daughter from the nursery. And, the accident happened. That's how our baby died. She died because of me. Whatever you tell me, I'll understand. - Whatever it may be. - I wanted to kill you! Don't get off the car, no matter what. And, I think this looks best on your finger. Business is business. I gotta end it with you. Let's get on with it. I'm tired. You got enough bullets? Enough to kill you. We'll see about that. - Sir! - Return it to me after you're done. Back off, you bastards! Freeze, motherfucker! Put the knife down. Lose the gun first, son of a bitch! You too, motherfucker! That wasn't self-defense! Should I testify against him? Are you all right? Give it to Chief Kang, all right? It's all over now, isn't it? The secret investigation. Yeah... They've given you a sedative. Get some sleep now. I wanted to go on the trip with you. Let's go together when you've recovered. - What about Detective Choi? - He's in the next room. He is determined to testify against you. That bastard... There is someone who wants to see you. He worried about you a lot and waited here until the operation finished. You have something to say to him? Yes, ma'am. - Does it hurt a lot? - A little. That's a relief. Let's do a secret investigation together again. Sure... Let's do it again. And, there is another thing that I really want to do. What's that? I told you before I want to do your wife. I really wanted to hear her moan. When we were about to kill Cho and pick up the package your wife showed up Lucky for us. Is that...? You're sure she's the cop's wife? Yeah... but don't you think it's a bit risky? On the contrary. We'll get killed by Jackal if we get caught distributing his dope but if her husband is a cop, it's a different story. It's over. You can forget about it. She doesn't want the hit. Leave the cop alone. What kind of moronic hitman gets hit by a car while at a job? We need her ring or earring whatever that belongs to her so that we can frame her. I'll get something out somehow. You stay with Cho until I come back. Don't start without me, okay? - Go, punk! - Damn it! That greedy monkey hid the package to keep it to himself. You, moron! Didn't I tell you to wait? You've been telling everyone you'll kill Cho. Cops will track it down to you, moron! Then you tracked him down. That little fucker told me to get him out if I wanted to see the package again. You must get me out. - Don't you trust me? - Do you trust me? I didn't know what to do. I killed him but I didn't know where he hid it. Then, you found it for me. Bravo! Thanks to you the package came back to me, where it belongs. Remember, the secret investigation isn't over yet. There isn't much to see in Hong Kong, is there? It's the same with everything. Chicks are all the same once you strip them down to nothing. - You, son of a bitch! - How have you been? I told you I'd catch you! You didn't catch me. I came to you. Thanks for saving the trouble. Let's find a police station. Let go of this. People are looking at us. Detective, your wife is a murderer. What are you talking about? Cho was killed by you and Seok-jun. When did say that she killed Cho? She killed someone else. Let go of me. Your wife's coming this way. Who did she kill, then? You really don't know? Who she killed? The person that comes to your mind now. That's the one. Bingo! Call me if you need to see the proof. A bit expensive but we gotta continue with our secret investigation, right? I'm sorry it took a while, didn't it? Let's go. You knew about it. You knew all along and pretended you didn't? You'll forgive everything after he cheated on you with your friend? What are you, a saint? You think I'm not good enough to be your competition? I'll go if you don't have anything else to say. No! Stop right there! I'll tell you what you don't know. A real good story. Shall I tell you about how I seduced him? How about what we did in the hotel before the accident? Did you that your daughter knew about us? Oh, you didn't know that... I babysat her during your concerts. How can she have not known? She seemed to be troubled until the moment she died. What if mommy found out... Is there more that I don't know? Well... Shall I tell you what turns him on? Maybe I should hear it. May be I should.
