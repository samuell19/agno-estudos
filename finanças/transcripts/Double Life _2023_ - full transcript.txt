- Second round? - Yeah. Can I get a vodka soda for the road, Jo? Wendy, baby, I'm gonna pretend I didn't hear that. There you go. Thanks, darling. Wendy. Two more beers. I think I can manage that. What are you doing after work? Hmm. You already know. Wow. Is that the time? Are you serious? As the trial nears for Richard Dellicano, the embattled CEO of Dellicano Industries. Assistant District Attorney Mark Setter remains emphatic... You're unbelievable. ...what's happening to the region's groundwater. We will prove the company acted in a shocking display of bad faith and showed no concern for the lives of local residents. Thank you. As District Attorney, I will be personally overseeing this case. Mark has my full confidence. Sure I do, Sheldon. And in other news... Oh, really? Do you have to go? Yeah. I gotta get back to the office. No rest for the wicked. Go ahead, you can admit it now. What am I admitting? That you're impressed by the whole Dellicano thing. Just a teeny bit. I like the tie. You gave it to me. Did I? That's impressive. I'll call you. Mark... Yeah? I saw you with Ernie Dux. It's none of my business, but be careful. I've heard stories. You're sweet. But you don't need to worry about me. I'm a big boy. Not that big. Oh... hey, now. Call Sharon. Mm. Hey, hon. Hey. Did I wake you? No, no, no. I just laid down. You looked pretty hot on TV tonight. I don't know about that pink tie though. Oh really, you don't think it was a bold fashion choice? It was a choice. You on your way home now? Yeah. Finally. Sorry it took me so long. Witness prep up with Larry. You know how it is. What the hell? What? Somebody's tailgating me. Well, just pull over and let them go past. Jesus! Mark? Goddammit. No, no, no, no, no, no! Mark? What... This is the voicemail of Mark Setter. Please leave me a message. 911. What's your emergency? Mrs. Setter? I'm Detective Traxler, King County PD. Where's Mark? I'm sorry. He's gone. I'm so sorry. No. He was involved in an accident. I need to see him. Can I see him? Yes. Actually, uh, we need to ask you to help us identify your husband. There was a pretty bad fire. God. We can get someone to watch the baby. There's... there's no baby. I'm so sorry you had to see him like that. I needed to, Detective. Carmen. You can call me Carmen. It wasn't an accident, Carmen. Oh, that's becoming more and more clear. Mark was a great lawyer. He was going to put some very powerful people behind bars. You knew Mark? I was involved in the Dellicano case. There's no one I would've rather trusted it to than him. Just know this isn't over. I'm not going to stop until I bring his killers to justice. Jo! Jo! Damn thing's useless. Buttons always get stuck. Well, the nurses tell me that may have something to do with the fact that you keep throwing it at the TV. Okay, let's try it. Police have... Here you go. ...of the driver who was killed last night in what was first... Wait a minute, go back. Huh? ...fiery accident, but is now being investigated as a homicide. Mark Setter was an Assistant District Attorney who was currently working on the state's high-profile case... What is it? What's wrong? ...Setter is survived by his wife, Sharon... Wife? ...Now, Mrs. Setter requests in lieu of flowers, donations be made to one of her husband's favorite local charities. Meanwhile, budget cuts in the mayor's office are putting a pause on... I want you to call us if you need anything. Anything. Mark was more than just a colleague, he was family. Family. And that makes you family too. Yes, it does. Our door's always open for you, sweetheart. Well thank you, Sheldon, Lisa. Of course, dear. I'm going to be texting you a lot. Fair warning. Give me a call when you get a chance - this afternoon. - Yeah, of course, sir. I've got some, uh, housekeeping to do at the office. Wheels of justice grind on. Well, Mark would've hated this, missing the football game for this nonsense. It was a beautiful ceremony, Sharon. I don't know how you pulled it all together. I appreciate that, Larry. Yeah, of course. And I know you're probably sick of hearing it but if you need anything, you don't hesitate. I know. And I don't mean that in a, "I'll be texting you," sort of way. Whatever you need, I'm here for you. Thank you. Give me a call sometime, soon, let me know you're okay? Okay. Shit. Mr. Strand. You didn't have to kill Mark. You don't have to kill me. I'm sorry, have we met? No, no, no... Then why are you making these accusations? It's presumptuous. Seems to me that you're already aware that whoever killed Mark Setter took something from him and is now trying to blackmail my employer. Dellicano, right? My employer has never been blackmailed before. He doesn't like it. Mark was my best friend. Well, all the better for the both of us that we find this killer... right away. Do you expect me to believe that Dellicano wasn't involved in Mark's murder? What I expect of you is to do whatever I ask. And what I'm asking you, Larry, where is it? I have no idea. Okay. So how about where did Mark get the materials in the first place? Listen... And if you lie to me... I'm gonna pay the widow a visit. Sharon? She's got nothing to do with this. Probably not. But I'm wondering if she can tell me... why you have a picture of her in your house. I've been watching you, Larry. You've got a thing for her. I thought Mark was your best pal. Look, leave her out of this. She's got nothing to do with anything. Please. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait, wait, wait... wait. Mark got it from this guy named Dux. Dux. What a stupid name. Like a duck? No, D-U-X. Ernie Dux. Is that the truth? Yeah. I swear, it's... it's the truth. Fuck. Hi. Hi. Did you know my husband? Yeah. Yeah, I did. I'm Sharon. Josephine. Jo. Were you at the funeral? Uh, this week's been a bit of a blur. No, no, I couldn't make it. I'm sorry. No, nothing to be sorry about. There were way too many people there. I've been coming here every day. I don't really know what I'm supposed to do though. Mark wasn't big on flowers, so... Did you know him well? Sort of, I guess. He helped me when my mother died. - I'm sorry. - She had dementia, and I thought that the facility she was in was negligent. Mark helped me with my options. Sounds like Mark. He was an idealist. Yeah. I should give you some privacy. No, uh... it's nice talking with someone who doesn't treat me like some broken woman. Do you visit your mom's grave? I have her ashes at home. Yeah, they asked me about that. I don't know. Just seemed kinda creepy to me. - Um... no offense. - No, no, no... uh... my mom bought her urn way before she died, before she was even sick, and it's freakin' butt-ugly. Yeah. My mom had pretty tacky taste, if I'm being honest. I mean, the crap she used to make me wear when I was younger, I looked like a doll in a horror flick. Do you feel like getting a drink? Or, I'm... maybe it's way too early for that. I'm on a kinda weird schedule these days. No, no, it's... it's not that. Actually, um... I know a bar that's not too far from here. And our drinks would be free. Okay. Great. Thank you. So, Mark used to hang out here? It's how we met. Hmm. Did he come here often? Yeah, sort of. The courthouse is really close, so we used to get a lot of that crowd. He never mentioned it. He had so many friends come to the funeral. People I had never met. It kinda made me feel like I was a bad wife, maybe we'd been drifting apart. I was too wrapped up in my own thing to even realize it. And I doubt it. Well, we both worked a lot. But... I don't know. The police wanna get into his work computer and his cell phone. I... I don't know the passcode or the password. I felt like the detective was secretly judging me. I mean, what do you think? Am I supposed to know that stuff? Why would you? Exactly what I thought. Was it Detective Traxler? Yeah. You know her? I went to see her. Mark had a meeting here with a couple of guys the night he died. One of them was a regular, Ernie Dux. Ernie handed Mark something and Mark paid him for it. What was it? I don't know. But I told Traxler just in case, um... just in case it might be related to Mark's death. You mean his murder. Yeah. Murder. Mark was working on the Dellicano case, probably the biggest of his career. Did you hear about it? Just bits and pieces on the news. They own coal mines. People started getting sick from the pits where they store the coal ash. That's the waste product that's left over, they bury it in the landfills. Something went wrong and people died. Mark was going after them for criminal negligence. Maybe that's what Ernie was helping him with. I haven't seen Ernie since the meeting, which is weird, he's usually here every day. What did Traxler say? Honestly, she just seemed overworked and distracted. Well, thank you for going to the police. I'm sure any information helps. Yeah, of course. It's the least I can do. Did Mark ever... Did Mark ever bring a woman here? - No. - You can tell me. I know I'm the grieving widow and all, but I can handle the truth. At least I'd like to think I can. I've never seen Mark in here with anyone other than work buddies. Why do you ask? It's probably nothing. It's just a few little things. I didn't even think twice about them at the time, but... now they kind of have me wondering. Like what? All of a sudden he started wearing a pink tie. I know that's not a big deal, but I've known Mark since college, and he has never worn pink, ever. I know it sounds stupid, right? No. Actually, it doesn't sound stupid at all. You think it might mean something? That's Wendy. Who's Wendy? Ernie Dux's girlfriend. She might know where he is. She was here that night. Hey, Wendy. How's it going? Hell, I don't know. I feel like crap. You back to smoking again? I got worse habits. What you drinking? Gin today. You know where Ernie's been? Speaking of bad habits... - What are you looking at? - She's with me. And... the drinks are on the house if you can tell us how to find Ernie. Sounds like easy money to me. This is Detective Carmen Traxler. Leave me a message. Hi Detective, this is Sharon Setter. Can you call my cell phone as soon as possible? I have some important information. Thank you. What if she doesn't get back to us tonight? Wendy could tell Ernie we're looking for him. He could get spooked and then just disappear. You're right. We need to go see him for ourselves. Yeah. I'll drive. My Jeep is around the corner. Now? Yeah, now. Thank you. Don't mention it. No, really. You don't have to do this. I really appreciate it. Well, Ernie might not even be there. Wendy's not the most reliable source, so let's not get our hopes up. Well, at this point it doesn't even matter. It just feels good to finally be doing something instead of waiting to see what happens next. So you, um, you met Mark in college? Yeah. Yeah, undergrad. He didn't know what he wanted to be. He was studying philosophy, I was an English lit major. You're a writer? Oh. Well, sort of. My plan was to be a novelist, but I got kind of sidetracked when I took a Japanese course and realized I have a knack for the language. A knack for Japanese? Damn, girl. So now I translate Japanese novels. My own writing has been put on hold for a long time. Well, translating novels sounds like writing to me. Ernie? It's Jo from the bar. You in there? Somebody broke the lock. Why don't you stay out here? What? You're just gonna go in? Like you said, it's better to do something. Sorry. I can't just stay outside. Okay. Ernie? Ernie, you in here? Ernie? It's Jo. The bartender you never tip. Oh, God. That's Ernie. Oh, God. Is he dead? Who was making that noise? Let's get outta here. Okay. There's more than one. Okay, I'm calling the police. Okay. Wait! What are you doing? We're not waiting for the police. Those guys are getting away. We need to see who they are. Go, go, go, go, go! Stay where you are! Put the gun down, Mrs. Setter! What? Come on. What are you doing? Oh, my God. Yeah. He was dead when we got there. Yeah, you said that. Well, the thing I wanna know is why did you two wanna go see someone like Ernie Dux? We needed to ask him some questions. I'm guessing he gave you the wrong answers. Thanks, Glen, I got it from here. Look at you... were you on a date? I said I got this, Glen. Get 'em to tell you how he was dead when they got there. They love saying that. Mrs. Setter, what the hell are you doing? We needed to talk to Ernie Dux about Mark. You could've been killed. He gave Mark something. Or... or sold him something. Whatever it was, it got Mark murdered. I tried to tell you this, Detective. Miss Creuzot... Look, now Ernie Dux has been murdered too. It has to be connected to what happened to Mark. Did you see the men who attacked you? Yeah. Pretty well. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. Thank you. Now more than ever, you need to be careful about making new friends. She's been in and out of state facilities. Did a stint in juvie. Most recently she got popped for fraud and assault. Well, she can fight. Thank God. If she's leading you into this... It was my idea. My husband, my idea. Then why is she helping you? Have you thought about that? Why are you more concerned about her than about Ernie Dux? Whoever killed him must've had something to do with Mark's death. We're looking into it. Well, she tracked him down, which is more than you guys have done. I'm sorry, that was a bit harsh. I'm sure you've had your hands full. How was it going? What? The date. No. No. No. Wa... Wait a minute. Go back one. That's him. Are you sure? I never forget a face I punched. That's him. That's Sonny Strand. Who? Was the other one older? Maybe looked like he could be this guy's dad? Yeah, might've been. Jesus Christ. You two tussled with Louis Strand. You know him? I wouldn't be surprised if he drinks at Mahoney's. I've never seen him there, but I've heard stories. What kind of stories? Usually the kind where people die. Uh, people with deep pockets hire Louis to make their problems go away. Sonny's a screw-up, but we've never caught Louis for anything. He is smart, extremely dangerous, and now you're both on his radar. Thanks again, Jo. For what? For saving my life back there. Even if you did go a little bit crazy. Where did you learn to fight like that? Ex-boyfriend, Jacob. This Israeli dude. I think he was Mossad or something, I don't know. He'd never say. Anyways, he taught me all the fun stuff like Krav Maga and shooting. Oh yeah, I noticed that. Yeah, well, obviously he didn't teach me well because I was definitely aiming for their heads. Well, you did enough to keep us alive. Anytime. I hope nothing like that ever happens again. Yeah, sure, me too. But... Yeah. Nice house. Mark was so proud when we got it. - Sharon... - Yeah? I need to tell you something. Oh, no. What? The door. Shit. Sharon! Sharon, wait! This is my house. My God. Hey... Hey, you really wanna sneak up on an intruder again? I need to see... You... you and Mark have a kid? Why would they do this? I guess we pissed them off. Andy only got six hours. Just enough time for one dream. We never even got to bring him home. He spent those six hours in a plastic box attached to tubes. He struggled, he tried, but... I fell apart. Slept most nights in here. Mark tried. He offered to bring a bed in here. I just couldn't say yes. 'Cause then it wouldn't be Andy's room anymore. Does that make sense? Sure it does. I'll be right back. Okay. I packed some of your stuff. You're gonna come stay with me. Come on. I called the cops. My vote is we get outta here before they turn up. I'll stay at a hotel. Yeah, sure. Come with me, let's go. Wow. You're an artist. Most of the time. Managing the bar keeps the lights on. Say hi to Mom. Oh, geez... Told you it was hideous. Sorry, Mama. Anyway... the good news from tonight is that your house is totally wrecked. - What? - Well... if it was only half wrecked, that would mean they found what they were looking for. Yeah, that's a good point. So we know they didn't find it. I just wish we knew what it was. Well, information? Evidence? Doesn't really matter. A file, a photograph. All that matters is they want it badly enough to kill for it. What is this? Some surveillance stuff that ex of mine left behind. It's tracking gear, listening devices, snoop tech. Thought he'd come back for it, but I should probably just get rid of it. Hm. Uh, yeah, I would put that down. - What is it? - It's a flashbang. You use it to blind and disorient without killing anyone. What is it doing just laying out here? Well, I'm not exactly childproof here. Am I the only one that's starving? I am kinda hungry. Yeah, it's 'cause we haven't eaten all day. Pizza? Yes. Amazing. Good. I know a good place. What do you like on it? Just get whatever you usually get. - I like everything. - Everything it is. Beautiful. Would you mind if I freshen up a bit? Yeah, yeah, go for it. There's clean towels in the cabinet. Sharon? Damn. Sharon? Sharon? Sharon, are you okay? Oh... Hey, this is Sharon. Leave a message. I can't believe he'd do something like that to you. It makes no sense. I feel so stupid. Sharon, you're kind, you're trusting. You're not stupid. You really didn't know? He never said anything to you? Never. He must've known I would've kicked his ass. I mean, I know I don't look like it, but I can hold my own in a fight. I'm sure you can. So, if anyone ever messes with you, you let me know, all right? You're sweet. You've always been sweet. Do you think there were other women? I mean, why wouldn't there be? If he was with her... Don't think about that. You've been through so much. You... you need a break. I really do. I'm gonna head home. Sharon. Get outta here. Sharon! Sharon! Get out of my house! I tried to tell you. Bullshit. I did. I tried, okay? And then things just kept happening. Please leave my house! Look, Sharon, I know you must hate me right now... You're right. I don't blame you. Why are you here? What do you want from me? I wanna tell you the truth. I have no reason to believe anything you could tell me. You are a liar. I didn't lie. I just didn't tell you everything. And yeah, I know how weak that sounds, but every time I tried to tell you, something happened. Yesterday, yesterday was insane! And what's even crazier is I started to feel like you were my friend. Stop. I didn't know he was married. I thought he just worked all the time. I found out the truth from the news after he died. Don't you dare come here and expect sympathy from me. I don't. That's not why I'm here. I... I want you to have the whole truth about what happened between me and Mark. Is there anything you wanna ask me? When did it start? Just a few months ago. How many times? Like a dozen or so. Where? My apartment. In the bed you wanted me to sleep in? Yeah. Well, and on the couch. Have you ever been hit by a broom? I'm just trying to be honest. You can go now. That's him. That's the other guy that was with Mark the night he met with Ernie Dux. Well, that's Larry. They weren't together that night. He was there. Just to be clear, the only reason we're doing this together is because Larry hasn't been completely honest with me. If you're there, he won't be able to deny it. Look... Mark had two lives. His real one with you and... whatever he had with me. I think between the two of us we can figure out what happened to him quicker than Traxler. I mean, look at everything that happened yesterday. When we almost got killed? Well, yeah, there was that. But if we're gonna do this, we need to understand each other. Whatever we find out goes straight to the police. - Yeah, of course. - If it gets dangerous or it gets too risky again, we both back off. And we are not friends. Oh, my God, Mrs. Setter? - Hi. - Hi. I need to see Larry. Is he free? Oh, no, I'm sorry. He's not here right now. Do you expect him soon? I think so. All right, we'll just wait for him in Mark's office. Of course, make yourselves comfortable. And listen, Sharon, I've been wanting to tell you I am so, so sorry about Mark. Thank you. It's just so sad. He was such a great guy. Well, he was banging this one behind my back. But yes, such a great guy. Does any of this stuff mean anything to you? No. I doubt there's gonna be a smoking gun buried in all this. Hmm. Passwords. Well, should I try cheater? I think it's a little on the nose. One dream. Nice. Oh, what a mess. What are we looking for? I don't know. Let's try... email? How about his browser history? We can see what he was looking at before he came in the bar that night. There's a video here. Who's that? Uh, it's Lisa Roberts. The D.A.'s wife. ...Harper Foundation humanitarian award to a generous philanthropist, who also happens to be a dear, personal friend of mine. Rebecca Dellicano. Dellicano's wife? Yeah. She seems pretty tight with the D.A.'s wife. She sure does. Thank you, Lisa... Sharon. How are you, sweetheart? I'm doing okay. Are you sure? I'm sorry I haven't called. I've been meaning to. It's okay. I know you're busy. Never too busy for family. Now I know that Lisa is dying to take you to lunch and catch up. That would be wonderful. Good. Give her a call. Better yet, I'll have her call you. You've got enough on your plate as it is, God knows. Hello. Hi. Sheldon Roberts, District Attorney. It is a pleasure to meet your acquaintance. Josephine Creuzot, bartender. And back at you, Sheldon. Hmm. Donna tells me you're looking for Larry. - Yes. - Oh, I'm expecting him back in the next few minutes. Is there anything I can do? The police have been in and out of here a bunch of times but if there's anything specific of Mark's that you need, maybe I can help. No. It's nothing, really. - Are you sure? - You know, it's kind of a private matter, Sheldon. I see. Well, if there's anything you need, I am a phone call or a text away. Believe me, anything. Thank you, Sheldon. All right. Expect that call from Lisa. Wonderful. Got any hand sanitizer? It's not just me, right? Dude is slimy. Yeah, let's get outta here. What about Larry? I'm gonna call and see where he is. Over here. Jesus Christ, Sharon. What are you doing here? We're here for you. What are you doing here? Mark was murdered the other night. We need to know everything. Okay. Come on. Come on. What were you and Mark doing with Ernie Dux? Who? Larry? Okay. Okay. Mark was buying information. What kind of information? A thumb drive, that's all. All this craziness over this tiny little thing. What was on the thumb drive? It was an encrypted text chain that Ernie Dux got from a computer at one of the Dellicano mine sites. It was conversations with executives discussing things like coal ash pits, faulty linings, leaks. Things they were aware of, but did nothing to fix. And the farther you scan down the text chain the worse it got. Worse how? There were jokes. Uh... bad off-color jokes. Jokes about people getting sick. If those texts were made public, it could bring down Dellicano's empire. We already know Dellicano had Mark killed. - I... I don't think so. - What do you mean? I think whoever killed Mark has the thumb drive and they're using it to blackmail Dellicano. Is it you? Seriously? You were with him that night. So were you. You... you took him home. In fact, you might've been the last person - to see Mark alive. - Okay, wait. You... you slept with Mark the night he died? He told me he was doing witness prep. I don't even know why I'm surprised by any of this at this point. It's so messed up, Sharon. I don't know why you're running around with her. You don't need this nonsense in your life. What about you, Larry? You told me you had no idea Mark was cheating. Just last night you swore, you said - you would've kicked his ass. - I didn't know what to say, Sharon. Mark put me in a terrible position. I'm so sorry. I'm out. You see what you've done? Just give her some space. How do I even get out of here? We just wanna talk, Mrs. Setter. Go! Get in! Again, thank you for saving my ass. I save yours, you save mine. We just have to keep it even like that. Can we walk? I am vibrating - after all of that. - Yeah. Why did they just show up like that? Yeah, how did they know we were gonna be there? Or were they even looking for us? You think they were looking for Larry? I don't know. He was pretty jumpy, nervous. So we're going to Traxler, aren't we? That's what you said. You said, "If this gets dangerous we're go to the cops." Well, that was dangerous. Traxler... What's up? I think I saw something earlier. See anyone who looks familiar? - Traxler. - Yeah. What's she doing rubbing elbows with this crowd? Well, that's what I'm wondering. Mark's on the verge of taking down Dellicano. Right before he's killed, he watches this video that obviously shows his boss's wife being quite chummy with Dellicano's wife. Which probably means the husbands are pretty tight as well. And the detective investigating his murder just happens to be at the same event? No way that's a coincidence. So who do we trust? I don't know. No one. Why is Louis Strand still coming after us? Does he think that we have the thumb drive? Maybe. Or maybe because we keep poking the bear. I mean, that must be making Dellicano nervous. Look, we've gotten away from Strand twice. Now, I don't think our luck is gonna hold for a third time. You wanna back off? Hell no. Good. 'Cause I want us to pay someone a visit. But first we're gonna have to go to your place. I think you have something that we could use. Use for what? To poke another bear. - Sharon! - Hi, Lisa. What a surprise. Is everything okay? Yeah. Could I come in? Of course. I'm sorry. Please, come in. - You said anytime, right? - Absolutely. Yeah. And this is Josephine Creuzot. Hi! Uh... hello. Jennifer, could you pour two more cups of tea, please? Sure. Please. Oh. This place is crazy. Um... thank you. You know, for a public servant, your husband seems to be doing pretty damn well for himself. Yes. Well, Sheldon has always been a very keen investor. So nice to see you, Sharon. How are you holding up? Yeah. I'm... staying busy. That helps. Are you and Sheldon close with the Dellicanos? The Dellicanos? No, not particularly. Thank you. - Why do you ask? - Well, we saw a video where you were calling Rebecca Dellicano your dear friend. Hmm. Mm-hmm. Well, we did do some charity work together but I guess that was a bit of hyperbole. That means exaggeration. So how do the two of you know each other? Through Mark. Poor Mark. What a world. Can I use your bathroom? Of course. I'll show you. No need. I have a good sense of direction. Well, those look tasty. They're divine. So, have you thought of doing some traveling? Traveling? You know, a little getaway. To help you get your mind off of... everything. I don't think a trip to Tahiti is gonna make me forget that my husband's dead. Of course not. That's not what I meant at all. Well, I missed lunch. So, how did you and Jo become friends? I wouldn't call us friends. Oh. Well, it's a funny story. So, the night Mark died, I thought that he was working late at the office, turns out, he was with her. He was "with" her? Mm-hmm. Yeah. Excuse me? They just fell and I was, uh, putting them back. I am so sorry. Sorry about that, sorry. Time to go, Sharon. Oh. I'm sorry. Thank you for your kind words, Lisa. You've been a big help. Uh, Miss Roberts... Thanks. I'll call Mr. Roberts. Sheldon... Sharon Setter was just here. No, I didn't invite her. It was the strangest thing. She just showed up outta the blue. She was with this trashy young woman. Yes. Josephine something. That's the one. Sheldon, she was in your office going through your files. I didn't let her. She snuck off. I was with Sharon trying to be polite. What was I supposed to do? I... I don't know. One is the Garrison case. And the other is... I don't know. I can't tell. Traxler. You need to tell me what's going on here. Why was Sharon asking me about the Dellicano charity? I'm not accusing you of anything. Of course, I trust you. But you need to start trusting me. Yes? Detective Traxler here to see you, ma'am. Tell her I'll be right there. Traxler's here. Why would she want to talk to me? Yes. Okay. I'll call you back. What do we do now? So what is it exactly that you're accusing Detective Traxler of? We're not accusing her of anything, we're just telling you what we know. She knew Mark. She knows the Dellicanos. She knows Sheldon Roberts. She seems to be in the middle of all this. Of course she is. Your husband is her case. Okay. You're not listening. Look, we showed you the charity event she was at. Mark was watching that video just before he died. And now you're trying to tell us that that doesn't mean anything? Wait here. Okay. Are we wasting our time here or what? I don't know. Should've known better than coming here. You two don't quit, do you? If we ever need junior detective recruits, I guess I know who to call. What were you doing at that event with Rebecca Dellicano and Lisa Roberts? A lot of us take cushy security gigs on the side. I guess you're not aware, but the pay around here sucks. So it was just a coincidence that you were at that particular event? I didn't say that. Then what were you doing there? It may have been related to an investigation. What investigation? I can't talk about that. Sure you can't. Recognize this? No, what is it? Sharon? I found it in Sheldon Roberts' home office. His wife, Lisa, was just showing me some files that you had been looking at, Jo. I guess I just missed you two. She must've been mistaken. I didn't do that. We just had a cup of tea. Is that true, Sharon? Yeah, we just had a cup of tea and some pastries. You guys know what a wobbler is? It's an offense that could be charged as a misdemeanor or a felony. Could go either way. Illicit wiretapping is a wobbler. Well, we won't be doing that then. Consider this your final warning. If either of you do anything like this again, I will arrest you both for interfering in a police investigation and whatever else I can think of. Are we clear? Yeah, we're clear. That went well. She's right. We're in way over our head. I just wanna go home. Don't you think we should stick together? Remember what I said about us not being friends? How could I forget? Fine, I'll take you home. Shoot, I forgot. What? We gotta make a stop. What is this place? Nursing home. - Who are we seeing here? - My mom. I thought she's in an urn at your place or was that just another lie? That's my adopted mom. She raised me. This is my birth mom. Hey, Mama. Oh, Jo. You said you'd be here more than an hour ago. I'm sorry, I was busy. The remote control's not working again. Let me fix it. Mom, this is Sharon. Hi. You Jo's friend? No Mama, we're not friends. Then why did you bring her here for? Long story. Mom, you haven't been eating? You know what I think of the food here. The food is fine. You have to eat in order to get better. Oh, don't talk to me about getting better. I'm gonna get you some new batteries. I'll be back. How do you know my Jo? She, um... She knew my husband. Knew? Is he no longer with us? That's right. I'd say I'm sorry, but what good would that do? Wouldn't do much good. I've lost enough people to know that. And most of 'em I do not miss. - Really? - Yeah. People are disappointing. Myself included. I'm sure that's not true. Just ask Jo. I gave her up as a baby. Didn't want kids. Can you guess what made me finally reach out to her after all these years? When you got sick. That's right. I didn't have anyone else to turn to. Not exactly proud of the fact, but it is what it is. That girl... didn't owe me anything. But she's been coming to see me every chance she gets. Hmm. Okay. Try this one, Mama. Well, look at that! It's a goddamn miracle. Mom's a lot. She really seems to depend on you. Lucky me. All right, let's get you home. Did he love you? No. I don't think so. I think I was just a bit of fun. Mark was in a high-pressure situation and I was just there. But you love him. What makes you say that? You've been risking your life to find out who killed him. Yeah. I loved Mark. I still do. It won't just go away. You know what? I never got to try that pizza you were bragging about. You sure you want everything? It includes a bunch of scorching fresh jalapeños. Bring it on. Okay. That's the spirit. Hey Tony, it's Jo. Can I get a delivery? - Hello? - Hello, Mrs. Setter. You need to keep your mouth shut and listen. This is for your ears only. Are you there, Mrs. Setter? Yeah, I'm listening. We haven't had the pleasure of being formally introduced yet. My name's Louis. You know who I am? Yes. I am sending you an address. You will meet me there immediately. - Why would I do that? - Glad you asked. Don't listen to him, Sharon! Larry? Larry, are you okay? Stay away from here! Do you understand me? Call the police! If you do not do as you're told, Larry is a dead man. If you call the police, Larry is a dead man. If you show up with anyone else, Larry is a dead man. Do you understand? Yeah... yes... yes, I understand. Just... just please don't... don't hurt him. Okay? Okay. I'm pouring wine. Do you want a little or a lot? Hey, what's going on? I gotta go. Okay, I'll go with you. Where to? No! What's wrong? Nothing's wrong. I just have to leave. What about the pizza? I don't want the pizza. I don't wanna be here. I can feel him here. I look at the couch. I can see him with you and... I just... I gotta get outta here. Okay. Okay, I get it. You don't even have your car here, let me give you a ride. I don't want a ride from you, okay? I don't want anything from you! Just stay away from me! You're alone? Come with me. No, no, no, no, no! Oh, my God, Sharon. You came. Larry, what is going on? What happened? I got this gun away from them. They were gonna kill both of us. And... and I got this. The thumb drive? This is why they killed Mark. They were gonna sell it to Sheldon. Wh... Sheldon Roberts? Why? 'Cause he was on the encrypted text thread with the Dellicano execs. He was gonna grease the wheels of justice for them. We gotta call the police. No. Wait, wait, wait. Sharon, Sheldon's on his way here with three million dollars in cash. Okay. We gotta get outta here. We gotta... we gotta leave. Wait, wait, wait, wait. Listen to me for just a minute. What if we handed the drive to Sheldon ourselves? And... and took the money ourselves. Larry... this is crazy. No, but Sharon, we could get away from all of this. Together. Larry... Well, look who it is. I should've known it was the two of you behind all of this. So where's your little friend, Sharon? No doubt hiding in here some place. Look, I am not involved in any of this. I just wanted to know who killed my husband. Yeah. Jesus Christ. What did you two do? Is that the money? Why did you kill them? What? Are you talking about your hired goons? I hired them to find the drive. I didn't authorize any violence. Little late to play innocent, Sheldon. Give me the drive. Give me the money! Give me the drive first? Open the bag! Okay. Put it on the ground. Sharon. Take the bag. Stop trying to make me a part of this, Larry, it's not gonna happen. Don't shoot him! What was he supposed to do? You guys were gonna kill him! Please tell her the truth, Larry? Huh? Tell her the truth! Okay. I will. You stay put, Counselor. You stay put. Mr. Roberts here, he hired me to find the drive. Turns out Larry had it all along. I underestimated him. Sharon, don't listen to him. Shut up! Larry and I, we made a deal today. To sell the drive to Mr. Roberts and split the money. You backstabbing bastard. You tricked me into coming here? No. Then he tried to get rid of Sonny and me when you got here. Play the hero. Pin it all on us. It almost worked, Larry. How did you get the drive, Larry? Sharon! You know me! I wouldn't do that. He killed Mark! Despite my reputation, I've never killed anyone. You killed Ernie Dux. I saw you there. Ernie Dux was already dead when we got there. He was just another loose end. Or maybe he helped you kill Mark. That's it. Isn't it? You killed... Mark? Sharon, Mark didn't deserve you! He never deserved you! He ran around on you, cheated on you. I would've taken care of you. It should've been me! Sharon, you... you... you came here, you risked your life to help me. I think... I think you love me as much as I always loved you. Jesus Christ. Have some dignity, Larry. I'm leaving. I can't let you do that, Mrs. Setter! I thought you didn't kill people. I'm walking away with this money. And if Sonny was walking away with me, I would happily turn my back on all of you. But Sonny's dead. And that means I'm gonna be tied to this mess no matter what. That means you're all loose ends. You haven't killed anybody yet. He killed my boy! What are you doing here? What do you think I'm doing here? Come on, I called Traxler. Larry killed Mark. I heard. Hopefully Traxler did too. Sharon, I got the money! Stay away from me! Sharon, please. - Stay away from me! - Shut up! Just give him the money, Larry. You're gonna get us all killed. He's gonna kill us anyways! Sharon, please. We can still get away from here together. - Sharon... - Shut up, Larry. Larry... Let's go. Okay, let's find a way out. Give me the money! Drop your weapon! Carmen, thank God. They were gonna kill me. Let me see those hands, Sheldon. Carmen... Hands behind your back. Louis Strand is unconscious on the ground back there. I'm impressed. Stay face down, Strand... I'll take that. And that. Please do. Thanks for the call. Junior detectives strike again. - How did you find me? - I tracked your phone. How? Another trick I learned from my ex. You know what I said back at your place, um... It's true, I don't think I can be there. But I shouldn't have. It's okay. You were protecting me. That's what "not friends" do. That's right. Got the thumb drive from Larry, thanks to you two. Piece of cake. I've been investigating Sheldon for a long time. I never trusted him, neither did Mark. I thought he might've been involved in Mark's death, but... It was Larry. His best friend. He confessed to it all. To killing Mark, stealing the drive, killing Ernie Dux to make sure he didn't talk. Says he wants to make sure you don't get blamed for anything. How considerate. The dude was obsessed with you. Certainly seems that way. I really don't like to admit this but, um... we might not have even suspected him if it hadn't been for you guys. Mark would be proud of you both. Dramatic new developments today in the case against Dellicano Industries. The jury was shown a series of texts that allegedly prove that Dellicano executives did, in fact, know that their landfill sites were severely contaminating local groundwater. And even more shocking, disgraced District Attorney Sheldon Roberts was on the chain as well, offering executives legal protection in what sounds like a blatant quid pro quo. Can you put a game show on, Jo? The news depresses the hell outta me. I couldn't agree with you more, Wendy. Mm-hmm. Me too. Mm. So? What? Is it amazing or is it amazing? It's the best ever. Worth the wait. Yeah, it is.
