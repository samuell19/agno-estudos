The skies will be generally cloudy with some morning fog. Leon and Castilla la Vieja will be overcast. For the rest of Spain, cloudy with some widespread showers and storms. Temperatures, remain constant. Two suspected criminals, classified as extremely dangerous, have escaped from jail in Barcelona, killing a youth and seriously wounding a policeman. A doctor from Orense has spent three days with an explosive device implanted in his chest. Bombings against Fuerza Nueva have taken place in Pamplona. Spanish fans are pessimistic about today's match against Brazil. Preferring to trust in Santa Rita, patron saint of the impossible, rather than in Kubala's plans. At the plenary session of Congress, a motion to the government to investigate the disappearence of a number of people in Chile, among which are some Spaniards, has been approved. Suarez says, "Portugal enters the European community, or we return to totalitarianism". Many Italian doctors are refusing to perform abortions. What are you looking at? The way that car is painted. Don't laugh, he'll get the wrong idea. Ah. What do you want? Fill it up. Of course, sir. Do you want me to check the oil? Yes, please. Pablo. Pablo, come here. What's happened? Look, someone has been in the house. Don't be afraid. My God. What a mess! Look at what they've done. Good heavens! What is that? Look at the state of the house! Shocking! And we have lost the phone. Now you see how people enjoy themselves nowadays, by destroying. It's a surprise. And not a pleasant one! Very decorative. They're mine. I see. They certainly had a good time. They finished off everything we had. Bah! They had hearty appetites, and as you can see, there were a lot of them. That's the case with young people. I can see it now. Such pigs! We can't do anything. We can't do anything? We're going to call the police. Look, there are cigarette burns in the sheets. And on the bedspread, which only just came back from the dry cleaner's. What bad luck! It's the age we live in. If it was left to me, I can assure you that they'd pay for this. Don't get excited. It drives me crazy seeing all these young deadbeats hanging around eveywhere. Perhaps they weren't young people. I don't care if they were young or old! No, but you have it in for young people. I'd just like to get my hands on one of the swine who did this. All the clothes are still here. Why would they want them? They don't wear them. Don't you see what they're like? They've been here just for kicks. Pablo! Pablo, come here. Look how they spent the time. What a crazy idea, no? We'll paint the door and hide that filthy drawing. It seems evil. Hideous. Why... have they drawn that? We'll probably never know. Anna, would you mind getting me the binoculars? Just a moment. What are you looking at? What did I tell you? Come here. There you have them, look at them, see the way they are. Do you understand now? What? How, what? I'd bet my ass they're the ones who trashed the house. Who else could it have been? Why else is that scum here? They could be tourists. Tourists. You're so naive! Read the newspapers. You'll find out what these gangs of young sadists get up to everyday. Awful crimes. Done by drug addicts, some of them not even 16. If things carry on like this, our society is finished. Well, as they have eaten all we had and there's nothing left at home... ... we will have to go to the village to buy something at the supermarket. We could go out for supper. I'd prefer to clean and tidy the house. We'll be in a better mood as soon as all that mess is tidied up. As you wish. Come on, I'm going to make a list of what we need. I think that's everything. Well, if I forgot something, we'll buy it tomorrow. Anyway, here you go. Take it. Please, cheer up! It's just a setback. You're right, I'll be back soon. Don't be long, after what's happened, I don't like being here alone. Anna. Anna. Anna. Anna. Anna. I needed to rest for a while. I had a headache, you know? Are you better now? Yes. If you want, I'll put a bolt on the door so you won't have to block it with the chair. No, don't do that. It was just a stupid thing. Thanks. What's that? I found them while cleaning the house. Do you think they're drugs? Probably, yes. I found some of them, in the bathroom. I see. What do these people feel when they smoke drugs? Oh! Who knows. It's like a madness. The human being becomes depraved, to the maximum degree of bestiality. Have you ever met a drug addict? I met someone who smoked marijuana. But they weren't addicted to drugs. And you, have you ever taken drugs? Who, me? I don't like that kind of outrage. It must be horrible, mustn't it? To live a life like that. People like us, who have a normal life, don't know how happy we are. I know that sometimes my attitude towards today's youth gets a little bit annoying... ... but I just can't get on with certain kinds of people. You're right. You've only known the nice side of life up to now. Your parents were serious minded and they gave you a strict upbringing. Perhaps too puritanical, according to some. For me, as decency is still a virtue, I think your parents did what they had to do. Tomorrow I'll go to see the police and I'll show them these. We'll see what they say. Be careful. Don't get in trouble with the police. Don't worry, they know me. I love you. What are you looking at in the middle of the night? The farm. You're beginning to really scare me. Don't worry. Do you see something unusual? No. That dogs annoying! It's at the farm. I hope it stops that barking. I'll talk with Andres tomorrow. Hi, good morning! Good morning Andres, how are you? Fine, and you? Fine. And your wife? Well, thanks, she's at home. No, thanks. I've not seen your friend's car. Ah, they went to the beach to take an early morning swim. They're crazy about the sea. Did you know that someone broke into our house? Really? Yes, some scumbags had a party there. I see. I haven't seen anything strange, but you know, I never leave here... sometimes I go to the fields, but, with my mother being ill. Oh, of course. How is Juana? There's nothing to do, the doctor has already said it. Blimey. She won't see the autumn. And them? Them two girls? They fell asleep and the others left them here. I don't know what they say... but they're good people. They look after their own interests and don't disturb anyone. They play guitars and have a good time. Sometimes, they help with the animals without me even asking. They come from Holland. Far away. But do they pay you? Psss, you know. Don't be silly and make them pay you. They're taking advantage of you. They pay me, more or less, as they can. So, you don't know who broke into my house? No. Ok, see you later. Say hello to your mother and I hope she gets better. Bye. Oh, Andres, your dog spent all night barking. Try to do something about it. Bye. Take this. That's it. Oh, here they are again. They don't have a better place to go, it just has to be here. They're not disturbing us at all. Maybe not you, but I'm sick of the sight of them. It's not that bad. In broad daylight, they don't seem so dangerous. They should have stayed in their own country. Don't be grumpy. We don't need their kind of tourism. They're so crass! Come on, put some suntan cream on and shut up. You're such a nuisance. That's not my suntan cream. Dammit, Anna, what a day! No sense of decency! Tomorrow we're going to take a swim elsewhere. If you agree, of course. Of course, I agree. I don't care, it's just for you. I imagine that it's not very nice for you, to see a man playing the fool by walking around naked on the beach. It really doesn't matter to me, as you can understand. Pablo, what's wrong with you? You've been in a really bad mood since we got here, and the worst part is, that it seems to be my fault. You? You could have fooled me! Don't talk nonsense. Sorry, if I've been disagreeable. Thanks. This is where I want to dive to. It seems there are some amazing caves, and the daylight can be seen from there. I'd never go down to a place like that. There's no danger. Why don't you stop it? Stop what? Going down to those caves. But, what's wrong? I don't know, I've had a bad feeling since we came here. Oh, don't be so gloomy. Sorry. Here they are once again. What do they want? Nothing, just trying to be funny. What do they want? Do they want me to hit a tree just to let them pass? Don't keep looking back, they'll think we like this joke. They're crazy. These boys will have to put up with it. Who's acting more like a boy now, you or them? Don't talk rubbish, Ok? So, let them pass. You know me Anna, when I say no, it's no. Come on Pablo, don't start again. Do not insist. Pablo, come on, let them pass! Take this. Like that. Yes. How are you? I'm really sick. It's been a wonderful day. Look how tanned I am! Yes. Look, and in just one day! Yes, you're really tanned. I think maybe too much, I advised you not to sunbathe for so long. Don't you think it doesn't look nice, the different colors of the skin? Well, it'll become the same color little by little. I think I'm going to buy a two piece bikini. What do you think? Are you asking me? Do you agree? Why not? but mini-mini? Bah, come on. I just wanted to tease you. You know I like it when you get annoyed. Be careful, you're hurting me Pablo! Sometimes, I have the feeling intimate relations are difficult for you. As if you do it because you think it's your duty. But deep down it's something that disgusts you. Don't exaggerate. No, I'm not exaggerating. When it's like that, so hasty... I've told you many times, for me, it's a very important moment. As I think it must be for every woman. I have never talked about this, neither with my friends, nor anybody else. But I think... ... I think that if a man acts on his passion, fast and mechanically, I don't know, but can't it sexually frustrate a woman? Are you frustrated? I haven't said that. No, but you gave me to understand it. I have always tried not to offend your modesty. You were gone so long. I didn't think so. For me it was a long, long time. Come on, tell me. What did you find down there? Many amazing things, come with me one day and enjoy the spectacle. You should see it, it's quite stunning. Yes, I believe you. What about dinner? It's done. So, lets go. I think she has my bracelet. That girl. Are you sure? I don't know. This is all so delicate. Are you completely sure? Be sure because I'm going to drag her to the police station. Come on Pablo, you know I get nervous when I see you like this. Sit down. I don't like violent situations. The house was littered with cigarette butts like this one. I don't think they came to steal, but they ate and drank everything. They were dirty and broke many things. Do you want to make a formal complaint? I think that's obvious, isn't it? Against who? Do you suspect somebody? Yes, a gang of yobs who have been hanging around the house. But do you have any proof, or a well-founded suspicion, that they did it? I don't like the look of them. If we had to arrest everybody we don't like the look of... And the cigarette butts? We'll see. You don't even know if they were the ones who smoked them. No, of course not, but I have my reasons to suspect them. How much is it? 61 pesetas for the magazine and postcards. The drink is already paid for. Paided for by who? Over there. Here you go. Bye. Where have you been that's it's taken you so long? I went to the harbor to talk with the owners of the yacht. What's the matter? You're acting strangely. The drawing, the drawing they did in the bathroom. Yes? Why did they do it? I don't know. Do you still think they are the ones who broke into our house? You can't doubt it. I've been thinking about what you told me, about those gangs of sadistic youths. I'm afraid. Perhaps they're part of one of those devil cults. I won't feel safe until they've left the seaside. I'll make sure they don't disturb us again. Be careful. You get up early, don't you? If I was a few years younger, I'd give you a good seeing to. Do you know why cows have that sad look in their eyes? You don't understand me, do you? Or perhaps you do. Because all of you are very intelligent. Take this, for your dog. So you don't know why cows have that sad look in their eyes? Because everyone touches their tits, but, in the end, nobody fucks them. What are you doing? Be careful, some of those things are expensive. Stop, stop, get off me. Leave me alone, leave me alone. I'm gonna kick your asses if you do anything to me. You can laugh now, but you'll have a nightmare soon. Stop kidding, Ok. That's enough, stop now. What the hell are you going to do to me? Sons of bitches. Bastards. Drunkards. Shut up, shit, shut up. Heh, listen, come here. Is anything wrong? How long have they been here? I don't know... two weeks? I ask the questions. You live here, you should know. Two weeks? Three? How long have they been here? Yes, that long, exactly, because they came here the day of the storm and that was... two weeks ago. Do you often willingly take guests, without declaring it? What do you mean? If you go to a hotel, you must sign in. Your name, address, where you live and who you are. Do you understand? That's what you have to do when people stay at your house. Fuck. It wasn't me, I didn't call the police. It was him, the bastard from the beach house. He reported you. Do you understand me? The owner of the beach house, because he thinks you broke into his house. It was him, not me. Yes, yes, I'll make a note. Yes, make a note. Yes, sir, you've told me three times that a son of a bitch stole your car. Now, give me the registration number. Repeat the number... once again. Don't be nervous, sir. Listening? Yes. There's nothing in the car. We've had a look around, everything is ok. Well, well. We'll send them far away to sunbathe anyway. Where are those crazy people today? I don't know and I'm not interested either. Do you miss them? No, but people don't bother me. Yes, I know. Because you like the human race. I hate it instead. I think Nero was right when he said that... ... I wish all you Romans had only one neck! To be able to chop it just with one cut. I don't understand you. How can you admire a monster like Nero! I don't admire Nero. I don't like it when you talk like this. We are all people and, if we had only one neck... are you and me and our parents included in that neck? No, come on, don't make a big deal out of this nonsense. I don't hate the human race, Anna. I just hate, the part that is hateful. If you'd had to make your way through life as I've done... ... you'd probably have a less pleasant concept of it. Maybe, but don't spoil my life just because you're a bitter person. Bitter person, me? How could someone of my position be bitter? Me, who has always got what he wanted. As much in my personal life as my professional one. Me, that has a woman like you... ... who is only for me. So do you still think I'm a bitter person? Come on, let's take a swim. We need to refresh our ideas. Should I prepare some martinis before supper? I think it's a wonderful idea. I'm going to take a shower first. I'll go after you. I love you and it's the only thing that counts. Look, I'm very happy that I've have found it. It was among the clothes, inside a drawer in the wardrobe. I see. And you were ready to go to the police station to report them. You wanted to drag that girl to the police station by her neck. I still remember it. Thank goodness you didn't do it. It's not a very valuble jewel anyway. That's why they didn't take it. What matters to me, is it's sentimental value, not its commercial value. Yes, I know. Despite everything, I'm happy I won't have to see that gang of yobs anymore. Pablo? Yes. What would you do if you knew, or I told you that, I've been with another man? Yes? This question is so ridiculous. How can I imagine something like that? You, with another man. Heavens! As though it was impossible. Almost. Why? You do know that other couples get up to much weirder things, don't you? They aren't a couple as we are. You're not very open-minded, you know? So, now you find I'm not very open-minded. And what do you understand as open-mindedness? Letting you cheat on me? Of course. And if instead of actually going with a man, I had just wished it? That's it, just to have wished that something happened with someone. That's more feasible, isn't it? But, why are you talking about this? No reason, just curiosity. So, now you know. No, I don't, because you haven't answered my question. My answer is, change the topic of conversation. As you wish, I'm going for more ice cubes. Yes, that's for the best. What are you doing here? He doesn't understand you. I'll make him understand me. What do you want? No, we don't have a phone. If you want to make a call, go to the village. This is a private property. Go on, go away. Pablo! Calm down, darling. Bring the money we have and give it to him. The police must be after him. Keep calm, he's not getting out of this one. The police? Why? How do you know the police are after him? Because they arrested them, but he must have got away. Did you report them? Why did you do that, Pablo? Why did you report them? They didn't do anything to us. They broke into our house. This trash think they can walk around doing just what they want. I want them to pay. Or do you think I'm not being open-minded enough? I'm scared, I wish he wouldn't look at me like that. It's like he's undressing me with his eyes. Don't worry, darling. No! Drop the gun. Pablo, please! Come on, drop it. Pablo, sit down, Pablo. Let her go. No! Pablo, Pablo, no, please. Pablo, please, listen to me and don't interrupt me. I know what I have to do. You're pale as a ghost. That doesn't matter now. Listen, I've been thinking all this time and we shouldn't build our hopes up. We won't survive if we continue like this. He's getting more and more excited and he's going to kill us. If we want to survive, we must do something at once. I don't want to die, Pablo, and I don't want you to die, either. We both have much to live for. What do you mean? I'm going to give him what he wants. Are you crazy? Anna, look at me. You're insane! Don't think I'm going to let you do it. It's not about you or letting me do it. It's about me not wanting to die. I don't want him to kill us. Anna! Do you think he's going to leave without getting what he wants? Do you think so? He's going to force me to do it sooner or later, and then he's going to kill us. At least let me try something positive. We have to put all our eggs in one basket, darling. I know it's really hard, but it's the only way to escape from this nightmare. You wait for the right moment and run away. Anna, I won't allow you to do it. I won't, do you hear me? Don't touch her! Please. My God. Coward! You're a coward. Why are you standing there like a statue? Do something! I don't want to see you again! I do not even want to look at you. I wish I were a man. Why am I not a man? Give me a little bit of time. No wine? No wine. Come here. Anna! Calm down, darling. No, no Pablo, no. Be quiet. Come on. Why did you hit him while he was defenseless?
