Good, that was lovely. Moll, I need more from you. Can we take it from the beginning? And... I was obsessed by killer whales when I was a kid. They always seem to be smiling. You know, they travel a hundred miles a day in the ocean. But in captivity, their sound waves bounce off the walls and they become deaf and dumb. Some even go insane. I read about one whale that broke all its teeth trying to break free. Just got too much for him. He didn't want to smile any more. I'll have a pint of Heineken and a glass of red wine, please. And a packet of crisps. - Hey, Cliff. - Hey. - How are you? - Yeah, good. You? - Yeah, no, I'm good, I'm good. - Good. Just, hang on a sec. Cliff, you didn't have to, honestly. - Please. Happy birthday. - Thank you. They give you one of these when you enter the force. Thank you. That's fine. It just goes, - just anywhere. Yeah, anywhere. - Anywhere, yeah. - I think I'm... - Just, Sorry. May I? It's okay. You're not really supposed to give these away but you can keep a secret. - Hiya! - Better say hi. No, of course. - Thanks for coming. - Not at all. - I'll see you later. - Yeah. And help yourself to more drinks and there's plenty of food as well if you want anything to eat. Okay. Sure. Who gave you that? Oh, um, Clifford. How sweet. I'd like to make a toast to someone very special, someone we can all rely on. Happy birthday, sis. - To Moll! - To Moll! And, while she's got you lot to be quiet for the moment... We would like to take this opportunity to announce Spence and me are expecting twins. Get the champagne, sweetheart, there's a case in the garage. There's champagne? Don't pull that face. She's having twins, Moll. Come on! Over here! What are you doing? I frightened you. Hang on, I've got to go home. Oh, come on, I spent the whole night buying you drinks. I know, I... I've got to get home and look after my dad. He'll be all right. Just a little kiss. Don't do that, please. Why? Don't. Wait, I... I need to get home. I know you want it. Don't... Don't. - Just a little kiss. - Don't... Don't. - I don't... I need to get home. - Just a little kiss, come on. - Don't! Please don't do that! - Hey! What are you doing, you freak? What? Do you know how to use that? You're wounded. Well, I can fix that. Get in. No, thanks. Doesn't hurt? You have blood on your hands. Isn't that illegal? Can you keep a secret? Then, I'm okay. Just missing a section on humans. Shit. You don't have to tell them what happened. - You sure? - Yeah. I don't want any trouble. - Morning, officer. - Seat belt. Yeah, sorry. We just got on the road. Up early. You mean late, we've been at the Wipeout. The, um, the DJ was great, we couldn't stop dancing. You can breathalyse me. Incidentally, I'm an amazing dancer. Really? And what do you do? Work with my hands, I'm a craftsman. You? I'm a historical guide. Not the granny wagons? It's only temporary. Nice place. Yeah, it's... It's my parents'. I'm just helping look after my dad. Someone's birthday? Mine, actually. - Happy birthday. - Thank you. Thanks for the, um, lift. You're safe. I was worried sick. What happened? - I, um... - Come here. I won't bite. I felt funny, so I went for a walk. And I fell asleep on the beach. - I thought we were best friends. - We are. Then don't lie to me. I just wanted to go dancing. I put all that effort into making it special and you wanted to go dancing. I'm so sorry. Mum, it was irresponsible and thoughtless. You've come so far, Moll. I worry when things like this happen. It won't happen again, I promise. It was your birthday. We'll let this one go. Eat your cake. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen and welcome to Tantivy Blue Coach Tours. My name's Moll and I will be your hostess for the day. Um, just to give you a rough outline of what you can expect from today's travels. Firstly, um, we will... What are you doing here? Just wanted to check how you're doing. Yeah, I'm... I'm good, thank you. Here, birthday present. Thank you. It's my... My mum. - Hilary. - Pascal Renouf. How do you do? Your dad needs you, sweetheart. Have a pleasant evening. - Who was that? - No one. Just... He gave me a lift the other night. Could smell him a mile off. My name's Moll. What are you doing Saturday? There's a few odd jobs around the house. A bench needs fixing and some patio slabs. And you said you were good with your hands. Okay, Saturday. What homework have you got tonight, Jade? Usual. Bit of maths, bit of science. Hey. - How was the game? - Cock-up. Lost 50 quid. Mum, can Jade stay here tonight? I've got a friend coming over. I've got a fête meeting, sweetheart. Moll can look after her. Everyone is hoping for the best. But there is of course speculation that Melissa's disappearance is connected to the unsolved abduction and murder of three other girls over the past four years. It's been 22 hours since I saw Melissa tucked up in bed. And if anyone can help us to find her... We miss her very, very much. - Harrison, turn it off. - We miss... How was the game? It was great. Whose house is this? It's ours, Dad. That's everything. Thanks. You've got, um... You want to go for a ride? Come on. I got you. You're unbelievable, Moll. What? What did I do? - Oh, come on! - Harry. You left Jade alone. With Dad. He doesn't know what the fuck's going on! - Well, you were supposed to be here. - Moll. Sit down. Where were you? I just needed to pop into work. You're lying again. You went off with that Pascal, didn't you? We just went for a drive. Sophie Healey's daughter is missing there's a killer stalking this island and you abandoned her because you wanted to go for a drive? She's family! Families are supposed to look after each other. But the only thing that seems to matter in your world is you. That's not true. So you must be plain stupid. Is that it? You don't know the difference between right and wrong? I know the difference. So you're selfish? Are you going to apologise to your niece? - It's okay... - Be quiet! I'm sorry. For? I'm sorry for being selfish. I'm sorry for being selfish and for being a liar. Okay, that's enough. Let's be friends again? You need to pick your daughter up on time. Moll around? She's busy this evening. Maybe I can get her to call you... Hey. So I was just off down the pub, wondered if you wanted to get shit-faced? - We're about to have dinner. - There's plenty. I never get the measurements right. Well, I never turn down food. - Is Renouf a Jersey name? - Yeah. I'm about as local as they come. My ancestors were Norman noblemen. They owned a lot of the west coast probably the land we're on right now. Where are you from? You're on my land. Who are your parents? Victor and Maude. And what do they do? Passed away. I'm sorry. It's all right. It was a long time ago. What's your take on this maniac? Can we talk about something else? He might have some native intuition. You know what? I'm with Mum. Can we talk about something else? I bet it's that Porco - from L'Etac Farm. - Hear, hear. - I'm sure of it. - Sorry about this. It's okay, people often adopt the values that they're born into. - What's that supposed to mean? - Just what I said. I just don't think that Moll needs to apologise on your behalf, that's... Where's Spencer? Geneva. My fiancé is a pilot. Watch your step. Moll's a wild one. - All right, Vic? - All right, mate? What can I get you? A bottle of Liberation and, um... I'll have the same, thanks. So... "Wild one"? Yeah, that was a long time ago. You gotta give me something. I hurt someone. When I was 13, I stabbed a girl. What? I was bullied at school and this one day in class, this girl came at me and I... Well, I can't really remember what happened but one minute, I'm holding some scissors and the next, they're sticking out of her. And what happened? I was expelled. Mum quit her job and schooled me at home. Tried to weed the bad out of me. You're a good person, Moll. You don't know me. I know that people make mistakes. If you keep carrying that around with you, you won't be able to stand up straight. I reckon you're one of those super-bright home-schooled kids. You can do anything you want. Yeah. Well, I don't know, maybe. Fuck, country night. Am I going to try and do that? It's a short-cut. You scared? It's just here. Christ. One minute the sun's out and... Now, obviously, you've, you've seen the news. Yeah. I just wanted to ask you a few questions. How long have you known Pascal Renouf? A couple of weeks. And what's the nature of your relationship? We're lovers. This isn't easy but I need to ask about your love life. Look, Moll, I'm the last person in the world that wants to ask this but we're dealing with an extremely dangerous individual. So it's important for me to know if there's anything out of the ordinary. It's not ordinary, it's amazing. Melissa Healey went missing on the night of your birthday. It's important that we get a full picture of that night so tell me what happened. Um... As you know, there was a barbecue at my house and I... wasn't enjoying myself. So I went to the Wipeout about 10:00. I met Pascal there and we danced until closing. You going to tell me what this is about? Pascal was on a list of suspects a few years back. Now, his stories always checked out but I was never convinced. How many people were on this list? I can't go into that, Moll. All right, well, I need to go. I shouldn't be showing you this. Pascal Renouf. Previous convictions. Vandalism, three cases, six accounts of dangerous driving two of affray illegal poaching, countless times. At 18, he was sentenced to 12 months for indecent assault on a minor. She was 14. You might want to rethink how amazing he is. Keep up the good work, Cliff. Well, I think they should just tell you the truth about it... You gave me goose bumps. Thanks. We practised enough. So, where you been hiding, then? I just... I've been really busy. - I called. - Yeah, I know. I just... I have a lot on at the moment. Yeah, well, I'll... I'll see you around, then, yeah? Yeah. That's my girl. Hey. Hey. I thought I'd lost you. Can we talk? No! No! - No! - ...girls around here. Come on. You know you want to say something. Just talk to us. - Just talk... - All right, easy, easy. - What's that? - Everything okay? I'm just talking to my friend Nuno here. He's got something he wants to get off his chest. Let's just calm down, yeah? "Calm down"? I'm sorry. Who are you? I'm Pascal Renouf. You have a daughter, Pascal? I do. Two. And as a father, it's my job to keep them safe. - But you understand that, don't you? - I didn't do anything. And that's what I'm doing, trying to get this Porco scum... You're just a racist bully! Why don't you just leave him alone? Go fuck yourself. - Don't do that. - What are you going to do? Fuck! Get off! Knock it off! Get off of me! - Break it up! Easy, easy. - All right, all right, all right! - Get off! - Get off him! - Cool down! - Get off! Walk that way! Clifford questioned me. It was about you. About your past. What the fuck did he say? Don't do that. I want to know what the fuck you were talking about behind my back! That you hurt someone. What? Who? A girl, a 14-year-old girl. That's what he told you? That I hurt her? Just tell me what happened. It was consensual. Okay? We liked each other. But the parents had it in for me. They turned her against me. They made her say all sorts of shit. I... I regret it every single day. He thinks you're the man that's been killing those girls. Do you think it's me? Hey. Hey, don't walk away from me! What the fuck do you want from me? I want you to tell me that you didn't do it! I lied for you! I said we were together that night and I need to know I did it for the right reason! Yeah, well, you don't need to lie for me any more! I'll get through this by myself. Oh, God, I don't understand you. How can you ask me that? I love you and you're asking me that! Hey. - Hey! - What? You just said you love me. Why? I don't know. Just... Just happened. Look, if you know what's good for you, you'll turn and walk away. But I didn't hurt those girls. I won't walk away from you. I love you. Hi. Thank you. Feel a bit underdressed. You look lovely. Wait, just that. - What are you doing? - Just that little there. - So who's this lot, then? - Um... - I think your mum fancies me. - I think she does. I'll see you. - I'll take that, thanks. - Sure. Thank you. Hi. - Congratulations again. - Oh, thank you. I didn't expect to see... My boyfriend? Wow! Good for you. What is it about him? His smell. - Oh, he's wearing jeans. - They're black jeans, Polly. You know what they're like here. You look great. Everyone loves you. Thanks. Oh, I've just seen someone, sorry. You need to put a leash on him. He's just playing with Jade. He's ruining the grass. Your father's been acting up, where have you been? I'm in a relationship, Mum. I can't be there all the time. Sweetheart, you can't just change the rules because someone's shown an interest. Maybe I've been too soft on you. There we go. You kind of scared me. I'm sorry, sir, but jeans aren't allowed in the clubhouse. It's the club dress code. But they're black jeans! I'm sorry. - So, maybe the burger, then? - Yes. I'd like to make a toast. To my family for everything you've done for me I forgive you. Get out! Actually, wait here. You can do it. Use the weight as you come down and make sure that that's at a right angle there. Okay. Yes! No! No! - I haven't got it in me. - Yeah, you do. Anticipate its movements. Feel its every breath every heartbeat. It's still alive. It's crueller if you leave it like that. I can't. Yeah, you can, just pick it up by its back legs. I don't want to. All right, all right. You okay? Yeah. What's that? Open the door! Hello? What's going on? - Is your name Pascal Renouf? - Yeah. I'm DCI Steven May. What? What are you talking about? She's up here. What's going on? Wait here. Moll, this is DCI Theresa Kelly. She's come over from the mainland to help with the investigation. Firstly, I'd like to apologise for the surroundings. We have a lot of people working on this and we need the extra space. Just to establish you are not under arrest but you are under caution. You do not have to say anything but it may harm your defence if you do not mention when questioned something which you later rely on in court. Anything you do say can be given in evidence. Do you understand? Bit of a mouthful, that one. Please state your full name. Can I just leave? Why would you do that? Have you got something to hide? No. Name. Moll Huntford. Tell me what you were doing the night Melissa Healey was abducted. June 8th of this year. It was my birthday. I had a barbecue at my house and I decided to leave. So I went to the Wipeout about 10:00. About 10:30, I met Pascal, we danced all night and left at closing. Why did you leave your own birthday party? I wasn't enjoying the company. Do you know a Mr Leigh Dutot? Are you saying you've never met him? No. Not to my knowledge. Here you are engaging in conversation with him. Well, I was drunk, I can't remember everyone I met. He said you danced all night together. Moll, you won't get into any trouble if you change your statement. You have my word. Show us the pictures of the dance floor. That's where I met Pascal. Clifford, go and get some sleep. Cause of death was suffocation. He filled her mouth with earth. Why are you showing me these? I need you to understand the gravity of what we're dealing with. He doesn't love you, Moll. He can't love. And you can't appeal to his humanity. He doesn't have any. Not again. They'll be back on in a moment. I entered the Wipeout at 10:00 p.m. Shortly afterwards, I met Pascal. We danced all night and left at sunrise. You weren't popular in school, were you? I was bullied. So was I. So were lots of people. - But you tried to kill a girl. - No. It was a mistake. I was defending myself. You see, it makes me wonder... Are you protecting Pascal because you think he's innocent or is this just another way of taking revenge on the world? You think because you sing in the choir and you help look after your father you can fool people into thinking you're someone else. Good morning, Miss Huntford. I'd like to ask you a few questions for Channel Television. Miss Huntford. Miss Huntford! Okay, let's just do this here. You ready? I'm standing outside the house of Pascal Renouf a local man with a previous conviction for sexual assault. He's being held for questioning for a further 36 hours. Now, this is all happening on the day of Melissa Healey's funeral so emotions and tensions... Miss Huntford! Miss Huntford! Just a couple of questions, please, just need to ask you. Just a couple of questions. Miss Huntford, please! ...explore some of the rugged and wild landscape and give you a chance to whet your appetite before lunch by tasting some of the wines of Jersey in one of Jersey's largest vineyards. After that, we will be then going up to the... Over to the east. We'll be going over... I'm so sorry. Terry, do you mind pulling... - Thank you, have a nice day! Bye. - Thanks so much. You, too. - Green looks great on redheads. - Yeah, I've got one just like it. Then... What about this? Moll Huntford. Would you like to, um, try it on? I just wanted to talk to you. About? About what happened. It was 14 years ago. I know, I just wanted to set things right. So you came to my shop? I'm so sorry about what happened. It was a mistake. I'm a good person. What's wrong with you? Nothing's wrong with me. I was defending myself. What? Are you saying I deserved this? No. No. No, no, I'm not... Get the fuck out of here. Get out! Please be seated. How can we begin to find words to express the grief in the hearts of Lionel and Sophie? Nothing will take away the loss you have suffered and nothing will replace the pain in our hearts today. You need to leave. But we may take some comfort that the perpetrator will be judged and will have to account for his actions... Fuck off. ...like all of us. Because God's judgment never fails... For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ that each may receive what is due for what he has done whether good or evil. What are you doing? I just want to offer my condolences. No, leave with me and we'll forget about everything. Okay? It'll be just like it was. Moll, please don't. I'm so sorry for your loss. Hey! Where do you think you're going? Hey! Hey! Can we talk? Inside? Leave it open. We got him. Nuno Alvarez, Portuguese man, worked on the farms. He finally made a mistake. I just wanted you to hear it from me and I wanted to apologise for everything I've put you through. What, it's... It's over? Yes. It's over. This doesn't mean that Pascal isn't bad news. And it doesn't change the way I feel about you. Do you know what I dislike most about you, Cliff? Your smell. What would you have done if it was me? But it wasn't. Must have crossed your mind. I believed in you. - Would you still love me? - What? Why are you asking me that? My mother left me when I was in prison. I never heard from her again. She told me she loved me. Hey. I'm still here. It's over. You all right with that? I'm sorry. Watch the waterfall. All right? Come on, I want to dance! Come on. All right. I want to leave this place. But you just bought another round. No, no, no, no, the island. We could just run away. We could just go somewhere really hot or, or cold or I don't know, I don't know, just somewhere. I've got a life here, I've got a business, a house. I can't live here, Pascal. I gave up everything for you. Yeah, well, I didn't ask you to give everything up. I lied for you! And I appreciate that but you can't just rip my life apart because you don't like the weather! Hey, you're hurting me. Good, maybe it'll sink in. Keep your fucking mouth shut! - You got something to hide? - Don't push me. What are you going to do? You going to hurt me? Go on! Go on! Fucking hurt me like you hurt that girl. I'm sorry. I'm sorry... Moll! Moll! I need to talk to you. What do you want? How do you know it was him? - Who? - Nuno Alvarez. Evidence. His DNA was all over her. Did he... Did he confess? - He said they were on a date. - Maybe they were. With a 16-year-old girl who was murdered that evening? Yeah, I'm not being funny but that's pretty unlucky. So... you going to tell me what this is about? Now, you can talk to me, Moll, you know that. Regardless of what happened. I lied. I didn't see Pascal at the Wipeout. You think it's Pascal? Why are you smiling? You know, I was always there for you but you wanted a bit of rough. - You're a monster. - So I'm a monster? You're the one who lied during a multiple murder investigation. What's wrong with you? Nothing's wrong with me. Do you want to go to jail? Is that it? No? - No. - No. Get out. Go on, fuck off. Pascal? Hey. Hey. Where have you been? I had to think about a lot of things. I'm sorry about what I said last night. I didn't mean it. I feel terrible about last night. I was just, I was... I was drunk and, um... What with everything that's happened, I just lost it. I'm really... I'm sorry. And look, if you still want to go away, then... You want to leave this place, I'm in. You'd do that for me? I'd do anything for you. No cities, I need mountains or sea. How about Norway? You get both. Yeah. Viking country, I could do that. I need to tell you something. I know it was you. What? I know it was you. This a wind-up? You were sick. You had a sickness and it overpowered you and you fought it for a long time and now you're better and I need to hear you say it. I need us to be absolutely honest with each other if we're going to start a new life together. You need help. I'm not who I say I am. The girl I stabbed, it wasn't an accident, it was revenge. I tried to kill her. You tried to kill a girl? Why... Why are you telling me this? I'm telling you because I know you'll understand. Whatever you've done and whoever you've hurt I can understand because we're the same. And so from the deepest part of who I am I accept you. And I won't give up on you, not for them not for anything that you've done. I'm prepared to give you all of my love as deep and as powerful as a human can give another human. But I need... I need you to tell me it's over. It's over. They were nothing to me. Hi, guys. Sorry about the wait. Here's your steaks. Is there anything else I can get for you? Any mustard or mayonnaise? Okay, enjoy your meal, then. Cheers. Cheers. Can we get out of here? Kiss me. Wait, wait. We're the same.
