[Chattering] Mildred, this is Gus, Bernt, and this is Big Tommy. - Really good friend of mine. - Hello. Hello, Mildred. That accent kills me. [Mimics] "Hello, Mildred." - French, huh? - French-Canadian from Quebec. "Quebec"! Mmm, swear to God, you kill me. - Gus, tell Danny we want some drinks. - Hey, Danny, come on. Cocktails over here. - Guys, this is Mildred. - Hi, I'm Bernt. - Hi. Tommy. - How are you? - This is big Tommy. - Big Tommy. - Big Tom. Hello, I'm Mildred. - Hi, I'm Gus. This is my best friend. Mildred Hawkes. She's like a second mother to my J.J. - She's great. - Hey, banana. Whaddya gonna have? I'm gonna have a 7-7. Big surprise, huh? And whatever these guys are drinkin'. - All right. - Okay, it's all on me tonight. Don't let them pay for one drink. Mildred, you want something? Do you drink? Oh, yes. Yes. When l... When I was younger... I was quite a drinker. - Yeah? - I could drink more than my husband... and he was a very large man. - [All Laughing] - It was quite embarrassing for him. So, tonight's your lucky night. So what are you having? Umm... Vodka. Something with vodka. Uh, what? Okay. Mm-hmm. Um... Martini. [All Laughing] [Laughing] My brother died when I was 22 years old. Yes. 22 years old. Skiing. - Just had a heart attack. - [Laughing] He died on the slope. Well, you know, after telling my parents... It was very, very hard. I had to go buy him some clothes to be buried in, because... because his wife and our family didn't speak. This is a d-different story. So I'm going down to the garment center... and I run across this little guy, and I tell him, "I need a shirt," and he says, "for five dollars more, I'll give you two shirts." I say, "I only need one shirt." So he shows me some shirts, and I pick one out. He says, "for five dollars more, I'll give you two shirts." I say, "I only need on shirt!" He says, "for five dollars more, I'll give you three shirts." I say, "it's for a dead body." - Oh! - "Oh," he say. "Okay, okay. I give you one shirt." My husband's dead, you know. [All Laughing] Oh, I am having such a good time. I just thank you. I mean, it's been so long... since I just sat around and shot the breeze, you know? - [Laughing] - Thank you. You... you, you and Tom. [Gus] Pool table's open. Let's go shoot some pool. Oh, yeah, sure, sure. Ladies, you want to play? - Yeah, l... Sure. L... I haven't played for a, for a long time. - Uh, no. No, no, no, no. You guys go ahead. This is girl talk. No? Okay. We're gonna stay. We're gonna have another drink. So... So what do you think? What do I think about what? About that man, sweetie. That big, male man who's staring at you. Oh, I don't think... Me? What do I think? - L... - Okay, okay, okay. Forget it. I gotta take a leak. Come on. Danny, two more drinks. So, Frankie calls again today. Same old shit. "I love you. "Please forgive me. I wanna come home. Waah, waah, waah," like a little fucking kid. - [Toilet Flushes] - So finally, I say, "Frankie..." "what the fuck does it take for you to wake up? "Hmm? There's a freshly opened can of coffee under your nose. "The kid doesn't wanna see you. He calls the mailman 'Daddy.' "I can't stand you. I don't love you. How clear is that, huh?" So he's being all nice, right? But as soon as I say I don't love him, he loses it. "You do too love me. I know you love me." I don't know why I do this, but I have my hand over the receiver... and I'm laughing my fucking ass off. I know what Frankie looks like when he gets mad. His face turns bright red. So, finally... he just blows a gasket. So he just hangs up. Why don't you let him see J.J.? Are you crazy? He put his hands on me. He's not putting his hands on my kid. Oh, come on. Okay. Yeah, okay. So... I'm breaking his balls a little bit. But you know what? He deserves it. Screw him. I know I might not be the perfect wife, but I ain't from Stepford. Nobody hits me. If I let him do it once, he'll always do it. I gotta bust his chops. You think I don't miss him? Think I'm not lonely? As long as it takes, he's gotta know: My person is off limits to his hands. Can I say something? Hey, what the... Where the fuck are our drinks, Danny? Am I invisible? It's unbelievable. Love, I have found, is temporary. It's, uh... It's stupid, but it's like a weed. You know, if it's there, you don't have to pay that much attention to it. It just... It just grows with just a little bit of water. But if you really try... you can kill it. It... It doesn't have a home, you know? It's transient. If it's not wanted, it'll just move on. I don't wanna butt in, but just be straight with your husband... because... I know you don't believe it... but he will stop loving you. [Grunts] Nothing. So, Mildred... since we're being real truthful tonight, baring our souls and all... I got a question for ya. - [Cue Hits Ball] - Aw, fuck! What's the deal with your daughter? Why does she hate you so much? Oh... I don't think she hates me really. - We're just so different. - [Balls Clacking] [Ball Drops Into Pocket] She's right at that age I can't stand. She hates being told what to do... and she does everything wrong. [Ball Drops Into Pocket] I don't blame her, really. I've always preferred my son. Anybody could tell that. What are you telling me? You like your son the best? Doesn't that violate a mother code? Aren't you supposed to like all your kids the same? Yeah. But you never do.

Yeah, fine, terrific. The best. Come on in. I wanna show you something. [Man] Hike! Two! Catch it. Turn around. [Chattering Continues] Ohh. I did it. I talked to Frankie. I was just straight with him. He walked into the creamery like Rudolph-Fucking-Valentino. He's got flowers and everything. At first I buy into it, but then I say "Screw you." I know I'm not a princess, but I'm not your fucking punching bag." Fuck me once, fuck you. Fuck me twice, fuck me. - Hut! - But he says he knows and he wants to talk. And I know he's got the Indian sign on me... but... we're gonna try it again. - I'm goin' to the end zone. - Thanks for taking care of Jay. Did I say his dad can pick him up from school again?

I'm cooking. Sit down. You want a drink? He's gonna be so happy to see you. Never stops talking about those books. No drink, thank you. How are you? I'm glad to see you. How's Frankie? Great. Hell, never been better. He's been like an angel. Picks up Jay from school, plays with him, talks to him about his job... reads to him at night, puts him to bed. He really missed him. We're doing pretty fucking good too. Hate to jinx it. It's like the fucking Brady Bunch or something. How about you? How you been? I haven't seen you in a while. Fine, fine. Busy. Hi, Auntie Mildred. I haven't seen you in a long time. - What are you doing here? - I just happened to be on my way to the park... and I have some sandwiches and cookies I don't think I can finish by myself... so I thought maybe, if you weren't busy, you'd come along with me. Oh. It's okay, Jay. He has baseball practice with his dad at 4:30. Oh, is that what that long face is about? Don't worry about that. We can do it anytime. We can go tomorrow, if you'd like. I'm sorry, Auntie Mildred. I have Cub Scouts tomorrow. Okay. Good. Wow! I c... that's pretty exciting. I didn't know you were big enough for Cub Scouts. Yeah, it's with my school. And this weekend I'm gonna visit my grandma's house with my mom and dad. You can come too. We can read books and play and spell and stuff. You can show my dad. He doesn't read very well. Well... yeah. Maybe. Maybe, Jay. Well, I gotta go. I'm goin' to the park. I love you, Auntie Mildred. I love you too, sweetheart. Dad, can we go to the park and see if Auntie Mildred is still there?

L-I got a job down at the bookstore on Harris Street. I was thinking of going to Saddleback and getting a degree. You're doing it. All the right things. Job, school. Although I think you should get into something involving mathematics. You always had a very high aptitude for that, even though you never studied. You don't wanna be stuck behind a typewriter forever. [Sighs] Mom, I need a place. I'm selling the house, honey. I'm sorry. Selling? I had an offer, and I'm selling. - I have to be out by the end of the month. - Why? I mean, uh... You can't sell the house. I mean, for what? What are you gonna do, live in an apartment?

I don't know... but I'll tell you when I find it. You're nuts. You know that? There is something really funky goin' on here... something bad funky. [Bottle Opens] Do you remember when it used to be very early and cold? Or in the afternoon? And I would see Dad and... I would ask him when he was goin' to work. I was always rushing him because I didn't want him there. He would laugh, but you... You could tell he was upset. I don't know why I did that. I know Dad and I were never very close. He loved me and this and that, but... we were never very close, were we? Do you think I hurt his feelings? Little kids get jealous. They want all your attention all the time. I wouldn't worry about it. It was really a lot of fun... with you, Mom. Sometimes. Anyway... there's a lot of things that I wish I could do over. Bye. You're not gonna stay? No. Good-bye, my angel. I'll give you a call. - Need any money? - Mm-hmm. No, Mom. I'm okay. [Phone Ringing] - Yes? - Hello, Millie. Tommy Bellaveau here. I was thinking about dinner... and thought how much better it would taste dining with you. Are you busy? I could use the conversation. I need a half an hour. I heard you're really great with kids. I get along great with them when they're little... but I just drive 'em crazy when they get older. I can see why too, you know, because I just tell 'em too much. But they stay home too long also. If this was still an agricultural society, they'd be out at 16. They'd be married and starting their own family. There I go. How's J.J.? I don't know. I haven't seen him. You know, uh, his father moved back in with Monica. - They're very happy. - Oh. They worked it out. That's great. - Yes, it is. - Great. Listen, uh... I was thinking about getting a place in town. You know, just a place. Uh, well, I don't know... - You're moving? - Mm-hmm. And where to? Um, l... I don't know. My son is living in San Francisco now. He's got a new job. He makes lots of money. He's very successful. He wants me to move up there. - H-He needs me. - That's great. But I don't know. Maybe Miami. - Mmm. - Hmm? [Chuckles] Miami. [Brakes Decompress] [Engine Sputters, Shuts Off] - Good night. - Good night. I'll call you, okay? Huh? Millie. I had a good time, Millie. [Engine Starts] So Frankie sets up this whole big thing. It's great. This whole unbelievable romantic evening. It's about 10:00... and J.J.'s out. He puts on this music... Chet Baker. - Wow. - I'm looking at him like, this can't be Frankie. Who is this guy? Then he goes to the freezer where he's been hiding this bottle of champagne. He hands it to me, picks me up, Carries me into the bedroom. [Giggles] I mean, he lifted me. So I'm on the bed... he's on top of me, things are going pretty good, you know... except I can't get this bottle of champagne open. I'm pulling and I'm thumbing. Can't get it open. I hand it to him. He can't get it open either. Goes into the kitchen, sticks a corkscrew in it... it explodes. Glass, everything. We wind up sifting our champagne through a tea strainer. So finally, we get back into bed; I'm half naked; he gets a phone call. Oh, fuck! Right? I'm sitting there like an asshole. I hear him from the other room. He says, "Call me back in an hour. Better make it two." "Better make it two"? That was so incredibly sweet. So he runs back into bed, we have this incredible sex. - I mean, it was incredible. - [Boxes Sliding] [Panting] That's great. No, I mean it was un-fucking-real. But that's not it. He's making the time for me, you know? It's the effort. Yeah. The effort. Hey, l-I get the feeling you want me to stop talking. - Want me to shut up? - Yeah. [Grunting] Frankie and me, we're gonna make it, you know. We wanna make it. I know I do. And if he doesn't... he does now, but if he doesn't later, that's okay. It's out in the open, it's honest. - Just no more of that hitting shit, you know. - Yeah. - 'Cause that builds up and that's no good for anybody. - Right. That just explodes. Fuck that. That's over. - Right? - Right. Yeah, I'm right. Yeah. That's good. I'm good, and the job's good. Got that dicked. And... I forgot to tell you, my mother called the other day. She has this way of pushing my buttons. She does it real good. I'm talking to her... and she's doing her fucking guilt, head trip, whatever, bullshit... and I don't respond. I don't do anything. L-I mean, I don't not respond on purpose. It's just, I'm at a point where it doesn't affect me anymore, you know? Yeah, I know you know. Yeah. So she can get all bent, but that's her problem. Hook's outta my mouth. That's right. Hello. Hi. Come on in. - [Frankie] All packed up and ready to go, huh? - Almost. Isn't there something you wanted to talk to Mildred about... in private? Come on, we talked about it, huh? - We'll wait outside. - No, we'll go outside. Come on, Jay. [Door Opens, Closes] Okay. I wanna say thank you to you... 'cause you took care of me, helped my mom... and you're also very nice to me and you're my friend. So I should say thank you. Hey, what are you doing? You don't have to thank me. We're friends. You're my best friend. You're my main man. You don't have to say anything if you don't want to. It's okay. You know how I think... and I know how you think. I love you, Jay. It'll be okay. Am I ever gonna see you again? I sure hope so. We never did finish those encyclopedias, did we? No. Well, I gave 'em to your mom. You can have her read 'em to you, if you want to. Okay. Remember when you sang me that "Doggie in the Window" song... where you changed the animals and I didn't know how some of the animals sounded... and we laughed? Yes. That was fun. Mm-hmm. I liked that. Me too. Well, good-bye. Good-bye. God, you're really leaving. No more Auntie Mildred. What a thing. Ah, who knows? Maybe one day. You never know. Fucking Mildred. Did you forget anything? No, of course not. Who am I talking to? [Sniffles] Do you want me to stay? Because I'll stay. Yeah, I think I should stay. No, it's okay. It's all done. I'm gonna go then. [Sighs] Hey, are you okay? Um... yeah. No. [Sniffles] Fuck. We'll see where it all goes. Yeah. Good-bye, Millie. - Give me a ring and let me know how you're doing, okay? - I will. Okay, uh, is that it? Okay, Mrs. Hawkes. Sign right here. Thanks for the money. It was really too much. Don't worry, I won't go spending it all in one place. It's your money.
