Ana. Ana. Let's go to bed. Come on, let's go. Here. THE SLEEPWALKERS FOR SALE Hello, gorgeous. How's my favourite little girl doing? - Oh, don't start, Gran! - Sorry, I meant my favourite little guys. You were lucky, Luisa. You picked the best husband of this family. Well, Mum, there aren't any other husbands to choose from here. Sergio. Hi. Hello, my dear. What's this smoke? The next-door neighbours, it looks like they're burning leaves. What's up? Are you alright? This is the one you like. Thanks. Isn't it a little early to start? What? Drinking? No, it's a little late. We won't stop until New Year. This one's for you. You brought champagne. Yes, the place you mentioned had a good price. I bought it somewhere else. It was cheaper. Good for you. - Cheers. - Cheers. Come and help me, Martín. Hello, Hilda. Hello, my dear. How are you my love? How are you? Fine, my love. How are you doing? How nice to see you. I'll take this through. - I'll be right back. - Alright. Where should I put this, Mum? Here. Over here. Close the door, guys, or all the flies will come. Hey. Can I light them, Dad? What are you doing with that? Come on, let me set them off. It looks like I ruined your surprise. It's fine. Give it to your auntie to put away. Without kisses there are no sparklers. - Hi. - Hello. Is my mother around? Here I am. I've been calling you for ages, Mum. Stop it! If you don't, I'm taking you back home with your Mum. Come on, Shorty. Let's go and find some bugs Shall we hang it up later? Let's get changed now. Yeah, we should enjoy the nice day. Ana? I brought this for you. No, it doesn't fit me. What were you thinking of wearing? I don't know, nothing. This one will be fine, I'm sure. You can still get in the pool, you know? Why didn't you tell me anything? Dad. What? - Could you leave, Dad? - Ok. How long have you been having your period? Why didn't you tell me anything? There's not much to tell. What do you mean? It's really important. Just one time. Or two. But I wasn't sure. Anyway, I was going to tell you. I brought sanitary towels, if you need them. It's already finished. - 5. - Hop. - 9. - Hop. - 10. - Hop. - 14. - Hop. - 18. - Hop. Leandro. Names again? What? It's freezing. Get in, Shorty. Don't you want to? Why? That's enough. Do you want to play Hop? Do you? Where's the mosquito net, Mum? - 1. - Hop. - 28. - Hop. - 25. - Hop. - 31. - Hop. - 49. - Hop. - Ball. - Hop. Again. Your turn? Come on. So when did they put up the sign? When we got here it was already up. Guys! Go and see who it is. Come on. Who is it? Alejo! Alejo! Look at you! Where did this boy come from? Who knew? Did you know? I didn't know. I had no idea. How lovely! Mum, do you have some money on you for the car? I'll pay you back later! How much is it? Look at you. He's turned into a man. Here you go. He went away a boy and came back a man. What a beautiful thing. What a nice surprise! It was my idea, Luisa. It was something logical. - There's a baby next door. - What about these stairs? It's nothing, my love. Ana knows the house by heart. Besides, I have the keys for all the doors. Excuse me. Why don't the cousins sleep here? Ask your gran. There's no need to bother your gran. They're three lads... and a baby next door. What does that matter? There are three of us too. We always sleep in the annex. Alright, Ana. He's not come here for five years. This is a depositary. Does this open a little? To let a little air in. Hang on, I'll try this one. There we go. Was that wardrobe here? Yes, it was. The wardrobe... the bed... but the cot wasn't here. The cot was always here. Whose bedroom was this? Sergio's. Did you sleep here? The guests slept here. What guests? Whoever came. You slept here as well. We all slept here. Lacho's clothes are in here. It's not Lacho's clothes, it's Sergio's. Please, could you open that a little? Can you open this? We took Lacho's clothes to a charity shop. There we go. Cross ventilation, did you want that? Yeah. Should I ask granny to move us to another one? No conflicts, Ana. No conflicts. It's only a few days. And you know how is Memé. Alright? Move over a little, so we can take these sheets off. You're changing the sheets? I'm changing the sheets because I don't know who used them. Look, there are clean sheets over there. Sergio, Sergio. Sergio, Sergio, Sergio. It's great. Gran! Memé, Memé, Memé... Granny Memé. Let's see. Chanel No 5. How lovely! How did you remember? Because it's your smell. Here's the last one. The last one's for... Anita. Ana, Ana. Ana, Ana, Ana. I don't know if you still like them. What is it? A pendant. I found it in a flea market. Go and get some more coke, Shorty. - No, it's your turn. - No, you go, come on. Go on, fetch it. Can you bring a beer from the freezer too? - How do you do it? - No, no, bring the coke, Shorty. Let me see. You loved that cartoon when you were little, do you remember? Do you want me to take this off and put it on? No, no, thanks. Go on, try it on. See how it looks on you. Let's see. Gorgeous! There are some things that are inherited. Your father was the same when he was little. Every time you came back from a trip you gave us a gift. Real presents were those you gave us. Guilty presents! That's it! You're so mean. It was the only thing that made us happy. Don't start! Don't start, guys. We had to travel. Well, Lacho used to like to run away You didn't go though just to Frankfurt or Guadalajara, Mum. I want to travel too. When you're grown up? No, now. We could travel instead of coming here, couldn't we? Yes. We could go on a big trip. Your father's a homebody, Anita. One thing doesn't stop the other. Yeah, Luisa's right. I went on my trip when I was 15. Are you going to have a party? Don't put ideas in the girl's head. 15th birthday parties are horrible. Plus, they make you use a suit. That's right. Well, everyone partied in those days. But your auntie, always bucking the trend, wanted to travel. Obviously. I find travelling boring. I like being here. Okey, but... What's wrong with that? That's the reason we don't travel? We're all homebodies, my love. Homebodies without a home. You finally decided? You put up the sign. What about you? Did you take charge of the house? Please, let's not start, Mum. Your brother asked me, I answered. I thought we were going to take advantage of all being together... to decide what to do. You had five months to talk about it, to take charge. Now we're going to start showing it. Shorty. It's your mum. Answer it. - Hi Mum. - Alright guys... Let's eat. - Come on, shall we eat? - Let's eat. Let's eat. Come on. Take the glasses. Give me the tray. He's sleeping. Let me move this. Ow, something pricked me. Where should I sit, Gran? There. I sit here. You're here. Emilio here. Ana. Martín. Luisa over there. Very good. Do you want to sit next to Dad? No. Put this over there. Alright. Sit up, Shorty. Didn't you think of a better option? Is this what Dad would've wanted? I don't know what Lacho would have wanted. Your father isn't here anymore and it's time to make decisions. Thanks. The other option is to rent it out for the season. They would ruin the house. What are you on about? If you want to keep it... and reduce the costs, you could divide it into lots. Divide what? The land could be split into lots. Fifty percent for Mum and fifty percent for us three. What are you talking about? If Mum wants to keep the house and lower the costs... Mum could keep the house... and each one of us can do what we want. So you'd also divide Hilda between four? Emilio. I'll take the breast. You always fall so low. Listen carefully. I don't want to keep the house. I don't know if that's clear. It's not a question of money, is it? It's always a question of money. It's not always a question of money. She doesn't want to be in charge of the house. What I mean is that I want to sell the house. Hilda! The pie. Think about it, if we can raise the cost between all of us. Like some kind of family co-operative? Yes. We'd have to think about how we divide the chores. Alejo is a handyman. You could earn some cash. Do you need money, my dear? No, Dad always likes to keep me busy. No one is going to do that for us, much less your son. Alejo has other stuff to do. And if you need money, just ask me. If he needs any, he'll ask me Oh, please! Sergio, I'm talking about investing. Splashing out. Don't you see it's always a question of money? Emilio? Pass me the bowl. Why are you laughing? What are you laughing at? I want to know what you really think. I don't know. I abstain. I don't know what you want to invest. I can't take on anything else with all the kids. The kids aren't to blame for anything. Blame the mothers. I'll do whatever you tell me to do. I can't think about any of this. "I'm a single woman, I can't". You're such an idiot. What's wrong? Fine. I can do it for everyone. Do what? Pay for the house. Are you being serious? Yes. Instead of selling it... What happens if someone comes tomorrow, put the money and it's sold? It gets sold, it gets sold. Is anyone listening to what I'm saying? Please! Why have we all got long faces anyway? Who thinks about this house during the rest of the year? Finally you say something sensible. Ah, Mum! Sit down, Luisa. Can you pass me that? Yes, but sit down. Leave me alone, Emilio. At last, the pie. Who should I serve pie for? - I want some. - Me. For my Anita. For Shorty. Luisa, do you want a little bit? No, no thank you. Fine. It's tasty. Do you want it? No, Luisa, let me do the dishes! It's nothing. Leave that. When everybody's here you don't let me do anything. You smell like a goat. I don't smell like a goat. Excuse me. Is there any water in the fridge? Yes, darling. I just put some in. Here's a clean glass. Thanks, Hilda. Let me open it... you are barefoot. Thanks Let me see if there are any ice. No one fills the ice trays in this house. No, the freezer isn't working. I told the madame. Are you coming to the river? No. It's really intense... it's very hot. Hilda... and you? You're crazy, I've got so much to do! - Come on. - Ok, later. She can't see you. You were like her... when you first came to the countryside. But Madame Memé insists on selling this house. She's just like you. Do you want anything else? No. Your cousin loved it as a child. Alejo used to hide them in the treehouse. Do you like it? It's good. Did you make it? Yes, with lemon, ginger... and a little bit of honey. It's good for digestion. I'll get you a bottle for your personal use. Here you go. Keep it hidden. Shall we go? I'm coming. Go on. Go with the guys. Don't throw it at me. Don't throw it. - Loser. - Stop it. - Don't push it. - You're... No, no, no. Get out of here. No, nothing like mine. No, I think mine is better. That's enough! You're getting me all wet. Ine? Are you Ok? Has he been crying for long? No. Here I am, my poor little thing. It's Ok. Alright, alright. I feel that he understands everything. When I cry or something... Everything that goes through my mind. There you go. Why don't you have a rest? Yeah. Memé tells me not to insist... that I dont' have any milk left. I can't go on. - It's me, it's me. - You scared me! Don't make any noise. Forgive me. I'm sorry. What? What, what? Everyone's around. I can't see anyone. Well, yes, look. Look. There we go, we're alone. Come on. I have to finish Szchetman's translation. Come on, there's time. I'm your boss. Come here. Come on, give me a kiss. Come here. Take it off. Yes, I will. My love. Later, later. I didn't say no. I said later. It's Ok. Later, then. Hold on, slowly. Stop it. No, slowly. Cut it out. You see? You see? Things never go well under pressure. Are you thinking of looking after this house on your own? Yes, why not? You like the house as well. But we could have thought about it together. Keep going. I don't want to interrupt you. It's a cool song, isn't it? Yeah. I don't like rap that much though. Gran told me that you got annoyed. Because we took the annex. We've always slept here. I wasn't aware. If I'd known... I'll swap the flip-flops for the bed. They don't fit me. Which one? Which one's your bed? That one. I'll use it for a few days. Those are my Dad's beers. Yeah, we'll replace them later. Do you want a drink? No, they don't let me. How long are you going to keep listening to them? - In, between... - No, I don't know. Towards, until, to, for, according to, without... - Over, after. - Over, after. Well done. Pretty good for not having gone to school. You didn't go to school? No, I mean you. I went to school. What did they tell you? Nothing, they didn't tell me anything. I learnt the prepositions and then I quit. Did your parents let you? They were resigned to it. Ouch, don't push me! Something pricked me. What were they resigned to? That I wasn't finishing school. They thought I was a "great writer". I wrote a lot, though. Are you a writer now? Careful. No. The truth is I'm not really a writer now. You were very little when I left. We all change. Do you see a change in me? No, but I meant in general. I don't remember you very well. You liked me. Even though you don't admit it. You did a drawing for me of your favourite unicorn. "Come back soon" said the thought bubble. Do you remember that? I don't remember, but I was a fan. - Hold on, come here - I'm getting pricked. Climb on. Come on, I'll carry you. Go on. - Careful. - With what? You'll get pricked. In we go. You stupid kids. Come on, it's just a bit of water. Can you put it to dry? What's that? Put it out to dry. Come on, Ana! Get off! Come on! Stop it. Come here. It's beautiful. Are you angry? Stop it, asshole! Go away, Alejo! Pull a chair over. No, I'm leaving. Could you give me a cigarette? Sure. Are you smoking again? - Yes. - It's the last one. A good reason to go into town. Shall I go with you? No, stay here. I'll bring you some. Martín! Ana? Ana? Take out that shirt, it's all wet. Isn't this dangerous? I'll unplug it in a sec. Take it off, come on. It's getting cold. Here you go. Whose shirt is that? Alejo's. I was cold. I beat you for the first time. Why are you smoking? It doesn't suit you. Are you sure you want to go fishing? Why? I don't know. I was thinking... we could go on a girls' outing. Not now. Tomorrow. Alright. Come here, Shorty. Have a good time! Let me see you. There we are. Off you go. The keys? They're already in. I'm going to buy dessert for tomorrow. - Luisa. - What? I want us to agree, to see things the same way. What's the problem with seeing them differently? We're leaving in half an hour. Have you changed? I've already changed. Go and do it. Are you coming with us, Sergio? Yeah, I'll go later. Aren't you coming to fishing? Yes, I'm coming later. Shall I get in then? - Yeah, get in. What's wrong? Have you changed your mind? Get in. You brought supplies for a whole year. Yeah, over the top! She likes them flashy. Yeah. So do I. I love them "flashy". She wanted them so much, that I got them for her. Hang on. I brought this for you. No... You don't have to bring presents for everyone. Isn't that yours? No, it's yours. Thanks. Are you thinking of staying very long? I just got here and you already want to get rid of me. No. That's not what I meant. Have you moved back, or are you visiting? I don't know yet. It's terrible. Yeah. They were going to asphalt but... I don't know what happened. They left it even worse than before. If we get stuck here... There's nobody to come and get us. Are you afraid of getting stuck? You can call for a tow truck. New year, in a ghost town. We have supplies. It wouldn't be that bad. I could hunt a wild skunk. We could cook it over the car's engine. Uncork a bottle of olive oil. Too much adventure for you, isn't it? What do you know? You always liked being different. To act all mysterious. I mean I don't see you as being very adventurous. Ah, Alejo! I've seen you growing up. You can't make me uncomfortable so easily. That watch... was your grandad's. Yeah... Memé gave it to me. Lacho was really fond of it. It's expensive. If you're going to be hanging out I wouldn't show it off. Are you afraid I'll sell it? Shall I drop you in town or are you getting out before? Wherever you go will be fine. In town. Can you lend me a bit of money? I left without anything. I haven't got any more. That's fine. Thanks, Auntie. Alejo? How will you get back? It's fine. Have you had a bite? Not yet. Maybe they don't like the bait we used. But they'll bite soon. You have to wait. They'll bite in 80,000 years Are there sharks here? No, how could there be sharks? Sharks live in the sea. Turn your phone off, Ana. You'll wake the fishes up. It's not my fault if they don't bite, Dad. Turn it off anyway. No, it's not coffee. It's whisky. You're still hiding it. I still do it by reflex. He's looking better. Yeah, he is. He brought presents for everyone. We're using these days to get to know each other again. I understand if you and Inés have other things... and can't take care of the house. But if you want me to take care of it, tell me... and I'll take care of everything. No, no. Take care of your own stuff. Did you talk to Luisa about the publishing house? What do I have to talk with Luisa about? Nothing, nothing. Tell me. It's nothing. I reminded her the Szchetman translation is overdue. And she asked me for fewer translations from now on. She'll mention it to you soon. Do bonefish have teeth, Dad? Yes, very sharp ones. Do you want to fish? No. You smell nice now. When will they bite, Uncle? Why did you leave the rod, Ana? Do you know when they bite? Yes, I do. Ana? I'll be back soon. Leave her alone. She's over there. Complicated. A complicated time. You thought you could raise your son on your own. Are you kidding? You said you would help me. And we're helping you. What are you talking about? Mum, you're not helping me like this. You're always talking about my breastfeading or not... If I go or not to the office. The house, the publisher? What's happening with you all? What's wrong with the publisher? Where were you? You scared me. Look no further. You're still the most beautiful woman in this house. I stayed in the town for a while. Here you go. Thanks. What about you? Didn't you stay fishing? No, why would I stay? I went to accompany Shorty. Maybe this could be the last photo of the house. Well... It wouldn't exactly be a tragedy. Tell your husband... that he acts as if it was. To be honest you surprised me. I thought you wouldn't come this year. Emilio insisted. I wanted to spend New Year somewhere else. Alone? Why don't you talk to him? I already told you. You must do something. Resolve the publisher's issues. Fine. When the celebrations are over, I'll take care of it. Alright? No, thank you. Ah, Alejo stayed in town. I didn't know if he'd told you? Yeah, he told me. The rascal is behaving himself. What about Ana? Did she come back? No, Ana stayed with Emilio. But she's thinking about something else. Yeah, she's being strange. Does she know? - What? - Does she know? What? That deep down you were always in love with me? You're stupid. No. I say something's odd... because the other night I found her sleepwalking... again. Haven't you got used to this family yet? - What? - That's not it. What is it then? What? Come on, don't act all mysterious. No, nothing. Bye. Go to bed. You got back. Did everyone come back? Come here. Take advantage of Dad not being here. Have a rest for a little while. You're freezing! Stop it, Mum. I'm hot. Turn that off. A bit of money. For you. Thanks. I love you. Aren't you getting in the pool? Your sunglasses are in the car. They don't look good on me. I told you to get the less flashy ones. I like the flashy ones too, Ana. Yesterday's. Thanks. Do you want to hold him? No. He's so small he looks like he would break. You say that because you're still young. But these pups... are stronger than you think. There you go, there you go. There's Mum. Come here, my little boy. My little chicken. Don't cry my baby. Don't cry. Hey. Hey. Who's writing to you so much? Nobody, Mum! Someone from school? That's enough, Mum. It's nobody! I'll go. Aren't you getting in? Later. But I've spoken to Memé to show them the house. Memé is not feeling well. We'll sort it later, I'll call you. Ma'am, kids, next time for sure. Let's do it after New Year. Forgive me. For sure. I'll call back. Try it. That's enough, Mum. Shut up. It's a solution, not a crime! Memé... it was hard with Ana at first as well. You speak to her. She always listens to you. That sounds great, we'll sell the publisher, we'll sell the house. I can't go on any longer. Take a break, that's enough. Seriously. We'll see later but let me have just one peaceful New Year. Young blood at the publisher. Too late, the vegetables go on before the fish. It's the same, we eat them after. Are you cooking or am I? I'll cook them. Push the coals to the back. Move over, move over. I'll take care of it. Very good. Are you still talking about the house? No, we're talking about my sentimental life. I always told him that getting adivorce is antieconomical. Of course. "You mustn't separate, Sergio". "Don't lose the family home". I won't say any more. Yeah, it's better if you don't talk. What's so funny to you? You two, you're funny. What do you think? About what? About Alejo... who is going to join the publisher. A bit of youth. Besides, he can help you, allow you to have more free time. The idea was to become smaller, not bigger. Think a bit before throwing out ideas. Or you think a bit. Yeah. Careful. Keep away from the fire. Mind the sparks. Guys! Smoke. Get out of the smoke, Shorty. Come here, Shorty. Too much smoke for the eyes. Your eyes itch? No, the smoke makes me cry. Look at my frog leg. Is it alright? - Watch out. - What are you doing? Are you going to put it out with that? Getting the smoke out? It's wet. It goes out on its own. Take this. Come here. Take your frog leg. Take this. Do you take it? Do you want me to carry you? Yes. There are loads of prickles. Have you seen the anthills over here? Look, they're huge. Lift your feet up. Alright, lift your feet up. - The dog! - Hey, what are you doing here? Nothing. We're the next-door neighbours. We came because of the smoke. Get out of here! It's private property! We didn't know. We're leaving now. Run, Shorty. Run, run, run. Quiet, quiet. Let's go with the others. Let's go back. Quiet, quiet. Get out. What's wrong, don't you like hide-and-seek? I don't know why I said that to you yesterday but I do remember you. What do you remember? You're still pretty. - Juan Rulfo. - Hop. - Hebe Uhart. - Hop. - Inés Bortagaray. - Hop. - Ariana Harwicz. - Hop. - Cortázar. - Hop. - Natalia Guinzburg - Hop. You fell for it, she's Italian. Natalia Ginzburg, Rome, 1916. Lots of rap, few books. No, what are you doing? Don't throw them into the pram. Stop with the bread, come on. Look how colourful they are. Can you take your feet down as we're eating? Nobody is eating. Can you pass me that? Luisa relax. Hilda is coming Take that paint off before putting the new one on. You can't tell. Put them on top of the shoes? It's horrible. I like it. Stop it. Shall we go into town for a chat? - Alright. - As Ana will be at the bonfire. Ana isn't going to sleep by the bonfire. Why? Because I don't think it's right. What don't you think is right? - Answer me. - Throw it to Ana! Stop it, idiot. No, answer me! I don't want to talk about this here. Come on, Anita. What can you do? Parents make mistakes sometimes. Don't get involved, Mum. Sorry, it's my granddaughter. I'm giving an opinion. Your Dad and I left you free at this age. Ana also has her freedom. What freedom do I have? Well, you can do some things, but others not yet. Of course. I should do what suits you, right? Don't you ever think about what I want? Ana, it's not the place for a family argument. Girls, don't overreact. It's one night. She'd be with her cousins. Don't get involved, Sergio. And you agree. Alright. Do I have to argue here... what are the limits I put on my daughter? With all of you? Well. Let's all leave it. Everyone, Mum! How sensitive everyone is. Idiot! Calm down! Stop it. That's enough! The baby is in the pram! She gets workedup over a little bug. She's freaked out by the bugs. I don't need you to always defend me. Stop it, guys! It's not so serious. Go away! Give it back to me. Don't be silly. Listen to me, Ana. You were sleepwalking again. I found you. The other night, I found you stood naked in front of the lift. That's why I want you to sleep in the house. Do you hear me? I'm looking after you, I'm your mother. I'm concerned. Don't be. It's better to take care of other things. About what? I don't know, your things. Why did we come here? Ana, it was you who insisted. What about you? You wanted to do something else this year! Well... I don't know. We're a family. You sound like Dad. Suddenly, you like to be here. What use is a family if you can't do what you want? Ana. Pick up the clothes. Don't you ever just want to do your own thing? What's wrong? Do you like him now? Who? Get dressed, Ana! You get dressed too. Alright, come on, let's go now... so we can be back early. We can have a drink next to the stream. What if we invite her? The three of us could go. She wants the bonfire... not to town. I know. But we won't lose anything by asking her. What? I'm worried. Aren't you? She's growing up, Luisa. Yeah. But she keeps things to herself. She's quiet. Yeah, she's quiet. What worries you? That she's growing up or that she doesn't tell you? Well, you speak to her then. I'll speak to her. And you stop treating her like a kid. Like a kid? - In front of everyone. - Please. You treat her like a girl. I protect her! You protect her but I don't? So what should I have done? Please everyone? Tell her to do what "madame" said? No. She'll sleep next to you in the bed here, Ok? Do you want to to go out or not? Have you thought what would have happened... if I hadn't woken up at home? That's what we're like. Why can't we go out just one night like a normal couple? Maybe that's not what we are any more. No? What are we like? Are we different, or special? What are we like, Luisa? What do you want us to be, Luisa? Forgive me. I can't believe this. Stop digging all the time. Trying to find whatever the hell we're like. Aren't you going? Ana? Would you like us to go together after the celebrations? Just us two? Whatever you want. Travel? You didn't understand. I wanted the three of us to go. Ana! Ana? Stop, I'm talking to you. Ana! Ask the guys to bring you back, because you're sleeping here. Mum convinced you quickly. It's not for Mum, it's for you. You didn't go camping because you were a sleepwalker? Will you ask them or will I? They're killing me. Ana? Ana. Give me a hand. The pegs are missing. Don't go too far, alright? I'm gathering twigs. Shine it over here. They aren't here. The bonfire doesn't matter anymore. Are you going to stay on your own? I'll sleep with Shorty. - Are you still doing that? - Do you want any fruit? Alright, give me an orange. Help me, come on. I'm going to the car. I'll go with you. It would be better if you go. Don't stay on your own. I'm not scared. It doesn't matter, you go. Look in the boot. Go on. You stood on a poor spider. Found you. "We'll be happy." And their eyes will close to avoid seeing the gestures... in the final shadows. And then you'll feel a scratch on your cheek. A small kiss, like a soft spider, will slide down your neck... The end. I finished it, you can have it. Purple, purple, I see the colour in the air. Keep lifting. Purple, purple, they want me to be nobody. Check if there are stones... Purple, purple, let's keep dancing. The dance of those who resist dancing... although they don't want us to be anybody. Purple, purple, I see the colour in the air. Purple, purple, they want me to be nobody. Purple, purple, let's keep dancing. The dance of those who resist dancing... although they don't want us to be anybody. Because by dancing I understand what's going on... In contrast, false love unravels. If one day you're God, the next you're a cockroach... Half of them stop loving you when you break the spell. I was travelling to the depths of my soul... and when I realised I couldn't get a foothold. I think I floated. Or the pressure was so high, it seems I exploded. It's the last straw, when I look for pears I turn in to sycamore. The more passion, the more I write... I built my own home and in between boxes... Asleep, I breathe, grumble and I look at you and I sweat. Oh my god, obviously, I'm not sober. Give me another sip. Or am I a third leg? How long since we thought about ourselves? Purple, purple, I see the colour in the air. Purple, purple, they want me to be nobody. Purple, purple, let's keep dancing. The dance of those who resist dancing... although they don't want us to be anybody. For Mum, this is a photo. And she keeps it safe. Look at this. - It's incredible. - Does anyone want any more? - Me. - Me. A little bit, yeah. Look at this one. What? Haven't you seen it before? No, but I can imagine it. It's a photo. This is a photo. Did Memé cut off those who ended badly? No. Those who "ended". The exes, the friends who weren't friends anymore. Well, anyone she thought deserved a snip. Look. Are you drinking wine? I'm just licking my lips. Look. He's asleep. And these ones are from New Year. This one's been snipped as well. Who did she cut out? Look at this. That must be me. Don't be paranoid, you're here. Still, I wouldn't be surprised if I was stuck on with tape. No, the ones with tape are only of the mother of my children. Mum had the roll of tape especially for her. Look at this one, please. Hilda was so young! You and Emi are here. And who's this? That was the nanny that Dad found. Do you remember? Graciela, wasn't she? - Graciana. - Graciana! Graciana! Do you remember she was his mistress? Dad's mistress? Our old man consulted her about everything. What did you expect of poor Lacho? He was alone with two little boys. Guys, let's lower our voices. Mum hears everything. It's a strange case of sleepwalking. She hears better when she's asleep. Where was Mum at that time? Mum had gone on a trip... and she decided to stay a few more days... when she had to come back. When Christmas arrived, Graciana was still here. So, I don't understand. We've already drunk two bottles, guys. It's Ok. Days last 48 hours here. Graciana installed at home. Let me tell the story. She had settled in... but at some point Mum decided to turn up unannounced. She came back at Christmas. She handled Christmas like a champion. She came out in the photo, right? In the photo taken by Dad. With Graciana as well? With Graciana. Everyone, with us two looking up. She didn't say anything, but when the photo was developed... out with the scissors and she sent her to Chile again. - Graciana was Chilean. - Yeah, I didn't told you. She was Chilean. I'll take the photo tomorrow. - Are you going to take the photo? - Yeah. No, I'll take it. No, I'll take it. I'll take it. I'll take it. What's the matter? You're not going to take the photo. Why don't you wait and we'll help you? No, relax. You'll be a while. Decapitated, decapitated! Come on, pretty thing. We can share memories and images for a while, can't we? Yes, we can. But let me do what I want. Enjoy the evening. Come on, pretty thing. Don't call me pretty thing. But you're pretty, sister-in-law! Can you give me a cigarette? Thanks. Sneaking out for a cig, are you? Emilio, stop acting like her Dad. Shut up! No, don't get involved! Honestly, don't butt in! "Don't smoke, don't drink", who is butting in now? Stop treating us like kids! Who do you think you are? You couldn't ever cut the umbilical cord with Mum? Shut up, you're an idiot! You're such an idiot! What's wrong? - Nothing. - What's wrong, Ine? No, nothing. What's wrong with you? You're looking for any excuse to align yourself with anyone but me. What are you talking about? That you're stopping translating. I had to find out from Sergio, didn't I? Why don't you tell me? Because Sergio's the one who organises. Yesterday I slipped it out. How strange that your tongue slipped. Well, Luisa was going to tell you, alright? I would have liked to have told you myself. I'm sorry. Sergio has nothing to do with it. I started writing again. I took it up again a few months ago and I gave some things to Sergio to read. That's it. You're the best at translating. Who's going to publish you after 15 years, Luisa? You're such an imbecile. Your father would have. Lacho? Dad, didn't want to sell this house. He wasn't going to sell it, you know? Lacho used to say things to your face, Luisa. Stop, Luisa! Luisa, I'm talking to you. Stop! Enough! Leave me alone! I hate myself when I'm with you! Are you alright? Inés, Inés. Inés? Hang on a minute. Inés? Ine? What happenned? She's still drinking wine! Shut up a bit. Look at the photos, the boxes, there's nothing left! Bring the bin at least! Can you pass a cloth or something? I'll dry it with paper but what about you? I'll dry it as well. Take this memory! There you go, throw that away. One, two, three... four, five... six. Stop it. Stop it. I can't see anything. - Not yet, come on. - No, no, no. Eight, nine... That's enough. Seriously, stop. Ole. Ole, ole... You're getting warmer. Warm. Ole. More cake for you. That's enough. Enough. Ole... I can't see. I can't see anything. But you're an expert at sleepwalking, weirdo. Give it to me. Give it to me. Ole. Almost. Very close. Who was that? Who was that? What are you doing, asshole? Stop pushing me. Hey, asshole. Stop, I dind't touch you. You hurt me, I'm going. Come back, Shorty. No. Come on, Shorty. - No. - Don't be moody, come on. Hey, big asshole. Mind the branch. I can't see, I'm dizzy. Give it to me. Daddy's calling. - He's such a pain. Give it to me. - Yes, he's annoying. I have to go back. I have to go back. I'll take you in an hour. Don't worry. It's alright Guys. I'm going to get Shorty to sleep, alright? Ok. I'll take you later. Don't worry. No, no, no. Come on, a little while. No, no. It's alright, come here. We're enjoying ourselves here. No, no. Get off. It's fine. Hold on. I'll go with you. Get off. Get off. I'll take you later. Get off. No, no. No, Alejo. No, no, no. What's up, Ine? A bottle. Emilio... Where's Ana? Didn't she come back? No, I fell asleep. I told her to come back. She didn't send me any messages. Ana? Ine. Have you seen Ana? No. Has something happened? The kids haven't come back. Don't worry, they probably stayed. She's not answering. I'll go to the bonfire. Ana? Luisa? Sleep. What's going on? Nothing, Memé. Go back to sleep. You're waking up the house. She's not answering. Ana? Ana! Where the hell are they camping? Ana. - There she is. - Ana? - Ana - Where were you? Are you alright? My love. Are you drunk, Ana? Come with us. Let's go to the house. You're freezing! What happened? Everything is fine. Are the boys alright? Go back inside, Mum. Be careful, madame. Alejo. Stay here with the boys, Hilda. Here's your towel. Ana... Did you get drunk? Is that it? Could you leave? Can you leave, Mum? Did someone hurt you? She's all scratched. Where's she scratched? On her legs and arms. She didn't tell me anything. Ask her. I'll ask her. Get out of here. Stop. Stop, Gran. Get out. I'm going to kill you. Alejo! What happened, dear? That's enough, stop it. Come here. Come here. - No, I'm not leaving now. - Alejo Alejo! What's going on? Nothing, Dad. - What happened? - Nothing's going on, Dad. What happened, Alejo? Tell me what happened, Ana's all bruised. I don't know. - What do you mean you don't know? - Let him go.
