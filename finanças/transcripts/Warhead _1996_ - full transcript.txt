[drum] NARRATOR: Long ago in a letter from Germany, DH Lawrence wrote, out of the air comes a feeling of danger. He saw a nation white skinned, elemental, dangerous. Prophetic words then. If he saw the fires this time, would he say, here we go again? [drum] Some extremist groups were banned, but members just joined other groups. And the young still shaved their heads, a symbol of anger and a violent promise. [drum] Nazi skinheads can now be found in most American cities. The best guess is they number only about 3,000, but that's 10 times more than there were two years ago. Klan membership in the South is growing and becoming more extreme. At least 350 people marched in Raleigh in January. [drum] The national Anti-Klan Network says Klan membership in North Carolina has increased 500% since 1979. At least one Klan faction, the Confederate Knights, is set up along paramilitary lines and is believed to be tied to other white supremacist groups. [drum] One week ago at 9:02 in the morning, the lives of those in Oklahoma City were shattered. Many of our neighbors are now dead, some of them children. Of the dead, nine were children under the age of two. Police and paramedics are continuing to search for survivors. We now cross to an earlier broadcast from Senator Brickman in Washington. As chairman of the subcommittee, I think I speak for everyone when I say how deeply outraged we are at the recent bombings of the Internal Revenue officers across the states by Members of the United Patriotic Movement. Patriotic. General-- what's his name? Kraft, and the UPM are nothing more than a bunch of gutless cowards. And I hope you're listening-- [phone ringing] --because if I have my way-- Senator Brickman here. --I'd bring you out of business once and for all. General who? You can be damn sure that my recommendation-- Who? Hold on. --to the president and the joint Chiefs are that we use every available military agency in this country. I'm listening. [music playing] I heard that Senator Brickman was thrown out of office. Well done. MAN: Maybe they'll pay more attention to the United Patriotic Movement. The question is, how will history record this event? [music playing] It's an act of terrorism or like the Boston Tea Party, as an act of freedom by the New Patriots Fighting for the new America. As true Patriots, General. [music playing] BOB [ON RADIO]: You're on the air. WOMAN [ON RADIO]: Hi, Bob. I don't know what we're all so worked up about. The UPM will just disappear like the-- the Black Panthers, the SLA, and all those militant fanatics in the '60s and '70s. BOB [ON RADIO]: Well caller, I don't know what makes you think that. Wake up, people. This is the '90s. The UPM is not just going to go away. And we are talking civil war here. That's right. You heard me, Civil war. The UPM has repeatedly attacked federal targets across the continent with a purpose. The lines are drawn not by the Mason-Dixen, but by economics. OK, you're on the air. MAN [ON RADIO]: Yeah. Ditto on that Bob. It is a war. And I for one am sick and tired of paying taxes just to have them give all our hard earned money to help foreigners raid our country. You know? BOB [ON RADIO]: Absolutely. Now see people, here is a caller with intelligence. And where are we going? Who owns our cities? Get a grip, people. You don't even have to be a citizen to buy a $100 million building in New York, Chicago, or San Francisco. That's right, folks, foreigners. Foreigners. They're buying up America while working class middle America pays all the taxes. You're on the air. MAN [ON RADIO]: Bob? BOB [ON RADIO]: Yeah? MAN [ON RADIO]: I think aliens are behind it. [laughter] BOB [ON RADIO]: What? The, the Mexicans? MAN [ON RADIO]: No, no. Aliens, you know? From the neighboring galaxy? BOB [ON RADIO]: Oh, Christ. You know, it's really hard, people. This is exactly the kind of caller that is why our country is going down the crapper. [music playing] Good Morning, Director. Morning. Hey, Bob. Check. [interposing voices] [interposing voices] Knocking at the door as we speak. [inaudible] WOMAN: Coming up, sir. OK, let's go. BOB [ON RADIO]: And we have got to get back to reality here, OK? Where are all of our hard earned tax dollars going? Well if you're 30 years old, all that money you give each paycheck to social security to support the unemployed, well my friends by the time you retire, social security will be bankrupt. Wake up people. Talk to me, Spotter. Good morning, Lieutenant. And how was breakfast? OK. Viper's Danny is 200 yards. And I see five roaches on the table top. Otherwise, all is quiet, and it's a beautiful day. Craft, he was one of your boys, wasn't he? One of my best. A solution that brought Japan to its knees. We will bring Washington to their's. - Sounds good. - Got it. MAN: What's wrong? I never thought we'd be tracking one of our own. They may have a point. But killing innocent people isn't the answer. Stay alert, PJ. They may have been one of us, but they wouldn't hesitate blowing us away. OK boys and girls, make your mama proud. [music playing] Coming your way, Joyce. CAROL: Sergeant Victoria Palmer. AWOL, 9/28/95, Fort Bragg. Dropped out of the Marines to John Kraft and the United Patriotic Movement. Good-looking girl. That's if you're into S&M. Don't get too excited. Prime suspect, Dallas Federal bombing scene and [inaudible] of Brickman's office. Blast blew him out of a third-story window. Either that or one hell of a sneeze. Wilson, you're sick. Carol, get that over to National Security. Make sure they know it's hands-off. CAROL: Yes. [music playing] WOMAN: Morning. Morning, ma'am. WOMAN: What can I do for you? I got a delivery of dry chemicals here for Mr. Tyrell. Tyrell tell you to bring this here? No ma'am, my boss did. I mean, I just do exactly what I'm told, you know? But if I could just get Mr. Tyrell to sign on the bottom, I'll be on my way. And another. Katie, hi. Yeah, Tannen's not in the office right now. Hello? We're trying to run a country for gods sake. CAROL: I'm sure he'll call you tonight. FBI Director, sir. I'm sorry, Director. He can't talk to you right now. He'll call you as soon as he can. Well that's good enough for me. You men have the authority to move. I wouldn't wait for your self-appointed general to show. Director, we have tracked Lieutenant Kraft for over two years across 25 different states. She makes a strong point, Tom. We've come this far. Why did the fox step out the barnyard? All right, General. You go for your fox. But when Tannen gets back, I want a full report. I'll be at the White House. A very good [inaudible] on the president. Tyrell's busy. I'll sign for him. - No, no, no. My boss is going to have my ass. You know what I mean? I said I'll sign it. [music playing] Kraft's full of crap today. You're telling me. Lieutenant, more than ammunition. Ben suggests active underground passage. Leave your stuff by the shed and be on your way. I'll take care of that right away, ma'am. [music playing] The fuck? Uh. Uh. Uh. Uh. Drop it. - Uh. - Shit. Uh. Ah. Oh, man. Well, there blows breakfasts. The roach is out of the kitchen. Thank you, Lieutenant, to lighting my cooks high up in the air. Well done. Next time, hold the fries. Talk to me, Spotter. Talk to me. I suppose I shall have to entertain them. [inaudible] and drop. Copy that, Lieutenant. Command enemy engaged, going down is the locker rooms. Do you copy? They're sitting on a goddamn hornet's nest. Time to watch the camel hunt. PJ, move it. Uh. Ah. Uh. Ah. Ah. Nice shot, Lieutenant. Difficulty level 2.5. Judge give you a ten. Spotter, going in deep. Assessment. They're going deep. It's got to be that missing munitions shipment from Pendleton last year. Watch your ass out there, Spotter. Towers, we've got a situation here. Where general-- [interposing voices] Get their asses in here. [interposing voices] Come on. Move it. Come on people. Come on. Jones, watch your back. Roach at 9 o'clock. [music playing] Yes. Garcia, cover my ass. Don't touch her ass. It's mine. Pretty ass. [music playing] Come on. PJ, move on. Come on. [music playing] Take cover. - Oh, this is going to be easy. - You've got to be kidding. Ah. Ah. [music playing] Uh. Uh. Uh. Ah. Uh. Uh. - Ah. - Jones? Hey Jones? Where the hell do you think you're going? Uh. Uh. This is no time for recipe swapping. Uh. Uh. SPOTTER: Don't hurt him. You hurt him. Now, that's nice. Hey Jones, how come you never do that to me? I'll see you tonight. [music playing] Ah. [inaudible] Lee? Lee, Allen? I'm sorry. I left the translation book at home. OK? Hey Garcia, far out man. There's a roach at 11 o'clock. No Garcia, not digital, it's a face cloth. That means Mickey's right. He's on the 11 and left hand is on the 12. [inaudible] Let's take them out man. Parks, do them a favor. Take out the two roaches. Shake your ass and move guys. [music playing] Ah. Ah. Ah. Ah. Thank you. [music playing] One, two, three. Do it. Tannen, mother load. Underground mine 5 degrees west back behind the barn. We're sitting on an ammunition dump here. [music playing] [inaudible],, this is the spotter coming to you live. The players are leaving the ballpark. Everything is safe. We'll need IDs. Clearance on the way. ETA One hour. And you can find that, Spotter? SPOTTER: [inaudible] Confirmed. MAN: No ops casualties confirmed. Out. Tell Tannen no heroics. Watch his ass. [music playing] Ah. Uh. Uh. Ah. Uh. Uh. Don't mention it. It's rigged. PJ move. [inaudible] Ah. Oh, fuck. Reducing signal. Get a boost on that now. What in the hell was that? We've lost Tannen. Spotter? Come send me that booster now. Talk to me, Spotter. Could you hang on a second? Please general. Lieutenant Tannen? PJ? Do you copy? Can you hear me? Talk to me. God damn it. Could you hang on a second please General, Sir. Lieutenant Tannen, PJ, talk to me. Talk to me please, guys. Don't leave us now. Come on talk. Talk. Talk. Spotter, tell the old man we're OK. Oh, thank god. Touchdown. OK, Plays, Lieutenant Ted and PJ are OK. Ops command this is Spotter. The men are breathing. Already won, Spotter. Nice work people. Uh. Uh. Uh. Ah. PJ? Uh. Uh. Don't mention it. I won't. I got a bad feeling about this. What the fuck is this place? It's a whole new war. MAN: You expect me to by that? MAN: I can tell that it's not impossible. You can honestly sit there and tell me that this UPM group can walk into a top security missile site and launch a nuclear warhead whenever they damn well please? We are dealing with a highly organized movement, director. And they are dealing with the United States military. UPM is made up of people who are, or were, part of our armed forces. Oh, yeah? Well, I don't buy it. Without proper identification, no one walks in, except somebody like Kraft, who's already had the highest security clearance. Tom, I think you ought to listen to what Tannen has to say. He's on a special assignment to us. Well I don't care who Kraft is or what his clearance was. These are restricted military bases. You give me a three-man team, and I can promise you I'll be inside any secure silo in less than two hours. All we need to launch the warhead are the codes. A lot of Americans are buying this crap about America being sold out. I mean, we just don't know how deep UPM propaganda is penetrated. Some of it makes some sense. If you're a bigot or an out-of-work member of the KKK. Gotta agree, Tom would be more foolish to underestimate UPM's capability. So I guess I'm the one that has to go before the Joint Chiefs and ask for increased silo security. I suggest we change the security codes on all the silos. MAN: Dr. Evans would be right. In the Caribbean on assignment. I'll put a security team on it. I don't like it. This all seems like overkill to me. So is launching a warhead. Call Evans in. Now I know it goes down on the president. COPILOT [ON SPEAKER]: This is your copilot speaking. REGH Andrew's Air Force Base is 2 hours 15 minutes. Should be clear sailing once we reach altitude over the Caribbean. Enjoy your flight. Shift's over. Go on. Get out of here. No. I still got to break down UPN locations for intelligence. It should take a couple hours. Try something different for once. Go on home. Things are kind of rocky at the home front. I mean, the couch isn't quite as comfortable as it used to be. And not committing to this marriage thing, well it's-- Military wives are a special breed, god bless them. You know, mine's as cantankerous as I am. Then I get 30 years, but I wouldn't trade it for anyone. Go on soldier. Go home. Gentlemen, we're experiencing some turbulence as well as an electrical failure. Please extinguish all cigarettes. I'd put the oxygen masks over your mouths. Oh, boy. SOLDIER: Got to be kidding. [music playing] Enjoy your flight. [music playing] They have less altitude here. No mayday call. Could be engine failure. I doubt it. Aircraft control lost contact, General. Last fix was northeast of Haiti. See you there, rescue. They've got nothing. What if it was a hijacking? There was no reason to suspect-- What the hell happened to the security team I put out? Cause that was Dale's call, Jack. You overrode my order? That's enough, Lieutenant. I thought security was my department. Hello? Director? Well, I'm sorry to disturb your party. We have lost the package off Haiti. Tannen's going in. Who should I carry with a Haitian attach , you? Good. Thank you, sir. That will keep it going. On with it, General. Evans is my friend. And If something happens, if there's trouble, you get your ass out of there. You just make sure the locals are friendly this time, OK? [music playing] I got a bad feeling about this. Well that's reassuring. [music playing] Lieutenant Tannen. Go ahead. Let them go, guys. [music playing] Copilot's dead. No sign of the pilot. Holy shit. They've been poisoned. No Doctor Evans. Better take a look at this. It's from Pendleton. Hold it, PJ. Jesus. You just triggered the motion detector. You move that thing, it's gonna blow. Tannen, this is my field of expertise. Now don't pull it. Don't yank it. Just cut the red wire. You got it. Move back. You heard him. Let's move. [music playing] Tannen, I said the red wire. Son of a bitch, Kraft. Tannen, you're a lunatic. Don't mention it. You knew we'd find that cylinder. We got truck marks, sir, half a dozen troops. There it goes. [inaudible], [inaudible] sir. One pair, noncombat. You also knew we'd have to contact ops command before proceeding. So fuck him. If we move, we have no position backup. We got to find Evans before he gets the codes. How far ahead? Engine's to the wall. Half, half, 45 minutes ahead. Tannen, we need authorization. They know our objective. Gentlemen, I'm making a field decision here. We're going in. PJ, go with me on this one. [music playing] We need your jeeps. It's been paid for. [music playing] I got a bad feeling about this. There is no other way across. Don't worry, PJ. This time we're gonna make your mama proud. [music playing] OK, gentlemen, stay alert. Stay alert. [music playing] [inaudible] Do it. Ah. [inaudible] Uh. [music playing] Go, go, go. [music playing] Move, move, move, move move. Uh. [inaudible] [music playing] Get the hell out of here. Move it. Move it. Move it. [music playing] Draw them to the other side. - You got it. - I'm going up. Cover me. [music playing] No. Don't shoot. Uh. Ah. Let's get out of here. Uh. Uh. Ah. Bastards. This is your time now. Touchdown. Ah. Uh. Shit. Uh. Bastard. Bastards. Uh. Ah. Uh. Tannen? Tannen? [music playing] Come on, PJ. Come on, PJ. Come on, buddy. Hold on. Hold on. Tannen? Still a fucking hero. Flush them. Jesus Christ, we're being sucked under. Come on, big guy. That's-- that's too far. Come on, bud. You're gonna make it. You're gonna make it. Come on, bud. No. Pull hard. Uh. God damn it. Come on. Uh. Uh. [music playing] Hold on. Come on, PJ. I can't. I'm going under. I'm going under. [music playing] All right. Move out. Move out. Got a schedule to keep. Uh. No. Ah. [inaudible] Hold on. Ah. Ah. [inaudible] Hold on. Hold on. [music playing] You're the last person in whose arms I want to die. Man, just hold on. OK, man, just hold on. Five more minutes. Maybe I should have sold hot dogs at Wrigley like my old man. Come on. The medic is coming. It's on the way. All I ever wanted to do was make my mama proud. And you're going to. You're going to. Just hold on. PJ? PJ? PJ: Uh. Uh. [music playing] When a career soldier dies in war, everyone remembers the hero. What people don't realize is the war doesn't stop, nor do the heroes. They were more than just soldiers. God dammit. Why didn't you call in? Kraft knew. It was like somebody handed him the flight plan. Impossible. The only people who knew where at ops command. I handpicked my team myself. Now you tell me, how come every time we go after the UPM, Kraft's one step ahead? You have a security breach. I have a soldier whose career is on the line. If that's what it takes to find the truth-- You disobeyed a direct order. Orders? Whose orders? Yours? Lansdale's? The president's? I don't even know where the orders are coming from any more. You weren't there. Damn it, son. Lansdale is looking for a scapegoat. They're calling for a court martial. Technically, I've got to go along with that. Then the hell with it. This isn't about we the people, this is about politics. Don't you see it? Greed, corruption. Guys in $2000 suits. Not like you and me. I mean, patriotism my ass, huh? I've given my whole life to the military. And frankly, I don't know if I need it anymore. Now you sound like Kraft. We were in the academy together, same special forces unit too. Go on home, soldier. You're on suspension. Walk away. That's an order. No one walks. [music playing] What do you want? DR. JESSICA EVANS: What do you mean? Why the hell have you been following me? I wanted to make sure you were clean. Someone said you could help me. Who? Look lady, I got better things to do than play clue. Why don't you just find somebody who gives a damn. Ops command, general Edwards. He worked with my father years ago. And they were both stationed near the eastern block. And who are you? I'm an electronics engineer for defense contractor. You got to be kidding me. MIT. Valedictorian. Don't push it. What's your name? Dr. Jessica Evans. Dr. Evans is my father. Well Dr. Jessica Evans, I'm sorry that I can't help you. We were finishing up an assignment in the Caribbean when he got called by the Pentagon to return for a briefing. It's not like him not to call. I told you Evans, I can't help you. What about the fact that we were involved in developing a prototype that could override any silo's launch command? I'm sure the military can protect its own bases. Not 218. It exists. I was there. It's not on the map by order of the president. 218 was built as a last defense. That's what makes it so vulnerable right now. God damn it. Will You listen to me? If the overrides used to access an ICBM, an enemy can launch a warhead on any US target before our government knew what or who the hell hit it. Tannen's with her. Look, I don't know what Edwards told you. But right now, I'm the last person in the world that could help you out. Edwards told me that you were the only person I could trust. Get the girl. It was before I resigned. Look, if you need help, why don't you go find Edwards? OK? You know what, forget it. Never mind. It's forgotten [music playing] Only one is the overrides, Dr. Evans. Jessica, watch out. Uh. [music playing] Jessica, go get Edwards. [music playing] HOCKEY PLAYER: Back away. Come on. Gather around. Hey. Get off me. What the heck? Hey. Get off me. Let go of me. Come on. Uh. Ah. Hey, hey. Get off. Come on man. Let go. Let go. [inaudible] Shit. Uh. Come on. Let go. Ah. Let go of me. Help me. Get off me. Get off. Help me. Ah. Uh. Dr. Evans, control 24. Engineering-- [music playing] Gate secured, General Kraft. Welcome to silo 218. Load up. Sorry, Lieutenant. I have strict orders not to let you in. Let's get him up on the board right now. General, 218. You know what I'm talking about. Now let me in. You heard me. Now let me in. That was totally unnecessary. I have the authority. I don't have time for authority. General, I think you better see this. Shit. Let Tannen in. Bring him to my office. That's an order. Come on. Let's get ready. Get ready. Break a leg. All secured on top, General. Excellent, Karl. Station the new patriot guard. MAN: Move out. Who am I gonna cover? Right. Move out. Let's go. Let's go. The [inaudible],, I want to place on standby. Director's on his way up. They're patching a call for him now. Listen. [inaudible] is one. Access [inaudible] 218. Gentlemen-- General, buy the book people. [music playing] We're in. [music playing] MAN: We are on the audio channel two. System clear. Alpha, Bravo, Victor, Paul, 471. Alpha, Bravo, Victor, Paul, 471. Priority code's accepted. Accessing. Give me capabilities. That line is clear. MAN: Yes, sir. We get that call yet? WOMAN: Patching through now, sir. Son of a bitch. Access 218, General. [music playing] Clear the second control room. [music playing] We meet again. Looks like our boy found our Achilles heel. OK. Let's get it over with. Listen, this is General Edwards. MAN [ON PHONE]: Go ahead 218. General, long time. I'll tell you, this is not a social call, Major. Straight to business. Its General now. Did you know I'm about to-- Not in my army you're not. What can I do for you? It's very simple you pompous piece of shit. The UPM demand the resignation of the President of the United States. This guy's got to be kidding. The people have grown tired of the Federal Government, of its plundering American resources. Up until 100 years ago, no American ever paid federal taxes. And now our government is in debt for $4 trillion. All of our hard working capital wasted on building up third world countries on the backbone of America's suffering. Our Government vows itself to foreign interests. People we conquered in previous wars now hold the purse strings to our future. I'm not wrong. Think about it. The criminals and the corrupt run this country from the courtrooms to the White House. [music playing] MAN: We authorize flybys every half hour. DR. JESSICA EVANS: Got it. Satellite feed island of the Caribbean, 40 miles east of Haiti. Yeah, priority confirmation. Classified site, 218, two silos, single warhead. Type? Nuclear tipped. That's why there are so many of us fed up in every corner of our society. People who believe it's time to take back America, because it's the only way to stop the lies. Give me liberty or give me death. People who just want America to be American. After the president resigns on national television before the American people, I want $1 billion deposited in an international Swiss bank account. You have 12 hours, or I unleash the unthinkable, one thermonuclear ICBM. You're bluffing. I don't bluff, Director. You have 30 minutes to evacuate US federal property before I send in the marines to wipe the remains off the walls you've buried yourselves in. [dial tone] Damn. Fire missile one. [music playing] Fire it. [music playing] General, SEC reports slow incoming missile. [beeping] Oh my god. He's launching. Destination? [music playing] Code is accepted. [music playing] [beeping] Son of a bitch is going for one of our test sites. What the hell's he done? The unthinkable. [music playing] [beeping] That son of a bitch. Edwards. Dad. You gave him the codes. Oh, I can smell a military craft within 20 miles of this place. I launch the next missile on Washington immediately. [music playing] So I suggest you take the alternative 12 hours then. Clock is run, run, run, run, run, running. [music playing] Oh my god. They're gonna kill him. [music playing] I'll arranged for the money. The son of a bitch is blackmailing the US government. Right, Wilson? Joyce? How much value do you put on the lives of the Capitol, people? That's exactly what he wants you to think. You give him the money, can it guarantee he won't fire a second missile? Director, the president's waiting to see you. I'm on my way. General, I think I know politics a little bit better than you do. Kraft will take the deal. He's in it for the money. And you don't do a damn thing until I return. Is that understood, General? Is that understood, General? Loud and clear, sir. Good. Pompous little shit. God. I'm assembling a team and I'm going in. And I'm taking her with me. DR. JESSICA EVANS: What? They're hardly going anywhere, son. You do know the ramifications if he launches another warhead? Wait a minute. No, you wait a minute. You've got the overrides. And they've got your father. He could still be alive. Jessica, out. Jack, I cannot endorse this. You're still under suspension damn it. I'm going in with or without your approval. Watch your ass, soldier. [music playing] You may have jeopardized the entire future of our country. I'm prepared to face the charges, Lansdale. Charges? [laughter] Mister, you just made the biggest political blunder of your career. Wilson, patch me through to 218. What are you doing? Wilson? Sir? 218, sir. Patching through line six. General Kraft, this is Director of Special Ops Thomas Lansdale. We have reason to believe that there's a small strike force that's taking matters into their own hands. They should be on their way to you now. Are you out of your mind? You just compromised my operatives, Wilson. So Tom, the old fart went behind your back and sent in a team. What did you expect? I have word from the president that he's placing a sum of $25 million into your Swiss account at this very moment. He also guarantees you and your men safe passage if you abandon the silo. Safe passage? Sounds more like trying to buy me out. Well I hope you'll come to your senses, General, and find these terms amenable. Think I'm a fucking idiot, Lansdale? You moronic political jackass. It's over, Kraft. Take the offer. It's more than anyone expected to get. I'm not one of your constituents, Tom. You underestimate the power and the goals of the UPM. But right now, I got to run. I got to get the place ready for some unexpected guests. I'll get back to you. [dial tone] Kraft. [music playing] He'll call back. Karl? KARL: Standing by, General. When my guests arrive, you cook them for the main entree. [music playing] Ah. Oh, no. Uh. We have one scout down. Dr. Evans, you might need this. All right, deploy! [music playing] Lady, give me the grenade. I've got to take them out. Get your grenade, baby. Lieutenant, good luck. Ready grenade, baby? Yeah. [music playing] Karl, come in. Karl? Shit. Ah. Uh. [music playing] Come on, lady. Move it. [music playing] MAN: They knew we were coming. They did. There's nothing we can do about it now. We got a long way to move. Let's go. MAN: Cut off communication with ops command. Why in the fuck didn't you finish them? Yo. What's up doc? So what do we do now? Surrender or retire? We launch the second missile. Good answer. Seen Lansdale? No, sir. Anything coming in? Nope. Nothing. Why is nothing happening, Eddy? You tell me, sir. Go tap all calls to 218, incoming and outgoing, all bands including cellular. OK? It'll take some time, sir. Do it, son. [music playing] [inaudible] Ready? Go. Go. Go. Ah. Uh. MAN: Move it. Move it. Move it. We can get to the control room from here. You got about two seconds, lady. Come on. Move it. Damn it. - How's that? Did you really think that you'd become Secretary of Defense? LANSDALE [ON PHONE]: I'm being nominated when this is over, Kraft. But don't worry, I am going to take care of you. You can start a whole new organization in Mexico, or the Honduras, Belize, or wherever you want. Who cares? It's all been arranged. Believe me. You and I are going to make millions. We? Bullshit. This isn't about money. I am the one risking everything for this cause. Cause? There is no cause you egomaniac. We have a deal, Kraft. If you do anything, I swear to God I'll kill you myself. [music playing] Uh. JOYCE: General, incoming. Your boy is so predictable, like his mentor. No less predictable than you, Kraft. So where is Lansdale now, huh? Oh, he's probably on his way to Switzerland by now, as arranged. [yodeling] Well I guess this is goodbye, General. I have my principles, you son of a bitch. Why won't you listen to me? In 30 minutes, Washington will be-- will be a memory unless my demands are met. I hope ground zero is all it's made out to be. You heard him kids, 30 minutes, go. Joyce, get me the president. - Yes, sir. Colonel, at command. Yes, Mike, standing by. --in the Caribbean. Come on, soldier. Which way? [music playing] [beeping] Get her to the elevator now. [music playing] Shit. [music playing] Shit. Ah. Ah uh. Ah. Uh. Uh. Uh. Ah. Uh. Ah. - Uh. - Uh. Uh. Uh. Uh. Ah uh. Uh. Uh. Uh. Uh. [music playing] Uh. Ah. Get to the control room. I'll cover you. Go. Go. [music playing] Ah. Ah. Uh. Ah. Uh. Uh. Uh. Uh. Uh. Uh. Uh. Uh. Uh. [music playing] Uh. [music playing] Come on. Come on. Shit. Yes. - Uh. - Where is she? She's up in the control room. Meet us at the second level exit. - I'm going with you. - No, you're not. You're not good on that leg. That's an order, soldier. [music playing] Come on. Dad, no. That's-- that's impossible. Nobody knows the code but-- Is there a problem, doctor? Oh, no, no, no, not at all. Dad. What are you doing? Uh. Ah. Ah. Ah. Uh. No. Come on, Jessica. Come on. Come on. That's it. Yes.

You have to override it from your-- uh. [music playing] Sorry, Jessica. Dad? No. Dad? No. Dad? [music playing] Hey, Kraft. Hey, buddy. It shouldn't have to end this way. The system can change, but not your way. Always the optimist. Of all the men I served with, I thought you would understand. That's exactly why I'm not going to let you get away with this. - Why? Because you're part of the cancer too? No. Because I'm willing to find the answer not by pulling the trigger, because that's a coward's way out. Then we go together. Come on. Make your mama proud. Uh. Uh. Uh. Uh. WOMAN: [inaudible] 10 minutes and counting. Shit. I gotta do something. They've activated the self-destruct codes.

North, the silo, Tannen's inside. Uh. Uh. Uh. Come on. Come on. [music playing] Uh. Uh. Ah. Uh. Uh. - Uh. Uh. Go. Secure it. Hurry. Get the rope. Hurry. [music playing] Ah. Uh. Uh. Uh. Uh. Ah. Ah.

[cheering] [music playing] That son of a bitch. Uh. [music playing] We're still on suspension. I figured as much. I think I'll take my wife to Hawaii, 30th anniversary. That'll be nice. For you. What's this? Virgin Islands. Debrief Jessica. She's going to need a lot of debriefing. Oh, Wilson's been bumped upstairs to joint affairs. I'm now her boss as well. You mess with her, you answer to me. All right, soldier? Wouldn't have it any other way. [music playing] Hey boss? Thanks. [music playing]
