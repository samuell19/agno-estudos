Charlie's and Slovak Television Bratislava present. Produced by: A Martin Sulik film. EVERYTHING I LIKE Starring: Story and screenplay by: Script Editor: SUNRISE THE FAST Open up! Open the door! - What do you want? - I want to fuck you. - Don't worry! - No! Get out! I want a kiss! Let me in! Get out or I'll call the police! I'll fuck you then. Get out! I'll call the police! - Open up! - Get the hell out of here! Maybe rain, maybe snow, maybe baby, maybe no! - Don't touch me! - Shut up! No! Get out! Open your legs! Don't fight me! Get off! Open now! I'll break the door down now! If you wanna fuck me, you'd better learn better English! Fucking English! I am Slovak! Unfortunately. I wasn't expecting you. The lesson isn't till tomorrow. I thought we could practise a little. You know I'm not very good in it. I have to go to school in a while. I'm teaching. What are you teaching? Ninth lesson. Cold welcome. I don't want it. I told you I don't want it. Here. - What is it? - It's an application form. You should fill it in as soon as you can and send it off to London. Please outline the aims you have regarding your work career and how you plan to achieve them. Do you think I should fill it in? Well, you wanted to go abroad, didn't you? If nothing else, you can learn English. How long is it for? I don't know. Maybe a year... Maybe longer. You decide. What do you want to do here? How can you stay in one place all the time? It would drive me nuts. By the end of the month I'll be on my way back home. Maybe you'll come with me. Are you afraid of change or what? Stop eating when I'm talking to you! I don't have to eat at all. I'm serious. Me, too. I could fast for 40 days if I wanted to. I'd purify my blood, renew all my cells. I'd be a new man. I don't understand. Buy a new hair dryer. PAINTING IN THE OPEN THE SON Hi, dad. - Why aren't you practising? - I just did. What exactly? I'm preparing for the entrance exam. Set pieces! - Then play them for me one more time. - OK. Are you kidding me? Is this in the piece? Yes. But I'm playing it backwards! I feel sick. Stop the car. I can't stop here. Wait a minute. Wipe your face. 1, 2... It's March 27th, night time. Shit! I'm such a stupid dick! Fucking life! Stop please! Andrej, are you all right? What's wrong? Open the door! Don't you hear me? Say something! Why did you lock the door? - Give me the shirt. - Leave it alone. Come on, give it to me! You should've stopped. No need to be embarrassed. Sometimes I feel like puking, too. LANDSCAPE WITH A BALLOON THE MATCH WOMAN I've been waiting for you for two hours. Where's all my stuff? I gave you everything. I've got nothing left. It took me half a year to pull myself together. And now you come... You just robbed me! Should I call the police? Call them. As you wish. You're crazy. You even took my phone? I did. So what? - Why are you doing this? - Do you have to ask? Everything was left on my shoulders after the divorce. The big flat, my crazy mother, the boy, and you just packed your suitcase and left. I slave and you just show off with that perverted American bitch. She's English. What's she like? Well? Is she red-headed? You're an irresponsible bastard! I'm glad I got rid of you. And don't worry. I'll do everything to make you suffer too. You even took my tapes. All my recordings. So what? You never used them anyway. If you had at least transcribed and published them. Then give me my typewriter back. Aren't you ashamed to beg? Should I lose all my respect for you? How did you manage to move it all out? I hired a removals firm. Everything's left to me. I think I'll get married. - Who to? Vasek? It doesn't matter. He's not like you and that's what counts. Do you love him? I don't know. He's strange. We go out biking. He's always buying me things. Recently he gave me a toothpaste economiser. He's never hit me. Could you really not live with me? I'm sick. I must have eaten something. Turn round. If you want, you can stop by for your stuff. THE WORLD ACCORDING TO HEGEL (AN INTERVIEW WITH THE WRITER) According to Hegel antithesis rules the world. In the beginning, the world broke up into antitheses. That's what drives this world. In the biological world the antithesis is transposed into male - female. I wrote an essay about it: Man and Woman Relations as the Basic Antithesis in the Novel. Their rivalry in marriage or in a longer relationship consists of their vain struggle to understand each other. What is important is that people love games. If it were easy, and they got together right away, it would be boring, right? When a man conquers a woman, or vice versa, it's just a game. There are these Casanova types who aren't happy when they can't conquer the woman. I think it's deeply rooted in every man. That's why we don't like prostitutes. Because it's not natural. She can be beautiful and rich. I mean the prostitute. But there's something strange in that you don't have to conquer her. To give her money is no conquest. The man must show some quality within him like a dog - he has to exhibit his strength or his intellect I know from my own experience that, as soon as a woman comes to my place, I behave differently. I've noticed it. Young people don't realise that. It's quite strange that soldiers can sit in a cafe and be terribly bored. But once a woman passes by then suddenly they talk about her. They talk about their experiences, about their affairs with women. They don't talk directly about the act of making love, but about how they conquered the woman. Literature describes the lengths to which men go in conquering women. Is it still on? No. Done! THE FATHER Call room 13 for me please. No one's answering. But the key's not here. Thank you. - What do you want? - I'm looking for my dad. I'll open the door for you. Hi, dad. How did you find me? Mum called to say you were here. I went to the hospital yesterday. Why didn't you stay with me? I didn't want to bother you. I don't like to stay at your place. And who's this? I don't know. She sold me a vacuum cleaner. She drank all that. She was crying up to 4 a.m. I didn't understand her. She doesn't speak a word of Slovak. Is she Romanian? Who knows. Bucharest? Yerevan? I told you I'm totally at a loss with her. Have something to eat. I'm not eating. - What do you mean? - I'm just not eating. - At all? - At all. How are you living? Do you want to destroy yourself? Varazhdin? Here you are. Buy yourself some clothes! Poor thing. There's real misery in Romania. That's why they come here. I'd pay three times as much for it here. Great suction, right? You see? It picks up every speck. And what did the doctor say? The doctors are at loss. They examined me all day long. I can't even work. I start panting right away. I come out in a cold sweat and that's it. Recently, I wanted to mow the lawn but I wasn't able to. I shouldn't have come here. Where are you working now? Nowhere. - What do you live on? - On the dole and so on. I'd love to kick your ass. And how is little Andrej? He's not little anymore. - Do you see him? - From time to time. Sometimes we listen to the tape he sent us. To the... concerts. He plays well. When are you going to stop by? I don't know. He's quite busy at school. He's preparing for the entry exams. To the conservatoire. Tell him I was here. Look, she's got nice tits. You like them, don't you? - Shall I help you? - Not necessary. - Let me help you. - Let it be! Don't be silly. - Let me take it, dad! - Leave me alone! Don't touch it! I told you not to touch it. I'd better have died at home than come here. I stay in a lousy hotel because I'm ashamed to go to you. But dad... You haven't got a job! You left your wife! You don't care about your son! What kind of person are you? Your bus leaves in a minute. Can you lend me 80 crowns? For the ticket. THE SLEEP And maybe our listeners might be interested in an authentic recording of Andy Warhol's mother singing in Ruthenian dialect. Fasting liberates the soul from the domination of the body, it's a protest against today's hedonistic lifestyle. It's an education for a higher life, it rids you of all bad habits, it boosts the mind and helps virtues grow. SOMETHING FROM JOYCE What is there to see? A naked chick. Come on in! Nice pussy. Don't talk like that. And how else can you say it? I bought you a new suit. Mum wants you to take dancing lessons. Why? Why? You'll stop thinking about bullshit. They'll teach you how to treat women. In a decent way. Is that necessary? What do you actually enjoy? Do you really think that there's nothing more interesting than a naked... Just say it! You see, there is no other way to say it. Come on. Come into the water. I don't want to. Stop it! Take your clothes off and come in! I don't want to. Spoilsport! Row a bit. Don't take a picture of me! I don't have any of you. Do I have to row? No, but at least smile a bit. And grab hold of the oar! I really want to get the picture right. I want you to look good. Put your back into it! More! Smile! You happy now? My father drove me to school that day. It was raining and his hair was wet and pasted over his forehead. It was long, it was down to his shoulders. He didn't do anything, didn't say anything... And I never saw him again. All he left behind was one of those machines for rolling cigarettes. My mother started to stuff herself. She fed herself to madness. You know, she looked like one of those big double basses. Then she got thin again, but no man ever looked at her again. And then she joined the nutty feminists and now she roams around the city plastering those insane posters on telephone boxes. It's terrible. When I get home, we have a few beers together and talk for a while... Then after a few days we start getting on each other's nerves. And I have to pack my bags and leave again. You don't have to do anything. Nothing will help you, save your breath, just take your trousers off and show your naked bum. - What's this about? - It's James Joyce. That's no excuse. You just made it up. You're a pervert. You idiot! Now tell me something nice. There is lightning over the Tatras, thunderclaps beat wildly. Let us stop them, brothers, for all that, they will disappear, the Slovaks will revive. Will you try it out? Not necessary, it's fine. Maybe something needs to be shortened. Take your clothes off. I don't want to take dancing lessons. Those movements are funny... What's funny about them? Every normal person dances. Give it a try. Can you waltz? One-two-three, two-two-three... What? Look at my feet. Dad, let me go. Well, do you know it now? Put this on. Get up. Here you are! Which side do you keep it on? - What? - Your willy. I don't know. Maybe on the left. I'll leave it loose here. Okay? A PICTURE OF THE OLD WORLD You dirty bastards! You've ruined my life! Filthy swine. Sodom and Gomorrah on you, 'cos all you do is fornicate. All sins are falling upon me, you dirty bastards! They've robbed me of everything! You're obscene. All of you fornicate, but what about your souls? Your souls cry out. You are shameless! But the Lord sees everything and he will punish you for your fornication. You deceitful thieves! What in your view is the most important thing in life? Heinous bastards! I've got nothing to eat! And you just fornicate like dirty, dirty bastards. Abomination all around and stinking ordure! Shame to live here! THE CATHOLIC Hello? Shut up! Some wine? Come on, you guys. You're not drinking enough. Have some more wine. Can I have it now? - What happened? - Nothing. Is that the American? She's English. I know. Did she invite you too? Shush. What's up, Magda? You want to leave with her? Who told you that? Aren't you ashamed? Are you a catholic? What do you want to get yourself into again? Wasn't one marriage enough? How are you going to survive there, you goody-two-shoes? - Does she understand Slovak? - A bit. Listen, my dear, do you like this “kokot”? It's impossible to be with him. I had to divorce him too. What does it mean, "kokot"? It has several meanings. But she wanted to say that I'm a miserable wretch. I see. JOURNEY TO THE CENTRE OF EUROPE Why didn't you come? I sat all alone for three days in that stupid rented apartment. You should have stuck your head in the oven and turned the gas on. Nothing belongs to me there. I need to have my own things around me. I need to have my own wardrobe, my own bed, my own books I need to be able to hang things on my walls. I tried to call my mother but, of course, I couldn't get a line. So I ended up getting drunk instead. Then I felt even worse. I don't understand it. I feel good here, but I can't stand it here anymore. I missed you. You must leave with me. Must I? Well now, better? This'll help you. Ann? Where are you? What's happened? What's your name? I don't understand you. What's your name? What am I to do with you! Listen: This is the centre of Europe, my dear! THE WEDDING ANNIVERSARY What's wrong with you? I can't even kill any more. What shall I get you to eat now? Good that you came. Father's not well. He's gone mad. C-sharp. A-sharp. Tighten it properly. How can you tell? I'm stone deaf. But I like it when you play. - Is that enough? - Yes. I'll be free in a few minutes. You'll see. I'd like to see that. - Isn't it too tight? - Don't worry. - Ready? - Go on! Just pull! Higher! A little bit more. Don't be afraid! What's wrong with you, dad? Mum's not well and you're playing the fool. Let it go! Untie me. You're a dick. Such a poor devil. A wretch. Lord, bless these gifts that we are about to accept from your generosity. Lord, be our guest. I'm not going to eat, mum. Why? It's good. I don't want to. I don't eat any longer. Don't beg him. Don't give it to her either. It's meat soup and she's a vegetarian. Take the fatty meat out. You know he doesn't like it. I'm sorry! That's okay. He doesn't like soup anyway. Go and get changed. We'll wash it at home. I’ll help him. How much do you want? - What's the matter? - I've got no appetite. I'm not going to eat either. It's cold and tasteless. Go and apologise to your mother. Me? Why me? Why did you bring that woman here? Just to insult us? Mum's not well. She's gone mad. I thought about buying a trip to Austria. They have Vienna, and that Stephen's Church... But she's not interested in anything. I'm at the end of my tether. When I want to help her, it's wrong, when I take no notice of her, it's even worse. She's wasting away completely. What have you got going with the brunette? Do you sleep with her? She told me you want to leave with her. Do you know what else she told me? That I'm a dick. Are you serious? Who's going to eat it all? At least give it a try. You don't have to eat. Just put it on your tongue. PHOTOGRAPHING THE DWELLERS OF A HOUSE Has it clicked yet? Not yet. It must have. I'm going to have a look at it. Wait! Don't move now! STRANGELY GRACEFUL What are you doing here? I brought your stuff back. I wanted to make you happy. Now? When I'm leaving? Hail, Mary, full of grace, you received the angel's message... What do you want from me now? I need 20,000 crowns. What for? Vasek and I want to move to a new flat. But you know I've no job. You've got something set aside. How do you know? Is this the first time we've met? You've already made me happy, SO how you can leave. I thought you'd help me. After all I've been through with you, I think I have the right to live like a decent human being, no? Magda! That's Vasek. Does he know you're here? Magda, are you there? Go and tell him I'm not here. I don't want to see him now. I'll hide somewhere. - Good evening. - Who are you looking for? Is Magda here? No. What would she be doing here? - I know she's here. - She really isn't here. Well then, I'm sorry. Excuse me, may I take a look? Get dressed and come home. Leave me alone! I tell you: Come home! Let me be! I don't understand you, Magda. And you, sir, are a liar. Don't be mad, but he's a pain in the ass. He checks up on me all the time, he won't let me breathe. He's as jealous as a cat. Let him suffer a bit now. He loves you and you treat him like a piece of shit. He's really good-hearted but... Andrej doesn't like him and I'm afraid they'll never get on with each other. That boy pines for you. I don't know what to do. I'm arranging for you two to be constantly together. What?! I want the court to give you custody. But the court clerks are totally cold-hearted beasts. They don't understand that a boy needs his father. You just want to get rid of him. No. I just need some time to pull myself together. I'm sick again. Magda, are you expecting a child with him? THOREAU, KANT, GOETHE AND OTHERS (AN INTERVIEW WITH THE WRITER) I'm not the only one who doesn't travel, and considers travelling pointless, even obnoxious. The American philosopher, Thoreau, accepted neither telephone nor telegraph. He thought all of those things were senseless. Or Kant who sat all his life long in one small town, now called Kaliningrad... He was also indolent. I read somewhere that when Goethe was old he regretted that he'd ever wasted his time somewhere in Italy. Also, other people who travel to experience something are often disappointed. They claim that they didn't appreciate it, that there were crowds in the Louvre and they didn't see what they came for. Or it was empty and they didn't like that either. Travelling itself doesn't necessarily enhance our knowledge of the Earth, of the world, and it is quite tedious too. Sometimes I feel like travelling. I often dream that I'm in New York, that I'm spending the last of my money on a fine and I can't travel on. I can't even call anyone. I usually have interesting dreams. That I am for instance at Tolstoy's in Russia, I'm looking at exhibits, because I saw them at an exhibition. And I feel that I'm in Russia, far away. Muddled-up dreams I'll make you another soda. Come on, Ann... Let me go. You son of a bitch! I hate you! You must come with me! THE GENERAL END OF FASTING Why are you going by ship? I want to see the town for the last time. You could always run along the bank and wave to me. I thought you'd drop by yesterday. What for? To pack your suitcases? No! What time do you arrive in Vienna? I don't know. I've got plenty of time. I don't fly to London until tonight. You know, I could stay here up to the evening and you could drive me to the airport. I won't. You'd better go. Right away. What's the matter? Nothing. The bill please... Here you are. I'll have two more sandwiches. One with ham and one with caviar. - To take away? - No. Thanks. Eat! Eat! Don't be so stubborn! I can't stand you when you're hungry! Eat! What's your name? I don't understand! What do you want? Don't speak to me in English! I'm stupid. You taught me nothing. Really? Fuck me. Stop! Leave me alone! Get away from me! Don't come near me! WHAT DO YOU WANT? PLAY ME SOME MUSIC What did you have to do there? We played. A set piece in the first round. And in the second? - Nothing. They kicked me out. - I know that. But I don't understand what you botched up. How many kids were there? - Were they better? - I don't know. What will you tell your mum now? She doesn't care if I study at the conservatoire. Did you do it on purpose? Where will you go now? You've fiddled for days and what now? I thought that at least music is important to you. - What did you botch up? - How can I explain it to you? Take it out. Play me some music. - What? - Whatever. Do you know this? Play it! Well, what's up? Are you deaf? Don't you have a musical ear or what? - Is that in major or minor? - How should I know? Can't you pick up a simple tune? Have you gone totally daft? Well, play it. What's that supposed to be? Are you kidding me? Don't play what I'm singing, I don't have a musical ear. Play what's in my head. What I hear here. You know what I mean. The record in the black sleeve, with the scratch. The one that skips in the chorus. Don't you know? That's the song I mean...
