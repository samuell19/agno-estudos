THE TROLL PEAKS ROMSDALEN Ah! Hey Tiny, are you coming? Or you gonna hang there all day? I'd worry about yourself, you old fossil. The Troll Peaks. Do you remember the fairy tale? Papa. Come on. I still don't believe in fairy tales. That one was your favorite. Hmm? Once upon a time, at a big troll wedding, 13 drunk trolls lost track of time, the sun rose and turned them to stone, and now they're mountains. Blah-blah-blah. You do know that... there's some truth to every fairy tale. They're just mountain peaks. You have to see it to believe it. That's what they say. It's the opposite. You have to believe in something to see it. Can you see them, Nora? Go on, try. Look. Not with your eyes. With your heart. Believe. Made of earth and stones. With a snow-clad heart. And icy bones. From darkness they came, and died in the light. 20 YEARS LATER THE ATLANTIC COAST NORTHWESTERN NORWAY I understand that, sir, but I can assure you, we are working around the clock. The whole team is, uh... What was that, sir? I can't hear you, the reception out here is, uh... Sir? Hello? Hello? There's, there's... There's wind and... Schmuck. Has anyone seen our fearless dino hunter? She just started a new dig, Secord. - Another one? - Mm-hmm. Over there. Of course. You plan to dig up the entire beach, Nora? Uh-oh. I don't like that look. I just got off the phone with the university. Ah, fuck. Look. We've been up and down this coast for what, six months now? - Nothing to show for it. - But we just need a little more time. Nora. Please. We're so close. I can feel it. I'm running out of excuses. All right? And without financing... Hell no. Screw the financing. What are you doing? If there was one thing my father ever taught me, it was to never, ever... ...ever lose... faith. Ha! You're shitting me, right? Get your ass down here, Secord. We've got something! Nora, we got something, right? Yes! My God! Would you look at that? From a time of giants. Just like a... like a fairy tale. This is no fairy tale. Look at you! Hi, beautiful. HJERKINN DOVRE MOUNTAINS WE ARE BUILDING THE DOVRE RAILWAY Let the mountain live! Let the mountain live! TO HELL THROUGH A TUNNEL Let the mountain live! Let the mountain live! Bring in the explosives. Everyone, out! Let the mountain live! Boo! Okay, let's get to work! - Okay. - Let's go, guys! Huh? Everybody out! Get out! Now! NORWEGIAN ARMED FORCES OPERATIONAL HEADQUARTERS, AKERSHUS FORTRESS, OSLO I'm getting a message about high seismic activity in Dovre. Where's Sigrid? Requesting to send a reconnaissance aircraft to Dovre Mountain. Did I miss something? ØRLAND AIR BASE TRØNDELAG Raven 4, standing by. Raven 4, clear for takeoff. HQ, this is Raven 4, approaching Dovre. Officer on deck, ten-hut. General. As you were. HQ, are you seeing this? - What? - We have visual here for you, sir. Alert the Prime Minister. THE PRIME MINISTER'S RESIDENCE OSLO - Good Morning. - Good Morning. - Prime Minister. - How very formal of you, Andreas. The Minister of Defense will brief you on the way. The only intel we have is from the recon aircraft, which has produced these images here. Oh my God. It looks like it could be a meteor crater. The crew is on its way now to assess the situation. Has word of this gotten out? I have the media under control. Oh, Is that so? There's one more thing. The planes took images of the area nearby. As of now, we haven't been able to confirm that the imprints in the landscape are directly related to the incident. But, uh, we're working on it. Thanks, Fred. What the heck is that? Huh? They almost look like footprints. Right? I... I guess I shouldn't have said anything. I'm not qualified. That's right, yeah. But we need to find someone who is. Geologists. Archaeologists. Biologists. Yeah. Ologists. - Congratulations. - Thank you. - Speech! Speech! - Yes! Speech! Speech! Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'll do it. Okay. Uh, "impossible", they said. Absurd. They even called us mad. - Oh, you are mad! - Yes. Just a little bit. But I think this proves that if you really have faith in something... What the hell? Tidemann? Nora Tidemann? I'm here to escort you to Oslo immediately. - Huh? - It's a matter of our national security. Nora Tidemann? Yeah. Andreas Isaksen, advisor to Prime Minister Moberg. You guys know that I dig up fossils, right? I don't mean to be so mysterious. - But this really is top secret. - Top secret. So I've been told. You'll get more information very soon. Yeah, I heard that too. You could've just called me. Once you see, I think you'll understand why. They don't include this area in the guided tour. - Star Trek? - Sigrid and I have an ongoing thing. - That sounded bad, not like that. - Dude! You've dragged me out here from a project I spent years financing and planning. Yeah? I didn't eat anything and I'm exhausted, which is a really awful combination. - I'm in the dark... - The reports we received have indicated... ...and I'm not getting one damn answer... Hi. This is Nora Tidemann. She's a professor of Paleontology. Paleontology? Really? Dinosaurs? That's right. I study fossils. Hmm. Dinosaurs have been extinct for 65 million years, so... Yes. Well, I guess we can cross dinosaurs off, then. Yes. Continue, Lunde. First of all, I have to be clear that at this moment we cannot say with certainty that this was not a military attack or act of terrorism. But the reports so far indicate that the incident at Dovre is geological in nature. In addition to the crater in the mountainside, a series of indentations were discovered in the landscape. - Could it be a Karst? - Excuse me? Sinkholes. Water seeps through the mountain's porous crevices, which dissolves calcium sediments beneath the ground. This creates underground caverns, which ultimately collapse. But it could also be the accumulation of large subterranean pockets of gas. Methane? Yes, another consequence of global warming. Yes, well, I guess we better call Greta. The demolition work could perhaps have caused a chain of explosions which... Sorry. Sorry. Are you joking? - Excuse me? - Are you joking? Hello? I can assure you, miss, that this is deadly serious. Mm... Okay. But... Everyone sees they're footprints, right? Look at them. Footprints. Is there a... specific type of monster the paleontologist had in mind? Well, uh, it makes no sense considering the deepest footprints... We have something. A protester got footage of the incident with a cell phone camera. It wasn't easy hacking the cell phone remotely. It was nearly impossible, between you and me. Then I found a back door. Had to dig a little. Um, long story short, bingo! Let the mountain live! Let the mountain live! Let the mountain live! Let the mountain... Oh God. Run, go! Get back! - Could that be methane? - It very well could be, yes. After years... - The explosion emanates from the same... - Hey. Sigrid? Can... Is it possible to, uh, go back a little... in the film? Right there, if you can. - Start from there. - Let the mountain live... That sound, it's like some kind of... animal. Stop. The road past Dovre is temporarily closed due to construction work on the new express railway. The road will be reopened soon, according to government officials. - I wonder what's gotten into Solo? - Hm. He's losing his mind out there. Huh. Ah, well. Huh? Dear God! Honey? Get in the basement! Hurry. Oh! Ah! Are you claiming it's a hominid? Give me a break. - Morphologically... See those footprints? - That is enough. You have to start using language that everyone can understand! As far as I can see, we have two legs, right? And two arms. So what you're proposing here is that it's a giant chimp? King Kong. Perhaps? The largest primates on earth are only... ten to thirteen feet. According to what we know. This thing... seems to be over a hundred and fifty feet tall. That would be unnatural. Or supernatural. And is there nothing else you've found? Our searches haven't found further evidence. What plans do you have? Are we gonna sit on our asses discussing theories, or are we gonna take action? Miss, please, restrain yourself. Professor Tidemann, thank you. I can put my work on hold for the time being. To help out with the efforts in Dovre. But talking about gas pockets with Professor Sinkhole is really not for me. Nora Tidemann. The Prime Minister has made you a Scientific Adviser. There's been an incident in Lesja. - We need to go there immediately. - "We"? Oh. Yes, I've been assigned to escort you there. Uh, so what was, uh... What was the reason you started digging for fossils? Uh... Ever since I was a little girl, I had a love of nature. And, of course, I was raised on stories and fairy tales. My father was a professor of origin mythologies and folklore. Yeah, a folklorist. I thought they were all extinct. And your mother? What does she do? - She died when I was ten. - I'm sorry? She died when I was ten. Huh. Well, at least you two had each other. You and your father, right? Yeah. What? My dad had a huge heart, and an even bigger imagination, so... Eventually, he kind of lost touch with reality. Really? "You have to believe in something to see it," he always said. Yeah, and then, his beliefs went a little too far. - Ah. - Yeah. I once believed I'd be a writer. I'm writing a book right now, actually, about a monk that can tear his head off and throw it at the bad guys so he can bite them. - That's unreal. - Right? Also, he'll pull off his fingers and throw them like darts, and... Professor Tidemann? - Nora. - Captain Holm, Special Operations Command. - Andreas Isaksen, Prime Minister's Office. - Welcome to Lesja. Huh. Here's what we know. Whatever it was came from that direction. It made its way across the river and into the valley. The tracks continue two miles south into the mountains, then come to a stop. - Come to a stop? - Yes. Huh. - There haven't been any other sightings? - We did a sweep of the area. We found nothing. - You're a paleontologist? - Her main field is paleobiology. Ah... Right. So, uh, what's the theory? That a T-rex has strayed into the Norwegian mountains? Well, that remains to be seen, Captain Holm. Kris. You can call me Kris. Captain Kris? Yeah. Well, I, uh... I couldn't see it clearly. It... It was dark. I see. Were the clouds outside blocking the sun? No, ma'am. It was something else. It was as if we were in the shadow of the mountain. And the mountain was m... moving. Ugh. It scared Solo to death. Huh, Solo? Huh? My poor boy. - Huh? Yes, it did. Didn't it? - And, um... Are there any other details you can remember? Any memory of what happened, anything at all. I don't... I'm so sorry, but I'm... I'm still in shock. It's okay. Mmm. Thank you very much. There was one thing... - Mm-hm. - There was this sound. It... It sounded like it was... howling? What are you talking about? I didn't hear any howling. Lars can't hear anything. He has to wear hearing aids. What? Uh, howling? Howling like some wind? No, it sounded more like a... melody. A sad melody. It was heartbreaking. It's almost like a natural disaster made its way through this valley. A natural disaster on two legs. What is that? What? That smell? Norwegian nature. Yeah. And something... more. More than nature? Yes. Hypernature. Hypernature. Whoa. Look how deep it is. - What are you doing? - UV light. Checking for biological traces. See anything? Nothing. Only earth and stones. What? Forget about it. It's just some old rhyme. Is there a plan? What are you thinking? Did you say it was two miles south of here? It stops down there. No more tracks. Look at the thermal scanner. There's no sign of life. Nothing's there, just mountains. Impossible. It's too big to just disappear into thin air. And no place to hide. CAMOUFLAGE? Do you have a theory? - Damn it! - What is it? Ugh. There's someone we need to... visit. Listen, if it's okay with you, um, it's better if I do all the talking... I'm staying here! I won't go back there. We aren't taking you anywhere. Lower the shotgun, Papa, please! Tiny? Can you lower the shotgun? It's been a while. Yes, I've been kind of busy. Huh... What's up with the egghead? Andreas Isaksen. Advisor to Prime Minister Moberg. Ha! Yeah. - Everything okay? - Hey! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! - Easy! - Hey, hey! Put it down. This is Captain Kris... toffer Holm. And Kris, this is Tobias Tidemann. It's... It's... It's her father. Okay. It's a pleasure. Can we go inside and talk? Come on. This is important. Maybe... Get some pants to put on as well. I see you hired a decorator. Uh... No. The winter of 1943, the Nazis used Russian war prisoners to build the Nordland Railway, but only got to Bodø. Some believe the construction stopped due to something they found inside the mountain. Oh yeah? What was it? Something came out of the mountain. Exactly. But it would've been hard to prove, so they got rid of the witnesses and suppressed all of it. No, Papa. Today. Something came out of the mountain today. We have followed footprints of this, uh, thing. But they just stop, all of a sudden. Huh, huh, huh, huh, huh, huh, huh, huh. And no superstition, fairy tales, or fantasy, or any of that. We've put all that to rest, right, Papa? I just thought there may be something in your work to point us in the right direction. You know these mountains better than anyone. Ah... Did you know Norway imposed the maximum penalty for contact with trolls up until 1840? Trolls? Why were we never taught that trolls actually existed? Tobias! They wandered freely a thousand years ago. It's the truth. Didn't I just tell you not to bring that up again? You know a thousand years is just a blip in the evolutionary process. If the trolls really lived here, scientist would've found DNA profiles or troll fossils in sedimentary rocks, and their extinction could be explained. We already know the explanation for why they died off. The Christianization of Norway. Oh, and why does no one else know about this except you? That's because I was this close to revealing it all. They threw me in the loony bin. They have always known. For the love of God... Kittelsen, what was he hiding? This obvious mistake. Was it on purpose? - Mistake? - Please. The collection of folk tales, all the myths, all the artwork he did. - It was to cover up the truth. - Papa! Every recorded fairy tale was written to tarnish the trolls' reputation. To make fun of them. Asbjørnsen and Moe's contribution. They portrayed them as dumb! Evil and stingy. Meanwhile, the humans were so great! We're enlightened and mentally superior. Yeah. If you tell a lie enough times, people will take it as the truth. - Ah! The egghead admits it. - Huh? Of course! Wait. I think we should take a couple minutes to breathe... - That sounds like a good plan. - A couple minutes? We can't waste a second. Let's get going, Tiny. Don't call me that. An adventure! Watch your head. They stop abruptly. We're right here, is that right? That's the spot. Yeah? That means he walked from there all the way here. "He"? I suppose it could be a gyger. A... gyger? An ogress. A female troll. Ay... Take the chopper down! Here! Take it down! Go down now! Old man Tidemann. An interesting guy. He's always been a tad... eccentric. And then, he went so far down the rabbit hole he lost his job over it. It's pretty sad, actually. He was committed to a hospital for a while. I see. I... I hoped I would find him in a better state. Hey, I should probably help. - Okay. - I think that's a good idea. You find anything? It's wrong. Everything is wrong here. What is? Everything. Topography. It doesn't match. Everything is off. See? Eh... What? It's been a while. You and I adventuring, just like old times. This isn't a reconciliation between us. Please don't, okay. I still remember the sparkle in your eye when I told you about the secrets of the world. The same curiosity as your mother. What happened? I grew up, all right? Oh, come on. What do you think we're looking for here, Nora? Hmm? What you're suggesting is nothing but a fantasy. The dinosaurs were also once considered fantasy creatures. - Unnatural. - No, they are nature. - For God's sake. - Made of earth and stones. From within the mountain, it rose from the ground... Hm? - What is it? - That smell. Look, I bathe every Saturday. Not you, it's... hypernature. Hypernature? Hypernature... - Papa? - Huh? Kris. Start the engine. Come on! Come on! Call up Oslo! Yes. Putting it on the screen now. You need to see this! What in the hell is that? RENA MILITARY CAMP ØSTERDALEN - Pretty intense, huh? - Yeah. - Even the square is scared. - Yes, it's big. - Papa? - Yeah? No matter what they ask... Whatever the people in uniforms say, swear you won't say the word "troll". Okay? Troll? What do you mean, troll? - Does the sound not work or...? - He doesn't mean a fairy tale creature. - It's more like a... - A troll! This is a troll! I'm sorry. The point is that we really don't know what kind of creature we're dealing with unless we have more time to... Time? We don't have one second to waste. Yes, but we can't make rash decisions either. What are you suggesting? Inviting the troll to a friendly race? Just like in the fairy tales? Here's my two cents. All due respect. I don't think you're mentally stable if you fail to see that tunneling through the Dovre Mountains... - Papa. - ...is a mockery of nature. - But that's what you guys do! - Tobias. Just move ahead. Never stopping to ask if you should! - What are you doing? - I'm helping. No, you're not! This is just like our PTA meetings... Are you finished? - That crazy teacher of yours... - If I may interrupt. This isn't a small ogre we're talking about, but a fully grown mountain troll. - Get that man out of here. - 20 years I've been doing troll research. And I'm the crazy one?! I'm the crazy one? - I'll take care of it. - Yeah, good luck! - Excuse me. - Hey. Enough! I'll go! - Let go of me! Let go of me! - Prime Minister. The answer may come if you please give us more time. Okay? I'm sorry, Tidemann. The risk is too high. We're implementing a military operation. You insist on your fairy tale theories, but this isn't some mystical fantasy creature that can smell Christian blood and turns to stone in sunlight. If you're so sure about it, why'd you come to me? This is the end of our little adventure. I'm going back to the dig. It was nice to see you, Papa. Imagine waking up, and everything you know is gone. You wake up to a whole new world. Like this troll... This creature... You think it wants to be here? We can scare it with weapons. We can push it around. But I promise, Nora. Nature will push back. What do you want to do? Just give up? Even egghead doesn't want to give up. No... The adventure has just begun. There you are. Kris! Captain! You're civilians, Tidemann. This is a military operation. Oh, so now we're on a last-name basis, Captain Holm? We won't be in the way. We will only observe. You won't even know we're there. - Hey! - Sorry. Sorry! It's completely out of the question. But we have to bend the rules a little sometimes, don't we? Kris. Please. Tidemann. - Yes? - Yeah? If you do come along, you have to lay low and follow my orders. Understand? And if Oslo finds out I brought you along... Yeah, I... Don't worry. You'll be dead before sunrise. Go! Go! Go! Go! Now! Ladies and gentlemen, we are live from Heidal. Piranha, this is Viking. Status? Over. Viking, this is Piranha. We are in position. Over. 3-Alpha, status? Over. Viking, this is 3-Alpha. We are in position. Over. Copy that. What now? We wait. So do I have this right? He can take off his own head... Yeah. He can throw it at people and bite them? Exactly, or his hand. He can rip it off and throw it, like a fist-snowball. Huh. Fascinating. Yeah, it, uh... Can you picture it? Wandering around in large herds. Families. "Made of earth and stones." "A snow-clad heart, and ice for bones." I remember it all. The fairy tales from you and Mom, and all the... emptiness after. How we dealt with it. I remember that as well. The adventures of Big and Tiny. Is this a reconciliation thing? You and me? Is that a PVS-31? Uh, it is, actually. That's what I thought. - Do you have military experience? - A little. Oh yeah? "Call of Duty." Nora, the truth is, um... you lost us both, when your mother died. You're here now. You old fossil. Mm. Are you crying? It's my pine allergy. I'm allergic to forests. - Ah... - Pretty sweet, huh? These things give you a real arcade feeling, am I right? - Yeah. - 3-Alpha for Viking. - 3-Alpha for Viking, over. - Viking, go ahead. Copy that. I need my helmet. Here... Loosen the strap. - Ow! - Hold still. - Get your fat fingers out of there. - Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow! Man... He's here. Can I see? It's stopping. Ah, he knows we're here. Oslo, this is Viking. Awaiting orders. Viking, you are authorized to open fire. 3-Alpha, this is Viking. Engage the target. Copy that. Open fire. You idiots! What the hell... It's not working. You're pissing him off. 3-Alpha, fall back! 3-Alpha, fall back! Piranha, open fire! Repeat, open fire! Copy that, Viking. 9-8! 9-8! Open fire! Take cover! We have incoming, take cover now! - Stay back. - Move back. Everyone get back. Stay back! Let's go! Let's go! Run! Over here! Hallowed be Thy name. Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done... ...on earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread. And forgive us... our trespasses. Amen. Time to move out. Oh God! Oh shit! Someone help! Oh! - God save me, please! - Christian blood. He smelled the blood. We have to move. Come on. - Hey! - Papa! Well, hello there. All right. Easy. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Easy. That's right. It's okay. That's right... Oh yeah. I'm a friend. Papa! Papa? Papa? Papa? - Ah... - Are you okay? Don't move. We'll get some help. Nora. You saw it. Shh, save your energy. You saw. The palace... The king... Home... Listen, my child... Believe... Papa? Papa. No! THE ADVENTURES OF TINY AND BIG KINGDOM/CASTLE? MEANING??? HOME! So is he a robot? No, no, no. He's a zen master using his spirituality to manipulate the physical realm. Uh, okay. - Oh, hey. - Good morning. Hi. Any news? Well, we're tracking it with a drone. It came to a stop in a valley. And? They're preparing an air strike now. What? How come? Nora... We don't have a lot of options. I mean, uh... What are we even facing? I can't explain what I saw. I don't know what to believe anymore. Let's assume. Let's assume what? Let's assume there's truth to the fairy tales. Nora, you've been through a lot in the last 24 hours. - I think it's best... - Hey, I found it! Huh? Your father. He said that Kittelsen made a mistake... in the drawing. See? Trolls can't survive the sun. But look. The troll is roaming the streets in broad daylight. No, then Kittelsen was right. What do you mean? We've seen it during the day. But, what other rules are there from the fairy tales? Are you serious? - Okay. - It's... It's just so... So sunlight aside... Remember. We... We grew up with these, Andreas. - Come on. - Uh, don't feed them after midnight? Tell me you guys are joking right now. Crosses... Crosses? - Isn't that vampires? - Crosses? Not crosses... The Christians. The soldier. Look. "It smells like Christian blood in here." - The Christianization of Norway. - Okay. MOISTURE - BOULDERS The plan you're suggesting is completely insane. Foolish and insane! We can't be advised by far-fetched... Superstition? Fiction? Come on! Seriously? Old myths make reference to trolls throwing boulders at churches. Because they hated the sound of the bells. This keeps getting better and better! Where do you stand on this, Andreas? Uh, Prime Minister. Um, up until this point, based on the information we can gather... - We can't seem to find... - General? Permission to speak freely, sir? Go ahead, Captain. This enemy we're facing... it's something we've never seen before. The modern weapons we tried had no effect. I believe that Professor Tidemann is right. We have to think outside the box now. Prime Minister. Tidemann's proposal is radical. That's for sure. And if there's one thing that Captain Holm and I both know, it's that extreme circumstances call for extreme measures. Very well. - Carry out the operation. - Are you kidding me? If we evacuate now, it will be total chaos. - People will panic. - But we need a plan. - But we just can't... - It's up. And it's moving southeast. What's in its path? HUNDERFOSSEN FAMILY PARK LILLEHAMMER - Thank you! - Don't run too far, okay. Viktor? Earthquake. Tidemann, what will the bells do? Will it explode? Oh great. This is Hocus 1. Hold formation, let's make the first pass. It's working! This is Hocus 1. We have to move closer. Viktor! Hocus 3. Incoming, left side! Mayday, mayday! We're going down! Hocus 4, climb, climb, climb! No. You saw that, right? Did he mean to do that? We have shocking images coming out of Norway at this hour. We are on the ground here in Norway, and it's a nation in panic. People running for their lives from what seems to be a giant creature. Could it be a Norwegian Godzilla? They don't know what kind of creature they're dealing with. It just... really scared me. More than a dozen buildings were crushed. The military is everywhere! We're talking about a monster here! - Devastation. - Destruction... Total chaos. Imagine the consequences if this creature reaches more populated areas. If we follow these tracks, it appears to be heading straight for the capital. In Norway, the military is struggling to find a way to stop what appears to be a monster. We know it wasn't the desired outcome, but... we are onto something here. Because we saw the bells had an effect. We have to face the facts. - Sooner or later. - Yes. We have a killing machine making its way towards the capitol. Yes, time is of the essence. Which is why it's important to find out what we're up against here. We have to find out why it's coming here. Figuring that out gives us a chance to... So what is it, then? If you open up your mind to it... What do you think? A threat! That's all I need to know. This is a threat that must be stopped by force. - And not hocus-pocus. - Prime Minister. The incredible isn't impossible. Thank you kindly for your contribution, Professor Tidemann. Tidemann. Uh, hi. Nora? No one could've done any better. They're making a mistake. That's what I think. Captain Kris. Just let me know, if there's anything else I can do. As long as church bells aren't involved. I'll do my best. We'll barricade all roads from the northeast. And if it breaks through them? Well, there is... another alternative. No. No? What are you talking about? We, uh, have at our disposal, missiles that have yet to be approved... officially. What you are suggesting goes against everything the Norwegian Armed Forces stand for. Not to mention the catastrophic damage... What kind of weapons are we talking about? Why wasn't I informed of this before? - It was still in development. - We shouldn't even be considering this. Prime Minister. Um, should he be here? Really? Why don't you leave us alone for a moment, Andreas? You can consider this my resignation. Excuse me. Nora! I'll take it from here. What are you doing? You, uh... You forgot this. Come on. Come on. I... I'll... I'll drive. What's going on? They're evacuating Oslo. Fellow citizens. Many of you have already heard the news from the Dovre area. And the media coverage showing what happened at Gudbransdalen. And you could have thought that these were special effects. However, this is not make believe. This is all real. Norway has been prepared to deal with major crises. But nothing could have prepared us all for the crisis we are currently facing. A creature unknown to science has risen from deep within Dovre Mountain. So now our history must be re-written. But we need to ensure the safety of our citizens and country... right now. Since the first reports came in from Dovre Mountain yesterday, the government, the armed forces, and our top scientists have done their best to get control of the situation. It is with a heavy heart that I tell you that our efforts so far, unfortunately, have failed. We have deemed it necessary to explore all options to prevent the loss of human lives. I urge you all to take this situation as seriously as the administration and parliament does. I hereby declare a state of emergency. And the immediate evacuation of Oslo and all neighboring areas. We have faced crises in the past, and endured. We stood united. We took care of each other. With every fiber of my being, I beg you. Look out for one another. And God bless us all. And our fatherland. Resignation. I said resignation. That's something my grandpa would say. Why couldn't I have said "I quit" like normal people do? I'm such a bonehead. - Sinding? - Mm... I don't get what it means. He's written it more than once. Sinding, and something about a Gatekeeper. It could be Rikard Sinding. Who's that? The Palace Lord Chamberlain. I, uh, kind of know him. We met a few times at the Royal Palace. KINGDOM/PALACE? MEANING??? The Palace... Home... The king... - What is it? - Turn around. - Turn around? - Home's the Royal Palace. Okay... Sorry, sorry. Sorry! Prime Minister's Office! THE ROYAL PALACE OSLO Stop! Freeze! - We come in peace. - Hands in the air! - Turn around, walk back to the car! - We're from the Prime Minister's Office. - Get back, all right! - We don't have time for this! This is your last warning! Fine. We can wait, I guess. Walk back slowly, towards the car! Stand down, gentlemen. Stand down. Sinding! Remember me? Isaksen. Prime Minister Moberg's advisor. I assumed that someone would show up eventually. I can't say I'm surprised that it was a child of Tidemann's. You have your father's eyes. I had a lot of respect for your father. Although I know Tobias despised me, he really was a good man. And stubborn as a mule. I can count on one hand the number of living people who have seen what you are about to see. I would normally insist on ladies going first. I won't tell anyone. There was a time when it was believed to be good luck to build the Royal Palace on top of another king's home. It was nearly discovered in the 1920s during construction for the subway. And once again. Twelve years ago. Twelve years ago? I deeply regretted what we did to Tobias. But it had to be done. I'm sorry. You destroyed the life of an innocent man, and all you give is some bullshit apology? I hope this will provide you some answers. This was the home of the Troll King. Oh God! During the Christianization of Norway, Olav the Holy rid the land of anything incompatible with the new faith. He knew, that even for trolls, nothing could be more important than family. What happened? An ambush. It was a massacre. But, they spared one of the Mountain King's children. And used it to lure him to Dovre, deep into the mountain. Where they locked him up inside a cavern. Where they left him for dead. Then my father was right. The king is making his way back to his castle. He's going home. Andreas. See that? From darkness they came. And died in the light. That can't be right. We... We've seen him in broad daylight. We've seen him during the day. But have we seen him in direct sunlight? How does that help us? We can't control the sun. What is the biggest vehicle you have? Open fire. Her Royal Highness the Queen's personal favorite, right over here. Okay. We've got wheels. Now, we need muscle. Hmm? Tidemann. Huh? A plan? It will destroy us. All of Oslo. Prime Minister, it's your decision. You have my approval. Let's kill this thing before it kills us. Downtown is too populated, but if we lure him away from the city center... Maybe Holmenkollen? That's too far away. We need something closer, and with an easier route. Mm-hm. Ekeberg. I can ask my buddies in the Home Guard. It's just... Where will we find that much U... I've got an idea. The following code, one, six, zero, three, seven, six, nine, nine, three, six, five, six, seven, nine. The following code, one, seven, eight, seven, six, eight... Code verified. Commencing mission immediately. All right! Get in! Sigmeister, give me good news. Oslo's barricades have been breached. Their plan is to bomb Oslo. - No, that can't be. - What's happening? Oslo is going to be flattened. We need to buy more time. I mean, can't you just hack the system? How hard can it be to hack into a military computer and override the most high-tech fighter plane ever made? Well, sorry! - I'm just trying to... - No. Seriously. How hard can it be, right? Huh? Ah, there she is. Make it so. WELCOME TO OSLO There's no time to explain. So I'll tell you later. EKEBERG FIELDS OSLO All set. Come on. The target is approaching the city center. HQ, this is Raven 4. Confirming course toward Oslo. TARGET: ØRLAND_AIRPORT "You shall not pass" Amir! Salaam alaikum. Alaikum salaam, brother. - You have a plan? - You recruit anyone? - The cavalry? - Hm? If we survive this... I'll owe you a Pepsi and a Toblerone. If your hacker friend fails us, then... Siggi is Spock to my Captain Kirk. Siggi has never failed. That's not even remotely possible. This is Raven 4. Target in sight. Awaiting orders. Engage. Blow it into pieces. Copy that. Firing missile in five... four... three... two... one. Huh? System malfunction. System malfunction. It's not working. Yahtzee. Oh... Siggi. Okay! - What's going on? - Uh, I don't know. Why isn't anything happening? For some reason, I can't establish contact with the control panel. Solve it! Just keep going. Get connected, for God's sake. What if the plan fails? Hm? What if I'm just like my father? Completely nuts. In a world gone mad, then only the crazy can be sane. And you're the craziest person on this planet, Nora Tidemann. Thank you. I guess. Okay, Andreas. Let's do this. Dear God. Heigh-ho. Let's go. Now! He's coming! He's coming! He's coming! Oh! Status? - We're close! - Not yet! Ah! We need more time. We don't have it! We'll be there in 15. Oh shit! Make it ten. No, Nora... We're not ready... Attention! Let's bring it in! Come on! We have an incoming threat from that direction. Estimated arrival is ten minutes out. What's about to come over that hill right now is unlike anything you've been up against before. And I'll be honest with you. There's a very good chance this operation won't go our way. But we have to ask ourselves... Who are we? If we lay down without a fight? Who are we if we let fear control us? Who could be proud if we let some damn creature waltz right over us without saying, "It ends here! We'll put you back in the ground!"? Yeah! The bridge is closed! Wait! The skull! We-we-we... We lost the skull! Hi, beautiful. Party time. He has nobody. The last one of his kind. This reminds me of Big Billy Goat Gruff. Unless you think a bigger billy goat is nearby, I suggest that you step on the gas especially fast! Still no connection? No, something is blocking the system from the inside. What are you doing? Uh... I'm glad you showed up. Um, I think someone hijacked my laptop. I opened this weird email, it was... from this prince in Nigeria... Do you realize what you've done? This is Raven 4. The system is online. Requesting new orders. You are still authorized to engage. Copy that. Let's end this nightmare. Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go! You need to get out! Get ready! - Nora! - Go, now! Nora! Amir, are we ready? We're close. Nora! Go! Go! Go! Nora! Get up! Raven 4 approaching the target. Locked and loaded. Civilians spotted. I repeat, civilians spotted. - Abort. - Abort. No, no, no, no, no, no. Abort. No, no, no, no, no. Screw that. Blow that thing up! - Raven 4. Abort. - Blow up that monster! - Abort! - God damn you! Blow it up! - I repeat, abort mission. - Blow it up, God damn you! We have to blow it up... Raven 4. Abort! Aborting mission. God, you're a genius! Whoo! We did it! Oh no... This is wrong. What? But the plan, Nora, it worked. It's really working. No. He won't survive this. Wasn't that the plan? It's not right. Nora? Nora, stop! Get back! Stop them! Stop! You have to go! Please, just get away from here! Amir. Stand down. Yes, sir. Go! Go back to the mountains! Please! Go where you're safe! They'll leave you alone if you just go! No more Norway Cup here, that's for sure. Oh. - Brother. - Brother. What do we call it? "Dovre Boulder"? "Tidemann Hill"? Maybe "Troll Rock"? "Tobias Boulder". That's nice. You look good with a black eye. Huh? Professor Tidemann. I don't know what to say. Prime Minister, before I go, I want to be clear, when I resigned, I didn't mean with work altogether, but just that I'm quitting this job. Berit, I'm gonna be a writer! Mm-hm. Do you think there are more out there? In a cave deep beneath some mountain?
