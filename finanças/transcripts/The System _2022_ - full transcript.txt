I'm gonna go. Put the money in the bag. You motherfucking... No! Oh shit! Aaah! - Freeze, motherfucker! Freeze! - Freeze, motherfucker! Get on the ground! Get on the ground! Take that fucking mask off your fucking face, motherfucker, now! Take it off now! Slowly, slowly, slowly. Mr. Terry Lamont Savage. African-American, born in Atlanta, straight from high school into the Marines. Quickly promoted to Sergeant, Special Ops Eclipse Unit. Nice. Silver Star in Afghanistan, Soldier's Medal in Iraq, and a Medal of Honor for your work in Nigeria. You're a-- You're a goddamn real life war hero! Who are you? I'm Police Commissioner Harvey Clarke. Now, what's a war hero like you doing robbing drug houses in my city? Hmm? No answer? Interesting. What happened to you, war hero? You've thrown away your entire military career for a life of crime? What if I was thrown away? I served my country, I come home, I can't afford medicine, food, I'm living in the fucking projects. What if I told you, that I could help you? We could help each other really. You see there's this prison on the outskirts of downtown. Degnan Correctional Institute. It's one of those corporate-backed private prisons that are propped up by closeted Republicans, you know who are supporting Wall Street goons. But that's not the point. There's this Warden there and he thinks he's God. No one but trusted employees and prisoners are allowed inside. And it is rumored that a lot of his guards are ex-military, hired directly by the Warden himself. I want you to go inside. Put your eyes on the place, find me some evidence of human rights violations, corruption. Anything you can get your hands on that I can use to put that motherfucker down. Go fuck yourself. Go fuck yourself! Now you see I could do that. Sit down, sit down. You're still facing 10 years hard time regardless for armed robbery. Now you could do 10 years in the state pen, or you could go inside Degnan and get me what I need. And I will set you free. You hear me? Free. Time served. Do it for your daughter. She's-- she's got blood-- Blood clots. And they-- and-- Do you-- do you understand that? So what's your answer? SAVAGE'S DAUGHTER All I need is you. So if you would just come back by my side I know I'll get better. Love, I won't be gone. I won't be gone for long. Okay? SAVAGE'S DAUGHTER I had a dream you and I, we're playing basketball on the basketball court by our old house. You don't have to dream it we can do it again. When I-- when I get this medicine, we're gonna be able to play it all day, without ever having to stop. Time. Daddy, you're what I need. When you get inside, there's gonna be something waiting for you from me in your cell. That will be the only way that you can report directly to me from that shitshow. Other than that, you're on your own. Watch yourself, so you can get back to that little girl. Move! Move! Move! Get in here! Stop! My name is Lieutenant Killian, and I own you now! I will tell you when to bathe! I will tell you what to wear! I will tell you when to eat, sleep, and shit! Now move! 6-2-A. Get in here! He's gonna pat you down and you better not motherfucking move, boy. Spread your legs. Chip him. I don't fuck with needles. Chip him now. Put his ass in Pod 7. Open doors to Pod 7. Get up, shitbags! Get on back! Hey asshole! I said get on back. Get your ass out here. Right now! Today sister, get over there, boy. Move it! All accounted for! Chow time! Clumsy monkey! That's right, get on your knees and bow down! Looks like I'm gonna have to teach you some respect, little monkey boy. I'll see you soon, boy. I'll see you real soon. Yo yo. You're new here, right? Well, I hope you can fight, motherfucker. How are you liking your stay thus far? Yo, this motherfucker still didn't realize where he is yet. Motherfucker. What's your story, black man? You an ally or an enemy? I'm my own man. Yeah. Well, let me give you some advice. Up in here, you're gonna need allies. Now you could join my family, my mafia. We protect our own. I fly solo. And you gonna die solo, too. Maybe he wanna die. Just give me the word. You will all be given your work assignments. You will perform your assignments twice a day unless only altered by the Warden himself. Clean this. Clean this shit. Some of us don't like the way you've been running things for the Warden. Bitch, this ain't no democracy. Hey! "Remember your promise to me. It is my hope. Your promise revives me. It comforts me. Protects me from all of my troubles." Welcome to hell, boy. Are you the new boy? Told you I'd see you soon, didn't I? Down or I'll open fire! Oh whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Get these assholes in the bean hole! I came here, because you went to sleep without your superpowers. Ah. Man up. Man up. Take it, take it. Take that fucking. Now the next time you attack another prisoner without my permission, I'm gonna turn up the settings, understood? -Yes, sir. -Alright. Now because you broke the rules, you're gonna have to pick two of your own to fight against each other. Warden, come on, please don't make me do-- Okay, okay, okay. Okay! Understood. Alright, get the fuck out of here. Oh, hold on. The final thing as discussed. I apologize for my-- No, fuck that shit. In his eyes. Right in his fucking soul, come on! I apologize for my actions. I would personally like to apologize for his actions. Sometimes our fellow inmates, they can get out of control. I am sorry. Terry Savage. Welcome, sir, have a seat. Have a seat right there. I got some stuff I wanna tell you about. I'm excited, welcome. Oh yeah, that's the wife. Beauty queen right here. She can't cook for shit though, I'll tell you that much. Yeah, with her, we have to pray after we eat, so we don't shit ourselves. That was a joke, soldier. You can laugh at that. I'll tell you one thing. I will kill for my family. You got a family? Well, I've got a daughter. What's that? I can't hear you. I have a daughter. You have a daughter. Look at that, alright. Well, then you got one goal here, one singular focus. To get back to her as soon as you can. You see, this prison is owned by a corporation, right. It's one in a long line of privately-owned prisons, it's a chain, alright. Just like Burger King or McDonald's and I guess I'm like this branch's CEO. But I gotta be honest with you, Terry, it's boring as shit. Looking in on the product. Right, we got some McNuggets, what's in there. Got a McRib, You gotta Mcfucking rehabilitation situation, I don't give a fuck. No excitement in it. So I gotta make it interesting. So what I've done is, I've created The Dungeon. The Dungeon? Yeah, The Dungeon. And from what I heard about you, you're pretty handy, you can handle yourself in there, you'll have a good time. It's a way to kill time and to earn rewards. What's in your wallet? That's another joke. It's alright, you can laugh, soldier. Also, it's a good way for you to get back to your daughter, faster. Alright? Now, what I need you to do is meet your new roommate. He's gonna prep you, seeing that you two already get along. I got a good feeling about you, Terry. Alright. Get on out of here. Gina, give him his prize. Savage? The Sergeant Terry Savage? I served in the 77th Wolfpack. You and your squad saved my life when my troops were outnumbered right outside Kabul a few years ago. You're a legend. I was just doing my job only. I don't know how somebody like you ends up in here. Don't expect no favors. I'm just doing my job. Now move. Yes, ma'am. Open 243. Go on. Welcome. Make yourself at home. Would you please um, respect my house and take off your shoes. It's my house, no shoes. Okay. So, you play dominoes? No. Damn. Where'd you learn to fight? My father was a Grand Master up in Okla. So I grew up in his dojo where he taught me how to fight, physically and spiritually. You're gonna have to survive The Dungeon. Whatever it takes. I just wanna get home to my daughter. Well, you're inside the system now, soldier. This place was designed to break black and brown bodies like you and you fell right in. So if you have any hope of ever seeing your little girl again, you gonna need to do two things. The first one is forget about that outside world. Including, your little girl, 'cause holding onto that unreality will get you killed in this reality. And secondly, you're gonna have to survive The Dungeon. I can help you do that. Why should I trust you or anybody else in this system? You can't. You mind if I use your bathroom, OG? Call me "Bones". It's your bathroom now. Mind the curtain. Where're we going? Our new work assignment. Keep moving! Get to work. Now this area right here, this entire place used to be used to break up circuit boards that the Warden would re-sell. Now we get to use it to spar here. They got us locked up like animals. Now we gotta fight like 'em. See you're different from a lot of the catch that run through this place. That's why when the Warden asked why I helped you, I told him it's 'cause you reminded me of a young man I knew a long time ago. Now no matter what, in order to survive this place, you're going have to fight. The Warden is gonna throw your ass inside that Dungeon whether you like it or not and whether you live or die, depends on what you know. Now let me help you. Do me the favor and show me what you got. That's the Mexican Mob over there, la familia. Then you've got the Dragon Nation, ruthless. Nobody fucks with them. And you've met the Aryan Brotherhood, aka The Klan, With your encounter with Mongul, their uh, leader. Y'all gonna be good friends. Now you've met my man Freeway. He's crew is the Black Mafia. His style is a combination of almost every style. But his nature is formless, so he calls himself "Freeway". That's crazy, combine other styles. He's good at that. I taught him. That's enough, that's enough. Now I'm gonna share something with you that I've rarely seen or said. You got all the heart in the world, but if you're gonna survive The Dungeon tomorrow night, you're gonna need some skill. What do you mean tomorrow? Every Friday, is spent here in that Dungeon. Let me show you what will help you. It starts with this. Surrender, surrender. Accept where you are. Accept this reality. Dungeon Time! Stop! Take them to The Dungeon. I gotta go meet the Warden. Yes, sir. I don't think your boy is gonna make it, Bones. Hey let's go, come on. Good luck down there, Savage. Open 305. Right. Rene, hold my calls. Who wants it tonight? I'm getting hungry, and hungry, and hungry. We're going to the-- I can feel it, it's in the air, as the bones crush. Welcome to The Dungeon. Welcome to The Dungeon! ({inmates cheering] Here we are, trapped in this hall together. But look, we get out of our cages once a week for one reason only. And that is, The Dungeon! I need y'all to understand that there is one rule and one rule only. Alright? And that's that there are no motherfucking rules! Make some noise! Let's get it on! Let's go, gentlemen. Show me what you got. Fucking Warden! Well... you made your bed, son, you made your bed. Alright. Who's up next? Let's go. Keep it moving. There's a momentum score, people. Freeway! Freeway! Freeway! Freeway! Freeway! Freeway! Freeway! Freeway! Freeway! It's pointless. Where are you? Ah! Freeway! Freeway! Freeway! Freeway! Freeway! Freeway! Freeway! Freeway! Freeway! Freeway! Freeway! Freeway! Freeway! Now, up next we got some fresh meat, by the name of Savage! Who was causing hell upstairs, so we brought him downstairs for a little training. Let's see what you got, Savage. In the opposing corner, we have our local favorite from the Mexican Mob, El Vampiro!!! He calls himself, "El Vampiro" because he sharpens his teeth like a vampire. He ain't going for your face, he's going for your legs. This whole thing is to take you down. Watch yourself. Watch your hands of course. Wooh, wooh, wooh, yeah. Reach inside of him, pull his soul out, if he have one. You trained about black eyes and bloody noses. You gotta go out there as life of fucking death. What's wrong? Don't let him take the next round! Come on, get him, man! Come on now. Let's go, keep it moving. What the fuck was that? Okay. That's how you do it! Yeah! Yeah! That's what I'm talking about. Yeah! At least bring some water. Carry that man. We ain't-- we ain't got all day for this. You alright? Freeway! Mmm. There's my quarterback. That's some great work in The Dungeon, my man. What can I get for you? Steak dinner? A conjugal? Anything you want, you name it. How about you cut the bullshit? Tell me why Bones is helping the new guy? Well, hold-- Eh, slow down, son. What-- I-- It sounds like you're interrogating me. Well, I mean I'm the best motherfucker you got. Don't I deserve to know? Bones claims that the new kid reminds him of family or something. And he requested to have his back. What-- wh-- What's going on here? Are you intimidated, by the new guy? What's happening? I ain't intimidated by nobody. Good. Then everything will remain peaceful around here. Yeah. Things are peaceful, because I'm the one. I'm the one enforcing your law in and outside The Dungeon. And you're doing a lovely job. Have I not told you how much I appreciate you? Good. Great, because I want what you promised me. So when do I get out? Are we doing this again? Are we doing it? Look, let me get this straight. Hold on a second. I let you and your crew, your posse, whatever you wanna call, treat this whole place like it's your own private little street corner. That's what I'm doing for you. That's not enough? Yeah. Yeah, I got shit on lock. But if you can't keep your word, then maybe I can't guarantee that all these prisoners are gonna keep falling in line. Are you... It sounds like you're threatening me? That-- Have I created a monster? I want my freedom, that's what you fucking promised me. I'mma working on it. I'm having conversations with the Warden at the Aurora State Prison about getting you a re-match with his Top Dog. You win that for me again, you get your freedom. Stay sharp! I'm always sharp. I want my freedom. Alright. Yeah, well, I want Cindy Crawford to rub my balls and make me a casserole. But I live in reality, motherfucker! Savage, you have a visitor. Hi, Mr. Savage, it's a pleasure to meet you in person. I'm Janette. I work for a pro-bono group, National Veterans Affairs and I've been assigned your case. You are a highly-decorated soldier and I'm aware of your daughter's medical condition. You're not a criminal. You were pushed into a corner. You can't help me. I graduated cum laude from Howard University School of Law. I'm hihgly capable. I'm prepared to fight for your freedom. Freedom? Yeah. There's been a lot of intel coming out about too many new private prisons and a lack of prisoners to keep them filled. And some cities are so desperate to keep these institutions open and the extra boost it gives to the local job economy, they are creating a new system. One of supply and demand of live human bodies. Mostly our people, black and brown people. Mr. Savage, I need you to stay strong, okay? We can fight this corrupt system together. I just need you to trust me. I'm in here. They have physical custody of my body. They own me. Therefore, I must do what they say when they say. Listen, if you-- if you need anything, call me. I am goin' to do everything I can to get you out of here. I-- I appreciate you, but um, I'm gonna have to handle this on my own. Ignore him. You know I don't give a fuck about what he's showin' you. I hope you know that. You can't fuck with me. I ain't like these other motherfuckers. You know, the truth is you and Freeway are a whole lot alike. I ain't got shit to do with that man. Oh yeah, you do. Think about it. Both of y'all are ex-military. He spent most of his life fightin' in the streets, too. Truth is I tried to save him, but he refused to let me help him. He was determined to take the dark path. What makes you think I ain't gonna go dark? You got your little girl. That gives you something to live for, that's something that Freeway never even had. So in that case, you two are polar opposites. Yin and yang. Now this next fighter that you're gonna face is named "Zee". He is the Dragon Nation's best fighter. If you have any chance of beating him, you're going to have to use your strength against his agility and his speed. Brute force. Sometimes it's okay to go gorilla, eh. Welcome to the dungeon! Now we're back for another one now. In the right corner, we've got the new came back for round 2 Savage! Right, that's right now. In the other corner... ...from the Dragon Nation, Zee! All right, that's right! That's right, let's get it on! Let's go. What'd you do, grow a conscience? Come on. The shit is over. He was gonna kill you. What you got wrong? Boo! Hey, wait a minute, where you goin'? Where's he goin'? You're gonna leave us? All right, who's up next? Hopefully, they will close the show. Let's go! You know, one of the good things about being an OG in this place is you know where to get what you need. Yeah. I got nothin' to celebrate. This ain't no celebration, man. We-- it's a reward for still bein' alive. Come on, man, don't-- don't insult me. Huh, these days I drink just about anything, man. Why are you on the inside? Murder. Murder? Yeah, murder. See you ain't the only holder of a patent on stupidity. I was young like you once, too. Anyway, um... This psycho rapist put his hands on my little sister. I mean she was 21, but she's still my baby sister. So I went out for revenge, and I found him, and uh, beat that predator to death with my bare hands. What started out for revenge, the karma of the universe, man, I ended up having to pay with my soul. Don't let that happen to you. You know, sometimes I wonder... ...if I still have a soul. You do. I can see it. Hey, you want some chips? What's goin' on? You're a threat now. Fuck. Freeze or I'll drop you both! No! Shit, oh shit. Fuck. Hold on. Hold on, no, wait. I was just doing my job. Oh. Oh my God. Now we're even. Please. Help! Come in. Hey, thank you. Because of your quick thinkin' that guard's gonna live and you saved my ass from a lot of unwanted attention. That female guard, she risked it all for me. She did. I feel your pain, believe me, I do. It's one thing if a prisoner dies on the inside, but a guard? Man, that shows my-- my weakness to control this institution. So thank you. And by the way, I might have a little talk with Freeway. For what? Fuck him. I'm ready to take his ass out. Set up the fight. No, you haven't made your way to that fight yet. Sorry, I can't make that happen. Why not? You control all the shit inside these walls, right? That I do. I control it all. Don't get it twisted. But uh, is that a fight you're ready for? Set it up. Guard, back to my cell. All right. All right. Yeah, you know, you fucked up, right? We thought we'd take him out for you, man? Yeah, well, you thought wrong. I never gave that fuckin' order! Dumbass motherfucker. Warden wants to see you in the dungeon. All of you. Y'all wanna know why this is my favorite room? It's 'cause I can turn off these cameras whenever I want. Yeah. Come on in the ring, boys, I wanna talk about some business! Oh, that's funny, I-- I could have sworn I was in charge. See the ring, go there! You still can't follow rule. Okay. You broke my motherfuckin' rules! Kill him! What the f-- what the fuck, man? I'm the head motherfucker in charge. I never gave that order. I get it. Fuck, I get it! I fucked up. I'm glad we're on the same page now. Now you're gonna do whatever I want. What do you want from me? I want you to fight Savage. No, he hasn't earned that spot. Why are you so fuckin' stupid? You wanna spend the rest of your life in prison? You afraid of him? What is it? Okay. I'll fight. I'm glad we're on the same page. I'm glad you're excited. I am. Would be great to see the two of you battle it out. I'm glad we had this little attitude adjustment. Back to your cage, top dog. Move! What are you specifically hitting? A person. A person. Well, hit what he's goin' to hit you with. Hit his hands. Let his hands come at you, and anticipate it, and stop it. I heard you wanna see me in the dungeon. I don't fuck with bullies. How about we give 'em what they want. Peach punch. With purpose. Pull it back. Hands to the head, bro. I want you to remember why you agreed to do this in the first place. To save your daughter, man. Get to your girl. All authorized personnel to the dungeon. Wooh, shit! You ready? God damn! Let's see if we're gonna crown ourselves a new king! My kingdom for a crown. See who's ready to change their lives. Come on now. Man, can you feel it? Yes, sir. Man, I love you. Take it away, warden! Fight! - Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight! - Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight! Tonight, gentlemen, I got something truly special for you. Two gladiators, two warriors. One will come out a champion and the other... Well, there may be a lot of slow singin' and flower bringin' when that motherfuckin' bell starts ringin'. You know what I'm sayin'? Let's give it up for Savage! And over here, we got our top dog. Give it up for Freeway! Let's get it on! Yeah! Savage! Stop! What? That's enough. Come on! Wooh, Savage is the man now, baby! Savage! Savage! Savage! - Savage! Savage! Savage! Savage! - Savage! Savage! Yeah! That's the spirit. Come on! Savage, Savage, Savage, Savage, Savage, Savage, Savage, Savage! Wooh! Well, if you don't mind... Apparently, you are the man. I could get used to this. But the part you left out is havin' to keep eyes on the back of my head. Ain't no growin' when you don't. The warden wants to see you. When you're done eating, of course. That's too much power for one convict. There he is. How does it feel to be The Man now? Huh? Have a seat. Go on, have a seat! You deserve it. You kiddin' me? The way you just beat down Freeway, I could have sold that for 69.99 on pay-per-view. You and me we could do a lot of business together. Come on. You know what? Let's go for a walk. Come on. Take a little victory lap, champ. Let's go, champ. I wanna show you somethin'. Come on. Look at this. See that? All eyes are on you, Tupac. Come on now. You got everyone's attention now and you got my attention as well. You're the people's champ. Can you feel it? You feel that power? So you think about that what you wanna do with that. I got a proposition for you. You see what I see? Yeah, a lot of bad decisions. Yeah, I see what you see. These are fathers, big brothers. Leaders, kings, patriarchs, alphas. They come in here with a problem, they leave with a problem. There's no rehabilitation, sir. All right, well, listen, let me tell you something. I'm a problem solver, okay? Walk with me. I wanna show you how to solve your problems. I can't fix everyone's problem. Come on, let's walk. All right, listen-- Got you. Come on. Come on, champ, listen to me. You could run this place. With me havin' your back, come on now, nothing could take you down. Nothing. You wanna run this place? I don't want it. Well, before you turn me down, why don't you see what you're missin'? Come on now. You can't even make a decision yet. Come on! It's all right, fellas, keep workin'. Keep working. Play through. Good job, everybody. Good to see you. Right here, you look at that, some of the best chronic in the city, right there. We get that to local dispensaries and we get it at a discount. That's legal. Sticky icky icky, you know what that is. And right over here... ...you know, that's the uh, pure Bolivian marching powder. A little pick-me-up, you know, when you go to Cancun. Okay. You got your pharmaceuticals in case you, you know, you need to do your homework, you need to focus up. And over right there... There. That's the US currency, man, that's the fruit of your labors. That's gonna go right in our pockets. This is uh... ...this is modern-day slavery. I would-- I wouldn't call it "slavery". Come on now. I-- I would call it um, you know, let's called is "free labor". It's the American way. Think about it. All right. Come on, come on. Why are you showin' me all this? Because I want you to be the first top dog to enjoy all the full perks of your labor. All right? Why not? You know why. Think about it. You good? Yeah. You good? I'm gonna think about it. - Yeah, there you go. - Just think about it. Ruminate on it. Good job, fellas. Keep-- keep playin' through. Good work, everybody. Come on in. I want you to take a look at something. Come on, over here. Can you-- excuse me. Can you show this to him, please? I want you to take a look at this right here. Take a good look, okay? You wanted justice-- All right, for the guard that saved your life. This is justice right here. Take a look. Okay? I want you to know that I am here for you. There's nothin' I won't do for you. I wanna show you that I am loyal to those people that are loyal to me. Sir. Nobody goes this far. Understand? Well. I just want my daughter. Okay, we're gonna get your daughter. Yeah? Yeah. I'm-- I'm here for you. - I am loyal. - Yeah. This is loyalty. Mmhmm. Cover that up. Come on in. I'll-- I'll wait back here. I'm done with this. You're done... ...when we say you're done. Have a seat. Fuck is goin' on? Yeah, that's right. What the fuck? Sorry, it uh, took me a minute to respond to your last text, but I-- I figured it'd be better if we all got together and spoke in person. Now I thought you said he'd be willing to go all the way. Oh, he will be. This was uh-- it's all a game, hmm? You see, my good friend, the commissioner and myself-- Oh yeah, we're good friend. We're gonna split this whole thing 50-50, all right? And I wanted to cut you in on the profit, but you didn't want any part of it. Really too bad, because it's quite profitable. Yeah. Especially, when you add the gambling ring that we run and seven other private prisons in nearby counties, pitting top dogs against our top dog. And you're our top dog now. You work for us. Hell, you exceeded expectations. I even won the wager. Oh, come on, really? I thought you forgot about that. -Come on, give it up. -Uh, dammit. Give it up. Rub it in, huh, Harvey? There we go. Okay. I'm done-- done with this. Now I knew he'd go soft on us. Uh-huh? That's why I got a plan B for your ass. Well, how about that? Bring him in here. No! Bones. Damn, that's gotta-- Okay! Okay! Okay, I'll fight. Okay? Get 'em out of here, both of 'em. Stand up, soldier. Stand up. Finally. Move. Told you he was the man. God, I hope so. I'll call the warden at the Aurora State Prison, get his top dog for a rematch. Good. Good. Now I gotta get out of here. All right. I can't be seen hangin' around with an evil man like you. Give me a break. Got an image. Yeah, I could take lessons from you, you little freak. You're the goddamn devil. Fuck. Well, that electricity, man, that's a mood modifier for your ass. You can't argue with it. Look, man, now you know they ain't gonna let you go. You know that, right? I know. So what in the hell you gonna do, man? It's time to burn this motherfucker down. Thank you for letting me do this. We're all in. I'm surprised you called me. You have something I can use to help you? That's all you need. What is this? You should leave now. What? Leave now. Leave now! - Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight! - Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight! Nothing like a good rematch. I got the whole damn ring. Useless cake. I can't tell you how much I have waited to do this. Who is this? This is my top dog, man. No, no, no. W-- what about the rematch that we agreed on? This is-- What-- The fighter from last time, where is he? Uh, well, Chaka here transferred in three nights ago and he killed my last top dog two nights ago. What the fuck, man? Come on-- come-- now come on. What the fuck what? What in the name of Wakanda is this shit? This is a different weight class right here. He's not right for me, okay? This is my fighter, my top dog. Take it or leave it. Or forfeit, and I'll gladly take my $100,000, and we'll go back to our prison. You're an evil bastard, all right? Uh, evil just runs here. I don't have a choice, do I? All right, bring book, let's do it. Come on. Fuck you. Welcome back to the dungeon, family! Now, now, now, I know you know that tonight is a very special night. We are here for the finale fight. We have our hometown brother Savage! - Savage! Savage! Savage! Savage! - Savage! Savage! Savage! Savage! Savage! Savage! Savage! Savage! All right, all right, all right, all right! Now on the opposin' corner, this poser here, coming from the Aurora Penitentiary when they got some sweet, silk sheets night, his name is Chaka! - Boo! Boo! Boo! Boo! Boo! Boo! - Boo! Boo! Boo! Boo! Boo! Boo! Boo! Boo! Boo! Boo! Boo! Hey, good luck to your fighter today. Fuck you, Super Mario. Get goin', let's fight! - Yeah! Savage! Savage! Savage! - Savage! Savage! Savage! Savage! There are no rules! - Savage! Savage! Savage! Savage! - Savage! Savage! Savage! Savage! Ha-ha! Come on. Looks like you don't even have a chance! Come on. Come up with something. Come on, baby, let's go. Dig deep! There you go. What the fuck! Wooh! Die! I'll be back. Let's go! Wooh! Fuckin' get 'em, boys! We can't have a bloodbath. You and the commissioner assured me this was a safe zone! I have no idea what's goin' on here! You set me up! You think that I would sabotage our entire fuckin' operation? Get the fuck out of there. Go, get the fuck out. Freeze! Everybody, get on the fucking ground! Get out of here. Drop the weapon, guard! Fuck. It's me and you now, motherfucker. No, it's just me, motherfucker. You're in the system now and you leave when I say you leave. Now it's time to fucking go. You all right? Yes. You did it. Well done, bro. Freeze! Fuck you! Oh! You know who the fuck I am? Hey! Hey! Hey! Look at me, motherfucker. I ain't goin' nowhere! Nowhere! I'm the fuckin' law. You'll be in fucking lockdown! I'll be back, boy! I am the fuckin' law! Get your fuckin'-- get off! Get down, get down! Hands up, hands up! Hands, hands! Let me see your hands! Why am I in here and is this shit over with yet? I was able to use the video on the chip you gave me to get the state authorities involved and to bring the corruption in this facility to their attention. And I think you should know, the commissioner, he's in custody, too. You see it's hard to regulate these corporate prison institutions. We just have no control over these private penitentiaries, so your evidence pushes the case for regulation. I mean regardless of what the men inside these walls have done, they're still human beings and they deserve to be treated as such. The state has also agreed to give you a full pardon. I-- I coordinated with the secretary's office for you to be released today. Thank you. The state has also agreed to take care of your daughter's medical costs. I mean it's the least they can do for you, right? Maybe. Do you need a ride? Yeah, I do. Just gotta say goodbye to someone. Sure. - Okay? - Yeah. Just want you to know I appreciate you, OG. I can't even say thank you for what you gave me, man. Gave you? If it wasn't for you, I wouldn't be goin' home with my daughter right now. If it wasn't for you, I wouldn't care if I was alive. That's what you gave me. The will to wanna be alive again. Something that I can't even say thank you for. Just don't forget about a brother when you get to the outside, you know? Send somebody back for me. My word. Stay safe, marine. - Savage! Savage! Savage! Savage! - Savage! Savage! Savage! Savage! Savage! Savage! Savage! Savage! Savage! Savage! Savage! Savage! Savage! Savage! Savage! Savage! Savage! Savage! Savage! Savage! Savage! Savage! Savage! Yeah! Is my grandmother coming? I've been looking for you. Daddy! Looking everywhere for you. You left something. Okay, let's get you home. Clifford Chambers? Yes. Terry Savage sent me to come back for you and uh, someone named "Freeway". Hey! Fuck you looking at? I'm a goddamn warden! I got eyes everywhere, motherfuckers, you hear me? Oh God, this ain't real! It ain't real! Hey, let me out. The fuck you waitin' for? You know I own this place! I own it! I own this shit! Law, help me! Help!
