The love crazy Meera . . . a trinity of love, worship, and faith . . . lived all her life worshiping Girdhar Gopal. From the age of five till her last breath . . . she kept craving for her unseen beloved. Maybe that is why her dried tears turned her land of birth . . . her land of love, Rajasthan, into a land of dry sands. She made everyone there devoted to Shyam. Her unique love brimmed with such devotion . . . it is carrying along devotees in its stream since the last five centuries. And will continue to do so for aeons. ''Whatever this world may say'' ''However it may weigh love'' ''So what if I am away from you'' ''Only your image floats in my eyes'' ''Shyam, Shyam, O my Shyam'' ''O my Shyam, Ghanshyam'' ''I have not seen any dawn'' ''The world has given me such darkness'' ''I don't know what to do'' ''If the world is bad'' ''Cry in private'' ''So what if I am far away from you?'' ''Only your image floats in my eyes'' ''Shyam, Shyam, O my Shyam'' ''O my Shyam, Ghanshyam'' ''How do I say I adore him?'' ''How do I hide even if I want to?'' ''My state is such, that I am restless'' ''Why is the world spewing poison, let what has to happen, happen now'' ''So what if I am far away from you?'' ''Only your image floats in my eyes'' ''Shyam, Shyam, O my Shyam'' ''O my Shyam, Ghanshyam'' Oh great! My daughter gets up early. What can I do, grandpa? My Girdhar gets up early. You only tell me, how can I sleep then? Is it? - Yes. I have to do so much for him. Bathe him, apply sandal wood paste. . . dress him up, offer oblation. Girdhar has domesticated my little daughter. That's true. Now go, I have to arrange oblation for Girdhar. If I get late, he will get angry. What will I do then? Okay, I am leaving. But I had come to tell what my Meera would like to hear. If it is what Girdhar wants to hear, say it. Today is the festival of Girdhar's dance with maidens. Really grandpa? ''Like Radha got Kishin'' ''My heart desires even I get a beau like him'' ''I dance with joy'' ''The flute plays, the drums play, the dot shines on my forehead'' ''Like Radha got Kishin'' ''My heart will bloom'' ''I will find my dreamworld'' ''My anklets tinkle'' ''Even my heart is rejoicing today'' ''I dance with joy . . . '' ''Even I will be a bride one day'' ''I will wear the veil and sit in a palanquin'' ''My bangles ring'' ''My earrings swing slowly'' ''I dance with joy . . . '' We are very fortunate that you sanctified our estate . . . with the touch of the sacred Girdhar . . . and also blessed me and my subjects with the viewing of today's festival. It is all thanks to Girdhar Gopal. This performance was not pre-planned. We were going to Vrindavan. Girdhar inspired us to stop here. One's life is accomplished only by his blessing and inspiration. Acharya, I want to ask you something. - Yes? Meera is a little girl, but she is always lost in the worship of Girdhar. I tried my best, but could not divert her attention. Can the heart be separated from the body? I don't understand. If Girdhar wishes, you will understand very soon. I take your leave. My Girdhar Gopal ! Where are you, Girdhar Gopal? Where did you leave me and go? My darling ! Girdhar Gopal left us, grandpa. Acharya must have taken Girdhar's idol along with the other idols by mistake. It will come back. Don't cry. - No, I want Girdhar Gopal. The idol will come back. Girdhar Gopal, you will have to come back. Madhav, how far have we come from Maidta? Only a furlong. - Madav, stop the cart. As you wish. Hail Lord Krishna ! Girdhar Gopal, you will have to come back. Acharya, you? - I had to come back, Raoji. You will remember, I told you something that day. That the heart cannot be separated from the body. Yes, but I had not understood what you meant. Come, you will even understand that today. Meera. Girdhar Gopal, you will have to come back. Oh God ! Meera, look who is here. Meera, Acharya has come. Acharya, where is my Girdhar Gopal? He is always close to you, dear. Take, my little Radha. You came back? You had to come back. Let me see where you run and go now. Will you be able to carry it? Shall I keep it in the temple for you? I can carry it. If I don't carry him, who will carry my Girdhar Gopal? Alright, take it carefully. Hold here. Go. Girdhar, don't ever leave me and go again. I understand what you said that day now, Acharya. Meera has become a part of Girdhar. Truly, no one can separate Meera from Girdhar. Then why don't you surrender Meera to Girdhar &amp; stop worrying about her? There is no time to think now. This kid born as your granddaughter . . . is one of the infinite beloveds of Girdhar, a form of Radha. Yes. O Girdhar Gopal, I hand over Meera to you. Your devotee has become free of responsibility forever. Meera belongs to you from now. She belongs to Girdhar Gopal. ''Girdhar Gopal belongs to me'' ''How do I live without him?'' ''I have to live and die with him'' ''Girdhar Gopal belongs to me . . . '' ''I don't feel at peace even for a moment'' ''My eyes don't like anyone else'' ''He has such an innocent face'' ''That no one else impresses my heart'' ''Don't leave me and go'' ''Girdhar Gopal belongs to me . . . '' ''How desperate I am, I cannot say'' ''If I don't see you, I feel restless'' ''I don't care if I lose the world'' ''But I will not be able to tolerate separation from him'' ''Don't ever leave me and go'' ''Girdhar Gopal belongs to me . . . '' ' Girdhar, you are my Prince' ' Don't ever leave me' Meera, O crazy lover! Good you came, Lalita. I'll recite a new couplet to you. He just gave it to me. I will hear the couplet, first you listen to me. What is it that has become even more important than my Girdhar's couplet? Okay, tell me. - Your father has come. I heard your uncle has called him specially. So? The moment he came, they went into discussion in a room. So? What so? You are always lost in Girdhar. You just don't care what's going on in the world. Why should I worry? Alright, but your father has come after so many days. Won't you meet him? - Shall I tell you the truth, friend? Except Girdhar, I don't even feel like meeting anyone now. If father was alive today, he would be pleased to hear this news. Yes brother, father only brought up Meera, gave her an education. I am her father only in name. Meera is our most favourite daughter, Rattan. When I got this message of Rana Sangram Singh . . . I could not believe it for a moment. Because he has even proposed to make you the chief of Mewad. Yes. He must have made the proposal after due thought. The throne of Chittor is the prestige of the Rajputanas. Likewise, even our Rathod clan is the prestige of the Rajputs. The estate of Maidta may be small, but we are not small in our bravery. Yes, but what we have to think about is by building ties with us . . . is the Rana of Mewad playing some political game? I have heard a lot of politics is being played in Chittor. There are differences even between the Queens there. Will our Meera have any . . . No one can change what is destined, brother. But if we build ties and make Mewad stronger . . . it will be in the interest of the Rajputanas. So even you wish that we accept Rana's proposal? And send him our consent? - Yes brother. I think we must consult Meera once in this matter. What are you saying, brother! After father, Meera has grown up under you. Whatever you do will be in her interest. She cannot refuse you. Alright, then I'll send our consent to Rana. Come. - Yes brother. Respected Rana, the pride of the Rajputs . . . the scion of the Surya clan . . . the King of Mewad, Rana Sangram Singh . . . Viramdev Rao of Maidta sends his greetings. You have honoured us Rathods of Maidta, . . . by asking for our daughter's hand in marriage. We are grateful to you for it. We give our consent to your proposal. Fix an auspicious date and inform us. Yours, Rao Viramdev. Minister, I am pleased that Rao Viramdev accepted our proposal. But Ranaji, Maidta is a small estate of 360 village. And Meera's father is the chief of only 12 villages But building ties with them, the prestige of Mewad . . . Is getting a boost, minister. I am confident that the daughter of Maidta will be my daughter-in-law. . . and even their sword will become our friend. Ask the priest to give us an auspicious date. I'd myself like to go to Maidta and perform the rituals. As you wish, Ranaji. Did you hear correctly, Uda? - Now hear this! You think your daughter has gone deaf? It's not that. What I'm surprised about is that without consulting me . . . Rana fixed Bhojraj's alliance with the daughter of Maidta. Watch what happens next. The alliance is being fixed today. The marriage will happen tomorrow. Next, Bhojraj will take the throne. And then, we all will be thrown out of the palace. Everything is possible. What is this, Vikram? You cannot even stand properly. When his heart is on fire, this is the only way to douse it. Poor brother! - Don't call me poor! the throne will go to this worthless son. Bless you, Vikram. Your sister and my hopes are pinned on you. The day you become King. . . your mother will become the Queen Mother. And what will become of your sister, Future King? Whatever you wish. Let me become King first. Why do you worry? The throne is yours. Whatever hurdle comes in your way is sure to be crushed. Wish your words come true, sister. Careful, brother. Sir. . . - How dare you show that to me! I'm dead ! My Master, first hit me with this. That's okay, but why have you covered your face? What happened to you? - First beat me with this, sir. Beat me. Enough sir! - Now tell me what happened. I could not do the job you assigned me. - What! I went to the ladies quarters wearing a veil, to give your message to Champa. But the maids recognised me and hit me . . . with whatever they could lay their hands on. Some with a broom, some with a stick, and some with shoes. Not only that, they even said that if ever I go to their quarters . . . wearing a veil, they will behead me. But by your grace, your Dayaram Panda's life was saved. That means from tomorrow, I'll have to make some other arrangement. No sir, I'll arrange Champa for you. But without wearing the veil. Okay sir. ' Dwell in my eyes, Nandlal' ' You, who holds the flute to your lips' ' And wears a garland of flowers round your neck' ' Dwell in my eyes, Nandlal' Why are you panting, Lalita? For who are the cannons being fired? - In honour of Rana Sangram Singh. Do you know, he is coming with the marriage token. Your marriage has been fixed with Prince Bhojraj. What? My marriage? But my marriage has been fixed in my childhood . . . with Girdhar Gopal. No, these cannons are not being fired in anyone's honour . . . but to kill someone's husband. This is not possible! Grandpa ! Grandpa, look what is happening. How can such a disaster take place? The forehead that already shines with someone else's vermilion . . . isn't it injustice to apply another man's vermilion on the same forehead? Isn't it a sin? Answer me, grandpa. Speak! Why don't you speak? Don't you remember that you only had surrendered me to Girdhar? You only had made me his wife. Speak grandpa ! Don't you remember anything? Anything? I remember, dear. I remember everything. Really grandpa? Then stop this disaster from happening. Please stop it. - This is not a disaster, dear. It is normal societal norm. Every girl gets married. Even you will. That means you don't remember anything, grandpa. It is you who is forgetting, dear. Because you were very little then. Acharya had told me a strange secret. He told me you are one of Krishna's infinite beloveds . . . a form of Radha. And. . . And despite knowing this, this injustice is being done to me? It is not injustice, dear. Even Radha was Krishna's friend like you. She was his beloved. She totally belonged to Girdhar. She didn't marry Girdhar, but someone else. Her heart always belonged to Girdhar. And physically, she belonged to her husband. Even your heart can always belong to Gopal after marriage. So is this your order? - Not order dear, it is my blessing. May you be blessed. May you always be happy. I looked for you everywhere. What are you doing here, dear? I was seeking grandpa's blessing for a good beginning to my new life. I know dear, how much a girl misses her mother on such occasions. If your mother was alive today . . . Grandpa and uncle's love never let me miss anything. You sired me. But it is the land of Maidta that gave me my culture. Don't say that, dear. Ratan had sent you to Maidta with a heavy heart. He is so unfortunate, death snatched his wife from him. Circumstances separated his only child from him. He didn't see your childhood, but yes, he'll now see you married. Be happy wherever you are. Uncle, I will get married, but you give me a promise. Tell me, dear. Don't ever separate me from my Girdhar Gopal. Take my life if you like, but don't ever separate me from Girdhar Gopal. I am sure Rana will not have any problem about that. ''Leaving her parents home, the maiden will join her husband'' ''When her husband comes to meet her, she will shy away under her veil'' ''She will get so much love, she will forget us'' ''Leaving her parents home . . . '' ''Wherever I may go . . . '' ''always be with me, Girdhar'' ''I don't know anyone else'' ''I belong to you in my every life'' ''I cannot live without you even for a moment, what do I do?'' ''Wherever I may go . . . '' ''always be with me, Girdhar'' ''Why are you crying, send her away'' ''A daughter has to leave one day'' ''I had to hide the pain in my heart'' ''I didn't want to leave, but I had to'' My dear. Prince, if my Meera makes any mistake, please forgive her. Because something may always be amiss in the rearing of a motherless child. Meera is a very naive girl, take care of her. Why do you worry about me, father? The one who takes care of me is with me. Him. Queen, you are being called. The prince and his bride has come. Okay! If the bride waits a little, her legs won't break. Go. Come mother. Welcome sister-in-law. - Come, daughter-in-law. Prince, come to the temple first, let's finish the rituals. Yes. Come bride. Daughter-in-law, why did you stop? - Prince, come along with the bride. . . and worship the family deity. Come. - No. What does this refusal mean? Without worshiping the family deity, . . . the bride cannot enter the palace, dear. Come and worship her. But. . . but Girdhar Gopal is not in this temple. And I don't worship without the presence of Girdhar Gopal. You worship him everyday. But this is your first visit to the family deity's temple. Come. Such stubbornness will not be tolerated here. Not at all ! Rana, you only make her understand. Her stubbornness will ruin the family. Try to understand, sister-in-law. If the family deity gets annoyed . . . What if my Girdhar gets annoyed? What will I do? Where will I go? No, I won't be able to bear that. You will have to offer prayers. Apart from the family deity, no other idol can be installed here. Meera, I have given you my word. Do what I am saying today. Girdhar Gopal, if my love is true . . . like every prayer I offer, you will be present even in this prayer. Come, Girdhar. Come Shyam Sunder. Hail Lord Krishna ! - Hail Lord Krishna ! My Girdhar, you kept my honour. Come. How did this happen? I think master, instead of a bride, some sorcerer has come into the family. It is a cause for worry for all of us. You are desperate to go in, brother. Let him go. Why are you troubling our Prince? How can I let him go without taking my token from him? I am going to sleep in another room. Good night. Wait. I am not so stupid to let go off my gift. Give me my gift. - Gift? Take. Go and sleep in another room. Let me see how long you can stay away from my beautiful sister-in-law. I'll give you the gift after I've made you an aunt. All that later! First give me my token. Take! - You can go in now. Thank you. Do you intend to stand here all night, brother? Sister-in-law, make him sit somewhere else atleast for today. Why? Why? My brother will answer that for you. Right brother? Having got you, I am jealous of my own destiny. I had never expected to see such a beauty on earth. And that too, so closely. Uda was right. What has God got to do on the nuptial bed? Give, I'll keep it over there. God? No, I am his wife. How can I sleep on this bed without him? Don't I have a right to sit on this bed? Am I not your husband? - No. ' I belong only to Girdhar Gopal, none else' ' One who wears a peacock feather crown, is my husband' And what about the marriage rites you performed with me? My body performed the marriage rites with you. But my heart has, I don't know since how many years, belonged to Girdhar. This is not the time to joke. - Joke? Joke with my Girdhar? I cannot even imagine it. - Your stubbornness won't be tolerated. I have every right to be stubborn for my husband. You should have told us this beforehand. I had said I will not stay away from my Girdhar even for a moment. Wait Prince, why are you leaving? we will leave. My greetings to Prince Bhojraj. Come Panda. How are you? On this auspicious occasion, I only need your blessings. Take. A spell should be such that it leaves one spellbound. One has to bow before miracles. Everyone accepts your wife is great. She is wonderful. That is how devoted one should be. That is how dedicated one should be. Those who were jealous had to bite dust. That is what I was telling Uda, brother. I am very scared. There is no need to be afraid. We have to think of a solution . . . where we can have the cake and eat it too. Uncle, we have only your support now. We never ever expected anything from Rana. What if this sorcerer puts even him under her spell? Didn't you see how Rana was bowing faithfully? And the prince? He has a double spell cast on him. One of her beauty, and the other of her mantras. We have to think how, despite this sorcerer . . . we put Vikram on the throne. How to make Rana understand. What will he understand? He brought the girl from Maidta. He is even planning to make Ratan Singh the Chief of Mewad. The problem is serious, we must be very careful. Before the arrow is released and hits bullseye . . . You will have to think of a solution, uncle. Don't worry, rest assured. Karmavati, I will be worthy of being your brother . . . when I make my nephew, Vikram sit on the Mewad throne. God willing, even that day will come. Why are you laughing so much? What is the matter? Poor brother! - Who are you talking about? Bhojraj. - Why, what happened to him? No! - Ask Ramvati. She actually saw it. Ramvati, tell her. Tell mother who sleeps with Meera. - Girdhar. That same magical idol. - Is it? Push harder. . . harder. Stop. . .stop! Yes mother? - Did Meera apply henna? What do I say? She is swinging with him. Tell her we have a festival tomorrow. We have to even go to the temple after afternoon.Ask her to come &amp; apply henna As you wish. I'll tell her. Leela, apply henna for me. Lalita, stop. Sister-in-law, applied henna? I didn't get a good colour. Show me yours. ' Girdhar written all over her hands' ''I will immerse myself in Girdhar's colour'' ''Even I will be like Radha'' ''My home will be in Vrindavan'' ''Where I'll live along with my Natwar'' ''I dance with joy'' ''The flute plays, the drums play, the dot shines on my forehead'' ''Like Radha got Kishin'' ''My heart desires even I get a beau like him'' Why are you looking at her like thieves, Bhojraj? She belongs to you, she is your wife. You have a right over her. Go take your right. Go win your wife's body. Go Bhojraj. She belongs to you. . .you ! It's probably my imagination. What were you about to do, Bhojraj? You were going to challenge God? You were going to burn your hands with the rays of the sun? No, Meera doesn't belong to you. She is that sacred pilgrimage . . . seeing which, worshiping which, sins of several lives can be erased. Hail Lord Krishna ! ''I will sit in my beloved's palanquin all dressed up'' ''I will belong to my beloved in all my lives'' ''This dream of mine will come true'' ''My eyes will brim with happiness'' ''I will sit in my beloved's palanquin all dressed up . . . '' ''He will be unique'' ''The light of my lonely heart'' ''My eyes are desperate'' ''To see that innocent face'' ''There will only be love in my life'' ''Whatever he says will be acceptable to me'' ''I will sit in my beloved's palanquin all dressed up . . . '' ''I will win over my mother-in-law's heart'' ''I will treat my sister-in-law as my sister'' ''My father-in-law will be very loving'' ''I will serve him as my daughter'' ''My world will be full of happiness'' ''Love is what I'll adorn myself with'' ''I will sit in my beloved's palanquin all dressed up . . . '' Master, you have so many maids in your palace. But not one of them who can show some mercy on your Dayaram Panda. Stupid ! A woman loves, she doesn't show mercy. That is what I am saying. I love so many, but none love me. You ass! A woman loves only when she sees something in you. The shine of money, machismo. Ask this from Champa. Okay Master, I am leaving. - Go. Master, I am leaving. - Then go. My feet have got stuck, Master. - You are a rascal ! They are free now. I'm leaving. Listen Dayaram, tell Champa I have called her. I'll have to go to the women's quarters again? So what? Are you going the first time? Wear a veil and go. No Master, I will not wear a veil and go. I understand, Master. I'll do something. Wife! . . .Wife! Come soon. - Let me clean the temple first. Do that later. Come. Where are you taking me? - Come, I'll show you a miracle. Miracle? But what's the hurry? Come soon. - Wait. Where are you taking me? Hey! Where did it go? - What? I just saw a huge temple descending from heaven. And I saw your Girdhar Gopal entering it. But sadly, you could not see it. Wonder where that strange sight disappeared like a dream. It has not disappeared, I can still see it. Why can't I see it? Oh, I understood. - What? That you can see everything with your Girdhar's divine sight. Not everything, only Girdhar Gopal. My eyes see only Girdhar Gopal. The truth is, they don't even want to see anything else. I have a thought. - What? I'll get a similar temple built for Girdhar . . . like the one I saw just now. - Really? Yes. Prince, any specific reason for bringing me here? Yes Rana, I want your permission. I want to get a temple made of Girdhar Gopal. Your daughter-in-law wishes the same. A temple of Girdhar Gopal? Alright. If that is what you and daughter-in-law wish . . . I have no objection. But where do you want the temple made? The land over there. - That land? No, that is not the temple of my imagination. Show me some other design. - Then see this, Prince. You will surely like this design. Yes, that's the one! I'll just be back. Wife. Yes Prince. Look, isn't this the same temple? - Yes, exactly the same. When will the temple be ready? - Soon. That's what I'll try. Are you happy? Yes, me, and my Girdhar too. Isn't it? The construction of the temple should be stopped soonest. How can it be stopped? It is being constructed on the orders of Rana. Wonder why Rana is pampering sister-in-law's so much. Whose father has become his right hand man . . . it is natural he will pamper his daughter. As it is, the several battles are emptying Chittor's coffers. Moreover, this temple. Money is being spent lavishly. If this continues, we will have to go begging. I'd advise you to ask for a separate estate for your children from Rana. Uncle is right. - But brother. . . If we get a separate estate, we'll find a way to capture Mewad. Your children are still young. Try to convince Rana. If nothing is done now, Vikram won't get a chance to become Rana. Yes mother. Alright, I'll place my demand before Rana today. Just placing a demand won't do. You will have to ensure it is fulfilled. If you show even a little softness our future will be dark. Have faith Vikram, I will try my best. Queen ! I am surprised how you dared to keep such a proposal before me. You are aware what all I am doing to consolidate Mewad . . . and strengthen it's unity. At such a time when we should fight the enemies of Mewad, you. . . you want to divide Mewad? If Mewad is in trouble. . . why is the money in our coffers being spent on useless activities? Is there a dearth of temples in Chittor . . . that you gave permission for constructing one more temple? Where the money of Mewad has to be spent . . . is not your prerogative Queen, it is mine. Alright, then isn't it my prerogative to ensure . . . the women of Mewad, forgetting their family traditions . . . crossing the threshold of their homes . . . not start dancing and singing before people? Oh ! So why don't you clearly say that it is not the temple . . . but Meera's worship that is bothering you. . But remember, I have promised her . . . that no one will separate her from her Girdhar Gopal. If anyone tries to break my promise until I am alive . . . he should also be ready to suffer the consequences. You understand, Queen? You can leave now. Mother, crying won't help you. Think of something, do something. What do I do, Uda? I don't understand what I should do. Don't worry Uda, when her brother explains, she'll understand everything. Come, Mahajan. Greetings Queen. Don't hesitate, sister. He is our well wisher. He is famous in the whole of Mewad for his wiseness. I suggest that even Vikram follow his advise. Uncle, I will do as you say. Mahajan has become our trustworthy advisor from this moment. So, when can you spare time for us? Why ask? I am at your service from this moment. But remember, let Mahajan's coming here remain a secret. Alright, but what advise do you give? - A small task, Queen. The idol that is causing all the problems . . . what if that itself goes missing? You are right, but if Rana gets a whiff of it . . . If I was not good at my job, why would I be famous? Just hear me without any worry. Careful. Careful Panda. Let's go. Mahajan has never failed until today. Nor he ever will. Where did he go? Prince! Get up! - What happened? Have you seen my Girdhar Gopal? He was with you. - He was, but . . . Then where can he go? - Where do I look for my Girdhar? Lalita, get up! Where did my Girdhar Gopal go? Did you see him? No. - Where did he leave me and go? Give. . .quick! Is anyone watching? No. Enough ! How will the flute be played now without the flute? Prince Vikram unnecessarily gets worried. I can . . . What's happening? Run ! O Girdhar Gopal, don't ever leave me again. Rest assured. Dayaram and Mahajan will come with the good news. Disaster! Master, disaster! What happened? We cannot believe even after seeing that such a thing can happen. But what happened? Didn't I tell you Master, that the Prince's wife is a sorcerer? We realized today that the idol she calls Girdhar . . . Is not Girdhar's idol. - It is a magic idol. We buried it deep in the ground. But it ripped open the ground and came out. We somehow managed to save our lives and come here. So has that idol come back? - Ofcourse. Yes Master. Suraj, I can't believe this is possible. Everything is possible with black magic. We will have to deal with this magic with magic. Congratulations! Your temple is ready. Really? - Yes. Your temple is ready. The installation will also be done today. Rana has sent me to bring the idol. ''Forgetting all norms, I tie anklets to my feet'' ''I surrender everything, my Girdhar is here! '' ''Wearing peacock feathers, I will dance with abandon'' ''My craving of years has been satiated'' ''My world is brimming with happiness today'' ''I once again desire to live'' ''Girdhar in my body, Girdhar in my soul'' ''Girdhar all around me'' ''Wearing peacock feathers, I will dance with abandon'' ''Mohan's flute has begun to play again'' ''It is echoing in my every sinew'' ''I have his name on my lips'' ''Wearing peacock feathers, I will dance with abandon . . . '' Great mother! The honour of our family . . . on the pretext of this temple, has begun to dance outside the palace! My head hangs in shame. Bless you. You called me, Rana? Yes Bhojraj. I. . . want to discuss something about Meera. Yes? - I'm not saying she should not worship That she should not sing hymns. I have no objection. But she should not forget she belongs to the royal family of Mewad. She is the Queen in waiting. Dancing before the subjects is not done. It is very shameful for us. This should not happen again. Yes. Wife, I respect your feelings. I also accept that you don't belong to me, but to Girdhar Gopal. That is an understanding between us. It is our private secret. Private matters of the royal family reaching the eyes &amp; ears of subjects. . . is against the family norms. It is not proper. What do you mean? You understood correctly. Not only me, even Rana didn't like . . . that the royal queen, wearing anklets in her feet . . . sing and dance before the subjects. Prince, high and low class and creed are all man made divisions. In Girdhar's temple, there is no discrimination. Whoever goes there, is just a beggar begging for Girdhar's mercy. All are equal. All of them have a right to worship him. That means you won't listen to me? Why not? But it should be something that can be followed. Tell me, just to follow your orders, should I annoy my Girdhar? Hail Girdhar Gopal ! I'm not saying she should not worship. That she should not sing hymns. But she should not forget she belongs to the royal family of Mewad. She is the Queen in waiting. Dancing before the subjects is not done. It is very shameful for us. This should not happen again. Even Rana didn't like . . . that the royal queen, wearing anklets in her feet . . . sing and dance before the subjects. Prince, high and low class and creed are all man made divisions. All of them have a right to worship Girdhar. That means you won't listen to me? Why not? But it should be something that can be followed. Tell me, just to follow your orders, should I annoy my Girdhar? What dilemma have I got myself into? Who do I listen to, and who not? Master! - Do you always have to disturb me? Master, you always start scolding the moment you see me. I'd brought good news. - What good news? Bhojraj has developed fever. Fever? Is that good news? It can be turned into good news. Right, Mahajan? - Absolutely. How is that? But. . . One must be prepared to do anything to get power. That's politics. Take rest now, wife. - I am not tired to go and rest. Are you feeling better? Your hand is no ordinary hand. Your Girdhar Gopal's blessing is hidden in it. How can pain stay then? Tell me something. - Yes? Do you have any complaints, any sorrow, any . . . Prince, the sacrifice you have made for me . . . only a great soul can make that sacrifice. You gave up the right of of a husband . . . and made Meera Girdhar's eternal wife. Even several lives will be less to repay this debt. Don't embarrass me. Go make the bed for your Girdhar. Or he won't sleep. - First you sleep, the I will leave. I will sleep. The fever has subsided now. You leave. But . . . - Don't worry. The physician is going to come now. Go and take rest. What do you want? Give me the medicine you have brought. Prince Vikram, you? - Yes. Give this medicine instead. What is this? - Poison. No, I cannot do that. I am the royal physician. I cannot be disloyal. I cannot commit this sin. Then even your son won't see tomorrow's dawn. Think again. On one hand is this small job . . . and on the other is your son's life. Take, physician. Oh God, forgive me. Madam, come quickly! The Prince's health is deteriorating. Rana has called you. Prince. . . Prince. Prince. . .open your eyes. Look, your wife has come. Wife. - Yes? I am leaving. Your Girdhar Gopal willed that. I am leaving you under his care. Hail Girdhar Gopal ! My son ! - Why did you leave us? Whatever Girdhar wills. Uncle, I fear the physician may reveal everything. That has been taken care of. Both father and son were poisoned. . . and pushed in the lake last night. The whole story is over now. One hurdle has been removed. Uncle, we have to remove the other hurdle too now Don't worry about Meera, how can she harm you? If she tries something, we'll handle it. Sister-in-law. . . God ! I have never come across such a woman. Your husband's body is lying over there . . . and you are standing at the window all dressed up? You tormented him enough when he was alive. Atleast let his soul rest in peace now. If the world sees you like this, what will they say? Hurry up, his body is about to be cremated. Uda, break her bangles. Wipe her vermilion dot. She won't listen like that. Move ahead and break her bangles! No one can eliminate Meera's husband. Shut-up! Your stubbornness won't be tolerated now, understand ! Meera is the wife of Girdhar Gopal. Girdhar's eternal wife. No one can eliminate her husband, not even Girdhar himself. Uda, tell Rana and make arrangements for her to be cremated with the Prince. Let her story end here. Everyone has to get cremated, mother. Even I will. But the Prince will have to go alone today. Why? You claim yourself to be a great devotee. Don't you know that a husband and wife bond is eternal? The wife follows her husband. When the husband dies, the wife has to die too. That's our tradition. - That is what even I'm saying. The wife follows her husband. Where there is Girdhar, Meera will follow I will tell Rana about your deeds! Your darling Meera has brought the royal family shame. Whoever sees her dressed as a bride, laughs at us . . . slings mud at the royal family. There is no point in telling him anything. Even he can see it all. Rana, I ask you the last time. . . is allowing a widow to live as a married woman according to tradition? Is all this acceptable to you? Pardon me for interrupting, Rana. I myself don't want to live in the palace now. I feel suffocated here. Then where does my daughter want to live? Under my Girdhar's shadow And his shadow exists in every place of pilgrimage, every temple . . . the heart of every devotee. Is that your final decision? It is not my decision, it is the will of Girdhar Gopal. Okay then child, Girdhar's will is undeniable. Arrangements will be made for your pilgrimage.

''Where do I go leaving you?'' ''Tell me that'' ''You are Krishna. . . '' Where are you going? Go back. I plead with you, go back. Is this Goswami's ashram? - That's why I'm asking you to go back. You cannot meet him. - Why? Is he meditating? - No, but women are not allowed here. Reason? - Guruji is a celibate man. He stays away even from the shadow of women. Is it? Does he consider himself man? Why? Isn't a celibate, a man? I think there is only one man in the world. One greatest man. Apart from him, Meera doesn't know, nor accept anyone else as a man. So brother, go and tell Goswami, that Meera doesn't meet any man. . . other than Girdhar. ' I belong only to Girdhar Gopal, none else' ' One who wears a peacock feather crown, is my husband' Pardon me mother, this fool made a grave mistake. The knowledge you imparted, only a great soul can impart it. Get up. Goswami. To err is human. I will leave your feet only after you have forgiven me. Girdhar Gopal is the one who forgives. Now don't be stubborn. I have moved ahead on my path. I will not turn back now. Greetings. - Bless you. What news have you brought from Chittor? I have bad news. Since you left Chittor . . . it has become an ill-fated land. Rana Sangram Singh and your father, Rao Ratan Singh, died in a battle. Whatever Girdhar wills. Chittor was attacked again. All the brave men jumped into the battleground. And they all were martyred. How is Queen Karmavati? Along with all the other Rajputani women of Chittor . . . even she sacrificed her life in the pyre of her husband. Even that is Girdhar's will. But the people of Chittor wish that you return to Chittor. Due to your good deeds, good luck will return to Chittor. Girdhar's empty temple, on getting back its idol,will bring back happiness Please don't refuse, Queen. Don't refuse, this is the tormented call of the people of Chittor. Please save Chittor. I take your leave. ''Girdhar Gopal belongs to me'' ''How do I live without him?'' ''I have to live and die with him'' ''Girdhar Gopal belongs to me . . . '' Years ago, when this sorcerer left Chittor . . . I thought God has saved our family honour. is related to me. But, by starting all the drama again, she has reminded me everything. My sleep, hunger, thirst, this woman has snatched everything. And Master, this time, she has returned with the support of the people If you try and make her leave by force . . . the people can rebel. When you have me, why do you worry so much, Rana? I am seeing you worried since many days. I thought I'll bring along a solution to it today. This is poison. A poison so strong, even one drop can prove fatal. What are you saying ! - Don't think about what after this. I will have her body disposed in such a manner, that no one will know. That's okay, but this task is not as simple as you think. Why do you think like that when you have Dayaram Panda? Dayaram, will you be able to do this job? Rana has sent this sacred water for you. He said it is from Chatur Bhuj sent by your aunt from Maidta. Sacred water from Chatur Bhuj? - Yes. May I leave? - Yes. No, don't drink that. - Why? He was Rana's well wisher. I know. But whatever has been given to me as sacred water . . . I cannot disrespect it. I will consider it the sacred water of Girdhar and drink it. Madam look, Girdhar's idol has turned blue. What nonsense are you talking ! That impostor drank the poison and Girdhar turned blue? That she is not a woman, she is Goddess? I witnessed it myself, Master. I understand this pretense, these miracles, very well. No one can save that brazen woman from me. That Girdhar is a small idol, like a toy. Don't make that mistake, son. We were naive to assume her divine powers to be magical powers. But . . . ' I belong only to Girdhar Gopal, none else' Lalita, I want to leave this place. Not for the fear of Rana, but due to the sorrow . . . that because of me, my Girdhar had to suffer a lot. Not any more, Girdhar. What are you saying Queen? Will you also leave me. . . Don't call me Queen. Call me Meera, your friend. Our journey together was only until here. Accept it as Girdhar's will and honour it.
