GREEN SHADOW aka "Untouched" INEXHAUSTIBLE SOURCE FOR CORTISONE EXTRACTION DISCOVERED APPARENTLY USELESS BARBASCO ROOTS TURN INTO FEEDSTOCK FOR A GREAT DRUG THE USE OF CORTISONE WILL HELP CURE MUCH OF THE TISSUE AND ARTERY DISEASES OUR INHOSPITABLE TROPICAL FORESTS WILL TURN INTO A SOURCE OF RELIEF FOR THE SICK You see? Barbasco's features are unmistakable. Don't worry. I've studied all there is about this plant. Excellent. I'd like to address some other very important issues with you. Follow me. We've marked the most abundant barbasco areas in this Veracruz state map. This report might be really helpful to you, as it contains essential information along with a draft of the conditions which must be met by the grinding plant. As for purchase prices per ton, we're flexible, depending on the local conditions you may encounter. Means of transport and other things. Even the psychological attitude of the people you'll have to deal with. When should I leave? - As early as tomorrow. - Tomorrow? I didn't expect it to be so soon. - But I'm ready. - Excellent. Any question? Any doubt? No, I believe I have enough information. Then I can only wish you good luck. And hopefully things will turn out as planned. I hope so too. - See you soon. - I'll walk you out. We'll greet the cashier in the process. This is as far as I can go, boss. - Why? - See for yourself. What's that? - It's the feast of Corpus Christi. - Oh. But the people you're looking for are just across the square. - How much do I owe you? - 10 pesos, boss. Thank you. - Do you want me to take you there? - Yes, go ahead. - Where is it? - Right over there. - Good morning, sir. - Good morning. - How can I help you? - I'd like to see the forester. He's not here, sir. He's in Jalapa until next week. You can leave a message if you wish. No, it doesn't matter. I wanted to give him some cover letters to see if he could help me get horses and a guide... Anselmo works with my husband all the time. But the celebrations are a bad time... Where is Anselmo? He's the one standing up there. The captain of the Flying Men. He knows all those routes very well. Much appreciated, madam. Anselmo! I've been told that you'd guide people when they go to the mountains. I'd like you to come with me if possible. It's not possible. Why? I have undertaken to fly on Friday, Saturday and Sunday. Please come back to me on Monday. I cannot wait that long. Today's Thursday, Corpus day. You must wait. I'll pay you well, Anselmo. Just wait. Don't bother, sir. He won't go. He must meet his undertaking or else bad things could happen to him. Do you know of any other who could take me...? It'll be very difficult to find someone willing to go with you. Okay, take me to an hotel then. - There are no rooms available. - What? The festivities, you know. Pineapple juice, please. Do you want one? Two. I see you trust me, sir. If you don't want to wait until Monday, I can take you there. Do you know the area well? As well as Anselmo. And since no rooms are available, we can leave as early as today if you wish. I'll find the animals while you buy provisions. How long will it take to...? It depends on you. If you're a good rider, then three or four days, I reckon. Three or four days? Sounds good. [speaks an indigenous language] [speaks an indigenous language] I can get you all the Barbasco you want. There's plenty in these mountains. If you're interested, we can close the deal right now. Of course I'm interested. But I can't guarantee anything until we decide where to build the grinding plant. This is a good place. But there are no means of transport. If they fix the road, even trucks could use it in the dry season. - Really? - Yeah. Well, then when I get back in two weeks we can get to that. Perfect. Is there a telegraph office in town? Yes, sir. Just around the corner. But it doesn't always work. I hope I'll get lucky. See you. Last village with telegraph. Don't be alarmed if you don't hear from me. Love you and remember you always. Kisses. Federico. If this is for your wife, you seem a bit laconic. For a few more centavos, I'd tell her... No, leave it as it is. Please don't dawdle. The sun will go down on us soon. It's still very early. This is the jungle, boss. Before you know it, darkness begins to fall and stands in our way. What were you doing up there? Nothing, boss. We'd better have a cup of coffee before we keep on moving. What the hell... When will this mist disappear? A strong wind will be needed for that. Did you sleep well? Well, so-so, to be honest. - You didn't let me. - Why? Too much sleep talk. Did I talk in my sleep? What did I say? Several things. Most about "patria" [homeland]. Do you really love it that much? I must have meant "Patricia" instead. Oh yes. I even thought you had a fever. Sometimes I feel like getting back. Getting back? If you want to, it wouldn't be such a bad idea. I'm saying this because... I remember my home... my wife... No, we have to keep going, no matter what. I figured you wanted to get back because you had already grasped what is happening to us. To us? What is happening to us? There is no path around. We've gone astray. - Too much darkness. - You blame darkness now? You never knew this area in the first place. Isn't that so, you fool? Just go easy on me, boss. I know this area because I came here once and also from what they told me about it. Whose hands did just I fall into? And now what? - What are we going to do? - Just let the horses take us back. They know how to find a village better than Christians. And the dung trail they left yesterday might be fresh already. We just need to follow it and we'll arrive soon. Let's saddle the horses. Move! Let it loose! He knows what to do. Down here! Don't do that, boss. They will stick inside even more. I'll take those ticks from you with a little cigar. What did you find up there? I thought it was a trail but it was a shortcut for mountain goats. A shortcut for goats...! Yesterday they were hog tracks. We've been trapped in this hellhole for four days already! It's three day, boss. I've counted them with these little pebbles. What's the use of this, you moron? Let me give you an advice, boss. Now we're the same because the jungle can't tell who's the boss and who's the servant. You'd better treat me nicely so that we both can decide what to do. I'd hate to see us both hit by bad luck. Look out now! You wretch! You wanted to kill me! Shut up! Look you got behind you. I never thought of such a thing. Pedro... Please forgive me. This bloody jungle makes me see threats everywhere. I just need you to know that Pedro Gonz√°lez is not a man who'd kill someone in cold blood... or betray anyone. I realize now. I promise not to mistrust you ever again. That's good, boss. And now we'd better keep moving. When one is lost, there's nothing worse to do than not doing anything at all. Let's go. Don't keep your thoughts for yourself. Feel free to share anything with me anytime. If you keep thinking about a single thing all the time... it will be very hard to fix. The soul of the jungle is a green shadow that takes hold of you. Yes, boss. The green shadow is like a pretty, but wicked girl. Whenever the green shadow hears the astray man say: "I won't make it out of here". The jungle starts seeking revenge. And it starts laughing out loud. But that's only the rustling sound of the trunks. And the bushes and animals that take over your head. What do you mean? It's good to talk things out. You can't let the jungle believe you're done. What is there to talk about? I can only think about what's happening to us. That's the problem, boss. Just tell me anything you want. Where did you meet your wife? Thank you, Pedro. Thanks for caring. You know... I feel guilty about you. I made this trip for an important reason. But what about you? What's in it for you anyway? A few pesos? You're just guiding a stranger for what it's worth. It may not be just that. I have a wife and three children. So many mouths are always hard to feed. But something burnt inside of me. And I felt like enduring the adventure. What's that? - A cougar. - Not a cougar, that hiss! That's what they do. There it is. Come with me... Just try to keep it down. Argh! Boss! Boss! A nauyaca viper bit me! Please tie my leg! Quick! Higher! Tighter, or else the venom will reach my body! What do I do now? You need to suck my wound. Please do it, boss, or else I'll die! Spit the blood out! Spit it out! Give me some. It's over, boss. My time has come. No, don't say that! I'll do anything to cure you. Even if you'd cut off my leg... I'd be hopeless just the same. Don't talk nonsense, Pedro. For heaven's sake, my boss... If I die, don't leave me here. I don't want to be eaten by vultures! Bury me like a Christian. And put at least two sticks as a cross. Nothing's going to happen to you! Please promise me too... that if you survive, you'll give shelter to my wife... and my kids. I promise, Pedro. But you're not going to die. No way! I already feel it, boss. No, Pedro, no...! Take this. So you don't lose count of the days we've been lost. You need to add today's pebble. I had forgotten about it. And take care... ...or else the indians... may come... ...after [...] Pedro... Pedro? Pedro! Just leave him alone! Get the hell away from here! Get away! I won't let you touch him! Do you hear me? And I'll get out of here alive! I won't be your carrion! Do you understand, you bastards? Dogs! People! No... No... It's the jungle laughing at me out loud. Pedro warned me about it. He did... Hey! Hey! Who's there? Who's there? We thought you were dying, my friend. I can imagine. At least you tried your best. Where's the other fellow? What other fellow? Your boss or whatever he is. The one who cut the bridge when I was asking for help. You're still delirious with fever. It's only me and my mother here. Clear enough? I saw him last night. Tell him not to be a coward and come forward. I dare him to tell me why did he try to kill me. Watch your mouth, mister. I don't have any boss. I don't know of anyone who may have tried to do you in. You talk like a goon. - I warned you! - Don't beat him! Can't you see he can't defend himself? My father left him here for you to cure him, not to mistreat him. What do you want now? Let go of me! Let go of me! Keep it down, mister. - You'll be alright. - You! You tell me I'll be alright, you jerk? Shut up! You may regret if you don't. I'm not afraid of your bluster! Look. Don't make me lose my patience. I told you'll be alright. Do you understand? I tried to kill you, it's true. But I'll do it if you refuse to obey me or you try to play me. And you still dare to set conditions to me? No. They're orders. Against my will, you'll have to live in my house, under my own roof. Until you heal completely so you can go away. - Against your will? - Yes! And I won't let you stay here more than necessary! I'm the first one wanting to get the hell out of here! Unfortunately, we're 5 days away from the nearest village and you're not fit to walk. Take him away! What's all the consideration? It's my daughter. And let me warn you that she must be something very sacred for you. You'll understand why as soon as you know how she is. What are you waiting for? I'm going to check your leg. Take that off. Bernab√©... Bring me hot water and some rags. Here's your wallet. I'll give your gun back when you leave. - Check if anything's missing. - It won't be necessary. It looks like you have practice in this. In life you learn from everything. Your wife must be very worried. I saw you're married when I checked your wallet. I needed to make sure about who you are. Is there any way I could get in touch with her? It isn't easy but we can try. I'll send M√°ximo to Valle Escondido. An old hunter like him won't back down in the face of difficulties. The nearest post station is in Valle Escondido. In your letter, you can tell your wife or whoever... that they can find you in Papantla in around... 15 or 20 days. That's fine. Your leg is not as bad as we thought. You'll be able to walk in a few days with some caution. Put some warm compresses on his leg and patch it up. No need to splint it. Bernab√© will keep you company. Call me if you need anything. You mean I've been assigned a guard, as your prisoner. I've got my reasons. That's the way it is. So you wash now? These are the stranger's clothes. I'll iron it and will bring it to him. Juanito Victoriano will take care of that. Why? I can do it myself. I hate to say things twice. What's so bad about it, dad? Nothing, but I don't want you to speak with that man. Understood? You talk to me as if I was a stranger. I never heard you with such an ugly voice before. I told that man that he's not welcome at El Para√≠so. He'll have to leave sooner than I expected. Are you going to kick him out of here? My darling... The hardest times are already over. But even then or in moments of calm... your memory has always stayed with me. I'll soon be by your side. I expect to come back to Patancla in 15 or 20 days. You can go. You too. Y√°scara... What brings you here? I cleaned your clothes and now I'll bathe you because you are very dirty. What are you going to do? I told you. You need a bath. Why not? I don't need your help. I can do it myself. I'm not a kid. I don't understand. It's as if I'd try to bathe *you*. - Well, okay... - No, wait! Didn't you say...? It was nothing but an example... You can wash my hair if you want. You hair is so dirty and stiff as boar hair. Last time I took a bath it wasn't by choice. They forgot to hand me some soap. You'd better forget it. My father wouldn't let you get into El Para√≠so because he thought you were a bad man. But I know you're a good man. How do you know? - Maybe your father was right. - No. When I sense something, I never get it wrong. The heart doesn't lie. My father wants you to go away as soon as you're cured. - What about you? - I want you to stay. What is it? You're a very strange girl, Y√°scara. Do you always say and do what you feel? Yes, I do. You don't? No, you can't do that in the world where I live. I know. My father says that city people are bad and selfish. They hate and lie to each other, and are unable to be happy. But things are different here. We love and help each other out. Please stay with us, stranger. Why do you want me to stay? You barely know me. Because I'm going to love you a lot. I felt it ever since I took you out of the river. - You took me out of the river? - Yes. When I saw you lying on the rocks, I thought that the river didn't want you to leave El Para√≠so. It brought you for me. And that you'd never leave me. Y√°scara, your dad's back. He's looking for you. See you later, stranger. Federico! Y√°scara... Hold on a second. Please don't move. What's going on? Why are you afraid? You can never be too sure about you. You always catch people off guard. - Here's your razor. - Thank you very much. Okay, start shaving your beard. I can't wait to see you without it. Federico... Would you like to be my old man? - What? - My old man. My man. As M√°ximo is to Victoriana, and Bernab√© is to Juanita. As the friend of the girl. Yes, I would. But it's not possible. I'm a married man. I already have my... ...old woman. Forget about her. She's very far away. Whereas you and me are very close. - Does she look like me? - No. She's weak, delicate... and fragile like a wheat spike. Is she pretty? Do you like her better than me? You are... different. Then you like me better. She can't be. What do you mean? - She can't be your wife. - Why? You said she's weak. Haven't you seen the animals in the jungle? A wildcat won't love a doe. And a bear won't love a female coyote. You are strong, and I am strong. We're like wolf and she-wolf. You must be my old man. What is it? You look so handsome. - I don't want her to see you. - What are you going to do? Y√°scara! What did you do with the portrait? I left it in the water. Under a large stone. Why? So that you'll look at me. You are mine. As if you were... me myself. This is you and this is me. We have to be... always. Y√°scara... After three days, I'm resuming this letter and... I feel so confused... I trust that this anguish I'm feeling will disappear as soon as I'm by your side... I'm sorry to see you all working while I look like a lazy bum. I'd like to be of any help. We don't need your help. Your leg is important now. I'm happy to see you're recovering. Bernab√©! Tighten this rope from the other side. It's getting loose! So much work, and it's all my fault. Very nice from you to admit it. Wouldn't have been easier for you to shoot me down instead? In cases like yours, I prefer accidents. Why were you so eager to get rid of me? You didn't know me and I didn't hurt you at all. Life has taught me to trust no one. You didn't have to be an exception. I'm here by sheer chance, and you have no reason to attack me. I don't want to pose any danger for you or anybody! You're wrong, mister. My daughter is falling in love with you. That's the main reason why you'll have to leave soon. The bridge can be crossed again now. And if you're a good man... Then promise me that you won't tell Y√°scara that you're leaving. I promise. What's wrong with that rope? You see? When one's pollen is crossed with another, vanilla grows big and strong. As our children would. Flowers are like people. Some are male, some are female. And they produce offspring like dogs or deer do. As M√°ximo and Victoriana, who had Bernab√©. Look. Juanita is like the flower which will soon bear fruit. Why are you so quiet? I've been talking to you for a while and I haven't got an answer. What are you thinking of? I'm thinking of you. I'm thinking of you and the world I left behind. Which is waiting for me. Would you leave me to go back to her? I would feel miserable if I'd lose you. Do you love me that much? Yes, I do. If one day I didn't have you, it would be as if the sun stopped shining. As if all the flowers in the jungle had withered. As if all the birds would stop singing and die in their nests. Oh, Y√°scara... I don't deserve your love. I've suffered a lot sometimes. Whenever I've been sick, or when I've been bitten by venomous animals. Or when I got pricked by a thorn. But that's nothing compared with the pain of losing you. Federico! Look! Bernab√© set bird traps again. I told him not to do it! Birds are free like the air, like me! Calm down. It's not such a big deal. I get very angry when I see them locked up and unable to fly. Bernab√© can't see that he wouldn't like to be a prisoner either. And you? Why don't you fly away? Oh, his little wing is broken. I killed him. I killed him! Y√°scara... Y√°scara, don't... My father has taken longer to come back than in other full moon nights. He may have had his reasons for it. Why full moon nights exactly? It's when he goes out in the mountains alone. And there he stays with his thoughts alone. With all his own memories. The boss wouldn't like to hear us talking about these things. And much less with a stranger around. Federico is not a stranger. He's going to stay with us, so he'd better start learning our customs. I haven't heard the boss telling that he'd be staying. My father will say he must stay. What if he won't? What if he'd order me to leave? I only know that if he insists on you leaving, I'll go with you. And if you don't want to or nobody wants to... I'll cut my throat with a knife! Or I'll throw myself into the waterfall. What are you saying, Y√°scara? Why are you asking me if you already heard? I want you to tell *me*, your father. I'm the first one who must know about your plans. What you need to know, father... ...is that I love Federico. I love him more than I love you, and I love you so much. If you separate him from me... I'll kill myself. I swear I'll do it! The stranger will leave regardless because these are my orders. But if he really loves you, he'll come back. Let him go back to his world, see his wife again, live the atmosphere he's always lived in. If he discovers that all of that is a lie, rest assured that he will come back to you. And that will be true love indeed. And then we'll welcome him with open arms. If you hid from me that he was leaving, how will I know that you're not fooling me and that you'll try to stop Federico from coming back to me? If you'd meant what you say, you wouldn't make me leave. Your obstinacy only goes to show that you fine words are nothing but an excuse to keep me away from Y√°scara. You've only ever cared about your problems and never cared about those from others. That's why when your daughter responds innocently to the calls of her youth, of her nature... The only thing that occurs to you is to make her feel miserable. And I'm not saying that because I'm part of it. It would have been just the same with another. And even though you may force me to leave, just listen to this: I love Y√°scara. I love her with all my heart and soul. You're leaving tomorrow! M√°ximo will have your horses ready and will lead you to the nearest town. My decision is final. You go back to your room and stay there until I tell you otherwise. I hope you won't have to regret it, father. Bernab√©! What? Call the boss, quick! Y√°scara! Victoriana! Boss! Look! Look at the horses! Him! He did it, so that he couldn't leave! You filthy dog, you think you got away with it? - Who did this? - You did, why of course! He didn't do it! I did it, father. You? Did you really kill those two useful horses? Yes! And I'll do anything to make him stay! I won't put up with that! I slapped my daughter because of you! My own daughter! Don't hit him! Let go of me! Father don't hurt him! No father, no! No father, no! Let go of me! I need to stop him! Please father, stop! Let go of me! Let go of me! Let go of me! Let go of me! Let go of me! Let me go! Let go of me! Let go of me! Father, don't hurt him! Leave him alone! He didn't do anything! If you keep on hitting him I'll hate you forever! Please let me finish him! No! It's alright, M√°ximo. I slapped my daughter... Nobody has ever heard me say these words... Please forgive me, Y√°scara. Stop hurting yourself, father. I know how much you're suffering because of me. The time had to come in which your love had to be taken away from me. The rage I saw in your eyes when you were defending him... ...is something I'll never forget. You're right. You defend what you love. And you do it face to face. Against anyone. Even against me. I'd give you my life to make you happy. - I'm your worst enemy! - Don't say that, father! I've made you the way you are. I've had you in isolation because I love you. Out of self-interest. I should have taken you away from here many years ago. But I want you to know the storm I've been through. The words you heard the stranger say, I've already told myself countless times. Yes, I'm selfish. And I've been afraid to admit the truth up to the last minute. Just leave me, Y√°scara. I'm drunk for the first time in many years, and now I'm saying things that hurt me. You're the only thing I have in the world. Please don't hate me. Come on now... Please leave me alone. You don't even deserve this! - Why did you follow me? - Ignacio, please calm down. I thought something could happen to you in your condition. There must be something very serious in your life that may have led you to live in such a weird way. Yes, and the cause of all this is there. Irene. Y√°scara's mother. Her father objected to our marriage based on social prejudice. I took hold of some money which wasn't mine and we ran away. It all happened as if in a dream. The first sense of reality... was when I found myself in the jungle at night with Irene by my side. We had no choice other than to resign ourselves to living here. Away from malice and hatred. Y√°scara was born... I was happy with Irene. Until I found out she was cheating on me with a man to whom I saved his life before. A pilot from an oil company who crashed there. When I found out about it, Irene behaved her usual self. I couldn't take it anymore, and I killed her. What happened to the pilot? He didn't get very far. M√°ximo took care of him. I devoted myself entirely to Y√°scara ever since then. And then I became notorious in the region under El Juare√±o moniker by fighting against the abuses of the chieftainship system. Of which I had been a victim too. Look! They're heading to El Para√≠so. Tell the boss about it! Listen... We'd better hide in the shelter on the cliff. No, M√°ximo. I knew that one day I'd have to face my fate. - I'll turn myself in. - Order me anything, Mr. Ignacio! Order me to kill myself right now, but don't give up on us. I appreciate your loyalty, M√°ximo. Please take care of Y√°scara. I know she'll be just as safe in your hands as she is in mine. El Juare√±o is going away so that Ignacio Santos can come back. Free from his past and with his head up high. What's going on, father? What are those soldiers here for? I'll have to leave you for some time. But don't worry. This separation wants no goodbyes. It's something that... I'll come back soon. I expected to find you in worse shape. But I see you've been quite alright. Aren't you mistaking me for someone else? You are Federico Gast√≥n if I'm not mistaken. From the Ormex chemical products company. Is that right? Yes, sir. How do you know? Your wife gave us this photo of yours. - So how can I help you, lieutenant? - What? How can I help you, you say? I'm here to rescue you. Five patrols have been looking for you in the jungle for the last ten days. You were presumed dead. But when only your guide's dead body appeared down the river, hopes were rekindled and an intense search started. Ten days. I've lost track of time. When did you arrive here? I couldn't say. They looked after me here. I arrived unconscious. I don't know how. Your wife will be very happy to see you. She's in Papantla. Patricia... In Papantla... I barely had time to think of her. I've only had time to take care of myself. Not thinking of anyone else. Are you ready to leave right away? I don't know. I don't know. I need to pull myself together. I'm suffering from some kind of... ...self abandonment, ...indifference. As if I was a different person now. I'll appreciate if you can wait for a bit. Please. Y√°scara! Don't look at me with pity. Y√°scara, you need to understand. I'm suffering as much as you are. I love you with all my heart. Yours are words in the wind. I know what you're going to say. You're leaving. There's no other way out of this. The will of God is beyond our control. God has decided that I need to come back to fulfill my duty. And sacrifice my love for you. When they forced you to leave, I killed the horses. If someone would take you away, I'd find you no matter what. No river, ravine or man could stop me. I'd go alone. And my eyes would be able to even see in the dark to find you. I could tell your voice from all the sounds of the jungle. And as a tiger can smell the blood of a deer, I would follow your scent to find you. But nobody's taking you away, Federico. It's you who's leaving. You don't understand, Y√°scara. It's not only me. I belong to a society which controls my own freedom. I do understand. Your old woman is waiting for you. But she wouldn't come looking for you. She told others to do it. No... It's not only her who's forcing me to leave. There are many things that you wouldn't understand because you are free. And you don't know how heavy some words can be. Like "duty", "matrimony", "religion"... Your notions of life are different, and they won't let you see mine. Y√°scara... I love you like I never loved anyone before. I suffer as much or more than you, believe me. But I must go. No, please don't leave me. Ever since that day... right here... your kisses thrilled me... ...very deep inside. But if you'd kiss me now, I guess the thrill wouldn't get past my lips. Federico don't go! Please stay and I'll do whatever you like. If you like your old woman, then tell me what is she like, and I'll be like her. Tell those men that I saved your life. That you're mine! Your old woman can have another man. And I only have you. Don't torment me and stop tormenting yourself. I adore you, Y√°scara, but I must go. Goodbye, Ignacio. Goodbye... ...stranger. Let's go, lieutenant. Y√°scara... Let him go. But if he really loves you, he'll come back. Let him get back to his world. Let him live the atmosphere he's always lived in again. If he discovers that all of that is a lie, rest assured that he will come back to you. And that will be true love indeed. THE END ****Fansubs by MoonCT*** ** updated for the uncut version **
