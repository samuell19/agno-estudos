Four. What's the plan? I'm out, guys. BEFORE GOING ON STAGE PISS AND BLOW YOUR NOSE! I'll go. Well… As you may have noticed, the crowd is quite small. So we're sorry, but we can't play. I think it's best if you come back on Saturday, maybe. I'm not surprised. We haven't put up posters in eight days. -Friday? -Yes? Don't go. We'll put up posters. -You aren't wearing gloves. -I couldn't find them. -Listen… -I'm listening. Yes? Yes, yes… -You're not eating? -I'm not hungry. What about Sarah? What about her? I don't know. Have you heard from her? No. Is that so? Don't start. Fine. Good night. -Yes? -Four plus three: seven. With the two who phoned and the last-minute guy, that makes ten. The posters worked. Yeah. Close the door, damn it! Why didn't you go through the room? There's a crowd at the register. I heard it was crowded? Five. Broke. I sold them tickets for five francs. You're selling them cheap. Where's Josepha? She's on her way. Five minutes. Are you ready? No, Josepha isn't here yet. What? -No, nothing! -One minute until it starts. Hi guys. I'll start with my favorite. Isn't it gorgeous? Yes, I know! You'll say: "You don't have shoes that go with it." Wait! Look! -What do you think? -Beautiful. You have two minutes. We're on! We're playing? Yes, and you'd better hurry. I believe this is where it all started, when the car drove away… at the end of one October day, very long ago. We could have gone back further, to the very start of this tragedy. We preferred this precise moment when Jacob opened the door, stepped forward and said… I stepped in shit on the way here. I know she won't come back. We'll never see her again. And yet, I wait for her. Oh well. One day, I'll hear a car… stopping in front of the house. Footsteps on the gravel. The door opening. It's her. She came back! -I'm glad she chose you. -You're the one she loved. That's true. Josepha, what are you doing? I'm here. I went through the back door. "I came…" What? What did you say? "I came to talk to you…" Oh, yeah. Here, the author wrote a whole spread on love. And the least we can say is he knows nothing about it. We can skip it. Ladies and gentlemen, what I just did is wrong. A play is sacred. "The show must go on…" And all that. It's sacred. In fact, it's the only thing that is. No one cares about the rest. Right, Sarah? You didn't invite her? What a shame. Okay. Friday, give them a refund, please. Why? Isn't what I'm saying interesting? Isn't the lovely Sarah's story worth 35 francs? Hey, you there! Wait! Aren't you interested? What do you want? Tell me! We'll try to give it to you. Sex? You'd like that, huh? Do you want to see my breasts? Is that what you want? Want to get a little hard? There you go! Is this what you want? Damn it! Answer me! Stop. Go home. Want me to come down, damn it? Get out! It's over. We can't fix this. -No, that's not true! -Yes it is! It is! You always say that. It happens again each time. The show is over. You have 48 hours to dismantle and evacuate the set. Don't forget to lock up. I'll go get changed. Moulu? Are you mad at me? You don't see performances like that very often. That's true. "Ladies and Gentlemen, here the author wrote a whole spread…" Sylvain won't be pleased! The little old man's face when you showed your tits. Is this what you want? We should have raised the ticket prices! Who's a good boy? You're a good boy! Excuse me. That was long. Excuse me. Steaks, beans, and hash browns. I'm starving! Hello? It's Claude. Josepha has an appointment at 11 at Ulysse Production for Jenner's film. Be on time and let me know. Good night, kids. And you thought they forgot about you. Jenner, huh… It's work. What else do you want? You. -What? -I want you. Oh! -Before or after diner? -Right now! The first one undressed chooses the position. You cheated. You weren't wearing a bra. Neither were you. You gained weight again. Not at all. It's just the lighting. I'm slim. Kiss me everywhere. That's enough Iago! We're a married couple. So be quiet. I stopped the pill. Stay. Listen. Jo? No! We can't do it like this. We need a plan. CASTING CLOSED And the other jerk says, "He went to the conservatory?" Can you believe it? Well, that's not all. Didn't you see on the door? The castings are closed. Josepha Manet. Just go in. Do we know each other? No, why? Then don't speak to me like that. Come on in. I'm glad to see you. I've wanted to work with you for a long time. You should have called sooner. Yes, well I have a small role for you. How small? It's good, I assure you. -What's the character's name? -Uh… That chick. -Oh? -Yeah. Well, no one really knows her name so they just call her "that chick". It's funny. When do I have to give an answer? As soon as possible. I'll go next door to read the script. Is an hour fine? Sounds good. So? It's nice and unpretentious, isn't it? Yes, it's not pretentious at all. -Where is it being filmed? -In Vittel. You'll be two weeks in a four-star hotel. It'll be great. What do you think of the role? I undress a lot. It depends on how you'll… Look, Bolleton is filming, so… So? I'll accept on one condition: that no one asks me why. Well, you know, we all need to pay our bills. CLAUDE HERMANN ARTIST'S REPRESENTATIVE 3 FLOOR Don't pretend you're working. I just called you. -Hello. -Hello. -You don't visit anymore. -You didn't invite me. Come and eat tonight. You need a written invitation? No, it's okay. -Who is this? -It's Josepha. It's about time. Come on in. I just got off the phone. You'll get 2 000 francs a day. -Are you happy? -Yes. I don't know. Yeah, I'm fine with it. Two weeks away from Paris will do me good. I'm sure it will. While you're there, try to get used to it. Used to what? Living without him. All right. I leave on May 2nd. -How long? -Two weeks. -Is it a good role? -Yes, of course. All I do is undress, scream in the showers, run down the hallways and do funny gags. And you accepted? It's two thousand francs a day. Shall we go? Where is it? Vittel. It's not too far. I could come see you. So, do we eat at home? Yes. I invited Dolly. We'd best make something hearty! There. Help yourself. No, thank you. Oh, okay. Here. -Thanks. -I like your dress. Really? I got it on sale. Ninety-eight francs. That's cheap. So… How's Jacques? Jacques? Oh, him. He left. -Do you have any mustard? -Here. -There you go! -Thank you. I'm with Gilbert now. He's an idiot, but he has a big one. Your recipe's nice, but I use more potatoes. I didn't tell you. My husband called me. He wants to marry again with an Englishwoman. Really? That guy's an idiot. No, really. A two day voice-over job at Kessler, should do it or not? Sure, why not? It'll keep you busy. Yeah. I love you. Me too. Say, if we didn't live together, would you be sad? Yes, very sad. Iago. You can call Sarah, tell her the coast is clear. Second floor, room 204. We haven't been told you had a dog. I'll pay for him. -Is that okay? -Yes. Iago, get off the bed! Here you are, miss. Thank you, miss. Now you can go. What should we do? Should we call him or wait for him to call? Let's call him. Hello. You've reached Michel Laurent and Josepha Manet. We're not home right now. Please leave a message after the tone. Why aren't you home? I wanted to tell you… Nothing, forget it. Are the scripts ready for tomorrow? Josepha Manet. Did you get there all right? You start at 2 pm. -Do you have a car? -Yes. It's 20 km from here. It will take you half an hour. Here, take a map. Thank you. Move over. The room was only vacated ten minutes ago. Excuse me. My car broke down. Can you call me a cab? He left for the station. He'll be gone for half an hour. I have to be at work in 25 minutes. What should I do? Take my car. Yes? Really? You don't mind? I can't bring it back until tonight. I'm not going anywhere. It's in the parking lot. The red one next to the green Jaguar. Thank you. -I'm off then. -Yeah, see you later. -I can't. -Why not? I thought you had a normal car. Normal? It's a fine vehicle. I can't drive something like that. -That was fast! -Are you an actress? Sort of, yes. Want me to pick you up? No. A staff member will take me back. It was nice of you to bring me. Thank you. Nice entrance! Makeup is this way. -Who is that guy? -You didn't recognize him? -No. -It was Fassbinder. -Oh! -Yes. He came to see me. -Aren't you cold? -I'm freezing! Shall we have coffee? If I refuse, you'll think me ungrateful. I was counting on that. Régis, we thought you weren't coming this year. You can't upset your doctor when he's your friend. Let me introduce you. This young lady whose name I don't know is an actress. Mr. and Mrs. Stavenne. -Good evening. -Nice to meet you. Do you think we could come watch the shoot? It's quite boring, you know. Are you kidding? Compared to a spa? You don't know how to keep busy. I'm never bored. Sure. Did you bring Judith? -Of course. -Give her a kiss for us. I will. Is it really boring? What? On set? Yes, it is. Hey, beautiful, you're wanted on the phone. Thank you. -I'll be right back. -I'll be waiting. Hello. You speak French very well. I beg your pardon? I just wanted to tell you that Maria Braun's Wedding is… a masterpiece. Oh yeah? Well, I'll leave you to it. Bye-bye. I don't know. It wouldn't start. Just as I was leaving. Someone gave me a ride. He has a Range Rover. What are you doing now? I was going to have coffee with him. What is he like? He's not bad. What is he doing there? Apparently, he's on a cure. When are you coming? Saturday. Okay. I love you. Leaving already? In a hurry to get back to your guy? You see right through me. Bye. -Another coffee? -No. I need to walk my dog. Would you like some help? -Help? -To walk your dog. Is Judith sick? I hope not. Only she prefers a different establishment. If you have the time, I'd be happy to introduce you. Sure. -Good night. -Good night. Do I fill it up? Wait… We can't see anything. No, we can't see. Hey, can't you open the raincoat a bit? -We can't see… -You want to see my breasts? No, I just want to see… Like this? Wait a second… Yeah, it needs to be a bit more… a bit more… Like this? Yes, perfect. In place everyone. -Start the roll. -Announcement. Like flies,122 first. Go, Michou. Do I fill it up? Cut! It's funny, right? Yes, very funny. Yeah, it's funny… Great. We won't do it again. I know. At least not today. Why are you here? -I came to pick you up. -Why? Didn't you see my letter? No. -That's a shame. -What did it say? It was an invitation to meet Judith. Shall we? Judith. Josepha. What a surprise. I didn't ride her this morning. I'll let her out for a bit. At times like this, I always wonder why we sit on their backs. What exactly do you do, besides horseback riding? I breed them. I'm a breeder. Oh, okay. There's a great restaurant here, I reserved a table. Oh. No, I'm sorry. I think we'd better go back. I call my husband every night. When he doesn't call me, I call him. He's coming on Saturday. I'll introduce you. We could go to your restaurant together. Where is she? Huh? Where is she? Hi. What a shitty train. We went to Culmont, Contrexéville and half of the local villages. I'm glad to see you. Shall we go? They gave you a great room! Of course, they did. I can leave if you want. Do as you please. At least pretend to care. What's this? What? "We mustn't let the misunderstandings last too long. "I'll pick you up at the shoot. Régis." Is this the Range Rover guy? Yes. He's not messing around! No, he's not. If we go down after 8 pm, they get all pouty. Say something. Well… What do you want me to say? Since I got here, you haven't said a word. I promised myself something before you came. It was to avoid talking about Sarah. Unfortunately, all I want to do is talk about her. So I'm keeping quiet. Do you think there's a night train to Paris? We can always ask. Thank you. Keep it, you'll need it on the train. Oh. I meant to tell you… Tuesday, on TV, they're airingL'Arme Blanche. The drama I did with Letellier. I'd love to hear what you think. Okay. I'll watch it. Good. Why did you do that? Huh? Why did you do that? Why? PLATFORM 1 Is Mr. Duchemin there, please? No. He's out. Do you want to leave a message? Yes. Tell him that Josepha is waiting at the bar. You wanted to see me? Yes. You're awfully chic. Thank you. Why don't we go to your restaurant? -With your husband? -Without him. My husband left. He left as soon as he arrived. I already ate. So did I. We divorced five years ago. -Any other questions? -Yes. Plenty. And you? Are you a good actress? Yeah, I'm fine. That's all? I don't want to talk about myself. -Would you like another coffee? -No. -Shall we go back? -Yes. Where shall we meet? We don't have to. It's up to you. Tomorrow. Maybe tomorrow I won't feel like it. All the more reason. What are you thinking about? Your husband. How long have you been together? I don't know. Ten years, maybe more. Is he a great actor, or just… good? No. He's a great actor. He could be a star, but he's afraid. What do you mean? He performs just to perform. It never comes from his heart. How did you guys meet? On a set. We were extras in an American movie. One day, he took me to his place, he made me a cheese omelet, and we made love. That's it. Enough talk. Yes? How are you? Jo? Did you see the time? I couldn't sleep. Could you? I was sleeping quite well. Are you calling for a reason or just to say hello? I wanted to tell you that I regret what happened last night. Really? And also that… Are you alone? Of course, I'm alone. You don't believe me? Prove it. How? By repeating after me in a loud voice, "You're my wife, I love you." You're my wife, I love you. Sleep well, Michel. No comments! Lame. Lame and boring. The shepherd's pie is good. And I asked Josepha to watch it… I'll call her. It was L'Arme Blanche, a drama by Serge Letellier, with Michel Laurent and Odette André. This drama was specially adapted for television by José Rangose from his novel Le Haut Mal. Serge Colin will present… For now, Emmanuel Monche… -No answer. -Maybe she didn't watch. Maybe she's working tonight. Yes, maybe. Did it get better at the end? No, not really. He just called me. What did he say? Nothing. I didn't answer. He cheated on me for a year with a press agent. I'm going back home in three days. Can I have your… No. No phone calls, no letter. Nothing. I'll give you my agent's number. Ask for Dolly. Leave a message. Your address, your number. Do you know what this means? -We're going to meet secretly. -Yes, I don't mind. Give me a cigarette. Iago? Iago? Come, we're leaving. I want you to say it. It was always just you. No one else. Cut! Lily! Oh, you're here. When did you arrive? Just now. Who got you this job? Claude? It's Luc. At first, I had lines. Now I just fuck that girl. Hey! -How are you? -I'm fine. Let's grab some food, I'm hungry. You're smoking Americans now? Yeah. Let's put on a play again. I heard about an unpublished work by Pinter. One flop a year is all I can take. Okay. Then how about a kid? No. I'll see you at home. Jo? You might as well know right now, it'll be okay! What great news! He just arrived. He's at the Royal Monceau. Call him. Who? You're on your own. Say it's Zinnemann, he's in Paris. Fred Zinnemann, boy, that's great! Don't get excited. He didn't hear me speak English. Tell him that tomorrow morning, you'll take classes at Berlitz! Tell him! -I'll tell him. -Okay! -See you. -See you. Wait, let me look at you. If he doesn't hire you, he's really gay. I agree. Tell him about Berlitz! Do you recognize me? We started in a hotel, we'll continue in one. How's Judith? Recovering from the trip. You put her in a truck, right? It's called a van. I knew a horse who broke a van on every trip. He escaped twice on the western highway. Some horses travel well, others, not so much. It's like love. It's for a fast-paced English course. I would like… No, not for me. It doesn't matter. Yes? How do we look, the two of us, naked in a hotel room at three in the afternoon? Can you tell me? We look good. Come to my place. We'll have lots of time. -Every night we could… -Be quiet. No. Get up when I'm gone. Leave him. No. So? You could have warmed them up. No, Zinnemann! I didn't see him. I saw a guy called Régis Duchemin. Who's he? He lives near Rambouillet, he raises horses. What? We were at a hotel. We slept together. Wait, I don't understand. I also forgot to tell you that he has a Range Rover. What's his name? Régis. It happened over there? Before I came? After. But I knew it would happen. That's it. Is that why you were so unpleasant? Yes. I was mad at you. What for? For making me do this. What you're saying is completely stupid. So? Ask me questions. I'll answer. How did it happen? After you left the station, I went back to the hotel, went to the bar, called him. He came. -And he banged you. -Yes. -What about Iago? -Iago? Did he see? What difference does it make? Did he see or not? -What's wrong with you? -Did he see or not? -He did, so what? -So what? So you joined him in his room and you screwed. -Is that it? -Yes. How? Fuck you! And it started again the next day? He took me to see his horses. -Why? -To make me happy. You didn't care about horses. You just wanted to get banged. After that? We watched your movie on TV. Together? At first. -What do you mean at first? -He left. He left? -Left to go where? -To his room. Why? I think he found it boring. Did he say it was boring? No, but it was… It was amazing. You went into his room and you fucked him again? Not right away. We talked first. Well, I did. "Talked"? About what? You and Sarah. Will you keep your coat on all day? Are you done? Well. What happened to us is quite common. Let's not dramatize it. Don't you agree? No. Very well, go on. He phoned me. -Here? -He called Dolly. Oh! Does Dolly know? Yes. She was the messenger? Yes. Okay. Shall we make coffee? You don't want anything? Well, I do. I'd rather finish first. -Finish what? -Us. We're not the first ones to go through this. Now I'd like some coffee. -Yes? -Hey, you're already home? Yes. Did it go well? Oh, I see. I have an appointment for Michel. 2:30, Monceau Theater, with Marchand, for Romelli's latest play. Okay, I'll tell him. Can I stay at your place for a few days? Really? Oh, okay. I see. I'm not around much anyway. -When? -Is tomorrow morning okay? Yeah, sounds good. Tell him about Marchand. Yes, I will. See you tomorrow. Tell me what? Marchand wants you at the Monceau Theater tomorrow. When are you leaving? Tomorrow morning. What do we do until then? We don't ask any more questions. What about Iago? Do we cut him in half? It's customary that children be with their mother. Not anymore. It's the children who decide. Fine. Tomorrow morning, we'll go to the woods with Iago. We'll split up. He'll follow whoever he wants. I think I'll leave the business. Really? Yes. I don't enjoy it that much anymore, and… it's now or never. Michel. If ever the role you're waiting for comes one day give it your all, please. What does that mean? It means that you have things in you that you've never used before. It would be nice if they were used. Goodbye. I'm going to the car. You go the other way. Iago will choose. Whenever you're ready. Goodbye. -How are you? -I'm good. We're putting together a Romelli. So, nothing special to say. You gotta pay your taxes. There's a role for you. -A good role? -No, a really bad one. But we need a talented guy to make it work. "The babysitter doesn't want to sleep alone." Yes, we're not unhappy with the title. No. She doesn't like the script, Serge. I can't help it. Yes. One second. Yes. That's right. Try it again. Very well. Goodbye. You saw Marchand? Yes. I'll do it if the pay is good. It is. Other than that? Nothing special. Can I have your number? Josepha forgot. Why don't you just leave her alone? Is that what she said? No. I'm giving you some advice. Oh. -For the advice. -Are you crazy? That's for the calls. That's for being the messenger. Are you crazy? What's wrong with you? Shut up! Leave me alone! -You too! -You bastard! You're sick! -Shit! -Stop it! You can start looking for a new agent. Are you mad at me? No. Good. You could wait until I'm finished to do that. Yeah. Do you mind if Gilbert comes over tonight? His in-laws are at his place. I don't mind. You're not sleeping? -I'm waiting for him to leave. -He's sleeping over. Look. I don't see anything. Look! He cut me up like inClockwork Orange! How amusing. -Don't be like that. -Like what? -Come. -Where? Stop shoving your tits under my nose. Come, that's all he's asking for. You can't be serious! Iago! Where are you going? Yes? Hello? This is Josepha Manet. I would need a room, a bed, dry pajamas, and an itinerary to get there. Over. Where are you? Avenue Marceau. In a leaky phone booth. The machine is eating up my last coin. If I give you directions, you'll get lost. Time's up! What's the plan? Take the southern highway, Chartres ramp, and exit at Les Ulis. -What then? Hurry! -I'll meet you there. We would have been better off screwing the incomparable Gilbert. Where is he, dammit? Here he is. See, you're always freaking out. -The dogs won't attack him? -No, don't worry. Dogs, meet Iago. See? They're less complicated than us. If we don't sniff each other's butts, we can at least shake hands. Come on! Have a seat. Would you like a drink? So? I'm listening. I had an argument with Michel. An argument? That's all? That's all. Very well. You could have gone to a hotel. Yes, I could have. It's ready. My daughter Babette. Josepha. Good evening. Good evening. I only found two covers, is that okay? Yes, of course. I'm sorry to come to you like this. Well, I'm going back to bed. Good night. Is that Iago? Yes. You're handsome, Iago. -Good night. -Good night. Did you tell her about me? I tell her everything and she tells me nothing. It's the key to our relationship. We hooked up the heater. It should be warm enough. How long did it take you to stop thinking of your wife? I don't know. Because you still think of her? Do you hate her? We eat breakfast at 9:00. Good night. -Sleep well? -Sort of. Where's Babette? At school. She likes you. Oh. She's not too angry, then? Apparently not. She asked how long you were staying. I'm not sure yet. What do you mean? I didn't have an argument with Michel. I left him. For good? Yes. Toast? You want me to make the first move? Will you teach me to ride a horse? Oh! That'll take a long time. I have plenty of time. Hello? Yes? Please hold. It's for you. Yes? Who's the guy who answered the phone? A friend. Do I know him? Well, answer. I'm in the middle of a chess game. What did you want? Nothing. Oh, yes. I love you. That's too bad. Muller? That's not possible. He was with me. In your bed? Under her bed. You know what I mean? Not at all. If you didn't want to marry him, why did you do all that? I told you, I don't like sleeping alone. So? Don't forget that I had read the script. Well… Well, it wasn't that great. Did you read this one? Yes, I did. I even know who wrote it. -Really? -Yes. It's you. Yeah. It's not bad. But we would have to find a theater. I spoke with Friday. He's not mad anymore? Yeah! Oh. Okay. Tell me, Laurent, what exactly was that bullshit in Act III? It was boring. I had to do something. Do me a favor, save your little improvisations for the three spectators you usually work for, okay? Is that clear? Tomorrow, I'll fix acts I and II too. Well, in that case, you're fired! That's the best news I've heard all day. You have a knack for getting people to like you in the business. I know. They have a show at the Quatorze? Well, that's just it. The Lorca has just been canceled. Friday's looking for something. Listen up. Three characters, no set, it should be fine. There's still a problem. Yes. The female role. -I wrote it for… -Josepha. Yeah. I'll try. I can't promise anything. No! Let him go and then whip him, don't force him. Let him decide. Go ahead. Come on, try again. I'm off. Hey boy! -How are you? -Iago! What are you doing here? I was passing by, so I thought, "Since I'm here, I'll say a quick hello to Josepha." You gained weight. Yeah, a bit. What do you want? I wanted to see what he looks like! I can't do that? Well, look! Another Range Rover, huh. It's the same one. If I understood correctly, I'll see horses, right? Yes. Come. Wait… What? You want to see Régis? -Yes, but… -But what? Come. Well, huh… -What are you doing here? -I'm forgetting you. Are you teaching him to run out? I'm doing my best! Régis, we have company. Michel. Régis. What a surprise! Follow his lead, leave him be. Lift him up, he's too low! Pet him, and get off. Tell me, are you acting right now? Yes. In a play. Is it interesting? No. -I'm doing it for the money. -Oh! Do actors often perform plays that don't interest them, just for the money? I'm a professional actor. Which means that I work to earn money. I do my best with what I'm given. That's all. -I didn't mean to offend you. -I'm not offended at all. I hear you play chess. Sometimes. Shall we play? Listen… Excellent idea. So, who's winning? Check. Indeed. Check. Yes. Checkmate. Well, congratulations. It's been a while since I've had such a good game. I don't deserve any credit. Why? You did a great job… I used to be a professional chess player. It was my bread and butter. What do you mean? I was at the conservatory. Broke and… On Sunday nights, in cafés, that's all I did. In that case, how much do I owe you? Is dinner okay? Come on, stay over for dinner. We need to put Gabelou in. Don't worry. I'm leaving. You have to read this. It's a great play. We're doing it with Moulu at the Quatorze. Oh. So? No. -If anyone else were to offer-- -It's different. A play at the Quatorze, with you and Moulu, it's a family affair. I'm no longer family. Very well. You want to work with me on a professional basis? Great! So, I'll offer you a contract at minimum wage, I'll pay for your rehearsal time. All we ask is that you arrive a half-hour early, perform the play, then you can go back to your cowboy. -Deal? -No. Tell me what I have to do for you to do this play! Nothing. Jo… Moulu wrote this play. He wrote it for us. What are you trying to tell me? That we should get back together to please Moulu? Dammit! Come on, I'll show you out. You drove 50 kilometers on that? Yes. I shouldn't have come, huh? Wise guy. If you go there, you're in a better position to follow up. Well, if I have enough time, I will. -Here! -After, you just have to… -What's wrong? -Someone's there. There's no one. I thought someone came in. Okay. Let's go. -Cecile, go ahead. -So here it is… "Since his wife left him, he's had trouble breathing." "I think she must have taken the oxygen with her." You're not going to start again, are you? Okay, okay. I'm sorry. Uh… "Anything is possible." Would you like to go see Moulu's play? -Hi. -Hi. -Here. -Thanks, that's kind of you. Say, must I really put red on my nipples? Yes, why? I don't care, but Moulu does. -He thinks it's strange. -Eleven. Here you go. Five more minutes, and the room will be full. It's quite empty. People will come. We must be early. So, what do they look like? Nothing special. Josepha came. Really? Now I'm nervous. She'll think I'm bad. Is she alone? No. There's a guy and a girl with her. Ladies and gentlemen, on my right, the lustful nurse Salomé Rivedoux. I said "lustful". On my left, Doctor X, bent over the corpse of his marriage. He'll have to use a scalpel to cut into the fabric of his married life to discover the cause of death. Good. Let's start at the beginning. Well… Since his wife left him, he's had trouble breathing. She might have taken the oxygen with her. It could be. At first, I was doing very well. I don't get it. Where are you going? I'm taking these ladies to the autopsy room. Don't leave me alone. We won't be long. As for your oxygen problems, the next time you have trouble breathing, make sure you aren't underwater. Come on! This is your last chance! There you have it. All that's left is to give you a conclusion now. And you know as well as I do that there's only one end to everything. Ladies and gentlemen, in 100 years, we'll all be in the same place. Will those who have taken their loves with them be richer for it? That's it, you just got the author's message right in your face. Good night! It wasn't bad. Michel was amazing. If Friday keeps playing the music late, I'll kill him! Hey. Look at that! You've always had a knack for showing up when I'm naked. Your play is great, Moulu. It's funny, sad and poetic, like you. You're amazing. Much better than if I had played. I'm not sure. Did your friends leave? No. Come and say hello when you're ready. You look terrible. Yeah, yeah. I got old. Huh! Do you eat? Yes, from time to time. Do you get laid? Oh! Sometimes. With… Huh… Oh, no. Want to put up posters? I can't. Let's keep in touch? Yes, we'll keep in touch. Yes? Did they deliver the posters? You're never there! This is Therese from the T.P.P. Thévenon must have something for you, he wants to see you. See you at 6:00 pm at the theater. Okay? If you can't, call me back to make another appointment. Goodbye, ghost. Hello? Hello? No one. What's wrong with you? You look terrible. It's nothing. I'm fine. You know we're putting onMacbeth? -Rehearsal starts on Monday. -Still at minimum wage? Yes. -So it's a no. -No to what? When I want to starve, I do it at the Quatorze with my friends. But I've played in Macbeth many times. I've played Malcolm twice, Banco once, and even Duncan on tour. So, thank you, but I don't feel like it. Unless, of course, you give me Macbeth. In which case… Yes, I understand. Fine then. You can play Macbeth. Don't mess with me. Everyone knows you already hired Jouffroy. -That's right. -Yeah. But Jouffroy got into an accident on the northern highway. Two months in the hospital. Shit. I'm sending you a contract tonight. Get on the script right away. We only have six weeks, and that's not much. Hello, yes? Yes, I accept. Yes? All right. The guy who was supposed to play him had an accident. I read it inVSD. Jouffroy? Really? They say that Michel Laurent is replacing him. Hush, you! Didn't you know? It's good news, isn't it? He's playing Macbeth? Hello? -Hello? -It's me. I just heard the news. I'm glad. How are rehearsals going? Not too good. Why? Endless technical issues. In the end, we did nothing for ten days. Thévenon decided to do an English-style production, and everyone is lost. And you? I don't know. Three, four times, I thought I had it. And then, nothing. It's normal. Normal… We're eight days away. Eight days from what? The dress rehearsal! You'll be fine. I don't know. We'll see. What can I say? In any case, I'm doing my best. Josepha! -Stop yelling. -I'm not. I'm stating facts. Okay. Bye, Michel. Josepha! Is Thévenon there? He's on the set. It's jammed again. Tell him we won't have the wigs till 6 pm. All right. -Hey! -Hey. How are you? I'm fine, except that I keep peeing. If we miss the seamstress, it's a sign of good luck. Easy. I'm going. Slowly, at a trot. Okay. I'm sure he'll be great. I don't know why, I feel it. It'll be great. I'll tell you all about it. We start in 30 minutes. No noise on the set. We're opening the room. The witches, Duncan, Malcolm, Donalbain, and Lennox, on set, please. Macbeth and Banquo, on stage, please. The meeting? On the plain, once the battle is lost and won. To meet Macbeth. A drum, a drum, Macbeth is back. Worst and best day I have ever experienced. Greetings to you, Macbeth. Greetings to you, Macbeth. Greetings to you, who will soon be king. Didn't you hear a noise? Yes, but it was you who spoke. -When? -Just now! No! A sad sight. A voice, a voice said, "Don't sleep anymore." "Macbeth has killed sleep." Tomorrow, and tomorrow and tomorrow, creeps in this petty pace from day to day, to the last syllable of recorded time. I'm getting tired of the sun. Let the bell ring! Turn around, tyrant, and show your face. You're wasting your time. I will die by the hand of one who isn't born of a woman. You were there? Do they need the set tonight? -Why do you ask? -To work. Listen, Jo… It's too late. Tomorrow is the first night. Nothing more can be done. Tomorrow at 8:30 pm, it will be too late. I get it, Jo. It was bad. No. It was actually very good. Finish changing. I'll arrange for the set. You'll have to excuse me. I'm going to bed. I'm exhausted. I can't do this. What do you have to lose? Huh? What do you have to lose? You've lost your wife and your dog, you're 40 years old, in ten years you'll be playing cab drivers in TV dramas. What do you have to lose? Nothing. -It was Thévenon who wanted… -No. Thévenon looked for 15 other actors before taking you. You helped him save his season. How do you know that he considered 15 guys before choosing me? Claude told me. Thévenon never thought you could do better than tonight. Well, I did. -You know I tried. -No! You refused to take risks. That's what pisses me off. Because I know you can do it. You know that as well as I do. Verneuil Street. What? The last time we said that, we still lived on Verneuil Street. At the time, I said nothing. I listened to you. So, are we doing this or not? -"The table's full." -No. -"But the table's full." -No. -"The table's full." -That's it! "Here is a place for you, sir." -But… -Wait a minute. "Here, Lord here is a place for you." Fuck! Okay. Something is bothering me in this scene, I don't know what. -I would like to, I don't know, find a… -Jump. Can you imagine the look on Thévenon's face? I bet you that on opening night, I'll break a leg. "Here, Lord, here is a place for you, sir." "Here I am! Come on, talk! "There was a time when, when a man's head burst," "the man died," and it was over for him." "But here they come again and take our seats at the table!" Yes! Jo? Josepha? Yes? Let's go to the next one, it won't come back. No, it will come back. -I'm telling you that-- -It will come! I'm exhausted. I don't care. Listen… -"Tomorrow, and then tomorrow…" -No! -Yes, but… -No. You're going to die. It's the end. "Tomorrow, "and tomorrow," "and tomorrow," "creeps in this petty pace" "from day to day," to the last syllable of recorded time…" "And all our yesterdays have lighted fools the way to dusty death." "Life "is but a walking shadow," "a poor player," "that struts and frets" then is heard no more." "It's… "It's a tale" "told" "by an idiot," "full of sound and fury," "signifying" nothing." THE PLAY WAS A SUCCESS. JOSEPHA RETURNED TO LIVE WITH RÉGIS FOR A WHILE AND LEFT THE PROFESSION FOR GOOD. ONE EVENING, LONG AFTER. SHE CALLED MICHEL TO TELL HIM THAT IAGO DIED OF OLD AGE, AND WITHOUT SUFFERING. Subtitle translation by: Alexandra Dormoy
