[Mom:] Jim, you need to call the plumber. [Dad:] I can fix it! Just because you have me in a monkey suit all day doesn't mean that I don't know how to use my hands. [Door: SLAMS] [Danny:] They are getting worse. [Miles:] It will get better. [Danny:] Suzy Jacobs parents fought a lot. Then her dad left. [Miles:] Danny, mom and dad will make up. They always do. And, besides if they don't we move to Canada. [Danny:] Canada? What would we do in Canada? [Miles:] What everybody does in Canada. Go to Niagara Falls every day and eat gravy with our French fries. [Danny:] Gravy? Canadian's eat gravy with their French fries? Why? [Miles:] Because they're part French, makes them a little weird. [Birds: TWITTERING] [TV News anchor:] Suspense and suspicion have been developing throughout Florida this week. MacDill Air Force Base in Tampa and Patrick Air Force Base in Cape Canaveral have been put on alert. Yesterday the Jacksonville Naval station began staging readiness drills. Many suspect that these new developments may have something to do with Cuba. Washington still has denied this claim. However, many believe new hope will be the topic of tonight's Presidential address. We bring you to the White House for a special message from President Kennedy. [Dad: turning up TV volume] [TV Presidents voice:] Good evening my fellow citizens. This Government as promised has maintained the closest surveillance of the Soviet Military build up on the island of Cuba. Within the past week, unmistakable evidence has established the fact that a series of offensive missile sites is now in preparation on that imprisoned island. The purpose of these bases can be none other than to provide a nuclear strike capability. [Mom: turns TV OFF] [Dad:] You wanna let him finish? [Mom:] I think that is enough, for tonight. We'll read it in the paper tomorrow. [Music] [Danny:] The Commies have missiles pointed at us? [Miles:] Yes. [Danny:] But, where are they? [Miles:] They're in Cuba. [Danny:] That's right next to our house. [Miles:] It's next to Florida. Our house is in Davie. [Danny:] Are they mushroom missiles? [Miles:] Mushroom missiles? [Danny:] You know, the kind we dropped on Japan. They look like a big mushroom. [Miles:] I don't think they make those anymore. [Danny:] Are these missiles new? Are they better? I don't want them to hit us. [Miles: EMPHATICALLY] They're not going to hit us. [Danny:] They won't? [Miles:] No. Because we're going to stop them. Don't worry about how yet, I got a plan. Just get some sleep, we got a lot of work to do tomorrow. [Music] [Miles:] As you can see we're here and the missiles are there. What we need to do is go from point A, to point B. [Danny:] But, how? [Birds: TWITTERING] [Miles:] We'll build our own rockets, and we'll fly them over to Cuba. Our rockets will hit their missiles causing them to blow up. [Danny:] But, if the missiles blow up wouldn't that hurt the people in Cuba? [Miles:] No, because these will only make a blast big enough to make the Cuban missiles stop working. [Birds: TWITTERING] [Telephone: RINGING] [Telephone: RINGING] [Mom:] Hello? Oh, hi mom. [Danny: WHISPERING] I think mom is scared good thing we've sorted out this missiles business. [Mom:] No, they're great. They don't even seem scared. No, it's Jim. I'm worried. I know. I know. Boys, would you like to talk to grandma? [Danny:] Hi grandma! Uh-hum. A-ha. Hmm. [Music] [Danny:] Do you think these will really make it over to Cuba? [Miles:] I, yeah, of course. I mean, if we add side fins any smaller it probably wouldn't. But, I added an extra inch to each side so we should be fine. And, if that fails, then, we have this. I special ordered it from NASA. It super propels the rocket no matter where you want it to go. [Birds: TWITTERING] [Dad: COUGHS] [Dad:] I found a way to solve this missile situation. We're going to build a bomb shelter. [Mom:] A bomb shelter? [Dad:] Yeah. [Mom:] How are we going to put up a bomb shelter? [Dad:] I had Larry draw up the plans. Marian. [Dad: COUGHS] We are going to put up a concrete home right out in the back yard. [Mom:] I've got more bread in the oven. [Birds: TWITTERING] [Dad:] Okay, that's it boys. 14 feet. Now pull the string tight. Push it in right there. Let me figure out the hypotenuse see if this squares up [Danny:] Are we really going to live here? [Dad:] Well if anything hits us this will be our new home. [Danny:] Should we tell him about our plan? [Miles:] No, he's preoccupied. [Mom:] I just think we should wait and see what Kennedy does before we start carving up the back yard. [Dad:] Kenned... Kennedy is a moron. It's not like he can just make the missiles go away. Alright, alright, alright fine. We'll wait a couple of days but if he doesn't manage something soon I'm going to start digging. [Mom:] Thanks, Jim. [Miles:] We'll leave right after the lunch. [Music: 60's instrumental] [Herring gulls: KEENING] [Music: 60's instrumental] [Rocket: BLAST] [BANG] [Miles:] It's okay. Sometimes that happens. That's why we got two. [Music: 60' instrumental continues] [Rocket: BLAST] [Music: 60's instrumental continues] [Danny:] This is really going to work. [Danny:] Mom, dad, can we turn on the news? [Mom:] Go ahead. [TV: ON] [TV: Music] [TV News anchor:] A final chapter in the Cuban crisis is brought to a close as President Kennedy holds a news conference to announce that Soviet bombers on Cuban soil would be withdrawn by Russia. This are the plans that Castro claimed he would not relinquish. But Mr. Kennedy says that he has a pledge right from the Kremlin. [TV President Kennedy:] I have today been informed by Chairman Khrushchev that all of the IL-28 bombers now in Cuba will be withdrawn in 30 days. He also agreed that these planes can be observed and counted as they leave. [Toilet: FLUSHING] [Light: OFF] [Dad:] Say it. Say it, Mary. Say whatever it is you want to say. [Mom:] Jim, please listen. I'm taking the boys to my parents next week. [Dad:] For how long? [Mom:] I don't know. [Dad:] Trust! [Mom:] It's true, please. [Danny:] Miles, we really did it. Is everything okay? [Miles:] Yeah, everything is fine. Can we go to the beach again tomorrow? [Miles:] The beach? We don't have any more rockets to launch. [Danny:] I know. We did it! But I had fun. We don't have to save America every day to go to the beach. [Miles:] Okay, let's go. [Song: Stand By Me by Ben E.
