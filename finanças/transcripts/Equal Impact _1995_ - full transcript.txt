Already there seems to be a lot of tension in the arena tonight as this is the first time these two men have met in competition. Bobby Souk representing WKKA, a new Karate organization headed by a local businessman Donald Moss. Honor is Mark Bane by Souk stare down as the two come into the ring to shake hands. And Bobby Souk sending a message early, he's here to take Conner's title. David Conner comes out uncharacteristically aggressive, and lands an early point with a front kick. Conner with his exclusive jumping side kick to the neck of an extremely perplexed Bobby Souk. And Souk grabbing Conner out of kidney punches as the referee steps in to break up the fight. This could be grounds for disqualification. No, they will continue the fight. And an awesome jump spinning back kick and this baby is the challenger. Yes the referee has stopped the match. Only one minute thirty six seconds for the first round. Once again, David Conner has defended his title There's mayhem right now in the ring, as Bobby Souk comes after Conner.

The word is domination Conner dominated Souk from the start but they've arrived on... Tonight we've got Shirley out of Shoreline, go ahead Shirley on Sports Talk. Yeah, hi. I had a little comment about Josh Conner. He used to be really good, what happened to him? You know, that's an excellent point. Couple years back those guys were one and two.

First time caller. I love the show. I was hoping to talk about this Conner Souk fight. Yeah Well, you know. I don't know. It's just seems like in a real fight that Souk could probably kick Conner's ass I mean in this tournament it's just point sparring. That's why they call it a sport, Ed. What a prick. And he's an instructor? Yeah. Where? World Karate and Kung Fu Association I've never heard of that. New in town. You know, guys like that just piss me off.

Keep it running. You left the door open, I figured you'd be back. Any word on Dave? No. I wanted to talk to you about that money you spent at the cafe last night. You know about that? What about it? Where'd you get it? I found it. Put your hands up against the wall, you're under arrest. You've gotta be joking. I said, up against the wall. Gimme your left hand. Go, go! This is twelve-charlie-four. Go ahead, twelve charlie four. Have all units on the look out for an early ninties Honda. License Repeat that last part. Forget it. [Evil Laughing] You're a pretty girl. A real pretty girl. You're a real pretty girl. Sick fuck. Yeah. That's why they hired me. But I grow on ya. You know what I mean? Let's see what we got here. You like it rough? Yeah, I bet you like it that way. Ain't that so? Don't you fucking touch her. You had your chance. Now you're all mine. Get rid of Berman's body. Use the incinerator. [Knock, Knock, Knock] Angel? It's Josh Conner. What do you want? Who's she? Karen. Dave's wife. This is Ray something. Make yourself at home. We need your help. They've got Dave at a warehouse. They're gonna kill him. Whose gonna kill him? The people who run World Karate and Kung Fu. They're new in town. How do you know it's them? I was just there. Anything left of him? Look, we just need to find that warehouse. Why don't you call Lieutenant Pitts. Because now the cops are after me. Why? I took some money off a dead guy last night. You what? Did you tell Pitts? No. What'd you do with the money, Josh? I've still got it. Let me see it. You shit. They're gonna kill him because of you. You fuck. No wonder Pitts wants to talk to you. This moneys counterfit. But you're right about one thing. They're gonna kill him to get this back. If this shit hits the streets this towns gonna be crawling with FBI and secret service. And you can bet whoever printed this money doesn't want that to happen. Just tell me where the goddamn warehouse is. My guess is South King, 4th and 5th street. That area is deserted at night. I hope you're right. I owe you. You got any fire power? I don't need a gun. Hey, tough guy, in case you don't realize it this ain't no sparring match. These guys play for keeps. So do I. Your fifth degree isn't gonna stop a bullet. We don't have a choice. You interested? Yeah. But we're gonna play it my way. We don't give these guys a second chance. Got it? Two mil? Two million. How's the quality? See for yourself. Thread structure is good. But the colors a bit off. The colors fine. Fifteen cents on the dollar. We agreed on twenty. I expected a higher quality. Fifteen cents on the dollar. Take it or leave it. You think you're pretty smart, don't you tough guy? How's your eye? Looks like your times up. You're gonna die tonight. Three inch stainless. Goddamn that's impressive. Yes, that's very impressive Mr. Moss. But I'm afraid if you won't agree to the terms my business here is concluded. Concluded? Concluded? Well, I'll tell you what Mr. Dubai You agreed to twenty. Now either you accept those terms, or you're concluded. Okay, you son of a bitch! Twenty! So what's your story? About five years ago I walked in on a big drug buy. In the back of some rundown bar. I tried to walk out the same way I came in. One of the buyers came at me with a gun. I broke his neck. I shot one of the dealers. That dealer turned out to be an undercover cop. Lieutenant Pitts was the first on the scene. And when the rest of the cops arrived they put me in cuffs. And they worked me over real good. After a few days they made me an offer. Work for them and they'd drop the charges. Are you a bleeder? I bet you're a bleeder. Yeah I want a name. Okay. Please stop. I'll give you a name. Let's hear it. There's the warehouse complex up ahead here. Did you get an answer? Who? Conner. Conner? Dave Conner. You dumb fuck. I want you to kill the bitch. And make it painful. You think you're one funny bitch, don't you? Wait here for a minute, I'm gonna go check it out. Was he telling the truth? Yeah. It all fits. They think Dave has their money. I know. But I promise I'll get him out. Alive? If I have to kill ever last one of them. How you doin asshole? You're very persistent. And you're very dead. Is this about Ricky? Well, you broke his neck. I didn't have a choice. Neither do I. Yeah, that's it. Go for your gun. [Gun Shot] Josh. Ray. Ray. They're playing for keeps, Josh. Don't die on me Ray. No, not again. Slowly. Twins. Find a phone, call Lieutenant Pitts. Tell him there's gonna be a massacre. Take this. Take it! Dreg? Dreg is that you? What the hell is this supposed to be? You told me to bring him to you I really don't have time for this Mr. Moss. Relax. Mr. Conner Your lack of cooperation is most distressing. Now, perhaps my my men have not impressed on you the importance of finding that money. I don't have your money. But you know who does. Blow me. Blow me? Shoot the prick. You promised me. A promise is a promise. A promise is a promise. First I'm gonna give you a little pain. Then I'm gonna kill you. Aw, you little bitch. It's okay. It's just me. I'm gonna get you out of here. I'm going with you. It's too dangerous. Bullshit. It's payback time. Hey, I gotta use the phone. I really need to use this phone. Back off, bitch. People are so pushy. Uh, huh. Well when did you wanna do that? Oh, that sounds great. Ok, so we'll go get the guys uh, huh. It's your choice. I'll call you back. Let's see what you've got. Come on. This is too easy. You shoot him, he don't fight. You hear that? These people want a show, now you gonna give it to them? Come on, Bobby! Come on! What do you want me to do with him? Break his neck. Why don't you try me? You want your money? Yeah. You give me a go with him. Then we'll talk about it. Be my guest. Look out. Come on. Get up! Get up. Come on, Bobby. First time, do you, don't do him. You think that's gonna stop me? Yeah. You put up a pretty good fight. But uh business is business. Now where's the money? We all walk outta here, then I'll tell you where to find it. No deal. I'll uh I'll shoot him first. Now, which Karate move is it that stops a bullet? How about this one? It's okay. It's over. Now listen, Allison. It's okay. You stupid fuck. [Gun Shot] Police, everybody freeze!
