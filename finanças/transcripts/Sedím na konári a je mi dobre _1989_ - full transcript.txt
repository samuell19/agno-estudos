I cannot dance. Neither can l... but I dance. I don't know many things, but I do them. Solo for war orphans now! May I have the pleasure? Of course. Dance, orphans. We played this to circus horses. You needn't if you don't want to. A hat. If I were a man, everything would be different. You speak! Pepe, she speaks! What? Speaks! We must drink to it. Plum-brandy... Glasses are here. I neither want to hear, nor see myself. Switch the light off, intimate illumination... Long live speaking girls! We'll celebrate till the morning. Open! Open! I hear you! ?elm`ira. Answer the door! Why me? What a surprise... nice... Good evening, nobs. I am bringing you papers and books. But you seem to have affection for other things. We are practicing this kind of... culture program... ...in case we need it. Plum-brandy? I act the part of a woman. Oh, God, no! This is a chemical preparation. We don't drink that. Against pino... Oil. Yeah, oil. You see, ?elka doesn't believe us. I hope you will get over it. And read what I brought you. Yes, tonight. I take the record-player. And give up the market money-making. Holy Virgins of gingerbread! You spread obscurantism. And what is more, illicitly. I can't bear it anymore. I can't get along with it... alone. I fear to sleep in the darkness. My closest relations stayed there. They are dead. Dad, mom... Don't think about that. You are alive. I don't want to live. I'll get rid of my repulsive, dirty body. I hate it! You are cold. Go to bed. Lie down. And sleep. Don't worry. I'm here with you. Why do I live? I don't know. I'm just an ordinary man. Do you want me? Find me. God himself kissed me. What have you done? Are you all right? It's not my fault she finds me attractive. I wish you had broken your neck, you asshole! I impress her. What's up? It hurts. It's broken. You'll need plaster. How will I shave? Don't know. How will you clean your arse? I thought you would work again on the railway. Trains are operating again. They need people. I have travelled enough. What's up with you? I want a trade license. You've changed completely. Are you going to get married? Perhaps I was born to be a baker. We made something for you. It looks just like the real one. Only needs tobacco for his pipe. What a beauty! Jozef Visarionovi?. I knew you would understand. That we would follow the same path. Can you make it of marble? He bears a resemblance, doesn't he? It's beautiful. And delicious, sweet. We made him life-like. It is difficult to prepare a good paste. Try it. It is a waste. ?elka, try it. Unfortunate man! What have you done? You've desecrated the Father of nations! Tell him, comrade Kornet! You've cut off the ear of the greatest man in the world! We can make many such... We have a mould. I'll marry her. My father can turn in the grave, I'll marry her... ...though she is a Jew. Why you? What gives you the right...? Ester is like me. Crazy, ethereal, subtle... I love her, do you understand? I love her... Love, love... ...comedian! You're using words a real man says only once in his life. Such a lady-killer is only for powdered hussies! We shall see. Let her decide. Today. Agreed. And the loser? He will leave and never show up again. Ester! An important matter! An important question! Did she break out? Ester?! She's run away. What's up? Looking for your lady? I saw her up there... ...at noon. Where? Up there? Ester, where are you...? Ester! I've got her. Is she alive? Why did you do that? I meant it well... She has a fever. We'll cal for a doctor. It's not necessary. Massage with vinegar water will do. I was with the ambulance. You said you'd been a driver. Yes, the ambulance driver. Pepe, she is pregnant. Ester, are you with child? That beats me! Go out! It hurts! You bloody son of a bitch! I did nothing to her. I swear by my father! What about swearing by old Berousek? Clown! It's not possible. Count... When did she come here? Who could have done it to her? An angel flew over. Maybe you're right. Maybe I am in this world just for such a woman. Old Berousek used to say. We are single men, we are fine. We go with girls anytime. But you, married men, you must stay in, stay with your old women. Merry Christmas! Do Jews have the infant Jesus? Esterka, this is for you... form the infant Jesus. Nothing but beauty! Try it on! Everything is yours. ...and this. Dance now! Turn round! Dance, Ester! You're beautiful! I never want to dance again. I danced during the whole war. I longed for life... I am damned now. Why am I here? Why didn't I go with you? How can I forget what will happen? Do you understand that? She doesn't know what she is saying. What camp was it she could have danced at? What are you doing? My number is fading. Nobody will believe it about the concentration camp. Hang on... Excuse me. Can I see your number? I haven't been to the concentration camp. I haven't told you anything like that. She would be skinny, from the concentration camp. Is she Ester? Perhaps she's not Hebrew at all. What does it matter? The seventh... No, the eighth at least. The movements have ceased. more boys than girls are born. So, it will be a boy. To avoid infection... ...we need a clean sheet and a lot of water. We'll catch the baby in the cloth and wait till he cries. If not... Tommy guns! Murderers! Bandera's group! The caliber 26 machine gun. Is it here? It has started! Escape! The hat! Hold on to me! I dropped a chapter. She won't bear without the book! Run away if you want to survive. Hold her! It will be over soon. She bites. Water! Breathe like a dog. Mr. ZbonË·k! Water! Bite into it! Hurry up with the water! Wrap her up. It's a girl. Beautiful like her mom. We'll need milk. Who are you? Nobody, so far. But only at the moment of your birth. And then it begins. Mother Jew, father Mohammedan, uncle a fascist, grandfather a communist. And the fight begins. There are ups and downs... She's hungry. I don't want to live. I want nothing. Hey, artists! The order is for everybody! Why did you stay? Don't play at being heroes. Go into the town. Bandera's group roam about. They kill everybody. We can defend ourselves. I was on the front for two years. I don't want to mess in your affairs, but you should go to the Register of Births. And something else. We need talented men for the election. Whenever you like. We must win. Long live politics! Long live elections! Warm milk at noon. Give her a dry nappy if she cries. Let me do it. I used to shave my daddy. We won't lock you here, but don't leave the house. We are back by the evening. Come on, Pepe! Slovaks! Work was always our lot! We went to bed with work, we got up with work. It is also our party's programme. Party of work! Vote for communists, everything will be yours! Cows, horses, factories! Long live Stalin! ...Bene?! ...Kornet! Partisans salute May Day! Today gingerbread is gratis... tomorrow wine, champagne, women! Vote for ?elka, No 3! We thank Stalin for a happy life! The nationalization and land reform will bring social justice! Vote for Gottwald, vote for a better life! Who's not with us, is against us! Smile! Hold it! Hitler, listen, Stalin read you a lesson! Let's have a beer, Janko. To our mayor! He shouldn't be here! He didn't take part in the Uprising. What do you mean by that? I fought... I was on the front abroad. Ask for the Slovaks there! Do you think that the Uprising was only in your village? I am a woman too. I want to love too. I know this is not a good time for it... We must fight, build, but... What is it? It's so hard... A gun. Let it be. The functionary also has the right to love. Carefully. Will it shoot? It is secured. Undress me... I want you, make love to me... We have equal rights, the future belongs to us. Mac??ek! Hey, comrade Mac??ek! What's up? Go to hell! She's come. Who has come? A comrade. You don't know her. Send her to hell! It is May Day but we lie about like reactionaries. Stay here. Next time. Don't leave, please. I must. You know you mustn't come to town. If you knew what they are doing to her. I have seen it. Traitor! You don't understand me. You don't understand anything! But I am strong... ,,, strong. I laugh... ...laugh. That goat is brighter than she is. Is it possible? You cannot stay alone with the baby. Don't cry. Leave it. Can't you see she's hungry? Come to your prettier dad. Here is our Lisa. She gives us milk. And here is mummy. She will play something. Here you are, your good pap. Ester, put it down! You bitch! You wanted to kill her! I did! And you and myself! What kind of a person are you? All of them. The child is a creature of God. Kill me! Forgive me, Ester. I am accustomed to beating. I was always beaten when I refused somebody. I could not oppose. I wanted to live. I paid for my life by myself with words: The end of the War is drawing near. And the baby... ...is innocent, Ester. I am not Ester. She was my classmate at the boarding school in M?hlbach. Once I spent a holiday here. As I am alone I came here. And I found you. We love you. I know. I know. I am proud to know you. My picture has never been in the paper. Is that us? Let's have a drink! I can fetch you a newspaper. Gratis. You'll pay when you find the gold. What would you do with it? Gold brings bad luck. Cheers. To the baby! Where is my bicycle? Thief! Thief! Thief! Bicycle! He took it to pieces. Must have been nuts. The Register is not a railway station. The birth is registered within a week, and your child is almost one year old. Of course, you went to the priest and let the office be. Sorry. Religion? Is it necessary? O.K. Undenominational. Father? Father? You shouldn't have come with her. Which of you is the father? Madam Register, none of us. Father unknown. If need be... I could be the father. Why you? Put down my name! No, mine! Put down mine! How dare you? You are drunk! Sorry, we are a complicated family. Come when you are sober. That didn't go very well, did it? Bloody ink-slingers. What are you doing here? Coming from the Register. At last! You should get married now. Wedding? Why not. I will take her away. Into the town. Everybody looks at her like at a circus horse. She doesn't belong in such a hole. It is your home, mate. Ester, we come wooing! We were at the Register! Your bridegrooms are here! Where is the gold? Ester! ...come out! She took the gold! We gave it to her. She has gone again. I don't understand it. She was O.K. She left us and the baby. You see, we are clever. A big love, no making love, and we are stuck with the baby. It's terrible... Look what she's done. The devil must have got into her. Ester, come home! The baby needs you. I am not in the world to make roots here. And the baby? Place her in an orphanage. In Rakova's manor house. Trench-mortars. Machine-gun. To the town with them! Hurry up! They were about thirty, but the war is over. They are the last victims. Where is your lady? Gone to her aunt's. She ran away. And left the child. She might have gone with those... Oh no, she was a Jew. That's not for certain. Who knows what she was. We are destined for each other. You're right. We will be fine together. Yes, we are fine. Sing, Pepe. We are single men, we are fine. I will lead you, shape you. Shape me. I'll make a man of you... ...outstanding and powerful. You mustn't sleep. Wake up! Want me! We'll bite each other like dogs. I'll wake you up. In the morning, ?elka. Don't sleep. I'll wake you up. Good-bye. And what'll we two do? Let's kneed dough. We must work. Have you got a light, madam? Mac??ek! Pepe! Get off! Come back! Stop playing the fool! Pepe, she hasn't left. It was them. They wanted the bloody gold. We shouldn't have left her alone. Forgive us, Ester. Where do you have water here? you're not funny chaps at all. You are pale. Wash at home. Can't you spare some water? Go away, please. Leave me alone! Go to hell! What did you say? To hell with you! you'll be sorry for that! Halt! Hands up! You nobodies! You don't know me yet! But I shall wait. I'll wait for you. And God said: Let the Earth bring forth the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind. Didn't we grow on the tree like apples? But we don't want to fall down. It's freezing, but we are still on the branch. Who is doing better than me? Some children don't have daddies, I have two. I have two daddies. Like a wizard. What are you saying, L`iza? Be silent, will you? Ester, we want to eat! Come, we are hungry. L`iza talks such nonsense... Like Pepe, doesn't she? The dancer in Paris now! Cancan! She is a pioneer. Going to the meeting. I love cancan, you love meetings. We are of different stuff. Prengel of dough, me of paste, Ester of batter. A sea of sweet dreams, and mom sends an angel to kiss Ester once and once again, and then he flies to dad Pepe to keep guard over Ester till the morning. Good night. She must go to school in autumn. It cannot be avoided. Do you want to avoid me? You would be eaten by dirt without me. You don't want to wash. Don't be so strict. If you ran away, I would marry the seven dwarves. And old Kri?tof`ik too? Oh no, he stinks. Did you hear the news? Your teacher Kornet has shown his true colours! The great functionary was a shady creature. They locked him up and took all of his medals. the great Mr. Uprising. When was he arrested? Yesterday. He worked in a treasonous centre. Well, well... Ester, come here, at once! What have you done? How is that? Let me be! Confess it! You've destroyed the only remembrance of Mom! I have destroyed nothing! I'm going now. She glued it on the heart. God, I'm so stupid. Pull! Our gold! She is a princess! Where did you find it? On the branch. Ester hid it on the tree. Bloody gold! She was murdered for it! Take it off! It is my treasure. We'll save it for you. Give it here! I'll leave you! Forever! Stop scowling. It is your treasure. It must be hidden. Otherwise it is not treasure. But I want to play with it first. What shall we play? Something by Mahler. Long skirts are in fashion now. Thank you, Daddies. We wish you to grow up... ...and to grow wise. Let us all be together forever! Blow! One, two, four, six, seven. Black Day! Generalissimo Stalin died! Hey, bakers! Even trees weep. It is mourning. Am I... drunk? Mahler's gold. Sons of a bitch! They've pinched it! From me, an honest citizen! Comrade lady chairman, may I leave? You are a witness, comrade, stay here. Bring the evidence. You can type. my gold. There is no justice in the world. It is a misunderstanding. A complicated story. I stole only the bicycle. I confess that. We'll make out the record at the station. We'd rather stay here. Here ?elka can... Sit down! Madam comrade knows us. She can explain... What do you want to explain? We fulfilled the five-year plan in four years but what are you? Subversive elements. sponges, abuse our goodness. You'd have been hanged after the war. What's up? What about the girl? You offended against the law about precious metals. You are suspected of profiteering and acting against nationalization. Even if you were telling the truth, you should have informed us of the find. Don't worry, darling. We are going to go by car. I'm not going! Catch her! There she is, on the tree! What do you want here? Daddies! This is our tree! I don't want to go with you! Prengel... Pepe... help! Sign it. The value is about one million four hundred crowns. Go away! I am not going with you! Hold her! Leave me alone! Help! She bites, the little bitch! We are building socialism form nothing and you lie in gold! Speculators! Daddies! Don't give me to them! I want to be with you. We may be born just for this very moment. Don't give me to them! Get on! Leave! Be glad to leave! You'd run wild with them. I wouldn't! We'll bring you up to be a citizen of the new society. I did fool you, didn't I? Kri?tof`ik cannot be imposed on so easily. After all, justice does exist. Move! Hear me? Faster! Faster! Did you know that an artificial earth satellite was just launched. With a rocket. You can hear the music everywhere. You leave on such a great day. You don't deserve such luck. I hope you'll behave. I hope you drew a lesson from the sentence. You are young. You can leave. Good-bye. The satellite will fly over at 4.00 p.m. It will not be seen in the sunshine. Now you can listen to its typical sound. Master! Is that you? You came back. I was released. It is good. And where is that friend of yours? That comedian? I don't know. And where is our girl? Come. We will find her. Don't run! Pay attention! This is our headmistress. Good morning. What's the torch for? I want to be a princess. You are. Beautiful like a Christmas tree. It's fantastic! You are here too! Daddy! My little princess! Be careful! It's fragile! Do you speak Czech again? I was taught. Prengel, I am weeping. You old comedian! You made me cry! Comrades! Here are the results of the competition of the ideologically most valuable mask. The third prize goes to ?ofia, a tractor driver. Congratulations! the second is Jaroslav in the mask of comrade Tencer. And now... The winner is Ester! Her mask is a symbol of progress, the Soviet Sputnik! Congratulations! What's up? Are you weeping? She weeps for joy, because it's a nice day for her. I didn't have such in my youth. We have reached for the stars. We are becoming the masters of nature. That is why we shall go on helping to keep peace and progress in the world by our work. Stop weeping. You are the winner. I am laughing now. And I will always laugh because I'm yours. Ours, even when you are not with us. I want to be only with you, forever. You will be. Don't worry. Who will be the first up? Do you know what old Berousek said when counting money? Of course I do. Maybe I was born for this very moment. Right, for this moment... We are fine. We are single men, we are fine. We go with girls anytime. But you, married men, you must stay in, stay with your old women. Starring: Cast: Music:
