Betty Grant Winsley, aka Lady Winsley, 40, American. Died on the night of Sunday, February 19, 2017. Killed by a gunshot. No prints on the bullet. The weapon is a 9 mm. A Beretta 92 Parabellum. An old model. - How do you know? - The mark on the bullet. That model had a design defect. It was withdrawn after a few months. Nothing under her nails. The bruises? She was dragged along. We found strands of her hair. And a drop of blood. - Time of death? - 12:15 am. Was she beaten? No, there are no traces of violence, apart from the gunshot. No strangulation, no bruising. Any sexual violence? May Allah forgive you! Surely you don't expect me to check that? You're not a pathologist? No. Just a nurse. I can't abide dead bodies! Me neither. I was expecting you. I'm the maid. Who's there? Burak Ozturk, journalist with the island's daily. Who allowed you in? My press card. The police captain knows. I'm taking over the case. I don't want the press here. Did you know Lady Winsley? We all knew her. - But you're a journalist. - She never gave me an interview. I insisted, but she wouldn't tell me a thing. About what? About what an American novelist was doing here in winter. It could have promoted our island. A journalist who cares about his country. How patriotic of you! But I am a patriot, inspector. Can I help you, sir? - Inspector Fergan. - For the American woman... Captain... I didn't know the investigation had begun. The Americans are demanding results. We've questioned the four main suspects. The victim, Lady Winsley. The gardener. His brother, Davut. He found the body. And the last man to see her alive, Sercan Birol. The interrogation reports. I hate taking over an investigation, I hate a scene being polluted, and I loathe journalists. Do you mean Burak? He's a decent guy. He knows a lot, he can help you. It's a small island. People know each other. Plus, they're all related. - Cigarette? - I quit. What did Lady Winsley come here for? I don't know. We're counting on you to find that out. Be worthy of your reputation. What reputation? Here, we exaggerate to make a compliment credible. So, you'd never heard of me? - How about you? - Had you heard of me in Istanbul? Why should I have? You again? My daughter manages this place. She won't be long. Anything to tell me? Inspector? Breakfast's at 7:30. Smoking isn't allowed, neither here, nor downstairs. The bar opens at 5 pm, but we don't serve alcohol after 8 pm. To get drunk, try the End Bar on the corniche, but watch out for the cliffs. I only change the sheets on request. New ones are eight liras extra. Five liras for room service. Three liras for TV, five if you watch over an hour a day. The police don't pay for extras. They're not free. I'm just letting you know. If you need anything, just ask. There is no TV. I'm Azra. - Fergan. - Inspector Fergan. Thank you. - Hello, dear? - Hello, Mum. - Not too tired? - No, I'm not tired. - Tried my baklava? - I'm not hungry. - Is it dangerous there? - I'm not scared. - I saw my clairvoyant... - Mum... - Be careful. - Mum, I'm not in any danger. - I have a bad feeling. - Mum... - When'll you be back in Istanbul? - You forgot my cloves. The islands are rich in dark tales of clan or racial wars, or ancient murders... All those stories are legends, passed on to preserve our values. This Lady Nestlé probably bore us a grudge. - Not Nestlé, Lady Winsley. - Same difference. Be wary of women writers. I told her to enjoy the beach and the sea, rather than awake old demons. She told me to stay out of it. She needed a lesson, but no one ever imagined such a tragedy. Far from it. - We're counting on you, Inspector... - Fergan. Musa, Eray, Ismail, Burhan, Kasim, Ahmet and Hikmet. He's your American's gardener. Who's that? Him? That's Birol. A great and noble veterinarian who did a lot for this island. Our fathers were cousins. This is Davut, my brother. He took Lady Winsley bread and milk each day. - Do you speak English? - No, but I was learning. To talk to her. To say what? I'd say, "Do you love Büyükada Island? Do you love fish?" She didn't understand and asked, "What love?" Then I replied, "Love. You love Büyükada." She said, "Yes, I love it." And she smiled at me. She was beautiful. On February 20, when you found the body, did you see anyone near the house? No, I didn't. I told the police. Inspector! I saw my brother, his son, the maid and Kasim's son Fuat. I also saw Tevfik, Abdullah, Macit, Sadik, Emin, and my cousin, Feyyaz. All right. Thank you. Lady Winsley ate her last meal here. She sat there and began with a glass of raki. No other women drink here, understand? - Lady Winsley loved life. - You fancied her? I'm too old. I'm not into American women. They're too domineering. That bothers me. But, believe me, all the local men were under her charm. Understand? - She'd talk to people, ask stuff. - Ask stuff? Too many questions, understand? I understand, yes. I understand Kant, Kierkegaard, Ibn-i Haldun, Friedrich Engels, Zhang Zhu, Ludwig Josef Johann Wittgenstein... Not Liechtenstein. So why wouldn't I understand you? What about? What did you see that night? She left on foot with Sercan. He came back alone shortly after. Understand? I didn't do anything. Maybe. But you were the last to see her alive. Were you her lover? I just walked with her. She stopped to ask the time. It was 11:30 pm. I went with her part of the way, then I came back. - You didn't walk her home? - No. - Why not? - She refused. Lady Winsley charmed men, but never let them get close. I didn't kill her. Good night. What are you doing? I'm out of syringes. Saliva is just as good for DNA testing. Need anything else? You can go. - Fuat? - Yes, inspector. - Heard about Lady Winsley? - Everyone's talking. It's terrible. - So, you knew her? - No, only by reputation. Where were you on the evening of February 19? - What day was that? - A Sunday. I missed the last ferry from the port. I slept at my uncle's. - Who's that? - Burak, the journalist. - Is that a cut? - From army training. I hope it heals soon. Thank you. I want to see Lady Winsley's body again. The Americans collected it last night. Still angry? Need a ride back? I have to digest a heavy dinner. Where have you been? You're more curious than me, inspector! I advise you not to return to the crime scene. By the way, it's a 27-minute walk to Lady Winsley's manor. 27 minutes exactly. YOUNG MAN MURDERED? Do you sell cloves? Sorry, no. Too bad. Who sells them? I carry some since I stopped smoking. - How long? - What? Since you stopped. Six months. One month. Do you know English? A little. - What does "vinter" mean? - Winter. Autumn. Spring. Summer. - And "susspet"? - Suspect. What else... "Disapparanche"... Disappearance. And "murdar"? Murder. That's it, inspector. We have him. - Have who? - The killer. Sercan Birol's the killer. His DNA is close, but not identical, to the blood in Lady Winsley's eye. - Your report says it is. - It's close enough to arrest him. My son is not the killer. May we come in? I'm Sercan's brother. This is my great-uncle's father. My cousin's little cousin. Sercan's wife. My cousin's younger son. My two uncles. My cousin's sister-in-law. My aunt's son-in-law, Abdul Berik. My uncle's brother. We only need DNA from the immediate family. His aunt's brother. His wife's brother and her son. Clark Gable? My father. You wouldn't be here, if he were around. - I'd like to see him. - All right. Go out, turn left, walk a kilometre, third row in the cemetery. - When did he die? - 15 years ago. - How? - Struck by lightning. - His occupation? - Veterinarian. People were fond of him. He solved problems. My family is respected. Remember that. - Is that a threat? - No. Just information. Inspector... Please don't ask me to do that again. I'm from here. They're all my cousins. Every result is close to our DNA. Yes. Yet not one is exactly identical. In that case, who killed Lady Winsley? What is it? I'm thinking. Miss... Do you have ice cream? Ice cream? Yes, ice cream. Do you know about a murder here some years ago? - When exactly? - In 2000. A young man was killed. That's long ago. I vaguely remember. Aren't you on Lady Winsley's case? Why ask about that? What's your work method? I don't have a method. I trust my intuition. So, what does your intuition tell you about this murder? - Why do you ask? - I'm curious. As curious as your mother. Just a second. - Who are you? - Let go of my son! - Why was he at the manor? - You have odd methods! He keeps running off. You went to her place? Answer! No, it was the journalist who... - The journalist? - No, no journalist. - He said journal. - Journalist! His uncle is at a journal. I represent the Birol family. The uncles, nephews, nieces, cousins and aunts. I'd like to know why we're here. I summoned you. I need DNA from everyone related to Birol the veterinarian. What for? To find Lady Winsley's killer. Is it clear now? Captain, we know each other well. You know we could never kill a foreigner! Since the Istanbul inspector arrived, I wonder who commands here. You or him? I do, of course! So, who decided to do the DANA testing? You or him? - Not DANA, Ismail, DNA. - Shut up! Him. Who decided to summon us? Him. So, what do you decide, captain? I decide all the rest. Nurse! Come in. You have no choice, miss. Kasim: negative. Ismail: negative. Ahmet: negative. Tevfik: negative. Burak: negative. Musa: negative. Abdullah: negative. Rasit: negative. So, who killed Lady Winsley? Something's not right. Is anyone from Birol's circle missing? No. Only old Birol. And he's been dead 15 years. After 15 years, what do you hope to find in my husband's personal things? - They can help. - How? My father's belongings. He treated the island's horses, dogs and cats for 40 years. He was against sterilization. We're overrun now. May God make you sterile. May God give you piles. May the pain keep you from sitting. May you suffer a slipped disc and a painful operation. May a woman seduce you only to betray you... Then you'll see. Damn cop! ID card. You cheap... Driving licence and address book. I'll keep them. The dead seem to meddle in the affairs of the living. It's my guess old Birol didn't just look after local dogs and cats, but the women too. He must have left a few illegitimate children here. Take this stamp. I need the DNA of the person who licked it 30 years ago. Ok, but we're all cousins here. I know. Why a stamp? That stamp could be the key. Your father's memory is soiled. Our family honour is betrayed! Even if I had been her lover, I'm innocent! - So why do they suspect you? - I don't know. The blood in her eye resembles mine, but they agree it's not mine. It's not mine! And us? Why suspect us? - Why take our blood? - Calling me guilty? Yes, you're guilty. You're the reason they suspect us. Shame on you. Show your brother some respect! Get out! My love, tell me, did you sleep with that American, Lady Winsley? The police want her killer, not her lover. But tell me, did you sleep with her? You believe that? No. It's likely that the blood in Lady Winsley's eye matches old Birol's DNA exactly. What are you trying to prove? The DNA shows that, but he died 15 years ago. - And? - And? And? - What? - Think. I am thinking. An error. No. Sercan, the main suspect, couldn't have killed her 15 minutes after leaving the bar. His DNA doesn't match anyway. Davut was in love with her. He wouldn't have done so clean a job. As for the gardener, I doubt it. And so? Old Birol visited local homes. He must have fathered children. It's my belief that the killer is one of them. Let's cast a wide net. The adulterous mother will lead to the murdering son. We look for adulterous women? Out of the question! - We must respect family honour. - No need to mention adultery. What then? We're after the killer's mother? "Inspector Fergan, a super cop sent to solve Lady Presley's murder is abandoning the Birol family lead to focus on local women." Who killed Lady Presley? It's not Lady Presley, it's Lady Winsley. - There's a rotten apple in the barrel. - Who can it be then? Someone who worked for her. It could be the gardener. I think it's a love affair that ended badly. They're only trying so hard because she was American. Americans love scandals. This Presley woman was mysterious. I bet she had something in mind to come and spend winter here. What are these DANA... DNA tests on our women? Quiet! Aren't you ashamed, my niece? You see, there was blood in the victim's left eye. And old Birol was a veterinarian, so... So what? It's simple. Logical. Why the left eye? Would the right one change anything? Nothing at all, but it was the left one. We refuse to do the test. If the Americans want a blood sample, let them send the marines. This is a free country. We do what we want, we kill whom we want. And sleep with whom you want? Is that it? Come on, out! What does Lady Nestlé's left eye have to do with the infidelity of local women? Action... reaction! Logical, isn't it? Logical. It's a conspiracy. A conspiracy! Tell me the truth. Did Birol ever touch you? Touch me? Did cousin Birol ever touch you? What are you saying, Ismail? For fuck's sake! Did Birol make a cuckold of me? - A cuckold? - Yes, a cuckold! Did Birol fuck you? If I die now, what will you say over my grave? "Born an ass, died an ass." Fatma: negative. Lady Winsley's maid: negative. Azize: negative. Good, she's the muezzin's wife. - Did you see Birol a lot? - Why? - Did you frequent him? - Everyone frequented him. None of us went near Birol. Except your uncle's daughter, Seda. And my sister-in-law, Ayse. - The truth! - I never slept with the veterinarian. - I never cheated on you. - Slut! Lale: negative. Burak's mother: negative. The hairdresser: negative. Surprisingly. Ahmet, we've loved each other so much. Remember our honeymoon... My sister-in-law, Sureyya... and also my uncle's sister-in-law, Fatma. What? - Mondays or Tuesdays? - Not Mondays. I saw him on Tuesdays. Listen to me. In the name of Allah... Spare me the truth. The schoolteacher: negative. The baker's wife: negative. The pharmacist: negative. - Wednesdays? - Not Wednesdays, Thursdays. I nursed you through your accident. And now prostate cancer. I'm starting to think you've jinxed me! She was my father's cousin. You're expected. The investigation must be suspended. We've lived in harmony for generations. Everything is peaceful here. We get on well with our police force. Their laws are ours. But we don't like your methods. You dishonour our women. We've lost a cousin due to you. So, a word of advice. Finish your job and get out of town. - Believe me, I'm working on it. - Really? Inspector... You're going too far. - You think so? - I'm a woman too. So, let us men talk together! Really? You can talk outside then! All of you, get out! Get the hell out, I said! I've looked into our inspector and his family. The inspector's a Kurd. And? He's from a family of sheep breeders in Diyarbakir. So what, Burak? How are an American writer and sheep linked? - It doesn't bother you? - No. What if he isn't Turkish? He's excellent at his job. I don't care either, but he's a Kurd! Don't you get it? Well, Mehmet? I'm a democrat and always vote to the left of the left. But some races pollute the Earth. Fergan has no place in our society. Hello, Mr. Kasim. May I ask your wife a question? Ask me any questions. We don't have your wife's results. What are you implying? Are you doubting my honour? Sorry, I expressed myself badly. We've lost your wife's results. LADY WINSLEY'S MYSTERIOUS DEATH A VICTIM OF LOVE? AUTHOR FOUND DEAD Where was your son on the evening of February 19? February 19, a Sunday evening? He took the last ferry back to his base, as usual. - Was there a cut on his cheek? - No. Thank you. A Turk and a Kurd are sentenced to die. They ask the Kurd what his last wish is. He says it's to see his mother. Then they ask the Turk his. He replies, "That the Kurd doesn't see his mother." There are no Kurds. Listen now... Your articles on corruption at the water board were excellent. Those on clandestine brothels too. The one on contaminated raki was good as well. But you're way off the mark with this. For 80 years, the State has tried to make them forget their roots. You'll stir things up. There are no Kurds here. You know how your feet sound in snow... Kard... Kurd... "Fergan's Kurdish roots are finally out in the open." Fucking Kurds! I knew it! "Inspector Fergan is striving to find a culprit "among the inhabitants of the island. "His methods are outrageous." "His hatred for his country and admiration for the Americans..." See your inspector now? Hello. So that's it? You'll give up and leave? I'll never see you again? Immediate departure for Istanbul. Mum... Why haven't you ever told me about our roots? Forget that. When I do, people remind me. I won't tell you anything. Why not? Those who want to erase my memory have won. But why did you let them win? For you, my son. So that you could live. That's why I sent you to Germany. Talk anytime. My son... When you were born, we had 10 hectares of farmland, 8,000 head of sheep, and we were the richest family in Piran. All of Turkey wore the wool of our sheep. But, one day, an epidemic decimated our flock. After that, the repression increased. We lost it all: the land we had cultivated, the trees we had planted, the mountains that protected us. We moved to Ankara. Your dad was an honest, proud man. He found a job as a worker. But he could never take the injustice of it... and he fell ill. One November night, he lay down. I didn't notice anything. When I took his morning tea and his pills, he was dead. You had just turned four. His dream was to see you grow up and succeed in life. And you have succeeded. You can be proud of yourself. I am proud of you. We are strangers to our memory, to our language, to our own faces. I have always felt exiled. Exile uproots everything but the roots. We come from the East. And the sun rises in the East. Talk! Sercan, I'm speaking to you! This is Sercan Birol. I was under pressure to arrest someone. - It wasn't him! - His latest DNA test is very positive! - A golden opportunity. - But it wasn't his DNA. - But it's close. - Close, but not identical. Inspector, it's very close. Get him out! "Despite the endless DNA tests, Lady Winsley's killer has not been found. "Some want the case closed." Here, inspector. That's everything we have on the young man killed in 2000. Is this all? It's a very old case. Baklava? I can't, with my diabetes. I won't have many. The 2000 bullet and the latest one have the same defect. And you think? It's the same weapon. What do the two crimes have in common? Lady Winsley was writing a novel. I think it was about the young man. Trust me, I know what I'm doing. I just need proof. I need the manuscript. What do we do with Sercan? Keep him here for now. And tell the press we have the culprit. But you said it wasn't him! "Lady Winsley's murderer has apparently been found: "Sercan Birol, one of her many lovers. "It seems a family member denounced him." We'll talk again soon. Goodbye, my brother. Hello. Inspector... The case is closed. What are you after now? Nothing. I just have a few minor questions for your son. Of course. Can you come to the station? I'll get ready and be right there. Inspector... - Everything ok? - Yes. Don't screw up, Fuat! Stop! - The suspect? - That way. He's right here. Put him down. No! Down on the floor. We tested your blood. It matches the drop in the victim's eye. - It's a mistake. - No. It isn't. Tell me the truth or you'll spend your life behind bars. - Fergan's office? - That way. My son is innocent. Your son is involved somehow. He didn't kill Lady Winsley. Maybe, but I have to tell you he's a suspect. He didn't return to barracks that evening. His DNA matches the blood found in Lady Winsley's eye. I need you to trust me. The gun that killed Lady Winsley was also used to kill a man in 2000. My son only carries weapons in the army. - He has never had a gun. - I know. And your son was just a boy in 2000. Either he was asked to shoot her with that gun, or... he's not the killer. You should help me. I had relations with old Birol. Only once, a long time ago. I know. I'm scared. I give you my word. Your husband will never know. I found this in my son's room. "Suspect Number 1". Please, don't harm my son. Or my honour. The young poet's name was Azad. He was talented, but his poetry was subversive for he wrote in a forbidden language: the Kurdish language. A dedication in a book of Kurdish poetry that he had hidden since childhood was his sole hope of writing one day. It was... his bond with the words and images that had seared his soul since his identity was taken from him. Years later, he published his anthology of poetry clandestinely and settled on the island, incognito, to pursue his quest for justice and liberty in peace. The wolves of darkness discovered his identity. One night, someone knocked. Azad opened the door... He instantly recognized the young man standing before him. His threatening gaze and his strange, big eyes stared at him unambiguously. He told him, 'I'm a Turk. Your poems offend me. You write of liberty! I am a patriot! And he shot him dead. Fergan... Back in 2000, no one talked because they knew he was a Kurd. I know. Carry on, please. "The case was closed without anyone being bothered." I don't buy Fuat's confession. He says Lady Winsley attacked him and the gun went off in the struggle. I think she was dead when the blood got in her eye. I think someone else was there when she was killed. But why would Fuat protect him? I think she caught him with her manuscript. Lady Winsley tried to take it back and the second person shot her. Fuat rushed at him and they fought. Fuat's face was scratched and his blood fell on the victim's body. Aren't you mixing up investigations? That was Lady Winsley's investigation. She found the young Kurd's killer. I think the same man killed her. Fuat isn't the culprit. The killer in 2000 also killed Lady Winsley. The same gun killed both victims. Fuat was a boy. It can't be him. You must release him. I can't. If I free every suspect, what will I look like? The Americans think I'm a clown and the Turks want to replace me. - If I free him, my career's over. - You'd rather condemn an innocent? Fuat isn't innocent and you know it. But he didn't kill Lady Winsley. So, who did? I think I know. They let you go pretty fast. They believed my story. - What story? - I confused them. They're so stupid. I didn't denounce you. I'd never have done that. They want to close the case. Let's go fishing. Let's get away from here. Now? Later. All right. Traitor! - Burak Ozturk, give me your gun. - Never! You're a traitor. Damn Kurd! I knew you were the best from the very beginning. Here's the murder weapon. A Beretta 92 Parabellum. It killed Lady Winsley and the young Kurd. It's in your hands now. Goodbye, captain. Thank you. Goodbye, inspector. Last departure for Istanbul.
