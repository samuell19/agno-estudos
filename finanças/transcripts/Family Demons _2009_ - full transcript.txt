I'm taking care of things. You've spent it all, haven't you? [clank] Maybe you'd like me to kick you out of the house... and then you can see what it's really like out there. Is that what you want? Huh? No, Ma. I want to stay here with you. Stop your ranting. You're making my bloody headache worse. Ma! Not now, Billie! I'm late for work. When are you coming home?

[clock ticking] [slurred singing] You gonna kiss me, baby... What are you doing up? Couldn't sleep. Where's the food, Ma? Quit pestering me. Ma! If you won't give me any money, why don't you let me get a job? Well, how many times have I told you? It's a dangerous world out there. Very, very dangerous.

[door squeaking, closes] [gasps] Where the hell have you been? I went to the toilet. [scoffs] You went to the toilet? What do you think I am? A fucking idiot? Where the fuck were you? Where?! I went to get something to eat. You left the house! I was hungry, Ma! Ahh!!! Ma! Please don't! No, Ma! No! Shut up! No, Ma, please! I swear to God, Billie... If you mess with me, I'll fucking kill you! Do you think I enjoying doing this? Do you? [crying] Because I don't! I just want you to stop your lying. I'm sick and tired of your fucking...disobeying me. I know what you're doing, Billie. I wasn't born yesterday, you know. You going out and meeting boys, aren't ya? No, Ma. I'm not. Making out, doing drugs... Having a good time. No, I'm not doing any of those things! But you'd like to, wouldn't you?! Well, darl... So did I when I was your age. But I didn't get to... So you won't either. Billie, come here, I've made you something to eat. C'mon, honey. I didn't go all the way to the shops and back for nothing. [chains rattling] Where do you think you're going? Can't eat anymore. Stay with me, honey. Keep me company? You know I was about your age when Patrick gave me this? We were so in love. Talked about getting married, having three children. That's how many I told him I wanted. And he didn't mind. He wanted three children too. Three boys. And look what I got... A fucking girl.. A fucking bastard girl! Ma, I've heard all this before. Wasn't my fault your daddy was waiting for me, following me that day. Wasn't my fault you insisted on growing inside of me. And your grandmother... Know what she did? She beat me senseless. You remember that, Ma?! [eerie voices] Oh, shit! Ma, what is it? Ma! You were so desperate to be born. Desperate and determined to ruin my life! It's all your fault I turned out like this. It's all your fault! I - I deserve so much better. You fucked up my life. Well and truly fucked it up! Shut up, Ma. I hate you! I hate you! Shut up!!! [breathing heavily] [chains rattling on floor] Ma? Ma? Ma? Ma?! C'mon, c'mon! Somebody? Is anyone there? Somebody help! Someone? Somebody there? Help me, someone! Someone! What's going on? Are you okay? You alright? Come round to the back. Okay. This way. Is she breathing? Yeah. Is there a key for the chain? Uh... In a jar. Up there by the window. Let's get her in the car. You can see your mother now. [ominous, sustained tone plays] [eerie, faint voice] Do you want me to take you home? No. [engine starting] [slow, haunting music plays] [roar of ocean in distance] [giggling] [seagulls squawking] [eerie voice] [very dark music tones] [gasps] Piss off, bitch! Hey... You know what I feel like doing? I just want to take this car and keep driving. And go where? Anywhere. I don't care. Somewhere far from here. You should come with me. What? You mean... leave and never come back? Yeah. Well, what about my mother? What about her? Well, she's pretty sick. I can't leave her now. You've got to get out of that house, Billie. It's dangerous. If you don't leave now, you might not get another chance. I'll look after you, Billie. You know I will. [ominous, sustained tone] Okay. I'll go with you. I'll go grab my stuff. I'll come pick you up soon. You mean, we're leaving tonight? The sooner the better. [clock ticking] [engine stops] [engine cranks, turns over] [engine stalls] [echoing voices] Got you something... It's on the table. Thanks, Ma. It's beautiful. Can't say I don't do nothing for ya. You stay with me... You'll always be safe. [slow, haunting music plays] [floor creaks] Ma? Shut up! Planning on going somewhere? No. Who's the boy? After everything I've done for you, you even try to kill me. It was an accident! Bullshit! [glass shatters] [breathing heavily] Ma? Please. You're not fucking going anywhere! [screams] [intense, dark music plays] Ahh!!! [breathing frantically] [door handle rattling] [rattling at door continues] [eerie voices] Ahh!!! [crushing, cracking sounds] [crickets chirping] [clock ticking] [water dripping] [groans and struggles] [car door slams] Sean? [door slowly creaks] [knock on door] Sean? [dark music plays] [quiet clanking sound] [eerie sounds] C'mon... Get it together. [odd clipping sounds in distance] [eerie voices] [clipping sounds continue] [echoing voice] Planning on going somewhere? [intense music plays] [slow rattling, clanking of door handle] [pounding, intense music plays] [door slams] [echoing voice] Billie... [eerie music plays] [music intensifies] [screaming] [knocking at door] What's going on here? I've been knocking outside for ten minutes. What the fuck's going on? ? [footsteps] [clunk] [door creaking] [echoing voices] Hello, darling. Come lie with me. Do you understand me now, Billie? Yes, Ma. You stay with me... You'll always be safe. [phone ringing] [intermittent pounding music] [phone continues ringing] [eerie, distorted voice] phone thuds on floor] Billie? Billie? [rattling at door] Ahh!!! [sobbing] [loud clap of thunder] [rain falling] ? [screams of pain] [loud screaming] [clock ticking] [water dripping] [sad, eerie music plays] ? [music darkens, intensifies] ?
