Story and Screenplay by: Music: Sound: Editor: You, the oldest daughter, go instead of your father. Featuring: l won't, daddy, l don't want, l don't want to fight. A production by: Executive Producer: Director of Photography: Directed by: I will, daddy, I'm all right, l will go to fight, tinkle -jingle, tinkle -jingle, l will go to fight. What's going on? The driver... - What's the name of this village? - That village? Jezy. Sch?nberg during the Germans. - Where's the main office? - Right there, behind the bridge. That's them? We're just talking about it. There's no such a village. Not only in our region. ln the whole republic there's no settlement called like that. Anyway, come in! Here's the list of the municipalities, you can have a look. Why are they actually moving into a non-existing village? That's good... What sort of masters, such sort of orders! And l have the order to take them to that village. What sort of masters, such sort of orders! They've sent that order from the police as well as from the regional office. They've said it's in this region and that they're waiting for us on the state estate. My God! The eviction to a non-existing village. They've really played a trick on you! But they couldn't really mean it, if you understand... Well, it will solve itself somehow. lt's a mistake, they didn't mean it when such a village doesn't exist. But why have they evicted you? No reason to speak about it, when there's not even a village to send us to. What is not, can be! With our endless possibilities it can be arranged. You'll stay here. Even if it's not the village you're looking for. Here is the soil which needs to be tilled. Everything else is secondary. l hope you understand. We will give you as many fields as you're able to till. The space is here for everyone who has a serious intention to work. Work is the act of true freedom! What do you grow here? Just like everywhere else. You see, we are only beginning. And we really need help of people from the agriculture. Over there, they took away our land, and here they offer it to us. lt's easy to take from what's not yours and to give from what's not yours. Leave it alone, it's not our land. And where is our land? lf you wouldn't chase out all three girls to become nuns, if you would divide the estate among us, this wouldn't happen! You chased them out to become nuns not that they'd pray for you, but that you wouldn't have to give them anything! l only wanted that for your good. The girls were good, they obeyed, but you... Each one of them could have had something, as well as myself, but not everything! The convents were dissolved, we were expelled, all of us are beggars and it's all your fault! When l was giving you the estate, you were taking it like a bull with its horns. Shut up! When l gave you even the estate of your sisters, you thanked me! Shut up at last! You! The driver said he won't wait, so we unloaded it here. lt's better than on the road. The mayor walks around, orders to join the army, tinkle -jingle, tinkle -jingle, orders to join the army. Johnny, skip! Sister Klemencia! lt's undignified to mock the poor ones. Everybody calls him like that. Your answer makes me sad. l'll find out immediately. - So what is it? - The boards! Everywhere? l'm going to check it again! Pardon. To sleep on the boards when they don't have to... l don't understand them. But l do, and very well indeed. We have a whole nunnery over there. They are hardworking, but what do we look like? The headquarters are here, even the higher visits come here, and we have here a whole nunnery. What will they tell us? We shall send them to the Ludvig court. Demko proposed that already a long time ago. That place is not so visible, nobody's going there. And they can do whatever they want over there. The important thing is they will work! Don't snore, your majesty! Sister Klemencia! l was hesitant for a long time, l prayed and l've chosen you. You must win the sympathy of the cadre referent. They say they're going to move us from here. We would have to move again who knows where, here we can live at least. Don't ask me to do that, Sister Superior. How should l make him like me? You will find the way worthy of yourself. The cadre has to see us through you in a positive light. That's the only way to save ourselves in front of God as well as in front of people. l have thought it over very well. l'm not asking you only in my own name. So, what's up, sisters? How do you do? Do you pray, meditate? You should take a bath before the journey! lt's a big test. Johnny! This is a good place, it will be nice to sit here. We will clean it out and put the tables here. - How many tables are there? - Fourteen! Fourteen big tables. lf it's not enough, you will get two or three more. Commrade director, isn't it too early? The harvest is only beginning! lt's not your business! Last year we began too late and then it looked accordingly. The kitchen will be here, it has to be near the water. Do you remember how the wood began to burn on the manor last year? They had no water and all the goulash was burnt. Will the convent squad come as well? You have to find some other dancers, otherwise you'll be sitting during the harvest festival! - The tables will be up there! - Where will we get them from? - We have the boards. - Allright. l'm entrusting the deputy with the preparation of the harvest festival. Pishta! Yeah? lf someone needs anything, go to him. - What are you doing here? - Waiting for you! Sorry, you have to walk. From here it's not far anymore. We are not here for a long time and we already have to move again? They say the cadre can arrange that we could stay here. And therefore l should influence him, to gain his sympathy so he will start seeing us in a better light. Please tell me, what sort of a man is he? But why do you confide in me? l don't know anyone here. Maybe it's silly, this strange duty of mine. You can try it with him, but you will still have to move. And believe me, it's the best thing that can happen to you. You will be all alone on that farm, surrounded only by the fields, people won't stare at your clothes... and there won't be so many curious ones when l'll come to see you at night. l'll give you a ride! The mayor walks around, orders to join the army, tinkle -jingle, tinkle -jingle, orders to join the army. l'm sure that under your leadership and with the effort of your brigade you will turn the unkempt farm into an ideal one that will become the pride of our estates. Glory to labour! We are moving the convent squad to the Ludvig court. lt's a godforsaken farm. - Have you thought it over well? - Why? lt would be a crucial mistake if they'd go there. Go stop them then. Let them stay here! And they will be lying again on the boards? Are you bothering me with the boards right now? Go! But this is a crucial thing. Just think. Have you thought about the idea to reeducate this convent collective, to divide it? Because that's why they've brought them here? While on the farm where you wanted to send them to they would continue to lead the monastic way of life? Our agronome engineer Demko. lt was his idea to send them to the Ludvig court. And we all agreed. The farm needs a stable work group and we have no better one than the convent squad. We agreed, but we didn't think about the consequences. That's right, didn't think about the consequences. Commrade Janchek is right. They have to be reeducated. What about starting with the boards? What boards? They sleep on the boards just like in a nunnery. What about bringing them real beds with mattresses? So, you see. lt's written that when he wanted to break the man, he surrounded him with comfort, threw him into a state which produces nothing but lazines, temptation and sin. Go, sisters! You, the oldest daughter, go instead of your father... l'll help you. No, papa. Leave me alone, at least here! Why have you come here at all? ... tinkle -jingle, tinkle -jingle, go instead of your father. No, daddy, l don't want, l don't want to fight... Mary my dear! No, l've already said so. They won't allow it. You can't stay with us, and not here either! But here there are old people like me. But they were not evicted. Papa, leave me alone. What do l have from you? Only misfortune. You've chased me out to become a nun. When l was still young l could have had children! But now what? l'm only a barren mother and a step-mother. Joe has stayed in Bohemia, in the borderland. We had a row and so l thought maybe l could stay with you... No! You can't stay with us. What would they say about it? The father a kulak and me a nun untill recently. They wouldn't leave us alone. l didn't get anything from the house. You forced me to become a nun. What was it all for? - Daddy, when will you give us the dinner? - Allright, come on. ln this new situation we remember the words of the Scripture about the negotiation of Moses and Aaron with the pharaoh, the Egyptian king. They begged him to free their enslaved people for three days. They wanted to lead them into the desert and to sacrifice to the Lord over there to not let the plague nor the sword fall upon them. But the pharaoh got angry and said they are stopping people from work. And he ordered to give them even more work. People had to obey the pharaoh. And it lasted like that for a long time. But in the end the Lord had lead the people into the promised land. So says the Second Book of Moses. A lot of humility is needed as well as a strong faith in the arrival of God's help. You can sit down. l welcome administrator Belan in our name. This is commrade Vrtina and commrade Janchek from the Regional National Committee. They came to... well, to visit our plant, to discuss important problems and to visit you, one of our ideal work collectives. l'm glad, commrades, that we've met, and l'd like to say it for all of us. We are glad you can find some time beside the work to heighten your maturity. Because in our sense, if you permit, in our sense of work it means, and l emphasize that... it's a guarantee of constantly growing dignity, even pride, not only in front of it, but also in front of the collective which wouldn't be so strong without it, so strong as it really is! Slowly! Just guard them, old man! l'm the one who needs to be guarded! They are beasts! Quiet! And what's the name of this commrade? Well, actually, l don't even know... But maybe commrade Demko is informed. l guess he knows a lot about female collectives. Me? Well, if you wish... l know what l know. l only know she's called Klemencia. lt's her convent name. But here everybody calls her "commrade", well, except her collective. Do you also know the names of the older sisters? Please, something small before the dinner. Please, help yourself. But back to the matter, commrades. Their clothes are like a uniform and they also have another uniform, a grey one, for working in the fields. And l'm informed they work well. - lsn't he listening to us? - No, it can't be heard over there. Well, not all the uniforms are the same. That uniform is suspicious, dangerous. That's why they need to be divided and allowed to fully enjoy life. They could get married, start a family, but what can they do like this? Even the old ones? Not all of them are old. What about this one? And why is a nun serving us? She offered it herself. l agreed. When she's here, she's not there, get it? What do you think? To divide them, yes, but what if they'll go away? l need people, so where will l be looking for them? Ah, ladies. Sitting, sitting? We are not travelling in a carriage all day long like you do. Oh, come on! Soon l will be taking the harvest on that carriage. l didn't even clean it. What for? But how much l used to clean it! Even ten times a day. lt was important for His Majesty, our count. He had a telescope on his balcony, watched the stars at night, and in the morning, when l drove with the carriage under the balcony, with that telescope he could find even such a tiny bit of dirt. Sister Benedicta! Sister Klemencia is not back yet? lf you permit a few words... The first step has been done here, at the headquarters. We have removed the boards from their bedroom. The second step - we will eliminate the classroom! - What do you mean? - Who knows what they learn there. lt has to be controlled. Let me finish. The third step: the cadre clerk will explore their origin and will divide them from the class point of view. They could be separated one by one. And the fourth step could be... Back to the third step. Originally they were some sort of teachers. But not all of them were teaching. Some of them were... a kind of workers, like this one, but she is of kulak origin. And what about their uniforms? l'm reminding you all the time that such a uniform and a uniformity has to disappear. That's what l want to talk about, and that would be the fourth step. l propose to buy some fabric for civil clothing. Something pretty, colourful, bright, different for each one of them. They can make whatever dresses they want. But they need to be ordered to do so... These are concrete proposals. We should think about it, consider it. Well, we need some fresh air. What are you building here? A drying silo. We have no place for drying the grain. On the sheets it always gets wet with the rain. We have to start all over again. This is a wet land. That's right, the harvest is above all. And as for that matter... we must not play around with them for too long. We know what they're capable of. - Who? - The clergy, the church. We have experience with the priests. They were not sweet to us. Even now they incite and undermine. The cadre has already softened. Please, don't laugh at me, you know l'm not doing it for my own interest. l have information for you. Just like the last time. You must believe me, You must believe me, l will wait for you. The whole thing has to be approached tactically! We have to talk with the Superior and l would propose to propose her to convince her collective that they should wear a civil clothing. They must civilize themselves! Every single individual is capable of revolutionary transformation, we could approach it from this point. We've heard many inspiring ideas, they need to be considered, thought over, so that we'll proceed tactically and carefully. This is the basic principle: lf they'll strenghten their collective, they will disturb ours, but if we'll disturb their collective, we will only strenghten ours. And finally the classroom. l agree - who knows what they learn there. l wanted to remind already earlier that the classroom has to be emptied. We usually use it as a silo and we also need the chairs. And when they'll wear the civil clothing, every one of them will participate in life. ln human, worthy life. They will make it through! And l'd like to ask you a favour. Don't call them "commrades". - Sister Superior! - What's the matter, sister Benedicta? Sister Klemencia is missing. l know. Go to sleep, sister Benedicta. l can't! l can't go on anymore. l'm not that old yet! Do you hear it? Their guard ran away. lt will be fun here again! You're just laughing all the time. A drop of laughter is better than the sea of tears. A sea of laughter, a drop of tears, that's how it will be during the harvest festival. There it will be possible to talk with the cadre, with everyone, about everything. But it will be of no use, they've already decided about you. - Who? - Them. Wouldn't it be better to forget the cadre and the Superior and to surrender to this moment? Mr. engineer, don't humiliate me! There's a difference between me and your volunteers. You're afraid of the Superior. She's holding you like a hen holds her chicken. Alright, go to her! l have nowhere to go, neither the other sisters. Don't lie, you have. You can come even to my place. But you're afraid. You're afraid because you know nothing. They've put you into a nunnery when you were only a child. They've locked you among the walls, taught you to sleep on the boards and pray. They've taught you only about the love of God. About the other kind of love they've convinced you it's base, dirty, it needs to be killed inside you, forever destroyed like a weed. And you've believed it because you've never known it. That's why you're afraid. Even now, when there's no promise to bind you. Please, take me home. Don't run away from us, sister Klemencia. We are strong because we are together. That's what's good in you omes from our life, common in front of God as well as in front of people. Your sister ran away and what has she gained? Don't chase me out to them. l can't be blamed for my sister. l'm not running away. l want to live together with you. Don't chase me out to them. l'm afraid of them! Faith is stronger than fear. And are they worthy of your fear? They are not. They are not worthy of anything of yours! Neither of your tax, nor of your toll, neither of your honour, nor of your fear. Come on, let's pray! Now what? He left. Said he won't let them eat him. The dogs need to be fed. Feed them yourself! People are running away... And who will guard it here? l'm just moving the chairs over there. Maybe him? Johnny, skip! Stop it! And find Demko! You had many constructive ideas and so l thought that maybe you could talk to the Superior. Why me, commrade director? For us it's difficult to talk to her. l thought maybe the two of you will understand each other better. You have studied, she as well, so you will find a common platform more easily. l have to protest against that. What should l talk to her about? lsn't that only your business? lt is, but it's your idea, that, how did you call it? The fourth step, or whichever. And who came up with the idea of mattresses? And the chairs? lt's really only your business. lt's warm. lt's only morning and already so hot! Ugh! He won't let us down in it. And he has a connection with them. They've seen him with Klemencia. - Move faster! - No, the carriage would break down. The Superior needs to be talked to. lt's hot, such a uniform is not good for the summer, it's not even healthy. And that's why a new, light, civil clothing is needed. Good morning, commrade director. So, how is it going? Does it yield well? lt's not bad. lt's going quite well. Maybe she shouldn't be really convinced but given an order, just like with the boards. Deputy, we don't have the sacks! l'll fix it right away! l propose, and it's even among the intentions of the meeting, a new step. - We shall move them to another work place. - Where? The quarantine is not in order. They've criticised us for its state. There's a lot of work over there. We'll move the convent squad to the quarantine and then we'll ask the Superior. Are you sure? Can Johnnyskip put the quarantine in order alone? You, the middle daughter, go instead of your father... Here you are at least left in peace, Suzie my dear. Papa, who in this world is left in peace? And... are you doing well? ...No, daddy, l don't want, l don't want to fight... Suzie my dear, how can you stay here? And where should l stay? At home? l'm glad you didn't give up. l'd like to stay here. Among these? l'm sorry but that's impossible. Only they and we who take care of them are staying here. Come on, Sticky! How much more do we need? That was twenty four, six times four... that should be enough if it wasn't the same! lt's not the same! lt seems to me the same, only a little bit different. Let's go outside, we will measure it. Can we go outside to measure it? Let's go! He's not here. l don't know. He's not here either. And where did he go again? - l don't know. - So what, shall we take it? Let's take it. lt's the same! But why did you run off? We would measure it! l went to give them some water. lf you don't give them water, they run like crazy. What don't you say! Move on! We did what we could, we went to three shops and it's not our fault they don't have a wide variety, they'll have to understand that! Where are you going, commrade engineer? To the Ludvig court to call people together, l want to start the harvest over there! Tell them we'll come. But it's hard with him. And one more thing. The volunteers will leave, and you've sent the convent squad to the quarantine. Just now! lf we won't finish the harvest in time it won't be my fault! lt's because we don't have enough people. - Move faster! - But l do. Much faster! l'll show Demko! At first he makes us do it and then he laughs at us! But he will stop laughing, you bet! Because we shall make him responsible for all the problems which we have with the convent squad and which we will have yet! So! l'm going to give something to the dogs, it's impossible to listen to that anymore. Just go, they are already torturing even the innocent creatures. Here's something for you, too, don't sit here just like that. Good morning. l've also brought them something. They are also God's creatures, they want to eat. l've asked for it in the works kitchen. They say the dog accepts the food only from a good person, l've heard it somewhere. l'd like to propose you something, if you don't mind. This is not a job for you. l will feed them. l'm not against it, until we find a new guard. How are the dogs called? Rolf, that one is Matador and this pretty one Diokletian. Did you give them these names? - No, they did. - Who? Well... over there where they bred them. l don't like those names. You don't even like our names. Beata, Benedicta, Klemencia, am l not right? No, because there are also our names, prettier ones. You're not Klemencia but Terezia, right? And what if l really was Klemencia? l wouldn't like that as much. - So can l take care of them? - Allright, as you wish. And l'll give them new names. Diokletian will be Duncho. You can't do that, they are used to their names. You see. You, the oldest daughter... Papa! ...go instead of your father... We've invited you to talk and to tell you that in the convent squad, as we call you, there are various things we don't like. You mean we're working badly? No, we can't say that. And that's even not the point. We don't like your clothes. lt's a kind of monastic uniform. A different one, but it is. The clothes are not important, what's important is the person and what he or she does. Yes, the doing, but not the trouble! l'd like to hear what sort of trouble. We have no other goal than to work and be useful to you. The work is important. Actually, it's the priority, but there's a problem with the uniforms and with your way of life. How is it possible that other nuns have merged with life, so to speak, but you are constantly together just like in a nunnery, only you are here? We had nowhere to go. We don't want much, only to live together till the end of our common life. ln a collective, as you use to say. We don't want to hurt you but since you've mentioned it, not all the collectives are the same. Therefore we've decided to chat with you so that you'd take that uniform off because it's a demonstration of the old collective. What sort of demonstration? We live here almost all alone, far away from people. Even when we live far away, it's known what we do. That's why we've bought you some fabric and we thought you could make yourselves some dresses. Pretty, for the summer, civil, but not in a uniform way! Everybody a different one! One dress gets dirty and you put on another one. Look, Sister Superior, we wanted to be nice. You even have the slogan: Give the emperor what belongs to the emperor. You forgot the other half: And give God what belongs to God. l guess God doesn't care in what clothes you pray, but we care in what clothes you work and walk! l know you want to disturb our common life. You don't like our clothes because it's unified. But what about you? What about your uniform? That? That's a different thing, of the state. lt shows where we belong... who we are, that we belong to the state estate, and that has nothing to do with your uniform! We are left to your good will, you don't need our approval. We try to work, to achieve, as you say, good work results. But you are moving us from place to place, you are changing our beds, you took away our classroom... The silo will be there. You make us work with Johnnyskip. He walks around drunk, laughs at us, offends us, but you don't mind him. He wears the same cap as you do. He's a poor, harmless man, an idiot. You tell him: "Johnny, skip!" and he jumps. You should first sweep in front of your own door! Well, a glory is a glory and an honour is an honour but your piousness doesn't serve your honour well. What is Klemencia doing at nights with Demko? They've seen them. Do you think they pray together? l can call in Demko, he can tell whether it's a lie. Should l call him in? That's not necessary, l'll ask sister Klemencia. You forgot something. Please. l've met with him twice. Nothing more. And this is the price we shall pay for it. You did harm to us, sister Klemencia, through you they see all of us and they mock our faith. l begged you not to send me to them. l didn't send you to Demko! l see my mistake. lt came from the belief that you will find the way, estimate the limits... What has happened to you? Although the humiliation which we have to survive through you is big, we will pray for you. How are you doing, Terry my dear? We had a row with Joe, so l went to Mary. She doesn't want me, she's afraid. l went to Suzie as well, but she also doesn't want me. And you, Terry my dear, don't you want me as well? - Do you hear me, sister? - Yes. - Do you admit your fault? - l do. l will, daddy, l'm all right l will go to fight... Won't they find me here, chase me out? Don't be afraid, papa, nobody knows about you. The guard who lived here has left. l'll arrange they'll give you his job. But... will they agree? Don't worry, eat, l'll arrange it. Allright, Terry my dear. They are everywhere. You won't escape. You won't hide from them. l will ask him, too, he won't give us away, he can't be that bad. How do you like me, sister? Could l go to Demko like this? l have to feed the dogs. l'd also like to feed the dogs, l'd like to go to Demko as well, and to the cadre, too, to tell him l'm not Benedicta but Angie. Do you hear me, you scabby sheep? Not Benedicta but Angie! And you listen to me, too! Not Benedicta but Angie! An ordinary Angie! What do you have in that basket, Terry? The food for the volunteers. And can you take it? l can, just come eat. l hope they won't chase me out. Good morning, sisters! How pretty you are! - Good morning! - Morning. - Good morning. - Good morning. - And thank you very much. - You're welcome. Good morning, we brought the sewing machine. Welcome. Take a seat. And next time find a better amusement. l've already told you it's an order, an instruction! An order from the higher place, so why do you bother? You've let Demko play a trick on you and now you're doing silly things. And he's laughing at you. Hurry up, put your clothes on, say a prayer... What a job when they don't even understand you at home! And did you see them? They were already gone when we came. - Help yourself. - Thanks. But it was a hell lot of work. We will go to see them, to invite them to the harvest festival, so it will be seen and known in general. They sing nicely. But what do they sing? Well, they don't know anything else. ln time, they will learn our songs, too. Commrade director has a solo! Let's go! Let's all join them! Sing! Joy! Yes, you too! lf you don't mind, let's drink. - Cheers. - Cheers. Pishta! Even you are here? Cheers! The goulash is served! Johnny, that song of yours! l will, daddy, I'm all right, l will go to fight... We won't stay long, but we didn't want to offend you when you've invited us. Of course. After the good work you deserve a bit of fun. Please, join us. Please. - Are you Sister Superior? - Why do you ask? May God grant you a long life, my child. My dear sisters, something for you, too. Skip! For a good work, a good fun. May l? Just dance with her well! And we will have fun, too, my dear ones! Sister Klemencia! Congratulations, you are progressing. l'd like to ask you not to tell what you've seen. That l have my father here. l don't care about your father! l like you. Take off that kerchief, it doesn't suit you. You have a beautiful hair. Sister Klemencia! Come on, guys, let's take them, too! l think it's not necessary to separate anymore. Couldn't you employ him as a guard? They've evicted him, he has only me left. - Who evicted him? - Well, they did. We could do something, but also you could do something. Leave the convent squad! God's finger has touched us. Each one of us knows how much we've disgusted God yesterday and we all know how much evil can a single scabby sheep sow among us. You are young and therefore unwise. God didn't give you such a face to commit a sin and to mark us all with sin in front of God as well as in front of people. You will come back to us and repent. l can never come back to you. l've sensed from the very beginning that you are making a scabby sheep out of me. Already when you've sent me to the cadre for the first time. You needed a scabby sheep as a bad example! l feel pitty for you, sister Klemencia. We will pray for you so that the Most Merciful One wouldn't punish you for this thoughtless act. We have only our community in front of God and in front of people and you've marked it with sin. lnstead of a passionate repentance you commit another sin: blaming. Go, if you still have faith, and pray! And l have a plea. When you're leaving us, leave also the manor. We can't live here together. Your nearness humiliates us, marks us forever with the sin you've commited. l will tell the office so they can decide. Either you, or us! Because everywhere the husk is separated from the grain. Wow, how she chatters! lf we wouldn't need them l wouldn't listen to her. We have to finish the harvest, that's the priority, we must not forget that. And we don't have any other collective like that, we simply need them. And Klemencia? l feel sorry for her. But what can we do? She could find work on some farm but we can't accept her father, nobody would approve of employing such a man. And who would risk it? Commrade cadre, when he promised her that? ln other words, she has to decide as well. She can't live here together with her father. Sing, sisters. On the horse she rode like hell, three hundred Turks headless fell, tinkle -jingle, tinkle -jingle, three hundred Turks headless fell. THE END
