"Halka" directed by Konstanty Meglicki, was made in 1929 as a silent film. The National Film Archive in Poland stored only the final fragment of the last reel. In 1932 the producer released a new version. The film was re-edited, the design of the intertitles was changed, and it was musically illustrated with pieces from the Moniuszko opera, as well as other folk melodies and music works. Fragments of the original answer print were preserved alongside further picture and sound negative reels. All the materials have now been restored. Owing to the many different fragmented materials, and lacking relevant documentation the production and release of the film, it was impossible to recreate a final cut. This is a contemporary montage of preserved materials, utilising the original music by Jerzy Rogiewicz and reusing elements from the soundtrack made in 1932. WIR is proud to present the Polish film entitled HALKA based on the opera by Stanisław Moniuszko Director Main Cast: Jontek's arias: by a new talent with a world-famous name... Władysław Ladis, brother of the master of song, Jan Kiepura Halka's arias Choral pieces, polonaise and mazurka by the Warsaw Opera Conducted by Editing and musical illustration Sound and laboratory work Where the mountain tops meet the clouds... ...where the silver waves of the Dunajec swirl... lies a bustling village in a valley. The clanking of the old mill in tune with the mumbling of the old miller. HALKA Zorika SZYMANSKA - Here, I'll help you! JONTEK Włodzimierz CZERSKI - You are strong, Jontek! The old miller, for whom Halka, his orphaned granddaughter, was his only joy in life... Old miller Konstanty MEGLICKI - Have fun, children, while you're young. That day at the manor, Lady Odrowaz awaits her son, who is returning home after finishing school in the city. - You clot, the flour is spilling out! JANUSZ Harry CORT - Ho! Ho! You've grown, my boy! Near the manor was a pond, on whose banks could often be found Halka, the old miller's granddaughter. - No doubt you're thinking about a nice boy, my girl? - Give me your hand, I'll tell your fortune. - Ah, you will love... you'll have a lot of joy and suffering. Halina's soul was in a strange state of confusion. - I am Dziemba, and as the Squire's trusted friend, I know you will not be staying long at your mother's, when our lovely maidens find out you are back. - Here I am, talking away, and I have a letter for you, madam, which the Squire asked me to deliver. I have received your letter, madam, for which I am most grateful. Janusz's imminent return from school is making me immeasurably happy, as are our plans... - The Squire, your late father's friend, will be pleased to receive you at his home. The vision aroused by the Gypsy's fortune-telling followed Halka, disturbing the peace of the virgin's soul. And suddenly on the surface of the lake... - Don't run, stay! Why do you fear me so?? Don't you know who I am? - Probably the lord of the manor... - I have to go now... Where can I see you, miss? - I will be at the party on Sunday. Please come, sir. Overjoyed, she ran as if on wings... - Grandpa, I talked to the lord of the manor. So handsome and well-dressed! In a clearing outside the village. After vespers on Sunday, when the sun is still bright, After vespers on Sunday, when the sun is still bright, After vespers on Sunday, when the sun is still bright, The people will be cheered, after a hard week's work, Let them be cheered, after all their chores. She dressed up, thinking of him... The young master will soon come with his ladylove, There'll be coupling up in the manor, no man will be forgotten. There'll be coupling up in the manor, to forget about their toils. So let us make the day cheerful and joyous. Tomorrow is another working day, even more laborious. So let us make the day cheerful and joyous. - I would like you, Halka, to be friendly to Jontek at the dance. - Do not be my matchmaker so fast, grandpa. I'm in no hurry to marry. The young lord will welcome local people for the wedding. Oh, women, girls, you'll fall for the lord's charms, He's smooth, with a silver tongue, and a gentleman's face, OH, WOMEN! And when the lord arrived at sunset, the merriment and singing was in full swing and getting merrier. "This way, my lord, I will show you the new statue of Our Lady that the highlanders put in the rockface. She was taken by a childlike joy. He could hardly keep pace with her. Tomorrow is another working day, even more laborious. So let us make the day cheerful and joyous. So let us make the day cheerful and joyous. - Let us go back now, sir. It will get dark soon... Let's go and look at the highwayman's dance. Jontek was confiding in his beloved mountains about his longing and unrequited love for Halka. The fir trees whistle on the peaks, humming far uphill A young man's life is sad with regret in his heart. There's no other girl I cherish, but you Oh, Halina, my only one, my girl. As a child, I'd climb these rocks Looking for a nest on the cliff, for a bird to give you. I'd always pick the most beautiful mountain flowers for you, and indulge you with the shiniest beads Summers pass, they run like streams. The lord has come, now you discard me. I have no regrets to anyone but to you Oh, Halina, my only one, my girl. The days passed. In autumn, during haymaking... - Halka, what's wrong? Her ladyship, familiar with Janusz's every step, knew full well when to act. One day... - I have arranged with the Squire your marriage to Zosia. I ask you to visit them tomorrow. - I'll go, mother, if you so ask... but don't think that I can force my heart into slavery! Fulfilling his mother's categorical wishes, Janusz went to the Squire the next day, and swore to return for Halka soon. Zosia Zofja Lindorfowna - You could ride behind us, because the hooves are kicking up dust! "A nice boy, isn't he, aunt?" A horseshoe, sir... You know what that means? It's fate... it's good luck! - I would like to see her again one day... They rode on. Spring has come... awakening new life and uneven hopes for all. - Halka, for him?... Ha... ha... ha... - Halka is not stupid, she knows what to choose... - What's up, Jontek? The girl does not want you? - She prefers the lord to the peasant! - Stay away from me! - Leave Jontek alone. He's heartbroken enough. - Yes... yes, Jontek!... I was told to deliver dozens of rams. Our lord is marrying the Squire's daughter... If I could fly like a skylark in the morning sun, If I could be a swallow soaring in the sky! If were a fish in the river, I'd swim to you, My Janusz, to you... I am neither a fish swimming in the river, nor a skylark, nor a swallow. The wind's merely humming, he'll come back, he will. If I were a star in the rocks above the creek I'd look into your soul, and into your heart! I'd look into your soul, and into your heart! A will-o'-the-wisp with a pale light, If only a tear rolled down my cheek! Jontek, unable to calm down... Halina, did you know the lord is to marry the Squire's girl? - You're lying! - No, I swear to God! It's the talk of the village! - I agree, sir. Engagement here and wedding at the manor. - Where is his lordship? - Are you crazy...? He's at the Squire's, and you keep away from him! - It is such a pleasure, Zosia, when the heart discovers love... truly, for the first time... Jontek, take me to him... But swear to me that in any case you will not seek a quarrel with him, or hurt him. And you believe him, poor girl, that he's not deceiving you? As the wind whistles over the pastures, As the streams flow downhill, So he lied: he won't come here, So he lied: he won't come here. You poor girl, he's your lord! You poor girl, he's your lord! Remember: he's your lord! And you believed him, poor girl, that he's not deceiving you? You don't know what is love between a poor girl and a lord. You don't know, do you? His sweet talk, as sweet as a virgin's face! Tears won't melt his heart of stone, And you believe in his love! He's evil and he bought your poor soul, you don't know, Halka, how bad he is. Like a drought in spring needs rain, I loved you! I wanted you so much! Oh Halka! My poor girl! You believe he's not deceiving you? You think we're floating here, for you to be happy, full of joy, to see your Janusz, your boy? Janusz is taking that beautiful lady to dance! Leading his future wife by the arm. Oh, how beautiful they are, the two of them! It took all her strength for Halka to stay on her feet. Here's to the young couple and their engagement! May there be eternal love and harmony in their home! Long live the happy couple! They are two jewels, ancient symbols of virtue - Stay here, Jontek! I'll go alone... Look at them, the soul trembles, how well-matched they are! Janusz and Zofia are made for each other. They are two jewels, ancient symbols of virtue. The Pomian and Odrowaz families are tonight bound under one crest. Long live the happy couple! Brothers, thank you all! Raise your glasses, to your health! Let there be love, thanks to you! Yes, let there be love: Happiness to you all! Like a wind-broken bush, her soul was tormented. Where are you, rose wreath, with the lily whites within? He took it all away from me, he took my poor soul. I look for him all around, but I cannot find him... Ah! I can't... - Ah... - Who is it?... I will go and see. Oh where are you, my falcon, my sun in the clear blue sky? Like an ear of corn thrown into a field, so I will die, fading without you. - Zosia, go to our guests. - I'll talk to the poor girl and be right there. - I will explain everything to you. - Wait for me outside the manor, under the cross. On that cold night, she waited without sleep, trusting his words... And when at dawn they were dancing a white mazurka... - My lord!... Sir! - Janusz! - ...this is that deranged girl from the mill. Have her escorted out, let her go to her grandfather! Banished from the palace, and on the verge of madness, Halka did not know what to do... Expelled, shamed and riven with pain, Halka ran through the woodland. After hours of feeling faint... The place where faith and prayer soothe human suffering. While Halka was slowly coming round... ...her baby... was DYING. - Where's Halka, Jontek? Thanks to the care of the nuns, Halka returned to health. - Mother of Sorrows! Forgive my terrible sin... and forgive him the harm to me! Her longing for her child pushed Halka to escape from the convent. Inside the house was a new blow for Halka's breaking heart! Oh, my little one! Who will dress you, wrap you for the coffin? Oh my little one! Who will dress you for the coffin? - Are you dead?... No... you're only... - you're only sleeping. Oh, my little one! Who will dress you for the coffin? Oh, my little one! Who will dress you for the coffin? Who will sing you to... eternal sleep? Eternal sleep... to eternal sleep... The despair and bitterness in her heart overwhelmed her... - Where are you going, Halina? - I'm going... to church! Father of Heaven, Lord, Send us here on earth Our Father, send us here your mercy! It was not yet the end of Halka's suffering, because... ...in the church where she expected to find solace... ...she saw an unexpected sight... Janusz's wedding. The frenzy of vengeance overwhelmed Halka... ...but it was as if an unearthly force was holding her back. And it seemed that the Sorrowful Mother had spoken to her: "Ponder what I endured, and never did vindictive thoughts cross my mind." The torch with which she wanted to burn the church fell from her hand. There, from the cliff where her beloved made his false vows, in the strong current of the Dunajec... - She's dead? - Poor you, my... unhappy Halka! God Almighty, Lord God, Have mercy on your people! After all, your might can do everything. Ah, have mercy on us! And by thy son's torment, ease the poor misery of the... Wipe the tears, comfort the groans, Gracious God, have mercy! And so ended the suffering of the girl who left behind only her famous name, HALKA.
